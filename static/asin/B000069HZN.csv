707697,A2ZF78RQCO57FU,B000069HZN,Alec  Malczynski,"[16, 20]","At first, my impression on ""Big Fat Liar"" was that is was nothing more than dumb, Nickelodeon kid-flick; but then I saw it. I was very surprised by how it was very funny and very entertaining.  I'm a big Universal Studios fan, and this movie had A LOT of Universal stuff in it, including the imfamous backlot tour and the prop shop.The story is very famlish, never the less, clever.  Jason Shepard (TV's Malcolm in the Middle star Frankie Muniz) is a liar, straight off the bat.  He lies constainly about everything, espeacialy with the whole homework excuse ""My dog ate it"" or ""My dad is in the hospital (sniff)"".  But this time, his assignment was stolen...for real.  While trying to get to class, he is acidentally run over (don't worry, parents.  The scene is put on a cartoonish note) by a big-shot movie producer, Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who has been known to be a huge jerk to people.  Marty offers Jason a ride to school.  While the trip, Jason tell Marty about his paper homework due, title ""Big Fat Liar"", a story about a compulsive liar, who gets bigger each time he lies.  While being dropped off, Jason forgets his paper and Marty takes it.  A few months later, Jason and his best friend, Kaylee (Nickelodeon's Amanda Byrnes) go to the movies and see a trailer for a movie called ""Big Fat Liar"", which immediately makes Jason furious.  While Jason's parents are gone on vacation fo the summer, Jason and Kaylee take a trip to Los Angeles to find Wolf and get down to business.  Along the way, they befriend a actor-turned-limo driver, named Frank (Donald Adeosun Faison) and Marty's partner at the studio, Monty Kirkham (Amanda Detmer).  While Jason and Kaylee find shelter at Universal Studio's Prop shop, Jason Persues in finding Marty and getting either revenge or an appology.  During a rude encounter with Marty, Jason decides Vengence...all the way.  He and Kaylee form together all the people Wolf has been mean to and plot a payback to ge Marty out of Business,for good.One thing I liked about this movie was how it took place at Universal Studios Hollywood 75% of the time, aside from the obious (Monty, in one scene, is walking and talking on her cell phone in front of the Bates Motel House) there is the scene in the prop shop, were the kids shack up, where pieces of recent Universal films, such as ""The Grinch"", are left laying around, along with the DeLorean from ""Back to the Future"" shown everywhere and the constant showing of the Universal Backlot Tour trams driving by (I love how in one scene, Jason and Kaylee leap off a tram to see something: keep in mind that you could never do that in real life!).  BIG FAT LIAR is a great family film, but better for kids.  And it's the thing Universal fans, like me, been waiting for.",5,Surprisingly very good!,1014163200,"02 20, 2002",2002,2762,"['first', 'impression', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'was', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'dumb', 'Nickelodeon', 'kid-flick', 'then', 'saw', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'how', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'entertaining', ""'m"", 'big', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'fan', 'movie', 'had', 'LOT', 'Universal', 'stuff', 'including', 'imfamous', 'backlot', 'tour', 'prop', 'shop.The', 'story', 'very', 'famlish', 'never', 'less', 'clever', 'Jason', 'Shepard', 'TV', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'star', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'liar', 'straight', 'off', 'bat', 'constainly', 'everything', 'espeacialy', 'whole', 'homework', 'excuse', 'dog', 'ate', 'dad', 'hospital', 'sniff', 'time', 'assignment', 'was', 'stolen', 'real', 'trying', 'get', 'class', 'acidentally', 'run', 'over', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'parents', 'scene', 'put', 'cartoonish', 'note', 'big-shot', 'movie', 'producer', 'Marty', 'Wolf', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'who', 'been', 'known', 'be', 'huge', 'jerk', 'people', 'Marty', 'Jason', 'ride', 'school', 'trip', 'Jason', 'tell', 'Marty', 'paper', 'homework', 'due', 'title', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'story', 'compulsive', 'liar', 'who', 'bigger', 'time', 'being', 'dropped', 'off', 'Jason', 'paper', 'Marty', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'Jason', 'best', 'friend', 'Kaylee', 'Nickelodeon', 'Amanda', 'Byrnes', 'go', 'movies', 'see', 'trailer', 'movie', 'called', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'immediately', 'Jason', 'furious', 'Jason', 'parents', 'are', 'gone', 'vacation', 'fo', 'summer', 'Jason', 'Kaylee', 'take', 'trip', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'find', 'Wolf', 'get', 'down', 'business', 'way', 'befriend', 'actor-turned-limo', 'driver', 'named', 'Frank', 'Donald', 'Adeosun', 'Faison', 'Marty', 'partner', 'studio', 'Monty', 'Kirkham', 'Amanda', 'Detmer', 'Jason', 'Kaylee', 'find', 'shelter', 'Universal', 'Studio', 'Prop', 'shop', 'Jason', 'Persues', 'finding', 'Marty', 'getting', 'revenge', 'appology', 'rude', 'encounter', 'Marty', 'Jason', 'Vengence', 'way', 'Kaylee', 'form', 'together', 'people', 'Wolf', 'been', 'mean', 'plot', 'payback', 'ge', 'Marty', 'Business', 'good.One', 'thing', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'took', 'place', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Hollywood', '75', '%', 'time', 'aside', 'obious', 'Monty', 'one', 'scene', 'walking', 'talking', 'cell', 'phone', 'front', 'Bates', 'Motel', 'House', 'scene', 'prop', 'shop', 'were', 'kids', 'shack', 'up', 'where', 'pieces', 'recent', 'Universal', 'films', 'such', 'Grinch', 'are', 'left', 'laying', 'around', 'DeLorean', 'Back', 'Future', 'shown', 'everywhere', 'constant', 'showing', 'Universal', 'Backlot', 'Tour', 'trams', 'driving', 'love', 'how', 'one', 'scene', 'Jason', 'Kaylee', 'leap', 'off', 'tram', 'see', 'something', 'keep', 'mind', 'could', 'never', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'BIG', 'FAT', 'LIAR', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'better', 'kids', 'thing', 'Universal', 'fans', 'been', 'waiting']",N/A

This was one such film.  It is, however, entertaining to see Frankie Muniz take on the role of a 13 year old pathological liar who needs to earn back the trust of his parents after repeatedly being unable to submit an English literature paper to avoid summer school.  The reason for this delinquency is Marty Wolf, a grown up version of what Frankie would be if he doesn't change his ways soon.  Marty is the world's biggest liar, and when he comes across Frankie's English paper and goes off to create the year's hottest film based on the story, Frankie wants revenge.  So together with his best friend, Amanda Biele, they set off for Hollywood in search of an apology from Marty which eventually turned out to be an all-out revenge against him (as there are many others who have come across his rude, insensitive and evil path).  Needless to say, the story does have a happy ending.  And it was entertaining from the point of view of the teenagers around me.  So I had fun suspending my disbelief for an hour and a half.",4,You've watched Disney films with talking dogs haven't you?,1014854400,"02 28, 2002",2002,1146,"['When', 'movies', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'picky', 'watch', 'almost', 'anything', 'Even', 'films', 'target', 'audience', 'teenagers', 'was', 'one', 'such', 'film', 'however', 'entertaining', 'see', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'take', 'role', '13', 'year', 'old', 'pathological', 'liar', 'who', 'earn', 'back', 'trust', 'parents', 'repeatedly', 'being', 'unable', 'submit', 'English', 'literature', 'paper', 'avoid', 'summer', 'school', 'reason', 'delinquency', 'Marty', 'Wolf', 'grown', 'up', 'version', 'what', 'Frankie', 'would', 'be', ""n't"", 'change', 'ways', 'soon', 'Marty', 'world', 'biggest', 'liar', 'when', 'Frankie', 'English', 'paper', 'off', 'create', 'year', 'hottest', 'film', 'based', 'story', 'Frankie', 'revenge', 'together', 'best', 'friend', 'Amanda', 'Biele', 'set', 'off', 'Hollywood', 'search', 'apology', 'Marty', 'eventually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'all-out', 'revenge', 'are', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'rude', 'insensitive', 'evil', 'path', 'Needless', 'say', 'story', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', 'entertaining', 'point', 'view', 'teenagers', 'So', 'had', 'fun', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'hour', 'half']",N/A

Beverly""","[2, 2]","With  both teenagers and an 19 month old daughter I tend to watch the whole gambit of movies from Wiggles videos, Disney movies to serious drama.  This movie kind of falls into a middle zone that makes it one that I  won't be watching again any time soon.  It was way to silly for my teenagers to consider worth watching and the comedy and characters way above my little ones head.That being said I felt it was definitely a good family movie (provided the audience is in the right age group, probably 7 to 11 give or take).It had some scenes that I considered funny, watching as a somewhat critical adult that I am, but not nearly enough of the humor or gags were funny enough to make it a classic.  The main character was supposed to be a certain type of hero (say like a Ferris Bueller) but the movie just didn't have enough there to make him into a memorable figure.  That isn't to say the acting wasn't first rate, it because it was very good, but that the situations and story line just weren't up to it.I certainly recommend this as a good clean fun family movie, but not necessarily as part of a family collection of movies to watch over and over.

707700,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000069HZN,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","As far as kids movies are concerned, there are few better than this one.  I'm not usually one to gush over these kinds of movies, but this one keeps me entertained (sure, in a cheesy kind of way) each and every time I watch it.  Each gag, each joke, each scene is just fun and exciting.Yeah, I like this one; a lot.The films premise is pretty cool too.  Jason is a young kid of fourteen who has an issue with lying (what kid doesn't), and his bad behavior has landed him in some trouble.  Jason is the definition of the `boy who cried wolf', and so when he actually tells the truth (that his essay was stolen by a movie mogul who is now plagiarizing by turning his story into a major motion picture) no one believes him; except his best friend Kaylee (but she may not even `really' believe him).  When opportunity arises (as it often does in these films), Jason and Kaylee make their way to Hollywood in order to expose this creep and earn the trust of Jason's parents.The whole idea of young kids using their imaginations to create something excites me, because I was once that kid, dreaming of writing something so amazing it became a movie!The acting here is very good for a film in this genre, and character actor Paul Giamatti is at the top of the pack.  I mean, when is he NOT good (don't answer that...I did see `Lady in the Water', but he was far from the worst part of that mess)?  I admit to never having ever seen an episode of `Malcolm in the Middle', but I've seen a few of Frankie Muniz's movies and I really think that for a child actor he is quite good (can you believe he's not a child anymore?).  Amanda Bynes is a gimmick, but she's so incredibly enjoyable (I've said this before) and I heart her so I have nothing but praise for her here as well.What makes the film pop though is the smart writing.  This has been done before (you know, smart kids + stupid adults = war) but this feels new and fresh to me.  Each gag feels surprising and what is cool about this is that it manages to impress with each viewing.  I've seen this a few times and every time I see it I laugh and enjoy myself.  In fact, this was on cable last night, and I watched it from start to finish.It's that much fun.",5,"If I'm hatin', I'm lyin'...",1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,2206,"['As', 'far', 'kids', 'movies', 'are', 'concerned', 'are', 'few', 'better', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'one', 'gush', 'kinds', 'movies', 'one', 'entertained', 'sure', 'cheesy', 'kind', 'way', 'time', 'watch', 'gag', 'joke', 'scene', 'just', 'fun', 'exciting.Yeah', 'like', 'one', 'lot.The', 'films', 'premise', 'pretty', 'cool', 'too', 'Jason', 'young', 'kid', 'fourteen', 'who', 'issue', 'lying', 'what', 'kid', ""n't"", 'bad', 'behavior', 'landed', 'trouble', 'Jason', 'definition', 'boy', 'who', 'cried', 'wolf', 'so', 'when', 'actually', 'truth', 'essay', 'was', 'stolen', 'movie', 'mogul', 'who', 'now', 'plagiarizing', 'turning', 'story', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'one', 'best', 'friend', 'Kaylee', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'really', 'believe', 'When', 'opportunity', 'often', 'films', 'Jason', 'Kaylee', 'make', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'order', 'expose', 'creep', 'earn', 'trust', 'Jason', 'parents.The', 'whole', 'idea', 'young', 'kids', 'using', 'imaginations', 'create', 'something', 'excites', 'was', 'once', 'kid', 'dreaming', 'writing', 'something', 'so', 'amazing', 'became', 'movie', 'acting', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'genre', 'character', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'top', 'pack', 'mean', 'when', 'NOT', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'answer', 'did', 'see', 'Lady', 'Water', 'was', 'far', 'worst', 'part', 'mess', 'admit', 'never', 'having', 'ever', 'seen', 'episode', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'movies', 'really', 'think', 'child', 'actor', 'quite', 'good', 'can', 'believe', 'not', 'child', 'anymore', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'gimmick', 'so', 'incredibly', 'enjoyable', ""'ve"", 'said', 'before', 'heart', 'so', 'have', 'nothing', 'praise', 'here', 'film', 'pop', 'though', 'smart', 'writing', 'been', 'done', 'know', 'smart', 'kids', '+', 'stupid', 'adults', '=', 'war', 'new', 'fresh', 'gag', 'feels', 'surprising', 'what', 'cool', 'impress', 'viewing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'time', 'see', 'laugh', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'was', 'cable', 'last', 'night', 'watched', 'start', 'finish.It', 'much', 'fun']",N/A

He is given the ultimatum of writing the paper or being sent to summer school. So Frankie starts writing a fact-based story titled BIG FAT LIAR (clever). He completes the task and heads off to school to hand it in.However while biking to school he is struck by a limo; whose passenger happens to be Marty Wolfe (Paul Giamatti) a famed Hollywood producer.To make amends, Wolfe offers to give  Jason a ride to school... but on arriving Jason discovers he's left his assignment behind. Of course when Jason tells his teacher the story, she doesn't believe him and she calls a meeting with his parents. So to prove to his parents that this time he's really telling the truth Jason must try and get his paper back from Wolfe.But Wolfe has other plans, like turning Jason's paper into a major film (which he steals all credit for). A pretty smart move for a guy currently making a movie starring Jaleel &quot;Urkel&quot; White as a cop with a chicken for a partner. Sure-fire blockbuster material.So in order to get his script back Jason and his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) fly to L.A to try and let the truth be known. But Wolfe, nice guy that he is; sets fire to Jason's script. Is that the end? No. Because as even the most dimwitted Hollywood types know, you always make a back-up copy.So Jason and Kaylee have no option left but to play dirty. With the help of downtrodden film industry employees who've been burned by Wolfe one time too many; they set out to teach him a lesson once and for all. Which means loads of clumsy slapstick humor, which will really appeal to the kids.Adults will enjoy seeing the PSYCHO house and other setpieces from movie classics on display here. Some of it's funny, some of it's feeble, but you could do far worse.DVD Extras include commentary by the director and Muniz, location doco, deleted scenes, trailer and a pretty tacky &quot;tour&quot; of the Universal Studios lot with scenes from the film.

He lies to his teachers, he lies to his parents, he lies to *everybody* it seems.One day after writing a short story for a school assignment, he gets mixed up with a movie producer in a limousine incident and forgets to take his story with him after leaving the car.  Well, being the crooked thief that the movie producer is portrayed as,  he picks it up, steals Frankie's idea, and eventually makes a movie out of it.When Frankie's character goes to a movie theater and sees his ideas being utilized on the big screen, he tries to explain to everyone that his story was stolen, but guess what?  Yup, you guessed it- NOBODY believes him!  From here the storyline kicks in.It's about Frankie getting his revenge on the guy who stole his short story by constantly humiliating and torturing him.  Unfortunately for us (the viewers) many of the practical jokes aren't that funny.  At least, I feel they could have been better.  The only time I was really impressed is when blue ink was dumped in the swimming pool and turning the man blue from head to toe.  The rest of the jokes fell completely flat.I really hated the one where Frankie's character forced the crooked movie producer to jump out of a helicopter, and the one involving his car getting smashed was pretty terrible as well.  Just a lot of missed opportunities for humor.Overall, well the kids probably won't mind the many humorless segments, but us adults will notice them immediately.

Universal has done an excellent job of bringing an amazing cast together to tell a really good story.  The movie is about Jason Shepherd (played by Frankie Muniz), who is a compulsive liar and happens to have his short story stolen by Hollywood producer Mary Wolf (played by Paul Giamatti).  As a result of the stolen story, Jason must attend summer school.  Jason soon sees that Marty is going to be making the story into a movie.  In a well conceived plan, Jason and his best friend Kaylee (played by Amanda Bynes) head out to Hollywood to confront Marty.  Jason only wanted a simple phone call to his father to show that he was telling the truth.  Marty doesn't agree to it and in turn has Jason escorted out by security.  A bit upset, Jason decides that payback is a must.  Over the course of a weekend Jason and Kaylee have it out with Marty by conducting various retaliations, including making him look like a Smurf.  (The other retaliations are also quite hilarious.)  Eventually Marty and Jason square off on the rooftop of a movie set and this is where everybody gets to see the kind of person Marty truly is.  The film ends on a high note where Jason gets his revenge...and a little bit more.  The film is one that anyone can enjoy, and with cameos by Lee Majors, Dustin Diamond and even Jaleel White, laughs are guaranteed.  Even the bonus features make this disc a treat.  There is a trivia challenge featuring other Universal films, deleted scenes which are pretty good, a behind the scenes feature, an &quot;Are You A Big Fat Liar&quot; quiz, and Amanda Bynes even gets to help you navigate through the menus!  Lastly, the two commentaries are a nice add-on.  One features the director Shawn Levy with the other one by Frankie Muniz.  Overall, I highly recommend this film.  Frankie and Amanda make an excellent team, and in picking up this film you are guaranteed to have some big fat fun.",5,An Excellent Film For All....,1038182400,"11 25, 2002",2002,1957,"['Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Universal', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'amazing', 'cast', 'together', 'tell', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Shepherd', 'played', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'who', 'compulsive', 'liar', 'have', 'short', 'story', 'stolen', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'Mary', 'Wolf', 'played', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'result', 'stolen', 'story', 'Jason', 'must', 'attend', 'summer', 'school', 'Jason', 'soon', 'Marty', 'going', 'be', 'making', 'story', 'movie', 'well', 'conceived', 'plan', 'Jason', 'best', 'friend', 'Kaylee', 'played', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'head', 'Hollywood', 'confront', 'Marty', 'Jason', 'only', 'wanted', 'simple', 'phone', 'call', 'father', 'show', 'was', 'telling', 'truth', 'Marty', ""n't"", 'agree', 'turn', 'Jason', 'escorted', 'out', 'security', 'bit', 'upset', 'Jason', 'payback', 'must', 'course', 'weekend', 'Jason', 'Kaylee', 'have', 'out', 'Marty', 'conducting', 'various', 'retaliations', 'including', 'making', 'look', 'Smurf', 'other', 'retaliations', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'Eventually', 'Marty', 'Jason', 'square', 'rooftop', 'movie', 'set', 'where', 'everybody', 'see', 'kind', 'person', 'Marty', 'truly', 'film', 'high', 'note', 'where', 'Jason', 'revenge', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'film', 'one', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'cameos', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'Dustin', 'Diamond', 'even', 'Jaleel', 'White', 'laughs', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'Even', 'bonus', 'features', 'make', 'disc', 'treat', 'trivia', 'challenge', 'featuring', 'other', 'Universal', 'films', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'scenes', 'feature', 'quot', 'Are', 'A', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'quot', 'quiz', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'even', 'help', 'navigate', 'menus', 'Lastly', 'two', 'commentaries', 'are', 'nice', 'add-on', 'One', 'director', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'other', 'one', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'Frankie', 'Amanda', 'make', 'excellent', 'team', 'picking', 'up', 'film', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'have', 'big', 'fat', 'fun']",N/A

The storyline is simple.  Muniz tells lies, he gets in trouble and must turn in his paper entitled BIG FAT LIAR.  However, in his rush to deliver the paper to his teacher, he crashes into producer Narty Wolf's limo, played by Paul Giamatti.  Wolf reluctantly gives him a lift and the boy accidentally leaves his paper.  Wolf takes it and claims it for his own, deciding to make it into a movie.  The kids try to get a confession from Wolf but he refuses.  Efforts to force him to do so is where the movie really gets interesting.It is an interesting film, better than I expected.  There is no hint of romantic tension between the kids, they are just friends.  Jason, played by Muniz, also learns a lesson against lying, particularly if he does not want to grow like the deceitful movie producer.Toward the end of the film, Wolf gets attacked by a kid in a ""nut"" cracking move.  We are not shown the hit, but the intimation is clear that it is unfortunate pelvic humor.  It is unfortunate that such stale pitfalls are still considered funny.The out takes are very revealing.  Evidently the chicken (who played an actor in another movie) was originally scripted as inadvertantly eatten by the producer-- no doubt another of the stunts orchestrated by the two youths to force a confession.  I suspect that it made the kids look too malicious, and it would certainly offend vegetarian members of PETA.  This scene comes as part of a seduction attempt upon a well-endowed woman in the producer's trailor.  It is interrupted, but he tries to get her to wear a skimpy bikini, under the guise of an audition for a beach movie.

Film Critic Willow Jones shares her review of this film:I really like the mood of this story!Big Fat Liar is about a boy named Jason Shepard (Frankie Muniz), who likes getting out of doing things like his homework when he doesn't feel like doing it by lying.  Most of the time when he lies he gets caught.  Now, Jason has only a few hours to write a thousand-word essay.  Jason finally gets it done, but is running late for school.  On his way Jason runs into Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), a Hollywood producer, and begs Marty to give him a ride to school.  Jason gets to school on time, but leaves his homework in the limo with Marty.  Marty reads the paper and likes it so much he decides to turn it into a movie and claim it was his idea.  Much like in the story of the boy who cried wolf, when Jason tells his parents and teacher the movie was from his essay, no one believes him.  Jason decides to travel to LA to find Marty and make him tell the truth.  Jason asks his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) to come along and help him.Technically, the film was good overall, but the sound was weak and should have been louder.  The acting was quite good.  I enjoyed Paul Giamatti's character a lot because he really brought out the humor.I think the story is interesting.  My eyes were glued to the screen waiting to see what would happen next.

707733,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000069HZN,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","""Big Fat Liar"" offers a lively contemporary spin on the Boy Who Cried Wolf legend.  Jason Shepherd is a 14-year-old inveterate liar who spends most of his time devising elaborate yarns to keep himself out of trouble with his parents and teachers.  One day, through an amazing fluke, he meets up with a nefarious movie producer named Marty Wolf who steals Shepherd's story idea - a composition he wrote for his English class entitled ""Big Fat Liar"" - and proceeds to make a movie out of it.  When Jason's parents refuse to believe their son's outlandish tale, the youngster heads out to Hollywood to confront Wolf and make him verify his story.  When Wolf refuses to do this, Jason concocts an elaborate scheme to make Wolf's life a living hell until he relents and helps make things right back home.Kids will love ""Big Fat Liar"" for the simple reason that it works as pure adolescent fantasy wish-fulfillment on several levels.  First, it shows a youngster getting the rare opportunity of turning a major studio backlot into his own personal playground (the film sometimes feels like a 90-minute commercial for Universal Studios' behind-the-scenes tour).  Second, it feeds the desire we all have to watch the tables being turned on a certified rascal.  And, third, like any good fantasy for children, it puts the kids in a position of power over the adult world.  Jason and his pretty cohort, Kaylee, get to call the shots and pull the strings that eventually get the grownups to pay attention and listen to them.""Big Fat Liar"" might actually have been a better film had it resisted the tendency to overdo so much of its comedy.  In fact, the best parts of the film occur near the beginning when Jason and his adventures stay connected to the real world.  Once he gets to Hollywood, the film loses a bit of its edge.  The cleverness and wit of the film's opening stretches give way to overwrought plot mechanics and over-the-top slapstick.  The film has a great deal of undeniable energy, but subtlety can be a virtue as well and we miss that sense of sly fun that defines the film's ambiance early on.Still, ""Big Fat Liar"" has more to recommend it than the average teen comedy.  First of all, it stars the marvelous Frankie Muniz (""Malcolm in the Middle"") who has energy and charm to spare in the role of Jason and who literally keeps the film bouncing along even when the comic setups don't always pay off as well as they should.  Muniz is one child actor I will miss when he grows too old to still play these parts.  Amanda Byrnes is equally likable as Jason's conspiratorial companion, Kaylee.  And even though Paul Giamatti seems to be doing a Jim Carrey impersonation through large sections of the film, this fine comic actor hits heights of magnificent manic madness as the put-upon, hissable villain of the piece.  The movie also has a fun time ribbing many of the elements of Hollywood culture - from the unemployed ""actors"" working as chauffeurs to the has-beens looking for that big career turnabout to the insipid material that often serves as the basis for big studio productions (a movie about a cop teamed up with a crime-fighting chicken is the example here).""Big Fat Liar"" provides mixed blessings for the sophisticated adult audience, but youngsters should enjoy it all.",3,"Fun, if over-the-top, comic fantasy",1038614400,"11 30, 2002",2002,3288,"['Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'lively', 'contemporary', 'spin', 'Boy', 'Who', 'Cried', 'Wolf', 'legend', 'Jason', 'Shepherd', '14-year-old', 'inveterate', 'liar', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'devising', 'elaborate', 'yarns', 'keep', 'trouble', 'parents', 'teachers', 'One', 'day', 'amazing', 'fluke', 'up', 'nefarious', 'movie', 'producer', 'named', 'Marty', 'Wolf', 'who', 'Shepherd', 'story', 'idea', 'composition', 'wrote', 'English', 'class', 'entitled', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'proceeds', 'make', 'movie', 'When', 'Jason', 'parents', 'refuse', 'believe', 'son', 'outlandish', 'tale', 'youngster', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'confront', 'Wolf', 'make', 'verify', 'story', 'When', 'Wolf', 'do', 'Jason', 'elaborate', 'scheme', 'make', 'Wolf', 'life', 'living', 'hell', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'back', 'home.Kids', 'will', 'love', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'simple', 'reason', 'pure', 'adolescent', 'fantasy', 'wish-fulfillment', 'several', 'levels', 'First', 'youngster', 'getting', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'turning', 'major', 'studio', 'backlot', 'own', 'personal', 'playground', 'film', 'sometimes', 'feels', '90-minute', 'commercial', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'behind-the-scenes', 'tour', 'Second', 'desire', 'have', 'watch', 'tables', 'being', 'turned', 'certified', 'rascal', 'third', 'good', 'fantasy', 'children', 'kids', 'position', 'power', 'adult', 'world', 'Jason', 'pretty', 'cohort', 'Kaylee', 'get', 'call', 'shots', 'pull', 'strings', 'eventually', 'get', 'grownups', 'pay', 'attention', 'listen', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'resisted', 'tendency', 'overdo', 'so', 'much', 'comedy', 'fact', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'occur', 'beginning', 'when', 'Jason', 'adventures', 'stay', 'connected', 'real', 'world', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'bit', 'edge', 'cleverness', 'wit', 'film', 'opening', 'stretches', 'give', 'way', 'overwrought', 'plot', 'mechanics', 'over-the-top', 'slapstick', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'undeniable', 'energy', 'subtlety', 'can', 'be', 'virtue', 'as', 'well', 'miss', 'sense', 'sly', 'film', 'ambiance', 'early', 'on.Still', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'more', 'recommend', 'average', 'teen', 'comedy', 'First', 'all', 'marvelous', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'who', 'energy', 'charm', 'spare', 'role', 'Jason', 'who', 'literally', 'film', 'bouncing', 'along', 'even', 'when', 'comic', 'setups', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'pay', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'Muniz', 'one', 'child', 'actor', 'will', 'miss', 'when', 'too', 'old', 'still', 'play', 'parts', 'Amanda', 'Byrnes', 'equally', 'likable', 'Jason', 'conspiratorial', 'companion', 'Kaylee', 'even', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'be', 'doing', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'impersonation', 'large', 'sections', 'film', 'fine', 'comic', 'actor', 'heights', 'magnificent', 'manic', 'madness', 'put-upon', 'hissable', 'villain', 'piece', 'movie', 'also', 'fun', 'time', 'ribbing', 'many', 'elements', 'Hollywood', 'culture', 'unemployed', 'actors', 'working', 'chauffeurs', 'has-beens', 'looking', 'big', 'career', 'turnabout', 'insipid', 'material', 'often', 'basis', 'big', 'studio', 'productions', 'movie', 'cop', 'teamed', 'up', 'crime-fighting', 'chicken', 'example', 'here', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'mixed', 'blessings', 'sophisticated', 'adult', 'audience', 'youngsters', 'should', 'enjoy']",N/A

Smith,"[0, 8]","Parents, if you have teens, or pre-teens, who are fans of Frankie Muniz (Malcom in the Middle) or Nickelodeon star Amanda Bynes, chances are they will ask to buy/rent ""Big Fat Liar.""  And you probably will do so, expecting a light kid's movie.Spawned by former ""Head of the Class"" regulars Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (both of whom have been involved in various Nickelodeon shows), what will follow for an adult watching is increasing degrees of drowsiness, until you've collapsed onto the floor in a stupor.  The kids will love it (the movie and watching you fall to the floor).The plot: Pathological liar Jason Shepherd (Muniz) finds himself in a bind: it's the end of the school year, his grades are bad, and he needs to compose an essay in order to avoid summer school.  He rushes home, pens an essay called ""Big Fat Liar,"" and rushes back to school (on a girl's bike, ho-ho) to turn the essay in.  On his way to school he crashes into a limo.  The occupant is Marty Wolf, hotshot Hollywood producer, played with some glee by Paul Giamatti.  Wolf is your stereotypical Hollywood producer, who does a lot of yelling at people, whether in person or on the phone.  You see, Wolf is mean.  Shepherd convinces Wolf to give him a ride to school, which he does.  And now, the plot begins its descent into fantasy land.  Jason's essay was left behind in the limo, and Wolf ends up stealing it to create his next big movie.And so it goes.  Jason and his girlfriend Kaylee (Bynes), while watching a movie, see a preview for the next Marty Wolf production: ""Big Fat Liar.""  What follows is a series of ever increasing inexplicable events, as the two teenagers somehow get their way from Michigan to LA without anyone being suspicious (Jason pays for the tickets with a big wad of cash.  Wouldn't a ticket agent be slightly suspicious?)Once in LA, Jason confronts Wolf and asks him to tell his father that the essay was indeed written by Shepherd and that Wolf had stolen it.  Wolf refuses.  So it's up to Jason and Kaylee to get their revenge, which they do through a number of ""funny"" revenge bits.  Virtually every action they take against Wolf is illegal, but the movie ignores that so we can laugh (well, the kids will laugh) as Wolf is turned blue, has his expensive car crushed, etcetera, blah blah blah.  The teens enlist the help of what seems to be dozens of adults, all of whom had been victimized by Wolf, and in the end, the mean old Wolf has his life ruined and the young vandals/thieves get their reward.At this point, you may have emerged from your state of semi-consciousness.

""Big Fat Liar"" has everything for kids, and adults will also love it.  The movie pits young 14 year old Jason Shepard, an adept liar in his own right, against the viscious Marty Wolf, an expert liar who shows Jason how far a lie can go to destroy the lives of others.  Both hero and villain are closely linked, as Wolf is just like Shepard taken to an extreme, showing the young Jason what he could become as an adult if he doesn't learn his lesson.  The film is a perfect vehicle for actor Frankie Munez, who shines as Shepard and obviously has fun enacting revenge on Wolf, and both Munez and Amanda Bynes, who plays Jason's close friend, represent the youth of America in a positive way.  Paul Giamatti is the perfect Marty Wolf, who vows to never admit the truth even in the face of humiliation.

Thanks in HUGE part to the phenomenal performance of Paul Giamatti, BFL takes a unique idea, some excellent cameo casting (you gotta love Jaleel White with the self-effacing work he does here), and the fairly restrained performance of Frankie Muniz and concocts a funny and well done albeit innocuous little cinematic treat. Muniz could've gone overboard which other young actors succumb to but he stays in check for the most part and allows the rest of cast to do what they do. Again, without Giamatti, this movie is a throw-away, but his performance is delicious and never fails to make me laugh no matter how many times I hear his caustic remarks. He is just so, so good here!Given how awful many movies that focus on kids outsmarting adults often are, this movie takes that dangerous premise and, thanks to building the kids' success on the help of other adults, the movie succeeds.Worth seeing for Giamatti alone, Big Fat Liar is a great time!",4,Great time!,1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,1080,"['such', 'entertaining', 'fast-moving', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'years', 'always', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'Thanks', 'HUGE', 'part', 'phenomenal', 'performance', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'BFL', 'unique', 'idea', 'excellent', 'cameo', 'casting', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'Jaleel', 'White', 'self-effacing', 'work', 'here', 'fairly', 'restrained', 'performance', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'funny', 'well', 'done', 'albeit', 'innocuous', 'little', 'cinematic', 'treat', 'Muniz', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'overboard', 'other', 'young', 'actors', 'succumb', 'check', 'most', 'part', 'rest', 'cast', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'Again', 'Giamatti', 'movie', 'throw-away', 'performance', 'delicious', 'never', 'make', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'hear', 'caustic', 'remarks', 'just', 'so', 'so', 'good', 'here', 'Given', 'how', 'awful', 'many', 'movies', 'focus', 'kids', 'outsmarting', 'adults', 'often', 'are', 'movie', 'dangerous', 'premise', 'thanks', 'building', 'kids', 'success', 'help', 'other', 'adults', 'movie', 'succeeds.Worth', 'seeing', 'Giamatti', 'alone', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'great', 'time']",N/A

707740,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000069HZN,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","This surprisingly entertaining kids film in the tradition of &quot;Home Alone&quot; stars two likable kids stars -- Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes.  Adults, like me, will find the film's lack of originality, but still admit that everything is done with good pace.Of course, as kids movie, Muniz's character Jason, 14-year-old Michigan boy, is a fibber, not &quot;a big fat liar&quot; (meaning not that bad boy), who makes up his own small story to explain why he didn't do his homework before his teacher Sandra Oh.  Ms. Oh is convinced at first, but the fib is discovered, and his parents don't like it, let alone being called by angry school teacher.Then, the real Big Fat Liar appears as Hollywood producer Paul Giamatti, the best reason for adults to see this film.  This Hollywood player, who desperately needs a hit, unashamedly steals the idea of Jason thought of as an essay to submit to his teacher, and this guy even tries to make a movie out of HIS idea.  Now Jason's got to do something to stop that.The film is always fast-paced, and because of the good healthy amount of visual gags and humor it is always interesting to see.  Some references to Hollywood names and the cameo of Lee Majors make the whole film lively.  And you also get a pretty funny John Woo parody.But the driving force of the film is Paul Giamatti.  His dedicated performance as a bit megalomaniac producer is much better than a simple caricature.  Giamatti shows unexpected flairs for slapsticks too, and his swimming pool scene (which makes him really blue) is just hilarious.Unlike Muniz and Giamatti, female characters seem relagated to thankless secondary roles.  Bynes is cute without being irritating, and you see equally cute Amanda Detmer as Giamatti's assistant, but they should have been given more chances to do something interesting.  I waited for them to do some funny thing, or deliver some good lines, but I didn't get them.Maybe you realize that no Hollywood producers would live in a house with this minimum security system, where kids can go in and out so freely.  And you know, one of Giamatti's friends seems to be Adam Sandler.  But if Sandler is your pal, you don't have to worry about making a hit movie.  But forget about these things, and let's see the comical actions of the film that never stops.",3,Entertaining Kids Movie with Superb Acting of Paul Giamatti,1063324800,"09 12, 2003",2003,2308,"['surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'kids', 'film', 'tradition', 'quot', 'Home', 'Alone', 'quot', 'stars', 'two', 'likable', 'kids', 'stars', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'Adults', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'lack', 'originality', 'still', 'admit', 'everything', 'done', 'good', 'pace.Of', 'course', 'kids', 'movie', 'Muniz', 'character', 'Jason', '14-year-old', 'Michigan', 'boy', 'fibber', 'not', 'quot', 'big', 'fat', 'liar', 'quot', 'meaning', 'not', 'bad', 'boy', 'who', 'up', 'own', 'small', 'story', 'explain', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'homework', 'teacher', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'Ms.', 'Oh', 'convinced', 'first', 'fib', 'discovered', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'let', 'alone', 'being', 'called', 'angry', 'school', 'teacher.Then', 'real', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'best', 'reason', 'adults', 'see', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'player', 'who', 'desperately', 'hit', 'unashamedly', 'idea', 'Jason', 'thought', 'essay', 'submit', 'teacher', 'guy', 'even', 'make', 'movie', 'HIS', 'idea', 'Now', 'Jason', 'got', 'do', 'something', 'stop', 'that.The', 'film', 'always', 'fast-paced', 'good', 'healthy', 'amount', 'visual', 'gags', 'humor', 'always', 'interesting', 'see', 'references', 'Hollywood', 'names', 'cameo', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'make', 'whole', 'film', 'lively', 'also', 'get', 'pretty', 'funny', 'John', 'Woo', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'dedicated', 'performance', 'bit', 'megalomaniac', 'producer', 'much', 'better', 'simple', 'caricature', 'Giamatti', 'unexpected', 'flairs', 'slapsticks', 'too', 'swimming', 'pool', 'scene', 'really', 'blue', 'just', 'hilarious.Unlike', 'Muniz', 'Giamatti', 'female', 'characters', 'seem', 'relagated', 'thankless', 'secondary', 'roles', 'Bynes', 'cute', 'being', 'irritating', 'see', 'equally', 'cute', 'Amanda', 'Detmer', 'Giamatti', 'assistant', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'chances', 'do', 'something', 'interesting', 'waited', 'do', 'funny', 'thing', 'deliver', 'good', 'lines', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'them.Maybe', 'realize', 'Hollywood', 'producers', 'would', 'live', 'house', 'minimum', 'security', 'system', 'where', 'kids', 'can', 'go', 'so', 'freely', 'know', 'one', 'Giamatti', 'friends', 'be', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Sandler', 'pal', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'making', 'hit', 'movie', 'forget', 'things', 'let', 'see', 'comical', 'actions', 'film', 'never']",N/A
