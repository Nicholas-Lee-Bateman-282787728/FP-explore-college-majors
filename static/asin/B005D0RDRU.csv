1454737,A14MOU9MF0NNVB,B005D0RDRU,"Angela ""Angel""","[0, 0]","Take note that the DVD jacket of this movie is very misleading in terms of the romantic aspect. The male characters on the box do not play the roles you might think they do. Regardless of the cover art, open the box and enjoy your time with this sweet holiday chick flick. Christmas has very little to do with the actual plot other than the fact that the movie is set during the Christmas season. Basically this is a story about a woman whose life is upset by unexpected change. She has to learn some lessons about herself and the people in her life - new and old relationships. Along the way, romance comes into the picture, even though she didn't want it to since she's been hurt before. There are some good laughs, very sweet lines quoted, tear-jerking moments and romance! I like it overall. And, have to add, the character of Dillon was yummy! I recommend this to anyone who wants a chick flick with a happy ending that takes place during winter/Christmas. It's worth the $7.",4,"Cute holiday romance, but the DVD photos are misleading",1329004800,"02 12, 2012",2012,980,"['Take', 'note', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'movie', 'very', 'misleading', 'terms', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'male', 'characters', 'box', 'do', 'not', 'play', 'roles', 'might', 'think', 'do', 'Regardless', 'cover', 'art', 'open', 'box', 'enjoy', 'time', 'sweet', 'holiday', 'chick', 'flick', 'Christmas', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'actual', 'plot', 'other', 'fact', 'movie', 'set', 'Christmas', 'season', 'Basically', 'story', 'woman', 'life', 'upset', 'unexpected', 'change', 'learn', 'lessons', 'people', 'life', 'new', 'old', 'relationships', 'way', 'romance', 'picture', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'been', 'hurt', 'are', 'good', 'laughs', 'very', 'sweet', 'lines', 'quoted', 'tear-jerking', 'moments', 'romance', 'overall', 'have', 'add', 'character', 'Dillon', 'was', 'yummy', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'chick', 'flick', 'happy', 'ending', 'place', 'winter/Christmas', '7']",A Very Merry Daughter Of The Bride
