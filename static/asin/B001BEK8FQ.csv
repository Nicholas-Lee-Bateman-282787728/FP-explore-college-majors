This time Gibney explores America's journey into darkness that is the so-called ""war on terror"" (BTW people, when you hear the words ""war on"" before anything you can bet it is a total disaster.). I was reminded of Nietzsche's warning and then of other lines from that great source of dark and enigmatic quotations...""Man is the cruelest animal."" ""Insanity in individuals is something rare - but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule."" But back to the first quote, I think the men that got us into this situation already were nihilistic, souless beasts and so hardly did much changing. What we should realize is that *they changed America.* I am well aware of America's ""mistakes"" and sins of the past but things are different now... and many of us feel it. On top of that -and more importantly- sadly many, all too many, of the people they chased after weren't monsters at all, but just people. Regular people in the wrong place at the wrong time.Take the story of ""a young rural Afghan cabdriver"", named Dilawar. Turned out he was falsely accused of helping to plan an attack on American troops. Dilawar was tortured for about two days and died. He is presented here as ""the first fatal victim of Vice President Dick Cheney's devotion to 'working the dark side'--torturing, humiliating, and otherwise abusing prisoners in the 'Global War on Terror.'"" We are told his story by the very soldiers that killed Dilwar, themselves shown to both tools and victims of the implementation of the Bush policy. And we hear from two New York Times investigative reporters who do a fine job of exposing this darker side of American power -- a darker side the New York Times I cannot help but remember helped in their ways to bring us to.-- Ohhh I hope you are aware of that?! You didn't forget did you? That drum beat for war was pounding so very loudly at the NYT. The name Judith Miller ring a bell? Well, she's just *one* of 'em. The whole mainstream media let us down and let us NEVER FORGET it. The film also details what methods are used in torturing prisoners: you won't ever let a right-winger or Rush Limbaugh ""Dittohead"" trivialize torture and Abu Graibh and the prsion camp at Guant&aacute;namo.Buy this or at least rent it and get others to see it too. While it is depressing it is fascinating to anyone with any interest in foreign policy and concern for our country and it's future. It is NOT to be dismissed as a mere anti-Republican, anti-Bush diatribe &agrave; la Michael Moore. This is an objective, sober documentary about a subject every American absolutely regardless of where they stand on the political spectrum should be in touch with and have intimate knowledge of. It is our business what our government does in our name and the blood is not only on their hands.",5,the horror,1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,3037,"['Be', 'careful', 'when', 'fight', 'monsters', 'lest', 'become', 'one', 'Friedrich', 'NietzscheWell', 'quote', 'came', 'mind', 'watched', 'depressing', '2007', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winner', 'directed', 'Alex', 'Gibney', 'ENRON', 'SMARTEST', 'GUYS', 'IN', 'THE', 'ROOM', '-also', 'excellent', 'time', 'Gibney', 'America', 'journey', 'darkness', 'so-called', 'war', 'terror', 'BTW', 'people', 'when', 'hear', 'words', 'war', 'anything', 'can', 'bet', 'total', 'disaster.', 'was', 'reminded', 'Nietzsche', 'warning', 'then', 'other', 'lines', 'great', 'source', 'dark', 'enigmatic', 'quotations', 'Man', 'cruelest', 'animal', 'Insanity', 'individuals', 'something', 'rare', 'groups', 'parties', 'nations', 'epochs', 'rule', 'back', 'first', 'quote', 'think', 'men', 'got', 'situation', 'already', 'were', 'nihilistic', 'souless', 'beasts', 'so', 'hardly', 'did', 'much', 'changing', 'What', 'should', 'realize', '*they', 'changed', 'America', '*', 'am', 'well', 'aware', 'America', 'mistakes', 'sins', 'past', 'things', 'are', 'different', 'now', 'many', 'feel', 'top', '-and', 'more', 'importantly-', 'sadly', 'many', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'chased', 'were', ""n't"", 'monsters', 'just', 'people', 'Regular', 'people', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time.Take', 'story', 'young', 'rural', 'Afghan', 'cabdriver', 'named', 'Dilawar', 'Turned', 'out', 'was', 'falsely', 'accused', 'helping', 'plan', 'attack', 'American', 'troops', 'Dilawar', 'was', 'tortured', 'about', 'two', 'days', 'died', 'presented', 'here', 'first', 'fatal', 'victim', 'Vice', 'President', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'devotion', ""'working"", 'dark', 'side', 'torturing', 'humiliating', 'otherwise', 'abusing', 'prisoners', ""'Global"", 'War', 'Terror', 'are', 'told', 'story', 'very', 'soldiers', 'killed', 'Dilwar', 'shown', 'tools', 'victims', 'implementation', 'Bush', 'policy', 'hear', 'two', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'investigative', 'reporters', 'who', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'exposing', 'darker', 'side', 'American', 'power', 'darker', 'side', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'remember', 'helped', 'ways', 'bring', 'to.', 'Ohhh', 'hope', 'are', 'aware', 'did', ""n't"", 'forget', 'did', 'beat', 'war', 'was', 'pounding', 'so', 'very', 'loudly', 'NYT', 'name', 'Judith', 'Miller', 'ring', 'bell', 'Well', 'just', '*one*', 'whole', 'mainstream', 'media', 'let', 'down', 'let', 'NEVER', 'FORGET', 'film', 'also', 'details', 'what', 'methods', 'are', 'used', 'torturing', 'prisoners', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'let', 'right-winger', 'Rush', 'Limbaugh', 'Dittohead', 'trivialize', 'torture', 'Abu', 'Graibh', 'prsion', 'camp', 'Guant', 'aacute', 'least', 'rent', 'get', 'others', 'see', 'too', 'depressing', 'fascinating', 'anyone', 'interest', 'foreign', 'policy', 'concern', 'country', 'future', 'NOT', 'be', 'dismissed', 'mere', 'anti-Republican', 'anti-Bush', 'diatribe', 'agrave', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'objective', 'sober', 'documentary', 'subject', 'American', 'absolutely', 'regardless', 'where', 'stand', 'political', 'spectrum', 'should', 'be', 'touch', 'have', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'business', 'what', 'government', 'name', 'blood', 'not', 'only', 'hands']",Taxi To the Dark Side

Starting with the case of Dilawar, a taxi driver from Afghanistan, the documentary traces the lives of terrorist suspects imprisoned in Bagram in Afghanistan; Abu Graib in Iraq, and Guantanamo Bay, in Cuba.  Showing ample evidence of beatings and abuse, the film has several photographs and much testimony with which to work.Among the interviewees are some of the suspects who were either court marshaled or imprisoned for their offenses when the scandal became public.  Pfc. Damien Corsetti, Sgt. Ken Davies, and Pfc. Willie Brand, among many others, testify about their roles and interrogation methods with the detainees.  Effectively, the film makes connections with memos and other evidence to show that there was pressure for these subordinates to take ""any means possible"" to provide intelligence.Before viewing the documentary, the news revealed some of the tactics of allegedly ""a few bad apples"".  The use of mean dogs, long seclusion, handcuffs while shackling, beatings, and waterboarding are some of the methods recounted here.  The movie also chronicles the brutal deaths of some of the inmates at these facilities.The film also reveals that only about 7% of detainees were captured by U.S. forces, and many Pakistanis and Afghanis were given large money rewards for the capture of alleged terrorists.  Between these pressures and some of the words of Former Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and Vice President, Dick Cheney, the documentary makes a compelling case about a ""mean, nasty business"" where weasel words like what's done in prison is in ""the eye of the beholder"" were used.While I would still like to see a documentary that investigates the beheadings of allies, `Taxi to the Dark Side' presents poignant testimony for matters that went wrong.  One of the best testimonies is by writer/director, Alex Gibney's father, Frank B.Gibney, a former navy interrogator, who said in regard to our conduct during war before 9/11, ""It was what made America different.""  Much of the scandal was unveiled by New York Times investigative reporter, Tim Golden, yet some of the most convincing moments come from the life and senate questioning of Senator John McCain, who gives an authoritative presence to an unflinching film with a convincing composite.Do the ends justify the means?  `Taxi to the Dark Side' makes enough of a case where everyone will be forced to come up with an answer.('Taxi to the Dark Side' is the most recent Best Documentary Oscar winner.)",5,"""God Mend Thy Every Flaw""/""Do the Ends Justify the Means?""",1222992000,"10 3, 2008",2008,2519,"['Taxi', 'Dark', 'Side', 'eye-opener', 'Starting', 'case', 'Dilawar', 'taxi', 'driver', 'Afghanistan', 'documentary', 'traces', 'lives', 'terrorist', 'suspects', 'imprisoned', 'Bagram', 'Afghanistan', 'Abu', 'Graib', 'Iraq', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'Cuba', 'Showing', 'ample', 'evidence', 'beatings', 'abuse', 'film', 'several', 'photographs', 'much', 'testimony', 'work.Among', 'interviewees', 'are', 'suspects', 'who', 'were', 'court', 'marshaled', 'imprisoned', 'offenses', 'when', 'scandal', 'became', 'public', 'Pfc', 'Damien', 'Corsetti', 'Sgt', 'Ken', 'Davies', 'Pfc', 'Willie', 'Brand', 'many', 'others', 'testify', 'roles', 'interrogation', 'methods', 'detainees', 'Effectively', 'film', 'connections', 'memos', 'other', 'evidence', 'show', 'was', 'pressure', 'subordinates', 'take', 'means', 'possible', 'provide', 'intelligence.Before', 'viewing', 'documentary', 'news', 'revealed', 'tactics', 'allegedly', 'few', 'bad', 'apples', 'use', 'mean', 'dogs', 'long', 'seclusion', 'handcuffs', 'shackling', 'beatings', 'waterboarding', 'are', 'methods', 'recounted', 'here', 'movie', 'also', 'brutal', 'deaths', 'inmates', 'facilities.The', 'film', 'also', 'only', 'about', '7', '%', 'detainees', 'were', 'captured', 'U.S.', 'forces', 'many', 'Pakistanis', 'Afghanis', 'were', 'given', 'large', 'money', 'rewards', 'capture', 'alleged', 'terrorists', 'pressures', 'words', 'Former', 'Defense', 'Secretary', 'Donald', 'Rumsfeld', 'Vice', 'President', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'documentary', 'compelling', 'case', 'mean', 'nasty', 'business', 'where', 'weasel', 'words', 'what', 'done', 'prison', 'eye', 'beholder', 'were', 'used.While', 'would', 'still', 'like', 'see', 'documentary', 'beheadings', 'allies', 'Taxi', 'Dark', 'Side', 'presents', 'poignant', 'testimony', 'matters', 'went', 'wrong', 'One', 'best', 'testimonies', 'writer/director', 'Alex', 'Gibney', 'father', 'Frank', 'B.Gibney', 'former', 'navy', 'interrogator', 'who', 'said', 'regard', 'conduct', 'war', '9/11', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'America', 'different', 'Much', 'scandal', 'was', 'unveiled', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'Tim', 'Golden', 'yet', 'most', 'convincing', 'moments', 'come', 'life', 'senate', 'questioning', 'Senator', 'John', 'McCain', 'who', 'authoritative', 'presence', 'unflinching', 'film', 'convincing', 'composite.Do', 'ends', 'justify', 'means', 'Taxi', 'Dark', 'Side', 'enough', 'case', 'where', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'come', 'up', 'answer', ""'Taxi"", 'Dark', 'Side', 'most', 'recent', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'Oscar', 'winner']",Taxi To the Dark Side
1171967,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001BEK8FQ,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 3]","I often complain about the lopsidedness of documentaries. And more often than not, whenever I mention this, people pepper me with insults because they believe ""that's what documentaries are designed to do."" I beg to differ. Let me show you what I mean.There are some seriously stilted documentaries that look at one side (and ONLY one side) of an issue and never give credence to the other. How about an interview with someone who opposes the views that the documentarians are putting forth? How about some information that might refute what is being told? This one-sidedness is just too easy to find. Things likeAfter Innocence,The Future of Food, andReligulousare prime examples (there are tons more but I don't have the time nor inclination to mention them).Occasionally - if not extremely rarely - a documentary will come along that allows both sides to speak. And such is the case with the Academy Award winner TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE.The story starts and ends with the murder of Dilawar, a taxi cab driver in Afghanistan who is mistakenly picked up by U.S. forces and sent to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for interrogation. Once there, he soon dies from injuries sustained at the hands of his captors. The middle of this documentary is the meat and potatoes of what went horribly wrong with the U.S.'s war on terror. It's a serious eye-opener. Not because it focuses on the problems the U.S. had with its detainees after 9/11, but because it allows everyone to speak about the successes and failures of torture. Yes, torture.From the men on the ground (staff sergeants and privates) to the President's advisory attorney at the U.S. Dept. of Justice (John Woo), we get to hear from just about everyone on the topic of the incarcerated detainees and their treatment at the hands of untrained and unprepared interrogators. It is astonishing, too, to learn that not a single person above the rank of sergeant was punished for the death of Dilawar (nor any other detainee who was abused). You mean to tell me that these grunts were responsible for ...everything? Give me a break!I don't delude myself any longer. The U.S. (either overtly or covertly) now uses ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" (e.g. torture). Make no doubt about it. We do it because we want to protect ourselves. But at what cost to our own moral compass? We claim to follow The Geneva Convention, but do we? Not as far as I can tell. And don't take my word for it. Watch ALL of the people in this documentary talk about this very subject and come to your own conclusions.",5,Exceptional Documentary That Focuses On Everyone Involved Post 9/11,1243987200,"06 3, 2009",2009,2533,"['often', 'complain', 'lopsidedness', 'documentaries', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'whenever', 'mention', 'people', 'insults', 'believe', 'what', 'documentaries', 'are', 'designed', 'do', 'beg', 'differ', 'Let', 'show', 'what', 'are', 'seriously', 'stilted', 'documentaries', 'look', 'one', 'side', 'ONLY', 'one', 'side', 'issue', 'never', 'give', 'credence', 'other', 'How', 'interview', 'someone', 'who', 'views', 'documentarians', 'are', 'putting', 'forth', 'How', 'information', 'might', 'refute', 'what', 'being', 'told', 'one-sidedness', 'just', 'too', 'easy', 'find', 'Things', 'likeAfter', 'Innocence', 'Future', 'Food', 'andReligulousare', 'prime', 'examples', 'are', 'tons', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'inclination', 'mention', '.Occasionally', 'not', 'extremely', 'rarely', 'documentary', 'will', 'come', 'sides', 'speak', 'such', 'case', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'TAXI', 'TO', 'THE', 'DARK', 'SIDE.The', 'story', 'starts', 'murder', 'Dilawar', 'taxi', 'cab', 'driver', 'Afghanistan', 'who', 'mistakenly', 'picked', 'up', 'U.S.', 'forces', 'sent', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'Cuba', 'interrogation', 'Once', 'there', 'soon', 'injuries', 'sustained', 'hands', 'captors', 'middle', 'documentary', 'meat', 'potatoes', 'what', 'went', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'U.S.', 'war', 'terror', 'serious', 'eye-opener', 'Not', 'problems', 'U.S.', 'had', 'detainees', '9/11', 'everyone', 'speak', 'successes', 'failures', 'torture', 'Yes', 'men', 'ground', 'staff', 'sergeants', 'privates', 'President', 'advisory', 'attorney', 'U.S.', 'Dept', 'Justice', 'John', 'Woo', 'get', 'hear', 'just', 'everyone', 'topic', 'incarcerated', 'detainees', 'treatment', 'hands', 'untrained', 'unprepared', 'interrogators', 'astonishing', 'too', 'learn', 'not', 'single', 'person', 'rank', 'sergeant', 'was', 'punished', 'death', 'Dilawar', 'other', 'detainee', 'who', 'was', 'abused', 'mean', 'tell', 'grunts', 'were', 'responsible', 'everything', 'Give', 'break', 'do', ""n't"", 'delude', 'longer', 'U.S.', 'overtly', 'covertly', 'now', 'enhanced', 'interrogation', 'techniques', 'e.g', 'torture', 'Make', 'doubt', 'do', 'want', 'protect', 'what', 'cost', 'own', 'moral', 'compass', 'claim', 'follow', 'Geneva', 'Convention', 'do', 'Not', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'word', 'Watch', 'people', 'documentary', 'talk', 'very', 'subject', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions']",Taxi To the Dark Side
1171968,A33TDRCKKOFB15,B001BEK8FQ,Brian Covert,"[0, 0]","Finally! -- a documentary that makes no excuses for the behavior of U.S. military personnel in torturing people and which puts the so-called ""war on terrorism"" into a much clearer perspective for viewers worldwide.As the title of this documentary implies, this is a dark (and often depressing) film. The torture-induced homicide of Dilawar, an innocent Afghan taxi driver, by U.S. military forces in Afghanistan serves as the focus of the movie, which then goes on to explore the U.S. torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The common thread of torture as an officially permitted policy of the former Bush administration links these three internationally condemned prisons, and through the film's narrative, director Alex Gibney does a good job of holding both lower-ranking and higher-ranking U.S. military people accountable.This point was a major weakeness of another movie on the subject, ""Ghosts of Abu Ghraib"" by filmmaker Rory Kennedy of the politically powerful Kennedy clan. Rory Kennedy's film (correctly) puts the blame for torture on the Bush administration and U.S. military brass -- yet the director herself describes the lower-ranking U.S. soldiers involved in torture at Abu Ghraib as quote-unquote ""sweet"" and ""likable"" young persons. This kind of liberal thinking comes across as not only condescending but also downright insulting to the morals of decent people around the world.Fortunately, director Gibney seems to have learned well from Kennedy's mistakes and has made what is, in my opinion, the best documentary on this subject so far. Apparently the elite of Hollywood thought so too, for ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" won an Academy Award in 2007 for best documentary feature. Very unusual, yes, but understandable when you watch this film and see how well it is edited and produced.The movie is divided into chapter subtitles on the screen, making it easier for viewers to follow a plot that can get complicated at times. I also liked the use of graphics and music -- and especially the lack of humor that you would find in, say, a Michael Moore movie on the same subject. ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" stays serious from beginning to end, yet manages to inform and educate without preaching to the choir.The part of the movie that I found most enraging was the sheer arrogance of some U.S. military personnel, as characterized in the comments by U.S. Army Sgt. Thomas Curtis, an MP at the Bagram  base, in explaining why he did not step in and stop the torture of the Afghan taxi driver, Dilawar, before he was killed in U.S. custody. Curtis says in the film, quote: ""It was us against them. I was over there, I didn't want to appear to be going against my fellow soldiers. Is that wrong? You could sit here and say that was dead wrong. Go over there [to Afghanistan] and say that.""My response to Sgt. Curtis and any others like him would be simply this: You and your fellow soldiers were *all* wrong -- dead wrong, literally -- regardless of where that homicide took place. By not appearing to go against your fellow soldiers, you indeed saved their face and yours....but in the process, you went against the norms of all civilized people everywhere who hold higher moral values than that. Take responsibility for that, sergeant, and feel ashamed.Beyond that, I highly commend director Alex Gibney for standing up and making a film that is not afraid to place the responsibility where it really lies: in the conscience of every U.S. citizen. A dark and depressing movie it is, but that is only because the so-called ""war on terror"" itself is dark. By shedding some light on the dark side, Gibney and his staff have indeed done a great service to us all.If there was any weakness in this movie, I think it would be that the focus was on interviews with U.S. military insiders. That is fine, but I would have liked to have seen more interviews with former prisoners than just the one interview conducted with Moazzam Begg, a British citizen who was unjustly imprisoned at Afghanistan (at the same time as Dilawar, the taxi driver) and later at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But so powerful is Begg's testimony in this film that such a weakness could easily be overlooked in following the much bigger picture.Now, with this excellent film having been made, the next logical step would be to link the recent cases of U.S. military torture of brown-skinned people overseas to the longtime, routine torture of brown-skinned people within the vast domestic prison system of the United States. Any takers out there among filmmakers to produce a documentary that directly links Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay to the U.S. jail system and U.S. prison-industrial complex?",5,'Dead Wrong' -- Literally,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,4714,"['Finally', 'documentary', 'excuses', 'behavior', 'U.S.', 'military', 'personnel', 'torturing', 'people', 'so-called', 'war', 'terrorism', 'much', 'clearer', 'perspective', 'viewers', 'worldwide.As', 'title', 'documentary', 'implies', 'dark', 'often', 'depressing', 'film', 'torture-induced', 'homicide', 'Dilawar', 'innocent', 'Afghan', 'taxi', 'driver', 'U.S.', 'military', 'forces', 'Afghanistan', 'serves', 'focus', 'movie', 'then', 'explore', 'U.S.', 'torture', 'prisoners', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'prison', 'Iraq', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'Cuba', 'common', 'thread', 'torture', 'officially', 'permitted', 'policy', 'former', 'Bush', 'administration', 'three', 'internationally', 'condemned', 'prisons', 'film', 'narrative', 'director', 'Alex', 'Gibney', 'good', 'job', 'holding', 'lower-ranking', 'higher-ranking', 'U.S.', 'military', 'people', 'accountable.This', 'point', 'was', 'major', 'weakeness', 'movie', 'subject', 'Ghosts', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'filmmaker', 'Rory', 'Kennedy', 'politically', 'powerful', 'Kennedy', 'clan', 'Rory', 'Kennedy', 'film', 'correctly', 'blame', 'torture', 'Bush', 'administration', 'U.S.', 'military', 'brass', 'yet', 'director', 'lower-ranking', 'U.S.', 'soldiers', 'involved', 'torture', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'quote-unquote', 'sweet', 'likable', 'young', 'persons', 'kind', 'liberal', 'thinking', 'across', 'not', 'only', 'condescending', 'also', 'downright', 'insulting', 'morals', 'decent', 'people', 'world.Fortunately', 'director', 'Gibney', 'have', 'learned', 'well', 'Kennedy', 'mistakes', 'made', 'what', 'opinion', 'best', 'documentary', 'subject', 'so', 'far', 'Apparently', 'elite', 'Hollywood', 'thought', 'so', 'too', 'Taxi', 'Dark', 'Side', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', '2007', 'best', 'documentary', 'feature', 'Very', 'unusual', 'yes', 'understandable', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'edited', 'produced.The', 'movie', 'divided', 'chapter', 'subtitles', 'screen', 'making', 'easier', 'viewers', 'follow', 'plot', 'can', 'get', 'complicated', 'times', 'also', 'liked', 'use', 'graphics', 'music', 'especially', 'lack', 'humor', 'would', 'find', 'say', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'movie', 'same', 'subject', 'Taxi', 'Dark', 'Side', 'serious', 'beginning', 'end', 'yet', 'inform', 'educate', 'preaching', 'choir.The', 'part', 'movie', 'found', 'most', 'enraging', 'was', 'sheer', 'arrogance', 'U.S.', 'military', 'personnel', 'characterized', 'comments', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Sgt', 'Thomas', 'Curtis', 'MP', 'Bagram', 'base', 'explaining', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'step', 'stop', 'torture', 'Afghan', 'taxi', 'driver', 'Dilawar', 'was', 'killed', 'U.S.', 'custody', 'Curtis', 'film', 'quote', 'was', 'was', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'appear', 'be', 'going', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'wrong', 'could', 'sit', 'here', 'say', 'was', 'dead', 'wrong', 'Go', 'there', '[', 'Afghanistan', ']', 'say', 'response', 'Sgt', 'Curtis', 'others', 'would', 'be', 'simply', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'were', '*all*', 'wrong', 'dead', 'wrong', 'literally', 'regardless', 'where', 'homicide', 'took', 'place', 'not', 'appearing', 'go', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'indeed', 'saved', 'face', 'yours', '.but', 'process', 'went', 'norms', 'civilized', 'people', 'everywhere', 'who', 'hold', 'higher', 'moral', 'values', 'Take', 'responsibility', 'sergeant', 'feel', 'ashamed.Beyond', 'highly', 'commend', 'director', 'Alex', 'Gibney', 'standing', 'up', 'making', 'film', 'not', 'afraid', 'place', 'responsibility', 'where', 'really', 'conscience', 'U.S.', 'citizen', 'dark', 'depressing', 'movie', 'only', 'so-called', 'war', 'terror', 'dark', 'shedding', 'light', 'dark', 'side', 'Gibney', 'staff', 'have', 'indeed', 'done', 'great', 'service', 'all.If', 'was', 'weakness', 'movie', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'focus', 'was', 'interviews', 'U.S.', 'military', 'insiders', 'fine', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'interviews', 'former', 'prisoners', 'just', 'one', 'interview', 'conducted', 'Moazzam', 'Begg', 'British', 'citizen', 'who', 'was', 'unjustly', 'imprisoned', 'Afghanistan', 'same', 'time', 'Dilawar', 'taxi', 'driver', 'later', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'Cuba', 'so', 'powerful', 'Begg', 'testimony', 'film', 'weakness', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'overlooked', 'following', 'much', 'bigger', 'picture.Now', 'excellent', 'film', 'having', 'been', 'made', 'next', 'logical', 'step', 'would', 'be', 'link', 'recent', 'cases', 'U.S.', 'military', 'torture', 'brown-skinned', 'people', 'overseas', 'longtime', 'routine', 'torture', 'brown-skinned', 'people', 'vast', 'domestic', 'prison', 'system', 'United', 'States', 'takers', 'there', 'filmmakers', 'produce', 'documentary', 'directly', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'U.S.', 'jail', 'system', 'U.S.', 'prison-industrial', 'complex']",Taxi To the Dark Side
1171969,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B001BEK8FQ,Chris Luallen,"[40, 43]","With this extraordinary film director Alex Gibney makes a convincing and well researched case against the acts of torture, abuse and humiliation committed by the U.S. military against political prisoners in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay.A major sub-plot is the story of Dilawar, an Afghan taxi driver who ended up dying from injuries suffered while he was held in Bagram, a former Soviet prison coverted into a U.S. detention center for suspected terroists. However, the film explains how Dilawar was actually an innocent man turned in by an actual terroist seeking to throw investigators off his trail. One expert explains how only about 1% of the detainees are actual terroists and that the vast majority were not even arrested by the U.S. military. But rather were turned in by Pakastani and Afghani bounty hunters seeking financial compensation.The numerous forms of abuse inflicted on these foreign detainees is depicted in gruesome detail. The methods of torture included not only water boarding but various means of sexual humiliation such as having women's panties placed on their heads, forced masturbation and female military officers caressing them while whispering ""your mother is a whore"" into their ears. The ultimate goal was inflicting a complete mental, physical and emotional breakdown on the prisoners. Other tactics used were sleep depravation achieved by handcuffing detainees to the ceiling for days at a time and the sort of brutal physical assaults that led to the death of the innocent Dilawar.Of course, it was the low ranking soldiers who ended up facing punishment when these acts of illegal abuse were discovered. But the film makes it very clear that they were simply following orders handed down from the highest levels of the Bush administration. Particularly at fault were chicken hawks Cheney and Rumsfield. In fact, it was Cheney himself who gave this doc its title when he referred to how the U.S. must go over to the ""dark side"" in its military and intelligence methods.The film concludes with a powerful statement from the director's father Frank Gibney. He describes how, as an military interrogator in World War II and the Korean War, he and other officers were required to follow a strict code of conduct that respected the human rights of prisoners. But with this new ""dark side' policy the U.S. miltary is instead following the tactics of the Communists, Fascists and even the Spanish Inquistion. They are not only ignoring the rules laid down by the Geneva Convention,  but even the U.S. Constitution itself - which guarantees all prisoners the right to counsel and a speedy trial. These ""dark side"" tactics are not those of the United States of America that I love and believe in. Instead they are those of politicians lacking a moral compass which all Americans of conscience, liberal and conservative, should be ashamed of.",5,Outstanding Documentary About The Methods Of Torture Being Used By The U.S. Military,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,2877,"['extraordinary', 'film', 'director', 'Alex', 'Gibney', 'convincing', 'well', 'researched', 'case', 'acts', 'torture', 'abuse', 'humiliation', 'committed', 'U.S.', 'military', 'political', 'prisoners', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay.A', 'major', 'sub-plot', 'story', 'Dilawar', 'Afghan', 'taxi', 'driver', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'dying', 'injuries', 'suffered', 'was', 'held', 'Bagram', 'former', 'Soviet', 'prison', 'coverted', 'U.S.', 'detention', 'center', 'suspected', 'terroists', 'However', 'film', 'how', 'Dilawar', 'was', 'actually', 'innocent', 'man', 'turned', 'actual', 'terroist', 'seeking', 'throw', 'investigators', 'trail', 'One', 'expert', 'how', 'only', 'about', '1', '%', 'detainees', 'are', 'actual', 'terroists', 'vast', 'majority', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'arrested', 'U.S.', 'military', 'rather', 'were', 'turned', 'Pakastani', 'Afghani', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'seeking', 'financial', 'compensation.The', 'numerous', 'forms', 'abuse', 'inflicted', 'foreign', 'detainees', 'depicted', 'gruesome', 'detail', 'methods', 'torture', 'included', 'not', 'only', 'water', 'boarding', 'various', 'means', 'sexual', 'humiliation', 'such', 'having', 'women', 'panties', 'placed', 'heads', 'forced', 'masturbation', 'female', 'military', 'officers', 'caressing', 'whispering', 'mother', 'whore', 'ears', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'was', 'inflicting', 'complete', 'mental', 'physical', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'prisoners', 'Other', 'tactics', 'used', 'were', 'sleep', 'depravation', 'achieved', 'handcuffing', 'detainees', 'ceiling', 'days', 'time', 'sort', 'brutal', 'physical', 'assaults', 'led', 'death', 'innocent', 'Dilawar.Of', 'course', 'was', 'low', 'ranking', 'soldiers', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'facing', 'punishment', 'when', 'acts', 'illegal', 'abuse', 'were', 'discovered', 'film', 'very', 'clear', 'were', 'simply', 'following', 'orders', 'handed', 'down', 'highest', 'levels', 'Bush', 'administration', 'Particularly', 'fault', 'were', 'chicken', 'hawks', 'Cheney', 'Rumsfield', 'fact', 'was', 'Cheney', 'who', 'gave', 'doc', 'title', 'when', 'referred', 'how', 'U.S.', 'must', 'go', 'dark', 'side', 'military', 'intelligence', 'methods.The', 'film', 'powerful', 'statement', 'director', 'father', 'Frank', 'Gibney', 'how', 'military', 'interrogator', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Korean', 'War', 'other', 'officers', 'were', 'required', 'follow', 'strict', 'code', 'conduct', 'respected', 'human', 'rights', 'prisoners', 'new', 'dark', 'side', 'policy', 'U.S.', 'miltary', 'instead', 'following', 'tactics', 'Communists', 'Fascists', 'even', 'Spanish', 'Inquistion', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'ignoring', 'rules', 'laid', 'down', 'Geneva', 'Convention', 'even', 'U.S.', 'Constitution', 'prisoners', 'right', 'counsel', 'speedy', 'trial', 'dark', 'side', 'tactics', 'are', 'not', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'love', 'believe', 'Instead', 'are', 'politicians', 'lacking', 'moral', 'compass', 'Americans', 'conscience', 'liberal', 'conservative', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed']",Taxi To the Dark Side
1171970,AQ990HW13DP08,B001BEK8FQ,Daniel B. Clendenin,"[1, 1]","On December 5, 2002, an Afghan taxi driver named Diliwar was taken to America's prison at the Bagram Air Force Base. Five days later he was dead. At first the military said that he had died of ""natural causes,"" but in a later inquiry the coroner testified that his lower body had been ""pulpified."" On his death certificate issued by the military the box marked ""homicide"" was checked. Taxi to the Dark Side won an Academy Award as best documentary for portraying detainee abuse and torture at Bagram, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo. There are at least 83,000 detainees in US custody; over 108 of them have died, at least 37 by homicide. The film combines interviews with the military police who interrogated Diliwar, genuine heroes in this sordid story like Alberto Mora (General Counsel to the Navy 2001-2006), grotesque still photos that shock the conscience, justifications of the abuse by John Yoo, and commentary by investigative reporters and attorneys.

1171972,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B001BEK8FQ,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[2, 3]","In early December 2002, a young Afghani named Dilawar picked up three passengers destined for his hometown, but he never made it there, and he never saw his family again. He was rounded up in a sweep by the US military and incarcerated in Bagram Prison where he was designated as a PUC, or person under control. Deprived of sleep and shackled to an overhang, which prevented him from falling asleep because of the pressure it would put on one's wrists, he began crying out for his mother and father. American soldiers tried to shut him up by kicking him with their knees to the fleshy part of his thighs. Every one of them got their ""kicks"" and Dalawar died in custody, the second man in as many weeks. He weighed 122 lbs at the time of his death. The coroner listed his death as a homicide. She would later testify that his legs had been ""pulpified."" They would have had to have been amputated had he survived. His family was given his body and a death certificate--in English.Dilawar is the beginning story of this fascinating video about an American policy of torture that has taken place in Afghanistan, Abu Ghraib in Iraq, and at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay. I kept watching this sickening story over and over again with the disbelief that Americans could institute cruelty as evil as what Nazis, Japanese, and Koreans had perpetrated against us and our allies, evils that we have executed past tormentors for.The enlisted personnel involved make it clear, usually in their own words, that the beatings, deaths in custody, and torture were not random acts of rogue sadists men who decided to act on their own. They were encouraged to torture and humiliate with the tacit approval of their command and from Washington D. C. to commit these acts.As the video shows, it begins with Dick Cheney, telling Tim Russert on ""Meet the Press"" that we [Americans] have to turn to the dark side to gather in intelligence in the same manner that our enemies do, and do whatever it takes to get it. This televised interview takes place one week after 9/11.Next, Alberto Gonzalez writes a policy declaring Afghanistan a failed state. Therefore, he concludes, Article III of the Geneva Conventions does not apply. Anyone taken into custody will not be treated as a prisoner of war.Mild-mannered John Yoo of the Justice Department belies his soft-spoken nature by doing the rest. He writes an opinion for the White House that states torture can only occur if it results in organ failure or death. (The only problem is that it is too late to realize that you have tortured someone if you achieve one or the other). But, Yoo goes further offering another opinion that the President of the United States can do virtually anything he wants, and it will not be outside the law.Donald Rumsfeld joins in with a memorandum in which he pens, ""What's wrong with standing 4 hours? I stand 10-12 hours a day."" This means the gloves are off, and officers and enlisted men who seek guidance on what limits they have are never given any. They are told to get actionable intelligence, and get it fast. The torture begins.Detainees are stripped naked upon arrival, given cavity searches, and disoriented by darkness and loud sounds. They are then put into isolation and deprived of sleep. (The sleep deprivation boards that list how much time to let a detainee sleep or how long to keep him awake will be removed during International Red Cross inspections). Some will be beaten or water-boarded. The latter makes the victim feel he is suffocating through drowning. And as studies in the 1950s had shown, depriving a person of stimuli, visual and auditory could induce psychosis in as little as two days. Visiting generals and SecDef, Donald Rumsfeld compliment the staff on the fine job they are doing.Policy is based upon a belief that such treatment will startle the victim into talking, and he will tell the truth. This is tried with one victim who states Saddam Hussein is acquiring nuclear weapons, and that there is a connection between Saddam and Osama bin-Laden, information he is prodded to give through waterboarding. His ""confession"" will be rushed to the White House and to Colin Powell, in time for his speech before the United Nations. It will become further proof that torture does not provide accurate information.In Hamden v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme Court writes an opinion of outrage declaring that Americans are entitled to habeas corpus and detainees must be accorded the status of Prisoners of War. President Bush is furious. He quotes the Geneva Convention: ""'...outrages upon human dignity.' That's vague! What does that mean?""While the Supreme Court thwarts George Bush and Dick Cheney, they are still capable of playing the scoundrels. They threaten to withhold the support of the conservative base of the Republican party from John McCain in his presidential bid, unless he supports the Military Commission Act of 2006. This law bypasses the Supreme Court decision by allowing the accused to have their trials, but they will not be released from custody unless the White House says so. There is also a provision that pardons the President, the Vice President, Rumsfeld and a number of generals from prosecution for torture. It does not include enlisted men.More than a dozen investigations begin with all them aiming downward, not one officer is convicted by a court martial. Instead of the President following the recommendation that Major General Miller be disciplined for bringing his Guantanamo style of incarceration to Abu-Ghraib, he is awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and retires.Our military picked up seven percent of the detainees. Ninety-three percent were turned over to the US by forces of the Northern Alliance, Pakistan, or from neighbors who were eager to get the $5,000 bounty that the US government was offering. This also allowed the snitch to take over the neighbor's farm or poppy crop. There have been 87,000 detainees in American custody. Not one of them has been brought to trial.The Northern Alliance guard who turned in Dilawar, the taxi driver was himself later brought to custody for having directed fire against US bases, and for having turned in innocent victims after each attack.This DVD should not be missed. It will command your attention. It should be burned into your memory forever. It should serve as a reminder that being American does not exclude one from becoming a Nazi, and if we don't hold our leaders accountable, we are no different than they are.In twelve more days and a wake-up we should start finding more answers.This is dedicated to Army Specialist Joseph M. Darby for having had the guts to act like a true soldier.ALSO RECOMMENDED:Mayer, Jane, ""The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals,"" Doubleday, 2008Hurwitz, Tom, ""The Ghosts of Abu-Ghraib,"" DVDMiles, Steven, M.

Karasik,"[1, 1]","Taking as its example an innocent taxi driver who was arrested, tortured and murdered at Bagram Prison pursuant to a widespread and unreliable method of detaining suspects by offering financial incentives to local warlords, this careful and thorough documentary clearly connects the dots to explain how America has stripped 83,000 detainees of their freedom and human rights in the name of protecting the same freedom and rights of Americans.  The film makes an extremely cogent argument that the Cheney/Bush Administration philosophy of torture is unjustified under both moral or pragmatic grounds, and that the legacy of abuses committed at Bagram, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo Bay Prisons is not only immoral but counter-productive.  Equally outrageous is that the lower level military personnel who perpetrated these frimes were court-martialed, while the top government officials (including most notably Cheney and Rumsfeld) who instituted and defended these tactics were never held accountable.  If the vast resources America has spent detaining and torturing prisoners had instead been spent improving the conditions for war-stricken Muslim villages, we might have actually made some progress in the ill-conceived ""war on terror"".",5,Incredibly important film,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,1235,"['Taking', 'example', 'innocent', 'taxi', 'driver', 'who', 'was', 'arrested', 'tortured', 'murdered', 'Bagram', 'Prison', 'pursuant', 'widespread', 'unreliable', 'method', 'detaining', 'suspects', 'offering', 'financial', 'incentives', 'local', 'warlords', 'careful', 'thorough', 'documentary', 'clearly', 'dots', 'explain', 'how', 'America', 'stripped', '83,000', 'detainees', 'freedom', 'human', 'rights', 'name', 'protecting', 'same', 'freedom', 'rights', 'Americans', 'film', 'extremely', 'cogent', 'argument', 'Cheney/Bush', 'Administration', 'philosophy', 'torture', 'unjustified', 'moral', 'pragmatic', 'grounds', 'legacy', 'abuses', 'committed', 'Bagram', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'Prisons', 'not', 'only', 'immoral', 'counter-productive', 'Equally', 'outrageous', 'lower', 'level', 'military', 'personnel', 'who', 'perpetrated', 'frimes', 'were', 'court-martialed', 'top', 'government', 'officials', 'including', 'most', 'notably', 'Cheney', 'Rumsfeld', 'who', 'instituted', 'defended', 'tactics', 'were', 'never', 'held', 'accountable', 'vast', 'resources', 'America', 'spent', 'detaining', 'torturing', 'prisoners', 'had', 'instead', 'been', 'spent', 'improving', 'conditions', 'war-stricken', 'Muslim', 'villages', 'might', 'have', 'actually', 'made', 'progress', 'ill-conceived', 'war', 'terror']",Taxi To the Dark Side
1171974,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B001BEK8FQ,Howard M. Kindel,"[1, 1]","Yes, the torture depicted in this film is an embarrassment and a possible war crime.  Yes, the Administration under whose auspices it occurred seems to relish secrecy above all else.  And yet, one has to wonder if perhaps there was a reason to let it be revealed which overrode all the reasons for keeping it hidden.  Namely, to de-sensitize the American public to the very idea of torture.  The fact that as much as 40% of the American people ""approve"" of torture is not a statistic to be taken lightly.  And now the people have seen it in action, not merely read about it in news reports.  The simple truth is, torture will be easier, not harder, to get away with the next time around - because the precedent has been set and now people are beginning to get used to the idea of it.  Each of the former soldiers interviewed (many of whom are or have been on trial) expressed great remorse; but at the time they were executing the torture, their focus was only on doing their duty, not questioning it.  The most telling (and most chilling) piece of these soldiers' story was that they each took a turn at kicking Dilwar's legs because they didn't know that someone else already had - it wasn't a case of them all standing around kicking him again and again but of each kicking him as part of his own independent interrogation regime.  So, if these soldiers are to be believed, it was a lack of communication more than anything else that killed Dilwar.  Apparently, it wasn't important to coordinate the soldiers' efforts to extract information - which makes you wonder if information was ever the goal of the ""interrogation.""  So, ironically, it's more the gross incompetence and inefficiency of torture than the sheer brutality of it that may convince people to outlaw it once and for all.",5,Do They Really Want It Hidden?,1227139200,"11 20, 2008",2008,1790,"['Yes', 'torture', 'depicted', 'film', 'embarrassment', 'possible', 'war', 'crime', 'Yes', 'Administration', 'auspices', 'occurred', 'relish', 'secrecy', 'else', 'yet', 'wonder', 'perhaps', 'was', 'reason', 'let', 'be', 'revealed', 'overrode', 'reasons', 'keeping', 'hidden', 'Namely', 'de-sensitize', 'American', 'public', 'very', 'idea', 'torture', 'fact', 'as', 'much', '40', '%', 'American', 'people', 'approve', 'torture', 'not', 'statistic', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'now', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'action', 'not', 'merely', 'read', 'news', 'reports', 'simple', 'truth', 'torture', 'will', 'be', 'easier', 'not', 'harder', 'get', 'away', 'next', 'time', 'precedent', 'been', 'set', 'now', 'people', 'are', 'beginning', 'get', 'used', 'idea', 'former', 'soldiers', 'interviewed', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'have', 'been', 'trial', 'expressed', 'great', 'remorse', 'time', 'were', 'executing', 'torture', 'focus', 'was', 'only', 'doing', 'duty', 'not', 'questioning', 'most', 'telling', 'most', 'chilling', 'piece', 'soldiers', 'story', 'was', 'took', 'turn', 'kicking', 'Dilwar', 'legs', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'someone', 'else', 'already', 'had', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'standing', 'around', 'kicking', 'again', 'again', 'kicking', 'part', 'own', 'independent', 'interrogation', 'regime', 'So', 'soldiers', 'are', 'be', 'believed', 'was', 'lack', 'communication', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'killed', 'Dilwar', 'Apparently', 'was', ""n't"", 'important', 'coordinate', 'soldiers', 'efforts', 'extract', 'information', 'wonder', 'information', 'was', 'ever', 'goal', 'interrogation', 'So', 'ironically', 'more', 'gross', 'incompetence', 'inefficiency', 'torture', 'sheer', 'brutality', 'may', 'convince', 'people', 'outlaw', 'once']",Taxi To the Dark Side

Danzig,"[1, 1]","Quite simply the most important documentary made in recent years.Here is the true shame of the Bush administration -- the complete disregard for the Geneva Conventions in the prosecution of the ""war on terror"".Most shocking of all is the revelation that one of the key pieces of ""intelligence"" on which Colin Powell based his rationale for the Iraq War was false, the claim of a prisoner tortured into confessing what his captors wanted to hear.Powell states that the day he pitched the war at the United Nations, relying on this grossly deficient intelligence, was one of the most ""embarrassing"" of his life.Embarrassing?  More appropriate words might be ""tragic"", ""disastrous"", or ""unconscionable"".Worse, the Bush administration policy of employing torture, kangaroo courts, and the suspension of habeus corpus -- in defiance of the Constitution and the Geneva Conventions -- came right from the top.Here is Cheney snarling that these methods were necessary in the war on terror.  Here is Bush trying to sell the need for ""harsh"" interrogation techniques as late as 2006.  Here are presidential counsel John Yoo and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales trying to redefine ""torture"" as an acceptable component in prosecuting a war.The whole lot of them should be made to experience 40 hours of sleep deprivation, or forced standing, or waterboarding -- to see for themselves why these forms of coercion bring us down to the level of any terrorists walking the planet.FOR SHAME!  FOR SHAME!Let us hope that Barack Obama can help lead us back from this precipice of damnation to the brighter path Americans have chosen in previous generations.The DVD also includes special features not included in the theatrical release of the film.  Most notable of these is an interview with former President Jimmy Carter, who calls the Bush torture policies a disgrace as well as a sharp break with traditional American values.The director's father also makes an appearance.

I'm not sure why I procrastinated, but seeing I am only the fifteenth person to review it here, perhaps others are dragging their feet, too.  Even my public library already demoted the TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE D.V.D. to its no-charge borrow section while older titles - many of them garbage - are still in the rental area.But seconds into TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE, its compelling story of the Bush administration rejection of the Geneva Convention drew my attention like a soldier pointing a gun at you as you approach a checkpoint.  While it centers on the murder of an Afghan taxi driver by American troops at a Bagram, Afghanistan military base, TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE covers the fares innocent people have paid at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay and secret prisons in the so-called war on terror.The poor use terrorism to wage war.  The wealthy use war to terrorize.  What a war on terror is supposed to be, I don't know, but as TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE documents, neither does George W. Bush.  Just as Bush's approaches to invading Iraq and responding to Hurricane Katrina demonstrated no organization, TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE shows the same non-oversight of prisoner interrogation in the U.S. occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan.  Director Alex Gibney, in an interview on DEMOCRACY NOW!, said American soldiers who tortured prisoners to death ""had no training, and they were forced to do things that ultimately they're deeply haunted by. It's not something that they ever signed up for. And so, you see how that process worked. As one person says in the film, they were engulfed in what was called a fog of ambiguity, tremendous pressure to get intelligence but almost no training and no guidelines.""TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE reports that none other than the United States military declared no fewer than 37 of these deaths of suspects to be homicides.

The tape indicates that a recent poll indicates that 35% of Americans now believe that torture is OK. Now some people have authoritarian personalities, so some people are naturally going to believe in torture. And some people come from totalitarian societies, so they naturally believe that torture is just a part of man's nature. But 35%??? This is a sad state that our country has been brought to by Cheney, Rumsfield and subordinates like John Woo. The film reiterates that the torture techniques so famous as filmed in Abu Ghraib, migrated from Bagram and GITMO like a deadly virus. It was not some new phenomenon devised by privates and other low level soldiers, but a secret plan by Cheney and Rumsfeld to help get testimony (albeit, false) that Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11 so that they could convince Americans that we needed to invade Iraq. Sad to say, that several men were killed by Americans in these prisons, and many, many have committed suicide rather than live like animals for years for nothing that they have ever been done.

This may be the most important documentary film on the ""War on Terror"", and while it is a liberal polemic film, it does an effective job of arguing its case by showing its graphic images, instead of having someone like filmmaker Michael Moore seen onscreen ranting and raving. The central saga which runs through the nearly two-hour long film is the last taxi ride of a young Afghan taxi driver, Dilawar, an innocent bystander who was picked up by American troops, tortured, and died from his severe injuries at the American detention center in Bagram, Afghanistan.""Taxi to the Dark Side"" deserves the ample recognition it has earned, and may be remembered as a superb documentary film in the tradition of Edward R. Murrow's ""Harvest of Shame"". But it isn't perfect for the following reasons. First it accepts as gospel truth, the fact that most of those being held by American soldiers in Afghanistan, Iraq and Cuba are as innocent as Dilawar was. Second it lacks more insightful analysis from the likes of noted military defense attorney Eugene Fidell, who represented my cousin, former U. S. Army chaplain James Yee (Much to my amazement, Yee's filmed testimony was not included at all in the final cut of this film.). Will ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" change the opinions of many? Hopefully it will force those who've seen it to ask serious, probing questions about inhumane treatment of prisoners by some American soldiers, and perhaps persuade them to convince the Federal political leadership in Washington, D.

My brother served in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba a decade ago and he told me back then how they treated the refugees and I was appalled. For that reason I may have been a little more prepared for the severity of this story than the average person who will watch it. I will not write a disclaimer such as ""not for the faint of heart"" because I think that everyone needs to see this film however sensitive they are to violence.Dilawar was an Afghan cabdriver and was going about his day to day life until he was arrested after being accused of participating in a rocket attack of a U.S. base. He was really arrested for no reason but that didn't stop the paranoid U.S. forces from subjecting him to the most vicious torture at Begram prison.Dilawar died after two straight days of torture and the complete story is told by some of the soldiers who actually tortured him. They used sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation, extreme acts of violence, and all because he was *suspected of helping to aid in an attack.As we've come to learn with these torture stories the blame for Cheney's ""Dark Side"" torture policies is always placed on the soldiers who were ordered to commit the acts. They did kill Dilawar but they also had systemic tolerance in the military toward torture and the chain of command never went upward when it came down to the punishment of the people who implemented the policies. The torturers turn out to be victims too, basically scape goats for the policies regarding torture. Dilawar was found to be innocent it should be noted.Alex Gibney is the most skilled of filmmakers in that he puts faces and horrific results on on Bush and Cheney's so called ""War on Terror."" He deftly makes the case that these torture tactics were taught which is made obvious through recounting many of the similar tortures that happened in Guantanamo and, most infamously, at Abu Graibh. Now we see the victim without a hood and, in much the same way, our violations of the interrogation restrictions of the Geneva Conventions without the hood of secrecy that our government has desperately tried to keep hidden from the world.America doesn't look at all virtuous after this. This is a must watch for anyone with a Gung-ho attitude about war and anyone who is concerned with the concept of human rights, guilty until proven innocent and the notion of Habeus Corpus.Once can also benefit greatly by listening to the audio commentary. Such as with his film ""Enron; Smartest Guys In The Room"" he further elucidated on some of the aspects of the film that couldn't be fit into a feature length documentary.This should be required viewing.Kevin W.

1171982,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001BEK8FQ,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","""Taxi to the Dark Side"" uses the case of an Afghani taxi driver who died at the hands of his American interrogators in 2002 to explore the origins of the use of torture by United States military and intelligence forces and how and why the practice spread through the military since the invasion of Afghanistan. It begins with a mystery. Dilawar, a young Afghani taxi driver, was stopped on the road by an Afghan militia, who arrested him and his 3 passengers and turned them over to US forces. He was taken to the military prison on Bagram Air Base, where he died 5 days later. The reasons for his arrest, his guilt or innocence, or the cause of his death is not immediately apparent. As the film progresses, those and more questions are answered, as its scope broadens to the use of torture in the ""War on Terror"", in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Guantanamo Bay.Having seen Alex Gibney's ""Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room"", I was expecting this to be a solid documentary on the senseless death of an unfortunate Afghani man and perhaps an expose on what went on inside Bagram Prison. But I've seen films and read articles on the treatment of detainees in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp before, and I wasn't expecting anything new. I was surprised to find that ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" is a thoughtful, ambitious film that attempts to explain the seismic shift in US policy and military procedure that encouraged, and even demanded, the use of torture in the War on Terror, including on thousands of detainees who were in custody only because the US paid Afghan militias a bounty per head for terror ""suspects"".Along with its ambition, what sets ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" apart from other documentaries on related subjects is that writer/director Alex Gibney doesn't solicit opinions and analysis on the use of torture from academics and pundits. The only victims he speaks to are Dilawar's family and his fellow prisoner at Bagram, Moazzem Begg, a British national who was also at Guantanamo and had some contact with Dilawar while he was in custody. Gibney interviews the perpetrators: the Military Police and Military Intelligence personnel who were court-martialed for Dilawar's death. And he interviews conservatives who were alarmed by the use of torture and tried to stop it, including former Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora and Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell. This is an engrossing study of, not just what happened to Dilawar and others like him, but why and what the consequences may be.The DVD (ThinkFilm 2008): ""Frank Gibney Interview"" (16 min) is a home video of Alex Gibney's father, who was an officer in charge of interrogation at the Iroquois Point Prison Camp in Pearl Harbor during WWII, talking about his own experiences as an interrogator and his views of the Bush administration's policies on interrogation. ""Outtakes"" are actually 5 deleted scenes. ""Alex Gibney on PBS Now"" (18 min) is an interview that the filmmaker gave David Brancaccio . ""Robert Scheer Interviews Alex Gibney on LinkTV"" (14 min) is about torture as a political tool and the soldiers who were brought to trial. There is a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min), and a feature commentary by Alex Gibney. He talks about locations, the film's structure, the archival footage, the interviews, and his interpretation of the policies discussed in the film.

That surprised me, until I realized that Alex Gibney produced and directed both films.  ""No End..."" was about government mistakes in Iraq. A powerful film. What makes ""Taxi"" special, is that it's about real people affected by our involvement, and the failure of those in command to take responsibility for unconscionable actions, blaming younger recruits, resulting in their dishonorable discharges. Rumsfeld and Cheney and even President Bush are shown to condone the torture and stuff; after the fact, it turns out that most of those tortured and killed had nothing to do with anything, except trying to live their lives in peace.  This film is so powerful, and not for the weak of heart. Very thought-provoking and definitely a point of view to be considered. The paranoia of certain military commanders in Afghanistan needs to be addressed, and forcing innocent soldiers to commit atrocities against detainees should be cause for those soldiers to rebel. So much is said; so much is sad; and the upper-crust is always gonna squash the little guy. This seems to be  prevalent in our military system and it's sickening (as much as I respect our soldiers). It's very clear that, after our torture and abuse of innocent victims, that the US will be hated, and propaganda, as it will, can only deteriorate our intentions. The initial intentions were brought out in ""No End..."" Where do we go from here? Powerful film, highly recommended.
