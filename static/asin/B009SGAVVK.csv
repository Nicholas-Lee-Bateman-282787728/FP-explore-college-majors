1601845,A30WXSK6N4J0CZ,B009SGAVVK,Christian R. Unger,"[0, 0]","Rurouni Kenshin is shot to be a translation of common manga / anime style visuals into a movie. This means that at times the look is a little odd, and although not off putting raises questions over intent.The other thing is that being an movie means that there had to be some changes. The most obvious is that the main villain (sword fighter) Ud&#333; Jin-e is no longer the same as in the source material: he is an amalgamation of the villain from the first TV show. Himself from later on in the series, and rather than being a standalone character / big boss, he works for the other villain (not a sword fighter) Takeda Kanry&#363;. Other character are slightly different, though in all instances not substantially so.As you can guess the plot too is an amalgamation of multiple shows, though overall it feels quite well transitioned.The film stays true to the amine's style, and character's traits. There is a bit of fan service in there which will make fans smile and is coherent enough (by a long shot) that non fans will be able to enjoy the film. Irrespective though a lot of the historic setting is not explained which might be an issue to non-Japanese viewers who might not know generally what happened leading up to the fictional events of this movie. Overall that's not an issue: there was a war, Kenshin was on the winning side and decides to stop killing. Others have either adapted or carry a grudge, and because of the power shift criminal elements are able to thrive.Characters are largely taken as established which makes especially Sait&#333; Hajime feel one dimensional, although he does only play a very minor role in this film, with some of his actions being implied and then only if you know his character. Overall though this does not detract.The movie is aimed at a wide audience, as the manga was with lots of action, comedy and a rich setting. It isn't required that the audience know the source material, though a slight background in the events of the Meiji Restoration / End of the Tokugawa Shogunate would not go astray. Despite being long (over two hours) it is never dull, and presents a beautiful translation of the source material into live action.",4,a faithful adaptation of manga / anime to live action,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,2182,"['Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'shot', 'be', 'translation', 'common', 'manga', '/', 'anime', 'style', 'visuals', 'movie', 'times', 'look', 'little', 'odd', 'not', 'putting', 'raises', 'questions', 'intent.The', 'other', 'thing', 'being', 'movie', 'had', 'be', 'changes', 'most', 'obvious', 'main', 'villain', 'sword', 'fighter', 'Ud', '333', 'Jin-e', 'no', 'longer', 'same', 'source', 'material', 'amalgamation', 'villain', 'first', 'TV', 'show', 'later', 'series', 'rather', 'being', 'standalone', 'character', '/', 'big', 'boss', 'other', 'villain', 'not', 'sword', 'fighter', 'Takeda', 'Kanry', '363', 'Other', 'character', 'are', 'slightly', 'different', 'instances', 'not', 'substantially', 'so.As', 'can', 'guess', 'plot', 'too', 'amalgamation', 'multiple', 'shows', 'overall', 'quite', 'well', 'transitioned.The', 'film', 'stays', 'true', 'amine', 'style', 'character', 'traits', 'bit', 'fan', 'service', 'will', 'make', 'fans', 'smile', 'coherent', 'enough', 'long', 'shot', 'non', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Irrespective', 'lot', 'historic', 'setting', 'not', 'explained', 'might', 'be', 'issue', 'non-Japanese', 'viewers', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'generally', 'what', 'happened', 'leading', 'up', 'fictional', 'events', 'movie', 'not', 'issue', 'was', 'war', 'Kenshin', 'was', 'winning', 'side', 'stop', 'killing', 'Others', 'have', 'adapted', 'carry', 'grudge', 'power', 'shift', 'criminal', 'elements', 'are', 'able', 'thrive.Characters', 'are', 'largely', 'taken', 'established', 'especially', 'Sait', '333', 'Hajime', 'feel', 'one', 'dimensional', 'only', 'play', 'very', 'minor', 'role', 'film', 'actions', 'being', 'implied', 'then', 'only', 'know', 'character', 'Overall', 'not', 'detract.The', 'movie', 'aimed', 'wide', 'audience', 'manga', 'was', 'lots', 'action', 'comedy', 'rich', 'setting', ""n't"", 'required', 'audience', 'know', 'source', 'material', 'slight', 'background', 'events', 'Meiji', 'Restoration', '/', 'End', 'Tokugawa', 'Shogunate', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'astray', 'being', 'long', 'two', 'hours', 'never', 'dull', 'beautiful', 'translation', 'source', 'material', 'live', 'action']",N/A

I love how the writers wove a couple of storylines together, and am very grateful that they included Saito even though he's not supposed to come in until the Kyoto arc.The actors are fantastic; truly the characters come to life. Takeru Sato as Kenshin perfectly embodies the gentle goofiness of the wanderer, and then switches to the deadly cold-blooded focus of the Battosai. It's seriously like he becomes a different person. My other favorite standout is Yosuke Eguchi as Saito. He is just SO Saito! In the battle of Toba Fushimi, when he's walking around slashing people while smoking a cigarette...so very Saito. But that is not to shortchange the other actors. They were all perfectly cast.*****SPOILERS FOLLOW*****The major arc of the storyline is the Kanryu Takeda arc, but with Aoshi and the Oniwaban replaced with Jin-ei, so those two stories are woven together. The introduction of Sanosuke is abbreviated, but still satisfying. Yahiko gets little screen time, which is just fine with me.The problems I have with the movie are so picky they're hardly worth mentioning. Probably the most major one is that Kaoru seems more helpless than she should. Sure, she's still plucky and still fights, but she gets rescued a lot. Also, by leaving her out of the fight at Kanryu's mansion, it seems to emphasize that she's not an effective fighter. (I know she was left behind story-wise so she could be kidnapped by Jin-ei, but still.)I also wish the fight between Kenshin and Saito could have been the full-blown fight from the beginning of the Kyoto arc, but I'm grateful that they had ANY fight scene since Saito shouldn't even be here. Plus, I understand that it was more dramatic then for Kenshin to become the Battosai at the end in his battle with Jin-ei.I really enjoy the fight scenes, which do NOT seem to be full of CGI effects. I can't say which one was my favorite: the fight at the dojo, the fight outside Kanryu's mansion, or the final battle with Jin-ei.

The only thing that I didn't like too much is how much they changed the other in which events take place compared to the series but I realize that it's never easy adapting a TV series to the big screen & things have to be changed in other to make it work.

After so many bad or just okay live action adaptions of favorite anime, Rurouni Kenshin has achieved what fans could only hope for. The period this takes place on is wonderfully portrayed, both gritty and beautiful and shows well the Japanese traditions. I loved the cinematography. The fighting was unbelievably cool to watch, and done in such away that never made me thinking something looked silly and I could only watch with wide eyes thinking, this is awesome. The style and even blood is reminiscent of anime fighting, but it was all epic and nothing cheezy about it. Even the blood was handled artfully. To top it all off the plot and the characters were truly brought to life. The story blended well from start to finish, merging a few different storylines. The actor for Kenshin nailed the role and all the personalities whether with a silly cute smile, saddened by his past, or the dark killer he had been. I have to say every actor and actress in this movie shined in their roles. Despite the darkness of some of the story, it never loses sight of the heart of Kenshin and even has some scenes I was laughing quite hard. In my fiances word, Sanosuke last fight had the best intermission to a fight he had ever seen. Neither of us could stop laughing. I wish more movies could achieve what this one has done and thoroughly look forward to a sequel.

1601870,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B009SGAVVK,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[2, 2]","Being a fan of the anime series and the film ""Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal"", I was ecstatic to learn that a live-action adaptation of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" became one of Japan's highest-grossing film of 2012 and an international success in Asia. Based on the manga by Nobuhiro Watsuki, the film follows the adventures of a young man named Kenshin Himura during the Meiji period. Fans of the anime series would be satisfied with this live-action version as it does capture the mood, tempo and style of the anime series. The film features superb swordplay that I have not seen since ""Azumi"" and while newcomers may see it as a `hack and slash' affair, I am impressed with the amount of effort that went through its production, that director Keishi Otomo truly expressed love for the source material.The film has been inspired by seasons 1 and 2 of the anime series. After living the life of an assassin since the tender age of 14 and fighting in the Bakumatsu war, Himura Kenshin (Takeru Satoh) has gained a reputation as a legendary swordsman that he has earned the much feared title of ""Hitokiri Battosai"". Now a wandering samurai, he seeks to atone for his sins by taking an oath of not killing and protecting those in need. In his travels, Kenshin comes across the daughter of a deceased dojo master, Kaoru (Emi Takei) and aides her against her assailants. The two have formed a unique form of friendship, as Kenshin realizes a chance to find peace. But when a crooked businessman named Takeda (Teruyuki Kagawa) has plans of his own for taking over the harbor where the dojo stood, Kenshin must do what he can to protect what he has found. With the aid of Sagara Sanosuke (Munetaka Aoki), he must confront the forces of Takeda and save the life of a young woman named Megumi (Yu Aoi). But his past just continues to haunt him as a master swordsman called Jin-ei who delves in the Jutou mystical arts, wants Kenshin's blood.Director Otomo manages to keep the essence of the anime alive when it came to tempo, mood and style. I do have to admit that deviations from the source material was inevitable for editing and pacing purposes. I could say that the movie was loosely based off the first couple of seasons of the anime series, as characters such as Sagara, Yahiko (Taketo Tanaka), Saito Hajime (Yosuke Eguchi) and Kaoru all make appearances to drive the film's plot. Sadly, while I enjoyed this film, I cannot deny that characterization was a little too light and the screenplay opts to put all its energy in the fight choreography and action set pieces. The emotional content of the material was admittedly a little lost, as the movie revolved mainly on Kenshin and Kaoru.Villains such as Gein (Gou Ayano) and Banjin Inui (Genki Sudo) were easily recognizable by fans but they were a little underwritten into the script. This is not a complaint, but an observation. The motivations behind the Jin-ei Udo's actions weren't sold into the screenplay that the only tension I felt between him and Kenshin was the coming climactic showdown. There was a missed opportunity in developing the 'sword that spilled a lot of blood' and just how Jin-ei got his mystical skills. The screenplay should've done well in developing that part of its narrative. I know fans of the anime could easily connect the dots, but this does leave newcomers left with little more than what was presented to them by the film.Be that as it may, the film does succeed in a way that it intended. Mild humor was brought forth by Sagara and while lacking in development, it was easy to get interested with the film's plot as it moved briskly and never lost its energy. The swordplay was truly the film's top draw, Otomo shot the scenes in a way that mimicked the style and intensity of the anime series. It was also never a loss for blood, as the swordfights were brutal at certain moments, and yet it never lost that feeling of rhythm in the emotional drama with each hack and slash. There was a certain identity to its swordplay that I enjoyed, while there was no gore, it had the sense of poignancy that I have to expect from samurai films. I do have to say that Otomo did his homework in selling the film through the fight choreography, there were mild uses of special effects but they were only used to enhance the speed and strength of the struggle. The signature moves of Sagara and Kenshin also came into play, and if this was any indication, there may be a lot of room for a sequel since Kenshin had only began to fight. The costumes and set designs were all done in the spirit of the anime, and the colors leaned towards Earth colors as with any other jidai geki film. This gave the film a cinematic feel that is familiar to fans of the genre.The performances were decent for the most part. Satoh made for a very credible Kenshin Himura. He had the look, the appearance and the personality to pull it off. With Otomo's cool editing tricks, he made the Kenshin character come alive in all the fight sequences, and Satoah looked really cool in performing the moves. Emi Takei makes for a very convincing Kaoru Kamiya, as the woman with the strength to influence a conflicted Kenshin. Aoki was fun as the cocky Sagara, but I had mixed feelings with Kagawa as Kanryu Takeda. He was a little too manic for his own good. Koji Kikkawa was magnificent as the creepy Battosai even though his character lacked depth, he was effective in the build up to the final showdown.""Rurouni Kenshin"" the live-action film may be flawed, but it was one of the better ones I have seen along with ""Azumi"", ""Death Note"" and ""Shinobi Heart Under Blade"" (Lord knows there is a lot of them out there that are bad). The film was made with love of the source material, and the action swordplay was just fantastic. It was fast, hard-hitting and exciting to watch. Newcomers may feel a little lost with the lack of characterization and development, but fans of the original material and the anime series would feel right at home. I would advise those who have no prior knowledge of the anime series to take a look at ""Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal"", as it will give you much needed background to the character (really seeing the first two seasons of the anime series would be more beneficial). This film is fine companion piece to the anime film and the series, that fans will not be able to stay away. Me, I am a fan so it gets a High Recommendation from me to its fans. To non-fans, at the very least, it is a solid hack and slash affair, that is really well done.
