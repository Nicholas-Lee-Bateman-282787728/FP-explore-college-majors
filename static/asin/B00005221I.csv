But the other day out of sheer boredom and the wonderful price of this set. I picked it up. In the two days since I have watched all the episodes. What can I say...now I am a fan.The show for the most part was alot deeper than I ever thought. It also has the ability to take us in one direction and just when you think it is totally predictable, the story takes a twist.There was only a couple of episodes I wasn't keen on. But even they had some redeeming quality. Buffy shows some very intense emotions at times. Especially in the season finally. Giles is amazing and for me the most interesting character.My only serious complaint is with Angel. He seems to turn up drop messages and disappear. That isn't so bad except some of the things he could easily taken care of himself. I think they were unsure what to do with him. If he does too much it takes away from Buffy. But really they could have done more.All said and done it is an excellent price and a good buy.

Burchfield,"[2, 2]","I had heard about the Buffy series for quite a while, how good it was supposed to be and so on, but couldn't watch it locally until FX started reruns of the first five seasons. The plot sounds like a joke, so does the title, but Buffy the Vampire Slayer actually works very well. The stories generally are good, maybe better on average than most series, character development is much better than most shows deliver. If you can handle the idea of a teenaged girl with super abilities doing battle with evil creatures, often coming up with snappy little comments during the fight (typically the  fights look very well choreographed), you'll find plenty to watch here. I've often noticed throughout the series that the stories seem to have a very developed background (based on fact?)and many of the characters can come up with the most off the wall comments or actions during a scene. Sometimes a character will make an appearance in one episode and be seen in others later on, maybe even years later, very unusual for a series to do that the way Buffy does it. This show is one of the few that can even take a weak story and manage to come up with some good points. Buffy the Vampire Slayer has an unusual treatment of the battle with vampires and demons concept but it is done very well. The box is marked 12 episodes, some have said it called for 24 as later seasons have, all I really have to complain about is that the cast bios are about 2 years out of date which would fit in with what someone said about these DVD's first coming out about then in the rest of the world.",4,Who would've believed such an idea could work so well,1012608000,"02 2, 2002",2002,1575,"['had', 'heard', 'Buffy', 'series', 'quite', 'while', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'locally', 'FX', 'started', 'reruns', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'plot', 'joke', 'so', 'title', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'stories', 'generally', 'are', 'good', 'maybe', 'better', 'average', 'most', 'series', 'character', 'development', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'shows', 'deliver', 'can', 'handle', 'idea', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'super', 'abilities', 'doing', 'battle', 'evil', 'creatures', 'often', 'coming', 'up', 'snappy', 'little', 'comments', 'fight', 'typically', 'fights', 'look', 'very', 'well', 'choreographed', ""'ll"", 'find', 'plenty', 'watch', 'here', ""'ve"", 'often', 'noticed', 'series', 'stories', 'seem', 'have', 'very', 'developed', 'background', 'based', 'fact', 'many', 'characters', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'most', 'wall', 'comments', 'actions', 'scene', 'character', 'will', 'make', 'appearance', 'one', 'episode', 'be', 'seen', 'others', 'later', 'maybe', 'even', 'years', 'later', 'very', 'unusual', 'series', 'do', 'way', 'Buffy', 'show', 'one', 'few', 'can', 'even', 'take', 'weak', 'story', 'manage', 'come', 'up', 'good', 'points', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'unusual', 'treatment', 'battle', 'vampires', 'demons', 'concept', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'box', 'marked', '12', 'episodes', 'have', 'said', 'called', '24', 'later', 'seasons', 'have', 'really', 'have', 'complain', 'about', 'cast', 'bios', 'are', '2', 'years', 'date', 'would', 'fit', 'what', 'someone', 'said', 'DVD', 'first', 'coming', 'out', 'then', 'rest', 'world']",N/A

We see her and her gang face vampires and all sorts of other unpleasant creatures and demons (and most of the episodes deal with non - vampire creatures...). But we also get to see other aspects of teenage life: Buffy's struggles with being unpopular and being teased by thepopular crowd, especially Cordelia, after being popular herself in her old school. Or the romantic triange she's in with Xander and Willow. Or better make it a square if we throw Angel into the equasion...The series also manages to combine comedy, drama and scares / creeps very well...Now for the point I really don't like about this set: the extras. There are a few, and they're interesting (Joss Wheadon's commentary, a few explanations by him on a few episodes), but there are so few of them! The commentary, for instance, is only for the first 2 episodes, but a commentary on the last episode would have been great too.

Felton ""voracious reader""","[7, 7]","It's about time; with Buffy, the Vampire Slayer alreading in its 6th season, US fans have long been waiting for the release of earlier seasons on DVD. Finally our patience is rewarded.This set contains all 12 episodes of the first season (it was a mid-season replacement and thus had only 12 episodes in its first season) plus interviews with Joss Whedon(creator) and David Boreanaz(actor who plays Angel), a photo gallery, original tv series trailer, and commentary by Joss Whedon on the first two episodes ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest.""The Episodes: Excellent-- Buffy, the Complete First season is a must for any Buffy fan or for any genre fan who has not watched the show before but wants to begin at the beginning. This original and amazingly literate series is not to be missed.Extras: Good--The interviews with Joss Whedon and David Boreanaz are the same ones from the vhs packs previously released in the US. The original trailer is fun to see, and the photo gallery is fine, but mostly promo shots we've all seen before. The best feature is the commentary. Joss Whedon does a great job of interjecting interesting and amusing comments while reviewing the first two episodes. Commentary can be hilarious or dull depending on who's providing it. Joss Whedon manages to be both informative and silly at times providing a middle-ground that works quite well, especially given that this was his first crack at commentary.Picture quality: Fair--The episodes were originally shot on 16mm. The lighting, art direction, and cinematography go along way to disguising this, but you can't escape the graininess at times.Sound quality: Good--There's an occassional hiccup in the sound on a couple of episodes. That may be a manufacturing error or it might just be my copy.Price: Excellent--Full seasons of tv shows on DVD can be horrifically pricy (e.g. The X-Files). At [the price]..., the Buffy complete first season is an amazing deal even with it's half season of only 12 episodes. The original VHS 3 packs (6 episodes) were priced the same.

First, and I think this was addressed by others, the ""Previously on Buffy"" scenes were deleted, which is a little jarring. The music was apparently all scored together, so when you start an episode it feels like you start 2 or 3 bars into a piece of music.Other than that, my only complaint is that I want more commentaries!! The two commentaries and several featurettes by Joss Whedon are superb. He really brings exactly what I want to a commentary track -- info on the actors, and decisions that were made during the episode, and why. He explains his premise for a lot of decisions, and is able to admit when he could have done better. It is especially interesting on this first season DVD, having already seen most of the other seasons on broadcast TV, because I already know how many of the characters and specail effects have evolved.As for the really good parts: The actual media is a very good quality. Nice sound, nice crisp images.Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an excellent show, in that Joss Whedon and the writers are able to bring up a lot of issues relevant to ""growing up"" with out being preachy. In a lot of ways, Buffy is about 2 things: breaking stereotypes and peoples expectations; but also growing up in a very *normal* way, despite being or dealing with the supernatural and supernormal.Overall, I highly recommend this box set.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a smart, funny and sometimes very scary series.I think the series improved in later seasons (particularly the 2nd and 3rd, although it still produces great episodes even in the 6th season). But there's still a lot of good stuff at the beginning. The characters are so fresh and new. Xander loves Buffy. Willow loves Xander. Less melancholy in the Buffy/Angel relationship. Were the characters ever this young?It's a bit strange for me because I jumped on the Buffy bandwagon in the summer between the 2nd and 3rd seasons. So, for me, first season Buffy is a bit like looking at high school (or even baby) photos of friends I met in university.My favourite episode in this season is the finale, ""Prophecy Girl"" where Buffy faces the propechy of her impeding death. As she pleads to her mentor, ""Giles, I'm sixteen. I don't want to die."" Not the brainless commentary that critics who have never actually watched the show maintain. (Most critics who have watched the series given high praise.)The extras -- well, a bit light. I did enjoy Joss Whedon's commentary on the first two episodes. The ""interviews"" are recycled from the earlier video tape release (which only featured a selected 6 episodes, as opposed to the full 12 on DVD).And the video quality isn't the best.

563928,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B00005221I,Amanda,"[1, 1]","In my opinion, Buffy the Vampire Slayer is still great, if not better, even in its seventh season. But nothing can compare to the very first season, when everything was a little darker, a little freakier, a little newer. I didn't start watching Buffy until its fourth season, so I had to rely on those handy reruns on TV in order to catch up on everything from the very beginning.Now, I have to say I like the later episodes better (mainly because Spike is my favorite character, and he didn't become a series regular until season 4), but season one was great nonetheless. The later episodes have been wittier, and sometimes sillier, but they can't compare to the creepiness of the first season, when Buffy first appeared at Sunnydale High, which just happened to be built over the Hellmouth. This was back when Buffy was a cheerleader by day, slayer by night; Xander was a total nerd; Willow was a sweet little wallflower; Cordelia was a snob; Angel was a vampire; and Giles- well, he was the trusty librarian/watcher. They were the good old days, when Buffy and the gang made all the high school viewers in the world appreciate their own high school, because no matter how bad their school was, they could at least say it wasn't built over a camping ground for every kind of evil imaginable.Included on this 3-DVD set are the series' first 12 episodes (remember? It was a mid-season replacement), interviews with creator Joss Whedon, commentary on the pilot episode, ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"", trailers, and more. For any Buffy fan, this is a must-have.

Fortunately, all of that improved as the show continued.  What this first season does well is set up the mythology of the slayer and the watchers.  It introduces the Master Vampire, Darla (who really came into her own on Angel), and of course Angelus himself.  What did not really work in this first season are the sidekicks.  I was never a big fan of Xander throughout the life of the show, but Willow was always a favorite.  However, the Willow of this first season is a far cry from the mega-witch Willow of later seasons.  Sometimes it was hard to watch.  I'm kind of glad I didn't watch this series when it first aired.

I was taking Tae Kwon Do at the time and thought the idea of a hot vampire slayer using bruce lee style martial arts would be a kick ass movie.  Even at the age of 14, I was disspointed, the jokes were too cheesed out and the only funny character was paul reubens.So I was dumbfounded that they were going to make it into a series.  I was even more suprised that I really liked it.  It was funny, clever, packed with action, and had characters that were quirky but you got to like.This first season was the shakiest.  You tend to see the main characters, especially the scoobies, to be more stereotypes than anything.  But they all have their charisma, and you get attached to them as the show progresses.  Buffy starts to show her weariness early on.  She wasn't more than a bubbleheaded teenager in the movie, but shows that she is accepting the weight of her responsibility.The episodes were for the most part good, and the big bad was menancing, they range from funny to disturbing.  Puppet show was one of the cheesier ones, yet still funny.  Where a demon is collecting brains to keep himself in human form but is being hunted by a demon hunter, a lewd perverse one that is trapped in the body of a puppet.  Teachers pet follows the same cut, playing on the classic hot for teacher story involving Xander.  Except the teacher that he falls for is a giant praying mantis in human form hunting for male virgins to mate with.The Pack is on a darker note.  Also a view on how cruel group mentality can be in high school.  Where Xander and the meanest clique in high school are somehow bonded with the spirit of a hyena and start preying on the weak, socially and physically.  There is also the Witch, about a womans obsession with regaining her past glory as a cheerleader.

Anyone remember in the great Cibo Matto performance thinking can great indy bands finally take over mainstream radio ,this was a very sweet innocent time when we all thought great music had a decent shot at mainstream .I know among the truly biggest Buffy fan's there will always be debates over when the show was at it's best be it right now the early year's or anytime inbetween.The truth is it doesn't matter .This great show means different thing's to different people . I suppose if i was a few years older or a few years younger maybe i would like the newer episodes better.The truly exciting thing is a show this unique and original would have lasted about 12 weeks on the air if it even made the air 20 years ago .Thanks to cable tv, minor networks, (upn wb) and DVD a great show like this can reach the entire world . I know myself i will gladly take the stroll down memory lane and purchase this dvd upon it's release  .

My mother recorded the Welcome to the Hellmouth episode for me, after watching that I was hooked, now I see that it was nice that they put more demons in it, its awesome. Even though the acting is kinda lame, this season is still good. I dont know what that one person was talking about not having special features because it even says special features before you watch every episode, look for it. It has commentary on Welcome to the Hellmouth, The Harvest, Angel, and the Puppet Show by Joss Whedon.  Sarah Michelle Gellar I think is the perfect Buffy.  My favorite episodes from this season is Welcome to the Hellmouth, Angel, and Prophecy Girl, I even got a little emotional when she didnt want to die.  The clown in nightmares shocked and scared me where I ran out of the room screaming because Im scared to death of clowns, so all clowns haters be careful.

563948,A1ZB49F18WK861,B00005221I,"Arg! ""Night_Hawk07""","[3, 3]","""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is truly one of the greatest shows ever. It premiered back on March 10, 1997 and eventually paved the way for many other TV shows (""Smallville"", ""Charmed"", ""Veronica Mars""). It's pretty mind-blowing to think about how this little show had so much momentum. It premiered on the fledgling WB network. The network that only really had one pseudo-successful show to date (""7th Heaven""). Originally opted as a mid-season replacements, I don't think anyone expected this show to have as much resonance as it did. There are many things that work, namely the acting and writing. All of this is in no small part thanks to the brilliant Joss Whedon who adapted this show from his original 1992 film of the same name.Let's talk about that 1992 film. To say the least, it bombed. The movie didn't seem to know if it was a comedy or horror film and it often struggled to find a plot. The film did, however, have some brilliant uses of dialogue. Joss Whedon acknowledged that the movie was butchered horribly and wanted nothing to do with it. This wasn't the first time his script would be mishandled and ruined in translation to film. His other feature ""Alien: Resurrection"" wasn't received too well either. Frustrated with film, it was no wonder Whedon turned to television. What came of this is wonderful.The show revolves around the character of Buffy Summers. On her first day at a new school she meets a wide array of new cohorts. The first of which is Cordelia Chase (the school bitch). Over the course of the episode she also meets Willow Rosenberg, Xander Harris and her would-be mentor Rupert Giles. These cast of characters are portrayed fantastically by their actor counterparts. The brilliance of these actors is what propels the show and sets it apart from many other dramas.What also sets the show apart is it's refusal to fall under one category. It does what the 1992 film failed to do: seamlessly mix together comedy, drama, horror, satire..you name it. The comedic elements come from the interaction between Buffy and her friends. Much of their dialog is derived from modern communication but hilarious uses of pop-culture recalls and banter is utilized. The horror element comes from the fact that Buffy is a vampire slayer. She protects the citizens of Sunnydale from not only said vampires, but demons and other things.Drama comes from the humanism of the characters. With so many fantasy elements woven into the show, a lesser show would have delved into a cartoonish formula with cardboard characters. The emotions felt by the characters is raw and most importantly, real.With all that said, the introduction season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" really was a preview of great things to come. The ratings weren't great but the network the show was originally broadcast on knew they had something special on their hands (and so did critics). A brilliant show made a brilliant first impression and it would not fail to create the phenomenon that the show is known as today. While it has been off the air since 2003, the ramifications of what Joss Whedon created thankfully still live on.",5,Preview of what was to come,1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,3121,"['Vampire', 'Slayer', 'truly', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'ever', 'premiered', 'back', 'March', '10', '1997', 'eventually', 'paved', 'way', 'many', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'Smallville', 'Charmed', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'pretty', 'mind-blowing', 'think', 'how', 'little', 'show', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'momentum', 'premiered', 'fledgling', 'WB', 'network', 'network', 'only', 'really', 'had', 'one', 'pseudo-successful', 'show', 'date', '7th', 'Heaven', 'Originally', 'opted', 'mid-season', 'replacements', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'expected', 'show', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'resonance', 'did', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'work', 'namely', 'acting', 'writing', 'small', 'part', 'thanks', 'brilliant', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'who', 'adapted', 'show', 'original', '1992', 'film', 'same', 'name.Let', 'talk', '1992', 'film', 'say', 'least', 'bombed', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'was', 'comedy', 'horror', 'film', 'often', 'struggled', 'find', 'plot', 'film', 'did', 'however', 'have', 'brilliant', 'uses', 'dialogue', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'acknowledged', 'movie', 'was', 'butchered', 'horribly', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'do', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'script', 'would', 'be', 'mishandled', 'ruined', 'translation', 'film', 'other', 'feature', 'Alien', 'Resurrection', 'was', ""n't"", 'received', 'too', 'well', 'either', 'Frustrated', 'film', 'was', 'wonder', 'Whedon', 'turned', 'television', 'What', 'came', 'wonderful.The', 'show', 'character', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'first', 'day', 'new', 'school', 'wide', 'array', 'new', 'cohorts', 'first', 'Cordelia', 'Chase', 'school', 'bitch', 'course', 'episode', 'also', 'Willow', 'Rosenberg', 'Xander', 'Harris', 'would-be', 'mentor', 'Rupert', 'Giles', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'fantastically', 'actor', 'counterparts', 'brilliance', 'actors', 'what', 'show', 'apart', 'many', 'other', 'dramas.What', 'also', 'show', 'apart', 'refusal', 'fall', 'one', 'category', 'what', '1992', 'film', 'failed', 'do', 'seamlessly', 'together', 'comedy', 'drama', 'horror', 'satire..you', 'name', 'comedic', 'elements', 'come', 'interaction', 'Buffy', 'friends', 'Much', 'dialog', 'derived', 'modern', 'communication', 'hilarious', 'uses', 'pop-culture', 'recalls', 'banter', 'utilized', 'horror', 'element', 'fact', 'Buffy', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'citizens', 'Sunnydale', 'not', 'only', 'said', 'vampires', 'demons', 'other', 'things.Drama', 'humanism', 'characters', 'so', 'many', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'woven', 'show', 'lesser', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'delved', 'cartoonish', 'formula', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'emotions', 'felt', 'characters', 'raw', 'most', 'importantly', 'real.With', 'said', 'introduction', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'really', 'was', 'preview', 'great', 'things', 'come', 'ratings', 'were', ""n't"", 'great', 'network', 'show', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'knew', 'had', 'something', 'special', 'hands', 'so', 'did', 'critics', 'brilliant', 'show', 'made', 'brilliant', 'first', 'impression', 'would', 'not', 'fail', 'create', 'phenomenon', 'show', 'known', 'today', 'been', 'off', 'air', '2003', 'ramifications', 'what', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'created', 'thankfully', 'still', 'live']",N/A

563954,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005221I,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[12, 13]","It's been a long time coming, but Buffy if finally hitting DVD here in America. I'm glad we get the quality of this brilliant show on DVD, but am highly disappointed with the extra features on the DVD. First off, there are all 12 episodes of the show's first season on 3 discs. Since it was a mid season replacement, it only had 12 episodes instead of the regular 22. The first season had a few monumental episodes like the two part opener ""Welcome To The Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"". Those two were put together as a premiere episode movie. ""Angel"" is an important and pivotal episode. It's where we first learn of who and what Angel really is. Alarming and fantastic. Then there's the season ender, ""Prophecy Girl"", which deals with Buffy defeating this season's main villain, The Master. The other 8 episodes run the gamut from good to mediocre. The weak ones are ""Teacher's Pet"", ""I Robot - You Jane"", and ""The Pack"". That last one does have some chilling and memorable moments tho. The better ones are ""Witch"", with Buffy dealing with a cheerleading witch who is getting the competition out of the way. ""Nightmares"" has our beloved scooby gang being confronted with their worst nightmares when they seem to be coming to life. It turns out that a comatose boy is projecting nightmares to come true after suffering a shocking abuse that I won't reveal here. ""Invisible Girl"" is a situation based in all too true reality. A plain jane girl literally becomes invisible because everyone at school, students and teachers, barely register that she's there. She's so invisible to them that she literally turns that way. ""The Puppet Show"" is a light, but fun, episode with the gang having to participate in the school play. There's a demon running aorund needing brains as well. I don't want to give anything else away. The reason this show is so loved and acclaimed is that this is just good, intelligent writing. The characters are strong and real. The actors had instant chemistry in the first episode and are all supreme actors. The history and mythology of the show are as rich and deep as you can get. This first season, however, didn't necessarily explore it as much as it did in the seasons to follow. The DVD extras however, lead much to be desired. You get commentary from creator Joss Whedon on episodes 1 and 2. You also get the original pilot script for the first episode. There's a photo gallery, and interviews with Joss and David Boreanaz. While the features here are nice, it just isn't enough. You'd think there would be more behind the scenes stuff and interviews. ... I hope [they] give us more goodies on future DVD releases. But, this still gets the full 5 stars.

563955,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,B00005221I,Beau Yarbrough,"[8, 8]","For anyone who's come in late to the Buffy phenomenon, this DVD set is a great bargain. These episodes pick up from the movie (and, frankly, make it unnecessary for anyone other than completists), and set up the Buffy show nicely.Who was Xander's and Willow's friend before Buffy arrived? Was Cordelia REALLY that mean before she went soft on Xander? Who were Willow and Xander infatuated with? And what was the deal with Angel?The first season sets up the rules for the Slayer (although some, like her ability to sense vampires, have gone by the wayside), the school years (including two very different principals, with the later being played by the actor famous for fan-favorite Quark on ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine""), Buffy having to maintain a secret identity, and the non-story arc episodes, including a very chilling episode, ""The Pack,"" in which Xander falls in with a very, very wrong crowd.This is only a half-season, as Buffy was originally a mid-season replacement. That's OK, as the overall story arc, about the Master being trapped beneath Sunnydale and attempting to get free and conquer the world, isn't the best the show had to offer (certainly not as good as season three's double threat of Faith and the Mayor). The Master as a character is a little campy and not quite as scary as Joss Whedon seemed to have wanted him to be, and the prosthetic teeth the actor wears makes him sound like an angry mole rather than the main vampire in the Buffy series. (For fun, try and trace all the prominent vampires' lineage in the show -- you'll see they all end up at the Master eventually.)Some justifiably famous episodes are present in this DVD, including the season ender ""Prophecy Girl,"" which includes some of Sarah Michelle Gellar's best acting in the series, and the growth of the character from the somewhat unsure of herself and overwhelmed novice slayer into the more confident pro she would become. And, of course, the events of this episode also set up a major surprise in season two ...Unfortunately, the DVD collection isn't as good as the episodes included. The added features are mostly the interviews made when half of these episodes were released on tape a few years ago, along with rather unimpressive publicity photos and a script. Further, the first episode, ""Welcome to the Hellmouth,"" is not as the show was originally aired, which included a voice-over and some graphics telling the history of the Slayers. For fans who have read the excellent ""Watcher's Guide"" companions to this series, this absence will be a little confusing, and it's baffling in any case. If Joss thought this material was some that he wished he hadn't put in the original episode, it would have been appropriate to put it on the DVD as an ""original opening credits"" feature. The final DVD also has a lengthy Universal Studios ad tacked onto the beginning, which is absolutely maddening. I wouldn't have minded if the DVDs had included ads for the DVD of the movie, or of future upcoming Buffy DVDs, but why do I care about this other junk?In any case, this DVD set is a steal for Buffy fans, and is essential viewing for fans of one of the best television shows of all time.

A teen drama that actually made sense. Albeit the demons and mouth of hell. Buffy Season I is a beautiful sight not only because of the unparalelled writing behind the show, but also the realization of the show itself with the little resources available.Taking an 18-year-old actress whose only true credits included an increasingly sappy soap opera, Whedon picked several other relatively new actors for his show. With it, he created a perfectly balanced chemistry which would propel many of the stars to genuine fame. His show also dared to depict demons and magic, a concept not touched on other shows of the time, save the X-Files, which never definitely had anything super-natural, only hints of it. Whedon's chance paid off. He created a show that would go on to last for seven years, and producing one spin-off, Angel.I give the show four stars mainly due to the lack of believability, which was a product of the poor funding of the show so early on. Also, there was very little background information provided on the main characters, other than Angel. Buffy's past was never fully explained, as the creators did not want to mess with the continuity created by the cinematic version of the show with the same name. All in all, excellent. Its a must have for any BTVS or Angel fan.",4,Almost Perfect,1053216000,"05 18, 2003",2003,1399,"['show', 're-defined', 'generation', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Season', 'was', 'something', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'before', 'teen', 'drama', 'actually', 'made', 'sense', 'demons', 'mouth', 'hell', 'Buffy', 'Season', 'beautiful', 'sight', 'not', 'only', 'unparalelled', 'writing', 'show', 'also', 'realization', 'show', 'little', 'resources', 'available.Taking', '18-year-old', 'actress', 'only', 'true', 'credits', 'included', 'increasingly', 'sappy', 'soap', 'opera', 'Whedon', 'picked', 'several', 'other', 'relatively', 'new', 'actors', 'show', 'created', 'perfectly', 'balanced', 'chemistry', 'would', 'propel', 'many', 'stars', 'genuine', 'fame', 'show', 'also', 'dared', 'depict', 'demons', 'magic', 'concept', 'not', 'touched', 'other', 'shows', 'time', 'save', 'X-Files', 'never', 'definitely', 'had', 'anything', 'super-natural', 'only', 'hints', 'Whedon', 'chance', 'paid', 'off', 'created', 'show', 'would', 'go', 'last', 'seven', 'years', 'producing', 'one', 'spin-off', 'Angel.I', 'give', 'show', 'four', 'stars', 'mainly', 'due', 'lack', 'believability', 'was', 'product', 'poor', 'funding', 'show', 'so', 'early', 'Also', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'background', 'information', 'provided', 'main', 'characters', 'other', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'past', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'creators', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'mess', 'continuity', 'created', 'cinematic', 'version', 'show', 'same', 'name', 'excellent', 'must', 'have', 'BTVS', 'Angel', 'fan']",N/A

This is no exception, except now she has Kung Fu. I think she has the ability to act, she just doesn't always flex it (or can't).Buffy Season One is taking the television series from the movie of the same name. Since it is the first season, it contains less episodes than the normal 22 of all the other seasons, it has only 12. This is because they shot it before they pitched it.The episodes:Ep. 1: Welcome to the Hellmouth16 year old buffy transfers to Sunnydale, but the librarian, Giles, haunts her about her destiny about being the Slayer.Ep. 2: The HarvestThe Master, villian of this season, reveals his true intentions.Ep. 3: WitchBuffy tries out for cheerleading, but a curse seems to befall the entire squad.Ep. 4: Teacher's PetA substitute teacher seems to get all the boys attentions, with horrific results.Ep. 5: Never Kill a boy on the first dateBuffy gets a date, and then falls into a vampire plot.Ep. 6: The PackA clique of mean teens get Xander involved when they are possessed by hyenas.Ep. 7: AngelBuffy gets close to Angel, only to find herself torn when she discovers his terrible secret and past.Ep. 8: I robot, you jane.Willow chats with an internet date, but what does it have to do with the demonology book she scanned?Ep. 9: The Puppet ShowSomeone is killing talent show contestants, and the ventriloquist act is mighty suspicious.Ep. 10: NightmaresEveryones nightmares are real, and only the Slayer can stop them.Ep. 11: Out of mind, out of sightAn unpopular girl turns invisible and seeks revenge on the 'In' crowd.Ep. 12: Prophecy GirlA prophecy foretells buffy's death, but she shows down the Master anyway.On disc one, is a few special features, including an interview with Whedon and Boreanaz. Also, Whedon does a commentary on the Pilot, although his commentary is mostly him watching, with a few bits of info. A pilot script, and trailer round it out. Disc 2 features a photo gallery and another interview with Whedon. And finally, disc 3 contains biographies for the cast and a final interview with Whedon.This season does little more than set up the characters, set the tone and theme of the series, and gives us a taste of the Hellmouth/High School connection. The major plot device is the use of the master as a villian that reappears thru out. However, in Dragonball fashion, he is finished within the whole season.I gave it one less star than it deserved because it is the pilot season, and thus the quality, quantity and feel is compromised.Overall, this is a good first season, but compared to the rest of the seasons (what with a bigger budget, better sound and audio, and more features) this one is required rather than requested. Overall, I say buy the Chosen Collection, and get them all at once.

So, I thought...""Well, what have you got to lose but a few dollars?"" and I ended up renting it. Boy, I'm glad I did. The show was a blast to watch.

563969,A2LEIANN1UZTHP,B00005221I,brainout,"[0, 0]","THIS SERIES NEEDS A SEQUEL.  Ideas for that, follow at the end of this review.This review is for the Amazon Prime viewing of the series.  I don't have it on DVD. Yet.  This series will be a privilege to own.  Truly first-class in every respect.  If you're in drama school or thinking about acting, directing, film editing, scriptwriting, etc. as a career -- this series is MUST WATCH.  Every skill one needs to acquire for A+ performance, is well depicted in this series.Were I teaching drama, I'd make it mandatory to watch this series over and over, dissecting it just as much as one must do with Shakespeare or Attic plays.You'll believe in Divine inspiration, when you see the genius combination of script, actors (especially in ensemble), choreography, timing, film editing.  FABULOUS.  Worth watching over and over, just to enjoy all that wit and skill!Yet during seasons 1 and 2 (which I first watched live on TV when it was initially aired),  I kept on thinking, 'this is worth watching while I clean my email.'  For vampire series are usually maudlin;  high-school series are yawn yawn yawn.  The movie version of Buffy was abysmal, I turned it off after 20 minutes or so.  Not even Donald Sutherland could save that movie.But this series is something else.  Sure, as the series progresses you're bombarded with occult advertising (one set of dark powers to save the world from another set of dark powers), but that's all the rage.  Lies always win.  Not even Christians care about Bible accuracy, so why should a secular show pay attention?Even so, here both acting plus script, deliver great entertainment and many insightful, impolitic moments.  If you're a fundy uptight Christian, don't watch.  If you're a mature Christian, do watch.  The writers hit controversial topics in each episode, and usually with aplomb.The writers give the actors many original and clever, zappy one-liners;  there are episodes totally removed from the plot without warning, as if Vampire SNL (Saturday Night Live); and the actors have great fun with it.  Wonderful cast chemistry.The fight choreography is good.  Humor and camp pervades.  The series is often self-deprecating, too.  Lots of features packed into every 45-minute (commercial free) episode, and worth re-watching.The acting is versatile, balanced, excellent.  Worth watching for the actors, alone.  But they'd not have much to do, were it not for the excellent script, direction, timing, film editing.  Good pace to each episode.  Always leaves you glad you watched.As the series progresses, many a famous ancient or recent song, film or movie or book is burlesqued in the subplots, so there is much for such fans to enjoy.  Quick example:  the famous 'Mack the Knife' song is visually burlesqued by a Joe-Pesci-like loan shark, replete with flashy suit, fins and rubbery mask;  or, the A-Team and Shaq get a 30-second imitation.  1950's sock hops, Bye Bye Birdie and Sandra Dee all form the backdrop for a 'magic spell' in a sterling musical episode.  Film noir is well represented, and it suddenly turns on then off, with panache.  Fabulous wit and timing.There are plenty of serious moments, which also suddenly turn on, then off.  Laced with the campy, self-deprecating humor, the serious moments are more meaningful, and you'll find yourself enlightened.Sorry if I sound gushy.  I've not seen such amalgamated, versatile genius in a TV series this gorgeous since MASH, and Rocky & Bullwinkle.Of course, all the demonology and magic in the series is from Jewish or Christian gnostic and classical Greek myths and drama.  They deliberately make the monsters LOOK like they are in costumes;  the costume's tackiness actually enhances both plot and meaning.The plotlines twist, in both predictable and unpredictable ways;  when predictable, the self-deprecation is high, so you don't even mind the predictability.  The writers love turning stereotypes upside down, and the actors have great fun with that.  Sterling performances.So, you'll forget to clean your email.=========================Season Seven is kinda rushed.  Its Episode 9 contained an astonishingly accurate translation of Proverbs 24:6, which is usually mistranslated in Bibles.  So how did the writers know that?  The mistranslations all imply that GROUPTHINK is superior to an individual's own wise (meaning from-God) counsel.  But the writers in the series wiped out that idea, and the whole theme of Season 7, followed suit.  Always must be ONE leader.So that, my friends, is the proper theme for a sequel.  So now, it's 2013.  If the old white under-subway set of Alias is still available, that could still be used as a new headquarters for Buffy & Co., for a souped up version of the new story.Here it is.  Okay, now all those empowered Slayers have had 10 years to actually TRAIN in their powers, but what did they do?  Nothing.  See, having power is not better than having love, and without love, there's no desire to train.  Without training, the power is wasted.  That's the big difference between evil and good.  God loves.  So power is used to effect the love, not to lord it over everyone else.  Satan loves power, so thinks he'll be happy if he can lord it over God.  Oldest story in the world, often told in simpering ways.So Buffy & Co. have to come back.  Hellmouth wasn't the only one of its kind.  The others are regrouping.  And the demons DID learn from the explosion, so have gone corporate, sophisticated.  Government is what they chose to get into, so they can rule that way.  Regulation has become complex, through the roof, political correctness is thus all the rage, and bloodsucking is brainsucking, so to speak.  Brains are sucked dry of independent thought, as government around the world -- especially in the US -- has come to micromanage everything 'for the greater good'.  Yeah, greater good for those who wield the power, not for humanity as a whole.  Freedom is nearly sucked dry.Now demons look like respectable humans and wear suits.  Invading boardrooms and especially Congress, the Presidency.  Quietly.  Deftly.  Evil has gone Versace.Not that the popular fight scenes have ended.  Oh no.  The minions still want their tea and baguette, so the would-be legacy of strength to defeat evil gets delayed and diluted into bam-bam-bam.  Vampires are now used in policework, to avoid the expense of a long trial.  And, to wipe out the slayers who didn't train as they should.  So gradually, all those slayers are whittled down.  Victory is in sight, for only a few slayers who were too smart to do the bam-bam thing, are left.Meanwhile, Buffy has recovered, and actually went back to school and learned some stuff, became something of a geek, like Willow.  Giles too, and Willow, have learned that the so-called black arts for good, are no better than their evil-usage counterparts.  But the covens still exist, cluelessly imagining that they can use the same old stuff to defeat the evil.  Angel, meanwhile, has finished his stint in Los Angeles, and has a found a new weapon.  (What kind?  I don't know, I'm not a script writer.)So now what's left to defeat the suave demons?  Enter, Buffy & Co., if the original cast is still interested.Oh and puleese, get straight on what the Bible actually says, even if you don't believe in it.  The real demon story in there is light-years scarier and more dramatic than any Christian even knows, than any film/series has ever told.  Leave out the 'devil's baby' nonsense in The Devil's Advocate, but take your cue from Al Pacino's soliloquy at the end.  That came somewhat close to the real fight going on, per 2Cor10:5, Ephesians 6.  It's a headgame.  Battle inside the soul, same battle as in Genesis 3, do you choose God over people, vox populi being the greatest evil weapon.Okay, maybe this idea for the sequel is too scary.  I recant.

563970,A1TR0WPC93BEC8,B00005221I,"Brendan L. Agnew ""rothwyn""","[3, 3]","For years, I was very very stupid about this series. I was certain that the movie was far superior (told you I was stupid), and that changing anything about it for the series was a mistake. Not only was I stupid, but I was wrong.My experience with Buffy came in small doses, which got bigger and bigger eventually. It wasn't until the full series was put into syndication that I got to watch it to my heart's content. There is no doubt that this show ranks as one of the best ever aired on any station.Welcome to Sunnydale. Population: Dwindling. Buffy Summers comes to this sunny little California town fresh from some bad raps in LA. Branded by mother and school faculty as a trouble-maker, along with having to make new friends and all, you'd think her troubles would be big enough. But no, she has to be the chosen one as well. Poor gal.The first season was only twelve episodes long, but they were all worth the watch. They managed to introduce and develop the cast of characters, from Buffy's friends Xander and Willow; to their resident bully; Cordelia; the vampire with a soul, Angel; to his exhaultant fogeyness, Ruper Giles, Buffy's Watcher. All the characters add something to the story (yes, even Cordelia, but not a whole lot), and they provide equal doses of laughs and drama.That's really what the show boils down to. It's a story of supernatural struggles wrapped in a comedy package with a healthy dose of good teen drama. None of it feels contrived or boring, and the cast and crew all obviously have a good time with it. From the first scene of the pilot to the final battle with The Master, you'll be wanting to see more Buffy, more fighting, and even more Buffy (meow!)The DVD features some respectable extras, and solid audio and video, especially for a TV series.

563971,A3KMTOFTUUNFHG,B00005221I,Brett D. Cullum,"[2, 2]","This is where it all began!  The first time we get to see Buffy, Giles, Willow, Xander, Angel and Cordelia.  It's amazing to see the beginning of their relationships, and the first glimpses into a world that would last 7 seasons.  The special effects weren't as refined, the picture quality was a little less, and there were only 12 episodes to this first season.  But the humor and wit were here, the heartbreak, and a good hero's adventure begins!  Buffy Summers moves to Sunnydale with her single mom to start a new life - hopefully a vampire-free one.  But Sunnydale sits on a Hellmouth, so it attracts vampires and any number of demonic beasts hellbent on world destruction.  She's gonna need a whole team of friends and a mentor to help her!  It's a great first glimpse into the Slayer's world.Oddly enough the first season was almost entirely shot on location rather than on sets.  So the graveyard is enormous and really spooky!  The high school looks impressive, and Sunnydale seems very real.  The vampires look a little different as they play with the make-up as the series goes on, and the dusting effects are a little primitive in this season.  But the first cut is always the deepest, and this season really sets the stage for everything to come!  Buffy is an amazing show with a female hero who relies on others to help her keep the demons at bay.  At its core the show is about growing up, and how high school can be hell.  Especially if you feel like an outsider - not quite fitting in to the mainstream.  Beautifully written and well-acted the show set action/horror cliches on their head and made it cool to be a strong girl who can kick butt and still get her heartbroken!  Buffy is a hero because we can relate to her.  She hurts as much as we do even if she's a little stronger physically.Joss Wheedon (series creator and head writer) gives commentary on the premiere episodes and discusses how and why the series came about.  You also get interviews with him and David Boreanaz (Angel) talking about the series in video clips initially produced for the VHS series that came out starting in 1997.  You get the pilot's script and some photos as well.  Collectors need this set, and newcomers should start with this one.  Debate rages on which is the BEST season, but this is the first and thus absolutely crucial no matter what your opinion on where it ranks among the 7.",5,Into every generation a SLAYER is BORN,1089158400,"07 7, 2004",2004,2392,"['where', 'began', 'first', 'time', 'get', 'see', 'Buffy', 'Giles', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'Angel', 'Cordelia', 'amazing', 'see', 'beginning', 'relationships', 'first', 'world', 'would', 'last', '7', 'seasons', 'special', 'effects', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'refined', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'little', 'less', 'were', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'humor', 'wit', 'were', 'here', 'heartbreak', 'good', 'hero', 'adventure', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'Sunnydale', 'single', 'mom', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'hopefully', 'vampire-free', 'one', 'Sunnydale', 'Hellmouth', 'vampires', 'number', 'demonic', 'beasts', 'hellbent', 'world', 'destruction', 'gon', 'need', 'whole', 'team', 'friends', 'mentor', 'help', 'great', 'first', 'glimpse', 'Slayer', 'world.Oddly', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'almost', 'entirely', 'shot', 'location', 'rather', 'sets', 'graveyard', 'enormous', 'really', 'spooky', 'high', 'school', 'looks', 'impressive', 'Sunnydale', 'very', 'real', 'vampires', 'look', 'little', 'different', 'play', 'make-up', 'series', 'dusting', 'effects', 'are', 'little', 'primitive', 'season', 'first', 'cut', 'always', 'deepest', 'season', 'really', 'stage', 'everything', 'come', 'Buffy', 'amazing', 'show', 'female', 'hero', 'who', 'others', 'help', 'keep', 'demons', 'bay', 'core', 'show', 'growing', 'up', 'how', 'high', 'school', 'can', 'be', 'hell', 'Especially', 'feel', 'outsider', 'not', 'quite', 'fitting', 'mainstream', 'Beautifully', 'written', 'well-acted', 'show', 'set', 'action/horror', 'cliches', 'head', 'made', 'cool', 'be', 'strong', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'kick', 'butt', 'still', 'get', 'heartbroken', 'Buffy', 'hero', 'can', 'relate', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'even', 'little', 'stronger', 'Wheedon', 'series', 'creator', 'head', 'writer', 'commentary', 'premiere', 'episodes', 'how', 'why', 'series', 'came', 'about', 'also', 'get', 'interviews', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Angel', 'talking', 'series', 'video', 'clips', 'initially', 'produced', 'VHS', 'series', 'came', 'out', 'starting', '1997', 'get', 'pilot', 'script', 'photos', 'as', 'well', 'Collectors', 'need', 'set', 'newcomers', 'should', 'start', 'one', 'Debate', 'rages', 'BEST', 'season', 'first', 'thus', 'absolutely', 'crucial', 'matter', 'what', 'opinion', 'where', '7']",N/A
563972,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B00005221I,Brian C.,"[0, 0]","There are already a lot of excellent reviews for this show, and this show has been around long enough for it to have seeped into the collective consciousness. Most people already know about this show and have already formed an opinion. I am writing this review for two reasons. First, I recently decided to re-watch this series (I watched it for the first time a number of years ago) and I was struck by the high quality of writing and I wanted to add my voice to the chorus of praise surrounding the show. Second, I am definitely not the demographic audience for this show. I am a thirty year old man and I have no particular interest in the supernatural, vampires, witchcraft, or high school dramas. I was reluctant to even try this show but the writing turned out to be good enough to transcend my genuine lack of interest in the genre. So I would like to encourage others who feel they might be outside the intended demographic of this show to give it a try.There are a number of reasons that this show stands out from the pack. First, as I have already mentioned, is the writing. Most shows like this tend to suffer from what I think are three major flaws in the writing department. First, the characters tend to be cliched and virtually interchangeable with one another. Every character in this show is fully developed and has their own important place in the overall economy of the show. They are not just interchangeable pawns. They are each like puzzle pieces and only when they are all added together do you get a genuine picture. If you subtracted one of them the show would no longer be as strong. That is really hard to do. To develop a genuine ensemble in which each part is as important and interesting as all the others. This show achieved that brilliantly, and it avoids cliche. Cordelia, for example, starts out as sort of the cliched popular girl, but as the show progresses, she becomes an interesting character in her own right.Second, the dialogue in most shows like this tends to be bland and repetitive. Shows like this tend to have characters who get into the same arguments over and over and over. It feels like the writers need filler so they just transplant the same argument from episode to episode. Plus, the humor tends to be bland. The dialogue in this show is way above the standard. The humor is actually funny. I find myself laughing out loud in almost every episode and I never feel like the writers are just throwing filler dialogue in because they have nothing better to say. There are times when the dialogue can get a little corny but there are also some really brilliant speeches delivered by various characters throughout the run of the show. A lot of the speeches have genuine substance, and the verbal repartee that often takes place between characters is usually far more clever than the average.Third, most of these shows lack a genuine connection to real life. The writing fails to connect to universal themes. Whether people realize it or not, I think the primary reason that this show was as popular as it was, is because people recognized that it was dealing with universal themes that related to their own lives. That can be very difficult to do in a show about the supernatural. The premise of the show is that Buffy is literally ""the chosen one"". She is supposed to be unique, and yet, somehow her struggles come to mirror everyone's struggles. I imagine that teenage girls in particular will identify with Buffy. Probably more than a thirty year old man anyways, but despite the difference between Buffy and I in age and gender, I still feel like this show connected with my own life. I saw a Joss Whedon interview where he talked about how traumatic high school was for him and how he feels like he will be carrying scars around from that period for the rest of his life. That is one of the primary themes of this show (the first few seasons anyways) and I think a lot of people can relate to that.This show was successful in portraying the way that high school actually felt for a lot of people and it succeeded in giving a much more realistic portrayal than previous shows. Buffy is constantly trying to juggle her school work, her social life, and her family life, while spending her evenings fighting demons, a particularly apt metaphor, in my opinion. High school is often a time period when our own personal demons start to make an appearance and it can be very difficult to deal with all of that while still trying to maintain a normal life. High school is also a time when we try to figure out who we are, and sometimes we do not like who we are, and it takes awhile to accept ourselves. All of that is dramatized very well in this show. Even though this show is about supernatural fantasy creatures, it is also, in my opinion, one of the most realistic shows ever made.The show also hits the sweet spot in terms of narrative structure. Each season has an overarching story line, but the episodes that deal with that story line alternate with more stand alone episodes. Shows seem to have a really hard time finding that sweet spot. When shows lack any overarching story line I tend to get bored eventually, but in some shows the overarching story line comes to usurp the stand alone episodes, and I get bored with that as well. This show strikes the perfect balance, in my opinion. The acting is also superb. There is a reason that such a high percentage of the actors and actresses in this show went on to bigger and better things. It seems like a television show like this is often the beginning and end of an actor or actresses career. Joss Whedon, or whoever was in charge of the casting, did an excellent job casting each character. The great writing would have fallen flat without quality actors and actresses to deliver it.The show has what I would consider a few minor flaws. Sometimes it is a little bit too sappy for me. The show is dealing with high school emotions so that is, perhaps, unavoidable. There are also genuine moments of emotional truth, though, so it balances out. I am willing to forgive the sappiness because, sometimes, I think they get the emotions just right, which is rare. There are also a few moments in the first season where the special effects sort of pull you out of the show. Apparently, they had a really low budget for the first season. There were a few times where I was pulled out of the show with the thought ""That looked weird"". But that is ultimately a very minor flaw, and it becomes less of a problem as the show progresses. Ultimately, I think this is one of the better shows I have watched. It is one of the only shows that I have decided to watch again from start to finish. So that is saying something.",5,Show about the supernatural dealing with universal themes...,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,6717,"['are', 'already', 'lot', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'show', 'show',

563977,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,B00005221I,Bruce Rux,"[11, 14]","There are so many reasons to watch Buffy, it's impossible to list them in a brief precis:  epic scope, mythic resonance, a completely believable variety of diverse characters, witty scripts, sparkling dialogue, wonderfully realized performances, and even a legitimate scare, here and there, along the way.Every season has its own feel and flavor, and its own self-contained story arc.  The first season, needless to say, introduced all the basic characters and situations, emphasizing humor, courage and loyalty.  The Order of Aurelius, headed by the arch-vampire known as The Master, was Buffy's Season One trial, though it properly only covered half the total number of episodes, the rest being filled out by ""incidental"" horrors of the Hellmouth, where the supernatural manifests itself more than in most places of the world.Against The Master and his sinister, apocalyptic vampire Order, are:  Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the born ""Slayer,"" whose dharma is to be the one girl in all the world equipped from birth with the strength and stamina to thin-out the vampire ranks and prevent their overrunning the world; her watcher, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), an introverted British bookworm and surrogate father, whose knowledge and training are invaluable to Buffy; Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), a good-hearted unlucky social loser but pithily witty analyst, whose love and loyalty to Buffy elevate him to the rank of unsung hero/helpmeet; and Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan), a scholarly computer nerd and gentle soul of great innate wisdom.Added assistance are provided by Angel (David Boreanaz), the vampire with a restored soul who becomes the great love of Buffy's life, and reluctant sometime-helper Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), the most pathologically self-absorbed beauty queen on campus.The balance of horror and humor in the first season is very well managed, and the cast click together with remarkable chemistry and joie de vivre.  The only flaw in these early episodes is the sometimes laughably low budget, though the show beautifully compensates with clever theatrical tricks, the most notable of which is making the underground Order of Aurelius appear much larger and more populated than it is by the use of a multitude of candles and limbo lighting.The best way to get into the magic that is Buffy is from the beginning  -  and this is it.",4,Beginning the Mythic Journey,1021334400,"05 14, 2002",2002,2393,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'watch', 'Buffy', 'impossible', 'list', 'brief', 'precis', 'epic', 'scope', 'mythic', 'resonance', 'completely', 'believable', 'variety', 'diverse', 'characters', 'witty', 'scripts', 'sparkling', 'dialogue', 'wonderfully', 'realized', 'performances', 'even', 'legitimate', 'scare', 'here', 'there', 'way.Every', 'season', 'own', 'feel', 'flavor', 'own', 'self-contained', 'story', 'arc', 'first', 'season', 'needless', 'say', 'introduced', 'basic', 'characters', 'situations', 'emphasizing', 'humor', 'courage', 'loyalty', 'Order', 'Aurelius', 'headed', 'arch-vampire', 'known', 'Master', 'was', 'Buffy', 'Season', 'One', 'trial', 'properly', 'only', 'covered', 'total', 'number', 'episodes', 'rest', 'being', 'filled', 'out', 'incidental', 'horrors', 'Hellmouth', 'where', 'supernatural', 'manifests', 'more', 'most', 'places', 'world.Against', 'Master', 'sinister', 'apocalyptic', 'vampire', 'Order', 'are', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'born', 'Slayer', 'dharma', 'be', 'one', 'girl', 'world', 'equipped', 'birth', 'strength', 'stamina', 'thin-out', 'vampire', 'ranks', 'prevent', 'overrunning', 'world', 'watcher', 'Rupert', 'Giles', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'introverted', 'British', 'bookworm', 'surrogate', 'father', 'knowledge', 'training', 'are', 'invaluable', 'Buffy', 'Xander', 'Harris', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'good-hearted', 'unlucky', 'social', 'loser', 'pithily', 'witty', 'analyst', 'love', 'loyalty', 'Buffy', 'elevate', 'rank', 'unsung', 'hero/helpmeet', 'Willow', 'Rosenberg', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'scholarly', 'computer', 'nerd', 'gentle', 'soul', 'great', 'innate', 'wisdom.Added', 'assistance', 'are', 'provided', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'vampire', 'restored', 'soul', 'who', 'great', 'love', 'Buffy', 'life', 'reluctant', 'sometime-helper', 'Cordelia', 'Chase', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'most', 'pathologically', 'self-absorbed', 'beauty', 'queen', 'campus.The', 'balance', 'horror', 'humor', 'first', 'season', 'very', 'well', 'managed', 'cast', 'click', 'together', 'remarkable', 'chemistry', 'joie', 'de', 'vivre', 'only', 'flaw', 'early', 'episodes', 'sometimes', 'laughably', 'low', 'budget', 'show', 'beautifully', 'clever', 'theatrical', 'tricks', 'most', 'notable', 'making', 'underground', 'Order', 'Aurelius', 'appear', 'much', 'larger', 'more', 'populated', 'use', 'multitude', 'candles', 'limbo', 'lighting.The', 'best', 'way', 'get', 'magic', 'Buffy', 'beginning']",N/A

I was debating on 4 or 5 stars, because it isn't the best Buffy season, but it's really good! 4.5 stars I would give it, but that's not an option! So, I'll just give it as much help as it needs! Here's what I think of each episode:Welcome To Hellmouth: 9.5/10 One of the best episodes in the season, really well acted, and done nearly perfect!The Harvest: 10/10 The sequel to the first two episodes ever made, and it's made slightly better then the 1st. I loved it!! Really done well by Sarah!Witch: 8.5/10 Amy comes into this one, I don't like her much, just to say and I'm glad she didn't turn into a regular! Really interesting one though, and also very funny because Buffy joins the cheerleading squad!Teacher's Pet: 9/10 There's a hot substitute that Xander and the rest of the guys fall in love with. the actual science teacher was killed, but by what?Never Kill A Boy On The First Date: 8.5/10 Not bad, brings in a new guy who dances with Buffy, makes Cordelia jealous and then finds out what Buffy's life is really like, and goodbye!The Pack: 9/10 Xander turns into a Hyena as well as a group of kids that he hates. Pretty cool episode!Angel: 8/10 I'm one of those who doesn't care too much about Angel, he's too moody most of time and doesn't bring too much delight, unlike Buffy! But he's supposed to be that way, so I except him! And despite Angel being the centre of attention, this episode turned out pretty good!I Robot... You Jane: 9.5/10 Scary, a demon named Moloch gets trapped into a computer! He makes everyone love him, especially Willow because she brought him back to life, from a book!!The Puppet Show: 9.5/10 I really enjoyed this one, and the end is so funny when the put on the show! Buffy, Xander and Willow doing a talent show, funny!! Where as the puppet, what's with it? is it a killer or not, you'll be surprised when you find out what he really is!!Nightmares: 10/10 A kid named Billy gets nightmares become real! Very scary and Buffy even dies and shows her vampire face in this one, only, it's not reality so it doesn't count!Out Of Mind, Out of Sight: 9.5/10 A girl is invisible to everyone, so she becomes invisible and starts attacking everyone close to Cordelia! Then her! Really cool episode where you finally see Buffy on Cordelia's side, for the 1st time!Prophecy Girl: 9.5/10 Not as good as the other season finally's, only finally done worse was the 4th season's, that would still get about 8.5 or 9 out of 10. Buffy goes out to defeat the Master from opening the Hell mouth. Will she fail or succeed, well, either way, you don't give up!The bonus features: 8/10 All you get is Joss Whedon explaining half of the episodes, not really good, but it's good enough as it has a photo section, of about 10 to 15 pictures.This season wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst. None of the episodes really stood out, like other seasons, but it was acted very well, and some were really funny! Really hand it to Buffy for this season! Willow, Xander, Cordelia and Giles also delivered fairly good humour and you get introduced to the new principle, who gets swallowed by the mayor at the end of season 3, thankfully!!

563982,A1EYS0SF2CWUQJ,B00005221I,"Buffy ""topaz@shaka.com""","[1, 1]","The only downside to the first season of ""Buffy"" is that it's only 12 episodes long. Other than the fact that it's too short, the first season is a wonderful introduction to what would become one of the most original and well-written series in the history of television. This DVD set is a must-have as it introduces us to the wonderful world of ""Buffy"", it's lovable characters and witty dialogue. The series begins with the main characters in their sophomore year of high school. Buffy has just transferred to Sunnydale High after being kicked out of her school in L.A. for her 'violent behavior', which no one realizes is actually Buffy taking on her Slayer duties and protecting others from the threat of vampires. Upon transferring, Buffy has decided that she's had enough of the Slayer life and is determined to put it behind her. Little does she know that Sunnydale High sits right atop a hellmouth and that her being sent there is no coincidence. She goes on to make friends with Willow, a shy, geeky 'computer nerd' and Xander, a sweet, goofy sort of guy who harbors a major crush on Buffy. The cast also includes Giles, the school librarian, who is Buffy's Watcher, responsible for training Buffy both physically and mentally in her Slayer duties (and who will become an important father figure to Buffy), and Cordelia, the stereotypical popular girl in school who has a love/hate relationship w/ the gang and always seems to find herself right in the middle of their often gory situations. The mysterious Angel, who we meet in the first episode, will play a very important role in the show, but he does not become a series regular until the second season. The first season of ""Buffy"" is more on the light-hearted side than the seasons that follow. The villians they face won't pose as much of a challenge as the ones they'll face in the future and their lives aren't nearly as complicated quite yet. However, the season finale sets the perfect tone for what the show will become. Stand out episodes are the pilot ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"", ""The Harvest"", ""The Pack"", ""Angel"" and the finale ""Prophecy Girl"".

563983,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B00005221I,Busy Body,"[5, 6]","Season 1 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is excellent, but I still do not consider it worthy of the title of ""one of the best Buffy seasons"" because it simply isn't. For a start there are a total of 12 episodes in Season 1 compared to the 22 in all the other Buffy seasons. Secondly, there isn't a lot of character development, most of which comes later on in the splendid Season 2. Thirdly, 20th Century Fox gave Joss Whedon a limited budget on which to film 12 episodes, making most episodes rather poor in sound quality, picture quality and special effects. Despite these few let-downs the season in terms of scripts, humour and character personality is absolutely excellent. Anyway, I'll get on with my review...Season 1 starts with a brilliant two-parter season opener in the form of Welcome To The Hellmouth and The Harvest. Both episodes were first broadcast on March 10th 1997 in the US to great critical acclaim. Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her mum Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) have moved from Los Angeles to Sunnydale, California. Buffy ""fell in with the wrong crowd"" and burned down the gym. What everyone doesn't know is that Buffy was trying to kill some vampires; she found out she was to be the Slayer before coming to Sunnydale. Figuring her Slaying days are far behind her, she hopes to make a fresh start at Sunnydale High School. On her first day, she makes friends with Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) - a nerdy, unpopular, computer whizz-kid with a heart of gold and a personality to make anyone who encounters her turn to slush! She also meets Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) who is the best friend of Willow. She is also introduced to Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), who is kind to her on her first day at school. ""If you hang with me and mine, you'll be accepted in no time,"" she proudly states to Buffy. It's clear that Cordelia is obssessed with being popular and loved by everyone. But after Cordelia sees Buffy hanging around with Willow and Xander, she turns on her - spreading rumors about her that last up until the end of the season. Buffy also meets up with the school librarian, Mr Giles (Anthony Stewart-Head) who has secretly been sent to Sunnydale by the Watcher's Council in England to be the Watcher of a new Slayer. To Buffy, he's annoying - ""a textbook with arms."" He knows Buffy is the Slayer, yet she won't accept this. ""Yeah, and I've both been there and done that and I'm moving on,"" she says. After Willow is snatched by a vampire, Buffy knows she must find her. Her Slayer instincts are instantly stirred and from then on, she realises being the Slayer is her duty. From then on, Buffy and the Scooby Gang (Willow/Xander/Giles) hunt the demons and vampires. Other top episodes include Witch, Teacher's Pet, The Pack, Angel, Nightmares and Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight. All the episodes have fantastic dialogue, witty one-liners and exciting storylines. This perfect combination is very hard to get right, but Buffy the Vampire Slayer manages to get it spot-on.The seasons' main story arc focuses on the vampire legend, as does the second season. Yet Seasons 3, 4, 5 and 6 didn't really focus on Big Bad's of the non-vampire variety. The Master (Mark Metcalf) is a very powerful vampire that is stuck in between Hell and Earth who is desperate to get free and rule over the world. He makes many attempts to get free in episodes such as The Harvest, Never Kill A Boy On The First Date among others. In the season opener, we meet Angel (David Boreanaz). For the first seven episodes he is know by the Scooby Gang as Mysterious Guy. He's never around through the day, has pale skin and seems to know a lot about vampires - some would say a little to much. In the episode Angel, Buffy finds out he's a vampire. The one guy she's had a crush on is a vampire. Angel is a vampire with a soul and hasn't killed a human for years since his soul was restored. Amazingly, the two start to see each other in Season 2 but for Season 1 they mainly work together with Willow, Xander and Giles. In the episode I, Robot...You Jane, we are introduced to Jenny Calendar. She is an I.T. teacher at Sunnydale High School and features in the season finale Prophecy Girl. In the fianle, the Master is freed from his prison between Hell and Earth. Buffy and the Scoobies spend the most of the season looking for where the Hellmouth is - they realise the Hellmouth is situated directly underneath the School Libary. So Buffy, Willow, Xander, Giles, Angel, Cordelia and Ms Calendar work together in a spectacular display of teamwork and determination to save the day...OVERALL GRADE: 10/10All in all, Season 1 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is essential for every fan. This TV show is legendary and these 12 episodes are absolute gems for everyone to treasure. The episodes are brilliant and you can watch them over and over again.

563988,A1C5KB7EJYT8Q9,B00005221I,"""c_e_l_e_b_r_i_t_y""","[7, 8]","When the kids of Sunnydale High meet new comer Buffy Summers, they write her off as another perky blonde with a smart mouth that likes to get into trouble. What they don't know is that when school's over, while most kids her age are out dating, going to football games and having fun with their peers, she's out saving the world from an impending doom known as the Hellmouth.This basically sets the tone of the show. While most people threw their noses up at it's premise (including me at first), the small audience that began watching it were treated to something unlike anything else. A tv show that dealt with tough issues head on using metaphors along the way. Buffy wasn't just some sunny haired airhead saving the world on a weekly basis, she was deep. She faced problems and challenges that all teens go through plus some. It's the plus some that made the show such a hit. Tv shows like Dawson's Creek and 90210 never seemed to quite get it like BTVS did. We all have problems, but with Buffy, she had the weight of the world on her shoulders - literally - and that's pretty much what alot of teens feel like.The show featured many characters that we all have come to know and love such as the kind hearted computer nerd Willow, the geeky and sarcastic Xander, the seemingly evil and selfish cheerleader Cordelia, the bad boy that we weren't supposed to fall for, but couldn't help swooning over, Angel and the wise beyond his years watcher Mr. Giles who not only served as a source of guidance, but also as a friend.These characters now have a special place inside all of our hearts, because they touch us and we can relate to them. Everyone knows someone who helps them through life's toughest battles just as these characters aided Buffy through her problems. And although she doesn't win every fight, she always makes it through and back in 1997 when the show was airing, that was something us teens didn't get to see. That is why Buffy has become such an icon for people around the world.Not only does the show connect with it's audience, but the show really is good. That may be an opinion, but it's many people's opinion. Many critics have kept BTVS on their Top 5 Favorite Shows Of The Year list since it began. The dialogue is witty, refreshing and to this day still stands to be original. The acting is top notch with everyone turning in a fine performance as always. The actors seem born to play these roles. The storylines are great. There's alot of building plotlines for the future that set the foundation for what's to come.Overall the first season was a great one that had a spooky Twilight Zone feel to it. The monsters and demons all looked great from week to week.

563989,A2H3TGP5WIJNHK,B00005221I,"Center Man ""centerman@aol.com""","[8, 9]","This isn't a bad purchase at all.  And, if you're like me and got acquainted with Buffy through another friend's DVDs (a few days after the show ended), you quickly get a sense of why the show was so compelling.  The central characters are already well-developed, and the Master, the show's first ""Big Bad,"" is both scary and strangely endearing.  There are also some very funny moments (especially in ""The Puppet Show"") and Buffy's resistance to her calling feels right.But the Amazon reviewer wasn't kidding when he called this ""Buffy 90210.""  You could also dub the season ""Buffy's Creek,"" or even ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the Cosby Kids:"" there are a lot of ""educational"" themes in this season, whether it's the pressure kids can face from their parents, the pain of social invisibility, or the casual cruelty high schoolers can inflict on one another.Granted, it's all presented in a fantasy framework, but the consciousness-raising crashes through the show's growing mythology in a ham-fisted way.  You half expect to see Giles sitting on a stool and holding up a brochure at the end of a few episodes: ""If you'd like to talk to your teen about praying mantis intimacy, write to Keep Your Head On, P.O. Box 6339, Boulder, CO.""  The writers of the show later learned showing the pain of high school could be best accomplished by fleshing the characters out and watching them interact.  They sometimes reach that level in this season, especially with the depiction of the Buffy-Xander-Willow love triangle.  For the most part, though, the staff trusts the issues more than the characters, and it leaves the whole high school element of the show a bit hollow.But there are a handful of great moments.  The aforementioned ""Puppet Show"" has an amusing twist on the haunted dummy theme, and ends with Buffy, Xander and Willow hilariously stumbling through a scene from the tragedy of Oedipus.  ""Nightmares"" marks the series' first use of dreams as a way of revealing its characters' inner psyches, with the perfect blend of humor and poignancy ""Buffy"" would make routine in following seasons.  And ""Prophecy Girl,"" where Buffy confronts the Master, is a masterpiece, a terrifically told story that neatly sums up the previous season and sets the stage for the next one.But few episodes show the workmanship of those episodes, either taking a silly idea and running it into the ground (""The Pack,"" where Xander turns into a hyena) or ruining a decent episode with an unbelievable ending (""Out of Sight, Out of Mind"").  In this season, ""Buffy"" is very much a work in progress.That doesn't mean it's bad; the show was just on the cusp of getting much better.  Newcomers should try Season 2, which becomes transcendant television almost from the get-go.  The central cast really comes to life in that season, and you won't miss anything if you skip this one.

563992,AYXZU81PMZBKC,B00005221I,"Christopher Wood ""anima300""","[3, 5]","What started out as a replacement show, ended up being one of the greatest cult shows of all time, along with Angel and The X Files.  I am unsure how many of you remember these episodes, or how many of you would even consider watching the show.  Perhaps it's my job to make sure that you do watch one of the greatest television shows of all time, whether you like fantasy or not.  In retrospect, it's just an adequate season, given the wonder that is to come in later seasons, and that season one is abbreviated.  But, if one is to get themselves into a show that has been off the air now for seven years, you have to start at the beginning.  Everything about this season says beginning.Now, that being said, the greatest part of this season is the characters.  From start to finish, we get to know them, their quirks and idiosyncrasies, personalities, and strengths and weaknesses.  In that, is the strength of the show anyways.  But the weaknesses of this particular season are within other things.First off is the quality.  One would think the transfer to DVD would have been much better, but it's grainy, and really sub-par as far as production goes.  And the filler episodes, as far as plot goes, are rather pedestrian.  But, as for most things that I like, the good always outweighs the bad.  Second would be plot weakness, but there are enough good plots to make it manageable.Below are my episode ratings and a small blurb.1.  Welcome to the Hellmouth (1 of 2):  Good start, good introductions.  7/102.  The Harvest (2 of 2):  Good ending to the pilot two-parter, dwarfed by other episodes similar to it.  7/103.  Witch:  First stand-alone episode.  First dabbling of witchcraft.  Really great, honestly.  8/104.  Teacher's Pet:  Generic monster stand-alone.  Nice use of Xander and Cordelia.  Stupid everything else.  6/105.  Never Kill a Boy On the First Date:  The next step for the season arc.  Buffy's true beginning.  Very good.  7/106.  The Pack:  Frustrated with lack of continuity, but another great stand-alone.  Xander is great again.  7.5/107.  Angel:  Great expose into Angel's character, and his relationship with Buffy.  Great job all-around.  8.5/108.  I Robot, You Jane:  Worst of the season.  Nice to see a desperate side of Willow, and good for the introduction of Jenny Calendar.

These are the days when Buffy was closer to The X-Files estructure (standalones or monsters of the week and vampire related episodes). The truth about this series is that all previous judgements about the title or the genre are misleading. This is a darn good show that, just like X-Files, works at an enormous range of levels (psicology, mythology, allegoric, socilogy, etc). But all that is nothing if you are not really entertained... and with BUFFY you are really entertained. This season brings BUFFY to a californian town called Sunnydale, which turns out to be the hellmouth. Therefore all sorts of evil forces and creatures converge in this little city full of scared people... I love this aspect of the series (hey! I'm live in Colombia and from what always appears on the news, sometimes it seems like everyone thinks I live in the hellmouth -and I don't-). She is joined by a nerd (Willow, played by Alison Hannigan), a normal guy who tries to fit in his school (Xander played by Nicholas Brendon) and a brittish librarian (Giles played by Anthony Stewart Head). The entire season is based upon a specific threat that comes to reality in the final episode (Prophecy Girl): a very old and powerful vampire who is trapped between dimensions wants to go back to earth. The mixture of humor, horror and action is well achieved. The music could be better, but this is, overall, a very good season... it is worth the time. I was particularly surprised when in the episode ""The Pack"" a bunch of teens possesed by hienas eat principal Fluttie... then I realized: this series is willing to go all the way. And it has really gone all the way in this six years.In this season we also begin to know Angel and his background... I have never been a fan of this character (I think Buffy could do so much better than this old tortured, misterious guy... she should be with a lighter person, someone who just can wait her at home, and when she gets there about three o'clock in the morning says: ""hi, hon, how was the slaying tonight?"") but I have to admit that his dramatic impact is powerful.I have to be honest, I expected much more from the DVD box. The booklet is simple and the box has no real taste. The extras, in the other hand, are pretty good... the script is a good option although I have never been able to read the whole thing because I hate to read long things on a screen. The interviews with Whedon and Boreanaz are ok, but where is the rest of the cast?Anyways, this is a very good item... and it is a must-have if you are a fan of the series because... well, this is pretty much where it all started (I'd like to think that this is the begining and not the movie which I didn't like).",4,A phenomenon is born,1018915200,"04 16, 2002",2002,2804,"['Buffy', 'first', 'season', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'one', 'sure', 'taste', 'what', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'able', 'do', 'are', 'days', 'when', 'Buffy', 'was', 'closer', 'X-Files', 'estructure', 'standalones', 'monsters', 'week', 'vampire', 'related', 'episodes', 'truth', 'series', 'previous', 'judgements', 'title', 'genre', 'are', 'misleading', 'darn', 'good', 'show', 'just', 'X-Files', 'works', 'enormous', 'range', 'levels', 'psicology', 'mythology', 'allegoric', 'socilogy', 'etc', 'nothing', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'entertained', 'BUFFY', 'are', 'really', 'entertained', 'season', 'BUFFY', 'californian', 'town', 'called', 'Sunnydale', 'out', 'be', 'hellmouth', 'sorts', 'evil', 'forces', 'creatures', 'converge', 'little', 'city', 'full', 'scared', 'people', 'love', 'aspect', 'series', 'hey', ""'m"", 'live', 'Colombia', 'what', 'always', 'news', 'sometimes', 'everyone', 'live', 'hellmouth', '-and', ""don't-"", 'joined', 'nerd', 'Willow', 'played', 'Alison', 'Hannigan', 'normal', 'guy', 'who', 'fit', 'school', 'Xander', 'played', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'brittish', 'librarian', 'Giles', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'entire', 'season', 'based', 'specific', 'threat', 'reality', 'final', 'episode', 'Prophecy', 'Girl', 'very', 'old', 'powerful', 'vampire', 'who', 'trapped', 'dimensions', 'go', 'back', 'earth', 'mixture', 'humor', 'horror', 'action', 'well', 'achieved', 'music', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'season', 'time', 'was', 'particularly', 'surprised', 'when', 'episode', 'Pack', 'bunch', 'teens', 'possesed', 'hienas', 'eat', 'principal', 'Fluttie', 'then', 'realized', 'series', 'willing', 'go', 'way', 'really', 'gone', 'way', 'six', 'years.In', 'season', 'also', 'begin', 'know', 'Angel', 'background', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'character', 'think', 'Buffy', 'could', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'old', 'tortured', 'misterious', 'guy', 'should', 'be', 'lighter', 'person', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'can', 'wait', 'home', 'when', 'there', 'three', ""o'clock"", 'morning', 'hi', 'hon', 'how', 'was', 'slaying', 'tonight', 'have', 'admit', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'powerful.I', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'expected', 'much', 'more', 'DVD', 'box', 'booklet', 'simple', 'box', 'real', 'taste', 'extras', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'option', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'read', 'whole', 'thing', 'hate', 'read', 'long', 'things', 'screen', 'interviews', 'Whedon', 'Boreanaz', 'are', 'ok', 'where', 'rest', 'cast', 'Anyways', 'very', 'good', 'item', 'must-have', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'where', 'started', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'begining', 'not', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'like']",N/A

564001,A2AML5BI49ST3F,B00005221I,dangertim,"[584, 606]","For a first time screenwriter, Joss Whedon's &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; was a good effort for a feature film. I thought for sure the series was going to tank. When I started watching halfway through the first season, I quickly found that I was wrong.  &quot;Buffy&quot; simply blossoms on television. I've been hooked ever since.For the first time, Whedon has provided us with all the terrors of high school (remember those?) in a horror genre setting. Not only that, but he provides a confident, cool FEMALE character to trounce the bad guys. Whether you're a fan of the genre or a teenage feminist, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) provides a niche for the unpopular misfits in high school, but looks upon them as heroes. Were you as uncomfortable as Xander (Nicholas Brendon)? As geeky as Willow (Alyson Hannigan)? As quick with an aphorism as Oz (Seth Green)? The series proves that high school is indeed survivable no matter who you are, even if you're cliquish Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter). And in the end, the more unpopular you were - possibly the more important you were to your teenage community.Mix in your favorite teacher (or librarian) played by Anthony Stewart Head (who should play &quot;Doctor Who&quot; after he's done with &quot;Buffy&quot;) to be the requisite horror genre British pseudo-scientist, and Buffy's single mom (Kristine Sutherland)  and you're all set to go with the most intelligent sci-fi TV series possibly written for this age group. (The next closest thing being the intelligent, yet non-sf &quot;Freaks &amp; Geeks&quot;.)I'm not kidding. It's amazing how quickly these characters grow in the first season and their responses remain true to life despite the extraordinary situations they're thrown into. Creator Joss Whedon has become one of the most talented writer/directors working in the industry today, despite the fact that &quot;Buffy&quot; is most of what he's been doing for the last five years.As far as what you get in this box set, you're in for a treat. This is the full first season, not just the half previously released on VHS; including the season finale &quot;Prophecy Girl&quot; - where we see just how heroic Buffy really is, despite her adolescence and fear of death. Also present throughout the series are teenage issues of emotional/sexual conflict (&quot;Teacher's Pet&quot;) and problems with acceptance (&quot;The Pack&quot;). Specific highlights also include Whedon's commentary for the two part premiere as well as the first appearances of Angel (David Boreanaz) and Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte).Remember, Buffy's not JUST about vampires. In fact I think it's safe to say that vampires are secondary to the emotional undercurrent of the show, if not a particular episode's plot.

564002,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005221I,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[10, 13]","I am a relatively new Buffy fan starting at the beginning, with no real sense of the direction future seasons may have taken.  The first twelve episodes of Season One certainly provide a wonderful introduction to the subject at hand, succeeding fabulously even when storylines wander into really weird places.  Few television shows could grow and prosper with such plot points as a substitute teacher who is actually a giant praying mantis, a girl who takes the concept of being invisible to everyone around her much too far, and an ancient demon who comes backs to life via the Internet.  In Sunnydale, a town residing directly over the Hellmouth, anything can happen and be accepted for what it is by both the characters as well as the audience.There are many strengths to this show: Joss Whedon's vision, commitment, and talent; sharp writing by all concerned with different writers all moving seamlessly in a fictional world larger than themselves; excellent special effects; a genuinely unsettling atmosphere wrapped around a seemingly bright and sunny one; etc.  The greatest strength of the show has to be the actors, though.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is gorgeous as well as exceedingly believable in her role as the Slayer; Alyson Hannigan is captivating as the quiet, demure Willow Rosenberg; Nicholas Brendon brings an incredible amount of humor and teen-based reality to everything that happens as the Chandler Bing-ish Xander Harris; Charisma Carpenter is the quintessentially vain prom queen whose character Cordelia Chase really only begins to belie her stereotypical image toward the end of the season.  Topping them all, though, is Anthony Head in the role of Rupert Giles, the Watcher whose job it is to train and prepare Buffy in her role as the ordained Slayer.  His aura of professionalism, commitment, intelligence, and kindly authority injects a necessary dose of believability into an unbelievable world.  I'm rather ambivalent toward Angel (David Boreanaz), as I tend to share Xander's feelings of dislike for this mysterious man in Buffy's life.One feels as if one knows these characters from the very beginning, identifying a great deal with some if not all of them.  Buffy just wants to be a normal sixteen-year-old girl, sometimes resisting her destiny as the one and only Slayer standing between the world and the apocalypse.  Xander is simply brilliant and hilarious to me as the normal guy trying to deal with impossible things as well as his undisguised and unrequited love for Buffy.  Willow is the smart and geekily unpopular kid who possesses a greater strength that she realizes, pining silently over Xander in the final ring of a weird little love triangle.  Eggheads like me, of course, celebrate the efforts of the scholarly Giles and identify with many of his old-school feelings and arguments.  It is not often that we are blessed with a librarian hero.Season One has two dimensions to it.  First, it lays out the vague history of Sunnydale's newest student Buffy Summers, introduces the responsibilities and functions of the foreordained Slayer, and exposes us to a wide cross-section of the dangerous monsters that one would expect to converge on a place referred to as the Hellmouth.  Second, it assembles Buffy and her gang of friends into the first dream team of vampire slaying and other miscellaneous demonic extermination.  Buffy does most of the work, of course, but everyone plays a part in thwarting the incredibly threatening things that seem to rise up continuously in a town somehow still referred to as dull and boring.  At this time in Buffy's slaying career, her enemy is the ancient vampire named the Master; his attempts to free himself from his underground tomb and return to the surface serve as the backdrop of most of the major action of the season, leading up to a direct confrontation between him and Buffy in the final episode.Perhaps no other show on television has given us so many great zingers and one-line catch phrases, digging deeply into the world of popular culture.  It also provides an impressively realistic look at youth and some of the issues young people confront in the normal, non-vampire world.  Buffy is about much more than slaying vampires, vanquishing demons, and the like.  Buffy, Xander, and Willow in particular deal with problems each of us have faced before alongside the type of evil threats that can be found only in Sunnydale, and it is this aspect of the show that truly connects with many of its fans.",5,Not since Van Helsing has vampire slaying been this hip,1057968000,"07 12, 2003",2003,4497,"['am', 'relatively', 'new', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'starting', 'beginning', 'real', 'sense', 'direction', 'future', 'seasons', 'may', 'have', 'taken', 'first', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One', 'certainly', 'wonderful', 'introduction', 'subject', 'hand', 'succeeding', 'fabulously', 'even', 'when', 'storylines', 'wander', 'really', 'weird', 'places', 'Few', 'television', 'shows', 'could', 'grow', 'prosper', 'such', 'plot', 'points', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'who', 'actually', 'giant', 'praying', 'mantis', 'girl', 'who', 'concept', 'being', 'invisible', 'everyone', 'much', 'too', 'far', 'ancient', 'demon', 'who', 'backs', 'life', 'Internet', 'Sunnydale', 'town', 'residing', 'directly', 'Hellmouth', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'be', 'accepted', 'what', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'many', 'strengths', 'show', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'vision', 'commitment', 'talent', 'sharp', 'writing', 'concerned', 'different', 'writers', 'moving', 'seamlessly', 'fictional', 'world', 'larger', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', 'genuinely', 'unsettling', 'atmosphere', 'wrapped', 'seemingly', 'bright', 'sunny', 'one', 'etc', 'greatest', 'strength', 'show', 'be', 'actors', 'though', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'gorgeous', 'as', 'well', 'exceedingly', 'believable', 'role', 'Slayer', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'captivating', 'quiet', 'demure', 'Willow', 'Rosenberg', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'incredible', 'amount', 'humor', 'teen-based', 'reality', 'everything', 'Chandler', 'Bing-ish', 'Xander', 'Harris', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'quintessentially', 'vain', 'prom', 'queen', 'character', 'Cordelia', 'Chase', 'really', 'only', 'belie', 'stereotypical', 'image', 'end', 'season', 'Topping', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'role', 'Rupert', 'Giles', 'Watcher', 'job', 'train', 'prepare', 'Buffy', 'role', 'ordained', 'Slayer', 'aura', 'professionalism', 'commitment', 'intelligence', 'kindly', 'authority', 'necessary', 'dose', 'believability', 'unbelievable', 'world', ""'m"", 'rather', 'ambivalent', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'tend', 'share', 'Xander', 'feelings', 'dislike', 'mysterious', 'man', 'Buffy', 'life.One', 'feels', 'one', 'characters', 'very', 'beginning', 'identifying', 'great', 'deal', 'not', 'Buffy', 'just', 'be', 'normal', 'sixteen-year-old', 'girl', 'sometimes', 'resisting', 'destiny', 'one', 'only', 'Slayer', 'standing', 'world', 'apocalypse', 'Xander', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'hilarious', 'normal', 'guy', 'trying', 'deal', 'impossible', 'things', 'as', 'well', 'undisguised', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Buffy', 'Willow', 'smart', 'geekily', 'unpopular', 'kid', 'who', 'greater', 'strength', 'pining', 'silently', 'Xander', 'final', 'ring', 'weird', 'little', 'love', 'triangle', 'Eggheads', 'course', 'celebrate', 'efforts', 'scholarly', 'Giles', 'identify', 'many', 'old-school', 'feelings', 'arguments', 'not', 'often', 'are', 'blessed', 'librarian', 'hero.Season', 'One', 'two', 'dimensions', 'First', 'out', 'vague', 'history', 'Sunnydale', 'newest', 'student', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'responsibilities', 'functions', 'foreordained', 'Slayer', 'wide', 'cross-section', 'dangerous', 'monsters', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'converge', 'place', 'referred', 'Hellmouth', 'Second', 'Buffy', 'gang', 'friends', 'first', 'dream', 'team', 'vampire', 'slaying', 'other', 'miscellaneous', 'demonic', 'extermination', 'Buffy', 'most', 'work', 'course', 'everyone', 'part', 'thwarting', 'incredibly', 'threatening', 'things', 'seem', 'rise', 'up', 'continuously', 'town', 'somehow', 'still', 'referred', 'dull', 'boring', 'time', 'Buffy', 'slaying', 'career', 'enemy', 'ancient', 'vampire', 'named', 'Master', 'attempts', 'free', 'underground', 'tomb', 'return', 'surface', 'serve', 'backdrop', 'most', 'major', 'action', 'season', 'leading', 'up', 'direct', 'confrontation', 'Buffy', 'final', 'episode.Perhaps', 'other', 'show', 'television', 'given', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'zingers', 'one-line', 'catch', 'phrases', 'digging', 'deeply', 'world', 'popular', 'culture', 'also', 'impressively', 'realistic', 'look', 'youth', 'issues', 'young', 'people', 'confront', 'normal', 'non-vampire', 'world', 'Buffy', 'about', 'much', 'more', 'slaying', 'vampires', 'vanquishing', 'demons', 'like', 'Buffy', 'Xander', 'Willow', 'particular', 'deal', 'problems', 'have', 'faced', 'type', 'evil', 'threats', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'only', 'Sunnydale', 'aspect', 'show', 'connects', 'many', 'fans']",N/A

The show isn't quite as camp as the movie, which truthfully is something of a relief; the movie just wouldn't fly now.The show itself, while having a little of the shakiness that any new series will have, is remarkably self-assured and inventive right off the bat.  The high-school metaphors are a little obvious at times, but it's usually funnier than your average sitcom.  That's part of the reason I broke my rule about buying season-sets; normally, I prefer to be able to buy just the episodes I want and not have a third of the season that I almost never watch.What's really surprising is, truthfully, how quickly the show improved in just twelve episodes.  You can see it in the technical details; compare the fights in the first disc to the fights in the third, the latter are much better choreographed.  Whedon managed to sketch in his characters, provide some great one-off episodes (&quot;Nightmares&quot; and &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot; are great examples), and also have an ongoing plot arc that he concludes in a quite satisfying and internally logical way.  It's a knack &quot;The X-Files&quot; used to have before Chris Carter got so self-indulgent (and, if the sixth season of Buffy is any indication, Whedon is beginning to go that route too.)This can be taken as either an introduction to the Buffy show (which is in regular reruns every night on FX, in addition to new episodes every Tuesday on UPN), or as its own self-contained little miniseries.

I mean, how interesting could a TV show based on vampires really be??During season 4 of Buffy, a friend made me watch the episode entitled 'Hush', and despite myself, I was quite impressed. I then started watching the Buffy reruns on cable. Though watching parts of seasons here and there gets very confusing when following storylines and character development. Then Buffy started to be released on DVD season by season. My chance to catch up with Buffy!!!!What initially struck me as I first starting watching season 1 on DVD was how 'raw' the shows were. Though raw in a good way. First seasons of TV shows usually have much lower budgets and hence the special effects and musical scoring aspects are usually more noticably lacking than later seasons. But this first 12 episode introduction to Buffy is something special. We see some wonderful storylines - not just about vampires, but stories involving demons, possessions and magic. The writers on Buffy truely are creative geniuses to come up with wonderful, interesting and believable storylines such as those in season 1 (well, believable in the Buffy sphere!)Whilst this show is about vampires, demons, and other paranormal phenomenon, these are really only metaphors used to illustrate the concepts of the turmoil of teenager years and developing into adulthood. If it were purely based around the paranormal, this show would have bombed, but thankfully the writers saw fit to address the themes that we all have faced (or will face) in life.The DVD itself is very nicely packaged. The quality of the picture itself is somewhat lacking sometimes  - though this is to be expected since season 1 was shot on 16mm film and there are alot of night shots on Buffy. However the quality is still improved to that of a normal TV reception.The extras include a Joss Whedon and David Boreanaz interview - whilst entertaining, it hardly gives away much information. A very clever music video for 'I Quit' is including also - great to see how music video footage and Buffy footage is combined to create a very entertaining video. The usual cast biographies, photo gallery and trailer are also on offer here, but the one extra that stands out is the audio commentaries on episodes 1 and 2. These were done by creator/writer/director/executive producer Joss Whedon who is not only entertaining to listen too, he also divulges alot of interesting information here. If you get this DVD pack, make sure you give these a listen....What could be better than having access to season 1 Buffy episodes at any time on DVD???  It may not be as polished as subsequent series, but the raw energy and the blood, sweat and tears of the cast and crew of what would go on to become a cultural phenomenon makes for highly entertaining and original television.",5,Virgin Buffy!,1042156800,"01 10, 2003",2003,3007,"['someone', 'had', 'said', 'couple', 'years', 'someone', 'who', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'horror/fantasy/sci-fi', 'fan', 'would', 'become', 'devout', 'fan', 'TV', 'series', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'would', 'have', 'laughed', 'face', 'mean', 'how', 'interesting', 'could', 'TV', 'show', 'based', 'vampires', 'really', 'be', 'season', '4', 'Buffy', 'friend', 'made', 'watch', 'episode', 'entitled', ""'Hush"", 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'then', 'started', 'watching', 'Buffy', 'reruns', 'cable', 'watching', 'parts', 'seasons', 'here', 'there', 'very', 'confusing', 'when', 'following', 'storylines', 'character', 'development', 'Then', 'Buffy', 'started', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'season', 'season', 'chance', 'catch', 'up', 'Buffy', 'What', 'initially', 'struck', 'first', 'starting', 'watching', 'season', '1', 'DVD', 'was', 'how', ""'raw"", 'shows', 'were', 'raw', 'good', 'way', 'First', 'seasons', 'TV', 'shows', 'usually', 'have', 'much', 'lower', 'budgets', 'hence', 'special', 'effects', 'musical', 'scoring', 'aspects', 'are', 'usually', 'more', 'noticably', 'lacking', 'later', 'seasons', 'first', '12', 'episode', 'introduction', 'Buffy', 'something', 'special', 'see', 'wonderful', 'storylines', 'not', 'just', 'vampires', 'stories', 'involving', 'demons', 'possessions', 'magic', 'writers', 'Buffy', 'truely', 'are', 'creative', 'geniuses', 'come', 'up', 'wonderful', 'interesting', 'believable', 'storylines', 'such', 'season', '1', 'well', 'believable', 'Buffy', 'sphere', 'show', 'vampires', 'demons', 'other', 'paranormal', 'phenomenon', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'metaphors', 'used', 'illustrate', 'concepts', 'turmoil', 'teenager', 'years', 'developing', 'adulthood', 'were', 'purely', 'based', 'paranormal', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'bombed', 'thankfully', 'writers', 'saw', 'fit', 'address', 'themes', 'have', 'faced', 'will', 'face', 'life.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'quality', 'picture', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'sometimes', 'be', 'expected', 'season', '1', 'was', 'shot', '16mm', 'film', 'are', 'alot', 'night', 'shots', 'Buffy', 'However', 'quality', 'still', 'improved', 'normal', 'TV', 'reception.The', 'extras', 'include', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'interview', 'whilst', 'entertaining', 'hardly', 'away', 'much', 'information', 'very', 'clever', 'music', 'video', 'Quit', 'including', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'how', 'music', 'video', 'footage', 'Buffy', 'footage', 'combined', 'create', 'very', 'entertaining', 'video', 'usual', 'cast', 'biographies', 'photo', 'gallery', 'trailer', 'are', 'also', 'offer', 'here', 'one', 'extra', 'out', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'episodes', '1', '2', 'were', 'done', 'creator/writer/director/executive', 'producer', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'entertaining', 'listen', 'too', 'also', 'alot', 'interesting', 'information', 'here', 'get', 'DVD', 'pack', 'make', 'sure', 'give', 'listen', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'having', 'access', 'season', '1', 'Buffy', 'episodes', 'time', 'DVD', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'polished', 'subsequent', 'series', 'raw', 'energy', 'blood', 'sweat', 'tears', 'cast', 'crew', 'what', 'would', 'go', 'become', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'original', 'television']",N/A

""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and the subsequent and equally entertaining spin-off ""Angel"" postulates a world that is pervaded by the supernatural.  Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an otherwise normal high school girl, is the current incarnation of the Slayer, a superpowerful force for good that always takes the form of a young woman.  Along with her friends Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Willow (Allyson Hannigan), her mentor Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), her mysterious boyfriend Angel (David Boreanaz), and the venomous Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), she struggles with the forces of darkness and adolescence in equal measure.No program has ever done a better job of mixing thrills, comedy and genuine drama.  I remove a star from the first season simply to give myself somewhere to go later, when Whedon had finished assembling a core of writers who thoroughly understood his concept, and the show reached its creative heights.  Standout episodes include ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" (the series premiere that introduces Buffy to her new school), ""Angel"" (which reveals a devastating secret about her mysterious paramour), ""Puppet Show"" (a hilarious and creepy episode about a living ventriloquist's dummy and some mysterious murders), and ""Prophecy Girl"" (the season finale that resolves the Master story arc)./",4,A Slayer is born,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,1471,"['creation', 'elaboration', 'Buffyverse', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'proved', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'auteurs', 'working', 'television', 'today', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'subsequent', 'equally', 'entertaining', 'spin-off', 'Angel', 'world', 'pervaded', 'supernatural', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'otherwise', 'normal', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'current', 'incarnation', 'Slayer', 'superpowerful', 'force', 'good', 'always', 'form', 'young', 'woman', 'friends', 'Xander', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'Willow', 'Allyson', 'Hannigan', 'mentor', 'Giles', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'mysterious', 'boyfriend', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'venomous', 'Cordelia', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'forces', 'darkness', 'adolescence', 'equal', 'measure.No', 'program', 'ever', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'mixing', 'thrills', 'comedy', 'genuine', 'drama', 'remove', 'star', 'first', 'season', 'simply', 'give', 'somewhere', 'go', 'later', 'when', 'Whedon', 'had', 'finished', 'assembling', 'core', 'writers', 'who', 'thoroughly', 'understood', 'concept', 'show', 'reached', 'creative', 'heights', 'Standout', 'include', 'Welcome', 'Hellmouth', 'series', 'premiere', 'Buffy', 'new', 'school', 'Angel', 'devastating', 'secret', 'mysterious', 'paramour', 'Puppet', 'Show', 'hilarious', 'creepy', 'episode', 'living', 'ventriloquist', 'dummy', 'mysterious', 'murders', 'Prophecy', 'Girl', 'season', 'finale', 'Master', 'story', 'arc', './']",N/A

I didn't think they could pull it off considering how buffy was a senior when she discovered her gift and started to slay the demons in the movie and killed a master at the school dance. In the show she comes in as a freshman who torched a gym already knowing that she was and in the craft of slaying already. but i guess they didn't want to necessarily tie it to the movie that way.I honestly thought I wouldn't like it. But as I watched I was drawn into it more and more. Couldn't wait to get home when Seven O'clock hit. No one was allowed to bother me when i was watchin ""my show"" and i hated watching tv. They ignored the typical stereotype of her being popular airhead and made her the outcast of which was cool.After season 5 though...her all of a sudden having a sister and then her dying at the end (a fittind end) and being resurected (not smart) I felt like they were trying to hard to keep the show going and they were running out of ideas. a lot of the episodes seemed..not fitting to the Show title because she fought less and less vampiresThe episode where she became a counceler at the  school had been and all the girls were goin crazy over the dude with spelled letter jacket was the dumbest episode i had seenTo top it off they got repetitive when she started fooling around with Spike that twisted love affair wit the 'Bad vamp turn good vamp in love and go back to bad vamp' had already been done with Angel and that was enough.

Mok,"[2, 2]","This boxed set and its follow-up (the six-disc Second Season set) are must-owns if you're even remotely interested in film or television.Buffy the Vampire Slayer simply has some of the best writing going.  Joss Whedon made a brilliant move by adapting the charming but forgettable 1992 feature into the television medium.  The longer character-development arcs and sense of intimacy in television are just perfect for fleshing out what at first may seem a whimsical idea, that of a high-school cheerleader who defies horror-movie convention and strikes back at the monsters and madmen.Within the first episode of the first season, the series finds its heart (along with your funny bone) and never loses it.  Of course, much credit has to be given to the stellar cast:  As Buffy, Sarah Michelle Gellar's is nothing short of a virtuoso performance, her facility with both drama and comedy lighting up every scene; Nicolas Brendon is delightful as charming loser Xander, often surprising you with moments of pathos underneath a clown veneer.  Alyson Hanigan (Willow)'s comic timing is razor-sharp, and Anthony Stewart Head deftly juggles stuck-up conservatism and a disarming sense of self-deprecating humour as Buffy's &quot;Watcher&quot; and guardian, Giles.  Even the small roles are highly memorable, my favourite being the engrossing role-switching dual performance of Robin Riker and Elizabeth Anne Allen in the episode &quot;Witch&quot;.The writing is some of the sharpest I've seen in TV, witty and authentic to its teenage characters, free of the I'm-too-hip attitude that so many teen movies are plagued by.  And Whedon had made sure that amidst all the monster slaying and wisecracks, emotional resonance is never sacrificed.  Each one of these characters is lovingly constructed, feeling like old friends after a while.The second season is where the series really soars into the stratosphere.  However, the first season contained in this boxed set is lighter in tone and therefore, arguably, more purely enjoyable.  A definite candidate for the top spot in my DVD collection.",5,Splendid.,1024704000,"06 22, 2002",2002,2084,"['boxed', 'set', 'follow-up', 'six-disc', 'Second', 'Season', 'set', 'are', 'must-owns', ""'re"", 'even', 'remotely', 'interested', 'film', 'television.Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'simply', 'best', 'writing', 'going', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'made', 'brilliant', 'move', 'adapting', 'charming', 'forgettable', '1992', 'feature', 'television', 'medium', 'longer', 'character-development', 'arcs', 'sense', 'intimacy', 'television', 'are', 'just', 'perfect', 'fleshing', 'out', 'what', 'first', 'may', 'seem', 'whimsical', 'idea', 'high-school', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'horror-movie', 'convention', 'strikes', 'back', 'monsters', 'madmen.Within', 'first', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'heart', 'funny', 'bone', 'never', 'course', 'much', 'credit', 'be', 'given', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Buffy', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'nothing', 'short', 'virtuoso', 'performance', 'facility', 'drama', 'comedy', 'lighting', 'up', 'scene', 'Nicolas', 'Brendon', 'delightful', 'charming', 'loser', 'Xander', 'often', 'surprising', 'moments', 'pathos', 'clown', 'veneer', 'Alyson', 'Hanigan', 'Willow', 'comic', 'timing', 'razor-sharp', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'deftly', 'stuck-up', 'conservatism', 'disarming', 'sense', 'self-deprecating', 'humour', 'Buffy', 'quot', 'Watcher', 'quot', 'guardian', 'Giles', 'Even', 'small', 'roles', 'are', 'highly', 'memorable', 'favourite', 'being', 'engrossing', 'role-switching', 'dual', 'performance', 'Robin', 'Riker', 'Elizabeth', 'Anne', 'Allen', 'episode', 'quot', 'Witch', 'quot', 'writing', 'sharpest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TV', 'witty', 'authentic', 'teenage', 'characters', 'free', ""I'm-too-hip"", 'attitude', 'so', 'many', 'teen', 'movies', 'are', 'plagued', 'Whedon', 'had', 'made', 'sure', 'monster', 'slaying', 'wisecracks', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'never', 'sacrificed', 'one', 'characters', 'lovingly', 'constructed', 'feeling', 'old', 'friends', 'while.The', 'second', 'season', 'where', 'series', 'really', 'stratosphere', 'However', 'first', 'season', 'contained', 'boxed', 'set', 'lighter', 'tone', 'therefore', 'arguably', 'more', 'purely', 'enjoyable', 'definite', 'candidate', 'top', 'spot', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

564019,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B00005221I,DonAthos,"[3, 3]","Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the greatest show in television history. Buffy's First Season will not prove this conclusively to you, but it is required viewing before you get to the episodes and seasons which *will*.You're probably saying to yourself ""Yeah--right. A show about vampires, called 'Buffy' for crissakes. I'm sure that'll be *really* great... if you're a twelve year old."" I mean, that's exactly what I said before I sat down to watch. But let me tell you that Buffy displays a level of intelligence and continuity that almost no other show does. The writing is in a league of its own, hitting home-runs in comedy, tragedy and suspense. The characters, despite their being fantastic (like witches and demons, etc.) are emotionally realistic and sympathetic. The acting is commendable. The direction, often top-notch. The special effects and scoring are somewhat weak in the first season, but they improve as the series progresses and eventually are quite compelling. And, above all, the storytelling is magnificent beyond compare. No other show can boast episodes like Becoming, The Body, Once More With Feeling, Who Are You, Innocent and Prophecy Girl, among others. No other show even attempts the daring of Buffy--the musical, the silence of Hush, the darkness of the sixth season or the zaniness of The Zeppo.It's hard to back up all of these claims in a short review like this--after all, the show runs seven seasons--and it's impossible to do without spoiling things that should be surprises. But let me tell you that Buffy manages to create loveable characters that will live well beyond the series, gut-wrenching moments that will  move cynics to tears, laugh-out-loud lines that your friends will quote without end, and moral dilemmas that will get you to think, and re-think, and argue and debate and discuss.In the end, you should go out of your way to watch this series. But don't rush because you have time; Buffy will be with us for a while. The quality of the series is such that it has already inspired spin-offs, novels, conventions and academic conferences(!).

564020,A2QOQKEG2VTX48,B00005221I,DONNA J. MILLER,"[3, 6]","Rarely do shows really have a great start in a mid season when replacing another show. &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; is one of those shows that replaced a show at mid season but caught on like it had been on all year. &quot;Buffy&quot; is not only a different and clever show, but it is great fun and very well done. In fact, I believe that &quot;Buffy&quot; is one of the best, if the not the best, television shows to ever air. It is just simply great with its great cast and crew, clever story, and a hip, fun style to it. &quot;Buffy&quot; is by far one of the greatest shows.First, &quot;Buffy&quot; has a great starting cast that has no big stars (at the time) but they would soon become the leading Hollywood Actors, Actresses, Writers, and Directors. Joss Wheadon deserves most credit for creating an edgy and daring show that was a spin off of a very unsuccessful movie. Wheadon wrote the movie, but it was clearly edited and the show is much better with a whole new crew of writers and directors. Replacing Kristi Swanson, who played Buffy Summers in the 1992 movie, is Sarah Michelle Gellar, who on the first episode beats out Swanson for the 'best Buffy' award. There is no other way to say this except that Gellar is simply perfect for the role. Her supporting cast include British actor Anthony Stewart Head as Giles, the Slayer's &quot;watcher&quot;. Head creates a more likable and believable Watcher than the film's Donald Sutherland. Also are Buffy's band of friends Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Xander (Nicholas Brendan) who are both geeks but turn out to be both interesting and fun to watch. They take their characters and make a complex world of demons and magics also have human like qualities. Charisma Carpenter replaces the attitude that Swanson's Buffy had in the movie. Carpenter plays a rich, snobbish girl named Cordelia who is like Buffy's human nemesis. David Boreanaz plays Angel, a tourtured vampire with a soul who also finds a romantic relationship with the slayer. This impossible love story is much more fascinating that the dull and stupid one between Swanson's Buffy and Luke Perry. The villains are also much better and much scarier, such as the main villain who is called The Master (Mark Metcalf) and his little group of meanies including the vampiress Darla (Julie Benz). Yes, it it for sure, the cast alone makes this series an instant hit.Second, even with a great cast, they need a good story to work with. &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; does of course have a main theme which includes The Master and Buffy's battle, but the true genius comes from the relationships played out by the characters. A tangled love story unfolds as the nerdy Willow is in love with her lifelong friend Xander, while Xander falls for new friend Buffy, even though Buffy is deeply in love with the tourtured vampire Angel. And a vampire in love with a slayer? That's just great writing. The monsters are also cool to look at, such as a giant preying mantis or even a demon trapped inside a robot body. The mythology is also created as the show goes on until there is a whole history dating back hundreds of years in the 'Buffy-universe'. More greatness of the show comes from the fact that it takes problems people deal with in everyday high school and turn those problems into monsters, such as the quiet girl who no one ever really sees turns invisible. Without a doubt, this is a great story.Finally, to truly connect to the audience of teenagers, the writers had to make the show a hip and fun show that wasn't all about horror and monsters, but also about what was the current craze or big thing. People can relate to the show, such as the fact that if someone writes 'Have a nice Summer' in your yearbook it's because they had nothing else to say. Buffy also had a mix of unique and catchy clothes. Whatever was in on Buffy, was in everywhere else. Buffy had about as much influence on pop culture as any other show did, including &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;. &quot;Buffy&quot; was a great show that could have everything in it.In conclusion, &quot;Buffy&quot; is a show that can't get much better. Yes, at times its corny, but isn't it suppose to be? The show is funny at the right times, scary at the right times, and heartbreaking at the same times. This is one of the greatest seasons of the show, and with the spectacular second season following up close, its even better!

564022,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B00005221I,Duane Thomas,"[5, 5]","Buffy the Vampire Slayer the TV series began as a mid-season replacement (there are only 12 episodes in the first season) which means you're fighting for your life right off the bat. Since the creative team, primarily Joss Whedon, had to hit the ground running, for episode ideas they ruthlessly plundered every pre-existing horror concept they could lay hands on. In this first season, the episodes are much more stand alone, monster-of-the-week fests than the complex, long-term story arcs that would characterize later seasons. You either rise to such a challenge or you falter. Whedon & Co. went the former route, and in doing so, the frantic efforts of everyone involved lend this season a manic inventiveness, mixed with a certain schlockiness, that's immensely appealing.In Season One, everyone involved with the project was willing to exploit any advantage they had to ensure the series survived. This included dressing Sarah Michelle Gellar in every lowcut, tight outfit complete with push-up bra they could find (which led Gellar to joke in an interview they were trying to morph her into Pamela Sue Anderson). Even Willow, who in later episodes would be presented as kind of dowdy until she blossomed into beauty years later, wears quite a bit of makeup in the pilot. Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia of course always looked phenomenal. And if having three great looking girls in the pilot episode was what it took to draw in male viewers, the Buffy crew was okay with that.Episode One of Buffy the Vampire Slayer could be used as a textbook example of how to do a television pilot. Within minutes, without feeling forced or artificial, all the main characters are introduced, their personalities and the dynamics of the relationships that will carry them for years to come firmly established. Buffy Summers is an intelligent smartass desperate to leave behind her life as the ""Chosen One"". Alexander ""Xander"" Harris has the self-image of a geek (in many ways he IS a geek) but underneath that beats the heart of a noble knight and an utter willingness to be completely devoted to Buffy. Willow Rosenberg is a computer whiz with a sweet disposition, repressed sexuality, and an IQ that looks like a zip code. Joyce Summers is a stressed-out, hard working divorced mom who truly loves her daughter but only knows how to show it by being overbearing and critical to the point of cruelty. Angel is a brooding, mysterious, angst-ridden hunk with a dark past and immense - and reciprocated - attraction toward Buffy. Rupert Giles, the school librarian and Buffy's Watcher, is a veddy proper Englishman, a softspoken but demanding mentor, and supplies the father figure that Buffy, the product of a broken home, so desperately needs. Ultra-popular, ultra-beautiful, ultra-self-centered Cordelia Chase is the girl every guy wanted, and every girl hated, in high school. She serves the important function of being the one person in the entire show so insensitive, so blunt, she'll simply tell the truth as she sees it (which is spot-on an amazing amount of the time) no matter how unpleasant that truth may be. After Charisma departed Buffy for Angel, that function was served by the character of Anya, less successfully in my opinion. Anya's lack of tact was due to inexperience and ignorance of human social rules. Cordelia Chase by contrast knew she was being rude. She just didn't care. Thus her character had more edge.There's been much written about how BtVS takes real human problems, expanding them through the device of the supernatural without ever losing the core emotional truth that people, especially adolescents, recognize and respond to. Thus in Season One we have a story about Xander being stalked by a praying mantis woman intent on mating with then dismembering him - but it's really a story about the terror of losing your virginity. We have a story about a pyromaniac witch killing cheerleaders - but it's really a story about parents trying to push their children to be just like them. We have a werewolf story (actually in this case werehyenas) - but it's really about being victimized by school bullies and finding the courage to fight back. We have a demon luring kids to their deaths Internet stalker-style - but it's really a story about wanting love so much you look for it in the wrong places. And so on.To start with, Buffy the Vampire Slayer had a small (but fiercely loyal) band of viewers. I was one of them. These episodes will show you why we knew, from the very beginning, something great was in the process of happening - something that with Season Two would become a cultural phenomenon.",5,"""We saved the world.

I hadn't seen the whole first season before, I'd seen bits and pieces but I wanted to see it in order with no commercials.  This release fulfills my wish, the extras are pretty timid, but most TV season DVDs are this way.  I like the commentaries though, humorous as well as giving me those tidbits I crave.

I guess, my favorite episodes are &quot;Out of Sight, Out of Mind&quot;, and &quot;Witch.&quot;  Prophecy Girl is pretty good also.

Bieber,"[0, 0]","Practically every series starts out awkward as writers and actors get their bearings and this show is no exception.Sadly, this shows never gets off the ground.  We kept hoping, but every season was as dumb as the one before it.  We noticed, as well, that the only characters who grew had left this two dimensional show and moved to Angel.  Cordelia,  Wesley, and Spike were flat and forced until they moved to Angel and got rounded out, becoming more complex and real.  Since the actors obviously have potential, it must be the writing and directing that is so pathetic in this show.At one point, Xander disapproves of Willow's addiction to witchcraft and her intent to use for revenge, by saying that part of life is to accept that the universe doesn't always function according to your perceived needs and that he thought it a bad idea to reach to forces that don't intend to do us any good to get what the universe thinks you shouldn't have.  One truly profound comment in a sea of juvenile flatness.  I wish the show and our culture made more of that.  Forget magic, when we reach for anger, for example, to give us power, we are all doing what Willow did, reaching for a destructive force to get our way and finding that, just like magic took over and nearly consumed Willow, anger or selfishness, or anything destructive, in the end, is not ruled by us, but takes over and leads those who use it to their own eventual ruin.  Sometimes it is just better to accept a loss or an insult, rather than becoming enslaved to a destructive force.In sum, there was potential in this show, but it never got fulfilled.",3,Show with wasted potential,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,1612,"['Practically', 'series', 'out', 'awkward', 'writers', 'actors', 'get', 'bearings', 'show', 'exception.Sadly', 'never', 'ground', 'kept', 'hoping', 'season', 'was', 'as', 'dumb', 'one', 'noticed', 'well', 'only', 'characters', 'who', 'grew', 'had', 'left', 'two', 'dimensional', 'show', 'moved', 'Angel', 'Cordelia', 'Wesley', 'Spike', 'were', 'flat', 'forced', 'moved', 'Angel', 'got', 'rounded', 'out', 'becoming', 'more', 'complex', 'real', 'actors', 'obviously', 'have', 'potential', 'must', 'be', 'writing', 'directing', 'so', 'pathetic', 'show.At', 'one', 'point', 'Xander', 'Willow', 'addiction', 'witchcraft', 'intent', 'use', 'revenge', 'saying', 'part', 'life', 'accept', 'universe', ""n't"", 'always', 'function', 'according', 'perceived', 'needs', 'thought', 'bad', 'idea', 'reach', 'forces', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'do', 'good', 'get', 'what', 'universe', 'thinks', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'One', 'truly', 'profound', 'comment', 'sea', 'juvenile', 'flatness', 'wish', 'show', 'culture', 'made', 'more', 'Forget', 'magic', 'when', 'reach', 'anger', 'example', 'give', 'power', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'Willow', 'did', 'reaching', 'destructive', 'force', 'get', 'way', 'finding', 'just', 'magic', 'took', 'over', 'nearly', 'consumed', 'Willow', 'anger', 'selfishness', 'anything', 'destructive', 'end', 'not', 'ruled', 'leads', 'who', 'use', 'own', 'eventual', 'ruin', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'better', 'accept', 'loss', 'insult', 'rather', 'becoming', 'enslaved', 'destructive', 'force.In', 'sum', 'was', 'potential', 'show', 'never', 'got', 'fulfilled']",N/A

564032,A1OZFMJ2AD2R41,B00005221I,Furiae,"[0, 0]","I was hesitant in buying the first season.  Most times, the first season of a show makes you wince and cringe when you re-watch them.  Shows usually take a season or two to come into their own.  There's usually a lot of hit-and-miss that goes on in first seasons of TV shows.  It had been a while since I had seen the first season of Buffy, so my fear was that I'd waste money watching a season I'd rather forget.  Not so!In fact, I was surprised at how flawless the first season was delivered!  This intial season definitely stands on its own.  The quality of everything from acting to presentation never comes across as a fumbled attempt to make a series.  The writing is strong as ever, the jokes are funny, the actors are spot on, and the presentation and dress are hip, even now, years later.The story, as all Buffy fans know, starts here with Buffy coming to Sunnydale, California to begin a new life with her mother.  Little known to her is that Sunnydale is actually ""the hellmouth.""  She's going to have her work cut out for her, but with the help of new friends, Willow and Xander, and her watcher (supervisor, guide, and trainer) Rupert Giles, she starts letting the demonic Sunnydale residents know that the slayer's in town, and she's making it her own.I was actually talking about Buffy the other day with my husband.  He didn't pay much heed to Buffy before we bought this DVD set, but he couldn't get enough of Buffy after the first episode!  Now, he watches the latest season with me every week.  We spoke about how Buffy the Vampire Slayer holds the very rare distinction of being the only series we've seen that had a strong start to begin with.  Regardless of being new to TV, this first season didn't skip a beat.  It was as if the writers, producers, and actors had been doing Buffy for years and years before.  What a way to start off the show!I think that this season, now looking in retrospect, is truly my favorite.  The entire season was strong, and there's really a beautiful nostalgia to it.  It's the most innocent of all the seasons, and Buffy's troubles were simple.  The drama with Faith, Angel, Spike, and Dawn didn't begin yet.  The biggest evil in Buffy's life at this point is high school, and there's something really enjoyable in that simplicity.Simply put, I can't believe I had actually waited the amount of time I did to buy this set.  I bought it two months after it was released, but I'm glad I did.  I've since then bought seasons two and three, and they are the perfect solution to a rainy day.",5,wonderful walk down memory lane!,1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,2540,"['was', 'hesitant', 'buying', 'first', 'season', 'Most', 'times', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'wince', 'cringe', 'when', 're-watch', 'usually', 'take', 'season', 'two', 'come', 'own', 'usually', 'lot', 'hit-and-miss', 'first', 'seasons', 'TV', 'shows', 'had', 'been', 'while', 'had', 'seen', 'first', 'season', 'Buffy', 'fear', 'was', ""'d"", 'waste', 'money', 'watching', 'season', ""'d"", 'rather', 'forget', 'Not', 'so', 'fact', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'flawless', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'delivered', 'intial', 'season', 'definitely', 'own', 'quality', 'everything', 'acting', 'presentation', 'never', 'across', 'fumbled', 'attempt', 'make', 'series', 'writing', 'strong', 'ever', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'actors', 'are', 'spot', 'presentation', 'dress', 'are', 'hip', 'even', 'now', 'years', 'later.The', 'story', 'Buffy', 'fans', 'know', 'here', 'Buffy', 'coming', 'Sunnydale', 'California', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'mother', 'Little', 'known', 'Sunnydale', 'actually', 'hellmouth', 'going', 'have', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'help', 'new', 'friends', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'watcher', 'supervisor', 'guide', 'trainer', 'Rupert', 'Giles', 'letting', 'demonic', 'Sunnydale', 'residents', 'know', 'slayer', 'town', 'making', 'own.I', 'was', 'actually', 'talking', 'Buffy', 'other', 'day', 'husband', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'heed', 'Buffy', 'bought', 'DVD', 'set', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Buffy', 'first', 'episode', 'Now', 'latest', 'season', 'week', 'spoke', 'how', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'very', 'rare', 'distinction', 'being', 'only', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'had', 'strong', 'start', 'begin', 'Regardless', 'being', 'new', 'TV', 'first', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'skip', 'beat', 'was', 'writers', 'producers', 'actors', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'Buffy', 'years', 'years', 'before', 'What', 'way', 'start', 'off', 'show', 'think', 'season', 'now', 'looking', 'retrospect', 'truly', 'favorite', 'entire', 'season', 'was', 'strong', 'really', 'beautiful', 'nostalgia', 'most', 'innocent', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'troubles', 'were', 'simple', 'drama', 'Faith', 'Angel', 'Spike', 'Dawn', 'did', ""n't"", 'begin', 'yet', 'biggest', 'evil', 'Buffy', 'life', 'point', 'high', 'school', 'something', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'simplicity.Simply', 'put', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'had', 'actually', 'waited', 'amount', 'time', 'did', 'buy', 'set', 'bought', 'two', 'months', 'was', 'released', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""'ve"", 'then', 'bought', 'seasons', 'two', 'three', 'are', 'perfect', 'solution', 'rainy', 'day']",N/A

Creator Joss Whedon does the commentary on the first couple of the episodes and sheds some interesting info on some of the thinking behind the scenes.

564037,A1L3E4ZLRNKFNP,B00005221I,Gary,"[0, 0]","Since it's debut six seasons ago, Buffy the Vampire Slayer has been one of the most original and inventive shows on television.  Many critics believe that Buffy is one of the best shows currently airing, if not THE best.  The show cleverly uses the supernatural and dark forces as metaphors for everyday teen struggles, and the process of growing up into adulthood.  The Complete first season on DVD is the best way to start from the beginning to see how your favorite characters have grown over the years, if you haven't done so already.FOX has been releasing the Buffy series on DVD for the past several years over in the UK, while the US fans had to wait impatiently for their chance to own them. And now, Fox has finally released season one here in the US while the show has just ended its sixth season on UPN.  For all Buffy fans, this is the best way to own your favorite show.  Not only do you get extra material, DVD provides crystal clear digital picture, and whopping audio.For those of you who aren't familiar with this series, this is the perfect chance for you to start.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer was picked up as a midseason replacement on The WB in 1996, therefore, the first season was only composed of 12 episodes, where the seasons following each contained 22.  The characters are unique and funny, and brilliantly acted.  Buffy Summers played by Sarah Michelle Gellar (""Scooby Doo"", ""Cruel Intentions""), is the chosen one.  She must protect and defend the world against evil demons and vampires, and at the same time, she must balance that with her personal life.  Willow Rosenberg is the quirky computer nerd played by Alyson Hannigan (the ""American Pie"" series), who quickly becomes one of Buffy's best friends in the first episode.  Xander Hariss, who has known Willow for years, is played by Nicholas Brendon.  Cordelia Chase is the stereotypical popular girl that every school has.  She portrays herself as someone who is higher and above everyone else, but towards the end of the season, it also becomes clear that she also has problems and that her life isn't perfect.  Giles, played by Anthony Stewart Head,  is Buffy's watcher and must guide her throughout her challenges.  He quickly becomes a father figure to her.  And lastly, the mysterious, intriguing man known as Angel is played by David Boreanaz.  In the beginning of the season, he seems to be a goodguy, but in the episode entitled 'Angel', Buffy finds out that he's actually a vampire, but seemingly a 'good' vampire.  It is not until the next season until we learn Angel's complete past.  Buffy and Angel somewhat seem to have a 'thing' for each other, even though they both know that it can never be.  The show also contains some of the most wittiest dialogue seen on television.This show has something for everyone's tastes.  One of the most unique things about this series is that everyone has a character or two on the show that they can personally relate too.  This DVD collection is one of the best.  The collection is lacking much extra material, but to have the series first sesaon on DVD is enough alone.  Any true Buffy fan needs to own this.

A show led by an annoying soap opera diva ""star"" who is not half as talented as she believes herself to be; a show full of negative energy, bad influences, plot holes larger than evertyhting you've ever imagined (for instance, once Buffy used a ROCKET LAUNCHER INSIDE A MALL - and this was not even big news!!), a perfectly normal, young and brilliant character (Willow), who the writers turned GAY for the sake of nothing! (nothing against gays, it was simply not necessary). And the reason she became gay is because she lost the love of a guy who could not even bother to speak! (the werewolf Seth Green).But the plot holes are the real annoying thing. Suspension of desbelief won't make you forget them, because they are the essence of the show itself! It seem Joss Whedon made fun of all of the fans since the beginning. How, I repeat, HOW could Sunnydale High reamins open with people being killed by THE DOZENS inside it? There was no amount of police or Mayor's influence that could keep this secret. From teachers, to students, to coaches, to cleaning guys, a LOT of people died inside that school, all of them in a very violent mammer (in one episode, a guy kills his school budy because he's under influence of a demon who is inside the Internet... and he does it in a way to look like suicide - evil, evil, evil...) And, come next day, no one cares about nothing. Parents don't argue the authorities about what's happening (in ""GO FISH"", four students become monstruous fihes and disappears forever, wehen they go happily swimming into the ocean - what happened to their partens, their loved ones, the ones who cared about them?!!)Also we have a guy called Xander capable of leaving his future wife at the altar, only beacue he has ""doubts"". We also have sadistic writers who are capable of making the aforementioned main character (Xander) loses one eye for the sake of absolutely nothing at the final season.We have Cordelia Chase, who, even after being saved dozens of times by the heroe of the show, still treats her with contempt, as if she was a freak. By the way, look how Buffy dresses in high school.

564041,A3BMZYA7CT2E74,B00005221I,G. Garner,"[7, 8]","There seems to be a lot of debate as to which season of Buffy is the best. But there's no question, for me,  that the first season is the most underrated. Maybe it's because of its shorter length(about half the typical length for a Buffy season) or because it aired while the show was still under the radar for most people. Either way, it's usually mentioned as more or less of an afterthought. This is unfortunate, and absurd.It's a great season, even by Buffy standards(which are the highest ever set for a tv show.) True, it's shorter than the others. And there are a couple of character moves that don't ring true(Giles and Angel both seem poorly developed in the pilot, compared to what they were to become even within the next few episodes).But Season One is absolutely brimming with the qualities that made Buffy such a phenomenal series. It had the brilliant writing and dialogue to which fans have become so accustomed. Viewers are also treated to the greatest ensemble in the history of television-there is not a weak link in the cast. In addition, the quality of the specific episodes is vastly underrated. For example, out of a seven year span, it would be difficult for me to select any one hour episode that I would put ahead of 'Angel' or 'Prophecy Girl'. (and only a couple-'Passion' and 'The Gift'-that I'd even place in the same league.So many of the show's finest moments are showcased in its inaugural year. For example, in 'Puppet Show', when we see Giles being compelled to judge the school talent competition, and the priceless look of suppressed agony on his usually stoic face. Or in 'Out of Mind, Out of Sight', when Cordelia, fearing for her life, comes to the Scoobies to beg for help( I know we've never been close, what with you being so weird and all......'). Even with her life on the line, Cordelia still can't help being........Cordelia. Or, on a more chilling note, the moment in 'Angel' when he recounts, with such casual pragmatism, killing his family, their friends, their friends' children...........In 'Nightmares', the look on Buffy's face when her father reveals that her parents' divorce was, as she had feared, her fault.The mournful sounds,coming from somewhere in the ceiling, of someone playing a flute, cascading through the empty corridors of the school, in'Out of Mind, Out of Sight'.Or in 'Prophecy Girl', the stricken look on Willow's face as she stares, aghast, into that bloody tv screen. So many unforgettable moments............I love the supporting players. But this show is not called 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' for nothing. None of this would be the same without Sarah Michelle Gellar. I have never seen a young actress dominate the screen like she did. First, the obvious-she was just SO BEAUTIFUL. From the standpoint of simple physical appeal and charisma, I thought that year one was her best by far. (Sue me-I like curves). But it went so far beyond that. There was a natural charm about her, something so basic and unaffected. The sort of charm that you find in girls who have an innate confidence, but without being overly conceited.If you want a perfect illustration, watch 'Welcome to the Hellmouth,' when she runs into Giles at(of all places) the Bronze, and listen to the conversation that ensues. (Partying with the students? Isn't that kind of skanky?) When Giles asks if an outfit is dated, her response-'it's carbon dated.'In so many ways, she's such a typical late twentieth-century American girl. But, once you've seen her in 'Prophecy Girl,' the first season's finale, you can never again envision anyone else in this role.In 'Prophecy Girl,' Buffy learns that an ancient prophecy guarantees her death in an upcoming battle. The look of terror, of grief, on her face, was so real, and so powerful. She flings down her cross, and, for all purposes, quits on the spot. But, upon reflection, she returns. This is her most iconic moment. Clad in a stunning prom dress, with a leather jacket on top, and armed with her crossbow.........What can you say? This is just the coolest girl of all time.If you've read this far, it will be apparent that I am an ardent fan of the show. I loved it from the start. It has power and depth, but also an undeniable warmth and charm, that are all its own. The initial season is unique in a couple of ways. It is the only year of Buffy that can stand alone-it has a self-contained feel to it. It is also distinctive in that several of the shows border on traditional mysteries, which was a trend which gradually declined over the years.Perhaps most rare of all, it is 'smart people friendly.' It has two major characters-Willow and Giles-who like BOOKS. They feel right at home in the LIBRARY. In the Buffyverse, these things are not relics-they are essential facets of life. I don't know if I've ever seen a show where thoughtful, cerebral people could find such a warm,welcoming environment.If you are new to the series, I'll close by saying this.....Buffy is not for everybody. But those of us who love it, tend to regard it as far more than a television show. I actually envy people who are just coming to it, who get to experience all of this for the first time. I promise you, there is nothing else like it.",5,5 Stars Have Never Seemed More Inadequate,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,5220,"['be', 'lot', 'debate', 'season', 'Buffy', 'best', 'question', 'first',

Buffy had just mistaken Cordelia for a vampire (who could really blame her for that mistake?) and thrown her up against a wall at The Bronze.  Cordelia exclaims, ""What is your childhood trauma?!""  EVERY other show ever made in the history of tv would have had that line written to be the standard, boring ""What is your problem?""  That's when I knew this show was different, special, better than anything that had come before - and I never missed a single episode from that point through episode 144, the series finale.  And I was never disappointed.  From the very beginning, BtVS turned horror, comedy, and drama conventions on their heads and never looked back.  This first season wasn't as polished or perfected as succeeding seasons of the show, but it was still groundbreaking television.  In fact, while the stories in it were less polished, season one may actually be the most important season of the series.

564046,A28ILXH590CMRJ,B00005221I,Hazen B Markoe,"[4, 5]","On March 3rd, 1997, the WB network introduced a series that today still defines quality TV. Its mix of comedy, action and drama have rarely been matched, even today.  Now, finally, after years of waiting, American audiences can collect the stellar series, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, from the very beginning.  This show chronicles the adventures of young Buffy Summers, a high school student who is revealed as the Chosen One destined to fight the demons and vampires that plague the world. Since this was a mid-season replacement, there were only 12 episodes in this 1st season.  As always, Sarah Michelle Geller is at the top of her game in the title role, while Anthony Stewart Head is full of wry humor as Rupert Giles, her Watcher.The episodes, despite being filmed in 16mm, are sharp in both visual and sound quality.  However, the special features are a little lacking.  There's an insighful and amusing commentary by show creator, Joss Whedon, which covers the 2 part pilot for the show.  However, the Whedon interview sections only covers only half of the episodes, being a hold-over from the old 3-pack VHS set.  Also, the interview with David Boreanez (Angel) doesn't offer anything new.  Some outtakes and making of featurettes would've been nice.  Hopefully, future season sets will correct this flaw.However, the thing is the show and these episodes are classic and fun.

Dumdei,"[3, 3]","I have been a big fan of this series since I first saw it in reruns the summer after first season, so of course I was super-excited about Season One finally being released on DVD here in the US.But the DVD just doesn't live up to what I expected. The menus on the DVDs are not the most user-friendly (all you get are episode titles for that disc; you have to go into an episode to access any special features on that disc). And speaking of special features, I wanted more. I am a big fan of Joss Whedon in particular, and having his commentary on ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"" was wonderfully illuminating, but I still felt like there should have been more behind-the-scenes stuff. The commentary felt rushed and really should have been included on a few more episodes (I'm thinking ""Prophecy Girl"" would have been a great episode to for more of his inside scoop.) Those extra interviews on ""Witch"", ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date"", ""Angel"", and ""The Puppet Show"" were nice, but they were on the season one VHS pack that has been out for so long now. How many shows have writing as clever and as interesting as Buffy does? I really wanted to hear more from the people who are behind that.That's not to say that I didn't like the DVD. Four stars is still a pretty good rating. The show itself is still fantastic (and only gets better as the seasons progress).

564049,A3IVIS1OPYUU0X,B00005221I,Henry Perkins,"[1, 1]","""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is a TV series take on the 1992 movie that Joss Whedon wrote.  Whedon didn't direct the movie, though, and he thought he could better communicate his ideas if he had control of a new ""Buffy"" show.  (The movie's director, Fran Rubel Kuzui, is one of the executive producers on the TV show.)  This first season was a late-winter entry in the new WB network's first (1996-1997) year in business, and contains only 12 episodes.In the TV series Buffy is newly transplanted to fictitious Sunnydale, California, after having burned down the gymnasium (while fighting vampires, of course) in her old L.A. high school at the end of the movie.  Kristy Swanson, who played Buffy in the movie, is replaced by Sarah Michelle Gellar, already a TV veteran when she started the show at age 20 playing the 16-year-old sophomore.  No other characters from the movie appear in the TV series.  With a different location and characters Joss Whedon had a great deal of freedom to expand his vision, which started with the simple idea of a small, blonde teenage girl walking alone down a sinister dark alley -- until she's attacked by a monster.  This horror cliche becomes interesting when it turns out that the attacking vampire has met his doom because the blonde girl is The Slayer, the one girl in all the world chosen to stand against the vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness.Much more information about the ""Buffy"" universe (or ""Buffyverse"") is available elsewhere, so I won't go into great detail here.  There are some significant differences between the movie and TV series visions of the vampires and demons existing on the periphery of our normal world.  In particular the TV series has slain vampires turning to dust, which helps maintain their status as fantasies to the uninformed majority of the human population.  And the TV series has Buffy amassing a close circle of high school friends who are privy to her secret, whereas the movie had a popular girl becoming alienated from her friends as a result of being Chosen.  The TV show has ample opportunity to demonstrate the everyday horrors of being in high school in addition to Sunnydale's supernatural terrors; the movie was a comic horror tale that didn't succeed as well in its message despite having a much higher budget.As a mid-season replacement show on a new TV network, the budget for ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was low by U.S. standards.  This first (short) season is distinguished by often-inadequate lighting, a theme song that was re-recorded in a later (4th?) season for better quality, and limited sets and special effects.  Yet it became a hit because of the writing and acting, featuring an innovative take on teenage creative speech which became known as ""Buffyspeak"".  Acknowledging the flaws, I still recommend this first season highly.Each show in Season 1 of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is almost exactly 45 minutes.  Later seasons bring this average down; with more allowance for commercials and promotional spots the time for actual program content in the hour show drops to about 42 minutes by the middle of the 7-year run.  So there's more entertainment content possible in the first 2 seasons' episodes than in later years.The DVD transfer of Season 1 is disappointing.  Each show appears pretty much as it was originally broadcast.  No apparent attempt was made to adjust for poor lighting or sound.  There are chapter stops, but many of them are misplaced -- some by up to a minute.  For instance, it's necessary to use the DVD fast forward or reverse to skip through the opening credits at the end of chapter 1 of each episode because the chapter 2 stops aren't placed properly.  In the DVD transfers of Seasons 3-4 the chapter stops are done correctly and the opening credits end just as chapter 2 begins.The supplementary material is interesting for behind-the-scenes production information.  Writers and directors are the talents for the audio commentary tracks.  You have to wait until Season 4 to get any insights from a cast member.  I wouldn't rate the supplementary material as a compelling reason to buy any of the ""Buffy"" or ""Angel"" DVD sets as of mid-2003; you'll buy Season 1 and the later DVD collections because you'll want to revisit the Buffyverse, just as I do.Summary: a 5-star show for its innovative ideas, writing, acting, and direction.  4 stars for the production values, with limited budget resulting in occasional sub-par lighting and sound.  Only 3 stars for the Season 1 DVD transfer.  Total score: 4 stars for this DVD collection.",4,Excellent show; merely adequate DVD transfer,1058572800,"07 19, 2003",2003,4569,"['Vampire', 'Slayer', 'TV', 'series', 'take', '1992', 'movie', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'wrote', 'Whedon', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'movie', 'though', 'thought', 'could', 'better', 'communicate', 'ideas', 'had', 'control', 'new', 'Buffy', 'show', 'movie', 'director', 'Fran', 'Rubel', 'Kuzui', 'one', 'executive', 'producers', 'TV', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'late-winter', 'entry', 'new', 'WB', 'network', 'first', '1996-1997', 'year', 'business', 'only', '12', 'episodes.In', 'TV', 'series', 'Buffy', 'newly', 'transplanted', 'fictitious', 'Sunnydale', 'California', 'having', 'burned', 'down', 'gymnasium', 'fighting', 'vampires', 'course', 'old', 'L.A.', 'high', 'school', 'end', 'movie', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'who', 'played', 'Buffy', 'movie', 'replaced', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'already', 'TV', 'veteran', 'when', 'started', 'show', 'age', '20', 'playing', '16-year-old', 'sophomore', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', 'appear', 'TV', 'series', 'different', 'location', 'characters', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'freedom', 'expand', 'vision', 'started', 'simple', 'idea', 'small', 'blonde', 'teenage', 'girl', 'walking', 'alone', 'down', 'sinister', 'dark', 'alley', 'attacked', 'monster', 'horror', 'cliche', 'interesting', 'when', 'out', 'attacking', 'vampire', 'met', 'doom', 'blonde', 'girl', 'Slayer', 'one', 'girl', 'world', 'chosen', 'stand', 'vampires', 'demons', 'other', 'forces', 'darkness.Much', 'more', 'information', 'Buffy', 'universe', 'Buffyverse', 'available', 'elsewhere', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'here', 'are', 'significant', 'differences', 'movie', 'TV', 'series', 'visions', 'vampires', 'demons', 'existing', 'periphery', 'normal', 'world', 'particular', 'TV', 'series', 'slain', 'vampires', 'turning', 'dust', 'maintain', 'status', 'fantasies', 'uninformed', 'majority', 'human', 'population', 'TV', 'series', 'Buffy', 'amassing', 'close', 'circle', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'privy', 'secret', 'movie', 'had', 'popular', 'girl', 'becoming', 'alienated', 'friends', 'result', 'being', 'Chosen', 'TV', 'show', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'demonstrate', 'everyday', 'horrors', 'being', 'high', 'school', 'addition', 'Sunnydale', 'supernatural', 'terrors', 'movie', 'was', 'comic', 'horror', 'tale', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'as', 'well', 'message', 'having', 'much', 'higher', 'budget.As', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'show', 'new', 'TV', 'network', 'budget', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'was', 'low', 'U.S.', 'standards', 'first', 'short', 'season', 'distinguished', 'often-inadequate', 'lighting', 'theme', 'song', 'was', 're-recorded', 'later', '4th', 'season', 'better', 'quality', 'limited', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'became', 'hit', 'writing', 'acting', 'featuring', 'innovative', 'take', 'teenage', 'creative', 'speech', 'became', 'known', 'Buffyspeak', 'Acknowledging', 'flaws', 'still', 'recommend', 'first', 'season', 'highly.Each', 'show', 'Season', '1', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'almost', 'exactly', '45', 'minutes', 'Later', 'seasons', 'bring', 'average', 'down', 'more', 'allowance', 'commercials', 'promotional', 'spots', 'time', 'actual', 'program', 'content', 'hour', 'show', '42', 'minutes', 'middle', '7-year', 'run', 'more', 'entertainment', 'content', 'possible', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'later', 'years.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'Season', '1', 'disappointing', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'apparent', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'adjust', 'poor', 'lighting', 'sound', 'are', 'chapter', 'stops', 'many', 'are', 'misplaced', 'minute', 'instance', 'necessary', 'use', 'DVD', 'fast', 'forward', 'reverse', 'skip', 'opening', 'credits', 'end', 'chapter', '1', 'episode', 'chapter', '2', 'stops', 'are', ""n't"", 'placed', 'properly', 'DVD', 'transfers', 'Seasons', '3-4', 'chapter', 'stops', 'are', 'done', 'correctly', 'opening', 'credits', 'end', 'just', 'chapter', '2', 'begins.The', 'supplementary', 'material', 'interesting', 'behind-the-scenes', 'production', 'information', 'Writers', 'directors', 'are', 'talents', 'audio', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'have', 'wait', 'Season', '4', 'get', 'insights', 'cast', 'member', 'would', ""n't"", 'rate', 'supplementary', 'material', 'compelling', 'reason', 'buy', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'DVD', 'mid-2003', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'Season', '1', 'later', 'DVD', 'collections', ""'ll"", 'want', 'revisit', 'Buffyverse', 'just', 'do.Summary', '5-star', 'show', 'innovative', 'ideas', 'writing', 'acting', 'direction', '4', 'stars', 'production', 'values', 'limited', 'budget', 'resulting', 'occasional', 'sub-par', 'lighting', 'sound', 'Only', '3', 'stars', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'Total', 'score', '4', 'stars', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A
564050,A33L3J8HZV8IEW,B00005221I,Holden Punk,"[2, 7]","Buffy season one was good for several reasons and bad for several.On the upside we meet some good characters.Angel the vampire with a soul, a tormented character in early development. Somewhat bouncier then the depressing guy in his own spinoff.Then we have Xander, the witty sarcastic goof with the hots for Buffy.Has some awesome lines and stays clear of the shows annoying catch phrase dialogue.Finally the new revamped (pun intended) Buffy. Sarah M Gellar is hot, but with an integrity which is rare in such a tacky role.She credits the series.Another plus to the show is the fact that unlike future series it is self contained, no cliffhangers at the end to make you need the next season to follow a plot line.The &quot;Freak of the week&quot; format used in this show (and Smallville)gives a reason for the supernatural being centralised around the shows base town &quot;SunnyDale&quot;.The town possesses a &quot;Hellmouth&quot;, Gate of hell and so is a magnet for monsters.The ongoing plot with evil nemesis &quot;The Master&quot; is weak and made worse by the poor casting of villain. You can't have a bad guy who can't hurt you and thats what we have here.The show does have other weak characters such as Willow. Maybe if she were a lesbian witch (as she later becomes) the show would have given her more screen time. I would have.All in all worth adding to your collection if you enjoy this sort of thing.As a fan of the program Angel, my recomendation is to view the first 3 seasons of Buffy as they lead to the next show.After season 3 the show decends into the metaphorical Hellmouth and becomes what I as a fan of the sci/horror genre call a &quot;Supernatural Soap Opera&quot;.If you enjoy this I would recommend Kolchak: The Night Stalker.",3,Freak of The Week Series,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,1757,"['Buffy', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'good', 'several', 'reasons', 'bad', 'several.On', 'upside', 'meet', 'good', 'characters.Angel', 'vampire', 'soul', 'tormented', 'character', 'early', 'development', 'Somewhat', 'bouncier', 'then', 'depressing', 'guy', 'own', 'spinoff.Then', 'have', 'Xander', 'witty', 'sarcastic', 'goof', 'hots', 'Buffy.Has', 'awesome', 'lines', 'stays', 'clear', 'shows', 'annoying', 'catch', 'phrase', 'dialogue.Finally', 'new', 'revamped', 'pun', 'intended', 'Buffy', 'Sarah', 'M', 'Gellar', 'hot', 'integrity', 'rare', 'such', 'tacky', 'role.She', 'series.Another', 'show', 'fact', 'future', 'series', 'self', 'contained', 'cliffhangers', 'end', 'make', 'need', 'next', 'season', 'follow', 'plot', 'line.The', 'quot', 'Freak', 'week', 'quot', 'format', 'used', 'show', 'Smallville', 'reason', 'supernatural', 'being', 'centralised', 'shows', 'base', 'town', 'quot', 'SunnyDale', 'quot', 'town', 'quot', 'Hellmouth', 'quot', 'Gate', 'hell', 'so', 'magnet', 'monsters.The', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'evil', 'nemesis', 'quot', 'Master', 'quot', 'weak', 'made', 'worse', 'poor', 'casting', 'villain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'thats', 'what', 'have', 'here.The', 'show', 'have', 'other', 'weak', 'characters', 'such', 'Willow', 'Maybe', 'were', 'lesbian', 'witch', 'later', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'would', 'have.All', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'enjoy', 'sort', 'thing.As', 'fan', 'program', 'Angel', 'recomendation', 'view', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'lead', 'next', 'show.After', 'season', '3', 'show', 'metaphorical', 'Hellmouth', 'what', 'as', 'fan', 'sci/horror', 'genre', 'call', 'quot', 'Supernatural', 'Soap', 'Opera', 'quot', 'enjoy', 'would', 'recommend', 'Kolchak', 'Night', 'Stalker']",N/A
564051,A3RR5ARVCZMKPH,B00005221I,Ian Krupnick,"[2, 3]","When Buffy was released on TV I was in the sixth grade and I thought it was stupid. Now I'm graduated from high school and am a bit wiser then the snobby little punk I once was. I Purchased the First season finding it at a 20 dollar price and I thought what the heck. I didn't know that I was heading into one of the most creative and well-done shows That I will ever find. I was just hoping for a laughThe gang is pretty much all assembled at the beginning. Buffy is the leader, Willow is the heart, Xander is the humor, Giles is the brain, Cordelia the popular girl we all knew and hated back in high school, and Angel the man no one really trusts. While it's easy to stereotype the characters in this fashion (and not totally inaccurate until Season 2 rolls around) each one does evolve gradually. These are all people that we knew and sat next to in class.The first season consists of twelve episodes that with a couple of exceptions are all carefree lighthearted monster of the week fare. What makes the episodes work so well is the imaginative way each monster is presented. All the characters find a bit o humor in the situations they so frequently seem to get placed in. And it's nice to get a comfortable feel for everything before it all goes to hell.What struck me most though while watching these episodes was the feel that those involved had might not have had a single clue what they were doing. It was a show that didn't really fit into any discernible genre on a network that was brand new with a budget that was freakishly low for some of the stories they were trying to pull off. But I really think it worked towards the shows advantage. The fact that everyone involved was learning as they went and that the effects are terrifically cheesy gives the show an organic quality. Plus it kind of doubles as a high school metaphor for the problems that we faced seemed to consume the world back then. Now those problems just seem like typical kid stuff when i look back.Well I'm now addicted, snatching up each box set with a fervor that causes my roommate to constantly be rolling his eyes (although He knows a lot of what happens through out the entire series.) some people will probably never be able to get beyond their precepts about it.

Before that, I was of the unfortunates that apparently lived in the Hellmouth and never wanted to see the light.True, the movie was not that great, but the series itself is excellent. What I thought would be a sappy, idiotic series for teenagers has turned out to be a very excellent drama that explores the pain of growing up, from highschool (seasons 1-3), college (season 4 and 5) and beyond (season 6). Even though it might seem to be tuned towards the teenager/high school generation, I find myself at age 35 enjoying this. In fact, there are at least 5 other people where I work that watch the show regularly and are about the same age as I. This show is definitely good for adults. Better than some of the other stuff out there.Life, death, love, are all explored. Every character of the Scooby Gang has flaws, but there are so many qualities that outshine those flaws, they're all loveable. And, no matter what, love and friendship wins in the end as they work together to battle the evil that spawns itself in Sunnydale, CA.The first season is well done and with the first episode, you already learn about the main characters very quickly, however you're only given so much so as to whet your appetite to learn more as the season goes on.The humor is placed at the right moments, and so many sayings just make you break out in laughter, easing the tension that builds as you watch the shows.The DVD is an excellent edition to start your Buffy collection. However, I'm now anxiously awaiting season 2, which is supposedly due out June 2002 on 6 DVDs (more episodes in the rest of the seasons - season one had only 12).There are interview clips with the creator, Josh Wheton and to learn about Mutant Enemy productions and the &quot;GRR ARGH&quot; monster is some neat trivia.Get it! You won't be disappointed.

With Buffy I lean on the fact that it was the beginning of one of the best 90's series, however, the series is still naive and innocent. Who would not love Sarah Michelle anyway? I do, passionately! The dark/doomy lights sorround them everywhere, haunting and heartless vampires can come from anywhere. The Watcher's British accent gives style to it and the different villains: possessed hienas, cyber demons, ''chuky'' vendetta toys and a gang of vampire soldiers give 100% entertainment to you.

Now this was not the best season by a long shot.  I don't think too many people even acknowledge this season.  What it does is set the groudwork for future seasons.  The plot and all the main characters are introduced nicely.  The key problem with this season: low budget.Now as many of you know, the series is based off a 1992 movie of the same name, starring Kristy Swanson, Luke Perry, and Donald Sutherland.  I haven't seen the movie, but I've heard it's horrible.  Taking that into account, it is surprising that this show was ever concieved.  Obviously, they didn't have a lot to work with.  As a result, there are many problems with the first season.  The costumes and makeup look kind of cheesy.  The action scenes are not very well choreographed.  I could be wrong, but I don't think many of the actors(with the exception of Anthony Stewart Head) had done much acting.  I didn't think the acting was horrible, but it's not excellent either.  The villian of this season, the master, is kind of lame.  I got real tired of his quips and attempts at being scary.  SPOILER ALERT.  His fight with Buffy at the end of the season did not make any sense.  How does Buffy easily kill the most powerful vampire on the planet when he easily killed her five minutes earlier?Even with problems like these, the season is still okay.  There were elements of this season that would get better with better writing and a bigger budget.  For example, I saw right away that Xander is supposed to be the funny comic relief guy.  Most of his little jokes weren't that funny in this season, but I could see that his delivery of those lines was excellent.  And in later seasons, he does become a very funny character.Overall, the season was okay.  It interested me enough to get me to watch the second season.

Little can be said about the episodes themselves, as they have become cult classics with a good reason.  The story is intriguing, the characters interesting, and it's fun to watch.  However, many of the functions on the DVDs themselves are bad.  For example, the navigation is poor.  There is no direct link from the main menu to special features.

564062,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B00005221I,James Hiller,"[0, 0]","I'm a Buffy novice. Watching only the movie last year, I had successfully avoided the Buffy phenom year after year. Perhaps it was the undue influence of a certain person that worshipped the shows as the best thing on. But it took my current boyfriend to turn me on to the Slayer and her gang of do-gooders that has made me a complete convert. I stand in the awe of Buffy.Since I have no other seasons with which to compare this first season, I must say this is a delectable, funny group of episodes. Setting the course of the show, Sarah Michelle Gellar proves her talent early on, giving Buffy the appropriate menace and high school angst. She clearly carries the show on her shoulders, yet carries that mantle with utmost professionalism. Her cohorts are equally compelling. Alyson Hannigan plays Willow, a self-confessed computer geek, with a sense of wonderful innocence. Nicholas Brendon gives Xander, a loveable loser, dignity.  Anthony Head's Giles, know-it-all librarian, is stuffy and fun.The twelve episodes stand up well, with only a couple of brain scratchers in the mix. The first two set up the series and its characters very well. Some of the favorites included the &quot;Angel&quot; episode, that finally helps solve the mystery of the character while seemingly adding more to it, and &quot;Nightmares&quot; where seemingly bad dreams enter reality. One particularly odd episode was &quot;The Pack&quot;, where hyenas seem to enter a group of students as they proceed to reign havoc over Sunnydale, but I didn't buy it.Overall, you can see the promise of this series in these early episodes. I was pleasantly surprised at the developing sense of humor that seemed to grow with each episode. I really enjoyed the comraderie between all the main characters, as they fight both those hideous Hellmouth demons and the trials and tribulations of puberty.

It may not be the best of the whole series but that's only when you compare it to the seasons that would later come. Even in the beginning anyone could see that this was the start of something truly great and special. What sets this first season from the later ones is that this one has a lot of heart. It's most visible during the incredible episode ""Angel"".There were a couple of episodes that weren't up to par with the rest, the worst being ""Teacher's Pet"" IMHO. But it made up for it with great episodes such as ""Angel"", ""The Pack"", ""Prophecy Girl"", ""Nightmares"" and ""Witch"".""The Puppet Show"" is an episode that I have a problem with solely for the fact that dummies scare me. I know it's silly but hey, we all have our things. Despite that I really enjoyed ""The Puppet Show"" and the dummy turned out to be the good guy here, so that helped. People have a problem with ""Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind"" but I have to disagree with them. I loved this episode. It has a lot of depth to it when you analyze it. I know there are many teenagers facing a problem similar to Marcie's minus the the whole becoming invisible part. But feeling lonely is a part of what being a teenager sometimes is.""I Robot, You Jane"" is such a good episode, I don't get why people complain about it. Watching it again now in the year 2005 is even funnier because of how high tech everything has become ever since that episode was first filmed and we all know that there have been some crazy cases with guys and girls alike being stalked by people they've met on the net.I think I must be the only person who didn't like at all ""Welcome to The Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"". Yes, it was what first drew me to the show when it first aired but compared to the rest of the season it just doesn't meet up.Also...am I the only one who had a problem with the little boy who was the Annointed One? I just don't see the point of having him there.

564068,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B00005221I,Jason A. Miller,"[3, 3]","""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was a critical hit in its first season on TV, airing in the spring of 1997 on the then-unproven WB Network.  The show wasn't a must-watch cultural phenomenon at that point, but I watched about half the episodes and knew at the time that something very special was waiting to be born here.  Happily, we were all proven right a year later.  Now that Season 1 is offred on DVD for the first time, the show's beginnings are as attractive as ever.The first 12 episodes fall into two categories:  light horror  (stories reminiscent of ""Twilight Zone"", ""X-Files"", and of course, ""Goosebumps""), and an epic season-long story arc.Shows like ""The Witch"" (the first episode I saw), ""The Pack"", ""Puppet Show"", and ""Out of Mind, Out of Sight"" (then known online as ""Invisible Girl"") follow the same format:  A creepy supernatural menace mirrors the Sunnydale High School kids' own insecurities.  These episodes do a fine job of introducing the small regular cast.  Cordelia is a shallow cheerleader who finds a heroic side.  Xander is a wannabe Lothario, and Willow just wants a date with him.  Buffy's mom is completely in the dark about her daughter's job as Slayer.  All these characters would grow and evolve in later season, and at times seem a little flat in the early going (especially Mrs. Summers, who'd grow in importance as the show moved along).  However, moments of real horror are present here, most notably the death of Principal Flutie in ""The Pack"".The remaining episodes trace a story arc:  an ancient evil, the vampire Master, is trapped in a fallen church under the school, and with the help of vampire minions -- and a child to lead them -- must break captivity and kill Buffy in order to reclaim the world.  Each story escalates in both tension, and significance to the arc.  In ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date"", Buffy slays vampires, but fails to notice the young Anointed One.  In ""Angel"", we learn that the tall, thin (though not anymore!) brooding stranger with the crush on Buffy was indeed a vampire himself.  ""Prophecy Girl"", the season finale, breaks all the rules by killing off not only the show's main villain, but also its heroine.The DVD's features are sparse and standard.  Of little interest are the photo gallery and previously-published pilot scripts.  Better are the recycled-from-VHS interviews with series creator Joss Whedon, short but revealing.  Most interesting is the Whedon commentary track on the two-episode pilot, offering revealing information (the school ""set"" was in fact one corridor, used several times; the entrance to The Bronze was in fact the exterior of the warehouse where ""Buffy"" is filmed) and wry humor.The best of ""Buffy"" is yet to come on DVD, and it would be welcome to see more commentary from Whedon and other production regulars, as well as from castmembers like Alyson Hannigan, the show's breakout character Willow, and Anthony Stuart Head, as the fussy librarian Giles who anchors the early shows with his store of occult knowledge and crisp tweed suit.  Still, there's a lot of mileage to enjoy from these first three discs.",5,"Still fresh, funny and scary",1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,3117,"['Vampire', 'Slayer', 'was', 'critical', 'hit', 'first', 'season', 'TV', 'airing', 'spring', '1997', 'then-unproven', 'WB', 'Network', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'must-watch', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'point', 'watched', 'episodes', 'knew', 'time', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'was', 'waiting', 'be', 'born', 'here', 'Happily', 'were', 'proven', 'year', 'later', 'Now', 'Season', '1', 'offred', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'show', 'beginnings', 'are', 'as', 'attractive', 'ever.The', 'first', '12', 'episodes', 'fall', 'two', 'categories', 'light', 'horror', 'stories', 'reminiscent', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'X-Files', 'course', 'Goosebumps', 'epic', 'season-long', 'story', 'arc.Shows', 'Witch', 'first', 'episode', 'saw', 'Pack', 'Puppet', 'Show', 'Out', 'Mind', 'Out', 'Sight', 'then', 'known', 'online', 'Invisible', 'Girl', 'follow', 'same', 'format', 'creepy', 'supernatural', 'menace', 'mirrors', 'Sunnydale', 'High', 'School', 'kids', 'own', 'insecurities', 'episodes', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'introducing', 'small', 'regular', 'cast', 'Cordelia', 'shallow', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'heroic', 'side', 'Xander', 'wannabe', 'Lothario', 'Willow', 'just', 'date', 'Buffy', 'mom', 'completely', 'dark', 'daughter', 'job', 'Slayer', 'characters', 'would', 'grow', 'evolve', 'later', 'season', 'times', 'seem', 'little', 'flat', 'early', 'going', 'especially', 'Mrs.', 'Summers', 'who', ""'d"", 'grow', 'importance', 'show', 'moved', 'along', 'However', 'moments', 'real', 'horror', 'are', 'present', 'here', 'most', 'notably', 'death', 'Principal', 'Flutie', 'Pack', '.The', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'trace', 'story', 'arc', 'ancient', 'evil', 'vampire', 'Master', 'trapped', 'fallen', 'church', 'school', 'help', 'vampire', 'minions', 'child', 'lead', 'must', 'break', 'captivity', 'kill', 'Buffy', 'order', 'reclaim', 'world', 'story', 'tension', 'significance', 'arc', 'Never', 'Kill', 'Boy', 'First', 'Date', 'Buffy', 'vampires', 'notice', 'young', 'Anointed', 'One', 'Angel', 'learn', 'tall', 'thin', 'not', 'anymore', 'brooding', 'stranger', 'crush', 'Buffy', 'was', 'indeed', 'vampire', 'Prophecy', 'Girl', 'season', 'finale', 'rules', 'killing', 'off', 'not', 'only', 'show', 'main', 'villain', 'also', 'heroine.The', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'sparse', 'standard', 'little', 'interest', 'are', 'photo', 'gallery', 'previously-published', 'pilot', 'scripts', 'Better', 'are', 'recycled-from-VHS', 'interviews', 'series', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'short', 'revealing', 'Most', 'interesting', 'Whedon', 'commentary', 'track', 'two-episode', 'pilot', 'offering', 'revealing', 'information', 'school', 'set', 'was', 'fact', 'one', 'corridor', 'used', 'several', 'times', 'entrance', 'Bronze', 'was', 'fact', 'exterior', 'warehouse', 'where', 'Buffy', 'filmed', 'humor.The', 'best', 'Buffy', 'yet', 'come', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'see', 'more', 'commentary', 'Whedon', 'other', 'production', 'regulars', 'as', 'well', 'castmembers', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'show', 'breakout', 'character', 'Willow', 'Anthony', 'Stuart', 'Head', 'fussy', 'librarian', 'Giles', 'who', 'anchors', 'early', 'shows', 'store', 'occult', 'knowledge', 'crisp', 'tweed', 'suit', 'Still', 'lot', 'mileage', 'enjoy', 'first', 'three', 'discs']",N/A
564069,A2CEX7784M8YSU,B00005221I,Jeffery Bauman,"[1, 1]","October 10, 2006. The day I first saw ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" and was introduced to the Best Television Show Ever. Forgive the enthusiasm, but anyone who has seen this show can surely understand. ""Buffy"" is brilliant, enough said. For the uninitiated (like I was), Season One is the ideal place to start. The audience is introduced to Buffy Summers (the brilliant Sarah Michelle Gellar), Willow Rosenburg (Alyson Hannigan), Xander Harris (Nicholas Brenden), the dark, brooding Angel (David Boreanaz), Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), and Rupert Giles (Anthony Steward Head). Creator Joss Whedon took the phrase ""high school is hell,"" and created situations that are direct metaphors for what all teenagers go through. Season One is all set-up, however, for the brilliance to come. This season is the perfect primer. The audience gets to know the characters, the witty dialogue is on full display, and the audience is ready to jump head-first into emotional journey to come beginning in season two. Season One is written like a very long miniseries. This is because ""Buffy"" was a mid-season replacement, and noone knew if there would be a second season, let alone seven. The season finale, ""Prophecy Girl"" could be a series finale of sorts. The big bad is slain, and everything ends happily. If you have not seen this yet, SEE IT NOW!! If you like Season One (and who wouldn't?), you'll LOVE the rest of the series. Here I will rate every episode followed by a rating. A star (*) means this episode is an absolute must see.1.

Meaning, it's like real life, but more entertaining.  Teenage angst takes on a whole new meaning in this show.  Joss Whedons' stories about a little blonde cheerleader who is suddenly given the responsibility of saving the world day in and day out are exciting, action packed, touching, emotional and surprisingly close to real life on many levels.  Dealing with teenage angst is tough for all young people, the fact that Buffy is given the added pressure of fighting Vampires and demons puts her regular high school life in perspective.  She realizes she would give anything to be just a good student, a cheerleader and have social time at the mall and the local club.  But nothing comes that easy.  Life gives us responsibilities and Whedon seems to know this without question.  He throws everything he can at our tough little heroine and she seems to take it all in stride, sometimes not as gracefully as others.  Along the way she finds friends in unlikely students, geeks.  Where in the movie, which afterward is where the TV Show picks up, she would never have socialized with these kind of people, she finds herself gaining solace in their normality and more honest personalities.  BTVS cannot be described by in a short sentence or two.  The characters, story arcs, themes and even the villains have long term affects.  The individual stories stand alone, but as a whole, the show ties itself together in several ways.  This DVD is worth the money for the shows alone, the extra features only make it that much more exceptional.",5,Growing up was never this scary...,1011312000,"01 18, 2002",2002,1643,"['Vampire', 'Slayer', 'one', 'most', 'reflective', 'pieces', 'modern', 'life', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'created', 'Meaning', 'real', 'life', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Teenage', 'angst', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'show', 'Joss', 'Whedons', 'stories', 'little', 'blonde', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'suddenly', 'given', 'responsibility', 'saving', 'world', 'day', 'day', 'out', 'are', 'exciting', 'action', 'packed', 'touching', 'emotional', 'surprisingly', 'close', 'real', 'life', 'many', 'levels', 'Dealing', 'teenage', 'angst', 'tough', 'young', 'people', 'fact', 'Buffy', 'given', 'added', 'pressure', 'fighting', 'Vampires', 'demons', 'regular', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'perspective', 'would', 'give', 'anything', 'be', 'just', 'good', 'student', 'cheerleader', 'have', 'social', 'time', 'mall', 'local', 'club', 'nothing', 'easy', 'Life', 'responsibilities', 'Whedon', 'know', 'question', 'everything', 'can', 'tough', 'little', 'heroine', 'take', 'stride', 'sometimes', 'not', 'as', 'gracefully', 'others', 'way', 'friends', 'unlikely', 'students', 'geeks', 'Where', 'movie', 'afterward', 'where', 'TV', 'Show', 'up', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'socialized', 'kind', 'people', 'gaining', 'solace', 'normality', 'more', 'honest', 'personalities', 'BTVS', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'described', 'short', 'sentence', 'two', 'characters', 'story', 'arcs', 'themes', 'even', 'villains', 'have', 'long', 'term', 'affects', 'individual', 'stories', 'stand', 'alone', 'whole', 'show', 'together', 'several', 'ways', 'DVD', 'money', 'shows', 'alone', 'extra', 'features', 'only', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'exceptional']",N/A

She also meets Angel but doesn't realize he's a vampire at first. All this happens in the 2 hour pilot which is very entertaining by the way. I love the whole big battle at the bronze at the end.Well anyway this season is good start, haven't seen it until recently on the FX channel. I must say it's pretty cool. My favorite would have to be the nightmare episode where all their nightmares become a reality, now that ones really cool. Not as good as Hush in season 4 but still good. Besides that Xander has a crush on Buffy but she doesn't like him that way...poor guy, at least he has Anya now. Oh wait he left her at the Alter, lol.The Villian in the first season is the Master who is stuck underground and needs other vampires to do his dirty work. If Slayer dies he will be free!.

564079,A3AFNUPOSK2QGV,B00005221I,"Joe Kenney ""buttergun""","[1, 2]","I've been known to knock Buffy over the past few years, but here's a dirty little secret: I regularly followed the series throughout its first four seasons.  I was one of the maybe 10 people nationwide who actually watched the premiere episode on its March 1997 airdate, and while I wasn't knocked out, I was entertained enough that I continued watching the show for the next four years.  It was only later that I got sick of the show (a story for another day), but I guess you could say that, despite its weaknesses, Season 1 of Buffy was strong enough to make me a fan of the series.So why do I knock Buffy these days?  Mostly because of the impact it had on other TV programs, particularly ""Alias.""  Buffy takes place in a fantasy world, with vampires and monsters and ""chosen ones,"" and that's fine, because these things are accepted in this fantasy world.  However, when a series like ""Alias,"" which is supposed to be more realistic, starts having its main character fend off multiple attackers with stunt-doubled high-kicks and also discovers she herself is a ""chosen one,"" I begin to have problems.  There are other reasons I've made fun of Buffy over the past few years, but, having just re-watched the first season, I've realized they're all moot.  Buffy is a fun show, one that never takes itself too seriously (unlike ""Alias""), and entertainment is its prime directive.Everyone will tell you the same thing: Season 1 is good, but Buffy gets much better later on.  That's true, but there's no need to dampen Season 1's entertainment value.  Each first season episode pretty much operates like a ""monster of the week"" special, and there are no season-long arcs, like we'd get in later seasons.  Instead, this season focuses on setting up the characters, the stories, and the strange hellmouth that Sunnydale rests on.  Comedy is more important than most anything else, and even the martial arts sequences, which the show soon became known for, are a bit underdeveloped.  In a way, each of these Season 1 episodes are like an amateur director's first film: a bit awkward at times, a little rough around the edges, but always full of energy.The two-part pilot is probably the best of the bunch, and if I remember it right, it was actually a two-hour premiere back in the day, but here on disc it's presented as two separate episodes.  Written by series creator Joss Whedon (who didn't start to direct until later in the season), you can tell the producers had some time to film this episode, as it features more set-ups, pans, fades, and other assorted directorial ""tricks"" than later Season 1 episodes.  Proving again how quickly this season moves, our entire cast of characters is introduced within a handful of minutes; these are the people who will carry the show for seven seasons, and in no time at all we've met them and know how they work.  An impressive bit of storytelling that just about any screenwriter could learn from.  Beyond that, this episode works like a film in itself, introducing the Master, Season 1's main villain.The other episodes this season are a bit scattered, some strong (""Angel""), some weak (""I Robot, You Jane"").  Since Buffy was a mid-season replacement, there are only 12 episodes, and The Master doesn't feature into the season's grander scheme as later main villains would.  Instead, he mostly sulks in his lair, awaiting the season finale; not your most compelling villain.  There are episodes that spotlight Buffy's circle of friends, like ""The Pack,"" which features Xander descending into hyena territory (a good episode, other than those VERY annoying hyena-cries Xander and pals keep making), and ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind,"" which adds more depth to snooty Cordelia (and also has a nice Beatles reference in the final shot).The cast is strong, stronger than any low-budget supernatural/comedy thriller should be entitled to.  Whedon and his co-producers were either lucky or blessed when they pieced this cast together.  If you only judge Sarah Michelle Gellar from feature film debacles like ""Practical Magic"" or ""Scooby-Doo,"" then you don't know what this talented actress is capable of.  Like most others, during Season 1's initial airing it was Willow who appealed to me, but watching these episodes again, I found Buffy much more appealing, which was no doubt due to Gellar's portrayal and talents.  And that's not even getting into the physical aspect!  Seriously though, in later seasons Buffy was a bit more fierce and grim (sort of like a young Linda Hamilton), but in these first season episodes she's the definition of nubile.  She's also a bit more high-spirited, something that was lost later on.  I can safely say that most guys watching this season will find themselves falling hard for Ms. Summers/Gellar.The rest of the cast is just as great: there's Alyson Hannigan as Willow, every fanboy's dream girl.  A living Japanimation character, the fan community accepted her with open arms.  This season doesn't give her the chance to show off her acting chops like later seasons would, but she's impressive and likeable regardless.  Nicholas Brendon is Xander Harris, my favorite character on the show (until Spike arrives, that is), but on my recent rewatching of the season, I didn't like him as much as before.  Maybe that's because I realized Xander (and, to an extent, just about every other character on the show) talks and acts just like Chandler from ""Friends.""  Do a side-by-side comparison, and you'll see what I mean.  Joss Whedon is worshiped by some for his gift for dialog and storytelling, but in many ways, he apparently lifted a LOT from the character of Chandler.Next we have Anthony Stewart Head as the stuffy Watcher Giles, and he's great here, but again gets more opportunity in later seasons.  Then there's Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia; funny character, good acting, but a mere shadow of what the character would later become.  And on top of that, Carpenter looks nothing like a teenager, I don't know who the producers thought they were fooling.  Finally we have David Boreanaz as Angel.  The funny thing here is how much more interesting and impressive this actor/character became over the following years, because honestly Boreanaz isn't that strong of an actor this first time out, and his character as well soon was given a lot more depth.Visually, the show looks pretty good.  Even though it was shot on 16mm film, the lighting and cinematography are so professional and well-done that you'd never notice.  The sets are a bit cheap at times, as are the special effects and monster makeup, but not so bad as to ruin your enjoyment of the show.  The soundtrack is low-budget as well; most of it sounds like it was recorded on a demo keyboard at the local RadioShack.The DVD release is fullscreen, but as Whedon has constantly pointed out, Buffy was framed for fullscreen presentation throughout its seven-season run.  So in other words, Buffy in fullscreen is the way the show was intended to be seen.  There's some grain on the print, and some of the night scenes are murky, but this is the fault of the 16mm source print, rather than a DVD flaw.  The extras are passable, if a bit bareboned.  Whedon provides commentary for the first two episodes, relating all sorts of information about the series.  However, it sort of sounds like he's trying to suppress a belch throughout, which is disturbing.  There are also some interviews with Whedon and Boreanaz, as well as a few features with Whedon talking about the individual episodes.  No deleted scenes or making-of documentaries; that doesn't come until later season boxsets.Like I said above, despite the low-budget limitations in its first season, Buffy is still a legitimately entertaining and high-spirited series, and I can't think of any other show, other than the Simpsons, that tried so hard to maintain and reward its fan base over the course of its run.  Give Buffy a try.  Regardless of your reservations, you'll more than likely find yourself hooked on it, and you can rest assured that the series just gets better and better.  And this is coming from a guy who generally can't stand monster/vampire flicks.",4,"Low budget, high thrills",1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,8162,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'known', 'knock', 'Buffy', 'past',

564082,AM8K619L97JWR,B00005221I,Joseph Rodriguez,"[61, 62]","Finally, the complete first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is available on DVD (rather than the boxed set previously available that contained only half of the episodes). While a little uneven in quality compared to later, more polished seasons, the series' trademark wit and pathos are in fine form in this set.The set begins with the two-part series premiere, &quot;Welcome to the Hellmouth&quot; and &quot;The Harvest.&quot; These episodes introduce Buffy, a sophomore in high school and the Slayer chosen to fight the forces of darkness; Willow, the shy technology-savvy redhead; Xander, the goofy regular guy who happens to have a serious crush on the Buffster; Cordelia, the shallow queen always ready with an acerbic comment; and Giles, the staid school librarian and Buffy's watcher. Some important secondary characters are also introduced, like Angel, Buffy's future boyfriend, and Darla, Angel's vampiric ex-flame. The storyline involves the plans of the Master, a vampire, to escape his prison and wreak havoc at the same time that Buffy has just transferred to a new school (after being kicked out of her old one for burning down the gym). Naturally, she and her friends avert the catastrophe.&quot;The Witch&quot; is a great episode, looking at both mother/daughter relationships and being pressured by parents to succeed. When the cheerleading squad meets various mystical &quot;accidents,&quot; one-by-one, Buffy has to investigate. The trail apparently leads to Amy Madison, a gawky girl turned second-string cheerleader. She's moving up the ranks as her competitors go down... One of the best episodes in the set.&quot;Teacher's Pet&quot; features Xander, as he and all the other guys go gaga for a new substitute teacher. But Buffy's suspicious when she sees the teacher do a head-twist, Exorcist-style. Unfortunately, Xander's already in her trap...&quot;Never Kill a Boy on the First Date&quot; is a more humorous episode. Buffy tries to have a social life, but those pesky slaying commitments keep getting in the way. She finally ends up dragging her date to the funeral home when they find that an ancient prophecy is coming to pass...In &quot;Angel,&quot; the mysterious Angel's secret is revealed: he's a vampire! (As if it were a surprise to anyone.) But when Buffy thinks he's fed on her mother, she has to make a decision: can she bring herself to kill him?The spotlight's on Willow in &quot;I Robot, You Jane.&quot; When introspective Will starts an online romance, Buffy's a little worried. But when it turns out that there's a demon in the Internet - and that he's Willow's &quot;boyfriend&quot; - things get particularly hairy. This episode introduces computer teacher and technopagan Jenny Calendar, Giles' sometimes girlfriend and a pivotal character in Season Two.&quot;The Puppet Show&quot; is the series' token creepy-ventriloquist's-dummy episode. Giles has been drafted for the school talent show, but several of the participants have turned up rather dead. Buffy suspects one of the stranger kids' ventriloquist dummy is behind the deaths. Though this episode is not the strongest of the season, an enjoyable and unexpected twist makes it still eminently watchable.In &quot;The Pack,&quot; Xander's started to act funny - snarling at his friends and hanging out with the bullies. It all started when he entered the hyena cage at the zoo. But can Buffy figure it out before things get out of hand and somebody gets...well, eaten?&quot;Nightmares&quot; brings everyone's worst nightmares to life. Buffy's father tells her he doesn't love her, while bookworm Giles forgets how to read. The Master seizes the opportunity to try to make a break for the outside world, and nearly succeeds. Worth it if for nothing but Cordelia's bad hair day.In &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight,&quot; an invisible girl is terrorizing Cordelia and her associates. She comes to Buffy for help, and Buffy gives it (albeit very reluctantly). But when the attacks coincide with the crowning of Cordelia as the new May Queen, problems arise - big surprise.The set ends on a high note with &quot;Prophecy Girl.&quot; Giles finds a prophecy that predicts Buffy's death at the hands of the Master. It deals very clearly with Buffy's bleak realization of her own mortality, and ends with a showstopping showdown between Buffy and the Master. Quite possibly the best episode in this set.I can't recommend this boxed set highly enough. Extras, like interviews with Joss Whedon (the creator) and David Boreanaz (Angel) round out the set. A worthwhile purchase both for Buffy fans and those wanting to see what the fuss is all about.",5,It's about time!,1005609600,"11 13, 2001",2001,4638,"['Finally', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'available', 'DVD', 'rather', 'boxed', 'set', 'previously', 'available', 'contained', 'only', 'half', 'episodes', 'little', 'uneven', 'quality', 'compared', 'later', 'more', 'polished', 'seasons', 'series', 'trademark', 'wit', 'pathos', 'are', 'fine', 'form', 'set.The', 'set', 'two-part', 'series', 'premiere', 'quot', 'Welcome', 'Hellmouth', 'quot', 'quot', 'Harvest.', 'quot', 'episodes', 'introduce', 'Buffy', 'sophomore', 'high', 'school', 'Slayer', 'chosen', 'fight', 'forces', 'darkness', 'Willow', 'shy', 'technology-savvy', 'redhead', 'Xander', 'goofy', 'regular', 'guy', 'who', 'have', 'serious', 'crush', 'Buffster', 'Cordelia', 'shallow', 'queen', 'always', 'ready', 'acerbic', 'comment', 'Giles', 'staid', 'school', 'librarian', 'Buffy', 'watcher', 'important', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'future', 'boyfriend', 'Darla', 'Angel', 'vampiric', 'ex-flame', 'storyline', 'plans', 'Master', 'vampire', 'escape', 'prison', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'same', 'time', 'Buffy', 'just', 'transferred', 'new', 'school', 'being', 'kicked', 'old', 'one', 'burning', 'down', 'gym', 'Naturally', 'friends', 'avert', 'catastrophe.', 'quot', 'Witch', 'quot', 'great', 'episode', 'looking', 'mother/daughter', 'relationships', 'being', 'pressured', 'parents', 'succeed', 'When', 'cheerleading', 'squad', 'meets', 'various', 'mystical', 'quot', 'accidents', 'quot', 'one-by-one', 'Buffy', 'investigate', 'trail', 'apparently', 'Amy', 'Madison', 'gawky', 'girl', 'turned', 'second-string', 'cheerleader', 'moving', 'up', 'ranks', 'competitors', 'go', 'down', 'One', 'best', 'episodes', 'set.', 'quot', 'Teacher', 'Pet', 'quot', 'features', 'Xander', 'other', 'guys', 'go', 'gaga', 'new', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'Buffy', 'suspicious', 'when', 'teacher', 'do', 'head-twist', 'Exorcist-style', 'Unfortunately', 'Xander', 'already', 'trap', 'quot', 'Never', 'Kill', 'Boy', 'First', 'Date', 'quot', 'more', 'humorous', 'episode', 'Buffy', 'have', 'social', 'life', 'pesky', 'slaying', 'commitments', 'keep', 'getting', 'way', 'finally', 'up', 'dragging', 'date', 'funeral', 'home', 'when', 'find', 'ancient', 'prophecy', 'coming', 'pass', 'quot', 'Angel', 'quot', 'mysterious', 'Angel', 'secret', 'revealed', 'vampire', 'were', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'when', 'Buffy', 'fed', 'mother', 'make', 'decision', 'can', 'bring', 'kill', 'spotlight', 'Willow', 'quot', 'Robot', 'Jane.', 'quot', 'When', 'introspective', 'Will', 'online', 'romance', 'Buffy', 'little', 'worried', 'when', 'out', 'demon', 'Internet', 'Willow', 'quot', 'quot', 'things', 'get', 'particularly', 'hairy', 'episode', 'computer', 'teacher', 'technopagan', 'Jenny', 'Calendar', 'Giles', 'sometimes', 'girlfriend', 'pivotal', 'character', 'Season', 'Two.', 'quot', 'Puppet', 'Show', 'quot', 'series', 'token', ""creepy-ventriloquist's-dummy"", 'episode', 'Giles', 'been', 'drafted', 'school', 'talent', 'show', 'several', 'participants', 'have', 'turned', 'up', 'rather', 'dead', 'Buffy', 'one', 'stranger', 'kids', 'ventriloquist', 'dummy', 'deaths', 'episode', 'not', 'strongest', 'season', 'enjoyable', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'still', 'eminently', 'watchable.In', 'quot', 'Pack', 'quot', 'Xander', 'started', 'act', 'funny', 'snarling', 'friends', 'hanging', 'out', 'bullies', 'started', 'when', 'entered', 'hyena', 'cage', 'zoo', 'can', 'Buffy', 'figure', 'out', 'things', 'get', 'hand', 'somebody', 'well', 'eaten', 'quot', 'Nightmares', 'quot', 'everyone', 'worst', 'nightmares', 'life', 'Buffy', 'father', ""n't"", 'love', 'bookworm', 'Giles', 'how', 'read', 'Master', 'opportunity', 'try', 'make', 'break', 'outside', 'world', 'nearly', 'nothing', 'Cordelia', 'bad', 'hair', 'day.In', 'quot', 'Out', 'Mind', 'Out', 'Sight', 'quot', 'invisible', 'girl', 'terrorizing', 'Cordelia', 'associates', 'Buffy', 'help', 'Buffy', 'albeit', 'very', 'reluctantly', 'when', 'attacks', 'coincide', 'crowning', 'Cordelia', 'new', 'May', 'Queen', 'problems', 'arise', 'big', 'surprise.The', 'set', 'high', 'note', 'quot', 'Prophecy', 'Girl.', 'quot', 'Giles', 'prophecy', 'Buffy', 'death', 'hands', 'Master', 'very', 'clearly', 'Buffy', 'bleak', 'realization', 'own', 'mortality', 'showstopping', 'showdown', 'Buffy', 'Master', 'Quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'episode', 'set.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'boxed', 'set', 'highly', 'enough', 'Extras', 'interviews', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'creator', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Angel', 'round', 'out', 'set', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'Buffy', 'fans', 'wanting', 'see', 'what', 'fuss']",N/A

Joss has created a show that is called by critics ""Hip"" and ""Imaginative"" and "". . . with a sense of style."" The show is all of that, but much much more to its brigade of fans around the world. Including me. I've been a fan ever since the first season, which is now presented in this crazy thing we call DVD.Buffy the Vampire Slayer's premise is familiar to almost everyone. It's about Buffy Summers, a girl who was born with the birth right of being the Slayer. One girl in all the world who must destroy the forces of darkness until her death. After burning down her high school gym in LA which was infested with vampires, she and her mother move to Sunnydale, CA where life is supposed be a fresh start. But nothing's that fresh in a Slayer's life. Buffy soon meets up with Xander, Willow, and Giles who become her Slayerettes and aid her in her battles. Along the way we are also introduced to Cordelia and Jenny Calendar, who even in small ways, help Buffy along the way.Joss and co. set a mighty firm foundation for the show with its first season. The mood is right, the soundtrack is awesome, and his cast of mostly unknown talent is freshly recieved. Sarah Michelle Gellar, as the lead role, perfected the character of Buffy from the first scene. Her acting is superb. Alyson Hannigan and Nicholas Brendon are her companions Willow and Xander. Each gave depth to their character in only the first episode. Anthony Stewart Head and Kristine Sutherland balance the show with being the grown ups, and not being over grown uppish. Tony Head is excellent as Buffy's Watcher, Giles. Rounding out the first season's main cast is Charisma Carpenter and Robia La Morte. Charisma perfected her role as the snobby Cordelia, and you couldn't help but fall in love with Robia as Jenny Calendar.The DVD's picture and sound is the best it can be since Buffy was originally shot on 16mm. The commentaries are very interesting to those who are fans of the show. Joss gives little snippets on ideas that were thrown away and other interesting facts about behind-the-scenes stuff. There are also interviews with Joss and David Boreanaz. A Buffy trailer, picture gallery, and the script for the Pilot are also available.Buffy the Vampire Slayer, now in its 6th season, is still going strong. There have been many new faces to come and go, and many new intelligent storylines. I'm sure there are many still to come.",5,Loyal Fan Am I to This Great Series,1013299200,"02 10, 2002",2002,2506,"['Could', 'anyone', 'have', 'mastered', 'tv', 'series', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'Joss', 'created', 'show', 'called', 'critics', 'Hip', 'Imaginative', 'sense', 'style', 'show', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'brigade', 'fans', 'world', 'Including', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'ever', 'first', 'season', 'now', 'presented', 'crazy', 'thing', 'call', 'DVD.Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'premise', 'familiar', 'almost', 'everyone', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'birth', 'right', 'being', 'Slayer', 'One', 'girl', 'world', 'who', 'must', 'destroy', 'forces', 'darkness', 'death', 'burning', 'down', 'high', 'school', 'gym', 'LA', 'was', 'infested', 'vampires', 'mother', 'move', 'Sunnydale', 'CA', 'where', 'life', 'supposed', 'be', 'fresh', 'start', 'nothing', 'fresh', 'Slayer', 'life', 'Buffy', 'soon', 'up', 'Xander', 'Willow', 'Giles', 'who', 'become', 'Slayerettes', 'aid', 'battles', 'way', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'Cordelia', 'Jenny', 'Calendar', 'who', 'even', 'small', 'ways', 'help', 'Buffy', 'way.Joss', 'co.', 'set', 'mighty', 'firm', 'foundation', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'mood', 'right', 'soundtrack', 'awesome', 'cast', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'talent', 'freshly', 'recieved', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'lead', 'role', 'perfected', 'character', 'Buffy', 'first', 'scene', 'acting', 'superb', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'are', 'companions', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'gave', 'depth', 'character', 'only', 'first', 'episode', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'Kristine', 'Sutherland', 'balance', 'show', 'being', 'grown', 'ups', 'not', 'being', 'grown', 'uppish', 'Tony', 'Head', 'excellent', 'Buffy', 'Watcher', 'Giles', 'Rounding', 'out', 'first', 'season', 'main', 'cast', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'Robia', 'La', 'Morte', 'Charisma', 'perfected', 'role', 'snobby', 'Cordelia', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'Robia', 'Jenny', 'Calendar.The', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'Buffy', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', '16mm', 'commentaries', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'show', 'Joss', 'little', 'snippets', 'ideas', 'were', 'thrown', 'away', 'other', 'interesting', 'facts', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stuff', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'Joss', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'A', 'Buffy', 'trailer', 'picture', 'gallery', 'script', 'Pilot', 'are', 'also', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'now', '6th', 'season', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'new', 'come', 'go', 'many', 'new', 'intelligent', 'storylines', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'many', 'still', 'come']",N/A

564088,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,B00005221I,J. SHARP,"[4, 5]","Season 1 of BTVS is often maligned for its cheap production values and effects, muddy look, and often cheesy stories (Not campy! Creator Joss Whedon hates camp.) But you must remember that Whedon was operating on a shoestring budget then. A series based on a failed feature film - with one of the most improbable titles ever conceived - did not motivate the networks to open up the coffers and dump money into it. It's shot on 16mm film (just a notch above the old home movie cameras) and this is awfully apparent in the nighttime sequences. I have no problem with all these quirks.The only downside of the first season is that Whedon and his writing team were still exploring the possibilities of the show. BTVS's one-sentence description - A metaphorical depiction of high school life and female empowerment - left things wide open for material. The initial detours into weekly monsters in mediocre getups were still a bit too literal and the season-long villain arc was forced at times, but there were moments of brilliance peeking through with each successive episode. Glimpses of future character dynamics and the slayer mythos were taking hold by this season's end and would absolutely blast off early in the next. And the patented Whedonesque dialogue sprinkled with pop culture quips and character-based syntax gets started even sooner.Season 1 is not among the best seasons (I think 3 is best, followed closely by 2) but it's certainly a necessary part of the Buffyverse.

564089,AA3UIRH39FZ7P,B00005221I,"J. Sheldon ""falcon710""","[6, 7]","First off, if you have seen the film version of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" don't hold that against this show.  This show ignores the existence of the film and starts over again (Thank God).This 12 episode set (Buffy was a mid-season replacement) starts with Buffy Summers (the ""chosen one"" or ""vampire slayer"") moving to Sunnydale High School after being kicked out of her last high school for burning down the gym (fighting vampires of course).  There, she meets up with her new ""Watcher"" Rupert Giles, and fellow high school students Xander, Willow, and Cordellia.  Together, the gang fights the forces of evil that gather around the Hellmouth that lies under the town of Sunnydale.What's great about this show, especially in the early seasons, is its mixture of action/drama and comedy.  The comedy is not slapstick, like in the film.  Rather, the comedy is the witty banter that occurs between all the characters.  It's never enough that you don't take the danger the characters are in seriously.  Instead, it just lightens the mood and makes you laugh.  The later seasons seemed to lose some of this wit, becoming much more darker and sinister, but the earlier seasons are free from this.  Also, the first season is a more episodic format, with each episode being a self-contained story (although if you watched them out of order, there are some references that you may not understand).  It was not until the later seasons that season-long story arcs were used that tied the whole season together.The action is first rate in this show.  Perhaps the only thing about this show that surpasses the action is the superb writing from Joss Whedon.  If you liked Buffy on television, you should start up a DVD collection.

I watched it from day 1 and have never looked back.  What is it about ""Buffy"" that speaks to so many people from so many disparate backgrounds?  It isn't just a show about fighting vampires; it isn't only about being a teenager; it isn't just about fighting the forces of Darkness - yet it is all of these things and more.  ""Buffy"" encompasses humor, horror, angst, drama, romance - in other words, life.  Joss Whedon created an intricate world and kept it rolling - kept it alive.Season One was a mid-season replacement, so it came in at a bit of a disadvantage - other shows were already emplaced, already had an audience and fans.  However, ""Buffy"" had a presence that brought people in.  Right away it was obvious that this was not going to be your mother's vampire show - the teaser opening was a cute little blond girl and a big guy coming into the high school at night - spooky spooky!  The girl is scared and unsure - the guy is macho and somewhat bullying.  Watch out, little girl, right?  WRONG!  The little girl is Darla, a powerful vampire - somewhere in the vicinity of 400 years old - who proceeds to kill the guy.  The next day, Buffy enters into her new high school.  We are quickly introduced to the main players - Cordelia, the rich and popular queen of the school quickly works to befriend the new girl from LA.  Xander and Jesse, the geeky guys, try to get her to notice them - Xander does this by actually running into her in the hall.  Willow is the brains; after Buffy sees Willow being put down by Cordelia, Buffy approaches Willow for help with her school work.  We see the beginning of the Scooby Gang form.  Then Buffy goes to the library, where she is accosted by Giles, who was put there to be her Watcher.  Of course, Buffy doesn't want to be a Slayer anymore - why would she?  It ruined her life in LA, got her kicked out of school and she had to move here to Sunnydale, butt-end of nowhere.  Of course, vampires don't care for the desires of school girls and there is a nasty vampire underneath the town - the Master, he is called - waiting for a chance to break free and take over the world.Thus Season One begins.  Buffy takes on more than vampires in Season One, of course - she takes on witches, Incan mummy girls, giant praying mantis ladies, living nightmares, invisible girls, etc.  In some ways it is a bit uneven, as our heroes find their way into their roles.  In other ways, it is the best season of them all, because it is all so new and wonderful.  We watch Cordelia develop from a one-dimensional Queen B to a multi-faceted member of the group (albeit somewhat reluctant member of the group).The box set doesn't have quite as many bells and whistles as some of the newer ones, but there are some nice commentaries on some of the episodes.  Unfortunately, once you turn on a commentary for one episode, it is on for the entire disk unless you turn off the DVD player, remove the DVD, put something else in for awhile and then put it back in, which is a bit annoying - it would be nice if you would turn the commentaries back off as well.  Something I would love to see more of - in ALL the seasons - is more outtakes.  Everyone loves outtakes but only one of the seasons has any outtake reels on it (I believe it is on the Season 4 disks but I might be mistaken).There is more to ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" than meets the eye - don't miss it.",5,"What is it about ""Buffy?""",1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,3492,"['will', 'never', 'forget', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'television', 'version', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'watched', 'day', '1', 'have', 'never', 'looked', 'back', 'What', 'Buffy', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'so', 'many', 'disparate', 'backgrounds', ""n't"", 'just', 'show', 'fighting', 'vampires', ""n't"", 'only', 'being', 'teenager', ""n't"", 'just', 'fighting', 'forces', 'Darkness', 'yet', 'things', 'more', 'Buffy', 'humor', 'horror', 'angst', 'drama', 'romance', 'other', 'words', 'life', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'created', 'intricate', 'world', 'kept', 'rolling', 'kept', 'alive.Season', 'One', 'was', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'came', 'bit', 'disadvantage', 'other', 'shows', 'were', 'already', 'emplaced', 'already', 'had', 'audience', 'fans', 'However', 'Buffy', 'had', 'presence', 'brought', 'people', 'Right', 'away', 'was', 'obvious', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'mother', 'vampire', 'show', 'teaser', 'opening', 'was', 'cute', 'little', 'blond', 'girl', 'big', 'guy', 'coming', 'high', 'school', 'night', 'spooky', 'spooky', 'girl', 'scared', 'unsure', 'guy', 'macho', 'somewhat', 'bullying', 'Watch', 'out', 'little', 'girl', 'right', 'WRONG', 'little', 'girl', 'Darla', 'powerful', 'vampire', 'somewhere', 'vicinity', '400', 'years', 'old', 'who', 'kill', 'guy', 'next', 'day', 'Buffy', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'quickly', 'introduced', 'main', 'players', 'Cordelia', 'rich', 'popular', 'queen', 'school', 'quickly', 'befriend', 'new', 'girl', 'LA', 'Xander', 'Jesse', 'geeky', 'guys', 'try', 'get', 'notice', 'Xander', 'actually', 'running', 'hall', 'Willow', 'brains', 'Buffy', 'being', 'put', 'down', 'Cordelia', 'Buffy', 'Willow', 'help', 'school', 'work', 'see', 'beginning', 'Scooby', 'Gang', 'form', 'Then', 'Buffy', 'library', 'where', 'accosted', 'Giles', 'who', 'was', 'put', 'there', 'be', 'Watcher', 'course', 'Buffy', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'Slayer', 'anymore', 'why', 'would', 'ruined', 'life', 'LA', 'got', 'kicked', 'school', 'had', 'move', 'here', 'Sunnydale', 'butt-end', 'nowhere', 'course', 'vampires', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'desires', 'school', 'girls', 'nasty', 'vampire', 'town', 'Master', 'called', 'waiting', 'chance', 'break', 'free', 'take', 'over', 'world.Thus', 'Season', 'One', 'Buffy', 'more', 'vampires', 'Season', 'One', 'course', 'witches', 'Incan', 'mummy', 'girls', 'giant', 'praying', 'mantis', 'ladies', 'living', 'nightmares', 'invisible', 'girls', 'etc', 'ways', 'bit', 'uneven', 'heroes', 'find', 'way', 'roles', 'other', 'ways', 'best', 'season', 'so', 'new', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'Cordelia', 'develop', 'one-dimensional', 'Queen', 'B', 'multi-faceted', 'member', 'group', 'somewhat', 'reluctant', 'member', 'group', 'box', 'set', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'many', 'bells', 'whistles', 'newer', 'ones', 'are', 'nice', 'commentaries', 'episodes', 'Unfortunately', 'once', 'turn', 'commentary', 'one', 'episode', 'entire', 'disk', 'turn', 'off', 'DVD', 'player', 'remove', 'DVD', 'put', 'something', 'else', 'awhile', 'then', 'put', 'back', 'bit', 'annoying', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'would', 'turn', 'commentaries', 'back', 'as', 'well', 'Something', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'seasons', 'more', 'outtakes', 'Everyone', 'outtakes', 'only', 'one', 'seasons', 'outtake', 'reels', 'believe', 'Season', '4', 'disks', 'might', 'be', 'mistaken', 'more', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'eye', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss']",N/A

564111,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005221I,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","Having had a couple of years to mull over the final episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and how it fulfilled Joss Whedon's mission statement for the series, I have been reconsidering the show's first season in terms of how it set the foundation for everything that was to come.  If you have seen the original theatrical movie version of ""BtVS,"" then you have probably noticed how the words are clearly Whedon's, but the tone is not.  Given a rare opportunity for a second chance to realize his vision, the first season establishes the following points for contemplation.  You will note that they are based more on comparisons to the theatrical film than the series finale, because that ended up being the more pertinent analog:(1) The most important factor that gives the television series more depth than the movie is clearly the character of Angel (David Boreanaz), although the creation of the Scooby Gang is huge as well. But even more impressive than the fact that a vampire with a soul is in love with the Slayer is the fact that Joss Whedon holds off on this revelation until the seventh episode (""Angel""). For the first six episodes Angel was Mystery Guy, Stealth Guy, Cryptic Guy, and then in the first truly memorable moment of the series, Buffy learns the truth as Angel's face morphs in her bedroom. Creating these star-crossed lovers is where this television series start an operatic story arc that culminates in ""Becoming: Part II,"" the show's zenith.(2) Related to this is the Master (Mark Metcalf) story arc that defines the first season. Each subsequent season of Buffy has similarly been defined by a pair of story arcs, usually dividing the season in half: Season 2 starts with Spike & Dru and then Angelus takes over in the second half. Of course, this helps set up the thrilling season finales each year as the Master/Angelus/Mayor/Adam/Glory meets their fate. But it also means that throughout the season things are brewing and building. In other words, the order of the episodes matters.(3) As Joss Whedon has often told us, the subtext of ""BtVS"" is that High School is Hell. I was surprised that over half the episodes from the First Season dealt primarily with the horrors of going to high school, as opposed to expanding the Buffy mythos. Living up to the unreasonable expectations of parents (""Witch""), having a crush on a teacher (""Teacher's Pet""), school cliques (""The Pack""), meeting someone on the internet (""I Robot, You Jane""), facing your worst fears (""Nightmares""), being ignored by everybody (""Out of Mind, Out of Sight""), and even just trying to go out on a date (""Never Kill a Boy On the First Date"") are dealt with in Season One.(4) The final obvious strength of the show would be the characters and the actors playing them. Willow (Allyson Hannigan) might by the all-time best Best Friend, and watching the character grow over the years has been fascinating. Poking fun at the pomposity of Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) never grows old, but I have to admit that I think Xander (Nicholas Brendon) is the [punch line] of way too many jokes. Then again, one of the show's masterstrokes is that Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), who represents everything about high school that the others hate, gets dragged into being a member of the gang. It is also clear in retrospect that Joss Whedon's knows how to use the characters and acting talent he stumbles across. Elizabeth Anne Allen (Amy Madison), Robia LaMorte (Jenny Calendar), and Mercedes McNab (Harmony) are all introduced in first season episodes and brought back for even greater fun in future episodes.Watching the first season episodes of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" makes it clear that the show certainly started strong. Yes, there are some efforts that could be a lot better: my groaner is ""Teacher's Pet"" although others have problems with ""Witch,"" ""I Robot, You Jane"" and ""Out of Mind, Out of Sight."" But all of those episodes suffer in part because they are the farthest removed from the core of the Buffy mythos. But the ""Welcome to the Hellmouth/The Harvest"" pilot, ""The Pack,"" ""Angel"" and ""Prophecy Girl"" are first-rate efforts, and that's a third of the initial season right there. However, as soon as you watch ""When She Was Bad,"" the first episode from Season Two, it is clear that the show had gotten a LOT better.

564112,A1W0ODR0SK9H4R,B00005221I,LeftManOut,"[2, 2]","There are not many television shows that have garnered my interest the way Buffy The Vampire Slayer did. Having seen Joss Whedon's initial film ""Buffy The Vampire"", I didn't know what to expect from the series when it came along. However after the first episode of the season, I'm sure you will be hooked as well. While season 1 of the show might not be its deepest strongest effort, it definitely shows how much potential the show initially had, and how amazing it would become in later seasons (particularly 2 and 3). Although much of the season focuses around the Buffy's life in high school after moving to Sunnydale, none of the episodes lack the strength of any that would come later. Buffy fans need take heed and pick this up immediately.Most of the major characters and themes in the story are set in the first season. The introduction of characters like Angel, Willow, Xander, Giles, Buffy and Cordelia all give hints to what will come in later seasons (especially in the case of the romance between Buffy and Angel). It has been said before that a lot of the Buffy mythos was not explained in the initial season, and that most of the story focuses around the life of a high school student who must balance her time between her slaying duties and the pressures of everyday teenage life. This is entirely true. While the story does focus more on high school, that does not detract from the plot a bit. In fact after watching seminal episodes like ""Welcome To The Hellmouth"" or ""Prophecy Girl"", it would be hard to write this off as just another teenage drama. The horror element adds amazing depth to the story. Whedon did a masterful job incorporating two completely opposite worlds with ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" (the horror one, and the teenage drama one). Things which happened in the first season were continued up until the very last episode, so in essence season one sets the foundation for the amazing things that would follow. The acting is altogether amazing, and the cast, while somewhat small and overlooked, does a stellar job with their parts. Sarah Michelle Gellar gives perfect life to the series' heroine as she displays the odd quirkiness and disposition of Buffy. Willow (Allison Hannigan) and Xander (Nicolas Brendan) are the perfect best friends to the leading lady (and each only get better as the story progresses). The only detraction is that the first season is only 12 episodes in length, making it very short. However understand that ""BtVS"" replaced a show mid season. That's the reason for its short airing. Besides that there is not one problem with the set or its episodes. The commentaries and extras such as outtakes, bloopers and more, are all welcomed additions to this already great set.It's really kind of disappointing that after 7 seasons Buffy was finally ended. What's more disappointing is that stellar shows like Angel and Roswell both met similar fates. If you never got into ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" while it was playing on tv, but you maybe had interest in the movie, or in horror or drama, then this is the series for you. I would also recommend Buffy's counterpart series ""Angel"", and Jason Katim's ""Roswell"" as well. No matter when you started watching Buffy, season one is essential viewing for all fans. This is a great DVD set from one of the greatest television shows to ever be aired, and unfortunately we will not be getting anymore fragments of the story.

The problem with being an intellectual snob is that one only discovers television shows by accident, which means you've always missed a good deal of history.  So, despite an occasional rerun, I pretty much lost the entire first season.  To make matters worse, I've only recently acquired the ability to watch DVD's.  I am pleased to announce that my woes are now over.  With the release of the first season on DVD and the up and coming release of the second season, I am about to enter Buffy heaven.Watching these episodes I was struck by the talented writing and acting that were present right from the beginning.  It is immediately apparent that the show was never intended to be yet another scary film take-off.  From Sarah Gellar to Anthony Head the actors display an almost effortless professionalism.  And the writing is filled with the kind of bright dialog and wit to which us adults can only aspire.This set contains the first 12 episodes which are all there was of the first season.  Officially, that's from ''Welcome to the Hellmouth' to 'Prophecy Girl'.  It's hard to pick one out as a favorite, but I'm currently very fond of 'Teacher's Pet' in which Xander's woes remind me of much of my own early history.  All are wonderful, and I no longer think of myself as one of the BTVS disadvantaged.In addition to the episodes themselves, there are interviews with Joss Whedon and David Boreanaz, a full length commentary on 'Welcome to the Hellmouth' by Whedon, who also provides several interviews.  Television trailers, photo stills, and the original pilot script are there as well.  Languages alternatives are English and French (also available in surround sound).

It set up the rest of the series brilliantly, and contains some of its best episodes. This was before things got very out of hand--the episodes here and light, fluffy and fun. The pilot was clever, bringing to it the feel of the film version, yet giving it a more sinister and deadly tone, darkening up things just a bit while keeping the whole ""Valley Girl"" feel. Characters are introduced who we think we'll never see again, but who cleverly show up in later seasons.The show is witty and very well-written and developed. It's amazing how well thought out it all is. All the episodes here are stand-outs, playing like mini horror films, mixing teen angst, comedy, and horror flawlessly.

Season 1 is a start, but comes no where near the quality of the second season on.The great thing about the first season of Buffy is that its a season of its own. No huge cliff hangers or anything. The season begins and ends like a movie, with a solid beginning and a solid ending.The tv show picks up where the movie left off. Buffy moves to Sunnydale after the insident that occured in her last home town (Refer the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Movie). There, she meets her new watcher Giles and becomes friends with two loaners Willow and Xander. Together the three fight Vampires, witches, and demones.This season is also the introduction of the vampire Angel whom warns Buffy of impending danger. This makes Buffy's first season essential for any fan of the show ""Angel.""The Villian for the season is a freaky looking vampire known as The Master. I still have nightmares about the guy! He has plans to take over the world and of course Buffy can't let that happen.The season has a lot of what I would call ""Stupid"" villians. Which is the reason I think the first season drags a bit, although some of the episodes are essential to the telling of the Buffy Story, I think that they could have been done in about six episodes.All in all season 1 is a must have for any Buffy/Angel fan, but just don't expect something fantastic....Now season 2 will blow your socks off!!!!",3,"Not the best season, but off to a good start!",1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,1530,"['reason', 'low', 'rating', 'first', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'be', 'honest', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'caliber', 'other', 'Buffy', 'Seasons', 'Season', '1', 'start', 'where', 'quality', 'second', 'season', 'on.The', 'great', 'thing', 'first', 'season', 'Buffy', 'season', 'own', 'huge', 'cliff', 'hangers', 'anything', 'season', 'movie', 'solid', 'beginning', 'solid', 'ending.The', 'tv', 'show', 'up', 'where', 'movie', 'left', 'off', 'Buffy', 'Sunnydale', 'insident', 'occured', 'last', 'home', 'town', 'Refer', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Movie', 'new', 'watcher', 'Giles', 'friends', 'two', 'loaners', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'Together', 'three', 'fight', 'Vampires', 'witches', 'demones.This', 'season', 'also', 'introduction', 'vampire', 'Angel', 'whom', 'Buffy', 'impending', 'danger', 'Buffy', 'first', 'season', 'essential', 'fan', 'show', 'Angel', 'Villian', 'season', 'freaky', 'looking', 'vampire', 'known', 'Master', 'still', 'have', 'nightmares', 'guy', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'course', 'Buffy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'happen.The', 'season', 'lot', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'Stupid', 'villians', 'Which', 'reason', 'think', 'first', 'season', 'bit', 'episodes', 'are', 'essential', 'telling', 'Buffy', 'Story', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'about', 'six', 'episodes.All', 'season', '1', 'must', 'have', 'Buffy/Angel', 'fan', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'something', 'fantastic', '.Now', 'season', '2', 'will', 'blow', 'socks', 'off']",N/A

The only reason I bought it was because of the low price, boredom, and wanting something to watch on an upcoming road trip with family.

But as time wore on I became HOOKED like a crack addict.I started to love every single one of these characters. Angel. Giles. Buffy. Willow. Xander. Buffy's mom. The Master even (ha). Etc.The last two episodes of this season are killer. I especially love the moment when Buffy is walking to fight the Master in her white dress while music is playing.

For anyone who hasn't been able to watch all the early shows, this is your chance to find them back-to-back and uninterrupted. There aren't a lot of extras on these DVDs (and thus the reasonable price), but Whedon's commentary and the cast interviews are very interesting. I have enjoyed watching these early shows and seeing these young characters mature and develop so much. It's amazing to see the earliest parts of the BTVS mythology; it's even more amazing that this show is true to its own myths, and Whedon weaves this element into all the shows. This isn't just a show for teens--trust me, I'm a 30-something who watches the show religiously. If you are brand new to Buffy, for goodness' sake, tune in and watch the show.

564130,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B00005221I,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[3, 4]","When you break it down, all it took to make Buffy was great writing and great casting.That is, of course, like saying all it took to make the Sistine Chapel was paint and a ladder.How good is Buffy? So good it's scary. Or should be, to the witless clods who produce most television shows. Unless Joss Wheedon made a deal with a real demon (maybe not such a farfetched idea) he had no more and no less to work with when he started than anyone else. His show is just another television show, after all. No different, really, than, say, ""The Greatest American Hero"" or, for that matter, ""Charmed."" It's all just silly entertainment, right?Ladies and gentlemen, to quote Stephen King (and who is more appropriate to quote here): ""You can drink your Dom Perignom from Waterford crystal or a Flintsones jelly glass, but folks, there IS a difference.""Here is the difference. Buffy is not just entertainment, of either the guilty pleasure or the ""good-bad"" variety. It is great storytelling, told by great actors with terrific chemistry, backed up by people who believe in the show. It is television for people who hate television. It is horror/fantasy for people who hate horror and fantasy. It is just plain good (insert your favorite expletive).What gets me when I watch the first season on DVD is that A) this show was a mid-season replacement (!) and B) that it was predicated on the largely forgettable movie of the same name, which came out in '95, two years before the TV show's debut. That's the creative equivalent of being picked 27th in the NFL draft and then turning into Joe Montana.The DVD is of course ""light"" due to the fact it is only half a season (12 episodes) long, but who gives a damn? When every bullet in your gun is a magnum, you don't exactly need a thosuand rounds, do you?Another striking feature is how quickly the actors took control of their characters and made them into people. For example, it took Anthony Stewart Head less than 3 episodes to have the ultra-complex Giles nailed down. That is incredible when you consider that many actors don't get a real feel for their characters in the first year or even two years of their shows (Patrick Stewart didn't have Capt. Picard down cold until the beginning of ""Trek's"" third season). It would have been so easy for Head to become a stodgy Van Helsing self-parody, or, in the words of Ethan Rayne, ""the snivelling, tweed-clad guardian of the Slayer"" (or in still other words, a Wesley Wyndham-Price character), but Head added layers to Giles almost immediately, and never stopped adding them. But to single out Head's skills is unfair, because the whole cast rocks. The actors are so good that just when you have decided on a favorite, somebody else steps to the plate and bam, it's a whole different home run race. Suffice to say good acting is one thing, good writing is another, but you can't buy this kind of chemistry.My personal picks from the inaugural season (excluding the two part opener):""Witch"": this episode is notable because it establishes right off the bat that Buffy doesn't just stake vamps, and shows how quickly the independent characters became the Scoobie Gang. If you watch this episode as a stand-alone, you will be struck by how smooth the interplay is between Giles, Xander, Willow, Cordelia, and Buffy. It has the feel of a troupe that's been working together for years. It is the third episode of the first season.""Teacher's Pet"": Buffy's ability to self-parody using humor allows the writers to create the most ridiculous plots imaginable and still make them work. Plus Mrs. French is pretty hot. Who cares that she's really a giant shape-shifting praying mantis who eats teenage virgins? Great work by Nicholas Brendon.""Never Kill a Boy...."" One of the things that makes BVS work so well is the fact that despite being a super-powered babe, Buffy is still stuck with the same problems as every other teenager: love triangles, homework, boy troubles, fights with Mom. In this outing she discovers that Slaying is one lonely gig. This is also a real showcase for the dude who plays the Master, who I'm convinced is the same guy who played Lt. Neidermeyer in ""Animal House."" (if I'm right about this, somebody please drop me a note)""I Robot, You Jane"" Willow gets to flex against the demon Moloch, who unfortunately gets really, really dead at the end of the episode. Unfortunate because he was a great baddie (""Right now a man in China is transferring funds to an account in Hong Kong to have his mother killed (long pause) Good for him."")""The Pack"" A tour de force for Nick Brendon, who plays a nastily self-confident villain so well you almost forget how bumbling and innefectual the normal Xander is. Probably his turn here got him more villain work in Season Three's ""Doppelgangland.""""The Puppet Show"" Who doesn't find those damn dolls creepy? This one introduces the great principal Snider, who replaced hyena bait principal Flutie, and utters an all-time great Buffyism: ""Being friends with your students....that's the sort of woolly-headed liberal thinking that leads to being eaten."" It also has the funniest scene ever, when the Scoobies make a [weak] attempt to perform a stage version of ""Oedipus.""It's worth noting that there are actually no bad episodes in the season, just some that stand out more than others (call it 12 - 0 with six or seven knockouts). Most everything is laid down that needs to be, including the show's basic mythology and the relationships between the characters (Xander's crush on Buffy, Willow's crush on Xander, Buffy's crush on Angel) that are so important to everything that follows later. What's truly amazing is that as good as all of this is, Spike and Drusilla haven't shown up yet, Angel hasn't gone bad, and Faith and the Mayor are way, way off. In other words, the best is still yet to come.

564138,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00005221I,Mitch Weaver,"[1, 2]","The first season establishes that Buffy Summers ( Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a vampire slayer and that she must protect Sunnydale due to the fact that it is on what is refered to as a Hellmouth. The school librarian Rupert Giles ( Anthony Stewart Head) is introduced as Buffy's watcher who guides and trains her for her upcoming battles with the evil of Sunnydale. Buffy becomes friends with Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendan)and Willow Rosenburg ( Alyson Hannigan)who quickly learn of Buffy's situation, and decide to help save the lives of those in Sunnydale by working along side Buffy and Giles. Buffy also meets and begins to fall for a vampire with a soul named Angel (David Boreanaz)who also helps Buffy out from time to time. The main conflict of season one, is Buffy and her friends preparing to fight the master vampire of Sunnydale, who plans on releasing hell on earth by opening up the Hellmouth.When I first heard about Buffy the Vampire Slayer being turned into a weekly television show, I was as skeptical as everyone else. However, you could tell that the show was going to become a good one after the very first episode. Show creator Joss Whedon managed to cast each character perfectly, and also managed to provide excellent dialogue for the characters, great special effects, and tons of action, suspense, and humor. Even though the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is probably the weakest one, you can't really hold anything against the first season either because there was only 12 episodes. You have to look at the first season as more of a stepping stone that leads to something great. The best episodes from the first season are  &quot;Welcome to the Hellmouth&quot;, &quot;The Harvest&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Nightmares&quot;, and &quot;Prophecy Girl&quot;.Overall, the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer offers a very decent start to the show, as well as some quality episodes.

564140,ADFLBRY00Y70G,B00005221I,M. Lohrke,"[3, 4]","buffy the vampire slayer is sacred territory for a lot of people, and consequently a lot of reviews on amazon.com are pretty biased and myopic.  i'm not a buffy disciple, nor purist, nor anything of the sort.  i'd never seen a single episode of buffy the vampire the slayer until about two weeks ago.  so my review doesn't suffer from 10 years of buffy-worshipping.  i'm just a regular guy who started watching buffy without any preconceived notions or ideas.what 'buffy' does so well, and what makes it so successful in my opinion, is that establishes a buffy mythology. a lot of the most successful series in recent years (x-files, veronica mars, lost, 24, among others) do a great job at establishing a particular mythology.  it's not enough to simply create interesting characters anymore.  joss whedon and crew succeed in creating an entirely new world.  despite it's sort of absurd premise, this is what makes buffy successful.the series does seem to struggle in finding its footing in the beginning.  the dialogue, acting, and direction are sometimes clumsy, but that's to be expected given that it was the first season.  during the first few episodes sarah michelle gellar seems to have a bit of struggle adjusting to her character, but come the last two episodes she managed to turn buffy into a fully-realized character.  the last episode, 'prophecy girl,' is especially poignant and heart-felt and gellar really shines in showing both the vulnerable buffy and the courageous buffy.  it's the kind of perfomance that makes buffy wholly believable.  and it's a good thing given that the success of the show rested squarely on her shoulders.the supporting cast provides some nice moments as well.  willow and xander are great sidekicks as the geeky brain and sex-crazed adolescent male, respectively. giles, buffy's english 'watcher' gives the trio much needed guidance and provides occassional levity.  cordelia is at times a bit over the top most of the time, but thankfully we get to see a little bit more of her vulnerable side as the series progresses. the hunky angel, though someone underused in my opinion, provides some nice dramatic tension.  and i get the feeling that joss whedon had some serious crushes on his high school teachers as most of the teachers in buffy are ridiculously hot.surprisingly enough, i think buffy is most enjoyable when we see little or none of the vampires.  when the episodes explore teenage angst, isolation, jealousy, love, rejection, and triumph is when 'buffy the vampire slayer' really succeeds and is the most enjoyable.  this is a credit to whedon's keen eye and observational skills.sure, sometimes you'll *really* have to suspend disbelief and sit through some silly plots, but you'd be hard pressed to find a more geniunely enjoyable television show. i'm looking to spending some more time in sunnyvale, ca with buffy and her crew.  and did i mention sarah michelle gellar is extremely attractive?p.s. the dvd 'extras' are marginal, at best.  it's too bad. i would have liked a lot more interviews and behind-the-scenes stuff. hopefully the rest of the seasons will have more extras.",4,not a review by a buffy disciple,1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,3140,"['vampire', 'slayer', 'sacred', 'territory', 'lot', 'people', 'consequently', 'lot', 'reviews', 'amazon.com', 'are',

564144,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00005221I,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[6, 6]","When 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' was first launched it's pretty certain to say that there were a few people out there that scoffed at its name and dismissed it as a stupid teen fantasy.  But when you watch this first series you see just how fresh and original this series is.  In it there's the feisty yet vulnerable Buffy Summers who fights both her emotional and more literal demons.  She's joined by best friends Willow and Xander, the very bottom of the school's social spectrum.  Along for the ride is spoilt popular Cordelia and the dark and mysterious Angel.The first series is a great deal lighter than the later series (particularly the dark Series Five), with a more gothic feel to it - such as the clan of vampires that live in a cave under Sunnydale.  It's nice to see a show that deals with teenage life with such a mature approach without patronising its audience.  Also original is the fact that our heroine and her friends are the least popular people in school.  Plus it's strange to see all those old faces again, with their characters having changed so dramatically (but also realistically), especially a shy Willow whose clothes were picked out by her mom.  Also interesting is the introduction of characters originally intended for merely one episode that were eventually to be integrated fully into the show, such as Angel, Darla and Harmony.But whilst always delivering a witty quip or a hilarious situation, there's the upsetting and traumatising events of adolescense displayed on our screen.  Particularly heart-rending is Buffy's discovery that she is prophecised to die in the final episode of Season One, 'Prophecy Girl'.  By exaggerating such traumas, the show has managed to bring to the forefront how each small knock can have much larger consequences when young, how everything seems worse than it really is.  Take, 'Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight', in which one girl that is unnoticed by her supposed friends turns invisible.This is a winning TV series that not only satisfies its younger audience but is also aimed at adults.  People who scoff at fantasy programmes purely for their genre look out, 'Buffy' has proved that it is here to stay.  Indeed, this was only the beginning of an increasingly innovative show that was to garner critic and audience support.",5,Winning drama...for adults!,1009065600,"12 23, 2001",2001,2291,"['When', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'was', 'first', 'launched', 'pretty', 'certain', 'say', 'were', 'few', 'people', 'there', 'scoffed', 'name', 'dismissed', 'stupid', 'teen', 'fantasy', 'when', 'watch', 'first', 'series', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'fresh', 'original', 'series', 'feisty', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'who', 'fights', 'emotional', 'more', 'literal', 'demons', 'joined', 'best', 'friends', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'very', 'bottom', 'school', 'social', 'spectrum', 'ride', 'spoilt', 'popular', 'Cordelia', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'Angel.The', 'first', 'series', 'great', 'deal', 'lighter', 'later', 'series', 'particularly', 'dark', 'Series', 'Five', 'more', 'gothic', 'feel', 'such', 'clan', 'vampires', 'live', 'cave', 'Sunnydale', 'nice', 'see', 'show', 'deals', 'teenage', 'life', 'mature', 'approach', 'patronising', 'audience', 'Also', 'original', 'fact', 'heroine', 'friends', 'are', 'least', 'popular', 'people', 'school', 'strange', 'see', 'old', 'again', 'characters', 'having', 'changed', 'so', 'dramatically', 'also', 'realistically', 'especially', 'shy', 'Willow', 'clothes', 'were', 'picked', 'out', 'mom', 'Also', 'interesting', 'introduction', 'characters', 'originally', 'intended', 'merely', 'one', 'episode', 'were', 'eventually', 'be', 'integrated', 'fully', 'show', 'such', 'Angel', 'Darla', 'Harmony.But', 'whilst', 'always', 'delivering', 'witty', 'quip', 'hilarious', 'situation', 'upsetting', 'traumatising', 'events', 'adolescense', 'displayed', 'screen', 'Particularly', 'heart-rending', 'Buffy', 'discovery', 'prophecised', 'die', 'final', 'episode', 'Season', 'One', 'Girl', 'exaggerating', 'such', 'traumas', 'show', 'managed', 'bring', 'forefront', 'how', 'small', 'knock', 'can', 'have', 'much', 'larger', 'consequences', 'when', 'young', 'how', 'everything', 'worse', 'really', 'Take', ""'Out"", 'Mind', 'Out', 'Sight', 'one', 'girl', 'unnoticed', 'supposed', 'friends', 'invisible.This', 'winning', 'TV', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'younger', 'audience', 'also', 'aimed', 'adults', 'People', 'who', 'scoff', 'fantasy', 'programmes', 'purely', 'genre', 'look', 'proved', 'here', 'stay', 'Indeed', 'was', 'only', 'beginning', 'increasingly', 'innovative', 'show', 'was', 'garner', 'critic', 'audience', 'support']",N/A
564145,A1BBT9XLKQDV81,B00005221I,"N8 ""Buffy is Queen!!""","[0, 0]","As with many other fans and reviewers, I was skeptical of a show based off of the wacky Buffy movie starring nonother than the girl who played Kendall (the chagrined daughter of Erica's rape) on All My Children.  Lucky for me, my skepticism lasted only through the opening credits of the first episode.  Instantly the audience, the network, and the creative team were able to tell they had struck gold with what would become arguably the greatest television show in TV history.Joss Whedon's creativity, writing and (later on) directing skills all meshed together with an impecable cast that charmed the audience with their first lines.  The use of Buffy as a strong but understandably confused adolescent girl whose ""destiny"" is to slay vampires and thereby protect humankind is amazingly well done by Sarah and her writers.  Xander's goofballishness is charming enough to make you want to be his friend, but understandably annoying enough to make him unpopular at school.  Willow is the biggest nerd of all nerds who obviously needs a friends, and the scooby gang comes to fulfill that role perfectly.  Even the annoyingness of early Giles is great in this season.Season 1 of Buffy is often the basis by which all other seasons are judged.  Not because it is necessarily the best, but because it does such a great job of allowing us to fall in love with the characters and feel like we are there with them.  The Master storyline was weak at times and utterly bone chilling at its best, but one thing is certain: by defeating the Master, Buffy proved herself to her water, her friends, and all her fans.

Since the time the show first primiered, I dismissed it as another WB teeniebopper mellow drama with vampires thrown into the mix.  Season one is pretty much that in a nut shell, but despite the fact that the first season relies on way too much teen mellowdrama and some sloppy storytelling, the show has a strangely addicting quality to it thanks to the fine cast and quirky humor.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is Buffy Summers, a vampire slayer who moves from L.A. to Sunnydale, California (the show basically picks up from where the film, which starred Kirsty Swanson as Buffy, left off), a town full of vampires, demons, and all kinds of other nasties.  She soon meets her would be mentor Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), popular airhead Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), and finds friends in the dorky Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and computer whiz Willow (Alyson Hannigan); both of whom would be the only cast members, along with Gellar, that would remain as full time cast members until the end of the series.  Buffy also encounters the mysterious Angel (David Boreanaz) who plays quite a pivotal role in episodes to come.  There is plenty to admire about the series, but some of the episodes, particularly the season finale, come off as pretty weak.  All that aside though, this first season of Buffy is better than what I thought it would be, but the best of Buffy would not be seen until later on in the series' life.",3,Definitely not the best season,1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,1485,"['did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'last', 'few', 'seasons', 'time', 'show', 'first', 'primiered', 'dismissed', 'WB', 'teeniebopper', 'mellow', 'drama', 'vampires', 'thrown', 'mix', 'Season', 'one', 'pretty', 'much', 'nut', 'shell', 'fact', 'first', 'season', 'relies', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'teen', 'mellowdrama', 'sloppy', 'storytelling', 'show', 'strangely', 'addicting', 'quality', 'fine', 'cast', 'quirky', 'humor', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'who', 'L.A.', 'Sunnydale', 'California', 'show', 'basically', 'up', 'where', 'film', 'starred', 'Kirsty', 'Swanson', 'Buffy', 'left', 'off', 'town', 'full', 'vampires', 'demons', 'kinds', 'other', 'nasties', 'soon', 'would', 'be', 'mentor', 'Giles', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'popular', 'airhead', 'Cordelia', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'friends', 'dorky', 'Xander', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'computer', 'whiz', 'Willow', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'whom', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'cast', 'members', 'Gellar', 'would', 'remain', 'full', 'time', 'cast', 'members', 'end', 'series', 'Buffy', 'also', 'mysterious', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'who', 'quite', 'pivotal', 'role', 'episodes', 'come', 'plenty', 'admire', 'series', 'episodes', 'particularly', 'season', 'finale', 'come', 'off', 'pretty', 'weak', 'aside', 'first', 'season', 'Buffy', 'better', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'Buffy', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'later', 'series', 'life']",N/A

I was in high school at the time, so I could really relate.  It's interesting in retrospect, since the series ended, observing how the show and characters evolved over time.  The first season, for the most part, is arguable lighter and a bit cheesy compared to later on, and the series didn't really hit its mark until the second season, with the introduction of darker themes, backstory and the villainous vampire duo Spike and Druscilla (James Marsters and Juliet Landau).  At first, it's all about high school junior Buffy Summers (Gellar), having moved from LA after being deemed a troublemaker at her former school, trying to adjust to life in Sunnydale, which she later learns is positioned on the Hellmouth, where vampires, demons and other ghastly stuff roams.  She discovers that she is ""the chosen one"" -  the slayer who must work to rid the world of evil.  Her watcher, school librarian Rupert Giles (Anthony Steward Head), aids her in her burdening responsibility, while her two closest friends, geeky but lovable Xander (Nicholas Brendon), and shy computer nerd Willow (Alyson Hannigan), find out about Buffy's destiny and join the team.  Eventually, the snobby and ultra-popular Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) also finds her way into what would later be referred to as the Scooby gang.  As if the burden of being the Slayer isn't enough, Buffy also has to deal with the trials and tribulations of teenage life (her beauty, wardrobe and wit don't make her popular, her grades aren't always stellar and the school authorities sometimes view her as a troublemaker), all the while trying to keep her destiny and mission a secret, and dealing with the aftermath of her parents' divorce, living with her single mother (Kristine Sutherland).  Oh, and there's the mysterious, handsome Angel (David Boreanaz, for the next two seasons would be a series regular, before departing to his own spin-off, taking Cordelia with him), who gives her information regarding resident evils, and whom she falls for.She discovers a secret about him (he's a vampire with a soul) that makes for a star-crossed love that will carry on for two more installments and resurface briefly in later seasons. The slayer can't seem to achieve an ordinary life or romance, which continues to be proven as she falls into another ill-fated romance with the now-reformed Spike in the last two seasons.The best episodes of this first installment are ""Welcome To The Hellmouth"", ""Angel"", ""Nightmares"", ""Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight"" and ""Prophecy Girl"".  There are only 12 episodes, a glaring difference from the other seasons, which consist of 10 more, but gives you all more time to indulge in season 2.Prepare yourself for teen-angst, Buffy style!",4,Buffy: The Beginning,1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,3017,"['Maybe', 'not', 'techincally', 'beginning', 'was', '1992', 'feature', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'starring', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'series', 'was', 'huge', 'improvement', 'movie', 'Emmy-winner', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'lead', 'show', 'really', 'caught', 'attention', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'time', 'could', 'really', 'relate', 'interesting', 'retrospect', 'series', 'ended', 'observing', 'how', 'show', 'characters', 'evolved', 'time', 'first', 'season', 'most', 'part', 'arguable', 'lighter', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'compared', 'later', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'hit', 'mark', 'second', 'season', 'introduction', 'darker', 'themes', 'backstory', 'villainous', 'vampire', 'duo', 'Spike', 'Druscilla', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Juliet', 'Landau', 'first', 'about', 'high', 'school', 'junior', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'Gellar', 'having', 'moved', 'LA', 'being', 'deemed', 'troublemaker', 'former', 'school', 'trying', 'adjust', 'life', 'Sunnydale', 'later', 'positioned', 'Hellmouth', 'where', 'vampires', 'demons', 'other', 'ghastly', 'stuff', 'roams', 'chosen', 'one', 'slayer', 'who', 'must', 'work', 'rid', 'world', 'evil', 'watcher', 'school', 'librarian', 'Rupert', 'Giles', 'Anthony', 'Steward', 'Head', 'burdening', 'responsibility', 'two', 'closest', 'friends', 'geeky', 'lovable', 'Xander', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'shy', 'computer', 'nerd', 'Willow', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'find', 'out', 'Buffy', 'destiny', 'join', 'team', 'Eventually', 'snobby', 'ultra-popular', 'Cordelia', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'also', 'way', 'what', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'referred', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'burden', 'being', 'Slayer', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Buffy', 'also', 'deal', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'teenage', 'life', 'beauty', 'wardrobe', 'wit', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'popular', 'grades', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'stellar', 'school', 'authorities', 'sometimes', 'view', 'troublemaker', 'while', 'trying', 'keep', 'destiny', 'mission', 'secret', 'dealing', 'aftermath', 'parents', 'divorce', 'living', 'single', 'mother', 'Kristine', 'Sutherland', 'Oh', 'mysterious', 'handsome', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'would', 'be', 'series', 'regular', 'departing', 'own', 'spin-off', 'taking', 'Cordelia', 'who', 'information', 'regarding', 'resident', 'evils', 'whom', 'for.She', 'discovers', 'secret', 'vampire', 'soul', 'star-crossed', 'love', 'will', 'carry', 'two', 'more', 'installments', 'resurface', 'briefly', 'later', 'seasons', 'slayer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'achieve', 'ordinary', 'life', 'romance', 'be', 'proven', 'ill-fated', 'romance', 'now-reformed', 'Spike', 'last', 'two', 'seasons.The', 'best', 'episodes', 'first', 'installment', 'are', 'Welcome', 'Hellmouth', 'Angel', 'Nightmares', 'Mind', 'Out', 'Sight', 'Prophecy', 'Girl', 'are', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'glaring', 'difference', 'other', 'seasons', 'consist', '10', 'more', 'more', 'time', 'indulge', 'season', '2.Prepare', 'teen-angst', 'Buffy', 'style']",N/A

But despite the fact season one only consists of twelve episodes, they pack as much power as any debut season of any show on television.  Throughout the first season, we are introduced to all the major players in addition to Buffy including Xander, Willow, Giles and Angel.  Angel starts off as a minor character, but as the season progresses he and Buffy become more involved and his role elevates.  Season one continuing plot revolves around The Master who is the supreme vampire.  He is trapped in the Hellmouth and throughout the season chronicles his attempt to be freed.  Even though the main focus is on fighting vampires, other demons arise.  One particularly strong episode is where Xander and several other students are possessed with the spirits of hyenas.

And when BUFFY, THE VAMPIRE SLAYER: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON comes out, it will be a great DVD to jump-start my collection. I really love the TV show, but I've always thought season #1 was the best season the show had, and it's not just because season #1 had all the original characters, but also because season #1 is a TV classic! My favorite show is actually &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, but I love &quot;Buffy&quot; almost as much!Anyway, I am so excited about this DVD set. For those who've never seen &quot;Buffy&quot; and don't know what the show is about, well...it's about this teen girl named Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who moves to a town called Sunnydale in California, and is the Chosen One, or the one to fight off all that is evil, basically vampires. She's a vampire slayer, of course. So all throughout the show, she spends her time fighting off the evil blood-sucking vampires while trying to fit in with the rest of her high school peers. Finally! We get a female heroine on TV. &quot;Buffy&quot; is better than &quot;Xena: Warrior Princess&quot;. Buffy kicks butt! Standing beside Buffy are her two best friends Xander (Nicholas Brendan), and Willow (Alyson Hannigan).I still enjoy the new episodes of &quot;Buffy, the Vampire Slayer&quot;, except the only problem is, is that I hardly ever watch the show anymore. All the actors who've worked on this show are excellent and talented, and the scripts are amazing! The special effects are pretty cool, too. It seems as though all the actors and crew are dedicated to this show, which makes you even want to watch it more because they are so loyal and talented.From what I see here on Amazon.com for the special features, it looks pretty good.

As some had pointed out, this is due to the tight budget the initial runs of the show were done in that they didn't film in high quality film. So, you really don't get a ""remastered"" release as this was how the show was really seen during it's first season. And believe me, when I saw this way back then, I thought that was pretty weird myself. Anyways, for the parts of the dvd you do see during the daylight hours, it's all bright and crisp so they did take care in the dvd processing. The menu screen is somewhat lackluster and boring as you really have only four selectable title options initially. The extras and stuff are shown when you decided to view a story title. Even then, you are only basically treated to a few interviews and commentaries with maybe a few bios thrown in. Definitely somewhat of a ""standard basic"" options selection in today's dvd world. The DVD set is a three disc set with only ""12"" full episodes and not the 24 that's stated on the sticker since the show was run halfway thru midseason and wasn't really expected to gather such a strong collowing. I'm glad it did as Buffy, and now Angel, are full of quick wit one liners and action that it's always a joy to watch their shows. The one complaint I hear from newer viewers is that they don't get some of the in jokes and become frustrated with the show as Buffy always tends to allude to past events that current viewers might get a bit lost. Well, here's your chance to catch up as the first season is now officially on dvd, and the very, very affordable price of $... for 12 shows!!! That's a bargain if I ever saw one. And you new viewers will finally get to see Darla and Cordelia way back when before their appearance on ""Angel."" We'll also get to see the younger Xander and Willow before they grew up into the characters they are now. You'll finally get to understand all the cheerleader/witch in jokes that pops up form time to time. You'll see Buffy's mom and grow to watch her and like her and understand how fans felt after what happened last season.

Not much of a difference there, right?  ""Buffy"" had everything, thy it be comedy, action, drama, lesbians (but only in the later seasons).  This show was well-written, and at first, poorly-recieved.  Then, like a wildfire, it spread, and now ""Buffy"" is as important to TV and the tough-girl genre as is ""Charlie's Angels"".  Sarah Michelle Gellar, here, more than ever, shows the passion that lied in the ""Buffy"" series.  The first season, in my mind, is the best season of all the others.  It showed Buffy being powerful, and a normal teenager.  The later seasons (mid-5th to 7th.  Where did Dawn come from and why is Buffy taking orders from her?) got ""bubble-gummy"" and the creators started showing the fear in Buffy, having her lose more battles, and killing her more than once.  Poor thing.  But the first season was straight-forward (i.e., cryptic message, evil prophecy, Buffy slays).  That formula worked perfectly.  The first, second, and third season all capture what was superb of this series, while the fourth and beginning of the fith only lost a tiny bit of that steam.

564169,A2Q4CZVCN5APDL,B00005221I,Rick,"[5, 7]","A nice beginning for a good show.  I came in late, I saw this first season when it started rerunning on FX.  Wish I had started sooner.  Compared to later seasons, sometimes I really miss the simplicity of this first one, in both the lighter tone, and the fact that you don't have to watch every episode to know what's going on. The are five main characters, Buffy, Willow, Xander, Cordelia, and Giles. One of the best things about the first season was the love triangle.  Xander has a crush on Buffy but she will never see him as more than a friend, Willow has a crush on Xander, but he will never see her as more than a friend. It's all cute and sometimes heart wrenching.  The underduse of Cordelia is one of this first season's biggest weaknesses.  Her character is mostly shallow but she's hilarious.  In retrospect, when you compare Cordelia in this season to her final appearance in the fifth season of the Buffy spinoff Angel, she may well be the most evolved character in Whedon's universe. Two episodes of note in this season that are often overlooked; ""Witch"", which has more twists and turns in the plot that you won't believe they packed it into one episode and features great performances by guest stars Elizabeth Anne Allen and Robin Riker, and ""Out of mind, out of sight"" which features an invisible girl terrorizing the school and is the first episode that shows there is more to Cordelia than meets the eye.

When I first saw this series back in '97 or '96 when it first came on, I was very nonimpressed.  I thought the new Buffy was a little to snotty and ful of herself.  Also, I just didn't like Sarah Micehelle Gellar's portrayal.  This seemed like another cliche' of the selfless superhero.  Years later, I have finally seen the Angel series and have come to appreciate the subtle wit that went into the writing of those stories.  So I ordered the first season of Buffy and was very pleased indeed.  Maybe I just needed to grow up.  That said, these twelves episodes are pretty original television, particularly for the theme of horror and adolescence.  My favorite episode was Out of Mind, Out of Sight; like the x-files did many times, the distinction between hero and villain was blurred (at least for 3/4)for the episode.  One of the most haunting scenes I've ever seen was when Marcy began to turn invisable in the classroom and nobody even thought to notice or care.

564172,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005221I,Robert Moore,"[3, 3]","Despite a legion of fans who recognize the series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER as one of the highpoints of filmed entertainment-whether film or TV-it is amazing how many people still either haven't seen this show, or still misconceive it as a piece of fluff for teenagers.  In fact, it is one of the most amazingly intelligent cultural artifacts of the past decade, a show that has as many adult and academic fans as teens.  For those who have never experienced all that is the Buffyverse, this DVD set is an essential beginning point.  It not only contains all twelve episodes comprising the first season, the set contains numerous interviews, commentaries, and short features that should bring any neophyte up to speed on the beginning of this landmark series.We first met Buffy the Vampire Slayer in the 1992 film of the same name.  The TV series supposedly begins a few weeks after the end of the movie, with Buffy and her mother moving to the town of Sunnydale in order to start afresh after she burned down her former high school gym, which was filled with vampires.  From nearly the first episode, the incredible chemistry among the original Scooby Gang members is established as we are introduced to Buffy's new watcher Giles, and her two new Sunnydale friends Willow and Xander.  We also meet the leading snob in the school, the appalling Cordelia Chase, and, of course, the dark and mysterious Angel.  Although this first season lacks the amazing story arcs that made BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER one of the great achievements in the history of broadcast television, the show was nonetheless remarkable from the very beginning for the enormously witty and intelligent scripts, a willingness to rethink every aspect of what is possible in a television show, and the unexpected approaches to character development,From the very beginning, the characters in Buffy have stunningly familiar problems, problems that feel more realistically treated than in all other supposedly realistic TV drams.  And the degree of development and change for any character was from the beginning amazingly original.  Consider Cordelia's first words upon seeing Angel for the first time in The Bronze in ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date""-"" Ooo! Hello, salty goodness!--are especially fascinating:""  If one juxtaposes those words with all the changes Cordelia undergoes over the years both in her relationship to Angel and in her own maturity, one is tempted to state that she perhaps has undergone more change than any character in television history.  In most shows, you learn most of what there is to know about a character almost instantly, but it is the genius of Joss Whedon and the others driving the Buffyverse that Cordelia, who seemingly is the most transparent of characters, could develop the way that she later did.The central conflict in The Hellmouth Chronicles was from the first season to the seventh the internal conflicts that Buffy experiences in regard to her own slayerhood.  On the one hand, she is the Slayer, on the other, she wants a normal life filled with dates and love and friends and birthday parties and a (nonslaying) vocation and an education.  It will take seven seasons for that story to be resolved.  The great news is that anyone experiencing Buffy for the first time in these DVDs and liking them, will not believe how great the show would get in the next season.  Merely a hint at the greatness to come.",5,An absolutely essential set for any Buffy fan,1060905600,"08 15, 2003",2003,3424,"['legion', 'fans', 'who', 'recognize', 'series', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'one', 'highpoints', 'filmed', 'entertainment-whether', 'film', 'TV-it', 'amazing', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'still', 'misconceive', 'piece', 'fluff', 'teenagers', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'amazingly', 'intelligent', 'cultural', 'artifacts', 'past', 'decade', 'show', 'as', 'many', 'adult', 'academic', 'fans', 'teens', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'Buffyverse', 'DVD', 'set', 'essential', 'beginning', 'point', 'not', 'only', 'twelve', 'comprising', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'numerous', 'interviews', 'commentaries', 'short', 'features', 'should', 'bring', 'neophyte', 'up', 'speed', 'beginning', 'landmark', 'series.We', 'first', 'met', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', '1992', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'TV', 'series', 'supposedly', 'few', 'weeks', 'end', 'movie', 'Buffy', 'mother', 'moving', 'town', 'Sunnydale', 'order', 'start', 'afresh', 'burned', 'down', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'gym', 'was', 'filled', 'vampires', 'nearly', 'first', 'episode', 'incredible', 'chemistry', 'original', 'Scooby', 'Gang', 'members', 'established', 'are', 'introduced', 'Buffy', 'new', 'watcher', 'Giles', 'two', 'new', 'Sunnydale', 'friends', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'also', 'meet', 'leading', 'snob', 'school', 'appalling', 'Cordelia', 'Chase', 'course', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'Angel', 'first', 'season', 'amazing', 'story', 'arcs', 'made', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'one', 'great', 'achievements', 'history', 'broadcast', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'remarkable', 'very', 'beginning', 'enormously', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'scripts', 'willingness', 'rethink', 'aspect', 'what', 'possible', 'television', 'show', 'unexpected', 'approaches', 'character', 'development', 'very', 'beginning', 'characters', 'Buffy', 'have', 'stunningly', 'familiar', 'problems', 'problems', 'feel', 'more', 'realistically', 'treated', 'other', 'supposedly', 'realistic', 'TV', 'drams', 'degree', 'development', 'change', 'character', 'was', 'beginning', 'amazingly', 'original', 'Consider', 'Cordelia', 'first', 'words', 'seeing', 'Angel', 'first', 'time', 'Bronze', 'Never', 'Kill', 'Boy', 'First', 'Date', 'Ooo', 'Hello', 'salty', 'goodness', 'are', 'especially', 'fascinating', 'one', 'words', 'changes', 'Cordelia', 'years', 'relationship', 'Angel', 'own', 'maturity', 'one', 'tempted', 'state', 'perhaps', 'undergone', 'more', 'change', 'character', 'television', 'history', 'most', 'shows', 'learn', 'most', 'what', 'know', 'character', 'almost', 'instantly', 'genius', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'others', 'driving', 'Buffyverse', 'Cordelia', 'who', 'seemingly', 'most', 'transparent', 'characters', 'could', 'develop', 'way', 'later', 'did.The', 'central', 'conflict', 'Hellmouth', 'Chronicles', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'seventh', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'Buffy', 'regard', 'own', 'slayerhood', 'one', 'hand', 'Slayer', 'other', 'normal', 'life', 'filled', 'dates', 'love', 'friends', 'birthday', 'parties', 'nonslaying', 'vocation', 'education', 'will', 'take', 'seven', 'seasons', 'story', 'be', 'resolved', 'great', 'news', 'anyone', 'experiencing', 'Buffy', 'first', 'time', 'DVDs', 'liking', 'will', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'great', 'show', 'would', 'get', 'next', 'season', 'Merely', 'hint', 'greatness', 'come']",N/A

For any one who has never seen &quot;Buffy,&quot; it is essential as well. What better place to start than the beginning of the story? True, the show is still starting out here, so it is not yet the perfect, amazing brilliant piece of art we see every week, but it is still very, very good. It is amazing how well the characters were written, from the beginning. In some shows, it takes a few episodes or even years for the writers and actors to find the right tone for their characters. Not so with &quot;Buffy.&quot; From the very first episode, everything falls into place perfectly, and the character interaction is realistic and wonderful. It is also amazing how well the episodes hold up continuity-wise. One would expect that a show that has been on 6 years, whose writers were creating the mythology as they went along, might have stumbled here or there...but no. I was only able to find one continuity error. When Angel meets Buffy in the first episode, &quot;Welcome to the Hellmouth,&quot; he tells her that he thought she'd be taller. In a later episode, &quot;Amends,&quot; in the third season, we learn that Angel had seen Buffy from afar in L.A. the year before, so he already knew how tall she was. And that is the only slip I was able to find. In fact, the episodes from the first season are even better if you go back to them after watching the other seasons. In &quot;Nightmares,&quot; we learn that one of Buffy's biggest nightmares is being buried alive...And in &quot;Bargaining,&quot; that is exactly what happens to her. I could go on and on about the extremely complex, brilliant mythology of the show, the great writing, the amazing acting, and the excellent production values and directing. But why not do yourself a favor, stop reading this review, and order the darn thing already! You'll be glad you did.

564178,A14XSDTJ3CNOD7,B00005221I,Saki,"[2, 2]","There's a great moment toward the end of the premiere episode of Buffy. Buffy encounters the villain of the piece after two hours of struggle, and I, as an audience member, was expecting some sort of epic clash between good and evil. Rather than that Buffy chooses to remind the vampire villain of his inability to venture into the sunlight, lest he be killed. ""You forgot about one thing,"" she says to the vampire. ""Sunrise..."" She then throws a weapon at a dark, painted window and breaks it, allowing light to spill through into the vampire's face. The vampire screams in agony for a few seconds before realizing it is just an outdoor lamp making all the light, and that the sun has not yet risen. Continuing her previous sentence about the sunrise, Buffy says, ""...is in about nine hours, moron."" She then puts a stake thorugh the villain's heart and all is, at least for the moment, well.It is this willingness to play with expectations that keeps Buffy as fresh and funny as it is. The trivialization of evil through humor also gives the show its own identity amongst a great many other television shows, movies, books, and plays that use allegorical stories to make their sweeping points.More than just its uniqueness and storytelling flare, however, make Buffy as great a show as it is. It is also about people-- real people, that live down your street, or go to your school. It's about everybody, and it is very easy to identify with different elements of each of the characters. But, then again, none of the characters are static. They change and grow, shedding old ways and developing new ones. You may identify with a character one weeks and then become uncomfortable with their choices and ideas the next week. The characters are peeled like onions, and none can be properly defined without the aid of each and every episode that they have ever appeared in. Sitcom characters are uniformly sarcastic, but Buffy characters are multidimensional entities. More even than the fun and actions of the episodes, this element of the show sticks with me as a viewer. I care about Willow, and Xander, and Buffy, and Giles, and Tara (God rest her soul), and Anya, and Dawn, and Spike, and Angel.

The video is a tad dark and the special features are rather lacking but the show is just too good for any of these things to matter.

Meanwhile, the Master played by the villian from ANimal House was fantastic.  I just wish he had a longer run on the show.

Going out on a limb was creator Joss Whedon, the man who has quickly evolved to demigod status in the eyes of millions of cult fans around the world, when he revived the box-office yuppie and decided to take it in the new direction that was sorely needed. As it turns out, the limb he walked on only grew stronger until we were all forced to acknowledge he wasn't falling off anytime soon.As the lore goes, a Vampire Slayer fends off the ever-coming darkness - vampires, demons, and the like - and does so alone, without friends or family, so as not to endanger herself or others any more than they are normally. Her development is seen over by a Watcher, part of a tribe of stuffy British people who may actually ingest dictionaries and demon mythology whole so as to provide knowledge in the clinch. Season one opens on the small California town of Sunnydale, whose shiny name disguises a town so steeped in darkness that it may very literally be sitting on the mouth of hell. Buffy, looking for an escape from vampire slaying after her first Watcher died in L.A., sees Sunnydale as a clean slate - a place to start over. That is, until her new Watcher, the school librarian Rupert Giles, contacts her with portents of evil about to break loose. So what else is new?After a mutual friend is murdered and turned into a monster, high school sophomores Willow Rosenberg and Xander Harris are pulled into Buffy's strange world and find an odd place in the not-so-well-oiled machine of Slayer and Watcher. Together, with snarky comments and pop culture references aplenty, they seek to undo any evil that pops up in Sunnydale while keeping Buffy's identity as Slayer secret from everyone, including Buffy's mom, who occasionally wanders into the line of fire.So began a TV legend. Now, Fox TV-on-DVD resurrects the show on three discs with audio commentary, subtitles, and a sprinkling of mundane featurettes. It's not really the extras I enjoyed on this DVD set - it's the twelve episodes within, which I have watched so many times I now vomit snappy one-liners.

Appearing on (barely) network television only by a perfect storm of events (Joss Whedon's towering talent and love of junk culture, note-perfect casting, and a struggling netlet that considered 2.8 million viewers an acceptable audience), Buffy not only survived, but thrived (in cultish fashion).This is the incomparable first year.

It has incredible characters and great variety in the storylines which combine the best of comedy and tragedy.The first season is a great introduction to Buffy, but it's not that good of a TV season.  The characters are dead on from the very beginning: the core actors do a fantastic job here, and Buffy, Willow, Xander and Giles are already delivering great lines.  On the other hand, the monster plots tend to be dumb, and the season's main villain is my least favorite of the entire 7 year run (The Master is very plain compared to the interesting bad guys they will face later).I blame the crappiness of these monster plots on the fact that most of the Buffy writing staff joins the show in seasons 2 and 3.  The dialog is great because it's rewritten by creator Joss Whedon, but even he can't save the ridiculousness of ""I Robot, She Jane""'s take on the internet, for instance.Still, even ""I Robot"", the worst episode here, introduces one of the best supporting characters, Giles' love interest Jenny Calendar.  Each of these  episodes has a purpose, and Buffy is best watched in order.  It's also more fun to watch the show improve in quality over the first two seasons than to watch the best episodes first and have to put up with the worse ones later.  The question is, will newcomers be turned off by the dumber aspects of season one and not finish the show?If you're unsure about Buffy, you should start with Buffy season 2's third episode when Spike is introduced and the show finally has a proper villain (or, if you really want to be impressed, skip all the way to season 4's tenth episode, Hush, which goes thirty minutes without any dialog).  If you're sure you'll enjoy Buffy (which is how I approached the show, since I was told by many people that it was great) you should start from the beginning.  These episodes are actually very fun due to the fun dialog, even if they don't hold up well after seeing the rest of the show.",5,A good start to an incredible series,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,2063,"['Buffy', 'incredible', 'TV', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'consistent', 'best', 'HBO', 'shows', 'like', 'better', 'anyway', 'incredible', 'characters', 'great', 'variety', 'storylines', 'combine', 'best', 'comedy', 'tragedy.The', 'first', 'season', 'great', 'introduction', 'Buffy', 'not', 'good', 'TV', 'season', 'characters', 'are', 'dead', 'very', 'beginning', 'core', 'actors', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'here', 'Buffy', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'Giles', 'are', 'already', 'delivering', 'great', 'lines', 'other', 'hand', 'monster', 'plots', 'tend', 'be', 'dumb', 'season', 'main', 'villain', 'least', 'favorite', 'entire', '7', 'year', 'run', 'Master', 'very', 'plain', 'compared', 'interesting', 'bad', 'guys', 'will', 'face', 'later', '.I', 'blame', 'crappiness', 'monster', 'plots', 'fact', 'most', 'Buffy', 'writing', 'staff', 'show', 'seasons', '2', '3', 'dialog', 'great', 'rewritten', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'ridiculousness', 'Robot', 'Jane', 'take', 'internet', 'instance.Still', 'even', 'Robot', 'worst', 'episode', 'here', 'one', 'best', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Giles', 'love', 'interest', 'Jenny', 'Calendar', 'episodes', 'purpose', 'Buffy', 'best', 'watched', 'order', 'also', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'show', 'improve', 'quality', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'watch', 'best', 'episodes', 'first', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'worse', 'ones', 'later', 'question', 'will', 'newcomers', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'dumber', 'aspects', 'season', 'one', 'not', 'finish', 'show', ""'re"", 'unsure', 'Buffy', 'should', 'start', 'Buffy', 'season', '2', 'third', 'episode', 'when', 'Spike', 'introduced', 'show', 'finally', 'proper', 'villain', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'impressed', 'skip', 'way', 'season', '4', 'tenth', 'episode', 'Hush', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'dialog', ""'re"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Buffy', 'how', 'approached', 'show', 'was', 'told', 'many', 'people', 'was', 'great', 'should', 'start', 'beginning', 'episodes', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'fun', 'due', 'fun', 'dialog', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'seeing', 'rest', 'show']",N/A

It's great to look back at the characters, and to see the early episodes. Like I said it's great to have the whole season on DVD, but there are some major let downs. First off the picture quality is only decent, it's a few steps above television which isn't that great. I would have thought more effort would have been put into the transfer, though it doesn't mean it's unwatchable, just more of a let down. Another thing I was disapointed in was the extras. What's here is great, the interviews and the commentary with Joss is nice, but why is there so little? For example, he'll talk about a certain episode in the special features and you'll enjoy it and expect a little something for each one, but noooo. It's more of a tease. What extras are here are great, a nice photo gallery, pilot script etc. I may complain a little, however I'm not disapointed in the least, mostly because Buffy is such a great show. Plus the price was good, I still had to knock off a star for the lack of extras and the transfer. Even though it's a little lacking it's by far worth the price.

This show is still superb as I had thought it was when I was a kid, this show is an absolute blast of fun, action, horror, humor, romance, drama, and everything a good show have, great heroes, likable, several great monsters/villains, this show is thankfully not just a vampire show, which is why it is so fun and easy to watch, because, lets face it, the vampire genre was drained of its blood decades before this show even came into play, but this show revived it for its duration of its run. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend Buffy the Vampire Slayer, enough of this Twilight garbage we've had going on these days and these overly sappy vampires and stupid cheesiness, at least Buffy the Vampire Slayer had the ability to make fun of itself and point out the obvious and did not take itself seriously, which is more than I can say for most shows in general these days. The humor made this show so unique, it was not overly graphic in violence or sexual content, and never got boring, it is, has been, and always will be a classic and a show that still has a lot of soul, a lot of heart, and life, and very much has fresh blood coursing through its veins. My favorite episodes of season one, in this order are: Prophecy Girl, The Pack, and Teacher's Pet.Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 1 ***** out of *****Violent Content: 2/10 - Strong Stylized Action/Horror Violence.Sexuality/Nudity: 0/10 - None.",5,"Still the greatest vampire show and horror/action, monster shows ever made!",1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,1514,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'years', 'just', 'finished', 'first', 'season', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'LOVED', 'show', 'still', 'superb', 'had', 'thought', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'show', 'absolute', 'blast', 'fun', 'action', 'horror', 'humor', 'romance', 'drama', 'everything', 'good', 'show', 'have', 'great', 'heroes', 'likable', 'several', 'great', 'monsters/villains', 'show', 'thankfully', 'not', 'just', 'vampire', 'show', 'why', 'so', 'fun', 'easy', 'watch', 'face', 'vampire', 'genre', 'was', 'drained', 'blood', 'decades', 'show', 'even', 'came', 'play', 'show', 'revived', 'duration', 'run', 'HIGHLY', 'HIGHLY', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'enough', 'Twilight', 'garbage', ""'ve"", 'had', 'going', 'days', 'overly', 'sappy', 'vampires', 'stupid', 'cheesiness', 'least', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'had', 'ability', 'make', 'fun', 'point', 'out', 'obvious', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'most', 'shows', 'general', 'days', 'humor', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'unique', 'was', 'not', 'overly', 'graphic', 'violence', 'sexual', 'content', 'never', 'got', 'boring', 'been', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'classic', 'show', 'still', 'lot', 'soul', 'lot', 'heart', 'life', 'very', 'much', 'fresh', 'blood', 'coursing', 'veins', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'order', 'are', 'Prophecy', 'Girl', 'Pack', 'Teacher', 'Pet.Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Season', '1', '*****', '*****Violent', 'Content', '2/10', 'Strong', 'Stylized', 'Action/Horror', 'Violence.Sexuality/Nudity', '0/10', 'None']",N/A
564204,A194FY7FV3B3AA,B00005221I,T,"[9, 10]","The first season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was awesome. I cannot begin to tell you how thrilling it is to sit down and watch a television show every week that has witty dialogue, down-to-earth characters, and action-packed scenes throughout every single episode. It's even better to buy a DVD set in which you don't have to worry about commercials or the terrible agony of a cliff-hanger that won't be explained until at least another week. ""Buffy"" is an amazing show all-around! Most first seasons need a little warming up to do, but not in this case. I can honestly tell you, yes, I am a huge fan of the series, but it is truly a great show. I was eight when the show first premiered. I was sitting in my room one night and was told to go to bed. Of course, being your typical eight-year-old, I turned on the television. Instantly, at age eight, I'm drawn into the world of ""Buffy."" It's a truly captivating show!Season One is definitely one of my favorite seasons. It only contains twelve episodes, due to it being a mid-season replacement, but each one is filled with a new exciting theme. The main villain, however, is The Master Vampire. Buffy's objective is to stop him from rising, while dodging everyone he sends to try to stop her. Aside from this problem, there are a couple of episodes that have nothing to do with him, which I think is nice because it offered a break with side-episodes such as ""Witch"" and ""Out of Mind, Out of Sight."" Even with an outline of only twelve episodes, Joss Whedon (creator) and friends still manage to fit in these extras without taking away from the main point.As for the actual DVD boxed set, it couldn't have gotten much better. It has a few nice photos and a small booklet inside which describes each episode. It folds out three times to reveal three discs, each containing four episodes. Those episodes are as follows:Welcome to the Hellmouth:Buffy arrives at her new school, Sunnydale High, only to find out that she can't escape her true destiny. There she meets her new Watcher, Giles, and makes a couple of friends, Willow and Xander.The Harvest:The second half of ""Welcome to the Hellmouth."" Buffy and friends materialize for the first time to fight off The Master's vampire gang intended to harvest Sunnydale and release him.Witch:One of my favorite Season One episodes. This first non-vampire episode finds the gang dealing with someone harming members of the cheerleading squad.Teacher's Pet:With the science teacher dead, things become even more mysterious when kids start disappearing after visiting the new substitute!Never Kill A Boy on the First Date:Buffy's attempt at a normal life is shattered when a date is ruined by The Master's latest scheme.The Pack:Xander starts acting strangely after a trip to a forbidden part of the zoo -- containing possessed hyenas.Angel:Buffy gets to know Angel a little better -- for the worse!I Robot, You Jane:Willow is seduced by a demon through the computer.The Puppet Show:My other favorite episode about a demonic puppet featured in the school's talent show.Nightmares:The season's most wild episode where the gangs' nightmares become reality and anything can happen. In my top-three list of Season One favorites.Out of Mind, Out of Sight:Sometimes when people are ignored, they disappear. Only they usually don't come back and try to murder everyone that ignored them.....Prophecy Girl:The show's season finale in which Buffy faces The Master and discovers her fate.Bonus features include:- Exclusive interviews with Joss Whedon & David Boreanaz- Full-length commentary for ""Welcome..."" & ""The Harvest""- Photo Gallery- Character Bios, and much, much more!With classic episodes such as ""Witch"" and ""Nightmares,"" Season One is clearly the best jump-start a show could have!

Jones,"[35, 37]","Picking up just a few months after the movie left off, (which starred Kristy Swanson), season one evolved around the appearance of many of the now key characters of this series.The first was Buffy Summers, who in the series is played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, who is far superior as Buffy than Krusty. She begins as being resentful as being &quot;The Chosen One&quot;, and thought her vampire slaying days were at an end. A stroke of fate placed her directly on the Hellmouth when she switched schools, forcing her to again slay all of those nasties.The second is the dark, mysterious and brooding &quot;vampire with a soul&quot; apropriately named as Angel aka Angelus. He is portrayed by David Borandaz, who can ignite his character with both charm and terror sometimes at the same time.Next up is Ruport Gyles, (Anthony Stewart Head) on the outside a Clark Kentish mild mannered, occasionally dim-witted libriarian. But in reality he is Buffy's watcher, who at times has a strength (both outer and inner) which he may not realize he has.Not to forget her two best friends, Willow and Xander (Alyson Hannagan and Nicholas Brandon), they both have their strengths, Willow her computer wizardry and Xander his . . . um well, he's just one of the girls [as Buffy so aptly points out in one of the episodes in this set].We can't forget Cordellia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), while she fancies herself as the self-imposed queen of the school, and a nemisis of Buffy, when push comes to shove, she finds herself standing alongside Buffy fighting the demons (when she herself isn't being held captive by one that is).Finally the seasonal characters, in this season it's the Master (Mark Metcalf). Everything that a Vampire is, is in him, thought to be one of the last &quot;true&quot; vampires, he rises from his sub-terrianian grave ready to be released from his sub-terrianian prison, waiting to kill the only thing that stands in his way . . . the Slayer.On this three disk set are all 12 of the 1st season episodes:01.

564212,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005221I,trebe,"[1, 3]","Programs on Fox, are not a regular part of my TV menu, so believe it or not, prior to purchasing this set, I had never seen a complete episode of ""Buffy"" before.  The program premiered in 1997, and is still going strong, and this seemed like a good opportunity to check out this series from its genesis, and see what all the fuss is about.The series gets off to a strong start with the opening episode ""Welcome to Hellmouth"", where the characters are introduced, and premise of vampires running loose in southern California, and being challenged by beautiful teenage heroine Buffy Summers, and her high school friends, is established.  Buying into the basic storyline is essential.  This is made easier by the quirky and engaging characters, strong writing, ""hip"" dialog, and relatively well done action sequences.  The American high school experience, though it has certainly evolved over time, contains elements of commonality that make it somewhat universal.  No matter how many years have past, most of us can still identify in some way, with these characters, and situations.  If you can't believe that there are vampires running loose in California, then this program I'm afraid is simply not for you.Buffy, the series, travels an interesting path, as it targets a young audience, and seeks to present a mixture of humor, horror, science fiction and adventure.  This is a challenging task, given the limitations of the medium, and the target audience.  The focus of the episodes varies, as the different elements are emphasized.  With such a diverse range of subject matter, it is to be expected that the program does not always succeed in delivering a high quality, original episode every time out.  Still, the overall story quality of the 12 episodes of Season One, is pretty good.The ensemble cast, is more than a collection of ""beautiful people"".  These young actors are quite talented.  Sarah Michelle Gellar, makes you believe in this unconventional story.  Though it is often hard to believe that this character is supposed to be only sixteen years old.  Alyson Hannigan simply shines as ""Willow"".  And the rest of the cast of is also very capable, with Nicholas Brendon, David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter.  Anthony Stewart Head, is vital in the role of ""Giles"", providing guidance, and when necessary an unsteady physical presence.  Regarding the ""look"" of the show, this is not a criticism, merely an observation, but this show appears to be very ""white"".  It doesn't seem to realistically reflect the ethnicity of southern California, with few Latino, Black or Asian characters featured.  Perhaps this changes over time.Creator and executive producer Joss Whedon's comments are featured on the first two episodes.  His comments, delivered in a rather droll manner, are both extremely informative, and humorous.  Always conscious the budgetary constraints, his insights are so enlightening to a newbie.  Too bad he wasn't able to comment on more episodes, but at least this collection has some commentary tracks, few DVD collections of TV programs feature them.  I must disagree with one of Whedon's assertions concerning the lighting of the show always being well done, as there are numerous instances where the picture quality was a bit too dark and grainy, but that's not unexpected for a TV production.This compact, attractively packaged set, covered with images of the beautiful Ms. Gellar, is probably a ""must"" for long-time fans.

564214,A38JKOT65RLZ9Q,B00005221I,Wayne Rossi,"[1, 1]","The first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was only 12 episodes long, but it is packed from end to end with some of the most worthwhile material to ever be broadcast on television.  From the gripping initial two-parter to the amazing season finale, even when the show has to slow down and do an ""average"" episode, it is still moving characters and overarching plot forward in almost every scene.The two-parter -- ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"" seems to overcome the problems of a new series effortlessly, integrating everyone into the plot and kicking things off spectacularly.  And Buffy set high expectations for itself every time.  The third episode, ""Witch,"" was captivating from end to end and got the normal episodes moving on a good pace.  ""Teacher's Pet"" is the first of the ""average"" bunch, but it is still a well told story.We begin to see the development of a trend in Buffy's social life in ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date,"" which sets her up as not being able to have a normal relationship - ever.  (The twist it takes on the boy's reaction is fascinating as well.)  ""The Pack"" is actually rather frightening, all told, mostly because of how it has Xander in the group that is overcome with a curse and thereby tempers how it will be handled.  ""Angel"" contains one of the greatest revelations of the series, and it sets up the romance that would define so much of the first three seasons of Buffy.  ""I Robot...You Jane"" does a great job of introducing a fan favorite character, Jenny Calendar, in a rather amusing twist on a demon unleashed plot.""The Puppet Show"" likewise pulls a great twist in its individual plot, and introduces Armin Shimerman as the most memorable of the unlucky principals of Sunnydale High.  ""Nightmares"" is a fascinating tale of reality being merged with the characters' darkest dreams; a LOT of character comes out of it as well.  ""Out of Mind, Out of Sight"" does a good job with suspense and an invisible girl.  And it is wrapped up with a resounding bang in ""Prophecy Girl.""Buffy, from its very beginning, loved to push the envelope of its horror stereotypes in just the right ways, while keeping enough in tact that it would be quite comfortable for the viewer.  The vampires are great, especially Mark Metcalf as the Master, and Angel is the exception that proves the rule:  vampires are bad, 'kay?  Having vampires be the bad guys in a world of Anne Rice novels and Vampire: the Masquerade was a daring move, and I think Buffy pulled it off with style.  It also gave a nicely rotating list of monsters with enough in the way of inventive twists that it avoided becoming a predictable monster-of-the-week show.  And through it all, the season-length plot was advanced at a solid pace.  Even more amazingly, the writing was generally in the top notch for TV screenwriting.  Yeah, it was demonstrably written for television, but the overall impact is still a lot better than most TV shows get.Then there's the acting.  Quite frankly, I think the main cast of Buffy for the first few seasons was one of the finer assemblages of actors on a TV cast.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is definitive in her portrayal of the heroine who would love to be normal.  Anthony Stewart Head, as her Watcher, pulls off something amazing with his academic-but-deep character.  Nicholas Brendon's Xander is generally the show whipping boy, but he retains a spark throughout.  Alyson Hannigan's Willow opens up the geekish girl type a lot.  Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia gets more interesting than a simple beauty queen.  And of course David Boreanaz gets to be brooding and romance buffy as Angel.  The bunch are probably one of the better ensembles you'll get a chance to see, and every episode of Buffy seems to feature them at their best.  The villains are good, too, especially watching Mark Metcalf chew scenery as the vampiric Master (a very prototypical villain, less interesting as a concept but a good introduction).Buffy the Vampire Slayer, despite the short run of its first season as a replacement show, was the entire package right from the start.

564219,A18RJ91B28WFJ2,B00005221I,zebrastripes,"[0, 0]","Before I bought this DVD set I knew very little about Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I heard it mentioned from time to time but never caught it on television - I grew up being more of a ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"" girl. In a way, I am very glad that I did not get into this series until recently. Now that I am older, I can watch a program for it's depth and messages instead of the bubblegum appeal.When I picked up the case I was really drawn into the beautiful cover art and thought it would be worth a watch. While I was expecting something very compelling from the start, I was very surprised. This season of Buffy is not nearly up to notch with the next ones to come. Some of the acting is a little shaky, the majority of the episodes involve dumb throwaway plots and monsters, and it just comes off as corny at times. Episodes like Puppet Show and I Robot, You Jane have overused and uninteresting plots. No one was really expanding their mind for these stories. I did enjoy the filler episode, Out of Sight, Out of Mind, and found it to be somewhat interesting and useful for the next season considering that Cordelia will become more of a main character in the next 2 seasons.The format of this really reminds me of the cartoon Sailor Moon. A beautiful but somewhat ditzy young girl is called upon to fight evil and every episode deals with a monster of the day leading up to the main evil who must be fought in the final episode. The majority of these episodes are hard to get through and full of silly story lines. But what kept me watching was the witty dialogue and two stand out episodes, Angel and Prophecy Girl. They really point towards something that could turn special and could easily slide into the Season 2 episode pile! The main setup of characters are rather likeable and mesh well together, in my opinion. Things for the most part are light and happy, and hey that is nice to see in the Buffy universe having watched some of the later seasons now.It was a bit hard to get through but this DVD set was worth watching to get to Season 2, which I have bought and watched - I am definitely more impressed. If you have the patience I would recommend this series! Buy Season 1 to understand the plot and characters from the beginning but do not judge the entire show from this box set. It gets much better and more entertaining. You will eventually understand the hype and following it has gained.
