I liked it then and I like it now...I viewed it again last night for the first time in over 20 years (having seen it on HBO and Cinemax several times in the mid-80's). Having lived near Tucson, AZ since 1990, I remembered it was filmed around here and wanted to see it again. Jan Michael Vincent and Key Lenz team up in this gritty story of a blackballed trucker fighting a corrupt system. All in all, it's a good movie, but I can't give it 5 stars simply because the ending is somewhat abrupt, and there is no apparent accountability for the two murders in the film. While I would love to see this out on a studio-released DVD, I would also say it could be redone just as well by the right director (not Tarentino!). It reflects 70's society/culture and as such, may contain some politically incorrect phrases that may offend some folks. Kay Lenz portrays a somewhat ignorant bumpkin as Hummer's wife, but does an adequate job with her role. JMV does very well with the material playing the frustrated veteran who only wants to drive a truck in his father's footsteps. I highly recommend this movie for any collection - if only for the truck-crashing-through-the-""Glass House""-sign scene!P.S.

Ferrigno ""firehouse444""","[21, 21]","Ever popular B-grade trucker movie starring square jawed Jan-Michael Vincent as a returned Vietnam veteran who comes home to Tuscon, Arizona to take over his fathers trucking business and marry his teenage sweetheart. However, the well meaning Carrol Jo Hummer (Vincent) soon finds to his dismay that wholesale corruption has permeated the trucking game, and he is forced to either haul illegal loads of cigarettes and slot machines, or he doesn't work at all.Directed by Jonathon Kaplan ( who later directed many episodes of the hit medico TV series ""ER"" ), the movie ticks along at a brisk pace and for a modest production, it hits all the right notes. Waif like Kay Lenz is believable as Carrol Jo Hummer's equally strong headed wife, Jerri, and serial cowboy star Slim Pickens ( in obligatory ten gallon hat, bolo ties and embroided suits ) is a hoot as friendly, but weak willed trucking depot boss, Duane Haller. A young Martin Kove is excellent as the taciturn bully, Klem ( breaking Carrol Jo's ribs with a tyre iron ), and another Western genre regular, L.Q. Jones, is equally impressive as the leering Buck Wessell. Plus, keep an eye out for wonderful character actor Dick Miller playing a fellow trucker named R. ""Birdie"" Corman.  ( A film about independant truckers with a sly reference to Hollywood's maverick independant film producer ! )The truck stunt work was capably handled by noted Hollywood stunt driver, Carey Loftin, who had previously handled the stunt driving in such memorable films as ""Duel"", ""Bullitt"", ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Diamonds are Forever"", and the creative cinematography of the big rigs was provided by Fred J. Koenekamp. ""White Line Fever"" was quite a success upon it's release (especially on the drive in circuit ) as it was cashing in on the then popularity of CB radio and the image of truckers as knights of the highways struggling against big business and politics.
