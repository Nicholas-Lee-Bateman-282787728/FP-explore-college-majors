The brown horse in front is actually MY horse Rocky.But overall it is a good movie with a good message. It doesn't matter your size or strength, you can make a difference.

I was unable to see the movie in the theaters but was able to rent it when it went out on DVD. This movie has got to be one of the most inspirational movies I've seen. I loved it so much, that I wanted to have my parents see it. My Dad, ever the critic, said it was better than he thought it would be and my Mom said that it was one of the best she's seen.Sadly, this movie did not get the recognition it deserved in the box office. If you're looking for an inspirational movie that leaves a good message in the end, then this is the movie for you! :)I admit, I originally saw the movie only because Gillian Anderson was in it. If she hadn't been cast in the movie, I would have most likely not seen the movie at all. If you guys do see it for the first time, please tell your friends and family about it.

Based on a children's book, 'Freak the Mighty', the film manages to portray the challenges and friendship of two special young people without being patronizing.Max, played brilliantly by Eldon Henson, is a slow boy, big for his age, whose mother was killed by his father, who is now serving a prison sentence. Max is being raised by his grandparents, the appropriately weary Gena Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton. Max has failed 7th grade twice, and is the butt of teasing and jokes. His life is changed when Kevin, played by Kieran Culkin (Macauley's more-talented younger brother) moves next door with his single mother, well played by Sharon Stone. Kevin is physically disabled, with a degenerative bone disorder. He has compensated for his disability by being a genius. He is also stronger than Max, the only thing he lacks is Max's physical strength. The two work together, with Max being Kevin's legs, and Kevin being Max's brain.The world can be an empty place for people who are ""different"", and Max learns and grows from his friendship with Kevin. The movie never resorts to cheap sentimentality, and this was one of the first films to make me cry in a long time. I don't agree with the criticism that Sharon Stone is too attractive to be Kevin's poor mom. All kinds of people have children with disabilities. There was no need to make Sharon Stone less beautiful, since this film is about the boys, and she is the mom, a supporting role, and her good looks are not really an issue.I was disappointed in Gillian Anderson's performance as a white trash biker chick. She seems to be borrowing from the Sandy Dennis school of facial twitches, and feels a need to resort to a southern accent to emphasize that her character is from the wrong side of the tracks. Other than that, the movie is excellent, particularly the performance of Eldin Henson, who has a great future ahead of him.",4,A film about special kids that doesn't patronize,1040515200,"12 22, 2002",2002,1992,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'was', 'bowled', 'over', 'performances', 'young', 'actors', 'Based', 'children', 'book', 'Mighty', 'film', 'portray', 'challenges', 'friendship', 'two', 'special', 'young', 'people', 'being', 'patronizing.Max', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Eldon', 'Henson', 'slow', 'boy', 'big', 'age', 'mother', 'was', 'killed', 'father', 'who', 'now', 'serving', 'prison', 'sentence', 'Max', 'being', 'raised', 'grandparents', 'appropriately', 'weary', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Max', 'failed', '7th', 'grade', 'twice', 'butt', 'teasing', 'jokes', 'life', 'changed', 'when', 'Kevin', 'played', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'Macauley', 'more-talented', 'younger', 'brother', 'next', 'door', 'single', 'mother', 'well', 'played', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Kevin', 'physically', 'disabled', 'degenerative', 'bone', 'disorder', 'compensated', 'disability', 'being', 'genius', 'also', 'stronger', 'Max', 'only', 'thing', 'Max', 'physical', 'strength', 'two', 'work', 'together', 'Max', 'being', 'Kevin', 'legs', 'Kevin', 'being', 'Max', 'brain.The', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'empty', 'place', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'Max', 'learns', 'grows', 'friendship', 'Kevin', 'movie', 'never', 'cheap', 'sentimentality', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'make', 'cry', 'long', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'criticism', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'too', 'attractive', 'be', 'Kevin', 'poor', 'mom', 'kinds', 'people', 'have', 'children', 'disabilities', 'was', 'need', 'make', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'less', 'beautiful', 'film', 'boys', 'mom', 'supporting', 'role', 'good', 'looks', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'issue.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'performance', 'white', 'trash', 'biker', 'chick', 'be', 'borrowing', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'school', 'facial', 'twitches', 'need', 'resort', 'southern', 'accent', 'emphasize', 'character', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'Other', 'movie', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'performance', 'Eldin', 'Henson', 'who', 'great', 'future', 'ahead']",The Mighty

464523,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6305428247,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","THE MIGHTY (1998, 100 minutes) was an odd little film that I recall seeing new. I only remembered to review it because I just saw it again last night. It made something of an impression back in '98 and then I just forgot it.An oversized junior high school student (Max=Eldon Henson) who has failed to enter 8th grade twice already, meets a small 7th grader (Kevin=Kieran Culkin) who is terribly deformed and brainy as Einstein. The two team up, and that's it.As it happens, Max requires remedial reading which he can barely handle. Little Kevin is his reading tutor, and together the two manage to embark on a reading adventure about King Arthur, which spurs them into their friendship and a union something like two lone knights on a quest. In this film, it is a quest not for ""normalcy"" - it is a quest to obtain and appreciate self-respect.In a weird and (in my opinion) unnecessary twist to the story, Max's murderous father is released from prison - a nightmare scenario for Max - and of course goes straight for him, kidnaps him, blah blah blah. I saw no reason for such a 'low-blow' (my term, don't steal it) in the story. A 'low-blow' is when some false pretense of awful drama is inserted into a film without rhyme or reason.I did not expect such a remarkable performance from young Culkin, who has stood in his vacant brother's even more deformed shadow all his life - yet this hard-working young fellow has had his small share of interesting supporting roles, most notably as the gay roommate inScott Pilgrim vs. The World(see my review).With the talents of Harry Dean Stanton, Gena Rowlands, and Sharon Stone.",4,"A not-so-typical, touching coming-of-age film",1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,1621,"['MIGHTY', '1998', '100', 'minutes', 'was', 'odd', 'little', 'film', 'recall', 'seeing', 'new', 'only', 'remembered', 'review', 'just', 'saw', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'made', 'something', 'impression', 'back', ""'98"", 'then', 'just', 'forgot', 'it.An', 'oversized', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Max=Eldon', 'Henson', 'who', 'failed', 'enter', '8th', 'grade', 'twice', 'already', 'small', '7th', 'grader', 'Kevin=Kieran', 'Culkin', 'who', 'terribly', 'deformed', 'brainy', 'Einstein', 'two', 'team', 'up', 'it.As', 'Max', 'remedial', 'reading', 'can', 'barely', 'handle', 'Little', 'Kevin', 'reading', 'tutor', 'together', 'two', 'manage', 'embark', 'reading', 'adventure', 'King', 'Arthur', 'friendship', 'union', 'something', 'two', 'lone', 'knights', 'quest', 'film', 'quest', 'not', 'normalcy', 'quest', 'obtain', 'appreciate', 'self-respect.In', 'weird', 'opinion', 'unnecessary', 'twist', 'story', 'Max', 'murderous', 'father', 'released', 'prison', 'nightmare', 'scenario', 'Max', 'course', 'straight', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'saw', 'reason', 'such', ""'low-blow"", 'term', 'do', ""n't"", 'steal', 'story', ""'low-blow"", 'when', 'false', 'pretense', 'awful', 'drama', 'inserted', 'film', 'rhyme', 'reason.I', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'such', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'young', 'Culkin', 'who', 'stood', 'vacant', 'brother', 'even', 'more', 'deformed', 'shadow', 'life', 'yet', 'hard-working', 'young', 'fellow', 'had', 'small', 'share', 'interesting', 'supporting', 'roles', 'most', 'notably', 'gay', 'roommate', 'inScott', 'Pilgrim', 'vs', 'World', 'see', 'review', 'talents', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'Sharon', 'Stone']",The Mighty

Keiran's character is slowly growing too big for his body and his health is diminishing rapidly. In the time they are together, Keiran teaches Elden to read (Knights of the round table) and learn to think and write for himself.

Keiran Culkin (MacCulley's younger brother) plays Kevin, a young man with a serious disease which his internal organs grow faster than he does, which leaves him physically disabled for a lot of things... Elden Henson plays Max, a big kid for anybody's standard, but huge for an 8th grader, who thinks he is quite stupid, and lets everybody else believe that also. There is a group of really mean boys while Max and they are in Gym class playing basketball, the mean boys play &quot;bowling for cripples&quot;, and aim for Kevin, and just like bowling ball pins: down he goes, and Max gets blamed for it. Max gets detention, and he is assigned to a tutor to help him read. As it turns out, his tutor is Kevin, which is noticed by both of them. The book that Kevin has Max read is &quot;King Arthur and his Knights&quot;... Max stumbles around reading, so Kevin tells Max this: &quot;Every word is a picture. Every sentence is a picture. All you do is let your imagination connect them together.&quot; {I actually had to get my DVD into action just to get that quote directly from Kieran!} Max begins to realise that reading is more than just words... Kevin and Max, are at a Festival where there are fireworks, and Kevin cannot see the fireworks as he is so short. Max, realising that Kevin cannot see them, picks him up and places him on his shoulders to watch the spectacle... Once the show is done, the bullies see Max and Kevin, and Kevin accuses the lead bully of being a cretin, and the bullies react, and to give chase and to attack them. Kevin, with foresight, kicks Max into moving and together they become Knight and Steed (Kevin the Knight with Max as the Steed) and manage to avoid the bullies, and get them picked up by the cops... From this, a friendship forms, with Kevin getting Max to become more and more like one of Arthur's Knights... Kevin teaches Max to strive for everything. This movie is great. My mother cried at the end, I cry at the end, my FATHER even had tears at the end... I cannot give this movie enough stars... 10, 15, 20: Still not enough...!

464540,A9N7QD5VVZS3F,6305428247,"Lori L. Graham ""yose""","[40, 42]","How in the HELL did this movie get lost in theatres? Why didn't every critic in America tell the world to see it?I remember when I first heard that this book, FREAK THE MIGHTY (by Rodman Philbrick), was going to be made into a movie and that Gillian Anderson was going to play a small role. Well, I went ahead and read the book because (a) I'm an X-Files fan, and (b) I wanted to know what so drew her to the project that she was willing to play a less than a major role.The book just tore me apart-- it wasn't just that I'd been a misfit myself in my youth, but the fact that it dealt with sometimes amazing, sometimes painful situations in such a clear-eyed way, never pandering to or underestimating the intelligence of the reader.This film, while not adhering to the book to the letter (but damned close) kept the SPIRIT of the book intact, and for that I credit not only the director and screenwriter but the cast. Everyone involved seems to be most concerned with truth-- not is it dramatic, is it sad, is it funny, but is it HONEST?While I credit all involved parties with making this film work so well, I have to say that NONE of it would have worked had it not been for the two leads, Elden Hensen and Kieran Culkin. These two ASTOUNDING young men are so utterly concerned with their characters as human beings that there is not a single false note in either performance. Going in, Culkin has an additional challenge/handicap-- the wiseacre type honed by his brother Macauley might well have been expected here, given the no-apologies intelligence that characterizes Kevin/Freak. But Culkin has no interest in just getting laughs-- he seems entirely aware that there are more important treasures to be had from this material.That's not to say that there aren't moments that make you smile or yes, laugh, but they happen through the comedy of CHARACTER, not situation. There are no cheap emotions on the screen, nor do they try to elicit them from the viewer. When you laugh and cry at this movie, it is because you feel a PART of the proceedings, not that this is something put in front of you merely to entertain. It is obvious why such stellar actors (Anderson, Sharon Stone, Harry Dean Stanton, Gena Rowlands, James Gandolfini) were drawn to this project-- there is more than enough well-drawn, intelligent material to go around, even to the smallest of roles. I also felt that the film improved on the novel by giving it a bit more an ending; the book just kind of STOPPED, and I was glad to see a bit more resolution. These characters deserved it.I give the film 4 stars rather than 5 because of (a) the all-too-real violence and threatened violence seems jarring at times (as it did in the book as well) and (b) the lack of extras on this edition (a truncated behind the scenes featurette and NO commentary tracks, which is positively CRIMINAL given the talent involved).So even though neither the film nor the presentation (although the music video by Sting is kind of fun) is perfect, do NOT let that dissuade you from seeing this film.

464541,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,6305428247,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[17, 18]","Oh wow.  I fell in love with this movie from the moment the music started to play.  The music is Celtic, and it's really outstanding.  But it's Eldan Henson and Kieran Culkin who really steal the show.The film starts off with Max Kane (Henson).  Max is in 7th grade, but he is at least two feet taller than everyone else in his grade.  He is always being teased by bullies for his size, his illiteracy, and his infamous father.Then a kid named Kevin Dillan (Culkin) moves into the neighborhood. Kevin is also in 7th grade, but he is very small and has a birth defect that forces him to walk on crutches.  He is also extremely smart.  Bullies tease him, too.Soon, Kevin and Max became inseparable friends.  Max became Kevin's legs, and Kevin became Max's brain.  By themselves, Max and Kevin were just freaks of nature who were always teased.  But when they are together, they are called &quot;Freak the Mighty&quot;!  And then what happens is.....what, did you really think I'd tell you what happens next?The script in this movie is absolutely adorable.  Here are some of the quotes:--&quot;So you're a pacifist.....yeah, a pacifist. You know, 'pass on the fist'?&quot;--&quot;I said, you're a cretin!.....yeah, a cretin!  C-R-E-T-I-N!  Look it up in the dictionary and you'll find your mugshot!&quot;--&quot;My father was a magician.  He heard the words, 'birth defect', and disappeared.&quot;--&quot;Don't think of it as a friendship.  Think of it as a partnership.  You need a brain and I need legs.  And the Wizard of Oz doesn't live in South Cincinnati.&quot;--&quot;Every word is part of a picture.  Every sentence IS a picture.  All you do is let your imagination connect them together.....if you HAVE an imagination, that is.&quot;Plus many more.  The above quotes were all said by Kevin Dillan.  But my favorite quote is the last line of the movie. You won't forget it for a while.The script is hilarious.  The music is catchy.  The acting is all top-notch.  And the ending is so tragic.....it all adds up to a truly unforgettable film.  If you have a psyche, you will love this film.  Watch it ASAP.P.S. Yes, I am only 14 years old, but parents shouldn't be too concerned about the PG-13 rating.  There's no sex, no nudity, no drug content, no profanity, and almost no on-screen violence.  Little kids may be frightened at times, but this movie is overall no more inappropriate than the PG-rated &quot;Simon Birch&quot;.  If your kids have seen &quot;Simon Birch&quot;, then they can--and MUST--see &quot;The Mighty&quot;!P.P.S.

Miller ""Mary  Miller""","[0, 0]","I understand it is un understated film for many, and as a owner of ""Simon Birch"" (yes I like that film), I feel that folks have under rated, appreciation of this film.  I can't speak for the DVD quality, because I don't have this movie (yet).  I still can talk about this movie from the perspective that this film is presented; as a person who was bullied, disabled, and needed some kind of mythos in life to parallel what I faced as a kid/teen.  I think most kids need this form of understanding in their life to feel empowered and not just pushed around (either by other kids or by parents), but to know that their lives have power in and of their own making.  Yes, Simon Birch does demonstrate this as well (""I know I was sent here for a reason""), but perhaps to the average person, too vague and too obscure.  Yes, I know that the 'knights of the roundtable' has been done (or over done for years) as the myth base, but you need only look at the size of Max to realize why he would choose king arthur as his myth.  It follows also the hero's journey of someone who reluctantly must face a journey they do not intend to go on, but come out vanquishing fears and saving their humanity...this is what Joseph Campbell talked about for some 80 hours at the Lucas ranch about; the importance of the hero's journey to mirror and parallel in our lives.Is it realistic from a disabled perspective?  Well, not as realistic as it could have been, if they actually had used a disabled person to play in the movie (like they used a little person in Simon Birch), but then again, we can set that aside for a minute.  Was it realistic about finding out about one's family, etc?  Yes.  The bullying was pretty standard to what most people face (Simon Birch on the other hand, was less realistic to the time; Kids were almost killed by non disabled kids in school, if they could even try to attend. Most were sent to special education schools across town, where education was NOT taught, but coloring was the order of the day).  This was pre Ed-504 (1974), where equal access was simply not even considered (unless your parents did what mine did, lie to the school district and get me tested after passing two grades so they couldn't refuse me entrance to the school).I think that if you go beyond trying to have a swashbuckling movie, but are owning it because of it's warmth, humor and understanding of folks that are clearly different, you will find Mighty, mighty.",5,"Mighty, is that, Mighty...",1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,2455,"['understand', 'un', 'understated', 'film', 'many', 'owner', 'Simon', 'Birch', 'yes', 'like', 'film', 'feel', 'folks', 'have', 'rated', 'appreciation', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'DVD', 'quality', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'yet', 'still', 'can', 'talk', 'movie', 'perspective', 'film', 'presented', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'bullied', 'disabled', 'needed', 'kind', 'mythos', 'life', 'parallel', 'what', 'faced', 'kid/teen', 'think', 'most', 'kids', 'need', 'form', 'understanding', 'life', 'feel', 'empowered', 'not', 'just', 'pushed', 'around', 'either', 'other', 'kids', 'parents', 'know', 'lives', 'have', 'power', 'own', 'making', 'Yes', 'Simon', 'Birch', 'demonstrate', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'was', 'sent', 'here', 'reason', 'perhaps', 'average', 'person', 'too', 'vague', 'too', 'obscure', 'Yes', 'know', ""'knights"", 'roundtable', 'been', 'done', 'done', 'years', 'myth', 'base', 'need', 'only', 'look', 'size', 'Max', 'realize', 'why', 'would', 'choose', 'king', 'arthur', 'myth', 'also', 'hero', 'journey', 'someone', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'must', 'face', 'journey', 'do', 'not', 'intend', 'go', 'come', 'out', 'vanquishing', 'fears', 'saving', 'humanity', 'what', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'talked', '80', 'hours', 'Lucas', 'ranch', 'importance', 'hero', 'journey', 'mirror', 'parallel', 'lives.Is', 'disabled', 'perspective', 'Well', 'not', 'as', 'realistic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'actually', 'had', 'used', 'disabled', 'person', 'play', 'movie', 'used', 'little', 'person', 'Simon', 'Birch', 'then', 'again', 'can', 'set', 'aside', 'minute', 'Was', 'realistic', 'finding', 'out', 'one', 'family', 'etc', 'Yes', 'bullying', 'was', 'pretty', 'standard', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'face', 'Simon', 'Birch', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'less', 'realistic', 'time', 'Kids', 'were', 'almost', 'killed', 'non', 'disabled', 'kids', 'school', 'could', 'even', 'try', 'attend', 'Most', 'were', 'sent', 'special', 'education', 'schools', 'town', 'where', 'education', 'was', 'NOT', 'taught', 'coloring', 'was', 'order', 'day', 'was', 'pre', 'Ed-504', '1974', 'where', 'equal', 'access', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'even', 'considered', 'parents', 'did', 'what', 'mine', 'did', 'lie', 'school', 'district', 'get', 'tested', 'passing', 'two', 'grades', 'could', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'entrance', 'school', '.I', 'think', 'go', 'trying', 'have', 'swashbuckling', 'movie', 'are', 'owning', 'warmth', 'humor', 'understanding', 'folks', 'are', 'clearly', 'different', 'will', 'find', 'Mighty', 'mighty']",The Mighty
464543,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305428247,Matthew Horner,"[2, 2]","The Mighty may not be destined to become a classic, but it scores a lot of points for dealing insightfully with the offbeat theme of two kids who use imagination to overcome the bad hands life has dealt them. It has a lot of heart [I know that sounds corny!] and even more soul.Maxwell Kane [Elden Hensen] appears to be the dumbest kid in Cincinnati. He is easily the biggest student in seventh grade because he has failed it twice. Despite his size, he is quiet and passive. He lives with his grandparents, whom he calls Gram and Grim. This is not a happy house. Its inhabitants are haunted by the past.Into the neighborhood come Kevin Dillon [Kieran Culkin] and his Mom [Sharon Stone]. Kevin is suffering from a rare disease which has caused him to become a virtual cripple and has given him a hunchback. He is extremely intelligent, has a sharp sense of humor as well and lives in a dream world.The boys' first two encounters do not go well at all. When Maxwell is sent to remedial reading class, he finds to his embarrassment that Kevin, who is two years younger, is his tutor. But Kevin turns out to have a great deal of patience and decides that Maxwell must read King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable. He says that words are part of a picture, sentences are pictures, and imagination puts the pieces of the picture together. It is through imagination that the bond is formed.One night at a fireworks display, where little Kevin can see nothing, Maxwell impulsively hoists him onto his shoulders. From that moment on, this becomes the way the two travel together. Kevin is the brains, Maxwell is the strength, and in their own strange way, they become one. Together they can get through almost anything. They have many experiences and adventures. These are all very real. Some are dangerous and scary, but in their heads, they have become a knight called Freak the Mighty. In the end, both must confront their separate demons, but because of their friendship, they are able to handle them.The adults in the cast play second fiddle to these remarkable young actors. One or both of them are on screen in nearly all the movie. These are difficult roles. Kieran Culkin seems to be on track to become the actor his brother, Macauly Culkin, once seemed destined to be. Elden Hensen is equally serious about his career.It is difficult to categorize The Mighty. Its themes are too mature for most children, and many adults do not like movies about children. The subject matter might at times be considered grim, yet there is a surprising amount of humor. I suspect that it is one of those films which will become cult favorites after a decade or so.",4,"Full of heart and soul, difficult to categorize",1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,2655,"['Mighty', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'destined', 'become', 'classic', 'lot', 'points', 'dealing', 'insightfully', 'offbeat', 'theme', 'two', 'kids', 'who', 'use', 'imagination', 'overcome', 'bad', 'hands', 'life', 'dealt', 'lot', 'heart', '[', 'know', 'corny', ']', 'even', 'more', 'soul.Maxwell', 'Kane', '[', 'Elden', 'Hensen', ']', 'be', 'dumbest', 'kid', 'Cincinnati', 'easily', 'biggest', 'student', 'seventh', 'grade', 'failed', 'twice', 'size', 'quiet', 'passive', 'grandparents', 'whom', 'Gram', 'Grim', 'not', 'happy', 'house', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'haunted', 'past.Into', 'neighborhood', 'come', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', '[', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', ']', 'Mom', '[', 'Sharon', 'Stone', ']', 'Kevin', 'suffering', 'rare', 'disease', 'caused', 'become', 'virtual', 'cripple', 'given', 'hunchback', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'sharp', 'sense', 'humor', 'well', 'dream', 'world.The', 'boys', 'first', 'two', 'encounters', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'well', 'When', 'Maxwell', 'sent', 'remedial', 'reading', 'class', 'embarrassment', 'Kevin', 'who', 'two', 'years', 'younger', 'tutor', 'Kevin', 'out', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'patience', 'Maxwell', 'must', 'read', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Knights', 'Roundtable', 'words', 'are', 'part', 'picture', 'sentences', 'are', 'pictures', 'imagination', 'pieces', 'picture', 'together', 'imagination', 'bond', 'formed.One', 'night', 'fireworks', 'display', 'where', 'little', 'Kevin', 'can', 'see', 'nothing', 'Maxwell', 'impulsively', 'shoulders', 'moment', 'way', 'two', 'travel', 'together', 'Kevin', 'brains', 'Maxwell', 'strength', 'own', 'strange', 'way', 'become', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'almost', 'anything', 'have', 'many', 'experiences', 'adventures', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'are', 'dangerous', 'scary', 'heads', 'have', 'become', 'knight', 'called', 'Freak', 'Mighty', 'end', 'must', 'confront', 'separate', 'demons', 'friendship', 'are', 'able', 'handle', 'them.The', 'adults', 'cast', 'play', 'second', 'fiddle', 'remarkable', 'young', 'actors', 'One', 'are', 'screen', 'nearly', 'movie', 'are', 'difficult', 'roles', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'be', 'track', 'become', 'actor', 'brother', 'Macauly', 'Culkin', 'once', 'seemed', 'destined', 'be', 'Elden', 'Hensen', 'equally', 'serious', 'career.It', 'difficult', 'categorize', 'Mighty', 'themes', 'are', 'too', 'mature', 'most', 'children', 'many', 'adults', 'do', 'not', 'movies', 'children', 'subject', 'matter', 'might', 'times', 'be', 'considered', 'grim', 'yet', 'surprising', 'amount', 'humor', 'suspect', 'one', 'films', 'will', 'become', 'cult', 'favorites', 'decade', 'so']",The Mighty

464550,A1LDIMQISH07WK,6305428247,Rebecca,"[8, 10]","I just loved THE MIGHTY. It's about a 14-year-old boy named Max Kane (Elden Ratliff) who is an outcast because of his unusual giant-like size. Max lives with his kind grandmother - his father had been put in jail several years ago. When Max starts doing poorly in school, he has to get a tutor. The tutor ends up being a 14-year-old disabled, but intelligent boy in Max's school named Kevin Dillon (Kieran Culkin). Kevin feels like an outcast because of his disabilities. At first they do not get along very well, but soon they become best friends, when they realize that they are just as strong as everybody else when they unit as one. Sharon Stone plays Kevin's kind mother, Gwen Dillon, who takes care of Kevin while Kevin's father is also in jail. Gillian Anderson (&quot;The X-Files&quot;), plays a woman named Loretta Lee, who helps Kevin and Max in the end.The only reason why people may think Sharon Stone is the main star in THE MIGHTY is because she is the most famous out of the cast. But she is only in like, a few sceens. It's Kieran Culkin and Elden Ratliff who are the REAL main stars.

464553,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,6305428247,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[1, 1]","Rodman Philbrick'sFreak The Mighty (Scholastic Signature)is the tale of learning disabled Max (Elden Hensen), the son of incarcerated murderer ""Killer"" Kane (James Gandolfini,The Sopranos: The Complete First Season) and his friendship with Kevin (Kieran Culkin), a genius with Morquio's Syndrome (Ian Michael Smith fromSimon Birchwas also considered but turned down; a pity, since he actually *has* Morquio's Syndrome). Max has lived with his grim grandparents since the time that his father murdered his mother, and leads a painful existence at school. He rarely emerges from his basement room, terrified that he's too stupid and huge, and most importantly, that he takes after his homicidal father.When Kevin moves next door, Max only wants to be invisible and is humiliated when Kevin becomes his reading tutor. But the unexpected happens: Kevin introduces Max to the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, and Max begins to harness the power of imagination. The two work out an arrangement where Max serves as Kevin's legs, and Kevin as Max's brain. The two are involved in several hair-raising adventures and flights of fancy until an unexpectedly violent event that changes both their lives. The screenplay stays fairly close to the original novel, which is a huge plus.The Mighty is a prime example of an all-star cast used to full advantage. Kieran Culkin, even though able-bodied, does an admirable job as brainiac Kevin without becoming a caricature of his disability. Harry Dean Stanton, Sharon Stone, James Gandolfini, Gillian Anderson, and Meat Loaf all put in memorable performances. Sting also contributes the obligatory theme song, topping off a soundtrack drenched in Renaissance Faire Celtic stylings.

Both learn from each other the importance of friendship and the values of honor, bravery, helping others, and accepting yourself.
