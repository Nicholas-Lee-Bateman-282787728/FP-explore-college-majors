While I wouldn't say that Tom Cruise or any of the actors for that matter gave an oscar performance, this film was interesting in the way it contrasted West and EAst.  Moreover, the film's main character Nathan Algren seems resistant to the West and its ideals as he is haunted by memories of fighting the ""Indians.""  Through his interaction with the samurai, he comes to realize the rootlessness of the West.  The West seems bent on doing, while the samurai focus on being.  It is through Algren's observations of samurai connection between mind and body that he finally rejects the West and its ways.  This film was also interesting in its rich symbolism, and of course I was glad that there was no gratuitous sex scene.

807958,A1PB2W640Z87RJ,B0001JXOUS,"Abhilash.R ""The Sagittarian""","[3, 3]","A movie with production value like The Last Samurai will never go unnoticed. Especially when it boasts some of the most recognizable names in Hollywood. But whether the movie holds good on its own or not is an altogether different issue.That job is left to us, the viewers. And The Last Samurai, albeit with some reservation, does manage to stand on its own against the likes of Dances With Wolves and Glory.The Story:The Last Samurai is about the cultural and industrial revolution Japan goes through in the late 19th century, forcing some of its most ancient institutions to crumble under the onslaught of western modernization. Meiji (Schichinosuke Nakamura), the young but rather hasty Emperor of Japan is determined to see his country stand against other industrialized nations and believes this can only happen by forgoeing the traditions that Japan held dear for nearly 2000 yrs.The first to be sidelined is the very force that was created by erstwhile Emperors and clan chiefs to protect them and Japan. The warrior swordsmen called Samurai. The Samurai (or 'to serve') is in itself a community that adheres to certain strict moral standards of living which it neither changes nor bends. The Samurai are known for their extraordinary loyalty , honour and fighting skill and there traditional sword, the 'Katana', is considered to be the finest sword in the world.The sudden change in Japan appalls the Samurai, and it is provocation enough to make them turn against there own master. Their leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) believes this resistance to be in the service of the Emperor himself; to make him understand how much the Samurai sacrificed for him and his like and for what values it stands for. However the Emperor, influenced by his coterie of corrupt officials, is unrelenting. He needs a credible force to defeat the Samurai once and for all.In comes the American connection...To support and aid the modernization of the Japanese Army, Captain Nathan Algren(Tom Cruise), a guilt-ridden, alcoholic Civil War veteran is recruited by hishis cold, ruthless and remorseless superior Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn). Landing in Japan only to find himself leading an untrained battalion of 'conscript' farmers with guns, the first battle with the enigmatic Samurai ends in total disaster, with Algren being the only man left behind. Injured and semi-conscious, Algren is held captive by the Samurai until he is fully healed. It is during this period that Algren slowly comes to respect his enemy and learns their way of life. And the community in return learns to admire his transformation.Slowly but surely, Algren understands the plight of the Samurai and joins their cause, culminating in an epic battle between modernity and honour. Swordsman vs Rifleman. The Archer vs Howitzers.The movie:There is no doubt the real strength of the movie lies in lack of any flashy effects. Zwick does well to cover even the final battle in the classic war mold without relying too much on the numbers as against realism. The settings are lavish and completely authentic. The costume design is flawless. Though the movie's story does not do justice to the factual events of Japan's history, it is nonetheless interesting. The cinematography is beautiful and the music by Hans Zimmer is exemplary, wonderfully theme oriented. The overall production value will no doubt, keep this movie in the limelight for quite a few years to come.The cast:This movie was supposed to showcase Cruise's acting talent,but it ended up being a Japanese delight. Ken Watanabe should have won the Supporting Actor Award (I'm not taking anything away from Tim Robbins though). He was really compelling, dignified and totally original. Shin Koyamada (Nobutada), Sosuke Ikematsu (Higen) as his sons are superb. However the real star of the movie is the newcomer Koyuki(Taka) as the sister of Katsumoto. She brings a rare and beautiful screen presence to the movie, not to mention her silent but wonderfully conveyed feelings towards Algren. And she is downright beautiful. The rest of the cast including Timothy Spall(Simon Graham), Tony Goldwyn(Col.Bagley), Emperor(Nakamura)and Masato Harado(Omura) does its job commendably.The downside:If ever there was any reason for this movie to be a disappointment (which it commercially was, as far as epics go), it would have to be the main protagonist himself. Though Tom Cruise is a great actor, here he is steriotypical and unconvincing.Totally predictable. Part,if not most of this fault lies with director Edward Zwick too. Zwick never really showed how Algren changes when held captive by the Samurai, the most important period of the movie. Not only that, the ending was totally cliched as Algren is left the last man standing (and always an American at that!). Hence the title of the movie becomes even more ambiguous. And this only stifles Cruise's performance and lowers his character from being a champion to a 'has been'. I personally feel Zwick should have invested some more time on Cruise's period of transformation.And oh before I forget,if you have watched Dances with Wolves, you will say that The Last Samurai is a product of pure plaigiarism. And it's true. You just cannot watch this movie without recalling the Dances With Wolves' theme with almost exacting detail. Just the setting is different. On a face-to-face basis, TLS will not beat the true originality of DwW. That is for sure.Unfortuantely the Producer and the Director themselves were resposible for this movie to reach the level of 'a good..'instead of 'a masterpiece...'.Conclusion:Luckily the movie does stand on its own. This has to do with the individual themes in the movie than as a whole. See it for the Samurai. Their way of life and honour is extremely interesting and educative. You would wonder how such a thriving culture was virtually wiped out in less than 10 yrs. The cinematography and music are the movie's other assets. The main battle scene is utterly realistic and in the end, poignant.At over 21/2 hrs, the movie has a laid back feel to it that will ultimately give you your money's worth. Definitely go watch it.",4,A cinematic but flawed epic....,1086912000,"06 11, 2004",2004,6134,"['movie', 'production', 'value', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'will', 'never', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'Especially',

807959,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B0001JXOUS,A. Burchfield,"[2, 3]","I missed seeing The Last Samurai in the theatre but decided to buy a copy anyway because it looked good in the ads and the write-ups I'd read.Tom Cruise plays the role of Captain Nathan Algren, former Indian fighter in the U.S. Army (bits of this are shown in flashbacks)now a pathetic drunken loser reduced to giving sales demonstrations of Winchester rifles.He's contacted by a former associate and takes on the job of instructing the newly formed Japanese Imperial Army. The story is set in 1876 or so at a time of great change in Japan, the forces of modernization fast pacing Japan into the modern age. Part of this mission involves rooting out the last Samurai holdouts. Algren leads his recruits into battle, his recruits are massacred and after a valiant fight he is captured by the very man he is supposed to deal with. Taken to the Samurai village as a prisoner Algren gradually learns their ways, even learns to respect them. Algren eventually, after failing to reintegrate with his own people (and the dishonorable Japanese modernizers who I wanted to see get killed),joins with the Samurai in a battle to the death with the new Imperial Army. This is of course a slaughter with swords & spears against rifles & Gatling guns. The Imperial soldiers are so shamed by what they've done that they refuse an order to kill Algren and the Emperor strips the chief ""New Japan"" leader of everything he has.You never really learn what happens to Algren, it seems he goes back to the stronghold and the lead Samurai's widow, but that is presented as maybe he did, who knows?I thought the story was interesting, Cruise did a good job, but something was lacking- I'm not sure what. The costumes/ weapons were great, most of the sets/ locations were too ( a real sense of being in Japan)I just needed something more. Some of the extras are very interesting, I liked learning about how things were built or designed.

Set in 19th century Japan a single group of samurai is all that is left of a once fearsome and noble tradition, and Tom Cruise ends up staying with them. I do not want to say much more about the story, unlike some other reviewers, because it is impossible to tell as well as the film does. I will just say that this epic and beautfully written tale leaves you with a whole new respect for what samurais have done for the legend of Japan.Tom Cruise is simply phenomenal! This is his best performance on the silver screen by far. Also, his co-star Ken Watanabe who plays the leader of the samurai is better than your highest expectaions. As for the fighting, there are many great scenes that range from sword training to being raided by ninjas to the final bloody battle that can stand up to any other ever filmed.  Speaking of blood, the special effects are outstanding and the sound is excellent, they really bring the action to life.

You can see why Tom Cruise follows him into his ways. This film is directed very well by the underrated Edward Zwick and Tom Cruise gives a very good performance.

Beverly""","[3, 6]","The production on this film was very well done, the battle scenes were great and the hand to hand fighting (although a small part of the film) reminded me of some of the better kung fu type action flicks I remembered as a kid.  The acting was decent although I think I'm getting a little tired of Tom Cruise.I wish the film had gone more into the relationship between the American and his Japanese host (the woman that tended to him when he finds himself captive in a remote village) because I thought there was some decent on screen chemistry there.  In any case, the movie was mostly an action/adventure/war flick, so I can't complain too loudly.Now as for the slanted history and the obvious anti-American sentiment, it's funny, when I think about a book I just read and reviewed here.  In Alan Colmes' book on liberalism he talks about how liberals are better because they are progressive and being progressive and moving foward are better qualities and it is the ""better"" people that think progress.  However, it's ironic that the left seems to always be against America, or conservatives at least, wanting to bring ""progress"" to other places.  It seems that here in America, things like equal rights for woman should be the law of the land, but in backward places, where it's ""just the custom"" that those rights don't exist, America shouldn't interfere.I bring the topic up because in this flick the ideal of being a Samurai is so romanticized and the ideal of Americanism is so bashed that it takes away any kind of serious nature the film might have had in an historical sense.  It isn't that America (or better said) Americans haven't  committed all kinds of horrible sins, it's just that so has everyone else on this plant and to deny that is foolhardy.If you can look past some of the silliness of the film, like an American solider going to Japan in 1876 and learning the language in a few months, while recovering from near fatal war wounds, while falling in love, while learning the martial arts, while recovering from alcoholism and at the same time earning the love and respect of the villagers including some that suffered the loss of loved ones at his hands, then you can probably just enjoy the movie as an action flick, as I did.",3,Entertaining,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,2249,"['production', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'great', 'hand', 'hand', 'fighting', 'small', 'part', 'film', 'reminded', 'better', 'kung', 'fu', 'type', 'action', 'flicks', 'remembered', 'kid', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'think', ""'m"", 'getting', 'little', 'tired', 'Tom', 'Cruise.I', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'gone', 'more', 'relationship', 'American', 'Japanese', 'host', 'woman', 'tended', 'when', 'captive', 'remote', 'village', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'there', 'case', 'movie', 'was', 'mostly', 'action/adventure/war', 'flick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'loudly.Now', 'slanted', 'history', 'obvious', 'anti-American', 'sentiment', 'funny', 'when', 'think', 'book', 'just', 'read', 'reviewed', 'here', 'Alan', 'Colmes', 'book', 'liberalism', 'how', 'liberals', 'are', 'better', 'are', 'progressive', 'being', 'progressive', 'moving', 'foward', 'are', 'better', 'qualities', 'better', 'people', 'think', 'progress', 'However', 'ironic', 'left', 'always', 'be', 'America', 'conservatives', 'least', 'wanting', 'bring', 'progress', 'other', 'places', 'here', 'America', 'things', 'equal', 'rights', 'woman', 'should', 'be', 'law', 'land', 'backward', 'places', 'where', 'just', 'custom', 'rights', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'America', 'should', ""n't"", 'interfere.I', 'bring', 'topic', 'up', 'flick', 'ideal', 'being', 'Samurai', 'so', 'romanticized', 'ideal', 'Americanism', 'so', 'bashed', 'away', 'kind', 'serious', 'nature', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'historical', 'sense', ""n't"", 'America', 'better', 'said', 'Americans', 'have', ""n't"", 'committed', 'kinds', 'horrible', 'sins', 'just', 'so', 'everyone', 'else', 'plant', 'deny', 'foolhardy.If', 'can', 'look', 'past', 'silliness', 'film', 'American', 'solider', 'going', 'Japan', '1876', 'learning', 'language', 'few', 'months', 'recovering', 'fatal', 'war', 'wounds', 'falling', 'love', 'learning', 'martial', 'arts', 'recovering', 'alcoholism', 'same', 'time', 'earning', 'love', 'respect', 'villagers', 'including', 'suffered', 'loss', 'loved', 'ones', 'hands', 'then', 'can', 'probably', 'just', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'action', 'flick', 'did']",N/A

One, there aren't any clear protagonists.  Two the characters the movie centers on don't necessarily win.  Three, Tom Cruise stars.The director of this movie is best known for directing the classic Civil War epic Glory.  This movie shows a lot of similar aspects of Glory.Tom Cruise who is a former hero from the Civil War is now broken and destitute.  His past haunts him and he can't seem to find any sort of life outside the millitary.  His character was involved in forcing Native Americans out of lands desired by the American government.  In other words killing any that didn't leave voluntarily.  So he has nightmares of being ordered to kill women and children.  Winchester pays him to do performances telling the values of their rifles, but even they are losing patience with him.  His alcoholism and depression have made him next to impossible to work with.He is then looked up by a man he used to serve with who has a business proposition.  Japan has decided to modernize their society to keep pace with the times.  So they are hiring people from all over the world to help them out.  Most notably ""warriors"" from the United States.He is sent to Japan and starts to teach their ""soldiers"", which are conscripts, main farmers who'd never fired a rifle in their lives.  When their leaders inform him of an opponent the the modernization, a samurai that opposes the new ways.  He is told he needs to take his army into battle, their superior weapons will help ensure victory.  He warns them that it is a bad idea to take green soliders into a battle with combat veterans this early despite their superior weapons.His fears prove justified, the soliders are too frightened to follow orders or even keep rank.  The Samurai rush in and quickly defeat his forces.  He is kept alive because the samurai leader, Katsumoto, is interested in this fierce fighter, and wants to learn of his enemy.  So the Samurai reluctantly let him live and take him into the mountains where he is trapped there by the winter.This was a well acted, well shot, and engaging.  Some people complain that the plot has been done before, but what plots haven't?  The Lion King followed the story of Hamlet, Resevoir Dogs was about 60% of a hong kong movie ""city on fire"", and Kill Bill is a mix of every major hong kong and japanese action cinema in existence.  The important part is how it is carried out.This movie has well choreographed action sequences.  Though they were a little inaccurate towards the end on what was known and what they did, it was a minor detail.The main characters weren't the heroes you would expect them to be.  They humanized so that you relate with them, but are still their own people.  There is a discussion where they talk of Custer's last stand, one that we look at with embarassment.  Katsumoto on the other hand is impressed with their bravery and thinks they died a good death.  Dying in combat against incredible odds was not only brave to him, but honorable.  Didn't matter the reasons, Samurai didn't believe in right or wrong, only duty.Tom Cruise wasn't that bad, he has matured since Risky Business.  He isn't at the level of Sean Connery or George Clooney, but he is competent and believable in this role.  Which interestingly enough is very close to the Union general Grant, an alcoholic that seemed to be only fit for war.  Only Cruise's character was only a low level officer, not a general.All in all this is a well made and entertaining film.  There should be elements for all types, so it would be a good date movie.  Action to keep guys interested, and complicated romantic elements that will entertain the women.  It doesn't reach the same levels as Gladiator or Braveheart, but it is worth the price of admission.

807976,A1GQ7AFCN7OZMK,B0001JXOUS,amster,"[6, 11]","I'm a big fan a Japanese period movies.  In all those films, whether they are ""high"" art like Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samurai"" and ""Ran"", or ""low"" art like ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" or ""Zatoichi"", one of the prevailing themes is the inherent hypocrisy and injustice embedded in the feudal society of old Japan.  How the characters manage to get by in this oppressive society is almost always a source, if not the primary source, of the drama in the story line.  Japanese filmakers know this.  They know that ancient Japan, while admirable in many respects, was not a eutopia by any stretch of the imagination.  Women were property.  Peasants were considered sub-human.

He is a Captain in the U.S. Army who is so ashamed of the things he did in the Indian Wars under Gen. Custer that he has to constantly drink in order to forget the extremely painful memories.  Unable to keep a job, he decides to accept an offer from a Japanese noble-man.  Along with a few other military officers, including his old Colonel (Tony Goldwyn), whom Algren detests for ordering him to carry out viscious orders, and Algren's friend Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly), he will travel to Japan to train the imperial army in modern warfare.  Japan is trying to modernize after centuries of isolationism, and there is a rebellion led by the Samurai, who believe that by modernizing, Japan is losing its sense of self.  The Samurai, led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), will do everything they can to protect the traditional Japanese values.After the first battle, the poorly trained Imperial Army is massacred by the disciplined Samurai warriors, and Algren is the only soldier able to actually defend himself.  Sensing his strength, Katsumoto has him taken alive in order to be studied.  While in Katsumoto's village, Algren begins to discover many admirable qualities of the Samurai, including their discipline, their loyalty, and most importantly for Algren, their serenity.This was a great film; it dealt with loyalty, moral ambiguity, and courage.

However...It is basically a rehash of Dances with Wolves (check out the Samurai village and the Native American references): unhappy, unsatisfied white guy finds himself in an exotic (to him) culture and, much to his surprise and everyone else's, he finds his salvation there and goes native.  Not only does he find his salvation there but he becomes their savior against the white people who are corrupting such an idyllic culture.  Apparently, the world needs more white guys to save them (and everyone else) from themselves.I suppose, in this day and age, American history is being rewritten and our guilty consciences of our ignorance of other cultures leads us to make movies such as this one.  We have misunderstood other cultures for far too long and it is up to the American film industry to make American movies to help Americans understood how wrong Americans have been!The pretense is that this movie is meant to honor the Samurai.  We see the serenity of the idyllic life of the Samurai, the happy children, the Buddhist chants and all that other stuff that falls just short of stereotyping.  It feels as if someone studied the Samurai in books (and old Samurai movies) and wrote a movie about it, trying to give it a twist.  But it all centers around Tom Cruise.  The Samurai in the end are pretty much props.  In the end it feels a bit, well, pretentious.  And predictable.The action scenes are fun to watch (though Kill Bill's got this one beat) and fantasize a bit about such an idyllic life.  But it's been taken just a bit too serious.

So I will be brief:This is a film for all those (and judging by my reading of Amazon reviews: they are legion) who loathe America and love a romanticized and fictitious culture peopled with wise and far nobler folks than we crass capitalists.  It is a false, pernicious, and short-sighted view of the world, history and the achievements and failings of human beings everywhere.  But it has a vast and gullible audience that eats it up. So, indulge yourselves once more.Every culture and all people everywhere have their glories, delights, and their failings and shames.  God knows that is as true of Japanese history and culture as well as it is of American! The film deplores American cruelty and completely overlooks the cruelty inherent in the Bushido code and what it  meant to the peoples conquered by the Japanese.  This is not only biased, it is downright dishonest.But, I make too much of what is typical Hollywood romanticized pap!

Japanese culture is almost impossible to understand to the western mindset. Feudal Japanese culture is even more difficult. Even though director Edward Zwick does a good job watering most of it down for western audiences, that's just another part of the problem. Now not only do we have a society that doesn't make sense, but now the why's and what-for's are brushed over. One example is the obligatory seppuku (ritual suicide) scene. It was a part of samurai culture, so it is shown, but western audiences are expected just to accept that samurai kill themselves when shamed, and then move on. Fans of samurai lore will be disappointed at this very shallow look into the culture and society.However, one must remember that this is a 2 1/2-hour film and not a 9 1/2-hour mini-series like Shogun. Zwick makes a smart decision to focus on the story while walking the delicate middle ground of the setting and characters. Even so, the story feels a bit rushed at points, and Cruise turns into a samurai much too quickly. But if we suspend out disbelief just a little, what we get is a mesmerizing, and powerful story about a man who reminds the Japanese of who they are.Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren; a washed up, frontier war hero who's committed so much murder and atrocity that he's lost his soul and who's only friend is the bottle. He's hired by the Japanese to train their army in the way of modern gunpowder warfare. When he arrives to Japan, he soon realizes that the Japanese want to use him to erradicate enemy samurai just as his own government used him to erradicate indians.Ken Watanabe plays Katsumoto; the samurai lord who captures Algren so that he may understand this new enemy and way of warfare he is up against. However, he and Algren form a bond of friendship, and Algren is forever changed by it.All the acting performances in this film are top notch, and I wouldn't be surprised if Watanabe was nominated for an Oscar. Cruise gives a convincing performance of the transformation from a broken man who cares about nothing to someone who cares so much for these foreign people that he's willing to die for them. The only problem with Cruise is his ""stardom."" He's such a huge mega-star that it's often impossible to forget you are watching Tom Cruise dressed up as a samurai, which is more than a little distracting.The Last Samurai is a breathtakingly beautiful film that is sure to land cinematography nominations. When the Japanese conscripts armed with muskets face down a charge of mounted samurai you will feal their fear. Kurosawa would be proud.While the story is not perfect, and we are forced to endure a few cheesy moments of Algren, it is undeniably powerful and moving.

The scenes of rural Japan were gorgeous. I was particulalrly impressed with the recreation of the Japanese harbor circa 1876 with a bustling Japanese port and a majestic mount fuji looming in the distance.The actors were all particularly great, especially Ken Watanabe who plays the rebelious(?)samurai Katsumoto. His presence on screen was commanding and his ability to be stern and understanding really worked. You cant help but feel for the inner turmoil his character endures.Overall ""the last samurai"" was a fantastic film with great acting and some great imagery.

Chow,"[14, 20]","There are some films that are so obvious and heavy-handed in their political correctness that even if one agrees with the sentiments expressed, one must hold ones nose to do so. ""The Last Samurai"" is a fine example of regard for another culture taken to such a superficial extreme that the result is smelly cardboard.I suppose that a big budget film starring one of Hollywood's most self-important egos must adhere to the ugly-American-meets-epiphany-and-goes-native formula, but will one of these unctuous tomes please depart from formula long enough to at least follow through on its own logic?This film is hypocritical in avowing its respect for Japanese culture. At least Kevin Costner created a coherent world in ""Dances With Wolves"". His Union soldier was largely an observer of the events of his time, and when he eventually left the Sioux nation, he had not single-handedly saved them from destruction or awakened them to their ancestral precepts. In ""The Last Samurai"", not only does the white hero receive an oriental spiritual transplant; he actually becomes the saviour of Japan. C'mon--gimme a break.The Meiji Emperor was not a timid little weakling just waiting for the redeemed American to give him backbone and remind him of the wisdom residing within his own culture. And even if we were to suspend all disbelief and accept that the last surviving soldier on a particularly horrific battlefield should turn out to be our unlikely hero, it surpasses even the crudest naivety that the adversaries he has just decimated would throw down their arms and pay homage to him as the last samurai. That scene left a foul taste in my mouth.Had this film truly honoured Japanese culture with the respect it professes to feel, the white hero would have died or at least turned out to be less than God's gift to Japan. Even Lawrence of Arabia ultimately failed to create his Pan-Arab nation, and that film could teach this one a lesson or two in how sensitively such themes need to be handled.This film is not an abject failure. The performances by Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada are superb and they do wonders within its shallow arc. Even Tom Cruise puts aside his most egregious excesses and serves up a passably sympathetic character. But even good performances cannot save this film from the consequences of its presumption. This is a do-gooder film that will go down well with historical revisionists and Champagne liberals who simply have to feel bad about the imperialist bits in America's past while congratulating themselves on how enlightened they are.

Faced with a fight, he closes his eyes and plays what he feels is going to happen in his head. Then, his Spidey-samurai senses in flux, he proceeds to slice and dice his enemies. The whole thing struck me as, to be honest, sorta amusing.I mean, Tom Cruise's character, Nathan Allgren, is abducted by the ancient warriors early in the film, then he spends three to six months with them, first as their enemy and then as their friend. He's living in the house of a man he killed, tended to by that man's widow. The man's children, all rather understanding about their father's death being part of ""samurai duty,"" start playing with the American, thinking him a pretty cool guy. And, while all this is happening, Nathan Allgren becomes a FEARSOME SAMURAI WARRIOR. And, eventually, he's able to battle alongside the samurai general against a band of the emperor's invading ninjas. All this in less than six months!That said, THE LAST SAMURAI is an entertaining, beautiful-looking film. Tom Cruise's character, who alternates between being a rude, drunken Civil War soldier and the sort of man who writes that he's ""beset by the irony of his life"" in his journals, is hard to pin down. But the supporting actors, particularly Ken Watanabe as the samurai general Katsumoto, are uniformly terrific in it, and they make Cruise look better and less wooden in each progressing scene.The film even, for the most part, escapes being a cliche about the white hero coming in and saving ""savage, foreign"" warriors from themselves.The ending is a letdown, sadly. This film would clearly work best as a tragedy, yet the filmmakers, for some reason, tack on a happy-ish ending to the film. By not daring to bring the story to its more obvious yet ultimately dark conclusion, the filmmakers instead give us a film that is less than great.But it's fun, for the most part. It's not going to win an Oscar, except maybe for Watanabe's supporting work, but it's a fun film.",4,Tom Cruise goes all superhero samurai.,1071100800,"12 11, 2003",2003,2055,"['favorite', 'moments', 'LAST', 'SAMURAI', 'happened', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'integration', 'samurai', 'society', 'Faced', 'fight', 'eyes', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'head', 'Then', 'Spidey-samurai', 'senses', 'flux', 'slice', 'dice', 'enemies', 'whole', 'thing', 'struck', 'be', 'honest', 'sorta', 'amusing.I', 'mean', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'Nathan', 'Allgren', 'abducted', 'ancient', 'warriors', 'early', 'film', 'then', 'three', 'six', 'months', 'first', 'enemy', 'then', 'friend', 'living', 'house', 'man', 'killed', 'tended', 'man', 'widow', 'man', 'children', 'rather', 'understanding', 'father', 'death', 'being', 'part', 'samurai', 'duty', 'playing', 'American', 'thinking', 'pretty', 'cool', 'guy', 'happening', 'Nathan', 'Allgren', 'FEARSOME', 'SAMURAI', 'WARRIOR', 'eventually', 'able', 'battle', 'samurai', 'general', 'band', 'emperor', 'invading', 'ninjas', 'less', 'six', 'months', 'said', 'LAST', 'SAMURAI', 'entertaining', 'beautiful-looking', 'film', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'who', 'being', 'rude', 'drunken', 'Civil', 'War', 'soldier', 'sort', 'man', 'who', 'beset', 'irony', 'life', 'journals', 'hard', 'pin', 'down', 'supporting', 'actors', 'particularly', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'samurai', 'general', 'Katsumoto', 'are', 'uniformly', 'terrific', 'make', 'Cruise', 'look', 'better', 'less', 'wooden', 'progressing', 'scene.The', 'film', 'even', 'most', 'part', 'being', 'cliche', 'white', 'hero', 'coming', 'saving', 'savage', 'foreign', 'warriors', 'themselves.The', 'ending', 'letdown', 'sadly', 'film', 'would', 'clearly', 'work', 'best', 'tragedy', 'yet', 'filmmakers', 'reason', 'tack', 'happy-ish', 'ending', 'film', 'not', 'daring', 'bring', 'story', 'more', 'obvious', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'dark', 'conclusion', 'filmmakers', 'instead', 'give', 'film', 'less', 'great.But', 'fun', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'going', 'win', 'Oscar', 'maybe', 'Watanabe', 'supporting', 'work', 'fun', 'film']",N/A

808002,AG5XM49AZVIYH,B0001JXOUS,"Ben ""Pizza Enthusiast""","[2, 2]","The Last Samurai is an outstanding film that tells the fictional story of Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise), a soldier haunted by regrets hired to train raw Japanese recruits to fight the Samurai, and Samurai leader Katsumoto (Watanabe), who is leading a rebellion in Japan against those who he believes are westernizing the country too quickly. Algren ends up becoming a prisoner of the Samurai, but after spending a number of months as their captive, subsequently finds peace in their way of life. Eventually, he joins forces with the men he was hired to fight against.Not only is the plot interesting and original, but the performances of the actors are nothing short of amazing. Tom Cruise puts forth an outstanding effort, which I consider his best ever. Ken Watanabe is perfect as Katsumoto, commanding even more attention than Cruise, and all of the secondary characters are equally convincing in their roles. Some of the highlights include Koyuki as Taka, Hiroyuki Sanada as Ujio, and Timothy Spall as Simon Graham.The execution of the battle scenes was excellent. This can be attributed to a cast full of professional sword-fighters as extras and Cruise and Watanabe doing all their own stunts. As seen in the extras, the progression of Cruise's skills with a sword isn't staged, either. Sanada and others spent hours working with him every day until he could handle a blade with precision.Having seen this film a dozen times, I can also say I honestly am not able to find many mistakes in the filming and editing, either. The ones I have noticed are hidden well, and none of them take away from the film in any way. There are a few lines in the script that come across as slightly bland or predictable, but overall the script is very well written. Tom Cruise actually speaks Japanese in a handful of scenes, and he does it well.What really makes the movie, on top of everything else, is the beautiful score composed by Hans Zimmer. Though he often recycles his scores and changes them very little, this one is unique and powerful.The Last Samurai's historical accuracy isn't as poor as some reviewers would suggest, but it is a work of fiction. On the special edition of this DVD, 2 deleted scenes are included, along with ""the filming of"" one of the scenes, and ""the filming of"" the Cruise beheading scene. There is also a handful of interviews and a look at the real history of the decline of the Samurai in Japan.All in all, The Last Samurai is an extremely entertaining and convincing film. The special edition of this DVD is well worth the extra few dollars, and it has become one of my all time favorite movies.",5,Tom Cruise's best.,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,2624,"['Last', 'Samurai', 'outstanding', 'film', 'fictional', 'story', 'Captain', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'Cruise', 'soldier', 'haunted', 'regrets', 'hired', 'train', 'raw', 'Japanese', 'recruits', 'fight', 'Samurai', 'Samurai', 'leader', 'Katsumoto', 'Watanabe', 'who', 'leading', 'rebellion', 'Japan', 'who', 'are', 'westernizing', 'country', 'too', 'quickly', 'Algren', 'up', 'becoming', 'prisoner', 'Samurai', 'spending', 'number', 'months', 'captive', 'subsequently', 'peace', 'way', 'life', 'Eventually', 'forces', 'men', 'was', 'hired', 'fight', 'against.Not', 'only', 'plot', 'interesting', 'original', 'performances', 'actors', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'forth', 'outstanding', 'effort', 'consider', 'best', 'ever', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'perfect', 'Katsumoto', 'commanding', 'even', 'more', 'attention', 'Cruise', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'equally', 'convincing', 'roles', 'highlights', 'include', 'Koyuki', 'Taka', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'Ujio', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Simon', 'Graham.The', 'execution', 'battle', 'scenes', 'was', 'excellent', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'cast', 'full', 'professional', 'sword-fighters', 'extras', 'Cruise', 'Watanabe', 'doing', 'own', 'stunts', 'seen', 'extras', 'progression', 'Cruise', 'skills', 'sword', ""n't"", 'staged', 'Sanada', 'others', 'spent', 'hours', 'working', 'day', 'could', 'handle', 'blade', 'precision.Having', 'seen', 'film', 'dozen', 'times', 'can', 'also', 'say', 'honestly', 'am', 'not', 'able', 'find', 'many', 'mistakes', 'filming', 'editing', 'either', 'ones', 'have', 'noticed', 'are', 'hidden', 'well', 'none', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'way', 'are', 'few', 'lines', 'script', 'come', 'slightly', 'bland', 'predictable', 'script', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'actually', 'Japanese', 'handful', 'scenes', 'really', 'movie', 'top', 'everything', 'else', 'beautiful', 'score', 'composed', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'often', 'scores', 'changes', 'very', 'little', 'one', 'unique', 'powerful.The', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'historical', 'accuracy', ""n't"", 'as', 'poor', 'reviewers', 'would', 'suggest', 'work', 'fiction', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', '2', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'filming', 'one', 'scenes', 'filming', 'Cruise', 'beheading', 'scene', 'also', 'handful', 'interviews', 'look', 'real', 'history', 'decline', 'Samurai', 'Japan.All', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'convincing', 'film', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'well', 'extra', 'few', 'dollars', 'become', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'movies']",N/A

808008,A3AF8P0GINFADV,B0001JXOUS,Black Barbie,"[237, 276]","It's 1876. Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has been sent to Japan in order to help the Imperial Japanese Army become more 'modern' and less 'traditional' and ultimately prepare them to fight the legendary Samurai. Events occur that cause Tom Cruise to be a captive of the deadly but extremely polite Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) who is the leader of the Japanese Samurai. At this point, the viewer begins to learn why the Samurai are fighting to preserve their way of life against Western influences and Cruise's character becomes emotionally bound to them and he integrates himself into their society after working hard to earn their trust. However, the film is not solely about the struggle for the Samurai to keep their way of life, another subplot includes the low key and shy love relationship between Algren and Taka, a quiet widow (played with subtlety by Koyuki). Though it isn't a big part in the film, it highlights the emotional aspect of the film and shows that this is not a film about swords.Positive Points:In my view, Cruise has been a decent actor with fluctuating performances but in this current effort, he has shown that he is improving and learning how to adapt to different styles of acting. He plays the tormented captain with surprising intelligence and conviction. I was very impressed to see him speaking Japanese - I loved the way this film mixed both English and Japanese toghether because it gave it a strong edge. However, The real star of this film is Ken Watanabe (Tom who?). He played Katsumoto with such a commanding and intense presence that it was hard to concentrate on Cruise or any other actor in the film. Without doubt deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.Special mention should go to Koyuki and Ujio (played by Hiroyuki Sanada). As supporting roles, they both acted convincingly without saying much but succeeded in showing that there are many more interesting characters besides Algren and Katsumoto.Great music score by Hans Zimmer and fantastic costume design that will not doubt trigger a trend in Samurai-influenced clothes.Negative points: While the film was entertaining, it focused too much on Cruise. The supporting characters were great too and people like Taka and Ujio should have had more developed personalities.What is Billy Connolly doing in this film? A Scottish man impersonating an Irish man?

Just look at the protagonists in his films, striving for independence, justice and honor: Denzel Washington's characters in 'Courage Under Fire' and 'The Siege', or Matt Broderick in 'Glory'. Tom Cruise, as it turns out, represents the director's patriotism like no other - just watch the sulken way he looks past the camera while riding a horse, battling, or simply conversing with the samurai, who took him hostage to see learn the Americans' techniques. This is a star performance, and never for a second is Tom anyone but Tom - he simply looks more and more ridiculous in different costumes, but with the same facial expression of deep pondering.The film is like its star's performance: while glossy and seemingly intelligent, it's in fact shallow and predictable. The film follows a simple structure: Cruise as American - Cruise captured by samurai - Cruise trains - Cruise falls in love with the village and its people (including the wife of a man he killed) - Cruise as samurai. Ken Watanabe is a very Americanized samurai; Cruise's love interest actually fits him in terms of the acting range she displays (tragism has never been so unflichingly boring). And at the end, there is this unimpressive, 'bad version of LOTR' battle, where the two protagonists remain alive just to pronounce the moral of the film.Zwick's film isn't apparently flawed, but doesn't break any new ground. It displays little affection/understanding of its main subject.

I didn't know how deep it would try and be, or how good the storyline or action was. I may hear people complain about a few plot holes, but give the movie a break, guys. This is definitely one of Tom Cruise's best outings. One of his most emotional performances is given here. Ken Watanabe is astounding as the leader of the samurai clan that take Civil War vet Capt. Nathan Aulgren (Cruise) into their clan as a P.O.V. but he eventually learns to like their culture and becomes a samurai himself. The landscape of the movie is beautiful, and Hans Zimmer's score plays gloriously in the background.The movie really makes you eventually hate the &quot;modern&quot; enemy of a modernized Japan, with a fully-equipped legion of American-trained soldiers, Nathan's old enemy from back home, and the leader of the new brand of soldiers. This leads to an all-out war between the samurai and the new Japan and it is an incredible scene when these two go at it, definitely one of my favorite movie war scenes of all-time.The DVD is a fully-loaded 2 disc-set, boasting impressive video quality and audio quality on the first one with 2.35:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack (I would've liked a DTS though), and impressive special features on the second disc that further immerse you in the world of old Japan.Definitely a very powerful, albeit a bit fictitious, film.

This movie is what results when a director with left-leaning sensibilities tries to make a liberal-minded ""message"" movie without the courage of his own convictions. So the movie is not content to merely show us the crisis facing the Samurai in the face of westernization and letting our sympathies lie with them....Oh no, fearful that an American audience would not take to a film centered around Japanese characters, we have to have a white, hot-shot Hollywood actor to root for, who sweeps in to be our hero. We get a token Japanese hero to root for as well, but guess who remains living at the end of the film?Didn't Kevin Costner already make this movie?  Tom Cruise's heart is obviously in the right place. He gives an incredibly earnest performance...and that's part of the problem. He's SO earnest that I never forgot for a second that I was watching Tom Cruise, Mr. Hollywood A-List, feeling self-important for attaching himself to such an important film.  Ken Watanabe received heaps of praise for his performance, but I fail to see what the hype is about. And the obligatory love story is just silly---obviously, the movie makers thought so too, because they make only a half-hearted attempt to develop it in the first place.I loved the message in ""The Last Samurai,"" but I hated the approach taken to the material.  It's yet one more movie in which the creators give the audience not one single amount of credit for having a brain; emotions are force-fed to us through superficial means like slow-motion and thundering music.  Not comfortable with any amount of ambiguity, all of the Americans except for Tom Cruise have to be evil, and all of the Samurai have to be entirely noble. The film inadvertently makes the point that killing someone with a sword or a bow and arrow makes you a better person than killing someone with a gun, conveniently sidestepping the fact that killing is killing, regardless of how it's done.My summary: a pretty film with not a brain in its head.Grade: C-",2,A Good Movie Turned Bad,1085702400,"05 28, 2004",2004,2137,"['***Some', 'Spoilers****How', 'disappointing', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'dreadful', 'last', 'half', 'first', 'half', 'quite', 'engaging', 'movie', 'what', 'results', 'when', 'director', 'left-leaning', 'sensibilities', 'make', 'liberal-minded', 'message', 'movie', 'courage', 'own', 'convictions', 'movie', 'not', 'content', 'merely', 'show', 'crisis', 'facing', 'Samurai', 'face', 'westernization', 'letting', 'sympathies', 'lie', 'American', 'audience', 'would', 'not', 'take', 'film', 'centered', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'have', 'have', 'white', 'hot-shot', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'root', 'who', 'be', 'hero', 'get', 'token', 'Japanese', 'hero', 'root', 'as', 'well', 'guess', 'who', 'living', 'end', 'film', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'already', 'make', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'heart', 'obviously', 'right', 'place', 'incredibly', 'earnest', 'performance', 'part', 'problem', 'SO', 'earnest', 'never', 'forgot', 'second', 'was', 'watching', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Mr.', 'Hollywood', 'A-List', 'feeling', 'self-important', 'attaching', 'important', 'film', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'received', 'heaps', 'praise', 'performance', 'fail', 'see', 'what', 'hype', 'obligatory', 'love', 'story', 'just', 'silly', '-obviously', 'movie', 'makers', 'thought', 'so', 'too', 'make', 'only', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'develop', 'first', 'place.I', 'loved', 'message', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'hated', 'approach', 'taken', 'material', 'yet', 'one', 'more', 'movie', 'creators', 'give', 'audience', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'amount', 'credit', 'having', 'brain', 'emotions', 'are', 'force-fed', 'superficial', 'means', 'slow-motion', 'thundering', 'music', 'Not', 'comfortable', 'amount', 'ambiguity', 'Americans', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'have', 'be', 'evil', 'Samurai', 'have', 'be', 'entirely', 'noble', 'film', 'inadvertently', 'point', 'killing', 'someone', 'sword', 'bow', 'arrow', 'better', 'person', 'killing', 'someone', 'gun', 'conveniently', 'sidestepping', 'fact', 'killing', 'killing', 'regardless', 'how', 'done.My', 'summary', 'pretty', 'film', 'not', 'brain', 'head.Grade', 'C-']",N/A

He is nursed back to health after a battle wound by the family of the man he killed and he goes through several flashbacks of the battles with Native Americans he seems to wonder if it was the right thing or not.

Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[8, 10]","""The Last Samurai"" is a breathtaking, historical, panorama that examines the blending of cultures and the clash of competing value systems. In this film, Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren a twelve year old boy who has moved from New Jersey to the California Coast with his single mom. While adjusting to his new environment, Algren practices Bushido (the way of the warrior) from an instruction book and from a few introductory classes that he learned at the local YMCA in his hometown.He also befriends a local girl who, unfortunately is hounded by her ex-boyfriend, an arrogant and aggressive teenager who cruises around town with his friend on dirt bikes. When the ex-boyfriend catches Algren and the girl together a fight ensues and Algren is beaten and humiliated. This prompts Algren to go to the local Bushido dojo where unfortunately he discovers that the ex-boyfriend is the star pupil and the instructor is a sadist.Fortunately, Algren meets Mr. Miyagi an old Samurai warrior who works as a handyman in Algren's rental unit. When Mr. Miyagi realizes Algren's dilemma he takes him on as his lone pupil and teaches him the way of Bushido. Mr. Miyagi orders Algren to paint his fence, wax his car, and strike girlie-man poses on a post by the sea shore all the while promising that this will teach him how to wield a Katana like no other Caucasian man has ever done before.And somehow it works. All of Mr. Miyagi's household chores turn out to be magic Samurai conditioning techniques that convert Algren into the Unstoppable White Warrior (UWW). From here an epic battle takes place between Algren and the ex boyfriend and his evil cohorts. I won't give away the outcome of this incredible battle scene except to say that Cruise does a lot of grunting, his eyes puff out during some of the more visceral moments of combat and his beard flutters in the wind like the calm of the butterfly.",5,The Samurai Kid,1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,1893,"['Last', 'Samurai', 'breathtaking', 'historical', 'panorama', 'blending', 'cultures', 'clash', 'competing', 'value', 'systems', 'film', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'moved', 'New', 'Jersey', 'California', 'Coast', 'single', 'mom', 'adjusting', 'new', 'environment', 'Algren', 'practices', 'Bushido', 'way', 'warrior', 'instruction', 'book', 'few', 'introductory', 'classes', 'learned', 'local', 'YMCA', 'hometown.He', 'also', 'local', 'girl', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'hounded', 'ex-boyfriend', 'arrogant', 'aggressive', 'teenager', 'who', 'town', 'friend', 'dirt', 'bikes', 'When', 'ex-boyfriend', 'catches', 'Algren', 'girl', 'together', 'fight', 'ensues', 'Algren', 'beaten', 'humiliated', 'Algren', 'go', 'local', 'Bushido', 'dojo', 'where', 'unfortunately', 'ex-boyfriend', 'star', 'pupil', 'instructor', 'sadist.Fortunately', 'Algren', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'old', 'Samurai', 'warrior', 'who', 'handyman', 'Algren', 'rental', 'unit', 'When', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'Algren', 'dilemma', 'lone', 'pupil', 'way', 'Bushido', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'orders', 'Algren', 'paint', 'fence', 'wax', 'car', 'strike', 'girlie-man', 'poses', 'post', 'sea', 'shore', 'while', 'promising', 'will', 'teach', 'how', 'wield', 'Katana', 'other', 'Caucasian', 'man', 'ever', 'done', 'before.And', 'somehow', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'household', 'chores', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'magic', 'Samurai', 'conditioning', 'techniques', 'convert', 'Algren', 'Unstoppable', 'White', 'Warrior', 'UWW', 'here', 'epic', 'battle', 'place', 'Algren', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'evil', 'cohorts', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'outcome', 'incredible', 'battle', 'scene', 'say', 'Cruise', 'lot', 'grunting', 'eyes', 'puff', 'out', 'more', 'visceral', 'moments', 'combat', 'beard', 'flutters', 'wind', 'calm', 'butterfly']",N/A

It's 1876, bare months after Custer's Last Stand, and Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a survivor of the Seventh Cavalry, is working as a huckster for the Winchester rifle company and doing his best to drown himself in drink.  Like Frank Hopkins ofHidalgo (Widescreen Edition), he's tormented by memories of an attack on a camp of peaceable Indians--and quite ready to kill the C.O. (Tony Goldwyn) who ordered it.  When his old sergeant, Zebulon Gant (Billy Connelly), finds him and suggests the existence of a job just suited to him, he's intrigued, but his old Colonel's presence on the team does nothing for his enthusiasm.  The money does: $500 a month to travel to Japan, where the young Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) has embarked upon a program to unify his country and bring in Western technology, and there help train the Imperial Army to fight a rebellious Samurai lord named Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).  The Army turns out to be a ragtag band of conscripts that breaks in terror when it first faces the rebels, leaving Algren and Gant virtually alone, and when Gant is killed Algren goes berserk.  Katsumoto is deeply impressed by his fighting, and when Algren collapses, wounded and exhausted, he refuses to permit the American to be slain; instead, he takes him along as a prisoner, hoping to ""understand our new enemy.""  Slowly recovering his strength in the Samurai stronghold, Algren is at first little impressed by the Samurai ethos, but slowly he begins to realize the genuineness of their dedication and spirituality; always a quick study, he learns to speak Japanese and becomes so expert with the wooden practice swords that he fights Katsumoto's best warrior, Ujio (Jiroyuki Sanada), to a draw; and slowly he begins to understand that the Samurai, like the Indians, are fighting for their way of life.  A strange friendship grows up between him and Katsumoto, and Algren also finds himself attracted to his host's sister, whose husband he killed in the battle.  When the Emperor offers Katsumoto a safe-conduct to Tokyo, Algren goes there with him and is ready to leave the country, but on learning that the Samurai has been arrested and condemned to death, he engineers a daring plan to free him, and joins him in one last glorious but futile stand against the forces of modernity.Algren isn't always a likeable character, but he's very human and comprehensible, and Cruise portrays with sensitivity and believability his slow conversion to the Samuari cause.  (The film is based on fact: curious viewers might want to consult Wikipedia's article on the Meiji Restoration to see how it all began and what effects it had on later Japanese history, including the country's character today.)  Hans Zimmer's thunderous scoreThe Last Samuraiand the excellently choreographed duel and battle scenes are pluses, and while the movie is rated R for violence, discreet and creative camerawork prevents any really shocking or disgusting sequences.

Several battle sequences, especially early in the film when Tom Cruise's character is surrounded by armored samurai, are tremendously exciting. I also appreciate Hollywood's recreation of actual events in Japanese history involving samurai warrior Saigo Takamori during the 1870s. But one cannot escape the overall feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu throughout this film, with a predictable chain of ""Dances With Wolves"" - like events leading to the redemption of the film's main character. And the ending, as Hollywoodized as any in recent memory, is so unbelievable (and offensive) as to almost capsize the entire film.""The Last Samurai"" is a tragedy, make no doubt. Film director Edward Zwick (who also brought us the superior epic ""Glory,"" which did not have a tacked on Hollywood ending) details throughout this film that this band of colorful and fluffy samurai warriors, the last of their kind, are headed for a Charge of the Light Brigade type conclusion. This is going to be a final, tragic stand for an ancient way of life. So to cop out (for the most part) is insulting and offensive. Why pull the punch?!Tom Cruise gives a good performance as a former captain in the U.S. Army. He is haunted by his bloody tenure in Custer's Seventh Calvary, which included the murder of defenseless Native Americans. He is hired on as a mercenary in Japan to train the Emperor's new army in the art of modern/Western warfare. During his first encounter with a samurai rebel force, his men flee and he is captured. Cruise winters in the hidden samurai village, eventually learning their ways and making peace with a dishonorable past. Along his symbolic journey, Cruise bonds with the warrior's leader, wonderfully played by American newcomer Ken Watanabe.Zwick has gone on record as stating his admiration for the late-great filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who produced brilliant samurai epics during his day including ""The Seven Samurai,"" ""Ran"" and ""Kagemusha."" ""The Last Samurai"" is not anywhere near as good as those films, and lacks the kind of energy, action detail and eventually, profound tragedy that marks those international classics. Kurosawa touches are evident throughout, and the film does not suffer for it.""The Last Samurai"" must eventually be termed a too-Hollywood product, possessing the kind of epic detail seen in great films, but lacking the courage to carry through with its tragic vision.",3,"A polished, though predictable samurai epic",1071014400,"12 10, 2003",2003,2500,"['Make', 'doubt', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'sweeping', 'well-produced', 'epic', 'immensely', 'entertaining', 'Several', 'battle', 'sequences', 'especially', 'early', 'film', 'when', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'surrounded', 'armored', 'samurai', 'are', 'tremendously', 'exciting', 'also', 'appreciate', 'Hollywood', 'recreation', 'actual', 'events', 'Japanese', 'history', 'involving', 'samurai', 'warrior', 'Saigo', 'Takamori', '1870s', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'overall', 'feeling', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'film', 'predictable', 'chain', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'events', 'leading', 'redemption', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'ending', 'as', 'Hollywoodized', 'recent', 'memory', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'offensive', 'almost', 'capsize', 'entire', 'film', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'tragedy', 'make', 'doubt', 'Film', 'director', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'who', 'also', 'brought', 'superior', 'epic', 'Glory', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'tacked', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'details', 'film', 'band', 'colorful', 'fluffy', 'samurai', 'warriors', 'last', 'kind', 'are', 'headed', 'Charge', 'Light', 'Brigade', 'type', 'conclusion', 'going', 'be', 'final', 'tragic', 'stand', 'ancient', 'way', 'life', 'So', 'cop', 'out', 'most', 'part', 'insulting', 'offensive', 'Why', 'pull', 'punch', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'good', 'performance', 'former', 'captain', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'haunted', 'bloody', 'tenure', 'Custer', 'Seventh', 'Calvary', 'included', 'murder', 'defenseless', 'Native', 'Americans', 'hired', 'mercenary', 'Japan', 'train', 'Emperor', 'new', 'army', 'art', 'modern/Western', 'warfare', 'first', 'encounter', 'samurai', 'rebel', 'force', 'men', 'flee', 'captured', 'Cruise', 'winters', 'hidden', 'samurai', 'village', 'eventually', 'learning', 'ways', 'making', 'peace', 'dishonorable', 'past', 'symbolic', 'journey', 'Cruise', 'bonds', 'warrior', 'leader', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'American', 'newcomer', 'Ken', 'Watanabe.Zwick', 'gone', 'record', 'stating', 'admiration', 'late-great', 'filmmaker', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'who', 'produced', 'brilliant', 'samurai', 'epics', 'day', 'including', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'Ran', 'Kagemusha', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'not', 'anywhere', 'as', 'good', 'films', 'kind', 'energy', 'action', 'detail', 'eventually', 'profound', 'tragedy', 'international', 'classics', 'Kurosawa', 'touches', 'are', 'evident', 'film', 'not', 'suffer', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'must', 'eventually', 'be', 'termed', 'too-Hollywood', 'product', 'possessing', 'kind', 'epic', 'detail', 'seen', 'great', 'films', 'lacking', 'courage', 'carry', 'tragic', 'vision']",N/A
808034,A3BOUPGDLG7QPP,B0001JXOUS,"Christian Hunter ""Christian Hunter""","[2, 7]","As soon as I could digest the fact that this movie advertised Tom Cruise as a Samurai I became excited by what appeared to be an epic saga about Japans tumultuous transition from millenia old traditionalism, into the modern era.  I figured, at the least, Samurai are interesting to watch; right?  Plus Edward Zwick (the Director) was the dude who also directed Glory...Gobs of money were spent on the finest talent, set design, musical production, and effects........and it all shows.  This movie is beautiful to look at and interesting to watch.  Too bad it has about as much meaning as a plate of dog barf.Those looking for the substance of Glory (or a South Park episode for that matter) are in for grave disapointment. But before you get all worked up and angry about that, consider the movies basic premise:War weary mercenary enlists his services to the Japanese Imperial Army (not as some of the reviews contend ""to crush the Samurai"", but rather to modernize the military and keep it competitive with the rest of the world).  A rogue Samurai (Katsumoto) takes up arms against the evil Imperial Army (headed by the Emperor) to defend the ""way of the Samurai"" and the ancient (inarguably beautiful) way of life they preserve.Ok, a little wobbly, but it gets way more conflicted.  Almost as if they started making the movie before they took the basic philosophical premise to its logical end...Following below are some of the conflicts that made this movie a ""hero agnostic"", conflicted, collage of plot-slop.The Samurai, as cool as they were, were dead meat.  They used swords!  Sure, they used them well, very well (and some arrows too), but one word ""machine gun"" (ok, two).  Hello?!!  The whole purpose of a Samurai is to defend their masters (typically the ruling class).  With the advent of modern weaponry, their refusal to change with the times negated their worth to ""useless"".  Many of them stepped aside, this story is about one moron who didn't (Katsumoto), and instead caused the death of just about every innocent, selfless, loving person under his guardianship.Ok, it'd be one thing if ""the enemy"" was real, but the enemy was led by the Emperor, his sworn master.  Sure, the Emperor was being influenced by greedy counsel, but in the movie, at every juncture of opportunity, Katsumoto acted like some hot-headed blood thirsty baby.  Even when the Emperor granted him special audience to to plead his case, he TOTALLY deferred to the Emperors judgment.Well, the Emperor needed to modernize Japan.  The Samurai were finished.  But I guess that wouldn't sell tickets, so we had to watch Katsumoto lead all those that were sworn to him into a completely futile attempt to fight the machine gun toting opposition.  Kinda cool I guess.  That is, if you're not the kind to be bothered by the fact that this kind of mindless leadership (and more importantly mindless obedience) is the cause of most all of mankinds war and resultant gore, broken bodies, broken civilizations, and broken families.Hey, I love war movies (Empire of the Sun stands as one of my favorites), and I don't need a ""pure hero"" to root for.

Middleton,"[1, 4]","This film truly captures the essence of the Hagakure, a document written by Tsunetomo Yamamoto in the eighteenth century, and that is the essential dictate for all warriors of the Samurai: to die!If you are looking for historical accuracy in this film, you'll be disappointed. This is a brushstroke rendering of the Menji regime, a time when Japan sought out western technology and customes in order to `keep up' with Europe and the U.S. during the Industrial Revolution. The film's theme is the conflict between the old ways and the new and if the old culture has any place in the modern world. This film was successful in many ways, communicating the message that basic human values, Samurai values - honour, loyalty, courage, discipline and the essence of service, one's basic duty to one's family, the clan and one's country, holds more value than technological advances.As has been mentioned many times, the true star of this picture is Ken Watanabe, as the Lord of the clan he displays all the virtues of the Samurai without having to utter a word. This actor has great presence, and for me, made this picture worthwhile. Cruise's character, a professional soldier racked with guilt, drowning his conscience with alcohol, to then be assimilated into a Samurai clan, to learn their ways, managed to pull it off.If this film should win any awards, it would be for production design and cinematography. Japan's simplistic beauty in architecture, landscape and period costumes appear to be accurate and very beautiful. As a period piece, my feeling is that they captured the atmosphere of the time, making the film a pleasure to view.The Last Samurai does capture the basic philosophy of the Samurai warrior and does so with great respect.

The features are, sadly, the exact same as the DVD, and for some reason they decided it wasn't worth it to subtitle the Japanese content in the extras.

808039,A3DTUMLBZCG47D,B0001JXOUS,Connor J. Hamilton,"[1, 3]","I did not hear the best reviews of The Last Samurai when it came out. Many said it was a good film, but not up to the epic status it had obviously tried to achieve. My mother is not at all a Tom Cruise fan, so I did not hear much good about him either.Then my grandparents glowingly recommended the movie to my whole family, and we decided to watch it with them one night when they came over. What I had seen when it ended was a moving, excellent film which, if not perhaps an epic, is certainly a wonderful tale of a culture and heritage slipping away from an ancient and lasting civiliazation.As I said, this movie is perhaps not an epic on the scale of-The Lord of the Rings, for example. It does not contain quite the sweep and grand scale that the latter has in buckets. It is about honor, about discipline, and about a man from a completely different country who joins forces with the samurai. So no, I would not necessarily call it an epic, although it certainly contains some of the ingredients of one. Whether the director and screenwriters intended it to be, I do not know, but that certainly does not keep it from being one of the better films I have seen.The hero is Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War veteran and soldier in the 7th Cavalry who fought in the Indian wars. At the beginning of the film, however, he is not employed in warfare, but in promoting the weapons of the Winchester arms company. He does not come out to perform in time, however, and he is fired.Another job comes his way, however, when his commander asks him to accept the offer of a certain Mr. Omura, a man highly ranked in the Japanese government who, in accordance with his and the Japanese emperor's wishes to westernize his nation, is employing American soldiers to train the Japanese army. Algren agrees, although horrible memories of attacking innocent settlements in the Indian wars make him loathe his commander.Once in Japan, Algren assumes the responsibility of training the Japanese army, which consists mostly of peasants who have never even held guns.Then, before the army is fully trained, a samurai leader, Katsumoto, a man who thinks Japan is changing too quickly, continues the rebellion he had previously begun by attacking the railroad owned by the same Mr. Omura who hired Algren. Algren's superiors insist on attacking, despite Algren maintaining that the troops are unready for combat.Despite superior firepower and numbers, the Samurai win a resounding victory at the battle, and Algren is captured. But after several difficult months, he finds himself living among friends, not enemies. He is captivated by the ideals and disciplines of the samurai, and comes to fight on their side in a climactic battle whose outcome will decide Japan's future.The directing is certainly very good-Edward Zwick seems to be one of those talented fellows who can have two characters very obviously love each other without commiting fornication. That was one of the most amazing aspects of this movie. The sister of Katsumoto comes to love Algren during the course of his stay, and they actually remain chaste. Wow! What a concept! I am sick of having well-made movies filled with trash that renders it off-limits, and The Last Samurai was refreshingly free of sex.A word of warning, though-it is fairly violent, and there is some swearing, so despite it's good qualities I wouldn't recommend it for the younger children.The camera-work is also excellent, giving us some views of the wonderful countryside of...New Zealand. I find it a little strange that this movie was not actually filmed in Japan, but the country is so beautiful I can overlook it, and it looked to me like a place that could easily be found in Japan. But I have never been there, so don't take my word for it.The acting is good, and having no previous exposure to Tom Cruise I was able to be satisfied with his performance and not have any unpleasant memories from his past films. Ken Watanabe is very good as Katsumoto, and Hiroyuki Koyuki is wonderful as Katsumoto's sister.But perhaps the best of all are the values in Last Samurai. Honor, devotion to duty, discipline, and courage to do what you believe is right in the face of danger are all lauded here. I don't think Western culture is being universally blasted here, but I do think the film makers are trying to say that technology is not all that matters; but that values and morals should be honored and practiced.

I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching a remake of the epic mini series &quot;Shogun&quot;.Algren, is an alcoholic military hero carrying the emotional baggage of guilt, a result of numerous, senseless U.S. cavalry massacres of Western Indians.  He is recruited by an emissary of the emperor of Japan to help develope a Westernized army in 1876.  Japan is trying to mainstream itself into a modern economy and throw away the yoke of feudal samurai society.The young naive and impressionable emperor, influenced by the lecherous emissary Omura played nicely by Masato Harada is attempting to quash a rebellious band of samurai lead by Katsumoto.  Katsumoto, the emperor's former teacher, is played skillfully by star of the flick Ken Watanabe.In an attack by the inexperienced Japanese army, Cruise is wounded and captured by the samurai.  As a prisoner in the samarai village, he is eventually schooled in the disciplined ways of the samurai.  He is lured into their culture and ridding himself of his emotional demons becomes one of them.

Certainly, a beautiful story about the transformation of the Japanese culture without the Tom Cruise character, but the story of Nathan Algren is a nice mirror to that of the real hero of the story, Katsumoto who is portrayed in magnificent fashion by Ken Wantanabe.At the beginning of the story, Algren is a lost and drunken soul performing as a shill in a traveling sideshow.  He is drawn into a minor program of the American trade delegation to train Japanese soldiers to use Western military weapons and to perform as Western soldiers in the suppression of a band of renegade Samurai.They are rushed to battle against Algren's recommendations and are brutally defeated.  Algren fights bravely.  In fact, he wouldn't mind dying.  Instead, his bravery interest Katsumoto and he is spared, nursed back to health, and learns some of the ways of the Samurai.  Of course, he is won over to their cause and helps them in their final battle against the massed armies of the Emperor.That is all I want to say about the story.  It really does work and is filmed very beautifully (and a strong reason for the widescreen version).  Those who want an action film might not like the time devoted to Algren's finding himself and becoming sympathetic to the Samurai.  I am glad to have that part of the story.  It also helps us get to know some of the other Samurai and their values and why they are willing to die rather than simply adopt Western Modernity.

Events occur that cause Tom Cruise to be a captive of the deadly but extremely polite Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) who is the leader of the Japanese Samurai. This is where the movie really starts to shine and and a beautiful forgotten world that we know little about comes alive thanks to the great director Edward Zwick and the ledgendary Hans Zimmer brings an unforgettable soundtrack.Tom Cruise has been in the movie industry for a long time and to date in my opinion this is by far his best performance. He discovered after his capture that the samurai are peaceful and as bad as they are made out to be, Cruise's character becomes emotionally bound to them and he integrates himself into their society after working hard to earn their trust. Another special part of the film is that a relationship develops between Algren and a quiet widow by the name of Taka, however this isn't a main part of the film it shows that the film isn't all about power and a disappearing nation but an emotional and beautiful aspect of the film.The Last Samurai is a deep emotional and violent film which has become a  triumphant in the movie industry.

I kept feeling like I'd seen this movie before.Actually, the movie works best when it's in &quot;Dances&quot; mode, chronicling the adventures of a depressed white Civil War hero (Cruise in the Costner role) who adopts the lifestyle and teachings of a threatened civilization and ends up defending said civilization against encroaching white society. This is the most compelling aspect of the movie, even though its structure is borrowed whole from a film that most people now claim to despise because of its &quot;political correctness.&quot;Cruise is very good as Nathan Algren, the alien in 19th century Japan, caught in the middle of a civil war of another kind, between ancient Samurai warriors and a government seeking to &quot;modernize&quot; itself with weapons imported from the U.S. He's bested by Ken Watanabe as a Samurai tribal chief interested in learning the ways of his enemy. Algren eventually becomes an honorary Samurai himself and fights against his own people, in a climactic battle lifted entirely from &quot;Braveheart.&quot;Most of the action scenes are exciting, and there's plenty of Bushido lore and swordplay to keep Samurai enthusiasts happy.

Director Edward Zwick who made the astounding ""Glory"" along with the fine film""Legends of Fall,"" makes another epic with powerful direction.Tom Cruise delivers a powerful performance ascaptain nNathan Algren.  He was a hero during the Civil War, but he feels much shame for a horrible atrocity which he participated in which was a slaughter of Indian women and children.  He feels remorse for the Indians and much contempt in the general who he helped commit the act.  So he flees to Japan to train the Japanese army for 500 dollars a month.  During a beginning battle he is captured by a group of Samurai warriors.  Ken Watanabe is so compelling as the Samurai leader he nearly humiliates Cruise.  Cruise is so amazed by the teachings and beliefs of the Samurai he stays with them and fights for their cause.Being a $140 million epic, The Last Samurai truly does deliver.  The battle sequences are spectacular, some of the best since Mel Gibson's Braveheart.  The Last Samurai is rated R for Strong Violence and Battle Sequences.  The battles are not exceptionally bloody but include guns, bayonets, swords, arrows, spears and cannonfire.  They are made to be more intense than actually gory.The film has been nominated for 3 Golden Globes. Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best Origianl Score are the nominees. It will probably receive a substantial amount of Academy Award nominations, we'll just have to wait and see.  All in all a fine film worth viewing in theatres and owning on Video or DVD.  For the Best Actor award, it will definetly be between Tom Cruise and Jude Law, in my opinion.",4,The Last Samurai- An Entertaining Epic,1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,1704,"['Last', 'Samurai', 'new', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'action', 'epic', 'nice', 'perfomances', 'great', 'battle', 'sequences', 'Director', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'who', 'made', 'astounding', 'Glory', 'fine', 'film', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'epic', 'powerful', 'direction.Tom', 'Cruise', 'powerful', 'performance', 'ascaptain', 'nNathan', 'Algren', 'was', 'hero', 'Civil', 'War', 'much', 'shame', 'horrible', 'atrocity', 'participated', 'was', 'slaughter', 'Indian', 'women', 'children', 'remorse', 'Indians', 'much', 'contempt', 'general', 'who', 'helped', 'commit', 'act', 'Japan', 'train', 'Japanese', 'army', '500', 'dollars', 'month', 'beginning', 'battle', 'captured', 'group', 'Samurai', 'warriors', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'so', 'compelling', 'Samurai', 'leader', 'nearly', 'Cruise', 'Cruise', 'so', 'amazed', 'teachings', 'beliefs', 'Samurai', 'fights', 'cause.Being', '140', 'million', 'epic', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'truly', 'deliver', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'spectacular', 'best', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Braveheart', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'rated', 'R', 'Strong', 'Violence', 'Battle', 'Sequences', 'battles', 'are', 'not', 'exceptionally', 'bloody', 'include', 'guns', 'bayonets', 'swords', 'arrows', 'spears', 'cannonfire', 'are', 'made', 'be', 'more', 'intense', 'actually', 'gory.The', 'film', 'been', 'nominated', '3', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Origianl', 'Score', 'are', 'nominees', 'will', 'probably', 'receive', 'substantial', 'amount', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'fine', 'film', 'worth', 'viewing', 'theatres', 'owning', 'Video', 'DVD', 'Best', 'Actor', 'award', 'will', 'definetly', 'be', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Jude', 'Law', 'opinion']",N/A

808056,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B0001JXOUS,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[4, 12]","Every year a crop of prestige pictures get dumped out of the major studios in Hollywood.  Every one of these large scale epics is full of wild battles, romance, outstanding performances, and the cream of the crop celebrities.  These are the films that are especially created to win the coveted Academy Awards.  The problem is every year one film is so big, so bloated, and so prestigious it turns into a silly mess.  This year's film is EDWARD ZWICK'S THE LAST SAMURAI.  A fun action film that longs to be SCHINDLER'S LIST.The Last Samurai stars Tom Cruise (Vanilla Sky) as Captain Algern, a soldier who stood with General Custer as he made his famous last stand.  While in battle he is forced to kill innocent Native American women and children, and it eats away at his soul.  Turning him to drink.When his old associates give him a job training Japanese soldiers to fight against a Samurai warrior named Katsumoto (Ken Wantanabe, T.R.Y.).  Everything seems okay.  That is until he's captured by Katsumoto and begins to learn the law of the Samurai.THE LAST SAMURAI at it's best boasts some of the most breathtaking close up battle scenes I've seen in a long time.  I could hardly believe that for once I could follow the battles, because for the first time in a long time the camera stayed pretty steady.  It simply wasn't sound effects and shaky steady cams moving around.  It was real, and true battle choreography.  Now that made me smile.I also loved the scene in which Algern battles a group of overzealous Japanese soldiers who are attacking his friend.  The scene actually works and is a rare sight.  A modern fight scene that doesn't feature wire effects or CGI.  It reminded me of old Bruce Lee movies.  A scene that was about a fight and not about special effects creating it.SAMURAI also features a nice relationship between Algern and Katsumoto.  Enemies that become friends, Wantanabe's character is strong because it feels real.  Unlike SONNY CHIBA's silly turn as the proverb spouting sword dealer in KILL BILL.  Wantanabe exudes the feeling of a real Samurai and not of a silly Kung Fu movie reject.  I loved how he could embody this man who is torn between his country and his king.SAMURAIS real flaw is that it thinks it's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE SEVEN SAMURAI, CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, and DANCES WITH WOLVES, when it's really just a fun battle movie.  It takes itself far too seriously.  You watch it with this feeling that at any moment you'll see a graphic pop on the screen that says ""FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.""It also gets the award for the silliest and most melodramatic thing screamed by an actor in peril in 2003.  Algern is going through alcohol withdrawal and screams ""SAKI"" at the top of his lungs.  I was sitting next to my brother-in-law, and every time the film hit another stupidly melodramatic moment I would whisper ""Saki!!""  It kept me entertained.I was also aghast that in front of me a small boy no more than five was sitting there.  There is a pretty gruesome scene in which a man loses his head.  Never have a felt so badly for a little child than I did when he screamed out in terror and then latched onto his mothers shoulder.  LISTEN PARENTS OF THE WORLD, THE RATING SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED SO THAT THIS KIND OF THING DOESN'T HAPPEN.  YOU WANT TO WATCH AN R-RATED MOVIE RENT IT AT YOUR LEISURE.  DON'T BRING A FIVE YEAR OLD TO THE MOVIES TO WATCH IT. (Calming Down) Thank you!THE LAST SAMURAI is a mixed bag.  On one hand its breathtaking to watch and on the other its kinda of silly.  I'm going to recommend it to those whom like really cool battle sequences.  But for the rest of you why not give THE SEVEN SAMURAI or even BRAVHEART a chance.

Its hardhitting impact is intense enough to keep audiences' eyes wide open through the whole movie.  Its written plot of a US soldier changing his life for the better in Japan is brilliant.  Despite the war themes, there are some great heartwarming scenes, namely when the US soldier starts healing his pains from his US war battles.  As he begins learning Japanese traditions, he begins learning more about himself, which plays a crutial part in the film.  As this develops, the drama also develops, which keeps audiences interested.  This allows the conflicts between the two sides to be brought out as brilliantly as it was.  His friends' life stories add an additional unique flavor.  The war scenes are uniquely intense.  Few other movies have thought of such original war scenery.  This teaches audiences that there is no one way to fight a war or to solve a conflict.Its Oscar-nominated 1870's Japanese setting is flawless.  They prove that they did their research to construct such an elaborate set.  The war scenes are desplicted as brutal as they should thanks to the special effects.  The costumes are accurate from those times.  Such great background offers an improved sense of this masterpiece film.Tom Cruise's underrated role as US soldier Nathan Algren is his best in years.  His two years of training to prepare for his role paid off.  He never loses his intense sense of emotion for a second.  The pain and agony expressed are as pure as if he actually lived it.  Ken Watanabe's Oscar-nominated role as Samarai leader Katsumoto rightfully places him in the spotlight.  This performance makes acting appear easy when it's actually the opposite.  He proves that he will become a big-name actor in the next following years.  All other actors also performed their roles beautifully.""The Last Samarai"" is great for those looking for a unique war movie with emotion.  This is sure to please many audiences.

808059,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B0001JXOUS,David A. Wend,"[3, 4]","The Last Samurai is a beautiful film, the kind of epic that David Lean might have made.  The film is true to historical events that happened in Japan during 1876-77.  In particular, meticulous care was taken with the recreation of Tokyo and the clothing that was being worn, traditional Japanese and modern clothing. The clash of tradition versus the influence of the West is sharply portrayed in these contrasts. Like all historical epics, departures and simplifications of the truth have to be made for the sake of a coherent film.  Certainly, there were no Americans fighting along with the samurai but the character of Captain Algren allows us to explore what is going on in Japan from the traditional and modernistic points of view.  What makes The Last Samurai an excellent historical film is what also makes for a great historical novel: sticking close to historical facts, knowing the details of the society your characters are living in and developing a believable and interesting story.  The story of The Last Samurai fulfills all of this for me.Edward Zwick has captured some excellent performances.  Tom Cruise as Captain Algren has a truly memorable performance, one that he trained for several months to deliver.  I must confess that I was not a early fan of Tom Cruise but his work in recent years has been impressive and in this film he truly becomes the character he is portraying. Ken Watanabe is wonderful as Kasumoto, loosely based on the life of Saigo Takamori, capturing the essence of the duty of a samurai and also the contemplative side of a warrior.  The talk of his writing a poem on a blossom reminded me that prior to the real battle depicted in the film the warriors spent the night before engaged in writing poetry.  The performances by the supporting cast are excellent.  Of special note is Koyuki (playing Taka, Kasumoto's sister) who must care for the man who killed her husband and who gradually finds herself falling in love.  Her sensitive performance is one of the highlights of the film.  Shin Koyamada, who plays Kasumoto's son Nobutada, brings pathos to his character, particularly in the scene where he is humiliated by Japanese soldiers for being dressed as a samurai.The battle sequences were carefully stage with an eye for authenticity and the village where Algren is kept a prisoner was so meticulously constructed that the Japanese extras were struck by its resemblance to the villages where they grew up.The cinematography is very impressive and the music by Hans Zimmer beautifully builds the mood.  The DVD has some wonderful supplemental pieces that explain various aspects of the production of the film.

The story! - such schlock! Such triteness! Such utterly lacking not only in originality, it didn't even try to bother with putting some kind of creative spin on the rehashing of old stories. And of course the ubiquitous &quot;Man is healed up by the wife of the man he killed and at first she hates him but slowly they fall in love because he shows kindness to her son&quot; yada yada yada blah blah blah ad nauseum.And as is typical, Cruise acts about as well as a puppet being controlled by a drunkard with palsy.  Why does this guy continue to get movie roles? Oh yeah, he'll draw people into the movie so the movie will make money. If it were me, and I were making a movie, Cruise would be my last choice. I'd rather havea  good movie I could be proud of then have &quot;star power&quot; to lure people into the theater.And let's not even get into the fact that this story takes place at a pivotal moment in Japan's history - a very sad moment in time - and the film does no justice to significance of the end of the samurai except in a trite cliche way that no doubt appeals to the illformed emotional status of sophomores.I went into this movie with excitement - in previews, it definitely looked beautifully filmed, and I'd heard that some Japanese historians helped with it to keep it pure and on target historically.  I thought, against the fact that Cruise is in it, it would manage to pull itself up and be something really special.  Sadly, it didn't.

808066,A3GQKB1KF0CRPE,B0001JXOUS,"Deborah MacGillivray ""Author,""","[1, 1]","I don't go to the theatre that often anymore.  I don't have to drive, waste gas, have a headache finding a parking space, waiting in line and spend enough for two tickets to buy a DVD (and that does not include the Pepsi and popcorn!).  I won't mention the chewing gum and sticky cola coated floors!  For all that, I can get two DVDs and watch it as many times as I like!  I love to watch a movie several times, study it, what makes it work, what really irritates the second or third time.  Watch actors conjuring magic.  Another reason, I really curtailed my going - PR and hype - I would get all this PR pushing you to go, press and reviewers assuring you what a great movie such and such was.  I would rush to go and ended up feeling like one of P.T. Barnum's suckers.  Not only did I pay the money that would get me two DVDs, I felt the movie was NOT worth it!So, when all the hype about the LAST SAMURAI came down, Oscar nominations, I held back going, wait for DVD.  Everyone kept assuring me I would LOVE this film, with its historical background that it would be my cup of tea.  However, Tom Cruise was a sticking point.  I was blown away from Tom Cruise stealing the thunder from Timothy Hutton (a talented actor whose work I appreciate) in TAPS.  Cruise was brilliant in the small role and everything pointed to him being a great actor.  Instead, Cruise became a ""star"".  There is a BIG difference between a great actor and a superstar.  And Cruise seemed content to flash his killer smile and coast by, rather than step up the plate and hit ""a home run"".  This has always tarnished his performances - to me - I hate to see great talent not reach their potential.  So I had that reservation going into the LAST SAMURAI.It was breathtaking to see the film where he FINALLY stopped being Cruise and go for the golden ring.  This film saw him, for once, not playing Tom Cruise, but actually forgetting he was Cruise.  He became Nathan Algren, a mentally weary warrior who was sickened by the aftermath of Little Big Horn, a warrior who has lost all honor, and it's slowly eating away inside him, crippling his whole life.  He is recruited to go to Japan to teach their soldiers how to fight.  Cruise is still hanging on by his fingernails mentally, because he is serving under the very man he hold responsible for Indian Massacres  who once again cares little about lives, and orders Algren to take the unready troops to face the mighty Samurai.  Cruise is equipped with reasonably modern weapons - I say reasonably, because they are still musket loaders instead of the repeating rifles that came out of the Civil War, such as Sharpes and Winchester.  Still, the arrogant commander feels even the unready troops could put down a rebelling from a few hundred warriors with swords and bows.  Cruise unit finds out differently, as they are nearly wiped out.  Cruise goes down fighting as a true warrior and earns the awe and admiration from the Samurai leader Katsumoto - beautifully played by Ken Watanabe.  Katsumoto is not fighting against his Emperor, rather fighting the advisors around him wishing to exploit Japan.Katsumoto takes Algren back to his mountain strong hold, heals him.  He is a prisoner, but basically allowed the run of the compound.  As he slowly comes out of his nightmares and drunken stupors, he finds a world that is built on honor, something he long ago lost.  The people are gentle, live by a code and do not fear death - if it comes with honor.  He gradually joins the warriors training and earns the love and respect of the Samurai, and comes to love them in return.  They go forward knowing they are out numbered, out gunned, but in the timeless way of the Samurai, they face death with honor in order to make a statement.It is beautifully filmed, deftly directed with a true understanding of the subject, and Cruise and Watanabe are brilliant.It just does not get any better than this (though I would have loved to see Viggo have Cruise's role!)",5,a beautiful masterpiece,1087603200,"06 19, 2004",2004,3981,"['do', ""n't"", 'go', 'theatre', 'often', 'anymore', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'drive', 'waste', 'gas', 'have', 'headache', 'finding', 'parking', 'space', 'waiting', 'line', 'spend', 'enough', 'two', 'tickets', 'buy', 'DVD', 'not', 'include', 'Pepsi', 'popcorn', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'chewing', 'gum', 'sticky', 'cola', 'coated', 'floors', 'can', 'get', 'two', 'DVDs', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'like', 'love', 'watch', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'study', 'what', 'work', 'what', 'really', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'Watch', 'actors', 'conjuring', 'magic', 'reason', 'really', 'curtailed', 'going', 'PR', 'hype', 'would', 'get', 'PR', 'pushing', 'go', 'press', 'reviewers', 'assuring', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'such', 'such', 'was', 'would', 'rush', 'go', 'ended', 'up', 'feeling', 'one', 'P.T', 'Barnum', 'suckers', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'pay', 'money', 'would', 'get', 'two', 'DVDs', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'NOT', 'So', 'when', 'hype', 'LAST', 'SAMURAI', 'came', 'down', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'held', 'back', 'going', 'wait', 'DVD', 'Everyone', 'kept', 'assuring', 'would', 'LOVE', 'film', 'historical', 'background', 'would', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'However', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'sticking', 'point', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'stealing', 'thunder', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'talented', 'actor', 'work', 'appreciate', 'TAPS', 'Cruise', 'was', 'brilliant', 'small', 'role', 'everything', 'pointed', 'being', 'great', 'actor', 'Instead', 'Cruise', 'became', 'star', 'BIG', 'difference', 'great', 'actor', 'superstar', 'Cruise', 'seemed', 'content', 'flash', 'killer', 'smile', 'coast', 'rather', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'hit', 'home', 'run', 'always', 'tarnished', 'performances', 'hate', 'see', 'great', 'talent', 'not', 'reach', 'potential', 'had', 'reservation', 'going', 'LAST', 'SAMURAI.It', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'see', 'film', 'where', 'FINALLY', 'stopped', 'being', 'Cruise', 'go', 'golden', 'ring', 'film', 'saw', 'once', 'not', 'playing', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'actually', 'forgetting', 'was', 'Cruise', 'became', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'mentally', 'weary', 'warrior', 'who', 'was', 'sickened', 'aftermath', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'warrior', 'who', 'lost', 'honor', 'slowly', 'eating', 'away', 'crippling', 'whole', 'life', 'recruited', 'go', 'Japan', 'teach', 'soldiers', 'how', 'fight', 'Cruise', 'still', 'hanging', 'fingernails', 'mentally', 'serving', 'very', 'man', 'responsible', 'Indian', 'Massacres', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'little', 'lives', 'orders', 'Algren', 'take', 'unready', 'troops', 'face', 'mighty', 'Samurai', 'Cruise', 'equipped', 'reasonably', 'modern', 'weapons', 'say', 'reasonably', 'are', 'still', 'musket', 'loaders', 'instead', 'repeating', 'came', 'Civil', 'War', 'such', 'Sharpes', 'Winchester', 'Still', 'arrogant', 'commander', 'feels', 'even', 'unready', 'troops', 'could', 'put', 'down', 'rebelling', 'few', 'hundred', 'warriors', 'swords', 'bows', 'Cruise', 'unit', 'out', 'differently', 'are', 'nearly', 'wiped', 'out', 'Cruise', 'down', 'fighting', 'true', 'warrior', 'awe', 'admiration', 'Samurai', 'leader', 'Katsumoto', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Katsumoto', 'not', 'fighting', 'Emperor', 'rather', 'fighting', 'advisors', 'wishing', 'exploit', 'Japan.Katsumoto', 'Algren', 'back', 'mountain', 'strong', 'hold', 'heals', 'prisoner', 'basically', 'allowed', 'run', 'compound', 'slowly', 'nightmares', 'drunken', 'stupors', 'world', 'built', 'honor', 'something', 'long', 'ago', 'lost', 'people', 'are', 'gentle', 'live', 'code', 'do', 'not', 'fear', 'death', 'honor', 'gradually', 'warriors', 'training', 'love', 'respect', 'Samurai', 'love', 'return', 'go', 'forward', 'knowing', 'are', 'out', 'numbered', 'out', 'gunned', 'timeless', 'way', 'Samurai', 'face', 'death', 'honor', 'order', 'make', 'statement.It', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'deftly', 'directed', 'true', 'understanding', 'subject', 'Cruise', 'Watanabe', 'are', 'brilliant.It', 'just', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'Viggo', 'have', 'Cruise', 'role']",N/A
808067,AXGQG0PHFY6JS,B0001JXOUS,"Deidre Knight ""literary agent and author""","[5, 6]","I'm not throwing off on Tom Cruise, who, despite some bad PR decisions in the past year, I still think has the ability to breathe life into a movie.  Some of his films have been among my favorites (Jerry Maguire, for instance.) But this one belongs entirely to Watanabe who makes Katsamoto a character we empathize with and ultimately understand on an intimate level thanks to Watanabe's nuanced portrayal.The movie depicts a time of immense change--both for America and for Japan--and manages to tell a story that is much more than that of the dying Samurai's rebellion.  It's a world on the brink of industrialized warfare, a time when America has been torn apart by civil war, only to see certain elements mirrored in the far away Japanese culture.  Against this backdrop two men form an unexpected relationship: Cruise, the war shocked veteran of both the Civil War, and later the war against Native Americans as the US dominated and obliterated without truly understanding the culture that had lived on the soil first.  Katsamoto, a Samurai who had trained and tought the emperor as a boy--a man the ruler admires and doesn't want to combat--but who represents not the new ways of Gatling guns and slick combat.As Nathan (Cruise) is captured by Katsamoto (Watanabe) the two forge an unlikely friendship, finding more than same than not.  This is the true story of the film--how two men, supposedly so different, can meet on the common ground of experience and honor.I've seen this movie at least eight or nine times and would watch it again in a heartbeat.  If you love the sorts of glorious epics that Edward Zwick has created in the past (GLORY, LEGENDS OF THE FALL), and even if you don't but simply love a beautiful film with characterization at its center, this is a must see movie.",5,This is Ken Watanabe's Movie,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,1792,"[""'m"", 'not', 'throwing', 'off', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'who', 'bad', 'PR', 'decisions', 'past', 'year', 'still', 'think', 'ability', 'breathe', 'life', 'movie', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'favorites', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'instance', 'one', 'entirely', 'Watanabe', 'who', 'Katsamoto', 'character', 'empathize', 'ultimately', 'understand', 'intimate', 'level', 'thanks', 'Watanabe', 'nuanced', 'portrayal.The', 'movie', 'time', 'immense', 'change', 'America', 'Japan', 'manages', 'tell', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'dying', 'Samurai', 'rebellion', 'world', 'brink', 'industrialized', 'warfare', 'time', 'when', 'America', 'been', 'torn', 'apart', 'civil', 'war', 'only', 'see', 'certain', 'elements', 'mirrored', 'far', 'away', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'backdrop', 'two', 'men', 'form', 'unexpected', 'relationship', 'Cruise', 'war', 'shocked', 'veteran', 'Civil', 'War', 'later', 'war', 'Native', 'Americans', 'US', 'dominated', 'obliterated', 'truly', 'understanding', 'culture', 'had', 'lived', 'soil', 'first', 'Katsamoto', 'Samurai', 'who', 'had', 'trained', 'tought', 'emperor', 'boy', 'man', 'ruler', 'admires', ""n't"", 'want', 'combat', 'who', 'not', 'new', 'ways', 'Gatling', 'guns', 'slick', 'combat.As', 'Nathan', 'Cruise', 'captured', 'Katsamoto', 'Watanabe', 'two', 'forge', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'finding', 'more', 'same', 'not', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'how', 'two', 'men', 'supposedly', 'so', 'different', 'can', 'meet', 'common', 'ground', 'experience', 'honor.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'least', 'eight', 'nine', 'times', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'heartbeat', 'love', 'sorts', 'glorious', 'epics', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'created', 'past', 'GLORY', 'LEGENDS', 'THE', 'FALL', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'simply', 'love', 'beautiful', 'film', 'characterization', 'center', 'must', 'see', 'movie']",N/A
808068,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0001JXOUS,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[9, 10]","Wow!  It's a samurai flick starring Tom Cruise, and you know what: He's turing Japanese, I think He's turning Japanese, I really think so.  ""The Last Samurai"" is a film that tries to take a huge step into this imported-cult genre.  Hey, I like samurai flims and I LOVE 'Seven Samurai', so knowing that a movie like this is coming out in theaters has really got me hyped up in anticipation.  Many people say that an epic film starring Tom Cruise is a lousy gimmick for the movie to bring in the big bucks, and to make Cruise and the WB look good.  When I was checking this out, thought the lousy idea is there, ""The Last Samurai"" actually executes into a well-productive and impressive film to see.This film start off with the handsome actor as Nathan Algren, a wasted Civil War veteran grieving over his bloody memories of that war, being sent to the land of the rising sun by authorities of two nations in order to train Bigwig soldiers how to fight against the 'antagonists'.  During his first battle of Nihhon Civil War, he lost, and instead of being killed dishonerably by the oppositioners, they took him to their turf, a really nice and solitude turf.  Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), the head village chief and captain of his soldiers, decides to use him to know more on his enemies' new weapondrym and later builds a strong partnership with Algren, that which is Cruise, to stop them.Since I realized this isn't based on a true story, I knew that this movie would go by-the-numbers and there would be some easy-to-recognize foreshadowing moments. Hey, this is an epic movie; Epic = violence, betrayal, love, and honor. Actually, the formula works in high numbers for this flick.  Knowing how Algren mourned over the massacre in a native-american village his men caused many years ago, and how he was adjust to a Japanese village while he was captured was intriguing, especially when he knows much about the Japanese culture: how the people were respectable though silly like normal people, be spiritually intertwine, understand nature, and aware about life and death, even children must know about it; man, now I can understand why death is acceptable in Japanese animation.  Adding Aldren knowing the hidden samurai spirit within, and the whole plotting structure makes this raw sushi well-done.Great as it seems, on the less greener side, the movie doesn't  have a certain ingenuity that makes it inspiring and feels like it plays a big role in the movie industry and in our hearts.  The movie is very emotional and breathtaking, but it's not exactly thought-provoking.  Breathtaking is what I like to say the most on the movie's production value: good selection of cast, above-par acting, wonderful musical score, and battles mixed with somewhat-noticeable special effects that really build up an adreneline rush.'The Seven Samurai', this movie is so not at its league, but ""The Last Samurai"" is a great epic film to watch.  It's not profound, but it's still compelling in many ways.

Tom Cruise is amazing in this film, as are the rest of the cast, most outstandingly Watanabe (Katsumoto) and Koyuki (Taka).To summarize: Cruise plays a post-civil war soldier who is hired by the Japenese Emperor as a battle advisor against the rebellions of the last remaining samurai. However, the American is taken hostage by the Samurai during a battle and soon befriends the Samurai village. The Last Samurai is a story of love, spirit, and, most of all, a sacred honor which guides us all.The battle scenes, while gruesome (if you're squeamish, you might avoid this one), were amazing. The cinematography is wonderful. However, the actors, the themes, and the BREATHTAKING score carry the film to a superb quality deserving of the highest recognition.Deep down, it is a feel good movie.

First of all, the thought that the Emperor of Japan needed the wisdom of an American to set things right in his kingdom is absurd. Secondly, aren't we all getting a little tired of Tom Cruise presenting himself as some sort of super man in his movies?  He, like Mel Gibson, has  often cast himself as characters whose bravery and martial skills are of almost mythic proportions.  Additionally, these heroes are frequently disillusioned, bitter men, who, through an orgy of blood and guts discover themselves and learn to love.Folks, this is cookie cutter scripting. Those moments in this film where we are treated to shots of Cruise looking into the distance, steely eyed and noble are embarrassing. Is this really how Cruise thinks of himself? Is he so hot and so wonderful that the wife of the man he killed can't keep her hands off of him? This is one of many movies made over the years where a white man saves a picturesque but flawed culture. This is Eurocentric cultural insensitivity at its worst.The script is a series of cliches superimposed on  19th century Japan. Sadly the story could very well be transfered to any other culture with a little tweak here and there.

The viewer is treated to a slice of historical fiction that, thanks to the second accompanying DVD, examines the degree the filmmakers qwent to guarantee the accuracy of the time period through the actors, the scenary, the costumes and more.This movie is about a used up war Captain down on his luck who gets the opportunity to make a good deal of money by selling what he has left to offer - that being his lifetime of warring, of making war and of studying war.  He is perpetually haunted by the memories of his time serving under General Custer when he was ordered to murder innocent Native Americans, women and children, who he knew were innocent at the time they were slaughtered.  He became an alcoholic.  So the Captain is provided with this opportunity to go to Japan and train the newly developing Japanese army with the intention of defeating the old Samarai warriors who have been the protectors of the Japanese people for over 1000 years.  The young Emperer is being pushed into the modern times.  As a result, the Captain becomes exposed to the ways of the Samarai.  The story is absolutely captivating.Though I usualy don't do this, I watched the accompanying DVD with the special features.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[9, 14]","Recipe for instant Tom Cruise samurai flick: Take your basic samurai period drama, insert Tom Cruise, and water down liberally. Stir in cliches and do not season at all. The result? ""The Last Samurai,"" a very dull, colorless action flick set in Japan. It's not a good sign when the New Zealand scenery is the most striking thing about the whole thing.It's the mid-1800s and times are a-changin' in Japan -- the modernization of the west (meaning the USA) is sweeping away the old ways. The Emperor gets an American veteran named Nathan Algren to help train his troops. Algren is an alcoholic, filled with angst because he killed American Indians, and he hates his new job.Suddenly he's captured during an attack by samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) and dragged back to his village. After going cold turkey, he begins to appreciate the old samurai code and ways, and begins to fall in love with a beautiful widow. Taking the side of his new allies, he sets out on a seemingly doomed attack, against the very people he was sent to help... and his own troops.Even taken out of the historical context, ""Last Samurai"" is a deeply annoying film. It's laced with heavy-handed political correctness, complete with pointless insertions about American Indians and Custer. It's also  saddled with a surreally optimistic ending. Everying about it -- from Cruise's love interest to his change of heart -- is predictable, cliched and very corny.While the film is SET in Japan, the actual shooting took place in New Zealand, giving it a lush, almost fantastical backdrop for all the action. Certainly it makes director Edward Zwick's job a bit easier, even if the film is saddled with some very stilted dialogue. (""And though it may forever be obscure to me, I cannot but be aware of its power."") And enough with the ""Bob"" comments.Tom Cruise shows little emotion, and his character's alcoholic angst is almost laughably contrived. In fact, you may cheer when he gets beaten up. Ken Watanabe is what makes the film -- he has the presence of a future screen legend, and he plays Katsumoto with vulnerabilities and real feelings. This guy deserves to be the lead of such a film. Koyuki also shows incredible expressiveness as the widow Taka.For a well-acted, well-directed film that happens to be set in Japan, check out the immortal samurai films by Kurosawa. Even merely taken on its own, ""Last Samurai"" is swamped in its own sense of self-importance.

It stars Tom Cruise, but to me he was not the star of the film. I feel that the movie had most of its power from the supporting actor Ken Watanabe. The way that he acted throughout the movie could give him the Oscar in the Best Supporting Actor Catagory. The entire movie could win many different awards, and I'm glad that Tom Cruise was not nominated, because I have seen him in much better roles, like ""Minority Report,"" or ""Vanilla Sky."" His great scene comes towards the end, where he gives emotion and power at once.Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War hero who loves to drink. He's recently come from battling American Indians in the west, and often had bad memories of what took place during those battles. But Algren gets a job when Japanese businessman Omura wants him to train the new army, with somebody that he knows Bagley. Bagley wants Algren because of the way that he battled the Indians. Algren agrees when he is able to bring his fellow Army fighter Sergeant Zebulon Gant. When they make it to Japan, they are met by the translator Simon Graham, and they begin to train the troops for battle. But Omura wants them to fight the samurai and their leader Katsumoto right away, and overrules Algren causing him to take his inexperienced troops to battle the Katsumoto. Algren is almost killed during the battle, but taken back to Katsumoto's village, which is ruled by his son. Algren is trapped, and there is no way for him to be able to return back to Japan. While with Katsumoto, he learns all about the way of the samurai and he finds out that there is nothing wrong with the people that Omura wants to kill. But it also becomes clear that Bagley is getting ready to fight. Algren befriends Katsumoto, and the two learn that they have much more in common then they oringally thought, and it becomes clear to Algren what he must do.""The Last Samurai"" was a beautiful film. It had a beautiful sceney, beautiful action, some beautiful acting, and beautiful direction. I really did love it, and I am including it on the best of 2004, only beause I saw it at the very beginning of this year.

808083,A35J4XGRWXVZ00,B0001JXOUS,Edward,"[0, 0]","On seeing Edward Zwick's ""The Last Sumurai"", I had to deal with mixed feelings, good news and bad news. The good news: this is a big, beautiful movie relating an unusual story. In 1876 California an ex-Union officer Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), who has battle scars both physical and psychic, is hired by Japanese diplomats to train an American-style army for the Emperor, conscripted against a renegade samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Katsumoto hates the Western ways increasingly threatening Japan. (Katsumoto's tragic story is not really that distant: it was only three decades ago that Yukio Mishima, frustrated in his attempt to protect Japan from the sterile corruption of Westernization, committed seppuku.) Algren's campaign to train the Emperor's forces is not too successful (when he orders them to hold fire, they don't), and his first encounter with the rebel forces finds him a wounded prisoner. Algren is taken to Katsumoto's mountain outpost and kept alive so that ""we may learn our enemy"". One aspect of Japanese culture Algren is immediately obssessed with is sake; but as his stay lengthens he becomes more attentive, learning the language, mastering kendo, and enjoying a Kyogen performance. In return, he attempts to teach baseball to the village boys; but they seem to miss the concept, trying to catch the base runner instead of the ball. (They've come a long way.) Cruise is an attractive actor, and this may be his best performance to date. Algren is introduced as a bitter, indeed a broken man; but as his outlook becomes more philosophical there is a sincere depiction of a character desiring to understand the strange world around him. Cruise's scenes with Watanabe, another charismatic actor, are the film's most defining. Eventually, Algren takes sides with the samurai rebel, and when their Japanese forces face the Emperor's Japanese forces on the battlefield, it must seem like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu to the Civil War veteran, but this point is not belabored. The climatic battle is strikingly photographed by John Toll, as is the whole production. The world of mid-19th Century Japan is richly reproduced, and there's even a fascinating glimpse of 1876 San Francisco. The bad news: there is a major problem with ""The Last Samurai"" and it's the ending. Why in the name of Chikamatsu did Zwick and his co-scenarists Marshall Herskovitz and John Logan, after creating such a sensitive and arresting story, mar it with such a weak conclusion? All we need is a Henry Mancini coda. But, the ending notwithstanding, ""The Last Samurai"", spectacular and intelligent, was one of the best movies of 2003.",4,The way of the warrior,1075852800,"02 4, 2004",2004,2634,"['seeing', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'Last', 'Sumurai', 'had', 'deal', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'good', 'news', 'bad', 'news', 'good', 'news', 'big', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'relating', 'unusual', 'story', '1876', 'California', 'ex-Union', 'officer', 'Captain', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'who', 'battle', 'scars', 'physical', 'psychic', 'hired', 'Japanese', 'diplomats', 'train', 'American-style', 'army', 'Emperor', 'conscripted', 'renegade', 'samurai', 'Katsumoto', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Katsumoto', 'Western', 'ways', 'increasingly', 'threatening', 'Japan', 'Katsumoto', 'tragic', 'story', 'not', 'really', 'distant', 'was', 'only', 'three', 'decades', 'Yukio', 'Mishima', 'frustrated', 'attempt', 'protect', 'Japan', 'sterile', 'corruption', 'Westernization', 'committed', 'seppuku', 'Algren', 'campaign', 'train', 'Emperor', 'forces', 'not', 'too', 'successful', 'when', 'orders', 'hold', 'fire', 'do', ""n't"", 'first', 'encounter', 'rebel', 'forces', 'wounded', 'prisoner', 'Algren', 'taken', 'Katsumoto', 'mountain', 'outpost', 'kept', 'alive', 'may', 'learn', 'enemy', 'One', 'aspect', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'Algren', 'immediately', 'obssessed', 'sake', 'stay', 'more', 'attentive', 'learning', 'language', 'mastering', 'kendo', 'enjoying', 'Kyogen', 'performance', 'return', 'teach', 'baseball', 'village', 'seem', 'miss', 'concept', 'trying', 'catch', 'base', 'runner', 'instead', 'ball', ""'ve"", 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Cruise', 'attractive', 'actor', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'Algren', 'introduced', 'bitter', 'indeed', 'broken', 'man', 'outlook', 'more', 'philosophical', 'sincere', 'depiction', 'character', 'desiring', 'understand', 'strange', 'world', 'Cruise', 'scenes', 'Watanabe', 'charismatic', 'actor', 'are', 'film', 'most', 'defining', 'Eventually', 'Algren', 'sides', 'samurai', 'rebel', 'when', 'Japanese', 'forces', 'face', 'Emperor', 'Japanese', 'forces', 'battlefield', 'must', 'seem', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'Civil', 'War', 'veteran', 'point', 'not', 'belabored', 'climatic', 'battle', 'strikingly', 'photographed', 'John', 'Toll', 'whole', 'production', 'world', 'mid-19th', 'Century', 'Japan', 'richly', 'reproduced', 'even', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', '1876', 'San', 'Francisco', 'bad', 'news', 'major', 'problem', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'ending', 'Why', 'name', 'Chikamatsu', 'did', 'Zwick', 'co-scenarists', 'Marshall', 'Herskovitz', 'John', 'Logan', 'creating', 'such', 'sensitive', 'arresting', 'story', 'mar', 'weak', 'conclusion', 'need', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'coda', 'ending', 'notwithstanding', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'spectacular', 'intelligent', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2003']",N/A
808084,A2WELXI7RO4R2D,B0001JXOUS,Egoman,"[5, 9]","This film is a fantasy, pure and simple, beyond just the addition of a white American to the rebel samurai ranks.  This is not necessarily a problem if the movie-goer is seeking out something other than historical drama, but the viewer should keep him/herself more in mind of ""The Lord of the Rings"" than of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" when watching it.Katsumoto's deference to the Emperor is the driving force for his character, but the real samurai had no tradition of loyalty to him.  In fact, the samurai only came full-force onto the pages of history by, in effect, overthrowing the Emperor in the 12th century and usurping his power.  It wasn't until the beginning of the Meiji Era (the time in which this film is set) that the Emperor regained any real control at all, and it was his choice to ""modernize"" Japan (Army and all) out of a justified fear of European colonization and/or exploitation.  Of course, by this time the samurai had lived under centuries of isolationist peace, and had long since ceased to be warriors.  They had become the powerful hereditary nobles and bureaucrats of Japan, more akin to Cicero than Caesar, and it was not the creation of the Army that bothered most of them, but the new laws forbidding them to wear swords- the symbols of their status- in an attempt at abolition of the (deeply inefficient and unprofitable) nobility system.Nevertheless, the character of Katsumoto is indeed based on a real person, and the film on real events.  But the those who revolted were, first, a tiny minority of the samurai who continued to live by (or re-adopted) the old lifestyle; and, second, at war over the threat to their accumulated clout, rather than over some perception of Japan ""losing its way"".  Their actions were nothing more than a naked power-grab.The storied traditions of the samurai largely came to an end (as much as they ever existed) when Tokugawa Ieyasu came to power at the beginning of the 17th century.(As a side note, the scene with the ninja was the one part of the film I found truly outlandish.  Video games aside, ninja are not readily apparent in Japan.  There is little mention of them in history; they were not, and are not, especially respected or admired; and Japanese people on the whole cannot fathom the young American male's obsession with them.  There is no matching fervor on the other side of the Pacific.  What is common knowledge, however, is that at no time would dozens of them work together or get themselves caught up in an all-out attack, nor would a government trying to 'modernize' employ them.  Since they made their living on contracts against noblemen's belongings, most of decent society looked on them with more contempt than Europeans showed the most fearsome pirates).The portrayal of Japan and, specifically, samurai ""society"" in this film is the Western romantic version- like Mallory's portrayal of medieval knights and the Chivalric Code in ""L'Morte D'Arthur"".  This does not make the film entirely without merit.  The cinematography is gorgeous, and I would happily watch the film again for that alone.  The acting is fairly strong.  I personally think Tom Cruise is an excellent actor, when he chooses a good role (like in ""Rain Man"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and others), and he performs adequately here.  However, it is far from his best work, and I think it was a correct decision for the Academy not to honor him with a nomination this year.Perhaps part of the problem with the performance was a problem with the characters.  Most were rather typical of the genre known as ""epic"", and I could guess what they were going to say before the words were out of their mouths.  The story itself was easily predictable, but plot twists are not the reason most people will come to see this film.Altogether, I can best describe the movie as ""fun"".  I find it enjoyable in the same way as I do anything from ""Terminator 2"" to ""Sleepless in Seattle"".

808085,A19QIBFRAZNAIK,B0001JXOUS,"E. Kim ""wangkon936""","[3, 4]","Most people in North America don't know who the Japanese Director Akira Kurosawa is.  Nor do they know much about the Samurai. Many of Hollywood's most recognized filmmakers have been deeply influenced by the Japanese director including, but not limited to, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and John Woo. Most of Akira's films were about the Samurai and the complex warrior ethos that drove the development of some very meaningful and artistic storylines.I think this movie is a very good introduction to the everyday North American (i.e. white) audience of the Samurai and their warrior culture. There are some things that a Western audience may find difficult to understand or accept, an example being the wife of a fallen Samurai who tends to the wounds of her husband's killer. This is hard for a Western audience to understand, but in a traditional Asian culture, if your parents are dead, then your older brother becomes the moral equivalent of your father and you do what he says, no arguments. Not PC I know, but that was reality back then. Plus, I think the wife knew enough about war, being raised in a Samurai tradition, to know that there was nothing personal in what Algren did.To make a movie with wide appeal, Zwick had to dilute the Japanese culture for wider consumption, kind of like the ""green"" bottle top soy sauce that's less salty then regular  ""red"" bottle top soy sauce. However, this had too much of a ""crowd pleaser"" kind of effect on me, as I wanted to learn more about the Japanese culture at that important time in their history. The makers (and financiers) of this movie decided to entertain first and educate later. However, at least people will get something out of this, instead of just gawking at the natives.

So much so that it's a little hard to give the rest of the movie credit for the original parts it does well.  But taken on its own, I feel it merits four stars.I generally like Tom Cruise's movies, so I didn't have a problem watching him in this role.  Cruise is a talented actor, although he basically plays every part the same way, so he offers nothing terribly new here.  Still, he turns in a fine--if somewhat typical--performance.The other actors in this movie were well cast.  Much has been made about Ken Watanabe's performance.  I thought it was strong but disagree with others who felt he overshadowed Cruise and everyone else.  Those who were seduced by this romanticized portrayal of Samurai culture were probably left more inclined to gush over his performance.Along those lines--in the special features of this DVD, there was an interesting comment made by a military historian.  He rightly pointed out that the Samurai were, in essence, the 'bad guys' in this conflict.  They were fighting for a caste system that did not respect women's rights or democratic ideals.  While such a lifestyle may be beautiful to view on the screen, living it is a different matter entirely.  There is much to admire about that culture, but there is much to detest, as well.[Warning: SPOILERS in next paragraph]Apparently, some found the ending to be &quot;maudlin,&quot; but unless you felt the same about movies like Braveheart or Last of the Mohicans, I doubt you'll agree.  Yes, it's typical Hollywood fare, but no adjective approaching &quot;maudlin&quot; came to mind.  Overall, I felt it was a dramatic and appropriate ending in keeping with some earlier themes (not to mention the title of the film).  My one complaint about the ending was the poor battlefield tactics used by the Samurai.  Cruise already knew the Imperial troops had Howitzers and gattling guns, yet the Samurai made no effort to address those threats in the battle (a detachment of cavalry could have swung around and attacked their flank to neutralize them).  This costly mistake was inconsistent with the earlier portrayal of Cruise's character as being skilled in the art of modern warfare.All in all, this is an entertaining film with some nice cinematography and exciting action sequences.

Despite apparent misinterpretations, you can definitely feel that the movie was created with a mixture of awe and respect towards Japanese culture.  So what the movie lacks in realism it does, in a way, make up in heart.Different cultures and ways of living radiate a distinct feel, or 'vibe.'  Movies like 'The Joy Luck Club' and 'Heaven and Earth' were able to successfully capture the feel of the cultures those films had set out to portray; but for every Joy Luck Club, you get tons of films that fail to capture the essence and feel of Asian cultures.  Being Asian-American, I'm always on the prowl for the next good movie featuring Asian people and cultures.  The Last Samurai, however, doesn't fit in either category.  It falls upon stereotypes at times and doesn't quite capture the feel of Japanese culture, but it approaches the subject of the samurai and Japanese history so reverently and respectfully that it shouldn't be discounted as another clich&eacute;d film.The story has been gone over by many other reviewers, so I won't go into it further.  I enjoyed the process of development the main character (Algren) underwent.  I don't agree with other reviewers who criticize the film, saying that it's anti-industry.  Yes, Algren connects closer to the Earth once immersed in the natural style of living the samurai village enjoys, but I believe the message of the film is far more sophisticated than just that of ""nature good, industry bad.""  What I truly appreciated in this film is that it showed the main character finding his peace of mind through developing discipline, humility, and loyalty--all inspired and taught to him by the samurai who become his friends.  The obligatory sex scene was also excluded (thank goodness), which is more consistent with how a Japanese widow would have conducted herself.The movie boasted strong performances.  Tom Cruise's performance indicated his passion for his role, and if you watch the behind-the-scenes extras on the DVD, you'll see him brimming with enthusiasm over the history of samurai and the code of Bushido.  Ken Wanatabe was a charismatic and dynamic presence and he owned every scene he appeared in.The cinematography was well done and the scenery was absolutely gorgeous.  This is a film that is very pleasing to the eye to look at.  Whoever oversaw art direction for this film deserves a raise.  The fight scenes were choreographed nicely, as well.What the story lacked in historical accuracy and flow it made up for in heart and dignity.

The older samurai system was extremely tyrannical and brutal, and was holding Japan back from technological progress they needed to make to avoid total takeover by Western powers. We ought to bear that in mind as we admire the honor, purity, beauty, and nobility of the samurai way of life in this fictional story.Yet, there are two sides to every coin. As with our American Civil War, it is fair to say the good guys won, yet it is wrong to view the losers as perfect devils in every way. There were some good qualities to them; some valid points to their arguments. In that spirit I could easily overlook the dubious historical aspects of this film, and take its vision of the samurai as a concentrated, idealized depiction of their better side.I could poke various other holes in this movie, beginning with them carrying rifles that were still a few years off in the future when the samurai era ended. Also I hope Japanese audiences will bear with us Americans for Hollywoodically inserting ourselves so prominently into their historical moments... almost like Forrest Gump, haha.

In the place of the medieval knights is a true historical figure, Saigo Takamori, who led a rebel army to glorious defeat in the Satsuma Rebellion, a futile insurrection against the Japanese government during the early days of the Meijin Restoration.As far as history is concerned, about the only thing the movie got right was Saigo's last valiant (or quixotic) mounted charge into the murderous firepower of the modern Japanese Army.  Saigo was not the reactionary champion of Samurai privilege and custom that the movie depicted.  He was one of the chief architects of the dismantling of the Shogunate and the dragging of Japan kicking and screaming into the modern world.  For a time, he was even the commander in chief of the modern Japanese Army.Many are recognized as great decades after their death.  Saigo was that rare individual who was rightly recognized as great by his contemporaries.  It makes for a fascinating story to learn how such a man could end up dying in a futile rebellion against the government he helped to create.  But you won't find it in this movie.  For the real story of Saigo, read &quot;The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori,&quot; available from Amazon.com.While the movie got the sequence of events and the motivations of the protagonists wrong, the scenery, costumes, and weaponry appeared to be quite authentic.  Most Samurai of Saigo's time practiced swordsmanship with cane swords.  This practice lives on in Japan in the sport of Kendo.  Saigo, however, subscribed to a school of swordsmanship that prescribed the use of hardwood sticks.  The movie accurately depicts Saigo's disciples practicing with hardwood sticks.  Watching the movie depiction of that practice readily shows why most Samurai used cane swords.Another area the movie got right was the archery with the assymetrical bow.  When we Westerners think of Samurai, we think of them as swordsmen.  The Samurai were primarily archers, and the movie accurately reflects the importance of archery to the Samurai.Notwithstanding the many inaccuracies of the movie, it is a stirring adventure of epic proportions, and quite enjoyable viewing.  To borrow a phrase from another source, it is a movie for guys who like movies.  Just remember as you watch this very good movie, it is not, I repeat, not history.",4,The Satsuma Rebellion -- History versus Hollywood,1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,2613,"['Ray', 'Bradbury', 'once', 'wrote', 'short', 'story', 'medieval', 'knights', 'jousting', 'oncoming', 'train', 'Naturally', 'got', 'flattened', 'story', 'was', 'allegory', 'old', 'versus', 'new', 'modernism', 'versus', 'traditionalism', 'movie', 'short', 'story', 'expanded', 'feature', 'length', 'moved', 'Orient', 'place', 'medieval', 'knights', 'true', 'historical', 'figure', 'Saigo', 'Takamori', 'who', 'led', 'rebel', 'army', 'glorious', 'defeat', 'Satsuma', 'Rebellion', 'futile', 'insurrection', 'Japanese', 'government', 'early', 'days', 'Meijin', 'Restoration.As', 'far', 'history', 'concerned', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'got', 'right', 'was', 'Saigo', 'last', 'valiant', 'quixotic', 'mounted', 'charge', 'murderous', 'firepower', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'Army', 'Saigo', 'was', 'not', 'reactionary', 'champion', 'Samurai', 'privilege', 'custom', 'movie', 'depicted', 'was', 'one', 'chief', 'architects', 'dismantling', 'Shogunate', 'dragging', 'Japan', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'modern', 'world', 'time', 'was', 'even', 'commander', 'chief', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'Army.Many', 'are', 'recognized', 'great', 'decades', 'death', 'Saigo', 'was', 'rare', 'individual', 'who', 'was', 'rightly', 'recognized', 'great', 'contemporaries', 'fascinating', 'story', 'learn', 'how', 'such', 'man', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'dying', 'futile', 'rebellion', 'government', 'helped', 'create', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'real', 'story', 'Saigo', 'read', 'quot', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'Life', 'Battles', 'Saigo', 'Takamori', 'quot', 'available', 'movie', 'got', 'sequence', 'events', 'motivations', 'protagonists', 'wrong', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'weaponry', 'appeared', 'be', 'quite', 'authentic', 'Most', 'Samurai', 'Saigo', 'time', 'practiced', 'swordsmanship', 'cane', 'swords', 'practice', 'Japan', 'sport', 'Kendo', 'Saigo', 'however', 'subscribed', 'school', 'swordsmanship', 'prescribed', 'use', 'hardwood', 'sticks', 'movie', 'accurately', 'Saigo', 'disciples', 'practicing', 'hardwood', 'sticks', 'Watching', 'movie', 'depiction', 'practice', 'readily', 'why', 'most', 'Samurai', 'used', 'cane', 'swords.Another', 'area', 'movie', 'got', 'right', 'was', 'archery', 'assymetrical', 'bow', 'When', 'Westerners', 'think', 'Samurai', 'think', 'swordsmen', 'Samurai', 'were', 'primarily', 'archers', 'movie', 'accurately', 'importance', 'archery', 'Samurai.Notwithstanding', 'many', 'inaccuracies', 'movie', 'stirring', 'adventure', 'epic', 'proportions', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'borrow', 'phrase', 'source', 'movie', 'guys', 'who', 'movies', 'Just', 'remember', 'watch', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'repeat', 'not', 'history']",N/A

Possibly the best American film I have seen this year.Tom Cruise does a wonderful acting job as he plays a soldier divided by his duty and personal values. Choosing between duties and personal values is something most of us can relate to in the everyday world, so this movie will make a personal connection with you.Also, it's just amazing action! Some of the best battle sequences since BraveHeart, made this a real treat. The casting was excellent and the acting was solid. I was a little skeptical about japan as the backdrop for this movie, but I must say that the japanese environmental atmosphere was fantastic. Shots in the rain, fog or sunset with tom cruises black silhouettewere artistic and perfect(a real treat for the artistic eye).As a movie fan, I can't say enough good about this film.

808112,A3KULFIW5DD2TW,B0001JXOUS,Goosta,"[0, 1]","Good news: the Japanese actors and actresses are very good at acting. I appreciated their performances.Pretty much everything else is bad, in different ways. The script plain sucks. Tom Cruise is himself, occasionally fanatical in an eerily ambiguous way. He's not a bad actor, there's just moments in this film that made me cringe, like at the end when his piety is so strained that we know its contrived, but I think this is also partly because of the pathetic script, so maybe its not him.Another thing is that the musical score is woefully overblown and melodramatic, and appears too often. I long for the time when music ceases to exist in movies or at least is never again used to flatter the audience's emotions.I called the movie ironic because the categorically liberal elements responsible for the film's creation end up supporting the existence of peoples that are themselves wholly anti-liberal, under the guise of that most hackneyed platitude, a favorite amongst liberals, 'multi-culturalism'. Here we see once again an example of the eternal contradiction of liberalism; the impossibility of neutrality, to speak in Carl Schmitt's language, or at least neutralization will exist insofar as it can be manipulated by Others and not in its own right.There's a strong racial element to the film, apparent to the audience only unconsciously, the unconsciousness itself being constantly informed by the uniformly liberal media/entertainment/governmental complex. Tom Cruise is asked by his Indian-bashing, Anglo nemesis, ""why do you hate your people so much""? The answer is that its a set-up; Cruise opposes, at least explicitly, materialist/Capitalist commercialization, as evinced by the opening scene with his Winchester model 1873. Cruise doesn't explicitly condemn the white race, though he is overtly sympathetic to Indians. When asked about General Custer, he says he was a man that fell in love with his own legend. Fair enough, and he responds to a question about scalping with a honest account of the method's brutality, which would seemingly be a mark against the noble-savage idealization of 'Native-Americans', as its something never mentioned by academic liberals or if it is we learn of it in conjunction with equally brutal examples of white domination, so as to maintain the fraud of academic impartialityThroughout the film Cruise has some flashbacks depicting a surprise massacre of unarmed Indians by American soldiers, lead by the bad Anglo man. This drives him. Its only one scene and, besides its relevance to Cruise's character, I think the over-arching meaning is to enforce in the audience's mind the dominant narrative of Manifest Destiny as reconstructed by liberal academia, specifically that Indians were little nice people living in a magical world of nature and then puritanical, fanatical, sexually repressed and racist white man came over with his 'technology' and deliberately, gleefully committed genocide against the REAL Native-Americans because they weren't white, raised the Cross, continued the enslavement of women and the consolidation of Capital. Liberal academic then forces us to say that since Indians are the real Native-Americans, itself an ironic example of racism, whites are immigrants and so whites can't oppose unmitigated third-world immigration without being hypocrites and so un-American.In the end, a little Japanese boy close to Cruise asks, ""Are the white men coming for us"". When they come its not white men but bunches of 'civilized' Japanese soldiers of modern technology led by bad Anglo man, so just one white man. I think this question is asked essentially and is where the director decides to explicitly blame whitey, masking the message in the innocence of a cute, persecuted Japanese samurai kid, the thing we've been taught to love.Its worth noticing that bad Anglo man doesn't specifically 'hate' because of racial composition. Rather he makes his distinctions based on civility versus savagery. Civility is modern technology, uniforms, running water, guns, toothpaste, laundry detergent, etc. Savagery is basically the Old World, what we've so idiotically been calling 'culture' for over a century now. So why does he ask the question about Cruise's ""people""? In this place and context people for him still meant whites, though this is after the Civil War, the madness that ensued after Lincoln's assassination and when so-called 'anti-racism' was really coming into its own in America. Is bad Anglo man merely an unconscious racist white man, a Republican party voter, one who promises liberation for all but the moral authority of which is informed by specifically white scruples? Does he mean the GOP notion of 'American' people? If that were true, Anglo man merely used the wrong word. Why not then say Civilization or Progress instead of people?Remember the Japanese samurai boy's question; he didn't mean it literally but essentially. Those modernized Japanese soldiers are just racial Japanese subjected to white drab. This very fact of the question, that its essence depends on recognizing Japanese-ness as being based on race alone, is itself an ironic example of racism, ironic because its used for the purposes of liberal emotional code.Cruse does not respond to these questions in their own language. His ultimate answer comes at the end, when he bows before the Japanese Emperor and offers to commit suicide if it so pleases the Emperor, in the same manner as the Samurai Lord did. Cruise can't tell Anglo man that he hates whites because they're more brutal and eviler than others, as the Samurai Lord Katsumoto himself warmly approves of Custer, beheadings, women in the kitchen and the spoils of war. This is where the multiculturalist fraud is most apparent, but what is Cruise's answer, what does his gesture to the Emperor mean? He submits without question or reason, just because they're right and we're wrong. That's how low white reconstruction engineering has sunk.",3,"an ironic white-guilt trip, amusing beacuse of its incompetance",1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,5969,"['Good', 'news', 'Japanese',

The film has many similarities to Kevin Costner's 'Dances With Wolves' (noted by other astute reviewers); the Civil War is major factor in both central character's state of mind.  Both men choose to side with the natives, rather than the exploitative European culture that spawned them.  Like 'Wolves', this film is bloody and beautifully shot, with large battle sequences.The supporting cast is excellent, with Ken Watanabe simply marvelous as the Samurai Leader, Katsumoto.  I found myself wondering just how this film would have played without the Tom Cruise character- I think just terrific, and would have been solely from the Japanese point of view.  I am dreaming here - Cruise shares producing credits, and the film probably would not have been made without his star power behind it.  Nevertheless, one does get tired of these movies with the 'Great White Hope' leading the way for the natives.The one area I have real doubts about is how quickly the Samurai were to accept a Westerner into their insular society in the film.  This really stretches the imagination - even today, Japan is not exactly eager to bring foreigners within it's inner circles.  Japan was a VERY closed society in 1876, yet we are to believe that the Cruise character literally becomes one of them in a matter of months!The film is beautiful to watch, with spectacular action and realistic battle scenes.  In spite of the obvious plot flaws, the film takes the opportunity to teach the viewer about Japanese culture; one sees the impact on future events (WWII and the Bushido Code, for example).  The final battle is inspiring, with the Spartan stand at Thermopylae being used to rally the Samurai against a clearly superior enemy.All in all, 'The Last Samurai' was enjoyable in spite of it's Hollywood origins.  The whole idea of Tom Cruise as an adopted Japanese Samurai warrior really is farfetched, but somehow I left this film still impressed.  What it really comes down to is the supporting cast - they carried the film.

Watanabe also has a breakthrough role, in which he is part of a group of legendary samurai warriors. This movie is a burrito of action, suspense, and drama all rolled up into one.

The media mania was so high at the release time in the theaters that it seemed by the trailers that this was another massively expensive Epic riding on the Big Name Star vehicle.  Sadly, I avoided seeing this beautiful film on the big screen: now I wish I had not been so influenced by the hype.  THE LAST SAMURAI is at its core a very tender movie, a story of men overcoming their personal demons, of the power of allegiance to ideals, of forgiveness of the past and holding on to honor, of growth of the human spirit and soul.1876, and America lands on the beautiful islands of Japan at the beckon of the Emperor to &quot;Westernize&quot; the country, and the army in particular, to stamp out the historical presence of the Samurai, a band of dedicated, gracefully trained warriors whose purpose was to defend the Emperor - a man believed to be the earthly manifestation of holiness.  The military men sent to perform this transformation are the guilt-ridden, alcoholic Civil War Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) and his commanding officer Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn).  The two attempt to transform the inept army of the emperor's spokesman but when they encounter in battle the Samurai warriors and their leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) they are naturally beaten.  Algren, through his native skills as a fighting man, is captured by the Samurai and is forced to live by their customs in the house of the wife Taka (Koyuki) of a man Algren had killed.  Most of the film is concerned with the gradual spiritual awakening of Algren, his commitment to the Samurai principles of battle and of life and Director Edward Zwick handles this quietly and with great dignity by exploring the growing bond among Algren, Katsumoto, and Taka.  The ultimate confrontational battle between the last of the Samurai and the newly Westernized troops of the Emperors' advisors is not only epic in scale but also mythic in values.The entire cast is excellent and a large cast this is!  But the kudos that have been awarded Watanabe have for some reason not fallen to Cruise.  They are both excellent as are Tony Goldwyn, Koyuki, Timothy Spall, etc.  The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful, the musical score is thoughtfully eloquent, and the BIG scenes are a spectacularly Grand as the intimate scenes are extraordinarily tender.  Sometimes a great film passes us by because of the megalomania of the media hype overpowering the actual film.

You are not learning ANY history at all; you are watching a romantic fantasy about an alternate universe.The message of the movie is that the old ways are better. In some cases, this is true. In the case of feudal Japan, not so much.The Japanese feudal system has been described as a huge con job on the Japanese people, the peasantry in particular. Watching this film, you would have absolutely no clue as to why anyone would say that. It seems like a wonderful place filled with exotic, Eastern customs, honor, and so on.In reality, our whole idea of the samurai is largely mythical ... invented by the samurai themselves to justify their existence and stave off their eventual obsolescence.The whole concept came out of the Tokugawa era, where there was no one to fight. The ""samurai"" were not warriors, but a hereditary, privileged ruling class that imposed tremendous economic burdens on the common people. It was in the 17th century that Bushido was invented out of whole cloth and ""samurai history"" was recast in this fictional light of honor and loyalty.From the actual documentation we have, such as records from the 14th century, it seems that in real battle, precursors to the mythical samurai mostly used pikes and arrows, not swords.Loyalty was pretty much non-existent. Samurai switched sides depending on who paid better. Betrayal was a large part of ""military art""; some clans served both sides to guarantee income. Ritual suicide was mostly done when they were expecting to be executed, but even this was infrequent (until later, when suicide allowed you to pass on your property to your heirs, versus execution).Japan's progress was very much dependent on the phasing out of the samurai. This movie wants to tell us differently.Other reviews are correct that the idea of the white guy mastering their swordplay in such a short time is ridiculous. Not to mention the insult of wearing the widow's husband's armor.But it's beautifully rendered, with some nice (mythical) swordplay.

The historical context of the movie - a very interesting period in Japanese history.The issue that I have with The Last Samurai is that the film does turn into a 'Bwana adventure towards the end. The white guy learns to handle a katana like a pro in a year (ho-ha!), being able to take on Ninjas and trained killers with little difficulty. Then he becomes a general of this rebel army at the same time, due to his vastly superior experience as an American soldier of course. This transition from ""hated enemy"" to ""Bwana"" is always a problem.If it was'nt for all the good stuff in this film that I mentioned earlier, I would recommend giving The Last Samurai a pass, but it is worth watching at least once.",3,"A more respectable ""'Bwana"" movie - 3 1/2 stars..",1097625600,"10 13, 2004",2004,1420,"['usually', 'hate', 'films', 'use', 'formula', 'White', 'guy', 'thrown', 'foriegn', 'non-white', 'American', 'culture', 'leader', 'people', 'culture', '.The', 'White', 'Guy', 'Savage', 'Land', 'motif', 'been', 'used', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'Tarzan', 'movies', 'Hidden', 'movie', 'message', 'black', 'people=Apes', 'Westerns', 'A', 'Man', 'Called', 'Horse', 'TV', 'shows', 'Shogun', 'Doctari', 'Johnny', 'Quest', 'Now', 'GREAT', 'ACTOR', 'Yoda-er', 'um', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'turn', 'playing', 'White', 'Savior', 'Last', 'Samurai', ""'ll"", 'give', 'movie', 'for:1', 'cinematography', 'very', 'nicely', 'done.2', 'Asian', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'physical', 'stunt', 'work', 'convincing', 'manner.3', 'battle', 'were', 'really', 'good.4', 'historical', 'context', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'period', 'Japanese', 'history.The', 'issue', 'have', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'film', 'turn', ""'Bwana"", 'adventure', 'end', 'white', 'guy', 'learns', 'handle', 'katana', 'pro', 'year', 'ho-ha', 'being', 'able', 'take', 'Ninjas', 'trained', 'killers', 'little', 'difficulty', 'Then', 'general', 'rebel', 'army', 'same', 'time', 'due', 'vastly', 'superior', 'experience', 'American', 'soldier', 'course', 'transition', 'hated', 'enemy', 'Bwana', 'always', 'problem.If', 'good', 'stuff', 'film', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'would', 'recommend', 'giving', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'pass', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once']",N/A

In fact, though, the samurai ethos is treated with enough depth, the acting and pacing is excellent, and while there is some sentimental nonsense, it restrains itself more than most films do these days. The final battle is especially impressive - the choreography, the way that deaths of important characters are treated, and some of the images which arouse real pathos.It's still nothing spectacular, though - it never really risks saying anything that hasn't been said before, or presenting some image which hasn't been seen before - but it's probably as good a movie as we could expect to be produced for a mass audience.",4,Surprisingly good,1086307200,"06 4, 2004",2004,994,"['generic-seeming', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'was', 'remarkably', 'true', 'subject', 'matter', 'main', 'concern', 'walking', 'was', 'director', 'would', 'confuse', 'code', 'samurai', 'western', 'ideas', 'courage', 'honor', 'disregarding', 'more', 'morbid', 'side', 'tradition', 'present', 'sentimental', 'parable', 'discovering', 'being', 'good', 'fact', 'though', 'samurai', 'ethos', 'treated', 'enough', 'depth', 'acting', 'pacing', 'excellent', 'sentimental', 'nonsense', 'more', 'most', 'films', 'do', 'days', 'final', 'battle', 'especially', 'impressive', 'choreography', 'way', 'deaths', 'important', 'characters', 'are', 'treated', 'images', 'arouse', 'real', 'pathos.It', 'still', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'never', 'really', 'risks', 'saying', 'anything', ""n't"", 'been', 'said', 'presenting', 'image', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'probably', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'could', 'expect', 'be', 'produced', 'mass', 'audience']",N/A

Welsh ""starmer welshmeister""","[3, 7]","From the opening scene, in which a haunting image is cast of samurai charging headstrong into battle with demonic masks and medieval weaponry, to the severing of a defeated samurai's head, the audience finds itself captivated. Are they merely blood-thirsty savages roaming the hills of Japan, engaging those who choose to deter their beloved nation's lore, or is there more? ""The Last Samurai"" is their story.Tom Cruise, in an Oscar-worthy performance, is Capt. Nathan Algren, a man repelled by his past, a man weeping for redemption.Whether it's the memory of boring holes in fellow countrymen on the knoll of Gettysburg, or his contribution at Sutter's Hill, in which innocent American-Indian women and children were butchered, Algren has become a sideshow drunkard.He now works in the West, exhibiting Winchester rifles and reading off cue cards that glorify the firearm's reputation. Then, a proposition is offered that would quadruple his monthly pay and yield him a shred of honor. His commanding officer beckons his services in the elimination of the unruly samurai who oppose American influence on their native Japan. Algren sets sail to the Far East to instruct the Japanese army on how to fight in a Western fashion and how to modernize the outdated methods of the samurai.Armed with Winchester rifles and superior numbers, though utterly ill-prepared, Algren is sent to engage a seemingly outmatched enemy. However, the combative tactics of the samurai prove too great, as his men are routed and Algren is taken captive by the samurai. Under normal circumstances, it would be taboo for the samurai to hold anyone prisoner, but under strict orders from their leader, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), Algren is to be kept alive.In the beginning of the film, Katsumoto mediates atop a mound overlooking a river valley. He envisions an upcoming battle. In this midst of war, while clashing swords with an opponent, he notices a white streak of fury at his flank. It is a fearsome white tiger with eyes very much like his own.Right away, Katsumoto believes Algren to be this mystical feline that dominates his visions, something the others find hard to believe--particularly, the beautiful Taka (Koyuki), the spouse of the man Algren killed and sister to the fabled Katsumoto; and Higen (Sosuke Ikematsu), a first-rank samurai master.In the process of winning over the companionship of the samurai and learning their language and discipline in the realm of battle, Algren comes to find his true identity. ""There were times on the battlefield where I came to dispute the existence of any sort of god, but there is a soulful enchantment about this place of which I've never known,"" he says.Some critics laughed off this $120 million epic as ""Dances with Sushi"" long before its release. Contending that Cruise was not capable of such a leading role and mocking filmmaker Edward Zwick's directorial credentials as brisk-action livestock fodder, there was an unfair critical bias about this picture while it was still in pre-production. I hope those critics enjoyed their decapitation in shame of defeat, seeing as ""The Last Samurai"" is nothing short of resplendent.",5,`Samurai' is stupendous,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,3160,"['opening', 'scene', 'haunting', 'image', 'cast', 'samurai', 'charging', 'headstrong', 'battle', 'demonic', 'masks', 'medieval', 'weaponry', 'severing', 'defeated', 'samurai', 'head', 'audience', 'captivated', 'Are', 'merely', 'blood-thirsty', 'savages', 'roaming', 'hills', 'Japan', 'engaging', 'who', 'choose', 'deter', 'beloved', 'nation', 'lore', 'there', 'more', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'story.Tom', 'Cruise', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'Capt', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'man', 'repelled', 'past', 'man', 'weeping', 'redemption.Whether', 'memory', 'boring', 'holes', 'fellow', 'countrymen', 'knoll', 'Gettysburg', 'contribution', 'Sutter', 'Hill', 'innocent', 'American-Indian', 'women', 'children', 'were', 'butchered', 'Algren', 'become', 'sideshow', 'drunkard.He', 'now', 'West', 'exhibiting', 'Winchester', 'rifles', 'reading', 'off', 'cue', 'cards', 'glorify', 'firearm', 'reputation', 'Then', 'proposition', 'offered', 'would', 'quadruple', 'monthly', 'pay', 'yield', 'shred', 'honor', 'commanding', 'officer', 'beckons', 'services', 'elimination', 'unruly', 'samurai', 'who', 'oppose', 'American', 'influence', 'native', 'Japan', 'Algren', 'sail', 'Far', 'East', 'instruct', 'Japanese', 'army', 'how', 'fight', 'Western', 'fashion', 'how', 'modernize', 'outdated', 'methods', 'samurai.Armed', 'Winchester', 'rifles', 'superior', 'numbers', 'utterly', 'ill-prepared', 'Algren', 'sent', 'engage', 'seemingly', 'outmatched', 'enemy', 'However', 'combative', 'tactics', 'samurai', 'prove', 'too', 'great', 'men', 'are', 'routed', 'Algren', 'taken', 'captive', 'samurai', 'normal', 'circumstances', 'would', 'be', 'taboo', 'samurai', 'hold', 'anyone', 'prisoner', 'strict', 'orders', 'leader', 'Katsumoto', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Algren', 'be', 'kept', 'beginning', 'film', 'Katsumoto', 'mound', 'overlooking', 'river', 'valley', 'upcoming', 'battle', 'midst', 'war', 'clashing', 'swords', 'opponent', 'white', 'streak', 'fury', 'flank', 'fearsome', 'white', 'tiger', 'eyes', 'very', 'much', 'own.Right', 'away', 'Katsumoto', 'Algren', 'be', 'mystical', 'feline', 'visions', 'something', 'others', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'Taka', 'Koyuki', 'spouse', 'man', 'Algren', 'killed', 'sister', 'fabled', 'Katsumoto', 'Higen', 'Sosuke', 'Ikematsu', 'first-rank', 'samurai', 'master.In', 'process', 'winning', 'companionship', 'samurai', 'learning', 'language', 'discipline', 'realm', 'battle', 'Algren', 'find', 'true', 'identity', 'were', 'times', 'battlefield', 'where', 'came', 'dispute', 'existence', 'sort', 'god', 'soulful', 'enchantment', 'place', ""'ve"", 'never', 'known', 'says.Some', 'critics', 'laughed', 'off', '120', 'million', 'epic', 'Dances', 'Sushi', 'long', 'release', 'Contending', 'Cruise', 'was', 'not', 'capable', 'leading', 'role', 'mocking', 'filmmaker', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'directorial', 'credentials', 'brisk-action', 'livestock', 'fodder', 'was', 'unfair', 'critical', 'bias', 'picture', 'was', 'still', 'pre-production', 'hope', 'critics', 'enjoyed', 'decapitation', 'shame', 'defeat', 'seeing', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'nothing', 'short', 'resplendent']",N/A

My view veers toward the former as all I was left with after having see the film is this feeling: Haven't I seen this before? In a word, what's the difference between Dance With Wolves and this one? Seen as a historical epic, this is positively bad. How those fully armoured warriors could exist in the mid nineteenth century Japan is anyone's guess, not to mention the Ninjya. Isn't this familiar? There was something of a vogue for things Japanese in the 80s when Miyamoto Musashi's Book of Five Rings was a big hit. Well, there were a bunch of Japan bashers too, given the economic imbalance that existed between the two countries back then. Things probably look a bit different now as Japan is positively seen as a U.S. ally or a partner in crime, depending on how you look at it, as the U.S. vows to dust all ""bad"" regimes off the face of the planet.

I then bought it and watched it  again.  I became immersed in it more deeply each time, realizing that there is a great deal of subtlety and depth not obtainable from an initial viewing.  From the strength of the superb supporting characters, to the gradual changing of cruise's character, and the details of the time re-created so credibly by the filmmakers, this was an excellent film of substance, not traditionally done by hollywood.While i have seen Dances with wolves, as others have complained about the lack of originality of the storyline, i feel that not to be completely accurate.  I also feel cruise's portrayal was more convincing than Costner's, and that this film is of equal power and effectiveness.  There are, like all films, weaknesses, such as the lack of exploration of the samurai's rejection of modernity, (a deleted scene on disc 2 touches upon this), and the dialogue can be a bit lacking, such as the exchange between katsumoto and the emperor as to how the situation should be handled, these are minor in the grand epic that is the last samurai.  Watch it with an open mind, and scrutinize the background/secondary characters, all of whom - especially ujio - were excellent.

Japan was modernized at first to the best profit of the USA. But this development brought strong resistance within Japan from the feudal order of the Samourais, and a very agressive expansion on the Asian continent. This film concentrates on the final push against feudalism and its old code of honor represented by the Samourais. This change was particularly brutal with imported weapons from the USA, an exclusive contract, and military counsellors. The move was led by some big capitalist families who were ruthless about the change and who violently eradicated all opposition to the final death of it and them. The film shows this very well. The character Tom Cruise embodies here is probably fictitious but it links the wars against the Indians in the US to this war against mountain tribes and villages in Japan. The same objective : to impose industrial development in an extremely egotistic way : no honor, no real democracy, no concertation. Just change, and profits for a few. The film is short on one issue : this forced change led the new industrial aristocracy to an expansion that was carried out through war and the use of brutal force. Japan needed new markets and new workers. They found them in Formosa, in China, in Manchuria, in Korea, and they even tried to conquer Siberia. We know what that process led to forty years later. We should never force foreign countries to change too fast and along a ruthless profit-minded road because profit knows no obstacles, and frustration leads to a need for historical compensation, and sooner or later the two come together. Any country should have the right to change at its own rhythm and along its own logic.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,We have to let people change all by themselves,1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,1855,"['opening', 'Japan', '1853', 'pressure', 'US', 'Perry', 'expedition', 'restoration', 'Imperial', 'power', '1867', 'things', 'went', 'very', 'fast', 'Japan', 'was', 'modernized', 'first', 'best', 'profit', 'USA', 'development', 'brought', 'strong', 'resistance', 'Japan', 'feudal', 'order', 'Samourais', 'very', 'agressive', 'expansion', 'Asian', 'continent', 'film', 'final', 'push', 'feudalism', 'old', 'code', 'honor', 'represented', 'Samourais', 'change', 'was', 'particularly', 'brutal', 'imported', 'weapons', 'USA', 'exclusive', 'contract', 'military', 'counsellors', 'move', 'was', 'led', 'big', 'capitalist', 'families', 'who', 'were', 'ruthless', 'change', 'who', 'violently', 'eradicated', 'opposition', 'final', 'death', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'character', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'embodies', 'here', 'probably', 'fictitious', 'wars', 'Indians', 'US', 'war', 'mountain', 'tribes', 'villages', 'Japan', 'same', 'objective', 'impose', 'industrial', 'development', 'extremely', 'egotistic', 'way', 'honor', 'real', 'democracy', 'concertation', 'Just', 'change', 'profits', 'few', 'film', 'short', 'one', 'issue', 'forced', 'change', 'led', 'new', 'industrial', 'aristocracy', 'expansion', 'was', 'carried', 'out', 'war', 'use', 'brutal', 'force', 'Japan', 'needed', 'new', 'markets', 'new', 'workers', 'found', 'Formosa', 'China', 'Manchuria', 'Korea', 'even', 'tried', 'conquer', 'Siberia', 'know', 'what', 'process', 'led', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'should', 'never', 'force', 'foreign', 'countries', 'change', 'too', 'fast', 'ruthless', 'profit-minded', 'road', 'profit', 'obstacles', 'frustration', 'need', 'historical', 'compensation', 'sooner', 'later', 'two', 'come', 'together', 'Any', 'country', 'should', 'have', 'right', 'change', 'own', 'rhythm', 'own', 'logic.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

I was very excited to hear this movie was coming out. I not only admire Edward Zwick's other movies but I am a Tom Cruise fan as well. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the movie, Tom Cruise was fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful but the film is almost completely ""factless"". America did open up trade with Japan but French and German officers trained the Japanese imperial army, They at the time had the best Foot soldiers. Also the young Emperor of Japan was not torn between the new and old ways, He instead was the driving force behind modernizing Japan as fast as it did, he saw the Samurai as one of the main reasons Japan had fallen so far behind. The Samurai that rebelled against the Emperor were considered ""RONIN"" meaning Samurai with no master, and sense Samurai means ""To serve"" they were despised by the Samurai that served the Emperor and were perceived as Dishonorable. The rebel Samurai also had full divisions that used Firearms, it was not the Bows vs. Rifles you see in the movie. And most importantly it was not the Honorable Samurai protecting the Peasant people from the heartless new way of the Evil imperial Japanese Government, quit the opposite is true. Japan had been divided for more then a century, the clans had known nothing but war. When the Shogun took power the Emperor was nothing more then a symbol and was never allowed to leave his Palace. The Shogun had the real power and the whole time it was most of Japan, the peasants and working class that suffered under the Samurai, They were Honorable warriors but only to other Samurai, ordinary Japanese were considered Less then Men and could be killed at the whims of the Samurai. It was the modernization of Japan that threatened the rule of the Samurai with the Shogun being forced to step down in 1867 and put the power back in the hands of the Emperor as well as the working class of Japan. Most Samurai saw this and surrendered the old way to the new seeing that The Samurai were obsolete, but the few that rebelled were motivated by Power, status and wealth that they were losing and not for the People of Japan like the film so badly suggests. This is a fun film if you watch it as a fantasy adventure with no basis in history. I give it a low rating because even thought both Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick admit that this is not what really happened but wanted to capture the spirit of the Samurai in a fiction film, I feel this is irresponsible and that this film dishonors The real history of Japan. I would like to add that the Chinese feel Honoring the Samurai and Japanese values is like Honoring Nazis and their way of life and I don't blame them for feeling that way considering there History.",1,"""Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure""",1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,2858,"['Not', 'Real', 'History', 'A', 'Fun', 'Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'March', '4', '2004', 'Not', 'Real', 'History', 'A', 'Fun', 'Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'simple', 'way', 'describe', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'hear', 'movie', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'admire', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'other', 'movies', 'am', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'fantastic', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'film', 'almost', 'completely', 'factless', 'America', 'did', 'open', 'up', 'trade', 'Japan', 'French', 'German', 'officers', 'trained', 'Japanese', 'imperial', 'army', 'time', 'had', 'best', 'Foot', 'soldiers', 'Also', 'young', 'Emperor', 'Japan', 'was', 'not', 'torn', 'new', 'old', 'ways', 'instead', 'was', 'driving', 'force', 'modernizing', 'Japan', 'as', 'fast', 'did', 'saw', 'Samurai', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'Japan', 'had', 'fallen', 'so', 'far', 'Samurai', 'rebelled', 'Emperor', 'were', 'considered', 'RONIN', 'meaning', 'Samurai', 'master', 'sense', 'Samurai', 'serve', 'were', 'despised', 'Samurai', 'served', 'Emperor', 'were', 'perceived', 'Dishonorable', 'rebel', 'Samurai', 'also', 'had', 'full', 'divisions', 'used', 'Firearms', 'was', 'not', 'Bows', 'vs', 'Rifles', 'see', 'movie', 'most', 'importantly', 'was', 'not', 'Honorable', 'Samurai', 'protecting', 'Peasant', 'people', 'heartless', 'new', 'way', 'Evil', 'imperial', 'Japanese', 'Government', 'quit', 'opposite', 'true', 'Japan', 'had', 'been', 'divided', 'more', 'then', 'century', 'clans', 'had', 'known', 'nothing', 'war', 'When', 'Shogun', 'took', 'power', 'Emperor', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', 'symbol', 'was', 'never', 'allowed', 'leave', 'Palace', 'Shogun', 'had', 'real', 'power', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'most', 'Japan', 'peasants', 'working', 'class', 'suffered', 'Samurai', 'were', 'Honorable', 'warriors', 'only', 'other', 'Samurai', 'ordinary', 'Japanese', 'were', 'considered', 'Less', 'then', 'Men', 'could', 'be', 'killed', 'whims', 'Samurai', 'was', 'modernization', 'Japan', 'threatened', 'rule', 'Samurai', 'Shogun', 'being', 'forced', 'step', 'down', '1867', 'put', 'power', 'back', 'hands', 'Emperor', 'as', 'well', 'working', 'class', 'Japan', 'Most', 'Samurai', 'saw', 'surrendered', 'old', 'way', 'new', 'seeing', 'Samurai', 'were', 'obsolete', 'few', 'rebelled', 'were', 'motivated', 'Power', 'status', 'wealth', 'were', 'losing', 'not', 'People', 'Japan', 'film', 'so', 'badly', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'basis', 'history', 'give', 'low', 'rating', 'even', 'thought', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'admit', 'not', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'wanted', 'capture', 'spirit', 'Samurai', 'fiction', 'film', 'feel', 'irresponsible', 'film', 'real', 'history', 'Japan', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'Chinese', 'feel', 'Honoring', 'Samurai', 'Japanese', 'values', 'Honoring', 'Nazis', 'way', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'feeling', 'way', 'considering', 'there', 'History']",N/A

I'd go in depth about the movie and everything, but why repeat what everyone else said? The thing to remember is this movie is rated pretty high cause it has intense battle scenes that resemble gladiator in its gruesome display of battle lust (not that I have anything against that). The one part I didn't like but is understandable since it has japenese actors in it is that halfway through the movie they start talking in japenese and you have to read the bottom of the screen to see what they say. Now if its 2am and your tired and sitting far from the tv, that can be a problem but as i said, cruise is in japan at that time so he should speak the language as well. Just in case anyone did miss it, basically cruise is the last man left in his unit when its taken out by japanese samurais. they spare him and hold him captive in their village. soon he embraces their culture and starts to find a little peace in himself.

Almost everyone you care about gets killed.Samurai were feudal lords who occasionally battled the Emperors and those that controlled the emperor.  The fight scenes and the cinematography are at times awesome.  Cruise is very creditable in his role as a disillusioned X-army Captain who had been with the seventh cavalry, presumably with Reno's force after Custer divided his force into three groups, hence he survived.  Cruise goes to Japan to teach the Emperors army how to use modern western weapons, gets captured and ends up sympathetic to his captures cause.  Patty Hurst Syndrome?It is a little bit like the Last of the Mohicans or the Thirteenth Warrior.  The viewer is left with a an empty feeling and of course the bad guys are the Americans.Once one gets past the politics of the makers of the movie and the inaccurate historical presentation it's a pretty good movie for those old enough for an R rating.  This is not a sword fight movie to watch with ones 10 year old.  Heads fly, blood spurts and at times the story bogs down into the maudlin and smarmy.There is probably a 5 star movie inside this otherwise 3 star movie, if they'd let me edit it down to 90 or 100 minutes, removing the moderate use of cursing, the really boring moments that contribute little to the story line, blood spurting and the beheadings.  For a better sword action movie with sharp editing and a great screen play, check out Antonio Banderas in the Thirteenth Warrior.  13th is still not a movie for your 10 year old, but that is more because it creates a scariness and feeling of dread about what the Warriors are up against.",3,"Good action movie, but not family friendly.",1085097600,"05 21, 2004",2004,1684,"['Last', 'Samurai', 'movie', 'great', 'action', 'sadness', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'care', 'killed.Samurai', 'were', 'feudal', 'lords', 'who', 'occasionally', 'battled', 'Emperors', 'controlled', 'emperor', 'fight', 'scenes', 'cinematography', 'are', 'times', 'awesome', 'Cruise', 'very', 'creditable', 'role', 'disillusioned', 'X-army', 'Captain', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'seventh', 'cavalry', 'presumably', 'Reno', 'force', 'Custer', 'divided', 'force', 'three', 'groups', 'hence', 'survived', 'Cruise', 'Japan', 'teach', 'Emperors', 'army', 'how', 'use', 'modern', 'western', 'weapons', 'captured', 'up', 'sympathetic', 'captures', 'cause', 'Patty', 'Hurst', 'Syndrome', 'little', 'bit', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Thirteenth', 'Warrior', 'viewer', 'left', 'empty', 'feeling', 'course', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'Americans.Once', 'one', 'politics', 'makers', 'movie', 'inaccurate', 'historical', 'presentation', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'old', 'enough', 'R', 'rating', 'not', 'sword', 'fight', 'movie', 'watch', 'ones', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Heads', 'fly', 'blood', 'spurts', 'times', 'story', 'bogs', 'down', 'maudlin', 'smarmy.There', 'probably', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'otherwise', '3', 'star', 'movie', ""'d"", 'let', 'edit', 'down', '90', '100', 'minutes', 'removing', 'moderate', 'use', 'cursing', 'really', 'boring', 'moments', 'contribute', 'little', 'story', 'line', 'blood', 'spurting', 'beheadings', 'better', 'sword', 'action', 'movie', 'sharp', 'editing', 'great', 'screen', 'play', 'check', 'out', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Thirteenth', 'Warrior', '13th', 'still', 'not', 'movie', '10', 'year', 'old', 'more', 'scariness', 'feeling', 'dread', 'what', 'Warriors', 'are', 'up']",N/A

Well, as usual, I missed it in the theaters but recently enjoyed it on DVD (thankfully, DVDs are now being released just months after the movie is on the big screen!)I liked this movie a lot. The cinematography was gorgeous. The acting ranged from good to excellent. Yes, the story was the same as any number of other movies, but so what? How often do we see a truly original movie storyline thse days? The treatment of the samurai and bushido was excellent, and the final battle (samurai vs cannons and guns) was truly horrific.A few negatives - Algren was far too proficient after just a few months of training. But I suppose this is akin to Daniel-san training with Miyagi-sensei for a few months and then defeating the tournament champion... I can stand it. I did feel the ending was a total cop-out, and weakened the horror of the final battle. (spoilers ahead!) Algren should have died with the samurai. It would have been equally believeable to have the emperor decide on a new course for Japan based on reports of the deaths of Katsumoto and the samurai (perhaps after seeing the photos taken) and much more powerful to see the Taka and the villagers mourning the loss of the samurai and their way of life. But then again, many people would have found such a realistic but unhappy ending distasteful and perhaps they have a point - sometimes we need to watch movies to escape reality, not be reminded of it.

Times are a-changing in the Land of the Rising Sun: in the fervour of the Meiji Restoration, everything Western is very much &quot;in&quot; which, sadly, means that the game's up for the country's samurai, who have kept the nation in a vicegrip for the past few centuries. Some, however, aren't willing to go down without a fight, and so it is that Algren finds himself, in command of a motley and ill-trained force, facing-off against rogue samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Suffice to say that things don't go entirely as planned, and Algren finds himself defeated and taken hostage by Katsumoto's samurai band. His captivity, though, proves to be the source of his redemption, as he adopts the customs of the samurai and ultimately joins them in their final stand against the Imperial forces.It's all a bit Dances With Wolves but, although The Last Samurai isn't in the same league as that movie, it remains an engaging and watchable, albeit flawed, epic. Those hoping for an authentic depiction of pre-modern Japan should look elsewhere (Akira Kurosawa's films, and the recent Twilight Samurai, would be good places to start) - this is samurai culture re-tailored for a Hollywood audience. The samurai are depicted as peace-loving folk, with no reference made to the crushing feudal regime they imposed; meanwhile, Watanabe's Katsumoto, despite being vehemently opposed to the Western forces encroaching on his beloved country, speaks fluent English - a tad ridiculous, to say the least. The idyllic village to which Cruise's character is whisked away looks more like something out of Lord of the Rings - indeed, much of The Last Samurai was filmed in New Zealand; the country vistas look nothing like Japan, past or present.All of this didn't stop the film from winning-over much of the native audience here, mind you, leaving only us gaijin to scoff at the inconsistencies. When you compare it to the likes of Braveheart and Gladiator, too, it starts to feel a little unfair to chastise The Last Samurai for the numerous historical liberties it takes. Hey, at least the Japanese characters actually speak some Japanese.If you can overlook the inaccuracies (and I'm sure the average viewer would be happy to), The Last Samurai is a pretty entertaining watch. Cruise turns in a decent performance - moody, strained, with the faintest whiff of trying-too-hard - but it's Watanabe who provides the most compelling screen presence. His Katsumoto is a dignified, commanding figure, whose commitment to the ancient Bushido samurai code (which, with its &quot;let's rush headlong towards a bloody and unnecessary death!&quot; mantra, is more than a little unpalatable to Western audiences) seems utterly believable. Director Edward Zwick comes up with some exhilirating set pieces, too: the final battle is well-staged, but it's a ninja assault on Katsumoto's village midway through the film that leaves the most lasting impression.The Last Samurai is by no means a great movie: it's too long by far, the introduction of a love interest is painfully contrived, and - crucially - it doesn't pack the emotional punch that Kevin Costner managed in Dances With Wolves. The death of the samurai culture was, let's face it, neither as tragic nor as unfair as that of the Native Americans - Zwick and co may try to have us believe otherwise, but it's a disingenuous pitch, to say the least. What you're left with is a handsome and entertaining movie - a bit hollow at the core, maybe, but well worth a watch.",3,"Watchable stuff (you can save the hara kiri for later, Tom)",1087862400,"06 22, 2004",2004,3690,"['Captain', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'washed-up', 'Civil', 'War', 'vet', 'tormented', 'guilt', 'swimming', 'fug', 'alcoholism', 'recruited', 'train', 'modernise', 'Japanese', 'Imperial', 'Army', 'Times', 'are', 'a-changing', 'Land', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'fervour', 'Meiji', 'Restoration', 'everything', 'Western', 'very', 'much', 'quot', 'quot', 'sadly', 'game', 'up', 'country', 'samurai', 'who', 'have', 'kept', 'nation', 'vicegrip', 'past', 'few', 'centuries', 'however', 'are', ""n't"", 'willing', 'go', 'down', 'fight', 'Algren', 'command', 'motley', 'ill-trained', 'force', 'facing-off', 'rogue', 'samurai', 'leader', 'Katsumoto', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Suffice', 'say', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'entirely', 'planned', 'Algren', 'defeated', 'taken', 'hostage', 'Katsumoto', 'samurai', 'band', 'captivity', 'though', 'be', 'source', 'redemption', 'customs', 'samurai', 'ultimately', 'final', 'stand', 'Imperial', 'forces.It', 'bit', 'Wolves', 'Last', 'Samurai', ""n't"", 'same', 'league', 'movie', 'engaging', 'watchable', 'albeit', 'flawed', 'epic', 'hoping', 'authentic', 'depiction', 'pre-modern', 'Japan', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'films', 'recent', 'Twilight', 'Samurai', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'places', 'start', 'samurai', 'culture', 're-tailored', 'Hollywood', 'audience', 'samurai', 'are', 'depicted', 'peace-loving', 'folk', 'reference', 'made', 'crushing', 'feudal', 'regime', 'imposed', 'meanwhile', 'Watanabe', 'Katsumoto', 'being', 'vehemently', 'opposed', 'Western', 'forces', 'encroaching', 'beloved', 'country', 'fluent', 'English', 'tad', 'ridiculous', 'say', 'least', 'idyllic', 'village', 'Cruise', 'character', 'whisked', 'away', 'more', 'something', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'indeed', 'much', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'was', 'filmed', 'New', 'Zealand', 'country', 'vistas', 'look', 'nothing', 'Japan', 'past', 'present.All', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'film', 'winning-over', 'much', 'native', 'audience', 'here', 'mind', 'leaving', 'only', 'gaijin', 'scoff', 'inconsistencies', 'When', 'compare', 'likes', 'Braveheart', 'Gladiator', 'too', 'feel', 'little', 'unfair', 'chastise', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'numerous', 'historical', 'liberties', 'Hey', 'least', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'actually', 'speak', 'Japanese.If', 'can', 'overlook', 'inaccuracies', ""'m"", 'sure', 'average', 'viewer', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Cruise', 'decent', 'performance', 'moody', 'strained', 'faintest', 'whiff', 'trying-too-hard', 'Watanabe', 'who', 'most', 'compelling', 'screen', 'presence', 'Katsumoto', 'dignified', 'commanding', 'figure', 'commitment', 'ancient', 'Bushido', 'samurai', 'code', 'quot', 'rush', 'headlong', 'bloody', 'unnecessary', 'death', 'quot', 'more', 'little', 'unpalatable', 'Western', 'audiences', 'utterly', 'believable', 'Director', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'up', 'exhilirating', 'set', 'pieces', 'too', 'final', 'battle', 'well-staged', 'ninja', 'assault', 'Katsumoto', 'village', 'midway', 'film', 'most', 'lasting', 'impression.The', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'great', 'movie', 'too', 'long', 'far', 'introduction', 'love', 'interest', 'painfully', 'contrived', 'crucially', ""n't"", 'pack', 'emotional', 'punch', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'managed', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'death', 'samurai', 'culture', 'was', 'let', 'face', 'tragic', 'as', 'unfair', 'Native', 'Americans', 'Zwick', 'co', 'may', 'try', 'have', 'believe', 'otherwise', 'disingenuous', 'pitch', 'say', 'least', 'What', ""'re"", 'left', 'handsome', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'bit', 'hollow', 'core', 'maybe', 'well', 'watch']",N/A
808156,A1D1SP3AOXDP4H,B0001JXOUS,Jimmy Lin,"[6, 7]","To someone who's actually studied a little Asian history, this was an enjoyable but weird film to watch.  Let me present this scenario:An American of Eastern European descent makes a movie in which a Polish Jew becomes a disciple of Prof. Ernst Haeckel, noted zoologist and early proponent of ideas associated with Nazism: racial war, that Germans were the most superior race of all, and complete suppression of any opposing viewpoints.Wouldn't that strike you as strange?And yet that's pretty much what you get with ""The Last Samurai"" - an American movie based on the Meiji-era Satsuma rebellion led by Saigo Takamori, an Imperial loyalist who advocated a return to traditional Japanese values and (incidentally) the military conquest of Asia to establish an all-encompassing Japanese empire loyal to the divine emporer.Do Saigo's values sound familiar?  They should.  The Japanese role in WWII was founded on similar notions.So in order to create a viable and sympathetic ""Last Samurai,"" director Zawick and screenwriter Logan created a fictional Katsumoto to replace the historical Saigo.  This way, they were able to focus on a pastoral outlook of samurai life and discipline - which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  In doing so, they created a very pretty film filled with very pretty images and highly sterilized ideas.  What's bad about it is that the film warps history (badly) and is filled with countless cliche's - sakura blossoms, seppuku, calligraphy, etc.The plot is essentially ""an American faced with the horrible reality of his Western way of life abandons his roots and finds truth in another culture.""  Captain Algren, scarred by his role in the Indian Wars, accepts a commision from a big-business-controlled Meiji emporer to train the Japanese army (recently armed by the US) and to take out a band of rebel samurai.  These samurai are led by Katsumoto, a samurai of impeccable honor who opposes the Westernization of Japan because of its corruptive influence.  Algren is taken prisoner by Katsumoto and comes around to his captor's viewpoint during his captivity.  He joins Katsumoto's rebellion and learns bushido, the ""way of the warrior.""  In a final all-out onslaught, Algren and Katsumoto lead the rebel bunch into a battle against the new Westernized Japanese army.  The rebels are slaughtered, and Katsumoto, mortally wounded, commits seppuku while commenting on the perfection of cherry blossoms.  The young Meiji emporer, on hearing the manner in which this loyal samurai perished, rejects Westernism and gives all of the evil businessman's money to the people.  Algren returns to Katsumoto's village, apparently to live out the rest of his days as in pastoral rural peace.Could we get any more cliche'?It's a great piece of eye- and mind-candy - the shining highpoint in the century-long Western infatuation with Far Eastern culture.  It's a lovesong to the romantic ideas of Orientalism - a throwback to the days when American housewives wore kimonos and played mah-jong.  It's the same myopic viewpoint that helped make Bruce Lee the myth he is today, rather than the footnote that he deserved to be.  It's a fable that expounds the ideals of bushido, rather than directly face the full gamut of samurai life.  The rolling shots of New Zealand (why not shoot the movie in Japan?) are gorgeous, the swordplay is gracefully violent, and the natural earth- and woodtones are so peaceful and Zen-like.  This movie is perfectly marketed to an American audience still flirting with Zen, to whom green tea flavoring is trendy, and who buy Japenese paper lamps sold at IKEA.I can certainly understand reviewer ""minnanouta's"" violent reaction to the film, although I don't share it.  Koreans in particular are bound to hate this movie, given the invasion they suffered during WWII - an invasion once designed and supported by the real ""Last Samurai.""  Americans and Europeans, still in the throes of ""yellow fever,"" will love this flick.  Other Asians will scratch their heads, go ""hmmm,"" and say, ""Oh, Americans made this movie.  That makes sense, sort of.""This could have been a great movie, had it presented balanced viewpoints from both Katsumoto and the industrial tycoon who opposed him.  Had this film actually portrayed history, it could have been wonderful - the ambiguities and impurities to both sides of a tenacious struggle in which there is no one correct way.  The Meiji Restoration was a tumultuous period in Japanese history, and the struggles of the period were highly layered and complex.Instead, Zawick and Logan gave us a fable and a fairy tale, and so their historical narrative is severely weakened.  It's a gross over-simplification of something very real and very relevant to modern times - but it's eye-catching and well-photographed, so it gets two stars.  Add one star for the wonderful screen presence of Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto, the one character in the movie anyone cared about.If you're interested in more accurate portrayals of Japanese and samurai life, I suggest any of the Kurasawa samurai epics.  Jim Jarmusch's ""Ghost Dog"" is an interesting modern meditation of bushido, and many arthouse Yakuza flicks deal with issues of honor and loyalty in grittier, more human terms (check out ""Beat"" Takeshi's ""Brother"").For great samurai reads get the Dark Horse reprints of ""Lone Wolf and Cub,"" Eiji Yoshikawa's ""Musashi,"" and Yukio Mishima's ""Patriotism.""[Edit]  An infinitely better depiction of the Japanese samurai spirit is ""Letters from Iwo Jima.""  Sure, there are no pretty sakura blossoms, kimono, or katana duels - but the values so prized by the samurai - loyalty, bravery, and sacrifice - are displayed in a Thermopylae-type last stand by soldiers who knew that they were likely to die in order to buy time for their homeland.[note:  since this review was originally posted, ""minnanouta"" has rewritten his/her review.

808157,A31VRNV75GSXNR,B0001JXOUS,Jim Spencer,"[3, 5]","I loved the movie myself. Great camera work, nice action scenes, and alot of drama. I think many people would benefit from watching the old 70's movie Shogun.I think Cruise did a fine job. Was he ""striving for an Oscar""? Don't know. Don't care. Why not let the movie and actors stand for themselves? Does he have the same personality in all his movies? Well, yah, sorta. But I'm sorry so do most actors that people think are great. I love Anthony Hopkins myself, but he always seems the same. The only actor (another that I love) I can think of off the top of my head that is actually different in some of his movies is Gary Oldman and that's stretching it a bit.I liked the relationship between Cruise and the people of the village. He saw them as savages, and they saw him the same way. The ""relationship"" with his hostess didn't seem strained to me. She hated him because he was an unwashed savage that killed her husband, but as time progressed, no one could deny his trying not only to fit in but to not back down (which is something they would appreciate). And, he got on well with her kids. Call me chauvanistic here, but any man that is good with a woman's kids will hit a soft spot. And, there was no ""Take me, Cruise!!!"" scene at all in the movie. I don't see the problem. Also, he never was samurai. He appreciated their culture but admittedly didn't understand alot of it which is... understandable.As to the final part of the movie being overly done hollywood... I think SOMEONE had to survive. Someone had to bring this to the emperor's face and show it in a personal way. When you think about it, Algren was the only option for this. Was it cliche'? Sure. But, had it just ended with them all dying, there would have been no resolution. Perhaps had the emperor been there to see it... then I would say you could just leave it at all the men dying and the emperor being moved by it, but he wasn't. So, someone had to bring this to him. It couldn't be Katsumoto, because he (and his sword) was the message itself. It couldn't have been the other samurai, because to do such a thing would have been not their place and disrespectful (culture gaps here). The only person who could to this, and get away with it, was Algren. He was NOT a samurai (and don't be confused into thinking  The Last Samurai"" referred to him, because it didn't. It referred to Katsumoto.), AND he represented a third party perspective. That was the clincher. The act moved an ""honorless white man"" (culture gap again) to come before the emperor and even offer to end his life in some accordance to the Bushido code. It WAS moving.And it wasn't saying that by becoming ""modernized"" the Japanese were doing wrong (as a reviewer put it). It was attempting to demonstrate and correct the attitude: the Western culture is better than ours and we must imitate them like a boy imitates his father. THAT'S what Katsumoto was fighting against. You don't have to sterilize your current culture to move forward. Recognize what you have and are and move forward with pride in those things. Don't become a lapdog to cultures who see you as an oddity of backwards savages. Strive for mutual respect.Anyhow, I found the movie to be both entertaining and moving.",5,4.5 but that's not an option.,1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,3232,"['loved', 'movie', 'Great', 'camera', 'work', 'nice', 'action', 'scenes', 'alot', 'drama', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'benefit', 'watching', 'old', '70', 'movie', 'Shogun.I', 'think', 'Cruise', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'Was', 'striving', 'Oscar', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Why', 'not', 'let', 'movie', 'actors', 'stand', 'have', 'same', 'personality', 'movies', 'Well', 'yah', 'sorta', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'so', 'do', 'most', 'actors', 'people', 'think', 'are', 'great', 'love', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'always', 'same', 'only', 'actor', 'love', 'can', 'think', 'top', 'head', 'actually', 'different', 'movies', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'stretching', 'bit.I', 'liked', 'relationship', 'Cruise', 'people', 'village', 'saw', 'savages', 'saw', 'same', 'way', 'relationship', 'hostess', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'strained', 'hated', 'was', 'unwashed', 'savage', 'killed', 'husband', 'time', 'progressed', 'one', 'could', 'deny', 'trying', 'not', 'only', 'fit', 'not', 'back', 'down', 'something', 'would', 'appreciate', 'got', 'well', 'kids', 'Call', 'chauvanistic', 'here', 'man', 'good', 'woman', 'kids', 'will', 'hit', 'soft', 'spot', 'was', 'Take', 'Cruise', 'scene', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'problem', 'Also', 'never', 'was', 'samurai', 'appreciated', 'culture', 'admittedly', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'alot', 'understandable.As', 'final', 'part', 'movie', 'being', 'overly', 'done', 'hollywood', 'think', 'SOMEONE', 'had', 'survive', 'Someone', 'had', 'bring', 'emperor', 'face', 'show', 'personal', 'way', 'When', 'think', 'Algren', 'was', 'only', 'option', 'Was', 'cliche', 'Sure', 'had', 'just', 'ended', 'dying', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'resolution', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'emperor', 'been', 'there', 'see', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'could', 'just', 'leave', 'men', 'dying', 'emperor', 'being', 'moved', 'was', ""n't"", 'So', 'someone', 'had', 'bring', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'Katsumoto', 'sword', 'was', 'message', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'other', 'samurai', 'do', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'place', 'disrespectful', 'culture', 'gaps', 'here', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'was', 'Algren', 'was', 'NOT', 'samurai', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'confused', 'thinking', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'referred', 'did', ""n't"", 'referred', 'Katsumoto', 'represented', 'third', 'party', 'perspective', 'was', 'clincher', 'act', 'moved', 'honorless', 'white', 'man', 'culture', 'gap', 'again', 'come', 'emperor', 'even', 'offer', 'end', 'life', 'accordance', 'Bushido', 'code', 'WAS', 'moving.And', 'was', ""n't"", 'saying', 'becoming', 'modernized', 'Japanese', 'were', 'doing', 'wrong', 'reviewer', 'put', 'was', 'attempting', 'demonstrate', 'correct', 'attitude', 'Western', 'culture', 'better', 'ours', 'must', 'imitate', 'boy', 'father', 'what', 'Katsumoto', 'was', 'fighting', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sterilize', 'current', 'culture', 'move', 'forward', 'Recognize', 'what', 'have', 'are', 'move', 'forward', 'pride', 'things', 'Do', ""n't"", 'become', 'lapdog', 'cultures', 'who', 'see', 'oddity', 'backwards', 'savages', 'Strive', 'mutual', 'respect.Anyhow', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'entertaining', 'moving']",N/A

Be prepared to suspend all disbelief for2 1/2 hours for this film. Drunken, guilt-ridden, Indian War veteran is hired by Japanese government to stamp out  rebellion, gets captured, dries out, and over the course of a few months becomes a disciplined, fierce, Zen-like Samurai warrior. In his spare time he becomes fluent in Japanese. He switches sides, becomes a master tactician, kills countless Japanese soldiers and a few Americans along the way, and lives to tell the tale.The scenery was nice, the Japanese actors terrific, and thankfully the incipient love affair wasn't allowed to blossom on screen, which would have violated every norm of Japanese culture of the time. Maybe I'm taking it too seriously, but the notion that a Westerner could enter this proud, ancient culture with such relative ease seemed almost disrespectful to me.

Officially, he is also a hero in the fight against the American Indians, but Algren is tormented by what happened.  He has nightmares and flashbacks of the slaughter of the Indians.  He is selling his story as a stage act (with the intent to sell rifles for the company putting on the show), but is trying to bury his memory in whiskey.Algren is contacted by his former military commander, whom he hates with a passion because of the Indian slaughter.  His commander has an offer for him from the Japanese.  Algren is being recruited to train Japanese soldiers in modern warfare.  Japan is trying to modernize and step away from some of its past traditions.  To be specific, Japan is trying to separate from the Samurai tradition.  The Japanese military is also trying to put down a rebellion from Samurai rebels who claim that Japan's modernization is happening too fast.  Algren accepts the position (the money is good), and begins to train the Japanese.  Even though they are making improvements, they are not yet ready for battle when they are commanded to fight against Katsumoto's (Ken Watanabe) Samurai rebels.  The Samurai soundly defeat the army in the battle as the army is so undisciplined that they break ranks at the first charge.  Algren is isolated and is fighting for his life.  When Algren can fight no longer, one of the Samurai is prepared to kill him, but Katsumoto decides to take Algren prisoner.  Even though it took some time to get here, this is where the movie truly begins.Algren is in the care of Katsumoto's sister, Taka (Koyuki).  We are taken on a journey with Algren as he is nursed back into health but still deals with the scars of his past.  Algren must spend the winter as a prisoner because when the snow falls, there is no way out of the village.  During this time, Algren learns about the samurai through conversations with Katsumoto and he begins to come to peace with himself.  There also seems to be a gentle love interest forming between Algren and Taka, but so much of it is unspoken and shown throw gesture and glances.I thought this was a beautiful movie.  The cinematography was just stunning and while the film may have had a slower pacing, I found it incredibly engaging.  Edward Zwick is the director of the underrated ""Courage Under Fire"" and ""The Seige"", ""Legends of the Fall"" and the excellent film ""Glory"".  He doesn't make bad movies.

Take a few grains: yes, Samurai existed in Japan as an ancient, militaristic culture, a law unto themselves, & Japan was opening itself up to the west at the time of the movie (1876). Aside from that... Cruise is an emotionally damaged hero of the civil & Indian wars. He is contracted to whip the Japanese army into a fighting force. Who is the enemy? The Samurai, who are much admired & feared through-out Japan. They refuse to surrender to modernity & give up their way of life. In battle he is captured by the Samurai. Their leader is played very well by Ken Watenabe. He is impressed by Cruise's fighting skills & spares him. Can you guess the rest? Of course. It's right out of Dances with Wolves but probably less accurate. While a prisoner he adopts the Samurai lifestyle.  Oh the pain, the inner conflict, the over-acting. I said it was a GOOD movie (C+). That's it. The Samurai are doomed, destroyed by time  more than anything else. Well done battle scenes. Lots of really good extras in this two disc set.

808166,A1F6DHVFE1ZIXX,B0001JXOUS,John,"[7, 8]","I don't know how this movie got such a bad reputation.  When it first came out, all signs seemed to point to it being a horrible, tedious, Tom Cruise wants an Oscar, epic flop.  Maybe it was poor marketing, but this is far from true.  'The Last Samurai' is a riveting action adventure semi-epic.  How anyone could call this film tedious I really have no idea.The movie's premise may be a little hard to swallow at first glance.  Captain Algren, a disillusioned Civil War veteran (who also fought alongside the likes of Col. Custer of Little Bighorn fame) trains Japan's army to fight like Western soldiers, gets captured by the samurai and learns their ways to eventually become one of them.  I laughed at the idea just as much as anyone.  When you see the movie, you won't be laughing.  It's shocking how easily you are drawn in and believe everything you see.  This is how well done the movie is.  With the director of 'Glory' and the screenwriter of 'Gladiator', we should have expected no less.'The Last Samurai' is also more historically accurate than I would have believed.  Included in the special features of the DVD is a History Channel documentary which shows that pretty much the only Hollywood part of the movie is Tom Cruise's character.  Besides that, almost everything in the movie happened in real life.  The law banning samurai from carrying their swords is true, the rebellion of the samurai is true, and even the Emperor of Japan in the movie was a real emperor who actually did all the ""Westernizing"" of Japan.So if you've stayed away from this film expecting a disastor of a movie, give it a shot.  I grabbed it from the library, thinking ""Why not, it won't cost me anything"" and it blew me away.  After finishing it, I immediately delved into the special features, needing to know more about the movie, which is rare for me.

Tom brings a suitably tortured mein to the role as a late 1870's army captain fresh off the Indian wars of the west.  Brought over to Japan to ostensibly modernize their army and remove the vestiges of the samurai caste he is quickly captured and spends the rest of the movie going through a `Dances with Wolves' transformation into a gaijin warrior.  Despite the simplistic plot, the movie is delivered with a great earnestness and sense of purpose.  Watanabe is at once fierce and serene as the lead samurai, [was he a daimyo or in the service of one?].  This film hints at the beauty and depth of bushido, trying to make it understandable to the western sensibility.

He does get captured by the Samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) while in battle as he is brought to their village, Nathan begins to learn the ways of their life and even becomes one of the people for 2 years as learns to switch sides to fight on their side for honor and love.An amazing and sweeping old fashioned epic historical fiction drama from the director of the modern classic ""Glory"" Edward Zwick is one of the decade's best pictures. Co-starring Tony Goldwyn, Billy Connelly and Hiroyuki Sanada Koyuki this is a well made and violent adventure film that has a familar old story. Although very similar to films like ""Man Named Horse"", ""Dances with Wolves"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Last of the Mohicans"" this one takes the old story of those to Japan instead of being in the western times or the French-Indian war or Arabia. The acting is flawless as is the direction, the action sequences are gory and well made and the photography is just stunning as is Han Zimmer's score.This Blu-Ray offers quality picture in a great transfer that looks fresher and the sound is good as well and the extras include audio commentary, History Channel Documentary: Hollywood vs. History, 4 featurettes, deleted scenes, Japan premiere and trailer.",5,A sweeping epic!,1308096000,"06 15, 2011",2011,1417,"['1876', 'Japan', 'American', 'soldier', 'named', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'been', 'hired', 'Emperor', 'Meijii', 'train', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'fight', 'savage', 'Samurai', 'get', 'captured', 'Samurai', 'leader', 'Katsumoto', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'battle', 'brought', 'village', 'Nathan', 'learn', 'ways', 'life', 'even', 'one', 'people', '2', 'years', 'learns', 'switch', 'sides', 'fight', 'side', 'honor', 'love.An', 'amazing', 'sweeping', 'old', 'fashioned', 'epic', 'historical', 'fiction', 'drama', 'director', 'modern', 'classic', 'Glory', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'one', 'decade', 'best', 'pictures', 'Co-starring', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'Billy', 'Connelly', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'Koyuki', 'well', 'made', 'violent', 'adventure', 'film', 'familar', 'old', 'story', 'very', 'similar', 'films', 'Man', 'Named', 'Horse', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'one', 'old', 'story', 'Japan', 'instead', 'being', 'western', 'times', 'French-Indian', 'war', 'Arabia', 'acting', 'flawless', 'direction', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'gory', 'well', 'made', 'photography', 'just', 'stunning', 'Han', 'Zimmer', 'score.This', 'Blu-Ray', 'offers', 'quality', 'picture', 'great', 'transfer', 'fresher', 'sound', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'extras', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'History', 'Channel', 'Documentary', 'Hollywood', 'History', '4', 'featurettes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Japan', 'premiere', 'trailer']",N/A
808169,A3BO21YK08SSV8,B0001JXOUS,John M Walker,"[3, 5]","This epic film demonstrates that the technical competency of modern American filmmakers is complete.  But we already knew that, didn't we.However, in addition to technical virtuosity, there is undeniably artistic merit here.  In my mind the most artistic and therefore most interesting scene in the film is when Algren (Cruise) disembarks at Yokohama.  The lavish and loving care that obviously went into the creation of this time-piece set is impressive.  One could watch this scene over and over again, seeking new details each time, and enjoy the pastime.Further artistic inspiration comes from the natural settings provided by New Zealand, and in particular the composite cone of volcano Taranaki, standing in admirably for Fujiyama.  The geology of New Zealand is similar enough to Japan that this setting comes off very well in the story telling.  Also, kudos to the carpenters and design team who created the structures; this is really good stuff.Also in the positive column is the costumery, especially the Samurai armor.  All visual aspects of this film are superb.And so is the story line; there is much here to engage the imagination.This is withal a very good film, but with such elements described above going for it, it could have been a timeless classic of the filmmaker's art.  I acknowledge I may be far off the mark, but it seems to me these modern American filmmakers miss the mark time and again when it comes to where they ought to concentrate their efforts and imaginations, hence my accusation of this being a ""formulaic"" epic.These days a grandiose and expensively produced climactic battle is de rigueur, but why is this so?  Who decided this?  If you stop to think about it, is such extravagance necessary to tell this story?  In my opinion: no.  Is it necessary to make this film a financial success?  Again, in my opinion: no.  The short list of films I've seen that have ripped my guts out with the intensity of their message have included not a single violent act, which is not to say some violence is never useful in telling a story, but it can almost  always be suggested, instead of graphically portrayed.  For me, these battle scenes are boring.  I submit the correct formula for great story telling is to make such scenes brief interludes, then get back to the human drama, which hopefully will include some inspiring dialogue.At one point Algren muses: ""I am beset by the ironies of my life.""  Now here could be the beginning of something interesting, but this thought is not developed, and this nicely structured phrase is allowed to just drop.The heart of this story is the historical nexus of a medieval society attempting to catch up with the recently industrialized West, the dubious wisdom of doing so, and what might be left behind in so doing.  The human drama inherent in such events is truly the stuff of epic tales.  So why are these human dramas developed only briefly, and so much time and effort invested in fights and battles?  Clearly the producers think this is necessary for financial success.  It is not clear they are right about this.Other formulaic elements seem intended to add depth to the story, but accomplish the reverse.  We have the frontier cavalry as depraved and bad, and American Indians as noble and good.  We have the hatred of the heroically defiant and rebellious member of the frontier cavalry (whom we are prompted to love because he is so wise to be so rebellious; an island of wisdom in a sea of decadence) for his supposedly archetypal superior, with a result that will come as a complete surprise to all viewers who were born, so to speak, yesterday.I admit I'm nitpicking here, but Taka, played by Koyuki, looks like the modern model she is.  She is as lovely as can be, but an actress of her physical stature must surely have been selected to cater to modern tastes (as decided by casting); a more typically diminutive Japanese actress would have been more convincing.So, my recommendation is to watch this movie because it has very considerable merit, but my question is: who decided modern American moviegoers are primarily induced to pay money to see gory battle scenes and care little about complex human interaction?  I think they got it backwards, and don't seem about to budge.",4,"A Grand, But Formulaic Epic.",1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,4265,"['epic', 'film', 'technical', 'competency', 'modern', 'American', 'filmmakers', 'complete', 'already', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'we.However', 'addition', 'technical', 'virtuosity', 'undeniably', 'artistic', 'merit', 'here', 'mind', 'most', 'artistic', 'therefore', 'most', 'interesting', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'Algren', 'Cruise', 'Yokohama', 'lavish', 'loving', 'care', 'obviously', 'went', 'creation', 'time-piece', 'set', 'impressive', 'One', 'could', 'watch', 'scene', 'over', 'again', 'seeking', 'new', 'details', 'time', 'enjoy', 'pastime.Further', 'artistic', 'inspiration', 'natural', 'settings', 'provided', 'New', 'Zealand', 'particular', 'composite', 'cone', 'volcano', 'Taranaki', 'standing', 'admirably', 'Fujiyama', 'geology', 'New', 'Zealand', 'similar', 'enough', 'Japan', 'setting', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'story', 'telling', 'Also', 'carpenters', 'design', 'team', 'who', 'created', 'structures', 'really', 'good', 'stuff.Also', 'positive', 'column', 'costumery', 'especially', 'Samurai', 'armor', 'visual', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'superb.And', 'so', 'story', 'line', 'much', 'here', 'engage', 'imagination.This', 'withal', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'such', 'elements', 'described', 'going', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'timeless', 'classic', 'filmmaker', 'art', 'acknowledge', 'may', 'be', 'far', 'mark', 'modern', 'American', 'filmmakers', 'miss', 'mark', 'time', 'again', 'when', 'where', 'ought', 'concentrate', 'efforts', 'imaginations', 'hence', 'accusation', 'being', 'formulaic', 'epic.These', 'days', 'grandiose', 'expensively', 'produced', 'climactic', 'battle', 'de', 'rigueur', 'why', 'so', 'Who', 'decided', 'stop', 'think', 'such', 'extravagance', 'necessary', 'tell', 'story', 'opinion', 'necessary', 'make', 'film', 'financial', 'success', 'Again', 'opinion', 'short', 'list', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'ripped', 'guts', 'out', 'intensity', 'message', 'have', 'included', 'not', 'single', 'violent', 'act', 'not', 'say', 'violence', 'never', 'useful', 'telling', 'story', 'can', 'almost', 'always', 'be', 'suggested', 'instead', 'graphically', 'portrayed', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'boring', 'submit', 'correct', 'formula', 'great', 'story', 'telling', 'make', 'such', 'scenes', 'brief', 'interludes', 'then', 'get', 'back', 'human', 'drama', 'hopefully', 'will', 'include', 'inspiring', 'dialogue.At', 'one', 'point', 'Algren', 'am', 'beset', 'ironies', 'life', 'Now', 'here', 'could', 'be', 'beginning', 'something', 'interesting', 'thought', 'not', 'developed', 'nicely', 'structured', 'phrase', 'allowed', 'just', 'drop.The', 'heart', 'story', 'historical', 'nexus', 'medieval', 'society', 'attempting', 'catch', 'up', 'recently', 'industrialized', 'West', 'dubious', 'wisdom', 'doing', 'so', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'left', 'behind', 'so', 'doing', 'human', 'drama', 'inherent', 'such', 'events', 'truly', 'stuff', 'epic', 'tales', 'So', 'why', 'are', 'human', 'dramas', 'developed', 'only', 'briefly', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'effort', 'invested', 'fights', 'battles', 'Clearly', 'producers', 'think', 'necessary', 'financial', 'success', 'not', 'clear', 'are', 'right', 'this.Other', 'formulaic', 'elements', 'seem', 'intended', 'add', 'depth', 'story', 'reverse', 'have', 'frontier', 'cavalry', 'depraved', 'bad', 'American', 'Indians', 'noble', 'good', 'have', 'hatred', 'heroically', 'defiant', 'rebellious', 'member', 'frontier', 'cavalry', 'whom', 'are', 'prompted', 'love', 'so', 'wise', 'be', 'so', 'rebellious', 'island', 'wisdom', 'sea', 'decadence', 'supposedly', 'archetypal', 'superior', 'result', 'will', 'come', 'complete', 'surprise', 'viewers', 'who', 'were', 'born', 'so', 'speak', 'yesterday.I', 'admit', ""'m"", 'nitpicking', 'here', 'Taka', 'played', 'Koyuki', 'modern', 'model', 'as', 'lovely', 'can', 'be', 'actress', 'physical', 'stature', 'must', 'surely', 'have', 'been', 'selected', 'cater', 'modern', 'tastes', 'decided', 'casting', 'more', 'typically', 'diminutive', 'Japanese', 'actress', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'convincing.So', 'recommendation', 'watch', 'movie', 'very', 'considerable', 'merit', 'question', 'who', 'decided', 'modern', 'American', 'moviegoers', 'are', 'primarily', 'induced', 'pay', 'money', 'see', 'gory', 'battle', 'scenes', 'care', 'little', 'complex', 'human', 'interaction', 'think', 'got', 'backwards', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'about', 'budge']",N/A

808176,A1TKM36EYEQNSM,B0001JXOUS,Joseph J. Slevin,"[5, 5]","This movie is a very interesting look at opportunism, guilt and shame on the one hand and opportunity, pride and honor on the other.  The irony throughout the movie was a comparing of these things within two cultural frameworks.  The clash between the old world being encroached upon by a new world.The comparison between the opportunism of the US against the native American tribes compared to the resistance of the old world Japanese Samurai was fascinating to say the least.  The characters that were played by Watanabe and Cruise were very much linked through similar issues but from vastly different persepectives.Cruise plays a US Calvary Captain (Nathan Algren) who is tormented by his past and when he goes to Japan on a mercenary mission to assist the Emperor's minions in defeating the last hold out of the old ways he is forced to see himself and the world he is from through a different lens.The cavalier versus the discipline and strength of the Samurai are showed over again.  Algren goes through a metamorphasis of sorts.  It is a different look at the issues of east versus west.At varying points in the film, Algren is seen going through a conflict in his mind that torments him.  He is seen running from and with this scene playing within his psyche at all times.  His torment reaches it's climax in his captivity.  That is where the story changes and a man is free.The issues that contain the ironies are things to look for, the western ways of expediency and convenience versus the eastern ways of patience.  Katsumoto (Watanabe) has a righteous anger, yet you need to listen carefully to his raging with the Emperor.....Algren finds himself in a new world and a new mentality.  I was left to wonder if there is a metaphor regarding today's east verse west conflict.  Today, some of the west come to adopt eastern ideology and even side with those in conflict with their societies.  It seems more that Cruise is accepting a cause than anything else and releases himself from his torment.The movie reflects a full range of emotion from sorrow, to anger to love and deep reflection.  This is rated R yet only for the violence and some language, there is no sex, no nudity and very little language and some of what is spoken is almost humorous.  Billy Connoly looks like John Cleese.  He has a few lines that come across funny to a degree.Tony Goldwyn plays Cruise's alter-ego who stays in character throughout.The battle scenes, from the two larger battles to the one small skirmish are pictured very intensely.  I wonder if the scenes showing the battle between the Samurai and the newly formed Japanese army are really a reflection of the American Indian fighting the US Army in the great Indian wars.  It is from the same timeframe and to me it seems possible that the message was easier to get across so that it would be acceptable for those who are resistant to politically correct messages.The basic story though is well thought out and well presented.  I would have rated it a 5 and many would do so as well, yet the ""BraveHeart"" type violence to me is getting a little worn thin.  The sheer violence of the small battle that ensued in Tokyo was enough to show intensity and bravado. The scene of hand to hand combat was appropriate and realistic.  I particularly was impressed with the intense desire to live shown in that scene.The sensation of emotion is very intense in this film and sensationalism was not necessary for me.I will watch this movie again and will add it to my wish list.",4,Of Shame  and Honor - Cruise's Conflict,1087862400,"06 22, 2004",2004,3515,"['movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'look', 'opportunism', 'guilt', 'shame', 'one', 'hand', 'opportunity', 'pride', 'honor', 'other', 'irony', 'movie', 'was', 'comparing', 'things', 'two', 'cultural', 'frameworks', 'clash', 'old', 'world', 'being', 'encroached', 'new', 'world.The', 'comparison', 'opportunism', 'US', 'native', 'American', 'tribes', 'compared', 'resistance', 'old', 'world', 'Japanese', 'Samurai', 'was', 'fascinating', 'say', 'least', 'characters', 'were', 'played', 'Watanabe', 'Cruise', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'linked', 'similar', 'issues', 'vastly', 'different', 'persepectives.Cruise', 'US', 'Calvary', 'Captain', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'who', 'tormented', 'past', 'when', 'Japan', 'mercenary', 'mission', 'assist', 'Emperor', 'minions', 'defeating', 'last', 'hold', 'old', 'ways', 'forced', 'see', 'world', 'different', 'lens.The', 'cavalier', 'discipline', 'strength', 'Samurai', 'are', 'showed', 'again', 'Algren', 'metamorphasis', 'sorts', 'different', 'look', 'issues', 'east', 'versus', 'west.At', 'varying', 'points', 'film', 'Algren', 'seen', 'going', 'conflict', 'mind', 'seen', 'running', 'scene', 'playing', 'psyche', 'times', 'torment', 'climax', 'captivity', 'where', 'story', 'changes', 'man', 'free.The', 'issues', 'contain', 'ironies', 'are', 'things', 'look', 'western', 'ways', 'expediency', 'convenience', 'eastern', 'ways', 'patience', 'Katsumoto', 'Watanabe', 'righteous', 'anger', 'yet', 'need', 'listen', 'carefully', 'raging', 'Emperor', '..Algren', 'new', 'world', 'new', 'mentality', 'was', 'left', 'wonder', 'metaphor', 'regarding', 'today', 'east', 'verse', 'west', 'conflict', 'Today', 'west', 'come', 'adopt', 'eastern', 'ideology', 'even', 'side', 'conflict', 'societies', 'more', 'Cruise', 'accepting', 'cause', 'anything', 'else', 'torment.The', 'movie', 'full', 'range', 'emotion', 'sorrow', 'anger', 'love', 'deep', 'reflection', 'rated', 'R', 'yet', 'only', 'violence', 'language', 'sex', 'nudity', 'very', 'little', 'language', 'what', 'spoken', 'almost', 'humorous', 'Billy', 'Connoly', 'John', 'Cleese', 'few', 'lines', 'come', 'funny', 'degree.Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'Cruise', 'alter-ego', 'who', 'character', 'throughout.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'two', 'larger', 'battles', 'one', 'small', 'skirmish', 'are', 'pictured', 'very', 'intensely', 'wonder', 'scenes', 'showing', 'battle', 'Samurai', 'newly', 'formed', 'Japanese', 'army', 'are', 'really', 'reflection', 'American', 'Indian', 'fighting', 'US', 'Army', 'great', 'Indian', 'wars', 'same', 'timeframe', 'possible', 'message', 'was', 'easier', 'get', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'acceptable', 'who', 'are', 'resistant', 'politically', 'correct', 'messages.The', 'basic', 'story', 'though', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'well', 'presented', 'would', 'have', 'rated', '5', 'many', 'would', 'do', 'so', 'as', 'well', 'yet', 'BraveHeart', 'type', 'violence', 'getting', 'little', 'worn', 'thin', 'sheer', 'violence', 'small', 'battle', 'ensued', 'Tokyo', 'was', 'enough', 'show', 'intensity', 'bravado', 'scene', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'was', 'appropriate', 'realistic', 'particularly', 'was', 'impressed', 'intense', 'desire', 'live', 'shown', 'scene.The', 'sensation', 'emotion', 'very', 'intense', 'film', 'sensationalism', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'me.I', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'will', 'add', 'wish', 'list']",N/A

Just substitute Japanese for Native Americans.This movie is a good mass-entertainment.  Japanese culture and history is dumbed-down for popular consumption.  Don't quite expect the realism we find in Kurosawa films here.  Like Dances with Wolves, this movie is painfully politically-correct.  I assume that the filmmakers were forced to proceed under the assumption that American audiences might not know what the Samurai - or indeed, the Japanese - are.  The unfortunate thing is that they are probably right.We stop at all the expected signposts along the way.  The Tom Cruise character forms a growing love for the foreign, yet honorable, ways of the Samurai.  We are treated to the pre-requisite attack by Ninjas.  Fortunately, there are plenty of swordfights, but the level of realism is about the same as in Kill Bill (I know something of Japanese fencings and exchanges - like in Kurosawa films - are brief and deadly).The film looks great.  Ken Watanabe gives a great performance as the eponymous Last Samurai.  Luckily, through an eye-popping coincidence, his character happens to speak English.

The movie completely suspended this disbelief right until the horribly awful last scene. Tom Cruise plays a drunken Civil War hero who hired by the Japanese government to modernize their army is captured by the Samurai rebels and falls in love with their doomed way of life.And what a life. Every shot of the Samurai village is postcard perfect almost to the point of unintended parody. Like Robert Redford's take on Montana in ""Legends of the Fall"", every view is spectacular, every sunset is orange, every leaf is colorful and falls just so and all the characters are freshly scrubbed and dressed in their Sunday best. You wouldn't be half surprised to see Hobbits pop out at any moment. Of course the old time Samurai are romanticized to the nth degree. Historically the Samurai at this point resembled Afghan warlords resisting a long overdue central government rather than the honorable colorfully armored knights that are depicted. (Samurai no more wore armor in the late 18th century than the British army did.)Yet the picture despite one or two faults works. The acting, with one exception is uniformly excellent. The battle scenes are plentiful and full of surprise and the pacing is good. On the dark side newcomer Nakamura Shichinosuke plays the Japanese emperor like he was channeling Michael Jackson. The voice and mannerisms of the gloved one is as out of place for a Japanese emperor than it would be for the Pope.

Algren takes on this task for money and no other reason, he does not care about anything or anyone, death is no longer something he fears and it is partly this lack of fear that saves his life when he is captured by the `enemy,' who take him to their camp and inadvertently bring him spiritually closer to the way of the Samurai.Algren slowly falls under the spell of the Samurai Code of Honour and he eventually switches his allegiance in battle, ending up fighting with the Samurai against the people he was brought over to train.He forges a tenuous relationship with Taka, the widow of the man he killed in battle, and becomes a father figure to her two young sons and wins the grudging respect of the Samurai sword trainer who tries to break his spirit and his bones.The film does to a certain extent become a study in redemption as Algren strives to find his place in the scheme of things and to erase the guilt of his dishonourable past actions.  Eventually though Algren comes to realise he cannot erase the past, he can either live with it or let it crush him.He chooses to live but only as a Samurai, and that could mean his death at any given moment.The whole film was a vibrant, violent, passionate look into a past that Japan has never been able to reclaim since the days of the Samurai.  With the western world on the doorstep trying to force their way in, Japan had to let go of some of her ancient traditions to survive and in doing so lost a big part of herself.The Last Samurai has been accused of being too much on the side of the Samurai, but I think it manages to find a kind of balance, with both good and bad on both sides, and the over all film certainly deserves the five stars I am giving it.Cruise does well not to fluff the Japanese language too much in the movie, I liked that they used subtitles, it gave the movie considerable authenticity, and the fight scenes as gory as they were, were breathtaking to watch, along with a fabulous musical score and scenery that I can't even do justice to in this critique.A movie I will be watching again I think, because you cannot honestly take everything in, in just one viewing.By far one of the best movies to come out of 2003 in my opinion.",5,A film for all those honourable warriors out there,1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,2960,"['Set', '1870', 'Japan', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'story', 'Japan', 'struggle', 'come', 'terms', 'modern', 'world', 'whilst', 'same', 'time', 'embracing', 'traditional', 'past.Tom', 'Cruise', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'tormented', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'former', 'captain', 'US', 'army', 'who', 'having', 'trouble', 'conscience', 'unusual', 'white', 'man', '19th', 'century', 'haunted', 'past', 'past', 'saw', 'play', 'role', 'slaughter', 'innocent', 'Native', 'American', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'own', 'country.Algren', 'eventually', 'go', 'Japan', 'help', 'train', 'soldiers', 'ways', 'modern', 'warfare', 'nation', 'leaders', 'can', 'take', 'destroy', 'sole', 'remnants', 'Samurai', 'forces', 'are', 'still', 'clinging', 'old', 'ways', 'Algren', 'task', 'money', 'other', 'reason', 'not', 'care', 'anything', 'anyone', 'death', 'longer', 'something', 'partly', 'lack', 'fear', 'life', 'when', 'captured', 'enemy', 'who', 'take', 'camp', 'inadvertently', 'bring', 'spiritually', 'closer', 'way', 'Samurai.Algren', 'slowly', 'spell', 'Samurai', 'Code', 'Honour', 'eventually', 'allegiance', 'battle', 'ending', 'up', 'fighting', 'Samurai', 'people', 'was', 'brought', 'over', 'train.He', 'forges', 'tenuous', 'relationship', 'Taka', 'widow', 'man', 'killed', 'battle', 'father', 'figure', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'grudging', 'respect', 'Samurai', 'sword', 'trainer', 'who', 'break', 'spirit', 'bones.The', 'film', 'certain', 'extent', 'become', 'study', 'redemption', 'Algren', 'find', 'place', 'scheme', 'things', 'erase', 'guilt', 'dishonourable', 'past', 'actions', 'Eventually', 'Algren', 'realise', 'can', 'not', 'erase', 'past', 'can', 'either', 'live', 'let', 'crush', 'him.He', 'chooses', 'live', 'only', 'Samurai', 'could', 'mean', 'death', 'given', 'moment.The', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'vibrant', 'violent', 'passionate', 'look', 'past', 'Japan', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'reclaim', 'days', 'Samurai', 'western', 'world', 'doorstep', 'trying', 'force', 'way', 'Japan', 'had', 'let', 'go', 'ancient', 'traditions', 'survive', 'doing', 'so', 'lost', 'big', 'part', 'herself.The', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'been', 'accused', 'being', 'too', 'much', 'side', 'Samurai', 'think', 'find', 'kind', 'balance', 'good', 'bad', 'sides', 'film', 'certainly', 'five', 'stars', 'am', 'giving', 'it.Cruise', 'well', 'not', 'fluff', 'Japanese', 'language', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'liked', 'used', 'subtitles', 'gave', 'movie', 'considerable', 'authenticity', 'fight', 'scenes', 'as', 'gory', 'were', 'were', 'breathtaking', 'watch', 'fabulous', 'musical', 'score', 'scenery', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'justice', 'critique.A', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'think', 'can', 'not', 'honestly', 'take', 'everything', 'just', 'one', 'viewing.By', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'come', '2003', 'opinion']",N/A

I was the victim of bad marketing. The trailer does not show what the movie is truly about. This film is a wonderful exploration of interaction among societies and how the world as a diverse planet can learn from one another. The film was excellent because it really showed the audience about Samurai life and built on the characters and their ideologies. We learn through watching how a Samurai grows up trained to obey the emperor and lives by honor. Through the intense character development comes the importance of the ending. Cruise also gave a good performance but as you've all heard, Ken Watanabe steals the show. Hans Zimmer's score also brought the movie to life as does all of his incredible scores for their movies. The Last Samurai does however becomes the victim of Hollywood cinema. The film is not all historically accurate, but then again the purpose of the film isn't really to be a documentary, but more of a character exploration. This is a movie that is a little gem, not a masterpiece, but not something you want to throw away.VIDEO: The only problem with this transfer is a little grain here and there, but overall a nice effort by Warner. There is also the flaw of some blurring during fast paced scenes.AUDIO: The disc has a Dolby 5.1 track and is pretty clean but not as good as it should be.PACKAGING / EXTRAS: The disc comes in a standard two disc Amaray case (I love two disc sets from warner cause they can't put them in snapper cases).

808190,A2HG5MY4YOY7N2,B0001JXOUS,Kelvin H.,"[2, 2]","The poetic resonance of ""The Last Samurai"" makes it a unique and thoughtful epic where two warriors contrasted by culture are akin in honor. The modernization of Japan serves as the underlying for the collision of differences between Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) and Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Almost poetically and serenely does the movie converge these two characters as one is seeking his lost beliefs and the other is sustaining his honor from an ever-changing world.The second act of ""The Last Samurai"" is the heart and soul of the movie as we marvel at the ways of the society from the sword training and disciplined lifestyle. All that is demolished by the third act. I admire the battle scenes and I do find it the source of the problem. Instead, the last scene was not necessary, it was inconsistent with the tone of the movie, and it went against everything the development of the movie. By having the modernized Japanese army kneel for the samurais and having the Emperor suddenly dismiss the arms agreement with the U.S. and becoming tearful for the samurais, it has sugarcoated the entire film. The film was about the honor carried by the samurais and how it is slowly diminishing beneath Western influences. Then all of a sudden, as if to make the audience feel a little bit better, director Edward Zwick decides to make a happy ending where all the samurais died victorious. We already know that the samurais are the heroes who died for a cause, but to have the Emperor suddenly feel apologetic makes him and the movie appear as feeble.

808191,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B0001JXOUS,Kenji Fujishima,"[0, 2]","Until the ending (which a previous reviewer correctly described as &quot;maudlin&quot;), Edward Zwick's THE LAST SAMURAI is a magnificent samurai epic, filled with great big emotions but also blessed with more thoughtfulness and intimacy than the usual Hollywood epic. The insights into Japan during this particular time setting---the late 1800s, when the samurai way of life was slowly fading away and Westernization was taking over---are sure to fascinate, and the action scenes are first-rate, as is the widescreen cinematography here by John Toll.Ken Watanabe got justly deserved plaudits for his authoritative supporting turn here as samurai leader Katsumoto---he really takes the screen by force. A lot of critics, for some reason, weren't so complementary to Tom Cruise, as the American Nathan Algren, here. Perhaps they thought his pretty-boy image got in the way of either the epic's grand ambition or the effectiveness of his own performance. Whatever the reason, I personally didn't have such problems with Cruise in this movie---he seemed convincing enough here, although he certainly is upstaged by the sheer authority of Watanabe's performance.In short, THE LAST SAMURAI is overall a grand and glorious epic that admirably attempts to be more than just pretty pictures and awesome action scenes, and, more often than not, it succeeds in its noble ambitions.

The more one knows about the samurai, the more ""phoney"" this film appears to be.  Make no mistake, this film is more about samurai ideals rather than the actual samurai.  This film romanticizes the samurai warrior class when many people understand the samurai as nothing more than a bunch of sword-wielding bullies who enforced the will of the local warlord or Daimyo.  There's an early scene in the movie ""SHOGUN"" where a samurai instantly sliced off the head of a peasant who simply did not bow in the presence of a samurai.  I watched Kurosawa's ""RAN"" (before watching ""THE LAST SAMURAI"" in the cinema) where the samurai are portrayed as self-destructive powermongers.  ""THE LAST SAMURAI"" looks good visually, but its potential as a great film is compromised by Tom Cruise's egotism and Hollywood's cliches and obligatory plot devices (such as the weak ""happy"" ending).  Nonetheless, this film is a good introduction to the CONCEPT of the samurai to anyone who knows little about this complex warrior elite that have come to symbolize the old agrarian Japan that is now seemingly lost in today's technocratic Japan.By the way, Japan's new modern army was modelled along Prussian lines.  The sight of American officers training Japanese soldiers wearing Prussian-looking uniforms continues to leave me baffled.

During the fight he was defeated and captured by the enemy. While in captivity he was introduced to the traditional Japanese way of life.

This movie focuses on the positive aspects of traditional views and living pitted against unchecked modernism/materialism. And except for a couple of silly, overly sentimental scenes, the director Edward Zwick, largely delivers in telling the tale of redemption.Tom Cruise as Capt Nathan Algren brings in his usual performance.  He is neither outstanding or poor, but he is effective and unlike other movies where he has overacted (Born on the Fourth of July), he here is stable and is enjoyable to watch (however, his best performances in my opinion is Minority Report).  Ken Watanabe is simply outstanding!  He provides a strong anchor to carry this movie along.The fight/battle scenes are exceptional and fall a little short in epic style to Gibson's Brave Hart.  If one can concentrate on the redemption of Cruise's character and the changing of people's attitudes towards each other, then one will come away from this movie with a great experience; however, if one is only their for the action, or to criticize the so-called left leaning message or to use this movie as a propaganda against the West, then they will also miss the most important part of this film:  Capt Algren's redemption.The film score works very well.  The film does fail in articulating the Bushido code fully, because it relies to heavy on a visual style and the characters should have dialoged about this way of life further.

He is captured by his enemy, Katusmoto (Watanabe) and taken to his village, where he comes to appreciate the Samurai values.This is such a beautiful film.  It has lots of battle scenes, but they are balanced by quiet vignettes where Algren learns the language and culture, and begins to take part in village life.  He comes to admire the traditional values of these people.  The overwhelming sense of honor, duty, tradition, and respect fill the story with grace and elegance.Cruise is very good here, but I was even more impressed with the wonderful performance of Ken Watanabe, who plays the title role.  He combined ultimate power and quiet elegance to create a memorable character.  The photography and music make a truly lovely epic.

808205,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B0001JXOUS,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[4, 5]","SPOILERS INCLUDEDTHE LAST SAMURAI is one of the best efforts of Tom Cruise's uneven and strange career. Very loosely based on actual events, THE LAST SAMURAI recounts the story of the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, when the Samurai forced the last stand of traditional Japanese culture against the the modernizing influences of the Meiji Restoration.As part of his drive to bring Japan into the family of nations the Meiji Emperor hired literal armies of foreign advisors. In the film Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a survivor of Gettysburg who later served under Custer and fought Indians on the frontier. The brutalities he has seen have rendered Captain Algren a nightmare-ridden and viciously cynical drunkard. Recruited to go to Japan and train the modern Japanese Army by his despised former superior, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), Algren at first adopts the endemic sneering attitude toward the Samurai shared by the ""modernizers"". However, the more he hears of the Samurai, the more respect Algren begins to accord them, much to the disgust of his fellows.When his green army is forced into a premature engagement with the Samurai, Algren is captured and held prisoner by the Samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Watanabe is the true star of this film. His powerful but understated performance is electric, and Katsumoto's character expresses the best of the Bushido Code and of Japanese tradition. As Algren observes his enemies (and they observe him), hatred mellows into distrust, distrust mellows into acquiescence, acquiescence mellows into acceptance, acceptance becomes respect, and respect becomes liking, and then true friendship. Algren, the professional soldier, comes to see the Bushido Code and the disciplined lifestyle of his captors as the highest expression of his own art---the Art of War. When battle comes, Algren casts his lot with the Samurai.Although given a safe passage to Tokyo, Katsumoto is unable to sway the young and timid Meiji Emperor, his former student, who is as much a prisoner of the ""modernizers"" as Algren had been of the Samurai traditionalists. Hostilities flare again when Omura (Masato Harada) the chief of the ""modernizers"" tries to have Katsumoto assassinated. The Samurai withdraw into the mountains and prepare for the final battle. When it comes, the Samurai nearly overwhelm their opponents, but armed with cannons and gatling guns, the modern army is insurmountable. In the end, only Algren survives to bring Katsumoto's sword to the Emperor. Although Algren is spat upon by Omura, the Meiji Emperor is so moved by Katsumoto's reverence for the old ways that he orders Omura to commit seppuku. In the end, the cowardly Omura merely exiles himself.THE LAST SAMURAI had only a lukewarm reception in the United States. Some reviewers felt that the character of Captain Algren was of the ""White Man's Burden"" ilk, that the film was disrespectful of the American historical experience, and that the Samurai were overidealized. Much of this can be put down to a festering dislike of Cruise in the wake of his divorce from Nicole Kidman. However, the film was wildly successful in Japan, and many moviegoers left the theaters in tears, moved by the powerful depiction of traditional Japanese values in the character of Katsumoto and his fellow Samurai. While it is true that much of the Bushido Code was vastly oversimplified in the telling, the essence of Samurai values permeates the film, which, after all, is a form of entertainment, not a philosophical discussion.The ""Extras"" disc is an ""Extras"" disc. Once a pastiche of fascinating folderol, ""Extras"" discs have degenerated into a predictable melange of ""The Making Of..."", pointless commentaries, and deleted scenes we wish had stayed deleted. This one isn't much different, though it does have a nice ""Hollywood vs. History"" segment that discusses the real samurai, in truth largely a repressive and regressive elite that had outlived themselves in the 19th century. What might have been very interesting would have been a discussion of how the Bushido Code was institutionally perverted into racist militarism in the first half of the 20th century. The segment barely touches on that subject.A vast and sweeping epic in the vein ofBraveheart,Spartacus, andLawrence of Arabia (Limited Edition), THE LAST SAMURAI is an engaging, respectful, and moving tale well worth watching many more times than once.",5,"""Perfect...They Are All Perfect...""",1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,4418,"['SPOILERS', 'INCLUDEDTHE', 'LAST', 'SAMURAI', 'one', 'best', 'efforts', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'uneven', 'strange', 'career', 'Very', 'loosely', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'LAST', 'SAMURAI', 'story', 'Satsuma', 'Rebellion', '1877', 'when', 'Samurai', 'forced', 'last', 'stand', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'modernizing', 'influences', 'Meiji', 'Restoration.As', 'part', 'drive', 'bring', 'Japan', 'family', 'nations', 'Meiji', 'Emperor', 'hired', 'literal', 'armies', 'foreign', 'advisors', 'film', 'Cruise', 'Captain', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'survivor', 'Gettysburg', 'who', 'later', 'served', 'Custer', 'fought', 'Indians', 'frontier', 'brutalities', 'seen', 'have', 'rendered', 'Captain', 'Algren', 'nightmare-ridden', 'viciously', 'cynical', 'drunkard', 'Recruited', 'go', 'Japan', 'train', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'Army', 'despised', 'former', 'superior', 'Colonel', 'Bagley', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'Algren', 'first', 'endemic', 'sneering', 'attitude', 'Samurai', 'shared', 'modernizers', 'However', 'more', 'Samurai', 'more', 'respect', 'Algren', 'accord', 'much', 'disgust', 'fellows.When', 'green', 'army', 'forced', 'premature', 'engagement', 'Samurai', 'Algren', 'captured', 'held', 'prisoner', 'Samurai', 'leader', 'Katsumoto', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Watanabe', 'true', 'star', 'film', 'powerful', 'understated', 'performance', 'electric', 'Katsumoto', 'character', 'best', 'Bushido', 'Code', 'Japanese', 'tradition', 'Algren', 'enemies', 'observe', 'hatred', 'mellows', 'distrust', 'distrust', 'mellows', 'acquiescence', 'acquiescence', 'mellows', 'acceptance', 'acceptance', 'becomes', 'respect', 'respect', 'becomes', 'liking', 'then', 'true', 'friendship', 'Algren', 'professional', 'soldier', 'see', 'Bushido', 'Code', 'disciplined', 'lifestyle', 'captors', 'highest', 'expression', 'own', 'art', '-the', 'Art', 'War', 'When', 'battle', 'Algren', 'lot', 'Samurai.Although', 'given', 'safe', 'passage', 'Tokyo', 'Katsumoto', 'unable', 'sway', 'young', 'timid', 'Meiji', 'Emperor', 'former', 'student', 'who', 'as', 'much', 'prisoner', 'modernizers', 'Algren', 'had', 'been', 'Samurai', 'traditionalists', 'Hostilities', 'flare', 'again', 'when', 'Omura', 'Masato', 'Harada', 'chief', 'modernizers', 'tries', 'have', 'Katsumoto', 'assassinated', 'Samurai', 'withdraw', 'mountains', 'prepare', 'final', 'battle', 'When', 'Samurai', 'nearly', 'overwhelm', 'opponents', 'armed', 'cannons', 'gatling', 'guns', 'modern', 'army', 'insurmountable', 'end', 'only', 'Algren', 'bring', 'Katsumoto', 'sword', 'Emperor', 'Algren', 'spat', 'Omura', 'Meiji', 'Emperor', 'so', 'moved', 'Katsumoto', 'reverence', 'old', 'ways', 'orders', 'Omura', 'commit', 'seppuku', 'end', 'cowardly', 'Omura', 'merely', 'himself.THE', 'LAST', 'SAMURAI', 'had', 'only', 'lukewarm', 'reception', 'United', 'States', 'reviewers', 'felt', 'character', 'Captain', 'Algren', 'was', 'White', 'Man', 'Burden', 'ilk', 'film', 'was', 'disrespectful', 'American', 'historical', 'experience', 'Samurai', 'were', 'overidealized', 'Much', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'down', 'festering', 'dislike', 'Cruise', 'wake', 'divorce', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'However', 'film', 'was', 'wildly', 'successful', 'Japan', 'many', 'moviegoers', 'left', 'theaters', 'tears', 'moved', 'powerful', 'depiction', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'values', 'character', 'Katsumoto', 'fellow', 'Samurai', 'true', 'much', 'Bushido', 'Code', 'was', 'vastly', 'oversimplified', 'telling', 'essence', 'Samurai', 'values', 'film', 'form', 'entertainment', 'not', 'philosophical', 'discussion.The', 'Extras', 'disc', 'Extras', 'disc', 'Once', 'pastiche', 'fascinating', 'folderol', 'Extras', 'discs', 'have', 'degenerated', 'predictable', 'melange', 'Making', 'pointless', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'wish', 'had', 'stayed', 'deleted', 'one', ""n't"", 'much', 'different', 'have', 'nice', 'Hollywood', 'vs.', 'History', 'segment', 'real', 'samurai', 'truth', 'largely', 'repressive', 'regressive', 'elite', 'had', 'outlived', '19th', 'century', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'interesting', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'discussion', 'how', 'Bushido', 'Code', 'was', 'institutionally', 'perverted', 'racist', 'militarism', 'first', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'segment', 'barely', 'subject.A', 'vast', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'vein', 'ofBraveheart', 'Spartacus', 'andLawrence', 'Arabia', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'LAST', 'SAMURAI', 'engaging', 'respectful', 'moving', 'tale', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'once']",N/A

I found the movie generally interesting and entertaining as a movie. However, as an historical epic it is quite lacking. The plot in the movie and especially the character played by Tom Cruise often reminded me of the ""Shogun"" television mini-series and the film ""Dances with Wolves."" The ending also reminded me of ""The Charge of the Light Brigade,"" starring Errol Flynn. I also think ""The Last Samurai"" tends to somewhat overly romanticize the samurai in Japan of the 1860's.People can honestly debate whether a film's significant historical inaccuracies justly merit criticism and/or an overall less favorable review. As an action movie i would rate ""The Last Samurai"" four stars. However, for many of the same reasons why I have considerable reservations about the very unrealistic character played by Kevin Costner in ""Dances with Wolves,"" I will give ""The Last Samurai"" only three stars.""The Last Samurai is certainly worth watching. However, the  army officer played by Tom Cruise detracts from the historical validity in the film of the negative reaction by many of the samurai to modernization efforts in Japan during the late 1860's. The movie would have been potentially better, in my opinion, if the samurai story had been told entirely from a Japanese point of view.",3,Shogun meets Dances with Wolves,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,1380,"['movie', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'appeal', 'persons', 'who', 'action', 'films', 'quasi', 'historical', 'epics', 'found', 'movie', 'generally', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'However', 'historical', 'epic', 'quite', 'lacking', 'plot', 'movie', 'especially', 'character', 'played', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'often', 'reminded', 'Shogun', 'television', 'mini-series', 'film', 'Wolves', 'ending', 'also', 'reminded', 'Charge', 'Light', 'Brigade', 'starring', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'also', 'think', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'somewhat', 'overly', 'romanticize', 'samurai', 'Japan', ""1860's.People"", 'can', 'honestly', 'debate', 'film', 'significant', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'justly', 'merit', 'criticism', 'and/or', 'overall', 'less', 'favorable', 'review', 'action', 'movie', 'i', 'would', 'rate', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'four', 'stars', 'However', 'many', 'same', 'reasons', 'why', 'have', 'considerable', 'reservations', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'character', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'will', 'give', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'However', 'army', 'officer', 'played', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'historical', 'validity', 'film', 'negative', 'reaction', 'many', 'samurai', 'modernization', 'efforts', 'Japan', 'late', '1860', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'potentially', 'better', 'opinion', 'samurai', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'entirely', 'Japanese', 'point', 'view']",N/A

They also feared more foreign intervention in the coming years, and saw a gradual eroding of their Emporer's power.This is one of the few Tom Cruise movies that I felt he didn't try to carry the whole film.

It is brilliant and poignant, with emotional and brilliant performances by Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, and the rest of the cast. Tom Cruise is Captain Nathan Algren, a man who is conflicted by the past by a very serious incident that happened during the Civil War. He is offered a job in Japan, where he is going to train the emperor's soldiers. But, when they are pulled into combat early, that is when during the soldiers' first attack that Algren is captured by the Samurai and kept alive by Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe. That he is where he learns about his enemy and gets enlightened by them and decides to stay with them. Timothy Spall plays Simon Graham, a translator and photographer who is with Algren in this magnificent journey. Billy Connolly plays Zebulon Gant, a dear friend of Algren. Tony Goldwyn plays Colonel Bagley, a comrade and enemy of Algren's. This is a brilliant movie with a powerful story and a powerful word about how you look at things and you think at what they should be. Edward Zwick's directing is brilliant. The costume design by Ngila Dickson is splendid. The production design by Lilly Kilvert is incredibly beautiful. The film editing by Steven Rosenblum and Victor du Bois is excellent. The cinematography by John Toll is brilliant. The music by Hans Zimmer is powerful and brilliantly excellent. The story & screenplay by John Logan, Marshall Herskovitz, & Edward Zwick is emotionally powerful and brilliant. Go see this movie and it might inspire you and make you think about things in perspective. See it before you see ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King"" in theaters everywhere.

I subsequently read reviews that claimed that it was in fact a great movie, a cut above as it were, and that the movie was sensitive towards Japanese culture etc.  In particular what I found most interesting was the claim that the movie was not the typical Western film where Western values are proven superior--that the reverse is in fact the case here.  But still, I was sceptical, and did not concern myself with the movie until just a few days ago.  All things considered, I think I was justified in my scepticism; while there were aspects that I found to be good and commendable (the majestic landscape, quite stunning combat sequences), for the most part I just did not find it to be a good film.

All of the big named male actors such as Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe had their epic war movies and Tom Cruise was sorely due for one and in this movie he chose very well.  Over the years, like many super stars, Tom Cruise has chosen some extremely good roles and at the other end of the spectrum he's done some very poor movies but with &quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; the part couldn't have been better for him as it was supremely suited to his talents.Along with the superior performance given by Tom Cruise, his co-actors in Timothy Spall, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada and Koyuki and so many others added greatly to the overall feel of the movie through their performances which were all of great depth and feeling.Over the years, Edward Zwick has directed some of the finest movies to ever grace the silver screen such as &quot;Glory&quot; and &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; and &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; serves well to his legacy by being added to his library of exceptional films.  Additional credit goes to Hans Zimmer for the score for this outstanding film.The Premise:Civil War hero Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has seen all too well the horrors of war and the policies of the American government in both dealing with soldiers of the south and especially Native Americans.  He is essentially forced into going to Japan to fight for the government against the Samurai that have for so long defended Japan but are now anachronistic in their eyes.  In a twist of fate, he is forced to lead his forces against the Samurai before they are ready and his forces are easily routed and he is captured.Feeling merciful and wanting to learn more about his new enemy, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) spares his life and takes him to his village for the winter.  Captain Algren spends that time there and suddenly finds a rebirth...What follows from there is an exceptional film both in its touching and intriguing story and the extraordinary battle scenes.

808211,A329ALHKYK62O7,B0001JXOUS,Ky. Col.,"[2, 2]","""The Last Samurai"" is loosely based on an actual rebellion in nineteenth century Japan.  In the film, the Japanese government hire a number of U.S. cavalry veterans as advisors for their new army including the highly decorated captain played by Tom Cruise.  The captain however is an alcoholic struggling with a massacre he participated in at an Indian village.  Soon after arriving in Japan the unprepared Japanese regiment is overwhelmed by a highly disciplined force of Samurai fighting to preserve their old customs.  Wounded and captured, Cruise comes face to face with a vastly different culture.  Ironically both he and the Samurai leader played by Japanese actor Ken Watanabe come to respect and learn much from one another; eventually they fight together as allies against a considerably better trained and equipped government force.Overall I greatly enjoyed the film.  The acting is very good (especially from the Japanese actors but Cruise plays his role quite well).  As usual Hans Zimmer delivers a very good muscial score.  I confess that James Horner is probably my faovrite film composer but Zimmerman does exceptional work as well.  The cinematography and production values are superb (particularly regarding 1870s Tokyo and the main Samurai village).  The Battle scenes are very well coreographed.  There is a memorable scene in which the protagonists face a force of ninja assassins.  The final battle is tragically powerful as the rebels in full armor with katanas and bows face two Japanese regiments armed with howitzers, bolt-action rifles, and gatling guns.The film is for mature audiences as it clearly deserves its R rating during the violent combat scenes.  Parents should be aware there is some cursing as well (not considerably so for an R rated film though).  The depiction of Samurai culture is very interesting; although generally sympathetic towards their culture the film also shows that it was not without fault.  I would recommend the WWII film ""To End all Wars"" for a far more critical view of Bushido.  For those interested in further reading on Samurai military history, the British military historian Stephen Turnbull has written numerous books.",5,Violent but Beautiful,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,2185,"['Last', 'Samurai', 'loosely', 'based', 'actual', 'rebellion', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'Japan', 'film', 'Japanese', 'government', 'hire', 'number', 'U.S.', 'cavalry', 'veterans', 'advisors', 'new', 'army', 'including', 'highly', 'decorated', 'captain', 'played', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'captain', 'however', 'alcoholic', 'struggling', 'massacre', 'participated', 'Indian', 'village', 'Soon', 'arriving', 'Japan', 'unprepared', 'Japanese', 'regiment', 'overwhelmed', 'highly', 'disciplined', 'force', 'Samurai', 'fighting', 'preserve', 'old', 'customs', 'Wounded', 'captured', 'Cruise', 'face', 'face', 'vastly', 'different', 'culture', 'Ironically', 'Samurai', 'leader', 'played', 'Japanese', 'actor', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'come', 'respect', 'learn', 'much', 'one', 'eventually', 'fight', 'together', 'allies', 'considerably', 'better', 'trained', 'equipped', 'government', 'force.Overall', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'Cruise', 'role', 'quite', 'well', 'usual', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'very', 'good', 'muscial', 'score', 'confess', 'James', 'Horner', 'probably', 'faovrite', 'film', 'composer', 'Zimmerman', 'exceptional', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'cinematography', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'superb', 'particularly', 'regarding', '1870s', 'Tokyo', 'main', 'Samurai', 'village', 'Battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'coreographed', 'memorable', 'scene', 'protagonists', 'face', 'force', 'ninja', 'assassins', 'final', 'battle', 'tragically', 'powerful', 'rebels', 'full', 'armor', 'katanas', 'bows', 'face', 'two', 'Japanese', 'regiments', 'armed', 'howitzers', 'bolt-action', 'rifles', 'gatling', 'guns.The', 'film', 'mature', 'audiences', 'clearly', 'R', 'rating', 'violent', 'combat', 'scenes', 'Parents', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'cursing', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'considerably', 'so', 'R', 'rated', 'film', 'depiction', 'Samurai', 'culture', 'very', 'interesting', 'generally', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'culture', 'film', 'also', 'was', 'not', 'fault', 'would', 'recommend', 'WWII', 'film', 'End', 'Wars', 'far', 'more', 'critical', 'view', 'Bushido', 'interested', 'further', 'reading', 'Samurai', 'military', 'history', 'British', 'military', 'historian', 'Stephen', 'Turnbull', 'written', 'numerous', 'books']",N/A
808212,A3GYVMUS7SSDFW,B0001JXOUS,Kyle Tolle,"[1, 1]","The year is 1876.  Tom Cruise portrays Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War era soldier who is disillusioned with life and is haunted by his dishonorable actions perpetrated against the American Indian nations.  Facing an uncertain and directionless future, he is asked to travel to Japan to assist in training their Imperial army in modern combat using modern weapons.  This comes at a time in history when Japan is attempting to obliterate the Samurai system.After much training and eventually engaging in an initial battle against the Samurai, Captain Algren is taken prisoner by the enemy and thrust into the unfamiliar world of a Japanese feudal society.  In the following months of captivity, Captain Algren becomes immersed in the Samurai culture where he eventually adapts to and embraces the sacred code of honor known as Bushido.  Using what he has learned and regaining his self-respect and dignity, Captain Algren and the Samurai confront the Japanese army in an epic and final battle that will determine the survival or demise of the Samurai warrior class.I'm of the opinion that this role is not a career best for Tom Cruise but he does come across admirably and carries himself well.  The rest of the cast also performs very nicely and the story holds together for the movie's duration.  The cinematography, costumes, props, and scenery are all quite appealing through and through.  Open field battle scenes are beautifully choreographed and practically rival those of such movies as Braveheart, Glory, and The Patriot.In regards to the DVD itself, the sound and picture are crystal clear and a joy to experience.  The second disk in the set offers numerous special features which are both educational and entertaining alike.

When captured by the enemy, the American is asked to stick around for ""conversations"" with the leader of the samurai, who in turn, teaches the Yank a thing or two about life.The film is brilliant in that way because it allows us to connect our own tainted dreams, hopes and ambitions to Cruise's journey through the higher mindedness of the Samurai.talk about an amazing transformation and outlook on life. I always believed that much of that Zen stuff was just plain double-talk, but this film is amazing in both its depth of character interaction and preciseness of dialogue, through which great thought and resonance is placed upon every scene, every word and every action sequence. To that end, consider how almost every person who perished in this film affected me emotionally, during even its most violent scenarios. It's also to note that if actor Ken Watanabe, playing the all-powerful Katsumoto, doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for his part in this film, consider me to be the uncle of a monkey. And did I mention the film's intense and pointed musical score? Yup, Hans Zimmer is back with yet another perfect addition to the film's many strengths and a rousing score that was still buzzing in my head as I washed away the tears of the characters gone by. And before I forgot about one of the film's greatest attributes, consider its all-out sword-fighting, arrow-flinging all of which rival any other action scene from any film this year (which is saying quite a bit) and are pretty gosh-darn brutal to boot.

The love affair with Cruise and Taka is sweet but with Blackthorne and Mariko it was detailed, passionate, forbidden and conspiratorial.Likewise, the transition that Cruise makes into Japanese society is in fact, believable however it seems to happen swiftly. Too swiftly to remain completely credible. The script and Cruise's voiceover explains his love of the discipline and simplicity, which interestingly enough is what seduces Blackthorne. Well. Really seduces Blackthorne. But then again, it is Nathan that/who becomes a true warrior, and I must again give kudos to Cruise who appears believable in the great physicality of the Bushido spirit and the battle scenes.All in all a nice ride, sufficient enough to take it out of the 'manly men doing manly things' genre and allow you to think.Ken Wanatabe as Katsumoto is excellent and should have won him a best supporting. Taka is wonderful; the children are animated and innocent. The use of Cruise speaking Japanese was an excellent touch and again, seemed to add credibility.

808225,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0001JXOUS,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 3]","I enjoyed watching ""The Last Samurai"" again.  It's one of my daughter's favorites and was under the Christmas tree for her this year.Tom Cruise is the star.  He plays Nathan Algren, a veteran of wars with the American Indians and is haunted by atrocities committed.  We see numerous black and white flashbacks of women and children being shot by soldiers.  Being part Native American, I found these sequences particularly moving and disturbing.  So for me, Algren's depression that sent him to drink seemed quite believable.  Cruise does seem so determined that his acting at times seems a bit forced and calculated rather than an organic performance.  That said, he was nominated for Best Actor by the Golden Globes.Edward Zwick directed the picture and won the Best Director Award from the National Board of Review.  He has also directed ""Glory,"" ""The Siege,"" & ""Blood Diamond.""Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto shined in this picture.  He's the philosophic Samurai who leads the rebellion against technological compromises with the West.  He demonstrates intelligence, compassion and the rarest of all screen commodities, wisdom.  The final battle sequence is incredible.  He well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.  Tim Robbins took home the gold in that category forMystic River (Widescreen Edition).Tony Goldwyn who is the grandson of movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn (think MGM) plays the role of Col. Benjamin Bagley.  Goldwyn is still most associated as the bad guy in ""Ghost,"" and plays an arrogant soldier who despite his good looks is not sympathetic.Hiroyuki Sanada plays Ujio, the apparent second in command to Katsumoto.  Sanada has been nominated for five Best Actor awards from the Japanese Academy with two wins including one for his brilliant portrayal inThe Twilight Samurai.  He does an excellent job taking an instant dislike to Algren, battling him into the mud in a rainy day duel, and eventually coming to respect him after Nathan battles against the masked Ninja who attack their village.Smaller roles deserving of special mention are Koyuki's performance as Taka, who nurses Algren to health despite complaining that he smells like a pig.  She was in the Japanese film ""Pulse.""  Shichinosuke Nakamura plays the uncertain Emperor Meiji.  Sosuke Ikematsu does a delightful job as the young boy Higen who tries to be tough like a Samurai, but can shed a tear.  Director Masato Harada makes an acting appearance as Omura who wants to bring railroads and Western weapons to Japan.  Shin Koyamada is a good looking young actor.  He plays Nobutada who takes a number of arrows on his escape on the bridge and brings humor and determination to his screentime.  Billy Connolly who was Uncle Monty in ""Lemony Snicket"" plays the gray-haired Zebulon Grant who stands by Algren and suffers a fatal wound in the first battle.

It's set in the late 19th Century, where Tom Cruise, a veteran of the Civil War as well as some cruel Indian massacres, goes to Japan to train the Emperor's army against the Samurai so that Japan can modernize.  That's an oversimplification of this politically correct story for which I have seen no claims of being historically accurate.Soon, Cruise is captured by the Samurai and, learns to respect them.  Ken Watanabe is the Samurai leader who believes in honor and all that other good stuff as compared to the avaricious Americans.

808234,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B0001JXOUS,Lleu Christopher,"[1, 2]","The Last Samurai is typical of epic Hollywood war-action/adventure films --impressive scenery, musical score and battle scenes, yet bogged down in cliches and contrived situations. Tom Cruise plays Captain Algren, an 1870s war hero who is tormented by memories of brutal battles against Indians. He is persuaded to travel to Japan to train the army to fight against the samurai, Japan's traditional warriors. The Japanese government, motivated by financial reasons, wants to modernize and develop relations with the West; the samurai, who represent Japan's noble cultural and warrior heritage, resist these changes.Algren is not given sufficient time to properly train the army in the ways of modern warfare; he is forced to confront the samurai, who defeat the modern army with their discipline and ferocity. This is where the film lost me. Algren himself is only captured after single-handedly fighting off something like a dozen samurai warriors. It is of course a cliche of martial arts movies that the hero can take on countless opponents, but this film is more ambitious and attempts to be realistic, and it is absurd to imagine a man untrained in these traditional martial arts defeating all of these elite warriors with their own weapons. At this point, I was resigned to watching a generic Tom Cruise action hero rather than a believable character.Algren is captured and allowed to recuperate so that the samurai might learn something of their enemy (there had to be some excuse for letting him live). He is even trained in their martial arts, which seems unlikely. Why would they train an enemy combatant? And the time it takes him to learn to fight with their weapons only highlights how unrealistic it was that he was unbeatable in his first battle (where he would more likely have been killed). Algren predictably comes to admire the samurai way of life and eventually sympathizes with their struggle. The film attempts to examine the complex issue of preserving traditions in a rapidly changing world. This is largely expressed in conversations between Algren and a samurai named Katsumoto (well played by Ken Watanabe). A woman named Taka (Koyuki) is the inevitable love interest, as the wife of a man Algren killed in battle. She struggles between her grief and growing fondness for Algren.Although some of the interaction between Algren and Katsumoto is interesting, the film has a basic contradiction that it never really resolves.  It is superficially a sympathetic exploration of a traditional culture, yet at the same time it revels in the stereotype of the Great White Man who travels to distant lands and saves the day, a book and movie tradition that goes back at least as far as Kipling, where British colonists tamed the ""primitive"" people of Africa and Asia. Again, The Last Samurai seems to be more on the side of the colonized, yet this is belied by the huge role played by the Tom Cruise character.Perhaps the most effective scene in the film is the last battle, where we see a rapid-firing cannon mowing down samurai warriors. This image is a stark image of modern society mechanically wiping out a less technologically advanced culture. Unfortunately, I didn't find most of the film equal to this theme. I think a better portrayal of a similar story can be found in the miniseries (based on a novel by James Clavell)  Shogun.",3,"Some good scenes, but not quite credible",1083888000,"05 7, 2004",2004,3357,"['Last', 'Samurai', 'typical', 'epic', 'Hollywood', 'war-action/adventure', 'films', 'impressive', 'scenery', 'musical', 'score', 'battle', 'scenes', 'yet', 'bogged', 'down', 'cliches', 'contrived', 'situations', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Captain', 'Algren', '1870s', 'war', 'hero', 'who', 'tormented', 'memories', 'brutal', 'battles', 'Indians', 'persuaded', 'travel', 'Japan', 'train', 'army', 'fight', 'samurai', 'Japan', 'traditional', 'warriors', 'Japanese', 'government', 'motivated', 'financial', 'reasons', 'modernize', 'develop', 'relations', 'West', 'samurai', 'who', 'represent', 'Japan', 'noble', 'cultural', 'warrior', 'heritage', 'resist', 'changes.Algren', 'not', 'given', 'sufficient', 'time', 'properly', 'train', 'army', 'ways', 'modern', 'warfare', 'forced', 'confront', 'samurai', 'who', 'defeat', 'modern', 'army', 'discipline', 'ferocity', 'where', 'film', 'lost', 'Algren', 'only', 'captured', 'single-handedly', 'fighting', 'off', 'something', 'dozen', 'samurai', 'warriors', 'course', 'cliche', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'hero', 'can', 'take', 'countless', 'opponents', 'film', 'more', 'ambitious', 'attempts', 'be', 'realistic', 'absurd', 'imagine', 'man', 'untrained', 'traditional', 'martial', 'arts', 'defeating', 'elite', 'warriors', 'own', 'weapons', 'point', 'was', 'resigned', 'watching', 'generic', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'action', 'hero', 'rather', 'believable', 'character.Algren', 'captured', 'allowed', 'recuperate', 'so', 'samurai', 'might', 'learn', 'something', 'enemy', 'had', 'be', 'excuse', 'letting', 'live', 'even', 'trained', 'martial', 'arts', 'unlikely', 'Why', 'would', 'train', 'enemy', 'combatant', 'time', 'learn', 'fight', 'weapons', 'only', 'how', 'unrealistic', 'was', 'was', 'unbeatable', 'first', 'battle', 'where', 'would', 'more', 'likely', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'Algren', 'predictably', 'admire', 'samurai', 'way', 'life', 'eventually', 'struggle', 'film', 'attempts', 'examine', 'complex', 'issue', 'preserving', 'traditions', 'rapidly', 'changing', 'world', 'largely', 'expressed', 'conversations', 'Algren', 'samurai', 'named', 'Katsumoto', 'well', 'played', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'woman', 'named', 'Taka', 'Koyuki', 'inevitable', 'love', 'interest', 'wife', 'man', 'Algren', 'killed', 'battle', 'grief', 'growing', 'fondness', 'Algren.Although', 'interaction', 'Algren', 'Katsumoto', 'interesting', 'film', 'basic', 'contradiction', 'never', 'really', 'superficially', 'sympathetic', 'exploration', 'traditional', 'culture', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'stereotype', 'Great', 'White', 'Man', 'who', 'distant', 'lands', 'day', 'book', 'movie', 'tradition', 'back', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'Kipling', 'where', 'British', 'colonists', 'tamed', 'primitive', 'people', 'Africa', 'Asia', 'Again', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'be', 'more', 'side', 'colonized', 'yet', 'belied', 'huge', 'role', 'played', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'most', 'effective', 'scene', 'film', 'last', 'battle', 'where', 'see', 'rapid-firing', 'cannon', 'mowing', 'down', 'samurai', 'warriors', 'image', 'stark', 'image', 'modern', 'society', 'mechanically', 'wiping', 'out', 'less', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'culture', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'most', 'film', 'equal', 'theme', 'think', 'better', 'portrayal', 'similar', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'miniseries', 'based', 'novel', 'James', 'Clavell', 'Shogun']",N/A

It tells the story of the Samurai of Japan and how they became obsolete due to westernization of their country.  Although the last scene with the emperor concerning his decision whether to fully open Japan to the West is pure fiction, the rest is generally accurate.  The director seeks to romanticize the samurai.  The samurai traditions and culture are not that difficult to romanticize.  Everything they stood for is portrayed in the film.  Watching it, you yearn to add these values to your own life, and feel achingly their loss to today's society.  This is the true value of the film - to raise the samurai once again, in their full glory of life, and the strange glory of their deaths.The climactic scene of the final battle between the samurai and the new army is predictable, yet still horrifying.  You just wish it could end differently.  Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are glorious.  Watanabe received a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  I feel The Last Samurai should have received more nominations, and at least one Oscar.In real life, the last of the samurai did indeed perish in a last-stand battle against the new military.

808236,A3NZVCL9N8CLHB,B0001JXOUS,"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True""","[2, 2]","The modern landscape of hollywood can leave many of us quite depressed with a great void within us. We yearn for movies of subtance. Movies that have some soul... movies that make you think and feel, all while keeping you entertained. The effects laden, poorly scripted, commericial marketing schemes that pass as movies these days leave me for one wondering what happeend to the days when movie making was an art and not a franchise.But then, just as all hope seems lost along comes a movie like this to renew my faith in hollywood's abillity to put together a masterpiece.The Last Sammuri takes place in the late 19th century, as america is in the end of the Indian wars (just after Custer's defeat at little big horn). At this time Japan is a nation undergoing remarkable change. The new Emperor has begun to modernize the formerly feudal nation at lightning speeds. Thus the stage is set in this oriental land for war between the old ways and the new ways. A rebellion of Sammuri warriors, who reject many of the new western ways has begun. The Japanese are at this time seeking advisors from all over the world to aid in thier modernization, including seeking military advisors from america to help train, update and lead the imperial army. An American Captain (Tom Cruise), a veteran of the indian wars, is hired towards this end - much thanks to the fact that he has experience fighting tribal leaders (the movie draws on the similarities between the sammuri and native american warriors). But Tom Cruise gets captured in the first encounter with the sammuri, and after living amongst these amazing people and learning thier ways, finds his own salvation in thier cause.The plot isn't very complicated, but is rich in historical context and philisophical themes. All the charcters in the movies are very well done, and the acting in this film with only a few minor exceptions was absolutley fantastic (especially the portrayal of Katsomoto, which was just a brilliant performance).The last sammuri has a little of everything. This is a movie that you will feel. You'll laugh, you'll be inspired, you'll be anxious, and you may even get a little watery eyed at some of the more tender moment. There's martial arts, humor, sword fighting, ninjas, battles, love, philosophy, drama - you name it. The movie has some great action sequences and battle scenes but these are not over-done - there is much more. The movie feels almost poetic at times, and the cinematogrophy is beautifully done. Many gorgeous shots are in the movie. And, unlike many movies, the slower scenes don't leave you yawning but are very well done.The music and audio too, was top notch, some of the best I've seen in a while.all in all this became one of my all time favorite movies the moment I saw it. Many of the ellements reminded me of a slightly less gritty version of brave heart.

Tom Cruise does a good job protraying a guilt-ridden American warrior who was reborn as samurai warrior. It probably helped that his co-star Ken Watanabe proves to be a superior actor and he probably pushed Cruise to the higher level of acting once they began to shared scenes together. On the whole, the movie will worked for most people watching it because it gives a very idealistic look at the Japanese samurai culture at its best.However, most of it proves to be pure historical fantasy at its best. You should never considered that this was the way it was back in Japan of 1876. Outdated armor and thinking are not the way of the Samurai. Samurai, like all warrior types, adjust and adapt to changing warfare. Anyone who even know a thing about the warring period of 1540 to 1615 understand that samurai went from bow and arrow to firearms proficiently very quickly. Where the movie take a major misstep is that while the spirit and teaching of the samurai is tradition based, fighting modes are not.But this is a Hollywood movie made for American taste and perception. This is how many Americans see the samurai warriors of the old and just the way the many foreigners see American history as one of wars between cowboys and Indians or black folks tipping their hats to the white folks, this movie catered to best of the sternotypes. There is nothing truly historical about this film. The movie was made in the same mode as Mel Gibson's Patriot and Braveheart, all entertainment but no history.Now this movie have been compared with Dances with Wolves and there seem to be some justice to that comparsion. Both shows how a lone white man surrounded by an alien culture, ""went native"" so to speak and aligned himself with that culture. Both movies introduced these alien cultures through that white man's perception and his inevitable acceptance and entrance to that culture.

I was attracted to the idea of an American soldier, as played by Tom Cruise, and a group of samurai.  However, what I discovered was a carbon copy of other works by director Edward Zwick, plus a little ""Dances With Wolves"" on the side.Let's see: Tom Cruise plays an outcast soldier who finds himself looking for redemption in the company of some samurai, who kidnap him while training some Japanese soldiers to fight against those samurai.  This is like Matthew Broderick, who plays a soldier and finds redemption by training and commanding a group of African-Americans in ""Glory"" -Zwick's best movie.  Also, it's similar to ""Legends Of The Fall"", where Brad Pitt plays a desertor from the Army during WWI and finds redemption with a group of indians.  So, in those Edward Zwick movies, we find outcast soldiers in Broderick, Pitt, and Cruise.  Ah, and let's not forget Kevin Costner, who also plays an outcast soldier who finds comfort with the Sioux in ""Dances With Wolves""; only Zwick didn't direct that movie, Costner did.However, not all in ""The Last Samurai"" is negative.  I have to admit that I fell in love with LOTR's Ngila Dickson's costumes; the cinematography by, I think, by Caleb Deschanel is truly enchanting; Ken Watanabe's outstanding performance as samurai leader Katsumoto is electrifying and charming at the same time; and, more importantly, Hans Zimmer's eclectic and marvelous music score, which I consider a great guilty pleasure of mine.In the end, I don't think ""The Last Samurai"" is a classic.

I can't get enough of this modern masterpice.Capt. Nathan Algren(Cruise) is an Army veteran. He's become an alcholic and hates himself and frequently has flashbacks over some of the Indians he's killed. He's falling apart and things don't look great for him until he's offered a job by the ambassador of Japan Umura(Hamada).The Emperor of Japan is modernizing the country and doing it very quickly. The Emperors former advisor Katsumota(Watanabe) doesn't like the old ways and is doing everything in his power to delay them. He is one of the greatest Samurai to ever live and is well respected and loved by his people. Umura nows Japan can't beat him so he convinces the Emperor that they must modernize so they can defeat Katsumoto.Algren comes to Japan reluctantly. He hates Col. Bagley(Goldwyn) who is his superior officer in the operation. He's trying to train the Japanese men as fast as he can, but they don't have a enough time. Umura and Bagley order Algren to takes his men into battle against Katsumoto agains his will.The fight between the armies is quick and very bloody. Katsumoto captures Algren after seeing the passion and fire in his eyes during battle. They take Algren back to their village for winter so Katsumoto can get to learn his enemy better.Algren is treated fairly well by the people. They help him overcome his alcholism battle. He hates the place at first, but as he lives there and sees the discipline of the Samurai people he begins to accept and love their culture. He becomes friends with Katsumoto and gains respect from most of the village. Winter ends though and he must return to Tokyo.Upon his return to Tokyo he sees the advance of the Japanese army. Umora has increased the spending of Japan in their arms and it's obvious he has lots of influence over the emperor. Umora is determined to kill the Samurai and Katsumoto. After a scuffle in Tokyo Algren returns with the Samurai to help prepare them in their last stand against the Japanese army.The acting is phenomenal in this movie. Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are amazing in their roles as Algren and Katsumoto. Cruise plays the role with passion and intensity. He does a great job displaying the change that Algren takes emotionaly and physically. He really did get cheated by not getting an Oscar nomination. This guy has done a lot for the movie industry and the academy but they continue to not pay him back. Cruise almost didn't do this movie because of his commitment to Cold Mountain. They didn't give the money he wanted so he became The Last Samurai.Ken Watanabe really shines in this picture. He isn't intimidated by Cruise at all and is equal if not better to him. He becomes Katsumoto and is amazing. He's funny, brave, charming, and smart all at the same time. He deserved the Oscar nomination he received and probaly should have won it. I'm excited about seeing Ken in the new Batman movie. This guy is great.Edward Zwick really does a great job with this movie. The Last Samurai is produced by Cruises production company and they were the only man they wanted to direct this. Zwick has plenty of experience in this area of movies with Glory on his resume. He shots this movie well and it's all done in tastes. The fight scenes are shot especially well. The camera angles are great and we really get a good idea of how the Samurai fought. The violence isn't over done and you see the art that is sword play. Zwick has made a masterpiece.A lot of people have bashed the ending of the movie. They think it's sappy and to happy. It's anything but that. If you pay attention to the movie and realize that Algren didn't fail his mission he has no shame. Algren loved Katsumoto and so did the Emperor so thats why we have that scene at the ending of the well. I found it to be a powerful ending to a dynamic film.This is a great movie. It's so well made and attention is paid in it to the tiniest details. This movie will stay with you for days and all the good dramas do. If you like dramas or war films than you must see this film. If you love Tom Cruise you have to pick this one up.

808260,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B0001JXOUS,M. Burns,"[2, 3]","The enduring spirit of master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa is alive and well in Edward Zwick's gorgeous, moving The Last Samurai. Wait, am I talking about a Tom Cruise movie? Why yes! And what a refreshing, vibrant, and even spiritual film this is. Through the movie's somewhat formulaic plot of the washed-up war hero with skeletons in the closet coming to learn the way of the samurai is a movie done truly in a classic Hollywood fashion. John Toll's cinematography is tear-inducingly brilliant in every frame, Hanz Zimmer's lush score proves haunting, and even Mr. Cruise creates a stunning, believable character arc as Nathan Algren, imprisoned by his samurai enemies, but eventually in love with the beauty and the legend of the art. There were elements of the film I wanted to dislike: Algren's voice-over narration that slides occasionally into cliche, the film's Hollywood ending, and a third act that begins to test patience. But Samurai is such an immensely satisfying experience (especially in its quaint, beautiful midsection where Algren comes to accept his destiny as a warrior) that those things become mere quibbles along the way. I can't say that Samurai is a masterpiece on par with even the slightest of the great samurai films, but it evokes a fondness for filmmaking to which I wish more filmmakers, like Zwick, would return more often. It's long, it's epic, it's a tear-jerker, and the battle scenes are so alive you have to blink twice. Call me a sucker for loving this beautiful, flawed movie, but try to resist it yourself.

It was in January of the year 1867 that the last Japanese shgun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, was appointed.  Following the assassination of his closest friend in September, Tokugawa Yoshinobu restored authority to the Imperial House in November to Emperor Meiji and the Edo Period came to an official end.  In January of the following year (1868), forces loyal to Tokugawa Yoshinobu were defeated by Imperialist forces near Osaka, but continued to plague the Emperor's rule.  In May, Emperor Meiji placed Tokugawa Yoshinobu under house arrest, Edo was renamed Tokyo, and in July, the last of the Tokugawa Yoshinobu loyalists were defeated.  Several years later in 1876, Emperor Meiji criminalized the wearing of swords.  Another brief rebellion followed in 1877 that was lead by Saigo Takamori.  Called the Satsuma Rebellion, Imperialist forces crushed the rebellion in November 1877.It is the man Saigo Takamori who is the basis for the main character of Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) in the 2003 film of ""The Last Samurai"", which recreates a fictionalized version of the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877 that includes the assistance of a captured American mercenary, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), who is hired by the Japanese Imperial Court to help train their newly-established army.  Created by writer John Logan, the character Nathan Algren is a former U.S. Army captain that witnessed many battles against Native Americans, including a few massacres of women and children.  He turns to alcohol to help him deal with the ongoing nightmares of those battles; i.e., delayed stress syndrome.  In the first battle that the ill-prepared Japanese army mounts against the Katsumoto loyalists, Nathan is captured and taken to the village where Katsumoto and his followers live.  Taken care of by the wife of a samurai that Nathan killed during the battle, Taka (Koyuki), who is also Katsumoto's sister, Nathan slowly begins to understand the people that had been his enemy and develops an interesting relationship with Katsumoto, as well as Taka, her sons and Katsumoto's son Nobutada (Shin Koyamada).  Invited to meet with Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura), Katsumoto, Nathan and a large group of Katsumoto's followers travel to Tokyo. There, Nathan meets again with the man he hates most, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), as well as the minister to Emperor Meiji who hired Nathan to begin with: Omura (Masato Harada).  However, Nathan's time in the village has altered his perceptions before the biggest battle of the film begins.With superb cinematography, as well as excellent sets and costumes that are consistent with late nineteenth-century Japan and America, ""The Last Samurai"" is a beautiful, yet tragic film.  The film earned four Oscar nominations: Ken Watanabe for Best Supporting Actor, as well as nominations for Best Set/Art Decoration, Best Sound and and Best Costume Design.  Tom Cruise's portrayal of Nathan Algren was one of his best performances as he took upon a role that was quite different from his typical arrogant, egocentric characters of past films.  Instead, we see a character that is emotional and more interested in others, something that I would not have expected from Cruise.  Overall, I rate the 2003 ""The Last Samurai"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  Writer John Logan and director Edward Zwick did an excellent job of creating a plausible story based upon an actual Japanese historical event.",5,"""Tell me how he died.""

808266,A2IRATR53843WU,B0001JXOUS,M,"[28, 38]","The only redeeming features of this movie are great sets, excellent cinematograpy, and fantastic battle sequences.  And the Japanese actor, who was great and should have won an academy award for best supporting actor (the normally excellent Tim Robbins somehow won for a shockingly poor performance in Mystic River).  The entire premise of the film, though, is preposterous.  Would American audiences praise a film that reconstructs history so as to idealize the slave society of the south?  Of course not.  And especially not if the characters were as poorly-drawn as those in Last Samurai.  But that's essentially what happens here.  Look, there are tons of films that idealize a more pastoral, simpler way of life and condemn the evils of modernity.  They don't have to be bad.  But when they're &quot;historical&quot; but instead based on out-and-out lies, the impact is somewhat diminished.  The fact is, the Samurai in Japan were not the keepers of wonderful traditions and Meiji Japan did not sell out its values to become Westernized.  The Samurai system was feudal and perpetuated great evils and injustices to befall the average person.  In 19th century, many Samurai had regressed to performing few serivices at all and lived lives fattening themselves on the government coffers at the expense of the toiling peasants.  The Japanese emperor saw that his society was brutally backward and did a magnificent service to his country by becoming modern as quickly as possible.  Many Samurai, upset that their caste system and free lunches were coming to an end, rebelled.  The Last Samurai is the story of this rebellion, and all its box-office hopes were pinned on the assumption that Americans are so ignorant of Asian history that they would have no idea that what they were watching was a perversion of history similar to a bunch of plantation owners being idealized as the keepers of traditional values.  The politics of a film, itself, should not be the determining factor of its worth and had this merely been an action film perhaps some of the historical liberties would be more excusable.  But it isn't merely an action film; the director pounds the seriousness and gravity of the situation into the audience's skulls with nearly every scene.  Thus, the film's false premises make the situation appear all the more ludicrous.  Watch the film if you must -- then read up on Japanese history.

Thank God I did because it really is a good film.  Sure there are a lot of bad things some people could say about it just to be mean - I hated a lot of the editing in the beginning and that goofy fat guy from Harry Potter Prisoner From Azkaban is terrible in it (most people I know just can't stand Tom Cruise - which is unfortunate because he is  a MUCH better actor than most people give him credit for).  The whole movie is carefully balanced by tremendous action sequences in the middle and final section of the film and the sympathetic Japanese characters (Watanabe, the love interest, the kids etc...). They are all so believable and easy to connect to.  Some of the negative reviews on here (Amazon) are criticizing Cruise's performance harshly and the role his character plays in influencing the samurai/japanese people etc...Really it is Cruise's character though who learns in this movie and not the other way around which the trailer for this film so mistakenly conveyed...And unfortunately prevented me from seeing it in the theater.  And believe me when I say that I am the LAST person to want to see some movie about a ""white man"" (let alone one of the biggest american movie stars in the world) showing some bada#$ ""samurai"" how its done in the skills of fighting...But the film works people.  It isn't Gladiator or Braveheart but the characters are interesting and compelling, and many of the action sequences are truly suspenseful and entertaining...Even rousing at times.  The biggest problem I had with it was the opening (for awhile it was beginning to feel like a poor man's version of ""Glory"" - a perfect film in my mind which Edward Zwick also directed).  This isn't ""Glory"" but it isn't bad either.  Cruise is one of the best actors out there I've decided after watching this film.  People like calling him a ""vanity"" actor because he's such a major star and that he does roles that are in most cases larger than life...But what actor out there can honestly say they don't want that?  And besides he has done a wide array of roles and is surprisingly transformational...I say ""surprisingly"" simply because more people don't want to admit or recognize it...Think about how different he is in this from Born On The Fourth Of July or Collateral or Eyes Wide Shut or Color Of Money or Magnolia or Minority Report...The guy has some serious range people.  Don't be jealous 'cuz he's rich and good looking and has worked with some of the best directors ever (i.e. Oliver Stone, Kubrick, Spielberg, Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Tony Scott, Michael Mann).  Life's too short for that kinda talk people.

808268,AT393OR1JTYNR,B0001JXOUS,Miami Nights,"[15, 38]","This movie is typical of Hollywood's catering to the lowest common denominators. It's a movie for ignorant, non-thinking Americans who know nothing of medieval Japan and samurai history. It's all surface and no heart. Directed by Ed Zwick, who did a rather great job with ""Glory"" back in the 1980s, ""Last Samurai"" could almost be seen as ""Glory: Japan."" It's not a bad film, but too much Tom Cruise screen time, a lack of substance, and too many Hollywood cliches weight it down. In ""Glory,"" we at least got to know about four or five of the ""minority"" characters, and that we saw them outside of the main, white character's viewpoint, but in ""Last Samurai,"" we don't see any of the Japanese characters from outside of Tom Cruise's character's perspective and as a result, we never really get to know the Japanese characters, their personalities, their motivations, what drives them, etc. etc. Inexplicably, and as is typical of Hollywood movies, the white character is in some position of influence, and far too quickly rises up in the ranks and is practically put on a level with one of the highest ranking ""minority"" leaders. If only we got to know the Japanese characters, from Ujio to Katsumoto to Taka, from outside the confines of Aldren's eyes. As it is, it's merely a visual, superficial flick that leaves the viewer with cliches in mind, as once again, a white character is made the center of action in what should be a story about Japanese (or minority) characters -- rather, they're pushed to the sidelines in their own story. And the movie is almost sunk by unrealistic action sequences which almost border on corny, and a romantic tension that is laughingly unrealistic and unlikely. Lastly, reflective of Hollywood's Eurocentricism, some of the main Japanese characters are played by Asian actors with rather Eurocentric features, especially the actors who play the female lead Taka and her main son. In Hollywood, minorities, in this case Japanese people can't look commonly Japanese and be main characters or sympathized with -- they often must look white.",1,"Weak offering, too much Tom Cruise screen time",1070668800,"12 6, 2003",2003,2073,"['movie', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'catering', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominators', 'movie', 'ignorant', 'non-thinking', 'Americans', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'medieval', 'Japan', 'samurai', 'history', 'surface', 'heart', 'Directed', 'Ed', 'Zwick', 'who', 'did', 'rather', 'great', 'job', 'Glory', 'back', '1980s', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'seen', 'Glory', 'Japan', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'screen', 'time', 'lack', 'substance', 'too', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'cliches', 'weight', 'down', 'Glory', 'least', 'got', 'know', 'four', 'five', 'minority', 'characters', 'saw', 'main', 'white', 'character', 'viewpoint', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'perspective', 'result', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'personalities', 'motivations', 'what', 'etc', 'etc', 'Inexplicably', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'white', 'character', 'position', 'influence', 'far', 'too', 'quickly', 'up', 'ranks', 'practically', 'put', 'level', 'one', 'highest', 'ranking', 'minority', 'leaders', 'only', 'got', 'know', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'Ujio', 'Katsumoto', 'Taka', 'confines', 'Aldren', 'eyes', 'merely', 'visual', 'superficial', 'flick', 'viewer', 'cliches', 'mind', 'once', 'again', 'white', 'character', 'made', 'center', 'action', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'story', 'Japanese', 'minority', 'characters', 'rather', ""'re"", 'pushed', 'sidelines', 'own', 'story', 'movie', 'almost', 'sunk', 'unrealistic', 'action', 'sequences', 'almost', 'border', 'corny', 'romantic', 'tension', 'laughingly', 'unrealistic', 'unlikely', 'Lastly', 'reflective', 'Hollywood', 'Eurocentricism', 'main', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'Asian', 'actors', 'rather', 'Eurocentric', 'features', 'especially', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'female', 'lead', 'Taka', 'main', 'son', 'Hollywood', 'minorities', 'case', 'Japanese', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'commonly', 'Japanese', 'be', 'main', 'characters', 'sympathized', 'often', 'must', 'look', 'white']",N/A
808269,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B0001JXOUS,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[10, 11]","The notion of Honor is as far removed from our current everyday existence than the idea of a beleaguered Civil War Colonel (Tom Cruise) going to Japan in 1876 to train the Emperor&#65533;s Army in the new way of fighting an enemy: that is with guns and cannons and without swords.In these modern times, we have put ideals like Honor, Obedience to a Code of Ethics and Allegiance to an Ideal in little boxes and placed them on a shelf along with our copies of Lincoln&#65533;s speeches and Aristotle&#65533;s &#65533;Poetics.&#65533; They are available but unread.In the world of &#65533;The Last Samurai,&#65533; we see an honorable though innocent world in which a man&#65533;s word is his badge of honor and to break it is tantamount to death.Nathan Algren (Cruise) is a defeated man, both in spirit and in health: he has committed untold atrocities in the name of the Union Army which haunt him so much that gallons of whiskey do little to quell the pain. Cruise plays Algren with a heretofore untapped (except maybe in &#65533;The Fourth of July&#65533;) reservoir of pain and inner fire. Cruise is so much of a contemporary man that he usually has trouble making anything other than that believable. But here he is simply magnificent: psychically conflicted, physically stooped over by, not only his consumption of alcohol but by unresolved pain and guilt: his Algren has an inner life consumed by self disgust and revulsion that director Edward Zwick shows us in flashbacks of such power that they invoke horror in our hearts.Algren is captured by a group of contra Samurai, trying to hold onto their ideal world and while being held captive, learns the ways of the Samurai that he eventually adopts as superior to what he has experienced in his life up to this point. His chief captor, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) is fascinated by Algren and his reputation as a first class soldier, but in the end it is Algren that learns more from Katsumoto than vice versa. Algren experiences a world with the Samurai that he knows is doomed, because of and despite its adherence to a code of ethics based on human and humane principles that he recalls from his life in the U.S. before the Civil War. And in many ways this break from the feudal to the modern in Japan is very much like our break, after the Civil War from an agrarian society to an urban based modern one: from the innocent to the worldly, from keeping things outside our borders to inviting them in.As a whole, &#65533;The Last Samurai&#65533; is breathtaking to watch but the scenes of hand-to-hand combat are thrilling: gruesome yet beautiful. And the last charge of the last battle of the film works, not only on the level of an unmatched fight between the old guard (the Samurai) and the new (an army outfitted with rifles) but on the cosmic level as a symbol of the last dying hope of an honorable world in a last desperate gasp of a conflict with the new, modern world, hell bent on proving its superiority yet obviously lacking in moral fiber and resolve.&#65533;The Last Samurai&#65533; gives us a glimpse into the feudal yet honorable world of the Samurai: a world in which a man was judged by his character, his love of family and friends and his good deeds and not by his bank account or the size of his stock portfolio.

808270,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B0001JXOUS,Michael A. Newman,"[4, 9]","In the tradition of the Shogun miniseries, this movie paints a wonderful picture of life under the Japanese Samurai.  This time it is during a time of modernization in Japan.  Railroads and factories are being built.  A Japanese army is being started, armed by some US entrepenuers.  They hire Tom Cruise, an often drunk army captain, to go to Japan and train the army in the use of the new rifles and to learn American war tactics.He starts training troops that can't hit a stationary target at all.  He is told that there is an uprising against the Japanese emperor by a band of Samurai.  Cruise is to take the vastly inexperience troops to kill them.  Cruise complains that they are not ready but he is told to leave immediately.Cruise's regiment is easily wiped out by the attacking Samurai and Cruise himself puts up an enormous fight.  He is badly wounded but keeps fighting until he is unconscious.  Just before passing out, he kills one of the most fearsome Samurai warriors.The head Samurai, fascinated to learn more about Cruise, spares him and sends Cruise to mend at his sister's house.  His sister just happens to be the wife of the fallen warrior.Everyone in the village hates Cruise, and the woman is repulsed by the foreigner, who has shamed her by killing her husband.  Little by little, Cruise becomes fascinated with life in the village and the Samurai training.  He feels at peace and is cured of his alcoholic addiction.  As he becomes more skilled with the sword he starts to win the admiration of the Samurai and he bonds with the woman's son.Cruise finally, earns his place in the village by being instrumental in driving back a ninja attack on the village.  Eventually, Cruise will have to face the emperor's army now armed with cannon and fully training in using rifles.Great directing, action, and a riveting story.

808271,A2DGSWAKU0VB4P,B0001JXOUS,Michael Clarkson,"[1, 3]","The Last Samurai does many things exactly right, but falls short in a few key respects. It's a great action movie, and passable as a drama. That's a shame, because it could have been great on both counts.The major problem with this movie is that the main character is played by Tom Cruise. This isn't because I think he's a bad actor; in fact, I think he does a pretty good job with his role in this film. However, a white man was totally unnecessary here -- this movie would have been much better off as a story dealing only with the Japanese. The assimilation that occurs here strains credulity, and certainly Ken Watanabe, in a sterling performance as Katsumoto, could have carried a film himself. The fact that the presence of Cruise is a necessary concession to the target audience makes it forgivable, but not likable.Things would have been better if Cruise's character, Algren, were better explored by the film. Unfortunately, although Cruise does his best, the writers don't seem to know what to do with Algren. Though his transformation is the heart of this story, we never really come to understand who Algren was at the beginning, and have only a vague idea of who he has become at the end. Even his journal entries, poorly narrated by Cruise, grant us little insight. We are merely left to take for granted that Algren would come to respect, rather than resent, his captors. Why Algren takes a more enlightened approach to other cultures than his American peers is also a mystery.This lack of insight into Algren should be contrasted with Katsumoto, whose motivations, though convoluted by modern standards, are fully explicated.In other respects, this film succeeds greatly, and masterfully avoids falling into most of the Hollywood traps. There's no sex scene, no pointless explosions, and in many ways, no happy ending. The battle scenes are wonderfully shot, and the setting is excellently delineated. The emotional interplay between Cruise and his Japanese counterparts is good in most instances, though there are a few moments that falter. And Katsumoto's final scene is powerful and moving, an excellent note on which to end a movie.Unfortunately, they didn't go straight from there to the film's epilogue. Instead, they tacked on an additional scene with Algren and the emperor, in which the dialogue consisted almost entirely of cliches, and the young Emperor (jarringly) speaks in idiomatic American English. It's crap, and it comes at the end of the movie, where it does the most damage.If you can convince yourself to forget that awful piece of filmmaking, however, The Last Samurai has some resonance, a moving story, and compelling characters. Katsumoto in particular is one of the most interesting characters to come onscreen in recent years, and I cannot stress enough how well Ken Watanabe plays him. This movie is worth renting just to see his intense performance. If you're a fan of samurai films in general, it's probably worth a buy. It's far from the quality of a Kurosawa epic, but The Last Samurai is a much better film than your average Hollywood blockbuster.",4,"Many good points, and a few very bad",1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,3096,"['Last', 'Samurai', 'many', 'things', 'exactly', 'right', 'short', 'few', 'key', 'respects', 'great', 'action', 'movie', 'passable', 'drama', 'shame', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'counts.The', 'major', 'problem', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Tom', 'Cruise', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'actor', 'fact', 'think', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'film', 'However', 'white', 'man', 'was', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'here', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'story', 'dealing', 'only', 'Japanese', 'assimilation', 'here', 'strains', 'credulity', 'certainly', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'sterling', 'performance', 'Katsumoto', 'could', 'have', 'carried', 'film', 'fact', 'presence', 'Cruise', 'necessary', 'concession', 'target', 'audience', 'forgivable', 'not', 'likable.Things', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Cruise', 'character', 'Algren', 'were', 'better', 'explored', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'Cruise', 'best', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Algren', 'transformation', 'heart', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'come', 'understand', 'who', 'Algren', 'was', 'beginning', 'have', 'only', 'vague', 'idea', 'who', 'become', 'end', 'Even', 'journal', 'entries', 'poorly', 'narrated', 'Cruise', 'grant', 'little', 'insight', 'are', 'merely', 'left', 'take', 'granted', 'Algren', 'would', 'come', 'respect', 'rather', 'resent', 'captors', 'Why', 'Algren', 'more', 'enlightened', 'approach', 'other', 'cultures', 'American', 'peers', 'also', 'mystery.This', 'lack', 'insight', 'Algren', 'should', 'be', 'contrasted', 'Katsumoto', 'motivations', 'though', 'convoluted', 'modern', 'standards', 'are', 'fully', 'explicated.In', 'other', 'respects', 'film', 'greatly', 'masterfully', 'avoids', 'falling', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'traps', 'sex', 'scene', 'pointless', 'explosions', 'many', 'ways', 'happy', 'ending', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'shot', 'setting', 'excellently', 'delineated', 'emotional', 'interplay', 'Cruise', 'Japanese', 'counterparts', 'good', 'most', 'instances', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'falter', 'Katsumoto', 'final', 'scene', 'powerful', 'moving', 'excellent', 'note', 'end', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'straight', 'there', 'film', 'epilogue', 'Instead', 'tacked', 'additional', 'scene', 'Algren', 'emperor', 'dialogue', 'consisted', 'almost', 'entirely', 'cliches', 'young', 'Emperor', 'jarringly', 'idiomatic', 'American', 'English', 'crap', 'end', 'movie', 'where', 'most', 'damage.If', 'can', 'convince', 'forget', 'awful', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'however', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'resonance', 'moving', 'story', 'compelling', 'characters', 'Katsumoto', 'particular', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'come', 'onscreen', 'recent', 'years', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'how', 'well', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'movie', 'worth', 'renting', 'just', 'see', 'intense', 'performance', ""'re"", 'fan', 'samurai', 'films', 'general', 'probably', 'worth', 'buy', 'far', 'quality', 'Kurosawa', 'epic', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'average', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster']",N/A

Unfortunately, I am reading reviews from people that wanted a typical Tom Cruise action movie.  They were expecting a formula based on action, clever plot twists, and more action.  This does not require an effort to understand the beauty of another culture.  One reviewer complains that the Japanese actors were just being Japanese, and therefore not acting. After so many slice and dice 'em samurai movies, this one is a slice way above the rest.  Ken Watanabe starts the movie in deep meditation and having a vision.  His strong centeredness from meditation is carried through the entire film.  He did not get shaken by even the most insulting behavior from Cruise as Captain Algren.  This chemistry was special throughout the film.  This is a formula that includes real story telling, action, a demand to stretch your understanding, and more action.  Therefore, the reviews cite the action as good and the rest as bad.  I respect Tom Cruise a lot more now after seeing this movie, and knowing it became a personal project.

It is not (nor is it meant to be) historically accurate.  It is a dramatization about the conflict between the imperial army and the samurai in Japan.  The fact that the war actually happened was real, but the rest of it is made up and fictionalized.  If you can accept that about the movie, then you will likely enjoy it.  If you cannot, then you won't.The thing that makes this movie work so well is the acting.  It is, in my opinion the best I have ever seen Tom Cruise in (admittedly I have not seen all of his movies, so I cannot say whether it is his best performance ever).  His interactions with the Samurai leader played by Ken Watanabe, were wonderful.  This is really a film where all the actors from the ""main"" characters to the supporting actors all did their job wonderfully.  Yes, the love story was contrived and (SPOILER ALERT) having Tom Cruise's character live through the final battle was unrealistic, but overall I don't think those things detracted from the film as a whole.The A/V quality on blu ray is very very good.  What I loved about the movie is that very little was done via green screen, and the little that was, was blended in seamlessly so it did not look fake.  Most of the landscape shots were real, and were really brought out on blu ray.  For those who like the physical discs there are a ton of extras.  Mainly behind the scenes features, the a couple deleted scenes, a director's video journal and trailer.  In all the extras are almost as long as the movie itself.If you can suspend your disbelief and accept the provisos I stated at the beginning then I think you can find this movie enjoyable.

An envoy from Japan offers him a job training the Emperor's first modern army, which will be used to suppress an army of Samurai who are rebelling against the Imperial government's modernizing agenda. Mired in self-hatred and disgusted by the irony that killing is what he does best, Algren declares that he'll kill anyone for $500 a month and sails for Japan. Against his better judgment, Algren leads an ill-prepared regiment of novice soldiers against the Samurai, and he is captured. The leader of the Samurai, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), treats Algren well, ostensibly so that he may learn about his enemy. And Algren grows to respect this imposing man and the ancient traditions of the Samurai that Katsumoto is fighting to preserve in the face of a rapidly emerging modern Japan.""The Last Samurai"" is a terrific example of what Hollywood does best. It is a epic of legendary proportions. It sets the personal stories of a few heroic individuals against a sweeping and beautifully photographed historical background. It is a great story, but not a realistic one. It's a grandly entertaining myth. The Samurai culture is idealized. The characters speak not as real people would, but in moving and thoughtful monologues. Even when they are speaking to each other, they are actually speaking to the audience. But Hollywood does these larger-than-life tales like no one else, and ""The Last Samurai"" is epic filmmaking at its best.Tom Cruise is an obvious choice for such a large-scale project that requires that its cast have great screen presence so as not to be lost among the fantastic costumes and sets. Cruise's screen presence is up to the task, but I'm not sure his thespian skills are. Cruise's mannerisms are too modern for a man who grew up in the mid-19th century. But that is a minor flaw since ""The Last Samurai"" does not pretend to historical accuracy in its ideas, only in its environment. Tom Cruise is adequate here, but Ken Watanabe steals the show as Katsumoto, spiritual and military leader of the Samurai. His presence on screen is more than up to the film's epic proportions. I have rarely seen such charisma on a movie screen. He successfully embodies the concept of the warrior-poet in one character. I look forward to seeing more of Ken Watanabe in Western films, as well as Japanese. There are notable supporting performances from Koyuki as Taka, a woman who takes Algren into her home when he is injured and captured, and from Timothy Spall as a British translator.Much has been made of ""The Last Samurai""'s playing fast and loose with history. This is a film that aspires to bring an engrossing and monumental story to its audience before it aspires to accuracy in detail. My knowledge of Japanese history is sketchy at best. But it appears that the larger events of ""The Last Samurai"" are based in fact, while the details have been invented to serve the story. The rebellion of the Samurai and its great battle with the Imperial Army in the film closely resemble the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, in which the Satsuma Samurai, led by Saigo Takamori, engaged the Imperial Army. It turns out the way it did in real life, too. The film's Katsumoto is based on the very real Japanese hero Saigo Takamori, who helped usher the Shogunate out of power and restore the Imperial family to power before eventually leading an armed Rebellion against the Emperor on account of the policies of the Meiji Restoration, which instituted sweeping reforms intended to modernize Japan. The Meiji Restoration did make it illegal for the Samurai to wear topknots and swords, as we see depicted in the film. The government's Ministers did have more power than the Emperor Meiji, who served primarily as a symbol of national unity. So I would say that  the political climate and the major events depicted in ""The Last Samurai"" are real, while the story itself is not. Writer John Logan has used this environment to tell a story about the personal journey of an American and the clash between modern realities and traditional cultures.""The Last Samurai"" has often been compared to Kevin Costner's 1990 epic ""Dances With Wolves"". The two films are similar in that they are both about a disillusioned Civil War veteran who finds redemption and a sense of identity in a traditional culture that is on its way to extinction -or at least assimilation. But the Samurai were not harmless or innocent as the American Indians of ""Dances With Wolves"" may have been. The Samurai were politically influential and militarily powerful. And they were not marginalized after their defeat. Quite the contrary. ""The Last Samurai"" also departs from ""Dances With Wolves"" pacifist themes in asserting that the suppression of traditional cultures, by force if necessary, was necessary for Japan's survival in the modern world.I highly recommend ""The Last Samurai"" as an excellent example of signature epic filmmaking. It's a well-paced story that holds the audience's interest even at nearly 2 1/2 hours in length. Ken Watanable's performance is thoroughly enjoyable. The battle sequence is breath-taking and utterly spectacluar. It will even appeal to the martial arts crowd; there are lots of sword fights. It's a melange of history and fiction, but I see no reason to sweat the details since ""The Last Samurai"" isn't claiming to be anything more than that.",5,Grand & Entertaining Epic.

He reluctantly agrees to train and lead an army of Japanese soldiers to defeat rebellion of the country's remaining Samurai. Unfortunately, Algren is captured in battle by the Samurai, and is held prisoner by them. The leader of the Samurai, Katsumoto ( Ken Watanabe), is interested in the American culture and wants to keep Algren alive to learn from him. As time passes, Algren comes to develop a friendship with Katsumoto. He also comes to embrace the Samurai way of life as well, and trains to become one of them, so that he can fight along side of the Samurai against the Japanese forces that oppose them.With the acception of ""Mystic River"", ""The Last Samurai"" was my favorite film of 2003. For 2 1/2 hours, I was literally glued to the screen, and loving every minute of it. It has been quite some time since I have been that captivated by a film. The only downfall this film may have, is the fact that the story is almost a complete rip off of ""Dances with Wolves"". However, that does not make the film any less enjoyable. In fact, ""The Last Samurai"" is almost better. The story comes across as being much more dramatic and action packed when dealing with the Samurai. They have a deeper sense of honor, and their fighting style is much more deadly. Director Edward Zick did an amazing job of capturing every aspect of the Samurai culture, from the costume designs and simple way of life, to the weaponry and fighting style. The final battle between the Samurai and the Japanese soldiers is the best I have seen since ""Braveheart"". The Samurai are completely outnumbered, and still manage to put up one heck of a fight. Tom Cruise gave one of the best, if not the best performance of his career. However, the best performance of the film goes to Ken Watanabe. He was flat out amazing as Katsumoto and nailed every aspect of the Samurai warrior. The film's soundtrack and scenery are extremely beautiful as well.Overall, ""The Last Samurai"" is an amazing film. Every aspect of the Samurai way of life is captured accurately, the performances given by the actors involved were amazing, and the final battle was incredible. Also, please check out the extras listed by Amazon for this 2 Disc DVD set. From the look of things, the extras are reason enough to purchase this film. There are deleted scenes, featurettes on the making of the film, a featurette comparing real life Samurai, and more.

And most of the other epics have been staisfying as well, with ""Gladiator"" being but one standout.  But the Tom Cruise vehicle ""The Last Samurai"" it not one of the them.  Problems here start with the films bankable star.  The role of Nathan Algren is a challenging one, with emotional torture brewing behind his eyes and a sullen demanor in his walk.  But moments where Cruise hits these needed traits are few and far between.  Cruise plays Algren as a statue who poses as a heroic monolith for the camera, in other words Algren comes off as other characters Cruise has played in the past.  The only actor who stands out is Ken Watanabe, a Japanese actor who makes his english languange debut.  He brings a sense of dignity and intensity to the character of Katsumoto, a Samurai leader who is the last of a dying breed and a dying codePerhaps you can blame the films' director, Edward Zwick (Legends of the Fall, The Siege).  Zwick lets the film drag between inspired moments and the whole film seems  overlong and ponderous, not to mention derivative.  Screenwriter John Logan (Gladiator, The Aviator) borrows one too many plot details from other films that came before him, especially ""Dances With Wolves.""  One tries to take the film on its own terms, but the similarities are too glaring.  Logan wanted the film to be a classic, but it falls far short.That's not to say the film does not have its merits, which why ""The Last Samurai"" is so frustrating to watch.  When it does get good, it's breathtaking.  The $120 million production is a visual feast, with beautiful sets juxtaposed seamlessly with sweeping locales in Japan and New Zealand.  The film's visual pedigree is furthured by the wondrous cinematography of John Toll.  Toll, a two-time academy award winner, is a master at what he does.  The film is gorgeously shot and the hectically edited battle scenes are given a sense of clarity and extra punch, especially when set to Hans Zimmers' muscular score.

Tom Cruise delivers his most convincing role to date and this is one of the few parts I actually liked him in (thats saying a lot!). Of course, as mentioned in numerous reviews, Ken Watanabe steals the show as the Samurai leader and should have been awarded the Oscar over Tim Robbins. The action scenes are brutal and hold your interest, (SPOILERS!!!) but I didn't like the fact that Cruise was the only character to survive the final battle.

I am a huge samurai film fan, I don't like the super crazy ones, but am more of a kurasowa guy.But the biggest problem with this movie is AT LEAST 75% of the movie running time, it is showing tom cruise and then it cuts away to the next scene and theres tom cruise, then they hsho you a different angle of the shot, oh that's cool, now I have a better angle of tom cruise.  It was sickening.  It's not like he failed in this role, but they certainly should have focused on smoething else.  Another big problem for me was the emporer.  I think they found the person they liked as far as looks go, but this kid has no acting ability whatsoever.

808287,A1SCD2NYTIAQTY,B0001JXOUS,Mouldy Pilgrim,"[3, 4]","""The Last Samurai"", as mentioned by another reviewer above, has a lot of parallels in movies such as ""Dances With Wolves"". The whole wash-up, has-been hero finds a new sense of self and identity with people once perceived as ""barbarian"" or ""savage"". The theme has been done before and probably will be again.In ""The Last Samurai"", Capt. Algren is sent to Japan during the tale end of the Meiji Restoration to train the new Imperial Army in modern warfare. Despite the excellent pay, Algren is an alcoholic with some serious personality issues to boot. The new Imperial Army is soon sent into battle with the other problem: a rebel force of samurai led by Katsumoto, (Ken Watanabe). The results are predictably disastrous and Algren is captured alive. The rest of the plot follows a predictable pattern that most will be familiar with.The character of Katsumoto is actually based, albeit very loosely, on a real person whol live during a similar time and fought in Kyushu. The real man was one Saigo Takamori, who also committed seppuku according to legend. He actually died from bullet wounds sustained during his last stand near Kagoshima. A good book about the man isThe Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori, which is also an excellent read.Tom Cruise puts in an excellent performance, I have to say, as the dysfunctional Algren. Ken Watanabe is amazing in his protrayal of the samurai rebel leader, Katsumoto, bringing an intensity and depth to the movie that can be lacking in other characters.There are some small issues of error, such as ferns and so on in the forests. Being shot in New Zealand, the movie has some scenery from that country that is visibly not Japanese. However, these points are very small and do not take away from the spectacle of the film and its location.The battle scenes are truly amazing, and well shot. There is enough action and some comic relief to keep everyone pretty well entertained. The cultural differences between Algren and his Japanese hosts are a source of some amusement, especially as the younger samurai take a liking to him. This is despite the regular beatings he receives from older samurai he tries to take on.Despite the predictability of the movie, and the lack of originality in some regards, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked the style, the action, and the plot, and came away feeling thoroughly entertained and somewhat moved. I just simply liked the movie as overall, well-presented package.",4,Predictably Re-Hashed Theme,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,2464,"['Last', 'Samurai', 'mentioned', 'reviewer', 'lot', 'parallels', 'movies', 'such', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'whole', 'wash-up', 'has-been', 'hero', 'new', 'sense', 'self', 'identity', 'people', 'once', 'perceived', 'barbarian', 'savage', 'theme', 'been', 'done', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'again.In', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'Capt', 'Algren', 'sent', 'Japan', 'tale', 'end', 'Meiji', 'Restoration', 'train', 'new', 'Imperial', 'Army', 'modern', 'warfare', 'excellent', 'pay', 'Algren', 'alcoholic', 'serious', 'personality', 'issues', 'boot', 'new', 'Imperial', 'Army', 'soon', 'sent', 'battle', 'other', 'problem', 'rebel', 'force', 'samurai', 'led', 'Katsumoto', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'results', 'are', 'predictably', 'disastrous', 'Algren', 'captured', 'alive', 'rest', 'plot', 'predictable', 'pattern', 'most', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'with.The', 'character', 'Katsumoto', 'actually', 'based', 'albeit', 'very', 'loosely', 'real', 'person', 'whol', 'live', 'similar', 'time', 'fought', 'Kyushu', 'real', 'man', 'was', 'one', 'Saigo', 'Takamori', 'who', 'also', 'committed', 'seppuku', 'according', 'legend', 'actually', 'died', 'bullet', 'wounds', 'sustained', 'last', 'stand', 'Kagoshima', 'good', 'book', 'man', 'isThe', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'Life', 'Battles', 'Saigo', 'Takamori', 'also', 'excellent', 'read.Tom', 'Cruise', 'excellent', 'performance', 'have', 'say', 'dysfunctional', 'Algren', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'amazing', 'protrayal', 'samurai', 'rebel', 'leader', 'Katsumoto', 'bringing', 'intensity', 'depth', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'lacking', 'other', 'are', 'small', 'issues', 'error', 'such', 'ferns', 'so', 'forests', 'Being', 'shot', 'New', 'Zealand', 'movie', 'scenery', 'country', 'visibly', 'not', 'Japanese', 'However', 'points', 'are', 'very', 'small', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'spectacle', 'film', 'location.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'truly', 'amazing', 'well', 'shot', 'enough', 'action', 'comic', 'relief', 'keep', 'everyone', 'pretty', 'well', 'entertained', 'cultural', 'differences', 'Algren', 'Japanese', 'hosts', 'are', 'source', 'amusement', 'especially', 'younger', 'samurai', 'take', 'liking', 'regular', 'beatings', 'older', 'samurai', 'take', 'on.Despite', 'predictability', 'movie', 'lack', 'originality', 'regards', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'liked', 'style', 'action', 'plot', 'came', 'away', 'feeling', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'somewhat', 'moved', 'just', 'simply', 'liked', 'movie', 'overall', 'well-presented', 'package']",N/A

I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but he has impressed me in some of his films. 'The Last Samurai' just so happens to be one of those films! Cruise is excellent here and handles the lead role both physically and emotionally. Not since standing toe to toe with Dustin Hoffman in 'Rain Man' have I believed in one of his performances so whole heartedly.The film will certainly remind viewers of Costner's 'Dances with Wolvies' as it deals with a similar premise of a Civil War soldier's study of a foreign culture and total turn around of his preconceived opinion of it. I do think that 'Dances with Wolves' edges this one out, but it is a wonderful film all the same.The film is also beautiful to look with gorgeous scenery and breathtaking battles. The battle scenes are brutal, but never did I feel the graphic violence was gratuitous. There are a few tiny instances where I smelled Hollywood, but they are so tiny, I can't take away from this impressive film about honor and loyalty. It's just a beautiful film!

808292,AGOEKVIJV9UX6,B0001JXOUS,Mr. Markster,"[4, 4]","Last Samurai is one of my all time favorite movies. It's often compared with ""Dances With Wolves"" set in Japan, and indeed the plots are somewhat similar: Damaged American soldier livea among natives / foreingers, learns to embrace their way of life and stands up for their survival in battle. But that's where the similarities end. Of the two movies (both regarded as classics) I personally think Last Samurai is the vastly superior film.While it has been billed as an ""action"" film or a ""historical drama"" (both which accurately help describe the movie), The Last Samurai is first and foremost an Epic romance. Not to be mistaken as a romantic love story, the Epic romance is much larger in scope- a simple tale that beneath the surface is actually incredibly ""deep.""First and foremost, the movie is a romance of lofty ""epic"" ideals: change vs. tradition, friendship, honor, self discovery and self forgiveness, fighting for what you believe in, redemption.Detractors often argue the movie portrays capitalists and men of progress (such as Colonel Bagley and Omura) as villians who have no redeeming qualities. That is innacurate: YES, some characters who represent modernizaton are portayed as greedy and self serving (such as Omura); however, other modernists aren't villianized at all- General Hasegawa, the former samurai now fighting FOR the advancement of Japan, is certainly no villian- yet he is definitely modernist. The young nameless recruit who orders the machine guns to be fired at the end of the film is also not villianous. Even Tony Goldwin's Colonel Bagley isn't a greedy bastard like Omura- he truly believes that bringing American power to the less civilized nations of the world is the right thing to do. Today we might call such a person ignorant or prejudice, but back in the late 1800's when American globalization was still in its infancy, it was common for people to think the way Colonel Bagley did.Omura may portray the bad guy, but the true villian in The Last Samurai is fear. Fear of stepping into the unknown- accepting and embracing the necessity of progress at the expense and abondonment of traditions held sacred and true; the fear in the millions of voiceless individuals who struggle and fall through the cracks of increasingly changing times; the fear of the individual man who has fallen so far from grace that he believes he is damned, beyond redemption and unable to find salvation; the fear of becoming obsolete and un-neccesary; the fear of looking into a mirror and facing the reflection that stares back at you.The true hero in the Last Samurai is the antithesis of fear, the romanticized ideals of hope, friendship, honor, self discovery- all which can only be obtained through complete self forgiveness and inner redemption.The character of Nathan Algren (portrayed by Tom Cruise)has participated in an act of genocide against a tribe of native Americans that has left him a ruined aloholic shell of a man. Meanwhile, Katsumoto (Ken Wantanabe)finds himself and everything he stands for in jeopardy of becoming obsolete as his homeland swiftly moves from away from the traditional feudal society he to a new and modern one. At its core, the Last Samuari it is about the spiritual changes that come over two men who fight to preserve the ""old ways"" (which they see as a culture of discipline, respect, beauty, and communal solidarity in jeopardy of being overrun by ravenous forces of corruption and greed).The acting is amazing, the cinematography breathtaking, and the musical score beautiful. The movie is filled with individual scenes of incredible power that rank among the greatest ever put on film: for example, the scene where Taka dresses Algren for battle is an example of cinematic PERFECTION- not a word spoken, yet so much emotion conveyed. Or the ambiguity of Algren's fate at the very end of the movie , and whether or not the final scene of him returning to the village was real or just a figment of Simon Graham's (the narrator) imagination. The last line of the film (narrated) is one of my favorites of the entire film with Simon Graham philosophically concluding that Algren may have at last found a small measure of peace ""that we all seek, and few of us ever find.""Like any movie, The Last Samurai is going to have its detractors, particularly with the last 5-10 minutes or so. It definitely isn't a perfect film, but for some(like myself)it's an immensely powerful film and its spiritual depth and beauty far outweigh its flaws. It's one of the few films that I can watch any time.

808295,A3HA0A92FVYHOF,B0001JXOUS,"Mr. Tickle Snort ""Mr. Ticklesnort""","[9, 19]","(...) Haters of Western Culture have no fear:  The Last Samarai is here!  In The Last Samurai,  the Westerners (Americans and Brits) are once again the bad guys, infecting yet another innocent race with Western ways.The silmplistic plot involves American military officers going to Japan to help modernize the imperial military.  The time of the movie is the late 1870's when Japan was taking to western culture with a vengeance.  Tom Cruise and his men are hired to train the Japanese military to drive out the last exhisting Samarai warriors who are resistant to the new order.All is going not-so-well, when Tom Cruise ends up captured by the Samarai enemy.  He then falls in love with their culture and their ways.  Cruise then switches sides, eventually leading the Samarai in a final, suicidal assault on the newly equipped Japanese military.Throughout the flim, the plight of the Samarai is contrasted with that of The Native Americans in  the United States.  Both cultures have been threatened by the destructive effects of modernization (aka the white man's ways).Such parallels are ridiculous.  The idea of  Americans exploiting the ""nobel savage"" is a Western concept';  such ideas of ""good versus evil""  have never held sway in Japan.  Moreover,  in real life the last of the Samarai simply resigned, and the prestige of the Samarai order gradually decreased over time.  It was not wiped out by a Westernized military machine.Therein lies the film's irony;  by trying to flatter Japanese culture and history, The Last Samarai insults it.  One example of this is the depiction of Emperor Meji.  He is  depicted as an indecisive, weak- kneed boy who allows himself to be mocked by subordinates.  This is grossly innacurate and just plain shameless.

I had seen the reviews with mixed feelings, fearful that Cruise's ""Top Gun"" arrogance would crash through the culture like a Hummer.As it turned out, the Japanese cast led by Ken Watanbe keeps Cruise under control.  It was a little troubling to see Cruise's character completely master Katana technique and Iai waza in a single season, but I guess he had to to keep the plot moving.  Also, Cruise is a bit like Milton Berle - he has to be the last man off of every scene.  But Watanabe steals the movie and the supporting cast is terrific.  For once, Cruise doesn't seduce the woman who is forced to keep him in her house, and she complains that he smells bad.In the end, the movie is a spectacular paen to Bushido culture. (I haven't yet asked an old friend of mine who survived Bataan what he thought of this movie).  The movie tackles a tricky and contradictory period of Japanese history, the great inner conflict between modernists (who won) and the feudalists, who probably were not all noble.

When Algren is captured, he learns and eventually adopts the way of the samurai; culminating in a would be epic battle that ends with a whimper.

808306,A20ZFWGBY4REFX,B0001JXOUS,"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan""","[7, 10]","""The Last Samurai"" is, without a doubt, one of the finest action epics thatI have seen ever since ""Braveheart""! ""The Last Samurai"" is one of those rare films that combine a sweeping, heroic epic with an intimate, extremely poignant personal story of love, honor, and tenderness. The direction of Edward Zwick (""Glory"", ""Courage Under Fire"") was top-notch and powerful! And the performance of superstar Tom Cruise (""Minority Report"") was unforgettable! Surely one of the best Tom Cruise performances since ""Top Gun""!The film focuses on Nathan Algren (Cruise), a decorated war hero (from the war against the American Indians) now drunkenly relegated to showing off new gun technology at expositions. Algren is offered handsome compensation to leave the States and help bring Japan into the modern age of guns and to suppress a revolt of nontechnological samurai making trouble in the hinterlands. During a raid that is botched by unready troops, Algren is captured but not before managing to cleverly kill off one of the most accomplished samurai. The samurai lord, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), is impressed with Algren's magificent fighting spirit and resourcefulness and decides to nurse him back to health so that he might learn more about his enemy.The premise revealed. I will skip the rest of the plot, saying only that it is inevitable that Algren comes to respect and then love the ways of his captors and becomes himself an accomplished warrior in their disciplined traditions. He soon allies himself against his former compatriots and must learn what true honor is and how both life and death can help one reach his destiny. Essentially, and I do not say this casually, this film is ""Dances with Wolves"" set among the Japanese ""other"" rather than the American ""other"".The film started like a Tom Cruise movie, stopped being one for a fascinating hour or so, and then returned to its Hollywood roots. When we first see Cruise, he is doing his trademark Cruise acting: slightly over the top in his anger, drunkenness, and overall swagger. However, once Algren is abducted, we get to see some really nice stuff. Thank goodness for the strength and charisma of his co-star, Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto. Watanabe is as focused and economical an actor I have seen in some time and manages to communicate more rage, love, or concern in a steely glance than Cruise can with a monologue's worth of bluster.It's great watching Algren and Katsumoto (and incidentally, Cruise and Watanabe) learn from each other and settle each other down. Cruise is at his best here when he's 'listening', when someone else is driving the scene. I dare say even that he's better when speaking his scant lines of Japanese than those in English because it forces him most convinvingly out of his element. However, just as we come to admire Cruise's identification with samurai stillness and restraint (and what one can achieve with a ""good death""), the spirit of the movie swings back across the Pacific to Hollywood again, and we have a fairly typical Cruise ending that betrays what we have come to appreciate most about ""The Last Samurai"" -- the acceptance of destiny. I won't spoil the end, but I will say that whether or not Algren survives the climactic battle (between sword-wielding samurai and newfangled howitzer repeating rifles) makes or breaks the point of Algren's spiritual conversion.""The Last Samurai"" is beautifully filmed, and like two of director Ed Zwick's own definitive films -- ""Courage Under Fire"" and ""Glory"" -- this one asks challenging questions about honor and country from the perspective of outsiders. In conclusion, ""The Last Samurai"" not only has two unforgettable performances by Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe, but also a fine supporting cast including Timothy Spall, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Koyuki, and William Atherton.

During the early years of the American political and cultural incursion into Japan, Algren is hired essentially as a mercenary to train the Imperial Japanese Army in the ways of modern warfare.  Before he has had a chance to do his job properly, he is called upon to lead a well-equipped but poorly trained force against a ""rebel"" army led by the samurai lord Katsumoto (played by Ken Watanabe).  During the initial engagement, Algren's force is routed by the samurai and Algren himself is taken prisoner by Katsumoto for the purpose of ""understanding my enemy.""Thus begins the gradual transformation of Algren from a highly stereotyped American chauvinist to a member of Katsumoto's community.  The early reception is cold and unaccepting, both by Katsumoto's family and his fellow samurai, but over time a grudging tolerance gives way to cautious familiarity and ultimately to full acceptance and respect.  As I observed this process, I could not help being reminded of ""Dances With Wolves"", in which Kevin Costner's character undergoes a similar rebirth.  This notion was fueled even more by the romantic energy between Algren and the widow of a samurai whom he had killed during his capture.Algren eventually rises to enjoy great respect and admiration among Katsumoto's people, becoming in effect the samurai lord's right-hand man and deputy commander.  He helps lead Katsumoto's forces in several battles against the Japanese army, including the climactic final engagement where his honor is put to the ultimate test (but I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't seen it yet).Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable and moving tale of the clash of cultures, somewhat loose in its historicity, with a strong emphasis on concepts like valor, honor and independence.  The story line was slightly cliche and more than a little romanticized, but hey, that's Hollywood.

This is your typical Hollywood revised history where actual dramatic events are diluted with your conventional PC script and mandatory vapid love story.  Although the film has a decent cast with good direction and cinemtography, it's bogged down by a generic Hollywood screenplay and poor script.Retired Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is fed up with the US Army and the Indian Wars.  Approached by a fellow veteran and nemesis (Tony Goldwyn), Algren accepts a lucrative offer to train the Emperor of Japan's forces along the modern standards of 1875.  Arriving in Japan, Algren's informed that the Emperor's traditional samurai warriors and their leader (Ken Watanabe) oppose all attempts to modernize Japan.  Believing that firearms are cowardly weapons, the samurai hold true to their Bushido code and continue to fight with their traditional weapons.  Disillusioned with his shame of the Indian wars he fought back home and eager to redeem his honor, Algren becomes enamoured with the ethos of Samurai warriors and so decides to join them for a final stand.This was a good story that just never seemed to soar.  This is mostly due to a generic and predictable formulaic Hollywood script with cliche dialogue.  Does every drama have to conclude with an out-of-place happy romantic sub-plot to the likes of a 90210 episode?  Although a film about samurai warriors, the film only pays lip service to the teachings of the Bushido code with quick scenes of warriors committing hara-kiri and hardened Japanese men sitting stoically on their knees drinking sake. The dialogue is contrived and superficial: exploring only the surface of the Bushido code and Japanese culture.In conclusion, the film is decent but comes far short of the epic it could have been.  Here, a great story was hampered by the inclusion of conventional modern plots that are at odds with the historical drama covered by the film.  The acting was decent but not terribly memorable due to a rather contrived script.

808328,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B0001JXOUS,Ping Lim,"[4, 6]","I strongly urge the viewers to watch the second disc after viewing the movie itself.  The presentation of the disc is superb and for a movie enthusiast like myself, I appreciate knowing the thoughts of Director, the cast, the process, the location, the designs of costumes and the set, and so forth.  This disc collection has got them all.  It's wonderful to note that some of Japanese actors and actresses in the movie played a significant role by assisting the Director, Zwick in understanding the protocols and behaviours of the past when Samurais roamed Japan.  There's a tremendous respect between the Japanese and the production crew as they assisted one another in bridging the cultural gap &amp; enhancing one another's performances.  I am disappointed to read about people's comparison of this movie with Dances With Wolves.  If people's tendency is to compare this movie with that and so forth, movie industry would have come to a close long time ago as why should people cough out money to watch a movie that is almost identical to the movie that they watched before?  I have enormous respect for Tom Cruise as he's a focused and dedicated actor.  Moreover, he's almost universally known as a generous actor too.  Whilst Tom was shooting in New Zealand location, he had interacted with the local community by calling a local radio station &amp; donating resources to charity.  That's what I call star quality.  Anyhow, this movie is very well-done as the production crew took the best element from their location shots particularly in those old shrines in Himeji &amp; Kyoto, Japan; New Zealand.  Japanese cast is superb namely Ken Watanabe who lost out on Oscar's Best Supporting Actor Award.  He definitely lifted this movie to another level by giving it a much needed weight, presence, &amp; charisma and no wonder his samurais followed him to the shadow of death as long as honour is restored.  The documentary about samurais in the second disc is very informative.  It wanted the viewers to decide for themselves if this movie is pure Hollywood or historical fact.  At the end of the day, it's a bit of both.  The anchor said it well that in real life, the samurais would be considered the renegade, the dinasours that refused to give in to the fact that their time had passed and that they refused to move on with time.  They were supposed to be the &quot;baddies&quot; in the movie as they fought against the Government which would like to implement change for the betterment of Japanese society.  Moreover, what about the caste system that they implemented in their own village?  As I was in Japan, I always wondered if the change that the Government enforced is necessarily better for its society?  I also wondered how practical it would be should samurais are still roaming Japan and every time they step into the railway station, all people would kneel down and avoiding eye contact and they would cut the innocents if they get in their ways somehow?  In some ways, I miss Japan of the old as any industrial cities nowadays look almost similar to each other.  Still, we have to come to terms that time changes everything.  Anyhow, a very well-made and touching movie that shouldn't be missed.

The colors are much more vibrant, the clarity is remarkable and it serves to submerse you in a movie that was already great as it was.

Mccaffrey ""PM-24-7""","[0, 1]","I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but, thought that this movie was great.The story of sacrifice seemed a lot more compelling to me in this movie than in Braveheart (who doesn't like Braveheart). Braveheart was a numbers war and it seemed like maybe the Scots/Irish had a chance, whereas, the traditional Japanese Samurai never had a chance against firearms...It was just extremely moving to see these legendary/respected warriors simply mowed down...in a way that was completely honorless. They were fighting for the good of the country/unity/tradition not just the vague concept of ""freedom"" (Braveheart). I also really enjoyed being familiarized with the history and tradition of the Samurai (from other reviewers, I understand that the accounts are fairly accurate).I appreciated the authenticity of the characters and how the movie stayed true to the Japanese culture. The negative reviews that I've read are obviously from people who can't appreciate differences in culture. Examples of this authenticity include: 1) No nudity in this movie...traditional Japanese culture was/is extremely reserved (especially women) and throwing in gratuitous nudity would have totally destroyed the feel of the movie. 2) Honor- the movie did a great job of utilizing Cruise to familiarize the movie goer with traditions that we might not have understood by introducing the values of this society through the eyes/values of someone the movie-goer could relate to (Cruise). 3) There have been several critics of the movie who found it preposterous that Cruise would stay with the widow of the man that he killed...I wasn't sure about this either...It seemed like if he posed any sort of threat, Watanabe's character shouldn't have put an enemy soldier in with his sister and some kids...If he didn't understand Cruise's culture, why would he have taken the chance...The treatment of Cruise, however, did fit the treatment that a guest would receive in the Japanese culture at that time regardless of what the host felt about the guest...The visuals in this movie were excellant. Other movie review sites that break down and grade the different aspects of this movie have reviewers who have given this movie F's across the board...I think these people are idiots. Even if you thought that this movie was horrible, there's no way that the cinematography deserved an ""F."" The visuals were probably the highlight of this film (esp. the sunset scene, flower gardens, and village scenes).Complaints: Tom Cruise's last line doesn't do the movie justice (it made me cringe)...The movie seemed to delve into something unique up until the Hollywood line that was thrown in at the end of the movie...(""I won't tell you how he died, I will tell you how he lived""). The movie had me hooked up until I heard this spouted from Cruise's mouth...I think that this was one of the few things that I disliked about the movie...The weakling emperor also really irritated me...I recognize that this teenager was probably an accurate depiction of the leaders of the empire, however, it was still irritating to see someone so weak/cowardly elevated above characters that were so much more respectable.Go see this movie!",4,Movie Review: Praise and Complaints (from 3x viewer),1075420800,"01 30, 2004",2004,3183,"['am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'great.The', 'story', 'sacrifice', 'seemed', 'lot', 'more', 'compelling', 'movie', 'Braveheart', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'Braveheart', 'Braveheart', 'was', 'numbers', 'war', 'seemed', 'maybe', 'Scots/Irish', 'had', 'chance', 'whereas', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'Samurai', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'firearms', 'was', 'just', 'extremely', 'moving', 'see', 'legendary/respected', 'warriors', 'simply', 'mowed', 'down', 'way', 'was', 'completely', 'honorless', 'were', 'fighting', 'good', 'country/unity/tradition', 'not', 'just', 'vague', 'concept', 'freedom', 'Braveheart', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'familiarized', 'history', 'tradition', 'Samurai', 'other', 'reviewers', 'understand', 'accounts', 'are', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'appreciated', 'authenticity', 'characters', 'how', 'movie', 'stayed', 'true', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'negative', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'are', 'obviously', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'differences', 'culture', 'Examples', 'authenticity', 'include', '1', 'nudity', 'movie', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'extremely', 'reserved', 'especially', 'women', 'throwing', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'would', 'have', 'totally', 'destroyed', 'feel', 'movie', '2', 'Honor-', 'movie', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'utilizing', 'Cruise', 'familiarize', 'movie', 'goer', 'traditions', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'understood', 'introducing', 'values', 'society', 'eyes/values', 'someone', 'movie-goer', 'could', 'relate', 'Cruise', '3', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'critics', 'movie', 'who', 'found', 'preposterous', 'Cruise', 'would', 'stay', 'widow', 'man', 'killed', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'either', 'seemed', 'posed', 'sort', 'threat', 'Watanabe', 'character', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'enemy', 'soldier', 'sister', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Cruise', 'culture', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'chance', 'treatment', 'Cruise', 'however', 'did', 'fit', 'treatment', 'guest', 'would', 'receive', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'time', 'regardless', 'what', 'host', 'felt', 'guest', 'visuals', 'movie', 'were', 'excellant', 'Other', 'movie', 'review', 'break', 'down', 'grade', 'different', 'aspects', 'movie', 'have', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'F', 'board', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'idiots', 'Even', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'horrible', 'way', 'cinematography', 'deserved', 'F.', 'visuals', 'were', 'probably', 'highlight', 'film', 'esp', 'sunset', 'scene', 'flower', 'gardens', 'village', 'scenes', '.Complaints', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'last', 'line', ""n't"", 'do', 'movie', 'justice', 'made', 'cringe', 'movie', 'seemed', 'delve', 'something', 'unique', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'line', 'was', 'thrown', 'end', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'died', 'will', 'tell', 'how', 'lived', 'movie', 'had', 'hooked', 'up', 'heard', 'spouted', 'Cruise', 'mouth', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'disliked', 'movie', 'weakling', 'emperor', 'also', 'really', 'irritated', 'recognize', 'teenager', 'was', 'probably', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'leaders', 'empire', 'however', 'was', 'still', 'irritating', 'see', 'someone', 'so', 'weak/cowardly', 'elevated', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'respectable.Go', 'see', 'movie']",N/A

808332,A1S5QBRR6X1UZ0,B0001JXOUS,"""predestined88""","[3, 3]","Okay! Okay! It's not Kurosawa! It's not some fantastic hard to locate Samurai classic! It's not worth taking your hand out of your laps and getting out of your mom's basement long enough to go and purchase it!!! However, Mr. or Mrs. Purist, it certainly serves as a decent introduction into the Samurai film genre!!! Before I go any further, here's the lowdown:Story- It really is ""Dances with Wolves"" with Samurai! Admittedly, it also reeked (in essence) of Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot""!! Shogun lite??!! Nevertheless, it still was a good film despite a lack of originality and the usual ""clich&eacute;'s"" of honor, loyalty, integrity and love. Noticed that I said that it was a GOOD film Mr. and Mrs. Purists, not a great one!!! Its good family fare and I hope will provoke interest in some of the other Samurai films (which usually are poor family fare). In all fairness, it should be stated that the purists are right in the fact that it's not exactly historically accurate and a little more research and a better script would have helped out a lot!One issue I would like to address is this racist notion that a ""white guy"" running around playing Samurai is a ""bad"" thing. Admittedly, it's not exactly historically kosher but it isn't necessarily a horrible thing. Nevertheless, playing pin the label on the ""white guy"" isn't exactly kosher either!Action- The action sequences are tightly and neatly done. The Samurai fan in me wanted more!!!  I would point out that I did think it a little over the top for Tom Cruise's character to become such a astoundingly formidable Samurai in such a short period of time! It did kind of remind me of the old Tom &amp; Jerry cartoon skits where Tom learns how to ""Play the piano in three easy lessons!"" and just after hitting three keys he then rips into Chopin!!! Despite this, the fights were still entertaining, just far and few between! Parents should be warned that there is some blood involved but not on the level of ""Barveheart"".Acting- This is where the good and the bad comes in. The good was the attractive performance Wantanabe gives. He appears to be enjoying the role and that is always infectious! Hey, Hollywood! Here's the guy for an updated version of ""Shogun""! Then, there is Tom. Tom! Tom! Tom! It's not that he's bad in this, he really is not. However, he really didn't fit the role. Most folks won't care and that's not a bad thing but Tom is certainly not Samurai! I couldn't say who would be but I know for certain that it isn't him! The problem really lies at the feet of his celebrity. He's just too well known. Every time he stepped into a scene, his being TOM CRUISE detracted from the moment and his decent performance. I would have to say that a more gruffly someone (the beard didn't sell Tom!) of less renown or an up and comer would have benefited the role a little better. This would have also placed more visual emphasis on a scene as a whole and prevented any celebrity distraction. Yes, Tom! You CAN be too popular for a film's good!!!! Nice try though!The other actors gave us fine to solid performances but I'm sure that plenty of other Samurai lovin' ""Amazonians"" will try and learn us different.DVD Quality- Issssss goooood!!! Why on earth anyone would want the full-screen version of such a film is totally beyond me??!!!! Death to full screen!!! Trust me; it's for your own good!!Extras- The extras are fairly generous. I know that there will be those who will have demanded more but what more could they really want? I never quite understood the desire in demanding that every film have 4-6 hours of extras. I guess these folks have too much time on their hand (I know what I said)!! I would like to point out that the Hollywood vs. History was a slight let down. Instead of expert analysis, we got a fairly informative and slightly inaccurate historical overview on Samurai history. It would have been nicer to see a discussion between a panel of dusty old scholars rather than the movie promo we get. The rest of the extras are informative if a little on the short side.In closing, Last Samurai is good but not a masterpiece but then it's not the master-piece of ca-ca as the purists would have you thinking. It not without it's faults but only after one devours a few of the films listed below will one begin to see what those faults are.Next!!- Now then, where to go from here. Obviously, there are plenty of fine Samurai films to watch but not all of them are easy to come by. Here is small but decent list:Older- Difficult to find comes with a *Seven SamuraiYojimboSanjuroSamurai 1, 2 and 3Chushingura*Zatoichi (The Japanese T.V. series)Shogun Assassin*Sword of Doom*Tenchu*47 Ronin*Kill!

(The Last Samurai is also a reiteration of Harrison Ford's Witness, minus the charm.)  Invincible American white man goes to Asian country, learns their tradition to perfection in a mere two seasons, and becomes one of their leaders to lead them into war, and survives the battlefield while every Japanese samurai gets annihilated, ending in a scene where EVERY Japanese soldier kneels and bows to the great white god on the battlefield.  When you tell a story where the protagonist has ALL the good cards all the time, it makes you question whether the movie has a message, or is just another advancing notch in  cultural imperialism, creating a storyline where natural selection enables the superior party to continue into the next  generation.  I know entertainment should be treated as entertainment and not historical fact or social theory, but when you have highly questionable circumstances, then it throws the other, more important aspects of the movie into question.Now I understand that this movie is literally a rice queen's dream come true.  I mean, there are very few places in this world where you can kill a man, say ""I'm sorry"" to the hot widow, and end up hopping in the sack with her.  All this while the dead man's surviving children adore and dote over you, the man who killed their father.  Once we question the realism of a man being able to master a form of martial arts in a few months, we begin to question the success rate of whether we, can indeed go around killing men if we want to sleep with their wives.  And if we can't buy into THAT fantasy, well then what the heck is the point of watching the movie!?The photography was good and the acting wasn't bad.  At one point I wished dearly that the sentimental soundtrack would halt.  War is a horrific act of mankind.  I think this movie went to lengths to capture the reality and horror of war combined with man against machine, and it came stunningly close.  In independent foreign films, war scenes have often been depicted without any lush orchestration.  I think that, is a responsible decision.  I could not help envisioning the battlefield climax without the soundtrack.  Just the hard reality of men's groans, horses neighing, and screams of terror in the stark afternoon air would deliver the message tenfold.  I felt insulted that music needed to be enlisted to ""help"" me feel that way about something so horrific.Koyuki plays Taka, the widow, who is curiously mute throughout the movie.  It's the stereotypical form of submissiveness that the West is comfortable with when it comes to Asian women.  Cruise's lack of facial expressiveness is hidden by facial hair, so that helped.All in all, I thought it had great potential.  I gave it an extra star because it came close to capturing how horrific war is, especially when one side is over-armed, and the other has, only honor.",2,"I know the Japanese are accomodating, but this is ridiculous!",1208563200,"04 19, 2008",2008,2990,"['took', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'storyline', 'really', 'nothing', 'Steven', 'Seagal/', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'movie', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'also', 'reiteration', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Witness', 'minus', 'charm', 'Invincible', 'American', 'white', 'man', 'Asian', 'country', 'tradition', 'perfection', 'mere', 'two', 'seasons', 'one', 'leaders', 'lead', 'war', 'battlefield', 'Japanese', 'samurai', 'annihilated', 'ending', 'scene', 'where', 'EVERY', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'kneels', 'bows', 'great', 'white', 'god', 'battlefield', 'When', 'tell', 'story', 'where', 'protagonist', 'good', 'cards', 'time', 'question', 'movie', 'message', 'just', 'advancing', 'notch', 'cultural', 'imperialism', 'creating', 'storyline', 'where', 'natural', 'selection', 'superior', 'party', 'continue', 'next', 'generation', 'know', 'entertainment', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'entertainment', 'not', 'historical', 'fact', 'social', 'theory', 'when', 'have', 'highly', 'questionable', 'circumstances', 'then', 'other', 'more', 'important', 'aspects', 'movie', 'question.Now', 'understand', 'movie', 'literally', 'rice', 'queen', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'mean', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'places', 'world', 'where', 'can', 'kill', 'man', 'say', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'hot', 'widow', 'end', 'up', 'hopping', 'sack', 'dead', 'man', 'surviving', 'children', 'adore', 'dote', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'father', 'question', 'realism', 'man', 'being', 'able', 'master', 'form', 'martial', 'arts', 'few', 'months', 'begin', 'question', 'success', 'rate', 'can', 'indeed', 'go', 'around', 'killing', 'men', 'want', 'sleep', 'wives', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'fantasy', 'well', 'then', 'what', 'heck', 'point', 'watching', 'movie', 'photography', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'one', 'point', 'wished', 'dearly', 'sentimental', 'soundtrack', 'would', 'halt', 'War', 'horrific', 'act', 'mankind', 'think', 'movie', 'went', 'lengths', 'capture', 'reality', 'horror', 'war', 'combined', 'man', 'machine', 'came', 'stunningly', 'close', 'independent', 'foreign', 'films', 'war', 'scenes', 'have', 'often', 'been', 'depicted', 'lush', 'orchestration', 'think', 'responsible', 'decision', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'envisioning', 'battlefield', 'climax', 'soundtrack', 'Just', 'hard', 'reality', 'men', 'groans', 'horses', 'neighing', 'screams', 'terror', 'stark', 'afternoon', 'air', 'would', 'deliver', 'message', 'tenfold', 'felt', 'insulted', 'music', 'needed', 'be', 'enlisted', 'help', 'feel', 'way', 'something', 'so', 'horrific.Koyuki', 'plays', 'Taka', 'widow', 'who', 'curiously', 'mute', 'movie', 'stereotypical', 'form', 'submissiveness', 'West', 'comfortable', 'when', 'Asian', 'women', 'Cruise', 'lack', 'facial', 'expressiveness', 'hidden', 'facial', 'hair', 'helped.All', 'thought', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'gave', 'extra', 'star', 'came', 'close', 'capturing', 'how', 'horrific', 'war', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'side', 'over-armed', 'other', 'only', 'honor']",N/A

What place do these hold in life and all it encompasses.  Warner Bros. ""The Last Samurai"" attempts to depict the epic and time age tale of traditional norms versus a new and modernizing society.The story takes place in Japan.  However, not Japan as we know it today, but just as it was emerging from its bloody, feudal cradle.  A feudal bloodbath entailing Japanese ways of life no more than 150 years ago.""The Last Samurai"" begins with a Japanese empirical advisor who needs the samurai eliminated in order to finish his railroad.  At first the samurai are viewed as imperial rebeliests; ""barbarians"" with no sense of what is right and wrong.  The advisor hires an American Civil War veteran, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), and for $500 a month he trains a small army of men to fight the samurai.  But when the samurai attack a railroad construction village the advisor becomes impatient and orders Cruise's superior officer Colonel Benjamin Bagly (Tony Goldwyn) to lead the small and unprepared force against the samurai.  The skilled and experienced samurai easily overpower the unpolished army and take Cruise as their prisoner.  Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) the group leader of the samurai, along with other agendas, wishes to ""know his enemy.""Cruise eventually grows to love the simplicity and stillness of the samurai way of life.  He adopts the concept of Bushido (Japanese for ""way of the warrior""); a theme that flows compassionately throughout the film.  Over the course of a year he learns samurai ways, their fighting methods, and even eventually begins to learn their language. But when his new found life is threatened by the old, he chooses to fight with the men he once considered his enemy.Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a downtrodden Civil War veteran who douses his troubles in alcohol.  He suffers from flashbacks that give Cruise's character a sense of shame and weariness.  And while Cruise's performance is exceptional even he cannot take precedence over the grandeur and scope of what ""The Last Samurai"" does symbolize.  The death of an era, and the usherance of technological assimilation.Asian actors Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto), and Koyuki (Taka), play their roles brilliantly; and while their dialogue is not as numerous as Cruise's, their actions speak for more than themselves.  Katsumoto, is a proud, thoughtful, and an integrible samurai leader.  For more than 900 years he and his ancestors have protected the ways and honor of his people.  He and Cruise periodically converse in philosophical meetings sprinkled with humor.  Taka shines as Cruise's caretaker.  However, very early in the movie we find out that Taka is a widow of a samurai that Cruise has killed in battle; an enigma that lends a sense of depth and responsibility to both characters roles throughout the movie.Perhaps one of the more historical points is the weakness of the Japanese Emperor, Meiji, played by Scichinosuke Nakamura.  At this point of Japan's history, the Emperor became more of a figurehead, controlled by a group of economist advisors only wishing to fatten their wallets.  But this is portrayed in more of a symbolic matter throughout ""The Last Samurai.""Both the complexity and simplicity of ""The Last Samurai,"" enjoy ubiquity throughout the film.  There is never a moment in which both must not be weighed equally.  With every scene there is a sense of duty and honor, while there is at the same time enjoyment in the stillness of life.  A concoction of artsy filmography and articulating background music allow the plot to encompass all aspects of the movie; never will a moment take precedence over the plot or all that it strives to facilitate.  The facts of the matter are perhaps best but in a quote from the movie:Algren:  ""Life in every breath . . .""Katsumoto:  ""That is Bushido""All in all I would have to say ""The Last Samurai"" will be going on my all time favorite list.  Never have a watched a movie with such compassion and dedication towards one fervor.  Every fight scene is not without purpose, and a message.  And the action does not sway the viewer from the movie's ultimate and undeniable essence.Several comparisons by other film critics have compared the movie to ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" and ""Dances with Wolves,"" in which the westerner becomes infatuated and then eventually assimilated into the natural culture; I even noticed several parallels to ""Glory,"" which was also directed by Edward Zwick.  And while these aspects may have lended something to the movie, simply enjoy it for what it is; volumes could be written on the parallels to Akira Kurusawa's ""Seven Samurai."" No matter how many similarities there may be, there are just as many original concepts to be beheld.The only one complaint I have is the ""Hollywood"" ending.  Hauntingly familiar to ""Dances with Wolves,"" it was ending that did not seem befitting of such a cinematic masterpiece.  However, I would have to say that it is worthy of any notable DVD collection.After the movie was over and the credits began their usual scroll, I noticed that nearly half the people in the audience sat there while the other half stood and enjoyed the music.  I would like to think that they remained in deep contemplation and awe of all that this movie put into essence.

While the Ebert's and Roeper's are constantly invited to big premiere's and likely never lay out one single dime to view a movie, it is us; the paying customers, whose dimes make or break a film. That being said, I have put my foot in my mouth in the past when discussing certain actors. Up til now, I've always felt Tom Cruise to be overrated and nothing more than eye candy for starstruck females.As a mere movie fan, I feel as if every actor who achieves greatness has their definitive film that catches my attention and convinces me that they are more than I bargained for. Robert Deniro had &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. Ray Liotta had &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. Johnny Depp had &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;. Denzel Washington had &quot;Malcolm X&quot;. Now, after years of consistently maintaining that Tom Cruise had no more acting talent than a dead carp, &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; has fully inserted foot into my mouth.Actually, I should take a small step back. Within the past year, I have come to learn that Tom Cruise had personally help finance films that he saw that were running into trouble in the home stretch. When things began to look somewhat grim, Tom Cruise helped get &quot;Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels&quot; and &quot;Narc&quot; into American theaters and as a huge fan of both movies, I felt a need to tip my hat to Mr. Cruise for getting those movies attention that they may not otherwise had received. Like me, Tom Cruise was a fan on movies first and I respect that. However, I had yet to see his acting work turn me fully around. &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; changed that forever.In short, Tom Cruise plays a Civil War Captain who has nightmares of murdering innocent Native Americans in battle. These nightmares feed his obvious drinking problem. He is offered a job for 4 times his regular pay to sail to Japan and train an army to battle the remains of the ancient samurai. Despite their inability to perform, the new Japanese army marches into battle prematurely and amidst a stampede by the samurai, he is captured alive.During his captivity, he meets Katsumoto and through the winter months, he  slowly grows to understand their culture and their respect for life and death. All of this is climaxed in the final battle when he rides out in battle as a samurai with Katsumoto in what ends up being probably the greatest battle scene ever committed to film or at least on par with that of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy.The acting by the entire cast is superb. Tom Cruise's transformation from tragic figure to hardened warrior is nothing short of flawless. The respectful manner in which the samurai is portrayed takes you back into a period in history where you clearly witness a clash of civilizations. One of the finest ways that this is captured is the poetic and ballet-esque motion of the battle sequences. One can tell immediately that the director went to great lengths to avoid having this film be categorized as merely another &quot;samurai flick&quot;. It is instead a great, epic film about a culture that was driven into the annals of history and all but forgotten about.The total package includes a supplement disc containing a virtual well of special features that take you on a stunning detailed ride behind the camera with interviews, historical comparisons, costume and set designs and training for battle sequences.

While the particulars are not accurate and the main character is fictitious, the conflict between liberal and conservatives in japan during that time was real.

A dispirited decorated American civil war captain who has lost his moral roots in campaigns against Native Americans turns mercenary and accepts a military training post in Japan, a country on the verge of loosing its roots in trying to modernize to Western ways. The captain will help train the fledgling national army. This film pits the captain against a Samurai tribal warrior and leader who, by way of leading a rebellion against the government, is trying to guide in wisdom the young Emperor who himself is unsure of the best way to lead Japan into the future. The young Emperor, inexperienced, is torn between advisers who wish to crush the Samurai and their traditions and the Samurai tribal leader himself who at one time was his mentor. In battle, the American Captain is captured by the rebellion, but is not killed. Instead he is held captive thru the winter at the remote mountain village of the Samurai leader and his people. The captain is free to move thru and observe the village and thru much trial eventually learns to respect their ways. It is here where he rediscovers his roots. He and the tribal leader, who is well educated and actually speaks some English, become close friends learning from each other while coming to honor their mutual ways and values. The Captain eventually sides with the warrior  and is by his side when he dies in the field of his final battle against the national army. The Captain carries his message of honoring the values and traditions of the Samurai and their importance to the history and culture of the people to the young Emperor and it is in death where the rebellion achieves victory. The Emperor decides in his favor and rejects the ambitious policies of his advisers: he will not engage in treaties with the West that compromise the historical roots and traditions of his people. This is a wonderful film, well acted, with a well written script, filmed in a magnificent location (New Zealand i think).",5,Roots,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,1982,"['magnificent', 'film', 'dispirited', 'decorated', 'American', 'civil', 'war', 'captain', 'who', 'lost', 'moral', 'roots', 'campaigns', 'Native', 'Americans', 'mercenary', 'military', 'training', 'post', 'Japan', 'country', 'verge', 'loosing', 'roots', 'trying', 'modernize', 'Western', 'ways', 'captain', 'will', 'help', 'train', 'fledgling', 'national', 'army', 'film', 'captain', 'Samurai', 'tribal', 'warrior', 'leader', 'who', 'way', 'leading', 'rebellion', 'government', 'trying', 'guide', 'wisdom', 'young', 'Emperor', 'who', 'unsure', 'best', 'way', 'lead', 'Japan', 'future', 'young', 'Emperor', 'inexperienced', 'torn', 'advisers', 'who', 'wish', 'crush', 'Samurai', 'traditions', 'Samurai', 'tribal', 'leader', 'who', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'mentor', 'battle', 'American', 'Captain', 'captured', 'rebellion', 'not', 'killed', 'Instead', 'held', 'captive', 'thru', 'winter', 'remote', 'mountain', 'village', 'Samurai', 'leader', 'people', 'captain', 'free', 'move', 'thru', 'observe', 'village', 'thru', 'much', 'trial', 'eventually', 'respect', 'ways', 'here', 'where', 'roots', 'tribal', 'leader', 'who', 'well', 'educated', 'actually', 'speaks', 'English', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'learning', 'other', 'coming', 'honor', 'mutual', 'ways', 'values', 'Captain', 'eventually', 'sides', 'warrior', 'side', 'when', 'field', 'final', 'battle', 'national', 'army', 'Captain', 'message', 'honoring', 'values', 'traditions', 'Samurai', 'importance', 'history', 'culture', 'people', 'young', 'Emperor', 'death', 'where', 'rebellion', 'victory', 'Emperor', 'favor', 'ambitious', 'policies', 'advisers', 'will', 'not', 'engage', 'treaties', 'West', 'compromise', 'historical', 'roots', 'traditions', 'people', 'wonderful', 'film', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'filmed', 'magnificent', 'location', 'New', 'Zealand', 'i', 'think']",N/A

808341,A39WM5BQ54J8XY,B0001JXOUS,"Randy E. Aveille ""raveille""","[6, 6]","Just as the ocean has shallow ends and deep ends, The Last Samurai is a film whose story, in part, lies on the surface and also lies, in part, deeper beneath the surface. At face value, you will find a tale about an old world culture (the Samurai culture) clashing with a rising, powerful modern culture (Western culture). Although this is almost certainly an oversimplification of the story, the clash-of-cultures saga played out in this movie is basically the ""shallow end"" of the premise. In fact, the story and setting in and of themselves are merely a convenient backdrop for which to convey its actual message; which is much deeper and more interesting.Cruise plays 7th Cavalry Army Captain, Nathan Algren. He is a troubled and tormented man who is haunted by tremendous guilt, brought on by his experiences fighting and killing American Indians circa 1876. He is generally lauded as a hero around the US, ironically admired for the very actions that precipitate his self-loathing. He is not interested in fame or accolades; he is a man who desperately wants to escape his personal demons, but is completely helpless to suffer through them. Like many people who suffer from such inescapable torment, he turns to the bottle for his salvation. Still present are the post-traumatic nightmares and flashbacks of his war-fighting days. But alas, as he tries to drown his sorrows, they do indeed learn to swim. His acquired inclination toward the excessive consumption of libations notwithstanding, he does his best to cope, however unfruitful his efforts may be.Although he has been begrudgingly following orders to this point, he nevertheless has done his best to fulfill them dutifully. By turn of events, Algren encounters a Japanese General named Hasegawa who has a profitable offer for him. Despite his heavy drinking, Algren is eventually hired to train the Japanese army in Western warfare and to use firearms in battle against the fierce battle-experienced Samurai. Western culture is all the rage in Japan, and powerful political influences want to wipe out the old system that was influenced by the Samurai Code in order to foster a modern Japanese culture. Algren is sent to Japan and finds a group of soldiers who know nothing concerning the use of firearms. He earnestly tries to train them properly so as to prepare them for battle, but Japanese General Hasegawa is impatient with the troops' development; and much to Algren's dismay, Hasegawa orders them to begin fighting Samurai even though the troops are ill-prepared to do so.The first battle against the Samurai is disastrous for the secular Japanese troops, and a slaughter ensues at the hands of the defiant Samurai warriors. But Algren survives the battle and winds up being surrounded by several Samurai. Algren, ever the fearless warrior, stands his ground with a ferocious vigor, showing tremendous valor and honor in displaying that he will fight until his last breath. It is here that Samurai elder and leader, Katsumoto notices Algren's impressive will to fight to the death. Katsumoto, if only out of curiosity, spares Algren's life and keeps him as a ""free"" captive in his Samurai village until winter passes.During his stay, Algren is treated with dignity albeit an underlying distrust and resentment from the local villagers. Because of his heavy reliance on alcohol, Algren begins going through terrible symptoms of withdrawal from it, as he is weaned from the grips of his addiction. Once his head becomes clear again, he begins to learn from the Samurai villagers' ways, being influenced by their strong principles and stoic way of life. It is through their cultural mindset that he begins to free his mind from the shackles of the nightmarish suffering that has dogged his troubled mind for so long. Indeed, Captain Algren experiences the personal growth and enlightenment that changes lives and raises one's consciousness above darkness and despair.It is during this portion of the story that the ""meat"" of the movie lies. It is here that Algren begins to see life from a different perspective. The Samurai's life is a simple one that focuses on virtues espoused by The Samurai Way; values such as honor, integrity, respect, courage, justice, wisdom, etc. The way the villagers were portrayed in the film remind me of a real-life Samurai named Yamamoto Tsunetomo, who once said in a compilation of his writings entitled ""Hagakure"" that one should: ""be true to the thought of the moment and avoid distraction. Other than continuing to exert yourself, enter into nothing else, but go to the extent of living single thought by single thought."" (Hagakure, p. 69). Much of the village's daily life in this movie is summed up quite well by that maxim.In my view, Western culture, though I am fond of it because it is enticingly vivacious, does appear to be soulless and material-based when compared to Eastern Asian cultures. Fast paced, rather emotionally detached, and primarily concerned with wealth, true happiness and peace-of-mind seems to disproportionately elude the advocates of Western values versus supporters of Eastern Asian values. But people and relationships are portrayed as being of high value in Katsumoto's village. Artificiality has no home there; their thoughts are focused on the truly important things in life. They spend most of their time on attaining enlightenment and perfecting whatever craft they have chosen to perform in life. The Samurai Way encompasses a broad variety of topics, much of which are elaborated on much further throughout the storytelling in the movie.The Last Samurai is a fantastic movie with a profound message and beautiful cinematography. The acting is top-notch, as Cruise and Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto) pull off a magnificent performance with excellent chemistry. You will be left satisfied and perhaps even moved. I certainly was, and I liked it so much that I intend to view the film several times more.",5,The Journey of a Lost Soul and the Story a Dying Culture,1082160000,"04 17, 2004",2004,5941,"['Just',

Bayerl ""Specialist in having fun""","[3, 3]","I went to see this film in the hopes of seeing some good action and perhaps a bit of engaging plot concerning the history of modern Japan, and I'll admit, I was not disappointed.  Still, I think the fans of Tom Cruise and the modern Hollywood presentation would have seen this as more of an overwhelming hit than I did, as I plunked down for 150 minutes of what was, after all, the fabled silver screen that had so entertained me as a kid in the 1970s.  What it looked like, more than anything else, was a new entry in the style of shoot-em-up (or slice-em-up) Western movies, as indeed the time setting would make it, at 1876 - 1877.  Cpt. Algren, late of Custer's fame in the post-bellum Indian campaigns, is off to assist the nascently forward-looking empire of Japan, who seems to be having its own trouble with stubborn indigenous folk.  In taking a newly-formed conscript army to the field against the nobly-savage Samurai (are these the same ""Samurai"" I remember there being seven of?), he comes face-to-face with who they really are, under the care of the gracious Taka (Koyuki), who bids him to carry on the tradition of her family's honor, using his ""mind"".  Don't worry, the ""mushy"" parts aren't all that frequent, as in the typical John Wayne or James Stewart classic, so the younger boys won't have to keep their eyes shut long.  I was indeed struck by the immense quality of the cinematography, on what appeared to be a 2.35:1 aspect screen, and the action buffs will be thrilled by all of the assorted combat, both hand-to-hand and (one-sidedly) firearms-related.  Students of Japanese will approve of the dialogue (including by Cruise) in that language, though I had to keep my glasses fully on to read the subtitles.  My overall effect, upon walking back into reality, 127 years later, was one of feeling good.  This is what we earn our entertainment dollars (or Euros, Yen) to buy, and it was well worth it.

808346,A2A5IOAP5QCK5P,B0001JXOUS,"""reel07""","[8, 9]","The story:Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a Civil War Captain, haunted by memories of Custer's raid, who is hired to train the Japanese army the western way with artillery to fight in combat against the samurai.  But one day in battle, he is wounded and captured by the enemy.  The strength and determination Algren shows in defending himself against the samurai fascinates the leader of the samurai, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).  Katsumoto begins speaking with Algren and learning more about him, and Algren finds himself slowly learning the way of the samurai and adopting the lifestyle of the villagers around him.  As the story unfolds, he begins turning more and more into a samurai and eventually winds up fighting for them.The lowdown:Edward Zwick, who made ""Glory"" directs this film with the eye of an artist. The entertaining film moves at a brisk pace, and it is always fascinating to watch Algren's character change as he sees another world in a village perched high on a mountain in supposedly ""enemy"" territory.  The film's beautiful colors and long shots, brought to life by the great John Toll (Thin Red Line), takes us to a world of another day.  The other highlight is the score by Hans Zimmer, one of my favorite composers (Black Hawk Down, Thin Red Line, etc.)  These two technical aspects help the film a great deal, and help draw us into the conflicting worlds of old Japan and new Japan; the artillery and the samurai sword.  The vivid imagery brings to mind the great films of Kurosawa; the heavy rain dripping down a thatched roof or two men practicing a duel on a field high on a mountain reminds us of ""Seven Samurai;"" the long shots of samurai colors and soldiers resembles ""Kagemusha"" and ""Ran.""  Tom Cruise does a fine job in the role of Algren, though I think another actor would have been more fitting, as Cruise is more of a modern and contemporary actor.  Even his voice is just too modern to be thrown into the late 1800s.  But still, he makes his character convincing.  The Japanese actors, especially Watanabe help the film a lot.With that said, this is a very good movie, but not a great one.  The film panders to  clich&eacute;s and Hollywood formulas too much at times, and the script is nearly not as deep as the visuals.  At times, Zwick seems to walk the thin line between being an artist and a hack.  The characters and dialogue are adequate, but not profound or heavily insightful like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (an unfair comparison for any movie) or even recently ""Master and Commander.""  I mention these two films, because these are both grand epics that are as focused on their characters and conflicts as they are with action and battle scenes.  Deep character development is key in a story like this, because there are many conflicts within: A man searching for identity, a battle between an old and new world, a battle between cultures.  The film does not delve deeply enough into these matters, but it is still entertaining and at times even thought-provoking.  The battle scenes are well staged, but those who have seen a Kurosawa movie, specifically ""Seven Samurai,"" ""Kagemusha,"" or ""Ran,"" probably might start thinking of those films upon watching this.  One can't help but think as grand and spectacular Kurosawa's colors and battle scenes were, there lay a heart, a soul, a deep meaning about life and people behind those epic canvas shots of war and blood.  There was a message about life in all of Kurosawa's films, and here a rather straightforward story is told in a clear-cut manner.There are quiet, reflective, and beautiful moments, such as Algren journaling his thoughts as he observes the Japanese village around him, or Algren adopting the way of the samurai.  And as I said before, all these scenes are fueled by great cinematography by John Toll and powerful music by Hans Zimmer.This is a flawed epic, but not a mess like last year's much anticipated ""Gangs of New York.""  ""The Last Samurai"" scratches the surface of the many great samurai films and Kurosawa's depth and is not as multi-layered as it should be, but there is enough fighting and entertainment to keep mainstream audiences content.  Nevertheless, the film is beautiful to look at, entertaining, well-done, and as I said before, has an amazing soundtrack (see my review of the soundtrack).  This is definitely miles ahead of a lot of garbage released these days and is highly recommended.",4,The Last Samurai,1071273600,"12 13, 2003",2003,4414,"['story', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'Civil', 'War', 'Captain', 'haunted', 'memories', 'Custer', 'raid', 'who', 'hired', 'train', 'Japanese', 'army', 'western', 'way', 'artillery', 'fight', 'combat', 'samurai', 'one', 'day', 'battle', 'wounded', 'captured', 'enemy', 'strength', 'determination', 'Algren', 'defending', 'samurai', 'leader', 'samurai', 'Katsumoto', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'Katsumoto', 'speaking', 'Algren', 'learning', 'more', 'Algren', 'slowly', 'learning', 'way', 'samurai', 'adopting', 'lifestyle', 'villagers', 'story', 'unfolds', 'turning', 'more', 'more', 'samurai', 'eventually', 'up', 'fighting', 'them.The', 'lowdown', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'who', 'made', 'Glory', 'film', 'eye', 'artist', 'entertaining', 'film', 'moves', 'brisk', 'pace', 'always', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Algren', 'character', 'change', 'world', 'village', 'perched', 'high', 'mountain', 'supposedly', 'enemy', 'territory', 'film', 'beautiful', 'colors', 'long', 'shots', 'brought', 'life', 'great', 'John', 'Toll', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'world', 'day', 'other', 'highlight', 'score', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'one', 'favorite', 'composers', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'etc', 'two', 'technical', 'aspects', 'help', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'help', 'draw', 'conflicting', 'worlds', 'old', 'Japan', 'new', 'Japan', 'artillery', 'samurai', 'sword', 'vivid', 'imagery', 'mind', 'great', 'films', 'Kurosawa', 'heavy', 'rain', 'dripping', 'down', 'thatched', 'roof', 'two', 'men', 'practicing', 'duel', 'field', 'high', 'mountain', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'long', 'shots', 'samurai', 'colors', 'soldiers', 'resembles', 'Kagemusha', 'Ran', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'fine', 'job', 'role', 'Algren', 'think', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fitting', 'Cruise', 'more', 'modern', 'contemporary', 'actor', 'Even', 'voice', 'just', 'too', 'modern', 'be', 'thrown', 'late', '1800s', 'still', 'character', 'convincing', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'especially', 'Watanabe', 'help', 'film', 'lot.With', 'said', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'film', 'panders', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'Hollywood', 'formulas', 'too', 'much', 'times', 'script', 'nearly', 'not', 'as', 'deep', 'visuals', 'times', 'Zwick', 'walk', 'thin', 'line', 'being', 'artist', 'hack', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'are', 'adequate', 'not', 'profound', 'heavily', 'insightful', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'unfair', 'comparison', 'movie', 'even', 'recently', 'Master', 'Commander', 'mention', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'grand', 'epics', 'are', 'focused', 'characters', 'conflicts', 'are', 'action', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Deep', 'character', 'development', 'key', 'story', 'are', 'many', 'conflicts', 'man', 'searching', 'identity', 'battle', 'old', 'new', 'world', 'battle', 'cultures', 'film', 'not', 'delve', 'deeply', 'enough', 'matters', 'still', 'entertaining', 'times', 'even', 'thought-provoking', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'staged', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Kurosawa', 'movie', 'specifically', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'Kagemusha', 'Ran', 'probably', 'might', 'start', 'thinking', 'films', 'watching', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'grand', 'spectacular', 'Kurosawa', 'colors', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'heart', 'soul', 'deep', 'meaning', 'life', 'people', 'epic', 'canvas', 'shots', 'war', 'blood', 'was', 'message', 'life', 'Kurosawa', 'films', 'here', 'rather', 'straightforward', 'story', 'told', 'clear-cut', 'manner.There', 'are', 'quiet', 'reflective', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'such', 'Algren', 'journaling', 'thoughts', 'Japanese', 'village', 'Algren', 'adopting', 'way', 'samurai', 'said', 'scenes', 'are', 'fueled', 'great', 'cinematography', 'John', 'Toll', 'powerful', 'music', 'Hans', 'Zimmer.This', 'flawed', 'epic', 'not', 'mess', 'last', 'year', 'much', 'anticipated', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'surface', 'many', 'great', 'samurai', 'films', 'Kurosawa', 'depth', 'not', 'as', 'multi-layered', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'fighting', 'entertainment', 'keep', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'content', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'beautiful', 'look', 'entertaining', 'well-done', 'said', 'amazing', 'soundtrack', 'see', 'review', 'soundtrack', 'definitely', 'miles', 'ahead', 'lot', 'garbage', 'released', 'days', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Tom Cruise carries the film brilliantly and outshines any other cast member by far, partly because his character was the only one that was shown to develop.The message of the film is a very positive one, that of honor and courage, even in the face of unbeatable odds, a code almost completely foreign to the average American. Even with this, it's a still a somewhat depressing film, watching the demise of an ancient and majestic society, which was traded in for the pop culture of the West.At times the action was a little overwhelming for this type of film. At one point there was an attack from ninjas that almost degenerated into Kill Bill Vol. 1 - a little too much ninja for the epic journey film maybe.

And of course the US was there to provide and sell weapons and military training to kill the simple, less technological natives.Cruise plays a tortured yet heroic character, asurvivor of the Civil War and Indian wars who stands up to the commercial, US and japanese forces who are attempting to wipe out the last of the Samurais. He stands up to these powers because it is the right thing, the noble thing to do.Why don't we see American warriors standing up. It is almost impossible for men and women GIs in Iraq to speak out. But where are the veterans who can see that the Iraq quagmire has been a bumbling fraud, built on lies and stupid unpreparedness. Where are the brave men and women who fought in Iraq in 1991 to free Kuwait, who should clearly see what a horrific travesty the Bush administration machinations have been.The movie was one of the best of the year, with Oscar caliber acting, script, set, and costumes, in a season with a plethora of disappointing films. I left with a glow in my heart and feeling both inspired and disgusted-- inspired by the heroic actions Tom Cruise portrays, disgusted by the way the US government has had a history of helping in the wiping out of indigenous noble cultures.

808360,A2E1QZ5YSHVQXL,B0001JXOUS,Rocky,"[5, 6]","What a film. It tells of honor, tradition, and courage beyond what any army can give nowadays. These kind of movies show you how violent and moronic we have grown nowadays, for we truly no longer count on our skills- all we do count on is machines and the accuracy of them instead. But the Samurai were true heroes, because they depended on their own strength and bravery. That's how all our ancestors fought, and unlike nowadays, they fought only for good reasons, such as the defense of their homelands, and their very honor.I don't care what anyone says, Cruise was a great actor in this movie, but it's cool with Tom, for many scolded him as Lestat in Interview with the Vampire, and look how he excelled in that film. Played as a Civil War hero who you could say sank into a deep depression due to how he achieved his status as a hero, he is sent to Japan to teach the Japenese troops to use modern weapons for war. But opposing this modern weaponary is a group called the Samurai, who prove to be more than a mere group of rebels. Cruise becomes captive to the Samurai, and at first doesn't want nothing to do with them, especially the leader of the Samurai, Watanabe, but then naturally, he sees and learns that there was a whole other world outside of his, and it was a much more stronger and wiser world that his newly built world had forgotten long ago.Cruise and Watanabe were both spectacular, and they both brung the movie alive. It was another war movie yes, and I've seen so many, but there was a lot more spiritual meaning to this film than with other war films, a much more profound meaning.This was a truly captivating film to witness, and I recommend it to all.",4,Another War Film...But Indeed Fantastical,1089158400,"07 7, 2004",2004,1680,"['What', 'film', 'honor', 'tradition', 'courage', 'what', 'army', 'can', 'give', 'nowadays', 'kind', 'movies', 'show', 'how', 'violent', 'moronic', 'have', 'grown', 'nowadays', 'truly', 'no', 'longer', 'count', 'skills-', 'do', 'count', 'machines', 'accuracy', 'instead', 'Samurai', 'were', 'true', 'heroes', 'depended', 'own', 'strength', 'bravery', 'how', 'ancestors', 'fought', 'nowadays', 'fought', 'only', 'good', 'reasons', 'such', 'defense', 'homelands', 'very', 'honor.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'anyone', 'Cruise', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'movie', 'cool', 'Tom', 'many', 'scolded', 'Lestat', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'look', 'how', 'excelled', 'film', 'Played', 'Civil', 'War', 'hero', 'who', 'could', 'say', 'sank', 'deep', 'depression', 'due', 'how', 'achieved', 'status', 'hero', 'sent', 'Japan', 'teach', 'Japenese', 'troops', 'use', 'modern', 'weapons', 'war', 'opposing', 'modern', 'weaponary', 'group', 'called', 'Samurai', 'who', 'prove', 'be', 'more', 'mere', 'group', 'rebels', 'Cruise', 'captive', 'Samurai', 'first', ""n't"", 'want', 'nothing', 'do', 'especially', 'leader', 'Samurai', 'Watanabe', 'then', 'naturally', 'was', 'whole', 'other', 'world', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'stronger', 'wiser', 'world', 'newly', 'built', 'world', 'had', 'forgotten', 'long', 'ago.Cruise', 'Watanabe', 'were', 'spectacular', 'brung', 'movie', 'alive', 'was', 'war', 'movie', 'yes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'there', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'spiritual', 'meaning', 'film', 'other', 'war', 'films', 'much', 'more', 'profound', 'meaning.This', 'was', 'truly', 'captivating', 'film', 'witness', 'recommend']",N/A

A Civil War era soldier who finds himself thrown in the middle of a different culture and ends up embracing it and becoming part of it.However, Edward Zwick's film differs from the Kevin Costner Oscar winner in that the principal character, Lt. Nathan Algren (Cruise) is down on his luck, having become a drunken caricature of his former self, deeply regretful of his actions, who accepts a job as an instructor for an incipient Japanese army that needs to be prepared to fight against the Samurai.As he arrives to Tokyo he starts training a useless bunch of would-be soldiers who are sent to fight even if they're not ready for it. As a result, the newly formed army gets butchered by the battle experienced Samurai. During that battle, Algren fights bravely and kills one of the highest ranking warriors, getting the interest of the famed Katsumoto, the last great Samurai leader, who orders him captured and brought to his son's village as a prisoner.Once there, Algren's life is changed forever as he gets to know the real lifestyle of the Samurai and their people. They turn out not to be the savages that the Japanese government makes them out to be. After spending winter with them, Algren ""changes sides"" and joins the Samurai in fighting the Emperor's army.The title of the movie tells the final outcome. The Samurai lose the battle. Progress triumphs over tradition. New over old. But Algren's past demons are redeemed by his courageous actions helping the Samurai.The true worth of this movie is its look. You can definetely see where the budget went (other than Cruise's salary). A whole village was built and the attention to detail is astonishing. The costumes are simply amazing, especially the battle armors. The costume designer is Ngila Dickson, who also worked in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy.Also of notice are the battle scenes, which are breathtaking. Very violent, but not gratuitous, they serve the story very well.As for the acting, Cruise does a fine job, and is slowly but consistently becoming a better actor (even if this particular performance was not nominated for an Academy Award), but the movie belongs to Ken Watanabe (who was indeed nominated) as Katsumoto. His presence demands attention. He is the center of every scene he's in.

808362,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B0001JXOUS,Roger J. Buffington,"[2, 2]","This movie succeeds in its primary objective: it entertains.  There is a solid story here that engages the viewer, moves at a smart pace, and never drags.  Nor is this a shallow shoot-'em-up.  There is a fascinating overarching theme here: the transformation of Japan into a modern, industrial nation and the fact that elements of Japanese society, i.e. the Samurai, will not easily fit into the new order of things.While this film has historical inaccuracies, it is a fact that there were revolts against the Meiji Restoration, which is what this film is about.  The Japanese are portrayed respectfully, and I think accurately, in this film.  The sets and scenery, by the way, in this film are about as good as you will ever find in any movie, and this one rewards the viewer who either sees it in a theater or on a first-class flat-screen TV (as I did.)Tom Cruise does a pretty good job in this film, and he has plainly matured as an actor over the years.  In my opinion, however, Ken Wantanabe, as the main Japanese protagonist, dominates every scene he was in, leaving the viewer wishing for more.  I have noticed this about Cruise (and other big-star) films--the director seems compelled to place Cruise in almost every scene.  Nothing against Cruise, but a little less would have been more, because the Japanese cast was engaging and competent, and I would have liked to have seen more of them.Overall an excellent film to which the viewer will return more than once.

808363,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001JXOUS,Roland E. Zwick,"[20, 42]","Set in 1870's Japan, ""The Last Samurai"" is most effective when it sticks to the harsh realities of its blood- soaked battle scenes and avoids the softening effects of its two-bit philosophizing.Tom Cruise is stoic and stolid as Nathan Algren, a former captain of the United States army who is having trouble coming to grips with the part he played in slaughtering a village of innocent American Indians.  Now drifting aimlessly through life, Algren disinterestedly agrees to go to Japan to help train its military in the ways of modern warfare so that the nation's leaders can take on and destroy the sole remnants of the samurai forces who are still using swords as weapons.  Once he is captured by the ""enemy,"" however, Algren falls under the spell of the Samurai Code of Honor and switches his allegiance in battle, ending up fighting with the samurai (whom he views as the equivalent of ""Indian underdogs"" in the struggle) against the people he was brought over to train.  The film, thus, becomes a study in redemption as this one man attempts to find his place in the scheme of things and to erase the life-crippling guilt of his past actions.Director Edward Zwick, who made one of the best war films of modern times (""Glory""), has had less success here, mainly because he stacks the deck so shamelessly in favor of the samurai that we can't help feeing manipulated all throughout the film.  In many ways, ""The Last Samurai"" is as guilty of one-sidedness as those old time Westerns that used to portray the Indians as faceless savages and the White Man as noble adventurers and heroes.  Each perspective seems equally unhistorical and phony.  It's hard for us to see much meaning in Algren's redemption when the people he is following spend much of their time garroting themselves and chopping off one another's heads.  And all the talk about ""honor,"" ""shame,"" the beauty of cherry blossoms and getting in touch with the inner self through a zen-type lifestyle don't amount to too much when we stand back and realize that the samurai were basically bloody warriors who often terrorized the general populous with their acts of brutality and violence.  The makers of the film want us to see a vast moral chasm separating the samurai from both the Japanese military and the evil American colonials who support them, but it is, ultimately, a distinction without a difference.  So when we are asked to cheer on Algren and his compatriots in battle or weep over their fate, the movie loses its grip on us in a major way.  The film becomes just another case of glorifying and romanticizing a way of life that we somehow suspect was a bit less noble and honorable than we have always been led to believe by the countless movies on the subject.Technically, ""The Last Samurai"" is a mighty impressive achievement.  In addition to the eye-catching vistas of rural Japan and a beautifully recreated 19th Century city, the film's large-scaled battle sequences have been stunningly mounted and executed - though the faint-of-heart should note that the body count on screen is enormous and the blood flows generously throughout.  There are, also, some admittedly touching moments scattered throughout the film, though the Hollywood corn is never too far from the surface (particularly in Algren's romantic attachment to the wife of a man he killed).""The Last Samurai"" is a joy to look at, but its unsubtle approach to its material and lack of evenhandedness make it far less meaningful and moving than, I'm sure, it both wanted and intended to be.",3,An American in Japan,1073692800,"01 10, 2004",2004,3536,"['Set', '1870', 'Japan', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'most', 'effective', 'when', 'harsh', 'realities', 'blood-', 'soaked', 'battle', 'scenes', 'softening', 'effects', 'two-bit', 'philosophizing.Tom', 'Cruise', 'stoic', 'stolid', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'former', 'captain', 'United', 'States', 'army', 'who', 'having', 'trouble', 'coming', 'grips', 'part', 'played', 'slaughtering', 'village', 'innocent', 'American', 'Indians', 'Now', 'drifting', 'aimlessly', 'life', 'Algren', 'disinterestedly', 'go', 'Japan', 'help', 'train', 'military', 'ways', 'modern', 'warfare', 'nation', 'leaders', 'can', 'take', 'destroy', 'sole', 'remnants', 'samurai', 'forces', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'using', 'swords', 'weapons', 'Once', 'captured', 'enemy', 'however', 'Algren', 'spell', 'Samurai', 'Code', 'Honor', 'allegiance', 'battle', 'ending', 'up', 'fighting', 'samurai', 'whom', 'equivalent', 'Indian', 'underdogs', 'struggle', 'people', 'was', 'brought', 'over', 'train', 'film', 'thus', 'study', 'redemption', 'one', 'man', 'find', 'place', 'scheme', 'things', 'erase', 'life-crippling', 'guilt', 'past', 'actions.Director', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'who', 'made', 'one', 'best', 'war', 'films', 'modern', 'times', 'Glory', 'had', 'less', 'success', 'here', 'mainly', 'deck', 'so', 'shamelessly', 'favor', 'samurai', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeing', 'manipulated', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'guilty', 'one-sidedness', 'old', 'time', 'used', 'portray', 'Indians', 'faceless', 'savages', 'White', 'Man', 'noble', 'adventurers', 'heroes', 'perspective', 'equally', 'unhistorical', 'phony', 'hard', 'see', 'much', 'meaning', 'Algren', 'redemption', 'when', 'people', 'following', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'garroting', 'chopping', 'off', 'one', 'heads', 'talk', 'honor', 'shame', 'beauty', 'cherry', 'blossoms', 'getting', 'touch', 'inner', 'self', 'zen-type', 'lifestyle', 'do', ""n't"", 'amount', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'stand', 'back', 'realize', 'samurai', 'were', 'basically', 'bloody', 'warriors', 'who', 'often', 'terrorized', 'general', 'populous', 'acts', 'brutality', 'violence', 'makers', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'vast', 'moral', 'chasm', 'separating', 'samurai', 'Japanese', 'military', 'evil', 'American', 'colonials', 'who', 'support', 'ultimately', 'distinction', 'difference', 'So', 'when', 'are', 'asked', 'cheer', 'Algren', 'compatriots', 'battle', 'weep', 'fate', 'movie', 'grip', 'major', 'way', 'film', 'just', 'case', 'glorifying', 'romanticizing', 'way', 'life', 'somehow', 'suspect', 'was', 'bit', 'less', 'noble', 'honorable', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'led', 'believe', 'countless', 'movies', 'subject.Technically', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'mighty', 'impressive', 'achievement', 'addition', 'eye-catching', 'vistas', 'rural', 'Japan', 'beautifully', 'recreated', '19th', 'Century', 'city', 'film', 'large-scaled', 'battle', 'sequences', 'have', 'been', 'stunningly', 'mounted', 'executed', 'faint-of-heart', 'should', 'note', 'body', 'count', 'screen', 'enormous', 'blood', 'generously', 'are', 'also', 'admittedly', 'touching', 'moments', 'scattered', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'corn', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'surface', 'particularly', 'Algren', 'romantic', 'attachment', 'wife', 'man', 'killed', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'joy', 'look', 'unsubtle', 'approach', 'material', 'lack', 'evenhandedness', 'make', 'far', 'less', 'meaningful', 'moving', ""'m"", 'sure', 'wanted', 'intended', 'be']",N/A

The main story is a reverent account of the character of the Japanese people and the Samurai in particular, but there's much more to it than simply that.  The film has many subplots and resolves them all neatly without ever seeming contrived.  Everything from Algren's (Tom Cruise) search for peace to his understated yet elegant love story with Taka (Koyuki) is handled as well as it conceivably could be.  Writer John Logan avoids the overwrought melodrama that burdens most war movies; everything is as quietly graceful as the Samurai way of living depicted within the film.The acting is, on every front, excellent.  Tom Cruise gives an uncharacteristically melancholy performance as Captain Nathan Algren, while Ken Watanabe perfectly encapsulates the quiet honor of Samurai leader Katsumoto.  The actors cast in the supporting roles are equally suited to the film, each giving realistic and powerful performances by turns.Director Edward Zwick infuses the entire film with the necessary serene feel.  He uses well-placed camera angles to complement and enhance the already magnificent sets, and even cliched choices (such as Algren's choppy, blurred memories) are handled competently.  The only area that Zwick falls a little short in is in his directing of the action.  Despite the R rating of the film, he displays a timidity in his direction which, at times, makes it blatantly obvious that these are stunts.  Even still, this movie is not an action film, and it's appropriate that Zwick kept it from becoming a visceral bloodbath.  This isn't too say that there aren't graphic depictions of violence, but Zwick generally avoids the blatant displays which fill movies like &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, preferring to quickly cut away from gory moments.If &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; has a real problem, it's that the story is about somewhat immaterial concepts: tradition, honor, and the character of a culture.  It can be difficult to emotionally connect with things of such abstract nature, but even still, it's as elegant a defense of such things as the moviegoer is likely to find.  And the stories of the characters and their relationships within this defense are powerful enough to provide more than enough emotional resonance to compensate.In a year that saw the release of many excellent films, &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is among the best.  Patient, mature viewers will find much to admire herein, though those seeking a light-hearted action romp may wish to look elsewhere.",5,Serene Elegance in a Tom Cruise Film,1084233600,"05 11, 2004",2004,2563,"['quot', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'was', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2003', 'main', 'story', 'reverent', 'account', 'character', 'Japanese', 'people', 'Samurai', 'particular', 'much', 'more', 'simply', 'film', 'many', 'subplots', 'neatly', 'ever', 'seeming', 'contrived', 'Everything', 'Algren', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'search', 'peace', 'understated', 'yet', 'elegant', 'love', 'story', 'Taka', 'Koyuki', 'handled', 'as', 'well', 'conceivably', 'could', 'be', 'Writer', 'John', 'Logan', 'overwrought', 'melodrama', 'most', 'war', 'movies', 'everything', 'as', 'quietly', 'graceful', 'Samurai', 'way', 'living', 'depicted', 'film.The', 'acting', 'front', 'excellent', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'uncharacteristically', 'melancholy', 'performance', 'Captain', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'perfectly', 'quiet', 'honor', 'Samurai', 'leader', 'Katsumoto', 'actors', 'cast', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'equally', 'suited', 'film', 'giving', 'realistic', 'powerful', 'performances', 'turns.Director', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'entire', 'film', 'necessary', 'serene', 'feel', 'well-placed', 'camera', 'angles', 'complement', 'enhance', 'already', 'magnificent', 'sets', 'even', 'cliched', 'choices', 'such', 'Algren', 'choppy', 'blurred', 'memories', 'are', 'handled', 'competently', 'only', 'area', 'Zwick', 'little', 'short', 'directing', 'action', 'R', 'rating', 'film', 'timidity', 'direction', 'times', 'blatantly', 'are', 'stunts', 'Even', 'still', 'movie', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'appropriate', 'Zwick', 'kept', 'becoming', 'visceral', 'bloodbath', ""n't"", 'too', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'graphic', 'depictions', 'violence', 'Zwick', 'generally', 'blatant', 'displays', 'fill', 'movies', 'quot', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'quot', 'preferring', 'quickly', 'cut', 'away', 'gory', 'moments.If', 'quot', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'real', 'problem', 'story', 'somewhat', 'immaterial', 'concepts', 'tradition', 'honor', 'character', 'culture', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'emotionally', 'connect', 'things', 'such', 'abstract', 'nature', 'even', 'still', 'elegant', 'defense', 'such', 'things', 'moviegoer', 'likely', 'find', 'stories', 'characters', 'relationships', 'defense', 'are', 'powerful', 'enough', 'provide', 'more', 'enough', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'compensate.In', 'year', 'saw', 'release', 'many', 'excellent', 'films', 'quot', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'best', 'Patient', 'mature', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'admire', 'herein', 'seeking', 'light-hearted', 'action', 'romp', 'may', 'wish', 'look', 'elsewhere']",N/A

Other reviewers have pointed out many ridiculous things about this movie.  Here are the ones I think are the most prevalent.1. The historical and cultural reality of this movie is flipped to where the dwindling noble samurai are the good guys and the big mean Japanese government advised by the dastardly US is the bad guy.2. The time it takes Tom Cruise to learn the ""ways"" of the samurai is extremely short, and the Samurai people he lives among, for the most part, seem to not have a problem with this outsider, despite their history of not accepting people outside of Japan.3. It is in your face about the Indian Wars and the atrocities the ""white man"" inflicted on the Native Americans, and how US influence in Japan was evil and sinister in nature.  Not to mention it ""corrupts"" the culture that was once innocent in it's lack of industrialization and modern technology.another stupid thing that others have pointed out is how the samurai are portrayed as only using the archaic sword and bow, while the evil government uses modern mechanized weapons.  This is BS, because the Samurai had been using guns since the 1600s just like much of the world.  This is typical for movies like it.  The poor weak natives who are nice to the earth and use thing that don't do little to no harm to the planet, while the big evil bad guys don't care and whatever they want to the earth.  I'm not necessarily saying they did this on purpose, but it is typical.In closing, this movie sucks! It's an overly used storyline that is exactly like  Dances With Wolves, Avatar, ect.  The only difference being it's set in Japan.

Also, the historical inaccuracies are difficult to swallow, as is the fact that Cruise's character actually survives all of the experiences that he goes through.  It gets old seeing Hollywood ""heroes"" go to different countries and lead people from a different culture in battle all the time.  It's also a bit disconcerting that his character is basically Dunbar from ""Dances with Wolves,"" albeit in a much more violent setting.  I really loved watching the cultural elements of the movie, the acting is very good, and it's beautifully filmed, but this is one that loses much of its appeal as I think about it the next day.Also, be careful if you buy the inexpensive DVD version--there are no extras at all.

808375,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0001JXOUS,Samuel McKewon,"[4, 5]","Former Paramount studios chief Robert Evans used to call his holiday pictures ""Christmas gifts to the world,"" and ""The Last Samurai"" is staged just so: Much of it is handsome, magnificent and morally decent, yet the movie is full of itself, in both solemnity and faraway gaze. Edward Zwick's latest giant is in need of a bit of exuberance to push it over into classic status, and the director never quite gets enough of it, and certainly not from star Tom Cruise, in permanent furrowed brow.Developed from an interesting story by John Logan, ""The Last Samurai"" concerns Capt. Nathan Algren (Cruise), a drunk, disillusioned cavalry solider in 1870s hired to train a ""modernized"" Japanese army defeat the legendary mountain samurais, whose ""bushido"" code of discipline has long defended the nation. The samurai are led by their last great fighter, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), fight by sword and bow, and have the fealty of the people. The upwardly mobile Japanese ambassador Omura (Masato Harada) has the ear of the young emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura).Bushido code is such that Katsumoto would drop his sword if the emperor wished it so; until then, he leads charges against green Japanese troops. In one battle, pitched in the forest by fog light, he wounds Algren, captures him and ushers the captain to a mountain hideout to study his recovering enemy. The samurai village is beautifully realized; Zwick and cinematographer John Toll (""Braveheart"") purposely create a utopia at high elevation. With a valley in the distance reminiscent of a fertile green ocean, Algren begins to adjust to the mood and practice of the warriors and prove himself worthy of it while kindling a romance with a samurai's widow (beautiful, expressive Koyuki).While Katsumoto may belong to an ancient order, he speaks English, displays a quick sense of humor and seeks to trade wisdom with Algren rather than merely dispensing it. His philosophy is unbending, but his moods aren't. Watanabe is so good because he plays against the expectation of the stern, authoritarian titan, and, with a smile, steals most of the scenes away from Cruise, who affects the broken man about as well as a naturally expressive actor can.Inevitably, Algren wins a few mock battles and stands beside Katsumoto during a midnight ninja attack, setting the stage for Algren's conflicted return back to his old post in Tokyo, then his subsequent change of heart that leads to fierce final battle between tradition and guns, played out in the valley we've seen from afar the entire movie.Four-act films are rare, but Zwick doesn't fight the built-in structure, uses it, in fact to cover all the political bases, punctuating the end of each with a clash of some sort. The ninja raid has a hint of Kurosawa, while the forest sequences echoes the Vietnam movies of Stone and Coppola. The final battle is a close cousin to ""Braveheart"" and deserves to be mentioned with it. Cruise and Watanabe worked the swords themselves, and betray no weaknesses. Zwick is a fabulous combat director, and considering the movie's scope, deserves a mention during awards season.""The Last Samurai"" never quite reconciles what movie it prefers to be. It forces a romance between Algren and Taka, the widow, when there's no time to develop it. It tacks on a needless, uplifting epilogue to a naturally earth-moving conclusion. The movie errs on the side of being disconsolate, too, in portraying the one-dimensionally evil Omura and Col. Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), one of Algren's former superiors who enjoyed slaughtering innocents in Indian raids. Such stark lines of romance and villainy detract from the movie's underlying elegy of samurais courting death against the machines.",4,A beautiful requiem for traditional warriors of all kinds,1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,3706,"['Former', 'Paramount', 'studios', 'chief', 'Robert', 'Evans', 'used', 'call', 'holiday', 'Christmas', 'gifts', 'world', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'staged', 'just', 'so', 'Much', 'handsome', 'magnificent', 'morally', 'decent', 'yet', 'movie', 'full', 'solemnity', 'faraway', 'gaze', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'latest', 'giant', 'need', 'bit', 'exuberance', 'push', 'over', 'classic', 'status', 'director', 'never', 'quite', 'enough', 'certainly', 'not', 'star', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'permanent', 'furrowed', 'brow.Developed', 'interesting', 'story', 'John', 'Logan', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'concerns', 'Capt', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'Cruise', 'drunk', 'disillusioned', 'cavalry', 'solider', '1870s', 'hired', 'train', 'modernized', 'Japanese', 'army', 'defeat', 'legendary', 'mountain', 'samurais', 'bushido', 'code', 'discipline', 'long', 'defended', 'nation', 'samurai', 'are', 'led', 'last', 'great', 'fighter', 'Katsumoto', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'fight', 'sword', 'bow', 'have', 'fealty', 'people', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'Japanese', 'ambassador', 'Omura', 'Masato', 'Harada', 'ear', 'young', 'emperor', 'Shichinosuke', 'Nakamura', '.Bushido', 'code', 'such', 'Katsumoto', 'would', 'drop', 'sword', 'emperor', 'wished', 'so', 'then', 'charges', 'green', 'Japanese', 'troops', 'one', 'battle', 'pitched', 'forest', 'fog', 'light', 'Algren', 'ushers', 'captain', 'mountain', 'hideout', 'study', 'recovering', 'enemy', 'samurai', 'village', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'Zwick', 'cinematographer', 'John', 'Toll', 'Braveheart', 'purposely', 'create', 'utopia', 'high', 'elevation', 'valley', 'distance', 'reminiscent', 'fertile', 'green', 'ocean', 'Algren', 'adjust', 'mood', 'practice', 'warriors', 'prove', 'kindling', 'romance', 'samurai', 'widow', 'beautiful', 'expressive', 'Koyuki', 'Katsumoto', 'may', 'belong', 'ancient', 'order', 'English', 'quick', 'sense', 'humor', 'trade', 'wisdom', 'Algren', 'rather', 'merely', 'dispensing', 'philosophy', 'unbending', 'moods', 'are', ""n't"", 'Watanabe', 'so', 'good', 'expectation', 'stern', 'authoritarian', 'titan', 'smile', 'most', 'scenes', 'away', 'Cruise', 'who', 'broken', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'naturally', 'expressive', 'actor', 'can.Inevitably', 'Algren', 'few', 'mock', 'battles', 'stands', 'beside', 'Katsumoto', 'midnight', 'ninja', 'attack', 'setting', 'stage', 'Algren', 'conflicted', 'return', 'back', 'old', 'post', 'Tokyo', 'then', 'subsequent', 'change', 'heart', 'fierce', 'final', 'battle', 'tradition', 'guns', 'played', 'out', 'valley', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'entire', 'movie.Four-act', 'films', 'are', 'rare', 'Zwick', ""n't"", 'fight', 'built-in', 'structure', 'fact', 'cover', 'political', 'bases', 'punctuating', 'end', 'clash', 'sort', 'ninja', 'raid', 'hint', 'Kurosawa', 'forest', 'sequences', 'Vietnam', 'movies', 'Stone', 'Coppola', 'final', 'battle', 'close', 'cousin', 'Braveheart', 'be', 'mentioned', 'Cruise', 'Watanabe', 'worked', 'swords', 'weaknesses', 'Zwick', 'fabulous', 'combat', 'director', 'considering', 'movie', 'scope', 'mention', 'awards', 'season', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'never', 'quite', 'what', 'movie', 'be', 'romance', 'Algren', 'Taka', 'widow', 'when', 'time', 'develop', 'needless', 'uplifting', 'epilogue', 'naturally', 'earth-moving', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'errs', 'side', 'being', 'disconsolate', 'too', 'portraying', 'one-dimensionally', 'evil', 'Omura', 'Col.', 'Bagley', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'one', 'Algren', 'former', 'superiors', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'slaughtering', 'innocents', 'Indian', 'raids', 'Such', 'stark', 'lines', 'romance', 'villainy', 'detract', 'movie', 'underlying', 'elegy', 'samurais', 'courting', 'death', 'machines']",N/A

808379,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0001JXOUS,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 5]","&quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is a beautifully shot film that everyone seems to have thrown themselves into with gusto, but the movie somehow lacks the &quot;oomph&quot; that would have propelled it into the cinematic stratosphere.  The result -- a darn good movie that, with two exceptional aspects, will not be considered a classic (and it could have been!).Directed by Edward Zwick (of the magnificent &quot;Glory&quot;), &quot;Samurai&quot; tells the story of Civil War hero Capt. Nathan Algren (Cruise, in an earnest performance).  The story's parallels to Kevin Costner's &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; are well-documented, but overstated -- Americans have forever been encountering &quot;new&quot; cultures (that have been around for centuries), and it's reasonable to deduce that many Americans (even given our stereotypical egotism, boorishness and hypocrisy that Hollywood loves to play up) would become enamored of these different cultures.It's 1876.  Algren, a self-hating drunk, blows his last chance as spokesman for the Winchester rifle company, but is offered the job of going to the Orient to &quot;kill Jappos.&quot;  The first Japanese who speaks is a despicable character, fat and bewhiskered, who has obviously sold out to Western ideals.  He stands in stark contrast to the first Japanese we see, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe, who steals the movie), the Samurai lord -- we see him in his tranquil village having a vision of a tiger in a scene of stark, lethal beauty.Katsumoto, an honored advisor to the Emperor, is holding out against the Westernization of Japan.  The Fat Japanese Man, also an imperial advisor, has isolated Katsumoto and has apparently steamrolled the Emperor, a young man clearly not up to his imperial obligations, to open Japan to the West.  The goal is obviously to line the pockets of the Fat Japanese Man, and America is eager to get involved in the Westernization of Japan in order to exploit lucrative weapons contracts.  Can you see where this is going?&quot;Samurai&quot; has a very predictable plot, but that should not have prevented it from making a powerful emotional statement.  After all, we know how Hamlet is going to wind up, and it's still an emotional roller-coaster.  &quot;Samurai&quot; certainly gets a lot of the visual elements correct -- the early battle scene involving the cavalry charge of the samurai through the mists, as if emerging from their own mythology, is a triumph.  But overall the film lacks an emotional core that is necessary.Part of this responsibility must lie at Cruise's feet.  It's not for a lack of effort -- Cruise obviously threw himself into this movie with everything he has.  He is just a poor choice for narrator of this particular story.  For one, Cruise does not abandon his anguish at any point in the story.  (In this sense, he's similar to the casting of Leo as the lead in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; -- too surly to be of much interest.)  Contrast Cruise's performance with Costner's in &quot;Wolves&quot; -- Costner achieves a stronger emotional connection with the audience than Cruise does (and that's surprising, 'cause I generally consider Cruise to be a superior actor).The other problem with the movie is that it just moves too darn fast through some important aspects of the story.  For one, the complex problems with the Westernization of Japan should have been given greater depth, as should have the role of the samurai in Japanese society.  We do spend a lot of time with in the samurai village, and we see how important it is to train with weapons.  But we needed to see more about how the imperial advisors favoring Westernization have &quot;sold out&quot; their culture.  By making Katsumoto the only hold-out without much further explanation, it's harder to see Hatsumoto has the honorable preserver of traditions and easier to see him as the last desperate man, too eager to hold onto traditions.Other details seem to have been missed.  At one point, we see the horrible shame for a samurai who has his cherished top-knot hairdo cut off.  But why is it never explained why Katsumoto has a shaved head?  We presume that Katsumoto has the shaved head only because it looks good to the eyes of the Western audience, which is probably not going to find the traditional samurai hairstyle very attractive.  (To be fair, in many other ways the movie gets the look and feel of the period very well.)Ken Watanabe's portrayal of Katsumoto is the movie's high point.  A complex man, capable of great emotion within his samurai stoicism, Katsumoto is intrigued by Algren and learns much from him.  Eventually becoming brothers in arms, Katsumoto and Algren strive to save the samurai and bushido, the samurai code.  Overcoming diplomatic pressure, official ostracism, and a lethal ninja attack, Katsumoto fights a noble battle to its unfortunate and inevitable end.The climactic scene, the last battle of the Katsumoto's samurai against the Western-armed and trained imperial army, is awesome.  Set beautifully against a backdrop of falling cherry blossoms, the samurai evoke their own &quot;charge of the light brigade,&quot; and their sacrifice and refusal to submit is truly ennobling.It's sad that the rest of the film doesn't quite live up to its incredible potential.  This movie dared to tackle a huge, powerful story, and in many ways it works.  It just doesn't quite measure up to what it could have been.The DVD extras are OK -- many interviews and promos, with some interesting details about the art design, but there's nothing to &quot;ooh and ahh&quot; over.  A decent DVD for a very good, but not great, movie.",4,Good flick -- could have/should have been better; so-so DVD,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,5630,"['quot', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'beautifully',

808382,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B0001JXOUS,Sean Pasek,"[7, 8]","Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick set out to make a film that had great spiritual depth, using the samurai ""bushido"" code as the foundation for understanding the culture of the samurai warriors.I found myself watching, in my opinion, a great, spiritual film about a Civil War veteran who has lost himself in guilt and shame for actions done during the Indian campaigns.  He goes to Japan to train the ""new"" soldier, and quickly finds himself the captive the samurai.  A reluctant captive at first, he slowly begins to find himself in the disciplines and codes of these magnificent warriors.Viewers may find some parallels to Dances With Wolves.  This film, in some ways, goes deeper.  One must go deep to truly understand the way of the samurai; brilliant warriors whose job it was to protect and defend.Those familiar with Star Wars will see how and why George Lucas used the samurai as inspiration for his Jedi.The word ""Samurai"" means to serve.  The Bushido code is not just a code of action.  It is a code of BEING.  The samurai demonstrated themselves by being loyal, being compassionate, being honest, etc.  This is a way to live, not only in the past, but more importantly, for today when such concepts are becoming more and more obscure.I thought Tom Cruise did a very good job (although I find myself wondering how much better this film would have been if someone like, Daniel Day-Lewis played the part).  Nathan Algren is taught to face his fears, to put the past behind him, to live and BE in the moment (this he employs during his sword training and first battle in the street).I will also argue that this film has the best ""love"" scene of any movie I've ever seen.  The subtlety and feeling that emerges as Taka is dressing Nathan in his garments, preparing him for battle, is one of the most poignant love scenes I've ever had the pleasure to see on screen.One may argue that the samurai were the villains.  They stood in the way of progress.  They tried to ""hold back"" the tide of modernizing Japan.I find it extremely interesting the most people believe that those who came before us had to have been more primitive.  Scientists and historians alike are quickly finding out that this is not always true...in fact, it seldom is.The Japanese Emperor sums up the words beautifully: ""...we must not forget who we are and where we came from.""  The ""old"" should never be cast aside for the ""new,"" but transcended...to take those qualities from the past and assimilate them into the future.This is a great story, and I feel that the Last Samurai speaks volumes to the way of the warrior and to the way of being.",5,"Epic masterpiece of the ""pure"" warrior",1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,2614,"['Tom', 'Cruise', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'spiritual', 'depth', 'using', 'samurai', 'bushido', 'code', 'foundation', 'understanding', 'culture', 'samurai', 'warriors.I', 'found', 'watching', 'opinion', 'great', 'spiritual', 'film', 'Civil', 'War', 'veteran', 'who', 'lost', 'guilt', 'shame', 'actions', 'done', 'Indian', 'campaigns', 'Japan', 'train', 'new', 'soldier', 'quickly', 'captive', 'samurai', 'reluctant', 'captive', 'first', 'slowly', 'find', 'disciplines', 'codes', 'magnificent', 'warriors.Viewers', 'may', 'find', 'parallels', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'film', 'ways', 'deeper', 'must', 'go', 'deep', 'truly', 'understand', 'way', 'samurai', 'brilliant', 'warriors', 'job', 'was', 'protect', 'defend.Those', 'familiar', 'Star', 'Wars', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'why', 'George', 'Lucas', 'used', 'samurai', 'inspiration', 'Jedi.The', 'word', 'Samurai', 'serve', 'Bushido', 'code', 'not', 'just', 'code', 'action', 'code', 'BEING', 'samurai', 'demonstrated', 'being', 'loyal', 'being', 'compassionate', 'being', 'honest', 'etc', 'way', 'live', 'not', 'only', 'past', 'more', 'importantly', 'today', 'when', 'such', 'concepts', 'are', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'obscure.I', 'thought', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'find', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'played', 'part', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'taught', 'face', 'fears', 'put', 'past', 'live', 'BE', 'moment', 'sword', 'training', 'first', 'battle', 'street', '.I', 'will', 'also', 'argue', 'film', 'best', 'love', 'scene', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'subtlety', 'feeling', 'Taka', 'dressing', 'Nathan', 'garments', 'preparing', 'battle', 'one', 'most', 'poignant', 'love', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'see', 'screen.One', 'may', 'argue', 'samurai', 'were', 'villains', 'stood', 'way', 'progress', 'tried', 'hold', 'back', 'tide', 'modernizing', 'Japan.I', 'find', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'most', 'people', 'believe', 'who', 'came', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'primitive', 'Scientists', 'historians', 'alike', 'are', 'quickly', 'finding', 'out', 'not', 'always', 'true', 'fact', 'seldom', 'Japanese', 'Emperor', 'sums', 'up', 'words', 'beautifully', 'must', 'not', 'forget', 'who', 'are', 'where', 'came', 'old', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'cast', 'aside', 'new', 'transcended', 'take', 'qualities', 'past', 'assimilate', 'future.This', 'great', 'story', 'feel', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'volumes', 'way', 'warrior', 'way', 'being']",N/A

808384,A1MQKL6JLNECGI,B0001JXOUS,Seth Aaron Lowry,"[4, 5]","I have never been a fan of Tom Cruise, but after watching this movie my opinion of him has slowly begin to change.  Granted, Cruise is a good actor, but there are several others I would place ahead of him in terms of acting ability and on camera congeniality.  Nevertheless, I believe The Last Samurai is one of Tom Cruise's best films, if not his best film ever, because he does an outstanding job of portraying the role of Capt. Nathan Algren;  Algren is a Civil War and Indian War veteran who is tortured over the atrocities he has viewed and committed on the front lines.  These experiences have transformed Algren into a man filled with bitterness and cynicism and driven him to embrace alcohol as his escape mechanism from reality.Cruise does an excellent job of capturing this particular spirit in the film.  Even though Cruise's performance is excellent, the film is only bolstered by the performances by the performances of Watanabe and the rest of the cast.  Watanabe was simply terrific as the Samurai warlord, Katsumoto.  On screen he exuded a kind of gentle but stern warrior aura, and showed he was a man of astute intellectual abilities.  In his performace Watanabe displayed all the qualities and characteristics that were essential to the Samurai.  Besides the performances the battle sequences and costumes were spectacular.  In addition, the scenery and setting were also very good and captured the atmosphere of a 19th century Japan that was experiencing rapid Westernization.  At several instances in the film it is easy to see vestiges of traditional Eastern Japansese culture stand side by side with modern Western culture.  Last but not least, the musical score by Hans Zimmer is phenomenal. As always, Zimmer delivers a rousing an emotional score that complements the film and actually heightens the sensitivity at certain crucial moments of the film.My only criticism of this movie is that Tom Cruise was focued upon too much.  It would have been nice if the other characters, Ujio, Taka, and Katsumoto, received more screen time since they were all so likeable and each delivers a great performance.

Not to mention human beings and other creatures. The humans are only a part of the nature. So, like a weed grows and dies, we all are born and die. Simple.Like the American Indians say; ""It is a good day to die today."", famous book of Bushido, the Samurai code, ""Hagakure"" says; ""The ultimate Bushido is found in the way you die.""Here, as well as profoundly understanding the meanings of life and death, accepting one's own life as it is is a crucial point to get through. Because you have your own purpose of life as you are born to the circumstances you were given.And it applies to everybody, not only to the Samurais.For what were you born? For what are you going to die?If you know the answer, you are ready to die in the honourable and graceful way it should be.It is not that only the deaths of Samurais in action or by Harakiri taking responsibility are honourable/graceful. Everyone who has completed his/her duty of his/her life can die in honour and grace.It doesn't mean that Samurais were crazy, trigger-happy suicidal/homicidal maniacs, though. I have to make sure here that nobody misunderstands what I am saying because sometimes some people seem to think that the Kamikaze attacks in the world war 2 were the acts of that kind of insanity. I can tell you how wrong their thoughts are. If you see this film and take it correctly, you should understand that as well.It is a matter of readiness. Your readiness to die makes your life meaningful. Meaningful life makes your soul shine.That is every human being's purpose to be born to this world.Concuerors can destroy your home and kill you, but no one can break your spirit if you are ready to die.What Algren underwent in his battle fields in both America and Japan against and with those ""savages"" made him know that.After a hundred years' struggle against the powers of the Western civilisation, Japan seemed to have narrowly escaped from being colonised and subhumanised only because Japan had a large population that were ready to die for the survival of their country and their people putting themselves together tightly under the name of the Emperor. But, did she, really?""The Last Samurai"" made me think about where I came from and who I am.

The plot, although based on some real events, is clich&eacute;d struggle by a small band against overwhelming odds. After the first glance the outlook brightens, the Cruise character, Nathan Algren, doesn't lead the small band or even effect course of the action much. The result is a Tom Cruise film that doesn't revolve around Tom Cruise and in which Cruise does some genuine acting.One reason Cruise fairs so well is Algren, traumatized and haunted, doesn't have the usual cocky bluster that Cruise relies on so much. The end result is not a stellar performance but may be one of his better ones. Additionally Cruise isn't the real star here, the rest of the mostly Japanese cast is. The Japanese cast are veteran actors but unknown outside of Japan. The cinematography also really stands out. Beautiful outdoor settings in both Japan and New Zealand where shot with care. The music is mix of John Williams-type orchestral arraignments with a Japanese influence.The lack of real antagonist is the one major flaw. Enlisted to stand in for one, are several characters proposing to change Japan into a more modern country similar to the US and Europe, but this is never developed well so it seems the small band of Samari are fighting against, well, something. This contrasts with the real events with a real effort to push the Samari out of their powerful influence in feudal Japan. Since this the conflict is mostly neglected the movie is forced the point out the differences in not-too-subtle ways even giving one central character an 'evil guy' goatee.The Director's Commentary track is good and serviceable but it's just that, the Director's Commentary. Alone the director covers as many topics as possible but the track isn't as broad as commentaries that include other crew members with other specialties. There also isn't any discussion that can make some commentaries so enjoyable. The other special features are a disappointment. Several of the 'documentaries' consist of Cruise and/or the director talking about how great the movie is. The two technical features about wardrobe and weapons are ridiculously short at about five minutes each.And the overwhelming odds plot? That can end in only one of two ways: The small band manages to win or is wiped out out to the last man.

Algren is captured by the samurai and becomes an ally of Katsumoto (Ken Wantanabe), the samurai leader.I'm not a huge Cruise fan, but I do think this is one of his better performances. He seems to have a knack for displaying self-disgust (MAGNOLIA) and he taps into it here. The film's first act is its strongest part. Cruise is believably decrepit, and the opening battle, where the samurai swoop down on the frightened Japanese soldiers, is haunting. Indeed all of the action scenes are very well put together.In the film's middle section, Cruise learns how wonderful it is to be Japanese and follow the way of the Samurai.

Cruise plays a brilliant US army soldier, Captain Algren who has seen one too many battles and is haunted by the horrific injustices dealt to the American Indians by himself and his fellow US soldiers.He is offered a large sum of money to train the Japanese army so that it can fight the last of the rebel Samurai tribes. In the opening battle he is captured by the Samurai and it is then that he can see the parallel with the Indians and eventually switches sides. All this is beautifully filmed and some of the scenes in the Samurai village, when Captain Algren is gradually adapting to the Samurai way of life reminded me of Kevin Costners Dances with Wolves.I am not especially a fan of Tom Cruise but he is good in this.

808395,A8GP5U9H4PNOC,B0001JXOUS,slider,"[5, 10]","Tom Cruise appears in yet another film where he rises to the occassion at just the right time, as he has done in many of his previous films, dating back to Top Gun.  It a repetitive, tiresome theme that would have me looking for another role if I were him.  Don't get me wrong; I like some of his work (Far and Away is one of his best works to date).As for this film, the cinematography and supporting actor roles are it's primary attraction.  It's apparent a lot of research was done to pull off this period piece.  The settings and costumes are beautiful.  Watanabe plays superbly as the Samurai warrior Katsumoto.  He is the real star of this movie.Unfortunately, the plot is entirely predictable.  Cruise is an alcoholic fromer Union Captain named Nathan Algren.  He is sent to Japan to train the new Japanese Imperial Army to fight off the diminishing Samurai warriors.  He leads his Army into battle against the Samurai and is soundly beaten.  Katsumoto spares Algren's life and brings him back to health (queue the music).  Algren learns the way of the Samurai warrior and earns the respect of his Samurai brethren.  Eventually he has to face the very Japanese Army he helped train, this time fighting on the side of the Samurai.This is where it goes from unlikely to absurd.  Cruise and hundreds of remaining Samurai face off with the Imperial Army in a showdown copied several times over since Mel Gibson's Braveheart.  Samurai drop like flies as they charge the inexperienced but better equipped Imperial Army soldiers.  As it turns out (no surprise here), Watanabe and Cruise are the last survivors of the battle.  Though severely wounded by gunfire,  Katsumoto squeezes his abdomen tightly to allow a few more pints of blood to nourish his brain while he performs his farewell speech to Cruise.  He dies and leaves Cruise as.....you guessed it!  The Last Samurai.  I heard that Japanese movie audiences were passing out at the very sight.On a side note, it's rumored that Nathan Algren returned to America and travelled together with Kung Fu through the desert southwest, metting out some pain to those who crossed them.  Unfortunately, Algren returned to the bottle, and in a drunken rage one friday nite, eviscerated Kung Fu at a bar in Tucumcari.  Ironically, Algren died shortly thereafter while drinking numerous Grasshoppers.  He lies in an unmarked grave just outside of Ft.

However, his performance is spot on in my opinion.  You can sense his seriousness and issues with the American army's and his own actions of the war.  You can sense his appreciation of Eastern culture and his experience as a Civil War veteran through his eyes, his body language, and the delivery of his lines.  While I thought seeing Cruise dressed as a samurai would be unbelievable, his performance transforms his character so well that by the end of the movie when he dons the samurai outfit, I was completely convinced.  Other performances are great as well, including Timothy Spall (the photographer) and especially Ken Watanabe.  The story is extremely well written and the action scenes are well done, with no extra choreography or special effects that make the action seem less authentic.  Finally, the score by Hans Zimmer.  It's easily my favorite thing about the film, and it's quite possibly the best soundtrack and score composed without being grandiose.  Zimmer uses many simplistic pieces that have two-note melodies but they're so poignant and fitting, that you can't not be moved by many scenes.

Farmers weren't allowed to leave their villages.  Samurai weren't allowed to go into business.  Until Perry came, foreigners were restricted access to one trading post.  While the backlash to Perry triggered a wave of ostrich-like denial of technology and the west, a very smart clique of leaders soon realized that the Japanese themselves had to take the lead in modernizing their country.  The samurai who didn't get it, would have made their country more vulnerable to the west by being more backward, if they had had their way.So the ending is completely wrong, if you are pro-Japanese.  Yes, they chafed under unequal trade treaties, but the future safety of the country was not to go backwards...and they didn't, so unlike China, the Japanese were able to recoup their sovereignty and engage the West on increasingly equal (and if you were Russian in 1905) superior footing.The ending is also completely wrong if you are pro-American.  The character played by Tom Cruise loathes his country as much as he loathes himself.  Americans were not saints during the 1860s or in any era, but there were plenty of heroes, and it's a tiresome choice to continue this stock theme of self-flagellation so rampant in movies like Dances with Wolves (which this story really rips off -- I'm sure that's how they pitched it -- ""its Dances with Wolves, but set in Japan"").I bet that the movie would have done much better if the Cruise character had been more noble in the U.S. and if the ending could have been about some kind of reconciliation, instead of the divisive travesty that they decided to show.At some point, one of the Hollywood studios is going to wake up and realize that Americans like to see positive, heroic portrayals from time to time instead of the diseased anti-heroes that they keep foisting on us, and whichever studio gets this will clean up at the box office.If you are into Japan see one of Kurosawa's films.  If you are into east-west stories, read Shogun or Tai-Pan.

If the ""I haven't figured out the right dose of Ritalin to take yet"" presence of Tom Cruise grates on your nerves as much as it does mine, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that he at times gives a measured and even subtle performance as a shell-shocked cavalry officer prostituting himself to teach the Japanese military the brutally efficient techniques of Western warfare.  His supporting cast of talented Asian actors is better, though even Ken Watanabe, who at times resembles Lawrence Fishburne in expression and intensity, is no Toshiro Mifune.  Where the movie breaks down is with John Logan's shallow script, which like most Western films about the East, implies complexity mostly by making Asians esoteric and tight-lipped; but for all of the posturing, there is no real wisdom offered in a story meant to explore culture clash.  Instead, viewers are distracted by battle scenes that probably would have seemed grand had the aforementioned films (with corrected titles), as well as ""Gladiator"" and ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" not beaten this one to the punch.  Zwick even plagiarizes his own film, the much better ""Glory,"" and fans of Hans Zimmer's ""The Thin Red Line"" soundtrack will be pleased to note that some of it seems to make its way into this film.  All in all, ""The Last Samurai"" isn't a bad film.

808405,A2YRDIRL316QJL,B0001JXOUS,Stephen M. Kerwick,"[3, 4]","To start off, this was a splendidly filmed movie with a fine sound track.  After that, I don't have much to say favorably.  I'm not an expert on early modern Japanese history, but as a journeyman I know enough to say with confidence that the story here is preposterous.  The Japanese looked to Germany (Prussia), not the US for army training.  Emporer Meiji, the greatest of their modern monarchs was a strong and decisive ruler (and wasn't referred to as Meiji until after his death, just as Hirohito is now referred to as Shoa).  The dramatizations and interplay of the characters, however, is what was really preposterous.  It may make for decent drama, but this is the sort of film that leads to typical American ignorance about foreign countries and their histories.

808407,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B0001JXOUS,Steve Douglas,"[13, 13]","I have loved this movie since it was first released and have the original DVD release which I have watched several times.  Most all the reviews I see here are either for the Standard DVD and focus on the great story line and acting but not the quality of the DVD itself.  Yes, Tom Cruse does shows some wonderful acting chops and, yes, Ken Watanabe steals the show but let's move on.  So this one will focus on the Blu-ray DVD's quality.Bought the Blu-ray version from Amazon and it was delivered post haste.  When I first looked at the back cover information I was disappointed that the audio was Dolby Digital 5.1 rather than a lossless DTSHD 5.1, almost thought of returning it before even watching but am glad I kept it.  The video quality of the movie is fairly pristine with no artifacting, good details in the shadows and a sparkling clear transfer.  While the audio quality is not the higher end DTSHD, never the less, the audio engineers did a fine job with the front and rear surrounds used subtly for action( actually, during the battle scenes, the rears deserved more discreet use of the rear channels) however, during the rainy scenes, of which there are many, the audio is evenly spread to all channels enveloping you in the rainstorm.The many extras on the single disc are from the 2004 standard release and there are only 2 deleted scenes that, to me, could have been included in an extended version.  I wish more extended deleted scenes had been included.  The supplied extras were all interesting and, as I said before, had seen them on the original release so nothing new on that front.Should you buy this on Blu-ray?  Yes, the video quality is definitely superior, however, not by that much.  The original release was pretty darn good. However, if you don't already have the Standard version, go for the Blu Ray.  I remain disappointed with the lossy audio but it still provides an excellent film.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,The Last Samurai-Blu-ray,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,2208,"['have', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'have', 'original', 'DVD', 'release', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'Most', 'reviews', 'see', 'here', 'are', 'Standard', 'DVD', 'focus', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'acting', 'not', 'quality', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'Tom', 'Cruse', 'shows', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'chops', 'yes', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'show', 'let', 'move', 'one', 'will', 'focus', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'quality.Bought', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'Amazon', 'was', 'delivered', 'post', 'haste', 'When', 'first', 'looked', 'back', 'cover', 'information', 'was', 'disappointed', 'audio', 'was', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'rather', 'lossless', 'DTSHD', '5.1', 'almost', 'thought', 'returning', 'even', 'watching', 'am', 'glad', 'kept', 'video', 'quality', 'movie', 'fairly', 'pristine', 'artifacting', 'good', 'details', 'shadows', 'sparkling', 'clear', 'transfer', 'audio', 'quality', 'not', 'higher', 'end', 'DTSHD', 'never', 'less', 'audio', 'engineers', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'front', 'rear', 'surrounds', 'used', 'subtly', 'action', 'actually', 'battle', 'scenes', 'rears', 'deserved', 'more', 'discreet', 'use', 'rear', 'channels', 'however', 'rainy', 'scenes', 'are', 'many', 'audio', 'evenly', 'spread', 'channels', 'enveloping', 'rainstorm.The', 'many', 'extras', 'single', 'disc', 'are', '2004', 'standard', 'release', 'are', 'only', '2', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'extended', 'version', 'wish', 'more', 'extended', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'supplied', 'extras', 'were', 'interesting', 'said', 'had', 'seen', 'original', 'release', 'so', 'nothing', 'new', 'front.Should', 'buy', 'Blu-ray', 'Yes', 'video', 'quality', 'definitely', 'superior', 'however', 'not', 'much', 'original', 'release', 'was', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'Standard', 'version', 'go', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'remain', 'disappointed', 'lossy', 'audio', 'still', 'excellent', 'film.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A
808408,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B0001JXOUS,Steve,"[0, 0]","Critics of The Last Samurai point out its obvious historically inaccuracies, the cheap ending, the tired plot already beaten to death before its predecessor Dances with Wolves stamped on the carcass, and the negative liberal view of the white man's legacy. All of these are valid points, but they lack support in light of the countless historical revisions filmed over the decades. One need only go back before the dawn of political correctness to see evidence of the contrary view of history; God-fearing white folk trying to scrape out a living on the frontier despite the devilish torment of the savage Injuns or white crusaders for Christ bringing salvation to the ignorant heathens beyond our shores. For the older among you who take exception to movies like The Last Samurai, Dances with Wolves, et al, I suggest you watch Birth of a Nation for some needed balance.Furthermore, this movie never claims to be based on facts, so criticizing it for failing to represent history is the weak tool of conservatives too blinded by their own belief that America can do no wrong. These narrow-minded fools are no better than their self-righteous America-bashing adversaries. Somewhere in the middle lies reality.The Last Samurai is an epic drama that focuses on the changes in a world, in a nation, and in a man. Troubled by his own violent past, Captain Algren (Tom Cruise in his limited, grinning, wide-eyed fashion) is the man who finds peace and forgiveness within himself through forced tenure among the Japanese in a Samurai village in 1876. The need for Cruise's character is debatable because the story of old ways coming to their end at the hands of dubious progress is worthy in and of itself, but this is a Hollywood movie and the movie never hides from its intended audience. The real treasure is in the sweeping scope of the cinematography, the insight to a way of life dramatically different from our own, powerful performances from the largely Japanese cast, an emotional score, and yes, the message, heavy-handed though it is.Hollywood and history make for strange bedfellows, be it Jesus Christ or the Roman Empire, Jesse James or Wyatt Earp, Hollywood never takes on a historical character or movement it can't bring sympathy to using self-indulgent poetic license. Were it not morally reprehensible, they'd probably manage to make a compassionate film about the Nazis....if they haven't already.There aren't a lot of great epic movies made because the balance between grandeur and excess or drama and action is perilous to maintain.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[5, 9]","If one had to assign a two-word description to Edward Zwick's ""The Last Samurai,"" it would not be ""dramatic film"" but rather ""pedestrian travelogue.""  Not only is the material derivative but the entire production is devoid of energy and conviction.Civil War veteran Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is asked to travel to Japan to help modernize the Emperor's army.  He is told the army will be used to hunt down a renegade samurai named Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) who is challenging the government's authority.  Algren does his job despite misgivings over having to work again with his former commander, Colonel Benjamin Bagly (Tony Goldwyn).  However, matters change after he is captured by Katsumoto.  While being held in captivity, Algren immerses himself in the teachings of the samurai and starts to understand the way of life that Katsumoto is trying so hard to preserve.""The Last Samurai"" is filled with gorgeous scenery but that is about all it has going for it.  Its story is an awkward mishmash of ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990) and ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969).  In fact, Algren and Katsumto's final battle charge is so reminiscent of the latter film that you are actually searching the screen to see if William Holden is in the scene somewhere.  The production design is superb and Cruise, Watanabe, Goldwyn, along with Koyuki, Timothy Spall, and Billy Connolly do good work in their roles.  Yet, the film as a whole fails because the directing is languid and the writing is just too simplistic.  Undoubtedly, the talent behind ""The Last Samurai"" had high hopes for their project but unfortunately all the pieces of their creative venture just did not come together.",2,"""You believe a man can change his destiny?""",1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,1662,"['one', 'had', 'assign', 'two-word', 'description', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'dramatic', 'film', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'travelogue', 'Not', 'only', 'material', 'derivative', 'entire', 'production', 'devoid', 'energy', 'conviction.Civil', 'War', 'veteran', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'asked', 'travel', 'Japan', 'help', 'modernize', 'Emperor', 'army', 'told', 'army', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'hunt', 'down', 'renegade', 'samurai', 'named', 'Katsumoto', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'who', 'challenging', 'government', 'authority', 'Algren', 'job', 'misgivings', 'having', 'work', 'again', 'former', 'commander', 'Colonel', 'Benjamin', 'Bagly', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'However', 'matters', 'change', 'captured', 'Katsumoto', 'being', 'held', 'captivity', 'Algren', 'teachings', 'samurai', 'understand', 'way', 'life', 'Katsumoto', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'preserve', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'filled', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'going', 'story', 'awkward', 'mishmash', 'Dances', 'Wolves', '1990', 'Wild', 'Bunch', '1969', 'fact', 'Algren', 'Katsumto', 'final', 'battle', 'charge', 'so', 'reminiscent', 'latter', 'film', 'are', 'actually', 'searching', 'screen', 'see', 'William', 'Holden', 'scene', 'somewhere', 'production', 'design', 'superb', 'Cruise', 'Watanabe', 'Goldwyn', 'Koyuki', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'do', 'good', 'work', 'roles', 'film', 'whole', 'directing', 'languid', 'writing', 'just', 'too', 'simplistic', 'Undoubtedly', 'talent', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'project', 'unfortunately', 'pieces', 'creative', 'venture', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'together']",N/A

It's a Japanese 'Dancing With Wolves', without the originality, dialogue or artistic vision.The basic theme here is shallow and historically ill-conceived.  In the 1850's Admiral Perry's expedition brought enormous change and the downfall of the traditional Samurai caste system of the Edo period. But the old system was very cruel and arbitrary, and had outlived it's usefulness.Watanabe's Feudal lord is charming and complex, but ultimately he's an anti-tech Luddite.  His position was xenophobic and short-sighted.  In one sad scene, a young samurai is forcibly arrested & has his hair cut and his sword confiscated..  It's heartbreaking, unless you know that the sword represented the samurai's traditional right to kill commoners with impunity.  That was their ancient birthright - hardly something most Americans would defend.Another part: The highest ideal in Bushido was loyalty and Death before Surrender. This honor-code and Monarchy-worship would continue, and years later would grow into the proto-Nazi claptrap which lead to expansion before WWII, vast numbers of unecessary suicides during the war to avoid surrender, kamakazees, etc.  It is a philosophy with no flexibility or humanity, and is now thankfully extinct in the modern Japanese mainsteam.Celebrating these ideas here feels unhealthy, and Tom Cruise's 'going native' into that Samurai version of Shangri La did not impress me either as a spiritual journey or as a safe and practical idea.We were supposed to root for the guys going into battle against Gatling guns with swords.. These guys were Dodo birds fighting the dogs.  They never had a chance, and their certain demise was not very entertaining or uplifting - it felt more like the unfolding of a preventable tragedy.I also didn't understand the implicit veneration of the Emperor that is meant to be shared by the audience.  Americans don't agree with this worldview, although they might have bowed to the Emperor out of protocol and custom at the time.In the end, the emperor shows some remorse and changes his mind.. whoopie.

Mirsky ""swm""","[3, 6]","I was surprised that I actually liked this one, particularly since it seemed to promise just another run-of-the-mill action/adventure period piece. Of course I happen to be partial to these kinds of stories and I have a great fondness for the Japanese variants of same. Still I didn't expect to enjoy this hybrid eastern-western that reworked Japanese history in order to put a dissolute and despondent American war hero (who's tortured by what he did in the Indian wars that followed on the Civil War) into the era of Japanese modernization. Tom Cruise always seems to me to be too cuddly to play such roles and yet I thought he pulled this one off. The story held together and was absorbing if somewhat predictable while Cruise actually proved to be a somewhat convincing American dissolute. That he takes to the Samurai lifestyle and weapons handling practices so readily is a bit hard to believe though the film does a good job of dragging out the learning process enough so that it doesn't look too precipitous. Of course, the American is only with his captors for a few months so it's a little hard to accept that he manages to become expert in Japanese swordsmanship in so short a span. But the film makes it look convincing and that's usually enough in this kind of thing. The battle scenes are also nicely done and the Samurai lord, Katsuomoto, who captures and ultimately befriends the American Algren is powerfully portrayed. Although there was little that was unexpected, Katsoumoto's escape from his enemies at the emperor's court was probably the high point and the least predictable in the film's repertoire of scenes.

Whether intended or not by it's producers, this film supplies a resounding defense of time-honored traditions (conservatism), and critiques progressive reforms not founded in morality or tested by experience. The Japanese military men who hire Cruise to wage modern warfare against the Samurai, are driven by ideology - the belief that Japan must embrace Western modernism to survive in the modern world. This ideological drive typifies liberals everywhere, who dream up solutions to America's problem in faculty lounges, utterly detached from the real world.

808416,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B0001JXOUS,Takis Tz.,"[3, 6]","Being that this film is based on actual historical occurences it could've been the typical Hollywood silliness extraordinaire complete with massive innacuracies, tons of cheese and syrup, and a dishwashed script.Incredibly, most of the above was avoided with the exception maybe of the historical innacuracies but even those coul've been severe and they weren't.As the plot has been detailed by other reviewers I'll stick to the impression this film leaves you with. The ""Last Samurai"" is actually a pretty cool flick. The theme (encountered in other older films as well) of the westerner who goes over to Asia with the mindset of a clueless brute only to be engulfed by the age-old philosophy he comes in contact with there is well in effect here and it works like a dandy.Cruise gives his usual very good performance but the show is actually stolen by the Japanese cast headed by the ""Katsumoto"" character (the Samurai leader) who's simply a treat to watch.There is loads of battling in vast open fields and a lot of gore that accompanies it, and these escenes are absolutely great. The martian arts choreography is excellent and the filming is impeccable as well.But what makes the film really tick are the sequences where after Cruise has been captured by the Samurai he has long and intriguing conversations with Katsumoto while at the same time he's trying to come to grips with a culture he not only doesnt understand but which charms him to death. These sequences are the top stuff this film has to offer and it does so with style.While the Last Samurai does remind of the Lord of the Rings when it comes to the spectacular battle scene and it equally reminds of Braveheart with the super-underdogs taking on bravely the hordes of mechanised soldiers sent by the emperor to crush their rebellion it still maintains a life and heart of its own and keeps you hooked till the end which is (sadly)predictable, conventional and somewhat corny.That, along with the fact that it is probably 20 minutes too long are the only minuses i could attribute to it. Sure, this is Hollywood spreading cliches again, as the Samurai werent as noble as they are usually portrayed since they mindlessly accepted any order coming from the emperor and that included massacring ""opponents"" at his order regardless of guilt or innocence. But this type of cliche was to be expected.Overall though, this is a probably unexpectedly cool film. Definately recommended, allthough if you see it on a small screen you'll be inevitably missing out on the great photography and camera work, but most importantly the stunning combat scenes, many of which are shot aereally.",4,Lord of the Rings meets Braveheart but not only...,1081296000,"04 7, 2004",2004,2645,"['Being', 'film', 'based', 'actual', 'historical', 'occurences', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'silliness', 'extraordinaire', 'complete', 'massive', 'innacuracies', 'tons', 'cheese', 'syrup', 'dishwashed', 'script.Incredibly', 'most', 'above', 'was', 'avoided', 'exception', 'maybe', 'historical', 'innacuracies', 'even', 'coul', ""'ve"", 'been', 'severe', ""weren't.As"", 'plot', 'been', 'detailed', 'other', 'reviewers', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'impression', 'film', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'actually', 'pretty', 'cool', 'flick', 'theme', 'encountered', 'other', 'older', 'films', 'well', 'westerner', 'who', 'Asia', 'mindset', 'clueless', 'brute', 'only', 'be', 'engulfed', 'age-old', 'philosophy', 'contact', 'well', 'effect', 'here', 'dandy.Cruise', 'usual', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'show', 'actually', 'stolen', 'Japanese', 'cast', 'headed', 'Katsumoto', 'character', 'Samurai', 'leader', 'who', 'simply', 'treat', 'watch.There', 'loads', 'battling', 'vast', 'open', 'fields', 'lot', 'gore', 'escenes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'great', 'martian', 'arts', 'choreography', 'excellent', 'filming', 'impeccable', 'well.But', 'film', 'really', 'are', 'sequences', 'where', 'Cruise', 'been', 'captured', 'Samurai', 'long', 'intriguing', 'conversations', 'Katsumoto', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'culture', 'not', 'only', 'doesnt', 'understand', 'death', 'sequences', 'are', 'top', 'stuff', 'film', 'offer', 'so', 'style.While', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'remind', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'when', 'spectacular', 'battle', 'scene', 'equally', 'Braveheart', 'super-underdogs', 'taking', 'bravely', 'hordes', 'mechanised', 'soldiers', 'sent', 'emperor', 'crush', 'rebellion', 'still', 'life', 'heart', 'own', 'hooked', 'till', 'end', 'sadly', 'predictable', 'conventional', 'somewhat', 'corny.That', 'fact', 'probably', '20', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'are', 'only', 'minuses', 'i', 'could', 'attribute', 'Sure', 'Hollywood', 'spreading', 'cliches', 'again', 'Samurai', 'werent', 'as', 'noble', 'are', 'usually', 'portrayed', 'mindlessly', 'accepted', 'order', 'coming', 'emperor', 'included', 'massacring', 'opponents', 'order', 'regardless', 'guilt', 'innocence', 'type', 'cliche', 'was', 'be', 'expected.Overall', 'probably', 'unexpectedly', 'cool', 'film', 'Definately', 'recommended', 'see', 'small', 'screen', ""'ll"", 'be', 'inevitably', 'missing', 'out', 'great', 'photography', 'camera', 'work', 'most', 'importantly', 'stunning', 'combat', 'scenes', 'many', 'are', 'shot', 'aereally']",N/A

Why love?? Could she not simply have respected him for his steadfast efforts toward reconciliation and his willingness to turn against his own countrymen on her (and her people's) behalf? When otherwise credible story lines start creating unlikely plot twists, especially near the conclusion of the movie, it is time to prepare for that most dreaded of all literary constructions: the ""Hollywood ending"".Which brings up my second point: I felt that the obviously ""tacked on"" (but predictable...see point one) ""happy ending"" was an insult to all events which preceded it. Out of the ENTIRE Samurai army, guess the identity of the single survivor of the this epic and heroic ""battle to the death"". Tell me this doesn't strain credibility beyond the breaking point. That the (heretofore gutless) Japanese emperor suddenly develops a spine and does the ""right thing"" when confronted by this (unnamed) survivor only further accentuates the absurdity of it all. It is a slap in the face.The ending was a cop out, and the movie would have been infinitely better if it had ended about 15 minutes sooner, on the battlefield and in a much more final and plausible way. I guess the title would have to be altered, but this might not be a bad thing due to the ambiguity about to whom it refers.I still recommend this movie for all of the substantial and compelling positive reasons cited above, but see if you don't share, or at least acknowledge, the basis for my criticism after you have watched it.",4,Great movie....let down by a cheesy Hollywood ending !!!,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,1930,"['little', 'criticize', 'vast', 'majority', 'extravaganza', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'spectacular', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'first', 'rate', '.BUT', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'two', 'factors.First', 'very', 'difficult', 'believe', 'Japanese', 'widow', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'coarse', 'smelly', 'worst', 'foreign', 'soldier', 'who', 'had', 'killed', 'husband', 'Why', 'love', 'Could', 'not', 'simply', 'have', 'respected', 'steadfast', 'efforts', 'reconciliation', 'willingness', 'turn', 'own', 'countrymen', 'people', 'behalf', 'When', 'otherwise', 'credible', 'story', 'lines', 'start', 'creating', 'unlikely', 'plot', 'twists', 'especially', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'time', 'prepare', 'most', 'dreaded', 'literary', 'constructions', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'up', 'second', 'point', 'felt', 'obviously', 'tacked', 'predictable', 'see', 'point', 'one', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', 'insult', 'events', 'preceded', 'ENTIRE', 'Samurai', 'army', 'guess', 'identity', 'single', 'survivor', 'epic', 'heroic', 'battle', 'death', 'Tell', ""n't"", 'strain', 'credibility', 'breaking', 'point', 'heretofore', 'gutless', 'Japanese', 'emperor', 'suddenly', 'spine', 'right', 'thing', 'when', 'confronted', 'unnamed', 'survivor', 'only', 'further', 'absurdity', 'slap', 'face.The', 'ending', 'was', 'cop', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'infinitely', 'better', 'had', 'ended', 'about', '15', 'minutes', 'sooner', 'battlefield', 'much', 'more', 'final', 'plausible', 'way', 'guess', 'title', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'altered', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'due', 'ambiguity', 'whom', 'still', 'recommend', 'movie', 'substantial', 'compelling', 'positive', 'reasons', 'cited', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'least', 'acknowledge', 'basis', 'criticism', 'have', 'watched']",N/A

This movie tries very hard to engage you and play on your emotions. So we get lots of overdone acting, slow mode sequencies, close-ups, and favored characters with stony glares and a tear dripping down their cheek. Tom Cruise maintained one facial expression throughout the film, failing to communicate his character's feelings and thus failing to make a connection with the audience. The other actors overcompensated for him, delivering plenty of open mouthed, wide eyed stares, specifically Koyuki, Cruise's love interest. While she was very beautiful and graceful, her acting was very soap operaish. Besides which, their connection was strange - both fell for each other, but with little reason and almost no chemistry. The battle scenes were gruesome but, unlike Saving Private Ryan or Schindlers List, failed to show the point or move emotions. The impossibility amidst such a serious attitude also didn't help the movie. That Cruise could learn, no, MASTER the Samurai way so quickly as to be able to defeat ninjas and be the SOLE SURVIVOR against an army of thousands(who used guns while Cruise stuck with his sword) was ridiculous. Of course, all the ""bad guys"" can't shoot a gun if their opponent is standing two feet in front of them with a target over there heart, but the ""good guys"" can shoot arrows up into the air without looking and pierce their enemy right through the eye. When the movie wasn't irrational or overdone, it often became tedious. Mainly, it lacked a real focus. First, we think its about Cruise's past, as he has many flashbacks, but this is only briefly addressed. Then, we think its about Cruise and his captain/opponent, who does gets his just desserts but only in passing. Once we meet the lovely and FORGIVING widow, we're sure its a sparkling romance, but it never truly blossoms. And we're, of course, waiting for Cruise to become a samurai, but he doesn't officially. While lose ends are tied up, the task is done as a task - it gets the job done but with little zing. The actors tried. The director tried. The writers tried. And their effort makes a watchable movie (thus the two stars).

It is a world that was slowly dying out as more and more Japanese people turned to living in the Western traditions, and for one US Military Captain, it showed him a world he grew to respect and love.....Tom Cruise stars as Nathan Algren, a captain sent to the foreign land of Japan to teach Japanese soldiers the way to fight as US troops do in America. The preparation is needed to stop a rebellion of Samurai warriors led by Katsumoto [played by Ken Watanabe] who have been attacking railroads and supply trains.After being sent to the front lines with troops he believes aren't ready to fight yet, Algren is captured after a battle and is brought to the village of Katsumoto's brother in the mountains. Despite some harsh attempts of getting used to the lifestyle of the Samurai, Algren slowly but surely learns how to love the Samurai lifestyle and how they work day and night.The movie shows us breath taking landscape shots of the mountains the Samurai live in. It even shows some great rain storm scenes as Algren attempts to prove himself by battling in a swordfight with one of the experienced Samurai and refuses to stay down no matter how many times he is knocked down.This movie also comes with some great fighting style scenes. With the fog war near the beginning in which Algren is captured after his inexperience troops are cut down by the Samurai, to a Ninja attack on the Samurai village where the samurai sacrifice themselves to save Katsumoto, to even Algren siding with Katsumoto for the climactic battle in the end against his fellow officers.This movie is great in so many ways: The vibrant color of the scenery, the style of fighting is smooth yet terrifying as lots of men die, and even the dialogue between Algren and Katsumoto is great as they have their ""Many Conversations.""I reccomend this movie if you really want to see a story of a man who realizes what he really wants for himself in this world.........",4,The Way of the Warrior.....,1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,2055,"['Last', 'Samurai', 'viewer', 'look', 'lifestyle', 'ancient', 'ways', 'Samurai', '1800', 'world', 'was', 'slowly', 'dying', 'out', 'more', 'more', 'Japanese', 'people', 'turned', 'living', 'Western', 'traditions', 'one', 'US', 'Military', 'Captain', 'showed', 'world', 'grew', 'respect', 'love', '..Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nathan', 'Algren', 'captain', 'sent', 'foreign', 'land', 'Japan', 'teach', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'way', 'fight', 'US', 'troops', 'do', 'America', 'preparation', 'needed', 'stop', 'rebellion', 'Samurai', 'warriors', 'led', 'Katsumoto', '[', 'played', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', ']', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'attacking', 'railroads', 'supply', 'trains.After', 'being', 'sent', 'front', 'lines', 'troops', 'are', ""n't"", 'ready', 'fight', 'yet', 'Algren', 'captured', 'battle', 'brought', 'village', 'Katsumoto', 'brother', 'mountains', 'harsh', 'attempts', 'getting', 'used', 'lifestyle', 'Samurai', 'Algren', 'slowly', 'surely', 'how', 'love', 'Samurai', 'lifestyle', 'how', 'work', 'day', 'night.The', 'movie', 'taking', 'landscape', 'shots', 'mountains', 'Samurai', 'live', 'even', 'great', 'rain', 'storm', 'scenes', 'Algren', 'prove', 'battling', 'swordfight', 'one', 'experienced', 'Samurai', 'stay', 'down', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'knocked', 'down.This', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'fighting', 'style', 'scenes', 'fog', 'war', 'beginning', 'Algren', 'captured', 'inexperience', 'troops', 'are', 'cut', 'down', 'Samurai', 'Ninja', 'attack', 'Samurai', 'village', 'where', 'samurai', 'sacrifice', 'save', 'Katsumoto', 'even', 'Algren', 'siding', 'Katsumoto', 'climactic', 'battle', 'end', 'fellow', 'officers.This', 'movie', 'great', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'vibrant', 'color', 'scenery', 'style', 'fighting', 'smooth', 'yet', 'terrifying', 'lots', 'men', 'die', 'even', 'dialogue', 'Algren', 'Katsumoto', 'great', 'have', 'Many', 'Conversations', 'reccomend', 'movie', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'what', 'really', 'world']",N/A

""The Last Samurai"" shows the way of life and precious traditional culture of the Japanese. Examples of interesting cultural scenes are the art of making green tea, which is complicated and formal, the practice of caligraphy, and the making of poetries.More importantly, the movie portrays the code of values for the honorable Samurai. Through the flow of the movie, values such as honor, perseverance and dignity are depicted. Unfortunately, these values of which the Samurai had lived and died for are threatened by progress.In ""The Last Samurai,"" the actors, both Asians and Westerners, did a wonderful job. However, I believe the best actor is Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto). He represented the undying determinacy of the Samurai well. He even is nominated for the best supporting actor of the Academy Awards! As for Tom Cruise (Captain Nathen Algren), who was accepted into the Samurai clan of Katsumoto (some audience believe as a Samurai because he wore the traditional armor of Samurai when he went to battle against his own kin), was a pretty good actor too, he speaks Japanese well.However, I discovered a racist scene in the movie. At the end of the film, as can be predicted by the title, the last generation of the Samurai entered immortality. And ironicaly, the ""last Samurai"" is Tom Cruise, an American.In this movie, the existance of the struggling traditional Japanese society is threatened by the future of advancement and technology in downtown Japan.

However, the story is downright twisted and innacurate. In real life, the Samurai were the BAD GUYS. They were arrogant and stuck up, and they were disgruntled because they were loosing their political status with the unification of Japan. The Japanese soldiers were brave, and fought valiantly and proved their worth against the Samurai in battle, and they won. The Samurai thought since they were &quot;lowly peasants&quot; they would be defeated without a struggle, but they were wrong. However, this movie completely twists around what really happened. The Samurai are portrayed as brave, moral men who want to preserve the Japanese culture and prevent &quot;westernization&quot; (which obviousely is something the director does not like), and the Japanese army is portrayed as cowardly weaklings, who the Samurai slaughter like Orcs from the Lord of the Rings. And for what? The Samurai openly admit that westernization and the extinction of Bushido is un-avoidable, so why do they see the need for a completely wasteful bloodbath that ends in hundreds of soldiers and Samurai dead?

This doesn't matter in movies like ZATOICHI, which are definitely tongue-in-cheek, but in something more serious like TLS it matters.So I found myself pleasantly surprised that not only did I not mind Tom Cruise so much (after the first 15 minutes or so, where he overdoes the 'Tom Cruise' bits) and the sword work (bokken and shinken) was handled with an acceptable degree of authenticity. The movie also paid suitable homage to the Samurai, who on one hand carried with them the whole baggage of a feudal repressive culture, but who also embodied much of what one might call the 'spirit of Japan'. It's an ambiguous situation, where nothing's all good or bad, but when it ends like it did end there's a lot of pathos and sadness, no matter WHAT the merits or not.This was well-handled and the movie made a real impact - on this reviewer anyway.Till NoeverAuthor: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIPowlglass.com",4,surprisingly good,1093219200,"08 23, 2004",2004,1104,"[""'m"", 'not', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'fan', 'Actually', 'opposite', 'true', 'Also', 'knowing', 'something', 'Samurai', 'Samurai', 'swordcraft', 'automatically', 'zoom', 'flaws', 'inconsistencies', 'areas', ""n't"", 'matter', 'movies', 'ZATOICHI', 'are', 'definitely', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'something', 'more', 'serious', 'TLS', 'matters.So', 'found', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'not', 'mind', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'so', 'much', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'where', ""'Tom"", 'Cruise', 'bits', 'sword', 'work', 'bokken', 'shinken', 'was', 'handled', 'acceptable', 'degree', 'authenticity', 'movie', 'also', 'paid', 'suitable', 'homage', 'Samurai', 'who', 'one', 'hand', 'carried', 'whole', 'baggage', 'feudal', 'repressive', 'culture', 'who', 'also', 'embodied', 'much', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'call', ""'spirit"", 'Japan', 'ambiguous', 'situation', 'where', 'nothing', 'good', 'bad', 'when', 'did', 'end', 'lot', 'pathos', 'sadness', 'matter', 'WHAT', 'merits', 'not.This', 'was', 'well-handled', 'movie', 'made', 'real', 'impact', 'reviewer', 'anyway.Till', 'NoeverAuthor', 'KEAEN', 'SELADIENNA', 'CONTINUITY', 'SLIPowlglass.com']",N/A

For hundreds of years the country was ruled by a prime minister who had the title of Shogun. His rule was backed by a feudal system of armed nobles who had retinues of hereditory warriors called samurai. Samurai were of noble birth and trained in both warrior skills and an ideology of warfare.The 19th Century saw the Emperor of Japan sieze power from the Shogun and to end the feudal system creating a conscript army and a modern navy. To do this he imported overseas advisors, Prussians to train the army British and French to help with the navy. The change to the power structure lead to a revolt of the samurai class upset at the loss of their traditional privalages. This film is about this revolt.Being an American film the action is seen through the prism of an American officer. This of course is the first point at which we move into the land of fairy tale. At the time of the events of this film America had a small army of no great reputation. However probably Tom Cruise does a poor German accent.Rather than being a drama about what happened the film is about the Tom Cruise character. That is a person who has had his soul destroyed as he has been part of a massacre of Indian women and children. This has turned him into an alcoholic who is drifting through life. In this film he is redeemed.He is captured by the samurai in a battle and then kept prisoner in a remote village for the winter. In his time he becomes a convert to the samurai life style and decides to switch sides in the last epic pointless battle to keep the feudal system going in Japan. In this way he redeams himself and heal the pain of the massacre. He is also able to kill the American officer who commanded him to kill the native Americans.The film is gratutously insluting to important figures in Japanese history. The emperor Meiji who was responsible for modernising his country is portrayed instead as a figure of self confidence and vision, as a dithering boy who needs Tom Cruise to help him discover the true values of his country. Cruise in talking to his feudal buddies the Samurai immediately takes on a leadership role planning the last idiotic battle and gives them tiresome lectures about the wars between the Greeks and the Persians.The film is not only laboured and tiresome it is reflective of American hubris and is unhistoric in putting them at the centre of events they had no part in.",1,Awful,1080777600,"04 1, 2004",2004,2446,"['19th', 'Century', 'Japan', 'became', 'part', 'world', 'hundreds', 'years', 'country', 'was', 'ruled', 'prime', 'minister', 'who', 'had', 'title', 'Shogun', 'rule', 'was', 'backed', 'feudal', 'system', 'armed', 'nobles', 'who', 'had', 'retinues', 'hereditory', 'warriors', 'called', 'samurai', 'Samurai', 'were', 'noble', 'birth', 'trained', 'warrior', 'skills', 'ideology', '19th', 'Century', 'saw', 'Emperor', 'Japan', 'sieze', 'power', 'Shogun', 'end', 'feudal', 'system', 'creating', 'conscript', 'army', 'modern', 'navy', 'do', 'imported', 'overseas', 'advisors', 'Prussians', 'train', 'army', 'British', 'French', 'help', 'navy', 'change', 'power', 'structure', 'lead', 'revolt', 'samurai', 'class', 'upset', 'loss', 'traditional', 'privalages', 'film', 'revolt.Being', 'American', 'film', 'action', 'seen', 'prism', 'American', 'officer', 'course', 'first', 'point', 'move', 'land', 'fairy', 'tale', 'time', 'events', 'film', 'America', 'had', 'small', 'army', 'great', 'reputation', 'However', 'probably', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'poor', 'German', 'accent.Rather', 'being', 'drama', 'what', 'happened', 'film', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'soul', 'destroyed', 'been', 'part', 'massacre', 'Indian', 'women', 'children', 'turned', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'drifting', 'life', 'film', 'redeemed.He', 'captured', 'samurai', 'battle', 'then', 'kept', 'prisoner', 'remote', 'village', 'winter', 'time', 'convert', 'samurai', 'life', 'style', 'switch', 'sides', 'last', 'epic', 'pointless', 'battle', 'keep', 'feudal', 'system', 'going', 'Japan', 'way', 'heal', 'pain', 'massacre', 'also', 'able', 'kill', 'American', 'officer', 'who', 'commanded', 'kill', 'native', 'Americans.The', 'film', 'gratutously', 'insluting', 'important', 'figures', 'Japanese', 'history', 'emperor', 'Meiji', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'modernising', 'country', 'portrayed', 'instead', 'figure', 'self', 'confidence', 'vision', 'dithering', 'boy', 'who', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'help', 'discover', 'true', 'values', 'country', 'Cruise', 'talking', 'feudal', 'Samurai', 'immediately', 'leadership', 'role', 'planning', 'last', 'idiotic', 'battle', 'tiresome', 'lectures', 'wars', 'Greeks', 'Persians.The', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'laboured', 'tiresome', 'reflective', 'American', 'hubris', 'unhistoric', 'putting', 'centre', 'events', 'had', 'part']",N/A

Those expecting something along the line of ""Braveheart"" be warned. Tom Cruise is enjoyable, but he gives his standard performance. Which is to say that you do not see a character like he is capable of giving, such as Ron Kovic in ""Born on the 4th of July"" or even Lestat in ""Interview with the Vampire."" Instead you get Tom Cruise as an angst-ridden, recovering alcoholic that looks great in a kimono. But the performance still works, it's just shame about the missed potential.Ken Watanabe is very charismatic as the traditionalist-turned-outlaw who tries to hold on to the outdated beliefs of the samurai. The chemistry between he and Cruise is very good and it's one of the more pleasurable aspects of the film. As well as the much too short screen time of Billy Conelly and Tony Goldwyn. The cinematography and the costumes are also great and are bound to get oscar nominations.Unfortunately this film buys into it's own granduer, and it falls short on that level. There are some great moments in the film, don't get me wrong. Edward Zwick proves he can still crank out a battle scene and he clearly outdoes himself in the last battle of the film. Even when you know what the outcome will be. But that's where the film should have ended. Instead you get another ten minutes of an eye rolling, very sappy resolution. I'm not sure if this was the product of Zwick or the suits at WB, but does not work.Another scene I found difficult to swallow was an assassination attempt. Great fight choreography, great action, but awkwardly placed and no justification for it. You can almost hear a studio exec say ""This is Japan. So where are the ninjas?"" If the gunpowder obsessed emperor and cronies sent the assassins, (which is whom you assume sent them) why did they use ninjas instead of rifleman? Thereby proving the effectiveness of rifle over swords. It's because it makes for a great action scene, that's why, and the audience will eat it up.The film is good and I recommend it.

Personally, I avoided this movie for quite a while because of Cruise in the leading role.  To my surprise-his performance was credible--though there are a few absurd moments-such as an early battle scene where Cruise is fighting off a half dozen or so Samurai single handed (though he does get wounded)  As someone who's lived in Japam twice--I was also amazed by how easily Cruise's character picked up Japanese!Nit picking aside-I enjoyed this movie--except for the ending which was about as lame as anything imaginable.  IMO--this movie would have been better if it had ended with the climatic scene at the end of the Samurai attack--where it appears all the Samurai are dead or dying--Cruise included.  If it had ended here-I would have rated the move 4 stars--but the ""epilogue"" was a disaster!

The Academy missed its important message and passed on an excellent acting performance by Tom Cruise.Filmed in New Zealand it takes on the persona of 19th century Japan. The villages and costumes are so authentic that you are transported back into a beautiful time, with lush vegetation and a purity of living. The film is soothing and spiritual despite the battle scenes.Tom Cruise plays a civil war captain who has lost his integrity after fighting and killing Indians alongside of General Custer. He becomes a drunk wallowing in drink rather than deal with the guilt and trauma of war. A Shogun, working for the Emperor of Japan, employs his expertise in war to train the Imperial Army. During this time in history the Emperor was trying to modernize Japan and defeat the control that the Samurai had over his land. Because of the heartfelt beliefs of the Samurai's they rejected a modern Japan feeling as though a &quot;western&quot; culture would bring too much distance from true integrity. After watching this movie you may think differently about the enforcement of democracy on a culture steeped in ancient values.The battle scenes are epic and real, extreme attention is given to each and every detail. The warrior costumes appear historically accurate and a tribute to the Samurai culture. Cruise is captured in battle by the Samurai and eventually adapts to the culture that heals his integrity again. The sword fighting scenes are flawless and powerful. His adaption into this ancient society is impressively spiritual and he gains his belief in himself through code of the Samurai: Honesty &amp; Justice, Duty &amp; Loyality, Polite Courtesy, Compassion, Complete Sincerity, Heroic Courage and Honor. We could all use such healing.Although Samurai's have a place in history as brutal warriors and warlords this movie will give new meaning to their way of life. Is a true warrior someone who bombs individuals without looking his enemy in the eye or is honor to be found only through the way of the Samurai? It is an interesting concept to debate. Sometimes simplicity is the only honorable choice and quite possibly wars should only be fought by the code of these honorable men.",5,A Masterpiece of Wisdom,1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,2264,"['movie', 'exquisite', 'masterpiece', 'cinematography', 'direction', 'Academy', 'missed', 'important', 'message', 'passed', 'excellent', 'acting', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Cruise.Filmed', 'New', 'Zealand', 'persona', '19th', 'century', 'Japan', 'villages', 'costumes', 'are', 'so', 'authentic', 'are', 'transported', 'back', 'beautiful', 'time', 'lush', 'vegetation', 'purity', 'living', 'film', 'soothing', 'spiritual', 'battle', 'scenes.Tom', 'Cruise', 'civil', 'war', 'captain', 'who', 'lost', 'integrity', 'fighting', 'killing', 'Indians', 'alongside', 'General', 'Custer', 'drunk', 'wallowing', 'drink', 'rather', 'deal', 'guilt', 'trauma', 'war', 'Shogun', 'working', 'Emperor', 'Japan', 'expertise', 'war', 'train', 'Imperial', 'Army', 'time', 'history', 'Emperor', 'was', 'trying', 'modernize', 'Japan', 'defeat', 'control', 'Samurai', 'had', 'land', 'heartfelt', 'beliefs', 'Samurai', 'rejected', 'modern', 'Japan', 'feeling', 'quot', 'western', 'quot', 'culture', 'would', 'bring', 'too', 'much', 'distance', 'true', 'integrity', 'watching', 'movie', 'may', 'think', 'differently', 'enforcement', 'democracy', 'culture', 'steeped', 'ancient', 'values.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'epic', 'real', 'extreme', 'attention', 'given', 'detail', 'warrior', 'costumes', 'appear', 'historically', 'accurate', 'tribute', 'Samurai', 'culture', 'Cruise', 'captured', 'battle', 'Samurai', 'eventually', 'adapts', 'culture', 'integrity', 'again', 'sword', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'flawless', 'powerful', 'adaption', 'ancient', 'society', 'impressively', 'spiritual', 'gains', 'belief', 'code', 'Samurai', 'Honesty', 'amp', 'Justice', 'Duty', 'amp', 'Loyality', 'Polite', 'Courtesy', 'Compassion', 'Complete', 'Sincerity', 'Heroic', 'Courage', 'Honor', 'could', 'all', 'use', 'such', 'Samurai', 'have', 'place', 'history', 'brutal', 'warriors', 'warlords', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'new', 'meaning', 'way', 'life', 'true', 'warrior', 'someone', 'who', 'bombs', 'individuals', 'looking', 'enemy', 'eye', 'honor', 'be', 'found', 'only', 'way', 'Samurai', 'interesting', 'concept', 'debate', 'Sometimes', 'simplicity', 'only', 'honorable', 'choice', 'quite', 'possibly', 'wars', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'fought', 'code', 'honorable', 'men']",N/A

There are so many things in this movie that suck me in, that I just love watching this over and over again.The depiction of Japan during the start of their industrialization.The bad ass Samurai that charge into battle knowing the outcome.The beautiful sound track that sucks you into the world and makes you want to visit this idyllic Japan.The meeting of enemies who come to understand one another.and the absolutely epic final battle that makes me cry every, freaking, time.Some might complain that the movie is slow and that a lot doesn't happen. Yeah, I can see why they would say that. But honestly, there's a reason for it. Unlike most movies, this film gives you the opportunity to actually grow and care for the characters. It let's you be a foreigner in a strange land and shows you their culture, their way of life, their values.It shows you that your enemies don't always necessarily have to be your enemies.

It addresses the Japanese culture with knowledge and respect. It brings to life one of the defining moments of Japanese history, possibly the one moment that marks the start of modern era.

The story is generally engrossing and it's great to envision how the Samurai may have really lived in Japan hundreds of years ago. Speaking of which, the costumes and sets are outstanding, no doubt about it.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: I enjoyed the movie, I did, but the plot is obviously taken from ""Dances With Wolves,"" a very superior film. One could also cite ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Last of the Dogmen"" as films with similar plots. (Although ""Dogmen"" is basically a rip-off of ""Dances With Wolves,"" the story takes place in the modern world, so it definitely possesses its own uniqueness). The scene in ""Samurai"" where the Samurai make their first dramatic appearance is obviously ripped-off straight from a similar scene in ""Dogmen"" wherein the Indians make their first appearance (compare the two scenes for verification).The score in the film is certainly serviceable but parts of it painfully sound like a watered-down variation of the fabulous score from ""The Last of the Mohicans.""BOTTOM LINE: Although ""The Last Samurai"" could be subtitled ""Dances with the Last Dogmen of Arabia,"" it's still quite enjoyable.

808470,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B0001JXOUS,Zack Davisson,"[11, 12]","""The Last Samurai"" is an excellent film, respectful of its source material even while telling a fictional story.  The ""foreigner joins a warrior culture, taking on their strange dress and winning their respect"" story is well-represented on film and in history, from Bonnie Prince Charlie to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Dances with Wolves,"" as well as the Japanese-themed ""Shogun,"" which is based on the life of Miura Anjin/William Adams.  Here, Tom Cruise is the stranger in a strange land, and the Samurai of Japan are the warrior culture.Being no stranger to Samurai films of Japanese history, I was pleased by all aspects of ""The Last Samurai.""  Both the modernizing Meji government and the past-looking Samurai of the period are well represented, although the Samurai come out looking much better.  The warrior code of Bushido is not explained, and the lifestyle is completely romanticized, yet this is a movie and not a history text.  Emperor Meji is well-played, which surprised me.  He is neither hero nor villain.  And there are ninjas, which improves every film.In the vein of the big Hollywood epics, ""The Last Samurai"" serves up healthy doses of sweeping score, beautiful vistas and Japan-landscape eye candy.  The country has rarely looked so beautiful, although I bet some technicians spent plenty of time computer-erasing the omni-present power lines.  The samurai armor,while not historically accurate, looks beautiful on film.  There are more than a few scenes that leap beautifully from a Kurosawa flick.  A great looking cast helps as well.To this day, Japan has difficulty rationalizing tradition and modernization, as can be seen in books such as ""Dogs and Demons.""  ""The Last Samurai"" has some good lessons for modern Japan, and some good entertainment for us all.",5,Stranger in a Strange Land,1072396800,"12 26, 2003",2003,1783,"['Last', 'Samurai', 'excellent', 'film', 'respectful', 'source', 'material', 'even', 'telling', 'fictional', 'story', 'foreigner', 'warrior', 'culture', 'taking', 'strange', 'dress', 'winning', 'respect', 'story', 'well-represented', 'film', 'history', 'Bonnie', 'Prince', 'Charlie', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'as', 'well', 'Japanese-themed', 'Shogun', 'based', 'life', 'Miura', 'Anjin/William', 'Adams', 'Here', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land', 'Samurai', 'Japan', 'are', 'warrior', 'culture.Being', 'no', 'stranger', 'Samurai', 'films', 'Japanese', 'history', 'was', 'pleased', 'aspects', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'modernizing', 'Meji', 'government', 'past-looking', 'Samurai', 'period', 'are', 'well', 'represented', 'Samurai', 'come', 'out', 'looking', 'much', 'better', 'warrior', 'code', 'Bushido', 'not', 'explained', 'lifestyle', 'completely', 'romanticized', 'yet', 'movie', 'not', 'history', 'text', 'Emperor', 'Meji', 'well-played', 'surprised', 'hero', 'villain', 'are', 'ninjas', 'film.In', 'vein', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'epics', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'up', 'healthy', 'doses', 'sweeping', 'score', 'beautiful', 'vistas', 'Japan-landscape', 'eye', 'candy', 'country', 'rarely', 'looked', 'so', 'beautiful', 'bet', 'technicians', 'spent', 'plenty', 'time', 'computer-erasing', 'omni-present', 'power', 'lines', 'samurai', 'armor', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'beautiful', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'scenes', 'leap', 'beautifully', 'Kurosawa', 'flick', 'great', 'looking', 'cast', 'well.To', 'day', 'Japan', 'difficulty', 'rationalizing', 'tradition', 'modernization', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'books', 'such', 'Dogs', 'Demons', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'good', 'lessons', 'modern', 'Japan', 'good', 'entertainment']",N/A

If you want complete accuracy in regards to the Samurai society check out 'Ran'. If you want a great movie with beautiful scenery, great story, and HUGE battle scenes, watch this masterpiece. It fits perfectly in my collection between Braveheart, Glory, Dances with Wolves, and Saving Private Ryan....Epic.The only thing this movie is lite on is a little bit of reality. As mentioned in previous reviews there are some discrepancies in regards to history which I believe can be written off as artistic license.The only two parts I took issue with invloved the plot. Algren (Tom Cruise) effectivley neutralizing Samurai, and Ninja assasins. There is not much more dangerous combination in the history of mankind than a Samurai with his sword in hand.Secondly the end would have been better had the mentally tortured Algren found peace thru death on the battlefield with his newly adopted comrades. I think he may have been the only one to survive to deliver his anti-western message at the end. This shows he had not fully adopted the Samurai way. He should have taken his life on the field of battle as to avoid capture, as Katsumoto did. Honor and saving face were paramount in Samurai society.Regardless this movie is incredible and is essential for anyone into epic history/war movies.
