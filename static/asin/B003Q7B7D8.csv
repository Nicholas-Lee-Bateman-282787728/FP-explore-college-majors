It is leaning towards the antinuclear side of the damage of the weapon and less time on the expected casualties expected by landing on Japanese soil with an anticipated 1 million GIs dying not to mention how many Japanese would be killed and that the firebombing killed more people than the Nuclear weapons.  It does not discuss the possibility that Japan was ready to surrender prior to August 6.  I have been to both sites, I worked in Guam not far from Tinian Island, and have seen the Nuclear Shadows in person.  It is a moving experience.  The movie and the sites are worthwhile seeing.",4,From the Perspective of a Former SAC Flight Surgeon,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,619,"['enjoyed', 'documentary', 'leaning', 'antinuclear', 'side', 'damage', 'weapon', 'less', 'time', 'expected', 'casualties', 'expected', 'landing', 'Japanese', 'soil', 'anticipated', '1', 'million', 'GIs', 'dying', 'not', 'mention', 'how', 'many', 'Japanese', 'would', 'be', 'killed', 'firebombing', 'killed', 'more', 'people', 'Nuclear', 'weapons', 'not', 'discuss', 'possibility', 'Japan', 'was', 'ready', 'surrender', 'prior', 'August', '6', 'have', 'been', 'sites', 'worked', 'Guam', 'not', 'far', 'Tinian', 'Island', 'have', 'seen', 'Nuclear', 'Shadows', 'person', 'moving', 'experience', 'movie', 'sites', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'seeing']",24 Hours After Hiroshima
1358784,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B003Q7B7D8,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[9, 9]","On August 6, 1945, the B-29 ""Enola Gay"" dropped the world's first atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima.  Many thousands of Japanese died instantly from the resulting blast, shockwave, and firestorm.  Others lingered for years with radiation sickness.  This fine documentary explores the atomic mission itself, along with the aftermath.What I found so interesting about this documentary was the fine use of experts.  I found the officer who rode in the bomb bay of the B-29 and helped with the arming process to be very interesting.  Richard Rhodes' insight into the development and use of the atomic bomb was also good.  But perhaps the most insightful and poignant views were expressed by the Japanese survivors themselves.  These people had to deal with the effects of the bomb for their entire lives.I was also impressed with the discussion of how the bomb was designed.  Th computer illustrations did a good job of explaining the operation of the bomb, from how the firing mechanism worked to the decision to have the bomb detonate at 1,900 feet rather than exploding on impact: (the ground would have absorbed much of the explosion, while an air burst would achieve maximum damage to the city).I'm very familiar with the atomic bomb missions, having read several books on the topic.  This fine documentary enhanced my earlier readings.  National Geographic has done a very good job of explaining the bombing of Hiroshima, and the personal interviews explain the story of the bomb even further.  Highly recommended.",5,An Excellent Documentary,1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,1519,"['August', '6', '1945', 'B-29', 'Enola', 'Gay', 'dropped', 'world', 'first', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'city', 'Hiroshima', 'Many', 'thousands', 'Japanese', 'died', 'instantly', 'resulting', 'blast', 'shockwave', 'firestorm', 'Others', 'lingered', 'years', 'radiation', 'sickness', 'fine', 'documentary', 'atomic', 'mission', 'aftermath.What', 'found', 'so', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'was', 'fine', 'use', 'experts', 'found', 'officer', 'who', 'rode', 'bomb', 'bay', 'B-29', 'helped', 'arming', 'process', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'Richard', 'Rhodes', 'insight', 'development', 'use', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'perhaps', 'most', 'insightful', 'poignant', 'views', 'were', 'expressed', 'Japanese', 'survivors', 'people', 'had', 'deal', 'effects', 'bomb', 'entire', 'lives.I', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'discussion', 'how', 'bomb', 'was', 'designed', 'Th', 'computer', 'illustrations', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'operation', 'bomb', 'how', 'firing', 'mechanism', 'worked', 'decision', 'have', 'bomb', 'detonate', '1,900', 'feet', 'rather', 'exploding', 'impact', 'ground', 'would', 'have', 'absorbed', 'much', 'explosion', 'air', 'burst', 'would', 'achieve', 'maximum', 'damage', 'city', ""'m"", 'very', 'familiar', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'missions', 'having', 'read', 'several', 'books', 'topic', 'fine', 'documentary', 'enhanced', 'earlier', 'readings', 'National', 'Geographic', 'done', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'bombing', 'Hiroshima', 'personal', 'interviews', 'explain', 'story', 'bomb', 'even', 'further', 'Highly', 'recommended']",24 Hours After Hiroshima

1358786,A1WEEDHVH051M,B003Q7B7D8,"P. S. ""Common Sense""","[4, 16]","Updated June 2013:24 hours after Hiroshima is a great and technical documentary from N.G. except for several historical facts. The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were very, very justified by the United States. WWII was a global war and Imperial Japan was a religiously racist nation which was not going to unconditionally surrender even after being repeatedly informed by the U.S. to end all belligerences. Any war of this magnitude negates the boundaries of sensitivity and politeness and one must understand it was an `us democracy' verses `them Imperial religious racists' (or Nazi Socialist racists) morality in global survival. Collateral damage which was indiscriminately and repeatedly initiated by the citizens and soldiers of Imperial Japan justified the sever retaliation of Allied Forces to stop and force the unconditional surrender of the Nation of Japan. So sadly, the views of a couple left wing historians during the documentary contaminate the historical facts and the strategic use of ""the bomb"" during WWII. The empathetic views of the two surviving Japanese children of the Atomic bomb convey the sadness of the destructive experience but represent their deep naive historical confusion as to the justified reasons the bombs were deployed upon their violent Imperialistic Nation. Unfortunately the lamenting ignorance in this documentary is projected in the last statements to be delivered by them and a typical left wing colossal stupid statement in that the use of these weapons was genocide.I am historically grateful that these bombs were used by the United States which ended the war against Imperial Japan and granted the survival of my three Uncles who served in the Pacific Theatre during WWII. If the political belligerent situation was ever necessary to deploy such a devastating weapon again, I would be in agreement with our elected leaders to use it to stop the insane nation which forced our hand to utilize such a weapon.",1,Great but...,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,1971,"['Updated', 'June', '2013:24', 'hours', 'Hiroshima', 'great', 'technical', 'documentary', 'N.G', 'several', 'historical', 'facts', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'dropped', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'justified', 'United', 'States', 'WWII', 'was', 'global', 'war', 'Imperial', 'Japan', 'was', 'religiously', 'racist', 'nation', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'unconditionally', 'surrender', 'even', 'being', 'repeatedly', 'informed', 'U.S.', 'end', 'belligerences', 'Any', 'war', 'magnitude', 'boundaries', 'sensitivity', 'politeness', 'one', 'must', 'understand', 'was', 'democracy', 'verses', 'Imperial', 'religious', 'racists', 'Nazi', 'Socialist', 'racists', 'morality', 'global', 'survival', 'Collateral', 'damage', 'was', 'indiscriminately', 'repeatedly', 'initiated', 'citizens', 'soldiers', 'Imperial', 'Japan', 'justified', 'sever', 'retaliation', 'Allied', 'Forces', 'stop', 'force', 'unconditional', 'surrender', 'Nation', 'Japan', 'So', 'sadly', 'views', 'couple', 'left', 'wing', 'historians', 'documentary', 'contaminate', 'historical', 'facts', 'strategic', 'use', 'bomb', 'WWII', 'empathetic', 'views', 'two', 'surviving', 'Japanese', 'children', 'Atomic', 'bomb', 'convey', 'sadness', 'destructive', 'experience', 'represent', 'deep', 'naive', 'historical', 'confusion', 'justified', 'reasons', 'bombs', 'were', 'deployed', 'violent', 'Imperialistic', 'Nation', 'Unfortunately', 'lamenting', 'ignorance', 'documentary', 'projected', 'last', 'statements', 'be', 'delivered', 'typical', 'left', 'wing', 'colossal', 'stupid', 'statement', 'use', 'weapons', 'was', 'genocide.I', 'am', 'historically', 'grateful', 'bombs', 'were', 'used', 'United', 'States', 'ended', 'war', 'Imperial', 'Japan', 'granted', 'survival', 'three', 'Uncles', 'who', 'served', 'Pacific', 'Theatre', 'WWII', 'political', 'belligerent', 'situation', 'was', 'ever', 'necessary', 'deploy', 'devastating', 'weapon', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'agreement', 'elected', 'leaders', 'use', 'stop', 'insane', 'nation', 'forced', 'hand', 'utilize', 'weapon']",24 Hours After Hiroshima

In short, as another reviewer mentioned ( and the ""documentary"" didn't ) many more Japanese were killed in the weeks of firebombing prior to the two nuclear blasts. And it is telling, that the Japanese waited three weeks after the last blast until they surrendered - and this surrender only occurred after assurances that additional bombs would be dropped - we only had three, and the third was on it's way to the pacific when the surrender occurred. As to the sympathetic victims, there are equally sympathetic stories in the prisoner of war camps of Japan and Germany. Additionally, there are equal stories from Pearl Harbor, Dresden and Tokyo. My father certainly would have died in the invasion of Japan along with many many more on both sides, he wrote a letter to Truman thanking him for making the hard decision in dropping the bombs, and he received a grateful reply back from the then ex-presedent. That letter is now on display at the LCS museum in Vallejo, CA.For a better documentary on the final bombing of Japan, look for the recent PBS special on the subject.
