Since then I have watched ""Backlash"" twice more.  I have always liked Richard Widmark in Westerns.  He is a very good actor and he fits the part. And Donna Reed is nice to look at.  She plays a rather steamy role in this movie (steamy for the time in which the movie was made). Without going into the details, I will tell you that ""Backlash"" has a unique story line, beautiful outdoor locations, a great cast of actors, good acting, and plenty of action. I especially enjoy seeing the majestic desert and mountain scenery (and Donna Reed).  The actions scenes are plentiful and well done. There are a few unexpected events in the movie that help make things interesting. Over the years, I have watched literally hundreds of Western movies.  Backlash is a very good movie and I must wonder why it has never been included in the mainstream of Western movies.

868313,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B0006HGSIK,Muzzlehatch,"[10, 10]","As of this writing in 2010 there are still plenty of westerns from Hollywood's ""golden age"" - and in particular the western's peak decade of the 1950s - that still haven't made the translation from VHS to DVD.  While the typically grainy and muddy, panned-and-scanned tapes from companies like Questar or Goodtimes are poor substitutes for a good DVD, there's no telling when some of this stuff will show up - even a larger-budgeted affair like this one, directed by A-lister John Sturges and starring Richard Widmark.  So sometimes, the western buff might want to take a chance, and so I did...And the film was definitely worth watching, though action man Sturges didn't do nearly as much with the interesting psychological underpinnings of the story as he does with the several well-shot action sequences.  A lone rider dressed in black approaches a lone, ruined outpost - a man takes a bead from a rocky outcropping above.  The rider dismounts and walks towards a man rooting around in the ruins, who turns out to be Jeff Slater (Widmark).  The rider is Karyl Orton (Donna Reed), and she's apparently aware that she's being watched by a gunman, as she asks Slater to get her some cigarettes from her pack and to get shot at.  After Slater climbs up the rock heap and takes out the gunman - who happens to be a sheriff's deputy from the nearby town of Silver City - we start to find out why these two are interested in the burned-out buildings in the middle of nowhere.It turns out that there's gold involved - and murder.  $60,000 was involved in the deaths of the five men buried there, and one man who left them behind.  Slater is looking for his father, Orton for her husband; neither knows for certain who is buried, and who might still be alive - or why the sixth person ran out on the other five, who were evidently killed by Apaches.  The bulk of the film after this opening, then, is devoted to tracking down people who know more about the killings and might know the identity of the sixth person.  Eventually Slater and Orton get involved in a range feud some distance away and it becomes quickly clear that one of the ranchers involved, Jim Bonniwell (John McIntire) is the man they seek, having started up his operation just a few years previously - with $60,000.This is a flavorful, fairly exciting western, with the action sequences very well handled by Sturges, though as I mentioned earlier, there's a lot of interesting psychological stuff going on that pretty much gets thrown by the wayside - why is Slater, a clearly excellent gunslinger, so opposed to the concept that his father could be an outlaw, for example, and what does it say that both Orton and Slater are tracking down men that deserted them, and don't want to be found?  Widmark is terrific as usual, and apart from McIntire the most interesting performance is probably the somewhat anachronistic slick 50s-looking William Campbell as McIntire's itchy-fingered hired gun ""Johnny Cool"".  Doesn't sound all that ""western"" does it?  Reed struggles a bit I think, perhaps because it's hard to really believe in the motivation of her character, or in the ability she has to find a new wardrobe for every occasion out of one saddlebag.  Perhaps that adds to the fun also; this is definitely a film that works better if you just try not to think too much about either the artificiality of much of it, or the underpinnings of the story that don't really get enough play.  Best to just enjoy it as the reasonably well done mainstream genre exercise it is.",4,Excellent Widmark western deserves a resurrection,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,3530,"['writing', '2010', 'are', 'still', 'plenty', 'westerns', 'Hollywood', 'golden', 'age', 'particular', 'western', 'peak', 'decade', '1950s', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'translation', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'typically', 'grainy', 'muddy', 'panned-and-scanned', 'tapes', 'companies', 'Questar', 'Goodtimes', 'are', 'poor', 'substitutes', 'good', 'DVD', 'telling', 'when', 'stuff', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'even', 'larger-budgeted', 'affair', 'one', 'directed', 'A-lister', 'John', 'Sturges', 'starring', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'So', 'sometimes', 'western', 'buff', 'might', 'want', 'take', 'chance', 'so', 'did', 'film', 'was', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'action', 'man', 'Sturges', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'underpinnings', 'story', 'several', 'well-shot', 'action', 'sequences', 'lone', 'rider', 'dressed', 'black', 'approaches', 'lone', 'ruined', 'outpost', 'man', 'bead', 'rocky', 'outcropping', 'rider', 'dismounts', 'walks', 'towards', 'man', 'rooting', 'around', 'ruins', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Jeff', 'Slater', 'Widmark', 'rider', 'Karyl', 'Orton', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'apparently', 'aware', 'being', 'watched', 'gunman', 'Slater', 'get', 'cigarettes', 'pack', 'get', 'shot', 'Slater', 'climbs', 'up', 'rock', 'heap', 'out', 'gunman', 'who', 'be', 'sheriff', 'deputy', 'nearby', 'town', 'Silver', 'City', 'start', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'two', 'are', 'interested', 'burned-out', 'buildings', 'middle', 'nowhere.It', 'out', 'gold', 'involved', 'murder', '60,000', 'was', 'involved', 'deaths', 'five', 'men', 'buried', 'there', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'left', 'Slater', 'looking', 'father', 'Orton', 'husband', 'knows', 'certain', 'who', 'buried', 'who', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'why', 'sixth', 'person', 'ran', 'out', 'other', 'five', 'who', 'were', 'evidently', 'killed', 'Apaches', 'bulk', 'film', 'opening', 'then', 'devoted', 'tracking', 'down', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'more', 'killings', 'might', 'know', 'identity', 'sixth', 'person', 'Eventually', 'Slater', 'Orton', 'get', 'involved', 'range', 'feud', 'distance', 'away', 'quickly', 'clear', 'one', 'ranchers', 'involved', 'Jim', 'Bonniwell', 'John', 'McIntire', 'man', 'seek', 'having', 'started', 'up', 'operation', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'previously', '60,000.This', 'flavorful', 'fairly', 'exciting', 'western', 'action', 'very', 'well', 'handled', 'Sturges', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'lot', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'stuff', 'going', 'pretty', 'much', 'thrown', 'wayside', 'why', 'Slater', 'clearly', 'excellent', 'gunslinger', 'so', 'opposed', 'concept', 'father', 'could', 'be', 'outlaw', 'example', 'what', 'say', 'Orton', 'Slater', 'are', 'tracking', 'down', 'men', 'deserted', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'found', 'Widmark', 'terrific', 'usual', 'apart', 'McIntire', 'most', 'interesting', 'performance', 'probably', 'somewhat', 'anachronistic', 'slick', '50s-looking', 'William', 'Campbell', 'McIntire', 'itchy-fingered', 'hired', 'gun', 'Johnny', 'Cool', ""n't"", 'sound', 'western', 'Reed', 'bit', 'think', 'perhaps', 'hard', 'really', 'believe', 'motivation', 'character', 'ability', 'find', 'new', 'wardrobe', 'occasion', 'one', 'saddlebag', 'Perhaps', 'fun', 'also', 'definitely', 'film', 'better', 'just', 'try', 'not', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'artificiality', 'much', 'underpinnings', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'enough', 'play', 'Best', 'just', 'enjoy', 'reasonably', 'well', 'done', 'mainstream', 'genre', 'exercise']",N/A
