502136,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00000I69D,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","I have recently spent some little effort making comparisons between old time country blues singers. My winners have been Skip James and Son House. Apparently, if the story behind the Robert Johnson story presented here is right I am in a minority compared to the like of Eric Clapton and Keith Richards. So be it. After viewing this very informative bio, complete with the inevitable ""talking heads' that populate these kinds of film efforts I still have that same opinion, except I would hold Johnson's version of his ""Sweet Home, Chicago"" in higher regard after listening to it here. Previously many other covers seemed better, a lot better. Roosevelt Sykes' version, for one.The producers of this film have spend some time and thought on presentation. The choice of Danny Glover as expressive and thoughtful narrator was a welcome sign. Having Johnson road companion and fellow blues artist, Johnny Shines, give insights into Johnson's work habits, traveling ways, womanizing, whiskey drinking and personality make this a very strong film. Add in footage of Son House (an early Johnson influence) and various other Delta artists ""doing the devils' work who met or were met by Johnson along the way on that dangerous Highway 61 and one gets the feeling that this is more a labor of love than anything else.  For a man who lived fast, died young and left a relatively small body of work this is a very good take on Robert Johnson. I might add that if Johnson is your number one blues man this film gives you plenty of ammunition for your position.Note: As is almost universally true with such documentary endeavors we only get snippets of the music. I would have liked to hear a full ""Preacher's Blues"", ""Sweet Home, Chicago"", Terraplane Blues"" and ""Hell Hounds On My Heels"" but for that you will have to look elsewhere",4,Hell Hounds On His Heels,1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,1820,"['have', 'recently', 'spent', 'little', 'effort', 'making', 'comparisons', 'old', 'time', 'country', 'singers', 'winners', 'have', 'been', 'Skip', 'James', 'Son', 'House', 'Apparently', 'story', 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'story', 'presented', 'here', 'right', 'am', 'minority', 'compared', 'like', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'So', 'be', 'viewing', 'very', 'informative', 'bio', 'complete', 'inevitable', 'talking', 'heads', 'populate', 'kinds', 'film', 'efforts', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'opinion', 'would', 'hold', 'Johnson', 'version', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Chicago', 'higher', 'regard', 'listening', 'here', 'Previously', 'many', 'other', 'covers', 'seemed', 'better', 'lot', 'better', 'Roosevelt', 'Sykes', 'version', 'one.The', 'producers', 'film', 'have', 'spend', 'time', 'thought', 'presentation', 'choice', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'expressive', 'thoughtful', 'narrator', 'was', 'welcome', 'sign', 'Having', 'Johnson', 'road', 'companion', 'fellow', 'blues', 'artist', 'Johnny', 'Shines', 'give', 'insights', 'Johnson', 'work', 'habits', 'traveling', 'ways', 'womanizing', 'whiskey', 'drinking', 'personality', 'make', 'very', 'strong', 'film', 'Add', 'footage', 'Son', 'House', 'early', 'Johnson', 'influence', 'various', 'other', 'Delta', 'doing', 'devils', 'work', 'who', 'met', 'were', 'met', 'Johnson', 'way', 'dangerous', 'Highway', '61', 'one', 'feeling', 'more', 'labor', 'love', 'anything', 'else', 'man', 'who', 'lived', 'fast', 'died', 'young', 'left', 'relatively', 'small', 'body', 'work', 'very', 'good', 'take', 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'might', 'add', 'Johnson', 'number', 'one', 'man', 'film', 'plenty', 'ammunition', 'position.Note', 'As', 'almost', 'universally', 'true', 'such', 'documentary', 'endeavors', 'only', 'get', 'snippets', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'full', 'Preacher', 'Blues', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Chicago', 'Terraplane', 'Blues', 'Hell', 'Hounds', 'My', 'Heels', 'will', 'have', 'look', 'elsewhere']",N/A

Part of the reason it's lacking certain things is the limitations for commercial interuption on the air.

Many songs are haunting (Hellhound on My Trail, Come On In My Kitchen) and many are sad (Drunkenhearted Man,From Four Til Late)but they all carry Johnsons'unique stamp on the blues. One listen and you'll hear it.Danny Glover's narration is compassionate and blues musician Keb Mos' silhouetted figure makes you feel that you are watching actual footage of Johnson himself.
