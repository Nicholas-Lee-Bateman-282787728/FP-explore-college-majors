1541270,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0081HLM2E,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","`Headhunters' is a fun ride.  It has thrills and some excellent technical work and the story is compelling enough to keep your interest throughout.  It tells the story of a young man who makes a living stealing valuable art pieces and selling them off.  He isn't the most attractive young man and yet he manages, through his wallet, to secure for himself a KNOCKOUT girlfriend and a KNOCKOUT mistress.  Apparently, it isn't all in his wallet (that aspect being in his head) since they both seem to genuinely have feelings for him.  He winds up getting in way too far over his head when he attempts to steal from a new suave prospect putting the moves on his girlfriend.  Next thing you know he's running for his life as he becomes the hunted in a wicked game of cat and mouse.The film is adapted from Swedish author Jo Nesbo's novel.  I'm currently in the middle of reading Nesbo's `The Snowman', so I can say that the film certainly carries his stamp of delivery.  I can see his writing in the film despite the fact that I haven't read the source material.`Headhunters' is fluid.My issue with the movie is that it lacks any real bite.  I won't say that it isn't thrilling, because it does have those elements, but at the end of the day it is truly forgettable.  Fun, for forgettable.  Unlike other Swedish bred murder films (namely `The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo') `Headhunters' can't rise up to make us remember it when it's over.  It lacks the haunting quality that is needed to make it a better film.  Instead, it is just a little too familiar, pulling from other films (at times obviously) and it struggles with finding a tone (it really wants to insert humor in places it doesn't fit) and some of the plot developments are just obvious and sorely underplayed.Bah, it could have been great, but it will have to settle with good.

One the outside, the relatively short man has a glamorous life complete with a fancy house, nice car, expensive suits, and a gorgeous wife (a breakout performance by newbie Synnve Macody Lund). As they usually are, things are different behind the scenes for Roger. Aside from some issues with his marriage, Roger happens to also have the secret of being an art thief when he's not doing his day job as a corporate headhunter.Roger's wife, Diana, happens to own an art gallery. As fate would have it, an acquaintance of Diana's, Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) tells her about a very rare painting he is in the possession of. Upon hearing of this, Roger decides this is his next mark. Roger, along with his accomplice Ove (Eivind Sander) coordinate the heist. The situation turns out to be more than what Roger bargained for when its discovered Clas is a former mercenary and a big wig of a tech company that makes GPS tracking devices.The film's sly sense of humor and charismatic lead immediately drew me into the picture, but I have to say once the action of the plot kicked in, I couldn't turn away. I honestly didn't expect the action the film had, and the several twists and turns it took. The movie just doesn't let up, but it's far more than just being about the action. The storyline is clever and exciting and the film does a great job of building on the characters and making us feel something for them.Headhunters is yet another example of how the Scandinavians are doing something so right that Hollywood can't seem to grasp. The movie was an exciting thriller while also having a well thought out plot and well written characters. What I really appreciated was the amount of dark humor the film had, which wasn't arbitrarily added in, it naturally added some comic relief without being turning the film into a farce. There's also the drama between the characters, especially Roger and Diana, that felt genuine and again built on our feelings towards the characters.This film is likely my favorite of the year. It had it all: crime, action, plot twists, and the pacing was perfect. The film looks great and has a cool style to it, but it manages to pull of being a stylish flick without showboating or coming off as being full of itself. Headhunters is certainly a serious film, but it's intelligent way of combining the many aforementioned traits keep it quite entertaining.Source: criticnic.com 28 December 2012",5,Superb crime thriller,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,2860,"['have', 'always', 'had', 'big', 'interest', 'Scandinavian', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'come', 'neck', 'woods', 'almost', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'loving', 'films', 'Once', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'Headhunters', 'based', 'novel', 'increasingly', 'popular', 'author', 'Jo', 'Nesb', 'just', 'had', 'feeling', 'would', 'love', 'it.The', 'film', 'introduced', 'main', 'character', 'Roger', 'Brown', 'Askel', 'Hennie', 'who', 'insight', 'life', 'One', 'outside', 'relatively', 'short', 'man', 'glamorous', 'life', 'complete', 'fancy', 'house', 'nice', 'car', 'expensive', 'suits', 'gorgeous', 'wife', 'breakout', 'performance', 'newbie', 'Synnve', 'Macody', 'Lund', 'usually', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'different', 'scenes', 'Roger', 'Aside', 'issues', 'marriage', 'Roger', 'also', 'have', 'secret', 'being', 'art', 'thief', 'when', 'not', 'doing', 'day', 'job', 'corporate', 'headhunter.Roger', 'wife', 'Diana', 'own', 'art', 'gallery', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'acquaintance', 'Diana', 'Clas', 'Greve', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'very', 'rare', 'painting', 'possession', 'hearing', 'Roger', 'next', 'mark', 'Roger', 'accomplice', 'Ove', 'Eivind', 'Sander', 'coordinate', 'heist', 'situation', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'what', 'Roger', 'bargained', 'when', 'discovered', 'Clas', 'former', 'mercenary', 'big', 'wig', 'tech', 'company', 'GPS', 'tracking', 'devices.The', 'film', 'sly', 'sense', 'humor', 'charismatic', 'lead', 'immediately', 'drew', 'picture', 'have', 'say', 'once', 'action', 'plot', 'kicked', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'away', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'action', 'film', 'had', 'several', 'twists', 'took', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'far', 'more', 'just', 'being', 'action', 'storyline', 'clever', 'exciting', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'building', 'characters', 'making', 'feel', 'something', 'them.Headhunters', 'yet', 'example', 'how', 'Scandinavians', 'are', 'doing', 'something', 'so', 'right', 'Hollywood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'grasp', 'movie', 'was', 'exciting', 'thriller', 'also', 'having', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'plot', 'well', 'written', 'characters', 'What', 'really', 'appreciated', 'was', 'amount', 'dark', 'humor', 'film', 'had', 'was', ""n't"", 'arbitrarily', 'added', 'naturally', 'added', 'comic', 'relief', 'being', 'turning', 'film', 'farce', 'also', 'drama', 'characters', 'especially', 'Roger', 'Diana', 'felt', 'genuine', 'again', 'built', 'feelings', 'characters.This', 'film', 'likely', 'favorite', 'year', 'had', 'crime', 'action', 'plot', 'twists', 'pacing', 'was', 'perfect', 'film', 'great', 'cool', 'style', 'pull', 'being', 'stylish', 'flick', 'showboating', 'coming', 'off', 'being', 'full', 'Headhunters', 'certainly', 'serious', 'film', 'intelligent', 'way', 'combining', 'many', 'aforementioned', 'traits', 'keep', 'quite', 'entertaining.Source', 'criticnic.com', '28', 'December', '2012']",Headhunters

1541296,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0081HLM2E,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","HEADHUNTERS is an extremely well-produced black comedy that borrows liberally from the cat-and-mouse white-collar caper flicks of many nations.  Executive headhunter Roger Brown is played by Aksel Hennie with a performance that elevates certain plot elements that would otherwise serve as dead weight in lesser pictures; while his day job tasks him with recruiting senior-level talent for his country&#8217;s most successful businesses, his side job &#8211; that as an art thief &#8211; is what&#8217;s necessary to keep his earnings up to the level he needs to support his marriage to the beautiful and statuesque Diana (Synnve Macody Lund).When his heist of a painting believed to have been stolen by the Nazi surfaces in the unlikely hands of his latest candidate Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) sets in motion a curious series of events that lead death and destruction, Brown must go to lengths unimagined to save his life, clear his name, and rescue his marriage (yes, in that order).However, as technically accomplished as the film is, HEADHUNTERS largely benefits from Hennie&#8217;s winning performance as the world&#8217;s most likeable narcissist.  He narrates the film&#8217;s opening and a clever coda following the mildly far-fetched climax; but his focus on maintaining what I could only describe as his &#8216;criminal integrity&#8217; is all that I found truly credible and integral to the film.  The picture boasts some rather elaborate confrontation sequences &#8211; Greve is a former special forces commando who knows more than a thing or two about making people disappear &#8211; that, sadly, don&#8217;t quite mesh as solidly with the narrative as they should.  Also, as the story builds, the level of gore committed to the successive clashes really grows gratuitous.Also, come the film&#8217;s big finish, I was left with a small handful of questions regarding how all of Greve&#8217;s supposed scheme was to logically come to fruition, as well as what he honestly hoped to accomplish as a result of it.  Honestly, that&#8217;s probably because that never truly resonates as part of the flick&#8217;s narrative; rather, it&#8217;s left as a bare bones plot device to get these characters together.  The former soldier clearly has recruited more people to serve in support roles for his ploy, as evidenced by the character Lotte (Julie R. Olgaard); however, she&#8217;s given absolutely no history within the story, so her skills as a somewhat stone cold killer-wannabe are left dangling as the loose end it remains.Also, I&#8217;d be remiss in my duties if I didn&#8217;t mention that the film scored several significant nominations and/or wins from European and beyond film programs, many of which centered on either Hennie&#8217;s contributions here or some of the flick&#8217;s more practical elements.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  While I personally feel the film doesn&#8217;t quite approach the level of perfection or entertainment as suggestion by many, many others, I still think HEADHUNTERS remains a solid viewing experience.  Don&#8217;t look for all of it to make perfect sense &#8211; as I alluded, it&#8217;s much more a black comedy than a true heist picture &#8211; and you&#8217;ll probably enjoy it like most did.",4,Technically-Accomplished HEADHUNTERS Certainly Delivers A Unique Vision,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,3248,"['HEADHUNTERS', 'extremely', 'well-produced', 'black', 'comedy', 'liberally', 'cat-and-mouse', 'white-collar', 'caper', 'flicks', 'many', 'nations', 'Executive', 'headhunter', 'Roger', 'Brown', 'played', 'Aksel', 'Hennie', 'performance', 'certain', 'plot', 'elements', 'would', 'otherwise', 'serve', 'dead', 'weight', 'lesser', 'pictures', 'day', 'job', 'tasks', 'recruiting', 'senior-level', 'talent', 'country', '8217', 'most', 'successful', 'businesses', 'side', 'job', '8211', 'art', 'thief', '8211', 'what', '8217', 'necessary', 'keep', 'earnings', 'up', 'level', 'support', 'marriage', 'beautiful', 'statuesque', 'Diana', 'Synnve', 'Macody', 'Lund', '.When', 'heist', 'painting', 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'stolen', 'Nazi', 'surfaces', 'unlikely', 'hands', 'latest', 'candidate', 'Clas', 'Greve', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'motion', 'curious', 'series', 'events', 'lead', 'death', 'destruction', 'Brown', 'must', 'go', 'lengths', 'unimagined', 'save', 'life', 'clear', 'name', 'rescue', 'marriage', 'yes', 'order', '.However', 'technically', 'accomplished', 'film', 'HEADHUNTERS', 'largely', 'benefits', 'Hennie', '8217', 'winning', 'performance', 'world', '8217', 'most', 'likeable', 'narcissist', 'film', '8217', 'opening', 'clever', 'coda', 'following', 'mildly', 'far-fetched', 'climax', 'focus', 'maintaining', 'what', 'could', 'only', 'describe', '8216', 'criminal', 'integrity', '8217', 'found', 'truly', 'credible', 'integral', 'film', 'picture', 'rather', 'elaborate', 'confrontation', 'sequences', '8211', 'Greve', 'former', 'special', 'forces', 'commando', 'who', 'more', 'thing', 'two', 'making', 'people', 'disappear', '8211', 'sadly', 'don', '8217', 'quite', 'mesh', 'solidly', 'narrative', 'should', 'Also', 'story', 'builds', 'level', 'gore', 'committed', 'successive', 'clashes', 'really', 'gratuitous.Also', 'come', 'film', '8217', 'big', 'finish', 'was', 'left', 'small', 'handful', 'questions', 'regarding', 'how', 'Greve', '8217', 's', 'supposed', 'scheme', 'was', 'logically', 'come', 'fruition', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'honestly', 'hoped', 'accomplish', 'result', 'Honestly', '8217', 's', 'probably', 'never', 'truly', 'part', 'flick', '8217', 's', 'narrative', 'rather', '8217', 's', 'left', 'bare', 'plot', 'device', 'get', 'characters', 'together', 'former', 'soldier', 'clearly', 'recruited', 'more', 'people', 'serve', 'support', 'roles', 'ploy', 'evidenced', 'character', 'Lotte', 'Julie', 'R.', 'Olgaard', 'however', '8217', 's', 'given', 'absolutely', 'history', 'story', 'skills', 'somewhat', 'stone', 'cold', 'killer-wannabe', 'are', 'left', 'dangling', 'loose', 'end', '8217', 'be', 'remiss', 'duties', 'didn', '8217', 'mention', 'film', 'scored', 'several', 'significant', 'nominations', 'and/or', 'wins', 'European', 'film', 'programs', 'many', 'centered', 'Hennie', '8217', 's', 'contributions', 'here', 'flick', '8217', 'more', 'practical', 'elements.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'personally', 'feel', 'film', 'doesn', '8217', 'quite', 'approach', 'level', 'perfection', 'entertainment', 'suggestion', 'many', 'many', 'others', 'still', 'think', 'HEADHUNTERS', 'solid', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Don', '8217', 'look', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', '8211', 'alluded', '8217', 's', 'much', 'more', 'black', 'comedy', 'true', 'heist', 'picture', '8211', '8217', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'most', 'did']",Headhunters

That being said, I'm glad to see it because this deserves a wide audience.Here's the scoop. Roger Brown is a high-level head hunter who uses his position to gain enough info from prospective candidates to rob them of valuable artwork and support his lavish lifestyle and gorgeous wife. He slips up by targeting a candidate who has worked with a high tech company in possession of nano-tracking technology. Said candidate has also worked as an operative in various hot spots around the world. Roger simply chose the wrong target and is literally in deep doo-doo.This is one clever flick. The plot is just complicated enough to keep the viewer in the game. It unfolds at a very even pace. There was no time in the film that I felt things were lagging. There are also some nifty ways the plot turns as well as some very shocking, disgusting, surreal occurrences that caught me totally off guard. At a certain point this becomes a cat and mouse game which is something I enjoy in a flick. These two guys are surprisingly well matched though it might not seem so at first glance. Seeing the 'back and forth' play out is very satisfying. As in a Hitchcock thriller, the protagonist gets in so deep you cannot imagine he'll dig his way out. You just hang in and hope.All the production values, directing, music, etc. are of high order. I liked the actors and the color palette. This is just a nifty flick from top to bottom. About the only weak spot was at the end where they had to visually and through narrative lead the viewer to how all this was going to play out. This was a common technique in mystery thrillers of the 40s but has pretty much disappeared since. Other than that, plant your jaws into this.

1541302,AC96YWEZDFAN,B0081HLM2E,Grouchy  Smurf,"[1, 2]","The Headhunters tells the story of 5 foot 6 inches tall Roger Brown, who is a headhunter (recruiter for top-level managers). Roger has a beautiful wife, and because of his fear of losing her he showers her with lavish gifts and an expensive home - things that are beyond his means. To support this lifestyle, he steals valuable paintings on the side - from his clients. However, when Roger steals a very expensive painting from an enigmatic client, things take an unexpected - and scary - turn and his life turns upside down.I thoroughly enjoyed the Headhunters - I thought the acting was superb and that the script was clever. Sure, there are some hardly believable scenes, but overall it was quite believable. The movie starts slow but picks up pace quickly and then never slows down. There are quite a few twists and turns - some of them easily anticipated, others quite surprising. I especially liked Aksel Hennie in the leading role but the other actors/actresses did a good job as well.There are a few grisly scenes in this movie, so be aware of that. The movie itself is not meant to be a bloodbath or anything, but a few scenes were pretty gruesome. The version I thought was subtitled, and I know some people don't like that. I didn't have any difficulty following the movie though. Overall, I would rate this pretty highly - I think it goes to show that you can make a solid movie without a bunch of big explosions and fires and other bells and whistles that Hollywood relies so much on these days. I think it all ends in the story, and I thought the story here was well-crafted. If you enjoy fast-paced edge of your seat thrillers, I think you'll like this one. If you are looking for a movie with a lot of fight scenes and/or lots of explosions, this isn't your movie.",4,Nice little gem,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,1780,"['Headhunters', 'story', '5', 'foot', '6', 'inches', 'tall', 'Roger', 'Brown', 'who', 'headhunter', 'recruiter', 'top-level', 'managers', 'Roger', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'fear', 'losing', 'lavish', 'gifts', 'expensive', 'home', 'things', 'are', 'means', 'support', 'lifestyle', 'valuable', 'paintings', 'side', 'clients', 'However', 'when', 'Roger', 'very', 'expensive', 'painting', 'enigmatic', 'client', 'things', 'take', 'unexpected', 'scary', 'turn', 'life', 'upside', 'down.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Headhunters', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'script', 'was', 'clever', 'Sure', 'are', 'hardly', 'believable', 'scenes', 'overall', 'was', 'quite', 'believable', 'movie', 'slow', 'up', 'pace', 'quickly', 'then', 'never', 'down', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'twists', 'easily', 'anticipated', 'others', 'quite', 'surprising', 'especially', 'liked', 'Aksel', 'Hennie', 'leading', 'role', 'other', 'actors/actresses', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'well.There', 'are', 'few', 'grisly', 'scenes', 'movie', 'so', 'be', 'aware', 'movie', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'bloodbath', 'anything', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'pretty', 'gruesome', 'version', 'thought', 'was', 'subtitled', 'know', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'difficulty', 'following', 'movie', 'Overall', 'would', 'rate', 'highly', 'think', 'show', 'can', 'make', 'solid', 'movie', 'bunch', 'big', 'explosions', 'fires', 'other', 'bells', 'whistles', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'much', 'days', 'think', 'story', 'thought', 'story', 'here', 'was', 'well-crafted', 'enjoy', 'fast-paced', 'edge', 'seat', 'thrillers', 'think', ""'ll"", 'like', 'one', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'lot', 'fight', 'scenes', 'and/or', 'lots', 'explosions', ""n't"", 'movie']",Headhunters

Not successful enough to afford the lifestyle he and his gorgeous amazon wife live, however. So Roger and Ove, who works for a security company, have a racket. Ove turns off a house's security system, and Roger burgles the house of its expensive artwork. The key is that they replace the painting with a copy, so the trail is cold by the time the theft is discovered.Roger is not likable. He cheats on his wife. The chip on his shoulder is enormous. He's successful as a headhunter because he is good at manipulation. But by about the middle of the film, I started feeling really sorry for him. Roger is a jerk, but he is a non-violent jerk. And after meeting Clas Greve at the opening of Diana's new art gallery, his world doesn't just start falling apart, it starts falling violently apart. Clas is one mean man to cross.Through it all, Roger keeps his head. He is quick on his feet and I admire intelligence on the spot. And, after a while, I started rooting for him because, golly, how many times does a man have to be shot at before you simply have to be on his side?The plotting of ""Headhunters"" is great. Twists and turns and positively Kafkaesque at times. But there's humor, too, though it is mostly black humor. But anyone can relate to using a toilet paper tube to breathe as you submerge yourself in an outhouse pit. At the end, it all comes together in a great AHA climax.""Headhunters"" is definitely not a movie for the squeamish or for kids. There's a lot of blood and a lot of gore, with sex thrown in for good measure.  But if you don't mind the violence, watch it for the keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat plot. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Clas Greve, may be better known for his part as Jaimie Lassiter, in the HBO series, ""Game of Thrones"". In ""Headhunters"", he's easy on the eyes even while his special forces flintiness makes you worry for poor Roger.""Headhunters"" was filmed in Norway, and we watched it with English subtitles.

""Behind the Scenes of Headhunters"" (20 minutes) This is also in Norwegian with English subtitles. It was enjoyable, and has comments by the actors playing major characters, as well as the director, cinematographer, producer and screenwriter. Producer Asle Vatn talks about how scheduling was difficult, because they knew they wanted Coster-Waldau, but ""We are shooting at the same time as 'Game of Thrones'. He's in Ireland and we're in Norway.""Claus Greve's murderous dog is played by a 140 pound pitbull.

Hodejegerne, an R-rated Norwegian crime thriller (English captions), is exciting, involving, unpredictable and intelligent. It has relatable characters, a wonderful plot and is beautifully acted. We in the audience left the theater happily talking to ourselves.A skilled art thief hears of a priceless Rubens, stolen during WWII and kept in a private collection all these years. He realizes this could be the deal that puts him and his wife on easy street for the rest of their lives. Thus begins our story.We see:* Aksel Hennie (""Age of Heroes"") is our pint-sized cat burglar, impeccably groomed, smart as a whip and always trying to improve his theft of high-end art. His day job is to find and interview applicants for new executive positions.* Synnve Macody Lund (TV roles) is his statuesque wife, blonde, successful and longing to have a baby. She owns an art gallery.* Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (""Game of Thrones"") is a former hi-tech special ops guy who wants the job as CEO of a company our hero represents. He has come to Norway to settle his aunt's estate.* Eivind Sander (""Cupid's Balls"") is our hero's fence and inside man for those pesky burglar alarms. Problem is, he rarely uses the brain in his big head. He and his libido entertain thousands on the Internet.* Reidar Srensen (""Home for Christmas"") is the brilliant and politically astute detective who gets involved in the situation.This fast-moving plot sucks you in before you know it. There is tension, surprise, and impressive use of modern technology: GPS, cell phones and the Internet. Expect guns, knives, cars, trucks, attack dogs, and a farm tractor, plus a couple of really gross bits. There is little or no profanity or blowie uppie stuff.

Clever script; well acted; well done.Its plot may be a bit heavy on 90 degree turns, but on the other hand, the film makers pull it off.  Even when credulityis being strained a tad.

Of course, the story is a lot deeper than that, but I'd rather not spoil this excellent film.The story packs in plenty of thrills and twists to keep the audience at the edge of their seats and gasping in awe; the film also uses immersive dialogue to keep the audience fully engaged. There are many thrilling scenes in this film; my favorite is the sequence in the cabin where Roger must hide in an outhouse, which is packed with thrills and disgusts. (You can probably guess, but I won't spoil the reason.) The ending of the film was great and twisted. There is a lot of violence in the film and some vicious gore effects. It's beautifully shot, as well. The acting was also amazing; I haven't seen many Norwegian films so I didn't recognize most of the actors, but I plan on watching more after this phenomenal film. I also enjoyed the music.Overall, Headhunters is a brilliant crime thriller. It's thoroughly entertaining and captivating; I couldn't look away and refused to take any breaks.

I consider myself an old redneck, and no redneck, not male, not female, would use the descriptor &#34;Certain sequences in Headhunters made me gasp.&#34;  Rednecks don't gasp.  They say &#34;daa-yum.&#34;  For me, there was a few heartfelt (an adjective not very redneck, but, hey, I'm tryin to say something over here...) &#34;daa-yums&#34; in Headhunters, yes sir, yes m'am.This is a Nordic film, subtitled, but please don't let that stop you.  And, if you have to, just sit Darnell and Bubba down for a spell, try to get it into their thick redneck skulls that not all daa-yum good movies is made in English.  Be gentle, but persistent.  And don't let Darnell drink no beer during your presentation.To wit, Headhunters portrays a quite successful &#34;headhunter&#34; i.e. a high-up suit who recruits, who places talented men and women in corporations seeking same.  My good friend, the beautiful and dignified Michelle, got her Associates' Welding Certificate (she loves tig) and was recruited by a &#34;headhunter.&#34;  She started off pulling down 50K, so maybe all them rednecks doing trade work aint so stupid after all.The guy, the Headhunter, is also a high-line pro art thief who goes after a twenty million dollar painting owned by another suit who's being interviewed for some position, and the Headhunter uses these interviews to gather information which is of tactical value to his art-stealing sideline.  When the Headhunter interviews this one suit, the Headhunter comes to realize he's got a twenty million dollar score to take down.And, from there, kids, we're off to the races.Headhunters is incredible.You'll get to meet the Headhunter's main fence confidante, a Nordic redneck (yeah, we're all over the damn place!  Sometimes, we don't even speak English too good!), a lovable dufus with an arsenal and an abiding fondness for Russian prostitues, and the Headhunter's wife, a tall, Nordic lass so beautiful &#34;she don't even look real,&#34; like Aljoseph used to say.Enjoy.

It also involves a science fiction device that seems so out of place in a real world scenario like the one the movie takes place in. Billions are also in stake for the antagonist, who seems to be working for a larger group, and has a lot of Special Forces military connections, yet he works alone instead of having a team that would have finished the job easily.The spectacle of this movie is all the suffering the protagonist has to endure at the hands of the antagonist. The protagonist,is acted superbly by the lead actor Aksel Hennie, there is a scene in a ravine where he is all bloody and crying and this wrenched my heart out. Part of the hype revolves around Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's performance, currently popular for his role in the `Game of Thrones' series. I didn't consider his role to have required a high level of ability, he just has to look menacing, but he is a handsome, charismatic bastard and thus you will look forward to his scenes.This used to be at a much higher price, around $24, a price I would have regretted paying.

Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) is a shrewd corporate headhunter. He gets the right person for his company and makes the prospect's reputation with an aggressive attitude and unconventional advice. He's also short and financially overextended. Roger moonlights as an art thief to support a lavish lifestyle and, especially, to impress his beautiful, statuesque wife Diana (Synnve Macody Lund), whom he always fears will leave him for someone taller and richer. Desperate for cash, bank account overdrawn, Roger needs to score big. He finds his target in a conspicuously charming Dutchman, Clas Greve (Nicolaj Coster-Waldau), who is harboring a Reubens painting in his Oslo apartment. But Greve, a Special Ops veteran and ruthless CEO, will prove to be a more formidable, and more violent, opponent than Roger bargained for.This plot goes over the top for black comedic effect, occasionally bordering on farce. Good writing and Morten Tyldum's deft direction combine with Aksel Hennie's terror and fighting spirit to pull this off. This could just be silly in other hands. But it's funny and suspenseful, with a selfish, insecure, sympathetic protagonist and a handsome, obsessed, almost cartoonish villain. Nicolaj Coster-Waldau is having fun being evil. ""Headhunters"" strengths are bizarre twists, one after another, that seem plausible enough but which no one, neither Roger nor the audience, could have predicted and the surprising mettle with which Roger meets these grim challenges. He seems surprised by his own determination and fortitude. The audience certainly is. But Roger keeps going and concocts a few surprises himself. Incidentally, Synnve Macody Lund, so alluring and natural onscreen, is not a professional actress. She's a Norwegian film critic.The DVD (Magnolia 2012): The film is primarily in Norwegian with optional English, English SDH, and Spanish subtitles. Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (2 min) and ""Behind the Scenes of Headhunters"" (22 min), which offers optional English subtitles. This featurette interviews director Morten Tyldum, cinematographer John Andreas Andersen, the film's producers, Aksel Hennie, and Synnve Macody Lund about the conception of the project, the challenge of working on a budget of only about $5.2 million, the characters of Roger and Clas, casting, the actors, filming the car crash, and more.",4,Energetic Norwegian Crime Thriller with Ample Humor and Gore.,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,2463,"['Headhunters', 'Hodejegeme', 'Norwegian', 'thriller', 'dark', 'comic', 'overtones', 'based', 'novel', 'Jo', 'Nesl', 'Roger', 'Brown', 'Aksel', 'Hennie', 'shrewd', 'corporate', 'headhunter', 'right', 'person', 'company', 'prospect', 'reputation', 'aggressive', 'attitude', 'unconventional', 'advice', 'also', 'short', 'financially', 'overextended', 'Roger', 'moonlights', 'art', 'thief', 'support', 'lavish', 'lifestyle', 'especially', 'impress', 'beautiful', 'statuesque', 'wife', 'Diana', 'Synnve', 'Macody', 'Lund', 'whom', 'always', 'fears', 'will', 'leave', 'someone', 'taller', 'richer', 'Desperate', 'cash', 'bank', 'account', 'overdrawn', 'Roger', 'score', 'big', 'target', 'conspicuously', 'charming', 'Dutchman', 'Clas', 'Greve', 'Nicolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'who', 'harboring', 'Reubens', 'painting', 'Oslo', 'apartment', 'Greve', 'Special', 'Ops', 'veteran', 'ruthless', 'CEO', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'more', 'formidable', 'more', 'violent', 'opponent', 'Roger', 'bargained', 'for.This', 'plot', 'top', 'black', 'comedic', 'effect', 'occasionally', 'bordering', 'farce', 'Good', 'writing', 'Morten', 'Tyldum', 'deft', 'direction', 'combine', 'Aksel', 'Hennie', 'terror', 'fighting', 'spirit', 'pull', 'off', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'silly', 'other', 'hands', 'funny', 'suspenseful', 'selfish', 'insecure', 'sympathetic', 'protagonist', 'handsome', 'obsessed', 'almost', 'cartoonish', 'villain', 'Nicolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'having', 'fun', 'being', 'evil', 'Headhunters', 'strengths', 'are', 'bizarre', 'twists', 'one', 'seem', 'plausible', 'enough', 'one', 'Roger', 'audience', 'could', 'have', 'predicted', 'surprising', 'mettle', 'Roger', 'grim', 'challenges', 'surprised', 'own', 'determination', 'fortitude', 'audience', 'certainly', 'Roger', 'going', 'few', 'surprises', 'Incidentally', 'Synnve', 'Macody', 'Lund', 'alluring', 'natural', 'onscreen', 'not', 'professional', 'actress', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'critic.The', 'DVD', 'Magnolia', '2012', 'film', 'primarily', 'Norwegian', 'optional', 'English', 'English', 'SDH', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'theatrical', 'trailer', '2', 'min', 'Scenes', 'Headhunters', '22', 'min', 'optional', 'English', 'subtitles', 'featurette', 'interviews', 'director', 'Morten', 'Tyldum', 'cinematographer', 'John', 'Andreas', 'Andersen', 'film', 'producers', 'Aksel', 'Hennie', 'Synnve', 'Macody', 'Lund', 'conception', 'project', 'challenge', 'working', 'budget', 'only', '5.2', 'million', 'characters', 'Roger', 'Clas', 'casting', 'actors', 'filming', 'car', 'crash', 'more']",Headhunters
1541343,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0081HLM2E,M. Oleson,"[1, 2]","This Norwegian import was quite the pleasant surprise.  Combining the disturbing wit of the Coen Brothers, the mystery of Hitchcock and the in-your-face visceral gore of Sam Raimi, Morten Tyldum's film has enough twists and turns for any fan of the genre.Roger Brown (excellent Aksel Hennie) narrates his own story.  Although he is a successful corporate recruiter (headhunter), he has trouble making ends meet.  He's living over his head always trying to make an impression on his statuesque trophy-wife Diane (beautiful Synnove Macody Lund).  He lets the audience know that he's only 5' 6"" more than once.  He supports Diana's art gallery opening and is constantly paranoid about his wife's commitment.  To us it appears her only concern is that Roger refuses to discuss the idea of having children.Needing more income, Roger has a sideline.  He steals rare art (Diana unwittingly gives him information), replacing it with near perfect reproductions.  It turns out that one of Roger's potential clients, Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is known to have a valuable Renoir.  As Roger lifts the painting, he discovers his wife's phone in Clas's apartment.  Hmm.  This set up leads to a strong middle section of the film where Clas is hunting down Roger in an effort to kill him.This frankly doesn't make much sense, but it's a lot of fun to try to figure out why.  At the same time we see poor Roger go through a series of identity changes and escape mechanisms including one you won't forget any time soon.  This is a skillfully made, tension filled drama with just enough wickedness to make it a cut above.The Blu ray version of this film looks excellent.  Although I suspect it was shot on film, the 1080p transfer looks very digital-like.  That is, there is little if any grain.  As it takes place in cold Norway, the whites are bright and the sky is blue, very blue.  Excellent blacks as well.  You have 2 audio options, both DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.

1541347,A237RLQXTL55RG,B0081HLM2E,off the tropic,"[1, 1]","Scandinavian films have made their mark on the action film genre with Stieg Larsson's ""Millenium"" novels adapted to screen with wide commercial and critical success. Jo Nesbo's ""Head Hunters"", a thriller from Norway, filmed in Oslo and the outskirts, in a similar vein, offers plenty of action with that touch of the macabre that is getting to be staple Scandinavian fare.Synnve Macody Lund and Aksel Hennie, the two leads in the film, play Diana and Roger Brown, a couple living the high life in Norway. Roger is a headhunter with a supplementary vocation, kept secret from his wife, to help keep up their lifestyle. He is in the business of selling paintings that bring him massive returns. The price of these paintings are quite literally a steal for him and one particular business deal promises the lifestyle he has always been seeking for his wife. Oblivious of Roger's underground vocation, Diana seems to like their life. But there is a noticeable emptiness in her life. She tells her husband about her deeper interest in getting a family started. She often tries to get Roger to pay less attention to work, and more attention to their home, their future together as a couple.Roger's voice overs reveal a man tragically caught up in the illusion of devoting himself entirely to the business of making a living, even if it comes at the cost of alienating his wife. He assumes that Diana's interest in their marriage is reduced to her regard for the high life he has created for them. These introspective voice overs, reveals Roger's fears more clearly. The perception that his beautiful wife will move on in her life with someone else eventually rules his life. We now suspect that his get rich schemes behind her back may only be a reflection of his insecurities. He fails to see the obvious: Diana's needs and interests lie closer to home.Synnve Macody Lund as Diana Brown is a remarkable debut performance. She has a screen presence that is reminiscent of Grace Kelly at her finest (I am thinking of her performance in ""Rear Window"" as the glamour woman who is also uncompromisingly devoted to her partner). She has that rare combination of stunning beauty and earnestness that matches the grace of the Hollywood legend. Hennie plays the smug, sophisticated Roger Brown, rapidly spiraling out of control as his seemingly fool proof scheme and living beyond his means, unravels when he meets his match in Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau).The writing and direction are consistently impressive. The film is finely crafted and has the style, snap, and grit of a vintage Don Siegel 1970s action film. Siegel's ""Coogan's Buff"" and ""Dirty Harry"" are its ancestors. The crisp rapid pace of ""Head Hunters"" is one noticeable virtue of the film. The film's polished self-conscious style also packs quite a punch with its  unsettling, gritty realism. There are genuine shocks to be found here for even the most seasoned action film audiences.Hennie is making quite a reputation for himself as an actor in Scandinavia and the wider international film scene, and rightly so. His role here as Roger Brown, husband, businessman, and swindler, conjures up the image of Hollywood actor, James Spader, who briefly came to prominence in the late eighties and early nineties.This thriller from Oslo is another representative of the grand cultural turn in the history of Scandinavian film.

Roger Brown, who is in the recruiting business (hence the movie's title), but in order to keep up his lavish life style and to continually impress his impossibly beautiful wife Diana, Roger has a side business of sorts: he, with the aide of a side kick, steals valuable art from people's homes, to sell it on the black market. All goes well until at some point Roger meets Dutch business man Clas Greve. Clas has an interesting background and might fit the profile for the CEO position that Roger's headhunting agency is trying to fill. On top of that, Clas' grandmother, who just passed away in Oslo, apparently has some extremely valuable art in her private collection...The above is the basic premise of the movie, and to give away much more would flat-out ruin your viewing experience. Suffice it to say that not everything is what it seems to be. From the movie's beginning, the pace is relentless, and I was on the edge of my seat for much of the movie (as were most of the fellow theatre visitors I saw it with this past weekend). Indeed, there is hardly any ""down"" time in the movie, because once the basic premise of the movie is set, we fall from one surprise into the next, without it being ""over the top"" or implausible.When this movie came out in Norway last year, it immediately was a box office smash, and that success was later repeated in many European countries. Now it's finally in the US, and by all means it should do well here to. Even though it was made in a different country than the Dragon Tattoo trilogy, ""Headhunters"" definitely has a similar feel about it, albeit never quite as dark as the Dragon Tattoo trilogy. In all, this movie has been one of the best surprises for me among the theatre movie releases I've seen so far in 2012.

1541369,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B0081HLM2E,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","After watching Headhunters for the second time in two months, I feel compelled to review it. I know that most of you will never see it because it's subtitled, and that's a huge shame. I'm not sure how many thousands of movies I have watched over the years, but this may be the most original script I have ever seen. I don't say that lightly, I can assure you.Although I know I must review the movie, I also don't want to tell you anything about it at all. It's too surprising to be ruined by a review that gives away any of its many revelations.So what can I tell you?Roger Brown is 5'6"" tall and has a wife who is beautiful, successful, and several inches taller than him. She's about to open her own art gallery. He's insecure and almost sure that she'll eventually leave him, so he tries to compensate by giving her expensive gifts and living in a house that is out of his price range. He works as a headhunter, placing people in high-powered jobs, but he supplements his income by stealing paintings.We are shown how Brown carefully uses his main job to select potential targets for his criminal activities. His accomplice, Ove (Sander) works in security, and helps Brown disable alarms. Brown dreams of the day that he steals something valuable enough to enable him to change his life forever, and an opportunity presents itself when Clas Greve (Coster-Waldau) tells Brown's wife that he owns a Rubens.I don't want to reveal any more plot points.Aksel Hennie looks like a more refined version of Steve Buscemi, and has the same sort of charm. Even though he's a criminal, it's hard not to root for him. Some of the situations that he finds himself in are bizarre, but his actions seem logical and intelligent under the circumstances.The movie is based on Jo Nesb's novel. I sometimes watch successful movies, such as Avatar, and sit there wondering how such a predictable plot ever ended up being made into a movie. I'm certain that I could do better. But if I had written Headhunters, I would be extremely proud. You won't be able to predict many of the twists and turns taken by this plot. It's nothing short of genius.I saw some great films in 2012, but even though there was a Tarantino release, and several others worth 4.5 or 5/5, I don't think anything surpassed Headhunters in terms of sheer enjoyment. If you are open to subtitled films, this is a must. If you aren't, maybe this can be your first. An American remake appears to be scheduled for next year. Your other choice is to learn Norwegian. It would almost be worth the effort.",5,Perhaps the most original plot I have ever witnessed,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,2548,"['watching', 'Headhunters', 'second', 'time', 'two', 'months', 'feel', 'compelled', 'review', 'know', 'most', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'subtitled', 'huge', 'shame', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'thousands', 'movies', 'have', 'watched', 'years', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'original', 'script', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'lightly', 'can', 'assure', 'know', 'must', 'review', 'movie', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'tell', 'anything', 'too', 'surprising', 'be', 'ruined', 'review', 'away', 'many', 'revelations.So', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'Roger', 'Brown', '5', '6', 'tall', 'wife', 'who', 'beautiful', 'successful', 'several', 'inches', 'taller', 'open', 'own', 'art', 'gallery', 'insecure', 'almost', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'eventually', 'leave', 'so', 'compensate', 'giving', 'expensive', 'gifts', 'living', 'house', 'price', 'range', 'headhunter', 'placing', 'people', 'high-powered', 'jobs', 'income', 'stealing', 'paintings.We', 'are', 'shown', 'how', 'Brown', 'carefully', 'main', 'job', 'select', 'potential', 'targets', 'criminal', 'activities', 'accomplice', 'Ove', 'Sander', 'security', 'Brown', 'disable', 'alarms', 'Brown', 'dreams', 'day', 'something', 'valuable', 'enough', 'enable', 'change', 'life', 'forever', 'opportunity', 'when', 'Clas', 'Greve', 'Coster-Waldau', 'Brown', 'wife', 'Rubens.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'more', 'plot', 'points.Aksel', 'Hennie', 'more', 'refined', 'version', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'same', 'sort', 'charm', 'Even', 'criminal', 'hard', 'not', 'root', 'situations', 'are', 'bizarre', 'actions', 'seem', 'logical', 'intelligent', 'circumstances.The', 'movie', 'based', 'Jo', 'Nesb', 'novel', 'sometimes', 'watch', 'successful', 'movies', 'such', 'Avatar', 'sit', 'there', 'wondering', 'how', 'such', 'predictable', 'plot', 'ever', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'made', 'movie', ""'m"", 'certain', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'had', 'written', 'Headhunters', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'proud', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'predict', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'taken', 'plot', 'nothing', 'short', 'genius.I', 'saw', 'great', 'films', '2012', 'even', 'was', 'Tarantino', 'release', 'several', 'others', 'worth', '4.5', '5/5', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'surpassed', 'Headhunters', 'terms', 'sheer', 'enjoyment', 'are', 'open', 'subtitled', 'films', 'must', 'are', ""n't"", 'maybe', 'can', 'be', 'first', 'American', 'remake', 'be', 'scheduled', 'next', 'year', 'other', 'choice', 'learn', 'Norwegian', 'would', 'almost', 'be', 'effort']",Headhunters

Living in a fancy house with his beautiful wife Diana (Synnve Macody Lund), Roger Brown thinks his life is going well until he breaks into a certain person's apartment where Roger discovers something that strongly suggests his life was not perfect after all.The situation goes from bad to worse when Roger realizes he is being hunted down by someone - someone holding a gun with a malicious intent.

The scene when he starts piecing the situation together in the river is particularly moving. It is so much better and believable than the usual unbelievable ""victim suddenly becomes hero"" turnaround that we get with Hollywood movies.Yes, the film omits a few elements of the book, such as the nature of the relationship between Clas and Lotte, and speeds through others, but the overall storyline is kept true.Overall a great film that will have you on the edge of your chair, even without having read the book.One personal recommendation - watch it in the original Norwegian with English subtitles.

1541379,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B0081HLM2E,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[4, 7]","Headhunters (Hodejegerne) is a taut Norwegian-German thriller that, in its best parts, is reminiscent in style not only of the Coen brothers but also of Alfred Hitchcock as well.  Directed by Morten Tyldum and adapted by Lars Gudmestad and Ulf Ryberg from the novel by Jo Nesb, Headhunters starts off casually with what seems to be an art thief explaining why he does what he does.  But just when you think you know what's going on and where things are heading, the film starts taking one unexpected turn after another, methodically ratcheting up the tension and the stakes, until you, like the art thief, are wondering just what the hell you've gotten yourself into.Set in current-day Oslo, Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) is one of the top professional headhunters in Norway, assisting top-name companies find the very best in executive talent.  It's a good job and it pays well, but unfortunately not well enough to support the extravagant lifestyle Roger lavishes on himself and on his wife of seven years, Diana (Synnve Macody Lund).  Which is why Roger is also one of the top art thieves in Norway; he needs the money to keep up the lifestyle that his regular job cannot support.  He freely acknowledges, in his inner narrative to the audience, that he's probably compensating for the fact that he's short (1.68m or 5'6"") and ordinary-looking where his wife is tall and beautiful.  And because of his insecurities, he's constantly giving her expensive gifts - like financing the new art gallery she's opening - but stubbornly ignoring the one thing she really wants from him: a child.  But at the same time he's also having an affair with a woman named Lotte (Julie lgaard).  He knows it's probably a bad idea, but his doubts about his wife's love leave him in need of still further validation.Fortunately for Roger, his work with top-name companies and high-level executives is always bringing him into contact with the kind of people who like to indulge in expensive art, so he is able to use his day job to find suitable targets for his secret sideline.  He also has a valuable if distinctly unrefined partner named Ove Kjikerud (Eivind Sander) who works for the home-security company that most people use and who can enable him to get in and out of the target houses without triggering the alarms. The pressure of maintaining this lifestyle, however, is enormous, and so Roger must constantly pull one job after another, pointing out how the theft he pulls off early in the film won't even cover this month's mortgage payment on his expensive house once the middlemen take their cut and his partner Ove gets his cut. So he's excited when a juicy double-plum suddenly drops right into his lap.Roger's current big client is a hi-tech security company called Pathfinder who is looking for a new CEO.  And so when, at his wife's gallery opening, she introduces him to a man named Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), he quickly realizes that Clas, a former special forces commando and security expert who until just recently was working as an executive for Pathfinder's biggest rival, is the perfect match for the job.  And when he finds out that Clas is apparently in possession of a lost Rubens - a painting potentially worth millions - Roger sees the answer to all of his financial problems.But then things start to go wrong.  And then more wrong.  And then horribly, horribly wrong.(Note:  I'm trying to avoid any major spoilers, but there are a few potential ones in this paragraph.)When Roger slips into Clas' apartment to get the Rubens, he makes a discovery that throws his entire world into disarray.  Which provokes him into a fit of pique and makes him sabotage Clas' chances for the Pathfinder CEO job.  Which somehow triggers something and the next thing he knows he's finding an apparently dead body in his car, and then he's running for his life, thinking Clas must've realized he'd stolen the Rubens... only to discover that Clas isn't after the Rubens at all.  And at every turn, people around him are either getting killed, or trying to kill him, or both.The performances are all top notch, from Aksel Hennie's outwardly super-confident but inwardly insecure Roger to Eivind Sander's clownishly crude Ove who obsesses over the Russian prostitute he spends all of his money on and who uses security cameras in his house to let his buddies at the security company watch some of the fun now and then.  Synnve Macody Lund's Diana is layered, leaving the audience as well as Roger wondering what she knows and whose side she is truly on. Julie lgaard's Lotte turns on a dime, going from earthy erotic to neurotically needy to the completely unexpected as her character's role in the drama changes.  The standout performance though comes from Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known to English-speaking audiences as the casually amoral and dangerous Jamie Lannister from the Game Of Thrones TV mini-series.  In Headhunters, Coster-Waldau's Clas is charming from the beginning, but even then you can sense that beneath that charm is something else, something calculating and, as events begin to unfold, tenacious, controlled and deadly.It's the cat-and-mouse game between Roger and Clas that really rivets you, heightened by Hennie's bringing out Roger's increasing fear, confusion and desperation while Coster-Waldau reveals the relentless dispassionate predator in Clas.  The tension just keeps getting racheted up higher and higher, with Clas resorting to more and more extreme measures to get Roger and Roger resorting to equally extreme measures to survive.  Tyldum does an excellent job with the pacing and with the twists and turns in the plot that keep you guessing as to what will happen next and how things will finally be resolved.  Stylistically, a lot of Headhunters reminded me of films by the Coen brothers where all of the details matter and how actions can have the most unintended consequences.  It also reminded me a lot of Hitchcock in the way that his protagonists often got swept up in events where they must struggle to find out what's going on even as they try to stay alive.My only real complaint about Headhunters is that I felt the ending wrapped things up just a little too neatly to be believable, and that the characters who survive at the end got off way, way too lightly.  One of the things I like about the Coen brothers' films is that no matter what the game is or how it ends, nobody gets to walk away with all of the chips.  Headhunters could have used a bit of that philosophy.  If I could've rated it four-and-a-half stars I would've, but the too-neat ending kept me from giving it the full five.But that aside, Headhunters is a really well-done thriller that keeps the tension and the stakes mounting higher and higher almost to the very end.

It suffers from not making it clear that the central character of the burglar is quick thinking and imaginative. The chase scenes are fairly exciting but at some point it becomes unbelievable. It is heartless assassin stuff.Where the King of this genre isThe Day of the Jackalas well as the connection with real life events in France at that time, that film is also beautifully paced. Plenty of room for the viewer to get to know the assassin. Can we really condemn this professional man for his killings? He only kills when he is threatened, after all. The rich woman in bed is a masterpiece of dueling sympathies. A film I watch many times.The Headhunters is nowhere near this level. The film propels itself from one chase scene to another. They are often ingenious action sequences but ultimately the film is perilously close to comic book with some unbelievable twists.

Everything about this Norske import reeks of drama, tension, passion, and excitement; and some of it smells of sweet absurdity.The creators of the script and executors of the film never lost sight of what is the ultimate goal of any movie:  Entertainment!Almost every second of this movie propels the story forward in such a way that the viewer becomes entirely enamored of this story, and the action propelling it is so frenetic and compelling that it pulls all manner of reaction from its audience from lust, to ridicule, to shock, to revulsion, to laughter, to admiration all of which keep one riveted to the screen.  For nobody wishes to miss a single second of this action-packed mystery thriller.I'm not going to give the plot away, likely other reviewers have done this for you, other to say that this is an action-packed mystery thriller that throws in all of the elements that Hollywood deems necessary for a successful action-packed mystery thriller and does it in such a cleverly nonchalant self-conscious way that one is charmed in the very process of identifying it all (gratuitous breast, impossible action, vulgar sexual content--a peculiarity of contemporary Norwegian film, incidentally--, blood and gore, right down to a trite romantic interlude).Yes, all of the Hollywood cliche strings are tossed in front of the audience and amazingly none of them are left dangling untied at the end of the show.If, at the very end of this movie, you don't have a huge grin of satisfaction on your face, you aren't a sentient being, my friend.",5,Genius!,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,1629,"['Quite', 'simply', 'quintessential', 'cinematic', 'thriller', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'Everything', 'Norske', 'import', 'reeks', 'drama', 'tension', 'passion', 'excitement', 'sweet', 'absurdity.The', 'creators', 'script', 'executors', 'film', 'never', 'lost', 'sight', 'what', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'movie', 'Entertainment', 'second', 'movie', 'story', 'forward', 'such', 'way', 'viewer', 'entirely', 'enamored', 'story', 'action', 'propelling', 'so', 'frenetic', 'compelling', 'manner', 'reaction', 'audience', 'lust', 'ridicule', 'shock', 'revulsion', 'laughter', 'admiration', 'keep', 'one', 'riveted', 'screen', 'nobody', 'wishes', 'miss', 'single', 'second', 'action-packed', 'mystery', 'thriller.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'plot', 'away', 'likely', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'other', 'say', 'action-packed', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'elements', 'Hollywood', 'necessary', 'successful', 'action-packed', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'cleverly', 'nonchalant', 'self-conscious', 'way', 'one', 'charmed', 'very', 'process', 'identifying', 'gratuitous', 'breast', 'impossible', 'action', 'vulgar', 'sexual', 'content', 'peculiarity', 'contemporary', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'incidentally', 'blood', 'gore', 'right', 'down', 'trite', 'romantic', 'interlude', '.Yes', 'Hollywood', 'cliche', 'strings', 'are', 'tossed', 'front', 'audience', 'amazingly', 'none', 'are', 'left', 'dangling', 'untied', 'end', 'show.If', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', 'grin', 'satisfaction', 'face', 'are', ""n't"", 'sentient', 'being', 'friend']",Headhunters
