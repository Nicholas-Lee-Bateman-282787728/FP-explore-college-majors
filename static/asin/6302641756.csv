324413,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,6302641756,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[7, 7]","Steve McQueen is still admired today. Like Marilyn Monroe and James Dean his talent has been recognized well beyond his years on the big screen. I grew up while he was alive and always loved his movies. He was excellent in a several dramas including ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Great Escape"", but not many people have seen his comedic side. ""The Honeymoon Machine"" is probably his best role that showed his ability to do comedy. The support cast with stars like Jim Hutton, Paula Prentiss, and Dean Jagger is great. Richard Thorpe does an excellent job of directing.When Lt. Howard, played by McQueen, plots a method to beat the casino using the Navies ship computer, things get interesting. Two other seamen join him in his plan to outwit the casino and when their girlfriends get caught up in the scheme, things get very funny. When McQueen's girlfriend that is an Admirals daughter tries to find out what is going on things get crazy. Then the Admiral thinks there is a subversive plot against the Navy, and the plan really goes haywire. This is a screwball comedy that the whole family can enjoy. Fans of movies like ""The Wackiest Ship in the Army"" and ""Operation Petticoat"" should love it. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys old or new comedies. I hope they put this on DVD soon.",4,McQueen comedy at its best,1110585600,"03 12, 2005",2005,1291,"['Steve', 'McQueen', 'still', 'admired', 'today', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'James', 'Dean', 'talent', 'been', 'recognized', 'well', 'years', 'big', 'screen', 'grew', 'up', 'was', 'alive', 'always', 'loved', 'movies', 'was', 'excellent', 'several', 'dramas', 'including', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'Great', 'Escape', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'comedic', 'side', 'Honeymoon', 'Machine', 'probably', 'best', 'role', 'showed', 'ability', 'do', 'comedy', 'support', 'cast', 'stars', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'Paula', 'Prentiss', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'great', 'Richard', 'Thorpe', 'excellent', 'job', 'directing.When', 'Lt.', 'Howard', 'played', 'McQueen', 'method', 'beat', 'casino', 'using', 'Navies', 'ship', 'computer', 'things', 'get', 'interesting', 'Two', 'other', 'seamen', 'join', 'plan', 'outwit', 'casino', 'when', 'girlfriends', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'scheme', 'things', 'get', 'very', 'funny', 'When', 'McQueen', 'girlfriend', 'Admirals', 'daughter', 'tries', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'things', 'get', 'crazy', 'Then', 'Admiral', 'thinks', 'subversive', 'plot', 'Navy', 'plan', 'really', 'haywire', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Fans', 'movies', 'Wackiest', 'Ship', 'Army', 'Operation', 'Petticoat', 'should', 'love', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'old', 'new', 'comedies', 'hope', 'put', 'DVD', 'soon']",Honeymoon Machine VHS

The plot concerns three navy men who concoct a get rich scheme involving a Casino, a signal machine, the city of Venice, and a Supercomputer.The plan seems fool-proof, but then two women get involved, the head of the Navy shows up, the signal machine falls into the canal, and a Martian-fearing sailor throws a wrench in the works. The actors are all game (especially McQueen, who is surprisingly funny), and the script is witty and occasionally hilarious. The Venice locations are also very nice.

324419,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,6302641756,Jack E. Levic,"[1, 1]","Steve McQueen is not known for his comedic roles so THE HONEYMOON MACHINE is a chance to see a different side of Steve McQueen. This is a silly but fun and pleasant comedy. A group of sailors connive to win at a casino in Venice, Italy with the help of a new computer on their ship. Sailors on shore and on the ship communicate with light blinkers that suddenly have the Russians and Americans in an uproar over what appears to be some sort of coded message for an attack. Totally silly plot but fun. Most of McQueen's comedy is from his facial expressions and how he tends to overpronouce his words.Another fun part of the film is seeing familiar faces in the cast. Some of these actors I have seen through the years in TV roles but here they are young and fresh at the start of their careers. Lovely Paula Prentiss was such a mainstay in films in the 60's and here she is early in her career. Another actor who went on to bigger things is Jim Hutton.The standout in this comedy is Jack Weston. Years later he appeared with Steve McQueen in the drama THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR and again he was the standout in the film. Weston uses his comedic talents to the max as the sailor sent to investigate ""the blinker"" seen from the hotel. McQueen's gang offers him some liquor and Weston plays a hilarious drunk afraid of Martians. (Martians? Well, that is another story.)Although THE HONEYMOON MACHINE is far from the perfect comedy, it does have charm and it is fun to see some classic actors working together. Sometimes we all need a bit of fun silliness and THE HONEYMOON MACHINE is worth the time.",4,SILLY BUT FUN FILM RARE STEVE MCQUEEN COMEDY,1342742400,"07 20, 2012",2012,1594,"['Steve', 'McQueen', 'not', 'known', 'comedic', 'roles', 'THE', 'HONEYMOON', 'MACHINE', 'chance', 'see', 'different', 'side', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'silly', 'fun', 'pleasant', 'comedy', 'group', 'sailors', 'connive', 'win', 'casino', 'Venice', 'Italy', 'help', 'new', 'computer', 'ship', 'Sailors', 'shore', 'ship', 'communicate', 'light', 'blinkers', 'suddenly', 'have', 'Russians', 'Americans', 'uproar', 'what', 'be', 'sort', 'coded', 'message', 'attack', 'Totally', 'silly', 'plot', 'fun', 'Most', 'McQueen', 'comedy', 'facial', 'expressions', 'how', 'overpronouce', 'words.Another', 'fun', 'part', 'film', 'seeing', 'familiar', 'cast', 'actors', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'TV', 'roles', 'here', 'are', 'young', 'fresh', 'start', 'careers', 'Lovely', 'Paula', 'Prentiss', 'was', 'such', 'mainstay', 'films', '60', 'here', 'early', 'career', 'actor', 'who', 'went', 'bigger', 'things', 'Jim', 'Hutton.The', 'standout', 'comedy', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'Years', 'later', 'appeared', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'drama', 'THE', 'THOMAS', 'CROWN', 'AFFAIR', 'again', 'was', 'standout', 'film', 'Weston', 'comedic', 'talents', 'max', 'sailor', 'sent', 'investigate', 'blinker', 'seen', 'hotel', 'McQueen', 'gang', 'liquor', 'Weston', 'hilarious', 'drunk', 'afraid', 'Martians', 'Martians', 'Well', 'story', 'THE', 'HONEYMOON', 'MACHINE', 'far', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'have', 'charm', 'fun', 'see', 'classic', 'actors', 'working', 'together', 'Sometimes', 'need', 'bit', 'fun', 'silliness', 'THE', 'HONEYMOON', 'MACHINE', 'time']",Honeymoon Machine VHS
