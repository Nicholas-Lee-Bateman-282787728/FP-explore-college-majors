They just don't make corny college movies like this anymore.  On par with the original revenge of the nerds, this is set in a different university other than Adams...Busterburger University.  A young man who has been kicked out of 4 universities is forced to find a place that will accept him, and give him a university diploma in order to inherit $250,000.  Then it flashes across the TV...""Glory Buster Burger Lou Ya!""...and off to Busterburger University it is for him.  Along the way, he learns the values of friends, leadership, loyalty, and oh yes..self control from girls.  Pick this flick up.  It is full of one liners, catch phrases, and the wonderful acting by Dick Butkis amongst others.

206606,AREUUNVSKKODF,630018952X,"John T. Ehrhart ""JohnOfKaty""","[8, 8]","First off, I love this movie but, I think it's the CORNIEST movie I ever saw.  I never saw it in the theater BUT, when I saw it come on HBO I had to tape it for myself.  What's really funny is the doctor with his high powered prescription glasses that magnify his eyes and when he takes them off, he purposely rolls his eyes back to make you think his eyes came off with the glasses.The cast is really hilarious.  Leigh McCloskey plays this sex maniac could be college throw if he doesn't control his hormones somebody who every time he gets around females, he's already making out with them.  It starts out in a girls sorority and he's in the shower with a student (female of course).  And right away he's caught by one of his professors.  So he gets sent to his shrink to find out what he can do to resolve his problem.  Within a matter minutes he's hypnotized by her looks, she takes off her top, and reveals her breasts and he's making out with her.  He gets suspended from that college and then he decides to go to Busterburger University.  Dick Butkis, a former football player and coach plays Drill Sgt. Drewton a guy who starts out hating Russell Procope (McCloskey) all because he's messing around with his fiancee' Mia Vunk (Debbie Blee) the daughter of the owner of Busterburger U Lymon Vunk (Charles Tyner). During the whole movie, he tries his best to make sure the students fail so that he can get that position on the executive board that he brags to Mia so much about but, loses in the end.  Russell's team in the franchaising exam passes and they all graduate.  Some of the cast members you'll see are quite lame and names you've never even heard of and of course you'll hear Busterburger's stupid little jingle and gets quite boring and once you've heard it, you'll never get it out of your head.  I would love to see this movie come out as a RErelease on DVD for those who can't seem to play it anymore on VHS so if the manufacterer has ownership of it, maybe they'll see my post and see that I love the movie and maybe make a DVD out of it.There isn't that much making on VHS of this title so if any of you still have it, God bless you keep it and never lose it you won't want to ever lose it. The other favorite scene is the part where the Fabulous 400 on a tour bus comes into the Busterburger establishment and all these overweight people start making pigs of themselves until Russell's team spikes their Buster shakes with INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH LAXATIVE and then they all start breaking wind and passing gas.  And it takes them to the only restroom the restaurant has and a Japanese man is in it doing his business with a 35mm camera attached to his neck is reading a magazine.  When the breaking wind WORSENS, the Japanese man takes pictures and the flash ignites the passing gases and explode the building where the bathroom was.  I thought that was HILARIOUS!!! So if you guys still have this VHS it is a keeper!John",5,Hamburger The Motion Picture,1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,2941,"['First', 'love', 'movie', 'think', 'CORNIEST', 'movie', 'ever', 'saw', 'never', 'saw', 'theater', 'BUT', 'when', 'saw', 'come', 'HBO', 'had', 'tape', 'What', 'really', 'funny', 'doctor', 'high', 'powered', 'prescription', 'glasses', 'magnify', 'eyes', 'when', 'off', 'purposely', 'eyes', 'back', 'make', 'think', 'eyes', 'came', 'off', 'glasses.The', 'cast', 'really', 'hilarious', 'Leigh', 'McCloskey', 'sex', 'maniac', 'could', 'be', 'college', 'throw', ""n't"", 'control', 'hormones', 'somebody', 'who', 'time', 'females', 'already', 'making', 'out', 'out', 'girls', 'sorority', 'shower', 'student', 'female', 'course', 'right', 'away', 'caught', 'one', 'professors', 'So', 'sent', 'shrink', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'resolve', 'problem', 'matter', 'minutes', 'hypnotized', 'looks', 'top', 'breasts', 'making', 'out', 'suspended', 'college', 'then', 'go', 'Busterburger', 'University', 'Dick', 'Butkis', 'former', 'football', 'player', 'coach', 'plays', 'Drill', 'Sgt', 'Drewton', 'guy', 'who', 'out', 'hating', 'Russell', 'Procope', 'McCloskey', 'messing', 'around', 'fiancee', 'Mia', 'Vunk', 'Debbie', 'Blee', 'daughter', 'owner', 'Busterburger', 'U', 'Lymon', 'Vunk', 'Charles', 'Tyner', 'whole', 'movie', 'best', 'make', 'sure', 'students', 'fail', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'position', 'executive', 'board', 'Mia', 'so', 'much', 'end', 'Russell', 'team', 'franchaising', 'exam', 'passes', 'graduate', 'cast', 'members', ""'ll"", 'see', 'are', 'quite', 'lame', 'names', ""'ve"", 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'course', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'Busterburger', 'stupid', 'little', 'jingle', 'quite', 'boring', 'once', ""'ve"", 'heard', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'head', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'RErelease', 'DVD', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'play', 'anymore', 'VHS', 'so', 'manufacterer', 'ownership', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'see', 'post', 'see', 'love', 'movie', 'maybe', 'make', 'DVD', 'it.There', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'making', 'VHS', 'title', 'so', 'still', 'have', 'God', 'bless', 'keep', 'never', 'lose', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'ever', 'lose', 'other', 'favorite', 'scene', 'part', 'where', 'Fabulous', '400', 'tour', 'bus', 'Busterburger', 'establishment', 'overweight', 'people', 'start', 'making', 'pigs', 'Russell', 'team', 'Buster', 'shakes', 'INDUSTRIAL', 'STRENGTH', 'LAXATIVE', 'then', 'start', 'breaking', 'wind', 'passing', 'gas', 'only', 'restroom', 'restaurant', 'Japanese', 'man', 'doing', 'business', '35mm', 'camera', 'attached', 'neck', 'reading', 'magazine', 'When', 'breaking', 'wind', 'WORSENS', 'Japanese', 'man', 'pictures', 'flash', 'passing', 'gases', 'explode', 'building', 'where', 'bathroom', 'was', 'thought', 'was', 'HILARIOUS', 'So', 'guys', 'still', 'have', 'VHS', 'keeper', 'John']",N/A

Finally a couple years ago I got a chance to purchase a copy of this film, and it's still hilarious. Buster Burger university, an institute of higher learning in Burgeroloy.  A bunch of societies wash outs get a chance to turn their lives around with higher education to become managment at a Buster Burger Franchise.  As with classic b-movies of the eighties, nudity and crude humor run wild.  But, How can you forget the buster burger clap, or the theme song ""america you're getting burger hungry"".  A must see, just don't overanalyze it, its a silly comedy, and just funny. It also starts Dick Butkus as the drill sargent, probably the reason he never went much farther in the film industry.
