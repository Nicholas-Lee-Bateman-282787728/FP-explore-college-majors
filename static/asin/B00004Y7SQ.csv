558643,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00004Y7SQ,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[16, 19]","This documentary is essential to understand one side of American history, the possible union between the dispossessed Indians and the enslaved Blacks. This union never really succeeded, but the two blood lines intertwined because of marriages and various solidarities. Some Blacks escaped slavery by joining some Indians tribes and some children of the marriages of Blacks and Indians became very important and successful in American society. The descendants of these Black Indians still play an important role in American society. They got involved in the Civil Rights movement, led by the Blacks. And then they got involved in the Native-American movement that is still at work to permit these Native Americans to be recognized and accepted by American society. They had difficult periods in recent history because they were neither Black not Indians and they suffered the rejection by the Caucasians most of the time into the Black ethnic group, and yet they were not easily accepted in the Black community because they were not pure Blacks. The new generation that is born from them has to assume two cultural and ethnic backgrounds and this is very difficult. But this new generation is going to be the crossroads of the two ethnic and cultural lines and they can become the agents of an alliance between the two communities, which will represent a heavy argument for the opening of American society to diversity and to humane change. This alliance, that should not be closed to other cultural or ethnic groups, can push for a social evolution that could lead to a step forward in civilization, an example to the world how the joining of different cultural or ethnic groups can enrich each group and humanity as a whole. The future of humanity is in the crisscrossing of different cultural and ethnic lines in the respect and pride of each individual component.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan",5,Black and Indian are Beautiful,1059782400,"08 2, 2003",2003,1912,"['documentary', 'essential', 'understand', 'one', 'side', 'American', 'history', 'possible', 'union', 'dispossessed', 'Indians', 'enslaved', 'Blacks', 'union', 'never', 'really', 'succeeded', 'two', 'blood', 'lines', 'intertwined', 'marriages', 'various', 'solidarities', 'Blacks', 'escaped', 'slavery', 'joining', 'Indians', 'tribes', 'children', 'marriages', 'Blacks', 'Indians', 'became', 'very', 'important', 'successful', 'American', 'society', 'descendants', 'Black', 'Indians', 'still', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'American', 'society', 'got', 'involved', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'led', 'Blacks', 'then', 'got', 'involved', 'Native-American', 'movement', 'still', 'work', 'permit', 'Native', 'Americans', 'be', 'recognized', 'accepted', 'American', 'society', 'had', 'difficult', 'periods', 'recent', 'history', 'were', 'Black', 'not', 'Indians', 'suffered', 'rejection', 'Caucasians', 'most', 'time', 'Black', 'ethnic', 'group', 'yet', 'were', 'not', 'easily', 'accepted', 'Black', 'community', 'were', 'not', 'pure', 'Blacks', 'new', 'generation', 'born', 'assume', 'two', 'cultural', 'ethnic', 'backgrounds', 'very', 'difficult', 'new', 'generation', 'going', 'be', 'crossroads', 'two', 'ethnic', 'cultural', 'lines', 'can', 'become', 'agents', 'alliance', 'two', 'communities', 'will', 'represent', 'heavy', 'argument', 'opening', 'American', 'society', 'diversity', 'humane', 'change', 'alliance', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'closed', 'other', 'cultural', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'can', 'push', 'social', 'evolution', 'could', 'lead', 'step', 'forward', 'civilization', 'example', 'world', 'how', 'joining', 'different', 'cultural', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'can', 'enrich', 'group', 'humanity', 'whole', 'future', 'humanity', 'crisscrossing', 'different', 'cultural', 'ethnic', 'lines', 'respect', 'pride', 'individual', 'component.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Perpignan']",N/A

After doing some reading and research on American Indians, I have become more proud of my Cherokee Indian heritage than my so called African heritage(due to the fact Indians have suffered the worst oppression in our country and for a black man to embrace or find his ancestry other than African is still considered wrong in the black community). Even by the dvd's admittance, it is the black community as a whole frowns on those blacks who embrace their mixed blood ancestry. I for one am proud of all my ancestry, which Cherokee Indian and black on my father's side and white, Asian Indian and black on my mother's side. I don't buy this one drop black blood rule and I personally would like to thank the creators of this dvd as well as Tiger Woods for standing up against the status quo in the black community.
