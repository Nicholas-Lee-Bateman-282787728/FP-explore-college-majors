904136,A2Y47HN5IP85J,B0009E32VG,M. Richardson,"[1, 1]","I recently watched the full length of the anime series Infinite Ryvius, and am now very disappointed that it took me so long to discover it. While most anime simply sink into a sea of mediocrity, Ryvius, which was made in the late nineties, is a treasure. It's engaging. It's hypnotic. It's intense. It's infuriating. It's funny. It's passionate. And more than anything else, it's illuminating.It is also pretty flawed. But we'll get to that.The series follows the story of hundreds of kids who manage to escape from a training center deep into the solar system on a training vessel after they're seemingly attacked by terrorists and the vessel's adult crew sacrifice their lives in order to slow its descent into the Geduld (a high-gravity phenomenon which appeared in space after a mysterious incident with the sun and is cloud-like in appearance). Following this, the students discover yet another ship, hidden until then, called the Ryvius, which might have mysterious powers. In the midst of chaos the students manage to mostly preserve the pre-existing social order (minus adults, obviously) aboard the ship. This is only initially, however. Soon the political situation on the ship shall change drastically as different groups of students lay claim on the bridge, and what emerges from this series might be called a ""sociological thriller."" The students are constantly being assaulted by outside threats, who have their own unknown agendas, and the social order is constantly rearranging itself when they notice a moment of weakness in the system, usually soon before or after an enemy attack. The coups and regaining of power by previously ousted groups goes on throughout the series, but as the mental stability of the student body, which has to deal with dwindling supplies, constant attacks from outside, and a deteriorating social order slowly crumbles, the political situation itself takes controversial and often alarming turns.There is also a lot going on under the surface of the series. Each student is psychologically complex, and the relationships between them are remarkably deep and unconventional. This is not a show which satiates itself with simple explanations. The characters are mostly fully-realized (the main ones, anyhow: come on, there are more than 200 students on board and this show is only 26 half-hour episodes, so the non-essential players are usually reduced down to one defining characteristic).The plot itself is almost entirely under the surface. This show makes a fetish out of mystery and relishes the fact that it can control how much information you're allowed at any one time. On one hand, this is good, as it makes things more engaging and frightening: we're rarely allowed to know more about the situation than the kids themselves. On the other hand, this series really wobbles between being captivating and obtuse.The animation is uneven. Nothing to speak of there.The voice acting is terrific in the original Japanese. I haven't watched the dub of this, so I can't talk about the English acting at all, although I suspect it is probably pretty terrible. Anyone who disagrees should feel free to disabuse me of this notion.The music is fairly sparse, which actually works in such a dialogue-heavy anime. Where it is present, though, it is enjoyable. Taking a different route than most anime soundtracks, this one has a very heavy hip-hop influence to it. The opening and ending themes are themselves excellent and have become two of my favorite pieces of anime music.Character interactions are what make this series work so well. Beyond the obvious interactions based on the characters' outward personas, more compelling are the more subtle peeks into the minds of these characters, with all their fears and neuroses. As the series goes on and the children on the Ryvius grow increasingly unhinged, these 'hidden' elements of their personalities come into full view. Some of these kids are seriously warped, and we get a very honest look into the minds of some characters.Now, on to the flaws:This series has a pretty steep learning curve. This is fine when details are communicated in a fashion that helps you understand things as they arise in the story, but whether through carelessness or through design, information is often not presented until an episode or two AFTER the thing it introduces is formally explained. Expect to be very confused for the first two or three episodes of this series, and then moderately confused throughout the rest of the series.My recommendation: don't think too deeply about the jargon used in the series (""sere,"" ""solids,"" etc.) What these things are and do can be figured out in the context of the situation, so it IS quite possible to follow the proceedings without getting lost, but if you do, don't despair. Just try to grasp the gist of the situation. I think most of the jargon is largely window-dressing.About twelve or thirteen episodes in, the creators take (in my estimation) a misstep by introducing giant robot battles into the series. The series until this point had managed to make the action compelling by allowing only minimal offensive power to the Ryvius. Once a robot called the Vital Guarder is introduced, however, the battles go from being intense cat-and-mouse chases to sub-par action scenes involving the Vital Guarder battling enemy robots which have increasingly ridiculous and cartoonish enemy crews behind them (the crew of old women, in particular, makes me wince just thinking about it).There is one exceedingly bizarre episode with a tone that entirely contradicts the seriousness of the rest of the series. This is not to say that humor is bad for the show. I mentioned that the show can be funny, and it manages to weave in some humor into most of the episodes to keep things from getting too grim, but this episode was just... strange.Some of the dialogue later in the series suffers from what I call Akira-Syndrome. This is because in the anime film Akira roughly half of the dialogue in the movie was simply Tetsuo and Kaneda screeching oneanother's names.""TETSUOOOOOOOOO!!!""""KANNNNEEEEDDDDAAAA!!!""""TETSUOOOOOOOOO!!!""""KANNNNEEEEDDDDAAAA!!!""Thankfully, it is nowhere near as bad here in Infinite Ryvius as it is in Akira, but characters still do screech the names of other characters at least once an episode in the second half of the series. This much-maligned device is unrealistic, melodramatic, and undermines the intensity of the show's otherwise powerful drama.In general, more subtle ways of expressing shock or horror are generally more effective.The ending of the series sucks. Plain to say: it stinks. I know great anime with bad or unsatisfactory endings aren't exactly rare (Evangelion, Mahoromatic, Rurouni Kenshin, Berserk, etc.), but it never manages to disappoint when it cuts off a great show at the bud. There were still several things this series needed to do: it needed to deliver a proper dramatic climax (the build-up had been steady for the whole series, and then episode 25 concludes everything dramatically in one fell swoop), it was building up to a great analysis of a character named Ikumi (he abruptly complains about his past near the end of the series, but it was totally artificial, made no sense in terms of the context of the situation, and it would probably have been better if they'd just tried to leave his backstory unfinished), lost a great opportunity to psychoanalyze Faina, who was probably the most interesting character in the entire series, and compromised the narrative integrity of the rest of the series by including an asinine epilogue as the last in the series.It sounds like I am complaining about this show a lot, but there is a reason I'm giving it four stars. For all its flaws, this is still great stuff, and, like Evangelion, will likely linger in the recesses of one's memory long after one has watched it despite its flaws. There is anime out there that is more well-animated, or that has better music, or that isn't nearly so flawed in execution, but most of it is gloss that becomes the flavor of the month and then vanishes into history. I only complain about what it does wrong because of how much it does right, and it does not deserve to die prematurely. Hopefully this will one day enjoy a revival.",4,How did I miss this show for so long?,1257984000,"11 12, 2009",2009,8285,"['recently', 'watched', 'full', 'length', 'anime', 'series', 'Infinite',

904137,A3FIKATQ286DMV,B0009E32VG,Niko,"[5, 7]","Well, to begin with, a previous reviewer has given a very detailed outline of the story which basically means that as the story concerns there is not much left for me to write.So you may ask yourselves, what kind of review is this than?Basically, I will point out a few things about these series that may help the reader to grasp a complete picture of the shows (as far as it possible of course without given spoilers away).This series are concentrating on character development and on how people would react if hope would be taken away from them. We see for instance how the main character from an uncertain individual grows up in becoming a very capable man and in the end he will proof it as well.In other words, this series strongest point is character development which I have very rarely seen in any other animes.As the story concerns in the beginning it is starting a little slow but when it starts it seriously kicks off. Additionally, if you are not so much into emotional things than this series are not for you because they will definitely put you into an emotional rollercoaster. Also, it is a combination of romance, drama, action and science fiction.Furthermore, the complexity of these shows may relay in the fact that various characters will be introduced (and I mean many) and all of their characters will be very well developed and are presented in a very balanced way. With the term balance I mean that many shows fail in the fact to introduce characters as they should be and are giving an annoying impression to the viewer, something that is not the case with Infinite Ryvius.Last but not least, as another reviewer has stated it (who was completely right): `It is as if you hit on a gold mine with these series'.I personally am highly recommending these shows to someone who would also, besides action etc., want to see a very strong plot and strong story going on with many twists in it.",5,A gold mine that is overlooked!!!,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,1910,"['Well', 'begin', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'given', 'very', 'detailed', 'outline', 'story', 'basically', 'story', 'concerns', 'not', 'much', 'left', 'write.So', 'may', 'ask', 'yourselves', 'what', 'kind', 'review', 'Basically', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'few', 'things', 'series', 'may', 'help', 'reader', 'grasp', 'complete', 'picture', 'shows', 'as', 'far', 'possible', 'course', 'given', 'spoilers', 'away', '.This', 'series', 'are', 'concentrating', 'character', 'development', 'how', 'people', 'would', 'react', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'see', 'instance', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'uncertain', 'individual', 'up', 'becoming', 'very', 'capable', 'man', 'end', 'will', 'proof', 'well.In', 'other', 'words', 'series', 'strongest', 'point', 'character', 'development', 'have', 'very', 'rarely', 'seen', 'other', 'animes.As', 'story', 'concerns', 'beginning', 'starting', 'little', 'slow', 'when', 'seriously', 'off', 'Additionally', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'emotional', 'things', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'will', 'definitely', 'put', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'Also', 'combination', 'romance', 'drama', 'action', 'science', 'fiction.Furthermore', 'complexity', 'shows', 'may', 'relay', 'fact', 'various', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'introduced', 'mean', 'many', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'are', 'presented', 'very', 'balanced', 'way', 'term', 'balance', 'mean', 'many', 'shows', 'fail', 'fact', 'introduce', 'characters', 'should', 'be', 'are', 'giving', 'annoying', 'impression', 'viewer', 'something', 'not', 'case', 'Infinite', 'Ryvius.Last', 'not', 'least', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'who', 'was', 'completely', 'right', 'hit', 'gold', 'mine', ""series'.I"", 'personally', 'am', 'highly', 'recommending', 'shows', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'also', 'action', 'etc.', 'want', 'see', 'very', 'strong', 'plot', 'strong', 'story', 'going', 'many', 'twists']",Infinite Ryvius
