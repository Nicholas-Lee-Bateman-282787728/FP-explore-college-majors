My plans were to watch the new season when it officially started, but it slipped my mind and season three started without me. Yes, I could have went online and read each episode synopsis, as the season had already aired in the UK on BBC, but this is one series I enjoy watching, so I patiently waited until it came out on DVD. Season three has many things going on, including a few new characters. Once again, Heidi Thomas does a wonderful job with writing memorizing scripts. All of cast gives great performances, as well. There may be only eight episodes (well nine if you count the Christmas Special), but a lot happens in them. Considering the series is returning for another Christmas Special and a fourth season next year, I was a little shocked at the ending of the episode eight. I don't won't to give away the ending, but I will say that one character's journey comes full circle. I am curious what Heidi Thomas has in store for the Nonnatus House next season.
