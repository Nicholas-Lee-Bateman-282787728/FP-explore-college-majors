Not surprisingly Full Moon Pictures didnt produce this one. Which is obivously why it sucks and is not a legit entry to either series.  Most of the puppets/toys dont look anything close to the originals. I cant believe Corey Feldman was in something like this, hes better than that.

946069,A2SRP2HP75CUVD,B000BO0KOQ,Horror-Fanatics.com,"[4, 6]","Back when Fullmoon owned the rights to both movie franchises, it was originally planned that they would make a Puppet Wars mini-series back in the 1990's. Sadly the series idea was scrapped due to insufficient funds. Now that the Sci-fi Channel holds the right, they aired the ""long awaited cinematic showdown"" known as 'Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys'. Full Moon had nothing to do with the project. This is the third film in the Demonic Toys series and the 9th film in the Puppet Master series. The story takes place near Christmas eve, in which the Robert Toulon (great nephew of Andre Toulon) uses the reanimating fluid to revive the puppets we all know and love. What Toulon didn't know whas that he was being closely watched by a huge toy company. The head mistress of this highly popular toy company Erica Sharpe makes a deal with a demon from hell. The demon is hell bent on revenge and demands Toulon's blood. So Erica gets help from some well known Demonic Toys and plots to bring the entire toy line to life to spread innocent blood on christmas morning. So it's up to Robert and his gang of puppets to try and stop the evil madness.Well first I would just like to say that im a big fan of both the Puppet Master and Demonic Toys movies, even though there were very few Demonic Toys movies. The last Demonic Toys movie just so happened to be 'Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys', which was just a big letdown. This movie is actually a letdown as well. This film was originally planned back in the 90's when Fullmoon brought up the idea of a mini-series. Well after a long wait the movie finally got made. Was it worth the wait? My answer would be yes and no. There were some things that I liked about this movie, but the bad really outweighs the good. I was mostly disappointed with this film and it was hard for me to take it seriously. From the characters, to the acting and even down to the look of the smaller evil characters. The idea of both movie franchises coming together really caught my attention and even had me pumped up to see it. I honestly didn't know what to expect and I'm really glad that I wasn't expecting it to be great or anything fantastic. What I found most entertaining was the acting from Corey Feldman. I couldn't help but laugh most of the time he talked, which was actually most of the movie. I found myself laughing at the little things that just weren't meant to be funny.When I first found out that this would premiere on the Sci-Fi channel I knew right away that the movie would end up being low budget and corny. To no surprise I was correct. The acting in the film was off and at times the movements from the puppets looked cheap and fast. I happen to love cheesy flicks but seeing this film is just as fun as watching time fly by. Seeing the puppets and demonic toys on screen again was a neat pleasure though, but seeing them fight was a whole different story. For one the way the puppets and toys looked were kind of disappointing. I may sound picky for saying this but each of the puppets and toys used in this film were newly built and looked different. Its hard to describe the looks but its really noticeable, especially with the demonic toys. They just seemed to look less scary and evil (especially the toy bear, he looked more cute than threatening). The other thing that bothered me is the fact that they used only a few of the well known dolls in the movie. We get to see the puppets Blade, Pinhead, Chester and 6 Shooter. As for the evil toys we get to see Oopsidasy (baby doll), the teddy bear and that crazy Jack in the box. It was nice seeing them in a film together but I thought all the so called fight scenes were horrible and embarrassing. It makes sense knowing that this is a low budget feature, so it's not like you're going to see grade A fight sequences with the best special effects anyway.I think it was a smart move to have this film premiere on the Sc-Fi channel. They really didn't have to cut out much because there is hardly any gore shown. There is some blood and gore, just not that much. Like a lot of low budget films this one definitely has its corny moments. Some of them were positives to me, I had a good laugh watching this movie and I did find some things entertaining. Sadly I found there to be more negatives than positives. The story could have been a lot better, but the way everything was put together was pretty decent. The demonic toy Oopsidasy is a hilarious character as always, using his ass more than once and saying those funny lines. That character was one of the highlights for me. The fight sequences between the puppets and toys were short and lame. You'd figure that they could've done a much better job with that aspect of the picture, especially since that's what the movie is based upon. Part of  reason why I wanted to see this film was to watch all the characters collide in a battle to the death. In the end I was disappointed with the outcome. Hell at least they gave the puppets a cyber upgrade, not to mention the DVD is pretty cheap so you can pick it up for a low price. But even then you really got to think hard about doing that.Overall I thought this was a pretty bad movie. But if you don't take it too seriously then perhaps you will enjoy it more than I did. I honestly just couldn't take it seriously. The story could've been better, the acting is bad and I thought it was unimpressive. Sure it's low budget and im usually into those kind of films, but this one is pretty bad. If you enjoy watching really corny movies then I definitely recommend checking this out. I'm sure you'll have a laugh all the way through. If you're a fan of either the Puppet Master or Demonic Toys movies then you will very disappointed with this film. If you ever do plan on watching it then just rent it and don't expect anything great or fancy. Just grab a group of friends, make some popcorn and laugh your asses off.",3,"Unimpressive, yet funny",1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,5912,"['Back', 'when', 'Fullmoon', 'owned', 'rights', 'movie',

946070,A20L3YKLJA2G95,B000BO0KOQ,Jay,"[4, 4]","As an avid fan of Full Moon productions, and their horrible films, I just had to watch Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys. The first thing I found out was that this film has nothing to do with Full Moon except for it's puppet characters. Charles Band often receives credit as the Executive Producer but had nothing to do with the film. Full Moon originally planned to do the film as part of a mini-series in the 90's, but they had to drop the idea when they didn't have the funds to get the job done. They must have really hit a low point since it couldn't possibly take much money to make any feature they do. Thankfully the Sci-Fi channel stepped in to grab the idea and do the movie under their studio and now we have a mess of a Christmas movie with killer puppets.Taking place in California, the nephew of deceased Toy maker Andre Toulon Robert Toulon (Feldman) is now the owner of the Toulon Doll Hospital. As he continues to find a formula to bring the puppets to life he accidentally comes to find his blood is the missing ingredient to doing just that. Once he gets the serum finished he injects the Puppet Master puppets and back to life they are. The only problem is rivaled company Share Toys, run by the evil Erica Sharpe (Vanessa Angel), have been spying on Robert in hoped of finding this serum for their own Demonic Toys. They want to create these toys in time for the Holidays so Christmas morning each household will be slayed by the evil gifts. Talk about spreading holiday cheer huh? Once Robert finds out their sick plot he gets his puppets together and they have the ultimate b battle royal.I have to say this one will be a new favorite in the holiday collection. Not for it's good acting or well written script but for the hours of laughter it provided. Corey Feldman was simply awful. He is supposed to be an older scientist type but just looks like himself with some cheap gray hair coloring. He also talks raspy somehow thinking that will add the years. It really was just perfect for my expectations.

946074,A18IQME5DCSH2L,B000BO0KOQ,"Madelyn Pryor ""Goblyn Queen""","[7, 10]","For those of us that were fortunate enough to watch the delicious demonic horror of the first Full Moon movies of the late 80s and early 90's, this DVD will remind us how brilliant the first few Puppet Master films were, or how devilish the first Demonic Toys film was. This movie captures all that lightning in a bottle, adds an extra dose of humor, and gift wraps the whole thing just in time for the holidays.Featuring Corey Feldman as one of the decedents of Andre Toulon, who rediscovers 4 of the beloved Toulon puppets -Blade, Pinhead, Jester, and Six-Shooter, he reanimates them and sets about trying to protect them. But, the head of Sharpe toys, Erica Sharpe played by Vanessa Angel, has her own plans for both Toulon and his puppets as she plans to create an army of demonic toys on Christmas Day.The animation of the dolls and puppets isn't as painstaking as it has been in the past, and the special effects are slightly sub-par, but the acting is brilliantly outlandish and the script his hilarious.This was made for TV, so while there is some violence, there is minimal cursing and it's the most wholesome horror movie I have seen for quite some time. Yet, that wholesomeness does nothing to take away from the fun of the film.So if you like full moon, if you like horror movies, if you want an alternative holiday film instead of It's a Wonderful Life, then this is your film, and a smart addition to your library for the money.Highly recommended.",5,The best Puppet Master film in over a decade,1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,1461,"['were', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'watch', 'delicious', 'demonic', 'horror', 'first', 'Full', 'Moon', 'movies', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90', 'DVD', 'will', 'remind', 'how', 'brilliant', 'first', 'few', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'films', 'were', 'how', 'devilish', 'first', 'Demonic', 'Toys', 'film', 'was', 'movie', 'lightning', 'bottle', 'extra', 'dose', 'humor', 'gift', 'wraps', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'time', 'holidays.Featuring', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'one', 'decedents', 'Andre', 'Toulon', 'who', '4', 'beloved', 'Toulon', 'puppets', '-Blade', 'Pinhead', 'Jester', 'Six-Shooter', 'sets', 'trying', 'protect', 'head', 'Sharpe', 'toys', 'Erica', 'Sharpe', 'played', 'Vanessa', 'Angel', 'own', 'plans', 'Toulon', 'puppets', 'create', 'army', 'demonic', 'toys', 'Christmas', 'Day.The', 'animation', 'dolls', 'puppets', ""n't"", 'as', 'painstaking', 'been', 'past', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'slightly', 'sub-par', 'acting', 'brilliantly', 'outlandish', 'script', 'hilarious.This', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'so', 'violence', 'minimal', 'cursing', 'most', 'wholesome', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'wholesomeness', 'nothing', 'take', 'away', 'fun', 'film.So', 'like', 'full', 'moon', 'like', 'horror', 'movies', 'want', 'alternative', 'holiday', 'film', 'instead', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'then', 'film', 'smart', 'addition', 'library', 'money.Highly', 'recommended']",Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys

This is definitely one of the poorer thought out and executed ""vs"" movies to have been created. First off, if ""New Moon"" where not the ones making a Puppet Master film, then you knew it was doomed to fail. New Moon haven't always hit the mark in all the movies they have done of the PM series, but you just know someone else could have done it worse.The movie begins with Corey Feldman, a father character and his daughter. The voice Corey used for his character I thought was a joke that was going to pass, but no, he stuck it out for the whole film. A stupid voice that sounded completely fake and irritating. It seemed like another one of these movies Corey did just for the money, and didn't bother to do a decent job in earning it. If I was directing him on the first day, i'd slap him on the side of the head, tell him to stop being an idiot and do the job properly, or else find someone better with more talent for half the price.The plot is that whoever Dorky Feldmen is playing is the decedent of the Puppet Master and has done what no one else in the PM franchise has ever been able to do before, and recreate the serum to bring the puppets to life. Only for some reason the serum is blue now, not green... why? Because no one bothered to watch any of the previous PM movies most likely.So while he and his daughter and bringing life back to the dolls, he is being spied on by the chick from Weird Science who has made a pact with the devil to ship out a bunch of demonic toys that will come to life and slaughter children on Xmas day... but she also finds out about Toulons puppets, and wants them for herself, so when she gets involved trying to steal them, Toulon (Feldmen) decides he must save the toy and put an end to her evil plans with her help from the Demonic Toys.Overall; a pretty pathetic movie...  the Demonic Baby has a few laughs with some fart humor, but overall, if they had cast someone better then Corey Feldman to take the role more seriously, and notched up the terrible acting on most others parts, it might have been passable as a decent B-grade TV movie.",2,Corey Feldmen killed it,1278979200,"07 13, 2010",2010,2293,"['When', 'take', 'two', 'decently', 'well', 'known', 'horror', 'icons', 'genre', 'decide', 'pit', 'other', 'sound', 'cool', 'concept', 'once', 'production', 'real', 'nightmare', 'definitely', 'one', 'poorer', 'thought', 'out', 'executed', 'vs', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'First', 'off', 'New', 'Moon', 'where', 'not', 'ones', 'making', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'film', 'then', 'knew', 'was', 'doomed', 'fail', 'New', 'Moon', 'have', ""n't"", 'always', 'hit', 'mark', 'movies', 'have', 'done', 'PM', 'series', 'just', 'know', 'someone', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'worse.The', 'movie', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'father', 'character', 'daughter', 'voice', 'Corey', 'used', 'character', 'thought', 'was', 'joke', 'was', 'going', 'pass', 'stuck', 'out', 'whole', 'film', 'stupid', 'voice', 'sounded', 'completely', 'fake', 'irritating', 'seemed', 'one', 'movies', 'Corey', 'did', 'just', 'money', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'earning', 'was', 'directing', 'first', 'day', 'i', ""'d"", 'slap', 'side', 'head', 'tell', 'stop', 'being', 'idiot', 'do', 'job', 'properly', 'else', 'find', 'someone', 'better', 'more', 'talent', 'price.The', 'plot', 'whoever', 'Dorky', 'Feldmen', 'playing', 'decedent', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'done', 'what', 'one', 'else', 'PM', 'franchise', 'ever', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'recreate', 'serum', 'bring', 'puppets', 'life', 'Only', 'reason', 'serum', 'blue', 'now', 'not', 'green', 'why', 'one', 'bothered', 'watch', 'previous', 'PM', 'movies', 'most', 'likely.So', 'daughter', 'bringing', 'life', 'back', 'dolls', 'being', 'spied', 'chick', 'Weird', 'Science', 'who', 'made', 'pact', 'devil', 'ship', 'out', 'bunch', 'demonic', 'toys', 'will', 'come', 'life', 'slaughter', 'children', 'Xmas', 'day', 'also', 'out', 'Toulons', 'puppets', 'herself', 'so', 'when', 'involved', 'trying', 'steal', 'Toulon', 'Feldmen', 'must', 'save', 'toy', 'put', 'end', 'evil', 'plans', 'help', 'Demonic', 'Toys.Overall', 'pretty', 'pathetic', 'movie', 'Demonic', 'Baby', 'few', 'laughs', 'fart', 'humor', 'overall', 'had', 'cast', 'someone', 'better', 'then', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'take', 'role', 'more', 'seriously', 'notched', 'up', 'terrible', 'acting', 'most', 'others', 'parts', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'passable', 'decent', 'B-grade', 'TV', 'movie']",Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys

The plot is worse than even the worst of the Puppet Master original series titles, the acting makes the Full Moon actors look like Oscar Winners and the puppets aren't even close to the real deal!I guess the easiest question I have is, Why even buy the rights to a franchise if you're not going to use the signatures of the franchise in the first film you make with it? Blade, Six Shooter, Jester, Pinhead are replicated in this movie so poorly it looks as if an 8 year old art student made them. Pinhead's hands even appear to be clay.Worse is the movements. They don't have any of the fluent movements that were trademark to how the puppets looked real and there are scenes where there are massive amounts of strings showing everywhere. It's embarrassing to say the least.The puppets weren't talkers before but they made sounds. This time they were completely mute. I wish I could have said the same for Corey Feldman who used to know how to act but in this movie comes off so over the top it's impossible to care about him or feel any sense of empathy for his character oncesoever. Most of the time you're wishing you had a gun to shoot yourself with so you could end his speaking parts.The Demonic Toys look different and if possible even more cheap than before also. Full Moon might not have had the greatest actors, scripts or special effects but they usually spent a sufficient amount of time, money and energy on making the dolls (the stars of their movies) look good.There is another small glitch in this movie that will annoy the fans of the Puppet Master franchise. Somehow Toulon's blood is needed for the formula to keep the dolls alive. The formula is now injected into holes in the back of the puppet's necks. For casual fans this is not a big deal, for longtime fans they know Toulon's blood had nothing to do with the formula and in part Three Toulon clearly injects them in the front of the neck area in a way that made it clear that as long as they got an injection, the puppets were fine.Vanessa Angel is not a bad actress and has a million dollar body but she's stuck in a role and a movie that screams ""I just want to collect a paycheck"".The Puppet Master theme music is blatantly absent as is the entire feel of the Full Moon series. The actors are horrible and seem to have to pause through lines in order to spit out the script they were supposed to remember and although the Demonic Toys franchise is much smaller I'm sure their fans felt disrespected by how marginalized their toys were to Angel's character, Sharpe.Full Moon had this project announced before they folded. If only they had completed this then and not let Sci Fi skimp and cheat their way into trashing two beloved cult franchises with one movie that is so blatantly bad that it even loses the appeal of goofy and cheesy that so many second and third rate horror films fall into.Avoid at all costs if you like either series.",1,Horribly disrespectful to two franchises.,1159833600,"10 3, 2006",2006,3039,"['Look', 'know', 'Full', 'Moon', 'went', 'who', 'knew', 'next', 'time', ""'d"", 'see', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'would', 'be', 'awful', 'plot', 'worse', 'even', 'worst', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'original', 'series', 'titles', 'acting', 'Full', 'Moon', 'actors', 'look', 'Oscar', 'Winners', 'puppets', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'real', 'deal', 'guess', 'easiest', 'question', 'have', 'Why', 'even', 'buy', 'rights', 'franchise', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'use', 'signatures', 'franchise', 'first', 'film', 'make', 'Blade', 'Six', 'Shooter', 'Jester', 'Pinhead', 'are', 'replicated', 'movie', 'so', 'poorly', '8', 'year', 'old', 'art', 'student', 'made', 'Pinhead', 'hands', 'even', 'appear', 'be', 'clay.Worse', 'movements', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'fluent', 'movements', 'were', 'trademark', 'how', 'puppets', 'looked', 'real', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'are', 'massive', 'amounts', 'strings', 'showing', 'everywhere', 'embarrassing', 'say', 'least.The', 'puppets', 'were', ""n't"", 'talkers', 'made', 'sounds', 'time', 'were', 'completely', 'mute', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'said', 'same', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'who', 'used', 'know', 'how', 'act', 'movie', 'off', 'so', 'top', 'impossible', 'care', 'feel', 'sense', 'empathy', 'character', 'oncesoever', 'Most', 'time', ""'re"", 'wishing', 'had', 'gun', 'shoot', 'could', 'end', 'speaking', 'parts.The', 'Demonic', 'Toys', 'look', 'different', 'possible', 'even', 'more', 'cheap', 'before', 'also', 'Full', 'Moon', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'greatest', 'actors', 'scripts', 'special', 'effects', 'usually', 'spent', 'sufficient', 'amount', 'time', 'money', 'energy', 'making', 'dolls', 'stars', 'movies', 'look', 'small', 'glitch', 'movie', 'will', 'annoy', 'fans', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'franchise', 'Somehow', 'Toulon', 'blood', 'needed', 'formula', 'keep', 'dolls', 'alive', 'formula', 'now', 'injected', 'holes', 'back', 'puppet', 'necks', 'casual', 'fans', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'longtime', 'fans', 'know', 'Toulon', 'blood', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'formula', 'part', 'Three', 'Toulon', 'clearly', 'front', 'neck', 'area', 'way', 'made', 'clear', 'as', 'long', 'got', 'injection', 'puppets', 'were', 'fine.Vanessa', 'Angel', 'not', 'bad', 'actress', 'million', 'dollar', 'body', 'stuck', 'role', 'movie', 'just', 'want', 'collect', 'paycheck', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'theme', 'music', 'blatantly', 'absent', 'entire', 'feel', 'Full', 'Moon', 'series', 'actors', 'are', 'horrible', 'seem', 'have', 'pause', 'lines', 'order', 'spit', 'out', 'script', 'were', 'supposed', 'remember', 'Demonic', 'Toys', 'franchise', 'much', 'smaller', ""'m"", 'sure', 'fans', 'felt', 'disrespected', 'how', 'marginalized', 'toys', 'were', 'Angel', 'character', 'Sharpe.Full', 'Moon', 'had', 'project', 'announced', 'folded', 'only', 'had', 'completed', 'then', 'not', 'let', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'skimp', 'cheat', 'way', 'trashing', 'two', 'beloved', 'cult', 'franchises', 'one', 'movie', 'so', 'blatantly', 'bad', 'even', 'appeal', 'goofy', 'cheesy', 'so', 'many', 'second', 'third', 'rate', 'horror', 'films', 'fall', 'into.Avoid', 'costs', 'like', 'series']",Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys

946083,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B000BO0KOQ,Sid the Elf,"[4, 5]","In 1989 the world was introduced to a company soley commited to the b horror community best known as Full Moon productions. The creator of this low budget empire is Charles Band who created Full Moon as a second attempt after he failed miserably with another production company. His first release was Puppet Master which came out on VHS and laserdisc (yeah laser disc, awesome) and turned out to be a huge success. This would get the ball rolling turning out a huge cult following causing Puppet Master to turn into a series of films. As the years rolled on Charles Band was asked to make some slasher flicks to try to compete with the ""Scream"" era and did so under a new production company known as Shadow Films which only lasted two years after the films failed. Charles then decided to rebirth Full Moon and which brings us to tonight's feature Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys. This film is a beautiful combo of the puppets from Puppet Master and the toys from Demonic Toys in an all out feats of strength. Is it possible for anything to be more B then this? Now looking at the four star rating may make you wonder why would we give a rating so high. See the thing with Full Moon productions is if you are willing to watch one then you know what to expect. You look for terrible acting, horrible special effects, and a little comedy mixed in. If they produced an actual great film we'd probably give it 1 star due to extreme confusion.We start off 2 days before Christmas (Oh Boy! Sid's favorite) with Toy maker Robert Toulon (Corey Feldman) as he and his daughter work on the puppet master puppets. Toulon is the family that gave birth to these puppets and now their lives belong to Robert who cares for them. The only issue is they aren't alive anymore which forces Robert to go nuts trying to find a serum that will revive them. Batch after batch won't work until he accidentally cuts himself and blood drips into the mix. Once he does that it starts bubbling up and changing colors. He injects the mix into the puppets and within a few minutes they are back to life. The puppets are actually good and live to protect Feldman's family. Who would've thought the uber B Feldman was a genius scientist in charge of ressurecting puppet b? Now that the puppets are alive you see Robert's house has a hidden camera which a rival Toy company has planted to see if he would ever bring the puppets back. The evil owner of the rival company is Erica Sharpe (Vanessa Angel) who is bent on controlling the puppets. Now to add the even more b element is Vanessa Angel who you may remember from Wierd Science. No, not the movie but the early 90's tv series. There a well earned star right there. In order for her to control the puppets she must call upon her own pint sized creatures the Demonic Toys. These consist of a jack in the box clown, and teddy bear, and a baby doll with a truck drivers mouth. The baby is hilarious! He talks very much like a gruff well known midget actor who will remain nameless (another star earned) as he yells out things like ""shut up b***h."" In order to get the toys to do their evil deeds they make a pact with the devil who wants Robert's daughter sacrificed by sun up or else Vanessa will be banished to the underworld.Now that the pact has been made Vanessa sends out a crew to kidnap the daughter and the puppets to bring to her headquarters. Once they abduct them Robert is notified that he must be escorted to the sacrifice if he wishes to see his daughter again. Once there he tells the puppets to awake and they bust out of their crate ready to kill. We now have an extremely b puppet/toy fight where they pulled out all the special effects Full Moon had to offer, which must have amounted to $7.50 tops. In the end we have the puppets as the victorious ones saving the world from the wrath of 3 killer toys.As far as Full Moon goes this one's got it. It's there typical campy horror movie but so much fun to watch. It just screams a slot on tv around 2 in the morning. If you are thinking of checking this one out then you must know what to expect. The acting is bad especially from Corey Feldman who is pretending to be like a 50 year old guy, but changes nothing except putting a little grey color in his hair and talking with a scratchier voice.

An who the hell thought that having Corey Feldman as a mad scientist is a good ideal.Having Cory doing anything is a bad ideal. Any ways Corey attempts to recreate the formula and bring the puppets back to life,all the while the head of a toy corporation has made a pact with the devil in hopes of bringing forth chaos and destruction on Christmas Eve the help of the formula. Naturally she attempts to steal the formula. Basically towards the end we get to finally see the lame match up between the toys. For some reason they decided to change the look of the original Demonic Toys but keep the same look of the Puppet Masters ones. Eithier way, the new look is horrible. Despite what attempt at horror they try to deliver, they come off simply as an annoyance.Probably the most intresting aspect of this dribble would be the upgrade they made to the Puppet master toys receive towards the end. What could have been a fun cheesy ride of a film turned out to be a long segment of some lost Are You Afraid of the Dark episode on Nickelodian. This is just made for TV trash. horrible cast,acting,directing and script, do not even bother a second on this crap.",1,Crap VS.
