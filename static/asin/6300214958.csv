At this time, Murphy was doing a very advanced sort of high-school class clown comedy, with all the crudity one would expect from the genre. While Richard Pryor dealt with raw reality, Murphy amused with impressions and raw storytelling mixed with the profanity. Don't expect Pryor's depth here.Much of this was shocking, but not considered that offensive at the time. The general response was ""I can't beleive he's saying this!"" But political correctness was still in the future, so the gags with the f-word for gays and of AIDS would be more controversial now than then.But most of this is undeniably funny. The Elvis impression (We're gonna win this race), the gay Mr. T, (Hey boy, you lookin' kind of good in them jeans. MMMmmmmm!) James Brown (What the (bleep) Brother James be sayin?-presaging his turn as James Thunder Early in DREAMGIRLS), and the Honeymooners (Norton, I know and YOU know....), The ice cream man (You on the wel-fare, you can't af-ford it!) is all pretty knee-slapping, leave your brains at the door fun.

Thats how funny I thought this was/is.  I saw every punchline coming and I laughed outloud at every one of them like it was the first time I was hearing it.  I was 13yo when this was shown on HBO and I remember people talking about it and imitating parts of it and it still goes on TODAY... I mean, look at the title of the reviews on here. lol.  The brand new 34 minute interview didn't go in depth as I thought it would or should but it was still nice to hear Eddie's thoughts on something he did nearly 24 years ago when he was barely out of his teens(and his red leather outfit didn't match? Nobody would've known that if Eddie didn't say it in the interview).  I often wondered why it took so long for it to come out on DVD.  I wonder if it was because of the politically incorrect tirades on gays and the new(at the time) AIDS epidemic saying things like 'girls kiss a gay guy and go home with aids on their lips', etc... Did Murphy not want it released? Who knows what the reason is because it's out now and we can all laugh at something we watched when we were all(most likely) teenagers watching a new channel called HBO and laughing at how foul mouthed and funny Eddie was.  Delirous is way ahead of Raw, his 1987 standup, because Raw seemed to be a bit angry.  It's still funny but the two videos are so different in tone that, at least for me, I tend to gravitate towards the more fun of the two.

The film is side splitting from the outset; Eddie just seems to bring that uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing funny. Revisiting ""Delirious"" 24 years after its creation is great to have. The material does seem to have aged as well as the transformation to this disc, but it's hilarious.The look of Eddie and some of the pop culture it consists of gives it away that this is the '80s; however, enough of the material is comprised of solid universal themes it remains funny. I still laugh myself senselessly when Murphy launches into ""I got some ice cream, I got some ice cream!"" or ""I want half!"" He's a filthy mouthed funny guy that reminds me of Richard Pryor's vulgarity coupled with Bill Cosby's charm. He is a brilliant comedian with a tremendous standup presence. It's a shame Murphy has given up live performance, because ""Delirious"" proves he was a master of the comedy stage.The shocking thing watching the special is how offensive Murphy was back in the day, and how he offers no apology for the material. He was more hyper than he is now, more irreverent, and also a lot cockier. He does come off as a homophobe with his insensitive remarks, but you have to keep the era in context.

And Eddie Murphy's comedy routine in Delirious is as vulgar as anything ever put to record or videotape.  Yet Murphy is at the same time as funny as any comedian ever heard to that point.Murphy circa-1983 is proudly offensive, skewering his subjects with hilarious venom.  Today people will cringe at his blatant homophobia, ignoring that his comedy nails down the patent absurdity involved in homosexuality.  Murphy also nails other subjects, one of which is strikingly relevent circa 2003 - Murphy skewers pop singer Michael Jackson and elements of his female fandom, and seen today it graphically reminds the viewer just what Michael Jackson truly is.  The amazing part is Murphy's lampoon is done with a completely straight face, even as the packed house overwhelms the sound system as the audience dies laughing and screaming as Murphy skewer's Jackson's song &quot;She's Out Of My Life&quot;; that Murphy can maintain his comedic composure through all this is a sign of a true pro.He gets what amounts to a standing ovation repeatedly throughout the performance, notably during the Michael Jackson lampoon and also when he imitates Elvis Presley, capturing Presley's posture before his death; the sight of Murphy walking as circa-1970s Elvis is worth the price of admission by itself.Then there is the epic of the mother who uses a shoe to strike her unruly children, told as played by Clint Eastwood - &quot;Why'd you eat the ice cream off the floor?&quot; after Murphy whistles the &quot;Fistful of Dollars&quot; theme once again brings the house down, and it happens again in the funniest part of the subject - the mother and father preparing to go out one night, but the mother hears (via Murphy's dead-on imitation of the Six Million Dollar Man scanning sound effect) her unruly children and their friends on bunkbeds and a high heel shoe becomes the perfect boomerang.Offensive, yes, and proudly so, and in these times of intellectual ossification known as political correctness such offensiveness can actually be a necessity.",4,Proudly Offensive - And Funny,1069977600,"11 28, 2003",2003,2190,"['Normally', 'dislike', 'comedy', 'oriented', 'vulgarity', 'vulgarity', 'only', 'purpose', 'comedy', 'shock', 'value', 'while', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'comedy', 'routine', 'Delirious', 'as', 'vulgar', 'anything', 'ever', 'put', 'record', 'videotape', 'Murphy', 'same', 'time', 'as', 'funny', 'comedian', 'ever', 'heard', 'point.Murphy', 'circa-1983', 'proudly', 'offensive', 'skewering', 'subjects', 'hilarious', 'venom', 'Today', 'people', 'will', 'cringe', 'blatant', 'homophobia', 'ignoring', 'comedy', 'nails', 'down', 'patent', 'absurdity', 'involved', 'homosexuality', 'Murphy', 'also', 'other', 'subjects', 'one', 'strikingly', 'relevent', 'circa', '2003', 'Murphy', 'skewers', 'pop', 'singer', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'elements', 'female', 'fandom', 'seen', 'today', 'graphically', 'viewer', 'just', 'what', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'truly', 'amazing', 'part', 'Murphy', 'lampoon', 'done', 'completely', 'straight', 'face', 'even', 'packed', 'house', 'overwhelms', 'sound', 'system', 'audience', 'laughing', 'screaming', 'Murphy', 'skewer', 'Jackson', 'song', 'quot', 'My', 'Life', 'quot', 'Murphy', 'can', 'maintain', 'comedic', 'composure', 'sign', 'true', 'pro.He', 'what', 'standing', 'ovation', 'repeatedly', 'performance', 'notably', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'lampoon', 'also', 'when', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'capturing', 'Presley', 'posture', 'death', 'sight', 'Murphy', 'walking', 'circa-1970s', 'Elvis', 'price', 'admission', 'itself.Then', 'epic', 'mother', 'who', 'shoe', 'strike', 'unruly', 'children', 'told', 'played', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'quot', 'Why', ""'d"", 'eat', 'ice', 'cream', 'floor', 'quot', 'Murphy', 'quot', 'Fistful', 'Dollars', 'quot', 'theme', 'once', 'again', 'house', 'down', 'again', 'funniest', 'part', 'subject', 'mother', 'father', 'preparing', 'go', 'out', 'one', 'night', 'mother', 'hears', 'Murphy', 'dead-on', 'imitation', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'scanning', 'sound', 'effect', 'unruly', 'children', 'friends', 'bunkbeds', 'high', 'heel', 'shoe', 'perfect', 'boomerang.Offensive', 'yes', 'proudly', 'so', 'times', 'intellectual', 'ossification', 'known', 'political', 'correctness', 'such', 'offensiveness', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'necessity']",Delirious VHS

I used 'ta see it on HBO all the time in the '80s, but I ain't actually sit down an' watch it thoroughly 'til 'bout 1989 when I was nine years old, an' ever since is' been essential to me, an' one'a the only stand-up shows that never ceases to make me laugh, no matter how many damn times I watch it. Be warned that it is not for the faint of ear an' some portion of it is bound to offend jus' 'bout ANYBODY out there. This brought the raw an' groundbreaking comedy of Redd Foxx an' Pryor to a whole 'nother plateau of obscenity an' political incorrectness, an' made Eddie Murphy prob'ly the most controversial name in comedy at the time. His dead-on impressions an' musings on what it would be like if the Honeymooners were gay, Michael Jackson's femininity, Elvis' drugged-out an' bloated later years, an' James Brown's incomprehensible speech are jus' CLASSIC stuff. Then there's his thoughts on the ""trappings"" of his newfound celebrity (""Women be throwin' it to me on the street like frisbees. HERE! *whoooosh* Thank you! 'Preciate that!""), the rise of black politicians, an' his hilarious tale 'bout his trip to Texas in search of racism which cracks me up every time I jus' THINK 'bout it (if y'all ever see me in a long line at the airport by myself waitin' to get my bags checked an' I jus' bust out laughing, 'ya know what I'm thinkin' 'bout). Of course I couldn't leave without mentionin' his father's drunken tirade against Uncle Gus an' Bigfoot Aunt Bunny at the family cook-out. Thas' some priceless material.This is Eddie's BEST stand-up by all means, an' well eclipses 'Raw', which even I'll admit he went a lil' over-the-top on.  Everytime I think 'bout the people who criticize Eddie's stand-up for bein' too abrasive an' immoral, it jus' makes me sad that people can't jus' have a sense'a humor 'bout any an' e'ything. 'Ay, ya'know what? Maybe it was Y'ALL who drove Eddie to do the lame family comedies he's doin' nowadays! Well, least thas' what I wanna believe.But, look, fa'real now. E'ybody lighten up. As crass an' incredibly offensive as 'Delirious' is, if you'll jus' leave all your beliefs an' convictions at the door, you'll find how surprisingly easy to listen to an' enjoyable it is, because Eddie is one'a the loosest, most comfortable an' charismatic comedic performers EVER. He was BORN to be a star. I can't believe this man was 22 years old when this was filmed, the same age I am right now, an' yet was already an established comedian an' well on his way to bein' a Hollywood superstar. Meanwhile I'M goin' to pick up my unemployment check tomorrow. Man, thas' depressin'.

216031,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,6300214958,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[1, 5]","I rented Eddie Murphy's DVD of ""Raw"" just last year.  I was thinking:  ""Maybe they released this one first because everyone thinks it's better.""  But, I feel: ""No way!  ""Delirious"" is a hundred times funnier!""  On ""Raw"", Eddie sounded a little more mean-spirited, especially about women. On his performance on ""Raw"", just seemed like he had some indirect points to make regarding his own problems involving a particular woman recently in his life. You can see and hear some sincere bitterness in that performance.  And it seems like he was trying to talk to the guys of the audince and convince them to see things his way about women.  Even though I'm a guy, I was uncomfortable watching and listening to Eddie on that performance.However, ""Delirious"" is the performance that made him a star. The humor on ""Delirious"" was far more variable too. He did more celebrity impressions and even created exaggerated performances of his own family. He took the subjects of humor that Bill Cosby probably would do, but Eddie Murphy made it far more nastier.Even Bill Cosby's 1982 performance on DVD called ""Bill Cosby Himself"", is a great DVD to have also for a night of comedy to share when your friends are over.  And Cosby's performance is generally quite clean. And, to me, if you can be hilarious as hell, and get people rolling on the floor laughing, without having to be vulgar in any way, this is what makes a comedian great. However, Eddie is just the opposite of Bill Cosby. But, Eddie does have a lot more talent than the average black comedian.  His timing is in check, his effective use of dramatic pause, and his gift of accurate celebrity impersonations is what made this whole show so great.  He was just as good, if not better than Rich Little.  I've always thought that people who have to use fowl language to express themselves is usually a sign of someone trying, very loudly, to cover up their ignorance. Black and white people both do this when they want to make a point. But, I guess it's routine for black comedians to depend on it more than white comedians.  Eddie sure cleaned up his act over the years though, hasn't he?  Just like Cheech Marin (of Cheech and Chong), they were once vulgar comedians, and now they both do voices for Disney cartoons.I sure hope they don't alter this DVD for the sake of ""political correctness"".  Back in the day, I remember when this show was first released on an album called ""Eddie Murphy: Comedian"".  I wanted to buy it so bad.  Today's kids have no idea what it`s like to struggle to put some money together just to buy an album that you wanted so badly. Back then, we respected our vinyl LP's like they were as cherishable as a piece of fine jewelry. We worked so hard just to buy one new album! I never thought that my parents owed me anything, so if I wanted to buy a record, I had to go out and make my own money.  It's just that simple, and it makes good sense.  I went out and cut people's grass, raked leaves, shoveled snow, washed cars, and did whatever it took just to get a few bucks together to buy that one new album that I just had to have.  I appreciated it more because I know I worked it.  Today's kids have no idea how spoiled they are, and yet they still complain that they don't have enough. They think thier parents owe then something for being alive.  And they measure themselves (and their ""bling"" stock) against their other friends who may possibly have more than them and they try to make us parents feel guilty about it.  Of course, they never tell us about the kid's they know who have so much less than them.I hope they can give their own kids ""half"" of what we gave them growing up. They are going to be in for a shock!!  I know I drifted off the point here about this review, but I just remember fondly of how I applied myself to the working world as a kid to have the nicer things that my friends didn't have because they were too lazy to go out and work for anything.  Buying the album of this Eddie Murphy show is an example of what I went through just because I wanted it.  I just wanted to share that with you.",5,"The best ""stand-up"" comedy routine ever filmed!!",1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,4098,"['rented', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'DVD', 'Raw', 'just', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'thinking', 'Maybe', 'released', 'one', 'first', 'everyone', 'better', 'feel', 'way', 'Delirious', 'hundred', 'times', 'funnier', 'Raw', 'Eddie', 'sounded', 'little', 'more', 'mean-spirited', 'especially', 'women', 'performance', 'Raw', 'just', 'seemed', 'had', 'indirect', 'points', 'make', 'regarding', 'own', 'problems', 'involving', 'particular', 'woman', 'recently', 'life', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'sincere', 'bitterness', 'performance', 'was', 'trying', 'talk', 'guys', 'audince', 'convince', 'see', 'things', 'way', 'women', 'Even', ""'m"", 'guy', 'was', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'listening', 'Eddie', 'performance.However', 'Delirious', 'performance', 'made', 'star', 'humor', 'Delirious', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'variable', 'too', 'did', 'more', 'celebrity', 'impressions', 'even', 'created', 'exaggerated', 'performances', 'own', 'family', 'took', 'subjects', 'humor', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'probably', 'would', 'do', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'nastier.Even', 'Bill', 'Cosby', '1982', 'performance', 'DVD', 'called', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Himself', 'great', 'DVD', 'have', 'also', 'night', 'comedy', 'share', 'when', 'friends', 'are', 'Cosby', 'performance', 'generally', 'quite', 'clean', 'can', 'be', 'hilarious', 'hell', 'get', 'people', 'rolling', 'floor', 'laughing', 'having', 'be', 'vulgar', 'way', 'comedian', 'great', 'However', 'Eddie', 'just', 'opposite', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Eddie', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'talent', 'average', 'black', 'comedian', 'timing', 'check', 'effective', 'use', 'dramatic', 'pause', 'gift', 'accurate', 'celebrity', 'impersonations', 'what', 'made', 'whole', 'show', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'Rich', 'Little', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'use', 'fowl', 'language', 'express', 'usually', 'sign', 'someone', 'trying', 'very', 'loudly', 'cover', 'up', 'ignorance', 'Black', 'white', 'people', 'do', 'when', 'want', 'make', 'point', 'guess', 'routine', 'black', 'comedians', 'depend', 'more', 'white', 'comedians', 'Eddie', 'sure', 'cleaned', 'up', 'act', 'years', ""n't"", 'Just', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'were', 'once', 'vulgar', 'comedians', 'now', 'do', 'voices', 'Disney', 'cartoons.I', 'sure', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'alter', 'DVD', 'sake', 'political', 'correctness', 'Back', 'day', 'remember', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'album', 'called', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Comedian', 'wanted', 'buy', 'so', 'bad', 'Today', 'kids', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 's', 'struggle', 'put', 'money', 'together', 'just', 'buy', 'album', 'wanted', 'so', 'badly', 'Back', 'then', 'respected', 'vinyl', 'LP', 'were', 'as', 'cherishable', 'piece', 'fine', 'jewelry', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'just', 'buy', 'one', 'new', 'album', 'never', 'thought', 'parents', 'owed', 'anything', 'wanted', 'buy', 'record', 'had', 'go', 'out', 'make', 'own', 'money', 'just', 'that', 'simple', 'good', 'sense', 'went', 'out', 'cut', 'people', 'grass', 'raked', 'leaves', 'shoveled', 'snow', 'washed', 'cars', 'did', 'whatever', 'took', 'just', 'get', 'few', 'bucks', 'together', 'buy', 'one', 'new', 'album', 'just', 'had', 'have', 'appreciated', 'more', 'know', 'worked', 'Today', 'kids', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'spoiled', 'are', 'yet', 'still', 'complain', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'think', 'thier', 'parents', 'owe', 'then', 'something', 'being', 'alive', 'measure', 'bling', 'stock', 'other', 'friends', 'who', 'may', 'possibly', 'have', 'more', 'try', 'make', 'parents', 'feel', 'guilty', 'course', 'never', 'tell', 'kid', 'know', 'who', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'them.I', 'hope', 'can', 'give', 'own', 'kids', 'half', 'what', 'gave', 'growing', 'up', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'shock', 'know', 'drifted', 'off', 'point', 'here', 'review', 'just', 'remember', 'fondly', 'how', 'applied', 'working', 'world', 'kid', 'have', 'nicer', 'things', 'friends', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'were', 'too', 'lazy', 'go', 'out', 'work', 'anything', 'Buying', 'album', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'show', 'example', 'what', 'went', 'through', 'just', 'wanted', 'just', 'wanted', 'share']",Delirious VHS

Like most comedy fanatics I love Chappelle, Rock and Mac to name a few but those cats are no Eddie.  As a matter of fact you'll find that much of their material is recycled Murphy-and of course Murphy is a Pryor clone but then again what GOOD black comedian isn't?!  (But that's another subject.)  Okay, so some of you are thinking, ""I already have the VHS.  Why should I buy the DVD?""  I shouldn't have to tell you that the quality is much better but even more, the DVD has an interview of Murphy conducted by Byron Allen.  The interview alone is worth the purchase.

We were staying at someone else's house on vacation, and I saw a tape labeled Eddie Murphy. ""Hmm, what's this?"" I wondered, and popped it in. And I was literally not the same after I watched it. I have never laughed so hard, and the lapse of more than 10 more years does not change that fact. Murphy is sharp, perceptive, goofy, brash, profane...this was the creative pinnacle of his career, box office glories aside. I saw Raw, which was also funny, but it didn't have that same edge for me. The defiling of The Honeymooners, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, James Brown...the hilarious tales from his childhood, especially his Aunt Bunny and his father at family cookouts. This routine is top-notch.To this day, Delirious is the gold standard for me. Every stand-up routine I watch is inevitably compared to this one, although I realize I shouldn't sometimes.

This was the stand up show that got Eddie Murphy in alot of trouble for his jokes on several celebrities, homosexuals, politics, and racial situations, but Eddie was skillful enough to ""tell like it was"" and at the same time embelishing some of the truth for explosive laughs.  A great comedic show is never complete without talking about his childhood and he has it down to a ""T!""  The drunken father, BBQ Family cookouts, shoe throwing mother, and ice cream man bits were priceless!  Some may get offended by the extendeded profanity Eddie uses, but he does'nt force it due to the fact that he had held back long from using the words on NBC's Saturday Night Live (if he wanted to ""keep his job"").  This was my second copy of Delirious and first professional copy period (my first copy was a DVD burned copy that I got from eBay that stopped working after a year) of which I purchased here on Amazon.  Yes, I got the 25th anniversary version with deleted scene and private interview with Eddie about the preparation of the tour.  Fire engine red leather suits and S-curls may not make a comeback, but the magic of Eddie's jokes has never left long time fans and fans of comedy overall.  I urge fans of comedy to get this and 1987's Raw is as equally as hilarious.
