1529895,A1KVO6L7QS6I7G,B007CF6S1Q,xxx,"[11, 12]","I'm a collector of TV shows on DVD and I have a budget that I hold to when purchasing a season; I will not pay more than $1.00 per episode. I have spent years waiting to catch an acceptable price for some shows - the original Avengers for example, and have managed to stay within this set budget, but these split seasons are beginning to cause problems, especially when the split is uneven. Volume one of Royal Pains season three is ten episodes and volume two is only six. Now I might catch volume one on a special at $9.99, maybe around the holidays, but do you really think the price for volume two will ever drop to $6 or less?The show has started to lose its appeal for me anyway; the medical parts of the episodes have begun to be a bit repetitious and in some cases just plain silly. The addition of the ""iconic"" Henry Winkler of Happy Days' fame has actually made me cringe. I have a hard time seeing Mr. Winkler as anyone other than ""The Fonz"" and while the younger generation may escape this mental time travel affliction, for me it's overpowering and makes every episode in which he appears just seem silly. I suspect Henry Winkler just may get his third shot at jumping the shark, how apropos that Boris had a shark hidden in a tank in season one; is it possible Henry Winkler was already tapped for the role of Hank and Evan's father? And speaking of silly, I'm actually afraid to see where the plot is headed since Hank accepted Boris' proposal. If the show survives this season, and I have my doubts, I believe it has one or two more seasons at the most.Boycotting the purchase of split seasons just to protest the splitting of seasons is not my style; I will however, stick to my budget and if I never get the third season of Royal Pains it's not much of a loss. I usually catch the episodes when they're on or watch on demand within a day or two; there's not much competition in the time slot with the current schedule but if something new and interesting comes along I may be switching my viewing plan.",2,"Okay show, lousy marketing plan splitting the season.",1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,2020,"[""'m"", 'collector', 'TV', 'shows', 'DVD', 'have', 'budget', 'hold', 'when', 'purchasing', 'season', 'will', 'not', 'pay', 'more', '1.00', 'episode', 'have', 'spent', 'years', 'waiting', 'catch', 'acceptable', 'price', 'shows', 'original', 'Avengers', 'example', 'have', 'managed', 'stay', 'set', 'budget', 'split', 'seasons', 'are', 'beginning', 'cause', 'problems', 'especially', 'when', 'split', 'uneven', 'Volume', 'one', 'Royal', 'Pains', 'season', 'three', 'ten', 'episodes', 'volume', 'two', 'only', 'six', 'Now', 'might', 'catch', 'volume', 'one', 'special', '9.99', 'maybe', 'holidays', 'do', 'really', 'think', 'price', 'volume', 'two', 'will', 'ever', 'drop', '6', 'less', 'show', 'started', 'lose', 'appeal', 'anyway', 'medical', 'parts', 'episodes', 'have', 'begun', 'be', 'bit', 'repetitious', 'cases', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'addition', 'iconic', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'Happy', 'Days', 'fame', 'actually', 'made', 'cringe', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'seeing', 'Mr.', 'Winkler', 'anyone', 'other', 'Fonz', 'younger', 'generation', 'may', 'escape', 'mental', 'time', 'travel', 'affliction', 'overpowering', 'episode', 'just', 'seem', 'silly', 'suspect', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'just', 'may', 'get', 'third', 'shot', 'jumping', 'shark', 'how', 'apropos', 'Boris', 'had', 'shark', 'hidden', 'tank', 'season', 'one', 'possible', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'was', 'already', 'tapped', 'role', 'Hank', 'Evan', 'father', 'speaking', 'silly', ""'m"", 'actually', 'afraid', 'see', 'where', 'plot', 'headed', 'Hank', 'accepted', 'Boris', 'proposal', 'show', 'season', 'have', 'doubts', 'believe', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'seasons', 'most.Boycotting', 'purchase', 'split', 'seasons', 'just', 'protest', 'splitting', 'seasons', 'not', 'style', 'will', 'however', 'stick', 'budget', 'never', 'get', 'third', 'season', 'Royal', 'Pains', 'not', 'much', 'loss', 'usually', 'catch', 'episodes', 'when', ""'re"", 'watch', 'demand', 'day', 'two', 'not', 'much', 'competition', 'time', 'slot', 'current', 'schedule', 'something', 'new', 'interesting', 'may', 'be', 'switching', 'viewing', 'plan']",Royal Pains: Season Three - Volume Two
