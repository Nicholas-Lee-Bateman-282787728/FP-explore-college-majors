1165436,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B001A94CSQ,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[6, 6]","""Bangkok Love Story"" (Thailand, 2007) tells the unusual and emotional story of the growing relationship between two street-smart macho young men running from gangsters in that steamy, dark city.Maek (referred to in subtitles as ""Cloud"") has become a hired killer to help support himself, his younger brother and mother, all three of whom are infected with HIV from his stepfather.  He justifies his mission as only killing ""bad"" people, and crosses the boss when he refuses to execute a handsome young man, Iht (""Stone""), who had gotten too close to exposing one gangster's operation.  Cloud gets shot during the getaway, and Stone nurses him back to health, while they hide in exile in the inner city.  Helping Cloud with his bath one day leads to the duo getting carried away, and Cloud can't deal with his feelings for Stone, banishing him from his life.  Most of the rest of the film involves Stone's attempts at reconciliation, as well as greater detail about Cloud's family, who suffer persecution due to their illness.A beautifully photographed and capably-acted film, which tells a simple story but tells it wonderfully and with great emotion (perhaps a bit too much for some critical viewers).  Won a couple of international film competitions. Dialogue in Thai with English subtitles, very easy to follow. DVD artwork is a bit misleading, as it shows the duo posing on a fancy, expensive sofa, while the entire film has them living in near squalor. DVD extras include several deleted scenes, which provide some additional background into the characters. Not rated, but would be a mild R due to violence, gay content and simulated sex; there is no complete nudity.

The weaving of crime and gunfire with homosexual lust and love is actually done rather well.  There is also a fair amount of quality cinematography.That said, some may find the depth of the characters a bit challenging at times.  Not quite an hour into the film, we're already doing a flashback of how a love affair started, and/or ended.  Nonetheless, the last 1/3 of the film is redeeming, so hang in there if you can.  I just wish the first part could have been a touch milder.In the end, you have a film about poverty, crime, murder, prostitution, rape, AIDS, family and love.  Make sure you watch the alternate ending in the DVD special features.  I'm not sure why it was cut - it genuinely garners emotion.

1165440,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001A94CSQ,Grady Harp,"[27, 27]","The cover of the DVD for this very fine film is misleading: the photograph of the two leads in a rather quiet and elegant setting is about as far from the content of the cinematic adventure as imaginable. Writer/Director Poj Amon has created a love story that is more from the underbelly of the poor section of Bangkok than it is from the expected physical beauty of that Thai city, and rather than focusing on the 'tourist view' of Thailand, he instead finds a different kind of beauty molded into a love story from a far different perspective. And it works very well.In the world of Thai organized  crime there is a star assassin - Maek ((Rattanaballang Tohssawat) - who kills 'bad people' to satisfy his bosses but cannot kill 'good people'.  He is the sole support of his mother and younger brother, both of whom suffer from AIDS - the source of their infection is the abusive live-in stepfather.  Maek wants to provide a good home for his little family, somewhere away from the slums of Bangkok, so that his little brother will no longer have to ply the hustler role on the streets to help support his ailing mother.  Maek is assigned a 'hit' and in stalking the young lawyer he is supposed to assassinate he finds an attraction to the obviously good, married, handsome Iht (Chaiwat Thongsaeng).  When the moment comes to complete his grim duty, Maek cannot kill a 'good man' and in the setup Maek himself is shot.  Iht is compassionate and rescues Maek from the streets, taking him to his shelter to nurse him back to health.  The two men bond and eventually submit to their passion.  Yet when Maek recovers, he cannot face the truth of his feelings and separates himself from Iht.  Iht's wife is suspicious about Iht's distance, stalks him, and witnesses a secret moment of passion between Maek and Iht, and the discovery turns her into a potential assassin herself. Iht is now by himself, unable to regain Maek's commitment until a series of events leads to the ultimate arrest of Maek: from the imposed separation caused by Maek's incarceration, Iht remains faithful to his love.  The ending could have been triumphant (and for moments it is, emotionally), but instead  Poj Amon opts for tragedy, a writer's decision that makes the film even more powerful.The cast of actors is excellent and the chemistry between the two leads is undiluted by the forces that are meant to separate them. In the end, this is a love story between two classes of people whose discovery of a forbidden love emphasizes some universal truths. It is a well-made, beautifully photographed film (Tiwa Moeithaisong is the gifted cinematographer)  that deserves a wider audience.

Maek (played by Rattanaballang Tohssawat) is the assassin capable only of killing the bad guys. Iht (Chaiwat Thongsaeng) is his target, the lawyer a crime gang wants murdered.The film is visually stunning, as is Chaiwat Thongsaeng as Iht. I could watch him watching paint dry all day long and not get bored. But as for the plot... Oh dear.I desperately wanted to like this film. There was so much potential; the idea itself is a bit different - a gay version of Asian action flicks. But the melodrama puts Brazilian telenovellas to shame. It isn't enough that Maek's brother is a hustler who happily passes on the AIDS given to him by his paedophile stepfather, the mother is also infected, and eventually hangs herself. Oh and so does the brother, after a slow, lingering decline into AIDS hell. It isn't enough that Maek gets locked up for most of his life; when he finally gets out, he's gunned down. That's after Iht, who's been blinded by the widow of one of Maek's victims, has waited a lifetime for him. And because it's in a rainstorm, poor blind Iht doesn't realise Maek's been shot dead, and carries on talking about how much he loves Maek, and how Maek will be his new eyes from now on. Then a Hummer runs over both of them. (No, not really, but it might as well have done.)The first half of the film, particularly the scenes in which Maek and Iht slowly fall in love - and lust, culminating in a steamy rooftop love scene - is promising. But it goes downhill rapidly, plummets of a cliff and is blown to smithereens as one tragedy tops another.
