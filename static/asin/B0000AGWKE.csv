762957,A928WN8NV03WZ,B0000AGWKE,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[24, 25]","This was a big change from the campy season before and the surreal set of movies that happened in the season one.  The episodes in season 2 were like Red Dwarf.  Where they seemed to bounce randomly from one spot to another, and had little in realm of a long running plot until the later seasons.  Season two was a random bunch of episodes with only Mantrid and the Lexx crew binding them together.This season not only had a long running story arc, but the humor was more subdued and focused on the surreal imagery and spiritual idealogies it presented.The crew was shot into the dark zone after the destruction of the light zone.  You find that they were stranded in an empty area with no planets nearby, and no fuel for their ship.  So they go into sleep and drift until they find a decent planet.  But they are found before they have a chance to wake, but a strange individual named Prince.  He and his roadwarrior like lackeys take Stan prisoner and becomes interested in Xev.  He takes them to Princetown, his town on Fire.Fire and Water are a pair of planets that circle each other and share atmosphere that can be traversed by balloons.  Fire is hot and unable to sustain life on the surface.  So the towns are tall stacks that lift them high enough to make it livable.  The areas below are filled with devices to keep the city cool by using slave labor.  Water is all water, dotted with towns on the surface.  The inhabitants are all living in luxury, giving little thought to the world around them, the future, or the past.  They seem to live for the moment and whatever passion drives them.  The towns on both planets are named for their leaders or their obsession, Gametown is filled with sports fanatics, Garden with the plant obsessed, Girltown is a matriarchy, and Boomtown where everyone has sex all the time.But that isn't the end of the weirdness.  People seem to have little recallation of the past or who they are.  No one is born, they just remember when they were and nothing else.  The two planets have been fighting for ages but don't know why.  The crew see quite a few people that they knew in the Light Universe that are all dead, some with the same names.  They see Bunny, Schlemi, Mantrid, and Gigarotta that have no memories of their previous lives.  Plus Prince seems to know the most, but has his own agenda and is obsessed with getting the crew to fullfill this.I didn't like this season when I first saw it, but it grew on me.  The humor was more subtle, darker, and surreal than the first one.  It was also more philosphical and spiritual than the previous series.  Dealing with re incarnation, planetary genocide, damnation, and eternal paradise.  The big bad wasn't standard as he wasn't out to kill the crew or the universe.  But he admitted repeatedly that he was neither good nor trustworthy, but wanted to make a deal.  plus he was harder to figure out than the other two, and even by the time the series is over you still don't know for certain what he is.This was a great season that tends to grow on you.  The imagery and well thought out plot was worth the price alone.",5,Great Season,1095638400,"09 20, 2004",2004,3113,"['was', 'big', 'change', 'campy', 'season', 'surreal', 'set', 'movies', 'happened', 'season', 'one', 'episodes', 'season', '2', 'were', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'Where', 'seemed', 'bounce', 'randomly', 'one', 'spot', 'had', 'little', 'realm', 'long', 'running', 'plot', 'later', 'seasons', 'Season', 'two', 'was', 'random', 'bunch', 'episodes', 'only', 'Mantrid', 'Lexx', 'crew', 'binding', 'together.This', 'season', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'long', 'running', 'story', 'arc', 'humor', 'was', 'more', 'subdued', 'focused', 'surreal', 'imagery', 'spiritual', 'idealogies', 'presented.The', 'crew', 'was', 'shot', 'dark', 'zone', 'destruction', 'light', 'zone', 'find', 'were', 'stranded', 'empty', 'area', 'planets', 'nearby', 'fuel', 'ship', 'go', 'sleep', 'drift', 'find', 'decent', 'planet', 'are', 'found', 'have', 'chance', 'wake', 'strange', 'individual', 'named', 'Prince', 'roadwarrior', 'lackeys', 'take', 'Stan', 'prisoner', 'becomes', 'interested', 'Xev', 'Princetown', 'town', 'Fire.Fire', 'Water', 'are', 'pair', 'planets', 'circle', 'other', 'share', 'atmosphere', 'can', 'be', 'traversed', 'balloons', 'Fire', 'hot', 'unable', 'sustain', 'life', 'surface', 'towns', 'are', 'tall', 'stacks', 'lift', 'high', 'enough', 'make', 'livable', 'areas', 'are', 'filled', 'devices', 'keep', 'city', 'cool', 'using', 'slave', 'labor', 'Water', 'water', 'dotted', 'towns', 'surface', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'living', 'luxury', 'giving', 'little', 'thought', 'world', 'future', 'past', 'seem', 'live', 'moment', 'passion', 'towns', 'planets', 'are', 'named', 'leaders', 'obsession', 'Gametown', 'filled', 'sports', 'fanatics', 'Garden', 'plant', 'obsessed', 'Girltown', 'matriarchy', 'Boomtown', 'where', 'everyone', 'sex', 'time.But', ""n't"", 'end', 'weirdness', 'People', 'seem', 'have', 'little', 'recallation', 'past', 'who', 'are', 'one', 'born', 'just', 'remember', 'when', 'were', 'nothing', 'else', 'two', 'planets', 'have', 'been', 'fighting', 'ages', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'crew', 'see', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'knew', 'Light', 'Universe', 'are', 'dead', 'same', 'names', 'see', 'Bunny', 'Schlemi', 'Mantrid', 'Gigarotta', 'have', 'memories', 'previous', 'lives', 'Prince', 'know', 'most', 'own', 'agenda', 'obsessed', 'getting', 'crew', 'fullfill', 'this.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'season', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'grew', 'humor', 'was', 'more', 'subtle', 'darker', 'surreal', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'also', 'more', 'philosphical', 'spiritual', 'previous', 'series', 'Dealing', 're', 'incarnation', 'planetary', 'genocide', 'damnation', 'eternal', 'paradise', 'big', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'standard', 'was', ""n't"", 'out', 'kill', 'crew', 'universe', 'admitted', 'repeatedly', 'was', 'neither', 'good', 'trustworthy', 'wanted', 'make', 'deal', 'was', 'harder', 'figure', 'out', 'other', 'two', 'even', 'time', 'series', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'certain', 'what', 'was', 'great', 'season', 'grow', 'imagery', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'plot', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'alone']",N/A

762964,AVCRD98TH48RN,B0000AGWKE,D. Knouse,"[18, 18]","This third season was where I was initiated with ""The Lexx.""  I came in completely bewildered and at the same time fascinated by what I was seeing.  I consider this show to be one of the most original sci-fi programs ever created, and this third series continues that tradition with some excellent computer graphics and bizarre yet mesmerizing scenarios.  What is different in this series as compared to the last is that while the second series was a collection of twenty singular episodes with a through-line plot, this third series is more like a single, long adventure story in 13 parts.  There are very few moments in this series that I thought the story was meandering or losing focus of the motivations of the main characters.  Also, many of the new character actors are superb.  All give memorable performances, with a particularly enthralling performance from Nigel Bennett who plays the character ""Prince.""  While the surreal, often nightmarish, story unfolds there is an underlying mystery that is gradually revealed.  The ""Making of..."" section on the DVDs are both informative and entertaining with shots taken from filming on location in Berlin, as well as on the sound stages in Nova Scotia.  This third series is an epic adventure that stands on its own once the main characters become familiar.  Newcomers to ""The Lexx"" should start with the original first series which consists of four 2-hour-long films for a more detailed backstory.  The second series also has some great moments and is certainly worth obtaining, as well.  This third series should be watched as a whole, and that is why I chose not to write reviews for each particular volume.

The planets are called 'Water' and 'Fire'. I do not think there is aneed to describe what the planets are like. Needless to say Fire invades Water occasionallyusing balloons. There's a joke there, somewhere, but I will restrain myself.I have to say symbolism and sexiness run amok in these episode as the gallant three, Xev, Kaiand Stanley are split up and have individual adventures. Don't get too deep into the meaningbecause perhaps all three will return to Lexx and travel onward. Or not. Leave the depth findersto the sonar intelligentsia and just enjoy the ride.

LEXX excelled those standards in its 3rd year of stories, or rather, the third adventure.  Whereas the four television movies established the origins of the Lexx and crew, and the 2nd series was a typical year of science fiction television, year 3 delved into a strong, never-disappointing subject matter - the elemental rules of good and evil and cause and effect.Thousands of years adrift, the Lexx has almost no power and cannot escape the shared orbit of planets Fire and Water.  The  inhabitants of both planets have opposing ideals and ways of life, and some of them look familiar. Both planets would also make a good snack for the Lexx - but which one?  Here is where our favorite motley crew will come face to face with who they really are, and what they really want.This show has got it all, and the actors are PERFECT for these characters.

On this one, we actually discover a wide-range of new, strange, bizarre and original worlds and locations. OH YES.It's ten times more entertaining, creative and imaginative than every other sci-fi series out there, except maybe for Farscape which I also bought the complete series and will begin watching when I'm done with Lexx.Really though, I know some effects aren't good but if you can get past that then this is by far the best sci-fi series you'll get. With every new episode they dare to go even further instead of spending 99% of the episode inside the ship like all sci-fi series do and it's just so original you can't help but be enthralled by it.You've got so many spots on the journey: they go to The Cluster, to Brunnis, to Pattern, then to Mantrid's Ice Planet, MedStat (space hospital), Luvliner (space brothel), TV World, the space jury, 791's industrial planet, Nook, Ruuma and then Woz, and that's only until season 2. Then you've got the BEST season which is S3 with the epic saga between the Fire & Water planets and its entire metaphysical plot about Heaven & Hell, plus all locations on Earth in the 4th season, like the stylish Transylvania episodes and the tropical beach in Xevivor, to name a few.Lexx has something going for it that's rare and even exciting: it's just so damn imaginative. The plot can be hard to follow, the acting isn't always great, and the direction can seem pallid at times... but the art direction and just basic inventiveness and originality are remarkable. What Lexx does so well that few others shows can do is introduce you to a completely new world, something so fresh and bizarre that you can watch the same episode several times in different moods and have different experiences as a result.And again, the art direction is ASTOUNDING: there are many scenes in this show, particularly the first and third season, that if frozen as a still and mounted as a poster would be better than the art in most people's homes. Lexx is like nothing you have ever seen before, or will again. It's very, very hard to describe it. You have to see it for yourself. You'll either hate it or, like me, join thousands who still think this is a series way ahead of its time, and the best & most underrated and underseen sci-fi to have ever graced the little screen.",5,Lexx is by far the best & most underrated sci-fi ever.,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,2485,"['How', '*beep*', ""n't"", 'more', 'famous', 'ATTENTION', 'TO', 'ALL', 'SCI-FI', 'FANS', 'LOOKING', 'FOR', 'AN', 'AMAZING', 'SHOW', 'ONE', 'show', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', '99', '%', 'time', 'talking', 'spaceship', 'one', 'actually', 'discover', 'wide-range', 'new', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'original', 'worlds', 'locations', 'OH', 'YES.It', 'ten', 'times', 'more', 'entertaining', 'creative', 'imaginative', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'there', 'maybe', 'Farscape', 'also', 'bought', 'complete', 'series', 'will', 'begin', 'watching', 'when', ""'m"", 'done', 'Lexx.Really', 'know', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'can', 'get', 'then', 'far', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'series', ""'ll"", 'get', 'new', 'episode', 'dare', 'go', 'even', 'further', 'instead', 'spending', '99', '%', 'episode', 'ship', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'do', 'just', 'so', 'original', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'enthralled', 'it.You', ""'ve"", 'got', 'so', 'many', 'spots', 'journey', 'go', 'Cluster', 'Brunnis', 'Pattern', 'then', 'Mantrid', 'Ice', 'Planet', 'MedStat', 'space', 'hospital', 'Luvliner', 'space', 'brothel', 'TV', 'World', 'space', 'jury', '791', 'industrial', 'planet', 'Nook', 'Ruuma', 'then', 'Woz', 'only', 'season', '2', 'Then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'BEST', 'season', 'S3', 'epic', 'saga', 'Fire', 'Water', 'planets', 'entire', 'metaphysical', 'plot', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'locations', 'Earth', '4th', 'season', 'stylish', 'Transylvania', 'episodes', 'tropical', 'beach', 'Xevivor', 'name', 'few.Lexx', 'something', 'going', 'rare', 'even', 'exciting', 'just', 'so', 'damn', 'imaginative', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'follow', 'acting', ""n't"", 'always', 'great', 'direction', 'can', 'seem', 'pallid', 'times', 'art', 'direction', 'just', 'basic', 'inventiveness', 'originality', 'are', 'remarkable', 'What', 'Lexx', 'so', 'well', 'few', 'others', 'shows', 'can', 'do', 'introduce', 'completely', 'new', 'world', 'something', 'so', 'fresh', 'bizarre', 'can', 'watch', 'same', 'episode', 'several', 'times', 'different', 'moods', 'have', 'different', 'experiences', 'result.And', 'again', 'art', 'direction', 'ASTOUNDING', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'show', 'particularly', 'first', 'third', 'season', 'frozen', 'still', 'mounted', 'poster', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'art', 'most', 'people', 'homes', 'Lexx', 'nothing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'before', 'will', 'again', 'very', 'very', 'hard', 'describe', 'have', 'see', ""'ll"", 'either', 'hate', 'join', 'thousands', 'who', 'still', 'think', 'series', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'best', 'most', 'underrated', 'underseen', 'sci-fi', 'have', 'ever', 'graced', 'little', 'screen']",N/A

They put themselves into cryo chambers with 790 watching the bridge.  As the season opens, four-thousand years have passed and the Lexx is very hungry and unable to fly.  They are stuck between two planets that share a common atmosphere.  These are the planets Fire and Water.  Fire is a roasting desert with tower cities and Water is a ball of water with floating cities.  The only apparent source of food for Lexx is one of the planets.  Travel to either planet is easy using a moth or a balloon.But these two planets are strange in other ways as well.  People, particularly the ruler of Fire, don't stay dead.  There are no children and no one seems to know what they are.  Fire keeps trying to conquer Water as it has all of the resources.  Prince, the leader of Fire, is particularly interested in the crew and keeps trying to get them to blow up Water.  Eventually the true nature of the planets is revealed and the crew need to make some tough decisions on how to handle things.  The final episode ends with the crew heading for their next adventure.This season is a single story in thirteen parts.  This can make it seem like things are not moving very fast at times.  Two episodes, Gametown and Boomtown, have huge amounts of nudity but most are similar to the previous season.  The strange nature of the planets, and some flashbacks, enable us to see many characters we thought were long gone from the show (you have to watch to find out who).  Our main characters also undergo some changes.  Right at the start 790 switches its affection from Zev/Xev to Kai.  Kai is colder, more machine-like, and rather indestructible.  Xev goes through quite a few mood changes.  Stanley is the most stable although he does manage to get lucky in a couple of episodes.All in all it was an interesting season but quite different from what has gone before.  Fire is populated by very industrial images (even the balloon gondolas seem to be heavy steel) which is a change from the more organic look of previous seasons.  Overall I felt it was a little slow in parts and too much time seemed to be spent with part of the crew looking for a missing member.  I think the Fire and Water story could probably have been done in five or six episodes but then I was not in charge.  Each disk contains part of a Making Of special for the season.

Think about this: THEY COULDN'T NUMBER THE DISCS- At least one disc (4) has a whopping ten episodes crammed onto it!

In fact they look better than Season 1 & 2 due to being filmed digitally. Star Trek the next Generation was filmed on Tape, Lexx season 1 & 2 were filmed on Tape. Season 3 & 4 were filmed digitally and transfered to Tape. Which is also the reason you will never see HD versions of this series, the same way you don't see HD versions of Star Trek TNG.With a modern DVD player and TV you shouldn't have any over-scan and if you do it's a simple matter of adjusting your Picture size. I was disappointed about the Episode labels missing from the disks, as they were labeled on Season 1 & 2. That's easily resolved by looking under the Echo Bridge logo at the Numbers, the numbers get higher in value which is how you can tell. Also by default they are in order, so it's a simple matter of labeling them with a marker. Problem is resolved with a marker as the Episodes are labeled on the back of the box.It also should be noted that even though this is Echo Bridge, the same people that bring you VHS quality to DVD (ugh) they actually did an OK job on this. Also Season 3 & 4 look better than Season 2 and in fact the quality is the same as I originally watched it on TV. If it looks better from some OOP (Out of Print) copy, it's probably artificial enhancements. And since those other copies are OOP, you can pay $10 for the Echo Bridge season 3 & 4; or you can pay almost $50+ for an OOP copy of just Season 3 -- nevermind Season 4. I've seen it as high as $100 in some places. Is it worth $100 for Lexx? Not for me and since Echo Bridge now owns distribution rights, you better get use to it or just forget about it.

Just putting a dang number on each disc would have been a great improvement.  The episode lists are on the disc, and a serial number that is in order with the shows, but a simple &#34;disc 1 of 5&#34; would have gotten this an extra star rating.  And a season number would be nice too.  As for the show, season 3 was excellent and told a great story.  Season 4 seemed more like a sit-com.  Both seasons were entertaining, but in very different ways.  Glad I bought the cheaper version of this show.  I was hoping for more of the season 3 type sci-fi.

This season's adversary is (Isombard [sp?]) Prince, a constant tempter and trickster who dies a lot and will not stay dead. Paced rather like a comic strip or a soap opera sometimes, so certain episodes have very little happening. Even so, you have to watch all 13 episodes to get the full impact of this very long story.All of ""Lexx"" 's previous strengths continue here, more drama now than comedy, with shifting characterizations and changing alliances, and the first hints of the show's guest cast entering multiple roles, for those who've watched the whole series so far. (also includes more fun recognizable guest cast, too)As it turns out, this season is just the first portion of the rest of the series, to be concluded in the 24 episodes of the next season.Slightly easier packaging than the other ""Lexx"" sets, and again, no extras.",3,One long story of Two Allegorical Planets,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,1095,"['Now', 'Dark', 'Zone', 'Lexx', 'crew', 'are', 'awakened', '3750-ish', 'years', 'must', 'be', 'kind', 'TV', 'SF', 'record', 'binary', 'system', 'planets', 'Fire', 'Water', 'towns', 'equally', 'allegorical', 'names', 'satirical', 'functions', 'more', 'farcical', 'others', 'season', 'adversary', 'Isombard', '[', 'sp', ']', 'Prince', 'constant', 'tempter', 'trickster', 'who', 'lot', 'will', 'not', 'stay', 'dead', 'Paced', 'rather', 'comic', 'strip', 'soap', 'opera', 'sometimes', 'so', 'certain', 'episodes', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'happening', 'Even', 'so', 'have', 'watch', '13', 'episodes', 'get', 'full', 'impact', 'very', 'long', 'story.All', 'Lexx', 'previous', 'strengths', 'continue', 'here', 'more', 'drama', 'now', 'comedy', 'shifting', 'characterizations', 'changing', 'alliances', 'first', 'hints', 'show', 'guest', 'cast', 'entering', 'multiple', 'roles', 'who', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'also', 'more', 'fun', 'recognizable', 'guest', 'cast', 'too', 'out', 'season', 'just', 'first', 'portion', 'rest', 'series', 'be', 'concluded', '24', 'episodes', 'next', 'season.Slightly', 'easier', 'packaging', 'other', 'Lexx', 'sets', 'again', 'extras']",N/A
