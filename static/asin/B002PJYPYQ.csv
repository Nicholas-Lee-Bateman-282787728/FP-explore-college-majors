I knew that Give Me Your Hand followed a couple of short films by Pascal Alex-Vincent - mainly because these shorts, Baby Shark and Final Exams are bonus material on this DVD.  In fact, the DVD is quite rich in bonus material, it also boasts a Making Of featurette, Deleted Scenes and a Question and Answer session with the director and the Carril twins. But what I most enjoyed about the film was the soundtrack by the group Tarwater - it's haunting and lyrical - just as the film is occasionally lyrical, with its static, well composed photography.But this film is no masterpiece.  And it is virtually devoid of gay interest, no matter what the hyperbole on the DVD cover might suggest.  I found this film a fairly hollow experience - with more than a couple of irritating episodes. But the photography is excellent, the twins are quite photogenic and the bonus material suggests a far more important work than we have here.This film is not just another road movie. Unfortunately, the script is half baked, the central premise, that twins can be inexplicably different is less than compelling and as an earlier reviewer remarked, one scene (and a modest scene at that) does not a gay film make.And the film runs out of puff after about 72 minutes, so the bonus shorts are appreciated.",3,Give me your bland,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,1316,"['Pablo', 'Juarez', 'ahead', 'knew', 'Give', 'Me', 'Your', 'Hand', 'followed', 'couple', 'short', 'films', 'Pascal', 'Alex-Vincent', 'mainly', 'shorts', 'Baby', 'Shark', 'Final', 'Exams', 'are', 'bonus', 'material', 'DVD', 'fact', 'DVD', 'quite', 'rich', 'bonus', 'material', 'also', 'Making', 'featurette', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'Question', 'Answer', 'session', 'director', 'Carril', 'twins', 'what', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'soundtrack', 'group', 'Tarwater', 'haunting', 'lyrical', 'just', 'film', 'occasionally', 'lyrical', 'static', 'well', 'composed', 'photography.But', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'virtually', 'devoid', 'gay', 'interest', 'matter', 'what', 'hyperbole', 'DVD', 'cover', 'might', 'suggest', 'found', 'film', 'fairly', 'hollow', 'experience', 'more', 'couple', 'irritating', 'episodes', 'photography', 'excellent', 'twins', 'are', 'quite', 'photogenic', 'bonus', 'material', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'work', 'have', 'here.This', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'road', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'half', 'baked', 'central', 'premise', 'twins', 'can', 'be', 'inexplicably', 'different', 'less', 'compelling', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'remarked', 'one', 'scene', 'modest', 'scene', 'not', 'gay', 'film', 'make.And', 'film', 'puff', '72', 'minutes', 'bonus', 'shorts', 'are', 'appreciated']",Give Me Your Hand
1283009,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B002PJYPYQ,Arcadio Bolaos,"[1, 1]","Antoine and Quentin are twin brothers. They're both young, determined and stubborn. Planning to assist to their mother's funeral, they embark on a journey to Spain. Hitchhiking, walking, illegally breaking their way into cargo trains, their trip becomes longer and harder than expected.Antoine, however, manages to find some pleasure thanks to the girls he finds on the road. Sexual intercourse seems to be Antoine's privilege, as Quentin remains isolated and totally immersed in his drawings. Even so, the twin brothers seem to share a special bond. Closeness and intimacy, at first, seem to come natural to them.They almost embody the idealized brotherly relationship as seen in Sophocles Antigone. Antoine and Quentin are 'autadelphos' to the extreme, not only have they shared the mother's womb but they also share every physical trait, identical to one another in physical appearance they are completely different in everything else. According to Saussure's linguistics, these brothers would only be able to articulate themselves into the symbolic order by functioning as mutually supplementary properties. Here the signifier (the body) is the same, but the signified (the personality) is completely different.The hardships of the excursion take a toll on the brother's already strained relationship. But even after constant fighting, they agree on working in a farm the necessary days to pay for a train ticket to Spain. One night, Quentin finds in the fields a young man that looks very interested in him. They go skinny dipping and afterwards they have sex in the middle of the woods. Antoine, worried about his brother's absence goes out looking for him and finds him naked with the other boy.With a mindset conquered by the heterosexual normativity, Antoine is unable to cope with the fact that his brother is homosexual. In the classic Greek tragedy, Antigone confirms that she loves her brother despise he was a traitor to Thebes, she reaffirms ""My brother is what he is"", and she loves him even more than life itself. He is what he is. And she accepts him for it. Antoine, however, cannot accept homosexuality, he can't see his brother as he is. And so, a few hours after the fateful encounter, he betrays his brother.While eating in town, a man approaches Antoine, trying to seduce him. He quickly tells the man that for 100 euros he can have his brother, who is already waiting in the bathroom. The man pays and goes into the bathroom, and abusively tries to undress Quentin, who defends as best as he can. Antoine leaves the place and returns afterwards, only to find his brother's backpack on the bathroom's floor. He is nowhere to be found and it's only then when Antoine realizes what he has done.Relationships amongst brothers are always complicated, there is much love and hate, constant conflicts, but usually nothing escalates as dangerously as it happens in Pascal-Alex Vincent's film. Antoine has a ghastly nightmare: he sees Quentin covered in blood. He starts feeling guilty, and he starts remembering other occasions in which he had purposefully neglected his brother.He has but one choice: to keep traveling to Spain. Just before reaching his mother's town, he runs into Angel, a young man that tries to help him (curiously, Angel is played by Fernando Ramallo, famous for his interpretation of a gay teenager in Krampack); finally he arrives on time for the memorial. It's only fitting that the possibility of the brother's death is bound to the mother's funeral. It all boils down to Lacan's symbolic death. The burial place is the first symbol in which humanity can reorganize itself. Animals live and die anonymously, so to speak. For humans, unity and irreplaceability must be protected and remembered through language, that's why we speak of the dead, why we erect monuments and place tombstones, thus creating what Lacan called ""a second death"" that pertains to the order of the symbolic.The final scenes of ""Donne-moi la main"" are unforgettable because of the lack of communication, loneliness and true desperation that the director transmits with strong images. At the beginning of the film, we had two brothers trusting in each other, sharing their frustrations and joys, expressing their feelings not through conventional language but rather through gestures, physical contact, silences and movement. At the end of the film all that remains is bereft, loss, rage and violence.",4,"""My brother is what he is""",1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,4416,"['Antoine', 'Quentin', 'are', 'twin', 'brothers', ""'re"", 'young', 'determined', 'stubborn', 'Planning', 'assist', 'mother', 'funeral', 'embark', 'journey', 'Spain', 'Hitchhiking', 'walking', 'illegally', 'breaking', 'way', 'cargo', 'trains', 'trip', 'becomes', 'longer', 'harder', 'expected.Antoine', 'however', 'find', 'pleasure', 'thanks', 'girls', 'road', 'Sexual', 'intercourse', 'be', 'Antoine', 'privilege', 'Quentin', 'isolated', 'totally', 'immersed', 'drawings', 'Even', 'so', 'twin', 'brothers', 'seem', 'share', 'special', 'bond', 'Closeness', 'intimacy', 'first', 'seem', 'come', 'natural', 'them.They', 'almost', 'embody', 'idealized', 'brotherly', 'relationship', 'seen', 'Sophocles', 'Antigone', 'Antoine', 'Quentin', 'are', ""'autadelphos"", 'extreme', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'shared', 'mother', 'womb', 'also', 'share', 'physical', 'trait', 'identical', 'one', 'physical', 'appearance', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'everything', 'else', 'According', 'Saussure', 'linguistics', 'brothers', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'able', 'articulate', 'symbolic', 'order', 'functioning', 'mutually', 'supplementary', 'properties', 'Here', 'signifier', 'body', 'same', 'signified', 'personality', 'completely', 'different.The', 'hardships', 'excursion', 'take', 'toll', 'brother', 'already', 'strained', 'relationship', 'even', 'constant', 'fighting', 'agree', 'working', 'farm', 'necessary', 'days', 'pay', 'train', 'ticket', 'Spain', 'One', 'night', 'Quentin', 'fields', 'young', 'man', 'very', 'interested', 'go', 'skinny', 'dipping', 'afterwards', 'have', 'sex', 'middle', 'woods', 'Antoine', 'worried', 'brother', 'absence', 'out', 'looking', 'naked', 'other', 'boy.With', 'mindset', 'conquered', 'heterosexual', 'normativity', 'Antoine', 'unable', 'cope', 'fact', 'brother', 'homosexual', 'classic', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'Antigone', 'brother', 'despise', 'was', 'traitor', 'Thebes', 'brother', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'life', 'what', 'Antoine', 'however', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'homosexuality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'brother', 'so', 'few', 'hours', 'fateful', 'encounter', 'brother.While', 'eating', 'town', 'man', 'Antoine', 'trying', 'seduce', 'quickly', 'man', '100', 'euros', 'can', 'have', 'brother', 'who', 'already', 'waiting', 'bathroom', 'man', 'bathroom', 'abusively', 'tries', 'undress', 'Quentin', 'who', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'Antoine', 'place', 'returns', 'afterwards', 'only', 'find', 'brother', 'backpack', 'bathroom', 'floor', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'only', 'then', 'when', 'Antoine', 'what', 'done.Relationships', 'brothers', 'are', 'always', 'complicated', 'much', 'love', 'hate', 'constant', 'conflicts', 'usually', 'nothing', 'as', 'dangerously', 'Pascal-Alex', 'Vincent', 'film', 'Antoine', 'ghastly', 'nightmare', 'Quentin', 'covered', 'blood', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'remembering', 'other', 'occasions', 'had', 'purposefully', 'neglected', 'brother.He', 'one', 'choice', 'keep', 'traveling', 'Spain', 'Just', 'reaching', 'mother', 'town', 'Angel', 'young', 'man', 'help', 'curiously', 'Angel', 'played', 'Fernando', 'Ramallo', 'famous', 'interpretation', 'gay', 'teenager', 'Krampack', 'finally', 'time', 'memorial', 'only', 'fitting', 'possibility', 'brother', 'death', 'bound', 'mother', 'funeral', 'down', 'Lacan', 'symbolic', 'death', 'burial', 'place', 'first', 'symbol', 'humanity', 'can', 'reorganize', 'Animals', 'live', 'die', 'anonymously', 'so', 'speak', 'humans', 'unity', 'irreplaceability', 'must', 'be', 'protected', 'remembered', 'language', 'why', 'speak', 'dead', 'why', 'erect', 'monuments', 'place', 'tombstones', 'thus', 'creating', 'what', 'Lacan', 'called', 'second', 'death', 'order', 'symbolic.The', 'final', 'scenes', 'Donne-moi', 'la', 'main', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'lack', 'communication', 'loneliness', 'true', 'desperation', 'director', 'strong', 'images', 'beginning', 'film', 'had', 'two', 'brothers', 'trusting', 'other', 'sharing', 'frustrations', 'joys', 'expressing', 'feelings', 'not', 'conventional', 'language', 'rather', 'gestures', 'physical', 'contact', 'silences', 'movement', 'end', 'film', 'bereft', 'loss', 'rage', 'violence']",Give Me Your Hand

It is really not a ""gay film,"" but one that gays might find appealing.Antoine (with the slice in his eyebrow) is obviously the brother not unwilling to fight, and Quentin is the artist and insecure, sensitive one. Quentin attracts a girl to join them, but Antoine is the one that has relations with her, and it clearly upsets Quentin. As Antoine washes his privates in a stream afterwards Quentin watches and seethes. (I saw nothing homoerotic in this. Clearly both have seen each other naked all their lives.) Likewise Antoine refuses to share the last of the girl's cakes. He is the bully of the two. When they both get lucky with a pair of girls in an old Citroen Deux Chevaux it is Antoine who has sex in the car while Quentin only makes out with his girl, in a tree.In the ""homosexual"" encounter with Hakim we never actually see the men kiss. They cavort naked in a stream and lie down together on the bank of the river. It is not clear that sex actually occurs, either. Hakim could be kissing Quentin's back as he hangs from a tree limb. In any case, it is clear after Antoine, in anger over Hakim, puts Quentin in harm's way, and is separated from him, that he is literally sickened by what he has done. He carries his brothers backpack, and calls out his name from a mountaintop. He even finds no pleasure with a woman whom he probably would have seduced, had the brothers still been together.His relief in seeing his brother at the funeral is palpable. And Quentin's fear in the final frames when he thinks Antoine is lost, is just as powerful. There is clearly love between them. And a desire to separate, but a need to be together. Many twins experience this, even developing a twin's language. To me there was plenty of emotion for two young men. Watch the eyes. Not a perfect film, but hardly boring. By the way, the blond Spanish man who gives Antoine a ride is the guy who played Dani in the film Nico and Dani years ago, a similar tale of two friends who engage in sex play together as boys but grow apart when one realizes that the other actually has a crush on him. Not unlike what Antoine might feel, knowing his brother's apparent nature.",4,Twins who maybe wish they weren't,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,2299,"['****', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', '****I', 'watched', 'film', 'Give', 'Me', 'Your', 'Hand', 'DVD', 'last', 'night', 'find', 'more', 'agreement', 'Lassen', 'not', 'really', 'really', 'not', 'gay', 'film', 'one', 'might', 'find', 'appealing.Antoine', 'slice', 'eyebrow', 'obviously', 'brother', 'not', 'unwilling', 'fight', 'Quentin', 'artist', 'insecure', 'sensitive', 'one', 'Quentin', 'girl', 'join', 'Antoine', 'one', 'relations', 'clearly', 'Quentin', 'Antoine', 'washes', 'privates', 'stream', 'afterwards', 'Quentin', 'watches', 'seethes', 'saw', 'nothing', 'homoerotic', 'Clearly', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'naked', 'lives', 'Likewise', 'Antoine', 'share', 'last', 'girl', 'cakes', 'bully', 'two', 'When', 'get', 'lucky', 'pair', 'girls', 'old', 'Citroen', 'Deux', 'Chevaux', 'Antoine', 'who', 'sex', 'car', 'Quentin', 'only', 'out', 'girl', 'tree.In', 'homosexual', 'encounter', 'Hakim', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'men', 'kiss', 'cavort', 'naked', 'stream', 'lie', 'down', 'together', 'bank', 'river', 'not', 'clear', 'sex', 'actually', 'either', 'Hakim', 'could', 'be', 'kissing', 'Quentin', 'back', 'tree', 'limb', 'case', 'clear', 'Antoine', 'anger', 'Hakim', 'Quentin', 'harm', 'way', 'separated', 'literally', 'sickened', 'what', 'done', 'brothers', 'backpack', 'out', 'name', 'mountaintop', 'even', 'pleasure', 'woman', 'whom', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'seduced', 'had', 'brothers', 'still', 'been', 'together.His', 'relief', 'seeing', 'brother', 'funeral', 'palpable', 'Quentin', 'fear', 'final', 'frames', 'when', 'Antoine', 'lost', 'just', 'as', 'powerful', 'clearly', 'love', 'desire', 'separate', 'need', 'be', 'together', 'Many', 'twins', 'experience', 'even', 'developing', 'twin', 'language', 'was', 'plenty', 'emotion', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'Watch', 'eyes', 'Not', 'perfect', 'film', 'hardly', 'boring', 'way', 'blond', 'Spanish', 'man', 'who', 'Antoine', 'ride', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Dani', 'film', 'Nico', 'Dani', 'years', 'ago', 'similar', 'tale', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'engage', 'sex', 'play', 'together', 'boys', 'grow', 'apart', 'when', 'one', 'other', 'actually', 'crush', 'Not', 'what', 'Antoine', 'might', 'feel', 'knowing', 'brother', 'apparent', 'nature']",Give Me Your Hand

I had the privilege of knowing a set of twins and they were very passionate that their relationship/connection transcends Love as defined by society and that this Love is stronger then any other they have experienced in their lives (even the Love they have for their Parents, Husbands and Children does not compare to the Love they have for each other). It is a unique relationship that I think only Twins can truly understand, but they have gone as far as to say that they feel they are  of the same soul and they only feel complete when they are together.

1283022,AMWIK6JOWNTHK,B002PJYPYQ,Kurt Clare,"[8, 9]","Antoine and Quentin (Alexandre and Victor Carril) have an amorphous relationship which seems to go from one extreme to another, and yet they are intrinsically linked. From open aggression, hostility and violence, they move to genuine intimacy and affection, and as twins seem to know each other's thoughts without the need for verbalisation. This within itself is remarkably portrayed by the French Director (Pascal-Alex Vincent) who seems to traverse the need for scripting, and relies almost exclusively on the natural dynamism that exists between the twins themselves.True to French cinema the story is dynamic, morphing from casual commentary to a more intense social observation on relationships, sexuality and the fluidity of youth. The movie starts with an interesting twist, in that the brothers despite being twins seem to have a different relationship with their father. One works with him in the family bakery, whilst the other exists on the periphery. It is he who precipitates their escape, and without much thought both brothers make a hasty, unplanned escape. Their purpose is simple in that they wish to attend their mother's funeral in Spain. Ironically they know nothing of her, and have never had a relationship with her or their father. Nothing much is said of this family dynamic, but enough is made of its dysfunctional and fragmented nature, as well as its impact. Perhaps it is for this reason that the brothers find comfort and identity within each other, despite obvious differences and the need to assert one's self in the world.Without much money, the brothers are forced to rely on fate, which in turn is both cruel and graceful. Sex seems to be functional, and normative morality (as expressed within American culture) seems to be absent from these intimate interactions. Yet one brother finds himself feeling more than just lustful frivolity, when allowing himself a brief intimacy with another young man. This poignant expression of both rebellion and curiosity, makes for a powerful interlude within the broader story. It entices and frees the young man, opening him to something he has never really experienced. The intimacy and affection he feels however, is overpowered by the enormous influence of his brother.This is a visually powerful movie, both in its imagery and its expression. Similarly, it is a powerful expression of brotherly love, often without dialogue or expressed intention. Yet it is also passionate, evolving and with some emotional jarring.Well worth a moment of your life.",4,"Poignant, visually beautiful and yet different.",1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,2528,"['Antoine', 'Quentin', 'Alexandre', 'Victor', 'Carril', 'have', 'amorphous', 'relationship', 'go', 'one', 'extreme', 'yet', 'are', 'intrinsically', 'linked', 'open', 'aggression', 'hostility', 'violence', 'move', 'genuine', 'intimacy', 'affection', 'twins', 'seem', 'know', 'other', 'thoughts', 'need', 'verbalisation', 'remarkably', 'portrayed', 'French', 'Director', 'Pascal-Alex', 'Vincent', 'who', 'traverse', 'need', 'scripting', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'natural', 'dynamism', 'twins', 'themselves.True', 'French', 'cinema', 'story', 'dynamic', 'morphing', 'casual', 'commentary', 'more', 'intense', 'social', 'observation', 'relationships', 'sexuality', 'fluidity', 'youth', 'movie', 'interesting', 'twist', 'brothers', 'being', 'twins', 'seem', 'have', 'different', 'relationship', 'father', 'One', 'family', 'bakery', 'whilst', 'other', 'exists', 'periphery', 'who', 'escape', 'much', 'thought', 'brothers', 'make', 'hasty', 'unplanned', 'escape', 'purpose', 'simple', 'wish', 'attend', 'mother', 'funeral', 'Spain', 'Ironically', 'know', 'nothing', 'her', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'relationship', 'father', 'Nothing', 'much', 'said', 'family', 'enough', 'made', 'dysfunctional', 'fragmented', 'nature', 'as', 'well', 'impact', 'Perhaps', 'reason', 'brothers', 'find', 'comfort', 'identity', 'other', 'obvious', 'differences', 'need', 'assert', 'one', 'self', 'world.Without', 'much', 'money', 'brothers', 'are', 'forced', 'rely', 'fate', 'turn', 'cruel', 'graceful', 'Sex', 'be', 'functional', 'normative', 'morality', 'expressed', 'American', 'culture', 'be', 'absent', 'intimate', 'interactions', 'one', 'brother', 'feeling', 'more', 'just', 'lustful', 'frivolity', 'when', 'allowing', 'brief', 'intimacy', 'young', 'man', 'poignant', 'expression', 'rebellion', 'curiosity', 'powerful', 'interlude', 'broader', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'opening', 'something', 'never', 'really', 'experienced', 'intimacy', 'affection', 'however', 'overpowered', 'enormous', 'influence', 'brother.This', 'visually', 'powerful', 'movie', 'imagery', 'expression', 'Similarly', 'powerful', 'expression', 'brotherly', 'love', 'often', 'dialogue', 'expressed', 'intention', 'also', 'passionate', 'evolving', 'emotional', 'jarring.Well', 'moment', 'life']",Give Me Your Hand

In ""Donne-moi la main,"" he casts identical twins (Alexandre and Viktor Carril) to play identical twins. The story revolves around twins who are 18, and on their way to their mother's funeral in Spain without their father's knowledge. As they don't have money, they must hitchhike. On the way, they encounter people who bring something to their lives. There is the girl with whom one of them sleeps despite the fact that the other has bonded with her. Then there is the Arab guy with whom one of the twins has an interesting sexual experience. From these encounters we see their common alienation is also what puts the boys at each other's way.
