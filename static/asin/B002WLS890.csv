I think all should watch this doc. as it is so informative and really and eye opener of who really has the control in the US and around the world.  Take some time and watch when you have time to really sit down to listen with out being inturrupted.,5,Must and Eye Opener,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,333,"['do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'many', 'documentries', 'was', 'suprised', 'even', 'chose', 'one', 'watch', 'think', 'should', 'watch', 'doc', 'so', 'informative', 'really', 'eye', 'opener', 'who', 'really', 'control', 'US', 'world', 'Take', 'time', 'watch', 'when', 'have', 'time', 'really', 'sit', 'down', 'listen', 'out', 'being', 'inturrupted']",N/A

This is so boring and amateur.  It's dryly delivered with no emotion.  The story of Oz is lost and clearly only used as a marketing idea.  They did not explain why the movie Oz was written to communicate these ideas but immediately brought me into boring dry facts. The story goes into factual history of unnecessary details.  All the details causes the meaning to be lost in this film.  This guy shouldn't be making film in my opinion.  I don't care what great reviews this has, this guy is amateur and on the level of a college professor who made a film and nothing more.It's hard to cut down something that is responsible and has a much needed message.  This really was poorly delivered on a low budget.  No talent, dryly delivered. I couldn't stand listening or looking at this guy throughout the film.  Don't understand why he thinks he should be delivering the film.  I have no feeling of who or what he's doing in this film. He comes across as a stranger who did not connect with me in the audience.Few people have the attention span for all these UNNECESSARY facts.  Poor film scripting editing.

Money used as the Federal Reserve or World Bank do, abuses the freedom of almost everyone on the planet. Evil lusts and thrives under such control and power. Evil must then act through the censorship of truth.The great and powerful OZ behind the curtain is wealthy beyond measure. The cartels will do anything to keep Amazon customers and indeed the world citizenry in the dark. A collective of angry and informed people, with God's assistance, could topple and imprison them. This movie is such a wake-up call.Soon America will suffer under the Greatest Depression. As documentaries such as this get people involved, evil will use it's power to bring down the financial systems. The single global currency is the first goal with a cashless control-freak system not far behind. History has proven that all empires do harm to the people and the planet. This one should be the worst yet.We may not be able to stop it, but by buying this DVD, you will at least understand the dynamics and dangers of monetary consolidation.
