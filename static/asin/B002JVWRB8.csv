a true fan.But I'm kinda in the middle about Season 7 because it wasnt a terrible season but it wasnt a great one either.I definitly think it's worth the watch but the price of it now it $32.42 and I dont think it's worth the price of $33 dollars....now I caught it one sale for 18.99 I think its worth that price.:)It also took me a while to get through this season but with the other 3-4 days this one a week.I also miss the opening song and hate that they just show the ""one tree hill"".But like people pointed out it wasnt really that much drama in this season it was mostly just fun and games....sure they had the girl that ""claimed"" she slept with Nathan and the mothers passing away.But nothing that really captured your attention to make you be like OH I CANT WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT no.I also felt like they used some of the music just to try to fell the time for about 3-5 minutes....3-5 minutes that could have been used for something better than watching people sing.And alot of people are like apparently people who dont like this season arent true fans....well I AM....seen every episode,own every season,and DVR every episode from Season 8.I also loved the cover of Season 7.....such a awesome cover for a not so awesome season.But yes I dont think it's a terrible season which is why I gave it 4 stars but not the best which is why it lost a star.It kinda sucks that they took off all the people who made the show so great Dan,Deb,Karen,LUCAS,PEYTON.Currently watching Season 8 and I think it's safe to say that the show will never be what it once was.Further as the new characters:Quinn-my favorite NEW characterAlex-too dramatic she was kinda funnyClay-kinda boring didnt really care for himJulian-he was alright not the most interesting characterSo on a scale 1-10 I'd probably give it a 6 but thats my opnion definitly still a great show,still worth the watch,I hope that the rest of Season 8 will be better than Season 7 and it does look like Season 8 is a little better probably right now I'd give Season 8 a 8.My Favorite Seasons(1-the best 7-not that great):1.Season 42.Season 53.Season 64.Season 75.Season 36.Season 27.Season 1-only because not that much awesome drama as the characters are still trying to develop and had some dull episodes...but hey what can you expect from a starter season.Lol sorry for this being so long but just wanted to share my thoughts and opinions.Some of my favorite episodes are:-7x05 ""Your Cheatin Heart""-7x07 ""I and Love and You""(one of the best episodes of the season)-7x14 ""Family Affairs""-7x22 ""Almost Everything I Wish I'd Said the Last Time I saw You""(the best episode of the season also season finale.)The others are good to but these ones really stood out!The weakest episode of the season was 7x01 ""4:30 am"" kinda dull and slow.Final Thoughts:It was good season definitly not the best but definitly not the worst but still good.I think if your a fan of one tree hill pick it up as you'll like not love but like it too.But if your a die hard LUCAS and PEYTON fan well just consider Season 6 your last season you buy cause from the looks of it their not coming back.Thanks you Amazon for letting it arrive on time.I love lucas and peyton but I still found the show pretty good without them.So thanks for reading my review if you have any comments or disagree with me on somethings or just wondering about things feel free to leave comments.Thanks kbye :).",4,Not the Best Season Ever but Not the Worst Either,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,3574,"['so', 'One',
