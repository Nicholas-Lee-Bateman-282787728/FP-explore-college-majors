And he's not even the main character!The Spoilers is set in Alaska 1890s during a gold rush.  Along side Marlene Dietrich and Randolph Scott this film really shines bright with great acting.The War Wagon is a good, old fashion action film with lots of action and Kirk Douglas to boot!Hellfighters is about firefighters and how they handle the job and their lives, trying to balance the two together.  Lots of action, romance and gritty reality.Rooster Cogburn, named after the character John Wayne played in True Grit, brings that character back to match him up with Katharine Hepburn to bring justice to the West.Outside of Rooster Cogburn I have never seen any of this films and it really allowed me to enjoy and come to respect the many skills and sides of John Wayne.
