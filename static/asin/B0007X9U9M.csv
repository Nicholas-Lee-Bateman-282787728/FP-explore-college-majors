Not my favorite Steve-o by any stretch of the means. It's a lot of the same stuff, and a lot of it isn't stunts or anything like that. I can't say no one would want to see it, but straight guys be warned. Balls and all are shown, and a LOT. Some stuff is funny, but most of it is just..... Stuff you wanna skip to the next chapter of the DVD. If you are the biggest Steve-o fan or you are in love with him and wanna see his goods up close, then this is FOR YOU.",3,Steve-o.......

893193,A2UQKQ0TEOFHFT,B0007X9U9M,Purchaser Magoo,"[19, 19]","Okay, first. I am not one of those people on here that goes around reviewing every cd by a band I don't like just to say that they are a bad band, so although I don't really like the Steve-O DVDs that much, I don't sit around writing reviews about how horrible they are (they aren't horrible, but tons of people wrote reviews saying stuff like that.) I am merly writing this review to warn people and help people save some money and not get angry. This is the worst DVD ever, this is worse than The Adventures of Pluto Nash (it could have tied with Pluto Nash as the worst video ever, except you expect a funny video of Steve-O, if it was called ""Random Guys That Wish They Were Steve-O"" you wouldn't expect greatness and it wouldn't seem as bad)THIS VIDEO IS LACKING IN STEVE-O. I think you can't say a DVD is by Steve-O when he doesn't approve it and more than 80% of the footage is of other people that aren't Steve-O.The back of this DVD says 3 in 1.The first video: Decent, some kind of funny footage of Steve-O.The second video: horrible, about 30 seconds of Steve-O, mainly some random guys trying to be funny.The 3rd video: Horrible, doesn't even have 1 second of Steve-O or anyone that has anything to do with Steve-O (friends, people from jackass, etc)As for the bonus disc: I haven't seen it because I got the normal version (not uncensored or unrated or whatever)***ALERT***This DVD wasn't even approved or released by Steve-O...look at the company that releases Steve-O's DVDs (J+N) and then look at the company that released this DVD.",1,If I could give it negative stars I would...No matter how much you like Steve-O you will hate this DVD...,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,1548,"['Okay', 'first', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'people', 'here', 'around', 'reviewing', 'cd', 'band', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'just', 'say', 'are', 'bad', 'band', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'Steve-O', 'DVDs', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'sit', 'around', 'writing', 'reviews', 'how', 'horrible', 'are', 'are', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'tons', 'people', 'wrote', 'reviews', 'saying', 'stuff', 'am', 'merly', 'writing', 'review', 'warn', 'people', 'help', 'people', 'save', 'money', 'not', 'get', 'angry', 'worst', 'DVD', 'ever', 'worse', 'Adventures', 'Pluto', 'Nash', 'could', 'have', 'tied', 'Pluto', 'Nash', 'worst', 'video', 'ever', 'expect', 'funny', 'video', 'Steve-O', 'was', 'called', 'Random', 'Guys', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Steve-O', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'greatness', 'would', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bad', 'THIS', 'VIDEO', 'IS', 'LACKING', 'IN', 'STEVE-O', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'DVD', 'Steve-O', 'when', ""n't"", 'approve', 'more', '80', '%', 'footage', 'other', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'Steve-O.The', 'back', 'DVD', '3', '1.The', 'first', 'video', 'Decent', 'kind', 'funny', 'footage', 'Steve-O.The', 'second', 'video', 'horrible', 'about', '30', 'seconds', 'Steve-O', 'mainly', 'random', 'guys', 'trying', 'be', 'funny.The', '3rd', 'video', 'Horrible', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', '1', 'second', 'Steve-O', 'anyone', 'anything', 'do', 'Steve-O', 'friends', 'people', 'jackass', 'etc', 'bonus', 'disc', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'got', 'normal', 'version', 'not', 'uncensored', 'unrated', '***ALERT***This', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'approved', 'released', 'Steve-O', 'look', 'company', 'Steve-O', 'DVDs', 'J+N', 'then', 'look', 'company', 'released', 'DVD']",Steve-O: Gross Misconduct - Uncensored
