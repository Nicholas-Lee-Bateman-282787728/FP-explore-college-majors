Featured on it are stop-motion animated versions ofCurious GeorgeandCurious George Goes to the Hospitalwhich follows those two books scene for scene. The production of the Curious George animation on this DVD was overseen by Curious George original author/creator Margret Rey. It also has several other animated shorts of classic books including Frog and Toad, which my daughter also really likes.My family likes this, and the new PBS TV seriesCurious George: Monkey Collection, Vol. 1, WAY better than the 2006 movieCurious George (Widescreen Edition).",5,"Better than the new movie, and true to the books.

949476,A3UV7L5ND3EH8T,B000BT994I,"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C...","[143, 143]","Ever since my son saw Curious George at the theater, he's been into the whole George scene. He has a stuffed George, the PS2 game, several books (one based on the movie and two from H.A. Rey), etc.When he saw this DVD at the store, he wanted it (of course). It was very affordable, so I bought it for him.I was VERY surprised to find out that, despite the illustrations on the box, it is NOT an animated film or collection of animated stories. It's not even stills of the Rey books with voice actors reading the story.No, what this Collector's Edition DVD is made up of is two Curious George stories done in stop motion with puppets. Although it's unusual to see at first, it has TOTALLY entranced my son. He watches it a least once a day...and this has been going on since before Easter.However, there are only two actual Curious George stories on this DVD: Curious George Comes to America and Curious George Goes to the Hospital. The first story, created circa early 1980's, is about the Man in the Yellow Hat and his initial meeting with George...including his decision to bring George to the city. George's shipboard antics gets him in BIG trouble!The second story has George going to the hospital when he swallows a puzzle piece. He's rushed to the emergency room (which is a rather odd storyline for young kids), but ends up forgetting his fears...instead cheering up other people.The rest of the DVD includes four stop animation/claymation stories (NOT featuring George):*Frog and Toad Together*Frog and Toad Are Friends*Mouse Soup*Morris Has a ColdThere's also a ""making of"" at the end.One of the episodes is absolutely hilarious. It features two rocks bemoaning how they don't have eyes and such. They break out in song ""We don't have belly buttons..."" and as they mention various body parts, the parts magically appear. It's clever and very funny...my husband and I make sure we're in front of the TV every time it's on! (You gotta see it to appreciate it, believe me...)So if you're looking for 100% Curious George, you may be disappointed. But at this affordable price--and considering the length (almost 2 hours)--I think it's a good buy for something different for the youngsters.",5,Unusual...But My Son Loves It,1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,2194,"['Ever', 'son', 'saw', 'Curious', 'George', 'theater', 'been', 'whole', 'George', 'scene', 'stuffed', 'George', 'PS2', 'game', 'several', 'books', 'one', 'based', 'movie', 'two', 'H.A', 'Rey', 'saw', 'DVD', 'store', 'wanted', 'course', 'was', 'very', 'affordable', 'bought', 'him.I', 'was', 'VERY', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'illustrations', 'box', 'NOT', 'animated', 'film', 'collection', 'animated', 'stories', 'not', 'even', 'stills', 'Rey', 'books', 'voice', 'actors', 'reading', 'story.No', 'what', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'made', 'two', 'Curious', 'George', 'stories', 'done', 'stop', 'motion', 'puppets', 'unusual', 'see', 'first', 'TOTALLY', 'entranced', 'son', 'least', 'once', 'day', 'been', 'going', 'Easter.However', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'actual', 'Curious', 'George', 'stories', 'DVD', 'Curious', 'George', 'Comes', 'America', 'Curious', 'George', 'Goes', 'Hospital', 'first', 'story', 'created', 'circa', 'early', '1980', 'Man', 'Yellow', 'Hat', 'initial', 'meeting', 'George', 'including', 'decision', 'bring', 'George', 'city', 'George', 'shipboard', 'antics', 'BIG', 'trouble', 'second', 'story', 'George', 'going', 'hospital', 'when', 'puzzle', 'piece', 'rushed', 'emergency', 'room', 'rather', 'odd', 'storyline', 'young', 'kids', 'up', 'forgetting', 'fears', 'instead', 'cheering', 'up', 'other', 'people.The', 'rest', 'DVD', 'four', 'stop', 'animation/claymation', 'stories', 'NOT', 'featuring', 'George', '*Frog', 'Toad', 'Together*Frog', 'Toad', 'Are', 'Friends*Mouse', 'Soup*Morris', 'ColdThere', 'also', 'making', 'end.One', 'episodes', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'two', 'rocks', 'bemoaning', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'eyes', 'such', 'break', 'out', 'song', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'belly', 'buttons', 'mention', 'various', 'body', 'parts', 'parts', 'magically', 'appear', 'clever', 'very', 'funny', 'husband', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'front', 'TV', 'time', 'got', 'ta', 'see', 'appreciate', 'believe', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', '100', '%', 'Curious', 'George', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'affordable', 'price', 'considering', 'length', 'almost', '2', 'hours', 'think', 'good', 'buy', 'something', 'different', 'youngsters']",Curious George

949479,A2J005B7R0MCTK,B000BT994I,"Ray's Movie Reviews ""Ray""","[0, 0]","While being an adult, I have never really been a huge fan of Curious George, except I find as I see it more and more that it is rather funny, except I think that ""The Man in The Yellow"" hat would be in trouble for child neglect these days....  Oh that's right it's a monkey.  Maybe theSPCA might have something to say then.....  I don't really know but theyare quite entertaining, forget the irresponsible Yellow hat guy and enjoyCurious George's constant curiosity.What is even better about this DVD though is the other video's on it.My daughter is Autistic and though she's an adult she still likes to lookat stuff from her younger years, and we saw this one that we hadn't seenin years, ""The Adventures of Frog And Toad"" by Arnold Lobel.  They areclaymation and are really excellent.If you are the type who cannot sit still long and need to get up and beon the move, you will identify with Frog.  If you are the procrastinatortype, who really doesn't see the need for adventure, and would rather sithome eating cookies or sleeping, then you will identify with Toad.  Andlike we all are, we often have best friends who are the opposite of us,and that is what makes life interesting.There are one or two other series on this also, that I wasn't as familiarwith, but they are also good and highly recommended.A very good value for the money!",5,Classic Curious George and so much more,1256083200,"10 21, 2009",2009,1341,"['being', 'adult', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Curious', 'George', 'find', 'see', 'more', 'more', 'rather', 'funny', 'think', 'Man', 'Yellow', 'would', 'be', 'trouble', 'child', 'neglect', 'days', 'Oh', 'right', 'monkey', 'Maybe', 'theSPCA', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'then', '..', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'theyare', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'forget', 'irresponsible', 'Yellow', 'hat', 'guy', 'enjoyCurious', 'George', 'constant', 'curiosity.What', 'even', 'better', 'DVD', 'though', 'other', 'video', 'it.My', 'daughter', 'Autistic', 'adult', 'still', 'lookat', 'stuff', 'younger', 'years', 'saw', 'one', 'had', ""n't"", 'seenin', 'years', 'Adventures', 'Frog', 'Toad', 'Arnold', 'Lobel', 'areclaymation', 'are', 'really', 'are', 'type', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'sit', 'still', 'long', 'need', 'get', 'up', 'beon', 'move', 'will', 'identify', 'Frog', 'are', 'procrastinatortype', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'see', 'need', 'adventure', 'would', 'rather', 'sithome', 'eating', 'cookies', 'sleeping', 'then', 'will', 'identify', 'Toad', 'are', 'often', 'have', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'opposite', 'what', 'life', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'series', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiarwith', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'highly', 'recommended.A', 'very', 'good', 'value', 'money']",Curious George
