I think there are some original scenes in this one and that is what makes this one unique. Still, there is a reason it was lost.

Mid-80's slasher begins very badly, with tons of elaborate pranks that aren't all that amusing, but the movie does get on the right foot by the half-hour mark, once the characters are stuck in the school while the nerd picks them apart.  Unfortunately, the last fifteen minutes fall apart, thanks to an incredibly long and redundant chase back and forth throughout the entire school (which doesn't appear very large once we see this chase) and a twist ending that's jaw-droppingly inane.  Of special note, Harry Manfredini's score is a pain to listen to when he's not emulating his work from Friday the 13th and Caroline Munro (at the time) was a 36-year old actress playing a teen!  Plus, you can clearly hear the actors trying to hide their British accents!

I thought it was nothing more then a funny horror comedy but I was wrong and i'm so glad I did. This film centers around a nerd who is bullied and ends up burning himself. We flash foward to years later and the class reunion is coming up. The school is now abandoned and they have a party at the school and it seems Marty sets up there old lockers in a room and stuff the havent seen in years. The movie really takes off from there and the pace is pretty good and the kills are very well done. The ending came out of nowhere and i'm surprised they never made a sequel. It's a satisfying movie and i'm glad I purchased this dvd.If you like horror movies from the 80's, then check this out. While people complain about the transfer, I found nothing wrong with it.

Certainly the death scenes are creative, and a few of them are quite original. I love the atmosphere of the film and its low-budget looks, and it truly fits the horror films of 80's, given the amount of money the producers had to work with. It is just awesome. Granted the acting isn't top-notch, and the characters are quite annoying. However, it's fun and gratifying when they take the And Then There Were None route. Of course, the film is somewhat similar to April Fool's Day, but I did enjoy Slaughter High nonetheless. Surely, there are some dumb moments in the film. What a typical 80's slasher film doesn't? For example in Slaughter High, when the lives of characters are suddenly in danger of being murdered, a couple will have sex, another will fix a tractor and attempts to rams down a wall with it, and others will fall asleep, waiting. One said that the killings will stop at noon of the next day as it is April Fool's Day. Sure...right...but I don't think that the rule is set in stone nor anyone actually follows it. The way the characters talk in Slaughter High is hideous. Yet it is a good thing they got killed off in the film, yes? Or no? All in all, Slaughter High is a worthwhile picture to watch in the middle of the night. Of course, the film comes with a moral lesson when it comes to bullying. Take heed of it. An interesting note about Simon Scuddamore, who played the slasher Marty Ratzen, he killed himself shortly after the completion of the picture by drug overdose.

The movie begins with B movie fave Caroline Munro leading school dweeb Marty (Simon Scuddamore) into the girls locker room. Marty thinks he is finally about to lose his virginity, but he is soon ambushed by a group of slags and jocks who dump the poor naked DWEEB's head into the toilet and flush it on him. This lands the slags and jocks in trouble so to get revenge on Marty they give him a MARIJUANA cigarette which is more toxic than usual. Unfortunately dweeb boy makes the mistake of smoking it while performing one of his experiments in the science lab, predictably it blows up and Marty is hideously burned beyond recogniton, and grabs at Caroline Munro as he is being wheeled out. She wakes with a start. She's been having a nightmarish flashback from 15 years ago. (A brillant twist by director George Dugdale. PS: I'm being sarcastic).Pretty soon Munro receives a phonecall in which her former high school friends are holding a reunion at the old abandoned school. But Marty is waiting for them. In fact, he's quite literally there with bells on....SLAUGHTER HIGH isn't the worst slasher movie ever made but its still far from being special. The death scenes are lousy: one hanging with the victim's feet kicking and thrashing about, a flat chested girl being fried alive in an acid bath. Pretty boring stuff.

230939,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6300263487,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","Slaughter High has everything you're looking for in a comically bad horror film: a horrible script, a veritable plague of bad acting, terrible cinematography (it's not uncommon for the screen to go completely black for 15-20 seconds at a time), some enjoyable and even halfway creative killings, a little gratuitous nudity (although very little, in the case of this film), and of course a patented ""they should have ended the movie five minutes sooner"" ending.  Slaughter High is also quite informative.  Did you know, for example, that April Fool's Day ends at noon?Let's begin at the beginning.  Marty Rantzen (Simon Scuddamore) is a nerd; there can be no doubt about that.  I was a nerd in high school too, but Marty is in a league of his own.  He actually believes class babe Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) when she leads him into the girls' locker room and tells him she wants to - well, you know.  The poor dope.  It's just a setup, of course, resulting in one of the most embarrassing moments imaginable.  Unfortunately, that's just the warm-up act for Marty on this particular day.  The pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance leaves him physically and mentally scarred for life.  A few years later, all of Marty's tormentors return to the school for a high school reunion.  Despite the fact that no other classmates show up at the old, abandoned school house, this gang of friends waits outside all day before finally breaking into the building to reminisce, drink, smoke weed, and sniff lines.  Like roaches in a roach motel, they check in but they don't check out.  For reasons I certainly cannot explain, they find themselves trapped inside the building - and with a homicidal maniac, at that.  One by one, they all meet grisly ends as Marty exacts his revenge for what they did to him.  A couple of the killings, as I've mentioned, are actually rather impressive - especially given the film's obviously low budget.  They are not overly graphic, though, so you don't have to worry about turning away if you're squeamish - and you certainly don't have to worry about feeling any remorse for the victims because they are all as unlikeable as they are shallow.  I was rooting Marty on all the way.Why these dolts don't find one of the school's many windows and break the glass to escape is just one of many oddities in the story.  Why, for example, is a custodian still taking care of the place several years after it was abandoned - and why would he be roaming the halls so late on the night in question?  Why does the building still have power and water?  Why is there a bathtub in the ladies' locker room?  Then there's the whole April Fool's Day ends at noon thing.  These people actually convince themselves, with no debate whatsoever, that they'll be safe if they can just hold out until noon the next day.  This whole noon rule certainly wasn't in effect the day they ruined Marty's life back in high school, as all of those pranks took place after the school day was over.

Most of the plot does not make sense.  Many of the events are not accurately continuous:Why is there still a janitor/caretaker in a closed-down school?  Why do the victims insist that leaving a building where a killer lingers is a death wish?  Why is there a bed in the school?  Why is there a bathtub in the school?  How did the victims know the killer was Marty before having seen any evidence or his face?  None of those things, plus many more, do not happen.The actors cannot act.  Nobody's lines are convincing enough to make this into a quality movie.  However, the one positive aspect of the movie is that their special effects show some talented effort.

230944,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6300263487,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[1, 6]","In an era that produced a lot of slasher flicks, the 80s also unfortunately produced some really bad ones, and ""Slaugher High"" is definitely one of the really bad ones.In ""Slaughter High"", Marty is the school nerd, and he does a very good job of being just that.  He dresses like one, acts likes one so let's call a spade a spade here right off the bat.  Indeed, everyone picks on Marty at high school.  After all, this is typical teenaged society.  As the school nerd, Marty seems to be just trying to fit in but can't seem to catch a break.  With clear parallels to ""Carrie"", ""Slaughter High"" clumsily addresses the brutal social clicks that are only too characteristic of teenaged life.  Of course, let's not give this movie too much credit because it does not take itself seriously and is, in fact, just a total joke, and this is clear from the outset of the movie.  However, when Marty is nearly burnt to death (plagiarism of ""The Burning"" maybe?) in a prank that goes horribly wrong, the movie attempts to move towards a horror film like setting, at least, that is what the creators of this movie would like you to think, but sophisticated horror movie fans will not be able to make this transition in this joke of a movie, at least not honestly.At any rate, ""Slaughter High"" fast forwards a few years later to a high school reunion at the old school where ""the burning"" incident took place.  All of the culprits who were responsible for burning Marty are present, but where is Marty?  Indeed, this is your typical high school and teenaged revenge of the nerd flick somewhat like ""976-Evil"" only this one is a bit better, but that's not saying much.The acting is pretty bad even for this type of flick, and the movie comes across as completely boring, formulaic and lacking in style as well as substance.  The movie does use some of the ""Friday the 13th"" style music to attempt to set a tone and atmosphere to this flick, but it really doesn't work because no serious horror movie fan can take this movie seriously.  There is no mystery or suspense in ""Slaughter High"".  There are NO likeable characters in ""Slaughter High"", and the acting comes across so wooden that the audience really can't get into this generic slasher at all. Perhaps, most importantly, Marty is not a good horror movie villain, and the effect is devastating on the movie in that Marty's character and prowess (or lack thereof) as a horror movie villain cannot be taken seriously.  Finally, there's no mystery in Marty's character at all even with the jester mask on, and there is no twist a la ""Happy Birthday To Me"" which is so common with these slasher flicks (although the ending tries to be one of those blow your mind conclusions, but it doesn't work).  Marty just comes off as Louis Scullnick on ""Revenge of the Nerds"" with a knife.  I mean what an obnoxious little geek he is even after all the killing that he does.  Also, I love how this little nerd dawns the strength of Michael Myers after his little accident as well...that's very common for slasher movies and sometimes it works, but not with Marty...he is the quintessential joke of a horror movie villain.  Not exactly the source for a scary slasher flick.In short, ""Slaughter High"" has no style, no substance and no ability to elicit any scares in the audience.  Therefore, the movie comes off as a total joke.  Basically, ""Slaughter High"" is just another revenge of the nerd type of movie in the mold of a ""plain jane"" slasher flick which just doesn't do enough to hold the serious horror movie fan's interest.  I would even recommend ""Valentine"" starring Denise Richards over this movie.  ""Carrie"" is a better flick regarding the cruelty of teenaged society, although ""Carrie"" is certainly no slasher flick and is more than just a horror movie.  There are a lot of slasher flicks that clearly surpass ""Slaughter High"" like: ""Madman"", ""Happy Birthday to Me"", ""The Burning"", ""Slumber Party Massacre"", ""My Bloody Valentine"", ""Hell Night"", and ""He Knows You're Alone"" just to name a few, but this list can go on and on because ""Slaughter High"" is so terrible.After watching ""Slaughter High"", all one can do is just roll one's eyes in utter disgust at this very poor attempt to create a slasher-horror movie.",1,"0 STARS: Revenge of the Nerd, slasher-style!",1190246400,"09 20, 2007",2007,4250,"['era', 'produced', 'lot', 'slasher', 'flicks', '80s', 'also', 'unfortunately', 'produced', 'really', 'bad', 'ones', 'Slaugher', 'High', 'definitely', 'one', 'really', 'bad', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'Marty', 'school', 'nerd', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'just', 'one', 'likes', 'one', 'so', 'let', 'call', 'spade', 'spade', 'here', 'right', 'bat', 'Indeed', 'everyone', 'picks', 'Marty', 'high', 'school', 'typical', 'teenaged', 'society', 'school', 'nerd', 'Marty', 'be', 'just', 'trying', 'fit', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'break', 'clear', 'parallels', 'Carrie', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'clumsily', 'brutal', 'social', 'clicks', 'are', 'only', 'too', 'characteristic', 'teenaged', 'life', 'course', 'let', 'not', 'give', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'credit', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'fact', 'just', 'total', 'joke', 'clear', 'outset', 'movie', 'However', 'when', 'Marty', 'nearly', 'burnt', 'death', 'plagiarism', 'Burning', 'maybe', 'prank', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'movie', 'move', 'towards', 'horror', 'film', 'setting', 'least', 'what', 'creators', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'sophisticated', 'horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'transition', 'joke', 'movie', 'least', 'not', 'honestly.At', 'rate', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'fast', 'forwards', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'old', 'school', 'where', 'burning', 'incident', 'took', 'place', 'culprits', 'who', 'were', 'responsible', 'burning', 'Marty', 'are', 'present', 'where', 'Marty', 'Indeed', 'typical', 'high', 'school', 'teenaged', 'revenge', 'nerd', 'flick', 'somewhat', '976-Evil', 'only', 'one', 'bit', 'better', 'not', 'saying', 'much.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bad', 'even', 'type', 'flick', 'movie', 'completely', 'boring', 'formulaic', 'lacking', 'style', 'as', 'well', 'substance', 'movie', 'use', 'Friday', '13th', 'style', 'music', 'attempt', 'set', 'tone', 'atmosphere', 'flick', 'really', ""n't"", 'work', 'because', 'serious', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'can', 'take', 'movie', 'seriously', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'are', 'NO', 'likeable', 'characters', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'acting', 'so', 'wooden', 'audience', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'generic', 'slasher', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'Marty', 'not', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'villain', 'effect', 'devastating', 'movie', 'Marty', 'character', 'prowess', 'lack', 'thereof', 'horror', 'movie', 'villain', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Finally', 'mystery', 'Marty', 'character', 'even', 'jester', 'mask', 'twist', 'la', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'Me', 'so', 'common', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'ending', 'tries', 'be', 'one', 'mind', 'conclusions', ""n't"", 'work', 'Marty', 'just', 'off', 'Louis', 'Scullnick', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'knife', 'mean', 'what', 'obnoxious', 'little', 'geek', 'even', 'killing', 'Also', 'love', 'how', 'little', 'nerd', 'dawns', 'strength', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'little', 'accident', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'common', 'slasher', 'movies', 'not', 'Marty', 'quintessential', 'joke', 'horror', 'movie', 'villain', 'Not', 'exactly', 'source', 'scary', 'slasher', 'flick.In', 'short', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'style', 'substance', 'ability', 'elicit', 'scares', 'audience', 'Therefore', 'movie', 'off', 'total', 'joke', 'Basically', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'just', 'revenge', 'nerd', 'type', 'movie', 'mold', 'plain', 'jane', 'flick', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'enough', 'hold', 'serious', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'interest', 'would', 'even', 'recommend', 'Valentine', 'starring', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'movie', 'Carrie', 'better', 'flick', 'regarding', 'cruelty', 'teenaged', 'society', 'Carrie', 'certainly', 'no', 'slasher', 'flick', 'more', 'just', 'horror', 'movie', 'are', 'lot', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'clearly', 'surpass', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'Madman', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'Me', 'Burning', 'Slumber', 'Party', 'Massacre', 'Bloody', 'Valentine', 'Hell', 'Night', ""'re"", 'Alone', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'list', 'can', 'go', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'so', 'terrible.After', 'watching', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'just', 'roll', 'one', 'eyes', 'utter', 'disgust', 'very', 'poor', 'attempt', 'create', 'slasher-horror', 'movie']",N/A

230946,A1FGG93X6HT374,6300263487,James O'Blivion,"[1, 6]","Did someone say this movie was worth 80 bucks???? Well, having seen it once, I found it for sale for $3.00 at my local video store. I promptly called my girlfriend over to the Previously-Viewed rack and say ""Hey, look...I found the WORST slasher movie ever made! I'm gonna buy it!!!"" And honestly...3 bucks was kinda high to go for this title...and I only bought it for kicks. This film is truly not fit for human consumption. I can understand that sometimes, a director can make a bad movie. But to think that it took THREE directors to craft this piece of cinematic excrement is astounding. Let us examine this film a bit more closely, so that you can see what I mean without actually having to subject yourself to the living hell that is watching ""Slaughter High.""First of all, this film was shot in Britain, using British actors. Nothing wrong with that...until they try to convince you that they're Americans, living in America. Ah, yes...there's the quandry. The American accents are hilariously cliched. Despite the fact that these characters grew up together, you've got over-the-top New York accents mixed with over-the-top Southern accents, etc. And the actors slip out of these laughable accents seemingly whenever they feel the urge...reverting to their natural, very British, states.Next, there's the music. There are three or four basic pieces of music which appear throughout this entire film...and they are ALL bloody awful. None of them are scary in the least, and most often, they're simply annoying and intrusive. Some of it sounds like music that should accompany a knight riding through a forest...and some of it sounds like it may have been culled from old ""Leave it to Beaver"" episodes. And those are the two most TOLERABLE pieces.Then there's the dialogue. Okay. When a character tosses her keys to another character and says ""She always starts the first time,"" it's pretty obvious what's going to happen, isn't it? No one says those things in real life, do they? And this isn't even the worst piece of dialogue in the film...it's just a personal favorite of mine.Then there's plausibilty. No matter HOW stupid these characters are supposed to be, there is NO WAY they would do some of the things they do after they find out that they're being murdered one by one. Also, I don't know about you, but MY high school did NOT have a bath tub. Etc. Etc. Etc.The production values are also particularly bad. In one outdoor sequence, it's so dark that what you're essentially looking at is a black screen with a bit of barely discernable movement on it. It's difficult-to-impossible to get even a vague IDEA of what's happening. Fortunately for the directors, this poses little problem....because by that point in the movie, you really don't CARE what's happening. In fact, by this point in the movie, you've probably already taken it out of your VCR and decided to watch ""The Lost Boys"" for the 4,000th time...and wisely so.Also, the attempts to scare the audience through ""psyche-outs"" on several occasions throughout the movie fail on every level. Similar techniques are a time-honored tradition in slasher movies, and have been used effectively in a myriad of ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" films. Usually, at least ONE such attempt will prove fruitful and actually make you jump. Alas...such is not the case here. Here, you're more likely to sit back and say ""God, that was stupid.""Finally (FINALLY!!), there's the ending. I won't spoil it for you, just in case you're actually masochistic enough to want to SEE this movie. I'll just say that the ending is just as bad as, if not worse than, the rest of the film.The only thing of interest here is the level of gore...particularly if you watch the unrated version. Some slasher fans may want to see this for the chance to look at ""human intestines,"" but I can't imagine any real slasher movie aficionado taking this movie seriously for more than fifteen seconds.The bottom line is that this movie is just BAD. And not even bad in a fun way. More like bad in an excruciating ""Dear GOD, why won't it END?!?!"" kind of way. My advice is to see ""Terror Train"" instead.

This one always stuck out in my mind. I loved it so much because it didn't really take it self so seriously. Sure, the acting is stilted, and their accents make them sound like deaf people learning to speak! The movie's about a nerd in high school who gets pranked by the popular kids and the prank turns deadly. Or so they think. Turns out that the nerd is alive and ready for revenge (years later, though!). My favorite part of the movie is when the popular kids are reuniting at the abandoned school, and this big motorcycling oaf  from the gang comes roaring in on his bike and falls off (even though he clearly is safely  getting off the bike and lands on the grass), and the camera closes in on him as he says ""Oh, man, that-bike-has-got-to-go"". And he says it so slowly and pauses after each word. I used to tell my friends about that scene, and they never believed me that the actor said it that way. But once they saw it, they knew my impression was dead on. All the actors smoke a cigarette in the movie, and  smoke them like they're supposed to be smoking pot, which is wierd. Was it supposed to be pot? I don't know.  All of the deaths in this movie are hilarious, one funnier after the other. I wont tell you about them because they are to funny for me to spoil them for you. And make sure to keep an eye out for the stereotypical black janitor.  Also look out for the great soundtrack of one intsrumental tune over and over, and a rock song with some crazy singer saying,""April Fools, HA HA HA HA""!!!

And I do mean BAD.Anyone who has read my review list knows I recently gave high praise to the 1992 film Bram Stoker's Dracula and here I will make a confession that I used to be a HUGE Freddy Krueger fan. I say this to make the point that I am not afraid of watching a slasher flick on occasion. That being said, here's my warning. Folks, avoid this like the BLACK DEATH PLAGUE. It's the typical ""nerd gets even with high-school in crowd"" junk-fest. I couldn't care less who or which of the charactes survived this piece of garbage.I can't rememeber too much about this. The deaths were way too over-the-top and so badly done that they looked comical instead of scary. No memorable diaglogue at all, and these people could not ACT, even given the low-grade waste of a script they were given to work with. Oh, and the villian gets no ""just desserts"" as it were. He just goes on his merry way at the climax. *SIGH* Seriously folks I am not normally THIS harsh on a film, even on low-grade stuff, but this thing was just plain awful, with absolutely no redeeming qualities at all, even for a slasher flick it blew royal chunks. If you happen to see this, take it home, throw it on the floor, stomp on it, burn it and throw the ashes in the trash.

230952,A236PDCSYIOQBU,6300263487,"K. Cope ""Kcope""","[0, 0]","I am a big fan of horror movies. I am gradually increasing my collection, and this is movie is the latest addition. I read some reviews for this film on Amazon and everyone seemed to be raving about it. So, needless to say once I got it, I couldn't wait to watch it. Once I did I, ehh.......It's not bad for a horror movie. It is made a little more cheaply then some of the other horror movies I've seen. The quality of a horror movie for me is one of the most important elements I look for. If the camera work is bad, and the acting is bad, then I don't enjoy it as much. In Slaughter High, or (SH), the acting is middle of the road, and the camera work is pretty poor at some points. Some movies that are cheaply made, look great because of great directing. This movie looks like it was made with a hand held home movie camera at some points.The next thing I look for is the death scenes. Are they believeable, and are they cool? SH has some really creative death sequences, but after they happen, most of the time I said what the heck? The poisoned beer was a little unbelieveable, but the bath scene took the cake. If I'm in a tub, and the water suddenly starts changing to boiling red blood, I'm out of there. The girl just stays in there for a good minute until her skin melts off, huh....... Then you see another shot of her and it's just her skeleton. Now I'm no doctor, but I've boiled a chicken a time or two. That water, or excuse me, blood, must have been pretty darn hot to melt her skin off in about two minutes. Plus the claymation was a little unnessecary.The last thing I look for is the ending. It has to be good because we've spent an hour and twenty minutes watching it. Some horror movies spend so much time on the killing and effects, when it comes to the ending they throw something together. Case in point, Nightmare on Elm Street I. After that movie was over I said...wait...what???... it's over????However, SH ends pretty well. Marty is revealed as the killer, but that's no surprise because they tell you 20 minutes into the movie. I think the ending they gave is, well alright but incredibly overdone in other movies, not to mention shows like Dallas (ha).I think it would have been much cooler to have the gym teacher as the killer, instead of Marty. He seemed to stick up for Marty, and I don't think anyone would have expected that, which would have made a much more shocking ending. In horror movies it's all about misdirection. People are always expecting the unexpected, but that would have been the best ending since Sleepaway Camp.Overall it wasn't the worst horror movie I've ever seen. It was far from the best though. If you can find it for 2.99 or are able to rent it, get it. Otherwise I wouldn't waste my time.",3,SLAUGHTER HIGH - huh..........,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,2752,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'horror', 'movies', 'am', 'gradually', 'increasing', 'collection', 'movie', 'latest', 'addition', 'read', 'reviews', 'film', 'Amazon', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'be', 'raving', 'So', 'needless', 'say', 'once', 'got', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'Once', 'did', 'ehh', '.It', 'not', 'bad', 'horror', 'movie', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'cheaply', 'then', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quality', 'horror', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'elements', 'look', 'camera', 'work', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'SH', 'acting', 'middle', 'road', 'camera', 'work', 'pretty', 'poor', 'points', 'movies', 'are', 'cheaply', 'made', 'look', 'great', 'great', 'directing', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'hand', 'held', 'home', 'movie', 'camera', 'points.The', 'next', 'thing', 'look', 'death', 'scenes', 'Are', 'believeable', 'are', 'cool', 'SH', 'really', 'creative', 'death', 'sequences', 'happen', 'most', 'time', 'said', 'what', 'heck', 'poisoned', 'beer', 'was', 'little', 'unbelieveable', 'bath', 'scene', 'took', 'cake', ""'m"", 'tub', 'water', 'suddenly', 'changing', 'boiling', 'red', 'blood', ""'m"", 'girl', 'just', 'good', 'minute', 'skin', 'melts', 'off', 'huh', 'Then', 'see', 'shot', 'just', 'skeleton', 'Now', ""'m"", 'doctor', ""'ve"", 'boiled', 'chicken', 'time', 'two', 'water', 'excuse', 'blood', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'darn', 'hot', 'melt', 'skin', 'two', 'minutes', 'claymation', 'was', 'little', 'unnessecary.The', 'last', 'thing', 'look', 'ending', 'be', 'good', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'watching', 'horror', 'movies', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'killing', 'effects', 'when', 'ending', 'throw', 'something', 'together', 'Case', 'point', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'movie', 'was', 'said', 'wait', 'what', 'However', 'SH', 'pretty', 'well', 'Marty', 'revealed', 'killer', 'surprise', 'tell', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'think', 'ending', 'gave', 'well', 'alright', 'incredibly', 'overdone', 'other', 'movies', 'not', 'mention', 'shows', 'Dallas', 'ha', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'cooler', 'have', 'gym', 'teacher', 'killer', 'instead', 'Marty', 'seemed', 'stick', 'up', 'Marty', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'shocking', 'ending', 'horror', 'movies', 'misdirection', 'People', 'are', 'always', 'expecting', 'unexpected', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'ending', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp.Overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'worst', 'horror', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'though', 'can', 'find', '2.99', 'are', 'able', 'rent', 'get', 'would', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time']",N/A

McParland,"[1, 1]","First off if you're coming into this movie looking for or thinking you'll get great cinema you're not the brightest bulb and you've come to the wrong place. This is just another really fun 80's slasher film. This one has been sort of lost in the sands of time. I only just heard of it around Halloween 2012. Very similar to so many of the films that were churned out at the time but so much more fun than most of them. No it's not scary, the jokes are lame, but it's a bygone era that was fun and enjoyable.

Let it be known that there is hardly anything scary to be found in Slaughter High, and the film definitely shows just how low budget the whole affair is, but it has a goofy horror quality to it, doesn't take itself seriously in the least, and is just purposely bad.  The story revolves around tormented high school nerd Marty (Simon Scuddamore, who commited suicide shortly after the film was released), who gets horribly disfigured by a gang of cool kids (including hottie genre stalwart Caroline Munro) during a prank gone awry, and returns years later to wreak havoc upon them during a high school reunion.  While Slaughter High follows mostly typical slasher conventions, it offers enough graphic, gross-out deaths that are actually inventive, and an ending that seals the deal that nothing here is to be taken seriously.  Despite it's shortcomings, Slaughter High somehow manages to be enjoyable, and now that it's finally on DVD in all it's uncut glory, we can all enjoy Marty's revenge again and again.",4,Underrated and overlooked,1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,1261,"['80', 'were', 'responsible', 'never', 'ending', 'stream', 'terrible', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'other', 'big', 'name', 'franchises', 'Friday', '13th', 'Halloween', 'was', 'one', 'particular', 'always', 'stood', 'out', 'friends', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'Let', 'be', 'known', 'hardly', 'anything', 'scary', 'be', 'found', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'film', 'definitely', 'just', 'how', 'low', 'budget', 'whole', 'affair', 'goofy', 'horror', 'quality', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'least', 'just', 'purposely', 'bad', 'story', 'around', 'tormented', 'high', 'school', 'nerd', 'Marty', 'Simon', 'Scuddamore', 'who', 'commited', 'suicide', 'shortly', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'who', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'gang', 'cool', 'kids', 'including', 'hottie', 'genre', 'stalwart', 'Caroline', 'Munro', 'prank', 'gone', 'awry', 'returns', 'years', 'later', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'mostly', 'typical', 'slasher', 'conventions', 'enough', 'graphic', 'gross-out', 'deaths', 'are', 'actually', 'inventive', 'ending', 'deal', 'nothing', 'here', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'shortcomings', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'somehow', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'now', 'finally', 'DVD', 'uncut', 'glory', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Marty', 'revenge', 'again', 'again']",N/A

Slaughter High was originally a part of the wave of holiday-themed slasher flicks, but Danilo Bach and Fred Walton had the same idea the same year, and so April Fool's Day became Slaughter High. Which is probably a good thing, because Bach and Walton's movie does it ever so much better. This is a pile of junk, though it ended up being a surprisingly influential one.Marty Rantzen (Simon Scuddamore in his only screen appearance; he overdoed fatally soon after the movie's release) is the school nerd, and as such an obvious target for the jocks. One April Fool's Day they're particularly nasty, and as a result, an accident in the chemistry lab almost kills him. Fast-forward to ten years later, and the eight kids who were involved are all coming back for their tenth high school reunion. When they get there, however, they find the school has been closed down for five years and is scheduled for demolition the last month--and that they are the only eight who were invited. No, that's not an obvious setup or anything, so they all decide to start drinking the provided alcohol, smoking grass, and being generally stupid when there's, you know, a slasher bent on revenge against the kids who destroyed his life years before.It's entirely unexceptional, and if you're the kind of person who picks apart slasher movies, you're going to find a whole lot of stupid here to pick apart. The script is horrendous, the acting is worse (lead actresses Caroline Munro and Donna Yeager often sound confused they're not in a Shakespearean production, and lapse into that theatrical enunciation with fake British accents), the camerawork is dismal. And while it may not seem like it if you're seeing this for the first time almost twenty-five years after it was released, what really set this apart form the pack was the gore effects. Back in the eighties, gore was either done with smoke, mirrors, and suggestion (witness most American slasher flicks in the seventies and eighties) or was overplayed for camp, laughs, or to make the MPAA realize it wasn't meant to look realistic (think the original Dawn of the Dead or the films of Lucio Fulci). Slaughter High was, as far as I know, the first time gore effects were played straight, and with a few exceptions as realistic as possible given the budget on which the movie was obviously made. (I don't think there's any horror director in the world who can resist the temptation to go over the top once in a while.) So if you're a fan of horror movies, it is worth watching for that reason. Still, don't expect much. It really is awful. **",2,Stupid high.,1252972800,"09 15, 2009",2009,2674,"['Slaughter', 'High', 'George', 'Dugdale', 'Mark', 'Ezra', 'Peter', 'Mackenzie', 'Litten', '1986', 'Ah', 'silliness', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'was', 'originally', 'part', 'wave', 'holiday-themed', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'Danilo', 'Bach', 'Fred', 'Walton', 'had', 'same', 'idea', 'same', 'year', 'so', 'April', 'Fool', 'Day', 'became', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'Which', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'Bach', 'Walton', 'movie', 'ever', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'pile', 'junk', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'surprisingly', 'influential', 'one.Marty', 'Rantzen', 'Simon', 'Scuddamore', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'fatally', 'soon', 'movie', 'release', 'school', 'nerd', 'such', 'obvious', 'target', 'jocks', 'One', 'April', 'Fool', 'Day', ""'re"", 'particularly', 'nasty', 'result', 'accident', 'chemistry', 'almost', 'kills', 'Fast-forward', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'eight', 'kids', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'are', 'coming', 'back', 'tenth', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'When', 'get', 'there', 'however', 'find', 'school', 'been', 'closed', 'down', 'five', 'years', 'scheduled', 'demolition', 'last', 'month', 'are', 'only', 'eight', 'who', 'were', 'invited', 'No', 'not', 'obvious', 'setup', 'anything', 'decide', 'start', 'drinking', 'provided', 'alcohol', 'smoking', 'grass', 'being', 'generally', 'stupid', 'when', 'know', 'slasher', 'bent', 'revenge', 'kids', 'who', 'destroyed', 'life', 'years', 'before.It', 'entirely', 'unexceptional', ""'re"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'apart', 'slasher', 'movies', ""'re"", 'going', 'find', 'whole', 'lot', 'stupid', 'here', 'pick', 'apart', 'script', 'horrendous', 'acting', 'worse', 'lead', 'actresses', 'Caroline', 'Munro', 'Donna', 'Yeager', 'often', 'sound', 'confused', ""'re"", 'not', 'Shakespearean', 'production', 'lapse', 'theatrical', 'enunciation', 'fake', 'British', 'accents', 'camerawork', 'dismal', 'may', 'not', 'seem', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'almost', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'was', 'released', 'what', 'really', 'set', 'apart', 'form', 'pack', 'was', 'gore', 'effects', 'Back', 'eighties', 'gore', 'was', 'done', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'suggestion', 'witness', 'most', 'American', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'seventies', 'eighties', 'was', 'overplayed', 'camp', 'make', 'MPAA', 'realize', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'look', 'realistic', 'think', 'original', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'films', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'was', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'first', 'time', 'gore', 'effects', 'were', 'played', 'straight', 'few', 'exceptions', 'as', 'realistic', 'possible', 'given', 'budget', 'movie', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'horror', 'director', 'world', 'who', 'can', 'resist', 'temptation', 'go', 'top', 'once', 'while', 'So', ""'re"", 'fan', 'horror', 'movies', 'worth', 'watching', 'reason', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'really', 'awful', '**']",N/A

Things went too far when one of their jokes backfired disfiguring Marty for life!Its five years later and Marty is throwing a reunion for all his high school ""friends""-does he have a surprise for them! The prom queen, the jock, the class clown, the busybody, the rebel, and a few ""select"" others have all been invited to Marty's gala of gore. Five years ago Marty got mad...now he's gonna get even-in one riot of a reunion!Starring Caroline Munro, with Simon Scuddamore as Marty, Carmine Iaanacone, Billy Hartman, Gary Martin, Kelly Baker, Sally Cross, Michael Saffran, John Segal, Josephine Scandi, Donna Yeager, Marc Smith, Jon Clark, & Dick Randall as Manny.A Steve Minasian and Dick Randall presentationA George Dugdale, Mark Ezra, & Peter Litten filmMusic by Harry ManfrediniDirector of Photography Alan PudneyEditing by Jim ConnockProduced by Steve Minasian and Dick RandallWritten by George Dugdale, Mark Ezra & Peter LittenDirected by George DugdaleOk though Slaughter High was a low budget comical slasher film, its still a film to get and watch. The plot of the high school nerd kills his classmate wasn't done like it should have to me. The pranks played on him were mean but isn't that just typical for a nerd to get picked on like that in high school?But how could anyone trick someone thinking he's gonna lose his virginity with the pretty girl in the girls locker room? Especially since its his birthday on April Fools Day? How mean! Have some kind of sympathy! I guess kids can be really mean to the underdog. The last one they did to him was very cruel backfiring and getting his face burned, though they said it wasn't their fault yes it is!They drove him mad after that last prank Marty is now pist at them he ain't joking. No more give the nerd a swirly, jabbing him with a javelin, giving him an electric shock, hosing his private parts, all done while on video camera,-cruel if u ask me, now Marty's gonna get even with his classmates. Well the same bullies meet up at a class reunion five years later but someone is waiting for them not for a friendly welcome but a night of gore, revenge is sweet!The end was ridiculous because I thought it was going to be more than that. Simon Scuddamore played Marty Rantzen the nerd real good, sad that he committed suicide though. I wonder if he was picked on like that in high school? You never know. The music was not even scary it was actually funny. Where did Harry Manfredini find that music at?George Dugdale I know you could have directed this film better come on now. Why was it shot in England and not America? I thought it was America when I first saw it as a teenager but its actually a British made movie, with most British actors and few American actors like Simon Scuddamore and Marc Smith who played the high school coach. The killings weren't even scary.You can hear the Friday the 13th music in Slaughter High though. Did the makers of Friday the 13th really produce Slaughter High? I never saw Mark Ezra, Peter Litten or George Dugdale as producers of Friday the 13th. Nor Steve Minasian or Dick Randall's names are mentioned. Only Harry Manfredini who is the music producer of Friday the 13th but no one else.But anyway I think they should have a remake of Slaughter High and a sequel maybe and folks will like it better. When will this movie be released on DVD? I haven't seen that as yet only copies are available. If they decide to release it on DVD, a tribute to Simon Scuddamore should be made, and the making of Slaughter High. Incase some of you didn't know Slaughter High was originally titled April Fools Day.Slaughter High aka April Fools Day is not a good horror slasher movie but you can still look at it, not that cheesy like others I've seen.

230962,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,6300263487,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[1, 1]","Nope, this isn't a film about high school kids rocking out to the sounds of Mark Slaughter and co., this is a slasher film!  Slaughter High!!The film starts off with dorky Marty falling victim to the sadistic pranks of his fellow classmates.  If the first prank wasn't degrading enough(he gets over it rather quickly.  I sure wouldn't), the second one is a full blown disaster with poor Marty getting burned and disfigured from nitric acid.  Pranks which involve bunson burners, dangerous chemicals and laced marijuana will never turn out funny.In the slasher movie tradition, this can only mean revenge-deadly, bloody revenge.  Five years later, Marty arranges a fake ""reunion"" at the high school with only the gang that was responsible for the prank.  They all arrive, and even though the school is abandoned and clues are given that Marty is behind it all, the gang sets up camp for a night of partying.  Soon Marty, garbed in his high school jacket and a jester mask, is on the prowl, taking out the pranksters.  The insanely gorgeous Caroline Munroe is the star here, as well as Marty's prime target.Now, you may or may not have noticed that slasher flicks from the mid to late 80s are quite different in tone than those from the golden era of the early 80s.  Audiences now knew the tricks and cliches, and the film makers seem to be aware of this.  So when making a slasher movie, the aim was no longer to scare, but to play everything out more tongue in cheek and outrageous.  April Fool's Day also took this approach.  Hell, even Friday The 13th Part 6 was a comedy.  Some consider this the downfall of the genre, which is pretty much was, but we still got some entertaining films from it.  In Slaughter High, you can take the boneheaded actions of the characters with a grain of salt coz the film doesn't seem to be playing it straight anyway.  In a grungy, abandoned high school with the knowledge that a killer is running around, wouold you take a bath?  Alone?  Would you crawl under a riding lawnmower to fix it?  Alone?  Of course not, but who cares?  It's fun!It's not the goriest of slashers, but some of the deaths are rather brutal and memorable.  Harry Manfredini's score sounds as though he's recovered bits of a lost FT13TH film.The creepiest thing here is the knowledge that Simon Scuddamore, who played Marty, committed suicide shortly after the film's release.

Marty was the victim of such bulling done by a certain click. During one of the pranks, Marty is disfigured by both fire and acid. After 5 years a class reunion, consisting only of the click is held at the abandoned school house. After the first person is killed, the crowd decides to stay together, but then separates to get slashed one at a time.

230964,A3NPBG9YE84S63,6300263487,Tom P. the Underground Navigator,"[5, 5]","...In fact, it is my absolute FAVORITE only after George Romero's original ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968).  A bold claim to make, I know, but you know there's something special about a movie that isn't even available and yet has (to date) 42 enthusiastic Amazon reviews.  And if reading these reviews isn't evidence that ""Slaughter High"" is a love it or hate it movie, I don't know what is.  And I for one LOVE it.The slasher movie is considered to be a largely North American phenomenon but alas, the Brits come up with my favorite one of all time.  It's as if the writing/directing triple threat of Peter Litten, George Dugdale, and Mark Ezra sensed in 1985 that all of the formulaic cliches of 1981-era slashers had all been done to death when played straight and an entry of a more trashy tongue-in-cheek nature was in order.  And they succeeded brilliantly in creating the best one possible.The opening 20 minutes or so are priceless.  I think that anyone who was ever the victim of some type of cruel hazing in high school or middle school will identify with Marty and love this portion.  Simon Scuddamore shows comic genius in this role.  Even the fact that Marty gets over the initial shower stunt so quickly and seems not to take the haranguing seriously when confronted again by the louts at his locker, shown by the fact that he even accepts their dubious offer for a ""wonder joint,"" keeps with the comic tone of the early part of the film.This movie is delightfully FUN.  It has that raw mid-'80s trash feel of say ""Bad Girls Dormitory"" (also 1985) that can never be reproduced.  Those responsible for the final prank and hence severely burning Marty are invited to a party in their alma mater and that's just what this movie is, one big party in low budget slasher heaven.  There is abundant gore, sex, nudity, beer drinking, weed toking, and even harder drug use to boot.  (It is assumed that you're viewing the authentic UNRATED version.  Accept no substitutes.  I myself own a still-sealed VHS copy of it that I will preserve forever, as well as a more common beat-up ex-rental copy to watch.)  This movie was a rose among thorns of crowded 1987-era video store horror movie shelves.It's low budget to be sure, but the gore effects, handled by co-director Peter Litten and his Coast To Coast Productions, are top notch.  The killings are so fun; from the grinding splatter via tractor trailer to the belly bursting to the electrocution during lovemaking, this delivers the goods.And I just LOVE Harry Manfredini's music!  It's got that cheesy mid-'80s post-punk synthesizer feel that brings you back to the time this one was made.And, as a guy, one reason I have to confess that I keep coming back to ""Slaughter High"" time and time again is because it features perhaps the most beautiful girl in the world, the young British lass Kelly Baker (who appeared in the earlier British slasher ""Don't Open Till Christmas"" (1984), also a Dick Randall/Steve Minasian co-production).  She appears here as nice girl Nancy, and is introduced most prominently about 20 minutes into the movie, when she is picked up by head goofball Skip (Carmine Iannaccone) on the way to the reunion.  She is admittedly filled out but is far more beautiful than the anorexic waif models of today.  As an American, I adore her quaint British charm and gorgeous golden hair and dazzling smile.  If I had the resources, I'd probably start a Kelly Baker fan site.Finally, some have criticized the ending but I think it shows that the movie is all in good fun and that the killings were not meant to be taken seriously.It's great to see showings of a relatively obscure slasher like ""Slaughter High"" turning up today on mainstream outlets like On Demand.  I myself first came to appreciate this film when TNT showed it on ""Monstervision"" (with legendary Texan drive-in critic Joe Bob Briggs) in the late '90s.  Will someone just please wake up and give this movie its long overdue DVD release?  It truly is a classic.",5,One of the best movies of all time!!,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,4002,"['fact', 'absolute', 'FAVORITE', 'only', 'George', 'Romero', 'original', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', '1968', 'bold', 'claim', 'make', 'know', 'know', 'something', 'special', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'available', 'yet', 'date', '42', 'enthusiastic', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'reading', 'reviews', ""n't"", 'evidence', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'one', 'LOVE', 'it.The', 'slasher', 'movie', 'considered', 'be', 'largely', 'North', 'American', 'phenomenon', 'alas', 'Brits', 'come', 'up', 'favorite', 'one', 'time', 'writing/directing', 'triple', 'threat', 'Peter', 'Litten', 'George', 'Dugdale', 'Mark', 'Ezra', 'sensed', '1985', 'formulaic', 'cliches', '1981-era', 'slashers', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'when', 'played', 'straight', 'entry', 'more', 'trashy', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'nature', 'was', 'order', 'succeeded', 'brilliantly', 'creating', 'best', 'one', 'possible.The', 'opening', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'priceless', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'ever', 'victim', 'type', 'cruel', 'hazing', 'high', 'school', 'middle', 'school', 'will', 'identify', 'Marty', 'love', 'portion', 'Simon', 'Scuddamore', 'comic', 'genius', 'role', 'Even', 'fact', 'Marty', 'initial', 'shower', 'stunt', 'so', 'quickly', 'not', 'take', 'haranguing', 'seriously', 'when', 'confronted', 'again', 'louts', 'locker', 'shown', 'fact', 'even', 'accepts', 'dubious', 'offer', 'wonder', 'joint', 'comic', 'tone', 'early', 'part', 'film.This', 'movie', 'delightfully', 'FUN', 'raw', ""mid-'80s"", 'trash', 'feel', 'say', 'Bad', 'Girls', 'Dormitory', 'also', '1985', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'reproduced', 'responsible', 'final', 'prank', 'hence', 'severely', 'burning', 'Marty', 'are', 'invited', 'party', 'alma', 'mater', 'just', 'what', 'movie', 'one', 'big', 'party', 'low', 'budget', 'slasher', 'heaven', 'abundant', 'gore', 'sex', 'nudity', 'beer', 'drinking', 'weed', 'toking', 'even', 'harder', 'drug', 'use', 'boot', 'assumed', ""'re"", 'viewing', 'authentic', 'UNRATED', 'version', 'Accept', 'substitutes', 'own', 'still-sealed', 'VHS', 'copy', 'will', 'preserve', 'forever', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'common', 'beat-up', 'ex-rental', 'copy', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'rose', 'thorns', 'crowded', '1987-era', 'video', 'store', 'horror', 'movie', 'shelves.It', 'low', 'budget', 'be', 'sure', 'gore', 'effects', 'handled', 'co-director', 'Peter', 'Litten', 'Coast', 'Coast', 'Productions', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'killings', 'are', 'so', 'fun', 'grinding', 'splatter', 'tractor', 'trailer', 'belly', 'bursting', 'electrocution', 'lovemaking', 'goods.And', 'just', 'LOVE', 'Harry', 'Manfredini', 'music', 'got', 'cheesy', ""mid-'80s"", 'post-punk', 'synthesizer', 'feel', 'back', 'time', 'one', 'was', 'made.And', 'guy', 'one', 'reason', 'have', 'confess', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'perhaps', 'most', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'world', 'young', 'British', 'lass', 'Kelly', 'Baker', 'who', 'appeared', 'earlier', 'British', 'slasher', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Open', 'Till', 'Christmas', '1984', 'also', 'Dick', 'Randall/Steve', 'Minasian', 'co-production', 'here', 'nice', 'girl', 'Nancy', 'introduced', 'most', 'prominently', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'head', 'goofball', 'Skip', 'Carmine', 'Iannaccone', 'way', 'reunion', 'admittedly', 'filled', 'out', 'far', 'more', 'beautiful', 'anorexic', 'waif', 'models', 'today', 'American', 'adore', 'quaint', 'British', 'charm', 'gorgeous', 'golden', 'hair', 'dazzling', 'smile', 'had', 'resources', ""'d"", 'probably', 'start', 'Kelly', 'Baker', 'fan', 'site.Finally', 'have', 'criticized', 'ending', 'think', 'movie', 'all', 'good', 'fun', 'killings', 'were', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously.It', 'great', 'see', 'showings', 'relatively', 'obscure', 'slasher', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'turning', 'up', 'today', 'mainstream', 'outlets', 'Demand', 'first', 'came', 'appreciate', 'film', 'when', 'TNT', 'showed', 'Monstervision', 'legendary', 'Texan', 'drive-in', 'critic', 'Joe', 'Bob', 'Briggs', 'late', ""'90s"", 'Will', 'someone', 'just', 'please', 'wake', 'up', 'give', 'movie', 'long', 'overdue', 'DVD', 'release', 'truly', 'classic']",N/A
