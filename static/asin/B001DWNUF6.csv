Even on the DVD case it talks about how Pete thought it was crap and all that, well I put it on and watched it, it was Fantastic, I mean absolutley great.I have no idea why some critics thought the show was a bust, unless they were speaking of the set adn how it looked on film, thanks to modern technology, the use of zoom-ins and what have you dont make the stage look bare or too big (one complaint I heard).The concert is only 62 mins long, so its not a long and boring thing for those with A.D.D.The show was filmed with 6 camera's using 35 film, unheard of for filming a concert, the norm was 16 mm or later straight video.  The forst thing I noticed from that is the show has a theater look to it, just very high quality picture, superb lighting and the 5.1 remix is stunning.This is the 2nd to last show with Keith Moon, and he still played excellent.  Dont let the critics fool you on this DVD, it is totally awesome.....the version of ""My Wife"" is probably the best you will ever see (or hear).""Who are you"" is performed, just 2 weeks after they wrapped up recoding it in the studio.enjoy!",5,Absolutely Fantastic....a Must own!,1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,1229,"['ever', 'heard', 'rumour', 'was', '1977', 'Kilburn', 'show', 'sucked', 'sand', 'was', 'disregarded', 'entry', 'fihm', 'Kids', 'are', 'Alright', 'Even', 'DVD', 'case', 'how', 'Pete', 'thought', 'was', 'crap', 'well', 'put', 'watched', 'was', 'Fantastic', 'mean', 'absolutley', 'great.I', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'critics', 'thought', 'show', 'was', 'bust', 'were', 'speaking', 'set', 'how', 'looked', 'film', 'thanks', 'modern', 'technology', 'use', 'zoom-ins', 'what', 'have', 'dont', 'make', 'stage', 'look', 'bare', 'too', 'big', 'one', 'complaint', 'heard', '.The', 'concert', 'only', '62', 'mins', 'long', 'not', 'long', 'boring', 'thing', 'A.D.D.The', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', '6', 'camera', 'using', '35', 'film', 'unheard', 'filming', 'concert', 'norm', 'was', '16', 'mm', 'later', 'straight', 'video', 'forst', 'thing', 'noticed', 'show', 'theater', 'look', 'just', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'picture', 'superb', 'lighting', '5.1', 'remix', 'stunning.This', '2nd', 'last', 'show', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'still', 'played', 'excellent', 'Dont', 'let', 'critics', 'fool', 'DVD', 'totally', 'awesome', '..the', 'version', 'Wife', 'probably', 'best', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'hear', 'Who', 'are', 'performed', 'just', '2', 'weeks', 'wrapped', 'up', 'recoding', 'studio.enjoy']",N/A

I recently used that term to describe a bad movie I did a review on, but I nicked the term from him in his comments about this show. It's too bad, fans waited decades on this, but sometimes when a performer refuses to release something, products like this are the reason. It was a swansong from the original line-up of the band, and here they just fizzled.Though the band clearly wasn't ready for this show, this release does have its good side. The film stock itself is very good, with full, clear sound, dynamic color (or ""colour,"" as the Brits say), and for once, John Entwistle gets equal face time. So many photos and film clips of The Who don't feature him at all, and just like Keith Moon, the band is a lesser entity without him; it's good to SEE him as one of the featured players, as well as hearing him.But the performance suffers from the four members not even saying ""hello"" to one another in many, many months, then trying to pull this off. Though John Entwistle's bass playing is always technically superb, even he made a few blunders in this show, mostly in a song's structure, jumping to a wrong part and whatnot, but his mistakes aren't as pervasive as the rest. Roger Daltry often forgets lyrics, singing the wrong ones, and on ""Dreaming From The Waist"" (Townshend's most hated Who song), just blanks out while the rest continue without him until he finds his place. Keith Moon, the poster child for hyperactivity and Attention Deficit, let his health dive-bomb right into the ground while living in California, but somehow manages to get through the show (but doesn't have as rough a time as he did in the Shepperton show from 1978); he is much worse for the wear, compared to earlier shows, and Pete Townshend was in an awful mood, and only wanted to finish and go home.It's a bad show, especially in comparison with disc Two, their 1969 London Coliseum show. This is a technically bad film, terrible production values, but a good document of The Who at their best. There are many glitches here, but it's a FANTASTIC  show. Kilburn should have been the bonus disc.This set would be of more interest to the die-hard fan (like myself), but regardless of who you are, the 1969 footage is well-worth watching.",4,One bad show and ond good show,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,2318,"['Roger', 'Daltrey', 'once', 'described', 'Who', '1977', 'Kilburn', 'show', 'quote', 'abortion', 'recently', 'used', 'term', 'describe', 'bad', 'movie', 'did', 'review', 'nicked', 'term', 'comments', 'show', 'too', 'bad', 'fans', 'waited', 'decades', 'sometimes', 'when', 'performer', 'release', 'something', 'products', 'are', 'reason', 'was', 'swansong', 'original', 'line-up', 'band', 'here', 'just', 'band', 'clearly', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'show', 'release', 'have', 'good', 'side', 'film', 'stock', 'very', 'good', 'full', 'clear', 'sound', 'dynamic', 'color', 'colour', 'Brits', 'say', 'once', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'equal', 'face', 'time', 'So', 'many', 'photos', 'film', 'clips', 'Who', 'do', ""n't"", 'feature', 'just', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'band', 'lesser', 'entity', 'good', 'SEE', 'one', 'featured', 'players', 'as', 'well', 'hearing', 'performance', 'suffers', 'four', 'members', 'not', 'even', 'saying', 'hello', 'one', 'many', 'many', 'months', 'then', 'trying', 'pull', 'off', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'bass', 'playing', 'always', 'technically', 'superb', 'even', 'made', 'few', 'blunders', 'show', 'mostly', 'song', 'structure', 'jumping', 'wrong', 'part', 'whatnot', 'mistakes', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'pervasive', 'rest', 'Roger', 'Daltry', 'often', 'lyrics', 'singing', 'wrong', 'ones', 'Dreaming', 'Waist', 'Townshend', 'most', 'hated', 'Who', 'song', 'just', 'blanks', 'out', 'rest', 'continue', 'place', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'poster', 'child', 'hyperactivity', 'Attention', 'Deficit', 'let', 'health', 'dive-bomb', 'right', 'ground', 'living', 'California', 'somehow', 'get', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'time', 'did', 'Shepperton', 'show', '1978', 'much', 'worse', 'wear', 'compared', 'earlier', 'shows', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'was', 'awful', 'mood', 'only', 'wanted', 'finish', 'go', 'home.It', 'bad', 'show', 'especially', 'comparison', 'disc', 'Two', '1969', 'London', 'Coliseum', 'show', 'technically', 'bad', 'film', 'terrible', 'production', 'values', 'good', 'document', 'Who', 'best', 'are', 'many', 'glitches', 'here', 'FANTASTIC', 'show', 'Kilburn', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'bonus', 'disc.This', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'interest', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'regardless', 'who', 'are', '1969', 'footage', 'well-worth', 'watching']",N/A

1183381,A3VUXYHJGL9WWX,B001DWNUF6,"bass boy ""music fan""","[55, 64]","We Who fans finally get to see the infamous Kilburn 1977 gig here. I've seen the Kilburn footage (minus ""Dreaming from the Waist""), and it's really good. It's wonderful to see a pre-LP version of ""Who Are You"" at this show, that bumps and grinds much more than the studio version would almost a year later. Drummer Keith Moon is in fiery form here - much more than he was at Shepperton Studios (for ""The Kids Are Alright"" movie) some five months later. I think Pete Townshend and John Entwistle might have sounded a little better at Shepperton, but Moon is in better form here on the Kilburn disc. He hits the drums harder, faster and is more precise. Don't get me wrong - I will take any Who footage, especially with Moon and The Ox. Be sure and watch what happens, at the tail end of ""My Wife,"" when someone touches Townshend's guitar picks on Townshend's amp head. YIkes. Don't mess with the Godfather of punk rock, for sure. The camera stays on Townshend, who lets it be known to the guy - and the entire audience - that it's uncool to mess with The Who's stage equipment.The ragged nature of the band here, most of the time, actually works for them during the Kilburn set. There's an edge to the quartet's efforts, and although there are flubs - Moon comes in too early during the intro of ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" and Townshend doesn't get all of his mojo on guitar until about 10 minutes into the show. Townshend is wilder here, jumping across the stage, bouncing, hitting his head on his Les Paul and becoming a human cyclone, wrapping himself up in his own guitar cord, than he was at Shepperton. Like the Shepperton footage, the Kilburn set is a keeper.Hopefully, the London Coliseum set will be equally as impressive ...",5,4.5 stars for the Kilburn performance section ....,1221091200,"09 11, 2008",2008,1732,"['Who', 'fans', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'infamous', 'Kilburn', '1977', 'gig', 'here', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Kilburn', 'footage', 'Dreaming', 'Waist', 'really', 'good', 'wonderful', 'see', 'pre-LP', 'version', 'Who', 'Are', 'show', 'bumps', 'much', 'more', 'studio', 'version', 'would', 'almost', 'year', 'later', 'Drummer', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'fiery', 'form', 'here', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'Shepperton', 'Studios', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Alright', 'movie', 'five', 'months', 'later', 'think', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'might', 'have', 'sounded', 'little', 'better', 'Shepperton', 'Moon', 'better', 'form', 'here', 'Kilburn', 'disc', 'drums', 'harder', 'faster', 'more', 'precise', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'will', 'take', 'Who', 'footage', 'especially', 'Moon', 'Ox', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'what', 'tail', 'end', 'My', 'Wife', 'when', 'someone', 'Townshend', 'guitar', 'picks', 'Townshend', 'amp', 'head', 'YIkes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'Godfather', 'punk', 'rock', 'sure', 'camera', 'Townshend', 'who', 'be', 'known', 'guy', 'entire', 'audience', 'uncool', 'mess', 'Who', 'stage', 'equipment.The', 'ragged', 'nature', 'band', 'here', 'most', 'time', 'actually', 'Kilburn', 'set', 'edge', 'quartet', 'efforts', 'are', 'flubs', 'Moon', 'too', 'early', 'intro', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Fooled', 'Again', 'Townshend', ""n't"", 'get', 'mojo', 'guitar', '10', 'minutes', 'show', 'Townshend', 'wilder', 'here', 'jumping', 'stage', 'bouncing', 'hitting', 'head', 'Les', 'Paul', 'becoming', 'human', 'cyclone', 'wrapping', 'up', 'own', 'guitar', 'cord', 'was', 'Shepperton', 'Shepperton', 'footage', 'Kilburn', 'set', 'keeper.Hopefully', 'London', 'Coliseum', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'equally', 'impressive']",N/A

1183383,A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST,B001DWNUF6,Best Of All,"[0, 2]","Two years off the road, The Who scheduled this one concert to be chronicled for the film, The Kids Are Alright. The band members deemed the footage unusable and they ""reshot"" the concert in 1978 at the Shepperton Studios, which was the only gig for that year and the last performance by drummer Keith Moon.At North London's Gaumont State Theatre in Kilburn, the 15-song set again demonstrated the power of the band, even if there was some fine-tuning that (understandably) occurred throughout by each member. At the end of I'm Free - the eighth number - Pete Townshend pointedly told director Jeff Stein that the concert was not worth filming. And there was particular focus on Moon, who did not appear to be in the greatest of health, but performed as well as could be expected after so much time away from the stage.The event marked the debut of a new song, Who Are You, and the concert - no matter the harsh pronouncements from the foursome - was a kick-off to an incredible period of creativity and popularity, even in the face of professional turmoil that would have derailed many bands.The bonus concert is from the 1969 Tommy tour - at London's Coliseum - and shot with 16mm film. It is a performance not found preserved in a record company vault, but essentially stumbled upon in the corner of the office of the band's former management company.

Townshend's guitar could have been up in the mix a bit more, Moon's drumming definitely shows signs of fatigue, but it's still a fantastic document to the greatest live rock and roll band of all time. There are more than enough moments throughout that will surely send shivers down the spine of any REAL Who fan (for instance, Townshend towards the end of ""My Wife""). It is truly a testament to how a band SHOULD play when lucky enough to be on a stage. With complete and total abandon.

The band is a bit rusty; it had been over a year since they'd played live.  After Pete Townshend forgets the break in ""I'm Free"" and ends the song too early, he comments that they're wasting film.

Many of the songs from this concert were re-recorded at Shepperton Studios the following year and the performances of ""Baba O'Reilly"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" from that show made it into ""The Kids are Alright.""While the performance has a lot of energy, Roger forgets many lyrics, Keith is often out of sync, Townshend is angry, and Entwistle, while incapable of a bad performance, certainly gives one of his least memorable. When I saw the set list for the DVD, I was immediately surprised that some of this footage was not included in ""The Kids are Alright,"" as the performances of ""Baba O'Reilly"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" from Shepperton were, in my opinion, the best part of that film. When I watched this dvd, I understood why; the performances are entertaining enough, and there are a few songs here and there I felt should have been in the film (""I Can't Explain,"" ""My Wife,"" ""Pinball Wizard,"" ""Summertime Blues,"" and ""Shakin' All Over"" are all decent performances), but the problem is that the band, for the most part, was playing completely out of synch with each other. Whereas the performance from the London Coliseum on the second disc captures the band in peak form, the performance from Kilburn feels chaotic, out of control, and unrestrained--and not in a good way. The performance from London is terrific, but it unfortunately suffers from poor lighting (it is very dark); it is from this performance that ""Young Man Blues"" from ""The Kids are Alright"" is taken. I feel this performance is similar to the one from the ""Live at Leeds"" album.The bottom line: While Who fans will enjoy this, at this price, one could buy either ""The Kids are Alright,"" in a terrific special edition, or the ""Live At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970"" dvd, both of which feature superior performances.",4,Historical Value: Five.

Even 70's bootlegs, showed this band to be under-appreciated in the U.S. This live view is top of the pops in my book as a capture of The Who excitement from the cheap seats. The Kilburn set of '77 represents the packaged deal,with the stage mainly led by Daltrey/Townsend re-created over and over after Moon's absence.The numbers are admirably performed, but, to me just a delicious build-up for the bonus disc,the '69 Coliseum show, which captures their raw and fuller force of the Who vocally and instrumentally unleashed that thrills considerably more. The shortcomings in the grainier 16 mm. footage passes quickly, allowing you to see the frenetic Moon energy in the shadows fueling the Who machine as Townsend thrashes on and Daltrey punctuates with vocal bravado. These two held-back live performances put them ahead of the Beatles and Stones in live performance in the same time-frame because, here, the lads were not forced into the later Daltrey/Townsend (Lennon-McCartney) stereotype to sway the American photogenic media, minimizing Entwistle and Moon. This Coliseum show captures entirely the excitment of a newer, raw force that I felt I experienced in San Francisco when they mesmerized the audience entire, wall to wall, leaving you tingling for days as if from stardust.

1183393,A2OM1KMB1OHK,B001DWNUF6,Gerald Heffner,"[3, 3]","This DVD is really two concerts, despite one of them being dubbed an ""extra"" so we'll split this review in twain:==KILBURN '77==Ah, the infamous Kilburn show. I believe a lot of the inaccuracies and inconsistencies in this show can be attributed to the fact that The Who had been away from the stage for a whole year. Still, anyone who knows The Who will tell you that a ""perfect"" Who show will often include fits of Townshend rage, a flubbed line or two by Roger, and pervasive lunacy care of Keith Moon. If it weren't for John locking the whole thing down as the immobile musical anchor who knows where we'd be today. DO NOT touch Pete's amp. You'll probably lose an eye.Being off the road for so long The Who are in raw form. It takes a song or two for them to find their stride. Oddly enough, Keith Moon is arguably more on the ball during this show than the rest of the band. It goes to show that he didn't just bash away with no rhyme or reason. He actually was paying close attention to what was happening on stage. Also, he is in considerably better form musically during this show than he was later on at Shepperton. The way he hammers away during ""Substitute"" and ""My Wife"" is classic Keith Moon. His monologue before ""Behind Blue Eyes"" is a bit tough to take considering how little time he actually had left. Just remember to keep Keith happy and let him do his Uncle Ernie bit.It's the hard-rockers that really stand out during the Kilburn show, those songs that lend themselves to being jammed on with wild abandon. ""My Wife"" rocks hard and ""Summertime Blues"" sounds just as good as it ever did during the ""Live at Leeds"" days. The same goes ""Shakin' All Over"" and ""My Generation"" the latter in particular featuring John going absolutely ballistic on his bass solo as well as what appears to be a Roger-inspired romp through a verse of ""Join Together."" Pete is all over the stage the whole night and shreds quite nicely on just about every song. He does lose his enthusiasm a bit after ""I'm Free"" but seems to regain it quickly. Of special note is the oft-mentioned ""Who Are You"" which is extremely raw and definitely a different animal that what would show up on vinyl a few months later. Also, it's my opinion that the performance of ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" at the Kilburn concert beats the hell out of the Shepperton gig by several degrees.Kilburn is one of those concerts that I watched through one eye the first time through. I knew what to expect; I knew there were a lot of issues, errors, and tension, but after several viewings I've found how to appreciate it. In terms of The Who as the original four-piece band this is definitely their last great concert. It's really The Who at their roughest which is what a lot of fans crave. The banter with the crowd is fantastic, the band despite the musical snafus seem to be getting on well and having a good time of it and there are some classic one-liners from Keith, my favorite being his revelation to the audience of why they're being recorded as well: ""Somebody says something libelous and we sue 'em!""==LONDON COLISEUM '69==For me personally this was the real attraction of the Kilburn DVD. I love this era of The Who so having any sort of visual record is something I'm going to jump on. The concert set list is virtually identical to the legendary ""Live at Leeds"" show minus ""Substitute"" and ""Magic Bus."" The audio quality dips every once in a while especially with respect to Pete's guitar which can sometimes sound like it's being played from a building or two away.The video is something else entirely. It retains some artifacts and a lot of the shots, especially the wider angles on the whole band, tend to be grainy and poorly lit.  A lot of the time the video is locked in on one angle for minutes at a time. This is explained up-front and on-screen just before the show. The Coliseum was lit for the stage show, not the film crew, so they pretty much had to make do with what was available. Despite that fact, the concert is entirely watchable. I like to think of this show as almost like a professionally released bootleg recording. Keep the lights off and get a good set of headphones. After a drink or two you'll think you're THERE.The entire performance is high-octane Who. This is due in no small part to getting to see Keith Moon in all his early splendor. He is a wild man. The camera is on him for a good chunk of ""Shakin' All Over"" so get your fill. You get to see him with a better picture on the ""Isle of Wight"" DVD, but only if you want to deal with a truncated version of ""Tommy."" Some of the banter exchanged with Pete during the introduction to ""A Quick One"" is positively Python-esque. Speaking of Pete, he's remarkably less talkative between songs (aside from the aforementioned banter with Keith) and he addresses this near the end of the show where he mentions feeling uncomfortable and awkward performing in the home of the English National Opera. He does make some amusing asides about if The Who took over 7 days a week how performances would be considerably less high-brow, but the seats would be more comfortable.I find this whole performance fascinating and it would surely make a fine addition to any Who collection. However, given the audio hiccups and the overall picture quality I can see why it was included as part of a larger whole. In today's video market where people are used to bleeding-edge 1080p high definition 3D whatever-the-hell I'm sure a lot of uneducated consumers would get up in arms about the lower quality picture of the Coliseum show. For those of us that know better we can simply enjoy what we have and thank our creator-being of choice that there's anything to see at all.",5,DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ADJUST THE AMPLIFIER,1286496000,"10 8,

Pumphrey ""the movie & music man""","[1, 1]","This might be called The Who Live at Kilburn but actually 2 concerts,the main attraction is the relativly short Kilbun(a little over an hour shot on 35 MM) show from 1977,Keith Moon would pass away not too long after that,There are real powerhouse preformances here they play a lot of songs from ""Who's Next"",Pete Townsend loses his temper during the end of John Entwistle's ""My Wife"" knocks an amp down,looks likes someone was messing with his equipment,actually he seems in a pretty bad mood for pretty much the whole show,Daltey and Entwistle are pretty calm an chipper,and Moon was is usual loony self,he is surely missed,there will never be another skinman like him again,all the drummers they used later just were not the same.I think that the late BJ Wilson from Procol Harum,or Soft Machine's Phil Howrard would have been great replacement drummers for Moon(their styles were very similar) instead of Kenny Jones,etc. There are some flubs in the performance but that just adds to the charm,the Kilburn show looks darn good on Blu Ray! Next is a 1969 show at the London Coliseum which is filmed on very grainy 16 MM film,so the visuals are not the greatest,it's the performances that shine here,not to mentiom Mr. Townsend was in a great mood for this show! A great show of late 60's Who!

This concert may be a bit less polished than the 1970 ""Isle of Wight"" DVD (which has been available for several years now), but nevertheless it is The Who as nature intended.

Indeed you get the 1977 Kilburn set that was done in preparation for the Kids are Alright. While some argue that this is not the best Who period, the playing is fantastic. It also provides a showcase for their early 70's material that unfortunately has been little documented on film. The film quality is good but rough. Pete is in great form and his guitar playing is the best ever, John Entwistle's bass playing is unusually good. While some think that Keith Moon showed signs of slowing down due to years of abuse, this is not that apparent, except maybe for his horrible suit.The second DVD which contains a set from 1969 and which is low-quality from a film point of view, is historically even more important. This is the era that most Who fans finds was their strongest, just post-Tommy. The set is the same as on the Who at Leeds album and is close to that of the Isle of Wright DVD. The Isle of Wright is much better filmed but since here you get it in addition to the Kilburn set you can't complain.Overall the quality is lower from comparable sets but musically the set is incredible.

Absolutely the most memorable concert I ever went to. They were so loud we actually moved back from the stage, (We were only 20-30 ft from the stage to start), back when they had unassigned seating (standing). Ears rang for days, now that's a concert! Their performance here was a little off for this one but is still a piece of Who history. Some of the band members had drug problems and it showed in their performances on occasions. Too bad Keith couldn't be saved but Pete wasn't as bad and later got things together. This was a very special band that played to the people and the times well. This brings back a lot of lost memories, some good and not so good times. The audio is remarkable for such an old recording as well as the video,(Blu-ray), it's no Jeff Beck Live at Ronnie Scott's but still very decent. Any Who or classic rock fan that doesn't have this isn't a Who or classic rock fan. Play it loud, play it proud!!I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.1. Performance2. Quality of Audio3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)1.***2.****3.****Bands that wish to have there performances recorded and recognised should be held to a standard.

The band clearly knew the whole show, put on for an invited audience, would not be shown in its entirety in The Kids Are Alright. If you've seen The Kids Are Alright with audio commentary, you know that this performance was done against the wishes of the band and they don't come across as a happy bunch of guys during the show. They weren't a tight musical unit a year removed from touring. Stein insisted on new Who performances to go with the footage from their past. As it turns out, none of this concert footage was used in the movie (only footage from this show that appears in 'Kids' is during the end credits with the pissed band walking to their dressing room backstage and slamming the door in the cameraman's face after the show.Thanks to DVDs and the demand, the release of this show makes sense today. Roger warns everyone at the outset that they may not be the tightest live act for this show because they hadn't rehearsed most of the songs in a full year. The band nearly falls apart completely on ""Dreaming From the Waist"" and during ""Pinball Wizard"". Daltrey tells the audience after ""Tommy's Holiday Camp"" and 'here it is again in the correct key!.The music, despite some flaws is great and while you will hear all of these songs played live on other Who DVDs, you won't find any with picture quality as good as this Kilburn show. It was shot in 35 mm with six cameras. This more than makes up for the flaws which more or less puts The Who on par with your standard , then contemporary punk band only much more talented with the exception of maybe The Clash.The bonus disc is a bit of a shocker because it's so extensive . 70 minutes of an unreleased live show in London in 1969. This is included as a bonus! The picture quality isn't great on some songs but there's more than enough material here to make up for that. I'm guessing Townshend and Daltrey felt the Kilburn concert was too sloppy to stand up on its own for a DVD release. What you end up with is an extensive library of Who in concert in a single release.This is THE ONE Who in Concert DVD to buy if you are planning to buy just one. If not, then there's about 6 others out there to get dating from '70 to '04 on Amazon and more recent if you pick up their Encore Series shows on DVD.Of course if you prefer just a great Who disc getThe Who - The Kids Are Alright (Special Edition).

It's no surprise that the guitar is mixed down much of the time.Of greater interest is the 1969 London Coliseum performance on Disc Two. Despite the rough, imperfect quality of the filming(16mm film & direct to 2-track audio), the group performs a stunning set, comparable in quality to their legendary ""Live at Leeds"" show(and with a similar song line-up). Yes, the 2-camera filming is sometimes blurry & grainy, and their are occasional moments where, for a second, the screen goes white at the end of a film roll. Yes, there are occasional scratches in the film print & negative, but the essence of a great performance is here. You can view a 75 minute edited version(featuring the parts with the best picture quality) or you can view a bonus section with the entire rock opera ""Tommy""(or as much of it as they played that night). The film footage of the supplemental ""Tommy"" section is 99% complete, though there is a 2 minute section(during ""Christmas"" & ""The Acid Queen"") where the audio recording crew lost the sound feed, and so audience-recorded sound is substituted. I just wish that the transition between the full-fidelity audio & the audience-recorded audio could have been done more smoothly.Still, this two-disc set is priced incredibly low, and it's packed with value.

1183410,AJ5V9EBLVBHAW,B001DWNUF6,Robert,"[0, 0]","This is a really interesting Who performance. Even though Pete Townshend makes it clear that he thought the performances were awful, I think he was being a little too hard on himself and the band. It was a rough show, but it's much better than Pete says. Roger even apologizes before it starts, saying they hadn't played the songs in about a year. The concert was filmed by director Jeff Stein for possible inclusion in the film ""The Kids Are Alright"". Stein wanted some new live footage in order to include ""Who's Next"" era performances in the film. The only song they used from Kilburn was ""My Wife"", which was included on the soundtrack album for ""The Kids Are Alright"". A second concert filmed by Jeff Stein, not included in this release, took place at Shepperton Film Studios with a small audience. Unfortunately they missed an opportunity to include that performance here. ""Baba O'Riley"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" from Shepperton made the cut for ""The Kids Are Alright"".Also included in this DVD is a show from the London Coliseum in 1969. The sound quality of the Kilburn show is quite good, but the London show is a bit worse. ""Young Man Blues"" from this appears in ""The Kids Are Alright"" as well. The London show is a good one, despite its' sound quality. It is a bonus, however. The main attraction here is the Kilburn show. And one interesting feature of Kilburn is a rough ad-libbed version of ""Who Are You"" (part of the ""My Generation"" Medley). This is the only official release of a live concert performance of ""Who Are You"" with Keith Moon on drums.

Roger and Pete are Roger and Pete in all the DVD's, but Keith is just so adorable and fascinating to watch and usually there isn't enough drummer footage in concert DVD's. This DVD gives great views and angles and a good amount of time to Keith. I was almost as excited as he was at the point where he re-performs his Uncle Ernie lines from Tommy. John Entwistle is my all time favorite bassist; he plays his bass like it's a guitar! This is a very special DVD. I'm just back to buy my son his own copy for his 19th birthday.

As noted, the concert performace is coarse in spots since the band hadn't peformed together in a years time.  There are glitches during the performance that quite obviously irritate the band members and remind viewers that what they are seeing was filmed live and includes all of the warts.What's also included is all of the energy of a Who concert.  Pete Townshend's windmill guitar strumming, Keith Moon's frenetic drum playing (including flinging the drum sticks around and losing them time and again...) -- side note: if someone wanted to put together a drinking game for play while watching this film they'd probably want to include Townshend's windmill strumming and Moon's losing the drumsticks as the requirements to take another swig.  It wouldn't take long at all to find the participants in such a drinking game pretty well inebriated ;-) -- and of course Roger Daltrey's strong lead vocals.  All of which make bassist John Entwistle's performance seem a bit, well, stiff.  No one could blame the guy really, as the rest of his band mate's certainly seemed to have the stage pretty well covered, especially with Townshend's jumping/hopping around the stage repeatedly.The Who At Kilburn is a fascinating film largely because it even exists on film.  It was filmed on 35mm film which is rather unusual for concert footage.  Thankfully though that medium works well for providing a master for encoding to high def media, and thanks to that the product that viewers get on Blu-ray is, at least at this point technologically, as good as can be achieved on optical disc media.Note that the Blu-ray disc is NOT RATED.  If it were rated, it would probably have been given an R rating for the utterances of the f-bomb at several points throughout the course of the show.Most definitely worth viewing, and an item that serious Who fans should add to their collection.",4,An interesting peek at Who history,1226966400,"11 18, 2008",2008,2101,"['First', 'up', 'salute', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Amazon', 'few', 'featured', 'write', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'covering', 'artifact', 'rock', 'concert', 'history', 'finally', 'made', 'way', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'noted', 'concert', 'performace', 'coarse', 'spots', 'band', 'had', ""n't"", 'peformed', 'together', 'years', 'time', 'are', 'glitches', 'performance', 'quite', 'obviously', 'irritate', 'band', 'members', 'remind', 'viewers', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'was', 'filmed', 'live', 'warts.What', 'also', 'included', 'energy', 'Who', 'concert', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'windmill', 'guitar', 'strumming', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'frenetic', 'drum', 'playing', 'including', 'flinging', 'drum', 'losing', 'time', 'again', 'side', 'note', 'someone', 'wanted', 'put', 'together', 'drinking', 'game', 'play', 'watching', 'film', ""'d"", 'probably', 'want', 'include', 'Townshend', 'windmill', 'strumming', 'Moon', 'losing', 'drumsticks', 'requirements', 'take', 'swig', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'find', 'participants', 'such', 'drinking', 'game', 'pretty', 'well', 'inebriated', 'course', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'strong', 'lead', 'vocals', 'make', 'bassist', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'performance', 'seem', 'bit', 'well', 'stiff', 'one', 'could', 'blame', 'guy', 'really', 'rest', 'band', 'mate', 'certainly', 'seemed', 'have', 'stage', 'pretty', 'well', 'covered', 'especially', 'Townshend', 'jumping/hopping', 'stage', 'repeatedly.The', 'Who', 'Kilburn', 'fascinating', 'film', 'largely', 'even', 'film', 'was', 'filmed', '35mm', 'film', 'rather', 'unusual', 'concert', 'footage', 'Thankfully', 'medium', 'well', 'providing', 'master', 'encoding', 'high', 'def', 'media', 'thanks', 'product', 'viewers', 'get', 'Blu-ray', 'least', 'point', 'technologically', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'achieved', 'optical', 'disc', 'media.Note', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'NOT', 'RATED', 'were', 'rated', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'R', 'rating', 'utterances', 'f-bomb', 'several', 'points', 'course', 'show.Most', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'item', 'serious', 'Who', 'fans', 'should', 'add', 'collection']",N/A
1183413,AVUKI21HQW68U,B001DWNUF6,"T. Korol ""music lover""","[8, 9]","Kilburn is a good show. But as previously noted it is a little sloppy, and Pete needs to be much further up in the mix. I don't mind sloppy, hey it's rock and roll. But the boys sound a little lethargic. (Especially when compared to the 69 show.) Pete is jumping around and dancing and windmilling like a madman, but the musical energy to back up the antics is just not there for good portions of the show.  Keith is fine, but he does a lot of mugging for the camera, and I think his playing at the 69 show is far superior to Kilburn. I'm sure a lot of fans will disagree, but I am just not as amped up about this show as other reviews.The Coliseum show from 1969 is another matter. The sound mix is worse than Kilburn but the band sounds better! Pete does less dancing but much more *playing*; there is more technique and more leads -and just awesome jaw dropping moments (sparks, my generation especially fiery).  He is all over the fretboard and his use of feedback and distortion masterful.  Keith, for me, is far better than the Kilburn show. He does less pandering and just plays the hell out of every song. Roger is fine at both shows; but I guess I am just on old fogey - something about him in that fringed vest is Roger, and he seems looser at the Coliseum show. Ox is Ox, beyond great at both shows; was there ever a better bass player?Tommy, as others mention, is included as bonus material (with A Quick One).  I would have liked it in sequence of the show, but at least it is here. They are both great, but I will always have a special love for Tommy and watching it here shows the power and energy of a live Who show. I mean they just kill it start to finish without a breath or break.I believe a lot of it is the history. In the late 60's and even early 70's bands like the Who, Zeppelin, Floyd were very vital. By the late 70's they had lost a lot of that vitality. They could still crank out the great studio album at times, but by and large the magic was gone. They had become bloated money machines. Not bad bands by any means; just a shadow of their former selves. By 1977, The Ramones, NY Dolls, and countless others were taking up the charge to do something refreshing, edgy. The two Who shows here demonstrate the difference in 60's rock giants who 10 years later lost an edge or two. They were too aware of who/what they were instead of just being/living it.Any Who fan is going to buy this and it seems I am in a minority in being lukewarm over the Kilburn show.  I would pay twice the price of this set for the Coliseum show alone, it is that good. Then throw in a good not great performance from 77 and you can't go wrong!

As a musician who has participated in a few reunion gigs, there's no landscape filled with more landmines than trying to play a perfect set after you've been out of the saddle for a few months.  And yet here are the Who, an establishment band (much to Pete's horror) trying to maintain their self-respect in front of the cameras and posterity in spite of all the rust of a year's hiatus.  What you get on this video is the Who on a bad night, which is better than 99% of most other band's good nights.  Pete is trying extra hard, in spite of his barely contained rage at being stuck in an anachronism of a band, as punk, techno, and disco are washing away the last vestiges of the 60's. The mix is bass-heavy, which is ok considering how much John Entwistle battled Roger for low man on the totem pole in the Who universe.  However, Pete's guitar is perfectly audible, despite some complaints about the balance of the mix.  The rumors of Keith Moon's decline by this point are exaggerated, although he appears winded at times, as does Pete.  What part of more than a decade's hard living don't you understand?  Keith's playing is exquisite because it is so late in the game for him, and he plays magnificently throughout the concert.  He's not flawless, but I can't imagine any drummer who would dare try to step into his shoes.  The joy of this video is that it shows the glances, grins, and nods between the musicians, sometimes annoyed puzzlement at missed cues (mostly Pete), other times outright laughter that they can bash away for the cameras and not care if they screw up.  They are professional grade, but they're still a bunch of geezers from Shepard's Bush, having a good time.  Look for an early version of ""Who Are You"", the rare ""Dreaming from the Waist"", and spirited and sincere renditions of their earlier glory (a great ""My Generation"").  How this concert sat on the shelf for so long simply indicates Pete's streak of perfectionism and respect for the band and the fans.  If you have not seen this concert in its entirety you are the poorer for it.
