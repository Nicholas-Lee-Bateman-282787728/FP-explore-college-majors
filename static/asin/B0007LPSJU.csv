Since that awful day in Dallas, I have read uncountable books about the Kennedy era, as well as biographies about John and Jacqueline Kennedy, and watched the many film clips of them which now live in cyberspace.  While she's much younger than I and wouldn't remember Jackie in her White House years, Jill Hennessey obviously did her homework, because she superbly manifests the spirit, intelligence, dignity and mannerisms of Camelot's first lady.  Jill and the actresses who portray Ethel and Joan have done a fine job of depicting these historical characters and their relationships in a time slipping farther and farther into history.

882327,A2CZO3D5JCL4PJ,B0007LPSJU,"Charles E. Mitchell ""Charles7""","[4, 5]","The screenplay to this production was written by someone wishing to portray the Kennedy women as strong & independent in their own rights. Given the recent releases of some of her old interviews in which Jackie stated that her opinions were pretty much given to her by JFK, and the shock expressed by Caroline's daughters in learning that their grandmother was the antithesis of a liberated woman, it is difficult to make that case with Jackie. Recalling Joan's bouts with alcoholism as a result of her marriage to Ted the words strong & independent do not fit so well. Perhaps Ethel was the exception, but I suspect she was very much the traditional housewife. With Joan, who was not so strong, & Jackie, who was anything but independent, we are being asked to empathize with people who were privileged and wealthy, and somehow relate to their stories.

Jill Hennessry is very believable as Jackie Kennedy and when the President dies - her scenes will break your heart and take you right back to that dreadful moment in time.  Lauren Holly is excellent as Ethel and fun to watch - Leslie Stefanson is surprisingly effective as Joan Kennedy,you can find yourself cheering for her and that surprised me.  This movie is about these three remarkable women and that theme is carried out from the beginning to the end of the film.

I thought Jill Hennesey was very good as Jackie and the role of Joan was very well played, very believable. I didn't care for this interpretation of Ethel. Just grated on the nerves. If she was that irritating a personality then I can't imagine her fitting in with the Kennedys or keeping Bobby's interest very long.  The portrayal of Bobby was well done and he looks quite a bit like him. More so than the actor in the latest Kennedy film with Greg Kinnear as JFK. The actor playing JFK was a fairly close match but he really lacks the skill as an actor to carry the role. This movie really does take you behind the scenes of their public lives and it's an interesting look.
