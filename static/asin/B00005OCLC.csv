672512,AJ7FQ781NUY68,B00005OCLC,artist-cat,"[0, 10]","Sorry to those who loved this DVD - guess it did nothing for me.To put it in context - I saw them live in 1979 (was centre of row 5 from the stage too) shortly after the worldwide release of ""Live At Budokhan"".  So that concert is forever burned into my brain and so I guess seeing this DVD ruined that memory of just how good they can be.Guess I was expecting an ""At Budokhan"" like performance (and song list) with modern sound (DTS and the like), but got neither.Look if you want a collection of all the songs CT have done over the last 30 years this is pretty good (and if you view it in that context maybe I'd give it 3 stars).  But if you want to see them like they were in their heyday doing stuff from their first 4 albums - you'll be disappointed.I still like cheap trick alot (I share a birthday with Robin Zander so there's nothing wrong with that) - but they don't recyle as well 30 years later as say, the Eagles, did (at least before they did the dirty and kicked Felder out of the band - now I dislike their new stuff intensly)...Anyway, back to CT (IN POSTSCRIPT) - the 1978 ""At Budokhan"" DVD is FINALLY released.  If you like CT you have to get that - it's magic, just as I remember them all those years ago back in the 70s.",2,Disappointed - but still like the band all the same,1173398400,"03 9, 2007",2007,1240,"['Sorry', 'who', 'loved', 'DVD', 'guess', 'did', 'nothing', 'me.To', 'put', 'context', 'saw', 'live', '1979', 'was', 'centre', 'row', '5', 'stage', 'too', 'shortly', 'worldwide', 'release', 'Live', 'Budokhan', 'concert', 'forever', 'burned', 'brain', 'so', 'guess', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'ruined', 'memory', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'can', 'be.Guess', 'was', 'expecting', 'Budokhan', 'performance', 'song', 'list', 'modern', 'sound', 'DTS', 'like', 'got', 'neither.Look', 'want', 'collection', 'songs', 'CT', 'have', 'done', 'last', '30', 'years', 'pretty', 'good', 'view', 'context', 'maybe', ""'d"", 'give', '3', 'stars', 'want', 'see', 'were', 'heyday', 'doing', 'stuff', 'first', '4', 'albums', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed.I', 'still', 'cheap', 'trick', 'alot', 'share', 'birthday', 'Robin', 'Zander', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'recyle', 'as', 'well', '30', 'years', 'later', 'say', 'Eagles', 'did', 'least', 'did', 'dirty', 'kicked', 'Felder', 'band', 'now', 'dislike', 'new', 'stuff', 'intensly', 'Anyway', 'back', 'CT', 'IN', 'POSTSCRIPT', '1978', 'Budokhan', 'DVD', 'FINALLY', 'released', 'like', 'CT', 'have', 'get', 'magic', 'just', 'remember', 'years', 'ago', 'back', '70s']",N/A

672514,AY12DBB0U420B,B00005OCLC,Gary Peterson,"[2, 2]","Cheap Trick has long been one of my favorite bands since the late 70s. I first purchased ""Dream Police,"" loved it, and followed up with ""Live at Budokan."" Both were excellent recordings. Lately, I picked up the ""Silver"" and ""St. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" DVDs.The ""Silver'"" DVD by Cheap Trick is a celebration of the 25th year of the band at a live concert in Rockford, Illinois. The setting is somewhat crude, the sound is so-so and the video could be better. It doesn't matter. The video picks up the real essence of a live concert and it's a wonderful viewing experience, especially for Cheap Trick fans. Cheap Trick are obviously up for the evening and put on a stellar performance before an entranced audience. It's a long concert. Cheap Trick go through 30 selections over a 135 minute period. Inasmuch as the DVD has the breaks cut out, the concert itself must have been over three hours and must have been under sweltering conditions, judging from the band and the audience appearances. A plethora of guest appearances, including Cheap Trick offspring, heightened the concert. One of the highlights was a guitar dual between Slash of Guns n' Roses and Cheap Trick's Rick Neilsen. Outstanding, and fun to watch.I'd say the best part of the video was the first third, then it lagged somewhat and I was thinking about four stars, then came a rousing rendition of Surrender as a finale. Of course, the audience demanded an encore and Cheap Trick complied with three more songs and one of the best parts of the concert. Excellent viewing.

672515,A37FUJC2L7DSPT,B00005OCLC,"J. L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[0, 0]","Leave it to Cheap Trick to perform their August 28, 1999, 25th anniversary concert in the group's Rockford, Illinois, hometown.  Was there ever a rock band less worried about its image, its lead guitarist dressed as though he's auditioning for a REVENGE OF THE NERDS film and its drummer who would have us believe his name is Bunezuela?  No, Cheap Trick does not go for the glamor.  I'm sure it was suggested they put on such a show in New York City or Los Angeles, but Cheap Trick saves it for the folks back home.And in SILVER, the D.V.D. of that 1999 performance, Cheap Trick makes Rockford almost as much a participant as audience, having guest musicians from the local orchestra and the band's families joining in on different songs.  There is not a dull moment in SILVER and as impressive as any visitor to the stage are members of Smashing Pumpkins, Everclear, and Guns N' Roses dropping in to play.  Remember, this is Rockford, Illinois, not New York City.  Is it convenient for Slash or Billy Corgan to come to Rockford?  Probably not, yet for Cheap Trick, they take the trouble.  Art is personal, but when a band gets fellow musicians of that caliber to go out of their way to pay tribute to them, that's got to be a rockin' good band.Several reviews mention that SILVER's lighting and camera work could at times be better.  I don't know if Cheap Trick planned it that way, but I think some of the off images make for a home movie effect, and the band is performing at home.That Cheap Trick still attracts enough attention to sell both records and concert seats today speaks for the group's enduring talent. As I write this in 2012 they are still out there even though drummer Bun E. Carlos no longer tours, restricting his work to recording C.D.s with the band. Besides Cheap Trick, how many musical acts that broke in the mid-1970s are still making new music, touring, and comprise the original members? Tom Petersson was away for seven or so years but Carlos, guitarist Rick Nielsen and vocalist Robin Zander were always there, so it's not as if they went through a bunch of personnel changes only to finally reunite after years apart.Long live the music of Cheap Trick.

But this outdoor show was very poorly lit, and the DVD suffers because of it.  That kind of stage lighting probably works okay in an enclosed room, but in the open night air the visible light gets sucked into the darkness.  You can see the light rigging in the video, and it looks, well, awkwardly arranged at best.  Not enough light (especially white light) on the stage and the band.  Robin Zander may not have minded so much, however.  He is looking a bit weatherbeaten in this show.Still a good concert, but disappointing visual presentation.  But that isn't the fault of the camera work or the DVD makers.  The fault lies with whoever designed the stage lighting.",4,Great show! Great band!

I don't think it's fair to score this DVD by separating each part and grading individually by sound, picture, etc. I will do so, but I want to make it clear first that this concert DVD experience taken as a whole is just awesome. If you grew up listening to this group on the radio, you owe it to yourself to see them live. As a former non-fan of Cheap Trick, I had never seen them live before, or owned any of their albums. Seeing this DVD however, I realize that I missed out on one of the world's best live acts. They are tight, energetic, and fun to watch, even after all these years. They are in fine form here.Now for the grading of the separate parts:*Sound quality: 5 stars. It's not studio-quality, but for a live recording, it is top-notch.*Video quality: 4 stars. I've seen better, but there again, for a live show, it's pretty good. I've also seen a LOT worse elsewhere. I'd read that the picture quality was awful, but it is definitely not awful. In fact it is quite good I think. Just my opinion; your mileage may vary.*Performance: 5 stars. Excellent. These guys are just a total blast to watch. I can find no fault here.I have not been a fan of this band until just today when I watched this, so I think you can trust my opinion as unbiased. All the hits are here, and more, with lots of special guests. The special guests were unfamiliar to me, but all did a fine job on their parts too. Don't dismiss this band out of hand, as I did, as just another hit machine. They are a talented bunch, and deserve a listen from you.

However, the band sounds terrific and what a set-list their is!Just about all the hits are played (""I Want You To WAnt Me,"" ""Surrender,"" ""Dream Police,"" ""She's Tight,"" etc), as well as some rarities and a few fun covers thrown in.Their are guest appearances by Art Alexakis of Everclear, Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, and Jon Brandt, who was CT's bass player in the mid-80's.More impressive, though, are the guest appreances of the children or Robin Zander and Rick Nielson, who join the band for a set.  Of particular interest is the apperance of Zander's daughter who beautifully sings vocals with her father on his solo track ""Time Will Let You Know.""  This is a major moment in the concert!If you can get past the mediocre, at best, picture quality, then there is much to enjoy here.  The band sounds tight, intense, and terrific! More importantly, their love of playing together is quite obvious here.  Not many bands have this good of chemistry after a quarter-century together!",4,A Close to Perfect Live Document of a Great Band,1041465600,"01 2, 2003",2003,1610,"['surface', 'DVD', 'would', 'seem', 'ideal', 'testament', 'Cheap', 'Trick', 'longevity', 'diversity', 'couple', 'flaws', 'aside', 'indeed', 'close', 'ideal', 'Filmed', 'hometown', 'Rockford', 'IL', 'summer', '1999', 'concert', 'was', 'special', 'occasion', 'marking', '25th', 'anniversary', 'band.CT', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'finest', 'most', 'underrated', 'American', 'bands', 'music', 'timeless', 'impossible', 'pigeonhole', 'one', 'genre', 'have', 'influenced', 'so', 'many', 'others.Sadly', 'picutre', 'quality', 'DVD', 'far', 'ideal', 'Too', 'often', 'grainy', 'fuzzy', 'ligthing', 'be', 'too', 'fleshed', 'out', 'However', 'band', 'terrific', 'what', 'set-list', 'Just', 'hits', 'are', 'played', 'Want', 'WAnt', 'Me', 'Surrender', 'Dream', 'Police', 'Tight', 'etc', 'as', 'well', 'rarities', 'few', 'fun', 'thrown', 'in.Their', 'are', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Art', 'Alexakis', 'Everclear', 'Billy', 'Corgan', 'Smashing', 'Pumpkins', 'Jon', 'Brandt', 'who', 'was', 'CT', 'bass', 'player', ""mid-80's.More"", 'impressive', 'are', 'guest', 'appreances', 'children', 'Robin', 'Zander', 'Rick', 'Nielson', 'who', 'join', 'band', 'set', 'particular', 'interest', 'apperance', 'Zander', 'daughter', 'who', 'beautifully', 'vocals', 'father', 'solo', 'track', 'Time', 'Will', 'Let', 'Know', 'major', 'moment', 'concert', 'can', 'get', 'mediocre', 'best', 'picture', 'quality', 'then', 'much', 'enjoy', 'here', 'band', 'tight', 'intense', 'terrific', 'More', 'importantly', 'love', 'playing', 'together', 'quite', 'obvious', 'here', 'Not', 'many', 'bands', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'quarter-century', 'together']",N/A

McCall ""ncwolf1""","[12, 13]","Cheap Trick is probably my second favorite band of all time & I've seen them live about nine times through the years so I'm a little biased from the start.  I bought this from their website after seeing the DirectTV free version of this show.  That version has nine extra songs on it plus the other version as well (two dvds) & I couldn't be more thrilled with this.  They are still as great as they were when they started & to have the original lineup after all these years says something as well.  Absolutely untouchable set which would've been even better without that jerk from Everclear ruining ""Daytripper"".  But it's nice to see other musicians paying their respects to these guys.  It's nice to see them get recognition from their peers that unfortunately continues to go unobtained from the public.  This band has always been innovative and imaginative in its approach.  Most of their records are quite different taken one by one and I just hope they have a new one out soon as promised.  It's been five years now & the last one was just excellent!!  This would be an excellent place to start if you've never experienced the magic that is Cheap Trick!!

Guest stars abound along with a host of other musicians add to the celebration and the crowd was indeed rabid. All the songs are represented here that CT fans expect and are delivered with verve. All band members are represented here, and even former bassist Jon Brandt joins in for his album cuts. The DVD offers up a nice selection of extras including Rick Nielson hamming it up for the camera off stage (and on stage of course). Cheap Trick wails and all is right in the world. Now for the negatives from this release. Sound is just okay, after some heavy EQ work I was able to get a very good sound from my Sony 5.1 system, but camera work is indeed lacking. Cameras used for long shots had badly overexposed pictures much of the time and many of the handheld shots were in wrong position, but that may have been an editing problem. All in all I give the performance 5-stars and production 3 stars (a very generous 3-stars).",4,Comprehensive,1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,1033,"['boys', 'take', 'stage', 'hometown', 'silver', 'anniversary', 'concert', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'Guest', 'host', 'other', 'musicians', 'add', 'celebration', 'crowd', 'was', 'indeed', 'rabid', 'songs', 'are', 'represented', 'here', 'CT', 'fans', 'expect', 'are', 'delivered', 'verve', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'represented', 'here', 'even', 'former', 'bassist', 'Jon', 'Brandt', 'album', 'cuts', 'DVD', 'up', 'nice', 'selection', 'extras', 'including', 'Rick', 'Nielson', 'hamming', 'up', 'camera', 'off', 'stage', 'stage', 'course', 'Cheap', 'Trick', 'wails', 'right', 'world', 'Now', 'negatives', 'release', 'Sound', 'just', 'okay', 'heavy', 'EQ', 'work', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'Sony', '5.1', 'system', 'camera', 'work', 'indeed', 'lacking', 'Cameras', 'used', 'long', 'shots', 'had', 'badly', 'overexposed', 'pictures', 'much', 'time', 'many', 'handheld', 'shots', 'were', 'wrong', 'position', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'editing', 'problem', 'give', 'performance', '5-stars', 'production', '3', 'stars', 'very', 'generous', '3-stars']",N/A

When I saw that they were coming out with this 25th anniversary concert on CD and DVD as well, I opted for the DVD (I have just recently purchased the double CD). I fail to see where the audio is of poor quality. The acoustic performances in the middle of the set sound just this side of perfect, and the electric stuff sounded, to these ears, clearer than I have ever heard. The video quality didn't bother me in the least, in fact, I thought the whole thing was well produced in general. It's to the band's credit that they offered and delivered a song from every album over the years, and they still sound as good as they ever have. Their musicianship is hands down some of the finest out there; you just don't do what Rick Neilsen and Tom Petersson manage to do night after night without possessing some amazing musical ability, and Robin Zander has one of the most powerful voices to come down the pike in years (and comes eerily close to John Lennon territory on some of the material), and Bun E. Carlos packs an amazing punch on the drums (kudos to the drum choir at the end for its sheer craziness). The commentary gives some very cool insight (I noticed nothing was said about ""The Flame"", widely known as not one of Rick's favorite songs but a huge hit nonetheless) and the behind-the-scenes stuff is just off the wall! I didn't find anything poor about the quality of this show at all...if someone is expecting ""The Wall"", they're looking in the wrng place. This collection brings across the true spirit of a band rock and roll is a lot better off for having experienced, and they're still at it. The preview tracks from their June 2006 release ""Rockford"" on their website are nothing less than I expected from one of the best bands, then and now.",5,Poor quality?
