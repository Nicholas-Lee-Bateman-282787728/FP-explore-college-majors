And it is definitely not the best of the series.  This is from the very beginning of the series, not pics from throughout the series.  Later in the series (not on this DVD)  Bobbie Jo and Billy Jo are new actresses, they are no where to be found on this DVD package.  Big Disappointment!

I bought this set on Black Friday at Target, because this is one of my favorite classic sitcoms, and there was only one copy on the shelf.  When I got home to watch it, I heard the replacement theme, and it was terrible.  They replaced the classic, memorable theme with a song called ""The Train That Carried My Girl From Town"", which is a real song, but the cover they used is terrible, and doesn't fit the show.The opening and closing theme are replaced with this song, and any time the song is used in the show, itself, it's covered up by that song.  It's a bit annoying to hear it every 5 minutes.  Maybe three stars is too much for this set.  But, for 16 episodes, at $5.00, (now on sale at Target for $4.75), I suppose it's worth it.One day, I'll save up enough money to buy the official season sets, which have the original theme music, and include all kinds of special features!Since posting this review, I now own the Official First Season, which I found at Big Lots, on Black Friday, for only $6.00!",3,Some Good Episodes.

Hence, they can release the video, which is no longer copywrited (may have lapsed for whatever reason), but they cannot release a recording of the theme song, which is probably still under copywrite.Thus, they dubbed over the theme song and relesed a cheap-o version of the video.You fans of this show will just have to wait for a decent release.",1,Maybe Whiy The Theme Song's Been Excised,1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,747,"['was', 'not', 'fan', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'buy', 'disk', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'stumbled', 'page', 'started', 'reading', 'reviews', 'always', 'read', 'bad', 'reviews.The', 'reason', 'theme', 'song', 'was', 'replaced', 'might', 'be', 'company', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'obviously', 'hack', 'outfit', 'program', 'may', 'be', 'public', 'domain', 'theme', 'song', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Hence', 'can', 'release', 'video', 'longer', 'copywrited', 'may', 'have', 'lapsed', 'reason', 'can', 'not', 'release', 'recording', 'theme', 'song', 'probably', 'still', 'copywrite.Thus', 'dubbed', 'theme', 'song', 'relesed', 'cheap-o', 'version', 'video.You', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'wait', 'decent', 'release']",Petticoat Junction
