1384735,A27Q80GZDFZ92K,B00443FMHK,Amateur Stargazer,"[9, 9]","This is one of the best and one of the saddest elephant documentaries. It is about the passing of Echo and how it affected the other elephants of the herd. The program is only an hour long, but the content is so good that after watching it you feel that you have had a worthwhile experience with elephants.  The blu-ray disc shows with much clarity the majestic scenery of the national park with Mount Kilimanjaro rising in the background.  Cynthia Moss relates the stories of her long experience with elephants, and she probably knows them better than anyone else. You can sympathize with her and the others who worked with Echo when they have lost the elephant after knowing her for so many years. Elephants are sensitive, intelligent animals, much like the humans who care for them.If you own the previous documentaries of Nature or the BBC about Echo and her elephant family you will want to add this one to your collection. Perhaps another episode featuring elephants and/or African wildlife should have been added to what is offered here, since many of the other Nature DVD's/blu-rays contain bonus programs to make them at least two hours. It's the one thing that would have made this outstanding blu-ray/DVD even better.  The program has such beautiful footage photographed with the latest technology that it makes you wish for more.",4,In memory of an elephant,1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,1341,"['one', 'best', 'one', 'saddest', 'elephant', 'documentaries', 'passing', 'Echo', 'how', 'affected', 'other', 'elephants', 'herd', 'program', 'only', 'hour', 'long', 'content', 'so', 'good', 'watching', 'feel', 'have', 'had', 'worthwhile', 'experience', 'elephants', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'much', 'clarity', 'majestic', 'scenery', 'national', 'park', 'Mount', 'Kilimanjaro', 'rising', 'background', 'Cynthia', 'Moss', 'stories', 'long', 'experience', 'elephants', 'probably', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'can', 'sympathize', 'others', 'who', 'worked', 'Echo', 'when', 'have', 'lost', 'elephant', 'knowing', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'Elephants', 'are', 'sensitive', 'intelligent', 'animals', 'much', 'humans', 'who', 'care', 'them.If', 'own', 'previous', 'documentaries', 'Nature', 'BBC', 'Echo', 'elephant', 'family', 'will', 'want', 'add', 'one', 'collection', 'Perhaps', 'episode', 'featuring', 'elephants', 'and/or', 'African', 'wildlife', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'what', 'offered', 'here', 'many', 'other', 'Nature', ""DVD's/blu-rays"", 'contain', 'bonus', 'programs', 'make', 'least', 'two', 'hours', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'outstanding', 'blu-ray/DVD', 'even', 'better', 'program', 'such', 'beautiful', 'footage', 'photographed', 'latest', 'technology', 'wish', 'more']",N/A
1384736,A672SQEY05LPN,B00443FMHK,Buddy Love,"[6, 6]","Echo is an elephant matriarch who was studied by Cynthia Moss for over 28 years. Echo led her family through many droughts, and through many tough times. Her family was close-nit, and they depended on each other for survival. I have followed the story of Echo the elephant, ever since she has been followed in the 1990's. I remember the documentary they had following the birth of her son Eli. Her son was crippled for the first 3 days of his life. He walked around on his knees until they turned raw, because he could not stand up straight like the other normal baby elephants.Even though his strength was fading, one day he finally gathered up the strength to stand up straight. Eli finally got his first chance to nurse from his mother. After he got his first meal, his strength improved and he became stronger every day thereafter. Echo went on to have other babies after that, and the documentaries about her slowed down. Echo's daughter's remained with her over the years, and they also helped her look out for the young elephant calves.This movie is more about the final demise of Echo, It is very interesting, and I enjoyed it so much. Echo was a very intelligent thinking elephant that was devoted to her family until the very end of her life. I like elephants even more than lions, but the good films about them are harder to find.",5,Review Of Echo The Elephant!,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,1341,"['Echo', 'elephant', 'matriarch', 'who', 'was', 'studied', 'Cynthia', 'Moss', '28', 'years', 'Echo', 'led', 'family', 'many', 'droughts', 'many', 'tough', 'times', 'family', 'was', 'close-nit', 'depended', 'other', 'survival', 'have', 'followed', 'story', 'Echo', 'elephant', 'ever', 'been', 'followed', '1990', 'remember', 'documentary', 'had', 'following', 'birth', 'son', 'Eli', 'son', 'was', 'crippled', 'first', '3', 'days', 'life', 'walked', 'around', 'knees', 'turned', 'raw', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'straight', 'other', 'normal', 'baby', 'elephants.Even', 'strength', 'was', 'fading', 'one', 'day', 'finally', 'gathered', 'up', 'strength', 'stand', 'up', 'straight', 'Eli', 'finally', 'got', 'first', 'chance', 'nurse', 'mother', 'got', 'first', 'meal', 'strength', 'improved', 'became', 'stronger', 'day', 'thereafter', 'Echo', 'went', 'have', 'other', 'babies', 'documentaries', 'slowed', 'down', 'Echo', 'daughter', 'remained', 'years', 'also', 'helped', 'look', 'out', 'young', 'elephant', 'calves.This', 'movie', 'more', 'final', 'demise', 'Echo', 'very', 'interesting', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'Echo', 'was', 'very', 'intelligent', 'thinking', 'elephant', 'was', 'devoted', 'family', 'very', 'end', 'life', 'like', 'elephants', 'even', 'more', 'lions', 'good', 'films', 'are', 'harder', 'find']",N/A

When this episode finally aired, I felt like I had lost a friend as well. The documentary is one of the most moving and fascinating ones of the animal kingdom.""Echo: An Elephant to Remember,"" had me in tears most of the episode, but clapping at the end. For we learn just how deep elephants are. Echo taught her family well, and she will live on through them. I hope the story doesn't end, for I would love to learn more about spunky Ebony, or see how well Echo's sister does in continuing to lead the family.It is sad to see such a magnificent creature go, but the story is one that cannot be missed. There is just too much to learn from it.Aside from the story, the photography is amazing. I never tire of seeing these awesome creatures dominate the plains, or watch them interact with each other.
