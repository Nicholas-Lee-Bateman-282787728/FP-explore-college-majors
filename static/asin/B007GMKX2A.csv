If you're a Giants fan, no matter whether or not you record the games yourself and no matter if they are at SD or HD resolution, it's DEFINITELY worth getting this set.  The video quality of this blu ray is exactly like the original broadcast, only without advertisements.  All of the replays and commentary in between plays are here.Unfortunately, as with all other NFL Films game releases, they have included no pregame, halftime or postgame.  This is partially the reason I gave it only 4 stars.  But I have those on my DVD recordings, so it's not a huge loss for me.  My other gripe is that the audio is NOT 5.1 Dolby Digital.  REALLY, NFL Films?  The game was broadcast in 5.1, how hard would it be to include that audio track?Anyway, back to the positives.  This set is a great set to have when you want to watch the game and only the game.  You can watch all 4 games in a very manageable 8.5 hours.  Even if you capture games in HD quality, it's nice to have a backup in case your media ever fails.  And not to mention the fact that you can watch the games with no ads and you don't have to edit them out yourself.I highly recommend this set.",4,A must have for EVERY Giants fan,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,1177,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', ""'re"", 'Giants', 'fan', 'matter', 'not', 'record', 'games', 'matter', 'are', 'SD', 'HD', 'resolution', 'DEFINITELY', 'getting', 'set', 'video', 'quality', 'blu', 'ray', 'exactly', 'original', 'broadcast', 'only', 'advertisements', 'replays', 'commentary', 'plays', 'are', 'here.Unfortunately', 'other', 'NFL', 'Films', 'game', 'releases', 'have', 'included', 'pregame', 'halftime', 'postgame', 'partially', 'reason', 'gave', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'have', 'DVD', 'recordings', 'not', 'huge', 'loss', 'other', 'gripe', 'audio', 'NOT', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'REALLY', 'NFL', 'Films', 'game', 'was', 'broadcast', '5.1', 'how', 'hard', 'would', 'be', 'include', 'audio', 'track', 'Anyway', 'back', 'positives', 'set', 'great', 'set', 'have', 'when', 'want', 'watch', 'game', 'only', 'game', 'can', 'watch', '4', 'games', 'very', 'manageable', '8.5', 'hours', 'Even', 'capture', 'games', 'HD', 'quality', 'nice', 'have', 'backup', 'case', 'media', 'ever', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'can', 'watch', 'games', 'ads', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'edit', 'out', 'yourself.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set']",The New York Giants: Road to XLVI

Wins do not come easy for the Giants, they claw and scratch their way to win this Superbowl. Each game is frustrating, knowing they win each game makes it easier to watch.Presentation:Menus are slick, similar to a video game, after a quick disclaimer informing you that the producers of the set tried their best to compile all game footage, you are off to go.2 games per disc, each game can be watched fully, or you can skip to the top highlights each game has to offer.The Superbowl features a bonus stats track, that pops up with tidbits throughout.The only flaw, is that their is no Superbowl celebration footage, which is a letdown.Video QualityFor the playoff games, Fox gives you HD @720p, this is a bit better than the broadcasts but not by much.If I remember the Superbowl was broadcast on NBC, and the quality does skip up bit.",4,Giants Fans Rejoice.,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,898,"['Watching', 'being', 'fan', 'New', 'York', 'Giants', 'difficult', 'Wins', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'easy', 'Giants', 'claw', 'scratch', 'way', 'win', 'Superbowl', 'game', 'frustrating', 'knowing', 'win', 'game', 'easier', 'watch.Presentation', 'Menus', 'are', 'slick', 'similar', 'video', 'game', 'quick', 'disclaimer', 'informing', 'producers', 'set', 'tried', 'best', 'compile', 'game', 'footage', 'are', 'go.2', 'games', 'disc', 'game', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'fully', 'can', 'skip', 'top', 'highlights', 'game', 'offer.The', 'Superbowl', 'bonus', 'track', 'up', 'tidbits', 'throughout.The', 'only', 'flaw', 'Superbowl', 'celebration', 'footage', 'letdown.Video', 'QualityFor', 'playoff', 'games', 'Fox', 'HD', '@', '720p', 'bit', 'better', 'broadcasts', 'not', 'much.If', 'remember', 'Superbowl', 'was', 'broadcast', 'NBC', 'quality', 'skip', 'up', 'bit']",The New York Giants: Road to XLVI

However, having this set only contain the playoff games is an EPIC FAIL! The Giants had to win the last two games of the season. This run began with the 99 yard catch and run by Victor Cruz against the Jets. Then a do or die sunday night match up against the cowboys for the NFC East title. How both of those games are not included in this set is ridiculous.

It contains the 3 Giants' Playoff Game wins, and of course Super Bowl XLVI. The games are the complete network broadcasts.
