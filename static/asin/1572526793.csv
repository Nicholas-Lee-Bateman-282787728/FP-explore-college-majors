This movie does have brutal scenes of abuse with a belt on a child, sexual touching, and a rape scene. Also child drinking of moonshine. So, I would say this is not a movie for children. I actually watched this on tv with my mom and after the movie we talked about all that had happened. But overall, this is a pretty good movie about how our family life can be a good indicator of how our life would probably turn out.",5,Hard Truths,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,540,"['movie', 'great', 'hard', 'truths', 'child', 'abuse', 'being', 'called', '34', 'bastard', '34', 'mid', '1900', 'movie', 'have', 'brutal', 'scenes', 'abuse', 'belt', 'child', 'sexual', 'touching', 'rape', 'scene', 'Also', 'child', 'drinking', 'moonshine', 'So', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'movie', 'children', 'actually', 'watched', 'tv', 'mom', 'movie', 'talked', 'had', 'happened', 'overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'how', 'family', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'indicator', 'how', 'life', 'would', 'probably', 'turn', 'out']",N/A

I have to be in a certain mindset to make the decision to watch a movie that revolves around a brutal subject - even if it has recieved rave reviews. This film deals with extremely sensitive subject matter and I had to turn away more than once while watching it. Being exposed to the horrors that other people have endured is gut-wrenching, and when it's played out in disturbingly graphic detail it can almost be too much to bear. But I also think it's an important reminder to feel empathy for others and pay attention to what is going on around you. People live in abuse situations and they feel powerless against it, but sometimes it can be stopped if someone steps in before it's too late. No one should be treated like an insignificant object and those who fall victim to warped, narrcistic and self-serving individuals are subjected to one of the lowest forms of slavery and inhumanity.",5,"Difficult to watch, but don't miss it",1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,957,"['Anjelica', 'Huston', 'did', 'incredible', 'job', 'directorial', 'debut', 'have', 'be', 'certain', 'mindset', 'make', 'decision', 'watch', 'movie', 'brutal', 'subject', 'even', 'recieved', 'rave', 'reviews', 'film', 'deals', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'matter', 'had', 'turn', 'away', 'more', 'once', 'watching', 'Being', 'exposed', 'horrors', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'endured', 'gut-wrenching', 'when', 'played', 'out', 'disturbingly', 'graphic', 'detail', 'can', 'almost', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'bear', 'also', 'think', 'important', 'reminder', 'feel', 'empathy', 'others', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'going', 'People', 'live', 'abuse', 'situations', 'feel', 'powerless', 'can', 'be', 'stopped', 'someone', 'steps', 'too', 'late', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'treated', 'insignificant', 'object', 'who', 'fall', 'victim', 'warped', 'narrcistic', 'self-serving', 'individuals', 'are', 'subjected', 'one', 'lowest', 'forms', 'slavery', 'inhumanity']",N/A
187883,A1OMEH970G0Q7Q,1572526793,Adrian A. Shelton,"[10, 10]","This is an example of great filmmaking (way to go, Angelica Huston!) I'm surprised it did not get nominated for any Academy Awards, because it certainly had outstanding acting performances against the backdrop of an  equally remarkable storyline. It is a very good story, but also quite  disturbing and definitely will remain in one's memory upon watching it. No  words in all their effectiveness could describe the grip of pain upon my  heart as I watched this story of a young girl who suffered greatly at the  sick hands of her stepfather, while her equally sick mother refused to  acknowledge that he was hurting her. This story was shocking because it was  so genuine; this stuff happens all over the world to children and was  brutally portrayed here.  Jena Malone, who I have seen in other movies such  as &quot;Stepmom&quot;, had a lot of courage to play this very difficult  child role. The stepfather also portrayed his character with such realism  that I almost believed that for one moment, he was like that in real life.  I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars because it touched me in a way I've  never felt moved by hardly any other movie I've ever seen. I recommend this  movie at least one time to anyone with the stomach to look deep down and  find the moral of the story, but it should be for the most mature audience.  Kids may have a hard time seeing this. Even though the girl went through so  much trauma, in many ways, her stepfather who abused her was once a victim.  It's hard to see both sides of the coin, but this movie like no other,  challenges one to look beyond the hurt and the pain to discover that it is  happening out there, and if one knows it is happening, they are powerful  enough to bring an end to it, because nobody should ever have to endure  such abusive behavior. Because if you look the other way, you are also an  accomplice in abusing that victim, even more than the one actually doing  it.",4,"Beautifully filmed, outstanding performances, and enraging",962409600,"07 1, 2000",2000,1936,"['example', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'way', 'go', 'Angelica', 'Huston', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'certainly', 'had', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'performances', 'backdrop', 'equally', 'remarkable', 'storyline', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'also', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'definitely', 'will', 'remain', 'one', 'memory', 'watching', 'words', 'effectiveness', 'could', 'describe', 'grip', 'pain', 'heart', 'watched', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'suffered', 'greatly', 'sick', 'hands', 'stepfather', 'equally', 'sick', 'mother', 'refused', 'acknowledge', 'was', 'hurting', 'story', 'was', 'shocking', 'was', 'so', 'genuine', 'stuff', 'world', 'children', 'was', 'brutally', 'portrayed', 'here', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'quot', 'Stepmom', 'quot', 'had', 'lot', 'courage', 'play', 'very', 'difficult', 'child', 'role', 'stepfather', 'also', 'portrayed', 'character', 'such', 'realism', 'almost', 'believed', 'one', 'moment', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'give', 'movie', '4', '5', 'stars', 'touched', 'way', ""'ve"", 'never', 'felt', 'moved', 'hardly', 'other', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'recommend', 'movie', 'least', 'one', 'time', 'anyone', 'stomach', 'look', 'deep', 'down', 'find', 'moral', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'most', 'mature', 'audience', 'Kids', 'may', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'seeing', 'Even', 'girl', 'went', 'so', 'much', 'trauma', 'many', 'ways', 'stepfather', 'who', 'abused', 'was', 'once', 'victim', 'hard', 'see', 'sides', 'coin', 'movie', 'other', 'one', 'look', 'hurt', 'pain', 'discover', 'happening', 'there', 'one', 'happening', 'are', 'powerful', 'enough', 'bring', 'end', 'nobody', 'should', 'ever', 'have', 'endure', 'such', 'abusive', 'behavior', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'are', 'also', 'accomplice', 'abusing', 'victim', 'even', 'more', 'one', 'actually', 'doing']",N/A
187884,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,1572526793,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 12]","Bastard out of Carolina is more than just a movie, it is more like a swift kick to the gut. It tells the story of a poverty level family and their constant struggle to stay on top. It is the story of a mother, a daughter, and her daughters who grow up in a world of constantly changing fathers. The main daughter that we follow through this film is Anney Boatwright (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh). After a horrible accident where Anney was thrown through the windshield of the car she was sleeping in, she goes into labor. Sleeping through all of the birth and through the next couple of days she learns that she has just given birth to her first daughter named Ruth Anne ""Bone"" Boatwright (played amazing well by Jena Malone) by a man that is no longer in her life. At the hospital she is ashamed when the stamp of ""illegitimate"" is placed on Bone's birth certificate. Anney does not want Bone, her first daughter, to have the same burden that she has had all of her life.  So, she tries to find a suitor to clear her children's less-gratifying mark.  Her men are not the best chosen, as one dies and the other begins a violent path of indiscretion and abuse that will rock all the way down to the roots of this simple family.What a powerful film this was and wasn't.  I think that this is one of those films that will last the test of time, that the message that it carries will always be relevant in our society of sexual and physical abusers.  Every day that we turn on the news, I see that there is at least one report of physical or sexual assault every day. While this is a major battle being fought in our country, this film tries to cover too many issues during one viewing.  I have read several reviews that praise this film to no end.  Speaking how it will touch us all and force us to open our eyes to the cruelties to the world. I did see this, and it was very emotional, AND I do applaud the direction of Anjelica Houston, but there were too many factions happening in this film to fully appreciate or take in the brunt force of this film.We realize what hardships are befalling Bone, wondering what she will turn out like in the future, and how her extended family will handle the facts of the issue, but we loose sight out of all of the other surroundings. This should have been a much longer film. There were some ideas that were not formulated, but yet introduced (i.e. Glen's family).  I never would have though that he came from a high society family, but what I think that Houston was trying to show here was that anyone anywhere can do these deeds of violence.I knew that there was the topic of abuse in this film, but I didn't understand enough about the family or secondary characters to truly immerse myself in this film.  I also felt that Anney's family was too stereotypical for South Carolina residents. The old mother sitting on her rocker, cranky and wrinkly, shouting words of advise to her family ... advise that everyone should have listened to ... but nobody does. How many times have we seen this in a movie? Overused and overplayed.  This needed to have crisp writing to create a story that will not only last the test of time, but not loose the message.Finally, if you are going to make a film about abuse, I would always suggest never using Lyle Lovett to have a part in the storytelling. He played a man named Wade. He had this line that made me laugh because you can image this line coming from Lyle Lovett. ""I like that man, and I don't ... I feel like he could turn wrong like a batch of whiskey in a bad barrel"".Overall, definitely a film that will last the test of time, a message about the evils of our society, but not a film to be viewed again and again.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Unfocused film tackles focused subject!,1095897600,"09 23, 2004",2004,3725,"['Bastard', 'Carolina', 'more', 'just', 'movie', 'more', 'swift', 'kick', 'gut', 'story', 'poverty', 'level', 'family', 'constant', 'struggle', 'stay', 'top', 'story', 'mother', 'daughter', 'daughters', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'world', 'constantly', 'changing', 'fathers', 'main', 'daughter', 'follow', 'film', 'Anney', 'Boatwright', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'horrible', 'accident', 'where', 'Anney', 'was', 'thrown', 'windshield', 'car', 'was', 'sleeping', 'labor', 'Sleeping', 'birth', 'next', 'couple', 'days', 'just', 'given', 'birth', 'first', 'daughter', 'named', 'Ruth', 'Anne', 'Bone', 'Boatwright', 'played', 'amazing', 'well', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'man', 'longer', 'life', 'hospital', 'ashamed', 'when', 'stamp', 'illegitimate', 'placed', 'Bone', 'birth', 'certificate', 'Anney', 'not', 'want', 'Bone', 'first', 'daughter', 'have', 'same', 'burden', 'had', 'life', 'So', 'find', 'suitor', 'clear', 'children', 'less-gratifying', 'mark', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'chosen', 'one', 'dies', 'other', 'violent', 'path', 'indiscretion', 'abuse', 'will', 'rock', 'way', 'roots', 'simple', 'powerful', 'film', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'films', 'will', 'last', 'test', 'time', 'message', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'relevant', 'society', 'sexual', 'physical', 'abusers', 'day', 'turn', 'news', 'see', 'least', 'one', 'report', 'physical', 'sexual', 'assault', 'day', 'major', 'battle', 'being', 'fought', 'country', 'film', 'cover', 'too', 'many', 'issues', 'one', 'viewing', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'reviews', 'praise', 'film', 'end', 'Speaking', 'how', 'will', 'touch', 'force', 'open', 'eyes', 'cruelties', 'world', 'did', 'see', 'was', 'very', 'emotional', 'AND', 'do', 'applaud', 'direction', 'Anjelica', 'Houston', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'factions', 'happening', 'film', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'take', 'brunt', 'force', 'film.We', 'realize', 'what', 'hardships', 'are', 'befalling', 'Bone', 'wondering', 'what', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'future', 'how', 'extended', 'family', 'will', 'handle', 'facts', 'issue', 'loose', 'sight', 'other', 'surroundings', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'longer', 'film', 'were', 'ideas', 'were', 'not', 'formulated', 'yet', 'introduced', 'i.e', 'Glen', 'family', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'came', 'high', 'society', 'family', 'what', 'think', 'Houston', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'here', 'was', 'anyone', 'anywhere', 'can', 'do', 'deeds', 'violence.I', 'knew', 'was', 'topic', 'abuse', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'enough', 'family', 'secondary', 'characters', 'truly', 'immerse', 'film', 'also', 'felt', 'Anney', 'family', 'was', 'too', 'stereotypical', 'South', 'Carolina', 'residents', 'old', 'mother', 'sitting', 'rocker', 'cranky', 'wrinkly', 'shouting', 'words', 'advise', 'family', 'advise', 'everyone', 'should', 'have', 'listened', 'nobody', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'Overused', 'overplayed', 'needed', 'have', 'crisp', 'writing', 'create', 'story', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'last', 'test', 'time', 'not', 'loose', 'message.Finally', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'film', 'abuse', 'would', 'always', 'suggest', 'never', 'using', 'Lyle', 'Lovett', 'have', 'part', 'storytelling', 'played', 'man', 'named', 'Wade', 'had', 'line', 'made', 'can', 'image', 'line', 'coming', 'Lyle', 'Lovett', 'like', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'could', 'turn', 'wrong', 'batch', 'whiskey', 'bad', 'barrel', '.Overall', 'definitely', 'film', 'will', 'last', 'test', 'time', 'message', 'evils', 'society', 'not', 'film', 'be', 'viewed', 'again', 'again.Grade', '**', '*****']",N/A

(I know it's not a children's movie).Just like my title says, the acting was good and well-done. Ron Eldard played a convincing abuser, and the depiction of the South was pretty realistic. It just saddens me how stupid Anney was and how she let Bone repeatedly get hurt just because she wanted a husband. I can't believe she even forgave him after the rape.

Glenne Headly is solid as always. Ron Eldard, who has always kind of flown under the radar fame-wise, but always well respected by critics, gives a mighty powerful performance. His character is despicable. A child-molesting, child-beating, waste of a life. This is where the difficult subject matter comes in. I won't go into detail. Just know that it's graphic and difficult. With that said, the fact that you hate Eldard's character with a hatred so deep and intense is testament to his great acting and Huston's deft direction. This was a career-making performance for the young Malone. Also look for singer Lyle Lovett and a very young Christina Ricci. Fantastic soundtrack of old-timey, Carter Family-ish country by the great Van Dyke Parks. This is a difficult to find film.

187899,A1WTYALNQNQG99,1572526793,Larry L. Looney,"[28, 29]","Anjelica Huston's directorial debut is a stunning one.  This film, based with loving care on Dorothy Allison's fine novel by screenwriter Anne Meredith, tells the story of a pre-teen girl growing up under horrific family surroundings in the 1950s American South.Bone Boatwright, played with astounding sensitivity and guts by young actor Jena Malone, is subjected to unconscionable brutality and sexual abuse by her stapfather.  Her mother, portrayed here by Jennifer Jason Leigh, is in deep denial of what is happening to her child, unable or unwilling to see what is occuring under her roof  -- partly afraid of losing her husband, partly due to psychological trauma she most likely received when she was a child.  This pattern of behavior is usually circular in nature -- victims many times become perpetrators or enablers when they become adults.  Only intensive counseling and a deep determination on the part of the survivor can break this horrible chain.Jena Malone turns in the performance of a lifetime -- and from one so young!  If she can do this level of work at this age, what will she be capable of as her career continues?  The entire cast is well-chosen -- this was a project about which they obviously cared very deeply.  The performances they give here attest to that.Meredith's screenplay is excellent -- very true to Allison's novel.  Some parts were necessarily left out for considerations of film length -- the important thing is that Meredith was intelligent and respectful enough of Allison's work that she wisely chose not to add any elements on her own.  Too many screenwriters make that mistake -- it's refreshing to see such a quality screenplay for such an important work as this.Anjelica Huston must have been extremely moved by Allison's novel (an amazing book -- check it out) to have taken on a project such as this, one that she most likely knew would not be a box office smash.  She shows great sensitivity to the material here -- there are some scenes that are necessarily brutal in nature, and they are filmed with both truth and dignity.  This is an ugly story -- thank God she chose not to show it through rose-colored glasses. The more fine films on this subject are seen, the greater our chances as a people of understanding this shameful problem in our society.  The more it is discussed and brought into the light of day, the fewer places there will remain for the perpetrators to hide.  Those who don't believe things like this still occur are fooling themselves -- statistics show that over 70% of children in America are sexually abused in some degree.  Think about that the next time you pass a school or a playground full of children, who have the right to be leading lives untouched by these predators.I've read that Ted Turner originally commissioned this film, but when it was done refused to show it on his cable network.  Too bad he lacked the courage to do the right thing -- and kudos to Showtime for stepping up to the plate and taking over.  This is an outstanding film on a heartbreaking but vital topic -- and one that should be seen by more people.

187902,A279YV5OVK6MRQ,1572526793,"RDU ""graduate school nerd""","[20, 22]","This movie is based on a semi-autobiographical novel, ""Bastard Out of Carolina,"" written by the famous feminist,lesbian author, Dorothy Allison. Analogous to the book it is based on, this film is a genuinely poignant and disquieting piece of art that was too shocking to be aired as originally planned on TNT. More importantly, the director (Anjelica Houston)does a stellar job of portraying the main events and characters in relation to the actual occurrences described in the novel. Author Dorothy Allison claims that through writing the novel ""Bastard,"" she was able to gain perspective on some of the most horrific events of her childhood.As a whole, the movie chronicles the life of an illegitimate young girl named Bone, who is born into a close-knit, yet extremely impoverished South Carolina family known as the Boatwrights. Naturally, the character Bone is meant to represent the author as she recounts various memories of her childhood.Bone's life begins well enough- -she grows up amongst a loving single mother named Anney, a younger half-sister (Reese), and many drunken, flamboyant aunts and uncles. However, Bone's life takes a turn for the worse when her mother marries a man named Glen, whom Bone is later forced to call ""Daddy Glen.""In the novel, Glen is a victim of verbal and psychological abuse at the hands of his father and two older, financially successful brothers. While his full motivations are never explicitly stated, Glen begins to use Bone as a scapegoat for his failures as a provider and as a husband. Shortly after marrying Bone's mother, Glen begins to physically and sexually abuse Bone. As is common amongst rape and/or incest victims, Bone is too ashamed to tell her mother or any of her other family members what is happening. Not to mention the fact that Bone comes to blame herself for Glen's behavior.Although there are many warning signs, Bone's mother either refuses to acknowledge her husband's misconduct, or she is simply unaware of what is going on.

I know that what I am viewing is only a movie, but there are certain films that I have watched over the years that leave me speeechless, usually because I am disturbed about a particular subject matter. ""Whats' Love Got To Do With It?"" and ""The Burning Bed"" really got my emotions up and running as they are two films about abused women; another was ""Roots"", the classic TV miniseries that documented African/American slavery in the late 1800's; and finally this unknown gem of a television film made back in the mid 1990's. Angelica Huston made her directorial debut with ""Bastard Out of Carolina"", the most shcoking movie to ever depict child abuse, both physical and sexual. The movie is not for the faint-of-heart by any means, but I know why the film had to be made; it is important to know that what we see in ""Bastard Out of Carolina"" does happen, and it must simply stop. The film was based on a novel by Dorothy Allison and it tells the story of a young girl growing up in the 1950's in the South with her mother and sister. Soon the mother (played wonderfully by Jennifer Jason Leigh) takes on a new husband and the young girl(Bone) finds her life turned upside down when her step-father starts to abuse her both physically and sexually. Ron Eldard does a magnificent job playing the abuser. It is not easy for actors to hurt children even if it is dramatized for the screen. The abusive scenes shown in this film are not easy to watch, but kudos must be given to the extraordinary actors and to Miss Huston for making the scenes look so realistic. There is one scene in particular that the step-father actually takes the little girl and holds her in the air by her head with her body swaying back and forth. As a viewer I found myself screaming at the television set. This signifies at how good this movie is. When a film rises your emotions the film makers are doing their job. ""Bastard Out of Carolina"" was made for one of Ted Turner's TV stations, probably TBS, but upon viewing the film Turner past on airing it citing its graphic nature. Eventaully cable's ""Showtime"" aired it to wonderful ratings. When the film was eventually released on home video it was banned in parts of Canada (mainly in the Maritime provinces), but upon appeal it was released.

It really is quite gripping to see the scenes of verbal, physical, and sexual abuse in this movie, and I am still torned between liking or hating the role of the mother played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, who turned in a fine performance that's reminecent of her role in Dolores Claiborne(Kathy Bates), also a domestic abuse movie.Leigh had three husbands in this movie, the first two died in a car crash, leaving her with  two girls, one from the first husband, and the other from the second. Bone, the elder daughter is about 12 or so, and the younger one is maybe 7. While she's struggling to raise her girls, her brother hooked him up with a good looking co-worker named Glen, played by the very convincing Ron Eldard(House of Sand and Fog). They soon got married and she thought she had married the perfect husband, but she was wrong. His inner monster slowly crawled out, and secretly take his anger and frustration on Bone. On the night of Leigh's labour at the hospital, while waiting in the car, Bone was molested by her step-father for the first time. The following morning, leigh's baby died and she was never have another one again. Bone never said anything about what happened, and it only propelled the BASTARD to continue to act out on her on and off until the relatives found out and proceeded to payback Glen the physical pain. Bone made a decision to leave her mother, and Leigh was devastated and fell guilty for tolerating her monster husband, and she had to choose between staying or go back to her daughter.The three leads are very good in this film, especially Jena Malone, and I think her performance was one of the most challenging for a child actor.

187913,A3028S6C0F8BF0,1572526793,"W.W. Nowe ""enggs""","[13, 14]","You wont like ""Bastard Out of Carolina"". It's one of those few movies that's not meant to please but to disturb and hurt. It's about a poor southern woman and her relationship with her illegitimate daughter. And how that daughter is beaten and molested by her stepfather. Don't let the summary on the back of the box fool you. It may be one of the most misleading things I've ever read. This is not a ""moving story of one woman's passionate resolve to keep her family together"". This is a story about child abuse. It's cold, hard, and in-your-face. The truth is that the mother in this story is a selfish, despicable character. She is just as loathsome as the child molester herself. Maybe more so. She is the one, after all, who is ultimately responsible for protecting her children. But again and again she discovers (or witnesses) the abuse of her daughter only to allow her to end up in the same situation.None of the adults in this movie are admirable characters. Even the ones who care about the little girl an unwilling to take the steps necessary to ensure her safety. Her family lets her stay with them but then just as easily let her go back home. When doctors discover the abuse they rant and rave, and threaten to call the authorities but don't. When the cops finally do find out about the abuse they ask the girl a few questions allow her to be carried out the door and brought back home. What's really disturbing is how accurate this probably is to real life.At one point the family finally has enough and beats the stepfather half-to-death. They don't kill him and they apparently don't report his abuse because we soon find him alone again with the little girl. What follows is the most controversial scene in the movie where the little girl is viciously beaten and raped as she groans in pain and tries to scream for help. Many previous reviewers consider the actual filming of that scene to be child abuse. Make no mistake about it: it is. No child should be asked to do the things Jena Malone does in that scene.But I don't feel that was the worst scene in the movie. The first time she is molested is much tougher to stomach. Jena Malone is an incredible actress (she's the reason I bought this DVD). I honestly can't think of any other actor who can convey so much with just a facial expression. Anjelica Huston used that incredible talent to create one of the most horrible scenes you'll ever see. The girl is sitting on her stepfathers lap in the front seat of his car. A sliver of light is shining through the window just enough to illuminate their faces. The look in her eyes as the act is being committed will chill you to the core. It's haunting. How such a young actor can offer such a look is mind boggling.Don't take my five star rating as a recommendation of this movie. I would never tell anyone they should or shouldn't see this. It's an excellent film. It looks and feels very authentic. It's well acted by Hollywood veterans who've earned much respect and accolades, and once again young Jena Malone steals the show from them all. It's directed by a smart person and a talented filmmaker. I believe Anjelica Huston accomplished exactly what she intended with this movie. You'll never hear another story about child abuse on the news without flashing back to the images you see here. It's a powerful and affecting film.
