It's up there with Black Adder and Fawlty Towers in the madness and the sometimes very twisted story lines. These comedies paved the road for future generations of truly twisted American shows such as American Dad and Family Guy.

783778,A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB,B0000TWMXY,"ANT ""azraelart""","[2, 3]","I am hesitant to classify ""Father Ted"" as a Brit-Com, as it is primarily Irish actors and set on the Emerald Isle.  It was a BBC offering, though, so one can apply that label if desired.  I, personally, prefer to think of Father Ted as a comedy for the world, especially those that don't mind jibes towards the religious community.Unfortunately, Dermot Morgan, who plays the title role, died a day after the last episode was filmed.  Doubtless, there would have been many more seasons of this outstanding and absolutely hilarious series.  Fortunately, we are left with this great set of the complete season, a living memorial of an amazing comedic actor.  It certainly helps that Ardal O'Hanlan (from more recent 'My Hero' fame) plays the increasingly empty-headed assistant to Father Ted.  The rest of the cast round out brilliantly, and guest appearances (including Graham Norton on two episodes) add to the amazing acting throughout the series.Set on Craggy Island just off the west coast of Ireland, the three priests fight off boredom, competing parishes, strange allegations, and religious oppression (strange, I know) in all manner of zany circumstances.  It is part visual humor, part slapstick (light on that front, thankfully), part dialogue/verbal humor, and mostly situational hilarity and parody of itself.If you are very sensitive to religious issues, specifically mockery of the Catholic Church, then this series is not for you.  While all done in good-natured fun, it does take many shots at the Church from the Vatican all the way down to the lay community.  If you are open-minded to such jokes, or if you are merely a fan of britcoms, Irish humor, religious humor, Dermot Morgan, Ardal O'Hanlan, sitcoms, or any similar genre, then this is a must-own DVD.  You will be laughing hysterically, I assure you!(Also, the DVD quality is nigh perfect.  There aren't an extremely large number of special features, but there are enough to round out the DVDs and the episodes have a high level of replay value).",5,BBC Comedy at its Finest!,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,2020,"['am', 'hesitant', 'classify', 'Father', 'Ted', 'Brit-Com', 'primarily', 'Irish', 'actors', 'set', 'Emerald', 'Isle', 'was', 'BBC', 'offering', 'one', 'can', 'apply', 'label', 'desired', 'personally', 'prefer', 'think', 'Father', 'Ted', 'comedy', 'world', 'especially', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'jibes', 'religious', 'community.Unfortunately', 'Dermot', 'Morgan', 'who', 'title', 'role', 'died', 'day', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'filmed', 'Doubtless', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'more', 'seasons', 'outstanding', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'series', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'left', 'great', 'set', 'complete', 'season', 'living', 'memorial', 'amazing', 'comedic', 'actor', 'certainly', 'Ardal', ""O'Hanlan"", 'more', 'recent', ""'My"", 'Hero', 'fame', 'increasingly', 'empty-headed', 'assistant', 'Father', 'Ted', 'rest', 'cast', 'round', 'brilliantly', 'guest', 'appearances', 'including', 'Graham', 'Norton', 'two', 'episodes', 'add', 'amazing', 'acting', 'series.Set', 'Craggy', 'Island', 'just', 'west', 'coast', 'Ireland', 'three', 'priests', 'fight', 'off', 'boredom', 'competing', 'parishes', 'strange', 'allegations', 'religious', 'oppression', 'strange', 'know', 'manner', 'zany', 'circumstances', 'part', 'visual', 'humor', 'part', 'slapstick', 'light', 'front', 'thankfully', 'part', 'dialogue/verbal', 'humor', 'mostly', 'situational', 'hilarity', 'parody', 'itself.If', 'are', 'very', 'sensitive', 'religious', 'issues', 'specifically', 'mockery', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'then', 'series', 'not', 'done', 'good-natured', 'fun', 'take', 'many', 'shots', 'Church', 'Vatican', 'way', 'lay', 'community', 'are', 'open-minded', 'such', 'jokes', 'are', 'merely', 'fan', 'britcoms', 'Irish', 'humor', 'religious', 'humor', 'Dermot', 'Morgan', 'Ardal', ""O'Hanlan"", 'sitcoms', 'similar', 'genre', 'then', 'must-own', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'assure', 'Also', 'DVD', 'quality', 'nigh', 'perfect', 'are', ""n't"", 'extremely', 'large', 'number', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'enough', 'round', 'out', 'DVDs', 'episodes', 'have', 'high', 'level', 'replay', 'value']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 3]","Once upon a time, on an Irish island so small that it didn't appear on the maps, there lived these three priests... yeah, it sounds like the setup for a joke or a really bad religious story.Fortunately it turns out to be the theme for ""Father Ted - The Holy Trilogy,"" a kooky comedy about a trio of painfully unholy priests -- moderately crude, quite goofy, and full of insanity. The series gets progressively weirder as it follows the adventures of the titular character and his drunken and/or idiotic sidekicks, and the cast is absolutely brilliant.On Craggy Island, there's a single Catholic parish run by three priests -- long-suffering Father Ted (Dermot Morgan), half-witted Father Dougal (Ardal O'Hanlon), and deranged foul-mouthed lecherous alcoholic Father Jack (Frank Kelly). They also have a crazy housekeeper obsessed with tea. The priests aren't exactly holy, since all three have been exiled there for various misdeeds.Over the three seasons, the priests encounter the hostile bishop, a sexy author, a dead-boring houseguest, the worst priest in the world, a trio of bishops, TV hosts, a radical feminist rocker, a slutty milkman, a nervous sheep, and a hardcore nun who could double as an inquisitor.They have to deal with the blasphemous pornographic film ""The Passion of St. Tibulus,"" a plague of rabbits, a costume competition, bishop buttkicking, bomb-carrying milk floats (""Ted, I wanna be a priest again!""), Ted's reputation as a racist, priests lost in the vast lingerie department, an about-to-crash plane full of priests, giving up their vices for Lent, entering a singing competition, raffling a car (which Ted has wrecked), a stolen whistle, a disastrous seaside holiday, an appearance on ""Faith of Our Fathers"" and the apparent death of Father Jack.Small warning: ""Father Ted"" is definitely not for anyone who wants an all-sparklyhappysunshiny depiction of Catholic clergy, because... well, there's a reason these guys were exiled to Craggy Island. Except for despair, I'm pretty sure the priests on this show manage to commit all the seven deadly sins, plus Dougal's unofficial sin of mind-blowing idiocy.And it's quite funny. It's not quite as funny as ""Blackadder"" or ""Fawlty Towers,"" but it's got plenty of entertaining stuff here. There's lots of slapstick, strange problems (""Ah no, not Toilet Duck again!""), hilarious dialogue (""Imagine blowing your head off with a shot-gun. How'd he manage to survive that?"" ""He didn't, Dougal... he died""), and the priests being rather unpriestly (one of them may actually be a monkey disguised as a priest).Morgan is quite good as the ""straight man"" of the cast, who is the most normal despite having stolen charity money -- he's constantly dealing with the idiocy around him with a kind of resigned patience (""He loved children... they were terrified of him, though""). O'Hanlon is thoroughly entertaining as the peabrained Dougal, Kelly makes a wonderful gnarled old drunken coot (""FECK! DRINK! GURLS!""), and Jim Norton has a small role as a hostile bishop with a dirty little secret.""Father Ted - The Holy Trilogy"" features the worst Catholic parish in the world, if you consider both priests and parishioners.

Ted battles his own personal shortcomings to try and do what's right and get back in good standing with church. Naturally, the harder he tries the more of a mess is made. Ironically, it often works out best when he acts in not so fatherly a manner to get back and his rivals and superiors.  Dougal is a lovable idiot who just naturally has things go his way, and when they don't, he really doesn't know it anyway.  Jack is just plain disgusting, and seldom sober enough to utter a word from his chair pushed in the far corner of the room (of course, the word is normally ""drink!"").Their faults are many, but a lot less troubling than many real life church issues, and so much funnier!

Ted proclaims his innocence at every opportunity, insisting the money was just Resting in his account. Father Dougal McGuire is a simple minded, childlike person with a fear of women and absolutely no belief in God or Catholocism whatsoever. He describes his career as a Priest as ""a bit of a laugh"". He constantly annoys Ted with his stupidity and came to be on the Island after an incident known only as ""Blackrock"" which involved Nuns. Father Jack Hackett is an elderly priest who is constantly drunk and will drink anything he can get his hands on, including Toilet Duck and Floor Polish (which temporarily kills him) he does not have a liking for water, however and spends most of his time asleep in his chair. He was considered the ""Breakout character"" on the show for his outbursts.Any hope of a fourth series of Father Ted was dashed when Dermot tragically died of a Heart attack only a day after completing recording on the last episode.Father Ted achieved massive popularity in Britain during it's run a popularity that continues strongly today with such festivals as ""Tedfest"" which has been going since 2007 and is held on the Irish island of Inishmore off the coast of Galway.Buy this boxset!

Possibly my favourite comedy of all time, although I already owned series 1&3 on video as soon as I saw this box set I knew it was a must buy.  Father Ted first aired back in 1995 and to be honest I didn't find the first series that funny, it was alright and I watched every episode but I wouldn't have called it essential viewing.However as soon as I saw the first episode of the second series I knew the series had hit the big time.  It was called ""Hell"" and feature the first guest appearance from Graham Norton as Father Noel Furlong, it was hilarious.  Every episode from then on until Dermot Morgan's tragic death was superb.  I don't know what makes it so funny, there's just something about three completely incompetent priests sharing a house in a backwater parish.  You have Father Jack Hackett who is an Alcoholic and generally only utters the words ""FECK"", ""AR*E"" or ""GIRLS"", the incredibly stupid Father Dougal Maguire and then of course Father Ted.  I don't know how popular the show is in America but over here they are still showing repeats on Channel 4's various other channels.I love every episode from the last two series but ones you should particularly check out are ""Speed 3"" the brilliant parody of Speed (If the milkfloat goes under 4 miles an hour the bomb will go off).  ""The Mainland"" which also features Graham Norton, who is the funniest guest character and ""Escape To Victory"" all back to back in Series 3.  The funniest ever though is of course ""A Song For Europe"", especially their final performance live at the Eurovision Song Contest after they find out the music they ""borrowed"" was more famous than they first thought.I could go on all day but you get the general idea, this is a must have for any fans of good comedy.
