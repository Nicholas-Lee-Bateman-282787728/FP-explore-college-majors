96842,A1534MBU6VJXYN,0790731517,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[1, 3]","When this film came out in 1993, many people were surprised at how well this film performed with critics and audiences. Indeed, by that time, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Ann - Margret were no longer surefire box office draws, but enough people were still interested in them, since ""Grumpy..."" grossed $70,000,000 at the box office.The problem is, 11 1/2 years later, ""Grumpy Old Men"" isn't as good as many remember it. A lot of the jokes between Lemmon and Matthau seem dated, and while both turn in excellent performances, you can kind of tell they weren't completely satisfied with the movie. (In 1995, when Entertainment Weekly did an article on the sequel ""Grumpier Old Men"", Matthau confessed he only did the first one for money). When you boil it all down, Ann-Margret kind of carries the movie, as it tends to get boring when she's not onscreen. I actually was upset that she didn't get as much screen time as I thought she had. I saw ""Grumpier Old Men"" (the sequel) first, and noticing how much screen time Sophia Loren got (nearly every scene), I expected the same treatment for Ann. However, the film sometimes goes over 10 minutes without her. I am compelled to say the reason I watch this film is because she looks very beautiful in it. (For proof of what I'm saying, fast forward to the scene where Matthau visits Ann's house for the first time, and pay attention to her outfit, a dark red shoulderless sweater. Even at 51, she still could grab a man's eye).The film's plot is standard comedy fodder. Two old codgers named John Gustafson (Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) have been best enemies for over 50 years. They trade of playful, insulting banter about each other's fishing skills and how much sex they had (I will admit that Lemmon's line ""I've laid more pipe in this town than Wabasha plumbing"" is priceless and quotable). However, all that changes when a beautiful yet highly eccentric widown Ariel Truax (Ann-Margret) moves in across the street. Both men are immediately smitten, and their little fights become an all out war. Both vie for her affections, and at first John has the upper hand, until Max makes him feel sorry for him and practically forces him to give her up. By the time Lemmon's character suffers a heart attack, the film becomes achingly predictable, and while the outtakes at the end are funny, I still felt underwhelmed.I was particularly peeved about the treatment of certain actors, specifically Burgess Meredith. As Lemmon's fiesty ninety-something father, Meredith gave out some great lines and carries a lot of the scenes without Ann-Margret. But overall, his role is basically an extended cameo, and this film really could have used him more. The fact that I felt that the blossoming love between Matthau's son (Kevin Pollak, who is always an entertaining asset to any of his projects) and Lemmon's daughter (Daryl Hannah) and John's IRS troubles (featuring a stern IRS agent portrayed very well by Buck Henry) took center stage more often than the actual plot, plus the fact that Ossie Davis' character was also after Ann-Margret made the film seem to cluttered, didn't help my opinion of the film.So, in conclusion, Ann-Margret and Burgess Meredith are still great in their roles, the joy of seeing Matthau and Lemmon onscreen again still reverberates throughout the film, and the scenery is still awe - inspiring, but ""Grumpy Old Men"" may not be as good as some might remember it.",3,"Good, But It's Lost Some Of Its Magic Over The Years (3 1/2 Stars)",1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,3446,"['When', 'film', 'came', 'out', '1993', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'film', 'performed', 'critics', 'audiences', 'Indeed', 'time', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Ann', 'Margret', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'surefire', 'box', 'office', 'draws', 'enough', 'people', 'were', 'still', 'interested', 'Grumpy', 'grossed', '70,000,000', 'box', 'office.The', 'problem', '11', '1/2', 'years', 'later', 'Grumpy', 'Old', 'Men', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'many', 'remember', 'lot', 'jokes', 'Lemmon', 'Matthau', 'seem', 'dated', 'turn', 'excellent', 'performances', 'can', 'kind', 'tell', 'were', ""n't"", 'completely', 'satisfied', 'movie', '1995', 'when', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'did', 'article', 'sequel', 'Grumpier', 'Old', 'Men', 'Matthau', 'confessed', 'only', 'did', 'first', 'one', 'money', 'When', 'boil', 'down', 'Ann-Margret', 'kind', 'movie', 'get', 'boring', 'when', 'not', 'onscreen', 'actually', 'was', 'upset', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'thought', 'had', 'saw', 'Grumpier', 'Old', 'Men', 'sequel', 'first', 'noticing', 'how', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'got', 'nearly', 'scene', 'expected', 'same', 'treatment', 'Ann', 'However', 'film', 'sometimes', '10', 'minutes', 'am', 'compelled', 'say', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'very', 'beautiful', 'proof', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'fast', 'forward', 'scene', 'where', 'Matthau', 'Ann', 'house', 'first', 'time', 'pay', 'attention', 'outfit', 'dark', 'red', 'shoulderless', 'sweater', 'Even', '51', 'still', 'could', 'grab', 'man', 'eye', 'film', 'plot', 'standard', 'comedy', 'fodder', 'Two', 'old', 'codgers', 'named', 'John', 'Gustafson', 'Lemmon', 'Max', 'Goldman', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'enemies', '50', 'years', 'trade', 'playful', 'insulting', 'banter', 'other', 'fishing', 'skills', 'how', 'much', 'sex', 'had', 'will', 'admit', 'Lemmon', 'line', ""'ve"", 'laid', 'more', 'pipe', 'town', 'Wabasha', 'plumbing', 'priceless', 'quotable', 'However', 'changes', 'when', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'highly', 'eccentric', 'widown', 'Ariel', 'Truax', 'Ann-Margret', 'street', 'men', 'are', 'immediately', 'smitten', 'little', 'fights', 'become', 'out', 'war', 'vie', 'affections', 'first', 'John', 'upper', 'hand', 'Max', 'feel', 'sorry', 'practically', 'forces', 'give', 'up', 'time', 'Lemmon', 'character', 'heart', 'attack', 'film', 'achingly', 'predictable', 'outtakes', 'end', 'are', 'funny', 'still', 'felt', 'underwhelmed.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'peeved', 'treatment', 'certain', 'actors', 'specifically', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'Lemmon', 'fiesty', 'ninety-something', 'father', 'Meredith', 'gave', 'out', 'great', 'lines', 'lot', 'scenes', 'Ann-Margret', 'overall', 'role', 'basically', 'extended', 'cameo', 'film', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'fact', 'felt', 'blossoming', 'love', 'Matthau', 'son', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'who', 'always', 'entertaining', 'asset', 'projects', 'Lemmon', 'daughter', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'John', 'IRS', 'troubles', 'featuring', 'stern', 'IRS', 'agent', 'portrayed', 'very', 'well', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'took', 'center', 'stage', 'more', 'often', 'actual', 'plot', 'fact', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'Ann-Margret', 'made', 'film', 'seem', 'cluttered', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'opinion', 'film.So', 'conclusion', 'Ann-Margret', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'roles', 'joy', 'seeing', 'Matthau', 'Lemmon', 'onscreen', 'again', 'still', 'film', 'scenery', 'still', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'Grumpy', 'Old', 'Men', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'might', 'remember']",Grumpy Old Men

They're both very capable dramatic actors, and each has an Academy Award as proof, but their signature trademark will always be their comedic ability.In this movie, Lemmon and Matthau play the roles of John and Max, respectively.  John and Max have been next-door neighbors their whole lives, and though they have an extremely hostile love/hate relationship, they remain each other's best friend.  Their hostility stems from decades before when John wound up marrying the girl they both loved.  Both are now widowers who live alone in their separate houses, and a woman named Ariel (Ann-Margret) moves into the house across the street.  Both men are immediately smitten by Ariel, and it leads to a rehashing of the same hostile feelings they once held for each other in their youth.While the plot may seem like heavy material, it really isn't.  The story is presented in a extremely touching yet light-hearted way.  Both John and Max are extremely loveable, and the audience is made to feel sorry for them because both are lonely in their old age.  The only flaw in this movie is in the plausability of Ariel actually having romantic feelings for either of these two men.  She's a relatively young woman and energetic woman, and the fact that she has these two old men fighting for her attention doesn't seem quite believable.Regardless, this is an excellent movie that I definitely recommend.",4,Hilariously Touching!

With the additional brilliant comic performance of Burgess Meredith, Grumpy Old Men transforms from a gem of a picture into one of the funniest movies ever made. A sweeping commercial success, the film spawned the sequel Grumpier Old Men - a rare breed of movie that almost lived up to the quality of the original...In Grumpy Old Men, lifelong friends and neighbors John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) trade jibes on a daily basis against the backdrop of the frozen Minnesota tundra. Maintaining a relationship that appears to be nothing more than a give and take of acerbic sarcasm, the two men actually enjoy a strong bond of kinship that has lasted all their lives. Widowed and retired, both men live a confined and comfortable existence, defined by routine ice fishing trips and visits from immediate family.But John and Max both find new life when a rambunctious vixen named Ariel Truax (Ann-Margret) moves into the neighborhood. Ariel befriends both men who act as if they aren't interested in her because of their inner fears of leaving their comfort zone. It takes the actions of their friend, local fish store owner Chuck (Ossie Davis), to jar the two men from their comfortable, yet boring lives. When Chuck pays a visit to Ariel's house late one night, he rouses the jealousy of both men who instantly transform into competitors for Ariel's affections.While Max seemingly has the upper-hand in the quest, the tables quickly turn in John's favor when Ariel communicates her feelings during a late night visit to the Gustafson abode... Meanwhile, John's daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollack) develop a romantic relationship with one another.With John and Ariel becoming an item themselves, a wedge is further driven between John and Max who continue their feuding unabated. Only a true father can break up these two fighting boys, which John's father does... But will their friendship be ruined forever?Flooded with countless one-liners, perfect delivery of insults, and an endless number of comic scenes, Grumpy Old Men is one of the most hilarious films you'll ever have the pleasure of enjoying. The onscreen magic between Lemmon and Malthau is unsurpassed by any comedy duo before or since, and the screenplay is expertly written. In fact, the closing credits may actually be more entertaining than the film itself, which is quite an accomplishment. As the credits run the course of the screen, original outtakes from the film are shown.

96865,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,0790731517,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[1, 2]","I read in an interview that Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon had never had one argument in their life. That struck me as surprising since the two argue so well - and there's a whole lot of arguing in this 1993 movie that spawned one sequel.This particular movie holds a special interest for me. My family in the United Kingdom had hosted a Minnesota student in the 1980s and so I have made a number of return trips to the state over the years. When this movie was released I was spending the Christmas holidays with friends in the `Land of 10,000 Lakes' where this is set and saw this movie with a girlfriends family on New Year's Eve. There's something to be said about watching a Minnesota movie among a crowd of Minnesotans - they just get the humor and are so self-deprecating that when the movie pokes fun at their culture (ice fishing huts ON the lake) they take it in their stride with good humor.Set in the fictional town of Wabasha, Minn. the movie follows the age-old rivalry between John Gustafson (Lemmon) and  Max Goldman (Matthau) and the interest they share in their new neighbor across the street, the free-spirited Ariel Truax (played by the timeless beauty Ann-Margret.)Of course the highlight of this movie is seeing the two (Matthau and Lemmon) shoot of barbs at each other. The characters apparently were friends when younger but a woman caused the two to break off a friendship and the arrival of Truax has reawakened all those feelings. In fact one of the overriding images I have of this movie is the sight of Max trying to spear John with a frozen fish as Burgess Meredith storms through a crowd of on-lookers to order him to ""Put that fish down!"" It's hard to tie down exactly why this movie works so well and has so many gut-busting moments, the two obviously have a great chemistry and their comic timing is second to none. The barbs are funny and the pranks that they play on each other are both ingenious (Max using his TV remote to change Johns TV channel as the latter is trying to follow the lottery results) and at times juvenile (John putting a fish in the back of Max's truck).Combined they gel into one very funny movie. And the coup de grace comes when Max shows his true affection for John by helping him after he suffers a stroke, both in getting him to the hospital and then in fighting for him with the IRS man who is determined to seize Gustafson's home.There is also that golden  moment at the hospital when the nurse asks him if he is ""friend or family"" to John and after a moments pause Max admits ""friend."" Some have accused this movie if losing it's way in its final act, but personally I find the closing minutes of the movie to be among the best dramatically and let's face it - who wouldn't like to see this particular IRS man get his comeuppance.Added to this movie are the two long suffering children of the pair. Daryl Hannah (whatever happened to her) appears as John's daughter Melanie and Kevin Pollak appears as Max's son Jacob.A word of caution, there is some very adult language in this movie, in fact some referred to it as ""Dirty Old Men' back when it was released. If you have only seen this movie on TV where some words of dialogue are noticeably changed, then chances are you have not been exposed to the great comic timing of Matthau and Lemmon.This movie is available by itself or as part of a collection with its inferior (but still funny) sequel GRUMOIER OLD MEN. In both instances however the movie is only available in full-screen. Hopefully Warner will release a widescreen version with special features in the future. But for now sit back and enjoy two masters of comedy work their magic, and be sure the stick around for the outtakes at the end  which are usually edited - probably for language, from TV broadcasts. They are all extremely funny and elicited some of the biggest laughs with the audience I saw the movie with.",5,Witness two masters of comedy ply their trade - a classic,1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,3896,"['read', 'interview', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'had', 'never', 'had', 'one', 'argument', 'life', 'struck', 'surprising', 'two', 'argue', 'so', 'well', 'whole', 'lot', 'arguing', '1993', 'movie', 'spawned', 'one', 'sequel.This', 'particular', 'movie', 'special', 'interest', 'family', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'had', 'hosted', 'Minnesota', 'student', '1980s', 'so', 'have', 'made', 'number', 'return', 'trips', 'state', 'years', 'When', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'spending', 'Christmas', 'holidays', 'friends', 'Land', '10,000', 'Lakes', 'where', 'set', 'saw', 'movie', 'girlfriends', 'family', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'watching', 'Minnesota', 'movie', 'crowd', 'Minnesotans', 'just', 'get', 'humor', 'are', 'so', 'self-deprecating', 'when', 'movie', 'fun', 'culture', 'ice', 'fishing', 'huts', 'ON', 'lake', 'take', 'stride', 'good', 'humor.Set', 'fictional', 'town', 'Wabasha', 'Minn.', 'movie', 'age-old', 'rivalry', 'John', 'Gustafson', 'Lemmon', 'Max', 'Goldman', 'Matthau', 'interest', 'share', 'new', 'neighbor', 'street', 'free-spirited', 'Ariel', 'Truax', 'played', 'timeless', 'beauty', 'Ann-Margret', 'course', 'highlight', 'movie', 'seeing', 'two', 'Matthau', 'Lemmon', 'shoot', 'barbs', 'other', 'characters', 'apparently', 'were', 'friends', 'when', 'younger', 'woman', 'caused', 'two', 'break', 'off', 'friendship', 'arrival', 'Truax', 'reawakened', 'feelings', 'fact', 'one', 'overriding', 'images', 'have', 'movie', 'sight', 'Max', 'trying', 'spear', 'John', 'frozen', 'fish', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'storms', 'crowd', 'on-lookers', 'order', 'Put', 'fish', 'down', 'hard', 'tie', 'down', 'exactly', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'many', 'gut-busting', 'moments', 'two', 'obviously', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'comic', 'timing', 'second', 'none', 'barbs', 'are', 'funny', 'pranks', 'play', 'other', 'are', 'ingenious', 'Max', 'using', 'TV', 'remote', 'change', 'Johns', 'TV', 'channel', 'latter', 'trying', 'follow', 'lottery', 'results', 'times', 'juvenile', 'John', 'putting', 'fish', 'back', 'Max', 'truck', '.Combined', 'gel', 'one', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'coup', 'de', 'grace', 'when', 'Max', 'true', 'affection', 'John', 'helping', 'stroke', 'getting', 'hospital', 'then', 'fighting', 'IRS', 'man', 'who', 'determined', 'seize', 'Gustafson', 'home.There', 'also', 'golden', 'moment', 'hospital', 'when', 'nurse', 'friend', 'family', 'John', 'moments', 'Max', 'friend', 'have', 'accused', 'movie', 'losing', 'way', 'final', 'act', 'personally', 'find', 'closing', 'minutes', 'movie', 'be', 'best', 'dramatically', 'let', 'face', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', 'particular', 'IRS', 'man', 'get', 'comeuppance.Added', 'movie', 'are', 'two', 'long', 'suffering', 'children', 'pair', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'happened', 'John', 'daughter', 'Melanie', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'Max', 'son', 'Jacob.A', 'word', 'caution', 'very', 'adult', 'language', 'movie', 'fact', 'referred', 'Dirty', 'Old', 'Men', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'movie', 'TV', 'where', 'words', 'dialogue', 'are', 'noticeably', 'changed', 'then', 'chances', 'are', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'exposed', 'great', 'comic', 'timing', 'Matthau', 'Lemmon.This', 'movie', 'available', 'part', 'collection', 'inferior', 'still', 'funny', 'sequel', 'GRUMOIER', 'OLD', 'MEN', 'instances', 'however', 'movie', 'only', 'available', 'full-screen', 'Hopefully', 'Warner', 'will', 'release', 'widescreen', 'version', 'special', 'features', 'future', 'now', 'back', 'enjoy', 'two', 'masters', 'comedy', 'work', 'magic', 'be', 'sure', 'stick', 'outtakes', 'end', 'are', 'usually', 'edited', 'probably', 'language', 'TV', 'broadcasts', 'are', 'extremely', 'funny', 'elicited', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'audience', 'saw', 'movie']",Grumpy Old Men

The screenplay is at once very funny and touching, telling with tongue in cheek the good things and the bad things about being old. To remind us that age is only comparative, one of the old men's fathers is also here, played hilariously by Batman's Burgess Meredith. He shows the two younger 'old men' that there is still lots of fun to be had and perhaps lots of years left if you're lucky. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau hasn't faded over the years, and they still work off each other well. As someone who has been to Minnesota in wintertime I could almost feel the cold biting through those poor guys' clothes as they went ice fishing. The delightful Ann-Margret (does she never look older?) is excellent casting as someone who could at once be near enough Lemmon's age to have a relationship with him and also look young enough to be a seemingly unattainable object of his lust.

I found it on the five-dollar rack at Wal-Mart and jumped at the chance to buy it. Lemmon and Matthau are two of my favorite old-line comedians. I remembered when the show first came out and I missed it because of an overly busy schedule. Well, these two ""Senior Comedians"" play a couple of aging Middle-School chums to perfection. All the middle school insulting language and pranks are still there even though these guys have aged an additional 55 years and each has gone through a marriage. Now they're both bachelors again and living next to one another in their well-aged middle-school condition. It's funny. Trust me. And they bring it off well, right from the opening all the way through. The scene is complicated by the arrival of a new woman (Ann-Margaret) in the neighborhood, something of a rivalry romance develops and it's right back to the good-old high-school days when they were sparring over a different girl.Add to the story that everything took place in a Minnesota winter. It made me realize how much I enjoyed the winters in this part of the country and how boring things are in San Diego winters. Alas, It was a good setting and had a lot of winter activities such as snowmobiles and ice fishing. The winter scenery was very well done. Just as I remembered. Nice touch. The acting was excellent and the story unfolded at a nice pace. The romance between Lemmon and Ann-Margaret seemed a bit unrealistic, but hey, this is a comedy. In any case, I'm now 76 and they were 68, and I winced here and there but thoroughly enjoyed the movie.Gary Peterson",5,A Tale of Aging Middle-School Chums.

All of the film's ""old men""--grumpy or otherwise--have died in recent years. Most recently Ossie Davis who played the more aimiable Chuck.  And of course, Lemmon and Matthau were preceeded a few years in death by Burgess Meredith, who as Lemmon's crusty father, provided some of the film's biggest laughs.  (Don't miss the now-legendary comic outtakes that run over the final credits.)  One can't exactly talk about a ""GRUMPY OLD MEN curse"" or anything.  These were all men fairly well advanced in years, but it adds a certain melancholic tinge to to the various death-related gags--of which there are several--in the movie.But GOM is also, as they say, a ""life affirming"" movie.  Nothing truly original, certainly, but it comes by its laughs and tears about as honestly as any Hollywood film ever does.  Lemmon and Matthau could have walked through roles clearly written for them.  They riff of each other like they did previously in THE ODD COUPLE movies, and they do so with such finesse that it's hard not to love 'em.  And then there's Ann-Margret, looking great, and acting as kooky and as unconventional as she ever did in any 60s era flick.  Is it kookiness of a conventional Hollywood sort?  Well, yes and no.  She's clearly meant to be a breath of fresh air on the frozen Minnesota tundra.  And she pulls  it off.  Her unconventionality is pretty much dream factory standard issue--midnight snowmobile rides and 1 AM drop by visits to a new neighbor are eccentricity writ pretty darn large.  But this is Ann-Margret we're talking about.  And she imbues her character with genuine warmth and sexiness, so much so that Lemmon's character can only be said to be lapsing into downright idiocy to even think of giving her up for the sake of friendship.Matthau and Lemmon were great comic actors.  GOM is an entertainment, not great filmmaking.  But it's good entertainment.

96904,A2466GHR89BOSL,0790731517,"Lee Roschen ""Lee""","[1, 1]","First off, I must show an obvious bias toward this movie.  The setting is Wabasha, Minnesota.  It IS NOT a fictional place.  It is located about halfway between St. Paul, MN and LaCrosse, WI on US-61, which is one of the most scenic highways in America, especially in the autumn.  My mother was raised in Wabasha, and my late father born and raised 15 miles away in Lake City, which is where my mother lives today. It is where I actually call my ""home away from home."" So of course, there are many aspects of the movie I can personally relate to, like the real Slippery's in Wabasha, which in real life is much classier than a throw-your-peanut-shells-on-the-floor tavern.  The people living in this area are very down to earth and friendly, and for many, fishing and snowmobiling in winter is a way of life as portrayed in this movie.  The city of Wabasha (population 2600) has so exploited the ""grumpy flicks"" they now host a Grumpy Old Men Festival every February!  How cool is that???Now considering these facts, Max Goldman (played by Walter Matthau) and John Gustafson (played by Jack Lemmon) truly exemplify the persona of real life in Wabasha, with the twist being these two very schmucky widowers who having known each other since childhood, living next door to each other most of their lives, and still have NEVER gotten along with each other. That's when the lovely Ariel Truax (played by Ann Margaret) moves into the house across the street while accepting a faculty position at Winona State University (where my late father actually went to college) some 30 miles away. This sends the two ""grumpys"" into an infatuated tizzy, and they both put on their best impression in schmoozing her, with the grumpy old man Gustafson finally winning out. The movie is complete with off-the-wall pranks and schmucky humor, and John Gustafson's dad (played by Burgess Meredith), in his second-to-last acting role, is an absolute scream with his antics. Some of the language contained herein is rather vulgar, and I would not recommend anyone younger than age 17 to watch it unless with a parent.

Two years later the were reteamed in the movie that would elevate them to superstars, The Odd Couple.  The would make twelve films together (one Jack just directed (Kotch), one they would just have a few scenes together (The Grass Harp) and one they never had a scene together (JFK)).  Grumpy Old Men was the seventh film together.John (Jack) and Max (Walter) have been lifelong neighbors who have been feuding most of the time.  Both are widowed with children (Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollock).  They both share a passion for fishing - summer and winter ice fishing.Things hit a fever pitch when Alex (Ann-Margret) buys the house across the street from the boys.  Alex is a sexy free spirited widow.  Both men want Alex and do anything to one up the other to get her attentions.Things even heat up between the kids.  They have always liked each other but never acted on it.  Now they are both single, they decide to act on it.This is a variation of The Odd Couple characters thirty years later.  While Oscar and Felix were still in their prime, Max and John are at the end.  Oscar and Felix's differences stemmed from their personality traits and Max and John's were from social conditions.In any case, this is one of the best teamings of Jack and Walter.  Add to this a hilarious performance by Burgess Meridith as John's father.  While Ann-Margret is an unrealistic choice for their object of desire but she handles it perfectly.DVD EXTRAS:  NoneNOTE: This is a full screen version.

It's funny, joyfull, and heartwarming. These two were the perfect match for an EXCELLENT movie like this. The plot of the movie is great. The setting of cold and snowy Wabasha, MN was a the perfect setting.The movie starts out on a snowy morning with two rivaling neighbors John Gustufson (Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Matthau). These two have been at each other's throats since they were kids. They always insult each other like calling each other a putz, a moron, or even a schmuck and other rude names. Whatever the two do they compete against each other to be better. One of those things they compete against is they both ice fish everyday and Max always ends up with more fish than John. So one day after they finish fishing, Max has half a dozen fish and John only has two. So Max of course picks on him and John throws one of his dead fishes into Max's car which causes a terrible stench.That night John is watching the lottery and Max has the same T.V. remote so while John's watching the numbers Max over in the next window switches the channel. Then John switches it back then Max does it again and again. Finally John finds out it's Max and Max's son Jake (Pollak) opens the window to make him apologize and when Max goes to the window, John sprays his garden hose at him. Will these two ever stop fighting?Then the rivalry takes another step up when a beautiful new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) moves in and catches the attention of Max and John. Ariel is a lovely, warm-hearted, spirited woman who Max and John start fighting over. Max takes her ice fishing where she catches a 3-foot fish that she actually THROWS BACK before Max can take a picture of it. Then John and Ariel have dinner together and then go snowmobiling together and eventually sleep together. MAX IS FURIOUS!!!Now Max and John are out fishing and Max is thinking of how to seek revenge. So John is in his shanty when it starts moving. He looks out the window and Max is moving it with his car heading straight for THIN ICE. John jumps out and his shanty is sunk. Of course Max is in his car chanting, ""Yeah!"" The two finally have a brawl and John is convinced that Max deserves Ariel more than he does because John can't support her because his house is about to be taken away from the IRS.Will John get her or will Max?

96933,A39Z52KPAO8YR7,0790731517,Skyclad,"[0, 0]","Grumpy Old Men is probably my favorite comedy of all time. I saw it in the theater back when it came out, then bought the VHS tape as soon as it was released. Then when DVD's took off, I waited and waited and waited for it to be released. It finally was, but only in FULL SCREEN. So I never bought it and only ever had the VHS version until this Bluray came out. Nothing more needs to be said about this movie, it is hilarious and heart-warming at the same time. A gem of a movie that shows you do not have to act old just because you hit your 60's, 70's or 80's. So I won't say any more about that... I will say it is so nice to finally see this in widescreen, and for a movie pushing 20 years old, the picture quality is great. It is a BIG bummer that all that is included on this Bluray disc is ONE trailer. This is easily the weakest Bluray I own when it comes to bonus features. But... I feel happy to get the movie and since it was only [...] bucks new, I can't complain.
