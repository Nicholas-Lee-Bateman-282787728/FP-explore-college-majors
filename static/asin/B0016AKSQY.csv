1153170,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0016AKSQY,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","In the recent past in this space I have gone on and on about the old country blues performed after a hard, hard week's work on a Saturday in the local `juke joints' down in the southern United States in places like rural Mississippi and Alabama before World War II. Of course, then the music took the road north, especially after the war and got electrified to fit the needs of the new black migration that was heading up river to find work (and get the hell away from Jim Crow) in the newly unionized (in most cases) industrial plants. But what about those left behind, or those who did not or could not go north? Or just wanted to, or had to, keep away from the cities with their treacherous ways? Answering those questions, in a nutshell, forms the plotline to this entertaining little saga about the trials and tribulations of modernization, blues version.Okay, here is the plot line. A struggling juke joint owner, Pine Top Purvis (also the house piano player), played by star Danny Glover, is financially in deep trouble and needs a quick fix to keep the wolves from the door. Nothing seems to be working for the man, especially when a regionally well-known early R&B; hot shot who is suppose to resolve all Danny's financial problems is a no show. Not to worry, an itinerant R&B; wannabe just happens to ride the blinds into town, gets himself into trouble (mainly for being black while seeking a work-some things never change), and in the end is Danny's salvation by performing a successful  Saturday gig  and saving the day.Along the way we also get small glimpse of black rural life including, naturally, the ardors of plantation life, -that means cotton picking, the tough times of small time musical talents, the role of the religious tent revival in rural life and needless to say, the confinements, large and small, of Jim Crow, physically, mentally and spiritually. I have reviewed plenty of film documentaries in this space that touch on the blues and the social milieu that it derived from. While those vehicles still give a historically more accurate account of what went into create that special blues idiom just before it got electrified this film is not a bad take on what that was all about- a little prettified up to be sure.",4,A Juke Joint Saga,1249344000,"08 4, 2009",2009,2248,"['recent', 'past', 'space', 'have', 'gone', 'old', 'country', 'blues', 'performed', 'hard', 'hard', 'week', 'work', 'Saturday', 'local', 'juke', 'joints', 'down', 'southern', 'United', 'States', 'places', 'rural', 'Mississippi', 'Alabama', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'course', 'then', 'music', 'took', 'road', 'north', 'especially', 'war', 'got', 'electrified', 'fit', 'needs', 'new', 'black', 'migration', 'was', 'heading', 'up', 'river', 'find', 'work', 'get', 'hell', 'away', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'newly', 'unionized', 'most', 'cases', 'industrial', 'plants', 'what', 'left', 'behind', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'could', 'not', 'go', 'north', 'just', 'wanted', 'had', 'keep', 'away', 'cities', 'treacherous', 'ways', 'Answering', 'questions', 'nutshell', 'plotline', 'entertaining', 'little', 'saga', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'modernization', 'blues', 'version.Okay', 'here', 'plot', 'line', 'struggling', 'juke', 'joint', 'owner', 'Pine', 'Top', 'Purvis', 'also', 'house', 'piano', 'player', 'played', 'star', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'financially', 'deep', 'trouble', 'quick', 'fix', 'keep', 'wolves', 'door', 'Nothing', 'be', 'working', 'man', 'especially', 'when', 'regionally', 'well-known', 'early', 'R', 'B', 'hot', 'shot', 'who', 'suppose', 'resolve', 'Danny', 'financial', 'problems', 'show', 'Not', 'worry', 'itinerant', 'R', 'B', 'wannabe', 'just', 'ride', 'blinds', 'town', 'trouble', 'mainly', 'being', 'black', 'seeking', 'work-some', 'things', 'never', 'change', 'end', 'Danny', 'salvation', 'performing', 'successful', 'Saturday', 'gig', 'saving', 'day.Along', 'way', 'also', 'get', 'small', 'glimpse', 'black', 'rural', 'life', 'including', 'naturally', 'ardors', 'plantation', 'life', '-that', 'cotton', 'picking', 'tough', 'times', 'small', 'time', 'musical', 'talents', 'role', 'religious', 'tent', 'revival', 'rural', 'life', 'needless', 'say', 'confinements', 'large', 'small', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'physically', 'mentally', 'spiritually', 'have', 'reviewed', 'plenty', 'film', 'documentaries', 'space', 'touch', 'blues', 'social', 'milieu', 'derived', 'vehicles', 'still', 'give', 'historically', 'more', 'accurate', 'account', 'what', 'went', 'create', 'special', 'blues', 'idiom', 'just', 'got', 'electrified', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'take', 'what', 'was', 'about-', 'little', 'prettified', 'be', 'sure']",Honeydripper (2008)

It's fascinating to see, looking back, how people were dumbfounded at the idea of an electric guitar (""How does it make a sound? There's no soundhole!"") The 50's and 60's were definitely the most exciting decades for being a musician--new ideas, musical styles and technology were developing at rapid speeds all over the place. What this movie does is provide an insight in how these kind of changes impacted a smalltown community in the south in 1950. The famous Guitar Sam (a character very obviously inspired by real blues artist Guitar Slim) backs out on a gig at the Honeydripper. No problem, some local upstart kid with an electric guitar can fill in for him--as Guitar Sam! The people in the community are so technologically deprived that they don't even know what Guitar Sam looks like, even though they eagerly flock to the club to see him perform!Danny Glover does a great job in portraying the down-on-his-luck club owner, who needs to free himself of debt and his own demons stemming from an incident in his past. Keb Mo also does a great job in playing the guitar-playing character who embodies these demons.Great music from Keb Mo and the other artists who supply the music. The piano playing during the end credits is some of the best blues piano playing you will ever hear! Fantastic! Great movie!

1153173,A1UNXVMM0JCVLK,B0016AKSQY,"B B McGuire ""Buster""","[21, 21]","John Sayles is a true independant filmmaker who not only finances, directs, edits and writes his movies but often times acts in and writes music for them. For ""Honeydripper"" Sayles did it all, and he wrote a couple of songs. He has dealt with the African American experience in movies before like: ""Brother From Another Planet"", ""Passion Fish"" and ""City of Hope"", but since most of the characters in ""Honeydripper"" are black he delves even deeper into the issue and the film is written more like a play with echoes of the work of August Wilson.It's 1950 in the deep South and Danny Glover's Tyrone is barely making it and his Honeydripper lounge featuring aging blues players can't compete with the popular Jukejoint next door. To make matters worse the Honeydripper is about to close down unless Tyrone can come up with some serious money.Most of the story revolves around the conflicts and relationships Tyrone has with his wife ( a powerful performance by Lisa Gay Hamilton), his partner (an excellent Charles Dutton), his daughter (a nice debut by model Ya Ya DeCosta), a young musician stranger (effectively played by young bluesman Gary Clark Jr.) and the white sheriff (a tailor made role for Stacey Keach). My favorite character is played by veteran bluesman Keb' Mo', a sort of bluesy greek chorus muse who appears at pivotal times only to Glover and Clark.Sayles always takes his time developing his characters and the world in which they live, and though it may seem slow at first this lets you begin to care about what will happen to them. A big plus is the terrific music, and except for Glover, it is all played by the actors themselves and surprisingly it was all done live while filming.Yes the movie, like a play, takes it's time to develop, but the payoff was one of the most uplifting times I've had at the movies in a long while.I read that Sayles has decided to stop making movies and just write. I'm sure it must be getting harder to get these kinds of movies made and harder still to get them released, unfortunately no one makes movies like John Sayles.",5,No one makes movies like John Sayles !,1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,2077,"['John', 'Sayles', 'true', 'independant', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'finances', 'directs', 'edits', 'movies', 'often', 'times', 'acts', 'writes', 'music', 'Honeydripper', 'Sayles', 'did', 'wrote', 'couple', 'songs', 'dealt', 'African', 'American', 'experience', 'movies', 'Brother', 'Planet', 'Passion', 'Fish', 'City', 'Hope', 'most', 'characters', 'Honeydripper', 'are', 'black', 'even', 'deeper', 'issue', 'film', 'written', 'more', 'play', 'echoes', 'work', 'August', 'Wilson.It', '1950', 'deep', 'South', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Tyrone', 'barely', 'making', 'Honeydripper', 'lounge', 'featuring', 'aging', 'blues', 'players', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'popular', 'Jukejoint', 'next', 'door', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Honeydripper', 'close', 'down', 'Tyrone', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'serious', 'money.Most', 'story', 'conflicts', 'relationships', 'Tyrone', 'wife', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Lisa', 'Gay', 'Hamilton', 'partner', 'excellent', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'daughter', 'nice', 'debut', 'model', 'Ya', 'Ya', 'DeCosta', 'young', 'musician', 'stranger', 'effectively', 'played', 'young', 'bluesman', 'Gary', 'Clark', 'Jr.', 'white', 'sheriff', 'tailor', 'made', 'role', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'favorite', 'character', 'played', 'veteran', 'bluesman', 'Keb', 'Mo', 'sort', 'bluesy', 'greek', 'chorus', 'muse', 'who', 'pivotal', 'times', 'only', 'Glover', 'Clark.Sayles', 'always', 'time', 'developing', 'characters', 'world', 'live', 'may', 'seem', 'slow', 'first', 'begin', 'care', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'big', 'plus', 'terrific', 'music', 'Glover', 'played', 'actors', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'done', 'live', 'movie', 'play', 'time', 'develop', 'payoff', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'uplifting', 'times', ""'ve"", 'had', 'movies', 'long', 'while.I', 'read', 'Sayles', 'decided', 'stop', 'making', 'movies', 'just', 'write', ""'m"", 'sure', 'must', 'be', 'getting', 'harder', 'get', 'kinds', 'movies', 'made', 'harder', 'still', 'get', 'released', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'movies', 'John', 'Sayles']",Honeydripper (2008)

Other reviewers refer to this film as ""leisurly paced"" and ""takes time with character development."" The scenes ARE played far too slow, the actors need to pick up the pace, the edits need to move faster. I gave it a chance, I sat through the entire thing, but not only was it boring, it was predictable. I was drawn to this movie due to the subject matter, but it was highly unrealistic. Despite its PG13 rating this IS a family picture, pure ""fabricated history"" ala Walt Disney television movies from the early 60s. This is a good movie for families with young children who wish to create revisionist history for their kids to protect them from the harsh realities of the Black experience in the American Rural South of the early 1950s. Overall the acting is good, the characters are well cast, but it's obvious they were encouraged with their slow delivery of lines to the point where it almost seems Gary Clark Jr. is actually trying to remember his next line.

A gifted storyteller, not one of his films is alike, but hes's at his best when he takes a small moment in time and uses it to explore a major change.  EIGHT MEN OUT uses the Black Sox scandal to reflect the loss of innocence of our nation.  LONE STAR uses a murder mystery to unearth skeletons long hidden, etc.  With HONEYDRIPPER, Sayles latest, he explores the moment Blues Became Electric, opening the door for Rock & Roll, the dominant music of the last half of the 20th Century.  He does so in the style of the late August Wilson, using quiet rhythms and essentially one locale to tell the story.  In the process, he gets allows his stellar cast to deliver some great performances, including Danny Glover, Charles S. Dutton, Keb Mo, Vondie Curtis-Hall and newcomer YaYa Dacosta, as China Doll.  Gary Clark, Jr. is a little stiff in his acting debut, but once he picks up the guitar, he puts a smile on your face.  Parts of the story may move a little slow, but Honeydripper's built for comfort, not for speed.  Once you know the plot, you'll begin to pick out minor details in the fabric of the film that absolutely glow.  Mind you, this is a film that could never be made within the Hollywood studio system, so if you're looking for Rush Hour 3, then move along.
