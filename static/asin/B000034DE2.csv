And like some of their ilk, the results are mixed.  Which is better than most of their ilk, who are just plain lousy.I  first saw Constantine and The Cross three years ago on an EP recorded  videotape released by DEC.  Now with the DVD, I've noticed a few changes.  First, the main titles and prologue were rife with print damage: tears,  scratches, etc.  It looks like they've gone back and cleaned it up by  running still images of each title card over the original music.  The  prologue text following it looks video generated, evidenced by the black  dropshadow that wasn't there in the original text.  Otherwise, the DVD is  about the same as the tape, with the faded color and print damage mentioned  by the first reviewer.  Also worth mentioning is how the movie(both DVD and  VHS) is letterboxed at a ratio significantly less than the 2.35 to 1 ratio  of its Totalscope process.  2 to 1 at best, and everyone is a little on the  thin side, suggesting then that the anamorphic print was not fully  &quot;unsqueezed&quot;.The technical issues aside, I must say that  Constantine and The Cross is a good movie that separates itself from other  Italian spectacles with an intelligent script and capable actors.

515884,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B000034DE2,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[43, 43]","The vast majority of this movie that centers on Constantine's personal life is pure fiction.  However, that is not so bad;  &quot;Gladiator&quot;  re-wrote history, too, but was nonetheless a great movie.  And this movie  does not fabricate history just to fabricate, but rather it does so with  the objective of tying Constantine and Christianity together.One of  the more notable scenes in which historical fact comes together with a  fudging of Constantine's life is the arena scene.  In this segment,  Constantine jumps down into a pit where Christians are maliciously being  slaughtered.  Historically, the feeding-the-Christians-to-the-lions motif  is right on.  Under the emperor Galerius (ruled 305-311 A.D., shortly  before Constantine ascended to the throne), Christian persecution was at  its height.  While it is untrue that Constantine slew lions to save  Christians, the arena scene nevertheless serves as an excellent depiction  of incidents which really happened.The really notable quality of this  movie lies in its portrayal of major historical happenings.  As a previous  reviewer noted, Diocletian and Maximian really did abdicate the throne in  308. It is also true that his mother, Helena, was a Christian (although the  details re: his relationship w/her in the movie are fictional).  He did  marry Fausta (although he had her and his eldest son Crispus put to death  for treason in 326 - long after the time period covered in this movie).  The inclusion of Constantine's &quot;divine vision&quot; before his battle  with Maxentius is essential;  perhaps one of the defining moments in the  entire history of Christianity.  The actual battle itself is also given  accurate treatment as Maxentius' cavalry was ambushed and trapped by  Constantine's forces, just as the film claims.Now, for the bad news.  I  found the acting of the females in this movie quite well done, but the male  actors were stilted, overly-dramatic &amp; pretty much downright awful.  The quality of the film itself also leaves quite a bit to be desired.  All  of the scratches and skips are amplified by the DVD picture.All in all,  this film is most definitely not for everyone.  However, it is well worth  the time for anyone who is interested in Roman history, world history or  the history of Christianity.",3,Worth seeing for fans of antiquity,966470400,"08 17, 2000",2000,2306,"['vast', 'majority', 'movie', 'Constantine', 'personal', 'life', 'pure', 'fiction', 'However', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'quot', 'Gladiator', 'quot', 're-wrote', 'history', 'too', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'great', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'fabricate', 'history', 'just', 'fabricate', 'rather', 'so', 'objective', 'tying', 'Constantine', 'Christianity', 'together.One', 'more', 'notable', 'scenes', 'historical', 'fact', 'together', 'fudging', 'Constantine', 'life', 'arena', 'scene', 'segment', 'Constantine', 'down', 'pit', 'where', 'Christians', 'are', 'maliciously', 'being', 'slaughtered', 'Historically', 'feeding-the-Christians-to-the-lions', 'motif', 'right', 'emperor', 'Galerius', 'ruled', '305-311', 'A.D.', 'shortly', 'Constantine', 'ascended', 'throne', 'Christian', 'persecution', 'was', 'height', 'untrue', 'Constantine', 'slew', 'lions', 'save', 'Christians', 'arena', 'scene', 'nevertheless', 'excellent', 'depiction', 'incidents', 'really', 'really', 'notable', 'quality', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'major', 'historical', 'happenings', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'Diocletian', 'Maximian', 'really', 'did', 'abdicate', 'throne', '308', 'also', 'true', 'mother', 'Helena', 'was', 'Christian', 'details', 're', 'relationship', 'w/her', 'movie', 'are', 'fictional', 'did', 'marry', 'Fausta', 'had', 'eldest', 'son', 'Crispus', 'put', 'death', 'treason', '326', 'long', 'time', 'period', 'covered', 'movie', 'inclusion', 'Constantine', 'quot', 'vision', 'quot', 'battle', 'Maxentius', 'essential', 'perhaps', 'one', 'defining', 'moments', 'entire', 'history', 'Christianity', 'actual', 'battle', 'also', 'given', 'accurate', 'treatment', 'Maxentius', 'cavalry', 'was', 'ambushed', 'trapped', 'Constantine', 'forces', 'just', 'film', 'claims.Now', 'bad', 'news', 'found', 'acting', 'females', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'male', 'actors', 'were', 'stilted', 'overly-dramatic', 'amp', 'pretty', 'much', 'downright', 'awful', 'quality', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'scratches', 'skips', 'are', 'amplified', 'DVD', 'picture.All', 'film', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'However', 'well', 'time', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'Roman', 'history', 'world', 'history', 'history', 'Christianity']",Constantine and The Cross

515887,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B000034DE2,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I really wanted to like this film - but I simply couldn't. Below, some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.First, the technical aspects. This is a very bad transfer from a clearly very heavily used tape. Both images and sound are of rather poor quality. Also, this film was initially turned in Italian and English dubbing is par moments ATROCIOUS! But all of that would be secondary, if the film was good - but it is not...Now, being Christian myself I was very eager to watch the only (to my knowledge) film about Constantine the Great (272-337, Roman Emperor 306 to 337) and especially the miraculous event which occurred in 312 when following a prophetic dream this young emperor decided to adopt Christian cross as the sign of his army for the incoming decisive battle before the walls of Rome. Constantine's life and adventures before he became emperor in 306 are already a great tale, but everything what happened after is even more incredible - sometimes even stranger than things we can see in ""Game of Thrones""... But for some reason, there is only one film telling this story - and to my considerable regret it tells this story poorly.Although the real story of Constantine's life was extremely interesting, here director and scenarist managed to make it into a standard-issue peplum, with incredibly stereotyped characters: noble and generous Constantine, villainous treacherous Maxentius, brave heroic sidekick Hadrian, virginally immaculate young Christian Livia (played by German actress Christine Kaufmann - who was once Tony Curtis wife - lucky b@st@rd!), etc. etc. The only little touch of originality comes from the character of Fausta, Constantine's wife (and Maxentius sister!) played by sculpturally beautiful Belinda Lee (who tragically died in a car accident immediately after this film was finished). Everything here is predictable, dialogs are lame and we heard them all one thousand times before, all form of humor is missing in action, etc. etc.Fighting scenes are also the same thing we saw a thousand of times. There are however some unwillingly funny moments - when at one moment a Roman general dies in battle, well, even if this is not the most ridiculous scene I ever saw, it definitely must qualify into the Top 5...))) Also, at one moment it really becomes amusing how all Romans wear armor (helmets included!) everywhere and for every occasion...))) And finally, the scene of the ""Miracle of the Cross"" and the key moments which follow are shown in such a lame way, with Cornel Wilde giving such a wooden, tired, unconvincing ""I am saying this just because they made me - I do not believe one word of it - but if I do not play the script I will be fired"" way, that at that moment I really felt sorry that I forced myself to watch this film...The only reason I give to this film two stars instead of one are two scenes of Christian persecutions. They are pretty strong and they give a good idea of the horrors inflicted by pagan Romans to the first Christians - honestly those two scenes shocked me greatly... And I do not think I will ever be able to laugh again at any jokes about Christians and lions...Bottom line, this is a bad film and watching it is mostly a loss of time. And it is a pity. I do not think I will keep this DVD for any future viewings. And I really, sincerely hope one day somebody will make a super production about Constantine the Great and the ""Miracle of the Cross"" thanks to which Roman Empire became Christian which allowed Christianity to spread (much) later to other continents - and make world a better place.

515888,AAW58LG72PG7I,B000034DE2,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[4, 5]","In CONSTANTINE AND THE CROSS director Lionello de Felice brings to the screen a period of time in Western history that is much misunderstood and even less recognized in history texts.  The Roman Empire in the early 300s was a strange and unwieldy quilt of multi emperors all of whom ruled various subsets of what had once been a unified empire.  There was an emperor for the Eastern provinces and another for the western.  And in both there was a sort of junior emperor called a caesar.  Cornell Wilde is Constantine, son of one of these caesars.  His father is killed in battle, and Constantine is soon elevated to the emperorship as a result of a smashing victory over a barbarian army.  The film is historically accurate in many areas, but suffers from an inexcusably poor job of transferral to DVD which includes blotches and blips aplenty. De Felice captures the historical sweep of events that must have seemed confusing even to contemporaries but due to a deft hand behind the camera never manages to lose the interest of the viewer.Wilde begins the film as a hothead, who seems to be unwilling to heed the advice of his caesar father.  As event follows event, we can see his slow maturation on several levels.  As he moves to Rome to get embroiled in the power struggle that will later elevate him to emperor, Wilde becomes more astute as one who gets on the job practice as a young emperor to be.  He meets and later marries Fausta, fetchingly played by Belinda Lee, who in real life died in a car accident just a few months before the film was released. Fausta is a woman who is torn between her love for Constantine and her knowledge that her brother and he must soon collide in a lethal duel for the crown.  The film has several dramatic highlights. The much discussed scene of the moon morphing into a cross stands out. Further, De Felice had to stretch a tight budget so that a few hundred extras could sub for the tens of thousands that were seen in other films like Ben Hur and Spartacus.  The film does not mention that in real life Constantine executed Fausta for fear that she had cuckolded him with a son from a prior marriage. The historical Constantine is mostly remembered as the first Roman emperor who made Christianity as the empire's official religion. Wilde is convincing as a ruler who slowly comes to value acknowledging a faith that places peace over mindless war.  CONSTANTINE AND THE CROSS is one of those rare films that entertains even as it instructs. It succeeds well enough for one to overlook the admitted flaws.

515889,A2L1IQXXDUNT2,B000034DE2,"Mr. David Rayner ""David Rayner""","[13, 14]","I ran this film (which was called CONSTANTINE THE GREAT here in the UK)in May, 1963, when I was a cinema projectionist. At the time, Italian historical spectaculars were very much the in thing, just as spaghetti Westerns would be a few years later. At the time, I thought it was quite good and a more elaborate example of the genre and particularly liked Mario Nascimbene's score. Looked at today, however, over forty years later, I have to agree with the sentiments expressed by the above reviewer. Despite amazon.com saying the film is in black and white, it's actually in Eastmancolor and TotalScope, an Italian form of CinemaScope. Unfortunately, this video transfer is one of the worst I have ever seen of a Scope film and whoever at VCI Home Video is responsible for it should be sacked. The ratio is all wrong and the anamorphic film has been transferred to video semi-squeezed, so that all the characters look tall and thin. It hurts your eyes after a while. The 35mm copy it was transferred to video from is a badly worn original exhibition print and full of splices, especially at the beginning and end of each reel, with scratched in queu marks jumping about all over the place.

Crawford,"[13, 20]","Constantine was as cold as they come:  a shrewd and ruthless manipulator of power, he never hesitated to massacre his adversaries without even the appearance of honor or scruple.  This  portrays him as a heathen with a conscience,  who from observation and conviction is converted to Christianity.  In the end, according to the film, he established religious tolerance for the first time in the Roman Empire.  This is very close to the ""official version"" - Christianity was in fact persecuted in Rome because it denied others (and esp. the patron gods of the city) any validity whatsoever (afterall, it was monotheistic and messianic).  Rome, before Christianity, was one of the most tolerant societies in religion as well as morals that had ever existed to then.That being said, this a very good dramatic film.  You see a Constantine who struggles both within himself and against psychopathic seekers of power.  His righthand man, Hadrian, falls for a Christian girl, and is converted. Constantine resolved a great personal conflict that defined his life, which is a spoiler if revealed in detail, and receives a religious vision that enables him to win an unlikely victory.While I disagree with the historical perspective, this really is a fun film.

While this early 1960's Italian produced epic does play around heavily with historical fact, in particular with the details of Constantine's personal life and character, it does however make an earnest attempt to retell many of the significant historical moments in the period of Constantine's battle to become sole emperor of the crumbling Roman Empire in the 4th century A.D. For this kind of production which enjoyed great popularity in the early 1960's ""Constantine and the Cross"", is an elaborate entry and benefits from the presense of American actor Cornel Wilde who takes the lead roel of Constantine and does bear a good resemblance to the Emperor from the statues preserved from his time.

There is a good amount of Roman battle scenes (Civil war). A very small part of the movie is also taken up fighting the barbarians.However, it is a good example of just what Christian Martyrs by the tens of thousands had to endure (death) before Constantine came on the scene. Some here say that it is not factual. Yet evidence from antiquity is strong that Constantine did have a conversion due to divine intervention. He was alone among emperors to fight for religious freedom.  Constantine did not convert immediately after seeing the cross in the sky. But the stage was set.  His mother (Helena/to Catholics: St Helena) is portrayed very well in this movie.In this movie, I was glad to see that we see in the Christians of the time, a sincere, unwavering love for Christ.
