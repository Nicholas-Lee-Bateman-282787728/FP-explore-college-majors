1427552,A2AOUHBZ1HXO5D,B004SYA84M,Avantel,"[0, 0]","Incredibly so, after about a century of movies production ""Norwegian Wood"" might be the first one that realistically shows human sexuality by focusing on its problems and deviations. Virtually all movies flat out ignore the prosaic but still severe pains of human sexuality by portraying it as something too easy to do and enjoy anywhere, in private and public (in an elevator, in shopping malls' dressing rooms, behind restaurant tables, etc.). Those scenes have been a male perspective, we -men- reach orgasm far easier than women, and even then movies have far exaggerated its easiness. And by those mean they have severely distorted the sexual expectations of whole generations starting in their youth (along with parents who couldn't tell their children that the media was lying to them)This is the first movie showing me a female perspective by focusing a lot on the character Naoko, her trauma and struggle to enjoy sexual pleasure. There are many ideas about how much of such pleasure women need, but it's a fact that sex is a rather frequent problem in many relations (maybe in most, but it's kept hidden) everywhere literally and also fact that many men may go insane without such pleasure. This was Naoko's situation, indeed.It should be a scandal that it's been only until now that one director bothered to approach this issue. Ultimately, movie directors mostly follow the crowds. Right here, it's only me pointing Naoko's frigidity. Everyone else has focused in the same old, same old topic in almost all fiction works: death, death, death and some additional comments on the movie's sexiness, smartness, and the like in this much ignored movie. Well, you'll get to see a corpse here, happy?The movie surely has more characters and topics, still revolving around sex. This is not a XXX movie at all, though; don't expect many racy scenes. But many of the soul-feeding landscapes scenes might make up for it (at least they did for me). It was comforting that virtually all of the characters were rather plain looking rather than the typical very handsome actors that movies show.",5,A Much Needed Approach to Reality (about time!!),1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,2092,"['Incredibly', 'so', 'century', 'movies', 'production', 'Norwegian', 'Wood', 'might', 'be', 'first', 'one', 'realistically', 'human', 'sexuality', 'focusing', 'problems', 'deviations', 'Virtually', 'movies', 'flat', 'out', 'ignore', 'prosaic', 'still', 'severe', 'pains', 'human', 'sexuality', 'portraying', 'something', 'too', 'easy', 'do', 'enjoy', 'anywhere', 'private', 'public', 'elevator', 'shopping', 'malls', 'dressing', 'rooms', 'restaurant', 'tables', 'etc.', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'male', 'perspective', '-men-', 'reach', 'orgasm', 'far', 'easier', 'women', 'even', 'then', 'movies', 'have', 'far', 'exaggerated', 'easiness', 'mean', 'have', 'severely', 'distorted', 'sexual', 'expectations', 'whole', 'generations', 'starting', 'youth', 'parents', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'children', 'media', 'was', 'lying', 'first', 'movie', 'showing', 'female', 'perspective', 'focusing', 'lot', 'character', 'Naoko', 'trauma', 'struggle', 'enjoy', 'sexual', 'pleasure', 'are', 'many', 'ideas', 'how', 'much', 'such', 'pleasure', 'women', 'need', 'fact', 'sex', 'rather', 'frequent', 'problem', 'many', 'relations', 'maybe', 'most', 'kept', 'hidden', 'everywhere', 'literally', 'also', 'fact', 'many', 'men', 'may', 'go', 'insane', 'such', 'pleasure', 'was', 'Naoko', 'situation', 'indeed.It', 'should', 'be', 'scandal', 'been', 'only', 'now', 'one', 'director', 'bothered', 'approach', 'issue', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'directors', 'mostly', 'follow', 'crowds', 'Right', 'here', 'only', 'pointing', 'Naoko', 'frigidity', 'Everyone', 'else', 'focused', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'topic', 'almost', 'fiction', 'death', 'death', 'death', 'additional', 'comments', 'movie', 'sexiness', 'smartness', 'like', 'much', 'ignored', 'movie', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'get', 'see', 'corpse', 'here', 'happy', 'movie', 'surely', 'more', 'characters', 'topics', 'still', 'revolving', 'sex', 'not', 'XXX', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'many', 'racy', 'scenes', 'many', 'soul-feeding', 'landscapes', 'scenes', 'might', 'make', 'up', 'least', 'did', 'was', 'comforting', 'virtually', 'characters', 'were', 'rather', 'plain', 'looking', 'rather', 'typical', 'very', 'handsome', 'actors', 'movies', 'show']",2010 Japanese Movie : Norwegian Wood w/ English Subtitle

Toru&#8217;s best friend commits suicide (we don&#8217;t know why) and he is devastated but moves on and goes to college. One day he runs into Naoka who is his best friend&#8217;s ex-girlfriend. They start seeing each other and have sex. Toru finds that Naoka is a virgin and is shocked that she didn&#8217;t have sex with his best friend before. Naoka is upset by the comment and disappears after the night. Weeks later Toru finds out that Naoka is at a sanitarium, they write letters, and soon he visits her. Her mental issues are complex and she is staying at the sanitarium long term, and wants Toru to wait for her. He agrees, but he soon falls for another girl at school. They have a platonic relationship because he wants to be faithful to Naoka. I want to point out that one of the turn offs is the overdone emotional responses. The sex scene between Naoka and Toru was not graphic but it had enough moaning for a porn film. More awkward than authentic. Eventually Naoka commits suicide and he gets with the new girl and his life moves on even tho he loses two people in his life. End of story. If the auteur focused less on making it dramatic and kept it lighter I think it would have been a better movie.

1427555,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004SYA84M,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 10]","Bringing Haruki Murakami's complex and haunting novel ""Norwegian Wood"" to the screen was probably not an easy task. The book's success had as much to do with (if not more) the poetry of the prose, the creation of a mood. Stylistically, it's a movie that arrives with great expectations. I'm pleased to say that Tran Ahn Hung's melancholy interpretation captures much of the feel of the book and is visually arresting. It is really quite beautiful. Despite its strengths, however, it may not be entirely successful as a stand-alone work. The movie alternately feels intimate AND aloof, filled with passion AND dry in the telling. Every time I felt disconnected with the characters, a moment of brilliance would sweep me back into the story. And every time I was wholeheartedly invested, the narrative reverted to a chilly detachment. In many ways, I'll say that admired ""Norwegian Wood"" more than I loved it. But it is still a recommendation for what it does well, it does very very well.At heart, ""Norwegian Wood"" is a study of loss, coping, and survival. Its characters are irrevocably affected by death and the movie seems to be a lyrical dance with sadness and impending despair. Set in Tokyo of the 1960s, we meet a young man who has escaped his small town existence. He meets a fragile young woman he hasn't seen for years. She was the girlfriend of his best childhood buddy, and the two share an intimacy due to that character's suicide years before. As he tries to navigate his journey into adulthood (his college roommate is a huge influence) he is torn between his current life with new relationships and the troubled girl with whom he shares a past. By commingling themes of death and sex, the screenplay is filled with raw emotion and candor. And there are certainly images and sequences within ""Norwegian Wood"" that will stick with me.On the plus side, the film has several incredibly strong elements. Rinko Kikuchi (Oscar nominee for Babel) is stunning and tragic as the object of our hero's affection. The film, from a technical standpoint, is absolutely lovely. The shot compositions, cinematography, and eclectic score help transport the story to the realm of visual poetry. If for no other reason, this makes the film an easy recommendation for arthouse audiences. But as I said, the tone is a bit uneven. In the first hour of the film, we actually get to know very little about the central characters. Some of the peripheral characters are never explored with much depth either, but act as narrative catalysts more than as fully formed individuals. But when the two leads are together, the movie soars to emotional heights that are touching and disturbing. Not a perfect adaptation or a perfect film, ""Norwegian Wood"" is still a fascinating contemplation of difficult topics.

The setting of Japan in the 60s as well as the cultural web of interactions from a student's perspective were definitely interesting.

The director did an amazing job with the emotional scenes between individuals with wonderful close-ups of faces as well as (quite often) haunting backdrops of nature revolving through the seasons. I thought the film was quite enchanting in its own unique fashion depicting the complex path of finding one's way through the maze of attachments and deep connections in the maelstrom of humanity.

1427559,A3BVHPDNG36WO1,B004SYA84M,"Phillip Royer ""sitenoise""","[3, 4]","I let myself get over-hyped about this one: Director Anh Hung Tran's ""The Vertical Ray of the Sun"" is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen; Cinematographer Mark Ping Bin Lee, one of my favorite; Jonny Greenwood doing the soundtrack, cool. Almost every publicity blurb about this movie starts off with ""Upon hearing the song 'Norwegian Wood', Toru remembers back to his life in the 1960s ..."" Well ... that blurb may describe the book but it has nothing to do with this film. I carry a bunch of love for that song and it does bring with it a great sense of nostalgia. Somebody paid somebody a bunch of money to play that song over the end credits, that's all. There isn't any real sense of nostalgia in the film except for some of the fashion and the big telephones.Greenwood's soundtrack might be interesting to listen to by itself but in the film all the lilting strings sound bombastic. I literally muted the film several times it annoyed me so much. I don't think this is Greenwood's problem, though. Tran has been known to over-saturate a film or two with torturing soundtracks (The Scent of Green Papaya, I'm looking at you). Ping Bin Lee did come through. There are many breathtakingly beautiful scenes in the film, a few of which played silently for me because of the soundtrack's habit of stomping all over the film.I'm not a fan Rinko Kikuchi's acting, Babel notwithstanding. I've seen her in a handful of films and while she gets some moments right, she often brings too much of her international star self to roles (even before she had it, which is an achievement) and I struggle to see a character beyond her personality. She whispers a lot, which is a phony way to be dramatic used by people, strangely, desirous of attention. Fortunately she is only half the focus of the film. Texas born Kiko Mizuhara is awesome as the main ""other"" girl, Midori, in Toru's life. She's cute, spunky, forward, sexually confident and blunt, but comes off as merely an outline of a character. I wish the whole film were about her. Ken'ichi Matsuyama, as Toru, is serviceable as the supposedly nostalgic one but hardly awesome enough to be a guy that three different girls just have to sleep with. Gorgeous Eriko Hatsune has a nearly film-stealing scene but that's all we see of her.The film contains some rather bold, and funny at the same time, sexual dialog. I loved it and laughed when Midori calls up Toru and says ""My dad died. Will you take me to a porno film? The most perverse one."" She also has a few moments describing to Toru how she'd like to be bedded by him, which are entertaining. Kikuchi's Naoko, after letting Toru know that she's too crazy with despair to sleep with him asks him if it's torture to have an unserviced erection: ""I can help with that"", she then inexplicably offers. There is a good bit of sadness and mixed up desire in the film but the characters and the story aren't developed enough to see it as more than young angst.I think this film will appeal to teenagers and twenty-somethings who've read the Haruki Murakami novel because most of the holes in the film will be filled in and a sense of nostalgia might be there. Not that teenagers have a lot of nostalgia for the sixties but the film is about loss, and the film is fairly good at presenting that---except the adolescent level of it is pretty thin. The film is NOT about the way things were---the last few wonderful lines of the film and a Beatles tune can't save it. It's just a young-love story which lacks the depth to appeal to those not feeling the same way already. Young people experiencing the whirlwind of sexual awakening, and/or those who've had a friend commit suicide, will love it.Norwegian Wood is a great looking film but not very well written or acted, and since it is also quite slow moving I don't think it will engage general audiences who haven't read the book.

Due to loyalty to his friends, he almost forgoes any chance for his own happiness. It is well worth watching and the music (somewhat quirky, which is not unusual for an Anh Hung Tran film) and cinematography are excellent. However, you may have to watch this alone if you need the subtitles, or don't have a friend that likes dark movies. I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if I was able.
