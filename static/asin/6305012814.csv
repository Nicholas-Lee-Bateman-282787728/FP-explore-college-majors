443939,A18BD98SU49UB7,6305012814,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[1, 1]","Mel Gibson stars as a man who is hiding from a past that haunts him. In this, his directoral debut, he displayed that he was serious about his new found profession and announced that he was here to stay. Nick Stahl star's as a young boy with darkness in his own past. After having trouble at school, he gathers up all of the bravery he can muster to ask the reclusive hermit, known to the locals as ""Hamburger Head"", if he will help him with his school work. After much hesitation, Mcleod (Gibson) gives in. The first lesson he gives the boy is digging a hole, and you can guess how much the boy likes that.The Man without a Face explores the deep relationship that can be shared after a man has been hurt, and a boy looses his father. Both of them have secrets, and both quickly develop a bond. Its one of Gibson's finest movies.The only problem I had with the movie, was the predictable situation that the movie places Gibson and the Boy in near the end. I don't want to spoil it, but it would have been more enjoyable and less formulaic if they hadn't gone in that direction. Besides that small detail, all of the plot surrounding the incident is terrific, worth your time, and your tissues. If you want to study Nick Stahl in his other movies, he can be found in MTV'S ""Wasted"", and the great shocker ""Bully"". Also, he has a cameo (like everybody else) in ""The Thin Red Line.""",4,The Outcast,1018828800,"04 15, 2002",2002,1380,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'man', 'who', 'hiding', 'past', 'directoral', 'debut', 'displayed', 'was', 'serious', 'new', 'found', 'profession', 'announced', 'was', 'here', 'stay', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'star', 'young', 'boy', 'darkness', 'own', 'past', 'having', 'trouble', 'school', 'up', 'bravery', 'can', 'muster', 'ask', 'reclusive', 'hermit', 'known', 'locals', 'Hamburger', 'Head', 'will', 'help', 'school', 'work', 'much', 'hesitation', 'Mcleod', 'Gibson', 'first', 'lesson', 'boy', 'digging', 'hole', 'can', 'guess', 'how', 'much', 'boy', 'that.The', 'Man', 'Face', 'deep', 'relationship', 'can', 'be', 'shared', 'man', 'been', 'hurt', 'boy', 'father', 'have', 'secrets', 'quickly', 'develop', 'bond', 'one', 'Gibson', 'finest', 'movies.The', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'predictable', 'situation', 'movie', 'places', 'Gibson', 'Boy', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'less', 'formulaic', 'had', ""n't"", 'gone', 'direction', 'small', 'detail', 'plot', 'surrounding', 'incident', 'terrific', 'time', 'tissues', 'want', 'study', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'other', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'MTV', 'Wasted', 'great', 'shocker', 'Bully', 'Also', 'cameo', 'everybody', 'else', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line']",The Man Without A Face VHS

He looks a lot like Mel Gibson. But the right side, including the ear and hair, has been horribly burned and scarred. His name is Justin McLeod, but the local kids call him all sorts of horrible names. He lives alone and avoids other people for the obvious reasons.Chuck Norstadt (Nick Stahl) is a lonely 10-year-old who lives with his much-married mother, his older half-sister and his younger half-sister. It's quite the dysfunctional family, and Mom is busy working up to her fourth or fifth marriage. Older sister Gloria simply hates Chuck, calls him a freak and stupid and all sorts of things. His younger sister Megan likes him well enough, but is enough smarter than he is that she humiliates him.Chuck flunked the exam to get admitted to his father's old prep school, a military academy which I'm thinking is for Navy, but not sure there. So he's determined to study Latin and geometry over the summer so he can take the exam again at the end of the summer. Mom doesn't like the idea, but acquiesces.Chuck accidentally discovers that McLeod is or was a teacher, and persuades him to tutor him in Latin and geometry. That's the center of the story, and I'm not going to spoil it with more detail than that.One face you may recognize: Gloria's boyfriend is played by Michael DeLuise, who was Joey Penhall on 21 Jump Street.

I read the description and decided to give this film a chance.  Though the nearly 2 hour film starts slow, I continued to watch.  Set in the late 1960's, the injustice served in this film is probably even more so in today's society.  Intolerable justice which leads to a painful closing; maybe bittersweet for others.  No tears, just pain.  Like other films I have watched and in some cases reviewed (watch L.I.E. or Eban and Charley for alternate viewpoints and storylines), this one deals with the bond between a man and a young boy - in this case, a boy seeking the guidance, knowledge and friendship of someone older and wiser.  The child, Charlie is from a broken family (divorced mother, nagging sisters and an alcoholic father now deceased), Charlie seeks a way to gain acceptance into a boarding school.  In doing so, he seeks out and befriends a disfigured man (played by Mel Gibson).  As mentioned, a slow start that keeps you tuned in and eventually has you hooked.  The ending hurts, and shows us once against how bigotry and circumstance continue to shield justice on our country - then, as it does now.  I would rather not share the twisted plot that results.  I would refer to this film as a sleeper, and one I very much enjoyed, and yet knew nothing about before watching.NOTE: After writing this review, I received an email from an avid reader (of which I am not).  I have since learned the the film adaption of the book is NOT a true portrayal.  In the book, the disfigured character was, in fact, gay.  He & the teenager have a sexual relationship (although it is only tastefully referred to & not depicted).  Based on this blatant change of context, Mr. Gibson apparently was more interested in making big Hollywood money, or has some personal issues with the story line...I'm sure that is the subject of forums elsewhere.

443947,AKTQOJG1NFHM1,6305012814,"Charles D. Blanchard ""Novelist""","[0, 0]","Young Charles is the only boy who lives with his step family of females consisting of his step mother and step sisters in a quaint village in Maine in the 1960s. It is clear from the beginning of the film that the step family does not understand nor appreciate Charles's presence and as a result he longs to get out and one way is to attend his father's old boarding school. But first he has to pass the entrance exam.In this quest, he comes across a disfigured former college professor, Justin McLeod played by Mel Gibson who lives alone in a large lake house and avoids people at every turn. Charles invites himself to be tutored by the professor in preparation for the exam as there is no one else to tutor him and therefore its the only option if he wants to take the exam.  The professor reluctantly agrees. Instead of payment for tutoring the boy, the professor makes Charles work around the house while he teaches him latin, geometry and Shakespeare.Charles is intrigued by the professor and his disfigurement. Over time Charles becomes acquainted with the professor and learns about the auto accident that disfigured him.  As the two begin to share interests in the arts a friendship develops. Charles comes to understand that for the first time in his young life, he has found someone to love. Charles begins to see the shallowness of his step family and his friends around him as they formulate opinions about the professor based on impressions and hearsay. Charles does not tell his step mother he is being tutored by the hermit like professor that people have learned to stay away from.It is only by chance that the boy is discovered hiking in the woods with the professor by a police officer and then the trouble starts for Justin McLeod. The step mother insists on an inquiry as to what if anything was going on between her stepson and the professor. We learn later that apparantly there was a boy about Charles's age who died in the crash that disfigured the professor's face and the professor was accused of molesting the boy but it was never proven.The moral of the story is that for seven years Justin McLeod lived alone in that big house with his faithful dog and never bothered anyone. When he decided to get involved in another young man's life his world suddenly was intruded on but in a positive way for he made a friend but the punishment for that friendship based on his past was that the court decided he was not to see the boy ever again for the peace of mind of everyone.This was Mel Gibson's first film as both star and director. He is terrific in conveying the essense of a man who has been rejected by the world and who has come to terms with that rejection by embracing his solitude. The supporting cast includes a very young Nick Stahl as Charles.  This is simply one of those feel good movies that include This Boy's Life and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, all produced the same year 1993 that are quite simply enjoyable for the performances, and are photographed well and each scene is rich with excellent writing that conveys the greatest of all attributes in any medium, the human condition.Charles Blanchardauthor of Mourning Doves After The Fire",4,Mel Gibson's First Directorial Effort,1306368000,"05 26, 2011",2011,3182,"['Young', 'Charles', 'only', 'boy', 'who', 'step', 'family', 'females', 'consisting', 'step', 'mother', 'step', 'sisters', 'quaint', 'village', 'Maine', '1960s', 'clear', 'beginning', 'film', 'step', 'family', 'not', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'Charles', 'presence', 'result', 'get', 'out', 'one', 'way', 'attend', 'father', 'old', 'boarding', 'school', 'first', 'pass', 'entrance', 'exam.In', 'quest', 'disfigured', 'former', 'college', 'professor', 'Justin', 'McLeod', 'played', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'who', 'alone', 'large', 'lake', 'house', 'avoids', 'people', 'turn', 'Charles', 'be', 'tutored', 'professor', 'preparation', 'exam', 'one', 'else', 'tutor', 'therefore', 'only', 'option', 'take', 'exam', 'professor', 'reluctantly', 'Instead', 'payment', 'tutoring', 'boy', 'professor', 'Charles', 'work', 'around', 'house', 'latin', 'geometry', 'Shakespeare.Charles', 'intrigued', 'professor', 'disfigurement', 'time', 'Charles', 'becomes', 'acquainted', 'professor', 'auto', 'accident', 'disfigured', 'two', 'begin', 'share', 'interests', 'arts', 'friendship', 'Charles', 'understand', 'first', 'time', 'young', 'life', 'found', 'someone', 'love', 'Charles', 'see', 'shallowness', 'step', 'family', 'friends', 'around', 'formulate', 'opinions', 'professor', 'based', 'impressions', 'hearsay', 'Charles', 'not', 'tell', 'step', 'mother', 'being', 'tutored', 'hermit', 'professor', 'people', 'have', 'learned', 'stay', 'away', 'from.It', 'only', 'chance', 'boy', 'discovered', 'hiking', 'woods', 'professor', 'police', 'officer', 'then', 'trouble', 'Justin', 'McLeod', 'step', 'mother', 'inquiry', 'what', 'anything', 'was', 'going', 'stepson', 'professor', 'learn', 'later', 'apparantly', 'was', 'boy', 'Charles', 'age', 'who', 'died', 'crash', 'disfigured', 'professor', 'face', 'professor', 'was', 'accused', 'molesting', 'boy', 'was', 'never', 'proven.The', 'moral', 'story', 'seven', 'years', 'Justin', 'McLeod', 'lived', 'alone', 'big', 'house', 'faithful', 'dog', 'never', 'bothered', 'anyone', 'When', 'decided', 'get', 'involved', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'world', 'suddenly', 'was', 'intruded', 'positive', 'way', 'made', 'friend', 'punishment', 'friendship', 'based', 'past', 'was', 'court', 'decided', 'was', 'not', 'see', 'boy', 'ever', 'again', 'peace', 'mind', 'everyone.This', 'was', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'first', 'film', 'star', 'director', 'terrific', 'conveying', 'essense', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'rejected', 'world', 'who', 'come', 'terms', 'rejection', 'embracing', 'solitude', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'young', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'Charles', 'simply', 'one', 'feel', 'good', 'movies', 'include', 'Boy', 'Life', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'produced', 'same', 'year', '1993', 'are', 'quite', 'simply', 'enjoyable', 'performances', 'are', 'photographed', 'well', 'scene', 'rich', 'excellent', 'writing', 'greatest', 'attributes', 'medium', 'human', 'condition.Charles', 'Blanchardauthor', 'Mourning', 'Doves', 'Fire']",The Man Without A Face VHS

443949,A2VP31U48VZUOZ,6305012814,"E. Marin ""voracious reader""","[20, 24]","Mel Gibson does justice to a wonderful story (based on the novel by Isabelle Holland) in &quot;The Man Without a Face,&quot; his directorial debut.  Commonly underrated as an actor because of his good looks and blockbuster action hits, Gibson is also terrific as the scarred recluse Justin McLeod, cantankerous and charismatic by turns.  Like his student, Chuck (Nick Stahl), we notice the terrible burns less and less as the friendship between the boy and his tutor develops, as we penetrate the surface to the beauty beneath.  (By the way, as one reviewer noted, only one half of McLeod's face has been disfigured - the title refers, not to McLeod, but to Chuck's absent father.)I do wonder why Gibson chose to eliminate the homoerotic overtones in their relationship - in the novel, Chuck's yearning for a genuine father figure is inextricably entangled with his confusion regarding his sexual identity and attraction to his tutor, and these twin needs force the dramatic climax that ends their time together.  Perhaps Gibson preferred to keep the plot simpler, concentrating on the themes of prejudice, the joy of teaching, and the friendship and platonic love that his protagonists learn from each other.

443953,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6305012814,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 3]","That's a strange film indeed. The situation is not innocuous, far from it. It cannot be considered as being a simple emotional or sentimental film, not even a social film. The stake is a lot more than that. It is a cultural film, a film about a whole culture that is being stifled, destroyed just out of bigotry, the culture of the male maturation of boys. Not even the sexual bigotry that is actually brandished to justify the rejection, and that's why it is not social or sentimental or even emotional. It is as cold as cold can be and purely cultural. It is dealing with the fundamental freedom of any child, of any man, of any woman, to dominate their lives, to choose what they want to do, who they want to love and even the way they want to love them. And the stake in the film is not even that last element since there is absolutely not one single little iota of sexuality, not even understood innuendo, between the man wand the boy. The only sexuality is between two heterosexual teenagers who are not of age. But why is that man rejected, why is that boy oppressed into severing his friendship from that man? The reasons are as ugly as any bigotry can be. First the bigotry of both men and women against any man who is not married and the father of several children. When we know the strongest criticism comes from the sheriff - whose mission that over-protective and slandering attitude may be - and from the mother who has three children from three different fathers and is raising that boy in an all-female environment with the introduction of a fourth man, husband, or whatever, to soon bring in another child probably, at least a development that might be satisfying for the mother's impulses, maybe for the daughters' impulses too who are more or less their own bosses and authorities, but a development that can only be disruptive for the son who is in that fragile moment when he needs some stability, a male presence and certainly not a mother who is multiplying her sexual partners. This film is thus a denunciation of the society that enables a mother and a sheriff to frustrate a young male teenager of the only friendly male presence he has managed to develop himself. This frustrating attitude is castrating in many ways too. And what's more it is vain because no one can get a teenager to reject and forget that friendship of his and the man will be there when he graduates, even if at a certain distance. But why is that bigotry so violent and ruthless? Mel Gibson makes it a lot more effective by making it the result of his deformed and disfigured face that was burned severely in a car accident in which a child, who was not the man's, was killed and for which he had spent three years in prison for some kind of accidental manslaughter. The local public opinion transforms it into a sexual crime that cannot be in anyway excused, especially since it never was committed. This duplicity, this obsessive fear from these people is the sign that we are sick and mad in  our own psyches, we, I mean, the normal dominant heterosexual and terroristic moralists.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID.",5,Fate is a curse for the bigots,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,3199,"['strange', 'film', 'indeed', 'situation', 'not', 'innocuous', 'far', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'being', 'simple', 'emotional', 'sentimental', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'social', 'film', 'stake', 'lot', 'more', 'cultural', 'film', 'film', 'whole', 'culture', 'being', 'stifled', 'destroyed', 'just', 'bigotry', 'culture', 'male', 'maturation', 'boys', 'Not', 'even', 'sexual', 'bigotry', 'actually', 'brandished', 'justify', 'rejection', 'why', 'not', 'social', 'sentimental', 'even', 'emotional', 'as', 'cold', 'cold', 'can', 'be', 'purely', 'cultural', 'dealing', 'fundamental', 'freedom', 'child', 'man', 'woman', 'dominate', 'lives', 'choose', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'who', 'want', 'love', 'even', 'way', 'want', 'love', 'stake', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'last', 'element', 'absolutely', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'little', 'iota', 'sexuality', 'not', 'even', 'understood', 'innuendo', 'man', 'wand', 'boy', 'only', 'sexuality', 'two', 'heterosexual', 'teenagers', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'age', 'why', 'man', 'rejected', 'why', 'boy', 'oppressed', 'severing', 'friendship', 'man', 'reasons', 'are', 'as', 'ugly', 'bigotry', 'can', 'be', 'First', 'bigotry', 'men', 'women', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'married', 'father', 'several', 'children', 'When', 'know', 'strongest', 'criticism', 'sheriff', 'mission', 'over-protective', 'slandering', 'attitude', 'may', 'be', 'mother', 'who', 'three', 'children', 'three', 'different', 'fathers', 'raising', 'boy', 'all-female', 'environment', 'introduction', 'fourth', 'man', 'husband', 'whatever', 'soon', 'bring', 'child', 'probably', 'least', 'development', 'might', 'be', 'satisfying', 'mother', 'impulses', 'maybe', 'daughters', 'impulses', 'too', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'own', 'bosses', 'authorities', 'development', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'disruptive', 'son', 'who', 'fragile', 'moment', 'when', 'stability', 'male', 'presence', 'certainly', 'not', 'mother', 'who', 'multiplying', 'sexual', 'partners', 'film', 'thus', 'denunciation', 'society', 'mother', 'sheriff', 'frustrate', 'young', 'male', 'teenager', 'only', 'friendly', 'male', 'presence', 'managed', 'develop', 'frustrating', 'attitude', 'castrating', 'many', 'ways', 'too', 'what', 'more', 'vain', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'teenager', 'reject', 'forget', 'friendship', 'man', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'even', 'certain', 'distance', 'why', 'bigotry', 'so', 'violent', 'ruthless', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'lot', 'more', 'effective', 'making', 'result', 'deformed', 'disfigured', 'face', 'was', 'burned', 'severely', 'car', 'accident', 'child', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'man', 'was', 'killed', 'had', 'spent', 'three', 'years', 'prison', 'kind', 'accidental', 'manslaughter', 'local', 'public', 'opinion', 'transforms', 'sexual', 'crime', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'anyway', 'excused', 'especially', 'never', 'was', 'committed', 'duplicity', 'obsessive', 'fear', 'people', 'sign', 'are', 'sick', 'mad', 'own', 'psyches', 'mean', 'normal', 'dominant', 'heterosexual', 'terroristic', 'moralists.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines', 'CEGID']",The Man Without A Face VHS

443957,ADJXL0W0RJ7VV,6305012814,Lord Chimp,"[28, 28]","Mel Gibson's first time directing is notably successful. The Man Without A Face is warm movie with themes touching prejudice, the relationship between teacher and student, and faces of deception. Chuck Norstadt is a young boy whose mother's capricious relationships have sent her skimming through multiple marriages and developing a considerable deal of tension at home. The dysfunctional family leaves Chuck desperately looking for companionship. He finds an unlikely friend, the town's ""freak,"" Justin McLeod (Gibson), who had half his face horribly scarred in a car accident. McLeod lives in a big house on the coast as a lonely hermit whose past is shrouded in ugly rumors and fear.McLeod becomes Chuck's tutor and his friend, although Chuck will do some teaching of his own. They both realize they have a lot to learn about each other, and their friendship develops into something stirring and honest. Things get complicated when vile rumors and intolerance threaten to separate them, though.The script is smart, and Gibson's direction guides this film with a discerning knack for emotional lucidity and realism. Nick Stahl (as Chuck) is one of the few young actors who can do emotional expression that doesn't seem forced and stupid. This is critical, because bad casting for Chuck would seriously have ruined this movie. Gibson, of course, is great here, but what would you expect? He's a tremendously versatile actor. I do think the movie probably should have been about 10 minutes longer to flesh out the ending a bit. That's not a huge complaint...the last scene in the movie makes up for any disappointment because it is very moving and evocative in its simplicity.

443958,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,6305012814,magellan,"[4, 4]","A surprisingly good movie considering it was Mel Gibson's first directorial effort, and also considering the role required Gibson to obscure his matinee-idol looks and assume the role of a horribly scarred, possibly disreputable outcast in a cliquey, suspicious little Maine coastal town.Nick Stahl as the young boy who befriends Gibson is also terrific in the role. No doubt the kid has a bright future in acting. He is absolutely convincing as the young hopeful pursuing his dream of getting into an exclusive boarding school. His dysfunctional family can only pour cold water on the boy's dreams, and in that sense the two are made for each other--Stahl is an outcast even though surrounded by his own family--and Gibson is already a social outcast who has completely withdrawn from society and is living in mysterious solitude--a solitude no-one has dared intrude upon until Stahl stubbornly refuses to be turned away by Gibson's outwardly gruff exterior.But the two come together when Stahl learns Gibson was a talented teacher once and can tutor him in the subjects he desperately needs to ace the exam into the exclusive boarding school. They overcome their own emotional baggage to forge a working friendship despite their difficulties.Unfortunately, the movie strays off-base for a while with the kangaroo-court scene with the suspicious townies, who still have it in for Gibson, and the final ending is a little too short, but those are my only real criticisms.All in all a very well cast, acted, and scripted film. Big Steve says go see it (or in this case, rent it) and don't Bogart the popcorn.The last thing I wanted to mention is that I wonder if anybody else has noticed the similarity between this film and Stephen Crane's story, ""The Monster?""

I have to complain about my shoddy DVD, as I'm sure it's a pan & scan one, as I could move the screen about, and lose/gain some parts of the scene. Either that or I'm just discovering new buttons to press on my DVD remote.I also love Nick Stahl in this movie, he's not the greatest looking kid to watch (although he's grown up to be quite nice looking), but he draws you into the character, and it's really good to watch.I've always wanted to read the book, but have never found it here in the UK. It sounds very interesting, as Justin McLeod was homosexual in the book, and there is a much bigger relationship than shown in the film - but obviously Mel Gibson didn't want to include this, maybe fearing it would be too much? There are still some undertones of the Chuck's sexuality in the film, but you have to look hard to see them, and maybe read between the lines a bit.I love the whole family around Chuck too, his mum (Margaret Whitton), older sister (Fay Masterson), and younger sister. Gaby Hoffman was brilliant as his young bra-burning, feminist sister, whatever happened to her? She's been in Now & Then, Sleepless in Seattle, this, and then she's disappeared off the face of the earth. She's changed a lot however.There's some shocking scenes in this, including Mel Gibson's topless scene where he shows off his character's burns to their full extent, and the way Justin is treated when the story begins to pick up speed.I never got the start of the movie, which basically opens into a dream, but connects to the scene at the end of the movie. And it was stupid having a completely different looking actor take over Nick Stahl's part at the end of the movie.This is a truly heart wrenching movie, an ending which will have you in tears, and will make you want to read the book, if you can get your hands on it.

443965,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6305012814,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 5]","First-time director Mel Gibson is Justin McLeod, a reclusive somebody or other of a picturesque New England town.  Mcleod has wisdom beyond his years, but disfigurement after a horrific accident has cut him off from the wise, but beautiful inhabitants of his small town.  In the late 1960's, young Charles Norstadt (Nick Stahl) has come here in the tow of his mother and two step-sisters - one a supportive one, the other demanding, malicious and inwardly jealous for the love of their mother, both intellectually above him.  Chuck chafes not only under the bile of sister-Gloria, but also under his mother's drowning love, both of which - he is sure - will rob him of his chance to follow in his late father's vaguely glorious footsteps.  He is actually his own greatest obstacle - more accurately a learning disability that has him look blank-faced through the flick.  Hoping to triumph over the odds, Chuck applies to an exclusive military academy, and turns to McLeod for help in passing the rigorous entry process.  Reluctant to have any contact, McLeod breaks down and not only helps the boy, but shares a confidence which will tie the two and, when Chuck accidentally fails to keep it under wraps, force McLeod back into the open.  It will also force Chuck to examine who his father really was.  While McLeod is merely disfigured, it's Chuck's deceased father who is really faceless victim alluded in the title.  ...For his first directing job, this was actually an exemplary flick, but it suffers because it's not clear who the flick is supposed to be about.  Gibson keeps the focus off of his own character, probably afraid he'd accidentally turn the film into a vanity piece, but he doesn't really beef up Charlie's character either.  Charlie has a low threshold for fear and pain, and he falls into a fugue whenever it's hit (mostly, the film will cut without interval to show Charlie in a trance-like state).  Frankly, I couldn't see the homosexual undertones arising from anything more than the narrow-mindedness of Charlie's self-righteous neighbors.  Surprisingly, the main characters and the script cater shamelessly to such right-wing fantasies as evil, domineering females (Charlie is the sole male in a house of hyper-intelligent women who ruthlessly and callously victimize him, not allowing his attention-deficits to hold them back) while Charlie's mother surrounds herself with wealthy and left-leaning intellectual friends, the very picture of elitist liberals that conservatives love to hate.  The town's upper-crust eastern liberals, though tossing back their martini's with pseudo-intellectual aphorisms about Vietnam and ""imperialistic, post-Hegelian, authoritarian crap"" of the stablishment ruthlessly show their own true face when they realize that McLeod is now a target for suspicion.  The opening scene is a fantasy - of Chuck's triumphant graduation from Military School - one his freely acknowledges as ""John Wayne meets Hugh Hefner"".  Whether you buy into the fantasy or not, it's the only one the script delves into, and it strips of everybody of much of their face.  Charlie himself doesn't so much learn to see the true face of those around him, as have the truth thrust in his face.  It's painful, and a bit of a botch of a movie, but still one you should catch anyway.",4,"Great film, but script is a bit too faceless",1014940800,"03 1, 2002",2002,3308,"['First-time', 'director', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Justin', 'McLeod', 'reclusive', 'somebody', 'other', 'picturesque', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'Mcleod', 'wisdom', 'years', 'disfigurement', 'horrific', 'accident', 'cut', 'off', 'wise', 'beautiful', 'inhabitants', 'small', 'town', 'late', '1960', 'young', 'Charles', 'Norstadt', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'come', 'here', 'tow', 'mother', 'two', 'step-sisters', 'one', 'supportive', 'one', 'other', 'demanding', 'malicious', 'inwardly', 'jealous', 'love', 'mother', 'intellectually', 'Chuck', 'not', 'only', 'bile', 'sister-Gloria', 'also', 'mother', 'drowning', 'love', 'sure', 'will', 'rob', 'chance', 'follow', 'late', 'father', 'vaguely', 'glorious', 'footsteps', 'actually', 'own', 'greatest', 'obstacle', 'more', 'accurately', 'learning', 'disability', 'look', 'blank-faced', 'flick', 'Hoping', 'triumph', 'odds', 'Chuck', 'exclusive', 'military', 'academy', 'McLeod', 'help', 'passing', 'rigorous', 'entry', 'process', 'Reluctant', 'have', 'contact', 'McLeod', 'down', 'not', 'only', 'boy', 'shares', 'confidence', 'will', 'tie', 'two', 'when', 'Chuck', 'accidentally', 'keep', 'wraps', 'force', 'McLeod', 'back', 'open', 'will', 'also', 'force', 'Chuck', 'examine', 'who', 'father', 'really', 'was', 'McLeod', 'merely', 'disfigured', 'Chuck', 'deceased', 'father', 'who', 'really', 'faceless', 'victim', 'alluded', 'title', 'first', 'directing', 'job', 'was', 'actually', 'exemplary', 'flick', 'not', 'clear', 'who', 'flick', 'supposed', 'be', 'about', 'Gibson', 'focus', 'own', 'character', 'probably', 'afraid', ""'d"", 'accidentally', 'turn', 'film', 'vanity', 'piece', ""n't"", 'really', 'beef', 'up', 'Charlie', 'character', 'either', 'Charlie', 'low', 'threshold', 'fear', 'pain', 'fugue', 'whenever', 'hit', 'mostly', 'film', 'will', 'cut', 'interval', 'show', 'Charlie', 'trance-like', 'state', 'Frankly', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'homosexual', 'undertones', 'arising', 'anything', 'more', 'narrow-mindedness', 'Charlie', 'self-righteous', 'neighbors', 'Surprisingly', 'main', 'characters', 'script', 'cater', 'shamelessly', 'such', 'right-wing', 'fantasies', 'evil', 'domineering', 'females', 'Charlie', 'sole', 'male', 'house', 'hyper-intelligent', 'women', 'who', 'ruthlessly', 'callously', 'victimize', 'not', 'allowing', 'attention-deficits', 'hold', 'back', 'Charlie', 'mother', 'wealthy', 'left-leaning', 'intellectual', 'friends', 'very', 'picture', 'elitist', 'liberals', 'love', 'hate', 'town', 'upper-crust', 'eastern', 'liberals', 'tossing', 'back', 'martini', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'aphorisms', 'Vietnam', 'imperialistic', 'post-Hegelian', 'authoritarian', 'crap', 'stablishment', 'ruthlessly', 'show', 'own', 'true', 'face', 'when', 'realize', 'McLeod', 'now', 'target', 'suspicion', 'opening', 'scene', 'fantasy', 'Chuck', 'triumphant', 'graduation', 'Military', 'School', 'one', 'freely', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'Whether', 'buy', 'fantasy', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'script', 'everybody', 'much', 'face', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'learn', 'see', 'true', 'face', 'as', 'have', 'truth', 'thrust', 'face', 'painful', 'bit', 'botch', 'movie', 'still', 'one', 'should', 'catch', 'anyway']",The Man Without A Face VHS

Gibson plays Justin McLeod, a former teacher with a dark past - now a recluse, half of his face disfigured with terrible burns.  The locals in his small town refer to him as &quot;Hamburger Head&quot; and otherwise spin spiteful gossip about him, even though none of them know what they're talking about.  A local Ma &amp; Pa grocer opens for a few hours at night each week, just so he can shop in privacy without people staring or calling him names, but he otherwise keeps to himself and his books.Nick Stahl fabulously portrays Chuck Norstadt, a young kid in a dysfunctional home and with no father. He is naturally curious about McLeod and pesters the former teacher relentlessly until he agrees to tutor him.  McLeod has a soft side, but for the most part, he's all business and is usually brusk with Chuck.Despite the lack of warm fuzzies from McLeod, Chuck prefers his consistent normalcy than his self-centered, bed-hopping mother who says to him, &quot;I'm just not cut out for this mothering racket.&quot; Charming, heh?Chuck proves himself to McLeod by studying his butt off. He works hard and excells in his studies and the two develop respect for each other and a true friendship - and for a time, although it is never openly acknowledged by either of them, Chuck has a a father and McLeod has a son - together they are more of a family than either of them has apart from each other.The local yokels are suspicious about Chuck's relationship with McLeod and suspect that McLeod has less than honorable intentions. Driven by gossip, fear, prejudice and hate, they threaten to ruin the time they have together.The &quot;man without a face&quot; is the father Chuck never got to know - the man with half a face and a full heart is the one he grows to admire and who he aspires to emulate and to make proud.This is a sweet, emotion-filled movie - it is quite amazing that Nick Stahl did not get tons of movie offers after this incredible debut in a major film. It was good to finally see him again in &quot;Terminator 3&quot; where he did another fine job.Family safe, but perhaps too intense and too involved for younger kids, this is a good film to watch together as a family to discuss prejudice and to discuss how hurtful words and gossip can be to other people, irregardless of how tempting gossip tends to be.",5,Gibson's first jab at directing works well,1073520000,"01 8, 2004",2004,2460,"['not', 'easy', 'dance', 'directing', 'movie', 'acting', 'Gibson', 'proved', 'even', 'one', 'butt', 'can', 'dance', 'two', 'weddings', 'Gibson', 'Justin', 'McLeod', 'former', 'teacher', 'dark', 'now', 'recluse', 'half', 'face', 'disfigured', 'terrible', 'burns', 'locals', 'small', 'town', 'refer', 'quot', 'Hamburger', 'Head', 'quot', 'otherwise', 'spin', 'spiteful', 'gossip', 'even', 'none', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'local', 'Ma', 'amp', 'Pa', 'grocer', 'few', 'hours', 'night', 'week', 'just', 'can', 'shop', 'privacy', 'people', 'staring', 'calling', 'names', 'otherwise', 'books.Nick', 'Stahl', 'fabulously', 'Chuck', 'Norstadt', 'young', 'kid', 'dysfunctional', 'home', 'father', 'naturally', 'curious', 'McLeod', 'former', 'teacher', 'relentlessly', 'tutor', 'McLeod', 'soft', 'side', 'most', 'part', 'business', 'usually', 'brusk', 'Chuck.Despite', 'lack', 'warm', 'fuzzies', 'McLeod', 'Chuck', 'consistent', 'normalcy', 'self-centered', 'bed-hopping', 'mother', 'who', 'quot', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'cut', 'out', 'mothering', 'racket.', 'quot', 'Charming', 'heh', 'Chuck', 'McLeod', 'studying', 'butt', 'off', 'hard', 'excells', 'studies', 'two', 'develop', 'respect', 'other', 'true', 'friendship', 'time', 'never', 'openly', 'acknowledged', 'Chuck', 'father', 'McLeod', 'son', 'together', 'are', 'more', 'family', 'apart', 'other.The', 'local', 'yokels', 'are', 'suspicious', 'Chuck', 'relationship', 'McLeod', 'suspect', 'McLeod', 'less', 'honorable', 'intentions', 'Driven', 'gossip', 'fear', 'prejudice', 'hate', 'threaten', 'ruin', 'time', 'have', 'together.The', 'quot', 'man', 'face', 'quot', 'father', 'Chuck', 'never', 'got', 'know', 'man', 'face', 'full', 'heart', 'one', 'admire', 'who', 'emulate', 'make', 'proud.This', 'sweet', 'emotion-filled', 'movie', 'quite', 'amazing', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'tons', 'movie', 'offers', 'incredible', 'debut', 'major', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'finally', 'see', 'again', 'quot', 'Terminator', '3', 'quot', 'where', 'did', 'fine', 'job.Family', 'safe', 'perhaps', 'too', 'intense', 'too', 'involved', 'younger', 'kids', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'together', 'family', 'discuss', 'prejudice', 'discuss', 'how', 'hurtful', 'words', 'gossip', 'can', 'be', 'other', 'people', 'irregardless', 'how', 'tempting', 'gossip', 'be']",The Man Without A Face VHS

The film stars Nick Stahl (in his feature-film acting debut) as Charles ""Chuck"" Norstadt.  Chuck lives in a broken family.  His father died when he was a boy (he doesn't remember how and no one will tell him), he has two half-sisters, and they each have different fathers because his mother has been married and divorced four times.  Charles likes his younger half-sister, but his older half-sister seems to have a deep hatred for him that at times he finds mutual.  Living in a house full of women with no male role model is tough for a boy growing into manhood.  Charles wants out and he is convinced that if he can get into the tough military academy his father went to, it will be his ticket to a better life.  The only problem is that Charles isn't the brightest kid and he's already failed the test once.  His mother gives him one last opportunity to take the test again at the end of summer.  Charles is determined to past the test, but he knows he's going to need help.Charles eventually makes the acquaintance of a disfigured man, Justin McLeod (Mel Gibson) who lives alone at the edge of town.  Rumors abound about the man and Charles has often contributing to the mockery himself.  However, upon learning that McLeod was once a teacher at a prestigious prep school, Charles convinces him to tutor him through the summer so that he can pass his entrance exam.  McLeod begins the tutoring rather reluctantly, but he sees the potential in Chuck and gives him his all.THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE was Mel Gibson's directorial debut.  Gibson did a good job and the experience in the film seems to have been a turning point in Gibson's career.  THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE is a smaller movie, yet it shares many of the same universal themes that Gibson explores in all of his directed feature films (so far) and many of his starring roles since 1993.  The theme that stands out most in the movie is grace.  Towards the end of the movie McLeod tells Charles how he taught him and showed him grace.  Charles' life oozes grace and he doesn't even realize it.  By the same token, McLeod displays grace towards Charles, too.I enjoyed THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE the first time I saw it several years ago.  However, now I enjoy it even more.  When I first saw the film, I identified with Charles, but having returned to school and become a teacher myself, I now relate more to McLeod.  In the movie, their relationship illustrates the type of relationship that should exist between every instructor and pupil, something that happens infrequently in American society.As a side note, I have not read the book that THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE is based upon.  I've been told that the book dabbles with and suggests that the relationship between the two main characters was based on sexuality.  The film does not suggest that at all (though accusations of that sort are key points in the movie) and instead illustrates how a healthy friendship between adults and older children can be.The DVD includes a trailer for the movie as well as a short featurette about the making of the film entitled REMEMBERING THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE.  The featurette is brief, but it includes comments from both Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl discussing how the movie changed their lives.
