467780,A2TVAG2XX0LWIO,6305508550,A. Fierro,"[2, 4]","Office Space was clearly a movie produced for individuals who have ever either worked in an office and those that never have.  Either way, you picked up a paycheck from some scummy employer that probably robbed you each paycheck and you didn't know how to get back at them.  This includes every working adult.If you ever went to work and wanted to impose serious bodily injury on your boss or just wanted to tell them to shove it, this movie is for you.  If you ever drove away from your employer hoping that one day the building you worked in would burn down, this movie is for you.  If you ever wished death on that woman that every single day pissed you for some reason or other, but basically just no reason at all, this movie is for you.  If you ever wanted to just quit your crappy job, but kept on going and then got promoted because of it, this movie is surely for you.Ron Livingston (who plays Peter) performance in this movie was OSCAR worthy.  It transcends the feeling of every working American from the time period that this movie was produced at, set in the 1980's until today (2006).  This movie transcended time and space and I believe will become as important to the fabric of America as the Sound of Music and the Star Wars movies one thru three.  Livingston's simply lays out what every single American office worker has every felt in the history of office work, F the establishment and do it with pride.Having seen this movie numerous times I know where the jokes, but I have yet not to laugh with gusto and amazement how this film portrays the exact feeling of what it is too work in America, both in the 1980's and today.  Regardless of your age, 18 to 88 years old I believe that this movie will bond generations of American workers throughout the centuries for the rest of all our lives.

The protagonist's situation resembles that of Ed Norton's character in the  brilliant Fight Club; both men occupy boring, empty existences framed by  IKEA furniture and jobs of mind-numbing tedium.  However, while Fight Club  quickly veers into new and exciting cinematic territory, Office Space  settles into a formulaic, predictable and utterly inoffensive story about  inept white-collar crime.This isn't a terrible movie and, depite  relying too much on the single most overused comedic topic of prison life,  it does have some funny moments.

Mike Judge even played a part in this movie as Jennifer Aniston's boss.This movie is about a man (Peter) who gets fed up with his job and is sick of wasting his time in an office and he just wants to do what a human is ""meant to do"". Which is nothing. He encourages other workers ( Samir and Michael ) to both do as he does. Eventually they all work together to steal money from the company. The plan backfires, and they decide to pay the money to the company. However, the building burnt down and that was the end of the business. Samir and Michael get new jobs at a similar place, while Peter becomes a construction worker. This is a great movie that has quite a bit of humor, and very good story line.

467786,ABSX5TGEGRH76,6305508550,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[0, 3]","After being pestered my many people for years to see this movie, I have finally gotten around to it.  The thing I guess I should say first is that while this is definitely a very funny movie, I think that it is somewhat overhyped.  I don't want people to think that it doesn't deserve most of the praise it receives, for it is very enjoyable and very accurate.  However, it isn't as groundbreaking/defining as many people make it out to be.  Still, it's a fun movie that everyone should see at least once.Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is a mid-level corporate drone working for a generic software company, and it doesn't look like he's going anywhere in life.  His best friends Michael Bolton (David Herman), who has no relation to the singer, and Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu), who is tired of Americans being unable to pronounce his name, are also employed at Initech, and have similar outlooks for the future.  The three spend their days hitting the printer that always jams and going to Chotchkie's, a TGIFridays-type restaurant that employs the beautiful Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), who Peter constantly pines for.  The other people in Peter's life include Anne (Alexandra Wentworth), his girlfriend whom he believes is cheating on him, Lawrence (the underused Diedrich Bader), his construction worker neighbor, Milton (Stephen Root), a mumbling coworker whose only loves in life are his radio and his red Swingline stapler, and Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), his evil, soulless boss who makes him work on the weekends and always starts sentences with ""Uh, yeah, what's happening?"".When Peter is brought to see an occupational hypnotherapist, the doc does wonders for him.  He is able to get Peter completely relaxed, but before he can wake Peter up, he keels over from a heart attack.  Now, Peter hasn't a care in the world.  He skips work, breaks up with Ann, and asks out Joanna.  And amazingly, just when Lumbergh is going to fire him, two ""efficiency consultants"" (played by John C. McGinley and Paul Willson) observe Peter's behavior and believe that he just isn't being challenged enough at work, and they reccomend him for a promotion!Eventually, using his newfound apathy, Peter decides that they should make good on Michael's constant quips about how he could write a virus that could scam Initech for millions.  Of course, things don't go as planned, and the results are of coures hilarious.This movie has often been lauded as being one of the greatest corporate satires ever made.  While I believe that it does get many things right, I don't think that this is anything new.  That doesn't prevent the movie from being funny, though.  Lumbergh's whole schtick about his personality and mannerisms is one of the greatest characterizations I've seen in years.  Furthermore, the whole Milton subplot where he is constantly being relocated by Lumbergh is fun just to see what Milton will mumble next.  I also now understand a lot of the things that I've heard people say in regards to this film (the case of the Mondays things is the most prominent).Overall, this is a film that most people, especially those who work for corporations like Initech, should see at least once.  My biggest gripe was the use of a lot of rap music, which I don't particularly care for, so if that's the biggest problem, that's not bad at all.  While it may not deserve all the hype it receives, there is still a lot of good to be said for Office Space.",4,"Very Funny, But Possibly Overrated",1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,3442,"['being', 'pestered', 'many', 'people', 'years', 'see', 'movie', 'have', 'finally', 'gotten', 'thing', 'guess', 'should', 'say', 'first', 'definitely', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'think', 'somewhat', 'overhyped', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'people', 'think', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'most', 'praise', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'accurate', 'However', ""n't"", 'as', 'groundbreaking/defining', 'many', 'people', 'make', 'be', 'Still', 'fun', 'movie', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once.Peter', 'Gibbons', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'mid-level', 'corporate', 'drone', 'working', 'generic', 'software', 'company', ""n't"", 'look', 'going', 'anywhere', 'life', 'best', 'friends', 'Michael', 'Bolton', 'David', 'Herman', 'who', 'relation', 'singer', 'Samir', 'Nagheenanajar', 'Ajay', 'Naidu', 'who', 'tired', 'Americans', 'being', 'unable', 'pronounce', 'name', 'are', 'also', 'employed', 'Initech', 'have', 'similar', 'outlooks', 'future', 'three', 'spend', 'days', 'hitting', 'printer', 'always', 'jams', 'going', 'Chotchkie', 'TGIFridays-type', 'restaurant', 'beautiful', 'Joanna', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'who', 'Peter', 'constantly', 'other', 'people', 'Peter', 'life', 'include', 'Anne', 'Alexandra', 'Wentworth', 'girlfriend', 'whom', 'cheating', 'Lawrence', 'underused', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'construction', 'worker', 'neighbor', 'Milton', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'mumbling', 'coworker', 'only', 'life', 'are', 'radio', 'red', 'Swingline', 'stapler', 'Bill', 'Lumbergh', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'evil', 'soulless', 'boss', 'who', 'work', 'weekends', 'always', 'starts', 'sentences', 'Uh', 'yeah', 'what', 'happening', '.When', 'Peter', 'brought', 'see', 'occupational', 'hypnotherapist', 'doc', 'wonders', 'able', 'get', 'Peter', 'completely', 'relaxed', 'can', 'wake', 'Peter', 'up', 'heart', 'attack', 'Now', 'Peter', ""n't"", 'care', 'world', 'work', 'up', 'Ann', 'out', 'Joanna', 'amazingly', 'just', 'when', 'Lumbergh', 'going', 'fire', 'two', 'efficiency', 'consultants', 'played', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'Paul', 'Willson', 'observe', 'Peter', 'behavior', 'believe', 'just', ""n't"", 'being', 'challenged', 'enough', 'work', 'reccomend', 'promotion', 'Eventually', 'using', 'newfound', 'apathy', 'Peter', 'should', 'make', 'good', 'Michael', 'constant', 'quips', 'how', 'could', 'write', 'virus', 'could', 'scam', 'Initech', 'millions', 'course', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'results', 'are', 'coures', 'hilarious.This', 'movie', 'often', 'been', 'lauded', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', 'corporate', 'satires', 'ever', 'made', 'believe', 'get', 'many', 'things', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'new', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'movie', 'being', 'funny', 'though', 'Lumbergh', 'whole', 'schtick', 'personality', 'mannerisms', 'one', 'greatest', 'characterizations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'Furthermore', 'whole', 'Milton', 'subplot', 'where', 'constantly', 'being', 'relocated', 'Lumbergh', 'fun', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'Milton', 'will', 'mumble', 'next', 'also', 'now', 'understand', 'lot', 'things', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'regards', 'film', 'case', 'Mondays', 'things', 'most', 'prominent', '.Overall', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'especially', 'who', 'work', 'corporations', 'Initech', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'was', 'use', 'lot', 'rap', 'music', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'so', 'biggest', 'problem', 'not', 'bad', 'may', 'not', 'deserve', 'hype', 'still', 'lot', 'good', 'be', 'said', 'Office', 'Space']",N/A

There are probably better examples of the , ""I hate my job"", movie out there to be enjoyed. Take some time out of your boring day at work and find `em.My wife got this for me because my job currently sucks BIG TIME so I got a vicarious thrill out of the conclusion. Even with that haze of sarcasm blurring my vision I must admit that the characters left me not really caring for ANY of them. They are rather cartoonish. Sorry Mike Judge, stick with the animation. It suits you better. The perplexing part of the plot is the main character's dream is to not have work, yet he keeps showing up there!!! It kind of makes you think this guy REALLY doesn't have a life beyond his dreary job. In other words, why would we care for a ""hero"" who is this much of a loser?!?!? This is where, for even the vicarious viewer, it gets stupid. If you hate your job, and don't want to go- (and the plot line says our man is hypnotized to be free of any employment worries)- why the heck do you keep coming back to this mundane garbage hole of place?!?!? I just want to smack this shmoe and tell him to actually start looking for a life.If you really want the deeper meaning to this movie it's that in so many businesses it tanks. America won't be beaten from other countries' ingenuity but rather its own internal stupidity. If you give people their freedom and independence they cling to the safe, secure and complacent places they feel comfortable existing. Outwardly they revel in their fantasy of being cowboys roaming the range; tough-minded mavericks who can take on any challenge. But really, where is the true independent, self-reliant, rebel in this movie, (or today's world)? If this guy was from the America of old, he would have blazed new trails, explored new things or at least set an example of living his OWN life. Instead he haunts the boring existence he wishes to be free of!  Go figure?!?!?!? We are left with a movie that shows how many people are reflected: scared, child-like and needing a paternal figure to guide their lives. But, I diverse.

The film stars Ron Livinstone as Peter Gibbons, and Jenniffer Anniston as Joanna. Peter, who is getting so stressed out by his job consults a dr. who hypnotizes him. But before he can take Peter out of the trance, he passes away making Peter temporarilly carefree. The next day despite his boss Lumberghs wishes, Peter skips work, and comes in on monday and takes no crap from his boss by destroying his cubicle walls playing Tetris while he's supposed to be working and putting dead fgish on the TPS reports, and after having a meeting with two hired  consultants Peter gets a promotion, but finds out his two best friends are gettings fired. Peter and his friends hatch a plan to lose the company millions, but theyll soon regret it.

Johnson ""Doug Johnson""","[1, 3]","A delightfully funny and heart warming romantic comedy (with emphasis on comedy) which was the first time I saw Ron Livingston acting; he plays Peter Gibbons. He is extremely funny as a somewhat pathetic and alienated office worker (computer programmer) who is used and abused by the computer software company he works for as is his two friends.After a botches hypnosis session that is supposed to make Peter content with his life as a computer programmer but instead emboldens him to live his life completely disregarding any consequences regarding his work (like fishing instead of working, sleeping in until 11:00 am then showing up for work for a few hours and then leaving), ""consultants"" advise him that his two buddies, fellow programmers Michael Botton (David Herman) and Samir (Ajay Naidu), two of the best programmers and most senior employees will be fired to save money by outsourcing their programming to India. Peter convinces his two friends help him defraud the company they work for at the rate of few pennies a day using a computer virus designed by David so that after several years they will have a tidy nest egg in savings.Peter, thanks to the hypnosis session, finds the boldness he previously lacked and begins dating Joanna (Jennifer Aniston); quickly they fall in love. Unfortunately, his romance is interrupted when he checks how Michael's virus is working. In one day, the computer program that should have collected a couple pennies collects over a $100,000.Faced with certain discovery, Peter's friendship with Samir and Michael as well as his romance with Joanna are shattered, and Peter plans to turn himself in while taking all the blame for the crime so that his friends will remain free.While on the way to the police and jail, Peter notices a fire (set by a different disgruntled employee) that burns down the computer company he works for, thus destroying all the incriminating accounting documents that might trace him to the crime; BTW, the money is also destroyed by the fire.This intended act of self-sacrifice regains the friendship of Samir and Michael, as well as the respect of Joanna. Thus, Peter is saved from jail, is reunited with his love, and regains the friendship of his two closest friends.This rather low budget film I found tastefully funny, relevant to contemporary feelings of alienation and hostility to companies out to make money at the expense of exploiting employees, and full of well written script and interesting and original plot.I heartily recommend it to film fans of comedy and/or romantic comedy.",5,One of the funniest flix I have ever seen RE the alienated worker theme . . .,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",2009,2566,"['delightfully', 'funny', 'heart', 'warming', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'emphasis', 'comedy', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'acting', 'Peter', 'Gibbons', 'extremely', 'funny', 'somewhat', 'pathetic', 'alienated', 'office', 'worker', 'computer', 'programmer', 'who', 'used', 'abused', 'computer', 'software', 'company', 'as', 'two', 'friends.After', 'botches', 'hypnosis', 'session', 'supposed', 'make', 'Peter', 'content', 'life', 'computer', 'programmer', 'instead', 'live', 'life', 'completely', 'disregarding', 'consequences', 'regarding', 'work', 'fishing', 'instead', 'working', 'sleeping', '11:00', 'am', 'then', 'showing', 'up', 'work', 'few', 'hours', 'then', 'leaving', 'consultants', 'advise', 'two', 'buddies', 'fellow', 'programmers', 'Michael', 'Botton', 'David', 'Herman', 'Samir', 'Ajay', 'Naidu', 'two', 'best', 'programmers', 'most', 'senior', 'employees', 'will', 'be', 'fired', 'save', 'money', 'outsourcing', 'programming', 'India', 'Peter', 'two', 'friends', 'help', 'defraud', 'company', 'work', 'rate', 'few', 'pennies', 'day', 'using', 'computer', 'virus', 'designed', 'David', 'that', 'several', 'years', 'will', 'have', 'tidy', 'nest', 'egg', 'savings.Peter', 'thanks', 'hypnosis', 'session', 'boldness', 'previously', 'lacked', 'dating', 'Joanna', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'quickly', 'fall', 'love', 'Unfortunately', 'romance', 'interrupted', 'when', 'how', 'Michael', 'virus', 'working', 'one', 'day', 'computer', 'program', 'should', 'have', 'collected', 'couple', 'pennies', '100,000.Faced', 'certain', 'discovery', 'Peter', 'friendship', 'Samir', 'Michael', 'as', 'well', 'romance', 'Joanna', 'are', 'shattered', 'Peter', 'turn', 'taking', 'blame', 'crime', 'friends', 'will', 'remain', 'free.While', 'way', 'police', 'jail', 'Peter', 'fire', 'set', 'different', 'disgruntled', 'employee', 'down', 'computer', 'company', 'thus', 'destroying', 'incriminating', 'accounting', 'documents', 'might', 'trace', 'crime', 'BTW', 'money', 'also', 'destroyed', 'fire.This', 'intended', 'act', 'self-sacrifice', 'regains', 'friendship', 'Samir', 'Michael', 'as', 'well', 'respect', 'Joanna', 'Thus', 'Peter', 'saved', 'jail', 'reunited', 'love', 'friendship', 'two', 'closest', 'friends.This', 'rather', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'found', 'tastefully', 'funny', 'relevant', 'contemporary', 'feelings', 'alienation', 'hostility', 'companies', 'out', 'make', 'money', 'expense', 'exploiting', 'employees', 'full', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'interesting', 'original', 'plot.I', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'comedy', 'and/or', 'romantic', 'comedy']",N/A

Filled with quirky characters and a hilarious employee rebellion, this is a movie for anyone who ever felt trapped in a soul-destroying job.Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss. His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell the pretty waitress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her. In an effort to relax, he accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under.The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy. He conspires with Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with no one the wiser. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control.""Office Space"" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly deranged employee who complains that ""you took my stapler."" This time, Milton is a minor character, although a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech.Judge creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (""Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhhhhhh...""). This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field. And of course, the dialogue is quietly insane (""Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day..."") as the plot grows grows more and more tense... until you know someone has to snap.The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective is immensely entertaining.

467831,AY1HVIM2V067E,6305508550,"Edward G. Nilges ""Author, 'Build Your Own .Ne...","[4, 14]","From the standpoint of one who's worked in software for thirty years it is dismaying to see the effect on the younger generation of the real computerized office, for it is either dystopian or perceived as such.In Office Space, the worklives of TwentySomethings have been  structured by Baby Boomer technical obsessions and Romanticism.  The offices which the Baby Boomers manage are computerized by unrelievedly bad software: the restaurants in which they eat lunch demand of the invisible &quot;help&quot; that the &quot;help&quot; cater to a commodified freedom and &quot;flair.&quot;Of course, this dystopia is dystopia in part because of perceptions.  Certainly, Java or HTML experts fleeing Kosovo in 1999, the year of the film's release, would be delighted to work in air conditioned offices not subject to artillery barrages.However, Herman Melville's 1850s short story, Bartelby the Scrivener compels us to take seriously the complaint that work is boring and unfair.  In the short story, Bartelby, after years of clerical work (that was brutally boring, owing to the lack of office automation: Bartelby was a human Xerox machine, and even in the 1940s, Microsoft exec Charles Szymonyi was grateful to be hired as a human &quot;computer&quot;), &quot;prefers not to&quot;, like the hero of Office Space, do any more fair copies.Office Space notes the unnoted ability of computer technology to generate absurd work at its margins, for its hero is engaged in manually scanning code for Year 2000 problems.  Now, I'd ask why this fictional character did not write a Perl script (a computer program) to do his job for him, but only to be a smartass: for in the type of organization portrayed in Office Space, ideological control prohibits such vernacular creativity.Unfortunately, had this movie been resolved at all realistically, there'd be, as they say, no movie.  For in fact very few people seem to ideologically rebel as our hero, who gets a job in construction (as if modern construction itself has not been Taylorized so as to render the construction worker equally subordinate as the computer programmer.)Here in the Research Triangle Park, it still seems the case that when most people are laid-off or otherwise maltreated by companies like Nortel, they respond by stronger adhesion to individualist narratives and at best form their own firms, wherein they replicate, in the small, the failure to address needs and narratives higher than the individual.Note that the hero of Office Space does not transform into someone who becomes a team player because he is informed by a mystical vision of the necessity of absolute care-for-others, to name one possibility.  He is at first transformed into the type that our system says it desires: the whats-in-it-for-me individualist.  The consultants like him precisely because he so perfectly &quot;does&quot; the entrepreneural spirit: but note that in reality, employment specialists have found that in the actual job market, the person who has in the past formed his own company or in other ways foolishly tried to act out a capitalist scenario is less desired than the long-term corporate type.Mike Judge does not, in other words, question some core assumptions of the business movie narrative.  Our narcissistic question throughout Office Space is how the hero will fare.Like Herman Melville, Mike Judge sees no way out and has none of Hamlet's good sense: &quot;I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself king of infinite space.&quot;Perhaps this is an important limitation of the way the American Transcendentalists narrated the money-mad lives of their fellow man when in the 1820s it became clear that we were not about to become a country on their model, where instead of working in sordid offices, or on the farm driving the slaves, we'd sit about listening to blue-stockings recite poetry, and Think Uplifting Thoughts.The real story is not escape from the counting-house or the modern office it is the ability of most real people to be bounded in a nutshell and count themselves kings of infinite space.  Some Americans do this through religion, others through drugs, still others by posting reviews on Amazon.  Redemption consists in the final realization that hegemony for good or ill is here to stay and there really is no way outa this place.

It follows Peter, a bored software engineer, as he deals with corporate downsizing, self-important management and bonehead corporate consultants.  Although this movie is set at a software company in Texas, it could have easily been set in any state in most any office.I actually saw this movie in the theater when I was still in college.  I thought it was funny, but I couldn't fully appreciate the office humor.  That's what makes this movie so funny.  It's not the great American movie, it's not deep and it's not trying to be anything it's not.  It's just a very funny and smart look at common situations and charactatures of people we all seem to have in our workplaces.

You won't catch all of Milton's (played by the same guy who was the station owner on NBC's News Radio) mumblings about his Swingline stapler and about the squirrels he used to watch outside his window.  One of the corporate consultants is played by the same guy who plays Dr. Cox on NBC's Scrubs, and he has some of my favorite lines as he interviews Peter's friend, Michael Bolton (no need to say more!).

The characters are likable (well, some of them, the ones that aren't steal the show too :)), and funny, the one-liners are great, the situations hilarious. The adorable main lead and his two cohorts-in-crime are funny, witty, and, in some cases, sleepy!

I don't want to give too much away, but it's a whole lotta fun watching some Slackers take over a tightwad office, and.... gasp!, getting promoted!

And, unlike many SNL skits, it makes a GREAT feature film. This film is completely fun to watch in a group, preferably with co-workers.

Well, with all recognizable funny and sad details of the modern office environment that show Judge's observant eye and wicked sense of humor, the movie is not a great one and not always a good one. It is an average comedy that had interesting potentials but is too long for its length and loses its steam somewhere after first thirty minutes. It's got too many subplots and supporting characters that were neither interesting, nor necessary, for example, the romance between Peter and a local waitress (Jennifer Aniston). A moneymaking scheme that Peter and his friends devise belongs to the different movie and Peter's transformation in the end does not seem to be plausible.

It feels undernouirshed and way too episodic.  The director, Mike Judge, came from TV, and it has a TV feel to it, as opposed to a cinematic feel.  The film doesn't flow at all.  The scenes go awkardly from one to the next.  However, there are some priceless moments (the conversation about ""flair"", Ron Livingston's great line about work (ain't exactly missing it), the destruction of the copy machine), but all these moments are actually in the trailer.  A lot of times between gags the film seems to be killing time, and the film ends up being very boring.  Some might argue that office work is boring (it is), but still, a realistic portrayal doesn't always translate into great filmmaking.  The performances here are first rate, with the underrated Gary Cole giving a hilarious one as Ron Livingston's boss.  Livingston himself makes a great sad sack and Jennifer Aniston is nice as the waitress who is Ron's love interest.  It's not the deepest romance ever, but it passes the time.

And sure enough, the movie started off pretty well, highlighting the petty nonsense that makes office work wretched: daily traffic jams, cutesy co-workers, malfunctioning machines, smarmy bosses and pointless work. And many of the film's catch phrases have made it into office usage -- the infamous ""TPS"" report and ""'Sounds like someone has a case of the Mondays!""The film deals with Peter Gibbons, a young programmer who hates his big corporate job. At the instigation of his overbearing girlfriend, he attends a hypnosis session that ends prematurely, leaving him in a blissful state of nonchalance. At work the next day, Gibbons blithely ignores all rules of office and social etiquette. He arrives in casual clothing, plays Tetris all day, removes his cubical walls and asks a cute waitress out to lunch. His newfound lack of caring is perceived as freshness and candor by a couple of efficiency experts bent on reducing headcount.Yet at this point, halfway through the movie, ""Office Space"" lost its charm and gains lots of loosely-connected subplots. The hypnosis gimmick that drove the first half is suddenly and inexplicably dropped. The film morphs into comic romance between Gibbons and a waitress played by Jennifer Aniston. Gibbons and a couple of coworkers hatch a harebrained scam to revenge themselves on the company, and that threatens to land them all in the pokey. Aniston argues with her boss, a restaurant manager who expects his staff to be perpetually peppy, with lots of ""flair"" decorating their uniforms. All of this activity adds up to very little in the end.For its hits and magic moments, ""Office Space"" had plenty of misses. Richard Riehle's ""Tom Smykowski"" is a google-eyed, acne-scarred old timer whose panicked mumbling and emotional attachment to office supplies came across as kind of sad. I guess I've known too many real people like him who were marginalized and then forced out of corporations. The soundtrack consists (pointlessly) of quite foul rap music. A subplot about a malfunctioning office machine manages only to be confusing. The satire of peppy theme restaurants lacks punch. As an office worker myself, I was disappointed by the missed opportunities to lampoon office life. Only one character -- Gibbons' blue-collar neighbor Lawrence (Diedrich Bader) is memorable, consistent and likable.""Office Space"" has contributed more than its share of catch phrases and characters. But its inconsistent characterizations, sloppy plotting, unrelenting vulgarity, gratuitous female nudity and misfiring satire made it as annoying is it was funny.

467855,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6305508550,Jeffrey Leach,"[1, 2]","Anyone who has ever worked in a corporate environment, an environment necessitating the need for cubicles, needs to go out right away and pick up a copy of ""Office Space."" Created, written, and directed by Mike Judge-the same guy responsible for ""Beavis and Butthead""-this 1999 movie perfectly captures the innumerable torments of the modern white-collar worker. The film did poor box office during its theatrical run, but has since become a massive cult classic on video and DVD. It's no wonder. The movie is funny, cynical, and is the only film in my opinion to adequately use rap music to great effect. To give you an idea of how popular this movie has become-my own mother has heard about the movie and made me rent it so she could watch it. Yep, when your own aging mom knows about a movie, you just know it has jumped the boundaries of a narrow audience and become a pop culture phenomenon. For those poor souls who waste the days of their lives imprisoned in a small box in some generic looking office building out in the suburbs, ""Office Space"" is the best way to channel your rage. It sure beats going postal, at least.Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingstone) is the moral and physical center of ""Office Space."" This young guy works at Initech, one of those late '90's computer tech firms that sprang up across the country like weeds. Peter hates his job, hates his bosses, and hates sitting in his cubicle listening to annoying co-workers. He especially despises Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), a vice-president of the company who takes great pleasure in asking Gibbons to work on the weekends even as he hassles him endlessly about those ""TPS"" reports. The problems don't stop there, though. Peter's girlfriend is a controlling personality with a decidedly loose sexual reputation. Gibbons trudges through his days, finding solace only in two sympathetic co-workers named Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman). His neighbor in the apartment next to his, a construction worker named Lawrence (Diedrich Bader), provides an occasional breath of fresh air as well. Peter Gibbons's life is a complete disappointment, an endless march of days doing nothing more than updating computer programs for Y2K and sitting around in his generic apartment watching Kung Fu. Something has to change before Peter goes off his rocker, and after he visits an occupational hypnotist, it does.After Dr. Swanson (Mike McShane) dies suddenly in the midst of hypnotizing Peter, Gibbons is a changed man. He saunters into work whenever he feels like it, wearing casual clothes and ignoring his bosses. He finally asks out Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), a cute waitress working at a restaurant called Chotchkie's, after months of indecision. After a midday fishing trip, Peter guts his catch on a huge stack of TPS reports. Something is definitely wrong with this guy. His friends worry about his reckless behavior, especially with a couple of consultants-the two Bobs-hired by Lumbergh to pare down the company lurking in the background, and try to shake him out of his malaise. Peter is undeterred and, when he learns his antics have actually garnered him a promotion while the consultants consign his two pals to the unemployment line, hatches a plot to bilk Initech out of a boatload of money. Predictably, the plans go horribly long, leaving Peter, Samir, and Michael in a desperate situation. Will the three survive to work another day? Will Peter find the fulfillment he's been seeking for so long? Will Bill Lumbergh ever quit saying ""mmkay""? These questions, and many others, will find resolution at the conclusion of ""Office Space.""I'm not even going to waste time describing in detail the huge number of characters, all of them brilliant, who populate the universe of ""Office Space."" Obviously, Milton Waddams (Stephen Root) deserves special mention since he constitutes an entire subplot of the movie. Based on a series of short cartoons Judge made for ""Saturday Night Live"" in the early 1990s, Milton is quite a character. You'll either love him or hate him; I liked some of his shtick (the stapler, the cake), but thought he detracted somewhat from the main plot involving Peter Gibbons. What really stands out in the movie is the immensely quotable dialogue, some of it arguably the best lines in motion picture history (paraphrasing here):""Somebody has a case of the Mondays!""""He [Lumbergh] represents everything that is soulless and wrong.""""Ha Ha-he's not related to Bill, is he?""I could go on and on. For instance, the sound Peter makes when he learns from Joanna that she did indeed have a relationship with Lumbergh is priceless: it's the sound a person makes when the very essence of their being is wounded. The fantastic dialogue and horrifically true aphorisms virtually demand repeated viewings of this movie. Everyone who works should own a copy of ""Office Space.""I've never met anybody who doesn't like this movie. Even my mom got a chuckle out of it. I drop anything I'm doing to watch it whenever it shows up on cable television. It's quite sad the film did poorly at the box office since a sequel, while it probably wouldn't have been as good as the original, could still have been great fun. Unfortunately, the DVD version of the movie is poor, with almost no extras worth mentioning. I'm praying the studio will release a special edition DVD at some point in the future with commentary tracks by Judge, Livingstone, Cole, Herman, Root, and other critical cast members. No other film in recent history deserves such a release more than ""Office Space.""

467869,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6305508550,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[4, 23]","Mundane trivialities have a significant importance in many people's lives, as they have sunk into an existence where an income is more important than happiness.  The unhappiness often begins with everyday routines such as getting back and forth from work while spending the majority of their time at a job where they are miserable.  This suburban look on existentialism might be something that many can connect with, as everyday begins with the apprehension of the annoying alarm clock's sound and the irritating traffic congestions.  Meanwhile, the people tend to complain about the mind-numbing dreadfulness of their existence, as they do nothing to create a change for themselves.  A resulting factor is that they have entrapped themselves in the corporate establishment where their desire of objects is larger than the yearning for happiness. Mike Judge's film Office Space takes on the corporate induced melancholy through the eyes of a worn-out office worker Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) who takes matters in his own hands.The comical humor in the initial scene presents the notion of the large number of people who commute back and forth to work.  Coming from Chicago, I can relate to the long and difficult ventures through the crammed highways, which also gets to Peter and his coworkers.  This sequence also suggests how many people actually undergo the everyday torment of making a living, maybe with a job that they hate.  Whether people hate their job, or not, the film encapsulates the essence of the frustration that comes with the occupational travel.  In addition, Judge shows that he understands the accumulation of frustration, as the journey to work spills over into the working day when the workers vent their anger on uncooperative fax machines and annoyance of repetitive sound.  If the problems were not enough with frustration and boredom, the bosses, here Bill Lundberg (Gary Cole), breathes down necks with overtime and better quality production.  One of the frequent behaviors that helps Peter and his friends manage their frustration is to wish their lives away by desiring for time to move faster, which could hasten time to the returning commute home.The negative professional life that Peter possesses influences his personal and social life, as he returns home depleted after the emotional and psychological stress of his job.  It even affects his sleeping pattern, as nightmares about work haunt him.  The stress continues to increase as Initech, the company that he works for, has decided to downsize and his girlfriend has arranged for them to see a hypnotherapist to help deal with their relationship.  However, amidst the hypnosis of Peter, that is supposed to help him feel more blissful, the therapist suffers from a heart attack.  Peter remains within the peaceful ignorance of what is happening in his life, as he decides to sleep through the weekend and not go to work without feeling guilt, anguish, or any other kind of negative emotional response that would cause stress.The aftermath of not showing up at work for the weekend overtime begins to mount, and with the notion of the downsizing in the back of the mind, his future might seem dark in regards to employment and economy.  However, in his mental state of happiness he finds strength to take control of his own life, which takes his life on a number of unexpected turns.  If the corporate America experienced an overwhelming number of people undergoing hypnosis similar to Peter's, it would drastically affect the national economy.  With this in mind, the film provides an interesting thought in regards to personal happiness and the commercial industry's desire to control people's pleasure with what people need for financial profits.Office Space presents a truly remarkable societal comedy that reflects on the average person's place in society in the shadow of socioeconomic status.  It does so with a heavy dose of comic relief, as it portrays a wide range of interesting characters such as the flair wearing waitress Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), the closet tough guy Michael Bolton (David Herman), and the enterprising Samir (Ajay Naidu).  Then there is the muttering Milton (Stephen Root) who the company has laid off, but never informed.

Ron Livingston stars as Peter; a man so stuck in his cubicle at his dead end job that he undergoes hypnosis and decides not to do anything at all.  As he puts it best later on in the film: ""It's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care.""  When company downsizing starts, he surprisingly ends up getting promoted, but when his two friends are in line to be laid off, they hatch a scheme to skim funds from the company's accounts.  The film itself is laugh out loud hilarious from beginning to end, thanks to the great screen play and Judge's excellent direction.  The rest of the cast is perfect as well; including Jennifer Aniston as Peter's new girlfriend, Gary Cole as Peter's smarmy jerk boss, Diedrich Bader as Peter's hilarious mullett headed neighbor, and a scene stealing Stephen Root as Milton; the company's constantly pushed around and neglected mumbling employee whose trials and tribulations you'll bust a gut laughing at.

Ron Livingston is Peter, one such cube dweller at Initech, a corporation we never learn much about (I think they develop banking software).  It's not important, of course, because Initech looks and feels like so many offices in so many industries all across America.  Bored to tears at his job Peter undergoes hypnosis at a therapist and suddenly snapping out of his routine, breaking up with his corporate girlfriend.  He goes into a peaceful, carefree sort of trance where he coasts through work until two ""consultants"" (who signal the coming of layoffs) determine he's just not being challenged enough at work.  Meanwhile, Peter's more productive friends are cut away on recommendation of their slimy manager, Bill Lumbergh, played by Gary Cole with such nauseating, weasle-like smarminess that you've seen less talented people get Oscars for smaller roles.  The trio of friends, tired of being the little guys, hatch a scheme to funnell money slowly and secretly from Initech.  Meanwhile, a neurotic coworker slowly cracks as his desk is moved farther and farther away from everyone else...Office Space is a must for anyone who has ever worked in an office.  Sat at a cubicle.  Wanted to take a fax machine into an open field and beat it with a bat while blasting Ice Cube.  It captures American corporate microculture perfectly, laughing in the face of being micromanaged to death.  But it touches on unversal elements and the laughs are steady, captured in the details like the boss everyone hates, or rap music in suburbia.  A shame this got such a small theatrical release; it found a nice following on tape and DVD.Here's a small, low budget film delivering laughs and some wicked humor.

Nothing here disturbs the serienity of our hero, and his quest to do absolutely nothing, in the hopes that it wiil be everything he thought it would be.....Watching this movie, about engineers in their mid-20's, brings back so many memories  of how it was for me being an engineer in my mid-20's, trying my best to adapt myself to corporate lifestyle, clumsily chasing women, and trying desperatly to enjoy the last shreds of my fast-fading youth.There are so many priceless scenes in this movie--Ron Livingston is on a date with Jenifer Anniston, when she askes him the dreaded question ""what do you do for a living?""  What software engineer can't help but cringe along with our hero?  Just exactly how are software engineers supposed to answer that question?  Heck, our bosses can't even comprehend what we're doing.  Any attempt to explain will inevitably make us appear geeky and then boring, but we can't just lie,  can we?On the topic of lying--my wife (who works in P.R.) claims that engineers are incapable of lying--and  that is what is holding them back :-)  This movie of course has to document the inevitable doom which falls upon our hero when he boldly tries to lie like no engineer has lied before...But the best metaphor of the movie, IMHO, is poor Milton, who, at a corporate birthday party for the boss,  has to keep passing along slices of birthday cake to everybody else--the cake, symbolising the rewards gotten from submitting yourself to corporate life--the cake passing right under his nose.

467917,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305508550,Reviewer,"[1, 2]","There's something about a study of life in a ""cubicle"" to which just about everyone can relate; at least everyone who has ever had to get up every day, go to work and punch a time clock, then go home and wait to do it all over again the next day.  In ""Office Space,"" writer/director Mike Judge (the guy who gave us ""Beavis and Butthead"") captures the essence of the work-a-day world, in this case in an office setting, though it could be on any job anywhere, from the largest conglomerate to the smallest business concern; anywhere a ""corporate structure"" is in place and employed.  The subtle humor of Judge's vision is funny, and often downright hilarious, and all with very little exaggeration of the way things really are, from the weekly ""motivational"" talks from the boss, to staff meetings, corporate ""mission statements"" and the protocol of cover sheets and memos, all of which-- as portrayed here-- have a sterling ring of truth to them.  The central character of Judge's story is a guy named Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), a software analyst for ""Initech,"" who after working with a therapist finds himself in something of a transcendental state of mind, whereupon he divulges to a pair of consultants-- ""efficiency experts"" sent in to streamline the company's operation-- that he does only about ""fifteen minutes of real work"" a week, due to the very structure (or lack thereof) of the company itself.  And his refreshingly honest candor in outlining his job description soon has quite an unexpected effect on his life, as well as that of a couple of co-workers.  Judge perceptively expands the satire to encompass facets of Peter's life outside the office, as well, which gives the audience even more with which to identify, like driving to work in bumper to bumper freeway traffic that has slowed to a stop-- in Peter's lane-- while the cars in the next lane going flying by; and when he changes into THAT lane, IT comes to a standstill while the cars in the lane he just left start to whiz on by.  It's an application of Murphy's Law that -- while certainly nothing new-- works well within the context of this particular story, in which the humor is derived from emphasizing the annoying, mundane things that happen to us all on a daily basis.  Like getting in the shortest line at the supermarket and taking longer than anyone else to get checked out.  Livingston gives a notable performance, giving Peter that sense of the ""everyman"" who'd like nothing better than to break free of the rigors of the 8 to 5 existence.  He brings an affable presence to the screen that perfectly communicates what Judge is attempting to say, and does it in such a way that it validates Peter's being selected as ""Champion of the Cause"" as it were.  Also turning in memorable performances are Stephen Root (a terrific character actor), as Milton, a guy whose very existence seems to be a study in suffering abuse and degradation; and Gary Cole, as Peter's boss, Bill Lumbergh, whose impudent, laconic methods of intimidation, delivered in such a droll manner, make him the boss everybody loves to hate.  The supporting cast includes Jennifer Aniston as Joanna, the waitress with a minimum of ""flare"" who has trouble ""expressing"" herself, according to her boss; Ajay Naidu (Samir); David Herman (Michael Bolton); Richard Riehle (Tom); Joe Bays (Dom); John C. McGinley (Bob Slydell); Paul Wilson (Bob Porter) and Diedrich Bader (Lawrence).  Reminiscent of the world portrayed in the ""Dilbert"" comic strip, ""Office Space"" works because it effectively puts real people in real situations, and brings you into contact with some characters you're going to recognize; I guarantee that no matter what you do to live, thrive and survive, you've run into these people, worked for them, and alongside them.  It's a case of art reflecting reality, and to Judge's credit he's succeeded in making a funny movie that really hits close to home, without resorting to any gross or infantile humor to do it.  It's a film that simply puts the ""corporate experience"" in the spotlight and gives you a chance to laugh at ""the boss,"" and maybe even a little bit at yourself along the way.",4,Somebody's Got A Case Of &quot;The Mondays!&quot;,983750400,"03 5, 2001",2001,4161,"['something', 'study', 'life', 'cubicle', 'just', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'least', 'everyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'get', 'up', 'day', 'go', 'work', 'punch', 'time', 'clock', 'then', 'go', 'home', 'wait', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'next', 'day', 'Office', 'Space', 'writer/director', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'guy', 'who', 'gave', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'essence', 'work-a-day', 'world', 'case', 'office', 'setting', 'could', 'be', 'job', 'anywhere', 'largest', 'conglomerate', 'smallest', 'business', 'concern', 'anywhere', 'corporate', 'structure', 'place', 'employed', 'subtle', 'humor', 'Judge', 'vision', 'funny', 'often', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'very', 'little', 'exaggeration', 'way', 'things', 'really', 'are', 'weekly', 'motivational', 'talks', 'boss', 'staff', 'meetings', 'corporate', 'mission', 'statements', 'protocol', 'cover', 'sheets', 'memos', 'portrayed', 'here', 'have', 'sterling', 'ring', 'truth', 'central', 'character', 'Judge', 'story', 'guy', 'named', 'Peter', 'Gibbons', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'software', 'analyst', 'Initech', 'who', 'working', 'therapist', 'something', 'transcendental', 'state', 'mind', 'pair', 'consultants', 'efficiency', 'experts', 'sent', 'streamline', 'company', 'operation', 'only', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'real', 'work', 'week', 'due', 'very', 'structure', 'lack', 'thereof', 'company', 'refreshingly', 'honest', 'candor', 'outlining', 'job', 'description', 'soon', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'effect', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'co-workers', 'Judge', 'perceptively', 'satire', 'encompass', 'facets', 'Peter', 'life', 'office', 'well', 'audience', 'even', 'more', 'identify', 'driving', 'work', 'bumper', 'bumper', 'freeway', 'traffic', 'slowed', 'stop', 'Peter', 'lane', 'cars', 'next', 'lane', 'going', 'flying', 'when', 'lane', 'IT', 'standstill', 'cars', 'lane', 'just', 'left', 'start', 'whiz', 'application', 'Murphy', 'Law', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'new', 'well', 'context', 'particular', 'story', 'humor', 'derived', 'emphasizing', 'annoying', 'mundane', 'things', 'happen', 'daily', 'basis', 'getting', 'shortest', 'line', 'supermarket', 'taking', 'longer', 'anyone', 'else', 'get', 'checked', 'out', 'Livingston', 'notable', 'performance', 'giving', 'Peter', 'sense', 'everyman', 'who', ""'d"", 'like', 'nothing', 'better', 'break', 'free', 'rigors', '8', '5', 'existence', 'affable', 'presence', 'screen', 'perfectly', 'what', 'Judge', 'attempting', 'say', 'way', 'Peter', 'being', 'selected', 'Champion', 'Cause', 'were', 'Also', 'turning', 'memorable', 'performances', 'are', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'terrific', 'character', 'actor', 'Milton', 'guy', 'very', 'existence', 'be', 'study', 'suffering', 'abuse', 'degradation', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Peter', 'boss', 'Bill', 'Lumbergh', 'impudent', 'laconic', 'methods', 'intimidation', 'delivered', 'such', 'droll', 'manner', 'make', 'boss', 'everybody', 'hate', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Joanna', 'waitress', 'minimum', 'flare', 'who', 'trouble', 'expressing', 'herself', 'according', 'boss', 'Ajay', 'Naidu', 'Samir', 'David', 'Herman', 'Michael', 'Bolton', 'Richard', 'Riehle', 'Tom', 'Joe', 'Bays', 'Dom', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'Bob', 'Slydell', 'Paul', 'Wilson', 'Bob', 'Porter', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'Lawrence', 'Reminiscent', 'world', 'portrayed', 'Dilbert', 'comic', 'strip', 'Office', 'Space', 'works', 'effectively', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'situations', 'contact', 'characters', ""'re"", 'going', 'recognize', 'guarantee', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'live', 'thrive', 'survive', ""'ve"", 'run', 'people', 'worked', 'alongside', 'case', 'art', 'reflecting', 'reality', 'Judge', 'credit', 'succeeded', 'making', 'funny', 'movie', 'really', 'close', 'home', 'resorting', 'gross', 'infantile', 'humor', 'do', 'film', 'simply', 'corporate', 'experience', 'spotlight', 'chance', 'laugh', 'boss', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'way']",N/A

Unfortunately, anyone offering this argument in conversation could be well trumped by their opponent whipping out a copy of OFFICE SPACE and dropping it into the DVD player.You see, this is a comedy for a moment, for a very short time in our history when lots of young educated folk where making some really good money doing ridiculously boring work and reporting to morons.  This movie captures that moment in all it's glorious dullness and then pulls it apart one side-splitting joke at a time.The lens of the camera is wider than corporate computer jobs though.  Mr. Judge has captured the lifestyle of that time extremely well.  From the ever increasing abundance of TGI Fridays type restaurants, to the painstaking 45 minute, 3 mile commute.  This is a comedy that reeks of 1990's mainstream life.In terms of quality; acting, direction, and photography are all average but are helped immensely by a sound-track that also captures the musical tastes of the late 90's.  Jennifer Aniston's role as a go-nowhere waitress is passable.  It is the  comedy that makes OFFICE SPACE a great pick.

467920,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6305508550,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 12]","Office Space (Mike Judge, 1999)It has seemed that over the years since this relatively obscure little movie came out, it's enjoyed a growing popularity simply on word of mouth. Pretty much everyone I know makes multiple references to it in just about every work-related conversation I've had. One it started showing up in commercials, I figured it was time to get around to seeing it. And while I didn't think it was awful, I have to wonder what those who say ""if you've worked in this environment, you'll think this is the funniest movie ever"" were smoking when they saw it. It's mildly amusing, but nothing special.In case you've been living under a rock for seven years, the plot: Peter Gibbons (Standoff's Ron Livingston), a drone at a large corporation, is just living day to day, doing nothing but working, obsessed with Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), a waitress at the local sports bar, with his only social interaction outside the workplace being with his somewhat psychotic neighbor Lawrence (well-known voice actor Diedrich Bader) when they talk through the thin walls of their condos. The company brings in a pair of efficiency experts, Bob (John C. McGinley) and Bob (Paul Wilson), and something snaps; Gibbons decides to simply neglect his job. Needless to say, the second he does this, his supervisor, Bill (Gary Cole) calls for his head, and the efficiency experts decide he needs to be promoted to upper management. And things just get weirder from there.It's not a bad film, really-- I just don't think it lives up to the incredible hype that it's now almost impossible to see this movie without experiencing. You will likely be told that it's the best thing since sliced bread, and that if you don't find it the funniest movie you've ever seen, you just don't get it. Not true. Remember, Mike Judge is the guy behind Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill; if you were never a fan, this probably isn't going to change your mind. Still, it is true that if you work in an office environment, you'll either identify with or recognize a lot of these people, and that goes a long way towards redeeming some of the jokes that don't quite cut it. ** ",3,Meh.,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,2160,"['Office', 'Space', 'Mike', 'Judge', '1999', 'seemed', 'years', 'relatively', 'obscure', 'little', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'enjoyed', 'growing', 'popularity', 'simply', 'word', 'mouth', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'know', 'multiple', 'references', 'just', 'work-related', 'conversation', ""'ve"", 'had', 'One', 'started', 'showing', 'up', 'commercials', 'figured', 'was', 'time', 'get', 'seeing', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'awful', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'who', 'say', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'environment', ""'ll"", 'think', 'funniest', 'movie', 'ever', 'were', 'smoking', 'when', 'saw', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'nothing', 'special.In', 'case', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'rock', 'seven', 'years', 'plot', 'Peter', 'Gibbons', 'Standoff', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'drone', 'large', 'corporation', 'just', 'living', 'day', 'day', 'doing', 'nothing', 'working', 'obsessed', 'Joanna', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'waitress', 'local', 'sports', 'bar', 'only', 'social', 'interaction', 'workplace', 'being', 'somewhat', 'psychotic', 'neighbor', 'Lawrence', 'well-known', 'voice', 'actor', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'when', 'talk', 'thin', 'walls', 'condos', 'company', 'pair', 'efficiency', 'experts', 'Bob', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'Bob', 'Paul', 'Wilson', 'something', 'snaps', 'Gibbons', 'simply', 'neglect', 'job', 'Needless', 'say', 'second', 'supervisor', 'Bill', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'head', 'efficiency', 'experts', 'be', 'promoted', 'upper', 'management', 'things', 'just', 'get', 'weirder', 'there.It', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'up', 'incredible', 'hype', 'now', 'almost', 'impossible', 'see', 'movie', 'experiencing', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'told', 'best', 'thing', 'sliced', 'bread', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'funniest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Not', 'true', 'Remember', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'guy', 'Beavis', 'Butt-Head', 'King', 'Hill', 'were', 'never', 'fan', 'probably', ""n't"", 'going', 'change', 'mind', 'Still', 'true', 'work', 'office', 'environment', ""'ll"", 'either', 'identify', 'recognize', 'lot', 'people', 'long', 'way', 'redeeming', 'jokes', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'cut', '**']",N/A

Office Space has become a cult classic of sorts.  I've worked in a corporate environment for seven years now and this movie is just as funny now as it was when I first saw it back in the day.  Its scary how little the work place has changed.Mike Judge assembled a great crew to pull this movie off.  The sets are great, from Initech's cubicle mazes, to Chotchkie's all to familiar decor, to Peter's apartment.  He's got a great cast with Ron Livingston playing our everyman main character.  Perhaps it is Gary Cole as Bill Lumbergh that makes the best impression as the oh-so-subtle manager without a clue.  Or maybe its John C. McGinley as Bob the efficiency expert that steals the vote for best supporting actor in this comedy.  But how can you forget Stephen Root as Milton, the inspiration for this comedic adventure.  And I can't leave out David Herman or Ajay Naidu as the poor dopes that get roped into Peter's clever scheme.  Oh yeah and Jennifer Aniston is in it too.The script is great, especially when it flings its barbed humor at the corporate world.  Things falter a bit when Peter scheme kicks into action, but there are plenty of good bits after as well (my favorite being the fate of the office printer).  The use of gangster rap music is appropriate, but I know some viewers won't appreciate it or the use of colorful language throughout the movie.This is a great piece of entertainment, and proves that Mike Judge is as good with live action films as he is with animation.

But in my Communications graduate course, the teacher showed the first five minutes of it and I thought it was hilarious.  Then one of my co-workers recommended it and I tried to watch his copy, but it was bootleg and after 28 minutes, it flipped out on me. So I was determined to see this movie.  How unfortunate.  The movie is about a frustrated office worker who moves up in the company after going under hypnosis and after still being unsatisfied, he decides to steal from the company when his friends are fired.  There are so many problems with this movie I don't know where to begin. For the first 40 minutes of the movie, I cried laughing. Everything was totally true and I loved it. But then when he moved up in the company, the movie became very stupid.  #1  If the hypnosis really worked, he wouldn't be able to snap out of it until going to another psychologist.  #2  The only black people portrayed in this WHOLE movie were some guy selling stuff on the side of the road, a lawyer who knew all about jail (hmm...wonder where that idea came from?), and a magazine salesman who portrayed himself as a crackhead, a hustler, and later a software promoter.  He blackmailed the main character into buying forty subscriptions of Vibe (how ironic) and was never seen again.  I find it hard to believe that in an office that big, they felt that no blacks needed to be cast.  But the production cast felt it absolutely necessary to throw in rap music with the n-word and ""Monkey ass"" in it whenever possible--during the beating of a copy machine, at the beginning with the ""down"" co-worker, any bad scene, rap music was played.  That annoyed me on so many different levels--that and whomever the rapper was!  #3  The system they used to steal money would definitely be blocked in a real workplace environment. There's no way that three people could use that system and get away with it.  #4  Maybe I fell asleep, but how did the accident with the building happen? I still didn't catch that.  #5 The love interest in the restaurant was right on point though!  And like I said...the first 40 minutes were great.  The rest of the movie should've been thrown in the garbage and I wish I would've stuck to the 30 minutes I saw on bootleg.",2,Beneath the Surface,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,2268,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'Communications', 'graduate', 'course', 'teacher', 'showed', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Then', 'one', 'co-workers', 'recommended', 'tried', 'watch', 'copy', 'was', 'bootleg', '28', 'minutes', 'flipped', 'out', 'was', 'determined', 'see', 'movie', 'How', 'unfortunate', 'movie', 'frustrated', 'office', 'worker', 'who', 'up', 'company', 'going', 'hypnosis', 'still', 'being', 'unsatisfied', 'steal', 'company', 'when', 'friends', 'are', 'fired', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'movie', 'cried', 'laughing', 'Everything', 'was', 'totally', 'true', 'loved', 'then', 'when', 'moved', 'up', 'company', 'movie', 'became', 'very', 'stupid', '1', 'hypnosis', 'really', 'worked', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'snap', 'going', 'psychologist', '2', 'only', 'black', 'people', 'portrayed', 'WHOLE', 'movie', 'were', 'guy', 'selling', 'stuff', 'side', 'road', 'lawyer', 'who', 'knew', 'jail', 'hmm', 'wonder', 'where', 'idea', 'came', 'magazine', 'salesman', 'who', 'portrayed', 'crackhead', 'hustler', 'later', 'software', 'promoter', 'blackmailed', 'main', 'character', 'buying', 'forty', 'subscriptions', 'Vibe', 'how', 'ironic', 'was', 'never', 'seen', 'again', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'office', 'big', 'felt', 'blacks', 'needed', 'be', 'cast', 'production', 'cast', 'felt', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'throw', 'rap', 'music', 'n-word', 'Monkey', 'ass', 'whenever', 'possible', 'beating', 'copy', 'machine', 'beginning', 'down', 'co-worker', 'bad', 'scene', 'rap', 'music', 'was', 'played', 'annoyed', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'whomever', 'rapper', 'was', '3', 'system', 'used', 'steal', 'money', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'blocked', 'real', 'workplace', 'environment', 'way', 'three', 'people', 'could', 'use', 'system', 'get', 'away', '4', 'Maybe', 'fell', 'asleep', 'how', 'did', 'accident', 'building', 'happen', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', '5', 'love', 'interest', 'restaurant', 'was', 'right', 'point', 'said', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'were', 'great', 'rest', 'movie', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'thrown', 'garbage', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'stuck', '30', 'minutes', 'saw', 'bootleg']",N/A

Nothing against Beavis and Butthead, but it just didn't seem like someone responsible for that could come up with a live-action movie that would really stand out to me, and the fact that it started from a tiny cartoon that was so exceedingly simple that it probably could have only been funny for the minute in which it took place.  By the time it was out on video, something convinced me to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did.  This movie is a joy to watch, and it never ceases to keep me laughing even after seeing it multiple times.
