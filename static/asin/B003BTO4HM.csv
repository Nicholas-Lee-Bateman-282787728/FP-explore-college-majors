As far as the mayhem quotient, it's normal for a late '50s/early '60s TV western.  Some good, nicely staged gunplay and stunts are scattered throughout.  So kudos to Timeless Media Group for releasing ""Whispering Smith"" a half century later.  The print and audio quality are excellent.  The running time appears to be full length, not annoyingly abbreviated like TMG's other western titles from Revue/Universal, ""Laredo"" and ""Wagon Train."" (Why, oh why, doesn't TMG go the extra mile and provide consumers the full-length prints on ""Laredo"" and ""Wagon Train?!"")  How nice it is to see Universal Studios' Denver Street in all its glory.  (A couple years later it became Medicine Bow for ""The Virginian."")  Also nice that the brief title card and music fanfare at the midshow commercial break position is maintained.  Two gripes on ""Whispering Smith"" from TMG: 1) It's not necessary to edit the Revue Productions title card and fanfare at the tail of the end titles, so why does TMG do this?!  To this user it's maddening.  2) No bonus tracks.  We all know star Audie Murphy's dead, but surely TMG could have rounded up a few guest stars, an assistant director, publicist or someone similar with first hand knowledge of the show's production to enlighten viewers and make this a really special DVD.

I have read that Murphy didn't like doing this show but I didn't see any hint of that.  This series was filmed in around 1959 and unknown to Murphy his career was about to hit a down turn.  after this he appeared in just one more major motion piture- ""The Unforgivin"" with Burt Landcaster.  After that, dispite a fine porformace, he went on to only make B-movies of very low quality.Murphy is in fine form in this show, he had matured out of his ""kid"" look.  This is basicly a detective show in an old west town.  I think that it was a lost opportunty that Jack Webb or someone never developed a modern detective show for Audie Murphy in the 60's.  As a part-time lawman and a conservative icon he would have been perfect.One thing that I enjoy about this show is that it was a half hour series and makes for good repeated viewing, more so than hour long dvd collections, IMO.This set is essential to any Audie Murphy collection.

Whispering Smith tries never to shoot to kill and usually brings in the culprit.  Audie Murphy is competent in the role and obviously knows how to handle a gun.  The supporting actors are equally competent.  The picture quality is excellent and the sound is good.Black and white was the TV of the 50's, so this is a good way to show your grandchildren what you watched when you were their age. I vaguely remember this particular series, but it is representative of the western series of the time - Hop-along Cassidy, Annie Oakley, The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, etc.  It's clean family fun.  The bad guys get their comeuppances, no blood spurting, not even a bullet hole.  It was a simpler time in America, when even the cities were safer and the people were nicer.So, do what we do.  Each week for 25 weeks on Tuesday night (pick whatever night works for you) after dinner, pop up some corn. Sit down with the family, or some friends and watch a half hour of Whispering Smith.

Beer ""classic tv fan""","[75, 78]","Yep, this was an obscure western series from 1959-60, but it waited until late in the 1960-61 season when it finally made its debut, because of one problem after another. First, Guy Mitchell, the singer-actor who played George Romack, broke his shoulder falling from a horse, therby halting production for several weeks, enabling Audie Murphy to do a movie. Sam Buffington, who played Smith and Romack's boss Capt. John Richards comitted suicide in May 1960, guess he wasn't happy doing the series. When Whispering Smith did make it to the air in May 1961, it was met with low ratings, critical dismissal, and lambasted by politicians in a Senate subcommittee on TV violence, so this show met its demise in September 1961, leaving five episodes unaired.But now, its all here in this 3-DVD collection from TMG, the quality is quite good, similar their earlier releases of other classic shows like Riverbaot, The Tall Man, etc. under license from NBC Universal, and Audie Murphy excels in the title role as a Denver Police detective. Mitchell does a fine job as Romack, for their was good chemistry between these characters. It is not quite as violent as you would think, for there is way more violence in TV and movies today then there was then.

However, as stated earlier if you love Audie this won't and should not stop you from getting footage few have seen and now enjoy since the early 60's on NBC. There is also an interesting sound background the original producers used to fill in the scenes. They used a trombone (semi solo) which personally I would not have chosen but considering the lack of background music for TV developed to that point in time it is somewhat understandable.
