The list of songs is provided above, so you know what you're getting.  When you watch this DVD make sure you have enough time to see it to the end, because you won't want to turn it off.  This music is timeless, and you are getting every cent of your money's worth.  Nostalgia reigns supreme.  In adddition there are interviews with Patti Page, The Four Lads, Don Cherry, The Crew Cuts, Gogi Grant, and The Four Coins.  There is a companion DVD entitled ""More Magic Moments:  The Best of '50's Pop"" that was available for those who pledged on PBS.  However, it doesn't appear to be available for sale to the general public at this time.  It contains more of the wonderful same music.",5,This Is A Must For Anyone Who Remembers These Songs,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,739,"['DVD', '88', 'minutes', 'great', 'songs', '1950', 'list', 'songs', 'provided', 'above', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'When', 'watch', 'DVD', 'make', 'sure', 'have', 'enough', 'time', 'see', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'turn', 'off', 'music', 'timeless', 'are', 'getting', 'cent', 'money', 'worth', 'Nostalgia', 'reigns', 'supreme', 'adddition', 'are', 'interviews', 'Patti', 'Page', 'Four', 'Lads', 'Don', 'Cherry', 'Crew', 'Cuts', 'Gogi', 'Grant', 'Four', 'Coins', 'companion', 'DVD', 'entitled', 'More', 'Magic', 'Moments', 'Best', ""'50"", 'Pop', 'was', 'available', 'who', 'pledged', 'PBS', 'However', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'available', 'sale', 'general', 'public', 'time', 'more', 'wonderful', 'same', 'music']",N/A

Pat Boone seems to get a lot of attention, but he only sings part of a song (flash-back) and does a lot of talking. Poor Patti Page should have let them play the original version of her singing Old Cape Cod as she seems to have lost some of her voice range. It was great for me to see the Diamonds together again for the first time in many years. I have a feeling that this was not the complete show, and if I am right, that means they will come out with another DVD later on just to make more money. Over all, it makes for a nice night out (in your living room) with popcorn and soda pop or a malt. Invite your grand-children, they need to get away from what they have been living on.
