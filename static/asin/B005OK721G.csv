1496447,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005OK721G,,"[0, 0]","The seriously annoying trailer (""Never forget where you came from."") almost kept me from watching this film. But I consider Zoe Saldana to be a must-see performer, and so I caved. And, as it turns out, COLOMBIANA is nowhere near as funky as that lame trailer made it out to be. Zoe Saldana brings out the sultry and submits a strong acting performance. If only the script hadn't undercut her. COLOMBIANA can't seem to make up its mind on whether it's more an action film or a dramatic one. No, we don't quite get a seamless blend of the two genres.Child actress Amandla Stenberg, with her stillness and poise and haunting silences, deserves all manner of props. She carries the first half hour of the movie, and you can't take your eyes off her. Stenberg plays Cataleya, a 9-year-old girl in gang-infested Bogota whose parents are shot up to bits in front of her.Fifteen years later, an FBI profiler (Lennie James, always good) is obsessed with nabbing an assassin who's committed 22 gaudy murders within the past four years, never mind that each of the assassin's targets is a ""professional bad apple."" The FBI agent knows it's the same killer because he always marks his victims with an image of a Colombian orchid. Later he learns that the flower is called a ""cataleya."" Connect now your own dots.If I hadn't seen Gina Carano in bonecrunching action in HAYWIRE, I'd be even more rhapsodic over Zoe Saldana's action hero creds. As it is, Saldana evolves from her badasss role in THE LOSERS. Thrust that much more in the spotlight, she easily carries the bits of the film that Amandla Stenberg doesn't carry. The similarity between the two actresses is remarkable. So credit Zoe for capturing Amandla's sense of gravity about herself, and also that quiet fierceness. For her part, Zoe combines her dramatic skills - her Cataleya looks so desolate at times - with a dynamic and, frankly, very sexy physicality. I like that the grown-up Cataleya - and, yes, she grew up to be a professional assassin - is calculating and meticulous. She plans her contract hits. She carries out her plans flawlessly. But the closer she gets to her ultimate target - him what ordered the hit on her parents - she allows her emotions to get to her. She becomes sloppy. It costs her.Michael Vartan, by the way, serves as Saldana's love interest. It's almost not worth mentioning this.COLOMBIANA is style over substance, despite Saldana's powerhouse presence. The problem lies with several over-the-top moments, those inane flourishes which ultimately undermine the strong acting. There are two particularly egregious scenes. Early on, 9-year-old Cataleya's gangster tio, to prove some sort of point, takes out his gun in broad daylight, in front of an elementary school, and shoots off a round which sends a passing car careening into a halt. As police sirens wail, the tio delivers his lecture - something about education as a building block for all assassins-in-training - and then they just casually stroll away, with apparently no one having seen the guy firing his weapon. This is an absurd scene. The other laying-it-on-thick sequence involves pet sharks in a baddie's pool. One glance at that, and you just know Cataleya will be incorporating the sharks in one of her kills. When the payoff arrives, it happens as a quick one and done camera shot. It's a death dealt too quickly, and, gorehound that I am, I felt cheated.Zoe Saldana in graceful action is why I tuned in. If she has a calling card as a mighty arsekicker, it's that one brutal hand-to-hand combat scene late in the movie in which Saldana transforms a towel and three toothbrushes into deadly weapons. It's almost as good a sequence as Cataleya's layered infiltration of a police precinct. Providing you can overlook the film's silly excesses, you may find yourself immersed in COLOMBIANA. Saldana is terrific.Just remember: ""Never forget where you came from.""3.5 out of 5 stars.The DVD's bonus stuff:- ""COLOMBIANA: The Making Of"" featurette (00:25:07 minutes)- ""Cataleya's Journey"" - includes interviews with Zoe Saldana and Amandla Stenberg (00:09:31 minutes)",4,"The FBI guy: ""We're not looking for a woman.

1496456,A6AGN1U1BDB0V,B005OK721G,,"[11, 19]","At first I was going to give it two stars, but after thinking about it some more, I just couldn't bring myself to do it and downgraded it even more.  As someone else wrote in another review - to the director whether something makes sense is completely irrelevant and unimportant in a movie.First of all, I am Colombian and I have been in Colombia many times.  Sure there are ghettos like that, just like there are some here in the US so let me say one thing and maybe you can see where my view was ""corrected"".  The early scenes are filled with gun battles in these bad neighborhoods.  No cops show up and people just run through the city shooting and chasing with everyone just looking on or barely paying attention before going back to their TVs.  At first I though - hey, they are really doing a hatchet job on Colombia.  Even in the ghetto - you start a gun battle and the authorities will show up and NOT the police but the Army instead.  They don't have laws against the Army being involved in civil matters like we do here.  And the army is very well armed and trained for such events.  So like I said, at first I thought that this guy knows NOTHING about Colombia and he is just ignorant (which he is) but then soon after we end up in Chicago.Well, another scene occurs there and then I get it.  This director is just a total imbecil.  Another scene with shots ringing out, the police in this case DO show up but of course this guy and the little girl just walk away without any of the 50 onlookers pointing at them for the police to do anything.  The movie was just filled with garbage like that.  Yeah sure, in a US jail you can get around from room to room through the ventilation system.  Just open a vent in a cell and get almost anywhere you want to go.  Sure, enter a cell and have hair pins and stuff like that to pick a lock, because when you get arrested they don't take EVERYTHING away from you - minus your clothes because picking a lock with a hairpin is something the police have NEVER thought about themselves.Firing a high powered rifle from a building without being found out.  An Uzi 9mm that fires bullets as if they were from a 50 cal machinegun.  It just goes on and on.  What is the point about talking how stealthy she is when.... well, remember the Monty Python movies where the knight is seen in the distance and he keeps running towards the two guards - when finally he comes out of NOWHERE to kill them both.  It is JUST like that.  Sure, it is funny in a comedy - but this is not meant to be a comedy.  Yet when you use that type of stealthy maneuvering or camera cutaway scenes, it is just plain stupid.  If you are going to talk English then please don't do it with a stupid accent.  Either speak Spanish in the native tongue or speak English fluently please rather to than giving them some kind of stupid accent to make you think they are speaking Spanish.RPGs don't create fire like that either - that is not what they are designed for.  Why did she enter the shark tank in the first place? She got everywhere else she wanted to go by walking alongside walls, through vents, and sewer lines - how did she get into the pool in the first place?  Oh - for a cool effect! Being illogical isn't cool, it just takes you out of the fantasy of the movie.  Someone else mentioned in another review that women don't do all of that - shoot so many people without herself getting shot to pieces.  Well, to be fair NO man does that either without becoming Swiss cheese.  I am willing to give an action movie certain leeway (just like I would give any movie) when it comes to suspeding logic - but this goes WAY too far.",1,Two minus one Star,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,3646,"['first', 'was', 'going', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'thinking', 'more', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'do', 'downgraded', 'even', 'more', 'someone', 'else', 'wrote', 'review', 'director', 'something', 'sense', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'unimportant', 'movie.First', 'am', 'Colombian', 'have', 'been', 'Colombia', 'many', 'times', 'Sure', 'are', 'ghettos', 'just', 'are', 'here', 'US', 'let', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'maybe', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'view', 'was', 'corrected', 'early', 'scenes', 'are', 'filled', 'gun', 'battles', 'bad', 'neighborhoods', 'cops', 'show', 'up', 'people', 'just', 'run', 'city', 'shooting', 'chasing', 'everyone', 'just', 'looking', 'barely', 'paying', 'attention', 'going', 'back', 'TVs', 'first', 'hey', 'are', 'really', 'doing', 'hatchet', 'job', 'Colombia', 'Even', 'ghetto', 'start', 'gun', 'battle', 'authorities', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'NOT', 'police', 'Army', 'instead', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'laws', 'Army', 'being', 'involved', 'civil', 'matters', 'do', 'here', 'army', 'very', 'well', 'armed', 'trained', 'such', 'events', 'said', 'first', 'thought', 'guy', 'NOTHING', 'Colombia', 'just', 'ignorant', 'then', 'soon', 'end', 'up', 'Chicago.Well', 'scene', 'there', 'then', 'get', 'director', 'just', 'total', 'imbecil', 'scene', 'shots', 'ringing', 'out', 'police', 'case', 'DO', 'show', 'up', 'course', 'guy', 'little', 'girl', 'just', 'walk', 'away', '50', 'onlookers', 'pointing', 'police', 'do', 'anything', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'filled', 'garbage', 'Yeah', 'sure', 'US', 'jail', 'can', 'get', 'room', 'room', 'ventilation', 'system', 'Just', 'open', 'vent', 'cell', 'get', 'almost', 'anywhere', 'want', 'go', 'Sure', 'enter', 'cell', 'have', 'hair', 'pins', 'stuff', 'pick', 'lock', 'when', 'get', 'arrested', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'EVERYTHING', 'away', 'clothes', 'picking', 'lock', 'hairpin', 'something', 'police', 'have', 'NEVER', 'thought', 'themselves.Firing', 'high', 'powered', 'rifle', 'building', 'being', 'found', 'out', 'Uzi', '9mm', 'bullets', 'were', '50', 'cal', 'machinegun', 'just', 'What', 'point', 'talking', 'how', 'stealthy', 'when', 'well', 'remember', 'Monty', 'Python', 'movies', 'where', 'knight', 'seen', 'distance', 'running', 'towards', 'two', 'guards', 'when', 'finally', 'NOWHERE', 'kill', 'JUST', 'Sure', 'funny', 'comedy', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'comedy', 'when', 'use', 'type', 'stealthy', 'maneuvering', 'camera', 'cutaway', 'scenes', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'are', 'going', 'talk', 'English', 'then', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'stupid', 'accent', 'speak', 'Spanish', 'native', 'tongue', 'speak', 'English', 'fluently', 'rather', 'giving', 'kind', 'stupid', 'accent', 'make', 'think', 'are', 'speaking', 'Spanish.RPGs', 'do', ""n't"", 'create', 'fire', 'not', 'what', 'are', 'designed', 'Why', 'did', 'enter', 'shark', 'tank', 'first', 'place', 'got', 'everywhere', 'else', 'wanted', 'go', 'walking', 'alongside', 'walls', 'vents', 'sewer', 'lines', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'pool', 'first', 'place', 'Oh', 'cool', 'effect', 'Being', 'illogical', ""n't"", 'cool', 'just', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'Someone', 'else', 'mentioned', 'review', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'shoot', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'getting', 'shot', 'pieces', 'Well', 'be', 'fair', 'NO', 'man', 'becoming', 'Swiss', 'cheese', 'am', 'willing', 'give', 'action', 'movie', 'certain', 'leeway', 'just', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'when', 'suspeding', 'logic', 'WAY', 'too', 'far']",Colombiana

It meets the standards he set inThe Fifth ElementandLa Femme Nikita- very high standards.Two things truly stand out in this movie: the two actresses who played the central character, Cataleya. The young girl (Amandla Stenberg) was more than cute. She'll grow up to be a charmer, I'm sure, and did a great job in this role. Zoe Saldana makes this movie, though.

Zoe Saldana, as a young girl, sees her folks gunned down by a crime lord. She high-tails it from Columbia to the U.S. where she hooks up with her uncle, also on the wrong side of the law, where he teaches her how to be a top-notch hitman/woman. She does hits for her uncle while exacting revenge on anyone associated with her parents' killer. An FBI agent enters the fray trying to figure out who is performing these remarkable hits without leaving much in the way in clues.This is a Luc Besson written and produced flick and I'm surprised at how stupid some of the plot points were. This type of film needs to be clever and this was anything but. When we see her perform her first hit, in a jail no less, so many things happened that simply strained credulity. She has feigned drunkenness and, while supposedly sleeping it off, a guard leaves her a cup of coffee in a ceramic mug with a metal spoon. Maybe they do it like that in France, but in Chicago it's a paper cup and no spoon if there is any coffee at all!  Then she gets into her target's cell where he is asleep and wearing bling so big and heavy it could be used as a lethal weapon. Sorry. The bling stays at the booking desk. And the events that transpire giving the FBI agent the one clue he needs to track her down are so far beyond belief I'm amazed any writer could think he could possibly get away with it. The movie is replete with this sort of nonsense.As in all Besson projects, this has a slick sheen to it. It's shot and directed well. One hand to hand fight scene in the climax was about as good as anything I've seen. Music, editing and all that stuff are very top shelf. The performances from the key actors were as good as they could be given the script. But that's the problem. This suffered at the script level.

1496481,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005OK721G,,"[1, 2]","""Colombiana"" is a typical case of action flick that starts with the logo of EuropaCorp, a French studio co-founded by Luc Besson. The film, which stars Zoe Saldana (""Avatar"") as a deadly assassin, is yet another Luc Besson's collaboration with writer Robert Mark Kamen, a team that gave us such films as ""The Transporter"" and ""Taken,"" but several elements in the story may remind us of Besson's earlier films like ""Nikita"" and ""L&eacute;on."" (It is reported that ""Colombiana"" was originally conceived as a sequel to ""L&eacute;on,"" which I don't think is a great idea.) What you get instead is ""Colombiana,"" a decent action flick in which Zoe Saldana delivers a strong action-heroine performance, even though the film itself leaves much to be desired.In ""Colombiana"" Zoe Saldana plays Cataleya, who as a 10-year-old child saw her own parents killed in Bogota, Colombia. Raised by her gangster uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis) in Chicago, Cataleya works for him as a professional assassin, while attempting to track down those who are responsible for her parents' deaths. Cataleya also falls in love with a man named Danny (Michael Vartan), who doesn't know Cataleya's true identity.""Colombiana"" is directed by Olivier Megaton, known for ""Transporter 3,"" the weakest entry in the Jason Statham franchise. I admit the film's action sequences of ""Colombiana"" are not bad, especially in the film's opening section, though they are undermined by the director's hectic camerawork and editing.

1496494,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005OK721G,,"[2, 3]","There was a time when revenge films played in drive ins across the country. Low budget efforts that made stars of actors like Charles Bronson and Jan Michael Vincent were hits and led them to bigger and better things. These films were so successful that major studios began making them as well. COLUMBIANA shows that they continue to do so.In 1992, nine year old Catalyea witnesses the murder of her mother and father in Bogot&aacute;, Columbia. Her father did the killing for a cartel leader and although they swear allegiance, neither actually trust one another. Questioned by the leader of the killers, Cataleya she sticks a knife through his hand and then runs off using a plan her father gave her. Once in the states she finds her way to her uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis) and tells him she wants to be trained as a killer.Fast forward 12 years and we now see Cataleya all grown up in the form of actress Zoe Saldana. Pretending to be a drunk driver she gets herself arrested and locked up for the night. In reality she's stone cold sober and using the arrest as a ruse to get close to a special prisoner. Using methods taught to her over the years, she escapes her cell, kills the prisoner and returns to her cell before anyone is suspicious. The next morning she leaves before the jail is locked down.Cataleya has fulfilled her destiny and desire to become a leading contract killer. Her one flaw is that she leaves a drawing of a cataleya, an orchid, on each of her victims. She's done so in hopes that it will draw out Don Luis, the man who had her father killed. The killings so far have paid her well and provided her with experience. Now she wants to use it for the promise she made at age nine.Small subplots are found as well. Cataleya has a lover, an artist named Danny (Michael Vartan) she shares a bed with but no information. To be close to someone would present the possibility of dividing her attention or possibly losing them. We also have a determined FBI agent named Ross (Lennie James) who is closing in on this mystery killer they call the Tag killer due to her artwork on the victims.Cataleya takes on one more job before the police finally discuss her tags with the press and force Don Luis out of hiding. Taken in as an informant by the CIA, he's in New Orleans under their care, still running his drug business on the side. When he discovers who this killer is he sends his men to wipe her and any family members out. But to do so will do nothing more than make her motivation stronger than ever.COLOMBIANA was hyped as being from the same people who made TAKEN. While there are connections the film isn't nearly as good. Yes, it provides plenty of action, violence and explosions but the story isn't quite as interesting.Zoe Saldana in the lead shows that she can act and do so well enough to take the lead in a major motion picture. Each role she's taken in the past has led her this direction and now one could say she's achieved the status of star enough that she can carry a film on her own.All that said I find this movie more in the so-so category, a movie that provides the basics of what is expected in an action film these days but never quite makes it one that you'll want to watch over and over again. It includes all of the traits of the genre but never quite pulls you in in the same way TAKEN did. If you're going to tout the connection between one movie and another you'd better make sure it's as good if not better.But it does offer a nice evening's entertainment when the comparison is tossed aside. Perhaps those in charge of advertising would do better next time not to compare one movie to another. In doing so a decent movie would seem better on its own. COLUMBIANA is a decent action flick, but when compared to others it loses a few points.",3,REVENGE FILMS STILL EXIST,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,3790,"['was', 'time', 'when', 'revenge', 'films', 'played', 'drive', 'ins', 'country', 'Low', 'budget', 'efforts', 'made', 'stars', 'actors', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Jan', 'Michael', 'Vincent', 'were', 'hits', 'led', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'films', 'were', 'so', 'successful', 'major', 'studios', 'began', 'making', 'as', 'well', 'COLUMBIANA', 'continue', 'do', 'so.In', '1992', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'Catalyea', 'murder', 'mother', 'father', 'Bogot', 'aacute', 'Columbia', 'father', 'did', 'killing', 'cartel', 'leader', 'swear', 'allegiance', 'actually', 'trust', 'one', 'Questioned', 'leader', 'killers', 'Cataleya', 'knife', 'hand', 'then', 'off', 'using', 'plan', 'father', 'gave', 'Once', 'states', 'way', 'uncle', 'Emilio', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'be', 'trained', 'killer.Fast', 'forward', '12', 'years', 'now', 'see', 'Cataleya', 'grown', 'up', 'form', 'actress', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Pretending', 'be', 'drunk', 'driver', 'arrested', 'locked', 'up', 'night', 'reality', 'stone', 'cold', 'sober', 'using', 'arrest', 'ruse', 'get', 'close', 'special', 'prisoner', 'Using', 'methods', 'taught', 'years', 'cell', 'prisoner', 'returns', 'cell', 'anyone', 'suspicious', 'next', 'morning', 'jail', 'locked', 'down.Cataleya', 'fulfilled', 'destiny', 'desire', 'become', 'leading', 'contract', 'killer', 'one', 'flaw', 'drawing', 'cataleya', 'orchid', 'victims', 'done', 'so', 'hopes', 'will', 'draw', 'out', 'Don', 'Luis', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'father', 'killed', 'killings', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'paid', 'well', 'provided', 'experience', 'Now', 'use', 'promise', 'made', 'age', 'nine.Small', 'subplots', 'are', 'found', 'well', 'Cataleya', 'lover', 'artist', 'named', 'Danny', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'shares', 'bed', 'information', 'be', 'close', 'someone', 'would', 'present', 'possibility', 'dividing', 'attention', 'possibly', 'losing', 'also', 'have', 'determined', 'FBI', 'agent', 'named', 'Ross', 'Lennie', 'James', 'who', 'closing', 'mystery', 'killer', 'call', 'Tag', 'killer', 'due', 'artwork', 'victims.Cataleya', 'one', 'more', 'job', 'police', 'finally', 'tags', 'press', 'force', 'Don', 'Luis', 'hiding', 'Taken', 'informant', 'CIA', 'New', 'Orleans', 'care', 'still', 'running', 'drug', 'business', 'side', 'When', 'who', 'killer', 'men', 'wipe', 'family', 'members', 'out', 'do', 'so', 'will', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'make', 'motivation', 'stronger', 'ever.COLOMBIANA', 'was', 'hyped', 'being', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'TAKEN', 'are', 'connections', 'film', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Yes', 'plenty', 'action', 'violence', 'explosions', 'story', ""n't"", 'quite', 'interesting.Zoe', 'Saldana', 'lead', 'can', 'act', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'enough', 'take', 'lead', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'role', 'taken', 'past', 'led', 'direction', 'now', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'achieved', 'status', 'star', 'enough', 'can', 'carry', 'film', 'own.All', 'said', 'find', 'movie', 'more', 'so-so', 'category', 'movie', 'basics', 'what', 'expected', 'action', 'film', 'days', 'never', 'quite', 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'traits', 'genre', 'never', 'quite', 'same', 'way', 'TAKEN', 'did', ""'re"", 'going', 'tout', 'connection', 'one', 'movie', ""'d"", 'better', 'make', 'sure', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better.But', 'offer', 'nice', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'when', 'comparison', 'tossed', 'aside', 'Perhaps', 'charge', 'advertising', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'next', 'time', 'not', 'compare', 'one', 'movie', 'doing', 'so', 'decent', 'movie', 'would', 'seem', 'better', 'own', 'COLUMBIANA', 'decent', 'action', 'flick', 'when', 'compared', 'others', 'few', 'points']",Colombiana

And the little girl witnesses it and she manages to get away and swears revenge.Throughout the movie she kills many people who are thieves, criminals, drug dealers, etc. in order to draw out the guy who killed her parents.  She finally manages to find where he is hiding and she decides to take off the kid gloves.  No more sneaking around, being stealthy, she breaks out the big guns and goes in with guns blazing and she cuts a bloody swath of destruction through the guy's fortress and takes him out.I really can't think of anything wrong with this movie or anything that I would change if I had the chance to remake it myself.

1496503,A2WNF5CG0WTPVA,B005OK721G,,"[4, 12]","The scoop: In Columbia, a family man is looking to get out of the drug business for reasons unclear. Of course, his boss says, ""Sure, pal o' mine, just don't tell the drug police about me, ha ha!"" Of course, anyone that's seen many crime movies -- including these characters -- knows that ""the only way out is feet first, got that?"" A hit squad is dispatched to eliminate the guy and his family.  The parents know the hit squad is en route--in fact, they spot them outside!--yet make NO effort to hide their 11-year-old daughter Cataleya as they approach. (Perhaps the real reason this couple was marked for death is because this drug kingpin realized this couple has crappy parenting skills.) Husband and wife are shot multiple times in front of the child.  Faster than you can say ""Bruce Wayne,"" she vows then & there to avenge her parents' murder and escapes. But Bruce Wayne trained for years and years in almost every physical discipline imaginable before he became Batman, THIS little girl has the moves of Daredevil and Angelina Jolie's Ms. Salt at the age of eleven, jumping from rooftop to rooftop to street, evading a crew of what must be between four and eight fully grown, heavily armed, presumably professional hitmen. (Cripes, what did they feed this kid?!?) We even see this child move a MANHOLE COVER like it's a pizza! (Gad, those things are heavy, really!) Then, from an unlikely confluence of events, Cataleya -- who is so special she reads Xena comic books YEARS before the hit TV show makes the airwaves, according to the film's timeline -- makes her way from Columbia to Miami to Chicago (most bus companies will let a pre-teen girl buy a ticket sans adult supervision), where she hooks up with her gangster uncle.  Uncle Thug, like all concerned relatives, honors his niece's burning desire to be trained as an assassin, provided she attends school regularly and kills the Kardashian sisters after turning 21. (OK, I made-up that last bit.)That was the prologue -- cut to the present, where the child has grown up to be Zoe Saldana. Ms. Saldana is indeed lovely, but let's be vaguely semi-real here. She looks like she weighs 94 pounds! She kicks an enormous amount of big-guy hiney and wields weapons that are almost as big as she is! Cagefighter-turned-actress Gina Carano, star of the recent Haywire, is a truly muscular lady -- you can believe that she can clean any guy's clock, punch his ticket, fix his wagon, and rotate his tires. Saldana looks like a stick figure...a very pretty stick figure I'll admit, but a stick figure nonetheless. Steve Buscemi could take her in a fight, and Buffy the V-Slayer could have her for breakfast. (I wouldn't bet the rent, but I think a MALE stunt-double was used in one fight scene).But wait, it gets better. [spoiler] I know this is an action film, not a documentary, but Starsky & Hutch feels more ""real"" than this movie. Early on, Cataleya gets herself arrested intentionally by pretending to be drunk and plowing her car into a police car. After she's arrested, the police don't give her a breathalyzer test, don't take her mugshot, and (best of all) don't take the hairpin in her, uh, hair with which she uses to unlock her cell door with ease!  (Do the CIA and NSA know of the awesome power of the pin, for MacGyver's sake?) [insert Andy Rooney voice here] Ever notice that in action movies ladies (and occasionally men) can run BAREfoot into sewers and over an assortment of rubble without stepping on something injurious?I like action movies as much as the next fellow, but I like some actual acting and characters (they're as generic as they come here) with my explosions and gunshots.

1496504,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B005OK721G,,"[4, 6]","Last week I saw Zoe Saldana being interviewed on Chelsea Lately. Up to that point I had not intended to see the movie. I thought she had a presence about her though, and when she mentioned it was a Luc Besson movie, whose name is synonymous with stylish thriller, I had to go.Throughout his illustrious film career as writer, producer and director, Luc Besson has crafted many thrillers featuring assassins. Most notably probablyLa Femme Nikita, which has now become two different tv series, and remade as an American movie starring Bridget Fonda, which lacked the killer instinct of the original. He wrote the characters for the Transporter movies starring Jason Statham, and the excellent movieTakenstarring Liam Neeson. LeonL&eacute;on: The Professional (Theatrical and Extended Edition) [Blu-ray], a personal favorite stars Natalie Portman in her first screen role, and he wrote Colombiana.While Colombiana may not distinguish itself particularly when compared with these other movies, what does distinguish it is Zoe Saldana. If looks could kill, she wouldn't need a weapon. So, when a young girl witnesses her parents murdered by a ruthless druglord, she demonstrates strange abilities, makes her way to America, joins her uncle. Picture a 10 year old saying to her uncle: ""I want to kill people, can you help?""So, she becomes an assassin, and finds creative ways of getting into the most secure places. She is like the mist. You may notice something visually captivating, and captivating in other ways too, about watching a woman in a sleek, figure revealing black one piece, doing all manner of things which demonstrate her flexibility and nimbleness, and wielding a weapon. It's quite sexy.In fact it's fair to say that Zoe Saldana elevates the movie, and shows that she has what it takes to play leading roles, and carry a movie at the box office. Yes, as you expect, you will find the usual crash bang wallop here too.So, I give the movie 6 out of 10 for quality, 8 out of 10 for style, and I give Zoe Saldana 10 out of 10, for her presence, charisma, and overall sexiness, which makes the movie 8 out of 10.And if you like this movie, and have not already seen the other ones I highlighted above, I highly recommend you check them out.

However, I like Zoe Saldana so I was going to see this movie regardless. And as much as I like her (beautiful, athletic, great actress, spunky), I zoned out and fell asleep. The movie was entirely too predictable. When I saw sharks, I was thinking, ""Yep, somebody is going to get eaten."" When I saw the kid with arms under the table, I was thinking, ""She's got to have something in her hands to be that still."" When she said (as a little girl) that she wanted to be a killer, I was thinking, ""Great, and she picked the perfect person to travel to."" When she went to the bathroom, I was thinking, ""Guess this is the part where she'll sneak out."" The whole movie went like that. I watched a scene, called out what would happen, and dropped my shoulders when it did just that.The only time I was caught off guard was when her character went to jail the first time. The way she played that DUI charge was smooth, and I had to give it to her. The problem was I just can't see her getting away with it, and the camera should've caught her somewhere along the lines. The cop who just couldn't believe a woman would do it, yeah, I'm not buying that either. If it was the '50s or '60s, yeah, maybe, but in this day and age, I can't see a cop going, ""A woman cannot possibly be this sneaky or violent or smart enough to do this."" (And I'm saying this from the perspective of someone who went to school late as a kid and encountered a cop who acted like I killed 20 people instead of allegedly cut class.)While I could dig the whole Xena Warrior Princess act, the random killings of innocent people as well as ""bad"" people didn't keep my interest. I couldn't cheer for her when she seemed like the bad guy the entire time. I really wanted to see this in a movie theater when I first heard about it.

The action kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.I love the beginning of the movie though it is heart breaking but there is a lot of action in it and quite entertaining.  And I am not a fan of action movies but this one really had a plot that I could follow.  And to a certain degree I can definitely relate to the feelings of the character.And I was comfortable with the love scenes.  They were not about raunchy sex but about how she has a void within her that needs to be filled with love and being connected and belonging to someone.  I love the scene where the boyfriend wants to learn about her and how she feels.  And her reaction really screams the theme of the story.And the cast they picked was awesome specifically for the Colombia scenes, it represented a group of Latins that are rarely shown to the world.

If the plot sounds familiar, it's probably because the premise is sort of a staple of the revenge thriller, and though Saldana gives the performance her all, there just isn't enough to set Colombiana apart. The movie not only fails to make an impression, but also suffers from erratic and sloppy filmmaking; it'll probably leave you unsatisfied, but if you've liked any of Besson's and Megaton's recent work, you may still find something to enjoy here.",1,Colombiana,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,978,"['handful', 'French', 'filmmaker', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'most', 'famous', 'films', 'penchant', 'femmes', 'fatale', 'titles', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Messenger', 'extent', 'Leon', 'Professional', 'Colombiana', 'Besson', 'wrote', 'produced', 'genre', 'help', 'director', 'Olivier', 'Megaton', 'result', 'uneven', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Colombian', 'woman', 'family', 'was', 'murdered', 'mobsters', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'Now', 'grown', 'woman', 'ruthless', 'assassin', 'out', 'path', 'revenge', 'plot', 'familiar', 'probably', 'premise', 'sort', 'staple', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'Saldana', 'performance', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'set', 'Colombiana', 'apart', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'impression', 'also', 'suffers', 'erratic', 'sloppy', 'filmmaking', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'leave', 'unsatisfied', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'Besson', 'Megaton', 'recent', 'work', 'may', 'still', 'find', 'something', 'enjoy', 'here']",Colombiana
1496508,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B005OK721G,,"[8, 12]","This is a film whose ambitions are blatantly clear:  it wants to combine the violent realism and shadowy intrigue of the Bourne series with the romantic chic and assassin's pop psych of Nikita and a dash of the high tech sophistication of Nathan Hunt.  Unfortunately, in spite of jerky-camera fight scenes and elaborate scenarios with the sinuously stunningly beautiful Saldana in tight body suits, the film doesn't quite work.  Even worse for an action film, I had this nagging critical voice at the back of my mind that continually reminded me that someone was making this all up - I could not suspend my disbelief and just watch.The story is about a girl who decided to become an assassin after she witnesses the violent death of her parents.  Right away, it appears unbelievable.  At 9, in a school girls uniform, she escapes a gang of seasoned murderers in a chase through the slum streets of Bogota, vowing revenge and making her way to Chicago relatives.  Skip to the future, and she executes a number of technically perfect assassinations - with none of the ""things that go wrong"" improvisations that make great caper films so much fun - while finding out more and more about her father's murderer.  Of course, throw in a little corruption and intrigue, and you get the same old formula.  Then there is a climax, she can't go back to her handsome lover, and survives for sequels (assuming this make enough money).Saldana and the other actors are indisputably talented and often give gifted performances.  The action scenes are fun, if too clean and in the end somewhat incoherent.  In one scene, she gets jailed on purpose, escapes to kill some prisoner, and gets back in her cell, framing a guard by using his gun and getting released.  The FBI then correlates a random photo they find on a police databank (sent by her lover's friend, who wants to help him identify her) with the security camera images of her nose and hands, all in a few seconds.  It was laughably unbelievable.I would recommend this as background fun.  But it is a 3-star performance from a first-rate talent like Besson.",3,"tries hard, but this is a comic-book film",1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,2100,"['film', 'ambitions', 'are', 'blatantly', 'clear', 'combine', 'violent', 'realism', 'shadowy', 'intrigue', 'Bourne', 'series', 'romantic', 'chic', 'assassin', 'pop', 'psych', 'Nikita', 'dash', 'high', 'tech', 'sophistication', 'Nathan', 'Hunt', 'Unfortunately', 'spite', 'jerky-camera', 'fight', 'scenes', 'elaborate', 'scenarios', 'sinuously', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Saldana', 'tight', 'body', 'suits', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'Even', 'worse', 'action', 'film', 'had', 'nagging', 'critical', 'voice', 'back', 'mind', 'continually', 'reminded', 'someone', 'was', 'making', 'could', 'not', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'just', 'watch.The', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'decided', 'become', 'assassin', 'violent', 'death', 'parents', 'Right', 'away', 'unbelievable', '9', 'school', 'girls', 'uniform', 'gang', 'seasoned', 'murderers', 'chase', 'slum', 'streets', 'Bogota', 'vowing', 'revenge', 'making', 'way', 'Chicago', 'relatives', 'Skip', 'future', 'number', 'technically', 'perfect', 'assassinations', 'none', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'improvisations', 'make', 'great', 'caper', 'films', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'finding', 'out', 'more', 'more', 'father', 'murderer', 'course', 'throw', 'little', 'corruption', 'intrigue', 'get', 'same', 'old', 'formula', 'Then', 'climax', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'handsome', 'lover', 'sequels', 'assuming', 'make', 'enough', 'money', '.Saldana', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'indisputably', 'talented', 'often', 'give', 'gifted', 'performances', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'too', 'clean', 'end', 'somewhat', 'incoherent', 'one', 'scene', 'jailed', 'purpose', 'kill', 'prisoner', 'back', 'cell', 'framing', 'guard', 'using', 'gun', 'getting', 'released', 'FBI', 'then', 'random', 'photo', 'find', 'police', 'databank', 'sent', 'lover', 'friend', 'who', 'help', 'identify', 'security', 'camera', 'images', 'nose', 'hands', 'few', 'seconds', 'was', 'laughably', 'unbelievable.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'background', 'fun', '3-star', 'performance', 'first-rate', 'talent', 'Besson']",Colombiana

This movie moves at the pace I like and often kept me and my daughter on edge to see what happens next.I recommend this movie and since I now own it I can watch it often, Zoe should be the 1st Woman &#34;Jane Bond&#34;.
