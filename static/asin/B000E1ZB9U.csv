The story of Pym's father's childhood is dropped and the first of three chronolgoically presented Pyms, the child, is a bit too strange though clearly manipulative. The second Pym is a good actor without rating a wow. But the actor playing the mature Pym is great, and the second half of the filming is something very special indeed.The movie covers many years, and a viewer should realize this is for the most part a slowly paced internal drama, and not a Bond-like adventure film.It is also NOT a film for children or teenagers.The film is very tough emotionally - life in this film is definitely not sugar-coated: women are especially badly treated.

966693,A6QMY5WPTVAT1,B000E1ZB9U,"Gregory J. Casteel ""Dr. Gregory J. Casteel""","[0, 0]","I'm pretty sure that ""A Perfect Spy"" was the first John le Carr&eacute; novel I ever bought and read.  It had to have been at least twenty years ago, so my memory is a bit fuzzy; but I believe that this was my introduction to le Carr&eacute; in written form.  (I had previously seen at least a couple of movies and a TV miniseries based on some of le Carr&eacute;'s other novels; but this was the first one of his books that I actually read.)  Since then I have read most of John le Carr&eacute;'s other spy novels; and I consider myself a fan of his work.  But it's been a long, long time since I've read ""A Perfect Spy""; and I had forgotten most of the details of the story.  So, to be perfectly honest, I can't really say how closely this miniseries follows the plot of the book.  As I was watching it this past weekend, the characters and storyline seemed familiar, but only vaguely so.  Oddly enough, I never saw this miniseries when it aired on TV back in the early 1990s.  (It was a BBC production; but it was rebroadcast in the US as part of the PBS series ""Masterpiece Theatre"".)  In fact, I didn't even know that this miniseries existed until I came across the DVDs here on Amazon.  I'm glad I finally got to watch it.  (Better late than never, I suppose.)  As I said, I don't recall how closely it follows the book, but it definitely has the ""feel"" of a John le Carr&eacute; story; and, as a fan of le Carr&eacute;'s work, I found it quite satisfying.This seven-part miniseries tells the life story of Magnus Pym, the son of a con man who grows up to become a spy.  Beginning in Pym's early childhood, we see how his unusual upbringing shapes his character, turning him into a charming liar with no moral compass and a gift for getting people to trust him.  This is what ultimately makes Pym the perfect spy.  We watch Pym grow up and see how his unique life experiences ultimately lead him into espionage.  But we also see how the ghosts of his past affect the choices he makes in the present.  John le Carr&eacute; writes realistic spy stories that are complex, layered, and deep.  His stories are really about people, and why they do the things they do.  It just so happens that the people he writes about are spies.  They make interesting characters because they inhabit a shadowy world of secrets and lies, where the normal rules of moral behavior in a civilized society don't apply, and it's often hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys.  The thing that sets le Carr&eacute; apart from other writers of spy fiction is the way he captures, and subtly critiques, the moral ambiguity of the world of espionage.  He doesn't give us noble heroes and dastardly villains.  He simply gives us people -- realistically imperfect human beings -- all of whom are morally compromised in one way or another.  This is what we see in this miniseries.  If you're looking for mindless action in the style of James Bond or Jason Bourne, look elsewhere.  This miniseries is slow-paced and cerebral, with very little violence or action of any kind.  It's simply not that sort of spy story.  It's really not about the art of espionage at all.  Instead, it's an in-depth character study of Magnus Pym and why he did the things he did.  It's fascinating from a psychological standpoint; but anyone who watches this expecting it to be some sort of fast-paced thriller is likely to be bored to tears.  I should also point out that it does contain some brief nudity and strong language (though not a lot of it), which some viewers might not be comfortable with.If you're already a John le Carr&eacute; fan you should definitely get this.  If you're not already familiar with le Carr&eacute;'s works, several of which have been made into movies (including ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"", ""The Russia House"", and ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy""), then the only thing I can say is that I think it's a great story that's worth watching; but it's definitely not for everyone, especially those with short attention spans.",5,A treat for John le Carr&eacute; fans,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,4012,"[""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'Perfect', 'Spy', 'was', 'first', 'John', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'ever', 'bought', 'read', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'memory', 'bit', 'fuzzy', 'believe', 'was', 'introduction', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'written', 'form', 'had', 'previously', 'seen', 'least', 'couple', 'movies', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'based', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'other', 'novels', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'books', 'actually', 'read', 'then', 'have', 'read', 'most', 'John', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'other', 'spy', 'novels', 'consider', 'fan', 'work', 'been', 'long', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Perfect', 'Spy', 'had', 'forgotten', 'most', 'details', 'story', 'So', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'how', 'closely', 'miniseries', 'plot', 'book', 'was', 'watching', 'past', 'weekend', 'characters', 'storyline', 'seemed', 'familiar', 'only', 'vaguely', 'so', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'never', 'saw', 'miniseries', 'when', 'aired', 'TV', 'back', 'early', '1990s', 'was', 'BBC', 'production', 'was', 'rebroadcast', 'US', 'part', 'PBS', 'series', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'miniseries', 'existed', 'came', 'DVDs', 'here', 'Amazon', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'got', 'watch', 'Better', 'late', 'never', 'suppose', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'how', 'closely', 'book', 'definitely', 'feel', 'John', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'story', 'fan', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'work', 'found', 'quite', 'satisfying.This', 'seven-part', 'miniseries', 'life', 'story', 'Magnus', 'Pym', 'son', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'up', 'become', 'spy', 'Beginning', 'Pym', 'early', 'childhood', 'see', 'how', 'unusual', 'upbringing', 'shapes', 'character', 'turning', 'charming', 'liar', 'moral', 'compass', 'gift', 'getting', 'people', 'trust', 'what', 'ultimately', 'Pym', 'perfect', 'spy', 'watch', 'Pym', 'grow', 'up', 'see', 'how', 'unique', 'life', 'experiences', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'espionage', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'ghosts', 'past', 'affect', 'choices', 'present', 'John', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'realistic', 'spy', 'stories', 'are', 'complex', 'layered', 'deep', 'stories', 'are', 'really', 'people', 'why', 'do', 'things', 'do', 'just', 'so', 'people', 'are', 'spies', 'make', 'interesting', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'shadowy', 'world', 'secrets', 'lies', 'where', 'normal', 'rules', 'moral', 'behavior', 'civilized', 'society', 'do', ""n't"", 'apply', 'often', 'hard', 'tell', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'thing', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'apart', 'other', 'writers', 'spy', 'fiction', 'way', 'subtly', 'critiques', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'world', 'espionage', ""n't"", 'give', 'noble', 'heroes', 'dastardly', 'villains', 'simply', 'people', 'realistically', 'imperfect', 'human', 'beings', 'whom', 'are', 'morally', 'compromised', 'one', 'way', 'what', 'see', 'miniseries', ""'re"", 'looking', 'mindless', 'action', 'style', 'James', 'Bond', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'miniseries', 'slow-paced', 'cerebral', 'very', 'little', 'violence', 'action', 'kind', 'simply', 'not', 'sort', 'spy', 'story', 'really', 'not', 'art', 'espionage', 'Instead', 'in-depth', 'character', 'study', 'Magnus', 'Pym', 'why', 'did', 'things', 'did', 'fascinating', 'psychological', 'standpoint', 'anyone', 'who', 'expecting', 'be', 'sort', 'fast-paced', 'thriller', 'likely', 'be', 'bored', 'tears', 'should', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'contain', 'brief', 'nudity', 'strong', 'language', 'not', 'lot', 'viewers', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'comfortable', 'with.If', ""'re"", 'already', 'John', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'fan', 'should', 'definitely', 'get', ""'re"", 'not', 'already', 'familiar', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'works', 'several', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'movies', 'including', 'Spy', 'Who', 'Came', 'Cold', 'Russia', 'House', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'then', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'think', 'great', 'story', 'worth', 'watching', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'especially', 'short', 'attention', 'spans']",N/A

966698,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B000E1ZB9U,Matthew Kresal,"[8, 8]","As a fan of author John le Carre I've slowly been working my way through both his books and the adaptations of them. I found this 1987 adaptation of le Carre's masterwork originaly at my local library before I eventually bought this DVD and sat down to watch it thinking I would know what to expect. I was surprised to discover that my expectations were exceeded in this miniseries, a fine cross between a spy thriller and a human drama.Peter Egan gives a great performance as Magnus Pym, the perfect spy of the title. Carrying on in the long tradition of le Carre's strong main characters, Pym is also quite possibly the best. Egan plays Pym (who in fact contains many shades of author le Carre) as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and betraying sometimes out of circumstance and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming ""a perfect spy"". Egan plays Pym to perfection as a man always on the run, if not from others then from himself. Egan alone makes the six or so hours of this miniseries worth seeing from his performance alone.Surronding Egan is a fantastic supporting cast. Ray McAnally gives one of his finest performances as Pym's con man father Rick who (as le Carre has said) is based strongly on the author's own father. McAnally plays a man who comes in and out of Pym's life and is one of the those responsible for Pym becoming ""a perfect spy"". In fact if it wasn't for McAnally's performance a year after this in A Very British Coup this would the finest performance of his sadly too short career.The rest of the supporting is excellent as well. From Caroline John as Pym's mother to Alan Howard as his spy mentor to R&uuml;diger Weigang as the young Pym's friend turned controller to Jane Booker as Pym's wife the supporting cast is fantastic. Special mention should be made of the three young actors who played the younger Pym (Jonathan Haley, Nicholas Haley and Benedict Taylor) who establish the young man who would become the man played so well By Peter Egan.The production values of the miniseries are strong as well. As the miniseries adaptations of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley's People proved these stories can only be told in miniseries format. The locations are excellent from the English locations to the those scattered across Eastern Europe and the USA as are the sets by Chris Edwards. The cinematography of Elmer Cossey adds an extra layer of realism to the world of the miniseries. Yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script.Screenwrtier Arthur Hopcraft tackled the job of adapting the six hundred or so page novel excellently. The novel was largely (at least in its early parts) autobiographical in that Pym's early life echoed much of John le Carre's life. The script for this miniseries is no exception as it traces the development of Magnus Pym from young boy to ""a perfect spy"". Never once does the miniseries deviate from its purpose of telling a fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage. If one ever wants proof that a spy thriller can be tense and fascinating without ever having one gun fight, fist fight, or James Bond style car chase this would be the proof. While the miniseries is six plus hours long it never wastes a moment and it all the better for it.Though it might be overlong for some for those who don't have very short attention spans here is a must see. From the performances of Peter Egan and Ray McAnally to fine production values and a fine literary script A Perfect Spy is one of the finest miniseries who can expect to see.

This is different, as others have mentioned.  It is not as much about the intrigues of the spy business as it is the internal workings of one man who is caught up in the business.I hadn't realized that Le Carre had had a background similar to that of the main character, Magnus Pym, until I read it here.  That gives another dimension of pathos to the story.  It would be interesting to me to know just how much of Pym's story was similar to LeCarre's.  Of course we'd all like to know if LC actually passed information to the Communists but we'll probably never know that.  Mostly I wonder how deeply the pattern of deceipt and betrayal that did-in Pym was operative in LC's life.  At any rate LC survived and did very well with his life---that's a happy ending.I thought the whole production lived up to the usual excellent BBC standards.  I loved the choice of Peter Egan as Pym.  His very good looks and natural charm made a terribly touching contrast to his inner life.  He has an almost childlike ability to be affectionate, as seen most strikingly in the last scenes with the landlady, that just break your heart.  The relationship to Poppy is very remarkable too.

966700,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000E1ZB9U,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","It took me a while to warm up to this series and get it.  Up to nearly the end, I thought it was too slow and convoluted.  It takes a deep look at the spy's psychology:  his father was a charming con man, either in the money or broke, even in jail; yet he always resurfaces, even to run for parliament.  The boy is ashamed of him, loves him, feels guilt and responsibility towards him and never free.  It is pathetic, yet his recruiters for ""the firm"" think a little crime in the family is a fine thing.The young man inherits the charm of his father and is apparently talented, at least if admission to Oxford means anything.  He proves adept at gathering information discreetly, rarely regrets his betrayals, to the point that it is clear he is the same kind of sociopath his father is = he marries women he doesn't love for ""cover"" and eventually compromises himself because there is a need inside him that cannot be fulfilled.  (I reveal nothing here, for his journey to this is what is important.  It is subtle and complex, as we expect from Le Carre, and it is not spelled but must be interpreted, which is one thing I love about European film.)  He is seduced and makes a career that makes a mockery of his colleagues and indeed the entire intelligence service.  Of course, it works itself to a terrible crisis, not at all what one would expect.  The spy, Pym, disappears, but the look of nervous exhaustion is unmistakeable and, I thought, believable.Though I found it difficult to understand what exactly the spy was supposed to be doing and what he did, it is revealed slowly.  Perhaps too slowly.  It does work very well in the end as a drama, but it may lose many viewers before the climax.  Recommended.

966702,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000E1ZB9U,Stephanie De Pue,"[13, 16]","""A Perfect Spy"" was the third of Britisher John LeCarre's cold war spy novels to be filmed for television by the British Broadcasting Company.  As they generally did at that time, they threw money at the screen: script by the talented Arthur Hopcraft, who'd previously done the honors for the same author's ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"" and ""Smiley's People;"" location filming in glamorous places, extras and cars galore.  Yet it's just not the same ""must-see tv"" as its stablemates.Magnus Pym, played by Peter Egan, is here the perfect spy, double-dealing with zest.  We are apparently supposed to think he's like this because his father Rik(Ray McAnally, who died soon after filming was completed) was an outside-the-law confidence trickster who enjoyed his work, and maybe that is enough to explain the son's behavior, who knows.  It's certainly noticeable that most viewers will not find either main character particularly likeable;whereas Rik and his troops seem at least always to be having a good time, Magnus is portrayed as being a nasty little boy from the beginning.  Interestingly enough, we must assume this material is intensely personal to its author.  He's described his own father as a conman, and both author and his character Magnus have studied and worked in the German-speaking world.  In fact, he's repeated these elements in several books, as he's repeated the seaside hideout, even the nickname ""Tiger,"" here, used by father to son; in ""Single and Single,"" the conman father is called ""Tiger"" himself.So why doesn't it work?  To begin with, it's seven episodes, the riveting ""Tinker"" and ""Smiley"" are only six.  And the other two series have many sharply-drawn, memorable characters, plus attention-grabbing plots.  There are many fewer characters here, they're not nearly as flavorful, and the plot, especially as it's a downer, doesn't really seem to need so many episodes.  Furthermore, aside from McAnally, and Dame Peggy Ashcroft in an important supporting role, the Beeb seems to have stinted on the leading and supporting roles.  Many of these actors are just not as expressive as they could be.  A lot of viewers might find they are tempted to forget that third disk.",3,It's Not Must-See TV,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,2198,"['Perfect', 'Spy', 'was', 'third', 'Britisher', 'John', 'LeCarre', 'cold', 'war', 'spy', 'novels', 'be', 'filmed', 'television', 'British', 'Broadcasting', 'Company', 'generally', 'did', 'time', 'threw', 'money', 'screen', 'script', 'talented', 'Arthur', 'Hopcraft', 'who', ""'d"", 'previously', 'done', 'honors', 'same', 'author', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'Smiley', 'People', 'location', 'filming', 'glamorous', 'places', 'extras', 'cars', 'galore', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'must-see', 'tv', 'stablemates.Magnus', 'Pym', 'played', 'Peter', 'Egan', 'here', 'perfect', 'spy', 'double-dealing', 'zest', 'are', 'apparently', 'supposed', 'think', 'father', 'Rik', 'Ray', 'McAnally', 'who', 'died', 'soon', 'filming', 'was', 'completed', 'was', 'outside-the-law', 'confidence', 'trickster', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'work', 'maybe', 'enough', 'explain', 'son', 'behavior', 'who', 'certainly', 'noticeable', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'either', 'main', 'character', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'whereas', 'Rik', 'troops', 'seem', 'least', 'always', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'Magnus', 'portrayed', 'being', 'nasty', 'little', 'boy', 'beginning', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'must', 'assume', 'material', 'intensely', 'personal', 'author', 'described', 'own', 'father', 'conman', 'author', 'character', 'Magnus', 'have', 'studied', 'worked', 'German-speaking', 'world', 'fact', 'repeated', 'elements', 'several', 'books', 'repeated', 'seaside', 'hideout', 'even', 'nickname', 'Tiger', 'here', 'used', 'father', 'son', 'Single', 'Single', 'conman', 'father', 'called', 'Tiger', 'himself.So', 'why', ""n't"", 'work', 'begin', 'seven', 'episodes', 'riveting', 'Tinker', 'Smiley', 'are', 'only', 'six', 'other', 'two', 'series', 'have', 'many', 'sharply-drawn', 'memorable', 'characters', 'attention-grabbing', 'plots', 'are', 'many', 'fewer', 'characters', 'here', ""'re"", 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'flavorful', 'plot', 'especially', 'downer', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'need', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'Furthermore', 'aside', 'McAnally', 'Dame', 'Peggy', 'Ashcroft', 'important', 'supporting', 'role', 'Beeb', 'have', 'stinted', 'leading', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Many', 'actors', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'expressive', 'could', 'be', 'lot', 'viewers', 'might', 'find', 'are', 'tempted', 'forget', 'third', 'disk']",N/A

The novel works on two time lines; the first one follows the search for Magnus Pym who has disappeared and the second one follows his reminiscences of his life as he hides in a seaside hotel. The book jumps back and forth, and while the US, UK, and Czech secret services are all looking for him, we are wondering why Pym went into hiding and why he seems scared and relaxed all at once. In the miniseries, we don't much care about Magnus at all. The only thing I cared about was when would Pym senior reappear.The Ugly: Peter Egan as Magnus Pym. Completely wrong. In the book Magnus Pym was very much like his father, seductive and charming, which is why he was such a successful spy. In the mini series, Pym is unimposing and weak. It's difficult to believe he can convince anyone to trust him.Very disappointing. Apart from McAnally, Rudiger Weigang as Pym's college friend and Czech contact gives a hammy but good performance.
