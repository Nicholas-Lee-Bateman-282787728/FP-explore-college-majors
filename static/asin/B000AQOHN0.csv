The last film I saw that was this assured and easy to watch was Silver Linings Playbook. Saving Face manages to be as much fun as films like that without needing the extra-heavy or crazy parts... it's just a straightforward slice-of-life story with just enough unpredictability to stay funny throughout. The only reason I can imagine for anyone (who likes this type of film) not to enjoy it would be its format: it has 40% English dialog, but the 60% in subtitled Mandarin and the central lesbian relationship might deter a few people (who seem to have given the movie one star here).

The one quibble I have with it is that I thought the subtitling could have been better. I would have loved it if they could have had an option for English subtitles when there is Mandarin being spoken and Chinese subtitles preferably Traditional when there is English being spoken. I know it's possible because I once saw a documentary on The Rasmus and there was English subtitles when there was Finnish spoken and vice versa.

931439,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000AQOHN0,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","Then first-time director/writer Alice Wu's ""Saving Face"" is a film that demonstrates considerable charm and polish. It's a very enjoyable piece of work, made all the more fulfilling by knowing that it's based on her own experiences in coming out and the reaction to that in her Chinese-American family and circle.Wu's real coup was in getting the regal and beautiful Joan Chen to star in her work.  Ms. Chen - still drop-dead gorgeous at a still-young 48 - is scandalously under-used by Hollywood.  She hides her impeccable English behind the fences here and delivers all her lines in Mandarin.  Her interactions with online screen daughter Wilhelmina ('Wil' - nicely played by a very likable Michelle Krusiec) have a very real-life feel to them.  You get the feeling that Ms. Wu lived many of these scenes.  Still, Chen and Krusiec are a very believable mother-daughter.  In truth, only 13 years separate the two actresses, but Krusiec's pixie-like build and youthful face make it work.  At the time of the movie's release, Krusiec is 31 playing 27, Chen 44 playing 48.  Lynn Chen is also winning as Wil's love interest Vivian. It's a very strong trio, given some superb direction.I was very excited to learn (via IMDB) of Alice Wu's next project: an adaptation of one of my favorite books, Rachel DeWoskin'sForeign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China.  I always thought that would make an excellent movie.

931442,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B000AQOHN0,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[1, 1]","If a romantic comedy with complex mother/daughter issues at its core is what you are looking for, then take a chance on Alice Wu`s debut effort,`Saving Face.`  A charming and funny tale, `Saving Face` is really two stories welded into one.  The central plot revolves around a blossoming romance between two successful Chinese-Americans (both smartly played by attractive newcomers, Michelle Krusiec and Lynn Chen).  As one of the girl`s mothers, veteran actress Joan Chen gives a grand performance as a middle-aged immigrant woman caught up in her own secret dilemma.Wilhelmina (Krusiec) is a driven NYC surgeon who accompanies her doting and domineering mother to dances at the local Chinese-American social club.  The mother, Hwei-Lan Gao, is herself the dutiful daughter of recent immigrants.  A widow, she scours the dances in hopes of finding Mr. Right for both herself and her single daughter.  Unbeknownst to her, Wil is secretly scouting for Ms. Right while enduring the unwanted attentions of oafish stockbrokers.  Then, Viv (Lynn Chen) steps into the picture.  Like Wil, Viv comes from a lopsided family.  Her intense father has pushed her into the cutthroat ballet world.  To complicate matters further, Viv`s father is Wil`s boss at the hospital.Unlike Wil, Viv is assertive and open, knowing exactly what she wants.  And she wants Wil.  And Wil wants Viv but doesn`t have the courage to pursue it.  Instead, Viv gets her girl and the film travels through the courtship and consummation of their budding relationship.  The film explores their relationship in a lighthearted, coy manner as both girls soon learn that their mutual attraction to one another might hold something more. While the hyper professional Wil is content to covertly share Viv`s bed and body, Viv wants Wil to acknowledge their love to the outside world. Yet, Wil has other problems at hand.  Her mom has decided to move in with her, pregnant and without a husband.The scenes of mother/daughter adjustment are witty and spot-on.  Joan Chen plays the immigrant mom perfectly, showing a woman enduring a true mid-life crisis suspended between two very different cultures.  Spending her days watching Chinese soaps on TV, she turns Wil`s apartment and life upside down.  Moreover, her old country superstitions (too much soy sauce will change your skin color!) make for some unexpected humor.  Wil suffers her mother`s idiosyncrasies while trying to find her a suitable husband.  Hwei`s `dates` are a hilarious and realistic slice of middle-aged bachelor buffoonery.  Meanwhile, Viv gives Wil her ultimatum: come forward with their relationship or goodbye.  Wil`s `coming out` to her mom is portrayed with an awkward vulnerability that is both moving and realistic.While the ending is a bit sugary and fake, it nevertheless works for this light comedy of manners and mores.  `Saving Face` has neither the mournful gravity of `Brokeback Mountain,` nor the flaccid silliness of many same-sex relationship dramas.  Instead, its strength lies with its quiet attachment to the way things really are.  When faced with the truth, both Wil and her mom do what most of us do: take the easy way out.  Acceptance is shown here as the gradual, often painful process it usually is.  Unlike most romantic `dramedies, ` `Saving Face` shines a light on those relationships we are too afraid to show the world.  In addition, its presentation of generational friction within an immigrant community is truly original.  Last but not least, the on-screen chemistry between the three very talented and fetching leads is something to behold.  Joan Chen has never been better.  Although not without its flaws, `Saving Grace` is definitely a winner worthy of repeat viewings.",4,Charming dramedy!,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,3730,"['romantic', 'comedy', 'complex', 'mother/daughter', 'issues', 'core', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'then', 'take', 'chance', 'Alice', 'Wu', 's', 'debut', 'effort', 'Saving', 'Face.', 'charming', 'funny', 'tale', 'Saving', 'Face', 'really', 'two', 'stories', 'welded', 'one', 'central', 'plot', 'revolves', 'blossoming', 'romance', 'two', 'successful', 'Chinese-Americans', 'smartly', 'played', 'attractive', 'newcomers', 'Michelle', 'Krusiec', 'Lynn', 'Chen', 'one', 'girl', 's', 'mothers', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'grand', 'performance', 'middle-aged', 'immigrant', 'woman', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'secret', 'dilemma.Wilhelmina', 'Krusiec', 'driven', 'NYC', 'surgeon', 'who', 'doting', 'domineering', 'mother', 'dances', 'local', 'Chinese-American', 'social', 'club', 'mother', 'Hwei-Lan', 'Gao', 'dutiful', 'daughter', 'recent', 'immigrants', 'widow', 'scours', 'dances', 'hopes', 'finding', 'Mr', 'Right', 'single', 'daughter', 'Unbeknownst', 'Wil', 'secretly', 'scouting', 'Ms', 'Right', 'enduring', 'unwanted', 'attentions', 'oafish', 'stockbrokers', 'Then', 'Viv', 'Lynn', 'Chen', 'picture', 'Wil', 'Viv', 'lopsided', 'family', 'intense', 'father', 'pushed', 'cutthroat', 'ballet', 'world', 'complicate', 'matters', 'further', 'Viv', 's', 'father', 'Wil', 's', 'boss', 'hospital.Unlike', 'Wil', 'Viv', 'assertive', 'open', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'what', 'Wil', 'Wil', 'Viv', 'doesn', 't', 'have', 'courage', 'pursue', 'Instead', 'Viv', 'girl', 'film', 'travels', 'courtship', 'consummation', 'budding', 'relationship', 'film', 'relationship', 'lighthearted', 'coy', 'manner', 'girls', 'soon', 'learn', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'one', 'might', 'hold', 'something', 'more', 'hyper', 'professional', 'Wil', 'content', 'covertly', 'share', 'Viv', 's', 'bed', 'body', 'Viv', 'Wil', 'acknowledge', 'love', 'outside', 'world', 'Wil', 'other', 'problems', 'hand', 'mom', 'decided', 'move', 'pregnant', 'husband.The', 'scenes', 'mother/daughter', 'adjustment', 'are', 'witty', 'spot-on', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'immigrant', 'mom', 'perfectly', 'showing', 'woman', 'enduring', 'true', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'suspended', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'cultures', 'Spending', 'days', 'watching', 'Chinese', 'soaps', 'TV', 'Wil', 's', 'apartment', 'life', 'upside', 'down', 'Moreover', 'old', 'country', 'superstitions', 'too', 'much', 'soy', 'sauce', 'will', 'change', 'skin', 'color', 'make', 'unexpected', 'humor', 'Wil', 'suffers', 'mother', 's', 'idiosyncrasies', 'trying', 'find', 'suitable', 'husband', 'Hwei', 's', 'dates', 'are', 'hilarious', 'realistic', 'slice', 'middle-aged', 'bachelor', 'buffoonery', 'Meanwhile', 'Viv', 'Wil', 'ultimatum', 'come', 'forward', 'relationship', 'goodbye', 'Wil', 's', 'coming', 'out', 'mom', 'portrayed', 'awkward', 'vulnerability', 'moving', 'realistic.While', 'ending', 'bit', 'sugary', 'fake', 'nevertheless', 'light', 'comedy', 'manners', 'mores', 'Saving', 'Face', 'mournful', 'gravity', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'flaccid', 'silliness', 'many', 'same-sex', 'relationship', 'dramas', 'Instead', 'strength', 'quiet', 'attachment', 'way', 'things', 'really', 'are', 'When', 'faced', 'truth', 'Wil', 'mom', 'do', 'what', 'most', 'do', 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'Acceptance', 'shown', 'here', 'gradual', 'often', 'painful', 'process', 'usually', 'most', 'romantic', 'dramedies', 'Saving', 'Face', 'shines', 'light', 'relationships', 'are', 'too', 'afraid', 'show', 'world', 'addition', 'presentation', 'generational', 'friction', 'immigrant', 'community', 'truly', 'original', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'three', 'very', 'talented', 'fetching', 'leads', 'something', 'behold', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'not', 'flaws', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'definitely', 'winner', 'worthy', 'repeat', 'viewings']",N/A

Wu also looks at the challages that face both the old and new generation, how can they communicate and learn from each other when life is changing so quickly for both.The actresses in this movie are fantastic. Krusies is both smart and charming, but the real beauty is Joan Chen who just lights up the screen with her presence.

A poignant tale of cultural clashes versus the fulfilment of traditional Chinese expectations, the film talks about a middle age widow who becomes unexpectedly pregnant much to the chagrin of her professor father who worries about losing face. Meanwhile, her grown-up surgeon daughter is battling coming public with her lesbianism as well as mending the broken fence when she admits to her mother of her socially stigmatised inclinations.Interweaved in between are plenty of East-meets-West humour and impeccably fine acting coming from the stellar cast, most notably Joan Chen's role as the widow whose funny and unnerving ways also show a vulnerable and lonesome side when torn between conforming to her authoritarian father's ways once again and finding the freedom that she's in dire need of. Chen gives her best as both a subserviant daughter and a straight-faced mother. Daughter Wil played by Michelle Krusiec and her lesbian lover played by Lynn Chen also lend great support to the film which is ultimately bittersweet.

931455,ADKHI1TUGAX4,B000AQOHN0,E. Anderson,"[2, 2]","I have to be the first to admit that I don't like romantic comedies. I find them saccherine sweet with unrealistic ideals on true love. But last year, I stumbled upon a little independent film called ""Saving Face"" which showed me that not all romantic comedies are unrealistic and will give me cavities.The film stars Michelle Krusiec as Wil, a young, talented surgeon and Joan Chen as her mother Ma. Just as Wil begins to start dating a gorgeous ballerina named Vivian (the stunning Lynn Chen), Wil's world comes crashing when she is forced to let her mom move in because she is pregnant and won't name the father. Lots of laughs ensues when Ma's old world ways and Wil's modern ways collide. In an ironic twist of fate both women keeps their pregnancy and love life a secret.The primary focus of ""Saving Face"" is on the relationship between Ma and Wil. In fact, this film is a love letter to the director Alice Wu's mother. I like the fact that the relationships that both women are involved in are not traditional and are portrayed in a honest, truthful manner. I found the writing smart and hilarious especially during the scene between Ma, Wil, and Wil's neighbor Jay.Granted the ending of the film is a bit questionable as far as realism is concerned but I still found it humorous. I especially like the scenes during the closing credits. I also loved Ma's so-called friends who had nothing better to do than gossip. Alice Wu did a great job in both writing, directing, and casting. I can only hope that her future films will be as entertaing as ""Saving Face"" was and still is to me.",5,My favorite film of 2005,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,1589,"['have', 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'find', 'saccherine', 'sweet', 'unrealistic', 'ideals', 'true', 'love', 'last', 'year', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'little', 'independent', 'film', 'called', 'Saving', 'Face', 'showed', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'unrealistic', 'will', 'give', 'cavities.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Michelle', 'Krusiec', 'Wil', 'young', 'talented', 'surgeon', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'mother', 'Ma', 'Just', 'Wil', 'start', 'dating', 'gorgeous', 'ballerina', 'named', 'Vivian', 'stunning', 'Lynn', 'Chen', 'Wil', 'world', 'crashing', 'when', 'forced', 'let', 'mom', 'move', 'pregnant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'name', 'father', 'Lots', 'laughs', 'ensues', 'when', 'Ma', 'old', 'world', 'ways', 'Wil', 'modern', 'ways', 'collide', 'ironic', 'twist', 'fate', 'women', 'keeps', 'pregnancy', 'love', 'life', 'secret.The', 'primary', 'focus', 'Saving', 'Face', 'relationship', 'Ma', 'Wil', 'fact', 'film', 'love', 'letter', 'director', 'Alice', 'Wu', 'mother', 'fact', 'relationships', 'women', 'are', 'involved', 'are', 'not', 'traditional', 'are', 'portrayed', 'honest', 'truthful', 'manner', 'found', 'writing', 'smart', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'scene', 'Ma', 'Wil', 'Wil', 'neighbor', 'Jay.Granted', 'ending', 'film', 'bit', 'questionable', 'as', 'far', 'realism', 'concerned', 'still', 'found', 'humorous', 'especially', 'scenes', 'closing', 'credits', 'also', 'loved', 'Ma', 'so-called', 'friends', 'who', 'had', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'gossip', 'Alice', 'Wu', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'writing', 'directing', 'casting', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'future', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'entertaing', 'Saving', 'Face', 'was', 'still']",N/A
931456,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000AQOHN0,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 7]","First-time feature director/screenwriter Alice Wu's 2005 indie comedy has familiar movie themes running all through it, but it is still an unexpected charmer with its laconic storytelling, unforced humor and a trio of winning performances. With a conflicted protagonist at its core, the film shares the same souffl&eacute;-light rom-com territory as Ol Parker's half-hearted ""Imagine Me and You"" and Ian Iqbal Rashid's overly cute ""A Touch of Pink"". Wu, however, manages to bring a less derivative style to her venture due to the unique cultural subtext and more importantly, because her script unspools the fates of the main characters in meticulous vignettes.The plot focuses on Wil, short for Wilhelmina, an obviously talented Manhattan-based surgical resident who has kept herself closeted from her traditional Chinese family living across the East River in Flushing. Referred to just as ""Ma"" in the story, her mother is a widowed beautician, who only speaks Mandarin to her daughter and keeps flinging potential suitors at her. Wil's eyes, nevertheless, are set squarely on a comely ballerina named Vivian, who happens to be the daughter of Wil's supervising surgeon at the hospital. Meantime, Ma is in her own pickle as she finds herself pregnant and subsequently ejected from the family home. Ma moves in with Wil, and the inevitable consequences ensue. There are affecting moments of lightness and gravitas throughout, but much of the charm of the film comes naturally from the three leads.As Wil, Michelle Krusiec is a terrific find, evoking the simmering turmoil of her situation in unexpected ways even when the script fails her at times. Lynn Chen is saucy and inviting as Vivian, though I wish we could have seen one scene where she dances onstage since such a strong point is made on what style she wants to pursue. Both actresses make the attraction between the characters palpable, culminating in the inevitable girl-on-girl scene. Despite the beauty of her younger co-stars, Joan Chen is almost too gorgeous to be playing such an emotionally constrained character. Even though her character is supposed to be closing in on fifty, Chen is just 43 and frankly looks ensconced in her thirties, making her the rare case of looking far younger at the end of the movie than at the beginning. Yet, she is able to convey the necessary brittle, distanced manner as Ma, making her character's self-discovery process more rewarding.The ending is on the pat side, especially a silly multiple confessional at a wedding and a wedged-in riff on ""The Graduate"", but it doesn't compromise the sweet-natured charm of the piece. Special mention should go to Harlan Bosmajian's cinematography, which captures the saturated colors found in the Chinese-American community. The 2005 DVD contains Wu's thoughtful commentary on a separate track, as well as several deleted scenes, a standard, ten-minute making-of featurette and a rather dull Sundance video diary.",4,A Cunning Coming-Out Charmer With a Trio of Winning Female Performances,1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,2956,"['First-time', 'feature', 'director/screenwriter', 'Alice', 'Wu', '2005', 'indie', 'comedy', 'familiar', 'movie', 'themes', 'running', 'still', 'unexpected', 'charmer', 'laconic', 'storytelling', 'unforced', 'humor', 'trio', 'winning', 'performances', 'conflicted', 'protagonist', 'core', 'film', 'shares', 'same', 'souffl', 'eacute', 'rom-com', 'territory', 'Ol', 'Parker', 'half-hearted', 'Imagine', 'Me', 'Ian', 'Iqbal', 'Rashid', 'overly', 'cute', 'A', 'Touch', 'Pink', 'Wu', 'however', 'bring', 'less', 'derivative', 'style', 'venture', 'due', 'unique', 'cultural', 'subtext', 'more', 'importantly', 'script', 'fates', 'main', 'characters', 'meticulous', 'vignettes.The', 'plot', 'Wil', 'short', 'Wilhelmina', 'obviously', 'talented', 'Manhattan-based', 'surgical', 'resident', 'who', 'kept', 'closeted', 'traditional', 'Chinese', 'family', 'living', 'East', 'River', 'Flushing', 'Referred', 'just', 'Ma', 'story', 'mother', 'widowed', 'beautician', 'who', 'only', 'Mandarin', 'daughter', 'flinging', 'potential', 'suitors', 'Wil', 'eyes', 'nevertheless', 'are', 'set', 'squarely', 'comely', 'ballerina', 'named', 'Vivian', 'who', 'be', 'daughter', 'Wil', 'supervising', 'surgeon', 'hospital', 'Meantime', 'Ma', 'own', 'pickle', 'pregnant', 'subsequently', 'ejected', 'family', 'home', 'Ma', 'Wil', 'inevitable', 'consequences', 'ensue', 'are', 'affecting', 'moments', 'lightness', 'gravitas', 'much', 'charm', 'film', 'naturally', 'three', 'leads.As', 'Wil', 'Michelle', 'Krusiec', 'terrific', 'find', 'evoking', 'simmering', 'turmoil', 'situation', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'even', 'when', 'script', 'times', 'Lynn', 'Chen', 'saucy', 'inviting', 'Vivian', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'onstage', 'strong', 'point', 'made', 'what', 'style', 'pursue', 'actresses', 'make', 'attraction', 'characters', 'palpable', 'culminating', 'inevitable', 'girl-on-girl', 'scene', 'beauty', 'younger', 'co-stars', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'almost', 'too', 'gorgeous', 'be', 'playing', 'such', 'emotionally', 'constrained', 'character', 'Even', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'closing', 'fifty', 'Chen', 'just', '43', 'frankly', 'ensconced', 'thirties', 'making', 'rare', 'case', 'looking', 'far', 'younger', 'end', 'movie', 'beginning', 'able', 'convey', 'necessary', 'brittle', 'distanced', 'manner', 'Ma', 'making', 'character', 'self-discovery', 'process', 'more', 'rewarding.The', 'ending', 'pat', 'side', 'especially', 'silly', 'multiple', 'confessional', 'wedding', 'wedged-in', 'riff', 'Graduate', ""n't"", 'compromise', 'sweet-natured', 'charm', 'piece', 'Special', 'mention', 'should', 'go', 'Harlan', 'Bosmajian', 'cinematography', 'saturated', 'colors', 'found', 'Chinese-American', 'community', '2005', 'DVD', 'Wu', 'thoughtful', 'commentary', 'separate', 'track', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'standard', 'ten-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'rather', 'dull', 'Sundance', 'video', 'diary']",N/A

To begin with, Alice Wu's SAVING FACE is bilingual, half in Chinese [easy to read subtitles] mixed with English. The movie tries to bridge the divide among three generations of Chinese-Americans living in New York City, and three women struggling with their cultural and sexual identities.The obvious plot is that Wilhelmina's (Michelle Krusiec) mother (Joan Chen), a 48 year old widow has become pregnant which disgraces her professor father -- and bewilders her daughter  ""Wil.""  Meanwhile, Wil is a brilliant young surgeon who is being set up for marriage in the tight knit Chinese community with an assortment of eligible bachelors at ""compulsory"" community dances. But Wil never has time to even begin dating a pre-selected husband. She hasn't even had time for coming to terms with her own sexuality. Conveniently, she can always hide behind her busy medical career.Enter the gorgeous and sensual Vivian (Lynn Chen) -- who is not only a meteorically rising ballerina-cum-modern dancer, but her father is chief of surgery and Wil's supervisor. The two young women have a brief encounter at a ""compulsory"" community dance, and Vivian is smitten by the hapless Wil. Throughout the film, everyone is hiding something -- Wil's mother hides the identity of her unborn baby's improbable father (who, as it later turns out, loves her deeply adnb she loves him). Will hides her inevitble sexual liasons with Vivian. Vivian is the only one who dares coming to terms with her love for Mil. But her dancing career is beginning to take off and if Wil cannot soon dare to expose the reality of their relationship then Vivcian will have  to sadly move on without her.Most of film is about the seeming impossibility of the three women to solve the problems of their forbidden relationships. This is the result of the intense pressures put on them by a constantly intervening, conservatively traditonal Chinese community.Rather than seeing this as the clich? of a ""lesbian film"" -- I'd rather relax with the timeless human problem (like the star crossed lovers Romeo and Juilliet) in this film about women falling into deeply passionate, albeit forbidden love. Director (screen writer) Wu brilliantly takes us through the angst felt by each of the women -- and keeps us guessing as to whether or not they will be able to resolve their problems so that they may live happily ever after with the person who they love.So I look upon this delightful movie not as a ""lesbian film"" but rather as a movie about three women who must try to consumate their love which is forbidden by their community. Two of the women happen to be in love with one another; that is, they're lesbians.Great film.

931461,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000AQOHN0,Grady Harp,"[9, 10]","Alice Wu has written and directed this absolutely charming little story about love in various permutations with such grace and delicacy that it transcends the various genre categories into which it could fall (lesbian movie, Chinese cultural stringencies on contemporary life, December/May affairs) and becomes a movie for all audiences.  From the opening credits through to the end credits she frames her simple/complex stories with light humor, grace, and warmth.  Originally a designer of computer software for Microsoft, Wu changed her career after winning a prize for her screenplay 'Saving Face' which is based on her own coming out story as a gay woman. This is her first film! She is a talent to watch!Wilhemina (Michelle Krusiec) is a lesbian surgical resident in New York City whose widow mother Ma (Joan Chen) appears at her door, pregnant at age 48 by a man whose name she will not disclose.  Ma's parents (Wil's grandparents) disown Ma for staining their proud cultural standing in the community of Flushing, NY.  Ma redecorates Wil's drab apartment and proceeds to play matchmaker to find Wil a husband.  Wil meets Vivian (Lynn Chen), a ballet dancer struggling with approaching fame in classical ballet while longing for a more expressive role in modern dance, and they fall into a fine romance.  Wil turns the tables on Ma as a matchmaker, seeing that the only way to gain her freedom is for Ma to marry a man who will support her and raise her illegitimate child - and free Wil to embrace her own life.Stressors abound: Vivian is offered a prime job with the Paris Opera Ballet which would necessitate her move away from Wil; Grandma dies making Ma and Wil more supportive of Grandpa; Wil 'comes out' to her homophobic Ma; Vivian's father (who happens to be Wil's boss at the hospital) pleas with Wil to support Vivian's career move to Paris.  In an attempt to settle all matters Ma consents to marry a good man but one whom she doesn't love.  At the thirteenth hour Wil disrupts the wedding, pleading with her Ma to be with the man she love - the surprise father of her unborn child - and all things begin to fall in place.The cast is homogenously fine and Joan Chen is exceptional!  She is a fine, subtle actress who prevents Ma from falling into any number of stereotypes and instead produces a challenged woman we all want to love.  But in the end the kudos go to Alice Wu for the strength of her screenplay and her masterful direction of her fine cast.  This is not a GREAT movie cinematically speaking, but it is a warm, entertaining, honest, touching film that certainly deserves a lot of attention.

931466,A272FTK28Q2IHR,B000AQOHN0,"Julien Kujo ""pinecloud""","[3, 4]","I saw a remarkable humanistic illumination into women's right to love and of course am grateful not to witness  violence and intimidation against the female couple.  In fact this is a film exceptionally well written and carefully directed to bring illumination to women's right to love - Recommend anyone above 16 years old to increase awareness of modern worldLove between women is simply so pure and graceful, and it may not always be appropriate nor impartial to call them lesbians as the Occidental cultures have been labelling them.  Man's love may include a portfolio of materialistic prosperity but there always be some area left out such as basis for a perfect equality which is essential for their sense of mutual belonging and a higher sense of harmony ultimately leading to spiritual unity that women vow to each other.  I personally can not deny venerance of any mentioned qualitiesthat we men can not compete that of women.  It is invalid to deny that they have innate ability to embellish one another with sublime grace. I would certainly encourage if your own daughter fell in love with another woman,  why can't you accept that woman as a member of extended family?  Reward and contribution to the humanity is immense!Cruelty against women is cruelty against mankind itself! We all need woman for their purity of love and depth of compassion. Throughout civilisation, women have never been valued equal as men . . . . But why?  In some culture, they even have discarded new born female infants as trash or even traded for money or abandoned in favour of male infants. What a shame! Females are more pleasing to look at because their love and compassion are finer and deeper . . . bringing a priceless enlightenment through their innate sensitivity to our lives.  Pope Clementius V enacted ecclesiastical law citing that females were inferior subjects not suitable to appear in any place of human assembly such as Theatres and Schools nor to voice their opinions. Except Japan and Sweden, Female homosexuals were almost always executed, imprisoned, institutionalised, slayed, raped and burnt alive whereas male counterparts had survived.I have always wondered why the majority of films about woman's love had to end in tragedy unless there is a motivation to depict and criticise the cruelty of political agenda of the nation in effect during a period where scenario was written to criticise a dictator such as Chairman Mao, or worse yet when director is affiliated with the conservative financiers or with a political party where he or she belonged to, to supplant the idea on audience that it is wrong for any woman to love another woman hence the punishment is inevitable.  When such scheme is in effect, how true and natural women's right to love can be accomplished free from delusion or deception?Chinese films from main land have always showed us the singled out attack only against women's rights throughout Chinese history, and how these women were ill-reputed in China. I view such favouritism practiced for also constitute a serious crime against humanity in contrast to  men's rights (including same-sex relationship practiced between ancient emperors and his knights or lord chamberlains or lord regents)  and its outcome as early as 1600 B.C. during Liu dynasty, Wei dynasty and Han dynasty are all well documented They even have had  the most bizarre custom procuring catamite (pederastic relationship) for sovereign prince. The economic impact resulting from the emperor willing to compromise the estate and wealth to sustain such extravagant relationship could be so large that could not be compared with any minimal impact that the relationship between women can likely to had caused to the community has always remained negligibly modest if not been none. What about for women's rights?  Shamefully poor in comparison with other neighbouring nations in Far East, with Japan in particular? I grew up in Kyoto, Japan. Contrarily to common belief, before the paternalistic authoritarianism ever had any chance to come in effect in Japan, there were  four contiguous centuries, a long historic period called the He An Era (794 - 1185 A.D. meaning the time for peace and tranquillity) where contemporary feminist scholars including art, poetry, and literature flourished in Japanese Imperial Court. It is often considered the peak of the Japanese culture particularly in women scholars. I have actually seen a 900 years old priceless byobu (silk panel folding screen) with two young lovely court ladies in waiting (resembling Li Ming except wearing summer Kimono attires) holding their hands on Great Gojo Bridge watching fireworks together on a mid-summer evening. I have always been a straight male but I could not help but so impressed by its poetry like beauty. There exist a court diary written by a high ranking court lady in waiting of noble birth referencing her adoration on sovereign princess whom she served  with explicit words like ""moist lips"", 'full figure"", ""beautiful breasts"", ""silky skin"", ""perfect complexion"" time after times in her diary. Li Ming and Chen An would have had an affluent life with perfect respectable positions in the Court. Traditionally those positions were monopolised by the daughters of Fujiwara, Taira, Konoye or Kujo Families.  Let's just pray so that at least one of sovereign princesses would make a merciful exception for them to work together at her palace.  Women were allowed to sleep in the same bedroom, to bath together and to enjoy themselves much more openly in Japan before the dark age. The pathetic repression caused upon young adults by The Chinese Cultural Revolution was devastating and totally absurd in the context of humanity. Sadly in term of humanity, 1980's China was 900 years behind from it's neighbouring country Japan in term of woman's rights.Since the beginning of civilisation, philosophers, psychologists, many scholars and like had debated against the superiority of love that a woman can offer to all of man kinds (to both men and to women). I strongly believe that of women are definitely superior to the others. Since the majority of us do not experience temporary loss of vision or complete loss of consciousness due to deep sedation for major surgery such as open heart or open skull procedures. Using artificial Heart and Lung machine, often the heart is removed outside the sternum whilst surgeon can work on.  Such a  procedures can cause tremendous trauma to your psyche.  It is not unusual for patient and nurse to develop an almost like loving attachment to each other from the moment the nurse transfers you from a rolling bed to a recovery bed, then calling your name and caressing you as if rescuing you from desolated realm of unconscious.  If you had compared it with the same task performed by male surgical assistants at operating room , you will become quite  impressed with the fact that a woman's love is a priceless enlightenment. The tenderness of woman's expression of love is inexplicable beyond any words. It is highly likely that someone like Wil already had intuitively known the enlightenment that only a woman can bring to her soul.Every female child has dreams of being swept up into a great adventure, of being the beautiful princess. Lamentably, when women grow up, they are often swept up into a life filled merely with demands, duty and responsibility. Many women are tired, struggling under the merciless pressure to be of a faithful servant, or a caregiver for children, husband or authoritarian father and like.  I have known an award winning blind female writer  back in Japan and her nurse companion who helped her publishing her novels until the end of writer's life at age 72. The nurse companion  died next summer found afloat on River Kamo during Gion Festival (Buddhist's  Ancester Revisiting season) leaving a will to be buried next to the writer. In fact I have seen them twice together on the stone bridge across a pond within the property of an ancient 10th century Buddhist temple in 1970's. Nurse were eyes to the writer and describing everything that the nurse can see. The both women looked very beautiful radiating the glory of love between them. They both were descendant of ancient noble families go back to 11th century and their presence seemed to enhance the tranquillity of the mid-autumn setting.  I could not help but wishing their happy union forever from the moment I saw the strength and intensity of woman's love.Pinecloud,  a straight male, Palo Alto, California, USA",5,I saw a remarkable

931467,A25JH6CO4DVINS,B000AQOHN0,Junglies,"[52, 56]","This is a rather cute romantic comedy set in the Chinese community in one section of New York about a widowed mother who discovers that she is pregnant and who prefers not to disclose who the father of the unborn child is.To complicate matters, her daughter is a successful doctor who has great potential in her chosen profession who does not have the time or apparent inclination to seek out a mate for herself.The choice of New York as the backdrop for this tale is symbolic in the city's role as a gateway to the new world. The tale itself is replete with contrasts of new versus old culture, old family forms and authority structures versus the new, old versus new cultures etc. In one scene mother and daughter are having two conversations with|not with each other: the mother addresses her daughter in Chinese, the daughter addresses her mother in English.As the movie proceeds the viewer is drawn into the tale almost imperceptibly so much so that one begins to empathise with each of the characters rather than take sides. Joan Chen is in superb form as the restrained mother, keeping her secret but managing all the while to maintain face for the family name. Her cautious daughter, torn as it were, between old and new, is often uncertain about the direction in which to go but which ultimately achieves resolution in the final scene.This is a story of love and life cutting across conventional and cultural boundaries. The tale is told in a gentle and charming way, lending poise to the proceedings and allowing for the possibility for change to be affected by the rather revolutionary actions of an individual and for gradual but significant cultural changes to occur which are, in their own way rather monumental.The movie kept my attention throughout and although there are a number of minor issues which drew my attention I did not find them sufficently distracting to disturb my enjoying. Although lightweight in a way it is a pleasant experience which throws some light on a number of important social issues. Although my 11 year old son was disinclined towatch my fifteen year old daughter enjoyed the movie and was comfortable with the issues exposed.Good stuff.",4,I've looked at life from both sides now,1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,2181,"['rather', 'cute', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'set', 'Chinese', 'community', 'one', 'section', 'New', 'York', 'widowed', 'mother', 'who', 'pregnant', 'who', 'not', 'disclose', 'who', 'father', 'unborn', 'child', 'is.To', 'complicate', 'matters', 'daughter', 'successful', 'doctor', 'who', 'great', 'potential', 'chosen', 'profession', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'apparent', 'inclination', 'seek', 'out', 'mate', 'herself.The', 'choice', 'New', 'York', 'backdrop', 'tale', 'symbolic', 'city', 'role', 'gateway', 'new', 'world', 'tale', 'replete', 'contrasts', 'new', 'versus', 'old', 'culture', 'old', 'family', 'forms', 'authority', 'structures', 'versus', 'new', 'old', 'versus', 'new', 'cultures', 'etc', 'one', 'scene', 'mother', 'daughter', 'are', 'having', 'two', 'conversations', 'with|not', 'other', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Chinese', 'daughter', 'mother', 'English.As', 'movie', 'viewer', 'drawn', 'tale', 'almost', 'imperceptibly', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'empathise', 'characters', 'rather', 'take', 'sides', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'superb', 'form', 'restrained', 'mother', 'keeping', 'secret', 'managing', 'while', 'maintain', 'face', 'family', 'name', 'cautious', 'daughter', 'torn', 'were', 'old', 'new', 'often', 'uncertain', 'direction', 'go', 'ultimately', 'resolution', 'final', 'scene.This', 'story', 'love', 'life', 'cutting', 'conventional', 'cultural', 'boundaries', 'tale', 'told', 'gentle', 'charming', 'way', 'lending', 'poise', 'proceedings', 'allowing', 'possibility', 'change', 'be', 'affected', 'rather', 'revolutionary', 'actions', 'individual', 'gradual', 'significant', 'cultural', 'changes', 'occur', 'are', 'own', 'way', 'rather', 'monumental.The', 'movie', 'kept', 'attention', 'are', 'number', 'minor', 'issues', 'drew', 'attention', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'sufficently', 'distracting', 'disturb', 'enjoying', 'lightweight', 'way', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'light', 'number', 'important', 'social', 'issues', '11', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'was', 'disinclined', 'towatch', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'comfortable', 'issues', 'exposed.Good', 'stuff']",N/A

It slipped my mind what this film was really about but after the first fifteen minutes you see how the two girls look at each other and it becomes loud and clear. If you ask me Saving Face isn't really a love story but more like a story showing that even if it's a girl dating a girl relationships are all the same. That's clear when Vivian (Lynn Chin) gets mad at Wil because her hectic life of being a surgeon leaves her no time to spend with her new love. The love wasn't strong enough to pull you in but the comedy definitely is. You also have the mystery of who is the man that Wil's (Michelle Krusiec) Mom is secretly seeing and got her pregnant. Although Saving Face can get a little long at times it's still worth a watch.

The script by first time director Alice Wu is very well written. The romantic relationship between Wil and Vivian was the highlight of the movie for me. Lynn Chen who plays Vivian is very feminine, beautiful and sexy. My favorite character is Wil, played by Michelle Krusiec. I could relate to how her character was hesitant to express her sensuality and affection with another woman in public.I also enjoyed the character Ma, played by Joan Chen. As a non Mandarin speaker, the subtitles were easy to read and not much of a distraction. I am very interested in Chinese culture and I am very pleased a very good movie, such as ""Saving Face,"" primarily featuring Chinese - American actresses and actors has been produced.

931471,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000AQOHN0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[17, 17]","It was not until I watched the special features on the ""Saving Face"" DVD that I realized the reason it was in my rental queue was that I had gone in and added a whole bunch of movies from this year's Sundance Film Festival.  So I started watching this 2005 film knowing nothing more than Joan Chen played the mother of a dutiful daughter and expecting something more along the lines of ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" than ""Kissing Jessica Stein.""  There is something to be said for watching a movie in blissful ignorance in a world where all too often the best bits are already crammed into the film's trailer, and watching first time writer-director Alice Wu's romantic comedy without any idea of what it was really about was a delightful surprise.Wil (Michelle Krusied) is a talented young surgeon who seems to be too busy with her work to find a husband, while her Ma (Chen) works in a department store.  Pointedly both jobs require women to save the faces of others, but the title of the film really comes into play when Ma moves in with Wil because the 48-year-old widow is pregnant and has been kicked out of the house of her father (Jin Wang).  Ma refuses to say who the father is and until she has a husband the shame is too great for the family (read: for grandfather) to bear.  So now Wil and Ma are living together and talking about soy sauce rather than about anything important like the baby.Then mother and daughter have awakenings of their hearts.  For Wil it is meeting Vivian (Lynn Chen), a ballet dancer who she keeps running into at the hospital.  There is instant chemistry between the two, but Wil is reticent about anything even approaching public displays of affection.  Meanwhile, Ma discovers there are more Chinese movies at the local video store than ""The Last Emperor"" and ""The Joy Luck Club,"" and is soon hooked on Chinese soap operas.  As Wil pushes her mother to actually go out on dates for the first time in her life, she makes an emotional commitment to Vivian.  But both mother and daughter seem equally incapable of letting themselves find true happiness.  Then fate finds ways of pushing both of them over the edge.""Saving Face"" is filled with lots of character driven humor, which makes sense given all the colorful characters Wu has created to tell her tale.  One of the strengths of the story is that even though these characters are all so Chinese (it is normal for Ma to speak in Mandarin while Wil's half of the conversation is mostly in English), there is still something universal about the people and the situations.  Most viewers will not be surprised that Joan Chen is still a beautiful woman, especially in some of the dresses she wears in the later part of the film, but will be surprised that she is such a comedian as Ma.  Wu evidences a deft touch for using camera shots and cutting in the editing room to make the humor work.  Another strength is that Wil's relationship with Ma is as crucial as the one with Vivian.  The movie is rated R for some sexuality and language, which is interesting because it also includes a nude scene, albeit one that is cute and endearing (with a funny payoff), because Wil and Vivian make such a sweet couple.The DVD extras include Wu and the cast taking their film to Sundance and a standard behind the scenes featurette.  What is missing is an actual trailer for ""Saving Face""; I assume there is one out there I would like to see it now that I have caught the film.  Wu does not talk as much as you would like during the commentary track, but you will get a much fuller appreciation of the calculated way music is used in the film and learn that the scene that reminds you of ""The Graduate"" is supposed to remind you of ""The Graduate.""  ""Saving Face"" is one of those films that you like even better the second time you watch it because you have a better understanding of how well it is constructed and will be even more impressed with Wu as both a first time director and first time screenwriter.",5,First time filmmaker Alice Wu comes up with a loving romantic comedy,1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,3975,"['was', 'not', 'watched', 'special', 'features', 'Saving', 'Face', 'DVD', 'realized', 'reason', 'was', 'rental', 'queue', 'was', 'had', 'gone', 'added', 'whole', 'bunch', 'movies', 'year', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'So', 'started', 'watching', '2005', 'film', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'more', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'played', 'mother', 'dutiful', 'daughter', 'expecting', 'something', 'more', 'lines', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'watching', 'movie', 'blissful', 'ignorance', 'world', 'where', 'too', 'often', 'best', 'bits', 'are', 'already', 'crammed', 'film', 'trailer', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'writer-director', 'Alice', 'Wu', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'about', 'was', 'delightful', 'surprise.Wil', 'Michelle', 'Krusied', 'talented', 'young', 'surgeon', 'who', 'be', 'too', 'busy', 'work', 'find', 'husband', 'Ma', 'Chen', 'department', 'store', 'Pointedly', 'jobs', 'require', 'women', 'save', 'others', 'title', 'film', 'really', 'play', 'when', 'Ma', 'Wil', '48-year-old', 'widow', 'pregnant', 'been', 'kicked', 'house', 'father', 'Jin', 'Wang', 'Ma', 'say', 'who', 'father', 'husband', 'shame', 'too', 'great', 'family', 'read', 'grandfather', 'bear', 'So', 'now', 'Wil', 'Ma', 'are', 'living', 'together', 'talking', 'soy', 'sauce', 'rather', 'anything', 'important', 'baby.Then', 'mother', 'daughter', 'have', 'awakenings', 'hearts', 'Wil', 'meeting', 'Vivian', 'Lynn', 'Chen', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'who', 'running', 'hospital', 'instant', 'chemistry', 'two', 'Wil', 'reticent', 'anything', 'even', 'approaching', 'public', 'displays', 'affection', 'Meanwhile', 'Ma', 'are', 'more', 'Chinese', 'movies', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'soon', 'hooked', 'Chinese', 'soap', 'operas', 'Wil', 'mother', 'actually', 'go', 'out', 'dates', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'emotional', 'commitment', 'Vivian', 'mother', 'daughter', 'seem', 'equally', 'incapable', 'letting', 'find', 'true', 'happiness', 'Then', 'fate', 'finds', 'ways', 'pushing', 'edge', 'Saving', 'Face', 'filled', 'lots', 'character', 'driven', 'humor', 'sense', 'given', 'colorful', 'characters', 'Wu', 'created', 'tell', 'tale', 'One', 'strengths', 'story', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'Chinese', 'normal', 'Ma', 'speak', 'Mandarin', 'Wil', 'half', 'conversation', 'mostly', 'English', 'still', 'something', 'universal', 'people', 'situations', 'Most', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'still', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'especially', 'dresses', 'later', 'part', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'such', 'comedian', 'Ma', 'Wu', 'deft', 'touch', 'using', 'camera', 'shots', 'cutting', 'editing', 'room', 'make', 'humor', 'work', 'strength', 'Wil', 'relationship', 'Ma', 'as', 'crucial', 'one', 'Vivian', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'sexuality', 'language', 'interesting', 'also', 'nude', 'scene', 'one', 'cute', 'endearing', 'funny', 'payoff', 'Wil', 'Vivian', 'make', 'such', 'sweet', 'couple.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'Wu', 'cast', 'taking', 'film', 'Sundance', 'standard', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'What', 'missing', 'actual', 'trailer', 'Saving', 'Face', 'assume', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'now', 'have', 'caught', 'film', 'Wu', 'not', 'talk', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'commentary', 'track', 'will', 'get', 'much', 'fuller', 'appreciation', 'calculated', 'way', 'music', 'used', 'film', 'learn', 'scene', 'Graduate', 'supposed', 'remind', 'Graduate', 'Saving', 'Face', 'one', 'films', 'like', 'even', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'watch', 'have', 'better', 'understanding', 'how', 'well', 'constructed', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'impressed', 'Wu', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'first', 'time', 'screenwriter']",N/A

Her mother, has been exiled from her own parent's house because she is pregnant and unwed, a big no-no in Chinese American culture. The intrusion is particularity troublesome as Wil has just started to date sexy ballerina and out lesbian, Vivian (Lynn Chen). To get her life back, Wil sets her mother up on a variety of hilarious blind dates in the hope that she will find a husband.As Wil and Vivian's romance progresses, Will's work and her closeted nature begin to get in the way. Vivian becomes frustrated at Wil's reluctance to introduce her to her mother or acknowledge their relationship in public. When Vivian is offered a 4-year contract with the Paris Opera Ballet, she must choose between leaving the woman she has fallen in love with and advancing her career.The film was written and directed by Alice Wu, based on her own coming out experiences in New York's Chinese-American community. Witty dialogue and situations make the film a joy to watch. It is as much a film about acceptance within a community as it is about coming out and feeling comfortable with yourself, but most of all it is about doing what is right for you despite with others think.Michelle Krusiec portrays the meek somewhat timid Wil, in contrast to Lynn Chen's confident and alluring Vivian. Both women are infinitely watchable as they stumble through the challenges of a relationship. The love scenes between Wil and Vivian are filled with sensuality and playfulness. It is Joan Chen as Wil's mother however, that steals the show as the pregnant widow, her meaningful glances and timing are wonderfully comical.Chris AldersonAuthor of the 2013 Lesbian Film Guide",4,Humorous look at love and culture...,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,1763,"['Closeted', 'surgeon', 'Wil', 'Michelle', 'Krusiec', 'home', 'one', 'day', 'find', 'mother', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'sitting', 'doorstep', 'mother', 'been', 'exiled', 'own', 'parent', 'house', 'pregnant', 'unwed', 'big', 'no-no', 'Chinese', 'American', 'culture', 'intrusion', 'particularity', 'troublesome', 'Wil', 'just', 'started', 'date', 'sexy', 'ballerina', 'lesbian', 'Vivian', 'Lynn', 'Chen', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'Wil', 'mother', 'up', 'variety', 'hilarious', 'blind', 'dates', 'hope', 'will', 'find', 'husband.As', 'Wil', 'Vivian', 'romance', 'Will', 'work', 'closeted', 'nature', 'begin', 'get', 'way', 'Vivian', 'becomes', 'frustrated', 'Wil', 'reluctance', 'introduce', 'mother', 'acknowledge', 'relationship', 'public', 'When', 'Vivian', 'offered', '4-year', 'contract', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'Ballet', 'must', 'choose', 'leaving', 'woman', 'fallen', 'love', 'advancing', 'career.The', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Alice', 'Wu', 'based', 'own', 'coming', 'out', 'experiences', 'New', 'York', 'Chinese-American', 'community', 'Witty', 'dialogue', 'situations', 'make', 'film', 'joy', 'watch', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'acceptance', 'community', 'coming', 'out', 'feeling', 'comfortable', 'most', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'others', 'think.Michelle', 'Krusiec', 'meek', 'somewhat', 'timid', 'Wil', 'contrast', 'Lynn', 'Chen', 'confident', 'alluring', 'Vivian', 'women', 'are', 'infinitely', 'watchable', 'stumble', 'challenges', 'relationship', 'love', 'scenes', 'Wil', 'Vivian', 'are', 'filled', 'sensuality', 'playfulness', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'Wil', 'mother', 'however', 'show', 'pregnant', 'widow', 'meaningful', 'glances', 'timing', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'comical.Chris', 'AldersonAuthor', '2013', 'Lesbian', 'Film', 'Guide']",N/A

That is until her father throws her out for not naming the father of her unborn child.Wilhelmina (Michelle Krusiec) is a surgeon, has a very nice apartment in the Lower East Side of NYC and likes Women. She has almost no free time to date, is always at the hospital working and to put it bluntly: Ma showing up on her doorstep asking for shelter is an imposition...to say the least.But, in Alice Wu's ""Saving Grace"" this ""imposition"" naturally evolves into a re-connection between Wil and her mother that also blossoms into a deeply loving and respectful relationship. Wu, who also wrote as well as directs here has fashioned a film that steers clear of the chasm of melodrama and sentimentality that often plagues this type of scenario with her crisp dialogue, acidic wit and precise directing of the mise en scene.The character of Ma is played by the hauntingly beautiful Joan Chen and in Chen's hands Ma transcends her physical and social limitations and becomes a full-bodied, open-hearted person: ready for the prospect of really living,ready to give birth and not afraid of the future and maybe even finding a father for her baby.""Saving Grace"" is very wise, it is extremely charming and it is ultimately poignant in the manner of ""The Joy Luck Club"" or ""Hanging Up.""

If audience is fan of Amy Tan, you probably would feel familiar and comfortable with the story line: a 48 years old mother who got pregnant to a man whose identity remains unknown till the very end, a brilliant daughter who's a surgeon & the mum is only too fussed to hook her up with eligible bachelors but the only problem is that she has her eyes on a ballerina who happens to be the daughter of her supervisor, the busy body Chinese community who would run amok with the daily gossips, the children's obligation towards the elders at expense of their happiness, the mish-mash of two cultures and languages.  The movie is directed with compassion and tenderness.  It draws our attention and we can't help but laugh and cry with the plights of the characters.  I'm glad that it avoids the cliche outcomes and it does certainly constantly surprise the audience.  This movie is partially financed by Will Smith's production company called Overbrook Films and it's the kind of movie that Will wouldn't look out of place in.  In ""Saving Face"", there's a character of a coloured character living next door to Will and who would ocassionally instill the daughter with life's wisdom & that character, Jay would have been developed further but it didn't go anywhere.

931486,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B000AQOHN0,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[11, 52]","Alice Wu's directorial debut, Saving Face, is one of those movies that remind the viewer of a favorite junk food: the satisfaction that immediately follows the consumption is all too quickly followed by a nagging guilt at not having partaken of something more worthwhile.On the surface, Saving Face is a standard ethnic romantic comedy that follows the trail so successfully paved by My Big Fat Greek Wedding: central character's love life is complicated by the traditions of an extended family that won't let go of either its old world values or of the central character's right to make her own decisions.  The twists here are that the setting is the Chinese-American community of New York City, that the central character is, at least for the moment, lesbian, and the fact that she is juggling the added complication of her 48 year-old, widowed and mysteriously pregnant mother.To the film's credit, it does not sink into the slapstick that might have resulted if the Barbershop crew had gotten its hands on this material.  However, from the introduction of the main characters, through the ""here's an insider's view of the Chinese community"" scenes, to the all too predictable ending, the whole thing is just too darned pat.  The result is that the lesbian twist seems to have been an artifice added solely for the purpose of garnering attention; for in fact, Michelle Krusiec's character, Wil, could have been any daughter (or any son, for that matter) trying to find her/his own way in a world her/his parents and extended family do not really understand.More to the point, Director and Screen Writer Wu not only panders to stereotype expectations, but she slavishly employs them as though there might be no other possible way to tell this story.  Thus, Krusiec's grandfather (naturally) practices Tai Chi in the park, her best friend is (naturally) a gay black man who cries at soap operas and sits on the apartment steps in a complexion mask, and both she and her drop-dead gorgeous lover, Vivian, are (naturally) incredibly successful over-achievers.  Adding to the feeling that the lesbian theme was an artificial add-on is the fact that Wil's sexuality is never really firmly established.  If anything, she comes across as largely asexual for most of the film, thereby rendering Lynn Chen's Vivian as nothing so much as a sexual predator, who virtually stalks Wil, and shamelessly (if clumsily) seduces her in order to get her into bed.  Throughout the film (and until the all too predictable ending, which is telegraphed by an airport scene which is stolen straight out of The Boys in the Band) Wil seems a reluctant partner at best.  By contrast, Vivian is demanding, selfish and emotionally unappealing.The saving grace is the film's ""other"" central plot line, that of Wil's long-widowed, inexplicably pregnant mother.  All but stealing the film, Joan Chen's portrayal of ""Ma"" is nothing short of brilliant for most of the movie, and the film would have been vastly more impressive and interesting if it had focused solely on her, and if the needless distraction of her daughter's lesbian struggles had been left out entirely.  Only the sugary, improbable, Hollywood-happy ending forces Ms. Chen to shed the dignity and sympathy she builds for her character throughout the first 98% of the movie, and it is that ending which ultimately ruins this film, in spite of solid performances throughout.The best drama, and, admittedly, the best comedy, usually stems from the inherent conflict of incompatible elements unavoidably thrown together.  Moreover, ever since Romeo and Juliet, the unswerving devotion of star-crossed lovers has universally evoked audience sympathy, identification, and caring.  But the standard romantic comedy formula, which Ms. Wu slavishly follows, demands that everyone live happily ever after, even if it means that most characters must betray their long standing and deeply held beliefs, values, and feelings.  The problem is that real people don't act that way.  Thus, Vivian's willingness to reunite with Wil, Wil's family's acceptance of her sexuality and wedding (?) to her lesbian lover, her grandfather's jovial if resigned acceptance of both this and his unmarried daughter's pregnancy by a man over 20 years her junior, and the entire community's happy celebration of the entire situation is just too much.  Much like eating a large bag of Cheese Doodles as an afternoon snack, this film sort of felt good on the way down.  But there was no mistaking the queasiness that followed before the final credits had finished rolling.",1,My Big Fat Chinese Wedding,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,4573,"['Alice', 'Wu', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Saving', 'Face', 'one', 'movies', 'remind', 'viewer', 'favorite', 'junk', 'food', 'satisfaction', 'immediately', 'consumption', 'too', 'quickly', 'followed', 'nagging', 'guilt', 'not', 'having', 'partaken', 'something', 'more', 'surface', 'Saving', 'Face', 'standard', 'ethnic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'trail', 'so', 'successfully', 'paved', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'central', 'character', 'love', 'life', 'complicated', 'traditions', 'extended', 'family', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'old', 'world', 'central', 'character', 'right', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', 'twists', 'here', 'are', 'setting', 'Chinese-American', 'community', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'central', 'character', 'least', 'moment', 'lesbian', 'fact', 'juggling', 'added', 'complication', '48', 'year-old', 'widowed', 'mysteriously', 'pregnant', 'mother.To', 'film', 'credit', 'not', 'sink', 'slapstick', 'might', 'have', 'resulted', 'Barbershop', 'crew', 'had', 'gotten', 'hands', 'material', 'However', 'introduction', 'main', 'characters', 'here', 'insider', 'view', 'Chinese', 'community', 'scenes', 'too', 'predictable', 'ending', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'too', 'darned', 'pat', 'result', 'lesbian', 'twist', 'have', 'been', 'artifice', 'added', 'solely', 'purpose', 'garnering', 'attention', 'fact', 'Michelle', 'Krusiec', 'character', 'Wil', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'daughter', 'son', 'matter', 'trying', 'find', 'her/his', 'own', 'way', 'world', 'her/his', 'parents', 'extended', 'family', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'understand.More', 'point', 'Director', 'Screen', 'Writer', 'Wu', 'not', 'only', 'panders', 'stereotype', 'expectations', 'slavishly', 'might', 'be', 'other', 'possible', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'Thus', 'Krusiec', 'grandfather', 'naturally', 'practices', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'park', 'best', 'friend', 'naturally', 'gay', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'soap', 'operas', 'sits', 'apartment', 'steps', 'complexion', 'mask', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'lover', 'Vivian', 'are', 'naturally', 'incredibly', 'successful', 'over-achievers', 'Adding', 'feeling', 'lesbian', 'theme', 'was', 'artificial', 'add-on', 'fact', 'Wil', 'sexuality', 'never', 'really', 'firmly', 'established', 'anything', 'largely', 'asexual', 'most', 'film', 'thereby', 'rendering', 'Lynn', 'Chen', 'Vivian', 'nothing', 'so', 'much', 'sexual', 'predator', 'who', 'virtually', 'stalks', 'Wil', 'shamelessly', 'clumsily', 'order', 'get', 'bed', 'film', 'too', 'predictable', 'ending', 'telegraphed', 'airport', 'scene', 'stolen', 'straight', 'Boys', 'Band', 'Wil', 'reluctant', 'partner', 'best', 'contrast', 'Vivian', 'demanding', 'selfish', 'emotionally', 'unappealing.The', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'other', 'central', 'plot', 'line', 'Wil', 'long-widowed', 'inexplicably', 'pregnant', 'mother', 'stealing', 'film', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'portrayal', 'Ma', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'most', 'movie', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'vastly', 'more', 'impressive', 'interesting', 'had', 'focused', 'solely', 'needless', 'distraction', 'daughter', 'lesbian', 'struggles', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'entirely', 'Only', 'sugary', 'improbable', 'Hollywood-happy', 'ending', 'forces', 'Ms.', 'Chen', 'shed', 'dignity', 'sympathy', 'character', 'first', '98', '%', 'movie', 'ending', 'ultimately', 'film', 'spite', 'solid', 'performances', 'throughout.The', 'best', 'drama', 'admittedly', 'best', 'comedy', 'usually', 'inherent', 'conflict', 'incompatible', 'elements', 'unavoidably', 'together', 'Moreover', 'ever', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'unswerving', 'devotion', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'universally', 'evoked', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'identification', 'caring', 'standard', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'formula', 'Ms.', 'Wu', 'slavishly', 'everyone', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'even', 'most', 'characters', 'must', 'betray', 'long', 'standing', 'deeply', 'held', 'beliefs', 'values', 'feelings', 'problem', 'real', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'Thus', 'Vivian', 'willingness', 'reunite', 'Wil', 'Wil', 'family', 'acceptance', 'sexuality', 'wedding', 'lesbian', 'lover', 'grandfather', 'jovial', 'resigned', 'acceptance', 'unmarried', 'daughter', 'pregnancy', 'man', '20', 'years', 'junior', 'entire', 'community', 'happy', 'celebration', 'entire', 'situation', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'Much', 'eating', 'large', 'bag', 'Cheese', 'Doodles', 'afternoon', 'snack', 'film', 'sort', 'felt', 'good', 'way', 'down', 'was', 'mistaking', 'queasiness', 'followed', 'final', 'credits', 'had', 'finished', 'rolling']",N/A

Weller,"[1, 1]","On a par with Aimee & Jaguar, Night Is Falling, and even Desert Hearts, this solid, well-made film features great performances, nice lighting, well-though-out sound, and overall it's very nicely directed.  The script is also quite appealing, and I admire the chutzpah of having characters slip effortlessly between English and (subtitled) Mandarin.  In the very spare commentary, though, writer/director Alice Wu keeps describing the film as a romantic COMEDY, but while it's very romantic, it's really not all that funny.  It's certainly light, and there are a few mild chuckles to be found, but if this was supposed to be an actual comedy, it's failed on that one point.  But the relationships feel credible, the cast is quite talented, and the cinematography is exceptional - especially for such a small budget and short schedule (27 days).  The only quibble with the overall look of the film is that like a lot of modestly-budgeted indies, it's a bit claustrophobic in that there are very few exteriors.  We're in a hospital but we never see the outside of it, we're in a restaurant (the same one several times - a joke that fails) but we never see the outside of it, we don't see the outside of the grandparents' house or Vivian's apartment and we only get a brief glimpse of the outside of Wil's place.  We're outdoors for a couple of scenes in a park but they're also very constricted, and even a couple of night exteriors feel like a back-lot, though they were actually shot on the street in NYC.  But these are minor issues; it's a warm, pleasant romance with a handsome cast, well-produced and directed and with a lot of heart, and it's a welcome addition to the painfully small canon of lesbian-themed films.",5,One of the Better Lesbian Films...,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,1719,"['par', 'Aimee', 'Jaguar', 'Night', 'Falling', 'even', 'Desert', 'Hearts', 'solid', 'well-made', 'film', 'features', 'great', 'performances', 'nice', 'lighting', 'well-though-out', 'sound', 'overall', 'very', 'nicely', 'directed', 'script', 'also', 'quite', 'appealing', 'admire', 'chutzpah', 'having', 'characters', 'slip', 'effortlessly', 'English', 'subtitled', 'Mandarin', 'very', 'spare', 'commentary', 'though', 'writer/director', 'Alice', 'Wu', 'describing', 'film', 'romantic', 'COMEDY', 'very', 'romantic', 'really', 'not', 'funny', 'certainly', 'light', 'are', 'few', 'mild', 'chuckles', 'be', 'found', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'actual', 'comedy', 'failed', 'one', 'point', 'relationships', 'feel', 'credible', 'cast', 'quite', 'talented', 'cinematography', 'exceptional', 'especially', 'such', 'small', 'budget', 'short', 'schedule', '27', 'days', 'only', 'quibble', 'overall', 'look', 'film', 'lot', 'modestly-budgeted', 'indies', 'bit', 'claustrophobic', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'exteriors', ""'re"", 'hospital', 'never', 'see', 'outside', ""'re"", 'restaurant', 'same', 'one', 'several', 'times', 'joke', 'never', 'see', 'outside', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'outside', 'grandparents', 'house', 'Vivian', 'apartment', 'only', 'get', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'outside', 'Wil', 'place', ""'re"", 'outdoors', 'couple', 'scenes', 'park', ""'re"", 'also', 'very', 'constricted', 'even', 'couple', 'night', 'exteriors', 'feel', 'back-lot', 'were', 'actually', 'shot', 'street', 'NYC', 'are', 'minor', 'issues', 'warm', 'pleasant', 'romance', 'handsome', 'cast', 'well-produced', 'directed', 'lot', 'heart', 'welcome', 'addition', 'painfully', 'small', 'canon', 'lesbian-themed', 'films']",N/A

It has a broader topic; family, mother relationship, being true to yourself and others, and love. The director showed the chinese tradition living in America realistically, and I can relate to those gatherings so well that I laughed loudly. The chemistry between Michelle Krusiec and Lyn Chen was great! I could picture this happenning in real life!

The semi-retired actress turned director makes her comeback in an American/Chinese film with a role that is so delirously funny, sweet, and touching! For the first time in an American film, she delivered all her lines in Mandarin, making this bilingual sexy coming of age dramedy an authetic and delightful experience. If you thought you loved The Joy Luck Club, then this film is definitely going to be your cup of tea.This film deals with single motherhood, lesbianism, cultural clash, mid-life crisis/pregnancy/marriage, and breaking all the rules of the old traditions. Joan Chen(Ma) is a single mother in NYC, and she speaks no English. Her successful surgeon daughther Wilhemina(Michelle Krusiec) is a closeted lesbian who is on the verge of coming out to family and relatives. She eventually meets Vivian(Lynn Chen), an aspiring modern ballet dancer whom she falls madly in love with. Meanwhile, the relatives are trying to match her up with some guys.While she's going through some chaos in her love life, Ma is also having some dramatic issues to face. She starts to rent porno movies, and got herself pregnant by her secret boyfriend. Now she and her daughter would have to somehow come together to figure out how to unveal all the surprises to the friends and relatives. At the same time, Vivian is getting a job offer to dance in Europe, and it's hard for her to make up her mind to go or stay. Then in order to cover the truth about the father of the baby, the heavily pregnant Ma goes on husband hunting, so that she will be married before the baby is born. Will the mother and daughter be able save their FACE and be happy together with their folks?Although Joan Chen was quite unglamorous in most her screentime, she was still very beautiful, especially when she was all dolled up for ""the blind dates"" and the wedding. Her performance is so superior compare to Krusiec and Lynn. The two younger actresses had enough chemistry and heartfelt moments.I was so glad to have seen this film at the Toronto International Film Festival last fall, and it was amazing to see the director, cast members, and I got to meet Miss Chen after the movie. I spoke to her in Mandarin, and it was an unforgetable moment. I know she's going to receive rave reviews for this film, and I hope it will be a hit!",5,Joan Chen Gave the Funniest Performance of Her Career!,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,2590,"['Having', 'seen', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'various', 'Chinese', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'last', 'two', 'decades', 'must', 'say', 'certainly', 'funniest', 'performance', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'other', 'roles', 'films', 'Red', 'Rose', 'White', 'Rose', 'Tempation', 'A', 'Monk', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'semi-retired', 'actress', 'turned', 'director', 'comeback', 'American/Chinese', 'film', 'role', 'so', 'delirously', 'funny', 'sweet', 'touching', 'first', 'time', 'American', 'film', 'delivered', 'lines', 'Mandarin', 'making', 'bilingual', 'sexy', 'coming', 'age', 'dramedy', 'authetic', 'delightful', 'experience', 'thought', 'loved', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'then', 'film', 'definitely', 'going', 'be', 'cup', 'tea.This', 'film', 'deals', 'single', 'motherhood', 'lesbianism', 'cultural', 'clash', 'mid-life', 'crisis/pregnancy/marriage', 'breaking', 'rules', 'old', 'traditions', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'Ma', 'single', 'mother', 'NYC', 'English', 'successful', 'surgeon', 'daughther', 'Wilhemina', 'Michelle', 'Krusiec', 'closeted', 'lesbian', 'who', 'verge', 'coming', 'out', 'family', 'relatives', 'eventually', 'Vivian', 'Lynn', 'Chen', 'aspiring', 'modern', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'whom', 'madly', 'love', 'Meanwhile', 'relatives', 'are', 'trying', 'match', 'up', 'guys.While', 'going', 'chaos', 'love', 'life', 'Ma', 'also', 'having', 'dramatic', 'issues', 'face', 'rent', 'porno', 'movies', 'got', 'pregnant', 'secret', 'boyfriend', 'Now', 'daughter', 'would', 'have', 'somehow', 'come', 'together', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'unveal', 'surprises', 'friends', 'relatives', 'same', 'time', 'Vivian', 'getting', 'job', 'offer', 'dance', 'Europe', 'hard', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'go', 'stay', 'Then', 'order', 'cover', 'truth', 'father', 'baby', 'heavily', 'pregnant', 'Ma', 'husband', 'hunting', 'will', 'be', 'married', 'baby', 'born', 'Will', 'mother', 'daughter', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'FACE', 'be', 'happy', 'together', 'folks', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'was', 'quite', 'unglamorous', 'most', 'screentime', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'when', 'was', 'dolled', 'up', 'blind', 'dates', 'wedding', 'performance', 'so', 'superior', 'compare', 'Krusiec', 'Lynn', 'two', 'younger', 'actresses', 'had', 'enough', 'chemistry', 'heartfelt', 'moments.I', 'was', 'so', 'glad', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'Toronto', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'last', 'fall', 'was', 'amazing', 'see', 'director', 'cast', 'members', 'got', 'meet', 'Miss', 'Chen', 'movie', 'spoke', 'Mandarin', 'was', 'unforgetable', 'moment', 'know', 'going', 'receive', 'rave', 'reviews', 'film', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'hit']",N/A
