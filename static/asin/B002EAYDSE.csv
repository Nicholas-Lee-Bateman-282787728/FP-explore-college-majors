I was surprised to see Joan Weldon and James Whitmore both played in the Sci-Fi movie ""Them!"" form the same year. Joan looked a tad different so I had to do a double take. I remember Whitmore best as ""On Thursday We Leave for Home"" (1963) as Capt. William Benteen.When the commanding officer of 7th cavalry is dispatched by an arrow, Capt. Robert MacClaw (Guy Madison) a medical officer and short timer is forced to take over and take the troop home. On the way home the troops are pressed into a wagon train escort with the infantry. To keep up face for his cavalry troops Capt. MacClaw wares the insignia of a line officer and this may prove to be his downfall or the salvation of all.The story depicts a man with imagination and initiative in the military as if that was the exception. Yet the training nowadays includes that kind of resourcefulness and when deprived of resources to complete the commanders intent at every level.You will want a copy as this is a keeper and you will not get tired of re-watching.",5,You will be mesmerized,1305417600,"05 15, 2011",2011,1089,"['1954', 'film', 'one', 'first', 'was', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'Cinemascope', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'Joan', 'Weldon', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'played', 'Sci-Fi', 'movie', 'Them', 'same', 'year', 'Joan', 'looked', 'tad', 'different', 'had', 'do', 'double', 'take', 'remember', 'Whitmore', 'best', 'Thursday', 'Leave', 'Home', '1963', 'Capt', 'William', 'Benteen.When', 'commanding', 'officer', '7th', 'cavalry', 'dispatched', 'arrow', 'Capt', 'Robert', 'MacClaw', 'Guy', 'Madison', 'medical', 'officer', 'short', 'timer', 'forced', 'take', 'over', 'take', 'troop', 'home', 'way', 'home', 'troops', 'are', 'pressed', 'wagon', 'train', 'escort', 'infantry', 'keep', 'up', 'face', 'cavalry', 'troops', 'Capt', 'MacClaw', 'insignia', 'line', 'officer', 'may', 'prove', 'be', 'downfall', 'salvation', 'all.The', 'story', 'man', 'imagination', 'initiative', 'military', 'was', 'exception', 'training', 'kind', 'resourcefulness', 'when', 'deprived', 'resources', 'complete', 'commanders', 'intent', 'level.You', 'will', 'want', 'copy', 'keeper', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'tired', 're-watching']",The Command
1264998,A22O8H902FQRSL,B002EAYDSE,"Dana ""History Nut""","[5, 5]","This disk plays fine and is a great copy of this movie.The movie is typical of the 50s era cavalry/western movies. The action is pretty entertaining including a mounted charge firing revolvers. The troopers are using Winchester 92s which were never U.S. issue but most movies used them so they could fire rapidly. Spencer carbines would have been reasonable historically but even in the 50s no ammunition would have been available nor very many carbines. Trapdoor Springfields would have been correct and were plentiful and cheap but the on screen shooting would have been slower.The ""circle the wagons"" scenes near the end were also used in ""Hondo"" staring John Wayne. In all my reading of Western History, the Indians didn't ride around just outside a circle of wagons. That would be presenting yourself as a 'shooting gallery' target! They did lay siege to circles of wagons but would either charge home and overwhelm the defenders or stay back under cover and shoot at the defenders until they were incapacitated/dead. Again that doesn't play well in a movie.I enjoy the movie for its action and characters. Joan Weldon and James Whitmore went on to make ""Them"" and Guy Madison made many more movies including Westerns.
