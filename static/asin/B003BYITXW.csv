I should be upfront and say that I usually like SRK movies; however, he does not have a huge part this time.  Nevertheless, the other characters proved to be memorable and the actors gave good performances.  The story is not new (rich boy forced to marry to keep his millions, bride left alone after the wedding); however, Dulha Mil Gaya adds some twists and characters that make this movie very entertaining.  Some of the lines have stayed with me and I still laugh when I remember them.  If you take the time to see this film, I think you will be entertained.",5,"Fun, fun, fun",1275523200,"06 3, 2010",2010,595,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'upfront', 'say', 'usually', 'SRK', 'movies', 'however', 'not', 'have', 'huge', 'part', 'time', 'Nevertheless', 'other', 'characters', 'proved', 'be', 'memorable', 'actors', 'gave', 'good', 'performances', 'story', 'not', 'new', 'rich', 'boy', 'forced', 'marry', 'keep', 'millions', 'bride', 'left', 'alone', 'wedding', 'however', 'Dulha', 'Mil', 'Gaya', 'twists', 'characters', 'make', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'lines', 'have', 'stayed', 'still', 'when', 'remember', 'take', 'time', 'see', 'film', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'entertained']",N/A

1336249,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003BYITXW,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Shah Rukh Khan doesn't come into the picture until halfway thru the film, and it's a bit of an indictment that only then does the story become truly absorbing. DULHA MIL GAYA (in English: ""Found a Groom"") is an ensemble cast in the technical sense that it pairs up several actors together. It's certainly not a gathering of Bollywood's big names. Shah Rukh Khan is a superstar. And then there's the rest.Arranged marriages, mad dashes to the airport, and another incarnation of Eliza Dolittle - these never get old. Or do they? Shah Rukh numbers as one of the four central participants in this sometimes strained romantic comedy. In the idyllic West Indies, in Trinidad, Donsai Dhanraj (Fardeen Khan) and Shimmer Canhai (Sushimita Sen) while away their days in expansive frolic. Donsai, heir to the Dhanraj fortune, is a bachelor with commitment issues. He prefers to party hearty. Shimmer is a glamourous supermodel, and fiercely independent. But now here's life, all set to throw these two shallow friends a curve.Donsai learns of a clause in his father's will which he must fulfill within fifteen days lest he forfeit his inheritance: it compels him to scurry to India for a hasty court marriage to the unpolished Punjabi daughter of his father's old friend. But, once the marriage takes place, Donsai, unwilling to give up his bachelor habits, abandons his new bride, Samarpreet (newcomer Ishitta Sharrma), and flies back to Trinidad. He does send over a monthly check to his wife, so he's not a total cad.Except that Samarpreet can be starry-eyed only for so long. When three months elapse with nary a word from her husband, she journeys to the West Indies to see what's up. She's caught unprepared for the sheer excess and self-indulgence of Trinidad's high society. She eyeballs her husband at a wild poolside party, cozying up to the chicas, and her heart breaks. And when she flees the scene in misery, she gets run over. Samarpreet vows to teach Donjai a lesson. She gets help from the stylish Shimmer Canhai. It's only right. It was Shimmer's car what smacked her upside the head. And, it turns out, Shimmer may be superficial, but she does have an innate sense of what's right. Shimmer makes Samarpreet over, and the subterfuge begins. Samarpreet poses as one of Shimmer's posh friends, and Donjai, woudn't you know, is soon eyeing her.Soon after, Shah Rukh Khan makes his entrance, and it's a credit to his star power that the script cedes him an ego-boosting line (which he then delivers with charm, natch!): ""I've been spoken of at every instant in the story. So does it matter that it took me a while to make an entry?"" And now witness the film immediately rise in watchability. Pawan Raj Gandhi (Shah Rukh) - or, as everyone calls him, ""PRG"" - is an affable multi-millionaire who has forever been deeply besotted with Shimmer Canhai. The impression is that Shimmer returns his regard - but remember my saying that Shimmer is fiercely independent? Who knows how long PRG has patiently courted her? Shimmer keeps on preening, as always taking PRG for granted. Something's gotta give.DULHA MIL GAYA is fun, and made more fun once Shah Rukh walks onscreen and begins to impact the lives of those around him. While the plot unfolds in familiar patterns, the cast nurses us thru them, and I do like the energetic vibe. Ishitta Sharrma, in a likable performance, lends a freshness to her ingenue role, but she's overshadowed by a superb and surprisingly tongue-in-cheek Sushimita Sen. Sen seems to be having so much fun, gleefully portraying the self-absorbed Shimmer Canhai, injecting casual ennui into her dialogue. There's a wonderful airiness to how she carries on. I will say that, of the four core actors, Fardeen khan has the most thankless role, so I'm not sure that we should dump on him all that much. Given his character arc, given how much of an asshat Donjai is at the start, it's natural that you're not bowled over by him. DULHA MIL GAYA is two and a half hours long, which is too long, really. But there's a reason Shah Rukh Khan is India's most bankable star. And I've never more enjoyed Sushimita Sen. This is another one of them Bollywood films that starts out glamourizing the modern life style. And yet, by the end, it holds up the traditional values of family and marriage and the producing of a colorful musical number at the drop of a hat. Also, stick around for the outtakes during the closing credits.",3,"""Excuse me, girls.

1336252,AOUFNKPTMAIHO,B003BYITXW,vent,"[1, 1]","Pretty much a makeover movie with a catch . The girl is actually married to the rich guy already . The toad had to marry her within the next 15 days or loose a ton of money. He does it by arriving in her home town in Punjab and convinces  the family he is just in a hurry to fulfill his late fathers wishes and he will send for her very soon . So there is a quickie ceremony and the guy  promptly leaves our plain Jane back on the farm . Fifteen minutes later he's on a plane to go  home and starts to send checks to her aunt and uncles house where she lives . He lives all the way across the world in the west indies and has no intentions of getting married ever again so it doesn't matter to him if she stays in Punjab forever. He is forbidden divorce for 10 years by His late fathers will . She shyly waits for him to e'mail her as they have one in the village .He never answers her . Three months go by . She takes out the envelope with the check each month with eyes aglow only to end up depressed when there is nothing in the envelope except a single check . No letter to explain if he is okay. She decides to go to the islands to look for him. She runs into his best girl buddy but doesn't know it. Waiting for lift off she chats and tries to show the picture but the friend is snotty to her and doesn't look. She's goes quiet again.  She gets to the islands and is at his residence . She is stopped by security because he is very rich. Not letting this stop her she climbs the gate and sees her husband having a wild pool party and he is embracing a strange bikini wearing woman. She is totally dejected. This proves there was nothing wrong he is just a two timing creep. She walks away and its dark out . Hit by a car , she wakes up in the Girl buddies house. The story is told and there the story begins for real. She will make sure her best friend pays for his poor treatment of this somewhat backward but sweet girl. She will make her over and make him fall in love with a total stranger....his own wife. He doesn't even recognize her.This is a touching story about taking care of the ones who love you because you never know if they will continue to take your neglect. Excellent cast . SRK is an extended cameo and is perfect as the love interest for the girl buddy/ fairy god mother (who has an over the top gay friend as her secretary ). Watch and judge for yourself.
