It was truly a sensational film, though I had never heard of Gia Carangi.It is a film in which starts Gia (Angelina Jolie) as a street/city girl who had no manners and worked for her father in a small restraunt.  She was later discovered and introduced to a woman who saw a future in her.  The hunch was right.  Though Gia was one extroverted character, which made her unfavorable to other models, she was daring and extravagant.  She was willing to try new things, and she was not afraid to what extent.  She soon became quite popular.From her first shoot, she met the makup artists, in which she got an uneasy welcome.  But at that point, she met a person named Linda.  Linda was to be her savior.  Linda quickly learned how witty Gia was, not only when she heard Gia's quick retorts, but also when Gia asked her to pose with her in a nude protrait shoot with a photographer.  From this point onwards, feelings began to develop and so did Gia's career.In the beginning, Linda resisted to Gia's seduction and tried to convince herself that she was straight.  Linda even retained a boyfriend, which infuriated Gia.  Gia then started goijng back to her old ways--drugs and guys, like she did when she first was living in the city.Anyhow, I will not tell anymore, in fear that I may spoil the whole movie, but this is a film in which I would strongly recommend.  Though the genre may not be in the common mainstram, this film is metaphorical and can be related to many themes in life.  It can be mixed with fantasy vs. reality, in such that Gia was living in a fantasy, but ended becuae of reality.",5,"Different Taste, but Delicious. . . .",1073779200,"01 11, 2004",2004,1803,"['generally', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'films', 'such', 'kind', 'friend', 'offered', 'saying', 'was', 'not', 'porn', 'movie', 'anything', 'intriguing', 'film', 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'again', 'was', 'truly', 'sensational', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Gia', 'Carangi.It', 'film', 'Gia', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'street/city', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'manners', 'worked', 'father', 'small', 'restraunt', 'was', 'later', 'discovered', 'introduced', 'woman', 'who', 'saw', 'future', 'hunch', 'was', 'right', 'Gia', 'was', 'one', 'extroverted', 'character', 'made', 'unfavorable', 'other', 'models', 'was', 'daring', 'extravagant', 'was', 'willing', 'try', 'new', 'things', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'what', 'extent', 'soon', 'became', 'quite', 'first', 'shoot', 'met', 'makup', 'artists', 'got', 'uneasy', 'welcome', 'point', 'met', 'person', 'named', 'Linda', 'Linda', 'was', 'be', 'savior', 'Linda', 'quickly', 'learned', 'how', 'witty', 'Gia', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'when', 'heard', 'Gia', 'quick', 'retorts', 'also', 'when', 'Gia', 'asked', 'pose', 'nude', 'protrait', 'shoot', 'photographer', 'point', 'onwards', 'feelings', 'began', 'develop', 'so', 'did', 'Gia', 'career.In', 'beginning', 'Linda', 'resisted', 'Gia', 'seduction', 'tried', 'convince', 'was', 'straight', 'Linda', 'even', 'retained', 'boyfriend', 'infuriated', 'Gia', 'Gia', 'then', 'started', 'goijng', 'back', 'old', 'ways', 'drugs', 'guys', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'was', 'living', 'city.Anyhow', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'anymore', 'fear', 'may', 'spoil', 'whole', 'movie', 'film', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'genre', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'common', 'mainstram', 'film', 'metaphorical', 'can', 'be', 'related', 'many', 'themes', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'mixed', 'fantasy', 'vs.', 'reality', 'such', 'Gia', 'was', 'living', 'fantasy', 'ended', 'becuae', 'reality']",N/A

42900,A1IWR4FKPGE95C,0783113943,Carlos Rodriguez,"[10, 12]","Angelina Jolie gives the performance of her career in this film that depicts the meteoric rise and hard fall of supermodel Gia Carangi. This is the story of a tough, streetsmart and fast talking gril from Philadelphia who became one of the world's most successful models. Her intense beauty and wild ways open doors for all that was good and bad. She had a voracious appetite for sex with both men and women but what she loved most was definately to get high on cocaine and heroin. Her fast pace life filled with money,fame and cover shots for the world's top fashion magazines came spiralling out of control when she became a bonafide junkie that could not stop sticking needles in her arms and sniffing large quantities of coke on a daily basis. Finally her world came to a halt when she died at the age of 26 of Aids from apparently either a contaminated needle or the many sex partners that she had at various times in her life. It could be both but the film tends to draw the conclusion that she was infected with the virus thru a contaminated needle. Angelina Jolie who in my opinion is more beautiful than the real Gia, nails this character to the wall with an incredible intensity and finess. She gives a brilliant over the top performance and is with this movie in my opinion that she jumps to the category of the Hollywood heavyweights. She is truly an excellent actress and if this movie would have been release theatrically, she would of atleast grabbed an Oscar nomination as Best Actress. She did however won the Golden Globe for her performance in this incredible film. This movie even though it is sad and tragic and tough to watch at times is one of my favorites and I recommended to anyone who not only likes Angelina Jolie or wants to see what a great actress she is but also to the people who at one time or another have contimplated doing drugs and they can see for themselves what the final outcome is:SELF DESTRUCTION and probably even death like in the case of Gia who wanted to live a normal life but her inner demons (whatever they were) and obsession for the drugs and unprotected sex ended her life at an early age.

42904,A2DF325SNSGH2R,0783113943,Cedric's Mom,"[8, 9]","Gia Marie Carangi died at the age of 26 from AIDS.  When they tried to remove her body from the hospital bed, the skin literally fell off of her back.  These were the early days of AIDS in the mid-80s, before there were drugs to treat the disease.Gia stars Angelina Jolie in all of her wild child beauty, a 17-year-old girl with a belly full of abandonment who becomes the hottest model of her day.  Even with skills to successfully handle that life, modeling and high fashion is a dirty business, and Gia was the least likely to triumph. Her story is a downward slide into the hell of heroin addiction and eventually AIDS.Angelina Jolie (AJ) is a perfect fit for the role.  The story is told in mock documentary style, piecing together interviews with those who knew Gia professionally and personally.  There are also voice-over readings from Gia's journals.  And of course we get to see AJ in all kinds of great designer dresses and get ups.  The unrated version has a lot of nudity, too, because apparently Gia was known for her ""freedom of physical expression.""  The girl had no inhibitions.But her Achilles' heel was her emotional neediness.  Early in the movie, we see Gia with her mother, played by Mercedes Ruehl.  No wonder she had abandonment issues.  Her mother was childish and selfish, and she abandoned her young daughter and was no longer a part of her life.  Gia never recovered from the loss, and this abandonment set a pattern for her relationships and behavior the rest of her abbreviated life.  Gia preferred the love and physical comfort of women, but drugs were her true love.  When she discovered heroin, it was downhill all the way.  Her mother was clueless about her daughter's needs and the danger she was in.  At one point, Gia leaves modeling and enters drug rehab.  When she tries to live a life outside of modeling, her mother constantly pushes her to ""go back to work"" in modeling.  Clueless, childish, and selfish, the woman seemed incapable of loving anyone other than herself.  She boasts how ""we were like girlfriends"" when what Gia needed was a mother.  Faye Dunaway's character took Gia under her tutelage and nurturance, but ultimately Gia faced more abandonment and plunged further into heroin to ease her pain.This is a very effective movie that covers a lot of territory quickly-maternal abandonment, drug addiction, the brutality of the fashion industry, the popular culture of New York in the 80s, and of course AIDS.  For perspective, keep in mind that Gia was one of the first women in America to die from what was known as the ""gay plague"" in the 80s.  She died in 1986.  When we see Gia in the hospital after she's been diagnosed, the medical professionals attending her are covered from head to toe in tyvek; clearly, we had no idea what we were dealing with at that time.  How was it transmitted?  Air?  Saliva?  Could you get AIDS from touching someone who was infected?  As her mother said in the movie, ""we were all scared.""  She refused to let Gia come home and live with her during her illness; instead, she and her husband put Gia up in a cheap hotel until Gia was so sick she had to go to the hospital.Compare Gia's fate to Kate Moss losing modeling contracts because of cocaine abuse.  Did the fashion industry learn its lesson from Gia?  Two words here: tough love.Gia was a stunningly beautiful girl who lived a high profile and glamorous life.  But addiction's ends are always the same: jails, institutions, death.  It does not care about celebrity.  This movie stuck to my ribs, so to speak; I thought about Gia for days after viewing it.  What a deeply tragic and moving story.  The movie does have its flaws, but those are mostly in its construction.  For emotional impact and effectiveness, I give it a solid 4 stars.  I recommend this film for biography buffs and AJ fans, but for those considering a career in any area of the fashion industry, it is a must-see tale of caution.",4,A Wild Child Dies Young,1130716800,"10 31, 2005",2005,3943,"['Gia', 'Marie', 'Carangi', 'died', 'age', '26', 'AIDS', 'When', 'tried', 'remove', 'body', 'hospital', 'bed', 'skin', 'literally', 'fell', 'back', 'were', 'early', 'days', 'AIDS', 'mid-80s', 'were', 'drugs', 'treat', 'disease.Gia', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'wild', 'child', 'beauty', '17-year-old', 'girl', 'belly', 'full', 'abandonment', 'who', 'hottest', 'model', 'day', 'Even', 'skills', 'successfully', 'handle', 'life', 'modeling', 'high', 'fashion', 'dirty', 'business', 'Gia', 'was', 'least', 'likely', 'triumph', 'story', 'downward', 'slide', 'hell', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'eventually', 'AIDS.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'AJ', 'perfect', 'fit', 'role', 'story', 'told', 'mock', 'documentary', 'style', 'piecing', 'together', 'interviews', 'who', 'knew', 'Gia', 'professionally', 'personally', 'are', 'also', 'voice-over', 'readings', 'Gia', 'journals', 'course', 'get', 'see', 'AJ', 'kinds', 'great', 'designer', 'dresses', 'get', 'ups', 'unrated', 'version', 'lot', 'nudity', 'too', 'apparently', 'Gia', 'was', 'known', 'freedom', 'physical', 'expression', 'girl', 'had', 'inhibitions.But', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'was', 'emotional', 'neediness', 'Early', 'movie', 'see', 'Gia', 'mother', 'played', 'Mercedes', 'Ruehl', 'wonder', 'had', 'abandonment', 'issues', 'mother', 'was', 'childish', 'selfish', 'abandoned', 'young', 'daughter', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'part', 'life', 'Gia', 'never', 'recovered', 'loss', 'abandonment', 'set', 'pattern', 'relationships', 'behavior', 'rest', 'abbreviated', 'life', 'Gia', 'preferred', 'love', 'physical', 'comfort', 'women', 'drugs', 'were', 'true', 'love', 'When', 'discovered', 'heroin', 'was', 'downhill', 'way', 'mother', 'was', 'clueless', 'daughter', 'needs', 'danger', 'was', 'one', 'point', 'Gia', 'modeling', 'enters', 'drug', 'rehab', 'When', 'live', 'life', 'modeling', 'mother', 'constantly', 'go', 'back', 'work', 'modeling', 'Clueless', 'childish', 'selfish', 'woman', 'seemed', 'incapable', 'loving', 'anyone', 'other', 'how', 'were', 'like', 'girlfriends', 'when', 'what', 'Gia', 'needed', 'was', 'mother', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'character', 'took', 'Gia', 'tutelage', 'nurturance', 'ultimately', 'Gia', 'faced', 'more', 'abandonment', 'plunged', 'further', 'heroin', 'ease', 'pain.This', 'very', 'effective', 'movie', 'lot', 'territory', 'quickly-maternal', 'abandonment', 'drug', 'addiction', 'brutality', 'fashion', 'industry', 'popular', 'culture', 'New', 'York', '80s', 'course', 'AIDS', 'perspective', 'keep', 'mind', 'Gia', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'women', 'America', 'die', 'what', 'was', 'known', 'gay', 'plague', '80s', 'died', '1986', 'When', 'see', 'Gia', 'hospital', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'medical', 'professionals', 'attending', 'are', 'covered', 'head', 'toe', 'tyvek', 'clearly', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'were', 'dealing', 'time', 'How', 'was', 'transmitted', 'Air', 'Saliva', 'Could', 'get', 'AIDS', 'touching', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'infected', 'mother', 'said', 'movie', 'were', 'scared', 'refused', 'let', 'Gia', 'come', 'home', 'live', 'illness', 'instead', 'husband', 'put', 'Gia', 'up', 'cheap', 'hotel', 'Gia', 'was', 'so', 'sick', 'had', 'go', 'hospital.Compare', 'Gia', 'fate', 'Kate', 'Moss', 'losing', 'modeling', 'contracts', 'cocaine', 'abuse', 'Did', 'fashion', 'industry', 'learn', 'lesson', 'Gia', 'Two', 'words', 'here', 'tough', 'love.Gia', 'was', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'who', 'lived', 'high', 'profile', 'glamorous', 'life', 'addiction', 'ends', 'are', 'always', 'same', 'jails', 'institutions', 'death', 'not', 'care', 'celebrity', 'movie', 'stuck', 'ribs', 'so', 'speak', 'thought', 'about', 'Gia', 'days', 'viewing', 'What', 'deeply', 'tragic', 'moving', 'story', 'movie', 'have', 'flaws', 'are', 'mostly', 'construction', 'emotional', 'impact', 'effectiveness', 'give', 'solid', '4', 'stars', 'recommend', 'film', 'biography', 'buffs', 'AJ', 'fans', 'considering', 'career', 'area', 'fashion', 'industry', 'must-see', 'tale', 'caution']",N/A

Michale Gross, in his 1995 book ""Model,"" the most exhaustive and exhausting of all books on the fashion industry dismisses her as ""a bisexual drug abuser who had a short but visible career.""As you can quickly tell from the sole opening credit (Angelina Jolie, of course) this movie is an Angelina Jolie vehicle.  The problem is that this vehicle sputters throughout due to overwrought dialogue and acting which ties nicely back into the overwrought intro.With her post-lip, pre-nose job plastic surgery Angelina Jolie looks remarkably similar to Katie Holmes at certain angles.This type of movie-making reminds one of the old gangster movies of the '30's and '40's.

And before Jolie nailed a supporting Oscar for ""Girl Interrupted,"" she snared a Golden Globe for an utterly transfixing performance as the model Gia in this 1998 bio-pic. Directed by Michel Cristofer, ""Gia"" culls from corroborating resource material (""A Thing of Beauty: The Tragedy of Supermodel Gia"" by Stephen Fred, perhaps the definitive biographical work) to capture the Phialdephia-born Gia's skyrocket to fame - she went to Vogue covers just two years after graduating from high school - and as rapid a descent, the victim of a self-destructive psyche ravaged by an insecure childhood and ill preparation for stunning beauty and uninvited fame, wealth and power. Gia died in 1986 from complications of AIDS (from IV heroin use), and her self-fueled destruction might be called just another tale of beauty and fame gone tragic. But Jolie's craftsmanship salvages the film from that fate with a stunningly honest and ethical performance. So natural is Jolie in the role of Gia that it might be offensive to dismiss her acting prowess as ""coming naturally."" More to the point, Jolie's talent here is honest, and it is that honesty which makes Jolie unblinkingly compelling here.

But being a huge fan of Angelina Jolie I watched it. After it was over I just sat there thinking (a sign of a very good  movie in my opinion). I had run the gamet of every emotion possible in just  two hours. I felt like I had just met someone quite amazing and they told  me their life story.  Angelina Jolie has proven herself in the past as an  amazing actress, but this film established her as a master of the craft. No  one could have come close to the power she radiates while showing us who  Gia was. I don't say &quot;plays Gia&quot; because it was definitly more  than portraying a character. She became Gia.

Angelina Jolie's performance here is nothing less than incredible, in fact there was a short time when I thought she's really Gia herself and that she's really troubled...that's how convincing her act is. Mercedes R makes a great support role...and a mother as well.I have seen this movie a number of times since it was let out and its one of my favorites. Jolie is super-impressive as she portrays the highs and lows of Gia's fame: strutting through a crowd of admirers, the look on her face saying, ""I'm GIA, and you're nobody!""; indulging in glamour drug of the moment, cocaine; fiercely proclaiming her love for Linda (Elizabeth Mitchell), right in front of Linda's boyfriend; tearfully begging her visiting mother (Mercedes Ruehl) to stay with her, then hurling obscenities at her while throwing her baggage out of the apartment; and quietly and gracefully accepting the most tragic news about her health, just as she's finally getting her life on track. This movie deals very frankly with Gia's sexuality and there is some nudity and scenes of sexuality, but looking past the sex and the drugs and the tough exterior she displayed (especially when someone took her knife away from her), you see a very lost, fragile person. Gia is almost childlike in her disillusionment about the fashion industry, and you feel it in the way she fantasizes about a ""normal"" life with children, the way she feels like people regard her as a ""piece of meat"" with no brains, and the way she is so truly hurt by a fellow model calling her hateful names in a jealous rage.I think this movie is something that should be seen by people of all ages, regardless of its sexual content, because it carries a strong anti-drug message as well as a touching story we can all identify with even if a lot of us are not blessed with the kind of glorious physical beauty Gia was blessed with.

This movie, however, is MADE by the acting of Angelina Jolie, who portrays the supermodel Gia.  The movie opens with Jolie/Gia as a motorcycle punk in a working-class Philadephia family, and (seriously) the viewer wonders how she could ever be a model, with her punk-rock haircut and attitude.  A beautiful transformation occurs as Gia starts to rule the NY modeling world.  She is more magnificent than anyone else, that is, until drug ravage her body, her face, her composure, and her performance on shoots.The movie centers on Gia's relationship with a female makeup artist.  The two have a very brief affair, after which Gia obsesses over her lover until she manages to steal her away from her boyfriend.  Their relationship is on and off again throughout Gia's rise, fall, comeback, and life in rehabilitation.The world today is a different place than it was in the mid 1980's.  Gia was diagnosed with ""Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,"" but she's never heard of that before.  In fact, she is the first woman her doctor has diagnosed with AIDS (she was an IV drug user, but he didn't realize the significance of that at the time).  When Gia is diagnosed, all she can ask is how she can get rid of it???, which will surely break the modern viewers' heart.

I was just browsing the old stacks & seeing an early Angelina Jolie effort  my interest was piqued. I figured just another beautiful, junkie, dead movie. But she does a stand-out job in this rather lackluster cable tv movie. Gia was a talented, out-of-the box, gorgeous super model. She was also a tortured soul, uncertain of her sexual orientation, fabulously successful & rich too quick. She gets a taste of nose candy & is soon. is mainlining heroin. A few half-hearted attempts to kick the habit fail. Her fall is as spectacular as her rise as she gives up the only person she really loves for the drug. You'd figure if you didn't know the story that an OD would be her end. From using contaminated needles she becomes one of that first generation to contract AIDs.

Angelina Jolie was simply too convincing, the directing was simply too unique and the script was too crafty. This film avoided the averageness of countless other 'drug films' simply by painting a mosaic so raw, that you couldn't help but love, hate, cringe at and root for Gia at the same time. The film, while letting you glimpse into the insecurities and motivations of our tragic hero, consistently pushed her just out of reach so as to keep us puzzled and curious. All said and done, though, Jolie and the gang have created a flawless work of tragic art.The only reason not to give it 5 stars is that as most movies based on life stories, it is a bit anti-climactic and unbalanced. With most plots, the writers are at liberty to create an upward story with a clear climax and this film simply didn't have it. It slid up and down, high and low, mirroring Gia's confusion.

Truth be told, I was not drawn to this movie at first because of the story, what drew me and I'm sure many others to it is the star Angelina Jolie.  After her success in the Tomb Raider movies, I thought it would be interesting to see some of her past work, thus this movie became very interesting!Angelina Jolie performs admirably and brilliantly in this film, almost to perfection in what I'm sure is an even greater range in her talents.  The depth of the character she portrays does compel you to the character despite already knowing the tragic outcome.  Praise goes to Faye Dunaway and Mercedes Ruehl for their efforts in this film as well.This true life sad story is told well in the film; however, the director, Michael Cristofer, chose an almost cryptic style in which to tell the tragic story of Gia's life which, at times, detracts from the overall telling of the story.  The score for the film does do well in what it's designed to do, augment the overall feel of the movie.The Premise:&quot;Gia&quot; is the overly tragic story of Gia Marie Carangi; a young and extremely beautiful woman from Philadelphia who suffered the break up of her parents at a young age and then in her late teens, a photographer stumbles upon her and not long thereafter the life of a supermodel overwhelms her.  Incapable of dealing with separation of any form, she turns to drugs!What follows from there is a heart wrenching and very telling true life tragedy of what happened to this beautiful young woman.I would definitely recommend this HBO movie; one for the story itself and two for the exceptional performance by Angelina Jolie in this heartrending tale.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Cast &amp; Crew Bios-Photo Gallery",4,Gia - A tragic true tale!,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,1806,"['quot', 'Gia', 'quot', 'quite', 'simply', 'haunting', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'Gia', 'Marie', 'Carangi', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'was', 'not', 'drawn', 'movie', 'first', 'story', 'what', 'drew', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'others', 'star', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'success', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'movies', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'past', 'work', 'thus', 'movie', 'became', 'very', 'interesting', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'admirably', 'brilliantly', 'film', 'almost', 'perfection', 'what', ""'m"", 'sure', 'even', 'greater', 'range', 'talents', 'depth', 'character', 'compel', 'character', 'already', 'knowing', 'tragic', 'outcome', 'Praise', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Mercedes', 'Ruehl', 'efforts', 'film', 'well.This', 'true', 'life', 'sad', 'story', 'told', 'well', 'film', 'however', 'director', 'Michael', 'Cristofer', 'chose', 'almost', 'cryptic', 'style', 'tell', 'tragic', 'story', 'Gia', 'life', 'times', 'detracts', 'overall', 'telling', 'story', 'score', 'film', 'do', 'well', 'what', 'designed', 'do', 'augment', 'overall', 'feel', 'movie.The', 'Premise', 'quot', 'Gia', 'quot', 'overly', 'tragic', 'story', 'Gia', 'Marie', 'Carangi', 'young', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Philadelphia', 'who', 'suffered', 'break', 'parents', 'young', 'age', 'then', 'late', 'teens', 'photographer', 'not', 'long', 'thereafter', 'life', 'supermodel', 'Incapable', 'dealing', 'separation', 'form', 'drugs', 'What', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'very', 'telling', 'true', 'life', 'tragedy', 'what', 'happened', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'HBO', 'movie', 'one', 'story', 'two', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'heartrending', 'tale', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Cast', 'amp', 'Crew', 'Bios-Photo', 'Gallery']",N/A

It is an introspective of how she deals with the people in the business and her relationships with a few individuals that she is intimate with. She is herself through all her dealings with them. She seems to not be intimated at all by people who may exude power or fame. Her manner starts out and stays pretty needy throughout the film until the end where she seems to be able to be with herself more and feel comfortable with that. Her main relationships are with her on and off again girlfriend, her best male friend, her agent, and her mother. She gets drawn into drugs yet does not really show much of her dealings with the drug world. It just shows her breakdown of spirit and her eventual suspended state of neediness of people than how it transfered to drugs. Of course she is beautiful but her personality is not about that and you tend to focus on who she is. The story shows exercepts of her journal writing and she tended to want to learn who she was but didn't want to be with herself for long periods of times. She was dependent on her intimate others. They were all flattered and enchanted by her attention but they were unable to fufill her neediness and this always led to the inbalance of the relationship. Thus her need for drugs turned out to be the next source of addiction. The clothes and makeup were fun to watch and added to the glamour of Angelina Jolie. The ending is sober and we get to see the strength behind the vulnerable girl that develops in her last years of her life.

On first viewing, I found the film good, and Angelina's performance pretty impressive, but I  was of the opinion that Gia was a confused, annoying woman who contributed  to her own demise.  Then I happened to watch the film again and this time,  I was totally blown away.  Why, I couldn't tell you for sure.  Maybe it's  because the performance by Angelina is so layered, so intriguing and so  complex and one that you have to watch at least twice to appreciate on all  of its levels.  She captures the sexy/sensual Gia, the confident young Gia  taking on the modeling world and the scared little girl Gia, who only  wanted to be loved.Even if you're one who would write off the  performance as showy after the first viewing (Gia's life had the  ingredients that made for great drama), for some reason, you do come back  again, and at that point, you're hooked.  That second time you watch  closely, and you see how Angelina turns Gia from someone who I felt  contributed to her own demise, to someone I was sympathetic towards after  the second viewing.  Angelina's performance has me admiring Gia for how she  lived life on her own terms and feeling heartbroken that it had to end so  soon.  Elizabeth Mitchell and Mercedes Ruehl are also very good, in strong  supporting roles, playing the two women in Gia's life that, in the end,  mattered most.  The scene that I found most powerful was when Mitchell's  character is trying to keep Gia from choosing  drugs over her.  It is at  that moment that she realizes she's got to get away because she can't stand  to see Gia destroy herself.  I also love the closing scene, where Gia  arises and walks on to eternity, her words serving as a punctuation to a  life lived on its own terms.It's Angelina's performance that is  amazing, and the power of that performance lingers for quite a while.  If  this film was theatrically released, there would have been no way she would  have lost the Oscar that year.

42967,A2T7TZBOTP68C7,0783113943,"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[5, 6]","Gia is a knockout, daring film.  It tells the true story of the rise and fall of 80's supermodel Gia Carrangi.  Many reviewers have said they never heard of Gia until the movie.  In the cruel fashion world, Gia was forgotten as fast as she became famous.  Not one person from the fashion industry attended her funeral.  The man who wrote the book on which this film was based also coined the term 'fashionista' for his book.  The word has since become a staple in the English language.Angelina Jolie was made for this role; she deserved the awards and recognition she received for it.  If this film had been made for theaters rather than HBO, she should have won an Oscar.In Gia, Gia/Jolie is the sun, and all the other characters revolve around her.  From her inauspicious beginnings in New York City to her photo shoots all over the world, Gia desperately seeks that which she was denied as a child - love.  The tragedy is that once she finally finds love, Gia is so scarred emotionally and from drugs, that she is unable to accept it.  Mercedes Ruel gives a masterful, subtle performance as Gia's self-centered mother who abandoned her daughter when she was 11.The drugs, glamor, and glitz of the 80's fashion world are portrayed in both gritty and glamorous fashion.  One of the most striking scenes is when Gia is dressed for a photo shoot as a geisha in a red dress.  This scene is so riveting and well done I watched it a dozen times.  She is standing in a gritty alley with red paper lanterns hanging over the concrete.  The whole scene is surreal, and is a great portrayal of Gia's life and of the 80's.Jolie keeps nothing inside for this performance.  She is naked, both physically and emotionally.  And the jazz soundtrack is captivating and mesmerizing.  In fact, I am seeking to purchase just the soundtrack.",4,"Hello, Baby",1088035200,"06 24, 2004",2004,1821,"['Gia', 'knockout', 'daring', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'rise', 'fall', '80', 'supermodel', 'Gia', 'Carrangi', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'never', 'heard', 'Gia', 'movie', 'cruel', 'fashion', 'world', 'Gia', 'was', 'forgotten', 'as', 'fast', 'became', 'famous', 'Not', 'one', 'person', 'fashion', 'industry', 'attended', 'funeral', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'also', 'coined', 'term', 'book', 'word', 'become', 'staple', 'English', 'language.Angelina', 'Jolie', 'was', 'made', 'role', 'deserved', 'awards', 'recognition', 'received', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'theaters', 'rather', 'HBO', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar.In', 'Gia', 'Gia/Jolie', 'sun', 'other', 'characters', 'revolve', 'inauspicious', 'beginnings', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'photo', 'shoots', 'world', 'Gia', 'desperately', 'was', 'denied', 'child', 'love', 'tragedy', 'once', 'finally', 'love', 'Gia', 'so', 'scarred', 'emotionally', 'drugs', 'unable', 'accept', 'Mercedes', 'Ruel', 'masterful', 'subtle', 'performance', 'Gia', 'self-centered', 'mother', 'who', 'abandoned', 'daughter', 'when', 'was', '11.The', 'drugs', 'glamor', 'glitz', '80', 'fashion', 'world', 'are', 'portrayed', 'gritty', 'glamorous', 'fashion', 'One', 'most', 'striking', 'scenes', 'when', 'Gia', 'dressed', 'photo', 'shoot', 'geisha', 'red', 'dress', 'scene', 'so', 'riveting', 'well', 'done', 'watched', 'dozen', 'times', 'standing', 'gritty', 'alley', 'red', 'paper', 'hanging', 'concrete', 'whole', 'scene', 'surreal', 'great', 'portrayal', 'Gia', 'life', ""80's.Jolie"", 'keeps', 'nothing', 'inside', 'performance', 'naked', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'jazz', 'soundtrack', 'captivating', 'mesmerizing', 'fact', 'am', 'seeking', 'purchase', 'just', 'soundtrack']",N/A

Then I compared the two performances and discovered why I couldn't 'connect' with Gia. Granted, the real Gia was quite a wild-child, but Angelina is not for one second convincing as a bisexual supermodel in this over-the-top dramatic TV Movie.I think the worst part is the actual narrative. No points for the script here. The end, which should have been touching, is instead cloying and demanding of our sympathy, which I felt was a bit cheap. Also, Angelina comes across only as Angelina in almost every frame of this film. I think this was the curse of being early in her career, but seriously, it was very clear to me while watching this that Jolie had absolutely no idea of how to be an actress or how to emote.Also, Gia was supposed to be a skinny supermodel, but Angelina here is slightly on the heavier side. Did anyone else notice this? Especially in that nude scene where she is having that morning conversation with her lesbian lover. I was left wondering why exactly people thought THAT body was all so exciting, because frankly it looked like everywoman. Not bad, just not spectacular.""Gia""'s primary strengths come when Angelina lets her guard down a bit (which is rarely). The picture suffers due to Jolie, because she is supposed to be in every scene of it. To such an extent, that almost everyone else is reduced to the part of a pathetic walk-on. They also tried to give this film an early 1980s vibe that absolutely did not work, plus Jolie's hideous hairstyles only made me disrespect the filmmakers even more.I am giving this a generous three stars, because I believe the true story of Gia deserved to be told. She was thrown out of the fashion world, and cut off even by close friends. Angelina conveys nothing of the mental anguish here, and by the end its hard to feel sorry for her because ten minutes of her all teary was much more than I could tolerate.Watch this, but be forewarned. If you're an Angie fan, you have to watch this as it did bring her much critical acclaim at the time, and actually launched her into Hollywood.

It does get annoying when this person is talking about Gia but who doesn't actually appear in Gia's life until later in the film, so you don't have a clue who they are.Of course, Angelina Jolie stars as Gia, throwing herself so much into the role that you forget where to draw the line between Angelina and Gia. Angelina almost became Gia, and it's hard to understand why exactly this film isn't better known. Forget Tomb Raider, forget Girl, Interrupted, this should have been THE film of Angelina's career. Why it wasn't, is beyond me. The story is a stunning portrayal of a young girl thrown in at the deep end, and not knowing what to do.Alongside Angelina, Faye Dunaway plays a small, but very much needed role in this. She stars as Gia's agent, and also her mentor. Gia will phone her in the middle of the night to talk, and when she dies, Gia is left alone and lost. Thus begins her downward spiral into the fatal world of drugs.By the back cover of the DVD, you know Gia's character dies, so you're expecting that. What you don't expect is how drawn out it is, but how fast the film goes. At just under 2 hours long, it was over before I knew it. Once she's discovered as having AIDS, the film quickly progresses into a drugs/AIDS story, and its horrifying. The end scenes of Angelina show how great an actress she is, and just what drugs can do to you.There is a lot of nudity in this film. But it's done very well - or as well as it can be, when there are almost full frontal shots, but from far away. You would think this would turn you off the film, but it really attributes to what the film is. Angelina seems to have no qualms about her body and flaunted it to the max in this. She also flaunted her (small) collection of tattoos, but no Billy Bob scrawled across her upper arm, as this was before he came on the scene.Angelina is one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood at the moment. She's not your classic beauty - as Gia says in the film, ""a woman isn't a woman unless she's blonde"". But Angelina is beautiful; there's no doubt about it. She's one of these lucky women who look good without any makeup - not that I'm jealous of course!Gia's character almost seemed schizophrenic at some points, and this could have been because of the drugs, but she's also very insecure about her various relationships. It was hard to see her change from a happy, smiley young girl, to an angry, crying woman, throwing stuff around.I've never heard of Gia before this, but now I'm pleased I have this movie, and I can watch it whenever I want to. She was only 26 when she died, which is horrifying, considering how much she did in her short life. And she started modelling when she was 17, and started taking drugs soon after. But the people in the modelling world didn't seem to care that one of their finest models was doing drugs, as shown in the movie.HIV can take a while to develop into AIDS, but the doctors said in the film, that it could have been from sharing a needle. You see very graphically the first time Gia injects herself, whereas before she was just sniffing. You don't see her injecting again after this, which made me think this was when she got HIV then.It's quite scary as the film goes on, before you realise there is anything wrong with her, because you notice her hair getting greyer and greyer, and bags appearing under her eyes.The very start, when you see Gia getting makeup put on her, is a bit freaky, but I won't explain why, you have to watch the end, as the scenes get repeated.All in all, a great film, and definitely re-watchable.

42981,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,0783113943,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","Gia is a biographical movie that tells the story of the rise and fall of model Gia Carangi who shot to fame in the late 1970s early 1980s.  Her career and ultimately her life was cut short due to heavy drug use, and contracting AIDS from using infected needles.  The story spans essentially a 9 year time frame from when she was discovered at 17 to her death at age 26.The strength of the movie is the acting.  While all the actors do a wonderful job, Angelina Jolie really shines.  It was one of her relatively early roles, but it established that she had real acting chops.  The role really did call for someone who could pull off being flawlessly gorgeous when all made up, but could also pull off being crazy, vulnerable, caring, dramatic and funny.  Angelina was able to do all of that, and as a result it is more than just a movie where she looks hot and is naked for a few minutes.As for the disc itself.  The movie probably looks the same on DVD and blu ray, or pretty close to it.  The picture on the blu ray looks fine for a movie that is a little older now.  Obviously there are special effects or landscape shots that make the blu ray visuals all that much better.  Unfortunately there are no extras included on the disc.  It is simply the move and that is it.

42983,A15ORUD5TVNIV6,0783113943,Mom Pressfour,"[10, 11]","This is a review of the unrated DVD edition of *Gia*, an HBO television movie originally aired in 1998. It stars Angelina Jolie as Gia Marie Carangi. Mercedes Ruehl is Kathleen Carangi, Gia's mother. Eric Michael Cole plays T.J., Gia's sometimes boyfriend. Elizabeth Mitchell is Linda, Gia's girl lover. Fay Dunaway is Wilhemina Cooper, Gia's manager at the Wilhemina Modeling Agency. Michael Christofer directs. Two years after *Gia*, he would direct Ms Jolie and Antonio Banderas in *Original Sin.**Gia* the movie is far from perfect. But ""Gia"" the character played by Angelina Jolie is one of the very best dramatic performances ever put to film. The emotional nakedness that Ms Jolie displays reminds me of young Timothy Hutton in *Ordindary People* (1980), a most moving role that won the Oscar for this new face in Hollywood. Many filmgoers agree that if *Gia* had been made for cinema, Ms Jolie would have likewise won an Oscar. She won a Golden Globe, her second.About *Gia* the film, it doesn't try hard enough to show us what actually happened to Gia Marie Carangi. Perhaps that's because many of the people who knew Carangi and worked with her are still alive; maybe some of them have objections to a real biopic. I don't know. What I do know is that the HBO *Gia* is more of a fictionalized impression of ""America's first supermodel"" than a true presentation of the facts of her life. All the ""talking heads"" who speak about Gia as if they knew her personally are actors who did not know her at all. Mercedes Ruehl as Kathleen Carangi has the most to tell us; but the real mother of Gia Marie Carangi denounced the film as a misrepresentation of her daughter.I'll give one example of misrepresentation. In the HBO film, the character Linda plays a major role in Gia's life. But there was no Linda at all. In fact there was, as the film shows, a makeup girl who was photographed with Gia on an indoor set with a chain link fence as a prop. But though some said she was sexually involved with Gia, that girl herself denied it. Apart from what Gia did or did not have going with the makeup girl, she did have a lesbian girlfriend. But like Gia, this girlfriend was addicted to heroin. So the Linda played by Elizabeth Mitchell who is drugfree and who so tenderly helps Gia get clean is an invention of the scriptwriters.An individual who maintains an Internet website dedicated to the real Gia Marie Carangi declares that Gia's journal (the one Ms Jolie sometimes speaks offscreen from, with the verse that begins: ""Life and death, energy and peace..."") is a fiction. Those words are not, this invididual insists, written by Gia Marie Carangi. For my part as a reviewer of the DVD, all I can say, once more, is that I don't know. But there is no denying that the filmscript as a biography is highly questionable.Stylistically the film is a little dull. But I suppose that's normal for a TV movie. The cinematography shifts between color and black-and-white without rhyme nor reason. Either the real Gia was ambidexterous, or there's a major continuity blooper. We see the young Gia, played by Mila Kunis, starting her journal. She writes with her right hand. Later, when noted southpaw Angelina Jolie plays the adult Gia, she carves her name into a desktop with a knife held in her left hand. And with her left hand she signs out on her methadone treatment.I could go on and on picking the movie apart AS A MOVIE. Finally I'd end up giving *Gia* a rating of 3 stars at best...if it wasn't for what Angelina Jolie did with her role. When she is on screen, she mesmerizes the camera. It's not just her beauty. It's certainly not her sex scene with Elizabeth Mitchell accompanied by the drone of a female singer on the soundtrack. (Corny!) It's three things: 1) the acting; 2) the acting; 3) the acting.I love movies. I love the history of movies. I love the great stars of movies. And of all I love about movies, I love ""sleepers"" or ""B-film classics"" the most. These are low budget films starring actors who were not top names, yet somehow what the camera captured is sheer magic. Example? Reaching way back, Jacques Toureau's 1947 film noir *Out of the Past* starring Robert Mitchum. It's a midnight cheapie. I could pick it apart piece by piece. But if you just shut up and WATCH what the camera saw the actors do, *Out of the Past* transports you out of this world. And despite its technical flaws, so does *Gia*--because of the magic of Angelina Jolie.In *Gia* there are about a half-dozen scenes performed by Ms Jolie that are so intense, I find them hard to watch unless I've emotionally prepared myself. I can't say positively that one stands out over the others. But if I were to pick a scene that I'm positive would transport any person who sat down to see *Gia* for the first time, I'd pick the last meeting between Gia and Linda, when Ms Jolie says to Elizabeth Mitchell, ""You were the one...the only one."" A scene like that--that's why movies were invented!*Gia* is not a documentary. It is hardly even a biopic. Angelina Jolie doesn't show us exactly what Gia Marie Carangi did at 6 PM on December 4th 1981. And then what she did at 3 AM on July 30, 1985. She shows us that Gia was blessed with an extraordinary gift, something exciting, brilliant, entrancing. Sometimes it's called star power. That gift is why Gia rose overnight out of nowhere to the top of the fashion model scene. Ms Jolie is able to show us that gift because she has it herself. It's in that sense that, yes, Angelina Jolie IS Gia, as the DVD boxcover proclaims.Gia didn't know how to handle her gift. Like the old story of Icarus, she rose on swift wings up to the sun only to have those wings destroyed by solar fire. As fast as she rose, she plummeted back to earth. *Gia* tells a frankly tragic story. But the closing scene--Gia walking away from the deathbed cloaked in folds of white, as if passing on to that next life she told T.J. about, the life in which God has a big plan for her--this scene represents the undying hope that makes a human being human.",5,Her performance is why movies were invented...,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,6056,"['review', 'unrated', 'DVD', 'edition', '*Gia*',

I think all young girls at one time or another wish they could be in a magazine. Most forget about it as they pursue real careers that would satisfy them. There were two lines in the movie that really struck me,one from the actor that played the famed photographer Frances Scuvullo,who states ""We use them up and throw them away""!And one from the main character Gia(Angelina Jolie) I go on go sees, I go,I go. but they don't see me aagh piece of meat. That was how she felt like a ""thing"".Gia should have had a parent with her. She was 17 years old when she entered the business. From the movie part Gia seemed to want her mother to stay with her and she couldn't or wouldn't, you don't really know. Also where were her friends when she began this spiral downward? Sad story about to much, too fast and no guidance.They may have called Cindy Crawford ""Baby Gia"" in the beginning, but had Gia the fortitude and knowledge that Cindy possessed (and Cindy Crawford was 20, still not as young as Gia was), but still young she might have been alright. Cindy Crawford has stated in numerous interviews that she is Cindy, ""Cindy Crawford is the ""thing"", the product. She knew this and worked it to her advantage.She recalls one event where a famous actor (she never states who ,darn)saw her on a magazine had his agent get her number for a date and when he went to pick her  up he was disappointed because she was just Cindy.What a horses behind this guy must have been LOL.

42987,A232JQR4NBH9SX,0783113943,Nikola,"[1, 2]","Welcome to the world of fashion, glamour and money. ""Gia"" is an HBO movie about the supermodel Gia Marie Carangi, starring Angelina Jolie in her first major role. It is an interesting movie about an interesting person, wonderfully directed, shot and acted-out, that you may wonder at times, is this really a TV movie?Gia was a beautiful young woman, who grew up wanting her face to grace covers of fashion magazines. She will succeed in this, however, her eccentric and wild life will make this story a tragic one. Angelina Jolie is perfect in this role. She achieves to be both a fighter and a vulnerable child and one could argue that she is not an actress, she is an embodiment of this superstar. She and the co-stars (especially Mercedes Ruehl, who plays Gia's mother with just the right dose of bitterness and love) make this movie very worth-watching, despite some of its flaws.

Very few holes are barred (as well as the gratuitous nudity the movie also includes reasonably explicit lesbian love scenes, intravenous drug use, and so forth) so probably not one for the kids. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the film for me is Gia's dysfunctional relationship with her mother (the movie hints that this was the driving force behind her self destructive behaviour).On the upside the characters are well drawn, particularly Jolie, her mother (who to the end remains in denial about her level of responsibility for her daughter's behaviour), and her confused girlfriend.

How big a star/model was Gia? Well, Cindy Crawford was dubbed the ""young Gia"" and the ""next Gia"" - that's how famous she was.Unfortunately, besides being the ""face"" of the day in the modelling world, she was also fairly famous for her drug addiction and ultimate fall from grace.If you want a more indepth depiction of Gia's life - there are a couple of books available. The best being ""Thing of Beauty: The Tragedy of Supermodel Gia"".Back to the film.Angelina Jolie BECOMES Gia in every sense of the word. Her performance is one of the best portrayals of real people in years. She is completely and utter believable. She captures what is surely the essense of Gia. She brings a desparate wanting to the character that you can feel.Elizabeth Mitchell ( recently of ""ER"" fame ) co-stars and really provides an excellent touch-stone for Gia's tortured existance.There's nothing pretty about this film - it shows the whole story, the drugs, the parties, the sex, the pain and the suffering. It depicts, with little filter, the USING of Gia and her decent into her fate.It's no surprise that Angelina won a Golden Globe for this amazing performance. It's no surprise that she was nominated for an Emmy either. You're not able to take your eyes off her. As a matter of fact, this is a much awarded film - including a best actress award for Angelina Jolie at the LA Outfest.Faye Dunaway is mainly here for star power - almost as if they weren't sure Angelina Jolie could pull it off. She's okay here, but we all know that Faye has done some amazing work and here, she sort of phones it in.Mercedes Ruehl plays Gia's mother and she does a good job. She's a little over the top but you suspect it's an accurate portrayal.For the Angelina Jolie fan - it's a MUST SEE, MUST OWN film. For others, it really is worth the time and money.You don't often get a chance to see a young star make an amazing film like this. You'll see small tales of ""Lisa"" from her Academy Award winning performance in ""Girl, Interupted"" in Gia, but mostly you'll see an INCREDIBLE performance by Angelina Jolie.

43020,A2BDQQ39DJ826Y,0783113943,viewer,"[3, 8]","This film draws on an extreme true-life story that seems sure to make a person feel and think.  In 1979, a rough, wild, pretty 19-year-old from a broken home leaves Philadelphia, where she works behind the counter at her father's Italian diner and hangs out in seedy nightclubs, for New York City.  She becomes a phenomenal success almost overnight as an elite, new-wave, jet-set fashion model with ""attitude.""  She parties on the wild side, has a close, on-and-off lesbian relationship with a makeup artist, suddenly loses her agent/mentor to cancer, and heavily abuses harder and harder drugs, frequenting ""needle parks.""  Quickly, she burns out her body, relationships, and career.  Reduced to trading sex for money, she is beaten up and raped.  She is arrested for reckless driving and resisting arrest.  She tries to make a career come-back and to go home.  She sells jeans in a local shop.  After repeated tries at rehabilitation, she either relapses or attempts a massive overdose.  In seclusion in a hospital indigent ward, she dies in 1986 at 26 of the newly discovered AIDS.Angelina Jolie gives a raw, emotional performance, combining child-like and hard qualities. The generally well-acted main supporting characters are thin (especially the idealized, ""sweetness and light"" Elizabeth Mitchell character), at times hammy (Mercedes Ruehl), but have some basic believability and traits that play into the drama (Faye Dunaway, Ruehl coddling and pushing; Ruehl and Mitchell withdrawing for various reasons; Eric Cole as a decent but dim hometown pal). There are glimmers of poignancy in some interactions and details of the experiences. Probably the film's most effective moments are the model's relationship with the makeup artist and destructive drug use (dominating the last half). The movie conveys (partly by fictionalizing and tightly limiting its snapshots of her life) a sense of frenzy, loneliness, and emptiness -- life in a dead zone.Yet, the movie is startlingly unsatisfying on any but the most basic emotional level of watching the vivid, photogenic Jolie act out the fateful events, with flashes of striking visuals in recreated settings and with perhaps the invitation to viewers to project onto the screen whatever trite, preconceived notions they might want to see about emotional problems, exploitation, or addiction. The film seems to lack any point of view.  It narrates through sketchy, spotty vignettes rather than thoughtfully examines.  The movie lacks detail, context, depth, substance, and insight, the characters and events little more than a blur. It barely scratches the surface, if that, of what were her ""demons,"" how and why they came about, what was special about them, why they hit her so hard, and why drug abuse was her answer.  (Regarding technique, scenes shift arbitrarily from color to black-and-white and back again, sometimes accented by heavy-handed music; they alternate with awkward, glib documentary-style ""interviews""; and the long, distinctive chain-link-fence photo shoot and shower scenes, intended to be candid and uninhibited, are hampered by the staginess of the apparent effort to avoid full frontal nudity, even in the extended, uncut version.)Consistent with statements in the film that ""No one knew Gia"" (including her), its treatment of her background, emotional problems, promiscuity (among a flurry of quick, slick throwaway lines at the start we are told, but never shown, that she ""slept around"" but sex ""was not the goal,"" ""was not an issue""), overall relationships, lesbianism, drug addiction, and (strangely and especially) her modeling talent, career, and world (""America's first supermodel"") is vague, minimalist, and simplistic. Particularly weak or artificial are the statements mouthed by actors playing her contemporaries in the retrospectives; by the Italian photographer who spouts drivel as pious philosophy (""This is life....""); by the scornful, speechifying woman in the stilted, scripted rehab scene; and most disappointingly by the model herself and her ""journal"" (presented as poetic gems of meaning but falling far short of any such thing, even the message she wanted to send from her deathbed oddly off and easy, given her experiences: ""she wanted to tell kids, you can handle it, you can handle anything that comes your way""). The movie does painfully little to delve beneath surface notions and manifestations and to illuminate any real understanding of this woman's situation, even less why she was a human being worthy of all of this special attention.As a result, those reviews that claim to find profound meaning in this film are left to string together fuzzy, lofty-sounding cliches and platitudes (""tragic"" ""lost soul"" or ""free spirit"" who ""lived in the moment"" and ""followed her instincts,"" ""did not allow herself to be loved,"" ""did not know what 'true love' was,"" with ""so much 'artificial love' surrounding her""; ""too beautiful to die, too wild to live""; ""take nothing for granted,"" ""strive for your dreams and follow your heart,"" ""you can never love or forgive your children enough,"" ""money does not make a person happy,"" ""we all want mainly to be loved and accepted"") and to coast on the extreme, sensationalistic events of the model's life.  Some make vast pretensions for the movie (that it itself does not make, much less deliver on), building up a heroine or martyr and sketching a morality play that blames everyone and everything else for what happened to her, while asking no hard questions about her own willful qualities and responsibility for her own behavior.  The claims of deep meaning come across as shallow glorification of physical beauty, of tempestuousness, or of a glamorous, sensuous image for their own sake or as sheer sentimentality for a supposedly pathetic, helpless victim.Ironically, all of the mindless emoting, adulation, even idolatry by those claiming to know, admire, or adore this woman through this essentially superficial movie -- just as surely as her supposed exploitation in her chosen career -- risks again reducing her, now in death, to a flat, one-dimensional, token figure being grabbed at by the masses (as fallen physical beauty, force of nature, glossy image, or victim).  And if that does not diminish her as a whole human being, it may merely lavish undeserved attention and acclaim on a person of little or no substance (mired in what is presented as near-total confusion about who she was, what she wanted, and what she cared about, combined with non-stop destructive, thrill-seeking, instant-gratification behavior).
