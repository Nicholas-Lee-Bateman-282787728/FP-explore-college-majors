1693346,A385SBEEJ15HHJ,B00I3KU0R2,Cindy Navarro,"[8, 8]","An interesting modern twist on an old story. The action is set during a time when Christians, known as followers of The Way, are once again being hunted and persecuted. However, it also closely follows the Biblical account of Paul as told in the book of Acts. Since I am familiar with that story I followed the plot through that perspective. I admit that I am curious to know how this story would be viewed from someone who does not know about Saul of Tarsus/Paul.In this telling, many of the names remain the same from Biblical accounts, but Paul's god is the government and he is their best agent. While many seek to incarcerate Way People, Paul will ruthlessly terminate any who fail to comply. Yet when he is blinded and is nursed back to help by those he once persecuted, he reaches out to the One they follow. The transformation from killer to protector of God's people is a clear demonstration of the forgiveness and new beginning offered to those who choose to repent.I enjoyed the fresh look at a story I have known most of my life. The historical accuracy was preserved enough to recognize, yet the futurist look to the film gave one a greater grasp on the possibility that Christians may once again be persecuted for their faith, even in areas that proclaim religious freedom. It was understandably dark in many ways, but the viewer is still left with hope. There were comic touches sprinkled through the story, but the ability to laugh through fear and tragedy is in our nature. The soundtrack was excellent! Jurgen Beck (who is also one of the producers) is one of my favorite composers, and his music was the perfect touch for the film. There is no profanity, nudity, or graphic images, but some of the scenes are too intense for children, so 12+ should be okay to watch.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this product from Edify Media at no cost to me for the purpose of writing a review.

1693347,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00I3KU0R2,Lee Armstrong,"[5, 5]","""My Name Is Paul"" is a strong Christian film.  The strongest piece of this ensemble cast is the lead Andrew Roth who plays Paul and carries the film with his minimal, passionate performance.  The transition from Christian executioner of the followers of ""The Way"" to converted follower of the religious group with strong faith in God is as believable as it is breathtaking.  I see he is also announced to star in the ""I Am Paul II"" sequel.  Vanessa Ore is an excellent actress who fills the screen with believable anxiety and worry of a mother whose family is endangered by their beliefs.  One of the best supporting performances is the passionate performance of Tim Ross as Annan, the physician healer of the group.  The scene where he has to try to explain to a doubting Priscilla why he has helped the known assassin, rips your heart out and also delivers one of the strongest moral lessons of the film that the gospel compels us to love even our enemies.  While I was a tad confused by the character Barney's part in the story, actor Torrey Martin with his bright red hair and great comic timing punctuates the film with some finely timed comic relief.  Joe Coffey's role as Ben goes a bit over the top for me as a crazy psycho, but I admit he's very interesting to watch.  Other strong performances are given by Cranston Johnson as Kain as the policeman who follows Paul as he changes to a man of faith, Abigale Rose Cornell as the lovely child Claire who smiles despite missing her older brother, David Sweeney as the geezer Myron who rescues Paul from the side of the road, Catherine Trail as Myron's wife (I assume) Myra and Elijah Chester's soulful cameo as Peter.Two things I should note.  First, I am glad that I read the other reviews before writing because I was not as attuned to the life of Paul.  Also, Paul is not my favorite Christian hero.  I attribute to him the diverting of the gospel of Jesus from His teachings to a religion more about Jesus, emphasizing the death of the risen Christ.  Secondly, while I am in no way personally associated with the film, I am also an actor and have worked with or personally know about seven of the actors in addition to the director/producer.  That noted, I do recommend this film.  Costumed like a post-apocalyptic Matrix, the stark dreary look of ""The Way"" camp counterpoints the high government officials in a sinister red & black visual setting.  As the film rolled along, I got more and more into it, until about two-thirds of the way through I was utterly riveted.  Seek & you shall find!

1693348,A3K6XA6UH9YUO9,B00I3KU0R2,Noelle the Dreamer,"[1, 1]","Saul of Tarsus is perhaps best known to Christians as Paul the Apostle and the movie is an analogy of the man known for his hate and persecutions of Christians.Science fiction and apocalyptic prophecies are not my cup of tea. So in tune is my family, each groaned when I first mentioned the movie knowing I detest the genre.But as they say, never judge a book (movie) by its cover...In his younger days, Saul was involved in persecuting Jewish followers of Jesus because he believed they were heretics (Acts 22:4-5).Saul was traveling to the city of Damascus when he saw a bright light and heard Jesus' voice saying &#34;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?&#34; He fell from his horse, blinded. Days later, after a visit from the Christian disciple Ananias, he recovered his eyesight and began to preach Jesus' gospel. (Acts 9, 22 and 26).My Name Is Paul features a movie adaptation surprisingly closer to the original story than I anticipated.I believe the director did his utmost to follow the biblical story and even used the names as read in the Bible. The actors however are unfortunately lagging behind his efforts at the detriment of the overhaul quality of the movie.Some violence is to be noted, including use of weapons and therefore suggests an audience 12 years and older, best for youth groups and church gatherings according to my family (I have not changed my mind about the genre Folks!)That said, the movie will appeal to those fond of a future connotative with the grim outlook of post apocalypse and is well worth the message: Once converted, Paul committed himself to his new found beliefs whatever the outcome.3 Stars!Disclaimer: I received a copy of each DVD courtesy of EDIFY MEDIA Inc. as part of the movie's promotion.

1693349,A8N3FYDA2VUYY,B00I3KU0R2,"Pirate2240 ""Kat""","[1, 2]","I am always looking for exceptional family movies that have a message and is something appropriate for my family to gather around and watch together. In most cases I have found those movies come from Word Films and when I received an offer to review their latest movie, My Name is Paul, I was more than excited!The premise is a futuristic version of the retelling of the story of Paul from the Bible, the Christian killer. In this case, Paul is part of a police force to eliminate followers of Christ called the Way from spreading their religion across the city. He is known for capturing and in most cases bringing those cases to trial and even filling the victims without forethought. He believes its simply part of his job and one that his superiors recognize and promote him for.Now he is on the hunt for their leader, a man named Stephen, who refuses to go into hiding even though the Way followers believe he should especially in light of Paul's recent promotions to find the leaders and bring their to justice. Only just like the Bible version, Paul is confronted through a terrible accident that completely leaves him blind and searching for the real truth and one that will drastically change the life he had been living.I received My Name is Paul compliments of Edify Media Inc and Word Films for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions in this review are strictly my own. This unfortunately for me was not one of my favorites. I felt it was too poorly made and the characters weren't believable enough to make you care about them enough to want to finish the movie at 100 minutes in length. It simply lacked the passion to make this one work in my opinion and I felt that the story needed more depth to it to make it work for a modern day audience. The message is clear but my family didn't care for it at all. My daughter at 15 left within the first 10 minutes of the beginning of the movie.In my opinion, I would give this one a 3 out of 5 stars.

It tells the Bible story of Paul, but in the present/future kind of setting.All of the people&#8217;s names are the same as the Bible and the Christians are called The Way and the ones against them and anything to do with the Bible are called The World.My Name is Paul is a very action-packed, suspenseful DVD.  It shows how Christians were persecuted, are and will be again to a very big way. The first few scenes shows Paul chasing down Christians and killing them and how Paul is recognized as a great leader.The Paul is in a car accident and loses his sight and gets lost. The members of The Way pick him up take him to their hospital and then the action really starts.I was really excited to get and review this DVD.
