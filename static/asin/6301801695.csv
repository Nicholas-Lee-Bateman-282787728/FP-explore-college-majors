Sad to say, it's a film that I never saw but only to retain the knowledge of the title as a derisive label for the particular group. I finally got the chance to see it as a premiere on TCM recently. To my surprise, I found Fatso an entertaining picture which I classified as a nice slice of real life story. Dom Deluise was perfect for the role although I honestly never saw him as a fatso or even close to being fat. Just a bit of exercise, and he would have looked pretty good slimmed down. It's the supporting cast that made the film workable. One best performance out of the bunch was Ron Carey as Dominick's little brother. Anne Bancroft was a bit too much for me. Sad to say, Dom, Ron, and Anne had long passed away. Candice Azzara, who played Lydia, provided a nice sparkplug to provide the film a subplot to give the film another dimension.

269093,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6301801695,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","FATSO (Writ./Prod./Dir. Anne Bancroft, 1980, 93 minutes) is a film I have loved since it was first released--and I love the late Anne Bancroft because she reminded me so much of my mother. This film, starring Dom DeLuise, was written and directed by Bancroft and it is sadly, unjustly forgotten.I was ruminating about Anne Bancroft, her husband Mel Brooks and how they started, how they became famous. It is interesting to note Anne Bancroft really first hit the public eye as a movie star, while Brooks was still a back-room TV sitcom writer. This led me to think about FATSO and how it invariably makes us all collapse with laughter whenever we see it.Dom plays Dominic DiNapoli (credited as ""Dominick"" and by the way DiNapoli was Bancroft's mother's maiden surname), a fun-loving, gentle Italian giant who loves to eat. He struggles with his weight and general unattractive qualities a laMarty--that is until he meets the woman of his dreams, Lydia (a hilarious Candice Azzara). The beauty is Lydia is half-Italian and Catholic...Dom couldn't have dreamed a better woman. Anne Bancroft has a lengthy cameo as Dom's harpy of a sister, Antoinette.This incredibly ahead-of-its-time comedy focuses on everything from sadness and cultural isolation to the weight-loss movement and sad loss of self-worth...and these are most definitely even more cogent now than they were in 1980. Bancroft and Mel Brooks always had a nose for the things that matter. As you enjoy the rich, emotional comedy of this great family film, do not forget that it clearly depicts real problems we face today.Dom's entanglement with a weight-loss program results in one of the most hysterical comedic sequences ever filmed. That good old 1970s TV bit player Ron Carey plays Dom's brother Frankie--their exchanges and witty dialogue proved Bancroft was every bit the equal of Oscar Wilde and even Jane Austen. So no, you cannot claim to be a film buff or true comedy fan if you have missed this film.Like Dom and his Chinese food, you'll find you cannot live without it. Best of all, it has a happy ending with a powerful message that I think everyone needs to learn.WARNING: Be alert, because at these prices I'm not really certain what you're getting. A new trade-in will net you $25 on a gift card, yet I saw a copy of this DVD for sale here for around $100. The present low price of $50 is the LOWEST on offer which probably means it is a used DVD--I'm not sure, but one thing of which I am certain is it shames me to see how greedy people are.",5,"Anne Bancroft's writing/directing tour-de-force, one of the greatest comedies ever made",1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,2520,"['FATSO', 'Writ./Prod./Dir', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', '1980', '93', 'minutes', 'film', 'have', 'loved', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'love', 'late', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'reminded', 'so', 'much', 'mother', 'film', 'starring', 'Dom', 'DeLuise', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Bancroft', 'sadly', 'unjustly', 'forgotten.I', 'was', 'ruminating', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'husband', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'how', 'started', 'how', 'became', 'famous', 'interesting', 'note', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'really', 'first', 'hit', 'public', 'eye', 'movie', 'star', 'Brooks', 'was', 'still', 'back-room', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'writer', 'led', 'think', 'FATSO', 'how', 'invariably', 'collapse', 'laughter', 'whenever', 'see', 'it.Dom', 'plays', 'Dominic', 'DiNapoli', 'credited', 'Dominick', 'way', 'DiNapoli', 'was', 'Bancroft', 'mother', 'maiden', 'surname', 'fun-loving', 'gentle', 'Italian', 'giant', 'who', 'eat', 'weight', 'general', 'unattractive', 'qualities', 'laMarty', 'woman', 'dreams', 'Lydia', 'hilarious', 'Candice', 'Azzara', 'beauty', 'Lydia', 'half-Italian', 'Catholic', 'Dom', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'dreamed', 'better', 'woman', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'lengthy', 'cameo', 'Dom', 'harpy', 'sister', 'Antoinette.This', 'incredibly', 'ahead-of-its-time', 'comedy', 'focuses', 'everything', 'sadness', 'cultural', 'isolation', 'weight-loss', 'movement', 'sad', 'loss', 'self-worth', 'are', 'most', 'definitely', 'even', 'more', 'cogent', 'now', 'were', '1980', 'Bancroft', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'always', 'had', 'nose', 'things', 'matter', 'enjoy', 'rich', 'emotional', 'comedy', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'forget', 'clearly', 'real', 'problems', 'face', 'entanglement', 'weight-loss', 'program', 'results', 'one', 'most', 'hysterical', 'comedic', 'sequences', 'ever', 'filmed', 'good', 'old', '1970s', 'TV', 'bit', 'player', 'Ron', 'Carey', 'Dom', 'brother', 'Frankie', 'exchanges', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'proved', 'Bancroft', 'was', 'bit', 'equal', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'even', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'So', 'no', 'can', 'not', 'claim', 'be', 'film', 'buff', 'true', 'comedy', 'fan', 'have', 'missed', 'film.Like', 'Dom', 'Chinese', 'food', ""'ll"", 'find', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'Best', 'happy', 'ending', 'powerful', 'message', 'think', 'everyone', 'needs', 'learn.WARNING', 'Be', 'alert', 'prices', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'certain', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'new', 'trade-in', 'will', 'net', '25', 'gift', 'card', 'saw', 'copy', 'DVD', 'sale', 'here', '100', 'present', 'low', 'price', '50', 'LOWEST', 'offer', 'probably', 'used', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'thing', 'am', 'certain', 'see', 'how', 'greedy', 'people', 'are']",N/A

What I mean is that when you watch this movie, you experience the many ways that Italians live, love, interact with family, and take part in the world.  There are so many parallels to real Italians it's uncanny.  Some examples:- The opening funeral scene with Dom's cousin Salvatore (just the names are enough!!)- The way in which food is used to calm down Dom as a young boy, and how he uses it to calm himself down as an adult- The family's life in New York- The relationship between Dom, his brother Frankie, and his sister AntoinetteThe movie is funny, sad, heartwarming, and so many other emotions.  The performances are outstanding.  First, there's the late great Dom Deluise playing a character which is, essentially, himself.  He is so realistic you feel you are truly watching Dominic DiNapoli and not the actor who is portraying him.  Then there's Ron Carey, who plays Dom's younger brother Frankie.  Carey does such a good job that you really think the two are brothers in real life.  Finally, there's the acting genius of the late Anne Bancroft.  She plays sister Antoinette to a 'T' in so many ways.  I especially was touched by how she showed both anger and love towards her brother and how her ranting and raving are such a memorable part of the movie.Besides the 'Italian angle', there are so many other great things in this movie, including the Chubby Checkers (hysterical), 'get the honey junior', the 'candle snuffer outer', and the romance between Dom and Lydia.  It just goes on and on!This is such a great movie in so many ways, you have to see it.  It may have not made too much of a splash when it was out, but it's surely one of the best, most realistic movies ever.

""Fatso"" is the closest a movie has ever gotten to what the urban Italian-American is like. I don't think a lot of folks will get the humor-it's of a very special brand.

269096,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,6301801695,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[6, 9]","This is a little treasure trove of a film. Superb actress, Anne Bancroft (aka Anna Maria Louise Italiano), only wrote one screenplay and only directed one movie -and this was it. She worked through her husband's production company (Brookfilms), and put together a precious commodity for the ages. It is a shame she never directed again. She had a terrific comic ear for dialogue, cast well, and must have done the project as a labor of love; perhaps too much so.. Her work was reminiscent of the writing and directing of Elaine May. But possibly the stress of being the matriarch and Madre for a giggling gaggle of comedic actors, and the go-to gal for everyone else did not turn out to be much ""fun"".She seemed to have a very slim budget to work with. She cast herself in the film, and did a wonderful acting job as the hysterically domineering sister, Anoinette. She ended up with a crew of mostly television veterans, and the result was the finished film looked like it was created ""on the cheap"". The rather pedestrian cinematography was done by TV veteran Brianne Murphy. The unremarkable musical score was composed by Joe Penzetti, a ""B"" film, and TV veteran. The strength of this film was in the writing and the acting--and of course the directing.Dom DeLuise played Dominick DiNapoli, a 40ish overweight bachelor, still living at home, a gourmet cook, and a champion calorie consumer. This was one of Dom's best roles, although admittedly it was not much of a stretch for him. His sensitive nature and his ability to weep on cue gave the character depth. Ron Carey played his brother, Frankie, and he gave it just the right blend of bathos, chaos, and burlesque. Candice Azzara played the lovely Lydia, Dom's love interest. Her Lydia was shy, lonely, struggling to be independent, very religious, creative, fussy, oddly realistic, idealistic, nave -and when asked if she still was a virgin, she replied, ""Nearly."" She reminded me some of Carol Kane with her nuanced and well thought out performance.There are those folks who might feel that this movie is lightweight, not on a par with Carl Reiner's manic WHERE'S PAPA? (1970), or Mel Brooks side-splitting THE PRODUCERS (1968), nor did it have the sweet sarcasm of A THOUSAND CLOWNS (1965). So as a New York based comedy it was overshadowed by the bigger box office and critical hits. Yet this gentle and touching film represents the genuine warmth and sentiment that was missing from the darker and more profane comedies. For Dom DeLuise fans, it is a must-see. For the rest of us it is a great time at the Bijou.",3,"To Eat, or Not to Eat",1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,2573,"['little', 'treasure', 'trove', 'film', 'Superb', 'actress', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'aka', 'Anna', 'Maria', 'Louise', 'Italiano', 'only', 'wrote', 'one', 'screenplay', 'only', 'directed', 'one', 'movie', '-and', 'was', 'worked', 'husband', 'production', 'company', 'Brookfilms', 'put', 'together', 'precious', 'commodity', 'ages', 'shame', 'never', 'directed', 'again', 'had', 'terrific', 'comic', 'ear', 'dialogue', 'cast', 'well', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'project', 'labor', 'love', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'so..', 'Her', 'work', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'writing', 'directing', 'Elaine', 'May', 'possibly', 'stress', 'being', 'matriarch', 'Madre', 'giggling', 'gaggle', 'comedic', 'actors', 'go-to', 'gal', 'everyone', 'else', 'did', 'not', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'fun', '.She', 'seemed', 'have', 'very', 'slim', 'budget', 'work', 'cast', 'film', 'did', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'job', 'hysterically', 'domineering', 'sister', 'Anoinette', 'ended', 'up', 'crew', 'mostly', 'television', 'veterans', 'result', 'was', 'finished', 'film', 'looked', 'was', 'created', 'cheap', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'cinematography', 'was', 'done', 'TV', 'veteran', 'Brianne', 'Murphy', 'unremarkable', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'composed', 'Joe', 'Penzetti', 'B', 'film', 'TV', 'veteran', 'strength', 'film', 'was', 'writing', 'acting', 'course', 'directing.Dom', 'DeLuise', 'played', 'Dominick', 'DiNapoli', '40ish', 'overweight', 'bachelor', 'still', 'living', 'home', 'gourmet', 'cook', 'champion', 'calorie', 'consumer', 'was', 'one', 'Dom', 'best', 'roles', 'admittedly', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'stretch', 'sensitive', 'nature', 'ability', 'weep', 'cue', 'gave', 'character', 'depth', 'Ron', 'Carey', 'played', 'brother', 'Frankie', 'gave', 'just', 'right', 'blend', 'bathos', 'chaos', 'burlesque', 'Candice', 'Azzara', 'played', 'lovely', 'Lydia', 'Dom', 'love', 'interest', 'Lydia', 'was', 'shy', 'lonely', 'struggling', 'be', 'independent', 'very', 'religious', 'creative', 'fussy', 'oddly', 'realistic', 'idealistic', 'nave', '-and', 'when', 'asked', 'still', 'was', 'virgin', 'replied', 'Nearly', 'reminded', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'nuanced', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'performance.There', 'are', 'folks', 'who', 'might', 'feel', 'movie', 'lightweight', 'not', 'par', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'manic', 'WHERE', 'PAPA', '1970', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'side-splitting', 'THE', 'PRODUCERS', '1968', 'did', 'have', 'sweet', 'sarcasm', 'A', 'THOUSAND', 'CLOWNS', '1965', 'So', 'New', 'York', 'based', 'comedy', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'bigger', 'box', 'office', 'critical', 'hits', 'gentle', 'touching', 'film', 'genuine', 'warmth', 'sentiment', 'was', 'missing', 'darker', 'more', 'profane', 'comedies', 'Dom', 'DeLuise', 'fans', 'must-see', 'rest', 'great', 'time', 'Bijou']",N/A

From the close knit family ties to the pot of simmering gravy on the stove, it never hits a false note. The film is far more than a superficial comedy with equal amounts of drama and romance. Dom De Luise is perfect as a middle aged man who has been raised to use food as a comforting tool to ease his aching heart in times of sorrow.The film sports a great cast and some very funny scenes (i.e.. the fight between Dom and his brother with a kitchen knife is pure gold!), but has equally tender moments when Dom falls in love and he starts to lose weight without trying. I think the film also shows the absurdity of diets if not handled in a way that the dieter can live with over time. You can't take off a life time worth of fat in a short period of time and you will never keep it off if you don't allow yourself to eat the foods you love.This is a classic film that really hasn't be given it's due.

He is a wonderful guy, outgoing, charming, warm,fat, who adores food. The scene in which he is  being told by the dietician the many, many items that he cannot eat has me  still laughing -- the tragic look on the poor fellow's face becomes sadder  and sadder as she rattles off the long list of delicious, but forbidden  delicacies. When Dom goes beserk in the night and threatens his baby  brother with a knife to get the key to the food cabinet, the brother calls  his dieters group &quot;Chubby Checkers&quot; for help. These two enormous  checkers rush over and proceed to talk about food, the things they love:  &quot;have you ever sucked out the jelly in a jelly donut and filled it  with chocolate chip ice cream?&quot; Needless to say, what follows is a  riot, both of food and comedy.Highly recommended if you have a warm  heart and maybe a less than perfect body.",5,Heartwarming gem,950745600,"02 17, 2000",2000,992,"['can', 'disregard', 'Maltin', 'one', 'film', 'true', 'modern', 'classic', 'man', 'temptation', 'food', 'wonderful', 'guy', 'outgoing', 'charming', 'warm', 'fat', 'who', 'food', 'scene', 'being', 'told', 'dietician', 'many', 'many', 'items', 'can', 'not', 'eat', 'still', 'laughing', 'tragic', 'look', 'poor', 'fellow', 'face', 'sadder', 'sadder', 'long', 'list', 'delicious', 'forbidden', 'delicacies', 'When', 'Dom', 'beserk', 'night', 'baby', 'brother', 'knife', 'get', 'key', 'food', 'cabinet', 'brother', 'dieters', 'group', 'quot', 'Chubby', 'Checkers', 'quot', 'help', 'two', 'enormous', 'checkers', 'rush', 'proceed', 'talk', 'food', 'things', 'love', 'quot', 'have', 'ever', 'sucked', 'out', 'jelly', 'jelly', 'donut', 'filled', 'chocolate', 'chip', 'ice', 'cream', 'quot', 'Needless', 'say', 'what', 'riot', 'food', 'comedy.Highly', 'recommended', 'have', 'warm', 'heart', 'maybe', 'less', 'perfect', 'body']",N/A
