What I love about Rohmer's films is the delicacy and the subtleness in them.""My Night At Maud's"" was the third film in Rohmer's ""Six Moral Tales"". And many see it not only as the best of the six, but, also as Rohmer's best film. And, they have a good case to give it that credit.To those who are unaware of the story it goes something like this, and I'll try not to reveal any major plot-points.A young man, Jean-Louis (Jean-Louis Trintignant) is searching for the perfect mate. A woman who must share his religious beliefs, which are catholic, and his views of love. He has set quite a high standard for himself, considering it's the ""modern world"". Where religion doesn't really play a big part in most people lives or at least in the women whom he meets. That is until he meets a beautiful blond,Francoise (Marie-Christine Barrault) in of all places, church! He soon finds himself, along with a friend, Vidal (Antoine Vitez) spending the night at Maud's. A ""modern"" woman with ""modern"" views. These two seem to be as different as they come. She is not really what he's looking for and he is too ""old-fashion"" for her.What happens afterwards is truly priceless. As Rohmer has made a film that is about as funny as a film could be dealing with sexual morals. It also has some of the ""smartest"" dialogue I've ever heard. If you've never seen a Rohmer film, this is a wonderful place to start. One of the best French films of all-time and one of the true ""classics"" in cinema.""My Night At Maud's"" was nominated for two Oscars; ""Best Foreign Film"" and ""Best Screenplay"". It was also hailed as the best film of the year in 1970 by the late Gene Siskel.",5,My Night With Rohmer,1017446400,"03 30, 2002",2002,1756,"['are', 'few', 'filmmakers', 'whom', 'can', 'say', 'truly', 'put', 'good', 'mood', 'Rohmer', 'one', 'filmmakers', 'What', 'love', 'Rohmer', 'films', 'delicacy', 'subtleness', 'Night', 'Maud', 'was', 'third', 'film', 'Rohmer', 'Six', 'Moral', 'Tales', 'many', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'six', 'also', 'Rohmer', 'best', 'film', 'have', 'good', 'case', 'give', 'who', 'are', 'unaware', 'story', 'something', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'reveal', 'major', 'plot-points.A', 'young', 'man', 'Jean-Louis', 'Jean-Louis', 'Trintignant', 'searching', 'perfect', 'mate', 'A', 'woman', 'who', 'must', 'share', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'are', 'catholic', 'views', 'love', 'set', 'quite', 'high', 'standard', 'considering', 'modern', 'world', 'Where', 'religion', ""n't"", 'really', 'play', 'big', 'part', 'most', 'people', 'least', 'women', 'whom', 'beautiful', 'blond', 'Francoise', 'Marie-Christine', 'Barrault', 'places', 'church', 'soon', 'friend', 'Vidal', 'Antoine', 'Vitez', 'spending', 'night', 'Maud', 'modern', 'woman', 'modern', 'views', 'two', 'seem', 'be', 'as', 'different', 'come', 'not', 'really', 'what', 'looking', 'too', 'old-fashion', 'her.What', 'afterwards', 'truly', 'priceless', 'Rohmer', 'made', 'film', 'as', 'funny', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'dealing', 'sexual', 'morals', 'also', 'smartest', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Rohmer', 'film', 'wonderful', 'place', 'start', 'One', 'best', 'French', 'films', 'all-time', 'one', 'true', 'classics', 'cinema', 'Night', 'Maud', 'was', 'nominated', 'two', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'was', 'also', 'hailed', 'best', 'film', 'year', '1970', 'late', 'Gene', 'Siskel']",My Night At Maud's

But when late in life he becomes a convert to Catholicism, he decides to turn his back on his past and settle down to married life with a nice Catholic girl - preferably a blond. He finds Francoise (Marie-Christine Barrault), the perfect candidate, in a  Catholic church - where else? -  pursues her and makes a date, but before he can keep the date he meets Vidal (Antoine Vitez ), an old school friend who he hasn't seen for fourteen years. Vidal  takes him to the home of Maud, a highly intelligent and lovely to look at young woman. For several hours they have  a lively conversation about the philosophy of Pascal and freedom of choice - which is ironic in view of what happens later -  until Vidal leaves. After which the conversation becomes more intimate and confiding as they build up a strong rapport. Surely you think he cannot still be intending to keep his date with the blond, when he has  this new so  much more promising relationship developing. But there is only one problem; she is not a Catholic. She tries to seduce him and though she manages to persuade him to stay the night he refuses to get into bed with her preferring to lie on the top of the bed wrapped in a blanket - with her lying naked under the bed clothes alongside him. This takes  some suspension of disbelief from the viewer. Towards morning she makes a more overt attempt to seduce him but again fails - his newly found Catholic conscience will not allow him to succumb.Being a Catholic, you see, now debars him from doing what he has done so often in his previous life; sleeping with a woman outside marriage. And so because he allows himself to be governed by these new strictures, he loses his ideal woman, the intellectual equal who would have made him happy, and goes off to keep his date and marry the blond.Though he may have seemed to choose the blond in preference to Maude, in reality he made no such choice; his choice was determined for him by the strictures of the Catholic Church. If he had met Maude a year earlier, before his conversion to Catholicism, he would have been able to make a free unrestricted choice and would no doubt have chosen Maude.It emerges that the blond was Maude's ex-husband's mistress  - a piece of information introduced presumably to show that she is not the devout, pure -minded virgin he originally assumed her to be.He meets Maude one last time five years later on the sand dunes at some sea side resort - he with his wife and child, she alone. They talk in a desultory way; she tells him that she is unhappily married again and asks why he never phoned her as he had promised, and then she walks out of his life for ever.This I think is the best of Eric Rohmer's Six Moral Tales, if only because the usual long conversations have more substance.",5,another moral dilemma.,1009497600,"12 28, 2001",2001,2871,"['Louis', 'Jean-Louis', 'Trintigant', 'philandering', 'intellectual', 'several', 'affairs', 'when', 'late', 'life', 'convert', 'Catholicism', 'turn', 'back', 'past', 'settle', 'down', 'married', 'life', 'nice', 'Catholic', 'girl', 'preferably', 'blond', 'Francoise', 'Marie-Christine', 'Barrault', 'perfect', 'candidate', 'Catholic', 'church', 'where', 'else', 'date', 'can', 'keep', 'date', 'Vidal', 'Antoine', 'Vitez', 'old', 'school', 'friend', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'fourteen', 'years', 'Vidal', 'home', 'Maud', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'lovely', 'look', 'young', 'woman', 'several', 'hours', 'have', 'lively', 'conversation', 'philosophy', 'Pascal', 'freedom', 'choice', 'ironic', 'view', 'what', 'later', 'Vidal', 'conversation', 'more', 'intimate', 'confiding', 'build', 'up', 'strong', 'rapport', 'Surely', 'think', 'can', 'not', 'still', 'be', 'intending', 'keep', 'date', 'blond', 'when', 'new', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'promising', 'relationship', 'developing', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'not', 'Catholic', 'seduce', 'persuade', 'stay', 'night', 'get', 'bed', 'preferring', 'lie', 'top', 'bed', 'wrapped', 'blanket', 'lying', 'naked', 'bed', 'clothes', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'viewer', 'morning', 'more', 'overt', 'attempt', 'seduce', 'again', 'newly', 'found', 'Catholic', 'conscience', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'succumb.Being', 'Catholic', 'see', 'now', 'doing', 'what', 'done', 'so', 'often', 'previous', 'life', 'sleeping', 'woman', 'outside', 'marriage', 'so', 'be', 'governed', 'new', 'strictures', 'ideal', 'woman', 'intellectual', 'equal', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'happy', 'off', 'keep', 'date', 'marry', 'blond.Though', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'choose', 'blond', 'preference', 'Maude', 'reality', 'made', 'such', 'choice', 'choice', 'was', 'determined', 'strictures', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'had', 'met', 'Maude', 'year', 'earlier', 'conversion', 'Catholicism', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'make', 'free', 'unrestricted', 'choice', 'would', 'no', 'doubt', 'have', 'chosen', 'Maude.It', 'blond', 'was', 'Maude', 'ex-husband', 'mistress', 'piece', 'information', 'introduced', 'presumably', 'show', 'not', 'devout', 'pure', '-minded', 'virgin', 'originally', 'assumed', 'be.He', 'meets', 'Maude', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'sand', 'dunes', 'sea', 'side', 'resort', 'wife', 'child', 'alone', 'talk', 'desultory', 'way', 'unhappily', 'married', 'again', 'why', 'never', 'phoned', 'had', 'promised', 'then', 'life', 'ever.This', 'think', 'best', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'Six', 'Moral', 'Tales', 'only', 'usual', 'long', 'conversations', 'have', 'more', 'substance']",My Night At Maud's

I would lie if I'd say MY NIGHT AT MAUD'S is an action movie. It's not a boring arty work either. Eric Rohmer is a very  peculiar case among french directors. He's interested in morals, in the  deep psychology of his movies' characters, in literature and philosophical  problems. Vast program, rich but not rebarbative at all.MY NIGHT AT  MAUD'S is the third of the six moral tales he shot in the sixties and early  seventies. The action takes place in Clermont-Ferrand, in southern France.  Jean-Louis Trintignant (leading actor of Lelouch's A MAN AND A WOMAN) is a  catholic 34 years old man looking for a girl to marry. Observing a young  blonde girl at the Mass celebration, he decides she will be the one.His  friend Antoine Vitez invites him to pass an evening at Franoise  &quot;MAUD&quot; Fabian's place. Light dialogs become soon a conversation  about the Grace, the Predestination, the Sin and the Faith. Antoine Vitez  leaves and let the not-so puritan Trintignant alone with a Maud still  chatting and lying in bed almost naked.Will Trintignant succumb to the  charm of Maud or be faithful to the blonde girl he hasn't had the chance to  meet yet ? That's the moral point of the movie. MY NIGHT AT MAUD'S is a  1968 movie, shot in black and white with english subtitles you can't remove  (!), that has won two Oscars. I sincerely hope you'll have the curiosity to  take a look at it since 5 or 6 Rohmer's movies have hit the DVD market  these last months, all of them being pure gems. Oh yes ! I forgot.

186344,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1572522127,Dennis Littrell,"[13, 15]","""The heart has it reasons which reason knows nothing of."" --Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)This is the Eric Romer film they warned you about.  There is a lot of talk, talk, and more talk.  But the talk is very interesting.  One of the main topics of discussion is Pascal's famous wager.  Pascal believed that if there is even the slightest chance of the Christian heaven being true, then as a matter of probability, one ought to be a believer.  Even a minuscule chance of everlasting paradise is worth the bet because infinity (eternity) times even a very small number is infinity.  And, of course, if not believing puts one in however small the danger of eternal damnation, then again one should be a believer.  But, as Vidal (Antoine Vitez) sagely remarks in the movie, infinity times zero is still zero.Jean-Louis Trintignant stars as a 34-year-old Catholic mathematician who has a way with women.  He runs into his old school chum, Vidal, who introduces him to Maud (Francoise Fabian), who has a way with men.  Funny but they don't quite hit it off even though she manipulates him into spending the night with her.  Their conversation is witty, subliminal and revealing.  Maud believes in the supremacy of love, Jean-Louis in being morally flexible.  Although a believing and practicing Catholic, he tells Maud that one is not going against God's will by chasing girls anymore than one is going against God's will by doing mathematics.The girl that Jean-Louis is currently chasing is 22-year-old Francoise (Maire-Christine Barrault) a blonde, Catholic girl that he has spied at church.  At first it seems that although he is certain that she is perfect for him, she is reluctant.  They too fence with words as they try to mislead and reveal at the same time, and the audience is intrigued, so much so that at times you might forget you are watching a movie.  In this sense a Romer film is like a stage play.  Whereas contemporary directors try to get by with as little dialogue as possible, to let the action itself reveal character, Romer is not shy about using dialogue to reveal character, plot, theme--the whole works.The film begins with a long close shot of Francoise's profile as she listens in church, turning twice briefly to face the camera.  She is pretty and intriguing.  Although we won't realize it until the movie is mostly over, she is the focal point of the balance between the world views of Jean-Louis and Maud.  After the night at Maud's during which Maud uses her intuition and sly intelligence to figure out Jean-Louis's character, he spends the night with Francoise.  She uses her instincts to figure out not his character so much as his aptness for her.  And then it is revealed how Francoise figures twice in the life of Maud.  I won't anticipate the revelation, but be sure and watch for it.  Suffice it to say that there are two reasons that Francoise is far from Maud's favorite person!  The film ends, as French films often do, with the ironic affirmation of bourgeois values.For today's DVD hound this movie will play slowly or not at all.  The use of dialogue as something over and above the plot and action of the film will seem demanding and perhaps old fashioned.  The deliberately drawn out scenes at church may cause you to yawn.  But I recommend you stay with it.  The movie has a quality that lingers long after the action is gone.  The underlying philosophy about the nature of human love and how it conflicts or is compatible with reason and/or religion really does reflect to some extent the quotation above from Pascal, whose spirit is akin, although he denies it, to that of Jean-Louis, the careful protagonist of this very interesting film.",4,Romer at his most conversational,1021507200,"05 16, 2002",2002,3682,"['heart', 'reasons', 'reason', 'nothing', 'Blaise', 'Pascal', '1623-1662', 'Eric', 'Romer', 'film', 'warned', 'lot', 'talk', 'talk', 'more', 'talk', 'talk', 'very', 'interesting', 'One', 'main', 'topics', 'discussion', 'Pascal', 'famous', 'wager', 'Pascal', 'believed', 'even', 'slightest', 'chance', 'Christian', 'heaven', 'being', 'true', 'then', 'matter', 'probability', 'one', 'ought', 'be', 'believer', 'Even', 'minuscule', 'chance', 'everlasting', 'paradise', 'bet', 'infinity', 'eternity', 'times', 'even', 'very', 'small', 'number', 'infinity', 'course', 'not', 'believing', 'one', 'however', 'small', 'danger', 'eternal', 'damnation', 'then', 'again', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'believer', 'Vidal', 'Antoine', 'Vitez', 'sagely', 'remarks', 'movie', 'infinity', 'times', 'zero', 'still', 'zero.Jean-Louis', 'Trintignant', 'stars', '34-year-old', 'Catholic', 'mathematician', 'who', 'way', 'women', 'old', 'school', 'chum', 'Vidal', 'who', 'Maud', 'Francoise', 'Fabian', 'who', 'way', 'men', 'Funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hit', 'off', 'even', 'spending', 'night', 'conversation', 'witty', 'subliminal', 'revealing', 'Maud', 'supremacy', 'love', 'Jean-Louis', 'being', 'morally', 'flexible', 'believing', 'practicing', 'Catholic', 'one', 'not', 'going', 'God', 'will', 'chasing', 'girls', 'anymore', 'one', 'going', 'God', 'will', 'doing', 'mathematics.The', 'girl', 'Jean-Louis', 'currently', 'chasing', '22-year-old', 'Francoise', 'Maire-Christine', 'Barrault', 'blonde', 'Catholic', 'spied', 'church', 'first', 'certain', 'perfect', 'reluctant', 'too', 'fence', 'words', 'try', 'mislead', 'reveal', 'same', 'time', 'audience', 'intrigued', 'so', 'much', 'that', 'times', 'might', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'sense', 'Romer', 'film', 'stage', 'play', 'Whereas', 'contemporary', 'directors', 'try', 'get', 'as', 'little', 'dialogue', 'possible', 'let', 'action', 'reveal', 'character', 'Romer', 'not', 'shy', 'using', 'dialogue', 'reveal', 'character', 'plot', 'theme', 'whole', 'works.The', 'film', 'long', 'close', 'shot', 'Francoise', 'profile', 'church', 'turning', 'twice', 'briefly', 'face', 'camera', 'pretty', 'intriguing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'realize', 'movie', 'mostly', 'focal', 'point', 'balance', 'world', 'views', 'Jean-Louis', 'Maud', 'night', 'Maud', 'Maud', 'intuition', 'sly', 'intelligence', 'figure', 'out', 'Jean-Louis', 'character', 'night', 'Francoise', 'instincts', 'figure', 'out', 'not', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'aptness', 'then', 'revealed', 'how', 'Francoise', 'figures', 'twice', 'life', 'Maud', 'wo', ""n't"", 'anticipate', 'revelation', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'Suffice', 'say', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'Francoise', 'far', 'Maud', 'favorite', 'person', 'film', 'French', 'films', 'often', 'do', 'ironic', 'affirmation', 'bourgeois', 'values.For', 'today', 'DVD', 'hound', 'movie', 'will', 'play', 'slowly', 'not', 'use', 'dialogue', 'something', 'plot', 'action', 'film', 'will', 'seem', 'demanding', 'perhaps', 'old', 'fashioned', 'deliberately', 'drawn', 'out', 'scenes', 'church', 'may', 'cause', 'yawn', 'recommend', 'stay', 'movie', 'quality', 'lingers', 'long', 'action', 'gone', 'underlying', 'philosophy', 'nature', 'human', 'love', 'how', 'compatible', 'reason', 'and/or', 'religion', 'really', 'reflect', 'extent', 'quotation', 'Pascal', 'spirit', 'akin', 'Jean-Louis', 'careful', 'protagonist', 'very', 'interesting', 'film']",My Night At Maud's

Like many of Rohmer's films, ""My Night at Maud's"" is about the search for a life-partner, temptation and fidelity. Also, like most Rohmer films, ""My Night at Maud's"" is made up mainly of conversation's, and some might find it ""boring"" or ""just talking."" But the conversations are interesting and intellectually stimulating, and, at the films end, the last piece of the puzzle falls into place.An engineer (Jean-Louis Trintignant) becomes infatuated with a woman he sees in Church (Marie-Christine Barrault). But before he is able to ask her out, he spends the night at the apartment of Maud (Francoise Fabian) trying to be faithful to his Catholic values by resisting her attempts at seduction. (I won't spoil the film by telling you how his night with Maud ends.) He later meets, dates, and eventually marries the woman from Church. Years later, after running into Maud at the beach, he discovers that his wife has a connection to Maud.

I admit to easing into the extended philosophical discussion of love and similar relationships.  I also found myself enjoying the subtle and not so subtle hypocracy of the participants.  However, this is a comedy in the Shakepearean mode; i.e you may be amused but it's unlikely you'll laugh.  Fair enough, I took it for the candid look at life, love and faith it presented.  I believe that Eric Rohmer's theory is that we can profess to be as open and frank as possible but we still know what to keep to ourselves.

She is young attractive and blond. Nowdays he comes across as something of a stalker.Some time later he meets and old friend and they go to vist a woman called Maude. Maude is a single mother and she and the Catholic end up alone. She talks him into staying the night but the couple do not have sex.Thus the hero heads off to marry the blond. The end of the film is a chance meeting with Maude and the realisation that the blond had by chance been Maude's husbands mistress.In 1969 this would have been seen as a pretty sexy film. It relies on the tension of whether the hero and Maude will have sex or whether the vision of the blond will keep him from straying. The irony of course being that the blond was not that virtous herself. The film maker it would seem also is of the view that Maude is a more interesting or attractive women than the blond as she can talk.The problem with the film is that it is very much a static film which is filled with huge amounts of dialogue. The sexual tension between the characters is something which would have kept audiences interested in the late 60's. Now with the change that has occured in sexual morals you just hear the dialogue. The reality that the conversation is very very dull.The other problem is that all of the characters are drop kicks. The male is a person whom the audience is meant to identify with. Yet he does not say one thing that is amusing, interesting or even notworthy. He is a person who is attracted to women on a superficial basis, falling in love without speaking to the object of his love. Maude is okay but she goes on and on and on. She also appears to be attracted to the lead drop kick which is not easy to understand.This might have rated as an interesting movie in its time but its now dull dull dull.",1,Horribly dated,1011398400,"01 19, 2002",2002,1883,"['plot', 'film', 'simple', 'enough', 'A', 'man', 'who', 'Catholic', 'woman', 'whom', 'pursue', 'young', 'attractive', 'blond', 'something', 'stalker.Some', 'time', 'later', 'old', 'friend', 'go', 'vist', 'woman', 'called', 'Maude', 'Maude', 'single', 'mother', 'Catholic', 'end', 'up', 'alone', 'staying', 'night', 'couple', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'sex.Thus', 'hero', 'marry', 'blond', 'end', 'film', 'chance', 'meeting', 'Maude', 'realisation', 'blond', 'had', 'chance', 'been', 'Maude', 'husbands', 'mistress.In', '1969', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'pretty', 'sexy', 'film', 'tension', 'hero', 'Maude', 'will', 'have', 'sex', 'vision', 'blond', 'will', 'keep', 'straying', 'irony', 'course', 'being', 'blond', 'was', 'not', 'virtous', 'film', 'maker', 'would', 'seem', 'also', 'view', 'Maude', 'more', 'interesting', 'attractive', 'women', 'blond', 'can', 'talk.The', 'problem', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'static', 'film', 'filled', 'huge', 'amounts', 'dialogue', 'sexual', 'tension', 'characters', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'audiences', 'interested', 'late', '60', 'Now', 'change', 'occured', 'sexual', 'morals', 'just', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'reality', 'conversation', 'very', 'very', 'dull.The', 'other', 'problem', 'characters', 'are', 'drop', 'kicks', 'male', 'person', 'whom', 'audience', 'meant', 'identify', 'not', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'amusing', 'interesting', 'even', 'notworthy', 'person', 'who', 'attracted', 'women', 'superficial', 'basis', 'falling', 'love', 'speaking', 'object', 'love', 'Maude', 'okay', 'also', 'be', 'attracted', 'lead', 'drop', 'kick', 'not', 'easy', 'understand.This', 'might', 'have', 'rated', 'interesting', 'movie', 'time', 'now', 'dull', 'dull', 'dull']",My Night At Maud's

For various reasons, Jean-Louis has never married, and at 34 years he finds himself lonely in this new place.  He chances to meet an old school friend, Vital (Antoine Vitez).  They have drinks and go to a bookstore and chat, primarily about religion and philosophy.  When Vital proposes that they meet up with a newly divorced friend of his, Jean-Louis balks but eventually agrees. Enter the sexy pediatrician Maud.  She attempts to seduce Jean-Louis, who is no nave virgin, but such an interlude may not be within Jean-Louis' personal moral code.  Will they end up together or will Jean-Louis find the nice Catholic girl of his dreams?""My Night at Maud's"" (1969) is the third in the series of director Eric Rohmer's Six Moral Tales, following two short films (""The Collector"" was actually made and released third in the series, but is generally placed fourth).  For various reasons, I'm just now getting around to viewing Rohmer's films even though I am a fan of many of the French Wave directors.  To me, Rohmer's films seemed from afar to be less flashy and experimental than the work of Godard or Truffaut.  I've missed out on some great work, such as ""My Night at Maud's.""  His direction and scripting here is impeccable; the film manages to be grounded in stark realism (everything the actors do is perfectly in character) and talky yet somehow glamorous and lighter than air.Some audiences will be put off by this movie, with its frequent long conversations involving religion and philosophy, focusing on Pascal's Wager.  However, I found that I didn't need to understand the minutiae of these topics (I have read a bit of Pascal years ago), as these conversations exist primarily to show us the characters' moral codes - their sense of what they can and cannot do.  As such, the movie succeeds brilliantly, demonstrating the gray areas of our moral codes that we all encounter.  It's a rare movie that I can walk away from feeling as though I learned something new, yet still assured that I probably only understand 1/4 of it.
