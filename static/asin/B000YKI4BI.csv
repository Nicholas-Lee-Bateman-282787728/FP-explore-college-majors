Now that I have all the seasons I watch them almost every night and especially after a Horror flick ( favorite kind of movies).  I love how this show reminds me of when I was a kid, they even had some of the same furniture we had.  Their chairs in their living room, we had them in our front room.

My girls just love Buffy. Even in this last season, where the kids are cutiness has pretty much worn off, the show is still very entertaining. It sure beats most of the things on tv today that are considered entertainment. In this set we get more special features with Kathy Garver. I am not sure why they did not include a Part II interview with Johnny Whitaker. Season 4 had a Part I interview with him, so I assumed we'd get a part two with this set. Unfortunately we don't.

1120182,A3TETPLQ10E0Y9,B000YKI4BI,jon sieruga,"[31, 31]","The ""Family Affair"" gang moves surprisingly steadily into their 5th and final season with some wonderful episodes for a quickly-maturing Buffy (ingratiating as always). She nearly bids farewell to faithful companion Mrs. Beasley in episode 22, and tangles with Paris Hilton's mom in episode 20 (""The Joiners"" aka ""The Mod Maidens""). In episode 4, Uncle Bill hires help for Mr. French in the guise of Nancy Walker as Emily (who makes sporadic appearances throughout the year). Kathy Garver's Cissy seems awfully busy with school during this season and is kept rushing in and out (books in hand), though she does bring over a very pregnant houseguest in episode 9 (how much you wanna bet the baby decides to arrive unexpectedly?). Although it's sad to see ""Family Affair"" reach the end of its run, the worthy stories get spread about pretty evenly, and all the Davises get their share of the spotlight. Farewell Davis Family!1.
