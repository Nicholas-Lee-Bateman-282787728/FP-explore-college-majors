He earn his income throught some underground fighting which he later give to his brother's wife(if I've not forgotten the story). They are good numbers of action fighting scenes which I could say is a remarkable effort put into this movie/film. The only problem is that this movie/film is using indication of knife which is rather unsuitable for kids (that type of thing, the 'bear' issue or this..chinese) to watch.

He left behind an estranged wife and a little girl who is in desperate need. Wanting to help, he escapes the Legion and secretly gives her money through winnings he gets from various illegal underground fights.Let me say that this story has a lot of heart (no pun intended) for an R rated film. While there is language in it, the family element in the movie is unmistakable. It would ALMOST be apporpriate for family viewing if not for the language as the violence is kept to a minium until the final fight. There is some suggestive sexuality in it but that, also, is kept very brief.Overall, this is worth a view for older teens to adults.

Lyon Gaultier, a disgruntled, often disciplined French Legionnaire stationed in Africa2.  Which family member/friend must be avenged? His brother Franois, who gets torched to a crisp after reneging on a drug deal3.  Does he take his shirt off? As a stowaway on a ship to America, Lyon is forced to shovel coal into the boilers of the boiler room.  And, whew!, does it ever get hot down there!4.  Does he have sex with a C-List actress? No, despite the fact that a rich, psychopathic, sadistic blonde fight organizer named Cynthia basically threw herself at him5.  Is there a tournament? More or less, only, winners advance to bigger and more lucrative matches with each victory6.  Is training needed for this tournament?  Not specifically.  His military training and hard labor already prepared him for battle.7.  Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? Sadly, unless mid-air splits count, the answer is no.8.  Does he punch someone in the balls?  With a well-placed single shot in his initial organized bare-knuckle fight, Lyon destroys the reproductive future for a guy who looks like the biker from the Village People.9.  Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? The question isn't ""does he"", it should be ""where does he"".  The answer: In a racquetball court, under a bridge, in a nearly empty swimming pool, and a small arena with stands.10.  Is his enemy unbeatable? Atilla basically looks like the guy one-step-to-the-left on the Evolutionary chart.  Additionally, he has saxophone-sized mutton-chop sideburns, which is scary in and of itself.11.  Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? In a previous battle, Lyon sustains a broken rib, and some betting against him know it.12.  Does he win? Yes, and it's a near perfect ending.It's uncanny how talented JCVD is at making this type of movie. If it were anyone else, the corniness would be much worse. It's almost as if his poor acting (despite this being his best acting job) makes this type of movie better. JCVD is like epicac; under normal circumstances, it's not great to chug a bottle, but when mixed with the consumption of something sure to turn your stomach otherwise, it's perfect.  Best of all, the little girl who plays Lyon's niece Nicole (Ashley Johnson) is absolutely adorable (later went on to be Mel Gibson's daughter in What Women Want), and adds a real humanistic aspect to the movie without getting in the way of the tumultuous action.",4,"Bloodsport, IN A POOL!",1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,2501,"['Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Review', 'Matrix', 'JCVD-RM', '1.', 'Who', 'Lyon', 'Gaultier', 'disgruntled', 'often', 'disciplined', 'French', 'Legionnaire', 'stationed', 'Africa2', 'Which', 'family', 'member/friend', 'must', 'be', 'avenged', 'brother', 'Franois', 'who', 'torched', 'crisp', 'reneging', 'drug', 'deal3', 'take', 'shirt', 'off', 'stowaway', 'ship', 'America', 'Lyon', 'forced', 'shovel', 'coal', 'boilers', 'boiler', 'room', 'whew', 'ever', 'get', 'hot', 'there', '4', 'Does', 'have', 'sex', 'C-List', 'actress', 'No', 'fact', 'rich', 'psychopathic', 'sadistic', 'blonde', 'fight', 'organizer', 'named', 'Cynthia', 'basically', 'threw', 'him5', 'there', 'tournament', 'More', 'less', 'only', 'winners', 'advance', 'bigger', 'more', 'lucrative', 'matches', 'victory6', 'training', 'needed', 'tournament', 'Not', 'specifically', 'military', 'training', 'hard', 'labor', 'already', 'prepared', 'battle.7', 'do', 'splits', 'training', 'tournament', 'Sadly', 'mid-air', 'splits', 'count', 'answer', 'no.8', 'punch', 'someone', 'balls', 'well-placed', 'single', 'shot', 'initial', 'organized', 'bare-knuckle', 'fight', 'Lyon', 'reproductive', 'future', 'guy', 'who', 'biker', 'Village', 'People.9', 'Does', 'do', 'series', 'flying', '360', 'kicks', 'question', ""n't"", 'should', 'be', 'where', 'answer', 'racquetball', 'court', 'bridge', 'nearly', 'empty', 'swimming', 'pool', 'small', 'arena', 'stands.10', 'enemy', 'unbeatable', 'Atilla', 'basically', 'guy', 'one-step-to-the-left', 'Evolutionary', 'chart', 'Additionally', 'saxophone-sized', 'mutton-chop', 'sideburns', 'scary', 'itself.11', 'overcome', 'injury', 'other', 'hindrance', 'previous', 'battle', 'Lyon', 'broken', 'rib', 'betting', 'know', 'it.12', 'win', 'Yes', 'near', 'perfect', 'ending.It', 'uncanny', 'how', 'talented', 'JCVD', 'making', 'type', 'movie', 'were', 'anyone', 'else', 'corniness', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'worse', 'almost', 'poor', 'acting', 'being', 'best', 'acting', 'job', 'type', 'movie', 'better', 'JCVD', 'epicac', 'normal', 'circumstances', 'not', 'great', 'chug', 'bottle', 'when', 'mixed', 'consumption', 'something', 'sure', 'turn', 'stomach', 'otherwise', 'perfect', 'Best', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'Lyon', 'niece', 'Nicole', 'Ashley', 'Johnson', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'later', 'went', 'be', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'daughter', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'real', 'humanistic', 'aspect', 'movie', 'getting', 'way', 'tumultuous', 'action']",N/A

61207,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,0783228465,Martin Asiner,"[4, 5]","Most films starring Jean-Claude Van Damme are nothing more than vehicles for showing off his considerable fighting skills.  Prior to LIONHEART, JCVD rarely had to act.  He fought a lesser series of bad guys on the way to a final confrontation with a very intimidating fighter.  Now this also sounds like a plot summary of LIONHEART, but in addition to the kicks and punches, the film also delves into some serious issues of duty versus responsibility and the meaning of friendship.JCVD plays a Legionnaire whose brother in the US is ill, so he requests permission for emergency leave.  His request is turned down on the rightful claim of his commandant that his presence in Africa was needed for Legionnaire business.  At this point, VD must decide which is of greater import: his duty to his brother or to his country.  He chooses to go AWOL to find his brother.  This choice could not have been an easy one since his decision to leave the base would necessarily entail his being labeled a deserter.  Two Legionnaire NCOs are sent to bring him back in chains.  While in America, he discovers that his brother is dead and has left behind a destitute wife and child.  VD determines to win money to provide for them by engaging in brutal cage fights.  Along the way he picks up the services of a wino manager, oily played by Harrison Page.  Slowly the two men, the fighter and the manager, lay the grounds for a binding friendship, which is tested by the manager's decision to bet on the fearsome and final opponent.  When VD finds out that his manager sold him out, you can see that the pain in his heart outweighs the more obvious pain of his bruised ribs.  When he somehow defeats this monster fighter, the scene in which his manager first congratulates then apologizes to him is both touching and convincing.As with most JCVD movies, there is plenty of eye-popping body slugging, with the final match the most interesting.  But behind the fighting, Van Damme also shows that emotional impacting on those who call him either friend or enemy is often at least as fascinating as watching him grind his most recent opponent into the dust.",3,Lionheart: About Duty &amp; Responsibility Too,1026691200,"07 15, 2002",2002,2136,"['Most', 'films', 'starring', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'vehicles', 'showing', 'off', 'considerable', 'fighting', 'skills', 'Prior', 'LIONHEART', 'JCVD', 'rarely', 'had', 'act', 'fought', 'lesser', 'series', 'bad', 'guys', 'way', 'final', 'confrontation', 'very', 'intimidating', 'fighter', 'Now', 'also', 'plot', 'summary', 'LIONHEART', 'addition', 'kicks', 'punches', 'film', 'also', 'serious', 'issues', 'duty', 'versus', 'responsibility', 'meaning', 'friendship.JCVD', 'Legionnaire', 'brother', 'US', 'ill', 'permission', 'emergency', 'leave', 'request', 'turned', 'down', 'rightful', 'claim', 'commandant', 'presence', 'Africa', 'was', 'needed', 'Legionnaire', 'business', 'point', 'VD', 'must', 'decide', 'greater', 'import', 'duty', 'brother', 'country', 'go', 'AWOL', 'find', 'brother', 'choice', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'one', 'decision', 'leave', 'base', 'would', 'necessarily', 'entail', 'being', 'labeled', 'deserter', 'Two', 'Legionnaire', 'NCOs', 'are', 'sent', 'bring', 'back', 'chains', 'America', 'brother', 'dead', 'left', 'behind', 'destitute', 'wife', 'child', 'VD', 'win', 'money', 'provide', 'engaging', 'brutal', 'cage', 'fights', 'way', 'up', 'services', 'wino', 'manager', 'oily', 'played', 'Harrison', 'Page', 'Slowly', 'two', 'men', 'fighter', 'manager', 'lay', 'grounds', 'binding', 'friendship', 'tested', 'manager', 'decision', 'bet', 'fearsome', 'final', 'opponent', 'When', 'VD', 'out', 'manager', 'sold', 'out', 'can', 'see', 'pain', 'heart', 'more', 'obvious', 'pain', 'bruised', 'ribs', 'When', 'somehow', 'monster', 'fighter', 'scene', 'manager', 'first', 'then', 'touching', 'convincing.As', 'most', 'JCVD', 'movies', 'plenty', 'eye-popping', 'body', 'slugging', 'final', 'match', 'most', 'interesting', 'fighting', 'Van', 'Damme', 'also', 'emotional', 'impacting', 'who', 'call', 'friend', 'enemy', 'often', 'least', 'as', 'fascinating', 'watching', 'grind', 'most', 'recent', 'opponent', 'dust']",N/A

61211,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,0783228465,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","The story: when his brother is murdered during a drug deal gone wrong, Lyon Gaultier (Jean-Claude Van Damme) deserts his post at the French Foreign Legion and stows away to America. Arriving in New York, he must make his way across the country to his brother's widow (Lisa Pelikan,Return to Blue Lagoon), whom he hopes to support with proceeds won from illegal underground street fighting...all while contending with a pair of Legionnaires on his trail.I've seen about half of Van Damme's films, and thus far, ""Lionheart"" is one of my least favorite for the fact that there's not enough action, and what's there is not very good. Van Damme has about seven hand-to-hand fights with various thugs and fighters of differing time lengths, but only one of them is against another martial artist (Paco Prieto,Only the Strong), and even it isn't exactly show-stopping. I'm not saying that guys like James Thompson (Gunhed), Jeff Langton (Final Impact), Stuart Wilson (""The Rundown""), Magic Schwarz (Over the Top), or Abdel Qissi (The Quest) don't look like tough guys...they just aren't very interesting fighters and don't give Van Damme a chance to show off his better moves. Since the fights were choreographed by Van Damme himself (and Frank Dux and Michael Qissi), I'm very much surprised that they're not showier, but the fact that they aren't kills at least half of this Van Damme vehicle.The acting keeps the movie afloat, mostly through the efforts the vastly underrated Harrison Page (Sledge Hammer!), who plays the stereotypical role if ever there was one of Van Damme's sidekick/partner/comic foil but is very entertaining in doing so. The aforementioned Lisa Pelikan does well as the widowed single mother, as does Deborah Rennard (""Dallas"") as the wealthy, scheming fight organizer who freely switches between using Van Damme as a gambling chip and a piece of meat. A young Ashley Johnson (What Women Want) plays Van Damme's niece, and Brian Thompson (Cobra) and Michael Qissi (Kickboxer) have small, minion-ish parts. Everybody does fine, but nobody stands out besides Page. Van Damme gives the usual performance that needs no elaboration.Not much is to be said about the story; some folks claim it's one of Van Damme's better plots, but I don't agree that it goes anywhere. There is some social half-statement about the ""sick aristocracy"" whose members get off on watching the less fortunate pummel eachother, but again, it doesn't really go anywhere. In all, the storyline didn't keep me interested, and neither did most other things about the movie. As a fan of action/fight movies in particular, I was surprised that I wasn't more entertained by this kind of film, but seeing as there are plenty more Van Damme movies out there, I don't feel too bad about giving up on this one.",2,"""Sometimes life is... is... ugly.

61216,A3UA046AA3DXFD,0783228465,Sid the Elf,"[0, 3]","Lionheart stars Jean-Claude Van Damme. So, obviously it is an Unintentional Comedy Action flick. However, we, Sid the Elf, were not expecting such a strong effort. You had Frank Dux back for another round of whippings, you had the black detective from...wait for it...Death Ring!!!!!!! That's right, a Death Ring alum. Instant 2 stars. Then, to put the cherry on the sundae we had Freddy Bisco from Scent of a Woman, and the bad guy from Cobra!Lionheart was a classically styled B-action. It had a lot of techniques from the Frank Leone(Sylvester Stallone) school of filmmaking. Van Damme was the tough fighter with a heart of gold. Teamed with the jive talking brother from Death Ring, they were the hottest onscreen couple we've seen in a long time. They even had the hug at the end instead of Van Damme and a chick. Sketchy, right? You have cheesey music which seeems to rev Van Damme's engine. You had plot streches as far as the eye could see. Van Damme jumps off a freight ship moving who-knows-how-fast in the middle of the night and swims to the shore of New York. Then, he decides to enter the glamorous world of fight clubbing. He literally starts off at the bottom, fighting homeless guys for food under a bridge. Let us interject for a second that if you're B in your own B movie, that's probably not a good sign for the future. Anyway, the guy from Death Ring ""discovers"" Van Damme and starts managing him. Ace and Gary win a few fights and make it to L.A., the big time as far as underground fighting in those days. But, they still live together in a small apartment. Hmmm. While in L.A. Dux stalks some family and kicks some major tail. He's even such an entrancing figure that the authorities are in awe of his lionheart and don't mess with him.So, Lionheart earns the Sid the Elf Seal of Approval. It is king of the jungle. Well kids, it's getting mighty close to Christmas time, so Sid will be slowing down for a while. There are many pink turkey basters to make. But he will be doing reviews as often as he can!!!!!!!",4,Lionheart starts out with a guy getting set on fire and it stays hot until the end,1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,2036,"['Lionheart', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'So', 'Unintentional', 'Comedy', 'Action', 'flick', 'However', 'Sid', 'Elf', 'were', 'not', 'expecting', 'such', 'strong', 'effort', 'had', 'Frank', 'Dux', 'back', 'round', 'whippings', 'had', 'black', 'detective', 'wait', 'Death', 'Ring', 'right', 'Death', 'Ring', 'alum', 'Instant', '2', 'stars', 'Then', 'put', 'cherry', 'sundae', 'had', 'Freddy', 'Bisco', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'bad', 'guy', 'Cobra', 'Lionheart', 'was', 'classically', 'styled', 'B-action', 'had', 'lot', 'techniques', 'Frank', 'Leone', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'school', 'filmmaking', 'Van', 'Damme', 'was', 'tough', 'fighter', 'heart', 'gold', 'Teamed', 'jive', 'talking', 'brother', 'Death', 'Ring', 'were', 'hottest', 'onscreen', 'couple', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'even', 'had', 'hug', 'end', 'instead', 'Van', 'Damme', 'chick', 'Sketchy', 'right', 'have', 'cheesey', 'music', 'rev', 'Van', 'Damme', 'engine', 'had', 'plot', 'streches', 'as', 'far', 'eye', 'could', 'see', 'Van', 'Damme', 'freight', 'ship', 'moving', 'who-knows-how-fast', 'middle', 'night', 'swims', 'shore', 'New', 'York', 'Then', 'enter', 'glamorous', 'world', 'fight', 'clubbing', 'literally', 'off', 'bottom', 'fighting', 'homeless', 'guys', 'food', 'bridge', 'Let', 'interject', 'second', ""'re"", 'B', 'own', 'B', 'movie', 'probably', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'future', 'Anyway', 'guy', 'Death', 'Ring', 'discovers', 'Van', 'Damme', 'managing', 'Ace', 'Gary', 'win', 'few', 'fights', 'make', 'L.A.', 'big', 'time', 'as', 'far', 'underground', 'fighting', 'days', 'still', 'live', 'together', 'small', 'apartment', 'Hmmm', 'L.A.', 'Dux', 'stalks', 'family', 'kicks', 'major', 'tail', 'even', 'such', 'entrancing', 'figure', 'authorities', 'are', 'awe', 'lionheart', 'do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'him.So', 'Lionheart', 'Sid', 'Elf', 'Seal', 'Approval', 'king', 'jungle', 'Well', 'kids', 'getting', 'mighty', 'close', 'Christmas', 'time', 'so', 'Sid', 'will', 'be', 'slowing', 'down', 'while', 'are', 'many', 'pink', 'turkey', 'basters', 'make', 'will', 'be', 'doing', 'reviews', 'as', 'often', 'can']",N/A
