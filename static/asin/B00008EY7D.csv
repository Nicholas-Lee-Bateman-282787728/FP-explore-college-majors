That fact is illustrated by the title. Although the cover and back description as well as other reviews point out the romantic subplot it's really about how he gets along with his family and friends.  What makes this interesting to me is that I don't live in his reality and I don't have a guardian who only speaks fractured English and doesn't know about laws concerning minors. The misunderstandings and generation/culture gap in this film could tear them apart, but it doesn't by God's grace.  It was interesting to me, but it felt a little empty due to the fact that this is fiction acting as a picture of these peoples' everyday life situation so when it ends you're not sure that any progress has been made, only that risk was taken on Victor's part to seal his relationship the girl. What impact has this had on his relationship with his family, this film doesn't know.  It feels like every relationship in this movie is still in it's infancy. It's like Peter Sollett, the director felt that simply showing real situations would be enough to be compelling and entertaining and whole.  'Raising Victor Vargas' may be the first two things, but it doesn't seem complete.  I just hope that he's learned something from this film which borrowed liberally from his approach on his award-winning short film &quot;Five feet high and Rising.&quot; The short film worked better because it didn't really need to feel like it was a whole because it was short, but it was filled up with so many compelling relationships and elements and truth and reality that it was easy to forget that you were watching something fictional.

Director/writer Peter Sollett worked within an $800K budget to release a high-quality movie, one that met with critical success and was rewarded with a good run at art houses across the country.  The result was a nice little $2.8m worldwide gross (Sollett's film was released in France under the fairly faithful title of ""Long Way Home"").  This film is an outgrowth of a short Sollett released in 2000 called ""Five Feet High and Rising.""It's neat seeing brothers Victor and Silvestre Rasuk as brothers Victor and Nino - they make a very believable on-screen family unit.

Partly out of attraction and partly out of a desire to improve his reputation, Victor pursues Judy - the neighborhood hottie. Judy at first ignores Victor's overbearing advances. But she later allows him to be her ""man"" as a means of warding off the other guys on the street who are constantly harassing her.Meanwhile Victor has a difficult home life to deal with. His very traditional grandmother is always upset with him because she sees him as providing a ""bad example"" to his younger siblings, Vicki and Nino. Victor and sister Vicki are also constantly arguing, while younger brother Nino is a good ""church boy"" who longs to meet girls like his older brother. Grandmother is a well intentioned and charming character who sometimes goes a bit too far in her efforts to control the teen-agers. Nino is perhaps the most sensitive and intelligent member of the family. He is gradmother's favorite but is also experiencing the awakening of his adolescent sexuality. His discovered masturbation and grandmother's extreme reaction to it provide one of the best and funniest scenes in the movie. Meanwhile Vicki has her own romantic problems as she endures the awkward advances of Judy's brother Carlos, a nervous but sweet ""gordito"".Meanwhile Judy has started to develop feelings for Victor as he reveals his true self rather than the phony playboy he was trying to be. The movie culminates in an excellent scene where both the grandmother and the teen-agers realize that they must learn to respect and trust each other if family happiness is ever to be achieved.With all the big money being spent on mindless Hollywood blockbusters. It is a pleasure to find a low-budget indie film like this where quality filmmaking tells a sincere and realistic story of young love in a place where most of us never venture.

For anyone who wondered if having a camera, fabulous actors, and a moving story was enough... that film proved it. I lived in New York for many years, had some similar romances (although not really in the same environment) and the film really captured something.Now we have this feature-length version of the same type of material. This film is also exceedingly well made, full of emotion, and captivating. Victor's relationships are all adequately developed, it explores more manifestations of love, and over a longer period of time, but has missed out on the intimacy of the original short film. This is still a moving piece of work, but I didn't walk away feeling blown away. Maybe that's the curse of shooting such an incredible film beforehand.The other thing I would say is that I would have enjoyed some of the scenes more if the younger brother had been developed into a substantial character, and the grandmother hadn't been quite as monomaniacal. It seemed a bit too four-walled (is that the right terminology?) at times and lackluster.

Victor Vargas (an inordinately talented Victor Rasuk), one of three siblings left in the care of their grandma (played with infinite wisdom and beauty by Altagracia Guzman)is of the age where he is acting the role of the macho ladies' man and is surrounded by friends who let is be known that he is getting his satisfaction from a fat loose girl they all tease.  Victor reacts and pledges to conquer Judy ( a beautiful Judy Marte), a girl who is wise to the hormonal drives of the young men she confronts in her seedy neighborhood. Director Sollett follows the emotional maturation of these two as they slowly and with growing wisdom approach a relationship.  Along this path is the hilarious ranting of Grandma who fears her family is falling into the depths of sin.The setting, though on location and anything but beautiful, is photographed as though it were as meaningful as a Romeo/Juliet Italy.  Oddly, the music in the background is Bach instead of Hip Hop - a hint of the sensitivity in store for you as you discover how fine simple storytelling on film can be in the hands of committed actors and crew.

741114,AAX9ZIMIYJ77W,B00008EY7D,Lei,"[0, 1]","One of the best independent films I've seen. Everything on film looks so natural and realistic. Victor Rasuk plays Victor Vargas, an adolescent Dominican who lives on the lower east side of New York. Victor lives with his goody-two-shoes brother, quick witted little sister, and watchful grandmother. He has his eye on a girl named Judy Marte, but struggles to gain her affections. The opening scene is quite funny and awkward. I think what pleases most audiences while watching Raising Victor Vargas, is the quality of acting amongst the kids. They act like a real family who argues with each other on a daily basis. There is a scene where Victor is showing Judy photos of his family. He days, ""there's my sister, but she's fat now."" I just thought this was funny. As if her being fat has anything to do with who she is or her personality, or something we should base our judgment on her for. The sister, Vicky De La Cruz (Krystal Rodriguez, who did an amazing job in this film) was really funny. She snaps back at her brothers in defense. She always knows what's going on with Victor and his personal agenda. She does well to install anxiety in Victor about his relationship with ""Fat Donna"". Victor is so corny in his attempts to seduce Judy. He's got a lot of confidence in himself, which comes off as arrogance of course. My favorite scene was when he showed her the baby chick in the filing cabinet. So heartwarming. In the meantime, Judy's friend Melonie has been talking to Victor's friend in private for lots of awkward flirting and messing around. Over time, Victor eventually gains Judy's trust by going out for walks with her and trying to entertain her. Overall though, Victor poses to be a troublesome teenager for his grandmother to raise. That grandmother gives the boys no privacy whatsoever. She considers Victor a bad influence for the rest of the family and asks him to leave the home when she catches Victor's brother doing something sinful. The child protective services rejected this and told her to take victor back home. The family must stay together.  All in all, Raising Victor Vargas is an illuminating, comical, and down to earth film of growing up and the confusion and awkwardness that comes with it.

741115,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00008EY7D,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 3]","This 2003 independent film is about young love. It was written and directed by 26-year old Peter Sollett, and has all the earmarks of a fresh young filmmaker.The story is simple.  Victor Vargas, played by Victor Rasuk, is a teenage boy who is looking for love.  He lives with his grandmother, played by Altagracia Guzman, and his younger brother and sister in a poor, but idealized neighborhood in New York City.  His grandmother, who had emigrated from the Dominican Republic years before, clearly loves her grandchildren and does her best to keep the family together.  However, she's a little too quick to consider them depraved simply because Victor is romancing a girl and because his younger brother, played by Silvestre Rusuk, is experimenting with is own sexuality behind closed bathroom doors. In an inspired bit of casting, these two real-life brothers look so much alike that it gives the feel of a real family.Victor meets the girl of his dreams, Judy Marte, and they begin a romance.  They are both inexperienced and it takes a while for their first kiss.  There are a few twists and turns to the plot, and some obstacles which get in the way, but basically it is just a sweet love story.  One of the most interesting things about the story though is that there are no guns, drugs or violent acts.  They might be living in a neighborhood known for these things but yet they are all remarkably innocent.I enjoyed the film and thought it was well done. But frankly, it was a little too simple for my personal tastes.  It seemed to me like amateurs doing their best in a first film.  Which, of course, is exactly what it is.  I must give the film an &quot;A&quot; for effort though.

741116,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B00008EY7D,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[34, 36]","Although independent films such as this have virtually no DVD extras, sometimes the subtleties of the film itself can more easily be grasped on the small screen than in the theater.  I saw ""Raising Victor Vargas"" in both venues, and preferred the intimacy of the DVD.""Juicy Judy"", played by Judy Marte in Peter Sollett's 2003 independent film, ""Raising Victor Vargas"" has no intention of being impressed by the insouciant Victor (Victor Rasuk) of title fame. She's grown through adolescence in the poor area of New York's lower east side.  She's remained aloof to the enticements that come to her because of her beauty and look of wariness.  She prefers to spend her time with best friend Melonie (Melonie Diaz), talking about life and love; exasperated by how much she is approached by men and boys.  She's drawn a shell about herself, her composure untouched, her lack of trust in anyone outside Melonie and her family is palpable.  We see her early on with only one gesture of instantaneous emotion, and that is when she impulsively hugs and kisses her chubby little brother at the community pool.  If Director Sollett missed anything in this movie, it is a better glimpse of Judy's family life, what things contributed to her sense of pride and why she is so comfortable in her aloneness, not falling prey to the syndrome that is pride and risk-taking by beautiful young girls.We see Judy through the eyes of  Victor Vargas.  Victor appears to be much younger than he is - he's trying to live down a tryst with the ""fat girl"" Donna, in the neighborhood.  Victor has been practicing his initial sexual moves with Donna, and, in the opening scene, they are clumsy and almost endearing.  Less so is the speed with which he discards Donna.  He needs to score with the beautiful Judy, who he sees at the neighborhood pool.Undaunted by her declarations that ""she has a man"", he begins to pursue her, but in a manner that his own vulnerabilities show through.  Judy begins to relax by having him around, senses that she can trust him, decides that he can at least be the brunt of others' advances to her, if he is her man.  In a funny aside, friend Melonie shows absolutely no restraint with Victor's buddy, immediately beginning a teenage love affair.Unlike his approach to Judy, Sollett allows us to see the manner in which Victor was raised, and it is through this understanding that we are drawn to him.  Arrogant in his street persona, Victor is too open to not show his own fears and insecurities.  He lives with his Grandma (the delightful Altagracia Guzman) and has to share a room in their crowded flat with younger sister Vicki (Krystal Roderiguez) and youngest brother Nino (Rasuk's brother Silvestre Rasuk)- all three are adolescents.  It is obvious from the get go that the friction in the family is between Victor and the irascible Vicki and Victor and his grandma.Raised on a peaceful farm in the Dominican Republic, Grandma tries hard to get used to city life.  She has a straightforward way of dealing with indiscretions by the children.  She is upset when Victor and Vicki fight over the phone, and installs a lock on the phone so that no one can use it.  She's at her wits end as the children get older - any small indiscretion by Victor is cause for alarm, and she puts the fear of God in him by taking him to DCF and trying to give up her right to raise him.  Although she has the grace to back down from her position, she's frightened all three kids by the lengths she is willing to go for her belief that they need to be a ""nice family"".  She's instilled Catholic rituals in them, and all three accompany her to church.  There is little doubt that she's had little education, and speaks English that is heavily accented.  Grandma's Achilles heel is Nino, but then, Nino is so awkward, so loving and real, that it is hard for anyone to resist him.  Nino is struggling with puberty, and a humorous incident of Grandma finding him masturbating in the bathroom is made all the more so by Grandma's insistence that it must be Victor who taught him to sin.Victor's two worlds come together by his own design.  Without a thought of what Judy will think of his family, or his family will think of Judy, he invites her to dinner.  The awkwardness and awareness of the emotional ties between son and family and son and lover are illustrated beautifully by Sollett in a painful scenario that surprisingly, ends well.Even if you've not recently lived with teenagers, you can sense the passage from the confused and insecure portrayal of early adolescence (Nino and Vicki) to the street-smart, tough talking but even more vulnerable 16 and older teens (Victor and Judy).  You can feel the impact of poverty on the kids, but you can also see real life, not weighted down by crime and violence.  You can sense how strong bonds are formed by the merest willingness of one kid to try to understand another kid, and to talk about what they are felling.  You get a sense of the strength of respect between generations in Hispanic families and the retreat that the family provides from the outside world.Sollett, previously having won awards for a short film, ""Five Feet High and Rising"", gives a marvelous novella (almost a pseudo-documentary) on the story of first love, on the powerful pull of family relationships, in a simple tale about real people.  I hope he never loses his ability to tell a story as the budgets he is awarded get bigger and bigger.The camera play is a little awkward, but the sequencing, editing, choices of backdrop and small bits of music are all gems in a realistic film that was one of my Top Ten in 2003.Those who crave action and intricate plotting, or laugh out loud comedy will not find it in ""Raising Victor Vargas"", a rare little coming of age film with a superb cast of unknowns.A definite must-see; you'll love the honesty of this film.",5,Deserves applause.,1079049600,"03 12, 2004",2004,5874,"['independent',

741117,A2K0VRRUK2KEDX,B00008EY7D,"Luis M. Luque ""luquel""","[8, 16]","I love small, quiet, subtle movies.  I root for independent films.  I'm sick of Hollywood blockbusters about comic book action heroes that have nothing remotely in common with anything resembling real life.  I've been a fan of Miramax since they began.  I really liked &quot;Whale Rider.&quot;  I'm a huge fan of foreign movies like &quot;Cinema Paradiso,&quot; &quot;Raise the Red Lantern,&quot; &quot;The Bicycle Thief,&quot; &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,&quot; &quot;Mediterraneo&quot; and countless others.  I think much (if not most) of what Hollywood perpetrates these days is pure trash.  Well, despite all that, despite the fact that I really wanted to like this movie, I'm sorry, even though this is honest storytelling, honestly, the story isn't worth telling.  I watched and yawned, occasionally chuckled, but mostly I didn't care at all about what happened to Victor Vargas or any of those around him.  Perhaps that says something about me as a human being.  Maybe I'm too comfortable living in the suburbs, going to the malls, watching foreign films in the comfort of my living room, sending my kids off to mostly white schools and soccer camps.  Whatever.  No matter what you might think about me, though, it doesn't change the fact that this movie, despite what the critics will tell you -- critics who I generally agree with -- Victor Vargas, the character and the movie, are just plain boring.  Everyday life isn't exciting.  That's why we go to the movies.  That's why we read books.  That's why we go to the theater, the opera, concerts, sporting events.  That's why we change jobs, take vacations, take up hobbies, have affairs, go back to school and leave our spouses and families in search of something we can't put our fingers on.  Because real life just isn't that interesting, at least not all the time.  Certainly, it doesn't always make for interesting movies.  &quot;Raising Victor Vargas&quot; is case in point.  It proves that art is not life.  Art is a heightening of life.  I can watch the grass grow, the paint peal, the bird take flight, the young couple hold hands, the addict get high and the cop make his bust whenever I feel like it.  And if I want to watch a movie about the problems of youth growing up in New York or anywhere else in America, I'll find a worthy documentary.  But art should make any of those events unusual and interesting, not ordinary and boring.  Art needs an audience after all.  Don't waste your time on Victor Vargas; it's real, it has a message, it's well acted, well directed, but it's definitely not a story that needed telling.  And it's not art.  It's just plain boring.",1,"Honest and real, but sorry, it's just plain boring",1087516800,"06 18, 2004",2004,2658,"['love', 'small', 'quiet', 'subtle', 'movies', 'root', 'independent', 'films', ""'m"", 'sick', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'comic', 'book', 'action', 'heroes', 'have', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'common', 'anything', 'resembling', 'real', 'life', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Miramax', 'began', 'really', 'liked', 'quot', 'Whale', 'Rider.', 'quot', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'foreign', 'movies', 'quot', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'quot', 'quot', 'Raise', 'Red', 'Lantern', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bicycle', 'Thief', 'quot', 'quot', 'Women', 'Verge', 'Nervous', 'Breakdown', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mediterraneo', 'quot', 'countless', 'others', 'think', 'much', 'not', 'most', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'pure', 'trash', 'Well', 'fact', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'even', 'honest', 'storytelling', 'honestly', 'story', ""n't"", 'worth', 'telling', 'watched', 'yawned', 'occasionally', 'chuckled', 'mostly', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'Victor', 'Vargas', 'Perhaps', 'something', 'about', 'human', 'being', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'too', 'comfortable', 'living', 'suburbs', 'going', 'malls', 'watching', 'foreign', 'films', 'comfort', 'living', 'room', 'sending', 'kids', 'mostly', 'white', 'schools', 'soccer', 'camps', 'matter', 'what', 'might', 'think', 'though', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'movie', 'what', 'critics', 'will', 'tell', 'critics', 'who', 'generally', 'agree', 'Victor', 'Vargas', 'character', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'Everyday', 'life', ""n't"", 'exciting', 'why', 'go', 'movies', 'why', 'read', 'books', 'why', 'go', 'theater', 'opera', 'concerts', 'sporting', 'events', 'why', 'change', 'jobs', 'take', 'vacations', 'take', 'up', 'hobbies', 'have', 'affairs', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'leave', 'spouses', 'families', 'search', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'fingers', 'real', 'life', 'just', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'least', 'not', 'time', 'Certainly', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'interesting', 'movies', 'quot', 'Raising', 'Victor', 'Vargas', 'quot', 'case', 'point', 'art', 'not', 'life', 'Art', 'heightening', 'life', 'can', 'watch', 'grass', 'grow', 'paint', 'peal', 'bird', 'take', 'flight', 'young', 'couple', 'hold', 'hands', 'addict', 'get', 'high', 'cop', 'make', 'bust', 'whenever', 'feel', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'problems', 'youth', 'growing', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'anywhere', 'else', 'America', ""'ll"", 'find', 'worthy', 'documentary', 'art', 'should', 'make', 'events', 'unusual', 'interesting', 'not', 'ordinary', 'boring', 'Art', 'audience', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'Victor', 'Vargas', 'real', 'message', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'directed', 'definitely', 'not', 'story', 'needed', 'telling', 'not', 'art', 'just', 'plain', 'boring']",Raising Victor Vargas

Though it gives a good slice of culture in the Puerto Rican, Dominican, Latino lower East Side New York it transcends culture as well.  It tells of humanity with ethnicity as an afterthought.The cast is a group of non-professional actors that seem like they have been acting for years.  This leaves the movie with a documentary feel that focuses on the story of boy becoming a man and a grandmother attempting to hold a family together as best she knows how...she ends up painfully growing too.There's no big care chases, we don't get to witness people dying on screen, no big explosions or gun fights, but we are riveted by the tale.  It proves the pundits wrong I believe...a movie doesn't have to be big Hollywood to gain an audience.  &quot;Victor Vargas&quot; speaks for itself and running the course will keep drawing in audiences by word of mouth and reputation.Victor finds a way to make the best out of life, to hold a family together, to gain a rite of passage to manhood, to fall in love along the way.

In a family of Dominicans, grandma rules the little New York City apartment with gray-haired steel. Victor is the older brother, maybe sixteen years old who is rejecting Grandmas conservative Catholic morals. He fancies himself a ladies man. His younger brother hangs on his brother's every word about girls. Victor's younger teen sister has a new admirer who absolutely loves her with vomit and tears. Victor is physically experienced, but he knows little about a girl's psyche. Victor gets caught boinking the local fat girl and his Romeo credentials are tarnished, so he campaigns to hook up with a juicy honey. All the scenes are urban and poor. The Latin kids are American in temperament, but as in all classic coming-to-America immigrant stories, the tension is created by clashes between the emerging young and the older generation.
