1354145,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003M986TS,Grady Harp,"[38, 39]","Sandra Nettlebeck both wrote and directed this somber, intense study about clinical depression.  The film is long, is a one-note song, and is in need of editing and lightening - or is it?  What Nettleback has created is an atmosphere that very likely simulates the way the world is viewed and coped with by those who are suffering from suicidal depression.  It is a lesson as much as it is a film.Helen (Ashley Judd) is a popular professor of music theory, and accomplished pianist, and the wife of handsome and successful lawyer David (Goran Visnjic), and mother of a charming teenager Julie (Alexia Fast) all of whom we meet at a surprise birthday party for Helen.  But very gradually Helen begins to change from the ebullient happy woman to a more quiet, pensive, obviously injured woman.  Concentration fails, she cannot get enough sleep, her connection to the world begins to crumble and finally she breaks into the depths of depression.  Despite the support of David and Julie and denying the medical assistance of psychiatrist Dr. Sherman (Alberta Watson), Helen continues to sink deeper into the profound sadness of clinical depression.  One of Helen's students, Mathilda (Lauren Lee Smith) seems to be one of the few people with whom Helen can relate: we are lead to discover Mathilda suffers from a similar disorder.  The truth about Helen's medical history finally surfaces: she has had suicidal ideation and clinical depression in her past When married before to Frank (David Hewlett) and soon after the birth of Julie (?postpartum depression?) Helen required psychiatric hospitalization, her marriage failed, and she ultimately met David who has been the ideal husband and father for Julie. Helen escapes her home, is hospitalized and undergoes shock therapy after a suicide attempt - her only apparent understanding contact is the nebulously drawn Mathilda.  How Helen emerges from her illness and reorganizes her life is the ending of the film.The film benefits greatly from the moody musical score by Tim Despic with the aid of James Edward Barker ( and Schumann and Schubert...) and the mood is kept appropriately dark by the cinematography by Michael Bertl.  The quartet of actors - Judd, Visnjic, Smith, and Fast) - are outstanding as is the well selected group of actors for supporting roles.  But for this study of the depths of depression - mostly dark scenes of Helen lying in bed or weeping - is, at two hours, a bit more than an audience can handle.  In order to appreciate the quality of this film the viewer must accept the fact that the main point of the film is a study of the crippling illness of depression. And that it does extremely well.

1354147,AYZLXLVMJGTJV,B003M986TS,L. J Nary,"[7, 10]","This movie is about a young married woman with a teenaged daughter who at first shows herself as calm and well poised. She is gifted with the ability to play piano and to teach music to college age students. Her husband is an attorney who loves her and they have a happy upper class family life. All seems normal and a desired goal by most standards of the population. Helen is a gentle soft-spoken female who is played by Ashley Judd. This was a character role that seemed different than I have seen Ashley play at. She has acted in some movies as a strong role model, yet in Ruby she was a reflective quieter actor, still there was strength. This role was taking a well-adjusted person into a dark despairing spiral of depression and inability to cope with the world around her. The meltdown went really quickly, which didn't feel quite right. Her symptoms just came on. The trigger seemed to be her husbands manner at work one morning and a girl student she met late nite at her academy. It is hard to know for certain if thats what set her out of control feelings to surface. The rest of the movie is how she deals with the imbalance in her emotional status. She tends to try a medical route or her husband does. She seems to just be led by his decisions until finally striking out against him and those wanting to see her change. She seems to want to be accepted as is. Her lack of involvement with life is to hard for her family to watch, they want to pull her out of the feelings rather than support her process. She meets up with the artistic cello playing student who also suffers from the havoc of feelings. They bond yet her depression does not change, it is a shared connection that allows her to be herself rather than a wife or a mother. She is still holding onto the pain and using drugs to escape with sleep, but she can be in this place without any requirements to change. Her decision to take medication and let the hospital adminster ect happens from her own volition. She makes this choice somehow from the process of her unfolding depression without any pressure placed upon her. I don't like her direction of healing but I do like that she decided to act and bring forth change to her life. Change in any way brings new direction and choices to us as individuals. The things I liked about this film, I liked the reflection and processing that took place after I viewed this movie, I liked her beautiful house and all the pretty dishes, I liked the good coffee that she drank with her expensive coffee machine, I liked that she ran thru the anonomyous streets and I liked her softness and creativity with music. Another thing I liked was her connection with the younger student. It was real and love seemed to sprout from it. They had each others understanding, it wasn't meant to last forever, because change needed to happen but while it was, it felt true and meaningful to both girls.

1354149,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003M986TS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 2]","Helen (Sandra Nettlebeck, 2009)Ashley Judd is singularly excellent at playing people who are about to break down, in the process of breaking down, or have just broken down. I'm not sure what, if anything, that says about Ms. Judd's personal life, but it does make many of her performances schadenfreude-style treats when consumed on the big screen. And the first thirty-odd minutes of Sandra Nettlebeck's Helen are described perfectly by this. Unfortunately, the movie runs two hours.Plot: Helen (Judd) and David (ER's Goran Visnjic) are a seemingly happy couple whose life couldn't be better--that is, until Helen begins changing. It's not much of a spoiler to tell you that she's sliding into depression (like I said, this stage of the film is its first quarter, give or take). And we're not talking rainy-day blues here, we're talking crippling, life-threatening depression. She eventually hits bottom and deserts her family--and her doctor--to bond with Mathilde (Lie with Me's Lauren Lee Smith), a similarly-affected former student of hers, while David tries to figure out what went wrong and how to make it better.It's impossible to get into the meat of why the last three-quarters of the movie don't work without what some may consider spoilers, though they have to do with the experience of depression rather than things specific to the film, so I will throw in a spoiler alert here and let the reader beware. The problem is that ""what went wrong"" is, as will be instantly recognizable by anyone who has lived through this kind of depression or lived with someone who has lived through this kind of depression, the wrong question entirely to be asking. I have no doubt that was Nettlebeck's point; the problem is that if her intention was to portray the ineffectual nature of David's quest leading to almost causing his own breakdown, she perhaps did it too well, as watching it is almost as frustrating as living it. One review I read of the film recently said this is a lesson as much as it is a movie. Indeed. And the didactic nature is liable to grate on anyone who already knows the answer.Still, Ashley Judd's performance in the first part of this movie does make this worth watching, though I think you'd be forgiven for deciding to turn it off halfway through. **",2,"Starts off solid, and then...",1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,2279,"['Helen', 'Sandra', 'Nettlebeck', '2009', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'singularly', 'excellent', 'playing', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'break', 'down', 'process', 'breaking', 'down', 'have', 'just', 'broken', 'down', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'anything', 'Ms.', 'Judd', 'personal', 'life', 'make', 'many', 'performances', 'schadenfreude-style', 'treats', 'when', 'consumed', 'big', 'screen', 'first', 'thirty-odd', 'minutes', 'Sandra', 'Nettlebeck', 'Helen', 'are', 'described', 'perfectly', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'two', 'hours.Plot', 'Helen', 'Judd', 'David', 'ER', 'Goran', 'Visnjic', 'are', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'couple', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'Helen', 'changing', 'not', 'much', 'spoiler', 'tell', 'sliding', 'depression', 'said', 'stage', 'film', 'first', 'quarter', 'give', 'take', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'rainy-day', 'blues', 'here', ""'re"", 'talking', 'crippling', 'life-threatening', 'depression', 'eventually', 'bottom', 'family', 'doctor', 'bond', 'Mathilde', 'Lie', 'Me', 'Lauren', 'Lee', 'Smith', 'similarly-affected', 'former', 'student', 'hers', 'David', 'tries', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'how', 'make', 'impossible', 'get', 'meat', 'why', 'last', 'three-quarters', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'what', 'may', 'consider', 'spoilers', 'have', 'do', 'experience', 'depression', 'rather', 'things', 'specific', 'film', 'will', 'throw', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'here', 'let', 'reader', 'beware', 'problem', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'will', 'be', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'anyone', 'who', 'lived', 'kind', 'depression', 'lived', 'someone', 'who', 'lived', 'kind', 'depression', 'wrong', 'question', 'entirely', 'be', 'asking', 'have', 'doubt', 'was', 'Nettlebeck', 'point', 'problem', 'intention', 'was', 'portray', 'ineffectual', 'nature', 'David', 'quest', 'leading', 'almost', 'causing', 'own', 'breakdown', 'perhaps', 'did', 'too', 'well', 'watching', 'almost', 'as', 'frustrating', 'living', 'One', 'review', 'read', 'film', 'recently', 'said', 'lesson', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'Indeed', 'didactic', 'nature', 'liable', 'grate', 'anyone', 'who', 'already', 'answer.Still', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'performance', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'forgiven', 'deciding', 'turn', 'off', 'halfway', '**']",Helen

The cinematography by Michael Bertyl, starts with a little light and grows ever cloudy and dark as does the entire movie.The character development of Helen is uncustomary and meticulously portrayed by Ashley Judd.  Goran Visnjic portrays David as the most caring, frustrated, bewildered and supportive husband to Helen. Mathilda (Lauren Lee Smith) has you constantly questioning if there will ever be a life worth living for her.Needless to say, this movie is dark, painful and reflective. It explores a topic that some may wish to turn their heads from and others, like myself, are exceedingly interested in.  This is not an easy view, but an intense look into a very pervasive issue.Helen is a college level professor of music married to her second husband David, an attorney.  She has a teenage daughter from her first marriage.  At first blush, this family looks like your everyday happy trio. Until something happens to Helen which causes her to begin acting completely out of character.She starts losing track of time, forgetting what has been transpiring with her class and losing the context of the lectures she is giving while speaking. As Helen is walking down the hall in the college, she notices a lit room with a beckoning cello being played and walks curiously inside. One of her students, Mathilda, is all upset that she 'just cannot get it right'.  The music isn't to her liking.  Helen has a pull unawares toward her as does Mathilda at the same time.David is noticing so many concerns at home and is very anxious about Helen's inability to sleep or eat. She has forgotten how to play the piano as she once did brilliantly. David finds her just sitting in her car late at night and crying. Helen walked right out of a restaurant during a meal with co-workers for no apparent reason, and begins having panic attacks. These are just a few examples of her changes in behavior.Mathilda is running a parallel in her own life as they both end up hospitalized.  David can no longer handle all of this at home, even with taking a leave of absence from work. Helen remains close to Mathilda as David's jealousy is piqued. She has completely withdrawn into herself and shuts out her husband. Only the fragile Mathilda is allowed to share in Helen's life at this point, as they can empathize while going through similar situations.After leaving the hospital, Helen's life is whirling out of control as the agony she feels cannot be expunged.  During a desperate night of relentless anguish, Helen makes an attempt at taking her life.This is really just setting up the movie in all that is to follow.
