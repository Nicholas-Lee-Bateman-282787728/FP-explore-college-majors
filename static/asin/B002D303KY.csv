1263000,A3L2856DIMUXJY,B002D303KY,&#34;Belgo Geordie&#34;,"[2, 3]","I looked forward to this movie. My father grew up under occupation in Belgium. He was about the same age as the protagonist when the Germans invaded in May 1940. He was an active resistant who fled in late 1941 to eventually wash up on the shores of England in April 1943. He never talked about the time under occupation or that his brother, a year younger was a Flemish nationalist and possible fascist. My father returned to Belgium in 1946 but said he was disgusted with all the heroes hogging glory who did nothing during the war. He left and never returned living out his short life in England. So I sat down expecting something special. What this was a war movie with a contrived plot, superb cinematography and ok acting. But it did not deliver on its reviews. For example, I was not convinced by the unmasking of the collaborator, they were, when exposed making so many errors that even the 14 year old would have sprung them far sooner-let alone active resistants. For example, what collaborator would have travelled with Nazi propaganda material in their suitcase when on the run and what 14 year old in those conditions would not have gone through everyone's possessions who sheltered under their roof as a matter of curiosity, fact and survival. I think I set my sights too high and maybe I will watch it again in a year's time with less expectation.",3,Over hyped this does not deliver on its promise,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,1362,"['looked', 'forward', 'movie', 'father', 'grew', 'up', 'occupation', 'Belgium', 'was', 'same', 'age', 'protagonist', 'when', 'Germans', 'invaded', 'May', '1940', 'was', 'active', 'resistant', 'who', 'fled', 'late', '1941', 'eventually', 'wash', 'up', 'shores', 'England', 'April', '1943', 'never', 'talked', 'time', 'occupation', 'brother', 'year', 'younger', 'was', 'Flemish', 'nationalist', 'possible', 'fascist', 'father', 'returned', 'Belgium', '1946', 'said', 'was', 'disgusted', 'heroes', 'hogging', 'glory', 'who', 'did', 'nothing', 'war', 'left', 'never', 'returned', 'living', 'out', 'short', 'life', 'England', 'So', 'sat', 'down', 'expecting', 'something', 'special', 'What', 'was', 'war', 'movie', 'contrived', 'plot', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'ok', 'acting', 'did', 'not', 'deliver', 'reviews', 'example', 'was', 'not', 'convinced', 'unmasking', 'collaborator', 'were', 'when', 'exposed', 'making', 'so', 'many', 'errors', 'even', '14', 'year', 'old', 'would', 'have', 'sprung', 'far', 'sooner-let', 'alone', 'active', 'resistants', 'example', 'what', 'collaborator', 'would', 'have', 'travelled', 'Nazi', 'propaganda', 'material', 'suitcase', 'when', 'run', 'what', '14', 'year', 'old', 'conditions', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'gone', 'everyone', 'possessions', 'who', 'sheltered', 'roof', 'matter', 'curiosity', 'fact', 'survival', 'think', 'set', 'sights', 'too', 'high', 'maybe', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'year', 'time', 'less', 'expectation']",N/A
1263001,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B002D303KY,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 1]","A fine World War II film made by the Dutch. As the winter of 1944-1945 rages, and the population in the German occupied Netherlands suffers famine, a teenage boy in a small farm town, son of the politically ambivalent mayor, risks his life by helping a downed British pilot who is hiding in the nearby forest. Adapted from a well regarded novel, the film is nothing extraordinary, and is far less flashy than the similarly themed Black Book but is enjoyable nonetheless. The storytelling is conventional and a bit slow at times but is solid and so is the acting. The wonderful bluish photography and the wintery landscape full of snowy fields and forests helps the movie (the film was shot in the Netherlands and in Lithuania). One may take issue with a few parts here and there (for instance, why the boy decides to continue helping the pilot even after he is unwittingly responsible for his father execution) but these objections seem minor in the face of a well made movie.",4,Nothing extraordinary but solid World War II film,1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,976,"['fine', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'film', 'made', 'Dutch', 'winter', '1944-1945', 'rages', 'population', 'German', 'occupied', 'Netherlands', 'suffers', 'famine', 'teenage', 'boy', 'small', 'farm', 'town', 'son', 'politically', 'ambivalent', 'mayor', 'risks', 'life', 'helping', 'downed', 'British', 'pilot', 'who', 'hiding', 'nearby', 'forest', 'Adapted', 'well', 'regarded', 'novel', 'film', 'nothing', 'extraordinary', 'far', 'less', 'flashy', 'similarly', 'themed', 'Black', 'Book', 'enjoyable', 'nonetheless', 'storytelling', 'conventional', 'bit', 'slow', 'times', 'solid', 'so', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'bluish', 'photography', 'wintery', 'landscape', 'full', 'snowy', 'fields', 'forests', 'helps', 'movie', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Netherlands', 'Lithuania', 'One', 'may', 'take', 'issue', 'few', 'parts', 'here', 'there', 'instance', 'why', 'boy', 'continue', 'helping', 'pilot', 'even', 'unwittingly', 'responsible', 'father', 'execution', 'objections', 'seem', 'minor', 'face', 'well', 'made', 'movie']",N/A

I am a WWII collector and historian, and the movie was absolutely dull.  The character development was non-existant, the action was nowhere to be found, and the story was really boring.  I didn't care at all about the subtitles, but the movie wasn't good.  The part I really hated was the RAF pilot.  His character was bland and very ungrateful.  The poor boy lost his father, horse, and uncle as a direct result of helping the pilot.  He even lost his sister in the end as she had to run away with her new British man.  I don't care if people think it is good, because it isn't.  A movie like Letters from Iwo Jima is so much better and well produced than this.  Winter in Wartime is a movie I will never recommend to anyone.

Barad,"[0, 0]","A lushly photographed, but heartbreaking film that takes place in a snowy, picturesque Dutch village where an air of fear and danger emanates from a merciless occuping army in the winter of 1945. Collaboration, betrayal, bravery and beauty are all encompassed in this exceptionally well-done foreign film, and the suspense builds up to an unbearable level as the plot unfolds.  My only complaint would be that the subtitles  inexplicably disappear and reappear during several scenes of spoken dialogue, and this will be a hindrance to those who depend on them.",4,"""Lushly Filmed but Heartbreaking""",1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,560,"['lushly', 'photographed', 'heartbreaking', 'film', 'place', 'snowy', 'picturesque', 'Dutch', 'village', 'where', 'air', 'fear', 'danger', 'emanates', 'merciless', 'occuping', 'army', 'winter', '1945', 'Collaboration', 'betrayal', 'bravery', 'beauty', 'are', 'encompassed', 'exceptionally', 'well-done', 'foreign', 'film', 'suspense', 'up', 'unbearable', 'level', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'only', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'subtitles', 'inexplicably', 'disappear', 'reappear', 'several', 'scenes', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'will', 'be', 'hindrance', 'who', 'depend']",N/A
1263004,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002D303KY,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","In 2008, the Dutch war film ""Oorlogswinter"" (Winter in Wartime), an adaptation of the popular 1972 Dutch novel by Jan Terlouw is directed by Martin Koolhoven (""Suzy Q"", ""AmnesiA"", ""Het Schnitzelparidjs"")  became one of Netherlands top grossing films.Winning multiple awards and receiving rave reviews from critics worldwide, ""Winter in Wartime"" finally receives its long-awaited Blu-ray and DVD release (via a Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack) in America courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics in July 2011.The film would introduce young actor Martijn Lakemeier (""Lover and Loser"", ""Sonny Boy"") and stars Yorick van Wageningen (""The Chronicles of Riddick"", ""The New World"", ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""), Melody Klaver (""Dusk"", ""Doors"") and Jamie Campbell Bower (""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn"", ""New Moon, ""Camelot"").To help people understand what ""Winter in Wartime"" is about, first I must explain the context of where Netherlands was back during World War II.As a neutral country during both World Wars, in 1940, the country was invaded by Nazi Germany.  While the Dutch were able to fight off the Germans, during a time with negotiations between the Dutch and Germans, miscommunication by the Germans led to the accidental bombing of Rotterdam where 950 civilians were killed and the area was devastated.  The Germans used the incident as a way to make the Netherlands surrender and eventually, the Dutch surrendered.During Germany's occupation of Netherlands, the Netherlands was controlled by a German civilian governor and Germany tried to make the country to an Aryan nation and Jews in the country were persecuted, socialists were imprisoned and Roman Catholic priests were deported to concentration camps.Meanwhile, civilians were forced into labor at German factories and food and goods in Netherlands were scarce. So, many Dutch had hatred towards the Germans, a few collaborated with them.Many people were driven away from their homes and because the Germans blocked food and fuel shipments from farm areas, many people starved and people died from ""The Dutch famine of 1944'.""Oorlogswinter"" (Winter in Wartime) is a film about innocence lost because of the war.VIDEO:""Winter in Wartime"" is a film that is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and the cinematography by Guido van Gennep is wonderful.  One of the goals by Martin Koolhoven was to make people feel that they were in the area while watching the film.  Capturing the frigid cold winter in the Netherlands and the cinematography is just beautiful as it showcases the arctic environment but also in HD, showcasing the amazing detail of the clothing, the bark on the trees and also capturing the emotions of the family.It's a film that was well-planned for its sequence and I have to agree with many film critics, ""Winter in Wartime"" is wonderfully crafted and looks absolutely great on Blu-ray!  I saw no banding, no artifacting, no speckles or dirt or any problems at all.  The picture quality is wonderful!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Winter in Wartime"" is presented in Dutch and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  While the film is crystal clear in dialogue, there are some scenes where surround sound usage is well-done, a few scenes with LFE usage as well but it's important to note that the film is primarily dialogue and ambiance driven.There are scenes where you hear the Germans on their motorcycles, the squeaks of Michiel riding his bike, a scene where the ice beneath the bike breaks and shatters and several moments of gunshots and one major plane explosion.  For the most part, this is not a war film in the sense where there is constant action but a war film that focuses on its dramatic elements.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Winter in Wartime"" comes with the following special features:The Making of Winter in Wartime - (24:24) An interview with director Martin Koolhoven and the cast of ""Winter in Wartime"" about their involvement in the film and their thoughts of their character and scenes in the film.Theatrical Trailer - The original theatrical trailer of ""Winter in Wartime.EXTRAS:""Winter in Wartime"" on Blu-ray also comes with a DVD version of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:""Winter in Wartime"" is a powerful film that features beautiful cinematography and a wonderful performance from the young Martijn Lakemeier!When it comes to World War II-era films that are about children, standout films that come to mind are Mike Herman's 1998 film ""The Boy in Striped Pajamas"" and also Roberto Rosselini's 1948 ""Germany, Year Zero"" to name a few.  While the efficacy of both films is the fact that they are though-provoking, especially the latter which was shot not long after the war ended, Martin Koolhoven's ""Winter in Wartime"" gives us a perspective that we really don't see much of, what was happening to the young in Netherlands during German occupation.While Paul Verhoeven's 1977 film ""Soldaat van Oranje"" (Soldier of Orange) is a classic war film that takes place in the Netherlands and my favorite Netherlands World War II film out there, ""Winter in Wartime"" is one that tries to maintain the theme of lost innocence and betrayal.  Where ""Soldier of Orange"" focused on college-aged kids choosing their own path and direction, ""Winter in Wartime"" is a film in which a boy, can't understand this world around him and why the adults would try to make peace with the men who have brought suffering to his country.Too young to understand his father's delicate place in negotiations when it comes to the release of people who get into trouble in their town, but also a boy who looks to his Uncle Ben as the primary source of heroics.  But for those who follow history, especially in the Netherlands and knowing that like other countries who were faced with occupation, one had to make choices for survival.  Hold in your hatred towards the Germans and find a way to fight or join them and become a traitor to your own country and people for the sake of survival or other reasons.For Michiel, anyone who fights against the Germans are heroes to him.  Those who talk and laugh with them are not and thus the resentment he feels towards his father.There are images that we see throughout the film that capture the historical situations of Netherlands quite well.  From those who were forced out of their homes and must walk the frozen terrain looking for food but to see certain people with power who do try to work with the Germans, are in a much better position.Filmmaker Martin Koolhoven tries to capture those situations that he felt as a young boy growing up at that time and brings it to a new generation of audiences who are not familiar with the fears that existed at the time.  In ""Winter of Wartime"", the focus is on innocence and innocence lost.  Although young Michiel gets into trouble and his father has to bail him out, it's not because he's a bad kid but it's because he can't understand why people are to suffer because of the Germans and the fact that he is the mayor's son and never gets into trouble, makes him more confident in pulling off things because of his father's status.  And of course, when many fathers including Michiel's own father are taken as prisoner by the Germans, he quickly learns that his family is not immune and their status in the Netherlands can easily be taken away from them.The film works because of its great cinematography and its performances by its talents.  Primarily the work of main, young actor Martiijn Lakemeier.  To see the transformation of his character of Michiel from the beginning towards the end of the film was done quite well.But while a powerful film that is wonderfully crafted, features wonderful performances and has beautiful cinematography, there was one action scene in the film that pulled me out of the zone.  I just felt that the filmmakers tried to include an action sequence that felt out-of-place.  Something that would seem suitable for an ""Indiana Jones"" type of film and surprisingly, even actor Jamie Campbell Bower used ""Indiana Jones"" as a reference to the scene in the special feature included on the Blu-ray release.But aside from that one scene, the overall film was entertaining and enjoyable.  But its unfortunate that the film was rated R.  If it was because of one or two spoken words of profanity that the film which is based on a novel targeted for young people could have been easily accessible for children.In fact, because of its rating, people may think that this is a violent war film but it's not, especially when compared to other films that are far violent and are given a PG/PG-13 rating.  The film does have a sex scene (nothing is shown), does have a scene of a wounded leg (not graphical at all) and yes, guns shooting at other people but nothing graphic.  This is one of those instances where a film should not have been given an ""R"" rating.As for the Blu-ray release, once again Sony Pictures Classics delivers in PQ and for a film of this type that is a war film but more dialogue and ambiance-driven, the lossless audio works very well for ""Winter in Wartime"".  Special features were more on the short side of this Blu-ray release as only one ""making of"" special feature was included.Recently, Sony Pictures Classics have been including Blu-ray and DVD combo packs of their films which is quite surprising but you know, as long as it's not sold to expensively to consumers, I do like the practice of giving cinema fans the best of both worlds as many movie fans are beginning to migrate from DVD to Blu-ray and by including both, it helps bring more people in watching their films in HD and this is one film that definitely looks wonderful on Blu-ray!Overall, ""Winter in Wartime"" is a film that is powerful and even memorable for its scene and performances.  Fortunately, it's not another ""Soldier of Orange"" (which is a great film) but a film that chooses to find its own path through a country in war through the eyes of a boy.Another solid release from Sony Pictures Classics.

1263007,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B002D303KY,DVD Verdict,"[9, 10]","Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict-- Though Winter in Wartime takes place during WWII, the film hews closer to the suspense/thriller genre. Koolhaven demonstrates a real knack for fusing observant naturalism with immensely polished cinematic technique. That fusion makes for an intriguing viewing experience, as the film frequently shifts gear from an arthouse-like exploration of these people and the world they live in to a brisk, tense thriller. In a way, the intense moments are made more effective by the manner in which they spring forth out of a considerably more sedate film. This is clearly the effort of a top-notch craftsman; don't be surprised if Koolhaven is recruited to helm some sort of American prestige project in the near future.In many ways, Winter in Wartime feels like a WWII movie for the No Country for Old Men era; an emotionally involving but cynical look at the world that wraps everything in aching shades of gray and delivers unsettling catharsis.Winter in Wartime marches onto Blu-ray sporting a very handsome 1080p/2.35:1 transfer. The film's cool, wintry palette (dominated by assorted shades of white, blue and gray) is a pleasure to absorb, and the level of detail is pristine throughout. Blacks are deep and inky, flesh tones are warm and natural and the occasional bursts of bright color are striking. Audio is also impressive, highlighted by a fantastic score courtesy of Italian composer Pino Donaggio. It's such a pleasure to hear the kind of intensely emotional music Donaggio provides; it's similar to and on par with his best work for Brian De Palma thrillers of the 1970s and 1980s (and so many of the film's best moments owe much of their impact to the power of the score). Dialogue (usually Dutch, but sometimes English) is clean and clear and the spare sound design is distributed in an immersive manner.

1263008,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B002D303KY,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","WINTER IN WARTIME (Dir./Writ. Martin Koolhoven, ""OORLOGSWINTER"", 2008, 1 hour 45 minutes, in Dutch, German, English with subtitles, based on the original novel ""Oorlogswinter"" by former Deputy Prime Minister of Holland Jan Terlouw) is a gorgeous, haunting Dutch (Netherlands) film that will assuredly leave you in tears. Many World War II films have inspired audiences in similar ways, but this unique offering will leave you wondering why we didn't get to see it in the U.S. - and why you don't already own the DVD.It is possibly the best WWII film I have ever seen, and stands among the other classics of Europe. Of course there is an American and British zing to this which I find unusual in European film.A handsome, courageous 14-year-old boy, Michiel Van Buesekom (a stunning young Martijn Lakemeier) is handed a note to give to a fellow villager. When the occupying Nazis shoot down the fellow, Michiel reads directions; not far, after he's followed them, he finds a British airman named Jack (the beautiful Jamie Campbell Bower).He's not too shocked - Michiel witnessed Jack's plane crash. What he doesn't see is the Nazi officer Jack is forced to shoot and leave out in the open. In the hide, Michiel helps Jack and gets involved in a courageous tale of the Resistance, treachery and growing up. Michiel's father, Mayor Johan Van Buesekom (a handsome, photogenic Raymond Thiry) has been a disappointment; he curries friendships with the Nazis and keeps the townspeople safe. On the other hand his idol, Uncle Ben (Yorick van Wageningen), is the picture of the stalwart Resistance agent.What we will all learn is that no one is who they seem except young Michiel and Airman Jack. This film is a technical marvel, though I complained about the digital camera being shaken at critical moments, which produced an unnerving effect I have never seen. But the special effects are startling, simple, clean and eye-popping. The suspense is hair-raising, powerful and inspiring!This film is not only a beautiful crafted and acted story, it has one of the most thrilling and unique chase scenes ever devised. Michiel is not your ordinary teenaged boy and shows a determined, dogged heroism that made me weep. Why do we lose out on gems like these?!I've seen my fair share of the best of European film. This is most reminiscent ofIvan's Childhood / Ivanovo Detstvo (1962), though I always say that when I see a war movie with kids in it. This one really matches the technical prowess of the classic CHILDHOOD. Other thanArmy of Shadows (The Criterion Collection)andFlame and Citron, I couldn't think of another film with which to compare it. And I've seen almost all of them.It is so good you'll cry ... I'll guarantee that. The swelling, haunting soundtrack sounds as if John Lennon had written it in heaven expressly for this film. The happy ending will leave you full of the hope for innocence an the hope of the innocent - all the more poignant since we know Michiel will never be innocent again, such is war.Originally intended to be aimed more at a juvenile audience, the director decided to up the ante and thank goodness he did. It has a slight sprinkling of Spielberg in all the best ways, and that only adds to the absolute magic of this effort. No wonder it is one of Holland's most popular films in history. It outshone every other film that year and hasn't sagged in popularity.You're mad as Adolph if you fail to get this movie.

Whether it's Corrie ten Boom (The Hiding Place), Anne Frank, or Brother Andrew (God's Smuggler), there are numerous stories from Holland of those who quietly but effectively stood against tyranny in the last century. ""Winter in Wartime"" is another example of such courage.Michiel is a young Dutch teen living under German occupation in the waning days of World War II. His father, the town mayor, has coexisted with the occupiers through a neutral stance, placating the Nazis the best he can. Michiel feels a growing frustration with his father's attitude, and gets his own chance to prove himself strong when he gets caught up in a Resistance plan to aid a downed British pilot. The pilot is injured, and he has infuriated the Nazis by murdering one of their own. Soon, Michiel is putting himself and his family in danger by helping Jack. Not only does Michiel's sister, a nurse, get emotionally involved, but his father is soon blamed for the murder of the German soldier.As Jack and Michiel wrestle with the implications, and Jack even thinks of turning himself in, Michiel's beloved Uncle Ben steps in with a plan to help. Ben has worked with the Resistance, and he says he knows a way to get Jack to safety. In the end, the entire family suffers the consequences, good and bad, of young Michiel's brave but sometimes foolhardy involvement in the pilot's rescue.Michiel becomes a man, makes manly decisions, and only in the last moments of the film do we get a ray of hope, a hint that maybe some vestige of carefree boyhood remains.

1263010,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002D303KY,Grady Harp,"[6, 6]","WINTER IN WARTIME (Oorlogswinter) is a stunning and intensely involving film that explores the damages war inflicts on all those involved.  It is based on the life of Dutch author Jan Terlouw whose novel by the same name reflects the fact that the author spent five harrowing years under Nazi occupation of Holland in WW II: it has been sensitively and successfully adapted for the screen by Mieke de Jong, Paul Jan Nelissen and writer/director Martin Koolhoven. The title of the film commands every aspect of the story - the colors of a nearly black and white cinematography, the cold atmosphere that intensifies the desperation of war and of coming of age and the bleak aftermath of a war torn country.The time is January 1945. Michiel Van Beusekom (and impressive debut by Martijn Lakemeier) is 13 years old, facing the usual stresses of coming of age accentuated by the fact that his village is occupied by Nazi soldiers.  Michiel's father Johan (Raymond Thiry) is the town's B&uuml;rgermeister (mayor) and attempts to pacify the Nazis whenever possible to protect his town - a fact that Michiel finds disgusting, as though his father was a Nazi sympathizer. Despite this disparity in viewing the atmosphere in the town, Michiel and Johan have a tender relationship as well. There is a crash of a British RAF plane just outside the town and Michiel and his friends inspect the plane, taking souvenirs, and then finding that the pilot Jack (Jamie Campbell Bower - now King Arthur in the television series Camelot) survived but is wounded.  Michiel and Jack become friends and Michiel brings his sister Erica (Melody Klaver) who is a nurse to tend to the leg wound Jack incurred as he parachuted to safety.  Erica and Jack form a relationship beyond nurse/patient status and Jack gives Michiel a package that is to be sent to England.In the midst of the action Michiel's favorite uncle Ben (Yorick van Wageningen) arrives and moves in with the family: he is apparently hiding from the Nazis and becomes Michiel's confidant in his care of the British pilot. Michiel thus becomes a part of the resistance movement and when the Nazis discover a dead comrade (a Nazi killed by Jack when he crashed landed) they intensify their search for traitors.  Michiel works to help Jack escape, but someone must pay for the death of a Nazi soldier and it is the revelation of the family's surprising response that brings the film to a nail-biting close. The secrets of who is honest and who is a traitor become apparent. Michiel has become the hero of the story but at a very high price - the price of human conflict that war demands and receives.The cast is thoroughly solid and it is refreshing to note that the humanistic sides of both the Dutch villagers and the Nazi occupiers are made evident instead of the usual bad guy/good guy stereotypes.  This is another fine movie about WW II and the effects of that heinous time on the youth who survived it.  Highly recommended.  In Dutch and German and English with English subtitles.

1263015,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B002D303KY,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This very good Dutch film takes place during one of the darkest and most cruel moments of modern history of Netherlands - the ""Hongerwinter"" of 1944-45. It is a very interesting look at World War II as seen through the eyes of civilians ans especially one young teenager. I liked it a lot. Below more of my impressions with LIMITED SPOILERS.1. Historical backgroundAfter the partial failure of the operation Market-Garden (17-25 September 1944) and with the necessity for the allies to clear the approaches to Antwerp (Battle of the Scheldt between 2 October and 8 November 1944) before resuming progress further east, it was clear that most of Netherlands would not be liberated before 1945. Therefore, against their previous expectations, the Dutch had to live one more ""winter in wartime""...Their assistance to the allies during the operation Market Garden in September 1944 by sabotage and especially the general strike of raiways workers, brought on Dutch people retaliation by Nazis in form of an embargo on all food transports to still occupied Netherlands. This embargo was lifted only towards the end of November, but at that moment the winter already arrived and the canals were frozen - and with Germans having confiscated virtually every car in the country and most of the horses for their own needs (and keeping all gas for themselves anyway), there was hardly any way to import enough food. Therefore from September 1944 to April 1945 the Dutch lived, as only Western nation in World War II, a real ""Hunger Winter"" with no less than 22 000 people dying from malnourishment and diseases linked to it (and some even of actual starvation, albeit those cases were limited because of strong solidarity). The memory of this time is still very much alive in Netherlands - and even those who were still children then never forgot it. One amongst many others, Audrey Hepburn suffered live long depression most probably because of her memories of ""Hongerwinter""...To hunger and cold were of course added other ""attractions"" usual to life in Nazi-occupied countries, including but not limited to execution of hostages for any kind of act of armed resistance. With many collaborators, including Dutch Nazis, helping occupying forces, the population of Netherlands lived during this winter a genuine nightmare...2. The film""Winter in wartime"" was first a novel written for children and teenagers in 1972 by writer (later also a politician) Jan Terlouw. I didn't read this book, but it seems it is a kind of literary monument in Netherlands - and after seeing this film, which is a faithful adaptation, I can really understand why.The main hero is 16-years old boy named Michiel who hates German occupiers and their Dutch collaborators and would like to do SOMETHING against them, but is prevented in doing so both by his young age and by the strict supervision of his father. The latter, who is also the mayor of the town, tries to avoid any provocation against Germans, so they do not retaliate. Michiel, who has the impatience of his age, despises his father but idolises Ben, his uncle, a mysterious figure who travels a lot around the country, listens frequently to London radio (which is forbidden by the occupiers), carries mysterious objects in his luggage and never says much about his activities. Michiel's older sister, Erica, works as nurse in local hospital. The siblings are not really close - but war will change that...Then one day, Michiel's life changes dramatically, when two things happen almost simultanously: an allied plane (a Mosquito on Pathfinder mission I think) is downed at night and crashes near the town and next morning Dirk, a local boy slightly older than Michiel, gives him a letter to deliver as he fears (deservedly so) that he will not be able to do it himself anymore... I will say no more about the story.3. My impressionsThis is a good solid war time film, rather than a war film, because there is no fighting at all. Instead there is the whole picture of life (and death) in a country under a ruthless foreign occupation: fear, reprisals, lack of food, climate of suspicion, etc. As the occupation is already in its fifth year local population must maintain some kind of contacts with occupiers, no matter how much they are hated - and those contacts are of course very, very awkward. On both sides. There are also traitors, informants and collaborators everywhere - some of them do it because of ideology, some because they are hungry and some, the worst kind, simply because they like to have some power over other people - and hurt them...And then there is the annoying fact that in such a complicated wartime situation few things are REALLY what they look: greatest heroes may hide under the most unlikely disguises - but so can the vilest of the traitors... And when one really wants to live and adventure in such a time, well, he or she probably will - but the price to pay for it can be unimaginable. Finally, there is also the annoying fact, that when one wants to become a warrior, even for the most noble cause, it implies killing people - and even if those people are wicked (or at least serving a bad cause), still the warrior is never the same again.The one thing that can be said against this film, is that it deliberately softens some of the worse issues. Hunger is only suggested here, as are all the things that unavoidably follow (speculation, prostitution, thefts, banditry, people murdered for a piece of bread, etc.) - as well as what EXACTLY happens behind the closed doors of local Gestapo headquarters before people are dragged to execution place... BUT this was NECESSARY, both in the book and in the film, because both were expeced to speak first and above anything else to the young public, to remind them about those times. Therefore I still rate this film five stars.I found this film very impressive and I am glad that I watched it. Recommended viewing for everybody, including children aged 10 and more.",5,A war time film rather than a war movie - but still a darn good watch!,1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,5976,"['very', 'good',

This is a film set in the January of 1945 very near the end of the war in occupied Holland. It tells the story of Michiel (Martijn Lakemeir), the son the towns Mayor. He has a paradoxical relationship with his father, in that he hates him for `working' with the Nazi's but at the same time loves him for being his Dad.One night an RAF plane crashes near to the town, one pilot survives and goes into hiding under the dubious protection of the local resistance, who don't seem too well organised. Michiel then picks up the gauntlet to try to get this English flyer home.The story is not really about war, but choices and good and evil, how in war nothing is cut and dried. The acting in the whole thing is of a particularly high standard. There have been criticisms that a lot of the `action' was signposted. I hate that in films too, but did not feel that to be the case. There are a few plot holes, but that did not spoil my enjoyment of this great little film.This is in Dutch, some German and English with quite good sub titles. I should point out that this is not an action war film, there is no blood and guts battle scenes. So if that is what you are looking for then you should be advised to avoid - big time. It has a run time of 139 minutes and did not drag, I thought it was a very well made, shot and acted tale of morality and of a boy growing up and dealing with the tragedies of War.",4,Great Dutch war story,1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,1493,"['started', 'watching', 'feeling', 'quite', 'tired', 'five', 'minutes', 'was', 'wide', 'awake', 'hooked', 'film', 'set', 'January', '1945', 'very', 'end', 'war', 'occupied', 'Holland', 'story', 'Michiel', 'Martijn', 'Lakemeir', 'son', 'towns', 'Mayor', 'paradoxical', 'relationship', 'father', 'working', 'Nazi', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'Dad.One', 'night', 'RAF', 'plane', 'crashes', 'town', 'one', 'pilot', 'survives', 'hiding', 'dubious', 'protection', 'local', 'resistance', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'well', 'organised', 'Michiel', 'then', 'up', 'gauntlet', 'try', 'get', 'English', 'flyer', 'home.The', 'story', 'not', 'really', 'war', 'choices', 'good', 'evil', 'how', 'war', 'nothing', 'cut', 'dried', 'acting', 'whole', 'thing', 'particularly', 'high', 'standard', 'have', 'been', 'criticisms', 'lot', 'action', 'was', 'signposted', 'hate', 'films', 'too', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'be', 'case', 'are', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'did', 'not', 'spoil', 'enjoyment', 'great', 'little', 'film.This', 'Dutch', 'German', 'English', 'quite', 'good', 'sub', 'titles', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'not', 'action', 'war', 'film', 'blood', 'guts', 'battle', 'scenes', 'So', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'advised', 'avoid', 'big', 'time', 'run', 'time', '139', 'minutes', 'did', 'not', 'drag', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'shot', 'acted', 'tale', 'morality', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'dealing', 'tragedies', 'War']",N/A

After 14 year old Dutch boy Michael (Lakemeier) finds a wounded British soldier during WWII he has to pick a side, resistance or appease the Nazi's. This is a very good coming of age story. It shows how a 14 year old in a war zone is forced to grow up earlier then he should and how he deals with hiding the fact that he is helping ""the enemy"" from everyone, even his family. The title of the movie is deceiving, to me anyway. There is not a typical war movie, in the fact that there is no actual fighting. It is set around a boy and the part of the war that we don't usually see. This is a very good movie, but this is another one that is not for everyone. It is a little slow moving in parts, but as a foreign movie that is expected. The acting by the boy is very very good and at 17 years old looks to have a long career ahead of him. Overall, a very, very well done movie that deserves to be seen. One of the most dramatic war movies I have seen. I like it. I give it a B.Would I watch it again? - I don't think I would, but it was good.*Also try - Enemy At The Gates",4,"A very good coming of age tale about growing up in a war zone.
