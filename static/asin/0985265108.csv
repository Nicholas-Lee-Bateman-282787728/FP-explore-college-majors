Knowing that I have, no doubt, fed this garbage to my family over the years WITHOUT having the CHOICE to NOT do so, angers me beyond belief. We have slowly been moving toward a plant-based, whole foods diet and now it's a done deal - 100%. From this day forward we eat nothing but organic or non-GMO verified foods. I knew about GMO foods, but I did not know how pervasive they are in our food supply. They are, literally, EVERYWHERE - hidden in processed food, without our knowledge.We all must stop buying this poison because it's the only way to stop them from continuing this science experiment on our bodies. The thing that angered me the most in this movie - soy baby formula being made with GMO products (because MOST U.S. soy is GMO)! They are using babies for their SICK and DEMENTED biology experiment! BABIES! Babies who are allergic to milk (probably caused by the disgusting growth hormones injected into the cows to make them produce more milk) have to drink soy based formula and 4 of the Major formula companies use GMO products to make it??? Are you kidding me? It's outrageous. Autism is likely linked to these GMO foods also.I printed out the Non-GMO shopping guide and the Non-GMO VERIFIED companies list on Genetic Roulette's web site and EVERYONE should do the same if you want to avoid these frightening foods. Just Google the movie name and you will find the shopping guide on their site. We need to support the companies that refuse to use GMO prducts.

It is appalling to see how this is decimating our health, our soils, our children, livestock and our future!However, besides revealing the insidious greed that overshadows any impact their lies may have perpetrated, there is a positive side.  We consumers still can vote with our money!  Yes, organic is often more expensive but the flip side is that it is more beneficial to our health.  Wouldn't you rather stop taking pills to ""medicate"" a problem (not heal it) and instead heal or at least lessen a condition caused by the harmful after effects?  I am not a doctor so I will encourage you to watch Medical Doctors on this film state how they have had incredible success treating patients through an organic diet.  It is cheaper to be healthy than spending money on bad food and then take pills (which also have side effects).The film also highlighted those companies, who are committed to being organic are voluntary submitting to 3rd party companies for review and specific approval - similar to the ""Good Housekeeping Seal"".  One of these is the ""Non GMO Project Verified"".

But there are food companies out there who do label there foods and take pride in using non-GMO ingredients. This movie really helped me make the right decisions about what I put in my body.

It's narrated by Lisa Oz (daughter of Dr. Oz) and features interviews with physicians, scientists, farmers, dieticians, chefs and educators all discussing the problems with genetically engineered foods.Americans get sick more often then Europeans and people in other industrial countries and we're getting sicker.  Since the mid 1990's when Genetically Modified Organisms (Genetically Engineered Foods) when our food supply was taken over, without our knowledge or our consent.  The number of Americans suffering at least three chronic illnesses nearly doubled.  Why is this taking place?We've had an epidemic increase in cancer, obesity, allergies, autism, diabetes, asthma, and intestinal disorders.  These are the same conditions that animals eating genetically engineered foods develop in the lab.  It seems like we, and our children, are the guinea pigs of the biotech industry. And contrary to what `industry' states, there are NO long-term safety studies.Genetic Roulette covers everything from the basics, What is a GMO? How are GMOs made? It also has a number of sections on the possible connection of GMOs to Allergies, Autism, Intestinal Damage and Birth Defects.There's also a great section on the California Ballot Initiative - Yes on Prop 37 -that with the support of millions of Californians, will hopefully win in November.There's a second bonus disk with three other short documentaries: Seeds of Freedom (narrated by Jeremy Irons), The Documented Health Risks of Genetically Engineered Foods, The Politics of GMOs and 12 short Public Service announcements.If you eat food this is a must see movie.
