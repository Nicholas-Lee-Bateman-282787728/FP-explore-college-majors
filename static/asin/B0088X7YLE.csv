Darling Companion starts off like a promising film for the first 15 minutes, but once the dog Freeway goes missing...I just truly lost all interest. The only actors that were good in this film were Keaton and Mark Duplass. Everyone else including Kevin Kline, Dianne Weist, and Richard Jenkins were absolutely horrible, and they are usually turn out flawless performances in other films.

As someone active in animal rescue, I was really hooked by the fact the film was about a rescued dog and his affect on his new family. Well, that turned out to be true to a point.There is a charm this film as Beth (Diane Keaton) and her daughter Grace,  played by Elizabeth Moss, rescue a dog from the side of the freeway. Beth's spinal surgeon husband Joseph (Kevin Kline)is not keen on having an addition to the family but everything falls into place. The dog is lovingly named FREEWAY but disappears in the Rockies while the family is celebrating a Grace's wedding at the family vacation home. There is no surprise in who Grace meets and marries.There really is not much of a rescued dog story here. Freeway is only the catalyst for the rest of the story.Adding to mix is Dianne Wiest as Joseph's long-suffering sister Penny who has found love again. Her new love Russell is played by character actor Richard Jenkins. Completing the group is Sam Shephard as the local sheriff. It is delightful to see these ""baby boomer"" actors together in one film. DARLING COMPANION is full of visual splendor thanks to the gorgeous scenery. Unfortuanely the story is rather mediocre version of the mid-life crisis story expect our characters are more in a 2/3 life crisis as they are in their 60's. Joseph and Beth have a loving marriage that has become too routine.Penny is a free-spirit haunted by the fact that her husband left her for another woman. Russell seems to be the man of her dreams but neither Joseph nor her son Bryan approve. Add in one more person, the beautiful and lovely Carmen (Ayelef Zurer), the young and mysterious caretaker of the vacation home who admits to being part gypsy and being able to ""see things."" Carmen becomes the glue that binds them all together as they search for Freeway.We have a great cast in a mediocre film. It seems like Diane Keaton has been in some version of this story in countless movies. Even Carmen, the questionable psychic, could predict how this story will end.

They eat, drink, argue and endure a trauma. At the end, they emerge healed and strong. In ""Darling Companion,"" the precipitating event is the finding of a wounded dog on the side of highway by frazzled wife Diane Keaton. Her husband, uptight surgeon Kevin Kline, doesn't want the dog. Their daughter (Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss) falls for the Indian veterinarian. A wedding and hilarity ensue after the newlyweds head off for their honeymoon and the dog (cutely called ""Freeway"") goes AWOL. Having swept the film clear of all but the warring couples, the time is ripe to hatch the various crises and problems that will show the couples How Much They Love Each Other. It's a great formula, and was good for a few laughs. Kevin Kline's depiction of the hyper-rational (and hugely wrong) male was spot on, a a little too familiar. Keaton was at her dizzy best. Diane Wiest (as Kline's lovelorn sister) brought the film a grounding in true romance.The only curiosity for the all-white cast was the odd insertion of throwaway ethnic characters into the mix.

It's a warm, intimate movie with a truly wonderful ensemble cast, a cute dog and a gorgeous setting. What's not to like? There are some subplots, but the gist of the movie is that Diane Keaton (Beth) and Kevin Kline (Joseph) are in an empty marriage. She rescues a wounded dog near the freeway, and he loses it on a walk while he's on his cell phone as usual, which brings their tension to a head. Diane Weist and Richard Jenkins, lovers whose relationship worries the others, help in the search, along with her son. The part gypsy housekeeper keeps pairing them up in certain ways and telling them her visions of what they are to search for, but what they are really seeking is to understand each other. And that is the heart of the movie.  It is obviously geared for boomers (is that its great sin?), and has some humorous references to growing older which are easily relatable.

1548523,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0088X7YLE,Mark Turner,"[31, 32]","It's been 9 years since director Lawrence Kasdan put out a film, the last being DREAMCATCHER. More than that if you can remember the type of film he is best known for, an ensemble piece that captures the essence of what being human is all about. His classic THE BIG CHILL is but a forgotten memory to some and unknown to a new generation of movie goers. But Kasdan has always excelled at these ensemble pieces and it's nice to see him in true form with DARLING COMPANION.Many will look at the box for this release and think it is nothing more than another animal picture. That does set the stage for this tale but it isn't the main ingredient. Diane Keaton plays Beth, the mother of one daughter Ellie (Lindsay Sloane) who's moved her family to New York and another Grace (Elisabeth Moss) who's in school. After dropping Ellie off at the airport while driving home, Beth tells Grace to stop the car on the freeway. There, they find a wounded and lost dog that they take home. While Beth's husband Joseph (Kevin Kline) insists the dog isn't staying time passes and it's a year later.While the family has grown accustomed to the dog, now named Freeway, a new change is about to kick in. Grace is about to marry the veterinarian they took the dog to when they first found him. The wedding is in the family vacation home on Colorado and goes smoothly. New characters are introduced including Joseph's sister Penny (Dianne Wiest) and her new boyfriend Russell (Richard Jenkins) and housekeeper Carmen (Ayelet Zurer). They are the last remaining guests for the night after the wedding as well as Penny's son and Joseph's fellow back surgeon Bryan (Mark Duplas).With the intent of staying just a few days it all changes when during Joseph loses Freeway while taking him for a walk. Having not taken along the dog's whistle and losing him while talking on his cell phone (something he does constantly), Beth blames him for the loss of the dog which has taken on an extreme amount of importance to her over the past year. Joseph thinks she's over reacting to the dog's loss and that he will come home. Beth thinks Joseph is unfeeling and just wants to ignore his personal responsibilities.All hands join in in the search for Freeway. Things get a bit more interesting when Carmen reveals she is of gypsy descent and has the ability to ""see things"". Following the clues she offers them, each member of the group is paired off and the search goes forward. Along the way each of these characters gets to know the other a little better. Bryan gets to know Russell a bit more as he tries to decide if the man is just after his mother's pension in hopes of building a pub. Bryan and Carmen get close as well. Penny and Russell show that theirs is perhaps the closest relationship in the group. And Beth and Joseph are forced to look back at the choices they've made through the years and to discover that love that they once shared long ago. Has it died or was it simply misplaced over the years?Kasdan has always done a great job with ensemble pieces like this. Both THE BIG CHILL and GRAND CANYON are works that bring together a cast of characters and have them intertwine throughout the story being told, coming together and moving apart, discovering who they really are and who the others around them are and finally realizing the things that are truly important to each of them.Kids of the MTV generation that want answers and want them in five minutes will have a difficult time with this movie. There are no neat and tidy summations in the first 5 minutes or within the first hour of the film. Instead we watch the characters mingle back and forth until the end of the film when the search for Freeway ends either in his loss or discovery. But then to tell you what happens would be to create the worst spoiler ever.Well made and well thought out, this film entertains from start to finish. And above all is some of the best acting around. Keaton remains a fantastic actress and looks amazing. Kline in his sixth film with Kasdan turns in an effortless performance. And the rest of the cast falls in line with these two leads to offer totally believable characters.This is not an action film, a horror film or a teen comedy. This is a movie about real people with real problems who find themselves after having tucked away emotions and ideas for some period of time. As the characters reveal themselves so does the story. It's nice to see a film take the time to speak rather than rush everything.",4,KASDAN STILL HAS THE TOUCH,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,4489,"['been', '9', 'years', 'director', 'Lawrence', 'Kasdan', 'put', 'out', 'film', 'last', 'being', 'DREAMCATCHER', 'More', 'can', 'remember', 'type', 'film', 'best', 'known', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'essence', 'what', 'being', 'human', 'classic', 'THE', 'BIG', 'CHILL', 'forgotten', 'memory', 'unknown', 'new', 'generation', 'movie', 'goers', 'Kasdan', 'always', 'excelled', 'ensemble', 'pieces', 'nice', 'see', 'true', 'form', 'DARLING', 'COMPANION.Many', 'will', 'look', 'box', 'release', 'think', 'nothing', 'more', 'animal', 'picture', 'set', 'stage', 'tale', ""n't"", 'main', 'ingredient', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Beth', 'mother', 'one', 'daughter', 'Ellie', 'Lindsay', 'Sloane', 'who', 'moved', 'family', 'New', 'York', 'Grace', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'who', 'school', 'dropping', 'Ellie', 'off', 'airport', 'driving', 'home', 'Beth', 'Grace', 'stop', 'car', 'freeway', 'find', 'wounded', 'lost', 'dog', 'take', 'home', 'Beth', 'husband', 'Joseph', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'dog', ""n't"", 'staying', 'time', 'passes', 'year', 'family', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'dog', 'now', 'named', 'Freeway', 'new', 'change', 'kick', 'Grace', 'marry', 'veterinarian', 'took', 'dog', 'when', 'first', 'found', 'wedding', 'family', 'vacation', 'home', 'Colorado', 'smoothly', 'New', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'including', 'Joseph', 'sister', 'Penny', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Russell', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'housekeeper', 'Carmen', 'Ayelet', 'Zurer', 'are', 'last', 'remaining', 'guests', 'night', 'wedding', 'as', 'well', 'Penny', 'son', 'Joseph', 'fellow', 'back', 'surgeon', 'Bryan', 'Mark', 'Duplas', '.With', 'intent', 'staying', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'changes', 'when', 'Joseph', 'Freeway', 'taking', 'walk', 'Having', 'not', 'taken', 'dog', 'whistle', 'losing', 'talking', 'cell', 'phone', 'something', 'constantly', 'Beth', 'loss', 'dog', 'taken', 'extreme', 'amount', 'importance', 'past', 'year', 'Joseph', 'reacting', 'dog', 'loss', 'will', 'come', 'home', 'Beth', 'Joseph', 'unfeeling', 'just', 'ignore', 'personal', 'responsibilities.All', 'hands', 'join', 'search', 'Freeway', 'Things', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'Carmen', 'gypsy', 'descent', 'ability', 'see', 'things', 'Following', 'clues', 'member', 'group', 'paired', 'off', 'search', 'forward', 'way', 'characters', 'know', 'other', 'little', 'better', 'Bryan', 'know', 'Russell', 'bit', 'more', 'decide', 'man', 'just', 'mother', 'pension', 'hopes', 'building', 'pub', 'Bryan', 'Carmen', 'get', 'close', 'as', 'well', 'Penny', 'Russell', 'show', 'perhaps', 'closest', 'relationship', 'group', 'Beth', 'Joseph', 'are', 'forced', 'look', 'back', 'choices', ""'ve"", 'made', 'years', 'discover', 'love', 'once', 'shared', 'long', 'ago', 'died', 'was', 'simply', 'misplaced', 'years', 'Kasdan', 'always', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'ensemble', 'pieces', 'THE', 'BIG', 'CHILL', 'GRAND', 'CANYON', 'are', 'bring', 'together', 'cast', 'characters', 'have', 'intertwine', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'coming', 'together', 'moving', 'apart', 'discovering', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'who', 'others', 'are', 'finally', 'realizing', 'things', 'are', 'truly', 'important', 'them.Kids', 'MTV', 'generation', 'want', 'answers', 'want', 'five', 'minutes', 'will', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'movie', 'are', 'neat', 'tidy', 'summations', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'Instead', 'watch', 'characters', 'mingle', 'back', 'forth', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'search', 'Freeway', 'loss', 'discovery', 'then', 'tell', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'create', 'worst', 'spoiler', 'ever.Well', 'made', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'best', 'acting', 'around', 'Keaton', 'fantastic', 'actress', 'amazing', 'Kline', 'sixth', 'film', 'Kasdan', 'effortless', 'performance', 'rest', 'cast', 'line', 'two', 'leads', 'offer', 'totally', 'believable', 'characters.This', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'horror', 'film', 'teen', 'comedy', 'movie', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'problems', 'who', 'find', 'having', 'tucked', 'away', 'emotions', 'ideas', 'period', 'time', 'characters', 'reveal', 'so', 'story', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'take', 'time', 'speak', 'rather', 'rush', 'everything']",N/A

1548526,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0088X7YLE,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","For the life of me I can't remember why I wanted to watch this movie.  I suspect the cast had me intrigued.  It certainly couldn't have been because of favorable reviews as the film has been blasted by both critics and theater goers (grossed &lt; $1 million).  So let me provide a tepid defense of the film.The story centers on a well-to-do couple and their family.  Diane Keaton plays Beth and is married to a back surgeon, Joseph - not Joe - (Kevin Kline).  Beth is out with her daughter Grace (Elisabeth Moss) when they spot a large dog on a hill next to the freeway.  Circling back, they warm up to the dog, take him to a hunky vet (Jay Ali) and get him fixed up.  Named Freeway, the dog is a great companion to Beth and Joseph, essentially has come to tolerate the dog.  As long as he doesn't interfere with his medical practice.The family gathers at their second home, a ski lodge near Denver, for the wedding of Grace who yep, marries the vet that fixed up Freeway.  While taking a walk with Joseph, Freeway gets away chasing after a deer and cannot be found.  The reality is that Freeway is just an excuse for Lawrence Kasdan, who directed and co-wrote the script with his wife Meg, to let the grown-ups come together and solve their marital issues.  In addition to Beth and Joseph, others in the collective must come to grips with each other as well.There's Joseph's sister Penny (Dianne Wiest) who is about to marry gadfly Russell (Richard Jenkins) much to the dismay of her son and Joseph's nephew and medical partner Bryan (Mark Duplass).  Bryan gets a fix on the housekeeper, Carmen (Ayelet Zurer) who is a gypsy and seer.  Then there is Sam Shepard as the local bumpkin sheriff.Now make no mistake, this isn't a great movie.  It is ponderously slow at times.  There is no question as to the outcome.  And there are ridiculous events and circumstances that make absolutely no sense.  But then again, there is just enough humor, warmth to make it palatable.  And it's fun to watch talented actors take marginal material and make something out of it.  I suspect this film will find an audience on disc.I have no complaints about the Blu ray transfer that I watched.  The 1080p resolution comes with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 and it looks tremendous.

It was while viewing that film that I first fell in love with this type of movie, along with the personal stamp he adds to it.  Bring out the 'baby boomers' ...Beth Winter (Diane Keaton) and her daughter Grace discover a wounded dog along the freeway and quickly stop to get it help.  After learning that the Animal Control Dept. would only 'put him down', the two women are upset and take him on to the vet. Of course, Beth does end up taking the 7 yr old dog home and naming him ""Freeway"" immediately ... At first, her husband Joseph (Kevin Kline) balks at the idea then slowly complies realizing his wife's obvious attachment.""The Thing Called Love"" (Bonnie Raitt) plays out from the soundtrack as the family starts to fall in love with Freeway and meshes with their new pet.  The movie quickly skips ahead one year to the couple's vacation home in Colorado.  Their daughter marries the vet that got Freeway back into shape and a whole cast of interesting characters enters the scene.  The scenery in CO is gorgeous, lush and colorful. Photography (Michael McDonough) of this beautiful area could not be better represented.  Everything to the slightest detail comes alive and breathes life into the couples that stay behind after the wedding day.Joseph's sister Penny (Dianne Wiest) brings along her new love interest, Russell (Richard Jenkins).  Along with them is her son Bryan (Mark Duplass), a fellow surgeon along with Joseph.  A very intuitive person added to the cast is the insightful caretaker of the vacation home, Carmen (Ayelet Zurer - ""Hide Away"").  Shortly after everyone is there, Joseph unintentionally loses Freeway while taking him out on a walk.  The entire group gets together, in many ways, and outsources to find the dog.  The sheriff (Sam Shepard) of the town is also sought out to help and adds his own regional flavor to the search party.This is a simple set up for this plot, as the movie does stay relatively  simple and that is exactly why I liked it so well.  There are several other interests like the couple's now 'empty-nest' marriage which has become too ordinary for them.  It is obvious that Beth and Joseph love each other very much after all these years and need a new connection for themselves as a couple.  Some focus is unto the subplots, if you will, although the major portion of the movie is concentrated on finding this dog and a soul seeking quest to return him home.  Beth is so emotionally tied to Freeway and is heartbroken by him being gone.  Their relationship represents so many things to and about her life in the fuller sense.The people taking stake in getting Freeway returned are also taking their own personal journeys at this time in their lives. Full of self-reflection, this is a highly emotional story in parts. One that doesn't beg its own attention and also any animal lover would appreciate this lovely story.  Done with nothing offensive; I think that this would make an age-appropriate 'family movie' ...
