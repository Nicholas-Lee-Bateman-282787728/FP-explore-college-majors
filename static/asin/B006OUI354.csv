She seems really ditsy, but she is quite brilliant at what she does, well, until she decideds to tell a huge lie to a woman who stole the love of her life. I say, thank goodness she did. What developes and unfolds is far better than the lawyer, former boyfriend. He changes in the series too. The wealthy business man she draws into her lie, gorgeous and he knows it. Arrogant and he knows it. A good heart he wants nobody to know about. Vulnerable which he hides. This is a sweet story. A single dad who raised a really good daughter wanting to make her dad proud of her. It also shows what can happen when politics mix into ones personal life. Quick false judgements. I think you will like this one too. I would say my favorite part of the series starts with the new use for Coca Cola....whoa, really great!",5,This series was really fun.

You laugh and cry as with most K-Dramas. I fell for this one for the reason that there really wasn't any villians in this story.Where there was a lot of manipulation and backstabbing.

1518353,A1YCV76MUFESR1,B006OUI354,Anne-Marie G,"[18, 21]","The story starts with Ah-jung running into an old frenemy, So-ran. So-ran married the man that Ah-jung considers her first love. So-ran did so knowingly and upon seeing Ah-jung again, after three years, rubs it in her face. Ah-jung to save face pretends she is married.  It snowballs however because she is later seen with Ki-joon and the insane gossip mill in this show marries her to him.Eventually the pair draw up a contract to maintain the appearance of a marriage for a month.Ki-joon has no idea how attracted to Ah-jung he is, it is pretty cute to watch. He has a great support staff too.(Two totally under-developed characters in this drama, me thinks, his secretary and a female bestfriend/ CEO of his company.)Hijinks ensue.This drama has a few things going for it.Yoon Eun Hye is always so much fun to watch.  It was nice to see her in a role as a mature woman and not the girl ofPalaceor the gender-bender inThe 1st Shop of Coffee Prince.  She reminds me of Sarah Michelle Gellar inBuffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Series.  Both women are so great at pulling the audience into feeling what their characters are feeling. Plus there is some wonderful physical acting going on in this show (though Yoon's has been toned down a bit compared to some of her other antics).This is my first time seeing Kang Ji-hwan in anything, however, I'm hoping it isn't the last. I really enjoyed him. His character was all over the place, as the stuff upper lip businessman and the smitten lover.The chemistry between these two leads was amazing and the story pretty much road on the coattails of that chemistry. (which I am mostly okay with).  There were times when smoke might have been coming out of my screen. This drama is worth watching for the awesome 'cola-kiss,' if nothing else. It is a moment that goes from totally cute and funny to serious and steamy, not to mention the camera work and direction in that scene are great.The drama also has some great secondary characters. It has one of the best father-daughter relationships I've seen in a K-drama. The younger brother, Sang-hee, is pretty fun to watch in his earlier scenes and then gets sort of dragged down into melo-drama land, but it was nice to see him growing up a bit.Unfortunately the story just sort of looses itself towards the end and characters have all sorts of reversals just to inject some ""Dramatic tension"" into the whole thing. Really, if they  had just had cute frolicky dates I would have been a happy viewer. Instead the writers watered down the quality of the whole show with how they handled how to wrap things up. The tried and true: ""I love you but I can't marry you...yet. I need to go far away and think and be tortured for a few episodes.""I didn't hate it, and parts of it are really worth rewatching, the middle few episodes where they are happily dating after the lie is exposed and before DRAMA happens. It could have been leaps and bounds better, considering how enjoyable seeing these two leads were I can't imagine how addicting the show could have been if it had been better written and plotted.

It was so enjoyable to watch how these two lives slowly changed due to one little slip up.As far as favorites, for KDramas, this would be in my top 10 or so. For those of you who like romantic comedy, I would recommend this one and several others.  Yoon Eun Hye is fantastic also in Palace and First Shop of Coffee Prince.

Glad I did.  It's become one of my favorite lite entertainment dvds.  There is a lot of chemistry between Yoon Eun Hye and Kang Ji Hwan, and the soundtrack has a couple of great tunes on it.  Of course the Cola kiss scene is great, in fact this kdrama really bends the staid boundaries on kissing on screen.  Its a nice change, without it getting overdone.  The supporting cast was great, and the story silly but showed how lies, jealousy, avarice, and greed all lead to a slippery slope if you aren't careful.

If it had gone the all-out comedy route, like Seinfeld - a lie leads to another lie, clueless side-characters propagate the confusions even further and things go out of control - it would have been great. Instead after the promising initial setup, it just goes the same-old-Korean-soap route: persistent and manipulative old flame comes back from a foreign country (at least it is not US this time. It is France!), a disapproving mother figure intervenes, so on and so forth. There is not much development in sub-plots and side-characters either.The actors are all attractive, especially Yun Un-Hye, and it could have been a whole lot better but instead it just feels like yet another recycled story.

What was most striking was the unusual story line, which was as funny as it was comical. The two lead characters were very well matched and both gave a delightful performance, the supporting cast did not dissappoint. The important life lesson here being -""what a tangle web we weave when first we choose to deceive""- this was very aptly depicted in Lie to me. To untangle the web of lies required humility and in this case a healthy dose of love and affection. It helped that in the course of the pretence and lies, cupid's arrow had made its mark on the two and this made for a very entertaining series.
