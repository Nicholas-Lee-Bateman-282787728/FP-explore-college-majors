The thing I liked the best about it was that even though I was in my 30s, had never done yoga before, and had never been very flexible, I could do ALL of the postures.  Of course, my form wasn't always perfect and I did have to modify at times, but at least I was able to approximate the basic poses, which I found very gratifying. Instructor Patricia Walden does use props, but I found that I could make do without or by using substitutions (e.g., a thick book instead of a yoga block).One caution about this video is that it definitely moves slowly, as Patricia takes quite a bit of time for instruction in-between each posture.  Because of this, it's probably best viewed as an instructional video rather than a complete yoga practice.  I also found Patricia's instruction style to be rather dry (although I didn't find her condescending as some others have mentioned).  Once I became more familiar with the postures, I usually fast-forward past Patricia's instruction, and eventually, as I progressed further, I got rid of this video altogether.  Although there are many more options for those new to yoga available today, I still think this is a solid foundation that can serve as a good place to begin your yoga journey.",4,Worked well for me when I was just starting out,1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,1389,"['2001', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'many', 'yoga', 'options', 'market', 'are', 'today', 'wanted', 'try', 'yoga', 'video', 'seemed', 'liked', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'thing', 'liked', 'best', 'was', 'even', 'was', '30s', 'had', 'never', 'done', 'yoga', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'very', 'flexible', 'could', 'do', 'postures', 'course', 'form', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'perfect', 'did', 'have', 'modify', 'times', 'least', 'was', 'able', 'approximate', 'basic', 'poses', 'found', 'very', 'gratifying', 'Instructor', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'use', 'props', 'found', 'could', 'make', 'do', 'using', 'substitutions', 'e.g.', 'thick', 'book', 'instead', 'yoga', 'block', '.One', 'caution', 'video', 'definitely', 'slowly', 'Patricia', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'instruction', 'in-between', 'posture', 'probably', 'best', 'viewed', 'instructional', 'video', 'rather', 'complete', 'yoga', 'practice', 'also', 'found', 'Patricia', 'instruction', 'style', 'be', 'rather', 'dry', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'condescending', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Once', 'became', 'more', 'familiar', 'postures', 'usually', 'fast-forward', 'past', 'Patricia', 'instruction', 'eventually', 'progressed', 'further', 'got', 'rid', 'video', 'altogether', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'options', 'new', 'yoga', 'available', 'today', 'still', 'think', 'solid', 'foundation', 'can', 'serve', 'good', 'place', 'begin', 'yoga', 'journey']",N/A

I have advanced arthritis in my neck and also have recently corrected a scoliosis curve in my spine. My sister, who is trained in yoga instruction and who has traveled extensively studying Iyengar yoga, recommended Patricia Walden to me. I am SO GLAD she did! There are sequences of just poses and no instruction, and plenty of slow instruction on each pose so thorough that you do not need to look at the video (just like an Iyengar class!). Also, her technique is gorgeous. Watching her the way they filmed her, you can see her spine moving, her muscles adjusting, so you get the reinforcement of always shifting in the poses, to increase your body awareness and your understanding as you relearn and master each pose, each day. The reviewers who don't like how it was filmed obviously didn't realize that was clearly the purpose. Also, her voice is slow and hypnotic, not fake at all. Just controlled. The reviewers who were negative on her voice maybe haven't experienced the Iyengar style which is to constantly remind us of what we need to be paying attention to when we're in the pose, so we don't get lazy in any of the postures.",5,Like taking an intro series at Iyengar!,1225584000,"11 2, 2008",2008,1240,"['studied', 'yoga', 'New', 'York', 'Iyengar', 'yoga', 'center', 'several', 'years', 'love', 'going', 'back', 'basics', 'have', 'advanced', 'arthritis', 'neck', 'also', 'have', 'recently', 'corrected', 'scoliosis', 'curve', 'spine', 'sister', 'who', 'trained', 'yoga', 'instruction', 'who', 'traveled', 'extensively', 'studying', 'Iyengar', 'yoga', 'recommended', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'am', 'SO', 'GLAD', 'did', 'are', 'sequences', 'just', 'poses', 'instruction', 'plenty', 'slow', 'instruction', 'pose', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'look', 'video', 'just', 'Iyengar', 'class', 'Also', 'technique', 'gorgeous', 'Watching', 'way', 'filmed', 'can', 'see', 'spine', 'moving', 'muscles', 'adjusting', 'get', 'reinforcement', 'always', 'shifting', 'poses', 'increase', 'body', 'awareness', 'understanding', 'relearn', 'master', 'pose', 'day', 'reviewers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'was', 'filmed', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'clearly', 'purpose', 'Also', 'voice', 'slow', 'hypnotic', 'not', 'fake', 'Just', 'controlled', 'reviewers', 'who', 'were', 'negative', 'voice', 'maybe', 'have', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'Iyengar', 'style', 'constantly', 'remind', 'what', 'need', 'be', 'paying', 'attention', 'when', ""'re"", 'pose', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lazy', 'postures']",N/A

A true beginner, especially a person who has not yet otherwise been exposed to yoga and is just trying a home video ""to see,"" really needs instruction that will emphasize body awareness to protect his or her still-stiff, untoned body from injury. Which is where Walden's DVD becomes extremely useful.Even though Patricia Walden does take the full pose in the basic poses offered in this DVD, her instructions teach the physical experience of yoga specifically for beginners. She does not assume that her viewers will be able to move from one pose to another with the kind of awareness and synchronized breathing that is really required for the flow sequences or vinyasas that are so popular today. Instead, she teaches viewers how to be aware of their internal and external physical state and how to challenge it constructively using breathing techniques and the poses themselves. Her instruction is deliberate and slow, so that the viewer will learn the key elements of alignment and awareness while moving into each pose offered. These elements are the backbone of any yoga practice and the best way to prevent against injury precisely because one learns to sense just how deeply to take a particular pose.And beginners will find this DVD physically challenging, provided that they do the poses with their full attention and practice regularly rather than once in a while.If you're in good physical shape, are FLEXIBLE (i.e., can touch your forehead to your knees while keeping your back straight), and hoping to have a good, hard workout with some great home video, then you're bound to be disappointed by this DVD - it just wasn't made with you in mind. If you're looking to learn the basic poses, how body awareness feels inside-out, and basic breathing techniques, consider this DVD a MUST. If you're out of shape and want to get back into yoga and/or strengthen your joints with instruction, then I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD as a way back to the basics.",5,Learn the true essentials of yoga with Walden rather than just poses and flow,1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,2109,"['Too', 'few', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'teach', 'beginners', 'how', 'NOT', 'overexert', 'too', 'many', 'poses', 'too', 'shallow', 'breathing', 'too', 'little', 'body', 'awareness', 'true', 'beginner', 'especially', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'otherwise', 'been', 'exposed', 'yoga', 'just', 'trying', 'home', 'video', 'see', 'really', 'instruction', 'will', 'emphasize', 'body', 'awareness', 'protect', 'still-stiff', 'untoned', 'body', 'injury', 'Which', 'where', 'Walden', 'DVD', 'extremely', 'useful.Even', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'take', 'full', 'pose', 'basic', 'poses', 'offered', 'DVD', 'instructions', 'teach', 'physical', 'experience', 'yoga', 'specifically', 'beginners', 'not', 'assume', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'move', 'one', 'pose', 'kind', 'awareness', 'synchronized', 'breathing', 'really', 'required', 'flow', 'sequences', 'vinyasas', 'are', 'so', 'popular', 'today', 'Instead', 'viewers', 'how', 'be', 'aware', 'internal', 'external', 'physical', 'state', 'how', 'challenge', 'constructively', 'using', 'breathing', 'techniques', 'poses', 'instruction', 'deliberate', 'slow', 'viewer', 'will', 'learn', 'key', 'elements', 'alignment', 'awareness', 'moving', 'pose', 'offered', 'elements', 'are', 'backbone', 'yoga', 'practice', 'best', 'way', 'prevent', 'injury', 'precisely', 'one', 'sense', 'just', 'how', 'deeply', 'take', 'particular', 'pose.And', 'beginners', 'will', 'find', 'DVD', 'physically', 'challenging', 'provided', 'do', 'poses', 'full', 'attention', 'practice', 'regularly', 'rather', 'once', 'while.If', ""'re"", 'good', 'physical', 'shape', 'are', 'FLEXIBLE', 'i.e.', 'can', 'touch', 'forehead', 'knees', 'keeping', 'back', 'straight', 'hoping', 'have', 'good', 'hard', 'workout', 'great', 'home', 'video', 'then', ""'re"", 'bound', 'be', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'mind', ""'re"", 'looking', 'learn', 'basic', 'poses', 'how', 'body', 'awareness', 'feels', 'inside-out', 'basic', 'breathing', 'techniques', 'consider', 'DVD', 'MUST', ""'re"", 'shape', 'want', 'get', 'back', 'yoga', 'and/or', 'strengthen', 'joints', 'instruction', 'then', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'way', 'back', 'basics']",N/A
