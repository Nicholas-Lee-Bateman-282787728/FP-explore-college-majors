I felt stronger and tighter while I was doing it, and the girls' bubbly personalities makes the experience more pleasant (as compared to the boot camp severity of Jillian Michaels). I've been doing a mix of cardio and toning workouts 3-4x/wk for the past 6 months and this whooped my behind! There were a few exercises I just flat out could not do. However, they bring the best out of you because there were several other moves that looked intimidating, but I was able to complete (even if it was a lesser number of reps). If you're trying to kick up your routine a notch, rotating in one or both of these workouts will definitely get you results if you stick with it. Warning: Do NOT attempt this DVD if you have not been consistently exercising for at least a few months. Also, there are a lot of squats, lunges and plyometrics in the first workout so it isn't kind to those with knee problems.",5,Hardcore but accessible workout,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,989,"['have', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'DVD', 'love', 'definitely', 'results', 'felt', 'stronger', 'tighter', 'was', 'doing', 'girls', 'bubbly', 'personalities', 'experience', 'more', 'pleasant', 'compared', 'boot', 'camp', 'severity', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'mix', 'cardio', 'toning', 'workouts', '3-4x/wk', 'past', '6', 'months', 'whooped', 'behind', 'were', 'few', 'exercises', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'However', 'bring', 'best', 'were', 'several', 'other', 'moves', 'looked', 'intimidating', 'was', 'able', 'complete', 'even', 'was', 'lesser', 'number', 'reps', ""'re"", 'trying', 'kick', 'up', 'routine', 'notch', 'rotating', 'one', 'workouts', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'results', 'stick', 'Warning', 'Do', 'NOT', 'attempt', 'DVD', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'consistently', 'exercising', 'least', 'few', 'months', 'Also', 'are', 'lot', 'squats', 'lunges', 'plyometrics', 'first', 'workout', ""n't"", 'kind', 'knee', 'problems']",Tone It Up!

1384730,AGNLERMXPZ1UD,B00443BJ7W,Jules B.,"[0, 0]","So, the video seems a bit amateurish & the girls sometimes seem immature.  But by the time I finished &#8230; I was drenched.  It was a different type of routine than I was used to.  (I am comfortable doing the tabata style workouts by Amy Dixon & also use other high-impact type workouts).The warm-up is a bit boring & longer than expected, but thorough.  I was concerned it was a reflection of the whole workout.  They subtly ramp up the workout without you even realizing it.The DVD has (2) slightly different 30 min workouts &#8230; which is nice for variety.I mentioned that the girls seem immature &#8230; the one girl in particular, flips her hair a lot & giggles a lot.  It could be just nervousness, but it comes off wrong.  However, the girls share good knowledge & insight throughout the routines.I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone.  I will definitely look into purchasing more of their dvds.  I was ultimately impressed.",5,Wow!,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,941,"['So', 'video', 'bit', 'amateurish', 'girls', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'immature', 'time', 'finished', '8230', 'was', 'drenched', 'was', 'different', 'type', 'routine', 'was', 'used', 'am', 'comfortable', 'doing', 'tabata', 'style', 'workouts', 'Amy', 'Dixon', 'also', 'use', 'other', 'high-impact', 'type', 'workouts', '.The', 'warm-up', 'bit', 'boring', 'longer', 'expected', 'was', 'concerned', 'was', 'reflection', 'whole', 'workout', 'subtly', 'ramp', 'up', 'workout', 'even', 'realizing', 'it.The', 'DVD', '2', 'slightly', 'different', '30', 'min', 'workouts', '8230', 'nice', 'variety.I', 'mentioned', 'girls', 'seem', 'immature', '8230', 'one', 'girl', 'particular', 'hair', 'lot', 'lot', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'nervousness', 'off', 'wrong', 'However', 'girls', 'share', 'good', 'knowledge', 'insight', 'routines.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'anyone', 'will', 'definitely', 'look', 'purchasing', 'more', 'dvds', 'was', 'ultimately', 'impressed']",Tone It Up!

I did find the workout a little on the easy side so if you are intermediate to advance level in fitness this might a little easy.

1384733,A3K18T9IP0UEKP,B00443BJ7W,P Sims,"[35, 37]","I absolutely love this DVD! After reading the reviews, I thought the workouts would be way too easy for my intermediate/advanced level - wrong!  Each move is done for 50-60 seconds and completed twice so you WILL feel the burn and you WILL sweat!Katrina and Karena's instruction is very conversational and their playful banter makes you feel like you're working out with your girlfriends. They each take turns demonstrating the moves while the other one explains form. You can tell Katrina is more comfortable in front of the camera and it shows in her delivery. I thought she was more knowledgeable as far as the specific muscles each exercise was working and her cueing was more on point than Karena's - when Karena was leading I was constantly glancing up at the TV because her instructions weren't clear enough to allow me to just focus on doing the moves.There are two workouts and they are each about 30 minutes. Workout #1 is a full body interval-based workout - burpees, lunges with and without weights, jump squats, planks, plank jacks, reverse flys. Workout #2 focuses on the abs and glutes and uses no weights - high knees, oblique crunches, backward lunges, tuck jumps, pli&eacute; curtsy lunges, plank side hops, seated bicycles, bridge with a leg adduction, side plank raises, etc.Overall this is a very good workout and my new favorite.",5,My new favorite!,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,1351,"['absolutely', 'love', 'DVD', 'reading', 'reviews', 'thought', 'workouts', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'too', 'easy', 'intermediate/advanced', 'level', 'wrong', 'move', 'done', '50-60', 'seconds', 'completed', 'twice', 'so', 'WILL', 'feel', 'burn', 'WILL', 'sweat', 'Katrina', 'Karena', 'instruction', 'very', 'conversational', 'playful', 'banter', 'feel', ""'re"", 'working', 'out', 'girlfriends', 'take', 'turns', 'demonstrating', 'moves', 'other', 'one', 'form', 'can', 'tell', 'Katrina', 'more', 'comfortable', 'front', 'camera', 'delivery', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'knowledgeable', 'as', 'far', 'specific', 'muscles', 'exercise', 'was', 'working', 'cueing', 'was', 'more', 'point', 'Karena', 'when', 'Karena', 'was', 'leading', 'was', 'constantly', 'glancing', 'up', 'TV', 'instructions', 'were', ""n't"", 'clear', 'enough', 'allow', 'just', 'focus', 'doing', 'moves.There', 'are', 'two', 'workouts', 'are', '30', 'minutes', 'Workout', '1', 'full', 'body', 'interval-based', 'burpees', 'lunges', 'weights', 'jump', 'squats', 'planks', 'plank', 'jacks', 'reverse', 'flys', 'Workout', '2', 'focuses', 'abs', 'glutes', 'weights', 'high', 'knees', 'oblique', 'crunches', 'backward', 'lunges', 'tuck', 'jumps', 'pli', 'eacute', 'curtsy', 'lunges', 'plank', 'side', 'hops', 'seated', 'bicycles', 'bridge', 'leg', 'adduction', 'side', 'plank', 'etc.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'workout', 'new', 'favorite']",Tone It Up!
