The writers strike may have been a cause for this series to be cancelled, and this 2nd season is fairly bare bones. I am hearing impaired, and very disappointed it was released without any subtitles, as found on Season 1. It is NOT just for deaf people, and we SHOULD be considered. It is a very minor thing to add a small text track to a disc, and I feel like they JUST DON&#34;T CARE when it is left off. It is also very valuable to those who speak English as a 2nd language, and also helps if you just can't catch all of the fast paced dialogue. I wish everyone who CARES about this issue would say so in reviews, and hes - write letters to production companies and get vocal about it.",4,Sorry this show was cancelled...,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,796,"['second', 'season', 'up', 'lot', 'questions', 'interesting', 'story', 'lines', 'spoilers', 'here', 'writers', 'strike', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'cause', 'series', 'be', 'cancelled', '2nd', 'season', 'fairly', 'bare', 'bones', 'am', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'very', 'disappointed', 'was', 'released', 'subtitles', 'found', 'Season', '1', 'NOT', 'just', 'deaf', 'people', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'considered', 'very', 'minor', 'thing', 'add', 'small', 'text', 'track', 'disc', 'feel', 'JUST', 'DON', '34', 'T', 'CARE', 'when', 'left', 'off', 'also', 'very', 'valuable', 'who', 'speak', 'English', '2nd', 'language', 'also', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'catch', 'fast', 'paced', 'dialogue', 'wish', 'everyone', 'who', 'issue', 'would', 'say', 'so', 'reviews', 'hes', 'write', 'letters', 'production', 'companies', 'get', 'vocal']",N/A
