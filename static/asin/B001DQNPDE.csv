She has a phenomenal teaching style and her youtube videos were always excellent and extremely thorough. I always wondered why she didn't have a DVD out and then I found her Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga Power Hour! It was just released this year and I have to say, it is excellent!!! I think this is appropriate for beginners, intermediate or advanced yoga students. It really concentrates on and builds your core which is very important in yoga (and one of the areas where I am still a little weak). I can really feel my abs working during the DVD and definitely the next day! It moves at a nice pace, not too slow and not too fast. I am dripping in sweat after 60 minutes and I've been doing yoga for 2 years! It's a great workout!",5,Excellent vinyasa DVD,1223251200,"10 6, 2008",2008,810,"['was', 'first', 'introduced', 'Sadie', 'Nardini', 'excellent', 'youtube', 'yoga', 'videos', 'phenomenal', 'teaching', 'style', 'youtube', 'videos', 'were', 'always', 'excellent', 'extremely', 'thorough', 'always', 'wondered', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'DVD', 'out', 'then', 'found', 'Core', 'Strength', 'Vinyasa', 'Yoga', 'Power', 'Hour', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'year', 'have', 'say', 'excellent', 'think', 'appropriate', 'beginners', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'yoga', 'students', 'really', 'builds', 'core', 'very', 'important', 'yoga', 'one', 'areas', 'where', 'am', 'still', 'little', 'weak', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'abs', 'working', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'next', 'day', 'nice', 'pace', 'not', 'too', 'slow', 'not', 'too', 'fast', 'am', 'dripping', 'sweat', '60', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', '2', 'years', 'great', 'workout']",Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga Power Hour with Sadie Nardini

This video focuses on core strength and conditioning.  Reminds me of some of the yoga in P90X: not for sissies or weaklings who just want to use yoga to relax. This lady will work you hard if you follow along! Although she starts you off in lotus with some breathing exercises, she then transitions into challenging movements and poses which are also fast-paced and will lead to a significant burn.

1182973,AHRCY5M1ZBW52,B001DQNPDE,Sooperbonbon,"[2, 2]","I wanted to be guided through a yoga practice and instead I got a new age exercise routine. It's a good workout.  It starts with a pilates core series on the floor rather than the typical vinyasa tadasana/uttanasana/chatturanga/up dog/downdog series.  Every pose is turned into an exercise, as opposed to pausing and working in the pose.  I often don't do the internal movements she describes and stay in the initial pose.She uses phrases like 'offer your heart&#34; instead of &#34;open your chest&#34;, and 'wave&#34; instead of &#34;push back&#34;, so I had to keep looking to see what she meant.But despite the language, it's not spiritual; there's no meditation, no shivasana, no dharma. No inversions, or very mild ones, because inversions require not moving, so they don't contribute to the exercise function. Also not alot of work leading up to poses (the best yoga classes I take work on triangle, say,  for about 10 minutes, using different small variations in the exercise to deepen the twist, open the shoulder, activate that standing leg, etc.). She starts handstand with the jump practice, when a half handstand with feet on the wall is a much better way to start to build the shoulder, arm and core strength you need.I'd characterize this as an intermediate to advanced level core workout---it's fast, and assumes flexibility and some experience with yoga. If you are looking to strengthen your core and get a pretty good workout in an hour, do it! If you want help building a home yoga practice, probably not for you.",3,yoga-inspired exercise,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,1533,"['wanted', 'be', 'guided', 'yoga', 'practice', 'instead', 'got', 'new', 'age', 'exercise', 'routine', 'good', 'workout', 'pilates', 'core', 'series', 'floor', 'rather', 'typical', 'vinyasa', 'tadasana/uttanasana/chatturanga/up', 'dog/downdog', 'series', 'Every', 'pose', 'turned', 'exercise', 'opposed', 'pausing', 'working', 'pose', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'internal', 'movements', 'stay', 'initial', 'pose.She', 'phrases', ""'offer"", 'heart', '34', 'instead', '34', 'open', 'chest', '34', ""'wave"", '34', 'instead', '34', 'push', 'back', '34', 'had', 'keep', 'looking', 'see', 'what', 'meant.But', 'language', 'not', 'spiritual', 'meditation', 'shivasana', 'dharma', 'inversions', 'very', 'mild', 'ones', 'inversions', 'require', 'not', 'moving', 'do', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'exercise', 'function', 'Also', 'not', 'alot', 'work', 'leading', 'up', 'poses', 'best', 'yoga', 'take', 'work', 'triangle', 'say', '10', 'minutes', 'using', 'different', 'small', 'variations', 'exercise', 'deepen', 'twist', 'open', 'shoulder', 'activate', 'standing', 'leg', 'etc.', 'handstand', 'jump', 'practice', 'when', 'half', 'handstand', 'feet', 'wall', 'much', 'better', 'way', 'start', 'build', 'shoulder', 'arm', 'core', 'strength', 'need.I', ""'d"", 'characterize', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'level', 'core', 'workout', '-it', 'fast', 'flexibility', 'experience', 'yoga', 'are', 'looking', 'strengthen', 'core', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'workout', 'hour', 'do', 'want', 'help', 'building', 'home', 'yoga', 'practice', 'probably', 'not']",Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga Power Hour with Sadie Nardini
1182974,AWMU4C4CH21TE,B001DQNPDE,YogaGirl,"[67, 68]","I just finished doing this dvd this morning.  My first impression is that this a hard workout and the physical benefits are worth the effort. However since, power yoga is not my normal practice, I felt like I was missing something.  Perhaps the spiritual aspect of the yoga.  That aside, this a great yoga class to get you into shape.  Lots of planks and up dogs AND lots, I mean lots of ab work.Setting:  Bare studio with concrete looking floors.  Sadie is set up in front of a window with a heating vent beneath it.  Very stark.  She is on a black mat and is wearing black.  When the camera pulls back, it is hard to distinguish her body from the mat.Production quality:  I read the back of the dvd cover and it said that you can pick from 2 views, one normal and one 3D where you can see the poses from different angles???? I didn't see that option on my dvd??  The camera was to the side of her throughout most of the class.  Also when I first watched the dvd, I chose the beginners option.  About 5 minutes into that I realized that there was absolutely no cuing, just wah wah wah commentary.  I thought, oh no , another dvd to return to amazon!  Something told me to go back to the menu and just press play.  Aha, cuing, such as it is.  Her cuing is often late and doesn't match the movement.  I don't know how these dvds are made,but I am assuming the audio is added after the video while watching it.  How hard is it to match up the instructions to the movement?  Several times I had to crane my neck to see what was going on only to realize that she had moved on to another pose.Wow factor:  As I said physically, this was challenging. If you are a beginner as I am when it comes to vinyasa yoga, you will not be able to keep up.  I wasn't able to.  As such, I didn't feel really good after the practice, not like I did after Jennifer Lynn's flow yoga dvd.  It moves really fast and is over in 60 minutes (gratefully!)  Will do it again, only because I am trying to get back in shape and power yoga beats lifting weights any day of the week.Simple suggestions:  I know she is producing another dvd due out in February (checked out her website).  A couple of suggestions.  Pretty up the space a little.  Cover up the air vent.  Black clothes, different color mat, or vice versa.  Fix the cuing.  This is so important on yoga dvds.  Try different camera angles on poses, it helps, alot.To me these type of classes are always better when there is more than one person in the class.  Perhaps someone who is less flexible with a diffeent body type.  Just my suggestions for whatever they're worth :)Overall good dvd. Good class. UPDATE: I returned the dvd.  I went to her website and saw a video clip of her upcoming dvd.  It looks much better and more comprehensive than this one.  I couldn't see owning them both.",4,Very Challenging,1228694400,"12 8, 2008",2008,2819,"['just', 'finished', 'doing', 'dvd', 'morning', 'first', 'impression', 'hard', 'workout', 'physical', 'benefits', 'are', 'effort', 'However', 'power', 'yoga', 'not', 'normal', 'practice', 'felt', 'was', 'missing', 'something', 'Perhaps', 'spiritual', 'aspect', 'yoga', 'aside', 'great', 'yoga', 'class', 'get', 'shape', 'Lots', 'planks', 'up', 'dogs', 'AND', 'lots', 'mean', 'lots', 'ab', 'work.Setting', 'Bare', 'studio', 'concrete', 'looking', 'floors', 'Sadie', 'set', 'up', 'front', 'window', 'heating', 'vent', 'Very', 'stark', 'black', 'mat', 'wearing', 'black', 'When', 'camera', 'back', 'hard', 'distinguish', 'body', 'mat.Production', 'quality', 'read', 'back', 'dvd', 'cover', 'said', 'can', 'pick', '2', 'views', 'one', 'normal', 'one', '3D', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'poses', 'different', 'angles', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'option', 'dvd', 'camera', 'was', 'side', 'most', 'class', 'Also', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'dvd', 'chose', 'beginners', 'option', '5', 'minutes', 'realized', 'was', 'absolutely', 'cuing', 'just', 'wah', 'wah', 'wah', 'commentary', 'thought', 'oh', 'dvd', 'return', 'amazon', 'Something', 'told', 'go', 'back', 'menu', 'just', 'press', 'play', 'Aha', 'cuing', 'such', 'cuing', 'often', 'late', ""n't"", 'match', 'movement', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'dvds', 'are', 'made', 'am', 'assuming', 'audio', 'added', 'video', 'watching', 'How', 'hard', 'match', 'up', 'instructions', 'movement', 'Several', 'times', 'had', 'crane', 'neck', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'only', 'realize', 'had', 'moved', 'pose.Wow', 'factor', 'said', 'physically', 'was', 'challenging', 'are', 'beginner', 'am', 'when', 'vinyasa', 'yoga', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'such', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'really', 'good', 'practice', 'not', 'did', 'Jennifer', 'Lynn', 'flow', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'really', 'fast', 'over', '60', 'minutes', 'gratefully', 'Will', 'do', 'again', 'only', 'am', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'shape', 'power', 'yoga', 'beats', 'lifting', 'weights', 'day', 'week.Simple', 'suggestions', 'know', 'producing', 'dvd', 'due', 'out', 'February', 'checked', 'out', 'website', 'couple', 'suggestions', 'Pretty', 'space', 'little', 'Cover', 'up', 'air', 'vent', 'Black', 'clothes', 'different', 'color', 'mat', 'vice', 'versa', 'Fix', 'cuing', 'so', 'important', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'Try', 'different', 'camera', 'angles', 'poses', 'alot.To', 'type', 'classes', 'are', 'always', 'better', 'when', 'more', 'one', 'person', 'class', 'Perhaps', 'someone', 'who', 'less', 'flexible', 'diffeent', 'body', 'type', 'Just', 'suggestions', 'whatever', ""'re"", 'worth', 'Overall', 'good', 'dvd', 'Good', 'class', 'UPDATE', 'returned', 'dvd', 'went', 'website', 'saw', 'video', 'clip', 'upcoming', 'dvd', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'owning']",Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga Power Hour with Sadie Nardini
