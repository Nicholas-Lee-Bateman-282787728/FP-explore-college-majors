1655819,A12RMAJXRPQWTY,B00DJID54I,C.Wallace,"[3, 3]","A girl, fifteen, is murdered. Strong clues point to a suspect who is quickly picked up by the police. The suspect appears to be a real low life. He even laughs at the police, apparently mocking them. Yet, he is released due to a lack of hard evidence. An outraged officer decides to take the law into his own hands... Things go south; I'm talking Tierra del Fuego south.All of the above happens in the opening portions of this film. Some variation of this theme has often appeared in movie land. What distinguishes this production from others of the same sort, it seems to me, is brilliant cinematography. It's set on the coast in England. Much of the action takes place on the beach. The town nearby is also depicted with great skill.I thought the acting was somewhat uneven. There were emotional outbursts that seemed forced, unnatural.  I thought one character, the aging, going senile, father of two of the police officers in the story, added very little to the mix. The ending was rather weak.Yet, it did keep me engaged to the end.

1655823,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00DJID54I,Grady Harp,"[3, 5]","BLOOD as written by Bill Gallagher and directed by Nick Murphy is a dark psychological drama set in Hilbre Island, Wirral, Merseyside, England: the setting is almost as important as the story. Unlike other thriller dramas based on good cop/bad cop concepts, this story is about a family of policemen and how they deal with crime and the ramifications of their actions as preservers of justice. It probes deeply into the crisis of a small family and manages to keep a tight grip on the audience's attention throughout.Joe Fairburn (Paul Bettany) and his younger brother Chrissie Fairburn (Stephen Graham) are the sons of retired policeman Lenny Fairburn (Brian Cox) who despite his advancing senility still comes around the police station to relive the old days. The brothers are investigating the brutal murder of a young girl found bludgeoned on the streets. The chief suspect is one Jason Buleigh (Ben Crompton) who despite a criminal record seems to be covering his old life with a religious one, a turn that pleases his supportive mother (Sandra Voe). But mounting evidence of finding Jason's photographs of young girls in his room convinces Joe and Chrissie that Jason is guilty despite the fact that their fellow policeman Robert Seymour (Mark Strong) doesn't feel the evidence is strong enough to keep Jason arrested. The brothers take the law into their own hands and in an attempt to get a confession from Jason, Joe has him dig a hole in the beach sand, and in a terrifying moment Jason (in the process of being buried) confesses and Joe's mind goes berserk and he kills Jason with a shovel. From this point on the brothers begin meltdown: they bury the body and destroy all evidence, Chrissie's girlfriend Jemma (Zo Tapper) finally hears the truth, the true killer of the murdered girl are found and arrested, Joe is discovered to be the killer of Jason, and the once tight family disintegrates - plunging into tragedy.The plotline is tangled at times by subplots that don't develop but in fact that leads to the sense of mental confusion both brothers carry, having committed a crime as cops, burying the evidence only to attempt to distract the truth of the deed that leads to failures.  Bettany, Graham and Cox are strong in their roles as is Mark Strong in the rather small role he is given. This is a dark film, well acted, with an interesting turn in the tales of how cops face their own actions.

Mark Strong, brilliantly plays the smart detective bent on finding the killer.A suspect is found quickly, but because of a lack of evidence, he is let go. Joe and Chrissie on a drunken night decide to follow their father's old ways. This leads to a terrible night, one they will never forget. This is a film about falling apart, losing our way, trying to recover, but we know we won't. Along the way, the film failed, becoming formulaic, and far too long. The film ran out of a credible script, and too much agony and defeat took over.Stellar performances by Brian Cox who plays the Fairburn's father, who suffers from dementia, and Mark Strong, who always has the best performance he can give.

It is set in a nameless part of Northern England and involves a family where policing is in the blood. Brother cops, Joe Fairburn (Paul Bettany `Master and Commander') and Chrissie Fairburn (Stephen Graham `Best laid Plans') have to investigate the murder of a schoolgirl. Although she has not been sexually abused they still turn their attention to a locally known paedophile and in great cop tradition decide that he has done it, irrespective of the evidence.Well their boss knows better and realises that they are going to have to let him go with their circumstantial, at best, case. The thing is they feel personally affronted by this person. So after a night partying where their father (Brian Cox) has regaled them with tales of police confession extractions, in the good old days, so duly inspired they come up with a cunning plan. That is when everything goes massively wrong and they become the police assigned to solve a crime that they themselves have committed.This is a great plot and a stellar cast and is actually rather good but considering the cast could or should have been a lot better. We have Mark Strong playing the loner cop who just wants the truth and he is one of the best actors of his generation. Brian Cox is always excellent but does not get much screen time as the dementia suffering ex cop. It is gritty in places and actually griping, but the whole thing has an inevitability about the ending which became a bit too predictable a bit too early. Still I did enjoy most of this and I have not seen the original TV series so am unable to compare, but there is enough here to like hence my rating. Still nice to see some great British talent all in the same film and this is far from being a poor film, director Nick Murphy filmed this around The Wirral where he grew up and has to get thumbs up for the setting and cinematography and I look forward to more from him.",4,Brit Cop Crime Thriller with a very good cast indeed,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,1977,"['re-imagining', 'BBC', 'six', 'part', 'thriller', '2004', 'called', 'Conviction', 'set', 'nameless', 'part', 'Northern', 'England', 'family', 'where', 'policing', 'blood', 'Brother', 'cops', 'Joe', 'Fairburn', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Chrissie', 'Fairburn', 'Stephen', 'Graham', 'Best', 'laid', 'Plans', 'have', 'investigate', 'murder', 'schoolgirl', 'not', 'been', 'sexually', 'abused', 'still', 'turn', 'attention', 'locally', 'known', 'paedophile', 'great', 'cop', 'tradition', 'decide', 'done', 'irrespective', 'evidence.Well', 'boss', 'better', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'let', 'go', 'circumstantial', 'best', 'case', 'thing', 'feel', 'personally', 'affronted', 'person', 'So', 'night', 'partying', 'where', 'father', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'regaled', 'tales', 'police', 'confession', 'extractions', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'so', 'duly', 'inspired', 'come', 'up', 'cunning', 'plan', 'when', 'everything', 'massively', 'wrong', 'become', 'police', 'assigned', 'solve', 'crime', 'have', 'committed.This', 'great', 'plot', 'stellar', 'cast', 'actually', 'rather', 'good', 'considering', 'cast', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'have', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'playing', 'loner', 'cop', 'who', 'just', 'truth', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'generation', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'always', 'excellent', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'dementia', 'suffering', 'ex', 'cop', 'gritty', 'places', 'actually', 'griping', 'whole', 'thing', 'inevitability', 'ending', 'became', 'bit', 'too', 'predictable', 'bit', 'too', 'early', 'Still', 'did', 'enjoy', 'most', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'am', 'unable', 'compare', 'enough', 'here', 'like', 'hence', 'rating', 'Still', 'nice', 'see', 'great', 'British', 'talent', 'same', 'film', 'far', 'being', 'poor', 'film', 'director', 'Nick', 'Murphy', 'filmed', 'Wirral', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'get', 'thumbs', 'up', 'setting', 'cinematography', 'look', 'forward', 'more']",N/A
