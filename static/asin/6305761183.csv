This collection includes some of his best work, and these short films now shine like never before on this new  gorgeous DVD release. -This almost hypnotic new video format (DVD) seem to  have a very positive effect on people in the industry, bringing them to  seek the release of many a lost or forgotten treasure. I think the future  looks golden, indeed. There's something truly unique about the high art of  stop-motion, and personally I feel the older it is, strangely enough the  better it is somehow. Also adding to the fun in this case, is hearing the  wonderfully voiced Boris Karloff narrate one. Let's hope more Trnka stuff  (and puppet trickery in general) is on the way; he and other Czech  animators, like Karel Zeman, deserves it.",5,The Master of puppets.,958867200,"05 21, 2000",2000,849,"['What', 'Harryhausen', 'Pal', 'are', 'America', 'Trnka', 'Eastern', 'European', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'Master', 'collection', 'best', 'work', 'short', 'films', 'now', 'shine', 'never', 'before', 'new', 'gorgeous', 'DVD', 'release', 'almost', 'hypnotic', 'new', 'video', 'format', 'DVD', 'seem', 'have', 'very', 'positive', 'effect', 'people', 'industry', 'bringing', 'seek', 'release', 'many', 'lost', 'forgotten', 'treasure', 'think', 'future', 'golden', 'indeed', 'something', 'truly', 'unique', 'high', 'art', 'stop-motion', 'personally', 'feel', 'older', 'strangely', 'better', 'somehow', 'Also', 'adding', 'fun', 'case', 'hearing', 'wonderfully', 'voiced', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'narrate', 'one', 'Let', 'hope', 'more', 'Trnka', 'stuff', 'puppet', 'trickery', 'general', 'way', 'other', 'Czech', 'animators', 'Karel', 'Zeman']",The Puppet Films of Jiri Trnka

We watched avidly for his films as they were technically fascinating, extremely witty and had a depth which english language films so lacked.In viewing Trnka again after so many years it has dated in technique but is still as fresh in content.We have become so used to the marvels of computer animation that the labourious process of stop photography with its shortcomings sadly seems somewhat lacking. However Trnka, the master, can still show a trick or two as far as content is concerned.This film is a sentimental journey for many of us, but is well worth watching as  a stage of filmic development.",4,Jiri Trnka,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,705,"['youth', 'Jiri', 'Trnka', 'was', 'ground', 'breaker', 'world', 'puppet', 'animation', 'creative', 'narrative', 'watched', 'avidly', 'films', 'were', 'technically', 'fascinating', 'extremely', 'witty', 'had', 'depth', 'english', 'language', 'films', 'so', 'lacked.In', 'viewing', 'Trnka', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'dated', 'technique', 'still', 'fresh', 'content.We', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'used', 'marvels', 'computer', 'animation', 'labourious', 'process', 'stop', 'photography', 'shortcomings', 'sadly', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'However', 'Trnka', 'master', 'can', 'still', 'show', 'trick', 'two', 'as', 'far', 'content', 'concerned.This', 'film', 'sentimental', 'journey', 'many', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'stage', 'filmic', 'development']",The Puppet Films of Jiri Trnka

It has a simple, yet charming quality to it. There isn't much said, but it has a beautiful message. The backgrounds are interesting at times, and the characters just look like dolls, but this add's more interest to the film. The only problem is that for the dvd I felt they should have inhanced the color/picture quality. Very faded, and warn looking. The extra feature is a George Pal short of John Henry and the Inky Poo. You can find George Pal on DVD on Amazon.com, and his Puppetoons.So in the long run I really enjoyed this stop frame animation film.",4,Nice film,1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,679,"['film', 'animation', 'was', 'lacking', 'character', 'facial', 'expressions', 'However', 'worked', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'simple', 'yet', 'charming', 'quality', ""n't"", 'much', 'said', 'beautiful', 'message', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'interesting', 'times', 'characters', 'just', 'look', 'like', 'dolls', 'add', 'more', 'interest', 'film', 'only', 'problem', 'dvd', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'inhanced', 'color/picture', 'quality', 'Very', 'faded', 'warn', 'looking', 'extra', 'feature', 'George', 'Pal', 'short', 'John', 'Henry', 'Inky', 'Poo', 'can', 'find', 'George', 'Pal', 'DVD', 'Amazon.com', 'Puppetoons.So', 'long', 'run', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'stop', 'frame', 'animation', 'film']",The Puppet Films of Jiri Trnka
476740,AUTBHG6070SL4,6305761183,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[3, 4]","If ever a man was born to his trade and art, it was Trnka. He grew up helping his grandmother make dolls and his mother with her work as a seamstress. By the time started making his movies, in his 30s, he had utter fluency in all of the manual skill needed for success. For new success, that is, because his career as an artist was already well established by then.This DVD splits almost evenly into a feature length piece and six shorts. The former, ""The Emperor's Nightingale,"" is a wonderful adaptation of a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. It touches on many things, including the monotony of mechanical perfection compared to the unpredictable beauty of the organic world. Trnka objected to the Soviet regime that controlled the Czech people during most of his adult life. That was the hand that fed him, though, as well as the hand that could crush him. If there's a subtext of rebellion by a living society against a rigid, mechanical system of control, it's written in very small print.The shorts varied widely in holding my attention. The cartoon adaptation of Chekov's ""The Bass Cello"" is warm and funny, with a delightful chill in it for anyone who's had a no-pants dream filled with frustration and embarassment. ""A Drop Too Much"" could possibly have been a public service feature, about a 15 minute sermon on the evils of drinking and driving. It comes across with the complexity and moral tone of one of those ""Davey and Goliath"" cartoons I never much liked as a kid. ""The Merry Circus"" is interesting for an innovative animation technique, one with many strengths and weakness relative to normal model making, and ""The Song of the Prarie"" is a silly satire of the 1950s Western movies - already pretty silly in themselves.Only ""The Hand"" really stands out in that set. It's a modern fairy tale about artistic and personal freedom in the face of massive, controlling social power. Small wonder that this piece won awards abroad and suppression in his home country.The style is a bit dated, and scripting tends towards a meditative pace. There's not a lot here for the ADHD generation, unless they're truly dedicated fans of animation. For us in the middle ground, there's a lot to enjoy, but the world has other things to enjoy in it, too.//wiredweird",4,Charming animation,1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,2271,"['ever', 'man', 'was', 'born', 'trade', 'art', 'was', 'Trnka', 'grew', 'up', 'helping', 'grandmother', 'make', 'dolls', 'mother', 'work', 'seamstress', 'time', 'started', 'making', 'movies', '30s', 'had', 'utter', 'fluency', 'manual', 'skill', 'needed', 'success', 'new', 'success', 'career', 'artist', 'was', 'already', 'well', 'established', 'then.This', 'DVD', 'almost', 'evenly', 'feature', 'length', 'piece', 'six', 'shorts', 'former', 'Emperor', 'Nightingale', 'wonderful', 'adaptation', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'many', 'things', 'including', 'monotony', 'mechanical', 'perfection', 'compared', 'unpredictable', 'beauty', 'organic', 'world', 'Trnka', 'objected', 'Soviet', 'regime', 'controlled', 'Czech', 'people', 'most', 'adult', 'life', 'was', 'hand', 'fed', 'though', 'as', 'well', 'hand', 'could', 'crush', 'subtext', 'rebellion', 'living', 'society', 'rigid', 'mechanical', 'system', 'control', 'written', 'very', 'small', 'print.The', 'shorts', 'varied', 'widely', 'holding', 'attention', 'cartoon', 'adaptation', 'Chekov', 'Bass', 'Cello', 'warm', 'funny', 'delightful', 'chill', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'no-pants', 'dream', 'filled', 'frustration', 'embarassment', 'Drop', 'Too', 'Much', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'been', 'public', 'service', 'feature', '15', 'minute', 'sermon', 'evils', 'drinking', 'driving', 'complexity', 'moral', 'tone', 'one', 'Davey', 'Goliath', 'cartoons', 'never', 'much', 'liked', 'kid', 'Merry', 'Circus', 'interesting', 'innovative', 'animation', 'technique', 'one', 'many', 'strengths', 'weakness', 'relative', 'normal', 'model', 'making', 'Song', 'Prarie', 'silly', 'satire', '1950s', 'Western', 'movies', 'already', 'pretty', 'silly', 'themselves.Only', 'Hand', 'really', 'out', 'set', 'modern', 'fairy', 'tale', 'artistic', 'personal', 'freedom', 'face', 'massive', 'controlling', 'social', 'power', 'Small', 'wonder', 'piece', 'won', 'awards', 'abroad', 'suppression', 'home', 'country.The', 'style', 'bit', 'dated', 'scripting', 'tends', 'meditative', 'pace', 'not', 'lot', 'here', 'ADHD', 'generation', ""'re"", 'truly', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'animation', 'middle', 'ground', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'world', 'other', 'things', 'enjoy', 'too.//wiredweird']",The Puppet Films of Jiri Trnka
