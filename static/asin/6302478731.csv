My favorite was when the woman was driving her car, and all of a sudden her brakes won't work and her car starts ramming into other cars. Jim Wynorski, b-movie extraordinare, directed this one. He has the ability to make a low-budget movie look like a big-budget movie. 976-Evil 2 is no exception, looking great with some decent special effects. Both Brigette Nielson and Buck Flower have small roles. 976-Evil is worth checking out if you're a fan of the first one, or of the Nightmare on Elm Street series. And you can own it, if you buy the recent 8 pack horror collection, that just came out courtesy of Lions Gate.",3,Slight Improvement Over First 976-Evil,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,731,"['976-Evil', '2', 'sequel', 'little', 'better', 'original', 'not', 'great', 'cool', 'moments', 'favorite', 'was', 'when', 'woman', 'was', 'driving', 'car', 'sudden', 'brakes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'car', 'ramming', 'other', 'cars', 'Jim', 'Wynorski', 'b-movie', 'extraordinare', 'directed', 'one', 'ability', 'make', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'look', 'big-budget', 'movie', '976-Evil', '2', 'exception', 'looking', 'great', 'decent', 'special', 'effects', 'Brigette', 'Nielson', 'Buck', 'Flower', 'have', 'small', 'roles', '976-Evil', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'fan', 'first', 'one', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'series', 'can', 'own', 'buy', 'recent', '8', 'pack', 'horror', 'collection', 'just', 'came', 'out', 'courtesy', 'Lions', 'Gate']",N/A

Leather bound bad boy, Spike (Patrick O'Bryan), joins forces with Robin who has developed a psychic link with the maniac.Not a really horrible flick, but not really that good either.

314695,A3UA046AA3DXFD,6302478731,Sid the Elf,"[1, 3]","During the giant refrigerator specs craze of the 80's and 90's Santa was on a tear maxing out his credit cards on 976 numbers he found in the back of his ""adult viewing"" magazines stashed in the right bottom desk drawer. Sure for most it would be obvious the person on the other end wasn't a smoking hot model and there was no such gentleman as ""Hector pleased to meet you with meat to please you."" Naturally Santa didn't understand this and somehow still lives in the very same state of disillusion that he did then. Long story short the choice to watch 976-Evil 2 was inspired our friend Santa and decided to honor him with the review.976-Evil 2 starts out with a shower scene within the first couple minutes ensuring this was a film we would have given the seal of approval late night back in 94. From there we're introduced to a biker, that looks like Larry from Summer School, and he treks across country to find out why all his friends have suddenly been murdered. Along his trip he runs into Debbie James who is also trying to solve some puzzling local murders that seem to be cause by some 976 number. Turns out this number possesses anyone who calls forcing them to do some crazy stuff. Honestly not scary in any sense but quite hilarious due to extreme B acting and horrific plot.Since we dedicated this one to Santa we were a little let down. I mean this is a guy we spent years pegging with stuff while he slept, so c'mon can't we do a little better then this. We even snuck up to a window and air horned the jiffy out of him back in the 2000's so it's only fair to honor him with something a bit more effective. It's ok though because our constitutional duty forces us to watch as much 90's B as possible so not all was lost. Maybe we should honor Santa while reviewing that movie he kept hidden inside the grandfather clock. Yeah you know, the real confusing one with the two chicks....still can't figure out what that thing was.",2,This may be the only 976 number Santa didn't call during the early 90's,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,1943,"['giant', 'refrigerator', 'specs', 'craze', '80', '90', 'Santa', 'was', 'tear', 'maxing', 'out', 'credit', 'cards', '976', 'numbers', 'found', 'back', 'adult', 'viewing', 'magazines', 'stashed', 'right', 'bottom', 'desk', 'drawer', 'Sure', 'most', 'would', 'be', 'obvious', 'person', 'other', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'smoking', 'hot', 'model', 'was', 'such', 'gentleman', 'Hector', 'pleased', 'meet', 'meat', 'please', 'Naturally', 'Santa', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'somehow', 'still', 'very', 'same', 'state', 'disillusion', 'did', 'then', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'choice', 'watch', '976-Evil', '2', 'was', 'inspired', 'friend', 'Santa', 'decided', 'honor', 'review.976-Evil', '2', 'out', 'shower', 'scene', 'first', 'couple', 'minutes', 'ensuring', 'was', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'seal', 'approval', 'late', 'night', 'back', '94', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'biker', 'Larry', 'Summer', 'School', 'country', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'friends', 'have', 'suddenly', 'been', 'murdered', 'trip', 'Debbie', 'James', 'who', 'also', 'trying', 'solve', 'puzzling', 'local', 'murders', 'seem', 'be', 'cause', '976', 'number', 'out', 'number', 'anyone', 'who', 'forcing', 'do', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'Honestly', 'not', 'scary', 'sense', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'due', 'extreme', 'B', 'acting', 'horrific', 'plot.Since', 'dedicated', 'one', 'Santa', 'were', 'little', 'let', 'mean', 'guy', 'spent', 'years', 'pegging', 'stuff', 'slept', 'so', ""c'mon"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'little', 'better', 'then', 'even', 'snuck', 'up', 'window', 'air', 'horned', 'jiffy', 'back', '2000', 'only', 'fair', 'honor', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'effective', 'ok', 'constitutional', 'duty', 'forces', 'watch', 'as', 'much', '90', 'B', 'possible', 'not', 'was', 'lost', 'Maybe', 'should', 'honor', 'Santa', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'kept', 'hidden', 'grandfather', 'clock', 'Yeah', 'know', 'real', 'confusing', 'one', 'two', 'chicks', '.still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'thing', 'was']",N/A
