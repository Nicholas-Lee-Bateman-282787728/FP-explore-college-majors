As has been stated by another reviewer, Whitney was a bit too old for the part, but there is a certain sweetness to her performance, especially in the scenes where she seeks comfort from the Apparition in the face of her mother's hostility.As Lucia's cousins, Sherry Jackson is an undeniably winsome Jacinta Marto, and Sammy Ogg captures Francisco Marto's prankish spirit. As a group, the children are darling and one does feel the need to see them vindicated.Angela Clarke is powerful as Maria Rosa Dos Santos, a woman trying to see her family through hard times, but initally unable to accept the fruition of everything she has prayed for.Gilbert Roland's Hugo is a fictitious character, but every child needs someone like Hugo in their lives.Frank Silvera, as the villainous administrator, comes across as a reject from a '30s gangster movie. Carl Millitaire, as the Magistrate had a bit more refinement in his villainy.The Voice of the Virgin Mary, is apparently that of the actress who portrayed Bambi's mother a decade earlier, Paula Winslow. It is curious that the image of the Lady, as she appears to the children, is so faded that the audience can barely see her.Richard Hale, as the parish priest is authoritative, but sympathetic to the children as he tries to find the truth about what happened in the Cova da Iria.I noticed actress Julia Faye, whom I remember as Elisheba in ""The Ten Commandments"" among the extras. There are certain scenes of this movie that remind me of that one.The Third Apparition, during which the children saw a vision of Hell, is depicted differently. Dos Santos orders the arrest of the children as well as the crowd of people gathered and rioting breaks out while the children are taken out of harm's way. A month later, however, the magistrate succeeds in arresting the children, and the title for this review was inspired by the scene of the three innocents standing before the administrator's desk being scolded, as children often are. The scene of hardened criminals on their knees praying with the children is an incredibly stirring one.Eventually, the story reaches its triumphant climax with a few powerful as well as comical moments along the way. It is a fine tribute to the power of the common people in a time of crisis. The Miracle of the Sun is magnificently depicted.This colorful retelling of events in 1917 is all about emotions as well as faith. Whatever a viewer's denomination, one can't help but be moved by the simple faith of three young shepherds and the way that their faith toppled the atheistic government that tried to crush them.",3,It's Nice to Have Cousins With Whom To Get Into Trouble,1017964800,"04 5, 2002",2002,3050,"['reverent', 'manner', 'story', 'told', 'beautiful', 'numbers', 'Norman', 'Luboff', 'Choir', 'make', 'up', 'less-than-stellar', 'acting', 'innaccuracies.Observe', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'chose', 'green-eyed', 'Susan', 'Whitney', 'portray', 'Lucia', 'Dos', 'Santos', 'order', 'appeal', '1950s', 'audience', 'tended', 'make', 'heroes', 'heroines', 'fairer-skinned', 'order', 'appease', 'society', 'too', 'narrow-minded', 'see', 'darker', 'complexioned', 'people', 'such', 'terms', 'been', 'stated', 'reviewer', 'Whitney', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'certain', 'sweetness', 'performance', 'especially', 'scenes', 'where', 'comfort', 'Apparition', 'face', 'mother', 'hostility.As', 'Lucia', 'cousins', 'Sherry', 'Jackson', 'undeniably', 'winsome', 'Jacinta', 'Marto', 'Sammy', 'Ogg', 'Francisco', 'Marto', 'prankish', 'spirit', 'group', 'children', 'are', 'darling', 'one', 'feel', 'need', 'see', 'vindicated.Angela', 'Clarke', 'powerful', 'Maria', 'Rosa', 'Dos', 'Santos', 'woman', 'trying', 'see', 'family', 'hard', 'times', 'initally', 'unable', 'accept', 'fruition', 'everything', 'prayed', 'for.Gilbert', 'Roland', 'Hugo', 'fictitious', 'character', 'child', 'someone', 'Hugo', 'lives.Frank', 'Silvera', 'villainous', 'administrator', 'across', 'reject', ""'30s"", 'gangster', 'movie', 'Carl', 'Millitaire', 'Magistrate', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'refinement', 'villainy.The', 'Voice', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'apparently', 'actress', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'decade', 'earlier', 'Paula', 'Winslow', 'curious', 'image', 'Lady', 'children', 'so', 'faded', 'audience', 'can', 'barely', 'see', 'her.Richard', 'Hale', 'parish', 'priest', 'authoritative', 'sympathetic', 'children', 'find', 'truth', 'what', 'happened', 'Cova', 'da', 'Iria.I', 'noticed', 'actress', 'Julia', 'Faye', 'whom', 'remember', 'Elisheba', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'extras', 'are', 'certain', 'scenes', 'movie', 'remind', 'one.The', 'Third', 'Apparition', 'children', 'saw', 'vision', 'Hell', 'depicted', 'differently', 'Dos', 'Santos', 'orders', 'arrest', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'crowd', 'people', 'gathered', 'rioting', 'breaks', 'out', 'children', 'are', 'taken', 'harm', 'way', 'month', 'later', 'however', 'magistrate', 'arresting', 'children', 'title', 'review', 'was', 'inspired', 'scene', 'three', 'innocents', 'standing', 'administrator', 'desk', 'being', 'scolded', 'children', 'often', 'are', 'scene', 'hardened', 'criminals', 'knees', 'praying', 'children', 'incredibly', 'stirring', 'one.Eventually', 'story', 'triumphant', 'climax', 'few', 'powerful', 'as', 'well', 'comical', 'moments', 'way', 'fine', 'tribute', 'power', 'common', 'people', 'time', 'crisis', 'Miracle', 'Sun', 'magnificently', 'depicted.This', 'colorful', 'retelling', 'events', '1917', 'about', 'emotions', 'as', 'well', 'faith', 'Whatever', 'viewer', 'denomination', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'moved', 'simple', 'faith', 'three', 'young', 'shepherds', 'way', 'faith', 'toppled', 'atheistic', 'government', 'tried', 'crush']",N/A

Pawl ""Dani""","[13, 14]","THE MIRACLE OF OUR LADY OF FATIMA recounts the experience of three young Portuguese children who saw the vistion of Our Lady of Fatima, while playing in the cova (meadowland) in a cloud of light in the sky.  This was during the height of World War II, when the government was extremely repressive and anti-religious.  Priests seen wearing their religious garments in public were arrested and charged as criminals.  Lucia (Susan Whitney), one of the children, was told by the Lady of Fatima to come again to the cova and to be a vessel for her message.  However, Hugo (Gilbert Roland), an agnostic adult friend of the children, tells them to be quiet about their experience, so as to stay safe from the extreme laws (that could include torture of anyone who challenges the government's decree).The strength of the story lies in its quiet power to give validity, dignity and respect to the children's experience, without being preachy.  It is truly a remarkable story worth seeing to believe.",5,beautiful and powerful film......,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,990,"['MIRACLE', 'OF', 'OUR', 'LADY', 'OF', 'FATIMA', 'experience', 'three', 'young', 'Portuguese', 'children', 'who', 'saw', 'vistion', 'Lady', 'Fatima', 'playing', 'cova', 'meadowland', 'cloud', 'light', 'sky', 'was', 'height', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'when', 'government', 'was', 'extremely', 'repressive', 'anti-religious', 'Priests', 'seen', 'wearing', 'religious', 'garments', 'public', 'were', 'arrested', 'charged', 'criminals', 'Lucia', 'Susan', 'Whitney', 'one', 'children', 'was', 'told', 'Lady', 'Fatima', 'come', 'again', 'cova', 'be', 'vessel', 'message', 'However', 'Hugo', 'Gilbert', 'Roland', 'agnostic', 'adult', 'friend', 'children', 'be', 'quiet', 'experience', 'so', 'stay', 'safe', 'extreme', 'laws', 'could', 'include', 'torture', 'anyone', 'who', 'government', 'decree', 'strength', 'story', 'quiet', 'power', 'give', 'validity', 'dignity', 'respect', 'children', 'experience', 'being', 'preachy', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'story', 'worth', 'seeing', 'believe']",N/A

The story is well paced and puts credibility on the events that transpired. I am not sure how much artistic liberty was taken with the happenings that can be objectively verified. But the basic story is there, minus the third secret that finally was publicly announced in the year 2000.There were six visitations on the 13th of six consecutive months. It was not clear in the film whether the children actually made it to the fourth one in time, and the fifth one was eliminated entirely.This film is food for thought for those who are wrestling with the idea of what to believe. As one reviewer said, the ordinary people would not have known about the threat from Russia, as Lenin and the Bolsheviks were coming into power. And then, how did the children know ahead of time that Francisco and Jacinta would die young, and that Lucia would live on--into her nineties and, I believe, still alive as I write these words?I did read an account somewhere that even observers who continued to disbelieve had to admit that there was a ""miracle of the sun."" Can meteorologists give us a good explanation of the phenomenon that could have occurred?This film can reinforce the devout believers, debunk those who are totally skeptical, and continue to challenge the rest of us as we try to figure out what really happened. Hope this becomes more widely available soon, possibly on DVD with commentary.",5,Still to be considered after all these years,1037664000,"11 19, 2002",2002,1530,"['search', 'engine', 'Amazon.com', 'was', 'able', 'acquire', 'Miracle', 'Lady', 'Fatima', 'see', 'again', '50', 'years', 'story', 'well', 'paced', 'credibility', 'events', 'transpired', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'artistic', 'liberty', 'was', 'taken', 'happenings', 'can', 'be', 'objectively', 'verified', 'basic', 'story', 'there', 'minus', 'third', 'secret', 'finally', 'was', 'publicly', 'announced', 'year', '2000.There', 'were', 'six', 'visitations', '13th', 'six', 'consecutive', 'months', 'was', 'not', 'clear', 'film', 'children', 'actually', 'made', 'fourth', 'one', 'time', 'fifth', 'one', 'was', 'eliminated', 'entirely.This', 'film', 'food', 'thought', 'who', 'are', 'wrestling', 'idea', 'what', 'believe', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'ordinary', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'threat', 'Russia', 'Lenin', 'Bolsheviks', 'were', 'coming', 'power', 'then', 'how', 'did', 'children', 'know', 'ahead', 'time', 'Francisco', 'Jacinta', 'would', 'die', 'young', 'Lucia', 'would', 'live', 'nineties', 'believe', 'still', 'alive', 'write', 'words', 'did', 'read', 'account', 'somewhere', 'even', 'observers', 'who', 'continued', 'disbelieve', 'had', 'admit', 'was', 'miracle', 'sun', 'Can', 'meteorologists', 'give', 'good', 'explanation', 'phenomenon', 'could', 'have', 'occurred', 'film', 'can', 'reinforce', 'devout', 'believers', 'debunk', 'who', 'are', 'totally', 'skeptical', 'continue', 'challenge', 'rest', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Hope', 'more', 'widely', 'available', 'soon', 'possibly', 'DVD', 'commentary']",N/A

The Fatima Visions were the shady, second-rate, and rather deceptive works of a Lourdes-copycat named Lucia dos Santos. Unlike the Lourdes apparitions, which resonate with a shocking simplicity, the gaudy, overbaked and hysterical messages given by the &quot;Lady&quot; of Fatima ( and the various angels and plastic-like 'saints' who also made cameo appearances) border on the ludicrous and insane.The &quot;messages&quot; of Fatima are rife with awkward, starch-stiff, bland prayers obviously confected by the local priests who were doubtless influencing (and coaching) these children, and the catastrophic warnings of the lady (not to mention constant, annoying self-references to her Immmaculate Heart) are further proof of a detached, bizarre and ultimately typical Catholicism. Fatima is perhaps the poorest quality and most transparently contrived religious hoax of the 20th century, but even then it has done some good in getting people to pray, so keep this in mind when watching this film about a very deceitful religious &quot;event.&quot;",2,FATIMA....SHMATIMA,1000598400,"09 16, 2001",2001,1176,"['film', 'surprisingly', 'well-done', 'terms', 'cinematography', 'rather', 'inexplicably', 'dubious', 'theme', 'Fatima', 'Visions', 'were', 'shady', 'second-rate', 'rather', 'deceptive', 'works', 'Lourdes-copycat', 'named', 'Lucia', 'dos', 'Santos', 'Lourdes', 'apparitions', 'resonate', 'shocking', 'simplicity', 'gaudy', 'overbaked', 'hysterical', 'messages', 'given', 'quot', 'Lady', 'quot', 'Fatima', 'various', 'angels', 'plastic-like', ""'saints"", 'who', 'also', 'made', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'border', 'ludicrous', 'insane.The', 'quot', 'messages', 'quot', 'Fatima', 'are', 'rife', 'awkward', 'starch-stiff', 'bland', 'prayers', 'obviously', 'confected', 'local', 'priests', 'who', 'were', 'doubtless', 'influencing', 'coaching', 'children', 'catastrophic', 'warnings', 'lady', 'not', 'mention', 'constant', 'annoying', 'self-references', 'Immmaculate', 'Heart', 'are', 'further', 'proof', 'detached', 'bizarre', 'ultimately', 'typical', 'Catholicism', 'Fatima', 'perhaps', 'poorest', 'quality', 'most', 'transparently', 'contrived', 'religious', 'hoax', '20th', 'century', 'even', 'then', 'done', 'good', 'getting', 'people', 'pray', 'so', 'keep', 'mind', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'very', 'deceitful', 'religious', 'quot', 'quot']",N/A
