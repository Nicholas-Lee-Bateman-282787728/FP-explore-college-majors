846355,A2IS16K96YSFDV,B0002V7U1Y,Eric Mayforth,"[1, 1]","Larry Bird was the greatest forward ever to play the game of basketball.  His shooting, passing, and court savvy thrilled both basketball purists and the casual NBA fan.  His 13-year pro career was storied, with three world titles and three league MVP awards.  I was very glad to see the retrospective on his career, ""A Basketball Legend,"" released on DVD--both to see it again and to replace the VHS copy I got for Christmas in 1991.This program traces Bird's career from high school in French Lick, Indiana, where he had some tough times growing up, to Indiana State University and his team's appearance in the 1979 NCAA title game.  There is extensive footage of great shots, moves, and passes by Bird in his pro career with the Boston Celtics, with comments by Red Auerbach, other Celtics legends, teammates, coaches, and rivals.  The Celtics had plenty of playoff success during the 1980s, and key playoff series against the 76ers, Lakers, Pistons, and Hawks are recalled.The 1984 season was the highlight of Bird's career, with Bird winning his first NBA MVP award and then facing Magic Johnson and the Lakers in the NBA Finals--the Celtics came back from the near-dead during the series to pull out the franchise's fifteenth championship.  The portion of the program that covers that season is simply exquisitely done--footage, background music, suspense, drama, triumph, everything.  I can remember watching that ten minutes or so a few times a week for the first several months I had it on VHS back when the earth cooled--it's. simply. that. good.The set also contains three games from Bird's career.  The first is the March 1985 game against the Atlanta Hawks in New Orleans when Bird scored a career-high 60 points--it was a highly entertaining, up-tempo game, with both teams running and taking a lot of quick shots.  The Celtics' ball movement was awesome in the game.The second game featured is the famous May 1988 shootout between Bird and Dominique Wilkins in Game Seven of the Eastern Conference Semifinals.  Wilkins and Bird both hit incredibly tough shots, and Wilkins scored 47 as the Hawks played the host Celtics close the whole way that afternoon.  Bird tallied 34, though, including 20 in the unforgettable fourth quarter as the Celtics escaped with a 118-116 win and headed to the Eastern Conference Finals for the last time in the Bird Era.The last game on the DVD set is one of Bird's post-heel surgery games, but not the one you might think.  Game Five against the Pacers in the first round in 1991 was not selected, but what was included instead is a thoroughly defensible choice--the memorable NBC-on-Sunday afternoon game in March 1992 in which Bird scored 49 to lead the Celtics to a wild 152-148 double overtime win against Finals-bound Portland.  Both the Celtics and Trail Blazers took--and hit--great shots in this contest that serves as a great example of what a joy it was to watch the NBA in the Eighties and early Nineties.""A Basketball Legend"" and the three included games would be greatly enjoyed by fans of Larry Bird, the Boston Celtics, or the old NBA.",5,"Larry Legend, the Greatest Forward Ever",1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,3097,"['Larry', 'Bird', 'was', 'greatest', 'forward', 'ever', 'play', 'game', 'basketball', 'shooting', 'passing', 'court', 'savvy', 'thrilled', 'basketball', 'purists', 'casual', 'NBA', 'fan', '13-year', 'pro', 'career', 'was', 'storied', 'three', 'world', 'titles', 'three', 'league', 'MVP', 'awards', 'was', 'very', 'glad', 'see', 'retrospective', 'career', 'Basketball', 'Legend', 'released', 'DVD', 'see', 'again', 'replace', 'VHS', 'copy', 'got', 'Christmas', '1991.This', 'program', 'traces', 'Bird', 'career', 'high', 'school', 'French', 'Lick', 'Indiana', 'where', 'had', 'tough', 'times', 'growing', 'up', 'Indiana', 'State', 'University', 'team', 'appearance', '1979', 'NCAA', 'title', 'game', 'extensive', 'footage', 'great', 'shots', 'moves', 'passes', 'Bird', 'pro', 'career', 'Boston', 'Celtics', 'comments', 'Red', 'Auerbach', 'other', 'Celtics', 'legends', 'teammates', 'coaches', 'rivals', 'Celtics', 'had', 'plenty', 'playoff', 'success', '1980s', 'key', 'playoff', 'series', '76ers', 'Lakers', 'Pistons', 'Hawks', 'are', 'recalled.The', '1984', 'season', 'was', 'highlight', 'Bird', 'career', 'Bird', 'winning', 'first', 'NBA', 'MVP', 'award', 'then', 'facing', 'Magic', 'Johnson', 'Lakers', 'NBA', 'Finals', 'Celtics', 'came', 'back', 'near-dead', 'series', 'pull', 'out', 'franchise', 'fifteenth', 'championship', 'portion', 'program', 'season', 'simply', 'exquisitely', 'done', 'footage', 'background', 'music', 'suspense', 'drama', 'triumph', 'everything', 'can', 'remember', 'watching', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'few', 'times', 'week', 'first', 'several', 'months', 'had', 'VHS', 'back', 'when', 'earth', 'cooled', 'simply', 'good.The', 'set', 'also', 'three', 'games', 'Bird', 'career', 'first', 'March', '1985', 'game', 'Atlanta', 'Hawks', 'New', 'Orleans', 'when', 'Bird', 'scored', 'career-high', '60', 'points', 'was', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'up-tempo', 'game', 'teams', 'running', 'taking', 'lot', 'quick', 'shots', 'Celtics', 'ball', 'movement', 'was', 'awesome', 'game.The', 'second', 'game', 'featured', 'famous', 'May', '1988', 'shootout', 'Bird', 'Dominique', 'Wilkins', 'Game', 'Seven', 'Eastern', 'Conference', 'Semifinals', 'Wilkins', 'Bird', 'hit', 'incredibly', 'tough', 'shots', 'Wilkins', 'scored', '47', 'Hawks', 'played', 'host', 'Celtics', 'close', 'whole', 'way', 'afternoon', 'Bird', 'tallied', '34', 'though', 'including', '20', 'unforgettable', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'Celtics', 'escaped', '118-116', 'win', 'headed', 'Eastern', 'Conference', 'Finals', 'last', 'time', 'Bird', 'Era.The', 'last', 'game', 'DVD', 'set', 'one', 'Bird', 'post-heel', 'surgery', 'games', 'not', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'Game', 'Five', 'Pacers', 'first', 'round', '1991', 'was', 'not', 'selected', 'what', 'was', 'included', 'instead', 'thoroughly', 'defensible', 'choice', 'memorable', 'NBC-on-Sunday', 'afternoon', 'game', 'March', '1992', 'Bird', 'scored', '49', 'lead', 'Celtics', 'wild', '152-148', 'double', 'overtime', 'win', 'Finals-bound', 'Portland', 'Celtics', 'Trail', 'Blazers', 'took', 'hit', 'great', 'shots', 'contest', 'great', 'example', 'what', 'joy', 'was', 'watch', 'NBA', 'Eighties', 'early', 'Nineties', 'Basketball', 'Legend', 'three', 'included', 'games', 'would', 'be', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'fans', 'Larry', 'Bird', 'Boston', 'Celtics', 'old', 'NBA']","Larry Bird: A Basketball Legend, 25th Anniversary Edition"

I became acquainted with the NBA when one of its more storied rivalries was in full bloom i.e. the Magic vrs Bird era.I really liked the way both the Lakers and the Celtics played ball but I especially liked the way Bird led his team.  Here was a guy who was not even remotely close to having the athleticism of most of the players on the court and yet didn't need it because he could always invent his shot to fit the situation; he was the ultimate thinking-man's player.  Later on, I became very impressed by his work ethic and how badly he wanted to win every game which showed whenever he played.These 2 dvds showcase all these qualities very well and although the picture quality isn't quite what you'd expect from a dvd in some spots, the reason is because they were taken from slightly deteriorated master tape sources.  Still, what makes this a great set to get is the second disc that contains 3 of Bird's best games.His 60-point game to break the all-time single game points total for a Celtic against the Hawks and this fifty-plus effort against the Blazers who actually reached the NBA Finals that year losing to the Jordan-led Bulls are my favourites.

846357,A391UWNYC7K7JS,B0002V7U1Y,"Gary Gardner ""Your resident dillettante""","[3, 3]","Larry Bird was often questioned as he entered the NBA draft in 1979: Aren't you too slow? Aren't you a little too flat-footed? Aren't you too one-dimensional to play the game at this level? Bird took all the criticism thrown at him, and smashed them all into little bits in front of his naysayers. In fact, the self-described ""Hick from French Lick"" (IN) would set the standard for professional basketball players everywhere. Besides being a prolific scorer, Larry Legend did all the little things that make one a winner on the court, i.e., going after any loose ball, hitting the boards, and passing the rock like a point guard, rather than the forward he was.Originally released on tape in 1991, ""Larry Bird: A Basketball Legend,"" celebrates Bird's 25 years in NBA basketball in the capacities of player, coach, and front-office czar. Actor Daniel Stern narrates this excellent overview of Bird's early life in the backwoods of Indiana, where he grew up poor but happy in his life's pursuit, the game of basketball, where it reigns supreme in his home state. Personal tragedies like his father's suicide are mentioned, as well as his attempt to play for large University of Indiana, where Larry was none too comfortable.Bird settled for attending smaller-campus Indiana State, which was closer to home, and brought his team to the championship final one year against Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson's Michigan State squad. The rest covers his awesome career with the NBA's Boston Celtics, a team in transition when the Birdman arrived in 1979. The great footage of Bird through those 13 years as a pro in Boston are great reminders for all fans who remembered watching the man play, as well as for youngsters who never got the chance, but appreciate quality basketball skills.The casual observer will be impressed, too, by Bird's modesty, his workmanship, and dedication to his craft and to winning. When asked by Brent Musburger after beating the rival Los Angeles Lakers in the 1984 NBA Finals in a hard-fought seven games whether things were even now between Bird and Magic Johnson since their meeting in the NCAA Finals years ago, Bird replied strenuously, "" No, no, we're professionals now."" True class! Though not terribly locquacious, Bird was dignified but tough; serious on the court, but displaying a cunning wit off it. And the DVD does a great job of magnifying these aspects, like his incredible court awareness, in interviews with teammates, coaches, and even the late Johnny Most, the Celtics radio voice.Included in the new package are three of Bird's most memorable (of many) NBA contests: the 1985 regular-season game where Bird torched the Atlanta Hawks for a club-high 60 points in New Orleans, a total still uneclipsed by a Boston Celtic up to this writing; the Bird-Dominique Wilkins shoot-out in the playoffs of 1988; and a double-O.T. twist with Clyde Drexler's Portland Trailblazers, in which the battered, beaten, soon-to-retire Larry dipped into the well for 49 points. These games were truly representative of what Bird did throughout his career, and they are well-chosen. The commentators for the 60-point game were Hawks announcers, though (!) The play-by-play man's ""Bullseye!"" outbursts were terribly annoying. However, it is a sheer delight to have this game on record; even the Atlanta players end up cheering for Bird as he nails shot after shot from downtown!The documentary is a sheer pleasure, but will leave the die-hard Celtics fan thirsting for more. But kudos to NBA Entertainment and Warner Bros. for opening up the vaults, allowing us to see in digital format this classic of basketball greatness.

846359,A343CRJ1JDE6RP,B0002V7U1Y,"J. M. Jacobs ""Just one man's opinion...""","[1, 1]","As a lifelong Celtics' fan minted in the early 60's, I unconsciously became schooled in the practice of selfless basketball as a winning formula: do not go for the individual stats, play in a manner that's good for the team, and play in such a fashion that your play makes your teammates better.This is something that many players never seem to realize.I just finished reading Bill Simmons ""The Book of Basketball"" and I envy him the days of his youth where his dad had a season ticket to the Celtics and took his son with him to all the games. At that time, a kid could go down courtside and retrieve basketballs from the missed shots during the shoot-around portion of the team's warm-up drills. Mr. Simmons had that privilege, so he is a pretty fair judge of what makes for a great basketball player and Larry Bird is certainly one of the best ever. Mr. Simmons talks about ""The Secret"" that great winning players know. It deals with giving up your personal goals to a degree that allows the team goals to take precedence.This set consists of two double-sided discs. The first side is a stunning documentary of Bird and his career. Watching it made me long for those days when Bird and his Celtics went to war with Magic and his Lakers. Back then, the style of play was more run-and-gun rather than the plodding half-court offenses we have today ad nauseum. Larry Bird at 6'-9"" running the Celtics fast break and making an eye-popping pass to hit the open man for a lay-up is as enjoyable a form of watching the game of basketball as exists for someone like me. Bird constantly searched for the easiest most reliable way for his team to score. It didn't have to always be him doing the scoring. He appeared to derive as much joy from a precision pass to set up a teammate for a score as making a shot himself.However, in crunch time Bird wanted the ball. He embraced the pressure and what it brought out in him as far as his champion's spirit. To borrow a phrase from Tiger Woods, Bird loved to 'step on the neck' of an opponent. In the manner in which he created their defeat, he wanted them to remember it... as possibly think about and fear it happening again. In their next meeting, those nagging little thoughts may give Bird and his fellow Celtics a tiny advantage... and in close games and championship series, that tiny edge can be the deciding factor.Larry Bird's abilities aside, no one did this 'intimidation' better than Michael Jordan.Side two of the 1st disc and both sides of the 2nd disc are complete games which really demonstrate just how good Larry Bird really was. He was so good at the shots he practiced hour after hour long before and long after his teammates were around for practice, but to see the shots he created out of what the situation offered is just marvelous.

I love the raw game (actual broadcasts in entirety) footage - the atlanta game when he scored 60 was amazing...the 4th quarter battle vs dominique wilkins was fantastic as well.  The Portland game was not that good - I wish they had the bird vs. pacers series!  Statistically the portland game was awesome for bird but he looked worn and old - not when he was in his prime.Bottom line though Bird was the best of all because he played unselfishly and still dominated by scoring.  He also could rebound and he was a true leader.  The video tells the story and the highlights are memorable...all of his great clutch last second shots are there, his no look passes and his relentless intensity.I really enjoyed watching the high school footage and his college stories.  I never knew some of the things Bird went through - the fact that he took Indiana State to an undefeated season going into champ game vs. Magic was miraculous in basketball terms.Bird was better than all - Bird played vs a great Lakers team and split championships with magic so he only won 3 rings...Jordan won 6 rings against flaky competition - barkley? karl malone? clyde drexler? aging magic? sean kemp?Bird passed the ball and played team basketball yet he still scored a lot - shows how he knew how to play the game and not hog the ball and dominate the offense...He lead his team through his work ethic and passion and even inspired his team to body slam the fast breaking lakers in 84 - Bird was the creator of the ""no lay-up"" rule in the NBA playoffs.  NBA today is about flash and scoring and money and physical competion and hard fouls are non existent....The NBA is kinda soft now...Tim Duncan is really an overated superstar of the league. Shaq and Kobe never would have won championships in the 80's or 90's.  Detroit was a journyman team that won a ring last year and showed how far the talent and intensity level had fallen in the NBA.You never fully appreciate great sportsmen and matchups until they are gone.

I respected them, sure, but I could never see myself rooting for them.That all changed when I first bought an NBA video entitled ""Larry Bird, A Basketball Legend"" way back in 1991.  I had just bought the Magic Johnson one, and wanted to see his greatest rival. While I am slightly disappointed with the flow of the story and am somewhat uncomfortable with the monotonous narration of Daniel Stern (hence the 4 star rating), I can safely say that the video did what I did not think possible: turn me into a Larry Bird fan.That was then.  Fast forward to recent history.  When I saw in Amazon that LBABL was being re-issued in DVD form, I jumped at the chance to get it.  Of course, it helped a lot to have classic Larry games included!The Pros: Nice game selection.  The video itself was moving.The Cons: Where was Game 5 of the 1991 Eastern First Round against Indiana?  I think no game defined Larry more than that one.

NBA games have a lot of slow moments. You have to either sit through them, or try to fast forward to the exciting parts of the game, but you end up missing many of the great moments.

846365,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0002V7U1Y,trebe,"[1, 1]","Quiet and unassuming, Larry Bird was not the most physically gifted athlete, but he became an NBA legend through hard work, determination, and playing with intelligence and heart.  A fierce competitor with a burning desire to win, Bird strived for excellence in all facets of the game, and was selected three times as the NBA Most Valuable Player.  A three time NBA champion, Bird also won an Olympic gold medal as part of the USA's `Dream Team', and is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame.Bird's basketball career is partially reviewed in the hour long documentary Larry Bird: A Basketball Legend.  The date of production is not stated in the credits, but it appears that the documentary was produced in 1991.  It begins with Bird's formative years growing up in French Lick, Indiana, his college career at Indiana State, and then his NBA career as a member of the Boston Celtics.  In 1979, Larry Bird led Indiana State to the NCAA title game against a Magic Johnson led Michigan State team.  Johnson's Spartan's claimed the title, but the Bird/Johnson rivalry was just beginning.  Bird's Celtics would battle Magic's Lakers for the NBA title three times in the 1980's, with the Lakers claiming victory twice.  Bird was Rookie of the Year in 1980, and helped reverse the fortunes of a floundering Celtic franchise, which made the biggest one season improvement in league history, going from 29-53 to 61-29.  While a great individual player, Bird made his teammates better with his unselfish play.  Winning was most important stat to Bird, who was one of the few superstars capable of taking over a game, or making a last second shot, when it was necessary.  Though slowed by age and injury, Bird would continue to give all he had whenever he was on the court.In addition to game highlights, the documentary has numerous commentaries from coaches, teammates, opponents, sportscasters, and basketball insiders.  Reviewing Larry Bird's career is no easy task.  The documentary does a good job, but still misses the mark in several areas.  The intense Celtic/76er rivalry, which often reached epic proportions in the early 80's, is just briefly touched upon.  The rivalry with Dr. J was quite intense. In 1984, in a game where Bird was outscoring Doc 42 to 6, the two superstars got into a scuffle where both were ejected.  Yet. there are no interviews with Julius Erving, or anyone from the 76ers.  Missing are any contribution from Cedric Maxwell, or Nate Archibald, key members on the Celtics teams of the early 80's.  Also missing are comments from any of the other great eastern conference players that regularly faced off against Bird, people like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, Dennis Rodman, Isaiah Thomas, Charles Barkley, Reggie Miller, Sidney Moncrieff, Bill Laimbeer, and Dominique Wilkins, just to name a few.  And that does not even consider players in the western conference.  Not mentioned is the lesser remembered, but more heated rivalry with Chuck `The Rifleman' Person of the Indiana Pacers.Larry Bird: A Basketball Legend, while a good retrospective in 1991, is a bit outdated in 2009.  After 1991, Bird was a member of the gold medal winning Olympic `Dream Team' in 1992, and retired from the NBA later that year.  He coached the Indiana Pacers from 1997 through 2000, with a record of 147 wins, and 67 losses, and a 68% winning percentage, taking them to the NBA Finals in 2000.  Bird was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998, and at this time is President of Basketball Operations for the Indiana Pacers.  Beginning as the fiercest of competitors, Magic and Larry are now close friends, with the deepest of mutual respect.  They each credit the other, with helping to make them the best player they could be.The set consists of two double sided discs.  The documentary is on Side A of Disc 1.  The rest of the material consists of complete games, in which Bird had note worthy performances.  On Side B of Disc 1 is a 1985 Celtic/Hawk contest, played in New Orleans where Bird scored a career high of 60 points.  On Side A of Disc 2 is Game Seven of the 1988 playoff series between the Celtics and the Hawks, a see-saw affair played at the Boston Garden, highlighted by a scoring duel between Bird and Dominique Wilkins.  On Side B of Disc 2 is an exciting 1992 double overtime thriller between Boston and Portland, where Bird scores a last second three to tie the game at the end of regulation, and then leads the Celtics to victory, finishing with 49 points and a triple double.Looking at the NBA today, where there seems to be less emphasis on the fundamentals, and where most teams struggle to score a hundred points, it's interesting to see how the game was played in the 80's, when most teams ran and pushed the ball up court.  The Celtics were such a great passing team, and it's marvelous to see them in action.  While the selected games show Bird scoring a lot of points, aside from the Hawk playoff game, these games don't really have great historical significance.  Why not feature one of the memorable Celtics/Lakers contests from the finals, or a Celtics/Sixer classic, or a game from one of the Celtics/Rockets finals?  There is room on the discs for some additional games.Although the feature documentary is outdated, and the selection of games could have been better, the set is a good value based on the amount of content.  A superlative player, who usually let his play on the court do the talking, Larry Bird helped make the NBA what it is today.",4,"nice retrospective, though outdated and with significant omissions  . .
