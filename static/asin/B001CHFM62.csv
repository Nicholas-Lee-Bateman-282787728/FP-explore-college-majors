These DVDs are mastered from clean new prints, which I've never seen before.  Looks great, although I was hoping they'd be the time-worn 16mm TV prints I grew up with.  Also, these DVDs all have the Japanese intros, not the ones that aired on American TV.  The closing title montages that were on American syndicated versions is also missing, since it wasn't part of the original Japanese program.  Still, some of them hold up quite well and it's refreshing to see the world I was born into (I am exact same age of this show).

Its guys running around in monster suits doing flips and flops but its pretty awesome if you watched the show as a little boy. It is the full series and no its has not been remastered for DVD or Blu-ray. So if you think its going to look better then you remember it looking, or sound better, NOPE. It is completely watchable in its not 3d or non 5:1 dolby digital surround sound ness and is great fun. On a side note, since this was a Christmas present and had not even though of the show in years. I did a quick google search and found out that Ultra man is still being made today. On a trip to youtube,the show has changed cast several times and apparently there are other ultra men now but its still guys in monster suit running around except now you can't see the zipper.

1176401,A309XDJNYKCFJE,B001CHFM62,Afghan Contractor,"[17, 18]","As someone born shortly after the show finished, I saw the episodes as a child in syndication in Detroit in the late 70's on WXON (TV 20). I have observed various incarnations of the ""complete"" series both here and on various other web sites, but never at less than $10. When I saw this box set, I knew I had to add it to my order.My review:Packaging: The four DVD set comes in a single plastic case, the four DVDs inside are protected from scratches by being further packaged in CD envelopes (I actually like and appreciate this!). The case did arrive to me (all the way in Afghanistan) with a corner cracked (no DVDs were damaged). One hit to Amazon for a crushed box that had no filler inside (popcorn or airbags).DVDs: The 39 episode series is from the mid-to-late 60's, so I expected very little quality increase from the episodes available on YouTube. I was surprised to find the quality of this set was actually excellent! The main menu features the title song (in Japanese) and a short clip of Ultraman. You can change the available languages from Japanese (default) to English. The final DVD has bonus interviews with the dub & voiceover actors and a nice slideshow of the monsters.The episodes are shown in their entirety. This means that when certain scenes were clipped in the U.S. dubbed version, they appear in the episode (not dubbed, but in Japanese with English subtitles). This is where some people are not happy with the series. I did not mind it at all, as it happens very infrequently. I do remember, however, that some of the scenes were actually dubbed and I viewed them as a child on TV. I don't know what happened to the dubbed scenes, but I am still happy with the final product.At less than $10, how can you go wrong?

To my relief, this copy is in very good condition and plays well.  There is a lot of action in these Ultraman shows, even though it's pretty cheesy production values.  You can tell the sets and props are miniatures.  You have the option of watching the shows in the original Japanese, with English subtitles, or watching the shows dubbed in English.  On the last video, there is an interview with the actors who voiced the old ""Speed Racer"" cartoon, who also did the dubbing for the English version of Ultraman.  It had been so long since I had seen this series, I really did not remember any of the episodes, other than just bits and pieces.  It brought back memories of my childhood watching the series and hearing the music.  Boy, the Japanese really love their monsters!  That's all Ultraman ever fought-monsters and mutated plants.

One day, a Science Patrol member named Hayata crashes his spacecraft into another vessel from the nebula M-78. Ultraman, an alien superhero in pursuit of a dangerous spacefaring monster, was in that craft. He offers his own life to save that of Hayata, and from then on Hayata may use Ultraman's Beta Capsule to transform into the colossal superhero. The catch is that his energy depletes rapidly in Earth's atmosphere, and if Ultraman doesn't revert back to Hayata's human form, he will &#34;never rise again.&#34; Egad, what a premise.Each episode generally follows the Science Patrol as they investigate some strange phenomenon, always ending in the appearance of a kaiju-sized monster that Ultraman has to fight. The monster costumes are awesomely campy, as are the special effects, and the plotlines are usually filled with little kid logic. I love it.This show is intended for young children, but I found it to be extremely enjoyable, probably because I'm such a godzilla fan. It does have moments in which monsters bleed and lose body parts, but the special effects are very campy, so I doubt it would give any little kids nightmares.In short this show is just plain fun, and I heartily recommend it to kaiju fans. If you're looking for a more mature viewing experience, however, I suggest watching Ultraman: Into the Future instead. It is a more serious take on Ultraman.",5,Great show,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,1732,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'Godzilla', 'movies', 'particularly', 'showa', 'ones', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'just', 'campy', 'monster', 'movies', 'general', 'invite', 'give', 'Ultraman', 'watch.Ultraman', 'show', 'japanese', 'team', 'scientists', 'Science', 'Patrol', 'serve', 'earth', 'defense', 'aliens', 'other', 'monsters', 'as', 'well', 'disasters', 'kind', 'One', 'day', 'Science', 'Patrol', 'member', 'named', 'Hayata', 'crashes', 'spacecraft', 'vessel', 'nebula', 'M-78', 'Ultraman', 'alien', 'superhero', 'pursuit', 'dangerous', 'spacefaring', 'monster', 'was', 'craft', 'own', 'life', 'save', 'Hayata', 'then', 'Hayata', 'may', 'use', 'Ultraman', 'Beta', 'Capsule', 'transform', 'colossal', 'superhero', 'catch', 'energy', 'depletes', 'rapidly', 'Earth', 'atmosphere', 'Ultraman', ""n't"", 'revert', 'back', 'Hayata', 'human', 'form', 'will', '34', 'never', 'rise', 'again.', '34', 'Egad', 'what', 'premise.Each', 'episode', 'generally', 'Science', 'Patrol', 'investigate', 'strange', 'phenomenon', 'always', 'ending', 'appearance', 'kaiju-sized', 'monster', 'Ultraman', 'fight', 'monster', 'costumes', 'are', 'awesomely', 'campy', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'plotlines', 'are', 'usually', 'filled', 'little', 'kid', 'logic', 'love', 'it.This', 'show', 'intended', 'young', 'children', 'found', 'be', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'probably', ""'m"", 'such', 'godzilla', 'fan', 'have', 'moments', 'monsters', 'bleed', 'lose', 'body', 'parts', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'campy', 'so', 'doubt', 'would', 'give', 'little', 'kids', 'nightmares.In', 'short', 'show', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'kaiju', 'fans', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'mature', 'viewing', 'experience', 'however', 'suggest', 'watching', 'Ultraman', 'Future', 'instead', 'more', 'serious', 'take', 'Ultraman']",Ultraman: The Complete Series

Amazon has had this priced at $4.99 for months now, and at that price you'd be insane NOT to buy it.  Yes, the packaging is non-standard, but it's not as bad as some people make it out to be; the set comes in a big, sturdy plastic clamshell case and the four DVDs are in paper sleeves which are held in place by four black plastic ""corner"" pieces which form a sort of ""frame"" for them inside the case.  Non-standard, sure, but the discs do stay in place and the packaging is still sturdy and sound.  Some people also complain about the few non-English scenes; all they've done is insert a few deleted scenes that were never dubbed into English because they got cut the first time.  They only pop up once in a while and aren't a big deal.  And considering the low quality---both picture and sound---of the original show, the quality of this set is pretty darn good!

Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[51, 53]","It is true that if you already have the previous, two box sets, (Volumes 1 and 2), then this full collection is not needed, BUT, if you are an Ultraman fan from way back, then this new collection is well worth having if you don't already own the previous, two volume collections.I think it is amazing that this set is even available. This is quite enjoyable for me, having seen these episodes on broadcast TV, way back in the 1970s.This collection is a bit of a labor of love, perhaps more so than it being a major commercial studio release. So, at times it may seem rough around some edges, yet, I say again, it is a wonder that these episodes are even available, and even more complete than they appeared on 1970s TV in the USA, nearly four decades ago.A lot of creative talent overlaps the Godzilla films of the 1960s and 1970s, so if you like those Godzilla films, then this TV series is pretty similar. It leans to the more kid-friendly aspects of the Godzilla films.The only thing you should be warned about is to not be confused by the added footage that never appeared on TV in the USA. Imagine if the DVD makers of this set were able to round up all the deleted scenes that were cut from each episode, well, they have! But, instead of putting them on the DVD as a Bonus Feature, separate from each episode, they have done it better by restoring these cut scenes and footage right back into their natural continuity of each episode. Here's the catch: this restored footage was never dubbed into English for TV in the USA, so there is no English dialog recorded. The DVD makers had to just use the original Japanese language audio with English sub-titles for these extra scenes.I don't mind. It is easy to get used to it, once you understand the situation.I can highly recommend this DVD set to anybody who fondly remembers these old Ultraman episodes from way back, or for any fans of the Godzilla films.

It also really isn't clear how the orange and white jumpsuited Science Patrol team handled these giant monsters before one of their members became a shared entity with an equally giant monster fighting hero, but that is only a thought that occurred to me in the clarity of age :-) Also, while the rubber suited monsters, special effects, and plots are often almost laughable by today's standards, they truly amazed and enthralled me back then and still ""work"" for me from a reminiscing standpoint.It is wonderful to have the whole series on DVD and I really enjoyed seeing scenes that had been cut from the US broadcast (included with subtitles since they were never voiced over in English).Highly Recommended!CFH",5,Great Series From My Childhood - Highly Recommended,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,1159,"['Ultraman', 'Complete', 'Series', 'was', 'great', 'find', 'loved', 'show', 'growing', 'up', 'late', ""'60s"", 'early', ""'70s"", 'wanted', 'share', 'family.This', 'was', 'amazing', 'series', 'Japan', 'featured', 'pseudo-military', 'organization', 'known', 'Science', 'Patrol', 'utilized', 'coolest', 'equipment', 'weapons', 'fight', 'giant', 'monsters', 'seemed', 'only', 'want', 'terrorized', 'Japan', 'would', 'have', 'moved', '2nd', '3rd', 'one', 'showed', 'also', 'really', ""n't"", 'clear', 'how', 'orange', 'white', 'jumpsuited', 'Science', 'Patrol', 'team', 'handled', 'giant', 'monsters', 'one', 'members', 'became', 'shared', 'entity', 'equally', 'giant', 'monster', 'fighting', 'hero', 'only', 'thought', 'occurred', 'clarity', 'age', 'Also', 'rubber', 'suited', 'monsters', 'special', 'effects', 'plots', 'are', 'often', 'almost', 'laughable', 'today', 'standards', 'truly', 'amazed', 'enthralled', 'back', 'then', 'still', 'work', 'reminiscing', 'standpoint.It', 'wonderful', 'have', 'whole', 'series', 'DVD', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'scenes', 'had', 'been', 'cut', 'US', 'broadcast', 'included', 'subtitles', 'were', 'never', 'voiced', 'English', '.Highly', 'Recommended', 'CFH']",Ultraman: The Complete Series

But the rubber costumed monsters looked crappy and i hated that they recycled some of the costumes several times.They would just modify it by adding tails, different textures, colors, feathers, and other attachments. Especially the Godzilla type monster design. You can tell by the basic design that it was the same one from previous episode.Modern TV shows like Power Rangers, Beatle Borg were inspired by Ultraman, but Ultraman can kick all their butts put together! His fighting style is a combination of wrestling, judo and street fighting. On top of that he doesn't need to shoot any guns or ""zwords"",  because he shoots lasers from his hands, create energy Shields and use telekinesis!The science patrol team grew on me and i enjoyed their banter in each episode, they also became more effectual when they attacked monsters with more advanced weaponry. Hayata, (the human whom transforms into Ultraman ), was a very likable character, very confident, good sense of humor and was always trying to be supportive of his team.Some episodes surprised me as the,monsters didnt always die the same way, and it wasnt always Ultraman that defeated them. There's even an episode where Ultraman shows mercy and helps a monster leave earth. He is a true heroe indeed.The only reason i deducted one star is because the packaging is bad. The distributors compressed 39 episodes onto 4 DVD discs. The sound quality suffers and the visuals were a bit grainy. Also the English dub actors were terrible. So i prefer the English sub with Japanese audio.  But hey, its at budget price and im a new fan.By the 13th episode, Ultraman also became a better fighter and i noticed he was more aggressive against the monsters. His laser blast, and other special effects have held up well in my opininon. I just got excited when he came into action. Great show!",4,"My Hero!

It was all in the American editing of the show. Basically all the scenes that have Japanese language with English subtitling is just the full uncut episodes fully restored and those scenes were never in english to begin with.

These shows are FANTASTIC, I'm sure they were fun at the time, but so many years later, and through the filter of subtitles (you must watch these with the original Japanese dialog!) they are impossibly great!Exciting, imaginative stories with monsters and the heroic Space Patrol team plus the cheapest special effects possible from the era before computer graphics ruined everyone's appetite -- these shows are to be LOVED! From the cheesy theme song to the inevitable appearance of Ultraman (and the vanquishing of the monster), every single second is thoroughly enjoyable.It's the kind of entertainment that could not be created today. People are too cynical. Special effects are too slick. No one makes models anymore. No one pulls on a rubber monster suit and crushes a skyline. There are no cool Space Patrol type of heroes who leap into their extremely cool silver VTOL ship to battle evil.I guess this is a more innocent version of Power Rangers. Without spliced-in English-speaking substitutes for the original heroes in the series. It's formulaic, but it's innocent and HONEST. I just love these shows.

Sadly after sitting through several episodes I was ready to gag.  I must have been an easy to please kid if I did enjoy this in those long ago days.Almost every episode is the same.  Giant monster (or alien who can transform into a giant) appears, the heroes of the Science Patrol and the military fail to stop it, lead hero uses his Beta capsule to transform into the giant super hero Ultra Man, who fist fights the monster until the warning light located on his chest starts to beep and the narrator warns that if the light goes off Ultraman will never rise again, Ultraman then crosses his hands sending a blast that destroys the monster.  Ultraman then files off into the sunset. And so it goes episode after episode.  Sometimes the build up to the monster's first appearence is different but in the long run the episodes rarely differ.This is a show that has to be taken in small doses in order to be enjoyed  and will only appeal to adults who have fond memories of it from their youth.  Today's jade youth so use to seeing CGI effects may be bored by the cheezee monster suits (a redressed old Godzilla costume shows up in one episode) worn by the stuntmen and the dated model work.  A very interesting thing about Ultraman is that it is one of the very first TV shows that I was exposed to that had a definite beginning and an end.As to the collection itself these appear to be unedited episodes of the show.  The theme song last longer than I remember and has more verses to it.  Also the dubbing kicks out at times and subtitles are used.  I have no way to prove this but I suspect that when the series was first dubbed for American release the episodes were edited down for more commericals and the portions not used were not dubbed. For this release of the unedited episodes subtitles are used for the undubbed moments. So for Ultraman fan out there (and I do know that they are out there)he is sure to get his money's worth with this collection.",2,Fun in very small doses,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,2058,"['bought', 'Ultraman', 'Complete', 'Series', 'hope', 'returning', 'long', 'ago', 'days', 'innocences', 'Sadly', 'sitting', 'several', 'episodes', 'was', 'ready', 'gag', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'please', 'kid', 'did', 'enjoy', 'long', 'ago', 'days.Almost', 'episode', 'same', 'Giant', 'monster', 'alien', 'who', 'can', 'transform', 'giant', 'heroes', 'Science', 'Patrol', 'military', 'fail', 'stop', 'lead', 'hero', 'Beta', 'capsule', 'transform', 'giant', 'super', 'hero', 'Ultra', 'Man', 'who', 'fist', 'fights', 'monster', 'warning', 'light', 'located', 'chest', 'beep', 'narrator', 'light', 'Ultraman', 'will', 'never', 'rise', 'again', 'Ultraman', 'then', 'hands', 'sending', 'blast', 'monster', 'Ultraman', 'then', 'sunset', 'episode', 'episode', 'Sometimes', 'build', 'up', 'monster', 'first', 'appearence', 'different', 'long', 'run', 'episodes', 'rarely', 'differ.This', 'show', 'be', 'taken', 'small', 'doses', 'order', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'will', 'only', 'appeal', 'adults', 'who', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'youth', 'Today', 'jade', 'youth', 'so', 'use', 'seeing', 'CGI', 'effects', 'may', 'be', 'bored', 'cheezee', 'monster', 'suits', 'redressed', 'old', 'Godzilla', 'costume', 'up', 'one', 'episode', 'worn', 'stuntmen', 'dated', 'model', 'work', 'very', 'interesting', 'thing', 'Ultraman', 'one', 'very', 'first', 'TV', 'shows', 'was', 'exposed', 'had', 'definite', 'beginning', 'end.As', 'collection', 'appear', 'be', 'unedited', 'episodes', 'show', 'theme', 'song', 'last', 'longer', 'remember', 'more', 'verses', 'Also', 'dubbing', 'out', 'times', 'subtitles', 'are', 'used', 'have', 'way', 'prove', 'suspect', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'dubbed', 'American', 'release', 'episodes', 'were', 'edited', 'down', 'more', 'commericals', 'portions', 'not', 'used', 'were', 'not', 'dubbed', 'release', 'unedited', 'episodes', 'subtitles', 'are', 'used', 'undubbed', 'moments', 'So', 'Ultraman', 'fan', 'there', 'do', 'know', 'are', 'there', 'sure', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'collection']",Ultraman: The Complete Series

If you have children this is the perfect opportunity to show them a series with substance that inspires thought and creativity instead of the nonsense that is aired these days.However, having said that, I am a little disappointed in these last two DVD releases (this one and the 2006 release) for a couple of key reasons:First off, not all of the dubbed English is present.  It is not because it doesn't exist anymore; in 1996 a video tape was released to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the show.  It was labeled Vol. 1 and contained the first four episodes.When I first watched the DVDs I realized that dialogue spoken in Japanese was definitely aired with an English dub.  I compared a couple of scenes with the videotape and those scenes were definitely aired in English.I think what has happened with these DVD releases is that they reflect copyright and distribution battles between companies.  This is why it took so long to release the series in the first place.  The research was sloppy and hurried.  With more time and care invested I think they could have incorporated most of the missing English.  It is definitely available since various versions of the series have existed in one form or another throughout the years.The other thing that bothers me is that they used the Japanese opening credits instead of the English version.  This is an American release intended to be purchased and viewed by Americans.  The show has always been available in Japan but here in the United States children saw English titles.For me personally, the credits and theme songs are just as important as the contents of the show in order to recreate the original experience of having watched these shows as a kid back in the early '70s.Overall, it is wonderful that the series has finally been released in the United States.  If you loved this show you will love watching these discs.I just wish that someone would release Ultraman, Space Giants and Johnny Sokko as they were presented on American TV with all English dubbing intact and all opening/closing credits (and themes) intact.If you are fortunate enough to speak and understand Japanese you could have bought imports of the show all along in their native environments but the opening credits and theme songs that we have come to know are different and should have been preserved for an American release.",4,Ultraman: The Complete Series,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",2009,2509,"['were', 'kid', 'early', ""'70s"", 'remember', 'being', 'glued', 'TV', 'watching', 'Ultraman', 'then', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'buying', 'DVD', 'release', 'have', 'children', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'show', 'series', 'substance', 'thought', 'creativity', 'instead', 'nonsense', 'aired', 'days.However', 'having', 'said', 'am', 'little', 'disappointed', 'last', 'two', 'DVD', 'releases', 'one', '2006', 'release', 'couple', 'key', 'reasons', 'First', 'off', 'not', 'dubbed', 'English', 'present', 'not', ""n't"", 'exist', 'anymore', '1996', 'video', 'tape', 'was', 'released', 'celebrate', '30th', 'anniversary', 'show', 'was', 'labeled', 'Vol', '1', 'contained', 'first', 'four', 'episodes.When', 'first', 'watched', 'DVDs', 'realized', 'dialogue', 'spoken', 'Japanese', 'was', 'definitely', 'aired', 'English', 'dub', 'compared', 'couple', 'scenes', 'videotape', 'scenes', 'were', 'definitely', 'aired', 'English.I', 'think', 'happened', 'DVD', 'releases', 'reflect', 'copyright', 'distribution', 'battles', 'companies', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'release', 'series', 'first', 'place', 'research', 'was', 'sloppy', 'hurried', 'more', 'time', 'care', 'invested', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'incorporated', 'most', 'missing', 'English', 'definitely', 'available', 'various', 'versions', 'series', 'have', 'existed', 'one', 'form', 'years.The', 'other', 'thing', 'bothers', 'used', 'Japanese', 'opening', 'credits', 'instead', 'English', 'version', 'American', 'release', 'intended', 'be', 'purchased', 'viewed', 'Americans', 'show', 'always', 'been', 'available', 'Japan', 'here', 'United', 'States', 'children', 'saw', 'English', 'personally', 'credits', 'theme', 'songs', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'contents', 'show', 'order', 'recreate', 'original', 'experience', 'having', 'watched', 'shows', 'kid', 'back', 'early', ""'70s.Overall"", 'wonderful', 'series', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'United', 'States', 'loved', 'show', 'will', 'love', 'watching', 'discs.I', 'just', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'release', 'Ultraman', 'Space', 'Giants', 'Johnny', 'Sokko', 'were', 'presented', 'American', 'TV', 'English', 'dubbing', 'intact', 'opening/closing', 'credits', 'themes', 'intact.If', 'are', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'speak', 'understand', 'Japanese', 'could', 'have', 'bought', 'imports', 'show', 'native', 'environments', 'opening', 'credits', 'theme', 'songs', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'are', 'different', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'preserved', 'American', 'release']",Ultraman: The Complete Series

Many years later I even wondered if I hadn't just imagined it. Then I saw some VHS bootlegs of this show for sale in a magazine. I purchased them. They were just ok quality. However this release, while not perfect, blows those away in terms of picture quality. Of course when I was a kid these were all too cool now they are great corny fun. Very campy. Now I hope they put out Ultra Seven which was a series that came after this.

This series is classic Japanese monster movie type stuff; it's a must-have for lovers of this genre. I recommend this series for something totally different than what kids are accustomed to today. I think it would generate lots of interest and lots of laughs.

If you think all these American super hero is cool, you have not seen anything until you see Ultraman. But growing up in Japan would be entirely different than if you were to just grow up in America thinking this is just a made up Asian whatever film! You have to be in it spiritually, culturally, and historically to see the beauty and power of this film. This is THE number one, the MOST biggest, popular, famous action figure on our planet~!!!!!! I would LOVE to see Ultraman A, Ultraman Seven, and Return of Ultraman DVD BOX series ~!!! I may just go home to Japan and bring it to the USA. These are just CLASSIC. MUST HAVE. Watch it in Japanese, and all the Theme song HAS TO BE in ORIGINAL Japanese version which is 100 times better!!!!!",5,THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION EVER~!,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,823,"['Konnichiwa', 'hey', 'can', 'not', 'talk', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'Ultraman', 'series', 'think', 'American', 'super', 'hero', 'cool', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'anything', 'see', 'Ultraman', 'growing', 'up', 'Japan', 'would', 'be', 'entirely', 'different', 'were', 'just', 'grow', 'up', 'America', 'thinking', 'just', 'made', 'up', 'Asian', 'whatever', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'spiritually', 'culturally', 'historically', 'see', 'beauty', 'power', 'film', 'number', 'one', 'MOST', 'biggest', 'popular', 'famous', 'action', 'figure', 'planet~', 'would', 'LOVE', 'see', 'Ultraman', 'A', 'Ultraman', 'Seven', 'Return', 'Ultraman', 'DVD', 'BOX', 'series', '~', 'may', 'just', 'go', 'home', 'Japan', 'bring', 'USA', 'are', 'just', 'CLASSIC', 'MUST', 'HAVE', 'Watch', 'Japanese', 'Theme', 'song', 'HAS', 'TO', 'BE', 'ORIGINAL', 'Japanese', 'version', '100', 'times', 'better']",Ultraman: The Complete Series
