1497909,AYDSX1WZ4NU17,B005R1V0QA,Daryl Chin,"[8, 8]","Edmund Goulding was a stylish director who began as a writer on Broadway. He was one of the first directors to be signed by the fledgling company Metro-Goldwyn in the mid-1920s; he wrote and/or directed some of that studio's biggest successes (THE BROADWAY MELODY, GRAND HOTEL) before moving over to Warner Brothers, where he again directed notable successes (including four films starring Bette Davis, such as DARK VICTORY). By 1943, he was again on the move, going from Warners to 20th Century Fox; CLAUDIA was the first film he would directed for Fox.The history of CLAUDIA is rather tangled. It had been a successful play on Broadway, and made a star of its young actress Dorothy McGuire. The rights were purchased by David O. Selznick, who also signed McGuire to a contract. But Selznick began concentrating on other projects, and soon sold the property to Fox; as with GONE WITH THE WIND, there was publicity generated because of the testing of several actresses for the lead, though the part was eventually given to McGuire for her screen debut.Goulding directed CLAUDIA in a very fluid manner; he doesn't try to ""open up"" the play, but he moves to camera around the setting of the country house in a very free manner. The cast is delightful, with the great stage comedienne Ina Claire giving a moving performance as Claudia's mother, and Robert Young providing warmth and humor as Claudia's husband. Dorothy McGuire is excellent: the character may seem cloying at times according to modern standards, but McGuire as an actress never wavers and expertly weaves the various moods together.I have to say, this DV-R is adequate, but the film print has not been restored. At times, it is rather dark (especially at the beginning) and there are a few marks on the film print. As with most of these made-on-demand discs, this is bare-bones, but CLAUDIA is one of those movies that was a great success in its time (it even occasioned a sequel, CLAUDIA AND DAVID, which is also available) but is now not as well known. It's an example of the domestic comedies which were part of the culture in the 1940s, on Broadway and in the movies, a genre which would soon move over to TV (OZZIE AND HARRIET, I LOVE LUCY, THE DONNA REED SHOW, etc.). But CLAUDIA is a fine example, though the disc is only fair.",4,Bygone charm,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,2297,"['Goulding', 'was', 'stylish', 'director', 'who', 'began', 'writer', 'Broadway', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'directors', 'be', 'signed', 'fledgling', 'company', 'Metro-Goldwyn', 'mid-1920s', 'wrote', 'and/or', 'directed', 'studio', 'biggest', 'successes', 'BROADWAY', 'MELODY', 'GRAND', 'HOTEL', 'moving', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'where', 'again', 'directed', 'notable', 'successes', 'including', 'four', 'films', 'starring', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'such', 'DARK', 'VICTORY', '1943', 'was', 'again', 'move', 'going', 'Warners', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'CLAUDIA', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'would', 'directed', 'Fox.The', 'history', 'CLAUDIA', 'rather', 'tangled', 'had', 'been', 'successful', 'play', 'Broadway', 'made', 'star', 'young', 'actress', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'rights', 'were', 'purchased', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'who', 'also', 'signed', 'McGuire', 'contract', 'Selznick', 'began', 'concentrating', 'other', 'projects', 'soon', 'sold', 'property', 'Fox', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'was', 'publicity', 'generated', 'testing', 'several', 'actresses', 'lead', 'part', 'was', 'eventually', 'given', 'McGuire', 'screen', 'debut.Goulding', 'directed', 'CLAUDIA', 'very', 'fluid', 'manner', ""n't"", 'try', 'open', 'up', 'play', 'camera', 'setting', 'country', 'house', 'very', 'free', 'manner', 'cast', 'delightful', 'great', 'stage', 'comedienne', 'Ina', 'Claire', 'giving', 'moving', 'performance', 'Claudia', 'mother', 'Robert', 'Young', 'providing', 'warmth', 'humor', 'Claudia', 'husband', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'excellent', 'character', 'may', 'seem', 'cloying', 'times', 'according', 'modern', 'standards', 'McGuire', 'actress', 'never', 'wavers', 'expertly', 'various', 'moods', 'have', 'say', 'DV-R', 'adequate', 'film', 'print', 'not', 'been', 'restored', 'times', 'rather', 'dark', 'especially', 'beginning', 'are', 'few', 'marks', 'film', 'print', 'most', 'made-on-demand', 'discs', 'bare-bones', 'CLAUDIA', 'one', 'movies', 'was', 'great', 'success', 'time', 'even', 'occasioned', 'sequel', 'CLAUDIA', 'AND', 'DAVID', 'also', 'available', 'now', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'example', 'domestic', 'comedies', 'were', 'part', 'culture', '1940s', 'Broadway', 'movies', 'genre', 'would', 'soon', 'move', 'TV', 'OZZIE', 'AND', 'HARRIET', 'LOVE', 'LUCY', 'THE', 'DONNA', 'REED', 'SHOW', 'etc.', 'CLAUDIA', 'fine', 'example', 'disc', 'only', 'fair']",Claudia (1943)

1497912,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B005R1V0QA,Kevin Killian,"[1, 2]","A Broadway success for Dorothy McGuire, the movie version got her signed to a contract with Selznick and she became one of his stable of beloved, often quirky stars.  He must have liked them that way, like Jennifer Jones and Ingrid Bergman.Claudia is a great role for an actress, but I don't suppose just ay talenbted actress could have carried it off, and McGuire is note perfect.  Does she look twenty?  Some of the time.  And her scatterbrained comments on everything from kittens to ketchup will have you scratching your head in delight.  Critic Molly Haskell in her classic From Reverence to Rape, while praising McGuire's sheer adorability and comic gifts, criticized the script for making McGuire into an artificial child who is afraid of full marital sex and plagued by the requirement to be a great housekeeper, but when you watch Claudia, at least today, she seems always eager for sex and she doesn't care a fig about housekeeping.  And yet there is that weird energy about Claudia, she's too childlike and willful to be an actual adult; she lacks the reality principle that keeps most of us locked up tight emotionally.  Robert Young plays off of this beautifully; you can see why he's drawn to her extreme sensuality, but a little bit afraid for her mental stability.  The actresses of the sixties who pioneered mental anguish (Glenda Jackson, Liv Ullmann, Anne Bancroft) actually were taking a leaf from McGuire's book, for when Claudia is down, man, she is really really in a dark dark place.Ina Claire playing Mrs. Brown, Claudia's mother, is also perfect in the part, although perhaps too beautiful and serene and witty.  How old was she anyway?  She should have kept up in the movies for decades more after this!  And the other characters (like Ina Claire, sophisticated foils for McGuire's innocent if slightly deranged goodness) are put through their paces by ""women's director"" Edmund Goulding.  I sometimes think Goulding is the actual George Cukor and Cukor a second or third rate Edmund Goulding: is that sacrilegious to say?  I love his fussy, yet bold camera swoops and turns.  Watch what happens when Bertha answers the phone inside the country cottage, calls out to David (Robert Young) to come and answer the phone; he's outside in the courtyard having a smoke, but he leaves way over to the far side of the screen and enters the house so you see him cross through a nest of silvery and gauze-festooned glass, finally picking up the phone--then reversing and bringing the whole apparatus out of the house again.  We're watching all this movement, wondering why Goulding allows it so much time, and we don't realize until the very end of the scene that (spoiler ahead) McGuire has been listening in on the phone conversation that follows, and it devastates her.  As Douglas Sirk lets the TV in All That Heaven Allows become a piece of furniture of symbolic dystopia, the windows, the walls, that Robert Young walks among reveal to us his confusion, his passion, his anxiety and his pride.  He is among the greatest movie actors of all time, much greater than his successors, Robert Mitchum, Robert Redford, Robert DeNiro, Robert Pattinson; and yet, we can't see him ""acting"" so we think he's just Marcus Welby Knows Best.",5,A Problem Like Claudia,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,3249,"['Broadway', 'success', 'Dorothy', 'McGuire', 'movie', 'version', 'got', 'signed', 'contract', 'Selznick', 'became', 'one', 'stable', 'beloved', 'often', 'quirky', 'stars', 'must', 'have', 'liked', 'way', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman.Claudia', 'great', 'role', 'actress', 'do', ""n't"", 'suppose', 'just', 'ay', 'talenbted', 'actress', 'could', 'have', 'carried', 'off', 'McGuire', 'note', 'perfect', 'look', 'twenty', 'time', 'scatterbrained', 'comments', 'everything', 'kittens', 'ketchup', 'will', 'have', 'scratching', 'head', 'delight', 'Critic', 'Molly', 'Haskell', 'classic', 'From', 'Reverence', 'Rape', 'praising', 'McGuire', 'sheer', 'adorability', 'comic', 'gifts', 'criticized', 'script', 'making', 'McGuire', 'artificial', 'child', 'who', 'afraid', 'full', 'marital', 'sex', 'plagued', 'requirement', 'be', 'great', 'housekeeper', 'when', 'watch', 'Claudia', 'least', 'today', 'always', 'eager', 'sex', ""n't"", 'care', 'fig', 'housekeeping', 'yet', 'weird', 'energy', 'Claudia', 'too', 'childlike', 'willful', 'be', 'actual', 'adult', 'reality', 'principle', 'most', 'locked', 'up', 'tight', 'emotionally', 'Robert', 'Young', 'beautifully', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'drawn', 'extreme', 'sensuality', 'little', 'bit', 'afraid', 'mental', 'stability', 'actresses', 'sixties', 'who', 'pioneered', 'mental', 'anguish', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'actually', 'were', 'taking', 'leaf', 'McGuire', 'book', 'when', 'Claudia', 'down', 'man', 'really', 'really', 'dark', 'dark', 'place.Ina', 'Claire', 'playing', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'Claudia', 'mother', 'also', 'perfect', 'part', 'perhaps', 'too', 'beautiful', 'serene', 'witty', 'How', 'old', 'was', 'anyway', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'up', 'movies', 'decades', 'more', 'other', 'characters', 'Ina', 'Claire', 'sophisticated', 'foils', 'McGuire', 'innocent', 'slightly', 'deranged', 'goodness', 'are', 'put', 'paces', 'women', 'director', 'Edmund', 'Goulding', 'sometimes', 'think', 'Goulding', 'actual', 'George', 'Cukor', 'Cukor', 'second', 'third', 'rate', 'Edmund', 'Goulding', 'sacrilegious', 'say', 'love', 'fussy', 'yet', 'bold', 'camera', 'swoops', 'turns', 'Watch', 'what', 'when', 'Bertha', 'phone', 'country', 'cottage', 'out', 'David', 'Robert', 'Young', 'come', 'answer', 'phone', 'outside', 'courtyard', 'having', 'smoke', 'way', 'far', 'side', 'screen', 'house', 'see', 'cross', 'nest', 'silvery', 'gauze-festooned', 'glass', 'finally', 'picking', 'up', 'phone', 'then', 'reversing', 'bringing', 'whole', 'apparatus', 'house', 'again', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movement', 'wondering', 'why', 'Goulding', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'very', 'end', 'scene', 'spoiler', 'ahead', 'McGuire', 'been', 'listening', 'phone', 'conversation', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'TV', 'Heaven', 'Allows', 'become', 'piece', 'furniture', 'symbolic', 'dystopia', 'windows', 'walls', 'Robert', 'Young', 'walks', 'reveal', 'confusion', 'passion', 'anxiety', 'pride', 'greatest', 'movie', 'actors', 'time', 'much', 'greater', 'successors', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'acting', 'think', 'just', 'Marcus', 'Welby', 'Knows', 'Best']",Claudia (1943)

1497915,ACM90BRKX73OG,B005R1V0QA,Tom,"[1, 1]","Claudia (1943) was directed by Edmund Goulding for Twentieth Century Fox and featured 27-year-old Dorothy McGuire in her film debut.Architect David Naughton (Robert Young) and his child bride (McGuire) make their home on a Connecticut farm. Claudia is more girl than woman and repeatedly tests the patience of her husband. When Claudia learns on the same day that she is pregnant and that her mother (Ina Claire) is terminally ill she must grow up quickly.Dorothy McGuire is absolutely lovely as the precocious woman-child, full of unbridled enthusiasm and constantly running from room to room and scurrying through windows. Male viewers will fall in love with this natural beauty. Both Olga Baclanova and Reginald Gardiner are outstanding in their small comedic roles as the headstrong Russian opera singer and the refined English cad. Robert Young does a great job as the tolerant husband. Goulding deftly follows the actors from room to room in seamlessly long takes. Exceedingly quaint by today's standards, Claudia is a pleasant look back to a much simpler time. You'll laugh and you'll cry. I'm sure Claudia's uplifting and reassuring message resonated with its wartime audience.Dorothy McGuire (1916-2001) made her stage debut in Omaha, Nebraska opposite Henry Fonda in 1930. She was mentored by Dorothy Pennebaker Brando, the mother of Marlon Brando. Dorothy went on to star in the Broadway production of Claudia from 1941 to 1943 and reprised her role in this 1943 film adaptation. Despite the great promise she showed in Claudia and several of her following films in which she often played difficult parts - The Enchanted Cottage (1945), A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945), The Spiral Staircase (1945), Claudia and David (1946), Till the End of Time (1946), and Gentleman's Agreement (1947) in her Oscar nominated role - McGuire never quite achieved Hollywood A-list status. However she will always be remembered for her remarkable natural beauty and lovely soft-spoken manner. She was an absolute gem of an actress.As a few other reviewers have noted, this DVD-R of Claudia is not the greatest quality. The contrast is too dark and the focus is not crisp.
