334869,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302795451,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","This is not a big spectacle type film; it is a small and personal film that makes a big impact because of the very, very strong performances it has holding it up.  `The Dresser' is a superb example of the very fact that you don't need to do a whole lot when you do very little very well.  Both Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay deliver knock out performances here, both of them pulling from within to deliver top notch emotionally invested portrayals of men defined and ultimately confined by their loyalties.The film takes place during World War II and tells the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor who owns his own production company and is about to put on his 227th performance as King Lear.  His dresser, Norman, is there every night, nursing him back to sobriety and convincing him that his life's passion is the theater.The film is less about a particular plot and more about the relationship between these two men; the fact that they need one another to make it threw each day.  Sir is helpless without Norman's guiding hand, and Norman has devoted so much of himself to Sir that he doesn't know how to live without him.  Sir is Norman's life, and so he has become much like a parent (or maybe more like an over protective spouse) to Sir because of that.  Even as Sir's habits and bullying (almost self centered) attitude pushes all others away, Norman finds himself drawing closer to Sir as he almost pleads for acceptance and some sort of reciprocated affections.Without the strong performances of both Finney and Courtenay this film would have been a monumental bore; a failure.  Thankfully both Finney and Courtenay deliver boundlessly.Finney is one of my personal favorite actors, for he always knows how to evoke an emotional response from me.  He has such a natural progression to his character's development and so he makes for a very believable and commanding actor.  As Sir, he embodies this man's every weakness without every taking away from the natural compassion we feel for him; thus helping us to understand why a man like Norman is so devoted to him in the first place.  He's like a big, helpless Teddy Bear.  Tom Courtenay has the tougher job of delivering believable paternal affections and he does so marvelously.  What is so phenomenal about Courtenay is that he creates a complete character, from the facial expressions to the hand gestures (I love his hands in this film; almost like a character all their own) to his voice and his very choice of words.  He delivers a brilliant performance that uses every quality of a caricature while reining it in just enough to make it natural and believable.Also, look for Eileen Atkins in a beautifully restrained performance as Madge.I can't say enough how much of a pleasure this film was for me.  It is the perfect example of a `character driven drama' and it serves as a marvelous centerpiece for some breathtaking acting.  If you are a fan of Shakespeare, Albert Finney or dramatic period pieces then this is a MUST-SEE film if ever there was one.",5,Finney and Courtenay excel in this marvelously crafted character study...,1238457600,"03 31, 2009",2009,3027,"['not', 'big', 'spectacle', 'type', 'film', 'small', 'personal', 'film', 'big', 'impact', 'very', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', 'holding', 'up', 'Dresser', 'superb', 'example', 'very', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'when', 'do', 'very', 'little', 'very', 'well', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'deliver', 'knock', 'out', 'performances', 'here', 'pulling', 'deliver', 'top', 'notch', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'portrayals', 'men', 'defined', 'ultimately', 'confined', 'loyalties.The', 'film', 'place', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'story', 'Sir', 'aging', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'who', 'own', 'production', 'company', 'about', 'put', '227th', 'performance', 'King', 'Lear', 'dresser', 'Norman', 'there', 'night', 'nursing', 'back', 'sobriety', 'convincing', 'life', 'passion', 'theater.The', 'film', 'less', 'particular', 'plot', 'more', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'fact', 'need', 'one', 'make', 'threw', 'day', 'Sir', 'helpless', 'Norman', 'guiding', 'hand', 'Norman', 'devoted', 'so', 'much', 'Sir', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'live', 'Sir', 'Norman', 'life', 'so', 'become', 'much', 'parent', 'maybe', 'more', 'protective', 'spouse', 'Sir', 'Even', 'Sir', 'habits', 'bullying', 'almost', 'self', 'centered', 'attitude', 'pushes', 'others', 'away', 'Norman', 'drawing', 'closer', 'Sir', 'almost', 'acceptance', 'sort', 'reciprocated', 'strong', 'performances', 'Finney', 'Courtenay', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'monumental', 'bore', 'failure', 'Thankfully', 'Finney', 'Courtenay', 'deliver', 'boundlessly.Finney', 'one', 'personal', 'favorite', 'actors', 'always', 'how', 'evoke', 'emotional', 'response', 'natural', 'progression', 'character', 'development', 'so', 'very', 'believable', 'commanding', 'actor', 'Sir', 'man', 'weakness', 'taking', 'away', 'natural', 'compassion', 'feel', 'thus', 'helping', 'understand', 'why', 'man', 'Norman', 'so', 'devoted', 'first', 'place', 'big', 'helpless', 'Teddy', 'Bear', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'tougher', 'job', 'delivering', 'believable', 'paternal', 'affections', 'so', 'marvelously', 'What', 'so', 'phenomenal', 'Courtenay', 'complete', 'character', 'facial', 'expressions', 'hand', 'gestures', 'love', 'hands', 'film', 'almost', 'character', 'own', 'voice', 'very', 'choice', 'words', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'quality', 'caricature', 'reining', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'natural', 'believable.Also', 'look', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'beautifully', 'restrained', 'performance', 'Madge.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'much', 'pleasure', 'film', 'was', 'perfect', 'example', 'character', 'driven', 'drama', 'marvelous', 'centerpiece', 'breathtaking', 'acting', 'are', 'fan', 'Shakespeare', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'dramatic', 'period', 'pieces', 'then', 'MUST-SEE', 'film', 'ever', 'was', 'one']",The Dresser VHS

334873,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6302795451,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","[As a train is leaving a station]Sir: Stop that train![The train stops at once]This scene demonstrates the power of acting. Sir (Albert Finney), the head of a Shakespearean acting troupe in Britain, used the authority in his voice that comes from playing King Lear in 227 performances and various other kings and characters an equal number, to stop a train in its tracks. Norman (Tom Courtenay), Sir's dresser, had begged the conductor to wait for just a moment, and was told in no uncertain terms to ""sod off."" The train left the station on schedule. But then the command to stop that train from the regal voice of Sir stopped the train at once.'The Dresser' gives a fascinating look behind the scenes, at the backstage drama--the drama behind the drama. Sir may have a voice that can stop trains, but trying to keep a Shakespeare company on tour during war time Britain is quite a chore. All the young and able bodied actors are away fighting, and it is hard to keep an audience enthralled when you are interrupted by air raid sirens and there is the very real possibility that the theater will be bombed. What is troubling Sir? Is it the critics?------------------Sir: The critics? No, I have nothing but compassion for them. How can I hate the crippled, the mentally deficient, and the dead?===============================Thank you, Sir, for that heart felt vote of confidence. I will try not to disappoint you. In spite of his criticism of critics, Sir is a master thespian, and he knows whereof he speaks:----------------Sir: Keep your teeth in!Geoffrey: It's only when I'm nervousSir: You will be nervous. I guarantee it.===========================Though Norman, a shy and effeminate dresser, is not much use when it comes to stopping trains, Sir relies on him to the utmost. Sir, like King Lear, the character he is portraying, is getting old and loosing his mind. The stage manager and other cast members doubt that he will even be able to perform. There was an incident earlier in the day that showed that Sir was totally insane. He went berserk and was rescued by the dresser, who knew exactly what to say and how to handle him. Backstage, getting ready, he keeps forgetting which play they are doing and Norman has his hands full getting him on track. He even quotes 'Macbeth' which is a very unlucky thing to do according to thespian superstitions, and requires a whole ritual to undo the damage.--------------------Sir: 227 Lears... and I can't remember the first line.===========================Norman remembers them, and he cues Sir, and on with the show. You get the feeling that Norman remembers not just the first lines, but all the lines. He hovers backstage during the performance, cuing Sir from time to time if he gets stuck. Why then isn't Norman an actor?----------------------Norman: My memory is like a policeman. It is never there when you want it.================================Exactly. He is great at feeding Sir his lines from backstage, but put him up there and he would freeze like a deer in the headlights. There is a great scene where Norman must make an announcement, and he reluctantly does it, standing on the corner of the stage with a rag in his pocket, barely able to quell the pre show chatter and get the audience's attention. He blows his line, he is supposed to say ""anyone who wants to leave"" because of the bombing and the air raid but instead says ""anyone who wants to live"" which is the worst sort of mistake you can make under the circumstances.Oblivious to how much he stunk; he later asks the cast members how he did. Great, they all reply very insincerely, which Norman accepts without question, due to an ego protecting suspension of disbelief.Sir also has his fears though, and when they must ask if Oxenby (Edward Fox), one of the actors, will help backstage operating a wind machine for the big storm scene in King Lear, he makes Norman do it. Norman has no trouble in situations like this, drawing power from Sir, even though Sir himself is afraid to do it. Oxenby feels it is beneath his station, and refuses; though later, caught up in the drama, he does help out after all. They all make a supreme effort, and storm up a storm, but does Sir appreciate it?---------------Sir: WHERE... WAS... THE STORM?=====================Ronald Harwood based his play and subsequent screenplay on his experiences as the dresser for the noted Shakespearean actor Donald Wolfit. Harwood has created an excellent script for a brilliant cast. You really get a sense of the human frailty, ambition, desire, vanity, and weakness behind the masks. It is a really different view of the theater, backstage and through the eyes of the person who knows firsthand the reality behind the play, the dresser.Peter Yates also directed 'Breaking Away,' 'Krull,' 'Bullitt,' and 'Mother, Jugs, & Speed;' but I would venture to guess that 'The Dresser' is his best work, as cast and story combined to reveal not only the mortality of man, but also the immortality of great art.SELECTED ROLES OF ALBERT FINNEYBefore the Devil Knows You're Dead(2007) ....

334877,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,6302795451,Ernest Jagger,"[4, 5]","Of all the films that Albert Finney has ever starred in, ""The Dresser"" is his greatest film [in my opinion]. Albert Finney's acting and nuances in the film are unbelievable and totally convincing. This film is highly recommended. The film stars Albert Finney as a traveling Shakespearean actor whose own life is in under tremendous stress. He is beginning to lose grip of the mental faculties in his own life; and while he is undergoing these stresses in his life, and the continual breakdown of his sanity, he is assisted in his theatre performances by his dresser (Tom Courtenay). Courtenay's performance compliments Finney, and the two give a outstanding acting performance.Both of these actor's give their ALL in this wonderful performance, as they try and keep the audiences entertained during the war [WWII]. However, the performances are beginning to become a strain on Finney. With his life already complicated and in dire need of rest, his motto of 'The Show must go on' keeps him entertaining the audiences at the detriment of his own health. With the always faithful companion of his dresser (Courtenay) close by to help assist the old Shakespearean actor on his last legs, the film makes for a very sad and touching film. I don't want to give away anything in the film which will ruin it for you, however, I will write that Finney and Courtenay give a touching and superb story of a freindship whose time has come, and the director, Peter Yates did an admirable job with the film and its characters.

Sure, I could appreciate the splendid acting and dialogue...but the range of human emotions was beyond my range.  I had to mature.  I had to become a caretaker for a loved one.  I had to experience the death of my twin sister who chose to live a life in the theater. I had to become emotionally intimate with another.  Then, and only then, did I get it.  And WOW is this film powerful.On one level, it is a film, possibly the best film about the meaning of theater.  An aging and once great Shakespearean actor is reduced to playing second rate venues in the provinces when all the good actors are off to war against the Nazis. The year is 1940...the fate of the war is uncertain.  Theaters and homes are being bombed.  And yet, ""Sir"" the lead actor continues on playing the major roles of the Shakespeare plays...having never missed giving a performance.He is now exhausted, physically and emotionally.  He is seriously ill..near senilty.  And yet - like the soldiers faced with another dreary, impossible day...he goes on.  But it is all made possible now by his dresser, his confidante, his caretaker, his friend, and most importantly, his intimate.And more than anything else, this is a film about intimacy.  It is quite clear that Norman (brilliantly played by Tom Courtenay) has a homosexual crush on his 'Sir."" But more than that, they really are a pair, feeding and working off each other...Sir is an outstanding actor because his dresser has the skill, reverance, and love to make it happen.  In a sense they perform - together.When ""Sir"" dies at the end, and Norman opens up a cascade of emotions on seeing his friend -quietly dead, his life purpose - coldly dead, this movie gives the most amazing dramatization of grief I have EVER seen on the screen.So...see this when you are 20...40...and 60...and you will experience different parts of the film in different ways.

334879,A2JIU9KUIZ71E2,6302795451,"Gina Marie Warswick ""lover of the arts""","[4, 7]","Albert Finney is the actor character--a consummate Shakespearean actor who has perhaps played the role of King Lear one or two too many times, and is now in the midst of a mental meltdown prior to this latest curtain going up.Tom Courtenay is the actor's dresser--a consummate professional who now faces the tackle of piecing back the shards and fragments of his creation--the actor who must go play Lear.The only thing you need to know are the two main actors: Finney and Courtenay.  Both were nominated against each other in the same category of lead actor in the Oscar race. Both were worthy of winning, and perhaps that is precisely why they both lost.  They are both powerfully over the top in different ways--Finney being out of control and constantly in a state of dramatizing his backstage life like he is in front of an audience, and Courtenay as his rather prissy, fretting, &quot;keep it together&quot; devoted caretaker of his on-screen partner.  The relationship between the two is intensely professional, very confrontational, and very personal.  If those all sound contradictory, yes.  For these actors to pull this off on so many different levels is amazing to watch.  Their vocal battles are superb and highly entertaining.  The only reason I can figure out why they lost their nominations are because the roles were both at the same level of campy, showstopping pompousity.  They equally shared the screen; it is impossible to figure out who is the true singular leading man in this pair.  The film's tightly matched duo makes you ponder the eternal question of who is the true artist--the performer, or the one who prepares the performer to be who he is?See this excellent piece of cinema; it is truly a feast of great acting.  Oh, yeah, director Peter Yates was fabulous in how he didn't bore you with cinema school trickery, and just let the actors steal the show.  Yates also was recognized with a nomination for this picture.  It is sad this film went home empty handed that year at the Oscar ceremony, but it would be even sadder if you didn't give this little gem a chance.

334880,A1TU06ANCFKAJZ,6302795451,GODFREY H.,"[5, 5]","There's a very peculiar review here by one Eric A. Daily, who thinks that the eponymous Dresser is played by John Hurt. Oh no he isn't. It's Tom Courtenay, in one of his most affecting performances. I saw Courtenay play this on the London Stage nearly 30 years ago; unforgettable. By the time I saw the play, Finney had left the cast and ""Sir"" was played superbly by Freddie Jones, a sometimes underrated, undervalued actor who still is working on UK TV, although now in his eighties; we should be so spry. But this film boasts Albert Finney, and in him and Tom Courtenay you have two of the British theatre's -indeed the World's- greatest living actors.As the playwright Ronald Harwood has repeatedly said, the play (and film) are based on his own experiences dressing the great, legendary, barnstorming actor Donald Wolfit, who made relatively few film appearances but whose voice was powerful enough to rattle the front-of-house chandeliers. So this is a loving and poignant elegy to a particular era and a particular style of acting that both have passsed from view. This is neither good nor bad, it's just the way things are; cyclical and ever-renewing, because tastes change and interpretations of the classic texts shift from generation to generation. However... experience tells me that when some of today's British theatrical Knights are booming their way through Shakespeare and Chekhov, the backstage corridors at the National Theatre may yet echo with passions and tensions and the creak of over-stretched egos that would sound very familiar to Sir Donald Wolfit's still-growling spectre.",5,A love-song to Sir Donald Wolfit,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,1600,"['very', 'peculiar', 'review', 'here', 'one', 'Eric', 'A', 'Daily', 'who', 'eponymous', 'Dresser', 'played', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Oh', ""n't"", 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'one', 'most', 'affecting', 'performances', 'saw', 'Courtenay', 'play', 'London', 'Stage', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'unforgettable', 'time', 'saw', 'play', 'Finney', 'had', 'left', 'cast', 'Sir', 'was', 'played', 'superbly', 'Freddie', 'Jones', 'sometimes', 'underrated', 'undervalued', 'actor', 'who', 'still', 'working', 'UK', 'TV', 'now', 'eighties', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'spry', 'film', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'have', 'two', 'British', 'theatre', '-indeed', ""World's-"", 'greatest', 'living', 'actors.As', 'playwright', 'Ronald', 'Harwood', 'repeatedly', 'said', 'play', 'film', 'are', 'based', 'own', 'experiences', 'dressing', 'great', 'legendary', 'barnstorming', 'actor', 'Donald', 'Wolfit', 'who', 'made', 'relatively', 'few', 'film', 'appearances', 'voice', 'was', 'powerful', 'enough', 'rattle', 'front-of-house', 'chandeliers', 'loving', 'poignant', 'elegy', 'particular', 'era', 'particular', 'style', 'acting', 'have', 'passsed', 'view', 'neither', 'good', 'bad', 'just', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'cyclical', 'ever-renewing', 'tastes', 'change', 'interpretations', 'classic', 'texts', 'shift', 'generation', 'generation', 'However', 'experience', 'tells', 'when', 'today', 'British', 'theatrical', 'Knights', 'are', 'booming', 'way', 'Shakespeare', 'Chekhov', 'backstage', 'corridors', 'National', 'Theatre', 'may', 'yet', 'echo', 'passions', 'tensions', 'creak', 'over-stretched', 'egos', 'would', 'sound', 'very', 'familiar', 'Sir', 'Donald', 'Wolfit', 'still-growling', 'spectre']",The Dresser VHS

334882,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,6302795451,Hikari,"[0, 0]","Director Peter Yates assembled a pitch-perfect cast for this look behind the scenes at a touring British theatre troupe in WWII England. Albert Finney is the imperiously named 'Sir', the star-manager of his motley crew of struggling thespians. Since all the able-bodied youth are off fighting Hitler's war, Sir's troops consist of 'old men, cripples and nancy boys'. One is given the impression that the 'Coronet Players' are distinctly third-rate, but top-notch acting goes on backstage between Sir and his fastidiously devoted dresser, Norman (Courtenay, who originated the role in the stage production). Finney chews scenery lustily, by turns bombastic and maudlin, but the show really belongs to Courtenay, who anchors the film as the steady center of Sir's (and the company's) universe. By turns cajoling, buffoonish or castigating as called for, Norman spurs his narcissistic yet pathetically unbalanced boss through his 227th performance of King Lear. The choice of the play-within-a-play is no accident; the events on stage mirror what's going on backstage, with Sir as Lear, the increasingly deranged 'king' and Norman as his faithful Fool, the clown paid to keep the monarch's spirits up, and the only one who is privy to the king's true state of mind. Apart from his ritual Guinness after the show, Sir is not shown to drink alcohol, while Norman is constantly tippling brandy out of a flask in his back pocket, so to attribute Sir's breakdown to alcoholism alone is too glib. ""Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown"", to quote the Bard--Sir has literally cracked under the strain of keeping the many bodies and souls in his care together during the extreme deprivation of war. Yet despite everything, people are so hungry for Art that they sit unfazed through an air bombing. That is why for Sir and Norman, the show has to go on.

Outside it was wickedly cold, snowy, slushy, as I sat at a matinee performance with water slogging in my boots, watching a marvelous production of Ronald Harwood's ""The Dresser"" starring Tom Courtenay as Norman, the theater dresser for Sir, one of the famous actor-managers who toured the British provinces bringing Shakespeare to the hinterlands. Sir was probably modeled on Donald Wolfit who was one of the legendary touring manager-actors.The 1983 motion picture with a screenplay by Harwood, brought together Tom Courtenay as Norman and Albert Finney as Sir. The time was World War II, and German planes were bombing some of the cities where the troupe appeared. Sir is on his last legs, under extreme pressure. He has chosen a difficult group of Shakespearean plays for his small touring acting company to perform including ""King Lear"" which is a difficult and exhausting role for a strong, healthy man to perform. The company is in Bradford, and Sir sees the fire brigades fighting to put out bombing fires. He's exhausted, and it's been a struggle to find a cadre of actors to be in his troupe because of wartime demands.Sir has an attack and has to go to the hospital the night he's supposed to play Lear for the 226th time in his career. He discharges himself from the hospital, but he is in terrible condition. Norman, Sir's dresser, who idolizes his employer, is the only one who can keep him going. He knows every trick to jump start the old man. He knows the lines of the play as well as Sir does.Madge, the stage manager, played by Eileen Atkins, who also adores her employer, thinks Sir is too ill to go on, but Norman insists he can be ready and gets him up for the part by his powers of persuasion. Norman fights off the other cast members and bullies them into letting him get the old man ready. It's touch and go whether Sir can go on or not.The movie does a beautiful job of portraying an England at war, and showing how a theater production looks from backstage. The scenes in which Finney as Sir is applying his make-up with Courtenay's Norman prodding him are masterful. The fuss budget Norman has only his nips of brandy to keep him going.

The film is above all a vehicle for some noteworthy acting by two veteran British actors (on stage and in film) Tom Courtney, as the effeminate manservant Norman, and Albert Finney, Norman's master (an aged Shakespearean actor), who goes by the odd name Sir.  The supporting cast is also up to the task-despite remaining in the background- since they shine in their infrequent scenes.  The Dresser, adapted from a well-known Broadway play, still has the feel of theater and doesn't fully embrace the cinematic medium.  One gets the frustrating sense that the film version doesn't add anything to the original theater version (albeit, I haven't seen the Broadway production).Brief Plot summary (limited spoilers)The year is 1940 and Britain is devastated by the Blitz.  Sir (Finney), an increasingly senile Shakespearean actor, is the head of a rag tag theater troupe touring Britain's provinces of elderly and occasionally resentful actors, a distant and increasingly heavy (and thus hard for Sir to carry) wife, and a besotted stage manager (Eileen Atkins).  Sir is attended to in all aspects of his daily life and preparation for his roles by Norman, an effeminate manservant who gives everything to keep Sir on the stage (for example, reminding him hour to hour the name of the play to be performed, the first lines, reminding him how to put on his makeup, washing him, etc etc).  The film spans the production of King Lear, played by Sir.  Norman pulls out all the strings to prepare Sir and his own feelings (and resentment) come to fore.  It is the dialogue and interaction behind the scenes of the production between Sir and Norman which constitutes most of the film.My ThoughtsThe Dresser is entirely a character driven film.  Peter Yates' visuals are minimal and uninvolved on purpose.  Occasionally, we glimpse scenes from the production of King Lear but these sets are worn and faded reflecting the dire situation of the troupe and war torn England.  This stark, dreary, subdued feel (especially with the panic inducing air raid siren) throughout reminds the audience of the historical backdrop.Both male leads are well fleshed out characters.  Norman, a immensely caring and loyal servant, yearns for the slightest recognition of his efforts from other members of the troupe but above all, from Sir.  Sir himself, who in his senile state (and most likely before) perhaps thinks too highly of his own abilities (he attempts to pen his autobiography at various points in the narrative), maintains an external charisma despite his inner turmoils and confusion.  His dual persona -- the one he shows on stage and to the various other members of the troupe who don't fully realize how senile he's become and the one we see through his interactions with Norman -- is immediately and disturbingly apparent.My only qualm in regards to the two characters is the occasional overacting.  This makes sense in regards to Sir who carries his Shakespearean mannerisms and voice into his daily life -- however, even this tends to get somewhat grating and forced.  The character of Norman is also often overacted which has the unfortunate result of reducing his character into the realm of clich&eacute; and type (the homosexual British man).  These are somewhat minor qualms and shouldn't detract too much from these two wonderful portrayals.This is a dark film.  No scene is superfluous (besides occasionally, the acting).  I've always been interested in films about movies and films about theater so The Dresser was a must see.  I'm not sure that this is a classic -- a sentiment reinforced by my sneeking suspicion that unless I write this review I would soon forget the images and characters.  If one likes good, solid, dark British dramas this is a great choice which deserves at least a little resurgence of the recognition and praise it initially received.",4,A Delightful Character Driven Film directed by Peter Yates,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,4357,"['Nominated', '5', 'Academy', 'awards', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Leading', 'Role', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Leading', 'Role', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Best', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Yates', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Peter', 'Yates', 'Best', 'Writing', 'Screenplay', 'Based', 'Material', 'Medium', 'Ronald', 'Harwood', 'immensely', 'popular', 'initial', 'release', 'Peter', 'Yates', 'solid', 'well-acted', 'somewhat', 'forgettable', 'drama', 'Dresser', '1983', 'fallen', 'wayside', 'garnering', 'five', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'numerous', 'BAFTA', 'nominations', 'film', 'vehicle', 'noteworthy', 'acting', 'two', 'veteran', 'British', 'actors', 'stage', 'film', 'Tom', 'Courtney', 'effeminate', 'manservant', 'Norman', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Norman', 'master', 'aged', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'who', 'odd', 'name', 'Sir', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'up', 'task-despite', 'remaining', 'background-', 'shine', 'infrequent', 'scenes', 'Dresser', 'adapted', 'well-known', 'Broadway', 'play', 'still', 'feel', 'theater', ""n't"", 'fully', 'embrace', 'cinematic', 'medium', 'One', 'frustrating', 'sense', 'film', 'version', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'original', 'theater', 'version', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Broadway', 'production', '.Brief', 'Plot', 'summary', 'limited', 'spoilers', 'year', '1940', 'Britain', 'devastated', 'Blitz', 'Sir', 'Finney', 'increasingly', 'senile', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'head', 'rag', 'tag', 'theater', 'troupe', 'touring', 'Britain', 'provinces', 'elderly', 'occasionally', 'resentful', 'actors', 'distant', 'increasingly', 'heavy', 'thus', 'hard', 'Sir', 'carry', 'wife', 'besotted', 'stage', 'manager', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Sir', 'attended', 'aspects', 'daily', 'life', 'preparation', 'roles', 'Norman', 'effeminate', 'manservant', 'who', 'everything', 'keep', 'Sir', 'stage', 'example', 'reminding', 'hour', 'hour', 'name', 'play', 'be', 'performed', 'first', 'lines', 'reminding', 'how', 'put', 'makeup', 'washing', 'etc', 'etc', 'film', 'production', 'King', 'Lear', 'played', 'Sir', 'Norman', 'out', 'strings', 'prepare', 'Sir', 'own', 'feelings', 'resentment', 'come', 'fore', 'dialogue', 'interaction', 'scenes', 'production', 'Sir', 'Norman', 'most', 'film.My', 'ThoughtsThe', 'Dresser', 'entirely', 'character', 'driven', 'film', 'Peter', 'Yates', 'visuals', 'are', 'minimal', 'uninvolved', 'purpose', 'Occasionally', 'glimpse', 'scenes', 'production', 'King', 'Lear', 'sets', 'are', 'worn', 'faded', 'reflecting', 'dire', 'situation', 'troupe', 'war', 'torn', 'England', 'stark', 'dreary', 'subdued', 'feel', 'especially', 'panic', 'inducing', 'air', 'raid', 'siren', 'audience', 'historical', 'male', 'leads', 'are', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'characters', 'Norman', 'immensely', 'caring', 'loyal', 'servant', 'yearns', 'slightest', 'recognition', 'efforts', 'other', 'members', 'troupe', 'Sir', 'Sir', 'who', 'senile', 'state', 'most', 'likely', 'perhaps', 'too', 'highly', 'own', 'abilities', 'pen', 'autobiography', 'various', 'points', 'narrative', 'external', 'charisma', 'inner', 'turmoils', 'confusion', 'dual', 'persona', 'one', 'stage', 'various', 'other', 'members', 'troupe', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'fully', 'realize', 'how', 'senile', 'become', 'one', 'see', 'interactions', 'Norman', 'immediately', 'disturbingly', 'only', 'qualm', 'regards', 'two', 'characters', 'occasional', 'overacting', 'sense', 'regards', 'Sir', 'who', 'Shakespearean', 'mannerisms', 'voice', 'daily', 'life', 'however', 'even', 'get', 'somewhat', 'grating', 'forced', 'character', 'Norman', 'also', 'often', 'overacted', 'unfortunate', 'result', 'reducing', 'character', 'realm', 'clich', 'eacute', 'type', 'homosexual', 'British', 'man', 'are', 'somewhat', 'minor', 'qualms', 'should', ""n't"", 'detract', 'too', 'much', 'two', 'wonderful', 'portrayals.This', 'dark', 'film', 'scene', 'superfluous', 'occasionally', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'films', 'movies', 'films', 'theater', 'Dresser', 'was', 'must', 'see', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'classic', 'sentiment', 'reinforced', 'sneeking', 'suspicion', 'write', 'review', 'would', 'soon', 'forget', 'images', 'characters', 'one', 'good', 'solid', 'dark', 'British', 'dramas', 'great', 'choice', 'least', 'little', 'resurgence', 'recognition', 'praise', 'initially', 'received']",The Dresser VHS
