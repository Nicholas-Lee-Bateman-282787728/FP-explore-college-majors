The bath house (onsen) episode (episode 10) is terribly cute and funny, though, and Saiyuki Reload does cover the Kami-sama arc (episodes 17 through 25), which is very serious and pretty pivotal to the series.The Urasai (behind-the-scenes clips) are funny too, and they come at the end of each episode.If you like the Saiyuki series, you should at least grab the Kami-sama epsiodes from Saiyuki Reload (episodes 17 through 25, discs 5 through 7).",4,"Some Fluff, but Good Animation and Kami-sama Arc",1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,796,"['art', 'style', 'animation', 'quality', 'smoothness', 'action', 'etc', 'are', 'definitely', 'better', 'Saiyuki', 'Reload', 'were', 'Saiyuki.The', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'same', 'Saiyuki', 'Saiyuki', 'Reload', ""'re"", 'awesome', 'both.Unfortunately', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'most', 'episodes', 'Saiyuki', 'Reload', 'are', 'fluffy', 'filler', 'episodes', 'bath', 'house', 'onsen', 'episode', 'episode', '10', 'terribly', 'cute', 'funny', 'though', 'Saiyuki', 'Reload', 'cover', 'Kami-sama', 'arc', '17', '25', 'very', 'serious', 'pretty', 'pivotal', 'series.The', 'Urasai', 'behind-the-scenes', 'clips', 'are', 'funny', 'too', 'come', 'end', 'episode.If', 'Saiyuki', 'series', 'should', 'least', 'grab', 'Kami-sama', 'epsiodes', 'Saiyuki', 'Reload', '17', '25', 'discs', '5', '7']",Saiyuki Reload - Complete
1004019,AFV2584U13XP3,B000GGSMFI,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[2, 2]","After buying the first and second season of this entertaining series I was greatly overjoyed to see that they released the third season box set, and while as many have said yes the dubbed voice cast are different the series still I feel will entertain many of the fans of the show.  I do advise people to watch the first two seasons of the show though before buying this one as you'll need to know the background and history of the characters, the quest they've undertaken, and the enemies that wish to stop them at all cost along their journeys.  The animation to me looks the same as the first two seasons except for one detail in that is instead of still shots during the battle scenes(Meaning a picture of a character throwing his fist or using his weapon and the sound effect of a hit or strike but no actual movement) a lot of them do have animation motion this time.  As some reviewers have said the Japanese voice cast are still the same in great in their character roles but the dubbed English cast is different since this time Geneon dubbed actors have done the roles instead of the ADV film actors and while it takes a while to get used to the voice cast aren't really that bad if you give them a chance,  There are definitely a lot worse voice actors at there to be sure.  The set is seven dvds put into individual case in put into a cardboard sleeve that's pretty sturdy so all in all until Funimation releases the set again I just say buy from one of the sellers on the Amazon site I got this for a steal and have no regret for that choice...",5,Regardless Of Being A Filler Season Or Not Still A Great Season To Try Out,1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,1556,"['buying', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'entertaining', 'series', 'was', 'greatly', 'overjoyed', 'see', 'released', 'third', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'as', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'yes', 'dubbed', 'voice', 'cast', 'are', 'different', 'series', 'still', 'feel', 'will', 'entertain', 'many', 'fans', 'show', 'do', 'advise', 'people', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'buying', 'one', ""'ll"", 'need', 'know', 'background', 'history', 'characters', 'quest', ""'ve"", 'undertaken', 'enemies', 'wish', 'stop', 'cost', 'journeys', 'animation', 'same', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'one', 'detail', 'instead', 'still', 'shots', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Meaning', 'picture', 'character', 'throwing', 'fist', 'using', 'weapon', 'sound', 'effect', 'hit', 'strike', 'actual', 'movement', 'lot', 'do', 'have', 'animation', 'motion', 'time', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'cast', 'are', 'still', 'same', 'great', 'character', 'roles', 'dubbed', 'English', 'cast', 'different', 'time', 'Geneon', 'dubbed', 'actors', 'have', 'done', 'roles', 'instead', 'ADV', 'film', 'actors', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'voice', 'cast', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'give', 'chance', 'are', 'definitely', 'lot', 'worse', 'voice', 'actors', 'be', 'sure', 'set', 'seven', 'dvds', 'put', 'individual', 'case', 'put', 'cardboard', 'sleeve', 'pretty', 'sturdy', 'so', 'all', 'Funimation', 'set', 'again', 'just', 'say', 'buy', 'one', 'sellers', 'Amazon', 'site', 'got', 'steal', 'have', 'regret', 'choice']",Saiyuki Reload - Complete

The only problem I have with this show is the English dub!  The voice actors don't give the characters the same feelings!  I am super disappointed in all of the character voice except the annoying monkey-child.  Always fun to call him the annoying monkey-child.The plots are original and just as involving as the original series.  The characters act the way you'd expect them to, and everybody's favorite priest still kicks ass.
