Aunt Bam was really good and the story about how a family can be so divided on past unresolved issues and then wonder why their current lives are so far apart from one another was portrayed brilliantly. Nice little twists as well. The dramatic points could easily have been stand alone pieces but were succinctly understated. We really enjoyed this film and watched it a second time a few days later.

Robinson ""Electrojunkie""","[9, 13]","It seems that every year Tyler Perry has a new film that comes out and with this one, he should have slowed down and took his time because this has seemed rush. This movie doesn't have the magic like some of his earlier works like Diary of a Mad Black Woman & The Family That Prays.This movie has all of Tyler's other films all wrapped up into this one and basically sloppily done. Lets see Bow Wow selling drugs is similar to Keshia Knight Pulliam being a prostitute in Madea Goes to Jail, the sister rivalry is just like Taraji P. Henson & Sanaa Lathan in The Family That Prays, the marriage problems is just like Why Did I Get Married films, baby mama drama is almost like Diary of a Mad Black Woman, kids with a smart mouth is like I Can Do Bad All By Myself. Throw in Brown from Meet the Browns, and Madea from all the other films she starred in and you got Madea's Big Happy Family.Instead of hiring all these new actors to play Madea's family it would have been better if Tyler had elaborated on Madea's part of the family that we seen in earlier films. Like how Kimberly Elise and Shemar Moore's characters are doing, the characters from Madea's Family Reunion film, none of them have been mentioned at all in films that starred Madea. I'm far more interested in those characters than the characters that were in this film because they are just recycled characters from Tyler's earlier films. What about the child that Madea was a foster mother to that was played by Keke Palmer, I mean what is going on with them.Instead cliched characters, snooty sister, men being owned by their wives, ghetto baby mama, a pot head, and Brown being unfunny as usual. Using Maury as a comedy is a big no. Maury's show sucks with the 1000% sure and running off stage, that's not funny, that's just tasteless.Tyler should slow down and put more thoughts, character development, and great storytelling instead of having a family tragedy that brings everyone together in the end.

Tyler Perry, 2011, 107 minutes) proves one thing among several: if there is a William Shakespeare of the late 20th and early 21st century, it is Tyler Perry. Perry again appears as the frightening, monolithic Southern matriarch Madea Simmons, this time saddled with a tragedy that she naturally is too rambunctious to take lying down.When Madea's niece Shirley (the DIVINE Loretta Devine) is diagnosed, again, with serious cancer and given only weeks to live, she desires to assemble her children to tell them. When one is confronted by a Tyler Perry film, one knows to expect grating, emotional, drop-dead hilarious highjinks and this film delivers like no other I have seen. While I am sadly confined to only bits of Perry's genius -Tyler Perry's Meet The Browns,Madea Goes to Jail (The Tyler Perry Collection)- and don't know the entire story, I can recommend this as the funniest, saddest and most cogent film of Perry's.This all began withMadea's Family Reunion (Full Screen Edition)nearly 10 years ago (to my shame, I do not know anything about the Madea plays Perry has done or if they are available on DVD). Just concentrate on the films. They are insane, too funny to begin to be described and the one-liners are among the best comedy ever written.With the talents of the GORGEOUS and charming Bow Wow, a vital cameo by Maury Povich as himself, Cassi Davis, Shannon Kane, Isaiah Mustafa, Natalie Desselle Reid, Rodney Perry, the fantastic Tamela J. Mann as Cora Madea's daughter, David Mann ... and a whole bunch of hilarious folks I am too lazy and good-for-nothing to list here.If you have never seen or even heard of Madea (HOW can that be?!) see this film.

She's thanking God for the days she's had and accepting what is to come. All she wants more than anything is to sit down at a nice dinner with her adult children so they will all be together when she tells them the sad news.Madea's Big Happy Family sends much needed messages to husbands and wives, battling siblings, bad behind children, teenage single parents... any family dealing with sensitive issues, disrespecting each other and keeping secrets. There were `zany' parts in this movie - I can deal with zany for a little bit, but it gets on my nerves after a while - but there were also quite a few touching and eye-opening moments. The first time I saw this movie was in the theater. The Opening Credits shows like an animated mini-movie, so I was entertained even before the movie began. My main thought after the movie was that families really need to stop wasting time and taking each other for granted. A sequel would be nice, because I would like to know what happens with Kimberly's (Shannon Kane) situation.Favorite Character: Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis) - she's honest, bold and witty.Favorite Line: You don't feel bad for me. You feel bad for somebody who don't know Jesus.Favorite Scenes: Something's Got to Give/Look in the MirrorI appreciate the fact that Mr. Perry brings humor into people's lives. I've always seen the ability to make others laugh as one of the most precious gifts a person could have. This world needs more happiness; I know I could use a good laugh daily. Mr. Perry has created a character or two who can be a little over the top - zany - but as a whole I enjoy his work. Laughter is only one thing his films bring to my life. What I like most is the lessons he teaches with his movies. When she's not acting crazy and going off on people, Madea shares words of wisdom that can reach my heart like a good Bible teaching. (Don't ask her about The Bible, though, because she is not very good at interpreting Scripture). And even when Madea doesn't play a part in a movie, somebody is going to say something thought-provoking. I don't have many of Mr. Perry's plays on DVD, but I do own every movie.

I would have liked to see a couple of flashbacks of Byron and Sabrina, to show how they hooked up in the first place. This movie would have greatly benefited from more backstory. And the thing between Cora and her father in this film was unneeded and didn't really add to the story. One of the good things to be taken from this story is that you should raise your child right.

I thought I was in the clear unless someone named Byron was around. Apparently there doesn't even have to be a Byron around for somebody to feel the need to be annoying enough to mock that incredibly loud, ghetto, annoying ""baby momma"" in the film.Cons: I know Tyler Perry gets a lot of criticism for how men are portrayed in many of his other movies so I think he tried to make up for it in this one. I get why he would want to show the father who is trying to be a positive, responsible person for his kids, and the husbands who are trying to make their marriages work. However, every single woman in the entire script was incredibly negative: greedy mother; gold-digging girlfriend; nosey weed-smoking roommate; prudish hostile wife; loud-talking unappreciative wife; a mother who appears to be nice but we find out a secret about her (I won't spoil it, but if you've seen Tyler Perry's other movies it's not difficult to guess what it is); and Madea is driving through restaurants hopping the counters. I like Madea. I think she's amusing. But the rest of these women (minus Cora, who didn't have anything different about her plot in this story as she had in others--still thinking Mr. Brown is her father and being ""surprised"" when she finds out he's not) were repulsive. I can't quite tell whether Tyler Perry was trying to send a message to sistas saying, ""Too many of you all act like this"" or is he really just angry with the state of women in his own life. The downside is that the characters aren't so far-fetched that I can't think of someone I know now who could play each of these roles. It was draining to see that nobody seemed to have much going for themselves outside of the men. And speaking of men, I can't think of ONE guy who would take this much abuse from these women. There was way too much ""knights in distress"" going on. This movie made the guys in the ""Twilight"" films seem strong and independent, and those guys were super sprung. And as for any guy whose name is Byron, I feel so bad for you. There's going to be that one woman in your life who's going to think it's funny to constantly mock that name. I wanted to reach through the screen and punch the trouble-making mother in the mouth. Gawd, she was so annoying. But again, I know women like her...just like her, so that was even more creepy.The plot was about the same as any other plot. We have a drug dealer, someone who is molested, marriages that aren't working, and even threw in a couple particularly trashy Maury Povich episodes arguing about who is the father of some children. This is in addition to another ""surprise"" kid. The stereotypes were in full effect in this film. Even the head mother was annoying. She just kept letting her kids run over her, and it seemed like Madea was the only one who had some kind of power to make people sit down and shut up. The rest of the women had enough strength to be brutal to the guys and kinda disrespectful to the head mother, but nobody really seemed to care.Pros: Bow Wow's performance in the film was REALLY good. I've enjoyed him in ""Roll Bounce,"" ""Lottery Ticket"" and a couple other flicks, but he did such an impressive job in this film. The only problem is that the film was so awful that I think his performance will be overlooked.I'm not a fan of Spike Lee. Period. I think he's incredibly rude and mean-spirited (met him in person), so it pains me to say I absolutely agree with him about Tyler Perry films. This is by far the worst movie he's done, and I have been a Tyler Perry supporter for years. But it's time to write about something else.

Things do not go as planned, and many hurts come out.  However in the midst of the dysfunction and sadness, the family does come together in the crisis and attempts to face some of their problems and sadness.Critics complain the humor is too present and lowbrow -- however I find, like in Shakespeare's tragedies, the use of humor takes some of the sting away from the horror and brings a balance to the production, without diminishing the quality of either.

If it was one of his earlier movies it would be easier to justify how badly edited and low budget it looks. Some of the scenes go on longer than than they need to. And it has a spoofish quality to it which lacks the balance of his other movies. Maybe he was trying to give a comedic ""Brady Bunch"" twist to the usual stories about black families. But it doesn't come off well. A lot of things are thrown in there without any rationale (like Madea going crazy and driving her car through the window of a burger joint just because the server wouldn't serve her properly).The themes explored are quite depressing- like the (largely passive) mother suffering from cancer and the vitriolic sisters always at each other's and their husband's throats. There is no real resolution in the end, except Madea giving a big speech to all the family members. The advise given is quite obvious and lacks the wisdom and insight that her character displays in other movies. Some of the characters are uneccesary and just seem to be a parody of themselves in trying to address black stereotypes. I can understand why Spike Lee and others might criticize it. There doesn't seem to be much of a moral here except ""family stick together even if you are dysfunctional"" and ""men stand up to your women"". It seems like an attempt to explore the men's side of the story in relationships. But it doesn't do so convincingly. The stand out performances for me were Lil Bow wow and Teyana Taylor. Lil bow wow was execellent and believable as the frustrated young father. If I didn't know he was a rapper, I could easily believe he was an actor. Teyana Taylor stole the show as the baby mama from hell.
