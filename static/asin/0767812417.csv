11514,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,0767812417,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[0, 0]","""Oliver"" is a remarkable achievement for a musical.  Each scene expertly envelops the listener and viewer into a feast of a visual and audio masterpiece.  For those who hate musicals or are at least less partial, the Dicken's story will quell some of the sentimentality associated with this genre.  The rough atmosphere helps with some of the songs and invites those who would have a cursory interest to join in for the fun.  The characters are engaging enough to begin with, but the performances are superb.  Ron Moody's Fagin is masterful, especially that he can take a hardened character and make him seem likable.  An emotional connection is easily made with every character:  We like Dodger (Jack Wild), love Nancy, root for Oliver (Mark Lester), and sneer at Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed), a nuanced and menacing enemy.The technical achievements are also hallmark.  It is no small thing that the camera angles are expertly framed for the wide view as well as for the intimate, closer shots. (Take a look at the first ""Annie"" movie and see if you don't agree.)  The editing, too, is great, making the scenes unfold with grandeur and a timing that is as close to perfect as a musical movie gets.  The songs are great, also, even if they sometimes linger too long, especially  ""As Long as He Needs Me,"" but at least it gives the audience a moment to pause and catch its collective breath.  Some are sing-alongs, like one would expect at a lively pub, including ""Oom Pah Pah,"" ""Consider Yourself"" and ""It's a Fine Life"".  Then, there are songs with the grandeur of ""Who Will Buy?"" Variety is enhanced with other songs, like ""Boy for Sale,"" which seems rooted in opera.This movie makes one believe it could be made today; it is so timeless.  Yet, it draws so much from the old musicals and innovates with new elements, that it could only have been made in this place and time (England, 1968).  It is hard to find anything (except maybe ""The Sound of Music"" or ""An American in Paris"") that matches the quality of this film.  It is heart-warming, suspenseful, and engaging throughout.",5,"Something Old, Something New",1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,2078,"['Oliver', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'musical', 'scene', 'expertly', 'listener', 'viewer', 'feast', 'visual', 'audio', 'masterpiece', 'who', 'hate', 'musicals', 'are', 'least', 'less', 'partial', 'Dicken', 'story', 'will', 'quell', 'sentimentality', 'associated', 'genre', 'rough', 'atmosphere', 'songs', 'invites', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'cursory', 'interest', 'join', 'fun', 'characters', 'are', 'engaging', 'enough', 'begin', 'performances', 'are', 'superb', 'Ron', 'Moody', 'Fagin', 'masterful', 'especially', 'can', 'take', 'hardened', 'character', 'make', 'seem', 'likable', 'emotional', 'connection', 'easily', 'made', 'character', 'Dodger', 'Jack', 'Wild', 'love', 'Nancy', 'root', 'Oliver', 'Mark', 'Lester', 'sneer', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'nuanced', 'menacing', 'enemy.The', 'technical', 'achievements', 'are', 'also', 'hallmark', 'small', 'thing', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'expertly', 'framed', 'wide', 'view', 'as', 'well', 'intimate', 'closer', 'shots', 'Take', 'look', 'first', 'Annie', 'movie', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'editing', 'too', 'great', 'making', 'scenes', 'unfold', 'grandeur', 'timing', 'as', 'close', 'perfect', 'musical', 'movie', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'also', 'even', 'sometimes', 'linger', 'too', 'long', 'especially', 'As', 'Long', 'Me', 'least', 'audience', 'moment', 'pause', 'catch', 'collective', 'breath', 'are', 'sing-alongs', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'lively', 'pub', 'including', 'Oom', 'Pah', 'Pah', 'Consider', 'Fine', 'Life', 'Then', 'are', 'songs', 'grandeur', 'Who', 'Will', 'Buy', 'Variety', 'enhanced', 'other', 'songs', 'Boy', 'Sale', 'rooted', 'opera.This', 'movie', 'one', 'believe', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'today', 'so', 'timeless', 'so', 'much', 'old', 'musicals', 'innovates', 'new', 'elements', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'place', 'time', 'England', '1968', 'hard', 'find', 'anything', 'maybe', 'Sound', 'Music', 'American', 'Paris', 'quality', 'film', 'heart-warming', 'suspenseful', 'engaging']",N/A

11523,A3FVAWZNKW9GX,0767812417,"A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com ""What should ...","[4, 6]","""Oliver!"" is the first musical I ever came to love, to learn the words to, and to want to see again. When people think of this wonderful adaptation of Charles Dickens' dark and occasionally hopeful ""Oliver Twist,"" the music might come first to mind. Why wouldn't it? The songs are remarkable, and worth ever acclaim. Take away the music (and I hope you never would), and there is left a strong story with a strong message played by strong actors, all well-produced.The younger viewers will see the trials and tribulations of Oliver Twist. Older viewers will connect with Nancy or Bill Sikes, or look deep into the tyranny of poverty and those who would profit from the vulnerable poor.Ron Moody is the star as Fagin, but a not often talked about enough performance of Jack Wild's Artful Dodger. He has an insightfulness and an almost innocent prying likeability that infects audiences. He's a thief, working for the top thief, and trying to involve young and lonely Oliver, but only so to protect him and befriend him.Peggy Mount is endearing as Mrs. Bumble, with a personality not unlike Mrs. Butterworth of pancake syrup fame.The tone is ironically whimsical, demonstrating a contrast in the tenor of the rich and poor, of those singing and those in need.The settings are impressively realistic, keeping in mind the time this was produced. Not as big budget as epics like ""The Ten Commandments,"" it still can carry the audience into believing they were really there. We see the humanity behind the poor culture of London. We see the tragedies of lives that could have been beautiful, and grimace with the fates of some.Even though the music is fun and memorable, so is the not as happy message. Across England, homeless children were being abused and put into near-slavery in a black-market pickpocket scheme. Dickens took what he saw around him and developed one of the English's most compelling literary social statements.I fully recommend ""Oliver!""

11525,A278F98P04C6TM,0767812417,B. Adler,"[10, 14]","This movie is one of my all-time favorites even though I'm embarrassed to say so. Primarily because I'm Jewish and Dickens' original tale of Oliver Twist is one of few in classic literature that firstly portrays Jews at all, and worse, with such anti-semitism. Written in 1837, anti-semitism was ingrained into English society and manifests itself in Dickens' depiction of ""Fagin the Jew"" which is littered within the original works. There is some debate, however, if Dickens himself was actually a racist. Although it would appear so obvious, the ""conventional wisdom"" of the time, the money-grubbing Jew, was permeated within the culture. It's not an excuse, but not surprising for people who succumb to such racism, not meeting or interacting with Jews socially. To his credit, he went on to write ""Our Mutual Friend"" and created the positive Jewish character of Riah. And in 1867, he re-edited Oliver Twist in an attempt to remove the racist references of  ""Fagin the Jew"".  I've read portions of the novel and just found it too disturbing to read it all.Having said all that, this is still one of my favorite movies. Mostly because Fagin's character is barely associated with anything that would be considered stereotypical. Ron Moody sings and dances with a certain Jewish ethinicity, but for all his wickedness, he comes across just as equally lovable. The real story is poor Oliver, destined to live as a poor child on the streets who ends up miraculously finding his rather wealthy family and home. Besides, the real villian is focused on Bill Sikes, brilliantly portrayed by Oliver Reed, who is as menacing as he is heartless. You laugh, you cry, you cheer. It's a good time.The music became classics of their own accord. We were taught these songs in choir as a child, as well as hearing them on the radio. ""Where is Love"", ""OomPahPah"" to which we played a hand clapping game, ""Food Glorious Food"" and ""Consider Yourself"" are just a few of the more popular.

I love movies, and I have always loved movies, but never before in my life have I got so much enjoyment out of watching one movie in my life, until I saw OLIVER! This is a musicalization of the Charles Dickens classic 'Oliver Twist' about a young boy who flees his drab life of workhouse servitude and falls in with a band of pickpockets led by the incorrigible Fagin(Ron Moody, Oscar-nominated). Mark Lester is absolutely magnificent in the title role. Jack Wild is equally winning as his slick sidekick, The Artful Dodger. In fact, Lester and Wild worked together so well in this film that they were reunited for the popular 1971 British release, MELODY. Oliver Reed is appropriately menacing as the brutish Bill Sykes, and Shani Wallis is lovely as his girlfriend, Nancy. The film was directed by Oliver Reed's uncle, Sir Carol Reed. Some might believe that this film pales in comparison to David Lean's more straightforward 1948 filmization. But there is little room for debate that Carol Reed's version is the more entertaining of the duo. OLIVER! is the last of the truly great movie musicals. It's easy to watch over and over again, and it's the type of film that looks better with every viewing.

When his mates choose him to request ""more"" of the thin gruel that forms their diet, his boldness gets him sold to an undertaker for three guineas.  He escapes, walks seven days to London to ""seek his fortune,"" and meets up with the Artful Dodger (Jack Wild), a cheeky, street-smart urchin who offers to provide him with lodgings.  Oliver is so innocent that he has no idea he's fallen in with a band of pickpockets--until the next day when he sees the Dodger and another boy make off with a gentleman's wallet, and is so stunned that he's mistakenly arrested for the crime himself.  But the owner of the wallet becomes his partisan and takes him into his home--from which the underworld resolves to extract him for fear he may blab.Though Oliver himself is nominally the hero and focus of the story, the movie's best parts (literally) are those of adults: Mr. Brownlow (Joseph O'Conor), the handsome, dignified middle-aged gentleman who turns out to be the boy's great-uncle; Nancy (Shani Wallis), the brassy music-hall singer whose one great, fatal weakness is her love for housebreaker Bill Sikes; Sikes (Oliver Reed) himself, sinister and soft-spoken; and Fagin (Ron Moody), who despite his felonies has about him a certain charm--he seems genuinely fond of his boys and is strongly opposed to violence.  Most of the songs from the stage version have been retained, although as a matter of necessity several of Dickens's important characters and two or three of his subplots have been dispensed with.  The dancing is exuberant and all the cast well-chosen.

11538,AUHG8KSHI529U,0767812417,Craig Matteson,"[9, 10]","Dickens' story of Oliver Twist has always been popular and heart wrenching.  Well, unless you are just too too sophisticated for such things.  I find that being ""above"" such works just too deadly dull.  A small boy simply trying to survive in the world that is not only indifferent to him, but actively hostile to his trying to live, is  something people identify with and want to do something about.  And it was the desire to prick the conscience of the public to inspire action to care for the poor and orphans that Dickens was after.  David Lean made a fine film of the novel in 1948.  This musical was made twenty years later and won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1968.  There were many nominations including Ron Moody's wonderful portrayal of Fagin.  His is a very different Fagin from the character in the novel, but one that is always a delight on the screen and is indelible in the memory.And what Moody did for Fagin is pretty much what happens to the whole story.  Everything is cheered up quite a bit (for the most part) and cleaned up for a musical that sends everyone home singing some pleasant tunes.  The story follows the broad outlines of the novel.  Nancy (Shani Wallis) is freshened up and made more beautiful than such a creature could ever have been, but she still pays the price for protecting Oliver from Bill Sykes.  Oliver Reed's Bill Sikes is amazingly threatening and burns in the memory of children who see the movie, even today.The musical does have a sharp split in mood.  The first half of the movie, all the way to the song ""Who Will Buy"" is pretty much treated as a journey, but one of improving fortune for Oliver and culminates in that song.  The mood is jolly and full of tunes one can't help but remember.  You find yourself singing them for days afterwards even when you don't want to.  They are that infectious.  However, after that song, once Sikes decides he needs to get the boy back to protect himself, no matter what.  The story and the film change a great deal.  It is almost like falling off a cliff.The musical finds a happy ending for all except the one great villain and his beautiful victim.  However, the jolly mood of the first half returns with some more happy tunes and we leave the theater with the horror of Sikes and Nancy sort of tucked away behind our good mood.  As I watched this musical again, I was amazed how well things still hold up.  There is one song, though, that as an adult I found a bit unnerving.  When Nancy sings ""As Long As He Needs Me"", I thought about how too typical this self destructive attitude is and wish such an awful sentiment didn't get such a beautiful song.  She isn't staying by a cancer patient, you know.  She is pledging to a monster.  Still, it is a beautiful song.  I just hope it is more often sung in the context of a more noble situation.Oh, and for you younger viewers.  All those huge crowd scenes are actually full of people.  I know that today all those little folks in the back would all by CGI.  However, those did not exist in 1968.  Those are all people dancing way in the back.  Yeah, even the dots way way in the back are actual people dancing.  This musical was already a bit dated when it was done as far as style and being happy and cheerful without irony.  Such a movie was, I believe, never made again.  So, it is great that we have this multiple Oscar winning film to remember a time before everyone felt the need of being miserable as a fashion statement.  Strongly recommended for all audiences, except the too ironically detached.",5,"The last of the cast of thousands musicals.

I watched three in all: this one, the David Lean version, and the Roman Polanski version.  While the Roman Polanski version was truest to the novel, none of the three followed the novel very closely.  And while all three had different qualities (and all three are well worth seeing for different reasons), only OLIVER! kept me glued on account of its magical feel and Dickensian nostalgia.Sure, it had top notch acting and incredible cinematography; but these compliments were well earned by the other two aforementioned adaptations.  But since it was a musical, OLIVER! also had songs that seemed to bring forth memories that I didn't know I had.  I had never seen the movie before.  And I had never heard any of the songs in their entirety as best as I can remember.  But there was a strong familiarity in several of them: ""Food, Glorious Food"", ""I'd Do Anything"", ""Who Will Buy?"", and ""Consider Yourself"".As is the case with even the greatest of musicals, a few of the songs go on for a very long time (i.e. ""Who Will Buy?"") -- sometimes, so long that you may find yourself reaching for the remote.But in the end, OLIVER! surprised me: I was not looking for a wonderful classic musical.

Indeed, with its high-energy performances, infectious music, steady direction by Sir Carol Reed and glorious sets, this movie won the 1968 Best Picture Oscar over such formidable competition as THE LION IN WINTER, CHARLEY, and FUNNY GIRL.Of course, most people are familiar with the classic story of young Oliver Twist, whose mother dies giving him birth and is forced to be raised under the cruel supervision of the English workhouse officials.  When he dares beg for more than his meager ration of gruel, the youngster is apprenticed to an undertaker and his extremely nasty family.  After escaping this hostile environment, he finds himself taken in by the roguish Fagin,  the Artful Dodger(Fagin's best pupil), and the rest of his band of young pickpockets.  In time, however, Oliver will find his home, but not before dealing with the likes of the brutal Bill Sikes with the help of Sike's sympathetic lover, Nancy, and the kindly Mr. Brownlow.As musical films go, it is hard to fault the wonderful casting in this film.  Mark Lester makes a perfectly, if maybe overly, innocent Oliver, while Jack Wild is a delight as the rascally Artful Dodger.  Shanie Wallis is heart-rending as the tragic Nancy.  Oliver Reed (Sir Carol's nephew) is truly scary as the menacing Bill Sikes.  Harry Secombe displays a glorious tenor in the comic role of Mr. Bumble, the beadle of the workhouse.  However, it is Ron Moody's fantastic performance of the rascally Fagin that steals this movie. It is not surprising, when you consider that he created the role when the musical was first produced in London.  Of course, the character itself has gone quite a change from Dickens' original, going from the debatably nasty anti-Semitic portrait of the novel  to that of  a lovable, if sneaky, eccentric.  Indeed, Moody's excellent portrayal would set the tone for almost all future performances of the role to date, including those of such actors as George C. Scott and Richard Dreyfus, among others.Some Dickens fans may quibble about the liberties taken with the book, from the softening of Fagin to the elimination of Oliver's evil step-brother Monks from the storyline.  And it isn't a perfect film by any means. (The child singer who dubbed Mark Lester's songs sounds like she's in an echo chamber of some sort, which makes Oliver's singing a jarring contrast to the rest of the cast.)  But, as a musical film, it is a wonderful entertainment and superb introduction to the classic story.  As a result, this is one musical that I would DEFINITELY recommend.",5,Moody's Fagin steals classic OLIVER!,1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,2729,"['CHICAGO', 'reenergized', 'movie', 'musical', 'genre', 'musical', 'version', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'immortal', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'was', 'widely', 'regarded', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'movie', 'musicals', 'Indeed', 'high-energy', 'performances', 'infectious', 'music', 'steady', 'direction', 'Sir', 'Carol', 'Reed', 'glorious', 'sets', 'movie', 'won', '1968', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'such', 'formidable', 'competition', 'LION', 'IN', 'WINTER', 'CHARLEY', 'FUNNY', 'GIRL.Of', 'course', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'familiar', 'classic', 'story', 'young', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'mother', 'giving', 'birth', 'forced', 'be', 'raised', 'cruel', 'supervision', 'English', 'workhouse', 'officials', 'When', 'beg', 'more', 'meager', 'ration', 'gruel', 'youngster', 'apprenticed', 'undertaker', 'extremely', 'nasty', 'family', 'escaping', 'hostile', 'environment', 'taken', 'roguish', 'Fagin', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'Fagin', 'best', 'pupil', 'rest', 'band', 'young', 'pickpockets', 'time', 'however', 'Oliver', 'will', 'find', 'home', 'not', 'dealing', 'likes', 'brutal', 'Bill', 'Sikes', 'help', 'Sike', 'sympathetic', 'lover', 'Nancy', 'kindly', 'Mr.', 'Brownlow.As', 'musical', 'films', 'go', 'hard', 'fault', 'wonderful', 'casting', 'film', 'Mark', 'Lester', 'perfectly', 'maybe', 'overly', 'innocent', 'Oliver', 'Jack', 'Wild', 'delight', 'rascally', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'Shanie', 'Wallis', 'heart-rending', 'tragic', 'Nancy', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'Sir', 'Carol', 'nephew', 'truly', 'scary', 'menacing', 'Bill', 'Sikes', 'Harry', 'Secombe', 'glorious', 'tenor', 'comic', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Bumble', 'beadle', 'workhouse', 'However', 'Ron', 'Moody', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'rascally', 'Fagin', 'movie', 'not', 'surprising', 'when', 'consider', 'created', 'role', 'when', 'musical', 'was', 'first', 'produced', 'London', 'course', 'character', 'gone', 'quite', 'change', 'Dickens', 'original', 'going', 'debatably', 'nasty', 'anti-Semitic', 'portrait', 'novel', 'lovable', 'sneaky', 'eccentric', 'Indeed', 'Moody', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'would', 'set', 'tone', 'almost', 'future', 'performances', 'role', 'date', 'including', 'such', 'actors', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'others.Some', 'Dickens', 'fans', 'may', 'quibble', 'liberties', 'taken', 'book', 'softening', 'Fagin', 'elimination', 'Oliver', 'evil', 'step-brother', 'Monks', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'film', 'means', 'child', 'singer', 'who', 'dubbed', 'Mark', 'Lester', 'songs', 'echo', 'chamber', 'sort', 'Oliver', 'singing', 'jarring', 'contrast', 'rest', 'cast', 'musical', 'film', 'wonderful', 'entertainment', 'superb', 'introduction', 'classic', 'story', 'result', 'one', 'musical', 'would', 'DEFINITELY', 'recommend']",N/A

With large musical numbers seeming starring every single person in England, Oliver! simply delivers. Such catchy tunes as Food Glorious Food and Consider Yourself will stick in ones head for days.In addition Oliver! boasts both a top-notch cast (with one exception) and incredible set design that invokes both the theater roots and the ability of film in one piece.The only problem with Oliver! musical is the source material. The original play is pretty awful. You have large dance numbers one minute and prostitutes being beaten to death by a shillelagh the next. Talk about your tone changes. The cast does well with these problems but the second half of the film simply seems like a completely different movie. And it is not an improvement. (They fortunately cut out murderous Bill Sikes musical number but Prostitutes Nancy's ode to wife beating is still in there.) In addition while the cast is almost uniformly excellent, the lead of Oliver (Mark Lester) is simply too angelic to be believed. He comes across as a Nambla poster boy. He seems to be watching everyone around him with a worried bemusement as if he was in the audience with us.Of course the moral of Oliver! is that everyone belongs in their own station. Oliver is discovered to be a nephew of a rich family and so is reunited with his station, the Artful Dodger having poor parentage stays a thief, and the prostitute ends up dead.One last note many concerned parent groups today would demand an R rating for Oliver!

11581,A6ADO7B6FUVN,0767812417,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[33, 44]","Charles Dickens' novel Oliver Twist received a musical adaptation in 1968 by Sir Carol Reed, and who would not be better than Reed to shoot this film.  A man with films such as Fallen Idol (1948), The Third Man (1949) and Our Man in Havana (1959) on his repertoire could generate the essential gloominess of Oliver Twist.  After all, visually he displayed his cinematic eye in The Third Man where he captured the dark and ominous atmosphere of Vienna's black market and underworld.  However, musicals tend to be perky and upbeat and this would be a sacrilegious illustration of Oliver Twist, as the story highlights the unjust social system under which many children were crushed under the advancement of the Industrial Revolution.  Thus, Reed faced a predicament, as he set out to make a musical based on one of the darker pieces of classic British literature.Oliver!, as Reed's cinematic version was titled, keeps close to the original tale of the orphan Oliver Twist who grew up under the abusive circumstances at a workhouse.  Workhouses were created to handle people with minor law violations, but also destitute and orphaned children.  Within these workhouses the conditions were often harsh and brutal while the inhabitants were forced into labor, as the managers ran the workhouses as they saw fit without consideration of humanity and compassion.  The film opens with a sketch that fades into motion where a small group of young orphans tread a crude machine into movement.  The first thought that strikes the audience is slavery, which is shortly followed by the dangers of the work environment.  Oliver is one of the kids that works on the wooden grinder that processes corn by striding the machine into movement.  To fully understand the situation of Oliver Twist, one must contemplate the historical, political and religious climate of the time, as the story presents a strong social criticism concealed under the fictitious tale of Oliver.Born in the workhouse as an illegitimate child, Oliver was placed on the fringe of society due to Christian values imposed by the leaders of the Church. In the workhouse, as we already know, he was forced into labor as a youngster while the common uneducated notion was that Oliver and kids alike were a bunch of freeloaders. In addition, some decades before Oliver Twist was written, more precisely 1815, the Corn Laws were introduced into the British Commonwealth. The Corn Laws implied that until the cost of corn reached a specific amount, no foreign corn could be imported onto British soil. Consequently, the price of food went up and the people were forced to spend most of their money on food while other merchandise became unessential, as food is a requirement for survival. Thus, in the light of this information, the audience can get a more accurate view of the opening and the desperation in which many characters lived.It is a rather grim historical and political perspective that Dickens presented to the public, and in the light of the governmental abuses of children, it might be rather distressing to hear that a musical was to be made of this tragic story.  Nonetheless, Reed approached the material with tactfulness while remaining true to the darker elements of the story.  For example, shortly after the scene of the kids treading on the machine, a group of wealthy and obese gentle men inspect the Workhouse.  However, instead of joining the orphans in their meal of gruel (made by the rest of the products that they cannot sell after having ground the corn) they enter a secluded area where a feast of meat, poultry, and other delicacies awaits.  This simple presentation of the socioeconomic levels offers a direct and transparent view of how the old British society oppressed most innocents - the children - for financial gain.The story continues with Oliver meeting the Artful Dodger (Jack Wild), Fagin (Ron Moody), Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed), and many others when he escapes his socially accepted bully and owner.  Through these characters, Reed captures Dickens socioeconomic status of the environment where the children act like miniature adults, as they smoke, steal, and dress like adults.  In addition, Reed displays the darkness of the environment in an authentic manner, as everything seems to be covered by soot generated by an overpopulated London and the Industrial Revolution's wonders.  The soot also presents a symbolic analogy to the political and economical situation, as the future seems oppressively bleak due to restrictive societal rights and an increasing poverty that no one can escape.  Thus, an emerging understanding for the desperation of many surfaces, as theft, exploitation of youth, and other illegal acts are committed.  Despite an increasing understanding for the desperate, both Dickens and Reed agree in their illustrations of Oliver Twist that certain behaviors are undesirable, which come to life through the character Bill Sikes.The knighted film director Sir Carol Reed took on Charles Dickens' majestic literary piece Oliver Twist and created a musical to which many might initially have had raised their objections.  However, Reed presents a tasteful adaptation that portrays the hopelessness, desperation, and a time of need for social change through the innocent child Oliver Twist. Song and music become an additional tool for Reed to display the miserable conditions of the people of the time.  Songs like ""You've Got To Pick A Pocket Or Two"" and ""Food, Glorious Food"" help enhance the visual experience, as the songs provide a new perspective on the socioeconomic setting.  Ultimately, the film offers an innovative viewpoint of a serious tale that will help others to open their minds and begin to contemplate the unjust world and its many transgressions against children and others less fortunate.Oliver! was a hit when it arrived to the Oscars in 1969, as it was nominated for 11 Oscars and brought home six of them such as Best Picture and Best Director.  These Oscars by themselves should tell the audience that this film is worth seeing, but if the viewers still are hesitant about this film, I must say that Oliver! offers a terrific cinematic experience.  Ron Moody's performance as Fagin is brilliant, he did not win the Oscar for this art, as it went to Cliff Robertson in Charly (1968), but it is a performance worth experiencing.  Personally, I thought Oliver Twist (1948) by David Lean was a straw better, but then again I am not partial to musicals.

11582,A2GPEV42IO41CI,0767812417,Kona,"[3, 3]","""Oliver!"" is the musical version of Dickens' tale about an orphan in Olde England. Oliver is born in a miserable workhouse and eventually taken in by an old thief and his merry band of boys who train him to be a pick-pocket. He meets some memorable characters along the way: Ron Moody plays the infamous Fagin, the leader of the thieves, with sinister delight. Jack Wild (the Artful Dodger) steals all his scenes with his talent and charm. Mark Lester, as Oliver, is a little wooden but looks the part and is appealing. Oliver Reed is convincingly repellant as nasty villain Bill Sikes, and Shani Wallis is good as his girlfriend, Nancy, the street girl with a heart of gold.Lionel Bart's music for ""Oliver!"" is absolutely enchanting. Each song is memorable and the big production numbers are a joy to behold. As the Artful Dodger welcomes Oliver to London with ""Consider Yourself,"" and the street vendors sing the beautiful, ""Who Will Buy?"", you are swept away into a magical world. ""You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two"" and ""Reviewing the Situation"" are Fagin's comic numbers that make you like him in spite of himself. ""Oliver!"" won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1968.

When a kid sees this movie for the first time (especially back then, before cable, video games, ipods, etc), it really does make a lasting impression on you. Too many memorable scenes to mention. I thought the Artful Dodger (Jack Wild) did an exceptional good job in this film, as so did Oliver Twist (Mark Lester), Nancy-the hot redheaded bar maid (Shani Wallis), bad guy Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed) and who could forget good 'ol half-hearted pick pocket master mind Fagin (Ron Moody)? Is it just me or could he have possibly modeled for Jethro Tull's 'Aqualung' lp? I usually can't stand show tunes, but out of the movie's fourteen songs, I liked ""Food, Glorious Food"", ""I'd Do Anything"", ""It's A Fine Life"" and the swinging ""Oom-Pah-Pah"".

It stars Mark Lester as the irrepressible street urchin, suckered into the lair of a vagabond by The Artful Dodger (Jack Wild) and forced into a life of crime by Fagin (Ron Moody). But when Oliver is salvaged from the slums by a benevolent philanthropist, Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed) decides to make a quick buck off of the trade. Shani Willis costars as Sikes' girlfriend, Nancy, who thwarts the kidnapping plot and pays for her betrayal with her life. This is a very stoic, stagy and rather dry musical that may capture the essence of Dickens in its settings characters and plot but seems totally out of touch with the effervescence of the traditional Hollywood musical.  Even with such main staple songs as ""Consider Yourself"", ""Boy For Sale"" and ""Food, Glorious Food"", truly, the spoon full of sugar remains a bitter pill to swallow on this occasion.Columbia Tri-Star has made ""Oliver"" available in a startlingly good looking transfer. Colors are solid, rich, vibrant and bold. Contrast levels are exactly where they should be. Blacks are incredibly deep. Fine detail is fully realized. Only occasionally do age related artifacts betray the vintage of the film. The audio is 5.1 and wonderfully spread across all five channels of the sound field. There are no extras.

The musical was an adaptation of Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist which follows the story of a nine-year old orphan, Oliver (Mark Lester), who is recruited by another orphan, The Artful Dodger (Jack Wild), to join a gang of pickpockets working for the unscrupulous Fagin (Ron Moody) and the murderous and reviled Sikes (Oliver Reed, the director's nephew).  Mr. Reed does a brilliant job through the first part of the film, relating the story almost exclusively through song and dance numbers including the wonderful ""Food, Glorious Food"", ""Boy For Sale"" and ""Consider Yourself"".  The second half of the film gets bogged down by some stilted dialogue and less musical numbers, but overall, the film is charming entertainment.  The cast is excellent, led by the young Mr. Wild, who is dead on as the Dodger and Mr. Moody who hits all the right notes as Fagin.  Both were nominated for Acting Oscars, Mr. Wild in Best Supporting category and Mr. Moody for Best Actor.

We put it on for xmas and happily, it was the perfect film for us all.First, the acting is simply first rate, from the unlovable Fagan and the sociopath Bill Sikes to the adorable Oliver and his flawed protector, the unfortunate Nancy.  Indeed, this was the film that made Oliver Reed a major star, and he is the perfect villain.  It engaged us completely, both on the emotional level but as a start of an historical discussion.  We all bonded over the film.  Second, the music is wonderful, even if Mark Lester only lip-synched.  My daughter loves musicals, so we will watch this many times with her.  Third, it is a rip-roaringly good story, however much Dickens relies on deus ex machina interventions to tidy things up at the end (usually in the form of a middle-class savior).

Perhaps the best and most  enthusiastically rendered vision of Charles Dickens' specific vision of  working class London, this movie literally teems with life, and paints a  vivid, emotional portrait of a scraggly band of petty thieves and crooks;  magically, the musical numbers not only provide a nice counter-balance to  the mounting brutality of the main story, but expand on it as well.

Mark Lester is a wondrous child actor, without a hint of  self-awareness, and a sweetly tiny soprano voice that can bring tears to  your eyes.  Carol Reed's enormous skill as a director has never been better  showcased than in his seemingly effortless coordination of scenes both  small and impossibly huge, as in the Who Will Buy? musical number, a  wondrous combo of precise choreography, soaring melody and layer upon layer  of visual joy.

11635,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,0767812417,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[5, 5]","OLIVER! (1968) is director Sir Carol Reed's Oscar-winning film of Lionel Bart's smash London and New York stage musical, which in turn is based on Charles Dickens' novel.  I think Dickens  would recognize his story here, despite 14 Bart songs.  An orphan named Oliver Twist (newcomer Mark Lester) falls in with a gang of pickpockets led by Fagin (spectacular Ron Moody) in the London underworld.  Oliver's age, the Artful Dodger (Oscar nominee Jack Wild) shows Oliver how it is done.  But a case of mistaken identity in crowded Covent Garden leads Oliver to have a new home in beautiful Bloomsbury.  INTERMISSION.Part two of OLIVER! has the terrifying criminal Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) and his likeable girlfriend Nancy (sensational Shani Wallis) on the trail of Oliver, kidnapping him back to Fagin's den to find out what he has told his rich benefactor.  Bill is so brutal that Nancy sides with Oliver, leading to a bleak plot development and eventually to a double happy ending.The songs in this dazzling Broadway musical are magnificent and have the vocal talents to do them justice:  The fabulous ""Who Will Buy?"" as a part two showstopper; Shani Wallis' exuberant ""Oom-Pah-Pah"" at the end; Ron Moody's ""Pick a Pocket or Two"" and ""Be Back Soon""; ""Consider Yourself"" and ""I'd Do Anything"".  Choreographer Onna White, who did THE MUSIC MAN six years earlier, earned a Special Oscar here.  The movie runs 153 minutes with roadshow and Intermission music restored, so it is probably the entire stage production.No one seems as well treated by filmmakers as Charles Dickens, from Selznick's towering DAVID COPPERFIELD and A TALE OF TWO CITIES (both 1935 MGM), to David Lean's GREAT EXPECTATIONS (1946, British) and OLIVER TWIST (1948, British), to everyone from Alistair Sim to the Muppets doing A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  Carol Reed's fabulous musical remake does not quite top Lean's non-musical OLIVER TWIST, but it is awfully good.  Oswald Morris gives the movie a B&W; color look in Panavision, and John Box's Oscar-winning sets are a marvel-bridges over rivers leading one way to Fagin's den and the other way to a downtown tavern, plus the crescent row of Bloomsbury mansions and parks that are the setting for the miraculous ""Who Will Buy?""The cast could not be better, especially Oscar nominee Ron Moody as a cunning Fagin, Oliver Reed as a chilling and brutal Bill Sykes, and a luminous Shani Wallis who brings the whole tavern to life with her exhilarating ""Oom-Pah-Pah"" as Nancy.  Newcomer Mark Lester as Oliver and young Jack Wild (another deserved Oscar nominee) as the Artful Dodger are very good.

11636,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,0767812417,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[1, 1]","This is a great film and true in spirit and basic plot to Dickens.  The songs are melodically  wonderful and the choreography is original, fresh and keeps your eyes constantly on the screen.  The movie is very well cast and Ron Moody is wonderful as Fagin.  He is ""nicer"" than in the book (maybe it's the pet owl they gave him)  but his basic motivations and actions remain the same albeit he has a happier more ambiguous ending in the film. Oliver Reed is probably a more physically attractive Bill Sikes than the one most people imagine from reading Dickens' work but he is certainly menacing and scary.  Nancy, also, is much lovelier (as well as older) than the novel describes  but the part is excellently acted and sung by Shani Wallis.  The child actors are all engaging and do not have the smugness (well the Artful and Charlie are supposed to be ""cheeky"") too many times seen in young kids in movies.The plot is simplified from the book and a few characters like Rose and Oliver's evil half brother Monks are left out for time's sake but it does not hurt the story since it could be argued that the original has too many complicated subplots.  Some ""exciting"" scenes are added for the action loving moviegoer and rather disturbingly innocent Oliver is present at the scenes of both Nancy and Bill's demise. Mr. and Mrs. Bumble do not have the larger, very comic, parts they play in both the novel and the originial musical though  Mr. Bumble's ""the law then sir is a bachelor...and may he learn from experience""  speech is included and is almost word for word from Dicken's original writing as are many other critical speeches throughout the film.  Oliver is a wonderful gem the whole family can enjoy.

11638,A220FJEQNGMSRN,0767812417,Trevor Willsmer,"[2, 2]","Carol Reed's screen version of Lionel Bart's musical version of Oliver Twist seems to fall into the love it or hate it category. Many find stodgy and drawn-out and even its admirers have to admit it is not without its faults. Some of the frenetic moments are not best timed and at times the performances are pitched more for the theatre than for the screen. Nonetheless, it is one of the very few successful British musicals and as such has much to recommend it.Among a colourful cast, Harry Secombe's Mr Bumble is right out of Dickens' pages while Ron Moody's Fagin and Jack Wild's Artful Dodger are an engaging pair. As Bill Sykes, Oliver Reed makes a (by his standards) restrained and effective villain - his first appearance is a marvellously handled moment. If his uncle's direction is sometimes uncertain, the production values are sumptuous, with John Box's intricately haphazard sets and Phyllis Dalton's intelligently designed costumes coming over particularly well.Bart's score is unusually strong and Onna White's choreography, while not without its tired and contrived moments, is considerably more energetic and enjoyable than is the norm for these shores. Indeed, Consider Yourself, which seems to call upon the entire city of London, is an outstandingly staged number by any standards. With the exception of some ill-advised string work on As Long As He Needs Me that sounds more South Seas than South London, Johnny Green's orchestrations are for the most part fine.With Reed and cinematographer Oswald Morris both showing a good eye for the Scope frame, although the colour somewhat muted - it's a feature of Morris' work that the original colours were deliberately graded to reflect colour prints from the Victorian era.",5,Considerably better than it's modern reputation,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,1738,"['Carol', 'Reed', 'screen', 'version', 'Lionel', 'Bart', 'musical', 'version', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'fall', 'love', 'hate', 'category', 'Many', 'find', 'stodgy', 'drawn-out', 'even', 'admirers', 'have', 'admit', 'not', 'faults', 'frenetic', 'moments', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'timed', 'times', 'performances', 'are', 'pitched', 'more', 'theatre', 'screen', 'Nonetheless', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'successful', 'British', 'musicals', 'such', 'much', 'recommend', 'it.Among', 'colourful', 'cast', 'Harry', 'Secombe', 'Mr', 'Bumble', 'right', 'Dickens', 'pages', 'Ron', 'Moody', 'Fagin', 'Jack', 'Wild', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'are', 'engaging', 'pair', 'Bill', 'Sykes', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'standards', 'restrained', 'effective', 'villain', 'first', 'appearance', 'marvellously', 'handled', 'moment', 'uncle', 'direction', 'sometimes', 'uncertain', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'sumptuous', 'John', 'Box', 'intricately', 'haphazard', 'sets', 'Phyllis', 'Dalton', 'intelligently', 'designed', 'costumes', 'coming', 'particularly', 'well.Bart', 'score', 'unusually', 'strong', 'Onna', 'White', 'choreography', 'not', 'tired', 'contrived', 'moments', 'considerably', 'more', 'energetic', 'enjoyable', 'norm', 'shores', 'Indeed', 'Consider', 'Yourself', 'call', 'entire', 'city', 'London', 'outstandingly', 'staged', 'number', 'standards', 'exception', 'ill-advised', 'string', 'work', 'As', 'Long', 'Me', 'more', 'South', 'Seas', 'South', 'London', 'Johnny', 'Green', 'orchestrations', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'fine.With', 'Reed', 'cinematographer', 'Oswald', 'Morris', 'showing', 'good', 'eye', 'Scope', 'frame', 'colour', 'somewhat', 'muted', 'feature', 'Morris', 'work', 'original', 'colours', 'were', 'deliberately', 'graded', 'reflect', 'colour', 'prints', 'Victorian', 'era']",N/A

All these little cockers, why weren't those children in school?I, Yasha J. Banana, your 96-years-old Amazon movie reviewer, while I don't go back as far as Charles Dickens, I can assure you that in my day little children weren't running around the streets picking people's pockets, rolling on the ground, leaping from furniture and running into buildings.  Ho boy!  After I watched this movie I was out of breath.  It took me 15 minutes to get my heart started again.Didn't the people who made this movie ever hear of child labor laws?When I was a kid, do you think I picked pockets?  Never!  NEVER!  These kinderlekhs, these litle brats, they couldn't learn a trade?  There wasn't anybody in London back then who could teach them to block hats or maybe fix yo-yos?A decent trade, that's what they needed.  A decent trade, a cup coco and an orange, that's what every boychick needs, minimum.Later on they can take in a partner.Also, these kids never heard of Barney's Boy's Town?  A pressed pair of pants they couldn't steal?  A bar of soap was locked in a vault?  A decent pair of shoes weren't invented?Listen, I don't mean to be picky, and far be it for me to insist on realism, but all these people living in a hovel -- Fagan, the Dead End Kids, rogue elements of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir -- and how many bathrooms were there?  Huh?  All you feency-schmeency movie reviewing maven, did you ever think of that?  No sir!  I didn't see one crapper in the whole movie.  Not a flush or a fart in the entire show.Kids love to fart, but I didn't hear a-one.  Not a peep, not a titter.  Where's the realism?  Where's the verisimilitude?  Let just two of my great-grandchildren come over and what happens, they immediately start farting and then they blame it on me.  ""Grandpa Yasha is farting, Mama!  Grandpa Yasha is farting, Mama!""Charles Dickens, I doubt very much, had kids.  Maybe one or two, but a hovel full?  Who's kidding who?  And then what, a senior citizen takes them into the streets to pick pockets all day?  Listen, take it from me, your typical senior citizen gets tired watching paint dry.  Besides which, once he got them all outside, I guarantee you, half of them would have to go tinkle.Or worse.Job himself would have started throwing those kids out the window.  Alphabetically.And the woman in the movie who's supposed to be the mother-figure, Nancy.  Oh, what a grand old time she had!  Dancing around the place with the kids: singing, laughing, carrying on.  Do you know the only time I danced with my mother?  It was back in 1921 when I was seven-years-old; right after she gave me an enema.  Such dancing on the way to the crapper you never saw in your life!And, mind you, this wasn't no Fleet's enema.  A Fleet's enema couldn't clean out a chicken, believe me.  This was an enema bag she held over her head like the Sword of Damacles.  Big as a Voit basketball.But what do you care about my bowel movements, past or present?Getting back to this Nancy dame. ... She didn't care if any of the kids married outside their faith?  Okay, okay, so who am I to express an opinion; but a real mother would have asked a question here and there, don't you think?And poor Charles Dickens.  When did he write a musical about crazy people dancing in the streets in the slums with the rats and the dreck?  And what about his descendants? -- did they make a few dollars from this movie, from all the hocking and schlepping and tumbling and spritzing?In conclusion, and so that I shouldn't say another word on the subjecte ... Ron Moody, the fellow who plays Fagan, a nice Jewish man.  Almost as old as me.  And Mark Lester, the boychick who plays Oliver, also a Jew.  But, boys, fellas, you need this?  You couldn't get into a movie where you sit in front of a computer and blow up half of Manhattan; or else knock off a bank for a few billion dollars?  Since when do Jewish boys spin and do cartwheels and throw thmselves against walls, already?I don't know, maybe life has passed me by; at 96-years-old if it wasn't for my two martinis and my Rosary I'd never make it through the day....
