546604,A1VG2OPJGFC0BJ,B00003TFS5,Dennis F. Towle,"[10, 10]","Tim McGraw is a great singer in Country music! He has ruled the charts with the modern(progressive)Country sound that Garth Brooks first incorporated in his music, in 1989. Although I enjoy all the hits that McGraw has earned, I am disappointed with this DVD video collection. It is missing my favorite song/video: Everywhere....it's also missing Not A Moment Too Soon, Refried Dreams and Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me(with his beautiful wife, Faith Hill). I wish that Curb Records would have put out a more complete Tim McGraw video collection for his fans to thoroughly enjoy, like myself!",3,"Great Country singer....great songs, but missing more hits..",1014940800,"03 1, 2002",2002,599,"['Tim', 'McGraw', 'great', 'singer', 'Country', 'music', 'ruled', 'charts', 'modern', 'progressive', 'Country', 'sound', 'Garth', 'Brooks', 'first', 'incorporated', 'music', '1989', 'enjoy', 'hits', 'McGraw', 'earned', 'am', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'video', 'collection', 'missing', 'favorite', 'song/video', 'Everywhere', '.it', 'also', 'missing', 'Not', 'A', 'Moment', 'Too', 'Soon', 'Refried', 'Dreams', 'Just', 'Hear', 'Say', 'Love', 'Me', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Faith', 'Hill', 'wish', 'Curb', 'Records', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'out', 'more', 'complete', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'video', 'collection', 'fans', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy']",N/A
