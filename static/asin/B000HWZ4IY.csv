This is easily the least season, too in every respect. To begin with, there was only one appearance by Don Knotts as Barney Fife. There was also very real fatigue present throughout most of the episodes, all too evident in most of Andy Griffith's half-hearted and lifeless performances. The show really dried up plain-and-simple, when Don Knotts left. The wonderful chemistry between Andy and Barney was gone. Not to mention that by this time several other popular characters had either left the show or were seldom seen, which further weakened the series. At its worst, the show probably was at least as good as any other comedy series of the late 1960's, but if you are a real devotee of the show, you know the series had already gone way past its prime by the Eighth and Final Season. I plan to buy this DVD set just to make my collection complete, but for me anyway, I already have the show at its very best.",3,Easy to see why it was the Final Season,1160697600,"10 13, 2006",2006,1048,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'show', 'original', 'broadcasts', '1960', 'too', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'Final', 'Season', 'easily', 'least', 'season', 'too', 'respect', 'begin', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'appearance', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'real', 'fatigue', 'present', 'most', 'episodes', 'too', 'evident', 'most', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'half-hearted', 'lifeless', 'performances', 'show', 'really', 'dried', 'up', 'plain-and-simple', 'when', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'left', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'Andy', 'Barney', 'was', 'gone', 'Not', 'mention', 'time', 'several', 'other', 'popular', 'characters', 'had', 'left', 'show', 'were', 'seldom', 'seen', 'further', 'weakened', 'series', 'worst', 'show', 'probably', 'was', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'comedy', 'series', 'late', '1960', 'are', 'real', 'devotee', 'show', 'know', 'series', 'had', 'already', 'gone', 'way', 'prime', 'Eighth', 'Final', 'Season', 'plan', 'buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'just', 'make', 'collection', 'complete', 'anyway', 'already', 'have', 'show', 'very', 'best']",The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete Final Season

Many of the black and white episodes with Barney, I have seen well over 100 times I'm sure if not more and I never get tired of them. They actually get funnier with age. The show was good clean fun that the whole family could enjoy. The creators and actors of TAGS were brilliant. They knew how to make comedy clean and hillarious at the same time. Unlike the trash that you see on TV today. The first 5 seasons of this show was by far the best, but the entire series was great overall. I wish more shows today were like The Andy Griffith Show.

1017114,A1NF9WS7RR82MX,B000HWZ4IY,J. Hill,"[0, 0]","Season 8 is the last one for The Andy Griffith Show, and that&#8217;s fitting given the number of old characters who no longer appear.  Barney Fife only makes it for one episode, Floyd is gone, no Thelma Lou, no Otis, no mayor&#8230;and in their place are Howard Sprague and Emmett Clark.  I like Howard and Emmett, but they aren&#8217;t as great as the old characters that made the show so fun.  Even though it&#8217;s hard not to miss Barney, Floyd, and the rest, many of these episodes are still funny.  Besides several storylines about Howard and Emmett, like Howard falling in love with Millie and Emmett going to work as an insurance salesman, some of the episodes focus on Goober and his own new love interest.  A few episodes toward the end of the season set up the spinoff show, Mayberry R.F.D., including the pilot of that show.  It&#8217;s sad that The Andy Griffith Show had to come to an end, but from everything I read, Griffith was tired of playing the character, and with so many important characters gone, it made sense to finish the show with Season 8.  It might not reach the standards of the five black-and-white seasons, but it still offers plenty of laughs and good times in Mayberry.

1017115,A19XE6G6NDZFPS,B000HWZ4IY,Joanna Mechlinski,"[3, 3]","I'm so glad these DVD box sets exist, because they gave a twenty-something such as myself the opportunity to become acquainted with one of America's finest television programs. It took me nearly a year, but I've finally made my way through the entire run...The story is set in the fictitious little town of Mayberry, North Carolina during the early 1960s. Sheriff Andy Taylor (played by Andy Griffith) is a widower with a small son. He asks his Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier) back in Season 1 to move in with him and six-year-old Opie (Ron Howard) as housekeeper and surrogate mother.Many of the storylines center upon Opie's childhood dilemmas and coming-of-age situations. While Andy is quick to discipline his son, he is also understanding of the gray areas a child might encounter, and no matter the outcome of a situation, he strives to enforce in Opie the need for kindness and truth.In this season, Opie is entering adolescence, as is addressed by episodes such as ""Opie's Girlfriend,"" where the 13-year-old wants to take his crush to a friend's party, but finds she's waiting for a better offer.Mayberry also includes a number of unique residents, such as Goober, the friendly, childlike mechanic; Helen, Andy's girlfriend and Opie's teacher; Howard, the shy county clerk who's just beginning to come out from under his mother's thumb. This season also introduces store owner Emmett, and Sam, who will replace Andy as sheriff in the spinoff, ""Mayberry R.F.D.""One of my main peeves is Andy and Helen's endless courtship. How many times in the past few seasons has ""X comes to town, and makes Andy or Helen jealous"" come into the storyline? It gets incredibly tedious to see over and over again. If they were THAT jealous, they'd simply get married or else just break up. But they continue ""going together"" for years, as though they are adolescents. Eventually, they do marry, but it happens in the spin-off...so as far as TAGS viewers are concerned, it's like it *never* happens.Plus, Sam becomes a key character in the last few episodes. All of a sudden, he's practically Andy's best friend...when no one ever heard of him before. I understand they're trying to set up the characters for the spin-off, but seriously! Make it a LITTLE believable...I also don't like the way Floyd simply disappears, like Ellie, Warren and a few others. Floyd, however, was a central character for SEVEN CONSECUTIVE SEASONS - the least they could do is give some sort of exposition for his leaving, and not insult viewers' intelligence.If you haven't ever seen an episode of ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" give this box set a try!

This last season DOES have it's memorable moments though: Goober is mis-matched with computer dating, Howard retires to a tropical island, Howard turns his house into a swingin' bachelor pad, Andy discovers Helen was arrested in Kansas City and Barney visits & turns the Taylor home into a summit meeting.We still have Andy, Opie, Aunt Bee and Clara Edwards; but by this time, many characters we came to love on this show were gone: Floyd, Otis, Ernest T. Bass, Gomer, Barney, Thelma Lou, The Darling Family, Rafe Hollister, Leon, Ben Weaver and other lesser but recognizable town characters, like the one played by Burt Mustin. Instead, we have the replacements: Goober, Howard, Emmett & Martha Clark and, by the last four episodes, Sam & Mike Jones. These last four episodes are hard to watch, as Ken Berry just doesn't fit in. Berry was great on ""F-Troop"" and ""Mama's Family,"" but here his character is as bland and useless as soggy cardboard...and when his son Mike calls him ""Paw,"" there's no southern twang in his voice; he sounds like a geeky city boy!

This season is good if you just want to complete your collection of tags. There are some funny episodes in this set. When Howard goes to the south seas is pretty funny. The show had a good run, although they lost something when Barney left the show, they did manage to keep it going for a couple of years. I really didn't get into the next set which is Mayberry RFD. They tried but, like everything else, all good things must come to an end. Barney shows up for one last time when he hosts a summit meeting. You can see that Don knotts is getting old & tried also. By this season he is well on his way making movies & didn't have time for the tags show anymore. Gomer has his own show also. You can see that Floyd's barber shop has been turned into Emmet's fix it shop. Nothing is the same in this last season.

But the ""color years"" (seasons 6 through 8), as controversial as they are among fans, still contain a wealth of material that's far superior to what passes as a ""sitcom"" on modern television. The final season carried on without Floyd (one of the most vital characters, next to Barney Fife). It featured an extreme overdose of Howard Sprague...reminds me of the old SCTV skit in which ""Floyd"" (Eugene Levy) goes to Godfather ""Don Caballero"" (Joe Flaherty) to ""ask a favor""...""I want you to kill Howard Sprague""...now THAT'S classic. The one essential episode in the final season is ""Opie's Group""...it's true classic television cheese as Opie rocks the nation, stopping only to have Emmett at the Fix-It shop ""adjust his amp"" (perhaps to make it go to 11?)...If you love rock and roll, and you love the Andy Griffith show, get season 8.

1017127,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B000HWZ4IY,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[67, 70]","Season 8 was the final season of the Andy Griffith Show.  The last episodes of this season introduced the character Sam Jones (Ken Berry) who would continue the Mayberry tradition in the series Mayberry RFD that would last three seasons and did well in the ratings until it and other rural-oriented shows were canceled.  Season 8 of TAGS was the only season the legendary sitcom was rated #1.  Perhaps it was known that this would be the final season, so folks tuned in knowing a good thing was about to end.  I like seasons six and seven and I think the color seasons are, for the most part, terribly underrated, but season 8 is my least favorite.  Reviewing the list of episodes, only ""Howard the Bowler,"" ""The Wedding,"" and ""Goober Goes to the Auto Show"" I consider to be above average. The rest are rather stale.  Don Knotts makes one appearance in the rather odd episode ""Barney Hosts a Summit Meeting.""  Here's what you get:""Opie's First Love"": Opie's big date jilts him for another guy.""Howard the Bowler"":  In a bowling match between Mayberry and Mt. Pilot, Howard is one strike away from a perfect game only to have the lights go out due to a power overload.  He has a day to think about it before he tries for the final strike.""A Trip to Mexico"":  Aunt Bee wins a trip to Mexico and takes two of her friends.  She learns that one of the best ways to lose friends is to travel with them.""Andy's Trip to Raleigh"":  Another Helen blow-up episode.  This time, Andy meets with a lawyer in Raleigh but doesn't let Helen know the minor detail of the lawyer being a hot female.""Opie Steps Up in Class"": Opie becomes friends with a kid from a wealthy family and Andy and Aunt Bee fear they won't be able to measure up.""Howard's Main Event"": Howard becomes friends with a girl who works at the bakery but is confronted by her ex-boyfriend (Allan Melvin).""Aunt Bee the Juror"":  Jack Nicholson appears in this episode.  Aunt Bee serves on a jury and is the only one who believes Nicholson's character is not guilty.""The Tape Recorder"":  Opie and Arnold tape record a conversation between a prisoner and his attorney and find out the location of stolen loot.  Andy refuses to listen to the tape because it goes against attorney/client confidentiality.""Opie's Group"":  Opie is guitarist in a rock band and Clara warns them about the extravagance of making music the main part of one's life--and then joins the band.""Aunt Bee and the Lecturer"":  Aunt Bee is creeped out when a lecturer falls for her because she reminds him of his departed wife.""Andy's Investment"":  To help pay for Opie's college education, Andy moonlights as an owner of a laundromat and finds it may be more trouble than its worth.  Sensing the dilemma, Opie reconsiders his future plans.""Howard and Millie"":  Howard proposes to Millie (rather sudden?) and, on the train ride to visit Millie's family, find many areas where they are not compatible.  You'd think Millie and Howard would've had more episodes together before this step, but I guess the series was moving things along quickly in their last season.""Aunt Bee's Cousin"":  The episodes where relatives or old friends visit Aunt Bee are usually my least favorites, and this one is no exception.  Aunt Bee's cousin tries to get her involved in a business venture but turns out to be all talk.""Suppose Andy Gets Sick"": Andy not having a deputy for the last two and  seasons was rather unrealistic and it shows in this episode.  Goober makes a mess of things when he fills in for an ailing Andy.""Howard's New Life"":  A rather strange episode.  Howard decides to move to a Caribbean island, but soon realizes his pot of gold is back in Mayberry.""Goober the Executive"":  Goober buys Wally's service station and worries he may not be cut out to be the boss.""The Mayberry Chef"":  Aunt Bee stars in a cooking show and Opie and Andy find out it is much nicer eating Aunt Bee's cooking than watching it on television.""Emmet's Brother-in-Law"":  Emmett's wife convinces him to join her brother's insurance agency, but his heart remains in his fix-it shop.""Opie's Drugstore Job"":  At his new job at the drugstore, Opie accidentally breaks an expensive bottle of perfume and decides to buy one to replace it before his boss can find out.""The Church Benefactors"":  The church committee is torn between spending its funds on repairing the church building or buying new choir robes.""Barney Hosts a Summit Meeting"":  Mayberry takes on the Cold War.  This episode, to me, is way over-the-top.  Barney arranges for a meeting between Russian and American diplomats to take place in Mayberry, which turns out to be Andy's kitchen (another kitchen debate?).""Goober Goes to an Auto Show"":  Goober meets up with an old friend who appears to be a big success, so Goober is loose with his money so as to appear a big shot and goes in over his head.  Later, Goober has the chance to get revenge, but demonstrates he is a success in ways other than money.Aunt Bee's Big Moment"":  Feeling like she has not accomplished much in her life, Aunt Bee takes flying lessons and prepares for her solo.""Helen's Past"":  Andy finds a newspaper clipping showing Helen being arrested and decides to investigate further.  When a busybody from the school board finds out, she decides Miss Crump may not be appropriate teacher material.""Emmett's Anniversary"":  Emmett considers buying his wife a fur coat for their anniversary.  He decides it is out of his means, but his wife learns about his plans.""The Wedding"":  Howard's mother finally remarries and he fixes up his house to be a swinging bachelor pad (he sure forgot about Millie fast).  The parties he puts on are very square until Emmett shows up.""Sam for Town Council"":  Enter Sam Jones, a respected farmer who Andy urges to run for town council (funny, we never heard of him before until now).  His opponent is Emmett.""Opie and Mike"":  A bully threatens Sam's son, Mike.  Opie becomes Mike's protector and Mike becomes overly dependent on Opie's friendship and is hurt when Opie's attentions turn to a new girl in town.  There is a reference to the slightly controversial episode ""Opie and the Bully."" Sam Jones doesn't go along with Andy's idea of letting his son confront the bully.""A Girl for Goober"":  A lady psychologist uses a computer match-making questionnaire for research purposes and is hooked up with Goober (they both read a lot; well, Goober reads lots of comic books anyway).""Mayberry RFD"":  The characters in the next Mayberry series are introduced as Sam takes in an Italian family.  Rather stereotypical, but that's how television was back then.",3,"""My pot of gold's right here in Mayberry""---Howard Sprague",1158969600,"09 23, 2006",2006,6599,"['Season', '8', 'was', 'final',

Would have liked to had more extras but to get the episodes complete and uncut, and at a very reasonable price has been just great.Again, season 8 is probably the weakest year, but it's still Andy.  Some episodes Andy does look like he's sleepwalking through the motions.  But, for me, the best part is to see these episodes without all the syndication cuts for the first time since original broadcast.  In many ways, it's like seeing these for the first time.For me, the epilogue in the episode ""Howard's New Life"" sums up the essence of Mayberry.  Goober, Andy, Emmett, and Howard sitting around the gas station at sunset having a bottle of pop.

1017137,A2OYMBKTO5ASY4,B000HWZ4IY,Terry L. Vinson,"[55, 60]","To this point I've reviewed all seven seasons of TAGS, my all-time favorite show.  This is the first season I've given less than at least four stars.  My reasons? Simply that in my opinion this was the weakest season of the series.  Andy Griffith had basically been 'bribed' to come back for an eighth season, and in the last five or so episodes it was clear the show was being groomed for Ken Berry and the 'Mayberry RFD' years.  Still, there are a few hidden gems in there, including:Episode 221: 'Goober, The Executive'.  Goober buys the filling station from Wally, and is soon gulping down aspirin like M&M;'s while trying to figure how to keep the place afloat.Episode 224: 'Howard, The Bowler'.  Howard is one ball away from a perfect game after a power outage cuts off his hot streak.Episode 232: 'Suppose Andy Gets Sick'.  Andy catches a touch of the flu, leaving Goober in charge of local law enforcement, with predictable results.  (NOTE: Hey, isn't that 'Asa' the former bank security guard playing the town doctor? Man, that Asa is sure 'multi-talented')Episode 235: 'Howard's New Life'.  Howard chunks it all for the island life, but finds the end of his rainbow lies in good ol' Mayberry after all.  The ending of this episode is truly one of the best the color years has to offer.Episode 240: ""Barney Hosts a Summit Meeting'. Big Barn's last appearance.  Just listen to him butcher the Russian representative's name as only 'Fast Gun Fife' could.  Don Knotts won his fifth emmy award from this episode.Definitely the weakest the show had to offer was season eight, though as I've said before, even the 'worst' of TAGS beats the majority of today's TV 'best'.I truly hope Paramount follows this up with the 1986 movie 'Return to Mayberry', thus finishing off my collectin of TAGS in style.",3,"'TAGS' goes out on top, at least in the ratings....as far as the show itself, well....",1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,1803,"['point', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'seven', 'seasons', 'TAGS', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'show', 'first', 'season', ""'ve"", 'given', 'less', 'least', 'four', 'stars', 'reasons', 'Simply', 'opinion', 'was', 'weakest', 'season', 'series', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'had', 'basically', 'been', ""'bribed"", 'come', 'back', 'eighth', 'season', 'last', 'five', 'so', 'was', 'clear', 'show', 'was', 'being', 'groomed', 'Ken', 'Berry', ""'Mayberry"", 'RFD', 'years', 'Still', 'are', 'few', 'hidden', 'gems', 'there', 'including', 'Episode', '221', ""'Goober"", 'Executive', 'Goober', 'filling', 'station', 'Wally', 'soon', 'gulping', 'down', 'aspirin', 'M', 'M', 'trying', 'figure', 'how', 'keep', 'place', 'afloat.Episode', '224', ""'Howard"", 'Bowler', 'Howard', 'one', 'ball', 'away', 'perfect', 'game', 'power', 'outage', 'cuts', 'hot', 'streak.Episode', '232', ""'Suppose"", 'Andy', 'Gets', 'Sick', 'Andy', 'touch', 'flu', 'leaving', 'Goober', 'charge', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'predictable', 'results', 'NOTE', 'Hey', ""n't"", ""'Asa"", 'former', 'bank', 'security', 'guard', 'playing', 'town', 'doctor', 'Man', 'Asa', 'sure', ""'multi-talented"", 'Episode', '235', ""'Howard"", 'New', 'Life', 'Howard', 'island', 'life', 'end', 'rainbow', 'good', 'ol', 'Mayberry', 'ending', 'episode', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'color', 'years', 'offer.Episode', '240', 'Barney', 'Summit', 'Meeting', 'Big', 'Barn', 'last', 'appearance', 'Just', 'listen', 'butcher', 'Russian', 'representative', 'name', 'only', 'Gun', 'Fife', 'could', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'won', 'fifth', 'emmy', 'award', 'episode.Definitely', 'weakest', 'show', 'had', 'offer', 'was', 'season', 'eight', ""'ve"", 'said', 'even', ""'worst"", 'TAGS', 'majority', 'today', 'TV', ""'best'.I"", 'truly', 'hope', 'Paramount', 'up', '1986', 'movie', ""'Return"", 'Mayberry', 'thus', 'finishing', 'off', 'collectin', 'TAGS', 'style']",The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete Final Season

The show is timeless and quite literally the most entertaining television show I've ever seen in my 57 years.
