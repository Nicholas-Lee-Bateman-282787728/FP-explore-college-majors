It is a story about Belle's love for Christmas and her quest to bring it to the Beast's castle - with the help of the enchanted objects.The Beast and Forte dislike holidays.  Forte does his best to stop Belle from bringing the spirit of Christmas to the castle. There are some scary parts for the very young, however my 4 & 5 year old girls didn't seem to be bothered by them.This movie has wonderful music, excellent animations, and a happy ending!1smileycat :-)",5,Wonderful!,1047859200,"03 17, 2003",2003,563,"['movie', 'time', 'original', 'movie', 'Belle', 'won', 'Beast', 'heart', 'story', 'Belle', 'love', 'Christmas', 'quest', 'bring', 'Beast', 'castle', 'help', 'enchanted', 'objects.The', 'Beast', 'Forte', 'dislike', 'holidays', 'Forte', 'best', 'stop', 'Belle', 'bringing', 'spirit', 'Christmas', 'castle', 'are', 'scary', 'parts', 'very', 'young', 'however', '4', '5', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'bothered', 'them.This', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'music', 'excellent', 'animations', 'happy', 'ending', '1smileycat']",Disney's Beauty and the Beast - The Enchanted Christmas VHS

The songs are nothing compared to the original animated feature but still it's worth a check. It revives Disney's magical tale that earned an Oscar nominee for best picture! Note: Unlike the Oscar-winning feature, this is something that will probably appeal more to kids- so based on a children's perspective (younger cousins) I give it a 5- but unlike the original feature that I gave a 5-star to, I give this a 2-3 star from an adult's perspective.The tale revolves around the lovable cast celebrating Christmas a year after what you saw in the original tale. They all start to have an argument over who saved Christmas the year before. They then go back to the original tale but in more detail this time. There are more new characters and a whole new villain. The 'musical' villain serves as a friend to the Beast. He's quite jealous and his music helps the Beast relax. Watch how the characters plan, sing, destroy, and save Christmas!The story is of coarse nothing compared to Disney's Beauty and the Beast.

I unfortunately did not get it the last time it was out, and have regretted it ever since. This movie is a wonderful tale of Belle's first Christmas in the castle (it is supposed to be during the time the last movie took place, only before the beast's transformation back into a man- it is presented in a flashback form.) The same old characters from the original Beauty and the Beast are here, along with a couple new characters- including Fife (a picollo) and Forte (a huge pipe organ voiced by the always fabulous Tim Curry) and Angelique (the Christmas angel who was once the castle's decorator voiced by the incredible Bernadette Peters.) Forte was once the court's composer but he is quite content with staying the was he is because, as he says, ""humanity is overrated"". He also feels more appreciated and needed as the organ, because the beast enjoys his melancholy music. The plot revolves around the castle trying to plan a Christmas, even though the beast banned it after being cursed because it brought back painful memories of his human years and the time he turned into the beast (which is portrayed in this movie as happening at Christmas), and Forte's attempt to stop Christmas from happening and also destroying Belle so she cannot fall in love with the beast and restore their humanity. The movie does not take anything away from the original and is rather a fantastic companion to Beauty and the Beast. It includes some great new songs, including ""As Long As There's Christmas"", ""Stories"", and ""Don't Fall In Love"". Like the original Beauty and the Beast, the film does have some dark moments- the beast's anger is once again shown and Forte is very sinister- but this is a Christmas movie and we know that Belle and the Beast do eventualy fall in love, so the happily ever after is inevitable.",5,So excited that this is being released again!,1320451200,"11 5, 2011",2011,1927,"['one', 'movies', 'will', 'disappear', 'Disney', 'vault', 'only', 'be', 'released', '10', 'years', 'so', 'unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'out', 'have', 'regretted', 'ever', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'Belle', 'first', 'Christmas', 'castle', 'supposed', 'be', 'time', 'last', 'movie', 'took', 'place', 'only', 'beast', 'transformation', 'back', 'man-', 'presented', 'flashback', 'form', 'same', 'old', 'characters', 'original', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'are', 'here', 'couple', 'new', 'characters-', 'including', 'Fife', 'picollo', 'Forte', 'huge', 'pipe', 'organ', 'voiced', 'always', 'fabulous', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Angelique', 'Christmas', 'angel', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'castle', 'decorator', 'voiced', 'incredible', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Forte', 'was', 'once', 'court', 'composer', 'quite', 'content', 'staying', 'was', 'because', 'humanity', 'overrated', 'also', 'more', 'appreciated', 'needed', 'organ', 'beast', 'melancholy', 'music', 'plot', 'castle', 'trying', 'plan', 'Christmas', 'even', 'beast', 'banned', 'being', 'cursed', 'brought', 'back', 'painful', 'memories', 'human', 'years', 'time', 'turned', 'beast', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'happening', 'Christmas', 'Forte', 'attempt', 'stop', 'Christmas', 'happening', 'also', 'destroying', 'Belle', 'can', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'beast', 'restore', 'humanity', 'movie', 'not', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'original', 'rather', 'fantastic', 'companion', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'great', 'new', 'songs', 'including', 'As', 'Long', 'Christmas', 'Stories', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Fall', 'Love', 'original', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'film', 'have', 'dark', 'moments-', 'beast', 'anger', 'once', 'again', 'shown', 'Forte', 'very', 'sinister-', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'know', 'Belle', 'Beast', 'do', 'eventualy', 'fall', 'love', 'happily', 'ever', 'inevitable']",Disney's Beauty and the Beast - The Enchanted Christmas VHS

The truth is, every person, living in this planet in the last eleven or twelve years, probably has seen or heard about it -- one of Disney's biggest blockbusters in recent history. The truth, also, is that no child's movie collection can be without this classic. And a great addition to their collection for the coming holidays happens to the equally wonderful ""Beauty and the Beast - The Enchanted Christmas"" in its brand new Blu-ray edition.The story of the film is quite simple, really, but incredibly fulfilling. It begins one night, around Christmas time, when Mrs. Potts is requested by the guys at the castle to tell a story about Christmas past, when the Prince was still a Beast, and Belle was still his captive. And it goes like this: One day, during Christmas Eve, Belle decides to celebrate this glorious holiday, and convinces everyone in the castle to help her to arrange a big Christmas gala. It was meant to be a surprise for the Beast, who, unbeknown to Belle, hates this holiday due to bad memories from the past. Everything is going well until Forte, the former, jealous, and sour court composer, decides to prevent the celebration to take place. Forte thinks that ""humanity is over-rated"" and that ""happiness is depressing."" Accordingly, he devises his own plan to stop Belle's noble effort.Beauty and the Beast - The Enchanted Christmas"" is good, old-fashioned animation at its best, full of great colors and inspirational, tender moments - perfect for the family to enjoy together and an awesome gift for the kids.

426532,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6304501153,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 5]","In 1991, Walt Disney Animation Studios debuted their 30th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics line and the film would achieve commercial success as it earned over $377 million worldwide and was the first animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and the film also received six Academy Award nominations, winning an award for ""Best Original Score"" and ""Best Original Song"".And to capitalize on the success of the film, Disney would release the two midquel's of the ""Beauty and the Beast"" trilogy: ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" (1997) and ""Belle's Magical World"" (1998).  The films would take place when Belle was being held inside the mansion of the beast and both trying to get to know each other.VIDEO:""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" is presented in 1080p High Definition Widescreen (1:78:1).  For a direct-to-video ""Beauty and the Beast"" midquel, the production was obviously higher budget with the use of CG.  Even the animation is much more fluid, colors are more vibrant, more detail and shadowing are utilized in ""The Enchanted Christmas"" and utilizes CG similar to the original animated film.I saw no artifacts, no white specks and scratches.  For the most part, picture quality is very good considering this is a direct-to-video release and it being released in 1997.  It's unfortunate that this quality didn't transfer over to the third film in the trilogy ""Belle's Magical World"".AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, 5.1 Dolby Digital French and Spanish language tracks.  Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.This film is primarily dialogue and musical driven and the audio comes clear through the center and front channels and music also is utilized through the surround channels.  There are some mild action sequences, especially towards the end of the film which does utilize the surround channels but for the most part, this is a dialogue and music driven soundtrack.Subtitle are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" comes with the following special features:Disney's Sing Me a Story With Belle: ""Stick To It (Don't Give Up)"" - (22:54) A hybrid live/animated short feature featuring a non-animated Belle with cuts of animated and puppet-based characters.  Belle inspires children to keep trying and never give up.Disney's Sing-Along-Mode - While watching the film, you can sing-along with the film (ala Karaoke style) during the musical portion of the film.Disney's Song Selection - Select you favorite song from the film to sing-along to.Behind the Scenes Featurette - (15:48) The making of ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"".  While watching the featurette,  when a Mickey symbol shows up during the featurette, it will show additional information about the film.Music Videos: ""As Long as There's Christmas"" - (3:20) Featuring a music video of ""As Long as There's Christmas"" by Play.Enchanted Environment - Bring the castle's crackling fireplace into your home.EXTRAS:""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" comes with a slipcover case plus a DVD presented in widecreen (1:78:1), 5.1 Dolby Digital English, French and Spanish with English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.JUDGMENT CALL:Enchanting and an entertaining continuation to the ""Beauty and the Beast"" animated film.  ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" is a wonderful family film for the holidays featuring the fun and vibrant characters of Disney's popular animated film.""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" is the midquel to the popular animated film and an answer to the many fans who have wanted to see Belle and the Beast once again!  It is no surprise that the film would receive a sequel or midquel as the original film literally made over $300 million in the box office, especially considering the original film only cost $25 million to make.  So, it was great to see ""The Enchanted Christmas"" made but also to incorporate the beautiful painted backgrounds, the vibrant colorful characters, wonderful animation including the CG animation that made the animated film so enjoyable, but incorporating it to the direct-to-video film.""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" is a holiday film that brings the cast back together again and one of the enjoyable moments of this film is that we get to see how happy everyone as humans (post-spell) and seeing how Belle and the Prince are so happy together, but also a story that shows what happened during the Holidays when Belle was still being held captive inside the castle and seeing how she was able to bring Christmas back into the castle despite the Beast being against it (as he was turned into a beast on Christmas day).A big question is if one should upgrade from DVD to Blu-ray.  I would say yes, only if you are a big fan of the film.  The Blu-ray definitely brings out the colors of the animated film, especially the detail.  Everything looks much more clearer and the banding issues that were on the DVD aren't in the Blu-ray version.  The Blu-ray version of ""The Enchanted Christmas"" looks very good and to hear the soundtrack via lossless is also another plus.  If anything, the film looks and sounds great in HD and is definitely worth the upgrade.Overall, ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted"" Christmas is a wonderful holiday film for the entire family.  And because it comes with both a Blu-ray and DVD, parents or grandparents can definitely benefit from watching this film via a long holiday commute or keeping the young one's occupied during the Winter break.But if you are a ""Beauty and the Beast"" fan and looking for an enjoyable family Holiday film, ""The Enchanted Christmas"" is for you!",4,"Blu-ray: If you loved the first film, you will

426533,AA5XZVANDXGJE,6304501153,"""dvdcollector18""","[19, 25]","Compared to today's Direct To Video Disney, this 1997 ""sequel"" to Beauty and the Beast seems very high quality. The animation does not match the original, no DTV ever will, but luckily it lacks a lot of that flat feel that plagues many Direct To Video productions today. Perhaps because the colors are darker. The only problem is the lack of detail in the backgrounds at times, it's too simplistic. And the characters sometimes are very flat, with no depth like the original classic.All the original voices return from the original (except Chip), which gives it good continuity. Tim Curry is excellent as the villain Forte. The songs are strong enough, better than anything I've heard in most of the other DTV's from Disney.Now, to the big problem. Despite the entire movie taking place in two days, it's very hard to swallow that this entire new story took place within the first film. There was not enough time in the first film for this ""lost chapter"" to have taken place. Continuity errors arise when the Beast imprisons Belle for trying to escape (she was going to cut down a Christmas tree) after giving her word that she wouldn't leave. Problem is that Belle already fled once before in the original, when the Beast rescued her from wolves. And after that incident, the Beast and Belle began to get closer almost immediatley.Even worse, it turns out (unless Belle and Beast wore the same outfits twice) that the ball room sequence in the original occurred during their Christmas celebration. C'mon, it was obvious that it was not Christmas during the original. It was winter yeah, but Christmas was the last thing on anybodies mind during the incidents that occurred in the original. Oh, and also the Beast hates Christmas becuase it turns out that he was turned into a Beast on the holiday. (Guess the narrator forgot to mention that in the original, didn't he?)As far as trying to make this story fit within the original, I think a below average job was done. So why four stars? Because even though this does not hold a candle to the original, it is still a very good holiday movie, on it's own, for children. This is much better then those annual Mickey Mouse and Winnie The Pooh Christmas movies that Disney puts out, and I can gaurantee that parents will have an easier time sitting through this movie than those.It is also vastly superior in terms of quality when compared to recent Disney sequels, just compare this to ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame II"" and you'll see what I mean.

The first Disney film ever to released on Platinum Edition DVD, that movie had a powerful and compelling story with a cast and musical numbers to match.Set in the Beast's castle, back before the spell was broken, comes ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas."" Mrs. Potts takes readers back to this tale which begins on Christmas Eve. Christmas is coming and Belle couldn't be more excited. Little Chip is excited to hear the news of Christmas too, but when Belle starts planning a celebration, she's stopped in her tracks. It seems ""the Master,"" Beast, has forbidden Christmas and the servants don't want to go along with her plan. Belle convinces them otherwise and even when the Beast rebels, she still goes ahead.""Beauty and the Beast"" is hard act to live up to and while this film isn't quite up to the same standard, it is still another great story and one I enjoyed watching. The original ""Beauty and the Beast"" featured a terrible villain, Gaston, and this film has one to match --- one that is perhaps even more terrifying. Forte was the musician in the castle and when the spell was placed on the castle, he was turned into a pipe organ. He now feels useful because his gloomy music seems to be the only thing that makes the Beast forget his hardships. So when he notices what's happening with Belle, he wants to put a stop to it and uses a little flute named Fife as his lackey. At first, Forte is a bit of a sympathetic character, for it's not hard not to sympathize with his worries of loneliness should the spell be broken. But when it seems like things are not going his way, Forte becomes truly horrifying.As with ""Beauty and the Beast,"" whose most memorable song matched its title, this film also has one song that stands out in particular --- ""As Long As There's Christmas.""As long as there's Christmas, I truly believe / That hope is the greatest / Of the gifts we'll receive.By the time you get done watching this video, you will have heard it four times --- twice sung by characters during the film and once during the closing credits, performed by Peabo Bryson (""Aladdin"") and Roberta Flack. There is one final performance --- see below.This special edition video release is close-captioned, recorded in SP mode and Hi-Fi stereo. Before the film starts, there are previews for other film, video and DVD releases, including Miramax's ""Pinocchio"" and Disney's ""Lilo and Stitch"" (which has been out for sometime now.) After the film, stay tuned for one more rendition of ""As Long As There's Christmas,"" a pop version performed by PLAY.This is a film worth adding to lineup of holiday specials.

Much of this is brought on by the fact that this movie has a central, ominous villain, whereas the original did not. Also, given where this story takes place in the original's timeline, the Beast is still mean, coarse and unrefined, prone to a lot of yelling and destruction. On top of that, the villainous Fort&eacute; sings a song that very clearly and deliberately contains the word ""hell."" How that made it into a G-rated movie is beyond me.The movie itself isn't as bad as one might expect for a straight-to-video sequel. It also doesn't have a lot to do with Christmas other than it happens to take place on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The holiday basically serves as a plot device to allow the Beast to thaw a little. As a movie, it's pretty decent, but as a holiday movie, it's not so good. Can you think of a better way to celebrate such a heartwarming holiday than with a movie containing an explosive, abusive Beast and a song that screams the word ""hell?""The special features of the DVD are so-so, but credit goes to Disney for doing something other than releasing a bare-bones disc. The behind-the-scenes featurette isn't really behind-the-scenes of THIS movie, as much as it is the B&B; series and animation in general, but it's informative on a surface level. The memory game is kind of difficult at first, but since it doesn't change, you'll never visit it again once you master it. The Enchanted Environments are an interesting addition as they are simply mock fireplaces. Also included is a sing-along feature that puts the words on the screen as the songs appear in the movie, as well as stand-alone sing-along selections. These nifty features allow your children to read profanity as well as sing along. As an unlisted feature, I suppose you could program your multi-disc player to insert the chapters of this movie into the appropriate place in the original for an extended viewing experience.If we had seen this movie before purchasing it for our four year-old daughter, we probably wouldn't have bought it.

I must admit that the picture quality is terrible on the original VHS and even earlier and current DVD versions. But once you see in on Blu-ray, the animation is so crystal clear that it looks new again and literally shines on your big screen compared to the major grain on the other releases in the past. While the animation is not up to par with the original, and some of the characters movements are robotic at times, high definition sure does a damn good job of bringing it close. Don't go into this movie expecting the same standard as the original because there won't be. For what it is, it's above average.The songs of course are great. Loved that the whole original voice cast came back. People are complaining that this movie scared their children, especially the villain Forte. Honestly, I saw this movie for the first time when I was seven years old in 1997 and I was not all scared but entranced. Really though, it can't all be candy canes and lollipops just because it says Christmas in the title. This isn't Tinker Bell and the Magical Christmas Tree. This is one of the very few Disney sequels that I actually enjoy (next to the Lion King 2: Simba's Pride) and not despise like so many others (the Hunchback of Notre Dame II... need I say more? Now lets never speak of it again).If you want a great holiday movie for your kids, or for the kid at heart, than pick this up! However, I would highly recommend seeing it on Blu-ray as the other qualities pretty much suck, but still worth it I suppose given that it's a great ""midquel"" to the BATB franchise.

However, ""Beauty & The Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"", along with ""Winnie The Pooh's Grandest Adventure"" is one of those straight to video sequels where Disney did put some effort in. Granted, certain continuity as with Belle's dress is partly stretched, but this sequel isn't at all bad. The animation is inferior to ""Beauty & The Beast"" but is superior to other Disney video sequels. It also has great music and is full of Christmas spirit.However, as with my review of ""Beauty & The Beast"", I'm gonna focus on the special features and the DVD itself. First of all, the film is digitally remastered and looks fantastic. As for the special features, ""Beauty & The Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" has ""Forte's Challenge"" game; an Enchanted environment fireplace; Sing-along song tracks; and a music video by Play. There is also an exciting behind the scenes documentary which I was very impressed by. With this documentary, whenever a bright circle appears on screen, if you press play, the documentary will go into greater depth before returning to where it left off. The documentary is also designed with Children in mind and thus is a lot of fun as well as being informative.

As a way to show her appreciation, Belle decides that the castle will celebrate Christmas, even though the Beast has forbidden it.  Surely it will bring hope and joy back to everyone in the castle, right?But Forte, the former court composer, is against the idea.  The current pipe organ has become used to being the Beast's confidant and advisor and is threatened by the idea of Beast falling in love and the spell being broken.  Enlisting the aid of Fife, he tries everything he can think of to ruin Christmas and drive Belle and the Beast further apart.Overall, I'm not too impressed with most of the Disney straight to video sequels.  But this one is entertaining.  The storyline is engaging, even if the ending is obvious from the start.  The idea of setting the ""sequel"" in the middle of the original movie is wonderful, and helps develop all the characters.  Yet the wrap around part shows us the human characters again and how things have changed.  All the original voices are back, except for Bradley Pierce as Chip, who is replaced by Haley Joel Osment.  In an effort to appeal to kids, the main target for this movie, Chip has a larger role in this one, but it really helps advance the story as well.As with most Disney animated sequels there are two major flaws.  The animation isn't as good as the original, although it certainly works to tell the story.  Also, with the exception of ""As Long As There's Christmas,"" the songs are immediately forgettable and actually take away from the enjoyment of the movie.  Also, clocking in at just over an hour, it's pretty short.The picture and sound on this DVD are fantastic.  For a special edition, this DVD is short on extras, but the number they have are fitting the movie.  There is an interesting making of documentary, but the rest of the features are for kids to enjoy.If you go into this movie not expecting the brilliance of the original, you'll be entertained.

The movie was originally supposed to be a direct to video sequel with Avenant, as Gaston's younger brother, seeking out revenge on Belle and the Prince. That ideal was scrap and the film became a midquel. The film picks up where the Beast has just recued Belle from the wolves in the original Beauty and The Beast.Belle wants to celebrate Christmas, but the Beast has strictly forbidden Christmas in the castle because that was the day the he was turned into a Beast. The new villain this time around is Forte. Forte was the Prince's chief conductor of music at the castle and was transformed into a pipe organ. Unlike the other resident of the castle, he is please with his transformation believing that he has more power now. Forte does not want the Beast to fall in love with Belle and will do anything to stop it. In the end Forte is destroyed by the Beast and if you saw the original movie, then you now how the story ended and that is basically the movie for you in those few sentences. Besides Forte; Angelique, Fife, and Axe are the new characters in this movie. Also in this movie the Beast does not have as many lines as he did in the original movie.In the end I thought there were too many musical numbers that could have been left out of the movie and the movie itself was too predictable. I am a big fan of if ain't broke then don't fix it. Die hard Beauty and the Beast fans may want to but this movie.

Beauty and the Beast is my favorite Disney movie, and I was not disappointed in this one. The story takes place before the beast is transformed at the end of the original movie, but begins during the first Christmas the couple (and their faithful staff) celebrate. Chips begs Mrs Potts to tell him a story, and thus The Enchanted Christmas. There is a villain, Forte, who tries to prevent Beast from growing closer to Belle, and he is pretty intense. Some younger viewers might find the facial expressions (he is the organ) and loud, dark music to be frightening. There's also a scene where two characters nearly drown.The plot moves along quickly, and even though you know what is going to happen, it won't matter one bit. Belle is sweet and strong-willed, Beast growls and is endearingly vulnerable, and Forte is one of Disney's best and darkest villains. There's humor, too, and a few jokes the adults will catch. The music is lovely and the singing is terrific and includes ""As Long As There's Christmas."" This appears to be a mix of CGI and traditional drawing. They work well together, though you can tell the difference. Not a bad thing. The colors are beautiful and are not washed out or pale.The original voice actors are featured, along with Tim Curry (who sounds like he a great deal of fun playing the villian Forte) and Bernadette Peters as Angelique. Everyone puts a great deal of effort into their characters and making them come to life. Among the bonuses is a very interesting behind the scenes look at how the video was made.A bit pricey, but for Beauty and the Beast fans, I highly recommend the splurge.",5,Lovely!

426566,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,6304501153,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[8, 9]","...Disney will keep rereleasing their movies in new format for more profits. Kidding aside, I bought this film on DVD years ago after it had already gone out of print. I sadly admit that I must have paid near $80 just for the nostalgic feeling of watching this again at Christmas. Was it worth the eigthy dollars? Probably not, but now people will be able to buy it for less than $30 and that is worth the price, especially in high definition.It doesn't have the animation quality that the big budget original had but they do the best they can with the budget they have and it will definitely be gleaming on Blu-ray. Some people say that the organ is too scary for kids, really? Is it the voice or what? I just don't see it. He is no scarier than the witch from Snow White, the Pleasure Island sequence from Pinochio, or even Gaston in the final scenes of the original. Parents all have to use their own discretion when allowing children to watch any film but I don't see how the villain here is any more frightening than those other acclaimed classics.The only downside with this release, not really any new special features. I would have loved a commentary or some new look back, even some classic disney holiday cartoons updated to high definition. I would have loved them but I can't say I expected them. Disney isn't as great at including new material as they have been in the past. There is the new inclusion of segments from the old Lynsey McLeod series Sing Me A Story with Belle, which will be nice to revisit but doesn't seem to tie into the holiday theme upon first inspection.I guess the fact that I'm now buying this to put it beside my Beauty and the Beast Blu-ray means I'll have spent over a hundred dollars on the film. It might not be worth it to most but I thoroughly enjoy this film and it's fun to find time to watch it every Christmas.I say 5 stars because I do love it, but let's be honest and say that if the original film is five stars this one is somewhere between three and four in reality. The production quality isn't as good, understandably, and the songs aren't as sweeping. The story is quaint, fun for the holidays and better than most Disney sequels but there was no way it could live up to the masterpiece of the original. That said, I love the film and I find it hard to believe anyone can honestly say this film negates the impact of the original (which is something that can be said of other Disney sequels). Now I'm just waiting on the separate release of Lion King 2 on Blu-ray and I'll have all the Disney sequels I ever need or want to own.(Correction: I may not mind purchasing the Aladdin sequels on Blu-ray someday but they feel more inclusive to the television series than the original film and as such I'd be more inclined to buy them in a series set.)***So having watched it the PQ is about what you'd expect. It isn't a diamond edition wow factor, but it looks crisp clean and like it was just animated, much better than my old DVD did. The special features are all standard definition, so the Sing me a Story segment (which is only good for kids or one nostalgic viewing) is a little hard to watch due to fuzziness. I wish they had made some new features but as a direct to video sequel I knew that wouldn't happen.I will say I'd only give this a 3.5 or 4 out of 5 for PQ overall though because the organ character, computer generated back in the late nineties, really shows a pixelated or digitized appearance. He clearly wasn't rendered in a high quality image and there was no way to change that now and it shows. I'm still happy I bought it, I love this film at Christmas and other than the pixelated digital organ, expected lower production values than the original that I was already aware of and no real new special features I thought it was great and worth the price after using the 5 dollar off coupon Disney is offering online.",5,As Long As There's Christmas...,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,3887,"['Disney', 'will', 'keep', 'rereleasing', 'movies', 'new', 'format', 'more', 'profits', 'Kidding', 'aside', 'bought', 'film', 'DVD', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'already', 'gone', 'print', 'sadly', 'admit', 'must', 'have', 'paid', '80', 'just', 'nostalgic', 'feeling', 'watching', 'again', 'Christmas', 'Was', 'eigthy', 'dollars', 'Probably', 'not', 'now', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'buy', 'less', '30', 'price', 'especially', 'high', 'definition.It', ""n't"", 'have', 'animation', 'quality', 'big', 'budget', 'original', 'had', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'budget', 'have', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'gleaming', 'Blu-ray', 'people', 'say', 'organ', 'too', 'scary', 'kids', 'really', 'voice', 'what', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'scarier', 'witch', 'Snow', 'White', 'Pleasure', 'Island', 'sequence', 'Pinochio', 'even', 'Gaston', 'final', 'scenes', 'original', 'Parents', 'have', 'use', 'own', 'discretion', 'when', 'allowing', 'children', 'watch', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'villain', 'here', 'more', 'frightening', 'other', 'acclaimed', 'classics.The', 'only', 'downside', 'release', 'not', 'really', 'new', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'commentary', 'new', 'look', 'back', 'even', 'classic', 'disney', 'holiday', 'cartoons', 'updated', 'high', 'definition', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'expected', 'Disney', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'including', 'new', 'material', 'have', 'been', 'past', 'new', 'inclusion', 'segments', 'old', 'Lynsey', 'McLeod', 'series', 'Sing', 'Me', 'A', 'Story', 'Belle', 'will', 'be', 'nice', 'revisit', ""n't"", 'seem', 'tie', 'holiday', 'theme', 'first', 'inspection.I', 'guess', 'fact', ""'m"", 'now', 'buying', 'put', 'beside', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Blu-ray', ""'ll"", 'have', 'spent', 'hundred', 'dollars', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'film', 'fun', 'find', 'time', 'watch', 'Christmas.I', 'say', '5', 'stars', 'do', 'love', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'original', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'one', 'somewhere', 'three', 'four', 'reality', 'production', 'quality', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'understandably', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'sweeping', 'story', 'quaint', 'fun', 'holidays', 'better', 'most', 'Disney', 'sequels', 'was', 'way', 'could', 'live', 'up', 'masterpiece', 'original', 'said', 'love', 'film', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'anyone', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'film', 'impact', 'original', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'Disney', 'sequels', 'Now', ""'m"", 'just', 'waiting', 'separate', 'release', 'Lion', 'King', '2', 'Blu-ray', ""'ll"", 'have', 'Disney', 'sequels', 'ever', 'need', 'want', 'own', 'Correction', 'may', 'not', 'mind', 'purchasing', 'Aladdin', 'sequels', 'Blu-ray', 'someday', 'feel', 'more', 'inclusive', 'television', 'series', 'original', 'film', 'such', ""'d"", 'be', 'more', 'inclined', 'buy', 'series', 'set', '***So', 'having', 'watched', 'PQ', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', ""n't"", 'diamond', 'edition', 'wow', 'factor', 'crisp', 'clean', 'was', 'just', 'animated', 'much', 'better', 'old', 'DVD', 'did', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'standard', 'definition', 'Sing', 'Story', 'segment', 'only', 'good', 'kids', 'one', 'nostalgic', 'viewing', 'little', 'hard', 'watch', 'due', 'fuzziness', 'wish', 'had', 'made', 'new', 'features', 'direct', 'video', 'sequel', 'knew', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen.I', 'will', 'say', ""'d"", 'only', 'give', '3.5', '4', '5', 'PQ', 'overall', 'organ', 'character', 'computer', 'generated', 'back', 'late', 'nineties', 'really', 'pixelated', 'digitized', 'appearance', 'clearly', 'was', ""n't"", 'rendered', 'high', 'quality', 'image', 'was', 'way', 'change', 'now', ""'m"", 'still', 'happy', 'bought', 'love', 'film', 'Christmas', 'other', 'pixelated', 'digital', 'organ', 'expected', 'lower', 'production', 'values', 'original', 'was', 'already', 'aware', 'real', 'new', 'special', 'features', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'worth', 'price', 'using', '5', 'dollar', 'coupon', 'Disney', 'offering', 'online']",Disney's Beauty and the Beast - The Enchanted Christmas VHS

426569,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,6304501153,Simon,"[0, 3]","Going by what other reviewers have already said, I bought this DVD as a gift for my brother and sister. Around mid-afternoon on Christmas day, we sat down to watch it. Considering that I'm a lot older than the target audience and a lot more cynical about Disney productions than I used to be, it's to the film's credit that I still enjoyed it. Not near the quality of the original, and not quite up to par with Disney's greatest direct-to-video release Aladdin and the King of Thieves, but still a nice little holiday movie.The movie has many high points. All of the original cast is back, except for Chip, but he's actually been replaced by Haley Joel Osment. This immediately gives this movie some credibility, as the voice actors are all top notch. Joining the cast is another great actor, Tim Curry as the villain Forte. Coupled with some delicious computer animation, Forte is a very worthy villain. He towers over everyone else, accomplishes much evil even though he is bolted to the wall, and is really creepy in human form. Unfortunately, he gets the one dull song in the movie, but thankfully, all the others are top-notch fun. And the animation in general is very good; a few characters look slightly off at times (Lumiere and Cogsworth in human form in the intro, for example), but overall everything has a very warm, rich feeling.So what are the movie's low points? The story itself doesn't disappoint, but it's nothing super special either. It won't match up to other holiday classsics like Garfield, Peanuts, Grinch, and Disney's own A Christmas Carol. And while almost everything fits within continuity with the original, it's best not to think about such things. Just because Belle wore her yellow dress to dance with the beast in the original, does it mean that was the only time she wore it? No, but using the dress again kinda tarnishes the magic of that moment in the ball room. The only glaring continuity error is at the movie's end. While the movie packs in some decent action (which I did not expect from a holiday movie), you'll find yourself wondering how everything was restored back to normal later. Other than this, I wish they had used that lovely feather duster character more instead of making her another background object. And lastly, the movie seems a little too dark at times. If your TV set is darker than normal, a lot of the fine details in the animation will be lost on you.But overall, Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas is worth owning. There's good acting and animation, and while the story isn't quite up there, it's worth a repeated viewing, and might in time join your family's lineup of traditional holiday movies.",3,"Hey, this isn't too bad!",1040774400,"12 25, 2002",2002,2672,"['Going', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'bought', 'DVD', 'gift', 'brother', 'sister', 'mid-afternoon', 'Christmas', 'day', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Considering', ""'m"", 'lot', 'older', 'target', 'audience', 'lot', 'more', 'cynical', 'Disney', 'productions', 'used', 'be', 'film', 'credit', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'Not', 'quality', 'original', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'Disney', 'greatest', 'direct-to-video', 'release', 'Aladdin', 'King', 'Thieves', 'still', 'nice', 'little', 'holiday', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'many', 'high', 'points', 'original', 'cast', 'back', 'Chip', 'actually', 'been', 'replaced', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'immediately', 'movie', 'credibility', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Joining', 'cast', 'great', 'actor', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'villain', 'Forte', 'Coupled', 'delicious', 'computer', 'animation', 'Forte', 'very', 'worthy', 'villain', 'everyone', 'else', 'accomplishes', 'much', 'evil', 'even', 'bolted', 'wall', 'really', 'creepy', 'human', 'form', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'dull', 'song', 'movie', 'thankfully', 'others', 'are', 'top-notch', 'fun', 'animation', 'general', 'very', 'good', 'few', 'characters', 'look', 'slightly', 'off', 'times', 'Lumiere', 'Cogsworth', 'human', 'form', 'intro', 'example', 'overall', 'everything', 'very', 'warm', 'rich', 'feeling.So', 'are', 'movie', 'low', 'points', 'story', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'nothing', 'super', 'special', 'wo', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'other', 'holiday', 'classsics', 'Garfield', 'Peanuts', 'Grinch', 'Disney', 'own', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'almost', 'everything', 'fits', 'continuity', 'original', 'best', 'not', 'think', 'such', 'things', 'Just', 'Belle', 'wore', 'yellow', 'dress', 'dance', 'beast', 'original', 'mean', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'wore', 'No', 'using', 'dress', 'again', 'kinda', 'tarnishes', 'magic', 'moment', 'ball', 'room', 'only', 'glaring', 'continuity', 'error', 'movie', 'end', 'movie', 'decent', 'action', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'holiday', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'find', 'wondering', 'how', 'everything', 'was', 'restored', 'back', 'normal', 'later', 'Other', 'wish', 'had', 'used', 'lovely', 'feather', 'duster', 'character', 'more', 'instead', 'making', 'background', 'object', 'lastly', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'dark', 'times', 'TV', 'set', 'darker', 'normal', 'lot', 'fine', 'details', 'animation', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'you.But', 'overall', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Enchanted', 'Christmas', 'worth', 'owning', 'good', 'acting', 'animation', 'story', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'might', 'time', 'join', 'family', 'lineup', 'traditional', 'holiday', 'movies']",Disney's Beauty and the Beast - The Enchanted Christmas VHS
