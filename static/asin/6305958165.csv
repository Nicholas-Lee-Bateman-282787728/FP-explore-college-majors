But I was wrong. It was very clever and Justin did a good job, even though the lead, Maggie Lawson, stole the show. Alex is a nerdy girl who dosen't have much confidence. People are really mean to her and she wants to be a fashion designer. Genine is a famous super model who everybody loves and adores. Alex and Genine look exactly alike and are both having problems with their lives. So when they meet, they decide to trade places. It all goes good at first. Alex in Genines place falls in love with model Jason Sharp(Timberlake). Genine in Alex's place falls in love with the school jock. But when Alex's kid brother stumbles on to their secret, they are forced to swittch back. Can they keep their loves?

Very interesting version of ""The Prince and the Pauper"", with a modern New York City twist. It's cool to see Janine and Alex try to live each other's lives, which produces very entertaining results. It's especially cool to see Justin Timberlake in there. I sure wish they had given him more screen time, but then again, he's not the central character.If you haven't seen this movie yet, I recommend that you do.

485015,A3U5JCXIXTGSLN,6305958165,musiclover13,"[0, 0]","Okay, I have to admit that I originally watched &quot;Model Behavior&quot; on television because I knew Justin Timberlake was going to be in it. From the first minute of the film, I realized that I should have just left the movie alone and watched something else.This movie revolves around the tale of The Prince and Pauper. There are two girls who magically are identical, but have never met one another or heard of the other. Somehow they encounter and switch lives for awhile. That would be all fine and good for a Disney movie, but then Kathie Lee Gifford and Justin Timberlake come into play.Even though I'm a fan of Timberlake's, I think his performance in this movie was terrible. Maybe it was because it was his first real role in a film, but all of his lines seemed stiff and forced. He came off like he was trying to &quot;act&quot; instead of just doing what came naturally. Watching him in his role as a supermodel who's infatuated with the female leads in the film became very painful after awhile. Kathie Lee Gifford's role suited her, but again, she seemed like she was forcing it too much.Overall, I guess this film could be okay for typical Disney audiences because it teaches you a good lesson at the end and everyone lives happily ever after.

At first when I saw the storyline of the movie I thought it was going to be another Parent Trap movie, but it was totally different. The story is this. It's about 2 girls one a super model and the other a typical high school girl who are complete strangers to one another, and then they bump into each other at a party. Both of the girls are tired with their own lives and so they decide to switch places. At first it seems like a good idea and things are going as planned, but soon everything goes wrong and the whole twin switch thing is a complete disaster. In the end the two girls reveal to their family and friends about their switch when they bump into each other at the dance and soon their lives and problems are mended and everyone lives happily ever after. This movie was a fun and heartfelt movie. Kathie Lee Gifford does a superb job as the overprotective and overbearing mother of her supermodel daughter.

The tale follows Alex Borroughs, (Maggie Lawson) a class geek trying to get up the nerve to ask out her crush and Jeanine Addams, (Lawson, again) a world famous super model launching a book and wishing she were  like everyone else. When the two bump into each other a a party Alex's father is catering, Jeanine has an idea: The girls look so much alike, they could switch place, in fact THEY DO switch places. Alex spends a week in the lap of luxury shopping and trying to be a model in NYC. (Even though she hates having her picture taken.) Meanwhile, Jeanine is enjoying the carefree teenage life, going on dates, hanging with Alex's friend and trying to be a student.  About mid-movie Jason Sharp( Teen heart-thob Justin Timberlake of *NSYNC) ask Alex (Who he thinks is Jeanine) on a date while back home Alex's crush asks Jeanine on a date with him. The problem? They all end up at the same restaurant, and Alex's pesky little brother follows Alex, believing correctly that she's not really Alex. There, Lawson and Lawson come face to face in the powder room and each switches again just for a moment to see how the other's date is going. Unfortunately kid brother Josh caught it all on tape and now has evidence enough to blackmail them both until eternity!Over a course of time Alex as Jeanine loses one of Jeanine's designers because she ruins a dress and Jeanine as Alex ends up grounded for forgetting a catering event with her father.

This movie would've been a whole heck of a lot better without him! Sorry, 'N Sync obsessive fans, but Justin can't act at all...much less sing (he's got a horrible, whiny voice) and he's ugly. And I just think the only reason he decided to do this movie was to up-grade the 'N Sync craze (I absolutely hate 'N Sync).MODEL BEHAVIOR is about these two look-alike but different teenage girls named Janie and Alex. Alex is your average every-day high school girl while Janie is a supermodel! The two of them meet at Alex's father's restuarant where Janie is holding a special appearence when they realize how much they look alike. To discover what the other's life is like, the two of them switch places and Janie pretends to be Alex while Alex pretends to be Janie. Things are going smoothly until the real Alex gets asked out by another supermodel, Jason (Justin Timberlake), because he thinks that she is Janie and Alex's high school crush, Josh, asks Janie out thinking that she is Alex! When it's time for Alex's school prom, things start to get even more messed up when Jason finds Janie talking to Josh even though she is really Alex!The movie also stars Maggie Lawson who plays a double-role as Alex and Janie and also co-stars Kathie Lee Gilford, who plays Janie's stage-mother, and Kathie Lee Gilford's real-life son, Cody Gilford, who plays Janie's bratty, stuck-up brother.Great, fun movie but could've been better without Justin Timberlake!
