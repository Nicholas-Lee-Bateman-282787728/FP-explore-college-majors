1515960,AYUO4QC08QQ4C,B006IW8EA2,"A. M. Steiner ""Huskarl1066""","[1, 2]","The Rape of Nanking is a brutal story by most any standards.  The Japanese are correctly portrayed as absolute monsters, as was their norm throughout this era.  Two Japanese junior officers were known in this battle to have lined up 100 men each (all in a row), and then proceeded to behead them in a contest to see which would get to the other end first. Rape and looting was commonplace, alongside the mass murder, and executions.  The movie effectively illustrates the events which took place in Nanking.  I most enjoyed the fact, that the small arms were correct for the Chinese and Japanese alike.  The Chinese infantry were eqipped with Mauser VZ 24's (which they had imported) along with the ZB 26 light machinegun from Czechoslovakia.  I was also delighted to see the Japanese 6.5mm Type 11 light machinegun in use as well.  The fact that the director went to the trouble to make details like these weapons, and the grenades proper for each army speaks volumes, as opposed to an old John Wayne film like ""The Flying Tigers"" where a P-40b Tomahawk banks, and there is no wing.

Bale's character finds himself at first hiding in an orphanage, then taking on the role of saviour to the children.

I have read a few historical accounts of this terrible event but have never seen it fictionalized so I was worried that it might dilute the horrors or come across as melodramatic.

1515975,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B006IW8EA2,C. Sawin,"[10, 15]","I'm really weird when it comes to war films. I have a fascination with both horror and extremely violent films in general, but tend to mostly not care for films that revolve around war. It's not that they're bad or unwatchable, but none of them have ever really made me think they're worth owning or watching again. Chinese and Japanese war epics seem to be a bit different as I adore films like The Last Samurai, Mongol, and The Warlords. The Flowers of War is in a similar vein as those three films yet is also incredibly different in comparison.Yimou Zhang is a director that's pretty much made a name for himself as a director with his incredible use of color. Hero, House of Flying Daggers, and Curse of the Golden Flower are all lush, vibrant, and just visually brilliant. The Flowers of War is almost completely devoid of color. The battlefield is littered with shades of brown and gray until someone is shot and blood sprays into the air or trickles to the ground. The only real use of color comes in the form of the round stained glass window and the elaborate dresses the prostitutes wear. This adds for some incredible and dynamic shots seeing warfare on their doorstep through a multicolored filter and broken glass. Two prostitutes eventually escape with the intent of returning, but there's this amazing one-take sequence of their attempt of coming back to the church and their colorful dresses play a big part. That scene along with a few others was slightly reminiscent of Children of Men.The evolution of John Miller (Christian Bale) is something wonderful. When he first arrives to the church, he's money hungry, a drunk, and a womanizer. But being around the students at the church and the group of prostitutes brings out the best in him. That sounds awkward, but it makes sense after seeing the film. There are a few wandering shots that show Bale standing or sitting alone in the church. They're fairly brief, but those images stick with you. The Chinese soldier that drops off Pu Sheng and returns one of the student's shoes is one to keep an eye on, as well. Without spoiling too much, his strategy is nothing short of amazing.As you can probably imagine, The Flowers of War does touch upon some extremely vicious and barbaric acts that are difficult to watch. It is based on the Rape of Nanking after all. The sequences of violence are necessary, but aren't for those of you with weak stomachs. Children are stabbed and shot while prostitutes are raped and brutally murdered. Then there's all the bloodshed from the war going on. It's pretty intense, but the message the film offers makes it all worth it.The Flowers of War is almost a war masterpiece, but there are several things that stand in the way of making it just that. The main one being that nearly every female character in the film will irritate the holy hell out of you for the entire two hour and twenty minute duration. Every prostitute but Mo (Ni Ni) has a voice that's the equivalent of scraping fingernails against a chalkboard, but there's a group of them so multiply that by twelve. Not only that, but they make stupid decisions. Risking your life for a cat or strings for your instrument seems kind of fruitless at this point, wouldn't you say? Then there's the group of students at the church that do nothing but cry, be spiteful towards the prostitutes, and hold grudges. Were they imperative to the story? Of course, but their stupid actions will only help you cheer for their deaths at the same time. There are also two musical numbers that feel out of place. Both are great concepts on paper, but they feel clumsy in their execution. And to be honest, I'm just glad the phrase, ""No Mo,"" wasn't uttered at all in the film.Despite featuring some of the most annoying and idiotic female characters of recent memory, The Flowers of War is an emotional journey with a heartfelt message. As John comes clean about a lie he told Mo earlier on in the film, Mo replies, ""Sometimes the truth is the last thing we need to hear."" That quote fits so perfectly with the tone of the film. Christian Bale delivers a spectacular performance as watching the evolution of John Miller through the duration of the film is nearly as great as the maneuver they pull off. Often brutal yet frequently beautiful, The Flowers of War is one of the few war films that is not only thoroughly enjoyable but is capable of maturing into one of the most selfless acts imaginable.",4,"""Sometimes the truth is the last thing we need to hear.""",1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,4445,"[""'m"", 'really', 'weird', 'when', 'war', 'films', 'have', 'fascination', 'horror', 'extremely', 'violent', 'films', 'general', 'tend', 'mostly', 'not', 'care', 'films', 'revolve', 'war', 'not', ""'re"", 'bad', 'unwatchable', 'none', 'have', 'ever', 'really', 'made', 'think', ""'re"", 'worth', 'owning', 'watching', 'again', 'Chinese', 'Japanese', 'war', 'epics', 'seem', 'be', 'bit', 'different', 'adore', 'films', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'Mongol', 'Warlords', 'Flowers', 'War', 'similar', 'vein', 'three', 'films', 'yet', 'also', 'incredibly', 'different', 'comparison.Yimou', 'Zhang', 'director', 'pretty', 'much', 'made', 'name', 'director', 'incredible', 'use', 'color', 'Hero', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower', 'are', 'lush', 'vibrant', 'just', 'visually', 'brilliant', 'Flowers', 'War', 'almost', 'completely', 'devoid', 'color', 'battlefield', 'littered', 'shades', 'brown', 'gray', 'someone', 'shot', 'blood', 'sprays', 'air', 'trickles', 'ground', 'only', 'real', 'use', 'color', 'form', 'round', 'stained', 'glass', 'window', 'elaborate', 'prostitutes', 'wear', 'incredible', 'dynamic', 'shots', 'seeing', 'warfare', 'doorstep', 'multicolored', 'filter', 'broken', 'glass', 'Two', 'prostitutes', 'eventually', 'escape', 'intent', 'returning', 'amazing', 'one-take', 'sequence', 'attempt', 'coming', 'back', 'church', 'colorful', 'dresses', 'play', 'big', 'part', 'scene', 'few', 'others', 'was', 'slightly', 'reminiscent', 'Children', 'Men.The', 'evolution', 'John', 'Miller', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'something', 'wonderful', 'When', 'first', 'church', 'money', 'hungry', 'drunk', 'womanizer', 'being', 'students', 'church', 'group', 'prostitutes', 'brings', 'out', 'best', 'awkward', 'sense', 'seeing', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'wandering', 'shots', 'show', 'Bale', 'standing', 'sitting', 'alone', 'church', ""'re"", 'fairly', 'brief', 'images', 'stick', 'Chinese', 'soldier', 'Pu', 'Sheng', 'one', 'student', 'shoes', 'one', 'keep', 'eye', 'well', 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', 'strategy', 'nothing', 'short', 'can', 'probably', 'imagine', 'Flowers', 'War', 'touch', 'extremely', 'vicious', 'barbaric', 'acts', 'are', 'difficult', 'watch', 'based', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'sequences', 'violence', 'are', 'necessary', 'are', ""n't"", 'weak', 'stomachs', 'Children', 'are', 'stabbed', 'shot', 'prostitutes', 'are', 'raped', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'Then', 'bloodshed', 'war', 'going', 'pretty', 'intense', 'message', 'film', 'offers', 'it.The', 'Flowers', 'War', 'almost', 'war', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'stand', 'way', 'making', 'just', 'main', 'one', 'being', 'nearly', 'female', 'character', 'film', 'will', 'irritate', 'holy', 'hell', 'entire', 'two', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minute', 'duration', 'Every', 'prostitute', 'Mo', 'Ni', 'Ni', 'voice', 'equivalent', 'scraping', 'fingernails', 'chalkboard', 'group', 'so', 'multiply', 'twelve', 'Not', 'only', 'make', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'Risking', 'life', 'cat', 'strings', 'instrument', 'kind', 'fruitless', 'point', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'Then', 'group', 'students', 'church', 'do', 'nothing', 'cry', 'be', 'spiteful', 'prostitutes', 'hold', 'grudges', 'Were', 'imperative', 'story', 'course', 'stupid', 'actions', 'will', 'only', 'help', 'cheer', 'deaths', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'musical', 'numbers', 'feel', 'place', 'are', 'great', 'concepts', 'paper', 'feel', 'clumsy', 'execution', 'be', 'honest', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'phrase', 'Mo', 'was', ""n't"", 'uttered', 'film.Despite', 'featuring', 'most', 'annoying', 'idiotic', 'female', 'characters', 'recent', 'memory', 'Flowers', 'War', 'emotional', 'journey', 'heartfelt', 'message', 'John', 'clean', 'lie', 'told', 'Mo', 'earlier', 'film', 'Mo', 'Sometimes', 'truth', 'last', 'thing', 'need', 'hear', 'quote', 'fits', 'so', 'perfectly', 'tone', 'film', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'watching', 'evolution', 'John', 'Miller', 'duration', 'film', 'nearly', 'as', 'great', 'maneuver', 'pull', 'off', 'Often', 'brutal', 'yet', 'frequently', 'beautiful', 'Flowers', 'War', 'one', 'few', 'war', 'films', 'not', 'only', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'capable', 'maturing', 'one', 'most', 'selfless', 'acts', 'imaginable']",The Flowers of War

Long, graphically realistic scenes of war violence and carnage, as well as the numerous rapes which often ended in murder. Though the transformation in his character from totally selfish to completely selfless is a little sudden, Christian Bale gives a strong performance as John Miller. Virtually all of the Chinese ladies--both the courtesans and the Winchester Cathedral girls--are similarly well-portrayed. The beautifully peaceful singing by the choir girls provides a believable contrast to the horrors going on all around them. Special mention should also be given to Dawei Tong as Major Li.While THE FLOWERS of WAR places no blankets over the brutality of this event, it also shows both sides of the Japanese coin. Even at their most barbaric, the marauding soldiers still come across as eminently human. Humans, of course, can be pretty terrible, but regardless, I know of very few western films that succeed so well in portraying the WWII-era Japanese as something other than just faceless, sinister, bestial monsters.

1515985,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B006IW8EA2,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","Director Zhang Yimou set out to produce a world-class epic appealing to audiences outside China. His setting is the aftermath of the 1937 Battle of Nanking, as victorious Japanese troops pillaged the city and brutalized Chinese civilians. At a walled Catholic cathedral, a diverse group of survivors seek shelter. They include a troop of young female Chinese convent students, shepherded through the dangerous streets by a brave young boy. They are joined by a hard-drinking American mortician named John Miller, who finds his way through the rubble to bury the former resident priest. Lastly, a dozen attractive Chinese courtesans force their way into the compound, and take over the cellar. The refugees are overwatched, at least for a time, by a handful of Chinese soldiers.Inside the church, the unhappy refugees must rely upon each other for survival. A drunken John Miller, swapping his filthy clothing for the dead priest's clean robes, finds himself posing as the priest to stave off a squad of Japanese soldiers bent on rape, then negotiating with a Japanese officer for the safety of the schoolgirls. At the charming behest of Yi Mou, the leader of the prostitutes, Miller attempts to repair an ancient truck for a possible getaway. However, a ultimatum to turn the young girls over to the Japanese Army forces hard choices and a desperate plan for escape...&#34;The Flowers of War&#34; is a superbly executed movie experience, including a suspenseful story with a narrowing pathway to redemption, magnificent cinematography, and a cast you can't take your eyes off of. It is no knock on Christian Bale that his moving performance as John Miller is in support of the Chinese actors, from the young convent girls who struggle to understand the terrifying chaos around them, to the last acts of heroism of the Chinese soldiers, to the prostitutes who find a reason to make an unthinkable sacrifice.&#34;The Flowers of War&#34; won't be everyone's cup of tea. Much of the dialogue is in Chinese, supported by sub-titles. Several scenes are disturbingly brutal, although consistent with the historical record. The director chose to withhold information about the two main characters until late in the movie, making their personal transformations initially hard to credit. Not every viewer will like the voiceover by one of the young convent students. However, viewers with the patience to absorb a long movie are likely to have a richly rewarding entertainment experience.

1515988,AYG1U47VFZ165,B006IW8EA2,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[4, 6]","This is one I've got to be as upfront as possible about: stories dealing with the atrocities involved in the brief Japanese invasion of Nanking (China) are NOT for everyone.  If you're unsure of the incident long referred to as `the Rape of Nanking,' then I'd encourage you to Google it, investigate in on your own before jumping headfirst into Yimou Zhang's THE FLOWERS OF WAR; familiarize yourself with one of history's darkest hours in order to get a basic foundation for this story, which (as I understand) is only based on real events.In 1937 - not long after aligning with Hitler's Germany - Japan invaded China, and the city of Nanking was under siege for several days.  Violence took the shape of unending bloodshed.  Into this fray wandered John Miller (played by Christian Bale), an American trapped behind enemy lines.  As a mortician, Miller was sent to embalm a deceased Catholic priest; now running for his life, he takes refuge in the church, declared `sacred territory' by both the fighting Japanese and Chinese soldiers.  Inside, he finds a group of innocent schoolgirls as well as thirteen beautiful courtesans also secreted away from the horrors outside.  In order to save them, Miller assumes the identity of a priest and demands his cathedral be respected as a sanctuary.It's an immensely moving performance by Bale that elevates FLOWERS.  At first, Miller appears little more than a jaded opportunist.  At every turn, he demands payment for his services to the Church, despite the fact that the survivors no longer have a body needing embalming (it was destroyed in the city's bombing campaign).  After he learns that the church's steward has no money available, he seeks to raid its wine cellar as compensation.  When the courtesans seek his aid in getting out of the city, he demands sexual favors in return.  However, as the story unfolds, we realize he's perhaps as battered and broken as the residents of Nanking; his behavior is the result of burying his young daughter several years before.  It's precisely the kind of role that Humphrey Bogart would've put on the map decades earlier, reminiscent of the irascible boat captain from THE AFRICAN QUEEN, but set against a much more horrific backdrop.  In fact, the only problem I had whatsoever with Bale's performance is that he delivers much of his early dialogue somewhat gutturally, making it hard to understand what he was saying.This isn't to dismiss the other performances.  Ni Ni, in her feature film debut, shines as the head courtesan, Yu Mo, deftly navigates the layers of her delicate womanhood, at times tortured by the choices of her life while other times a confident seductress.  Zhang Xinyi also delivers an exceptional performance as the lead schoolgirl whose father long ago promised to deliver her and her classmates from the impending invasion; once he forsakes them, she finds herself at odds with the students and even the courtesans whose `lack of morals' she protests.At all times, FLOWERS balances the various plotlines, all of them revolving around the themes of sacrifice and honor amongst these characters that have chosen, for better or worse, to make their last stand against insurmountable odds.  There's always the threat of unanticipated, unpredictable violence, so the tension remains high consistently.  Director Yimou Zhang - who brought us the equally brilliant HERO (with Jet Li) and THE HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS - masterfully navigates these lives with some unforgettable cinematography that's equally breathtaking and heartbreaking.  This is the kind of picture where you know that not everyone is going to make it out alive; the true balancing act here maintaining the tension and just enough ambiguity so that the audience can't effectively predict what's coming ... and, on that front, Zhang succeeds brilliantly.  What emerges is a stirring film that deserves as wide an audience as possible.THE FLOWERS OF WAR was produced by Beijing New Picture Film Company, EDKO Film, and New Picture Company.  DVD distribution stateside is being handled by Lionsgate.  The sound and picture are phenomenal - the film has some exceptional photography of the war-torn streets of Nanking - with the only exception being whoever miked Bale's spoken words.  As for special features, there is a five-part documentary `making of,' but I haven't watched it yet.  I would've liked more - at least a commentary track from such an effective picture - but I guess that wasn't meant to be.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  Like SCHINDLER'S LIST, THE FLOWERS OF WAR is a film that broaches a very difficult subject matter - the horrible, horrific reality of service and sacrifice in war-time atrocities.  Under Zhang's direction, the topic is made entirely relatable by way of a very personal and surprisingly uplifting story.  It's a film unmistakably about survival when up against the most formidable odds, and Bale's performance - while a bit off-putting vocally - is a centerpiece worth celebrating.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at Lionsgate provided me with a DVD screener copy of THE FLOWERS OF WAR by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",5,Grim

The horrors depicted certainly ring true.If anything, one could argue that the horrors are a little too mild compared to the eyewitness accounts, but that's always the challenge when making films about atrocities like this or the Holocaust in Europe.  On the one hand you want your audience to truly understand something of the horror; on the other hand you don't want to send them fleeing the theater, puking their guts out.  IMHO director Zhang Yimou has performed a good balancing act here.  While the horror that was the Rape of Nanking is clearly depicted, it is done in small pieces so as not to overwhelm and crush.  The one thing I found a bit disturbing is that, per his reputation, director Zhang Yimou in several places produces images of striking beauty amidst horrific events.  I found them a bit creepy if certainly beautiful.Note: It is worth watching the special features, which consist of a series of short documentaries about the making of the film.  I found them more interesting than most because they revealed the director's somewhat unusual approach to directing very well.  Perhaps because so much of the cast consisted of very young actresses, in many cases making their first film or certainly their biggest film or perhaps because this is how he always works, the director was strikingly humble and encouraging in his words and manner but VERY meticulous.  I never heard him speak a harsh or non-encouraging word but he kept his people doing the scene over and over until he was satisfied.  I don't think director Zhang Yimou has ever broken an actor's confidence or hurt an actress' feelings,...but he might have gently worked a few to death!",5,Chillingly Beautiful,1343520000,"07 29, 2012",2012,2077,"['Adapted', 'apparently', 'changed', 'considerably', 'Geiling', ""Yan'snovel"", 'unclear', 'events', 'depicted', 'here', 'really', 'happened', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'having', 'read', 'subject', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'Forgotten', 'Holocaust', 'World', 'War', 'IIandThe', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'Undeniable', 'History', 'Photographs', 'can', 'say', 'nothing', 'depicted', 'here', 'rings', 'false', 'compared', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'horrors', 'depicted', 'certainly', 'ring', 'true.If', 'anything', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'horrors', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'mild', 'compared', 'eyewitness', 'accounts', 'always', 'challenge', 'when', 'making', 'films', 'atrocities', 'Holocaust', 'Europe', 'one', 'hand', 'want', 'audience', 'truly', 'understand', 'something', 'horror', 'other', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'send', 'fleeing', 'theater', 'puking', 'guts', 'out', 'IMHO', 'director', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'performed', 'good', 'balancing', 'act', 'here', 'horror', 'was', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'clearly', 'depicted', 'done', 'small', 'pieces', 'so', 'not', 'overwhelm', 'crush', 'one', 'thing', 'found', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'reputation', 'director', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'several', 'places', 'images', 'striking', 'beauty', 'amidst', 'horrific', 'events', 'found', 'bit', 'creepy', 'certainly', 'beautiful.Note', 'worth', 'watching', 'special', 'features', 'consist', 'series', 'short', 'documentaries', 'making', 'film', 'found', 'more', 'interesting', 'most', 'revealed', 'director', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'approach', 'directing', 'very', 'well', 'Perhaps', 'so', 'much', 'cast', 'consisted', 'very', 'young', 'actresses', 'many', 'cases', 'making', 'first', 'film', 'certainly', 'biggest', 'film', 'perhaps', 'how', 'always', 'director', 'was', 'strikingly', 'humble', 'encouraging', 'words', 'manner', 'VERY', 'meticulous', 'never', 'heard', 'speak', 'harsh', 'non-encouraging', 'word', 'kept', 'people', 'doing', 'scene', 'over', 'was', 'satisfied', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'director', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'ever', 'broken', 'actor', 'confidence', 'hurt', 'actress', 'feelings', 'might', 'have', 'gently', 'worked', 'few', 'death']",The Flowers of War

1515995,A328S9RN3U5M68,B006IW8EA2,Grady Harp,"[12, 14]","The gruesome realities of the Japanese invasion and conquering of the city of Nanking, China in 1937 have been brought to the screen on a regular basis: In The Name of the Emperor form Christine Choi and Nancy Tang in 1998, Nanking form Bill Gutentag and Dan Sturman in 2007, City of Life and Death form Chuan Lee in 2009 and John Rabe from Florian Gallenburger in 2009, and now come THE FLOWERS OF WAR from Yimou Zhang in 2011.  Though the story is based on facts, the various movie versions vary considerably on what really happened.  THE FLOWERS OF WAR is based on Geling Yan's novel `13 Flowers of Nanjing,' the story gathers an improbable collection of people -- Bale's freelance American mortician, a group of convent schoolgirls and the women from a local brothel -- in the nominal refuge of a Catholic cathedral as the capital falls to Japan's Imperial Army. There are so many sidebar stories and characters introduced that the enormous impact the other films created is somewhat diluted here despite some quality direction from Yimou Zhang.  As the LA Times critic stated, `The Flowers of War has broken new ground for China's movie industry: It's among the first domestically financed films to star a high-profile Hollywood actor (Christian Bale), and its reported budget of close to $100 million makes it the country's priciest production to date. But when it comes to storytelling, Zhang Yimou's 19th feature is decidedly backward-looking: A lavish period weepie set against the atrocities of the Nanking Massacre, ""Flowers"" abounds with well-worn movie archetypes and slathers on schmaltz.'Briefly stated, in 1937 China, during the second Sino-Japanese war, a mortician, John (Christian Bale) arrives at a Catholic church in Nanjing to prepare a priest for burial. Upon arrival he finds himself the lone adult among a group of convent girl students and prostitutes from a nearby brothel. When he finds himself in the unwanted position of protector of both groups from the horrors of the invading Japanese army, he discovers the meaning of sacrifice and honor. Innocence-vs. -experience is an undeniably strong theme. The girls' tender adolescence heightens its impact, especially given the historical facts. The Nanking Massacre is also known as the Rape of Nanking, and it's more than a figurative description: The Japanese invaders committed horrendous sexual assaults against the female population. In ""Flowers,"" the girls' safety becomes the paramount concern of the survivors holed up in the cathedral.Christian Bale seems to struggle with this character and his performance is not particularly convincing or moving.  The aspect of this film that overcomes the over-production qualities (hiring Joshua Bell to provide a violin solo seems a bit much, etc) is the story itself, a bit of history that cannot be replayed often enough to again remind us how war alters man - and that survival, no matter the method, is the laudatory aspect of human caring.

Unfortunately memories are short in that regard. But, there are the acts of compassion and one of the most interesting during the Nanking (Nanjing) rapes and massacres were the people who, at personal risk, created safety zones within the city. Ironically, the person who provided sanctuary for the greatest number of Nanking civilians was a German businessman and Nazi, John Rabe. In further irony he was later forced into poverty by the Allies, but then later rescued and honored by the city of Nanking.Several movies, ""Black Sun"", ""City of Life & Death"", ""John Rabe"", ""The Children of Huang Shi"" have been made of this event and the subject makes it a challenge to not do it justice. Bale (why he chose to act in this film given his schedule, distance & language challenges) contributed in many ways, besides his acting, towards its success. Not the least of which was making all of those around him feel comfortable despite his superstar status.

What makes this film so dramatic is that it fashions a gripping and credible story out of the actions of an unlikely hero who steps forward and does the noble thing in the face of great danger. While it is an old romantic theme, such gallantry under fire involves some real stand-alone decisions that might easily not have happened in war-torn Nanking if Miller, the lay-back, playboy westerner, had decided to use his immunity and skip town. Having found himself behind the walls of a cathedral church, Miller(played by Christian Bales), dressed in the garb of a priest, becomes a reluctant adult shepherd for a motley band of school girls, church staff,and prostitutes who have sought refuge there. Beating back repeated efforts of marauding Japanese soldiers to rape the young girls, Miller is eventually forced to consider an escape plan that involves the combined sacrifices of those prepared to die for the preservation of the next generation: a parent, a Chinese sniper, a courtesan. Quick decisions have to be made because the Japanese are closing in on what was once regarded as a safe enclave. As Miller drops any pretense of being a man of the cloth, he now assumes the role of a modern Moses who throws his lot in with the defenceless and innocent victims of war. The young lives that he helps save become the flowers that miraculously emerging from the carnage of war.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[56, 61]","If you've read Iris Chang's non-fiction book ""The Rape of Nanking"" you have some idea of what horrors to expect. As we know, in 1937 the Japanese invaded China; after conquering Shanghai, they turned their attention to the capitol, Nanking. The result was the slaughter of over 200,000 people.In this movie, based on the novel by Galing Yan (""Xiu Xiu, the Sent-Down Girl""), we have a fictionalized story in this chaotic setting. We are in a church compound where two groups seek shelter: the first, a dozen convent girls fleeing Japanese soldiers, and the second, a gaggle of ""working girls"" from a prominent brothel who throw their suitcases over the wall and demand sanctuary. A drunk but frightened Western mortician has come to prepare a priest for burial, and our story begins.....These were the few actors I could pick out of the cast:* Christian Bale (""The Dark Knight"") is the mortician, boozy and rude; Bale seems to enjoy playing a crude American who laughs in the face of their predicament. He first puts on a priest's robe to avoid Japanese bullets, but by the time he has to bury some of their little group, he isn't quite so blithe.* Paul Schneider (""Water for Elephants"") in a cameo as another American fleeing the massacre, is incredulous that our hero is choosing to stay and try to help his charges escape the city.* Ni Ni in her screen debut is the lovely self-appointed leader of the prostitutes. None of the women like the ""big-nosed"" Occidental, but a job is a job.* Xinyi Zhang (""Love is not Blind"") becomes, by default, the leader of the convent girls. She is observant, multi-lingual and expects her father to help them escape.Instantly, the two groups of females clash: the convent girls are horrified to think that ""those women"" would dare sully a church, while the prostitutes see the girls as nave, over-indulged virgins. We see moments of heroism, experience anxiety when characters make foolish choices and hold our breath when the soldiers make their demands. This is 1937 Nanking, so expect gunfire, blood, rape, and lots of blowie uppie stuff.Note: Because soldiers are always posted outside the church compound gates, all conversations are whispered, so unless your hearing is very, very good, wait for Amazon.com to release the DVD and see if it has closed captions.",5,Atrocities of War,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,2302,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'Iris', 'Chang', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'horrors', 'expect', 'know', '1937', 'Japanese', 'invaded', 'China', 'conquering', 'Shanghai', 'turned', 'attention', 'capitol', 'Nanking', 'result', 'was', 'slaughter', '200,000', 'people.In', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'Galing', 'Yan', 'Xiu', 'Xiu', 'Sent-Down', 'Girl', 'have', 'fictionalized', 'story', 'chaotic', 'setting', 'are', 'church', 'compound', 'where', 'two', 'groups', 'seek', 'shelter', 'first', 'dozen', 'convent', 'girls', 'fleeing', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'second', 'gaggle', 'working', 'girls', 'prominent', 'brothel', 'who', 'throw', 'suitcases', 'wall', 'demand', 'sanctuary', 'drunk', 'frightened', 'Western', 'mortician', 'come', 'prepare', 'priest', 'burial', 'story', '..These', 'were', 'few', 'actors', 'could', 'pick', 'cast', '*', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'mortician', 'boozy', 'rude', 'Bale', 'enjoy', 'playing', 'crude', 'American', 'who', 'face', 'predicament', 'first', 'priest', 'robe', 'avoid', 'Japanese', 'bullets', 'time', 'bury', 'little', 'group', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'blithe', '*', 'Paul', 'Schneider', 'Water', 'Elephants', 'cameo', 'American', 'fleeing', 'massacre', 'incredulous', 'hero', 'choosing', 'stay', 'try', 'help', 'charges', 'escape', 'city', '*', 'Ni', 'Ni', 'screen', 'debut', 'lovely', 'self-appointed', 'leader', 'prostitutes', 'None', 'women', 'big-nosed', 'Occidental', 'job', 'job', 'Xinyi', 'Zhang', 'Love', 'not', 'Blind', 'default', 'leader', 'convent', 'girls', 'observant', 'multi-lingual', 'father', 'help', 'escape.Instantly', 'two', 'groups', 'females', 'clash', 'convent', 'girls', 'are', 'horrified', 'think', 'women', 'would', 'dare', 'sully', 'church', 'prostitutes', 'see', 'girls', 'nave', 'over-indulged', 'virgins', 'see', 'moments', 'heroism', 'experience', 'anxiety', 'when', 'characters', 'make', 'foolish', 'choices', 'hold', 'breath', 'when', 'soldiers', 'make', 'demands', '1937', 'Nanking', 'so', 'expect', 'gunfire', 'blood', 'rape', 'lots', 'blowie', 'uppie', 'stuff.Note', 'soldiers', 'are', 'always', 'posted', 'church', 'compound', 'gates', 'conversations', 'are', 'whispered', 'hearing', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'wait', 'Amazon.com', 'release', 'DVD', 'see', 'closed', 'captions']",The Flowers of War

I decided to stream this on Netflix (available as of 11/25/12) and was impressed; The Flowers of War is a powerful and brutal war drama that was completely captivating.The story was deep and powerful. There are plenty of scenes that will disgust you, scenes that will make you angry, scenes that will make you sad; yet, there are even scenes that may make you smirk, or laugh. There are many action/war sequences (in fact, it begins with one) that are violent and suspenseful, they also really make you think; despite being such a brutal film about war, the film was shot beatifully, which is an accomplishment. The ending of the film was powerful, especially since the film doesn't give you all of the details and leaves your mind to wander. (I apologize for being ambiguous, but I don't want to spoil it.) Christian Bale did an amazing job, and I also enjoyed the children acting. The music complimented the film, which is a good thing.Overall, The Flowers of War is an effective war drama that has the power to move the audience, emotionally and mentally.

There are elements of the plot that strike me as somewhat improbable, but what's a movie without improbable plots?  The filming is extremely good. Although it has a reputation as being anti-Japanese it could have been far more so.I follow movies having to do with World War II in the Pacific.  My father fought there and was wounded on Luzon on 7 June 1945, shortly before the war ended.  He survived and lived to be 79.  What has fascinated me about the war was the behavior of the Japanese, who were extraordinarily brutal toward the residents of the areas they occupied.The Nanking Massacre has taken on legendary proportions as an example of Japanese ruthlessness.  This film deals only with a very small part of that story.  Most movies having to do with Nanking dwell on the slaughter of the Chinese residents by invading Japanese soldiers.  This one touches on it and has some great scenes of a very creative and brave single Chinese soldier who perishes holding off the Japanese while the girls escape early in the plot.A technical error in the film shows the Japanese concussion grenades being far more powerful than they actually were.  Four grenades were shown decimating the upper level of a stone building while, in reality, they would have killed nearby in it but would have left the building pretty much intact.  It made an entertaining scene, however.Much of the story that evolves takes place among the Chinese girls hiding in a large Catholic church in Nanking, roughly half of whom are Catholic school girls and half are prostitutes, and their improbable champion.  There's not much intermingling between the groups and the prime link between the two is the male lead, an undertaker posing as the Catholic priest who had been killed by the Japanese.  He plays the role of a roguish drunk who grows into a noble hero.  He has more in common with the prostitutes but becomes more and more protective of the school girls he winds up rescuing.The film is well-acted, has interesting and intricate sets and some good special effects.  The roguish drunk and the prostitutes were a bit overdone but it's still OK.  The ""making of"" featurette is fascinating.  I'm only giving it a four but would probably give a four-and-a-half if I could.",4,"Pretty good movie, few minor issues",1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,2315,"['looked', 'forward', 'movie', 'am', 'glad', 'purchased', 'are', 'elements', 'plot', 'strike', 'somewhat', 'improbable', 'what', 'movie', 'improbable', 'plots', 'filming', 'extremely', 'good', 'reputation', 'being', 'anti-Japanese', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'so.I', 'follow', 'movies', 'having', 'do', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Pacific', 'father', 'fought', 'there', 'was', 'wounded', 'Luzon', '7', 'June', '1945', 'shortly', 'war', 'ended', 'survived', 'lived', 'be', '79', 'What', 'fascinated', 'war', 'was', 'behavior', 'Japanese', 'who', 'were', 'extraordinarily', 'brutal', 'residents', 'areas', 'occupied.The', 'Nanking', 'Massacre', 'taken', 'legendary', 'proportions', 'example', 'Japanese', 'ruthlessness', 'film', 'only', 'very', 'small', 'part', 'story', 'Most', 'movies', 'having', 'do', 'Nanking', 'dwell', 'slaughter', 'Chinese', 'residents', 'invading', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'one', 'great', 'scenes', 'very', 'creative', 'brave', 'single', 'Chinese', 'soldier', 'who', 'holding', 'off', 'Japanese', 'girls', 'escape', 'early', 'plot.A', 'technical', 'error', 'film', 'Japanese', 'concussion', 'grenades', 'being', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'actually', 'were', 'Four', 'grenades', 'were', 'shown', 'decimating', 'upper', 'level', 'stone', 'building', 'reality', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'nearby', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'building', 'pretty', 'much', 'intact', 'made', 'entertaining', 'scene', 'however.Much', 'story', 'place', 'Chinese', 'girls', 'hiding', 'large', 'Catholic', 'church', 'Nanking', 'roughly', 'half', 'whom', 'are', 'Catholic', 'school', 'girls', 'half', 'are', 'prostitutes', 'improbable', 'champion', 'not', 'much', 'intermingling', 'groups', 'prime', 'link', 'two', 'male', 'lead', 'undertaker', 'posing', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'Japanese', 'role', 'roguish', 'drunk', 'who', 'noble', 'hero', 'more', 'common', 'prostitutes', 'more', 'more', 'protective', 'school', 'girls', 'up', 'rescuing.The', 'film', 'well-acted', 'interesting', 'intricate', 'sets', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'roguish', 'drunk', 'prostitutes', 'were', 'bit', 'overdone', 'still', 'OK', 'making', 'featurette', 'fascinating', ""'m"", 'only', 'giving', 'four', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'four-and-a-half', 'could']",The Flowers of War

What the Japanese did to the people of Nanking was beyond imagining. Unfortunately for even the few that were cultured and not rapists and murderers of women and children, going against their orders was not an option for a Japanese man.

We have your hookers with hearts of cold (but eventual gold), a tough talking American hero, innocent convent girls, evil Japanese who cannot help gloating and grinning while demonstrating their depravity. We also have the brave young sidekick and the traitorous collaborator who returns to the fold, the Hero Soldier who outsmarts the Japanese at every turn until he sacrifices himself for The Cause. Only Christian Bale's role is a little off the beaten path. You don't often encounter a hard-drinking devil-may-care Yank mortician/make up artist masquerading as a priest. Oh, wait a minute. He's a hair stylist too. No. Really.It's a stew all right, but somehow it works. The first 1/4 of the movie is spent thinking: Holy Stereotype,Batman...but don't give up. Buried under all that stuff is a genuinely moving little film.Bales is summoned to the cathedral in order to prepare the newly dead priest for burial. He travels through a city where the streets are literally awash with blood. The Japanese slaughter is in full gear and the dead and dying are everywhere.  America is not at war with Japan yet, and Westerners are somewhat safer than Chinese nationals. Still, his hand-lettered ""I'm an American, Don't Shoot Me"" sign isn't that helpful. Japanese soldiers can't read English, and some shoot or bayonet first and check identity second. When he finally gets inside the church, Bales decides it might be safer to be both an American and a priest; when the Japanese come knocking, he assumes the dead cleric's identity (and soon grows into the role...sort of).Next on the scene are The Convent Girls, an even dozen, followed by a gaggle of giggling hookers...thirteen in all.  This headcount will assume some deadly importance later.  The girls and prostitutes do not hit it off and the ladies of the night are relegated to the basement.  The girls take the upper floors. Crude symbolism?  Who cares. Just watch.At first, the Japanese officer in charge of the area seems paternal. Protective, even. But is he saving the girls or saving them for A Fate Worse Than Death?  Take a wild guess. The true nature of The Japanese Plan is revealed -- the girls are to be offered up as a special treat for Japanese brass once the soldiers are finished shooting, stabbing, blowing up, maiming, raping, disembowling and torturing the rest of Nanking's population...sort of like the Cherry on the Sundae of Unspeakable Acts. But wait...desperate times call for desperate measures and Our Tough But Kindly Prostitutes come up with a plan to Save The Virgins.  Turns out, they weren't always hookers...and one was a convent girl herself. Once.To say more would be to say too much.The movie created a firestorm of controvery when first released. Director Zhang Yimou does a very creditable job with his actors, getting strong performances out of each one, particularly in conveying very believable human emotions during a time of massacre. But the sexual aspect got him into hot water. Many Chinese critics compare the film and the director unfavorably to Stephen Spielberg, whose ""Schidler's List"" treated its subject matter with reverence, while Zhang and his team went for a more erotic tone.Zhang got scolded by every newspaper in China for besmirching the memory of The Rape of Nanking with a sex scene that was consensual and not at all violent. Ironic? No matter. All of China's intellectual elite and assorted Professors of Cinema were lining up to say 'tsk tsk.' Zhu Dake, one of China's most respected culture critics, chose the 74th anniversary of the Rape of Nanking to castigate the film.It didn't help matters that actress NiNi, who plays the beautiful leader of the Ladies of the Night, penned some newspaper articles under the name of her character, Yu Mo, in which she rhapsodizes about her 'night of love' before going off to face the Japanese hordes...a remarkably silly attempt at PR hype. Or that the producer wanted ticket prices to be the highest in Chinese film history. Sleaze plus making a buck off of the massacre?  Uh oh.  Even so, ""Flowers of War"" was China's Academy Award entry for Foreigh Film of the Year. It didn't make the cut, but did get a Golden Globe nomination.Some of Zhang's films are well known here in the West. Eroticism is usually an element, even a key element, but the director's touch is usually subtle.  Before watching Flowers of War, I'd check out Red Sorghum (1987), Ju Dou (1990), Raise the Red Lantern (1991), The Story of Qu Jiuo (1992), To Live (1994), Hero--the wuxia drama that was a #1 box office hit here in the U.S, and the delightful A Simple Noodle Story (2009), an unforgettable remake of the Coen brothers' Blood Simple.I would have given the film 5 stars but his other work is so much better, this doesn't belong on the same plane. If you don't know Zhang Yimou's work, or if Hero is all you know of him, he is worth investigation.",4,Chop Suey--but still tasty.,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,4999,"['cliche', 'unturned',

1516045,A8G9GETA2OLMZ,B006IW8EA2,P. Schumacher,"[0, 0]","In this movie, everything--and everyone--changes.It's a morality fable (quite a believable one) about Finding Your Inner Hero.Christian Bale goes from being a seamy, washed-up drunken mortician, who has landed in Nanking to bury a dead priest just as the Japanese overwhelm it, to being a fake (?) priest himself who, reluctantly, then with increasing courage, steps up to protect a group of Chinese student girls in the convent, and then a group of stranded high-class hookers.  I have never really liked Bale as an actor (as a person he seems friendly, good-hearted, and enormously hard-working); he always seems to be reacting to something in his head rather than something in the scene.  But here that quality actually helps.  His drunken-moocher phase is believably obnoxious, and his sobered up phase is gradual, thoughtful, and moving.The convent girls go from being insular, uncharitable narcissists to becoming open to radically different kinds of people and ready to venture into a dangerous, lethal escape.And the hookers go from being insecure, superficial feather-heads to being able to empathize with others, band together, and sacrifice themselves.This sounds mechanical but is brilliantly staged.  The first, maybe most important, hero figure is Major Li--the lone remaining Chinese army defender--who risks his life to get his wounded (boy) companion not to safety but a safe death, who stands up stoically to the withering abuse of the hookers, and who executes a brilliant, suicidal plan to trap the Japanese.Everything evolves from there.  Each act of courage inspires another in someone else.All the Japanese, except for Col. Hasegawa, are uniformly vicious.This makes the war-scenes even more intense, and makes you feel for every one of the small acts of courage and desperation against them.  Everyone one of the principal Chinese characters is wrenchingly appealing, and their deaths are horrifying.It's amazing that the director was able to pull such powerful performances from mostly first-time actors.The movie is mostly in Chinese (sometimes Japanese) but the subtitles are big and clear.Do watch the Special Features to get an idea of the grueling, meticulous grind of getting every scene perfect--but watch it after watching the movie.Definitely a must-see.",5,Brilliant.

1516063,A238W7T3KJAKQH,B006IW8EA2,shaun brammer,"[3, 5]","I have been a fan of Zhang Yimou's work since I watched Raise the Red Lantern as a young man. Zhang has always tried to tell the stories of modern China through the eyes of Chinese women victimized by the times. So, it is no surprise that he would one day choose to make a movie about the Rape of Nanking, a horrible orgy of violence and death the Imperial Japanese Army committed against the unarmed civilians of the city of Nanking during WWII. During these dark days women, from as young as children to the elderly, were gang raped by soldiers before being slaughtered. The list of crimes is too long to get in to for a movie review but the focus of this film is the women being victimized during this time. It is this terrible time in human history that Zhang Yimou tried to capture in J&#299;nl&iacute;ng Sh&iacute;s&#257;n Ch&#257;i, or Flowers of War.The movie is based on the book with the same title, by Yan Geling. While the characters in the film are fictional, they mirror real life people and occurrences. During the rape of the city there were western enclaves that the Japanese were told to leave alone. Japan was not yet at war with any western nation and was trying to avoid giving any western nation a reason to go to war against them. Therefore, these enclaves, churches were a common one, became hiding places for Chinese citizens. The westerners there would willing hide them and try to keep the Japanese at bay. The world may never have been aware of what happened in Nanking if it were not for the westerners who later left and told their governments about the horrors they witnessed.John Miller, played by Christian Bale, is an American living in Nanking working as a mortician. He takes up refuge himself in a church that was a school for girls. The priest in charge of the school, another westerner, has been killed. This leaves only a young boy George Chen, played by Huang Tianyuan, in charge of the students. Though one of the girls, who narrates the story, is a de-facto leader of the group, Shu, played by Zhang Xinyi. Soon a group of prostitutes from the famed Jade Paradise, a brothel in the red light district in town seek to take refuge there as well. They are led mostly by Yu Mo, played by Ni Ni, who tries to convince Miller to help them get out of the city. Miller carries his own demons, thus making him an unlikely candidate for a savior. A series of terrible events draw the pious school girls and working girls closer together, so when the Japanese High Command requests the school girls presence at a party and Miller and Yu Mo suspect that this will mean the young girls will be raped, they concoct a plan to help them escape the city, but not without a sacrifice.I can't say enough good things about this film. It was superbly shot, so the environment is real and eye catching. The action is visceral and intense. There are scenes with the remains of the Chinese army fighting off the Japanese invaders that are worthy of Saving Private Ryan. There are also two rape scenes which both are horrifyingly real. One is an attempt, but the camera angles used while the soldiers chase their victims about the church add a lurching and disorienting feeling. The other is a rape scene in full and is quite graphic, but not because it shows you everything. Instead this scene allows you only a couple angles leaving the rest to your imagination. It will haunt you when done.The film doesn't spend all it's time showing you violence however. It's focus is on the kindness of others, for Miller is meant to represent all the westerners who put their lives on the line to save other human beings, when they could have just left. They all had free passes to leave the city and were encouraged to do so by the Japanese. This is why I take issue with Ebert's review of this film when he asked why a white person has to be in the film at all. Clearly, Zhang has good reason to tell this tale if such a large aspect of history is lost upon the famous film critic.The kindness is also between the women and the girls hiding in the church. Zhang shows that these prostitutes did not set out to become working girls, but were forced by circumstance. They all had unique talents that went to waste because their society didn't support them. The young girls in the school, if not given a chance could end up just like them, but now that the city has been invaded their fate would be even worse. Zhang shows us who the victims of war really are, the civilians, the young, the women, as always the women suffer the violence of men.The film helps keep alive the memory of those horrible days, because most people still don't know about them and the more conservative elements in the Japanese government will not even admit that it happened. If they do, they say the Chinese make the events out to be worse than it was. As if one rape is better than another. So, this makes it a nationalistic film in one sense. However, I feel that Zhang addresses the issue of why these women became prostitutes and also shows the flaws in traditional Chinese society that allowed that to happen. Such a view harkens back to The May 4th Movement, which started a decade before the Rape of Nanking. I would almost wager that Zhang is using this film to invoke the self-criticism of the May Fourth intellectuals and direct it upon modern Chinese society. Zhang paints yet again a wonderful picture of Chinese heroines who are such because they bear the unjust suffering accorded their sex by the tyranny of men. I feel he takes to heart Mao's quote, ""Woman hold up half the sky"".",5,A Painful Memory Worth Keeping,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,5582,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'work', 'watched',

1516065,A2AN988COWP49T,B006IW8EA2,Shiragami Hiromi,"[3, 34]","This film is claiming that the story is inspired by true events.Well, apart from the part ""the Japanese Army indeed occupied the large part of Nanking on 13 December 1937"", this film's description of the event is totally fictional.According to the foreigners who were there at the time of the occupation of Nanking, who set up the Nanking Safety Zone for the Chinese refugees, they had almost all of those who still remain in Nanking, which figure, 200,000, was declared by Wong Kopang, the chief of police. Those people were put in the Safety Zone and then outside of the Safety Zone became empty like ghost town.When the Japanese Army finally reached there, they were thanked by the Committee that their artillery spared the Safety Zone in a ""fine way"".After the mopping up operation, which was done because the tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers fled into the Safety Zone disguising themselves as civilians, the Nanking became ""quiet"".Chinese refugees were so strong spirited they took things from the rich people's houses in the Safety Zone and sold them in the street market. The Japanese soldiers were their customers.Most of the Japanese Army left Nanking before Christmas to chase the Chinese Army who was clearly luring Japanese into the deep continent as Mao Tse-ton planned, and just 1,600 were left for the security, rebuilding of the infrastructure and maintenance of the city. They were busy to rebuild the normal life for the people. They were also busy to cremate the Japanese war dead to return them to their family.The members of the Committee wrote in their diaries how they enjoyed decollating for Christmas and the Japanese Army officers gave them a chunk of meat. On the New Year's Day, the Chinese refugees were given fire crackers to pop.They said that ""children had a grand time"".Around the Christmas, the Japanese Army started to separate the deserters from the civilian. Many were recognized as kidnapped farmers from nearby villages, as a typical Chinese Army recruiting method,  and given the ""good citizen certificate"".Because of this, the population of the Safety Zone increased to 250,000.Members of the Red Swastika Society were paid by the Japanese Army to bury the abandoned Chinese war dead. By then, people fled the city before December 1937 started to return and population swelled to 400,000 in March 1938.This is the truth. Yes, everybody in the world says that nobody says that Nanking Massacre never happened, but how could you believe those honest and kind Japanese soldiers were sex-crazed, hideous animals as this film says? (The Japanese never, ever urinates at water jar! They just never do that. Anybody who knows the Japanese would agree with me.)I would like to ask you. We know exactly who fought in the battle of Nanking. How come nobody was prosecuted or charged of mass murder and gang rape? Former Nazis are still getting charged and incarcerated. Why not those allegedly murderous Japanese?I hope some international libel lawyers take interest in this matter.I want those accusers to be summoned to the open court in front of the world and re-do the Tokyo Trial with decent, true international law applied this time.People must come to know who in fact burned the houses, raped the women and killed those Chinese people in China.Are you ready for the truth?",1,Malicious Falsehood,1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,3316,"['film', 'claiming', 'story', 'inspired', 'true', 'events.Well', 'apart', 'part', 'Japanese', 'Army', 'indeed', 'occupied', 'large', 'part', 'Nanking', '13', 'December', '1937', 'film', 'description', 'event', 'totally', 'fictional.According', 'foreigners', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'time', 'occupation', 'Nanking', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'Nanking', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'Chinese', 'refugees', 'had', 'almost', 'who', 'still', 'remain', 'Nanking', 'figure', '200,000', 'was', 'declared', 'Wong', 'Kopang', 'chief', 'police', 'people', 'were', 'put', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'then', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'became', 'empty', 'ghost', 'town.When', 'Japanese', 'Army', 'finally', 'reached', 'there', 'were', 'thanked', 'Committee', 'artillery', 'spared', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'fine', 'way', '.After', 'mopping', 'up', 'operation', 'was', 'done', 'tens', 'thousands', 'Chinese', 'soldiers', 'fled', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'disguising', 'civilians', 'Nanking', 'became', 'quiet', '.Chinese', 'refugees', 'were', 'so', 'strong', 'spirited', 'took', 'things', 'rich', 'people', 'houses', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'sold', 'street', 'market', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'were', 'customers.Most', 'Japanese', 'Army', 'left', 'Nanking', 'Christmas', 'chase', 'Chinese', 'Army', 'who', 'was', 'clearly', 'luring', 'Japanese', 'deep', 'continent', 'Mao', 'Tse-ton', 'planned', 'just', '1,600', 'were', 'left', 'security', 'rebuilding', 'infrastructure', 'maintenance', 'city', 'were', 'busy', 'rebuild', 'normal', 'life', 'people', 'were', 'also', 'busy', 'cremate', 'Japanese', 'war', 'dead', 'return', 'family.The', 'members', 'Committee', 'wrote', 'diaries', 'how', 'enjoyed', 'decollating', 'Christmas', 'Japanese', 'Army', 'officers', 'gave', 'chunk', 'meat', 'New', 'Year', 'Day', 'Chinese', 'refugees', 'were', 'given', 'fire', 'crackers', 'pop.They', 'said', 'children', 'had', 'grand', 'time', 'Christmas', 'Japanese', 'Army', 'started', 'separate', 'deserters', 'civilian', 'Many', 'were', 'recognized', 'kidnapped', 'farmers', 'nearby', 'villages', 'typical', 'Chinese', 'Army', 'recruiting', 'method', 'given', 'good', 'citizen', 'certificate', '.Because', 'population', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'increased', '250,000.Members', 'Red', 'Swastika', 'Society', 'were', 'paid', 'Japanese', 'Army', 'bury', 'abandoned', 'Chinese', 'war', 'dead', 'then', 'people', 'fled', 'city', 'December', '1937', 'started', 'return', 'population', 'swelled', '400,000', 'March', '1938.This', 'truth', 'Yes', 'everybody', 'world', 'nobody', 'Nanking', 'Massacre', 'never', 'happened', 'how', 'could', 'believe', 'honest', 'kind', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'were', 'sex-crazed', 'hideous', 'animals', 'film', 'Japanese', 'never', 'ever', 'water', 'jar', 'just', 'never', 'do', 'Anybody', 'who', 'Japanese', 'would', 'agree', 'would', 'like', 'ask', 'know', 'exactly', 'who', 'fought', 'battle', 'Nanking', 'How', 'come', 'nobody', 'was', 'prosecuted', 'charged', 'mass', 'murder', 'gang', 'rape', 'Former', 'Nazis', 'are', 'still', 'getting', 'charged', 'incarcerated', 'Why', 'not', 'allegedly', 'murderous', 'Japanese', 'hope', 'international', 'libel', 'lawyers', 'take', 'interest', 'matter.I', 'want', 'accusers', 'be', 'summoned', 'open', 'court', 'front', 'world', 're-do', 'Tokyo', 'Trial', 'decent', 'true', 'international', 'law', 'applied', 'time.People', 'must', 'come', 'know', 'who', 'fact', 'burned', 'houses', 'raped', 'women', 'killed', 'Chinese', 'people', 'China.Are', 'ready', 'truth']",The Flowers of War

The Japanese are taking control of the city. As a westerner Miller is allowed some leeway. When he gets to the church, he discovers they have no money to pay him. There is a group of a dozen girl students who want out. While he is trying to sort things out, a group of local prostitutes arrive seeking refuge from the war.John Miller immediately shows us his bad side. In addition to the conflict between the Japanese and Chinese, the students don't want the working girls there. The working girls want out of Nanking too and promise John ""unimaginable pleasures"" from all of them for safe passage.Eventually, Miller dons a priest cloak and goes from zero to hero as he works relentlessly to save the girls. It is a story which shows how the least of us become heroes.Much of the movie is in English, the rest has subtitles. There is some first person narration by one of the students.

When mortician John Miller (Bale) travels to Nanking, China in order to take care of a dead priest he is witness to the beginning of the Japanese siege. Upon arriving to the church he is upset that the children have no money to give him. He decides to stay at the church and look for what he can take. After a group of prostitutes show up he only wants one thing. After drinking all night he wakes up in a priest's clothes and witnesses an unspeakable horror that forever changes his way of thinking. This is an extremely emotional movie that deserves to be seen be a bigger audience then it will get. Christian Bale gives another Oscar worthy performance in a man who goes from selfish to selfless after witnessing how Japanese soldiers treat the young children that are staying at a church. Many parts of this movie are difficult to watch but this is also a movie that deserves to be seen. The movie will draw out many emotions in you ranging from anger to horror, but at it's core it is a very heartfelt journey of one man trying to save many. ""Life Is Beautiful"" meets ""Defiance"" with a little ""Schindlers List"" thrown in. I recommend this, if you can handle it. Overall, a little slow moving but a movie that deserves to be seen. I give it an A.",4,"A very emotional and disturbing look at the rape of Nanking. ""Life Is Beautiful"" mixed with ""Defiance"". Very good.
