I knew it was a lower budget productiuon and I also understand that the short book of Ruth isn't much material to make a full length movie. And to be fair, they did a good job of not straying too far from the Biblical text.However, the acting is weak and the script worse, really bad at points. Dan Haggerty is the only one who can deliver a line and he has just a few. The characters all look like the came from Iowa, not the Middle East. Little things like all the clothes looking brand new and clean make it look more like a Sunday school play than a modern period piece.With a little better directing and a few different actors, this could have been pretty good.

I went in expecting a LOT more and so was disappointed. I will likely watch it again now knowing what to expect and will probably enjoy it more.Several reviewers said this was the most accurate movie of the story of Ruth, I agree that's probably true, but that's not really saying much given the other options.

Murphy,"[90, 107]","The movie ""Book of Ruth"" is very good overall....and mostly follows the Biblical story line, though it's a B-rated type film (you know...acting is good by some, not all people involved, money is tight for the budget, etc...).  We originally had added Book of Ruth to our Biblical collection, because it's close to the Biblical account and doesn't put so many inaccuracies into your head.HOWEVER, the ""Story of Ruth"" film also sold is something we tried from library before deciding to buy and WOULDN'T BUY IT.  Oy!  It's purely made up, full of errors according to the Biblical book of Ruth.  So buy this film here, NOT the other one!HAVING SAID THIS...here's an update we came to decision on a while back:The one exception to us recommending this film, is going to only strike a positive/helpful note with few people (we realize), but nevertheless....the problem we have with this film is that real live human beings with real life families (husbands, and/or wives, and/or children) are being intimate with other people outside of their family all for the sake of ""it's just a job, it's acting."" We personally don't believe that God will every approve body-close-holding and smooching, as ""just a job so it's okay"" when it comes to non-married people. You simply won't find that kind of behavior ever supported or condoned in the Bible. As i said, we realize this won't be a popular stance, in a Media-soaked culture, but nonetheless...it's the flat truth. So we cannot recommend you actually buy this film. There ARE films on the market, few though, that have actual actors who are husbands and wives being intimate on screen...or that have husbands and wives pictured who aren't married outside the movie but BARELELY touch in any intimate way (like FireProof, Facing the Giants, Time Changer, Flywheel, and others). We recommend you just place your own family member in the actor's spot, and see how you'd feel watching your partner or child doing the intimacy with a complete stranger (IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN OR SPOUSE).

1287824,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B002T7X4UK,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[4, 4]","The Biblical book of Ruth is dramatized with excellent accuracy to the scripture. A mix of both novice and acclaimed cast proves adequate, though not stellar. Perhaps it is due to the dialogue writing that they seem somewhat stilted, lacking in emotion. Most dialogue omits the contemporary use of contractions, where they were used it sounded better to me. Neither was there an attempt to give it a Biblical intonation. Regardless, the scenes were beautiful, sets believable, costuming well done, and over all a very good scripture rendition of the events of Naomi and Ruth.Let's face it; the book of Ruth is not exactly romantic, not adventurous, not intriguing, not suspenseful, but history of major importance for the linage of David being from Bethlehem, and thus the prophesy of a Christ Child born of the House of David in a Bethlehem stable. But the 85 verses of Ruth were compacted well into just 91 minutes. I enjoyed Sherry Morris as Ruth, and Dan Haggerty (Grizzly Adams) as Simeon.This is obviously a film made for the followers of the Christian faith, not a twist of content to make it more romantic or to include some sinister political plot. That's why I liked it, a very good job for the intended audience, on a budget that makes it affordable. It follows Naomi and Ruth from the famine in Moab, their trek back to Israel, through the Boaz field gleaning, Naomi's push to get Ruth married, and of course then the union that produced a son, Obed, grandfather to David. The film opens and ends with David and his granddad talking, Obed telling his grandson the story of the women, of faith, of the `loving-kindness' found in story (& scriptures), of Gods provision for King David's ancestress, of the integrity shown by Boaz, the benevolence expressed so often in these scriptures, and of course just the linage prophecy. It speaks of faithfulness, ""wither thou goest, I will go"". The film visualizes scriptures like: `uncover his feet, and lay thee down', and `a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor', but in the film the sandal became a missile launched by an angry Neb toward Boaz.So dialogue could have been better, and the film did offer subtitles but they were unfortunately not quite in sync with the scene changes.
