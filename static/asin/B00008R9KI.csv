It appears to be a sex scandal but it may hide an even bigger British government cover up as a trio of reporters sets out to discover.Dark and brodding Gabriel Bryne (1950) plays a new and eager newspaper reporter. Bryne is that marvelous Irish actor who gave us remarkable performances in Miller's Crossing (1990) and ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995). He received two Emmy nominations for the TV series ""In Treatment"" for which he won a Golden Globe in 2009. He's said - ""Sometimes, the vanity of actors is that we imagine we're so completely different on screen from who we are in real life. When really, all actors play themselves.""Denholm Elliott (1922-92) plays the elder statesman of the reporters. Elliott won BAFTA awards for Best Supporting Actor 3 years in a row, 1984-6 (""Trading Places"", ""A Private Function"", ""Defense of the Realm""). In all, he had 9 nominations and 4 wins. American audiences probably know him best as Harrison Ford's associate from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981).Big Robbie Coltrane (1950) is best known as Hagrid from the ""Harry Potter"" series and from his two James Bond films, ""Golden Eye"" (1995) and ""The World is Not Enough"" (1999) in which he played a former KGB operative turned mafia boss. Coltrane is another reporter.Ian Bannen (1928-99) was a staple in films and on British TV for 45 years. He was nominated for an Oscar (""The Flight of the Phoenix"" and twice for a BAFTA (""Hope and Glory"", ""The Offence""). U.S. audiences might remember him as the leperous father in ""Braveheart"" (1995) or as Terry Adamson in ""To Walk With Lions"" (1999). Bannen plays the Profumo-like MP at the center of the controversy.Greta Scacchi (1960) plays Bannen's secretary who ultimately gets involved in the search for the cover up. Scacchi won the Emmy for ""Rasputin"" (1996) and was nominated for ""Broken Trail"" (2006). She does a great job and one can only wish there were more scenes with her. For that metter, Bannen and Elliott are also underused.Director David Drury works primarily in TV. This was his second (and last) feature film and judging for this film, he is best suited for TV. That's meant as a complement. The film is tight, taut, and moves quickly. It's also remarkably short given the scope of the story, and this may lead some viewers to criticize the film for being difficult to follow. That being said, this is a film that forces you to put the pieces together, so it does require a bit of brain power because the plot is not handed to you on a platter.The film has many noir elements, and had a little more time been taken with the story, it might have made an excellent film. As it is it is very good and will appeal to people who like spy thrillers and/or detective stories with a twist. The acting is very good and the photography is compelling.",4,Good Spy Thriller with Twists,1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,2913,"['Defense', 'Realm', 'was', 'made', '1985', 'end', 'Cold', 'War', 'when', 'Russians', 'were', 'still', 'supposed', 'be', 'bad', 'guys', 'be', 'sex', 'scandal', 'may', 'hide', 'even', 'bigger', 'British', 'government', 'cover', 'up', 'trio', 'reporters', 'sets', 'out', 'discover.Dark', 'brodding', 'Gabriel', 'Bryne', '1950', 'new', 'eager', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'Bryne', 'marvelous', 'Irish', 'actor', 'who', 'gave', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'Miller', 'Crossing', '1990', 'Usual', 'Suspects', '1995', 'received', 'two', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'TV', 'series', 'Treatment', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', '2009', 'said', 'Sometimes', 'vanity', 'actors', 'imagine', ""'re"", 'so', 'completely', 'different', 'screen', 'who', 'are', 'real', 'life', 'When', 'really', 'actors', 'play', 'Denholm', 'Elliott', '1922-92', 'elder', 'statesman', 'reporters', 'Elliott', 'won', 'BAFTA', 'awards', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', '3', 'years', 'row', '1984-6', 'Trading', 'Places', 'Private', 'Function', 'Defense', 'Realm', 'had', '9', 'nominations', '4', 'wins', 'American', 'audiences', 'probably', 'know', 'best', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'associate', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', '1981', '.Big', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', '1950', 'best', 'known', 'Hagrid', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'two', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'Golden', 'Eye', '1995', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', '1999', 'played', 'former', 'KGB', 'operative', 'turned', 'mafia', 'boss', 'Coltrane', 'reporter.Ian', 'Bannen', '1928-99', 'was', 'staple', 'films', 'British', 'TV', '45', 'years', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Flight', 'Phoenix', 'twice', 'BAFTA', 'Hope', 'Glory', 'Offence', 'U.S.', 'audiences', 'might', 'remember', 'leperous', 'father', 'Braveheart', '1995', 'Terry', 'Adamson', 'Walk', 'Lions', '1999', 'Bannen', 'Profumo-like', 'MP', 'center', 'controversy.Greta', 'Scacchi', '1960', 'Bannen', 'secretary', 'who', 'ultimately', 'involved', 'search', 'cover', 'up', 'Scacchi', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Rasputin', '1996', 'was', 'nominated', 'Broken', 'Trail', '2006', 'great', 'job', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'scenes', 'metter', 'Bannen', 'Elliott', 'are', 'also', 'underused.Director', 'David', 'Drury', 'primarily', 'TV', 'was', 'second', 'last', 'feature', 'film', 'judging', 'film', 'best', 'suited', 'TV', 'meant', 'complement', 'film', 'tight', 'taut', 'moves', 'quickly', 'also', 'remarkably', 'short', 'given', 'scope', 'story', 'may', 'lead', 'viewers', 'criticize', 'film', 'being', 'difficult', 'follow', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'require', 'bit', 'brain', 'power', 'plot', 'not', 'handed', 'platter.The', 'film', 'many', 'noir', 'elements', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'been', 'taken', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'excellent', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'will', 'appeal', 'people', 'who', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'and/or', 'detective', 'stories', 'twist', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'photography', 'compelling']",N/A

746756,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00008R9KI,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[8, 11]","This is a tough film to review because on one hand it doesn't take a linear approach to plot/storytelling, which means that the viewer has to fit a lot of the pieces together. But the thing is, there are different approaches to making a film in which the viewer has to fit pieces together.For example, in ""Fear X"", with John Turturro, the method used in which the pieces have to be fit together is an intriguing one because, principally, we are given some extremely interesting characters who pull us into the story and make us WANT to put the pieces together. The difference between ""Fear X"" and ""Defense of the Realm"" is instructive. In the latter, the primary focus in NOT on the characters but instead on the plot machinations that beg the viewer to fill in the gaps. This plot-driven approach--with basically flat characters--does very little to really attract the viewer enough to want to put the pieces together.Instead, we are taken from point A to point B, almost willy-nilly, with the filmmakers (writer and director) expecting us to do what has to be done to make sense of the film without providing characters we really care about. This makes the filmgoing experience a relatively dreary one. Briefly, reporter gets top story on political scandal, repercussions ensue, reporter digs up more information, the plot thickens (with emphasis on the word ""thick""), revelations emerge, tragedy develops--and  headlines, headlines, headlines.Gabriel Byrne does a competent job in his first starring role as the reporter Nick Mullen, but the real heart of the film is Denholm Elliot who turns in a smashing performance. If only he had been given more time on screen! He's really the soul of ""Defense of the Realm"", the one who we DO care about, because he's a fully fleshed out character--in fact, the only one. He's a real pleasure to watch and perfectly conveys the tremendous anxiety that high-level political secrets carry with them.Also on hand turning in competent performances are Greta Scacchi and Ian Bannen. But as is true of Nick Mullen, they are mostly undeveloped and only exist to move the plot along, such as it is.With more substantial writing in which characters were more fully developed, this would have been a much more gripping film.
