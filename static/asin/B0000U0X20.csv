It was some underground comic books and I don't know what else.  Coming into it with no clue about all this background, I was quite impressed.  The movie does pull you into the world of Harvey Pekar, which apparently blurs the boundaries between fact and fiction to give us ordinary life.  It's also an excellent trip through the 60s, 70s and 80s, and a great way to spend a couple of hours, and you'll think about it after it's over.  In other words, get it.",4,I'm Impressed,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,553,"['left', 'USA', '1999', 'so', 'have', 'clue', 'material', 'preceded', 'film', 'was', 'underground', 'comic', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'Coming', 'clue', 'background', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'movie', 'pull', 'world', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'apparently', 'boundaries', 'fact', 'fiction', 'give', 'ordinary', 'life', 'also', 'excellent', 'trip', '60s', '70s', '80s', 'great', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', ""'ll"", 'think', 'over', 'other', 'words', 'get']",American Splendor
783912,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B0000U0X20,Alistair McHarg,"[1, 1]","Begin with a doomed man - Harvey Pekar.  Put him in a doomed city - Cleveland.  Give him the ultimate dead-end job - file clerk at a VA Hospital.  It sounds like the beginning of a really horrifying Kafka novel, a study in existential despair devoid of color, joy, passion, or meaning.On one level that's exactly what it is; part of Pekar's charm is that he has unapologetically flushed away his American dream.  Pekar embraces failure the way mothers embrace children; failure is his best friend and most trusted ally.  There are no shiny cars in his future, no prom queens.  The vanities that most of us pursue with blind devotion are of no interest to him.But this complete lack of ambition is precisely what frees Pekar to be so blindingly honest about the world around him, able to chronicle the most pedestrian activities with a sly, sardonic sneer.  Whenever we are in danger of believing that Pekar is looking down at life with supercilious revulsion, we are quickly reminded that he reserves the bulk of his contempt for himself.  Pekar is no mere misanthrope; he is an alien in our midst.To embody such an improbable being takes acting genius, and Paul Giamatti delivers an Oscar caliber performance.  Not only does he make this sport of nature believable, he makes him likeable - something of a minor miracle.  Indeed, American Splendor ends up being an emotionally compelling film, it resonates truth at every turn.  You may go your whole life without ever meeting people like this, (and you'd probably be happier as a result), but you will care about them, and cheer their triumphs - even though these triumphs can only be viewed under a microscope.This is a rare, bizarre, and thoroughly enchanting film.",5,Splendor With Some Grass,1168992000,"01 17, 2007",2007,1718,"['Begin', 'doomed', 'man', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'Put', 'doomed', 'city', 'Cleveland', 'Give', 'ultimate', 'dead-end', 'job', 'file', 'clerk', 'VA', 'Hospital', 'beginning', 'really', 'horrifying', 'Kafka', 'novel', 'study', 'existential', 'despair', 'devoid', 'color', 'joy', 'passion', 'meaning.On', 'one', 'level', 'exactly', 'what', 'part', 'Pekar', 'charm', 'unapologetically', 'flushed', 'away', 'American', 'dream', 'Pekar', 'failure', 'way', 'mothers', 'embrace', 'children', 'failure', 'best', 'friend', 'most', 'trusted', 'ally', 'are', 'shiny', 'cars', 'future', 'prom', 'vanities', 'most', 'pursue', 'blind', 'devotion', 'are', 'interest', 'him.But', 'complete', 'lack', 'ambition', 'precisely', 'what', 'Pekar', 'be', 'so', 'blindingly', 'honest', 'world', 'able', 'chronicle', 'most', 'pedestrian', 'activities', 'sly', 'sardonic', 'sneer', 'are', 'danger', 'believing', 'Pekar', 'looking', 'down', 'life', 'supercilious', 'revulsion', 'are', 'quickly', 'reminded', 'reserves', 'bulk', 'contempt', 'Pekar', 'mere', 'misanthrope', 'alien', 'midst.To', 'embody', 'such', 'improbable', 'being', 'acting', 'genius', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'performance', 'Not', 'only', 'make', 'sport', 'nature', 'believable', 'likeable', 'something', 'minor', 'miracle', 'Indeed', 'American', 'Splendor', 'up', 'being', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'film', 'truth', 'turn', 'may', 'go', 'whole', 'life', 'ever', 'meeting', 'people', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'happier', 'result', 'will', 'care', 'cheer', 'triumphs', 'even', 'triumphs', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'viewed', 'microscope.This', 'rare', 'bizarre', 'thoroughly', 'enchanting', 'film']",American Splendor

Very faithful to the original and to Harvey Pekar and what he stands for.The switching back and forth between the real Harvey and the actor who portrays him gets a bit confusing and jarring at times, and it will require multiple viewings for those not familiar with the adventures of our man Mr. Pekar and Joyce, Mr. Boats, Toby, etc. (Freddie the Moocher or Emil the hermit aren't in the film, but that's a minor complaint). The actor playing Mr. Boats, the elderly black crumudgeon, is a tad stiff. I've always visualized James Earl Jones or Louis Gossett Jr. in that role.But the film as a whole works as the story of the triumph of the common everyday working man in spite of himself. You'll recoil at the exploitation of Toby the nerd (his identifying with the comedy ""Revenge of the Nerds"", a scene straight from the AS books, is funny, sad, and touching at the same time), and you'll cheer as Harvey ""socks it"" to David Letterman and his audience.Read the American Splendor Anthology, see the movie (more than once), laugh, think, and enjoy.",4,Almost as fine as the books,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,1183,"['Longtime', 'fans', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'was', 'turned', 'American', 'Splendor', 'books', 'college', 'student', '1987', 'will', 'absolutely', 'love', 'Very', 'faithful', 'original', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'what', 'for.The', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'real', 'Harvey', 'actor', 'who', 'bit', 'confusing', 'jarring', 'times', 'will', 'require', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'not', 'familiar', 'adventures', 'man', 'Mr.', 'Pekar', 'Joyce', 'Mr', 'Boats', 'Toby', 'etc', 'Freddie', 'Moocher', 'Emil', 'hermit', 'are', ""n't"", 'film', 'minor', 'complaint', 'actor', 'playing', 'Mr', 'Boats', 'elderly', 'black', 'crumudgeon', 'tad', 'stiff', ""'ve"", 'always', 'visualized', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'film', 'whole', 'works', 'story', 'triumph', 'common', 'everyday', 'working', 'man', 'spite', ""'ll"", 'recoil', 'exploitation', 'Toby', 'nerd', 'identifying', 'comedy', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'scene', 'straight', 'AS', 'books', 'funny', 'sad', 'touching', 'same', 'time', ""'ll"", 'cheer', 'Harvey', 'David', 'Letterman', 'audience.Read', 'American', 'Splendor', 'Anthology', 'see', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'laugh', 'think', 'enjoy']",American Splendor
783914,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000U0X20,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Creating something real, unreal, familiar yet completely original; directors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini pulled out all the stops with `American Splendor', one of the most innovative and unforgettable biopics I've ever seen.  Ingeniously mixing real life with reel life, `American Splendor' may turn off a few viewers, but for those of you willing to give it some time it will truly open your eyes to the endless possibilities of cinema.  With brilliant casting, stunning script work and truly remarkable craftsmanship, `American Splendor' will definitely be an unforgettable cinematic experience.Who ever thought that comic books could be so influential?The life of comic book hero Harvey Pekar is told with vivacious tenacity in this multilayered biopic that exposes his human personality as well as his alter ego.  With a knack for fleshing out the truth in life, Pekar created something that no one else had even attempted, and in the process he created a following I don't think he even understood.  Starting with the conception of his comic and moving forward through his strange marriage and odd social skills, not to mention some inevitable health issues; `American Splendor' never loses its grasp on what makes this film so fresh and whimsical.Thanks to some inspired casting, this film nails just about every punch.Let's talk about Paul Giamatti for a minute.  I remember in 2004 when `Sideways' was released and everyone started screaming Oscar and talking about how Giamatti's performance was just too good.  I remember seeing the film and falling out of my chair (figuratively) because for the first time the hype was correct.  He was `that' good.  Then the inevitable snub came and it wasn't until the following year when he hammed it up for Ron Howard that he received an Oscar nomination (please note that, while I say `hammed' it up, I am not really insulting his performance, which I enjoyed, but merely stating that sometimes you have to create a caricature for Oscar to pay you any attention).  Around that time I started hearing about this film.  Personally I hadn't heard anything about it until then, and honestly I didn't see the film until last weekend, but the seed was planted.This performance, believe it or not, is even BETTER than the one he delivered in `Sideways'.Capturing this man in all variations of his persona (and brilliantly meshing with the `real' Pekar who appears in the film as well as the animated versions), Giamatti is a full-figured representation of a truly inspired characterization.  He understands the lows, the highs and everything in between, completely realizing his characters potential.  He's so good that I barely noticed the rest of the cast, even when they were working magic as well (especially Hope Davis, who is criminally underrated in the world of cinema).As a whole I strongly recommend this film to any fan of the biopic, the human drama, the dramedy, Giamatti or comic books...UGH, I recommend it to everyone since this is really what cinema is all about.",5,A totally new and exciting way to look at moviemaking...,1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,3036,"['Creating', 'something', 'real', 'unreal', 'familiar', 'yet', 'completely', 'original', 'directors', 'Shari', 'Springer', 'Berman', 'Robert', 'Pulcini', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'American', 'Splendor', 'one', 'most', 'innovative', 'unforgettable', 'biopics', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Ingeniously', 'mixing', 'real', 'life', 'reel', 'life', 'American', 'Splendor', 'may', 'turn', 'off', 'few', 'viewers', 'willing', 'give', 'time', 'will', 'truly', 'open', 'eyes', 'endless', 'possibilities', 'cinema', 'brilliant', 'casting', 'stunning', 'script', 'work', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'craftsmanship', 'American', 'Splendor', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'unforgettable', 'cinematic', 'experience.Who', 'ever', 'thought', 'comic', 'books', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'influential', 'life', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'told', 'vivacious', 'tenacity', 'multilayered', 'biopic', 'human', 'personality', 'as', 'well', 'alter', 'ego', 'knack', 'fleshing', 'out', 'truth', 'life', 'Pekar', 'created', 'something', 'one', 'else', 'had', 'even', 'attempted', 'process', 'created', 'following', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'understood', 'Starting', 'conception', 'comic', 'moving', 'forward', 'strange', 'marriage', 'odd', 'social', 'skills', 'not', 'mention', 'inevitable', 'health', 'issues', 'American', 'Splendor', 'never', 'grasp', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'fresh', 'whimsical.Thanks', 'inspired', 'casting', 'film', 'just', 'about', 'punch.Let', 'talk', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'minute', 'remember', '2004', 'when', 'Sideways', 'was', 'released', 'everyone', 'started', 'screaming', 'Oscar', 'talking', 'how', 'Giamatti', 'performance', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'remember', 'seeing', 'film', 'falling', 'chair', 'figuratively', 'first', 'time', 'hype', 'was', 'correct', 'was', 'good', 'Then', 'inevitable', 'snub', 'came', 'was', ""n't"", 'following', 'year', 'when', 'hammed', 'up', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'please', 'note', 'say', 'hammed', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'insulting', 'performance', 'enjoyed', 'merely', 'stating', 'sometimes', 'have', 'create', 'caricature', 'Oscar', 'pay', 'attention', 'time', 'started', 'hearing', 'film', 'Personally', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'anything', 'then', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'last', 'weekend', 'seed', 'was', 'planted.This', 'performance', 'believe', 'not', 'even', 'BETTER', 'one', 'delivered', ""Sideways'.Capturing"", 'man', 'variations', 'persona', 'brilliantly', 'meshing', 'real', 'Pekar', 'who', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'animated', 'versions', 'Giamatti', 'full-figured', 'representation', 'truly', 'inspired', 'characterization', 'lows', 'highs', 'everything', 'completely', 'realizing', 'characters', 'potential', 'so', 'good', 'barely', 'noticed', 'rest', 'cast', 'even', 'when', 'were', 'working', 'magic', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'who', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'world', 'cinema', 'whole', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fan', 'biopic', 'human', 'drama', 'dramedy', 'Giamatti', 'comic', 'books', 'UGH', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'really', 'what', 'cinema']",American Splendor

If I hear critics saying ""it changed my life"" then I will care even less about a movie. In fact, if someone tells me a movie will make me feel something, I'll try my hardest to NOT feel that.Second, Shari Springer Berman and Rob Pulcini get top props foractually achieving everything people were saying they had. It was oscar nominated and 25 more wins and 21 nominations at other festivals and organizations.This movie did make me laugh, cry and think. It made me realize I'm just the same as the main characters: I have funny lines, but tradegy is waiting just a half an act away.American Splendor is the (basically) true story of Harvey Pekar. A simple file clerk at a VA hospital, his second marriage going poorly, and the poor sap is losing his voice, from a hole in his vocal cords. This guy can't catch a break: after he gets home from the doctors, his wife leaves him. He's depressed, with no where to go.Flashback a couple years, where Harvey is at a garage sale, feeding one of his habits: vinyl record collecting. He's with some friends, when they introduce him to a strange looking guy named Rob Crumb. He's a bookish type, who is also into jazz records, and comic books so they hit it off. Rob, however doesn't just like comics however, he has started to draw them.Back to Harvey's divorce, Crumb is now famous on the underground comics scene, and Harvey realizes he's done nothing with his life. After a hilarious scene in a a grocery store, Harvey thinks 'I'll just write a comic about the stuff in my life.'This movie used a couple things to get a four star rating: innovation, heart, and of course, the disc itself.The innovation, in the sense that the people the actors are portraying take part in interviews, they are there in stock footage, and Harvey even narrates over Paul Giammati's acting out his life. This was a great idea, because you feel 'wow, harvey was real, his life did suck, his wife joyce was crazy, etc.' You don't see a lot of biopics where the actors are actually being 'directed' by the people that lived it.It's got heart, as I said, because of it's bold faced truth, and simplicity. The film makers captured so much feeling...And finally, the disc. Picture quality is pretty good, even in the scenes shot in beta. There isn't much grain, and the colors are dulled on pupose. None of this hinders viewing. The sound however, is standard, as the music is about the same volume as the voices, and sometimes I had trouble hearing something that was important.Special features are everywhere! There's so many, they had to hide some. For a one disc set, and not even a 'special-perfect-collectors-criterion' or anything.The commentary is awesome. We have Harvey Pekar, his wife, Joyce Brabner, his best friend (and funniest character) Toby Radloff, their daughter Danielle Batone, Paul Giamatti who plays Harvey, the directors, and eventual Judah Friedlander (who I recognized from I love the 80's.... shudder). They cover everything from cameos, anachronisms, film techniques, and the real life truths versus some of the film's fudged writing.We also get a featurette about the Pekars, and their life after the movie. A comic, some hilarious easter eggs, and the common trailers and dvd rom links.

Paul Giamatti portrays Harvey Pekar, an underground comic book writer of the 1970s (to present) who showcases in his works the everyday mundane existence of average Americans, including himself. Never wholly good or bad, just life from an honest and gritty perspective a la Charles Bukowski. In this docu-movie we follow Harvey through his years of obscurity as a Cleveland file clerk who befriends the infamous Robert Crumb, to the peak of his celebrity as he does several spots on the Letterman show. He is shown to be a gruff and tempermental character but with a soft side that makes him wholly enjoyable. So as not to give any of the storyline away for those unfamiliar with the artist, Harvey, through all of his struggles with career and marriage remains the same grounded average Joe. For the real fans there are even several spots with the writer himself in this sometimes comic book movie.The casting is rather good with Giammati in the lead and Hope Davis as his forceful but understanding wife. Giammati is a cross between Vincent D'Onfrio and Nick Tortelli (Carla's husband)from cheers (whatever his name is) and is always a believable force on the screen. Hope Davis is the Velma of the seedy underground comic/geek underworld. The rest of the supporting cast are great stock characters and mirror the real life entities which encompassed Pekar's life. For those of you who might have been put off by the Crumb movie, this was done far more conventionally and without the grotesque, sad nature of the afforementioned film. But that's probably more to do with the subject and not ability.

783919,A2ZHDCYYP1PL2K,B0000U0X20,"brewster22 ""brewster22""","[0, 1]","&quot;American Splendor&quot; is a terrific film, and easily one of the best of 2003 (though that's not saying much). It tells the story of Harvey Pekar, famous in comic book circles for starting the American Splendor series.  I didn't know anything about him or the series before I saw this movie, so it might be even more enjoyable for those who do. Or, as so often happens with biopics, an educated viewer might find that the story plays too loosely with facts.  I can't answer for that, but I can say that I enjoyed this film very much.Paul Giamatti seems to be born to play Pekar.  He's got the perfect hang-dog, born-loser aura about him.  Hope Davis is also very good as Pekar's equally strange wife.  This film got a lot of attention for its unconventional approach to story telling, using animation and documentary-like clips of the real Harvey Pekar to highlight the fictional portion of the film.  For that reason, I was actually expecting this film to be more indie than it feels.  As is, it's good, but it's fairly conventional.  That's the only thing about it that disappointed me slightly.But still, even if slightly more conventional than I would have wished, it's more intelligent than 95% of the other conventional films floating around out there.Grade: A",4,Very Good Biopic,1078876800,"03 10, 2004",2004,1273,"['quot', 'American', 'Splendor', 'quot', 'terrific', 'film', 'easily', 'one', 'best', '2003', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'story', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'famous', 'comic', 'book', 'circles', 'starting', 'American', 'Splendor', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'series', 'saw', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'who', 'do', 'so', 'often', 'biopics', 'educated', 'viewer', 'might', 'find', 'story', 'too', 'loosely', 'facts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'answer', 'can', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'very', 'much.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'be', 'born', 'play', 'Pekar', 'got', 'perfect', 'hang-dog', 'born-loser', 'aura', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Pekar', 'equally', 'strange', 'wife', 'film', 'got', 'lot', 'attention', 'unconventional', 'approach', 'story', 'telling', 'using', 'animation', 'documentary-like', 'clips', 'real', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'highlight', 'fictional', 'portion', 'film', 'reason', 'was', 'actually', 'expecting', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'indie', 'good', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'only', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'slightly.But', 'still', 'even', 'slightly', 'more', 'conventional', 'would', 'have', 'wished', 'more', 'intelligent', '95', '%', 'other', 'conventional', 'films', 'floating', 'there.Grade']",American Splendor

783921,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0000U0X20,calvinnme,"[2, 2]","This is really a great film about Harvey Pekar, the underground comic book writer who created the comic book series ""American Splendor"". I'm surprised this movie hasn't garnered more critical attention than it has. The movie basically takes you from the end of Harvey's second marriage up to the point of his retirement as a file clerk. Pekar is living a life of quiet desperation - everything in his life is generic. The film lends a dingy quality to Pekar's surroundings that really gives it that ""garage sale"" look right down to the light fixtures in his apartment. Even the supermarkets and restaurants Harvey frequent make K-mart look classy. Unlike his friends and coworkers though, he is painfully aware of the reality of his life. He has a moment of clarity one day while waiting in line at the grocery store behind a woman who is arguing over why she should pay 1.50 for six glasses that are marked two dollars, when he thinks of a way to strike out at all of this - he decides to document his feelings in a comic. Unfortunately, Harvey can't draw. He comes up with the narrative, but is only able to show stick figures as the actual characters in the drawings. Harvey's big break is that he has become friends with underground comic Robert Crumb before Crumb was famous and the two were just a couple of ""ordinary"" guys looking for bargains at Cleveland rummage sales. Crumb is impressed with the statement Harvey is trying to make and agrees to do the illustrations, thus the comic ""American Splendor"" is born.To me, the best part of this movie is the love story between Harvey and his third wife Joyce. These two people are just weird enough to make it work. What makes it work is that they have staked out their own individual claims to different enough territories in the land of weird that their respective neuroses don't bump into one another too badly, as had happened in Harvey's past marriages. Harvey is a man who has very un-mundane statements to make about his mundane world, but doesn't have any real illusions about changing it. Joyce is a self-diagnosed depressed anemic who has memorized the DSM 3 and is therefore happy to diagnose people with personality disorders and then pretty much takes them as she finds them, in spite of her claims of being a reformer. Because neither one wants to change the other, the relationship works.The film is really cleverly done, with comic book illustrations showing what Pekar is thinking in various situations along with narration and a couple of interviews with the actual Pekar and his wife interspersed throughout the film giving it a real feeling of authenticity. Paul Giamatti is simply marvelous as the caustic ""warts and more"" Harvey Pekar. How often do you see an actor share the screen with the person he is playing, as happens in this film, and not even notice a blip in continuity? His performance is that good. Giamatti certainly deserves better than playing supporting roles in films like ""Big Fat Liar"". Kudos also to James Urbaniak for his small role as artist and illustrator Robert Crumb. For the small amount of time he is on the screen he really captures the essence of the guy.",5,An offbeat movie about an offbeat kind of man,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,3162,"['really', 'great', 'film', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'underground', 'comic', 'book', 'writer', 'who', 'created', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'American', 'Splendor', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'movie', ""n't"", 'garnered', 'more', 'critical', 'attention', 'movie', 'basically', 'end', 'Harvey', 'second', 'marriage', 'up', 'point', 'retirement', 'file', 'clerk', 'Pekar', 'living', 'life', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'everything', 'life', 'generic', 'film', 'dingy', 'quality', 'Pekar', 'surroundings', 'really', 'garage', 'sale', 'look', 'right', 'down', 'light', 'fixtures', 'apartment', 'Even', 'supermarkets', 'restaurants', 'Harvey', 'frequent', 'make', 'K-mart', 'look', 'classy', 'friends', 'coworkers', 'painfully', 'aware', 'reality', 'life', 'moment', 'clarity', 'one', 'day', 'waiting', 'line', 'grocery', 'store', 'woman', 'who', 'arguing', 'over', 'why', 'should', 'pay', '1.50', 'six', 'glasses', 'are', 'marked', 'two', 'dollars', 'when', 'way', 'strike', 'out', 'document', 'feelings', 'comic', 'Unfortunately', 'Harvey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'draw', 'up', 'narrative', 'only', 'able', 'show', 'stick', 'figures', 'actual', 'characters', 'drawings', 'Harvey', 'big', 'break', 'become', 'friends', 'underground', 'comic', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'Crumb', 'was', 'famous', 'two', 'were', 'just', 'couple', 'ordinary', 'guys', 'looking', 'bargains', 'Cleveland', 'rummage', 'sales', 'Crumb', 'impressed', 'statement', 'Harvey', 'trying', 'make', 'agrees', 'do', 'illustrations', 'thus', 'comic', 'American', 'Splendor', 'born.To', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'love', 'story', 'Harvey', 'third', 'wife', 'Joyce', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'weird', 'enough', 'make', 'work', 'What', 'work', 'have', 'staked', 'out', 'own', 'individual', 'claims', 'different', 'enough', 'territories', 'land', 'weird', 'respective', 'neuroses', 'do', ""n't"", 'bump', 'one', 'too', 'badly', 'had', 'happened', 'Harvey', 'past', 'marriages', 'Harvey', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'un-mundane', 'statements', 'make', 'mundane', 'world', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'illusions', 'changing', 'Joyce', 'self-diagnosed', 'depressed', 'anemic', 'who', 'memorized', 'DSM', '3', 'therefore', 'happy', 'diagnose', 'people', 'personality', 'disorders', 'then', 'pretty', 'much', 'spite', 'claims', 'being', 'reformer', 'one', 'change', 'other', 'relationship', 'works.The', 'film', 'really', 'cleverly', 'done', 'comic', 'book', 'illustrations', 'showing', 'what', 'Pekar', 'thinking', 'various', 'situations', 'narration', 'couple', 'interviews', 'actual', 'Pekar', 'wife', 'interspersed', 'film', 'giving', 'real', 'feeling', 'authenticity', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'caustic', 'warts', 'more', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'How', 'often', 'do', 'see', 'actor', 'share', 'screen', 'person', 'playing', 'happens', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'notice', 'blip', 'continuity', 'performance', 'good', 'Giamatti', 'certainly', 'better', 'playing', 'supporting', 'roles', 'films', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'Kudos', 'also', 'James', 'Urbaniak', 'small', 'role', 'artist', 'illustrator', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'small', 'amount', 'time', 'screen', 'really', 'essence', 'guy']",American Splendor

From leading roles in this and Sideways, to a supporting role in Cinderella Man, he's showed greatness in variety. Of those roles the role in American Splendor was probably the toughest, because he had to play someone so unlike anyone else ever in a movie, in a movie so unlike any movie that I've ever seen. It's a biopic based on a true story, and so much more.Harvey Pekar, played by Giomatti, is a frustrated, obsessive compulsive, secluded personality, whose meeting with legendary underground comic Robert Crumb causes him to get interested in writing, but not drawing, a series of comics, based very much on his life, by the name of American Splendor, that Crumb agrees to draw for. This series leads him to meet Joyce Babner, who he soon marries as both connect with their quirky personalities. More quirky than anyone is Tony Randolff, a self proclaimed nerd, and a plutonic friend of Harvey's. Eventually Pekar goes on David Letterman and makes a fool of himself. Pekar and Joyce deal with medical uncertainties, and eventually adopt a daughter. It's a great story, with great writing in and itself, but it's much more unusual that the typical great movie.What makes this movie so unusual is it jumps between past characters playing the story of Pekar's life, to the present real life characters being themselves in a shooting studio. We can see how honestly the characters are played, unlike most biopics where we trust that the characters are played the way they were or are in life. This is a fun, sometimes dark, and always fascinating look at the life of someone many have never heard of before. Last decade one of my favorite documentaries was Crumb, and so far this decade American Splendor is one of my favorite films period.

I haven't had an opportunity to read Our Cancer Year, a graphic novel by Harvey and his wife Joyce about Harvey's bout with cancer, but that storyline is also incorporated into this movie.Harvey Pekar, played by Paul Giamatti, leads an ordinary life in the city of Cleveland, working as a file clerk in a VA hospital, divorced twice, scours garage sales and thrift stores for rare Jazz records, is thoroughly well read, and observes the people in his life and his surroundings fairly closely, taking it all in, good and bad.  Harvey does tend to a rather morose individual; so don't come into this movie looking for tales of happiness and joy.  A chance meeting with a greeting card artist and future underground comic legend Robert Crumb develops in to a long-standing friendship through their similar interests.  Once Crumb becomes famous for his unusual style of comic books, Harvey decides he wants to try his hand at it, creating, with the help of Crumb's illustrations, stories about his life titled American Splendor.  No superheroes here, but more of a realistic portrayal of his own life, warts and all.  Soon he develops cult fame, and meets his future wife, Joyce, a comic book storeowner from Delaware.  Harvey's fame manifests itself in a sort of bizarre fashion, leading to a number of appearances on David Letterman's late night talk show, and even trickles down to people he knows and includes in his book, specifically his ultra nerdy co-worker and friend Toby Radloff, played wonderfully by Judah Friedlander.One of the things I really enjoyed about this movie was the inclusion of the real Harvey Pekar and other people in his life, such as his wife, Joyce, and his very odd friend, Toby Radloff.  Harvey does some narration, and appears in a few scenes with other, real life people, who are portrayed by actors in the movie, in scenes between the scenes, if that makes sense.  It allows for a comparison between the actors playing the characters and the real life people those characters are based on.  It sounds like it would be a little disjointed, but directors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini pull it off wonderfully.  What was most interesting to me was how much Paul Giamatti got into the character of Harvey, from physical appearance, speech, dress, attitude, and even mannerisms.  Sometimes I wasn't sure if I was watching Paul Giamatti's Harvey Pekar or the real Harvey Pekar.  One of my favorite scenes is one where Harvey discusses the peculiarity of his name, and how odd it was that he found a couple of other people in the phonebook who shared his name.Presented in a wide screen format, the movie looks great.  Also included are a plethora of extras, including a reprint of a comic insert Harvey Pekar created for Entertainment Weekly, a group commentary including the real Harvey Pekar, a featurette, and a few hidden items that aren't too hard to find.

At first glance, the everyday events of a file clerk from Cleveland seem hardly the material for an interesting film. Fortunately, filmmakers Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman are able to take what was funny, heart-breaking and fascinating about Pekar's life and successfully adapt from the panels on the page to the big screen. Like Ghost World , American Splendor champions outsiders who don't fit in with mainstream society.In a nice touch, a mini-comic book comes with the DVD that briefly chronicles Pekar's experience with having his comic book adapted into a movie.The disc itself features an engaging audio commentary with the real Harvey Pekar, his wife Joyce, their daughter Danielle, his friend Toby Radloff, filmmakers Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman, and actor Paul Giamatti. Everyone has a lot of fun on this track as they joke and reminiscence about the film and their experiences.""Road to Splendor"" is a brief update on what Harvey has been up to since the film was made.The song, ""American Splendor,"" by Eytan Mirsky that was featured in the movie can be listened to in its entirety. His vocals sound uncannily like Evan Dando from the Lemonheads.Finally, there is a theatrical trailer for the movie.American Splendor has the same ironic sense of humour and melancholy as Ghost World, another excellent cinematic adaptation of an independent comic book. American Splendor stays true to Pekar's vision-it refuses to sentimentalize his life, even at the film's emotional conclusion which is genuinely moving. It is one of the finest comic book adaptations ever put on film because it remains true to its source material and wisely involves its creator in the process of transferring his story from the page to the screen.",5,An excellent comic book adaptation a la Ghost World.,1076284800,"02 9, 2004",2004,1853,"['Harvey', 'Pekar', 'comic', 'book', 'American', 'Splendor', 'pioneered', 'new', 'genre', 'autobiographical', 'comic', 'book', 'first', 'glance', 'everyday', 'events', 'file', 'clerk', 'Cleveland', 'seem', 'hardly', 'material', 'interesting', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'filmmakers', 'Robert', 'Pulcini', 'Shari', 'Springer', 'Berman', 'are', 'able', 'take', 'what', 'was', 'funny', 'heart-breaking', 'fascinating', 'Pekar', 'life', 'successfully', 'adapt', 'panels', 'page', 'big', 'screen', 'Ghost', 'World', 'American', 'Splendor', 'champions', 'outsiders', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'mainstream', 'society.In', 'nice', 'touch', 'mini-comic', 'book', 'DVD', 'briefly', 'Pekar', 'experience', 'having', 'comic', 'book', 'adapted', 'movie.The', 'disc', 'engaging', 'audio', 'commentary', 'real', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'wife', 'Joyce', 'daughter', 'Danielle', 'friend', 'Toby', 'Radloff', 'filmmakers', 'Robert', 'Pulcini', 'Shari', 'Springer', 'Berman', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Everyone', 'lot', 'fun', 'track', 'joke', 'reminiscence', 'film', 'experiences', 'Road', 'Splendor', 'brief', 'update', 'what', 'Harvey', 'been', 'up', 'film', 'was', 'made.The', 'song', 'American', 'Splendor', 'Eytan', 'Mirsky', 'was', 'featured', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'listened', 'entirety', 'vocals', 'sound', 'uncannily', 'Evan', 'Dando', 'Lemonheads.Finally', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'movie.American', 'Splendor', 'same', 'ironic', 'sense', 'humour', 'melancholy', 'Ghost', 'World', 'excellent', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'independent', 'comic', 'book', 'American', 'Splendor', 'true', 'Pekar', 'vision-it', 'refuses', 'sentimentalize', 'life', 'even', 'film', 'emotional', 'conclusion', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'one', 'finest', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'true', 'source', 'material', 'wisely', 'creator', 'process', 'transferring', 'story', 'page', 'screen']",American Splendor

You eke out an anonymous existence in ratty apartments at a clerk job at the V.A. hospital, submit ideas for stories about your seemingly mundane life (you can bearly draw a straight line)for an underground comic book and they make a classic movie about you.  Harvey Pekar is one lucky fellow that the task of making the movie of his life was left to the gifted directors Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman.Pulcini and Berman imaginatively tell Harvey's story through interesting devices such as through traditional actors, actual participation by the real-life counterparts themselves or through cartoon panels.  At one point in the film the real Harvey Pekar is talking and you can see the actor playing him, Paul Giamatti, laughing in the background.  Normally this would be a daunting task for an actor to have the real-life person appear in the same film as you but Giamatti is such a consummate actor that he is more than up to the task.  Also providing excellent work here are Hope Davis as Harvey's soulmate, Joyce, and Judah Friedlander as Toby, a nerdy co-worker(and proud of it)of Harvey's.  The grimy Cleveland locations also add to the feel of the film as do the use of vintage records on the soundtrack(probably obscure jazz records from Harvey's personal collection).  In a perfect world this film should have enjoyed greater box office acceptance than it did like, say, a lesser independent film like ""Napoleon Dynamite"".  I have attempted to recommend this film to other people and it's usually met with a shrug.  When I attempt to explain what the film is about it's usually met with puzzled uninterested looks.

783932,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,B0000U0X20,David Bonesteel,"[6, 6]","Disgruntled file clerk and social misfit Harvey Pekar (Paul Giamatti) lucks into a degree of fame, if not fortune, when underground comics legend Robert Crumb (James Urbaniak) collaborates with him on a comic about his life.  Pekar lives in a state of existential misery, desperately lonely and angry about his outsider status.  His comics, though, make him a kind of hero to average suffering folks and even bring him a little family by the end of the film (his wife, Joyce Brabner, is wonderfully played by Hope Davis).  We are left with the sense that life never has and never will be smooth sailing for Pekar, but the struggle has its own worth and nobility and, in the end, will bring you more than mere surrender ever will.  This may be a rather sweet, conventional message for a film that aims to be so subversive and counter-cultural, but it is reassuring all the same.Writer/directors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini employ a mix of animation, documentary and bio-pic conventions to relate their story, with varying degrees of success.  Showing excerpts of Harvey's actual appearances on the David Letterman Show instead of recreating them with actors is a stroke of genius and I appreciated the unapologetic, direct way these sequences were handled: we see Paul Giamatti waiting in the wings, followed by a cut to the real Harvey walking out onto the stage.  At other times, such as having the real Harvey comment on the actor chosen to play him, it seems somewhat contrived and echoes a complaint that he makes during the film of having been co-opted by the system.All in all, a very entertaining, interesting film with wonderful performances.

Amazing, how a man can simultaneously embody the American Dream of fame and herodom, and the quiet desperation of everyday life.""American Splendor"" tells the tale of such a man perhaps in the only way to do him justice - by any means necessary. It's mostly told with actors, but sometimes we get to meet the real Harvey and his friends and family. Sometimes we see some crude but effective animation. Sometimes everything is mixed together. The amazing thing is that the approach never seems gimmicky or self-conscious - it seems honest. There's never a moment during Paul Giamatti's astounding portrayal of Harvey that we doubt his authenticity, and we aren't disoriented in the least when the real Harvey shows up.The Harvey Pekar story, as told in ""American Splendor,"" is deeply moving. Here's a guy with a soul but a bleak outlook, one who is cursed to see the futility and inanity of his own existence. What separates him from so many of his bretheren, though, and quite possibly saves his life, is that he finds an outlet when he chooses to document his life in comic-book form. One one hand, this decision leads to his status as an underground hero, Letterman regular, and movie subject. On another, his life doesn't get any better, even though he manages, amazingly, to find a wife who pretty much understands him, and a child who seems to be his match.Harvey is difficult but impossible to dislike. You stick with him, even when he's being insufferable. That's true of the other characters in his life, played to perfection by Hope Davis as his wife, and Judah Friedlander as his ubernerd friend Toby. These are people who matter, and they deserve their voices, and ""American Splendor"" lets them speak, with enormously entertaining results.I love movies like ""American Splendor.""

So, as someone who did not like it, my contribution here will be to help those of you who may find yourself similarly inclined to realize that this movie may just not be for you, or at least to encourage you to rent it first.This will not be a diatribe.  This movie was not truly offensive, at least not, let's say, in the way ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" might be offensive.  It is not poorly acted or cast, having excellent performances that one can only imagine capture the essence of the characters portrayed very well (it is entertaining though to muse for just a moment that perhaps Pekar is a character of his own invention, a well concocted ruse deliberately intended to appeal to a particular group of viewers).  It is not a low-budget, poorly composed, poorly directed or edited movie and displays production values in keeping with the most expensive Hollywood productions.  So why not recommend it?American Splendor gives us a ""day in the life"" view of a character that some of us may find amusing or even appealing, but others may find simply boring or even loathsome.  Pekar himself appears to be a man in search of a lack of meaning in life, the kind of person who goes through all things with his eyes firmly routed on the sidewalk.  While being pitiful in his own way, Pekar is not an underdog.  He does not inspire hope or create any feelings of pathos or empathy, and instead seems to simply wallow in self-pity.  There is no deep underlying message here (not a requirement, but something you often see in a movie like this... something to justify watching it).  Pekar continually mopes through life, ignoring everything uplifting and hopeful around him.  There is no contrast here, no change, no growth, no moving on... .  There is just Pekar, living his life as if doing so in and of itself were enough.So, it's not so much that the movie lacks technical merit, but that the subject lacks any ability to connect, at least for me.  We all differ.  For me though, having to watch someone relentlessly ignore incredible opportunities and to look through all the good and wonderful people and things around him only to seek out the gray, the negative, and the depressing... is ... well... depressing.  This is not the story of one man's struggle in any way, but actually his absolute refusal to struggle, even to try at all to either make life better or even accept the good around him.

783936,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B0000U0X20,Douglas King,"[2, 2]","This movie is wonderful. It manages to be both stylistically daring and genuinely touching. Harvey Pekar is such a fantastic protagonist because he's so heartbreakingly ordinary. Lonely, overwhelmed, unlucky in love and stuck in a dead-end job, Harvey decides to turn his humdrum life into a comic book, and ends up becoming a cultural icon that ordinary people everywhere can relate to. His romance and marriage to Joyce is one of the most touching and heartwarming screen romances I've seen in a long time. And when Harvey inadvertently becomes a television celebrity by becoming a regular on the David Letterman Show, he quickly finds himself disgusted by the whole charade and sabotages it (the scene with Pekar having a disturbing on-air argument with Letterman is one of the most intense scenes in the film).

783938,AY1HVIM2V067E,B0000U0X20,"Edward G. Nilges ""Author, 'Build Your Own .Ne...","[2, 3]","American culture proceeds by widening a circle of inclusion as opposed to demarcation; this has a material basis in the search for new content.Thus, the normed American family of the early American &quot;situation comedy&quot; was white and middle class but pure market forces exhausted this theme just in time for the civil rights movement to simultaneously confront American government with an overdue bill and American media with a new market and new themes.However, in a manner parallel to the way in which enormous and ugly-when-new factories became sarcophagi in places like Harvey Pekar's Cleveland, Harvey Pekar's American Splendor comics showed how people's lives in the Rust Belt also became sarcophagi on boulevards of broken dreams.In fact, precisely because Pekar focused on marginality, and narrates and centers his own marginalization, we'd do well to &quot;read&quot; American Center on its own margin.This means paying less attention to his attractive and engaging wife Joyce (who in the DVD comes across well as played) and more to the least attractive figure in the DVD, a &quot;nerd&quot; who lives with his grandmother and has a variety of tics.When the &quot;nerd&quot; supposes he sees himself reflected in the 1980s film Revenge of the Nerds, Harvey produces a brilliant deconstruction of the film. It is reminiscent of the way in which Saul Bellow's hero in Bellow's short story &quot;How Was Your Day?&quot; is obscurely angry at his girlfriend when she likes M.A.S.H., a Seventies film.Bellow's hero is angry because as an Adorno clone, he feels that M.A.S.H. painted over &quot;suffering&quot;, which is also Harvey's focus and which goes against an American grain. Pekar is angry at Toby because, as Pekar correctly points out, Toby isn't even a &quot;nerd&quot;.Toby, as Pekar points out, lives with his grandparents, probably because the destruction of the physical environment of the Rust Belt was responsible for physical and mental dysfunction strong enough to destroy families. Toby, as Pekar points out, bought his computer with coupons and $149.00 (much as I bought a Sinclair mail order from the UK in 1980 and nearly set our house on fire because the &quot;American&quot; adapter started a fire).As Joyce points out in the DVD, what Adorno called damage is the norm and it goes &quot;up&quot; (or, perhaps in a real moral order, down) to David Letterman.The problem is that the media is the message.For genuine and practical reasons, Pekar struggled for years as a writer and critic to break out of the marginal ghetto that is represented by comics and into a more renumerative line of work such as movies; but for the simple reason that movies are a social art they reflect, more so than comics, the wider society.Unfortunately, the laissez-faire narrative of the wider society, the American dream as it were, is that American culture has the Manifest Destiny to expand into a vacuum. The &quot;nerd&quot; thereby gets his revenge only by co-optation and by being made a celebrant.Precisely when Harvey got serious on Letterman, Letterman of course turned on him, and as shown in the movie, invited him, absurdly, to buy his own television network to air his pro-union views.The &quot;system&quot; cannot be changed from within and what this means is that only when it encounters an external check, up to and tragically including September 11, will it change.In the run up to the assault on Iraq, Cheney said &quot;the American lifestyle is not negotiable&quot;. American Splendor as a comic and now as a movie shows that for at least twenty years and at least since Reagan's election, it has been quite negotiable for most Americans, including the preponderance of working people with no health insurance and many other working people who live like Toby with relatives or in motels.Furthermore, it isn't even American anymore. We need to realize that George F. Kennan's essay of 1948, in which Kennan said that our policy goal needs to be preservation of our lifestyle, was obscene as was the marginalization of George Marshall after Marshall showed that the only way to preserve it is to extend it and, in some measure, give it away.Thus in China, the ""American"" lifestyle is not ""American"", just a decent future which the leadership starting with Deng Xiao Peng realized people wanted and which the leadership to its credit tried to foster by managing market forces...in a way that is impossible under laissez faire, and in a Long March towards laissez-faire, which replaces the false reality with the goal.But Back in the USA, Americans have been invited to believe that they already live in Paradise and, if they are in any way discontent, to self-marginalize.In the central narrative they are invited to find the reason for their marginalization in psychological disorder renarrated as defects of character, since it's convenient to ignore a physical basis, especially if this would implicate corporate polluters.However, the DVD ends, not by any fault of Pekar's, as an inclusive, American celebration.&quot;The revolution will not be televised&quot;. Bob Crumb, the great cartoonist, has tried to exit the all-inclusive situation comedy repeatedly and now lives in France. Pekar, in a more tragic tradition, that of Judaism and the narrative of emigration, looks forward only to a well-deserved and reasonably comfortable retirement.But those of us with children need an American narrative in which the best of those children is not marginalized and in which their worst, Letterman-like characteristics don't form the ground of ""success"".In other words, there must be some way out of this place.",4,Narrative of marginality,1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,5643,"['American', 'culture', 'proceeds', 'widening', 'circle', 'inclusion', 'opposed', 'demarcation', 'material',

It's based on a true story and sometimes feels like half documentary and half movie because it switches from the actor playing the main character to the real ""Harvey Pekar"" (the underground comic book writer of ""American Splendor"").  The movie also shows the real people in Harvey's life and then switches back to the actors playing them.  It uses a lot of comic book drawings and animation in the film too.Harvey Pekar, (played by Paul Giamatti), is a frustrated file clerk at a V.A. Hospital that eventually is inspired to create comic books based on his own life.  He is a grouchy and depressed working-class everyman type of guy.  He eventually meets and marries ""Joyce"", (played by Hope Davis), who is a quirky and sometimes depressed comic book seller.

The comics are done  in  somewhat of a tongue-in-cheek, insightful and some times  a sarcastic style of humor that elevates the boredom and  misery of life to an almost mystical perspective.The film takes us  from his youth, his friendship with R. Crumb, his love of  old Jazz, the relationship with his wife, his day job as a filing clerk at the local hospital VA and  the nuts and bolts of his work as an underground cartoonist where Harvey  where  we see  him writing  the dialogue  and drawing  stick figures that are later elaborated on by  various artists (including Crumb). Also followed in this movie is his sudden success when he is ""discovered"" , his bout with cancer and the adoption of their daughter.It gives a character sketch of someone  to whom life  has not exactly been kind  but we also get the feeling that Pekar has done a good job  sabotaging himself all along the way. You might actually find yourself asking yourself why Pekar  sabotages himself as he does and the answer, if this is a true portrayal of the man, might be  because he suffers from too much integrity.The movie is done in a very creative style with  Paul Giamatti playing Pekar through out the movie with Pekar himself  showing up in and out of the movie in interviews on the set and  film clips of his appearances on the Leterman show as well as some  animation and of course  close ups of  some of the cells of Harvey's comics.The  casting of Giamatti was perfect and the actor  pulls off the portrayal of Pekar  supurbly and with ease.The portrayal of  the blossoming  relationship with his wife is  particularly touching  and is  quite sentimental for a guy who seems to take pride in being anything but sentimental.Pekar finally being recognized as a social critic and artist of merit is taken as a mixed blessing by Harvey in true Pekar fashion and yet Harvey is seen  as  being pulled dragging and kicking through the hype.Whether or not this  indeed a true portrayal of the man  the  Harvey Pekar of this movie come across as being a many of integrity.His struggle with cancer is told with honesty and  in it we see our anti-hero as someone who is quite heroic.A very entertaining movie about a real character.Included  with the DVD is a mini-comic book which I found quite delightful.Jim Connell  ""Hallstatt Prince""",5,The agony and the ecstasy,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,2927,"['movie', 'biography', 'cartoonist', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'who', 'literally', 'turned', 'suffering', 'art', 'form.Pekar', 'lovable', 'curmudgeon', 'who', 'always', 'see', 'impending', 'doom', 'horizon', 'cloud', 'silver', 'lining', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'find', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'be', 'really', 'lovable', 'guy.He', 'lives', 'apartment', 'Cleveland', 'never', 'clean', 'prized', 'collection', 'Jazz', 'records.Pekar', 'cartoons', 'have', 'had', 'cult', 'following', 'while', 'take', 'form', 'autobiography', 'autobiography', 'common', 'man', 'everyman', 'annoyances', 'everyday', 'modern', 'life', 'comics', 'are', 'done', 'somewhat', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'insightful', 'times', 'sarcastic', 'style', 'humor', 'boredom', 'misery', 'life', 'almost', 'mystical', 'perspective.The', 'film', 'youth', 'friendship', 'R.', 'Crumb', 'love', 'old', 'Jazz', 'relationship', 'wife', 'day', 'job', 'filing', 'clerk', 'local', 'hospital', 'VA', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'work', 'underground', 'cartoonist', 'where', 'Harvey', 'where', 'see', 'writing', 'dialogue', 'drawing', 'stick', 'figures', 'are', 'later', 'elaborated', 'various', 'artists', 'including', 'Crumb', 'Also', 'followed', 'movie', 'sudden', 'success', 'when', 'discovered', 'bout', 'cancer', 'adoption', 'daughter.It', 'character', 'sketch', 'someone', 'whom', 'life', 'not', 'exactly', 'been', 'kind', 'also', 'get', 'feeling', 'Pekar', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'sabotaging', 'way', 'might', 'actually', 'find', 'asking', 'why', 'Pekar', 'answer', 'true', 'portrayal', 'man', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'integrity.The', 'movie', 'done', 'very', 'creative', 'style', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'playing', 'Pekar', 'movie', 'Pekar', 'showing', 'up', 'movie', 'interviews', 'set', 'film', 'clips', 'appearances', 'Leterman', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'animation', 'course', 'close', 'ups', 'cells', 'Harvey', 'comics.The', 'casting', 'Giamatti', 'was', 'perfect', 'actor', 'portrayal', 'Pekar', 'supurbly', 'ease.The', 'portrayal', 'blossoming', 'relationship', 'wife', 'particularly', 'touching', 'quite', 'sentimental', 'guy', 'who', 'take', 'pride', 'being', 'anything', 'finally', 'being', 'recognized', 'social', 'critic', 'artist', 'merit', 'taken', 'mixed', 'blessing', 'Harvey', 'true', 'Pekar', 'fashion', 'yet', 'Harvey', 'seen', 'being', 'pulled', 'dragging', 'kicking', 'hype.Whether', 'not', 'indeed', 'true', 'portrayal', 'man', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'movie', 'come', 'being', 'many', 'integrity.His', 'struggle', 'cancer', 'told', 'honesty', 'see', 'anti-hero', 'someone', 'who', 'quite', 'heroic.A', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'real', 'character.Included', 'DVD', 'mini-comic', 'book', 'found', 'quite', 'delightful.Jim', 'Connell', 'Hallstatt', 'Prince']",American Splendor

783945,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B0000U0X20,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[5, 14]","Having just watched Paul Giamatti's acting prowess in Alexander Payne's excellent ""Sideways"" three times, and with Terry Zwigoff's movie ""Ghost World"" (which I must have seen a dozen times already) being a wonderful and quietly tragic movie based on an underground comic book, I was prepared to enjoy a movie that seemed right up my alley.First off: This movie is well made and Giamatti gives a great performance, as does Hope Davis (""About Schmidt""), who plays his wife.However, it doesn't put me in the comic book world any more than, say, ""Remains of the Day"" did. Despite the directors using a number of gimmicks, such as comic strip panels and animation and intercutting scenes with the actual Harvey Pekar (the comic book author upon whom the movie is based) and his wife and nerd co-worker, this movie still put up a wall between itself and me, whereas in ""Ghost World"" I got totally sucked into the atmosphere, as there was much more graphic unity and cohesion with the plot and characters.Another reason is that in ""Ghost World,"" I found it easier to sympathize and empathize with the characters. Not so with Harvey Pekar. Sure, Giamatti's fun to watch, but he doesn't have very good monologue to work with or dialogue. He's sort of similar to Seymour, Steve Buscemi's loner from ""Ghost World"" (and, I have heard, Seymour was based in part on Pekar, a friend of comic illustrator Robert Crumb). Unlike Seymour, however, Pekar has few redeeming qualities.The harrowing misfortune of living with depression aside, I've never seen such a bitter and negative character like Pekar. On the DVD packaging, he's billed as a ""curmudgeon,"" so I was expecting him to be an intelligent cynic with ascerbic wit, sort of a modern-day H.L. Mencken or Mark Twain.But Pekar never really does more than grunt about not wanting to look on the brighter side of life, because that's ""Hollywood BS."" The most intellectual he gets is when he's a guest on ""Late Night with David Letterman"" for the fifth time or so, when he accuses Letterman of being a sellout, because his show is on NBC, and NBC is owned by General Electric, a company that makes weapons systems. That's his great big revelation? Would be perhaps had I not heard it out of the mouths of John Cusack and Tim Robbins many times before.Basically, Pekar's shtick is chronicling his commonplace, everyday life. Mind you, not finding something beautiful and unique about it, just giving his readers something that's ""real,"" not like the ""Hollywood BS"" he so disdains.His stories revolve around his job as a file clerk at the Veterans Administration hospital in Cleveland, trips to the supermarket, etc. At the hospital, we run into a handful of his oddball co-workers, but not much else. His journey to the express lane while getting trapped behind a kvetching woman with a handful of coupons is cute, but not terribly novel. From Pekar, I get the feeling of a recycled Andy Rooney monologue: ""Did you ever notice that... (fill in the blank)?""Except even Rooney used voice inflection to try to actually interest his audience, as does Giamatti. Had the directors left Giamatti alone to perform the role, maybe I'd not be down on Pekar so much. But, by writing the real Pekar into the script, they sabotage anything Giamatti has done to make him marginally sympathetic, interesting or intelligent.The real Pekar comes off as sort of a non-entity at best, and a grouch complaining about meaningless trivial inconveniences at worst.  He's (dare I say it?) a bore! A self-absorbed and emptyheaded bore!Thus we are left bereft, empty of any inspiration whatsoever, the victims of a false advertising campaign. There's no ""splenor"" at all to his self-loathing and negativity. Pekar is basically a man so nihilistic, he'd make Nietzsche blush.But, unlike Nietzsche, Pekar has negated even the possibility of there being any Uebermenschen, heroes, or even good and interesting people.Want proof of how Harvey Pekar's life has been a mostly wasted life (based upon what's presented in this film, at least)? Here it is: He worked at the V.A. Hospital in Cleveland long enough to earn a retirement party. That's a pretty huge chunk taken out of his life.Have you ever been to a V.A. Hospital? It's a ready-made central casting of a novel (or comic book) of epic proportions: So many aging soldiers, Marines, sailors and airmen, and they've all got stories to tell. Tales of daring exploits and understated, modest, disclaimers of any heroism at all. At his fingertips, any time he wanted to lunch with them at the cafteria or share a coffee at the canteen, he could have given the world a treasure trove of stories of our many heroes, a few cowards, some braggarts, a few saints and quite a few sinners.He could have opened up to the rest of us the world of the forgotten veterans too poor to go anywhere else but the V.A. hospital; of American Legion members who go there rather than their private docs, just to chew the fat and share old war stories with their fellow comrades; of the ancient guy sitting outside the entrance in his wheelchair, using a few of his last precious breaths to suck in nicotine, while smoking a Camel through his tracheostomy tube; the heartbreak of lonely old homeless vets, who've no family in the world, and who are just waiting to die.Oddly, we meet none of these colorful types. Harvey Pekar is too busy staring at file cabinet drawers, complaining about the length of lines at the store and gazing at his own navel to look beyond to see a grand and glorious world outside of himself.But, of course, Pekar's world precludes the very existence of  such people as heroes, and the wars they fought and won were nothing more than ""Hollywood BS.""I do recommend ""American Splendor"" as a rental, so that viewers can watch some good performances as well as competent color timing, sound editing and film splicing.""American Splendor"" is the antithesis of ""It's A Wonderful Life"": It unintentionally answers the question ""would the world have been better off without Harvey Pekar?"" with ""well, it really doesn't matter. Maybe, maybe not. Who knows?""But, of course, any other answer would have been more of the same, phoney ""Hollywood BS.""",3,"I, Me, Mine",1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,6199,"['Having', 'just', 'watched', 'Paul',

The acerbic comic author here offers the audience exactly what makes his comic of the same name so special, a window into the life of the every man, with all the pain and foibles that go with it.  Pekar's searing honesty of his own problems and triumphs, non extraordinary perhaps on a global sale but all amazing on the personal level, give his audience a keen window of what it means to be an average person struggling to make it buy.All of the performances here are excellent, though Giamatti and Davis deserve special mention for their wonderful portrayals.  They bring these people to life.  The director's interesting technique of placing Pekar as a commentator on his own life keeps the film from slipping into melodrama and keeping the distance that gives the comic is powerful perspective.  Harvey's humor is much here in evidence, even when his life dips towards tragedy and that is the rock on which this excellent film rests.

But it's not nearly as strange or sad I expected, it's actually quite funny and surprisingly straight-forward. I'd never heard of American Splendor before, but after watching the movie the first thing I did was rush out to buy the book. Paul Giametti and Hope Davis are both excellent and the real life Harvey Pekar and Joyce Brabner are also wonderful to watch.  This movie turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen this year. This movie is a combination of a docudrama and a black comedy. Wickedly funny and very different. While other docudramas try to blend the actors and the real-life footage seemlessly, that's not done here. You totally accept the actor playing Harvey, the real Harvey, all the different cartoon Harvey's and the actor playing the actor Harvey, as being Harvey Pekar. In one scene, the real Harvey narates as the actor Harvey goes to see a play about his life, in which another actor plays the actor Harvey. Whew! And the real Harvey narrates about how weird it is to be watching the &quot;movie&quot; of this scene. In another scene, you can't believe Harvey and Toby are as weird as they seem, until the actors walk out of the movie onto the set, and you see the real Harvey and Toby interacting, and the actors are watching them. And then you realize that not only did the actors really &quot;nail them&quot; but the real guys are perhaps even weirder than they are portrayed. Joyce and Harvey's &quot;date&quot; is hysterical. All the scenes in the movie are framed like frames from the comic book. Very creative. And in the end, it all comes full circle, when Harvey writes a comic book about making the movie. It has been a long time since I have seen such a smart, engaging, moving, spryly written, wryly funny movie. You absolutely do not need to be aware of his work before seeing the movie, though if you are a fan, I am sure it would be all the more enjoyable.

783950,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0000U0X20,Joe Sherry,"[0, 3]","A film by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini""American Splendor"" is a rather peculiar movie, though a fairly good one.  ""American Splendor"" is about the life and times of Harvey Pekar.  Harvey is not the sort of man you would ordinarily expect to have a movie made about, Harvey is also the author of the comic book of the same title.  ""American Splendor"", the comic, is not your usual kind of comic.  There are no superheroes and nobody wears a spandex bodysuit.  The comic is about real life: specifically the real life of Harvey Pekar himself.  This movie is an adaptation of the comic, so it is a film about a comic about a real man.  With that in mind, ""American Splendor"" mixes several styles of film narrative.  We have the basic story of Harvey Pekar's life, but the story is actually narrated by the real Harvey Pekar who acknowledges when Harvey (Paul Giamatti) appears on screen ""That's me.""  Then he goes on to say that it is only an actor playing him and that they don't really look alike.  Since this is a movie based on a comic, we also get pauses where the film switches to a comic book frame (or moves from the frame into a scene), which works rather well in this film (in comparison to ""The Hulk"", which did not work quite as well as it did here).  There is also a documentary style to the film as it moves from a movie scene to the real Harvey and the real Joyce being interviewed.  While these styles, perhaps, should not work in the film, they do and rather well at that.The film truly begins (there is a scene before this with a young Harvey) with Harvey getting dumped by his second wife.  This sends him into a funk, but he meets a man named Crumb who is a talented artist and eventually becomes successful and famous.  When Crumb visits Harvey a couple of years later Harvey has the idea for writing a new style of comic book, one about the ordinary, day to day stuff (this was revolutionary at the time) and Crumb decides to do the artwork for the book.  It is called ""American Splendor"" and despite being a critical success and an underground favorite it does not permit Harvey to leave his job as a file clerk.What the comic does give Harvey, other than some limited acclaim, is that it is the impetuous for Joyce (Hope Davis) to write Harvey and eventually meet and marry him.  They have a rather strange relationship, and though it may not be based on love, it seems to work (both in the film's story as well as in the documentary portions).  We trace Harvey's life through his co-workers (an interesting cast of characters), through his appearances on the David Letterman show (where we see the actual footage, but when Harvey steps off the stage it switches over to the film Harvey again), through his year of cancer and up through the present.This was a surprisingly interesting film, and it worked more successfully than I expected.  It will not make my list of top ten films, but it was good and had some excellent performances (Giamatti should have been recognized by Oscar for this one).  I'll recommend this one with the ""Good stuff"" rating.

It's a film about a very dysfunctional man, living a sub par existence, who, upon realizing that he wanted to leave an indelible mark on the world much as his friend did with the Crumb strips, reached down and found something to comment on. What did he comment on? Everyday circumstances in the dysfunctional world he lived in. ""Everyman"" is your average man. Harvey Pekar was far from average.That said, this was a terrific film. Giammati was amazing as Pekar, and really captured his essence on film. And if we wondered how well he did so, the film showed us the real Harvey Pekar, and the real people that surrounded him. And the real people that surrounded him were sensationally dysfunctional. Yet amidst this lack of functionality, Pekar somehow *did* leave an indelible mark. Many admired him for his writing, but for as many people that admired him for his writing, the same amount - or more - found fun in mocking him. Let's face it - David Letterman had him on his show for comedic effect, and nothing else. Pekar was nothing more to him than a ""stupid pet trick"", and when Pekar finally told Letterman off I applauded.In the early parts of the film I wasn't sure whether or not I liked the back and forth of the ""fictional"" world - the film world - and the real world: the real Harvey Pekar and his band of dysfunctional compatriots. As I watched, however, I grew to appreciate it. I knew that if the real life segments hadn't been included, I would have second-guessed the film. How could someone really live such a disastrous existence and make a name for himself? It seems implausible. Yet it happened. And, as I said, if not for the real life segments, it would have been difficult to imagine.I was so pleasantly surprised to see all of the real life characters represented so accurately. Rarely does a film do this. A typical Hollywood film would have had someone much more attractive than Giammati playing Pekar, and thank god this wasn't a typical Hollywood film. This brought us into his world, into his house, into his mind, into his soul.Frankly, while Giammati is receiving well deserved accolades for his performance in Sideways, this was the defining performance of his career.",4,An accuracy uncommon in Hollywood,1108339200,"02 14, 2005",2005,2262,"[""n't"", 'everyman', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'commented', 'film', 'very', 'dysfunctional', 'man', 'living', 'sub', 'par', 'existence', 'who', 'realizing', 'wanted', 'leave', 'indelible', 'mark', 'world', 'much', 'friend', 'did', 'Crumb', 'strips', 'reached', 'down', 'found', 'something', 'comment', 'What', 'did', 'comment', 'Everyday', 'circumstances', 'dysfunctional', 'world', 'lived', 'Everyman', 'average', 'man', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'was', 'far', 'average.That', 'said', 'was', 'terrific', 'film', 'Giammati', 'was', 'amazing', 'Pekar', 'really', 'captured', 'essence', 'film', 'wondered', 'how', 'well', 'did', 'so', 'film', 'showed', 'real', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'real', 'people', 'surrounded', 'real', 'people', 'surrounded', 'were', 'sensationally', 'dysfunctional', 'amidst', 'lack', 'functionality', 'Pekar', 'somehow', '*did*', 'leave', 'indelible', 'mark', 'Many', 'admired', 'writing', 'as', 'many', 'people', 'admired', 'writing', 'same', 'amount', 'more', 'found', 'fun', 'mocking', 'Let', 'face', 'David', 'Letterman', 'had', 'show', 'comedic', 'effect', 'nothing', 'else', 'Pekar', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'stupid', 'pet', 'trick', 'when', 'Pekar', 'finally', 'told', 'Letterman', 'applauded.In', 'early', 'parts', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'not', 'liked', 'back', 'forth', 'fictional', 'world', 'film', 'world', 'real', 'world', 'real', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'band', 'dysfunctional', 'compatriots', 'watched', 'however', 'grew', 'appreciate', 'knew', 'real', 'life', 'segments', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'included', 'would', 'have', 'second-guessed', 'film', 'How', 'could', 'someone', 'really', 'live', 'such', 'disastrous', 'existence', 'make', 'name', 'implausible', 'happened', 'said', 'not', 'real', 'life', 'segments', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'imagine.I', 'was', 'so', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'characters', 'represented', 'so', 'accurately', 'Rarely', 'film', 'do', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'someone', 'much', 'more', 'attractive', 'Giammati', 'playing', 'Pekar', 'thank', 'god', 'was', ""n't"", 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'brought', 'world', 'house', 'mind', 'soul.Frankly', 'Giammati', 'receiving', 'well', 'deserved', 'accolades', 'performance', 'Sideways', 'was', 'defining', 'performance', 'career']",American Splendor

The movie is basically a Biopic of the creative life of the comic book writer Harvey Pekar, who rose to prominence in the comic book world by putting himself in his comic books and complaining about ho life sucked to be normal.  Sorry if this spoils it for you, but at least you now don't have to see this movie.  Frankly I've had more entertaining experiences at the dentist.  I'm normally a big fan of small, non-Hollywood movies, but I also like my movies to have a plot, a theme or for the love of god, something happening.  American Splendor merely recounts a life that's in turns dull, amusing, heartbreaking and sad.  It is retold by the awful device of having the real Harvey Pekar occasionally interviewed and occasionally narrating, with some horrible ""out-takes"" of him between narrations, a comic book Harvey Pekar between some scenes, and the wonderful Paul Giamatti acting out certain scenes from this bleak and dreary life.  Yes I understand that life is grim and it sucks to be alive and all, but this movie really has nothing else to say, no hope, no real irony, no commentary on the human condition, just as series of painfully slow twists and turns in this sadly forgettable life.  If you are a fan of Harvey Pekar, you'll probably enjoy seeing this.  If you've never heard of him you'll get a kick from seeing him on Letterman, if you smoke then realize that every cigarette takes a minute off your life and life is short and you should spend the few minutes you have left doing anything other than watching this mournful piece of drivel.

I had read the comic books, never thought much of them, but I didn't realize until seeing the movie that Harvey and his wife are genuinely heroic.  In the heartland, American cities are falling apart, and yet Harvey and Joyce still try to maintain Bohemian individuality, the sort that backfires on them like dynamite jammed up a Chevy muffler.On the down side, what bad wigs were planted on the heads of the poor actors who are essaying R. Crumb and Joyce Brabner.  The Crumb guy I didn't recognize, but Brabner is played by Hope Davis, who you always see in this kind of movie except usually she's playing the sort of WASP princess second-rate roles that Gwyneth Paltrow, one assumes, has turned down.  Here she gets a meaty, anti-Hope role and really sinks her teeth into it.  She turns Joyce into a caricature of a hideous lady, the sort whose every word is like fingernails screeching on a blackboard.  But Harvey has been so starved for human companionship, that he falls in love with her over the phone without even meeting her.Joyce gets excited about going to Jerusalem to make a political comic book, but we never find out what happened with that.  To me, she seemed just eager to get out of Cleveland, and the film hints that she couldn't stand to be around her husband.  Thus when Harvey discovers he had cancer, she is nowhere to be found.  I guess it was testicular cancer?  Anyhow he discovers it by reading in bed with one hand scratching inside his boxer shorts.  Maybe it was just crabs.  Anyway they are both disgusting, and the movie comes out with a foresquare anti-cancer, anti-being alone message.  Oddly enough through some sleight of hand that they don't really explain, presumably for legal reasons, the Pekars wind up bringing up a cute blond daughter called Danielle, who looks a lot like the little actress who played Reggie on Showtime's cancelled series DEAD LIKE ME.  Paul Giamatti took the leap from this movie, to SIDEWAYS, to CINDERELLA MAN, to this week's controversial failure, LADY IN THE WATER, each time his salary growing exponentially.

The film American Splendor is evidence that a group of devoted readers did read this comic book with the same name as the film.  The cult figure Robert Crumb, who is known for Felix the Cat, illustrated Pekar's stories, which at the time only had stick figures and no public interest.  Together Pekar and Crumb brought Pekar's life into the world of comics as an anti-heroic comic book, which essentially uses ordinary people around Pekar that emphasizes their unique talents in a superhuman manner.The film depicts a semi-documentary, which brings humor, drama, tragedy, and whatever else life has to offer to the silver screen through the personification of Harvey Pekar.  A combination between Paul Giamatti, who does a brilliant job performing as Pekar, and Harvey, himself, who frequently presents himself adds texture to the story.  This double performance enhances the story as it brings a dual image of Harvey, the personal depiction, as well as an outsider's perspective of Harvey's identity.  Intriguingly it brings out several layers Pekar's life and his idiosyncrasies as he struggles with testicular cancer, divorce, loneliness, and his hobbies.The films ordinarily depiction of an odd character is unique as it develops into an interesting character study of a real character.  It is sad.  It is funny.  It is depressing.  It is warm.  It is touching.  It is grotesque.  However, life is all these things, and this is Harvey Pekar's life.

783958,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000U0X20,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","I have a tendency to embrace films that celebrate post-modernism in a creative way, which is exactly what &quot;American Splendor&quot; does in telling the story of Harvey Pekar, the legendary writer of the underground comic of the same name.  Once upon a time, in the 1970s in fact, Pekar met the equally legendary comic book artist R. Crumb and complained that comic books were never about ordinary schleps like him.  The idea appealed to Crumb, and thus wa born &quot;American Splendor,&quot; written by Pekar and illustrated by Crumb and others.  In this 2003 film written and directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini we are treated to not only a cinematic depiction of Pekar (Paul Giamatti), but of the man himself and the comic book version as well (sometimes at the same time).  This makes sense because the film is about both Pekar's life and his comic book, and the comic book was about his life, so moving back and forth between the two would be the way to go.  What else would you expect from a film, which is art, about life imitating art (and visa versa).Pekar's life is a curious combination of pessimism and honesty.  We are not surprised when he never gets promoted at work or when he gets testicular cancer because this seems to be the lot life has given Pekar.  However, we are surprised when a fan who works at a comic book store, Joyce Brabner (Hope Davis), makes contact with him hoping he has an extra copy of an issue of &quot;American Splendor&quot; that she missed.  She comes for a visit, curious to see which version of Pekar in the comic book is most like the real one.  His immediate reaction is to tell her, &quot;You might as well know right off the bat, I had a vasectomy.&quot;  Her response later in their date, after a severe attack of food poisioning, is to announce, &quot;I think we should skip the whole courtship thing and just get married.&quot;This is my kind of love story.If we are not sure that Harvey and Joyce are made for each other, their ability to coexist is confirmed when the real Harvey and Joyce comment on the proceedings in the film.  Giamatti and Davis both achieve the level of performance where they are simply inhabiting the characters, which is the best way of making them real.  That is important, because there is no more of a sense of plot to &quot;American Splendor&quot; the movie than there was to &quot;American Splendor&quot; the comic book.  Pekar's life is a series of clashes, sometimes with David Letterman on late night television, sometimes with the other people at the hospital where he is a file clerk, and sometimes with himself.The great irony is that underground comic books were an alternative to the superhero comic books of D.C. and Marvel, yet in many ways &quot;American Splendor&quot; follows the standard superhero model.  Eventually Howard the Duck made his way to Cleveland, but clearly the city dismissed as the armpit of the nation already had its own superhero in Pekar.  The point that his life was less than ordinary is driven home repeatedly and ultimately the great appeal of this film is that it tells about an ordinary life in such a unique way.",5,In the words of Harvey Pekar ordinary life is pretty complex,1079222400,"03 14, 2004",2004,3156,"['have', 'tendency', 'embrace', 'films', 'celebrate', 'post-modernism', 'creative', 'way', 'exactly', 'what', 'quot', 'American', 'Splendor', 'quot', 'telling', 'story', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'legendary', 'writer', 'underground', 'comic', 'same', 'name', 'Once', 'time', '1970s', 'fact', 'Pekar', 'met', 'equally', 'legendary', 'comic', 'book', 'artist', 'R.', 'Crumb', 'complained', 'comic', 'books', 'were', 'never', 'ordinary', 'schleps', 'idea', 'appealed', 'Crumb', 'thus', 'wa', 'born', 'quot', 'American', 'Splendor', 'quot', 'written', 'Pekar', 'illustrated', 'Crumb', 'others', '2003', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Shari', 'Springer', 'Berman', 'Robert', 'Pulcini', 'are', 'treated', 'not', 'only', 'cinematic', 'depiction', 'Pekar', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'man', 'comic', 'book', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'sometimes', 'same', 'time', 'sense', 'film', 'Pekar', 'life', 'comic', 'book', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'life', 'moving', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'go', 'What', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'film', 'art', 'life', 'imitating', 'art', 'visa', 'versa', '.Pekar', 'life', 'curious', 'combination', 'pessimism', 'honesty', 'are', 'not', 'surprised', 'when', 'never', 'promoted', 'work', 'when', 'testicular', 'cancer', 'be', 'lot', 'life', 'given', 'Pekar', 'However', 'are', 'surprised', 'when', 'fan', 'who', 'comic', 'book', 'store', 'Joyce', 'Brabner', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'contact', 'hoping', 'extra', 'copy', 'issue', 'quot', 'American', 'Splendor', 'quot', 'missed', 'visit', 'curious', 'see', 'version', 'Pekar', 'comic', 'book', 'most', 'real', 'one', 'immediate', 'reaction', 'tell', 'quot', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'right', 'bat', 'had', 'vasectomy.', 'quot', 'response', 'later', 'date', 'severe', 'attack', 'food', 'poisioning', 'announce', 'quot', 'think', 'should', 'skip', 'whole', 'courtship', 'thing', 'just', 'get', 'married.', 'quot', 'kind', 'love', 'story.If', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'Harvey', 'Joyce', 'are', 'made', 'other', 'ability', 'coexist', 'confirmed', 'when', 'real', 'Harvey', 'Joyce', 'comment', 'proceedings', 'film', 'Giamatti', 'Davis', 'achieve', 'level', 'performance', 'where', 'are', 'simply', 'inhabiting', 'characters', 'best', 'way', 'making', 'real', 'important', 'more', 'sense', 'plot', 'quot', 'American', 'Splendor', 'quot', 'movie', 'there', 'was', 'quot', 'American', 'Splendor', 'quot', 'comic', 'book', 'Pekar', 'life', 'series', 'clashes', 'sometimes', 'David', 'Letterman', 'late', 'night', 'television', 'sometimes', 'other', 'people', 'hospital', 'where', 'file', 'clerk', 'sometimes', 'himself.The', 'great', 'irony', 'underground', 'comic', 'books', 'were', 'alternative', 'superhero', 'comic', 'books', 'D.C.', 'Marvel', 'yet', 'many', 'ways', 'quot', 'American', 'Splendor', 'quot', 'standard', 'superhero', 'model', 'Eventually', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'made', 'way', 'Cleveland', 'clearly', 'city', 'dismissed', 'armpit', 'nation', 'already', 'had', 'own', 'superhero', 'Pekar', 'point', 'life', 'was', 'less', 'ordinary', 'driven', 'home', 'repeatedly', 'ultimately', 'great', 'appeal', 'film', 'ordinary', 'life', 'such', 'unique', 'way']",American Splendor

I'll admit was not impressed with him prior to this film, but the reason I got this movie, mostly, was because I heard he gave such a great performance, and yes, yes he does!This movie is about the life of Harvey Pekar, as based on his comic series ""American Splendor"" which was based from his life. It includes interviews with the real Harvey Pekar and other people that are portrayed in the film as well, like his wife and co-workers. I find it interesting how such an ordinary guy cannot only have not only a successful comic book series, but this movie as well. Which is pretty impressive for such an unassuming guy, it just goes to show, anybody can have success if you work your tush off and face adversity head on, which the Pekar's certainly did. :D.It was fun to watch Paul Giamatti, I mean he really had Harvey down to-a-T. He not only gets his mannerism and voice, but his emotions as well. He portrays him as a person and not just a character. :D For once, I didn't hate Hope Davis, she normally annoys the heck out of me in movies likeThe Secret Lives Of DentistsAbout Schmidt, but her obnoxious qualities worked in favor for her in this film.Anyone who think their life sucks should watch this, or anyone who likes to watch good movies with good acting too. :D The acting really elevates this film.

783960,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B0000U0X20,"Maine Writer ""David""","[0, 2]","American Splendor is a movie with so many layers, reality starts to smudge and swirl, and bearings get lost.  It is startlingly well told, masterfully directed, and engaging on a number of levels.  But there is also an incipient sadness (and madness) to it, as we watch colorful, creative, and lost human beings--lost just like the rest of us--in an insane, confusing world.The movie is the story of Harvey Pekar, a man who doesn't quite fit into the flow of life.  Not that he really wants to or cares to, mind you.  After all, this is a guy who quits college after two semesters because the pressure of a math requirement was becoming too stressful.  Would that we could all be so self-directed and wise.  He wins and loses life's small and large battles on his own terms, making dear friends who seem enchanted with his otherworldly crankiness and stumbling through relationships with women who seem to be a combination of sublime understanding and bitchiness.  After all, how could any self-respecting modern woman want to live with a guy who is content to be a file clerk in a VA hospital, and whose apartment looks like Rodney Dangerfield's basement?  (Okay, I'm just assuming that Rodney Dangerfield has a crap filled basement.  Indulge me.)Harvey's other passions, driven by his love of art, music, and creativity, are record-collecting and writing autobiographical comics (with the help of a legion of clever artists, including his friend Crumb).  It is engaging to watch this clever, smart everyman, with more problems than anyone deserves to have, find a way to speak to the world, to reveal his soul.  And it is also a wonder to see his friends and associates gather round both to celebrate him and also take care of him when things get grim.A special word needs to go to the directors.  American Splendor is a masterful blending of live action, comic books, animation, snippets of real life (with the real Harvey and friends), and a lovely eye for humanity and what really matters in life.  I went out and bought this DVD.  Will I ever watch it again?  Maybe.  But, really, I don't have to.  The movie will resonate inside me for a long time.  What I'm glad about is that DVDs ought to hold together long enough that my grandkids will see it.

783961,A36EW68H08UOCS,B0000U0X20,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[0, 0]","Harvey Pekar is an interesting ""Everyman"" who allows us a look at the reality of his life.  The film opens as Harvey's 2nd marriage is breaking up after Harvey supported this 2nd wife through graduate school working as a file clerk at the VA Hospital in Cleveland.  A serendipitous meeting with cartoonist R. Crumb eventually leads Harvey to begin documenting his life as a cartoon, with Crumb doing the illustrations.  The resulting series, ""American Splendor"", becomes an underground hit - well acclaimed and not nearly good enough financially for Harvey to quit his file clerk job.Along the way Harvey meets Joyce - a hypochondriac who wants to do something with her life and identifies something in Harvey that makes her suggest on their first date that they should get married.The real people from Harvey's life make it into the comic strip, and the buzz eventually makes Harvey into a regular guest on Letterman.  Harvey recognizes that Letterman has him on the show over and over so that Harvey's regular life and his regular friends can be ridiculed by an audience that only has respect for entertainers who are ""larger than life"" - but Letterman also gives exposure to ""American Splendor"" with essentially free advertising.The resulting movie, by Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman, brilliantly blends live action - starring Paul Giamatti as Harvey and Hope Davis as Joyce - with animation based on the American Splendor drawings, and with interviews with the REAL Harvey - and the effect made me feel closer to the mind and creative process of Harvey Pekar.Harvey gets cancer and we get to see him go through several stages of coping, aided by Joyce.  In their first collaboration Joyce and Harvey produce ""Our Cancer Year"", another graphic novel.  Along the way they assume parenting duties of Danielle - the daughter of the illustrator of ""Our Cancer Year"" because Danielle's father sees more stability in the lives of Harvey and Joyce than in his own.Danielle confides in Harvey that she wants to start writing a comic book also.""Oh yeah?"" Harvey asks. ""What about?""""Well... not about you - you're already in enough.""Indeed - Harvey Pekar's life is as documented as any VA file clerk in American history.

Amazing, how a man can simultaneously embody the American Dream of fame and herodom, and the quiet desperation of everyday life.&quot;American Splendor&quot; tells the tale of such a man perhaps in the only way to do him justice - by any means necessary. It's mostly told with actors, but sometimes we get to meet the real Harvey and his friends and family. Sometimes we see some crude but effective animation. Sometimes everything is mixed together. The amazing thing is that the approach never seems gimmicky or self-conscious - it seems honest. There's never a moment during Paul Giamatti's astounding portrayal of Harvey that we doubt his authenticity, and we aren't disoriented in the least when the real Harvey shows up.The Harvey Pekar story, as told in &quot;American Splendor,&quot; is deeply moving. Here's a guy with a soul but a bleak outlook, one who is cursed to see the futility and inanity of his own existence. What separates him from so many of his bretheren, though, and quite possibly saves his life, is that he finds an outlet when he chooses to document his life in comic-book form. One one hand, this decision leads to his status as an underground hero, Letterman regular, and movie subject. On another, his life doesn't get any better, even though he manages, amazingly, to find a wife who pretty much understands him, and a child who seems to be his match.Harvey is difficult but impossible to dislike. You stick with him, even when he's being insufferable. That's true of the other characters in his life, played to perfection by Hope Davis as his wife, and Judah Friedlander as his ubernerd friend Toby. These are people who matter, and they deserve their voices, and ""American Splendor"" lets them speak, with enormously entertaining results.I love movies like &quot;American Splendor.&quot; Harvey is right - everyday life is pretty complex stuff.

783965,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0000U0X20,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","Perhaps it isn't surprising that &quot;American Splendor&quot; is the most creative and quirky film of 2003, considering it is based on an underground comic book that has entertained readers with its cynical but oddly amusing depiction of the life of Harvey Pekar, file clerk and all around working class stiff, since 1976. Frustrated by the obscurity and general lack of impact that his humdrum life provided him, Harvey decided that documenting it might be the way to overcome life's fleeting nature. But Harvey couldn't draw a straight line. So &quot;American Splendor&quot; was illustrated at first by Harvey's friend, underground comic icon Robert Crumb, and later by a succession of other artists. So for the past 28 years as of this writing, Harvey Pekar has documented his daily life in comics. He portrays his own anxieties and frustrations, his marriage, his friends, his co-workers, and his rise to fame frankly and without artifice. &quot;American Splendor&quot; is &quot;reality comics&quot;.Writer/directors Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman have transformed &quot;American Splendor&quot; and &quot;Our Cancer Year&quot;, a comic series that Pekar wrote with this wife Joyce Brabner, into a coherent offbeat film. Paul Giamatti portrays Harvey Pekar, and Hope Davis is his wife Joyce. Earl Billings gives a terrific supporting performance as Harvey's boss, Mr. Boats, as does Judah Friedlander as his co-worker Toby Radloff. The story is told through conventional cinematography, comic strips, and interviews with Harvey, Joyce, and Toby, filmed like a documentary against a comic-like set. In keeping with the sprit of his comics, we see the movie Harvey, and we meet the real Harvey. The directors' ability to adapt such lengthy and eccentric material and to bring  so many different styles together without it seeming at all disjointed is a real credit to their talent. If it seems hard to fathom why people would read a comic book about life's more mundane qualities for decades, the film  &quot;American Splendor&quot; leaves little doubt about the entertainment value of that material on screen.The DVD: Bonus features include a featurette entitled &quot;Road to Splendor&quot;, which follows Harvey and his family as they accompany this film from the Sundance Film Festival, to the Cannes Film Festival, to Comic-Con, and then on to &quot;American Splendor&quot;'s world premiere; the film's title song &quot;American Splendor&quot; by Eytan Mirsky; a DVD-ROM (Windows only) that contains downloadable wallpapers and screensavers; a theatrical trailer; and an audio commentary by Harvey Pekar, Joyce Brabner, Toby Radloff, Danielle Patone (Harvey &amp; Joyce's adopted daughter), Paul Giamatti, and writer/directors Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman. The audio commentary combines the personal experiences of the real characters in Harvey's world with technical information from the filmmakers. It's pretty interesting, but sometimes it is difficult to keep track of who is talking, as is so often the case when an audio commentary is done by a group.

It has been six months since my last review.  But to cut to the chase and for those who won't read any further.  Shari Springer Bergman's ""American Splendor,"" is a movie well worth watching.  I wouldn't call it a must see but I would say that it's definitely a worthwhile view and you won't wish you had that 101 minutes back in your life when all is said and done.Paul Giamatti plays a splendid Harvey Pekar.  Harvey Pekar, you very well may ask (that is if you can make a name a question)?  If you weren't a big Richard Crumb fan, or a comic book head, you might not recognize the name of Harvey Pekar but after the film is done you won't wonder who he is anymore.  The movie has some interesting conventions.  Clips of the real world folks from Pekar's life, as well as his personal commentary are interspersed with actors playing out the story.  At one point we even get a play within a film within a documentary if you can imagine such a thing.  It's great because it gives us a flash of Molly Shannon as Joyce Brabner who evidently didn't win out as the primary actress to play Brabner...Hope Davis.  But back to Giamatti.  He displays serious acting chops in one scene as he flashes a rare rare look of hope and engagement and then in an instant goes back to Pekar's usual demeanor of pessimism, curmudgeon-ary, and gloom.  It's like a timed black veil dropping on Pekar's face which tells you voluminous amounts in a moment about Pekar's psyche.  Brilliantly done Giamatti.The rest of the film stands up well and leaves you with a sense of a life depressed but one that overcomes it all to be lived fully.  Ultimately it is a tale of hope and Americana.  The scene where Giamatti/Pekar sits with his friend and acclaimed nerd Toby Radloff and discusses going to Toledo to see the monumental film offering of ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" will leave you with a resounding laugh and a laugh again (I told you it'd be resounding).Movie-lovers of the world untie...unite.

I suspect its appeal is generational; for people who are not familiar with Robert Crumb's work, some of the film will not register.This is, loosely speaking, a close relative of &quot;Crumb&quot;, the fascinating documentary of underground comic artist Robert Crumb and his tragically whacked out family.  Robert Crumb, after reaching his apothesis in the underground comic movement of the early 1970s, wandered the bus stations and park benches to find his &quot;everyman&quot;, the working stiff who understood Camus, obscure jazz records and could express firsthand the human condition of the the fileclearks and short-order graveyard cooks of Amerika.In &quot;American Spendor,&quot; we see how Crumb discovers Harvey Pekar, a self-recognized odd bodkin who bears the curse of recognizing his own condition as well as others around him.  He can't draw, but when he meets up with Crumb, it is a marriage made in heaven.  Pekar provides the stream of social commentary to merge with Crumb's dark realist and mysanthropic graphic style.(The actor playing Crumb has his mannerisms, down to the facial scratches, down perfectly).Giamatti is a perfect Pekar, as the movie demonstrates with aplomb by interchanging scenes of Giammati and the real Pekar.  Pekar is the file-room philosphe, a walking Beckett play, observing but incapable of bettering his lot.  (Eventually, he skyrockets to kitsch fame as a repeat Letterman curiousity - his paranoic implosion in the final appearance is gently dealt with here).Many objected to the scene where Giamatti (briefly playing himself ) observes an interaction between the real Pekar and the &quot;Nerd&quot;, and can't help but laugh out loud.  But Pekar takes it (as Robert Crumb does in his documentary), understanding he is different, and  trudges through, glowering at someone's cosmic Bad Joke.For anyone who has picked up a graphic novel or used to hide Crumb's comics under their mattress, I can't recommend this movie highly enough.Recommendations of related films:  &quot;Crumb&quot; (a must see), &quot;Ghost World&quot;",5,Superb indie film of underground comic hero,1086393600,"06 5, 2004",2004,2132,"['amazing', 'movie', 'justly', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2003', 'suspect', 'appeal', 'generational', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'work', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'register.This', 'loosely', 'speaking', 'close', 'relative', 'quot', 'Crumb', 'quot', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'underground', 'comic', 'artist', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'tragically', 'whacked', 'out', 'family', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'reaching', 'apothesis', 'underground', 'comic', 'movement', 'early', '1970s', 'wandered', 'bus', 'stations', 'park', 'benches', 'find', 'quot', 'quot', 'working', 'stiff', 'who', 'understood', 'Camus', 'obscure', 'jazz', 'records', 'could', 'express', 'firsthand', 'human', 'condition', 'fileclearks', 'short-order', 'graveyard', 'cooks', 'Amerika.In', 'quot', 'American', 'Spendor', 'quot', 'see', 'how', 'Crumb', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'self-recognized', 'odd', 'bodkin', 'who', 'curse', 'recognizing', 'own', 'condition', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'draw', 'when', 'up', 'Crumb', 'marriage', 'made', 'heaven', 'Pekar', 'stream', 'social', 'commentary', 'merge', 'Crumb', 'dark', 'realist', 'mysanthropic', 'graphic', 'style', 'actor', 'playing', 'Crumb', 'mannerisms', 'down', 'facial', 'scratches', 'down', 'perfectly', '.Giamatti', 'perfect', 'Pekar', 'movie', 'aplomb', 'interchanging', 'scenes', 'Giammati', 'real', 'Pekar', 'Pekar', 'file-room', 'philosphe', 'walking', 'Beckett', 'play', 'observing', 'incapable', 'bettering', 'lot', 'Eventually', 'kitsch', 'fame', 'repeat', 'Letterman', 'curiousity', 'paranoic', 'implosion', 'final', 'appearance', 'gently', 'dealt', 'here', '.Many', 'objected', 'scene', 'where', 'Giamatti', 'briefly', 'playing', 'interaction', 'real', 'Pekar', 'quot', 'Nerd', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'out', 'loud', 'Pekar', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'documentary', 'understanding', 'different', 'trudges', 'glowering', 'someone', 'cosmic', 'Bad', 'Joke.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'graphic', 'novel', 'used', 'hide', 'Crumb', 'comics', 'mattress', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'enough.Recommendations', 'related', 'films', 'quot', 'Crumb', 'quot', 'must', 'see', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'quot']",American Splendor

There are times throughout the movie where we're treated to the real Harvey, his wife, and friends in an interview format.

Why don't they ever talk about the mundane things? The stuff that most people hide from even their closest of friends and family, huh? That's what I want to hear! What were the supermarkets like where you grew up? How do you cope with cancer treatment? What's it like to work as a VA hospital file clerk?From off the streets of Cleveland comes American Splendor! A comic book series created by Harvey Pekar from Cleveland, OH. In 2003, a movie was made depicting the life and times of Harvey as played by Paul Giamatti. From his inspirational first meeting with underground comic book writer Robert Crumb (James Urbaniak), to meeting the love of his lifer, Joyce Brabner (Hope Davis) from Wilmington, Delaware, to when he discovered he had cancer and survived it by writing it into a comic book.The DVD presents this Independent film in it's original matted widescreen ratio of 1:85:1. The sound is offered in both 2.0 and 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound. The picture quality is marvelous and the way certain scenes were filmed, it gives the audience the illusion at times that they're actually reading a live comic book.The bonus features include Audio Commentary from directors and writers Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman, Harvey's movie counterpart Paul Giamatti, Harvey's best friend Toby Radloff, Toby's movie counterpart Judah Friedlander, Joyce Brabner, and Harvey and Joyce's daughter Danielle Batone. Although Harvey tends to keep quiet most of the time, the others have a wonderful time reminiscing on what scenes from the film were originally taken from their comic book form and what scenes were written specifically for the film itself.Other features include the original theatrical trailer, a featurette created by The Sundance Channel titled ""The Road to American Splendor"", a selection of upcoming DVDs from HBO Films, DVD-ROM downloads from the website [...] 3 Easter eggs, a full length audio clip of the song ""American Splendor"" performed by Eytan Mirsky, and as a special bonus a free comic enclosed with the DVD case titled ""My Movie Year"" which ran in Entertainment Weekly magazine from 2002-2003.American Splendor started out as a comic book series in the late 1970s dealing with the mundane aspects of life such as ""standing behind old Jewish ladies in supermarket lines,"" ""an argument at work,"" and ""pickled okra."" Harvey Pekar wrote all of these stories but the artwork would often be done by a series of artists including Robert Crumb, Gary Dumm, and Drew Friedman. Since then, American Splendor has been performed in a stage play format, and now as a feature film that depicts not just the actors, but the actual people they are playing! Harvey, Joyce, Toby, and Danielle all appear in the film of American Splendor as do the comic representations of Harvey.At times, the movie breaks away from its script and shows actual behind the scenes footage of the real Harvey, Toby, and Joyce doing interviews with the directors in a studio with a pure white background. One may consider this a newer version of the 1995 biopic Crumb directed by Terry Swigoff which the real Harvey makes reference to during one of these ""interviews.""The film American Splendor has won many awards including the 2003 Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, the 2003 Fipresci Award (International Film Critics Award) at the Cannes Film Festival, and has recently been nominated for the 2004 Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.Speaking for myself, I first noticed American Splendor in the summer of 2003 when after looking at a website for movie trailers, saw a title for a trailer called ""American Splendor."" Curiosity bit me and I checked the trailer out. I thought it was amazing. I wanted to see it very badly but it wasn't playing anywhere near me. In October, I did the next best thing and purchased the book American Splendor: The Life & Times Of Harvey Pekar at college which presented a huge selection of some of the best of the American Splendor comics. Eager for more, I purchased the soundtrack for the film and found myself immersed in a variety of Harvey Pekar's own hand picked jazz instrumentals and classic R & B hits including Marvin Gaye's Ain't That Peculiar and Jay McShann's Blue Devil Jump. With only a month or two before the film wound its way to DVD shelves, I purchased American Splendor: The Official Shooting Script and read through it picking out little niches and such that I easily related to.Now, I own the DVD of American Splendor which made its debut February 3, 2004. It is a truly remarkable film that I am happy to have as my own to cherish forever. I still find it amazing that even though Harvey Pekar's comic had been around since 1978, I only stepped into his world in June of 2003, and have enjoyed every minute of it. Harvey Pekar, you truly are a wonderful writer and as far as life goes, I truly believe in what you say, ""Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff.""",5,A True Contemporary Film,1093132800,"08 22,

Filmmakers have long made storyboards, which are nothing more than  scene-by-scene drawings.  In fact, they look a lot like comic books.  Martin Scorcese's film documentary talks of his storyboards from his youth.  Chasing Amy, Kevin Smith's best work, is about cartoonists.  True Romance, screenplay by Tarentino, the hero works in a comic book store.  Anyhow, not only can comic characters become the subject of film, but the creators and inkers become a movie as well.  Hence, we have  Crumb or even more unlikely, Harvey Pekar and his America Splendor, a comic book of his lifetime angst shot right to your Triplex.In truth, Harvey is the perfect underground artist.  He hates Capitalism, his wife hates Capitalism, and they (...)about having no money, yuppies, and their crappy apartment.  Okay, so Harvey has a learning disability that keeps him from the goodies that other Americans seem to pluck from trees.  Our schlep, Harvey, wanders aimlessly from his clerical job to his lonely crib in downtrodden Cleveland.But Capitalism finds Harvey despite himself.  His friend the famous Robert Crumb pens Harvey's new comic, American Slender and the next thing you know, he has a wife and a regular gig on the David Letterman show.  Then he gets cancer.This one reminded me of a far superior film about, no way, geeks that can't deal with modern society but are artistically brilliant, Ghost World.

783975,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B0000U0X20,Robert J. Crawford,"[2, 3]","I was given a copy of Pekar's first anthology in 1985, and I read it so many times I practically memorized it.  The great thing was that it had down to earth stories about normal people in a nowhere city, but they came through with a pathos and sense of striving that were throbbing with life.  Not much happens, but they leave an imprint, if you like good dense fiction.  Pekar is his milieu, however egomanaical, maladjusted, and sad he seems.  The stories range from reasoning about his non-existent career while buying bread to hanging out with a horrible, clueless woman for sex because he is so lonely.  All in a declining rustbelt  city.I wasn't sure what to expect with this film, but I bought it anyway.  From the start, I thought it was completely successful and a work of art that stood on its own.  You have the real Harvey Pekar as narrator, who occasionally appears to comment from a kind of inner sanctum mixing comics and the film set, and you have a wonderful actor, Paul Giamatti.  Then, you also have them watching themselves in a play and then on David Letterman.  It was a strange double or triple reflection of reality.The story is very well put together.  It starts when Pekar is getting divorced (2nd time), shows his life as a working-class intellectual, and then how he falls in love with someone as strange yet endearing as himself, Joyce.  Then, he survives cancer and even accepts a child into his life, which with his loudly announced vasectomy (on his first date with his wife) he was adamant never to do.  All through it, Pekar strives to develop his art, comic book writing that others illustrate.  He does his thing through sheer gall - and hey, if he doesn't, who would?  Every freelancer will identify with this.Giamatti really gets Pekar:  the constantly worried brow, the shuffling slump with his constant companion (a mild depression), yet also the good mind that is entirely self-taught.  It is brilliant.  But the feel of the film also reflects what I have witnessed:  there is even a scene where one character is introduced, Toby (whom I did not recall from the comic), and for a second I was convinced he was someone I really knew.  (You read this, Chris?)  I had to watch that scene several times, and even got my kids to watch the ""nerd"" as he defined himself - we all laughed, but felt sympathy as well.  That is typical Pekar.Someday, I believe, Pekar's work will be regarded as genuine literature that portrays the age, much I would wager, as do Chaucer or Froissart.  People will do Phds on it, but I prefer to simply enjoy it for what it is.

783977,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B0000U0X20,Robert Morris,"[7, 8]","What to make of this film? I asked myself that question after I emerged from the theater. Although in certain respects it reminded me of other documentaries (e.g. those produced by Frederick Wiseman and Michael Moore), it is quite unique and therefore, for me, difficult to discuss. Co-directed and co-written by Shari Springer-Berman and Robert Pulcini, American Splendor has a somewhat schizophrenic nature in that real people (Joyce and Harvey Pekar) interact with those cast to portray them (Hope Davis and Paul Giamatti) as Springer-Berman and Pulcini examine the life of a file clerk employed by a veterans hospital in Cleveland. Certain aspects of his life were previously portrayed in comic books which comprise the American Splendor series (illustrated by various people, including Robert Crumb played by James Urbaniak) and in Our Cancer Year (1994), co-authored by the Pekars.All this probably sounds much more complicated than it seems to be when seeing  the film itself. The narrative wanders along from one episode to the next. Along the way, Joyce and Harvey meet and marry, bicker, pout, struggle with finances, work together, bicker some more, etc. After Harvey appears on David Letterman's television program, he gains some degree of celebrity. Intriguing to me is his steadfast refusal to compromise any of his cranky opinions, notably about the very media which attract public attention to him. Also impressive is the skill with which Springer-Berman and Pulcini coordinate the aforementioned interaction between real people and members of the film's cast. Throughout the course of the film, I sensed a tension between the two groups...most evident in Harvey's body language which suggests both distance and hostility. With regard to the quality of acting, it is consistently outstanding.Earlier, I acknowledged the difficulty of discussing this film and my remarks thus far no doubt confirm that. So, rather than wander much further in this review, I will conclude with this observation: Imagine a film inspired by such diverse sources as John Bunyan, Franz Kafka, W.C Fields, Larry David, and the Simpsons.",5,Splendid Poignancy,1075507200,"01 31, 2004",2004,2128,"['What', 'make', 'film', 'asked', 'question', 'emerged', 'theater', 'certain', 'respects', 'reminded', 'other', 'documentaries', 'e.g', 'produced', 'Frederick', 'Wiseman', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'quite', 'unique', 'therefore', 'difficult', 'discuss', 'Co-directed', 'co-written', 'Shari', 'Springer-Berman', 'Robert', 'Pulcini', 'American', 'Splendor', 'somewhat', 'schizophrenic', 'nature', 'real', 'people', 'Joyce', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'interact', 'cast', 'portray', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Springer-Berman', 'Pulcini', 'examine', 'life', 'file', 'clerk', 'employed', 'veterans', 'hospital', 'Cleveland', 'Certain', 'aspects', 'life', 'were', 'previously', 'portrayed', 'comic', 'books', 'comprise', 'American', 'Splendor', 'series', 'illustrated', 'various', 'people', 'including', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'played', 'James', 'Urbaniak', 'Cancer', 'Year', '1994', 'co-authored', 'Pekars.All', 'probably', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'be', 'when', 'seeing', 'film', 'narrative', 'wanders', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'way', 'Joyce', 'Harvey', 'meet', 'marry', 'bicker', 'pout', 'struggle', 'finances', 'work', 'together', 'bicker', 'more', 'etc', 'Harvey', 'David', 'Letterman', 'television', 'program', 'gains', 'degree', 'celebrity', 'Intriguing', 'steadfast', 'refusal', 'compromise', 'cranky', 'opinions', 'notably', 'very', 'media', 'attract', 'public', 'attention', 'Also', 'impressive', 'skill', 'Springer-Berman', 'Pulcini', 'coordinate', 'aforementioned', 'interaction', 'real', 'people', 'members', 'film', 'cast', 'course', 'film', 'sensed', 'tension', 'two', 'groups', 'most', 'evident', 'Harvey', 'body', 'language', 'distance', 'hostility', 'regard', 'quality', 'acting', 'consistently', 'outstanding.Earlier', 'acknowledged', 'difficulty', 'discussing', 'film', 'remarks', 'thus', 'far', 'doubt', 'confirm', 'So', 'rather', 'wander', 'much', 'further', 'review', 'will', 'conclude', 'observation', 'Imagine', 'film', 'inspired', 'such', 'diverse', 'sources', 'John', 'Bunyan', 'Franz', 'Kafka', 'W.C', 'Fields', 'Larry', 'David', 'Simpsons']",American Splendor
783978,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000U0X20,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 3]","In ""American Splendor,"" Paul Giamatti plays Harvey Pekar, the comic book creator who became famous as a recurring guest on the David Letterman Show.  A resident of Cleveland, Pekar was a socially backward man who found he had the talent to translate the pain, loneliness and frustration of his own unhappy life into universal truths, writing material that other artists would then illustrate in comic book form.  He began a series entitled ""American Splendor,"" which was really an ongoing autobiographical narrative, drawing on people and events in his own life as his source of inspiration.  The film, a pseudo-documentary of sorts, tells his life story by cutting back and forth between both staged reenactments of the events in the stories and interviews with Pekar himself commenting on those events.""American Splendor"" is an offbeat little gem that, in many ways, approximates the look and style of a comic book.  As the story plays itself out, captions often appear on the screen, as well as illustrations from Pekar's actual work based on the scene we are witnessing.  Robert Pulcini and Sheri Springer Berman, who wrote and directed the film together, create a surrealistic tone by having Pekar and his real friends and companions frequently appear on screen next to the actors who are portraying them (some of them dead ringers for the originals).  This technique brings a homespun, homey sweetness to the film.  ""American Splendor"" is a paean to all the social misfits in the world, people who, for whatever reason, can't seem to fit into society's prescribed mold but who often develop strong, meaningful bonds with similar individuals.  The movie is also a tribute to the power of art, both for the artist who finds purpose and release through his work and for those to whom his work speaks on a personal and emotional level.  The people who inhabit Pekar's strange world - both in reality and within the borders of his comic strip boxes - are seen in the film as warm, good-natured individuals, not socially astute, perhaps, but not losers either.The emotional focal point for the film is Harvey's relationship with his wife, Joyce, beautifully played by Hope Davis.  Despite the somewhat bizarre nature of their marriage, Harvey and Joyce forge a lasting commitment based on reciprocity and devotion.  In fact, in the latter sections, the film achieves an emotional depth one doesn't expect it to early on, partly because Harvey is dealt a cruel blow of fate that he and his wife are forced to navigate through together.  Yet, the film as a whole is filled with a sly, deadpan, mischievous sense of humor that demonstrates a keen grasp of the absurdities of life.As Pekar, Paul Giametti turns in a flawless performance, capturing the nebbishness, cantankerousness and ultimate likeability of the man he is portraying.In both style and content, ""American Splendor"" is aptly named.",4,splendid biopic,1080345600,"03 27, 2004",2004,2893,"['American', 'Splendor', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'comic', 'book', 'creator', 'who', 'became', 'famous', 'recurring', 'guest', 'David', 'Letterman', 'Show', 'resident', 'Cleveland', 'Pekar', 'was', 'socially', 'backward', 'man', 'who', 'found', 'had', 'talent', 'translate', 'pain', 'loneliness', 'frustration', 'own', 'unhappy', 'life', 'universal', 'truths', 'writing', 'material', 'other', 'artists', 'would', 'then', 'illustrate', 'comic', 'book', 'form', 'began', 'series', 'entitled', 'American', 'Splendor', 'was', 'really', 'ongoing', 'autobiographical', 'narrative', 'drawing', 'people', 'events', 'own', 'life', 'source', 'inspiration', 'film', 'pseudo-documentary', 'sorts', 'life', 'story', 'cutting', 'back', 'forth', 'staged', 'reenactments', 'events', 'stories', 'interviews', 'Pekar', 'commenting', 'events', 'American', 'Splendor', 'offbeat', 'little', 'gem', 'many', 'ways', 'look', 'style', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'out', 'captions', 'often', 'appear', 'screen', 'as', 'well', 'illustrations', 'Pekar', 'actual', 'work', 'based', 'scene', 'are', 'witnessing', 'Robert', 'Pulcini', 'Sheri', 'Springer', 'Berman', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'together', 'create', 'surrealistic', 'tone', 'having', 'Pekar', 'real', 'friends', 'companions', 'frequently', 'appear', 'screen', 'next', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'portraying', 'dead', 'ringers', 'originals', 'technique', 'homespun', 'homey', 'sweetness', 'film', 'American', 'Splendor', 'paean', 'social', 'misfits', 'world', 'people', 'who', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'society', 'prescribed', 'mold', 'who', 'often', 'develop', 'strong', 'meaningful', 'bonds', 'similar', 'individuals', 'movie', 'also', 'tribute', 'power', 'art', 'artist', 'who', 'purpose', 'release', 'work', 'whom', 'work', 'speaks', 'personal', 'emotional', 'level', 'people', 'who', 'inhabit', 'Pekar', 'strange', 'world', 'reality', 'borders', 'comic', 'strip', 'boxes', 'are', 'seen', 'film', 'warm', 'good-natured', 'individuals', 'not', 'socially', 'astute', 'perhaps', 'not', 'losers', 'either.The', 'emotional', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'Harvey', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Joyce', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'somewhat', 'bizarre', 'nature', 'marriage', 'Harvey', 'Joyce', 'forge', 'lasting', 'commitment', 'based', 'reciprocity', 'devotion', 'fact', 'latter', 'sections', 'film', 'emotional', 'depth', 'one', ""n't"", 'expect', 'early', 'partly', 'Harvey', 'dealt', 'cruel', 'blow', 'fate', 'wife', 'are', 'forced', 'navigate', 'together', 'film', 'whole', 'filled', 'sly', 'deadpan', 'mischievous', 'sense', 'humor', 'keen', 'grasp', 'absurdities', 'life.As', 'Pekar', 'Paul', 'Giametti', 'flawless', 'performance', 'capturing', 'nebbishness', 'cantankerousness', 'ultimate', 'likeability', 'man', 'portraying.In', 'style', 'content', 'American', 'Splendor', 'aptly', 'named']",American Splendor

Not only does Harvey write the story's of American Splendor but is also the star, giving the birth to the first real person to be a comic book superhero.He has every superpower that you and I have.  Poor dishwashing skills, a job that sucks the life out of him, bad attitude....heck, he even gets cancer.This movie is based on Harvey's comic books.  Harvey is played by Paul Giamatti, who does a great job.  How he didn't get an Oscar Nod is beyond me.  The way the movie is made can also be called groundbreaking.  It mixes in Harvey, narrating and he also does interview breaks durning the movie, and Paul Giamatti who plays Harvey.  The movie also as some inventive ideas.  One has Giamatti standing in line at a grocery store, while a comic book version of him is yelling at him that is voiced by the real Hervy Pekar.  Very cool stuff.I thought it would be hard for me to get into someone who is always deppressed, angry, and simply just down...but it really hepled out to see Harvey in the movie.

Deming ""Backyard Trees""","[0, 0]","Harvey Pekar, born in 1939 in Cleveland, comically chronicles the minutiae of his everyday life as a file clerk in a VA Hospital, and the spectacular coincidence of meeting comic book genius Robert Crumb, who is instrumental in getting Pekar to write his own wildly successful graphic novels. Needing a woman, who else but Pekar, played to perfection by Tom Giammetti, could beg his second wife, ""Please don't leave"" in a voice that wheezes due to throat nodules, with the viewer laughing in empathic pathos. After she leaves, insulting him by calling his life ""plebian,"" he meets a bespectled woman, also played to perfection, and says in desperation, ""I think we should stop the whole courtship thing and get married."" They do.The new wife is a hilarious master at diagnosing people with psychiatric disorders - probably correctly - and when her Harvey is diagnosed with lymphoma, she fights to help him stay alive. The viewer vicariously undergoes chemo.Wildly innovative and entertaining, a great choice of music peppers the film, including the final solo of My Favorite Things by John Coltrane, paralleling the real Pekar's reviewing of jazz albums. Unforgettable scenes include the incorrigibly uncorruptible Pekar sparring on the David Letterman Show, angering and embarrassing the host, then of course chronicling it, as he does everything else, including Our Year of Cancer, writing himself back into the pink of health.Filmshots alternate between the real Harvey Pekar and his wife and their respective movie counterparts, a nice dichotomy.

Paul Giamatti and Hope Davis are a hoot as the underground artists Harvey Pekar and Joyce Brabner.  The mixture of documentary, animation and straightforward narrative are genuinely innovative and thought-provoking. This very much reminds me of Terry Zwigoff's ""Crumb"", a film which is mentioned in passing in this movie (and in this film the actor James Urbaniak gives an uncannily accurate performance as Crumb.)  The combination of ironic distance and compassion in recounting their subjects' lives are the same in both ""Crumb"" and ""American Splendor.""  The only flaw in ""American Splendor"" (if it even is a flaw) is that the film is more interesting than the comic series it is based on.  Pekar's work is drearily naturalistic little slices of life.  There's more humor and pathos in the film; the comic strikes me as, quite frankly, being the work of a really depressed guy.

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[1, 1]","AMERICAN SPLENDOR is based on the real life of Harvey Pekar (Paul Giamatti), a curmudgeonly, moody file clerk in a VA Hospital in Cleveland who writes comic books about his everyday experiences. Pekar serves as narrator and appears as himself occasionally as well, as interviews, file footage, and re-enacted scenes are blended to form a docudrama. Pekar sought fame and found it thanks to his comics (which are full of observations on life's mundane and mysterious moments, and feature artwork by such friends as Robert Crumb) and his appearances as a guest on David Letterman's talk show.My favorite scenes included Joyce (Hope Davis), his third wife, who cleverly matches Harvey's nuances and idiosyncrasies of her own. She is never enthusiastic about the success of the comic book, although she originally met Harvey by writing a fan letter to him. Joyce walks around with a permanent frown and suffers from her own psychological illnesses. Both Joyce and Harvey are good matches for each other and generally make each other miserable. Seeing these two miserable people together enhance this film's creativity.I have to admit that I've never heard of Harvey Pekar or the American Splendor comic books before this film was released; but I also don't read comic books, especially underground ones. Notwithstanding, I found the premise behind the comic strips to be original and interesting. Harvey appears to be a perfect candidate to write about the mundane happenings of his lived experiences since he has absolutely no prospects in his life.

It is directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, a duo who shows an astonishing confidence in not only their actors, but the screenplay they are working from also (beautifully written by Harvey Pekar and Joyce Brabner).The confidence is well placed, as the acting portraying the real life quirks of comic book artist Harvey Pekar, wife Joyce Brabner, and many supporting roles is pitch perfect. Don't know what these people are like in real life? Wondering what to compare them to? Not to worry, American Splendor features documentary segments of the real Harvey and friends, giving the film a second intriguing layer.Think about it - how much confidence does it take to show a segment where an actor (Paul Giamatti) portraying a real life man (Pekar) walks through a door, and on the other side of the door is a cut to real life video footage of that man? A whole lot of confidence. Giamatti seems to take the challenge in stride with his comedic ability, not to mention the wonderful Hope Davis as Brabner.

The director uses imaginative techniques to bring these three elements together, and it is done seamlessly.For the directors stlye, this film is a must-see, but as for the story itself, there is not much here. This is the story of a man whose life was turned into an underground comic book called &quot;American Splendor&quot;, but the problem is that there is not much to his life. The comic is based on his casual observations of life, but it is hard to swallow after a while, since Pekar is such a dissafected, cynical man, who cannot muster up the courage to look at the bright side of things every once in a while. Perhaps it is this very characteristic that people find so endearing about him, but I found it to be too cartoonish or deliberate for me to completely believe that this is how he really is.The acting in this film is top notch, and since every actor is playing a real person, it is easy to compare how they have done, since all the real people also appear in this film.There is nothing in &quot;American Splendor&quot; that will blow you away, because even the basis for Pekar's fame seems unclear. Having never read his comics, I do not know what these complex observations of seemingly simple things in life are, so therefore I do not fully comprehend his character, since the film assumes too many things about the viewer in the telling of this story, that such things are left out, perhaps on purpose.

Giamatti is excellent as Pekar. Hope Davis is a fine actress, but miscast here--no matter how shlumpy or depressive she tries to be, she can't stop being perky and appealing in a cute movie-star way... in a profound sense, she'll always be remote from the world of Pekar and Joyce Brabner.  The gap between the sort of lives that are usually represented in the media and the mundane experience of a file clerk in Cleveland is key to Pekar's work, and the film treats that gap as no big deal--you see, even the fileclerk gets to be a movie star, and his movie gets to have a tearjerking happy ending, too.",4,"Succumbs to some Hollywood phonyness, but still worth seeing",1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,1232,"['American', 'Splendor', 'enjoyable', 'intelligently', 'made', 'ultimately', 'not', 'so', 'far', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'balm', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'gritty', 'anti-romantic', 'ephinanies', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'best', 'work', 'filmmakers', 'deserve', 'credit', 'inviting', 'thought', 'artifice', 'film', 'examples', 'scenes', 'actors', 'interacting', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'people', 'portray', 'scenes', 'reveal', 'extent', 'film', 'Pekar', 'circle', 'make', 'more', 'quot', 'audience', 'friendly', 'quot', 'other', 'words', 'more', 'reassurring', 'fantasies', 'movie', 'audiences', 'are', 'accustomed', 'Giamatti', 'excellent', 'Pekar', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'fine', 'actress', 'miscast', 'here', 'matter', 'how', 'shlumpy', 'depressive', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'perky', 'appealing', 'cute', 'movie-star', 'way', 'profound', 'sense', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'remote', 'world', 'Pekar', 'Joyce', 'Brabner', 'gap', 'sort', 'lives', 'are', 'usually', 'represented', 'media', 'mundane', 'experience', 'file', 'clerk', 'Cleveland', 'key', 'Pekar', 'work', 'film', 'treats', 'gap', 'big', 'deal', 'see', 'even', 'fileclerk', 'be', 'movie', 'star', 'movie', 'have', 'tearjerking', 'happy', 'ending', 'too']",American Splendor

After watching this yesterday, I have no idea why any such praise was bestowed on this film, which is mediocre at best.The film is virtually plotless, jumping around to high and low points of Pekar's life, none of which I found particularly interesting or compelling.  The film, like Pekar's comics, focuses on the mundane, the everyday life of everyday people.  That's the underlying point of the film and I know that, but it didn't make either my wife or me enjoy the film.Equally irritating was the insertion of autobiographical commentary by the actual participants.  Again, I realize that this is an intentional device used by the filmmakers as part of the blurring of the line between the fictionalized reality Pekar wrote about and the reality he lived.  Unfortunately, none of it made me care a whit for these sad, hopeless characters living in squalorous circumstances largely of their own construction.The only compliment I can bestow upon the film is that it was generally well cast.  Paul Giamatti makes a good Pekar, Hope Davis is a dead ringer for a younger version of Pekar's wife, and the actor portraying Pekar's nerdy friend is almost indistinguishable from the real Toby Radloff.  In fact, this character, and to a certain extent, Hope Davis' ""planning to be ill"" hypochondriac are the only two characters that are of any interest in the film, and even their quirkiness quickly becomes tiresome.Some people will say that I missed the point of the film in this review.  I would respond that I saw the message that the filmmakers were trying to convey, but frankly, I just didn't care.  If I want mundane details of life, I will look at the lives of the people around me, not to a supposedly ""great"" film.

783991,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000U0X20,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 4]","If you have never heard of the comic book series 'American Spledor' or its creator Harvey Pekar, you don't have to worry.  All you have to know is that slightly ironically-titled 'American Splendor' offers very unique account of a life of a man in Cleveland who made it by just being himself, working as a file clerk in local hospital.  The only thing he did was to observe his ordinary life, and made it a comic book.  And a quite original one.These things are all brilliantly told in this film, which is a curious blend of fiction and non-fiction.  Paul Giamatti plays Harvey Pekar, jazz record collector who is not satisfied with his ordinary life.  One day Pekar meets a future underground comic genius Robert Crumb (who is perhaps known for the design for Janis Joplin album 'Cheap Thrills').  Crumb acknowledges an unique talent of Pekar who can bring life to the apparently humdrum things surrounding our ordinary life, and provides the drawings for him.The collaboration 'American Splendor' brings unexpected things to his life: one of them is Joyce Brabner, fan of his comics who comes to meet and marry him.  Joyce, 'vegitarian who is allegic to vegitables,' played by fantastic Hope Davis (with a pair of big-rimmed glasses) is another charm to this film, who holds her own despite the messy room of Pekar.The film's bonus point is that it portrays Pekar's life in an unusual way, narrated by Pekar himself, who often appears on the screen, even sharing it with Giamatti himself.  Joyce herself also appears, who, even during a short time, gives us a strong impression that she is quite a character.  And so is Pekar.But the greatest thing about 'American Splendor' is that it succeeds in showing the personalities of these people without much dramatizing them.  These people are not perfect, sure, and Paul Giamatti's Pekar always looks very angry.  But that is part of the charms of the film, which ultimately affirms the values of life.  And the characters depicted here are the genuine ones.Paul Giamatti is superb as Pekar, though he doesn't seem to have changed much.  More brilliant is Hope Davis, who undergoes a perfect transformation, and shows an uncanny resemblance to the real Joyce.  And she is curiously charming, which explains why they fell in love in the way the film shows (it starts with letter writing).You don't see all-American heroes, or hear any sentimental words here.  You just meet very interesting, and likable people about whom you want to know more.  And 'American Splendor' gives you a chance to meet them, and make you think about the thin line between ordinary and extraordinary.",5,Harvey Pekar: Exceptional Life of an Ordinary Guy,1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,2624,"['have', 'never', 'heard', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'Spledor', 'creator', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'have', 'know', 'slightly', 'ironically-titled', ""'American"", 'Splendor', 'offers', 'very', 'unique', 'account', 'life', 'man', 'Cleveland', 'who', 'made', 'just', 'being', 'working', 'file', 'clerk', 'local', 'hospital', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'was', 'observe', 'ordinary', 'life', 'made', 'comic', 'book', 'quite', 'original', 'one.These', 'things', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'told', 'film', 'curious', 'blend', 'fiction', 'non-fiction', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Harvey', 'Pekar', 'jazz', 'record', 'collector', 'who', 'not', 'satisfied', 'ordinary', 'life', 'One', 'day', 'Pekar', 'future', 'comic', 'genius', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'who', 'perhaps', 'known', 'design', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'album', ""'Cheap"", 'Thrills', 'Crumb', 'unique', 'talent', 'Pekar', 'who', 'can', 'bring', 'life', 'apparently', 'humdrum', 'things', 'surrounding', 'ordinary', 'life', 'drawings', 'him.The', 'collaboration', 'Splendor', 'brings', 'unexpected', 'things', 'life', 'one', 'Joyce', 'Brabner', 'fan', 'comics', 'who', 'meet', 'marry', 'Joyce', ""'vegitarian"", 'who', 'allegic', 'vegitables', 'played', 'fantastic', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'pair', 'big-rimmed', 'glasses', 'charm', 'film', 'who', 'own', 'messy', 'room', 'Pekar.The', 'film', 'bonus', 'point', 'Pekar', 'life', 'unusual', 'way', 'narrated', 'Pekar', 'who', 'often', 'screen', 'even', 'sharing', 'Giamatti', 'Joyce', 'also', 'who', 'even', 'short', 'time', 'strong', 'impression', 'quite', 'character', 'so', 'Pekar.But', 'greatest', 'thing', ""'American"", 'Splendor', 'showing', 'personalities', 'people', 'much', 'dramatizing', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'sure', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Pekar', 'always', 'very', 'angry', 'part', 'charms', 'film', 'ultimately', 'values', 'life', 'characters', 'depicted', 'here', 'are', 'genuine', 'ones.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'superb', 'Pekar', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'changed', 'much', 'More', 'brilliant', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'who', 'perfect', 'transformation', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'real', 'Joyce', 'curiously', 'charming', 'why', 'fell', 'love', 'way', 'film', 'shows', 'letter', 'writing', '.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'all-American', 'heroes', 'hear', 'sentimental', 'words', 'here', 'just', 'meet', 'very', 'interesting', 'likable', 'people', 'whom', 'want', 'know', 'more', ""'American"", 'Splendor', 'chance', 'meet', 'make', 'think', 'thin', 'line', 'ordinary', 'extraordinary']",American Splendor

Based upon the life and comics of Harvey Pekar, AMERICAN SPLENDOR attempts to tell part of Harvey's life and how he became a semi-famous underground comic book writer. At face value, the story doesn't seem like much. After all, there are millions of people who live lives very similar to Harvey's. However, that's part of the film's appeal: it resonates with the everyman in us all. Paul Giamatti pulls off a wonderful performance of Pekar, catching all of Pekar's nuances, seeming to be the exact version of the Pekar from twenty years ago.I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It dares to dive into the question of &#34;does art imitate life or does life imitate art?&#34;. Before seeing this movie, I would have said that art imitates life. However, this movie made me question that. Pekar's life was the inspiration for his art, but now his art has become his life. The film plays with this idea in several different ways from the comic-book animated parts of the film to Pekar actually appearing in the film several different times and ways to the actual Letterman appearances Pekar made in the 1980s. I still believe that art is an imitation of life, but the movie made me rethink that assumption. Also, I enjoyed this film because it illustrates how each one of us is an unique person and that beneath the rugged exteriors of us all there lies substance of worth.

Pekar's life is examined with the intriguing mixture of biographical elements, surrealism, mixed media (documentary, interview, dramatisation, and animation), and dry, unconventional humour (better utilised here than in a Wes Anderson film) that all accumulates an already satisfying package of the frustrated, lonely everyman into something more special.Paul Giamatti brings an excellent performance as Pekar making the most out of his knackery, frustration, illnesses, and peculiarity with other characters like Joyce played by Hope Davis full of neurosis and Toby played by Judah Friedlander who makes an almost Oscar-worthy supporting comic performance. Some of the scenes are at best repeatable through your DVD player with some including Toby wanting to see Revenge of the Nerds and Pekar walking through the street with the real Pekar doing the narration about this film being not a typical happy film. Robert Crumb's character is strikingly hilarious and intriguing too with him using the phrase, ""man"", quite a bit (even more funnier when I seen a BBC documentary about the twisted-perverted artist himself).I like how the film examines an ordinary lifestyle and makes use of seeing a lonely man achieve a certain level of fame and recognition and does not shy away into Hollywood cliches and conventions that the film otherwise mocks in it. Also, the 70s-inspired cinematography and low-key elements (especially the jazz music and acting) are what make for a purely independent film and how respected it is shows that the comic book series and the film adaptation give the two names, ""comic"" and ""book"" a less childish, underprivileged name. It is funny in so many parts yet it is tragic and yet it is quirky on so many levels that it cannot even be categorised as one only thing.Without giving too much away, I recommend that you place American Splendor on your list no matter how offbeat and sometimes dire it may be. While some of Pekar's actions are questionable, it does not take away from how credible the film is and its personal strengths.
