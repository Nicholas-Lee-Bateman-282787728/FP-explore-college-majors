Selleck creates a character that I'd love to know.  The acting is good, the stories are entertaining, and somewhat twisted.  My family loved each one of them.The plots are a well developed if not a bit predictable.  I found something unexpected in each one of them.I own these movies..",5,Really excellent,1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,391,"['best', 'cinema', 'dependent', 'creating', 'characters', 'care', 'series', 'spades', 'Selleck', 'character', ""'d"", 'love', 'know', 'acting', 'good', 'stories', 'are', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'twisted', 'family', 'loved', 'one', 'them.The', 'plots', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'not', 'bit', 'predictable', 'found', 'something', 'unexpected', 'one', 'them.I', 'movies..']",Jesse Stone 4-pack: (Stone Cold / Night Passage / Death in Paradise / Sea Change)

In fact I love these DVDs.As of the date of this review, you can buy each of the 4 DVDs in the set individually for $42.46.  Why would anyone pay $52.49 for a set of the same 4 DVDs.  There doesn't appear to be anything to justify the extra ten dollars.I find this a lot on combined items.  I think Amazon adjusts the prices of the individual items but never looks at the sets.Buyer Beware",1,Check the Pricing,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,467,"['rating', 'based', 'only', 'price', '4', 'disk', 'set', 'not', 'content', 'fact', 'love', 'DVDs.As', 'date', 'review', 'can', 'buy', '4', 'DVDs', 'set', 'individually', '42.46', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'pay', '52.49', 'set', 'same', '4', 'DVDs', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'anything', 'justify', 'extra', 'ten', 'dollars.I', 'find', 'lot', 'combined', 'items', 'think', 'Amazon', 'prices', 'individual', 'items', 'never', 'sets.Buyer', 'Beware']",Jesse Stone 4-pack: (Stone Cold / Night Passage / Death in Paradise / Sea Change)
1172104,A1F07EXBSN5R5N,B001BJH69C,Richard,"[0, 0]",The music is soulful and perfect as the backdrop to these films.  Tom Selleck is his best as a cop though his westerns are great too... Monty Walsh.  His character is low key but determined.  What do they say?  &#34;He always gets his man/woman&#34;.  His character is well developed and the mysteries believable.  There is room for many additional movies.  I like the small town setting.  There are four additional movies from this series.  Keep them coming Tom.,5,Great series,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,463,"['music', 'soulful', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'films', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'best', 'cop', 'westerns', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'Monty', 'Walsh', 'character', 'low', 'key', 'determined', 'What', 'do', 'say', '34', 'always', 'man/woman', '34', 'character', 'well', 'developed', 'mysteries', 'believable', 'room', 'many', 'additional', 'movies', 'small', 'town', 'setting', 'are', 'four', 'additional', 'movies', 'series', 'Keep', 'coming', 'Tom']",Jesse Stone 4-pack: (Stone Cold / Night Passage / Death in Paradise / Sea Change)

We all like Tom Selleck a lot, and love his movies, especially his westerns, but also his Jesse Stone movies. We find them very entertaining, and Tom`s acting is always superb!!
