The plot seemed great, but the story's twists and turns could have been thought of by a 3rd grade classroom...and they frankly make our heroine look as dumb as a brick.  How did this girl not figure out that the lawyer was giving up information to the adoptive family?  Hello...earth to Leelee.

These kids' parents both just died on the way home from celebrating their anniversary. Supposedly, the driver had too much booze in him and swerved off the road in the rain. So the kids go and live with Mr. and Mrs. Glass who live in a glass house. They were old friends of the parents and were to be the legal guardians of their kids if something like this were to happen. Their lawyer tells the kids that their parents were economical and they left them several million dollars. It turns out the Glasses were using them to try to steal their money.Mrs. Glass is a doctor but she turns out to be addicted to heroin. Mr. Glass is in business but their money for the Glass House and his Jaguar sports car turned out to come from a loan shark. It's mysterious at first, because the girl isn't sure whether or not the Glasses are sincere or what the hell is going on. Her brother is younger and is simply content and bought-off with everything the Glasses spoil him with. She does some research and finds out that her parents were set up and murdered; it was no accident. The girl is pretty [good looking], especially when she's in the swimming pool in the scene where Mr. Glass comes out with a towel in the middle of the night.The point of the movie is that money has good use, but you've gotta earn it and be productive-- stealing it doesn't work. And you've gotta live within your means and stay out of debt. Mr. Glass never seemed very happy even with all the ""toys"". It sure didn't seem like it was worth all the stress and trouble that he went through to try to steal their money.",3,Just an average movie.,1023321600,"06 6, 2002",2002,1728,"['so', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'one', 'money', 'obsession', 'people', 'have', 'how', 'obsession', 'harmful', 'others', 'kids', 'parents', 'just', 'died', 'way', 'home', 'celebrating', 'anniversary', 'Supposedly', 'driver', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'booze', 'swerved', 'off', 'road', 'rain', 'kids', 'go', 'live', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Glass', 'who', 'live', 'glass', 'house', 'were', 'old', 'friends', 'parents', 'were', 'be', 'legal', 'guardians', 'kids', 'something', 'were', 'happen', 'lawyer', 'kids', 'parents', 'were', 'economical', 'left', 'several', 'million', 'dollars', 'out', 'Glasses', 'were', 'using', 'try', 'steal', 'money.Mrs', 'Glass', 'doctor', 'out', 'be', 'addicted', 'heroin', 'Mr.', 'Glass', 'business', 'money', 'Glass', 'House', 'Jaguar', 'sports', 'car', 'turned', 'out', 'come', 'loan', 'shark', 'mysterious', 'first', 'girl', ""n't"", 'sure', 'not', 'Glasses', 'are', 'sincere', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'brother', 'younger', 'simply', 'content', 'bought-off', 'everything', 'Glasses', 'spoil', 'research', 'out', 'parents', 'were', 'set', 'up', 'murdered', 'was', 'accident', 'girl', 'pretty', '[', 'good', 'looking', ']', 'especially', 'when', 'swimming', 'pool', 'scene', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Glass', 'out', 'towel', 'middle', 'night.The', 'point', 'movie', 'money', 'good', 'use', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'earn', 'be', 'productive', 'stealing', ""n't"", 'work', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'live', 'means', 'stay', 'debt', 'Mr.', 'Glass', 'never', 'seemed', 'very', 'happy', 'even', 'toys', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'was', 'worth', 'stress', 'trouble', 'went', 'try', 'steal', 'money']",N/A

680423,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005RYKU,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Typical and predictable, this is one of those films that is surely entertaining and an unintentionally campy kind of way.  The film, while starting off rather strong, dissolves into ridiculousness, but for some strange reason it never really loses what it initially set out to attain; our attention.When their parents die in a freak car accident, Ruby and her younger brother find themselves in a gigantic (albeit creepy) house with their new guardians.  While they are on the outset charming and generous, Ruby's new family soon becomes anything but.  As the film progresses, Ruby begins to uncover dark secrets and suspicious about her parent's death and the true intentions of her new `daddy'.This film came out right about the time that Leelee Sobieski was becoming famous; you know, that two-year period when she was in movies.  I'm saddened that her career didn't go anywhere.  She had talent.  She had looks.  She had appeal.  I can't explain her disappearance, for it doesn't really make sense (but then again, there are a number of starlets who all but disappeared for no reason).  As a vehicle to show off her rise to fame, this one works well.  She definitely works the camera and knows how to address the melancholy side of the story without overdoing it.For me though, this film rests on Stellan Skarsgard's performance.Without a keen eye and an understanding delivery, this performance could have tanked this entire film.  Instead, Stellan breathes a life into his character that is every ounce of what it should be.  Yes, in the end he kind of veers off into absurdity along with the script (why did they do that) but he maintains a level of honest eeriness that keeps his character chilling, not comical.This is far from a great movie, but it is far from a waste of time.

I've argued for weeks with people about the flaws of the `Star Wars' prequels and `Firefly'. `The Glass House' put me into such a good mood all I can say is, ignore the flaws and enjoy the movie.The plot: As you may remember from the trailers, this whole movie can be summed up in 30 seconds. Sister Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobieski) and brother Rhett Baker (Trevor Morgan, lost kid in `Jurassic Park III') are orphaned by a car accident. They are sent to live with their late parents' friends, Terri and Aaron Glass who live in a big glass house. Get it? It's pretty obvious the Glasses are psycho and killed the parents to inherit their fortune, with the children in the way; it's time to kill them too. It's like one of those stalker movies we were over saturated with in the early 90s after the surprise success of `The Hand That Rocks The Cradle'.Roger Ebert described this as a movie where we already know the story; we're just waiting for the characters to catch up.Not only is the story predictable but the villains are not even scary, just pathetic. They don't commit crimes out of evil but to buy drugs and pay off loan sharks.With all that said, this is a great movie! Leelee Sobieski really looks hot in this. The filmmakers also give her some very sexy outfits for her to bounce around in. And can she bounce.Another notable performance is by uber villain Stellan Skarsgard who's always playing Eastern Europeans of different ethnicity. He was a great villain in `Ronin' as well.Director Daniel Sacheim, who mainly works on television, gives `The Glass House' and high production level, with photography and editing.Although it's only a small part of the film, this seems to be the major focus of the reviews here on Amazon-- how the Glasses force Ruby and Rhett to share the same room. Many are arguing that this serves no purpose in the plot of the film. What they fail to realize is that having teenage siblings share a room (or bed) is a classic movie technique, to experience something completely FUBAR. We can joke about it, but the truth is everyone here on Amazon seems to be morbidly curious about it. Yes, Ruby and Rhett do accuse each other of ""peeking"" while they undress at least 3 separate times. Hummmmm, what's in those deleted scenes? (sadly nothing)For more implied teenage sibling incest, I highly recommend, 'Flowers In the Attic.'",5,Shut Up and Enjoy The Movie,1124668800,"08 22, 2005",2005,2399,"[""'m"", 'notorious', 'analyzing', 'films', ""'ve"", 'argued', 'weeks', 'people', 'flaws', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'Firefly', 'Glass', 'House', 'put', 'good', 'mood', 'can', 'say', 'ignore', 'flaws', 'enjoy', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'may', 'remember', 'trailers', 'whole', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', '30', 'seconds', 'Sister', 'Ruby', 'Baker', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'Rhett', 'Baker', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'lost', 'kid', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'III', 'are', 'orphaned', 'car', 'accident', 'are', 'sent', 'live', 'late', 'parents', 'friends', 'Terri', 'Aaron', 'Glass', 'who', 'live', 'big', 'glass', 'house', 'Get', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Glasses', 'are', 'psycho', 'killed', 'parents', 'inherit', 'fortune', 'children', 'way', 'time', 'kill', 'too', 'one', 'stalker', 'movies', 'were', 'over', 'saturated', 'early', '90s', 'surprise', 'success', 'Hand', ""Cradle'.Roger"", 'Ebert', 'described', 'movie', 'where', 'already', 'know', 'story', ""'re"", 'just', 'waiting', 'characters', 'catch', 'up.Not', 'only', 'story', 'predictable', 'villains', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'scary', 'just', 'pathetic', 'do', ""n't"", 'commit', 'crimes', 'evil', 'buy', 'drugs', 'pay', 'off', 'loan', 'sharks.With', 'said', 'great', 'movie', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'really', 'hot', 'filmmakers', 'also', 'give', 'very', 'sexy', 'outfits', 'bounce', 'around', 'can', 'bounce.Another', 'notable', 'performance', 'uber', 'villain', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'who', 'always', 'playing', 'Eastern', 'Europeans', 'different', 'ethnicity', 'was', 'great', 'villain', 'Ronin', 'well.Director', 'Daniel', 'Sacheim', 'who', 'mainly', 'television', 'Glass', 'House', 'high', 'production', 'level', 'photography', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'film', 'be', 'major', 'focus', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'how', 'Glasses', 'force', 'Ruby', 'Rhett', 'share', 'same', 'room', 'Many', 'are', 'arguing', 'purpose', 'plot', 'film', 'What', 'fail', 'realize', 'having', 'teenage', 'siblings', 'share', 'room', 'bed', 'classic', 'movie', 'technique', 'experience', 'something', 'completely', 'FUBAR', 'can', 'joke', 'truth', 'everyone', 'here', 'Amazon', 'be', 'morbidly', 'curious', 'Yes', 'Ruby', 'Rhett', 'do', 'accuse', 'other', 'peeking', 'undress', 'least', '3', 'separate', 'times', 'Hummmmm', 'what', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'sadly', 'nothing', 'more', 'implied', 'teenage', 'sibling', 'incest', 'highly', 'recommend', ""'Flowers"", 'Attic']",N/A

Things aren't as they seem in the Glass's glass home, which is pretty cool.  The point of the film being that trust is transparent and so a glass house is used to represent that beings that everything is easily seen and heard, much like the underlying plot twists which are easily seen and heard before we, the veiwer, should know them.  That's the problem here is the predictability, but then again, even with predictability it still packs a punch.  This isn't the best thriller to come out by far, but Skarsgrd makes for a believable and quite scary villian.  So Ruby and Rhett realize, Ruby first, that the Glass's are using them for their inheritance which comes up to about $4 million dollars and this spirals into a game of cat and mouse that is a bit intense, thanks to Skarsgrd's verosity.

680436,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005RYKU,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 5]","After an impressive number of supporting movie roles, the lovely Leelee Sobieski takes center stage in this impressive psychological thriller, delivering a performance I found both wonderful and, most importantly, believable.  While the plot may not be all that original and unpredictable, I found The Glass House to be an absorbing, suspenseful movie that never relented in its building psychological intensity.  Anyone who sets out to hurt a character played by Leelee gets my full attention and disdain, but the evil husband and wife responsible for all the villainy espoused in this film do an excellent job of deserving all the disgust I felt for them.While Miss Sobieski looks a tad older than the sweet sixteen age of her character Ruby Baker, her natural sweetness and vulnerability make her quite convincing as a normal young teenager whose life is thrown into chaos when her parents are killed in an automobile accident.  Ruby and her eleven-year-old brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) go to live with Terry and Erin Glass (played quite impressively by Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane), their former neighbors and designated custodians.  Their new home is an impressive, unique structure with many glass walls and an ultra-modern interior design.  Rhett settles in quite well, but Ruby is uncomfortable from the start.  Early on, she realizes that the Glasses are not the perfect couple they purport to be.  At first, she attempts to rationalize her problems, ascribing her difficulty adjusting to her new life as a natural reaction to her grief over the loss of her parents and the social dislocation she feels upon moving to a new city and attending a new school.  Little things continue to happen, however, and she soon finds herself seeking help from her parents' estate lawyer.  When she learns that her parents' estate adds up to four million dollars, she finally begins to suspect her guardians of having somehow played a part in her parents' deaths and to fear that she and her brother are in grave danger as long as they remain in the house.I thought the ending played out very well.  There was one important plot point which I did not expect (along with a few that I did), and the suspense that had been building up consistently throughout the movie reached its peak at just the right time.  I don't find any real absurdity to the ending - slightly clich&eacute;d: yes, but absurd: no.  I think Sobieski is just wonderful and quite convincing in her role of what is a pretty typical teenaged girl forced to deal with a terrifying, almost hopeless situation.  The film succeeds as well as it does, in my opinion, because Lane and Skarsgard give strong performances of their own opposite Sobieski's.  The end result is a suspenseful triumph that I found refreshingly thrilling and convincing.",5,"An absorbing, intense psychological thriller",1061683200,"08 24, 2003",2003,2806,"['impressive', 'number', 'supporting', 'movie', 'roles', 'lovely', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'center', 'stage', 'impressive', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'delivering', 'performance', 'found', 'wonderful', 'most', 'importantly', 'believable', 'plot', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'original', 'unpredictable', 'found', 'Glass', 'House', 'be', 'absorbing', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'never', 'relented', 'building', 'psychological', 'intensity', 'Anyone', 'who', 'out', 'hurt', 'character', 'played', 'Leelee', 'full', 'attention', 'disdain', 'evil', 'husband', 'wife', 'responsible', 'villainy', 'espoused', 'film', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'deserving', 'disgust', 'felt', 'them.While', 'Miss', 'Sobieski', 'tad', 'older', 'sweet', 'sixteen', 'age', 'character', 'Ruby', 'Baker', 'natural', 'sweetness', 'vulnerability', 'make', 'quite', 'convincing', 'normal', 'young', 'teenager', 'life', 'thrown', 'chaos', 'when', 'parents', 'are', 'killed', 'automobile', 'accident', 'Ruby', 'eleven-year-old', 'brother', 'Rhett', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'go', 'live', 'Terry', 'Erin', 'Glass', 'played', 'quite', 'impressively', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'former', 'neighbors', 'designated', 'custodians', 'new', 'home', 'impressive', 'unique', 'structure', 'many', 'glass', 'walls', 'ultra-modern', 'interior', 'design', 'Rhett', 'quite', 'well', 'Ruby', 'uncomfortable', 'start', 'Early', 'Glasses', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'couple', 'purport', 'be', 'first', 'rationalize', 'problems', 'ascribing', 'difficulty', 'adjusting', 'new', 'life', 'natural', 'reaction', 'grief', 'loss', 'parents', 'social', 'dislocation', 'moving', 'new', 'city', 'attending', 'new', 'school', 'Little', 'things', 'continue', 'happen', 'however', 'soon', 'seeking', 'help', 'parents', 'estate', 'lawyer', 'When', 'parents', 'estate', 'up', 'four', 'million', 'dollars', 'finally', 'suspect', 'guardians', 'having', 'somehow', 'played', 'part', 'parents', 'deaths', 'fear', 'brother', 'are', 'grave', 'danger', 'as', 'long', 'remain', 'house.I', 'thought', 'ending', 'played', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'one', 'important', 'plot', 'point', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'few', 'did', 'suspense', 'had', 'been', 'building', 'up', 'consistently', 'movie', 'reached', 'peak', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'real', 'absurdity', 'ending', 'slightly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'yes', 'absurd', 'think', 'Sobieski', 'just', 'wonderful', 'quite', 'convincing', 'role', 'what', 'pretty', 'typical', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'forced', 'deal', 'terrifying', 'almost', 'hopeless', 'situation', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'opinion', 'Lane', 'Skarsgard', 'give', 'strong', 'performances', 'own', 'opposite', 'Sobieski', 'end', 'result', 'suspenseful', 'triumph', 'found', 'refreshingly', 'thrilling', 'convincing']",N/A
680437,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005RYKU,D. Litton,"[13, 18]","Trailers say too much about their movies these days, giving away too many secrets so that any impact the actual film will have is weakened. &quot;The Glass House&quot; is no exception, but while the trailer lets us in on the movie's secrets, the suspense behind them comes out unscathed. You may know what will happen, but getting there is quite a ride in this uniquely stylish teenage thriller.The film stars Leelee Sobieski as Ruby Baker, who lives like any typical teenager going to prep school in Los Angeles and sneaking out of her house at night. On the night of her parents' 20th wedding anniversary, she comes home to discover them killed in a car wreck, leaving her and her young brother Rhett in the care of their former next-door neighbors, Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane). Soon after the funeral, it's off the Malibu, and the beginning of a whole new life.The Glass house itself is made up of much glass, inside and out, providing a creepy atmosphere where things are constantly uneasy. From the get-go, Ruby gets the feeling that she is being watched, and the fact that her new guardians continuously shower them with gifts seems more like a purchase of their trust. As the months go by, things begin to lose their luster: Terry begins to make not-so-subtle passes at Ruby, whose quest for information surrounding the death of her parents leads her to believe that her new caretakers may have played a part in the accident.Due to the revelations the trailer makes, the movie loses its surprise factor, something it considerably suffers from. It gives away the fact that the Glasses are out to attain the childrens' inheritance to pay off loan sharks, therefore diminishing the effect this would have had it been left a surprise. Not only that, but it gives away many plot twists, including the finale, which begins by denying the heroine the right to take part in the final confrontation, and then resurrects the villain once more so that she can.Still, I found much of the film to be fitfully interesting, due to the level of suspense the movie is able to achieve. Ruby's search for clues provides some very tense moments, such as a scene in which she sends an email to her parents' former legal consultant, only to discover the next day that her AOL account is closed. Was it closed by Terry, or because the account was not paid off due to her parents' death? Terry also provides her with an English report that she believes is his original work, though it turns out to be that of a published author, landing her in the hot seat at school.Scenes like these manage to create a sense of slight psychological fear, while resurrecting the movie from a certain downfall. The movie also hits a high note by sticking to slow-building suspense rather than cheap shocks. So many teenage thrillers latch on to the old-school tricks of bloody gore and quick jumps, but &quot;The Glass House&quot; manages to create an atmosphere that gets under your skin just enough to keep you on the edge of your seat for much of the story.The cast also brings the movie to a high point, featuring commendable performances all around. Leelee Sobieski rises above most actresses her age, instilling a bravery and strength in her character that makes her strong and believable. Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard are fitfully mysterious as the Glasses, and, in some cases, almost spine-tingling. The interaction between the cast makes a sometimes silly story easy to stomach, especially the film's final resolution.&quot;The Glass House&quot; manages to stray from the usual violent gore and gruesome bloodshed that permeates many modern teenage thrillers, and gives us a story that provides some good suspense and fine performances. The trailer is a giveaway, though, and will diminish most of the film's effect for those who like to be left in the dark. But, put that aside, and you'll find that there's more to this movie than its previews reveal.",4,"Despite revealing previews, &quot;The Glass House&quot; delivers.",1000857600,"09 19, 2001",2001,3960,"['Trailers', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'movies', 'days', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'secrets', 'so', 'impact', 'actual', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'weakened', 'quot', 'Glass', 'House', 'quot', 'exception', 'trailer', 'movie', 'secrets', 'suspense', 'out', 'unscathed', 'may', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'getting', 'quite', 'ride', 'uniquely', 'stylish', 'teenage', 'thriller.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'Ruby', 'Baker', 'who', 'typical', 'teenager', 'going', 'prep', 'school', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'sneaking', 'house', 'night', 'night', 'parents', '20th', 'wedding', 'anniversary', 'home', 'discover', 'killed', 'car', 'wreck', 'leaving', 'young', 'brother', 'Rhett', 'care', 'former', 'next-door', 'neighbors', 'Terry', 'Erin', 'Glass', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Soon', 'funeral', 'Malibu', 'beginning', 'whole', 'new', 'life.The', 'Glass', 'house', 'made', 'much', 'glass', 'inside', 'providing', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'constantly', 'uneasy', 'get-go', 'Ruby', 'feeling', 'being', 'watched', 'fact', 'new', 'guardians', 'continuously', 'shower', 'gifts', 'more', 'purchase', 'trust', 'months', 'go', 'things', 'begin', 'lose', 'luster', 'Terry', 'make', 'not-so-subtle', 'passes', 'Ruby', 'quest', 'information', 'surrounding', 'death', 'parents', 'believe', 'new', 'caretakers', 'may', 'have', 'played', 'part', 'accident.Due', 'revelations', 'trailer', 'movie', 'surprise', 'factor', 'something', 'considerably', 'away', 'fact', 'Glasses', 'are', 'attain', 'childrens', 'inheritance', 'pay', 'off', 'loan', 'sharks', 'therefore', 'diminishing', 'effect', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'surprise', 'Not', 'only', 'away', 'many', 'plot', 'twists', 'including', 'finale', 'denying', 'heroine', 'right', 'take', 'part', 'final', 'confrontation', 'then', 'villain', 'once', 'more', 'so', 'found', 'much', 'film', 'be', 'fitfully', 'interesting', 'due', 'level', 'suspense', 'movie', 'able', 'achieve', 'Ruby', 'search', 'clues', 'very', 'tense', 'moments', 'such', 'scene', 'email', 'parents', 'former', 'legal', 'consultant', 'only', 'discover', 'next', 'day', 'AOL', 'account', 'closed', 'Was', 'closed', 'Terry', 'account', 'was', 'not', 'paid', 'off', 'due', 'parents', 'death', 'Terry', 'also', 'English', 'report', 'original', 'work', 'out', 'be', 'published', 'author', 'landing', 'hot', 'seat', 'school.Scenes', 'manage', 'create', 'sense', 'slight', 'psychological', 'fear', 'resurrecting', 'movie', 'certain', 'downfall', 'movie', 'also', 'high', 'note', 'sticking', 'slow-building', 'suspense', 'rather', 'cheap', 'shocks', 'So', 'many', 'teenage', 'thrillers', 'latch', 'old-school', 'tricks', 'bloody', 'gore', 'quick', 'jumps', 'quot', 'Glass', 'House', 'quot', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'skin', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'much', 'story.The', 'cast', 'also', 'movie', 'high', 'point', 'featuring', 'commendable', 'performances', 'around', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'most', 'actresses', 'age', 'instilling', 'bravery', 'strength', 'character', 'strong', 'believable', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'are', 'fitfully', 'mysterious', 'Glasses', 'cases', 'almost', 'spine-tingling', 'interaction', 'cast', 'sometimes', 'silly', 'story', 'easy', 'stomach', 'especially', 'film', 'final', 'resolution.', 'quot', 'Glass', 'House', 'quot', 'stray', 'usual', 'violent', 'gore', 'gruesome', 'bloodshed', 'many', 'modern', 'teenage', 'thrillers', 'story', 'good', 'suspense', 'fine', 'performances', 'trailer', 'giveaway', 'will', 'diminish', 'most', 'film', 'effect', 'who', 'like', 'be', 'left', 'dark', 'put', 'aside', ""'ll"", 'find', 'more', 'movie', 'previews', 'reveal']",N/A

680439,A31YZPP738T2EB,B00005RYKU,"Dustin Dunaway ""Cool Channel Films""","[5, 5]","This is the kind of movie I'd expect to see on HBO some night starring Elizabeth Berkley and Lance Henrikson, not coming to a theatre near me with Leelee Sobieski and Stellen Skaarsgard.  Okay, I'd trade Stellen for Lance everyday of the week and twice on Sunday, but you get the idea.Ruby (Sobieski) is a fun-loving normal teen until her parents' untimely demise in a car accident.  Along with her brother, she is sent to live with the Glasses...Glass's...Glassesses.  Whatever.  You can probably guess if you've seen these kinds of movies that they appear normal at first but after a while Mrs. Glass (Diane Lane) starts to look like an obsessive flake and Mr. Glass (Skaarsgard) starts to look like a leering, horny, letch.  Of course, no one will believe Ruby when she tells them.  You probably could guess that.  The whole thing reaches its conclusion in a ludicrous car battle between Leelee and Stellan (in full Jason-you-can't-kill-him mode) and some guys that Stellan owes money to thrown in for fodder.Let's do a post-mortem.  There's nothing really wrong with The Glass House (not in a Freddie Got Fingered way).  It's just kinda blah.  The only reason I feel an ounce of sympathy for Ruby is because she's played by Sobieski who could bring warmth to a Hillary Clinton biography.  Sorry, Hill.  Stellan is good, but not as good as in Insomnia.  And why put Diane Lane in this movie and give her so little to do.  Jennifer Rubin could have played the exact same role just as effectively (and probably a lot cheaper).The place where this movie really excels and separates itself from the made-for-cable stuff you see on HBO is the cinematography.  The whole movie just looks amazing.  The Glass's house, while luxurious, is cold and forbidding (just like the Glasses).

Usually, these films show things going fine, and small things start happening to make the heroes start wondering what they got themselves into.  This movie doesn't waste time with such formalities.The plot concerns a slilghtly rebellious teenager and her younger brother all of a sudden becoming orphans.  They are immediately given sympathetic offers of help from all sides by various relatives and acquaintences.  Problem is that each offer seems to come with a leering or menacing look from the offerer, which naturally makes her more uncomfortable.For whatever reason, they choose to come live with a couple who seem to be a friend of the family, even after getting an offer from a blood relative.  Maybe it's because the friends of the family live in a multi-million, state-of-the-art, everything-always-in-its-place ...[sea-side] mansion.  But instead of at least appearing like a decent deal from the beginning, the couple seems creepy right from the start. ...And the couple is not just plain creepy.

Skarsgard and Lane play a wealthy couple who become the legal guardians of 2 teenagers when their parents are killed in a car crash. For some reason that is conveniently overlooked by the script, the fact that Skarsgard and Lane are 2 psychos is never realized by these parents, who have presumably known them for a long time. But of course, what place does logic have in this movie after all?While the performances are all good, the actors can only do so much with the terrible script they're given to work with. Every plot ""twist"" can be seen coming a mile away. Some scenes even exceed the point of absurdity, case in point: when Skarsgard is able to take out an experienced police officer and then steal his gun. Go insult our intelligence somewhere else.And what's with all the product placement? This probably earned the movie more revenue than box office sales. Shameless.If there's any saving grace to this movie, it is Leelee Sobieski, although it's a shame that her breakout role was in this turkey. She deserves a script that equals her talent.

It seems that every young actress that starts out innocent these days must soon get corrupted (or fade into oblivion). Wasn't Leelee Sobieski so lovably sweet and innocent in DEEP IMPACT? Then her innocence acquired a put-upon edge in NEVER BEEN KISSED. Still good and likeable. But after that came the seemingly obligatory squandering of innocence. For Leelee that lurid rite of passage was exceptioally harsh and gratuitous, in a bit part disjunct from the rest of the movie in EYES WIDE SHUT. Ever since then her characters seem to have an inexorable element of sniveling brat, too potent to be completely eclipsed by heavy plot elements making her a put-upon character, whether playing a terminally ill girl in HERE ON EARTH or playing a victim of a plot most sinister in the present movie. The movie title is a double entendre; Glass is both a prominent material in the title house's construction and the name of it's residents. Mr. Glass is played by Stellan Skarsgrd, who, if not in danger of becoming typecast already, certainly is after this movie. He's a relative of Leelee's character, Ruby, and becoms her guardian after her parents die in a car crash. At first at least, Mr Glass seems a put-upon character. Early on we see him being beaten up by obviously unsavory characters, loan sharks as it turns out. How then do we want to see the movie develop from this point? Well, for me, not exactly as it in fact does develop. There may be overkill in some characterizations. And what looks like the developing plot tensions may end up so eclipsed and overwhelmed as to be forgotten. That's not exactly what I wanted. A little bit more of things being what they seemed in the right places would have made it more to my liking.

It's certainly not a horrible movie; it's a decent film though.  The story line was actually fairly decent regardless of how implausible, but I don't usually go to the movies to see reality, I exist in reality and I know what it's like.  If I want reality I watch documentaries.  Anyway, I have tried to curb my overwhelming bias for Leelee Sobieski in my rating.  She's one of the three actresses I simply adore looking at and watching in general.  So it really didn't matter if the rest the cast wasn't very good, I probably would've enjoyed watching it anyway... yes, I did try to curb this bias in my rating and look at the movie as a whole.The basic premise of the film is based around two kids, Ruby Baker (Leelee) and her brother, which inherited a lot of money from their dead parents.  Their guardian, Terry Glass (Skarsgaard), (unbeknownst to others) borrowed a lot of money from loan sharks, so now he wants the kids' money to pay it off.  He tries to weasel his way through the movie to get the cash any way he can.  The movie is classified as a suspense/thriller, so I'm assuming people can guess where that all goes towards the end.  It's actually a lot better than the quick overview sounds and a lot of this has to do with the interaction between Sobieski and Skarsgaard, who, in my opinion, gave the best performances in the film.  Luckily most of film is centered on them, and thus, the general lack of the other characters is made up for.Her brother was incredibly annoying throughout the film, but he was supposed to play the role of the annoying little brother, so I suppose he succeeded.  For some reason I just plain wasn't into his acting, it felt kind of forced a lot of the times (then again, he is young and not a major character).  Terry's wife, played by Diane Lane, simply listlessly goes through this film, which, again, I think her character was supposed to do.  She wasn't a major presence in the film so her presence didn't get annoying, but at least her acting performance was more convincing.  I will say that I did enjoy the end of the movie.  It was only semi-expected on my behalf.  I kind of figured out what would happen by the end, but the way they executed it was actually pretty interesting, so it definitely didn't disappoint on that level.I don't think anyone would consider this one of the best movies ever, but I think most people will find some general merit in it.  It's a pretty decent story that keeps you interested throughout the whole movie with a good amount of intrigue to keep you guessing at some things during the film.  And if none of that really gets you there's a solid five minute scene of Leelee swimming in a pool in a pretty small bikini.  That alone has to be worth at least one or two stars in my book.

I love when the house is dark becuase it adds to the mystery. This film had a great cast. Ruby(LeeLee Sobieski), Rhett(Trevor Morgan), Terry Glass(Stellan Skarsgard), and Erin Glass(Diane Lane). Leelee Sobieski is a great rising actress who is sure to reach the top one day. Trevor Morgan is also pretty good who starred in Jurassic Park 3 and The Patriot.The DVD is pretty good but I was disappointed because there was only one deleted scence and deleted scenes are always my favorite to watch. The picture is perfectly clear throughout the whole movie and the sound is so amazingly great is unbelieveable to your ears.The movie is about the Baker Family. They are ovioulsy a loving family and a family like everyone else. Mr. and Mrs. Baker are a loving couple who care so much about their kids. Ruby and Rhett Baker are like any other kids. They fight. Ruby and her friends stay out at night and Ruby smokes behind her parents back. The night of her parents anniversy Ruby is out late again. When she steps out of the car she smells like smoke so she sprays herself with perfume. When she turns the corner to her house she sees police. She automaticlly thinks her parents called them because they were worried about her. In her house she finds out that her parents were in a car crash and they died. After hearing all this she faints from shock and horror.It then shows her at their funeral. When the priest is done speaking he lets Rhett say a few words but Rhett breaks sown in tears. The Glasses rush up to assist him and Mr. Glass talks about the Bakers for a minute. When outside Ruby is approached by their Uncle Jack who they haven't seen since they were kids. He says that if they ever need any help they can just call him. When Ruby gets home she talks with Mr. Alvin Begleiter who was their parents trust agent. He says that her parents said that if anything ever happend to them that they would trust the Glasses to take care of them. He gives Ruby his card then leaves as Mr. Glass enters. Ruby thanks Mr. Glass. In the nxt scene Ruby and Rhett are moving out of their house to go live with the Glasses. When they arrive at the Glasses house they are surprised. Their house is huge and almost everything is glass. When they are shown their room they are sort of disappointed because they have to share a room. But they get over it because at least the Glasses accepted them.As the movie goes on Ruby finds out horrible things about the Glasses. She discovers their terrible secrets and gets really nervous and afraid. I don't want to tell you anymore because this movie is so phenomehaly great.

Things get creepy right away, as Mr. and Mrs. Glass's veneer of friendliness begins to fade away and their true colors appear. Mr. Glass seems to have more than fatherly intentions towards Ruby and Mrs. Glass is a drug addict (although she says she is a diabetic...uh-huh, sure..) They are far from the compassionate caretakers they pretend to be and their motive is greed- pure and simple. The children have inherited a fortune and the Glasses need money. Badly.Unfortunately, the promising setup falls flat. Leelee Sobieski, a capable actress in other movies, is sorely miscast in this one. Her continually sullen dimeanor makes it hard to warm up to her. In fact, no one in this movie is particularly watchable or likeable.Evem worse the plot has more holes than a sieve and isn't scarey as much as it is just plain silly.

680464,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005RYKU,Lawyeraau,"[17, 22]","This is an enjoyable, though predictable, thriller that seems more like a made for television movie rather than a motion picture made as a feature film release for the big screen. This is not entirely surprising, as it is directed by Daniel Sackman, a veteran television director.The plot is fairly straightforward. Sixteen year old Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobielski) and her brother, eleven year old Rhett (Trevor Morgan)), are living the lives of normal, carefree kids with their loving parents, Grace (Rita Wilson) and David Baker (Michael O'Keefe). The world, as they know it, comes crashing down on them when their parents unexpectedly die in what appears to be a routine car accident. The family lawyer, Alvin Bergletter (Bruce Dern),  informs the children that the terms of their parents' have left them wealthy and in the care and custody of former neighbors, Erin (Diane Lane) and Terry Glass (Stellan Skarsgard).Before you know it, Ruby and Trevor are esconced in the Glass Malibu home, a huge, luxurious, all glass structure. Immediately, the viewer senses something is wrong, as, amidst all this room and spaciousness, Ruby and Trevor are forced to share a bedroom. A series of unsettling events serve to make Ruby suspicious of the motives of Erin and Terry Glass and cause her to make unwelcome inquiries into the deaths of her parents. What she discovers, however, comes as no surprise to the discerning viewer, who should have little difficulty in figuring out what is going on.The performances, by and large, are adequate. Leelee Sobielski is  somewhat wooden in her portrayal of Ruby, mistaking a deadpan expression for seriousness of purpose. Trevor Morgan is merely annoying, but this is brought about by a script that requires him to utter the word, ""Sweet"", everytime he is pleased with something. Their characterization of the children makes it difficult for the viewer to warm up to either of them.Diane Lane sleepwalks through her part, which may be fitting considering her specific personal problem in the film. Stellan Skarsgard is appropriately menacing in a very controlled way. His is one of the better performances. The only odd note is that an accent of sorts seems to occassionally slip out, which is somewhat jarring. Bruce Dern is excellent as the family attorney, as is Chris Noth in the small role of the children's estranged uncle.The DVD provides a very clear, high quality picture and sound. Other than the usual commentary and filmmaker interviews, the DVD does not offer all that much. For those who enjoy the inclusion of deleted scenes, this DVD offers exactly one such scene.",3,PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN GLASS HOUSES...,1026259200,"07 10, 2002",2002,2615,"['enjoyable', 'predictable', 'thriller', 'more', 'made', 'television', 'movie', 'rather', 'motion', 'picture', 'made', 'feature', 'film', 'release', 'big', 'screen', 'not', 'entirely', 'surprising', 'directed', 'Daniel', 'Sackman', 'veteran', 'television', 'director.The', 'plot', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'Sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'Ruby', 'Baker', 'Leelee', 'Sobielski', 'brother', 'eleven', 'year', 'old', 'Rhett', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'are', 'living', 'lives', 'normal', 'carefree', 'kids', 'loving', 'parents', 'Grace', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'David', 'Baker', 'Michael', ""O'Keefe"", 'world', 'know', 'crashing', 'down', 'when', 'parents', 'unexpectedly', 'die', 'what', 'be', 'routine', 'car', 'accident', 'family', 'lawyer', 'Alvin', 'Bergletter', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'children', 'terms', 'parents', 'have', 'left', 'wealthy', 'care', 'custody', 'former', 'neighbors', 'Erin', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Terry', 'Glass', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'know', 'Ruby', 'Trevor', 'are', 'esconced', 'Glass', 'Malibu', 'home', 'huge', 'luxurious', 'glass', 'structure', 'Immediately', 'viewer', 'something', 'wrong', 'room', 'spaciousness', 'Ruby', 'Trevor', 'are', 'forced', 'share', 'bedroom', 'series', 'unsettling', 'events', 'serve', 'make', 'Ruby', 'suspicious', 'motives', 'Erin', 'Terry', 'Glass', 'cause', 'make', 'unwelcome', 'inquiries', 'deaths', 'parents', 'What', 'however', 'surprise', 'discerning', 'viewer', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'little', 'difficulty', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'performances', 'large', 'are', 'adequate', 'Leelee', 'Sobielski', 'somewhat', 'wooden', 'portrayal', 'Ruby', 'mistaking', 'deadpan', 'expression', 'seriousness', 'purpose', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'merely', 'annoying', 'brought', 'about', 'script', 'utter', 'word', 'Sweet', 'everytime', 'pleased', 'something', 'characterization', 'children', 'difficult', 'viewer', 'warm', 'up', 'them.Diane', 'Lane', 'sleepwalks', 'part', 'may', 'be', 'fitting', 'considering', 'specific', 'personal', 'problem', 'film', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'appropriately', 'menacing', 'very', 'controlled', 'way', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'only', 'odd', 'note', 'accent', 'sorts', 'occassionally', 'slip', 'out', 'somewhat', 'jarring', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'excellent', 'family', 'attorney', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'small', 'role', 'children', 'estranged', 'uncle.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'clear', 'high', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'Other', 'usual', 'commentary', 'filmmaker', 'interviews', 'DVD', 'not', 'offer', 'much', 'who', 'enjoy', 'inclusion', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'exactly', 'one', 'such', 'scene']",N/A

680468,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005RYKU,Matthew Horner,"[3, 3]","The problem with titling a movie The Glass House is that it tempts critics and viewers to throw verbal stones at it. I will try to avoid that temptation, as the movie already has plenty of cracks in it.Strong thrillers are generally those in which the events are fairly plausible -- or at least they are believable enough for you not to question them until after the movie is over. A decent one is one in which the plot is silly but so much fun you put up with it. A mediocre thriller, such as The Glass House, is marred by plot holes so big that they bug you. You can't stop thinking about them. You begin to see the characters' actions as simply responses to the script's absurd demands. The actors start looking like people just working for a paycheck.Sixteen year old Ruby [Leelee Sobieski] and her brother, Rhett [Trevor Morgan], who is twelve, are orphaned when their parents are killed in an auto accident. Their parents' will leaves the kids well provided for, but their choice of guardians is not good. They picked Terry and Erin Glass [Stellan Skarsgaard and Diane Lane], supposedly their best friends. The couple moves Ruby and Rhett into their vast, ultramodern house in California's chic Malibu. The house is all glass, stainless steel, and cold blues, never a good sign for movie orphans. The first weird thing the Glasses do is to house the children together in the same room. Ruby immediately picks up on the strange vibes, while Rhett remains clueless throughout the movie, apparently having suffered permanent brain damage from too much Nintendo. Terry puts the moves on Ruby, while Erin, a pain management doctor, spends her time off shooting up drugs. Could they be after the kid's inheritance? Ruby tries to get help, but nobody believes her. They don't believe her either because the script tells them not to or because she frowns and mumbles all the time.That part about having the same bedroom, which occurs early in the movie, was the first plot hole that threw me. The reason the Glasses do this is never addressed. It's not like there aren't a dozen bedrooms in the place. If the couple is plotting to do away with the kids, wouldn't having everything appear to be normal make sense? Why start off by alarming them? When Ruby goes to the family attorney, he points out that, if they are taken away from the Glasses, they will be made wards of the state. Why? Ruby and the audience find out at the start that she has an uncle in Chicago. Sure, until the funeral, he hasn't been to visit in ten years, but it's obvious he's a nice, caring guy. Best or worst of all is why the parents would entrust their children with the Glasses in the first place. They're obviously fruitcakes, good friends or not.Sobieski, a young Helen Hunt look-a-like, is a fine actress, but she is lost in this material. The pain on her face looks as if it came from long fights with the director over her character's motivation. As the Glasses, Lane and Skarsgaard are great in their quieter moments but are laughable in the scenes where they must be over the top. Bruce Dern has a nice cameo as a sinister lawyer, as does Kathy Bates as a social worker.The photography is first-rate and is the movie's strongest asset. The music is properly chilling. The plot's basic elements have successfully worked in other thrillers. It's too bad the writers' didn't think to watch them first.",2,Broken Script = Broken 'Glass',1015718400,"03 10, 2002",2002,3382,"['problem', 'titling', 'movie', 'Glass', 'House', 'critics', 'viewers', 'throw', 'verbal', 'stones', 'will', 'try', 'avoid', 'temptation', 'movie', 'already', 'plenty', 'cracks', 'it.Strong', 'thrillers', 'are', 'generally', 'events', 'are', 'fairly', 'plausible', 'least', 'are', 'believable', 'enough', 'not', 'question', 'movie', 'over', 'decent', 'one', 'one', 'plot', 'silly', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'put', 'up', 'mediocre', 'thriller', 'such', 'Glass', 'House', 'marred', 'plot', 'holes', 'so', 'big', 'bug', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'begin', 'see', 'characters', 'actions', 'simply', 'script', 'absurd', 'demands', 'actors', 'start', 'looking', 'people', 'just', 'working', 'paycheck.Sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'Ruby', '[', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', ']', 'brother', 'Rhett', '[', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', ']', 'who', 'twelve', 'are', 'orphaned', 'when', 'parents', 'are', 'killed', 'auto', 'accident', 'parents', 'will', 'kids', 'well', 'provided', 'choice', 'guardians', 'not', 'good', 'picked', 'Terry', 'Erin', 'Glass', '[', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgaard', 'Diane', 'Lane', ']', 'supposedly', 'best', 'friends', 'couple', 'Ruby', 'Rhett', 'vast', 'ultramodern', 'house', 'California', 'chic', 'Malibu', 'house', 'glass', 'stainless', 'steel', 'cold', 'blues', 'never', 'good', 'sign', 'movie', 'orphans', 'first', 'weird', 'thing', 'Glasses', 'do', 'house', 'children', 'together', 'same', 'room', 'Ruby', 'immediately', 'up', 'strange', 'vibes', 'Rhett', 'clueless', 'movie', 'apparently', 'having', 'suffered', 'permanent', 'brain', 'damage', 'too', 'much', 'Nintendo', 'Terry', 'moves', 'Ruby', 'Erin', 'pain', 'management', 'doctor', 'time', 'off', 'shooting', 'up', 'drugs', 'Could', 'be', 'kid', 'inheritance', 'Ruby', 'get', 'help', 'nobody', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'script', 'not', 'frowns', 'mumbles', 'time.That', 'part', 'having', 'same', 'bedroom', 'early', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'plot', 'hole', 'threw', 'reason', 'Glasses', 'do', 'never', 'addressed', 'not', 'are', ""n't"", 'dozen', 'bedrooms', 'place', 'couple', 'plotting', 'do', 'away', 'kids', 'would', ""n't"", 'having', 'everything', 'appear', 'be', 'normal', 'make', 'sense', 'Why', 'start', 'off', 'alarming', 'When', 'Ruby', 'family', 'attorney', 'out', 'are', 'taken', 'away', 'Glasses', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'wards', 'state', 'Why', 'Ruby', 'audience', 'find', 'out', 'start', 'uncle', 'Chicago', 'Sure', 'funeral', ""n't"", 'been', 'visit', 'ten', 'years', 'obvious', 'nice', 'caring', 'guy', 'Best', 'worst', 'why', 'parents', 'would', 'entrust', 'children', 'Glasses', 'first', 'place', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'fruitcakes', 'good', 'friends', 'not.Sobieski', 'young', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'look-a-like', 'fine', 'actress', 'lost', 'material', 'pain', 'face', 'came', 'long', 'fights', 'director', 'character', 'motivation', 'Glasses', 'Lane', 'Skarsgaard', 'are', 'great', 'quieter', 'moments', 'are', 'laughable', 'scenes', 'where', 'must', 'be', 'top', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'nice', 'cameo', 'sinister', 'lawyer', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'social', 'worker.The', 'photography', 'first-rate', 'movie', 'strongest', 'asset', 'music', 'properly', 'chilling', 'plot', 'basic', 'elements', 'have', 'successfully', 'worked', 'other', 'thrillers', 'too', 'bad', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'watch', 'first']",N/A

Into this pristine setting come two youngsters whose parents were tragically killed in an automobile accident.  In their will, they stated they wanted their old friends, the Glasses, to look after them.  All is not what it seems at first and soon a more incendiary plot is revealed.What I really liked most about this film is the precisioned and passionated performance by Leelee Sobieski (Joy Ride).  This young actress is not only a lovely woman, but she seemed to understand the nuances of her role and even as it plummets into shameless melodrama by the end, Leelee stays with it and elevates it above what it could have been under someone else's control.  Diane Lane foreshadowed her work in UNFAITHFUL in her role as the addicted physician, although her role gets backseat most of the time.  Young Trevor Morgan is very good as the eleven year old, and Stellan Skarsgard, while menacing and vile, never seemed to fully show us his greed and nastiness.  Cameo-type roles are taken by Chris Noth as the children's distant uncle; and Michael O'Keefe and an uncredited Rita Wilson as the doomed parents.Moody and manipulative, THE GLASS HOUSE nonetheless entertains and it's mostly because of Leelee.",5,THE TRANSPARENT MAN AND WIFE,1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,1353,"['GLASS', 'HOUSE', 'metaphorically', 'interesting', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'building', 'mostly', 'glass', 'owners', 'house', 'are', 'Terry', 'Erin', 'Glass', 'Into', 'pristine', 'setting', 'come', 'two', 'youngsters', 'parents', 'were', 'tragically', 'killed', 'automobile', 'accident', 'will', 'stated', 'wanted', 'old', 'friends', 'Glasses', 'look', 'not', 'what', 'first', 'soon', 'more', 'incendiary', 'plot', 'revealed.What', 'really', 'liked', 'most', 'film', 'precisioned', 'passionated', 'performance', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'Joy', 'Ride', 'young', 'actress', 'not', 'only', 'lovely', 'woman', 'seemed', 'understand', 'nuances', 'role', 'even', 'shameless', 'melodrama', 'end', 'Leelee', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'else', 'control', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'foreshadowed', 'work', 'UNFAITHFUL', 'role', 'addicted', 'physician', 'role', 'backseat', 'most', 'time', 'Young', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'very', 'good', 'eleven', 'year', 'old', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'menacing', 'vile', 'never', 'seemed', 'fully', 'show', 'greed', 'nastiness', 'Cameo-type', 'roles', 'are', 'taken', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'children', 'distant', 'uncle', 'Michael', ""O'Keefe"", 'uncredited', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'doomed', 'parents.Moody', 'manipulative', 'THE', 'GLASS', 'HOUSE', 'nonetheless', 'entertains', 'mostly', 'Leelee']",N/A

I expected THE GLASS HOUSE to be a pretty silly movie as the opinions of the majority of critics were that. I'll have to be different this time and say I highly enjoyed this nicely done thriller. It has some clich&eacute;d/contrived moments and a couple of plot holes, and it could've done without the Stellan Skarsgaard-business-deal-going-wrong idea but the visuals in this movie are outstanding, with many shots suggesting something may be lurking or watching. I loved how the movie kept you in suspense the whole way through and keeps you guessing. All around a well-directed and misunderstood chiller.THE SPECIAL FEATURES: This could've been a lot better. We get great commentary from the writer and the director who help you to understand the ideas behind the shots, angles etc. There are 2 trailers, one for this film and one for URBAN LEGEND. We also get cast and crew filmographies and one deleted scene. There could've been heaps more deleted scenes because during the movie the director says things like &quot;this scene was actually after a scene we deleted&quot; and there is heaps of unused footage that you see in the trailer. That really ticked me off. What's up with just giving us ONE?

680476,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005RYKU,Only-A-Child,"[2, 2]","""The Glass House"" (2001) is one of those films that you enjoy during the viewing thanks to good directing, good technical film-making (production design-nicely staged action sequences-odd camera angles), and convincing dialogue; but look back at feeling generally dissatisfied. In part this is due to the moronic final ten minutes but then you realize that the premise itself is the real problem. You don't mind suspending disbelief during the viewing but afterward you resent the fact that a less elaborate script would have made your efforts unnecessary.The film is yet another example of Hollywood's ability, given a relatively large budget $20-30 Million, to put together a good-looking and visually believable suspense movie. It brings skilled technique to a plot that's a foregone conclusion, so the viewer must wait patiently for the characters to catch up.For film buffs (those who like to read a film) there is a fairly ambitious subtext inside ""The Glass House""; working on both conscious and sub-conscious levels. Warm (orange tones) lighting for the safe/secure scenes and cold (blue tones) lighting for the places where things are off-kilter. The Glasses (Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard) literally live in a ""glass"" house above the Malibu beach. The theme, that nothing is what it appears to be, is supported by a production design of reflective surfaces; mirrors, glass, and water (its always raining) that distort the images. Mrs. Glass is a physician in a pain center who is secretly addicted to her own medications. Mr. Glass runs a seemingly thriving limo service transporting famous clients behind smoked glass windows.There are several references to ""Hamlet"" with Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobieski) essentially in the role of the Melancholy Dane. The writer must have had this linked together much better in the screenplay but apparently several key elements of this dynamic never made it into production. This story is told entirely from Hamlet's point of view, a Hamlet who is frustratingly slow on the uptake and unable to make up her mind. And the viewer is supposed to be wondering what is real, what is wrongly perceived, and what is paranoid illusion. They even try to fool you with a dream sequence involving the return of Ruby's mother. Fortunately Sobieski (who looks like a young Helen Hunt) is an excellent actress and up to the challenge. Her performance (she is in every scene) keeps you focused on her story. The many scenes between her and Skarsgard are the film's real strength; they must carry the film since no one else in the cast is much of a factor.The film opens with a ""film within a film"" device, which turns out to be a horror film, late- night viewing for Ruby and her rave-loving high school friends. This is an early clue to the ""nothing is what it seems to be"" theme. It turns out that Ruby is quite a party animal and has been successfully deceiving her parents about her nocturnal activities. This night she returns home to find police cars parked outside her house. Believing herself finally busted she enters the house only to be told that her parent's were both killed in a car accident earlier that evening. This sets the stage for life with the Glass family, a childless couple who were friends with her parents. You instantly know that they are odd because the director works so hard to make them appear normal.Ruby and her little brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) leave the San Fernando Valley to live with the Glass's in their expensive hilltop house. Can you say: ""Hansel and Gretel in a Gingerbread cottage""? Things are weird from the start as the two children must share a room. Whatever the original rationale for this idea might have been got lost in the deleted scenes of the screenplay and it just seems silly and illogical (given the Glasses long-term plans). I assume that it was originally included to reinforce the idea that living in a glass house offers no privacy but who knows.From this point a lot of stuff happens which can be taken in several different ways with the director constantly laying misdirection. Wesley Strick's screenplay gets way too elaborate and cute with this stuff and the film must rely on many convenient coincidences to advance the storyline. But since this starts at about the midway point its too late to stop viewing now. Listening to the Strick's commentary track on the DVD it is clear that there was considerable meddling with the original story by producers, dumbing down the more intellectually compelling elements.Still little would have been lost and the overall credulity would have benefited by a less ambitious conspiracy, there was no reason for the parent's deaths to have been anything but an accident; it would have raised the film's IQ if the Glasses had been opportunists rather than conspirators. And the attempt at irony with the brake fluid would have worked better if Mr. Glass had been knocked out and put in his car; only to wake up as it is speeding down the road.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",3,Two Very Nice Performances,1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,5026,"['Glass', 'House', '2001', 'one', 'films', 'enjoy', 'viewing', 'thanks', 'good', 'directing', 'good', 'technical',

Besides, it's mainly for entertainment and enjoyment, period. That's what Hollywood is for, right? THE GLASS HOUSE is about a teenage girl named Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) who lives with her brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan), and their parents in LA. When Ruby comes home one night to find out her parents died in a car accident, she and her brother are sent to live with the Glasses', their parents' best friends who live in Maliabu.

680481,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005RYKU,Reviewer,"[3, 4]","That there is nothing new under the sun is aptly demonstrated by this suspense/thriller which, though not too original, has some good moments and boasts a terrific performance by Leelee Sobieski.  All of which makes &#8220;The Glass House,&#8221; directed by Daniel Sackheim, worth a look.  It&#8217;s a road you&#8217;ve no doubt been down before, and pretty early on you have a good idea of where it&#8217;s going to wind up; but it&#8217;s well crafted and delivered, and serves as a showcase for Sobieski, who is one of the finest young actors in the business today.When their parents are killed in a car wreck, sixteen-year-old Ruby Baker (Sobieski) and her eleven-year-old brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan), find themselves under the guardianship of Terrence and Dr. Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane), who are apparently well off financially, and have a rather nice house that sits on a cliff in Malibu, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  It&#8217;s seemingly an idyll setting, but from the moment the children move in the climate within the household seems uncomfortable to all but Rhett.  Ruby senses something disconcerting with the arrangement, but there&#8217;s not much she can do about it.  The executor of the Baker&#8217;s will, Alvin Begleiter (Bruce Dern), advises Ruby that if it doesn&#8217;t work out with Mr. and Mrs. Glass, she and Rhett would become wards of the court; not a happy prospect.  It quickly becomes apparent to Ruby, however, that there&#8217;s more than meets the eye at play here, but to whom can she turn?  And therein lies the conundrum, because the answer is a resounding &#8220;no one.&#8221;  And especially in the wake of her parent&#8217;s death, that&#8217;s a tough thing for a sixteen-year-old to have to face.  What she doesn&#8217;t know, as well, is that it&#8217;s going to get a lot worse before it gets better.Director Sackheim does a good job of keeping up the tension in his film, but it could have been more effective had he employed a bit more subtlety and nuance.  And he has a troublesome affinity for camera shots through doors that are open just a crack, which allows one character (as well as the audience) to get a glimpse of another, as well as whatever is going on in the next room.  Initially, it works; but by the end of the film the impact it affords is diluted by overkill.  Things can only go bump in the night so many times, and you can only hold your breath so many times waiting for the eavesdropper to be discovered before it becomes second nature and ceases to be effective.  Even so, these are elements that can be overlooked, however, as Sackheim does keep it all moving along at a pace that sustains interest.  But the unimaginative ending is something of a letdown, and just too pat to ultimately have much of an impact.The saving grace of the film is clearly Sobieski, who as she matures is emerging as a cross between Helen Hunt and Jodie Foster, but with a talent and style uniquely her own.  In Ruby, she delivers a well rounded, three dimensional character which, in lesser hands, could easily have fallen into stereotype.  Ruby, however, is anything but.  This is a girl who comes from privilege (money, private school), and like any normal teenager has a certain disdain for her parents.  She knows her way around and is not beneath sneaking out into uncharted territory occasionally.  Sobieski makes her extremely believable, especially in her reactions to all that happens to and around her.  The scene in which she learns of her parent&#8217;s death is played very well, very real, as are the scenes in which her suspicions become increasingly aroused.  And it&#8217;s that level of realism she attains and brings to the character that carries the film.Diane Lane, on the other hand, does not fare as well.  Her performance as Erin is passable, but fairly weak.  She fails to bring anything to the role to make her character unique; it&#8217;s as if she never quite got a handle on who this person really is that she&#8217;s trying to portray.  To be fair, she does have her moments, but overall, her work here is average, at best.In Terry, Stellan Skarsgard creates a character who is not so much sinister as down right creepy.  He lacks the menace that would&#8217;ve made Ruby&#8217;s situation scarier, but in retrospect, his character is more real because of it.  And he has a slimy leer that is so very telling in regards to who Terry is.  Some of his actions at times seem too &#8220;staged,&#8221; like when he reaches across Ruby in the car to buckle her seat belt, but that falls on Sackheim, and is certainly not a reflection on Skarsgard&#8217;s performance, which is quite convincing.The supporting cast includes Kathy Baker (Nancy Ryan), Michael O&#8217;Keefe (David Baker), Rita Wilson (Grace Baker), Chris Noth (Uncle Jack), Rachel Wilson (Hannah), Michael Paul Chan (Mr. Kim) and Carly Pope (Tasha).  Though not the greatest movie ever made, this one still has something to offer by way of atmosphere, some suspense, a few thrills and a decent (if not highly original) story.  But the main thing &#8220;The Glass House&#8221; has to offer is the memorable performance by Leelee Sobieski, who takes this film to a higher level single-handedly.  In the final analysis, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward storytelling, and it is entertaining; for a thriller, you could do much worse.  And that&#8217;s the magic of the movies.",3,Sobieski Saves the Day (and the Film),1013299200,"02 10, 2002",2002,5435,"['nothing', 'new', 'sun', 'aptly', 'demonstrated', 'suspense/thriller', 'not',

680482,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005RYKU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 4]","The Glass House (Daniel Sackheim, 2001)There's a scene about two thirds of the way through The Glass House that pretty much sums up every way in which this movie went wrong. It's hard to set the scene without spoilers, but I'll attempt to do it anyway: a character has died. We know from various things, mostly a makeup job that would look appropriate in a microbudget horror film rather than a big Hollywood release, that said character has been dead for some time. Said character is found by another character. And, you know, just as character B finds character A-- who was previously quite banged around postmortem-- something character A was clutching in his/her hand is released and falls to the floor.Little stupid things like that can ruin a whole movie for me, because they tell me that the director is willing to go for the cheap shot rather than trying to keep some semblance of reality in the film. That's exactly what happens here (you see the ending coming a while before the characters do, to be sure), and it's a shame, because it turns what might have been a fun, serviceable little thriller into a waste of some incredible talent.Ruby (Joan of Arc's Leelee Sobieski) and Rhett (The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio's Trevor Morgan) have recently been orphaned. The estate's executor, Begleiter (the mighty Bruce Dern) has decided to allow the petition of family friends Terry (Insomnia's Stellan Skarsgard) and Erin (Unfaithful's Diane Lane) Glass to take the kids in, over the objections of their Uncle Jack (Law and Order's Chris Noth). All seems to be going well, but Ruby gets a weird vibe from Terry on a pretty regular basis, and begins to think that there might be some ulterior motive to the Glass' offer to take them in.This is a great cast. A great cast. Skarsgard and Lane have been among the highlights of the acting world for a lot of years between them, and Sobieski is a fast-rising star (or would be, if she'd keep her participation in such dogs as Eyes Wide Shut to a minimum). And, of course, there's Bruce Dern, whose very name inspires some film critics to cower in their respective corners, gibbering. So how did Sackheim, a very capable TV director who's worked on some of the best series on television (House, The X-Files, Millennium, Law and Order, et al.), and screenwriter Wesley Strick (True Believer, the 1991 adaptation of Cape Fear, et al.) manage to bungle this as badly as they did?I tend to lay the blame on Sackheim. Tricks like the hand thing in the first paragraph of this review play a lot better on the small screen than they do on the large screen; that's the sort of controlled cheesiness that made The X-Files so much fun to watch over the years. But then you look at Strick's fantastic track record before this movie, and you look afterwards and see Doom . What went wrong?Whichever way you look at it, though, there's wasted talent to go around here. There is some fantastic set design; one wishes as much attention to detail had been paid to letting some fine actors do their thing in front of it. **",2,So botched.,1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,3059,"['Glass', 'House', 'Daniel', 'Sackheim', '2001', 'scene', 'two', 'thirds', 'way', 'Glass', 'House', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'way', 'movie', 'went', 'wrong', 'hard', 'set', 'scene', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'attempt', 'do', 'anyway', 'character', 'died', 'know', 'various', 'things', 'mostly', 'makeup', 'job', 'would', 'look', 'appropriate', 'microbudget', 'horror', 'film', 'rather', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'release', 'said', 'character', 'been', 'dead', 'time', 'Said', 'character', 'found', 'character', 'know', 'just', 'character', 'B', 'character', 'A', 'who', 'was', 'previously', 'quite', 'banged', 'postmortem', 'something', 'character', 'A', 'was', 'clutching', 'his/her', 'hand', 'released', 'floor.Little', 'stupid', 'things', 'can', 'ruin', 'whole', 'movie', 'tell', 'director', 'willing', 'go', 'cheap', 'shot', 'rather', 'trying', 'keep', 'semblance', 'reality', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'here', 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'while', 'characters', 'do', 'be', 'sure', 'shame', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'serviceable', 'little', 'thriller', 'waste', 'incredible', 'talent.Ruby', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'Rhett', 'Prize', 'Winner', 'Defiance', 'Ohio', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'have', 'recently', 'been', 'orphaned', 'estate', 'executor', 'Begleiter', 'mighty', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'decided', 'allow', 'petition', 'family', 'friends', 'Terry', 'Insomnia', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Erin', 'Unfaithful', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Glass', 'take', 'kids', 'objections', 'Uncle', 'Jack', 'Law', 'Order', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'Ruby', 'weird', 'vibe', 'Terry', 'pretty', 'regular', 'basis', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'Glass', 'offer', 'take', 'in.This', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'cast', 'Skarsgard', 'Lane', 'have', 'been', 'highlights', 'acting', 'world', 'lot', 'years', 'Sobieski', 'fast-rising', 'star', 'would', 'be', ""'d"", 'keep', 'participation', 'such', 'dogs', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'minimum', 'course', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'very', 'name', 'film', 'critics', 'cower', 'respective', 'corners', 'gibbering', 'how', 'did', 'Sackheim', 'very', 'capable', 'TV', 'director', 'who', 'worked', 'best', 'series', 'television', 'House', 'X-Files', 'Millennium', 'Law', 'Order', 'et', 'al', 'screenwriter', 'Wesley', 'Strick', 'True', 'Believer', '1991', 'adaptation', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'al', 'manage', 'bungle', 'as', 'badly', 'did', 'tend', 'lay', 'blame', 'Sackheim', 'Tricks', 'hand', 'thing', 'first', 'paragraph', 'review', 'play', 'lot', 'better', 'small', 'screen', 'do', 'large', 'screen', 'sort', 'controlled', 'cheesiness', 'made', 'X-Files', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'years', 'then', 'look', 'Strick', 'fantastic', 'track', 'record', 'movie', 'look', 'afterwards', 'see', 'Doom', 'What', 'went', 'wrong', 'Whichever', 'way', 'look', 'though', 'wasted', 'talent', 'go', 'around', 'here', 'fantastic', 'set', 'design', 'one', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'detail', 'had', 'been', 'paid', 'letting', 'fine', 'actors', 'do', 'thing', 'front', '**']",N/A

For exactly the same reason, I watched this thriller, which turned out slightly better than what I expected.Just like her previous work ""Joy Ride,"" ""The Glass House"" works as unpretencious B-movie.  And this is not a back-handed compliment, for it generates some considerable suspence for all its ridiculous plot, which sets up its premise quickly with a orphaned Leelee's character and her younger brother, who are to be adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Glass.  At first, the new life seems fine, but soon Mr. Glass starts to show his true colors.Most recommendable thing about the film is Leelee Sobieski's acting, which easily creates a likable, credible central character you can relate to.  And she even goes in for her sexy side, at one scene appearing in swimming suit (before she knew that someone is watching over her), just in case you're interested.  About other actors, I do not have much to say, except that the villains are played exactly like villains, and Bruce Dern, as everybody expects, plays his part of lawyer with a suspicious shade.  And, like me, for those who remember Diane Lane when she was a child actor, it is painful to watch some of the scenes her character is included.The shaky script has so many holes that you can pick up several points and say ""Why don't you do this or that?"" and it goes on and on, finally involves a crash scene with a high-speed cars on a mountain road, but owing to first-time feature director Daniel Sackheim (previously working for many TV series like ""X-Files"" ""ER"" and others), we anyway forget these things ... temporarily.  After all, this is a kind of entertainment that you saw in ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"" and such thrillers, and while many ridicule them on the ground of implausible situation, others love them just on the same ground.

THE GLASS HOUSE is suprisingly bland. It offers no suspense, a mediocre storyline, predictable plot -- shall I go on? It was boring OK!

I recently watched the film with a more critical eye and, though I now realize it isn't a &#34;classic&#34; in any sense of the word, I was still entertained by it.For a basic plot summary, &#34;The Glass House&#34; sees siblings Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) and Rhett (Trevor Morgan) Baker orphaned when their parents die in a car wreck.  As such, their new custodians (friends of the family) Terry (Stellan Skarsgard) and Erin (Diane Lane) Glass take them into their Malibu mansion.  Though life seems to go okay for the youngsters at first, they soon discover that living with Mr. and Mrs. Glass may not be quite as innocent as it seems.&#34;The Glass House&#34; is a movie that probably should be directed at teenagers.  The themes are quite transparent and predictable, so adult viewers will likely see right through it (not unlike the Glass house itself!).  However, teenagers will be much more willing to put aside their disbelief and just &#34;enjoy the ride&#34;.  If you can do that, this movie can suck you in.I wish I could say the acting in this movie is great, because at some parts it truly is, but the characters are so stereotypical for the thriller genre that it is tough to see them as anything but.  Sobieski probably shines brightest in the piece, as she combines patented teenage sex appeal with some solid acting chops.  Skarsgard & Lane are great actors in their own right, but (like I said) their characters are somewhat spoiled by predictability.I saw &#34;The Glass House&#34; as a teen, so it made an impact on me (hence the 4-star rating).  It probably is more of a 3-star flick, truth be told.  Yet, show it to the right audience and it can provide some decent entertainment as a thriller.",4,Makes A Great First Impression (Even More So If You Are A Teen!),1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,1832,"['initially', 'watched', '34', 'Glass', 'House', '34', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'remembered', 'being', 'solid', 'thriller', 'recently', 'watched', 'film', 'more', 'critical', 'eye', 'now', 'realize', ""n't"", '34', 'classic', '34', 'sense', 'word', 'was', 'still', 'entertained', 'it.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Glass', 'House', '34', 'sees', 'siblings', 'Ruby', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'Rhett', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'Baker', 'orphaned', 'when', 'parents', 'die', 'car', 'wreck', 'such', 'new', 'custodians', 'friends', 'family', 'Terry', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Erin', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Glass', 'take', 'Malibu', 'mansion', 'life', 'go', 'okay', 'youngsters', 'first', 'soon', 'discover', 'living', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Glass', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'as', 'innocent', '34', 'Glass', 'House', '34', 'movie', 'probably', 'should', 'be', 'directed', 'teenagers', 'themes', 'are', 'quite', 'transparent', 'predictable', 'so', 'adult', 'viewers', 'will', 'likely', 'see', 'right', 'not', 'Glass', 'house', 'However', 'teenagers', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'willing', 'put', 'aside', 'disbelief', 'just', '34', 'enjoy', 'ride', '34', 'can', 'do', 'movie', 'can', 'suck', 'in.I', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'acting', 'movie', 'great', 'parts', 'truly', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'stereotypical', 'thriller', 'genre', 'tough', 'see', 'anything', 'Sobieski', 'probably', 'brightest', 'piece', 'patented', 'teenage', 'sex', 'appeal', 'solid', 'acting', 'chops', 'Skarsgard', 'Lane', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'own', 'right', 'said', 'characters', 'are', 'somewhat', 'spoiled', 'predictability.I', 'saw', '34', 'Glass', 'House', '34', 'teen', 'made', 'impact', 'hence', '4-star', 'rating', 'probably', 'more', '3-star', 'flick', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'show', 'right', 'audience', 'can', 'provide', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'thriller']",N/A
