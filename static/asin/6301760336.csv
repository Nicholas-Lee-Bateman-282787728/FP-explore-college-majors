264370,A3H82LUT1EC655,6301760336,Erika Sorocco,"[11, 11]","Lucas is a young shepherd boy, who is blinded during a horrible winter storm. He almost loses his way after he loses his sight, but is saved by one of the sisters, Sister Theresa (voiced by Angela Lansbury), of an abbey located close by. Lucas is embraced by Sister Theresa, who allows him to stay at the abbey until Christmas. Lucas, being so entirely happy by Sister Theresa's gesture, gives her everything that he owns: his flock of sheep. That Christmas, thanks to his lovely kindness, Lucas receives one of the greatest, and most miraculous recovery ever, and also learns about the gift of love.I saw this movie on the 25 Days of Christmas on ABC Family last year, and was so touched by it, that I immediately ordered the film from Amazon.com. Lucas is a kind young boy, who has been through so much terror in his life, and deserves for something good to happen to him, and it does when he meets the wonderful Sister Theresa. Sister Theresa is a loving character, who will capture the hearts of anyone who view this film. This movie will show even the grouchiest of grinches how beautiful, and wonderful Christmas is. And prove to you that Christmas miracles do come true.

264371,A6GMEO3VRY51S,6301760336,microjoe,"[28, 28]","I reccommend this RARE one hour television special that was released in 1975 on NBC television. Made by the Rankin/Bass Studio, who specialized in stop-motion ""Animagic"" wonders. By the way, this should not be confused with the claymation special of the same name released more recently by another studio. The voices of Angela Lansbury and David Kelly are featured. This story is similar to The Little Drummer Boy in that it has a religeous or spiritual theme to it, and it helps teach kids about kindness, gratitude, sharing, and other positive values. Three diferent original songs are included.The story is: A shepherd boy named Lukas is struck by lightning and blinded, then taken in by some nuns at an abbey during the holidays. They cannot care for him forever, and he cannot tend sheep anymore so he is to go to an orphanage. He has to rescue his sheep from some wolves after some other boys let them run away. The boy gets to play the Angel in a leve re-enaction of the Nativity. After a Christmas miracle his sight is regained.While this never seems to be broadcast anymore, this is a nice film from the holiday entertainers of Rankin/Bass Studio. Their studio has brought us such memorable holiday classics such as Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey, Mad Monster Party, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, Mouse on the Mayflower, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, Jack Frost, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit, Flight of Dragons, the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, 95% of the ones we see every year. Their work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action.I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that have been released on DVD.",5,Rankin/Bass Animagic Holiday Special,1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,2003,"['reccommend', 'RARE', 'one', 'hour', 'television', 'special', 'was', 'released', '1975', 'NBC', 'television', 'Made', 'Rankin/Bass', 'Studio', 'who', 'specialized', 'stop-motion', 'Animagic', 'wonders', 'way', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'claymation', 'special', 'same', 'name', 'released', 'more', 'recently', 'studio', 'voices', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'David', 'Kelly', 'are', 'featured', 'story', 'similar', 'Little', 'Drummer', 'Boy', 'religeous', 'spiritual', 'theme', 'teach', 'kids', 'kindness', 'gratitude', 'sharing', 'other', 'positive', 'values', 'Three', 'diferent', 'original', 'songs', 'are', 'included.The', 'story', 'shepherd', 'boy', 'named', 'Lukas', 'struck', 'lightning', 'blinded', 'then', 'taken', 'nuns', 'abbey', 'holidays', 'can', 'not', 'care', 'forever', 'can', 'not', 'tend', 'sheep', 'anymore', 'so', 'go', 'orphanage', 'rescue', 'sheep', 'wolves', 'other', 'boys', 'let', 'run', 'away', 'boy', 'play', 'Angel', 'leve', 're-enaction', 'Nativity', 'Christmas', 'miracle', 'sight', 'regained.While', 'never', 'be', 'broadcast', 'anymore', 'nice', 'film', 'holiday', 'entertainers', 'Rankin/Bass', 'Studio', 'studio', 'brought', 'such', 'memorable', 'holiday', 'classics', 'such', 'Rudolph', 'Red-nosed', 'Reindeer', 'Year', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Nestor', 'Long-Eared', 'Christmas', 'Donkey', 'Mad', 'Monster', 'Party', 'Little', 'Drummer', 'Boy', 'Frosty', 'Snowman', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Coming', 'Town', 'Mouse', 'Mayflower', 'Here', 'Peter', 'Cottontail', 'Cricket', 'Hearth', 'Stingiest', 'Man', 'Town', 'Jack', 'Frost', 'Pinnochio', 'Christmas', 'Rudolph', 'Shiny', 'New', 'Year', 'First', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'also', 'made', 'non-holiday', 'films', 'such', 'Hobbit', 'Flight', 'Dragons', 'Last', 'Unicorn', 'incredible', 'one', 'company', 'responsible', 'TV', 'specials', '95', '%', 'ones', 'see', 'year', 'work', 'standard', 'animation', 'stop-motion', 'animagic', 'live', 'action.I', 'hope', 'out', 'restored', 'DVD', 'soon', 'have', 'bought', 'other', 'Rankin/Bass', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD']",N/A
