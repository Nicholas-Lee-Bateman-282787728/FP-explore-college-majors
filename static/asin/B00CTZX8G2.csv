1650938,A3W3RX6IVRQNZG,B00CTZX8G2,Bureau,"[2, 2]","In horror films (and particularly lost tape films,) the antagonist, be it a witch, a demon, a ghost, or a nebulous phenomenon, is one of if not THE main character, replete with motivations and a (preferably rich) back-story.  This not only engages the audience in the story itself, but broadcasts the sorts of dangers we can expect the protagonists to face.  Blair Witch was a popular example of the lost tapes genre that spent nearly half an hour building up the lore of the titular character.Bake Street had numerous ways of doing the same thing in an efficient manner.  Piers, the mysterious character who offers the struggling couple $2 million to spend a week in a haunted house, would have been the perfect vehicle for this.  An interview with him (or his lawyer,) could have answered why he was willing to make such a ridiculous offer (was he performing an experiment?  Did he make a pact with the entity?  Was he perhaps part of the story of the haunting itself?)  As it was, he was the knife on the mantle that was never mentioned again; a vague, nebulous blob of unexplored potential and a waste of the audience' time.  An interview with a local historian or elderly neighbor could have also offered some exposition.  If they didn't want to go this route, they could have at least thrown some news clippings or family videos the couple's way.  Without offering any spoilers, all I got out of the back-story was that there was a family of moody people who liked to take pictures of each other, and a little girl who liked to dress up like she was going to prom, and then, at some point, one or more people died somehow.While there were a few other obscure clues I'm likely discounting (or, I will admit, may have gone over my head,) that's it.  This is all the back-story I came away with.  As a result, the haunting felt extremely generic, and the protagonists seemed to upstage it at pretty much every turn.So this is what it comes down to: was this film worth the $1.99 price of admission?  If you don't expect the budget or effects of The Ring, or the originality of Blair Witch, and are prepared to overlook the glaring issues above, it might be.  The stars (whom I am assuming are married IRL; they share the same last name,) have good chemistry, and appear to have inserted their own holiday/wedding footage to establish their characters, which honestly felt pretty natural.  The pacing was alright, and there are a few interesting scenes interspersed throughout the film, and the horror elements are not nearly as reliant on jump scares as one would expect given the genre.",3,"If you're not expecting much, you probably won't be disappointed.",1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,2590,"['horror', 'films', 'particularly', 'lost', 'tape', 'films', 'antagonist', 'be', 'witch', 'demon', 'ghost', 'nebulous', 'phenomenon', 'one', 'not', 'THE', 'main', 'character', 'replete', 'motivations', 'preferably', 'rich', 'back-story', 'not', 'only', 'audience', 'story', 'sorts', 'dangers', 'can', 'expect', 'protagonists', 'face', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'was', 'popular', 'example', 'lost', 'tapes', 'genre', 'spent', 'nearly', 'hour', 'building', 'up', 'lore', 'titular', 'character.Bake', 'Street', 'had', 'numerous', 'ways', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'efficient', 'manner', 'Piers', 'mysterious', 'character', 'who', 'struggling', 'couple', '2', 'million', 'spend', 'week', 'haunted', 'house', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'interview', 'lawyer', 'could', 'have', 'answered', 'why', 'was', 'willing', 'make', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'offer', 'was', 'performing', 'experiment', 'Did', 'make', 'pact', 'entity', 'Was', 'perhaps', 'part', 'story', 'haunting', 'was', 'was', 'knife', 'mantle', 'was', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'vague', 'nebulous', 'blob', 'unexplored', 'potential', 'waste', 'audience', 'time', 'interview', 'local', 'historian', 'elderly', 'neighbor', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'offered', 'exposition', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'route', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'thrown', 'news', 'clippings', 'family', 'couple', 'way', 'offering', 'spoilers', 'got', 'out', 'back-story', 'was', 'was', 'family', 'moody', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'take', 'pictures', 'other', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'liked', 'dress', 'up', 'was', 'going', 'prom', 'then', 'point', 'one', 'more', 'people', 'died', 'were', 'few', 'other', 'obscure', 'clues', ""'m"", 'likely', 'discounting', 'will', 'admit', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'head', 'back-story', 'came', 'away', 'result', 'haunting', 'felt', 'extremely', 'generic', 'protagonists', 'seemed', 'upstage', 'pretty', 'much', 'turn.So', 'what', 'down', 'was', 'film', '1.99', 'price', 'admission', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'budget', 'effects', 'Ring', 'originality', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'are', 'prepared', 'overlook', 'glaring', 'issues', 'might', 'be', 'stars', 'whom', 'am', 'assuming', 'are', 'married', 'IRL', 'share', 'same', 'last', 'name', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'appear', 'have', 'inserted', 'own', 'holiday/wedding', 'footage', 'establish', 'characters', 'honestly', 'felt', 'pretty', 'natural', 'pacing', 'was', 'alright', 'are', 'few', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'interspersed', 'film', 'horror', 'elements', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'reliant', 'jump', 'scares', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'given', 'genre']",The Bake Street Hauntings

A man we never see supposedly offered them this dare via a lawyer, whom again...we never see. The original transaction between the lawyer and the couple was done on video cam, but the cam is left in the house and I'm going to assume that film was either erased or never existed since we never see that footage. I agree with one reviewer as I did not get the feel of a couple in love, but that may be just poor acting. And who would accept the offer not knowing what this house is all about? So greed is what I get from our two &#34;buddies.&#34; Kind of like those people that try and try so many &#34;get rich quick&#34; schemes (scams)! Anyway, there are some very creepy parts and being a sucker for found footage movies, good and bad, and at the price....yeah, it's worth it.Possible spoiler.......My assumption is that, like the family before where old pictures were found, our mysterious rich man will now use all of the footage he got (via cams in every room) to make an offer to a new family/couple and our current couple will now replace the current haunters (the creepy family).

1650944,A391AS877NJKUB,B00CTZX8G2,"G. Smith ""Egghead""","[11, 12]","I felt I had to rent this and write a review, considering that at least one of the reviews already on here was written by a cast member.  I have seen just about every haunted house and found footage film available, and most of them are complete crap.  I'm happy to say that this one bucks the trend and is actually not horrible.  Still, I wouldn't say that it's good, but it seems to be an achievement to make an indie horror flick that's simply tolerable.The movie is very short - just 70 minutes - which makes it great as a short diversion.  However, it also leaves little room to develop characters or a plot.  As a result, both end up being wafer thin and easily forgettable.  Even the house, which used to be the main character in any haunted house story, as well as the ghosts themselves, have taken supporting roles in a movie that really stars a few good haunt scenes.  Thankfully, these scenes are the movie's real strong points, and I dare say that some of them were creepy.  I won't issue any spoilers, but suffice it to say that I think these moments are above average for the genre.There were two things that made this film difficult to watch.  The first is the movie itself.  Not only is it dark, it's shot in black and white, and I could hardly follow the passage of time.  This is inexplicable, since hand held recorders have been recording color in daylight for well over a decade.  To make matters even worse, the house is filled with security cams, to which the editor has applied digital filters to give them scan lines.  If you want to frustrate your viewers, occlude their view with scan lines, it works every time.  Secondly, there's music.  This makes the movie not so much ""found footage"" as ""found, carefully edited and scored footage"".  None of it adds to the mood of any scene, and it ends up being scan-lines for the ears.All in all, it's not a bad way to spend a few dollars and an hour of your life.  If you're a fan of indie horror, give it a chance.",3,Slightly above average indie horror,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,1982,"['felt', 'had', 'rent', 'write', 'review', 'considering', 'least', 'one', 'reviews', 'already', 'here', 'was', 'written', 'cast', 'member', 'have', 'seen', 'just', 'haunted', 'house', 'found', 'footage', 'film', 'available', 'most', 'are', 'complete', 'crap', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'one', 'trend', 'actually', 'not', 'horrible', 'Still', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'good', 'be', 'achievement', 'make', 'indie', 'horror', 'flick', 'simply', 'tolerable.The', 'movie', 'very', 'short', 'just', '70', 'minutes', 'great', 'short', 'diversion', 'However', 'also', 'little', 'room', 'develop', 'characters', 'plot', 'result', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'wafer', 'thin', 'easily', 'forgettable', 'Even', 'house', 'used', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'ghosts', 'have', 'taken', 'supporting', 'roles', 'movie', 'really', 'few', 'good', 'haunt', 'scenes', 'Thankfully', 'scenes', 'are', 'movie', 'real', 'strong', 'points', 'dare', 'say', 'were', 'creepy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'issue', 'spoilers', 'say', 'think', 'moments', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'genre.There', 'were', 'two', 'things', 'made', 'film', 'difficult', 'watch', 'first', 'movie', 'Not', 'only', 'dark', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'could', 'hardly', 'follow', 'passage', 'time', 'inexplicable', 'hand', 'held', 'recorders', 'have', 'been', 'recording', 'color', 'daylight', 'well', 'decade', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'worse', 'house', 'filled', 'security', 'cams', 'editor', 'applied', 'digital', 'filters', 'give', 'scan', 'lines', 'want', 'frustrate', 'viewers', 'occlude', 'view', 'scan', 'lines', 'time', 'Secondly', 'music', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'found', 'footage', 'found', 'carefully', 'edited', 'scored', 'footage', 'None', 'mood', 'scene', 'up', 'being', 'scan-lines', 'ears.All', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'spend', 'few', 'dollars', 'hour', 'life', ""'re"", 'fan', 'indie', 'horror', 'give', 'chance']",The Bake Street Hauntings
