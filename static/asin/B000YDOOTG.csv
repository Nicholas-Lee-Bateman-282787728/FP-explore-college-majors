Years only added to her voice and her command of it, musicianship is great, relationship between her, backing vocals and musicians is obviously warm, full of respect and understanding, arrangements ably utilize enormous potential engaged here, sound mixing and recording are superb, picture quality is good and the choice of the songs EXCELLENT! Everyone with the slightest interest in this great singer should have this revelation of a concert on DVD.

1119213,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000YDOOTG,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 6]","I have to admit it's taken me years to warm up to Olivia Newton-John as I originally wrote her off as the most pre-packaged of pop singers with her breathy voice and her Breck-girl prettiness. However, there is no denying her longevity in such an unforgiving business. When I saw the stage version ofXanaduon Broadway in December, it was as much a tribute to her as it was to the surreal travesty the movie is. It's been nearly four decades since her first stateside success, a twangy cover of Bob Dylan's ""If Not for You"", which she performs here as the lead-off to a sit-down medley of her country hits. Capturing her at the Sydney Opera House in March 2006, this concert DVD gives testament to her enduring career, and at a slightly cosmetically altered 57, her slightly throatier voice may have lost some of the higher notes but still maintains the pop sheen she's always had.Olivia's set is pretty extensive with 27 songs over the course of its 127-minute running time, long by most concert standards although there is filler in the form of random home-movie video clips of her trip to Sydney. Obviously, she has a wealth of musical material from which to cull, so it's a tribute to her that her repertoire is so varied. Most of the songs remain true to the original arrangements, although a few have been dramatically changed like the anachronistically samba-sized version of ""Physical"". The only times where Olivia falters is on the songs that require her early-years tremolo like the opener, ""Have You Never Been Mellow?"", where you can hear the strain. Otherwise, she is quite relaxed, perhaps too much so as her sometimes intimate delivery appears at odds with the cavernous opera house.As her fans would demand, Olivia and her back-up singers cover the soundtracks ofGreaseandXanadupretty thoroughly, and their good spirits are infectious even if the approach is a bit karaoke (especially with the feather boas). She is candid with her early 1990's bout with breast cancer on the upbeat ""Not Gonna Give In to It"" and even does a Natalie Cole-style duet with a video of the late Peter Allen on his poignant ballad, ""Tenterfield Saddler"". Her patter can come across as a bit canned. However, unlike Cher or Celine Dion, who fill their shows with extravagant costume changes, gymnastic dancers and smoky special effects, Olivia relies almost solely on her sincere delivery, which may make this concert a bit of a stretch for non-fans. There is a big-screen behind her to remind people of her career highlights, but it's shown rather incidentally. The 2008 DVD could have provided more extras, but it would be difficult to begrudge a pop princess who doesn't look ready to descend her throne.",4,"Olivia Still Asks If You've Ever Been Mellow, and the Answer Is Indeed Yes",1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,2699,"['have', 'admit', 'taken', 'years', 'warm', 'up', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'originally', 'wrote', 'off', 'most', 'pre-packaged', 'pop', 'singers', 'breathy', 'voice', 'Breck-girl', 'prettiness', 'However', 'denying', 'longevity', 'such', 'unforgiving', 'business', 'When', 'saw', 'stage', 'version', 'Broadway', 'December', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'tribute', 'was', 'surreal', 'movie', 'been', 'nearly', 'four', 'decades', 'first', 'stateside', 'success', 'twangy', 'cover', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Not', 'here', 'lead-off', 'sit-down', 'medley', 'country', 'hits', 'Capturing', 'Sydney', 'Opera', 'House', 'March', '2006', 'concert', 'DVD', 'testament', 'enduring', 'career', 'slightly', 'cosmetically', 'altered', '57', 'slightly', 'throatier', 'voice', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'higher', 'notes', 'still', 'pop', 'sheen', 'always', 'had.Olivia', 'set', 'pretty', 'extensive', '27', 'songs', 'course', '127-minute', 'running', 'time', 'long', 'most', 'concert', 'standards', 'filler', 'form', 'random', 'home-movie', 'video', 'clips', 'trip', 'Sydney', 'Obviously', 'wealth', 'musical', 'material', 'cull', 'tribute', 'repertoire', 'so', 'varied', 'Most', 'songs', 'remain', 'true', 'original', 'arrangements', 'few', 'have', 'been', 'dramatically', 'changed', 'anachronistically', 'samba-sized', 'version', 'Physical', 'only', 'times', 'where', 'Olivia', 'songs', 'require', 'early-years', 'tremolo', 'opener', 'Have', 'Never', 'Been', 'Mellow', 'where', 'can', 'hear', 'strain', 'Otherwise', 'quite', 'relaxed', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'sometimes', 'intimate', 'delivery', 'odds', 'cavernous', 'opera', 'house.As', 'fans', 'would', 'demand', 'Olivia', 'back-up', 'singers', 'cover', 'soundtracks', 'ofGreaseandXanadupretty', 'thoroughly', 'good', 'spirits', 'are', 'infectious', 'even', 'approach', 'bit', 'karaoke', 'especially', 'feather', 'boas', 'candid', 'early', '1990', 'bout', 'breast', 'cancer', 'upbeat', 'Not', 'Gon', 'Give', 'even', 'Natalie', 'Cole-style', 'duet', 'video', 'late', 'Peter', 'Allen', 'poignant', 'ballad', 'Tenterfield', 'Saddler', 'patter', 'can', 'come', 'bit', 'canned', 'However', 'Cher', 'Celine', 'Dion', 'who', 'fill', 'shows', 'extravagant', 'costume', 'changes', 'gymnastic', 'dancers', 'smoky', 'special', 'effects', 'Olivia', 'almost', 'solely', 'sincere', 'delivery', 'may', 'make', 'concert', 'bit', 'stretch', 'non-fans', 'big-screen', 'remind', 'people', 'career', 'highlights', 'shown', 'rather', 'incidentally', '2008', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'provided', 'more', 'extras', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'begrudge', 'pop', 'princess', 'who', ""n't"", 'look', 'ready', 'descend', 'throne']",N/A

I love that playful bantering back and forth and her high notes at the end are spectacular. I thought that was so catch,  I downloaded it on my Ipod. I had the orginal. Overall, the whole concert is wonderful. I enjoyed the Dancin' song from Xanadu. Not such a great movie, but great songs. Dancin' meshes 40s type tune with rock.  She did a lot of her hits like I Honestly Love You, Xanadu, Let Me Be There, If Not for You(Her first hit) If You Love Me, Let Me Know to a Grease Medley and Suddenly as a duet with her back-up singer. Olivia and her voice have held up very well. I enjoyed these when I was a lot younger in elementary school and high school.  I finally got to watch the video and I liked it so much I played it again. I also let people hear Physical over the phone.  You will be glad you bought it if you ever were a fan of hers. I wish the concert had been longer.

That said it seems that a number of singers who came of age in the 1970's are the ones who continue to deliver the goods live.Olivia is a real life survivor, and here she is backed by not only the Sydney Symphony, but her own tight band and real live back-up vocalists. Sometimes artists have the urge to delv into the world of cover songs, or sing a lot of new material, here Olivia stands by the age tested showbiz saying, give the people want they want.In a very polished, and classy way, she delivers the hits from all phases are her long career. Have You Ever Been Mellow, and a medley of her Country hits, such as Let Me Be There, do justice to her early years, and although the film of Xanadu was not a hit, the soundtrack was, and she shows us why.Physical, from the album of the same name, and her biggest seller todate, gets a revamp here, but the playfullnes of the song remains, as it does on Make A Move On Me.Grease is well represented here (as it should be), and these songs never seem to grow old, and I doubt they ever will.  A star in his own right, Warren Ham, fills in for John Travolta, and frankly sings better than Mr. Travolta ever could.Olivia closes the show with the beautiful ballad, I Honesty Love You, a song written by fellow Australian, the late, great, Peter Allen.

Even if Olivia's gold sequined pant-suit is questionable, she looks and sounds great.  Only a  few times were those high notes a bit of a stretch, but for someone her age, the vocals were more than satisfying and the show was absolutely professional.""Have You Never Been Mellow"" opens the act and proceeds with songs from `Xanadu' before Olivia does a series of her country-flavored songs, including her first big hit, ""If Not For You"".  A slow version of ""Psychical"" is extremely interesting and her own penned song, ""Not Gonna Give In To It"", a response from her battle with breast cancer.  Mixing slow ballads (""Cry Me A River"") with faster numbers (""Twist Of Fate""), the show completely entertains.  The symphony adds an enormous element of power to the show with several symphonic song introductions.""Tenterfield Saddler"", a song written by Peter Allen is sung with pure emotion, as is the other Allen song, ""I Honestly Love You"".  Of course, towards the end of the concert, Olivia plays with the audience and her band members by going through some of the bigger hits from ""Grease"" with a great rousing rendition of, ""You're The One That I Want"" and a fun, ""Summer Nights"".  Concluding with the song version of the `Serenity' prayer, Olivia Newton-John brings home the goods.The concert is a five-star, but this DVD I have to give less to.  More than often, DVD Concerts mix interviews' in between concert songs, interrupting the excitement or mood of the entire experience.  In between every song, we are witness to Olivia giving us a tour of Sydney, meeting fans and having fun, but this should have been a separate `extra' on the DVD.

I must say that seeing this is like having a religious experience.Im a Heavy Metal Guitarist that listens to a variety of musical styles and this DVD really reached me.I could tell from watching GREASE that OLIVIA was a trained singer, but what is more amazing is seeing her after so many years perform these songs in the exact same key flawlessly. Honestly Im speechless. It reminds me when I saw Pat Benatar in 2008, and sang everything in the same key as well.This DVD, for all of us that appreciate true talent is a must. Olivia covers her entire career of his early hits as a country singer, to the ground breaking songs from Grease and other songs inspired after her recovery from Cancer.One arrangement that really caught my attention is the superb arrangement of PHYSICAL in BOSSA NOVA style. It was absolutely amazing.The Sydney Symphonic Orchestra did an amazing job and so did her band. What did surprised me is that one of my favorite guitar players is her musical director which is something I didnt know - ANDY TIMMONS.Again - This concert is simply one of those nights where genious, magic and superb talent are together in one stage!!RATING 10NOTE - I highly recommend her albums GRACE AND GRATITUDE and STRONGER THAN BEFORE!RAY ST JOHN",5,A Religious Experience!!,1286582400,"10 9, 2010",2010,1329,"['was', 'compelled', 'buy', 'DVD', 'found', 'mere', 'accident', 'site', 'must', 'say', 'seeing', 'having', 'religious', 'experience.Im', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'Guitarist', 'variety', 'musical', 'styles', 'DVD', 'really', 'reached', 'me.I', 'could', 'tell', 'watching', 'GREASE', 'OLIVIA', 'was', 'trained', 'singer', 'what', 'more', 'amazing', 'seeing', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'perform', 'songs', 'exact', 'same', 'key', 'flawlessly', 'Honestly', 'Im', 'speechless', 'when', 'saw', 'Pat', 'Benatar', '2008', 'sang', 'everything', 'same', 'key', 'well.This', 'DVD', 'appreciate', 'true', 'talent', 'must', 'Olivia', 'entire', 'career', 'early', 'hits', 'country', 'singer', 'ground', 'breaking', 'songs', 'Grease', 'other', 'songs', 'inspired', 'recovery', 'Cancer.One', 'arrangement', 'really', 'caught', 'attention', 'superb', 'arrangement', 'PHYSICAL', 'BOSSA', 'NOVA', 'style', 'was', 'absolutely', 'amazing.The', 'Sydney', 'Symphonic', 'Orchestra', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'so', 'did', 'band', 'What', 'did', 'surprised', 'one', 'favorite', 'guitar', 'players', 'musical', 'director', 'something', 'didnt', 'know', 'ANDY', 'TIMMONS.Again', 'concert', 'simply', 'one', 'nights', 'where', 'genious', 'magic', 'superb', 'talent', 'are', 'together', 'one', 'stage', 'RATING', '10NOTE', 'highly', 'recommend', 'albums', 'GRACE', 'AND', 'GRATITUDE', 'STRONGER', 'THAN', 'RAY', 'ST', 'JOHN']",N/A
1119223,A131KVPK04H8CL,B000YDOOTG,R. Stopher,"[4, 12]",I just watched this & was a bit let down. First the tour of Australia in between songs should have been a seperate extra not padding for the dvd. I corrected Amazons running time or tried to this runs 127 minutes not 187 as first listed. She ran through some of her hits with just a few lines from the songs & ran through full length lesser known songs. Physical was turned into a slow lounge song for elevator music. The early Olivia in concert from the early 1980s was far superior. I thought Carly Simon on the Queen Mary did her songs with more life than Olivia did hers. Her one back up singer looks like a young clone of Laura Branigan. Thats the way i saw the concert for my review.,2,She has few concerts available on dvd to compare this with.,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,689,"['just', 'watched', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'First', 'tour', 'Australia', 'songs', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'seperate', 'extra', 'not', 'padding', 'dvd', 'corrected', 'Amazons', 'running', 'time', 'tried', '127', 'minutes', 'not', '187', 'first', 'listed', 'ran', 'hits', 'just', 'few', 'lines', 'songs', 'ran', 'full', 'length', 'lesser', 'known', 'songs', 'Physical', 'was', 'turned', 'slow', 'lounge', 'song', 'elevator', 'music', 'early', 'Olivia', 'concert', 'early', '1980s', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'thought', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'did', 'songs', 'more', 'life', 'Olivia', 'did', 'hers', 'one', 'back', 'up', 'singer', 'looks', 'young', 'clone', 'Laura', 'Branigan', 'way', 'i', 'saw', 'concert', 'review']",N/A
