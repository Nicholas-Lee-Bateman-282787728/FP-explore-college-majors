I&#8217;m not familiar with the politics of the time or with Japanese culture, and one really should expect from an American made film of the 50&#8217;s that it is going to be biased.  That being said, most of the humor that, on the outset may seem set to insult or belittle the Japanese people, really only makes Americans look ridiculous, and I&#8217;m not entirely unsure that that wasn&#8217;t the intention.But really, does any of it matter when the film is this boring?  I don&#8217;t think so.  For a film that is supposed to be some adaptation of a Broadway comedy, this film was a dry as dirt and offered really no humor whatsoever.  The film seemed desperately cluttered and labored by a running time it didn&#8217;t need, which caused so many of the scenes to drag on for far too long.  The first twenty minutes felt so long I swear I thought the movie should be ending.  Stage to screen adaptations can be tough, because the stage thrives on engrossing conversation and secluded space, but this dialog was so belabored and uninteresting that I found myself wanting to take a nap.Brando is nowhere near as offensive here as Mickey Rooney was in &#8216;Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s&#8217;, but this movie is also nowhere near as interesting as that one was.",2,Does it really matter?,1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,1416,"['will', 'balk', '8216', 'Teahouse', 'August', 'Moon', '8217', 'offensive', 'insulting', '8217', 'not', 'even', 'going', 'touch', 'much', '8217', 'not', 'familiar', 'politics', 'time', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'one', 'really', 'should', 'expect', 'American', 'made', 'film', '50', '8217', 'going', 'be', 'biased', 'being', 'said', 'most', 'humor', 'outset', 'may', 'seem', 'set', 'insult', 'belittle', 'Japanese', 'people', 'really', 'only', 'Americans', 'look', 'ridiculous', '8217', 'not', 'entirely', 'unsure', 'wasn', '8217', 'intention.But', 'really', 'matter', 'when', 'film', 'boring', 'don', '8217', 'think', 'so', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'adaptation', 'Broadway', 'comedy', 'film', 'was', 'dry', 'dirt', 'offered', 'really', 'humor', 'whatsoever', 'film', 'seemed', 'desperately', 'cluttered', 'labored', 'running', 'time', '8217', 'need', 'caused', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'drag', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'felt', 'so', 'long', 'swear', 'thought', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'ending', 'Stage', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'stage', 'engrossing', 'conversation', 'secluded', 'space', 'dialog', 'was', 'so', 'belabored', 'uninteresting', 'found', 'wanting', 'take', 'nap.Brando', 'nowhere', 'near', 'offensive', 'here', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'was', '8216', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', '8217', '8217', 'movie', 'also', 'nowhere', 'as', 'interesting', 'one', 'was']",N/A

However, that was not the case at all. In fact, he only had a very minimum presence, but that didn't mean the film was terrible. On the contrary, I enjoyed it only to a certain extent. Glenn Ford clearly stole the show as he portrayed himself an affable solider who showed a change of heart through seeing effects on his attitude after experiencing a culture change. The result was quite enjoyable and sensible fun. On the other hand, I found the film to be quite unconventional and sometimes awkward to watch. One distracting part about it is the sight of Marlon Brando's face as if he just came back from a major Botox treatment. It would make a lot more sense if he was eliminated from the film altogether and be substituted with a real Japanese actor. Nevertheless, Brando did a magnificent job disguising himself as a Japanese because I couldn't tell many times if it was him or not. Some parts of the film were slow and didn't add much to the overall story. That caused choppiness in the pacing of The Teahouse of the August Moon.

But we are also nice guys and intend to raise the Okinawa's in the American tradition. This starts with building a pentagon shaped schoolhouse. Captain Fisby (Glenn Ford) is sent to Okinawa because he is so good at everything he does that the command is willing to let someone else have him (anyone else). With the influence of the local natives including local native Sakini (Marlon Brando) Captain Fisby is persuaded that they need to build their economy first. And the first order of business is to take the school house supplies and build the ""Tea House of the August Moon.""The film is a 1954 adaptation of Vern J. Sneider's 1951 novel by Vern J. Snider and play by John Patrick. One of the filming locations is the Yamashiro Restaurant - 1999 N.

Personally I found it alternatingly absurd, offensive, and soporific.Supposedly much of it was filmed in Japan, yet many scenes look like a cheap sound stage. The script, written by a gay playwright, struggles to figure out how to develop and resolve an unconsummated love affair between a soldier and a geisha, and ultimately abandons this problem fecklessly as if it was never worth serious consideration in the first place. The two young male leads, on the other hand, go through such a bonding ritual, you almost expect them to start kissing (an impression heightened by one of them wearing a bath robe throughout much of the picture).No doubt this movie, and the Pulitzer-winning play that it was based on, were well intentioned as a parable against American oppression of primitive cultures, yet the script is incessantly condescending to the ""simple folk"" of Okinawa and is ultimately as simple-minded as the military machine that it mocks.The dramatic structure is virtually nonexistent. Even a low-grade TV sitcom would make better sense. It is utterly episodic, with characters who change arbitrarily to satisfy the predetermined outcome of the plot.Direction is heavy-handed, with much mugging and pausing for laughs. The extreme wide-screen format is totally unsuited to the action. The only high point for me was an unbroken sequence showing a formal geisha dance with fidelity and respect for the cultural source.Broadway has a long history of taking ""controversial"" themes and trivializing them in a comedic format which defuses the subject matter and enables audiences to go home feeling good about themselves and the world. And Hollywood in the 1950s and 1960s had a long history of picking up such vapid nonsense and trivializing it further for the presumably dumber audiences beyond the theater-going public of New York City, Long Island, and New Jersey. Happily this particular form of exploitation barely exists anymore, and Teahouse of the August Moon is now merely an embarrassing relic.Two stars, rather than one, because of the dance sequence, which is worth viewing.",2,Embarrassing in so many ways,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,2299,"['can', 'laugh', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'playing', 'kind', 'Japanese', 'Uncle', 'Tom', 'wearing', 'silly', 'grin', 'speaking', 'broken', 'English', 'American', 'military', 'masters', 'movie', 'Personally', 'found', 'alternatingly', 'offensive', 'soporific.Supposedly', 'much', 'was', 'filmed', 'Japan', 'yet', 'many', 'scenes', 'look', 'cheap', 'sound', 'stage', 'script', 'written', 'gay', 'playwright', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'develop', 'resolve', 'unconsummated', 'love', 'affair', 'soldier', 'geisha', 'ultimately', 'abandons', 'problem', 'fecklessly', 'was', 'never', 'worth', 'serious', 'consideration', 'first', 'place', 'two', 'young', 'male', 'other', 'hand', 'go', 'bonding', 'ritual', 'almost', 'expect', 'start', 'kissing', 'impression', 'heightened', 'one', 'wearing', 'bath', 'robe', 'much', 'picture', 'doubt', 'movie', 'Pulitzer-winning', 'play', 'was', 'based', 'were', 'well', 'intentioned', 'parable', 'American', 'oppression', 'primitive', 'cultures', 'yet', 'script', 'incessantly', 'condescending', 'simple', 'folk', 'Okinawa', 'ultimately', 'as', 'simple-minded', 'military', 'machine', 'dramatic', 'structure', 'virtually', 'nonexistent', 'Even', 'low-grade', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'would', 'make', 'better', 'sense', 'utterly', 'episodic', 'characters', 'who', 'change', 'arbitrarily', 'satisfy', 'predetermined', 'outcome', 'plot.Direction', 'heavy-handed', 'much', 'mugging', 'pausing', 'laughs', 'extreme', 'wide-screen', 'format', 'totally', 'unsuited', 'action', 'only', 'high', 'point', 'was', 'unbroken', 'sequence', 'showing', 'formal', 'geisha', 'dance', 'fidelity', 'respect', 'cultural', 'source.Broadway', 'long', 'history', 'taking', 'controversial', 'themes', 'trivializing', 'comedic', 'format', 'subject', 'matter', 'audiences', 'go', 'home', 'feeling', 'good', 'world', 'Hollywood', '1950s', '1960s', 'had', 'long', 'history', 'picking', 'up', 'such', 'vapid', 'nonsense', 'trivializing', 'further', 'presumably', 'dumber', 'audiences', 'theater-going', 'public', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Long', 'Island', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Happily', 'particular', 'form', 'exploitation', 'barely', 'anymore', 'Teahouse', 'August', 'Moon', 'now', 'merely', 'embarrassing', 'relic.Two', 'stars', 'rather', 'one', 'dance', 'sequence', 'worth', 'viewing']",N/A

288367,A8MVGWI5ZKNQ5,6301978633,Daisy Brambletoes,"[29, 31]","I first saw this film when I was 9 or 10, at a time when I was already a bit of a Japanophile, and vaguely aware of geisha because of a beautiful music box I got one Christmas that had a tiny dancing geisha inside, and so when Lotus Blossum (the wonderful Machiko Kyo, who has played opposite such greats as Toshiro Mifune) wore her lovely lavendar kimono with the purple parasol, and later danced in the Tobiki Teahouse, it was one of the most magical things I had ever seen, and began my lifelong fascination with geisha.This charming, often under-rated movie is set in post-war Okinawa, which looks in this film as if it was still lost in time (I half expect to see the blind swordsman, Zatoichi, comning down the road).  The main lesson being taught, I suppose, is that people like Col.Purdy see the world in a very narrow perspective and wanted to squeeze his little bit of conquered Japan into his own image.  He is a bureaucrat who doesn't understand the Army, doesn't understand Japan, and doesn't seem to understand anything that rocks his little boat.  And even though the hard work of Captain Fisby and the people of Tobiki in restoring their village is succeeding beyond anyone's wildest dreams, Purdy nearly destroys it to make it conform to his obtuse reality.The kudos of this film go to Glenn Ford, Eddie Albert, and Machiko Kyo for unforgetable characters, and Brando is likable as a Japanese gofer, even if he still looks and sounds like Brando beneath the makeup.  It is not one of his best roles, but it is still fun to watch.Minor quibbles:Why does Lotus Blossom wear her geta and zori indoors, and why does Brando slip several times and call her a ""Gee-sha girl"" unless he is catering to the name occupational troops ignorantly gave to hookers pretending to be geisha?  That doesn't make sense since he does his best to explain to Fisby what a geisha actually is.

Well, I guess that's an exaggeration, but I remember seeing it in a theater and that was a long, long time ago. You'll get to see Marlon Brando, Glen Ford, Eddie Albert and Henry Morgan Way back in their youth. Personally, I think Brando was miscast as a Japanese interpreter, but he did a good job at being miscast. The whole crew bumbled along in chaos and a total lack of communication, but somehow the bumbling made for an interesting and amusing story out of those post-WWII times.Well, according to the U. S. Government, what the village needed was a pentagon-shaped school, but what they got was a teahouse. Somehow, I think the teahouse was the better thing in those tragic post-war times, but it would be a bit hard to justify up through congress especially with the added geisha lessons.. The story was well filmed and well translated from a play to a movie. The acting was good. Personally, I thought that Glen Ford was the best of the major actors. If I had to give any awards, it would be to those who portrayed the Japanese people. It was a good enjoyable comedy, but I didn't think as highly of it as the majority of reviewers.Gary Peterson",4,A Good Enjoyable Comedy.

I've never been a fan of Brando but he is excellent in this movie. If you have ever doubted his acting ability then you need to see this in which he portrays an Okinawan(!) &, yes, his makeup includes the slanting of the eyes. Glenn Ford is also excellent in a comedic role which he proved to be very adept at & would do many more times following this movie.The movie takes place in Okinawa immediately following the end of WWII. The American occupation force is there to assist the Okinawans in their rebuilding effort; & this is where the conflict of cultures comes in, the Okinawans have their own ideas in contrast with what the Americans have in mind. Brando shines as the scheming Sakini, a hustler without peer. Glenn Ford is the harried local commanding officer who's a misfit not in line with his superior officers. The movie also has two excellent co-stars: Paul Ford & Eddie Albert. Paul Ford reprises his role from the Broadway play of the same name.The DVD does have bonus features that includes the featurette ""Operation Teahouse"" & a Marlon Brando Trailer gallery. The Buyer should know this DVD version comes from a Marlon Brando set that has been broken up for individual sale. I'm ambivalent about that but the sellers are now charging way too much for this.

I probably had it confused with ""Sayonara"", Marlon Brando's other post WWII Japan film. And there was never any reason to suspect that it was anything but a light comedy, as it was based on a stage play.But it turns out that rather than just a comedy, it is more like a subtly subversive satire on America's staggering conceit as a righteous force of change in the world. How they managed to convince the studio and the public that it was just a harmless little comedy would make a great story itself, considering that it was made during the blacklist days of red-baiting and mega paranoia. My guess is that its patronizing portrayal of Japanese culture, and its characterization of the Okinawans as simple childlike islanders provided sufficient misdirection to throw our guardians off the scent. Hollywood was pretty good at slipping stuff like this into the mainstream, where the actual nature of the satire was only apparent to the most discerning viewers.As others have noted, the film's message is actually more relevant today than at the time of its release; what with America's botched meddling in Viet Nam, Lebanon, Somalia, and Iraq. As ""The Teahouse of the August Moon"" illustrates, there seems to be a national compulsion to change the world and a chronic failure to realistically evaluate the complexities of these little adventures.On the flip side, many of those who attack the film as racist are also critical of ""Eurotrip"" for its stereotyped portrayal of Europe; failing to recognize that the target of both films is America and its simplistic view of the rest of the world.Anyway, ""Teahouse"" takes place shortly after the end of WWII as Captain Fisby, a Army Civil Affairs officer (Glenn Ford), is detailed to an Okinawan village to teach the natives about ""democracy"". His most important task is to construct a ""pentagon"" shaped school for the children. But with the arrival of a Geisha named Lotus Blossom (Machiko Kyo) the villagers decide that a teahouse (basically a copy of the Geisha houses they have heard about in the cities) should be built instead. When it appears that Fisby has become too acclimated to the native culture, his commanding officer sends a psychiatrist (Eddie Albert) to the village to evaluate his fitness for duty. Albert is soon co-opted and stays on in the village indulging his fantasy of running a farm.Marlon Brando plays a native interpreter and carries it off quite nicely, in fact the whole cast is solid with Kyo unexpectedly effective and very charming. Speaking only Japanese (and without subtitles), her performance is similar to some of the best silent film stuff. Although Brando translates her more important lines for Fisby (and for the audience) her nonverbal performance communicates so much that you are rarely even aware of the language gap. Brando does a nice commentary to begin and end the film.While ""Teahouse"" is hardly Oscar material it is entertaining and of considerable historical/ cultural interest.Then again, what do I know?

In Japan the Geisha were sort of like minor movie stars and were even more rare in the farming backwater of Okinawa.An enterprise in which the local home brew becomes a thriving industry to supply the American occupation's thirst is classically misunderstood by the command's ideas of the democratic plan for the conquered.They were just lucky there was no Islamic terrorists on the side?A fun time is had by all and everybody ends happy.,4,A classic comedy of misdirection,1235088000,"02 20, 2009",2009,767,"['kind', 'humor', 'much', 'English', 'comedies', 'where', 'butleractually', 'things', 'here', 'Marlon', 'Brandon', 'very', 'clever', 'Japanese', 'interpretor', 'who', 'American', 'employers', 'look', 'classically', 'dumb.In', 'movie', 'also', 'confusion', 'postwar', 'American', 'minds', 'Japanese', 'Geishaentertainers', 'prostitutes', 'Japan', 'Geisha', 'were', 'sort', 'minor', 'movie', 'stars', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'rare', 'farming', 'backwater', 'Okinawa.An', 'enterprise', 'local', 'home', 'brew', 'thriving', 'industry', 'supply', 'American', 'occupation', 'thirst', 'classically', 'misunderstood', 'command', 'ideas', 'democratic', 'plan', 'conquered.They', 'were', 'just', 'lucky', 'was', 'Islamic', 'terrorists', 'side', 'fun', 'time', 'had', 'everybody', 'happy']",N/A

Glenn Ford was in the Army stationed in Japan and was sent to another town to build a school but ended up building a Tea House. I didn't remember what was going to happen because it was so many years since I had seen the movie.

It is just as good, if not better, than I remembered it.  How great it is to see a movie that was so successful at the time, with no profanity or sexual innuendo, great actors, and a gentle message that no matter how good intentions are, they can be wrong.  How I wish movies this great would be made today, instead of trying to push immoral, indecent, crude, standards down our throat today.  As one who lived through the time in the movie, it was difficult for many, but movies like this gently brought truth through humor to us, not vicious violence and hate.  I will watch it again, and again to be taken back to a kinder, gentler, and real time...and yes, I had many Japanese friends at that time who understood more than is given credit...and my father worked with them.",5,Just as good the second time around!!!,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,900,"['saw', 'movie', 'young', 'adult', 'when', 'originally', 'came', 'out', '1956', 'almost', '60', 'years', 'ago', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'then', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'remembered', 'How', 'great', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'time', 'profanity', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'great', 'actors', 'gentle', 'message', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'intentions', 'are', 'can', 'be', 'wrong', 'How', 'wish', 'movies', 'great', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'today', 'instead', 'trying', 'push', 'immoral', 'indecent', 'crude', 'standards', 'down', 'throat', 'today', 'one', 'who', 'lived', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'difficult', 'many', 'movies', 'gently', 'brought', 'truth', 'humor', 'not', 'vicious', 'violence', 'hate', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'kinder', 'gentler', 'real', 'time', 'yes', 'had', 'many', 'Japanese', 'friends', 'time', 'who', 'understood', 'more', 'given', 'credit', 'father', 'worked']",N/A
