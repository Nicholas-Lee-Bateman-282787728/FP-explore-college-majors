1600605,A2582KMXLK2P06,B009NRQTA6,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","Those who've submitted negative reviews here on amazon for the Apparition are NOT exaggerating- this movie is a disaster.  As someone who loves being frightened by ghosts and hauntings, the storyline sure had a ton of promise, and that's exactly why I bothered watching it in the first place.  I eagerly anticipated this one last night.An apparition haunts the lives of a man and his girlfriend who move into a suburban desert home.  The girlfriend (played by Ashley Greene) initially has NO idea that her boyfriend released an apparition into reality, so for a while she questions what's going on when odd events occur in the home, and initially chalks them up to being unexplainable coincidences (such as a small cactus plant suddenly dying upon bringing it home from the store).Clearly, this movie is intended for those who have a major crush on Ashley Greene (admittedly, I do as well) because the movie is all about focusing on Ashley's noticeable lack of clothing and overall hot and revealing body and facial appearance.  At just under 75 minutes (not including the credits) the storyline never even gets off the ground either.The actual apparition segments are *incredibly* disappointing.  Drawers and garage doors open by themselves, the dog suddenly becomes sick without explanation, and several other things you've seen a bunch of times in other horror films.  This movie uses one specific trick and uses it almost every single time a scare occurs- whenever Ashley or her boyfriend turns around, something happens *then*.  For example, in one scene when Ashley closes her bedroom drawer, the camera shows Ashley face the other way, and when she turns back the drawer is now open.  This same trick is used time and time again.  It stops being effective after a while.Even worse, there's almost *zero* devotion to building a horror atmosphere or creative storyline.  The apparition just does things instantaneously, and it's supposed to be enough to create fear for the viewers.  However the movie writers forgot to take notes and watch the original Amityville Horror to see how atmosphere and storyline build-up is *really* supposed to be done.I like a couple scenes.  The one with the couple finally realizing that an apparition has entered their home, so they spend the night in a hotel room is probably the very best one.  What almost made me think was an example of sleep paralysis, the man wakes up and sees his girlfriend being overwhelmed and strangled by a bed sheet, so he jumps up and rips it off.  Good segment here.  Also the one where Ashley's trapped (nailed shut) in a room and sees a black-haired female apparition coming out of the wall from behind and ominously crawls closer while Ashley desperately tries to remove the nails and escape in time had me somewhat terrified.The ending though... it's awful.  I won't spoil what happens, but I will say this- it's not enough.  It's a cop out, basically.  You can interpret it a couple different ways if you really wanted to analyze it, but I can't stop interpreting it the obvious way it appears.  I strongly recommend skipping this one.  The poor, almost rushed way Ashley frequently delivers her lines is another indication that not much thought went into this one.  Skip it.",2,uncreative and rushed ideas- one after another,1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,3251,"['who', ""'ve"", 'submitted', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'amazon', 'Apparition', 'are', 'NOT', 'exaggerating-', 'movie', 'disaster', 'someone', 'who', 'being', 'frightened', 'ghosts', 'hauntings', 'storyline', 'sure', 'had', 'ton', 'promise', 'exactly', 'why', 'bothered', 'watching', 'first', 'place', 'eagerly', 'anticipated', 'one', 'last', 'night.An', 'apparition', 'lives', 'man', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'move', 'suburban', 'desert', 'home', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'initially', 'NO', 'idea', 'boyfriend', 'released', 'apparition', 'reality', 'so', 'while', 'questions', 'what', 'going', 'when', 'odd', 'events', 'occur', 'home', 'initially', 'chalks', 'up', 'being', 'unexplainable', 'coincidences', 'such', 'small', 'cactus', 'plant', 'suddenly', 'dying', 'bringing', 'home', 'store', '.Clearly', 'movie', 'intended', 'who', 'have', 'major', 'crush', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'admittedly', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'focusing', 'Ashley', 'noticeable', 'lack', 'clothing', 'overall', 'hot', 'revealing', 'body', 'facial', 'appearance', 'just', '75', 'minutes', 'not', 'including', 'credits', 'storyline', 'never', 'even', 'ground', 'actual', 'apparition', 'segments', 'are', '*incredibly*', 'disappointing', 'Drawers', 'garage', 'doors', 'open', 'dog', 'suddenly', 'sick', 'explanation', 'several', 'other', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bunch', 'times', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'movie', 'one', 'specific', 'trick', 'almost', 'single', 'time', 'scare', 'occurs-', 'whenever', 'Ashley', 'boyfriend', 'around', 'something', 'happens', '*then*', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'Ashley', 'bedroom', 'drawer', 'camera', 'Ashley', 'face', 'other', 'way', 'when', 'back', 'drawer', 'now', 'open', 'same', 'trick', 'used', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'being', 'effective', 'while.Even', 'worse', 'almost', '*zero*', 'devotion', 'building', 'horror', 'atmosphere', 'creative', 'storyline', 'apparition', 'just', 'things', 'instantaneously', 'supposed', 'be', 'enough', 'create', 'fear', 'viewers', 'However', 'movie', 'writers', 'forgot', 'take', 'notes', 'watch', 'original', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'see', 'how', 'atmosphere', 'storyline', 'build-up', '*really*', 'supposed', 'be', 'done.I', 'couple', 'scenes', 'one', 'couple', 'finally', 'realizing', 'apparition', 'entered', 'home', 'spend', 'night', 'hotel', 'room', 'probably', 'very', 'best', 'one', 'What', 'almost', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'example', 'sleep', 'paralysis', 'man', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'being', 'overwhelmed', 'strangled', 'bed', 'sheet', 'up', 'rips', 'off', 'Good', 'segment', 'here', 'Also', 'one', 'where', 'Ashley', 'trapped', 'nailed', 'shut', 'room', 'black-haired', 'female', 'apparition', 'coming', 'wall', 'ominously', 'closer', 'Ashley', 'desperately', 'remove', 'nails', 'escape', 'time', 'had', 'somewhat', 'terrified.The', 'ending', 'awful', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'what', 'will', 'say', 'this-', 'not', 'enough', 'cop', 'out', 'basically', 'can', 'interpret', 'couple', 'different', 'ways', 'really', 'wanted', 'analyze', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'interpreting', 'obvious', 'way', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'skipping', 'one', 'poor', 'almost', 'rushed', 'way', 'Ashley', 'frequently', 'lines', 'indication', 'not', 'much', 'thought', 'went', 'one', 'Skip']",N/A

He's a hotty with a HUGE amount of talent.  Thus, the moment i saw his name credited to this movie, i decided to watch it.  Well, after setting my eyes upon this Visual Flatulence of Film, i feel as though i have been personally violated by ""said"" Actor.Here's an example of how poorly written this film is.Sebastian Stan (yes, that's him!) goes to a Mexican restaurant with his girlfriend Ashley Greene. Firstly, these two should have been cast as brother and sister.  There is absolutely NO CHEMISTRY between them.  She might as well have hooked up with the Harry Potter co-star in this movie and would have gotten the same effect.He has a job that apparently isn't working out for him.  She works at a Vet Clinic or possibly dog grooming - doesn't matter. He begins to tell her that he doesn't think he's cut out for the job.  Now, if my boyfriend would look at me and tell me that?  I'd listen, and start charting out options, put our heads together, etc.  What does this chick say? ""Oh, you had a bad day at work? GET OVER IT"" .. then commences to throwing tortilla chips at him to ""cheer him up"".. SERIOUSLY??Sorry folks, if that were me? Home girl would be wearing the menudo - with chips, and given the check.Other than that, it's obvious how Ashley got the lead role.  (Yep, walking around half naked in lingerie).The true spark of the movie was actually THE DOG.  Yes, people, THE DOG.  He played his role with amazing accuracy, and heart-felt emotion.  His 15 seconds of fame commenced when he walked into Sebastian Stan's (yes, that's him!) home and...died...that's right folks the dog just walks into their house lies down and gives up the ghost.  Far better than any of the actors would performed this magnificent and tragic feat... Which is probably why this part was given to the dog. (Kudos!)The rest of the movie is pretty much material ripped off from Ghost Hunters, Paranormal Witness, Ghost Chasers, Beer with Chasers, etc.,Don't believe me?  Here's an example:  The couple hears a noise, ""Did you hear that?"" they both look to the right, the camera pans to the right - nothing.One of the crew members throws a pebble to the left.  ""Did you hear that?""  couple looks left, camera pans left - nothing. (Crew member retrieves pebble before camera pans left)..and let's not forget to mention the knotted clothes in the closet - and the mold. (Top notch special effects, as one possibly ""sheltered-life"" reviewer stated.) Seriously?And apparently, the team of producers/directors/writers (if there were any) didn't give a rip about the movie. Why?  The poster is END of the movie.  No spoiler alert needed here, folks.  No wonder it was shelved for 2 years.. I'd shelve this piece of crap for longer than that.oh, and Shame on you Sebastian Stan!  You could have made more money doing a Play Girl Spread.

1600621,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B009NRQTA6,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[26, 37]","I'm always interested in a good ghost story which takes a unique look at the subject of the supernatural. Although I wouldn't necessarily call ""The Apparition"" completely original, it's an interesting enough blend of different ideas that makes it engrossing. There's a little Asian horror ala ""The Grudge"" and ""Pulse,"" a very small pinch (thankfully) of ""Paranormal Activity,"" and a bit of ""Poltergeist"" to top it off.The movie is stemmed in the idea that not only are there ghosts of actual dead people who haunt the living, but also evil entities that feed off people's beliefs. The more someone believes in a supernatural force, the stronger it gets. If it gets a foothold into someone, it can gain a greater entry into our physical world.The students in ""The Apparition"" use scientific equipment to amplify their beliefs by 400 times. This unleashes a hellish force into our realm that wants to stay here permanently. One of the students (Sebastian Stan) chooses to leave his research behind and move on with his life. He soon finds this to be more difficult than he imagined when the entity starts wreaking havoc on his girlfriend (Ashley Greene) and new house.I wholeheartedly agree with the idea of spirits being attached to people and not places. That's one thing that really fascinated me about this movie. It's not the typical film where a presence is affixed to the house and the tenants have to get away. These people try to escape by leaving the house and find the entity follows them no matter where they go.One concept in the film I had a problem with is if you believe in the spirits they become stronger. Demons or evil entities have power whether we admit their existence or not. Kevin Spacey said it best in ""The Usual Suspects:"" ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing everyone he doesn't exist.""The cast of ""The Apparition"" is an interesting mix of different talents. Ashley Green (""The Twilight Saga"") takes on the role of Girlfriend Kelly. Sebastian Stan (Bucky in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") plays her boyfriend, Ben, with a sinister past. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy in the ""Harry Potter"" movies) portrays the scientist trying to find a way to capture the spirit and keep it from entering the human world.The audio and video quality of the Blu-ray release looks wonderful. The picture is clean and, although most of the movie is dark, it's visually easy on the eyes. The 5.1 surround sound mix helps all the creepy bangs and bumps in the night to be well-distributed throughout a home theater setting.The extra features have very little to do with the actual movie. They're mostly made up of featurettes in which real life ghost hunter Joshua P. Warren investigates a couple of haunted spots and then tries to re-create the experiment that goes wrong in the film. ""'The Apparition:' A Cinematic Specter"" is a short behind-the-scenes look at what the cast thought about the experiment that serves as the catalyst for the entire film.""The Apparition"" on Blu-ray isn't the greatest supernatural thriller you'll ever see. However, it gets extra points for blending together some different takes on the haunted house genre we haven't seen mashed together yet. It will definitely keep some viewers on edge if you hear strange noises in your house when you go to bed.",4,"Blu-ray Review: ""The Apparition""",1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,3309,"[""'m"", 'always', 'interested', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'unique', 'look', 'subject', 'supernatural', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'call', 'Apparition', 'completely', 'original', 'interesting', 'enough', 'blend', 'different', 'ideas', 'engrossing', 'little', 'Asian', 'horror', 'Grudge', 'Pulse', 'very', 'small', 'pinch', 'thankfully', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'bit', 'Poltergeist', 'top', 'off.The', 'movie', 'stemmed', 'idea', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'there', 'ghosts', 'actual', 'dead', 'people', 'who', 'haunt', 'living', 'also', 'evil', 'entities', 'feed', 'off', 'people', 'beliefs', 'more', 'someone', 'supernatural', 'force', 'stronger', 'foothold', 'someone', 'can', 'gain', 'greater', 'entry', 'physical', 'world.The', 'students', 'Apparition', 'use', 'scientific', 'equipment', 'amplify', 'beliefs', '400', 'times', 'hellish', 'force', 'realm', 'stay', 'here', 'permanently', 'One', 'students', 'Sebastian', 'Stan', 'leave', 'research', 'behind', 'move', 'life', 'soon', 'be', 'more', 'difficult', 'imagined', 'when', 'entity', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'girlfriend', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'new', 'house.I', 'wholeheartedly', 'agree', 'idea', 'spirits', 'being', 'attached', 'people', 'not', 'places', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'fascinated', 'movie', 'not', 'typical', 'film', 'where', 'presence', 'affixed', 'house', 'tenants', 'have', 'get', 'away', 'people', 'try', 'escape', 'leaving', 'house', 'find', 'entity', 'matter', 'where', 'go.One', 'concept', 'film', 'had', 'problem', 'believe', 'spirits', 'become', 'stronger', 'Demons', 'evil', 'entities', 'have', 'power', 'admit', 'existence', 'not', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'said', 'best', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'greatest', 'trick', 'Devil', 'ever', 'pulled', 'was', 'convincing', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'exist', 'cast', 'Apparition', 'interesting', 'mix', 'different', 'talents', 'Ashley', 'Green', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'role', 'Girlfriend', 'Kelly', 'Sebastian', 'Stan', 'Bucky', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'boyfriend', 'Ben', 'sinister', 'past', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'scientist', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'capture', 'spirit', 'keep', 'entering', 'human', 'world.The', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'wonderful', 'picture', 'clean', 'most', 'movie', 'dark', 'visually', 'easy', 'eyes', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'mix', 'creepy', 'bangs', 'bumps', 'night', 'be', 'well-distributed', 'home', 'theater', 'setting.The', 'extra', 'features', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'actual', 'movie', ""'re"", 'mostly', 'made', 'featurettes', 'real', 'life', 'ghost', 'hunter', 'Joshua', 'P.', 'Warren', 'couple', 'haunted', 'spots', 'then', 'tries', 're-create', 'experiment', 'wrong', 'film', ""'The"", 'Apparition', 'A', 'Cinematic', 'Specter', 'short', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'what', 'cast', 'thought', 'experiment', 'catalyst', 'entire', 'film', 'Apparition', 'Blu-ray', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'supernatural', 'thriller', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'However', 'extra', 'points', 'blending', 'together', 'different', 'haunted', 'house', 'genre', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'mashed', 'together', 'yet', 'will', 'definitely', 'keep', 'viewers', 'edge', 'hear', 'strange', 'noises', 'house', 'when', 'go', 'bed']",N/A

After a not-very-dramatic seance scene, the next 30 minutes shows the most boring couple in California exhibit their zero chemistry to the audience. They go shopping at Costco, they buy a cactus, they install CCTV at home, they eat together, they drive around together and - just to cap it off - they live in a new subdivision in a new suburb of wherever. Pretty much every scene in the first act is completely unnecessary.If you're still awake when we get into act 2, not much happens here either. It steals ideas from The Grudge, Dark Water and many other better films. There's the token British guy who provides the exposition that ""bad things are going to happen"", a dead girl climbs out of the dryer and lights flicker on and off. The final act is even less interesting than the previous two and somehow ends up back in a Costco.Before anyone accuses me of giving away spoilers, the trailer for this film gives away the supposed twist at the ending, the cover shows the shot from the final scene, and the tagline (""Once you believe, you die"") is never explained in any way whatsoever. The trailer concept clearly shows that a group of researchers bring a ghost into existence through sheer belief and this is never explored at all through the movie.In terms of production values, there aren't any. The lighting is poor, the soundtrack doesn't match the action and the dialog is bordering on student improv. I remember reading screenplays at school with scenes where people make coffee or walk to dog just to fill pages and nearly two thirds of this movie consists of this filler material - and it's only an 82 minute film! None of the characters have any motivation whatsoever, the ghost isn't explained and ultimately it's a few shots they wanted to copy from other horror films mixed in with 80 minutes of junk.I haven't seen a movie this bad in years.

Lydia has made a small 3-D statue of Charles she made in engineering. Patrick believes this experiment is going to work.  As they concentrate, something happens. It was a thud from under the table. Then the table moves wildly. Then another thud. They hear creaking in the ventilation ducts. Then a crash. Greg and Lydia are scared. Lydia is breathing heavily. A camera knocks over. More creaking and banging. What is it? You will have to see the movie to find out.Kelly (Ashley Greene) and Ben (Sebastian Stan) are a couple.

1600636,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B009NRQTA6,John's Horror Corner,"[2, 3]","This unfortunate attempt to combine elements of the Poltergeist (1982, 1986, 1988), Pulse (2001, 2006, 2008), and Paranormal Activity (2007, 2010, 2011, 2012) franchises fails on all accounts leaving only mediocrity in its wake.  No good scares, tired effects and an unengaging story leave me with but one suggestion for you:  SKIP IT.The Gist--The concept is interesting enough.  Some young attractive folks test a theory that ghosts only exist because we believe in them.  Ergo, to believe in a ghost can facilitate the manifestation of one.  It works, ""it"" is pissed, and it haunt-hunts them down one by one.  The imagery and F/X strategy feel just like Pulse (but with Grudge-y dirty ghost hands).  Like I said, the ""concept"" is interesting--if only watching it unfold in this movie was, too.The movie begins when Patrick (Tom Felton; Rise of the Planet of the Apes), Ben (Sebastian Stan; Political Animals) and Lydia (Julianna Guill; Friday the 13th) re-enact a famous s&eacute;ance called The Charles Experiment in hopes of manifesting a ghost.  They succeed and we are deprived of enjoying any more screentime of Julianna Guill as she is Pulse-sucked into/through a wall.With no explanation of what happened in the ensuing years, life goes on and Ben is now living with his new girlfriend Kelly (Ashley Greene; the Twilight saga) in a quiet housing development just like the one in Poltergeist.  However, when strange things start happening in their home, he realizes that the ghost he had summoned years ago has found him.  Not wanting her to ""believe"" in the apparition, he passes off weird happenings on kids playing pranks and faulty electrical connections.  When things get a little too scary for comfort, he reunites with Patrick to help combat the ghost.The actors all do fine--nothing stellar, but actually good for a horror release.  Greene is credibly rattled, Stan does fine, and it was nice seeing Felton play a non-douchebag.  However, the paranormal effects were random, uninteresting, unimpressive, and even felt gratuitous.  Doors open, a dresser shifts six inches, furniture is rearranged and lights go out--never in an effective manner that may make you jump or feel tense or uneasy.  Then there was the Pulse-y haunted slime mold...So, they start finding slime mold deposits around the house.  It's gross and looks like a honey-combed, rotten, zombie, yellowjacket nest.  Evidently this is symptomatic of an evil presence.  While it's gross, it serves no real purpose in the movie other than devaluing Ben and Kelly's house and demonstrating that the filmmakers really didn't know how to handle this movie.  Or the ghost itself, in fact, as it is depicted in multiple forms so different I'd struggle to agree that it was only one ghost with one motive and one supernatural skill set.Biggest Horror Faux Pas:  The most nerve-wracking scene in the movie--which really wasn't that effective, just the most effective--involved a supernatural smothering bedspread assault on Kelly.  Such a tactic was employed in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and it was very effective even with limited effects.  However, in The Apparition, I was troubled for different reasons.  You see, evidently Kelly was using rubber sheets to solve a bedwetting problem because this bedspread was somehow suffocating her.  Later in the movie, the ghost just uses some powerful telekinesis to suck someone to their doom in the laundry room.  Why didn't it just use that power?  In fact, why was it playing with light switches and feng shui for the last hour of running time?  They explain the ghost's motives in the movie and they don't explain this behavior.Second Biggest Horror Faux Pas:  The greatest idiocy of the movie was in how ""the team"" tries to eradicate the ghost in end.  They go with the old ""satanic metal band album played backwards"" routine.  You know.  Just play the EEG recording signal (produced when they manifested the ghost) in reverse and it should send the thing back to Hell, right?  That makes sense, right?  Maaaaybe not.  I think the writer was thinking of summoning some evil thing by playing a death metal album in reverse--like in one of my old favorites: The Gate (1987).  But never does playing the album ""forward"" send the demon back to Hell.Basically, everything about this movie is stupid and inconsistent.  Don't see it unless you simply have a hankering for seeing Ashley Greene in her underwear.WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD:  Poltergeist (1982, 1986), Pulse (2001) and the Paranormal Activity (2007, 2010, 2011,

1600637,A146W4L7BDSL8V,B009NRQTA6,J. Pizzuto,"[0, 2]","This is a problematic movie.  To begin with, the blurb about the plot on the back of my DVD case is misleading.  It begins, ""Theorizing that the paranormal exists as a result of human belief, a group of students attempts to create a supernatural entity.""  This is patently false; whoever wrote that must have been spared the chore of actually having to watch this, since nowhere in this movie does anyone attempt to ""create"" anything--the students are merely channeling the entity that is the subject of the haunting.In terms of visual appeal, this movie is standard fare.  Acting-wise it falls short.  But the plot?  Blechhh.  Read on.It begins with a group of students trying to channel the spirit of a dead man after the pattern of a 1970s experiment that attempted the same.  This time, though, they're using fancy science gizmos!  So, naturally, it's all very scholarly and respectable.  The explanations given by the lead scientist about his research and equipment are (intentionally?) outlandish and nonsensical throughout, but the gist is that his machines amplify human brainwaves for a procedure that resembles a seance.  Of the three students involved, only one--the guy with the accent and the glasses--even pretends to know what's going on.  Apart from summoning a powerful entity that consumes one of them, what can go wrong?We cut to some time later, as Ben, one of the surviving two students, builds a new life with some bimbo, who he shacks up with in a cookie-cutter subdivision in the middle of nowhere.  Their brand new residence is her parents' otherwise vacant ""investment property.""  (Apparently her parents don't have any qualms about financing what is clearly a sex pad for their daughter and her boyfriend.)  It doesn't take long before spookiness ensues.  Ben, who obviously has knowledge of what's happening, is reluctant to confide in his girlfriend.  This begs the question:  What's the twist?  Is she somehow the entity given physical form, and she doesn't know what she is?  (No.)  Is he possessed by the entity?  (No.)  Do the nearby electrical towers play into the phenomena at all?  (No.)  The twist is, there is no twist.  The plot is linear and obvious.Eventually Ben clues his girlfriend in and they find Patrick, the geeky student with all the answers.  He tells them what we all already know--the problem isn't the house, it's the entity that they've unleashed.  So what's his solution?  That they all go back to the house for the Great Big Showdown, and watch as the resulting paranormal activity literally breaks the investment home to pieces!  Once they're satisfied that they've defeated the entity with some iffy science, Patrick offhandedly passes Ben's girlfriend a piece of paper.

Two stars (to me) means it was bad and not even laughable.  This movie was okay.  It did not have a lot of thrills or scares, but it did have one kind of neat scene involving a door being nailed shut and the result of the finished product.  I did not care for the ending and I'm not  really sure how we got to that ending, but whatever.  The acting was not horrible and it was able to keep my interest for the 82 minutes or so of its run.  Another reviewer wrote that the lead actress (Ashley Greene) spent most of the movie in a bikini or skimpy underwear. I must have purchased a different version. There was one scene (about 3 minutes long) where she walked around in a black nightie that was not particularly revealing and I kept thinking. &#34;If you're going outside, put some clothes on&#34;.  Anyway, my point is that some of the one star ratings here just don't deal with the movie accurately.  Another one star rating listed the pros and cons of the movie.  I can't remember what was written but it struck me as very inaccurate as to what really happened in the movie. Some other reviewer mentioned the cover. All I can say is..If you watch the movie then look at the cover, you'll see that there is a glaring error. About the ending. When I saw the ending coming, I thought about the great possibilities we had here and from the start of the final scene, I thought the crew of this film was really on to something. They let me down, copping out for a standard &#34;we couldn't come up with an original idea&#34; ending.  Major disappointment.

Right off the bat, the film can't decide if it's a POV flick or straight narrative.  We start off with a title card saying the film we will watch is a 70's era ""lost footage"" film of a ghost experiment gone wrong, then a more modern version of the same thing (hard to know exactly because the film never tells us) where a girl is snatched into darkness by what I guess was a ghost, then we move forward a couple of years to see a douche and a hot girl living in a huge mansion in the desert.  This all happens in about 10 minutes, and there is no apparent link between any of the 3 time periods.  And no, there is no reference back to the title card which said it would be a movie set in the 70's.  One of the worst beginnings to a movie of all the times.  I mean, MANOS THE HANDS OF FATE bad.Like all films which have tried to combine the POV stylings of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT with old fashioned film making (good lighting, dollyshots, cranes, etc), THE APPARITION super fails.  Neither style is scary in the slightest as executed in this junk heap, and while the film mostly settles on straight narrative, by the time it does you just don't care.  CHERNOBYL DIARIES actually scarier and more effective using this style, and that saying something because that movie crapped the bed.Speaking of crap, it cost Silver/Time Warner $17 mil to make this piece of poo, so it will never have the indie charm and re-watchability of an Ed Wood movie or BIRDEMIC.  Nope - this is just a big stinking waste of money and time.  The music is God awful and while the editors try to save it (in fact, I think the whole first ten minutes was done from re-shoots and lots o re-editing), but it's so heavily cut in a failed attempt to be stylized that simply becomes laughable.Think GHOSTBUSTERS meets PARANORMAL ACTIVITY but without any laughs or scares.  Or anything.  It's a like a 14 year wrote it, forgot about it, then found again after he graduated film school and made it as is.  Just about the least scary film you'll ever see (equal in it's awfulness to the dreadful remake of SOMEONE'S WATCHING ME).  It's a little like FLATLINERS but with a much dumber script and ZERO actual style.The only redeeming quality about the film is Ashley Greene as Kelly.  She's like the pretty version of Kristen Stewart that can act a little... but certainly not enough to actually save THE CRAPARITION.BOTTOM LINE: 1 oh my God I thought I was going to see THE POSSESSION but hit the wrong button out of 5",1,The poster looks scary anyway,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,2660,"['So', 'Joel', 'Silver', 'heard', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'was', 'making', 'lot', 'money', 'so', 'tried', 'hand', 'letting', 'first', 'time', 'director/writer', 'Todd', 'Lincoln', 'actually', 'do', 'dirty', 'work.Oy', 'Right', 'bat', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'POV', 'flick', 'straight', 'narrative', 'start', 'off', 'title', 'card', 'saying', 'film', 'will', 'watch', '70', 'era', 'lost', 'footage', 'film', 'ghost', 'experiment', 'gone', 'wrong', 'then', 'more', 'modern', 'version', 'same', 'thing', 'hard', 'know', 'exactly', 'film', 'never', 'where', 'girl', 'snatched', 'darkness', 'what', 'guess', 'was', 'ghost', 'then', 'move', 'forward', 'couple', 'years', 'see', 'douche', 'hot', 'girl', 'living', 'huge', 'mansion', 'desert', '10', 'minutes', 'apparent', 'link', '3', 'time', 'periods', 'reference', 'back', 'title', 'card', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'set', '70', 'One', 'worst', 'beginnings', 'movie', 'times', 'mean', 'MANOS', 'THE', 'HANDS', 'OF', 'FATE', 'films', 'have', 'tried', 'combine', 'POV', 'stylings', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'old', 'fashioned', 'film', 'making', 'good', 'lighting', 'dollyshots', 'cranes', 'etc', 'APPARITION', 'super', 'style', 'scary', 'slightest', 'executed', 'junk', 'heap', 'film', 'mostly', 'straight', 'narrative', 'time', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'CHERNOBYL', 'DIARIES', 'actually', 'scarier', 'more', 'effective', 'using', 'style', 'saying', 'something', 'movie', 'crapped', 'bed.Speaking', 'crap', 'cost', 'Silver/Time', 'Warner', '17', 'mil', 'make', 'piece', 'poo', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'indie', 'charm', 're-watchability', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'movie', 'BIRDEMIC', 'Nope', 'just', 'big', 'stinking', 'waste', 'money', 'time', 'music', 'God', 'awful', 'editors', 'try', 'save', 'fact', 'think', 'whole', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'was', 'done', 're-shoots', 'lots', 're-editing', 'so', 'heavily', 'cut', 'failed', 'attempt', 'be', 'stylized', 'simply', 'laughable.Think', 'GHOSTBUSTERS', 'meets', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'laughs', 'scares', 'anything', '14', 'year', 'wrote', 'forgot', 'then', 'found', 'again', 'graduated', 'film', 'school', 'made', 'Just', 'least', 'scary', 'film', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'equal', 'awfulness', 'dreadful', 'remake', 'SOMEONE', 'WATCHING', 'ME', 'little', 'like', 'FLATLINERS', 'much', 'dumber', 'script', 'ZERO', 'actual', 'style.The', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'film', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'Kelly', 'pretty', 'version', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'can', 'act', 'little', 'certainly', 'not', 'enough', 'actually', 'save', 'THE', 'CRAPARITION.BOTTOM', 'LINE', '1', 'God', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'POSSESSION', 'hit', 'wrong', 'button', '5']",N/A

1600679,A3V79KXIY09MOE,B009NRQTA6,"Stacy ""Amazon Junkie""","[1, 3]","I have seen some bad movies in my time. I am a fan of the series &#34;Mystery Science Theatre 3000&#34;, which ripped on older bad movies. But The Apparition... this movie is in a class by itself. Putting aside the fact that the entire cast is just phoning it in (including the neighbor's dog), the plot and storyline is so clich&eacute; that I already had most of the plot figured out within the first ten minutes of the movie.So, without much fanfare, lets list the flaws. I'll try and keep the spoilers to a minimum, but really I am trying to prevent you from wasting your time and money on this flick. However, in the interest of fairness I will alert you beforehand if a plot point is exposed so that you can move on to the next point.1) The two main protagonists: Kelly (Ashley Greene) and Ben (Sebastian Stan) are supposedly a couple who live together in this beautiful, upscale housing community in California. Kelly is a vet tech and Ben is a TV/cable generic technology guy. Aside from the fact that they are polar opposites, their chemistry together initially made me think that Ben is a serial killer. Any intimate contact seems forced.2) *Minimal Spoilers, this is revealed at the beginning of the movie* The plot is simple: film footage shows a s&eacute;ance with a group of people from the 60s or 70s using a painting of a man that looks like an Edward Munch reject, and manage to get a reaction. Fast forward to years later, a group of (presumably) college students with fancy equipment decide to repeat the experiment, only THIS time they will get him to stick around in this vaguely-looking clay doll. Something goes wrong.3) So you have this &#34;evil&#34; apparition floating around. Between moving the dresser a foot away so that &#34;Kelly&#34; had to *omg* turn around to put clothes away, and then it *scream* watched her in the SHOWER!! *swoon*, the first half the the movie makes the monster more concerned with killing plants and vandalizing property. Quick! Call an insurance adjuster!4) While Kelly was in the shower, she made darn sure to stand at odd angles (you couldn't see her directly, only as a silhouette through the curtain) and to clean herself slowly. The same thing happened when she got out; she had to dry off and bend over to get clothes on one painful step at a time, accentuating her figure/apparent sexiness. It was quite clear that the director told her to do this as no one in their right mind would act like that on their own.5) The relationship between the two protagonists never improves. I'm fairly sure they're siblings.In the EndAt this point all that I can say is that I am sure this movie constitutes the definition of a horrible weapon and is in violation of the Geneva Convention.

Things don't go that well for Patrick (Tom Felton, Draco from ""Harry Potter"") and his crew as something has happened.The film jumps again to Ben (Sebastian Stan) who was part of the experiment and Kelly (Ashley Greene, Alice from ""Twilight"" ) one of the world's worse house sitters. Their house number is ""2812"" which flashes for a moment. It adds up to 13, although we really don't need a premonition of things to come.

I also liked the way they integrated the ""found footage"" into the film and didn't rely strictly on it. Thank you Todd Lincoln. Ashley Kelly, who was allowed to act in ""Twilight"" gives us a good performance in this one in spite of Sebastian Stan being unconvincing in his part.

It seems that Patrick continued the experiment after Ben cut off all contact with him. The creature manifests itself in Kelly's house as black mold, what looks like a black wasp's nest and the creature appearing as a woman at one point.Unfortunately, the story is so poorly told that it's almost like the film is a series of disconnected ""scare"" scenes with a story tacked on after the fact. Good horror films require rules that explain what and why is occurring so we can understand the motivation of the creature or, at the very least, explain the attacks on those in the film. None of this occurs because writer/director Todd Lincoln can't tell a coherent story to save his life. Running a slight 82 minutes including the credits, the film has little in the way of story to hang the horror set pieces of the film on.Perhaps there was the film went through signficant re-editing but what we are served here makes little sense and the story generates so little tension that it's like watching a bad SyFy original movie. Even the actors can't generate any level of interest in the material. Actor Felton from the Harry Potter films has little more than a glorified cameo in the movie and that's probably because he realized what a bad movie he had stumbled into.END OF SPOILERS:The Blu-ray looks decent although the image quality is so soft that it really doesn't justify an HD transfer nor HD viewing.The audio sounds quite good with a nice 5.1 mix that makes good use of the format with directional sound effects as well as crystal clear dialogue.The special features are as slight as the film. We get four featurettes that run under 30 minutes. The first features the cast and members of the crew discussing the film. The second focuses on ghost consultant Joshua P. Warren. The third and fourth feature Warren discussing Asheville, North Carolina the most ""haunted"" city in the U.S. and the latter is a recreation of the experiment from the beginning set in 1973 where a group of ghost hunters try to conjure the spirit of one of their deceased members named Charles. Needless to say, nothing happens although a brief text at the conclusion claims that ""something"" was released.

She yells for the help of a big strong man to come to her rescue.At the end of the movie we don't even really know what happens.  Is she in the real world?  Is she in the ghost world?  Is she dead?  Is she possessed?  We don't know.

I need something more solid and something that tells me what happened.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***In the end this was not a horror movie and it wasn't even a scary movie, it's more like some random images and ideas from other horror movies that were thrown together, put in a blender and a half-naked semi-attractive woman was tossed in just for good measure.Save your time and save your money and go watch something else that's actually worth 90 minutes of your time.",1,Just Stupid!,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,2768,"['movie', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'horrible', 'wanted', 'see', 'theaters', 'am', 'SOOO', 'glad', 'waited', 'came', 'Redbox', 'see', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'paying', '10', 'bucks', 'see', 'thing', '***SPOILERS***', '***SPOILERS***The', 'plot', 'device', 'students', 'conducting', 'experiment', 'doorway', 'dimension', 'just', 'so', 'lame', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'was', 'done', 'Pulse', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'looking', 'see', 'how', 'whole', 'tagline', 'movie', 'Once', 'believe', 'die', 'play', 'never', 'explained', ""n't"", 'play', 'role', 'film.This', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'was', 'just', 'bunch', 'flickering', 'lights', 'mold', 'walls', 'broken', 'doll', 'once', 'while', 'shadows', 'moving', 'background', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'jump', 'movie', 'even', 'TRY', 'make', 'scary', 'movie', 'also', 'too', 'heavily', 'main', 'actress', 'Ashley', 'Greene', 'prancing', 'around', 'underwear', 'bikini', 'whatever', 'hell', 'thing', 'was', 'was', 'wearing.The', 'ghost', 'motivation', 'very', 'poorly', 'explained', 'just', 'be', 'alive', 'Okay', 'motivation', 'single', 'ghost', 'single', 'ghost', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'even', 'Casper', 'Friendly', 'Ghost', 'had', 'motivation', 'top', 'one', 'point', 'main', 'actress', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'character', 'name', 'was', 'so', 'boring', 'one-dimensional', 'room', 'ghost', 'floor', 'hands', 'knees', 'looking', 'up', 'holding', 'HAMMER', 'hand', 'Okay', 'so', 'why', ""n't"", 'just', 'smash', 'thing', 'head', 'hammer', 'try', 'kill', 'mean', 'what', ""'d"", 'do', 'something', 'creepy', 'showed', 'up', 'house', 'intentions', 'were', 'unknown', 'what', 'other', 'stupid', 'female', 'character', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'knock-off', 'movies', 'help', 'big', 'strong', 'man', 'come', 'rescue.At', 'end', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'real', 'world', 'ghost', 'world', 'dead', 'possessed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'know', 'film-makers', 'leave', 'up', 'audience', 'come', 'conclusion', 'what', 'happened', 'leaving', 'ending', 'open', 'over', 'used', 'days', 'need', 'something', 'more', 'solid', 'something', 'what', 'happened', '***END', 'SPOILERS***', '***END', 'SPOILERS***', '***END', 'SPOILERS***In', 'end', 'was', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'scary', 'movie', 'more', 'random', 'images', 'ideas', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'were', 'thrown', 'together', 'put', 'blender', 'half-naked', 'semi-attractive', 'woman', 'was', 'tossed', 'just', 'good', 'measure.Save', 'time', 'save', 'money', 'go', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'actually', 'worth', '90', 'minutes', 'time']",N/A
