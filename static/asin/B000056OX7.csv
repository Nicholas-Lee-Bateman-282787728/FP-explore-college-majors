I own over dozens of anime series, and this instantly became my all-time favorite. The video is top notch, and both the Japanese and English voices are good.When Jinto's planet is conquered by the Abh Empire, Jinto is made an Abh nobleman. The series chronicles his and a noblewoman's travels together. This anime is based on a book rather than a manga, and that influence is obvious. The characters spend quite a bit of time talking about their lives and experiences. Moreover, each episode is like a chapter in a book, rather than a complete story. This means that the story progresses pretty slowly. I like this, but some people may not. If you're new to anime, you may wish to check out more popular shows like Tenchi Muyo! or Ranma 1/2. If you're tired of all the comedies and mecca shows, give this disc a try. It's worth the price of admission.The only problem I have with this show is that only 4 DVDs have been released so far. I've heard that two more series exist in Japan, and I'm breathlessly awaiting them.",5,Wow.

I like some of the art. I like many of the concepts. Yet, this first disc left me somewhat cold.Neither the dubbing nor the subtitling seemed to fit very well to what was going on, at times. The voice acting was, on occasion, atrocious (e.g., the blonde woman near the beginning of the first ep, who explains that the Abh are pretty much elves); but the English subtitling seemed off-key somehow, too.There is very little action in the first eps; and I was confused by the fact that many of the scenes seemed to have a sort of filmy filter over them. I decided later that these were flashforward scenes; but I'm still not sure if I've guessed this correctly. For instance, the first ep opens with a space battle taking place, but it seems to have no bearing whatsoever on the plot. The cliffhanger at the end of the disc's last episode, however, seems to have many of the same scenes and situations. Also, there is a short scene involving what looks like a nuclear attack on the hero's homeworld, which certainly seems to be a flashforward (I recall that it is even presented in some sort of ironic contrast to the material surrounding it). The flashforward motif makes sense, given that the hero is narrating the whole thing from some point in the future. I only wish I could be more sure that this was the proper interpretation. Well, that's anime, I guess.&lt;g&gt;Normally I try to grade a book or film primarily on objective criteria, and less on my own subjective response. But the objective criteria seems to be cancelling each other out on this one, so I'm left with my gut reaction which is, &quot;Eh...&quot; (and a &lt;shrug&gt;).On the other hand, I have pre-ordered the next two discs in the series. Whether I end up actually buying installment 3, though, depends on what happens during installment 2. Here's hoping it'll be worth it.",3,Well...

Wilson ""empire03""","[3, 12]","When this DVD was referred to me, I was curious...When I saw it, I saw nothing special, and at times, I saw nothing good...The story revolves around a story that's too common in anime, a plucky, yet somewhat lost hero, and his companion/love interest who is infinitely stronger, but very naive.The story takes forever to unfold, and when it finally does, you wonder if it was worth the trip.  To add to it, the soundtrack is horribly out of place, fraught with woodwinds that would have been more applicable to a series with a more organic feel, or sci-fi of the 70's.On the whole, this is a series that is better skipped.  There's much more promising titles out there that should have your hard earned money put towards.",1,Overhyped,1014076800,"02 19, 2002",2002,721,"['When', 'DVD', 'was', 'referred', 'was', 'curious', 'When', 'saw', 'saw', 'nothing', 'special', 'times', 'saw', 'nothing', 'good', 'story', 'around', 'story', 'too', 'common', 'anime', 'plucky', 'somewhat', 'lost', 'hero', 'companion/love', 'interest', 'who', 'infinitely', 'stronger', 'very', 'naive.The', 'story', 'forever', 'unfold', 'when', 'finally', 'wonder', 'was', 'worth', 'trip', 'add', 'soundtrack', 'horribly', 'place', 'fraught', 'woodwinds', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'applicable', 'series', 'more', 'organic', 'feel', 'sci-fi', ""70's.On"", 'whole', 'series', 'better', 'skipped', 'much', 'more', 'promising', 'titles', 'out', 'there', 'that', 'should', 'have', 'hard', 'earned', 'money', 'put', 'towards']",N/A
570178,A39QL8RQCENWQF,B000056OX7,"R. Preisinger ""picah""","[6, 8]","First word that comes to mind about this series: slow, slow, slow. HOWEVER, it is different from faster paced anime and I appreciate that. It is as though you are watching every minute of Jinto's life, but you're not. This method really captures the obvious differences and misunderstanding of each race. It also seems to let you marinate in the moment. The jumping back in time gets rather choppy, but it does add to the suspense of Jinto's past.Jinto seems to be a typical anime boy character (young, innocent, humble, reluctant hero, father issues). He does grow on you. The Abh girl, Lafiel has that predictable sweet charm, yet determination to prove herself. I rather enjoyed how they portrayed the sophisticated Abh race. They have an appealing nature about them that leaves you wanting to learn more about them.The dubbed English is not too bad and the characters are very interesting. The intro is odd, but bearable. Some scenes are a bit painful to watch since everything seems to be going at such a slow pace.Overall, I found myself intrigued and willing to finish out the series. Highly recommend to someone who wants to broaden their horizons.",4,Pretty much hooked....,1035244800,"10 22, 2002",2002,1156,"['First', 'word', 'mind', 'series', 'slow', 'slow', 'slow', 'HOWEVER', 'different', 'faster', 'paced', 'anime', 'appreciate', 'are', 'watching', 'minute', 'Jinto', 'life', ""'re"", 'not', 'method', 'really', 'obvious', 'differences', 'misunderstanding', 'race', 'also', 'let', 'marinate', 'moment', 'jumping', 'back', 'time', 'rather', 'choppy', 'add', 'suspense', 'Jinto', 'past.Jinto', 'be', 'typical', 'anime', 'boy', 'character', 'young', 'innocent', 'humble', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'father', 'issues', 'grow', 'Abh', 'girl', 'Lafiel', 'predictable', 'sweet', 'charm', 'determination', 'prove', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'portrayed', 'sophisticated', 'Abh', 'race', 'have', 'appealing', 'nature', 'wanting', 'learn', 'more', 'them.The', 'dubbed', 'English', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'intro', 'odd', 'bearable', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'painful', 'watch', 'everything', 'be', 'going', 'slow', 'pace.Overall', 'found', 'intrigued', 'willing', 'finish', 'out', 'series', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'someone', 'who', 'broaden', 'horizons']",N/A
570179,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B000056OX7,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[7, 8]","Crest of the Stars. I've seen a few anime in my time, but this one is different in several respects from your average anime show. For starters, it's the slowest moving anime I have ever seen. Things that would happen in one episode in another series happen in two or three episodes here. And while there IS action (space battles and shootouts) they are few and far between. Nor is the plot very complex or mind-blowing in nature.What makes this series engaging is characterization and attention to detail. Many of the characters say and do things that leave you wondering just what they are actually thinking. For instance, the first episodes have everyone saying that Jinto's father sold out his planet and betrayed everyone. Yet, what we see onscreen and what people later say about it suggests the opposite. Was Jinto's father really saving his planet from total destruction? And what of the Abh? Are they ruthless, heartless people of destruction, or a misunderstood race capable of great loyalty and kindness? I don't know. I may have to see this series quite a few times to figure everything out. If you want something to sink your teeth into intellectually, this series is it.Technically, this is also a very interesting series. The music is a beautiful orchestral masterpiece. The animation ranges from very good to breath-taking. But the English dub of the voices doesn't match the characters very well. And even in the excellent Japanese dub, the lip-synching is ocassionally so far off it becomes distracting. And then there is the Japanese text. At the beginning of the series, it seems like it's everywhere. At times you'll have Japanese text with English text on top, and it feels a bit overwhelming (on tv they put a black blank on top of the Japanese text so it wouldn't distract).So all in all, I recommend this series to hard-core sci-fi fans and die-hard anime fans looking for something different and having the patience for a show that's isn't full of action and violence, but instead relies on old-fashioned character development. I look forward to the next season.",4,Kin of the Stars,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,2087,"['Crest', 'Stars', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'anime', 'time', 'one', 'different', 'several', 'respects', 'average', 'anime', 'show', 'starters', 'slowest', 'moving', 'anime', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Things', 'would', 'happen', 'one', 'episode', 'series', 'happen', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'here', 'IS', 'action', 'space', 'battles', 'shootouts', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'plot', 'very', 'complex', 'mind-blowing', 'series', 'engaging', 'characterization', 'attention', 'detail', 'Many', 'characters', 'say', 'do', 'things', 'leave', 'wondering', 'just', 'what', 'are', 'actually', 'thinking', 'instance', 'first', 'episodes', 'have', 'everyone', 'saying', 'Jinto', 'father', 'sold', 'out', 'planet', 'betrayed', 'everyone', 'what', 'see', 'onscreen', 'what', 'people', 'later', 'say', 'opposite', 'Was', 'Jinto', 'father', 'really', 'saving', 'planet', 'total', 'destruction', 'what', 'Abh', 'Are', 'ruthless', 'heartless', 'people', 'destruction', 'misunderstood', 'race', 'capable', 'great', 'loyalty', 'kindness', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'may', 'have', 'see', 'series', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'figure', 'everything', 'out', 'want', 'something', 'sink', 'teeth', 'intellectually', 'series', 'it.Technically', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'series', 'music', 'beautiful', 'orchestral', 'masterpiece', 'animation', 'very', 'good', 'breath-taking', 'English', 'dub', 'voices', ""n't"", 'match', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'even', 'excellent', 'Japanese', 'dub', 'lip-synching', 'ocassionally', 'so', 'far', 'distracting', 'then', 'Japanese', 'text', 'beginning', 'series', 'everywhere', 'times', ""'ll"", 'have', 'Japanese', 'text', 'English', 'text', 'top', 'bit', 'overwhelming', 'tv', 'put', 'black', 'blank', 'top', 'Japanese', 'text', 'would', ""n't"", 'distract', '.So', 'recommend', 'series', 'hard-core', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'die-hard', 'anime', 'fans', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'having', 'patience', 'show', ""n't"", 'full', 'action', 'violence', 'instead', 'relies', 'old-fashioned', 'character', 'development', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'season']",N/A
