Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[1, 1]","While I generally enjoyed this show, I did not like the herky-jerky movements of the characters as they walked or ran. Too, the wall crawling overly mimicked the quick crawling moves of a hobo spider. Spiderman looked like an arachnid when he moved and this went beyond what I'd been used to with hte character's movements.I liked the presentations of ESU campus. Although if you look closely enough you will see the same stock characters as ""extras"" in multiple locations throughout the city! I mean the animators could at least have changed a hairstyle or skin color or jacket! The new foes and retconned enemies added to the show's complexity. I also liked seeing characters die and/or be seriously wounded. It added a realism seldom seen in even adult-oriented television cartoons.This series showed how powerful Spiderman is. No one can stop him! The only baddies that have a chance are supervillains, and even they fall up short. If I were to encounter Spiderman I would beg him to let me go--beg him for another chance other than prison; for despite his extreme power, he does have a heart and might show mercy if a baddie could explain his situation and be contrite.This show ranks at #3 all time behind the 1990s TV series and The Spectacular Spiderman of 2009. The ranking might change should Spiderman and His Amazing Friends ever be released onto DVD. As it stands, this DVD more than holds its own in the Spiderman pantheon.Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed.A.

But if you haven't seen this shortlived hit, you need to experience it.  This version has more of a comicbook feel to it because it was geared toward an older audience.  Young adults, I believe.  But it felt more real than any other animated version I've been introduced to.  I grew up watching the animated series seen on Fox and that will always be my favorite, but until they release that on dvd, like they're ever going to, we have this to enjoy.  And in this version, Spidy gets to punch out the villains as much as his heart desires.  That's one thing the creaters of the 1994 animated series were forbidden to do...  To allow Spidy to throw a punch because those were the days when all that antiviolence stuff was going on.But anywho, this set features all 13 episodes from the series.  I only wish that more had been created.  That's the problem with American animated series today.  Too many people enjoy Anime and don't give stuff like this a chance anymore.We get to see such clasic villains as the Lizard, Kingpin, and Electro.  New but interesting villains include the Terradax organization, and a few more surprises as well.  So you'll enjoy this series if you purchus it.  The audio commentaries are great too.

It's pretty good, it more than makes up for the atrocity that was Spider-man Unlimited from 1999-2000.  It's more or less about even with the '94 show.  There's quite a few special features, and they're the usual sort you can find on a DVD, such as commentary, trailers, behind-the-scenes stuff, and the rest, but the episodes themselves are quite interesting.  Best of all, the episodes are placed IN ORDER, something MTV failed to do, which is why the problems with the Electro episodes caused some confusion.  There's quite a bit of talent, starring Neil Patrick Harris and Lisa Loeb, as well as guests like Rob Zombie(as the Lizard!  PS, Lizard fans may lose it when they see his episode), Micheal Clark Duncan(reprising his role of the Kingpin from the Daredevil movie), Edward Asner, Jennifer Hale, Rino Romano(all three having done voices in previous Spidey cartoons), Tara Strong(stalking Spidey!), Micheal Dorn(as Kraven), and of course, Stan Lee himself.

Very glad I did!It took just a little while to get used to the graphics, but then I found myself really getting into the stories. Sure, the stories and situations are different from the comics, but the characterization of Peter/Spider-man is spot on. I think this series captured his angst and personality as Peter and his wit and agility as Spider-man. His abilities have never been more accurately portrayed.

I heard about this upcoming mtv series very early on and was in front of my tv for the premiere, and for the following few weeks. What I found when I tuned in was a beautifully animated show, with some nice ideas and characters, that ultimately fell short because of its scripts. The major problem with Spider-man the tv show was that it was a half hour in length. This gave the writers zero time to get you to the villian, have them fight spider-man, and then come to a resolution. Because of this alot of the episodes felt rushed, and alot of the endings were over the top. It's hard to end an episode in 5 min without making it seem like a really cheesy way to defeat a super villian. Maybe if it was an hour long like the much acclaimed smallville, it would have had a chance to flesh out its stories.

786066,ATJLR5VAS2QE5,B0000VCZLG,Garrett Aja,"[6, 8]","With the exception of Batman and Superman, Spider-Man is probably the most recognizable superhero in the world of comic books, as evidenced by a live action TV show, a movie (with impending sequel), and a whopping *six* animated series produced over the years. While the live action TV show was awful beyond belief and the movie a smashing success, the cartoons have been another matter. The '60s cartoon was a true product of its time, with limited animation (albeit a lot less limited than some of the cartoons for Spidey's Marvel contemporaries) and the now-infamous theme song. Marvel Productions' 1981 syndicated series was a boring affair with little of the famous Spider-Man personality, while the &quot;Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends&quot; series that began the same year (and teamed Spidey up with Iceman and the created-for-TV Firestar) was an astounding success (if somewhat dated by its attempts to fit NBC's often aggravating content requirements). The 1995 series was a jumbled attempt to retell many of the classic comic stories in an environment altered to fit modern perceptions of the character, and the follow-up series was doomed from the start due to heavy interference from the Fox Network.All this brings us to this newest animated Spider-Man, which follows the movie and was produced for MTV with the hopes of &quot;modernizing&quot; the character. Using cel-shaded CGI animation, the series was a success for MTV, but like so many of their shows, has been cut loose almost before audiences had a chance to find it, and before the series was even close to reaching its potential. Despite MTV's bungling (which saw an emphasis on appearances by MTV-worthy artists like Eve and a de-emphasis on characters ranging from Aunt May to Flash Thompson to Doctor Octopus, as well as &quot;hip&quot; references to recent movies and shows), the show had potential. However, the animation is lacking (as the characters, like in just about every CGI series by Mainframe that I've seen, move robotically), and the DVD features even admit that the character and set designs were sorely limited by the CGI style used. Also, some of the new characters (Indy seems to be the whipping girl here) are ill developed, especially when there are better alternatives (i.e., Felicia Hardy) in the Spider-Man mythos. Also, the voice acting choices (beyond the rock stars involved) are often lacking compared to previous Spider-Man series, and skewed too much towards live action stars (Neil Patrick Harris, Ian Ziering, and James Marsters come to mind).The DVD features are a nice mix, with factoids, commentaries, &quot;outtakes&quot;, and developmental animation.

Compared to previous animated Spidey's this was bold move, taking it in new, more mature and realistic directions. The 60's and 90's shows seem tame and childish in comparison.Taking place after the Spider-Man movie this show revolves around the college adventures of Peter, Mary-Jane and Harry who have much better chemistry, character and dialogue than the movie ever offered. Each episode provides more drama and development and creativity. The stories are very imaginative and are obviously written by people who are passionate about Spiderman rather than a studio hashing a product together.The computer animation is superb and resembles The Ultimate Spiderman comic book (my fave) more than anything. And I know Mary-Jane is only a CGI character but she is so beautiful, and she's voiced by the equally gorgeous Lisa Loeb. Neil Patrick Harris is the voice of Peter Parker and even in this performance he is a hundred times better than Tobey Maguire.The show also offers some new, interesting characters like Indy, Cheyenne and Silver Sable and gives us alternate takes on Electro and Kraven. Though I was curious as to why Aunt May was not involved.There is plenty of action and excitement to be had in every episode, all backed up to great music, MAN IS THAT THEME TUNE AWESOME! Where is the soundtrack CD?The show could not have asked for a better DVD presentation. Not only do we get an absolutely stunning 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation but a thumpingly good, totally engaging DTS 5.1 soundtrack too. Each episode is a 22-minute movie that is far superior to anything the live-action effort was. There are also an abundance of extras on this 2-disc set, some interesting, some not. But a seriously good package for a great show. You must buy!

Many people act like it was the greatest thing ever, but it was garbage. It was so heavily censored that Spider-Man was not allowed to throw punches. They also made Spidey a weakling. In one episode, Kingpin nearly crushed him to death (he only escaped after Green Goblin inadvertently saved him). In another episode, the Lizard attacked Spidey and he had to be rescued by Storm and Iron Man. The heroes who guest starred in that series regularly outshone Spidey.This series was so much better. Spidey had his trademark sense of humor. Like many people said, it had a lot of sexual innuendo (I have a huge crush on Indy). There were also some adult themes (Spidey even had to deal with a stalker). No one under 14 should watch it. However, if you're a true Spider-Man fan you'll appreciate it. Many people have complained that Spider-Man does not fight his iconic villains like Venom and Doc Ock and while that is a legitimate complaint, I was happy to see new villains. He can only fight the same people so many times. I did not like the 3D graphics of the series, but that shouldn't deter people from buying this DVD. Each storyline was interesting and the fight scenes were well done. Since it was on at 10PM, they didn't have to worry about censors. I was so addicted to this series when I first watched it in 2003.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[14, 20]","Just because Brian Michael Bendis serves as executive producer doesn't mean you can expect the same kind of brilliant writing you get in his various comics.  MTV's New Adventures of Spider-Man finds the wall crawler in yet another animated series (I've lost count how many times the Marvel hero has starred in his own animated show) this time created by Mainframe: the same folks who brought us the computer animated Reboot and Transformers: Beast Wars.  Using a computer generated cell-shaded design to present the show, Spidey looks great while he's webslinging, but everyday movements of normal people look jerky.  The story of this series picks up after the mega hit film with Spidey/Peter Parker (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris), his friend Harry Osborne (Ian Ziering), and his longtime crush Mary Jane Watson (Lisa Loeb) in college and features the webslinger taking on classic enemies like Kraven and The Lizard as well as new villians designed specifically for the show.  It's a notion that longtime fans of Spider-Man will either love or loathe as this collected first season offers a mixed bag of animation, voice acting, and storytelling.  Guest voices range from solid (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's James Marsters) to lackluster (rapper Eve) and it will really depend on the fan whether or not they'll find the series enjoyable.  MTV has since dropped the series after airing it's first season, but my recommendation is that this new show is worth checking out, but many are better left sticking with the comics.",3,Mixed bag to be sure,1077148800,"02 19, 2004",2004,1521,"['Just', 'Brian', 'Michael', 'Bendis', 'executive', 'producer', ""n't"", 'mean', 'can', 'expect', 'same', 'kind', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'get', 'various', 'comics', 'MTV', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Spider-Man', 'wall', 'crawler', 'yet', 'animated', 'series', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'Marvel', 'hero', 'starred', 'own', 'animated', 'show', 'time', 'created', 'Mainframe', 'same', 'folks', 'who', 'brought', 'computer', 'animated', 'Reboot', 'Transformers', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'Using', 'computer', 'generated', 'cell-shaded', 'design', 'present', 'show', 'Spidey', 'great', 'webslinging', 'everyday', 'movements', 'normal', 'people', 'look', 'jerky', 'story', 'series', 'up', 'mega', 'hit', 'film', 'Spidey/Peter', 'Parker', 'voiced', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'friend', 'Harry', 'Osborne', 'Ian', 'Ziering', 'longtime', 'crush', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Lisa', 'Loeb', 'college', 'webslinger', 'taking', 'classic', 'enemies', 'Kraven', 'Lizard', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'villians', 'designed', 'specifically', 'show', 'notion', 'longtime', 'fans', 'Spider-Man', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'loathe', 'collected', 'first', 'season', 'mixed', 'bag', 'animation', 'voice', 'acting', 'storytelling', 'Guest', 'voices', 'range', 'solid', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'James', 'Marsters', 'lackluster', 'rapper', 'Eve', 'will', 'really', 'depend', 'fan', 'not', ""'ll"", 'find', 'series', 'enjoyable', 'MTV', 'dropped', 'series', 'airing', 'first', 'season', 'recommendation', 'new', 'show', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'many', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'sticking', 'comics']",Spider-Man: The New Animated Series

Hardy,"[6, 8]","In an attempt to revamp Spider-man yet again because the awsome movie directed by Sam Rami (Xena: Warrior Princess), Spider-man the new animated series: Season 1 was created. Its not bad I've watched it while it was one MTV. its supposedly takes place after the first movie; the characters seem to be the same (as much as the same a revamped character can remain) Peters still brooding over Mary Jane while getting every other girl in between, Harry's protrayed as a playboy (much to my dismay), and Mary Jane is still brooding over Peter's inablility to commit to her. The orignal comic book villians: The Kingpin, the Lizard (whom is only shown for a few minutes at best) and The Shocker manage to stay in almost-complete character surprisingly. But like in every other Superhero-revamp TV show there are stupid uncessary villains I've never even heard of in the comic book like the Japanese samurai woman, the Twins with physic powers, the nerd obsessed with Spiderman, and the white-haired assassin chick among others.The plots for each episode aren't bad and run smoothly at times save for the first episode. However, it cannot be un-adressed that the animation in this show really needs working on: For example, when Peter runs off to save the day at times he looks as though he's about to ram you with his head. In other words he's sorta bent over. The facial animations are almost identical right down to the ""what gives?"" expression.Lastly the motion animations are still as stiff and unrealistic as a video-game characters are. Plus I couldn't shake the feeling that MTV's putting Well-known celebrities voices (Eve, Rob Zombie, etc.) in the show was some kind of selling-point. Lastly the voice acting isn't bad however its not great either. The voice actors are lacking in some serious talent here (including Eve and Rob Zombie).Peter, Mary Jane, and Harry all sound like and have dialouge that sounds like something out of ""Everwood"" or ""Gilmore girls"" or  better yet the late ""Buffy: the vampire slayer/Angel."" There is also implied sexual content, swearing and volince. All in all Spider-man: The new animated series isn't bad, just don't expect anything great here.

Let me tell ya folks, this is a great series...for several reasons.1) The CG animation, although a bit awkward at times with ""regular"" human movement and such, it really shines during the Spidey and villian ""battles"".  Just the fact that the animation is all in 3D (put with a 2D look), allows the camera to do some really interesting things, from pans, to spins, to rotations, and fly-thrus, and of course, the ultra-cool slo-mo effects.  This kind of camera control is something that just isn't possible in a traditionally hand-drawn cartoon.2) The action sequences in general.  This isn't your grandfather's Spider-Man.  Much like Mainframe Entertainment's other CG shows, the action is much more mature than your ordinary animated show.  By that I mean the fight scenes and the ""chases"" are much more intense and, shall I say, violent than anything else I've seen in a cartoon such as this.  In fact, there's actually moments of blood from both Spidey and his enemies.  And as some of you may know, blood is almost always a ""no-no"" for childrens' animated shows.  So just with that, the viewer can easily tell that this show was made for a much more mature audience, which is always good in this circumstance, especially for comic book heroes.3) The audio and video presentation.  The video is presented in 1.78 anamorphic widescreen and is extremely sharp.  Even looks good on a computer via DVD-ROM drive.  And the soundtrack is recorded in both DTS and DD 5.1 (always a plus for any show, eh?)  Also the widescreen presentation gives the show a bit of a epic cinematic feel to it.  How many cartoons do you know that were created in widescreen?4) The villians.  The villians, some classic (with new looks), others new, were all great with maybe the exception of one, but that's to one's taste.  I thought the Terradax group were awesome.  Their suits and weapons were just too cool.  And again, the maturity of the dialogue for the villians and actions are just what makes these villians great.So with all that said, let's all hope that this series gets picked up by some outlet for another season or more.  I'd love to see what the creators could do with the Venon and Carnage saga.  Hell, even Doc Oc, Green Goblin, and Hobgoblin would be great.  But can we get Parker out of college?  Being almost 10 years out myself, I despise the college atmosphere anymore.

786088,A1IUH51WI1TTSP,B0000VCZLG,Sam A. Milazzo,"[7, 10]","I've been wanting to see this for ages!!  And finally I rented it.  I really enjoyed it.  This show isn't excatly a link between the 1st movie and the sequel, but just a movie-tv-series sort of thing, although I was surprised how both this TV Series and Movie 2 had the same incident:  Mary Jane is acting on stage, Peter says he'll come, ""You're coming?"" Mary Jane says (in both!) and of course he doesn't make it in time.  All 13 episodes go for 20 -and-a-half mins.The Enemies we see are Turbo Jet (either from the comic or not, I'm unsure - halfway through the episode I knew who he was), the Lizard (Connors is pretty tense and more annoying than he ever has been before - in this design the Lizard does not wear clothes, and is more wild), Kraven the Hunter, Electro (designed much better than ever before), Silver Sable, Kingpin (mix-up of original comic & Michael Clark Duncan version from DareDevil, same actor), and we even meet some new ones like the 'Psycho' Gain twins (I HATE THEM!!), 2 Big Motorcycle buys (forgot their names, sorry!), Shikata, Talon, Christina (crazy!!) and 'Pteradox' (evil group in uniform).  I suppose Venom would've taken up too much time in the show to be included, even if he would've looked good.  In this new take of 'spider-man' all these enemies are in some way personally related to Peter Parker, so it's not just another 'Good vs Bad' show where Peter's life is made complicated by Spider-Man.  One of the returning characters on this DVD are Flash Thompson the bully, as well as a look at Peter's parents and guardians, and some other voice actors from previous versions of 'Spider-man' appear in this version too, mostly from the mid-1990's version.  The violence however, is a little more extreme: apart from getting his suit torn, he does do a bit of bleeding, and sometimes a character loses part of their body, and other times there is a SLIGHT sexual reference.  But luckily there are a lot of funny scenes where Spider-man makes jokes or is in a bit of trouble.The Special Features include 4 'Making of Features' including interviews with the cast/crew and Stan Lee, what-could-be Alternate TV Openings, Episode-Fact-Pop-Ups, (I think a look at the Game), Trailers of other Anime' and DVDs 'coming soon' and even Bloopers.  The animation is really good, although Spiderman looked muscular, he was also skinny, having slightly being modelled after ""Ultimate Spiderman"".  Just like in the earlier shows, his spider-lens-eyes open/move to match his emotions, and best of all Neil Patrick Harris does different voices for Peter Parker and Spider-Man: normal and slightly nervous for Peter but more grown-up and heroic/brave for Spider-man (but that's not the first time this happened.  It first happened in the 1960's animation).  A little mistake they make is incorrectly say when Rino Romano played Spiderman.  The Audio Commentaries talk about them discussing about making a Season 2.  I hope they do - ""maybe Season 2 will be better than Season 1"" - It certainly would help, after what happens . . . but you can just ignore the last two episodes!!  They change Mary-Jane's hair-length, but they explain why and I understand.

786093,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0000VCZLG,trebe,"[0, 0]","Computer graphic (CG) animation gives The Amazing Spider-Man - The New Animated Series (2003), a unique look, particularly when applied to a character who can practically fly, and routinely makes radical moves in three dimensional space.  It may take a while to get used to the way Spider-Man and the other CG characters move and behave, but it is very easy to get caught up in the coolness of the visual presentation.  Spidey and his foes are capable of wild moves, allowing for some intense action, and high energy battles.The cartoon seems to pick up where Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002) left off.  Peter Parker, Harry Osborn, and Mary Jane Watson, are roommates attending college.  Parker concentrates on his studies, and works as a freelance photographer for The Dailey Bugle.  MJ is trying to further her acting career.  And Harry (who again looks nothing like the original comics), is trying to come to terms with the recent death of his father, Norman (Green Goblin) Osborn, former head of the Oscorp corporation.  Spider-Man is voiced by Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother), Mary Jane by singer Lisa Loeb, and Harry by Ian Ziering.The kinds of adventures Spidey gets involved with vary widely.  The original  animated stories, draw only slightly from the character's classic comic past, with an emphasis on more modern themes and high tech aspects.  The quality of the writing runs the gamut, from excellent to poor, but the high quality of the animation helps to make each episode an interesting watch.'Sword Of Shikata' features both an cool story, and some fantastic fighting scenes with a female assassin skilled in use of the sword.  'Law of the Jungle' pays a slight nod to an original villain, as Curt Connors experiments lead to him becoming the Lizard.  The CG version of the reptilian, moves like a Jurassic Park raptor.  'Spider-Man Dis-Sabled' has a shaky premise, but features Sable, another female assassin with a strong personality.  Returning to the well, the female villain thing is featured again in 'Keeping Secrets', where Harry's new girlfriend is also a high tech thief.  The best of the lot is probably the two parter 'Mind Games', where a pair of siblings with superior mental abilities, use their powers to convince Spidey to try and kill Kraven the hunter.  It is nice to see a genuine Spidey villain featured, as it at least provides some kind of frame of reference, however slight.  Something that is largely missing in the series.The reworking of the origin of Electro in 'The Party', does not work well, and things get even worse, short circuiting in 'When Sparks Fly', when Electro returns with romance on his mind.  Another miss is 'Head Over Heels', a nutty tale, where Peter's lab partner Christina is a babbling whack job, who's mind is warped in an accident, to fixate on Spider-Man.The collection truly shines in the extras department, as the bonus materials include several featurettes, onscreen tidbits, and a plethora of commentary tracks.  Headed by executive producer Morgan Gendel, and co-executive producer Audu Paden, the various tracks provide a wealth of background information about each episode, as well as general information about different aspects of production.  You will get some understanding of things like, why the characters' wardrobe does not change, how faces are animated, and how MJ's hair moves.  The decisions of the production team was subject to approval from Sony, MTV, and who knows who else, so getting things done was not always easy.  In his commentaries Neil Patrick Harris proves to be a fun guy, and a Spidey fan as well.  Marvel comics godfather, Stan Lee, lends his vocal talents to the project, and also appears in several commentaries.  Lee, who always seems to be very much a kid at heart, expresses great enthusiasm and appreciation for the project, which he co-executive produced.  Unfortunately the series was not renewed for a second season.",4,"eye popping, high flying action, with uneven writing . . .",1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,3940,"['Computer', 'graphic', 'CG', 'animation', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'New', 'Animated', 'Series', '2003', 'unique', 'look', 'particularly', 'when', 'applied', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'practically', 'fly', 'routinely', 'radical', 'moves', 'three', 'dimensional', 'space', 'may', 'take', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'way', 'Spider-Man', 'other', 'CG', 'characters', 'move', 'behave', 'very', 'easy', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'coolness', 'visual', 'presentation', 'Spidey', 'foes', 'are', 'capable', 'wild', 'moves', 'allowing', 'intense', 'action', 'high', 'energy', 'battles.The', 'cartoon', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', '2002', 'left', 'off', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'are', 'attending', 'college', 'Parker', 'studies', 'freelance', 'photographer', 'Dailey', 'Bugle', 'MJ', 'trying', 'further', 'acting', 'career', 'Harry', 'who', 'again', 'nothing', 'original', 'comics', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'recent', 'death', 'father', 'Norman', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Osborn', 'former', 'head', 'Oscorp', 'corporation', 'Spider-Man', 'voiced', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'How', 'Met', 'Your', 'Mother', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'singer', 'Lisa', 'Loeb', 'Harry', 'Ian', 'Ziering.The', 'kinds', 'adventures', 'Spidey', 'involved', 'vary', 'widely', 'original', 'animated', 'stories', 'only', 'slightly', 'character', 'classic', 'comic', 'past', 'emphasis', 'more', 'modern', 'themes', 'high', 'tech', 'aspects', 'quality', 'writing', 'gamut', 'excellent', 'poor', 'high', 'quality', 'animation', 'make', 'episode', 'interesting', 'watch', ""'Sword"", 'Shikata', 'features', 'cool', 'story', 'fantastic', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'female', 'assassin', 'skilled', 'use', 'sword', ""'Law"", 'Jungle', 'slight', 'nod', 'original', 'villain', 'Curt', 'Connors', 'lead', 'becoming', 'Lizard', 'CG', 'version', 'reptilian', 'moves', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'raptor', ""'Spider-Man"", 'Dis-Sabled', ""'"", 'shaky', 'premise', 'Sable', 'female', 'assassin', 'strong', 'personality', 'Returning', 'well', 'female', 'villain', 'thing', 'featured', 'again', ""'Keeping"", 'Secrets', 'where', 'Harry', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'also', 'high', 'tech', 'thief', 'best', 'lot', 'probably', 'two', 'parter', 'Games', 'where', 'pair', 'siblings', 'superior', 'mental', 'abilities', 'use', 'powers', 'convince', 'Spidey', 'try', 'kill', 'Kraven', 'hunter', 'nice', 'see', 'genuine', 'Spidey', 'villain', 'featured', 'least', 'kind', 'frame', 'reference', 'however', 'slight', 'Something', 'largely', 'missing', 'series.The', 'reworking', 'origin', 'Electro', ""'The"", 'Party', 'not', 'work', 'well', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'worse', 'short', 'circuiting', ""'When"", 'Sparks', 'Fly', 'when', 'Electro', 'romance', 'mind', 'miss', ""'Head"", 'Heels', 'nutty', 'tale', 'where', 'Peter', 'lab', 'partner', 'Christina', 'babbling', 'whack', 'job', 'who', 'mind', 'warped', 'accident', 'fixate', 'Spider-Man.The', 'collection', 'truly', 'shines', 'extras', 'department', 'bonus', 'materials', 'include', 'several', 'featurettes', 'onscreen', 'tidbits', 'plethora', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Headed', 'executive', 'producer', 'Morgan', 'Gendel', 'co-executive', 'producer', 'Audu', 'Paden', 'various', 'tracks', 'provide', 'wealth', 'background', 'information', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'general', 'information', 'different', 'aspects', 'production', 'will', 'get', 'understanding', 'things', 'why', 'characters', 'wardrobe', 'not', 'change', 'how', 'are', 'animated', 'how', 'MJ', 'hair', 'moves', 'decisions', 'production', 'team', 'was', 'subject', 'approval', 'Sony', 'MTV', 'who', 'who', 'else', 'getting', 'things', 'done', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'commentaries', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'be', 'fun', 'guy', 'Spidey', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'Marvel', 'comics', 'godfather', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'vocal', 'talents', 'project', 'also', 'several', 'commentaries', 'Lee', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'kid', 'heart', 'great', 'enthusiasm', 'appreciation', 'project', 'co-executive', 'produced', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'renewed', 'second', 'season']",Spider-Man: The New Animated Series
