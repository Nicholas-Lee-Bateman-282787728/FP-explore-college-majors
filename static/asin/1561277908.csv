Mauldin (my favorite of the Crickets) are wonderful.Holly was a genius through and through.  What he would have accomplished had he lived!!The only reason I don't give this documentary a five-star rating is because there were two important elements that were left out of this film.  1.  Norman Petty and his underhanded ways (which are not addressed probably because at the time this documentary was made he was still alive and would sue if he were portrayed accurately).  2.  Maria Elena should have been in this documentary...she married Buddy!!  Why was she excluded, or perhaps it was her decision not to participate due to the enmity between her and the Pettys.  Vi Petty is given special prominence in this but it is a well-known fact that Vi and Norman hated Maria Elena because she stood up to them and made Buddy realize what they were doing.This is a wonderful documentary though!",4,Great documentary...,1221091200,"09 11, 2008",2008,1009,"['great', 'documentary', 'Holly', 'clips', 'Holly', 'are', 'wonderful', 'interviews', 'Jerry', 'Allison', 'Joe', 'B.', 'Mauldin', 'favorite', 'Crickets', 'are', 'wonderful.Holly', 'was', 'genius', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'accomplished', 'had', 'lived', 'only', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'documentary', 'five-star', 'rating', 'were', 'two', 'important', 'elements', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'film', '1', 'Norman', 'Petty', 'underhanded', 'ways', 'are', 'not', 'addressed', 'probably', 'time', 'documentary', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'would', 'sue', 'were', 'portrayed', 'accurately', '2', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'documentary', 'married', 'Buddy', 'Why', 'was', 'excluded', 'perhaps', 'was', 'decision', 'not', 'participate', 'due', 'enmity', 'Pettys', 'Vi', 'Petty', 'given', 'special', 'prominence', 'well-known', 'fact', 'Vi', 'Norman', 'hated', 'Maria', 'Elena', 'stood', 'up', 'made', 'Buddy', 'realize', 'what', 'were', 'doing.This', 'wonderful', 'documentary']",N/A

183100,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,1561277908,Craig Connell,"[1, 1]","Nobody respects and reveres those old American rock pioneers like the British. I share their sentiments. One of those Brits  is Paul McCartney. The former Beatle was not happy with the 1978 movie portrayal of Buddy Holly so he made this documentary. Frankly, I don't see what was so bad about the Gary Busey '78 film about Holly but if McCartney says there were too many flaws in it, I believe him.I'm glad to see the ex-Beatle provide us with more insight and performances of the man from Lubbock, Texas. Of real interest was some footage of Buddy, Elvis and Johnny Cash. This is supposedly the earliest clips ever made of Presley and, man, you can see why the girls went crazy over him.Among the interesting comments in this DVD was by McCartney who commented that fellow Beatle John Lennon never wore his glasses on stage until he saw Holly with his dark-rimmed glasses. Hey, if it was cool enough for Buddy, Lennon said, it's ""good enough for me"" and he wore glasses while performing from then on.That's the one of the many influences Holly had on future music greats, as we hear in this documentary. Fellow Holly band member Sonny Curtis really impressed me with his voice and guitar playing. ""The Crickets,"" Buddy's band, had a lot of talent.Since this tribute was made over 20 years ago, it's interesting to see how young everyone looks, from McCartney to the Everly Brothers and even Keith Richards! The main thing, though, is that we get a real feel for who Buddy Holly was, where he grew up, the atmosphere, the people and managers who surrounded him (including a very pretty ex-girlfriend) and to hear how driven he was to succeed and do the kind of music he wanted to do. It all makes me sad, recalling how we lost of the greatest rock singers/writers of all time at the tender age of 22.To be sure, there are dry spots in this documentary, which is why I didn't give it five stars.  However, I'm thankful to McCartney for this ""labor of love.""

183101,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,1561277908,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[29, 31]","Great music documentary.  Paul McCartney produced this heartfelt tribute as an antidote to the more lurid Gary Busey docudrama that came out the year before.  McCartney goes on the road to re-tell the story of the geeky kid from Lubbock, Texas who helped refine rockabilly into rock'n'roll, and who set the template for the singer-as-songwriter model later taken up by the Beatles.  Holly's story is both astounding and underwhelming -- extensive footage of his shabby hometown helps underscore how humble his background was and how tenuous his success, and -- as Keith Richards points out -- how amazing it was that Holly organized a band capable of elevating themselves out of the C&W world they came from.  It turns out there's very little footage of Holly performing live -- this short film apparently includes all of it -- but it's  fascinating to see his transformation from a nervous kid into a savvy showman, just prior to his untimely death.  In a series of charming, low-key interviews with Holly's old bandmates and contemporaries such as the Everly Brothers, the early world of rock and roll is wonderfully evoked, and the tenuous passing of the torch from a soft pop-destined America to a rock-hungry Britain is convincingly portrayed.  (Plus, check out that all-too-brief guitar break on ""That'll Be The Day""... was Buddy Holly the founding member of the Buzzcocks?!?

I'm still young and wasn't able to witness his death. In some way however, listening to his music and watching these films will always have the deepest affect on me. Paul McCartney's honest tribute to a man that helped pave the way for his own identity was as honorable as a documentary could be.Everything about the film made perfect sense. Gary Busey was extraordinary performing Holly's material, but that's about it. Like the titled stated, this is the real story of one of Rock and Roll's most original artists. It also captures just how far of a genius he was. Holly was a kid from Lubbock, a boy with a dream and a guitar. His influenced spread from Texas to England and with the hearts of Rock and Roll fans all around the world.Buddy Holly's death on February 3rd 1959 marked not only the day the music died, but the end of an era to Rock's Godfathers. The 1960's would prevail and we were left listening to Holly's music performed by various British artists. I always thought of it as kind of the Robin Hood transmission towards music. No matter how far the music takes us, it was the honesty in his songs and the simplicity in the music that, in his own words, will not fade away.",5,Buddy Holly IS GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,1294,"['other', 'way', 'put', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'biggest', 'inspiration', 'life', ""'m"", 'still', 'young', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'witness', 'death', 'way', 'however', 'listening', 'music', 'watching', 'films', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'deepest', 'affect', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'honest', 'tribute', 'man', 'helped', 'pave', 'way', 'own', 'identity', 'was', 'as', 'honorable', 'documentary', 'could', 'be.Everything', 'film', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'performing', 'Holly', 'material', 'titled', 'stated', 'real', 'story', 'one', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'most', 'original', 'artists', 'also', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'genius', 'was', 'Holly', 'was', 'kid', 'Lubbock', 'boy', 'dream', 'guitar', 'influenced', 'spread', 'Texas', 'England', 'hearts', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'fans', 'world.Buddy', 'Holly', 'death', 'February', '3rd', '1959', 'marked', 'not', 'only', 'day', 'music', 'died', 'end', 'era', 'Rock', 'Godfathers', '1960', 'would', 'prevail', 'were', 'left', 'listening', 'Holly', 'music', 'performed', 'various', 'British', 'artists', 'always', 'thought', 'kind', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'transmission', 'towards', 'music', 'matter', 'how', 'far', 'music', 'was', 'honesty', 'songs', 'simplicity', 'music', 'own', 'words', 'will', 'not', 'fade', 'away']",N/A

The documentary manages a pretty balanced view of Buddy's life, though it politely skips over some of the more controversial aspects of his life, such as the somewhat acrimonious breakup of the Crickets near the end of Buddy's life and the complexities created by Buddy marrying a Hispanic female at a time when such a thing was pretty unusual.  The film also ignores or minimizes other aspects of Buddy's life.  For instance, there is some mention of his religious convictions, but no indication of how deep those were.  In fact, Buddy remained a devout Baptist throughout his short life and even tithed to the church (giving 10% of your income to your local church).  At the end of his life he was forming plans to record a collection of religious songs.  Items like this are usually left out of accounts of Buddy's bio.Still, this film has a lot of great footage and some wonderful interviews with a lot of great people, not just people who knew and performed with Buddy, but some who were deeply influenced by him, like Keith Richards.  McCartney is a solid if not terribly penetrating interviewer (his position in the rock world would prevent his asking any uncomfortable questions, such as probing for details about the reputed fight between Buddy and a bandmate before appearing on Ed Sullivan).The one thing that I've always regretted was just how little quality film footage there is of Buddy Holly performing.  We've a lot a photographs and a satisfying number of studio recordings, but few recordings of Buddy performing live.  Even one of the sequences found in this film shows Buddy lip synching rather than performing live.  The film does include a great deal of rather raw footage, where we get visuals of Holly performing with either inadequate or no audio.There may someday be a better documentary film about Buddy Holly, but it is unlikely that we will ever see one with as much first-rate original interview footage.  And no film is likely to do a better job of documenting just how central Buddy Holly was to the development of rock music in the early sixties, when bands like the Beatles, following the example of Holly, started writing their own songs instead of doing covers of those written by others.  It has often been stated that of all the deaths of performers in the history of music in the rock era, it was Holly's that most impoverished our culture.  Only 22 at the time of his death, Holly could well have taken our music in completely new directions.  We'll never know what he might have done, but what he actually accomplished was extraordinary.",5,A splendid collection of contemporary interviews and vintage photos and film,1248048000,"07 20, 2009",2009,3195,"['Paul', 'McCartney', 'beginning', 'fine', 'documentary', 'was', 'dissatisfied', 'version', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'story', 'told', 'movie', 'name', 'hoped', 'film', 'tell', 'THE', 'REAL', 'BUDDY', 'HOLLY', 'STORY', 'therefore', 'set', 'out', 'interview', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'friends', 'family', 'fellow', 'musicians', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'have', 'read', 'John', 'Goldrosen', 'highly', 'regarded', 'biography', 'THE', 'BUDDY', 'HOLLY', 'STORY', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'here', 'unfamiliar', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'film', 'footage', 'very', 'raw', 'can', 'course', 'never', 'be', 'contained', 'book', 'documentary', 'pretty', 'balanced', 'view', 'Buddy', 'life', 'politely', 'more', 'controversial', 'aspects', 'life', 'such', 'somewhat', 'acrimonious', 'breakup', 'Crickets', 'end', 'Buddy', 'life', 'complexities', 'created', 'Buddy', 'marrying', 'Hispanic', 'female', 'time', 'when', 'thing', 'was', 'pretty', 'unusual', 'film', 'also', 'other', 'aspects', 'Buddy', 'life', 'instance', 'mention', 'religious', 'convictions', 'indication', 'how', 'deep', 'were', 'fact', 'Buddy', 'remained', 'devout', 'Baptist', 'short', 'life', 'even', 'tithed', 'church', 'giving', '10', '%', 'income', 'local', 'church', 'end', 'life', 'was', 'forming', 'plans', 'record', 'collection', 'religious', 'songs', 'are', 'usually', 'left', 'out', 'accounts', 'Buddy', 'bio.Still', 'film', 'lot', 'great', 'footage', 'wonderful', 'interviews', 'lot', 'great', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'performed', 'Buddy', 'who', 'were', 'deeply', 'influenced', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'McCartney', 'solid', 'not', 'terribly', 'penetrating', 'interviewer', 'position', 'rock', 'world', 'would', 'prevent', 'asking', 'uncomfortable', 'questions', 'such', 'probing', 'details', 'reputed', 'fight', 'Buddy', 'bandmate', 'appearing', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', '.The', 'one', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'always', 'regretted', 'was', 'just', 'how', 'little', 'quality', 'film', 'footage', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'performing', ""'ve"", 'lot', 'photographs', 'satisfying', 'number', 'studio', 'recordings', 'few', 'recordings', 'Buddy', 'performing', 'live', 'Even', 'one', 'sequences', 'found', 'film', 'Buddy', 'lip', 'synching', 'rather', 'performing', 'live', 'film', 'include', 'great', 'deal', 'rather', 'raw', 'footage', 'where', 'get', 'visuals', 'Holly', 'performing', 'inadequate', 'audio.There', 'may', 'someday', 'be', 'better', 'documentary', 'film', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'unlikely', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'one', 'as', 'much', 'first-rate', 'original', 'interview', 'footage', 'film', 'likely', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'documenting', 'just', 'how', 'central', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'was', 'development', 'rock', 'music', 'early', 'sixties', 'when', 'bands', 'Beatles', 'following', 'example', 'Holly', 'started', 'writing', 'own', 'songs', 'instead', 'doing', 'covers', 'written', 'others', 'often', 'been', 'stated', 'deaths', 'performers', 'history', 'music', 'rock', 'era', 'was', 'Holly', 'most', 'impoverished', 'culture', 'Only', '22', 'time', 'death', 'Holly', 'could', 'well', 'have', 'taken', 'music', 'completely', 'new', 'directions', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'what', 'actually', 'accomplished', 'was', 'extraordinary']",N/A

Since I live only two hours away from both towns, I have toured the Petty Studios twice in Clovis, and seen the home in which Buddy was married and the church from which he was buried, and his grave, all in Lubbock. I've met two men who performed backup vocals on some of the hits (The Crickets did not sing on the records) and visited the Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock, a long-overdue tribute to the man who made Lubbock famous, literally, around the world. I was a kid in New Jersey when I bought my first Buddy Holly single, and he was still alive, and one of the first facts I ever learned about him was that he lived in Lubbock and recorded in Clovis. Fifteen years after Buddy's death, to my surprise, I ended up living only about 100 miles from both towns. This DVD is well worth the cost, and it may go out of print, so don't hesitate to add it to your Holly collection.
