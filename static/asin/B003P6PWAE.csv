I like the relationship between Elisabeth and Keith and how she's attracted to him for his compassion of her ""misunderstood"" mother. Christopher Lambert is funny-after he becomes a vampire; he's a dud before. I also love the shaking crosses, big and small...If you are kind to vampire movies you might enjoy it.",3,I've seen worse!,1312934400,"08 10, 2011",2011,362,"['was', 'not', 'great', 'vampire', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'relationship', 'Elisabeth', 'Keith', 'how', 'attracted', 'compassion', 'misunderstood', 'mother', 'Christopher', 'Lambert', 'funny-after', 'vampire', 'dud', 'also', 'love', 'shaking', 'crosses', 'big', 'small', 'are', 'kind', 'vampire', 'movies', 'might', 'enjoy']",Metamorphosis
1356593,A1D2LB4Z5RMO4M,B003P6PWAE,Amanda Pike,"[5, 6]","This is one of the worst vampire films I have ever seen.  The dialogue was so cheesy I practically winced. Some of it didn't make sense.  WHY did Christopher Lambert's character (who was British) call Elizabeth Bathory's daughter a tourist while they were IN Hungary?  WHY are people able to bleed IN purgatory?  What was with the vampire hunter?The main character is what many call a Gary Stu.  A Gary Stu is the male equivalent of the Mary Sue, a very flat, two dimensional protagonist designed to be an ideal that the audience members are supposed to relate to. He's the sort of character that is frowned upon in role playing games for being uncreative and contrived.The more you think about it, the less sense the film made and it over explained simple things like the term clinically dead.  This was just bad.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  This felt like a Syfy original movie, that's how bad it was.  I can't even put into words how much I disliked this movie.  On the list of bad vampire movies this goes up there with the Twilight films, Dracula 3000, Queen of the damned and the Fright Night remake, just bad.If you want an interesting vampire romance just go watch Bram Stoker's Dracula. This was awful.The plot of Metamorphosis:  Okay, so it begins with the sad, misunderstood ...Elizabeth Bathory (yes, the woman who bathed in virgin blood) as her daughter (also named Elizabeth) is ripped from her arms.  He comes off as a cheesy villain. ""Mwahaha!  You'll never see your child again!  Mwaaha!"" And flings her over a horse (obviously a doll at this point because her head bobs up and down way too fast as they gallop away).  Apparently the daughter grew up, cursed God for what became of her family and became a vampire.Cut to modern day Hungary.  British Christopher Lambert (yes, the Highlander.  I have trouble buying that too) shows up at his brother's funeral where he tries to stop a vampire hunter from staking his brother.  Apparently Chris is playing the last of his family.  The family descended from the man who separated Elizabeth Bathory from her daughter. The 'evil family' was cursed to each become vampires at the time of their death. And the daughter has been killing them off one by one.  That's right.  Our vampire hero (yes, she's supposed to be the good guy) has been killing men, women and children just because of who one of their ancestors were!  Christopher Lambert drives off and has a car crash and dies.A a group of American tourists are driving through the Hungarian countryside (which suddenly has a LOT more desert than Hungary really should... yet the film claims to have been filmed on location...) They pick up the strangely dressed Elizabeth and then meet with some monks who tell them that life has three phases.  Life, purgatory, and what comes after.  But in Purgatory your soul can be utterly destroyed and is very dangerous.  Why the monks tell them this... exposition for later, of course!The leader of these tourists is the guy who also played Mathew in Dresden Files (the Hellion from the episode Rules of Engagement).  I'll call the character Gary Stu from this point out.  He's flat, two dimensional and very obviously there to be the hero / love interest.  He's poorly developed.He sympathizes with poor, misunderstood Elizabeth Bathory.  'She just needed help'  And worst of all the cruel fiend (Lambert's character's ancestor) ripped her daughter from her arms.  He also memorized a Hungarian poem even though he doesn't speak the language just because it ""sounded beautiful"" so Elizabeth (who is familiar with the poem and loves it too) translates.  I'm sorry but WHO memorizes a poem because it ""Sounds beautiful"" if you don't understand the language!?The other passengers are annoying stereotypes including one shallow bimbo in a half-cut hoody.Eventually all the heroes end up in a castle where Christopher Lambert is dressed in period clothes.  Elizabeth gloats about having killed his entire family while he gives off cheesy one liners and lines that sound like they directly rip off Dracula.  When he's not paraphrasing Dracula he's delivering these very, very cheesy and over used one liners that sound like they belong in a comic book.  They were so bad I wanted to wince.  At one point he shouts at her ""I will not be defeated by a tourist!""  Umm... She's not a tourist.  You are.  You're British, SHE is Hungarian, you are IN Hungary.  Unless he means the American boy but he was saying it to Elizabeth while fighting her.  It does not make sense.  He even, at one point, gives the over used line about The Bible being the world's greatest Best selling fiction.All the while Elizabeth keeps ""mysteriously"" telling Gary Stu that he needs to go to the light.  One of his friends is caught in a cartoonish loop of running down a flight of stairs, through a door and then down the same flight of stairs again and again and again, apparently not noticing it's the same stairs over and over and over again!Finally Christopher Lambert and all his cheesy one liners are defeated but both Elizabeth and Gary Stu are badly wounded.  Again she pleads with him to go to the light (and sure enough there's a glowing vortex of light) but instead he chooses to stay with her because he lubs her (Yes, I said lub instead of love because it's just that cheesy).  She says 'Forgive me' and then bites him.Gary Stu wakes up, impaled on a stake-like shaft of broken wood sticking out of the ground.  Apparently all his travel companions died in a horrible car crash.  He pulls himself off the stake and staggers to an old shack and as he does we see that the back of his jacket doesn't even have a hole in it even though he was impaled!  At the shack Elizabeth is waiting and she tells him that in the real world only four minutes passed while it seemed like hours in purgatory and if he didn't go to the light in time his brain cells would have died for he was only clinically dead (which she also has to explain to the audience because apparently we're morons...)  Vampires apparently could pass from the real world to purgatory at will since they are of both the living world and the dead but if you're killed in purgatory the soul is destroyed (contradicting just about every religious view of purgatory and the soul, ever).  She informs Gary Stu that vampirism isn't so bad and they can even go in the sun, the whole burning in the sun thing is only in the movies.  This part doesn't bother me because in Dracula they could go in the sun too.Well, Gary Stu eventually forgives her for making him a vampire since she did it out of lub.  They make out on the side of the road and who should be driving by but the vampire hunter from Christopher Lambert's brother's funeral!  He sees them (or rather doesn't see them) in his rear view mirror and pulls over his pick up truck.  Yes, the vampire hunter has a pickup truck.  He climbs out and takes two stakes and a hammer from his trunk (which is loaded with stakes, crosses and garlic) and he gets back in the front seat with the stakes and hammer next to him.  The final scene is our vampire lovers hitchhinking and getting into the back of the pickup truck with the vampire hunter, apparently not noticing the stakes and hammers right next to him or the smell of garlic from the back!Then the credits rolled and my head hurt...",1,WHY did I watch this?!,1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,7329,"['one', 'worst', 'vampire', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen',

1356595,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B003P6PWAE,Compay,"[3, 3]","Metamorphosis is about what you would expect from most straight-to-DVD horror flicks. The film follows the story of a young American writer researching a centuries-old legend in Europe, and the mysterious stranger that his friends pick up along the way.Pros: The film was shot primarily in Hungary, and the setting is amazing. Terrific forest and mountain shots, and scenes shot in real castles and monasteries add to the authentic vibe of the film. The cast features a wide variety of experienced Hungarian actors, and a mix of others from Germany, America and the UK. While not particularly talented, the amazingly beautiful Romanian actress Irena Hoffman makes a welcome addition as the mysterious woman the Americans encounter.Cons: Low production value, weak CGI effects, and sub-par writing. Kudos to director Jen&ouml; Hodi (who makes a cameo) for not wanting to make a ""typical"" vampire flick, but Metamorphosis comes off like a bad soap opera. The film's focus is that vampires have feelings too, but it's displayed through overdramatic dialogue. Christopher Lambert of Highlander fame plays a vampire that is so chatty that it becomes annoying after a while. The jokes in the film are dry, and there's an awful lot of overracting.There's very little blood in the film, and nuances like Deja Vu moments are never really explained. There's a twist by the film's conclusion, but even that doesn't fully answer the viewer's questions about the story.The DVD extras include a featurette on the making of the film, with interviews of the main cast. There is also a video for ""Route 66"", by Hungarian rapper D&ouml;gl&eacute;gy (Zolee Ganxsta) who appears in the film as Igor the Russian traveler.The film had some interesting elements that made it different from other horror movies, but overall I just wasn't impressed with this vampire romance film.

1356596,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B003P6PWAE,CriticNic,"[0, 1]","When three friends, Keith, J.J., and Kim travel to Hungary they wind up finding themselves traveling through much more than beautiful medieval scenery and architecture. Keith's objective is to research Elizabeth Bathory, or the Blood Countess, so he can write a book on her, while his friends are tagging along for the journey.On their way to a monastery the trio runs into a lone beautiful woman named Elizabeth (no coincidence), played by Irena A. Hoffman. Elizabeth is as fascinated and familiar with the history of the Countess as Keith is, and naturally the two begin to fall for each other. Things take a darker turn though as the group arrives to the monastery grounds to find themselves in the midst of some very strange occurrences.Christopher Lambert plays Constantine, whom I can't elaborate much on without giving anything away. Lambert is the most known actor in the film and definitely fits his role. The rest of the cast is a mixed bag. Hoffman and Sevier are two young actors I'm looking forward to see more of as they had great chemistry and were the stand outs from the rest of the relatively unknown cast.From the movie cover art we already know this is a vampire movie. There are vampires in this movie, however there's nothing particularly outstanding and different about them. With so many vampire movies popping up these days, it would be nice to see someone take some risks with the mythical creatures.The movie is ultimately an entertaining supernatural love story. It had a nice twist at the end which I really appreciated. The dialog was decent and the scenery, mostly shot in Hungary, was breathtaking. The film has one fatal flaw though: the CGI effects and some of the action sequences were awful. This to me was too big to ignore. In lower budget pictures, I set reasonable standards, however I just can't get past bad animation.Overall I had fun with this one. The supernatural twist, the gorgeous leading lady, the astounding scenery, and the intriguing legend of the Countess made me keep watching. It has its flaws and may not stand out from other vampire movies, but it had some nice ideas and was played out well.Source: criticnic.com 21-July-2010Disclosure: Film sent by MTI Home Video",3,"Decent vampire flick, but doesn't stand out",1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,2223,"['When', 'three', 'friends', 'Keith', 'J.J.', 'Kim', 'travel', 'Hungary', 'wind', 'up', 'finding', 'traveling', 'much', 'more', 'beautiful', 'medieval', 'scenery', 'architecture', 'Keith', 'objective', 'research', 'Elizabeth', 'Bathory', 'Blood', 'Countess', 'can', 'write', 'book', 'friends', 'are', 'tagging', 'journey.On', 'way', 'monastery', 'trio', 'lone', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'named', 'Elizabeth', 'coincidence', 'played', 'Irena', 'A.', 'Hoffman', 'Elizabeth', 'as', 'fascinated', 'familiar', 'history', 'Countess', 'Keith', 'naturally', 'two', 'begin', 'fall', 'other', 'Things', 'take', 'darker', 'turn', 'group', 'monastery', 'find', 'midst', 'very', 'strange', 'occurrences.Christopher', 'Lambert', 'Constantine', 'whom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'elaborate', 'much', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'Lambert', 'most', 'known', 'actor', 'film', 'definitely', 'role', 'rest', 'cast', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Hoffman', 'Sevier', 'are', 'two', 'young', 'actors', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'see', 'more', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'were', 'stand', 'rest', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'cast.From', 'movie', 'cover', 'art', 'already', 'know', 'vampire', 'movie', 'are', 'vampires', 'movie', 'however', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'different', 'so', 'many', 'vampire', 'movies', 'popping', 'up', 'days', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'someone', 'take', 'risks', 'mythical', 'creatures.The', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'entertaining', 'supernatural', 'love', 'story', 'had', 'nice', 'twist', 'end', 'really', 'appreciated', 'dialog', 'was', 'decent', 'scenery', 'mostly', 'shot', 'Hungary', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'film', 'one', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'CGI', 'effects', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'awful', 'was', 'too', 'big', 'ignore', 'lower', 'budget', 'pictures', 'set', 'reasonable', 'standards', 'however', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'bad', 'animation.Overall', 'had', 'fun', 'one', 'supernatural', 'twist', 'gorgeous', 'leading', 'lady', 'astounding', 'scenery', 'intriguing', 'legend', 'Countess', 'made', 'keep', 'watching', 'flaws', 'may', 'not', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'vampire', 'movies', 'had', 'nice', 'ideas', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'well.Source', 'criticnic.com', '21-July-2010Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', 'MTI', 'Home', 'Video']",Metamorphosis

Though born on Long Island, he moved to Switzerland at the age of 2. His first few films were French, and ""Greystoke"" (1984) was his first English film. He made a number of other English speaking films (e.g., ""The Sicilian"" in 1987, ""Mortal Combat"" in 1995) but most of his subsequent work has been foreign, primarily French. He won the Cesar Award (French Oscar) in 1986 for ""Subway"", a Luc Besson film.

Based on the Elizibeth Bathory legend it takes place in Hungary. This is NOT your ordinary Vampire movie, but has a twilight zone feel to it. The lead Vamp is played hy Irena A. Hoffman (whom I'd never heard of), and she is HOT !! I'm talking about a 10 even as the undead. Christopher Lambert (from the Highlander movies) plays a Thurzo whom were bitter rivals of the Bathory's. I absolutely love this movie, and all of the plot lines which differentiate it from other Vampire movies !! If you do not like Irena, or how this movie plays out you're not a true horror fan !!

Not only does it bring up vampirism but also brings up the concepts of Purgatory, after life, and eternal love.  Christopher Lambert plays the descendant of a family which tortured and walled up the Blood Countess and who had a curse placed upon them lasting  throughout the ages.  Enter a young historian and his two school friends who happen to meet the daughter of the Countess who is also a vampire and you have the gist of the plot.  Great scenery and fast moving set pieces keep everything moving rapidly to its flawed climax.  Irena A Hoffman steals the show as the Countess where she balances innocence and sex goddess at a blink of an eye.
