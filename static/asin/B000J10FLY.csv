It was a popular book my library teacher in 5th grade used to read to me all the time, along with my reading teachers.  The class loved it as well.The movie takes everything we loved about the book and makes it just as gross and disgusting as the story!  In the movie, a little boy eats worms in very creative ways.  He fries them, and throughout the story, the little boy (who is forced to eat 10 worms by a school bully) learns to accept them.  At first, the boy is naturally unwilling to eat them, because they're WORMS and that would be extremely gross!  But he eventually comes around and finds they aren't quite as bad as he originally thought.  The school bully was, of course, just as mean as you'd expect someone of that age to be.It was a very funny and original story, I thought.

1024047,AQIO9QHHPFFET,B000J10FLY,Brendan M. Howard,"[10, 10]","Screenwriter-director Bob Dolman lets his cast be themselves, and that's what makes How to Eat Fried Worms delicious fun for adults and children. Authentic and energetic performances from the pre-teen stars make for captivating watching, as new kid Billy (Benward) gets wrangled into a bet to eat 10 worms in a day by local bully Joe (Hicks). What he doesn't know is Joe's gang is concocting horrible ways to cook those worms. Liver juice and blended broccoli top the ingredients.Mixed in with this groovy gag-worthy plot hook are great strands of parents trying to help kids adjust to new situations, girls trying to be friends with gross boys, siblings learning to like each other, and the redemption of bullies who really aren't that bad. Benward does a great job of conveying the terror of a new school and trying to find new friends, while such enemies-turned-friend as the spastic Twitch, the dancing Adam Simms and the theatrical chef Benjy will have all ages in stiches. Helping these on-screen bursts of energy is a wacky score by Devo leader Mark Mothersbaugh.Kids' movies that don't dumb down the pain of loneliness, bullying and growing up always deserve praise, and Dolman's concocted a winner out of the cute 1953 source material.DVD Extras: The extras are all kid-friendly and get my adult-approved stamp. A chef shows how he cooks up ""worms"" for consumption by Benward (cheesecake taste helps). A blooper reel, deleted scenes and a promotional making-of featurette are cute and fast-paced.

1024052,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000J10FLY,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","It's hard to call a film cute when the story revolves around a kid eating worms in a variety of ways, but certainly there's a lot to this film once you look beyond the whole yuck factor.  It actually succeeds in turning worm-eating into a metaphor that resonates with meaning for adults as well as children, for we all have to eat a worm or two every so often (again, metaphorically) as part of life.  It's all about how we project ourselves, and how honest we are to ourselves and those around us - especially those we really want to impress.  What I'm trying to say is How to Eat Fried Worms is actually a wholesome film with a number of important life lessons to impart to viewers.It's never easy being the new kid in school, largely because of that one bully who makes it his mission to harass and establish his dominance over everyone - especially newbies.  For Billy (Luke Benward), it starts with a major glaring session upon arrival and quickly builds up to a thermos filled not with a delicious Kool-Aid type drink but a whole gob of nasty, disgusting worms, all of it courtesy of Joe (Adam Hicks), who sits atop the classmate food chain.  Billy makes the spontaneous decision to play it cool, claiming that he eats worms all the time, then closes with a perfect toss of one worm into Joe's face.  Yes, it looks like a small triumph for the little guy over the big bad bully, but the resulting taunts of ""Worm boy"" soon compel Billy to make the fatal mistake of ""the bet.""  Before he knows what he's doing, he's bet Joe that he can eat ten worms on Saturday, with the loser having to come to school with a bucket load of worms in his pants.As Billy's new friend Erika (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) often says, boys are just weird.  Joe's gang goes all out to come up with some of the most disgusting fried worm delicacies they can imagine (don't ask me why they think it's harder to eat a fried worm than a squishy live one).  The levers of power shift as Billy manages to stay in the game, everyone seems to learn something about himself along the way, and the outcome of the bet doesn't seem all that important when all is said and done.  Don't judge anyone too quickly stands among this film's various lessons to all of us, but it will obviously play best to boys and girls who can personally relate to the vagaries of playground dominance that give rise to such silly yet all-important contests as Billy's worm-eating challenge.",4,Don't try this at home,1175817600,"04 6, 2007",2007,2435,"['hard', 'call', 'film', 'cute', 'when', 'story', 'around', 'kid', 'eating', 'worms', 'variety', 'ways', 'certainly', 'lot', 'film', 'once', 'look', 'whole', 'yuck', 'factor', 'actually', 'turning', 'worm-eating', 'metaphor', 'meaning', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'have', 'eat', 'worm', 'two', 'so', 'often', 'again', 'metaphorically', 'part', 'life', 'how', 'project', 'how', 'honest', 'are', 'ourselves', 'especially', 'really', 'want', 'impress', 'What', ""'m"", 'trying', 'say', 'How', 'Eat', 'Fried', 'Worms', 'actually', 'wholesome', 'film', 'number', 'important', 'life', 'lessons', 'impart', 'viewers.It', 'never', 'easy', 'being', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'largely', 'one', 'bully', 'who', 'mission', 'harass', 'establish', 'dominance', 'everyone', 'especially', 'newbies', 'Billy', 'Luke', 'Benward', 'major', 'glaring', 'session', 'arrival', 'quickly', 'builds', 'up', 'thermos', 'filled', 'not', 'delicious', 'Kool-Aid', 'type', 'drink', 'whole', 'gob', 'nasty', 'disgusting', 'worms', 'courtesy', 'Joe', 'Adam', 'Hicks', 'who', 'atop', 'classmate', 'food', 'chain', 'Billy', 'spontaneous', 'decision', 'play', 'cool', 'claiming', 'time', 'then', 'perfect', 'toss', 'one', 'worm', 'Joe', 'face', 'Yes', 'small', 'triumph', 'little', 'guy', 'big', 'bad', 'bully', 'resulting', 'taunts', 'Worm', 'boy', 'soon', 'compel', 'Billy', 'make', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'bet', 'what', 'doing', 'bet', 'Joe', 'can', 'eat', 'ten', 'worms', 'Saturday', 'loser', 'having', 'come', 'school', 'bucket', 'load', 'worms', 'pants.As', 'Billy', 'new', 'friend', 'Erika', 'Hallie', 'Kate', 'Eisenberg', 'often', 'boys', 'are', 'just', 'weird', 'Joe', 'gang', 'come', 'up', 'most', 'disgusting', 'fried', 'worm', 'delicacies', 'can', 'imagine', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'think', 'harder', 'eat', 'fried', 'worm', 'squishy', 'live', 'one', 'levers', 'power', 'shift', 'Billy', 'stay', 'game', 'everyone', 'learn', 'something', 'way', 'outcome', 'bet', ""n't"", 'seem', 'important', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'Do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'anyone', 'too', 'quickly', 'film', 'various', 'lessons', 'will', 'obviously', 'play', 'best', 'boys', 'girls', 'who', 'can', 'personally', 'relate', 'vagaries', 'playground', 'dominance', 'give', 'rise', 'such', 'silly', 'yet', 'all-important', 'contests', 'Billy', 'worm-eating', 'challenge']",N/A

Reinstein ""marindavid""","[0, 0]","In an effort to balance the many dramas, romantic comedies and thrillers available on DVD with let's-really-laugh comedy, I have tried to order a comedy every so often. This isn't easy since 1) I am not particularly easy to please when it comes to comedic films and 2) there seem to be far fewer good comedies than there are good films in the other genres. Therefore, I take more chances. In doing so, one of the things I have learned is that movies for kids can be a lot of fun - for adults. Having just finished watching this one, I am pleased to be able to add it to a relatively short list of kid movies that made me laugh at least a few times - partly because, like all men, there is a little boy still lurking in the not-so-very-deep recesses of my being, and partly because this film reminds me that certain themes are universal - and that films made for kids are about many of the same things that films made for adults are about. They are just told differently.In this case, the core theme is about bullies, being new in town and doing what is hard to do - because it is both necessary and right. Sound familiar? Apart from the four or five adult characters - all played as being completely useless, clueless and ineffectual in their respective 'jobs,' the cast is entirely made up of kids who appear to be in the range of 9-12 years old. The adults, of course, have NO idea what is really going on and the bully, as is the case with every good Morality Play written since the dark ages, gets his just deserts. Not, however, with true suffering and pain - but with humor and a resolution that includes an friendship that seems highly improbable for most of the film.There is a heroine - one of the kids and the only girl amongst the principal players.To tell more about the plot would be to destroy the story for potential viewers.Suffice it to say that this is a film you can watch with your own kids or grandkids (ages 8 and up I would think would be OK) - and they will appreciate the humor at their own level - and you, as adults, will have a good time watching both the film and the child's enjoyment of it.It may help to take a look at a currently popular paperback about things adults commonly tend to regard as disgusting (like boogers, for example) but which kids find profoundly interesting and worthwhile! When you see it on a bookstore shelf, you'll recognize it immediately.Have some fun with your young kids (or grandkids), rent or buy this one, put on some popcorn and enjoy a family night at home with a movie with a little something for everyone - both kids and you adults who can recall having ever been one!",3,A Particulary Gaggable Telling Of An Old Story!,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,2635,"['effort', 'balance', 'many', 'dramas', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'thrillers', 'available', 'DVD', ""let's-really-laugh"", 'comedy', 'have', 'tried', 'order', 'comedy', 'so', 'often', ""n't"", 'easy', '1', 'am', 'not', 'particularly', 'easy', 'please', 'when', 'comedic', 'films', '2', 'there', 'seem', 'be', 'far', 'fewer', 'good', 'comedies', 'are', 'good', 'films', 'other', 'genres', 'Therefore', 'take', 'more', 'chances', 'doing', 'so', 'one', 'things', 'have', 'learned', 'movies', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'adults', 'Having', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'one', 'am', 'pleased', 'be', 'able', 'add', 'relatively', 'short', 'list', 'kid', 'movies', 'made', 'laugh', 'least', 'few', 'times', 'partly', 'men', 'little', 'boy', 'still', 'lurking', 'not-so-very-deep', 'recesses', 'being', 'partly', 'film', 'certain', 'themes', 'are', 'universal', 'films', 'made', 'kids', 'are', 'many', 'same', 'things', 'films', 'made', 'adults', 'are', 'are', 'just', 'told', 'differently.In', 'case', 'core', 'theme', 'bullies', 'being', 'new', 'town', 'doing', 'what', 'hard', 'do', 'necessary', 'right', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Apart', 'four', 'five', 'adult', 'characters', 'played', 'being', 'completely', 'useless', 'clueless', 'ineffectual', 'respective', ""'jobs"", 'cast', 'entirely', 'made', 'kids', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'range', '9-12', 'years', 'old', 'adults', 'course', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'bully', 'case', 'good', 'Morality', 'Play', 'written', 'dark', 'ages', 'just', 'deserts', 'Not', 'however', 'true', 'suffering', 'pain', 'humor', 'resolution', 'friendship', 'highly', 'improbable', 'most', 'film.There', 'heroine', 'one', 'kids', 'only', 'girl', 'amongst', 'principal', 'players.To', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'destroy', 'story', 'potential', 'viewers.Suffice', 'say', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'own', 'kids', 'grandkids', 'ages', '8', 'up', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'OK', 'will', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'own', 'level', 'adults', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'film', 'child', 'enjoyment', 'it.It', 'may', 'help', 'take', 'look', 'currently', 'popular', 'paperback', 'things', 'adults', 'commonly', 'tend', 'regard', 'disgusting', 'boogers', 'example', 'kids', 'find', 'profoundly', 'interesting', 'worthwhile', 'When', 'see', 'bookstore', 'shelf', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'immediately.Have', 'fun', 'young', 'kids', 'grandkids', 'rent', 'buy', 'one', 'put', 'popcorn', 'enjoy', 'family', 'night', 'home', 'movie', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', 'kids', 'adults', 'who', 'can', 'recall', 'having', 'ever', 'been', 'one']",N/A

Following a run in with the school bully, Billy accepts a dare to eat ten worms in a single day. The rest of the film is simply low-grade gross-out humour that would appeal immensely to 7 year olds, and those suffering from arrested development.The first half hour (up until the worm eating begins) is slow and not all that funny, I could imagine many children losing interest (I almost gave up), but once the worm eating begins the film picks up a lot. Even though I am about 20 years older than the target audience for this film (I'm 27), I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat to see if Billy would eat all of the worms. Well, not really, but I was still interested in knowing what would happen next and how the film would end. The writer and director did manage to get as much suspense into the film as was possible and for that I applaud them.My biggest problem with the film was the one token female character, Erika. The sole purpose of this character seems to be to act as a mother to the young male characters in the film and not to participate in any of the fun, simply because she is a girl. Speaking as a female, I was insulted and I don't think this is a good message to send to young girls or young boys. I don't think it would have bothered me if she had been excluded entirely from the film, I can accept that it is realistic that young boys might not want to play with girls, but if girls and boys are being shown playing together, I don't think it is a nice to send the message that girls aren't as fun as boys. You may be thinking that I'm saying this just because I'm an adult, but this was also how I felt when I was a child.This film is not a bad way to spend a rainy afternoon, but you are probably better off renting it rather than buying it.

It was fairly low-budget, which meant that the acting had to carry the water.  I think these young actors did very well in their roles.  It was refreshing to see kids playing outside all over town instead of being glued to some type of screen.  The bullies were not physically abusive (or even cruel hearted) as in so many of these *new kid in town* themes.  The parents were not complete idiots either, which was refreshing.  James Rebhorn as principal Boilerhead ripped his role off from James Tolkan, who played the principal in Back To The Future.Bottom line, my 14 and 16 year-olds liked this movie, the fetching Mrs. Brew and I thought is was just OK.

Yes, I'm serious.In a case of true chip-off-the-old-block-dom, my daughter has started writing movie reviews for her middle school paper, so it's up to me to start taking her to all the movies her mother and stepmother have no desire (and rightly, so, many times) to see. At the top of the list was How to Eat Fried Worms. Now, Thomas Rockwell was one of my favorite authors in middle school, both for this wonderful novel and for his much more obscure (and now long out of print) and even more brilliant The Portmanteau Book. Given that, and the decidedly lukewarm reviews to be had, I went into this fearing the worst. And I must say, I didn't get it. I grant you, this movie could have been miles better, especially had it been more faithful to the book. But, you know, for a dumbed-down brought-up-to-date movie based on a kids' book, it's not half bad.Billy (Because of Winn-Dixie's Luke Benward) is the new kid at school, and as such is immediately picked on by the local team of bullies, headed up by Joe (The Shaggy Dog's Adam Hicks). Really, all you need to know is that the two of them end up making a bet that Billy can't eat ten worms in the space of a day. There's also a kinda-sorta romantic subplot between Billy and Erika (Hallie Kate Eisenberg, the Pepsi girl), who gets roped into watching Billy's little brother during the contest, but it gets relegated to the back burner pretty quick.I think a lot of the negative reaction to the movie is coming simply because it's an adaptation of a classic kids' book, and not a really great one. And there's a case to be made that if you're going to adapt a great book, you need to turn it into a great movie. I also think that argument is pure bunk. A book and a movie are two entirely separate things, and sometimes you just have to look at them as such. (Consider the 1974 Tobe Hooper adaptation of 'Salem's Lot.) If this weren't an adaptation of Thomas Rockwell's novel, what would we be saying about it? That it plays into the gross-factor? (Better with worms than with the infantile potty humor of The Ant Bully.) That the motivations of its characters are shallow and silly? (Compared to Cars, these characters are as well-drawn as any major character in War and Peace.) That it's episodic and overly simplistic? (Three words: Over the Hedge.)Comparatively, this is one of the best kids' movies we've seen this year, though I'm certainly willing to concede that it's just been an awful year for kids' movies. It does have just about everything it needs to attract the pre-teen set, though you might want to consider whether you want your eight-year-old running around yelling ""sphincter!"" all day afterwards. ** ",3,"Better than I expected, not as good as I hoped.",1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,2818,"['How', 'Eat', 'Fried', 'Worms', 'Bob', 'Dolman', '2006', 'Here', 'daily', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'factoid', 'How', 'Eat', 'Fried', 'Worms', 'banned', 'Malaysia', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'serious.In', 'case', 'true', 'chip-off-the-old-block-dom', 'daughter', 'started', 'writing', 'movie', 'reviews', 'middle', 'school', 'paper', 'up', 'start', 'taking', 'movies', 'mother', 'stepmother', 'have', 'desire', 'rightly', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'see', 'top', 'list', 'was', 'How', 'Eat', 'Fried', 'Worms', 'Now', 'Thomas', 'Rockwell', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', 'middle', 'school', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'much', 'more', 'obscure', 'now', 'long', 'print', 'even', 'more', 'brilliant', 'Portmanteau', 'Book', 'Given', 'decidedly', 'lukewarm', 'reviews', 'be', 'had', 'went', 'fearing', 'worst', 'must', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'grant', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'miles', 'better', 'especially', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'faithful', 'book', 'know', 'dumbed-down', 'brought-up-to-date', 'movie', 'based', 'kids', 'book', 'not', 'half', 'bad.Billy', 'Winn-Dixie', 'Luke', 'Benward', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'such', 'immediately', 'picked', 'local', 'team', 'bullies', 'headed', 'up', 'Joe', 'Shaggy', 'Dog', 'Adam', 'Hicks', 'Really', 'need', 'know', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'bet', 'Billy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'eat', 'ten', 'worms', 'space', 'day', 'also', 'kinda-sorta', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'Billy', 'Erika', 'Hallie', 'Kate', 'Eisenberg', 'Pepsi', 'girl', 'who', 'roped', 'watching', 'Billy', 'little', 'brother', 'contest', 'relegated', 'back', 'burner', 'pretty', 'quick.I', 'think', 'lot', 'negative', 'reaction', 'movie', 'coming', 'simply', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'kids', 'book', 'not', 'really', 'great', 'one', 'case', 'be', 'made', ""'re"", 'going', 'adapt', 'great', 'book', 'need', 'turn', 'great', 'movie', 'also', 'think', 'argument', 'pure', 'bunk', 'book', 'movie', 'are', 'two', 'entirely', 'separate', 'things', 'sometimes', 'just', 'have', 'look', 'such', 'Consider', '1974', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'adaptation', ""'Salem"", 'Lot', 'were', ""n't"", 'adaptation', 'Thomas', 'Rockwell', 'novel', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'saying', 'gross-factor', 'Better', 'worms', 'infantile', 'potty', 'humor', 'Ant', 'Bully', 'motivations', 'characters', 'are', 'shallow', 'silly', 'Compared', 'Cars', 'characters', 'are', 'as', 'well-drawn', 'major', 'character', 'War', 'Peace', 'episodic', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'Three', 'words', 'Hedge', 'Comparatively', 'one', 'best', 'kids', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'willing', 'concede', 'just', 'been', 'awful', 'year', 'kids', 'movies', 'have', 'just', 'everything', 'attract', 'pre-teen', 'set', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'want', 'eight-year-old', 'running', 'around', 'yelling', 'sphincter', 'day', 'afterwards', '**']",N/A

I hope to find some young talent, before anyone else knows who they are, a unique story, and a funny scene or two. Unfortunately, the story here is quite disgusting and there weren't any stand out performances, but there was a really funny scene, where the nerdy kid gets caught playing dance dance revolution. The story begins when a new kid named Billy (Luke Benward) moves to town. The other kids immediately try to intimidate him, by replacing his lunch with a bag of worms. To their surprise, in defiance, Billy eats the worms and gains their respect. One thing leads to another and eventually a very disgusting competition is born. The film is based on a very popular children's book and that's really who this film was intended for. Occasionally, you get some surprises out of a film like this, but as I said earlier, there really wasn't any stand out talent here.

The story centers around a classroom bully, and how a new kid at school deals with his antics.The acting and cast are wonderful, and filled with many unique characters. Just looking at many of the kids will have you smiling or laughing.While the movie centers around a disgusting topic (eating worms), it is at heart a story not about a worm eating contest, but about how children come together and do the right thing in the face of a repressive bully.Children will love this film, as it allows them to process the handling of difficult school mates in a healthy and fun way. Push past the ""ick"" factor and take your family to see this film. It will leave you laughing, thinking and feeling good that you have seen it.One final note: some reviews will put down How To Eat Fried Worms because it involves a disgusting subject. Anyone who has had children knows how they love to talk about icky things and body functions. My nephew and daughter both loved the film because it allowed kids to be kids, and see things that kids love to see and talk about. All this and a wonderful story as well.Another gem from Walden.Total Score (out of 100) = 7635 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.9 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?9 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?10 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace.

1024075,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000J10FLY,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 1]","This is a kids movie in every sense of the term. So, as a guy in his mid-twenties, it's really unfair of me to review this movie. That being said, I'm going to anyway. I'm just going to review it as to what it ""seems"" like to me, rather than if it's a movie that I really liked or would want to see again.How to Eat Fried Worms seems like a movie that young kids (maybe 10 and under) will love. Everything is very G-rated, where even the bullies of the school are pretty much white-bread suburban kids and not actual tough guys. Gross out humor, slapstick comedy, and silly sound effects abound. Even the scenes involving the parents are geared towards kids. And by the end all the kids learn a valuable lesson about friendship and sticking up for yourself and all that.The best part of the movie is the main character's little brother Woody. That little kid is hilarious. Other than that, this film doesn't have much to offer anyone over the age of 12, but since it's clearly not made for anyone over the age of 12, that's not really a drawback, is it? If you're looking for a good family movie, then this is it. If you're not, then this isn't it.I checked it out because it was filmed in Austin, but the film keeps the location pretty generic.",3,How to make a kids movie,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,1245,"['kids', 'movie', 'sense', 'term', 'So', 'guy', 'mid-twenties', 'really', 'unfair', 'review', 'movie', 'being', 'said', ""'m"", 'going', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'review', 'what', 'rather', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'again.How', 'Eat', 'Fried', 'Worms', 'movie', 'young', 'kids', 'maybe', '10', 'will', 'love', 'Everything', 'very', 'G-rated', 'where', 'even', 'bullies', 'school', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'white-bread', 'suburban', 'kids', 'not', 'actual', 'tough', 'guys', 'Gross', 'out', 'humor', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'silly', 'sound', 'effects', 'abound', 'Even', 'scenes', 'involving', 'parents', 'are', 'geared', 'towards', 'kids', 'end', 'kids', 'learn', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'friendship', 'sticking', 'up', 'that.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'little', 'brother', 'Woody', 'little', 'kid', 'hilarious', 'Other', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'offer', 'anyone', 'age', '12', 'clearly', 'not', 'made', 'anyone', 'age', '12', 'not', 'really', 'drawback', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'then', ""'re"", 'not', 'then', ""n't"", 'it.I', 'checked', 'out', 'was', 'filmed', 'Austin', 'film', 'location', 'pretty', 'generic']",N/A
