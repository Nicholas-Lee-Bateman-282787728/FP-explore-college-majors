A little slow at times but full of &#34;Peace and Love&#34; message thru out the movie.  I enjoy the aliens way of putting the fate of man into the hands of average people.  The actions of the leaders reflect the opinions of the 1950's and the cold war.  When push comes to shove, it is the basic good of man that wins out.

He tells them:  that he is from a nearby universe (star system), that their star is going to explode in 35 days, and that there is no world for them to move to.  Earth would be a suitable planet for them to settle on, but they would rather go extinct than to invade a planet with intelligent life.However, they are well aware of the human penchant for warfare, of the human race's insatiable urge to develop ever more powerful weapons; that perhaps, the aliens could provide the humans, what they wish for, that is, an ultimate weapon, a device that leaves every structure intact, harms no lifeforms except humans, killing them within 1,500 miles of the designated target.  If, in 27 days, the humans use the weapons and exterminate the human race, then then aliens are saved. . . .But there is something important about the weapons not told; will the humans discover the secret in time?Note:  the brief flying saucer footage is from ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers.""Picture: 3.5;  widescreen, measured AR: 1.85:1;  B&W.;  Subtitles: none.

805133,AAW58LG72PG7I,B0001GWK3I,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[29, 39]","THE 27th DAY falls in the same category of anti-red science fiction dramas that predominated in the 1950s.  The communists were pictured as pure evil and the sci-fi theme was made to fit in.  Here, an alien who call himself the Alien (Arnold Moss) kidnaps five human beings and takes them to an orbiting flying saucer.  Speaking excellent English (Moss was a noted thespian), the Alien gives each a tiny box which contains two capsules.  These capsules are weapons of enormous power.  The idea is that he wants to see whether they will turn over to their respective governments the secrets of their destructive potential.  The Alien explains that his planet orbits a sun that will soon go nova and they need the earth in one piece for their population.  However, they have a Star Trek-like Prime Directive that prohibits them from direct interference.  But their morality does permit them to hand humanity the means to eradicate all human beings while leaving the real estate unscathed.  The alien stacks the deck against earth by broadcasting world wide the identities of the five.  One of them, a Chinese female peasant immediately kills herself rather than give up her capsules.  Another is a Russian soldier who is unmericifully tortured by his Kremlin bosses until he divulges his box.  The third, an English woman (Valerie French) throws her capsules into the ocean and arranges a meeting with the fourth (Gene Barry) with whom she conveniently falls in love.  The fifth is a scientist (George Voskovic) who dares not tell what he knows.  The plot focuses on the morality of the five vis-a-vis the pragmatic morality of the world's superpowers (Russia and America) who debate the ethics of using the weapon as quickly as possible in a pre-emptive fashion.  The United States chooses not to use it.  Russia intends to do so at the earliest moment.  THE 27th DAY presents a not so pretty picture of human morality.  Only the ethics of a very few can permit the world to go on living even at the cost of an altruistic race who could play tricks with morality to ensure the destruction of one species while assuring the survival of another.",3,Anti-Red Drama,1251936000,"09 3, 2009",2009,2142,"['27th', 'DAY', 'same', 'category', 'anti-red', 'science', 'fiction', 'dramas', 'predominated', '1950s', 'communists', 'were', 'pictured', 'pure', 'evil', 'sci-fi', 'theme', 'was', 'made', 'fit', 'Here', 'alien', 'who', 'Alien', 'Arnold', 'Moss', 'five', 'human', 'beings', 'orbiting', 'flying', 'saucer', 'Speaking', 'excellent', 'English', 'Moss', 'was', 'noted', 'thespian', 'Alien', 'tiny', 'box', 'two', 'capsules', 'capsules', 'are', 'weapons', 'enormous', 'power', 'idea', 'see', 'will', 'turn', 'respective', 'governments', 'secrets', 'destructive', 'potential', 'Alien', 'planet', 'sun', 'will', 'soon', 'go', 'nova', 'need', 'earth', 'one', 'piece', 'population', 'However', 'have', 'Star', 'Trek-like', 'Prime', 'Directive', 'direct', 'interference', 'morality', 'permit', 'hand', 'humanity', 'means', 'eradicate', 'human', 'beings', 'leaving', 'real', 'estate', 'unscathed', 'alien', 'deck', 'earth', 'broadcasting', 'world', 'wide', 'identities', 'five', 'One', 'Chinese', 'female', 'peasant', 'immediately', 'rather', 'give', 'up', 'capsules', 'Russian', 'soldier', 'who', 'unmericifully', 'tortured', 'Kremlin', 'box', 'third', 'English', 'woman', 'Valerie', 'French', 'capsules', 'ocean', 'meeting', 'fourth', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'whom', 'conveniently', 'love', 'fifth', 'scientist', 'George', 'Voskovic', 'who', 'not', 'tell', 'what', 'plot', 'morality', 'five', 'vis-a-vis', 'pragmatic', 'morality', 'world', 'superpowers', 'Russia', 'America', 'who', 'debate', 'ethics', 'using', 'weapon', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'pre-emptive', 'fashion', 'United', 'States', 'not', 'use', 'Russia', 'do', 'so', 'earliest', 'moment', '27th', 'DAY', 'not', 'so', 'pretty', 'picture', 'human', 'morality', 'Only', 'ethics', 'very', 'few', 'can', 'permit', 'world', 'go', 'living', 'even', 'cost', 'altruistic', 'race', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'tricks', 'morality', 'ensure', 'destruction', 'one', 'species', 'assuring', 'survival']",The 27th Day
