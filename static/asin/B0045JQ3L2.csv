1385704,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0045JQ3L2,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[5, 7]","Two thirtysomething gay men from Los Angeles flee to a quiet guesthouse in Palm Springs, to escape the media.  One of them is Graham Windsor (Steve Callahan), a soap opera actor whose gay sex tape just outed him and cost him his job.  The other is Trey Reed (Matthew Montgomery), a well-known activist for gay marriage, who was caught cheating on his own spouse.  The two clash at first, with the openly gay activist considering the closeted actor as a coward, but it soon becomes evident there is a real spark between them, sexually as well as helping them each open up and be honest about their situations and options.This is the latest of Rob Williams' writer/director credits (also did ""Long Term Relationship,"" ""Back Soon,"" and ""Make the Yuletide Gay"" - the latter one of my favorites of 2009, and I am glad to hear a sequel should be out later this year!), and he seems to get better with each one. A well conceived, realistic story, likeable characters played by capable actors, and beautifully photographed, with tasteful erotic content (unrated, but would be an R). Supporting actors stealing several scenes are Jm J Bullock as the actor's agent, and David Pevsner as the older innkeeper.  That said, considering the story is rather simple, I thought the dialogue was a bit wordy at times, but did not detract from the film for my enjoyment.

The movie, at best, is an insult to any gay man or woman who is seeking to find a lasting and meaningful relationship.  You DON'T find one by lying your a$$ off from the get-go.  And if you believe this is the way the REAL world works, then you'll also believe that West Hollywood isn't populated mainly by twinks.The premise for this movie is a gay man (playing a lead as a super-hunk STRAIGHT male on a soap) is supposedly outed by his lover--for publicity purposes or whatever.  He holes up at a little B/B in Palm Springs (where else?), swims nude a lot, talks to his agent, and tries to make the viewer feel sorry for him.  Enter the second gay man--the poster boy for the gay marriage issue.  He, too, is on splitsville with his lesser half because of an alleged extra-maritial affair.  Gasp.  The two meat, er, meet while lounging at the pool, lustfull glances are exchanged, and viola, they're in bed.  NEVER saw that coming.  But, I digress.What you then endure are seemingly endless hours of well-intended dialogue--just not BELIEVABLE dialogue.  Oh, and we get a twist.  Seems straight-playing soap boy LIED about what had really happened in his life AND poster boy for gay marriage LIED as well.  Isn't that the way we all begin our relationships?  It seems straight soap boy was the one that leaked his porn tape; it was poster boy's lesser half that cheated, but he decided to take the fall.  Yeah; right.  And these are magic beans.  I'm sure that if I had spent a good portion of my life trying to sell the idea of gay marriage, I'M gonna' be the one that takes the fall when my marriage falls apart over a rumoured extra-marital affair.  And what's even more ridiculous is that the two liars get mad at one another when the ""truth comes out.""

In the past I have enjoyed Rob Williams other movies like ""Back Soon"" and ""Long-Term Relationship."" I wish I could say the same for ""Role/Play."" While the concept for the film sounds fine on paper, the execution fell flat. It had nothing to do with the two leads, Montgomery and Steve Callahan, who had wonderful chemistry, but everything to do with the script.Normally in a Rob Williams' film we have a lot of diverse characters, including roles played by women. In ""Role/Play"" it seemed more like a two-man play rather than ensemble movie. Now David Pevsner shined as the innkeeper/mentor, but with no other strong secondary characters like in ""Back Soon"" (Bret Wolfe, Maggie McCollester) or ""Long-Term Relationship"" (Artie O'Daly, Chuti Tiu) the film was left to Montgomery and Callahan to carry. While their on-screen chemistry sizzled, the dialog was long-winded, preachy and at times utterly boring. It would have played perfectly on stage, but for film it just made the movie drag.I won't even get into the improbability of two people meeting on vacation and falling instantly in love and willing to throw away their careers just to be together, as normally I am the biggest romantic on the planet and love a storyline like that; however I just couldn't buy it in ""Role/Play.""I'd love to see Matthew and his partner Steve do another film together, but this film will not be staying in my movie library, which is a shame as I have watched and re-watched ""Back Soon"" so many times, and recommended it to friends.

Tray Reed (played by Matthew Montgomery), is a married Gay Rights activist, facing a divorce.  The men meet, and recognize each other, at a secluded Inn in Palm Springs.  Their attraction to each other heats up quickly, and with it comes intense discussion concerning the issues each is dealing with.  Discussion brings the truths that they must face before they can go on with their lives, whether together or apart.  David Pevsner (plays Alex, the owner of the Inn) adds humor and common sense to the situation. Brian Nolan (plays Ricky, a guest) brings youthful wisdom and truth.Role/Play, originally released in 2010, is particularly relevant following the Supreme Court decision of June 26, 2013. The discussion points in the film are pertinent whether one is Gay or straight. It is said that to provide a good review, one should admit to any bias the reviewer may have. I must confess.

Just beneath the surface lies some very significant writing conveying what every gay person needs to stop and listen(watch) to.First comes an examination of the roles we all play.  I think most viewers will immediately react to think and say that while many play roles, they themselves do not.  With repeated viewings of this film, I realized more and more how absolutely true it is.  We play roles for our parents.  We play roles at work.  We create/invent personas to deal with what life gives up and sometimes--many times--we lose ourselves in it all.  Role/Play is a strong signal that we all need to stop and look at ourselves and our roles in our surroundings.The second message, which I found meaningful was the commentary on gay media becoming a slave to sales and using straight allies of the gay community to achieve sales goals.  In this pursuit, gay media and pay people lose sight of the fact we are important without our straight allies and that our straight allies in our mainstream media dilute our importance to some extent.The writing, directing and acting in Role/Play are all first rate.

Plus the fact that the two men are so compatible together, not to mention cute, doesn'thurt either. I've seen a few movies with Matthew Montgomery-Gone but not Forgotten, and recently Socket, bothwere pretty good, this didn't dissapoint either, granted this film is more for gays than straight, but it's thoroughly enjoyable. The sex scenes aren't explicit overall, slightly soft-core and the nudity isn't verygraphic either, making it watchable for mainstream  audience as well.",4,Even celebrities have a right to privacy,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,818,"['First', 'believe', 'even', 'celebrities', 'have', 'right', 'privacy', 'what', 'paparazzi', 'think/say.This', 'movie', 'concept', 'very', 'well', 'Matthew', 'Steve', 'do', 'roles', 'very', 'effectively', 'storyis', 'little', 'slow', 'men', 'have', 'secrets', 'are', 'eventually', 'revealed', 'ending', 'middlesequences', 'fact', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'so', 'compatible', 'together', 'not', 'mention', 'cute', ""doesn'thurt"", ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'movies', 'Matthew', 'Montgomery-Gone', 'not', 'Forgotten', 'recently', 'Socket', 'bothwere', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'dissapoint', 'either', 'granted', 'film', 'more', 'gays', 'straight', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'explicit', 'overall', 'slightly', 'soft-core', 'nudity', ""n't"", 'verygraphic', 'making', 'watchable', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'as', 'well']",Role/Play

I asked why is this movie so horrible, it does have potential? Well., it is the bad bad acting of the character, Matthew Montgomery needs to be typecast.... I have said enough!!",1,role play...maybe!
