In this latest Prime Suspect Helen Mirren uncovers the murderer of 2 Bosnian refugees. The suspect turns out to be a Bosnia Serb war criminal, but is protected by the British government a la Szell in Marathon Man. Jane Tennison is older and wiser as she goes against orders to bring the mass killer turned smooth London professional to justice.The script writing is superior, even to the earlier episodes, as we get this psychological cat and mouse between Jane and the suspect, his wife, and his underling. And as part of the investigation Jane even travels to Bosnia and has the inevitable affair with her assistant.

This episode is about a war criminal who is continuing his dark work in London on the same pair of sisters that he tortured in Bosnia during the war.I really liked this one because it dealt with Bosnia and I have always been interested in that area.  It is also refreshing to see a sadistic war criminal brought to justice even if it is on the small screen.I don't recommend this for everyone because it is very dark and depressing.

807368,ANY46RC9MF6DB,B0001I56LE,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[2, 2]","This is one of my favorite Prime Suspect movies, and I think the producers would have been wise to have made it Helen Mirren's ultimate Jane Tennison performance rather than her penultimate.The acting is wonderful, especially the actress playing Jasmine.  The story line, based on a massacre that took place in the Bosnian war of the 1990s, is moving, the people, Muslim refuges from Bosnia, are sympathetic, and the villain, who initially seems charming, is eventually revealed as despicable. Individual performances are all interesting, and contribute to the development of the story.The actor playing Jane's father has a brief, but unforgettable scene describing a tragic incident following the Holocaust, and the villain's attractive wife is ultimately contemptible in her willingness to tolerate evil, while the woman playing a British Secret Service representative is almost as hateful as the villain is.The story line is engrossing.  The only objection I have is to wonder why the police who are trying to find Jasmine, a hospital employee who is in danger, don't use the public address system requesting that she go to the nearest nurse's station, and use that phone to call the receptionist's desk where at least one officer could wait.  This also provides Jasmine the protection of witnesses.  Instead, the police race up and down the halls looking for her.But Prime Suspect 6 is well done and is a movie that I'll enjoy watching again and again.",5,One of the Best of the Bunch,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,1456,"['one', 'favorite', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'movies', 'think', 'producers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wise', 'have', 'made', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'ultimate', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'performance', 'rather', 'penultimate.The', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'actress', 'playing', 'Jasmine', 'story', 'line', 'based', 'massacre', 'took', 'place', 'Bosnian', 'war', '1990s', 'moving', 'people', 'Muslim', 'Bosnia', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'villain', 'who', 'initially', 'charming', 'eventually', 'revealed', 'despicable', 'Individual', 'performances', 'are', 'interesting', 'contribute', 'development', 'story.The', 'actor', 'playing', 'Jane', 'father', 'brief', 'unforgettable', 'scene', 'describing', 'tragic', 'incident', 'following', 'Holocaust', 'villain', 'attractive', 'wife', 'ultimately', 'contemptible', 'willingness', 'tolerate', 'evil', 'woman', 'playing', 'British', 'Secret', 'Service', 'representative', 'almost', 'as', 'hateful', 'villain', 'is.The', 'story', 'line', 'engrossing', 'only', 'objection', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'police', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'Jasmine', 'hospital', 'employee', 'who', 'danger', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'public', 'address', 'system', 'requesting', 'go', 'nearest', 'nurse', 'station', 'use', 'phone', 'call', 'receptionist', 'desk', 'where', 'least', 'one', 'officer', 'could', 'wait', 'also', 'Jasmine', 'protection', 'witnesses', 'Instead', 'police', 'race', 'up', 'halls', 'looking', 'her.But', 'Prime', 'Suspect', '6', 'well', 'done', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'again', 'again']",Prime Suspect 6 - The Last Witness

Suffice to say, it is more taut, edgy, fast-paced, and visually compelling than the preceeding films.  Obviously, the great script was paramount  in Ms. Mirren's decision to return to the role.My review has to do with the DVD presentation.  I obtained this U.S. release from Netflix before I knew that it had been cropped and mastered in pan & scan.  Much of this film has been shot with a super wide-angle lens, so after 30 seconds of viewing that P&S; bastardization, it went back in the Netflix return envelope.  Then I purchased the widescreen Region 2 PAL version from Amazon UK.  It arrived in Los Angeles in under 10 days.I have a Sony 34"" 16X9 direct-view set, and an all-region JVC NTSC/PAL DVD player.  You can pick up name-brand all-region NTSC/PAL players all over the web for usually less than $100.  They come in very handy with DVD's that are not available in the U.S.The Region 2 disc looked fabulous; I cannot imagine watching this film butchered in P&S.;  I highly suggest buying the widescreen version.When you view all the other Pime Suspect DVD's, which are all also mastered in pan & scan, you realize they were  originally filmed in widescreen.

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[32, 34]","Helen Mirren once again returns in her Emmy Award-winning role as Jane Tennison in what is, I believe, the series' most powerful police drama yet. This sixth episode in Prime Suspect, ""The Last Witness,"" has Tennison hunting down the leaders of a paramilitary death squad in London. These men had perpetrated heinous crimes against humanity during the Balkan Civil War and could possibly be the cause of a terrible murder in Jane's jurisdiction.Former Chief Detective Tennison, has now been promoted to overseeing all murder investigations in London. She is, as usual, battling the male establishment and coming to grips with advancing middle-age. At 54 she feels she is being pushed toward early retirement and the pressure and presence of ambitious younger colleagues who would love to have her job are ever present. At this point in her life Jane Tennison is also beginning to realize that her career has become her life - a sad and lonely realization.When the body of a young Bosnian woman turns up, with signs of brutal, sadistic torture, Jane takes over the case. Her investigation leads her to one man, and perhaps two, who are alleged war criminals with much to hide as they attempt to make new lives for themselves in Britain. The murdered woman's older sister is finally found and promised protection in return for her story and assistance with the ongoing investigation. The police protection proves to be weaker than the will of the murderer to eliminate all possible witnesses to his crimes. And disaster strikes again with horrifying results. As usual Tennison risks all in her determination to bring the guilty to justice and in this sixth episode ""all"" could mean her career.The Prime Suspect series has long been a favorite. Helen Mirren is superb as an actress in any role and absolutely shines as Jane Tennison. Ms. Mirren lends the correct mix of tough independence and vulnerability that are such an important part of the character. And her face mirrors all the emotion her character is feeling more eloquently than words. I heard Ms. Mirren say, in a recent interview with the press, that this will be the last Prime Suspect episode. I am very sorry to see it end but can't imagine a more fitting conclusion.

The combination of a stellar cast, a fantastic script, inventive cinematography, and a haunting score add up to one of the more entertaining dramas I've seen, period.  Helen Mirren is, as usual, outstanding in the role of Jane Tennison.  The character is as strong as ever there is a real depth to her character in PS6, including some great scenes with Jane's father.  I recommend this wholeheartedly.  If you're a fan of Prime Suspect, and who else would be looking at this, you are going to love it.I agree that the fact it is not widescreen is a disappointment, but it is still very enjoyable.
