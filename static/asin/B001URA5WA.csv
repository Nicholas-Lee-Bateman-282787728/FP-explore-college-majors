Aside from the scenic values of the places he visited, he really did not deliver on survival techniques.  He suffered through most of his shows.  It finally struck me that he was something of an adventurer who really did not know his limits.  He is lucky to still be alive.",4,Surviving not Living,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,454,"['Poor', 'old', 'Les', 'always', 'started', 'out', 'shows', 'sense', 'optimism', 'end', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'major', 'complainer', 'plights', 'put', 'Aside', 'scenic', 'values', 'places', 'visited', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'deliver', 'survival', 'techniques', 'suffered', 'most', 'shows', 'finally', 'struck', 'was', 'something', 'adventurer', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'limits', 'lucky', 'still', 'be', 'alive']",Survivorman: Season 3

1239268,A209QRVZ99UQDC,B001URA5WA,Calamity Jane,"[5, 16]","The Sierra Nevada has Les ""lost"" while a search party hunts for him. He has a backpack, a tent, a sleeping bag and his guitar. While in the Rockies he had two horses, one for him and one for his camera equipment, a makeshift bedroll, canvas to make a shelter, and a fishing rod. Is this survival or a camping trip?Another episode has Les stranded in the jungle of Papua, New Guinea. Most of the time he complains about his surroundings and the claustrophobia brought on by the jungle. But as soon as Les steps out of the wet rainforest and into the open he whines about the sun making him sweat. He brought bananas, nuts, candy and other treats with him this time. He reminds us for the 100th time how difficult it is for him to film his adventures, and how he could die if he breaks an ankle or gets bitten by a poisonous spider. We also get four full minutes of him chewing on jungle nuts, while he spits, drools and gets high.Nothing thrilling about the Outback either, except he didn't complain as much about having to shuffle his camera equipment around. Splitting one match into two isn't new and exciting, nor is watching him filter water through sand, or pluck edible bugs from the trees.Les tries to catch a pig, but fails. Les tries to snare a rat, but fails. He couldn't even catch one bird out of a flock of 12 or more. He talks constantly about having diarrhea and vomiting from drinking bad water. He couldn't cross a stream because he was afraid he'd fall. Then came the bemoaning about the rash and jungle fungus on his feet. He whined about the ants, the ticks, the spiders, the mosquitoes, the rain and the weather, and even the bad dreams brought on my hunger. Good grief.There are only six episodes on this DVD, but that's probably just as well. I couldn't stand much more of his suffering and bemoaning.The first two seasons were first rate. This third is lacking in luster and thrills. The Survivorman series is getting stale and repetitive. Les doesn't appear to be enjoying himself anymore.I hope Les has something new up his sleeve. I love this guy. I'd hate for him to just disappear from the screen or, God forbid, to keep doing what he's doing, which is complaining all the time. Les is a fantastic photographer and survivalist, but it's time for a change.",2,Not As Good as Season One and Two,1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,2284,"['Sierra', 'Nevada', 'Les', 'lost', 'search', 'party', 'hunts', 'backpack', 'tent', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'guitar', 'Rockies', 'had', 'two', 'horses', 'one', 'one', 'camera', 'equipment', 'makeshift', 'bedroll', 'canvas', 'make', 'shelter', 'fishing', 'rod', 'survival', 'camping', 'trip', 'episode', 'Les', 'stranded', 'jungle', 'Papua', 'New', 'Guinea', 'Most', 'time', 'surroundings', 'claustrophobia', 'brought', 'jungle', 'as', 'soon', 'Les', 'wet', 'rainforest', 'open', 'sun', 'making', 'sweat', 'brought', 'bananas', 'nuts', 'candy', 'other', 'treats', 'time', '100th', 'time', 'how', 'difficult', 'film', 'adventures', 'how', 'could', 'die', 'ankle', 'bitten', 'poisonous', 'spider', 'also', 'get', 'four', 'full', 'minutes', 'chewing', 'jungle', 'nuts', 'drools', 'high.Nothing', 'thrilling', 'Outback', 'did', ""n't"", 'complain', 'as', 'much', 'having', 'shuffle', 'camera', 'equipment', 'around', 'Splitting', 'one', 'match', 'two', ""n't"", 'new', 'exciting', 'watching', 'filter', 'water', 'sand', 'edible', 'bugs', 'trees.Les', 'catch', 'pig', 'Les', 'snare', 'rat', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'catch', 'one', 'bird', 'flock', '12', 'more', 'constantly', 'having', 'diarrhea', 'vomiting', 'drinking', 'bad', 'water', 'could', ""n't"", 'cross', 'stream', 'was', 'afraid', ""'d"", 'fall', 'Then', 'came', 'bemoaning', 'rash', 'jungle', 'fungus', 'feet', 'whined', 'ants', 'ticks', 'spiders', 'mosquitoes', 'rain', 'weather', 'even', 'bad', 'dreams', 'brought', 'hunger', 'Good', 'grief.There', 'are', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'much', 'more', 'suffering', 'bemoaning.The', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'first', 'rate', 'third', 'lacking', 'luster', 'thrills', 'Survivorman', 'series', 'getting', 'stale', 'repetitive', 'Les', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'enjoying', 'hope', 'Les', 'something', 'new', 'sleeve', 'love', 'guy', ""'d"", 'hate', 'just', 'disappear', 'screen', 'God', 'forbid', 'keep', 'doing', 'what', 'doing', 'complaining', 'time', 'Les', 'fantastic', 'photographer', 'survivalist', 'time', 'change']",Survivorman: Season 3

1239282,AOFC8T8U7WUGV,B001URA5WA,Roland,"[4, 4]","Season Three of ""Survivorman"" was supposed to be the last. Les Stroud was physically worn out from producing, what is in my opinion, the most ""real"" reality-type show on television. Apparently, after reaching this decision in 2008, he has since changed his mind and is currently producing new episodes. I'm glad.Survivorman is the aforementioned Les Stroud; a Canadian outdoorsman who, in the past worked as a roadie for the band Rush and also for MTV Canada (!). The concept of his show is quite simple: He goes to an isolated location, hot or cold, and spends seven days there....surviving. Alone.Les travels to six locations/episodes for season three. The six episodes are contained on two discs:Disc 1Sierra NevadaLes goes hiking and gets ""lost"". A search party is sent looking for him as he deliberately wanders deeper into the woods, making it that more difficult for the search party to find him.Colorado RockiesLes sets out with two pack horses into the Rockies for a week. Having the horses with him is a blessing and curse: they provide him with companionship, but he has to take care of them as well as himself.Arctic TundraLes travels to Baffin Island in the Arctic Archipelago (between Northeast Canada and Greenland) and survives in the brutal cold and ""eeriness"" of 24 hour daylight.Disc 2Deep WoodsFor the first time ever on Surviviorman, Les isn't alone as he brings a hunting partner with him to the Boreal Forest in Canada.Australian OutbackLes has to ""emergency land"" his ultralight in the Australian Outback.Papua New Guinea (the series ""finale"")Near the end of the series finale, two men approach Les at his camp. One is carrying a machete (well, it is the finale, right?).Disc 1 also contains a bonus episode: ""Surviving Urban Disasters"", which is fine in its own right, but I believe I would have preferred a ""Making of Season Three"" instead.I honestly have to rate all six episodes with five stars each.  Granted, I am a huge fan of the show but I cannot think of a single reason to rate any of them with even four and a half stars.All of these episodes stand out to me but the Arctic Tundra episode is my favorite (if I had to pick one) for its environment and visuals.Les also has his best success ever with obtaining food in this episode, too....which is another reason why I like the show so much: Les Stroud is upfront about everything he does. He scouts the location out before-hand; brings an emergency GPS phone with him in case of disaster; has an emergency camp nearby; and, except for a few items he carries with him (ranging from one match to a paper clip--or even a can of soda): he has to find his own food, build his own fires and make his own shelters. Alone. For seven days.If this makes what Les does sound too easy, try camping outside in your own backyard for a week....with full access to your refrigerator, to boot.I also appreciate that he is never gratuitous in any way with his actions. He spares us the gory details of cleaning and de-shelling a turtle, for example. Furthermore, unlike the crews featured on Deadliest Catch, he watches his language. Very rarely does he swear. Having kids of his own, he fully gets it that kids are watching his show, too, and behaves himself accordingly.A humorous example, however,  of when Les does swear occurs during the first season (while he is gathering firewood) and all of a sudden he screams: ""Holy s***! A rattlesnake!""But, you get my point. (And, once again, he spares us the cleaning and preparing for dinner of the rattlesnake).Discovery rates all Survivorman episodes TV-PG.I strongly encourage you to give this series a try.
