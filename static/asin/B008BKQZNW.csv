1549696,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B008BKQZNW,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[15, 15]","Elliot is a cute Latino 21 year old gay boy who is looking for love in New York City ...  not exactly an original concept in itself, but this film is unique in its approach and characters, making it a must-see, in my opinion.Scenes of the current day Elliot, meeting a series of men who turn out to be shallow, not interested in a committed relationship and seemingly incapable of love, are interspersed with scenes from Elliot's childhood, growing up with a single mom who seems to be attracted to men that are no good for her or her son.  His mother's futile search for love, as well as the abuse they both suffer from one of her boyfriends, no doubt impact on Elliot's need to be securely loved and protected.The acting is a cut above what you would expect from a low-budget indie, especially the two actors who play Elliot, as a child and young adult.  Numerous Latino actors play Elliot's friends and family, lending a realistic, warm tone to the film.  The direction is excellent, including creative touches, such as the use of animated sequences in one of Elliot's ""looking for love"" adventures and in the closing credits.  Featured at numerous film festivals, and won Best Feature at the Miami Gay & Lesbian Film Festival.  DVD includes commentary, extended scenes and trailer.  Not rated, but would be a light ""R"" for sexual content.  This is a positive gay portrayal that you would likely not hesitate to share with a mixed audience.

A young man who will do what it takes to find a healthy, loving relationship with another man. He's looking for a boyfriend and a mate. Life is hard and sometimes even quite brutal. But every time you knock Elliot down, he gets back up again! He's not capable of giving up. He loves life too much!Elliot Loves is about relationships. There is zero camp in this film. The sex scenes are tastefully done. There is very little stereotyping. Homophobia and prejudice against LGBTQ people within and outside the Hispanic community is not addressed at all, which I see as a sign of progress. The Gay community in 2013 is finally free to exam love, commitment and the difficult process of finding a mate as heterosexuals have been doing since the birth of filmmaking in the early 1900's!Both actors who play Elliot, one as a child, and the other as an adult do a magnificent job. They put their hearts and souls into their respective performances and it shows. I felt like I got to know them, that's how good the character development is!Why can't Hollywood make more beautiful gay films like Elliot Loves?

What role does seductive selfish Mom and absent, selfish Dad play in Elliot's sexual orientation -- in his searching for the right guy to love, like his mother?  Realizing he is the only boy  at show-and-tell in his classroom about to present drawings of women's dresses rather than of sports gear, Elliot freezes.  He refuses to show and tell what he has brought.  He also freezes his identity by coming home and lying, telling mom that his pictures won a medal, to make her feel better, and to cement himself as the only real man in her life.

Sure he's a tad rough around the edges, but in terms of capturing the youthful exuberance of Elliot and how he talks a mile a minute about himself and his life is quite endearing. He's well-cast as the young mad who seems to follow along wherever his heart leads him with little concern for the consequences. At times some of his expressions may seem almost like caricatures of real people, but then you may be forgetting that (1) this movie is still a comedy and (2) there are young men who actually behave like this.Quentin Araujo is equally impressive in his scenes as the younger Elliot and he certainly stands toe-to-toe with Elena Goode. And given roughly half the movie is his to bring to life, I did not find myself disliking his scenes or wishing to see more of the older Elliot. Both stories remained fairly well executed.Now in most gay movies, we're used to seeing a fair amount of skin involving ridiculously beautiful or significantly muscled individuals. In Elliot Loves, we have more &#34;natural&#34; actors cast in the movie who are still fairly attractive or the types of guys you could imagine actually getting into bed with without the need to look like they live in gyms. And I really appreciated this aspect to things - it kept the movie more focused on its story and keeping things real as opposed to casting more &#34;idealized&#34; guys that inevitably maintain a bit of distance between the viewer and the material.The movie features both silly comedic moments (like Elliot's dance to show he's clean) and rather heavy moments (a lot of the scenes with his mother) and manages to balance the differences between the two pretty well. There are moments when you wonder why we spend more time with either the younger or the older Elliot and how it will all come together and other times you can't help but wish we didn't cut away so soon.

Sweet story because main characters are good hearted people.  Very romantic story of a mother and a son, both leading with their chin's in their love life, so we witness them both taking some blows.  Especially liked the sex scenes between Elliot and his lovers, where the characters seemed to genuinely like, love, lust, demonstrate affection and interest, in one another.  Well done filmmaking team.",3,I liked it...(SPOILERS),1372377600,"06 28, 2013",2013,585,"['young', 'boy', 'raised', 'single', 'parent', 'household', 'mother', 'looking', 'love', 'not', 'always', 'choosing', 'wisely', 'later', 'son', 'looking', 'love', 'not', 'always', 'choosing', 'wisely', 'Sweet', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'hearted', 'people', 'Very', 'romantic', 'story', 'mother', 'son', 'leading', 'chin', 'love', 'life', 'witness', 'taking', 'blows', 'Especially', 'liked', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Elliot', 'lovers', 'where', 'characters', 'seemed', 'genuinely', 'love', 'lust', 'demonstrate', 'affection', 'interest', 'one', 'Well', 'done', 'filmmaking', 'team']",Elliot Loves

1549719,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B008BKQZNW,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[3, 4]","This is the story of Elliot, who was born to a mother of simple tastes that is so far as having a man in her life is concerned. She had Elliot as an unintended consequence of those tastes. We meet him as a ten year old growing up as a Dominican Republic, American in New York. Apparently Elliot is old German meaning `he who walks with God', well he is not exactly religious but he does like a man in his life, just like his mum, and he has the same problem regarding holding on to them too.We follow Elliot in the ups and downs involved with trying to find love and it is really quite funny and touching in places. The sound levels are an issue but hardly a deal breaker and the acting is all above fine. Elliot's mate Hector played by Robin de Jesus is particularly likeable. We also have some real cringe worthy chat up lines and some minimalist bedroom antics, but nothing too full on, so if that is your thing then best to avoid.This is an independent effort and whilst it may be apparent to the movie aficionado it does not lose any of its charm and to quote Elliot from the film - `it's tough being special', and I actually really enjoyed this despite having read some negative copy on this film. If you keep your mind well open you should be able to get something out of this rather good gay based film.",4,Amusing Story of a Gay Dominican in New York,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,1311,"['story', 'Elliot', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'mother', 'simple', 'tastes', 'so', 'far', 'having', 'man', 'life', 'concerned', 'had', 'Elliot', 'unintended', 'consequence', 'tastes', 'meet', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'growing', 'up', 'Dominican', 'Republic', 'American', 'New', 'York', 'Apparently', 'Elliot', 'old', 'German', 'meaning', 'who', 'God', 'well', 'not', 'exactly', 'religious', 'man', 'life', 'just', 'mum', 'same', 'problem', 'regarding', 'holding', 'too.We', 'follow', 'Elliot', 'ups', 'downs', 'involved', 'trying', 'find', 'love', 'really', 'quite', 'funny', 'touching', 'places', 'sound', 'levels', 'are', 'issue', 'hardly', 'deal', 'breaker', 'acting', 'fine', 'Elliot', 'mate', 'Hector', 'played', 'Robin', 'de', 'Jesus', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'also', 'have', 'real', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'up', 'lines', 'minimalist', 'bedroom', 'antics', 'nothing', 'too', 'full', 'so', 'thing', 'then', 'best', 'avoid.This', 'independent', 'effort', 'whilst', 'may', 'be', 'apparent', 'movie', 'not', 'lose', 'charm', 'quote', 'Elliot', 'film', 'tough', 'being', 'special', 'actually', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'having', 'read', 'negative', 'copy', 'film', 'keep', 'mind', 'well', 'open', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'something', 'rather', 'good', 'gay', 'based', 'film']",Elliot Loves
