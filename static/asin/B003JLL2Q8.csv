1347563,A2A2SUY3IOQKY1,B003JLL2Q8,TawnTawn,"[0, 0]","Amanda (Meredith Baxter) has a perfect life and is a wonderful woman. She has a beautiful house, two wonderful sons, and a hard-working husband. Her best friend Joan (Swoosie Kurtz) is a widow who has a daughter, Dana, who apparently has had a nervous breakdown? Broke up with a boyfriend? Dropped out of college? Or just didn't go back when college started the next semester? Anyway, Amanda's husband, Rob, has given Dana an internship at his firm.SPOILERSFor some reason, although Dana used to take naps as child in Rob's and Amanda's marital bed, and also used to babysit their boys, she and Rob begin an affair. No one knows or suspects, except Rob's boss. Rob (says he) works late all the time and is always coming up with excuses. Proving that they are both very, very stupid, Rob goes to Dana's house (Joan's house) to fool around with her, and guess what? Joan comes home, to her house. What a surprise!Joan is very angry, and tells Dana to get out of her house, which she does not. She keeps living with and off of Mommy. Joan tries to tell Amanda, but can't get the words out. Rob finally tells Amanda that he's having an affair (she catches him crying and pries it out of him), but doesn't tell her who the other woman is. Finally it's out in the open that the other woman is Dana, and Amanda and one of her boys are furious. The other boy is kind of laid-back, and his dad is going to buy him a car, so he has a kind of ""wait and see"" attitude.The furious son confronts Dana (he had wanted to date her) and she cries when he talks about all the people she has hurt. Dana doesn't really care about the others and what her choices have done to them; you can tell she's only crying because she's feeling sorry for herself. She then happily meets Rob again at the hotel room, ready to continue. Rob has had a quick change of heart though, and all of a sudden, realizes what he stands to lose.He tries to get back with Amanda, and she tells him he betrayed her and lied to her. He says everyone lies, so get used to it, but now he is being honest (that must have been difficult). He really doesn't get it, or care to get it. He's just thinking of himself and trying to get back what he had. He doesn't empathize with Amanda and what he's has chosen to do to their marriage, and to Amanda's belief system.However, Amanda must have considered being on her own, and decides to forgive Rob; she says she knows he's sorry. That makes everything okay. She asks how she will be able to trust him again and he has no answer for that. He tells her he missed her and he loves her (now that he's not with Dana anymore). He wasn't missing her or loving her while he was cheating on her with her best friend's daughter, but if this occurs to Amanda, she doesn't say so.Amanda is angry with Joan, and Joan says everything wrong, so you can't really blame Amanda. Joan has zero interpersonal skills. She tells Amanda to ""Calm down!"" She tells her that she is being irrational, and later, that Amanda had better lower her standards, or they can't be friends. Amanda doesn't like this. She doesn't like being told that her values are wrong and that everything she believed in was wrong, but that doesn't matter to Joan. She has no compassion for Amanda, she is just insistent and persistent, because she wants her friend back, and HER life back the way it was (pretty much as Rob does). Joan is like a child. Are we supposed to believe that Joan's ""pep talk"" to Amanda really made her see things in a new and improved light?This film never gets to the heart of the matter, which is: Why would Dana have an affair with Rob, her mother's best friend's husband? According to Joan, she raised her better than that, but Dana never gives her reason, from which I can only conclude that she is a selfish skank. Why did Rob, supposedly so perfect, fall for Dana, who is younger, but really nothing remarkable? There does not seem to be much going on behind this actor's eyes, so it's difficult to tell. He doesn't seem to go very deep.There is no explanation as to why Rob and Dana felt entitled to do as they pleased. The remorse they felt (if any) was only for themselves, not for those they hurt. They both came across as ""Looking out for Number One."" So we shall never know what that really was about.",1,Let Down,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,4287,"['Amanda', 'Meredith', 'Baxter', 'perfect', 'life', 'wonderful', 'woman', 'beautiful', 'house', 'two', 'wonderful', 'sons', 'hard-working', 'husband', 'best', 'friend', 'Joan', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'widow', 'who', 'daughter', 'Dana', 'who', 'apparently', 'had', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'Broke', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'Dropped', 'college', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'when', 'college', 'started', 'next', 'semester', 'Anyway', 'Amanda', 'husband', 'Rob', 'given', 'Dana', 'internship', 'firm.SPOILERSFor', 'reason', 'Dana', 'used', 'take', 'naps', 'child', 'Rob', 'Amanda', 'marital', 'bed', 'also', 'used', 'babysit', 'boys', 'Rob', 'begin', 'affair', 'one', 'suspects', 'Rob', 'boss', 'Rob', 'late', 'time', 'always', 'coming', 'up', 'excuses', 'Proving', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'stupid', 'Rob', 'Dana', 'house', 'Joan', 'house', 'fool', 'guess', 'what', 'Joan', 'home', 'house', 'What', 'surprise', 'Joan', 'very', 'angry', 'tells', 'Dana', 'get', 'house', 'not', 'living', 'Mommy', 'Joan', 'tell', 'Amanda', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'words', 'out', 'Rob', 'finally', 'Amanda', 'having', 'affair', 'crying', 'pries', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'other', 'woman', 'Finally', 'out', 'open', 'other', 'woman', 'Dana', 'Amanda', 'one', 'boys', 'are', 'furious', 'other', 'boy', 'kind', 'laid-back', 'dad', 'going', 'buy', 'car', 'so', 'kind', 'wait', 'see', 'attitude.The', 'furious', 'son', 'confronts', 'Dana', 'had', 'wanted', 'date', 'when', 'people', 'hurt', 'Dana', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'others', 'what', 'choices', 'have', 'done', 'can', 'tell', 'only', 'crying', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'herself', 'then', 'happily', 'Rob', 'again', 'hotel', 'room', 'ready', 'continue', 'Rob', 'had', 'quick', 'change', 'heart', 'sudden', 'what', 'lose.He', 'tries', 'get', 'back', 'Amanda', 'betrayed', 'lied', 'everyone', 'so', 'get', 'used', 'now', 'being', 'honest', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'really', ""n't"", 'get', 'care', 'get', 'just', 'thinking', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'what', 'had', ""n't"", 'empathize', 'Amanda', 'what', 'chosen', 'do', 'marriage', 'Amanda', 'belief', 'system.However', 'Amanda', 'must', 'have', 'considered', 'being', 'own', 'forgive', 'Rob', 'sorry', 'everything', 'okay', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'trust', 'again', 'answer', 'missed', 'now', 'not', 'Dana', 'anymore', 'was', ""n't"", 'missing', 'loving', 'was', 'cheating', 'best', 'friend', 'daughter', 'Amanda', ""n't"", 'say', 'so.Amanda', 'angry', 'Joan', 'Joan', 'everything', 'wrong', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'blame', 'Amanda', 'Joan', 'zero', 'interpersonal', 'skills', 'Amanda', 'Calm', 'down', 'being', 'irrational', 'later', 'Amanda', 'had', 'better', 'lower', 'standards', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'friends', 'Amanda', ""n't"", 'like', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'told', 'values', 'are', 'wrong', 'everything', 'believed', 'was', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Joan', 'compassion', 'Amanda', 'just', 'insistent', 'persistent', 'friend', 'back', 'HER', 'life', 'back', 'way', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'Rob', 'Joan', 'child', 'Are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'Joan', 'pep', 'talk', 'Amanda', 'really', 'made', 'see', 'things', 'new', 'improved', 'light', 'film', 'never', 'heart', 'matter', 'Why', 'would', 'Dana', 'have', 'affair', 'Rob', 'mother', 'best', 'friend', 'husband', 'According', 'Joan', 'raised', 'better', 'Dana', 'never', 'reason', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'selfish', 'skank', 'Why', 'did', 'Rob', 'supposedly', 'so', 'perfect', 'fall', 'Dana', 'who', 'younger', 'really', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'going', 'actor', 'eyes', 'difficult', 'tell', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'very', 'deep.There', 'explanation', 'why', 'Rob', 'Dana', 'felt', 'entitled', 'do', 'pleased', 'remorse', 'felt', 'was', 'only', 'not', 'hurt', 'came', 'Looking', 'out', 'Number', 'One', 'shall', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'was']",Betrayed: A Story of Three Women
