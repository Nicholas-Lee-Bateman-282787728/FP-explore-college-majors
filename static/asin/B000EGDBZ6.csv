THE RINGER is pretty much mindless light entertainment fare not the cinematic work of art you may have been led to believe. It stars Johnny Knoxville who is used to performing with mentally challenged people. He plays a guy that pretends to be ""special"" so he can compete in the Special Olympics and win. This is kinda hard actually. Of course the premise is absurd. An especially funny moment is when he's outed by the special athletes he's staying with. The real life disabled people that star in the movie were funny and I guess it's OK to laugh when everybody laughs. Bottom line: I'll take a movie like this over MIRACLE AT ST ANNA and most Spike Lee films any time. (WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE was good.

Yet people seem to hate it intensely or love it.The premise is very simple.  It's a story about a generally good person who is forced to do something terrible to help someone, letting the story have the adventure involved in the act while not really promoting it.  That's actually a common plot.  In this case, the unique aspect is that it involves the Special Olympics, but mentally challenged people are not depicted in a negative way as they so often are.  Rather, it merely happens that this story takes place in that setting.Is it noble or touching to to use mentally challenged people in a movie and not insult them?  It's certainly uncommon in hollywood, but beyond that is a matter of opinion I can't convince anyone of either way.But even if it does have value added due to the chosen characters and setting, that doesn't change the fact that, as movies go, this one wasn't all that special.  It sure had some funny parts, but they were spaced well among mediocre parts.  There is a ""lesson"" for the main character, but if we believe the plot setup he didn't really need a moral lesson anyway.Personally, I think it's great that this movie was made and exposes the audience to the idea that these people, though odd to us, can function just as people and have lives, thoughts, personalities, etc.  But once again, the actual movie was about average.The realism of the actors may be debateable, but how many movies are completely realistic?  Virtually every fictional movie involves the assumption that one unreal element could be true, such as a scam, fictional technology, or unusual characters.",3,Standard movie entertainment,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,1731,"['am', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'see', 'extreme', 'differences', 'reviews', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'just', 'decent', 'mildly', 'funny', 'people', 'seem', 'hate', 'intensely', 'love', 'it.The', 'premise', 'very', 'simple', 'story', 'generally', 'good', 'person', 'who', 'forced', 'do', 'something', 'terrible', 'help', 'someone', 'letting', 'story', 'have', 'adventure', 'involved', 'act', 'not', 'really', 'promoting', 'actually', 'common', 'plot', 'case', 'unique', 'aspect', 'Special', 'Olympics', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'depicted', 'negative', 'way', 'so', 'often', 'are', 'Rather', 'merely', 'story', 'place', 'setting.Is', 'noble', 'touching', 'use', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'people', 'movie', 'not', 'insult', 'certainly', 'uncommon', 'hollywood', 'matter', 'opinion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'convince', 'anyone', 'way.But', 'even', 'have', 'value', 'added', 'due', 'chosen', 'characters', 'setting', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'that', 'movies', 'go', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'special', 'sure', 'had', 'funny', 'parts', 'were', 'spaced', 'well', 'mediocre', 'parts', 'lesson', 'main', 'character', 'believe', 'plot', 'setup', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'moral', 'lesson', 'anyway.Personally', 'think', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'audience', 'idea', 'people', 'though', 'odd', 'can', 'function', 'just', 'people', 'have', 'lives', 'thoughts', 'personalities', 'etc', 'once', 'again', 'actual', 'movie', 'was', 'average.The', 'realism', 'actors', 'may', 'be', 'debateable', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'completely', 'realistic', 'Virtually', 'fictional', 'movie', 'assumption', 'one', 'unreal', 'element', 'could', 'be', 'true', 'such', 'scam', 'fictional', 'technology', 'unusual', 'characters']",N/A
972352,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000EGDBZ6,A. Estes,"[6, 6]","""The Ringer"" is the kind of movie where, upon a quick glance, most people would assume is made strictly to shock and offend. Considering the infamous Farrelly Brothers (""There's Something About Mary,"" ""Me, Myself & Irene"") stand by as producers, one could imagine the many cheap-shots this movie would take. Surprisingly, though, it doesn't. And despite the restrictions the movie gives itself, it's quite funny at times. And despite a somewhat predictable plot, it's actually a bit heartwarming and sentimental.Apparently, I'm in the minority of people who actually enjoyed this movie. Then again, I tried not to keep my expectations up too high. For starters, this isn't exactly a Farrelly Brothers movie, so don't go in expecting that type of humor. Sure, it shows up at times, but ""The Ringer"" is more conventional than those movies. Johnny Knoxville (from ""Jackass"") is perfect as Steve, a reluctant participant in the Special Olympics, coerced by his uncle Gary, played by Brian Cox (""Manhunter,"" ""Red Eye""). Steve is forced into the games in part to pay off his uncle's bookies, but also to be able to afford surgery to replace the three severed fingers of the man he hired to mow his lawn. The plot does get a bit ridiculous at points, and you can see Steve's happy-ending with Lynn (Katherine Heigl of ""Bride Of Chucky""), a volunteer at the Olympics, coming miles away. But despite all that, the movie does a good job carrying a message without being condescending or losing it's sense of humor.If you look at the cover of the DVD or read any reviews and feel the urge to be instantly offended, don't. ""The Ringer"" is quite well-done, and actually features many mentally-disabled actors in prominent roles. And if that's not enough for you, it's also flat-out funny. It's simply a good comedy with a decent story and an interesting and original angle. Just don't take it too seriously.",4,"""When The $@&% Did We Get Ice Cream?!""",1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,1894,"['Ringer', 'kind', 'movie', 'where', 'quick', 'glance', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'assume', 'made', 'strictly', 'shock', 'offend', 'Considering', 'infamous', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'Something', 'Mary', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'stand', 'producers', 'one', 'could', 'imagine', 'many', 'cheap-shots', 'movie', 'would', 'take', 'Surprisingly', 'though', ""n't"", 'restrictions', 'movie', 'quite', 'funny', 'times', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'plot', 'actually', 'bit', 'heartwarming', 'sentimental.Apparently', ""'m"", 'minority', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Then', 'again', 'tried', 'not', 'keep', 'expectations', 'up', 'too', 'high', 'starters', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'movie', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'type', 'humor', 'Sure', 'up', 'times', 'Ringer', 'more', 'conventional', 'movies', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'Jackass', 'perfect', 'Steve', 'reluctant', 'participant', 'Special', 'Olympics', 'coerced', 'uncle', 'Gary', 'played', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Manhunter', 'Red', 'Eye', 'Steve', 'forced', 'games', 'part', 'pay', 'off', 'uncle', 'bookies', 'also', 'be', 'able', 'afford', 'surgery', 'replace', 'three', 'severed', 'fingers', 'man', 'hired', 'mow', 'lawn', 'plot', 'get', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'points', 'can', 'see', 'Steve', 'happy-ending', 'Lynn', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Bride', 'Chucky', 'volunteer', 'Olympics', 'coming', 'miles', 'away', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'carrying', 'message', 'being', 'condescending', 'losing', 'sense', 'humor.If', 'look', 'cover', 'DVD', 'read', 'reviews', 'feel', 'urge', 'be', 'instantly', 'offended', 'do', ""n't"", 'Ringer', 'quite', 'well-done', 'actually', 'many', 'mentally-disabled', 'actors', 'prominent', 'roles', 'not', 'enough', 'also', 'flat-out', 'funny', 'simply', 'good', 'comedy', 'decent', 'story', 'interesting', 'original', 'angle', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously']",N/A

972357,A1OIMIU0Q4EQJU,B000EGDBZ6,"Brent Lowrey ""Brent""","[2, 29]","THE RINGERThe concept sounded interesting, Johnny Knoxville pretending to be retarded so he can go fix the special Olympics. I mean I don't care what you say, on paper this sounds interesting and funny. Saying that I was terribly wrong would be a great understatement. I did not approach this film expecting to witness a classic and I wasn't disappointed because I instead witnessed one of the most painful to sit through films I have seen in a couple years.Johnny Knoxville stars as Steve Barker, a average joe with a average job. His boss asks him to fire the local janitor, Steve doesn't have the heart to do it, so he hires the janitor to mow his lawn once a week (this film has already made you want to run out and see it hasn't it). The janitor loses his fingers in a lawn mowing accident and Steve feels responsible.So Steve and his uncle decide to rig the Special Olympics to pay off the hospital bill (for the janitor) by having one of them, Steve (Knoxville), pose as a contestant in the games, hoping to dethrone reigning champion, Jimmy.This film is a catastrophe that relies on retarded people to deliver one liners that are suppose to make the audience laugh. The only problem is that retarded people aren't exactly known for their acting skills and this shows tremendously. This is one of those films that if they were going to make it, then they should have made it raunchy and offensive because the route they took did not work at all. Johnny Knoxville should have stuck with doing MTV shows and stay far far away from an acting career because this film did nothing but drive his career into the ground. During this film all I heard were people in the audience going ""Awww"" when they saw a handicapped person on screen or ""Hes so cute"" when they saw a bug eye retarded guy dancing. This film is nothing more than a promotion for the special Olympics, a rather stupid promotion but none the less a promotion. So if you cant count to 15 and have the IQ of 10 then go catch this film I am sure you will love it, for everyone else stay far far away from this piece of crap.

972358,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000EGDBZ6,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[3, 3]","""The Ringer"" is a ridiculous comedy with a goofy plot and political incorrectness throughout. This movie is daring in that it touches on sensitive ground where many directors and performers would not dare to tread. Making a comedy about most subjects would be ok, but this film pokes fun (sort of) at the Special Olympics with Johnny Knoxville pretending to be mentally challenged and committing the ultimate act of shamefulness by joining the Special Olympics and competing for medals against other, truly disabled athletes.This movie has all the warning signs of a tasteless, shameless, and morally offensive film and when I first watched it, I was expecting the worst. I admit, however, that the film's venture into politically incorrect comedy territory was one of its appeals. Making a movie that could possibly poke fun at the Special Olympics and what it stands for was too outrageous to be true and it convinced me to rent the DVD and find out for myself if it really was a film made with incredible bad taste.What I discovered is The Ringer is not all that offensive after all and in many ways it actually shines a positive light on the Special Olympics and its athletes. Yes, there are the many scenes where Knoxville is walking around with his head tilted, talking and acting like he has a serious disability and these scenes could offend some viewers. But the interesting twist on the whole movie is that Knoxville's ""Jeffy"" character is actually the one person who seems the stupidest and his co- athletes are the ones who seem the brightest. In fact, there is the one scene in the movie where the other athletes confront Knoxville's character because they know he is a fraud. They can see right through his act. ""Jeffy"" is shocked because he assumes that Special Olympics people will be easy to fool but not only is this untrue, they are also very good in competitive sports, causing Knoxville's character to rethink his strategy. What he and his uncle thought would be a cake walk turns out to be a tough competition.The attraction between Knoxville and his co- star is the one subplot to the film and while cute, it isn't essential to the overall picture. Actress Katherine Heigl plays a Special Olympics volunteer who is engaged to actor Zen Gesner. Knoxville's character takes an instant liking to her and he plays on her sympathies to win her affections. After a while, she discovers that ""Jeffy"" isn't the disabled person she thought and she reacts with rage. It is up to Knoxville to win her back, if it can even be done at all. This subplot is ok, but the film could have concentrated entirely on the Special Olympics without any loss in comedic value.Performances in this film are generally ok, with Brian Cox as the standout in the bunch. Johnny Knoxville passes in this role, even though his ""Jeffy"" personification is rather weak. Of course, he is doing an acting role within an acting role so I don't know if we can really blame this on lack of talent. Probably the best performers of all, however, are Edward Barbanell, Nicole Bradley, John Taylor, and others who are actual Special Olympics athletes. They each play a role as a specific character, but since they are actual athletes in the Special Olympics, they add a jolt of reality to the film and their performances are commendable.DVD extras for ""The Ringer"" include deleted scenes, a message from Special Olympics chairman Tim Shriver, special commentary by the director, writer, and some of the performers, and a special feature on the Special Olympics itself. This film actually received a thumbs- up from the Special Olympics- they gave their approval to go ahead with the movie. Even though it is a comedy and it has what seems like a distasteful premise, the movie treats the Olympians with respect.Overall, The Ringer is a silly, slapstick comedy that offers a few funny lines and some ok comedy for the most part while also bringing to the forefront an important organization that deserves some much deserved attention.

Sometimes, like in ""The Other Sister,"" they do a very good job. But with ""The Ringer"" they, for the most part, really missed the boat.The premise of the movie is that a young man named Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville) needs to make some quick money for a medical operation for his friend Stavi. Steve is talked, by his lowlife uncle Gary (Brian Cox), into pretending to be mentally retarded so he can enter and win the Special Olympics thus allowing them to win a big bet. Steve is shortly thereafter discovered to be a ""faker"" by his fellow atheletes, who then begin to train him so he can defeat the reigning Special Olympics champion that they all despise - the arrogant Jimmy Washington. Meanwhile, Steve, now known as ""Jeffy,"" develops an intense romantic fixation on Lynn (Katherine Heigl), a sweet, attractive woman who is volunteering at the Special Olympics. Strangely enough, neither Lynn nor any other staff people ever catch on that ""Jeffy"" is not actually retarded. As someone who has worked in this field for a long time, I can say with assurance that the idea that Steve, a third rate wanna be actor, could just waltz in and pretend to be developmentally disabled with no staff people noticing the difference is completely absurd and takes away any credibility the movie might have in terms of being an accurate depiction of this community. I must admit the movie does have a few good laughs and some parts, especially the dance party, do capture the spirit of what developmentally disabled folks are really all about. But, overall, this movie is quite silly and mostly a failure. By the way, I went to this flick with one of the ""special"" individuals I work with.

They falter here because they give us no real reason to laugh, offensive or not.  Sure, there are some scenes where the `special' kids say and do things funny, but if they weren't on the screen the film would have been a complete dud.  So the story is that Steve (Knoxville) is in a jam.

Then Stavi gets his fingers chopped off in the lawn mower and with no insurance Steve has to come up with the money for the surgery before they will give him back his fingers.  In the meantime Steve's Uncle Gary (Cox) is in a jam with some loan sharks and devises a plan to enter Steve into the Special Olympics and place a bet on him.

What most people seem to be overlooking here, when slamming Johnny Knoxville's completely unconvincing performance as a mentally handicapped man is that that is how the script was wrote.  It's part of the fun of the movie, the only ones smart enough to figure out that he's not really mentally handicapped are the ones that he's there to compete against.All of that aside, Johnny Knoxville is his usual comedic best with the physical slapstick comedy in this film, be it falling from ladders, or in the late night 'training' sessions his new athlete friends put him through.  The romance is a little forced and feels kind of thrown in to appeal to the chick flick crowd, but it still works all right in the film.  Truly, the best part of this film is those showcasing the mentally challenged actors who almost completely steal the show, the funniest dialogue seems to have been reserved for them and they perform it beautifully.To sum it up, if you're just looking for some not too serious fun to pass the time then I highly recommend this film.

Mainly due to the gutsy, absolutely truthful performances of both the five intellectually disabled performers and the actors playing 'Special' Olympians that completely fool you into believing it's ALL real (Bill Chott deserves an Oscar nom, that's how good these guys are)!The fact that any disabled actors were used at all is a huge leap for the mentally challenged community, especially since Hollywood is so disablity-phobic (only pretty people need apply). Luckily, the legitimate Special Olympics has already showed their appreciation by endorsing the film on their website and you should get behind this one too, if only because it's funny as hell!I would have given this comedy four stars just for the Oscar-worthy supporting acting that makes Johnny Knoxville's faux 'Jeffy' so obviously an act. Rather than stick with this obvious 'schtick' the plotline offers a hilarious reversal as the 'real' athletes 'cover' for Jeffy in the hopes that the 'ringer' can get them a little payback against the four-time Summer Games gold medal champ 'Jimmy', played by actual Special Olympian Leonard Flowers, who now has his own limou and entourage.Don't let the lame opening set-up and Brian Cox's hammy overacting as the conniving 'Uncle Gary' dampen your enthusiasm for a true sports movie that really grows on you.

972375,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000EGDBZ6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[18, 20]","Pushover nice guy/dweeb Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville) has to come up with $28,000 to cover the cost of his lawnmower's medical bills. His uncle, who is in serious gambling debt, hits upon the very questionable idea of passing Steve off as retarted, thus qualifying him to compete in the Special Olympics. The disabled athletes, however, pretty quickly figure out that Steve is a poser, but they assist him anyway because of their dislike of arrogant perennial gold medal winner Jimmy Washington (Leonard Flowers). At the same time, Steve tries to win over lovely Special Olympics volunteer Lynn Sheridan (Katherine Heigl), while hilariously undermining her relationship with smarmy fiance David (Zen Gesner).I wasn't sure what to expect going into this film. I haven't really dug Johnny Knoxville in the past (though I liked him in Walking Tall), and I was uncertain as to how he would play this character. Thoughts of Billy Bob Thornton's Willie from Bad Santa ran rampant in my brain. However, The Ringer turns out to be a funny, sweet-natured film, which laughs with the mentally disabled, rather than at them. Knoxville's Steve Barker is a surprisingly sympathetic character:  an inherently decent dude trying to do the right thing, but is trapped into a corner, and ends up doing the wrong thing. While I don't know if I can condone his actions, I do definitely feel for him. Knoxville reveals a vulnerable side that is a mini-revelation. Steve's Special Olympics moniker ""Jeffy Dahmer"" still cracks me up. Katherine Heigl (television's Roswell) is perfectly winsome and very hot as Lynn. The rest of the film cast is also uniformly very good, and is peppered with actual mentally disabled performers. Edward Barbanell (""Billy"") and John Taylor (""Rudy"") are both actors with Down Syndrome. Also, all the extra athletes are genuine Special Olympics athletes.Produced by the wacky Farrelly brothers, The Ringer is irreverent, hilarious, touching and, yes, even a tad inspirational.  But was it maybe too PC? Yeah, I would have to say so. The Farrellys obviously wanted to toe the line with this very chancy topic (the Special Olympics gave their blessings to this film). But, as someone had mentioned, one wonders what kinds of unpolitically-correct stuff was left discarded on the editing floor. Still, this is a very funny, feel-good movie, with a (who woulda thunk it?) very likable lead. Guess I'm gonna have to start watching more Johnny Knoxville.Special Features include:  pretty cool film commentary by director Barry W. Blaustein, producer Peter Farrelly, and actors Johnny Knoxville, Edward Barbanell and John Taylor; a Special Olympics featurette; deleted scenes; ""Let the Games Begin - A Look at The Ringer"" docu-segment; and a message from Special Olympics Chairman Tim Shriver.",4,"Oh My-lanta!

If not, then there is a decent chance you won't like it.Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville) is a good guy who has just been promoted.  Unfortunately, part of his promotion is the responsibility of firing a really nice janitor named Stavi who loves to be elbow-deep in a toilet just a bit too much.  Steven doesn't have the stomach for it, so he offers Stavi a job as a gardener at his apartment complex, with full benefits.  Uh-oh, it's only a matter of time before Stavi decides to get elbow-deep into the bottom of an operating lawnmower, and Steve is forced to find a solution.Enter Steve's low-life uncle Gary (Brian Cox), a gambling degenerate unable to pay his debts.  Uncle Gary gets the brilliant idea to fix the Special Olympics.  It's a sure-fire win, despite what the movie attempts to portray, especially if Steve pretends to be a retarded kid named Jeffy (I can count to potato!).  This is where the first bit of comedy comes into play.  Steve experiments with several looks, speech problems, and oddball details as he refines the Jeffy persona.I know it's not right to laugh at retarded people, but I wouldn't be honest if I said it hasn't happened.  And nearly everyone who has seen this movie has done the same to some degree.  Thankfully enough, half of the comedy in this movie is not of the ""laughing at"" variety, but instead, the ""laughing with"" variety.  Although, it must be noted that only a few of the actors were actually mentally handicapped.The biggest problem with this movie is that it attempts to teach a lesson of equality, justice, and opportunity while doing the exact opposite.  It's an attempt to show that competitors in the Special Olympics are just as talented as able-bodied people while making fun of them.  Forgive me for being non-PC, but the preaching is a load of crap.  If this movie took place in real life, Steve would have swept the entire Olympics as Jeffy, smoking Jimmy - the alleged ""Deion Sanders of retards"" - in every single race.  Aside from that, the contrived love story angle of the movie was unnecessary and felt forced - it was probably simply a reason to cast a hot blonde into a role (Katherine Heigl).So, which is it?  Should I feel bad about laughing, even though scenes were put in the movie for that explicit purpose?  Or should I take heed to the final message of acceptance?  I think I'll go with the former and laugh; after all, if the disabled actors don't have a problem with the movie, consistently showing their self-deprecating senses of humor, then why should I?",4,When the F**K did we get ice cream?!,1211500800,"05 23, 2008",2008,2643,"['know', 'who', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'enjoy', 'brand', 'comedy', 'then', 'movie', 'right', 'alley', 'not', 'then', 'decent', 'chance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'it.Steve', 'Barker', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'promoted', 'Unfortunately', 'part', 'promotion', 'responsibility', 'firing', 'really', 'nice', 'janitor', 'named', 'Stavi', 'who', 'be', 'elbow-deep', 'toilet', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Steven', ""n't"", 'have', 'stomach', 'Stavi', 'job', 'gardener', 'apartment', 'complex', 'full', 'benefits', 'Uh-oh', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'Stavi', 'get', 'elbow-deep', 'bottom', 'operating', 'lawnmower', 'Steve', 'forced', 'find', 'solution.Enter', 'Steve', 'low-life', 'uncle', 'Gary', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'gambling', 'degenerate', 'unable', 'pay', 'debts', 'Uncle', 'Gary', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'fix', 'Special', 'Olympics', 'sure-fire', 'win', 'what', 'movie', 'portray', 'especially', 'Steve', 'be', 'retarded', 'kid', 'named', 'Jeffy', 'can', 'count', 'potato', 'where', 'first', 'bit', 'comedy', 'play', 'Steve', 'several', 'looks', 'speech', 'problems', 'oddball', 'details', 'Jeffy', 'persona.I', 'know', 'not', 'right', 'laugh', 'retarded', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'honest', 'said', ""n't"", 'happened', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'who', 'seen', 'movie', 'done', 'same', 'degree', 'Thankfully', 'enough', 'half', 'comedy', 'movie', 'not', 'laughing', 'variety', 'instead', 'laughing', 'variety', 'must', 'be', 'noted', 'only', 'few', 'actors', 'were', 'actually', 'mentally', 'handicapped.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'teach', 'lesson', 'equality', 'justice', 'opportunity', 'doing', 'exact', 'opposite', 'attempt', 'show', 'competitors', 'Special', 'Olympics', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'talented', 'able-bodied', 'people', 'making', 'fun', 'Forgive', 'being', 'non-PC', 'preaching', 'load', 'crap', 'movie', 'took', 'place', 'real', 'life', 'Steve', 'would', 'have', 'swept', 'entire', 'Olympics', 'Jeffy', 'smoking', 'Jimmy', 'alleged', 'Deion', 'Sanders', 'retards', 'single', 'race', 'Aside', 'contrived', 'love', 'story', 'angle', 'movie', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'felt', 'forced', 'was', 'probably', 'simply', 'reason', 'cast', 'hot', 'blonde', 'role', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', '.So', 'Should', 'feel', 'bad', 'laughing', 'even', 'scenes', 'were', 'put', 'movie', 'explicit', 'purpose', 'should', 'take', 'heed', 'final', 'message', 'acceptance', 'think', ""'ll"", 'go', 'former', 'laugh', 'disabled', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'movie', 'consistently', 'showing', 'self-deprecating', 'senses', 'humor', 'then', 'why', 'should']",N/A

Steve turns to his Uncle Gary (Brian Cox) for help and Gary, who's in some money trouble himself, suggests they rig the Special Olympics. Steve is completely against it, but eventually caves and joins. Steve, now calling himself Jeffy Dahmor with an ""O"" joins the Special Olympics but ends up falling for one of the counselors named Lynn (Katherine Heigl). Things get worse when his fellow competitors realize that Jeffy is a scam, but once he convinces them of what his goal is...They go along with it.Writer Ricky Blitt had a lot of directions he could've gone with this movie, opting for cheap mean jokes on the mentally challenged people. But, amazingly, this movie does not exploit them at all. None of the jokes are mean or prejudice, but the movie is hilariously funny. Besides the ""Jackass"" movies, this is probably the funniest work Knoxville has done. Both the physical humor and otherwise is absolutely hilarious (Barker, is that you?). The love angle between Steve and Lynn is a bit predictable but needed to move the movie along. While, this movie didn't recieve a whole lot of good reviews it's really funny and really entertaining and I'd suggest you don'tt pass up seeing it.GRADE: A",5,Really Funny,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,1885,"['Ringer', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'written', 'Ricky', 'Blitt', 'who', 'one', 'head', 'writers', 'Family', 'Guy', 'movie', 'subject', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'controversial', 'cruel', 'instead', 'complete', 'justice', 'quite', 'few', 'things', 'laugh', 'about.Knoxville', 'plays', 'Steve', 'Barker', 'Steve', 'nice', 'guy', 'when', 'moved', 'up', 'office', 'building', 'first', 'job', 'fire', 'janitor', 'Stavi', 'Luis', 'Avalos', 'Problem', 'Steve', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'instead', 'offers', 'Stavi', '400', 'month', 'mow', 'lawn', 'When', 'Stavi', 'accidentally', 'fingers', 'lawnmower', 'accident', 'Steve', 'get', '28,000', 'dollars', 'pay', 'surgery', 'sew', 'fingers', 'back', 'Steve', 'Uncle', 'Gary', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'help', 'Gary', 'who', 'money', 'trouble', 'rig', 'Special', 'Olympics', 'Steve', 'completely', 'eventually', 'caves', 'joins', 'Steve', 'now', 'calling', 'Jeffy', 'Dahmor', 'O', 'Special', 'Olympics', 'up', 'falling', 'one', 'counselors', 'named', 'Lynn', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Things', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'fellow', 'competitors', 'realize', 'Jeffy', 'scam', 'once', 'what', 'goal', 'go', 'along', 'it.Writer', 'Ricky', 'Blitt', 'had', 'lot', 'directions', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'movie', 'opting', 'cheap', 'mean', 'jokes', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'people', 'amazingly', 'movie', 'not', 'exploit', 'None', 'jokes', 'are', 'mean', 'prejudice', 'movie', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'Jackass', 'movies', 'probably', 'funniest', 'work', 'Knoxville', 'done', 'physical', 'humor', 'otherwise', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'Barker', 'love', 'angle', 'Steve', 'Lynn', 'bit', 'predictable', 'needed', 'move', 'movie', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'recieve', 'whole', 'lot', 'good', 'reviews', 'really', 'funny', 'really', 'entertaining', ""'d"", 'suggest', ""don'tt"", 'pass', 'up', 'seeing', 'it.GRADE']",N/A

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 2]","Although I'm not a big fan of Johnny Knoxville, I have to admit that I admired the effort that he, Brian Cox, Katherine Heigl, and the many Special Olympians put into this flick.  The story is farfetched, but manages to work as a comedy.  Knoxville's uncle (Cox), has run into trouble with his bookie.  Knoxville, hoping to be a good Samaritan, hired the janitor he was told to fire as the lawnkeeper at his apartment complex.  He lies to the janitor and tells him that he'll have insurance.  Of course, the man cuts off two of his fingers and Knoxville takes him to the hospital.  Without any real insurance, Knoxville has to come up with the money to pay for the surgery to re-attach his friend's fingers.  He and Cox come up with a plan to rig the Special Olympics and bet against star Olympian Jimmy to win the games.  It sounds flawless, right?Knoxville doesn't expect some of these athletes to be as good as they actually are.  They figure him out as a fake but use him to their advantage against the cocky Jimmy.  Knoxville also falls for one of the volunteers at the game (Heigl), and has to figure out how he can reveal the truth behind her boyfriend AND convince her to fall for him instead.Great care is taken to avoid any slighting or insults of the Olympians.  Some of the characters are played by actors without disabilities, especially a couple of the key athletes.  The rest of the cast does a brilliant job and are actually funnier than Knoxville.The Farrelly brothers produced ""The Ringer,"" but it lacks a lot of the bite that you find in other films that they've had a hand in such as ""Stuck On You"" and ""Something About Mary.""

I've admired some elements of the smaller films (Daltry Calhoun, Grand Theft Parsons) that he's done to extend his acting cred, but have found most of his ""blockbuster"" work (Dukes, Walking Tall) to be passable, at best, and excruciating, at worst.  I'll admit, I was not first in line to see ""The Ringer.""  The concept of Knoxville going undercover as a participant in the Special Olympics seemed like a disaster waiting to happen.  In this world of political correctness, even the hint of impropriety threatens to derail questionable projects (much to my chagrin, most of the time), so I just didn't see how it was possible that this story was going to be made.  But made it was, and with the full cooperation of the Special Olympics!With minimal expectations, I actually found ""The Ringer"" to be very funny and filled with heart.  Without a question, I feel this is Johnny Knoxville's best screen performance to date.  He's wickedly funny, surprisingly sympathetic, and a credible romantic lead all rolled into one.  In a scheme that is entered into with good intentions, Knoxville infiltrates the Special Olympics with the help of his uncle (a hysterically dark turn from Brian Cox).  There, he finds it much more challenging than he had anticipated--both physically in the sporting events and mentally as it's difficult to maintain his cover.  Of course, it doesn't help matters that he falls for a lovely volunteer (natch) played by ""Grey's Anatomy""'s Katherine Heigl.Of course, much of the humor is physical and much might be considered offensive in certain camps.  I, for one, found it refreshing that the other participants of the Olympics were not portrayed as ""saints"" but as real people.  The front-runner, for example, is an outright villain. And when Knoxville is set up on a blind date with a disabled girl, she is dismissive and irritable and downright mean.  It's a progressive and unusual view, as most movies on this subject show exclusively favorable characterizations.  Knoxville's plot against Heigl's boyfriend is hysterical, his camaraderie in the group is fresh and believable, and his romantic inclinations are well-played.With moments of what seem like mean-spirited humor, this is actually a sweet and respectful picture.  I think most people expected a bit more of the gross-out humor found in early Farrelly Brother's pictures.  This is a slightly more conventional picture that the inspired ""There's Something About Mary""--but I was shocked and delighted by how much I actually liked ""The Ringer.""

As Uncle Gary sees it, Jeffy's only competition is a guy named Jimmy who has won the competition the last six years in a row.The most ridiculous thing about this film was that it seemed the main qualification for being mentally challenged is the annoying habit of talking about oneself in the third person.  Other than that the film makers make every effort to diffuse the backlash from those who will say they're making fun of the mentally handicapped.

While this flick isn't in the same catagory as pictures like ""Cool Runnings"", it has plenty of charm and enjoyable characters to make it worth watching.  Johnny Knoxville leads the cast as a young man who feels unfufilled in his job and life who is faced with a dellemma when a friend of his loses several fingers on his watch.  With no money to pay for the reattachment, Knoxville conspires with his scheming, wannabe ""hood"" uncle, played by Brian Cox, to fix the Special Olympics (has that ever actually happened?)  While the uncle goes and places the appropriate bets, Mr. Knoxville inflirts the Special Olympics as a highly-functioning mentally-impaired man.  There he befriends several actually mentally-impaired competitors (seriously, I think some of the actors were actually mentally-impaired.)  He also meets and falls for one of the volunteers, played by Katherine Heigl.  However, he is plagued by two problems when it comes to his love interest:  1, she's engaged to another guy, and 2, as Mr. Cox, she thinks he's mentally impaired...I think that was Mr. Cox's only valid point throughout the film.  Personally, I think Mr. Cox is a great, intelligent actor, so I'm writing the uncle's lack of intelligence off as an atribution to that talent.  I do wonder what bookie in his right mind would take bets on the Special Olympics.  Anyway, this is a charming film that was approved of by the Special Olympics program itself.
