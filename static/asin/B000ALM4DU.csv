927719,AFQSY113LM5Y5,B000ALM4DU,British History Buff,"[0, 0]","Totally excited at finding a film with Judi Dench and Michael Williams - story sounded good, etc. Started watching and couldn't wait until it ended. Dame Dench's performance is stilted as though it is her first time in front of a camera. The film quality is poor and on and on. The one outstanding bright light in the film is Michael Williams who performs at the top of his craft and totally outshines the rest of the company without up-staging anyone.Interested in Dame Judi and Michael Williams together - try 'A Fine Romance' - it takes a little adjusting to as both main characters are basically at the back of the pack. But give it a chance and it can become a favorite worth repeated watching - especially the Dame Judi and Michael Williams screen relationship.",2,"Really, really bad",1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,767,"['Totally', 'excited', 'finding', 'film', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Michael', 'Williams', 'story', 'sounded', 'good', 'etc', 'Started', 'watching', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'ended', 'Dame', 'Dench', 'performance', 'stilted', 'first', 'time', 'front', 'camera', 'film', 'quality', 'poor', 'one', 'outstanding', 'bright', 'light', 'film', 'Michael', 'Williams', 'who', 'top', 'craft', 'totally', 'rest', 'company', 'up-staging', 'anyone.Interested', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Michael', 'Williams', 'together', 'try', 'Fine', 'Romance', 'little', 'adjusting', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'basically', 'back', 'pack', 'give', 'chance', 'can', 'become', 'favorite', 'worth', 'repeated', 'watching', 'especially', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Michael', 'Williams', 'screen', 'relationship']",N/A

927724,A5C3TXUS2NEZK,B000ALM4DU,LadyBelle,"[26, 26]","I bought this because I was interested to see what one of my favorite performers looked like as a younger woman (Dame Judi Dench), and to also see her in a movie with her husband (Michael Williams). The story was interesting to say the least, but I will not tell because I do not want to ruin it for anybody who has not seen it. I will just say that this is a great movie with a plot that will shock the viewer in the end. It is fun to watch these two play in a film together, they were only married for about 4 years when this was made. Judi Dench and Michael Williams are fantastic actors, but I have to say that Michael William's performance out shines his wife's in this(also see them both together in a funny comedy entitled ""A Fine Romance"")!",5,Great movie!,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,748,"['bought', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'one', 'favorite', 'performers', 'looked', 'younger', 'woman', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'also', 'see', 'movie', 'husband', 'Michael', 'Williams', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'say', 'least', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'ruin', 'anybody', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'great', 'movie', 'plot', 'will', 'shock', 'viewer', 'end', 'fun', 'watch', 'two', 'play', 'film', 'together', 'were', 'only', 'married', '4', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Michael', 'Williams', 'are', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'have', 'say', 'Michael', 'William', 'performance', 'shines', 'wife', 'also', 'see', 'together', 'funny', 'comedy', 'entitled', 'Fine', 'Romance']",N/A
