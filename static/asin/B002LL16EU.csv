1276560,A1DB4U8ISVULVE,B002LL16EU,Bill Smith,"[3, 18]","When it comes right down to it, Bewitched is truly a tale of two Dicks. Dick Sargent and Dick York. Ultimately the viewer must choose which Dick he or she prefers, as Darren. Its obvious from watching this series that Elizabeth Montgomery (Samantha) enjoyed working with both Dicks, and was very good at stroking thier huge egos. In this I agree with the expert, Franky Murillo. Its obvious she really worked hard at getting both Dicks to feel comfortable on the set so they wouldn't give any flaccid performances. She was able to handle both Dicks very skillfully, which helped the Series grow to its full potential. Its not an easy job to do, and its obvious she had her hands full at times. I think she preferred the first Dick over the second Dick, simply because he was bigger, in terms of stature. It would have been funny to have an episode in which both Dicks appeared at the same time, to see what kind of ramifications that would have brought. A double Dick episode you would have thought was a no brainer for this series, especially in Season 8. I think the viewer got shafted in not being able to see such an episode, but that's show biz I guess. Ultimately I found the second Dick a bit too stiff and lifeless in his role. Just didn't think he was penetrating enough to really make his mark. I thought the first Dick was much more animated and flexible in many ways, and when he got angry he turned real bright red. I have to hand it to both Dicks though, York and Sargent, they really exploded onto the sitcom scene back then, in roles that could have been embarrassing. Both Dicks really grew into their roles well, and inflated the value of the series, swelling the audience. While some of their antics were a little premature in terms of timing, both of them ultimately rose to the occasion in their own ways, and for that we fans of both wonderful Dicks are grateful.I have searched long and hard on the internet for this stuff, and its so gratifying to find these TV shows featuring both these Dicks in these Bewitched Box Sets!",3,A Tale of Two Dicks---York and Sargent,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,2047,"['When', 'right', 'down', 'Bewitched', 'truly', 'tale', 'two', 'Dicks', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'Dick', 'York', 'Ultimately', 'viewer', 'must', 'choose', 'Dick', 'prefers', 'Darren', 'obvious', 'watching', 'series', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'Samantha', 'enjoyed', 'working', 'Dicks', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'stroking', 'thier', 'huge', 'egos', 'agree', 'expert', 'Franky', 'Murillo', 'obvious', 'really', 'worked', 'hard', 'getting', 'Dicks', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'set', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'flaccid', 'performances', 'was', 'able', 'handle', 'Dicks', 'very', 'skillfully', 'helped', 'Series', 'grow', 'full', 'potential', 'not', 'easy', 'job', 'do', 'obvious', 'had', 'full', 'times', 'think', 'preferred', 'first', 'Dick', 'second', 'Dick', 'simply', 'was', 'bigger', 'terms', 'stature', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'have', 'episode', 'Dicks', 'appeared', 'same', 'time', 'see', 'what', 'kind', 'ramifications', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'double', 'Dick', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'brainer', 'series', 'especially', 'Season', '8', 'think', 'viewer', 'got', 'shafted', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'such', 'episode', 'show', 'biz', 'guess', 'Ultimately', 'found', 'second', 'Dick', 'bit', 'too', 'stiff', 'lifeless', 'role', 'Just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'penetrating', 'enough', 'really', 'make', 'mark', 'thought', 'first', 'Dick', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'animated', 'flexible', 'many', 'ways', 'when', 'got', 'angry', 'turned', 'real', 'bright', 'red', 'have', 'hand', 'Dicks', 'York', 'Sargent', 'really', 'exploded', 'sitcom', 'scene', 'back', 'then', 'roles', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'embarrassing', 'Dicks', 'really', 'grew', 'roles', 'well', 'inflated', 'value', 'series', 'swelling', 'audience', 'antics', 'were', 'little', 'premature', 'terms', 'timing', 'ultimately', 'rose', 'occasion', 'own', 'ways', 'fans', 'wonderful', 'Dicks', 'are', 'grateful.I', 'have', 'searched', 'long', 'hard', 'internet', 'stuff', 'so', 'gratifying', 'find', 'TV', 'shows', 'featuring', 'Dicks', 'Bewitched', 'Box']",N/A

Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) is a hardworking wife, mother and a daughter who tries to play fair to her husband, Darrin (Dick York/Dick Sargent), daughter Tabitha (Erin Murphy), and mother Endora (Agnes Moorhead). Being a witch, she promises to Darrin that she will not use her (witchy) powers in the family. But practically this becomes impossible since her mother Endora who strongly despises Darrin, interferes in his personal and professional life, and at the end Samantha has to intervene and undo the damages done. Many episodes begin with Darrin becoming the victim of a spell, and it usually affects his boss, Larry (David White) and his clients, and the nosy neighbor, Mrs. Kravitz (Alice Pearce, Sandra Gould) and her husband Abner (George Tobias). Over the years I have seen many episodes on TV Land cable channel and enjoyed immensely. It has been tradition in my family to watch the Christmas episodes and Thanksgiving episodes during the holiday season. There are five Christmas shows and only one Thanksgiving episode. The thanksgiving episode is one of the best episodes of the series. Other episodes that I highly recommend are, in addition to all Christmas episodes; from season 4; ""Hippie, Hippie, Hooray."" In this story, Cousin Serena has become an ultra-hip girl and is arrested at a love-in, which makes the front page of the newspaper. Larry and Louise think it is Samantha in the photograph, making for another confusing dinner party at the Stephens' home with one of McMann and Tate's clients. From season 2; ""Divided He Falls,"" Samantha wants to go to Miami, but Darrin is too busy with work. Endora then splits Darrin in two (one serious, one playful) so that Samantha can take her vacation with playful Darrin, and she become tired of his fun side, while Larry and a client become annoyed by his overly serious side. From season 3; ""The Trial and Error of Aunt Clara,"" Samantha's living room is turned into a courtroom so that Samantha could defend Aunt Clara against a coven who wants her earthbound. The show saw a major change when Dick York left the show and he was replaced by Dick Sargent.

I first heard of ""I Dream of Jeannie"" (1965-1970) a fantasy sitcom in itselft, which some say is just a mockery of ""Bewitched"" but it isn't!!!!Anyways, let's get back to my ""Bewitched"" review shall we? When I looked it up on Wikipedia, I was so surprised to see how popular this fantasy riot was back in the 1960s. This series ranked #2 during the 1964/65 season (its first season); ranking only behind ""Bonanza"". The series aired in B&W; for its first two seasons, and it ranked 7th for its second year. Season three brings a switch to color, higher productions, and slipping ratings. Though it still ranked 7th for its third year, its ratings had slipped.For its fourth and fifth seasons, the series ranked 11th overall, however, ratings still dropped. In the show's sixth season, with Darrin now played by Dick Sargent, ratings dropped to #24 for the season. By the end of its prime time run, ""Bewitched"" ranked 72nd, one of the top 15 least watched TV shows on TV at the time.However, I must admit that ""Bewitched"" does have good humor. It does, however, repeat several other popular episodes from ""I Love Lucy"" and other classical sitcoms. In the final season of ""Bewitched"" there are 8 remade episodes from previous seasons! This should've told writters that the show was burning out.... Hello, ratings were now at the bottom of the charts, and they couldn't think of nothing else to write for our beloved Samantha and Darrin.... and let's not forget Tabitha and the wicked Endora.Nevertheless, I think that this would be an excellent ""Complete Series"" collection to order. I would also suggest ordering the complete series of ""Gilligan's Island"" and ""I Dream of Jeannie"" and maybe even ""The Addams Family"". Why.... you may ask? Because these are wholesome, non-violent, no-sexual shows with no cussing, sex, or even sexual aimed themes.... just down-to-Earth fun and humor! Enjoy this if you purchase!

Easier to ship as the whole series is shrinkwrapped, and would be less likely to have discs get loose inside their packages.  My set arrived without issue.""Bewitched"" is a surprisingly clean and innocent 60s sitcom, with the premise of a mortal marrying a witch (Hollywood's version of a witch, not based on historical or real-life witchcraft, because the show would be far different and would offer nothing of humor for Paul Lynde...)  Indeed, the show is great early on, especially as Samantha keeps trying to prove to mother that Darrin is one of the good mortals that is open-minded; the Halloween episode from season 2 is probably a good episode to start people with (or any with Uncle Arthur...)Paul Lynde was only in ten episodes, which is unfortunate as he stole the show - every time.All the principal actors treat their material with such veracity that I can believe the silly proceedings.Later years do get more risque at times (e.g. toward the end of the show's run, Paul Lynde is in an episode where - at a children's party - he gets a spell wrong and conjures up a woman dressed like a bunny instead of a real bunny appearing.  Kids would appreciate the mistake for it going wrong, but adults - especially the dads - will appreciate it for rather a different reason (or two...)  but the show is still riotously funny, if you can get into it and roll along with it.I will nitpick, though, in that ""warlock""'s original meaning was of Scottish origin and is the name of a person that breaks an oath or covenant.  Somewhere along the line of history somebody thought to replace the gender-neutral ""witch"" with ""warlock"".  I tend to be a fan of original word meanings, and many words to change meaning over time, but keeping in mind that the show was not made to insult or hurt anyone per se, it's easily overlooked.As for DVD quality:Pros:------Colorization:  I normally prefer the black and white originals, but the people that did this work did a fairly good job at tricking the eye.  Some scenes have me doing a double-take.  I can still tell the differences between real color and colorizaton (hint - gray or white hair isn't even given a color cast, some skin tones are too saturated, and some coats (or skin color, especially by white hair) look like they're in 3D because the applied color didn't (or can't) match the darker tone of the original b/w print) but, for colorization, an A- grade seems not unreasonable.Sound quality is excellent, given the media of the time.  Grade: ACons:------Many seasons (season 3 stands out) being of very poor quality - much film grain and other distortion lowers image quality.  There was obviously color restoration done, but not much else.  Grade, depends on the season but on average:  C+Keep in mind that larger TVs (40""+) will show the DVD compression artifacts, poor source quality, etc, far more readily than smaller sets.  And these shows were originally seen on sets no larger than 24"" (often 20"" or smaller).  I'm surprised they were made on 35mm film, not 16mm, but the fact they're done on 35mm means that a good restoration process could make them look flawless AND candidates for a Blu-Ray release.Definitely purchasing, if you're a big fan of the show.  Otherwise stick with season sets sold separately, or if you hate the show then there's no need to buy.",4,Mixed bag,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,3454,"['seemed', 'easier', 'buy', 'whole', 'set', 'one', 'go', 'click', 'season', 'set', 'net', 'savings', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'roughly', '5', 'Easier', 'ship', 'whole', 'series', 'shrinkwrapped', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'likely', 'have', 'discs', 'get', 'loose', 'packages', 'set', 'arrived', 'issue', 'Bewitched', 'surprisingly', 'clean', 'innocent', '60s', 'sitcom', 'premise', 'mortal', 'marrying', 'witch', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'witch', 'not', 'based', 'historical', 'real-life', 'witchcraft', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'different', 'would', 'offer', 'nothing', 'humor', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'Indeed', 'show', 'great', 'early', 'especially', 'Samantha', 'trying', 'prove', 'mother', 'Darrin', 'one', 'good', 'mortals', 'open-minded', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'season', '2', 'probably', 'good', 'episode', 'start', 'people', 'Uncle', 'Arthur', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'was', 'only', 'ten', 'episodes', 'unfortunate', 'stole', 'show', 'time.All', 'principal', 'actors', 'treat', 'material', 'such', 'veracity', 'can', 'believe', 'silly', 'proceedings.Later', 'years', 'do', 'get', 'more', 'risque', 'times', 'e.g', 'end', 'show', 'run', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'episode', 'where', 'children', 'party', 'spell', 'wrong', 'up', 'woman', 'dressed', 'bunny', 'instead', 'real', 'bunny', 'appearing', 'Kids', 'would', 'appreciate', 'mistake', 'going', 'wrong', 'adults', 'especially', 'dads', 'will', 'appreciate', 'rather', 'different', 'reason', 'two', 'show', 'still', 'riotously', 'funny', 'can', 'get', 'roll', 'along', 'it.I', 'will', 'nitpick', 'though', 'warlock', 'original', 'meaning', 'was', 'Scottish', 'origin', 'name', 'person', 'oath', 'covenant', 'Somewhere', 'line', 'history', 'somebody', 'thought', 'replace', 'gender-neutral', 'witch', 'warlock', 'tend', 'be', 'fan', 'original', 'word', 'meanings', 'many', 'words', 'change', 'meaning', 'time', 'keeping', 'mind', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'insult', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'se', 'easily', 'overlooked.As', 'DVD', 'quality', 'Pros', 'Colorization', 'normally', 'prefer', 'black', 'white', 'originals', 'people', 'did', 'work', 'did', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'tricking', 'eye', 'scenes', 'have', 'doing', 'double-take', 'can', 'still', 'tell', 'differences', 'real', 'color', 'colorizaton', 'hint', 'gray', 'white', 'hair', ""n't"", 'even', 'given', 'color', 'cast', 'skin', 'tones', 'are', 'too', 'saturated', 'coats', 'skin', 'color', 'especially', 'white', 'hair', 'look', ""'re"", '3D', 'applied', 'color', 'did', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'darker', 'tone', 'original', 'b/w', 'print', 'colorization', 'A-', 'grade', 'not', 'unreasonable.Sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'given', 'media', 'time', 'Grade', 'ACons', 'Many', 'seasons', 'season', '3', 'out', 'being', 'very', 'poor', 'quality', 'much', 'film', 'grain', 'other', 'distortion', 'lowers', 'image', 'quality', 'was', 'obviously', 'color', 'restoration', 'done', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Grade', 'season', 'average', 'C+Keep', 'mind', 'larger', 'TVs', '40', '+', 'will', 'show', 'DVD', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'poor', 'source', 'quality', 'etc', 'far', 'more', 'readily', 'smaller', 'sets', 'shows', 'were', 'originally', 'seen', 'sets', 'no', 'larger', '24', 'often', '20', 'smaller', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'were', 'made', '35mm', 'film', 'not', '16mm', 'fact', ""'re"", 'done', '35mm', 'means', 'good', 'restoration', 'process', 'could', 'make', 'look', 'flawless', 'AND', 'candidates', 'Blu-Ray', 'release.Definitely', 'purchasing', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'Otherwise', 'stick', 'season', 'sets', 'sold', 'separately', 'hate', 'show', 'then', 'need', 'buy']",N/A
