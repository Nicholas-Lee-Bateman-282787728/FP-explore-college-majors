It apparently is a light-weight, no name cast, early '40s film - the kind of thing I might pick up in a $1.00 DVD bin.

The cast and production is very good - Eric Blore is absolutely great in this.  The story is fairly standard Hollywood fare but the characters in this are interesting.  I bought this because I had seen the movie years ago and I enjoyed it.  The copy provided by Reel Enterprises appears to be from 16mm and is very adequate - a lot better than most of the 1.00 movies I've ever bought. I would not put it into the same category as the 1.00 movies.I do have a ""beef"" with Reel Enterprises - and actually my reason for only the 3 star rating.  Like so many of the smaller companies providing public domain movies, they feel they have to protect their ""turf"" by superimposing their logo on the screen during the movie. Many of us buy these movies to get away from this type of ""advertising"" from broadcast  and some cable offerings. We don't want it in the movies we buy.I won't purchase any more from Reel Enterprises because of this - or at least until they decide to remove the logos from their prints.  Some larger companies have removed them because of complaints - others should take the ""hint"". I can recommend the movie but not from this supplier.",3,Non-mushy love story - not sci-fi - Movie defaced with logo...,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,1301,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'interest', 'only', 'small', 'audience', 'however', 'nice', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'like', 'light', 'love', 'stories', 'cast', 'production', 'very', 'good', 'Eric', 'Blore', 'absolutely', 'great', 'story', 'fairly', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'bought', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'enjoyed', 'copy', 'provided', 'Reel', 'Enterprises', 'be', '16mm', 'very', 'adequate', 'lot', 'better', 'most', '1.00', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'bought', 'would', 'not', 'put', 'same', 'category', '1.00', 'movies.I', 'do', 'have', 'beef', 'Reel', 'Enterprises', 'actually', 'reason', 'only', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'so', 'many', 'smaller', 'companies', 'providing', 'public', 'domain', 'movies', 'feel', 'have', 'protect', 'turf', 'superimposing', 'logo', 'screen', 'movie', 'Many', 'buy', 'movies', 'get', 'away', 'type', 'advertising', 'broadcast', 'cable', 'offerings', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'movies', 'buy.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'more', 'Reel', 'Enterprises', 'least', 'decide', 'remove', 'logos', 'prints', 'larger', 'companies', 'have', 'removed', 'complaints', 'others', 'should', 'take', 'hint', 'can', 'recommend', 'movie', 'not', 'supplier']",N/A

And, although I am not familiar with most of the actors, they are competent.  And I'd buy a movie with Eric Blore in it anytime.Sweet story, it is a casual rom-com romp with spoiled rich kid developing maturity with the help of a scandalized woman and a poetry spewing servant.It takes the woman some time to warm up to the spoiled rich kid, that is her quote to title this review.  I plan to use it sometime.I give it 5 stars because it is all it should be.
