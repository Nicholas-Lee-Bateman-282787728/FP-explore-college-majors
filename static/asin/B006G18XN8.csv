1514860,ATJ47ZS435GZT,B006G18XN8,liz56,"[0, 0]","My child has been watching the entire Baby Babble series since he was about a year old. He is 17 months old now and many of his first words (SPEAKING words, not just sign language) have come from watching these videos. Words like baby, daddy, mommy, up, down, out, more, truck, please, thank you, all done, eat, and countless others. The videos are designed to hold the short attention span of young children, and they definitely do. The intervals of music, incorporation of sounds, talking, simple objects, etc. ---all of those are specifically directed toward babies and toddlers. In my opinion, this series is better than Baby Einstein, Brainy Baby, etc. for the older baby/young toddler. It might be ""too educational"" for the really young baby. But, from 9 months to age 2 1/2 or maybe even older, I would say this series is THE BEST out there for speech, learning, and ""quiet time."". The series even focuses on certain letters like p,b, and m or t, d, n which directly coincides with the appropriate level of speech that a child is capable of learning as he/she grows. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENTIRE BABY BABLE SERIES (There are 3 in the series.) Oh and as an added benefit, the videos are quite calming for the parents and the creators' approach toward teaching the concepts is actually quite fascinating.  A nice break from some of the ""annoying"" shows and DVDs that are out there for kids. And an overall great way to expose your child to language/learning. One of the best products we invested in during my son's first year and a half of life for sure.",5,"excellent, buy it now!",1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,1560,"['child', 'been', 'watching', 'entire', 'Baby', 'Babble', 'series', 'was', 'year', 'old', '17', 'months', 'old', 'now', 'many', 'first', 'words', 'SPEAKING', 'words', 'not', 'just', 'sign', 'language', 'have', 'come', 'watching', 'videos', 'Words', 'baby', 'daddy', 'mommy', 'up', 'down', 'out', 'more', 'truck', 'please', 'thank', 'done', 'eat', 'countless', 'others', 'videos', 'are', 'designed', 'hold', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'young', 'children', 'definitely', 'do', 'intervals', 'music', 'incorporation', 'sounds', 'talking', 'simple', 'objects', 'etc', '-all', 'are', 'specifically', 'directed', 'babies', 'toddlers', 'opinion', 'series', 'better', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'Brainy', 'Baby', 'etc', 'older', 'baby/young', 'toddler', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'educational', 'really', 'young', 'baby', '9', 'months', 'age', '2', '1/2', 'maybe', 'even', 'older', 'would', 'say', 'series', 'THE', 'BEST', 'there', 'speech', 'learning', 'quiet', 'time.', 'series', 'even', 'certain', 'letters', 'p', 'b', 'm', 't', 'd', 'n', 'directly', 'appropriate', 'level', 'speech', 'child', 'capable', 'learning', 'he/she', 'HIGHLY', 'THE', 'ENTIRE', 'BABY', 'BABLE', 'SERIES', 'are', '3', 'series', 'Oh', 'added', 'benefit', 'videos', 'are', 'quite', 'calming', 'parents', 'creators', 'approach', 'teaching', 'concepts', 'actually', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'nice', 'break', 'annoying', 'shows', 'DVDs', 'are', 'there', 'kids', 'overall', 'great', 'way', 'expose', 'child', 'language/learning', 'One', 'best', 'products', 'invested', 'son', 'first', 'year', 'half', 'life', 'sure']",Baby Babble 3 - T D N

(And includes more parent tips)Baby Babble 3 Focuses on the T, D, and N sounds, called Alveolar sounds, because your tongue touches the bumpy ridge behind your teeth when you say the T, D, And N sounds.Again great quality DVD, Cory and Amy (the Speech Pathologists who made this series) added new fun toys, and the DVD is made in the same format as the first two. New for this DVD, they Started adding 2-3 word phrases.My boys focused on it the first time I showed it, and were interacting with this DVD just as they did the first two!I HIGHLY Recommend this series!!!",5,Just as great as the first two DVD's,1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,891,"['DVD', '3rd', 'series', 'Baby', 'Babble.Each', 'DVD', 'speech', 'development', 'progression.Baby', 'Babble', 'vocabulary', 'kid', 'portion', 'DVD', 'great', 'parent', 'tutorial.Baby', 'Babble', '2', 'Focuses', 'P', 'B', 'M', 'called', 'Bilabial', 'made', 'lips', 'front', 'mouth', 'more', 'parent', 'tips', 'Baby', 'Babble', '3', 'Focuses', 'T', 'D', 'N', 'called', 'Alveolar', 'sounds', 'tongue', 'bumpy', 'ridge', 'teeth', 'when', 'say', 'T', 'D', 'N', 'sounds.Again', 'great', 'quality', 'DVD', 'Cory', 'Amy', 'Speech', 'Pathologists', 'who', 'made', 'series', 'added', 'new', 'fun', 'toys', 'DVD', 'made', 'same', 'format', 'first', 'two', 'New', 'DVD', 'Started', 'adding', '2-3', 'word', 'phrases.My', 'boys', 'focused', 'first', 'time', 'showed', 'were', 'interacting', 'DVD', 'just', 'did', 'first', 'two', 'HIGHLY', 'Recommend', 'series']",Baby Babble 3 - T D N

We watch them several times a week and she really watches and pay attention to them. This 3rd disc is a little too advanced for her attention span at this point in her development.
