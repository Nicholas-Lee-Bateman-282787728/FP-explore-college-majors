1695857,A3J1L5HC0RMCDX,B00JA3RPAG,"Anonymous45 ""michael cifelli""","[3, 5]","There are so many reasons to watch this movie, and not one I can think of not to. It has so many serious, funny, sentimental, and intense themes running through it, that so many who watch this will identify with this movie. I wont give away anything really important but I will share some of the things I loved about it. Costner is a CIA agent, and decides for a few reasons he wants to retire and reconnect with his estranged wife and daughter. Now, he has three days to do this one last job, and promised his wife that he would be out of the CIA life for good. I will say there is something really serious that makes him really reflect on his life.Now, while trying to complete this last job, he has a boss who is a really beautiful, strong, tough young lady who promises him something that will benefit him and his family if he finishes this last job. Now as he is in the middle of this job, his wife goes away on business, and Costner's character says &#34;no sitter, I will take care of her.&#34; He was confident he could handle a teenage girl because he had one good moment with his daughter and helped her feel good about her hair. This is where the real humor comes in. I have a teenage daughter and she has a mood for every moment of the day. And what she loves today, she will hate tomorrow, and it's my fault I did not know this ahead of time. Hailee Steinfeld who plays his daughter was priceless in this role and plays the teenager role perfectly. I wont give anything away But there is a scene where he buys her a bike. In fact when he shows up to say hi after several years away, he brings this bike with him for his daughter. Remember I said you need to remember this bike and that I am telling you it is key for some of the funniest moments in this movie. Now, this is not a comedy. It is a very serious movie with good solid humor, a father ending his career in the CIA and while doing this last job, he has to watch over his daughter. I related to this movie because of the intense action, fight scenes, shoot outs, the mysterious beautiful woman who gives him this last job, and how Costner wants more then anything to reconnect with his daughter and his wife. The writing I think is amazing, the acting even better, and the balance of so many themes going on was brilliant. This is one of Costner's best work in years and I am telling you, this is a movie for almost everyone. It will make you smile, make you cry, make you think, and all the while you have this intense action / drama film going on. I really think the dynamic between Costner and his daughter really makes this movie along with so many other things you will love. It will be different for everyone, but one thing is for sure, if you want to see a great film, and to be entertained for over 90 minutes, then it is a must see for you. You just cant go wrong with this film. It just hits all the right marks, humor but maintains the serious nature of what he does for a living. Now remember, I left a lot out. I did not want to give away anything like a commercial would. It is an action film, a drama, humor in all the right places, a father reconnecting with his family, especially his daughter, and that is the part that actually made me laugh out loud. Picture a tough guy Killer CIA agent trying to think like a teenage girl and think it will be easy!!!! If you are parents, you will get this, if you are not, there is a ton of other scenes, plot, and theme that will make you love this film. I hope you give it a try.

There is probably more romance and family drama (childbirth, dancing with daughter, ""I'm sorry"" conversations with ex, ""I'm sorry"" conversations with daughter) than fighting action in this movie.The comedy elements are much more emphasized than in, say, Taken, which was all ""serious"" action.

In some ways it's odd that the romance is treated as gravely serious, while the action is treated as droll comedy.I was a bit annoyed at the number of critical action scenes that were suddenly averted by Ethan ""getting sick"": Literally seconds from shooting a bad guy, he will constantly collapse, then roll on the ground with blurred vision.

I do think that his acting and roles have evolved and he seems more comfortable and relaxed on the screen now than when he was younger.  The character he plays in this film is different than most action/adventure films. Picture a, shall we say, &#34;hit man&#34; for the Agency.  He has found out he is dying of cancer and quits his job to spend his last moments getting to know his estranged daughter and patch things up with her and his ex-wife.  Nothing is quite that easy and he is forced back into duty for one last mission-at the same time that his wife leaves him in charge of his teenage daughter so she can go on a business trip. So here is the problem. How does he perform his job AND spend time with his daughter?  What results is a series of often humorous events where he tries to balance these two things. He even gets advice from others on how to handle his daughter at the most odd moments. Don't get me wrong there is plenty of action to go with it.

1695882,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00JA3RPAG,Chris Kennison,"[5, 11]","Good old French action cinema from the mind of Luc Besson. After years of exposure to American action movies that used to be really good and have since gone special effects heavy and lost the heart, watching a Besson movie is weird to say the least. While it has been years since American action movies remembered how to make audiences care, the French are at least trying; although frequently missing the mark.In &#34;Three Days to Kill&#34; things start off with a bang as we are introduced to Ethan Renner, a hitman who believes he has a cold. As the action explodes and we witness great direction from McG who knows how to choreograph a great action sequence, Renner falls short of accomplishing his goal; blacking out and awakening in a hospital. There he is told that he is dieing. This is where the heart of this action movie is inserted because Renner left his wife and daughter 5-years prior because of his dangerous career. With his life known to be short, Renner immediately goes to France to make things right with his life, wife and daughter.There&#8217;s a lot going on in &#34;Three Days to Kill&#34;. Within the first thirty minutes we are exposed to what we think may be an action movie and then it becomes a drama and then the two collide to become a comedy. It&#8217;s a typical Luc Besson formula and I found this to be similar to 2013&#8217;s Deniro movie &#34;The Family&#34; in which Besson wrote and directed himself. It&#8217;s a difficult thing for a director and movie to bounce back and forth between such extreme moods and it worked much better in &#34;The Family&#34; than &#34;Three Days to Kill&#34;. Although, had it not been somebody like Kevin Costner in the lead role, this movies weird mood swings would have been even more disastrous. Costner, somehow, makes most of it work.There&#8217;s a point toward the end of &#34;Three Days to Kill&#34; where I was awoken from my boredom; not by a great action sequence, but a great moment between father and daughter. I was actually ready to give a positive markup to the movie, despite some slow moments and some uninteresting writing. Before I could make it to the credits though, the biggest flaw in most French movies reared its ugly head; an illogical, coincidental, silly, just to setup the finale prom date that I won&#8217;t elaborate upon. Apparently, in French action movies, you don&#8217;t have to explain everything.

Many films are terrific but are brought down by little things that may annoy general audiences and I feel this film was very smooth from start to finish. I loved the characters, plot and clever writing. It had some wonderful twists, amusing and comical scenes that give you an uplifting feeling leaving you smiling.I also will not give a film 4-5 stars if most of the film is good but the ending is a letdown. This film doesn't let me down at all. Kevin Costner gives a solid performance in this action packed cia film. *spoilers* Killing is 2nd nature to him but wants to retire and focus on family after receiving some bad news. I was not only thoroughly entertained but I love films where you feel like you are actually there and can throw yourself into it like a great book. This film is recommended and also definitely worth it if you pay for it to rent or buy. I'd actually watch it again! Ha ha ""vodka and his gun."" Not sure if anyone else picked up on it but if he just would have carried around a flask with some vodka and maybe a gun he would have had no problems at all. Just take a drink when he has dizziness.

And Costner still has it!It moved pretty fast, there was action, there was wry humor, there was Costner's character's personal emotional conflict & desire to make up for past misgivings( he knows he was a crummy hubby, as well as a crummy Dad. The regret is very strong and many years have passed since he left the two of them).Then you learn of the little problem, where Costner is told he has a terminal illness and  maybe, with luck, he has a  handful of months at best to do the things he wants.You know, like reconnecting with loved ones.So that news throws a wrench into his plans of having a different future- a possibly new future.Stoically, he decides he will make the best of what time he has left, anyway.The problem is, no sooner does he make this decision, when he finds himself being sucked back into the kind of work he just wants to give up.But the lure used to get him back in, proves too irresistible and for good reason.( But I won't give anything away.)It isn't long before you learn how his illness, his work and his personal life are all interconnected in a complex triangle.He wants to live- he doesn't want to work- he wants to  focus on reuniting with his wife and child, but to do any of this, he is put in a catch  22 position.And so, that catch 22 provides the impetus for why he goes back into his line of work.All the while, you know as the movie unfolds, that he is racing against time- his time line to do his job, his time line on how long he may have to live.And then, there is his own personal time line to try to recapture what he once had with his family- if they will let him back in their lives.Like I said above-he is given an irresistible reason to NOT say No to the job .The story then unfolds quickly, once it is made clear to the audience why Costner is out there hunting bad guys( sick as he is), while trying to juggle in some quality time with the wife and daughter.I found this movie showed Costner still has talent, though I am not used to see him in Macho Kick Butt roles.While he is now older than his FIELD OF DREAMS days- he is ruggedly handsome, as opposed to the good looking boyishness he used to possess years back.So yes, he can still be a charming leading man- like Liam Neeson- who I believe is older than Costner by a few years.While he played this role believably- I don't really feel it suits him to be an actor in the* shoot em up /beat em up* category.This is more Jason Stratham's type of  movie genre.( And I do like Stratham )That being said, I look forward to seeing other  future movies Costner may be in.As for Amber Heard- her acting is not that great, but  as we know, she makes for excellent eye candy.For being an integral character in the movie, it seemed surprising she did not have a lot of dialog or more scenes.If you are a Costner fan, you won't be disappointed, but you may feel he is out of his element in this kind of movie genre.",3,Shows Costner's still got it-but this is not the best genre for him,1405209600,"07 13,

1695897,A3JW06DZ1S5E2H,B00JA3RPAG,Daniel B.,"[0, 0]","This is an example of a Hollywood genre I find extremely puzzling: the violent thriller with laughs. The only thing missing in this artificial exercise in crowd pleasing is the laugh track. Why did I watch it? Because the trailer looked promising. And I really like Kevin Costner. He is a real team player and always acts the script to a T. He can be effectively serious and dramatic, or equally effective in comedy and romance. Although in terms of acting I am more drawn to Ralph Fiennes, or Anthony Sher, or Derek Jacobi, or John Gielgud (Oh, the ones trained by and for Shakespeare - how quaint!), Kevin Costner strikes me as an indigenously American actor,like Jack Nicholson and Bruce Dern, and that is a sincere compliment to all three actors! Well, the script of this film is a hodge-podge. We get the sentimentality of a father-adolescent daughter relationship; the artificiality of the estranged wife who still swoons for her absentee husband; the deadly, invinciblespecial agent, who doesn't look at all physically fit. But whoever this film asks him to - father, husband, killer - Costner pulls it off with both drama and humor (sometimes simultaneously!). I think part of his success as an actor is his fleetness and mercurial charm. He moves so swiftly in terms of characterization you just are convinced. I'm not saying his body moves fast. Actually the script makes him quite clumsy. I mean his expressions and gestures, the way he listens when someone else is talking, or the way he speaks suddenly from the heart - he can be an amazingly subtle actor and he is always completely persuasive. This film may have a poor script but it has Kevin Costner's charisma on display, and that is surprisingly is enough for me to say I enjoyed it.",3,Kevin Costner's charisma on display,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,1752,"['example', 'Hollywood', 'genre', 'find', 'extremely', 'puzzling', 'violent', 'thriller', 'laughs', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'artificial', 'exercise', 'crowd', 'pleasing', 'laugh', 'track', 'Why', 'did', 'watch', 'trailer', 'looked', 'promising', 'really', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'real', 'team', 'player', 'always', 'script', 'T.', 'can', 'be', 'effectively', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'equally', 'effective', 'comedy', 'romance', 'terms', 'acting', 'am', 'more', 'drawn', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Anthony', 'Sher', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Oh', 'ones', 'trained', 'Shakespeare', 'how', 'quaint', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'indigenously', 'American', 'actor', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'sincere', 'compliment', 'three', 'actors', 'Well', 'script', 'film', 'hodge-podge', 'get', 'sentimentality', 'father-adolescent', 'daughter', 'relationship', 'artificiality', 'estranged', 'wife', 'who', 'still', 'swoons', 'absentee', 'husband', 'deadly', 'invinciblespecial', 'agent', 'who', ""n't"", 'look', 'physically', 'fit', 'whoever', 'film', 'father', 'husband', 'killer', 'Costner', 'off', 'drama', 'humor', 'sometimes', 'simultaneously', 'think', 'part', 'success', 'actor', 'fleetness', 'mercurial', 'charm', 'so', 'swiftly', 'terms', 'characterization', 'just', 'are', 'convinced', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'body', 'fast', 'Actually', 'script', 'quite', 'clumsy', 'mean', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'way', 'when', 'someone', 'else', 'talking', 'way', 'suddenly', 'heart', 'can', 'be', 'amazingly', 'subtle', 'actor', 'always', 'completely', 'persuasive', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'poor', 'script', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'charisma', 'display', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'say', 'enjoyed']",3 Days to Kill
1695898,AE62TIY3899YL,B00JA3RPAG,"Daniel J. Silva ""Superman_242""","[0, 1]","Kevin Costner&#8217;s had a rough go.  He went from being an Oscar winning actor with Dances With Wolves to laughing stock of the industry with The Postman.  He&#8217;s tried to broaden his horizons by taking more complex characters, but it turns out he is really awful at any other character or accent than his own (if you don&#8217;t believe me, watch Thirteen Days to see him butcher his role with a New England accent).  However, like Clint Eastwood before him, he is making somewhat of a renaissance in his older age, headlining two wide release films being released in the first half of the year.  Last night, I was privileged to see one of these films, 3 Days to Kill.  In it, Costner proves that he still has the ability to be a leading man whilst expanding his repertoire to include &#8216;repentant old man.&#8217;WHAT WORKEDWhere this film really works is in its portrayal of Costner trying to redeem himself in the eyes of his daughter.  While Hailee Steinfield gives a somewhat flawed performance as his teenage daughter, Costner more than makes up for it with his moving execution of the lead role.  It&#8217;s not a coincidence that the script/story was written by Luc Besson, the fellow behind Taken, another film that deals with an estranged father/daughter relationship.  I did not expect this kind of emotional depth in a McG film.McG films (yes, that&#8217;s the director&#8217;s actual legal name) are known for some pretty great action set pieces, and this movie is no exception.  Costner&#8217;s swagger combined with some great fight/infiltration choreography make this pretty fun to watch.The cinematography was generic, yet pretty with Paris as the film&#8217;s backdrop.  The soundtrack was above average, but a little too manipulative in certain scenes (always remember that I&#8217;m a soundtrack snob).The film was VERY funny.  I&#8217;ll leave it at that.WHAT DIDN&#8217;T WORKThe big elephant in the room is actually a petite, beautiful bombshell by the name of Amber Heard.  The film starts out with her as a normal-looking CIA agent in Langley.  However, she goes Gaga throughout the film.  And I mean literally: she basically becomes the Lady Gaga of spies, dressing in strange and provocative outfits, changes her hair colors every scene, and having some sort of weird stripper fetish that is never explained.  She&#8217;s just weird and completely out of place in the movie.  I took my mother with me to the screening, and as we walked out we both said to each other, &#8220;What was up with her?&#8221;  I never thought I&#8217;d say this, but the worst part of this movie is Amber Heard.  Her character-or lack thereof-really damaged the film.  I wanted to walk out feeling great about father/daughter relationship, yet all I could think about was how &#8216;WTF&#8217; Heard&#8217;s character was.  I suspect that they edited out a lot her character development in order to get a shorter running time and to get the much sought after PG-13 rating.CONCLUSIONAlthough a very flawed film, the father/daughter relationship makes 3 Days to Kill worth seeing, although maybe not in the theater.  Costner&#8217;s performance is solid and I&#8217;m glad to see that he still has it in him.3.5/5 Stars",4,A great father/daughter relationship film,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,3232,"['Kevin', 'Costner', '8217', 'had', 'rough', 'go', 'went', 'being', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'actor', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'laughing', 'stock', 'industry', 'Postman', '8217', 'tried', 'broaden', 'horizons', 'taking', 'more', 'complex', 'characters', 'out', 'really', 'awful', 'other', 'character', 'accent', 'own', 'don', '8217', 'believe', 'watch', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'see', 'butcher', 'role', 'New', 'England', 'accent', 'However', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'making', 'somewhat', 'renaissance', 'older', 'age', 'headlining', 'two', 'wide', 'release', 'films', 'being', 'released', 'first', 'half', 'year', 'Last', 'night', 'was', 'privileged', 'see', 'one', 'films', '3', 'Days', 'Kill', 'Costner', 'still', 'ability', 'be', 'leading', 'man', 'whilst', 'expanding', 'repertoire', 'include', '8216', 'repentant', 'old', 'man.', '8217', 'WHAT', 'WORKEDWhere', 'film', 'really', 'portrayal', 'Costner', 'trying', 'redeem', 'eyes', 'daughter', 'Hailee', 'Steinfield', 'somewhat', 'flawed', 'performance', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Costner', 'more', 'up', 'moving', 'execution', 'lead', 'role', '8217', 'not', 'coincidence', 'script/story', 'was', 'written', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'fellow', 'Taken', 'film', 'deals', 'estranged', 'father/daughter', 'relationship', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'kind', 'emotional', 'depth', 'McG', 'film.McG', 'films', 'yes', '8217', 's', 'director', '8217', 'actual', 'legal', 'name', 'are', 'known', 'pretty', 'great', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'movie', 'exception', 'Costner', '8217', 'swagger', 'combined', 'great', 'fight/infiltration', 'choreography', 'make', 'pretty', 'fun', 'watch.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'generic', 'yet', 'pretty', 'Paris', 'film', '8217', 's', 'backdrop', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'above', 'average', 'little', 'too', 'manipulative', 'certain', 'scenes', 'always', 'remember', '8217', 'soundtrack', 'snob', '.The', 'film', 'was', 'VERY', 'funny', '8217', 'leave', 'that.WHAT', 'DIDN', '8217', 'T', 'WORKThe', 'big', 'elephant', 'room', 'actually', 'petite', 'beautiful', 'bombshell', 'name', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'film', 'out', 'normal-looking', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Langley', 'However', 'Gaga', 'film', 'mean', 'literally', 'basically', 'Lady', 'Gaga', 'spies', 'dressing', 'strange', 'provocative', 'outfits', 'hair', 'colors', 'scene', 'having', 'sort', 'weird', 'stripper', 'fetish', 'never', 'explained', '8217', 's', 'just', 'weird', 'completely', 'place', 'movie', 'took', 'mother', 'screening', 'walked', 'out', 'said', 'other', '8220', 'What', 'was', 'up', '8221', 'never', 'thought', '8217', 'd', 'say', 'worst', 'part', 'movie', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'character-or', 'lack', 'thereof-really', 'damaged', 'film', 'wanted', 'walk', 'out', 'feeling', 'great', 'father/daughter', 'relationship', 'yet', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'how', '8216', 'WTF', '8217', 'Heard', '8217', 's', 'character', 'was', 'suspect', 'edited', 'out', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'order', 'get', 'shorter', 'running', 'time', 'get', 'much', 'sought', 'PG-13', 'very', 'flawed', 'film', 'father/daughter', 'relationship', '3', 'Days', 'Kill', 'seeing', 'maybe', 'not', 'theater', 'Costner', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'solid', '8217', 'glad', 'see', 'still', 'him.3.5/5', 'Stars']",3 Days to Kill

It switches from over-the-top (and a little offbeat) action / violence to sly humor on a dime.  It's sort of a character study of an aging CIA operative suffering from inoperable cancer.  The basic plot is simple.  Do one last job for a chance of receiving an experimental drug that may save his life.  The protagonist's best days are clearly behind him, yet he's still no one to mess with.  And being an operative, his family life has suffered, especially the relationship with his daughter.  Knowing his days are numbered, he tries to reestablish that relationship.  Some of the best moments involve this attempt and helps to insert the right amount of humor at often unusual and critical times.I have always gravitated to this type of movie.  Serious at times, but offbeat with surprising humor at other times.  Joss Whedon (no he didn't direct this) is famous for this type of flavor.  Whedon's Firefly, Serenity and The Avengers come immediately to mind.Between 1 and 10, I give ""3 Days to Kill"" a solid 8 (or a 4-star rating).  Looking for something a bit different with some aptly applied humor to break the tension?  This film fit the bill for me.  I'll be happy to add this movie to my blu-ray collection.After viewing the blu-ray:  For picture and sound quality, Oblivion is my reference blu-ray.  That being said, here are my thoughts on 3 Days to Kill:Picture quality:  8 out of 10 -- very good to excellent, but had a couple of minor problems with some of the editing choices.Audio quality:  8 out of 10 -- A surprising bass monster (rattled everything in sight) and in general very good throughout, although a bit exaggerated in certain scenes.",4,The man Hollywood loves to hate.,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,1745,"['Went', 'see', 'theaters', 'must', 'say', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'over-the-top', 'little', 'offbeat', 'action', 'violence', 'sly', 'humor', 'dime', 'sort', 'character', 'study', 'aging', 'CIA', 'operative', 'suffering', 'inoperable', 'cancer', 'basic', 'plot', 'simple', 'Do', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'chance', 'receiving', 'experimental', 'drug', 'may', 'save', 'life', 'protagonist', 'best', 'days', 'are', 'clearly', 'yet', 'still', 'one', 'mess', 'being', 'operative', 'family', 'life', 'suffered', 'especially', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Knowing', 'days', 'are', 'numbered', 'reestablish', 'relationship', 'best', 'moments', 'involve', 'attempt', 'insert', 'right', 'amount', 'humor', 'often', 'unusual', 'critical', 'times.I', 'have', 'always', 'gravitated', 'type', 'movie', 'Serious', 'times', 'offbeat', 'surprising', 'humor', 'other', 'times', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'famous', 'type', 'flavor', 'Whedon', 'Firefly', 'Serenity', 'Avengers', 'come', 'immediately', 'mind.Between', '1', '10', 'give', '3', 'Days', 'Kill', 'solid', '8', '4-star', 'rating', 'Looking', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'aptly', 'applied', 'humor', 'break', 'tension', 'film', 'fit', 'bill', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'add', 'movie', 'blu-ray', 'collection.After', 'viewing', 'blu-ray', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'Oblivion', 'reference', 'blu-ray', 'being', 'said', 'here', 'are', 'thoughts', '3', 'Days', 'Kill', 'Picture', 'quality', '8', '10', 'very', 'good', 'excellent', 'had', 'couple', 'minor', 'problems', 'editing', 'choices.Audio', 'quality', '8', '10', 'surprising', 'bass', 'monster', 'rattled', 'everything', 'sight', 'general', 'very', 'good', 'bit', 'exaggerated', 'certain', 'scenes']",3 Days to Kill
1695920,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B00JA3RPAG,D. S. Thurlow,"[38, 48]","""3 Days to Kill"" is an intriguing if uneven spy thriller starring Kevin Costner.  Costner is Ethan Renner, an aging CIA agent who learns at the end of a botched operation that he has terminal brain cancer.  Renner returns to Paris for an awkward reunion with his estranged wife Christine (Connie Nielson) and daughter Zoey (Hailee Steinfeld).  However, the CIA isn't quite finished with Renner.  Vivi Delay (Amber Heard), the rather exotic agent who has picked up the botched operation, knows Renner is the only person who can identify an illicit WMD dealer known as the Wolf.  She offers him an experimental drug for his cancer, in return for just one or two more little jobs...The movie is an odd mixture of elements.  The core of the movie is a string of extremely well-staged action sequences. In between is the family drama of Renner's reconnection with a rebellious daughter, parts of which ring true; the sometimes laugh-out-loud humor of Renner's dealings with the string of suspects who will lead him back to the Wolf; and his evolving relationship with the African family that has squatted in his apartment. The location shooting in Paris is quite good.  There is a strong element of betrayal built into the story; it is unclear right to the end who Renner can trust or how things might, or might not, work out for him.

Sisti ""ftt meditator""","[0, 0]","I have enjoyed Costner's work for decades and have even supported his quirky pieces such as &#34;Message In A Bottle&#34;, &#34;Waterworld&#34; and &#34;The Postman&#34; each of which drew a lot of &#34;fire&#34; from critics and larger film audiences.In my opinion, in &#34;3 Days to Kill&#34; his acting maturity and emotive excellence have exceeded his past works by far.By my criteria for enjoying films; the value of the writing, acting, directing and production, this movie hits high on all fronts, but especially for the writing of Costner's role and his acting. Even though he is portraying the central character he manages to carry the subdued gravitas of his character's situation through all of his scenes while raising the stakes with a measured, hard edged, side that he surfaces when called upon that plays as a counterpoint for the major theme of his character having a short time to live. Costner is to be congratulated for his bringing a better portrayal to that multi-faceted role than I believe the writer provided or that the director was attempting to evince from his actors. It is a gem of a picture for the depth of the main character alone.The rest of the cast does well but they are much more &#34;surface&#34; than the story allowed. I was especially pleased by the portrayal of the teenage daughter (Hailee Steinfeld of &#34;True Grit&#34; fame). She did not get the chance to provide the depth that she did in &#34;True Grit&#34; but her abilities are evident and, if you measure capability by her production resume (she has five films in &#34;completed&#34;, &#34;post-production&#34; and &#34;filming&#34; categories at the time of this writing), then she will have a long and great career in movies.I did find the antagonist roles to be too surface for my liking and the actors in those roles did not have much to work with but this movie is all about Costner's abilities and I totally agree with that choice.Definitely worth the viewing whether you are a Costner Fan such as myself or you just want to see a well produced thriller/drama or drama/thriller (you choose).Enjoy!",5,Kevin Costner Grows Better Each Year,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,2106,"['have', 'enjoyed', 'Costner', 'work', 'decades', 'have', 'even', 'supported', 'quirky', 'pieces', 'such', '34', 'Message', 'A', 'Bottle', '34', '34', 'Waterworld', '34', '34', 'Postman', '34', 'drew', 'lot', '34', 'fire', '34', 'critics', 'larger', 'film', 'opinion', '34', '3', 'Days', 'Kill', '34', 'acting', 'maturity', 'emotive', 'excellence', 'have', 'exceeded', 'past', 'works', 'far.By', 'criteria', 'enjoying', 'films', 'value', 'writing', 'acting', 'directing', 'production', 'movie', 'high', 'fronts', 'especially', 'writing', 'Costner', 'role', 'acting', 'Even', 'portraying', 'central', 'character', 'carry', 'subdued', 'gravitas', 'character', 'situation', 'scenes', 'raising', 'stakes', 'measured', 'hard', 'edged', 'side', 'when', 'called', 'counterpoint', 'major', 'theme', 'character', 'having', 'short', 'time', 'live', 'Costner', 'be', 'congratulated', 'bringing', 'better', 'portrayal', 'multi-faceted', 'role', 'believe', 'writer', 'provided', 'director', 'was', 'attempting', 'evince', 'actors', 'gem', 'picture', 'depth', 'main', 'character', 'alone.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'well', 'are', 'much', 'more', '34', 'surface', '34', 'story', 'allowed', 'was', 'especially', 'pleased', 'portrayal', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', '34', 'True', 'Grit', '34', 'fame', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'chance', 'provide', 'depth', 'did', '34', 'True', 'Grit', '34', 'abilities', 'are', 'evident', 'measure', 'capability', 'production', 'resume', 'five', 'films', '34', 'completed', '34', '34', 'post-production', '34', '34', 'filming', '34', 'categories', 'time', 'writing', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'long', 'great', 'career', 'movies.I', 'did', 'find', 'antagonist', 'roles', 'be', 'too', 'surface', 'liking', 'actors', 'roles', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'work', 'movie', 'Costner', 'abilities', 'totally', 'agree', 'choice.Definitely', 'viewing', 'are', 'Costner', 'Fan', 'such', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'well', 'produced', 'thriller/drama', 'drama/thriller', 'choose', '.Enjoy']",3 Days to Kill

He is joined by Adi Hasak in transforming his story 3 DAYS TO KILL in to a film. It is a mixed bag - not bad, not particularly good, but watchable because of the actors involved. The director is television director McG. The problem seems to be an attempt to be a father daughter mother reconciliation, dealing with metastasized brain cancer in a hired killer dependent on periodic injections of a experimental chemotherapeutic drug given at the hands of a super spy woman, and the taking down of the world's meanest criminals - supposedly the last job before our hired killer reconciles with his family to die of his cancer. Sound fun? Leave it to Kevin Costner to make it work.Ethan Renner (Kevin Costner), a dangerous international spy, is determined to give up his high stakes life to finally build a closer relationship with his estranged wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) and daughter Zooey (Hailee Steinfeld), whom he's previously kept at arm's length to keep out of danger. But first, he must complete one last mission - even if it means juggling the two toughest assignments yet: hunting down the world's most ruthless terrorists - The Wolf (Richard Sammel) and The Albino (T&oacute;mas Lemarquis) and looking after his teenage daughter for the first time in ten years, while his wife is out of town. The instigator of the action is the strange head of ideas Vivi Delay (Amber Heard) who elects to run Ethan's life as he tries to survive cancer and the flighty response of his daughter with whom he eventually forms a solid relationship through cutesy father/daughter means.Not a bad movie, a bit too long, a bit to sappy at times, but entertaining nevertheless.

It starts off reasonably despite the absence of any sort of logic and by about the 30 minute mark descends into embarrassment and frankly bizarre cinematic territory, borrowing ideas from Besson's other flicks and blending them all together.Amber Heard is the unconvincing femme fatale who functions mainly to drive at break-neck speed through Paris and Connie Nielsen is really wasted in providing the &#34;Are you still working for them?&#34;/&#34;You said you'd quit!&#34; routine every 20 minutes. Costner phones-in the performance and struggles to make much of the risible script other than to have his health condition kick in every time he sees the bad guys who, by the way, are inept and unthreatening.It's hard to believe this is from the same writer that brought us La Femme Nikita and Leon/The Professional, and though the film has his trademark pretty-but-deadly girl, it's really a neutered &#34;funny&#34; version of Taken. Director McG proves that screwing up Terminator 3 was no mistake and he's truly committed in his attempt to win a Razzie Award at some point soon.

1695960,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00JA3RPAG,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[2, 6]","I've been a monstrous fan of Kevin Costner since his star year in 1987 where he had the one-two punch of THE UNTOUCHABLES and NO WAY OUT, which were two fantastically entertaining films and he became a bonafide movie star. As time went on, his star seemed to rise to meteoric heights with the mega-punches of BULL DURHAM, FIELD OF DREAMS, DANCES WITH WOLVES, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, A PERFECT WORLD and JFK... until the high-concept &#34;flop&#34; of WATERWORLD. Suddenly, he seemed to be box-office poison. With every new role, I kept hoping that he would reclaim his status, but it just kept fading because the roles he took just weren't enough to sustain any kind of momentum. Sure there's a TIN CUP here and an OPEN RANGE there, but for every one of those, there was a FOR LOVE OF THE GAME and 3000 MILES TO GRACELAND. But after his earnest and scene-stealing performance as Pa Kent in MAN OF STEEL, it seemed like the time was right to get Costner back in the game. This leads us, sadly, to the tremendously banal action/family drama 3 DAYS TO KILL.We begin with Ethan Renner (Costner, whose character name literally reads like someone looking at IMDB at the cast/characters of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL and decided to combine names), a CIA wetworker whose assignment is to stop the exchange of a dirty bomb and eliminate the couriers. However, everything goes wrong, and combining that with a rare brain cancer that has metastasized in his lungs, he doesn't have long to live. He decides to reconnect with his estranged wife (Connie Nielsen) and rebellious teen daughter Zooey (Hailee Steinfeld) both now living in Paris in the time he has left. But the mysterious Vivi (Amber Heard) offers Ethan a potential cure for his cancer in exchange for him eliminating the threat of The Wolf (Richard Sammel), because... that's apparently important. So he has his daughter with him for three days while his wife is out of town, and in the interim, he has to do his job and humor and action and reconciliation ensues before the climax.This film was directed by McG, the filmmaker behind the CHARLIE'S ANGELS films, as well as TERMINATOR: SALVATION and THIS MEANS WAR, and co-written by Luc Besson, who turned in all of the currency he got from creating great, genre-defining action thrillers like LA FEMME NIKITA and THE PROFESSIONAL to co-write a series of goofy-cool star vehicles for actors like Jet Li (KISS OF THE DRAGON, UNLEASHED), Jason Statham (the TRANSPORTER series) and Liam Neeson (the TAKEN series). He wants to give the same gift of middle-aged badassery he gave to Neeson to Costner, but the problem is that this film is so cliched, it literally feels like McG and Besson had a checklist of tropes that they felt they could click off in the film's 117-minute runtime. Blowing stuff up? Check. Cool kills? Check. Oddly cool fashion choices for the hero? Check. Father and daughter not being able to relate, but bonding over visiting childhood locales? Check. Father confessing he doesn't know how to be a father? Check. An exceedingly fast reconciliation between husband and wife? Check. Totally convoluted climax with lots of shooting? Check. A drug and/or a condition that will always handicap the hero at the worst possible time? Check, check, and CHECK.At least when McG started out, he seemed to show a sense of flair behind the camera, but that time is long past. He's little more than a hack now. He shows no flair or style or immediacy. The pursuit of The Wolf is perfunctory at best, ultimately feeling like this was a film that was too busy trying to be a semi-serious action film as well as a semi-serious family drama and fails at both. Both Costner and Steinfeld are fine, but there's nothing original about them. They're walking cliches. The only character I thought was at all interesting in this film was Heard's character, walking a fine line between sexy, dangerous, intelligent and morally ambiguous, and she does it quite well, but the film can't seem to find time for her because it needs to spend more time with the father-daughter story.There's nothing offensive about 3 DAYS TO KILL, which is probably the most offensive thing about it.

Reynolds,"[2, 4]","WRITER LUC BESSON brings his magic touch to &#8220;3 Days to Kill&#8221; about a CIA terrorist specialist who&#8217;s suddenly retired when he develops terminal cancer.We know Besson from the &#8220;Transporter&#8221; series that made Jason Statham a household name &#8211; No.&#8217;s 4, 5, and 6 announced &#8211; &#8220;Taken,&#8221; with Liam Neeson, and &#8220;La Femme Nikita,&#8221; the original movie and both TV series. This time, he shares script credit with Adi Hasak &#8211; but make no mistake. This story is Besson&#8217;s.He likes his men macho and his women ultra-strong. His stories are always over the top and carry a smart, tongue-in-cheek humor. &#8220;3 Days to Kill&#8221; has all these qualities &#8211; so I wonder why it wasn't the hit it should have been. (Critics hated it, too &#8211; but what do they know? Is there some weird anti-Costner thing going on?)Gonna tell you now, I love it. Kevin Costner is perfect as American cowboy assassin Ethan Renner. He&#8217;s on the trail of a dirty-bomb selling terrorist known as The Wolf (Richard Sammel) and his henchman, The Albino (T&oacute;mas Lemarquis). Ethan finds himself back on the case via his dominatrix-type handler, Vivi (Amber Heard), who tempts him with an experimental drug that could cure &#8211; at least delay &#8211; his pending demise. This is important because our hero hopes to re-bond with his ex-wife and daughter.What makes this work is the chemistry between Costner and the ladies who make up his family played by Connie Nielsen (&#8220;Gladiator&#8221;) and Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar-nominated for &#8220;True Grit.&#8221; Strong women, see? There&#8217;s also great chemistry between Costner and those who become his unwilling informants, bringing in some unexpected humor &#8211; more like the kind we found in &#8220;RED&#8221; (&#8220;Retired Extremely Dangerous.&#8221; Not Besson, still great).Visuals and sound are Blu-ray terrific. A busload of extras provides interviews with the cast, Besson and director McG, known for his TV prowess with &#8220;Nikita,&#8221; &#8220;Chuck&#8221; and &#8220;Supernatural.&#8221; We learn about the stunts and action sequences &#8211; all on a par with &#8220;Taken.&#8221; But the winner is the feature with ex-CIA agent, Bob Baer, who tells us about the problems of keeping a family together and working in the agency. He also hits on improbable cover stories, how not-to-make friends while on assignment, and the drive to pursue the bad guy. Life in the CIA &#8211; &#8220;It&#8217;s like out of the movies,&#8221; he says, laughing.He also says agents learn not to trust anyone &#8211; even their own people. But you can trust me. This is an excellent action flick with memorable characters and great stunts.

1696033,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00JA3RPAG,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","There may be spoilers.I think that those trying to compare this spy thriller with the ""Taken"" movies and Liam Neeson suddenly becoming a premier action star are missing the boat.  There are some similarities to be sure.  Ethan Renner, a CIA operator is played by Kevin Costner.  Like Neeson, Costner may be past his prime hunk status of a decade or more ago, but also like Neeson, he still has a certain presence that commands your attention.  This film also features a teenage daughter, here played by rising star Hailee Steinfeld.  She's not kidnapped or in immediate danger.  But she is taught how to ride a bicycle - a purple one at that - by absentee father Ethan.  Unlike the Neeson vehicles, this one is played for laughs, quiet though they may be.Ethan is forced to retire when he learns he has a lethal cancer that gives him just a few months to live.  Now living in Paris (much shot in Serbia), he's asked to perform one last assignment by his new handler, Vivi Delay (really) played by Amber Heard in mostly dominatrix designs.  The two strike a bargain.  Ethan gets cash, a large life insurance policy and most importantly, a magical drug that has the potential to stave off his illness.  In return he has to kill a couple bad guys known as The Wolf (Richard Sammel) and The Albino (Tomas Lemarquis) who have plans to set off a suitcase nuke.  One other problem.  The drug has some hallucinogenic side effects, which are amplified when the heart rate increases.So Ethan struggles with his multi-layered assassin assignment along with trying to put his family back together with Zooey (Steinfeld) and his estranged wife Christine (Connie Nielsen).  I almost forgot.  When Ethan tries to move back into his apartment, he finds an extended family of immigrants from an African country (Mali?) have moved in.  See, none of this is terribly serious.  Consider this.  In order to get the location of the primary bad guys, Ethan grabs the evil-doer's chauffer.  With some mild on-an-off torture, he solicits advice from the guy about how to deal with Zooey.  After all, the accountant has twin daughters Zooey's age.  And in another case, the torturee is an Italian accountant who is asked to provide the recipe for spaghetti sauce for Zooey.  Most of this is ridiculous of course but that's the fun of it all.  And Costner is a pretty good straight man.  Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of action sequences that are formidable if nothing new.  This isn't a great movie or even a very good movie.  But I had a good time.I watched this film on an excellent Blu ray transfer.  It comes in a 1080p resolution and a 2.37:1 aspect ratio.  Beautifully detailed - check out the gracefully aging Costner face - and provides some terrific panoramic shots of Paris.  Colors are excellent.  Great picture.  The audio is excellent as well.  The primary track is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  It works great, especially in the numerous action sequences including the requisite car chase, several gun battles and some close up fighting.

Luc Besson is primarily responsible for the script which, not surprisingly, therefore is shot mostly in Paris.  That's the plus. Otherwise, not so good.Costner, an aging, always disheveled CIA  ""agent on the ground,"" is assigned to capture a dirty bomb being sold from the ""Albino"" to the ""Wolf,"" two international bad guys who need to be taken out as well. After his first encounter with the Albino, a doctor tells him his cold symptoms are actually those of cancer and gives him 3 months to live.  Amber Heard, an unflappable super CIA agent, invariably dressed in garb that better suits a dominatrix, is sent to assist Costner. She offers him an experimental drug that will potentially extend his life - but only if he finishes the job. There is then a procession of action scenes set against farce, some with Heard, in which he is either rousting or shooting down a long line of inept thugs.Yet, what takes center stage is another theme entirely.  Amidst the violence, the film becomes a comedic chick flick as Costner stumblingly attempts to become Father Knows Best to his 17-year old daughter whom he's neglected for the last five years and is living in Paris with her mother. Adding more sap to the syrupy base is an out-of-context African immigrant family who have squatted in his Paris apartment during his lengthy absence.  Their simple manner apparently helps him realize what is really important in life (?).McG (give me a break!) directed this mess, while Besson thinks his lines are funny.

His retirement is short lived however, as his old bosses at the CIA promise to help with his medical care if he'll do one last job, a job he doesn't want his family to know about. 3 Days To Kill was made to look like the dying agent had 3 Days To Kill his target, but that's not true at all. The title refers to him spending 3 days with the daughter he hasn't seen in 10 years. Like everyone else, I was fooled by the films promotion and decided to see it, even though Kevin Costner stars. I forgot the fact that Costner hasn't made a decent film in about fifteen years, and assumed that 3 Days To Kill would lead him away from romantic films and be a return to what made him a star, but it wasn't. The action and intensity of a CIA thriller is a back story, to a film about a dying man reconnecting with his family. It wasn't as boring or depressing as a full on drama, following a similar storyline, but it wasn't far off. Much of the hunt for his target was used as comedy to break up the monotony of watching Renner teaching his daughter to dance and ride a bicycle. To be honest, the film really is just a whole mix of things, none of which work. The cast is dreadful, the story is all over the place, and the film is just ridiculous. 3 Days To Kill was a horrible experience, and not only did I hate this film, I feel like I was tricked into watching it, by some clever marketing people, who knew the film was garbage. You can decide for yourself, but if you could use an extra two hours to do something you've been putting off, I'd skip this movie and get it done.",2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,2081,"['3', 'Days', 'Kill', 'was', 'promoted', 'very', 'misleading', 'way', 'previews', 'description', 'even', 'cover', 'DVD', 'make', 'exciting', 'thriller', 'even', 'manipulated', 'name', 'film', 'make', 'seem', 'one', 'thing', 'when', 'really', 'meant', 'story', 'centers', 'Ethan', 'Renner', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'man', 'who', 'spent', 'entire', 'life', 'killing', 'people', 'CIA', 'Renner', 'found', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'live', 'spend', 'remaining', 'time', 'family', 'largely', 'abandoned', 'retirement', 'short', 'lived', 'however', 'old', 'bosses', 'CIA', 'promise', 'help', 'medical', 'care', ""'ll"", 'do', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'job', ""n't"", 'want', 'family', 'know', 'about', '3', 'Days', 'Kill', 'was', 'made', 'look', 'dying', 'agent', 'had', '3', 'Days', 'Kill', 'target', 'not', 'true', 'title', 'refers', 'spending', '3', 'days', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'seen', '10', 'years', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'fooled', 'films', 'promotion', 'decided', 'see', 'even', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'stars', 'forgot', 'fact', 'Costner', ""n't"", 'made', 'decent', 'film', 'fifteen', 'years', 'assumed', '3', 'Days', 'Kill', 'would', 'lead', 'away', 'romantic', 'films', 'be', 'return', 'what', 'made', 'star', 'was', ""n't"", 'action', 'intensity', 'CIA', 'thriller', 'back', 'story', 'film', 'dying', 'man', 'reconnecting', 'family', 'was', ""n't"", 'boring', 'depressing', 'full', 'drama', 'following', 'similar', 'storyline', 'was', ""n't"", 'far', 'off', 'Much', 'hunt', 'target', 'was', 'used', 'comedy', 'break', 'up', 'monotony', 'watching', 'Renner', 'teaching', 'daughter', 'dance', 'ride', 'bicycle', 'be', 'honest', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'whole', 'mix', 'things', 'none', 'work', 'cast', 'dreadful', 'story', 'place', 'film', 'just', 'ridiculous', '3', 'Days', 'Kill', 'was', 'horrible', 'experience', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'hate', 'film', 'feel', 'was', 'tricked', 'watching', 'clever', 'marketing', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'film', 'was', 'garbage', 'can', 'decide', 'could', 'use', 'extra', 'two', 'hours', 'do', 'something', ""'ve"", 'been', 'putting', 'off', ""'d"", 'skip', 'movie', 'get', 'done']",3 Days to Kill

I'll take him over Gerard Butler, Antonio Banderas, or Mel Gibson even.  Sure, the running cliche is to say Costner needs to stick with sports movies.  Yuck, yuck, yuck.  But the problem with this movie wasn't Kevin Costner.  Oh no.  The problem with the movie was inherent in the movie itself.  It was a poor retread of Taken which i think they are up to the 3rd movie in that series which yes according to my book of cliche is 3 movies too many.I don't see the point of these type of stories even existing on the big screen anyways.  So I went to the cinema to take it in figuring the over long run time may give me plenty of time to figure out that riddle.

Is it a dramatic comedy about a father getting know his daughter?  Does it succeed as either?  No.Let me state right from the start that the 3 stars in this review are for the action scenes that are realistic, exciting, and different.  And for the performances Costner and Amber Heard give.This movie starts as if it is going to be an interesting spy movie.  Costner and his young (and stunningly beautiful) handler are riveting.  He is practical, no nonsense, violent, and smart.  She is crazy, heartless, unpredictable, and highly motivated.  If the movie had proceeded with these two characters and built itself into a serious plot, this might easily have become a novel film that rivals the Bond movies with its realism.******BEWARE SLIGHT SPOILERS BELOW:It fails us as a spy thriller because of all the interruptions, which amount to slow and boring scenes with family.  A teen whining and complaining and lying to her father who was never there for her.Then it turns interrogations into funny scenes.  When the hell has interrogation with a car battery ever been funny?Then, to top it all off, this highly competent operative does stupid things.  He allows strangers to live in his home--yeah, the home where he keeps all of his equipment.  He takes hostages into his home filled with strangers.  Then he tortures them in the bathroom there while little kids are running around just outside in the hall.  While he interrogates, he gets fatherly advice from one criminal and a delicious Italian tomato sauce recipe from another guy.  He puts the first guy in a car trunk multiple times and parks in crowded areas--here is where the &#34;comedy&#34; of it all is supposed to distract us.  No one notices the banging in the trunk.  No.  Not at a school teeming with teens.******SPOILERS OVER.When &#34;Ethan&#34; is called to action by his new handler, things get really good.  When the film tries to portray him as a depressed dad or a funny torturer--I kid you not--it fails miserably.  And it leaves US miserable.  And bored.
