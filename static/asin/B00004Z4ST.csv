I was surprised but glad that the film is presented in a widescreen format.  The film had a great cast which gave good performances.  The film's humorous moments were also enjoyable.  This movie can be compared to the film &quot;The American President&quot; and the series &quot;The West Wing&quot;.  This is one of the best films ever made.

I must admit I only bought it because it starred Tom Selleck. In fact, I only watched it to the end because I expected that since Tom Selleck and a number of other fine actors had agreed to be in the film that the plot must be about to turn a corner at any minute, what I mean is that it might find a plot line just around the corner. But then it ended, and I am left wondering, what was that about????

I couldn't get into it and had a hard time finding any humor in it at all. I got half way through it and had to turn it off.  Maybe I was expecting a satire on politics, instead what was revealed was the truth in politics and that isn't funny.  If the movie had fallen under a drama, I may have been able to get through it, but then again I probably wouldn't have bought it at all.
