There's no sense blaming the actresses.  Most of them are excellent and try hard; indeed, Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Bette Midler, Carrie Fisher and several others do their level best to bring some life to this horrible script: to no avail, it's quite hopeless.  Annette Bening is reliably vital and always welcome.  Debra Messing, just the opposite.  Meg Ryan, who looks disturbingly re-engineered, is somewhere in the middle.  Ms. Smith and Ms. Mendes are certainly adequate to their tasks, but there's just no saving this debacle.  I watched it with a growing sense of disappointment accompanied by moments of genuine horror.  Poor Meg Ryan has to say, when describing how she had reliably satisfied her husband in bed, ""I can suck the nails out of a board and that's a fact.""  (Try imagining Norma Shearer delivering THAT line.  No, perhaps you'd better not.)  This movie is worth watching only as a bad example of remakes - a film this awful does exert a kind of fascination: can it really be so bad?

The constant talking going on between the women playing the lead characters doesn't MEAN anything.

That's basically what happens throughout The Women.  The only difference is that, instead of a mall, it's all over a city.Who in the world thought this was a good idea for a storyline?

1156573,A2XFA2HIIKS5G2,B0017ANAZO,Bentley,"[4, 6]","The Women is a chick flick; there is no use denying it.  But I am surprised that so many did not enjoy it; I unabashedly did.  I thought that Meg Ryan did a credible job in this movie and I enjoyed the cast tremendously.  Love Annette Bening, Cloris Leachman and Candice Bergen.  Ms. Bergen almost ran away with the film; she was so good.  Meg's daughter in the movie (India Ennenga) did an outstanding job as the little girl who is almost forgotten and ignored when Mom becomes absorbed with her own emotions and loss of self esteem.A little bit of Eckart Tolle finds its way into the movie in the form of some of the spirituality messages which abound in his book The Power of Now.  Meg Ryan asks herself finally, ""What Do You Want?""  Easy enough question to ask; but very hard to answer when you have forgotten what you wanted in the first place out of life and submerged your own goals and aspirations in lieu of what your family or successful spouse wanted to achieve.At a deeper level, I think the movie discusses admirably how women can take a detour and lose their self esteem while bolstering their family, children and others.  Many times they do not take the time to take some selfish interest in their own needs, desires and goals and they sadly lose their way in life.  Another subliminal message deals with marriage and the importance of keeping the relationship alive by focusing on being happy with yourself and what you bring to the relationship.  Friendship and betrayal of trust are also front and center; and when a person becomes fearful or pushed to the wall; how loyal and trustworthy would they be?  Would you sell out your friendship or your ideals to hold a job or to advance yourself or to save your own neck?At a psychological and spiritual level, I think the movie really works.  It examines those motivations and life events that many women just take for granted and/or ignore.  Many times women think that what happens in break-ups or marital conflict only happens to other people next door or other family members; until it hits home.  This is very much a story of how a woman picks up the pieces and gets to know herself and exactly what she wants out of life and from herself.I liked the movie; I love Meg Ryan and Candy Bergen; it was a very entertaining film and it may hit close to home; more than you might expect.  And there is always Bette Midler thrown in for good measure.And the trick question: There was only one male in the entire movie; who was it?  You may overlook it if you are not careful!  And if you only get one thing from the movie; if you actually start thinking about what you really want; the time spent will not be wasted; but very well worth it and even enjoyable!  There are many good laughs in this film; and everyone can learn to even hate Crystal Allen (the beautiful Eva Mendes who is the ole spritzer gal).Bentley/2009",4,"The Women and ""One Male""",1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,2883,"['Women', 'chick', 'flick', 'use', 'denying', 'am', 'surprised', 'so', 'many', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'unabashedly', 'did', 'thought', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'did', 'credible', 'job', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'cast', 'tremendously', 'Love', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'Ms.', 'Bergen', 'almost', 'ran', 'away', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'Meg', 'daughter', 'movie', 'India', 'Ennenga', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'ignored', 'when', 'Mom', 'absorbed', 'own', 'emotions', 'loss', 'self', 'esteem.A', 'little', 'bit', 'Eckart', 'Tolle', 'way', 'movie', 'form', 'spirituality', 'messages', 'abound', 'book', 'Power', 'Now', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'finally', 'What', 'Do', 'Want', 'Easy', 'enough', 'question', 'ask', 'very', 'hard', 'answer', 'when', 'have', 'forgotten', 'what', 'wanted', 'first', 'place', 'life', 'submerged', 'own', 'goals', 'aspirations', 'lieu', 'what', 'family', 'successful', 'spouse', 'wanted', 'achieve.At', 'deeper', 'level', 'think', 'movie', 'admirably', 'how', 'women', 'can', 'take', 'detour', 'lose', 'self', 'esteem', 'bolstering', 'family', 'children', 'others', 'Many', 'times', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'time', 'take', 'selfish', 'interest', 'own', 'needs', 'desires', 'goals', 'sadly', 'lose', 'way', 'life', 'subliminal', 'message', 'deals', 'marriage', 'importance', 'keeping', 'relationship', 'alive', 'focusing', 'being', 'happy', 'what', 'bring', 'relationship', 'Friendship', 'betrayal', 'trust', 'are', 'also', 'front', 'center', 'when', 'person', 'fearful', 'pushed', 'wall', 'how', 'loyal', 'trustworthy', 'would', 'be', 'Would', 'sell', 'out', 'friendship', 'ideals', 'hold', 'job', 'advance', 'save', 'own', 'neck', 'psychological', 'spiritual', 'level', 'think', 'movie', 'really', 'motivations', 'life', 'events', 'many', 'women', 'just', 'take', 'granted', 'and/or', 'ignore', 'Many', 'times', 'women', 'think', 'what', 'break-ups', 'marital', 'conflict', 'only', 'other', 'people', 'door', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'home', 'very', 'much', 'story', 'how', 'woman', 'up', 'pieces', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'life', 'herself.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'love', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Candy', 'Bergen', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'may', 'hit', 'close', 'home', 'more', 'might', 'expect', 'always', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.And', 'trick', 'question', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'male', 'entire', 'movie', 'who', 'was', 'may', 'overlook', 'are', 'not', 'careful', 'only', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'actually', 'start', 'thinking', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'time', 'spent', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'wasted', 'very', 'well', 'even', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'laughs', 'film', 'everyone', 'can', 'learn', 'even', 'hate', 'Crystal', 'Allen', 'beautiful', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'who', 'ole', 'spritzer', 'gal', '.Bentley/2009']","Women, The (2008) (DVD)"

But the question posed by Diane English in her 2008 update on THE WOMEN is: do they really want it all?If anyone was going to create a modern-day spin on Clare Boothe Luce's catty 1930's Broadway play, THE WOMEN (made famous in the 1939 MGM movie starring Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford), it was ""Murphy Brown"" scribe Diane English.  While time has rolled on, the problems concerning women certainly haven't.When down-to-earth Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) discovers that her husband has taken on a seductive perfume counter clerk named Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes) as his mistress, she paints her nails jungle-red and reinvents herself as a boutique fashion designer - but not without some support from her faithful gal-pals including magazine editor Sylvie (Annette Bening), ""serial mother"" Edie (Debra Messing) and outspoken lesbian author Alex (Jada Pinkett Smith).As in the original, no man ever appears on screen, and Ms English has wisely retained many of the best lines from the source material (there's also a clever black-and-white twist on the original's Technicolor fashion show sequence!) .  While a lot of what English newly creates for the remake might seem fresh and cutting edge - ie: Mary's eleven-year-old daughter (India Ennenga) who starts smoking to suppress her appetite - I think she's tried too hard to cram in as many modern elements as possible, making the film seem overstuffed with information.  The crux of the story remains Mary's reinvention, and Meg Ryan portrays that nicely.  And I appreciate the fact that, unlike the original in which we see Norma Shearer (as Mary) tearfully running back into her husband's arms; the question of whether Mary will in fact return to her marriage is left up to the audience.Fantastic performances all-round, particularly from Messing, Bening and Pinkett Smith as the main trio; Cloris Leachman is the Haines housekeeper and has some great scenes, and no Diane English film would be complete without ""Murphy Brown"" herself, Candice Bergen, who plays Mary's mother.

1156578,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0017ANAZO,Chris Pandolfi,"[30, 39]","""The Women"" is the film ""Sex and the City"" wishes it was. There are some distinct similarities: both are about a group of female friends living in New York; both feature quirky main characters; both tackle relationship and fidelity issues; both look at life through a very witty filter (mostly to a fault). But ""The Women"" is the superior film, and that's only partly because of its much more tolerable sense of humor; the characters in this film are examined maturely, allowing us to see them as more than shallow, artificial caricatures. I actually felt something for these women. I cared about them and wondered what would happen to them. While not faithful to either George Cukor's 1939 film or the original play by Clare Boothe Luce, this new film is a delight from beginning to end, and it plays true to its title by not featuring a single male character.The plot mainly focuses on fashion designer Mary Haines (Meg Ryan), who, in addition to being fired by her own father, discovers that her well-known husband, Stephen, is having an affair with Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes), a perfume saleswoman from Saks Fifth Avenue. Standing by Mary is her best friend, magazine editor Sylvia Fowler (Annette Benning), who had already heard about the affair through a gossipy manicurist (Debi Mazar). Sylvia, as it turns out, is having problems of her own; her magazine isn't selling as well as it used to, meaning she's inches away from being fired. Desperate to keep her career alive, she sells Mary's high-profile story to a tabloid writer (a cameo by Carrie Fisher), which, as you might expect, threatens to destroy their friendship. She's no longer sure she can trust anyone, and this includes her other two friends, writer Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett Smith), and the ever-pregnant Edie Cohen (Debra Messing).Would this story be better or worse if male characters were included? Chances are it would be worse, simply because male/female relationship stories are a dime a dozen. What makes ""The Women"" unique is that it forces the main character to analyze her situation from an entirely feminine perspective. A man--be it her husband, a friend, a brother, or even a stranger--is not there to influence her one way or another. Think about all the recent romantic comedies in which the male leads inevitably profess their undying love for the female co-stars: every scene like that is always so contrived, so out of touch with anything realistic or even plausible. No such scene exists in ""The Women."" Through the support of her friends, the wisdom of her mother (Candice Bergen), the loyalty of her housekeeper (Cloris Leachman), and an awful lot of soul searching, Mary has to determine on her own whether or not she wants to take her husband back. The question is: Does he want to be taken back? Is he still in love with her, or has he moved on?An interesting subplot focuses on the relationship between Mary and her eleven-year-old daughter, Molly (India Ennenga), who often feels unheard and misunderstood. She doesn't appreciate her mother's meaningless assertions that everything will be all right. Clearly, it won't be. She misses the love her parents shared, a love that always put an extra bounce in her mother's step. And like many young girls growing up in Western society, she believes she fat (even though she's anything but). Mary, consumed with her own problems, fails to notice the warning signs her daughter is giving off. So imagine her surprise when she learns that Molly is turning to Sylvia for advice--Sylvia, a childless woman who threw her best friend to the wolves. The confrontation between her and Mary is an interesting scene, not only because it's heartfelt and humorous at the same time, but also because of the way it's constructed; they defend themselves at the start, but by the end, one knows exactly where the other is coming from. If only all disagreements could end that way.On a women's retreat, Mary meets an agent named Leah Miller (another cameo by Better Midler). As they share a joint in their cabin, Leah reveals her secret to living life: Be selfish. Don't care about what others want. The sooner you ask, ""What do I want?"" the sooner you'll be content. I can't say whether or not Mary takes this idea to heart, given how she really feels about her husband. What I can say is that the women of ""Sex and the City"" followed it to a tee. Rarely have I seen characters so shallow, so annoying, so lacking in redeeming qualities.Thank goodness ""The Women"" goes in a much different direction. The pleasure of watching this movie comes from knowing that writer/director Diane English added depth to the characters. Granted, some were given more attention than others; Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing weren't given much screen time, which is disappointing considering the narrative potential of their characters. This is especially true of Messing's character, the eccentric Edie, who announces early on that she'll keep getting pregnant until she has a boy (she already has three daughters). Wouldn't it be fun if she were the best friend instead of Sylvia? Or what about Smith's character, Alex, made openly gay for this modernized version? Both characters come dangerously close to being extraneous. Maybe it would have been better if the story focused on two friends instead of four. Be that as it may, ""The Women"" is a charming, well-acted, well-plotted film--about the most fun you'll have in a male-free environment.",4,No Man's Land,1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,5460,"['Women',

Her friends find out about it before she does (from a mancurist of all people) and they debate whether or not to tell her.  Mary (the one with the no-good, frog-faced, rougish, rat fink dog of a husband) finds out herself from the same mancurist and her Mom's advices her on what to do.  Mom suggests that she does nothing b/c if the husband really loved the girl, Mary would have felt it long ago and if she gets her friends involved then she'll just have another thing that she'll have to deal with.Mary finally confronts the other woman (Crystal) that's creeping around with her husband in a dressing room.  After Crystal obviously has no remorse about what she's doing, Mary confronts Steven (the rat) and says she wants a divorce.She gets the divorce in Reno but realizes too late that neither of them really want the divorce.  Steven feels that it is his duty to marry Crystal to protect what was left of her reputation.  (Yeah, I know, but men were a bit more chivalrous back then, which is pretty cool b/c nowadays some men leave ya with nothing more than a a kick in the teeth).Over a year passes and Mary still loves Steven and by now Steven can't stand Crystal.  Mary finds out that Crystal is cheating on Steven and devises a way to expose Crystal and get Steven back.  She does, the end.Fast forward to 2008 and what happens?!  A total disappointment!!  Okay, that wasn't completely accurate.  On its own I give it 1 1/4 out of 5 stars b/c the movie provide a few chuckles but as a modern day adaptation 1 1/2 and that's only because they did stay true to the plot for the most part.  I also give it props b/c it dealt with issues that women face today like the influence of the media on women's body images.  Good show for that.  But, even though it kept your attention (for me, it was mostly out of pure curiosity), it wasn't the laugh fest that I thought it would be.

1156588,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0017ANAZO,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","Director/screenwriter Diane English's 2008 update of George Cukor's1939 MGM classic comedyunfortunately shows more mothballs than its predecessor. Based on Clare Booth Luce's shrewdly observant 1936 play on the relationships that evolve among a strictly female group of pampered Manhattan socialites, the story would seem ripe for a contemporary remake. Instead, because of English's thematic overreach, the production comes across as an extended therapy session with a paucity of wit. What's more, the diverse lifestyles of women today have been reduced to sitcom-level stereotypes in this movie, and the original play's central conceit of eliminating men from the storyline seems even more contrived given the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred among men as well as women since the 1930's. To add insult to injury, the recent big screen adaptation of HBO'sSex and the Citydid this sort of sorority-style dishing much better and with far sharper fangs.The skeleton of the original play remains as the story centers on wealthy Mary Haines, who gave up her promising clothing design career to become the devoted wife of a Wall Street financial wizard. Like ""Sex and the City"", she is surrounded by three best friends - Sylvie Fowler, a successful, cutthroat magazine editor in the mold of Miranda Priestly inThe Devil Wears Prada(yet another film this echoes); perennially pregnant Edie Cohen representing the stay-at-home wife; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian author who seems to represent every repressed group generally excluded from such an exclusive clique. Through a mouthy manicurist, they find out Mary's husband is having an affair with man-eater Crystal Allen, a perfume girl at Saks more than willing to break up a marriage as she struggles to become an actress. The rest of the plot doesn't matter much since it becomes a series of scenes focused on sisterly bonding and bickering, none of it very illuminating and without the satirical zing that buoyed the 1939 movie.Looking strangely youthful at 47, Meg Ryan seems to play Mary in a manner that tries to resuscitate the goodwill she engendered in the 1990's withWhen Harry Met Sally...andSleepless in Seattle. It's not that she isn't age-appropriate here, but her familiar sprightliness seems at odds with the character's passive nature. Annette Bening fares somewhat better in the scene-stealing Rosalind Russell role of Sylvie because she has proven to be adept at conveying hardness while masking vulnerability, but her character goes through such a trite transformation that it undermines the actress' performance severely. Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a shallow, transparent shopgirl versus the smart, hard-edged cookie Joan Crawford got to play. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are scooted way to the sidelines as Edie and Alex, respectively. Much better are Candice Bergen as Mary's savvy, supportive mother and Cloris Leachman as the non-nonsense housekeeper.Probably reflecting the lackluster box office response to the film's release, the 2008 DVD doesn't have a robust set of extras. There are two deleted scenes - one with Crystal and her friends having a girls' night-in as a contrast to Mary's elaborate garden party, and the other an extension of Bette Midler's cameo as a multi-married Hollywood agent counseling Mary during a late night at a yoga camp. Two featurettes round out the extras - ""The Women: The Legacy"" about the history behind the film from the original 1936 play, and ""The Women Behind the Women"" which has cast and crew speak endlessly about female self-empowerment and self-image. The irony is that this version of ""The Women"" directed and scripted by a woman takes such a patronizing look at women.",2,"The women, not ""The Women""",1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,3717,"['Director/screenwriter', 'Diane', 'English', '2008', 'update', 'George', ""Cukor's1939"", 'MGM', 'classic', 'comedyunfortunately', 'more', 'mothballs', 'predecessor', 'Based', 'Clare', 'Booth', 'Luce', 'shrewdly', 'observant', '1936', 'play', 'relationships', 'evolve', 'strictly', 'female', 'group', 'pampered', 'Manhattan', 'socialites', 'story', 'would', 'seem', 'ripe', 'contemporary', 'remake', 'Instead', 'English', 'thematic', 'overreach', 'production', 'across', 'extended', 'therapy', 'session', 'paucity', 'wit', 'What', 'more', 'diverse', 'lifestyles', 'women', 'today', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'sitcom-level', 'stereotypes', 'movie', 'original', 'play', 'central', 'conceit', 'eliminating', 'men', 'storyline', 'even', 'more', 'contrived', 'given', 'openly', 'pansexual', 'evolution', 'occurred', 'men', 'as', 'well', 'women', '1930', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'recent', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', ""HBO'sSex"", 'Citydid', 'sort', 'sorority-style', 'dishing', 'much', 'better', 'far', 'sharper', 'fangs.The', 'skeleton', 'original', 'play', 'story', 'centers', 'wealthy', 'Mary', 'Haines', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'promising', 'clothing', 'design', 'career', 'become', 'devoted', 'wife', 'Wall', 'Street', 'financial', 'wizard', 'Sex', 'City', 'surrounded', 'three', 'best', 'friends', 'Sylvie', 'Fowler', 'successful', 'cutthroat', 'magazine', 'editor', 'mold', 'Miranda', 'Priestly', 'inThe', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'yet', 'film', 'perennially', 'pregnant', 'Edie', 'Cohen', 'representing', 'stay-at-home', 'wife', 'Alex', 'Fisher', 'lesbian', 'author', 'who', 'represent', 'repressed', 'group', 'generally', 'excluded', 'such', 'exclusive', 'clique', 'mouthy', 'manicurist', 'find', 'out', 'Mary', 'husband', 'having', 'affair', 'man-eater', 'Crystal', 'Allen', 'perfume', 'girl', 'Saks', 'more', 'willing', 'break', 'up', 'marriage', 'become', 'actress', 'rest', 'plot', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'series', 'scenes', 'focused', 'sisterly', 'bonding', 'bickering', 'none', 'very', 'illuminating', 'satirical', 'zing', 'buoyed', '1939', 'movie.Looking', 'strangely', 'youthful', '47', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'play', 'Mary', 'manner', 'resuscitate', 'goodwill', 'engendered', '1990', 'withWhen', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'andSleepless', 'Seattle', 'not', ""n't"", 'age-appropriate', 'here', 'familiar', 'sprightliness', 'odds', 'character', 'passive', 'nature', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'somewhat', 'better', 'scene-stealing', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'role', 'Sylvie', 'proven', 'be', 'adept', 'conveying', 'hardness', 'masking', 'vulnerability', 'character', 'trite', 'transformation', 'actress', 'performance', 'severely', 'Poor', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'play', 'Crystal', 'shallow', 'transparent', 'shopgirl', 'smart', 'hard-edged', 'cookie', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'got', 'play', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'are', 'scooted', 'way', 'sidelines', 'Edie', 'Alex', 'respectively', 'Much', 'better', 'are', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'Mary', 'savvy', 'supportive', 'mother', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'non-nonsense', 'housekeeper.Probably', 'reflecting', 'lackluster', 'box', 'office', 'response', 'film', 'release', '2008', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'robust', 'set', 'extras', 'are', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'one', 'Crystal', 'friends', 'having', 'girls', 'night-in', 'contrast', 'Mary', 'elaborate', 'garden', 'party', 'other', 'extension', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'cameo', 'multi-married', 'Hollywood', 'agent', 'counseling', 'Mary', 'late', 'night', 'yoga', 'camp', 'Two', 'featurettes', 'round', 'out', 'extras', 'Women', 'Legacy', 'history', 'film', 'original', '1936', 'play', 'Women', 'Women', 'cast', 'crew', 'speak', 'endlessly', 'female', 'self-empowerment', 'self-image', 'irony', 'version', 'Women', 'directed', 'scripted', 'woman', 'patronizing', 'look', 'women']","Women, The (2008) (DVD)"
1156589,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B0017ANAZO,Elisabeth,"[8, 11]","**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**Mary Haine (Meg Ryan) finds out her husband is cheating on her and her thoughtful, caring friends gather around to show their support.At least....that's what the description says.  But what's actually shown onscreen is a different story.Instead of support, what Mary gets is one long guilt trip.  First in line is her mother, who guilt trips her by saying if she divorces her cheating husband, she'll hurt their daughter.  For effect, we have a sad-faced daughter moping around and blaming her mother for everything.Mary's mom, however, conveniently forgets that by cheating, it was actually Mary's husband who broke up the family.  He knew full well his actions could hurt his family and could lead to divorce, but he didn't care enough about his family to stop himself....so then, why is Mary the one getting lectured?The person, though,  who really lays it on thick is Mary's friend (played by Debra Messing).  Her friend confesses that she cheated on her husband and then angrily yells at Mary that her husband forgave her anyway because he's a good man who loves her....meaning, if Mary gets a divorce, she's obviously a bad person who doesn't truly love her husband.So much for moral support!As if  these guilt trips weren't bad enough, we  also  have another so-called friend (played by Annette Benning) who throws Mary under the bus to save her career.  This woman even steals another woman's ideas to save her career, too.  She does later quit her job and I'm supposed to believe it's because she grew a conscience...but I think she quit because if she didn't, she'd soon be fired anyway for not being considered hip enough to stay in the magazine industry.Earlier, when this same friend (and another friend)  find  out Mary's husband  is  cheating,  they both withhold the truth from Mary.  They  justify  their decision saying they were  just  protecting her.  But withholding the truth doesn't protect Mary.  It protects her husband.  Thanks to their silence, Mary's husband gets to continue having his cake and eat it, too.And also because of their silence, Mary has to find out about the adultery from a complete stranger.  How embarrassing is that?None of the women in this movie had Mary's best interests at heart.  Not even the housekeeper who wants to preserve Mary's marriage  --  not because it's in Mary's best interest to do so  --  but because if the couple divorces, she'll be out of a job.Normally, I'd feel sorry for someone in Mary's shoes, except I can't because Mary is so spineless.  Not only does she share the blame for her husband's adultery, but she also treats him like a helpless victim, too....as if he had no other choice but to cheat on her.First, Mary blames his  mistress,  believing this mistress came on so strong, the poor guy didn't stand a chance.  Right...like his mistress was some bully who forced him to have sex with her.She then makes a fool of herself by demanding that the mistress let her husband go...again, as if she's some bully holding him hostage.But she's not.  Mary's husband entered the affair out of his own free will.  It was his choice to do this.Mary can't accept this even at the end when she tells him she caused him to cheat because she wasn't a whole woman back then.  Now that she's a whole person, they can be together now.But Mary's husband didn't cheat because of what Mary lacked.  He cheated because of what he lacked...the ability to face problems head on.He's so poor at facing problems that he even stays in an affair he wants to leave because he doesn't want to deal with his mistress's anger.These messages disturbed me because too often, it's the victim who's unfairly blamed for their partner's adultery and this movie backs up the adulterer.  There's a very casual  tone here concerning adultery.  Although there's  one scene where Mary cries over being cheated on, for the most part, she doesn't seem too affected by it.  Shortly after she discovers his adultery, she's even laughing and having a good time with her mom.The message this sends to female viewers is that they, too, should just shrug adultery off as a minor offense and just forgive as quickly as Mary does.The acting in this movie  is  pretty bad, too.  Annette Benning overacts as usual.  Debra Messing, who's usually funny,  also overacts.  But  it was Jada Pinkett-Smith who is the most miscast here.  She seemed really self-conscious in this role and it was cringe-inducing to watch her.  Meg  Ryan's acting  came off okay only because everyone else performed so poorly.Overall, this movie went from bad to worse.",1,Where was the so-called moral support?,1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,4596,"['**REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS**Mary', 'Haine', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'out', 'husband', 'cheating', 'thoughtful', 'caring', 'friends', 'gather', 'show', 'support.At', 'least', 'what', 'description', 'what', 'actually', 'shown', 'onscreen', 'different', 'story.Instead', 'support', 'what', 'Mary', 'one', 'long', 'guilt', 'trip', 'First', 'line', 'mother', 'who', 'guilt', 'trips', 'saying', 'cheating', 'husband', ""'ll"", 'hurt', 'daughter', 'effect', 'have', 'sad-faced', 'daughter', 'moping', 'around', 'blaming', 'mother', 'everything.Mary', 'mom', 'however', 'conveniently', 'cheating', 'was', 'actually', 'Mary', 'husband', 'who', 'broke', 'up', 'family', 'knew', 'full', 'well', 'actions', 'could', 'hurt', 'family', 'could', 'lead', 'divorce', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'family', 'stop', '.so', 'then', 'why', 'Mary', 'one', 'getting', 'lectured', 'person', 'though', 'who', 'really', 'thick', 'Mary', 'friend', 'played', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'friend', 'cheated', 'husband', 'then', 'angrily', 'yells', 'Mary', 'husband', 'forgave', 'anyway', 'good', 'man', 'who', '.meaning', 'Mary', 'divorce', 'obviously', 'bad', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'truly', 'love', 'husband.So', 'much', 'moral', 'support', 'guilt', 'trips', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'also', 'have', 'so-called', 'friend', 'played', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'who', 'Mary', 'bus', 'save', 'career', 'woman', 'even', 'woman', 'ideas', 'save', 'career', 'too', 'later', 'quit', 'job', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'grew', 'conscience', 'think', 'quit', 'did', ""n't"", ""'d"", 'soon', 'be', 'fired', 'anyway', 'not', 'being', 'considered', 'hip', 'enough', 'stay', 'magazine', 'industry.Earlier', 'when', 'same', 'friend', 'friend', 'find', 'out', 'Mary', 'husband', 'cheating', 'withhold', 'truth', 'Mary', 'justify', 'decision', 'saying', 'were', 'just', 'protecting', 'withholding', 'truth', ""n't"", 'protect', 'Mary', 'husband', 'Thanks', 'silence', 'Mary', 'husband', 'continue', 'having', 'cake', 'eat', 'too.And', 'also', 'silence', 'Mary', 'find', 'out', 'adultery', 'complete', 'stranger', 'How', 'embarrassing', 'None', 'women', 'movie', 'had', 'Mary', 'best', 'interests', 'heart', 'Not', 'even', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'preserve', 'Mary', 'marriage', 'not', 'Mary', 'best', 'interest', 'do', 'so', 'couple', 'divorces', ""'ll"", 'be', 'job.Normally', ""'d"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'someone', 'Mary', 'shoes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'because', 'Mary', 'so', 'spineless', 'Not', 'only', 'share', 'blame', 'husband', 'adultery', 'also', 'treats', 'helpless', 'victim', 'too', '.as', 'had', 'other', 'choice', 'cheat', 'her.First', 'Mary', 'mistress', 'believing', 'mistress', 'came', 'strong', 'poor', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'Right', 'mistress', 'was', 'bully', 'who', 'forced', 'have', 'sex', 'her.She', 'then', 'fool', 'herself', 'demanding', 'mistress', 'let', 'husband', 'go', 'again', 'bully', 'holding', 'hostage.But', 'not', 'Mary', 'husband', 'entered', 'affair', 'own', 'free', 'will', 'was', 'choice', 'do', 'this.Mary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'even', 'end', 'when', 'caused', 'cheat', 'was', ""n't"", 'whole', 'woman', 'back', 'then', 'Now', 'whole', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'together', 'now.But', 'Mary', 'husband', 'did', ""n't"", 'cheat', 'what', 'Mary', 'lacked', 'cheated', 'what', 'lacked', 'ability', 'face', 'problems', 'head', 'so', 'poor', 'facing', 'problems', 'even', 'affair', 'leave', ""n't"", 'want', 'deal', 'mistress', 'anger.These', 'messages', 'disturbed', 'too', 'often', 'victim', 'who', 'unfairly', 'blamed', 'partner', 'adultery', 'movie', 'up', 'adulterer', 'very', 'casual', 'tone', 'here', 'concerning', 'adultery', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Mary', 'being', 'cheated', 'most', 'part', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'affected', 'Shortly', 'adultery', 'even', 'laughing', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'mom.The', 'message', 'female', 'viewers', 'too', 'should', 'just', 'shrug', 'adultery', 'off', 'minor', 'offense', 'just', 'forgive', 'as', 'quickly', 'Mary', 'does.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'pretty', 'bad', 'too', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'as', 'usual', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'who', 'usually', 'funny', 'also', 'was', 'Jada', 'Pinkett-Smith', 'who', 'most', 'miscast', 'here', 'seemed', 'really', 'self-conscious', 'role', 'was', 'cringe-inducing', 'watch', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'acting', 'came', 'off', 'only', 'everyone', 'else', 'performed', 'so', 'poorly.Overall', 'movie', 'went', 'bad', 'worse']","Women, The (2008) (DVD)"

Diane English has tried to make Clare Booth Luce's mid-1930's Broadway Play relevant to the 21st Century and that is just an impossible task.Ms. Luce wrote the play during a period when her husband was positioned in New York City. She was writing about the spoiled, self-centered, catty, gossipy society dames she had come to know and, of whom, she obviuously disapproved. This type of woman no longer exists unless you count people like Paris Hilton and Tinsley Mortimer and, who cares about them anyway? In the 1930's, this type of women were celebrities with reputations to uphold.Here's what's missing:Sidney's (Elizabeth Arden's)The Train to Reno. (We fly now).Miriam Aarons. (absorbed into Crystal Allen who has become a Soap Opera  Actress).The Dude Ranch (Replaced by a Health Spa).Lucy (absorbed into Cloris Leachman's maid).Buck Winston.Peggy (the naive newlywed).The Starlight Room.The re-union with Steven.These women all work. They all like one another. The cat fight has now been reduced to an argument on a street corner.Sylvia Fowler is now a nice woman played by Annette Bening who is too old for the part.Meg Ryan is gorgeous, but, you knew that.Eva Mendes is spectacular looking! What man wouldn't run after her?Candace Bergen recycles Murphy Brown.Cloris Leachman is good as always but she has nothing funny to say.Debra Messing is funny and plays not too bright but she's not as stupid or as mean as Phyllis Povah was in the original movie.Bette Midler, who would have been fabulous as the Countess has now become a predatory talent agent.Where is the sniping, gossip, mud-slinging, back biting and hair-pulling?This story is now PC and heartwarming.

But the other three secondary roles turn around Eva Mendes the seductive lover of Stephen Haines, (who looks fine in this role); the pregnant friend (who expects this birth with hope and illusion) and the lesbian character (who lives with a super model).New York is the big stage, the fashion world and its well known dissonances rounds an entire and passable film with a happy ending when the different destinies of these women intersect themselves.Curiously there's no single shot with a masculine character all the way through.

I say that both facetiously and seriously. The name ""Stephen Hanes"" is most often used in ""The Women,"" but he never appears. So, what is the message? Is there an easy answer to the problems between men and women? Not since Adam and Eve and that was a long long time ago.""The Women"" makes the statement that forgiveness is a dish best served with a back-up plan. Meg Ryan, in a more mature role than she normally plays, is the one married to Stephen Hanes, who, everyone discovers, is having an affair. Why, for crying out loud? Meg's character is pretty, can do anything around the house, is involved in charity events, and claims to be great in bed. (For one thing that puffed up, kinky hair annoyed the heck out of me. And what's up with her lips, or out, I should say--Meg has the new, yucky, puffy lip style now.) As her mother (Candice Bergen) tells her, men admire women who achieve on their own.So who's the man stealer? Eva Mendes in a hot, frankly--slutty role. She looks great! Does Meg keep a stiff upper lip (no pun intended) as her mother advises, or does she leave the scoundrel. Leave him she does and throws lives in chaos, particularly her daughter's, a tween.Three generations, three reactions to a marital break-up. At a weekend retreat Meg learns from an edgy Bette Midler to live selfishly. Ask: What do I want? That begins Meg's regeneration as an independent person, particularly as a fashion designer, her life's goal until she married.Other issues concerning women spring up in this mult-layered story:1. Annette Benning (looking worse than I've ever seen her--what's up with that flat head?) is Meg's best friend. Their friendship is ruptured as a result of the separation and must be mended. She plays the successful single friend whose career has hit its peak. This is another issue.2. Jada Pinkett Smith--in my honest opinion--plays the ""gay black"" friend. Her role in the movie did not feel authentic to me.3. Why in the world would the gorgeous Debra Messing play that last scene? It was so grotesque and utterly unnecessary!4. However, Candice Bergen's role as a matronly mother feels so right.4. And why would a director keep Cloris Leachman so tightly zipped? Wasted talent there.But the message is clear. Men are nice (sometimes), but they're really not to be trusted. (That statement also applies to hussies who leech married men of their time and money.)

This movie features some very good actresses, but the material is banal and completely lacking in depth.Meg Ryan plays a rich woman who spends her time doing ""fundraising,"" and although she has only one child, somehow requires a full-time housekeeper (Cloris Leachman) and au pere girl to keep it all going.Annette Bening, one of the greatest actresses ever, seems to be doing an exact impression of Samantha Jones from Sex and the City; someone should have reminded her that she's too old to play this sort of role. It's a fluff piece better suited to that nitwit Anne Hathaway.The strangest thing about this movie is the complete absence of any men. All the extras are women; in street scenes, there is not a man to be seen anywhere. This gimmick would be affective if the film were not so utterly void of substance. It's as though a statement is trying to be made, but when the whole plot is about Meg's unfaithful husband and how she ""wins"" him back, it becomes all the more irrelevent. And how does she win him back? By becoming a fashion designer and presenting her rather unoriginal inspirations in a typical flashy New York gala. It happens effortlessly; and suddenly she's loveable again and worthy of her husband's attention.Fashion is far more important than raising money for charities.Debra Messing's part is so appalling it isn't even worth mentioning, but the worn-out child bearing scene was nauseating. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the ill-cast token lesbian who has to be freaked out by all things baby related. The acting is over-the-top, and the whole plot is silly. Hands down, the only good scenes belong to Canadace Bergen, and whoever wrote her lines should have taken over the whole script because hers are the only ones with any substance or authenticity.Women in their late 40s and early 50s should not be in appalling films such as this. They should be portraying politicians, movers, shakers, thinkers - women who have lived, experienced, and are taken seriously outside the realm of men, money, and Gucci bags.

So, where does that leave the other famous actress on the cover?  Eva Mendes is the mistress.  Of course.  With those curves and that mouth... Fine, I can see why.But!  Meg Ryan's girls flock around her and push her to do the dirty work that she is usually too feeble to do.  She screams and swears and gets her nails done!  Meg Ryan has always been a little aloof in her movies, but I'd be okay to admit that this movie is one of her finer performances.  I think between her and Annette Benning, I'm hard pressed who made this film the measely 3 stars that it is.  Without them, the whole thing would have been a disaster.The story is overdone and we've seen all angles of this thing, but... I was willing to watch someone do it one more time.  ""The Women"" didn't show me anything new.  Nothing surprised me.  Meg Ryan did a stellar performance of being the doting and happy wife, to the angry and depressed, yet ANGRY adulteree (is that a word?).  I enjoyed watching her transformation.The director did not use Debra Messing's natural ability to entertain, make jokes (yes), but also to offer insight.  I usually enjoy Messing's work, but this one just left me thinking she is entirely too quirky and had no serious moments in the entire movie.  Jada Pinkett-Smith, I'll admit, I haven't seen her in many movies, but this one was overacted and I couldn't wait for her to get off the screen.  Obviously she isn't a street person in real life, but I am not supposed to know that, as the viewer.  Not a good performance at all.  The few times that Eva Mendes was on screen, she seemed surly and pouting, and at times bitchy- but rarely did I see her account for her actions- especially when Meg Ryan actually confronts her.  Eva is hardly in the movie at all, which for this particular film, is a blessing.  She would have only botched it up more.This gets a three stars.  If Meg Ryan and Annette Benning hadn't done such a great job, it would have gotten a two stars for the script writing and the others overacting.  It was bearable, but not something I will probably ever watch again.",3,Two Women Make it Worth It...

1156609,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0017ANAZO,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 3]","I enjoyed this remake of George Cukor's classic 1939 film.  While Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell headed an excellent cast in a sparkling film, Diane English does a good job bringing this update to the screen.  The DVD special features are informative as we hear about what a labor of love this was for English, the long fuse of financing and numerous screenplay drafts before the the project could be brought to screen.Meg Ryan plays Mary Haines whose husband is having an affair.  Ryan was one of the top romantic comedy starts in the 80s & 90s with great classics such as her Golden Globe nominated ""When Harry Met Sally"" & ""Sleepless in Seattle.""  She tugs at our heartstrings as the woman forced to come out of her shell and gain a better sense of herself.Annette Bening who I loved inOpen Rangeand who has been nominated for an Oscar three times for ""The Grifters,"" ""American Beauty"" & ""Being Julia"" does a good job as the anti-domestic career woman Sylvie Fowler.  This was Rosalind Russell's role in the original.  Bening is always interesting to watch.  Her scenes with Mary's daughter show variety and range.In the DVD extras, English said she questioned whether 82-year-old Cloris Leachman would be up to doing a role.  But Leachman, whose Oscar was for ""The Last Picture Show,"" glistens as the saucy housekeeper Maggie whose personal opinions keep her continually on the verge of quitting.Eva Mendes showed me what great depth she has an actress inWe Own the Night.  She may be one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood.  As Crystal Allen, the girl most willing to have an affair with a married man, she combines the elegance & barb of Joan Crawford with street sleaze.  Her scene in the dressing room trying on lingerie makes you want to scratch her eyes out.  She's a delight!Candace Bergen, who was nominated for an Oscar in 1979 for ""Starting Over,"" reflects great presence as Mary's mother Catherine Frazier.  In her scenes, we are treated to a sizzling cameo performance.  Bette Midler who has two Oscar nominations of her own (""For the Boys"" & ""The Rose"") plays Leah Miller, drying out with Mary.  She is intense, charming and flamboyant in her limited screen time.Debra Messing from TV's ""Will & Grace"" plays Edie Cohen, the eternally pregant friend of Mary's.  Her comic timing is great.  Jada Pinkett Smith as the gay Alex Fisher adds spice.  I enjoyed her as the maverick captain inThe Matrix Revolutions (2-Disc Widescreen Edition).  Debi Mazar does a great job as the brassy manicurist Tanya who loves to gossip.  Carrie Fisher from ""Star Wars"" has a brief scene on an exercise bike as reporter Bailey Smith.Overall, the film works well.  I hope it stimulates people to want to check out the great George Cukor film as well as Clare Boothe Luce's excellent stage play.

When it started I thought it seemed like it would be a short-half hour situation comedy.

Annette Bening is cast as a sophisticated career woman and in the first scene she goes for a manicure at Saks Fifth Avenue and hears the manicurist gossiping about Meg Ryan's husband who is having an affair with a girl who works at the perfume counter.  Annette tries to keep this information from her friend but eventually it comes out.  Meg Ryan looks beautiful in this role of a suburban housewife whose world seems to fall apart.  Candace Bergan is cast has her mother and her role is interesting too.Soon, I got involved in the story.  The characters were a bit overdone but I definitely related to them.  And I loved the happy ending too.Later, I discovered that this was a remake of a 1939 film which was supposed to be a real winner.

I thought this remake was excellent in its ability to adapt it to current lifestyles. As in both versions, one does not notice that there are no men in the film - and they are not missed! Meg Ryan was excellent as she was able to tone the overblown gestures and expressions used by Norma Shearer who never seemed to be able to distance herself from her old silent film days. (I always felt she got such juicy roles as this because she was married to MGM head Irving Thalberg. The 1939 film was over-budgeted, over-produced, and over-acted making for a campy movie to match Shearing's over-the-top style. Check out her version of ""Marie Antoinette"" [1938] - it so syrupy it'll give you diabetes!) Annette Bening's portrayal of Sylvia was superb as was Debra Messing. Eva Mendes totally captured the new millennium gold digger. Jada Pinkett Smith had the most difficult role as her character would have been the most scandalous and banned from the earlier film. These women were strong, intelligent, and independent in their own ways. Watching Meg Ryan come into her own was uplifting while Candace Bergen's revelations of a ""life unfulfulled"" was indicative of women of her era. All of the negative reviews here have no merit. This is well-written screenplay with an outstanding cast of women. Females watchers should learn to be open and supportive of a film with a female director and all female cast. Men can either take something positive from the film or not say anything negative at all since they obviously aren't able to understand the complex parts which make up a real woman of this time and this place.

1156615,A2MF2QVSCUI27G,B0017ANAZO,"Luan Gaines ""luansos""","[25, 32]","When Hollywood remakes a classic, it does so with a vengeance, in this case 1939s ""The Women"", a tale of New York socialite Mary Haines (Norma Shearer in 1939, Meg Ryan in 2008) whose husband is stolen by an opportunistic hussy. In the original, a careless gossip reveals a scandalous affair, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks poaching the man of a beloved, gentle woman and faithful wife. Like the current remake, no one suffers financial distress in either film. Where such movies served to distract a country burdened by the long years of the Depression, the 2008 version is nothing but a paean to Sex and the City and its ilk.The crisp, acerbic dialog that fed the drama of a heartless housebreaker determined to secure her future in 1939 has been watered down to support vague cameo appearances, but the context is lost in a twisted mess of improbable solutions and sloppy writing. When Mary Haines gathers with ladies in similar situations getting ""quickie"" divorces in Reno 1939, the modern group goes to a health farm, where Ryan smokes a joint with Bette Midler and ruminates on where she's gone wrong. While the first film offered fresh faces destined for long term stardom, Eve Arden, Paulette Goddard, Rosalind Russell and Joan Crawford, the new one is a rogue's gallery of cosmetically altered actresses, some more gruesome than others.Meg Ryan- sporting a mouth that is part Meg, part Calista Flockhart and part Michelle Pheiffer- sullies Shearer's former role with braggadocio about her performance in the bedroom (something about nails and boards) and a hapless Annette Benning apologizes for exposing her friend to the rabid tabloid gossip. Bette Midler makes a bold, if shocking cameo, as though she stumbled onto the wrong set. And what could be more absurd than casting Crawford's iconic role with the sultry Eva Mendes (the extent of her role is a few lines delivered in sexy lingerie or in a bath tub)? Sadly, the coming to self of a married woman still in love with an unfaithful husband becomes Ryan's tongue-in-cheek parody of a new identity, complete with Annie Lennox anthem in the background.For all the wasted efforts of such greats as Candice Bergin and Cloris Leachman, there are a few stellar moments: 5 stars to Annette Benning for a performance that transcends the vapid material, a short, but punchy role by Debi Mazar, the gossipy nail lady who spreads the rumors and a terrific one-liner by natural comedic actress Ana Gasteyer. In contrast, Jada Pinkett-Smith is a brash lesbian, Debra Messing's considerable talent is wasted, and Carrie Fisher? Well, she's just... Carrie Fisher.An iconic comedy of manners and the danger of gossip is turned into a frivolous chick flick in an effort that does no justice to the sophistication of the original in this uncomfortable ensemble piece. It says something about the state of filmmaking for actresses over forty when all the public is offered is this warmed up hash with neither plot nor substance, a sad commentary when talented actresses are forced to alter their faces to remain relevant in a youth-obsessed society.

The first thing one realizes is that movies today are better and the emotional freight is portrayed closer to reality than any of the movies of the contract studios ever were.  The encouragement with which the manicurist is enticed to divulge her secret is less catty than the earlier film, and the moment of understanding is more emotionally detached than the drama with which it was portrayed in the earlier film.  Detached in the sense that Ryan's character is stunned and in a traumatic funk rather than ""the betrayed woman.""  Then she is angry.  I remember the earlier film and the corny betrayal distress that was the major theme of that film.  Ryan infuses her role with angry humor and strength rather than weak femininity.I love seeing Meg Ryan in more mature roles now that she has gotten beyond the ingenue period.  Annette Bening is a superb foil as the close and angry friend.  A great cast.I am also much pleased to see that women are protrayed more realistically.  During the days of the contract studios, almost all roles, especially women's roles, were  stereotyped and all too often the caliber of acting was far below what we can see today.

But first a little story:Every year at the Castro theater (the oldest theater in California) in San Francisco's gay Castro district, the owner shows this film to a sold out crowd. You can barely understand the dialogue as every person in the audience repeats every single damn line in the movie after having watched it SO many times. Once you get into the party atmosphere, its pretty amazing. The lines are quick, sharp and bitchy and the audience never stops talking or laughing throughout. If you can catch this experience you'll save yourself from this remake.Meg Ryan (too pretty), Annette Bening (not believable), Jada Pinkett Smith (just mean), Eva Mendes (just mean), Debra Messing (Debra Messing redux), Cloris Leachman (great performance), Bette Midler (same Bette), Carrie Fisher (very brief), Joanna Gleason (okay), and Candice Bergen (well cast) sound like a cast that could only win in any film, but this remake is a dud.

If you've read through all the other bad reviews to find this one, than you already know about the mediocre performances, the bad performances, the truly painful performances, and Meg Ryan's self-mutilations--uh, I mean--her latest cosmetic surgery. You also know about the horrible script and boring, nonsensical dialogue. And you probably know that this is a remake of a famous classic from 1939. What hasn't been discussed is WHY this movie went so terribly wrong.The answer in my opinion rests squarely with Diane English, the butcher of this script. The original film, based on a play of the same name, was about a group of New York's ultra-rich, spoiled, self-obsessed, bitchy socialites getting embroiled in a no-holds-barred cat-fight over a man. It's a fun, sophisticated (for it's time) and hilarious film that still somehow  manages to be sympathetic to its characters. Cue Diane English, who had the brilliant (not!) idea of taking this script and turning into a warm and fuzzy tale of female empowerment-ala-Sex and the City. Presto! The bitchy socialites become successful modern career women (well, some of them anyway) who stick together and support each other when one of their clique is wronged by her husband and the &#34;other&#34; woman. And it might have worked, but English either lacked the skill or the confidence to depart from the original script and instead tried to marry it to her modern vision. The result is this infamous train wreck of a film in which everybody looks bad, and sound worse. Nobody is convincing in their roles, or even seems to understand their roles, and whatever 'message' English was trying to send gets buried in the confusion.",1,SO AWFUL IT WILL SERVE AS THE STANDARD OF BAD REMAKES FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,1746,"['Need', 'be', 'said', 'hated', 'movie', 'hated', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'bad', 'reviews', 'find', 'one', 'already', 'know', 'mediocre', 'performances', 'bad', 'performances', 'truly', 'painful', 'performances', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'self-mutilations', 'uh', 'mean', 'latest', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'also', 'know', 'horrible', 'script', 'boring', 'nonsensical', 'dialogue', 'probably', 'know', 'remake', 'famous', 'classic', '1939', 'What', ""n't"", 'been', 'discussed', 'WHY', 'movie', 'went', 'so', 'terribly', 'wrong.The', 'answer', 'opinion', 'rests', 'squarely', 'Diane', 'English', 'butcher', 'script', 'original', 'film', 'based', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'group', 'New', 'York', 'ultra-rich', 'spoiled', 'self-obsessed', 'bitchy', 'socialites', 'getting', 'embroiled', 'no-holds-barred', 'cat-fight', 'man', 'fun', 'sophisticated', 'time', 'hilarious', 'film', 'still', 'somehow', 'manages', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'Cue', 'Diane', 'English', 'who', 'had', 'brilliant', 'not', 'idea', 'taking', 'script', 'turning', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'tale', 'female', 'empowerment-ala-Sex', 'City', 'Presto', 'bitchy', 'become', 'successful', 'modern', 'career', 'women', 'well', 'anyway', 'who', 'stick', 'together', 'support', 'other', 'when', 'one', 'clique', 'wronged', 'husband', '34', 'other', '34', 'woman', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'English', 'lacked', 'skill', 'confidence', 'depart', 'original', 'script', 'instead', 'tried', 'marry', 'modern', 'vision', 'result', 'infamous', 'train', 'wreck', 'film', 'everybody', 'bad', 'sound', 'worse', 'Nobody', 'convincing', 'roles', 'even', 'understand', 'roles', ""'message"", 'English', 'was', 'trying', 'send', 'buried', 'confusion']","Women, The (2008) (DVD)"

Do yourself a favor and don't view this film or completely base your choice on whether or not to view it or buy it on reviews comparing it to the original. I viewed The Women, written and directed by Diane English, without any expectations. In this 21st century version, a group of four women, each a well-defined individual (although perhaps a bit stereotypical) reacts to and faces the topic of betrayal.Meg Ryan, Mary, is a Connecticut housewife and philanthropist, raising a child with the help of a live-in nanny and a housekeeper (Cloris Leachman). Mary learns her high-profile husband is having an affair with the gorgeous ""spritzer girl,"" played by the VERY hot Eva Mendes. She works at the Saks' perfume counter. Mary's friend, Sylvia (played by Annette Bening) is a between-relationships/childless/magazine editor. She actually learns of the infidelity first and shares the news with their other two friends. Jada Pinkett Smith is Alex, an author/lesbian and Debra Messing plays the fertile-mertyl of the group, Edie, who is pregnant . . . again. Along with Mary's mother, played by Candice Bergen, the friends do their best to try and get Mary through this difficult time. It's by no means a smooth ride and the friendship between Sylvia and Mary is particularly tested. I thought the substance of friendship dynamics rang very true.Definitely a chick-flick, but an intelligent one especially suited for middle-aged women.

1156621,A35FEM4C0LQTPN,B0017ANAZO,Mike Leone,"[8, 12]","Warning:  minor spoilers ahead.I found this remake of the 1939 film The Women to be quite enjoyable.  I was worried that it was going to purge all the bitchiness of the original, but some of that remained, and it is quite witty and clever in other places and ways.Even though it makes about as much sense to me to compare the two versions of The Women as it does to compare Massenet's Manon to Puccini's Manon Lescaut or Puccini's and Leoncavallo's versions of La Boh&egrave;me with each other, I'm going to do that anyway.  I'll say up front that I think there is room for both versions.Contrary to what is implied in the trailer, the remake has more in common with the original than I had first thought.  It carries over several lines from the original, including two of the very best lines.  There are places where it is obvious that they are setting up to bring over one of the original wonderful lines and those sequences are lots of fun because of the anticipation that the line is coming.  The best line from the original (the one about the kennel), on the other hand, shows up with almost no warning and in a very different place, spoken by a different character.The film doesn't follow the original scene-by-scene by any means.  There are some unusual plot twists such as having the phone call Crystal Allen gets at Saks Fifth Avenue, which is how it is known in this picture (as opposed to the thinly-disguised Black's in the original), take place at, rather than behind, the perfume counter, so that the women who are ""creeping up on her"" (this phrase is not carried over) get to witness the call.  Also the manicurist, who is called Tanya rather than Olga in this version, is brought back toward the end for an interesting plot twist.  There is a fashion show although in this version it is part of the story and not just a divertissement.  While the implication is there in the original that the writer character played by Jada Pinkett Smith has an alternative lifestyle, they leave no doubt of that in this version.There are differences, of course.  Bette Midler plays the fairly small part of the Comtesse de Lave, who goes by a different name, although she acknowledges that sometimes people call her ""The Countess.""  While Buck (different last name, which I don't recall) is mentioned, nothing really comes of that subplot other than the implication that the Comtesse may end up making him husband number six.  Buck never gets involved with Crystal either.  The biggest change is the character of Sylvie (rather than Sylvia) Fowler, who does not gloat over Mary Haines' sufferings; she feels genuine remorse at having played a part in the publication of the story of the fight between Mary Haines and Crystal Allen.  She is loyal to Mary Haines throughout the film, even during the disruption in their friendship, and so she never makes friends with Crystal Allen.  In fact, it could easily be argued--especially on the basis of one of Mary Haines' lines--that Mary's relationship with Sylvie is more important to her than her relationship with Stephen.  Little Mary obviously thinks very highly of Sylvie as well.  Then again, this is much more a pro-woman picture than the original.  It was probably influenced to an extent by Sex and the City from what I gather (I haven't seen it), so it only makes sense that the women would take their relationships with each other very seriously.  Another difference is that there is one male character in this version although it is entirely possible that that character is at least played by a female.Accordingly, since Sylvie and Crystal never become friends, Sylvie is not involved in the scene in Crystal's bathroom.  That scene, now only involving Crystal and Little Mary, brief as it is, tracks the original more closely than any other part of the film, or maybe it only seems that way because Eva Mend&eacute;s has obviously studied Joan Crawford and her speech patterns and reactions in that scene very closely.  There is another superfluous and not really believable--or maybe it is, in a way, given the way things are nowadays--plot twist involving Crystal, who otherwise does not reappear in the film after the scene in her bathroom, that comes out during the closing credits.I thought it bogged down a bit about two-thirds of the way through the film, and perhaps that was because that was the place where it diverged the most from the original.  On the other hand, there were certainly places where I found the lines funny or where I was completely engaged in the film where those sections had nothing to do with the original.I don't follow modern films that closely so I'll avoid detailed comments on the actresses.  I'll simply say that I thought the acting was good throughout and I really liked the girl who played Little Mary.  I wouldn't say she was better than the original, whose character and acting style was very much of that period.  The one actress in this film whose work I am familiar with is Debra Messing, from Will and Grace, and I must say that she has amazing breath control as is evidenced by the final scene.  The trailer made it look as though her role was much more prominent than it turns out to be, possibly to take advantage of her being possibly the best known actress of any in the film.  She is very important in the heartwarming ending, however.  Some of the important characters from the original are missing, such as those played by Paulette Goddard and Joan Fontaine.  Thre is no divorce ranch so there is no Marjorie Main either.  I wish the wonderful Carrie Fisher had had a larger role.Anyway, aside from the little bit of time where the film bogs down in the middle, the two hours went by pretty quickly.  The Women is certainly a better film than the reputation it has garnered.  Comparing it to the original film, I probably would have only given it four stars.  However, since I think the film stands well on its own without reference to the very different original (which I also love), I'm giving it five.",5,The New Women,1230422400,"12 28,

I think it is safe to say that if you are a big fan of the original film, then this 2008 remake will be a huge letdown. Women have come a long way since 1939 and despite the hilarity of the the original film, the characters (desperate acting women who will stop at nothing at keeping their man, even if he is a no-good cheater) seem cartoonish today. Of course a literal re-do would be ludicrous today. However, even with modern female sensibilities thrown into the script for the remake, a talented ensemble of actresses fail to ignite a stale script. Annette Bening is fun to watch and manages to trigger a few laughs but Meg Ryan is colorless in the lead role and Debra Messing is just irritating (and I usually like her!). Eva Mendes is gorgeous in the role initially done by Joan Crawford, but she isn't given much to do. Jada Pinkett Smith seems to have been thrown in as an afterthough and wonderful actresses like Cloris Leachman and Candice Bergman bring little to the table.On a positive note, this was my first blue-ray dvd experience, and I thought the sets, photography and art direction was first-rate.

Played by some of the finest actresses today we have a group of friends who stick together in good and bad: married woman with one child living in posh suburb in New York, woman with five children living in Queens, lesbian woman in search of long term companion, divorced career woman not so ready  to give herself to a new man, let alone a new family - and then their is a seductress woman whose job is to steal other women's men (or women) for that matter.  Amazing script that tells a story about the midlife crisis of a mid-age woman who with a little help of her girlfriends manages to find her own strength and re-define herself as she was almost 15 years ago.  This movie has no male characters, but will keep you on your toes.  Better yet, it is much better than any of the ""Sex in the City"" episodes (sorry I did not see that movie yet).  The fashion, jewelry, hairstyles and makeup are absolutely amazing.  It almost feels like perpetual ""Vanity Fair"" from start to finish.  The best line for me ever is when Annette Benning says to a child who cries in a department story ""Honey, no one hates Saks Fith Avenue"".  And it does not take a SFA regular to get that line!  I strongly recommend this movie for anyone - I am sure that even men will like it.

But, all the other women of this film were really too old to me to be able to embrace as an enjoyable film about women. Even Meg Ryan has lost her appeal to me and yet she is younger than me. I've always thought Jada Pinkett Smith was hot, but in this film, playing a bad-tempered lesbian kinda put me off. I've never understood the appeal of Debra Messing even when she was younger, and I've seen Annette Benning in a few films, either mature themed (The American President), or just in bad taste (American Beauty), so seeing her again (and older), just didn't capture my appeal very well. We never did see Meg Ryan's husband in this film. So, since no character development of him could be established, I guess it's easy to just make him the ""bad guy"" in this failing marriage. Meg Ryan even showed that she was too busy to help her own daughter with a school project so I had no pity for her role even if her husband did find a young hottie (like Eva Mendes) to fulfill the emptiness in his life. A neglected husband (or even a neglected wife) can easily stray towards someone who also needs some temporary affection. And, if a man's got money, there's no reason to resist temptation. I've heard it said: ""A man is only as loyal as his options.""For the age of these women who make up the star cast, even Bette Midler, Carrie Fisher, and Candice Bergen aren't all that much older than the main cast. If they needed an older woman in here for some kind of elderly influence, they really needed to seek out a silver screen dinosaur. That's where we get Cloris Leachman. For all we know, she could have been in the original 1939 version.This movie's appeal is right there between ""Designing Women"" and ""The Golden Girls"". Anyway, I saw it, and I wasn't too impressed, probably because I'm still too young to relate to any of these women's problems. They were all rather old, cold, and shallow. Of these women, what man could possibly be proud to say: ""This is my wife!"" ? Not me. I couldn't care about anybody in this film, and I tried. No wait, I did like Eva Mendes. No doubt about that!

Her busy schedule keeps her name on the lips of society and her daughter adores her, but it seems her husband is discontent. Steven Haines is having an affair with a perfume girl (Eva Mendes). Suddenly the gossip is out, and although her friends (Annette Benning, Debra Messing, Jada Pinkett Smith) try to help her deal with the pain of the situation, Mary decides to divorce her husband.The movie starts strong. The dialogue is witty, the characters are energetic and interesting, and the plot moves along nicely. It is updated to modern times flawlessly, and these girls resemble the famous friends from Sex in the City.Toward the end, however, the movie veers off into an alley of sentiment and turns into a full-on chic-flick. We see a woman become independent and powerful and achieve the dreams she never realized, made for audiences to shout ""You go, girl!"" in the background. Best friends have a fight and then cry together over their great relationship. It all culminates in a delivery room where women bond over the ability to have babies. Disgusting.Still, this re-make is superior to that starring June Allyson and Joan Collins which is much less exciting in spite of how cheesy this one becomes.It is always nice to see a great screen writer from the past appear in the credits of a film, even if it isn't a wonderful remake. However, it retains a lot of the great elements of the past. There are no men in his film, a gimmick ignored in the Allyson remake but a memorable part of the original. Also, the ""jungle red"" nail polish, the bathtub scene with Crystal Allen, and the lingerie scene (This one is quite a bit more risque).",3,"Starts Strong, Ends With Sappy ""Girl Power"" Sentiment",1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,1693,"['Mary', 'Haines', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'successful', 'housewife', 'busy', 'schedule', 'name', 'lips', 'society', 'daughter', 'husband', 'discontent', 'Steven', 'Haines', 'having', 'affair', 'perfume', 'girl', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'Suddenly', 'gossip', 'out', 'friends', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'try', 'help', 'deal', 'pain', 'situation', 'Mary', 'divorce', 'husband.The', 'movie', 'strong', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'characters', 'are', 'energetic', 'interesting', 'plot', 'moves', 'along', 'nicely', 'updated', 'modern', 'times', 'flawlessly', 'girls', 'resemble', 'famous', 'friends', 'Sex', 'City.Toward', 'end', 'however', 'movie', 'veers', 'off', 'alley', 'sentiment', 'full-on', 'chic-flick', 'see', 'woman', 'become', 'independent', 'powerful', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'never', 'realized', 'made', 'audiences', 'shout', 'go', 'girl', 'background', 'Best', 'friends', 'have', 'fight', 'then', 'cry', 'together', 'great', 'relationship', 'culminates', 'delivery', 'room', 'where', 'women', 'bond', 'ability', 'have', 'babies', 'Disgusting.Still', 're-make', 'superior', 'starring', 'June', 'Allyson', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'much', 'less', 'exciting', 'spite', 'how', 'cheesy', 'one', 'becomes.It', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'great', 'screen', 'writer', 'past', 'appear', 'credits', 'film', 'even', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'remake', 'However', 'lot', 'great', 'elements', 'past', 'are', 'men', 'film', 'gimmick', 'ignored', 'Allyson', 'remake', 'memorable', 'part', 'original', 'Also', 'jungle', 'red', 'nail', 'polish', 'bathtub', 'scene', 'Crystal', 'Allen', 'lingerie', 'scene', 'one', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'risque']","Women, The (2008) (DVD)"

1156641,ALP1DGLA2WWHJ,B0017ANAZO,Stephen Sanders,"[2, 5]","""A Female Friendship Film"" is what I would call ""The Women"". A weak remake of the 1939 classic.  I recently rented the DVD (glad I didn't go the movies to see this).  I tried not to compare the  two movies but it was hard not to.  The remake came up short...but if I don't compare them than it is an okay film.  The remake has a totally different feel from the original.  I would describe it as lame!  There is no energy, no drama, no face slapping or cat fights among the women.  They are BORING!  In the 1939 film every woman scratched her way to the top (wearing Jungle Red nail polish).Meg Ryan (Mary) has made a career in playing ""good girl"" roles.  She is good...no surprise there. Annette Benning is also good as Mary's best friend ""Sylvia"".  That's the problem...she is much more likable in this film.  Benning's ""Sylvia"" would have been much more interesting if she had been bitchier, flawed, with maybe some redemption thrown in at the end.  I did like the scene where Mary and Sylvia made up.  Eva Mendes (Crystal), who is the ""other woman"", should have been a BITCH!  She needed to show how conniving she is...a real GOLD DIGGER!  It would have been fun to see her act mean to ""poor Mary"".  I got a kick out of Cloris Leachman, as the housekeeper because she can do no wrong in my book.  She has made the best of her acting roles even when the parts were below her standard.The part that I did not think worked well was ""Alex"", Mary's ""lesbian"" friend (they had to make a point of making sure you knew she was gay and how the straight friends seem to tolerate it).  Jada Pinkett Smith can't act!  Her role would not have been missed if it had been cut out.  Debi Mazar, who played the gossipy manicurist can't act that well either.  Years ago she had a more interesting look (more severe) than she does now.  Bette Midler was GREAT in her bit part and it would have been greater if it had been BIGGER and she looked better.  They made her look old and tired.  Her talk was even slower.  What a waste ...but hey, it just shows that the Divine Miss M can do older, slower talking, dumpy looking characters...she's versatile!Diane English wrote and directed this film.  I can tell she is a nice person.  It shows in her film.  A gay man would have done a better job(at least a bitchy gay man).The ending was dumb.  Come on... Debra Messing (Edie) screaming in agony while giving birth and everyone is running around acting silly.Would I watch the remake again...no!

Having such a large assemblage of talented and attractive actors in one movie is  impressive.  The fact that Diane English, the creator of the groundbreaking comedy series ""Murphy Brown,"" is responsible for this new version of ""The Women"" is reassuring.  It is wonderful that she opened doors for as many capable women to work behind the scenes as in front of the camera for this movie.  This rarely happens today.  Another positive is the way that the women's onscreen relationships with one another have evolved from the backstabbing bitchiness of the 1939 original to a more loyal and compassionate nature in the 2008 remake.But there are obvious weaknesses in ""The Women"".  The characters in this updated version have the potential to be more complex and substantive than their predecessors.  Yet Diane English's script only scratches the surface of these women's identities.  There is scant detail about their individual lives, histories, and goals.  The characters are presented more as ""types"" than as three-dimensional women, i.e., Meg Ryan plays the good wife;  Annette Bening portrays the ambitious career woman;  Debra Messing is the frazzled mom;  Jada Pinkett Smith, the tough lesbian;  Eva Mendes, the man-eating home wrecker, etc.Credit the experience and resourcefulness of the superb acting ensemble  who manage to bring texture and depth to characters that the story fails to fully develop.  The genuine warmth and respect you feel between these talented actors off-camera enhance their onscreen relationships as well.Ms. English, whose writing for the classic comedy series ""Murphy Brown"" was truly masterful and funny, seems rusty here.  Her humor sometimes feels forced and occasionally falls flat.But Diane English deserves praise for bringing an all-female cast back to the big screen.  It's ironic that in the 21st century women supposedly have less value in movies than they did 70 years ago.

This device, although somewhat novel, probably limits the dramatic possibilities--as well as limiting the development of the principal male character: the husband of Meg Ryan's character!",2,"Potentially interesting problems ensue, but are too neatly resolved",1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,995,"['Meg', 'Ryan', 'wealthy', 'New', 'Yorker', 'world', 'upended', 'when', 'husband', 'affair', 'girl', 'who', 'perfume', 'counter', 'played', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'How', 'Meg', 'character', 'character', 'friends', 'learn', 'husband', 'infidelity', 'how', 'help', 'friend', 'face', 'problem', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'goer', 'however', 'Ryan', 'soon', 'able', 'realize', 'only', 'change', 'focus', 'life', 'pleasing', 'others', 'pleasing', 'instantly', 'meteoric', 'professional', 'personal', 'success', 'moral', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'effortlessly', 'who', 'are', 'rich', 'lucky', 'should', 'also', 'observe', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'movie', 'man', 'ever', 'seen', 'onscreen', 'voice', 'even', 'heard', 'phone', 'device', 'somewhat', 'novel', 'probably', 'dramatic', 'possibilities', 'as', 'well', 'limiting', 'development', 'principal', 'male', 'character', 'husband', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'character']","Women, The (2008) (DVD)"

I think the worst thing about the film was that it ended quite abruptly without any resolution.  When the credits began to roll, I was left feeling clueless.The film started out okay--the dialogue was alright and the acting was fine, and I was amused by Annette Bening's character.
