The anime is very good and it has a wonderful ending. The characters are deep and intriguing. The action kept me on the edge of my seat. But I'm a romantic at heart and there was plenty of human drama and sweetness, and enough comedy to balance out the heavy plot.I watched it in both English and Japanese. Daisuke and Satoshi I liked both in English and Japanese, but Dark I actually preferred in English. Risa I absolutely couldn't stand in English. Riku was fine in English, but I liked her better in Japanese. All the other characters were fine in either language.The only thing I didn't like about it was the inconsistency of the plot pacing. It seems to drag out for a long time with all the thefts, but when we get to the end, it just rushes into a conclusion. But is an overall good purchase.

943962,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B000BKSJ52,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","Daisuke Niwa is 14 years old. He is the next Phantom Dark. Each generation of Niwa males shares their body with the legendary thief, Phantom Dark. Phantom Dark is frowned upon by society as a common criminal. The public doesn't know that he actually steals cursed artwork and artifacts. The young Daisuke has a crush on Risa Harada. Risa only has eyes for the Phantom thief. The one who actually loves Daisuke is the older Harada twin, Riku. Now this dilemma seems simple to me. Tell them both that you are Niwa as well as Phantom Dark. Or just choose the sister you like and be with her. Personally, I think that Risa is a bit shallow and clueless. I would definitely go for the more sincere Riku. I'll let you watch and find out who the winner is. Anyway, for the bond between Dark and Daisuke to be broken, and their duty fulfilled 2 things must happen: 1. Daisuke must steal his sacred maiden, and 2. Dark must defeat his rival, Krad. The drama and action is very good. This series is very solid.D.N. Angel is a really good show. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are very good. You'll recognize the main characters. Vic Mignogna, Luci Christian, and Hilary Haag all play the major characters. There is a good mix of action, drama, romance, and comedy in this series. There are times when it seems to drag, and get into some unimportant story arcs. I think that the potential for this anime was higher than it actually achieved. If the useless arcs were used for relationship and character development, it could have reached its true potential and became a 5 star series. Because of those things, it was a solid 4 star series. I don't want to make it sound like this series was disappointing. It didn't disappoint. It was very good, and I'm glad I bought it. It's definitely a show that I'll revisit in the future. By no means is it one of the best anime series out there though.It does have another strong point that separates it from many other shows. While many anime series out there today are quite perverted and geared toward males. This is a very clean and wholesome show. The characters have very sweet and pure personalities. There isn't really any fan service; unless you count the beach trip episode. The language is very mild. These things are kind of nice to see in an anime. Boobs, perverts, and Yuri are very overdone themes in anime nowadays. Although I get a kick outta that stuff once in a while, it's not essential to a strong series. I like that D.N. Angel kept it clean. It's one that you can share with the whole family. It will even teach younger kids a few important lessons about love, friendship, and family.I apologize for rambling a bit. I had a lot to say about this show. In conclusion I recommend this series to all anime fans over the age of 8 or so. It's not the best series out there, but it's very solid and has some cute and innocent love and drama. I really enjoyed D.N.

943963,AFV2584U13XP3,B000BKSJ52,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[0, 0]",I thought this was very entertaining and heart-warming series and while it does have a somewhat darker story in the series for the most part it is very light-hearted.  The main character Daisuke Niwa is starting the new school year and is romantically interested in a girl named Risa Harada who has a twin named Riku and Riku is actually interested in Daisuke herself.  What you find out in the series also is that Daisuke's mother and grandfather train him at home to become not just a great thief but to try and release a family secret it seems that in Daisuke's family that the male members carry a supernatural winged powerful thief entity named Dark who when released takes control of the male family members body for awhile.  Dark is not evil but is somewhat mischievous and headstrong also it seems that the only way Dark can be released is when the male who's body he is dormant in starts to feel an a emotional strong feeling(Usually the emotion love)and that enables him to awaken and takecontrol of the body for awhile.  The series has episodes of the police and a special task force trying to capture Dark when he does his publicized thefts(The thefts when there going to happen and what time are usually told to the police in secret by Daisuke's family to both annoyand alarm the police.)  The series also has of course a romantic agenda to for Daisuke and a certain someone put in as well.  The series animation is clear and sharp and the Japanese and English audio were very good as well the set is pricey but sometimes it does go on sale or if youwant try checking out the local video stores this series is worth getting...,5,A Nice Light-Hearted Mix Of Lupin The Third And Romance,1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,1639,"['thought', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'heart-warming', 'series', 'have', 'somewhat', 'darker', 'story', 'series', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'light-hearted', 'main', 'character', 'Daisuke', 'Niwa', 'starting', 'new', 'school', 'year', 'romantically', 'interested', 'girl', 'named', 'Risa', 'Harada', 'who', 'twin', 'named', 'Riku', 'Riku', 'actually', 'interested', 'Daisuke', 'What', 'find', 'out', 'series', 'also', 'Daisuke', 'mother', 'grandfather', 'train', 'home', 'become', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'thief', 'try', 'release', 'family', 'Daisuke', 'family', 'male', 'members', 'carry', 'supernatural', 'winged', 'powerful', 'thief', 'entity', 'named', 'Dark', 'who', 'when', 'released', 'control', 'male', 'family', 'members', 'body', 'awhile', 'Dark', 'not', 'evil', 'somewhat', 'mischievous', 'headstrong', 'also', 'only', 'way', 'Dark', 'can', 'be', 'released', 'when', 'male', 'who', 'body', 'dormant', 'starts', 'feel', 'emotional', 'strong', 'feeling', 'Usually', 'emotion', 'love', 'awaken', 'takecontrol', 'body', 'awhile', 'series', 'episodes', 'police', 'special', 'task', 'force', 'trying', 'capture', 'Dark', 'when', 'publicized', 'thefts', 'thefts', 'when', 'going', 'happen', 'what', 'time', 'are', 'usually', 'told', 'police', 'secret', 'Daisuke', 'family', 'annoyand', 'police', 'series', 'also', 'course', 'romantic', 'agenda', 'Daisuke', 'certain', 'someone', 'put', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'animation', 'clear', 'sharp', 'Japanese', 'English', 'audio', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'set', 'pricey', 'go', 'sale', 'youwant', 'try', 'checking', 'out', 'local', 'video', 'stores', 'series', 'getting']",D.N.

943967,A10U58PHFDK81C,B000BKSJ52,The Anime  Adict,"[10, 13]","Now then let me first say that I've been a big fan of D. N. Angle since the manga was first previewed in new type four or five years ago. Add to this is that I've pretty much engraved every manga to come out into me perminately memory. I rented this series because I wanted to know how everything ended.D. N. Angle is a good series, no doubt but I'm having trouble reviewing this one objectively for a few reasons. One is I just can't help but compare the manga version to the anime version. Two is the differences annoy and infuriate me.Well lets start off the review with the englich voice acting which is good not great, I've heard better but it's descent. Two is animation, which is kind of odd, it his smooth but not fluid. This is probably because of the way it was directed with the camera constantly changing direction and refocusing of things, zooming in and out. Character designs are okay most are shallow but still somewhat likable. The music with all honesty was pretty good, not the best I've heard but still pretty good. The plot has quite a few twists that will keep you guessing. The ending felt rushed and lacking leaving you thinking wait that's it?Now as you have probably noticed I personally did not really like this show. Mostly because of the huge difference in the anime and manga. This is a review for everyone that's read the manga like me and are thinking about buying this one. First the focus' are completely different. The anime mainly focus' on Daisake being the phantom thief and pretty much breezes over everything else, mean most of the first half of the series is just him doing jobs. The relationships which are the focus of the manga don't really start until about half way threw and then at a snails pace. In the manga Risa is betrayed as a brave and devoted girl that though selfish does care about Riku, other then that a normal girl. In the anime Risa is betrayed as more of a selfish, flake leaving you wondering what Daisake saw in her. Also in the manga Satoshi and Daisake are rather close even stated that Satoshi feelings of friendship towards Daisake are what causes him to transform. Another huge difference is that in the manga Daisake's feelings for Risa are kinda glossed over where as his relationship with Riku though romantic is like a wine that gets richer with time. In fact the last manga to come out had him wanting to save Risa from her situation not so much for his own feelings for her but because of the suffering it caused Riku. In the anime it's the reverse Daisake spends most of his time crushing on Risa and ignoring Riku all together. Another difference is that in the manga Dark is a far more tragic character, being able to love but never truly being able to be loved in return and eventually losing his love to his best friend, the one he's possessing then disappearing never to see them again. Also Dark's and Daisake's relationhip is far different in the two versions. In the manga Daisake and Dark are rather good friends with most of the comedy stemming from the two jeering each other or trying to keep their secret when they keep transforming at awkward times. The two act more like brothers then anything. Another jarring difference in the versions is in the manga Daisake's klutziness is an act which Riku notices, he actually is quite agile and graceful as well as sensitive where as in the anime he's a complete klutz/bonehead. Also Daisake's dad is the resident art/legend know it all and shows up a lot more and generally is more of the help.Any way when everything's said and done I suggest you rent this one.

I'm going to give this a 4 star out of 5, simply because I first watched this when I was younger and thought the love was more intense in this anime as a child, then what it really was watching it as I was more mature and able to understand things more clearly. Though there is a love mix in this anime...its really focused on the Dark and the tale behind who he is and what he does/how he is perceived in society. The boy who winds up being dark this time around is a loving character and you fall in love with the characters very quickly. There is a bit of drama such as dark liking the girl that the other boy likes...but its very entertaining. I would buy it again. Only counting a star off because it lacked the nostalgia from what I remembered as a child..though that's not to say that this a very good anime.",4,4 out of 5,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,880,"['box', 'set', 'gorgeous', 'shelving', 'other', 'anime', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', '4', 'star', '5', 'simply', 'first', 'watched', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'thought', 'love', 'was', 'more', 'intense', 'anime', 'child', 'then', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'watching', 'was', 'more', 'mature', 'able', 'understand', 'things', 'more', 'clearly', 'love', 'mix', 'anime', 'really', 'focused', 'Dark', 'tale', 'who', 'what', 'perceived', 'society', 'boy', 'who', 'up', 'being', 'dark', 'time', 'around', 'loving', 'character', 'fall', 'love', 'characters', 'very', 'quickly', 'bit', 'drama', 'such', 'dark', 'liking', 'girl', 'other', 'boy', 'likes', 'very', 'entertaining', 'would', 'buy', 'again', 'Only', 'counting', 'star', 'lacked', 'nostalgia', 'what', 'remembered', 'child..though', 'not', 'say', 'very', 'good', 'anime']",D.N.
