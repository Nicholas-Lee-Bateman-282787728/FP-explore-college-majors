338804,A1OTGBG66P6K5Y,6302816505,"Amazon Customer ""MRD""","[34, 35]","What would a western directed by Alfred Hitchcock have looked like?  Odds are that THE STALKING MOON, starring Gregory Peck, would come close.Peck plays Sam Varner, a scout in the Southwest working to round up the last vestiges of the fierce Apache tribe.  Reluctantly he succumbs to the insistent appeals of a white woman (Eva Marie Saint), whom he has rescued from ten years of captivity among the Apaches, to take her and her half-breed son away from their makeshift camp.  The one detail that she withholds is that her husband and the father of the boy is the notorious, bloodthirsty and diabolical Apache warrior Salvaje. And you don't have to be historian to recognize that Salvaje is patterned after the real-life Apache warrior Geronimo.Without knowing of the carnage that Salvaje is reaping in the wake of his wife and son being taken from him, Varner takes the woman and child with him to New Mexico.  It isn't until Nick Tana (Robert Forster), Varner's friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute;, shows up and recounts all that has happened that Varner realizes that Salvaje is coming for the child, the woman and for him.The movie masterfully masks the warrior until the very end, increasing the intensity of its plot and suspense with every discordant strum of the guitars in the soundtrack.THE STALKING MOON is a must-see western.  Gregory Peck is wonderful and defines Varner as only he could.  Robert Forster and Eve Marie Saint are also terrific.

The vast majority of Westerns made in the 1940s to 1960s were the normal themes of good guy against bad guy with a little romance thrown in to boot. Once in awhile you got something a little different like men tracking someone or searching for someone but there wasn't a great deal of suspense, just lots of shooting. This movie is more like a Thriller than a Western. Gregory Peck and the rest the cast do a great job making the movie suspenseful. One reviewer mentioned it is like Hitchcock movie and indeed I agree, if Hitchcock had made a Western it would have been like this one. Peck plays a scout that has the job of escorting a woman and her half Indian son to safety. They are being pursued by a relentless Apache that is above average with his survival skills.

At the dinner table, for many years, one of my father's lines was, ""Please pass the peas!"" which is a reference to a monologue delivered by Peck in the film. Oddly, what spurred me to purchase the film, apart from an old memory and my father's adopting the peas line, was the discovery that the movie was filmed in Red Rock Canyon. I live in Las Vegas, and I've hiked Red Rock many, many times. Upon viewing the film, I immediately recognized the Mescalito, the pyramid-shaped sandstone peak that is the backdrop for his homestead. In fact, the Mescalito splits the Wilson Cliffs at this point into two small canyons, both named Pine Creek (north and south). I've hiked both, but have a preference for the north canyon. In any event, although I love this film, I cannot watch it without being distracted by every scene in which the Mescalito--and the Wilson Cliffs that frame it--appears. I will say that there are some awesome scenes of the Mescalito, including one that is sunny and especially colorful, and one or two in which the peak is enshrouded in mist. As something of an aside, I think many of the first scenes in the film, where Gregory Peck is scaling rocks, may have been filmed in the Calico Hills, which are also located in Red Rock Canyon. There is a glimpse of the Calico Hills in the film. Anyway, regardless of the beautiful distraction of one of my stomping grounds, I highly recommend this film.

338817,A33TAD81BE6SXA,6302816505,David Randolph,"[2, 2]","Like many others I waited for several years to see this movie come out on DVD. I have read that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was Peck's favorite film...and rightfully so. But I have also heard THE STALKING MOON was one of his favorites as well. This Gregory Peck collaboration with Mulligan is another very satisfying venture. Peck's sense of decency and willingness to do the right thing comes through, even if he is reluctant at first. While I rate MOCKINGBIRD as one of my top ten best movies of all time, I also rate STALKING MOON as one of my top five westerns. I stumbled across it on late night TV and eagerly sought it out on VHS. The story is simple, but extremely effective. One of the apsects of the film that enhances the action is the score...it just seems to fit every scene and adds to the growing tension. The film is often understated, but chilling. After repeated viewings, the only flaw I find is that Eva Marie Saint should have lost the eye make-up. All the characters ring true and Robert Forster contributes another strong performance. There are very few westerns that I watch again and again. SHANE comes to mind...and so does THE STALKING MOON. It sneaks up on you....and draws you in.

338830,A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG,6302816505,Kay's Husband,"[8, 8]","The movie was based on the 1965 Doubleday DD Western hardcover book by Theodore V. Olsen entitled THE STALKING MOON.  By mentioning that Sam's name in the book was 'Vetch', rather than 'Varner' as in the movie, one can correctly surmise there exist differences between the movie and the book.  Isn't that how it generally happens, though?Overall the movie is one of the best western movies I have ever watched, and I continually read western novels and watch western movies.  This time period in both Arizona and New Mexico, two states eventually made up from the older New Mexico Territory that came into existence after the Mexican War, were both pivotal to the Apache Wars of the late 19th century. In this case the sites of Lemming and Silverton play their roles as places leading to Sam Varner's ranch in the Soledad River valley. Both the Lemming and Silverton, New, Mexico, sites lead to gruesome killings and death as Salvaje continues to roam and raid the area on the way to kill Sam and Sara.The Apache Chief Salvaje, known as the Ghost, is running amok killing whites all across the Arizona/New Mexico area.  Some killings are indiscriminate while others are quite purposeful, especially where the woman Sara Carver and her Apache child, named Jimmie Joe in the novel but having a different name in the movie, are concerned. In the case of Sara and Sam, it is more a question of honor leading to fatal consequences for several innocent victims, Nic Tana among them. Plain and simple, Salvaje wants Sara and Sam dead, and his son back.  If one wonders how Salvaje gains entrance to the Sam's cabin late in the movie, it is because young Jimmie Joe lets him in.  The boy is much more a problem in the book than in the movie.For a western movie to really capture the panorama of a given area this film is quite unique. Never in all my movie watching, other than perhaps YELLOW SKY, have I seen such a grim, grimy, dusty, wind blown movie.  Until Sam and Sara escape the lowlands to move into the Soledad River country of New Mexico, wind almost continually blows dust and sand in every scene. Tough on both animals and humans, all the while backed up with the towerning, rugged mountain outcroppings at the Rica crossing and its foothills. Though the movie is portrayed as being in New Mexico, the film was actually shot on location in the Mojave Desert in Red Rock Canyon, Nevada.Another element in this movie adding both to the enjoyment and suspense is the lonely, eerie soundtrack by Fred Kaplin.  It is possibly a musical score that will remain with the watcher for a time long after the movie is over.Most watchers of this movie who enjoy westerns will have to give this production very high marks.  Its magnetic story draws me back again and again whether on DVD or when it shows on Encore westerns as it is doing this month, October, 2008.  For a late period western from Hollywood this yet remains one of the best and, for me at least, one of the best screen performances of Eva Marie Saint.Semper Fi.",5,CHASING THE 'GHOST',1224720000,"10 23, 2008",2008,3018,"['movie', 'was', 'based', '1965', 'Doubleday', 'DD', 'Western', 'hardcover', 'book', 'Theodore', 'V.', 'Olsen', 'entitled', 'THE', 'STALKING', 'MOON', 'mentioning', 'Sam', 'name', 'book', 'was', ""'Vetch"", 'rather', ""'Varner"", 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'correctly', 'surmise', 'there', 'exist', 'differences', 'movie', 'book', ""n't"", 'how', 'generally', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'western', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'continually', 'read', 'western', 'novels', 'watch', 'western', 'movies', 'time', 'period', 'Arizona', 'New', 'Mexico', 'two', 'states', 'eventually', 'made', 'up', 'older', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Territory', 'came', 'existence', 'Mexican', 'War', 'were', 'pivotal', 'Apache', 'Wars', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'case', 'sites', 'Lemming', 'Silverton', 'play', 'roles', 'places', 'leading', 'Sam', 'Varner', 'ranch', 'Soledad', 'River', 'valley', 'Lemming', 'Silverton', 'New', 'Mexico', 'lead', 'gruesome', 'killings', 'death', 'Salvaje', 'roam', 'raid', 'area', 'way', 'kill', 'Sam', 'Sara.The', 'Apache', 'Chief', 'Salvaje', 'known', 'Ghost', 'running', 'amok', 'killing', 'whites', 'Arizona/New', 'Mexico', 'area', 'killings', 'are', 'indiscriminate', 'others', 'are', 'quite', 'purposeful', 'especially', 'where', 'woman', 'Sara', 'Carver', 'Apache', 'child', 'named', 'Jimmie', 'Joe', 'novel', 'having', 'different', 'name', 'movie', 'are', 'concerned', 'case', 'Sara', 'Sam', 'more', 'question', 'honor', 'leading', 'fatal', 'consequences', 'several', 'innocent', 'victims', 'Nic', 'Tana', 'Plain', 'simple', 'Salvaje', 'Sara', 'Sam', 'dead', 'son', 'back', 'one', 'how', 'Salvaje', 'gains', 'entrance', 'Sam', 'cabin', 'late', 'movie', 'young', 'Jimmie', 'Joe', 'boy', 'much', 'more', 'problem', 'book', 'movie.For', 'western', 'movie', 'really', 'capture', 'panorama', 'given', 'area', 'film', 'quite', 'unique', 'Never', 'movie', 'watching', 'other', 'perhaps', 'YELLOW', 'SKY', 'have', 'seen', 'grim', 'grimy', 'dusty', 'wind', 'blown', 'movie', 'Sam', 'Sara', 'escape', 'lowlands', 'move', 'Soledad', 'River', 'country', 'New', 'Mexico', 'almost', 'continually', 'dust', 'sand', 'scene', 'Tough', 'animals', 'humans', 'while', 'backed', 'up', 'towerning', 'rugged', 'mountain', 'outcroppings', 'Rica', 'crossing', 'foothills', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'being', 'New', 'Mexico', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'location', 'Mojave', 'Desert', 'Red', 'Rock', 'Canyon', 'Nevada.Another', 'element', 'movie', 'adding', 'enjoyment', 'suspense', 'lonely', 'eerie', 'soundtrack', 'Fred', 'Kaplin', 'possibly', 'musical', 'score', 'will', 'remain', 'watcher', 'time', 'long', 'movie', 'over.Most', 'watchers', 'movie', 'who', 'enjoy', 'westerns', 'will', 'have', 'give', 'production', 'very', 'high', 'marks', 'magnetic', 'story', 'draws', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'DVD', 'when', 'Encore', 'westerns', 'doing', 'month', 'October', '2008', 'late', 'period', 'western', 'Hollywood', 'yet', 'one', 'best', 'least', 'one', 'best', 'screen', 'performances', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint.Semper', 'Fi']",N/A

Because of my fond memories surrounding the whole experience I decided to take a trip down memory lane and buy a copy. But I was dissapointed.This is the story of a woman, kidnapped by Indians as a child, who flees her Indian captors and husband of ten years along with her young son, a product of the union with her Indian husband. The woman's husband, The Stalking Moon, is determined to recapture her and their son and in the process, leaves a trail of death and destruction. Gregory Peck is the scout who takes pity on the woman and her boy by helping them navigate their path towards an ultimate return to society. No good deed goes unpunished.Eva Marie Saint as the fleeing woman is just to old, to hard looking (I'd say Eva was about a two pack a day smoker and the tee martooni type), too blonde and too 60s to be beleivable in this part. She looks old enough to be the boy's grandmother. This movie is slow. It's boring. It's badly cast and it's lifeless.

338833,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6302816505,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","I have read only two Western novels in my life.  The second was Larry McMurtry's &quot;Lonesome Dove,&quot; after seeing the televison mini-series, and the first was Theodore V. Olsen's &quot;The Stalking Moon,&quot; after seeing this 1968 film.  I have tried to think of whether there is really a common denominator between the two and while they share fine performances by Oscar winning actors and an attention to psychological conflicts, they are still rather different stories.Gregory Peck plays San Varner, a scout for the U.S. cavalry on his last mission, which is to round up some Apaches to take to the reservation.  This particular group follows Salvaje (Nathaniel Narcisco), the famed warrior who likes to hunt his enemies alone, using a Sharps buffalo rifle for long distance killing and a knife for up close and personal.  Salvaje is not among the group, but they do find Sarah Carver (Eva Marie Saint), a while woman who has been living with the tribe for some time, and her boy (Noland Clay), who happens to be the son of Salvaje.  After this final mission Varner is going to retire to his ranch in the mountains of New Mexico, while Sarah and her son are supposed to go East to find relatives.  But they both know that the pair will never find acceptance back there and Varner ends up taking them to New Mexico.After they settle Varner gets a visit from his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the half-breed scout Nick Tana (Robert Forster) to report that Salvaje has learned about what happened to his woman and child, and is leaving a trail of corpses across the Southwest making his way to the ranch.  The stage is then set for the deadly two-sided game of cat and mouse between these men.  Varner and Salvaje seem to be evenly matched, and one of the strengths of the film is that Salvaje is not portrayed as a typical villain: after all, he is coming to fetch his son.  Varner has to defned Sarah and the boy, even though it is not clear where their true loyalties lie in this conflict to the death.&quot;The Stalking Moon&quot; is a rather intimate western, with sparse dialogue; I think the longest speech in the film is when Nick shows up to deliver the exposition that sets up the rest of the film and Salvaje never says a word.  As the title implies, the action is based on intelligence and skill rather than just bigger and better guns.  The pacing is a tad slow, but that is rather appropriate to the story being told.  Of course it is hard to reconcile that this Peck and director Robert Mulligan working again after their great success with &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; which earned Peck his only Oscar and Mulligan his only Academy Award nomination.  Peck is once again playing a strong man forced to act alone, but this was never intended to be a literate script.  Actually, you might be reminded in Spielberg's strategy for &quot;Jaws,&quot; because Salvaje is more suggested than seen for most of the film, just like the great white shark.  &quot;The Stalking Moon&quot; is a solid Western rather than a great one, but that makes it pretty good all things considered.Final Note: I was surprised to learn my memory was faulty on this film and that Charles Bronson did not play Nick.  You can see why he would have been great in that role, but Bronson was busy that same year making my all time favorite Western, &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West.&quot;  So a tip of the cowboy hat to Robert Forster for his nice supporting role (when saloon keeper declared they did not serve half-breeds Nick would smile one of those killer smiles and suggest they serve the white half).",5,Gregory Peck goes mano e mano with the warrior Salvaje,1068076800,"11 6, 2003",2003,3598,"['have', 'read', 'only', 'two', 'Western', 'novels', 'life', 'second', 'was', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'quot', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'quot', 'seeing', 'televison', 'mini-series', 'first', 'was', 'Theodore', 'V.', 'Olsen', 'quot', 'Stalking', 'Moon', 'quot', 'seeing', '1968', 'film', 'have', 'tried', 'think', 'really', 'common', 'denominator', 'two', 'share', 'fine', 'performances', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'actors', 'attention', 'psychological', 'conflicts', 'are', 'still', 'rather', 'different', 'stories.Gregory', 'Peck', 'San', 'Varner', 'scout', 'U.S.', 'cavalry', 'last', 'mission', 'round', 'up', 'Apaches', 'take', 'reservation', 'particular', 'group', 'Salvaje', 'Nathaniel', 'Narcisco', 'famed', 'warrior', 'who', 'hunt', 'enemies', 'alone', 'using', 'Sharps', 'buffalo', 'rifle', 'long', 'distance', 'killing', 'knife', 'close', 'personal', 'Salvaje', 'not', 'group', 'do', 'find', 'Sarah', 'Carver', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'while', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'tribe', 'time', 'boy', 'Noland', 'Clay', 'who', 'be', 'son', 'Salvaje', 'final', 'mission', 'Varner', 'going', 'retire', 'ranch', 'mountains', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Sarah', 'son', 'are', 'supposed', 'go', 'East', 'find', 'relatives', 'know', 'pair', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'acceptance', 'back', 'there', 'Varner', 'up', 'taking', 'New', 'Mexico.After', 'settle', 'Varner', 'visit', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'half-breed', 'scout', 'Nick', 'Tana', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'report', 'Salvaje', 'learned', 'what', 'happened', 'woman', 'child', 'leaving', 'trail', 'corpses', 'Southwest', 'making', 'way', 'ranch', 'stage', 'then', 'set', 'deadly', 'two-sided', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'men', 'Varner', 'Salvaje', 'seem', 'be', 'evenly', 'matched', 'one', 'strengths', 'film', 'Salvaje', 'not', 'portrayed', 'typical', 'villain', 'coming', 'fetch', 'son', 'Varner', 'defned', 'Sarah', 'boy', 'even', 'not', 'clear', 'where', 'true', 'loyalties', 'lie', 'conflict', 'death.', 'quot', 'Stalking', 'Moon', 'quot', 'rather', 'intimate', 'western', 'sparse', 'dialogue', 'think', 'longest', 'speech', 'film', 'when', 'Nick', 'up', 'deliver', 'exposition', 'up', 'rest', 'film', 'Salvaje', 'never', 'word', 'title', 'implies', 'action', 'based', 'intelligence', 'skill', 'rather', 'just', 'bigger', 'better', 'guns', 'pacing', 'tad', 'slow', 'rather', 'appropriate', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'course', 'hard', 'reconcile', 'Peck', 'director', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'working', 'again', 'great', 'success', 'quot', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'quot', 'earned', 'Peck', 'only', 'Oscar', 'Mulligan', 'only', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Peck', 'once', 'again', 'playing', 'strong', 'man', 'forced', 'act', 'alone', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'literate', 'script', 'Actually', 'might', 'be', 'reminded', 'Spielberg', 'strategy', 'quot', 'Jaws', 'quot', 'Salvaje', 'more', 'suggested', 'seen', 'most', 'film', 'just', 'great', 'white', 'shark', 'quot', 'Stalking', 'Moon', 'quot', 'solid', 'Western', 'rather', 'great', 'one', 'pretty', 'good', 'things', 'considered.Final', 'Note', 'was', 'surprised', 'learn', 'memory', 'was', 'faulty', 'film', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'Nick', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'role', 'Bronson', 'was', 'busy', 'same', 'year', 'making', 'time', 'favorite', 'Western', 'quot', 'Once', 'Time', 'West.', 'quot', 'tip', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'nice', 'supporting', 'role', 'when', 'saloon', 'keeper', 'declared', 'did', 'not', 'serve', 'half-breeds', 'Nick', 'would', 'smile', 'one', 'killer', 'smiles', 'suggest', 'serve', 'white', 'half']",N/A

338846,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6302816505,Robert Morris,"[78, 80]","Note: Finally (!), this film will soon be available in a DVD format.One of my several diversions is to compile different kinds of lists of films. For example, one is of under appreciated and probably seldom-seen westerns. This one is on the list. Directed by Robert Mulligan (who received an Academy Award for his brilliant directing of To Kill a Mockingbird), The Stalking Moon follows a classic plot line: good guys flee from one or more bad guys who pursue them until the final, inevitable confrontation. (Sound familiar?) In this instance, retired U.S. cavalry scout Sam Varner (Gregory Peck) agrees to assist with the rescue of prisoners from their Apache captors in Arizona Territory. For reasons best revealed during the course of the film, Varner assumes responsibility for Sarah Carver (Eva Marie Saint) and her 9-year son whose natural father is Salvaje (Nathaniel Narcsisco), an Apache warrior chief. They are accompanied by Nick Tana (Robert Forster), another cavalry scout who is half-breed and (in effect) Varner's adopted son. Unseen by us until the final confrontation (Mulligan's use of stealth is brilliant), Salvaje pursues them with rage and precision, killing everyone he encounters along the way. In the role of Varner, Peck demonstrates many of the same qualities we associate with him off screen as well as with his portrayal of Atticus Finch: dignified, intelligent, sensitive, practical, and decent. Of course, after a ten-year association with Salvaje, Sarah Carver fully understands what they are all up against. Meanwhile, their son's loyalty is obviously to his father. The final scenes are set in and near Varner's cabin in New Mexico to which he was in the process of retiring, intending to live his remaining years in peace and tranquility.Again, I want to comment briefly on the fact that Salvaje is unseen by us until near the end of the film. This strategy increases substantially the progressive sense of terror we feel, as do Varner and his companions (except the boy). On occasion, the power of suggestion is far greater than anything we can visualize. Hence the prevalence of darkness in most horror films as well as the use of sounds (e.g. a child's scream, a gunshot, the release of a trap door on a scaffold during a public hanging), sounds  with which we associate rather than actually see a physical object. As we watch The Stalking Moon, we JUST KNOW that Salvaje is nearby. His skills at stealth are even more impressive, given the fact that both Varner and Tana were cavalry scouts with years of experience. Special credit is also due to Charles B. Lang for the cinematography, to Aaron Stell for editing (in collaboration with Mulligan), and to the three art directors. Their talents are seamlessly integrated. For these and other reasons, I obviously think highly of this film. It has modest objectives and fully achieves them. Gregory Peck once confided that this was one of his favorite films. Once having seen it, we understand why.",5,Eminently Worthy of Greater Appreciation,1058918400,"07 23, 2003",2003,2985,"['Note', 'Finally', 'film', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', 'format.One', 'several', 'diversions', 'compile', 'different', 'kinds', 'lists', 'films', 'example', 'one', 'appreciated', 'probably', 'seldom-seen', 'westerns', 'one', 'list', 'Directed', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'who', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'brilliant', 'directing', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Stalking', 'Moon', 'classic', 'plot', 'line', 'good', 'guys', 'flee', 'one', 'more', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'pursue', 'final', 'inevitable', 'confrontation', 'familiar', 'instance', 'retired', 'U.S.', 'cavalry', 'scout', 'Sam', 'Varner', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'assist', 'rescue', 'prisoners', 'Apache', 'captors', 'Arizona', 'Territory', 'reasons', 'best', 'revealed', 'course', 'film', 'Varner', 'responsibility', 'Sarah', 'Carver', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', '9-year', 'son', 'natural', 'father', 'Salvaje', 'Nathaniel', 'Narcsisco', 'Apache', 'warrior', 'chief', 'are', 'accompanied', 'Nick', 'Tana', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'cavalry', 'scout', 'who', 'half-breed', 'effect', 'Varner', 'adopted', 'son', 'Unseen', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Mulligan', 'use', 'stealth', 'brilliant', 'Salvaje', 'rage', 'precision', 'killing', 'everyone', 'way', 'role', 'Varner', 'Peck', 'many', 'same', 'associate', 'off', 'screen', 'as', 'well', 'portrayal', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'dignified', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'practical', 'decent', 'course', 'ten-year', 'association', 'Salvaje', 'Sarah', 'Carver', 'fully', 'what', 'are', 'up', 'Meanwhile', 'son', 'loyalty', 'obviously', 'father', 'final', 'scenes', 'are', 'set', 'Varner', 'cabin', 'New', 'Mexico', 'was', 'process', 'retiring', 'intending', 'live', 'remaining', 'years', 'peace', 'tranquility.Again', 'want', 'comment', 'briefly', 'fact', 'Salvaje', 'unseen', 'end', 'film', 'strategy', 'substantially', 'progressive', 'sense', 'terror', 'feel', 'do', 'Varner', 'companions', 'boy', 'occasion', 'power', 'suggestion', 'far', 'greater', 'anything', 'can', 'visualize', 'Hence', 'prevalence', 'darkness', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'use', 'sounds', 'e.g', 'child', 'scream', 'gunshot', 'release', 'trap', 'door', 'scaffold', 'public', 'hanging', 'associate', 'rather', 'actually', 'see', 'physical', 'object', 'watch', 'Stalking', 'Moon', 'JUST', 'KNOW', 'Salvaje', 'nearby', 'skills', 'stealth', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'given', 'fact', 'Varner', 'Tana', 'were', 'cavalry', 'scouts', 'years', 'experience', 'Special', 'credit', 'also', 'due', 'Charles', 'B.', 'Lang', 'cinematography', 'Aaron', 'Stell', 'editing', 'collaboration', 'Mulligan', 'three', 'art', 'directors', 'talents', 'are', 'seamlessly', 'integrated', 'other', 'reasons', 'obviously', 'think', 'highly', 'film', 'modest', 'objectives', 'fully', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'once', 'confided', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Once', 'having', 'seen', 'understand', 'why']",N/A

I realize that the stalker forced his advances on the woman, but the son is completely innocent.

(On a related note, please, will someone wake the people up at TCM and AMC and ask that they stop showing the same dozen movies over and over again?  There are many gems like this one just waiting to be seen.)  The story is a precursor to ""The Terminator,"" as a retiring cavalry scout (Peck) unwittingly incurs the wrath of an implaccable Apache warrior after agreeing to escort to safety the white woman who escaped his clutches.  What follows is a bloody, cross-country battle of wills pitting the scout's experience against the warrior's sheer determination to reclaim what he believes is his.  A young Robert Forster does a fine turn as Peck's bi-racial sidekick and all-but son.

338855,A3QYHR31DF3YN6,6302816505,Strawgold,"[4, 5]","""Stalking Moon"" is a trip down memory lane - back in time on a ""dusty stagecoach trace""  to the days of the Old West films.  Gregory Peck and Eva Marie Saint star in this story of a white woman captured by an Apache tribe and found years later when the cavalry captured the village, a small child by her side .  The small half-breed boy is torn between two ideas, that of staying with his mother and going with strangers he cannot understand, or that of waiting for his brutal Apache father to catch up with them and take them back to the only way of life he has ever known.The story is one of unlikely and uncertain relationships among people, and it is done with sensitivity and direction;  Eva Marie Saint cast as the displaced and victimized white woman, Gregory Peck as an honorable man who has completed a stint in the Cavalry as a scout - lucky to be alive and is ready to hang it all up and go back to the little homestead he has carved out of the New Mexico wilderness.  An old prospector friend is waiting patiently there for him, hoping to be of use around the place in his old age, and hoping against hope that life will now be peaceful.  Peck also counts among his unusual compadres another half-breed youth whom he took under his wing at one time, and the young man has sense enough to know that he was treated with respect by this good man - in a world where the half-breed usually found none.  This bonding comes in handy later on for Peck, but not so for the youth.  The woman is terrified of her Apache husband, whom she knows is following them with a blood wish, and will stop at nothing to take his boy back to his homeland.  Peck, with his habit of taking people under his wing (he can't understand it himself), ends up with them all and of course the happy ending cannot come for some of them.The photography is beautiful; a Southwest setting of barren deserts and plains melding into a magnificent rock canyon that embraces a little creek as it flows past the open meadow where the homestead lies.  It was a wonderful evening's entertainment if one has a passion for Western movies that are well written and well executed.",4,Unfulfilled Legacy,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,2145,"['Stalking', 'Moon', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'back', 'time', 'dusty', 'stagecoach', 'trace', 'days', 'Old', 'West', 'films', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'star', 'story', 'white', 'woman', 'captured', 'Apache', 'tribe', 'found', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'cavalry', 'captured', 'village', 'small', 'child', 'side', 'small', 'half-breed', 'boy', 'torn', 'two', 'ideas', 'staying', 'mother', 'going', 'strangers', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'waiting', 'brutal', 'Apache', 'father', 'catch', 'up', 'take', 'back', 'only', 'way', 'life', 'ever', 'known.The', 'story', 'one', 'unlikely', 'uncertain', 'relationships', 'people', 'done', 'sensitivity', 'direction', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'cast', 'displaced', 'victimized', 'white', 'woman', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'honorable', 'man', 'who', 'completed', 'stint', 'Cavalry', 'scout', 'lucky', 'be', 'alive', 'ready', 'hang', 'up', 'go', 'back', 'little', 'homestead', 'carved', 'New', 'Mexico', 'wilderness', 'old', 'prospector', 'friend', 'waiting', 'patiently', 'hoping', 'be', 'use', 'place', 'old', 'age', 'hoping', 'hope', 'life', 'will', 'now', 'be', 'peaceful', 'Peck', 'also', 'unusual', 'half-breed', 'youth', 'whom', 'took', 'wing', 'one', 'time', 'young', 'man', 'sense', 'enough', 'know', 'was', 'treated', 'respect', 'good', 'man', 'world', 'where', 'half-breed', 'usually', 'found', 'none', 'bonding', 'handy', 'later', 'Peck', 'not', 'so', 'youth', 'woman', 'terrified', 'Apache', 'husband', 'whom', 'following', 'blood', 'wish', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'take', 'boy', 'back', 'homeland', 'Peck', 'habit', 'taking', 'people', 'wing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'up', 'course', 'happy', 'ending', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'them.The', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'Southwest', 'setting', 'barren', 'deserts', 'plains', 'melding', 'magnificent', 'rock', 'canyon', 'little', 'creek', 'open', 'meadow', 'where', 'homestead', 'was', 'wonderful', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'one', 'passion', 'Western', 'movies', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'executed']",N/A
