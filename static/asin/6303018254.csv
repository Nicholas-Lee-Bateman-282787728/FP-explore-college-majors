Max Dire (more wolf pun names), is a down-on-his-luck police detective. With a series of tragic events threatening to overwhelm him, Max gets involved with a therapy group whose leader is a werewolf (the Howling anyone?)At first intrigued by the group, Max soon learns that these officers mean business - they're injecting werewolf blood to fight crime.Okay, if you're like me, you might think the plot of this movie sounds cool. Werewolves as 'good guys?' A horror/police action movie? Well, I think again. The movie has some decent special effects, but THAT'S ALL. The script is poorly handled, the dialog amateurish, and the acting like cardboard. If you want a good 'werewolf movie' see dog soldiers.
