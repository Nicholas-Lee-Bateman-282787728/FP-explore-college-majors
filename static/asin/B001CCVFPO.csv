It allows you to learn in sets instead of all at once. A great DVD for beginners. The way they show the poses in different ways is especially helpful. Would highly recommend.,4,Great DVD,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,268,"['great', 'way', 'learn', 'Bikram', 'privacy', 'own', 'home', 'can', 'be', 'challenging', 'learn', 'sets', 'instead', 'once', 'great', 'DVD', 'beginners', 'way', 'show', 'poses', 'different', 'ways', 'especially', 'helpful', 'Would', 'highly', 'recommend']",The Barkan Method: Hot Yoga

Haakmeester ""Yoga Muse""","[96, 98]","I have been reading up on Yoga for a while and discovered Bikram Yoga after an article about Jenny McCarthy and her experience doing it at her home. I looked into classes and either it didn't work with my schedule or they were very pricey.I have several books but wanted a DVD that went through the movements to get the feel of the flow of this particular style of Yoga. I also wanted a challenge and something that would make me work.Well, this DVD does all that. What I like about it is that it has the tutorial which goes through each movement with lots of detail. Also it has a feature during the class section. All you have to do is click on it and it will bring you right to the tutorial if you need some more detail, which is pretty cool.I definately think the reviews that state its not a power workout or the fact you won't sweat are a bit misleading. If you do this workout the way you are supposed to in a ""hot"" room, and you continue to challenge yourself going further with each movement you will sweat.For me I just use a portable heater and turn the fans off, and that creates a perfect enviroment. I don't know if its the ideal temp which I believe is slightly over 100 degrees, but I think as long as its warm enough to work a sweat that is the key thing, as you could really hurt yourself otherwise. I would think a humidifer would work as well to create the enviroment too.Also I saw that there was a complaint about it not being detailed, which is a bit misleading as well. With the tutorial and the ability to reference it during the class, I think it's very detailed for a DVD. I think if someone is look to delve into the finer, nitty gritty details, then I would would suggest to purchase a book as well. I have done that myself and I think that is key to learn about this form of yoga in the fullest sense.Anyway, I will definately use this DVD as part of my regular routine. It's a great economic alternative to classes and if you challenge yourself you will feel and see the results.",5,A Great Find!,1240617600,"04 25, 2009",2009,2010,"['have', 'been', 'reading', 'up', 'Yoga', 'while', 'discovered', 'Bikram', 'Yoga', 'article', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'experience', 'doing', 'home', 'looked', 'classes', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'schedule', 'were', 'very', 'pricey.I', 'have', 'several', 'books', 'wanted', 'DVD', 'went', 'movements', 'get', 'feel', 'flow', 'particular', 'style', 'Yoga', 'also', 'wanted', 'challenge', 'something', 'would', 'make', 'work.Well', 'DVD', 'What', 'like', 'tutorial', 'movement', 'lots', 'detail', 'Also', 'feature', 'class', 'section', 'have', 'do', 'click', 'will', 'bring', 'right', 'tutorial', 'need', 'more', 'detail', 'pretty', 'cool.I', 'definately', 'think', 'reviews', 'state', 'not', 'power', 'workout', 'fact', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sweat', 'are', 'bit', 'misleading', 'do', 'workout', 'way', 'are', 'supposed', 'hot', 'room', 'continue', 'challenge', 'going', 'further', 'movement', 'will', 'sweat.For', 'just', 'use', 'portable', 'heater', 'turn', 'fans', 'perfect', 'enviroment', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ideal', 'temp', 'believe', 'slightly', '100', 'degrees', 'think', 'as', 'long', 'warm', 'enough', 'work', 'sweat', 'key', 'thing', 'could', 'really', 'hurt', 'otherwise', 'would', 'think', 'humidifer', 'would', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'create', 'enviroment', 'too.Also', 'saw', 'was', 'complaint', 'not', 'being', 'detailed', 'bit', 'misleading', 'as', 'well', 'tutorial', 'ability', 'reference', 'class', 'think', 'very', 'detailed', 'DVD', 'think', 'someone', 'look', 'delve', 'finer', 'nitty', 'gritty', 'details', 'then', 'would', 'would', 'suggest', 'purchase', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'done', 'think', 'key', 'learn', 'form', 'yoga', 'fullest', 'sense.Anyway', 'will', 'definately', 'use', 'DVD', 'part', 'regular', 'routine', 'great', 'economic', 'alternative', 'classes', 'challenge', 'will', 'feel', 'see', 'results']",The Barkan Method: Hot Yoga

1175656,A13PSNTSS4T0C0,B001CCVFPO,yogabear,"[4, 15]","No new poses or interesting flows.  Barkan narrates the video.  The tutorials are not great compared to many other dvds.  FYI, Deb Dobin has a nice tutorial section.  Unless you put the heat on 95 degress or higher, this class is likely to cause injuries to beginners especially because their bodies won't be hot enough to perform a couple of the poses.  That being said; it is NOT an intermediate dvd.  I used a space heater and did it when I was not feeling well and it still bored me.  It should have ended at 30 minutes, not 65.  I have many yoga dvds for all levels; ranging from 30 to 90 minutes that put this to shame.  I wish I could get my money back.But I gave it 2 stars because it's a good pace for a heated room; just a not a great practice.  A few times he throws out words about engaging bandhas but doesn't give explanation of how.  The woman on the dvd has red hands and feet; which grossed me out.  The transition from standing poses to floor poses is really bad.  No inversions either.You are better off just using a beginner yoga dvd or a slower paced one and putting the heat on.P.S. I think the body should create some heat on it's own; not just because of the heater.  This dvd does not deliver on that end; so save your money.P.S.S.
