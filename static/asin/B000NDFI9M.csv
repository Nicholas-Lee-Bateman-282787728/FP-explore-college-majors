Such is the case with this movie.  The acting is not bad from actors like Robert Carradine, Dennis Hopper, Michael Madsen and C. Thomas Howell...those guys are good actors, but the script is lousy.  This is just a mess of a movie.  Basically, ""Hoboken Hollow"" is an attempt to cash in on the success of movies like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", but there is only one ""TCM"" and that is the original ""TCM"", and ""Hoboken Hollow"" is not TCM.  There is no atmosphere, mood, theme or suspense to this movie.  The action is lifeless and uneven.  In short, ""Hoboken Hollow"" is a movie about a family that kills people just like the TCM family, but it just doesn't work here at all.  All you have in this movie is a bunch of blood, torture and gore signifying much ado about nothing.  What a shame...what a worthless waste of acting talent.",1,"0.25 STARS: Love the cast, hate the movie.

The subject matter was scary as it involved the toughest of human emotions. From rage, insanity, aggressiveness and brutality, this movie did a great job of highlighting just how brutal human beings can be to one another. Dennis Hopper did a great job in the film and all of the actors were great in their roles. The setting as well as the actors really made the film spooky. With all of the horror films out today it is hard to find one that is still scary.

1056323,A18IQME5DCSH2L,B000NDFI9M,"Madelyn Pryor ""Goblyn Queen""","[3, 7]","Hoboken Hollow is yet another `based on true events' slasher movie that isn't really based on true events, and is just another faded copy of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (I know that Chainsaw is loosely based on Ed Gein as is Psycho. That's as close to true events as this movie comes). This movie is yet another story of hitchhikers being picked up, taken to a farm, tortured and cannibalized. The cops are in on the whole thing (just like Texas Chainsaw) and in the end you end up just not caring.This movie has some decent actors, like Michael Marsden and Dennis Hopper. They're in it for so few minutes they don't really add any spice to the movie. The acting itself isn't bad for such a movie, and the directing isn't bad, just indifferent. The story itself is tired in most places, and hollow in others. What I mean by that is some of the characters have issues that are mentioned, then never developed or not resolved, or completely ignored. Characters are murdered with little explanation before or after, which leaves the viewer scratching their head. Also, the subplot of Marsden's character wanting to buy the farm isn't developed too much either.The torture/murder scenes are disturbing and if you enjoy watching those things, it might be worth viewing just for that. They are horrific, perhaps not as much as Hostel, but it's still enough to make the average person turn away in abject disgust. But if you're looking to watch a movie for any reason other than the torture scenes I would make another selection. This movie just isn't that good. Try watching the original Texas Chainsaw or even the remake of The Hills Have Eyes again.Not recommended because of choppy plot, a recycled story, and uninteresting development of characters.",2,Nothing New Here...,1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,1743,"['Hoboken', 'Hollow', 'yet', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'slasher', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'just', 'faded', 'copy', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'know', 'Chainsaw', 'loosely', 'based', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'Psycho', 'as', 'close', 'true', 'events', 'movie', 'movie', 'yet', 'story', 'hitchhikers', 'being', 'picked', 'up', 'taken', 'farm', 'tortured', 'cannibalized', 'cops', 'are', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'end', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'not', 'caring.This', 'movie', 'decent', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Marsden', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', ""'re"", 'so', 'few', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'spice', 'movie', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'such', 'movie', 'directing', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'indifferent', 'story', 'tired', 'most', 'places', 'hollow', 'others', 'What', 'mean', 'characters', 'have', 'issues', 'are', 'mentioned', 'then', 'never', 'developed', 'not', 'resolved', 'completely', 'ignored', 'Characters', 'are', 'murdered', 'little', 'explanation', 'viewer', 'scratching', 'head', 'Also', 'subplot', 'Marsden', 'character', 'wanting', 'buy', 'farm', ""n't"", 'developed', 'too', 'much', 'either.The', 'torture/murder', 'scenes', 'are', 'disturbing', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'things', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'viewing', 'just', 'are', 'horrific', 'perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Hostel', 'still', 'enough', 'make', 'average', 'person', 'turn', 'away', 'abject', 'disgust', ""'re"", 'looking', 'watch', 'movie', 'reason', 'other', 'torture', 'would', 'make', 'selection', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'Try', 'watching', 'original', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'even', 'remake', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'again.Not', 'recommended', 'choppy', 'plot', 'recycled', 'story', 'uninteresting', 'development', 'characters']",N/A

If, however, you'd like a modicum of plot, character, story and competent acting to go with it, you might like to take your business elsewhere.Various transients pitch up at a farm where the owners imprison and enslave their workers, and, in a limping hour or so, with no discernible story-line, are - you guessed it - tortured and killed.  The film-makers seem to think their lame, predictable punch-line (I can't dignify it with the word 'twist') makes up for the rotten film preceding it.What in God's name is the woman playing Lois doing?  She seems to think she's playing Widow Twanky at Bognor Playhouse.  Is she supposed to be a funny character?  Why does the Michael Madsen character show no surprise and ask no questions when he is told the skeleton in the mother's closet is kidnap and murder?  What are respectable actors like Dennis Hopper and Madsen doing in this mess anyway - was someone holding their loved ones hostage on a real torture-farm or something?It's tempting to over-bash a bad film just to be clever, so I will  say Madsen, Hopper and Connery are as skilful as the script allows, as for the most part were all the 'victims'.  It's mainly the villains who turn in those pantomime performances.The voiceover says that sometimes people stay in terrible situations because they have nowhere else to go.  If that was the case with the real-life events 'inspiring' this cack, it's a pity the movie-makers did not explore that theme and make a more realistic, interesting movie instead of going for the gore-bore option.Incompetent and lazy and lacking in imagination.",1,A mess.,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,1737,"['just', 'see', 'people', 'being', 'tortured', 'killed', 'want', 'see', 'close-ups', 'organs', 'blood', 'severed', 'limbs', 'knock', 'out', 'however', ""'d"", 'like', 'modicum', 'plot', 'character', 'story', 'competent', 'acting', 'go', 'might', 'like', 'take', 'business', 'elsewhere.Various', 'transients', 'pitch', 'up', 'farm', 'where', 'owners', 'imprison', 'enslave', 'workers', 'limping', 'hour', 'so', 'discernible', 'story-line', 'are', 'guessed', 'tortured', 'killed', 'film-makers', 'seem', 'think', 'lame', 'predictable', 'punch-line', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dignify', 'word', ""'twist"", 'up', 'rotten', 'film', 'preceding', 'it.What', 'God', 'name', 'woman', 'playing', 'Lois', 'doing', 'think', 'playing', 'Widow', 'Twanky', 'Bognor', 'Playhouse', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'character', 'Why', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'character', 'show', 'surprise', 'ask', 'questions', 'when', 'told', 'skeleton', 'mother', 'closet', 'kidnap', 'murder', 'What', 'are', 'respectable', 'actors', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Madsen', 'doing', 'mess', 'anyway', 'was', 'someone', 'holding', 'loved', 'ones', 'hostage', 'real', 'torture-farm', 'something', 'tempting', 'over-bash', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'be', 'clever', 'will', 'say', 'Madsen', 'Hopper', 'Connery', 'are', 'as', 'skilful', 'script', 'most', 'part', 'were', ""'victims"", 'mainly', 'villains', 'who', 'turn', 'pantomime', 'performances.The', 'voiceover', 'sometimes', 'people', 'stay', 'terrible', 'situations', 'have', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go', 'was', 'case', 'real-life', 'events', ""'inspiring"", 'cack', 'pity', 'movie-makers', 'did', 'not', 'explore', 'theme', 'make', 'more', 'realistic', 'interesting', 'movie', 'instead', 'going', 'gore-bore', 'option.Incompetent', 'lazy', 'lacking', 'imagination']",N/A
