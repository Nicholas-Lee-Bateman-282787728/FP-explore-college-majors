In fact, watching the film tonight my entire family WAS in love with the movie.There's a couple things about the movie that separate it from being your typical/predictable family film.  Even though the build up in the beginning of the movie might lead someone into thinking they'll know exactly what kind of story to expect (because, let's be honest- most dog movies are pretty muh the same) the fact that the film showcases quite a bit of creativity involving the dogs and their talents and behaviors plays an essential part in making Hotel for Dogs a near classic.What's amazing about the film is how there must be over 20 different breeds of dogs, each with their own personality being given a fair amount of time.  Surely enough time for you to fall in love with whatever breed tickles your fancy the most.You can tell these aren't ordinary dogs either- the dogs showcased in Hotel for Dogs display a distinct talent and discipline that certainly shows they were trained quite hard before the film.  Alright, so the film DOES mainly focus on one dog (the small white one) but the other dogs get a pretty impressive amount of attention as well.  As you probably know, most dog films tend to focus on one dog while the rest of the dogs serve as small background material, or filler.  Hotel for Dogs stands apart from your ordinary family dog movie with the many dog varities being featured, and I admire that.Anyway, enough rambling.  This film is GREAT!  It's about a bunch of dogs that live in a rundown apartment building unbeknownst to everyone living around the area.It's an extremely good movie.  I'm honestly surprised it turned out to be *this* good because the movie writers obviously devoted more time to this movie than most writers would.  So much attention was given to each individual dog... I'm just amazed by that.Big dogs, small dogs, heavy dogs, cute dogs and one VERY ugly little dog that's extremely funny, haha.  I love the variety.The story also focuses on the two kids who discovered the dogs, both foster kids going from home to home and never actually settling in one place.Hotel for Dogs is mostly a fantastic film because it mainly focuses on the dogs who run around acting crazy, doing funny and silly tricks, and the storyline has a lot of creativity dealing with the kids who fix up the apartment and make it suitable for dogs to feel comfortable living there.  I recommend this movie to absolutely everyone, especially dog lovers.  It's funny, cute and great.",4,great family movie,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,2608,"['Hotel', 'Dogs', 'not', 'really', 'just', 'childrens', 'movie-', 'adults', 'can', 'easily', 'fall', 'love', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'watching', 'film', 'tonight', 'entire', 'family', 'WAS', 'love', 'movie.There', 'couple', 'things', 'movie', 'separate', 'being', 'typical/predictable', 'family', 'film', 'Even', 'build', 'up', 'beginning', 'movie', 'might', 'lead', 'someone', 'thinking', ""'ll"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'story', 'expect', 'let', 'be', 'honest-', 'most', 'dog', 'movies', 'are', 'pretty', 'same', 'fact', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'creativity', 'involving', 'dogs', 'talents', 'behaviors', 'plays', 'essential', 'part', 'making', 'Hotel', 'Dogs', 'near', 'classic.What', 'amazing', 'film', 'how', 'must', 'be', '20', 'different', 'breeds', 'dogs', 'own', 'personality', 'being', 'given', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'Surely', 'enough', 'time', 'fall', 'love', 'breed', 'fancy', 'most.You', 'can', 'tell', 'are', ""n't"", 'ordinary', 'dogs', 'either-', 'dogs', 'showcased', 'Hotel', 'Dogs', 'display', 'distinct', 'talent', 'discipline', 'certainly', 'were', 'trained', 'quite', 'hard', 'film', 'Alright', 'film', 'DOES', 'mainly', 'focus', 'one', 'dog', 'small', 'white', 'one', 'other', 'dogs', 'get', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'amount', 'attention', 'well', 'probably', 'know', 'most', 'dog', 'films', 'tend', 'focus', 'one', 'dog', 'rest', 'dogs', 'serve', 'small', 'material', 'filler', 'Hotel', 'Dogs', 'apart', 'ordinary', 'family', 'dog', 'movie', 'many', 'dog', 'varities', 'being', 'featured', 'admire', 'that.Anyway', 'enough', 'rambling', 'film', 'GREAT', 'bunch', 'dogs', 'live', 'rundown', 'apartment', 'building', 'unbeknownst', 'everyone', 'living', 'area.It', 'extremely', 'good', 'movie', ""'m"", 'honestly', 'surprised', 'turned', 'out', 'be', '*this*', 'good', 'movie', 'writers', 'obviously', 'devoted', 'more', 'time', 'movie', 'most', 'writers', 'would', 'So', 'much', 'attention', 'was', 'given', 'individual', 'dog', ""'m"", 'just', 'amazed', 'that.Big', 'dogs', 'small', 'dogs', 'heavy', 'dogs', 'cute', 'dogs', 'one', 'VERY', 'ugly', 'little', 'dog', 'extremely', 'funny', 'haha', 'love', 'variety.The', 'story', 'also', 'two', 'kids', 'who', 'discovered', 'dogs', 'foster', 'kids', 'going', 'home', 'home', 'never', 'actually', 'settling', 'one', 'place.Hotel', 'Dogs', 'mostly', 'fantastic', 'film', 'mainly', 'dogs', 'who', 'run', 'acting', 'crazy', 'doing', 'funny', 'silly', 'tricks', 'storyline', 'lot', 'creativity', 'dealing', 'kids', 'who', 'fix', 'up', 'apartment', 'make', 'suitable', 'dogs', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'living', 'there', 'recommend', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'everyone', 'especially', 'dog', 'lovers', 'funny', 'cute', 'great']",N/A

Bounced around from home to home, they have always found a way to feed and shelter their dog, Friday. Their foster parents, two self absorbed rocker wannabes (Lois & Carl Scudder played by Lisa Kudrow & Kevin Dillon), wouldn't dream of letting them keep the dog, so they resort to resourceful ways to feed and shelter Friday.Sometimes the things they do aren't exactly legal, but Bernie (Don Cheadle), their Social Worker, knows that they are good kids. He's working hard to find them a good home, but it is hard to find homes for older kids, and it is hard to find foster parents who won't break up the siblings. They are more than just another file in his over swollen in-box. You can tell he really cares about them.Andi and Bruce befriend a pet store worker who gets them to take in a few more strays, and then they discover an abandoned hotel with even more strays. The pet store workers (Johnny Simmons & Kyla Pratt) and a kid named Mark (Troy Gentile) all join in to fix up the abandoned hotel for the dogs. Bruce is a mechanical genius, and he creates all manner of crazy contraptions to amuse, feed, and care for the dogs.Contraptions hurl tennis balls for dogs that like to fetch. Doors rigged with doorbells and knockers are great for dogs that like to bark whenever visitors approach. Treadmills with bones on ropes hovering just beyond the dog's reach get them to exercise. Mechanical sheep keep the herding dogs busy. The feeding contraptions are quite outlandish: dog bowls on a conveyor belt are filled up and then each bowl parks in front of each dog seated at a large dining table.This scene, as you can imagine, was quite challenging because the dogs would see the food and just leap onto the table. In the film, it looks like they are all quite civilized; but you know from the bonus material that there were tons of dog trainers all just out of the camera shot shouting commands at their respective canines. Madness, sheer madness. The sound had to all be dubbed in later, and so much kudos go to the Foley artists and sound designers.All goes well at the Hotel for Dogs until the machines malfunction just before dinner time. Dog anarchy breaks out, and the barks, the howls, and the chaos alert the dog catchers (Ajay Naidu & others) to their location. The jig is up. Will they ever break out of dog jail? Stay tuned.This movie nabs you from the start with an opening sequence seen from behind the eyes (and nose) of Friday. This masterfully done cinematic sequence simulates Friday's acute dog senses that lead him to his target: a juicy hot dog.Cosmo and two other dogs (his stunt and photo doubles) portray Friday, and they are all quite accomplished canine thespians. Friday says so much with just his eyes. One look from them is worth a thousand words. His barks, though non verbal, also speak volumes. One of the dogs on Team Friday is most often seen from behind, because he is such an enthusiastic tail wagger. Cosmo was a rescue dog, and not four months before filming was languishing in the pound, his immense talent untapped and unappreciated.The dogs all have distinct and likeable personalities. Lenny, a Bullmastiff, is a loveable lug who howls if he can't look out the window. Georgia is a Boston Terrier, the sort of dog Betty Boop would own. Cooper, an English Bulldog, has a marvelously ugly face and chews up everything that is not nailed down, so Bruce makes him a vending machine that dispenses old shoes. Shep is a Border Collie with a strong instinct to herd. At one point he circles Andi and Dave, the pet store worker, shepherding them closer together like some kind of crazy canine cupid. Romeo is a Chinese Crested Dog -- kind of a Chihuahua on a very bad hair day -- and he makes a very unlikely Romeo for Juliet, a beautiful white Poodle. Soon though Romeo has won us and his Juliet over with his irresistible personality, his charm and his unorthodox beauty.Nearly 70 dogs were used for the making of this film, many of which were actually rescued from the pound. Several of them were adopted by crew members after filming wrapped.With a title like ""Hotel for Dogs,"" the story practically writes itself. Lois Duncan, who wrote the book, was very pleased with the resulting film -- unlike what happened with her ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" intended as a young adult mystery but filmed as a slasher flick. Though ""Hotel for Dogs"" was renovated, she felt it remained true to her story's spirit. She likes what they've done with the place.And what's not to like? You've got cute kids, cute dogs, and an abandoned hotel filled with cute Rube Goldberg gadgets. The stray dogs, the foster kids, and even the abandoned hotel, they are all orphans -- neglected but with so much to offer, if one would only take the time. ""Hotel for Dogs"" also has a lot to offer. Please don't neglect it. Unless you really hate dogs, children, and well made films, you will enjoy it.Nancy Drew(2007) ....

1238989,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001UJIMFK,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 11]","""Hotel for Dogs""--based on the book by Lois Duncan--is a cute kids film, but it's so grossly implausible that it's hard to focus on anything else. It tells the story of a group of kids that rescue stray dogs from the inner city and house them in an abandoned hotel. It's a fun idea, but as hard as I tried to suspend my disbelief, as much as I wanted to escape into pure fantasy, my brain would not stop analyzing the logistical issues this film never bothers to address. Maybe I'm too old for a movie like this. Then again, maybe it has nothing to do with age; a film geared towards children doesn't automatically have to preposterous beyond all reason. The people behind ""Hotel for Dogs"" seem to be taking the exact opposite viewpoint, and I find that very problematic. Kids will laugh at the jokes and fall in love with the dogs, but I seriously doubt they will believe that anything happening in the story is even remotely possible.We're introduced to a teenage girl named Andi (Emma Roberts) and her younger brother, Bruce (Jake T. Austin), who have been foster children since the death of their parents some years earlier. Their social worker, Bernie (Don Cheadle), now has them living in Central City (Los Angeles in real life) with wannabe rock musicians Lois and Carl Scudder (Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillion), who don't care about the siblings one bit. For a couple of years, Andi and Bruce have been hiding ownership of an adorable Jack Russell terrier named Friday by keeping him in alleys, garages, and curbs; because the kids aren't given an allowance, they have to pay for dog food by scamming people, and this usually involves putting a rock in a cell phone box, covering the box in shrink-wrap, and taking it to the pawn shop. They haven't always gotten away with it, however, and Bernie is always there to cut them a break. But his patience is understandably wearing thin.When Andi, Bruce, and Friday find themselves at odds with the law, they hide in a condemned hotel, where they discover two other stray dogs. The next day, when the siblings go to buy food for the dogs, they meet two young pet shop employees, Dave (Johnny Simmons) and Heather (Kyla Pratt), who then follow the siblings to the hotel and offer to help them care for the dogs. So does Mark (Troy Gentile), a teenage boy that has a crush on Heather. At this point, we learn that Bruce is an inventor, and when its decided that the hotel be converted into a dog shelter, he concocts a number of elaborate devices that cater to a dog's basic needs.And now the questions begin. How were the kids able to turn the electricity and the water back on? Isn't it convenient that a condemned hotel just happens to have furniture, abandoned clothing, and even the old ledger from the front desk? Where exactly is Bruce getting his supplies? His foster parents accuse him of stealing from them late in the film, but I seriously doubt he relied on them for movie projectors, screens, fans, and detached car doors and seats, all of which are used to simulate the experience of going on a drive with the window rolled down. And while we're on the subject, who actually found stock footage of a highway shot from a moving vehicle? Where was it found?The questions pile up as more strays are taken in. Where did the kids find an empty vending machine, and how were they able to fill it with things for a dog to chew on, like slippers and such? How is it they have enough money to provide the dogs with food? How did they set up the dining hall, which has a miniature train set pulling a series of dog bowls down the length of a massive table? When a dog has to use the restroom, it squats over an open hole and goes into a blue shrink-wrap bag, which is then carried along a conveyer belt, down a pipe, and into a dumpster: How were the dogs trained to go to one specific place for a restroom break? Do the kids really think that tossing dog waste into a dumpster is an adequate way to keep things clean? Furthermore, where did the conveyer belt come from? Or the blue shrink-wrap bags?I think I've made my point. I'm probably looking too deeply into this, but come on, this is unrealistic even for a fantasy. It doesn't help that all the adult characters are flat, shallow caricatures. Carl and Lois are uncaring and clueless. Dogcatchers are ugly and vindictive. A young man sitting at a park bench is selfish, refusing to let Friday have his hot dog. The only exceptions to this are Bernie and his wife, who are kind, earnest, and accommodating. The kids, on the other hand, are plucky and fresh-faced, which I guess is appropriate given the kind of story being told. Still, it would have been nice to add a bit more depth to these characters. Other than the siblings, Dave, Heather, and Mark and extraneous, serving no real purpose other than to be humorous companions. And I never really bought the puppy love developing between Andi and Dave--if there's anything this story doesn't need, it's a whitewashed teenage romance.If there is a saving grace for ""Hotel for Dogs,"" it's the fact that the dogs are loveable characters in their own right. It also promotes pet adoption and humane treatment. But that leads me to another thing about this story that bothers me: What about a hotel for cats?

1238991,A1OVYZPXPB0RKB,B001UJIMFK,"C.J. Darlington ""Author of Thicker Than Blood...","[3, 4]","Ever since Rin Tin Tin and Lassie America has loved a good dog flick. Some have made us laugh (The Ugly Dachshund), some have made us cry (Old Yeller, Marley & Me), others are just plain fun (Beverly Hills Chihuahua). Nickelodeon/ Dreamworks' Hotel For Dogs falls into this category. Even though it's officially a comedy, there's still some real life thrown in.Siblings Andi (Emma Roberts) and Bruce (Jake T. Austin) have been in and out of foster homes since their parents died, and up to now they've managed to stay together and keep their dog, a scruffy Jack Russell terrier named Friday, a secret. But the bubble's about to burst. When Friday's picked up by the dog catcher and they barely get him back, they realize he deserves a real home. They can't hide him in parks and behind dumpsters forever. Then one night Andi and Bruce stumble upon an old abandoned hotel, and the adventure begins.In the vein of 2003's Good Boy (minus the talking dogs), Hotel for Dogs hits all the right notes in the balance of humor, mayhem and drama. Thankfully the film makers resisted the temptation to elicit laughs from potty jokes alone, although there's still a few appropriate gags involving doggie doo-doo that'll please the younger set. The ingenious inventions created by Bruce, like an automatic assembly line dog feeder, car ride simulator, and some hilarious mechanical sheep keep our disbelief thoroughly suspended, but they're also what make this film fun and kid-friendly.Even though Hotel For Dogs' take-away is never heavy-handed, the subtle message of love for the unwanted, whether they be dogs or kids, isn't lost on viewers. It's a touching theme and the film's more serious element. But let's face it. We're watching Hotel for Dogs for the dogs. And there are enough of them here to fill a . . . er, hotel. Breeds all over the AKC map make appearances, but a Boston Terrier, Mastiff, Bulldog, Border Collie, and a Chinese Crested Hairless take center stage alongside lead dog Friday (played by a shelter rescue named Cosmo) who steals the spotlight even from his young human stars. Which isn't to say Roberts and Austin don't put on a great performance. Roberts, known for her roles in the films Nancy Drew and Aquamarine, plays the ideal older sister who wants to be the voice of reason but shares her brother's soft spot for pups. It won't be long before she's known for much more than being Julia Roberts' niece.A few tense thematic moments involving the pound and stray dogs being put down (a dog is led out the back door rather roughly by one of the dog catchers and later the man returns alone) could be troubling to younger or extra sensitive viewers. I heard a parent whispering to their concerned child once or twice behind me in the theater. But aside from this, Hotel for Dogs is a wonderful movie the whole family can enjoy together. Be sure to watch the ending credits featuring the cast and crew with their real-life pets.--Reviewed by C.J.

1238992,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001UJIMFK,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","If you are a dog person, this film will be a joy. If you are a cat person, well best look elsewhere. Cute kids, cute dogs, mean adults (save Don Cheadle), a run down hotel - recepie for a fun movie.Bruce and Andi are orphan brother and sister. Bernie loves these two kids and tries to place them in a foster home together. Their latest home is not exactly nurturing, so the two turn toward the street and stray dogs. The stray they have had for a number of years, runs away from the dog catcher into an abandoned hotel. Eventually Bruce and Andi save many dogs and take care of them in this hotel. Bruce is 11 and happens to be brilliant at mechanical engineering.Giving nothing away in this story, it's the evil dog catchers, the evil adults / foster parents, the not so bright police, versus the super smart kids.It's a pleasant film, made better if you love dogs. It's very predictible. The cast is interesting. Don Cheadle as Bernie, has had much better roles, but he made do with the script he was given (Traitoris a hugely better film with Cheadle). Emma Roberts is sweet, pretty, and smart (Nancy Drew) - expect to see much more and better from her. Her brother, Bruce is played by a very capable Jake T. Austin. Kyla Pratt (Dr. Doolite 4 - Tail to the Chief) is a friend of the group, has probably peaked as an actress. The horrible singer and even worse strict mother is played by Lisa Kudrow (Pheobe on Friends), has been awful (this time also) in a series of not so good movies lately. Troy Gentile is the overweight kid that joins the group about half way through the film. He doesn't do a very good job here, but you may remember him in Tenacious D and Nacho Libre. Aside from Kudrow, a pretty decent cast.Oh and don't forget the dogs. All shapes, sizes, breads, and ages. There's a dog in here that everyone will love.Film wise - well the focus was always on, and camera movement was solid (not much handheld garbage). The sound was well recorded - dialog was clear. The editing was decent, it could use about a solid 10 minutes removed of the hour 35 minute film, but who's counting. There were some strange CG effects that made the movie look other worldly off and on. It's not clear if that was the point or they didn't spend enough money on the effects. The doves flying off at the end were just too far over the top.Rated PG. There's a fair amount of poop humor (that was 5 things, no poop and pee are one thing, no I've stepped in them both and they are two things). There is a scene in the pound where a dog is taken to the back of the room on a leash. There is a cut to a few other scenes. Then the film comes back to the man with an empty leash reentering the room. For young children, that might require a bit of explaining. Otherwise, no violence, no strong language, and certainly no nudity. A film for all ages.The DVD is chock full of the usual efluvia of more or less useless bonus features. In fact there is likely an hour or more of these features.A nice family film for dog lovers.",4,"Dog Lovers, Meet at the Hotel",1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,3013,"['are', 'dog', 'person', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'joy', 'are', 'cat', 'person', 'well', 'best', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Cute', 'kids', 'cute', 'dogs', 'mean', 'adults', 'save', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'run', 'down', 'hotel', 'recepie', 'fun', 'movie.Bruce', 'Andi', 'are', 'orphan', 'brother', 'sister', 'Bernie', 'two', 'kids', 'tries', 'place', 'foster', 'home', 'together', 'latest', 'home', 'not', 'exactly', 'nurturing', 'two', 'turn', 'street', 'stray', 'dogs', 'stray', 'have', 'had', 'number', 'years', 'away', 'dog', 'catcher', 'abandoned', 'hotel', 'Eventually', 'Bruce', 'Andi', 'save', 'many', 'dogs', 'take', 'care', 'hotel', 'Bruce', '11', 'be', 'brilliant', 'mechanical', 'engineering.Giving', 'nothing', 'away', 'story', 'evil', 'dog', 'catchers', 'evil', 'adults', '/', 'foster', 'parents', 'not', 'so', 'bright', 'police', 'super', 'smart', 'kids.It', 'pleasant', 'film', 'made', 'better', 'love', 'dogs', 'very', 'predictible', 'cast', 'interesting', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Bernie', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'roles', 'made', 'do', 'script', 'was', 'given', 'Traitoris', 'hugely', 'better', 'film', 'Cheadle', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'sweet', 'pretty', 'smart', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'expect', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'better', 'brother', 'Bruce', 'played', 'very', 'capable', 'Jake', 'T.', 'Austin', 'Kyla', 'Pratt', 'Dr.', 'Doolite', '4', 'Tail', 'Chief', 'friend', 'group', 'probably', 'peaked', 'actress', 'horrible', 'singer', 'even', 'worse', 'strict', 'mother', 'played', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Pheobe', 'Friends', 'been', 'awful', 'time', 'also', 'series', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'movies', 'lately', 'Troy', 'Gentile', 'overweight', 'kid', 'group', 'way', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'may', 'remember', 'Tenacious', 'D', 'Nacho', 'Libre', 'Aside', 'Kudrow', 'pretty', 'decent', 'cast.Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'dogs', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'breads', 'ages', 'dog', 'here', 'everyone', 'will', 'love.Film', 'wise', 'well', 'focus', 'was', 'always', 'camera', 'movement', 'was', 'solid', 'not', 'much', 'handheld', 'garbage', 'sound', 'was', 'well', 'recorded', 'dialog', 'was', 'clear', 'editing', 'was', 'decent', 'could', 'use', 'solid', '10', 'minutes', 'removed', 'hour', '35', 'minute', 'film', 'who', 'counting', 'were', 'strange', 'CG', 'effects', 'made', 'movie', 'look', 'other', 'worldly', 'not', 'clear', 'was', 'point', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'money', 'effects', 'doves', 'flying', 'off', 'end', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'far', 'top.Rated', 'PG', 'fair', 'amount', 'poop', 'humor', 'was', '5', 'things', 'poop', 'pee', 'are', 'one', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'stepped', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'scene', 'pound', 'where', 'dog', 'taken', 'back', 'room', 'leash', 'cut', 'few', 'other', 'scenes', 'Then', 'film', 'back', 'man', 'empty', 'leash', 'reentering', 'room', 'young', 'children', 'might', 'require', 'bit', 'explaining', 'Otherwise', 'violence', 'strong', 'language', 'certainly', 'nudity', 'film', 'ages.The', 'DVD', 'chock', 'full', 'usual', 'efluvia', 'more', 'less', 'useless', 'bonus', 'features', 'fact', 'likely', 'hour', 'more', 'features.A', 'nice', 'family', 'film', 'dog', 'lovers']",N/A

Puzzling at first since how can another feel good movie with trained dogs and a couple of kids trying to rescue them be so terrible. Well, since the kids are stealing, selling ripped off items to people, disobeying parents and police as well as any adult with responsibilities and lying for most of the  movie I can see how most parents aren't going to find this movie the best role model. The kids good intentions and cute Rube Goldberg contraptions are not a justification for their methods. Additionally and unfortunately, foster homes again take another cruel hit in the movies. Having had to monitor the foster care of my students for many years I can say that 90% of those homes are a far more positive influence than the alternatives, and under challenging circumstances that only caring people can pull off.(2.)

I felt like I could really connect with the storyline as well as with ALL the cast. I have never read the book but I thought the movie was well scripted. This is definetely a movie that the entire family will enjoy especially if you are a dog lover like I am. There is no obscene gestures or language so that was a great plus. I just LOVE all of the different breeds of dogs they added into the movie.Short summary: Andi and Bruce are brother and sister being moved around from foster family to foster family. Through all of their moving around they still seem to keep their dog Friday a secret from all of their foster parents. Their new recent foster family doesn't care about anything but themselves (Kevin Dillion & Lisa Kudrow) so they decided to make their own ""family"". With the help of their newly found friends they run a secret hotel from dogs. The only problem is the dog catchers are after their dogs so they have a few run in's with them. See if Andi, Bruce, and their friends can save their dogs from the pound and save their hotel for dogs.Again this is a GREAT family movie.

If I take them to see it then maybe years from now when I'm a toothless old loon confined to a government nursing home the kids will remember this movie fondly and come around to visit me and shoo the flies off my face and maybe keep the attendents from stealing my teeth and underpants.Besides, i could teach them how to mix Milk Duds with popcorn and the flask of ""Uncle Medicine"" I carry would smooth over any bumps, especially if I mixed it with a nice fizzy Tab. Okay, kids, Hotel for Dogs it is!Well sir, I was flabbergasted. This movie was much better than it looked in trailers and commercials. In the trailers, it looked like your average , dopey, mediocre kid movie. But it's better than that. The fine folks who made this film seemed to have put some actual thought and effort into entertaining our kids.Basically, you got these two kids, bother and sister, who have been in and out of various foster homes since their parents died. They are a handful, a couple of smart little con-artists. But they are motivated by the desire to stay together and remain as much of a family as possible, and this desire extends to their dog, Friday, whom they keep hidden from a string of foster parents who won't take kids with dogs.  Most of their schemes involve ways to feed or shelter Friday, but when that becomes too daunting a task they decide to bunk him in an abandoned hotel. One thing leads to another and eventually they are taking care of not only Friday, but  a whole pack of dogs. The stray children have created a family for themselves with other strays. Of course there is a serious threat to their happiness, which(do I need to say spoiler alert) is alleviated in the end and eveyone lives happily ever after. That covers the plot.There's a lot to like about this film. The acting is good. Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon are especially funny as Lois and Carl Scudder, the stars of the Carl Scudder Experience, a low-rent rock lounge act that couldn't cut the mustard playing for a back-alley craps game much less at a venue in Vegas. They're more petty and selfish than evil, although Kudrow looks kind of like a white trash Cruella DeVil. Emma Roberts and Jake T. Austin do a good job as the kids. They're smart but not that wise-beyond -their -years smart you see in some movies. They look and act like actual kids.I should also mention the dogs. I'm generally not a fan of animals that ""act"" unless they're terrorizing the human population of a small town or island somewhere, but these dogs are often funny, even by adult standards. I think the trick is that the dog scenes are not overdone. They don't wear out their welcome for the grown-up crowd. Kids will love it. The mutts have their own little characteristics and traits but the crowd favorite was Cooper,  a big english bull dog who eats anything and everything, from license plates to ladies shoes.The movie was written by  Jeff Lowell,Robert Schooley ,& Mark McCorkle. Schooley and McCorkle created the Kim Possible series and helped write Sky High. They are developing a reputation for making quality family pictures that are fun, smart and imaginitive.The plot is simple but it's also well done. It's silly in ways that kids will enjoy but it's never insulting, pandering or overly sentimental.  And really, does a kid's movie need an intricate, detailed plot. Sure any adult who's lives in a country with free electricity is going to know how this thing turns out, but this movie really wasn't written for adults. It has humor in it that will keep an adults attention, but it's meant for th kids. A big part of the fun of seieng a movie like this with the kids is watching them watch the movie. Most of this stuff is new to them. They don't know for sure if the Hotel is doomed  when the dog catchers find out about it. They don't know if the brother and sister are going to remain a family. And they are completely surprised and tickled when the dogs perform cute and funny little stunts that dogs have performed for years. You can get a kick out of watching the suspense, surprise and joy play across their faces as the movie progresses.  It's one of those nice little films you can share with your family.",4,This Hotel is no Red Woof Inn!,1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,4782,"['So', 'brother', 'sister', 'spouses', 'are', 'taking',

Bruce and Andi are kids going through a hard time.  They hate their foster family and have taken on a huge group of dogs and are hiding them in what becomes called the ""Hotel for Dogs.""  Sounds fairly benign, I suppose.  However, the lengths these kids go to in this movie to save these dogs seems a bit much.  Breaking and entering and assault are only two of the crimes they commit (and belive me there is more done in this movie in the name of saving their ""family"") and it makes me wonder if we are making too light of what they do.  I would feel horrible if I were these children, losing their dogs like that had to be heartbreaking, however, that their combined efforts brought them to the conclusion that it is acceptable to commit crimes and become felons, well...I had a hard time with that.  As my child was watching I got to wondering what message we were sending to her regarding following the law, accepting things we truly cannot change, etc.  Yes, it's a kids movie, and kids love dogs and kids may not view it as we do, but that's what bothers me the most.  I don't know what she took away from that movie really.  What lesson did she learn? Was it that doing whatever you want to get what you want is ok? Although there were other lessons offered, such as the strength of family, I'm not sure that is what she will take away from it. The other lesson was far to exciting and and much more obvious to a child, I think. As I said in the beginning, I'm just not sure about this one, and maybe you won't be either.

Two children lose their parents and end up in dubious foster care with irresponsible adults.  They secretly acquire a dog and to avoid a dog-catcher the dog finds safety inside a dilapidated former hotel, teaming up with the two other dog residents.  The kids, and friends they meet, conspire to turn the hotel into a haven for stray dogs and this is where the movie takes an extraordinary and interesting twist.One of the children is an engineering genius.  He devises all kinds of machines to make the dogs happy and lessen the children's workload.  For example, food is automatically poured into bowls and delivered down a long dining room table to each dog.  A fire hydrant appears when a pad is pushed and afterwards, the hydrant is automatically cleaned.  The dogs experience riding in something that looks like the front seat of a car, with wind blowing at them and films of the outdoors shown on the screen, giving the illusion that they are speeding in the country.  There are way too many clever things that the ""kids"" arrange for the dogs to describe here, Suffice it to say they are ingenious and absorbing in themselves.  The dogs are filled with different personalities, and take star turns.If you are looking for upbeat family entertainment, this is a sure-fire hit.",5,"""Going to the Dogs"" gets A New Meaning",1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,1361,"['Hotel', 'Dogs', 'absolute', 'winner', 'kids', 'adults', 'who', 'love', 'dogs', 'Two', 'children', 'lose', 'parents', 'end', 'up', 'dubious', 'foster', 'care', 'irresponsible', 'adults', 'secretly', 'acquire', 'dog', 'avoid', 'dog-catcher', 'dog', 'safety', 'dilapidated', 'former', 'hotel', 'teaming', 'up', 'two', 'other', 'dog', 'residents', 'kids', 'meet', 'conspire', 'turn', 'hotel', 'haven', 'stray', 'dogs', 'where', 'movie', 'extraordinary', 'interesting', 'twist.One', 'children', 'engineering', 'genius', 'kinds', 'machines', 'make', 'dogs', 'happy', 'children', 'workload', 'example', 'food', 'automatically', 'poured', 'bowls', 'delivered', 'down', 'long', 'dining', 'room', 'table', 'dog', 'fire', 'hydrant', 'when', 'pad', 'pushed', 'afterwards', 'hydrant', 'automatically', 'cleaned', 'dogs', 'experience', 'riding', 'something', 'front', 'seat', 'car', 'wind', 'blowing', 'films', 'outdoors', 'shown', 'screen', 'giving', 'illusion', 'are', 'speeding', 'country', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'clever', 'things', 'kids', 'arrange', 'dogs', 'describe', 'here', 'Suffice', 'say', 'are', 'ingenious', 'absorbing', 'dogs', 'are', 'filled', 'different', 'personalities', 'take', 'star', 'are', 'looking', 'upbeat', 'family', 'entertainment', 'sure-fire', 'hit']",N/A

""Hotel for Dogs"" best performances are by the shorter cast members be they two or four footed.Andi (Emma Roberts) and Bruce (Jake T. Austin) are a pair of orphans living in possibly the world's worst foster home with Carl and Lois Scudder (Kevin Dillon and Lisa Kudrow). Dog food looks better than what Lois serves up for dinner and the music they play as a rock group has gone to the dogs.Andi and Bruce at first appear to be a pair of cons.  They're selling rocks in shrink wrapped cell phone packaging to unsuspecting strangers. Turns out, they're not doing this for themselves, but to keep the family together and that means feeding Friday, the long gut mutt they've been hiding from the foster parents for the past three years.When Friday ends up nearly kept by the Animal Control Officers, the sibs decide to make him a home in an abandoned hotel.  What they don't realize until they get there is that two dogs have already claimed the spot.  And well, the more the merrier as they devise a Rube Goldberg type apparatus to keep the animals fed, scooped and entertained while they are gone.Unfortunately, things go awry.
