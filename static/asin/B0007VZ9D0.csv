This film covers several different plot points: the importance of money and status versus love and family; the importance of employer/employee/customer versus corporate synergy; the importance of living for the little things in life.  I especially liked Dennis Quaid.  Quaid doesn't always get the chance to show he can actually act and this film really allowed him to shine.  A major suprise in this film was Topher Grace -- he actually can act without being the fool like he is ""That 70s Show.""

891961,A3HCZTTUH3CW9Z,B0007VZ9D0,Amy Henley,"[2, 2]","I just finished watching this movie.  At the end I was both disappointed because I wanted a happy ending tied up in a bow, but also was parodoxically glad that it didn't have the typical Hollywood ending.  I feel like this story means something because it leaves you thinking about the future of the characters and yourself.  It was an important story to tell because it is so real life.All the characters grow throughout the movie, which is unfortunately exceptionally rare in a ""big Hollywood movie.""  It is a love triangle (no, not that kind), that shows how relationships change over time.  And the characters in this movie grow, not because the characters are dysfuncional, but because change just happens. The triangle consists of Dennis Quaid's relationship as a father to Scarlett Johansson's daughter, Dennis Quaid's relationship as an employee/father figure to Topher Grace's employer/son, and Topher Grace's romantic relationship with Scarlett Johansson.  The movie follows these three characters as they make decisons about issues we all face in everyday life, such as who can we love and trust, and how much does intergrity and sincerity matter?  We make these decisions all the time, usually without thinking about how they affect us as a person, or how these decisions affect the people in our lives.  Yet, we are the sum total of these decisions.  The movie can be enjoyed on a surface level, and you may think I am digging too deep, but I think the beauty of this movie is it can make you think about these issues.  It all boils down to one question, the question each character has to ask him or her-self by the end of the movie.....what type of person do I want to be?  The movie shows that no matter your age, this question is always relevant to any decision you make.  And, no one can answer it for you.What makes this movie work is the ""synergy"" between the high quality performances, the script, and the director. The script doesn't hit you over the head with the aforementioned issues or force a perspective on you.  I thought more about them as the movie unfolded, but not in a way that took away from enjoying the movie.  The acting was great, especially Dennis Quaid and Topher Grace.  Topher's character started out as seemingly unlikable, but as the movie progresses you see past the mask.  I can think of very few actors that could have played the character as well as he did.  It really surprised me considering his previous work. I hope he is offered more scripts of this caliber. This is Dennis Quaid's best acting in a long time.  I can tell he really cared about his performance.  He perfectly blended his s**t-eating, talk the pants off 'em grin and sincerity.  Scarlett Johansson works well with both men.  They all pull great performances out of each other.  The director did a great job capturing shots that highlight the comedy and drama in the script and in the actors.  All three actors know how to emote well so you seem to feel what their characters are feeling. It goes to show how the ""synergy"" between actors, script, and director is what makes or breaks a movie, not any one person.I would recommend this movie to anyone, but especialy people who are on the brink of big changes in their lives.  It might help.  On the other hand, if you just want to watch a good movie for a couple of hours, you'll probably like this movie too.",5,"Awsome ""synergy"" between actors, script, and director",1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,3377,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'end', 'was', 'disappointed', 'wanted', 'happy', 'ending', 'tied', 'up', 'bow', 'also', 'was', 'parodoxically', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'feel', 'story', 'something', 'thinking', 'future', 'characters', 'was', 'important', 'story', 'tell', 'so', 'real', 'characters', 'grow', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'exceptionally', 'rare', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'love', 'triangle', 'not', 'kind', 'how', 'relationships', 'change', 'time', 'characters', 'movie', 'grow', 'not', 'characters', 'are', 'dysfuncional', 'change', 'just', 'triangle', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'relationship', 'father', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'daughter', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'relationship', 'employee/father', 'figure', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'employer/son', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'movie', 'three', 'characters', 'make', 'decisons', 'issues', 'face', 'everyday', 'life', 'such', 'who', 'can', 'love', 'trust', 'how', 'much', 'intergrity', 'sincerity', 'matter', 'make', 'decisions', 'time', 'usually', 'thinking', 'how', 'affect', 'person', 'how', 'decisions', 'affect', 'people', 'lives', 'are', 'sum', 'total', 'decisions', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'surface', 'level', 'may', 'think', 'am', 'digging', 'too', 'deep', 'think', 'beauty', 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'think', 'issues', 'down', 'one', 'question', 'question', 'character', 'ask', 'her-self', 'end', 'movie', '..what', 'type', 'person', 'do', 'want', 'be', 'movie', 'matter', 'age', 'question', 'always', 'relevant', 'decision', 'make', 'one', 'can', 'answer', 'you.What', 'movie', 'work', 'synergy', 'high', 'quality', 'performances', 'script', 'director', 'script', ""n't"", 'hit', 'head', 'aforementioned', 'issues', 'force', 'perspective', 'thought', 'more', 'about', 'movie', 'unfolded', 'not', 'way', 'took', 'away', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'especially', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Topher', 'character', 'started', 'out', 'seemingly', 'unlikable', 'movie', 'see', 'mask', 'can', 'think', 'very', 'few', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'really', 'surprised', 'considering', 'previous', 'work', 'hope', 'offered', 'more', 'scripts', 'caliber', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'best', 'acting', 'long', 'time', 'can', 'tell', 'really', 'cared', 'performance', 'perfectly', 'blended', 's**t-eating', 'talk', 'pants', 'grin', 'sincerity', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'well', 'men', 'pull', 'great', 'performances', 'other', 'director', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'shots', 'highlight', 'comedy', 'drama', 'script', 'actors', 'three', 'actors', 'know', 'how', 'emote', 'well', 'so', 'seem', 'feel', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'feeling', 'show', 'how', 'synergy', 'actors', 'script', 'director', 'what', 'breaks', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'person.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'especialy', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'brink', 'big', 'changes', 'lives', 'might', 'help', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'good', 'movie', 'couple', 'hours', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'movie', 'too']",N/A
891962,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B0007VZ9D0,Andrew Desmond,"[5, 5]","""In Good Company"" proved to be a pleasant way to while away a few hours on a Sunday afternoon.  The viewer is never really challenged but, rather, is taken along for a comfortable journey.In essence, the film involves a series of corporate takeovers in America where a comparatively nave young executive Carter Duryea (Topher Grace) and that's not a mis-spelling, is placed in charge of a department formerly managed by Dan Forman (Dennis Quaid).  The 26 year old apparent wunderkind has the 51 year old offsider.  Yet to further muddy the waters, Duryea falls in love with Forman's university student daughter.  Forman, needless to say, is less than impressed.In a somewhat formulaic process, the young pretender learns a few things about life the hard way.  Experience triumphs over youthful ambition.  Duryea leaves for a new, perhaps simpler, life and Forman returns to the fold back in his old job.  The young lovers go there own way.  A lesson is learned and there are no hard feelings.Would I recommend this film to others?  Well, yes, but only as a piece of escapism.  Do not expect to be challenged or made to question motives and outcomes.  See the film just for the fun of it.",4,Easy But Enjoyable Escapism,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,1187,"['Good', 'Company', 'proved', 'be', 'pleasant', 'way', 'while', 'away', 'few', 'hours', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'viewer', 'never', 'really', 'challenged', 'rather', 'taken', 'along', 'comfortable', 'journey.In', 'essence', 'film', 'series', 'corporate', 'takeovers', 'America', 'where', 'comparatively', 'nave', 'young', 'executive', 'Carter', 'Duryea', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'not', 'mis-spelling', 'placed', 'charge', 'department', 'formerly', 'managed', 'Dan', 'Forman', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', '26', 'year', 'old', 'apparent', 'wunderkind', '51', 'year', 'old', 'offsider', 'further', 'muddy', 'waters', 'Duryea', 'love', 'Forman', 'university', 'student', 'daughter', 'Forman', 'needless', 'say', 'less', 'impressed.In', 'somewhat', 'formulaic', 'process', 'young', 'pretender', 'few', 'things', 'life', 'hard', 'way', 'Experience', 'triumphs', 'youthful', 'ambition', 'Duryea', 'new', 'perhaps', 'simpler', 'life', 'Forman', 'fold', 'back', 'old', 'job', 'young', 'lovers', 'go', 'there', 'own', 'way', 'lesson', 'learned', 'are', 'hard', 'feelings.Would', 'recommend', 'film', 'others', 'Well', 'yes', 'only', 'piece', 'escapism', 'Do', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'challenged', 'made', 'question', 'motives', 'outcomes', 'See', 'film', 'just', 'fun']",N/A
891963,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0007VZ9D0,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I looked but I just couldn't find anything here I didn't like.  When I originally saw this movie in the theater I was the only one who really just adored it and so I thought that maybe I was just overreacting, that there was bound to be something I overlooked that brings this movie down a notch.  I've seen `In Good Company' about ten times not and I still have yet to find anything wrong with it.`In Good Company' is a smart comedy about reaching a crossroads in life, whether you're middle-aged or merely reaching an early peek.  Dan Foreman is 51.  He has a steady job, a good marriage and two beautiful daughters.  Then the company Dan works for gets bought out and he finds himself not only demoted, which can strike a mans masculinity in its own, but he finds himself now taking orders from a kid half his age with no experience whatsoever.  That `kid' is hotshot Carter Duryea, a 26-year-old newlywed whose life is a complete contrast to that of Dan.  Carter and his wife Kimberly are already having problems because Carter doesn't seem to know how to separate work from his personal life (personally I just love Kimberly's line ""don't try to sell me"" because it really explains the emotional level that Carter is at).  Carter has potential and he has spirit and he has drive but he lacks the maturity that Dan possesses.  Ironically (or maybe not so much) Dan lacks some of Carter's qualities and thus you have the foundation for a superb father/son/daughter/boss film about emotional growth, understanding and acceptance.Carter meets and falls for Dan's eldest daughter Alex who is just moving from home to attend college and branching off to start her own life.  The very idea of Alex moving out on her own scares Dan and so to spare her father any more anxiety she keeps her relationship with Carter a secret, but of course we know that that secret can't stay hidden forever.What helps elevate `In Good Company' are the beautifully fleshed out performances, especially from the two leads, Quaid and Grace.  Dennis Quaid is an extremely polished actor who I feel delivers knock out performance after knock out performance.  I have always enjoyed watching him act, and here he really grasps who Dan is.  What I appreciate about Dan is that he is not an overly complicated man.  He works hard, he loves his wife, he loves his children; he faces bouts of insecurity and bouts of jealousy.  He is normal, just like you and me.  Quaid understands this and plays him such.  Topher Grace is equally impressive.  I have always said that Grace was the greatest of the `That 70s Show' alumni.  Sure, Kutcher is funny but Grace is an actor, a real actor.  He can bring the funny but he can also bring heart.  As Carter he brings an air of honesty to his character.  Sure, he's quick witted and funny but he's relatable and understandable and sympathetic.  I love the scene between Carter and Alex when he's trying to convince her that they should be together and you catch him `selling' her.  It was then that I really saw Grace understood his character.The rest of the cast is just as impressive, they just don't get as much focus.  Scarlett Johansson is great as usual (seriously, I see many awards in her near future) as Alex, Carter's love interest and Dan's pride and joy.  She has so much beautiful chemistry with her co-stars.  You can see the doting daughter in her when she looks into Quaid's eyes versus the curious infatuation she has when she's talking to Grace.  She is truly a knockout actress who has everything going for her; striking beauty and immense talent.  Marg Helgenberger doesn't have much to do, but she does what she does very well, and Selma Blair is effectively detached as Kimberly.  Clark Gregg is a flawless jerk and David Paymer is sympathetic as Morty.  Philip Baker Hall also has a nice cameo (this guy really knows how to command attention).`In Good Company' is blessed to have a very good script baking up its concept and actors.  The script nicely fleshes out the relationships, both Carter and Alex's, Alex's and Dan's as well as Dan's and Carter's; each relationship adding beautiful layers to the films end result.  This film was sorely overlooked come awards time.  It has everything going for it so its snub is surprising to me.  Quaid and Grace (as well as Johansson) turn in beautifully restrained performances that exhibit an honesty rarely seen in films today.  Like I said, I can't think of a single reason to not love this movie; not one.",5,Beautifully honest look at `real' people...,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,4487,"['looked', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'When', 'originally', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'adored', 'so', 'thought', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'overreacting', 'was', 'bound', 'be', 'something', 'overlooked', 'movie', 'down', 'notch', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Good', 'Company', 'about', 'ten', 'times', 'not', 'still', 'have', 'yet', 'find', 'anything', 'wrong', 'it.', 'Good', 'Company', 'smart', 'comedy', 'reaching', 'crossroads', 'life', ""'re"", 'middle-aged', 'merely', 'reaching', 'early', 'peek', 'Dan', 'Foreman', '51', 'steady', 'job', 'good', 'marriage', 'two', 'beautiful', 'daughters', 'Then', 'company', 'Dan', 'bought', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'demoted', 'can', 'strike', 'mans', 'masculinity', 'own', 'now', 'taking', 'orders', 'kid', 'age', 'experience', 'whatsoever', 'kid', 'hotshot', 'Carter', 'Duryea', '26-year-old', 'newlywed', 'life', 'complete', 'contrast', 'Dan', 'Carter', 'wife', 'Kimberly', 'are', 'already', 'having', 'problems', 'Carter', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'separate', 'work', 'personal', 'life', 'personally', 'just', 'love', 'Kimberly', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'sell', 'really', 'emotional', 'level', 'Carter', 'Carter', 'potential', 'spirit', 'drive', 'maturity', 'Dan', 'possesses', 'Ironically', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Dan', 'Carter', 'qualities', 'thus', 'have', 'foundation', 'superb', 'father/son/daughter/boss', 'film', 'emotional', 'growth', 'understanding', 'acceptance.Carter', 'meets', 'falls', 'Dan', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Alex', 'who', 'just', 'moving', 'home', 'attend', 'college', 'branching', 'off', 'start', 'own', 'life', 'very', 'idea', 'Alex', 'moving', 'out', 'own', 'scares', 'Dan', 'so', 'spare', 'father', 'more', 'anxiety', 'relationship', 'Carter', 'secret', 'course', 'know', 'secret', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'hidden', 'forever.What', 'elevate', 'Good', 'Company', 'are', 'beautifully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'performances', 'especially', 'two', 'leads', 'Quaid', 'Grace', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'extremely', 'polished', 'actor', 'who', 'feel', 'delivers', 'knock', 'out', 'performance', 'knock', 'performance', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'act', 'here', 'really', 'grasps', 'who', 'Dan', 'What', 'appreciate', 'Dan', 'not', 'overly', 'complicated', 'man', 'hard', 'wife', 'children', 'bouts', 'insecurity', 'bouts', 'jealousy', 'normal', 'just', 'Quaid', 'such', 'Grace', 'equally', 'impressive', 'have', 'always', 'said', 'Grace', 'was', 'greatest', '70s', 'Show', 'alumni', 'Sure', 'Kutcher', 'funny', 'Grace', 'actor', 'real', 'actor', 'can', 'bring', 'funny', 'can', 'also', 'bring', 'heart', 'Carter', 'air', 'honesty', 'character', 'Sure', 'quick', 'witted', 'funny', 'relatable', 'understandable', 'sympathetic', 'love', 'scene', 'Carter', 'Alex', 'when', 'trying', 'convince', 'should', 'be', 'together', 'catch', 'selling', 'was', 'then', 'really', 'saw', 'Grace', 'understood', 'character.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'just', 'as', 'impressive', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'focus', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'great', 'usual', 'seriously', 'see', 'many', 'awards', 'near', 'future', 'Alex', 'Carter', 'love', 'interest', 'Dan', 'pride', 'joy', 'so', 'much', 'beautiful', 'chemistry', 'co-stars', 'can', 'see', 'doting', 'daughter', 'when', 'Quaid', 'eyes', 'curious', 'infatuation', 'when', 'talking', 'Grace', 'truly', 'knockout', 'actress', 'who', 'everything', 'going', 'striking', 'beauty', 'immense', 'talent', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'what', 'very', 'well', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'effectively', 'detached', 'Kimberly', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'flawless', 'jerk', 'David', 'Paymer', 'sympathetic', 'Morty', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'also', 'nice', 'cameo', 'guy', 'really', 'how', 'command', 'attention', 'Good', 'Company', 'blessed', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'script', 'baking', 'up', 'concept', 'actors', 'script', 'nicely', 'out', 'relationships', 'Carter', 'Alex', 'Alex', 'Dan', 'as', 'well', 'Dan', 'Carter', 'relationship', 'adding', 'beautiful', 'layers', 'films', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'was', 'sorely', 'overlooked', 'come', 'awards', 'time', 'everything', 'going', 'so', 'snub', 'surprising', 'Quaid', 'Grace', 'as', 'well', 'Johansson', 'turn', 'beautifully', 'restrained', 'performances', 'exhibit', 'honesty', 'rarely', 'seen', 'films', 'today', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'reason', 'not', 'love', 'movie', 'not', 'one']",N/A
891964,AYP0Z0FLR9Z0R,B0007VZ9D0,avoraciousreader,"[15, 15]","This review is partly in response to the review ""Pleasant while you're seeing it, but eminently forgettable.""  My reaction is the opposite: eminently memorable in spite of minor flaws.The film deals with a subject of recent and continuing importance (though not quite as trendy as ""outsourcing""), the reckless transactions of megacorporations and consequent downsizing as the last dollar of immediate profit is squeezed out of purchased or merged enterprises.  The related issue of displacement of older workers by young, energetic, cheaper ones also plays a part.  The film is not just an economic essay, though, and the effects of the corporate manipulations on individual lives are its focus.Dan (Dennis Quaid) is the 51 year old head of advertising sales for the magazine Sports America.  When it is bought by the GlobalCom empire (headed by flimflamming guru ""Teddy K"") whizkid Carter (Topher Grace) is brought in to take over his department, and rounds of layoffs ensue amid a drive for enhanced sales and profits.  Dan is not having the best year of his life .. in addition to demotion and uncertainty at work, his college student daughter Alex (Scarlett Johansson), always the trusted buddy, becomes withdrawn and transfers from her local school to NYU (think, big money).  His wife is unexpectedly pregnant, and between the two he must remortgage his house.  Carter also has a rough time .. he doesn't relish the harsh realities of firing people; he buys a new Porsche, and wrecks it on the way out of the dealer's lot; his wife walks out on him.  Then through several chance meetings, he finds himself able to talk openly and honestly to Alex (with that patented Johansson stare), eventually turning into a loving relationship which continues behind Dan's back.Quaid's portrayal of Dan is workmanlike and solid.  Johansson's Alex is well played and mature.  There are a number of other very nicely done supporting roles (especially non-20-somethings).  But even though I'm an old geezer who I'm sure the demographic beancounters at GlobalCom would expect to focus on Quaid's performance/character, it is Topher Grace's Carter which really makes the film work for me and sets it apart from a simple ""bad guys / good guys"" dichotomy.  The character is well written and Grace excellent in the part, as he evolves from a self-involved, clever adolescent to a feeling, adult person who realizes his actions have consequences.  Carter's almost dazed reaction to the events, good and bad, in his life is convincingly portrayed by Grace as that of a naturally withdrawn, thoughtful young man seduced by glitter and success, but having second thoughts.  However,  the backstory could have shown some of the ruthlessness (or at least disregard of others) that must have been necessary to get him the shot at this job, beyond cute tyrannosaur kiddie phones.  It's hard to believe he could have been successful in such a cutthroat outfit as GlobalCom without some hard edge, which at least on first viewing I did not detect.In contrast to the previous reviewer, this is a film that I think will stick in my mind for a long time, and which I plan to watch again soon.A couple of quibbles:-- the scene where Carter and Alex are playing tennis, rallying, and she is standing in the center of the court eating an apple while running him from side to side.

These are the elements that make up ""In Good Company""; a very bright film that explores coming of age on both sides of the fence.Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is a 51 year old who has made a career by selling ad space for ""Sports America"". He has a well established team of employees beneath him and is very much respected by his peers.Sports America has been bought out by ""Globecom"", and with the ""take over"" comes some restructuring and some ""cleaning out"".Enter 26 year old Carter Duryea (Toper Grace), a Globecom employee given the opportunity of a lifetime to work at ""Sports America""; cut their costs and increase their revenue.As Carter begins demoting and firing people, he leans to Dan for support because he is young and really has no idea what the hell he is going to do. Dan isn't impressed by the young Carter, and never fails to point out Carter's obvious flaws and lack of experience.Carter IS trying, he just has no direction. When his marriage fails and his wife bails out because she is apparently not getting any attention, Carter begins to get quite lonely; despite his financial success. He works his new team on weekends, and is pretty desperate for attention.Carter happens to weasel his way over to Dan's house one weekend evening for dinner, much to Dan's regret. During the visit, he gets a chance to talk with Dan's daughter Alex (Scarlett Johansson), who is about to start college at NYU. A future encounter on a city street starts a secret relationship ship between Carter and Alex.During this time, Carter is firing people left and right at the ordering of his Globecom superiors. Poor Dan is losing his whole team, not to mention his faith in his career. He puts up with Carter, but doesn't really extend his friendship beyond work.""In Good Company"" works on so many levels. Dennis Quaid is awesome as the fatherly and wise Dan Foreman. Toper Grace is establishing himself quite admirably as a fine young actor. He plays Carter with much more honesty than arrogance. Sure Carter is a young, inexperienced hot shot; but Grace pulls off the character so that you really do sympathize with him and his dilemma.The chemistry between Quaid and Grace is completely believable, relatable, and intriguing to watch. The supporting cast of characters are all fine actors-but the two male leads really nail their characters to perfection.For this reviewer, ""In Good Company"" refelected what I thought of as a metaphor in the lives of older vs. younger in Hollywood as well as in corporate America. It's as if you have your more mature & well established actor (Quaid), passing the torch of experience to his younger nemesis turned ally (Grace). That's just my opinion of how well these two actors played off each other. After all, Hollywood is a corporation in itself.I also thought the movie had a fine & honest ending that leaves the viewer very satisfied.  It doesn't try to end on a phony, syrupy, & sappy note; like so much other Hollywood tripe these days.Just a  fantastic film..........all the way around.",5,Enjoyable from start to finish ...,1118102400,"06 7, 2005",2005,3207,"['now', 'again', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'kind', 'respectable', 'movie', 'good', 'acting', 'well', 'written', 'dialogue', 'fine', 'direction', 'honest', 'comedy', 'drama', 'are', 'elements', 'make', 'up', 'Good', 'Company', 'very', 'bright', 'film', 'coming', 'age', 'sides', 'fence.Dan', 'Foreman', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', '51', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'selling', 'ad', 'space', 'Sports', 'America', 'well', 'established', 'team', 'employees', 'beneath', 'very', 'much', 'respected', 'peers.Sports', 'America', 'been', 'bought', 'out', 'Globecom', 'take', 'over', 'restructuring', 'cleaning', 'out', '.Enter', '26', 'year', 'old', 'Carter', 'Duryea', 'Toper', 'Grace', 'Globecom', 'employee', 'given', 'opportunity', 'lifetime', 'work', 'Sports', 'America', 'cut', 'costs', 'increase', 'revenue.As', 'Carter', 'demoting', 'firing', 'people', 'Dan', 'support', 'young', 'really', 'idea', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'do', 'Dan', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'young', 'Carter', 'never', 'point', 'out', 'Carter', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'lack', 'experience.Carter', 'IS', 'trying', 'just', 'direction', 'When', 'marriage', 'fails', 'wife', 'out', 'apparently', 'not', 'getting', 'attention', 'Carter', 'get', 'quite', 'lonely', 'financial', 'success', 'new', 'team', 'weekends', 'pretty', 'desperate', 'attention.Carter', 'happens', 'weasel', 'way', 'Dan', 'house', 'one', 'weekend', 'evening', 'dinner', 'much', 'Dan', 'regret', 'visit', 'chance', 'talk', 'Dan', 'daughter', 'Alex', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'start', 'college', 'NYU', 'future', 'encounter', 'city', 'street', 'secret', 'relationship', 'ship', 'Carter', 'Alex.During', 'time', 'Carter', 'firing', 'people', 'left', 'right', 'ordering', 'Globecom', 'superiors', 'Poor', 'Dan', 'losing', 'whole', 'team', 'not', 'mention', 'faith', 'career', 'up', 'Carter', ""n't"", 'really', 'extend', 'friendship', 'work', 'Good', 'Company', 'works', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'awesome', 'fatherly', 'wise', 'Dan', 'Foreman', 'Toper', 'Grace', 'establishing', 'quite', 'admirably', 'fine', 'young', 'actor', 'Carter', 'much', 'more', 'honesty', 'arrogance', 'Sure', 'Carter', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'hot', 'shot', 'Grace', 'character', 'really', 'do', 'sympathize', 'dilemma.The', 'chemistry', 'Quaid', 'Grace', 'completely', 'believable', 'relatable', 'intriguing', 'watch', 'supporting', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'fine', 'actors-but', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'really', 'nail', 'characters', 'perfection.For', 'reviewer', 'Good', 'Company', 'refelected', 'what', 'thought', 'metaphor', 'lives', 'older', 'vs.', 'younger', 'Hollywood', 'as', 'well', 'corporate', 'America', 'have', 'more', 'mature', 'well', 'established', 'actor', 'Quaid', 'passing', 'torch', 'experience', 'younger', 'nemesis', 'turned', 'ally', 'Grace', 'just', 'opinion', 'how', 'well', 'two', 'actors', 'played', 'off', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'corporation', 'itself.I', 'also', 'thought', 'movie', 'had', 'fine', 'honest', 'ending', 'viewer', 'very', 'satisfied', ""n't"", 'try', 'end', 'phony', 'syrupy', 'sappy', 'note', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'days.Just', 'fantastic', 'film', 'way']",N/A

A man with a perfect family (of course it's perfect, because how could we have sympathy for anyone who's not perfect?) has a mid-life crisis, emerging victorious at the end.  Kind of like Death of a Salesman without the death part.  Along the way, trite set pieces of drama arise (someone's in the hospital!  how can I pay for college!) to be overcome as well.  The script is banal, trite and Lifetime Channel movie-like.Scarlett Johannsen is strangely lifeless, as in virtually all her roles, and sucks the energy out of the film every time she appears.  Her popularity, and her seeming presence in every single movie in 2005, are perplexing at best.  I've seen props that have outacted her.  Not even Bruce-the-Shark type exciting props like in Jaws, but just stuff lying around the set.  The supporting players are ill-used, particularly Quaid's wife, who gets to say about 5 sitcom lines in the course of the movie.On top of that, the direction is strange and clunky, with bizarre camera placements and directorial decisions that veer between television-basic and outright strange.""In Good Company"" is also a stellar example of screenwriters' complete lack of familiarity with the business and corporate world outside of Hollywood and the studios.  While corporate politics abound in the real world, and layoffs happen all the time, the behaviors of some of the people at the companies in this movie are clunky and cartoonish, and bear no resemblance to the real world.So what's good about this movie?  Why three stars?  Dennis Quaid and Topher Grace.  They turn in performances that convert what could have been a trite, painful-to-watch mess into a serviceable film.  Indeed, ""In Good Company"" is a textbook example of how good actors can overcome a trite screenplay and clunky direction.  Topher Grace has always been likeable, even though I've always suspected that in That 70s Show he essentially plays himself.  However, in this film, he shows that he can turn in not just a performance, but a great one.  The same goes for Dennis Quaid.This movie is not worth going out of your way for at the video store.  Nevertheless, if it's Friday night at 10 pm and one of the only choices that remains for you is ""In Good Company"", it's worth picking up.

He does a decent acting job in most of his films, but the movies he has starred in over the years have mostly been mediocre. It seems to be a curse that Mr. Quaid cannot escape. And ""In Good Company"" is no exception. It's a very average film in terms of the storyline and the direction, with some decent performances by the leads.The story of this film centers around Quaid's character Dan Forman and his new boss, Carter Duryea, who is played by relative newcomer Topher Grace. This new kid on the block is much younger than Dan Forman and there is tension in the air from the beginning. To add to the trauma, Carter slowly develops a love interest for Forman's daughter Alex, who is played by Scarlett Johansson. This forms the basic plot of the movie.There are a few morals to this story, but they are things that we have seen and heard many times before in other movies. At one point, for example, Carter realizes that playing the role of corporate executive isn't quite the fun ride he envisioned. And Quaid's character has a crisis of sorts with accepting change- both with his daughter and with his career. This forms the basis of the movie's conflicts, and it isn't very original.Another problem I had with this movie is that there just isn't anything very memorable about it. There are no incredibly funny moments or classic lines from the characters. It's just an ordinary film about an ordinary guy who has to learn how to cope with change.In Good Company is an ok film, and it makes for a pleasant enough way to spend a rainy evening at home. I didn't find anything particularly great about this film. But I cannot say that it's bad, either.

It did have some of that in it, but mostly the movie was about the connection of a younger, naive boss taking on the older, experienced salesman. There was some hilarious moments and some really cheesy, odd ones too, but overall it had a good feel to it and was a good movie. The best part about this movie was the music - from The Shins, Damien Rice, and Iron & Wine. Unfortunately, Iron & Wine is the only bad that appears on the soundtrack to the movie. Bad mistake!On a side note, this movie does not have a cliche Hollywood ending, but rather a more realistic approach to a very possible situation. Some people may not like the ending because of that, but I applaud the creators of this film for doing what they did. Wandering outside the box is something more movies should do these days. I would compare this movie to Garden State, and while Garden State may have seemingly followed the Hollywood guidelines more than this film did, I just think it was more appropriate in that film, because of the depth of the connection between Zach Braff and Natalie Portman.

In Good Company, a film that I was expecting to be lighter and more of a romantic comedy, takes a look inside a company that is not unlike many of the corporations that many of us work for, where the bottom line is more important than the livelihood of the employees.Dennis Quaid plays Dan Foreman, a 51-year-old head of advertising at a company called Sports America, which publishes a very popular magazine that in an alternate universe we might assume is illustrated. Dan has a great relationship with his employees, mainly because he never makes them feel threatened, and prefers to treat them as equals. However, when a global corporation called WorldCom takes over Sports America, a young hotshot named Carter Duryea (Topher Grace) is brought in to take over Dan's job. Dan's wife Ann (Marg Helgenberger) helpfully observes that Carter looks to be about half Dan's age, and she's about right.Carter's been assigned the task of increasing ad sales for the magazine. Dan is pretty sure that that is impossible, since sales have been steady for a long time, but Carter's got a buzz word, passed down from the top: synergy. His strategy is to intermingle with WorldCom's other subsidiaries and cross-promote. When this strategy isn't working, and costs need to be cut, heads start rolling, and Dan fears for his job. Meanwhile, Carter has met Dan's daughter Alex (Scarlett Johansson), a student at NYU. What they have in common is a struggle to have an identity. Carter's a successful businessman and Alex is a successful tennis player, but neither seems to have much passion for their gifts. Carter, as Dan's boss, of course cannot allow Dan to know about his relationship with Alex, but we all know that secrets like that never get kept for very long.Like I said before, this wasn't exactly the film I was expecting, and it was a little surprising to me, in both good and bad ways. The good was that it was more intelligent in showing corporate politics at work than most films are able to achieve. There is nothing contrived about the way the company works: people really do get fired when there is a lot of money on the line, and a larger corporation doesn't even know its employees, let alone care much about what happens to them after they're not making money for the company anymore.However, In Good Company lacks the cynical bite necessary to really tear apart big business. This is a comedy, but there are only a handful of truly funny moments; there are a lot that will cause the audience to smirk, but guffaws are few and far between. The performances are generally good, with Dennis Quaid doing stellar work as always, and Topher Grace is surprisingly effective in a semi-dramatic role. The only disappointment is Scarlett Johansson, who isn't given much to work with, and doesn't do anything great with the material. This isn't a bad little film, but it's not much more than occasional entertainment, and that's unforunate, because it really had potential.",3,"Not exactly what I expected, but still somewhat enjoyable",1116288000,"05 17, 2005",2005,3149,"['Corporations', 'America', 'are', 'growing', 'ever', 'stronger', 'conversely', 'individuals', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'workforce', 'corporations', 'are', 'losing', 'identities', 'growing', 'weaker', 'Good', 'Company', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'lighter', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'look', 'company', 'not', 'many', 'corporations', 'many', 'work', 'where', 'bottom', 'line', 'more', 'important', 'livelihood', 'employees.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Dan', 'Foreman', '51-year-old', 'head', 'advertising', 'company', 'called', 'Sports', 'America', 'very', 'popular', 'magazine', 'alternate', 'universe', 'might', 'assume', 'illustrated', 'Dan', 'great', 'relationship', 'employees', 'mainly', 'never', 'feel', 'threatened', 'prefers', 'treat', 'equals', 'However', 'when', 'global', 'corporation', 'called', 'WorldCom', 'over', 'Sports', 'America', 'young', 'hotshot', 'named', 'Carter', 'Duryea', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'brought', 'take', 'over', 'Dan', 'job', 'Dan', 'wife', 'Ann', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'helpfully', 'Carter', 'be', 'Dan', 'age', 'right.Carter', 'been', 'assigned', 'task', 'increasing', 'ad', 'sales', 'magazine', 'Dan', 'pretty', 'sure', 'impossible', 'sales', 'have', 'been', 'steady', 'long', 'time', 'Carter', 'got', 'buzz', 'word', 'passed', 'down', 'top', 'synergy', 'strategy', 'intermingle', 'WorldCom', 'other', 'subsidiaries', 'cross-promote', 'When', 'strategy', ""n't"", 'working', 'costs', 'need', 'be', 'cut', 'heads', 'start', 'rolling', 'Dan', 'fears', 'job', 'Meanwhile', 'Carter', 'met', 'Dan', 'daughter', 'Alex', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'student', 'NYU', 'What', 'have', 'common', 'struggle', 'have', 'identity', 'Carter', 'successful', 'businessman', 'Alex', 'successful', 'tennis', 'player', 'neither', 'have', 'much', 'passion', 'gifts', 'Carter', 'Dan', 'boss', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'allow', 'Dan', 'know', 'relationship', 'Alex', 'know', 'secrets', 'never', 'get', 'kept', 'very', 'long.Like', 'said', 'before', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', 'little', 'surprising', 'good', 'bad', 'ways', 'good', 'was', 'was', 'more', 'intelligent', 'showing', 'corporate', 'politics', 'work', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'able', 'achieve', 'nothing', 'contrived', 'way', 'company', 'people', 'really', 'do', 'get', 'fired', 'when', 'lot', 'money', 'line', 'larger', 'corporation', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'employees', 'let', 'alone', 'care', 'much', 'what', ""'re"", 'not', 'making', 'money', 'company', 'anymore.However', 'Good', 'Company', 'cynical', 'bite', 'necessary', 'really', 'tear', 'apart', 'big', 'business', 'comedy', 'are', 'only', 'handful', 'truly', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'lot', 'will', 'cause', 'audience', 'smirk', 'guffaws', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'performances', 'are', 'generally', 'good', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'doing', 'stellar', 'work', 'always', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'semi-dramatic', 'role', 'only', 'disappointment', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'work', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'great', 'material', ""n't"", 'bad', 'little', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'occasional', 'entertainment', 'unforunate', 'really', 'had', 'potential']",N/A

The movie is more about a middle-aged man and a father-to-be (Dennis Quaid). He was handling a job crisis (his company was just taken over), a financial crisis (his baby coming and his eldest girl transferred to NYU), middle-age crisis (his new boss was young enough to be his son and the ""old and traditional"" people could not compete with the ""young and inspiring"")  as well as an emotional crisis (daddy girl has grown up and moved out). To make it more difficult, he has always treated his co-workers as a family and now he had to fire some of them as a consequence of synergy. All he could hang on to was his family. However, even as he has always treasured his closeness with his eldest daughter and expected her to keep no secrets from him, things were not the same anymore.When things didn't come at all as expected, at work or at home, he had to juggle between upholding his principles or making compromises. Actually he did a bit of both. I must say I am most impressed by Dennis Quaid. He played the role well and the struggles he has to face are so real.Having said that, the romantic part of the movie is still well presented. Especially well-played is Topher Grace, the 26-year old ambitious young man who, inspired by Dennis Quaid, ultimately embarked on a new course heading one step closer towards his dream.I like the movie because the ending is not so Hollywood and  the theme in the movie is consistent- that people are most important and the most valuable asset, both in a family and in a company; that people can still be upright and successful; and people, regardless of their age, can still hope for a better future.",4,A warm movie,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,1788,"['thought', 'would', 'be', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'whom', 'really', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'more', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'father-to-be', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'was', 'handling', 'job', 'crisis', 'company', 'was', 'just', 'taken', 'over', 'financial', 'crisis', 'baby', 'coming', 'eldest', 'girl', 'transferred', 'NYU', 'middle-age', 'crisis', 'new', 'boss', 'was', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'son', 'old', 'traditional', 'people', 'could', 'not', 'compete', 'young', 'inspiring', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'crisis', 'daddy', 'girl', 'grown', 'up', 'moved', 'out', 'make', 'more', 'difficult', 'always', 'treated', 'co-workers', 'family', 'now', 'had', 'fire', 'consequence', 'synergy', 'could', 'hang', 'was', 'family', 'However', 'even', 'always', 'treasured', 'closeness', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'expected', 'keep', 'secrets', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'same', 'anymore.When', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'expected', 'work', 'home', 'had', 'juggle', 'upholding', 'principles', 'making', 'compromises', 'Actually', 'did', 'bit', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'most', 'impressed', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'played', 'role', 'well', 'struggles', 'face', 'are', 'so', 'real.Having', 'said', 'romantic', 'part', 'movie', 'still', 'well', 'presented', 'Especially', 'well-played', 'Topher', 'Grace', '26-year', 'old', 'ambitious', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'inspired', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'ultimately', 'embarked', 'new', 'course', 'heading', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'dream.I', 'movie', 'ending', 'not', 'so', 'Hollywood', 'theme', 'movie', 'consistent-', 'people', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'most', 'valuable', 'asset', 'family', 'company', 'people', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'upright', 'successful', 'people', 'regardless', 'age', 'can', 'still', 'hope', 'better', 'future']",N/A

I really have had no respect for the business world since the creation of the ""Yuppie"". I feel that once the ""Yuppie"" was created that pretty much destroyed part of our work ethic. What I mean is the loyal part of the workplace. I see people float around from one workplace to another after a short time. I feel that when the ""Yuppie"" was created that the days of the long-term relationships with employer and employee were severed, and therefore no chance of making friends with those we work with, and work became less-appealling. I feel that's what happened in this movie as I would see people getting jerked around not knowing whether they will have a job tomorrow, or not, and bowing to a corporate raider like he/she's God. Having to sell out all your values for cold hard cash, and flaunt it in front of everybody. Well this movie did that, but it also showed a person can change when he/she wants to. With the supporting character of Carter he plays opposite Dennis Quaid as Quaid's boss, and he climbed up the corporate ladder rather fast as he's only 26. He would get married, and then divorced in short order, and then he rebounds with Quaid's oldest daughter, and then loses her. Quaid in the meantime has done the job shuffle all throughout the movie. I see this as the workplace out of balance where those who are at the top make out all right, and those in the middle like Quaid and Carter take a risk of getting fired, or laid off. I see this as a movie that makes me not want to go to work, but do like Carter does at the end of the movie, and that's jogging on the beach; not sure whether he has a job, or not, but at least he's happy. I look back, and see that the conception of the ""Yuppie"" was done in 1981 when Reagan fired all the air traffic controllers at Eastern Airlines when they went on strike. This destroyed the union as a whole as it became easier for corporations to thrwart strikes, and keeping unions in check, and keeping workers uncertain about thier futures. I just hate the plots like this, but this was done rather well with the performances of Quaid, Scarrlett Johannsen as Quaid's eldest daughter, and Carter.

891981,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0007VZ9D0,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","In Good Company is a well-made, entertaining film that reveals the soullessness of our modern ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" society.  Companies are bought and sold like common chattel, dedicated workers are sacrificed to the cash cow of corporatism, business leaders make hundreds of millions of dollars by uttering meaningless catch phrases and big words while proving themselves quite oblivious to the concept of actually serving their customers (or their employees), and the depersonalization of the business world leads to corporate scandals and broken lives.  In this film, the old school meets the new school; it's not always pretty, but it is entertaining - and educational.Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) has it pretty good; he's got a great wife and two teenaged daughters, he makes a good living doing something he enjoys - overseeing the ad sales for Sports America magazine, and he's happy in his quiet, stable life.  Then, change crashes down upon him in wave upon wave.  He learns that his wife is pregnant (which is the last thing he expected at their age), Sports America is sold to a big conglomerate, he's replaced by some college kid know-it-all, and his eldest daughter wants to transfer to NYU (second mortgage, here we come).  At least he does get to keep his job - he's just reporting to young Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), who has zero years experience compared to his twenty-three years in the position he just lost.  As he watches long-time clients disappear and good employees that he hired lose their jobs, he thinks things can't get much worse - and then he finds out that his daughter is sleeping with his young boss.  One can understand why he gets a little grumpy at times.Carter is an interesting character, and I must say Topher Grace acquits himself quite well in the role.  Initially, he is just annoyingly gung ho about business and his bright and shiny future - in a word, he is one of the mindless zombies inspired by business moguls such as Teddy K (Malcolm McDowell).  It's synergy this, synergy that, teamwork, blah blah blah - we've all heard that new brand of corporate nonsense.  It would be easy to dislike such a character (and Dan certainly does dislike him - at first).  We examine Carter's life in juxtaposition to that of Dan, though, and we see the human being behind the suit.  His wife has left him after seven months, and he's so lonely that he boondoggles Dan into inviting him home for dinner.  There he renews an earlier brief acquaintance with Dan's daughter Alex (Scarlett Johansson), and that lays the foundation for their blooming relationship - which is kept hush hush from Dan, of course.  Dads have a way of finding out their daughters' little secrets, though.It is most interesting to watch the relationship between Dan and Carter develop as the film proceeds.  You may not be able to teach an old dog new tricks, but that doesn't mean that old dog doesn't have a few things to teach the pups, and Carter begins to understand that - just as he begins to see his fellow suits in a new light after Teddy K himself pays the company a visit.  As for Dan, he comes to see the deficiencies in Carter's life, and a weird kind of father-son relationship eventually emerges as Carter begins to change.  The ending is somewhat ambiguous, but so is life itself.This is a very human film on all counts.  It has its funny moments, but I would not really consider this a comedy in the traditional sense.  It's a story about life, an intelligent film that proceeds with a sense of honesty and believability that is rare in movies these days.

It's a film of deep humanity and equally deep characterization.  Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is an old-style ad executive who seals a deal with a firm handshake and Laker tickets.  Carter Duryea(Topher Grace) is an ambitious salesman who has his eye on the company's bottom line but is oblivious to the people around him.  When Carter, half Dan's age, becomes his boss through a multinational takeover of Dan's magazine you would think there would be unbearable tension.  The result instead is an uneasiness.  A lesser film would villify Carter.  Instead he is portrayed as something of a scared rabbit forced into the role of company hatchetman.  Credit director-writer Paul Weitz(""About a Boy"") for crafting a film inhabited by complex human beings.  There's not enough you can say about Quaid other than he has aged like fine wine, though Dan in all likelihood is a beer man.  Quaid just has that winning charm about him that makes for a compelling screen presence.  Grace masterfully portrays the complexities of Carter.  Together with Quaid there is a great rapport between these two actors.  The one discernible flaw in the film is a contrived romance between Carter and Dan's daughter, Alex(Scarlett Johannson).  This was probably the selling point of the film since Grace and Johannson are up-and-coming actors but it only detracts from the main story line.",4,The Rare Comedy for Adults,1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,1455,"['Lost', 'high', 'concept', 'holiday', 'films', 'Oscar', 'contenders', 'came', 'gem', 'movie', 'film', 'deep', 'humanity', 'equally', 'deep', 'characterization', 'Dan', 'Foreman', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'old-style', 'ad', 'executive', 'who', 'deal', 'firm', 'handshake', 'Laker', 'tickets', 'Carter', 'Duryea', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'ambitious', 'salesman', 'who', 'eye', 'company', 'bottom', 'line', 'oblivious', 'people', 'When', 'Carter', 'half', 'Dan', 'age', 'boss', 'multinational', 'takeover', 'Dan', 'magazine', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'unbearable', 'tension', 'result', 'instead', 'uneasiness', 'lesser', 'film', 'would', 'villify', 'Carter', 'Instead', 'portrayed', 'something', 'scared', 'rabbit', 'forced', 'role', 'company', 'hatchetman', 'Credit', 'director-writer', 'Paul', 'Weitz', 'Boy', 'crafting', 'film', 'inhabited', 'complex', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'enough', 'can', 'say', 'Quaid', 'other', 'aged', 'fine', 'wine', 'Dan', 'likelihood', 'beer', 'man', 'Quaid', 'just', 'winning', 'charm', 'compelling', 'screen', 'presence', 'Grace', 'masterfully', 'complexities', 'Carter', 'Together', 'Quaid', 'great', 'rapport', 'two', 'actors', 'one', 'discernible', 'flaw', 'film', 'contrived', 'romance', 'Carter', 'Dan', 'daughter', 'Alex', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'was', 'probably', 'selling', 'point', 'film', 'Grace', 'Johannson', 'are', 'up-and-coming', 'actors', 'only', 'main', 'story', 'line']",N/A

Unlike other recent films/shows that poke fun at corporate life such as Office Space or The Office, In Good Company never really seems willing to take off the gloves or throw its haymaker. Yes--there is a little ribbing on use of buzz words and concepts, such as ""synergy,"" and the one corporate kiss-up who gets his just desserts in the end, but In Good Company is too interested in its human tale to ever really stick it to the suits like we all know they deserve.And then, in the romantic angle, again In Good Company feels a little milquetoast, strange to say. The romance which drives the plot from mid-way to the end doesn't ever feel compelling; it tugs no heartstrings, and the ending is weak and unsatisfying on this score, too.The best thing about the film has to be how it presents both Dennis Quaid's and Topher Grace's characters sympathetically and as real people. We understand them both, and their conflicts, and root for them both throughout. There are a lot of movies that unfairly only show one side of a conflict, and In Good Company keeps clear of that failing.In the end, an enjoyable movie to watch, and good for a date in an established, comfortable relationship (find something more romantic for the first or second dates, if possible).

One thing though, I really didn't consider this a comedy.  It didn't have the laugh out loud funny moments that you would expect in a comedy and the funny moments seemed forced and placed in the film only to give it a comedic edge (a car getting wrecked, an accident during a basketball game).  There is really something un-funny about a man threatened with losing his job when his family needs him the most, and to see his co-workers lose their jobs.  The Topher Grace character was really great in this film as young ""Carter,"" a hotshot marketing guy who finds himself thrust into ad sales.  The relationship between Dan (Dennis Quaid) and Carter's daughter also suprised me.  I was under the impression before I saw the film that Carter was going to be his new boss and then he was going to find out that she was dating his daughter.  Not so, he meets the daughter for a second time at Dan's house.  I didn't think the relationship between Alex (Scarlet Johanson) and Carter was well developed.  It was like they chilled one time and then were on the fast track.  At the beginning of their relationship (which received very little screen time), she seems to have no concerns or regards for getting intimate with her fathers boss.  At times I was wondering if she was getting close to him to help save her fathers job.  Another thing about her character I found was odd, it seemed to me that her voice changed during the movie.  In the beginning when she was in full tom boy mode her voice had much more base than when she let her hair down and started attending college in the city.  Overall, it is an entertaining movie, nothing I would want to watch again, but it was interesting although a bit predictable at times.

891985,AC9B29BXXWJHD,B0007VZ9D0,Ellis Bell,"[1, 3]","This movie was not what I expected. 51-year-old office worker Dan Forman (Dennis Quaid) finds himself demoted- with a 26-year-old boss Carter (Topher Grace). With a wife (Marge Helgenberger), two daughters, and a child on the way, Forman and his wife Anne take out a second mortgage on their home so that their eldest daughter Alex (Scarlet Johanssen) can attend NYU as a transfer student. In the meantime, Carter finds himself divorced from his wife of seven months (Selma Blair). While in New York, Alex finds herself dating Carter, which makes her dad none too pleased. Carter and Dan find themselves locking heads several times throughout the movie, without any definite result.As I have said before this movie is not what I expected; I thought I was going to be seeing a comedy and eneded up seeing something that was decidedly depressing in content. However, there are a few comic lines. For example, when Carter goes over to the Forman house for dinner. Anne drops a container of baked ziti, forcing the family to order take-out pizza instead. Carter, never having eaten family-style dinners before, asks Anne where she got the pizza, and Anne says, ""Its from a lovely little Italian restaurant called Dominoes."" Boynd that, the movie is made up of mostly awkward silences between various characters.While this movie had a few redeeming qualities, I'm not sure that I'm a big fan of Topher Grace or Scarlett Johanssen as actors. Topher Grace is a ""jumpy"" actor, and for the most part inconsistent. However, Grace and Quaid have a good rapport onscreen, and the movie does tackle some current issues such as employee layoff wuite well.

891989,ANYDF6GKK7PA4,B0007VZ9D0,"Jackson Zhou ""The Craftsman""","[1, 1]","""In Good Company"" has a lot of good things to offer: For one thing, it's got a wonderful and unpretentious script that somehow made it through the cynical and cash-mongering boardroom of Hollywood.  Its ideas are simple, that despite a dog-eat-dog world of unhumanistic corporations and high-minded soundbites, in the end what matter the most are the things that makes us all human --- family, friendships, love, and respect for one another.The cast is a diverse range of actors/actresses that generated good on-screen chemistry.  Of worthy mention is Dennis Quaid, who plays a man who is facing a mid life/career crisis.  Quaid must deal with serious challenges on both the work and home front--- a corporate restructuring that leads to downsizing which could mean his demise at the company where he's worked for the last 25 years; a college daughter who seeks indepedence from his overly protective father; and the prospect of becoming father once again in his 50's with a new baby on the way.  What makes things even more complicated is the demoralizing predicament of demoting himself to serve a subordinate role to Topher Grace, who plays Quaid's boss in the wake of the corporate takeover, and who happens to be half of Quaid's age.  And to make things even more interesting, there's soon a budding romance between Grace and Quaid's daughter, played by Scarlett Johannson.If all that seems overwhelming for you the audience, then it is just as daunting for Quaid's Dan Foreman.  However, in my opinion, the story is only secondary in this movie.  It provides a intricate tableau where the characters' reveal themselves in colorful ways. Quaid's Foreman shines through with unwavering dignity and sentimentality.  His genuine care for the people around him and willingness to stand by what he believes is admirable to the point of being painful.  Both Grace and Johannson's characters grow through love, loss and disillusions.  In the end, this film is a successful situational drama that connects people who are facing differents sets of dilemmas at different stages of their life with the common challenges that they all face.The film is not without some shortcomings:  For one, Quaid risks being overly melodramatic at times.

The highpoint for me came at the moment where at the prospect of offending the chairman of the corporation and losing his job, he speaks out about his doubt of high-minded business ideas like ""synergy"", and the truth of a company that should owe responsibility to its employees.

This movie nails that expectation right on the head.This is the story of Dave Foreman (Dennis Quaid) who is the manager of the sales team at the number one sports magazine in the nation.  When the magazine gets sold, David is replaced by a young hot-shot who is half his age named Carter Duryea (Topher Grace).  But wait, there is more!!!But I would recommend catching movie and following the story on your own.  All I can promise is that the story is fantastic and totally keeps you involved.The best part of this movie is the acting.  Every character is done perfectly.  I could not expect a better performance by anybody in this movie.  I have only known Topher Grace from the few episodes I've seen of ""That 70's Show"".  I was totally impressed and could not believe that it was him I was watching.  You see his highs (like finding out he is being courted or picking out his brand new car) and his lows (as he gets divorced, gets dumped, gets punched in the face, has to fire people twice his age, and wrecks said sports car).  I expect great things to come from him in the future.Dennis Quaid is fantastic as always. He also carried a wide emotional range as he faces being replaced by a young kid, finding out his wife is pregnant, dealing with issues with his daughters, and having to fire two of his friends.Also what makes this movie great is that it doesn't have a completely happy ending.  You see the potential in the future of everybody's lives involved, but that is left to your imagination.  And that makes this movie, to me, real.  Life is like that.  Heck, who does live happily ever after with no more problems in life?  My wife was a bit disappointed by the ending, I loved it!If you like movies described as I did in the first paragraph, check this movie out.

Topher Grace plays the new boss, and he's terrific as an obnoxious but charming kid on a power trip. Quaid and Grace's awkward, amusing, and (eventually) fond friendship is the crux of the film, and the best reason to see it. The movie's flaws: First, it's slow at times, I expected more inter-office interaction. Second, for a film about cold corporations and job insecurity, the comedy is less sharp than it could be. It's almost as if the movie is too light for its subject. Characters get laid off but you never see how it would hurt their families. The only really bad thing that happens to anyone is that they have to take out a second mortgage! Another reason the comedy is so lightweight is that there no major bad guys to make fun of. Quaid and Grace (who lays off Quaid's colleagues) represent different business philosophies, but they're both essentially good-hearted.

891992,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0007VZ9D0,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[23, 24]","""In Good Company"" is definitely good comedy and makes for terrific entertainment! Contemporary big business practices are satirized here Big Time! Written and directed by Paul Weitz, this is a film with a fluid storyline interwoven with some poignant threads about how we set our priorities and choose to live our lives. Not corny or too sentimental, the top-notch cast and good acting only increase the viewers' pleasure. Dennis Quaid is fabulous here, as is Topher Grace, his young nemesis. What more could one desire in a movie for a fun evening - except some hot popcorn?Dan Foreman, (Dennis Quaid), is the successful Director of Marketing for Sports America Magazine. He actually likes his work, which is good, since he is a twenty-five year veteran of the ad industry. Dan is a fifty-something family man, married to forty-ish Anne Foreman, (stunning Marg Helgenberger from TV's CSI),  who, we learn early on, is pregnant - a pre-menopausal surprise! It's OK, they're thrilled about the upcoming event! Daughter Alex, (Scarlett Johansson), an eighteen year-old college student, and her slightly younger sister Jana, (Zena Gray), really make-up the kind of warm, loving family anyone would want to belong to. These are decent, intelligent, normal people, who all seem to possess a sense of humor - some quirkier than others.Carter Duryea, (Topher Grace), is a 26 year-old marketing wiz for GlobeCom, a multinational corporate conglomerate, owned and run by a Rupert Murdoch-like figure, ""Teddy K,"" (Malcolm McDowell). Carter has frequently impressed his colleagues and managers with his creativity. His latest success, a cell phone ad campaign which targets preschoolers with dinosaur multi-colored mini phones, that roar instead of ring, has put smiles on GlobeCom employees' faces. Carter is driven, smart, smug and filled with energy fueled by lots of caffeine. He chugs down cup after cup of Starbucks' best. His marriage to a shallow, spoiled, deb type is definitely on the wane. Maybe he should spend more time at home, less at work. But then he wouldn't be GlobeCom's golden boy.When GlobeCom acquires Sports America Magazine, young Turk Carter Duryea is promoted to head of ad sales. Guess whose position he usurps? At least Dan still has a job - as Carter's assistant - his ""wing man!"" Carter moves into Dan's corner office. Believe it or not, there are worse nightmares. Corporate acquisitions and mergers frequently trigger downsizing and lay-offs. Dan's entire sales team and many other Sports America employees are fired. Meanwhile, Dan's emotions run the gamut from rage to disbelief. And Carter doesn't know too much about magazine sales. He does talk a lot about ""synergy,"" however - a popular buzz word around GlobeCom. In a rousing speech to his new ""team,"" he asks them if they are ""psyched for an awesome quarter."" Although nobody seems to understand what this all means, they are eager to suck-up to the new boss, so they nod their heads in agreement.""Synergy"" we are informed by Teddy K., ""means the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The relationship which the parts have to each other is a part in and of itself - the most empowering, unifying and exciting part."" Carter comes to learn what Dan knows from Day 1 - ""synergy"" does not sell ads!Weitz has structured his film in such a way that as we observe the parallel lives of Foreman and Duryea, we do not villanize the aggressive, yuppie brat. In fact, the further we move into the story, the more sympathetic both Carter and Dan become as characters. Dan may be depressed, humiliated and frustrated about his demotion, but trust me when I say that Carter's life is not the proverbial ""bowl of cherries!"" The juxtaposition of scenes contrasting the two men's worlds is truly effective. In one instance Dan signs papers taking out a second mortgage to pay for Alex's transfer to NYU, plus the expenses a new baby will incur - while Carter signs his divorce papers and buys a top-of-the-line Porsche. Dan's contented family life, along with his temporary financial difficulties are far removed from the financially secure but very lonely and isolated situation young Carter experiences.Dan invites Carter to dinner after a long business meeting - not through hospitality, but by accident. He never expects Carter to accept. Carter and Dan's daughter Alex click, subtly enough that both parents are unaware. Carter finds in Alex a person he can talk to with honestly, without pretension. Alex experiences similar feelings. The situation really becomes weird when the two begin a relationship, while, at the same time, Dan and Carter's relationship improves - in many ways resembling a father-son situation, even when things turn violent. The dynamic between the two businessmen continually shifts, as do those between Alex and her father, Alex and Carter, Dan and Anne, etc.. There are enough wily twists and turns in the plot to keep things lively throughout. Nothing sappy or contrived here!This is an intelligent film well worth watching. I recommend it highly.JANA",4,"An Intelligent, Entertaining Comedy - Well Worth Watching!",1122681600,"07 30, 2005",2005,5055,"['Good', 'Company', 'definitely', 'good', 'comedy', 'terrific',

If not that, then the movie is an obvious homage to something so outlandish that it's not to be taken realistically.  In Good Company, however, takes the opposite approach, showing genuine familial, work, and romantic relationships.  With nearly no twists or surprises, almost no exaggeration whatsoever, this movie delivers as intended.Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is the director of marketing for a company being purchased by a multination conglomerate.  Corporate restructuring brings about the obvious changes.  As a result, most of Dan's team is fired, and his position is usurped by Carter Duryea (Topher Grace) - as the young, brash, conceited yet overmatched, buzz-word spouting whiz-kid - making Dan the second fiddle.  Just like a formulaic black-white movie, where the white character inevitably learns to dance from the black character, Carter soon learns from the wiser, experienced, and worldly sage of marketing.  Just think of Dan as Miyagi and Carter as Daniel-San; it only takes one good butt-kicking, literally in this movie, to realize how incompetent and unprepared you are when faced with an experienced adversary.When Carter meets Dan's georgous, college-bound daughter Alex (Scarlett Johansson), sparks fly, adding yet another juxtaposed subplot amidst the struggles of life, love, and corporate advancement.Overall it's a decent, albeit predictable, somewhat bland movie that if nothing more, provides a reason to ogle Johansson and see Quaid turn in a great performance.",3,Morality lessons in a feel good movie,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,1605,"['Today', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'movie', 'humanity', 'negativity', 'inevitable', 'dystopian', 'future', 'not', 'then', 'movie', 'obvious', 'homage', 'something', 'so', 'outlandish', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'realistically', 'Good', 'Company', 'however', 'opposite', 'approach', 'showing', 'genuine', 'familial', 'work', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'nearly', 'twists', 'surprises', 'almost', 'exaggeration', 'whatsoever', 'movie', 'intended.Dan', 'Foreman', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'director', 'marketing', 'company', 'being', 'purchased', 'multination', 'conglomerate', 'Corporate', 'restructuring', 'obvious', 'changes', 'result', 'most', 'Dan', 'team', 'fired', 'position', 'usurped', 'Carter', 'Duryea', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'young', 'brash', 'conceited', 'yet', 'overmatched', 'buzz-word', 'spouting', 'whiz-kid', 'making', 'Dan', 'second', 'fiddle', 'Just', 'formulaic', 'black-white', 'movie', 'where', 'white', 'character', 'inevitably', 'dance', 'black', 'character', 'Carter', 'soon', 'wiser', 'experienced', 'worldly', 'sage', 'marketing', 'Just', 'think', 'Dan', 'Miyagi', 'Carter', 'Daniel-San', 'only', 'one', 'good', 'butt-kicking', 'literally', 'movie', 'realize', 'how', 'incompetent', 'unprepared', 'are', 'when', 'faced', 'experienced', 'adversary.When', 'Carter', 'Dan', 'georgous', 'college-bound', 'daughter', 'Alex', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'fly', 'adding', 'yet', 'juxtaposed', 'subplot', 'struggles', 'life', 'love', 'corporate', 'advancement.Overall', 'decent', 'predictable', 'somewhat', 'bland', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'reason', 'ogle', 'Johansson', 'see', 'Quaid', 'turn', 'great', 'performance']",N/A

Based on the apparent target demographic for this film, it was marketed horribly.  The trite title and kitchy manner in which the preview clips were edited reminded me too much of those shallow adoloescent throwaway Disney films - the type hollywood routinely pukes out for 14 year old girls.  And knowing Dennis Quaid's penchant for appearing in such films, I assumed In Good Company was another one of those.Recently however, I stumbled across the movie's opening credits on HBO.  ""I'll stay long enough to make fun of it."", I thought to myself.  But in a matter of minutes, I was completely sucked in.  The writing was intelligent and the tone often dark.  This is a movie that, on the surface appears to be a natural born comedy, yet it resists the obvious cornball pitfalls at every turn.The characters are not 1 dimesnional buffoons, but are written to be very believable people with real problems.  Every time I smelled a cliche or overly sentimental twist coming, the film continued to surprise me by not taking the easy way out.Is it a perfect film?

It is not cynical. It is not maudlin. It has a well crafted story which is complimented by expert film making and some truly great acting. Once in a while the scenes in the office environment ring a bit hollow, especially the forced young versus old plot thread that permeates those moments. But outside of the office this film truely shines. Don't get me wrong, the office scenes are fine but they really do pale when compared to the scenes that show Topher Grace's character to be so alone even though he has everything a young professional could ask for. Dennis Quaid turns in a bravura performance as the older of the two colleagues a man concerned that his family is growing up and away too quickly and that the work world he once controlled so adeptly has been snatched away from him by a corporate takeover that brings in a squad of shallow cold blooded young turks. I believe that this film will be remembered as the launching board for Grace's career and a shot of adreniline for Quaid's. In that sense it mirrors the plot of the film and the fact that a rising young star does not always outshine the steady glow of the mature and experienced professional. But quite often it helps to illuminate the qualities of the previous generation that time has conspired to overlook.

892006,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B0007VZ9D0,kaduzy,"[3, 4]","This film was a lot better than I expected, but I'll be the first to admit that my expectations were pretty low.  It's funnier than I anticipated, and the story is pretty good too.  Dennis Quaid is a man in his 50s who's been in charge of the advertising department of a sports magazine for decades, and is abruptly replaced in a game of corporate shuffle with a kid a little over half his age, played by Topher Grace.  Suddenly he has a cocky new boss, and to add insult to injury, his boss begins dating his college-aged daughter (Scarlett Johansson).The warm beating heart of this movie is undoubtedly Topher Grace.  I'm not a big TV person, so I am unfamiliar with his work on ""That 70's Show"" but I kept hearing so many good things about him that I was especially eager to see if he measured up to the elaborate praise.  (He is considered by many to be ""the next Tom Hanks"".)  Well . . . he does.  He has great comic timing, he has excellent command of his role and his character, and he's utterly charming.  Well, anyway his *character* was charming.  :-)  I don't know anything about him in real life!  But his acting is what matters, and in that respect, he definitely won me over.  He and Quaid make an excellent team, and even the predictability of the plot doesn't diminish their chemistry.Sadly lacking was chemistry between Topher and Scarlett.  Her performance was curiously flat, considering the amount of critical praise and award nominations being heaped on her.  In this film, she just did not give Topher much to work with, although he did his very best.  It should have been effortless for her, but instead it all seemed oddly *forced*.  As a fan of her work in ""Ghost World"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" I have to say that her performance in this film felt phoned-in to me.  There's just this *sameness* about her that I found irksome, because she keeps using it in all her films, and this is the first film where it really didn't work.  But she was very pretty in the movie, which even a blind audience member would have noticed, because the characters kept continuously repeating it over and over as if none of us could see her.  Or maybe they just needed a reason to justify her presense in the film over a less overexposed actress.  Either way, it was overkill and I got sick of hearing it pretty quickly.There's a nice ""Waiting For Godot"" element with a Malcolm McDowell CEO type character who is responsible for all the corporate shuffling and reshuffling.  However, the script would have been better off if the writers had kept him as a Godot figure instead of introducing him to us in the most forced scene of the entire movie.  It's the obligatory scene where the main character makes a Big Speech in Front of Everyone and Changes People's Minds (or at least one key character's mind -- see ""Jerry Maguire"") or Comes To An Important Realization (see any romantic comedy).  This is the one scene that even Topher's exceptional acting cannot overcome, and he is cheated by its cheese.The DVD extras are just the usual roundup of mini behind-the-scenes ""featurettes"" and deleted scenes.  The commentary features the director and Topher.  Well, actually it features the director.  Topher chimes in occasionally, but it's Paul Weitz's show, no doubt about it.  His commentary gives some interesting tidbits and factoids (Did you know that Universal is no longer owned by Canal Plus?  Wow!!) but overall it just makes me hope that this film or some other will launch Topher's career enough that he doesn't feel obligated to do these silly commentary tracks any more.  I totally agree with Stephen King -- these things have become more boring than watching someone narrate a slide show of their summer vacation.Overall, this is a very satisfying rental!  It had too many faults for 4 stars, but it was a solid film, and an excellent launching pad for Topher's budding career.

He has just the right mixture of anxiousness and charm needed to make the character believable. He reminded me of Tom Hanks quite a bit. Dennis Quaid is also wonderful as the middle aged man being squeezed out of a job he's held for 20 some years. The whole vision of the company take over and ""synergy"" is a great metaphor for what's going on during this movie.That's not to say it doesn't have it's lighter moments.

892011,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B0007VZ9D0,L.A. Scene,"[1, 1]","Sometimes we all tend to get caught up on how movies do at the box office or at the Academy Awards.  But often there are movies that aren't the big name movies that are going to deliver what they truly intend to do - entertain the audience.  The movie ""In Good Company"" is one of those movies.  This movie was a 2004 release by producer, director, and writer Paul Weitz.  Slowly but surely, Paul Weitz is making a name for himself in all three of these creative areas.  ""In Good Company"" proves to be one of the finest movies Weitz has released to date.  In addition to writing a good script, Weitz as director assembles a terrific cast to carry out the script - headed by Dennis Quaid and Topher Grace.  ""In Good Company"" is a movie that provides a nice balance of light comedy with drama.The summary of the story is this:  Dennis Quaid plays Dan Foreman.  Dan is a 51 year old married man with a college-age and teenage daughter.  As Dan is struggling with his girls growing up, he discovers his wife Ann (played by Marg Helgenberger)  is pregnant.  Dan has worked at ""Sports America"" magazine for 23 years and is the Head of Advertising for the magazine.  As is typical with Corporate America, ""Sports America"" is taken over by a larger company.  Following the takeover, a young hotshot with no experience in magazine advertising named Carter Duryea (played by Topher Grace) is brought in to become the new Head of Advertising.  While Carter has been tasked with cutting the staff back, he offers to keep Dan on as his right-hand ""wingman"".  Carter has his own problems too.  His wife has just left him - and he has feeling the pressure of having to adjust to a job that he isn't qualified.  While both Dan and Carter struggle with individual personal and professional problems, things get more complicated when Carter starts to date Dan's college-age daughter, Alex (played by Scarlett Johansson).  This will throw a monkey-wrench into what is already a tense working relationship between the two.Dennis Quaid is probably one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood.  He delivers a solid performance as the 50something Dan Foreman.  Part of what I think makes Quaid a great choice to play Dan is that he can mix it up when it comes to the ""Comedy-Drama"" type of role.  Even Dan's body language is well done - this particularly seen well at the beginning of the movie when Dan finds a home pregnancy kit in the trash.  Quaid delivers some funny lines - one memorable one is when he finds out Ann is pregnant he says: ""You're pregnant?! Holy Crap!  Does it feel like a boy?""  We see Quaid in a very funny moment when Dan turns the tables on his guests at his 52nd birthday party.  We also see a sensitive side to Dan.  This is demonstrated in the latter stages of Ann's pregnancy as well as at the office when Carter announces he is going to fire two long-time associates of Dan's.Topher Grace might be a new name in Hollywood to keep tabs on (word he is slated to have a role in ""Spiderman 3"").  Grace does an outstanding job with the character of Carter Duryea.  I found the character of Carter Duryea to be a complex-one.  While Carter may same immature at times - at other times the complete opposite is true.  This is seen throughout Carter's personal and professional struggles.  We see Carter's loneliness that comes following the breakup of his marriage.  We see Carter struggling in his new role.  We also see Carter taking a very mature outlook when he gets involved with Dan's daughter Alex.  While at first, the character of Carter might not be likeable - throughout the movie I felt things begin to change.  Toward the end of the movie, I even began to see Carter become more of a ""hero"".The dynamics between Dennis Quaid and Topher Grace are what is going to make this movie really work.  At the beginning of the movie, we see Dan and Carter as adversaries - each in difficult positions in their new professional roles.  We also see some bonding between the two.  One of the best scenes is when Dan goes to Carter asking for advice on how to deal with his teenage daughter - then Carter turns the tables and asks Dan what is the secret to a successful marriage.  This scene provides a nice mix of the light comedy and drama that is a staple of this movie.  The realism that is brought to these roles by Quaid and Grace are going to be the key to making the dynamics work so well between not only the characters, but the actors.A lot of times, a good movie sometimes begins to break down in the last 20 minutes as it reaches it's conclusion.  Such is not the case with ""In Good Company"".  In fact, I think the last 20 minutes are really going to be the strength of the movie.  The ending of the movie is not very predictable.  The ending of the movie should be very pleasing to both audiences.The movie also does an outstanding job at demonstrating - and poking fun at the world of corporate takeovers.  If you have been around this environment, you will appreciate some of the indirect humor that comes out in this scenario.  I like when the CEO ""Teddy Z"" (played uncredited by Malcolm McDowell) pays a visit and gives a ""corporate vision"". I found a lot of the ""poking fun"" characteristics demonstrated in that particular scene.Overall, this is one movie that was overlooked by both audiences and to some extent the critics.  In addition to good acting, directing, and writing - there is some great soundtrack music.  Most of all, the movie entertains you.  This is a highly recommended film.",5,"This movie ""flew under the radar"" - terrific all-around film",1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,5512,"['Sometimes', 'tend', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'how', 'movies',

892012,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0007VZ9D0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 3]","The ads for ""In Good Company"" made it seem like a romantic comedy in which Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson fall in love while Dennis Quaid pulls his hair out because Scarlett is his daughter but Topher is his boss.  But once you actually see the film it is clear the subject is not romance but big business, and this film belongs not to the youngsters but to Quaid.  In fact, the movie is more about the two guys, while Johansson and Marg Helgenberger are largely wasted, although each has good moments.Dan Foreman (Quaid) is past 50 and he thinks finding the box of an empty home pregnancy test in the garbage is the worst thing that could happen to him, but he is sadly mistaken.  Dan works as an ad-exec for a ""Sports Illustrated"" type magazine and there his biggest concern is trying to land a big client to place print aids in the age of the Internet.  Then the magazine is gobbled up by Teddy K (Malcolm McDowell), a Murodch type media mogul and Carter Duryea (Grace), a hotshot half Dan's age, is sent in to replace him.  The ""good"" news is that Dan gets to stay on as Carter's ""wingman,"" but only because Carter is scared of his new responsibilities.  We know this because he confides it to Alex (Johansson) in the elevator, not knowing she is Dan's daughter.Dan cannot quit.  For that matter he cannot afford to be ""let go,"" and it is not just because of his age.  Every time another one of his colleagues is ""let go"" only underscores his vulnerability.  So even when he learns that his boss is dating his daughter there is really nothing he can do about it.  But we know that it is only a matter of time until we get to the straw that breaks this camel's back.  Then the question is whether Dan goes out in a blaze of glory or if a happy ending can be salvaged from this mess.Writer-director Paul Weitz's movie has a couple of things working for it beyond the performances of the cast who largely follow Quaid's lead in inhabiting their roles with an ease that allows us to play along with the rough spots.  The main thing is that the character of Carter is in play.  He has been raised in the corporate world of Teddy K and his eager minions, but some of Dan's wisdom is starting to rub off on the kid.  Maybe he is only hanging on to Dan because firing the father of the woman you love is not the sort of romantic gesture that usually works.  Then there is seeing what the business world he has been living in looks like to those on the outside.The other part that works is the resolution to the story, which is certainly not what anybody would expect given everything that had been set up in the film.  With movies today having an ending that qualifies as anything like a surprise is commendable.  It also makes up for the problem with the big moment when Dan fights back against the new corporate order.  It really is a bit too little, too late, and the conveniently contrived last chance to save the day and the corporadum ex machine the finishes the job have to be taken with a grain of salt.  But ""In Good Company"" is, after all, a comedy and not a tragedy, which is what a realistic story about corporate take overs almost always has to end up being.",4,Dennis Quaid has a major mid-life crisis at work,1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,3172,"['ads', 'Good', 'Company', 'made', 'seem', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'fall', 'love', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'hair', 'Scarlett', 'daughter', 'Topher', 'boss', 'once', 'actually', 'see', 'film', 'clear', 'subject', 'not', 'romance', 'big', 'business', 'film', 'not', 'youngsters', 'Quaid', 'fact', 'movie', 'more', 'two', 'guys', 'Johansson', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'are', 'largely', 'wasted', 'good', 'moments.Dan', 'Foreman', 'Quaid', 'past', '50', 'finding', 'box', 'empty', 'home', 'pregnancy', 'test', 'garbage', 'worst', 'thing', 'could', 'happen', 'sadly', 'mistaken', 'Dan', 'ad-exec', 'Sports', 'Illustrated', 'type', 'magazine', 'biggest', 'concern', 'trying', 'land', 'big', 'client', 'place', 'print', 'aids', 'age', 'Internet', 'Then', 'magazine', 'gobbled', 'up', 'Teddy', 'K', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Murodch', 'type', 'media', 'mogul', 'Carter', 'Duryea', 'Grace', 'hotshot', 'half', 'Dan', 'age', 'sent', 'replace', 'good', 'news', 'Dan', 'stay', 'Carter', 'wingman', 'only', 'Carter', 'scared', 'new', 'responsibilities', 'know', 'Alex', 'Johansson', 'elevator', 'not', 'knowing', 'Dan', 'daughter.Dan', 'can', 'not', 'quit', 'matter', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'be', 'let', 'go', 'not', 'just', 'age', 'time', 'one', 'colleagues', 'let', 'go', 'only', 'vulnerability', 'So', 'even', 'when', 'boss', 'dating', 'daughter', 'really', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'know', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'get', 'straw', 'camel', 'back', 'Then', 'question', 'Dan', 'out', 'blaze', 'glory', 'happy', 'ending', 'can', 'be', 'salvaged', 'mess.Writer-director', 'Paul', 'Weitz', 'movie', 'couple', 'things', 'working', 'performances', 'cast', 'who', 'largely', 'follow', 'Quaid', 'lead', 'inhabiting', 'roles', 'ease', 'play', 'along', 'rough', 'spots', 'main', 'thing', 'character', 'Carter', 'play', 'been', 'raised', 'corporate', 'world', 'Teddy', 'K', 'eager', 'minions', 'Dan', 'wisdom', 'starting', 'rub', 'off', 'kid', 'Maybe', 'only', 'hanging', 'Dan', 'firing', 'father', 'woman', 'love', 'not', 'sort', 'romantic', 'gesture', 'usually', 'Then', 'seeing', 'what', 'business', 'world', 'been', 'living', 'looks', 'outside.The', 'other', 'part', 'resolution', 'story', 'certainly', 'not', 'what', 'anybody', 'would', 'expect', 'given', 'everything', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'film', 'movies', 'today', 'having', 'ending', 'anything', 'surprise', 'commendable', 'also', 'up', 'problem', 'big', 'moment', 'when', 'Dan', 'back', 'new', 'corporate', 'order', 'really', 'bit', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'conveniently', 'contrived', 'last', 'chance', 'save', 'day', 'corporadum', 'ex', 'machine', 'finishes', 'job', 'have', 'be', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt', 'Good', 'Company', 'comedy', 'not', 'tragedy', 'what', 'realistic', 'story', 'corporate', 'take', 'overs', 'almost', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'being']",N/A

It strays occasionally into the obvious, but, overall, it's enormously entertaining. While the satire and drama elements are marred by pat endings, the romance part is given a blissfully hopeful, rather than a happy, ending.Dan [Dennis Quaid] is a high powered advertising executive at a big sports magazine. At age 52, he's at the top of his game. Out of nowhere, his company is bought by a media conglomerate headed by a billionaire megalomaniac. To Dan's horror, his new boss is a 26-year old kid named Carter [Topher Grace]. In typical early 21st Century fashion, Carter has arrived through sheer ambition and charm. He has zero experience in advertising. Carter does, however, have some experience in romance. He meets and falls deeply in love with Alex [Scarlett Johansson]. As fate would have it.

But the films they have directed I haven't liked one bit.  This is the first film that they have directed that I really think is worth seeing.  Its only fatal flaw in my mind is Scarlett Johansson.  She is an incredibly overrated actress in my humble opinion and she really sinks the pic.  Had a better actress been cast in her role I think the film would have worked so much better.  Its sad too because Dennis Quaid gives an admirable performance, truly brilliant at times as does Topher Grace who seems to get better and better with every film I see him in.  Marg Helgenberger from CSI is also quite good in this film.  David Paymer is great as well as Frankie Faison in their respective supporting roles.  The story is quite interesting as well...I just thought that Johannson really hurt the film in a crucial role.  SPOILER AHEAD There is an important scene in the film towards the end in a restaraunt where Quaid discovers that Johansson his daughter has been sleeping with his boss played by Grace and the scene winds up not really carrying of the dramatic weight it could have because of her lack of range and emotionaly sincerity.  Quaid is giving his all in the scene and acting wise she's just whatever about the whole thing.  An unfortunate let down that kept me from really loving the film.

I was pleasantly surprised.  The movie has a number of funny moments, but it also succeeds in seeming ""real"" in a sense.  I found myself interested in what was happening in the lives of both Dennis Quaid and Topher Grace.  A few of the other characters had some appeal, but these two guys were by far the most interesting.  Dennis Quaid really shines in his role.  I was a little disappointed by the character played by Scarlett Johanssen.  She is good actress, but the role just didn't seem to have much soul to it.  Still, the story of the two lead characters is the real key to the film; her character is just required to add an element of awkwardness to their relationship.I was also pleased with the way the film ended.

It plays with your expectations and goes in a surprising direction each time. The premise reeled me in, as this film is about a man who has been at a Sports Magazine his whole working life and during a merger, he suddenly finds himself working for someone young enough to be his son. Such tensions are relevant in today's immoral corporate culture where loyalty and longevity are no longer valued, where people are only as good as their last ad campaign.Dennis Quaid as an actor has done an amazing thing in this century, as his roles and movie choices have improved. I'm not sure if this is positive side effect of his falling out with Meg Ryan (whose career, on the other hand, only suffered since their 2000 breakup). Between Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid, Kevin was my favorite in the 1990s, but now I think Dennis Quaid has the upper hand. He is great in this film and comes across as a decent person...someone you'd love to have as a boss.Topher Grace is amazing, as he is in every film I've seen him in so far. He has the nervous, fidgety, inexperienced, fresh-out-of-college-and-in-way-over-his-head persona down perfectly. He makes a good team with Dennis Quaid and I like the juxtaposition between the breakup of Topher's marriage against the strength of Dennis' marriage. What I get from watching this film is that while our corporations may value the young hotshots who lack experience but make up for that in arrogance, that sometimes, experience does matter. A person who believes in his job and is committed to it is a far better person to be promoted than one who is only using the company as a stepping stone to bigger and better things. If anyone doubts this...look at Enron and the lack of loyalty to the company there. Incompetence should never be rewarded, no matter how ""brilliant"" some upstart might seem.The ending wasn't typical of most Hollywood films and its a logical ending that works out for the best for everyone involved. Scarlett Johannsen is good in this film, and even though I didn't buy her relationship with Topher Grace, it was an interesting subplot to the whole film. Besides the story and acting, I also loved the music of the soundtrack. All in all, the film makes some good points about our corporate culture even though the big dramatic scene was a bit of a stretch (when Dennis Quaid questions the head honcho). None of the flaws take away from the overall beauty of this film. It is worth seeing and owning.",5,Amazing!!!

Serving as his new boss is Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), an upstart 26 year-old with little practical experience in ad sales. Making matters more complicated, Foreman's daughter, Alex (Scarlett Johansson) wants to transfer to NYU (a much more expensive school than SUNY, where she was previously taking classes), and he's just found out that he has another child on the way. Duryea's own life is no less complicated. His wife has just left him, and he knows that he's not quite qualified for his new job. When Careter meets Alex, he almost immediately falls for her, and the two must keep the relationship secret from her father. What results is a wrenchingly true portrait of human relationships.I thought this was a great film. What can I say about Dennis Quaid? First of all, he still looks great. And throughout his career, the guy has kept working. He turns in a great performance in this movie. His character deals with alot of difficult situations, and Quaid allows the viewer to see how Foreman struggles with many of his decisions. But Foreman always acts with the kind of touching, good-guy grace that endears you to him. I thought that overall, this was Quaid's film. He really shines in it, displaying all of the acting chops he's gained in a long career of experience. Topher Grace is wonderful as well as the smooth-talking, ambitious Carter Duryea, who suffers from loneliness and an aimlessness that he can't, at first, comprehend. Scarlett Johansson, as Alex, also offers a subtle performance. Some of her work near the end of the film is really exceptional.This is not necessarily an uplifting movie. The characters are, by turns, depressed, hopeless, scared, annoyed. But life is messy. And this movie portrays real life, with all of its uncomfortable realities. While the film does not end on a depressing note, all of the character's struggles are not wrapped up in a neat little bow. Some ambiguity is evident in the ending.This would be a good film for teens, as there is no nudity and little language.

Referring to the extra features, some parts of Dennis Quaid's character was based on his own deceased father and he mentioned it that at times, it's hard not be emotional about scenes that he needed to edit out to prevent it to be running close to three hours long.  This is a movie that questions about the ethics of corporate raiding in modern American society where many ordinary people's lives are destroyed.  The closure of ENRON made this movie even more pertinent.  The new generation that embraces this new idea of getting successful in a very short period of time comes in the form of Topher Grace (from The 70's Show) whilst Dennis Quaid's character is the last remaining middle manager who is facing the threat of being made redundant to reduce costs.  Both of them have different values and undoubtedly, coming into conflicts.  Situation worsened when Topher got himself involved with Quaid's daughter, the illuminating Scarlett Johanssen.  Once again, she shows her versatility in portraying the daddy's girl and also, a girl that's transforming into a matured lady that gets to choose what she needs and wants to do in life.  Somehow, all comes out right in the end.  This movie reflects life as it is.  There are unexpected bumps and surprises along the way, but they seem to sort themselves out.  The movie ends in an open-ended manner but in a positive tone, suggesting of a future that's filled with hope.  A light-hearted movie that is honest and down to earth.

Anyone who hasn't caught his fresh-face boyish looks in P.S. has missed a gem of wry comedy.  In Good Company, we get more of the same.  Movie stars have a shtick and Topher takes over where Tom Hanks left off, but with a difference, Topher is manlier in his sentimentality.  When he hugs Dennis Quaid at the end of the film, he does so as a young man that has learned a tough lesson, a man that has matured.  I love Tom Hanks, but there's always a hanky ready, it's expected.The other great thing about In Good Company, it's a film for adults about business.  Sure, corporations buy each other, spin off a department, shuttle their employees about, provide benefits like healthcare, education, life insurance, and a decent salary. They also fire workers for all kinds of unintelligible reasons.  Personally, I love corporations and I don't care what out-of-touch Hollywood Liberals think. The folks that work at corporations are no better or worse than in most microcosms.  Maybe academics and film actors are perfect in their love for humanity, but corporate man (Dennis Quaid)is concerned with paying his mortgage, sending the daughter (Scarlett Johansson) to college, and doing a good job, an ethical job at work.Young hotshot Grace causes mayhem when he becomes boss to the much older Quaid, and more mayhem when he beds Quaid's athletic daughter.  None of these events happens because Grace is a bad person; he's a corporate workaholic that has succeeded right out of college beyond his wildest dreams but without a family life and without a tender wife.  In fact, Grace is alone with his Porsche.  Quaid's family looks like the Garden of Eden to our glib executive.Will Topher Grace find freedom from frivolous ""pseudo-religious corporate think,"" and can Quaid save his job, coming to terms with his middle-age crisis.

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[2, 2]","In Good Company isn't a hilarious comedy, nor a serious, ""edge-of-your-seat"" drama - yet something about it made it one of the most absorbing movies of 2005, pleasantly fascinating and easy to watch.  The story is about a middle-aged sales exec (Dennis Quaid) who's company is sold, with over-night demotion and a new boss (Topher Grace), a young whipper-snapper half his age and pathetically callow, though exuding infectious confidence and ambition of youth.  The new boss even naively falls for his older worker's daughter, oblivious to the obvious impracticality.So without a lot of hilarious comedy nor a suspenseful plotline, what makes In Good Company so interesting?  Two things I think.  One, the movie starts out with a premise that lends itself to extremely cynical comedy (like the Simpsons), but very realistically and gradually rises above that temptation to a conclusion that's uplifting in spite of the realistic situation.  Second, the unusual platonic chemistry between the two male leads seems real and strangely appealing, like you want to know these people and root for their friendship.  You don't see that done well in the movies often, and this is probably the most effective case since Cary Grant and Ronald Coleman in Talk Of The Town (in which they were in a romantic triangle with Jean Arthur, so it's really not the same situation).I'm afraid you'll just have to watch the movie to see what I mean.",5,"Realistic but not too cynical humor, good chemistry.",1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,1427,"['Good', 'Company', ""n't"", 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'serious', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'drama', 'yet', 'something', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'absorbing', 'movies', '2005', 'pleasantly', 'fascinating', 'easy', 'watch', 'story', 'middle-aged', 'sales', 'exec', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'who', 'company', 'sold', 'over-night', 'demotion', 'new', 'boss', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'young', 'whipper-snapper', 'half', 'age', 'pathetically', 'callow', 'exuding', 'infectious', 'confidence', 'ambition', 'youth', 'new', 'boss', 'even', 'naively', 'older', 'worker', 'daughter', 'oblivious', 'obvious', 'impracticality.So', 'lot', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'suspenseful', 'plotline', 'what', 'Good', 'Company', 'so', 'interesting', 'Two', 'things', 'think', 'One', 'movie', 'out', 'premise', 'extremely', 'cynical', 'comedy', 'Simpsons', 'very', 'realistically', 'gradually', 'rises', 'temptation', 'conclusion', 'uplifting', 'spite', 'realistic', 'situation', 'Second', 'unusual', 'platonic', 'chemistry', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'real', 'strangely', 'appealing', 'want', 'know', 'people', 'root', 'friendship', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'done', 'well', 'movies', 'often', 'probably', 'most', 'effective', 'case', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Ronald', 'Coleman', 'Talk', 'Town', 'were', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'really', 'not', 'same', 'situation', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'mean']",N/A

To facilitate my reviewing, I keep a list of books that I have read or movies I have seen or albums I have listened to that I would like at some point to write a review about.  I saw IN GOOD COMPANY about three weeks prior to writing this review, but I have to confess that from about five minutes after having finished watching it to this very moment, I haven't given it a second's thought.  And therein is the problem with the film:  while it is moderately entertaining while you are watching it, it will be entirely forgotten as soon as you are done.The plot is simple:  a marketing exec in his early fifties is demoted and given a boss half his age when a large corporation takes over his magazine.  The young boss has a brief but not a lasting affair with his daughter, who is an undergraduate at NYU.  Many of the former employees are fired as corporate down-sizing takes hold.  Eventually, the company sells the magazine and the young boss gets released and the middle-aged exec gets his job back.  To be honest, in spite all this, nothing much really happens in the film.  It is all just OK.  The script is just OK, the plot is just OK, the production is just OK.  As a result, there just isn't a whole lot to remember.  In other words, it is a solid and completely unspectacular Hollywood product.The cast was good, but given a much better cast wouldn't have faired much better since there was so little to work with.  Dennis Quaid was good as usual, and Scarlett Johansson, she of the beautiful eyes and mouth, was interesting to look at.  Topher Grace could have been vastly improved upon, and I'm not quite sure why he was cast in the role of the young hot shot executive.  Sometimes casting is just a mystery.All in all, there are worse uses of time than seeing this film, and many better uses.

To add insult to injury, Dan, the exec, is shocked to discover that Carter, the boss, has fallen in love with his beloved college-aged daughter, fetchingly played by Scarlett Johansson.""In Good Company"" has a few pertinent things to say about how the callous corporate world, concerned primarily with profits and the bottom-line, often mistreats its workers, but the film suffers from heavy-handed plot mechanics, facile ironies, and so many musical montage sequences that the film begins to resemble a cut-rate version of ""The Graduate"" at times. (David Byrne and Peter Gabriel have provided the Simon and Garfunkel-ish score).Still, there are a number of positive elements to be found in the film.  Dennis Quaid brings a quiet dignity to the role of a middle-aged man who is slowly but surely being put out to pasture to make way for a generation that values youth, energy and loyalty to the CEO above all else.  As the 20-something boss, Topher Grace, in many ways, has the more challenging part, making Carter into a sympathetic figure where other actors might have played him as a hard-nosed villain.  Weitz is careful to show that Carter is really a decent kind of fellow under all the bluster and ambition - deferential, insecure, and eager to find some meaning in life beyond career and work.The performances and a few genuinely insightful, touching moments help to make up for the shaky plotting and the fact that the humor is so low-keyed that it is practically nonexistent.

So on the surface, In Good Company looked right up my alley.  The movie stars Dennis Quaid as a guy who just found out that his wife was pregnant and he was demoted following corporate takeover all within 24 hours.  His new boss, played by the dude from That 70's Show not currently married to Demi Moore, is young enough to be his kid and not necessarily qualified for the job.  Then his new boss promptly hooks up his daughter completely on the down low.Here inlays the problem with the movie, it doesn't know if it wants to be a family drama, a romantic comedy or a social commentary on today's corporate world.  Each upon itself would make a good movie are even a combination of two would be find, but having all three storylines weighs down the movie bringing to a running time to a very long running time of two hours which is too much for this type of movie.  And looking at the amount of deleted scenes, it could have gone even longer closing in on three hours.  Needless to say, avoid any potential Director's Cut that may be released in the future.With that said, the acting almost makes up for the movie's flaws.

How many recent films have stood for something fundamental and still managed to be heart-warming and funny without being schticky? Let's count them on an amputee's fingers.The main thrust of In Good Company is to sketch the lives of people caught in the throes of capricious M&As; but it offers an accurate glimpse into modern office environments -- motivating co-workers, intra-office hostilities, nepotism and favoritism, and so forth -- much of which is handled with uncanny weight.The movie is not without it lighter moments though, every mention of harebrained co-branding strategies or of platitudes like ""synergy"" had me grinning and cringing at the same time.While the film's ultimate resolutions are too feel-good for its own good, it couches a great deal of sensitivity for its characters. We readily relate to the folks in the company. The flurry of indiscrimate downsizing is not easy to watch, nor is the apprehension thereof.On the family front, father-daughter relationships are well played out. Dennis Quaid in his bipolar role of experience and naivete guns for the Jack Nicholesque and nearly gets there.But no question, the show belongs to the youngsters. Scarlett Johansson continues in the same understated confident streak as Lost in Translation. Her chemistry with Topher Grace feels very natural, who by the way has to be among the most promising young actors around. His versatile performance hits just the right notes in both measured humor and complex poise. That we're able to feel for his whippersnapper character at all is evidence enough.For its assured near-noirish tone or the soft rock on its soundtrack that captures two ends of the generational spectrum, I'd say this film would make for an exquisite evening rental.

That might not be a problem for cool young Turks, but I had a job that I had to be at in just a few hours and I was still busy counting sheep.  I found this movie on HBO and figured it would be something that would entertain me, but not enough to keep me awake.I was right.  And while that was good for me, it doesn't speak well for the movie's content.Dennis Quaid is a 52 year old department manager, suddenly marginalized in the face of a company shakeup.  His new boss is Carter, played with frenetic energy by Topher Grace (That Seventies Show).  Adding insult to injury, Carter begins dating Quaid's NYU daughter, played by Scarlett Johansson.Cue the hijinks.Of course there's a lesson to be learned from this movie:  after all, what would Hollywood do with its self-serving smugness if they wouldn't try and moralize to the rest of the world.  Spoiler alert!  Carter - and the rest of the new management - winds up getting schooled by Dennis Quaid with his wisdom accrued over years - nay decades - of experience.  Yes, experience triumphs over MBA's, the slow and steady tortoise beats the fast-moving hare, and they all live happily ever after.  And scene.Except - and this must be said - it's highly ironic that Hollywood put out this movie.  Really, Hollywood?  Young guns get beat by the old guard?  Remind me why actress in their 40's (save for a select few) are put out to pasture while roles are relegated only to the next PYT?  Actresses of a 'certain age' (read 40+) are either eccentric aunts, wise mothers, or Meryl Streep.  James Bond keeps getting older but his Bond girls are stuck solidly in their twenties - low thirties.So Hollywood, if you really want to maintain your smug, righteous moralizing center, let's see you find roles for Ms.  Johansson not only when she's in her twenties and thirties for forties and fifties as well.",3,Put me to sleep...but that's a good thing (?),1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,1966,"['turned', 'movie', 'act', 'desperation', 'was', 'one', 'morning', 'still', 'had', ""n't"", 'fallen', 'asleep', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'problem', 'cool', 'young', 'Turks', 'had', 'job', 'had', 'be', 'just', 'few', 'hours', 'was', 'still', 'busy', 'counting', 'sheep', 'found', 'movie', 'HBO', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'would', 'entertain', 'not', 'enough', 'keep', 'awake.I', 'was', 'right', 'was', 'good', ""n't"", 'speak', 'well', 'movie', 'content.Dennis', 'Quaid', '52', 'year', 'old', 'department', 'manager', 'suddenly', 'marginalized', 'face', 'company', 'shakeup', 'new', 'boss', 'Carter', 'played', 'frenetic', 'energy', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Seventies', 'Show', 'Adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'Carter', 'dating', 'Quaid', 'NYU', 'daughter', 'played', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson.Cue', 'hijinks.Of', 'course', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'movie', 'what', 'would', 'Hollywood', 'do', 'self-serving', 'smugness', 'would', ""n't"", 'try', 'moralize', 'rest', 'world', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'Carter', 'rest', 'new', 'management', 'up', 'getting', 'schooled', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'wisdom', 'accrued', 'years', 'nay', 'decades', 'experience', 'Yes', 'experience', 'triumphs', 'MBA', 'slow', 'steady', 'tortoise', 'fast-moving', 'hare', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'scene.Except', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'highly', 'ironic', 'Hollywood', 'put', 'out', 'movie', 'Really', 'Hollywood', 'Young', 'get', 'beat', 'old', 'guard', 'why', 'actress', '40', 'save', 'select', 'few', 'are', 'put', 'out', 'pasture', 'roles', 'are', 'relegated', 'only', 'next', 'PYT', 'Actresses', ""'certain"", 'age', 'read', '40+', 'are', 'eccentric', 'aunts', 'wise', 'mothers', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'James', 'Bond', 'getting', 'older', 'Bond', 'girls', 'are', 'stuck', 'solidly', 'twenties', 'low', 'thirties.So', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'want', 'maintain', 'smug', 'righteous', 'moralizing', 'center', 'let', 'see', 'find', 'roles', 'Ms.', 'Johansson', 'not', 'only', 'when', 'twenties', 'thirties', 'forties', 'fifties', 'as', 'well']",N/A

After recently watching ""House of Flying Daggers"" I have disagree that this is a melodrama.  The actors and characters are all fairly realistic.  The romance is not contrived.  There is no ""meet cute"" for the couple.  The older couple are in love, but they clearly face obstacles in their relationship - just as in real life.

Actually, `In Good Company' is less likely to entertain you as comedy (though it is); its charms are more like that of satire based on well-acted character-driven drama.In short, it is about Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) 51 years-old working for a sports magazine for more than 20 years. After his company has been taken over by one mysterious ""Teddy K"" (uncredited Malcom McDowell), Dan is demoted from the job. His new boss is Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), hotshot manager who is half his age.In the corporate world this is nothing special, but what is special about the relation between them is that Carter falls in love with a nice college student Alex (Scarlett Johansson), who happens to be Dan's daughter. Interestingly, in spite of the demotion, Dan finds Carter likable and honest in his own way. But their unlikely and uneasy friendship is tested when Dan comes to know Carter is darting with his daughter.`In Good Company' is supposed to be about the corporate world where sheer nonsense can pass for wisdom, and quasi-religious faith often covers up the unreasonableness of business, but the satire of the film is not fully explored. There is nothing unique or original about what Paul Weitz says about the corporate world, and the office workers (including David Paymer) always look like caricatures, only found in the soundstage of Hollywood. Though the central three characters are interesting, the film is not totally clich&eacute;-free. The bored wife of Carter (Selma Blair, wasted) is a very thankless role, virtually pointless, and so is Philip Baker Hall, whose role is too weak to conclude the film with a satisfactory resonance at the end of the story. Even the role of Marg Helgenberger as Dan's wife lacks substantial weight, appearing intermittently to show you the image of perfect family.[GOOD ACTING FROM] However, the three principal actors -- Quaid, Grace, and Johansson - are so good that you almost forget these flaws of the film. Actually, for whatever reasons the film is praised so far, they cannot be without their good acting. There is considerable chemistry between Topher Grace and Dennis Quaid/Scarlett Johansson (though her role is smaller than the others), and thanks to them the characters are all believable.The best way to describe `In Good Company' is, to me, ""a surprising good off-beat comedy."" The characters sometimes look paper-thin, and there is no denying that Malcom McDowell as Teddy K is a very strange decision, but for all its lack of edge, `In Good Company' has sophisticated taste and humor to amuse us.",4,(3.5 STARS) A Little Light-weight But Pleasant Off-beat Comedy with Good Acting from Topher Grace,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,2780,"['Though', 'director', 'Paul', 'Weitz', 'best', 'known', 'teen', 'comedy', 'American', 'Pie', 'brother', 'uncredited', 'Chris', 'Good', 'Company', 'proves', 'main', 'interest', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'comedy', 'Pies', 'suggest', 'Actually', 'Good', 'Company', 'less', 'likely', 'entertain', 'comedy', 'charms', 'are', 'more', 'satire', 'based', 'well-acted', 'character-driven', 'drama.In', 'short', 'Dan', 'Foreman', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', '51', 'years-old', 'working', 'sports', 'magazine', 'more', '20', 'years', 'company', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'one', 'mysterious', 'Teddy', 'K', 'uncredited', 'Malcom', 'McDowell', 'Dan', 'demoted', 'job', 'new', 'boss', 'Carter', 'Duryea', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'hotshot', 'manager', 'who', 'age.In', 'corporate', 'world', 'nothing', 'special', 'what', 'special', 'relation', 'Carter', 'love', 'nice', 'college', 'student', 'Alex', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'be', 'Dan', 'daughter', 'Interestingly', 'spite', 'demotion', 'Dan', 'Carter', 'likable', 'honest', 'own', 'way', 'unlikely', 'uneasy', 'friendship', 'tested', 'when', 'Dan', 'know', 'Carter', 'darting', 'daughter.', 'Good', 'Company', 'supposed', 'be', 'corporate', 'world', 'where', 'sheer', 'nonsense', 'can', 'pass', 'wisdom', 'quasi-religious', 'faith', 'often', 'up', 'unreasonableness', 'business', 'satire', 'film', 'not', 'fully', 'explored', 'nothing', 'unique', 'original', 'what', 'Paul', 'Weitz', 'corporate', 'world', 'office', 'workers', 'including', 'David', 'Paymer', 'always', 'look', 'like', 'caricatures', 'only', 'found', 'soundstage', 'Hollywood', 'central', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'film', 'not', 'totally', 'clich', 'eacute', '-free', 'bored', 'wife', 'Carter', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'wasted', 'very', 'thankless', 'role', 'virtually', 'pointless', 'so', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'role', 'too', 'weak', 'conclude', 'film', 'satisfactory', 'resonance', 'end', 'story', 'Even', 'role', 'Marg', 'Helgenberger', 'Dan', 'wife', 'substantial', 'weight', 'appearing', 'intermittently', 'show', 'image', 'perfect', 'family', '[', 'GOOD', 'ACTING', 'FROM', ']', 'However', 'three', 'principal', 'actors', 'Quaid', 'Grace', 'Johansson', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'almost', 'forget', 'flaws', 'film', 'Actually', 'reasons', 'film', 'praised', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'acting', 'considerable', 'chemistry', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Dennis', 'Quaid/Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'role', 'smaller', 'others', 'thanks', 'characters', 'are', 'believable.The', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'Good', 'Company', 'surprising', 'good', 'off-beat', 'comedy', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'look', 'paper-thin', 'denying', 'Malcom', 'McDowell', 'Teddy', 'K', 'very', 'strange', 'decision', 'lack', 'edge', 'Good', 'Company', 'sophisticated', 'taste', 'humor', 'amuse']",N/A

The former leading man is now a handsome character actor, and a very good one. He's old enough to be Grace's father; indeed, that's the gimmick of this ungimmicky film, which is also very good. In a corporate takeover, Grace becomes his boss and falls for his daughter. Grace is endearing as a clueless ladder-climbing lad, but the older actor is indelible as the resilient dad. Quaid's new career in films has Academy Award written all over it.There is much to admire in this unblinking look at corporate survival. As a sort of executive suite swami, who settles everyone's hash at the end, Malcolm McDowell (another leading man who has aged well) relishes his incisive cameo. However, this is not what the movie is about. It's really interested in how people relate to one another, in the cliche of office jargon, ""up close and personal."" Not another corporate satire? Not another hug everybody movie? Sometimes the old formulas are transformed when directors know how to refresh them.Writer-director Paul Weitz, his editor and cinematographer, know how. The easy-flowing scenes between the father and his daughter (a reserved Scarlett Johannson), his pregnant wife, his new young boss and his office colleagues seem unforced and unrehearsed, as though they were just now happening. The ending, as the characters try to reorder their lives, is not a routine one, but it feels right. In fact, everything about ""In Good Company"" feels right.

Eventually though the young guy has to trust Quaid.  They make a big business deal which turns the corner for the company.  The young guy seems to actually be an OK kind of person but then the Big Company decides to sell off the smaller one.  The young guy gets canned, Quaid gets promoted to his old job again, the daughter dumps the young guy, and the young guy winds up jogging on a beach in LA, looking for another job.  The guys who got canned in the takeover get rehired and everything goes back to the way it was.Quaid offers the young guy a job but he declines.  The young guy meets the daughter in the elevator on the way out.  They exchange uncomfortable greetings.  She goes on her way.  End of story.You wind up feeling like, ""why did I waste 2 hours on this thing?""  It wasn't a Tragedy.  It wasn't a Comedy.  It wasn't uplifting.  It didn't have any moral.  It was like somebody needed to make a movie, any movie, so they hired Quaid, got a couple of writers, threw together a script over a weekend and away they went.  I'm glad I only paid a couple of dollars for this movie.",2,Pointless,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,1702,"['hate', 'pan', 'something', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'done', 'really', 'have', 'Oh', 'was', 'fine', 'usual', 'actors', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'problem', 'movie', 'point', 'other', 'sometimes', 'bigger', 'companies', 'buy', 'up', 'smaller', 'ones', 'then', 'make', 'poor', 'business', 'decisions', 'So', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'effect', 'had', 'Quaid', 'daughter', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'just', 'nothing', 'new', 'young', 'guy', 'over', 'Quaid', 'job', 'Quaid', 'demoted', 'other', 'people', 'get', 'fired', 'young', 'guy', 'having', 'affair', 'Quaid', 'daughter', 'Eventually', 'young', 'guy', 'trust', 'Quaid', 'make', 'big', 'business', 'deal', 'corner', 'company', 'young', 'guy', 'actually', 'be', 'OK', 'kind', 'person', 'then', 'Big', 'Company', 'sell', 'off', 'smaller', 'one', 'young', 'guy', 'canned', 'Quaid', 'promoted', 'old', 'job', 'again', 'daughter', 'young', 'guy', 'young', 'guy', 'up', 'jogging', 'beach', 'LA', 'looking', 'job', 'guys', 'who', 'got', 'canned', 'takeover', 'get', 'rehired', 'everything', 'back', 'way', 'was.Quaid', 'young', 'guy', 'job', 'young', 'guy', 'daughter', 'elevator', 'way', 'out', 'exchange', 'uncomfortable', 'greetings', 'way', 'End', 'story.You', 'wind', 'up', 'feeling', 'why', 'did', 'waste', '2', 'hours', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'Tragedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'Comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'uplifting', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'moral', 'was', 'somebody', 'needed', 'make', 'movie', 'movie', 'hired', 'Quaid', 'got', 'couple', 'writers', 'threw', 'together', 'script', 'weekend', 'away', 'went', ""'m"", 'glad', 'only', 'paid', 'couple', 'dollars', 'movie']",N/A
