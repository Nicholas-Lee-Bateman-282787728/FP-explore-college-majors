If you have never seen it, but would like to, then I would suggest getting this version offered here, from a company named ""GodzillaFlix."" The price is kind of steep for a DVDR, ($29.95 + shipping is what I paid) and beware that's it's a 79 minute version and not the full 86 minute version. Also, this film is not in it's original aspect ratio here, but rather a full screen pan and scan. As for the print, it happens to be the best one I've seen thus far, but as a serious collector, I would rather have the full movie and in its correct aspect ratio. I did order this version offered here, and personally, I wasn't happy with it. The company that sold it was very professional about my concerns and promptly took care of all issues that I had.",3,Just a heads-up,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,808,"['Crossed', 'Swords', 'rather', 'difficult', 'film', 'get', 'copy', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'would', 'like', 'then', 'would', 'suggest', 'getting', 'version', 'offered', 'here', 'company', 'named', 'GodzillaFlix', 'price', 'kind', 'steep', 'DVDR', '29.95', '+', 'shipping', 'what', 'paid', 'beware', '79', 'minute', 'version', 'not', 'full', '86', 'minute', 'version', 'Also', 'film', 'not', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'here', 'rather', 'full', 'screen', 'pan', 'scan', 'print', 'be', 'best', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thus', 'far', 'serious', 'collector', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'full', 'movie', 'correct', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'did', 'order', 'version', 'offered', 'here', 'personally', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'company', 'sold', 'was', 'very', 'professional', 'concerns', 'promptly', 'took', 'care', 'issues', 'had']",N/A

So, I sprung the major money for this one-though I'm glad I only spent for a used copy.  The color could be better, though not terrible for such and old movie.  However, it is the sound that is the biggest disappointment.  While you could follow a lot of what was said, there were frequent times where it faded in and out so bad that you consistently lost portions of it.The movie's original language is Italian, and it is dubbed into English.  This compounds the issues presented by the volume problems.  If you can rent this one, I would do it, unless you're just a big hardcore Flynn, or classic movie fan.  It was difficult to follow.  Because of that it felt like a fight to understand all the way through the film.  Hence, it was not a relaxing experience, but a frustrating one.  Plot, acting, directing--all good.  However, the volume issues make this a big risk, and to me, not worth big money.

1389291,A2NE7D8GC41UCL,B0048MD8KU,"Karen Amrhein ""Karen A.""","[9, 11]","I was excited to find ""Crossed Swords"" available on DVD, having heard about it for many years and never having seen it until now.  I'm  glad I purchased it as I find the movie is delightful.Errol Flynn looks quite good in the film, considering his age and the ravages his lifestyle has inflicted.  In fact, he looks better here than in any of his other 1950s films I've seen.  He has energy and wit and is charming in this tailor-made role.  Gina Lollobrigida is quite engaging in her part as well.  In fact, all the actors do very capable work.The story is slight -- essentially opera buffa -- but has lots of humor, action, and romance.  The settings, costumes, and cinematography are simply splendid.  I took great pleasure in just gazing at the gorgeous costumes.  They really are something.I'm grateful to Gozillaflix.com / A1A TV for making this film available on DVD.  The quality of the restored picture is excellent.  However, the DVD itself has a number of disappointing flaws, ranging from the tolerable to the inexcusable:1) Between 6 and 7 minutes of footage is missing.  Occasionally, this results in little jumps in the story.  This is unfortunate, but I assume Gozillaflix was working from the best and most complete print available.2) The sound is pretty awful.  I wish they'd cleaned up the soundtrack during the remastering process.  It's very scratchy and the dialogue is often quite hard to decipher.  Concentration is required.3) The DVD has just three chapter markers, as I recall, and these are badly placed.4) The DVD begins with a 50-second advertisement of Gozillaflix.com titles.  There's no chapter marker at the start of the film, so the only way to avoid the advertisement is to fast forward through it to the beginning of the movie.  Not cool.5) A highly annoying rainbow colored animated Gozillaflix logo appears from the lower left side of the screen SIX TIMES during the film for five or six seconds each time.  The logo appears around 9:11, 21:47, 40:25, 51:40, 1:04:41, and 1:14:25.  REALLY not cool.THANKFULLY, I was able to import the film into Corel VideoStudio Pro and edit out the 50-second advertisement, add some noise-reduction to the soundtrack, create a proper main menu and chapter markers, and -- with a great deal of time and effort -- eradicate the Gozillaflix logos.  Of the six appearances of these, two were pretty easy to eliminate seamlessly, two could be almost seamlessly eliminated with much time and effort, and two could be readily masked with a far less egregious ""crossed swords"" image that I created from the title cards.So, the movie gets at least 4 stars, in my opinion.  The DVD itself gets 5 stars for picture quality (for a 60 year old film, and a rare one at that), 2 stars for sound, and 1 star for presentation.  I recommend the DVD all the same, for fans of swashbucklers, rare films, and Errol Flynn or Gina Lollobrigida.",4,Signals Crossed,1337644800,"05 22, 2012",2012,2895,"['was', 'excited', 'find', 'Crossed', 'Swords', 'available', 'DVD', 'having', 'heard', 'many', 'years', 'never', 'having', 'seen', 'now', ""'m"", 'glad', 'purchased', 'find', 'movie', 'delightful.Errol', 'Flynn', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'considering', 'age', 'ravages', 'lifestyle', 'inflicted', 'fact', 'better', 'here', 'other', '1950s', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'energy', 'wit', 'charming', 'tailor-made', 'role', 'Gina', 'Lollobrigida', 'quite', 'engaging', 'part', 'well', 'fact', 'actors', 'do', 'very', 'capable', 'work.The', 'story', 'slight', 'essentially', 'opera', 'buffa', 'lots', 'humor', 'action', 'romance', 'settings', 'costumes', 'cinematography', 'are', 'simply', 'splendid', 'took', 'great', 'pleasure', 'just', 'gazing', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'really', 'are', 'something.I', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'Gozillaflix.com', '/', 'A1A', 'TV', 'making', 'film', 'available', 'DVD', 'quality', 'restored', 'picture', 'excellent', 'However', 'DVD', 'number', 'disappointing', 'flaws', 'ranging', 'tolerable', 'inexcusable:1', 'Between', '6', '7', 'minutes', 'footage', 'missing', 'Occasionally', 'results', 'little', 'jumps', 'story', 'unfortunate', 'assume', 'Gozillaflix', 'was', 'working', 'best', 'most', 'complete', 'print', 'available.2', 'sound', 'pretty', 'awful', 'wish', ""'d"", 'cleaned', 'up', 'soundtrack', 'remastering', 'process', 'very', 'scratchy', 'dialogue', 'often', 'quite', 'hard', 'decipher', 'Concentration', 'required.3', 'DVD', 'just', 'three', 'chapter', 'markers', 'recall', 'are', 'badly', 'placed.4', 'DVD', '50-second', 'advertisement', 'Gozillaflix.com', 'titles', 'chapter', 'marker', 'start', 'film', 'only', 'way', 'avoid', 'advertisement', 'fast', 'forward', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Not', 'cool.5', 'highly', 'annoying', 'rainbow', 'colored', 'animated', 'Gozillaflix', 'logo', 'lower', 'left', 'side', 'screen', 'SIX', 'TIMES', 'film', 'five', 'six', 'seconds', 'time', 'logo', '9:11', '21:47', '40:25', '51:40', '1:04:41', '1:14:25', 'REALLY', 'not', 'cool.THANKFULLY', 'was', 'able', 'import', 'film', 'Corel', 'VideoStudio', 'Pro', 'edit', 'out', '50-second', 'advertisement', 'add', 'noise-reduction', 'soundtrack', 'create', 'proper', 'main', 'menu', 'chapter', 'markers', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'effort', 'eradicate', 'Gozillaflix', 'logos', 'six', 'appearances', 'two', 'were', 'pretty', 'easy', 'eliminate', 'seamlessly', 'two', 'could', 'be', 'almost', 'seamlessly', 'eliminated', 'much', 'time', 'effort', 'two', 'could', 'be', 'readily', 'masked', 'far', 'less', 'egregious', 'crossed', 'swords', 'image', 'created', 'title', 'cards.So', 'movie', 'least', '4', 'stars', 'opinion', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'picture', 'quality', '60', 'year', 'old', 'film', 'rare', 'one', '2', 'stars', 'sound', '1', 'star', 'presentation', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'same', 'fans', 'swashbucklers', 'rare', 'films', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'Gina', 'Lollobrigida']",N/A
1389292,A1NFV45J3MCC4E,B0048MD8KU,Lightning Surfer,"[2, 4]","Here's a swashbuckler that is uncertain whether it wants to be a farce or an adventure tale.  The story itself is hard to swallow at times.  Pavoncello (Roldano Lupi), a treacherous counselor, schemes to overthrow the Duke from his throne and to imprison a womanizing rogue named Renzo (Errol Flynn) who could spoil his plans.  One of the devices that the vile advisor uses to obtain power is to pass a law requiring all eligible men over the age of 20 to marry as the children born from these unions would repopulate the nation after years of war.  While Renzo chooses to leave Italy to continue his skirt chasing ways, the Duke wrongly believes that Pavoncello has the best interests of the nation in mind.  As his influence grows, Pavoncello eventually turns on the Duke with the help of his allies.  Fortunately, Renzo discovers the peril that the Duke and all of Italy are in leading to a robust confrontation with the wicked counselor.  The climatic swordfight here is Errol Flynn's last great action scene before his death five years later.  Careful editing perhaps might have improved this movie, but we'll never know.  What remains is an uneven action/adventure that disappoints more than it succeeds.For Errol Flynn fans, there are two outstanding action sequences that should justify your purchase of this DVD (Gozillaflix.com).  Granted, the audio is poor in several spots, but the video quality was surprisingly good for the most part considering this movie has suffered from years of neglect.  Be warned that the Gozillaflix icon appears for a few seconds on several occasions throughout the DVD.  This is an industry faux pas.  It is one thing for TV channels to show their icon sporadically on a program, but on something a customer buys?  Unfortunately, Flynn fans will just have to tolerate this gaffe until another DVD release of ""Crossed Swords"" comes along - which I don't see that happening anytime soon.",2,Uneven swashbuckler for die-hard Errol Flynn fans only,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,1926,"['Here', 'swashbuckler', 'uncertain', 'be', 'farce', 'adventure', 'tale', 'story', 'hard', 'swallow', 'times', 'Pavoncello', 'Roldano', 'Lupi', 'treacherous', 'counselor', 'overthrow', 'Duke', 'throne', 'imprison', 'womanizing', 'rogue', 'named', 'Renzo', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'who', 'could', 'spoil', 'plans', 'One', 'devices', 'vile', 'advisor', 'obtain', 'power', 'pass', 'law', 'requiring', 'eligible', 'men', 'age', '20', 'marry', 'children', 'born', 'unions', 'would', 'repopulate', 'nation', 'years', 'war', 'Renzo', 'chooses', 'leave', 'Italy', 'continue', 'skirt', 'chasing', 'ways', 'Duke', 'wrongly', 'Pavoncello', 'best', 'interests', 'nation', 'mind', 'influence', 'grows', 'Pavoncello', 'eventually', 'Duke', 'help', 'allies', 'Fortunately', 'Renzo', 'peril', 'Duke', 'Italy', 'are', 'leading', 'robust', 'confrontation', 'wicked', 'counselor', 'climatic', 'swordfight', 'here', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'last', 'great', 'action', 'scene', 'death', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'Careful', 'editing', 'perhaps', 'might', 'have', 'improved', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'What', 'uneven', 'action/adventure', 'more', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'fans', 'are', 'two', 'outstanding', 'action', 'sequences', 'should', 'justify', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'Gozillaflix.com', 'Granted', 'audio', 'poor', 'several', 'spots', 'video', 'quality', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'considering', 'movie', 'suffered', 'years', 'neglect', 'Be', 'warned', 'Gozillaflix', 'icon', 'few', 'seconds', 'several', 'occasions', 'DVD', 'industry', 'faux', 'pas', 'one', 'thing', 'TV', 'channels', 'show', 'icon', 'sporadically', 'program', 'something', 'customer', 'buys', 'Unfortunately', 'Flynn', 'fans', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'tolerate', 'gaffe', 'DVD', 'release', 'Crossed', 'Swords', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'happening', 'anytime', 'soon']",N/A
