He is the creator of his own cinematic 'style'. It  consists of low camera angles, no close-ups, no camera movement, the camera  stays still. Probably the most quietly precise director of foreign cinema,  he is know as the most 'Japanese' director of Japan's filmmakers. In this  film he tells the story of an acting troupe who come to a small fishing  town. To reveal more of the plot would be to deny you the dramatic impact  of the film. While certainly not a technical marvel, it's raw power to move  us remains untouched, and even more because of Ozu's direction. As we see  the film evolve we feel him slowly coming toward us, but he doesn't creep  at us, he puts his friendly hand on our shoulder and makes us feel  comfortable. This film is a perfect introduction into Ozu's work, but also  stands well by itself. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!",5,"Quietly Powerful, Beautiful Filmmaking!!!",962668800,"07 4, 2000",2000,956,"['films', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'always', 'silent', 'poignancy', 'been', 'unmatched', 'cinema', 'creator', 'own', 'cinematic', 'low', 'camera', 'angles', 'close-ups', 'camera', 'movement', 'camera', 'still', 'Probably', 'most', 'quietly', 'precise', 'director', 'foreign', 'cinema', 'know', 'most', ""'Japanese"", 'director', 'Japan', 'filmmakers', 'film', 'story', 'acting', 'troupe', 'who', 'come', 'small', 'fishing', 'town', 'reveal', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'deny', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'technical', 'marvel', 'raw', 'power', 'move', 'untouched', 'even', 'more', 'Ozu', 'direction', 'see', 'film', 'feel', 'slowly', 'coming', ""n't"", 'creep', 'friendly', 'hand', 'shoulder', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'film', 'perfect', 'introduction', 'Ozu', 'work', 'also', 'well', 'scale', '1-10', 'give', 'film', '9']",Floating Weeds VHS

348396,A16CZRQL23NOIW,6302969670,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[1, 1]","""Floating weeds"" is without any doubt, the most absorbing masterpiece of this sublime director. A true personality gifted of pastoral poetry, around the profound familiar values.  His refined visual style, the way that every single frame captures with unerring elegance and nuance those unsaid feelings which nourish the soul of every one of us.A veteran kabuki actor now broken in years travels with his artistic team to a village that means so much for him. That is the town where an impetuous love took place, and the sublime fruit of that love left a child that now is a man of just twenty. He has always worried by him and financed all his studies. But now a sort of warm nostalgia persuades him to make a special visit. In order to meet him he introduces himself as an uncle. But the fierce jealous of his actual lover an actress of kabuki ruins everything he had planned. And so a set of unexpected events will take place around this apparently simple and affectionate of love and redemption.In few words, a colossal and unique masterpiece in its style. One of the most expensive jewels of the cinema.",5,The world is a wheel!,1244851200,"06 13, 2009",2009,1108,"['Floating', 'weeds', 'doubt', 'most', 'absorbing', 'masterpiece', 'sublime', 'director', 'true', 'personality', 'gifted', 'pastoral', 'poetry', 'profound', 'familiar', 'values', 'refined', 'visual', 'style', 'way', 'single', 'frame', 'captures', 'unerring', 'elegance', 'nuance', 'unsaid', 'feelings', 'nourish', 'soul', 'one', 'us.A', 'veteran', 'kabuki', 'actor', 'now', 'broken', 'years', 'travels', 'artistic', 'team', 'village', 'so', 'much', 'town', 'where', 'impetuous', 'love', 'took', 'place', 'sublime', 'fruit', 'love', 'left', 'child', 'now', 'man', 'just', 'twenty', 'always', 'worried', 'financed', 'studies', 'now', 'sort', 'warm', 'nostalgia', 'make', 'special', 'visit', 'order', 'meet', 'uncle', 'fierce', 'jealous', 'actual', 'lover', 'actress', 'kabuki', 'ruins', 'everything', 'had', 'planned', 'so', 'set', 'unexpected', 'events', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'apparently', 'simple', 'affectionate', 'love', 'redemption.In', 'few', 'words', 'colossal', 'unique', 'masterpiece', 'style', 'One', 'most', 'expensive', 'jewels', 'cinema']",Floating Weeds VHS
348397,A3KBGH3EPA07KW,6302969670,Max Hurst,"[28, 29]","I have only really discovered Ozu in the last year or so and in my mid-- life it is like entering a bright new world. I have recently watched Floating Weeds for the second time (having ordered it on video). The first time I thought it an unusual film- though not one of his best. I have now completely revised this opinion and consider it a supreme masterpiece. Ozu astonishes with a quiet directness I find moving , completely absorbing and exhilarating to watch. I realize the theatre troup which comes into the town, contstructs its little Kabuki world and then fades into nothing is a perfect vehicle and symbol for what Ozu is consistently portraying in all his little plays: the transient , troubling beauty of the world . The transient troubling little dramas af human relationships.The imagery in all Ozu's films(but somehow epsecially this one) make me see images as I did in childhood : a turned corner on a side street, a scene of a harbor at dusk, a slightly surprised look on the face of middle-aged woman. Many of these movies were filmed when I was a child but I believe there is more than a kind odd 1950's familiarity. There is a kind of direct , unfettered appeal to sensations it is almost difficult to name. Something immediatelyinnocent and guileless  in ourselves. Something always,already seeing and awake. The more I watch Ozu the more I see this and nowhere more than in this film. I kept chuckling at little, scene after little scene. Tiny little nuanced moments I kept rewinding to see if I'd really seen . Anyone who hasn't seen this film: Don't just watch it once.",5,"The Quiet, Usual Ozu Masterpiece",1058400000,"07 17, 2003",2003,1593,"['have', 'only', 'really', 'discovered', 'Ozu', 'last', 'year', 'so', 'mid', 'life', 'entering', 'bright', 'new', 'world', 'have', 'recently', 'watched', 'Floating', 'Weeds', 'second', 'time', 'having', 'ordered', 'video', 'first', 'time', 'thought', 'unusual', 'film-', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'now', 'completely', 'revised', 'opinion', 'consider', 'supreme', 'masterpiece', 'astonishes', 'quiet', 'directness', 'find', 'moving', 'completely', 'absorbing', 'exhilarating', 'watch', 'realize', 'theatre', 'troup', 'town', 'little', 'Kabuki', 'world', 'then', 'nothing', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'symbol', 'what', 'Ozu', 'consistently', 'portraying', 'little', 'plays', 'transient', 'troubling', 'beauty', 'world', 'transient', 'troubling', 'little', 'dramas', 'af', 'human', 'relationships.The', 'imagery', 'Ozu', 'films', 'somehow', 'epsecially', 'one', 'make', 'see', 'images', 'did', 'childhood', 'turned', 'corner', 'side', 'street', 'scene', 'harbor', 'dusk', 'slightly', 'surprised', 'look', 'face', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'Many', 'movies', 'were', 'filmed', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'believe', 'more', 'kind', 'odd', '1950', 'familiarity', 'kind', 'direct', 'unfettered', 'appeal', 'sensations', 'almost', 'difficult', 'name', 'Something', 'immediatelyinnocent', 'guileless', 'ourselves', 'Something', 'always', 'already', 'seeing', 'awake', 'more', 'watch', 'more', 'see', 'nowhere', 'more', 'film', 'kept', 'chuckling', 'little', 'scene', 'little', 'scene', 'Tiny', 'little', 'nuanced', 'moments', 'kept', 'rewinding', 'see', ""'d"", 'really', 'seen', 'Anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'just', 'watch', 'once']",Floating Weeds VHS
348398,A1C5XOPT8DOEFJ,6302969670,Rajesh Balkrishnan,"[2, 6]","Yasujiro Ozu is unarguably one of the greatest directors of this world.  This is a late Ozu piece, and it is somewhat disappointing. A story of a travelling company theater actor who returns to a village where he has left  behind an illegitimate son, is the central theme in this piece. Although  superbly acted, and beautifully shot, the direction (surprisingly), with  the editing takes a few stumbles, and the end product is somewhat  half-baked, and does not stir you as much as the classic Ozu pieces. I am  glad that Ozu left us with the beautiful &quot;Autumn Afternoon&quot;, made  3 years after this film, a dazzling return to form, and a sublime swan  song. Nevertheless, for all you die-hard Ozu fans, &quot;Floating  Weeds&quot; will be a welcome addition to your collection.",4,"A small disappointment, nevertheless a must for Ozu fans",952992000,"03 14, 2000",2000,787,"['Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'unarguably', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'world', 'late', 'Ozu', 'piece', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'story', 'travelling', 'company', 'theater', 'actor', 'who', 'village', 'where', 'left', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'central', 'theme', 'piece', 'superbly', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'direction', 'surprisingly', 'editing', 'few', 'stumbles', 'end', 'product', 'somewhat', 'half-baked', 'not', 'stir', 'as', 'much', 'classic', 'Ozu', 'pieces', 'am', 'glad', 'Ozu', 'left', 'beautiful', 'quot', 'Autumn', 'Afternoon', 'quot', 'made', '3', 'years', 'film', 'dazzling', 'return', 'form', 'sublime', 'swan', 'song', 'Nevertheless', 'die-hard', 'Ozu', 'fans', 'quot', 'Floating', 'Weeds', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'welcome', 'addition', 'collection']",Floating Weeds VHS
