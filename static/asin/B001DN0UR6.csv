1182273,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B001DN0UR6,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[10, 10]","I have been watching anime for a long time (since the late 80s).  This series rates about a 3.5 in my humble opinion.  Here is why:The series itself brings an interesting concept.  The planet that has 180 days of day followed by 180 days of night is pretty interesting (despite the reality of a serious greenhouse effect were this to really exist).  The show is very well animated and well voiced.  I also enjoyed some of the references to ancient Norse mythology, both in the storyline and in the names of the characters and places.Where the series disappointed was in the pace.  11 episodes were far too few to properly develop this complex world and society.  At times the series seemed to move at a pretty even pace, then suddenly rush forward. I thought the passage of time between episode 5 and 6 (or was it 6 and 7) was very well done though.Several characters are introduced, seem to be an important part of the series, then are 'offed' in the same or next episode. Only a few of the characters stuck around and made a serious impact in the series (trying to not include spoilers).  A lot of plot threads are left unfinished.  The final episode seems rather rushed and unsatisfying.  The final 'villain' is a huge disappointment as well...I would definitely recommend this to a die hard sci-fi anime fan; but for those seeking a deeper plot and richer story go for Wolf's Rain ~ a similar yet much better series in my opinion. (based not on the setting but on the overall type of story).Perhaps it would be worth renting from Netflix (which I did) since it is only 2 discs.  Though entertaining, I doubt I would watch it a second time.",3,"Interesting concept, sub-par execution:",1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,1643,"['have', 'been', 'watching', 'anime', 'long', 'time', 'late', '80s', 'series', 'rates', '3.5', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Here', 'why', 'series', 'interesting', 'concept', 'planet', '180', 'days', 'day', 'followed', '180', 'days', 'night', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'reality', 'serious', 'greenhouse', 'effect', 'were', 'really', 'exist', 'show', 'very', 'well', 'animated', 'well', 'voiced', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'references', 'ancient', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'storyline', 'names', 'characters', 'places.Where', 'series', 'disappointed', 'was', 'pace', '11', 'episodes', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'few', 'properly', 'develop', 'complex', 'world', 'society', 'times', 'series', 'seemed', 'move', 'pretty', 'even', 'pace', 'then', 'suddenly', 'forward', 'thought', 'passage', 'time', '5', '6', 'was', '6', '7', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'though.Several', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'seem', 'be', 'important', 'part', 'series', 'then', 'are', ""'offed"", 'same', 'next', 'episode', 'Only', 'few', 'characters', 'stuck', 'made', 'serious', 'impact', 'series', 'trying', 'not', 'include', 'spoilers', 'lot', 'plot', 'threads', 'are', 'left', 'unfinished', 'final', 'episode', 'rather', 'rushed', 'unsatisfying', 'final', ""'villain"", 'huge', 'disappointment', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'die', 'hard', 'sci-fi', 'anime', 'fan', 'seeking', 'deeper', 'plot', 'richer', 'story', 'go', 'Wolf', 'Rain', '~', 'similar', 'yet', 'much', 'better', 'series', 'opinion', 'based', 'not', 'setting', 'overall', 'type', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'renting', 'Netflix', 'did', 'only', '2', 'discs', 'entertaining', 'doubt', 'would', 'watch', 'second', 'time']",Jyu-Oh-Sei: Planet of the Beast King - The Complete Series S.A.V.E.
1182274,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B001DN0UR6,Coulter Rail,"[1, 2]","S.A.V.E. is notorious for housing some regrettable titles that are either infested with animation gimmicks or that aren't received well enough by the masses to reap a solid following (consistent cash spending). Jyu-Oh-Sei is one of the gems that slipped past the anime crowds, ended up on S.A.V.E., and is a great buy/viewing experience.Jyu-Oh-Sei is solid story that's intriguing and taut (no fat). There are no characters staring off at lotus blossoms to force depth where none exists, no side philosophies that muddle the narrative, and no redundant themes unless they are core to the story. Planet of the Beast King feels like a 26-episode series cut down to 11, but successfully. What made this work so well, and yet why couldn't it achieve five stars? Let's get to it:***PROS***PACINGAs stated above, this is a trimmed storyline that doesn't waste the time given to it. After establishing an alien world, the narrative time-jumps with the understanding that, although turbulent years have passed, nothing crucial to the story occurred in the interim. I would have liked to see more of those intervening years, but they didn't get a long show. I applaud them for not wandering aimlessly or just ending halfway through the story with a sign at the end saying, ""Congratulations. Thanks for playing. Presented by Capcom. Buy the Manga.""STORYDon't be confused by the pagan mythos infused into the names on this show. (The main character's name is Thor; there's a doctor called Loki.) There are small similarities, but they don't rely heavily on mythology or derive much from it. Thor and his brother live on a space station, find their parents killed, and are banished to a hostile planet ruled by plant life and packed full of unwanted humanity.  Survival becomes paramount, and Thor vows to find the answers surrounding his banishment. The storyline takes us from survival to death duels for leadership, internal politics, love triangles, and eventually to the long-awaited answers to Thor's banishment. While the love triangle may seem absurd to most, it's actually a well-structured Shakespearean lovers' quarrel: Mistaken identities, changing perspectives, and devious half-truths corrupt the main characters and destroy their emotional egos, sending them into chaos. When you come across that chapter, try to view it from a classic theatrical perspective. The scenes and events can then carry a tasteful gravity.***CONS***These are less about complaints and more an explanation of why this series didn't earn five stars.CHARACTERSThor and the rest of the cast are original when compared to most anime out there, but not in the context of storytelling as a whole. They fit tightly into place and tell the story well, but this anime could have had a powerful effect (like Berserk) if the creators had deepened their characters a little more.MUSICOpening title music means little to the actual execution of a series, but I've come to realize that in the anime world, strong emphasis is placed on the opening number. This show's musical theme is a joke. The opening piece sounds like an early Back Street Boys track and has no place in the mood of the series. I took the show less seriously every time I heard it. The overall soundtrack is adequate, but a broader, bolder theme could have amplified many scenes and carried them to epicness.It's a shame that a couple of extra episodes to add meat to the storyline, deeper characters, and a sweeping score are all that keep this series from being a five-star experience. Still, it's a solid story, credible anime, and cheap success. Enjoy.I'm a writer and animator, so I'm always digging through stacks of anime, looking for gems and sources of inspiration. I'll be writing many more reviews. If this was helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along.

Even though it's over far to soon it covers a lot of ground in the 11 episodes. Seeing as how it's a short series you hit the ground running so to speak. While the story moves forward there are flash backs but none of which take to much time. They have done an excellent job with filling you in along the way.How ever between episode 5 & 6 there is about a 3 year gap. At the end of one episode he is about 12 then the next episode he is going on 16. Yet it blends smoothly and does not leave you with that feeling of ""Huh..what just happened?""This series is well worth your time...It is something that I would recommend and I do not just like anything...I enjoyed Trinity Blood - Black Blood Brothers..Hellsing...Death Note...etc. This hovers right at my top ten and if you liked any of the aforementioned then you should enjoy this.

Perhaps I enjoyed the series so much because I wasn't expecting much, but enjoy it I did. In fact, I watched the whole thing in one sitting because I couldn't tear myself away. (The last short series I felt compelled to watch in one sitting was Paranoia Agent, way back, so that's a compliment to Jyu Oh Sei.)Although it's not 100% perfect (I'd give it 4 and a half stars, to be exact), it's one of the better dramatic sci-fi anime series I've seen in the past couple of years. The story is engrossing, the animation is pretty, and the music, by Hajime Mizoguchi (who also did Jin-Roh, among other things) is a step up from the norm--mostly low-key piano with jazz inflections. The bishounen in it aren't bad either. :DTrashcanman pretty much did a sum up of the story, so I won't repeat that. But I second his assessment. I would just add that I had a slight problem with the ending. However, IMO, endings in anime are typically problematic anyways ... few are perfect.

Chimera is a harsh planet where only the strongest can survive. There is a rumor that he who can defeat all of the clan leaders is able to return to the colony. In order to solve the mystery of their parents' deaths and to get revenge, one of them must become the Beast King.When I first found this series, I was so excited. I am not sure why, but the plot reminded me strongly of Heinlein, one of my favorite science fiction authors. And I was just eager to watch a sci-fi anime that didn't involve mecha (really!).I thought the plot sounded interesting, and with only 11 episodes, I thought it would be sufficiently fast paced. And for the first 5 or so episodes, I was in heaven. Thor was pretty impressive for a 11-year old boy and the world of Chimera unlike anything I had seen in anime. Then episode 6 hit. We get a necessary jump in time (no one could become Beast King in anything less than a few years), which wouldn't have bothered me except the change it wrought in Thor. He goes from being frightened boy determined to survive at all costs (someone to be admired and pitied) to a stereotypical anime teenage boy worthy of a high school drama. Not only does he become both boring and pathetic, he also sort of falls in love and that is even more boring. The plot shifts from survival to unrequited lus- love. It pretty much ruined the whole show for me. The ending wasn't all that bad, but nothing stellar.I probably would have enjoyed this more if I had had lower expectations. When I first finished watching the series I rated it one star, but while writing this review and looking back on it, it really deserves better than that.

1182284,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B001DN0UR6,trashcanman,"[43, 43]","How is it that this show isn't better known?  ""Jyu-Oh-Sei"" is an 11 episode series that manages to stomp nearly every full-length sci-fi anime series out there in spite of it's briefness.  At the end, it seems impossible that such an epic and perfectly-paced storyline could be over so quickly and leave such a large impression.  That is a true testament to the writer and the director of this series.  Guaranteed to thrill any sci-fi fanatic.The story begins as a simple revenge tale.  It takes place in a human colony in the Balkan star system hundreds of years in the future.  Our hero Thor and his twin brother Rai (both 11 years old at the start) are mysteriously kidnapped after discovering that their parents have been murdered. They are dropped off on the planet Chimera, which is a world used by the colonists for capital punishment. The worst criminals are abandoned there and are either soon dead or wish they were.  The planet is as harsh as they come; monstrous plants are the top of the food chain and a single day and night cycle takes an entire year.  Half of the year, the plants flourish and the planet is one massive carnivorous jungle and the other half is complete darkness and Siberian weather.  Great setup.Thor soon learns just how harsh Chimera is.  It is kill or be killed; but he soon finds that he has an uncanny knack for survival.  He also finds that there is civilization on this harshest of planets.  The people of Chimera are a tribal lot broken up by skin color into a series of clans known as Rings.  Each ring is lead by a Top, a Second, and a Third with the Top position being decided by single combat within each Ring.  If a Ring's Top is able to defeat each of the other Rings, he becomes the Beast King and is able to return to the colony.  In other words, if Thor wishes to return home, solve the mystery of his parent's death, and exact his revenge he has his work cut out for him.""Jyu-Oh-Sei"" would already be an outstanding series based on premise alone.  The planet is so intriguing a setting and the characters so strong that it could have cruised almost indefinitely without losing the viewer's interest.  But the story flies by with amazing velocity, even jumping several years ahead at one point. It's got places to go and people to see, that's for sure and not one minute is wasted.  The show is merciless and unpredictable -which it displays very early on- and filled with twists and turns of the best kind.  Even though a savvy viewer will likely soon suspect which character is pulling the strings, the purpose remains an unsolvable mystery until the final episodes which feel like an all-out mental assault on the viewer as bombshell after bombshell hits. The final act is absolutely amazing and jam-packed with pure genius.  It's extremely easy to lose track of the mysteries altogether as you become wrapped up in the intrigue, romance, and drama of the story, which makes the effect of the barrage of revelations even more shocking.  Without any major spoilers, I'll just hint that perhaps the world where mankind's forsaken are sent may in fact be their only hope for survival.  Like I said, epic.While the price of this set is pretty exorbinant considering the small number of episodes, it's well worth it if you've got the bucks.  This is a top-flight work of science fiction that should enthrall both anime newcomers and veterans who've seen it all.  There is no weak link in this series; every aspect seems to have achieved near-perfection.  I was legitimately sad to see it end; but that feeling may have been partly because of the cheap shot near the end that seems to have no purpose other than to break the viewer's heart.

Sometimes short anime's don't do the series justice, but this was an exception.  The series was set in a landscape that was pretty, but deadly.  It was basically kill or be killed.  Survival was the main goal on this planet and friends were few in between.  Even when some of the characters thought they had friends, the truth came forward and they were basically betrayed.
