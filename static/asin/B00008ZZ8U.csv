750992,AOQLO5AHYBNZL,B00008ZZ8U,AnimalLuVer,"[3, 6]","""HIS SECRET LIFE"" is a well directed, good story.  You already know what it's about, so I will tell you that I liked the way the characters are portrayed.  The people seem real and the theme isn't heavy-handed at all.An all-around enjoyable movie, I wanted to call ""His Secret Life"" the best gay movie ever, but I already said that about ""Come Undone"".  Also, this is broader than a gay movie by any comparison.  (If you have any doubt, watch this and then see the sex scenes in ""Come Undone"" and you'll agree that ""His Secret Life"" is far more appealing to people who are not gay.  Tell ya what, if you wanna lock yourself up with a couple great movies then that is the pair.This very good film, ""His Secret Life"", is everything that another one I saw is not:  ""Steam: The Turkish Bath"" is a very bad knockoff of ""HSL"".  Rather than waste good time and money on that one, SEE ""HIS SECRET LIFE"" TWICE -- and also see the NEXT flick, below:IF YOU LIKE ""HSL"", THEN YOU WILL  L-O-V-E ""Making Love"", Starring Michael Ontkean, Harry Hamlin and Kate Jackson, 3 fine actors who put in some of their best work here.  The music is also excellent, by that I mean the title song, ""Making Love (There's more to love, than making love)"".  It reads just like 2005, though it was released in 1982.  It oughtta be on DVD by now, but it's still VHS, and is available from Amazon.Why are you still reading?  Go watch the movie already.

A woman loses her husband in a car accident. She soon discovers her husband had a lover. She is more shocked to find that the lover was a man. At first angry and resentful, Antonia soon replaces her husband in his circle of friends. In so doing, she discovers he had a completely separate life which had nothing to do with hers. His friends know more about him than she did. The only person who doesn't welcome her with open arms, however, is her husband's lover, who feels as if she is trying to replace her husband with his group of quirky friends.There is a sense of competition and jealousy between the two people who loved the dead man most. The jealousy and resentment only increases when Antonia is accepted into the fold of her husband's friends. The characters of the friends are fascinating. Many of them are Turkish immigrants, some are straight, some are gay, and one marvelous character is trans-gender. One of the young Turkish men even falls for the older Antonia. The end is a bit too tidy and stretches the limits of how to end a film in a tidy manner.

Antonia is happily married to a handsome Italian man (Massimo) who dies suddenly in an accident, leaving her bereft and lonely.  Massimo's friends at work bring Antonia his belongings and in opening the office clutter she discovers a painting (""The Ignorant Fairy"") which has an inscription on the back that it is from a lover of seven years.  Antonia is convinced that her husband has had another woman and sets out to confront her, only to discover that the lover was a man (Michele) who lives in a wholly gay household with a devoted 'extended family'.  At first taken aback, Antonia learns about her husband's bisexuality, becomes part of this extended family and indeed is a very important member as she is the one selected to administer the AIDS IVs to one of the family memebers.  Gradually Antonia and Michele grow to understand each other as each related to the common love for Massimo.  The ending is too beautiful to destroy by a review.  See this film and grow.All of the actors are richly gifed and the photography, settings, dialogue, and general message are so strong that this movie should be seen by a very wide audience, perhaps helping to relsove misunderstandings about many aspects of gender identities.

To put it mildly, this is a shock to Antonia who nonetheless finds herself welcomed into Michele's coterie of friends: some societal misfits, most not.It is in this company that Antonia realizes that Massimo had much more than an affair; he had an entirely different life with a whole circle of other friends.It is to the director, Ferzen Ozpetek's credit that this film becomes, not a film of revenge or hate but one of understanding and acceptance. Antonia, unlike the Vera Miles character in ""Back Street"" who does everything she can to make her husband's mistress Rae (Susan Hayward) miserable, learns to care for Michele and his friends. Antonia's mother, obviously a very wise woman and speaking for the writer I would think, says and I'm paraphrasing here: ""It is always the mistress who suffers the most, she is the one who must spend holidays alone, she is the one who must wait for the phone to ring, she is the one who must accept her lover's limitations or live without him.""If Ozpetek makes any miss-steps here it is that some of the scenes are directed with a TV soap opera seriousness that smudges the earnest caring and thoughtfulness of his mise en scene.Marguerita Buy does an outstanding job as Antonia: fearful, regretful, scared, repulsed, angered yet ultimately accepting and loving. Stefano Accorsi's Michele is a nice guy who finds himself in an untenable situation: he wants to strike out at Antonia (he does at times) but he also realizes her loss is greater then his and he respects this. Accorsi tempers Michele's pain with remorse and guilt and thereby creates a multi-layered, rather than one-dimensional character. Accorsi and Buy imbue their characters with a sort of damaged nobility that strikes a cord in our hearts and in our minds.""Le Fate Ignoranti"" is in many ways a ""pot-boiler"" harkening back to some of the films of the American 50's and 60's but it's head and heart is firmly rooted in the new millennium.
