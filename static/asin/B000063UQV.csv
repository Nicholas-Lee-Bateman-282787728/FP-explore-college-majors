695977,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,B000063UQV,David Bonesteel,"[0, 0]","The second installment of the long-running Japanese samurai series does not disappoint.  When Zatoichi (Shintaro Katsu) discovers that a powerful lord is insane, the lord's retainers decide to kill him for fear of the consequences should he reveal the fact.  As Ichi says later, all they had to do was ask him to keep it quiet and he would have.  However, dishonorable men expect only dishonorable behavior from everyone, so they see murder as the only solution.  At the same time, a foe from Zatoichi's past appears to complicate matters.This movie has more going for it than just great action, although it certainly has plenty of that.  Zatoichi is a genuinely likeable character and the climactic battle has some real emotional heft to it.",4,A strong sequel,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,742,"['second', 'installment', 'long-running', 'Japanese', 'samurai', 'series', 'not', 'disappoint', 'When', 'Zatoichi', 'Shintaro', 'Katsu', 'powerful', 'lord', 'insane', 'lord', 'retainers', 'decide', 'kill', 'fear', 'consequences', 'should', 'reveal', 'fact', 'Ichi', 'later', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'ask', 'keep', 'quiet', 'would', 'have', 'However', 'dishonorable', 'men', 'expect', 'only', 'dishonorable', 'behavior', 'everyone', 'see', 'murder', 'only', 'solution', 'same', 'time', 'foe', 'Zatoichi', 'past', 'complicate', 'matters.This', 'movie', 'more', 'going', 'just', 'great', 'action', 'certainly', 'plenty', 'Zatoichi', 'genuinely', 'likeable', 'character', 'climactic', 'battle', 'real', 'emotional', 'heft']","Zatoichi the Blind Swordsman, Vol. 2 - The Tale of Zatoichi Continues"

And like the first episode, we find the protagonist Zatoichi [Shintaro Katsu] returning to the scene of the first episode. Ichi has come to pay his respects to the Ronin, Hirate, whom Ichi did not wish to kill. Ichi's brother, Yoshiro, [Tomisaburo Wakayama] in both the film, and in true life, is in the episode. And as usual he is larger than life. The film starts off with the usual Ichi trademark of humor, which will become more pronounced as the episodes continue.Yoshiro, the one-armed samurai is his brother: and his brother has a grudge with Ichi. At the same time, Yoshiro and his sidekick must elude the law, which have a bounty on his head.Throughout the film Zatoichi gives off the nuances of humor which he will make a trademark of in regards to the character. As the episode begins, Ichi is asked to give a massage to the Lord to Edo, however, he discovers that the lord is a lunatic. The court retainers wish to keep this a secret, therefore, they attempt to kill Ichi because he has heard the antics of the Lord while giving him a massage. They don't yet realize who they are up against.Zatoichi's reputation has not been cemented yet in this early installment, moreover, the action scenes in the second episode are limited in the beginning. Not so with the ending however, and as the film nears the end Zatoichi has begun to cement his reputation as a swordsman to be reckoned with. The cinematography is very good, and they will only get better as the Zatoichi saga continues. I do not wish to spoil the ending for you, but if you hang in there with the plot, you will see the beginnig stages of this magnificent swordsman.

Its extremely hard to transfer older movies like this to DVD because of the picture quality on the originals.... They did an awesome awesome job! The movie on top of that is just plain amazing as well.If your looking at the review and wondering what Zatoichi is?Well these are genre films. Very well put together with quality acting and wonderful cinematography for its time. The way that Shintaro Katsu can create a character is beyond the capabilities of 99% of the actors today.

If you have not seen the first episode let me catch you up.  Zatoichi came into town and was unsuccessfully hired to help take out a rival gang in town.  One side had already hired a master samurai.  When that samurai became sick the other gang thought they weren't going to fight.  But he shook off his sickness for a final heroic stand and helped the gang he was hired from beat out the other one even though they were outnumbered by double the swordsman.  But then the samurai decided that he must face Zatoichi before he dies.  ""Better than dying at teh hands of goons"".  I am horrible at quotes but it was something like that.  And then the table were turned and the gang that had more men ended up winning.  Also from thsi Zatoichi became known as like a one man army.Well in this one he is back in town one year later to visit the grave and pay his respects to this samurai.  The story starts out almost a bit dumb but you forgtet it and it turns good minutes in when Ichi starts some sh** talking and though justified, he may have gone too far.  Well these people are not happy and decide to try and kill him.  What follows is a VERY good story about another samurai who we find all about.  Ichi ends up meeting this ""samurai"" and we find out the connection between the 2.  The whole movie I was deciding whether or not this should be a 4 or a 5, but then the end happened.  You don't f*** with Zaoichi or anybody who is close too him.The DVD is amazing picture quality, even though it is in black and white.  Also perfectly letterboxed and some of the best subtitles you will ever see traslated for asian cinema.",5,Katsu's real life brother(Lone Wolf and Cub) plays his foe,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,1710,"['So', 'obviously', 'acting', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'story', 'thing', 'watch', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'first', 'episode', 'let', 'catch', 'up', 'Zatoichi', 'came', 'town', 'was', 'unsuccessfully', 'hired', 'help', 'take', 'out', 'rival', 'gang', 'town', 'One', 'side', 'had', 'already', 'hired', 'master', 'samurai', 'When', 'samurai', 'became', 'sick', 'other', 'gang', 'thought', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'fight', 'shook', 'off', 'sickness', 'final', 'heroic', 'stand', 'helped', 'gang', 'was', 'hired', 'beat', 'other', 'one', 'even', 'were', 'outnumbered', 'double', 'swordsman', 'then', 'samurai', 'decided', 'must', 'face', 'Zatoichi', 'Better', 'dying', 'teh', 'hands', 'goons', 'am', 'horrible', 'quotes', 'was', 'something', 'then', 'table', 'were', 'turned', 'gang', 'had', 'more', 'men', 'ended', 'up', 'winning', 'Also', 'thsi', 'Zatoichi', 'became', 'known', 'one', 'man', 'army.Well', 'one', 'back', 'town', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'visit', 'grave', 'pay', 'respects', 'samurai', 'story', 'out', 'almost', 'bit', 'dumb', 'forgtet', 'good', 'minutes', 'when', 'Ichi', 'sh**', 'talking', 'justified', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'Well', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'decide', 'try', 'kill', 'What', 'VERY', 'good', 'story', 'samurai', 'who', 'find', 'Ichi', 'up', 'meeting', 'samurai', 'find', 'out', 'connection', '2', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'deciding', 'not', 'should', 'be', '4', '5', 'then', 'end', 'happened', 'do', ""n't"", 'f***', 'Zaoichi', 'anybody', 'who', 'close', 'too', 'him.The', 'DVD', 'amazing', 'picture', 'quality', 'even', 'black', 'white', 'Also', 'perfectly', 'letterboxed', 'best', 'subtitles', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'traslated', 'asian', 'cinema']","Zatoichi the Blind Swordsman, Vol. 2 - The Tale of Zatoichi Continues"

Features revved up action, a lethal love triangle and a freaky one-armed samurai.

Zatoichi manages to escape until he is forced to confront his old foe -- the one armed warrior (played by Kenzaburo, Shintaro Katsu's brother who changed his name to Tomisaburo Wakayama and starred as Itto Ogami in the ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" series).This is a great series that has been hotly desired by an eclectic group of samurai videophiles who call themselves ""Ichi Freaks.""

In this film, which takes place a year after the first one, Ichi is returning to the town where he had killed his friend, Hirate Miki (as shown in the first film). He wishes to pay respect to Hirate.As it turns out, in this film, it seems that everyone and his brother (literally, as we'll see) ends up after Ichi. At first, we see Ichi in his profession as a blind masseur. He is giving a massage to the local daimyo. The daimyo reveals during the massage that he is quite insane. The retainers decide that they must kill Ichi in order to prevent the world from knowing that their lord is insane -- if this knowledge were to get out, the Shogunate might abolish the clan. Then there are the local yakuza who also want to go after Ichi. And then a mysterious one-armed warrior, who it turns out, is Ichi's brother in disguise as a ronin (both Ichi and his brother were born as commoners). Ichi resents his brother because earlier, Ichi's fiancee left him for his brother when Ichi was revealed as becoming blind. In feudal Japan (as well as in feudal Europe and other places) being blind automatically consigned the person into a ""non-human"" state, usually condemning a blind person into the caste of begging and similar occupations.There are some conflicting stories about how and when Ichi became blind. In this film version, Ichi became blind as a young adult. In the TV series, Ichi became blind as a child.The subplots are too complex to sum up here. Suffice it that there is a final conflict between Ichi and his brother. Needless to say, Ichi is still alive though his brother is not.
