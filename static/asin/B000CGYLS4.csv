958841,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000CGYLS4,Brian E. Erland,"[2, 2]","Note: Hindi with English subtitles.'Karan Arjun' released in '95 is a wonderfully entertaining 151 minute mixture of action, comedy and romance starring a cast of some of India's biggest stars; Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan (not related), Amrish Puri, Kajol and Rakhee Gulzer. This is by no means a big budget Bollywood production so some of the action scenes are shall we say a little cheezy, but the acting is excellent and you'll soon find yourself so absorbed in the storyline that you won't notice the shortcomings.Synopsis: The film begins with the brutal murder of two brothers, Karan (Salman) and Arjun (Shah Rukh) by their dispicable Uncle Thakur (Puri) who desires the family fortune for himself. After their deaths their Mother Durga (Rakhee Gulzar) pleads to the Goddess Kali to return her sons to her alive and well. Kali answers her prayer through the vehicle of reincarnation and when the two reborn brothers return to the village twenty years later revenge is not far behind.'Karan Arjun' offers great entertainment, high caliber cast, intriquing plot and a fascinating look at the most feared and misunderstood deity in the Hindu pantheon, Kali.",4,"""We Have Been Reborn ~ The Weapons Of A Mother""",1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,1160,"['Note', 'Hindi', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Arjun', 'released', ""'95"", 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', '151', 'minute', 'mixture', 'action', 'comedy', 'romance', 'starring', 'cast', 'India', 'biggest', 'stars', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'not', 'related', 'Amrish', 'Puri', 'Kajol', 'Rakhee', 'Gulzer', 'means', 'big', 'budget', 'Bollywood', 'production', 'so', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'shall', 'say', 'little', 'cheezy', 'acting', 'excellent', ""'ll"", 'soon', 'find', 'so', 'absorbed', 'storyline', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'shortcomings.Synopsis', 'film', 'brutal', 'murder', 'two', 'brothers', 'Karan', 'Salman', 'Arjun', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'dispicable', 'Uncle', 'Thakur', 'Puri', 'who', 'family', 'fortune', 'deaths', 'Mother', 'Durga', 'Rakhee', 'Gulzar', 'Goddess', 'Kali', 'return', 'sons', 'alive', 'well', 'Kali', 'prayer', 'vehicle', 'reincarnation', 'when', 'two', 'reborn', 'brothers', 'return', 'village', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'revenge', 'not', 'far', 'Arjun', 'offers', 'great', 'entertainment', 'high', 'caliber', 'cast', 'intriquing', 'plot', 'fascinating', 'look', 'most', 'feared', 'misunderstood', 'deity', 'Hindu', 'pantheon', 'Kali']",N/A
958842,A36VA0K8NVUXQD,B000CGYLS4,D. C. Sterling,"[3, 7]","I usually love Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, but this was a terrible movie. I thought Salman fared better in it than Shah Rukh did. I really liked the two female costars, one of which was Kajol and I don't know the other one's name, but she was Salman's romantic interest. To me, she was the star of the show--what an incredible dancer! This movie is full of violence and blood. In almost every scene with the boys' mother, she was being beaten up and I got used to seeing her with blood on her head all the time. Even children were being beaten and killed. The only good thing in this movie was the dancing--that was it. The dancing was very traditional and very entertaining. But the movie itself? Awful, awful, awful. I give this movie one star for the dancing only.",1,"Awful movie, very bloody and violent",1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,771,"['usually', 'love', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'was', 'terrible', 'movie', 'thought', 'Salman', 'fared', 'better', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'did', 'really', 'liked', 'two', 'female', 'costars', 'one', 'was', 'Kajol', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'one', 'name', 'was', 'Salman', 'romantic', 'interest', 'was', 'star', 'show', 'what', 'incredible', 'dancer', 'movie', 'full', 'violence', 'blood', 'almost', 'scene', 'boys', 'mother', 'was', 'being', 'beaten', 'up', 'got', 'used', 'seeing', 'blood', 'head', 'time', 'Even', 'children', 'were', 'being', 'beaten', 'killed', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'dancing', 'was', 'dancing', 'was', 'very', 'traditional', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Awful', 'awful', 'awful', 'give', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'dancing', 'only']",N/A
958843,AZEBQGWRW9GHC,B000CGYLS4,Delta,"[1, 2]","So I ordered this film in the hopes of being able to see and compare SK and SRK  acting/dancing/character development in the early stages.  So far, I have not been a fan of SRK and after this movie I still am not. I can see why SK was nominated for awards for his portrayal as Karan. When put side by side - I think it's apparent that SK has &#34; it-ness.&#34;  Clearly SK is a better dancer and projects believe-ability in this and other roles. Aside from the quality of the copy which wasn't that great the movie itself was enjoyable. The plot and the theme worked well; the music was adequate nothing that you would hum later - but the dance sequences were fun. Other reviewers have mentioned the violence - there is a lot of fighting - but the sequences are laughable.  I found myself laughing more at the the continuity issues of the fight scenes than the scenes themselves.  There is sword play - but in the context of all the fight scenes they are not done that well.  The &#34; western &#34; attire in the film was right out of  &#34; Saturday Night Fever &#34; which - was on target for the time of the film... For me the best part of the movie were the villagers.  Loved them - they were supportive, caring, and involved in cleaning up the mess and bringing retribution to the &#34; Landlord &#34;.  I was a bit uneasy about the Mother/Sons relationship in the beginning of the movie - it almost seemed  &#34; oedipus-like&#34; - but as the movie proceeded it explained the mother's intensity and faith and her request to Kali to have her sons re-born and brought back to her.  Ok , that whole scene was kinda cheesy - but it worked.  So, if you're looking to add to your Hindi movie archive and you're a fan of SK and/or SRK - this movie will do.  I've given it a 4 because SK was in it or it would have been a 3.",4,Well,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,1825,"['So', 'ordered', 'film', 'hopes', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'compare', 'SK', 'SRK', 'acting/dancing/character', 'development', 'early', 'stages', 'So', 'far', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'fan', 'SRK', 'movie', 'still', 'am', 'not', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'SK', 'was', 'nominated', 'awards', 'portrayal', 'Karan', 'When', 'put', 'side', 'side', 'think', 'apparent', 'SK', '34', 'it-ness.', '34', 'Clearly', 'SK', 'better', 'dancer', 'projects', 'believe-ability', 'other', 'roles', 'Aside', 'quality', 'copy', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'plot', 'theme', 'worked', 'well', 'music', 'was', 'adequate', 'nothing', 'would', 'hum', 'later', 'dance', 'sequences', 'were', 'fun', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'violence', 'lot', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'are', 'laughable', 'found', 'laughing', 'more', 'continuity', 'issues', 'fight', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'sword', 'play', 'context', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'well', '34', 'western', '34', 'attire', 'film', 'was', 'right', '34', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', '34', 'was', 'target', 'time', 'film', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'were', 'villagers', 'Loved', 'were', 'supportive', 'caring', 'involved', 'cleaning', 'up', 'mess', 'bringing', 'retribution', '34', 'Landlord', '34', 'was', 'bit', 'uneasy', 'Mother/Sons', 'relationship', 'beginning', 'movie', 'almost', 'seemed', '34', 'oedipus-like', '34', 'movie', 'proceeded', 'explained', 'mother', 'intensity', 'faith', 'request', 'Kali', 'have', 'sons', 're-born', 'brought', 'back', 'Ok', 'whole', 'scene', 'was', 'kinda', 'cheesy', 'worked', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'add', 'Hindi', 'movie', 'archive', ""'re"", 'fan', 'SK', 'and/or', 'SRK', 'movie', 'will', 'do', ""'ve"", 'given', '4', 'SK', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'been', '3']",N/A

His problem was over acting in every bit of the movie, he should learn that less is more sometimes but I think it's inherent in his style of acting. Kajol wasn't too bad except that someone should have told her to lose that mono-brow of hers before filming! The saving grace of this movie was the story line and some dignified and believable acting from the mother, the bad uncle and Salman Khan, thus the 2 star rating. Will I watch it again?

He has so much energy and you can see if loves to act and dance. Salmon was good too. I loved the music. Had to put up with watching the evil mean spirited people around Arjun, Karan and mother.
