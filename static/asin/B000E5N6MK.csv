969046,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000E5N6MK,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[14, 18]","If you love the Steelers' then this is an excellent DVD. If you love the NFL, then I'd also pick this up, and if you're a collector of Super Bowl memorabilia, then obviously this isn't something you'd want to miss. Beyond that, this DVD probably won't appeal to you in any way.With that out of the way, this is a well-produced DVD dedicated solely to the Steelers' 2005 season from their first regular season game to their final Super Bowl victory. And because it was made by the guys at NFL Films, the quality of the camera work and the narration is top notch, and the sound is amazing. You hear the hits you wanted hear during the season. Also contained on this DVD are a few note-worthy extras, including the Game of the Week from the NFL Network ""Steelers at Colts."" This was probably one of the greatest games in playoff history mainly because of all the strange happenings, so it's nice to actually have it contained on this DVD. There are also some wired for sound tracks following some key Steelers players as well as Bill Cowher and the Bus. To add to what I thought was already a heap of extras, there is the half-time show (which was terrible, if you ask me), media day (which is useless, if you ask me), and numerous promos and tv spots to watch.All in all, this is a solid DVD for Steelers' fan and an excellent addition to a dream season. But as I said, few outside of the collector's circle will find anything worth interest here. Personally, I wanted to give this a five, but had to settle with a four (I did the same for the Sports Illustrated book as well).",4,Great for Steelers' Fans,1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,1575,"['love', 'Steelers', 'then', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'love', 'NFL', 'then', ""'d"", 'also', 'pick', 'up', ""'re"", 'collector', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'memorabilia', 'then', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'something', ""'d"", 'want', 'miss', 'Beyond', 'DVD', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'way.With', 'way', 'well-produced', 'DVD', 'dedicated', 'solely', 'Steelers', '2005', 'season', 'first', 'regular', 'season', 'game', 'final', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'victory', 'was', 'made', 'guys', 'NFL', 'Films', 'quality', 'camera', 'work', 'narration', 'top', 'notch', 'sound', 'amazing', 'hear', 'hits', 'wanted', 'hear', 'season', 'Also', 'contained', 'DVD', 'are', 'few', 'note-worthy', 'extras', 'including', 'Game', 'Week', 'NFL', 'Network', 'Steelers', 'Colts', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'greatest', 'games', 'playoff', 'history', 'mainly', 'strange', 'happenings', 'nice', 'actually', 'have', 'contained', 'DVD', 'are', 'also', 'wired', 'sound', 'tracks', 'following', 'key', 'Steelers', 'players', 'as', 'well', 'Bill', 'Cowher', 'Bus', 'add', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'already', 'heap', 'extras', 'half-time', 'show', 'was', 'terrible', 'ask', 'media', 'day', 'useless', 'ask', 'numerous', 'promos', 'tv', 'spots', 'watch.All', 'solid', 'DVD', 'Steelers', 'fan', 'excellent', 'addition', 'dream', 'season', 'said', 'few', 'collector', 'circle', 'will', 'find', 'anything', 'worth', 'interest', 'here', 'Personally', 'wanted', 'give', 'five', 'had', 'settle', 'four', 'did', 'same', 'Sports', 'Illustrated', 'book', 'as', 'well']",NFL Super Bowl XL - Pittsburgh Steelers Championship

969048,A1IL6W1NK05UW9,B000E5N6MK,"C. Baker ""cbaker""","[5, 6]","This Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XL highlight package is very nicely done and should be a real keepsake for Steelers fans.  In fact, it may be the most well done highlights package I've seen among this video series.  It even evoked emotions in this viewer - and I am a New England Patriots fan.  The biggest disappointment in this DVD however, is that the bonus features are awful.  There really is only one good segment and the rest is just terrible.  And, worst of all, unlike the past two years, it does not include the entire Super Bowl game!  Steelers' fans should be quite disappointed with the bonus features given what was included in the last two Super Bowl videos for the New England Patriots.  More on that later.The feature of this DVD is about an hour long highlights reel of the Pittsburgh Steelers 2005 season.  It includes highlights of every regular season and playoff game.  The highlights for the playoffs and Super Bowl are quite extensive.  It closely breaks down the crazy, topsy-turvy Pittsburgh victory over the Indianapolis Colts in the divisional round of the playoffs, which featured a dramatic Jerome Bettis fumble at the end of regulation that could have cost the Steelers the game.  The video also contains sound bites from coaches, players, and from the locker room during the course of the season.Overall this highlights package is very well done.  I especially liked the opening montage showing Pittsburgh Steelers' mistakes and losses in several AFC Championship games (some of which they were heavily favored in) and Super Bowl XXX against Dallas - reminding us just how close this team has come to winning it all the past ten years but fallen just short.  It ends with Hines Ward weeping in front of the camera after last year's loss to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, setting the stage for a season that saw them win it all in tough circumstances.  As noted, special attention is given the Steelers' victory over the Indianapolis Colts in the Divisional Playoff Game, which was quite well done.  I also liked many of the close-up on the field shots that bring that action right into your lap.The drawbacks to the highlights package, to me, is that for individual games often the drama and key important plays are just not quite brought out enough.  I felt they did a better job with the playoff games than the regular season games, at least better than most previous additions.  Also, a lot, maybe too much, attention is given to Jerome Bettis, who really becomes the central focus and story of the video at times.  I am not sure how Steelers fans will feel about this but I thought it might have been a tad overdone at the expense of other players.  And finally, and this should not surprise anyone given this is an NFL product, there was not much talk about the poor officiating in the playoff games, which was a very large part of the overall tenor of this year's post season play and the Super Bowl.  It is unfortunate that officiating was such as issue, but it was, and that this video mostly ignores the issue makes this an incomplete, maybe even inaccurate, historical record.Now for the big letdown, the Bonus Features.  The Bonus Features, frankly, are just not very good.  If I weren't spoiled by the Bonus Features of the past two Super Bowls I probably wouldn't have that much of a reaction to them because they are, after all, add-ons.  But I am spoiled.  It does not contain the entire Super Bowl game and it does not contain post game analysis or interviews.  It mostly contains a lot of tripe.The best, and actually very well done bonus feature, is an even more detailed highlights reel of the Pittsburgh victory over the favored Indianapolis Colts in the playoffs.  It goes through all the drama - to the erroneously overturned interception by Troy Polamalu, Bettis's goal line fumble, and the big choke by kicker Mike Vanderjagt who badly missed a makeable field goal that would have tied the game on the last play or regulation.  It's quite a well done piece.You also get little snippets of video about Bill Cowher, Jerome Bettis, Willie Parker, and Steelers' history that are very short, and frankly not very good.  There are media day player interviews on the DVD, as well as the entire half time show, which for me I could care less about.  And finally there are Super Bowl promo videos.  Who cares about that!!!Despite my disappointment in the Bonus Features, overall I give this video a high recommendation for the highlights reel.  If you look at the Bonus Features as freebies, then it's hard to complain too much about it.  But compared to last year's DVD, some will be disappointed.

969049,A3EO29693XPZV,B000E5N6MK,"D. Ribel ""Die Hard Steeler""","[10, 20]","First of all, When Big Ben was air born there is an angle that shows the tip of the ball crossing the plain. Whinch is the very beginning of the edge of the white chalk. The ball does not have to make it to the green of the endzone or even to the center of the white chalk. Plus, Roethlisberger is 6'5, he was gonna make it on 4th down because he had moved the ball to the half inch line. Small ob's fall over behind center on the same sneak all the time. Cower is recorded saying on the side line that he is gonna go for it.  As well, Jackson pushed off on Chris Hope in the end zone. His wrist was bent, his arm extends and he gains seperation and leverage in order to get to the ball, Hope even leaves his feet from the push. If a defensive back does this same thing for an interception, it's gonna be called interference all day. As far as the hold goes, It's clear that the tackle for Seattle pulls on the top of the shirt of Clark Haggins for a split second and has his fingers closed  the rest of the time. The hands must be opened for them not to call holding. Also, if you watch the play you see that Haggins was not offsides, he moved, which he is allowed to do as a defensive player, before the ball was snapped, but did not cross the line of scrimmage until after th ball was snapped. That's what 3-4 linebackers often do, they antisepate the snap count to gain an advantage, like in a chess match, you antisepate your opponets next move from what you have studied through out, it's called stradagey. It did not help Seattle's  cause that that two holding calls, even more obvious ones, were called on Seahawk linemen against Steelers linebackers earlier in the game. One on Haggins , which Pitt declined due to gaining a sack, and one on Farrior, which was a take down like the one in question I'll give you that the block on Hassleback was an attempt at a tackle, but that was a post possesion foul. Pittsburgh scores on the gaget play on that drive no matter where the start. No one cried when Chris Hope knocked the ball out of Jeramey Stevens possesion after the tight end made a foot ball move and it was obviously a foumble and they called it incomplete and blew the whistle so that Pitt could not recover the ball, or when Ben got blocked in the back during the return on his interception, which happened at the 30 and would have been 15 yds from the spot of the foul so Seattle would have stated that drive grom the 45 and not the sixteen. Anyways, Pittsburgh made the Big Plays and seattle did not, The 37 yarder to Hiens ward on 3rd and 28, the 75 yard run by Parker and the 43 yd gaget paly from Randell Ell to heins Ward. Also, haver driving the ball down Seattle throat on Pitts best drive of the game, If Ben puts a little more air under the 3rda and goal pass attept, it's 21-3 Steelers, so seattle does not get thier only td which was set up on that pick, and Pitt still scores the gaget paly and the final is 28-3 Steelers, a blowout and no one remembers any calls, that were by the way, broken down on NFL Network by thethe Head Ref and stated that ll were text book calls except for the tackle that they called a block. Read the rule book before you complain, you can find it on line. Anyways great teams overcome bad calls even if they do exsist, Pittsburgh got robbed on the overturn of the Polumalo interception against Indy which ended the game at 21-10, and Randell Ell got interfered with so bad int that game on deep route, that even the announcers and halftime show analys were talking about how it could be 21-3 at the half",4,response to A Kids Review,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",2006,3564,"['First', 'all', 'When', 'Big', 'Ben', 'was', 'air', 'angle', 'tip', 'ball', 'crossing', 'plain', 'Whinch', 'very', 'beginning', 'edge', 'white', 'chalk', 'ball', 'not', 'have', 'make', 'green', 'endzone', 'even', 'center', 'white', 'chalk', 'Roethlisberger', '6', '5', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'make', '4th', 'down', 'had', 'moved', 'ball', 'half', 'inch', 'line', 'Small', 'ob', 'fall', 'center', 'same', 'sneak', 'time', 'Cower', 'recorded', 'saying', 'side', 'line', 'gon', 'go', 'As', 'well', 'Jackson', 'pushed', 'off', 'Chris', 'Hope', 'end', 'zone', 'wrist', 'was', 'bent', 'arm', 'extends', 'gains', 'seperation', 'leverage', 'order', 'get', 'ball', 'Hope', 'even', 'feet', 'push', 'defensive', 'back', 'same', 'thing', 'interception', 'gon', 'be', 'called', 'interference', 'day', 'As', 'far', 'hold', 'clear', 'tackle', 'Seattle', 'pulls', 'top', 'shirt', 'Clark', 'Haggins', 'split', 'second', 'fingers', 'closed', 'rest', 'time', 'hands', 'must', 'be', 'opened', 'not', 'call', 'holding', 'Also', 'watch', 'play', 'see', 'Haggins', 'was', 'not', 'offsides', 'moved', 'allowed', 'do', 'defensive', 'player', 'ball', 'was', 'snapped', 'did', 'not', 'cross', 'line', 'scrimmage', 'th', 'ball', 'was', 'snapped', 'what', '3-4', 'linebackers', 'often', 'do', 'antisepate', 'snap', 'count', 'gain', 'advantage', 'chess', 'match', 'antisepate', 'opponets', 'next', 'move', 'what', 'have', 'studied', 'out', 'called', 'stradagey', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'Seattle', 'cause', 'two', 'holding', 'calls', 'even', 'more', 'obvious', 'ones', 'were', 'called', 'Seahawk', 'linemen', 'Steelers', 'linebackers', 'earlier', 'game', 'One', 'Haggins', 'Pitt', 'declined', 'due', 'gaining', 'sack', 'one', 'Farrior', 'was', 'take', 'down', 'one', 'question', ""'ll"", 'give', 'block', 'Hassleback', 'was', 'attempt', 'tackle', 'was', 'post', 'possesion', 'foul', 'Pittsburgh', 'gaget', 'play', 'drive', 'matter', 'where', 'start', 'one', 'cried', 'when', 'Chris', 'Hope', 'knocked', 'ball', 'Jeramey', 'Stevens', 'possesion', 'tight', 'end', 'made', 'foot', 'ball', 'move', 'was', 'obviously', 'foumble', 'called', 'incomplete', 'blew', 'whistle', 'Pitt', 'could', 'not', 'recover', 'ball', 'when', 'Ben', 'got', 'blocked', 'back', 'return', 'interception', 'happened', '30', 'would', 'have', 'been', '15', 'yds', 'spot', 'foul', 'so', 'Seattle', 'would', 'have', 'stated', 'drive', 'grom', '45', 'not', 'sixteen', 'Anyways', 'Pittsburgh', 'made', 'Big', 'Plays', 'seattle', 'did', 'not', '37', 'yarder', 'Hiens', 'ward', '3rd', '28', '75', 'yard', 'run', 'Parker', '43', 'yd', 'gaget', 'paly', 'Randell', 'Ell', 'heins', 'Ward', 'Also', 'haver', 'driving', 'ball', 'down', 'Seattle', 'throat', 'Pitts', 'best', 'drive', 'game', 'Ben', 'little', 'more', 'air', '3rda', 'goal', 'pass', 'attept', '21-3', 'Steelers', 'so', 'seattle', 'not', 'get', 'thier', 'only', 'td', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'pick', 'Pitt', 'still', 'gaget', 'paly', 'final', '28-3', 'Steelers', 'blowout', 'one', 'calls', 'were', 'way', 'broken', 'down', 'NFL', 'Network', 'thethe', 'Head', 'Ref', 'stated', 'll', 'were', 'text', 'book', 'tackle', 'called', 'block', 'Read', 'rule', 'book', 'complain', 'can', 'find', 'line', 'great', 'teams', 'overcome', 'bad', 'calls', 'even', 'do', 'exsist', 'Pittsburgh', 'got', 'robbed', 'overturn', 'Polumalo', 'interception', 'Indy', 'ended', 'game', '21-10', 'Randell', 'Ell', 'got', 'interfered', 'so', 'bad', 'int', 'game', 'deep', 'route', 'even', 'announcers', 'halftime', 'show', 'analys', 'were', 'talking', 'how', 'could', 'be', '21-3', 'half']",NFL Super Bowl XL - Pittsburgh Steelers Championship

Anyone who knows the game or played the game, know that in order to score a touchdown the entire ball has to do is cross the goal line. When Big Ben was in the air the ball was on the goal line and even though he was pushed back. In football, they call that forward progress and that's why the play wasn't over turned. Even if the refs miss a call or two, one call doesn't determine the out come of a football game. The Seattle Seahawks had just as many opportunities to win the game as Pittsburgh. The difference was that the Steelers were able to execute and the Seahawks didn't. You can also add to the fact that Detroit is only 300 miles from Pittsburgh and Seattle is 3000 miles, which made this somewhat a home game for Pittsburgh.

Midway through the season things started to look bleak and in week 14, the Steelers came out of the tunnel at Heinz Field to face the Chicago Bears at 7-5.  Playoff hopes were dim at best.  Could they break the three game losing streak and save their season?  Dark clouds on the horizon...right?The Steelers won their final four games to end the regular season with a record of 11-5 and squeaked into the final playoff berth by the hair on Jerome Bettis' chinny-chin-chin.Take to the road.There was no way a sixth seed Wild Card team could win all three road games to make it to the Super Bowl.  No way in hell! Bill Cowher go to the Big Game?  Don't be ridiculous!Cinncinati Bengals?  The third game played between these two teams would decide who owned the AFC North.  The Bengals lose Carson Palmer on the opening drive thanks to a rollup by Kimo Von Olhoffen.  Jon Kitna comes in strong and the Bengals are up 14-0.  The Steelers are done for....right?  Please.  The wheels fall off The Bungle's bus as as Big Ben & The Bus (along with a little help from Cedric Wilson, Antwaan Randle El, Hines Ward, Heath Miller & so many others) roll over the AFC North Division Champions like narcs at a biker rally.On to Indianapolis.  The Colts are already etched on the Lombardi Trophy for Super Bowl XL.  No contest.  They had already kicked the Steelers asses six weeks before and they were going all the way.  This was their year.  Payton Manning could not be stopped with a 13-0 start. Marvin Harrison was on fire Edgerin James was rolling.  Hell, even the Colts' defense had stepped it up to the nth degree.  The Steelers destruction was assured.  Only one problem....someone forgot to tell the Black & Gold to lay down and die.  The Steelers came out and smashed the favorites in the mouth Pittsburgh style.  Joey Porter and Troy Polamalu owned Payton like a bitch.  Polamalu's key 4th quarter interception was miraculously overturned into an incomplete pass.  Jerome Bettis, Mr. Sure Hands, fumbled the ball on the one yard line.  Nick Harper picked it up and was going back all the way and the game was over and out of nowhere Ben Roethlisberger made ""THE TACKLE"" as it will forever be known.  Big Ben saved the game.  Vanderjagt botched the game-tying field goal.  Jerome Bettis is redeemed.  The Steelers, this fiesty bunch of sixth seed misfit road warriors is on to Denver for the AFC Championship Game....Denver?  The Steelers?  Denver is undefeated at home.  Denver has never lost an AFC Championship Game at home.  The Steelers are the sixth seed that got lucky in Cinncinati and Indy and are ready to get a dose of Jake ""The Snake"" Plummer.  The Steelers are going down.  Once again....someone forgot to go into the Steelers' locker room and tell Big Ben and Hines Ward and Willie Parker and Jerome Bettis and Joey Porter and all the Black & Gold that they were done for and might as well make their reservations for the return trip to Pittsburgh.  Home field.  Home crowd.  The 13-3 Denver Broncos were about to show the Steelers how football is played in Mile-high Stadium.  Wrong.  Big Ben came out firing and the Steelers' D came out and punched Jake ""The Fake"" right in the mouth and for four agonizing quarters, the Denver Broncos were shown what it's like to play Steelers' Football in Mile-high Stadium.The Bus is headed back home to Detroit to play in his final NFL game.On to Super Bowl  XL.  On to the Seattle Seahawks.  On to greatness.The Steelers took the long road to Super Bowl XL.  The became the first sixth seed to ever make it to the big game.  They became the only team to ever win three straight on the road, get to the Super Bowl, and then win it.  Ben Roethlisberger became the youngest quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl.  Hines Ward was XL's MVP.  Willie Parker set a record for running in a 75-yard touchdown and Antwaan Randle El became the first WR to ever throw a touchdown pass in the Super Bowl.....  And Jerome ""The Bus"" Bettis was able to retire as a Champion.Storybook endings on a storybook season.  The Pittsburgh Steelers, 2005 World Champions.I could watch this DVD a thousand times and still not get bored with it.  Great footage of a great season.  Lots of little extras including the Game Of The Week  Steelers@Colts Playoff Game.  Nice little montage of The Bus & Bill Cowher.  If you love the Steelers, this is a must.  If you don't....it's still one hell of an inspirational story.Dig it!!!!!",5,Five Stars For Five Super Bowl Rings - Great STEELERS DVD!!!,1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,5144,"['diehard', 'Pittsburgh',
