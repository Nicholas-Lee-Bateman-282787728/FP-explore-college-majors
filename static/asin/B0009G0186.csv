He told me that it was a horrible concert.  There was no bass or bottom. I couldn't believe that particular criticism.  They type of music that is Seal, it is very important to have a solid and full bottom.Well I just received this dvd today and just finished watching it.There is absolutely nothing bad I can say about this live performance.Everything is there and on point.  Seal's voice is perfect and the musicians are tight and really know how to lay it down.If you are more familiar with Seal's older songs, well that may cause you to hesistate to purchase this.  The concert consists of songs from his latest cd. Don't let that stop you.  You will find to like them all and even have a new appreciation for his newer stuffSeal has not yet to dissappoint with anything he has put out thus far.Get this dvd! It's a gem",5,Everything is On-point,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,926,"['Years', 'ago', 'Seal', 'released', 'second', 'album', 'friend', 'mine', 'wife', 'went', 'saw', 'live', 'told', 'was', 'horrible', 'concert', 'was', 'bass', 'bottom', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'particular', 'criticism', 'type', 'music', 'Seal', 'very', 'important', 'have', 'solid', 'full', 'bottom.Well', 'just', 'received', 'dvd', 'today', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'it.There', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'bad', 'can', 'say', 'live', 'performance.Everything', 'there', 'point', 'Seal', 'voice', 'perfect', 'musicians', 'are', 'tight', 'really', 'know', 'how', 'lay', 'are', 'more', 'familiar', 'Seal', 'older', 'songs', 'well', 'may', 'cause', 'hesistate', 'purchase', 'concert', 'songs', 'latest', 'cd', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'will', 'find', 'like', 'even', 'have', 'new', 'appreciation', 'newer', 'stuffSeal', 'not', 'yet', 'dissappoint', 'anything', 'put', 'out', 'thus', 'far.Get', 'dvd', 'gem']",N/A

I wasn't expecting a big production, and rightly so.  Seal does little more than stand on stage grasping the mike stand as he sings.  But this show is not about being a spectacle.  It's the music that's on display here, and Seal and his four bandmates do such an incredible job playing these songs.  Seal's voice is in top form, and the audience is 150% into the show.  I was mesmerized during the entire show!Most of the songs are from Seal IV and Seal II (1994 album), with a few from Seal I.  Sadly, there is only one song on here from Human Being.  That album definitely deserves much more exposure.  The DVD quality is spectacular.  The picture is crystal clear...never have I seen a concert DVD that captures the lighting effects so crisply.  There is no bleeding of colors, absolutely zero pixelation!  It's almost like being there.  The DTS sound is amazing...this is how all concert DVD's should be mixed.  I wouldn't be surprised if this DVD has better sound than that venue in Paris did!One word of warning though.  Amazon.com says this DVD package includes an audio CD of 14 tracks from the show.  That is incorrect.  This only has the DVD (and no special features).  The only package that has a CD and DVD is the one that comes in a CD jewel case.  Search ""Seal Live in Paris"" under Amazon's ""Popular Music"" category.  I'd actually recommend buying the 2-disc set, as most of the songs are done with a different arrangement.  I wish I'd bought that one instead of the DVD only.Again, a fantastic concert!",5,Great great show!,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,1642,"['Seal', 'have', 'very', 'specific', 'fan', 'base', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'one', 'Seal', 'album', 'really', 'going', 'enjoy', 'concert', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'big', 'production', 'rightly', 'so', 'Seal', 'little', 'more', 'stand', 'stage', 'grasping', 'mike', 'stand', 'show', 'not', 'being', 'spectacle', 'music', 'display', 'here', 'Seal', 'four', 'bandmates', 'do', 'incredible', 'job', 'playing', 'songs', 'Seal', 'voice', 'top', 'form', 'audience', '150', '%', 'show', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'entire', 'show', 'Most', 'songs', 'are', 'Seal', 'IV', 'Seal', 'II', '1994', 'album', 'few', 'Seal', 'Sadly', 'only', 'one', 'song', 'here', 'Human', 'Being', 'definitely', 'much', 'more', 'exposure', 'DVD', 'quality', 'spectacular', 'picture', 'crystal', 'clear', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'concert', 'DVD', 'lighting', 'effects', 'so', 'crisply', 'bleeding', 'colors', 'absolutely', 'zero', 'pixelation', 'almost', 'being', 'there', 'DTS', 'sound', 'amazing', 'how', 'concert', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'mixed', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'DVD', 'better', 'sound', 'venue', 'Paris', 'did', 'One', 'word', 'warning', 'Amazon.com', 'DVD', 'package', 'audio', 'CD', '14', 'tracks', 'show', 'incorrect', 'only', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'only', 'package', 'CD', 'DVD', 'one', 'CD', 'jewel', 'case', 'Search', 'Seal', 'Live', 'Paris', 'Amazon', 'Popular', 'Music', 'category', ""'d"", 'actually', 'recommend', 'buying', '2-disc', 'set', 'most', 'songs', 'are', 'done', 'different', 'arrangement', 'wish', ""'d"", 'bought', 'one', 'instead', 'DVD', 'only.Again', 'fantastic', 'concert']",N/A
