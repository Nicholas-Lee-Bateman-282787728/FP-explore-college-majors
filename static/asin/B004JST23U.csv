1411659,A182VTJIIEVM37,B004JST23U,GintaxAlvissforever,"[2, 2]","I got this series a few years ago on Valentine's day because of my fondness for shojo series. When I read the summary, I was happy about the concept of the genders being reversed where the guy is better at everything the girls try to do. Normally a romantic comedy tends to reverse this idea by making the girl being better than the guy because its a stereotype that a woman is better than the loser protagonist.It really irks me when people try to throw the sexist card with how no matter how good Hikari is, she'll always be second best to Kei. Given how many anime already have the woman be better than the man no matter what he does, this argument comes off as moot.The thing that DOES bug me though is the message that the series seems to say. &#34;No matter how hard you study or how hard you work, you'll never be good as the rich person who doesn't have to do anything and will be loved for not doing anything but sit there and look pretty/cute.&#34; Ouran High School actually avoided this concept by making Haruhi the logical member of the host club and showing that despite being the poor person, she was the smartest in the school and didn't need money to get in. In contrast here, all the Special A students are there because of their family and they just happen to be good at what they do. However, you never see them work hard because they're the type of students who wouldn't need an A in order to pass. So while this is served as a running gag and we cheer Hikari on because she's the only one who runs around to do something only to almost always be bought out by Kei because he has money in comparison to her who has to get people together and do the hard work, it also can rub many people the wrong way as it did to me because its like &#34;If you're just going to use money to win the competition and win the entire school because of money, then what's the point in trying?&#34;The other thing that irked me was the queer baiting or the treatment of characters who show some gay/lesbian attitude.SPOILERS TO THOSE WHO HAVEN'T WATCH THE SERIES.Akira's character is defined as her not liking men and constantly worshipping the ground Hikari is on. Then she later hooks up with Tadashi later on (and for me this comes off as a weak attempt to say she's not lesbian because she spends more time beating up and insulting Tadashi even when they hook up so it doesn't come off as genuine in comparison to how she acts around Hikari).Then we have Jun who's split personality is bisexual. That's fine and all except his split personality is treated as a bad thing for Jun who lost the first person he was dating because she couldn't stand his split personality. Yes he ends up with someone who will accept him for who he is, but it just rubs me the wrong way that the reason why he lost the first person in the first place was because of his split personality being a cassanova.Finally we have Ryuuji and Finn. Finn is shown to be a rather cute guy and Ryuuji and Finn seem to be the established gay pairing in the series...only to turn out that Finn is a masculine woman...So three instances of a character showing any homo vibe gets shot down almost immediately mainly because the series just pairs them up with the opposite gender (and we also have a case of just pairing people who don't have anyone with whoever is left like Megumi and Yashiro that came out of nowhere).END SPOILERSHonestly because of these 2 things that really bugged me about the series, it was hard for me to give it a high rating. I had my laughs with the main pairing regardless of the rich vs. poor thing but all the beta couples in comparison fall apart because of how I feel the series handled the yaoi/yuri tones the wrong way. Besides what I mentioned above, it is a good series and should give it a watch. I just honestly prefer Ouran High School better with how they handled the yaoi/yuri tropes.",3,A Good Series but I expected more,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,3892,"['got', 'series', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Valentine', 'day', 'fondness', 'shojo', 'series', 'When', 'read', 'summary', 'was', 'happy', 'concept', 'genders', 'being', 'reversed', 'where', 'guy', 'better', 'everything', 'girls', 'try', 'do', 'Normally', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'tends', 'reverse', 'idea', 'making', 'girl', 'being', 'better', 'guy', 'stereotype', 'woman', 'better', 'loser', 'protagonist.It', 'really', 'irks', 'when', 'people', 'try', 'throw', 'sexist', 'card', 'how', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'Hikari', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'second', 'best', 'Kei', 'Given', 'how', 'many', 'anime', 'already', 'have', 'woman', 'be', 'better', 'man', 'matter', 'what', 'argument', 'off', 'moot.The', 'thing', 'DOES', 'bug', 'message', 'series', 'say', '34', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'study', 'how', 'hard', 'work', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'good', 'rich', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'will', 'be', 'loved', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'sit', 'there', 'look', 'pretty/cute.', '34', 'Ouran', 'High', 'School', 'actually', 'avoided', 'concept', 'making', 'Haruhi', 'logical', 'member', 'host', 'club', 'showing', 'being', 'poor', 'person', 'was', 'smartest', 'school', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'money', 'get', 'contrast', 'here', 'Special', 'A', 'students', 'are', 'there', 'family', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'However', 'never', 'see', 'work', 'hard', ""'re"", 'type', 'students', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'need', 'A', 'order', 'pass', 'So', 'served', 'running', 'gag', 'cheer', 'Hikari', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'do', 'something', 'only', 'almost', 'always', 'be', 'bought', 'out', 'Kei', 'money', 'comparison', 'who', 'get', 'people', 'together', 'do', 'hard', 'work', 'also', 'can', 'rub', 'many', 'people', 'wrong', 'way', 'did', '34', ""'re"", 'just', 'going', 'use', 'money', 'win', 'competition', 'win', 'entire', 'school', 'money', 'then', 'what', 'point', 'trying', '34', 'other', 'thing', 'irked', 'was', 'queer', 'baiting', 'treatment', 'characters', 'who', 'show', 'gay/lesbian', 'attitude.SPOILERS', 'TO', 'THOSE', 'WHO', 'HAVE', ""N'T"", 'WATCH', 'THE', 'SERIES.Akira', 'character', 'defined', 'not', 'liking', 'men', 'constantly', 'worshipping', 'ground', 'Hikari', 'Then', 'later', 'hooks', 'up', 'Tadashi', 'later', 'off', 'weak', 'attempt', 'say', 'not', 'lesbian', 'more', 'time', 'beating', 'up', 'insulting', 'Tadashi', 'even', 'when', 'hook', 'up', 'so', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'genuine', 'comparison', 'how', 'Hikari', '.Then', 'have', 'Jun', 'who', 'split', 'personality', 'bisexual', 'fine', 'split', 'personality', 'treated', 'bad', 'thing', 'Jun', 'who', 'lost', 'first', 'person', 'was', 'dating', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'split', 'personality', 'up', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'accept', 'who', 'just', 'rubs', 'wrong', 'way', 'reason', 'why', 'lost', 'first', 'person', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'split', 'personality', 'being', 'cassanova.Finally', 'have', 'Ryuuji', 'Finn', 'Finn', 'shown', 'be', 'rather', 'cute', 'guy', 'Ryuuji', 'Finn', 'seem', 'be', 'established', 'gay', 'pairing', 'series', 'only', 'turn', 'out', 'Finn', 'masculine', 'woman', 'So', 'three', 'instances', 'character', 'showing', 'homo', 'vibe', 'shot', 'down', 'almost', 'immediately', 'mainly', 'series', 'just', 'pairs', 'up', 'opposite', 'gender', 'also', 'have', 'case', 'just', 'pairing', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anyone', 'whoever', 'left', 'Megumi', 'Yashiro', 'came', 'nowhere', '.END', 'SPOILERSHonestly', '2', 'things', 'really', 'bugged', 'series', 'was', 'hard', 'give', 'high', 'rating', 'had', 'laughs', 'main', 'pairing', 'regardless', 'rich', 'vs.', 'poor', 'thing', 'beta', 'couples', 'comparison', 'fall', 'apart', 'how', 'feel', 'series', 'handled', 'yaoi/yuri', 'wrong', 'way', 'what', 'mentioned', 'good', 'series', 'should', 'give', 'watch', 'just', 'honestly', 'prefer', 'Ouran', 'High', 'School', 'better', 'how', 'handled', 'yaoi/yuri', 'tropes']",N/A

The individual episodes were not interesting and there was no overall story line pulling together all the episodes.

Also for me high school anime is relaxing as for most of us high school was much more simple and innocent than adult life.For me the gold standards in high school anime are GTO, School Rumble, and His and Her Circumstances.

1411663,AFV2584U13XP3,B004JST23U,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[3, 4]","The series seems to have a nice mix of Ouran Host Club/Suzuka/Haruhi Suzumiya to it,  and while the series won't blow you out of the water with its story or anything it's still a very enjoyable series to watch.  The small basic story plot is that you have the main female character who has been defeated by the main male character since childhood in about almost everything still tries her all in getting her first victory over him but as the story progresses they also develop a romantic relationship that is unexpected by either of them and now both must try to sort out these new found feelings between them.  The series overall story is enjoyable as are the other cast characters we have in the series as well,  the series only comes subbed at this time but the cast did a terrific job in their character roles.  The animation might feel a little reminiscent to series XXX/Holic or Tsubassa or even One Piece a little also the soundtrack was a nice match to the series as well nothing that really stands out as truly memorable but still not bad.  If I have any complaints it's that the series box came in a single dvd case with a center spindle to stack all four dvds on top of one another,  I would have figured that Section 23 would have at least by now put the series set collections in a little better box set.  Though at the end if you like enjoyable school anime stories with endearing characters,  a decent story and sound ending here's a good choice for you.  Someone has asked if this series will be coming out dubbed and with how Section23 is doing things it probably will but until than we have this set to entertain us.",5,Enjoyable Enough Series Worth Looking Into,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,1635,"['series', 'have', 'nice', 'mix', 'Ouran', 'Host', 'Club/Suzuka/Haruhi', 'Suzumiya', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'blow', 'water', 'story', 'anything', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'watch', 'small', 'basic', 'story', 'plot', 'have', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'who', 'been', 'defeated', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'childhood', 'about', 'almost', 'everything', 'still', 'all', 'getting', 'first', 'victory', 'story', 'also', 'develop', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'unexpected', 'now', 'must', 'try', 'sort', 'out', 'new', 'found', 'feelings', 'series', 'overall', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'other', 'cast', 'characters', 'have', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'only', 'subbed', 'time', 'cast', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'character', 'roles', 'animation', 'might', 'feel', 'little', 'reminiscent', 'series', 'XXX/Holic', 'Tsubassa', 'even', 'One', 'Piece', 'little', 'also', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'nice', 'match', 'series', 'well', 'nothing', 'really', 'out', 'truly', 'memorable', 'still', 'not', 'bad', 'have', 'complaints', 'series', 'box', 'came', 'single', 'dvd', 'case', 'center', 'spindle', 'stack', 'four', 'dvds', 'top', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'figured', 'Section', '23', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'now', 'put', 'series', 'set', 'collections', 'little', 'better', 'box', 'set', 'end', 'like', 'enjoyable', 'school', 'anime', 'stories', 'endearing', 'characters', 'decent', 'story', 'sound', 'ending', 'here', 'good', 'choice', 'Someone', 'asked', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'dubbed', 'how', 'Section23', 'doing', 'things', 'probably', 'will', 'have', 'set', 'entertain']",N/A
