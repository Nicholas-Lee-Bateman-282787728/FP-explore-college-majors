In generalthis movie reminded me of ""Red Dawn"" in the rebellion stages  and so forth, ""Red Dawn"" was much better. It was really hard to believe that this story took place in a galaxy far away and all that, every scene outside looked Canadian or northern US. I will probably avoid any more Dean Cain movies after seeing this one. Seemed like a lot of bit part semi-stars that I see in a lot  movies and TV shows, but it really lost me. It was really cheap and used and I forced myself and my brother to sit through it to the end.

Skimming through some of the reviews, I found that some of the actors and actresses are professionally employed in known productions. I guess that the weight of a dead script and direction can create leaden  performances from even people who are accepted as qualified to do more than high school productions.I see some reviewers believe otherwise, so I will simply refer the reader to them with the unnecessary (I'm sure) admonition that tastes vary in this caveat emptor (buyer beware) buying world.If you are persuaded to buy the film, I would advise buying (with Amazon Prime) the '10 Movie Sci-Fi Pack' for under five dollars and getting nine other movies with it.",1,No Sense Beating Up on This One,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,825,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'own', 'eyes', 'Miramax', 'was', 'associated', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'believed', 'possible', 'whichever', 'owners', 'were', 'control', 'Skimming', 'reviews', 'found', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'professionally', 'employed', 'known', 'productions', 'guess', 'weight', 'dead', 'script', 'direction', 'can', 'create', 'leaden', 'performances', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'accepted', 'qualified', 'do', 'more', 'high', 'school', 'productions.I', 'see', 'reviewers', 'believe', 'otherwise', 'will', 'simply', 'refer', 'reader', 'unnecessary', ""'m"", 'sure', 'admonition', 'vary', 'caveat', 'emptor', 'buyer', 'beware', 'buying', 'world.If', 'are', 'persuaded', 'buy', 'film', 'would', 'advise', 'buying', 'Amazon', 'Prime', ""'10"", 'Movie', 'Sci-Fi', 'Pack', 'five', 'dollars', 'getting', 'nine', 'other', 'movies']",Final Encounter

720686,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B00006LPH9,Moviedude,"[2, 2]","Final Encounter (also known in some markets as ""For the Cause"") reunites Lois and Clark alums Dean Cain and Justin Whalin as futuristic soldiers on a distant, war-torn planet. Their nation of Brecca has almost crumbled under the offensive of the rival city-state Obsidian (each side being companies responsible for colonizing the world) and is now little more than a handfull of paramilitary encampments scavenging the ruins of their own society. Teaming with a motley crew of commandos, including two ""programmers"" (all-female users of all-but-forgotten mental projection technology who are analogous to witches in the film's neo-feudal society) they embark on a quest to deliver an electronic countermeasure that will disable Obsidian's advanced technology.This plot is a lot to swallow, and that is really the film's main sticking point. We are asked to assimilate volumes of lore, some of it presented only very briefly, in order to understand a planetary history spanning over a century of politicking and war. It's a rich, inventive history, but the film just can't express it well enough in its running time to make us care. That's too bad, because there is a lot about Encounter to enjoy.First of all, the cinematography is aces. The rugged countryside and crumbling post-soviet architecture of Bulgaria are used to brilliant, Tarkovsky-esque effect to convey the idea of a modern society in ruins. Costuming is a believable mix of futuristic and contemporary. Weapons seem sophisticated, but not so much so as to be silly. And the effects, for such a modestly budgeted film, are quite good- about on par with the Stargate TV series, to which this film is contemporary. Some of the cyberpunk ""magic"" the programmers display is a little fake looking, however, and in crowd scenes the actors are not directed well in reacting to CG.Second, the acting is quite good. Cain and Whalin have made careers in TV and direct-to-video schlock, but their performances here (alongside a similarly talented cast) remind the viewer that these actors were once considered rising stars until an inability to escape TV (Cain) and being tied to the horrible Dungeons and Dragons film for 7 years (Whalin) doomed them to the B list.Final Encounter is not at all a bad film, but its tremendous ambition just barely exceeds its grasp. It could have made a deeply compelling TV series, and with more money and a more spaced out plot it might have been a really brilliant film. It's still worth your time if you're a fan of other clever budget sci fi, like Hardware, Screamers, Hunter Prey, or even (dare I say it) Krull, all of which it resembles. Just prepare to be disappointed at what it could have been.PROS-Good performances-Above average effects-Strong attempt at original worldbuilding-Great locationsCONS-Too much lore for one film to fit-Effects just try TOO hard in places-Action sequences are a little confusing in places",3,Better than it has any right to be- still not very good.,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,2917,"['Final', 'Encounter', 'also', 'known', 'markets', 'Cause', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'alums', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Justin', 'Whalin', 'futuristic', 'soldiers', 'distant', 'war-torn', 'planet', 'nation', 'Brecca', 'almost', 'crumbled', 'offensive', 'rival', 'city-state', 'Obsidian', 'side', 'being', 'companies', 'responsible', 'colonizing', 'world', 'now', 'little', 'more', 'handfull', 'paramilitary', 'encampments', 'scavenging', 'ruins', 'own', 'society', 'Teaming', 'motley', 'crew', 'commandos', 'including', 'two', 'programmers', 'all-female', 'users', 'all-but-forgotten', 'mental', 'projection', 'technology', 'who', 'are', 'analogous', 'witches', 'film', 'neo-feudal', 'society', 'embark', 'quest', 'deliver', 'electronic', 'countermeasure', 'will', 'disable', 'Obsidian', 'advanced', 'technology.This', 'plot', 'lot', 'swallow', 'really', 'film', 'main', 'sticking', 'point', 'are', 'asked', 'assimilate', 'volumes', 'lore', 'presented', 'only', 'very', 'briefly', 'order', 'understand', 'planetary', 'history', 'spanning', 'century', 'politicking', 'war', 'rich', 'inventive', 'history', 'film', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'well', 'enough', 'running', 'time', 'make', 'care', 'too', 'bad', 'lot', 'Encounter', 'enjoy.First', 'cinematography', 'aces', 'rugged', 'countryside', 'crumbling', 'post-soviet', 'architecture', 'Bulgaria', 'are', 'used', 'brilliant', 'Tarkovsky-esque', 'effect', 'convey', 'idea', 'modern', 'society', 'ruins', 'Costuming', 'believable', 'mix', 'futuristic', 'contemporary', 'Weapons', 'seem', 'sophisticated', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'be', 'silly', 'effects', 'modestly', 'budgeted', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'good-', 'par', 'Stargate', 'TV', 'series', 'film', 'contemporary', 'cyberpunk', 'magic', 'programmers', 'display', 'little', 'fake', 'looking', 'however', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'directed', 'well', 'reacting', 'CG.Second', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'Cain', 'Whalin', 'have', 'made', 'careers', 'TV', 'direct-to-video', 'schlock', 'performances', 'here', 'similarly', 'talented', 'cast', 'viewer', 'actors', 'were', 'once', 'considered', 'rising', 'stars', 'inability', 'escape', 'TV', 'Cain', 'being', 'tied', 'horrible', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'film', '7', 'years', 'Whalin', 'doomed', 'B', 'list.Final', 'Encounter', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'tremendous', 'ambition', 'just', 'barely', 'grasp', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'deeply', 'compelling', 'TV', 'series', 'more', 'money', 'more', 'spaced', 'plot', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'brilliant', 'film', 'still', 'worth', 'time', ""'re"", 'fan', 'other', 'clever', 'budget', 'sci', 'fi', 'Hardware', 'Screamers', 'Hunter', 'Prey', 'even', 'dare', 'say', 'Krull', 'Just', 'prepare', 'be', 'disappointed', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been.PROS-Good', 'performances-Above', 'average', 'effects-Strong', 'attempt', 'original', 'worldbuilding-Great', 'locationsCONS-Too', 'much', 'lore', 'one', 'film', 'fit-Effects', 'just', 'try', 'TOO', 'hard', 'places-Action', 'sequences', 'are', 'little', 'confusing', 'places']",Final Encounter
