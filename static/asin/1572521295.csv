Adrian treats his tenants contemptuously, is disgusted by the drag queen who rents from him, yet is incredibly attracted to Jack.

185871,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,1572521295,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 5]","This is an excellent film with a risky and unexpected screenplay and exceptional acting. Colin Firth and Hart Bochner are perfectly paired to play totally opposite types who begin to play identify games where the stakes are very high. We have become so used to highly predictable plots with over the top special effects that it is certainly pleasing to see a film this is very difficult to predict and which takes some many radical plot changes that the viewer has to stay constantly on their toes. One character is a homicidal psychopath, another is a totally neurotic closeted gay man, and the mother of the neurotic is a schizophrenic. This is a wonderful portrait of a psychopath for they lie with such casual elegance that everyone believes them, they inflict pain on others with no remorse, they will commit murder, they may be bisexual, they know how to manipulate everyone around them, and they are so totally charming. It is also a film about beauty for people project their needs and desires on the beautiful object or person and if that person is a psychopath, then they are in great danger. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat as these encounters unroll and you are always uncertain as to whether somewhat was going to have sex or get murdered. This is also a fascinating story about identity and the changeability of identify given the right moment and motivation. Jack rents a room from Adrian and immediately begins to try to steal his passport to leave Argentina but eventually begins to take on more of Adrian's identity until the stakes get so high that only one can emerge alive.  It is a film about obsession, sexual clinging embarrassing obsession. Adrian's obsession for Jack is almost painful to watch, yet a psychopath loves such attention for it allows them to remain in total control as the person who is obsessing about them loses all dignity and reason in a world of unmet desire and unrelieved fantasy. It is a film about repression, both political and sexual, and the terrible consequences of repression. What type of man is willing to kill innocent people for quick cash? We certainly get an answer in this film and it is not pretty. It is a multi-layered film, full of ironic dark humor. If the consequences were not so violent, it could even be viewed as a black comedy, for victims are perceived as murderers and murderers are perceived as victims. I think most folks will enjoy the cat and mouse games played by film nut Adrian LeDuc, played by Colin Firth, and Jack Carney, played by Hart Bochner. They live in an apartment building full of nosey people whose idiosyncrasies are charming and play right into the hands of master manipulator Jack Carney.

185877,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,1572521295,James Morris,"[13, 16]","As this is a thriller, I do not want to give away too many plot points, but please be aware that my review contains more than a few ""spoilers"".  So if you have not seen the film, and especially if you do not want to know critical plot points, please skip to the next review.The new DVD release is being heavily marketed to a gay audience as a ""homo-erotic"" thriller; there are even full-page ads for the DVD in gay magazines, labeling it as such.  To start, let's say the film concerns the relationship of two men, one of whom is emotionally and possibly romantically dependent on the other, and one who may be a mercenary killer, sought for a series of gruesome political murders.The character of Adrian is, ultimately, the most complex, satisfying and interesting person in a script filled with complex and interesting people.  He lives in Buenos Aires, where he runs an art theatre that shows classic American films.  He also cares for his mentally ill mother, while attempting to deflect the intrusions of his neighbors, who are themselves an interesting assortment of oddballs and gossipmongers.  When hard times and the hospitalization of his mother force Adrian to rent out her room to make ends meet, his world begins to unravel.There is an undeniable sexual tension between Adrian and Jack that drives the entire film, and several key elements of the plot.  It appears that Jack is very much aware of Adrian's attraction to him, which he exploits, and that Adrian is not fully aware of his sexual attraction to his new ""friend"".  After all, Jack is very much a man of the world - he is friendly and encouraging to the character of a drag queen, after ""rescuing"" her from a violent homophobe in a movie theatre.  Jack also easily picks up a gay man when he needs to, and is clearly practiced at doing so.  There are indications that he *may* have had sex with one of his victims, or even the drag queen.  The character of Jack is obviously used to the attention his good looks get from both sexes.  Although he gives certain clues that he himself is heterosexual, several actions on his part could be interpreted as indications that he is at least ""gay"" when it is to his advantage, if he is not an outright bisexual.As for Adrian, it seems clear to me (of course, I am a gay man) that Adrian is a closeted homosexual.  He is so closeted, in fact, that it is possible that he does not even realize his own homosexuality.  He has been living a life of isolation, caring for his mentally ill mother, and has suppressed his sexual desires to the point where he is not even aware of them.  There are many such gay people who convince themselves that they are not gay, and even manage to deny their own attractions. The key to this is Adrian's answer to Jack about whether or not he likes girls - ""I like women - the kind that can't be picked up"". This is an extremely common defense for repressed homosexuals, and used to be much more common in the days when homosexuality was considered unmentionable.  It's still very much prevalent in cultures and environments where homosexuality is greatly stigmatized.  So Adrian ""thinks"" he likes girls, and is possibly even attracted to them; we can convince ourselves of all sorts of things.  Many young gay people convince themselves that they are attracted to the opposite sex, simply because they are taught that heterosexuality is ""normal"", until the time comes when then can no longer deny their true desires.  Adrian is safe thinking he's heterosexual, because he's never allowed himself to get close enough to a woman to actually have a sexual relationship with one.  It makes perfect sense, if you're a repressed gay person, to convince yourself that you are straight in order to convince others.  It used to be extremely common for repressed gay men to even marry women, and once the honeymoon is over, to settle down to a sexless marriage.  Such men also enjoy the legal and social advantages of a heterosexual marriage, convincing themselves that they can be content with the companionship of their spouse.  Some women even prefer such marriages, and marry men they consciously or unconsciously know are gay.  This is one of the sad consequences of remaining closeted.  Being ""in the closet"" had a different connotation in my day; today being in the closet usually means you do not disclose your homosexuality to the world around you.  When I was first coming out, to be ""in the closet"" meant that you had not yet realized your own homosexuality.  This was back when there was so little talk about homosexuality that even some homosexuals didn't know that homosexuality existed.  How do you acknowledge your attraction to members of your own sex, if you are not aware that such a thing is possible?When Jack comes to see the apartment, we see that Adrian is clearly attracted to him, although my theory is, Adrian does not realize it himself, although the audience cannot possibly miss the nervous stammering, and the desperation in his voice and manner as he tries to ""sell"" Jack on moving in, after rejecting so many potential roommates.It is interesting that this ""homo-erotic"" thriller contains so many clear images of same-sex attraction, without any overt suggestion of homosexuality, except for the presence of a single transvestite.  Any gay person would recognize this film as extremely homo-erotic, yet I can see some heterosexuals not realizing this angle at all, for the simple fact of its never being explicitly stated.  It is therefore very difficult, not to mention frustrating, to discern the screenwriter and director's motive for keeping the ""homo-eroticism"" as repressed as Adrian obviously is.  It simply does not seem possible that the people connected with this film were not aware of its intense same-sex eroticism.I also believe there are signs that Adrian is becoming emotionally unglued long before the end of the film.  Several points in the last few minutes of the film are deliberately murky, but I have no problem with films that allow the viewer their own interpretation.  It is also possible that this is the point of the sexual ambiguity of the two main characters.  Whatever your conclusion, this is a film that will make you think, and a thriller that will haunt you long after it's over.  And isn't that what a good movie should do?",4,"""Homo-Erotic Thriller"" With No Gay Sex",1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,6325,"['thriller', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'plot',

This is where two 2-hour long commentaries on this DVD made so many things crystal clear, or at least as clear as it could be made.Should anyone HAVE to be told what a director was trying to communicate? I say ""NO"" if I am paying good money to see something at the theatre;but in this case,I was so willing to learn.That some of the acting in this film was nothing short of brilliant so intrigued me:but with a script and direction that seemed so misguided I was compelled to watch the commentaries (which I have RARELY ever done!)If you have seen this thriller and had the same dumbfounded reaction as I, then watch both the producer commentary and then the director commentary and you will learn that the confusion that you felt was not unfounded at all.This was a private ""baby"" of then young novice Martin Donovan who had a very clear picture in his own mind what this film was about,yet willingly admits the myriad of mistakes and shortsightedness that he had then and how he laments that things could have been done differently.His vision never is quite clearly communicated.He admits that he was in a ""total state of frenzy all the time"" and that his naivete played a great deal into the final outcome of APARTMENT ZERO.Donovan freely admits that many scenes do not make sense.(I agree!) He also admits that he was so intrigued with all of the actors, that he stopped directing and let the actor decide where the scene should go (sometime wisely, and other times not so!) What IS undeniably refreshing in this commentary is the enormous respect that Donovan had/has for Colin Firth, who is truly exceptional in his role as severe recluse Adrian Leduc.Donovan talks candidly,yet with now much-learned wisdom, about all of the severe criticism that this film encountered when it was released.By watching this commentary, then rewatching the film,APARTMENT ZERO may not be a world winner,but it certainly is far more accessible than an initial viewing.The producer commentary with David Koepp and Stephen Soderbergh is just as enlightening.They talk about the lack of funds, the need to cut corners in a time when you would do anything in order to get your independent film noticed.Family members are used to fill in as actors and even lawsuits and liens were placed against the film until all loans were paid.If anyone thinks making a film is easy,WATCH THE PRODUCER COMMENTARY!All-in-all, this DVD was one of the most odd yet delightful surprises that any intense film lover,and especially novice writers and directors, could find of great interest and benefit in what to do and what to avoid.There is one undeniable fact about this film,though: Colin Firth shows what an amazing actor he is and what total abandon he puts into this role.This film will never be any better.But, in your mind you can so appreciate it more with just the right amount of

It teeters on the edge of homosexuality and true friendship and at the same time casts Colin Firth as almost a damsel on the edge of madness to Hart Bochners rogue character.  This movie is set in Buenos Aires and and creates a political climate, a delicate madness and an under current of so many divergent sexualities that fuel the film and keep pulling the rope taunter and taunter.What makes this film so good is how eventually Firth's character expresses his love for a man who is a ne'erdowell and always will be.  He goes to the brink of madness and violence but never of sexuality which is what twists this fikm in upon itself.  Eventually it seems as if the relationship between the two becomes too fraught with peril for sex but all of there actions for each other are sexualized.What I find interesting about this movie is that it in no way compromises its sexuality to be politically correct and instead challenges the watcher to stick with it thru a byzantine plot of identity that switches the nerd for the rogue and then the rogue for the nerd.  Both men ultimately have no identity.  firth's character by harsh abuse racked upon him by his family and currently dementia trapped mother and Bochner thru the way he must live for his terrorist lifestyle.In the end Firth learns to absorb Bochner's character to have an identity and Bochner hesitates and theefore loses his own.

The casting of Colin Firth was a coup for the filmmakers; he projects the squirmiest sense of psychosis since Anthony Perkins. There are a series of escalatingly creepy scenes between Firth and his crazy mother. Yikes! The gay subtext between Colin Firth's character and Hart Bochner's is nicely played by both actors. I liked the fact that the film wasn't shot or set in the United States. This is a hard film to classify. Is it a serial killer thriller? sort of. Is it a psycho film like REPULSION or The Tenant?

185890,AQE41QO3NEUMW,1572521295,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[7, 7]","The best thing about this DVD is the commentary by co-writer David Koepp and ""special guest"" Steven Soderbergh, whose landmark ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" dates from the same time period (the late 1980s). The two of them use ""Apartment Zero"" as a reference point while they discuss the making of movies in general - from writing vs. directing to the most interesting way to present the discovery of a body. Koepp recalls his working relationship with writer/director Martin Donovan and describes the evolution of the film from an allegory about Argentina to the psychological thriller that materialized in the final cut. Director Donovan has his own commentary, but I stuck with Koepp and Soderbergh to the end.While the film itself feels a bit dated after twenty years, and it takes its own sweet time to explore its possibilities and eventually assume its inevitable direction, there is much to relish along the way. There's no real need for a cross-dresser in the story, for instance, but the film would be diminished without him. (And you have to wonder what was cut from the original three-hour version of the film.) Since 1988, we've seen Colin Firth emerge as a kind of coolly aloof and vaguely mournful romantic hero in just about anything he does, but here he is cast as a young man with what feels like the early onset of dementia, which certainly makes for a  change. Meanwhile, the weirdness of his handsome and self-absorbed apartment-mate (Hart Bochner) gives an edge to their relationship that compels a kind of helpless fascination, always defying predictability.The lesson from the Koepp-Soderbergh commentary is that independent films today have been so commercialized by the studios that they often lack the risk-taking that we see in a film like ""Apartment Zero."" A viewer today who objects to a film like this one has forgotten or never known what independent filmmaking can mean.

This is even more so in the capital of Buenos Aires. A city with an identity crisis, and a people uncertain about the future and haunted by a past of corruption and terror. A claustrophobic, anxious environment that is the setting for this film. Adrian, the resident of Apartment Zero, has created within that space a controlled, sanitized existence into which the outside world cannot penetrate. He purposefully avoids intimacy of any kind, preferring to absorb himself in a celluloid reality of male screen idols (Montgomery Clift, James Dean) and classic American movies. The outside world begins to close in on Adrian after his institutionalized mother dies and the necessity of having a cash-flow  forces him to rent one of the rooms in his flat.  The prospect of a suitable flat mate is grim until Jack walks into the room.  As Adrian puts it, Jack possesses a certain ""James Dean je ne sais quoi."" Jack turns out to be a chameleon of a man, who is also a quick study of human weakness and insecurity. In a short time, Jack has Adrian, along with the other lonely residences in the apartment complex, dependent upon his affections. All the while this interaction is going on, the ""classic American"" movie theater that Adrian operates, is now being used to show films from Argentina's past in an effort to hunt down former members of the death squads that once held the country in a state of terror.
