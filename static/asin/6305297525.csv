E Jackson,"[0, 0]","You probably need to be someone who can handle your emotional state of mind to keep it together while watching this one...What Dreams May Come is a really emotional love story... but not right away.  Quite the opposite in the beginning.  This part is about Robin Williams first losing his kids in a car accident, then losing himself in a separate car accident, and finally losing his wife to suicide.  Now that's what I call the ultimate depressing storyline!  However, it's not *entirely* devoted to sadness (hence the ""love story"" part).What happens is that Robin Williams eventually arrives in what appears to be either someone's imagination with painted backgrounds, or heaven itself.  Robin Williams is easily the star of this movie and receives the most attention.  For a little while, Robin Williams appears to be here alone and finds himself exploring the curiosities of this unexplainable and high imaginative world, but soon he meets up with his deceased dog now as a younger pup, and another man (and later on, a shrink with important knowledge concerning people's fate).  We then learn Robin is actually in heaven and the paintings are part of his wifes drawings.  Interesting stuff.As a viewer, you'll be totally caught up in the beautifully created backgrounds.  Nothing like I've ever seen in a movie, that's for sure.  The one segment with a bird flying above and soaring through painted skies is a highlight.Unfortunately this movie isn't without a few minor flaws.  For one thing, I'm not crazy about the belief that those who commit suicide go somewhere else.  I don't believe this personally- that's why I don't like it.  However that's not the reason I'm lowering the overall rating to 4-stars.  It wouldn't be fair to lower the rating based on personal beliefs anyway.  It's how the beauty and adventure of the heavenly state we experience in the first half is exchanged for a slow-moving emotional journey to find Robin's wife in the second half.

The Hell he visits is a nasty place, though it's  not quite as impressive as the film's visions of Heaven.'What Dreams May  Come' is only disappointing when you consider the message behind the story;  muddled together from dozens of religions, philosphies and New Age beliefs,  it ends up being a vision of the afterlife with very skewed morals: when  the hero's wife commits suicide, she is condemned to spend eternity in  Hell!  I mean, come on!  This is a terrible message.  I was also  unimpressed by the central couple's ultimate reincarnation as  toddlers-in-love - this was awfully cheesy.

Apparently, someone decided to take that idea and run with it.My biggest complaint was the depiction of the family.  This family was the driving force behind the movie: husband and wife, father and daughter, father and son, mother and daughter.  So, this needed to be a very good family.  And they constantly TELL us how much they love each other, but the only scenes we are SHOWN are ones in which they are fighting with each other, arguing with each other or just being neutral (the exception is the first meeting between the two leads).  According to studies in Sociology of the Family, one third of families are the fighting kind of family.  Apparently, the screenwriter thought that by portraying this kind of family, he was portraying a good family.  Unfortunately, the other two thirds won't be impressed.  So, for us the movie falls flat.A word about the myth-metaphysic: it must take a megalomaniac to undertake the paint of picture of heaven and hell.

The loss of your own life in the middle of busy life events due to a split second tragedy, leaving those behind crazy for your loss...and the guilt you would feel if you could experience what your death did to the lives of the ones you leave behind.

I always thought it would make a wonderful movie and waited for years until this one finally came out in the late 90s....I was so excited when I heard that it was finally going to be made into a movie...until I saw the movie.  I don't believe I have ever been more disappointed in my life in a book-to-movie movie.They took way too many liberties with regards to changes in the movie that it almost made it seem like a totally different story.  By killing off the children (which did not happen in the book) it made it seem like the grief Ann would have felt at losing Chris would not have been life shattering enough.  THEN they killed him off.  The point of the whole story was the closness between Chris and Ann...THEIR bond...which was stronger than anything else in their lives.  That was the point of the story.  And while I love Robin Williams, I felt that his portrayal of Chris bordered on silliness.  Hollywood even had to change Chris' profession...I guess him being a writer wasn't acceptable enough.....they made him a doctor.To say I was highly disappointed in the movie is an understatement.  I don't blame Richard Matheson for being disappointed as well..... "" I was disappointed in it, because it changed a good deal of my story, and I thought by their desire to have the two children die before him - they did that because they felt that if she committed suicide and left children behind, the audience would not like her, which, you know, may or may not be true - but it made for terrible complications, I thought, especially when they decided not even to identify them in the afterlife but to have them disguised as various other people.""

It has helped more than one friend come to terms with death, as a change of life, rather than  an end, and the necessity of concentrating one's life on the things that  are truly important. The movie is simply astounding. It adheres to the book  in all the most important aspects, and does so with the most beautiful  cinematography and special effects I have ever seen. This is not a  special-effects movie; it is a film about life and death and love, and all  of the wonderful scenery is only enhancement.  On the DVD, there is an  alternate ending, which is more in tune with the original ending in the  book, and which, to me, is better. The ending which the producers decided  was more acceptable I found too saccharine and not in tune with the rest of  the story.

458587,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,6305297525,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","How far would you be willing to go for your loved one(s)? It's always odd to see couples who fight about going to the movies or not wanting to visit your in-laws(which I won't argue with), here's a film where you're literally willing to go to Hell and back for the one you love. It's the very idea of true love that's for once on screen and the hope of what happens when death literally does you part.Chris meets Annie one day and the 2 become inseperable and get married. Years later they have 2 kids, which unfortunately are taken away from them in one day. Years later, celebrating an anniversary, Chris is also taken away. In the afterlife, he experiences everything spectacular your eyes can see, except one problem: due to grief and her suicide, Annie has to go to Hell. So Chris decides to go to Hell and bring her back.Beating Mighty Joe Young and Armageddon in the Visual Effects Oscar race, the film definately looks beautiful and colorful, especially in the afterlife where it resembles freshly painted canvas. For me personally where it gets lost is when we go to Hell when there's several funky shots that look a bit too CG but for the most part it's a very lush looking film.Acting wise it's very solid with Robin Williams finally showing he can be charming and likable without being manic and hyperactive(Robots, Aladdin anyone?) and Annabella Sciorra is great as the doomed wife. Oddly enough they don't have much chemistry which is odd, both are good performances but not enough chemistry. Everybody else is great including Cuba Gooding Jr as a kind of afterlife helper.It's the kind of film where it's depressing and hopeful at the same time. The idea of killing off an entire family and one of them goes to Hell is quite sad but everything else gives us hope about where we'll end up when we ""shuffle off this mortal coil"". It's a rare film where there's enough religious and spiritual imagery and concepts without being kind of ""doesn't our way of life rule"" which I always hated about those kind of films. You can be thought provoking without being evangelists in disguise.It's a leisurely paced film and its not very action-y but it gets to us through imagery and thought which is just fine with me.",4,Very beautiful and touching film,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,2221,"['How', 'far', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'go', 'loved', 'one', 's', 'always', 'odd', 'see', 'couples', 'who', 'fight', 'going', 'movies', 'not', 'wanting', 'visit', 'in-laws', 'wo', ""n't"", 'argue', 'here', 'film', 'where', ""'re"", 'literally', 'willing', 'go', 'Hell', 'back', 'one', 'love', 'very', 'idea', 'true', 'love', 'once', 'screen', 'hope', 'what', 'when', 'death', 'literally', 'part.Chris', 'meets', 'Annie', 'one', 'day', '2', 'become', 'inseperable', 'get', 'married', 'Years', 'later', 'have', '2', 'kids', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'taken', 'away', 'one', 'day', 'Years', 'later', 'celebrating', 'anniversary', 'Chris', 'also', 'taken', 'away', 'afterlife', 'everything', 'spectacular', 'eyes', 'can', 'see', 'one', 'problem', 'due', 'grief', 'suicide', 'Annie', 'go', 'Hell', 'So', 'Chris', 'go', 'Hell', 'bring', 'back.Beating', 'Mighty', 'Joe', 'Young', 'Armageddon', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'Oscar', 'race', 'film', 'definately', 'beautiful', 'colorful', 'especially', 'afterlife', 'where', 'freshly', 'painted', 'canvas', 'personally', 'where', 'lost', 'when', 'go', 'Hell', 'when', 'several', 'funky', 'shots', 'look', 'bit', 'too', 'CG', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'lush', 'looking', 'film.Acting', 'wise', 'very', 'solid', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'finally', 'showing', 'can', 'be', 'charming', 'likable', 'being', 'manic', 'hyperactive', 'Robots', 'Aladdin', 'anyone', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'great', 'doomed', 'wife', 'Oddly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'chemistry', 'odd', 'are', 'good', 'performances', 'not', 'enough', 'chemistry', 'Everybody', 'else', 'great', 'including', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr', 'kind', 'afterlife', 'helper.It', 'kind', 'film', 'where', 'depressing', 'hopeful', 'same', 'time', 'idea', 'killing', 'off', 'entire', 'family', 'one', 'Hell', 'quite', 'sad', 'everything', 'else', 'hope', 'where', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'when', 'shuffle', 'off', 'mortal', 'coil', 'rare', 'film', 'where', 'enough', 'religious', 'spiritual', 'imagery', 'concepts', 'being', 'kind', ""n't"", 'way', 'life', 'rule', 'always', 'hated', 'kind', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'thought', 'provoking', 'being', 'evangelists', 'disguise.It', 'leisurely', 'paced', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'action-y', 'imagery', 'thought', 'just', 'fine']",What Dreams May Come VHS

Ironic.Robin Williams dies and goes through heaven and hell? Cinematic gold.Robin Williams plays Chris Nielsen, a doctor devoted to his artist wife, Annie, played by Annabella Sciorra. They're a loving couple that have experienced the heartbreak of losing their children in a car wreck. But when Chris is killed in a car crash as well, he must learn to move on and accept his death. He watches over his widow for the first few days after having died. But then he is transported into a ""heaven"" which he manifests, a beautiful world of paint inspired by his wife's art. His former mentor played by Cuba Gooding, Jr., who is also dead but not what he appears to be, guides him as he creates his own reality. But when Annie commits suicide Chris must journey into a dark netherworld to save her. There she has created her own afterlife, a ""hell"" to match her despair and pain. Chris enlists the aid of a tracker, played by Max von Sydow who is also dead and yet again not what he appears to be, who will help him find Annie. Along the way Chris is reunited with his children and learns that only through faith and vulnerability can one become strong enough to heal.The film is directed by Vincent Ward and is a startling example of spiritual and psychological storytelling, even if the screenplay is convoluted at times. The film is based uponthe book by Richard Matheson. Visually the film is absolutely breathtaking and gives us for the first time in centuries, a truly original idea of what life after death may look like. What hurts the film is the awkward way the story unfolds through flashbacks. Some films can handle a non-linear story but the editor fails to set up a proper chronology before assembling this epic picture. However viewers should not be deterred by this minor annoyance. It's still worth seeing... again and again.The affordably priced DVD includes the following special features: audio commentary with Vincent Ward, alternate ending, two featurettes, photo gallery, cast & filmmakers' bios and filmographies, and dual interactive menus (one for Heaven and one for Hell).Also recommended:I Am Legendby Richard MathesonSomewhere In Timeby Richard MathesonA Stir of Echoesby Richard MathesonHell Houseby Richard MathesonSomewhere in TimeDead Again",4,The Afterlife Envisioned?,1211500800,"05 23, 2008",2008,2362,"['Robin', 'Williams', 'serious', 'role', 'Could', 'work.Robin', 'Williams', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'wife', 'Ironic.Robin', 'Williams', 'dies', 'heaven', 'hell', 'Cinematic', 'gold.Robin', 'Williams', 'Chris', 'Nielsen', 'doctor', 'devoted', 'artist', 'wife', 'Annie', 'played', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', ""'re"", 'loving', 'couple', 'have', 'experienced', 'heartbreak', 'losing', 'children', 'car', 'wreck', 'when', 'Chris', 'killed', 'car', 'crash', 'as', 'well', 'must', 'learn', 'move', 'accept', 'death', 'widow', 'first', 'few', 'days', 'having', 'died', 'then', 'transported', 'heaven', 'beautiful', 'world', 'paint', 'inspired', 'wife', 'art', 'former', 'mentor', 'played', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'who', 'also', 'dead', 'not', 'what', 'be', 'own', 'reality', 'when', 'Annie', 'suicide', 'Chris', 'must', 'journey', 'dark', 'netherworld', 'save', 'created', 'own', 'afterlife', 'hell', 'match', 'despair', 'pain', 'Chris', 'aid', 'tracker', 'played', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'who', 'also', 'dead', 'yet', 'again', 'not', 'what', 'be', 'who', 'will', 'help', 'find', 'Annie', 'way', 'Chris', 'reunited', 'children', 'only', 'faith', 'vulnerability', 'can', 'one', 'become', 'strong', 'enough', 'heal.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Vincent', 'Ward', 'startling', 'example', 'spiritual', 'psychological', 'storytelling', 'even', 'screenplay', 'convoluted', 'times', 'film', 'based', 'uponthe', 'book', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Visually', 'film', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'first', 'time', 'centuries', 'truly', 'original', 'idea', 'what', 'life', 'death', 'may', 'look', 'What', 'film', 'awkward', 'way', 'story', 'flashbacks', 'films', 'can', 'handle', 'non-linear', 'story', 'editor', 'set', 'up', 'proper', 'chronology', 'assembling', 'epic', 'picture', 'However', 'viewers', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'deterred', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'again', 'again.The', 'affordably', 'priced', 'DVD', 'following', 'special', 'features', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Vincent', 'Ward', 'alternate', 'ending', 'two', 'featurettes', 'photo', 'gallery', 'cast', 'filmmakers', 'bios', 'filmographies', 'dual', 'interactive', 'menus', 'one', 'Heaven', 'one', 'Hell', '.Also', 'recommended', 'Am', 'Legendby', 'Richard', 'MathesonSomewhere', 'Timeby', 'Richard', 'MathesonA', 'Stir', 'Echoesby', 'Richard', 'MathesonHell', 'Houseby', 'Richard', 'MathesonSomewhere', 'TimeDead', 'Again']",What Dreams May Come VHS

To someone like me who prizes wisdom above the torturous path to get wisdom, well ... let's just say that it seems those who don't probably have never gained wisdom in the first place and spend to much time romanticizing the way things were than appreciating what really happened and getting on with eternity.  In short, if that's what heaven is like (and I'm confident it isn't) then no wonder why so few people are interested in getting there.  Sad thing is ... I think most people think that's what it is and don't yet realize what a drag that kind of eternity would be.  IMO there is so much more to the universe and the rest of eternity than what's on this amazing little planet ... this life is just a stepping stone to get there, and well if I were to do a movie about what I think the afterlife is like ... it would blow your mind if you thought this movie came even moderately close.

458601,AVCRD98TH48RN,6305297525,D. Knouse,"[2, 2]","The best parts of this film are the excellent visual effects and the superb art direction.  The story is actually quite somber with death and the effect of sin on the afterlife being major, heavy themes.  The finest acting performance here comes from Annabella Sciorra, who survives the deaths of her two children with the help of her husband (played by a subdued Robin Williams), only to lose her husband a few years later.  That's when the story takes off.  Robin William's character, like all who enter the afterlife as good people, creates his own Heaven from his past experiences.  In his case, he was a huge fan of painting, and his painted Heaven is a one-of-a-kind visual effects creation.  After he becomes accustomed to his afterlife he is told that his wife commited suicide and will not be joining him in his Heaven, ever.  But True Love knows no bounds, and he obtains a tracker and eventually journeys into the circles of Hell (Dante-style, frequently reminiscent of the epic poem ""Infernus"") to find his beloved.  The realms in which this sojourn takes him are truly frightening and have many distrubing images.  While the ending is a little too schmaltzy for my tastes (even the alternate ending on the DVD has a similar feel to it), it is the type of ending the audience wants and deserves.  I just think they lay it on the viewer too thickly.  Robin Williams tries hard here and is more often good than not, but he ultimately feels miscast in this role.  Annabella Sciorra's performance more than makes up for Robin Williams being, well, 'himself' too often.  But the two leads do have some good chemistry together.  That, and the sublime special effects mixed with some spectacular set designs make this film work.  The DVD features are also enlightening and worth seeing.

458602,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6305297525,D. Litton,"[171, 190]","There is such a profound sense of drama, magic and emotion behind the story in &quot;What Dreams May Come,&quot; a film based on the novel by Richard Matheson. There is a strong story with which anyone who loves someone else can identify, as well as an austentatious and elegant scope of visual and auditory imagery that jumps right for your eyes onscreen. Matheson's visions of heaven and hell are magnificently realized here, as well as the love between two people that is unbreakable, even after death.The movie begins with the chance meeting of two American tourists traveling in Switzerland. Soon after, Chris and Annie become inseperable, and after their wedding, they bear two children. Many years later, Ian and Marie are killed in a car collision, leaving their parents distraught yet overcoming. Another couple of years later, Chris dies in a car accident as well, on his way to celebrate the &quot;Double D&quot; anniversary of his wife's emotional recovery from their childrens' deaths. This begins his trip into heaven, which is rocky at first during his attempts to console his living wife, then graduating into his acceptance of his immortality and ascemding into heaven, which turns out to be the creation of his own thoughts and settings. When he realizes that he is not completely happy without Annie, he becomes depressed, so it is no surprise that when Annie commits suicide and is sent to hell, he readies himself to rescue his wife from her emotional confines that keep her in her prison of eternal darkness.The story for this movie is very ambitious, as are the filmmakers who bring it to life. There is an abundance of vivid memories in the form of flashbacks, many of which are precisely used to move the plot along and keep the story moving. Instead of becoming bored with the ongoing story of Annie and Chris's married and parental life, I found myself becoming more and more entranced as their lives unfolded, and say what you will, but the only way to tell a story like this is through flashbacks. If you were to take all of the memories and place them in order at the beginning of the movie, the audience would forget about the important moments that have an effects on the actions and events that take place in later instances of the film. Each one is a separate piece of the puzzle, and they all fit together quite well.This film is one of those movies that showcases the possibilities for filmmaking in the future. Really, when you think about it, there is no way that the movie could have been made thirty years ago and still have the same impact as it does now. The settings and scenery play the most important role of the movie, for they provide the reason for the emotion and action that affects our characters. The beginning shots in Switzerland show us beautiful vistas of mountains and lakes, which will later become the inspiration for Chris's heaven, as well as many of the paintings Annie creates. Their home bursts forth with color and brightness, proving that color plays a big role in the film. When everyone is alive, everything seems light and airy. After Chris's death, all is dark, and the walls of the home seem dismal and gray. One scene in particular is a scene in which Chris watches his children being driven away in their van down a long line of lilac trees, a slight fog covering the scene. Their is that brilliance of color, yet the dark fog makes us uneasy, hence the accident that kills their children.Heaven is elegantly portrayed in this film, and is done so with a new twist: that each person has their own private heaven created in the image of their own personal desires and thoughts. Chris's heaven is based on the paintings of his wife, from the mountains of Switzerland to a small island in the middle of a mountain lake with an opulent, airy house. The filmmakers give each scene the precise look of a painting, even after the special effects fade, using vivid colors, lots of flowers and mountainous backdrops, to transport us into Chris's new world. This is one of the most incredible film achievements ever, taking us to a special place that is warm, inviting, and personifies every thought we, as an audience, have ever had for beauty and vision.Hell is given a truly horrifying and intense treatment, displaying visions of suffering as well as the personal and emotional pain of life that haunts us all. Somewhat like the way in which Heaven is created, Hell is seen as a persons's &quot;life gone wrong,&quot; which allows for the creation of their pain-driven eternity. The gateway to hell is a stunning visual image, a vast, smoky graveyard of smoldering shipwrecks that creak and groan. There is also a dismal, endless sea of decrepit faces of hell's inhabitants, that groan and scream at one another. The most striking of all the settings is the overturned cathedral, where Annie resides. The columns rise from the ceiling and go on forever into the darkness, which gives the whole place a sense of the neverending.There is a unique chemistry between the two leads that carries on the film's emotion and power. Robin Williams is charming, humorous and bold as Chris Nielsen, and through his acting and talent, he is able to make us believe in the love that Chris holds for Annie. Annabella Sciorra is moving as Annie, embodying all of the emotions and grief that set the stage for the second half of the story. When the two are together onscreen, they are happy and in love, and we buy it because they make it appear very authentic. Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays the angel that brings Chris to heaven, doing well in his performance of helping Chris through his struggle to realize his death. Max von Sydow, whose part is not as big as others he has had, is the tracker who takes them all to hell, and his words of wisdom keep the film's informative angle moving.&quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; will go down in history as one of the most innovative and spectacular films ever made, full of ambition and inspiration. In its story, we are taken on a journey of the human heart, as well as a striking vision of what may lie in store for everyone under God's eye.",5,Stellar film and visual effects!,981936000,"02 12,

The viewer also finds out that their two children were killed earlier in a car accident so when Chris dies, Annabella is  completely consumed by grief and chooses that life is not worth living any more. Chris is sent to heaven which is basically a Monet painting. The bright vivid colors were stunning and made it a joy to watch. Cuba Gooding Jr. welcomes Chris into the after life and eventually helps Chris in his quest to find Annie. At the time, I enjoyed the storyline but as I was watching it tonight on tv, I never realized until now just how hokey the storyline and dialogue could be. Despite the hokiness of the film, I still enjoy watching ""What Dreams May Come"". I think my favorite scenes had to be when Chris literally went to purgatory. The images and colors were spectacular. Those scenes of people falling from the waves as well as from the air and exploding when hitting the ground was stunning to say the least. Those scenes were pure eye candy. ""What Dreams May Come"" is a good movie. It isn't nowhere as emotionally manipulative as ""Patch Adams"" was except maybe for a few scenes that involved the children. Otherwise ""What Dreams May Come"" is a good popcorn movie. It may not be Masterpiece Theater but I will take this movie over something as tripe as ""Patch Adams"" or overblown as ""Armaggedeon"" any day.",4,Visually spectacular (unbelievably cheesy storyline),1077148800,"02 19, 2004",2004,1900,"['know', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'constant', 'punching', 'bag', 'movie', 'critics', 'alike', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'blockbuster', 'smash', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'sincerely', 'film', 'first', 'saw', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'when', 'was', 'movie', 'theaters', 'was', 'total', 'eye', 'candy', 'gorgeous', 'colors', 'art-like', 'quality', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'artist', 'creating', 'art', 'work', 'premise', 'film', 'bit', 'silly', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'character', 'Chris', 'killed', 'freak', 'accident', 'leaving', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'wife', 'Annie', 'played', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'devasted', 'alone', 'viewer', 'also', 'out', 'two', 'children', 'were', 'killed', 'earlier', 'car', 'accident', 'so', 'when', 'Chris', 'Annabella', 'completely', 'consumed', 'grief', 'life', 'not', 'worth', 'living', 'more', 'Chris', 'sent', 'heaven', 'basically', 'Monet', 'painting', 'bright', 'vivid', 'colors', 'were', 'stunning', 'made', 'joy', 'watch', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Chris', 'life', 'eventually', 'Chris', 'quest', 'find', 'Annie', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'storyline', 'was', 'watching', 'tonight', 'tv', 'never', 'realized', 'now', 'just', 'how', 'hokey', 'storyline', 'dialogue', 'could', 'be', 'hokiness', 'film', 'still', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'think', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'had', 'be', 'when', 'Chris', 'literally', 'went', 'purgatory', 'images', 'colors', 'were', 'spectacular', 'scenes', 'people', 'falling', 'waves', 'as', 'well', 'air', 'exploding', 'when', 'hitting', 'ground', 'was', 'stunning', 'say', 'least', 'scenes', 'were', 'pure', 'eye', 'candy', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'good', 'movie', ""n't"", 'nowhere', 'emotionally', 'manipulative', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'was', 'maybe', 'few', 'scenes', 'involved', 'children', 'Otherwise', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'good', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'will', 'take', 'movie', 'over', 'something', 'as', 'tripe', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'overblown', 'Armaggedeon', 'day']",What Dreams May Come VHS

While not perfect, it's one of the most visually stunning and thought-provoking films to come around in a long time. Chris (Robin Williams) and Annie (Annabella Sciorra) are a happy couple who suffer the devastating loss of their children. Shortly afterwards Chris dies himself and goes to an afterlife, which turns out to be a surreal lush dreamworld that is a reflection of his wife's paintings (which deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects). While there Chris meets an &quot;angel&quot; (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who guides him through the transition. Meanwhile, back in the real world, Annie becomes unable to cope with all the pain and losses and takes her own life, sending her to Hell. Determined to rescue Annie from an eternity in damnation, Chris sets out to find her and re-establish their bond together.This movie could have easily been a masterpiece, with such a great cast, excellent visual effects and production. However, there are two things which severely take away from its effectiveness. For one, the flashback style becomes tedious after a bit and interrupts the flow of the story. Many other reviewers have commented on this. It's a major drawback. And two, some scenes simply do not work. For example, when Chris arrives in Hell and begins maneuvering around the heads sticking out of the ground. This scene is done in a humorous way, seemingly for comic relief. It simply does not work and is majorly out of place. Comic relief isn't what should happen here.Aside from these flaws, &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; is an enlightening viewing experience and will stay with you long after you're finished watching it. It can be interpreted in many ways: a film about the possibility of life after death: a film about never-ending love: a film about affirming the beauty of life.

They seem to enjoy their blissful success, but it doesn't last very long. Both of their children are killed in a car crash, and now Chris and Annie are more disconnected than ever. One year later, Chris himself is killed in a car accident, and he is sent to heaven. There, he discovers his power to create anything that is produced in his own mind. Albert (Gooding, Jr.), his longtime mentor, guides him through the process.What Dreams May Come is a very beautiful film. Even if it's very different from the original novel (which I have never read, by the way), it does its job very well with its fantastic visuals. The heavenly landscapes created by the human mind are very creative: special effects are particularly stunning. The plot may be a little thin, but the most important elements in this film are the visuals. The acting is also satisfactory: Robin Williams plays yet another dramatic role without a hitch. He is completely convincing as a man who [almost] finds himself in harmony in heaven. Annabella Sciorra is lovely and memorable as Collins who is struggling to cope with her huge personal loss. Cuba Gooding Jr. gives a terrific performance as Albert: it's clear that he is enjoying himself with the role.What Dreams May Come is not perfect, but it's still a beautiful film.

Unfortunately, it was New Years Eve, and one prefers more uplifting fare, like watching the Marx Brothers' &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; for the hundredth time. After viewing this piece of tripe, even something starring Tom Green would have been preferable. (This is the only way I can really describe how bad this picture is!) Williams portrays a working-class hero who loses his children in a terrible traffic accident--along with himself. He journeys into an afterlife that changes like a fresh-painted canvas thrown into a New York street during a rainstorm. Williams' despondent wife sentences herself to the film's interpretation of hell by killing herself: a dark, empty house at the end of the world, apparently. His extra-worldly guide (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.) tries to stop Williams from making the journey to reclaim his wife's soul, but Robin will not be deterred. My main problem with the film was primarily its dull pacing, but other factors were all too apparent. For instance, the script was way too earnest and simplistic; it trivializes the afterlife as just a big circus, a place where God is not evident. That, to me, is truly scary. I'm sure New Age aficianados will nod their heads in close-mouthed assent at the Daliesque view of the afterWorld, but it is just too secular and sanitized to be real. I will admit that the special effects are fantastic (which is the reason I gave it one star), but these special effects do not a great film make (witness &quot;Star Wars, Episode I&quot;).

458623,A2JAAUES5NXG4Z,6305297525,Glen Boisseau Becker,"[1, 4]","In every sense of the word, this is the most romantic movie I can remember. That does not mean it is all sentimental hugs and kisses. It delves darkly into isolation and longing, death and despair; like an extended romantic poem, it presents some intensely subjective visions of a man's relationship to others and to the natural and supernatural worlds. In fact, as director Vincent Ward admits near the end of an excellent commentary track, this is nothing less than a New Age reworking of the ancient legend of Orpheus, who descended into the deepest depths of Hades' realm in hope of finding his beloved wife and restoring her to life and light. In this movie, however, the husband dies first and then begins his quest to be reunited with his love.Any review of this film--and any brief excerpt promoting it--must communicate a sense that it is visually dazzling, finding unprecedented techniques to create properly dreamlike visions of afterlife situations: The characters are immersed in settings vast and brilliant, inspired by a dozen painters from various eras of art history, brushstrokes and all. More surprising, perhaps, is the formidable acting of Annabella Sciorra and especially Robin Williams, communicating a whole palette of nuanced emotions in a noncomic role. (How could anyone complain of a lack of chemistry between them!) The movie's structure is unorthodox, with its strategically positioned, unexpectedly believable flashbacks, and throughout the journey, Michael Kamen's lush orchestral score sweeps us onward, adding hugely to the emotional experience. The surround sound is likewise spectacular.The weak link, if any, is the script. At best, it is properly unpredictable and sometimes exquisitely crafted (as in Chris's eulogy at the funeral of his teenage son). At other times it becomes unnecessarily vulgar or takes a few steps toward pretentiousness, which means that some viewers may be pardoned for finding individual moments off-putting or vaguely silly. All the same, we feel a bit cheated when an occasional line is hard to hear clearly on first viewing--for instance, because of Max von Sydow's accent. Though his relatively brief performance as a rather grumpy spiritual ""tracker"" is too understated and matter-of-fact for my taste, old von Sydow does get one of the best moments, when he dramatically warns our hero that the real danger of Hell is not physical torment but losing one's sanity and, by implication, one's soul. And if this film succeeds in provoking some fresh thoughts and feelings about all our preconceptions regarding life after death, surely that in itself is a triumph.As a bonus feature, the DVD includes an early, alternative version of the movie's final two scenes (with their postproduction aspects not fully polished). I have a slight preference for this original ending, though I might have left its last two minutes on the cutting-room floor. While it presents a different, more explicit, more complex picture of what lies ahead for the two soul mates, it does not drastically change the feeling or message of the movie. We might also recognize that the theatrically released ending, though sometimes dismissed as overly ""cute,"" does a neater job of bringing the story full circle.(There is one slight problem with the DVD, as both the trailers and the alternative ending have been vertically squeezed to an aspect ratio of nearly 3:1, making the actors appear fatter than they are. By contrast, the feature film is presented with an aspect ratio a bit narrower than the advertised 2.35:1, making us wonder whether the extreme left and right edges of the image have been chopped off.)At a time when virtually every Hollywood product steals ideas from countless films that came before, _What Dreams May Come_ is genuinely original and unique, not to say profoundly beautiful. It may appeal to the same audience as other modern ""love stronger than death"" movies such as _Defending Your Life_ and _Just Like Heaven_, yet it is more serious and far more ambitious in its aims than those two. Connoisseurs of classic international cinema may observe some thematic connections with the works of Jean Cocteau, or may note that Vincent Ward and his team capture some of Powell and Pressburger's creative excitement about exploiting Technicolor in the service of a surreal spirit. More simply, _What Dreams May Come_ does what movies ought to do but rarely achieve: instead of merely telling a story, it helps us see the world in a new way, through *moving* visual images that no

458626,A2FONFYLZNNN3Q,6305297525,Greg Hunter,"[1, 2]","I will be perfectly honest ... with myself.I am a huge fan of Robin Williams' work, and I found him sympathetic enough that I found a kind of chemistry between the characters of Christy and Annie that was deeper than on-screen sexual destiny.  I completely bought into the more mature and engaging chemistry of two people who have shared some of the most important, most wonderful, and most painful experiences life can offer.  Add to this that the actors who play the children are gifted in bringing us around to liking them and being concerned over what bothers them.  There are only two role left, well, one actually...but I don't want to ruin that little tweak.  Suffice it to say that I am ever impressed by Cuba Gooding, Jr's emotional range and depth and his remarkable ability to share his outstanding interpretation of his character with us, and as for Max Von Sydow?  Who else can be so charming, strong, fatherly, and somehow frightening all at once?  For many of us, he will ever be the iconic ""old priest"" -- Father Merin from a little movie that never quite gives up its hold on #1 on the list of scariest movies ever made.So that's the technical stuff.  Now for the honesty.It is possible that this film is emotionally manipulative, and I know some critics that denounce such exhibits of film making prowess as ""cheesy,"" ""predictable,"" and ""pushy.""  Twenty years ago, Robin starred in another emo machine called Dead Poets Society.  Again, critics who have not the talent to elicit more than cynicism panned the film because it succeeded in creating an emotional response.  Tell me Romeo & Juliet is anything but a calculated tear-jerker.  Shall we give Shakespeare one star?  So what's it all add up to?  Simply this honest statement:  I've not cried at a film like this since Dead Poets.  That film I cried at as a child beginning his first year of teaching.

The acting is too restrained to  be called good, and only adds to the overwhelming sense of boredom this  movie creates. The visuals are sometimes beautiful, often overdone, never  really necessary, and most of the time not even very interesting. Robin  Williams and Annabella Sciorra are supposed to be soul mates, but there is  nothing special about their relationship to make you think that it can last  other than the script constantly reminding us (especially considering that  she's a manic depressive and always moody). Their existence is supposed to  have been sublime - but as I said, nothing about it seems worthy of the  title. The children (who die early on), were apparently so neglected and  felt so unloved by their parents that when they died they decided to be  other people whom they believe their father really did love or admire. (By  the way, those &quot;plot&quot; twists do not even manage to be passingly  interesting, only confusing and reminders that this movie will never end)  None of them are even likeable, the restrained performances do not help and  only increase your lack of involvement or interest in their lives (or  deaths. Whatever). This movie wanted to be good, god knows it tries  desperately - but in the end it is one cliched mess after one overly long  scene after yet another pointless flashback (as I said, the script has to  remind us that their love was perfect since we get no sense of it on our  own).

But when the movie strays so far from the actual story, it becomes problematic.While Matheson wove many abstract ideas through his story line, it still worked very well and helped me grasp the metaphysical ideas he was putting forth. I has certainly changed the way I view life and death: why we're here, where we've been, and where we're going. I have no problem recommending this book to anyone.After enjoying the book so much, I really looked forward to seeing how it translated to film.I was soundly disappointed. Not only did the characters change radically (the Neilson children die? Albert is Chris's son? Ann's a painter?), but several of the main principles were ignored (i.e suicides are condemned...forever?). To me it seemed as if the screenplay writers were saying, Film audiences aren't sophisticated enough to understand the book; let's dumb it down a bit and slap a happy ending on it.That's too bad. Film audiences not only missed some really interesting theological and metaphysical ideas, they also missed out an a darn good storyline.Was the message the same? Yes. The basic premise was there: heaven is a state of mind that continues after you pass on. But the similarities end there. And what was with the jabs at the Psychiatric profession?I honestly think Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra were good choices; they're great actors, but they were given a very weak screenplay to work with. Had they just gone ""by the book,"" they could have done just fine. Unfortunately, they came off as pale imitations of Matson's Chris and Ann.So if you liked the movie, great; it served its purpose as an entertainment vehicle. But if you're looking for something deeper, something that might change your outlook on life and death for the better, seriously, try the book.",2,"Yep, I Read The Book First",1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,2799,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'so', 'many', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'have', 'nice', 'message', 'happy', 'ending', 'many', 'points', 'put', 'forth', 'so', 'well', 'book', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'movie', 'technology', 'was', 'there', 'late', 'nineties', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'bizarre', 'painting', 'motif', 'was', 'chosen.Uh-oh', 'jerk', 'who', 'book', 'was', 'better', 'movie', 'know', 'know', 'when', 'storyline', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'paper', 'changed', 'so', 'radically', 'please', 'mass', 'audience', 'director', 'producers', 'felt', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'well', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'understatement', 'Many', 'times', 'course', 'movie', 'found', 'thinking', 'What', 'No', 'not', 'how', 'happened', 'Uh', ""'re"", 'missing', 'point', 'Yep', 'read', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'prior', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'extraordinary', 'piece', 'work', 'worthy', 'time', 'know', ""'ll"", 'always', 'have', 'group', 'people', 'book', 'was', 'better', 'movie', 'when', 'movie', 'strays', 'so', 'far', 'actual', 'story', 'problematic.While', 'Matheson', 'wove', 'many', 'abstract', 'ideas', 'story', 'line', 'still', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'helped', 'grasp', 'metaphysical', 'ideas', 'was', 'putting', 'forth', 'certainly', 'changed', 'way', 'view', 'life', 'death', 'why', ""'re"", 'here', 'where', ""'ve"", 'been', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'problem', 'recommending', 'book', 'anyone.After', 'enjoying', 'book', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'how', 'translated', 'film.I', 'was', 'soundly', 'disappointed', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'characters', 'change', 'radically', 'Neilson', 'children', 'die', 'Albert', 'Chris', 'son', 'Ann', 'painter', 'several', 'main', 'principles', 'were', 'ignored', 'i.e', 'suicides', 'are', 'condemned', 'forever', 'seemed', 'screenplay', 'writers', 'were', 'saying', 'Film', 'audiences', 'are', ""n't"", 'sophisticated', 'enough', 'understand', 'book', 'dumb', 'down', 'bit', 'slap', 'happy', 'ending', 'it.That', 'too', 'bad', 'Film', 'not', 'only', 'missed', 'really', 'interesting', 'theological', 'metaphysical', 'ideas', 'also', 'missed', 'out', 'darn', 'good', 'storyline.Was', 'message', 'same', 'Yes', 'basic', 'premise', 'was', 'there', 'heaven', 'state', 'mind', 'pass', 'similarities', 'end', 'there', 'what', 'was', 'jabs', 'Psychiatric', 'profession', 'honestly', 'think', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'were', 'good', 'choices', ""'re"", 'great', 'actors', 'were', 'given', 'very', 'weak', 'screenplay', 'work', 'Had', 'just', 'gone', 'book', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'just', 'fine', 'Unfortunately', 'came', 'off', 'pale', 'imitations', 'Matson', 'Chris', 'Ann.So', 'liked', 'movie', 'great', 'served', 'purpose', 'entertainment', 'vehicle', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'deeper', 'something', 'might', 'change', 'outlook', 'life', 'death', 'better', 'seriously', 'try', 'book']",What Dreams May Come VHS

The eye candy provided in the technique of oil-painting on film screen (newly developed for this movie) makes the film worth seeing by itself- it's one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen in my life (on- or off-screen). The metaphysics is unfortunately all over the map and very off-target, but I don't recommend going to the movies for good theology. The movie does have some very inspiring messages about the need for hope; without which we die. I appreciated the perspective that hell is where people go when they no longer have hope- it made the best sense I had ever seen of the idea that suicides would go to hell. The basis of depression is a lack of hope, and lack of hope at it's basis is sin- in the sense of the original Hebrew, meaning &quot;to miss the mark&quot;. God's best for us was to have hope- to trust, and to have, as the Greek defines the word, &quot;expectant Joy&quot;. As expressed in What Dreams, suicide is the ultimate expression of a lack of hope- in essence one is choosing to not trust God, and choosing to not be in the place of hope, but the place of despair. If we are designed for hope, and choose to deny that, we have denied the basis of all reality. Annie chooses depression, and so her world becomes what she desires, and what she can handle- a world without hope. hell. Because of it's treatment of hope and despair, I would recommend that if you are feeling depressed, see this movie.

I agree with one of the other reviewers. It could have been a fine TWILIGHT ZONE episode (maybe for the 1980s episodes), but stretching it out to feature length is like a pair of men's briefs whose elastic broke.

Anabella Sciorra is a an absolutely beautiful woman who was able to find her prince charming fairy tale type partner and then through accidental death loses him and finds herself unable to get past the grieving over her loss. Robin Williams is the character married to Anabella's character, and the film takes us through several channels of him discovering heaven to be quite different than he anticipated. Then this fantastic adventure of imagination and splendor includes Robin Williams deciding in his role to seek out what may or may not be conquerable regarding the experiences of heaven and hell. Normally I don't like extremely serious dramas about very wealthy people who are so successful in life, because of how hard I've worked at it myself and just never have found open doors for me. But I couldn't help getting caught up in this film because in my heart I still hope for that kind of love, that kind of commitment to be reciprocated in a loving relationship, and this film does a super job of challenging my attention and some of the elements of the writer's imagination are simply put, fascinating beyond anything I had seen before I viewed this film.

Not exactly a spoiler here, as we fast-forward into the future about 10-13 years when the children are in junior high and high school. But when Chris, magnificently portrayed by Robin Williams, is killed in a tragic accident himself four years after that devastating accident, it leaves a shattered Annie (Annabella Sciorra) behind, all alone and fragile. In a nutshell, she attempts to find solace in suicide, but this act of desperation and despair leaves her forever inaccessible to her family and Heaven, or so one would think...

That's a well deserved Oscar, because this film has some of the most beautiful visual effects and art direction I've ever seen put on screen before. Williams plays Chris Nielson who tells us how he met the love of his life, Annie (Annabella Sciorra, 'The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'). Chris and Annie get married and have two children...But their world is rocked when the two children die in a car accident. They return to their normal life, for the most part, but then Chris dies in a car accident leaving Annie alone. With a man named Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) to guide him, Chris begins to explore heaven which is of his own creation (he builds it from Annie's paintings); But then Annie commits suicide, which guarantees her eternal damnation in Hell. I know this sounds like a book/movie written by a religious fanatic, but this movie (and rightly so) doesn't even really touch down on the subject of religion. The movie, despite its beauty and wonderful performances, isn't a masterpiece. As far as visuals, it is for sure...But the story tends to drag and become dull. Williams and Sciorra hit all the right notes as the devastated couple and Gooding Jr. gives a joyous performance. Max Von Sydow ('Needful Things') is also great as The Tracker who helps lead Chris into Hell to find Annie. The movie's got a beautiful story and a wonderful (if not melancholy) ending, but it's more to be appreciated than enjoyed.GRADE: B",4,Visually Stunning,1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,1614,"['What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'based', 'novel', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'Robin', 'Williams', ""'Good"", 'Will', 'Hunting', 'won', '1998', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'well', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'film', 'most', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'effects', 'art', 'direction', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'put', 'screen', 'Williams', 'Chris', 'Nielson', 'who', 'how', 'met', 'love', 'life', 'Annie', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', ""'The"", 'Hand', 'Cradle', 'Chris', 'Annie', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'two', 'children', 'world', 'rocked', 'when', 'two', 'children', 'die', 'car', 'accident', 'return', 'normal', 'life', 'most', 'part', 'then', 'Chris', 'car', 'accident', 'leaving', 'Annie', 'alone', 'man', 'named', 'Albert', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'guide', 'Chris', 'explore', 'heaven', 'own', 'creation', 'Annie', 'paintings', 'then', 'Annie', 'commits', 'suicide', 'eternal', 'damnation', 'Hell', 'know', 'book/movie', 'written', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'movie', 'rightly', 'so', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'touch', 'down', 'subject', 'religion', 'movie', 'beauty', 'wonderful', 'performances', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'As', 'far', 'visuals', 'sure', 'story', 'drag', 'become', 'dull', 'Williams', 'Sciorra', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'devastated', 'couple', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'joyous', 'performance', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', ""'Needful"", 'Things', 'also', 'great', 'Tracker', 'who', 'lead', 'Chris', 'Hell', 'find', 'Annie', 'movie', 'got', 'beautiful', 'story', 'wonderful', 'not', 'melancholy', 'ending', 'more', 'be', 'appreciated', 'enjoyed.GRADE', 'B']",What Dreams May Come VHS

I'm withholding a star for it's SciFi-Channel-esque seperation between audiance and characters. This movie was well placed for production style on the SciFi channel, but the content of the message and the effective portrayal of heaven, hell, and the unusual and fantastically beautiful bond between the characters was quite effective, if once in a while a little dry. For me, the moderate dryness of some of the near-monologue descriptive style of the script was made up for by the creativity of the message. While this might have been done better in a ""version 2"" with a more ""blockbuster"" attitude and a less ""pristine clean"" look we're seeing from the boomers trying to appeal to the Gen-Y's, I was positively thrilled to see someone writing down and acting out this version of the afterlife. For me the story of the characters' struggle was no more or less a tearjerker than the theological views being described. The theology alone makes the movie well worth watching. Robin Williams' brilliance shines in this venue, even though the combination threatens to be too lighthearted or a little too SciFi-Channel-shallow.This very sweet story of transcendental love is well worth watching, but by doing so you will run the risk of positively adoring it!I have a second perspective, however, which must be emphasized. The hair! This movie has some seriously top-of-the-line Bob Haircut content! Whoever chose and styled Annabella Sciorra's hair truly knows the beauty of the Bob, and in this case the Pageboy!

If you're the type of person who is impressed with the likes of ""The Celestine Prophecy"" you'll probably love this. Unfortunately, if you're a cinemaphile who wants something like a plot, witty dialogue, and all the other trimmings of a ""great"" film, you'd best look elsewhere.WDMC was very uneven, with the first 45 minutes or so crawling by, and the last act a hurried rush. I quickly lost interest in the film for the first half, as the admittedly impressive visuals became sensory overload and actually wore out their welcome. I was keenly aware that the ""story"" was bare-bones, and suspected that this was just a vehicle to show off ILM's latest advances. What passes for ""plot conflict"" was introduced way too late, and was resolved too quickly, and too unsatisfactorly: we get the ""happy Hollywood schlock ending"" where everything works out for the best, but I was at a loss to figure out just HOW that happened. Maybe the book gets into it better, but the happy ending was jarringly forced with no discernable explanation, and actually struck me as the result of test screening polls where the audience wanted everything to end just peachy.The ""plot"" is gause-thin, and since I minored in Theology, I almost immediately recognized it as an unambitious lifting of Emanuel Swedenborg's theory that ""the afterlife is what you make of it"" -- with a few variations thrown in to force a plot conflict.I haven't read the book, so I can't compare/contrast the film to that -- a few reviews said the book is better, or at least fleshes out the movie. I defer to them on that, but based on the movie itself, have absolutely no desire to track down a copy.Although I'm sure this final comment will draw the ire of this film's proponents, I honestly see this film appealing to only two types of people: drug users looking for something pretty to stare at, and New Age-types wanting a feel good/""I'm secure"" type of film.

458679,AKZ1Q9S0Z3G6V,6305297525,"Matthew Perri ""Matthew Perri""","[5, 12]","Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding, Jr. got lucky at the Oscars one year. So, the director of &quot;Dreams&quot; decides that he'll get them together to make this film.All right. That's fine.Then, you have to get your  hands on a &quot;great&quot; script, drafted from a novel by...Richard  Matheson...old Twilight Zone writer, wrote &quot;Duel&quot;, &quot;The  Legend of Hell House&quot;, &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, and the great  &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;...You're rolling along now.Now to shoot  your movie. Give your audience something to stare at so they won't get  bored with all the droning-on about meta-physics and what-not. Ooooo...look  at the pretty colors...and that wierd bird-thing...that's basically it,  folks. It's pretty all right. Pretty shallow.In fact, the only character  with ANY depth whatsoever in this film is Chris, played by Robin Williams,  in a film that is essentially, 1998's &quot;Soldier&quot; without the  violence and with a brighter set. It's really unfortunate, too. This film  had the potential to be great. And on a visual level, it is...don't get me  wrong! In fact, it IS a shoe-in for Art Direction at this year's Oscars and  has a run for its money against &quot;Armageddon&quot; for Visual  Effects.But there's really not much more than that. We're supposed to  see the long-dead family dog running across the flower-field(which looks  like a Robert Frost poem after five doses of Crack) and cry because Chris  sees him again. But Vincent Ward(director of &quot;Map of the Human  Heart&quot;) feels that we really don't have to know much about such  characters, and thus, kills them off as he sees fit. At least THE DOG had  more flesh than Chris's psycho wife, Annie. And when he DOES kill them, you  sit there and wait for the funeral to end, because you really never knew  the deceased that well and they're so one-dimensional anyhow, that you  really didn't care to meet them in the first place. That's part of the  reason that you don't cry in this film. Even Robin Williams(in a  heart-tugging performance) almost feels to the audience, like an actor who  is improvising with zombies that can't think of what to say when he talks  to them. And the only really weepy parts are when we're force-fed the  slow-motion shots of funerals and crying flight attendants who just may or  may not be your family in disguise. Imagine, telling somebody that your son  sucked at football and that he wished he could teach him better before he  died, then all of the sudden...WHAMMO!!! The previously African-American  guy that was standing next to you is SUDDENLY YOUR SON. And that the flight  attendant you smiled at that you are talking to in Heaven suddenly becomes  YOUR DAUGHTER!!! And that the old guy who was taking you through Hell is  suddenly that African American guy who is your son...kinda...sorta...I  think... Why does everyone you know have to be in disguise? Why can't they  just come out and say, &quot;Dad, I missed you&quot;?And they said that  &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; was confusing. This makes that film easier  to understand than Sesame Street!Not much intensity is here either. You  expect an epic trip through hell and right as Chris is ready to face his  fear, we hit a flashback that lets us in on Chris's life; one of about  eighty-thousand that are sprinkled about this movie like too much spice.  Why couldn't we have known these things earlier? It not only throws the  viewer off, it ruins the pacing of the film.And &quot;Heaven&quot;  relies heavily on your beliefs. I believe in Heaven, but I don't believe in  a lot of the mind-crap that was fed to me from this movie. I have lost a  lot of people in my family, but I really don't believe that they're in  their own place, walking around some paint field. Then that means my father  is teaching a classroom of kids 24-7 and my grand-father is in some brothel  in World War 2, getting fed grapes by the clientele. Dante can say what he  wants, but I don't agree with his fundamentalism. Hell is creative and all,  but there's really no punishment for the banished souls. Unless some guy  from Heaven just happens to be trying to rescue his wife and accidentally  ends up walking on your face(see the film and you'll get it).I don't  know.

But it's even better when he does a more serious role, a step away from what he's normally known for. (See also One Hour Photo.) This film is the kinda film I don't think most people would be interested in, but it's worth a look, just to see the interpretations of Heaven & Hell. And a fabulously moving performance by Annabella Sciorra.What I didn't like about this film was the interpretation of Heaven. But each to their own I suppose. Everyone makes their 'own' Heaven apparently, and Chris (Robin Williams) ends up 'living' in his wife's paintings. What's cool is that if she adds to the painting, he sees it too. If she removes it, he sees that as well.It's a hard time for Annabella Sciorra's character, she loses her two children, and then four years later, loses her husband. (And how on earth did they make Robin's character look so YOUNG in some of the flashback scenes?! He looked similar to how he did in his Mork & Mindy days.) She ends up committing suicide, but suicides don't realise what they've done, and go to Hell. (She also looks much younger than she did in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, and has managed to find a good hairstylist, and makeup artist.)I much preferred the interpretation of Hell to Heaven for some strange reason. It wasn't stereotyped, like other films, with lots of flames, and a big red devil with a big red fork thing. It was very dark & just so different.You can really feel the chemistry between Annabella & Robin, their love for each other in the film is portrayed so strongly. It is the one film where true love lasts beyond life, and into the next. It almost makes you believe in it.It would be interesting to read a review from a person who doesn't believe in Heaven or Hell I think. I believe in one, but not the other. Kind of. But I'm just so grateful to the director for not doing a stereotypical view of Hell, as I thought it would have happened.

There are some startling effects and the use of light and color are breathtaking.  Michael Kamen's score is also lush and wonderful.  The movie, however, is definitely a mixed bag.  Starting off with enough tragedy to induce suicidal tendencies, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME offers us a view of the afterlife; it does reaffirm the power of love, but it also whitewashes the suicide issue, and its reincarnation ending is just too over the top for my personal tastes.  I also think the casting of Cuba Gooding Jr. was a big mistake; when we find out who he is, it's hard to really believe it.  Robin Williams is certainly more subdued than usual, but I couldn't help feeling his performance was more of a ""hey look at the comic actor playing a dramatic role.""  Annabella Sciorra fares much better, showing us the descent of her character and her ""redemption.""

If you're willing to go with the director on this journey, you will be rewarded.  This movie is visionary.  I sheepishly admit I cried my eyes out at several times.  I've never seen anything quite like this movie.  It's courageous.  It takes on the subject of death in a way no other movie has attempted.  The movie has shades of Jacob's Ladder at times, and a bit of Dark City in it's approach.  But at the same time it's both sweet and romantic.  I've had friends say that they just couldn't deal with the subject matter, and that's fine.  I found it fascinating.  Did I mention the visuals are stunning?  I'm a video editor by profession, and it takes a lot to make my jaw drop because I know how most of this stuff is done, and I was blown away.  But there's a depth here that goes beyond visuals.  Be prepared going in... it will challenge you.  I found the ending to be a bit...convenient.  I would have thought the ending more interesting if Ward had ended with Chris (Robin Williams) giving up his chance at eternity in heaven to spend eternity in hell with Alicia (Annabella Sciora), but I think someone thought it would be a harder sell at the box office.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Max Von Sydow shine.  The alternate ending on this film (provided on the DVD) was even stranger.  It gives a nod to 2001: A Space Odyssey.

The dialogue that comes out of his mouth is absolute truth!In our world culture, men are taught not to feel anything that is less than wonderful.- with the exception of anger. The sad result is the frustration of inability to connect with others, especially the opposite sex, emotionally.When Robin's character decides it's better to live in hell with the one he loves than live in heaven without her, he takes the plunge, the risk of being doomed to hell forever, only to find that that is the only way his wife can FEEL his love, which empowers her to come out of her hell.Oh if every man could watch that film and wake up to the meaning and abiltiy to connect with others on an emotional level, they would find that they can leave hell and enter into heaven in their relationships.

Then, on a mild spring morning, an auto accident kills both son and daughter. Subsequently, Williams is killed in a freak car pile-up incident, and finds himself in heaven, with Gooding, Jr. and Chao as his angelic guides.He must save his painter/wife from the twisted (but--along with paradise--technically stunning piece of movie magic) hell that she has created in her suicide.Ward's direction throughout all, surpasses even that of James Caneron's, even if for only ""Dreams."" One cannot watch this heartfelt film enough times, trust me. Williams' computer-riden paradise (actually his favorite painting by his wife, of the spot of thier first meeting) is a big highlight, but the entire film is a rollercoaster through an abstract heaven and hell that's truly unforgettable.Probably one of ""Dream""'s most underappreciated facets is it's score, provided by master Michael Kamen, and adapted from a tune by the little-known innovational band Sigura Rose. It is Kamen's glorious thematic scoring that brings the truest vibrance to the love story and characters of ""What Dreams May Come.""Finally, the supporting cast provides stellar performances (look for Von Syndow as a reincarnated ex-colleague of Willams' character), even the children. ""Dream""'s reuniting ending, I have to say is probably the reason this film brings me to flat-out bawling-like-a-baby, every time I see it.

One year later, Chris and Annie are still trying to work through it. If things couldn't get any worse for Annie, Chris is also killed in an automobile accident as well. With her husband and two children gone, Annie does not want to go on living and kills herself. When Chris goes to Heaven, he is confronted by a younger version of his best friend Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr)who explains to him that he died and that he can make Heaven whatever he wants it to be. Unfortunately, he also reveals that Annie has gone to Hell for committing suicide. Chris refuses to accept this, and becomes determined to bring Annie back so that he can spend all of eternity with his wife and two kids.There have been many films that deal with the afterlife. However, I feel that What Dreams May Come did the best job illustrating the afterlife and what it can be like. The special effects are amazing in this film when it comes to showcasing Heaven and Hell. The overall story is extremely powerful because of Chris's determination to save his wife Annie. The film shows that the bond between soul mates is hard to break. This is also an extremely emotional film as well. I was bawling like a baby througout he film, and I rarely cry when watching a movie. All of the main actors - Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Max Von Syndow do a fantastic job in their roles.Overall, What Dreams May Come is an amazing film. All of the actors involved are wonderful, the story is very powerful and emotional, and the special effects create a stunning and creative version of the afterlife.

I would actually give the movie 4.5 stars but I rounded up.  The movie gets 5 stars for visual/scenary.  I wish I could give more.  It is artistically stunning.  In addition, I give the acting 5 stars.  Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra are believable and well cast for this movie.  The  chemistry between them is right on.  I give the directing 5 stars.  I would have like to see this set live.  All you can say is WOW!  The heaven and hell scene is amazingly well done.  At times I asked ""How did they do that?""  Some scenes are pretty freakin' Cool.  But please keep in mind,  this is a movie.  It has great values and is safe for most of the family (the hell scenes might be too much for little ones) but this movie is not biblically based.  The author believes in reincarnation, finding your soulmate, personal heaven and eternal damnation.  Don't expect to see Jesus, but do expect to see great artwork, great entertainment and possibly even shed a tear.  There are some very deep parts to this movie, and it leaves a lot to your imagination.  At times you have to put scenes together to understand the flashes from past to present, but the movie does flow very well.  This is a very good movie for its entertainment value.  It has believable characters, it focuses on personal choices, following your heart, breaking your heart, losing a loved one, saving a loved on, family bonds where no one is perfect and in doing whatever it takes to get your loved ones back.  I am not going to give away the ending, but Robin makes the right choice.  Cuba Gooding Jr is also in this movie.  It is not his best work.  He plays an Angel.  Well ... a reincarnated angel.

But I also think very highly of Robin Williams, having enjoyed his performances in GOOD MORNING VIETNAM and DEAD POETS  SOCIETY(and I'm a closet MORK AND MINDY fan!), so I watched it with her,  and I was surprised that I ended up enjoying this movie so much! The story  tells of a man named Chris, played by the brilliant Robin Williams, who  dies in a road accident and goes to Heaven, which is his own personal  Heaven, in one of his wife's unfinished paintings. His wife Annie(Annabella  Sciorra), who has suffered the loss of their children with him in the past,  is so devastated she kills herself and descends into Hell. Cuba Gooding Jnr  plays a jovial Heaven 'guide', who shows Chris around and what he can  create for himself, but this stiry proves that he loves Annie so much he  would, quite literally, endure hell to be with her again. This movie had it  all - spectacular visual effects depicting heaven and hell, brilliant  performances all round(Robin Williams makes any movie he does worth  watching, with the possible exception of that turkey called NINE MONTHS)  and a story that will make you think about life in a different angle. The  inverted cathedral images of Hell were an imaginative touch, along with the  sea of faces and Max Von Sydow as a kind of dark man, or tracker, leading  Williams into Hell.

458696,AP50P603W4BA7,6305297525,"Ms. H. Sinton ""dragondrums""","[5, 7]","This is a typical Robin Williams film, sentimental to the extreme which is fine if that's what you are expecting. If you are expecting a true rendition of Richard Matheson's book then forget it. The only similarity to the book is that Chris Nielsen, the main character, dies and discovers there is life after death. From thereon in the story differs wildly. The book focuses more on Chris's voyage of discovery in the afterlife and on his being drawn to his wife whose grieving is preventing him from fully letting go of his earthly life. The film sees the poor woman left grieving for not only Chris, but her two children who have been killed in a car crash.All that aside, is this a good film? It depends on your expectations. The effects are excellent and the colour rendition of `heaven' is truly amazing if somewhat Dali like in its surrealism. Heaven is portrayed a place from a renaissance painting. Hell is shown as a dark and despairing place, pretty much as you would expect but again filmed with flair and a brilliant eye for detail. Chris's guide through the afterlife is played, with style, by Cuba Gooding Junior. Visually this film is a feast but the storyline will leave most viewers depressed and drained. It isn't a comfortable movie to watch. Unlike the book which, although very sad at times, portrays a more positive note, the movie leaves you with a feeling of  desperation that so much tragedy could happen to one family.It is probably worth viewing this film at least once as long as you are not depressed at the time...just keep tissues by your side.

458700,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,6305297525,Nicholas Carroll,"[37, 40]","When I first saw this film in 1998, I was horrified because it was so different from the novel I had just read.  I wanted to see a film more faithful to the novel and the beauty and awe I felt when I read it.  This is not that movie.I decided to watch this film again on its own merits.  I haven't read the novel for years, so I'm able to see this film with fresh eyes, and judge it on its own merits.  Its not the novel, and maybe someday there will be a film that is a closer representation of the novel, but this film presents the director's vision and still provides excellent insights into the afterlife.  For that, its worth watching and owning.This film is visually stunning as they recreated a world as one might expect if a person lived in a painting, or a place that resembled a painting.  Having seen some actual works by Renoir, I know the feeling of being transported into another realm on the basis of a painting.  This film does it perfectly.  The symbology and recurring patterns (sailboats, for example) work exceptionally well.The biggest changes made from the novel is that this film is about a family's connection in life and the afterlife, and the focus is on the relationships between husband and wife, father and son, and father and daughter.  Robin Williams plays Chris Nielson, who meets his soulmate in Italy, and they marry and have two children, who die in a tragic car accident.  The wife, played by the exceptional Annabella Sciorra, is institutionalized after the tragedy, and does get better...until her husband also dies in a freak accident.  He finds himself in heaven and she's left to grieve alone, which is a burden too heavy for her to overcome.  In heaven, Chris meets a few people who explain how the afterlife works (and its so much better in the novel) and then he's hit with the news that his wife had killed herself and was now in a hell of her own creation.  He decides to brave the dangers of hell (because one can lose one's mind being surrounded by tormented souls and the thoughts they carry) to rescue her.  This is a story of a love so deep, that a man is willing to give up heaven to be with the woman he loves in her self created hell.  Amazing!This dvd also includes the original ending, and while it was more faithful to the novel (and one I would've preferred), I also know why they changed it to the ""cutesy ending"" we see.  Unfortunately, it downplays the way reincarnation supposedly works (the original ending was more realistic) and presents it as some adorable, Americanized version of reincarnation...which is more fantasy than reality.  However, imperfect this film is, I give it four stars because of the importance of such a film in bringing any vision of the afterlife to public consciousness.  There are not enough films like this being made and I'm one who would love to see more films about heaven and the afterlife (besides ""Defending Your Life"", ""Ghost"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Chances Are"", ""Made in Heaven"" to name a few).  This is one of the better ones out there...but the novel is so much better.  If you haven't seen this film or read the novel, I recommend seeing the film first then reading the novel.  If you do it the other way, you run the risk like me...of having such a beautiful vision in your head and being disappointed that the film is nothing like your vision.  This film deserves to be seen on its own merits.  It is simply visually beautiful and if the afterlife is as the film presents, we really do have nothing to fear if we love others and treat them by the Golden Rule.",4,A spiritual film for the senses,1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,3563,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', '1998', 'was', 'horrified', 'was', 'so', 'different', 'novel', 'had', 'just', 'read', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'more', 'faithful', 'novel', 'beauty', 'awe', 'felt', 'when', 'read', 'not', 'movie.I', 'decided', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'own', 'merits', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'years', ""'m"", 'able', 'see', 'film', 'fresh', 'eyes', 'judge', 'own', 'merits', 'not', 'novel', 'maybe', 'someday', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'closer', 'representation', 'novel', 'film', 'director', 'vision', 'still', 'excellent', 'insights', 'afterlife', 'worth', 'watching', 'owning.This', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'recreated', 'world', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'person', 'lived', 'painting', 'place', 'resembled', 'painting', 'Having', 'seen', 'actual', 'works', 'Renoir', 'know', 'feeling', 'being', 'transported', 'realm', 'basis', 'painting', 'film', 'perfectly', 'symbology', 'recurring', 'patterns', 'sailboats', 'example', 'work', 'exceptionally', 'well.The', 'biggest', 'changes', 'made', 'novel', 'film', 'family', 'connection', 'life', 'afterlife', 'focus', 'relationships', 'husband', 'wife', 'father', 'son', 'father', 'daughter', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Chris', 'Nielson', 'who', 'soulmate', 'Italy', 'marry', 'have', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'die', 'tragic', 'car', 'accident', 'wife', 'played', 'exceptional', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'institutionalized', 'tragedy', 'get', 'better', 'husband', 'also', 'freak', 'accident', 'heaven', 'left', 'grieve', 'alone', 'burden', 'too', 'heavy', 'overcome', 'heaven', 'Chris', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'explain', 'how', 'afterlife', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'novel', 'then', 'hit', 'news', 'wife', 'had', 'killed', 'was', 'now', 'hell', 'own', 'creation', 'brave', 'dangers', 'hell', 'one', 'can', 'lose', 'one', 'mind', 'being', 'surrounded', 'tormented', 'souls', 'thoughts', 'carry', 'rescue', 'story', 'love', 'so', 'deep', 'man', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'heaven', 'be', 'woman', 'self', 'created', 'hell', 'Amazing', 'dvd', 'also', 'original', 'ending', 'was', 'more', 'faithful', 'novel', 'one', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'also', 'know', 'why', 'changed', 'cutesy', 'ending', 'see', 'Unfortunately', 'way', 'reincarnation', 'supposedly', 'original', 'ending', 'was', 'more', 'realistic', 'adorable', 'Americanized', 'version', 'reincarnation', 'more', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'However', 'imperfect', 'film', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'importance', 'such', 'film', 'bringing', 'vision', 'afterlife', 'public', 'consciousness', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'films', 'being', 'made', ""'m"", 'one', 'who', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'films', 'heaven', 'afterlife', 'Defending', 'Life', 'Ghost', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Chances', 'Are', 'Made', 'Heaven', 'name', 'few', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'there', 'novel', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'read', 'novel', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'film', 'first', 'then', 'reading', 'novel', 'do', 'other', 'way', 'run', 'risk', 'having', 'such', 'beautiful', 'vision', 'head', 'being', 'disappointed', 'film', 'nothing', 'vision', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'own', 'merits', 'simply', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'afterlife', 'film', 'presents', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'nothing', 'fear', 'love', 'others', 'treat', 'Golden', 'Rule']",What Dreams May Come VHS

It is magnificent, but without being overwhelming. Yet, I think that I would like it even if the camera work and effects were not so beautifully done. This is because I also find it the most thoughtful and mature film on the topic of the afterlife to ever come out of Hollywood.The concept that we have to gradually overcome our preconceptions after death has the ring of truth to it. The metaphor of the art-loving Chris Nielsen seeing the afterlife as a great expressionistic canvas- until his guide rips through it to show him the next level is quite well done. This seeing beyond appearances and preconceptions to recognise our fellow beings as they really are is also quite profound. Personally, I enjoyed the fact that the deceased family dog seemed to be the only one that had no trouble adapting to his new surroundings.Yet, this isn't a piece of new-age mind candy. Nielsen's wife's decent into despair after his death, followed by his epic quest into the depths of ""hell"" to rescue her, is positively mythological.

458706,A35TN5YGURE6IV,6305297525,"""oxzo""","[5, 7]","One of the most interesting things about this film is the place it has in the career of actor Robin Williams.  For those who maybe don&#65533;t remember his television show and his early movies he was more or less strictly a comedic actor.  This movie goes so far beyond the type of work he was doing early in his career in terms of the meaning and topic that it is really pretty wild.  He has managed in this film to break so far out of the type cast situation he was in early on that it in and of itself is remarkable.This is a film about heaven and hell and the nature of the afterlife.  This film while it does have some funny parts also has some very sad parts because you can only wonder what it would feel like to die and realize your wife who you loved more than any other has gone to hell.  What&#65533;s worse you are partly to blame and she is the only one missing from your family in heaven including as I recall the dog.The portrayal of the afterlife is really pretty cool with heaven being a beautiful and fun place and hell being dark, ugly, and despairing.  Would you willfully reject heaven and descend into hell to save your spouse if you are separated in the afterlife?  That is a pretty hard question for people of faith given what is generally taught regarding the demons, pain, suffering, despair, and agonies associated with Satan.  It is this very &#65533;what if&#65533; situation that confronts Williams.This is a fantastic tale for adults if you ask me but frankly it&#65533;s a little too deep and dark in places to be appropriate for younger members of the family.  If you watch it with kids be prepared to explain why the mommy went to hell for committing suicide in ending her life in despair.  If your kids are ready to deal with the serious questions regarding the afterlife then it&#65533;s really not a graphic violent depiction of hell but rather a nightmare come true depiction in which every essence of existence is dark, dirty, decayed, and destitute.  No one is on fire or picked on by evil beings in a physical sense it is psychological torture.I really like this film because quite frankly I found it to be incredibly original in it&#65533;s concept and execution.  I can think of no other movie really like it except perhaps Jacobs Ladder but this takes a step beyond it in that Williams starts out in a really beautiful setting when he dies and then descends into the lake of fire to try to save his wife because his love for her is so strong.Yes it is a metaphysical storyline and yet it is about love and making the ultimate sacrifice of one&#65533;s eternal fate for the love of another.  I&#65533;ll not tell you the end but I will say there are things that you may not expect.I saw this on a rental but it is one of the select titles I myself will be buying for my library because it is something I could watch periodically with friends and family.  I recommend it to people of faith, of a spiritual persuasion, and for those who like stunning special effects because it is in my opinion a very special movie with an apocalyptic overtone of sorts (if you see it and are aware of it at any rate).Would you have the courage to sacrifice yourself for another in the end?",5,Heaven and Hell Choices In The Afterlife,1027814400,"07 28, 2002",2002,3216,"['One', 'most', 'interesting', 'things', 'film', 'place', 'career', 'actor', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'maybe', 'don', '65533', 't', 'remember', 'television', 'show', 'early', 'movies', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'strictly', 'comedic', 'actor', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'type', 'work', 'was', 'doing', 'early', 'career', 'terms', 'meaning', 'topic', 'really', 'pretty', 'wild', 'managed', 'film', 'break', 'so', 'far', 'type', 'cast', 'situation', 'was', 'early', 'remarkable.This', 'film', 'heaven', 'hell', 'nature', 'afterlife', 'film', 'have', 'funny', 'parts', 'also', 'very', 'sad', 'parts', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'feel', 'die', 'realize', 'wife', 'who', 'loved', 'more', 'other', 'gone', 'hell', 'What', '65533', 's', 'worse', 'are', 'partly', 'blame', 'only', 'one', 'missing', 'family', 'heaven', 'including', 'recall', 'dog.The', 'portrayal', 'afterlife', 'really', 'pretty', 'cool', 'heaven', 'being', 'beautiful', 'fun', 'place', 'hell', 'being', 'dark', 'ugly', 'despairing', 'Would', 'willfully', 'reject', 'heaven', 'descend', 'hell', 'save', 'spouse', 'are', 'separated', 'afterlife', 'pretty', 'hard', 'question', 'people', 'faith', 'given', 'what', 'generally', 'taught', 'regarding', 'demons', 'pain', 'suffering', 'despair', 'agonies', 'associated', 'Satan', 'very', '65533', 'what', '65533', 'situation', 'Williams.This', 'fantastic', 'tale', 'adults', 'ask', 'frankly', '65533', 's', 'little', 'too', 'deep', 'dark', 'places', 'be', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'members', 'family', 'watch', 'kids', 'be', 'prepared', 'explain', 'why', 'mommy', 'went', 'hell', 'committing', 'suicide', 'ending', 'life', 'despair', 'kids', 'are', 'ready', 'deal', 'serious', 'questions', 'regarding', 'afterlife', 'then', '65533', 's', 'really', 'not', 'graphic', 'violent', 'depiction', 'hell', 'rather', 'nightmare', 'come', 'true', 'depiction', 'essence', 'existence', 'dark', 'dirty', 'decayed', 'destitute', 'one', 'fire', 'picked', 'evil', 'beings', 'physical', 'sense', 'psychological', 'torture.I', 'really', 'film', 'quite', 'frankly', 'found', 'be', 'incredibly', 'original', '65533', 's', 'concept', 'execution', 'can', 'think', 'other', 'movie', 'really', 'perhaps', 'Jacobs', 'Ladder', 'step', 'Williams', 'out', 'really', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'when', 'then', 'lake', 'fire', 'try', 'save', 'wife', 'love', 'so', 'strong.Yes', 'metaphysical', 'storyline', 'yet', 'love', 'making', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'one', '65533', 's', 'eternal', 'fate', 'love', '65533', 'not', 'tell', 'end', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'things', 'may', 'not', 'expect.I', 'saw', 'rental', 'one', 'select', 'titles', 'myself', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'library', 'something', 'could', 'watch', 'periodically', 'friends', 'family', 'recommend', 'people', 'faith', 'spiritual', 'persuasion', 'who', 'stunning', 'special', 'effects', 'opinion', 'very', 'special', 'movie', 'apocalyptic', 'overtone', 'sorts', 'see', 'are', 'aware', 'rate', 'have', 'courage', 'sacrifice', 'end']",What Dreams May Come VHS

458709,A2S1TF4OD00K53,6305297525,"P. G. Keller ""Packerfan75""","[3, 19]","If you want to know about Heaven and Hell, it's all in the Bible. God has already given us a glimpse of both and this movie isn't even close.The main issue I have with this movie is that the message, theme and core story of the film are not original and created ideas of the author and script writers. The author didn't just sit down and think up the idea of God, the afterlife, Heaven and Hell and the ways to these places. God has provided us with all of this information in the Bible and most people know this. God tells us of these places and how anyone will enter into either domain. Apparently, the author disagrees with what God has told us and has taken the and descriptions of those places and twisted them into his own vision. Which makes this whole idea a blatant lie, contradiction and attack on God's word. The author and movie makers knew this and did it anyway. This is why I diagree with the whole concept of the story and film. This also makes reviewing the actors performances, cinematography, graphics, and music score moot.In this movie, you can make your own Heaven, and God has no name as not to offend anyone (political correctness strikes again). He's portrayed as ""somewhere up there"", even in His own Kingdom. The name Jesus isn't even spoken, even though He sits at the right hand of the Father and is Lord, king and judge of all. I thank God that this idea of Heaven isn't even close to the real one. People just hang around or fly around and create their own customized heaven, nonsense. People are also exactly the same in this heaven as they are on earth. Theres pain, anger and swearing in this idea of heaven. You can even take God's name in vain there!!! I don't think so. God's Heaven is peace and joy for those who have called upon the name of Jesus Christ as Lord before death. In the movie, everyone is totally consumed with their own feelings for each other and there's no love for God which should be the greatest and strongest love of all. There's also the option of reincarnation, which is also not Biblical at all. Why would you ever want to come back here anyway after you were already in Heaven? The real Heaven that is, not this boring and self indugent one of the movie. The Bible also makes it clear that no one can cross over from Heaven to Hell or Hell to Heaven. This movie disreagards that too and makes that possible. God gave man dominion over the earth, but Heaven is His.Which brings us to the other side, Hell. This movie also directly contradicts the Bible by saying, ""the real Hell is your life gone wrong"". No, the real Hell was made for the devil and his demons. Hell is also a place for those who've rejected Jesus Christ as Lord. God's word clearly states that there is only one unforgivable sin, and that is to blaspheme the Holy Spirit, which means to reject Jesus Christ as Lord and make God out to be a liar by denying the truth.  The movie also says, ""Hell isn't all fire and torment"". That's also wrong, God has already told us that it is. All of our senses are intact and there is searing heat, pain and knowledge of where you are and that you put yourself there by rejecting God's way of salvation through His Son Jesus Christ. The movie also allows for those in Hell to go to Heaven. Wrong. Judgement is final and eternal. God is in control. But the movie yet again wants man to be in control. The Hell in this movie is a total joy and paradise compared to the real Hell. In the real Hell, there is no moment of peace, even to sit and be depressed. No one returns and all is ultimate suffering and torment. But the worst of it all is being separated from God forever and knowing that you could have accepted the free offer of salvation through Jesus Christ.This movie portrays secular society's false sense of hope that we're all basically good, without need of salvation and that as long as we don't kill anyone, we're all going to Heaven. It's just not true. We're all sinners, just the same and all in need of salvation. God doesn't send us to Hell, without Jesus, we're already on our way there. We're already condemned and sitting on death row. Jesus bore the sins of the world on His own shoulders so that we may forgiven and be freed from condemnation. We can be saved if we'll just accept what He did. Repent, call upon his name and ask Him into your life as Lord and Savior. You can know God now and His great and abounding love for you. Now is the time of salvation, life can end for anyone of us at anytime. Call upon the name of the Lord while He may be found.Jesus said, ""Trust in God, trust also in me. In my Fathers house are many mansions, if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you. I will come back and take you with me that you also may be where I am. I am the way the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me"". (John 14:1-6)Because God so loved the world, He sacrificed His only Son Jesus Christ, and all those who repent and call on the name of the Lord Jesus will be saved. God didn't send His Son into the world to condemn it but that the world through him may be saved.

458711,AXV9GS0TMSVW,6305297525,Poor Napoleon,"[10, 13]","The movie plays out like an ode to Dante, finding Robin Williams reaching to the depths of hell to find his wife after she commits suicide.  A couple things really grabbed me about this movie.  One thing was Robin Williams performance and his growing depth as an actor.  In the beginning, before he dies, he is visibally a scarred, emotionally conflicted person because of his childrens' deaths.  He plays the character with such warmth and down to earth sadness that is almost unmatched.  It's clearly a result of award winning work on Good Will Hunting.The second thing that grabbed was the undeniably beautiful visuals.  They almost play with the senses by showing us the beauty of heaven in what's probably the best description ever captured on screen.  Then, we're taken on a journey through hell.  It's unspeakably dark and unspeakably sad.  I was moved as Robin Williams went through the pit of all the condemned people and then as he confronted his wife.  The scenes are dar, emotional, and disturbing.The movie's only deterrents I think come from the ending.  I wasn't really moved by the ending.  Two endings are offered on this disc and the one that they went with is the superior one while the alternate ending seemed to be too dramatic and too sad.  I guess from a theological perspective, however, the ending that was used didn't work for me.  You didn't know whether to feel happy or sad and you didn't feel that it was the right way for things to end.  It felt forced and a bit uninspired where the rest of the film was drenched in emotional energy.Despite it's shortcomings, however, Robing Williams's performance, the amazing visuals, and depth of emotion create a pretty compelling and original piece of work.",3,Happiness is hard to come by in the beautiful sorrowful film,1017014400,"03 25, 2002",2002,1728,"['movie', 'out', 'ode', 'Dante', 'finding', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'reaching', 'depths', 'hell', 'find', 'wife', 'suicide', 'couple', 'things', 'really', 'grabbed', 'movie', 'One', 'thing', 'was', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'performance', 'growing', 'depth', 'actor', 'beginning', 'visibally', 'scarred', 'emotionally', 'conflicted', 'person', 'childrens', 'deaths', 'character', 'such', 'warmth', 'down', 'earth', 'sadness', 'almost', 'unmatched', 'clearly', 'result', 'award', 'winning', 'work', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting.The', 'second', 'thing', 'grabbed', 'was', 'undeniably', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'almost', 'play', 'senses', 'showing', 'beauty', 'heaven', 'what', 'probably', 'best', 'description', 'ever', 'captured', 'screen', 'Then', ""'re"", 'taken', 'journey', 'hell', 'unspeakably', 'dark', 'unspeakably', 'sad', 'was', 'moved', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'went', 'pit', 'condemned', 'people', 'then', 'confronted', 'wife', 'scenes', 'are', 'dar', 'emotional', 'disturbing.The', 'movie', 'only', 'deterrents', 'think', 'come', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'moved', 'ending', 'Two', 'endings', 'are', 'offered', 'disc', 'one', 'went', 'superior', 'one', 'alternate', 'ending', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'dramatic', 'too', 'sad', 'guess', 'theological', 'perspective', 'however', 'ending', 'was', 'used', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'feel', 'happy', 'sad', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'right', 'way', 'things', 'end', 'felt', 'forced', 'bit', 'uninspired', 'where', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'drenched', 'emotional', 'energy.Despite', 'shortcomings', 'however', 'Robing', 'Williams', 'performance', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'depth', 'emotion', 'create', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'original', 'piece', 'work']",What Dreams May Come VHS

The film focuses on how one handles grief and loss, but what is unique is how it is approached -- much like an artist's blank canvas.  As personal expressions are interpreted within the canvas in the form of colorful and emotional images, one realizes that the memories and the images can forever be embedded within the frame of a canvas.  For Williams's character Chris, that appears to be the case but not quite coincidental because his wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra) was an artist.  Chris and Annie's subject on the canvas is coming to terms with their children's death.Through present events and flashbacks before the loss, Director Vincent Ward shows that Chris and Annie lived an average life.  Their life changes after their children's accident and the quick turn of events that have Chris, especially Annie struggling to overcome their grief.  Certain parts of the film may pay reminders to other films that depict characters encountering or about to encounter life changing moments, ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" ""City of Angels,"" ""Heaven Can Wait,"" and ""Meet Joe Black.""  Indeed, all of these films possess a metaphysical quality, but ""What Dreams May Come"" may stand out from all of the above.  Chris appears to be in limbo between heaven and hell, and it is where he first ends up that looks like paradise - his wife's paintings, beautiful and celestial.  However, he is not alone in his journey and is accompanied by the first doctor that he had interned with, Albert (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).  And one wonders of the significance of each and every character or events that Chris experiences, which may make the viewer think beyond appearances.  Ward is very suggestive of the storyline that delves much deeper into the examination of natural order and choice and how it relates to how individuals deal with loss.""What Dreams May Come"" is thought provoking and questions may arise throughout the film and after.  So many words can describe the story being told within the film, but one phrase comes to mind, life is like a painting.",4,"""We choose what we want to see...""",1340496000,"06 24, 2012",2012,2287,"['Whenever', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'film', 'ordinary', 'comedic', 'roles', 'what', 'acting', 'about', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'one', 'examples', 'Williams', 'diverse', 'filmography', 'humor', 'so', 'well', 'know', 'film', 'how', 'one', 'grief', 'loss', 'what', 'unique', 'how', 'approached', 'much', 'artist', 'blank', 'canvas', 'personal', 'expressions', 'are', 'interpreted', 'canvas', 'form', 'colorful', 'emotional', 'images', 'one', 'memories', 'images', 'can', 'forever', 'be', 'embedded', 'frame', 'canvas', 'Williams', 'character', 'Chris', 'be', 'case', 'not', 'quite', 'coincidental', 'wife', 'Annie', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'was', 'artist', 'Chris', 'Annie', 'subject', 'canvas', 'coming', 'terms', 'children', 'death.Through', 'present', 'events', 'flashbacks', 'loss', 'Director', 'Vincent', 'Ward', 'Chris', 'Annie', 'lived', 'average', 'life', 'life', 'changes', 'children', 'accident', 'quick', 'turn', 'events', 'have', 'Chris', 'especially', 'Annie', 'struggling', 'overcome', 'grief', 'Certain', 'parts', 'film', 'may', 'pay', 'reminders', 'other', 'films', 'depict', 'characters', 'encountering', 'encounter', 'life', 'changing', 'moments', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'City', 'Angels', 'Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'Meet', 'Joe', 'Black', 'Indeed', 'films', 'possess', 'metaphysical', 'quality', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'may', 'stand', 'out', 'above', 'Chris', 'be', 'limbo', 'heaven', 'hell', 'where', 'first', 'up', 'paradise', 'wife', 'paintings', 'beautiful', 'celestial', 'However', 'not', 'alone', 'journey', 'accompanied', 'first', 'doctor', 'had', 'interned', 'Albert', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'one', 'wonders', 'significance', 'character', 'events', 'Chris', 'experiences', 'may', 'make', 'viewer', 'think', 'appearances', 'Ward', 'very', 'suggestive', 'storyline', 'much', 'deeper', 'examination', 'natural', 'order', 'choice', 'how', 'how', 'individuals', 'deal', 'loss', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'thought', 'provoking', 'questions', 'may', 'arise', 'film', 'So', 'many', 'words', 'can', 'describe', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'film', 'one', 'phrase', 'mind', 'life', 'painting']",What Dreams May Come VHS
458716,A281NPSIMI1C2R,6305297525,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[0, 0]","A movie is rarely made with such intense creativity. The artistic quality is completely unique, stunning and makes this visually exciting.Two souls meet and are soul mates beyond reality. Sunlit beauty entices you into the story. Emotional elements take hold of your heart and capture your attention in a way only one other movie has. This is a modern version of Somewhere in Time, with a more inventive twist. Only that movie made me feel the same way. What Dreams May Come is far more creative and captures the emotions of life with such truth. Yet, seems to have a similar theme.When Chris Nielsen and Annie meet on a lake, they never imagine they will go to hell and back, in life and in death. This is an intellectual look at how heaven and hell might be and is worth watching for those aspects alone. This is a journey into Chris' mind in life and in death. Robin Williams (Chris) and Annabella Sciorra's (Annie) acting is so wonderful. I kept thinking it is a sign of a good actor when they can play so many parts in one movie. Annabella's character goes from goddess to suicidal mother and then tortured soul. Robin's character goes from calm to courageous.Chris and Annie go through more than the normal human will ever be required to endure. When Chris dies and finds out his wife has committed suicide, he vows to find her tortured soul and bring her back to the heaven he has created for himself in his mind. He says something so profound about life and explains how he misses, books, naps and kisses. It will make you value life more.This is a quest for everlasting love and happiness in the afterlife. While I don't believe in reincarnation, that aspect plays a role in the story which is amusing. The originality in this movie is beyond creative. Having Chris end up in a heaven made of paint when he loves paintings was so wonderful! The flying creatures were so incredible and the fact that you could be anyone you wanted to be, freeing.A movie that will deepen your belief in a heaven and may even cause you to seek God and discover your soul. The aspects of respect, loyalty, courage, family, trust, love, belief in someone and endless devotion play out beautifully in the characters lives.This is a movie I will watch again and again and am so pleased I purchased it. Life can take us in its teeth and shake us around. It is in the next life where we will gain our reward or punishment.""I didn't get to say goodbye."" was what Chris said in this movie and that hit me hard because I just lost my grandmother and didn't get to say goodbye to her. Realizing that she is perhaps in the heaven of her dreams, maybe cooking in a kitchen of her imagination with my grandfather, maybe riding around in my grandfather's boat in an ocean of his imagination made me feel more at peace with my loss.A deeply spiritual and intellectual story about issues we all care about! Don't miss it, it is spectacular and magical.~The Rebecca Review",5,Creative Artistic Fantasy,993772800,"06 29, 2001",2001,2945,"['movie', 'rarely', 'made', 'such', 'intense', 'creativity', 'artistic', 'quality', 'completely', 'unique', 'stunning', 'visually', 'exciting.Two', 'souls', 'meet', 'are', 'soul', 'mates', 'reality', 'Sunlit', 'beauty', 'entices', 'story', 'Emotional', 'elements', 'take', 'hold', 'heart', 'capture', 'attention', 'way', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'movie', 'modern', 'version', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'more', 'inventive', 'twist', 'Only', 'movie', 'made', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'far', 'more', 'creative', 'emotions', 'life', 'such', 'truth', 'have', 'similar', 'theme.When', 'Chris', 'Nielsen', 'Annie', 'meet', 'lake', 'never', 'imagine', 'will', 'go', 'hell', 'back', 'life', 'death', 'intellectual', 'look', 'how', 'heaven', 'hell', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'aspects', 'alone', 'journey', 'Chris', 'mind', 'life', 'death', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Chris', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'Annie', 'acting', 'so', 'wonderful', 'kept', 'thinking', 'sign', 'good', 'actor', 'when', 'can', 'play', 'so', 'many', 'parts', 'one', 'movie', 'Annabella', 'character', 'goddess', 'suicidal', 'mother', 'then', 'tortured', 'soul', 'Robin', 'character', 'calm', 'courageous.Chris', 'Annie', 'go', 'more', 'normal', 'human', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'required', 'endure', 'When', 'Chris', 'out', 'wife', 'committed', 'suicide', 'find', 'tortured', 'soul', 'bring', 'back', 'heaven', 'created', 'mind', 'something', 'so', 'profound', 'life', 'how', 'books', 'naps', 'kisses', 'will', 'make', 'value', 'life', 'more.This', 'quest', 'everlasting', 'love', 'happiness', 'afterlife', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'reincarnation', 'aspect', 'role', 'story', 'amusing', 'originality', 'movie', 'creative', 'Having', 'Chris', 'end', 'up', 'heaven', 'made', 'paint', 'when', 'paintings', 'was', 'so', 'wonderful', 'flying', 'creatures', 'were', 'so', 'incredible', 'fact', 'could', 'be', 'anyone', 'wanted', 'be', 'freeing.A', 'movie', 'will', 'deepen', 'belief', 'heaven', 'may', 'even', 'cause', 'seek', 'God', 'discover', 'soul', 'aspects', 'respect', 'loyalty', 'courage', 'family', 'trust', 'love', 'belief', 'someone', 'endless', 'devotion', 'play', 'out', 'beautifully', 'characters', 'lives.This', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'am', 'so', 'pleased', 'purchased', 'can', 'take', 'teeth', 'shake', 'around', 'next', 'life', 'where', 'will', 'gain', 'reward', 'punishment', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'say', 'goodbye', 'was', 'what', 'Chris', 'said', 'movie', 'hit', 'hard', 'just', 'lost', 'grandmother', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'say', 'goodbye', 'Realizing', 'perhaps', 'heaven', 'dreams', 'maybe', 'cooking', 'kitchen', 'imagination', 'grandfather', 'maybe', 'riding', 'around', 'grandfather', 'boat', 'ocean', 'imagination', 'made', 'feel', 'more', 'peace', 'loss.A', 'deeply', 'spiritual', 'intellectual', 'story', 'issues', 'care', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'spectacular', 'magical.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",What Dreams May Come VHS

For me, it is one of the few films I've seen that improves on its literary source (which I also enjoyed) -- the story is considerably tighter, the dramatic tension higher.

Very, very good special effects for the time.Death, and life after death, are tough subjects, and most people shy away from them, outside the horror or tragedy genres.

458721,A16QODENBJVUI1,6305297525,Robert Moore,"[17, 20]","There are surprisingly few movies dealing with a nonterrestrial afterlife.  While there are hundreds of films dealing with the existence of individuals following death as embodied or disembodied spirits on earth, there are remarkably few that provide any glimpse of heaven.  The few that do tend to present it as an inconceivably white, vast, and indistinct place, from HERE COMES MR. JORDAN to A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH to THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT.  In contrast to these other films, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME stands out as one of the most intensely colorful, beautiful, and vividly concrete films in cinema history.The cast of the film is strong, but it would be a mistake to imagine that they are the reason for the film's success.  Robin Williams as Chris Nielsen, Cuba Gooding Jr., Rosalind Chao (who I previously mainly knew only from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION), Max von Sydow, and the lovely but underused (not only in this film, but by Hollywood in general) Annabella Sciorra all hand in wonderful performances, but they are largely overwhelmed by the astonishing beauty of the sets, the inconceivably vivid colors, and the marvelous use of light.  No performers could have competed, though they try gamely.I find the film especially interesting for theological reasons.  Ron Bass based the screenplay on a novel by Richard Mattheson.  I must confess to not knowing the work of either, but I would lay heavy money that one of them (probably Mattheson) knew well C. S. Lewis's THE GREAT DIVORCE.  In that work Lewis was concerned to lay out a concept of heaven and hell that did not regard God as responsible for sending people to hell.  Instead, he described an afterlife in which people in hell still had the option of leaving hell and departing for heaven.  These two ideas--of people placing themselves in hell and of having the option to leave hell for heaven--drive the metaphysics of WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, as I'm sure anyone who has seen the film will recognize.So why do I give the film only four stars after all the nice things I have said about it?  Primarily because the film doesn't really have all that much of a story to tell.  The plot feels like a short subject stretched to feature length film proportions.  Once you subtract all the amazing visuals, there simply wasn't that much to the film.  The challenge for the filmmakers was primarily padding out the action of the film.  Nonetheless, I do recommend this as an interesting and intensely beautiful film, despite the slender narrative.Interestingly, the title of the film comes from Hamlet's famous soliloquy, in which he ponders whether or not to commit suicide.  In the end, he decides not to because of the dreams that the dead may dream, presumably worse for having killed oneself.  But such dreams did not prevent Annie Nielsen in the film from committing suicide.  It is a nice ironical touch.",4,Visually beautiful and theologically interesting,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,2881,"['are', 'surprisingly', 'few', 'movies', 'dealing', 'nonterrestrial', 'afterlife', 'are', 'hundreds', 'films', 'dealing', 'existence', 'individuals', 'following', 'death', 'embodied', 'disembodied', 'spirits', 'earth', 'are', 'remarkably', 'few', 'provide', 'glimpse', 'heaven', 'few', 'do', 'tend', 'present', 'inconceivably', 'white', 'vast', 'indistinct', 'place', 'HERE', 'COMES', 'MR.', 'JORDAN', 'A', 'MATTER', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'AND', 'DEATH', 'THE', 'HORN', 'BLOWS', 'AT', 'MIDNIGHT', 'contrast', 'other', 'films', 'WHAT', 'DREAMS', 'MAY', 'COME', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'intensely', 'colorful', 'beautiful', 'vividly', 'concrete', 'films', 'cinema', 'history.The', 'cast', 'film', 'strong', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'imagine', 'are', 'reason', 'film', 'success', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Chris', 'Nielsen', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Rosalind', 'Chao', 'who', 'previously', 'mainly', 'knew', 'only', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'NEXT', 'GENERATION', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'lovely', 'underused', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'general', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'hand', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'are', 'largely', 'overwhelmed', 'astonishing', 'beauty', 'sets', 'inconceivably', 'vivid', 'colors', 'marvelous', 'use', 'light', 'performers', 'could', 'have', 'competed', 'try', 'gamely.I', 'find', 'film', 'especially', 'interesting', 'theological', 'reasons', 'Ron', 'Bass', 'based', 'screenplay', 'novel', 'Richard', 'Mattheson', 'must', 'confess', 'not', 'knowing', 'work', 'would', 'lay', 'heavy', 'money', 'one', 'probably', 'Mattheson', 'knew', 'well', 'C.', 'S.', 'Lewis', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'DIVORCE', 'work', 'Lewis', 'was', 'concerned', 'lay', 'out', 'concept', 'heaven', 'hell', 'did', 'not', 'regard', 'God', 'responsible', 'sending', 'people', 'hell', 'Instead', 'described', 'afterlife', 'people', 'hell', 'still', 'had', 'option', 'leaving', 'hell', 'departing', 'heaven', 'two', 'ideas', 'people', 'placing', 'hell', 'having', 'option', 'leave', 'hell', 'heaven', 'drive', 'metaphysics', 'WHAT', 'DREAMS', 'MAY', 'COME', ""'m"", 'sure', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'recognize.So', 'why', 'do', 'give', 'film', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'nice', 'things', 'have', 'said', 'Primarily', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'story', 'tell', 'plot', 'feels', 'short', 'subject', 'stretched', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'proportions', 'Once', 'subtract', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'film', 'challenge', 'filmmakers', 'was', 'primarily', 'padding', 'out', 'action', 'film', 'Nonetheless', 'do', 'recommend', 'interesting', 'intensely', 'beautiful', 'film', 'slender', 'narrative.Interestingly', 'title', 'film', 'Hamlet', 'famous', 'soliloquy', 'not', 'commit', 'suicide', 'end', 'not', 'dreams', 'dead', 'may', 'dream', 'presumably', 'worse', 'having', 'killed', 'such', 'dreams', 'did', 'not', 'prevent', 'Annie', 'Nielsen', 'film', 'committing', 'suicide', 'nice', 'ironical', 'touch']",What Dreams May Come VHS

Like many great works of art, the meaning is often left up to the viewer.  What's really important here is how the visual aspect of the film makes you feel.  The storyline is secondary, and for good reason.  It's hard to follow for one, what with the timeline jumping back and forth.  For another, it's a journey into the arena of faith and theology with barely a mention of God.  It's basically a hodgepodge of new age/reincarnation belief, psychobabble, and ultraromanticism.  I consider the storyline nothing more than a tool to explore the possibilities of modern technology in moviemaking.  In this regard this movie excels.

OK, OK, I shed a tear when the dog showed up in Heaven, what can I say... But  those FX!  As eye candy this movie rates higher than most anything since  Fantasia.  The FX are of a whole new order.

I found these  two &quot;soul mates&quot; pretty unconvincing, so that rather weakened the  most basic premise.  It's not that the leads were incompetent actors, they  emoted like crazy and conveyed pain and grief and all that stuff;  it's  just that they did not as successfully emote a steady tenderness and  intimacy -- nor was there sufficient backstory between their &quot;meet  cute&quot; moment and their later (wow, so affluent!) domestic existence.  Did they really have to be such yuppies?  could this story not have been  realized using more ordinary citizens?I really have mixed feelings about  the &quot;disguising&quot; of characters in the post-mortal world.  The  director may be trying to make a &quot;profound&quot; statement about  people's external appearances being irrelevant to the real person inside --  OK, I'll give them some benefit of the doubt.  But on the other hand,  there's something unpleasant about a cine-world in which the only non-white  people turn out to be just masks for the protagonist's whitebread teenage  kids.  Good intentions or no, I didn't care for that touch.I'm sure I  will watch it again, just to wallow in all that lush visual beauty.  I may  even sniffle a bit over the dog the 2nd time around.  But fundamentally  folks, this is Disney fare dressed up in a marvelous coat of many colours.  The beautiful plumage distracts us from the triteness of the story, the  shallowness of the character development, and the uneven writing.  Imagine,  just imagine, if all that technical wizardry had been wedded to a  first-rate script, something with the power and grace, of, say, The Lion in  Winter... or a full-BBC-cast version of the Screwtape Letters.... dream  on...",3,"Such great frosting, you hardly notice the bland cake",928454400,"06 4, 1999",1999,2218,"['bought', 'movie', 'strictly', 'FX', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'ho-hum', 'manipulative', 'tear-jerker', 'OK', 'OK', 'shed', 'tear', 'when', 'dog', 'showed', 'up', 'Heaven', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'FX', 'eye', 'candy', 'movie', 'rates', 'higher', 'most', 'anything', 'Fantasia', 'FX', 'are', 'whole', 'new', 'order', 'open', 'up', 'new', 'era', 'possibility', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'SF', 'film-making.I', 'agree', 'pro', 'reviewer', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'found', 'two', 'quot', 'soul', 'quot', 'pretty', 'unconvincing', 'rather', 'weakened', 'most', 'basic', 'premise', 'not', 'leads', 'were', 'incompetent', 'actors', 'emoted', 'crazy', 'conveyed', 'pain', 'grief', 'stuff', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'successfully', 'emote', 'steady', 'tenderness', 'intimacy', 'was', 'sufficient', 'backstory', 'quot', 'cute', 'quot', 'moment', 'later', 'wow', 'so', 'affluent', 'domestic', 'existence', 'Did', 'really', 'have', 'be', 'such', 'yuppies', 'could', 'story', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'realized', 'using', 'more', 'ordinary', 'citizens', 'really', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'quot', 'disguising', 'quot', 'characters', 'post-mortal', 'world', 'director', 'may', 'be', 'trying', 'make', 'quot', 'quot', 'statement', 'people', 'external', 'appearances', 'being', 'irrelevant', 'real', 'person', 'inside', 'OK', ""'ll"", 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'other', 'hand', 'something', 'unpleasant', 'cine-world', 'only', 'non-white', 'people', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'masks', 'protagonist', 'whitebread', 'teenage', 'kids', 'Good', 'intentions', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'touch.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'wallow', 'lush', 'visual', 'beauty', 'may', 'even', 'sniffle', 'bit', 'dog', '2nd', 'time', 'around', 'fundamentally', 'folks', 'Disney', 'fare', 'dressed', 'up', 'marvelous', 'coat', 'many', 'colours', 'beautiful', 'plumage', 'distracts', 'triteness', 'story', 'shallowness', 'character', 'development', 'uneven', 'writing', 'Imagine', 'just', 'imagine', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'had', 'been', 'wedded', 'first-rate', 'script', 'something', 'power', 'grace', 'say', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'full-BBC-cast', 'version', 'Screwtape', 'Letters', 'dream']",What Dreams May Come VHS

The Book was very very good-I really liked it. But The reincarnation I had a hard time understanding-in the book, that is.The movie made it amazingly clear.Then I saw the movie. It started out quite different from the book-Showing Chris and Annie's first meeting. I really liked this new beginning-it gave them a closer kind of feel.When their two children died, I felt kind of like I wasn't sitting in my living room anymore-but like my mind was somwhere else-wondering where they had gone-what heaven is like.When Chris gets to his own personal 'heaven' after his death, I found myself imagining my own personal paradise, one perfectly for me. I loved that feeling that you got throughout this whole movie-like as if you were saying ""What if that were me?""Hell was much liked it had been in the book-utterly terrifying but amazing in its way.But Annie's personal prison was far worse than any physical Hell-it was the mental hell, the one that we all know we have buried deep deep inside, and if we lived in it, like she would have had to, most of us would go completely and utterly insane-I know I would.Robin Williams-he's just-he's just.

His role as Albert could not have been a better pick.So when all is said and done, and the movie is over and you're sitting in the darkness, pondering what it was all trying to say, you wonder...wonder if maybe that beloved cat or dog you had as a child will come running and will knock you over and cover you with licks when you're dead and up in your heaven amoung the sky-maybe, just like Katie.And maybe, we'll keep our own heaven inside, just like our hell.",5,"Dreams May Come, But this stays with you...",1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,1909,"['read', 'Book', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'first', 'long', 'saw', 'movie', 'Book', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'good-I', 'really', 'liked', 'reincarnation', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding-in', 'book', 'is.The', 'movie', 'made', 'amazingly', 'saw', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'quite', 'different', 'book-Showing', 'Chris', 'Annie', 'first', 'meeting', 'really', 'liked', 'new', 'beginning-it', 'gave', 'closer', 'kind', 'two', 'children', 'died', 'felt', 'kind', 'was', ""n't"", 'sitting', 'living', 'room', 'anymore-but', 'mind', 'was', 'somwhere', 'else-wondering', 'where', 'had', 'gone-what', 'heaven', 'like.When', 'Chris', 'own', 'personal', 'death', 'found', 'imagining', 'own', 'personal', 'paradise', 'one', 'perfectly', 'loved', 'feeling', 'got', 'whole', 'movie-like', 'were', 'saying', 'What', 'were', 'Hell', 'was', 'much', 'liked', 'had', 'been', 'book-utterly', 'terrifying', 'amazing', 'way.But', 'Annie', 'personal', 'prison', 'was', 'far', 'worse', 'physical', 'Hell-it', 'was', 'mental', 'hell', 'one', 'know', 'have', 'buried', 'deep', 'deep', 'inside', 'lived', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'most', 'would', 'go', 'completely', 'utterly', 'insane-I', 'know', 'would.Robin', 'Williams-he', 'just-he', 'just', 'know', 'Just', 'just', 'put', 'way-if', 'could', 'act', ""'d"", 'get', 'billion', 'requests', 'movie', 'scripts', 'year', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'Chris-Robin', 'IS', 'Chris.Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'role', 'Albert', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'pick.So', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'movie', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'darkness', 'pondering', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'wonder', 'wonder', 'maybe', 'beloved', 'cat', 'dog', 'had', 'child', 'will', 'come', 'running', 'will', 'knock', 'cover', 'licks', 'when', ""'re"", 'dead', 'up', 'heaven', 'amoung', 'sky-maybe', 'just', 'Katie.And', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'own', 'heaven', 'just', 'hell']",What Dreams May Come VHS

Whilst the FX is very heavy in the movie, it is a necessary addendum to the story. In fact, wonderfully so.

I picked up this DVD and though the film tends to be maudlin at times, overall is quite a production!Philosophy:In my studies I had discovered that thought is greater than reality, and that you are not your arms, legs or brain, but you are you as a spiritual being.  The film emphasized this without beating you over the head with its spiritual thought & inspiration, but was necessary to develop this concept for the film to make sense!Annie & Chris:Annie & Chris meet with the typical Hollywood ""cute moment.""  They ram their boats into each other in Europe.  Annie has claimed Switzerland in the name of Minnesota and Chris just claims her for his bride.  We don't get a lot of character development here until well into the film.  The flashback sequences are done well and are at times extremely emotional.  Their life looks great until their children get killed in a car crash.  Annie blames herself and goes into a deep depression which she never recovers.Mythology:There are ancient tales of the hero travelling into the depths of hell to recover his love.  Even the gates of hell in the film had a large ship with the name Cerberus (the three headed dog, natch!) on front!  The imagery of heaven and hell are well-presented.  The crazy Raphaelian paintings; the upside-down cathedral; the heaven created that is actually made of paint! Crazy!Ending:The movie slam-punches grief until you can just cry with the anguish that  Annie feels.  The film tastefully covers the areas of suicide and never giving up.  And even when you lose, you win (still trying to wrap my wits  on this one).  Movie critics have said that Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra were not in tune in this film, but I beg to disagree.  At times maudlin and heart-wrenching, the actors do indeed put their heart into their work and come  out shining.DVD:Has an alternate ending which I'm glad was not in the final cut.  The actual ending was more a message of hope that did not drag the story way out.

458737,AWUUMER0F3WF4,6305297525,Sheryl Fechter,"[1, 1]","This outstanding movie is an emotional homerun.  A grand slam that clears the bases bringing home loss, pain, grief, and joy. Fully expressed and realized in the surprising visuals (Ellen M. Somers), mellifluous photography (Eduardo Serra) and carried throughout with an intoxicating musical score (Michael Kamen and The London Metropolitan Orchestra) that hauntingly swells with intensity. Vincent Ward impeccably directs a visual feast playing through paintings.  They literally come to life throughout the film placing the viewer into another dimension all within the changes of Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) and perfectly ethereal Annie's (Annabella Sciorra) realities.The two meet quite suddenly while vacationing and remarkably find that they are truly soul mates.  They may not fully realize its beauty at this venture but as time passes the wonder becomes more and more evident.  A lifetime together is altogether inevitable as they marry, have two children and begin a lovely family life.  What is immediately sorrowful is the tragic accident that takes the lives of their children and throws the couple into a gut wrenching grief.The story jumps ahead four years while the pain of loss is taking any life from the brilliantly artistic Annie.  Her paintings (by Stephen Hannock) are being affected and her mind is becoming more distraught.  It is then that a freak accident happens again and Chris dies.  She is left alone, her family gone and also her own will to live.  From this moribund beginning comes a fantastic living tale of a husband's passionate and overwhelming love for his wife driving him through heaven and hell to find her.Chris' journey begins in a heaven that he has created for himself but seen through the paintings of Annie.  An angel guide, Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), is there to aid him in realizing that he has died and must go on separately.  His creation is awash in vibrant color with an identifiable use of the color blue from the start of the film.  What he sees and makes true for himself is what Annie creates or has created.  The look at morality is done without a major pull onto any certain religion so it can astoundingly stretch the boundaries.  It's quite another view of the afterlife that is as imaginarily beautiful in its heaven as it is as boldly macabre in its hell.Annie takes her own life.  Albert gives this information to Chris who becomes desperate to save his wife from the hell she has also created.  The movie treats the act of suicide very differently than the way it may be viewed by some, with more of a compassionate tone.  As freeing as Chris' reality may be, Annie's is quite deliberately confining.  The visuals and the sets come to life and seduce the viewer into a horrifically confused state of mind.

Most of which is accurate...aside from the Christian view...which usually lacks correct information.The movie uses paintings as a way to show how our thoughts create our world....which is very different than the book.  The directory did convert it nicely to film.  However, and I really like that both endings are included.  Well made movies, like this, usually inspire people to go to the book to get more info.  I didn't really feel that with the movie.  My life's experiences have very much been about what the movie is about, so I already Know things the movie was talking about well before ever seeing it, and I remember Past Lives but I focus on Now.  It's not a Believe System for me..it IS Knowing.  I remember also, before being Born. Not many do, and that's something that IS touched on in this movie.  Step away from the Churchianity Belief System (which I was never indoctrinated into) and you'll See the many Truths this movie speaks of.  Note, please, that I'm not typing about Christianity as the 2 are very, very different.There is No Death, only Life...on many levels/dimensions and there is NOT just 1 Life.  That is a very popular misinformation and in NO religion has that ever been Taught.  This movie makes very clear what Heaven and Hell are...Emotional!  Not actual PLACES Unless Your ""Belief System"" is that a Hell exists, then you'll Create it for Yourself.  It's awesome to know, You're in control...either way.  I Love Life, and the Leading Edge Adventure that it is.  It's a Wonderful gateway movie to the Book.  Please read it, but without Brainwashed Church views.

Soon afterwards, Chris dies in a car accident as well, leaving  Annie alone bereaved.  Chris comes back, in the Spirit, to try and comfort  his wife.

Schell,"[13, 22]","Just when you thought there were plenty of tearjerkers out there, another one arrives with zealous comedian/actor Robin Williams holding its limp foundation on his star-powered shoulders. Williams arrives fresh from an Oscar win from the Damon/Affleck juggernaut &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; and plays it straight again, this time chock-full o' feigned waterworks and insufferable gloom. There is nothing but a river of tears and sorrow to row this pitiful storyline along, a tale that relentlessly tugs at the heart strings with concepts such as traversing the boundaries of hell to rescue the people you love the most. I think I'm getting weepy myself...sniff...With Oscar-winning Technicolor scenery that screams Photoshop, &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; is a web designer's wet dream and a film critic's worst nightmare. Its ocean of visual aura is not enough to keep its mawkish screenplay afloat and therefore every performance, whether mediocre or exceptional, suffers as a result. The story begins with a man named Chris Nielsen (Williams) vacationing in the beautiful countryside of Sweden where he meets his future wife Annie (Sciorra); their encounter is endearing and they almost immediately fall in love. From there, it flashes forward with small segments of their marriage and then to a beautiful home where they are parents to a teenage daughter and son. The film doesn't waste any time converting to a somber note when their children are killed in a fatal car crash. Chris follows them to the hereafter only years later, dying in a horrid collision himself and Annie is left all alone, a victim of unpreventable circumstance coping with the deaths of the people she loved the most. Chris, on the other hand, must elucidate and understand the extraordinary bond between he and his wife, tapping each other's souls through the light years between heaven and earth.There may not be any real romance in this movie, but there isn't an ounce of chemistry between Williams and his co-star, he never acute at the leading man bit and Sciorra not much of a romantic figure herself. Out of all the crybabies in this dour ditty, she's the best of the bawlers; sad to say it's her ONLY asset. Had she been paired with a more prominent and charismatic actor, her role might've been more noteworthy.Williams is practiced at sculpting a pitiable mug, the watery eyes and lip biting his key devices (watch &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; and &quot;Patch Adams&quot; for the signature sniveling). Unfortunately, you not only have sympathy for his character but you feel sorry for Williams himself for undertaking such a schmaltzy assignment. I feel that Robin is capable of more than this and &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; proved that.

OK, he's sometimes schmaltzy, but for a long time he was only given schmaltzy and/or cartoonish roles. What did anyone expect? People who are still biased against him might want to check out his later work.Anyway. I recently tuned into this film out of idle curiosity, and found myself completely mesmerized by the highly saturated colors and pretty realistic visual effects used in the film. I have to say that color and visual texture are some of my favorite things in movies; watching a richly-shaded film like ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" is, for me, to experience two hours of pure visceral delight.I really didn't care too much about what the film had to say about the living and the dead. But I tend not to get my philosophies from movies.A film critic once called the film ""Barry Lyndon"" ""a feast for the eyes, a famine for the mind."" And some may say the same of ""What Dreams May Come,"" which at least is not hobbled by the wretched excesses of Stanley Kubrick's self-indulgent direction.

Robin Williams is quite possibly the greatest actor to ever walk the earth.  He's primarily known as a comedian (and a great one at that), but he proves here that he's just as capable of doing drama, and better at it than anyone else.  Anabella Sciorra is worth an honorable mention, as well.  If she didn't win an award for this, it's quite a crime.  The basic plot of this story: everybody dies!  Robin and Ana are a married couple, with several kids, and they all die at different times.  Robin and his children are in heaven, and Ana (who commits suicide) goes to hell.  But, Robin doesn't want any part of heaven if he can't be with the girl he loves, so he goes in to save her.  Basically, this is the ultimate love story (how many people would go to hell for the one they loved?).  The story is brilliant, and the special effects are amazing.

It's theme is that Heaven or Hell is created in our own minds and circumstances.  I feel that the story itself is so unbelievable that it's hard to really ""buy"" what's going on.  For example, Robin Williams is in Heaven.  Okay, but, he is unhappy!  That right there is a problem.  For those that make it to Heaven, there are no more tears, no more sadness.  Here it's no different than here on Earth.  And, Hell is depicted as people under water, lost in a sea of turmoil, loneliness.  Hell is about the unquenchable fire tormenting people day and night!!!  Now, Robin Williams' ability to leave Heaven and go to Hell was so dumb.  I mean, if that was the case, people from Hell could traverse to Heaven.  So, if this is the case why do these two places exist?  To me this movie doesn't depict a comforting representation of Heaven or a terrible, horrifying Hell.  The story, is simple.  Robin goes to Heaven, his wife goes to Hell because of a suicide and he makes his way to Hell to get her and bring her back.  In the end, she ends up with him in Heaven with there son and a dog and a representation of their house and they both live, well, happily ever-after.  I am very, very skeptical of movies that depict places like Heaven and Hell.  There are no movies that have faithfully come close.  Is it visually stunning?  It's okay, the graphics and such are okay, nothing ""breathtaking"".  Is it believable?  Certainly not.  Would I recommend it?  Definitely not.  It will only confuse you.

You begin to appreciate this scene more after you go through the ""extras"" on the DVD where the SFX people explain the efforts that had gone into it.You marvel at the SFX of the movie but I wonder if one would still be amazed considering the glut of plotless SFX movies in these times. The overall picture quality of the DVD is good and the dolby digital 5.1 sound is excellent with good surround effects !Coming to the movie, it starts of with a breathtaking scene of Switzerland (the scene was actually shot in Montana) with it's lush surroundings and the crystal clear water with the breathtaking mountains in the backdrop. You can almost smell the flowers and one is inclined to take a deep-breath on experiencing the opening scene.The movie then starts to crawl for the next 20 minutes or so. I guess the director was probably trying to build up the characters and their interactions but nonetheless, it crawls a bit. Once that's over the tempo starts to build up !And yea ... the alternate ending if of lessor audio/video quality but is pretty nice nonetheless. I like the part in which Cuba Gooding says ""What do you mean by 'I' ? Is it your arm, your leg ... we are IN a house but we are NOT the house..."" and implies that when we are finished with a house we move on and it's the same with our body and soul.

458769,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,6305297525,Wayne C. Rogers,"[4, 5]","There's an author by the name of Richard Matheson, who's better known for his horror fiction (I Am Legend and Hell House) and the teleplays that he wrote for the original Twilight Zone series in the sixties (the most famous being Nightmare at 30,000 Feet).  This is the man who had the greatest influence on Stephen King when he was a teenager and an aspiring writer.  What many people don't know is that Richard Matheson also wrote two very powerful novels about undying love and soul mates, both of which were turned into successful movies--Somewhere In Time in 1980 and What Dreams May Come in 1998.  This posting is about What Dreams May Come.What Dreams May Come was written by Richard Matheson as a way of saying a big ""thank you"" to his wonderful wife.  He wanted to write a book that would show his love for her in a very special way.  When the novel was originally published, one of the producers of Somewhere In Time read it and decided that he would eventually turn the book into a movie.  This finally came about in 1998.  The movie, What Dreams May Come, starred Robin Williams as Chris Nielsen and Annabella Sciorra as his wife, Annie.  The story is a sad one; yet, it does have a positive ending.  More importantly, it has a strong message about life after death and how we choose to come into this life to be with the people we love and need to learn from.  In a sense, this is the unique power of love.  When you truly love someone, the energy of that emotion never goes away, no matter how many years or centuries may pass.  Love is eternal.The story of What Dreams May Come (there are plot spoilers here, so beware) deals with a middle-aged couple that has lost their two children due to a traffic accident.  They have struggled to rebuild their lives and to carry on their journey together.  But, another traffic accident takes Chris's life, and Annie is left alone to deal with her guilt and heartache and emptiness.  As Chris's spirit gradually accepts his death, he moves into the after life, or to a very special place that's built on happy memories from his previous life.  You could say that it's the place where dreams are born.  He meets the man who helped trained him to be a doctor and is guided by him in an effort to readjust to this new state of being.  Eventually Chris will encounter his two children, whose memories have never left his heart.  In time, however, he finds out that Annie has committed suicide.  She found herself unable to go on without him.  Because of her belief system and because her death is a suicide, Annie's spirit ends up in what might be referred to as hell.  Chris refuses to accept that he may never see Annie again and decides to go after her.  Though no spirit has ever done this before, Chris is determined to make the journey to hell and to bring his wife back.  This is the strength of his love for her.  If he can't bring Annie back, then he'll stay in hell with her for the rest of his existence.Needless to say, you need a big box of Kleenexes when you watch What Dreams May Come.  This movie has a number of poignant moments about true love and death and the people who are interconnected to us.  The photography and special effects are awesome.  The movie makes you believe in life after death, and that it can be the most beautiful place that one's mind can imagine.  I think this is one of the reasons the film had such a powerful affect upon me.  When I saw it at the movie theater in 1998, I continued to sit there for at least ten minutes after the end credits had rolled.  I wasn't the only one, either.  That night, I went to see it again with some friends, and we all seemed to experience the same kind of sensation when the movie ended.  It touched something deep within us that was desperately needed.  I think that as human beings, we need these very special experiences every so often in order to keep us moving through the ups and downs of life.  Without these moments in time that touch our hearts and souls, we would simply be moving forward as if on autopilot.  There's about twenty-five minutes of extras on this DVD that deal with the making of the movie.

458774,AEGBJ94DCVH5Y,6305297525,x_bruce,"[1, 1]","As a complete film 'What Dreams May Come' fails to meet criteria that critics tend to expect. While the plot is pedestrian it still works on a visceral and metaphoric level. The dialog is frequently mundaine to manipulative, yet isn't that part of the movie going experience? Can't something be interesting without being profound?For me the answer is yes, not every film needs to be profound. Sometimes I just want to be entertained and that can be in a number of ways. Another negative, the score detracts because it is so obvious, yet with all of these problems I sat through the film in awe and bought into the idea of a person's will to make things right. It's archetypal drama that dares to be positive in a time where ambigious and tragic films or mindless comedies that rely on shock value and often ugly humor seem to be all the rage.The acting is very good, Robin Williams doesn't mug his way through the part as some have implied. Some backlash could be the 'nice guy' syndrome around his previous and even future films. If you identify with that issue you'll not enjoy what is a multifaceted performance.Any film that can get me to suspend disbelief even in poorly scripted moments does something right and in this case there are several positives to mention.The set design and lighting are dazzling. The realization of living your own reality is the films strongest suit because the design flawlessly creates the various worlds in What Dreams May Come.Besides the great, oscar winning visual effects the casting is excellent with enough genuinely surprising moments to keep suspense while developing the slender plot. Cuba Gooding Jr. does great work as a guide in heaven or wherever you care to call it. As an actor he has learned to become whatever the character requires without overacting.While a moody, even sombre film, What Dreams May Come is visually arresting with solid acting that makes a hackneyed Hollywood script emotionally satisfying and even gives you something to think about.Although not a 5 star film, What Dreams May Come still satisfies in terms of entertainment. The DVD is as vibrant as the film and has interesting extras.",4,Stunning Visuals....,1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,2159,"['complete', 'film', ""'What"", 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'fails', 'meet', 'criteria', 'critics', 'tend', 'expect', 'plot', 'pedestrian', 'still', 'visceral', 'metaphoric', 'level', 'dialog', 'frequently', 'mundaine', 'manipulative', ""n't"", 'part', 'movie', 'going', 'experience', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'something', 'be', 'interesting', 'being', 'profound', 'answer', 'yes', 'not', 'film', 'be', 'profound', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'can', 'be', 'number', 'ways', 'negative', 'score', 'so', 'obvious', 'yet', 'problems', 'sat', 'film', 'awe', 'bought', 'idea', 'person', 'will', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'archetypal', 'drama', 'be', 'positive', 'time', 'where', 'ambigious', 'tragic', 'films', 'mindless', 'comedies', 'rely', 'shock', 'value', 'often', 'ugly', 'humor', 'seem', 'be', 'rage.The', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'Robin', 'Williams', ""n't"", 'mug', 'way', 'part', 'have', 'implied', 'backlash', 'could', 'be', ""'nice"", 'guy', 'syndrome', 'previous', 'even', 'future', 'films', 'identify', 'issue', ""'ll"", 'not', 'enjoy', 'what', 'multifaceted', 'performance.Any', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'even', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'moments', 'something', 'right', 'case', 'are', 'several', 'positives', 'mention.The', 'set', 'design', 'lighting', 'are', 'dazzling', 'realization', 'living', 'own', 'reality', 'films', 'strongest', 'suit', 'design', 'flawlessly', 'various', 'worlds', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come.Besides', 'great', 'oscar', 'winning', 'visual', 'effects', 'casting', 'excellent', 'enough', 'genuinely', 'surprising', 'moments', 'keep', 'suspense', 'developing', 'slender', 'plot', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'great', 'work', 'guide', 'heaven', 'wherever', 'care', 'call', 'actor', 'learned', 'become', 'character', 'moody', 'even', 'sombre', 'film', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'visually', 'arresting', 'solid', 'acting', 'hackneyed', 'Hollywood', 'script', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'even', 'something', 'think', 'not', '5', 'star', 'film', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'still', 'terms', 'entertainment', 'DVD', 'as', 'vibrant', 'film', 'interesting', 'extras']",What Dreams May Come VHS
458775,AP3B615GM191G,6305297525,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 2]","A little while back, I watched Jim Carrey's effort to be taken seriously after a slew of comedies, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"".  This is a similar effort (this time from Robin Williams), but not nearly as intriguing.For a basic plot summary, this film centers on the other-wordlly experiences of Chris Nielson (Williams), who dies suddenly in a car wreck.  He discovers that the hereafter is whatever his mind makes it, and thus rather peacefully resides within a painting of his wife, Annie (Annabella Sciorra).  The only thorn in Nielson's ""ever-after"", though, is the real-world depression (and eventual death) of his wife.  Then, when Annie is sent to ""the other place"", Chris begins a quest to save her from her darkest demon: herself.What makes this movie interesting to watch is the fantastic imagery.  The visual rendering of heaven and hell are quite stunning, and not something you'll see in any other film.  It is filled with color, pizzazz, and great imagination.Unfortunately, the plot doesn't nearly measure up to the visual effects.  It ultimately takes much too long to reach its zenith, and in between the viewers are left with some uneven emotional moments.  Some will make you care and draw you in, while others don't have that desired effect.Overall, this is a decent film, but on that doesn't hold a candle to its nearest cohort (""Eternal Sunshine..."").  Watch it for the stunning visuals, but don't expect much more depth.",3,"Incredible Imagery, Uneven Plot",1281225600,"08 8, 2010",2010,1456,"['little', 'while', 'back', 'watched', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'effort', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'slew', 'comedies', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'similar', 'effort', 'time', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'not', 'nearly', 'intriguing.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'film', 'centers', 'other-wordlly', 'experiences', 'Chris', 'Nielson', 'Williams', 'who', 'suddenly', 'car', 'wreck', 'hereafter', 'mind', 'thus', 'rather', 'peacefully', 'resides', 'painting', 'wife', 'Annie', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'only', 'thorn', 'Nielson', 'ever-after', 'real-world', 'depression', 'eventual', 'death', 'wife', 'Then', 'when', 'Annie', 'sent', 'other', 'place', 'Chris', 'quest', 'save', 'darkest', 'demon', 'herself.What', 'movie', 'interesting', 'watch', 'fantastic', 'imagery', 'visual', 'rendering', 'heaven', 'hell', 'are', 'quite', 'stunning', 'not', 'something', ""'ll"", 'see', 'other', 'film', 'filled', 'color', 'pizzazz', 'great', 'imagination.Unfortunately', 'plot', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'measure', 'up', 'visual', 'effects', 'ultimately', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'reach', 'zenith', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'uneven', 'emotional', 'moments', 'will', 'make', 'care', 'draw', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'desired', 'effect.Overall', 'decent', 'film', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'nearest', 'cohort', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Watch', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'more', 'depth']",What Dreams May Come VHS
