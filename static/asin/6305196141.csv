454141,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,6305196141,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 5]","This video was shown at my daughter's elementary school today. She enjoyed watching the cartoon version of this and thought the characters in the movie are cool. The challenge of making history seem real and meaningful to young people continues to be a big one. Even the greatest of names are difficult to bring to life when they aren't associated with someone who is living today.In this fantastic story we have two friends, one black and one white, learn about King during a school field trip, and soon find themselves traveling through time to meet King in his youth and then follow him through history, up until the day he was killed in 1968. In the process, they learn a lot about racial segregation and King's role in working to bring down the barriers in the U.S. south. At times, the shift from cartoon to news footage seems a bit forced, but it works most of the time. Although the story lacks substance, this is not a major problem since King's own story is so compelling.The cast of voices is impressive, with 16 recognizable names, including leading African American performers such as James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Samuel L. Jackson and others. The film was made in co-operation with the King family, with Yolanda and Dexter also lending their voices to the production. While there's no attempt here to provide a complete picture of King's life, the major events of the civil rights movement are covered off quite well. The combination of animation and real footage was up to par and I recommend this movie to everyone.",5,A great elementary school video about a great man,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,1566,"['video', 'was', 'shown', 'daughter', 'elementary', 'school', 'today', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'cartoon', 'version', 'thought', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'cool', 'challenge', 'making', 'history', 'seem', 'real', 'meaningful', 'young', 'people', 'be', 'big', 'one', 'Even', 'greatest', 'names', 'are', 'difficult', 'bring', 'life', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'associated', 'someone', 'who', 'living', 'today.In', 'fantastic', 'story', 'have', 'two', 'friends', 'one', 'black', 'one', 'white', 'learn', 'King', 'school', 'field', 'trip', 'soon', 'find', 'traveling', 'time', 'meet', 'King', 'youth', 'then', 'follow', 'history', 'up', 'day', 'was', 'killed', '1968', 'process', 'learn', 'lot', 'racial', 'segregation', 'King', 'role', 'working', 'bring', 'down', 'barriers', 'U.S.', 'south', 'times', 'shift', 'cartoon', 'news', 'footage', 'bit', 'forced', 'most', 'time', 'story', 'substance', 'not', 'major', 'problem', 'King', 'own', 'story', 'so', 'compelling.The', 'cast', 'voices', 'impressive', '16', 'recognizable', 'names', 'including', 'leading', 'African', 'American', 'performers', 'such', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'others', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'co-operation', 'King', 'family', 'Yolanda', 'Dexter', 'also', 'lending', 'voices', 'production', 'attempt', 'here', 'provide', 'complete', 'picture', 'King', 'life', 'major', 'events', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'are', 'covered', 'quite', 'well', 'combination', 'animation', 'real', 'footage', 'was', 'up', 'par', 'recommend', 'movie', 'everyone']",Our Friend Martin VHS
