The stories are excellent, the acting better than average.

I cannot imagine why anyone  would recommend these movies.The quality of film and sound is so bad that they are almost impossible at times to hear and it is tedious trying to adjust the right colors. BUT...the movies themselves are AWFUL, the acting is dreadful, and the plotlines are transparent.These are among the worst TV movies ever shown. If they are ""rare"" it is because nobody ever thought they could show them on TV or in public again, until this blessed medium of DVD became available and marketeers realized even Eskimos could be persuaded to buy ice with the right packaging.",1,Should Have Stayed Forgotten,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,685,"['am', 'writing', 'review', 'was', 'misled', 'buying', 'DVD', 'based', 'one', 'review', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'recommend', 'movies.The', 'quality', 'film', 'sound', 'so', 'bad', 'are', 'almost', 'impossible', 'times', 'hear', 'tedious', 'trying', 'adjust', 'right', 'colors', 'BUT', 'movies', 'are', 'AWFUL', 'acting', 'dreadful', 'plotlines', 'are', 'transparent.These', 'are', 'worst', 'TV', 'movies', 'ever', 'shown', 'are', 'rare', 'nobody', 'ever', 'thought', 'could', 'show', 'TV', 'public', 'again', 'blessed', 'medium', 'DVD', 'became', 'available', 'marketeers', 'realized', 'even', 'Eskimos', 'could', 'be', 'persuaded', 'buy', 'ice', 'right', 'packaging']",N/A

There wasn't much they could do with it, I guess, coming from made-for-tv movies of the 70s. But the actors and stories were first rate and we enjoyed them.

702064,A1H1BUM6QZ4ROZ,B000067D6O,Trevor William Douglas,"[74, 78]","First: They Call It Murder (1970) with Jim Hutton. A fantastic whodunit that will keep you guessing until the very end. The music and characters are appealing and the plot moves at a perfect pace.Second: Murder Once Removed (1971) with John Forsythe, Barbara Bain, Richard Kiley,Joseph Campanella and Reta Shaw. A very tense dramatic thriller with many plot twists. Make sure you are paying attention!Third: A Tattered Web (1971) A tour de force for Lloyd Bridges in one his finest dramatic roles. The film is intense and very entertaining with fine suppport from Frank Converse, Murray Hamilton and Broderick Crawford.Al in all a terrific package.
