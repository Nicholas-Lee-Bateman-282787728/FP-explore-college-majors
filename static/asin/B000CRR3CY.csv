This amazing World series would be an excellent purchase for any baseball fan (much like the 1985 Royals-Cards DVD set) but if you are a fan of the Pirates then it is a must have.Being able to see Willie Stargell, Dave Parker, Omar Mareno, and of course Kent Tekulve among many others including the great stars if the Orioles of the time is awesome, not to mention the commentary from Howard Cosell. There will never be another Howard Cosell!The fact that this is the Pirates vs the Orioles in the World Series is also cool because niether team has been relevant in a while.The series itself is very dramatic with alot of highs and lows for both teams, and even though I knew the outcome, I found myself on edge at times.The picture quality varies between games but is watchable (remember this is 1979) and unfortunately the first few games are missing the screen graphics, but this is my only gripe on the games themselves.Now the only reason I gave this a four and not a five is the extras. There are alot of them but they are all short and there is no season review. But the ones that are here are cool none the less. I would just like more, a longer post game celebration, more interviews, and again I was really surprised there was no season review!All in all, a very good set, and I would like to see a 1971 series set if the games still exist. The game 7 1960 DVD is very cool also, but I will post that review later.",4,"The Pirates will be good again, but until then there is always this",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,1569,"['die-hard', 'Pirate', 'fan', 'not', 'much', 'fall', 'back', 'recently', 'history', 'rich', 'reached', 'pinnacle', 'point', '1979', 'amazing', 'World', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'purchase', 'baseball', 'fan', 'much', '1985', 'Royals-Cards', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'fan', 'Pirates', 'then', 'must', 'have.Being', 'able', 'see', 'Willie', 'Stargell', 'Dave', 'Parker', 'Omar', 'Mareno', 'course', 'Kent', 'Tekulve', 'many', 'others', 'including', 'great', 'stars', 'Orioles', 'time', 'awesome', 'not', 'mention', 'commentary', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'fact', 'Pirates', 'vs', 'Orioles', 'World', 'Series', 'also', 'cool', 'team', 'been', 'relevant', 'while.The', 'series', 'very', 'dramatic', 'alot', 'highs', 'lows', 'teams', 'even', 'knew', 'outcome', 'found', 'edge', 'times.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'varies', 'games', 'watchable', 'remember', '1979', 'unfortunately', 'first', 'few', 'games', 'are', 'missing', 'screen', 'graphics', 'only', 'gripe', 'games', 'themselves.Now', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'four', 'not', 'five', 'extras', 'are', 'alot', 'are', 'short', 'season', 'review', 'ones', 'are', 'here', 'are', 'cool', 'less', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'more', 'longer', 'post', 'game', 'celebration', 'more', 'interviews', 'again', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'was', 'season', 'review', 'very', 'good', 'set', 'would', 'like', 'see', '1971', 'series', 'set', 'games', 'still', 'exist', 'game', '7', '1960', 'DVD', 'very', 'cool', 'also', 'will', 'post', 'review', 'later']",The Pittsburgh Pirates 1979 World Series

961674,A1FV5LUUWMMAN5,B000CRR3CY,M. Johnson,"[4, 5]","In my opinion, NBC did a better job with baseball coverage in the '70's than ABC.  That said, ABC's coverage is in no way bad.  The announcing for the series is as follows: Keith Jackson, Don Drysdale, and Howard Cosell handle it in Baltimore, while in Pittsburgh Al Michaels replaces Jackson (Keith was working that weekend's Texas-Oklahoma game).  They do a good job on the broadcasts.  Jackson is of course, at the top of his game.  Drysdale provides good analysis and does a credible job on play-by-play, too.  Michaels does a nice job as well.  ABC probably felt they had to have Cosell on the World Series broadcasts since he was their most recognizable announcer.  While I certainly understand that some found him annoying, I thought he was alright.  Having said that, he has one of the phoniest-sounding laughs I've ever heard.The video and audio quality vary on these discs.  Game 7's VQ is especially bad.  Also as previously mentioned, in three games ABC's original graphics have been removed for some reason.  The extras are good, with my favorite being the final half-inning of the NLCS clincher.Overall, this is a very good set and a recommended purchase for baseball fans.

They came back the old fashioned way.Besides these points, the series offers an interesting view of life in the major leagues in this era.  Baseball lives on the crumbs that football leaves behind, playing in football arenas in Pitt, and in a chewed up field in Balt.  The uniforms, particularly the Bucs, are raucous.  Never was there so much color (unless perhaps the Astros).Nevertheless, the field feels natural in Balt. It isn't an over manicured garden.  It feels like a day at the park.The announcers have an interesting rapport, Drysdale's dry wit, Cosell's sometimes prescient calls, and Al Michaels in the middle.  There's more conversation than there is these days w Joe Buck's son (who sounds grim).So in closing, I don't think a baseball fan can go wrong w this series.  A great series, great players.

961677,A11HJVJD924KBW,B000CRR3CY,T. Fitzgerald,"[0, 0]","The 1979 Pirates were a team that was reminiscent of another Pirate team:  the 1960 Pirates.  Both were World Series champions; and both made dramatic, come-from-behind victories seem almost habitual.Unlike the 1960 Pirates, I was able to follow the 1979 Pirates from the first pitch of the season to the final out of this World Series.  And this video series is a wonderful way to re-live that memory.  Or educate young Pirate fans about the lessons that can be learned from one of the greatest teams in their franchise's history:  teamwork, facing adversity -- and just how to have some fun!The NL East title was not even close to a run-away for the 1979 Pirates; they had to scrap it out until the final day of the season to earn their first post-season appearance in four years.  And many of their victories throughout the season were last-at-bat, come-from-behind victories.  After sweeping the Reds in the NLCS, they faced the favored Orioles in the 1979 World Series.  Following victories by each team in Baltimore, the Series moved to Pittsburgh, where the Pirates quickly found themselves deep inside of a precarious hole -- one loss away from defeat in the Series.Moved by the passing of Skipper Chuck Tanner's mother on the morning of Game 5 (and perhaps reminded of past Pirate dramatics, with the ceremonial first pitch that day thrown out by Bill Mazeroski), the Pirates found new life in what had now become, for them, a do-or-die Series.  And they battled back to become world champions -- as well as the first MLB team to win a second World Series after having been down 3-games-to-1 (the first Pirate -- and MLB -- team to win a World Series in this fashion was the 1925 Pirates).",5,Never Say Die!,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,1698,"['1979', 'Pirates', 'were', 'team', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'Pirate', 'team', '1960', 'Pirates', 'were', 'World', 'Series', 'champions', 'made', 'dramatic', 'come-from-behind', 'victories', 'seem', 'almost', '1960', 'Pirates', 'was', 'able', 'follow', '1979', 'Pirates', 'first', 'pitch', 'season', 'final', 'out', 'World', 'Series', 'video', 'series', 'wonderful', 'way', 're-live', 'memory', 'educate', 'young', 'Pirate', 'fans', 'lessons', 'can', 'be', 'learned', 'one', 'greatest', 'teams', 'franchise', 'history', 'teamwork', 'facing', 'adversity', 'just', 'how', 'have', 'fun', 'NL', 'East', 'title', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'run-away', '1979', 'Pirates', 'had', 'scrap', 'out', 'final', 'day', 'season', 'earn', 'first', 'post-season', 'appearance', 'four', 'years', 'many', 'victories', 'season', 'were', 'last-at-bat', 'come-from-behind', 'victories', 'sweeping', 'Reds', 'NLCS', 'faced', 'favored', 'Orioles', '1979', 'World', 'Series', 'Following', 'victories', 'team', 'Baltimore', 'Series', 'moved', 'Pittsburgh', 'where', 'Pirates', 'quickly', 'found', 'deep', 'precarious', 'hole', 'one', 'loss', 'away', 'defeat', 'Series.Moved', 'passing', 'Skipper', 'Chuck', 'Tanner', 'mother', 'morning', 'Game', '5', 'perhaps', 'reminded', 'past', 'Pirate', 'dramatics', 'ceremonial', 'first', 'pitch', 'day', 'thrown', 'out', 'Bill', 'Mazeroski', 'Pirates', 'found', 'new', 'life', 'what', 'had', 'now', 'become', 'do-or-die', 'Series', 'battled', 'back', 'become', 'world', 'champions', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'MLB', 'team', 'win', 'second', 'World', 'Series', 'having', 'been', 'down', '3-games-to-1', 'first', 'Pirate', 'MLB', 'team', 'win', 'World', 'Series', 'fashion', 'was', '1925', 'Pirates']",The Pittsburgh Pirates 1979 World Series
961678,A19Y4W9RZDRNF4,B000CRR3CY,Theo Logos,"[18, 18]","The past 14 baseball seasons have put this Pittsburgh Pirates fan into a funky malaise, as year after year my Buccos rack up more loses than victories, and continue to stock their team with raw green youths and stop-gap, over the hill rent-a-players. So finding the 1979 World Series in this nicely packaged DVD format was just the remedy I needed to pull me out of my perennial baseball blues. What better way to escape from the melancholy gloom that is the Pirates present than to immerse oneself in their glorious past?Watching this great World Series was like a wonderful family reunion. Everyone was there - Pops, Cobra, Teke, Scrap Iron, Mad Dog, Otter, Antelope, Candy Man, Sangy, Crazy Horse, Hammer, Rook, and on and on - the whole family. To once again see Willie Stargell windmill his bat and hit a majestic home run, or Kent Tekulve use that goofy side arm delivery to retire batters, erased for a moment the pain of the present and took me back to the days of my youth when the Pirates used ""lumber and lightning"" to dominate baseball, and their driving disco theme song ""We Are Fam-a-lee"" became a joyous anthem that lifted the hearts of every Pirates fan.Even after putting aside my partisan preference, the 1979 World Series was a gem. It matched up two expert and colorful managers in Chuck Tanner and the cunning Earl Weaver, as well as the two powerful teams that included three future Hall of Famers (Willie Stargell, Eddie Murray, and Jim Palmer). The Pirates came back from being down three games to one to win the series on the power of an outstanding performance by Willie Stargell, who not only was named MVP of the series, but won baseball's MVP award that year in his final great season. Two games really stand out in my mind. Game two, when a late inning pinch hit by Manny Sanguillen (once the Pirates' star catcher, but relegated to the bench in the twilight of his career) provided the game winning RBI is the first. (Sanguillen later dedicated his hit to his late, great teammate, Roberto Clemente.) Game five is the other, perhaps the greatest in the series. Pittsburgh faced elimination after loosing two straight games at home, and Tanner, in a surprise move, gave the ball to an aging Jim Rooker, whose lousy season that year was a sign that his effective years were behind him. Rooker rose to the challenge and pitched like a champion, winning the game as the last hurrah of his career, and sending the series back to Baltimore.As others have mentioned, the picture and sound quality vary from disc to disc, but nothing that can distract from the joy of seeing this great team win it all once again. The packaging is first rate - each game disc having its own case which displays its box score and details from the game. If you are a Pirates fans, you can't afford not to include this wonderful reminder of past glory in your collection, to watch whenever the gloom of our perpetual season of discontent gets you down.Theo Logos",5,Family Reunion,1153872000,"07 26, 2006",2006,2965,"['past', '14', 'baseball', 'seasons', 'have', 'put', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pirates', 'fan', 'funky', 'malaise', 'year', 'year', 'Buccos', 'rack', 'up', 'more', 'loses', 'victories', 'continue', 'stock', 'team', 'raw', 'green', 'youths', 'stop-gap', 'hill', 'rent-a-players', 'So', 'finding', '1979', 'World', 'Series', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'DVD', 'format', 'was', 'just', 'remedy', 'needed', 'pull', 'perennial', 'baseball', 'blues', 'What', 'better', 'way', 'escape', 'melancholy', 'gloom', 'Pirates', 'present', 'immerse', 'glorious', 'past', 'Watching', 'great', 'World', 'Series', 'was', 'wonderful', 'family', 'reunion', 'Everyone', 'was', 'Pops', 'Cobra', 'Teke', 'Scrap', 'Iron', 'Mad', 'Dog', 'Otter', 'Antelope', 'Candy', 'Man', 'Sangy', 'Crazy', 'Horse', 'Hammer', 'Rook', 'whole', 'family', 'once', 'again', 'see', 'Willie', 'Stargell', 'windmill', 'bat', 'hit', 'majestic', 'home', 'run', 'Kent', 'Tekulve', 'use', 'goofy', 'side', 'arm', 'delivery', 'retire', 'batters', 'erased', 'moment', 'pain', 'present', 'took', 'back', 'days', 'youth', 'when', 'Pirates', 'used', 'lumber', 'lightning', 'dominate', 'baseball', 'driving', 'disco', 'theme', 'song', 'Are', 'Fam-a-lee', 'became', 'joyous', 'anthem', 'lifted', 'hearts', 'Pirates', 'fan.Even', 'putting', 'aside', 'partisan', 'preference', '1979', 'World', 'Series', 'was', 'gem', 'matched', 'up', 'two', 'expert', 'colorful', 'managers', 'Chuck', 'Tanner', 'cunning', 'Earl', 'Weaver', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'powerful', 'teams', 'included', 'three', 'future', 'Hall', 'Famers', 'Willie', 'Stargell', 'Eddie', 'Murray', 'Jim', 'Palmer', 'Pirates', 'came', 'back', 'being', 'down', 'three', 'games', 'one', 'win', 'series', 'power', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Willie', 'Stargell', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'named', 'MVP', 'series', 'won', 'baseball', 'MVP', 'award', 'year', 'final', 'great', 'season', 'Two', 'games', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'mind', 'Game', 'two', 'when', 'late', 'inning', 'pinch', 'hit', 'Manny', 'Sanguillen', 'once', 'Pirates', 'star', 'catcher', 'relegated', 'bench', 'twilight', 'career', 'provided', 'game', 'winning', 'RBI', 'first', 'Sanguillen', 'later', 'dedicated', 'hit', 'late', 'great', 'teammate', 'Roberto', 'Clemente', 'Game', 'five', 'other', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'series', 'Pittsburgh', 'faced', 'elimination', 'loosing', 'two', 'straight', 'games', 'home', 'Tanner', 'surprise', 'move', 'gave', 'ball', 'aging', 'Jim', 'Rooker', 'lousy', 'season', 'year', 'was', 'sign', 'effective', 'years', 'were', 'Rooker', 'rose', 'challenge', 'pitched', 'champion', 'winning', 'game', 'last', 'hurrah', 'career', 'sending', 'series', 'back', 'Baltimore.As', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'vary', 'disc', 'disc', 'nothing', 'can', 'distract', 'joy', 'seeing', 'great', 'team', 'win', 'once', 'again', 'packaging', 'first', 'rate', 'game', 'having', 'own', 'case', 'box', 'score', 'details', 'game', 'are', 'Pirates', 'fans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'not', 'include', 'wonderful', 'reminder', 'past', 'glory', 'collection', 'watch', 'whenever', 'gloom', 'perpetual', 'season', 'discontent', 'down.Theo', 'Logos']",The Pittsburgh Pirates 1979 World Series

That said, one thing that can make or break an old game for me is who is calling the action.  In this set, you can't go wrong as the great Keith Jackson does the play-by-play along with Don Drysdale and Howard Cosell in games 1, 2, 6, & 7.  Al Michaels fills in for games 3-5 while Jackson was away for the Texas/Oklahoma football game.  For those too young to remember him, Howard was a polarizing figure in sports journalism.  However, after watching games on FOX where we are constantly being bombarded by goofy special effects and screens polluted with every conceivable bit of information, Howard comes off as rather innocuous and insightful.

The games themselves are pretty exciting despite some of the worst defense you'll ever see in a World Series, and some pretty bad playing conditions for the first 4 games.  In games 1 & 2, Memorial Stadium is a mess with cold weather, rain, and two huge patches of mud in the outfield.  In games 3 & 4, the weather is also bad with garbage blowing all over the field, particularly in game 4.  The graphics are missing in games 3 & 4, but the quality of the audio and video is acceptable considering these games were played in 1979.  All in all, these are some fun games to relive.  Oh yeah, these are also some of the longest World Series games ever played so don't start watching a game if you don't have time to finish it.",5,Keith Jackson is still the best,1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,1633,"['love', 'watching', 'old', 'sporting', 'events', 'were', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'said', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'old', 'game', 'who', 'calling', 'action', 'set', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'great', 'Keith', 'Jackson', 'play-by-play', 'Don', 'Drysdale', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'games', '1', '2', '6', '7', 'Al', 'Michaels', 'fills', 'games', '3-5', 'Jackson', 'was', 'away', 'Texas/Oklahoma', 'football', 'game', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'Howard', 'was', 'polarizing', 'figure', 'sports', 'journalism', 'However', 'watching', 'games', 'FOX', 'where', 'are', 'constantly', 'being', 'bombarded', 'goofy', 'special', 'effects', 'screens', 'polluted', 'conceivable', 'bit', 'information', 'Howard', 'off', 'rather', 'innocuous', 'insightful', 'great', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane.The', 'series', 'great', 'time', 'capsule', 'baseball', 'history', 'featuring', 'Hall', 'Famers', 'Jim', 'Palmer', 'Eddie', 'Murray', 'Willie', 'Stargell', 'Bert', 'Blyleven', 'games', 'are', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'worst', 'defense', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'World', 'Series', 'pretty', 'bad', 'playing', 'conditions', 'first', '4', 'games', 'games', '1', '2', 'Memorial', 'Stadium', 'mess', 'cold', 'weather', 'rain', 'two', 'huge', 'patches', 'mud', 'outfield', 'games', '3', '4', 'weather', 'also', 'bad', 'garbage', 'blowing', 'field', 'particularly', 'game', '4', 'graphics', 'are', 'missing', 'games', '3', '4', 'quality', 'audio', 'video', 'acceptable', 'considering', 'games', 'were', 'played', '1979', 'are', 'fun', 'games', 'relive', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'are', 'also', 'longest', 'World', 'Series', 'games', 'ever', 'played', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'watching', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'finish']",The Pittsburgh Pirates 1979 World Series
