825676,A3IKLTT9JQACCI,B00027JYCQ,Becky Rose,"[3, 3]","My son (6 years old, diagnosed with autism) absolutely loves this series of dvds.  His thirst for both tv and knowledge is satisfied with this eclectic teacher, magic school bus, and well rounded group of kids.As an adult, I enjoy the dvds.  They're interesting and educational - full of fascinating facts that you never knew.  Plus, Lily Tomlin is the perfect Ms. Frizzle.These are well written and acted (voice) enough to keep children engrossed.  There is enough drama and humor throughout to keep it from ever feeling like they're being forced to learn something useful - but they are!They're also excellent tools to open discussions about nature, bees, how caterpillars turn into butterfly's and they explain way better than I ever could.Another added bonus for me personally is that my son has loads and loads of anxiety.  These informative dvds educate him about things such as bees and take the fear out.  He's not even afraid of spiders after watching ""creepy, crawly fun.""I highly recommend for all children.",5,Absolutely Wonderful DVDs,1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,1018,"['son', '6', 'years', 'old', 'diagnosed', 'autism', 'absolutely', 'series', 'dvds', 'thirst', 'tv', 'knowledge', 'satisfied', 'eclectic', 'teacher', 'magic', 'school', 'bus', 'well', 'rounded', 'group', 'kids.As', 'adult', 'enjoy', 'dvds', ""'re"", 'interesting', 'educational', 'full', 'fascinating', 'facts', 'never', 'knew', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'perfect', 'Ms.', 'Frizzle.These', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'voice', 'enough', 'keep', 'children', 'engrossed', 'enough', 'drama', 'humor', 'keep', 'ever', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'being', 'forced', 'learn', 'something', 'useful', 'are', ""'re"", 'also', 'excellent', 'tools', 'open', 'discussions', 'nature', 'bees', 'how', 'caterpillars', 'turn', 'butterfly', 'explain', 'way', 'better', 'ever', 'could.Another', 'added', 'bonus', 'personally', 'son', 'loads', 'loads', 'anxiety', 'informative', 'dvds', 'educate', 'things', 'such', 'bees', 'take', 'fear', 'out', 'not', 'even', 'afraid', 'spiders', 'watching', 'creepy', 'crawly', 'fun', 'highly', 'recommend', 'children']","Magic School Bus - Bugs, Bugs, Bugs"

Diangelo ""Writer & Editor""","[4, 4]","The Magic School Bus created some of the finest products for instruction, while completely disguising this fact to many of its young learners. Children exposed to the vast array of offerings in the field of science at young ages are still in possession of this information today. The original manner in which the students contribute information via their personalities and curiosity mix with our children's own natural instinctive curiosity about the world in which we live. Topics from this series include concepts as specific as mold and the manner in which it can help and hinder us, to as broad as the vast solar system, and systems beyond. Bugs, Bugs, Bugs is a title uniquely dedicated to the many insects and their many purposes common to our world. The only downside is that the series has apparently long been discontinued.",5,Quenching that yearning for learning through entertainment,1155945600,"08 19, 2006",2006,832,"['Magic', 'School', 'Bus', 'created', 'finest', 'products', 'instruction', 'completely', 'disguising', 'fact', 'many', 'young', 'learners', 'Children', 'exposed', 'vast', 'array', 'offerings', 'field', 'science', 'young', 'ages', 'are', 'still', 'possession', 'information', 'today', 'original', 'manner', 'students', 'contribute', 'information', 'personalities', 'curiosity', 'mix', 'children', 'own', 'natural', 'instinctive', 'curiosity', 'world', 'live', 'Topics', 'series', 'include', 'concepts', 'as', 'specific', 'mold', 'manner', 'can', 'help', 'hinder', 'as', 'broad', 'vast', 'solar', 'system', 'systems', 'Bugs', 'Bugs', 'Bugs', 'title', 'uniquely', 'dedicated', 'many', 'insects', 'many', 'purposes', 'common', 'world', 'only', 'downside', 'series', 'apparently', 'long', 'been', 'discontinued']","Magic School Bus - Bugs, Bugs, Bugs"

825679,A3UV7L5ND3EH8T,B00027JYCQ,"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C...","[12, 12]","I homeschool (unschool) my son, and the Magic School Bus series is GREAT for teaching kids science. We have 4 DVD sets and a few VHS's.If you're unfamiliar with the premise, the central characters are Ms. Frizzle (a teacher), her class, Liz the lizard and the Bus. Ms. Frizzle takes her class on crazy field trips, where Bus--and sometimes the kids!--experience a transformation so they can get closer to the action. (For example, become a bee or turning into water droplets.)One of our most recent purchases was Bugs, Bugs, Bugs! and it's excellent as always. These three episodes are:*In a Beehive - Exploring bee behavior and a beehive*Gets Ants in Its Pants - Learning about the industrial world of ants*Butterfly and the Bog Beast - Metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterflyThere is also a few bonus features:*Bug Challenges*Find the Camouflage Butterflies*Ant OlympicsThis CD runs about 82 minutes and is supposedly geared towards children 3-8. Personally, I think the age-appropriate range is more like 6-10 because of the complex concepts introduced.However, if younger kids enjoy it--more power to them! It certainly can't hurt to introduce science to younger kids if the Magic School Bus holds their interest.My 8-year old son really enjoys the series now (he didn't get into it when he was younger), so I use the Magic School Bus series to supplement our learning/experimenting with science principles.",5,"Bees, Ants and Butterflies",1181260800,"06 8, 2007",2007,1415,"['homeschool', 'unschool', 'son', 'Magic', 'School', 'Bus', 'series', 'GREAT', 'teaching', 'kids', 'science', 'have', '4', 'DVD', 'sets', 'few', ""VHS's.If"", ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'premise', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'Ms.', 'Frizzle', 'teacher', 'class', 'Liz', 'lizard', 'Bus', 'Ms.', 'Frizzle', 'class', 'crazy', 'field', 'trips', 'where', 'Bus', 'sometimes', 'kids', 'experience', 'transformation', 'can', 'get', 'closer', 'action', 'example', 'become', 'bee', 'turning', 'water', 'droplets', 'One', 'most', 'recent', 'purchases', 'was', 'Bugs', 'Bugs', 'Bugs', 'excellent', 'always', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', '*In', 'Beehive', 'Exploring', 'bee', 'behavior', 'beehive*Gets', 'Ants', 'Pants', 'Learning', 'industrial', 'world', 'ants*Butterfly', 'Bog', 'Beast', 'Metamorphosis', 'caterpillar', 'butterflyThere', 'also', 'few', 'bonus', 'features', '*Bug', 'Camouflage', 'Butterflies*Ant', 'OlympicsThis', 'CD', '82', 'minutes', 'supposedly', 'geared', 'towards', 'children', '3-8', 'Personally', 'think', 'age-appropriate', 'range', 'more', '6-10', 'complex', 'concepts', 'introduced.However', 'younger', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'more', 'power', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'introduce', 'science', 'younger', 'kids', 'Magic', 'School', 'Bus', 'interest.My', '8-year', 'old', 'son', 'really', 'series', 'now', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'so', 'use', 'Magic', 'School', 'Bus', 'series', 'supplement', 'learning/experimenting', 'science', 'principles']","Magic School Bus - Bugs, Bugs, Bugs"
825680,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B00027JYCQ,PeaTee,"[16, 17]","The previous reviewer summed up the stories on this DVD very well so I will only add that all of the MSB shows are great (especially when compared to what else is out there).I started watching these with my children when they were two and four.  Sure they miss out on some of the finer scientific fine points, but I am *sure* that they are gaining a foundation in a variety of scientific topics.  Things that we can *build upon* later.For example, I couldn't find my car keys and I asked my 5 year-old daughter if  she had seen them.  She then began gyrating around-much to my confusion.  When I asked her `what the heck ` she was doing, she answered that she was `dancing' out the directions to them the way that bees do.  LOL.In any case, after watching this show, we go outside and 'dissect' some flowers.  Or we do something like grow beans in a glass cup so that what we have seen in the show is reinforced.Five Stars.
