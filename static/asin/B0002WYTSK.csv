I bought it inspite of the fact that it features the voice of Whoopi Goldberg, because I collect and watch as many versions as I can, and because it features the voice of Tim Curry, whose work I do admire.I thought Scrooge's dog was a cute addition to the classic tale, but I stopped watching it when the Ghost of Christmas Present appeared looking like Oprah Winfrey in a gigantic green bathrobe, and sounding like Dame Edna.  Apparently, there was a disconnect between the cover illustrator and the animated graphics department, because the Ghost of Christmas Present is white on the cover, but black in the movie.Too disturbing!  The only version I've seen more disturbing than this one is Tchaikovsky's ""Nutcracker Christmas Story,"" which features men in thongs, one of them with devil horns on his forehead, cracking a whip at the others.",2,"Second Most Disturbing Version of ""A Christmas Carol""",1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,931,"['second', 'most', 'disturbing', 'version', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'bought', 'inspite', 'fact', 'voice', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'collect', 'watch', 'many', 'versions', 'can', 'voice', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'work', 'do', 'admire.I', 'thought', 'Scrooge', 'dog', 'was', 'cute', 'addition', 'classic', 'tale', 'stopped', 'watching', 'when', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Present', 'appeared', 'looking', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'gigantic', 'green', 'bathrobe', 'sounding', 'Dame', 'Edna', 'Apparently', 'was', 'disconnect', 'cover', 'illustrator', 'animated', 'graphics', 'department', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Present', 'white', 'cover', 'black', 'movie.Too', 'disturbing', 'only', 'version', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'disturbing', 'one', 'Tchaikovsky', 'Nutcracker', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'men', 'thongs', 'one', 'devil', 'horns', 'forehead', 'cracking', 'whip', 'others']",N/A
