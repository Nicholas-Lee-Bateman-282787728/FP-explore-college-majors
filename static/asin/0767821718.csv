I have never seen Pfeiffer give an average performance and I am including Grease 2, lol. The film is somewhat average but a lot of families deal with a child been abducted so I think a lot of people could relate to this film. Treat Williams and Whoopi Goldberg also star, they are great too in this. I am rating this film rather high because of Pfeiffer, she's one of my favorites!",4,Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing!,1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,520,"['Deep', 'End', 'Ocean', 'weepy', 'drama', 'thanks', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'brilliant', 'realistic', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Pfeiffer', 'give', 'average', 'performance', 'am', 'including', 'Grease', '2', 'lol', 'film', 'somewhat', 'average', 'lot', 'families', 'deal', 'child', 'been', 'abducted', 'so', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'could', 'relate', 'film', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'also', 'star', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'am', 'rating', 'film', 'rather', 'high', 'Pfeiffer', 'one', 'favorites']",N/A

16482,A2582KMXLK2P06,0767821718,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","What makes the Deep End of the Ocean shine bright is in the way the storyline gradually improves as it goes along, and you will find that your emotions are harder to keep under control as it happens.  The writing is mostly good with a few exceptions, and the way the story keeps you attached to the TV screen is definitely one of the positives.  I seriously wasn't expecting such a phenomenal performance by all the actors and actresses involved.  Putting into words what makes this movie so great is very difficult since there's so much attention to emotions and specifically, crying (not exactly tears of sadness either, which is what's so surprising).With all that said, I can't help but think Michelle Pfieffer's character was slightly and oddly out of whack when she first reacted to her young son getting kidnapped in a crowded area.  Her immediate reaction was confusion and only a slight bit of worry.  Considering how many people were around, and given the fact her son was only 4 years old, it's hard to believe she wouldn't freak out more.  As harsh as this might sound, I'm almost glad she eventually responded with a nervous breakdown when the reality set in that her son is actually missing.  This scene saves the whole segment.I suppose as the weeks turn into months and the months turn into years, it's somewhat normal for a mother (and father) to move on by removing pictures of their child and pretending the child was never in their lives (or that the child was in their lives at one point, but recognize they are now a distant memory).  Then again... I've never been in such a situation (kidnapped son or daughter) so I can't say I would have responded the same way.  Given how I usually keep pictures on the living room hutch and never take them down, I suppose I'd have kept the pictures if he were my child.  I wasn't sure if Michelle's character was throwing away pictures of her son in the trashcan or, since she was a photographer, throwing away pictures of the things she used to find meaningful (since she's now depressed and her perception has faded).  This is where it gets confusing- Michelle's character was secluded and depressed... I think.  I'm not 100% sure she was.  Her character felt off some of the time so her behavior was hard to understand.Even more unusual is the father who was more than ready to move on with business related stuff.  The oldest son -who was standing directly beside his younger brother in that crowded area during the kidnapping- was reacting even more unusually by not showing even the least bit of concern (as evident by the way he was playing his Game Boy at the breakfast table and showing signs of happiness or rather expressing feelings that ""It's no big deal"").  This is more the result of bad writing I believe.  The kid probably should have felt *somewhat* responsible for his brothers disappearance despite his young age.  We *do* find out later he was more than old enough to understand what he'd done wrong however.  Of course it could be argued that what Michelle did was wrong too- leaving two young boys alone for a moment and not being confident enough to know exactly where they were standing amongst the chaotic crowd.  That's not a smart parenting decision.  Then again, leaving kids alone and assuming no harm will be done is a common feeling among many people so I can't really blame her there.Michelle's character eventually settles into a ""Oh that makes sense- that's how a mother should react to such a traumatic situation"" but the father and oldest son were never really given the same kind of believable treatment, which makes me think the writers intended to focus the film around Michell Pfieffer's character and reactions all along.  Hey, she was the most popular actor/actress the time it was released after all.Anyway, when the kidnapped son miraculously comes home under the most hard to believe circumstances (he was living 2 blocks away the whole time?) this is when I'm certainly confident in giving this film a solid 5-star rating.  The kidnapped son was the best actor in the entire movie.  Whether it be his reaction to having to move away from the man he once called his father and suddenly having to radically change his lifestyle with his real family (that he barely remembers and therefore feels out of place) or the way his upbeat personality has a knack for bringing out the raw emotions in his older brother and mother, he definitely steals the show here.  No doubt about it.Oh and what's up with that scene where the parents were fighting and the oldest boy walks up to his baby sisters crib and smuggles her mouth?  I THINK the reason is because he wanted her to cry so their parents would stop fighting and quickly run to the bedroom, but the boy could have found a better way of ending that argument than putting his sisters health in danger.  I guess it can be chalked up to ""Kids will be kids"" and do silly irrational things.Overall, an emotionally award-winning performance all around.",5,"wow, surprisingly awesome",1346630400,"09 3,

16488,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0767821718,D. Litton,"[18, 20]","&quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot; is one of the best movies of 1999, complex and moving, with truly emotional characters played by actors who carry the weight of the story on their shoulders with incredible ease and make it heartwarming and believable. The movie is actually two different stories, one being a family's emotional coming-to-terms with a missing child, and then the pain and stress they must endure when he shows up nine years later.On her way to her high school reunion, Beth Cappadora is told by her husband that if her head wasn't attached to her, she would lose it quickly. This provides a short laugh, while also setting up what is to come. At the reunion, she leaves her three-year-old son Ben in the care of his older brother Vincent, only to come back moments later and realize that he is gone. Hysterics grow, and after a thorough search of the building, he is nowhere to be found. Surrounded by family and friends, Beth begins to cope with her mistake as the community gets involved in the search for Ben, without success. Resigned to the fact that he will never be found, she returns home, and while the first steps to coping with what has happened are rocky, the family seems to be getting along well after the passage of nine years. They have moved to a new house in a new town, her husband has the restaurant he always wanted... A knock on the door turns everything upside down. Beth immediately recognizes the boy as her son, and is relieved and confused that he lives only two blocks away from their new residence. The authorities get involved, and soon Ben is taken from the only home he can remember and placed in a new and somewhat emotionally frightening setting where he is called by a name he does not know and lives with people he does not remember or feel much for.What makes this movie work for me is the complexity of the story as well as the characters, and the magnificence in which the two blend together. The first part of the story admittedly is the more believable of the two, diving into the emotions of the family as they must cope with the grief of the missing Ben. Beth's reaction to her son's disappearance is superbly acted out by Michelle Pheiffer, who carries it like she's been through it in reality. The first half of the movie shows her dealing with the pain in the only way she knows how: shutting everyone else out, ignoring the optimism of life that is to be explored. This causes her to become somewhat distanced from her husband, played by Treat Williams, and her oldest son, who feels the great weight of responsibility set in when he must take care of his little sister while his parents argue.The second half of the movie is the more emotional of the two, however, as the family, who is just beginning to enjoy life, find their son and bring him back home. There is an unmistakable truth in what occurs emotionally between the two brothers, Vincent and Ben, who goes by Sam. Vincent, who has just begun to gain the attention he never got from his parents, feels threatened by the presence of Ben, and does everything he can to make his long-lost sibling feel unwelcome. This, accompanied by the emotional baggage toted by the family in their struggle to be happy together all conspire to make the movie more heartfelt, warming and true.Some of the best acting talent ever has gone into the making of this movie, which is heavily called for considering the amount of emotion that needs to be conveyed to the audience. Michelle Pheiffer is Beth Cappadora, and in this role, she is literally required to become her character. She does this with superb talent, playing Beth as an overall emotional person with a strong will hidden beneath her sorrows. Treat Williams makes the perfect supportive husband, as well as a father who just wants things to be like he always imagined for his family. Ben's return has a big effect on him, and when he puts his foot down about what the family does together, the acting is nothing short of amazing. Jackson does a great job in playing the older brother Vincent, as well as the wild-child teenager who gets into a lot of trouble. Whoopi Goldberg seems like a stretch as the detective working the case, but she works the camera as well with her serious demeanor.Complexity and integrity are what make a movie worth watching, and &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot; has all of this and more.

16489,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,0767821718,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE DEEP AND OF THE OCEAN (1999, 106 minutes, the most terribly mis-titled work of fiction I have ever heard of) was a kind of Hallmark Channel-style mediocre drama - but I found part way in that I was hooked on the storyline. Since I had never heard of Jacquelyn Mitchard, on whose novel this movie was based, I wanted to see the plot play out all the way. Yes, I am usually willing to swallow any excuse for acting if the story is this good.A more or less happily married couple (the dreadful combo of Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams) suffer untold agonies when their youngest of two sons gets kidnapped in Chicago, 1988. Michelle goes to pieces and needs years to recover from her ridiculous depression (I know this is a real torment, but the acting - UGH!).What is worse is the character of lesbian police detective Candy Bliss (yep, that is her name, played by Whoopi Goldberg in a part that was originally supposed to go to Oprah Winfrey). Somehow, even though the entirety of Chicago's Finest turns out to find this boy and Detective Bliss even comes close to discovering him, they find nothing. In the ensuing years, Michelle the photographer goes back to work and Treat the hyperactive restaurateur (who talks like he's been castrated) holds the family together.The adorable but rambunctious older brother Vincent (is this boy screaming ""I'm gay"" or what, played by Jonathan Jackson who is actually father of three kids today) falls into a life of juvenile delinquency, but there's a reason for that. But wait ... there's a surprise here. The kidnapped son Ben (played as an 11-year-old by the delightful Ryan Merriman) turns out to be living just 2 blocks from the tortured family. This is 9 years after the kidnapping (which sets the story in 1997) and the family just happened to have moved to Chicago 2 years earlier.What follows next is not only unbelievably stupid but in fact completely illegal from what little I do know about this sort of thing. I will not spoil what happens, but this film did move me to ponder the questions because the story itself held this production together. Is a child a 'possession' of the parents, to be fought over and bandied about, is a child automatically to be returned to the biological family if there is innocence and the child already has an adopted family?All these queries arise, and I don't think even 1989's spectacular true storyI Know My First Name is Stevenaddressed the questions as well as this otherwise mediocre production did. The film sort of falls flat at the end, but I saw it as a rather clever end, involving perhaps the ultimate sacrifice - and not the sacrifice you might be thinking. I know the ending was preferred by Michelle Pfeiffer and others, but it did not test as well as the ending that was ultimately utilized.Pity. However, I say it is well worth the effort and will have you wondering exactly what the law is in such cases, and how the laws relate to similar cases. Having been close to a couple of families that have suffered the loss of their children, I was moved and relieved just to see this was not another film about not finding anything, or finding a corpse decades later.",3,... only because the storyline held me fast,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,3171,"['DEEP', 'AND', 'THE', 'OCEAN', '1999', '106', 'minutes', 'most', 'terribly', 'mis-titled', 'work', 'fiction', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'was', 'kind', 'Hallmark', 'Channel-style', 'mediocre', 'drama', 'found', 'part', 'way', 'was', 'hooked', 'storyline', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Jacquelyn', 'Mitchard', 'novel', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'wanted', 'see', 'plot', 'play', 'out', 'way', 'Yes', 'am', 'usually', 'willing', 'swallow', 'excuse', 'acting', 'story', 'good.A', 'more', 'less', 'happily', 'married', 'couple', 'dreadful', 'combo', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'suffer', 'untold', 'agonies', 'when', 'youngest', 'two', 'sons', 'kidnapped', 'Chicago', '1988', 'Michelle', 'pieces', 'needs', 'years', 'recover', 'ridiculous', 'depression', 'know', 'real', 'torment', 'acting', 'UGH', '.What', 'worse', 'character', 'lesbian', 'police', 'detective', 'Candy', 'Bliss', 'yep', 'name', 'played', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'part', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'go', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'Somehow', 'even', 'entirety', 'Chicago', 'Finest', 'out', 'find', 'boy', 'Detective', 'Bliss', 'even', 'close', 'discovering', 'find', 'nothing', 'ensuing', 'years', 'Michelle', 'photographer', 'back', 'work', 'Treat', 'hyperactive', 'restaurateur', 'who', 'talks', 'been', 'castrated', 'family', 'together.The', 'adorable', 'rambunctious', 'older', 'brother', 'Vincent', 'boy', 'screaming', ""'m"", 'gay', 'what', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Jackson', 'who', 'actually', 'father', 'three', 'kids', 'today', 'life', 'juvenile', 'delinquency', 'reason', 'wait', 'surprise', 'here', 'kidnapped', 'son', 'Ben', 'played', '11-year-old', 'delightful', 'Ryan', 'Merriman', 'out', 'be', 'living', 'just', '2', 'blocks', 'tortured', 'family', '9', 'years', 'kidnapping', 'story', '1997', 'family', 'just', 'happened', 'have', 'moved', 'Chicago', '2', 'years', 'earlier.What', 'next', 'not', 'only', 'unbelievably', 'stupid', 'fact', 'completely', 'illegal', 'what', 'little', 'do', 'know', 'sort', 'thing', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'what', 'film', 'did', 'move', 'ponder', 'questions', 'story', 'held', 'production', 'together', 'child', ""'possession"", 'parents', 'be', 'fought', 'bandied', 'child', 'automatically', 'be', 'returned', 'biological', 'family', 'innocence', 'child', 'already', 'adopted', 'family', 'queries', 'arise', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', '1989', 'spectacular', 'true', 'storyI', 'Know', 'My', 'First', 'Name', 'Stevenaddressed', 'questions', 'as', 'well', 'otherwise', 'mediocre', 'production', 'did', 'film', 'sort', 'falls', 'flat', 'end', 'saw', 'rather', 'clever', 'end', 'involving', 'perhaps', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'might', 'be', 'thinking', 'know', 'ending', 'was', 'preferred', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'others', 'did', 'not', 'test', 'as', 'well', 'ending', 'was', 'ultimately', 'utilized.Pity', 'However', 'say', 'well', 'effort', 'will', 'have', 'wondering', 'exactly', 'what', 'law', 'such', 'cases', 'how', 'laws', 'relate', 'similar', 'cases', 'Having', 'been', 'close', 'couple', 'families', 'have', 'suffered', 'loss', 'children', 'was', 'moved', 'relieved', 'just', 'see', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'not', 'finding', 'anything', 'finding', 'corpse', 'decades', 'later']",N/A

Michelle Pfeiffer plays distraught mother Bethy Cappadora whose three year old son Ben goes missing during her High School reunion.  If you are looking for an exciting film with lots of action then don't watch this.  &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot; is an intelligent film about a family coming to terms with the loss of their child and then his miraculous recovery nine years later.  Pfeiffer is excellent in her role as mother and photographer who must come to terms with her guilt of turning her back for just a moment and loosing sight of her small son.  Treat Williams gives a credible performance as her bewildered husband and Jonathan Jackson who plays Vincent, the Cappadora's oldest son at 16, is quietly believeable as a boy with a troubled conscience.  Add to this the talents of Whoopi Goldberg as a gay black Police Woman assigned to the case and you have a solid film that is both compelling and watchable.  I enjoyed &quot;Deep End of the Ocean&quot; because of its intelligence and the compassionate way it treated a very sensitive subject.

I admit I loved watching this because her performance is so spectacular.  Probably one of the best I've seen her do.  It's unfortunate that her performance wasn't in a better film, but this film is good.  You can't compare it to the book which so many are doing.  I think by this time we all know a movie will never be as good as a book.  This could've been a lifetime made for movie, but instead it was a feature film.Michelle plays Beth Cappadora who heads to her high school reunion with her kids only to have her youngest child abducted.  We're taken into the whole gritty scenario of what would you do if this happened to you?  How would you react if your child is missing for 15 minutes and then two hours later and no sign of him and the police are there.  You would be a mess!  How would you be each day thereafter with no sign of him.  Imagine it.  Nine years goes by and the kid is more grown up and shows up at her front door to mow her lawn.  He matches the description of the projected images that the FBI made him out to look as he got older.  I won't tell you what happens, but you get the drift of the turmoil this poor family goes through.  Michelle falls into the rabbit hole of emotions giving us some of her most brilliant acting work on screen.  The movie is tragic and even more tragic that it wasn't more seen.

It's pretty true to the novel, and the few things that were changed for the film aren't all that important. I think the biggest difference between the book and the movie is that the character of Beth is much more toned-down and sympathetic on the big screen than she is on paper. Mitchard's version of the character is more interesting and complex, but I can see why the producers probably thought it wouldn't do well on the big screen. Pfeiffer delivers a strong performance, as does Jonathan Jackson, who plays the oldest Cappadora son, Vincent. The only casting decision that left me puzzled is Whoopi Goldberg, who is probably the last person on earth I would have picked to play Detective Candy Bliss, but oh well.Bottom line: This is a good, solid film.

The premise  of the story is so compelling that the audience can't help but be drawn  emotionally into the intense plight facing this family.Michelle  Pfeiffer portrays a young photographer, living an idyllic life in Madison,  Wisconsin with a loving and devoted husband (Treat Williams) and three  adorable young children. While in Chicago for a class reunion, every  parent's ultimate nightmare becomes a reality: her middle child  unaccountably disappears in the middle of a crowded hotel lobby. These  scenes, in which she undergoes a sense of mounting panic as well as a  crushing sense of guilt and personal self-doubt, are more terrifying than  anything contained in a conventional &quot;horror&quot; film. We cringe too  as the investigators come up against one blank wall after another,  empathizing fully with a mother driven to desperation in the face of the  unspeakable.As months pass, the family attempts to cope with the  horrific reality of their situation and the film promises to become an  insightful study of the effects of the loss, fear and guilt that  accompanies the disappearance of a child. But then the film goes agley as  it moves ahead a decade and the child is miraculously discovered living a  mere few blocks away, happily ensconced with a man first thought to be a  kidnapper then revealed as an innocent pawn in an abduction scheme gone  awry. As the child moves in with his &quot;true&quot; parents, the  screenplay settles into a bland T.V. movie formula, in which each character  must act out his or her customary little drama with little heed given to  believability or originality. Instead of exploring the various stages a  family goes through in the wake of a devastating loss, the film cheats us  by coming through with an unconvincingly upbeat resolution. It becomes  quite clear that the filmmakers are far more concerned with jerking out  tears than with providing a truly thoughtprovoking exploration of its  theme. This is a shame because the actors (especially Pfeiffer) handle  their roles admirably. Only Whoopi Goldberg, in a totally thankless role as  a compassionate investigator of missing children, seems hopelessly miscast.  This film might well have been a labor of love for her (and indeed for  everyone involved), but for the audience, it only makes one sigh over how  much better it might have been.",2,film with potential falls apart,964396800,"07 24, 2000",2000,2565,"['far', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'days', 'quot', 'Deep', 'End', 'Ocean', 'quot', 'promisingly', 'then', 'midway', 'crushing', 'weight', 'heavyhanded', 'plot', 'mechanics', 'incredibility', 'sentimentality', 'premise', 'story', 'so', 'compelling', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'drawn', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'plight', 'facing', 'family.Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'young', 'photographer', 'living', 'idyllic', 'life', 'Madison', 'Wisconsin', 'loving', 'devoted', 'husband', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'three', 'adorable', 'young', 'children', 'Chicago', 'class', 'reunion', 'parent', 'ultimate', 'nightmare', 'reality', 'middle', 'child', 'unaccountably', 'middle', 'crowded', 'hotel', 'lobby', 'scenes', 'sense', 'mounting', 'panic', 'as', 'well', 'crushing', 'sense', 'guilt', 'personal', 'self-doubt', 'are', 'more', 'terrifying', 'anything', 'contained', 'conventional', 'quot', 'horror', 'quot', 'film', 'cringe', 'too', 'investigators', 'come', 'up', 'one', 'blank', 'wall', 'empathizing', 'fully', 'mother', 'driven', 'desperation', 'face', 'unspeakable.As', 'months', 'pass', 'family', 'cope', 'horrific', 'reality', 'situation', 'film', 'become', 'insightful', 'study', 'effects', 'loss', 'fear', 'guilt', 'disappearance', 'child', 'then', 'film', 'agley', 'ahead', 'decade', 'child', 'miraculously', 'discovered', 'living', 'mere', 'few', 'blocks', 'away', 'happily', 'ensconced', 'man', 'first', 'thought', 'be', 'kidnapper', 'then', 'revealed', 'innocent', 'pawn', 'abduction', 'scheme', 'gone', 'awry', 'child', 'moves', 'quot', 'true', 'quot', 'parents', 'screenplay', 'bland', 'T.V', 'movie', 'formula', 'character', 'must', 'act', 'out', 'customary', 'little', 'drama', 'little', 'heed', 'given', 'believability', 'originality', 'Instead', 'exploring', 'various', 'family', 'wake', 'devastating', 'loss', 'film', 'cheats', 'coming', 'unconvincingly', 'upbeat', 'resolution', 'quite', 'clear', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'concerned', 'jerking', 'out', 'tears', 'providing', 'truly', 'thoughtprovoking', 'exploration', 'theme', 'shame', 'actors', 'especially', 'Pfeiffer', 'handle', 'roles', 'admirably', 'Only', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'totally', 'thankless', 'role', 'compassionate', 'investigator', 'missing', 'children', 'hopelessly', 'miscast', 'film', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'labor', 'love', 'indeed', 'everyone', 'involved', 'audience', 'only', 'one', 'sigh', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'might', 'have', 'been']",N/A
