As my kids are growing up on things like `Spongebob' I find myself wishing that they would watch the shows of my youth.  So, I've been trying to get them hooked on `The Rugrats' and for the most part it has worked.  They still prefer these newer, flashier and more obnoxious shows, but it's a work in progress.  So, while on vacation this past week I decided to rent `The Rugrats Movie' to see if my kids would enjoy it.  I personally, despite growing up on the show, have never seen this.Not every cartoon is meant to be expanded past the delightful ten minutes they get on television.I still love these characters and the witty dialog is great, even here, but the plot here was so nonexistent and the development was just dull.  The film just had no impact whatsoever, and while my kids seemed interested and enjoyed it, it was lost on me (and I'm the one who really loves the show).  I mean, this is really bad, right?  The musical numbers were awful, the storyline was simplistic and silly at best and while the character arc for young Tommy was endearing, it was so skeletal and it lacked any real bite.  It just laid there and died in your arms.  No pulse.  No reason to watch it again.

Alongside ""Ed, Edd, 'n' Eddy"" (another spectacular animated series) it is one of the most nostalgic cartoons I know, filled with happy memories and laughter. However, this film is nothing special.It is just another boring, long adventure film spiced here and there with typical silly Rugrats jokes, its moments of conflict, humor, tear-jerkers, search scenes, and, finally, the happy ending for everybody. The plot moves slowly and is boring to sit through. Instead of the Rugrats' usual domestic environment where their imaginations roam free, engulfing themselves in wild, crazy fantasy sequences devoid of any worldly limitations, they are bound by the colorless, dreary environment. This adventure is not their imagination. It is real, meaning that it is limited by all the same things that bind us down in the real world. It is family friendly, true, but predictable and you know that the parents are going to find the babies anyway at the ending, and everything will be sunshine and rainbows. However, if you want a good wholesome family film, purchase Rugrats in Paris (the most incredible and original of all) or the cross-over Rugrats go Wild, which isn't as good but still okay and entertaining, or, better yet, buy the better, more colorful episodes of Rugrats themselves.

129301,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,0792155203,S. Rhodes,"[8, 8]","As I write this review I can't help but remember when I loved the Rugrats.  It was once my favorite show in television as a kid.  And when the movie came out in theaters I was more excited than anyone would've imagined.  I was a huge fan.  The TV show has decreased in quality, but the movie still remains solid.  It introduced a new character to the series, and to this day still remains the greatest adventure that the rugrats have gone on.Didi has recently found out she's pregnant, and that means Tommy is getting a baby brother.  When Tommy's new brother Dil is born, things around the house change.  Dil begins to receive a bit more attention than Tommy, and he's always loud and obnoxious... the way Tommy used to be when he was first born.  Phil, Lil, and Chuckie can't stand him and neither can Angelica.In the meantime, Stewie has made a new invention.  A Reptar mobile (Reptar is the Rugrats version of ""Godzilla"" and the babies' hero).  When Stu and Didi head out for a while, they leave the kids home alone with Grandpa.  If you've watched the show you know Grandpa is not a good baby sitter... he always falls asleep, and that's what he does here.The babies see this Reptar mobile and decide to hop inside and play around.  Angelica (the rambuncious three year old brat) is trying to watch her show and so she is very annoyed.  She gives the babies the boot (literally) and the Reptar wagon suddenly slides out the front door.  Tommy has little idea how to control it, and neither do his friends.  Phil and Lil, however, don't see it as such a bad thing.  To them it's a chance to take new-born baby Dil back to the hospital.With the babies gone, Angelica can finally find peace... except there's a problem.  When she gave the babies the boot they took her favorite doll Cynthia with them!  Now Angelica decides she must find them, and so she saddles up the family dog, Spike.  And Spike ends up running out the front door... dragging Angelica along.The result?  The babies getting lost in the forest far away from home.  When the parents find out, they go on a large search for the babies.I suppose what got me to really like this movie was the adventure of it.  The little imagination of these babies is amazing!  The movie even begins with a little rendition of ""Indiana Jones"" as they're actually exploring thier house.  But when they really AREN'T in a place that's their home, you can see just how brave they get.Never mind how stupid the parents are (they NEVER learn from leaving the babies with Grandpa), the adventure is exciting.  Especially when Phil and Lil manage to let a bunch of monkey's take Dil away.  Soon Tommy really IS the one responsible for his brother.  The movie is funny in many places, and it's songs are enlightening.  Any child will enjoy this movie to death.Unlike it's sequel, the babies get into some trouble that isn't too far beyond their control.  By that I mean, the Reptar mobile is just a wagon, and not some HUGE GIGANTIC THING DESTROYING THE CITY!  This adventure is more REAL than in the sequel, ""Rugrats in Paris"".And while Dil isn't the most likeable character, it's unrealistic to think he can do as much as the other babies can (he can't walk, mind you).  It would help if Dil was as adventureous as his brother, but considering he's only a few weeks old, we can get by.The animation is top notch, and very vivid and vibrant.  Much better than the television show ever was.  It's just incredible.If there were problems I'd say it's this: It is certainly not a movie for grown ups.  If you grew up with the Rugrats as I did, you will probably like this movie.  However, grown ups who didn't grow up with the Rugrats, will be annoyed by their kids loving to watch the film.  It is clearly aimed at the younger audience.It's a great movie.  Especially for your kids, and especially for nostalgia.  This was an incredible movie eight years ago, and remains a good movie for your kids today.",4,The Rugrats before the decline,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,3947,"['write', 'review', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'remember', 'when', 'loved', 'Rugrats', 'was', 'once', 'favorite', 'show', 'television', 'kid', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'was', 'more', 'excited', 'anyone', 'would', ""'ve"", 'imagined', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'TV', 'show', 'decreased', 'quality', 'movie', 'still', 'solid', 'introduced', 'new', 'character', 'series', 'day', 'still', 'greatest', 'adventure', 'rugrats', 'have', 'gone', 'on.Didi', 'recently', 'found', 'out', 'pregnant', 'Tommy', 'getting', 'baby', 'brother', 'When', 'Tommy', 'new', 'brother', 'Dil', 'born', 'things', 'house', 'change', 'Dil', 'receive', 'bit', 'more', 'attention', 'Tommy', 'always', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'way', 'Tommy', 'used', 'be', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'born', 'Phil', 'Lil', 'Chuckie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'can', 'Angelica.In', 'meantime', 'Stewie', 'made', 'new', 'invention', 'Reptar', 'mobile', 'Reptar', 'Rugrats', 'version', 'Godzilla', 'babies', 'hero', 'When', 'Stu', 'Didi', 'head', 'out', 'while', 'leave', 'kids', 'home', 'alone', 'Grandpa', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'show', 'know', 'Grandpa', 'not', 'good', 'baby', 'sitter', 'always', 'asleep', 'what', 'here.The', 'babies', 'see', 'Reptar', 'mobile', 'decide', 'hop', 'inside', 'play', 'around', 'Angelica', 'rambuncious', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'brat', 'trying', 'watch', 'show', 'so', 'very', 'annoyed', 'babies', 'boot', 'literally', 'Reptar', 'wagon', 'suddenly', 'out', 'front', 'door', 'Tommy', 'little', 'idea', 'how', 'control', 'neither', 'do', 'friends', 'Phil', 'Lil', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'chance', 'take', 'new-born', 'baby', 'Dil', 'back', 'hospital.With', 'babies', 'gone', 'Angelica', 'can', 'finally', 'find', 'peace', 'problem', 'When', 'gave', 'babies', 'boot', 'took', 'favorite', 'doll', 'Cynthia', 'Now', 'Angelica', 'must', 'find', 'so', 'family', 'dog', 'Spike', 'Spike', 'up', 'running', 'out', 'front', 'door', 'dragging', 'Angelica', 'along.The', 'result', 'babies', 'getting', 'lost', 'forest', 'far', 'away', 'home', 'When', 'parents', 'find', 'out', 'go', 'large', 'search', 'babies.I', 'suppose', 'what', 'got', 'really', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'adventure', 'little', 'imagination', 'babies', 'amazing', 'movie', 'even', 'little', 'rendition', 'Indiana', 'Jones', ""'re"", 'actually', 'exploring', 'thier', 'house', 'when', 'really', 'ARE', ""N'T"", 'place', 'home', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'brave', 'get.Never', 'mind', 'how', 'stupid', 'parents', 'are', 'NEVER', 'learn', 'leaving', 'babies', 'Grandpa', 'adventure', 'exciting', 'Especially', 'when', 'Phil', 'Lil', 'manage', 'let', 'bunch', 'monkey', 'take', 'Dil', 'away', 'Soon', 'Tommy', 'really', 'one', 'responsible', 'brother', 'movie', 'funny', 'many', 'places', 'songs', 'are', 'enlightening', 'child', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'death.Unlike', 'sequel', 'babies', 'get', 'trouble', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'control', 'mean', 'Reptar', 'mobile', 'just', 'wagon', 'not', 'HUGE', 'GIGANTIC', 'THING', 'DESTROYING', 'THE', 'CITY', 'adventure', 'more', 'REAL', 'sequel', 'Rugrats', 'Paris', '.And', 'Dil', ""n't"", 'most', 'likeable', 'character', 'unrealistic', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'babies', 'can', 'ca', ""n't"", 'walk', 'mind', 'would', 'help', 'Dil', 'was', 'as', 'adventureous', 'brother', 'considering', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'old', 'can', 'get', 'by.The', 'animation', 'top', 'notch', 'very', 'vivid', 'vibrant', 'Much', 'better', 'television', 'show', 'ever', 'was', 'just', 'incredible.If', 'were', 'problems', ""'d"", 'say', 'certainly', 'not', 'movie', 'grown', 'ups', 'grew', 'up', 'Rugrats', 'did', 'will', 'probably', 'movie', 'However', 'grown', 'ups', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'Rugrats', 'will', 'be', 'annoyed', 'kids', 'loving', 'watch', 'film', 'clearly', 'aimed', 'younger', 'audience.It', 'great', 'movie', 'Especially', 'kids', 'especially', 'nostalgia', 'was', 'incredible', 'movie', 'eight', 'years', 'ago', 'good', 'movie', 'kids', 'today']",N/A

Personally, I'm of the view that if you gave it an honest shot but just couldn't make it all the way to the end, it's okay to say so.I did sit down and try to watch this. Twice. Both times I got about 30 to 40 minutes in before I just couldn't keep going. From what I did see, it seemed almost a case study on how not to turn a TV show into a feature length film.Basically, all the characters do exactly the same things they do on the TV show. It's just that the writers try to give them more ""serious"" problems to tackle. Something to try to put everyone a little out of their comfort zone. To create the illusion that this time, things might not quite work out. Or at least to give our heroes problems that might plausibly take more than half an hour (or 11 minutes) to resolve.Somehow, like so many TV show to feature film conversions, it just doesn't work. Maybe half an hour (or 11 minutes) of watching the rugrats do their tricks is enough. A format that makes perfect sense as a half hour TV show doesn't often translate terribly well to feature length. I'm not even sure why myself. I'd welcome comments on this review from anyone with a theory about this.But whatever the reason, somehow... it just doesn't.Theo.",2,"Well, I tried...",1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,1338,"['Opinion', 'here', 'Amazon', 'divided', 'okay', 'review', 'book', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'end', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'view', 'gave', 'honest', 'shot', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'way', 'end', 'okay', 'say', 'so.I', 'did', 'sit', 'down', 'try', 'watch', 'Twice', 'Both', 'times', 'got', 'about', '30', '40', 'minutes', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'going', 'what', 'did', 'see', 'seemed', 'almost', 'case', 'study', 'how', 'not', 'turn', 'TV', 'show', 'feature', 'length', 'film.Basically', 'characters', 'do', 'exactly', 'same', 'things', 'do', 'TV', 'show', 'just', 'writers', 'try', 'give', 'more', 'serious', 'problems', 'tackle', 'Something', 'try', 'put', 'everyone', 'little', 'comfort', 'zone', 'create', 'illusion', 'time', 'things', 'might', 'not', 'quite', 'work', 'out', 'least', 'give', 'heroes', 'problems', 'might', 'plausibly', 'take', 'more', 'hour', '11', 'minutes', 'resolve.Somehow', 'so', 'many', 'TV', 'show', 'feature', 'film', 'conversions', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'Maybe', 'hour', '11', 'minutes', 'watching', 'rugrats', 'do', 'tricks', 'enough', 'format', 'perfect', 'sense', 'half', 'hour', 'TV', 'show', ""n't"", 'often', 'translate', 'terribly', 'well', 'feature', 'length', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'why', ""'d"", 'welcome', 'comments', 'review', 'anyone', 'theory', 'this.But', 'reason', 'somehow', 'just', ""doesn't.Theo""]",N/A

129304,A4JHEO7H330AF,0792155203,Tom Brody,"[2, 3]","The artwork is inspiring, especially depictions of forests.  There is plenty of action.  The storyline appears to be good for kids.  But there is a little problem.  The authors of the script and storyline are not particularly intelligent.  In other words, essentially every minute of the story is contrived and forced.  Most of the picture consists of chase scenes, moving from here to there, and repeated boring attempts at cliff-hangers.The movie seems to start off right.  We see a parody of an Indiana Jones movie, where the cartoon character children enter an underground temple and attempt to snatch a golden chalice.  They are chased off by a huge rolling ball.  The ground cracks open, and the children manage to escape.  From there, it all goes downhill.  The children find themselves in a box, and the box is accidently shipped overland by a truck, and the truck gets in an accident and the children are dumped into a ravine somewhere in the wilderness.  There is a dangerous wolf.  The children manage to escape in a boat, but the boat approaches a waterfall (ho-hum).  Children will not be amused by the repeated jokes about urinating.Everything in this movie is derived or forced.  The script writers failed to ask themselves, ""Will the viewer care about what happens at this or that point in the storyline?""  The script writers failed to ask, ""Will the viewer actually notice that mere commotion by the cartoon characters is taking the place of substance?""The movie is worse than the feature length SIMPSONS movie, which itself lacks the cleverness of the SIMPSONS T.V. episodes.  The RUGRATS movie is worse than the feature length SPONGE BOB movie, a movie and T.V. show characterized by a unique brand of zaniness.The only good thing I can say about THE RUGRATS is that the artwork is original, and somewhat better than the artwork of the SIMPSONS or SPONGE BOB.  TWO STARS.For those with an interest in movies for little kids, I might recommend the LEAVE IT TO BEAVER black and white television series, the splendid ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE color movie (great cameo by Whoopi Goldberg), the Disney movie MERLIN JONES (with America's sweetheart, Annette), and the complete first season of THE FLINTSTONES.  I think we might all agree that THE FLINTSTONES T.V. show is not particularly clever or intelligent, but at least there are actual stories, and at least the concepts in the Flintstones (anachronisms) are creative and original.  Also, BEAVER, MERLIN JONES, THE FLINTSTONES, and ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE do not contain any toilet humor.",2,Disappointing.,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2549,"['artwork', 'inspiring', 'especially', 'depictions', 'forests', 'plenty', 'action', 'storyline', 'be', 'good', 'kids', 'little', 'problem', 'authors', 'script', 'storyline', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'intelligent', 'other', 'words', 'essentially', 'minute', 'story', 'contrived', 'forced', 'Most', 'picture', 'chase', 'scenes', 'moving', 'here', 'there', 'repeated', 'boring', 'attempts', 'cliff-hangers.The', 'movie', 'start', 'off', 'right', 'see', 'parody', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'movie', 'where', 'cartoon', 'character', 'children', 'enter', 'underground', 'temple', 'attempt', 'snatch', 'golden', 'chalice', 'are', 'chased', 'off', 'huge', 'rolling', 'ball', 'ground', 'open', 'children', 'manage', 'escape', 'there', 'downhill', 'children', 'find', 'box', 'box', 'accidently', 'shipped', 'overland', 'truck', 'truck', 'accident', 'children', 'are', 'dumped', 'ravine', 'somewhere', 'wilderness', 'dangerous', 'wolf', 'children', 'manage', 'escape', 'boat', 'boat', 'waterfall', 'ho-hum', 'Children', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'amused', 'repeated', 'jokes', 'urinating.Everything', 'movie', 'derived', 'forced', 'script', 'writers', 'failed', 'ask', 'Will', 'viewer', 'care', 'what', 'point', 'storyline', 'script', 'writers', 'failed', 'ask', 'Will', 'viewer', 'actually', 'mere', 'commotion', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'taking', 'place', 'substance', 'movie', 'worse', 'feature', 'length', 'SIMPSONS', 'movie', 'cleverness', 'SIMPSONS', 'T.V', 'episodes', 'RUGRATS', 'movie', 'worse', 'feature', 'length', 'SPONGE', 'BOB', 'movie', 'movie', 'T.V', 'show', 'characterized', 'unique', 'brand', 'zaniness.The', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'RUGRATS', 'artwork', 'original', 'somewhat', 'better', 'artwork', 'SIMPSONS', 'SPONGE', 'BOB', 'TWO', 'STARS.For', 'interest', 'movies', 'little', 'kids', 'might', 'recommend', 'LEAVE', 'IT', 'TO', 'BEAVER', 'black', 'white', 'television', 'series', 'splendid', 'ROCKY', 'AND', 'BULLWINKLE', 'color', 'movie', 'great', 'cameo', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Disney', 'movie', 'MERLIN', 'JONES', 'America', 'sweetheart', 'Annette', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'THE', 'FLINTSTONES', 'think', 'might', 'agree', 'THE', 'FLINTSTONES', 'T.V', 'show', 'not', 'particularly', 'clever', 'intelligent', 'least', 'are', 'actual', 'stories', 'least', 'concepts', 'Flintstones', 'anachronisms', 'are', 'creative', 'original', 'Also', 'BEAVER', 'MERLIN', 'JONES', 'THE', 'FLINTSTONES', 'ROCKY', 'AND', 'BULLWINKLE', 'do', 'not', 'contain', 'toilet', 'humor']",N/A
