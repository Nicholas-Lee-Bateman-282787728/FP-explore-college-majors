The band sounds quite good and the 2 new songs fit well in the set list. I watched this once and decided it would be better as a CD, so I turned on my CD-R and transferred the songs to CD.  I can now listen to the show without the distraction of the added graphics.I'm giving this 4 stars only for the quality of the soundtrack. If I were to grade the video production and all the annoying graphics and other images I'd have to give it a 2.If you like Iron Butterfly then buy this item, but ONLY buy it for the songs because the video itself is poorly done.",4,This needs a CD release,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,699,"['concert', 'good', 'producer', 'added', 'graphics', 'other', 'images', 'place', 'actual', 'film', 'concert', 'band', 'quite', 'good', '2', 'new', 'songs', 'fit', 'well', 'set', 'list', 'watched', 'once', 'decided', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'CD', 'so', 'turned', 'CD-R', 'transferred', 'songs', 'CD', 'can', 'now', 'listen', 'show', 'distraction', 'added', 'graphics.I', ""'m"", 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'only', 'quality', 'soundtrack', 'were', 'grade', 'video', 'production', 'annoying', 'graphics', 'other', 'images', ""'d"", 'have', 'give', '2.If', 'Iron', 'Butterfly', 'then', 'buy', 'item', 'ONLY', 'buy', 'songs', 'video', 'poorly', 'done']",N/A
1198561,A14SE86R3GRPNC,B001GQXSA6,D. Allin,"[1, 2]","I have owned three vinyl albums, two cassettes, an 8-track, and a CD of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, which I still consider the greatest rock album ever released.  I have all their other albums as well, and listen to them regularly.  They were supposed to play at this year's San Diego County Fair, but were replaced at the last minute with KC and the Sunshine Band, of all people.  I had really hoped to see them perform live at last, and when I saw this DVD on Amazon, I figured this was going to be my best shot.  It was done in 1997, in Europe, and features three of the original band members.  They still play their instruments well, but the acid spark was missing.  There were two new songs (okay, but not memorable), and the rest were from their first 4 albums.  I was disappointed that two of the longest songs were from Metamorphosis, an album on which Doug Ingle tried to change the sound of the group.  He succeeded, and to me the album ranges from a Blood, Sweat and Tears sound to a disturbing resemblance of Spinal Tap's ""jazz fusion"" period.  On this video, their new guitarist apparently felt he had to put his stamp on the music, so the guitar solo on In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida sounds quite different from the original ablum or the Live version, and not necessarily better.  The photography of the concert was not very spectacular either, and in some cases distracting.  Ron Bushy in a wife-beater T-shirt, with his flabby arms and accountant haircut, looked very out of place, although his drumming was solid.  The interviews included were poorly edited and provide little insight into the band.  As the only available video of a live Butterfly concert, this is worth having for the die-hard fan, but it won't win over any converts.",3,"Not bad, but not great",1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,1734,"['have', 'owned', 'three', 'vinyl', 'albums', 'two', 'cassettes', '8-track', 'CD', 'In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida', 'still', 'consider', 'greatest', 'rock', 'album', 'ever', 'released', 'have', 'other', 'albums', 'well', 'listen', 'regularly', 'were', 'supposed', 'play', 'year', 'San', 'Diego', 'County', 'Fair', 'were', 'replaced', 'last', 'minute', 'KC', 'Sunshine', 'Band', 'people', 'had', 'really', 'hoped', 'see', 'perform', 'live', 'last', 'when', 'saw', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'figured', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'best', 'shot', 'was', 'done', '1997', 'Europe', 'features', 'three', 'original', 'band', 'members', 'still', 'play', 'instruments', 'well', 'acid', 'spark', 'was', 'missing', 'were', 'two', 'new', 'songs', 'okay', 'not', 'memorable', 'rest', 'were', 'first', '4', 'albums', 'was', 'disappointed', 'two', 'longest', 'songs', 'were', 'Metamorphosis', 'album', 'Doug', 'Ingle', 'tried', 'change', 'sound', 'group', 'succeeded', 'album', 'Blood', 'Sweat', 'Tears', 'sound', 'disturbing', 'resemblance', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'jazz', 'fusion', 'period', 'video', 'new', 'guitarist', 'apparently', 'felt', 'had', 'put', 'stamp', 'music', 'guitar', 'solo', 'In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida', 'quite', 'different', 'original', 'ablum', 'Live', 'version', 'not', 'necessarily', 'better', 'photography', 'concert', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'spectacular', 'cases', 'distracting', 'Ron', 'Bushy', 'wife-beater', 'T-shirt', 'flabby', 'arms', 'accountant', 'haircut', 'looked', 'very', 'place', 'drumming', 'was', 'solid', 'interviews', 'included', 'were', 'poorly', 'edited', 'provide', 'little', 'insight', 'band', 'only', 'available', 'video', 'live', 'Butterfly', 'concert', 'worth', 'having', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'over', 'converts']",N/A

What I got was a concert but alot of images on the screen that disrupted the concert footage.  When I see a concert, I don't like to see images over the players in the band trying to make the music groovy.  With Iron Butterfly you just need to see all of the musicians all of the time--the music will take you there--not image processing.  I saw the Butterfly in the sixties and also on the same tour that this was filmed--In San Ramon, Calif at a night club restaurant.  Doug Ingle was superb as well as Lee Dorman and Ron Bushy  (definitely improved drummer)  The guitar player was great--doing his own version of guitar solos with a blues touch.  The added piano player was a nice addition to the band.  But I still miss Eric Brahn--the great guitar player on the big hit--In Gadda Da Vidda --too bad he has passed away. Check him out on other Butterfly albums where he sings-not bad. This is still a must for Butterfly fans--a great concert and a great collectors album  Interviews were great and worth looking at.  Get this one--it is good but not great.!!!!",4,Butterfly Live is Fair at Best!!!!,1236729600,"03 11, 2009",2009,1132,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'hoping', 'get', 'full', 'concert', 'Butterfly', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'concert', 'alot', 'images', 'screen', 'disrupted', 'concert', 'footage', 'When', 'see', 'concert', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', 'images', 'players', 'band', 'trying', 'make', 'music', 'groovy', 'Iron', 'Butterfly', 'just', 'need', 'see', 'musicians', 'time', 'music', 'will', 'take', 'there', 'not', 'image', 'processing', 'saw', 'Butterfly', 'sixties', 'also', 'same', 'tour', 'was', 'filmed', 'San', 'Ramon', 'Calif', 'night', 'club', 'restaurant', 'Doug', 'Ingle', 'was', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'Lee', 'Dorman', 'Ron', 'Bushy', 'definitely', 'improved', 'drummer', 'guitar', 'player', 'was', 'great', 'doing', 'own', 'version', 'guitar', 'solos', 'blues', 'touch', 'added', 'piano', 'player', 'was', 'nice', 'addition', 'band', 'still', 'miss', 'Eric', 'Brahn', 'great', 'guitar', 'player', 'big', 'hit', 'Gadda', 'Da', 'Vidda', 'too', 'bad', 'passed', 'away', 'Check', 'out', 'other', 'Butterfly', 'albums', 'where', 'sings-not', 'bad', 'still', 'must', 'Butterfly', 'fans', 'great', 'concert', 'great', 'collectors', 'album', 'Interviews', 'were', 'great', 'worth', 'looking', 'Get', 'one', 'good', 'not', 'great.']",N/A

1198565,A2FI3Y0KNJWI5N,B001GQXSA6,"R. Wagner ""fritzopup""","[9, 11]","I was really looking forward to seeing it as I had read that this formation of the band included Doug Ingle, Lee Dorman and Ron Bushy, three of the original four who recorded the In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida  LP. However after viewing I was let down. This project appears to be cheaply done beginning with the title menu as it fails to list the song ""Ezy Rider"". The performance looks like it was filmed in a small German club. For some reason there are fades after each song-maybe to distract the viewer from the relatively light audience response (applause) to the songs. The audio mix is rather thin on the bottom end, which I found very disappointing as Lee Dorman is a very melodic bass player. There is good use of multi-camera angles but I found it disconcerting that many times the camera remains focused on band members who are not soloing or singing.The band is rather long in the tooth-seeing Ron Bushy play drums in his ""wife beater"" tee shirt with sagging arms and a beer gut does much to dispel the magic. He does a more than adequate drum solo and Doug Ingle is in excellent voice but for some reason the band doesn't seem much energized and the songs are taken slower than their original counterparts. The concert is rather short at 62 minutes with no encores.The only extra on the disc is 40 minutes of solo interviews but the editing here is atrocious. It jumps from one person to another (sometimes in mid-sentence) and there is no continuity. The first interview begins with Doug Ingle playing a song on an acoustic guitar but the last interview is Doug telling us the story about the song he is about to play (which we previously heard with no explanation.) And what the hell is Steve Howe doing in these interviews anyway?? Lee Dorman spends his interview speaking about the wonders of playing open air festivals in the `60s and then explains why they opted out of playing Woodstock due to the excessive hassle of getting a helicopter to the festival grounds. Ron Bushy talks about wanting to write and record new material and getting the music out to the fans. There are two ""new songs"" included in the selections and if they were indicative of the best that was being written it is no surprise that 12 years later there still is no new Iron Butterfly CD. Wait to get this as a used DVD. I wouldn't mind paying under $10 for it but that is the best recommendation I can give.",2,Long in the tooth and cheaply done,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,2388,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'had', 'read', 'formation', 'band', 'included', 'Doug', 'Ingle', 'Lee', 'Dorman', 'Ron', 'Bushy', 'three', 'original', 'four', 'who', 'recorded', 'In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida', 'LP', 'However', 'viewing', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'project', 'be', 'cheaply', 'done', 'beginning', 'title', 'menu', 'list', 'song', 'Ezy', 'Rider', 'performance', 'was', 'filmed', 'small', 'German', 'club', 'reason', 'are', 'fades', 'song-maybe', 'distract', 'viewer', 'relatively', 'light', 'audience', 'response', 'applause', 'songs', 'audio', 'mix', 'rather', 'thin', 'bottom', 'end', 'found', 'very', 'disappointing', 'Lee', 'Dorman', 'very', 'melodic', 'bass', 'player', 'good', 'use', 'multi-camera', 'angles', 'found', 'disconcerting', 'many', 'times', 'camera', 'focused', 'band', 'members', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'soloing', 'singing.The', 'band', 'rather', 'long', 'tooth-seeing', 'Ron', 'Bushy', 'play', 'drums', 'wife', 'beater', 'tee', 'shirt', 'sagging', 'arms', 'beer', 'gut', 'much', 'dispel', 'magic', 'more', 'adequate', 'drum', 'solo', 'Doug', 'Ingle', 'excellent', 'voice', 'reason', 'band', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'energized', 'songs', 'are', 'taken', 'slower', 'original', 'counterparts', 'concert', 'rather', 'short', '62', 'minutes', 'encores.The', 'only', 'disc', '40', 'minutes', 'solo', 'interviews', 'editing', 'here', 'atrocious', 'one', 'person', 'sometimes', 'mid-sentence', 'continuity', 'first', 'interview', 'Doug', 'Ingle', 'playing', 'song', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'last', 'interview', 'Doug', 'telling', 'story', 'song', 'play', 'previously', 'heard', 'explanation', 'what', 'hell', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'doing', 'interviews', 'anyway', 'Lee', 'Dorman', 'interview', 'speaking', 'wonders', 'playing', 'open', 'air', 'festivals', '60s', 'then', 'why', 'opted', 'playing', 'Woodstock', 'due', 'excessive', 'hassle', 'getting', 'helicopter', 'festival', 'grounds', 'Ron', 'Bushy', 'talks', 'wanting', 'write', 'record', 'new', 'material', 'getting', 'music', 'fans', 'are', 'two', 'new', 'songs', 'included', 'selections', 'were', 'indicative', 'best', 'was', 'being', 'written', 'surprise', '12', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'new', 'Iron', 'Butterfly', 'CD', 'Wait', 'get', 'used', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'paying', '10', 'best', 'recommendation', 'can', 'give']",N/A
