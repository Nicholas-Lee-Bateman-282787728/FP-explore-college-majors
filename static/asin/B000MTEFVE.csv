1050602,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B000MTEFVE,D.P.,"[23, 25]","This was without a doubt a highly underrated comedy series....but unfortunally, it was so underrated & overlooked that after having it change timeslots various times during the two season that the show was eventually cancelled & I highly doubt that there will be a season 2 DVD set so this is all that we're going to get of this show.  This show is about two middle aged adults with teenagers trying to raise them up while dealing with real life situations.  This isn't like the other television shows of this nature as this one takes on the issues dead on using dark comedy & takes on real life issues going on in today's society regarding teenagers & adults not only through real life but also through confessionals (ala ""Real World""), flashbacks, and flash-fowards.  From interracial dating & the race issues involved with it, cyber sex, drugs & alcohol, cosmetic surgery, teenage sex, punishing your kids, the male ego, homosexuality & more.  With Dave & Vicky being middleaged parents with their own adult problems along with their kids in Larry who's parents think he's gay & his best friend/neighbor Kenny who actually is gay with a crush on Larry; Hillary the typical sexy teenage daughter who's more into dating than school; Mike is the youngest who's about video games & hormones whenever he's not trying to hustle/blackmail his dad;...it's just got the formula for a good comedy & this show is just that.  With DVD extras being deleted scenes & confessionals from the cast & crew (right in the same humor as the actual episodes)...I recommend to pick this up as this is probably the last trace of this underrated TV show that you'll see.",5,A Funny Underrated Comedy,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,1648,"['was', 'doubt', 'highly', 'underrated', 'comedy', 'series', '.but', 'unfortunally', 'was', 'so', 'underrated', 'overlooked', 'having', 'change', 'timeslots', 'various', 'times', 'two', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'eventually', 'cancelled', 'highly', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'season', '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'so', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'show', 'show', 'two', 'middle', 'aged', 'adults', 'teenagers', 'trying', 'raise', 'up', 'dealing', 'real', 'life', 'situations', ""n't"", 'other', 'television', 'shows', 'nature', 'one', 'issues', 'dead', 'using', 'dark', 'comedy', 'real', 'life', 'issues', 'going', 'today', 'society', 'regarding', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'not', 'only', 'real', 'life', 'also', 'confessionals', 'Real', 'World', 'flashbacks', 'flash-fowards', 'interracial', 'dating', 'race', 'issues', 'involved', 'cyber', 'sex', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'cosmetic', 'surgery', 'teenage', 'sex', 'punishing', 'kids', 'male', 'ego', 'homosexuality', 'more', 'Dave', 'Vicky', 'being', 'middleaged', 'parents', 'own', 'adult', 'problems', 'kids', 'Larry', 'who', 'parents', 'think', 'gay', 'best', 'friend/neighbor', 'Kenny', 'who', 'actually', 'gay', 'crush', 'Larry', 'Hillary', 'typical', 'sexy', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'more', 'dating', 'school', 'Mike', 'youngest', 'who', 'video', 'games', 'hormones', 'whenever', 'not', 'trying', 'hustle/blackmail', 'dad', 'just', 'got', 'formula', 'good', 'comedy', 'show', 'just', 'DVD', 'extras', 'being', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'confessionals', 'cast', 'crew', 'right', 'same', 'humor', 'actual', 'episodes', 'recommend', 'pick', 'up', 'probably', 'last', 'trace', 'underrated', 'TV', 'show', ""'ll"", 'see']",The War at Home: Season 1
