1622439,A18U9BQQQ0U8F5,B00B62ER0U,Grieger,"[2, 2]","I'll admit it first, as a bit of a disclaimer. We got hooked on Borgen (not Nordic Noir but made by Danmarks Radio which made The Killing) and loved the American version of The Killing. That led us to track down the original Danish version of The Killing, Forbrydelsen, and to broaden our search to find more Nordic Noir. We of course found The Bridge (again, Danish version) and we were hungry for more.Vares was one of the ones we picked up, more because it was &#34;related&#34; and less because we checked reviews and the like. As a result, we've sort of learned that not all Nordic Noir is created equal (it's not that bad).With Vares, we've got the Finnish entry to the Nordic Noir field. Vares is a private eye and the character plays out like a pretty typical one as well: scraping the bottom of the barrel to make ends meet, taking on cases that sometimes start as your typical domestic flavor case only to having him stumble into something bigger.Vares himself hangs out in a pub with friends and is tapped into the various parts of the underworld of the city of Turku. Each episode is effectively a movie (usually running about 1.5 hours) and follows a case or set of cases that are related.You've got all the usual trappings of a cliched private detective novel here. There's a voiceover, the PI is hard on his luck, etc. You start to expect him to call women &#34;dames&#34; next. Still, and maybe this is just a personal thing for me, there's something about watching a procedural set in a city in a different country with a different language and culture permeating all aspects of the drama.  Even so, while we generally enjoyed the episodes, by the last one, we weren't quite as enamored as we were with the DR dramas.Maybe it's just the character isn't really special (he's smart but he's also lucky) or the production values are a bit meager (not terribly but there are times you feel like a better director might have made a much better episode). Something about the series just doesn't pull it above the above average mark. Like I said, if you're desperate for the genre and really like the idea of watching these Scandinavian dramas, you'll likely enjoy it well enough.At the same time, I feel like we've sort of been ruined by the DR dramas. A combination of slick production values, great writing and stories, and most important of all great characters you can connect with really bring those dramas to the fore...and raise bar against which these others can't help but be compared against.So, if you're looking for another The Killing or The Bridge, I'm afraid you won't find it here. But, if you enjoyed Irene Huss, for instance, or you like the rough and tumble PI type, I think you'll find something here to enjoy.By the way, from what I've seen, there are six episodes released (these and another set of three). There's an older series (this is effectively a remake) from 2004 that's different (it's actually a standalone movie if I recall correctly). I think they'd wanted to bring back the actor from the first one but they couldn't so they brought in Antti Reini who does just fine.",3,A bit cliche and rough around the edges but not terrible if you're looking for more Nordic Noir.,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,3113,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'first', 'bit', 'disclaimer', 'got', 'hooked', 'Borgen', 'not', 'Nordic', 'Noir', 'made', 'Danmarks', 'Radio', 'made', 'Killing', 'loved', 'American', 'version', 'Killing', 'led', 'track', 'down', 'original', 'Danish', 'version', 'Killing', 'Forbrydelsen', 'broaden', 'search', 'find', 'more', 'Nordic', 'Noir', 'course', 'found', 'Bridge', 'again', 'Danish', 'version', 'were', 'hungry', 'more.Vares', 'was', 'one', 'ones', 'picked', 'up', 'more', 'was', '34', 'related', '34', 'less', 'checked', 'reviews', 'like', 'result', ""'ve"", 'sort', 'learned', 'not', 'Nordic', 'Noir', 'created', 'equal', 'not', 'bad', '.With', 'Vares', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Finnish', 'entry', 'Nordic', 'Noir', 'field', 'Vares', 'private', 'eye', 'character', 'out', 'pretty', 'typical', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'scraping', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'taking', 'cases', 'sometimes', 'start', 'typical', 'domestic', 'flavor', 'case', 'only', 'having', 'stumble', 'something', 'bigger.Vares', 'out', 'pub', 'friends', 'tapped', 'various', 'parts', 'underworld', 'city', 'Turku', 'episode', 'effectively', 'movie', 'usually', 'running', 'about', '1.5', 'hours', 'case', 'set', 'cases', 'are', 'related.You', ""'ve"", 'got', 'usual', 'trappings', 'cliched', 'private', 'detective', 'novel', 'here', 'voiceover', 'PI', 'hard', 'luck', 'etc', 'start', 'expect', 'call', 'women', '34', 'dames', '34', 'next', 'Still', 'maybe', 'just', 'personal', 'thing', 'something', 'watching', 'procedural', 'set', 'city', 'different', 'country', 'different', 'language', 'culture', 'permeating', 'aspects', 'drama', 'Even', 'so', 'generally', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'last', 'one', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'enamored', 'were', 'DR', 'just', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'special', 'smart', 'also', 'lucky', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'bit', 'meager', 'not', 'terribly', 'are', 'times', 'feel', 'better', 'director', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'episode', 'Something', 'series', 'just', ""n't"", 'pull', 'above', 'average', 'mark', 'said', ""'re"", 'desperate', 'genre', 'really', 'idea', 'watching', 'Scandinavian', 'dramas', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'enjoy', 'well', 'same', 'time', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'sort', 'been', 'ruined', 'DR', 'dramas', 'combination', 'slick', 'production', 'values', 'great', 'writing', 'stories', 'most', 'important', 'great', 'characters', 'can', 'connect', 'really', 'bring', 'dramas', 'fore', 'raise', 'bar', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'compared', 'against.So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Killing', 'Bridge', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'enjoyed', 'Irene', 'Huss', 'instance', 'rough', 'tumble', 'PI', 'type', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'something', 'here', 'enjoy.By', 'way', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'six', 'episodes', 'released', 'set', 'three', 'older', 'series', 'effectively', 'remake', '2004', 'different', 'actually', 'standalone', 'movie', 'recall', 'correctly', 'think', ""'d"", 'wanted', 'bring', 'back', 'actor', 'first', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'so', 'brought', 'Antti', 'Reini', 'who', 'just', 'fine']",Private Eye Vares: Episodes 1-3
