When I saw that the entire series could be had I decided to use it for one of my jet lag series.While I thought the major arc moved a little slowly at first I enjoyed the first season of getting to know the characters.  The second and third seasons I was glued to my set.  Unfortunately, I didn't quite enjoy the 4th season, because it seemed to come out of nowhere.  It felt like a major left turn into a totally new universe and I didn't particularly like most of the inhabitants.  I am grateful they were given a fifth season to wind up several threads that had been dangling since season one.  Given that I had to accept the premises delivered in season 4, season 5 at least redeemed some of them a bit.My issues only target the storyline, one that many may not have.  As far as acting, it was amazing to watch actors explore the tiny differences that could appear should their character or life just been slightly different.  Just the way the moved and held their bodies made it readily apparent as to which version they were.The series came in a box which held the five series in separate season boxes.  Within the cases the disks can be attached to the plastic &#34;pages&#34; by the center, which means there is no sliding and therefore fewer scratches.I have seen several although not all of the special features.  The ones I have seen were enjoyable and quite informative on giving behind the scenes look.All of the disks were good although one episode, the one where the man keeps resetting time so he can spend time with his wife who has Alzheimer's, kept skipping.  At first I thought it was part of the show, I finally had to give up and just read about the episode.So while I may not have &#34;loved&#34; all of the storyline, I did enjoy all of the shows.I recommend this series.",4,Loved the first 3 seasons...,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,1871,"['had', 'heard', 'series', 'was', 'unable', 'watch', 'was', 'When', 'saw', 'entire', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'had', 'decided', 'use', 'one', 'jet', 'lag', 'series.While', 'thought', 'major', 'arc', 'moved', 'little', 'slowly', 'first', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'was', 'glued', 'set', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enjoy', '4th', 'season', 'seemed', 'come', 'nowhere', 'felt', 'major', 'left', 'turn', 'totally', 'new', 'universe', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'most', 'inhabitants', 'am', 'grateful', 'were', 'given', 'fifth', 'season', 'wind', 'up', 'several', 'threads', 'had', 'been', 'dangling', 'season', 'one', 'Given', 'had', 'accept', 'premises', 'delivered', 'season', '4', 'season', '5', 'least', 'redeemed', 'bit.My', 'issues', 'only', 'target', 'storyline', 'one', 'many', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'As', 'far', 'acting', 'was', 'amazing', 'watch', 'actors', 'tiny', 'differences', 'could', 'appear', 'should', 'character', 'life', 'just', 'been', 'slightly', 'different', 'Just', 'way', 'moved', 'held', 'bodies', 'made', 'readily', 'apparent', 'version', 'were.The', 'series', 'came', 'box', 'held', 'five', 'series', 'separate', 'season', 'boxes', 'cases', 'disks', 'can', 'be', 'attached', 'plastic', '34', 'pages', '34', 'center', 'sliding', 'therefore', 'fewer', 'scratches.I', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'not', 'special', 'features', 'ones', 'have', 'seen', 'were', 'enjoyable', 'quite', 'informative', 'giving', 'scenes', 'look.All', 'disks', 'were', 'good', 'one', 'episode', 'one', 'where', 'man', 'resetting', 'time', 'can', 'spend', 'time', 'wife', 'who', 'Alzheimer', 'kept', 'skipping', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'part', 'show', 'finally', 'had', 'give', 'up', 'just', 'read', 'episode.So', 'may', 'not', 'have', '34', 'loved', '34', 'storyline', 'did', 'enjoy', 'shows.I', 'recommend', 'series']",N/A

1553445,A1EXBK6NNHJ4PW,B008HE9PUC,Emma Richards,"[51, 56]","I remember when this show began in 2008. It looked mildly interesting, but with one thing and another, I never got around to watching it, till this summer, when I went over to my sister's apartment. She and her boyfriend had it on DVD, so she asked if I wanted to watch some of it and thought sure, why not. We watched the first episode and I found it incredibly derivative, but she offered to lend me the first season and I didn't want to be rude, so I accepted. Over the course of the week, I watched it, more out of boredom than anything... then something strange happened. About halfway through season one, I found myself looking forward to each episode. I watched the first season in six days. I then borrowed the other seasons from my sister, and watched the rest of the show in ten days. That's right, I watched a five season, 100-episode show in 16 days, a personal record.The first half of the first season was rather slow and a ripoff of many such shows that came before, but after that the show dived into its own mythology and really became its own animal, and an awesome one at that. The mythology is fascinating, and the writers manage to make the alternate universes and different timelines original. The characters, which at the beginning were cardboard cutouts of the mad scientist, the stoic cop/agent and the sarcastic Han Solo type, became beautiful subversions of those types of characters, and the actors, especially Anna Torv as the lead, Olivia, improved drastically over the course of the show, to the point where I was very invested in the characters and their various love stories. Needless to say, my attachment to the characters made season five an emotional roller coaster ride. Seasons three and two were the best, in my opinion, but all the seasons were good (except, as noted, the shaky first half of season one).This show is my new obsession. I'm actually glad I didn't watch it till it had ended because then I got to watch the whole thing in a nearly-uninterrupted, highly-caffeinated nerd marathon. I just received my Associate of Arts degree, so I splurged and got this (and the Collide album ""Chasing the Ghost"") as a little present from myself, to myself. Oh, me, you know me so well!Here's how I rate each season:One: 4/5 starsTwo: 5/5 starsThree: 5/5 stars (my favorite!)Four: 4.5/5 starsFive: 4/5 starsOverall, I give the show 4.5 stars.

1553457,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B008HE9PUC,Mike S.,"[23, 34]","I have the individual seasons on Blu Ray, not the set.  This will just be a review of my impressions of the series not the packaging or the extras that are included with this version.Fringe is definitely not a show that will appeal to everyone.  Even though it started out with fairly good ratings it always was kind of a ""cult"" following kind of show.  The premise was that a special division of the FBI was set up to investigate strange phenomenon (which was referred to in the first couple seasons as the pattern), and that much of the phenomena was based around the work of Dr. Walter Bishop (played by John Noble who gives probably the best overall performance in the series) who had been in a mental hospital for 17 years.  He ends up as a special consultant (along with his son Peter (played by Joshua Jackson) helping investigate the events.I think the cornerstone of the series was the wonderful acting.  All the actors from the series regulars to the recurring to the bit parts did very well.  It was another series where there was really no huge star that was a series regular.  Leonard Nimoy did make a few cameo appearances throughout the series, but he was not in many of the episodes.  I also like how they always grounded the unreal concepts in real science.  They either took a known scientific fact and then stretched it, or took a scientific hypothesis and tried to come up with an explanation for it. Obviously the outcomes were totally fake and unreal, but the premise that it started with was at least rooted in something that was.This part contains some spoilerish material so if you have not seen it yet you may want to skip it....The first season was kind of a serial case-of-the-week formula.  Although you can see they were placing hints from the start of the two big story lines of the series the war against the parallel universe and the war against the observers.  There was actually a lot of continuity between the episodes, and as a result it is definitely one of those series where you really do have to see it from the beginning to get what is going on.The only problem I have with the series is that at times it tried to do too much, and often went on too many tangents.  Personally I think they should have focused on one big story (either the parallel universe war, or the observer takeover) and stuck with that.  The 4th season kept the parallel universe, but changed the story lines because of Peter being ""erased.""  On one hand it allow for a different twist on the stories, but on the other hand it created a story line that just ended in the 4th season finale.  That story of William Bell's attempt to create his own universe did not really get totally resolved (yes they stopped him, but he was allowed to just disappear) before the show did the time jump to tell the story of the observer takeover which ultimately ended the series.  I think they lost a lot of more casual viewers that season because things just got hard to follow.If you are not one who can easily suspend your disbelief this series is not for you.  But if you are into science and entertained by sci-fi material, this is worth giving a look.  It definitely gets weird at times, but that is the point, and often joked about in the show.  If you do like that kind of thing you will enjoy the series.",5,Just a review of the series,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,3310,"['have', 'individual', 'seasons', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'not', 'set', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'review', 'impressions', 'series', 'not', 'packaging', 'extras', 'are', 'included', 'version.Fringe', 'definitely', 'not', 'show', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'Even', 'started', 'out', 'fairly', 'good', 'ratings', 'always', 'was', 'kind', 'cult', 'following', 'kind', 'show', 'premise', 'was', 'special', 'division', 'FBI', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'investigate', 'strange', 'phenomenon', 'was', 'referred', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'pattern', 'much', 'phenomena', 'was', 'based', 'work', 'Dr.', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'played', 'John', 'Noble', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'overall', 'performance', 'series', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'mental', 'hospital', '17', 'years', 'up', 'special', 'consultant', 'son', 'Peter', 'played', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'helping', 'investigate', 'events.I', 'think', 'cornerstone', 'series', 'was', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'actors', 'series', 'recurring', 'bit', 'parts', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'series', 'where', 'was', 'really', 'huge', 'star', 'was', 'series', 'regular', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'did', 'make', 'few', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'many', 'episodes', 'also', 'like', 'how', 'always', 'grounded', 'unreal', 'concepts', 'real', 'science', 'took', 'known', 'scientific', 'fact', 'then', 'stretched', 'took', 'scientific', 'hypothesis', 'tried', 'come', 'up', 'explanation', 'Obviously', 'outcomes', 'were', 'totally', 'fake', 'unreal', 'premise', 'started', 'was', 'least', 'rooted', 'something', 'was.This', 'part', 'spoilerish', 'material', 'so', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'yet', 'may', 'want', 'skip', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'kind', 'serial', 'case-of-the-week', 'formula', 'can', 'see', 'were', 'placing', 'hints', 'start', 'two', 'big', 'story', 'lines', 'series', 'war', 'parallel', 'universe', 'war', 'observers', 'was', 'actually', 'lot', 'continuity', 'episodes', 'result', 'definitely', 'one', 'series', 'where', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'see', 'beginning', 'get', 'what', 'going', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'series', 'times', 'tried', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'often', 'went', 'too', 'many', 'tangents', 'Personally', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'focused', 'one', 'big', 'story', 'parallel', 'universe', 'war', 'observer', 'takeover', 'stuck', '4th', 'season', 'kept', 'parallel', 'universe', 'changed', 'story', 'lines', 'Peter', 'being', 'erased', 'one', 'hand', 'allow', 'different', 'twist', 'stories', 'other', 'hand', 'created', 'story', 'line', 'just', 'ended', '4th', 'season', 'finale', 'story', 'William', 'Bell', 'attempt', 'create', 'own', 'universe', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'get', 'totally', 'resolved', 'yes', 'stopped', 'was', 'allowed', 'just', 'disappear', 'show', 'did', 'time', 'jump', 'tell', 'story', 'observer', 'takeover', 'ultimately', 'ended', 'series', 'think', 'lost', 'lot', 'more', 'casual', 'viewers', 'season', 'things', 'just', 'got', 'hard', 'follow.If', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'easily', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'series', 'not', 'are', 'science', 'entertained', 'sci-fi', 'material', 'worth', 'giving', 'look', 'definitely', 'weird', 'times', 'point', 'often', 'joked', 'show', 'do', 'kind', 'thing', 'will', 'enjoy', 'series']",N/A
1553458,A38K01P0FW7ZL4,B008HE9PUC,Ming Ciao,"[8, 25]","Overall, the series was solid. Not great, but solid with moments of emotional poignance. My main problem with FRINGE is it resets the timeline every so often, essentially nulling all the character development preceding. This is one of the main problems with the series. Otherwise, it's a fresh take to the science-fiction investigative crime element christened in the nineties by THE X-FILES. And while the episodic content may reflect a certain harmony to THE X-FILES, this show isn't anywhere near close to that emotional tone. Even the cinematography reflects that.THE X-FILES used many dark, shadowy hues purposefully to create a film noir atmosphere, and to accent characters' surreptitious demeanors. Not everyone works out their problems, and are best friends at the end of the day like on FRINGE. But FRINGE was clearly going for a lighter, cleaner tone. Overall, FRINGE tastefully executes science-fiction, alternate timelines, and degrees of cyberpunk. All the while maintaining a strong dynamic between Peter, Olivia, Astrid, and Walter.Season 1 lags at first, but picks up steam towards the end. Seasons 2, and 3 are where FRINGE comes into its own.
