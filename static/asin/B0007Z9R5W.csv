At first when they had first announced the original Halloweentown, I thought it would be a lame, cheap movie but I was shocked when I saw it, the special effects, visuals and acting were all excellent, the acting was superb and was very believable, the charectors are well thought out and you really feel like your with them wherever they go whether its in there home or in HalloweenTown. Not only are the visuals, Special Effects, and Acting excellent, but the premise is also very original as well and doesn't feel like a carbon copy of something else. The HalloweenTown movies are one of my favorite Halloween movies of all time. It just gets me into the holiday that will be coming up and I get so excited, it brings me into the spirit! You need to buy these on DVD or at least give it a watch because you will not be dissapointed. This goes for all three though I will say that the third film wasn't as great as the first two, but it was still great and enjoyable and will leave you with a smile on your face. Buy these on DVD and enjoy them every October.The first one has Marny (Kimberly J. Brown), a normal, or so we thought, 13 year old girl who is shunned off from the Halloween holiday from her mom claiming she has reasons for this. But Marny just loves Halloween, like someone in the movie says, Halloween was like made for her. Her younger sister also enjoys the Holiday but isn't in the 'know' of how fun it can be because her mom has done a good job of making sure they don't celebrate it at all (which means no trick or treating, no decorations), the only one in the family who sides with there mom is Marny's brother who is a bit of a goody, smart too-shoes. But when Marnys grandmother comes for a visit, things unfold and soon Marny and her siblings discover that they all have magic, Marny's and her sister are Witches and there young brother is a Warlock, the mom is also a witch but wanted her and her kids to be normal which is why she always shunned out Halloween all together, when Marny sneaks onto a ""ordinary"" bus that her grandma gets on when she leaves there house with her brother (and soon you find out that there younger sister snuck on without them knowing), they are brought to Halloweentown where there grandma lives, its a peaceful, extremely cheerful place full of candy, costumes, bright colors, interesting stores/shops that sell broomsticks ext. But the main interesting aspect...is that monsters live there, not mean, ugly monsters, some are ugly but some are beautiful and human like, they all have nice or mean personalitys and act perfectly normal. Soon after spending a little bit of time there, they discover that the towns people are turning mean and grumpy, evil almost and then dissapearing the next day. Soon they are thrown into a mystery which gets even more complicated when Marnys mother discovers that they have snuck off. It's a real great film to watch and its all excellent and believable, with some great funny humore present.The second film returns all the same charectors from the first with some new ones, good and bad, the plot is somewhat similar to the first but is very different as well, this time, theres a new person trying to turn  humans into monsters at midnight of Halloween, Marny and her grandmother get trapped in Halloweentown where all the residents are turning gloomy and the town is turning gray along with them (literally), soon everyone has to band together to stop the new villain and save Halloweentown as well as the human world. It's also great and very original, it's just as fresh, great for the eye and as funny too, the visual effects are just as good or maybe a bit better and the acting is equally as good. It's great and matches up with the first.So buy these movies (and get the third as well, it'll be worth it) and have a Happy Halloween which is almost here!",5,A Real Halloween Treat,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,3936,"['two', 'third', 'Halloweentown', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'first', 'when', 'had', 'first', 'announced', 'original', 'Halloweentown', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'lame', 'cheap', 'movie', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'saw', 'special', 'effects', 'visuals', 'acting', 'were', 'excellent', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'charectors', 'are', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'really', 'feel', 'wherever', 'go', 'home', 'HalloweenTown', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'visuals', 'Special', 'Effects', 'Acting', 'excellent', 'premise', 'also', 'very', 'original', 'well', ""n't"", 'feel', 'carbon', 'copy', 'something', 'else', 'HalloweenTown', 'movies', 'are', 'one', 'favorite', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'time', 'just', 'holiday', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'up', 'get', 'so', 'excited', 'spirit', 'need', 'buy', 'DVD', 'least', 'give', 'watch', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'three', 'will', 'say', 'third', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'first', 'two', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'enjoyable', 'will', 'leave', 'smile', 'face', 'Buy', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'October.The', 'first', 'one', 'Marny', 'Kimberly', 'J', 'Brown', 'normal', 'so', 'thought', '13', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'shunned', 'off', 'Halloween', 'holiday', 'mom', 'claiming', 'reasons', 'Marny', 'just', 'Halloween', 'someone', 'movie', 'Halloween', 'was', 'made', 'younger', 'sister', 'also', 'Holiday', ""n't"", ""'know"", 'how', 'fun', 'can', 'be', 'mom', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'celebrate', 'trick', 'treating', 'decorations', 'only', 'one', 'family', 'who', 'sides', 'mom', 'Marny', 'brother', 'who', 'bit', 'goody', 'smart', 'too-shoes', 'when', 'Marnys', 'grandmother', 'visit', 'things', 'unfold', 'soon', 'Marny', 'siblings', 'discover', 'have', 'magic', 'Marny', 'sister', 'are', 'Witches', 'there', 'young', 'brother', 'Warlock', 'mom', 'also', 'witch', 'wanted', 'kids', 'be', 'normal', 'why', 'always', 'shunned', 'out', 'Halloween', 'together', 'when', 'Marny', 'ordinary', 'bus', 'grandma', 'when', 'there', 'house', 'brother', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'there', 'younger', 'sister', 'snuck', 'knowing', 'are', 'brought', 'Halloweentown', 'where', 'grandma', 'lives', 'peaceful', 'extremely', 'cheerful', 'place', 'full', 'candy', 'costumes', 'bright', 'colors', 'interesting', 'stores/shops', 'sell', 'broomsticks', 'ext', 'main', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'monsters', 'live', 'there', 'not', 'mean', 'ugly', 'monsters', 'are', 'ugly', 'are', 'beautiful', 'human', 'have', 'nice', 'mean', 'personalitys', 'act', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'Soon', 'spending', 'little', 'bit', 'time', 'discover', 'towns', 'people', 'are', 'turning', 'mean', 'grumpy', 'almost', 'then', 'dissapearing', 'next', 'day', 'Soon', 'are', 'thrown', 'mystery', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'Marnys', 'mother', 'discovers', 'have', 'snuck', 'off', 'real', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'excellent', 'believable', 'great', 'funny', 'humore', 'present.The', 'second', 'film', 'returns', 'same', 'charectors', 'first', 'new', 'ones', 'good', 'bad', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'first', 'very', 'different', 'well', 'time', 'new', 'person', 'trying', 'turn', 'humans', 'monsters', 'midnight', 'Halloween', 'Marny', 'grandmother', 'get', 'trapped', 'Halloweentown', 'where', 'residents', 'are', 'turning', 'gloomy', 'town', 'turning', 'gray', 'literally', 'soon', 'everyone', 'band', 'together', 'stop', 'new', 'villain', 'save', 'Halloweentown', 'as', 'well', 'human', 'world', 'also', 'great', 'very', 'original', 'just', 'fresh', 'great', 'eye', 'funny', 'too', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'maybe', 'bit', 'better', 'acting', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'great', 'up', 'first.So', 'buy', 'movies', 'get', 'third', 'as', 'well', ""'ll"", 'be', 'have', 'Happy', 'Halloween', 'almost', 'here']",N/A

They have been some of Disney Channel's most popular programs. I don't know about you but Ive had them recorded on VHS for years, but now they are available officially from Disney on DVD! Halloweentown, Disney Channel's 4th Original Movie, premiered on Disney Channel Friday, October 17, 1998, and has aired almost every Halloween since. The story is very amazing. This is the story of Marnie Piper (Kimberly J. Brown, ""Quints"", ""Bringing down the House"") and her family. On her 13th Halloween, Marnie's grandmother Agatha Cromwell (Debbie Reynolds) visits and accidently lets a family secret slip to Marnie. Marnie has always wondered why her mother has sheltered her and her siblings, Dylan and Sophie (Soapy :lol:) and now she finally learns the truth. She overhears her mother and grandmother arguing about Marnie's future. Her grandmother wants to bring her back to her home town, and begin her training as a Witch! After her mother forbiding it, Marnie sneaks out of the house with her brother to follow her grandmother. She follows her to her home, Halloweentown, where she discovers a whole new world, complete with Evil Warlocks, and mysterious creatures. This movie, widely thought to be the best of the trilogy is sure to entertain children of all ages. Even the parents will enjoy this family flick. Mine does!Halloweentown II:Kalabar's Revenge: Halloweentown II, Disney Channel's 33rd Original Movie, originally premiered on October 12, 2001 and continues where the first left off. Marnie is now in training with her grandmother, when on Halloween night they go for their annual visit to their lovely home. But when an evil Warlock, named Kalabar threatens the lives of not only Hallooweentown but also Earth, Marnie must team up with some old friends to save everyone, AGAIN!!The DVD: I am a little disappointed that Disney has decided to put the first two movies in this series onto one DVD, becuase it will lessen chance of bonus features, it will lessen video and audio quality, and most importantly, It won't look right on my shelves!

There are actually three of these movies now as the third, ""Halloweentown High"" came out in 2004 and it's too bad that Disney didn't release all three together.The basic premise is that there is an alternate world from our own where it is always Halloween called, of course, Halloweentown.  Aggie Cromwell (the radiant Debbie Reynolds) is a powerful witch as is her daughter Gwen (Judith Hoag).  Aggie wants to train Gwen's daughter Marnie (Kimberly Brown) to use her powers before she loses them when she turns 13.  This results in a big argument between Aggy and Gwen.  Aggy returns to Halloweentown but Marnie and her two siblings Dylan and Sophie secretly follow her.  Once there they learn about a dark force threatening Halloween town and only the combined power of all the Cromwell women, including Mom Gwen can stop it.In the sequel, virtually the entire Main cast returns as Marnie has now become more proficient with her powers and as we learned at the end of the first film it turns out that the younger siblings also have developing powers of their own.  This time their old foe Kalabar is back to wreak havoc and try to turn the people of our normal world into monsters.The special effects and makeup in these films are above average, especially for made-for-tv films.  All of the denizens of Halloween town are monsters of some sort and could be a tad scary for little ones but probably not too much.  Kimberly Brown really develops as an actress and holds her own with the veteran Debbie Reynolds.  Judith Hoag gets to do a bit more in this sequel as well.All in all these are pretty good films, good family fun.",4,GREAT HALLOWEEN MOVIES FOR THE FAMILY,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,1764,"['love', 'good', 'family', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'Something', 'not', 'too', 'scary', 'little', 'ones', 'still', 'something', 'absorbing', 'enough', 'adults', 'are', 'actually', 'three', 'movies', 'now', 'third', 'Halloweentown', 'High', 'came', 'out', '2004', 'too', 'bad', 'Disney', 'did', ""n't"", 'release', 'three', 'together.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'alternate', 'world', 'own', 'where', 'always', 'Halloween', 'called', 'course', 'Halloweentown', 'Aggie', 'Cromwell', 'radiant', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'powerful', 'witch', 'daughter', 'Gwen', 'Judith', 'Hoag', 'train', 'Gwen', 'daughter', 'Marnie', 'Kimberly', 'Brown', 'use', 'powers', 'when', '13', 'results', 'big', 'argument', 'Aggy', 'Gwen', 'Aggy', 'Halloweentown', 'Marnie', 'two', 'siblings', 'Dylan', 'Sophie', 'secretly', 'follow', 'Once', 'learn', 'dark', 'force', 'threatening', 'Halloween', 'town', 'only', 'combined', 'power', 'Cromwell', 'women', 'including', 'Mom', 'Gwen', 'can', 'stop', 'it.In', 'sequel', 'virtually', 'entire', 'Main', 'cast', 'returns', 'Marnie', 'now', 'become', 'more', 'proficient', 'powers', 'learned', 'end', 'first', 'film', 'out', 'younger', 'siblings', 'also', 'have', 'developing', 'powers', 'own', 'time', 'old', 'foe', 'Kalabar', 'back', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'try', 'turn', 'people', 'normal', 'world', 'monsters.The', 'special', 'effects', 'makeup', 'films', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'especially', 'made-for-tv', 'films', 'denizens', 'Halloween', 'town', 'are', 'monsters', 'sort', 'could', 'be', 'tad', 'scary', 'little', 'ones', 'probably', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'Kimberly', 'Brown', 'really', 'actress', 'own', 'veteran', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Judith', 'Hoag', 'do', 'bit', 'more', 'sequel', 'well.All', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'films', 'good', 'family', 'fun']",N/A

These two films kept all the major actors from the first film which helps give the series a bit of continuity.In HALLOWEENTOWN, Marnie Cromwell (Kimberly J. Brown) is a thirteen-year-old girl who is slightly obsessed with what her friends call, ""weird stuff"", basically the occult:  witches, vampires, werewolves, ancient writings, strange symbols, etc.  Her mother, Gwen (Judith Hoag), doesn't approve of Marnie's pastime activities and also doesn't allow any of her children, Marnie, Dylan (Joey Zimmerman), and Sophie (Emily Roeske) to attend Halloween parties or go trick or treating.  Dylan thinks it has something to do with the fact that their mother and late father met each other at Halloween and that the holiday has become sensitive for their mother.  However, every year Gwen's mother, Aggie (Debbie Reynolds) stops by Gwen's home and brings gifts, candy, and costumes for the children.  On her 13th Halloween, Marnie overhears her mother and grandmother discusses that their family is an old and famous witch family (the Cromwells) and that if Marnie doesn't begin practicing and studying before the end of the year, she will loose her powers.  Marnie and her siblings follow Aggie back to her home in Halloweentown (a much more colorful place than the town of the same name in A NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS) and help her in defeating a mysterious ""dark thing"" that is trying to rule Halloweentown and destroy humans.HALLOWEENTOWN II:  KALABAR'S REVENGE begins two years after HALLOWEENTOWN ended.  Marnie has been practicing her magic under the tutelage of her mother and grandmother for almost two years.  Once again it's Halloween, but this time the Cromwell home is alive and grooving with a neighborhood Halloween party.  A new neighbor named Kal (Daniel Kountz) shows up and invites Marnie to the high school Halloween dance later that night.  Marnie is smitten with Kal and shows him her grandmother's room.  While passing out treats, Aggie's never-ending bag is suddenly empty and Aggie takes Marnie back with her to Halloweentown to find out exactly what is going wrong.  It turns out the entire town has turned grey and the creatures there are now all dull, boring, and grey humans.  The plot thickens and it's up to the powerful Cromwell clan to figure out just how to undo the black magic and set things right.Neither HALLOWEEN TOWN nor HALLOWEENTOWN II are really that great of movies.  However, they're not really terrible either.  They are Disney Channel films so they are rather family friendly and tame.  Most of the creatures are humorous instead of frightening and the entire Halloweentown world is sort-of tongue-in-cheek.  Kids will probably adore these movies and though there aren't a lot of allusions or references for adults, the acting is decent and the lovely Debbie Reynolds as Aggie Cromwell is fun to watch.  These films are a good way to get children excited about Halloween and maintain their interest after the two-month commercial build-up for the holiday.",3,Some Fun and Friendly Halloween Movies from the Disney Channel,1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,3130,"['DVD', 'two-for', 'package', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'Halloween', 'Town', 'series', 'aired', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'two', 'films', 'kept', 'major', 'actors', 'first', 'film', 'give', 'series', 'bit', 'continuity.In', 'HALLOWEENTOWN', 'Marnie', 'Cromwell', 'Kimberly', 'J', 'Brown', 'thirteen-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'slightly', 'obsessed', 'what', 'friends', 'call', 'weird', 'stuff', 'basically', 'occult', 'witches', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'ancient', 'writings', 'strange', 'symbols', 'etc', 'mother', 'Gwen', 'Judith', 'Hoag', ""n't"", 'approve', 'Marnie', 'pastime', 'activities', 'also', ""n't"", 'allow', 'children', 'Marnie', 'Dylan', 'Joey', 'Zimmerman', 'Sophie', 'Emily', 'Roeske', 'attend', 'Halloween', 'parties', 'go', 'trick', 'treating', 'Dylan', 'something', 'do', 'fact', 'mother', 'late', 'father', 'met', 'other', 'Halloween', 'holiday', 'become', 'sensitive', 'mother', 'However', 'year', 'Gwen', 'mother', 'Aggie', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Gwen', 'home', 'gifts', 'candy', 'costumes', 'children', '13th', 'Halloween', 'Marnie', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'discusses', 'family', 'old', 'famous', 'witch', 'family', 'Cromwells', 'Marnie', ""n't"", 'begin', 'practicing', 'studying', 'end', 'year', 'will', 'loose', 'powers', 'Marnie', 'siblings', 'follow', 'Aggie', 'back', 'home', 'Halloweentown', 'much', 'more', 'colorful', 'place', 'town', 'same', 'name', 'A', 'NIGHTMARE', 'BEFORE', 'CHRISTMAS', 'help', 'defeating', 'mysterious', 'dark', 'thing', 'trying', 'rule', 'Halloweentown', 'destroy', 'humans.HALLOWEENTOWN', 'II', 'KALABAR', 'REVENGE', 'two', 'years', 'HALLOWEENTOWN', 'ended', 'Marnie', 'been', 'practicing', 'magic', 'tutelage', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'almost', 'two', 'years', 'Once', 'again', 'Halloween', 'time', 'Cromwell', 'home', 'alive', 'grooving', 'neighborhood', 'Halloween', 'party', 'new', 'neighbor', 'named', 'Kal', 'Daniel', 'Kountz', 'up', 'Marnie', 'high', 'school', 'Halloween', 'dance', 'later', 'night', 'Marnie', 'smitten', 'Kal', 'grandmother', 'room', 'passing', 'out', 'treats', 'Aggie', 'never-ending', 'bag', 'suddenly', 'empty', 'Aggie', 'Marnie', 'back', 'Halloweentown', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'wrong', 'out', 'entire', 'town', 'turned', 'grey', 'creatures', 'are', 'now', 'dull', 'boring', 'grey', 'humans', 'plot', 'thickens', 'up', 'powerful', 'Cromwell', 'clan', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'undo', 'black', 'magic', 'set', 'things', 'right.Neither', 'HALLOWEEN', 'TOWN', 'HALLOWEENTOWN', 'II', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'movies', 'However', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'terrible', 'are', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'films', 'are', 'rather', 'family', 'friendly', 'tame', 'Most', 'creatures', 'are', 'humorous', 'instead', 'frightening', 'entire', 'Halloweentown', 'world', 'sort-of', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'Kids', 'will', 'probably', 'adore', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'allusions', 'references', 'adults', 'acting', 'decent', 'lovely', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Aggie', 'Cromwell', 'fun', 'watch', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'way', 'get', 'children', 'excited', 'Halloween', 'maintain', 'interest', 'two-month', 'commercial', 'build-up', 'holiday']",N/A

In the second installment, Kalabar's son returns to seek vengeance and his target is Marnie, her family, and the rest of the citizens of Halloweentown.Halloweentown's running time is approx. 84 minutes (color) and Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge runs approx. 81 minutes (in color). There is no subtitle option on both movies. This is family friendly viewing but due to some scary images of supernatural creatures, I would recommend the viewing age be at least 7 and up.",5,"Two fun Halloween movies, perfect for family viewing",1380240000,"09 27, 2013",2013,1793,"['daughter', 'who', 'almost', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'Halloweentown', 'movies', 'DVD', 'set', 'watched', 'films', 'last', 'year', 'checked', 'out', 'DVDs', 'library', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'would', 'get', 'home', 'DVD', 'collection', 'double', 'feature', 'value', 'money', 'price', 'retailing', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Halloweentown', 'Halloweentown', 'II', 'Kalabar', 'Revenge.The', 'set', 'only', 'one', 'disc', 'movies', 'bonus', 'features', 'titled', 'Magic', 'Halloweentown', 'Movies', 'scenes', 'peek', 'Halloweentown', 'Halloweentown', 'II', 'Kalabar', 'Revenge', 'Halloweentown', 'High', 'Twitches', 'where', 'Tia', 'Tamera', 'Mowry', 'Sister', 'Sister', 'chat', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Original', 'Movie', 'Twitches', '.The', 'story', 'centers', 'young', 'girl', 'Marnie', 'Kimberley', 'J', 'Brown', 'who', '13th', 'birthday', 'discovers', 'descended', 'line', 'witches', 'including', 'eccentric', 'grandmother', 'Aggie', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Grrandma', 'secret', 'portal', 'Halloweentown', 'place', 'where', 'ghosts', 'ghouls', 'witches', 'werewolves', 'other', 'supernatural', 'creatures', 'live', 'world', 'set', 'apart', 'world', 'humans', 'long', 'Marnie', 'grandmother', 'as', 'well', 'group', 'friends', 'find', 'battling', 'powers', 'darkness', 'led', 'evil', 'warlock', 'named', 'Kalabar', 'second', 'installment', 'Kalabar', 'son', 'returns', 'seek', 'vengeance', 'target', 'Marnie', 'family', 'rest', 'citizens', 'Halloweentown.Halloweentown', 'running', 'time', 'approx', '84', 'minutes', 'color', 'Halloweentown', 'II', 'Kalabar', 'Revenge', 'approx', '81', 'minutes', 'color', 'subtitle', 'option', 'movies', 'family', 'friendly', 'viewing', 'due', 'scary', 'images', 'supernatural', 'creatures', 'would', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'age', 'be', 'least', '7', 'up']",N/A
