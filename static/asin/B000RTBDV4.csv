1083991,A14M90U445ADWC,B000RTBDV4,"A. Arthur ""Al the webmaster""","[0, 0]","Life gets messy for Bill and his 3 wives in the second season. There is a lot of drama and betrayal involving the shady and colorful extended family members from the Juniper Creek Compound. It seems that a lot of TV series tend to up the ante each season to higher levels of chaos and mayhem, so Big Love is no exception. So, whereas the first season was reminiscent of Ozzie and Harriett, the second season seems more like the Hatfields and the McCoys. The writing and acting are consistently superb, and the all star cast  is pure joy to watch.The show takes place in the present time, but there are a lot of unusual musical oldies popping up that produce a weird sense of timelessness and a connection to the past.  One  word of warning If you're binge watching and you're prone to earworms. The theme song  &#34;God Only Knows&#34; by the Beach Boys is a very catchy tune and after 2 seasons the song is playing in my head constantly.",5,Family Problems,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,938,"['Life', 'messy', 'Bill', '3', 'wives', 'second', 'season', 'lot', 'drama', 'betrayal', 'involving', 'shady', 'colorful', 'extended', 'family', 'members', 'Juniper', 'Creek', 'Compound', 'lot', 'TV', 'series', 'tend', 'up', 'ante', 'season', 'higher', 'levels', 'chaos', 'mayhem', 'so', 'Big', 'Love', 'exception', 'So', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'Ozzie', 'Harriett', 'second', 'season', 'more', 'Hatfields', 'McCoys', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'consistently', 'superb', 'star', 'cast', 'pure', 'joy', 'watch.The', 'show', 'place', 'present', 'time', 'are', 'lot', 'unusual', 'musical', 'oldies', 'popping', 'up', 'produce', 'weird', 'sense', 'timelessness', 'connection', 'past', 'One', 'word', 'warning', ""'re"", 'binge', 'watching', ""'re"", 'prone', 'earworms', 'theme', 'song', '34', 'God', 'Only', 'Knows', '34', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'very', 'catchy', 'tune', '2', 'seasons', 'song', 'playing', 'head', 'constantly']",Big Love: Season 2

Superb writing, even better acting, compelling, jarring, shocking and filled with moments of pure tenderness that just grab you by the heartstrings and lull you in. In this season, episode 6 is my favorite. Bill is dating Ana and Margene has become friends with Ana. Around the 18-minute mark of episode 6 Margene goes to Ana's apartment and the two converse about love and Margene comes clean, telling Ana that she is a polygamist.This one scene is SO captivating, so perfectly executed, so brilliant in its subtlety that it literally takes my breath away every time that I watch it. When Margene tells Ana about her &#34;status,&#34; Ana has a look of shock and says: &#34;No.&#34; Margene takes a second or two to answer and when she does, quietly saying: &#34;Yes,&#34; it is Ginnifer Goodwin showing her talents as an actress as being at the top of their game. It is pure brilliance!The entire season - like the entire series - is just complete perfection.

Sarah is against the principle, and joins a support group for ex-Mormons. Ben decides to embrace the principle whole-heartedly, and begins dating homely identical twins who wish to marry a 'righteous man' such as he. Barb, Nicki and Margene all get more screen time this season, with Bill figuring in when there's a business deal or something is amuck at the compound.The climax of the season is when Roman is shot by a rival polygamist family (the Greens) and Bill very nearly gets voted to be prophet-in-waiting until Roman dies. Instead, the unstable and dangerous Alby begins taking over well before his father is ready to go. The relationship between sibling-rivals Alby and Nicki is fascinating, one which I hope the writers develop further next season.There is no let-down in Season 2. The acting, writing and pacing have a cinematic quality to them, not unlike other HBO series.

1084010,A3715AT2EUT0AL,B000RTBDV4,Michael Clayville,"[0, 1]","OK, so there is the gig.  This show is all about apostate Mormons who leave the LDS church to follow some fictional polygamist group.  Actually, two of the cast were raised in ""the compound"" of said poly group, one was raised LDS and the other ... we have not really learned where she came from, but not from anything related to LDS.  The show loves to portray a really negative light on the LDS church which goes beyond the normal bias polygamists have against LDS folk.  The show likes to poke fun at religion in general and really can be quite sacrilegious at times.They love to drop ""LDS-Speak"" on the viewers, who if not LDS would not get the references at all.  Are they targeting LDS people as watchers of this show??  The LDS church as come out quite critically of the crude nature of the content of this production.  So I am guessing few LDS watch.  Seems the writers could have greatly benefited by having an actual Mormon help as a technical consultant.  My best guess is that they used an ex-Mormon who never really understood their beliefs in the first place.Big Love is full of gratuitous sex ... which is likely to be a BIG PART of what people are curious about, regarding polygamist families.  I imagine many are still looking for all 4 of them in bed together.  That would have ended all credibility in an already somewhat incredulous show.  Thanks producers ... for sparing us that, at least.Now ... with all of that negativity out of the way ... BIG LOVE is honestly fascinating when it comes to viewing the interpersonal relationships between the members of this family, both husband and wives, wives and wives, wives and the various kids, and relationships with outsiders and friends.  What a complicated world these folks (in real life poly families) must live.I could not do it.  One wife is easily enough work for this guy.Special kudos go out to Chloe Sevigny for her role as Nickie...the deeply indoctrinated daughter of the polygamist sect leader, and 2nd wife in the plural marriage of the Big Love family.

1084013,A2M6YQ9IXI0TIO,B000RTBDV4,"Risa Brannon ""bird girl""","[0, 1]","I was a huge fan of Season 1 - Loved the characters, the premise, thought it was very well written, and well acted as well.  It was fascinating to examine all of the issues that arise out of a polygamous marriage - the relationships among the three &#34;sister wives&#34; and their relationship with a husband who truly seems to be in love with and committed to them. To grapple with that seeming contradiction is not just entertaining, but thought-provoking.  To me, the heart and soul of the show is that dynamic.My problem with Season 2 is that it seems to have gotten a bit unfocused.  Too many little plot lines branching out away from the main story.  There is a lot of - what I consider, anyway - gratuitous sexual content that could easily be alluded to without such graphic depictions.  There is a lot of social commentary about life on the &#34;compound&#34; which is ruled by a cruel and demented &#34;prophet&#34; who sanctions women - sometimes very young girls - being &#34;given&#34; to much older men.  There is a lot more attention given to the very unsavory characters of the prophet's son, Alby, and the parents of the main character, Bill.  These characters appear two-dimensional.  And I fear there may be some stereotyping going on here.  And my biggest problem with Season 2 is that Bill, who is at the heart of the story, seems to be completely driven by his vendetta against Roman Grant (the &#34;prophet&#34; and his second wife's father.)  He takes terrible chances with the safety of his family, to say nothing of their emotional well-being.  He appears to be becoming as ruthless as his father-in-law.  He is making his daughter, almost an adult herself, miserable.  If I'm going to be spending so much time with these characters, I really want to like them!  Yes, every hero must fall - but not irredeemably.Is it still engaging?  Yes, of course.  But not as compelling as it was in Season 1.  I'm hoping Season 3 is better.

In the second season of this unique series, things get even more complicated and difficult for polygamist husband Bill Henrikson and his three wives, Barb, Nikki, and Margene.  Their oldest son is tempted carnally and then turns to the polygamy principle for sustenance, the oldest girl goes the opposite direction, Bill considers a fourth wife, Margene wants to be a surrogate mother, Nikki's family makes things dangerous for the Henriksons, one of Roman's intended young brides blackmails some of the Henriksons, and Bill wants to expand his financial empire to include video game slot machines.What's most fascinating about this series  is that the family is portrayed as struggling to live in the modern suburbs, outside of the compounds that most polygamists these days might live in; and that they have tried to hide their lifestyle from many people.  However, one can only hide such a thing for so long.  Imagine how it would be having four partners in a marriage, seven kids among you, and three neighboring houses to coordinate, as well as a high-profile home improvement business.The cast is spot-on, especially the temperamental and conflicted second wife, played by Chloe Sevigny; and the stalwart Harry Dean Stanton as her father, the powerful patriarch who believes himself to be a prophet.",5,Things heat up for the big lovin' family,1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,1317,"['SPOILERS', 'second', 'season', 'unique', 'series', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'difficult', 'polygamist', 'husband', 'Bill', 'Henrikson', 'three', 'wives', 'Barb', 'Nikki', 'Margene', 'oldest', 'son', 'tempted', 'carnally', 'then', 'polygamy', 'principle', 'sustenance', 'oldest', 'girl', 'opposite', 'direction', 'Bill', 'fourth', 'wife', 'Margene', 'be', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'Nikki', 'family', 'things', 'dangerous', 'Henriksons', 'one', 'Roman', 'intended', 'young', 'brides', 'Henriksons', 'Bill', 'expand', 'financial', 'empire', 'include', 'video', 'game', 'slot', 'machines.What', 'most', 'fascinating', 'series', 'family', 'portrayed', 'struggling', 'live', 'modern', 'suburbs', 'compounds', 'most', 'polygamists', 'days', 'might', 'live', 'have', 'tried', 'hide', 'lifestyle', 'many', 'people', 'However', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hide', 'thing', 'so', 'long', 'Imagine', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'having', 'four', 'partners', 'marriage', 'seven', 'kids', 'three', 'neighboring', 'houses', 'coordinate', 'as', 'well', 'high-profile', 'home', 'improvement', 'business.The', 'cast', 'spot-on', 'especially', 'temperamental', 'conflicted', 'second', 'wife', 'played', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'stalwart', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'father', 'powerful', 'patriarch', 'who', 'be', 'prophet']",Big Love: Season 2
