486504,ANXWMD4TRTPXF,6306010939,Amanda M. Rogers,"[5, 8]","Jennifer Connelly and Billy Crudup are great actors. Both understand the power of subtlety and transforming a moment into something more, not just with words but with eyes, and intensity.This movie does disservice to all of their skills but then again because of just how good they are both rise about the material.The editing is choppy and sometimes Keith Gordon, the director, seems to lose focus of what kind of film he is making tonally, that is.  When he allows the leads to sit there and talk on the train after a disastrous outing the magic these actors possess becomes tangible, just absolutely great.This is a grown up romance that is portrayed and certainly more political and feiry than most, but it leaves a lot of questions to answered by the audience and that's rare.The extras on this thing are awesome.  The movie is worth watching but the extras really do great things for this movie. The deleted scenes are actually deleted story lines so if you watch this movie then quickly go to these scenes you get a whole new movie.  There is a directors commentary that is actually informative not only as to the making of the movie but also the actors themselves. Most of the scenes, the really good ones, it turns out, are improvised. Good stuff. Good stuff.Check this movie out and add it to your collection. If you love Jennifer Connelly this is your movie. If you love Billy Crudup this is your movie. If you love romance this is your movie. If you think the title means that this is a scary movie than, well you haven't been following along and this is indeed not your movie.",3,"Waking, indeed.",1057708800,"07 9, 2003",2003,1589,"['Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'understand', 'power', 'subtlety', 'transforming', 'moment', 'something', 'more', 'not', 'just', 'words', 'eyes', 'intensity.This', 'movie', 'disservice', 'skills', 'then', 'again', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'are', 'rise', 'material.The', 'editing', 'choppy', 'sometimes', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'director', 'lose', 'focus', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'making', 'tonally', 'When', 'leads', 'sit', 'there', 'talk', 'train', 'disastrous', 'outing', 'magic', 'actors', 'possess', 'becomes', 'tangible', 'just', 'absolutely', 'great.This', 'grown', 'up', 'romance', 'portrayed', 'certainly', 'more', 'political', 'feiry', 'most', 'lot', 'questions', 'answered', 'audience', 'rare.The', 'extras', 'thing', 'are', 'awesome', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'extras', 'really', 'do', 'great', 'things', 'movie', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'deleted', 'story', 'lines', 'so', 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'quickly', 'go', 'scenes', 'get', 'whole', 'new', 'movie', 'directors', 'commentary', 'actually', 'informative', 'not', 'only', 'making', 'movie', 'also', 'actors', 'Most', 'scenes', 'really', 'good', 'ones', 'out', 'are', 'improvised', 'Good', 'stuff', 'Good', 'stuff.Check', 'movie', 'add', 'collection', 'love', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'movie', 'love', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'movie', 'love', 'romance', 'movie', 'think', 'title', 'scary', 'movie', 'well', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'following', 'along', 'indeed', 'not', 'movie']",Waking the Dead VHS

With the case of Waking The Dead, starring Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly, is a fine example of acting with brilliance. After listening and watching the director's commentary by Keith Gordon, you learn that many scenes were actually improvised by the two actors. The editing style is quite similar to Soderbergh's Out of Sight and The Limey; with its documentary feel of jump cuts and audio lead-ins. Finally, the cinematography is what helps the film's very eery, ghostly world. The DVD has great features: a dozen of outtakes, a different soundtrack on different menus--since the OST never was released on the market, and as aforementioned, a great commentary by the director.

486510,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6306010939,Bobby Underwood,"[18, 22]","Jodie Foster was the executive producer on this haunting film about a real love between two people which may even be strong enough to transend death. Jennifer Connelly could easily have garnered an Oscar here if anyone had noticed. This is a real film about real people, filled with quiet passion and heartbreak. The questions it poses are not easily answered. Can we ever forget real love and move on? Are those we loved still with us somehow after death?Jennifer Connelley is Sarah Williams, a young and bright girl with a heart too full of love and compassion to let injustice rule the world. She is trying to make a difference through her church's efforts in Chile to smuggle out refugees when a bomb explodes, changing the life of her lover Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) forever.What follows are shifts in time as we see the young John Kennedy-like Fielding find true love with this wonderful girl who doesn't seem to fit in with his political aspirations. It is a real and tender love explored more fully by director Keith Gordon than we often see today in films. Sarah becomes the cricket on his shoulder, his conscience for all that is good.But years later he still can not move on from that moment when his life ended. It is as though his soul was killed in the blast as well. Fielding is about to become a congressman while at the same time unsure if he is losing his sanity. A snowy night turns dark and he feels Sarah in the snow surrounding him. He begins to see her watching him. Is it possible she is still alive? Or is love reaching across the threshold of death.We may not have any conclusive answers when this film is over as we are left haunted as well, which was the point. Crudup is terrific as a phone call brings him to the brink of a mental breakdown and Connelly gives a haunting performance as the love that saves him once more. How she does so is left up to us. This is a somber and beautiful meditation on love and how lucky we are to ever find it.The shifts in time are mesmerizing in this richly romantic and hauntingly beautiful film you must see.

The fact that this film shows us the nooks and crannies of the their relationship makes its impact that much deeper.  (Where most films fake a relationship through a series of skits set to a pop song, a la ""Big Fat Greek Wedding"" or ANY Tom Hanks or Julia Roberts Movie, this film actually allows its leads to have conversations - GREAT WRITING.)

Mea culpa. Mea extrema culpa.So WAKING THE DEAD hurted the sensibility of the rare persons who saw it because they couldn't classify this movie in a special genre. The main critique read about  WAKING THE DEAD was that, at the end of the movie, one doesn't know whether this love story has really happened or whether it has only been a dream of the guilty mind of Billy Crudup. Frankly, I don't care at all. WAKING THE DEAD is not a documentary, it's a movie about the power of love, a power which doesn't die with the death of one of the lovers. The rest is literature.The eerie and melancholic atmosphere of WAKING THE DEAD is delicately rendered by Keith Gordon, without artificial special effects, the director using masterfully the simple language of cinema like flashbacks and a smart editing to make us feel the intensity of this love story. By the way, Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly deserve our utmost admiration for their always accurate interpretation.Exceptional bonus features with 45 minutes of deleted scenes, a commentary and a featurette.

Jennifer Connelly brilliantly portrays the young radical Leftist, Sarah Williams, who has nothing but contempt for the United States.  She meets her soul mate Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) and proceeds to guilt trip him into also sharing her political beliefs.  How anti-American is Sarah?  In one scene she tells Fielding that she hopes he does not go to Vietnam because she supports the North Vietnamese Communists!  Sarah perceives America as the beginning and end of most evil in the world. Fielding is ironically committed to becoming the President of the United States.  There is much friction between the two lovers because Fielding sees the importance of compromise.  Sarah, however, will settle for nothing less than absolutist ideological purity.""Waking the Dead"" flash backs from the early 1980s to the early 1970s.  The lovers meet and eventually Sarah gets involved with a very Left wing religious group who is bringing into the country a couple escaping from Chile.  All three are supposedly murdered in a car bomb explosion.  But is Sarah really dead?  Were theauthorities truly able to identify her body after the blast?  Fielding is not sure whether he is losing his mind.  He is running for the U.S. Congress and constantly imagines hearing Sarah's voice and seeing her on the street.  Fielding is involved with Juliet (Molly Parker) who is the niece of his political mentor, Issac.  Juliet is sexually available and she might make an appropriate wife for an aspiring politician.  But will she be able to compete against the memory of the missing Sarah? The story line becomes very convoluted at this point.  One's patience is severely tested for the rest of the film.Should anyone make a point to see ""Waking the Dead?""  The answer is in the affirmative if you wish to observe Jennifer Connelly at her best.  She is truly a remarkable actress and it is easy to understand why Connelly was later picked to star in the very recent ""A Beautiful Mind.""

486516,AVCRD98TH48RN,6306010939,D. Knouse,"[7, 9]","Both Jennifer Connely and Billy Crudup shine in this heart-wrenching film about lost love.  I was particularly moved by Billy Crudup's amazing performance.  It was filled with anger and confusion, longing and despair, but ultimately hope.  His acting here is as good as any actor could possibly attempt; some of his scenes are so intense that they seem out of place with the rest of the movie, and only Jennifer Connelly ever keeps up with him.  The remaining scenes show him numb with the loss of his true love.  His performance is truly remarkable.  There is also a ""sex"" scene between Jennifer and Billy that was pulled off so convincingly that it looked as though they actually were making love.  The intensity they both bring to that scene is genuinely amazing.  There is also another montage of scenes that takes place late in the film with the Peter Gabriel song ""Mercy Street"" played in full that is so perfectly placed it seemed as thought the song were written specifically for this film.  Another remarkable moment.  The pace is deliberately slow, the plot jumps back and forth in time, and some of the scenes seem staged for the benefit of Billy Crudup, but overall this is a moving experience.  The writing is also excellent but sounds more like a play than a screenplay.  However, this is a landmark event for Billy Crudup, and a completely different character than Russell Hammond in the film ""Almost Famous.""

Only he didn't plan on Sarah (Jennifer Connelly).  Sarah is a free spirited, radical human rights advocate.  We meet them on the day she dies and then flash back to the inception of their relationship in 1972.  He is The Establishment personified.  She is an iconoclast.  Two philosophies more incompatible could not possibly exist, but despite everything, they fall in love.The story then fast-forwards to Fielding's campaign for the House of Representatives ten years after Sarah's death.  It is at this time that Fielding becomes obsessed with Sarah's ghost.  He believes he is seeing her everywhere and that he is surely losing his mind.  He begins to question his own philosophies and begins to lose his will to win the election.The film is an engrossing character study of two very fascinating people cut of completely different cloth.  The non-linear approach used by Director Keith Gordon was both a blessing and a curse.  Sometimes it provided important character development and motivation and at others, it jumped back and forth for no good reason.  This often made the film seem disjointed and hard to follow.  Gordon's direction was only fair, though he delivered accurate period renderings especially of the 1970's.  There were too many instances of unnecessary stylizing.  For instance, there was excessive use of monologue jump cuts, where he cut from the speaker saying one thing to the same speaker in the same spot saying something else.  He used it so often that it looked like bad editing.In addition, Gordon tended to focus on the schmaltzy romantic angle and downplayed the far more interesting philosophical tension.  He did give us some dialectic, but generally cut away when the philosophical fireworks were just getting started.  He also kept treading over the same ground in different ways.  This made the story drag.The acting by both leads was terrific.  This film brings Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly together again, both having appeared in ""Inventing the Abbotts"".  Crudup was extremely impressive as the tormented politician.  This was an exquisitely complex character and Crudup flexed the role to the max.  Connelly was a bit more uneven in her role, sometimes playing the role with great force, but at others with a mousy self-consciousness that was inconsistent with the character.  Still, she gave Sarah great depth as both a lover and a crusader, and a convincing passion for her beliefs.This is an absorbing but slow moving romance that is a bit heavy handed, but nonetheless interesting.  I rated it a 7/10.  It showcases good performances by two young actors we will surely hear from again.

Fiedling, a young ambitious man with dreams of becoming a senator finds his life entangled with his lover, Sarah. Sarah, a devoted activist who is dedicated to her missionary work loves Fielding so much that it is in fact ""infuriating"" and that feeling is mutual as well. Sarah and Fielding are deeply in love but their careers are so different and so demanding that it does seem implausible for this couple to succeed. Fielding and Sarah both know their careers are on total opposite sides of the field but manage to cope with patronizing politicians or sensitive activists; however, Fieldings life is drastically  changed when Sarah dies in a car bomb in chile. Fielding, distraught over his loss, moves on; before you know it it is the year 1982; he enagages in a new relationship with his mentor's niece and is offered a seat in the senate after working with the Chicago DA. Things are all happening way too fast for Fielding as he must prepare for his close election. Things take a turn for fielding as he experiences auditory and visual hallucinations of Sarah and creates these dillusions. Why are these visions haunting him now after all these years? His family having a pertained liking to Fielding's fiance, Sarah, are concerned for him and worried about his ill being. Is love haunting or is it possible to literally wake the dead?This movie is stunning, an outstanding performance by both Jennifer Connelly and Billy Crudup. It is a shame to see the little amount of recognition this film recieves now as well as at the box office in 2000. However, Their on screen chemistry is plausible with realistic dialogue along with a touching soundtrack. What makes this Romantic movie distinct and unique besides the beautiful Jennifer Connelly  is the satisfaction of the ending; it does not leave the audience guessing or pondering upon the thought of is she alive is she dead...instead we rely upon the alleviation of Fielding's unrest and his new career ahead of him.

Touted as a ""Thinking Man's Romance"", I found it intelligent and accessible. Usually films touted as ""The Thinking (Whatever)"" are sophomoric, poorly written pieces of [junk]. Waking the Dead is neither of those things. It combines an engaging story with powerful performances by Crudup and Connelly. The movie is a thriller without the hangups thrillers are usually stuck with, and at the same time, a romantic movie that leaves you refreshed instead of having a syrupy aftertaste. Crudup continues his string of great performances, and Connelly continues to be involved in great projects. Hopefully her role will not be forgotten as quickly this time.

486526,A332MW6OA1LYDF,6306010939,John Noodles,"[9, 28]","This movie is the kind of garbage you might find on the Lifetime channel.  I was embarrassed for the actors who appeared in this gut-wrenching emotion-fest.  Both Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connolly are fine actors, and anyone offended by mawkish sentimentality will wince at some of the lines they are made to speak in this in this awful, maudlin, frustrating movie.Billy Crudup plays a super-decent, super-caring, super-sensitive Democratic (of course--just one of this movie's many cliches) Congressional contender. Jennifer Connolly is his lover from some 10 years ago, who he believes has been killed in Chile rescuing people from a despotic regime.  Their affair is told through flashbacks. They have long senstive conversations.  When they fight, they don't really fight--they are both too decent to yell at the other.  They just look hurt, and we *know* that this is a very meaningful non-fight. Naturally, he is a gentle lover; she weeps during sex. Everyone in this movie is terribly earnest, and LOVES to talk about what they're feeling. In other words: This is the &Uuml;ber Chick Movie!But then, when Crudup's character is running for office, he begins seeing Connolly...around, sometimes out of the corner of his eye, sometimes everywhere, a flock of her coming at him.  It seems likely...likely that she's alive...or is it his imagination?  We're never given a convincing reason why, if Connolly is still alive, she has been in hiding all these years, or how such a sensitive, decent person could justify doing what she did to him.  If she isn't alive...then ole Fielding is hallucinating and is, therefore, a psychopath, and the whole idea that he could sustain a campaign, let alone get elected, is laughable.There is one remarkably inept scene in which Crudup's character Fielding is eating with Connolly, her church coworkers (two priests), and 4 Chilean nationals they have just rescued.  One of the Chilean women confronts Fielding on his desire to become a politician, condemning him specifically for becoming an American politician, and we--like Fielding--feel the others in the room silently agreeing with her.  Fielding explodes (but decently!), pointing out their hypocrisy, and how, despite the world's finger-pointing at Americans, it is OUR shores they so often wash up on when fleeing the terror of their homelands.  Finally, he declares that he is &quot;choking on the collective superiority in this room!&quot; It is a good line, and he delivers a great tirade...but everyone (except, perhaps, the Chileans) in this movie is so darn nice, and good and wholesome, that we can't believe for a minute that they can't see Fielding's goodness, too.  So their collective superiority...it just doesn't ring true.In fact, very, very little in this movie rings true.  This is the sort of movie a 14-year-old girl wanting an adult love story might like; it displays precisely that sort of idealized emotional maturity.  Few discerning adults will be able to stomach it.  Even my wife (who is the reason I sat through it) disliked it.Do yourself a favor.

486527,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6306010939,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","""Waking the Dead"" is an odd and politically oriented love story that didn't really get to me until the final scene. It's not a bad movie, not boring or anything, but I didn't really buy the love element until the end. Billy Crudup(Almost Famous, Jesus' Son) plays Fielding, an aspiring Senator who meetsSarah (Oscar Winner Jennifer Connelly) who's one of those foreign activists simalar to Angelina Jolie. Despite their differences, Fielding and Sarah fall in love until Sarah dies in a car bombing accident...Apparently. The movie jumps between 1973 & 1974 to 1984, where Fielding is now running for Congress and is dating his mentor's niece. But, for some reason, Fielding (and a few other people) see Sarah occasionally; She has even called him.But Fielding doesn't know if it's a figment of his imagination or if he actually woke the dead. I think that the problem with this movie is that it deals with the political aspect a little bit more than it needs too. I want to see the Fielding and Sarah love story more than I wanted to see Fielding's blossoming political career. But this is a pretty good movie and a lot of the scenes are effective. I like how the writer didn't cave at the end of the movie and come up with some ridiculous excuse for an ending and instead left us to wonder. Crudup & Connelly are both great in their roles, especially Crudup.The dialouge between the two, I thought was quite good as well. Like:Sarah: Sometimes it's so infuriating loving you.Fielding: The feeling's mutual.Little things like that that go unnoticed.

Waking the Dead shall be considered a masterpiece of historic, as well as behavioral standpoint. From mid 60's to late 70's, the World has changed in a way we - the baby boomers, cannot forget, yet we find an intense difficulty to forward those values to today's generations. As I was a grown man at the time, the film touches me particularly through the process of bringing back the political process in the Americas by then.Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Cuba and the US were in turmoil: in politics, in the Arts, everywhere. However, we still remained deeply marked by a certain blend of idealism, naiveness and a remarkable determination to correctness in every aspect of Life. Those values seem to have vanished in present times!This said, it becomes easier to understand the script behind the scenes and the disturbances in Fielding's mind. Crudup's interpretation should have earned him the Oscar, but not alone.Jennifer Connelly's Sarah was so real that has trascended her natural and amazing beauty to produce a couple in love which rarely exists today.Their love scenes approached moments of ECTASY very few actor/actresses have the power to produce so realisticaly. Jennifer's path to her deserved Oscar with A Beatiful Mind was clearly set thereat.One must have lived those experiences to understand that everything in the movie looks like watching tapes - of real life - long buried in his/her mind.Thank you Gordon, for this movie!Thank you Crudup, for your remarkable talent and for reminding us of cruel times and the victory of love over them;Thank you, Jennifer, for making us forget your amazing beauty and concentrate on your mesmerizing Sarah.An absolute marterpiece!",5,"Absolutely mesmerizing...Real life, at last!",1029283200,"08 14, 2002",2002,1770,"['Very', 'few', 'movies', 'remain', 'mind', 'long', 'long', 'curtain', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'shall', 'be', 'considered', 'masterpiece', 'historic', 'as', 'well', 'behavioral', 'standpoint', 'mid', '60', 'late', '70', 'World', 'changed', 'way', 'baby', 'boomers', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'yet', 'find', 'intense', 'difficulty', 'forward', 'values', 'today', 'generations', 'was', 'grown', 'man', 'time', 'film', 'touches', 'particularly', 'process', 'bringing', 'back', 'political', 'process', 'Americas', 'then.Chile', 'Brazil', 'Argentina', 'Bolivia', 'Peru', 'Cuba', 'US', 'were', 'turmoil', 'politics', 'Arts', 'everywhere', 'However', 'still', 'remained', 'deeply', 'marked', 'certain', 'blend', 'idealism', 'naiveness', 'remarkable', 'determination', 'correctness', 'aspect', 'Life', 'values', 'seem', 'have', 'vanished', 'present', 'times', 'said', 'easier', 'understand', 'script', 'scenes', 'disturbances', 'Fielding', 'mind', 'Crudup', 'interpretation', 'should', 'have', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'not', 'alone.Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Sarah', 'was', 'so', 'real', 'trascended', 'natural', 'amazing', 'beauty', 'produce', 'couple', 'love', 'rarely', 'today.Their', 'love', 'scenes', 'approached', 'moments', 'ECTASY', 'very', 'few', 'actor/actresses', 'have', 'power', 'produce', 'so', 'realisticaly', 'Jennifer', 'path', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Beatiful', 'Mind', 'was', 'clearly', 'set', 'thereat.One', 'must', 'have', 'lived', 'experiences', 'understand', 'everything', 'movie', 'watching', 'tapes', 'real', 'life', 'long', 'buried', 'his/her', 'mind.Thank', 'Gordon', 'movie', 'Thank', 'Crudup', 'remarkable', 'talent', 'reminding', 'cruel', 'times', 'victory', 'love', 'Thank', 'Jennifer', 'making', 'forget', 'amazing', 'beauty', 'concentrate', 'mesmerizing', 'Sarah.An', 'absolute', 'marterpiece']",Waking the Dead VHS

If it weren't for Jodie Foster's production company, Scott Spencer's remarkable novel would never have seen the big screen and Keith Gordon would only be remembered primarily for the very dark indie &quot;Mother Night.&quot;  Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly would never have graced the big screen together so strongly as they had in Pat O'Connor's &quot;Inventing The Abbotts&quot; and the world would never have known what true love really is.The basic premise of the film is that young Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup), a budding politician, cannot forget his former girlfriend, Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly), who was killed in a violent terrorist action years before.  As a matter of fact, as his life comes to a crossroads and he is about to enter the U.S. Senate, her face, her image, and her voice haunt his every moment, causing him to question everything about his present existence.  Fielding sees and hears Sarah everywhere around him; is she really dead, or is she still alive?First and foremost, it should be noted that Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly show more stunning on-screen chemistry than any other couple I have ever watched before.  From the moment Crudup cries at the image of Connelly on the television, on through the next 106 minutes, you are totally convinced that these two are in love.  It is beyond captivating; as a matter of fact, it is nearly alarming how they interact.  They are just THAT perfect.  The direction and screenplay (mostly done by Keith Gordon, although the script is credited to someone else due to WGA regulation) are exquisite, not contrived and desperate as some love stories go.  The supporting cast contains Academy-Award nominees Ed Harris (in a cameo) and Janet McTeer, as well as the beautiful Molly Parker and the enormously talented Sandra Oh.  Each of them hit the mark.Like &quot;Map Of The World,&quot; a film that came out the same week, &quot;Waking The Dead&quot; was ignored by the Academy but certainly should have been lauded for its amazing acting, direction and screenplay as well as the beautifully stark image of love lasting forever that encompassed the entire film.  For me, it is difficult to imagine how something of this calibre could have been ignored.  But, in my heart, I know that the first month of the decade gave us the best film of the next ten years.  You don't need the Academy to tell you that.

In Fielding's life post Sarah we see him as a shadow of the man he formerly was, who begins to see Sarah everywhere. This slowly wears at the fabric of his sanity. He isn't sure if he is being haunted by her ghost or if she had gone into hiding.The amazing thing about the film is it touches on some of the real concepts of love. How you can care about a person even though they drive you insane at times.

After all, this movie is not a ghost story, even though the main character is haunted by the dead woman that he loved, but a film that mixes romance and politics to the point where the film's big question really matters and should have been answered more directly.In 1982 a stunned Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) learns form the evening news that the woman he loves, Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connely) has been killed by a car bomb attack because of her involvement in opposing the corrupt government of Chile and U.S. involvement.  We then go back to see how they first met, when he was serving in the Coast Guard, to avoid going to Vietnam, and she was the secretary for his brother, who is running some sort of counter culture magazine.  He longs for a career in politics and she wants to bring down the system.  Yet when Fielding says he wants to be president some day, she smiles because he clearly means it.These two characters from Scott Spencer's novel are politically polarized and these differences only grow as the two fall in love.  They take turns accompanying each other to important social functions at which the other one become an embarrassment, before Sarah goes off and gets killed for her beliefs.  Ten years later Fielding is given the opportunity to run in a special election for a seat in the U.S. Congress, as the handpicked choice of the governor and his chief political hack (Hal Holbrook).  This is the first step to what Fielding has wanted his entire life, only Sarah sees it as a betrayal.  True, Sarah has been dead ten years at this point, but that does not stop Fielding from first hearing and then seeing her.Is Fielding going insane, is he being haunted, or is this some sort of sick game?  Good question, but do not ask me the answer because I watched the movie.  It is hard to spoil a movie when you are not sure what really happened at the end, although I could hazard a guess.  Ultimately, the politics clashes between Fielding and Sarah are more interesting than their romance.  You have to wonder how their relationship would have ended if she had not died, because sooner or later one of them would have had to blink.  One of the strengths of &quot;Waking the Dead&quot; is that both of them are right and you think that if only they could find a way to work together great things could happen.&quot;Waking the Dead&quot; is one of those titles that has a double meaning, for it applies to Fielding as much as it does to Sarah.  That sense of ambiguity pervades Keith Gordon's 2000 film and certainly explains why the ending is so open to interpretation.  But for me it does not quite work in the end, although Fielding's scene in his Congressional office works much better than his dinner with his family.  Still, this is an interesting film for those who like to see film that try to play with an audience's mind (and which should be avoid like the plague by those who did enjoy &quot;Fight Club&quot; or &quot;Memento&quot;).",4,Fielding Pierce runs for Congress haunted by his dead love,1075593600,"02 1, 2004",2004,3227,"['Things', 'get', 'little', 'too', 'cute', 'end', 'quot', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'quot', 'appreciate', 'idea', 'leaving', 'up', 'what', 'quot', 'really', 'quot', 'happened', 'audience', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'try', 'particular', 'trick', 'movie', 'not', 'ghost', 'story', 'even', 'main', 'character', 'haunted', 'dead', 'woman', 'loved', 'film', 'romance', 'politics', 'point', 'where', 'film', 'big', 'question', 'really', 'matters', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'answered', 'more', 'directly.In', '1982', 'stunned', 'Fielding', 'Pierce', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'form', 'evening', 'news', 'woman', 'Sarah', 'Williams', 'Jennifer', 'Connely', 'been', 'killed', 'car', 'bomb', 'attack', 'involvement', 'opposing', 'corrupt', 'government', 'Chile', 'U.S.', 'involvement', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'how', 'first', 'met', 'when', 'was', 'serving', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'avoid', 'going', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'secretary', 'brother', 'who', 'running', 'sort', 'counter', 'culture', 'magazine', 'career', 'politics', 'bring', 'down', 'system', 'when', 'Fielding', 'be', 'president', 'day', 'clearly', 'it.These', 'two', 'characters', 'Scott', 'Spencer', 'novel', 'are', 'politically', 'polarized', 'differences', 'only', 'grow', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'take', 'turns', 'accompanying', 'other', 'important', 'social', 'functions', 'other', 'one', 'become', 'embarrassment', 'Sarah', 'off', 'killed', 'beliefs', 'Ten', 'years', 'later', 'Fielding', 'given', 'opportunity', 'run', 'special', 'election', 'seat', 'U.S.', 'Congress', 'handpicked', 'choice', 'governor', 'chief', 'political', 'hack', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'first', 'step', 'what', 'Fielding', 'wanted', 'entire', 'life', 'only', 'Sarah', 'betrayal', 'True', 'Sarah', 'been', 'dead', 'ten', 'years', 'point', 'not', 'stop', 'Fielding', 'first', 'hearing', 'then', 'seeing', 'her.Is', 'Fielding', 'going', 'insane', 'being', 'haunted', 'sort', 'sick', 'game', 'Good', 'question', 'do', 'not', 'ask', 'answer', 'watched', 'movie', 'hard', 'spoil', 'movie', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'end', 'could', 'hazard', 'guess', 'Ultimately', 'politics', 'clashes', 'Fielding', 'Sarah', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'romance', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'relationship', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'had', 'not', 'died', 'sooner', 'later', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'blink', 'One', 'strengths', 'quot', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'quot', 'are', 'right', 'think', 'only', 'could', 'find', 'way', 'work', 'together', 'great', 'things', 'could', 'happen.', 'quot', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'quot', 'one', 'titles', 'double', 'meaning', 'Fielding', 'as', 'much', 'Sarah', 'sense', 'ambiguity', 'pervades', 'Keith', 'Gordon', '2000', 'film', 'certainly', 'why', 'ending', 'so', 'open', 'interpretation', 'not', 'quite', 'work', 'end', 'Fielding', 'scene', 'Congressional', 'office', 'much', 'better', 'dinner', 'family', 'Still', 'interesting', 'film', 'who', 'like', 'see', 'film', 'try', 'play', 'audience', 'mind', 'should', 'be', 'avoid', 'plague', 'who', 'did', 'enjoy', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot']",Waking the Dead VHS

His longing for her is so strong after her passing that his desire to see her begins to make him question his sanity.  Anybody who has lost someone important to them should be able to relate.  Billy Crudup from ""Mission Impossible III"" plays the young lawyer/politician Fielding Pierce.  He takes the performance to the edge with his desperation.  Jennifer Connelly who won her Oscar for ""A Beautiful Mind"" the year before this film plays Sarah, a woman who is politically driven, which puts her in danger.  Janet McTeer, who did an excellent job inSongcatcher& who was nominated for an Oscar for ""Tumbleweeds,"" plays Fielding's sister who is his emotional support.

Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudu) is a young Coast Guard officer with political ambitions.  He meets and falls in love with Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly) a young hippie-type idealist that is also Catholic and supports their causes.  She has doubts about her role as his wife as he climbs the political ladder.Fielding sees a news show on Sarah's death.  A news anchor reports on a car bombing in Minneapolis following a church mission to Chile.  Sarah wants to help the oppressed resist Chile's right wing government.  After the news show, Fielding has flashbacks, hears Sarah's voice, sees a young Sarah and cannot forget her.He feels he is going crazy with his unresolved grief.

Connelly is the girl he falls for, and she's a radical who takes on all kinds of causes, ultimately ending in her tragic death...or is she really dead?In the 80s, Crudup starts seeing Connelly and thinks she might be losing his mind, which wouldn't serve his goals as a candidate for Congress.The movie is long on dialogue and director Keith Gordon gives us some pretty visual images and elicits good performances from the cast.But the real situation with Connelly's fate is romanticized and ultimately left for us to decide the truth.Romantics will probably enjoy this a little more than I did.",3,LOVE AFTER DEATH,1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,968,"['DEAD', 'one', 'movies', 'even', 'competently', 'done', 'very', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'entertaining', 'rather', 'somber', 'love', 'story', 'well', 'acted', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly.Set', 'early', '1970s', 'early', '1980s', 'story', 'Crudup', 'up', 'coming', 'brilliant', 'law', 'student', 'who', 'be', 'president', 'someday', 'Connelly', 'girl', 'radical', 'who', 'kinds', 'causes', 'ultimately', 'ending', 'tragic', 'death', 'really', 'dead', '80s', 'Crudup', 'seeing', 'Connelly', 'might', 'be', 'losing', 'mind', 'would', ""n't"", 'serve', 'goals', 'candidate', 'Congress.The', 'movie', 'long', 'dialogue', 'director', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'pretty', 'visual', 'images', 'elicits', 'good', 'performances', 'cast.But', 'real', 'situation', 'Connelly', 'fate', 'romanticized', 'ultimately', 'left', 'decide', 'truth.Romantics', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'little', 'more', 'did']",Waking the Dead VHS
486536,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,6306010939,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[0, 0]","Based on a novel of the same title by Scott Spencer. Producer Jodie Foster pitched this movie as ""GHOST for grown ups"". The tale is about two lovers who possess great passion for one another (Jennifer Connelly and Billy Cruddup improvised many scenes to get comfortable with their characters for love scenes and the like) but though both liberal for their times they have very different means as to solving various problems.It isn't a spoiler to say that the female love interest dies and the man tries to get on with his life but keeps seeing her wherever he goes. It gets to the point of whether his visions of her are of him expressing his grief or him actually seeing her.Anyway, the man, who had always dreamed of becoming a politician, becomes one but is then jaded. Notice the colors going out in the later years of his life to reflect his loss of idealism in politics. There are some very interesting themes about love which is probably the main reason as to why the novel was turned into a movie. When you love somebody and they become a part of your life they're still going to be real to you in your life even if they're dead or faraway or out of your life romantically. That's the big point about love. For this man yes she may be dead or something else but she had an impact on his life and stays in his heart until his dying days and maybe thereafter.By the way, this is one of those rare Jennifer Connelly movies that shows her acting talents which is a nice change from her being the oh so ""pretty-chesty"", supportive girlfriend. Younger men won't get this picture or so the stats said when they tested it. During the testing that group was uncomfortable with the movie. No surprise there. The ending has a nice turnaround as the main character begins to see the world as his girlfriend saw people: in pain and in need of compassion. It probably didn't make much a ton at the Box Office but it said a lot more to me about the human experience than most of the summer action flicks.STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; LOVE FOCUSES: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus (for it's year); WHEN WATCHED: early April 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.",4,MY GRADE: B to B plus.,1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,2198,"['Based', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'Scott', 'Spencer', 'Producer', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'pitched', 'movie', 'GHOST', 'grown', 'ups', 'tale', 'two', 'lovers', 'who', 'possess', 'great', 'passion', 'one', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Billy', 'Cruddup', 'improvised', 'many', 'scenes', 'get', 'comfortable', 'characters', 'love', 'scenes', 'like', 'liberal', 'times', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'means', 'solving', 'various', 'problems.It', ""n't"", 'spoiler', 'say', 'female', 'love', 'interest', 'dies', 'man', 'get', 'life', 'seeing', 'wherever', 'point', 'visions', 'are', 'expressing', 'grief', 'actually', 'seeing', 'her.Anyway', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'always', 'dreamed', 'becoming', 'politician', 'one', 'then', 'jaded', 'Notice', 'colors', 'going', 'out', 'later', 'years', 'life', 'reflect', 'loss', 'idealism', 'politics', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'themes', 'love', 'probably', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'novel', 'was', 'turned', 'movie', 'When', 'love', 'somebody', 'become', 'part', 'life', ""'re"", 'still', 'going', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'even', ""'re"", 'dead', 'faraway', 'life', 'romantically', 'big', 'point', 'love', 'man', 'may', 'be', 'dead', 'something', 'else', 'had', 'impact', 'life', 'stays', 'heart', 'dying', 'days', 'maybe', 'thereafter.By', 'way', 'one', 'rare', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'movies', 'acting', 'talents', 'nice', 'change', 'being', 'oh', 'pretty-chesty', 'supportive', 'girlfriend', 'Younger', 'men', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'picture', 'so', 'stats', 'said', 'when', 'tested', 'testing', 'group', 'was', 'uncomfortable', 'movie', 'surprise', 'there', 'ending', 'nice', 'turnaround', 'main', 'character', 'see', 'world', 'girlfriend', 'saw', 'people', 'pain', 'need', 'compassion', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'ton', 'Box', 'Office', 'said', 'lot', 'more', 'human', 'experience', 'most', 'summer', 'action', 'flicks.STORY/PLOTTING', 'B', 'minus', 'B', 'CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE', 'B', 'B', 'LOVE', 'FOCUSES', 'B', 'A', 'minus', 'CINEMATOGRAPHY', 'B', 'B', 'year', 'WHEN', 'WATCHED', 'early', 'April', '2012', 'OVERALL', 'GRADE', 'B', 'B', 'plus']",Waking the Dead VHS

486544,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6306010939,Reviewer,"[5, 5]","The circumstances surrounding the death of a young woman-- a peace activist working with a church organization in Minneapolis-- and it's effect on her lover, an aspiring politician, initiates a character study underscored with mystery in ""Waking the Dead,"" directed by Keith Gordon.  The movie begins by picking up the story in 1974, with a news report of the death of one Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly), then flashes back to 1972, when Sarah and Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) first met.  Then the story flashes forward to 1982, where we learn what's become of Fielding since Sarah's death.  The entire story unfolds in this manner-- flashing back and forth between `72 and `82, and finally between `73 and `83-- and it proves to be a very effective method of storytelling; it allows the viewer to get to know and understand Fielding intimately, as his character is developed succinctly through pivotal episodes in his life.  And it works just as well with Sarah's character, though her death ultimately becomes shrouded in mystery.  A good director will let his audience know in the first few minutes of a film exactly what can be expected from what follows, and from the opening frame Gordon establishes the method through which his story will be told, and it works beautifully.  Ultimately, he creates an atmosphere in which the story thrives and maintains a pace that keeps it alive, while exacting performances from his actors that conclusively make it a memorable film.  The story is character driven:  Two people share the same principles and ideals and love each other deeply, but disagree on the methods by which to effect their goals.  And Crudup and Connelly are more than up to the task of carrying the film; their respective performances are outstanding.  Connelly especially captures the depth of Sarah's commitment and drive, while presenting a physical and emotional presence that personifies `70s sensibilities, up to and including the sacrifices she is willing to bear in order to ""Make a difference"" in the world.  Crudup, meanwhile, successfully captures the essence of a young man in conflict, torn between whether to forego all in the name of principle, or to attempt to resolve the same issues through established and recognized channels of mainstream society, buying into the ""Establishment,"" as it were.  Crudup achieves an emotional level that aptly conveys the inner turmoil with which he must live without respite; a personal struggle that threatens to destroy him.  It's a powerful performance that, along with his turn in ""Almost Famous,"" should establish him as one of the best young actors in the business today.  The supporting cast includes Molly Parker (Juliet), Janet McTeer (Caroline), Paul Hipp (Danny), Sandra Oh (Kim), Hal Holbrook (Isaac) and Ed Harris in a cameo as Jerry Carmichael.  In the final analysis, ""Waking the Dead"" is a pensive, thought provoking film that will grab you intellectually as well as emotionally; Gordon maintains a tension throughout the film, and a sense of mystery, that compels the emotional involvement of the audience.  And with the riveting presence and performances of the darkly winsome Connelly and the charismatic Crudup, it makes for a satisfying film-going experience that demonstrates what the magic of the movies is all about.",4,Character Driven Drama,981331200,"02 5, 2001",2001,3312,"['circumstances', 'surrounding', 'death', 'young', 'woman', 'peace', 'activist', 'working', 'church', 'organization', 'Minneapolis', 'effect', 'lover', 'aspiring', 'politician', 'character', 'study', 'underscored', 'mystery', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'directed', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'movie', 'picking', 'up', 'story', '1974', 'news', 'report', 'death', 'one', 'Sarah', 'Williams', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'then', 'back', '1972', 'when', 'Sarah', 'Fielding', 'Pierce', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'first', 'met', 'Then', 'story', 'forward', '1982', 'where', 'learn', 'what', 'become', 'Fielding', 'Sarah', 'death', 'entire', 'story', 'unfolds', 'manner', 'flashing', 'back', 'forth', '72', '82', 'finally', '73', '83', 'be', 'very', 'effective', 'method', 'storytelling', 'viewer', 'get', 'know', 'understand', 'Fielding', 'intimately', 'character', 'developed', 'succinctly', 'pivotal', 'episodes', 'life', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'Sarah', 'character', 'death', 'ultimately', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'good', 'director', 'will', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'what', 'opening', 'frame', 'Gordon', 'method', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'told', 'beautifully', 'Ultimately', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'thrives', 'pace', 'alive', 'exacting', 'performances', 'actors', 'conclusively', 'make', 'memorable', 'film', 'story', 'character', 'driven', 'Two', 'people', 'share', 'same', 'principles', 'ideals', 'love', 'other', 'deeply', 'disagree', 'methods', 'effect', 'goals', 'Crudup', 'Connelly', 'are', 'more', 'up', 'task', 'carrying', 'film', 'respective', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Connelly', 'especially', 'depth', 'Sarah', 'commitment', 'drive', 'presenting', 'physical', 'emotional', 'presence', '70s', 'sensibilities', 'up', 'including', 'sacrifices', 'willing', 'bear', 'order', 'Make', 'difference', 'world', 'Crudup', 'meanwhile', 'successfully', 'essence', 'young', 'man', 'conflict', 'torn', 'forego', 'name', 'principle', 'attempt', 'resolve', 'same', 'issues', 'established', 'recognized', 'channels', 'mainstream', 'society', 'buying', 'Establishment', 'were', 'Crudup', 'emotional', 'level', 'aptly', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'must', 'live', 'respite', 'personal', 'struggle', 'destroy', 'powerful', 'performance', 'turn', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'should', 'establish', 'one', 'best', 'young', 'actors', 'business', 'today', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'Juliet', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'Caroline', 'Paul', 'Hipp', 'Danny', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'Kim', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Isaac', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'cameo', 'Jerry', 'Carmichael', 'final', 'analysis', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'pensive', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'will', 'grab', 'intellectually', 'as', 'well', 'emotionally', 'Gordon', 'tension', 'film', 'sense', 'mystery', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'audience', 'riveting', 'presence', 'performances', 'darkly', 'winsome', 'Connelly', 'charismatic', 'Crudup', 'satisfying', 'film-going', 'experience', 'what', 'magic', 'movies']",Waking the Dead VHS
486545,A1ALOEZ4NXHUT,6306010939,"R.L. Holly ""piper909""","[26, 26]","Keith Gordon has again bowled me over with a magnificent piece of filmmaking.  ""Waking the Dead"" shares many of the same elements as his ""A Midnight Clear"" (still in my view the best WWII drama of modern times) -- a skillful adaptation of a powerful novel,  intense performances from the entire cast, and careful attention to the rhythm and pacing of his story.  And two other things that are especially rare in today's mainstream movies: the deliberate ambiguity of the ending and nuanced characters that are neither black nor white but multiple shades of grey. Hollywood must hate this, and it must baffle many moviegoers.  The general public is force-fed so many lifeless, undemanding,  predictable movies with cardboard characters that they probably didn't reward this gem at the box office (Gordon's commentary track implies that this movie was a semi-flop, commercially, which is tragic -- and probably makes it only harder for him to continue to shoot quality films).  One hopes ""Waking the Dead"" will find its audience on home video, much as the well-respected ""A Midnight Clear"" (which I saw several times in the theatre) seems to have.Another reviewer has pointed out the double-meaning behind the title -- the ""dead"" here refers to both Sarah, believed to be physically dead, and Fielding, who has found his soul wasting away since losing her.  Can Fielding bring himself  as well as Sarah back to life?  The story  is  also tellingly noncommittal as to Sarah's actual status.  By the end of the film, we still don't know if Sarah is  secretly alive, a ghost from the other side, or simply a product of Fielding's mental breakdown.  Everything in the script leaves the question wide open for interpretation, and the effect is both chilling and intensely moving.  The emotional wave of the story builds to a final confrontation between the principal characters that is truly heart-rending.I think this is one of those movies best served by a review that does not give away too many surprises or attempt to detail too much of the plotline.  Suffice to say that if you appreciate a human-scale drama that operates on several levels of meaning, you will find yourself drawn in by this one and riveted by the performances of Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly.  It's a film that only gets richer and more rewarding with every viewing.  Looking for a love story/ghost story for grown-ups? ""Waking the Dead"" is a sure-fire winner.Some parting notes:Most directors  today hit you over the head with the soundtrack music and then lazily try to let the songs carry the picture.  While Gordon is not totally above this contemporary shorthand, he has enough good taste and filmmaking savvy not to let this technique dominate these scenes. And his musical selections are spot-on.Although Connelly and Crudup are THE key players, the entire cast  is outstanding, and deserves a bow.The DVD extras are generous and revealing.  Unlike the deleted scenes from Gordon's ""A Midnight Clear,"" which did seem disposable, I felt all these cut scenes SHOULD have been restored for a ""Waking the Dead"" Extended Cut.  It's sad that they can't  be part of the regular narrative; they add a wealth of character development and detail that would have made the theatrical version even richer.  Ed Harris, in particular, is deservedly singled out  by Gordon's commentary and reviewers here for his exceptional  portrayal of a disgraced congressman.I read the book AFTER I saw the film, being inspired to learn more about this story's genesis.  While very fine, I have to say that I still prefer the movie and its more immediate impact.  But that's par for the course -- I tend to always prefer the medium in which I was first exposed to something, be it print form or cinematic.  I would recommend the novel to anyone who likes the picture.  But I  note with some bemusement that Fielding seems a much less likable fellow in the book.",5,"Superb performances, direction in this haunting love story",1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,3914,"['Keith', 'Gordon', 'again', 'bowled', 'magnificent', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'shares', 'many', 'same', 'elements', 'A', 'Midnight', 'Clear', 'still', 'view', 'best', 'WWII', 'drama', 'modern', 'times', 'skillful', 'adaptation', 'powerful', 'novel', 'intense', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'careful', 'attention', 'rhythm', 'pacing', 'story', 'two', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'especially', 'rare', 'today', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'deliberate', 'ambiguity', 'ending', 'nuanced', 'characters', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'multiple', 'shades', 'grey', 'Hollywood', 'must', 'hate', 'must', 'baffle', 'many', 'moviegoers', 'general', 'public', 'force-fed', 'so', 'many', 'lifeless', 'undemanding', 'predictable', 'movies', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'reward', 'gem', 'box', 'office', 'Gordon', 'commentary', 'track', 'implies', 'movie', 'was', 'semi-flop', 'commercially', 'tragic', 'probably', 'only', 'harder', 'continue', 'shoot', 'quality', 'films', 'One', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'will', 'find', 'audience', 'home', 'video', 'much', 'well-respected', 'A', 'Midnight', 'Clear', 'saw', 'several', 'times', 'theatre', 'have.Another', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'double-meaning', 'title', 'dead', 'here', 'Sarah', 'believed', 'be', 'physically', 'dead', 'Fielding', 'who', 'found', 'soul', 'wasting', 'away', 'losing', 'Can', 'Fielding', 'bring', 'as', 'well', 'Sarah', 'back', 'life', 'story', 'also', 'tellingly', 'noncommittal', 'Sarah', 'actual', 'status', 'end', 'film', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Sarah', 'secretly', 'alive', 'ghost', 'other', 'side', 'simply', 'product', 'Fielding', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'Everything', 'script', 'question', 'wide', 'open', 'interpretation', 'effect', 'chilling', 'intensely', 'moving', 'emotional', 'wave', 'story', 'final', 'confrontation', 'principal', 'characters', 'truly', 'heart-rending.I', 'think', 'one', 'movies', 'best', 'served', 'review', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'surprises', 'attempt', 'detail', 'too', 'much', 'plotline', 'Suffice', 'say', 'appreciate', 'human-scale', 'drama', 'several', 'levels', 'meaning', 'will', 'find', 'drawn', 'one', 'riveted', 'performances', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'film', 'only', 'richer', 'more', 'rewarding', 'viewing', 'Looking', 'love', 'story/ghost', 'story', 'grown-ups', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'sure-fire', 'winner.Some', 'parting', 'notes', 'Most', 'directors', 'today', 'hit', 'head', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'then', 'lazily', 'try', 'let', 'songs', 'carry', 'picture', 'Gordon', 'not', 'totally', 'contemporary', 'shorthand', 'enough', 'good', 'taste', 'filmmaking', 'savvy', 'not', 'let', 'technique', 'dominate', 'scenes', 'musical', 'selections', 'are', 'spot-on.Although', 'Connelly', 'Crudup', 'are', 'THE', 'key', 'players', 'entire', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'bow.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'generous', 'revealing', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Gordon', 'A', 'Midnight', 'Clear', 'did', 'seem', 'disposable', 'felt', 'cut', 'scenes', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'restored', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'sad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'part', 'regular', 'narrative', 'add', 'wealth', 'character', 'development', 'detail', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'theatrical', 'version', 'even', 'richer', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'particular', 'deservedly', 'singled', 'out', 'Gordon', 'commentary', 'reviewers', 'here', 'exceptional', 'portrayal', 'disgraced', 'congressman.I', 'read', 'book', 'AFTER', 'saw', 'film', 'being', 'inspired', 'learn', 'more', 'story', 'genesis', 'very', 'fine', 'have', 'say', 'still', 'prefer', 'movie', 'more', 'immediate', 'impact', 'par', 'course', 'tend', 'always', 'prefer', 'medium', 'was', 'first', 'exposed', 'something', 'be', 'print', 'form', 'cinematic', 'would', 'recommend', 'novel', 'anyone', 'who', 'picture', 'note', 'bemusement', 'Fielding', 'much', 'less', 'likable', 'fellow', 'book']",Waking the Dead VHS

Who would have thought that the son in Rodney Dangerfield's &quot;Back to School&quot; would grow up to become the talented Keith Gordon, Director/Writer?  Not me.  Not that I ever entertained the thought, but you get my point.This film is haunting, sad, moving, and engaging.  It is not perfect and at times it can be frustrating.  Yet, it worked.  Usually, I like to have answers at the end of a film (that is my issue, not Gordon's).  Yet, this film didn't tie up all the loose ends--part of it's power is that you don't seem to care that it doesn't.  The film will also stay with you.  It is shot beautifully.I have some minor quibbles with the film--Connelly (in a fine performance) sometimes loses her &quot;southern&quot; accent (whereas the English Janet McTeer is flawless) and the sub-plot about the Korean hooker and Fielding's brother danny was a waste.Still, overall there is a quality to this film, that despite some flaws, it gets you think--and it gets you to feel.  This is more than I can say about much of what Hollywood puts out there today.The DVD has a fascinating audio commentary and some terrific deleted scenes.  You see more of a good performance by the solid Hal Holbrook.  Ed Harris is almost unrecognizable in his small role--he contines to be one of our most talented actors.

486548,A4CVQ8RX96FN3,6306010939,Rollo Tomassi,"[6, 6]","Perhaps Americans are simply ignorant of recent history, but still, I have a hard time believing that no one writing a review of this film has mentioned that Scott Spencer and Keith Gordon based the character of ""Sarah"" very closely on an actual person:  Ronni Moffitt, the young political activist killed in the car-bomb assassination of Chilean Orlando Letelier in 1976.  (agents of the Pinochet regime were convicted of the murders).  Some might say the particulars of Moffitt's life shouldn't really have much to do with the success or failure of Waking the Dead as a fictional dramatic work, and in a narrow sense, that's true.  But as the nature of this movie is the struggle of the higher duty of idealism vs. the earthly satisfaction of love, the real-life activism of Moffitt is relevant because of the way it ""grounds"" the idealism of Sarah.  As much as conservative believers in the supremacy of the self might want to think it absurd, there really were and are people who sacrific to make things better.  And the dramatic ""path"" of this movie is Fielding's slow back-and-forth realization, though the thickets of his lost love, of the ultimate importance of idealistic sacrific.  This is why the movie's final scene (don't worry -- I won't give it away here), which no one else has mentioned, is so crucially important.On the filmmaking details I have little to add.  Crudup and Connelly, superb in so many other films, are superb here.  Gordon's flashback-and-forward technique occasionally seems artsy but functions well enough in conveying the story.

I was thus certainly biased in a certain direction in favor of the book.Keith Gordon, who also directed the outstanding and under-appreciated films ""A Midnight Clear"" and ""Mother Night"", stays pretty much faithful to the original material by Scott Spencer.  It's obvious that films are different than books and directors need a certain amount lattitude to change the story as needed.  Gordon certainly left a lot of the story on the cutting room floor and that is, for the most part, not a problem.What is the problem is that Gordon didn't flesh out Sarah's story and, as a result, offers a skewed ending that the book doesn't share.Spoiler AlertSarah and Fielding are not ""opposites"" as many suggest.  They happen to agree politically.  They're both ""liberals.""  Where they disagree is on tactics.  The problem with the film is that we don't really see enough of Sarah to understand just how different her tactics are compared to Fielding and why, ultimately, she chose to go away.  The movie's ending is ambiguious about the fate of Sarah.  Did she die or didn't she?  The book shares some of this approach, but it strongly leans in the direction of Sarah having faked her death.  In the book Fielding meets with a priest who states that Sarah is alive.  And when Sarah and Fielding finally meet at the end Sarah explains how she is living underground and continuing her work.  We're given, at least in the text, a reason why Sarah chose the path that she did.  Gordon, however, mostly gives us Fielding's side of things.  In the process he detracts from the central conflict and ends up with a rather wishy-washy ending.I strongly recommend this film.  The DVD has many interesting extras, including many deleted scenes and a commentary by Gordon.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be anything on the DVD from the original author, Scott Spencer.  That's too bad because I think he could have added some really interesting insights about the story overall.  And of course, read the book which is, as usual, even better than the movie.",4,"Superb, but as usual, less than the book it was based upon",1090022400,"07 17, 2004",2004,2106,"['read', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'few', 'months', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'thus', 'certainly', 'biased', 'certain', 'direction', 'favor', 'book.Keith', 'Gordon', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'outstanding', 'under-appreciated', 'films', 'A', 'Midnight', 'Clear', 'Mother', 'Night', 'pretty', 'much', 'faithful', 'original', 'material', 'Scott', 'Spencer', 'obvious', 'films', 'are', 'different', 'books', 'directors', 'need', 'certain', 'amount', 'lattitude', 'change', 'story', 'needed', 'Gordon', 'certainly', 'left', 'lot', 'story', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'problem.What', 'problem', 'Gordon', 'did', ""n't"", 'flesh', 'out', 'Sarah', 'story', 'result', 'skewed', 'ending', 'book', ""n't"", 'share.Spoiler', 'AlertSarah', 'Fielding', 'are', 'not', 'opposites', 'many', 'suggest', 'happen', 'agree', 'politically', ""'re"", 'liberals', 'Where', 'disagree', 'tactics', 'problem', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'enough', 'Sarah', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'different', 'tactics', 'are', 'compared', 'Fielding', 'why', 'ultimately', 'chose', 'go', 'away', 'movie', 'ending', 'ambiguious', 'fate', 'Sarah', 'Did', 'die', 'did', ""n't"", 'book', 'shares', 'approach', 'strongly', 'direction', 'Sarah', 'having', 'faked', 'death', 'book', 'Fielding', 'meets', 'priest', 'who', 'Sarah', 'alive', 'when', 'Sarah', 'Fielding', 'finally', 'end', 'Sarah', 'how', 'living', 'underground', 'continuing', 'work', ""'re"", 'given', 'least', 'text', 'reason', 'why', 'Sarah', 'chose', 'path', 'did', 'Gordon', 'however', 'mostly', 'Fielding', 'side', 'things', 'process', 'central', 'conflict', 'up', 'rather', 'wishy-washy', 'ending.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'film', 'DVD', 'many', 'interesting', 'extras', 'including', 'many', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'Gordon', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'anything', 'DVD', 'original', 'author', 'Scott', 'Spencer', 'too', 'bad', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'really', 'interesting', 'insights', 'story', 'overall', 'course', 'read', 'book', 'usual', 'even', 'better', 'movie']",Waking the Dead VHS
486553,A1SPB225CVTRUU,6306010939,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[4, 8]","Waking Up The Dead is mysterious story about undying love, desires, and politics clash between two star-crossed lovers played by Jennifer Connelly(Sarah) and Billy Crudup(Fielding). There are many irreconcilable differences between the them, but for some reason, they were destined to be together for a some divine purposes, and both refuse to compromise their interests.Sarah is a church activist, and she goes out of her way to make the world a better place, including taking on life-threatening volunteer work in Chile. Her Boyfriend Fielding was raised by high-society politician parents, and he intended to ran for senator. She's very outspoken, and caused quite a scene when she expressed her angry opinions toward his fellow politician. During her sanctuary mission in Chile, she was reported dead in an attack, but it's not clear whether she did die or just faked it. Her ""death"" changed Fielding a great deal, and in the course of ten years span, he constantly thought about her, and imagined her still alive. His perspective and intensions on being a politician also gets reconsidered during election. Ultimately, he's the dead that gets awaken, because he was careless and selfish before Sarah ""died"". She had ""come back"" from the dead to awaken his true passion and kindness, so that he wouldn't become just part of the corrupted world of politicians.Jennifer Connelly and Billy Crudup had plenty of chemistry together, but she's more striking in group scenes. He's quite impressive when he gets the anxiety attack moments. Janet Mcteer's part is not very challenging for her, considered that she had done great work in the Oscar-nominated Tumbleweeds. Most disappointing thing was the casting of Sandra Oh as a Korean Massage worker. She get to deliver two lines in an supposedly authentic Korean accent, and she had just two scenes total. She really didn't have to take this tiny role, because she's a multi-award winning actress from Canada!",4,Billy Crudup Gets Awaken By Jennifer Connelly.,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,1956,"['Waking', 'Up', 'Dead', 'mysterious', 'story', 'undying', 'love', 'desires', 'politics', 'clash', 'two', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Sarah', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Fielding', 'are', 'many', 'irreconcilable', 'differences', 'reason', 'were', 'destined', 'be', 'together', 'divine', 'purposes', 'refuse', 'compromise', 'interests.Sarah', 'church', 'activist', 'way', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'including', 'taking', 'life-threatening', 'volunteer', 'work', 'Chile', 'Boyfriend', 'Fielding', 'was', 'raised', 'high-society', 'politician', 'parents', 'intended', 'ran', 'senator', 'very', 'outspoken', 'caused', 'quite', 'scene', 'when', 'expressed', 'angry', 'opinions', 'fellow', 'politician', 'sanctuary', 'mission', 'Chile', 'was', 'reported', 'dead', 'attack', 'not', 'clear', 'did', 'die', 'just', 'faked', 'death', 'changed', 'Fielding', 'great', 'deal', 'course', 'ten', 'years', 'span', 'constantly', 'thought', 'imagined', 'still', 'alive', 'perspective', 'intensions', 'being', 'politician', 'also', 'reconsidered', 'election', 'Ultimately', 'dead', 'awaken', 'was', 'careless', 'selfish', 'Sarah', 'died', 'had', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'awaken', 'true', 'passion', 'kindness', 'so', 'would', ""n't"", 'become', 'just', 'part', 'corrupted', 'world', 'politicians.Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'had', 'plenty', 'chemistry', 'together', 'more', 'striking', 'group', 'scenes', 'quite', 'impressive', 'when', 'anxiety', 'attack', 'moments', 'Janet', 'Mcteer', 'part', 'not', 'very', 'challenging', 'considered', 'had', 'done', 'great', 'work', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Tumbleweeds', 'Most', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'was', 'casting', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'Korean', 'Massage', 'worker', 'get', 'deliver', 'two', 'lines', 'supposedly', 'authentic', 'Korean', 'accent', 'had', 'just', 'two', 'scenes', 'total', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'take', 'tiny', 'role', 'multi-award', 'winning', 'actress', 'Canada']",Waking the Dead VHS
