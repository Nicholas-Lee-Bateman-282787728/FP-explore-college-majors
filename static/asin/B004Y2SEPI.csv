That's a disgrace - he deserves top billing!  Yes, the story was pretty much boiler plate tragic assassin turned hero who can't keep the girl & who's past won't leave him alone.  There were some slow spots & the flower garden was just too fake to be believed, BUT the fight choreography was fun & some of the scene framing was just amazing!  Gorgeous visuals - backdrops, costuming, contrasts, colors, etc!  It was artistically beautiful & made a nice contrast to the blood & guts (My favorite was when the sword went flying inches from his head & then as it passes by you see the hand (only) attached to it as it falls followed by a few body parts & a hat!  Then there's a scene where they show the analogy between dancing & sword practice routines (forgot the word for that) that was put to music which emphasized that analogy.  It was upbeat (which was kinda weird) but fun.  The circus characters were a strangely nice addition to the 'typical' town folk & gave it a surreal feel.  Their costumes were great (especially what they wore during their fight scene) & the sad clown who got terrorized by the bad guy's gang was priceless.  The secondary plot of the female lead & her journey to become strong & get revenge was pretty cool too.  I loved a scene towards the end when he (Dong Gun Jang) stepped aside & let her fight the villain from her past.  It was pretty brutal.  He never assisted, just watched & she got the crap beat out of her but in the end she got the evil creep.  That was refreshingly different & rewarding from a female point of view.  If you're looking for a deep, dramatic film, this isn't it.  But, it is a stylized, weird, sometimes funny, kick ass, western/martial arts film that I, at least, enjoyed watching.

In fact, this is what made the movie special for me. The set pieces were almost shocking in their detail and attention to how it interacts with the story. There is some definite eastern philosophy going on here. The acting was....okay. Nothing too terribly awesome, but it worked well within the fold of the story. The fighting was really cool i thought. However, i find myself going back to the sets and the amazing images when i think upon this flick. It was a truly beautiful movie depicting blood and gore. Quite the dichotomy. I think this would have benefited from an indie release rather than trying for a big market audience straight away like it did. It's a film that needed to build momentum. Anyway, i wont discuss the actual story here, but i think you should give it a viewing with an open mind and then think about how the movie made you feel afterwards.

I watched this movie five times, and I could watch it again. I used to be amazed, when watching a far fetched Spaghetti Western, when the characters would stop to reload their guns, after six shots they needed to reload but this never happened, they kept on shooting as if they had a hundred shots left, and the time when one could never understand how did the man killed three bad guys with one single shot, that's all you could hear, it was odd and as I said really far fetched but entertaining, totally comical, and I love it. Same thing with The Warrior's Way, however instead of guns we're using swords, beautiful ninja swords, as beautiful as the gun slingers' colt 45, and the speed the used it was impressive.

He is a member of the Sad Flutes clan, which gets its name from the sound of a throat being cut. He has killed all the members of a rival clan, except one, an infant girl. He cares for her and in doing so becomes the enemy of his clan, who try to kill him (and her.) Our warrior flees to American and ends up in a surreal looking town, located in the desert, occupied by circus people. They adopt him as one of their own. He is befriended by a black midget who reminded me a little of Captain Spaulding. A redheaded girl helps our warrior and becomes his student.After the movie establishes some characters and ties up some plot points, the town is attacked by a band of outlaws. Our warrior who has given up his life of killing, once again must kill. Oh yea, about this time his clan shows up as we end up in a three way fight.We have seen these movies a dozen times before. This one boasts some colorful characters that could have been better developed. The CG background with the magnificent colors was great.
