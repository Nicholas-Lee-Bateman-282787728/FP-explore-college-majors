1280973,A20QYY9BECJKMA,B002OHE1OI,Jennifer,"[0, 0]","Fascinating program about skyscrapers and which city in the United States will win the competition to ultimately have the country's tallest structure. Nice archival film footage of New York City in the 19th century, and of its first tall building (21 floors) built in 1902, known as the 'Flat-Iron Building' because of its shape. The United States is home to some of the world's tallest skyscrapers; eleven American buildings have held the title of tallest building in the world, and every titleholder from 1890 to 1998 was in the United States. The 10-story Home Insurance Building, built in Chicago in 1885, is regarded as the world's first skyscraper; the building was constructed using a novel steel load-bearing frame.From 1974 until 2013, the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) in Chicago was the tallest skyscraper in The United States. Prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, the twin towers of the World Trade Center occupied the second and third positions of tallest buildings in the U.S. They are the only buildings that would have qualified for the list but which are no longer standing. Chicago and New York have always been the centers of US skyscraper building. The eight tallest buildings in the US are either in New York City or Chicago, and of the top twenty-five buildings, eight are in Chicago and seven are in New York City.One World Trade Center (previously known as the Freedom Tower), built on the former World Trade Center site, became the tallest building in the United States in 2013. The Chicago Spire (previously known as the Fordham Spire) which was under construction in Chicago has been cancelled; it would have been the tallest building in the United States, rising 2,000 ft into the sky.Interesting interview with Donald Trump who wanted New York City to claim the title to having the tallest building in America, and it seems he won that bet with the building of the 'One World Trade Center'.This program documents the development of the Otis Elevator, modern air conditioning in office buildings, revolving doors, and 'dampers' which keep tall buildings from violent oscillating during heavy wind flow. There is even a New York architect who is conceptualizing a 500-story building which would take up 16 city blocks and rise more than one mile into the air. That would be amazing!Very interesting program. Not to be missed. I learned a lot on this subject matter, and I think you will, too. Really glad I found this program. So, would anyone care to touch the clouds inside a 500-story building? Might be a bit too high for me, but I don't know about you.....",5,I Wanna Touch The Clouds,1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,2619,"['Fascinating', 'program', 'skyscrapers', 'city', 'United', 'States', 'will', 'win', 'competition', 'ultimately', 'have', 'country', 'tallest', 'structure', 'Nice', 'archival', 'film', 'footage', 'New', 'York', 'City', '19th', 'century', 'first', 'tall', 'building', '21', 'floors', 'built', '1902', 'known', ""'Flat-Iron"", 'Building', 'shape', 'United', 'States', 'home', 'world', 'tallest', 'skyscrapers', 'eleven', 'American', 'buildings', 'have', 'held', 'title', 'tallest', 'building', 'world', 'titleholder', '1890', '1998', 'was', 'United', 'States', '10-story', 'Home', 'Insurance', 'Building', 'built', 'Chicago', '1885', 'regarded', 'world', 'first', 'skyscraper', 'building', 'was', 'constructed', 'using', 'novel', 'steel', 'load-bearing', 'frame.From', '1974', '2013', 'Willis', 'Tower', 'formerly', 'Sears', 'Tower', 'Chicago', 'was', 'tallest', 'skyscraper', 'United', 'States', 'Prior', 'September', '11', '2001', 'attacks', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'twin', 'towers', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'occupied', 'second', 'third', 'positions', 'tallest', 'buildings', 'U.S', 'are', 'only', 'buildings', 'would', 'have', 'qualified', 'list', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'standing', 'Chicago', 'New', 'York', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'centers', 'US', 'skyscraper', 'building', 'eight', 'tallest', 'buildings', 'US', 'are', 'either', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Chicago', 'top', 'twenty-five', 'buildings', 'eight', 'are', 'Chicago', 'seven', 'are', 'New', 'York', 'City.One', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'previously', 'known', 'Freedom', 'Tower', 'built', 'former', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'site', 'became', 'tallest', 'building', 'United', 'States', '2013', 'Chicago', 'Spire', 'previously', 'known', 'Fordham', 'Spire', 'was', 'construction', 'Chicago', 'been', 'cancelled', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tallest', 'building', 'United', 'States', 'rising', '2,000', 'ft', 'sky.Interesting', 'interview', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'who', 'wanted', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'claim', 'title', 'having', 'tallest', 'building', 'America', 'won', 'bet', 'building', ""'One"", 'World', 'Trade', ""Center'.This"", 'program', 'documents', 'development', 'Otis', 'Elevator', 'modern', 'air', 'conditioning', 'office', 'buildings', 'revolving', 'doors', ""'dampers"", 'keep', 'tall', 'buildings', 'violent', 'oscillating', 'heavy', 'wind', 'flow', 'even', 'New', 'York', 'architect', 'who', 'conceptualizing', '500-story', 'building', 'would', 'take', 'up', '16', 'city', 'blocks', 'rise', 'more', 'one', 'mile', 'air', 'would', 'be', 'amazing', 'Very', 'interesting', 'program', 'Not', 'be', 'missed', 'learned', 'lot', 'subject', 'matter', 'think', 'will', 'too', 'Really', 'glad', 'found', 'program', 'So', 'would', 'anyone', 'care', 'touch', 'clouds', '500-story', 'building', 'Might', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'high', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '..']",N/A

Inasmuch as it is thorough, it is somewhat outdated and only need be considered as reference material.  So much has evolved since the time in which this documentary was made that I would be amiss to point out the current trend of modern architecture and the current atmosphere in which builders have actually become developers in large scale projects like the new Hudson Yards in New York City.  This is the last so called undesired, underdeveloped and massive land grabs in the history of Manhattan Island.  It will forever change the skyline of New York City.
