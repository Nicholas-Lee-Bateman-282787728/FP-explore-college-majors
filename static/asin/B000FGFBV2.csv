The VH1 movie was better as it centered on Brian Wilson and his problems. This movie is centered on Dennis Wilson and his problems. As any Beach Boy fan knows, Brian was the genius behind the music. Dennis wasn't a real contributor to the music. He could barely play drums and wasn't much of a singer either.The VH1 movie was also more about the music! It showed how Brian was inspired by Phil Spector's Wall-Of-Sound production style and how Brian incorporated it to his own use starting with the album Pet Sounds.This movie is about Dennis and his rebel ways. The guy playing Charles Manson isn't even as good as the VH1 movie. This Manson looks like he's wearing a fake wig and beard (which he no doubt is).For some reason, I can't find a DVD version of the VH1 movie. I would love to have a copy of it. When it aired on VH1, I recorded it onto VHS but it has since been lost. Believe me. That was a much better version of the story of The Beach Boys.",4,"Good, but not the best!",1210032000,"05 6, 2008",2008,1076,"['When', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'VH1', 'original', 'movie', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'not', 'bad', 'VH1', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'centered', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'problems', 'movie', 'centered', 'Dennis', 'Wilson', 'problems', 'Beach', 'Boy', 'fan', 'knows', 'Brian', 'was', 'genius', 'music', 'Dennis', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'contributor', 'music', 'could', 'barely', 'play', 'drums', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'singer', 'either.The', 'VH1', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'more', 'music', 'showed', 'how', 'Brian', 'was', 'inspired', 'Phil', 'Spector', 'Wall-Of-Sound', 'production', 'style', 'how', 'Brian', 'incorporated', 'own', 'use', 'starting', 'album', 'Pet', 'Sounds.This', 'movie', 'Dennis', 'rebel', 'ways', 'guy', 'playing', 'Charles', 'Manson', ""n't"", 'even', 'as', 'good', 'VH1', 'movie', 'Manson', 'wearing', 'fake', 'wig', 'beard', 'doubt', '.For', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'DVD', 'version', 'VH1', 'movie', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'copy', 'When', 'aired', 'VH1', 'recorded', 'VHS', 'been', 'lost', 'Believe', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'version', 'story', 'Beach', 'Boys']",N/A

I have trouble being objective about them and their music.  I also have read, watched and studied many books, videos and articles about them over the last over 30 years.So, for me this movies was a must see based on all of that.  And I kind of liked it.  It is more from Dennis Wilson's point of view (or at least the writers and producers version of that) and therefore some of the other Beach Boys get short shrift.  Also, the music is NOT the Beach Boys performing, however, it is pretty good ( I think former Beach Boys band member and current Brian Wilson Band member, Jeffrey Foskett had something to do with it).As for the movie itself: it is dramatically at least a notch better than AN AMERICAN FAMILY, which suffers from classic ""Movie of the Week"" syndrome: campy overacting, some ridiculous conflation of parts of the history (this one has a lot of that also) and some stupid writing.  Truth is, I like both movies, God help me, because they tell the story, albeit very truncated and Hollywood versions of the story.If you are a true Beach Boys fan, and like me some what obsessive-compulsive and need to have everything by or about the Beach Boys, you will probably want this, if only to have fun putting it down.  IF you are someone who does not know much about the Beach Boys and wants to know more, I would go for the documentary ENDLESS HARMONY instead.  It too has its bias and flaws, but it features the real Beach Boys talking about their music and their life (and each other!), as well as some great rare performances and recordings.This is more of a dramatic ""shortcut"", that while not bad, is not great either.  It is entertaining though, and not expensive.",3,A brave attempt,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,1742,"['am', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'fan', 'Let', 'get', 'way', 'first', 'have', 'trouble', 'being', 'objective', 'music', 'also', 'have', 'read', 'watched', 'studied', 'many', 'books', 'videos', 'articles', 'last', '30', 'years.So', 'movies', 'was', 'must', 'see', 'based', 'kind', 'liked', 'more', 'Dennis', 'Wilson', 'point', 'view', 'least', 'writers', 'producers', 'version', 'therefore', 'other', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'get', 'short', 'shrift', 'Also', 'music', 'NOT', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'performing', 'however', 'pretty', 'good', 'think', 'former', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'band', 'member', 'current', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'Band', 'member', 'Jeffrey', 'Foskett', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'movie', 'dramatically', 'least', 'notch', 'better', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'FAMILY', 'classic', 'Movie', 'Week', 'syndrome', 'campy', 'overacting', 'ridiculous', 'conflation', 'parts', 'history', 'one', 'lot', 'also', 'stupid', 'writing', 'Truth', 'like', 'movies', 'God', 'help', 'tell', 'story', 'albeit', 'very', 'truncated', 'Hollywood', 'versions', 'story.If', 'are', 'true', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'fan', 'what', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'need', 'have', 'everything', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'only', 'have', 'fun', 'putting', 'down', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'know', 'more', 'would', 'go', 'documentary', 'ENDLESS', 'HARMONY', 'instead', 'too', 'bias', 'flaws', 'real', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'talking', 'music', 'life', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'rare', 'performances', 'recordings.This', 'more', 'dramatic', 'shortcut', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'either', 'entertaining', 'not', 'expensive']",N/A
