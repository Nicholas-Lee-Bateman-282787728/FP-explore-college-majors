The men all meet and talk (they are preparing a dinner), and the women all meet, too (in a gym). The movie is almost all talk as each person reveals his or her own story and feelings. They then all meet and talk some more, and some illusions are destroyed via certain betrayals. It's rare to see such a sophisticated film, though it's very stagey and not very dramatic. (At one point a man, not part of the group, says, ""All they do is talk about sex and then sit down to a fish dinner."") An interesting picture, though, for the most part.

I rented it because I'd heard such high praise for its sequel, ""The Barbarian Invasions,"" and thought it might be nice to have some background on the characters that continue on through that new film, which had just come out on video.  Gawd.  What a waste of time.  This is a tedious film, one that replies on the bluntest of ""arch"" dialog and most banal shock tactics, outlining the profoundly uninvolving sexual escapades of eight French-Canadian intellectuals, academic buddies and married couples who sleep with everything that moves and cheerfully cheat on one another, then kiss-and-tell about nearly every detail.  I'm sure that their unlikeability is intentional, but their cheaply outlined raffishness is not compelling enough to balance things out: they simply aren't interesting characters, and their affairs are tawdry and implausible.  It's just boring.  Plus, the token gay character is poorly realized and unfairly stereotyped -- he's as much of a skeeze as the hets, but portrayed with an extra gloss of condemnation, as if non-straight promiscuity were in and of itself more dangerous than the mindless, voracious immorality of the straight characters. (At the time, I guess, AIDS was still seen as a ""gay"" disease...)  Anyway, my wife walked away from this film after about forty minutes, a half-hour later, I joined her.  I doubt I'll follow up with watching the new film as well.",2,A dull French sex talkathon,1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,1508,"['Well', 'have', 'confess', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'make', 'way', 'film', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'rented', ""'d"", 'heard', 'such', 'high', 'praise', 'sequel', 'Barbarian', 'Invasions', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'background', 'characters', 'continue', 'new', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'come', 'out', 'video', 'Gawd', 'What', 'waste', 'time', 'tedious', 'film', 'one', 'bluntest', 'arch', 'dialog', 'most', 'banal', 'shock', 'tactics', 'outlining', 'profoundly', 'uninvolving', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'eight', 'French-Canadian', 'intellectuals', 'academic', 'buddies', 'married', 'couples', 'who', 'sleep', 'everything', 'cheerfully', 'cheat', 'one', 'then', 'kiss-and-tell', 'nearly', 'detail', ""'m"", 'sure', 'unlikeability', 'intentional', 'cheaply', 'outlined', 'raffishness', 'not', 'compelling', 'enough', 'balance', 'things', 'out', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'characters', 'affairs', 'are', 'tawdry', 'implausible', 'just', 'boring', 'token', 'gay', 'character', 'poorly', 'realized', 'unfairly', 'stereotyped', 'as', 'much', 'skeeze', 'hets', 'portrayed', 'extra', 'gloss', 'condemnation', 'non-straight', 'promiscuity', 'were', 'more', 'dangerous', 'mindless', 'voracious', 'immorality', 'straight', 'characters', 'time', 'guess', 'AIDS', 'was', 'still', 'seen', 'gay', 'disease', 'Anyway', 'wife', 'walked', 'away', 'film', 'forty', 'minutes', 'half-hour', 'later', 'joined', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'up', 'watching', 'new', 'film', 'as', 'well']",The Decline of the American Empire

That is, they are supremely narcissistic, enlessly self-obsessed, preening and cloying drama queens who are entertaining and stimulating in equal measure to being annoying and exasperating.Like other reviewers, I came upon this film after seeing its sequal, ""The Barbarian Invasions"" which while also very talky in a five-miles-wide-and-one-inch-deep manner, has more of an actual plot to speak of and therefore is a much more effective film that doesn't test your patience quite as much.The sexual dialogue is often very witty, amusing, refreshingly candid and non-PC, at times even insightful.  French-Canadian academics seem to have far richer sex lives than their American counterparts, that's for sure.  Surprising because I thought the whole PC crapola was equally if not more pervasive up north...it must be the European influence and lack of puritannical Christianity that we still suffer from.One sidenote: are all French-Canadian men THIS hopelessly dorky-looking?  Why are all the characters so badly dressed, is this film supposed to be set in the 1970s?  Weird, I always thought French people were supposedly good-looking and stylish, or is that French-French only, not the Canadian variety?

838682,A14Q6R4481YFFG,B0002KPI3M,Hinkle Goldfarb,"[0, 0]","""Decline of the American Empire"" is a difficult movie to define, mainly because it straddles both European and New World cinematographic tendencies (i.e., ponderous and talky on the one hand, ponderous and talky about sex on the other).  Briefly, it's the story of four or five friends who, with one exception, discover that their relationships are in decline -- disintegrating because they come to know more and more about themselves and their lovers.  Is it supposed to be some complex metaphor that somehow ties back in to the movie's title?  That's never really clarified.  But the dialogue is fun (Quebecois French, English subtitles), and the characters aren't sympathetic enough to make you feel sorry for them, so you can, in a detached way, enjoy their suffering in this offbeat comedy drama farce.",4,"Fun, uneven, choppy",1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,807,"['Decline', 'American', 'Empire', 'difficult', 'movie', 'define', 'mainly', 'European', 'New', 'World', 'cinematographic', 'tendencies', 'i.e.', 'ponderous', 'talky', 'one', 'hand', 'ponderous', 'talky', 'sex', 'other', 'Briefly', 'story', 'four', 'five', 'friends', 'who', 'one', 'exception', 'discover', 'relationships', 'are', 'decline', 'disintegrating', 'come', 'know', 'more', 'more', 'lovers', 'supposed', 'be', 'complex', 'metaphor', 'somehow', 'back', 'movie', 'title', 'never', 'really', 'clarified', 'dialogue', 'fun', 'Quebecois', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'sympathetic', 'enough', 'make', 'feel', 'sorry', 'can', 'detached', 'way', 'enjoy', 'suffering', 'offbeat', 'comedy', 'drama', 'farce']",The Decline of the American Empire

However, I make it a habit to watch as many of the Best Foreign Language Oscar nominees as I can and this is one of them.  I was also put off by a French movie with such a title until I realized that this is a French Canadian movie.  Well, THEY certainly have a right to their opinion on the subject.It didn't take long before I was seeing (and hearing and reading) what the reviewers were talking about.  The movie goes back and forth between the women at the gym and the men at the house.  (That was an interesting touch; the women were working out and the men were home preparing the meal).  With each segment we hear the men and women talking about their sexual escapades; past and present.  The bragging, and laughing, and more lets us know that these are friends who enjoy each other's company.  It gives us a sense of being in a comfort zone of often uncomfortable converation.  In time, after we already know who did what with whom, the groups get together at their planned get together.  The subject remains the same but the tone is a bit different.  Eventually, after too much bold talk fueled, in part, by too much alcohol, someone goes a step too far and the cameraderie is altered.There comes a point when the movie's title is discussed.  By that time, we have seen enough of what should be the real underlying  meaning of the title.  The joke is on the participants who fancy themselves as intellectuals because they are college professors.  The lack of any real commitment shows the fragility of the relationship involved; the long-term ones, the recent romances, and the possibilities that are just coming to light.  One senses that, after a night of encountering their shallowness, they'll readily return to their definition of normal.",3,The Decline of the American Morality,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,1876,"['glanced', 'reviews', 'watched', 'film', 'found', 'helpful', 'almost', 'made', 'skip', 'movie', 'However', 'make', 'habit', 'watch', 'many', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Oscar', 'can', 'one', 'was', 'also', 'put', 'off', 'French', 'movie', 'title', 'realized', 'French', 'Canadian', 'movie', 'Well', 'THEY', 'certainly', 'have', 'right', 'opinion', 'subject.It', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'was', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'reading', 'what', 'reviewers', 'were', 'talking', 'about', 'movie', 'back', 'forth', 'women', 'gym', 'men', 'house', 'was', 'interesting', 'touch', 'women', 'were', 'working', 'out', 'men', 'were', 'home', 'preparing', 'meal', 'segment', 'hear', 'men', 'women', 'talking', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'past', 'present', 'bragging', 'laughing', 'more', 'lets', 'know', 'are', 'friends', 'who', 'enjoy', 'other', 'company', 'sense', 'being', 'comfort', 'zone', 'often', 'uncomfortable', 'converation', 'time', 'already', 'know', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'whom', 'groups', 'get', 'together', 'planned', 'get', 'together', 'subject', 'same', 'tone', 'bit', 'different', 'Eventually', 'too', 'much', 'bold', 'talk', 'fueled', 'part', 'too', 'much', 'alcohol', 'someone', 'step', 'too', 'far', 'cameraderie', 'altered.There', 'point', 'when', 'movie', 'title', 'discussed', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'enough', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'real', 'underlying', 'meaning', 'title', 'joke', 'participants', 'who', 'fancy', 'intellectuals', 'are', 'college', 'professors', 'lack', 'real', 'commitment', 'fragility', 'relationship', 'involved', 'long-term', 'ones', 'recent', 'romances', 'possibilities', 'are', 'just', 'coming', 'light', 'One', 'night', 'encountering', 'shallowness', ""'ll"", 'readily', 'return', 'definition', 'normal']",The Decline of the American Empire
