In our skeptical age in which everything is doubted, director Agnieszka Holland has created an engrossing, tightly-composed work that questions our skepticism and looks squarely at issues of religious faith and belief in the contemporary world. Other reviewers have recounted the movie story line and commented on the superb performances of Ed Harris, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Anne Heche. What, perhaps, has not been fully addressed is just what is the &quot;third miracle&quot; and the meaning of the abrupt conclusion of the film. Here the lines of Ed Harris (Fr. Shore) are key: &quot;God wastes no miracles.&quot; Indeed, is not the final scene of the movie, itself, a representation of that so greatly desired &quot;third miracle&quot;? Is not the fact that once-doubting Fr. Shore is now a parish priest who's recovered his faith and that the Anne Heche character is now happily married (with a child) a &quot;miracle&quot;? Is this not what Holland is saying? THOSE miracles were deeply personal, perhaps not something for the special pontifical commission, but &quot;miracles&quot; nevertheless, and ones which transform the lives of two people.Thus, with understatement and eloquence &quot;The Third Miracle&quot; concludes, hauntingly.",5,A haunting film...,1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,1349,"['quot', 'Third', 'Miracle', 'quot', 'fascinating', 'little', 'movie', 'more', 'familiarity', 'viewers', 'skeptical', 'age', 'everything', 'doubted', 'director', 'Agnieszka', 'Holland', 'created', 'engrossing', 'tightly-composed', 'work', 'questions', 'skepticism', 'squarely', 'issues', 'religious', 'faith', 'belief', 'contemporary', 'world', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'recounted', 'movie', 'story', 'line', 'commented', 'superb', 'performances', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'What', 'perhaps', 'not', 'been', 'fully', 'addressed', 'just', 'what', 'quot', 'third', 'miracle', 'quot', 'meaning', 'abrupt', 'conclusion', 'film', 'Here', 'lines', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Fr', 'Shore', 'are', 'key', 'quot', 'God', 'miracles.', 'quot', 'Indeed', 'not', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'representation', 'so', 'greatly', 'desired', 'quot', 'third', 'miracle', 'quot', 'not', 'fact', 'once-doubting', 'Fr', 'Shore', 'now', 'parish', 'priest', 'who', 'recovered', 'faith', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'character', 'now', 'happily', 'married', 'child', 'quot', 'miracle', 'quot', 'not', 'what', 'Holland', 'saying', 'THOSE', 'miracles', 'were', 'deeply', 'personal', 'perhaps', 'not', 'something', 'special', 'pontifical', 'commission', 'quot', 'miracles', 'quot', 'ones', 'transform', 'lives', 'two', 'people.Thus', 'understatement', 'eloquence', 'quot', 'Third', 'Miracle', 'quot', 'concludes', 'hauntingly']",N/A

He is now given the task of investigating the life of a devout Catholic woman whose death has  seemingly been followed by miracles that include a bleeding statute.  Actually the Bishop is relying on Father Shore's reputation as a miracle  killer, hoping that he will find evidence to scuttle Helen O'Regan's bid  for sainthood. Mrs. O'Regan's daughter does not support the cause, and in  due time she and Father Shore develop a romantic interest in each other.  Fortunately this part of the plot does not intrude unduly into the process  of investigating the case.What is strange about this movie is the  pre-eminence given to the assessment of miracles. Little time seems to be  spent on examining the life of the woman being considered for possible  sainthood. Other than the issue of her possible abandonment of her  daughter, we are presented only with a few comments about her work with  parish children, and a glimpse of the humble room in which she lived. A  brief video of her playing with the kiddies seems sufficient to pass  judgment on her life. One would assume that every facet of her life would  be examined in order to properly assess whether she lived a life of  &quot;heroic virtue.&quot; Instead most everything focuses on the  miracles.The movie also portrays a view of the bureaucracy of the  church. The diocesan offices rival those of an uptown law firm. We see the  luxury of an in-office bar; the fine, regal apparel of the bishops and  cardinals; the limousine; the luxurious bedroom suite; the short temper  when dealing with underlings. All these are presented to impress on us the  elaborate structure humans have built around the simple beliefs of a humble  carpenter. Perhaps, the movie would seem to say, the simple life of a  devout woman is more what Jesus had in mind when he preached his gospel.",4,More To It Than Miracles,964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,1955,"['Father', 'Frank', 'Shore', 'priest', 'who', 'experiencing', 'dark', 'time', 'soul', 'when', 'religious', 'belief', 'very', 'fragile', 'now', 'given', 'task', 'investigating', 'life', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'woman', 'death', 'seemingly', 'been', 'followed', 'miracles', 'include', 'bleeding', 'statute', 'Actually', 'Bishop', 'relying', 'Father', 'Shore', 'reputation', 'miracle', 'killer', 'hoping', 'will', 'find', 'evidence', 'scuttle', 'Helen', ""O'Regan"", 'bid', 'sainthood', 'Mrs.', ""O'Regan"", 'daughter', 'not', 'support', 'cause', 'due', 'time', 'Father', 'Shore', 'develop', 'romantic', 'interest', 'other', 'Fortunately', 'part', 'plot', 'not', 'intrude', 'unduly', 'process', 'investigating', 'case.What', 'strange', 'movie', 'pre-eminence', 'given', 'assessment', 'miracles', 'Little', 'time', 'be', 'spent', 'examining', 'life', 'woman', 'being', 'considered', 'possible', 'sainthood', 'Other', 'issue', 'possible', 'abandonment', 'daughter', 'are', 'presented', 'only', 'few', 'comments', 'work', 'parish', 'children', 'glimpse', 'humble', 'room', 'lived', 'brief', 'video', 'playing', 'kiddies', 'sufficient', 'pass', 'judgment', 'life', 'One', 'would', 'assume', 'facet', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'examined', 'order', 'properly', 'assess', 'lived', 'life', 'quot', 'virtue.', 'quot', 'Instead', 'most', 'everything', 'focuses', 'miracles.The', 'movie', 'also', 'view', 'bureaucracy', 'church', 'diocesan', 'offices', 'rival', 'uptown', 'law', 'firm', 'see', 'luxury', 'in-office', 'bar', 'fine', 'regal', 'apparel', 'bishops', 'cardinals', 'limousine', 'luxurious', 'bedroom', 'suite', 'short', 'temper', 'when', 'dealing', 'underlings', 'are', 'presented', 'impress', 'elaborate', 'structure', 'humans', 'have', 'built', 'simple', 'beliefs', 'humble', 'carpenter', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'would', 'seem', 'say', 'simple', 'life', 'devout', 'woman', 'more', 'what', 'Jesus', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'preached', 'gospel']",N/A

This movie is very interesting as it deals with a main theme and some derivations of it: do exists the saints truly? There are people capable to do miracles? And if yes: are a saint those people we usually know as a good person in ordinary life?For me, the film answers yes, there are saints around us, but... they are worrying, preoccupant people, as they don't observe a regular way of life. And this is so for ordinary people but also for official Church, in this case Catholic.In effect, it's said a woman has detained a bombardment over Central Europe during WW II. She emigrates later to the USA and she is responsible of one or two unexplainable healings, but she abandons his family. Father Frank Shore is in charge to investigate the truth of these facts, but summing up, modern consumer society isn't the best environment for saints and miracles, and Shore is plenty of doubts about his own faith. He's too much humane and so, likes to drink and likes women. Devil's advocate comes from Europe: he's a German cardinal, a cultivated and elitist intellectual, but over all, he conserves in his memory things nobody knows excepting himself, but the case is as he says. ""these miracles aren't convenient for  the Catholic Church"" Today we have times to be reasonable, miracles are bad to reveal to the public.

Then his mouth dropping open, with a very appropriate rejoinder of ""Oh, my God!""

I also know that non Catholics and non Christians don't understand it and may even think that the Church arbitrarily elevates anyone it wants to Sainthoood.  This film, ""The Third Miracle"", does a fairly good job exploring the canonization process in a feature film.  Granted, times and themes have changed since ""The Song Of Bernadette"" won the Best Film Oscar in 1944 exploring the ""Marian Miracle"" theme, but it is reassuring that this type of screenplay still makes for a moving and haunting film.  Sadly, the film did not get a lot of promotion or ballyoo even though it was marvelously produced, had high production values and featured superb performances by Ed Harris, Anne Heche and a host of other notable supportng players.  Ed Harris is truly one of the screens most riveting actors and even his smaller screen parts are unforgettable for their realism, intensity and strength.  Anne Heche is perfect as the wayward, doubting daughter especially in her meetings with Father Shore.My only criticisms, and they are mild, involve the smoking, drinking clergy portrayed and their seeming love of socializing and the ""good life"".  Also, the ending was too unexplained and it left you somewhat dangling as to how Roxanne acquired her child.  Was she married?  To whom? Was the child adopted?  Where was the husband?  It would seem that Father Shore and Roxanne would have had something more profound to say to one another after such an emotional and harrowing experience.In summation, many believers and non believers, those of strong faith and those who have doubts about their beliefs, will take something different away from this film.  I would only add that we will never understand God's ways.  To those who believe no proof is necessary.  To those who don't, all the proof in the world is irrelevant.Dick Bobnick",5,"Yes, miracles do happen!",1042243200,"01 11, 2003",2003,1970,"['am', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'understand', 'whole', 'lengthy', 'deeply', 'exhausting', 'investigative', 'process', 'surrounding', 'beatification', 'canonization', 'also', 'know', 'non', 'Catholics', 'non', 'Christians', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'may', 'even', 'think', 'Church', 'arbitrarily', 'anyone', 'Sainthoood', 'film', 'Third', 'Miracle', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'exploring', 'canonization', 'process', 'feature', 'film', 'Granted', 'times', 'themes', 'have', 'changed', 'Song', 'Bernadette', 'won', 'Best', 'Film', 'Oscar', '1944', 'exploring', 'Marian', 'Miracle', 'theme', 'reassuring', 'type', 'screenplay', 'still', 'moving', 'haunting', 'film', 'Sadly', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'lot', 'promotion', 'ballyoo', 'even', 'was', 'marvelously', 'produced', 'had', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'featured', 'superb', 'performances', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'host', 'other', 'notable', 'supportng', 'players', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'truly', 'one', 'screens', 'most', 'riveting', 'actors', 'even', 'smaller', 'screen', 'parts', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'realism', 'intensity', 'strength', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'perfect', 'wayward', 'doubting', 'daughter', 'especially', 'meetings', 'Father', 'Shore.My', 'only', 'are', 'mild', 'involve', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'clergy', 'portrayed', 'seeming', 'love', 'socializing', 'good', 'life', 'Also', 'ending', 'was', 'too', 'unexplained', 'left', 'somewhat', 'dangling', 'how', 'Roxanne', 'acquired', 'child', 'Was', 'married', 'whom', 'Was', 'child', 'adopted', 'Where', 'was', 'husband', 'would', 'seem', 'Father', 'Shore', 'Roxanne', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'more', 'profound', 'say', 'one', 'emotional', 'harrowing', 'experience.In', 'summation', 'many', 'believers', 'non', 'believers', 'strong', 'faith', 'who', 'have', 'doubts', 'beliefs', 'will', 'take', 'something', 'different', 'away', 'film', 'would', 'only', 'add', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'God', 'ways', 'who', 'believe', 'proof', 'necessary', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'proof', 'world', 'irrelevant.Dick', 'Bobnick']",N/A

I've seen at least some of the more popular work she's produced, &quot;Europa, Europa,&quot; &quot;The Secret Garden.&quot;  What--if anything--they have in common, I  may have to leave up to future scholars to tell me.  Well, I can say this  much, her films are certainly provocative, regardless of how well or poorly  they otherwise hang together as an oeuvre.&quot;The Third Miracle&quot;  is a remarkable film. Well worth viewing and then viewing again.  Its  treatment of the meaning of the miraculous in these post-modern times is  neither heavy handed nor overly cynical.  Much of the credit goes to a  solid cast, including Ed Harris in his best role in years and Anne Heche.  German actress Barbara Sukowa appears in flashback and Hill Street alumnus  Charles Haid pops up as a skeptical cardinal who's all business.

Watching this film I got the definite impression that the writer and possibly the director have a love/hate  relationship with the grand old institution. The movie examines in depth  the contradictary state of affairs in which the Catholic Church is an  unofficial nation/goverment within an established nation, very much of this  world, and at the same time a source of faith and inpiration to millions by  following the investigation of possible miracles done in the name of a  simple German woman who is now dead. In Ed Harris's character we witness  the struggle between his desire to believe in god, the miracles , regaining  his faith and his attraction to the dead woman's daughter. He's desperate  to believe, but he wants also to have more from the physical world. All in  all I have to give this movie high marks. It's suspenseful, thoughtful,  intruiging, well acted and smartly directed. You care for the characters  and those who are not as attractive you come to understand if not  sympathise with.

Yes, the plot can easily be stated, but behind the simple story are so many thought provoking ideas and images that it becomes a multi-layered experience. To tell the details of the plot (and many very amateurish ""reviewers"" take delight in doing this when the first rule of a good review is to NOT tell the story!!!)negates the real impact of the film. The plot can seem trite, but the way it is acted, the way the scenes are presented and the wonderfully sublte touches make this film one that can be viewed over and over with new meanings coming each time.I do admit that it will have the biggest impact on someone who knows and believes in the Roman Catholic Church.The casting is wonderful. Ed Harris should have received multiple awards for this film. Anne Heche is a revelation. I had never thought of her as a real actress but more of a publicity icon. This film proved that she has a depth and technique that belong to fine actors.For those looking for the ""third miracle"", it is stated in the last scenes that the third has not yet happened. The viewer can make up their own mind as to that miracle. In the director's comment track, she says that a number of endings were tried, but only the one used came close to being right.For me, the third miracle is that of Faith.

549694,A332MW6OA1LYDF,B00004STD8,John Noodles,"[15, 18]","The Third Miracle is a good movie with rousing performances that, sadly, falls into the same old Catholics-in-movies traps that so many others have fallen in before them.Ed Harris is fine as Fr. Frank Shores, a priest  who devotes himself to researching miracles for the Church.  At the  beginning of the movie, he is &quot;in hiding,&quot; living in a flophouse,  having either lost his faith or moved in that direction with greateer  momentum as a result of a previous investigation of a miracle that  he...misjudged?  We don't really know.  He clearly regrets his decision,  but the priest whom he was investigating died under dubious circumstance,  and left behind some documents that can most generously be called  &quot;curious.&quot;  Fr. Shores' decision seems like the only reasonable  one. Still, he tortures himself for having destroyed a community's  faith.Shores' new assignment is to investigate an immigrant  &quot;housewife saint,&quot; who lived in a Polish-Catholic Chicago ghetto.  Years earlier, a little girl with a terminal blood disease prayed to the  church's statue of Mary, which bled on her; the girl was immediately cured.  The blood, parishioners believe, is the blood of the housewife saint.Anne Heche's character plays an important role in this movie, but is  sadly misused.  She is not only the daughter the housewife saint left in  order to &quot;pay her debt to God,&quot; she becomes Fr. Shores'  predictably ultra-perky love interest.  Yes, THAT old chestnut!  Curiously,  the filmmaker stops short of having them actually go to bed together...they  just kiss, pant, and grope.  There seems little reason for so explicitly  revealing an attraction between the two, when actors as capable as they are  could certainly convey this without the histrionics--in this case, less  would have been more.Armin Mueller-Stahl is perfect as the tribunal  naysayer.  He steals the scenes he's in.  His resistance to Shores'  housewife saint is only superficially convincing, and the scene in which he  reveals it remains unconvincing--not because of the actors, but because it  is poorly scripted.Still, the movie is worth a look.  The plot is  tight, the performances moving.

549695,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00004STD8,Joseph Haschka,"[58, 60]","THE THIRD MIRACLE opens with an Allied air raid on a Czech town late in  WW II. The sequence focuses on a little girl praying as the bombs fall, and on a wounded German soldier who sees her and the pigeons.Fast forward to 1979 in Chicago. Father Frank Shore, played by Ed Harris, is a Roman Catholic priest undergoing a crisis of faith regarding his God, his Church, and his role as a cleric. Yet, he's also the diocesan postulator, i.e. the priest who investigates the life of any individual being popularly acclaimed for sainthood, and who makes a subsequent recommendation (thumbs up or down) to the bishop preparatory to the possible involvement of Rome. Fr. Frank is known as ""The Miracle Killer"" for his previous work debunking potential sainthood. Thus, the bishop tasks him with scrutinizing the life of one Helen O'Regan, who is, after her death, being proclaimed a saint by the members of a local parish at which she worked. Ostensible evidence for her special relationship with the Lord is the blood that drips from the eyes of a parish statue of the Virgin Mary during November when it rains. (Helen died in November during a rainstorm.) One miracle has already been reported, the complete cure of a little girl with fatal lupus erythematosis, Maria Witkowski, after she comes into contact with the blood while praying to Helen at the foot of the statue.This is more a story of Shore's search for renewed faith than that of O'Regan's possible eligibility for sainthood, though the latter serves as the vehicle for the former. Shore is desperate to revitalize his life, and seems ripe to do so with Helen's daughter Roxanne, vivaciously played by Anne Heche. The scene between the two on Helen's grave is positively effervescent. Will Frank compromise his priestly vow of celibacy?As the probe into the reported miracle and Helen's life continues, Shore comes into conflict with Archbishop Werner, played by Armin Mueller-Stahl, an arrogant, contemptuous, German prelate who believes that America doesn't need another saint, or at least one whose elevation is predicated on such evidence as presented in the O'Regan case. Werner is a member of a tribunal sent by the Vatican to hear that evidence, during which process miracle #2 occurs, again involving Maria. Even then, Werner's adamant opposition is not softened.All actors in this film are splendid, especially Ed Harris, whose Fr. Frank is likely to be an enormously sympathetic character, especially with Roman Catholics, who are well acquainted with priests, bishops, saints, and the concept of miracles.  I would even go so far as to say that only a Catholic could appreciate this movie. Those of other faiths might consider it a fairy tale about superstitious nonsense.  Be that as it may, the film's ""gotcha"" is the plot twist surrounding THE THIRD MIRACLE.  For Catholics, the film is a must-see, along with those gems from the past, CATHOLICS and AGNES OF GOD. All three serve to remind that, in the Age of Science, Faith cannot be absent.",4,The unsuspected healing properties of Group A blood,981936000,"02 12, 2001",2001,3012,"['THIRD', 'MIRACLE', 'Allied', 'air', 'raid', 'Czech', 'town', 'late', 'WW', 'II', 'sequence', 'little', 'girl', 'praying', 'bombs', 'fall', 'wounded', 'German', 'soldier', 'who', 'pigeons.Fast', 'forward', '1979', 'Chicago', 'Father', 'Frank', 'Shore', 'played', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'undergoing', 'crisis', 'faith', 'regarding', 'God', 'Church', 'role', 'cleric', 'also', 'diocesan', 'postulator', 'i.e', 'priest', 'who', 'life', 'individual', 'being', 'popularly', 'acclaimed', 'sainthood', 'who', 'subsequent', 'recommendation', 'thumbs', 'up', 'down', 'bishop', 'preparatory', 'possible', 'involvement', 'Rome', 'Fr', 'Frank', 'known', 'Miracle', 'Killer', 'previous', 'work', 'debunking', 'potential', 'sainthood', 'Thus', 'bishop', 'scrutinizing', 'life', 'one', 'Helen', ""O'Regan"", 'who', 'death', 'being', 'proclaimed', 'saint', 'members', 'local', 'parish', 'worked', 'Ostensible', 'evidence', 'special', 'relationship', 'Lord', 'blood', 'eyes', 'parish', 'statue', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'November', 'when', 'Helen', 'died', 'November', 'rainstorm', 'One', 'miracle', 'already', 'been', 'reported', 'complete', 'cure', 'little', 'girl', 'fatal', 'lupus', 'erythematosis', 'Maria', 'Witkowski', 'contact', 'blood', 'praying', 'Helen', 'foot', 'statue.This', 'more', 'story', 'Shore', 'search', 'renewed', 'faith', ""O'Regan"", 'possible', 'eligibility', 'sainthood', 'latter', 'serves', 'vehicle', 'former', 'Shore', 'desperate', 'revitalize', 'life', 'ripe', 'do', 'so', 'Helen', 'daughter', 'Roxanne', 'vivaciously', 'played', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'scene', 'two', 'Helen', 'grave', 'positively', 'effervescent', 'Will', 'Frank', 'compromise', 'priestly', 'vow', 'celibacy', 'probe', 'reported', 'miracle', 'Helen', 'life', 'Shore', 'conflict', 'Archbishop', 'Werner', 'played', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'arrogant', 'contemptuous', 'German', 'prelate', 'who', 'America', ""n't"", 'need', 'saint', 'least', 'one', 'elevation', 'predicated', 'such', 'evidence', 'presented', ""O'Regan"", 'case', 'Werner', 'member', 'tribunal', 'sent', 'Vatican', 'hear', 'evidence', 'process', 'miracle', '2', 'occurs', 'again', 'involving', 'Maria', 'Even', 'then', 'Werner', 'adamant', 'opposition', 'not', 'softened.All', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'splendid', 'especially', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Fr', 'Frank', 'likely', 'be', 'enormously', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'especially', 'Roman', 'Catholics', 'who', 'are', 'well', 'acquainted', 'priests', 'bishops', 'saints', 'concept', 'miracles', 'would', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'only', 'Catholic', 'could', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'other', 'faiths', 'might', 'consider', 'fairy', 'tale', 'superstitious', 'nonsense', 'Be', 'may', 'film', 'gotcha', 'plot', 'twist', 'surrounding', 'THE', 'THIRD', 'MIRACLE', 'Catholics', 'film', 'must-see', 'gems', 'past', 'CATHOLICS', 'AGNES', 'OF', 'GOD', 'three', 'serve', 'remind', 'Age', 'Science', 'Faith', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'absent']",N/A
549696,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00004STD8,Lee Armstrong,"[8, 21]","The performances of this film are excellent.  Ed Harris hits such diverse levels as the Catholic priest questioning his faith.  Anne Heche has nice orange hair, deep blue eyes, and looks marvelous.  The cinematography is excellent with the darker interior scenes and the flashbacks with their blue tones.  The DVD does not offer a lot of extra materials unless you'd like to have language subtitles.Two things about this picture bothered me.  The first is the attack on the Catholic church.  One person commented that this is the church that ""exonerates pedofiles and questions miracles.""  However, I think one must distinguish between the group religion and real religion which is personal and lives within the individual believer.  Harris does a masterful job of showing this conflict.  But it is the group attack that turned me off.  The film's point of view seems to assume that the group should work with the speed of the individual.  The velocities are quite different; so I found this an unaffair attack upon an easy target.The second problem I had was that the film didn't seem to go anywhere.  For me, the film fizzles at the end.  We go for a long time on the story then hit the ""1 year later"" cut and finally the ""3 years later"" cut.  This seemed to mute the ending rather than build to one.  This was not an episodic tale; so a climax would have been nice.  Of all the Amazon reviewers, I guess I'm the only one who wondered if that was the priest's baby that Heche brings in the last scene.  It would have been more interesting if she'd said something like, ""She has your eyes.""Although this film doesn't quite work, it's still interesting enough to spend some time with.

Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""","[9, 12]","Father Frank Shore became a priest after promising God that he would do so if his policeman fathersurvived a near fatal shooting.  But he seems to have always been at least somewhat skeptical about thewhole deal.  When we are introduced to him in the film he has gone well beyond simple skepticismand is living in an inner city Chicago flophouse, openly doubting his calling.  But the local bishop hasneed of his services, however reluctant, because Frank serves as a postulator, investigating allegedmiracles and potential saints, and at the moment strong claims are being put forward for thebeatification of an immigrant woman named Helen O'Regan.O'Regan has been dead for several years but on the day of her memorial service a young girl who shehad befriended entered the church covered in blood which had dripped from the eyes of a statue as sheprayed to or for Helen.  The event would be remarkable enough in its own right, but even morestartling is the fact that it cured the child of lupus.  Since that time parishioners have come to believethat the statue, which performs similarly during rainstorms every November (the month of Helen'sdeath), has healing powers and that Helen was a saint.Frank has earned a reputation as a debunker of such claims, and with it the nickname &quot;The MiracleKiller&quot;, but his most recent effort precipitated his downward spiral.  In that case Frank himself feltintimations of the divine and even witnessed a miraculous cure, but he ultimately disproved the virtueof the cleric involved.  His crisis of conscience resulted from the knowledge that he had destroyedpeoples faith in something tangible, even if extrareligious, in the service of a Church and a God that heis not certain he truly believes in.  Now he wants &quot;God to show his face&quot;, in order that he may believethat it has all been worthwhile.  And so he heads off to St. Stanislaus with a doubting mind but anopen heart.  Everything that he finds there gives him reason to believe in Helen O'Reagan.This portion of the movie is very much a classic detective story, a kind of Catholic hard-boiled noir,with Frank as the gumshoe.  The main complication that Frank faces in this phase of the case is anattraction to the daughter Helen pretty much abandoned when she entered the church.  That daughter,Roxanne (Ann Heche), sixteen at the time but now grown, is naturally resentful and baffled by thenotion that her mother might become just the fourth American saint.  Given the conventions ofHollywood this love interest is probably inevitable and it is handled as well as could possibly beexpected, but it would be a better film without it.In the second half of the movie, which becomes a courtroom melodrama, Frank has to defend the casefor Helen's sainthood against an extremely hostile and Ameriphobic devil's advocate, an Archbishop(played by Armin Mueller-Stahl) who is visiting from Rome.  Frank's own wavering faith becomes anissue in the hearing, but so too does the Archbishop's personal unwillingness to grant the possibilitythat an uncultured American immigrant woman could be a vessel of God.Director Agnieskia Holland is not quite at top form here, at least not at the peak level she reached inEuropa, Europa and The Secret Garden, but she never stoops to condescend to this material, which ispretty unusual in the modern cinema.  There are some characterizations that are a tad too hackneyedand some of the shots at the Catholic Church are too easy, too cheap, to be taken seriously; but eventhe villains, all clerics, of the piece ultimately prove to have more complex motivations than we firstbelieve.  Meanwhile, there are some really fine set pieces, particularly the discussions between Frankand his colleagues, where faith is taken seriously and discussed with passion, insight, and altogetherappropriate awe.Now, for each of these essays I try to find all the links I can to other reviews that are available online.In doing so for this movie I was first amused then angered by the frequency with which the followingsentiment cropped up : this is yet another film about a priest wrestling with his faith.  Yet another?Hold back the deluge!This is not to say that the central dilemma here is unique; it is not.  It treads some of the groundcovered by The Exorcist, which despite its reputation as a mere horror film is a compelling depictionof a priest's struggle to believe, but it does so without all the special effects, profanity, and othershockers and its particular concerns are very different.  I guess it is also somewhat similar to Stigmatawhich was unfortunately released at roughly the same time.  But so what?  If Silence of the Lambsdidn't exhaust the topic of serial killers and Porky's didn't obviate the need for inane scatological teencomedies, a bare handful of films sure as Hell didn't dispose of the questions surrounding belief inGod.  The winner of the Academy Award in 2000, which I think is when Third Miracle would havebeen eligible, was American Beauty.  Did we really need yet another look at the desperation of thesuburbs and the dysfunctioning family?  The answer is : if the film is good, by all means, another lookis fine.  But the same goes for The Third Miracle and the subjects it deals with.I don't know; maybe the questions raised in the Third Miracle just resonate with me because I'vereached a certain age and temperament, but I find the problem of faith to be quite fascinating.  How,in an Age of Reason and of Skepticism, can we believe in a God who no longer chooses to revealhimself to us through prophets, messiahs, and miracles?  Personally, I find the intellectual case forGod to be compelling, but a miracle would sure close the deal.  At any rate, if your mind is so closedthat you can not allow for the possibility of God or the miraculous, or if you think the seriousexploration of religious faith has become as ubiquitous as the car chase in recent movies, by all means,skip this one.  But if you appreciate great acting (Ed Harris is especially good) and beautiful filmmaking, and you're still curious about why we do or don't choose to believe in God, then you owe it toyourself to watch The Third Miracle.GRADE : B+",4,praying for a miracle,1005436800,"11 11, 2001",2001,6201,"['Father', 'Frank', 'Shore', 'became', 'priest', 'promising', 'God', 'would', 'do', 'so', 'policeman',
