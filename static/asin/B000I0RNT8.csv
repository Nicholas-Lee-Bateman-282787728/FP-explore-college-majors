1017913,A26MVLLMLG3Q8B,B000I0RNT8,"Avid Reader ""Karen""","[0, 0]","This DVD is a good mix of traditional ab exercises and Pilates moves. Although I enjoy this work out and I think it works the entire core, I didn't find it to be too challenging. This would be good for a beginner or a low intermediate exerciser.Workout: There is a long warm up (11 minutes) which includes squats, twists, shot puts, hammer throws, etc. which is a typical warm up for Gilad. The main work out is done all on the floor and it includes standard ab exercises such as variations on crunches with twists, scissors as well as Pilates exercises such as single leg stretch, roll ups, supermans, side leg lifts, planks, saw, etc.. There are a few stretching breaks in the 46 minute workout.Setting: The DVD is set on a beautiful beach in Hawaii with the ocean in view.Music: Typical of Gilad's shows, the music is instrumental and is just background music.Crew: There are 4 people(3 women and Arthur) working out with Gilad who are always demonstrating perfect form.Equipment Needed: 1 light dumbbellInstructor: Gilad is pleasant and encouraging without being annoying. He cues well and explains proper form in an easy to understand way.My only complaint with this work out is that I did not have to struggle to finish the work out the first time.",3,Works the entire core,1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,1254,"['DVD', 'good', 'mix', 'traditional', 'ab', 'exercises', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'enjoy', 'work', 'out', 'think', 'entire', 'core', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'too', 'challenging', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'beginner', 'low', 'intermediate', 'exerciser.Workout', 'long', 'warm', 'up', '11', 'minutes', 'squats', 'twists', 'shot', 'puts', 'hammer', 'throws', 'etc', 'typical', 'warm', 'up', 'Gilad', 'main', 'work', 'out', 'done', 'floor', 'standard', 'ab', 'exercises', 'such', 'variations', 'crunches', 'twists', 'scissors', 'as', 'well', 'Pilates', 'exercises', 'such', 'single', 'leg', 'stretch', 'roll', 'ups', 'supermans', 'side', 'leg', 'lifts', 'planks', 'saw', 'etc..', 'are', 'few', 'stretching', 'breaks', '46', 'minute', 'workout.Setting', 'DVD', 'set', 'beautiful', 'beach', 'Hawaii', 'ocean', 'view.Music', 'Typical', 'Gilad', 'shows', 'music', 'instrumental', 'just', 'background', 'music.Crew', 'are', '4', 'people', '3', 'women', 'Arthur', 'working', 'out', 'Gilad', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'demonstrating', 'perfect', 'form.Equipment', 'Needed', '1', 'light', 'dumbbellInstructor', 'Gilad', 'pleasant', 'encouraging', 'being', 'annoying', 'well', 'proper', 'form', 'easy', 'understand', 'way.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'work', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'struggle', 'finish', 'work', 'first', 'time']",Gilad: Ultimate Body Sculpt Series - Core and More

1017917,A3NZVCL9N8CLHB,B000I0RNT8,"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True""","[3, 6]","The workout was challenging, but lacked intensity. It seemed slow-paced and built up too much. I prefer my workouts to be fast-paced. On his show, Gilad usually has a very short warm up followed by jumping right in with weights and strength training, then you do some short but intense cardio, and then you go right back to sculpting. In UBS, Gilad's warm-up feels drawn out. I found myself looking at the clock and thinking, wow I'm not even working out yet. The workout itself is challenging (probably more-so for beginners), but not very much so (less for advanced people). I can cut Gilad a bit of slack since the balance here is tough--if it's too hard beginners will be turned off; if it's not hard enough, then advanced viewers will feel let down. But this is supposed to be ""ULTIMATE"" body sculpt. I feel that the completely free series that still airs on FitTV is more of a challenge. And TBS is only 45 min long after you cut out commercials!My abs definitely felt it after this workout, so this might be a good choice for someone who really wants to focus on defining their core or building core strength. But I didn't even break a sweat. Aside from a few leg moves, there isn't much ""more"". There's NO CARDIO at ALL, which it me is almost unforgivable. I can't call it a workout if I'm not dripping wet and exhausted at the end. And targeting your core will not give you a flat stomach if you don't burn that fat in the first place and I don't think I burned many calories or got my heart rate up during this workout.I was also sad to see Gilad's entertaining personality so constrained. He was pure business. There was no interaction or banter with his crew and this is one of my favorite parts of his shows--my girlfriend and I have actually laughed out loud at some of Gilad's antics. But there is no such fun on this disc. You get great pointers on form, but no sense of personality. The others working out with Gilad might as well be anyone. Whereas on his show I've come to really enjoy Arthur and Kelly and Steve and the others that accompany Gilad and serve both as examples to follow and objects of empathy and comedic releif. The lack of this dynamic is a real loss for the replay value.On the bright side, there were some new moves not used in his TBS show that I enjoyed. I just wish the pace was faster that there was less filler and that he could have thrown in some cardio or interval work. I don't see myself using this DVD. Why spend an hour on just my core when I can do my whole body in less time and also get cardio? Why spend my money on this DVD when I can get better from Gilad for free?I was quite let down by this DVD and I'm going to make sure to rent the others before I even THINK about buying them. If the other discs to this series are like this one, I may just pass and go back to Gilad's older stuff and maybe try to find some new instructors.Some people might enjoy this, but this just isn't what I look for in a workout program, nor is it Gilad's best. I'd recommend setting your DVR on FitTV and recording the free Total Body Sculpt series instead. Or, if you're already a Gilad fan, check out some of his other series and DVDs, such as Elite Forces.",3,The Ultimate Let-Down,1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,3197,"['workout', 'was', 'challenging', 'lacked', 'intensity', 'seemed', 'slow-paced', 'built', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'prefer', 'workouts', 'be', 'fast-paced', 'show', 'Gilad', 'usually', 'very', 'short', 'warm', 'up', 'followed', 'jumping', 'right', 'weights', 'strength', 'training', 'then', 'do', 'short', 'intense', 'cardio', 'then', 'go', 'right', 'back', 'sculpting', 'UBS', 'Gilad', 'warm-up', 'feels', 'drawn', 'out', 'found', 'looking', 'clock', 'thinking', 'wow', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'working', 'out', 'yet', 'workout', 'challenging', 'probably', 'more-so', 'beginners', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'less', 'advanced', 'people', 'can', 'cut', 'Gilad', 'bit', 'slack', 'balance', 'here', 'tough', 'too', 'hard', 'beginners', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'not', 'hard', 'enough', 'then', 'advanced', 'viewers', 'will', 'feel', 'let', 'down', 'supposed', 'be', 'ULTIMATE', 'body', 'sculpt', 'feel', 'completely', 'free', 'series', 'still', 'FitTV', 'more', 'challenge', 'TBS', 'only', '45', 'min', 'long', 'cut', 'out', 'commercials', 'abs', 'definitely', 'felt', 'workout', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'focus', 'defining', 'core', 'building', 'core', 'strength', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'break', 'sweat', 'Aside', 'few', 'leg', 'moves', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'CARDIO', 'ALL', 'almost', 'unforgivable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'workout', ""'m"", 'not', 'dripping', 'wet', 'exhausted', 'end', 'targeting', 'core', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'flat', 'stomach', 'do', ""n't"", 'burn', 'fat', 'first', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'burned', 'many', 'calories', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'workout.I', 'was', 'also', 'sad', 'see', 'Gilad', 'entertaining', 'personality', 'so', 'constrained', 'was', 'pure', 'business', 'was', 'interaction', 'banter', 'crew', 'one', 'favorite', 'parts', 'shows', 'girlfriend', 'have', 'actually', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'Gilad', 'antics', 'such', 'fun', 'disc', 'get', 'great', 'pointers', 'form', 'sense', 'personality', 'others', 'working', 'out', 'Gilad', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'anyone', 'Whereas', 'show', ""'ve"", 'come', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Arthur', 'Kelly', 'Steve', 'others', 'accompany', 'Gilad', 'serve', 'examples', 'follow', 'objects', 'empathy', 'comedic', 'releif', 'lack', 'dynamic', 'real', 'loss', 'replay', 'bright', 'side', 'were', 'new', 'moves', 'not', 'used', 'TBS', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'wish', 'pace', 'was', 'faster', 'was', 'less', 'filler', 'could', 'have', 'thrown', 'cardio', 'interval', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'using', 'DVD', 'Why', 'spend', 'hour', 'just', 'core', 'when', 'can', 'do', 'whole', 'body', 'less', 'time', 'also', 'get', 'cardio', 'Why', 'spend', 'money', 'DVD', 'when', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'Gilad', 'free', 'was', 'quite', 'let', 'down', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'going', 'make', 'sure', 'rent', 'others', 'even', 'THINK', 'buying', 'other', 'discs', 'series', 'are', 'one', 'may', 'just', 'pass', 'go', 'back', 'Gilad', 'older', 'stuff', 'maybe', 'try', 'find', 'new', 'instructors.Some', 'people', 'might', 'enjoy', 'just', ""n't"", 'what', 'look', 'workout', 'program', 'Gilad', 'best', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'setting', 'DVR', 'FitTV', 'recording', 'free', 'Total', 'Body', 'Sculpt', 'series', 'instead', ""'re"", 'already', 'Gilad', 'fan', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'series', 'DVDs', 'such', 'Elite', 'Forces']",Gilad: Ultimate Body Sculpt Series - Core and More

There are a lot of pilates movements incorporated here along with standard core work and crunches.
