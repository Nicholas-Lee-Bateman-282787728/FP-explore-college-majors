The humor is often on the dark side, obviously controversial to some people based on a few of the reviews I've read, or maybe it's just too subtle for others. But therein lies the beauty of it for me.I didn't perceive the religious twists that others have mentioned as derogatory or offensive in any way, because the whole concept is that no one had ever heard of or even thought of those things before. If someone insisted on being technical, I'd argue that the film represented many sides of the ""meaning of life."" It also attempted to show the emptiness that the people in the story had felt without the previous hope of something more than the ""here and now,"" without preaching some deep, hidden message ... because it's a comedy, pure and simple.It was intended to be a satirical scenario of how life would be if absolutely no form of untruth had never existed, everything single was taken literally, and no one had the forethought, compassion or basic ability to control what they were thinking verses what came out of their mouth. That would definitely change the world as we know it, and I for one don't want to know everything people think about me!I love a story that has something for everyone with an open mind ... to things they may or may not agree with personally, dark and/or subtle humor with a little racy humor thrown in, romance, scenarios that you might totally relate to, and most of all a view of something you'd never thought about before (or maybe you had!).Ricky Gervias is amazing at portraying a typical person who like almost everyone - good or bad - is a lot more than meets the eye.

1252864,A3BOGELRQJK8OE,B00275EHBY,a gentle sound,"[6, 9]","....Where it starts ""everything I say is a lie.""That is a good starting point for thinking about this movie as it essentially is a fiction to talk to you about truth. And that's going to be hard to hold because a good tale, good fiction on a big screen will feel so plausible.Hum.You enter a town/ world with everyone speaking the truth, and are immediately confronted with who is thinking of masturbation and the ins and outs of losers and beautiful people. A guy played by R. Gervais is on a blind date, or a date set up with a beautiful girl ""out of his league"" and he's about to lose his job. Nothing remains hidden. His mom's dying. His job is really brilliant writing scripts of historical events to be read by actors.That's movies in this world. He has a set of peole at work that hate him-he's a loser.  Recall a world with no myth. As history is told by the conquerors, and invariably a mess of half truth I thought that brilliant. He was stuck with the Black Plague and no one was ""into it."" So things are not going well at all for him. Plus he sees a lot of suffering, no one veils it. In fact they seem compelled to state it in the truthful vein.At this point, a bit into the film, I thought of what Woody Allen would have done with it.It would have been genius.Opps, it just would have been a philosophic masterpiece.I also thought of this bookWhy We Lie: The Evolutionary Roots of Deception and the Unconscious MindWhy Allen? the characters would have not been flat and the whole movie would address a dystopic utopia, ah well.The story line revolves around a guy (Gervais) that somehow ""invents"" lying. He then, because the entire world thinks differently, can cheat -and get rent money, he can tell people things they believe. And what he does is very limited, but does change his world.  The funniest part is his ""man in the sky"" on pizza boxes rules that sort of turns the world upside down.Yep, here comes that...People will believe that. But it does say ""be a good person"" even in a world run on looks. It's really hilarious. He invents this notion when his mother is dying, and he can't leave her to be so afraid, so he tells her that shes going to a place with a mansion, and everything paved with what money can get. It comforts her. She dies, he's overheard and it spawns religion.Woody would have made it genius.Like anything it gets complicated. And he still wants the girl.Who loves him but wants the best genetic match for off-spring. And that's just a big, big hurdle.If I say anything else it gives it all away.But that's the center of it all.It allowed me to think about lying, how lying functions in love, relationships, inter-relations, religions, belief and I think it implied or stated lying gives you hope.... and certainly was a nice movie to watch. I had to cover my mouth and suppress laughing being in a movie where no one even giggled. So that was interesting and kind of annoying. It was so quiet it was antiseptic.I thought that the premise was under-developed, and it was incredibly nice to get out to a comedy.Gervais I enjoyed watching. Kind of like I like to watch Bob Newhart-but not as great.

Why did Louis CK and Jennifer Garner waste their time by being in it? Trailers would lead you to believe that this is another slapstick comedy, but it's not. Normally, I'd be fine with that since I know trailers can get the tone of a movie all wrong (just look at the one for Wristcutters), and I wouldn't be upset if the movie tried something different. The Invention of Lying also appears to have split reviews into two sides- people who think the movie's anti-religion, and people who praise the movie for 'raising questions' as so many have put it. Me? I don't see the movie as being anything special at all, because it's full of the kind of things I hear on a regular basis whenever I take public transportation.The movie takes place in a world, very similar to ours as far as the appearance goes (buildings, jobs, etc.) but everyone tells the truth. If someone thinks another person is fat, they flat out say it and don't try to put things nicely. The main character, Mark, is trying to have luck dating, but things aren't going well at all because he's overweight. He just got fired from his job too, and doesn't have money to cover this month's rent. Basically, life sucks for him. But when he goes to the bank to get money, something in his brain snaps and he lies. He says that the computer made a mistake, and there's more money in his account than it says there is. The teller goes with it, since he must be telling the truth like everyone else, and from there, Mark's life gets a little better. Anyone believes anything he says because that's how the world is- what you say is what it is. But things make a huge turn when his mother is ill in a hospital, and he tells her about a place where everything's better when you die (basically heaven without calling it that), and that there's no sadness or anything bad. The doctors and other people overhear this, and want to know more. Through his little fib, Mark basically becomes a prophet of sorts, 'knowing' everything and speaks with God (again, without calling it that).Yes, I can see how this movie might be seen as anti-religious, since the message would be 'hey look, this guy made all this up, and people believed it'. Is it so bad that we should throw a fit over it and give it one star reviews because of it? No. It's because the movie is just bad. When Mark's mom dies (it happens very early on in the movie), the mood changes completely and you're wondering what happened because it's so abrupt. Until that point, the humor (and I'm using that term loosely) was standard British, dry delivery, and it got old fast. In the first 10 minutes, I was ready for the movie to be over. Once Mark lets people know about an afterlife and the rules to get into the good place, the movie changes into a more standard comedy, but trys to be one that makes you think. And the jokes aren't even funny either- they're the kind of things that hardcore athiests, the kind who flip out whenever they hear the word 'god' anywhere, would force themselves to laugh at just for attention. I'm not a Christian but these jokes were annoying more than anything. Having Mark write the rules of life on pizza boxes, as a nod to the ten commandments, and reading them to a huge crowd of people didn't do anything for me, and I'm the kind of guy who loves religious jokes by George Carlin, Lewis Black and Bill Hicks. Those ones make sense, and are funny. Here? Nothing. Everything's too in-your-face that it gets old fast, and it makes you wish that it had just been a standard dumb comedy. The plot also becomes a love story where Mark tries to win over Anna, played by Jennifer Garner, but she doesn't want him to be with her because she wants to have beautiful, successful children, and makes note constantly that he's fat.What's even worse is that Jennifer Garner and Louis CK were involved. Garner is a respectable actress, and it's like she only appeared in this movie to cover a payment on a new car. She tries her best with the material she's given, but because of the story- everyone believing what people say, you never like her character much because like all the others, she's rude and dumb. And Louis CK, oh lordy Louis CK...one of the funniest men most people haven't heard of. Do NOT use this movie as a decision on if you think he's funny or not, because his character was completely useless and didn't get a single joke. Check out his stand up or video skits if you want to see him really shine. There are other good actors like Jonah Hill, Tina Fey and Martin Starr, but their roles are brief.The picture and audio quality on the dvd were average. 'nothing special, and I didn't get to see any of the special features because once the movie was over, I immediately returned it. I didn't want this thing giving my dvd player E-STDs or anything.Again, this review comes from someone who's neither Christian or Athiest, or any religion for that matter. I'm not offended by what got most people riled up. There's just about nothing I liked about this movie: it's boring, way too long and not funny. But getting to look at Tina Fey was enough to bump up the score. If you go into this expecting anything smart, lower your expectations. Because you can probably get more out of searching through LiveJournal entries about religion from teenagers on anti-depressants. If written by anyone else, this movie could've had promise, but as it is, I'll just lie if people ask if I've seen it or not.",2,...what did I just watch here?,1270080000,"04 1,

1252875,A1DG75OT3Y49EM,B00275EHBY,"ashertopia ""@gmail .com""","[3, 5]","In the Invention of Lying we are presented with a world that has never known a lie. Everyone tells the truth at all times. This is so ingrained into the society that people don't even edit themselves as this must be considered to be a kind of deception by the writer and director, Gervais. So imagine that one man has mysteriously stumbled upon a way to say something that ""wasn't.""In a world like this someone who could lie would be a king! He would be rich, have any woman he wanted, be successful and even worshipped. In fact, Gervais' character does get all these things by his simple ability to deceive. Well, most of the time. Even this seemingly amoral liar seems to understand that the falsehood he tells are somehow wrong. After telling a beautiful woman that the world would end if she didn't have sex with him immediately he decides against it and tells her another lie so that he won't have to have sex with her. When given a chance to win the love of his life, he tells her the truth that would turn her away from him. Here is where the movie goes wrong for me.In the film, there is an acknowledgement that lying is immoral yet lying is shown to be the path to all of the joys that this man would otherwise not have had. He is rich, he is famous and all because he lies. And there is no moral judgment against this. This isn't very surprising when we consider that Gervais writes himself in as a prophet of sorts, making up religion and belief in the ""man in the sky"" while holding two pizza boxes with a sort of 10 Commandments feel to the scene. This is the commentary of Gervais shining through. It is obvious that he doesn't consider lying to be immoral. He considers religion to be a lie (in this world of only truth telling no one believes in God?)In my opinion, a morality tale would better fit this setup than a romantic comedy. Even the director may have seen his match with Jennifer Gardner as a mis-match as they have almost no chemistry and never kiss on screen. After the movie moves past the hilarious, unfiltered language at the start it moves into a celebration of immorality with no lessons to be learned and no growth in character. Everything is too easy and too unbelievable. It all works out for everyone, of course, except for the movie watcher.

The last thing I actually expect Hollywood to do nowadays is make a movie that is thought provoking, tackles some truly profound issues about the human condition, and is funny to boot.Ricky Gervais has won instant respect for me. I bet a friend before coming to Amazon (I rented the Blu-ray on Netflix) that there would be a bunch of 1 star reviews. And that none of them would actually be about the film per se or its quality but would be religious peoplem who, get offended when someone asks them to think about what they say they believe and why.Gervais ends up examining 2 aspects of the human condition, lying and religion. What would a world be like where people simply not only did not but could not lie. You get a number of humorous situations from this. It makes you think about the role of 'social lying' in particular. Manners, in a way, for lack of a better wordNow on to religion. I think Gervais hit on 2 issues that are very germaine. One how can an 'all good God' be responsible for the good and the bad. Very hard for anyone to explain although people try with that oldie 'everything happens for a reason'. Also explores an honest reaction to a 'god' well tourting people for eternity.Of more interest to me though was the potential consequences of becoming focused on an afterlife at the expense of this life. The character played by Jonah Hill represents an all too real condition. People who place less value on their life, this life, because everything will work out in the afterlife or that is the real life. This can create HUGE HARM to individuals, society, and the planet. If people don't treasure every day as it should be, if they don't treasure the earth as their home, if they don't treasure each and every species as their brothers and sisters, they risk missing out on exisistence, they miss out on the universe, they miss out on Life. And they do not, perhaps, treat the Earth, themselves, and each other with the depth and meaning they should. If the Earth to them is a shadow, how can it mean what it should?This is of course IMO. I am sure many people will disagree. But kudos, HUGE kudos, to Ricky for getting this on film.

Well, he goes through some difficulties, but in the end he wins. So I guess the moral of this stupid story is that it's OK to lie, even if you do it for personal gain.The only part of the plot that is good is that Mark wins over Anna because he truly loves her, unlike how hotshot Brad Kessler feels about her. That's fine and dandy, but that has nothing to do with lying. So basically, the whole premise of everybody always telling the truth and never lying is useless..there is no connection between that and the love triangle of those three, other than the fact that Mark is rich from telling a lie.

1252879,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00275EHBY,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[4, 5]","When I first saw a trailer for this movie, I did not know Ricky Gervais. What I saw of it, and just from the title, I thought the premise was pretty stupid and I was not interested. But on Tuesday my friend Kate came to visit, and recommended I see this. She said it's a lot about religion, which had not come through at all in the trailer.I enjoyed it quite a lot, actually. Any stupid premise can, it seems, support a pretty amusing movie if the lead actor has talent and imagination. In this case, Gervais not only played the lead, but was writer and director.Mark Bellison (Ricky Gervais) has wanted Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner) for a long time. But they live in a world where lying is completely unknown, and even keeping your thoughts to yourself seems pretty uncommon as well. Anna agrees to go on a date with Mark, but frankly admits she considers him a loser, and short, fat, and with a funny nose.Mark works for a film company that makes educational films. Of course there is no such thing as fiction, or even slanting the truth to make it more interesting. His department is history, and his century is the 14th. He finds it nearly impossible to write a movie script about the Black Plague that is not depressing in the extreme. He gets fired.The landlord demands the rent, which is $800 when Mark only has about $300 in his account. But something clicks in his brain and he tells the cashier he wants to withdraw $800. To his surprise, the teller gives it to him. He has just discovered (or invented) lying.There are some silly scenes where he tests his powers that basically make the point: in a world where everyone always tells the truth, a liar will be believed. If you say it, it must be true. He gets rich, of course.I won't give away how religion comes into it, save to point out that until lying was invented, there was no religion. Of course the old adage is even more true: oh, what a tangled web Mark weaves when first he practices to deceive.Does he get the girl? Come on, you know the answer to that.I recognized several of the other actors, like Rob Lowe plays Brad Kessler, the handsome, wealthy and conceited competition for Anna's affection. Actually, it's not so much affection as her selection of the genetic makeup of the father of her children.

Gervais is the British comedian that became know to many Americans for his portrayal of David Brent in the British TV hit ""The Office."" Gervais was great in The Office and he's been funny in bit parts in The Night at The Museum and in the movie ""Ghost Town.""But, this movie is all his. He stars in it and writes it, and, as this movie's captain, he goes down with the sinking ship.This movie isn't funny. All the funny parts are in the preview. Why? It is a one joke movie. Characters in the film CAN NOT TELL A LIE. So, when the beautiful Jennifer Garner tells Gervais she will go on a date with him but that he has no chance of sleeping with her and she never wants to have his kids because they will be fat and pug-nosed, it is funny. The first time. The same joke is not funny when it is repeated over and over.That's the problem with this movie. Sure, it has a great cast that includes Garner, Rob Lowe, Jonah Hill and Louis CK. But, every character being honest and sincere and never lying gets stale and predictable after awhile.I can't recommend this movie. It looks cheaply made and the gimmick doesn't work after twenty minutes. The poor quality of this movie has nothing to do with the entire plot thread about ""the man in the sky"" and where you go after you die. Some religious figures claimed it was offensive, but I think it is hard for someone to write good satire about religion when they have no idea what it means to be a believer in any faith.

1252886,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B00275EHBY,Brent Butler,"[7, 8]","""The Invention of Lying"" is a thoughtful movie that requires the viewer to pay attention, and to do some thinking, to appreciate many of its jokes and themes. Now, its also got some instant laugh concepts, but the funniest parts are where you have to put some mental gears to work to figure out where it is going.For example, in a world where no one lies, every film made is a historical documentary ... and fairly boring ones to boot. The writers did a marvelous job of projecting how the absence of lies would fit into many aspects of society, from advertising to product names ... from personal interactions to business decisions. In the process they came up with a marvelously humorous take on where our society constantly misleads people for all sorts of reasons.When Ricky Gervais' character learns to lie, he is able to get ahead in unfair ways, but even so he does not totally abandon the high ground ... he just sneaks down from it in some appropriate places, and a few inappropriate ones. However, he often abandons what could become the fruits of his lies because achieving his aims in those ways is ultimately unsatisfying to him.Much criticized has been the relatively short section that deals with religion. When Ricky Gervais' character lovingly tells his dieing mother a story to comfort her in her last moments, he is overheard by nearby doctors and nurses, who want to know more about what he told his mother, which by definition in their world must be the literal truth. I think what people have failed to see is that this section of the movie does not make fun of religion, but it does spoof certain man made beliefs about religion. It does a good job of showing that religion is a solid base upon which to build a set of moral and ethical principles that people can relate to and take seriously. It takes issue with the concept of God as a micro-manager, and it is true that those who see God as a micro-manager run into quite a few problems trying to explain how God can at the same time deliver blessings and large scale tragedies. It is legitimate food for thought, rather than being sacrilegious.This was a courageous movie to make in a day when block buster action and silly comedy rule.

1252892,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00275EHBY,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 10]","""The Invention of Lying"" is the antithesis of last summer's ""Henry Poole Is Here,"" which is to say that it's an atheistic comedy instead of a faithful drama. Both are narrow-minded in that they fail to address a simple truth: The existence of God can be neither proven nor disproven. Still, the concept of ""The Invention of Lying"" is a very clever one, and I appreciated the fact that it goes for satire instead of saccharine. It's often times quite funny, although never so goofy that the occasional serious statement doesn't work its way through. It's above all a great vehicle for Ricky Gervais, who not only stars but is also the co-writer and co-director. He plays Mark Bellison, a screenwriter living in an alternate reality in which no one has ever told a lie; one day, he discovers to his astonishment that he's capable of saying something that isn't true.Can you imagine a world free from lies? Books and movies as we know them would cease to be, and that's because fiction is untrue by definition. How, then, is Mark a screenwriter? Simple: In this world, movies are nothing more than a continuous shot of learned gentlemen sitting in a chair, reading out of history books. Such dullness is not limited to movies, though. Advertising is little more than confirming the existence of a given product, as seen during a Coca-Cola commercial (""It's basically just brown sugar-water,"" says a monotone man standing next to a plain-looking pedestal with a glass of Coke resting on it). No one uses flattery, and there's no such thing as sparing anyone's feelings; when Mark first meets his blind date, Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner), she greets him at the door by saying, ""I'm equally depressed and pessimistic about our date tonight."" Later on, during the date, she takes a call from her mother: ""He seems nice,"" she tells her. ""A bit fat. No, I won't be sleeping with him tonight.""It goes beyond that. Nursing homes go by names such as A Sad Place for Hopeless Old People. Waiters will tell you that they took a sip of the cocktail you ordered, and they will also tell you if you're way out of someone else's league. Homeless people carry signs saying, ""I don't understand why I'm homeless and you're not."" Co-workers, such as Mark's secretary, Shelley (Tiny Fey), will say with a perfectly straight face, ""I realize more and more everyday how overqualified I am for this position and how incompetent you are at yours.""I think you get the idea. When Mark is fired, he finds himself with not enough money to pay his rent. He then goes to the bank to close his account and withdraw all $300. Only then does a sudden impulse surge through his brain--instead of $300, he asks for $800, the amount needed to pay rent. Since he lives in a world where everyone tells the truth, the fact that the system says he has only $300 must be a mechanical error. The clerk hands him his money in large bills, and he's on his way. Now that he knows he's capable of lying (although no one in this world uses that specific word since it's an unknown concept), he sets about writing a fictional screenplay, which he tells everyone is a long lost historical document.Now, here's where it becomes a religious satire. During a genuinely touching scene, Mark tearfully tells his sick mother (Fionnula Flanagan) that death isn't an eternity of nothingness, that everyone goes to a place of love, happiness, and mansions where friends and family will be waiting. Astonished doctors pressure him into revealing more about what happens after you die, and soon, the entire world looks to him as a messenger. His ultimate explanation: A man living in the sky controls our destinies, is responsible for all the good and bad things that happen to us, and will reward us after we die if we never do evil things. Confused residents are bogged down by details such as what constitutes an evil thing and how many evil things we're allowed to do. It isn't long before Mark realizes how horribly out of control his lying has become.Tied in with this is a sweet yet perplexing love story, one in which Anna finds herself torn between Mark and a snide screenwriter named Brad Kessler (Rob Lowe), who has openly hated Mark since day one. Initially, Anna refuses to have anything to do with Mark simply because he's unattractive. She finds herself drawn to Brad because, as she puts it, he's a good genetic match; their children will not be fat and have snub noses. Here's the perplexing part: In this alternate reality, no one is capable of looking beyond a person's physical appearance. Is it not just as truthful to like someone for who they are and not what they look like? Even in a world where no one lies, it's still possible to meet someone who will say, ""I want to be with you not because of your looks, but because you're kind, funny, and intelligent.""Fortunately, satire and sheer audacity make up for the film's lack of plausible romantic situations. Gervais, with his biting humor and misanthropic persona, is well suited for this kind of material, and so is Garner, who adds such wonderful niceness to the story. Supporting performances from Jeffrey Tambor, Louis C.K., and Jonah Hill are decent, as are cameo appearances by Christopher Guest, Jason Bateman, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Stephanie March, Edward Norton, and Stephen Merchant. It probably would have served the story better to take an agnostic approach--I feel that films adamant in confirming or denying the existence of God are too limited in scope (I exempt Carl Reiner's wonderful ""Oh, God!""). Regardless, I'm recommending ""The Invention of Lying"" for its humor, its dialogue, and its fearlessness.",4,For Those Who Truly Don't Believe,1254528000,"10 3, 2009",2009,5639,"['Invention',

1252893,AN9J46667D80O,B00275EHBY,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[11, 15]","I've enjoyed Ricky Gervais ever since I first saw him in the UK version of The Office. His performance in his next series, Extras, was even better. Now comes The Invention of Lying, the first movie he (co)directed, and it is very entertaining!Basically what we have here is a movie set in a world where lying never evolved. As a result, lots of things are different (like a Pepsi ad that says, ""Pepsi: for when you can't find Coke""). Enter Mark Bellison (Gervais). He's a short little fat man with a stubby nose (as everyone keeps reminding him), and basically a loser. He writes screenplays for Lecture Films, a company that makes movie featuring a man sitting in a chair talking about history. Fiction never evolved, you see.Mark gets fired from his job and is at a real low point in his life. Stuck having to come up with $800 to pay his rent, he tells a teller in a bank that that's how much he has in his account. She believes him, why not, and gives him the $800 rather than the $300 actually there. Having discovered this new ability, for which he doesn't even have a work, Mark embarks on a series of life-changing events.Now this could've just been a one-dimensional situation played for easy laughs, and there's a bit of that at first, but then he's at his mother's deathbed, in tears and she tells him she's afraid of dying, of experiencing nothing for eternity (for the record, I'm not. How can one ""experience"" nothing, after all?). Thinking quickly, Mark tells her all about how there's a big man in the sky who will give her a mansion to live in and a chance to be reunited with all her loved ones. She dies happy, and the hospital staff are amazed at this sudden revelation of an afterlife.Mark has basically just invented religion.Gervais is an outspoken atheist, and I think that's clear in this movie, where the theory is that religion can't exist without lying. It's a fascinating concept and one well-explored within the film.There's parts of the movie that lag a little, and some concepts I would've liked to have seen explored a little more, but overall, this is a great film and one I recommend.",4,What would you do if everyone believed everything you said?,1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,2119,"[""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'ever', 'first', 'saw', 'UK', 'version', 'Office', 'performance', 'next', 'series', 'Extras', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'Now', 'Invention', 'Lying', 'first', 'movie', 'co', 'directed', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Basically', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'movie', 'set', 'world', 'where', 'lying', 'never', 'evolved', 'result', 'lots', 'things', 'are', 'different', 'Pepsi', 'ad', 'Pepsi', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'Coke', 'Enter', 'Mark', 'Bellison', 'Gervais', 'short', 'little', 'fat', 'man', 'stubby', 'nose', 'everyone', 'reminding', 'basically', 'loser', 'screenplays', 'Lecture', 'Films', 'company', 'movie', 'featuring', 'man', 'sitting', 'chair', 'talking', 'history', 'Fiction', 'never', 'evolved', 'see.Mark', 'fired', 'job', 'real', 'low', 'point', 'life', 'Stuck', 'having', 'come', 'up', '800', 'pay', 'rent', 'teller', 'bank', 'how', 'much', 'account', 'why', 'not', '800', 'rather', '300', 'actually', 'there', 'Having', 'discovered', 'new', 'ability', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'work', 'Mark', 'series', 'life-changing', 'events.Now', 'could', ""'ve"", 'just', 'been', 'one-dimensional', 'situation', 'played', 'easy', 'laughs', 'bit', 'first', 'then', 'mother', 'deathbed', 'tears', 'afraid', 'dying', 'experiencing', 'nothing', 'eternity', 'record', ""'m"", 'not', 'How', 'can', 'one', 'experience', 'nothing', 'Thinking', 'quickly', 'Mark', 'how', 'big', 'man', 'sky', 'who', 'will', 'give', 'mansion', 'live', 'chance', 'be', 'reunited', 'loved', 'ones', 'happy', 'hospital', 'staff', 'are', 'amazed', 'sudden', 'revelation', 'afterlife.Mark', 'basically', 'just', 'invented', 'religion.Gervais', 'outspoken', 'atheist', 'think', 'clear', 'movie', 'where', 'theory', 'religion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exist', 'lying', 'fascinating', 'concept', 'one', 'well-explored', 'film.There', 'parts', 'movie', 'little', 'concepts', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'explored', 'little', 'more', 'overall', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'recommend']",N/A

But I was willing to watch it, when my wife rented it instead. As it started, my concerns started to pan out. It wasn't just that nobody lied in this ""world""... They were also terribly gullible, and they tended to not just tell the truth, but rather they told the most NASTY truth they could about a person. So, it was more than a little bizarre, and took a while longer to get used to it because we weren't expecting it to be that out there. A slow start.Then it got more and more clever, and it started to make you think a bit. The movie really showed its brilliance for me when it took its religious twist. In this world, there has never been a belief in God or any gods. The main character creates it, and becomes like a combination Moses/Jesus for everyone for a good long time, as he convinces them there is a Heaven and that it pays to be nicer. It shows the audience how utterly silly the stories and premises of Christian religion are, while still showing that there are good principles and morals to take from its teachings. I think more people should see this movie and ask themselves if what we've grown up believing actually makes sense.My wife believes in the Christian God, and I am an Agnostic, so I found it humorous, while she was a bit quiet, absorbing. She agreed that the movie was quite good, but she didn't really break it down like we normally do, and I didn't want to pick a fight, by saying ""makes sense, doesn't it?"", but it kind of explained a lot of my own reasoning in a very clever way, and for that I will recommend this movie quite readily, in addition to the fact that it was plenty amusing to begin with!",4,A solid comedy with added appeal for Aethiests and Philosophers,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,1845,"['was', 'originally', 'dissuaded', 'renting', 'movie', 'low', 'ratings', 'even', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'previews', 'looked', 'pretty', 'funny', 'premise', 'movie', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'clever', 'was', 'willing', 'watch', 'when', 'wife', 'rented', 'instead', 'started', 'concerns', 'started', 'pan', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'nobody', 'lied', 'world', 'were', 'also', 'terribly', 'gullible', 'tended', 'not', 'just', 'tell', 'truth', 'rather', 'told', 'most', 'NASTY', 'truth', 'could', 'person', 'So', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'bizarre', 'took', 'while', 'longer', 'get', 'used', 'were', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'be', 'there', 'slow', 'start.Then', 'got', 'more', 'more', 'clever', 'started', 'make', 'think', 'bit', 'movie', 'really', 'showed', 'brilliance', 'when', 'took', 'religious', 'twist', 'world', 'never', 'been', 'belief', 'God', 'gods', 'main', 'character', 'combination', 'Moses/Jesus', 'everyone', 'good', 'long', 'time', 'Heaven', 'be', 'nicer', 'audience', 'how', 'utterly', 'silly', 'stories', 'premises', 'Christian', 'religion', 'are', 'still', 'showing', 'are', 'good', 'principles', 'morals', 'take', 'teachings', 'think', 'more', 'people', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'ask', 'what', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'believing', 'actually', 'sense.My', 'wife', 'Christian', 'God', 'am', 'Agnostic', 'found', 'humorous', 'was', 'bit', 'quiet', 'absorbing', 'agreed', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'break', 'down', 'normally', 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'pick', 'fight', 'saying', 'sense', ""n't"", 'kind', 'explained', 'lot', 'own', 'reasoning', 'very', 'clever', 'way', 'will', 'recommend', 'movie', 'quite', 'readily', 'addition', 'fact', 'was', 'plenty', 'amusing', 'begin']",N/A

The story concept is just too much of a stretch -- when Mark (Gervais) tells an obvious lie, you'd think people could at least wonder if he is somehow mistaken.

A society where no one has ever lied, everyone is taken at their word and when someone is told something it's taken as hard fact. One man discovers that he can lie, and it is like he has developed some kind of super power as he spins out several lies, one more fantastic than the next. Sounds good right?

Gervais does a decent job, but the material he's given is just awful. Within 2 minutes of the opening credits we get a series of un-funny jokes about masturbation???? And the writers must have thought they were really witty as that single joke is played out over and over again for like 16 hours. Ugh. We get tons of cameo appearances by a slew of celebrities like Tina Fey, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Edward Norton and Jason Bateman, but they don't really bring anything to the film except a mild sense of ""what the hell are they doing in this?"", I guess Gervais had some friends that owed him??

He is amazingly sharp witted  and talented with a style that reminds me of Ben Stiller, though he looks nothing like him. The Invention of Lying is clever, original, and irreverent. I loved hearing what we think spoken aloud, and how even before he discovered lying Gervais was the one person able to not say whatever popped into his mind and just react to the tactless and inappropriate comments being flung at him. Hilarious. I also thought his poking fun at Jewish/Christian beliefs and traditions was often insightful and really funny. What he picked as the basis for the first religion and the spread of religion was silly but rather fascinating too. I was on the edge of my seat along with the masses to hear the next ""commandment"" as well, ha ha.SPOILER The one thing that didn't work for me was at the very end what came across to me as atheist agenda pushing.  If it were say a movie about pretending to see aliens or claiming to talk to dead people, you'd say ""I don't really see dead people/aliens"" and not ""there are no aliens."" Also, at his mother's grave Gervais says ""I know you are in really in there (the ground)"" it would be better if he said ""I wish you really were in a mansion in the sky,"" that is, take a more agnostic in tone re: ""the man in the sky.""

1252906,AHPV4F8IVSC39,B00275EHBY,"Douglas B. Moran ""Computer+History/Politics""","[3, 8]","Although the promos may bring to mindGroundhog Day, this movie fails horribly in comparison.  Although Gervais' persona is very different from Bill Murray's sharp-witted cad, his character needs to be sharper and more driven to make the comedy work.  Instead, his character is someone who is content to bumble and stumble through.There are three significant categories of lying. First, lying to manipulate and exploit others--Gervais' character rejects this.  Second, ""white lying"" as a social lubricant and to comfort others.  This is the core of the lying by Gervais' character, but with one exception, these lies are too inconsequential to be interesting.  Third, lying to cover-up a previous lie.  Gervais' character indulges in this, but there is no sense of danger from the original lie being uncovered, and thus the cover-up is not frenetic, which is the basis of comedy for such situations.The movie has a romantic comedy component. A large part of romance are the lies we tell ourselves and each other, and thus was a great set-up for when one side is clueless about this.  Unfortunately, there is little more than what you see in the trailers, and even that wasn't funny (It is funny in the trailers simply because of the unexpected contrast of what is being said with how it is said, but that no longer applies when you see the movie).Similarly, the remainder of the script is totally unimaginative--bland and overly predictable--and I couldn't stop thinking of ways it could have become much, much funnier. Many of the jokes felt very familiar, as if they had been lifted from a stand-up comedy routine.Although religion has been a rich source of humor, the treatment here is so ham-handed and misdirected that even those who aren't religious may find it just plain mean-spirited, even despicable.Although I thought I had become desensitized to product placement, here it is so in-your-face and over-the-top as to be annoying and disruptive.

His screenplay for a movie about the Black Death is considered too downbeat and he's about to get sacked. He's also behind in his rent so he gets evicted. His date with Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner) is less than successful. When he goes to the bank to draw out all his cash and close the account, their computer systems are down, so the teller has to ask Mark for his account balance. Then he has a brilliant idea: instead of giving the teller the correct sum of $300 he tells her the balance is $800 - which of course she believes. His mother is dying in hospital and is frightened so Mark then invents an uplifting image of the afterlife to put her mind at ease. When a nurse overhears this, a whole new religious cult is created. He writes down some principles he thinks would be beneficial to humankind on two sheets of paper, puts them in two empty pizza boxes, and addresses the multitude from his front porch.

That is part of its charm. Around 37 minutes into it (if memory serves), ""WHAM!"", it follows true reality and goes completely off script. That's all I can tell you. But here's why you really need to see this movie:It's pure genius. The whole of it has a rather laid back feel, and the pacing is more a nice leisurely stroll through the park on a warm Autumn day than a Jason Bourne movie or the latest Transformers (both of which I enjoyed, but have nothing more to do with this review). This film draws you in slowly. For some of you it may seem a bit dry and boring, even pedantic at first--stay with it! This is the evolution of personal existence. This is real life as it happens. We go through our days performing our daily rituals and fulfilling our self-imposed duties and then we see something shiny and we pick it up, and suddenly the world starts to find color. This shiny new thing could be a relationship, or a new hobby, a passion for something we did not believe we could have before--or in this case--lying.The point of this film is (naturally) to entertain us, but just underneath is a series of layered messages and thoughts to ponder on our own lives and the society we live in. In much the same way foreign films tend to attract a certain demographic, this film, feeling a lot like a film foreign to Americans (in pace and structure) is meant to attract people who want to THINK while they are being entertained, rather than wait for glimpses of Megan Fox in a wet bikini (and who doesn't want to do that?). This is truly a film worth owning, and it is a film worth watching a few times (spaced apart by a few months). It gets under your skin and stays with you--and it will without a doubt upset more than a few knee-jerk religionists, but that is the other half of the fun.The movie is interesting, enjoyable and slow-paced enough to simultaneously allow the slow-to-catch-on to get the joke, but also allow those a bit faster on the up-take to digest the meaning of the joke while enjoying the film. Not at all a first date movie, but if you want to evaluate the relationship quality of your current romantic prospect, this is a MUST SEE.

1252909,A2LY87A30IOYNX,B00275EHBY,ecclesial hypostasis,"[12, 24]","Ricky Gervais is a very talented comedian, but there has been a huge disparity between the quality of his TV work and the movies he's been involved in. 'The Office' was a brilliantly observed character comedy, one of the greatest ever made. Hollywood, however, seems to see Gervais as a 'funny, fat British guy', so he's been relegated to silly bit parts or broad caricatures. In 'Invention of Lying' he had a chance to write and direct his own film, so there was potential for something great. Unfortunately it completely fails to live up to that promise.The premise of the story is that it takes place in a world where human beings do not have the capacity to tell lies. There are a few laughs at the beginning where we see the flat and boring world where creativity is non-existent (eg. the entertainment industry consists of someone sitting on a stool in front of a camera and describing historical events). Ricky Gervais' character, Mark Bellison, is a mediocre loser who one day discovers the ability to lie, and in an instant a world of possibilities opens up to him.You could do a lot with this idea, since deception of others and of ourselves constitutes a huge part of our lives. You'd expect that someone who could create a character like David Brent (whose entire tragic persona consisted of deceiving himself about his own abilities and other people's opinion of him) would open up rich veins of satire on this subject. However, what we get is just sketches of ideas that aren't fleshed out in any interesting way. There are limitless possibilities in charting the logic of this alternate world, but Gervais takes it nowhere. For instance, there is a romantic sub-plot involving Jennifer Garner's character, and how she may learn to overcome her truthful analysis of Mark as an evolutionary dud and see that his friendship is worth her love. Out of this you could create a myriad of twists and layers of irony about the nature of relationships, but this arc of the story just sits there until one day she realises that she can be with him despite his defects. The slightest bit of thought could have made it more interesting. For instance, she is not even consistent in her single motivation, because surely Mark's evolutionary fitness would be increased when he becomes the most influential and admired man in the world. The romantic ending is just sentimental and not at all satisfying, since there is no reason to want Mark to be with such a superficial woman.The main part of the story is about Mark inventing a religion in order to comfort his dying mother, which then takes on a life of its own. A lot of people have been offended by this, but the real offense is in how lazily this idea is handled. To essentially just state baldly that 'religion is lies' is not satire, it is an ideological position. For it to be funny we would need to see more of how this might develop, perhaps giving Mark a dose of self-deception so that he is uncertain whether he is speaking the truth or not. I mean, just because people are incapable of lying doesn't mean that what they say is necessarily true, since they may just be mistaken. There should be room in this movie perhaps for people to develop alternate 'true' religions, for example, since the tensions of competing truth claims are a part of our own society. But Ricky didn't make the effort for some reason. Anyway, good religious satire is usually focussed on a specific group that has identifiable values and tropes, not just religion in general. For instance, a film like 'Dogma' hilariously skewered modern Catholicism in a way that spoke to the genuine weaknesses in that group while still conveying a sympathy for those who are part of it. 'The Invention of Lying' doesn't show that level of sophistication.I've given this movie one star because of the drastic gap between its potential and its realisation, because it was boring and unfunny, because it was a complete waste of Ricky Gervais' talent, because it represents a capitulation to the lowest common denominator of Hollywood comedic sensibility by someone who made one of the greatest television shows of all time.",1,A waste of talent,1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,4144,"['Ricky', 'Gervais', 'very', 'talented', 'comedian', 'there', 'been', 'huge', 'disparity', 'quality', 'TV', 'work', 'movies', 'been', 'involved', ""'The"", 'Office', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'observed', 'character', 'comedy', 'one', 'greatest', 'ever', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'however', 'see', 'Gervais', ""'funny"", 'fat', 'British', 'guy', 'been', 'relegated', 'silly', 'bit', 'parts', 'broad', 'caricatures', ""'Invention"", 'Lying', 'had', 'chance', 'write', 'direct', 'own', 'film', 'was', 'potential', 'something', 'great', 'Unfortunately', 'completely', 'live', 'up', 'promise.The', 'premise', 'story', 'place', 'world', 'where', 'human', 'beings', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'capacity', 'tell', 'lies', 'are', 'few', 'laughs', 'beginning', 'where', 'see', 'flat', 'boring', 'world', 'where', 'creativity', 'non-existent', 'eg', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'someone', 'sitting', 'stool', 'front', 'camera', 'describing', 'historical', 'events', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'character', 'Mark', 'Bellison', 'mediocre', 'loser', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'ability', 'lie', 'instant', 'world', 'possibilities', 'him.You', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'idea', 'deception', 'others', 'huge', 'part', 'lives', ""'d"", 'expect', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'create', 'character', 'David', 'Brent', 'entire', 'tragic', 'persona', 'consisted', 'deceiving', 'own', 'abilities', 'other', 'people', 'opinion', 'would', 'open', 'up', 'rich', 'veins', 'satire', 'subject', 'However', 'what', 'get', 'just', 'sketches', 'ideas', 'are', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'interesting', 'way', 'are', 'limitless', 'possibilities', 'charting', 'logic', 'alternate', 'world', 'Gervais', 'nowhere', 'instance', 'romantic', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'character', 'how', 'may', 'learn', 'overcome', 'truthful', 'analysis', 'Mark', 'evolutionary', 'dud', 'see', 'friendship', 'love', 'could', 'create', 'myriad', 'twists', 'layers', 'irony', 'nature', 'relationships', 'arc', 'story', 'just', 'there', 'one', 'day', 'can', 'be', 'defects', 'slightest', 'bit', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'instance', 'not', 'even', 'consistent', 'single', 'motivation', 'surely', 'Mark', 'evolutionary', 'fitness', 'would', 'be', 'increased', 'when', 'most', 'influential', 'admired', 'man', 'world', 'romantic', 'ending', 'just', 'sentimental', 'not', 'satisfying', 'reason', 'want', 'Mark', 'be', 'such', 'superficial', 'woman.The', 'main', 'part', 'story', 'Mark', 'inventing', 'religion', 'order', 'comfort', 'dying', 'mother', 'then', 'life', 'own', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'offended', 'real', 'offense', 'how', 'lazily', 'idea', 'handled', 'essentially', 'just', 'state', 'baldly', ""'religion"", 'lies', 'not', 'satire', 'ideological', 'position', 'be', 'funny', 'would', 'need', 'see', 'more', 'how', 'might', 'develop', 'perhaps', 'giving', 'Mark', 'dose', 'self-deception', 'uncertain', 'speaking', 'truth', 'not', 'mean', 'just', 'people', 'are', 'incapable', 'lying', ""n't"", 'mean', 'what', 'say', 'necessarily', 'true', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'mistaken', 'should', 'be', 'room', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'people', 'develop', 'alternate', ""'true"", 'religions', 'example', 'tensions', 'competing', 'truth', 'claims', 'are', 'part', 'own', 'society', 'Ricky', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'effort', 'reason', 'Anyway', 'good', 'religious', 'satire', 'usually', 'focussed', 'specific', 'group', 'identifiable', 'values', 'tropes', 'not', 'just', 'religion', 'general', 'instance', 'film', ""'Dogma"", 'hilariously', 'skewered', 'modern', 'Catholicism', 'way', 'spoke', 'genuine', 'weaknesses', 'group', 'still', 'conveying', 'sympathy', 'who', 'are', 'part', 'Invention', 'Lying', ""n't"", 'show', 'level', 'sophistication.I', ""'ve"", 'given', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'drastic', 'gap', 'potential', 'realisation', 'was', 'boring', 'unfunny', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'talent', 'capitulation', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'Hollywood', 'comedic', 'sensibility', 'someone', 'who', 'made', 'one', 'greatest', 'television', 'shows', 'time']",N/A
1252910,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00275EHBY,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 6]","The alternate universe presented by co-writers and directors Ricky Gervais and Matthew Robinson in this 2009 comedy is a world of such unfettered honesty that the human race has become devoid of any imagination or creative energy. It's a clever idea to show how mundane life would become without any deception, and the premise is explored with laser-sharp sparks of wit during the movie's first half. The problem is that Gervais and Robinson also want to tell a feel-good love story, and that's where their grand concept falls short. It's a film that brings to mind Peter Weir and Andrew Niccol'sThe Truman Showsince both share a meticulous view of a skewed society and a jaundiced perspective on the people who surround the put-upon protagonist. However, Weir's movie at least reflects a more audacious sensibility that turned out to be prescient with the advent of reality television. Gervais and Robinson, on the other hand, set out to create a broad fantasy landscape and then fall back to romantic comedy formula when the questions become too big for their movie to answer. It's a disappointing turn of events.The plot centers on Mark Bellison, a lecture-film writer who is convinced by everyone around him that he is an abject failure. He goes out on a blind date with Anna McDoogles, a beautiful woman who readily admits she is not attracted to him physically or financially. However, she likes him regardless, and this is meant to tether us to their evolving relationship. When Mark loses his job and is unable to pay the rent, he comes upon an unprecedented solution...he lies to the bank teller about how much money is in his account, and she, of course, believes him since everyone tells the truth. Mark immediately recognizes his new-found power and tries to help his bedridden mother and suicidal neighbor as a matter of course. However, he inadvertently lands on a bigger ticket item, the idea of faith. He invents the concept of ""the man in the sky"" and a code of ethics that he scribbles down overnight on two pizza boxes that are made to look like Moses' tablets. The scene where he attempts to explain these proclamations to the anxious throngs is the movie's funniest bit. Up to this point, most of the humor is derived from the characters surrounding Mark, all of whom are so committed to telling the truth that they can't help but share too many embarrassing details.However, the movie doesn't have any place to go thematically and ends up on a simplistic message: don't judge a book by its cover. The relationship between Mark and Anna is rather mystifying since it presumes that Anna is worthy of Mark's obsession. That is truly arguable. It takes all of Jennifer Garner's considerable charms to make the character remotely likeable, but she remains a pinheaded cipher due to the constraints of the story's premise. As Mark, Gervais remains clever and likeable but is not actor enough to give his character any dimension beyond misbegotten prevaricator and smitten puppy. Rob Lowe has already proven adept at playing handsome cads, and he again shows his comic chops as Mark's genetically superior rival for Anna's heart. Among several star cameo appearances from the likes of Edward Norton and Christopher Guest, Tina Fey provides the funniest moments as Mark's heartless secretary. The extras on the 2010 DVD are worthwhile, including a comic featurette, ""Prequel: The Dawn of Lying"", which shows how cavemen invented lying as an unbilled Patrick Stewart provides a stentorian voiceover. Other extras include another comic short spotlighting Karl Pilkington, Gervais' co-host on ""The Ricky Gervais Show""; a satirical making-of featurette; additional scenes and outtakes; and intermittently amusing video podcasts from Gervais and Robinson.",3,Gervais Fluctuates Between Tentative Prevaricator and Hopeless Romantic in a World Without Lies,1264550400,"01 27, 2010",2010,3764,"['alternate', 'universe', 'presented', 'co-writers', 'directors', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'Matthew', 'Robinson', '2009', 'comedy', 'world', 'such', 'unfettered', 'honesty', 'human', 'race', 'become', 'devoid', 'imagination', 'creative', 'energy', 'clever', 'idea', 'show', 'how', 'mundane', 'life', 'would', 'become', 'deception', 'premise', 'explored', 'laser-sharp', 'sparks', 'wit', 'movie', 'first', 'half', 'problem', 'Gervais', 'Robinson', 'also', 'want', 'tell', 'feel-good', 'love', 'story', 'where', 'grand', 'concept', 'short', 'film', 'mind', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Andrew', ""Niccol'sThe"", 'Truman', 'Showsince', 'share', 'meticulous', 'view', 'skewed', 'society', 'jaundiced', 'perspective', 'people', 'who', 'surround', 'put-upon', 'protagonist', 'However', 'Weir', 'movie', 'least', 'more', 'audacious', 'sensibility', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'prescient', 'advent', 'reality', 'television', 'Gervais', 'Robinson', 'other', 'hand', 'set', 'out', 'create', 'broad', 'fantasy', 'landscape', 'then', 'fall', 'back', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'formula', 'when', 'questions', 'become', 'too', 'big', 'movie', 'answer', 'disappointing', 'turn', 'events.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'Mark', 'Bellison', 'lecture-film', 'writer', 'who', 'convinced', 'everyone', 'abject', 'failure', 'out', 'blind', 'date', 'Anna', 'McDoogles', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'readily', 'not', 'attracted', 'physically', 'financially', 'However', 'regardless', 'meant', 'tether', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'When', 'Mark', 'job', 'unable', 'pay', 'rent', 'unprecedented', 'solution', 'bank', 'teller', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'account', 'course', 'everyone', 'truth', 'Mark', 'immediately', 'new-found', 'power', 'tries', 'help', 'bedridden', 'mother', 'suicidal', 'neighbor', 'matter', 'course', 'However', 'inadvertently', 'bigger', 'ticket', 'item', 'idea', 'faith', 'concept', 'man', 'sky', 'code', 'ethics', 'down', 'overnight', 'two', 'pizza', 'boxes', 'are', 'made', 'look', 'Moses', 'tablets', 'scene', 'where', 'explain', 'proclamations', 'anxious', 'throngs', 'movie', 'funniest', 'bit', 'Up', 'point', 'most', 'humor', 'derived', 'characters', 'surrounding', 'Mark', 'whom', 'are', 'so', 'committed', 'telling', 'truth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'share', 'too', 'many', 'embarrassing', 'details.However', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'place', 'go', 'thematically', 'up', 'simplistic', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'relationship', 'Mark', 'Anna', 'rather', 'mystifying', 'Anna', 'worthy', 'Mark', 'obsession', 'truly', 'arguable', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'considerable', 'charms', 'make', 'character', 'remotely', 'likeable', 'pinheaded', 'cipher', 'due', 'constraints', 'story', 'premise', 'Mark', 'Gervais', 'clever', 'likeable', 'not', 'actor', 'enough', 'give', 'character', 'dimension', 'misbegotten', 'prevaricator', 'smitten', 'puppy', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'already', 'proven', 'adept', 'playing', 'handsome', 'cads', 'again', 'comic', 'chops', 'Mark', 'genetically', 'superior', 'rival', 'Anna', 'heart', 'several', 'star', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'likes', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'funniest', 'moments', 'Mark', 'heartless', 'secretary', 'extras', '2010', 'DVD', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'including', 'comic', 'featurette', 'Prequel', 'Dawn', 'Lying', 'how', 'cavemen', 'invented', 'lying', 'unbilled', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'stentorian', 'voiceover', 'Other', 'extras', 'include', 'comic', 'short', 'spotlighting', 'Karl', 'Pilkington', 'Gervais', 'co-host', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'Show', 'satirical', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'additional', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'intermittently', 'amusing', 'video', 'podcasts', 'Gervais', 'Robinson']",N/A

1252914,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B00275EHBY,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","Every once in a while, a movie comes along that is as funny as it is thought-provoking. I've always thought of The Truman Show as one such film. The Invention of Lying is another. I wasn't sure what to expect given that most modern comedies are worthless garbage, but I was very pleasantly surprised.The Invention of Lying features an alternate reality in which humans are incapable of lying or distorting the truth. Everybody simply states whatever is on their mind, no matter how rude or disrespectful. That is, until Ricky Gervais tells one lie and realizes the awesome power of lying.In the movie, the lack of lying doesn't just mean people aren't deceitful. The Invention of Lying takes this concept into more interesting directions, such as showing a lack of originality in movies without an ability to stretch the truth (all films are simply narrations of historical events). Another odd development is the introduction of empathy and kindness with as Gervais learns how to tell ""white lies"" and solve people's problems.Of course, the biggest (and most controversial) change is the invention of religion. As Gervais' character begins to lie, he also tells half-truths to comfort people. When his mother is near death, he invents a wonderful image of heaven to allow her to pass in peace. As word gets out, he soon begins preaching about ""the man in the sky"" in an attempt to convince people to choose right over wrong. However, the plan backfires as people start neglecting reality and simply pine for heaven.At some moments, The Invention of Lying goes too far (Jennifer Garner's first line was ""I was masturbating""). I don't think the humor trashes religion too much. In fact, it doesn't ""trash"" religion at all and never really makes inappropriate comments about religion. As long as you're open-minded, I think it'll be possible to watch the movie and laugh.The larger problem for me is that the movie seems schizophrenic at times and loses sight of the theme (a world without lying). The first half of the movie features Ricky Gervais and his conversion to compulsive lying. However, as his relationship with Jennifer Garner's character gets more serious, there's a lot more discussion about class and genetics (being honest, she rejects his romantic advances because he's short and has a stubby nose). In fact, a few times I thought I was watching a rerun of Gattaca. While I think it's definitely time for another sci-fi movie about society and genetics, The Invention of Lying isn't that movie. The directors should have stuck closer to the original premise. Or better yet, they could have created a different Ricky Gervais comedy with a plot revolving around genetics.Overall, it should have been two movies, not one.

Building a world and playing in that world is the fun of the movie, but sooner or later you have to resolve it according to the rules laid out and it makes for some awkward endings....hence this movie.""The Invention of Lying"" was written and directed by Ricky Gervais and Matthew Robinson. Gervais also stars as Mark Bellison, a chubby fellow with a good heart and some bad luck who happens in a moment of desperation to have figured out how to lie.....in a world that NEVER has.This movie has a very strong beginning as we explore a world where people have to tell the truth about how they feel every second, but where they can't even have lies of omission by keeping their mouth shut. These people feel the need to be absolutely honest about everything that floats into their brains creating hilarious dialogues between characters and it is a LOT of fun. Eventually an event happens and the ability to lie seemingly turns on in Mark's brain and then we get to play with THAT situation as he tries to explain what he has discovered to friends and they don't understand what he is talking about, they don't even have worlds like ""true"" and ""false."" Then we watch him use the situation to his advantage and it's still very funny!Eventually, there's a switch and the movie changes. I could instantly see why some people might complain or be offended by this movie after the change. The writer/director combo touched on a big idea with enormous potential for comedy. After it was introduced, it become more difficult for the movie to be funny as they neared the climax and they had to come up with a way to end it.

Of course, the whole bit about being the first to think of telling a lie worked very well in setting up how religion was developed (and a god conceived of) in order to deal with the fear of death.  But there was also a real double-edged sword to this idea because the way it was portrayed really brought to my mind William Blake's conception of God, which was that God was the imagination.  Gervais' character was struggling within a souless, materialistic, extremely shallow and dertministic society, but then broke through to a whole new sense of awareness: the inspiration that he could make things up, that he could imagine,  he could be creative.  The act of creation, of projecting the imagination (giving birth to something out of nothing), was in William Blake's mind a god-like act.  As the character invented lying he was also opening up himself, and others, to the realm of the spirit which had been totally lacking in this bluntly materialistic world.  This also brought to mind M.C. Escher's sketch of the artist's hand drawing itself into existence - another powerful image of a process that could be considered devine (at least if you're William Blake).  I thought it was brilliant and hilarious how Gervais explored this idea to both tear down and expose the creation of religion from the perspective of a psychological defense mehanism, and, at the same time, reveal the underlying, transformational process that is at the source of human wonderment and renewal.  An athiest could watch this film and feel his opinions reinforced, but so could a believer in the devine - not so much a religious fundamentalist, but someone in touch with both ""Songs Of Innocence"" and ""Songs Of Experience"", like William Blake.  The power to create allowed Gervais' character to project into the world values that he felt were very much lacking, like compassion and love, and recognizing the internal truths, not just external beauty and wealth.  This ability to create allowed him to humanize others around him, at least those who were open to it, unlike Rob Lowe (he was perfect in that part).  Rickey Gervais is a very perceptive performer, and writer, which would explain his frustration and anger at the world around him - a great source of humor, by the way.",5,Rickey Gervais Meets William Blake,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,2384,"['thought', 'was', 'really', 'brilliant', 'philosophical', 'areas', 'Gervais', 'explored', 'humor', 'wonderful', 'film', 'course', 'whole', 'bit', 'being', 'first', 'think', 'telling', 'lie', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'setting', 'up', 'how', 'religion', 'was', 'developed', 'god', 'conceived', 'order', 'deal', 'fear', 'death', 'was', 'also', 'real', 'double-edged', 'sword', 'idea', 'way', 'was', 'portrayed', 'really', 'brought', 'mind', 'William', 'Blake', 'conception', 'God', 'was', 'God', 'was', 'imagination', 'Gervais', 'character', 'was', 'struggling', 'souless', 'materialistic', 'extremely', 'shallow', 'dertministic', 'society', 'then', 'broke', 'whole', 'new', 'sense', 'awareness', 'inspiration', 'could', 'make', 'things', 'up', 'could', 'imagine', 'could', 'be', 'creative', 'act', 'creation', 'projecting', 'imagination', 'giving', 'birth', 'something', 'nothing', 'was', 'William', 'Blake', 'mind', 'god-like', 'act', 'character', 'invented', 'lying', 'was', 'also', 'opening', 'up', 'others', 'realm', 'spirit', 'had', 'been', 'totally', 'lacking', 'bluntly', 'materialistic', 'world', 'also', 'brought', 'mind', 'M.C', 'Escher', 'sketch', 'artist', 'hand', 'drawing', 'existence', 'powerful', 'image', 'process', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'devine', 'least', ""'re"", 'William', 'Blake', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'hilarious', 'how', 'Gervais', 'explored', 'idea', 'tear', 'down', 'expose', 'creation', 'religion', 'perspective', 'psychological', 'defense', 'mehanism', 'same', 'time', 'reveal', 'underlying', 'transformational', 'process', 'source', 'human', 'wonderment', 'renewal', 'athiest', 'could', 'watch', 'film', 'feel', 'opinions', 'reinforced', 'so', 'could', 'believer', 'devine', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'religious', 'fundamentalist', 'someone', 'touch', 'Songs', 'Innocence', 'Songs', 'Experience', 'William', 'Blake', 'power', 'create', 'allowed', 'Gervais', 'character', 'project', 'world', 'felt', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'lacking', 'compassion', 'love', 'recognizing', 'internal', 'truths', 'not', 'just', 'external', 'beauty', 'wealth', 'ability', 'create', 'allowed', 'humanize', 'others', 'least', 'who', 'were', 'open', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'Rickey', 'Gervais', 'very', 'perceptive', 'performer', 'writer', 'would', 'explain', 'frustration', 'anger', 'world', 'great', 'source', 'humor', 'way']",N/A

But I think the concept behind this story (a world where nobody lies, nor understands the concept of deceit -- until one day Ricky's character can and does) does not get explored or capitalized on like it should.  If fact, the concept misleads a bit.In this movie's bucolic universe, no one lies and everyone believes everything they are told.  The misstep in the script is in how that is shown.  There is a difference between not being able to lie and feeling the need to share every thought, no matter how trivial.  Just because a person can ONLY tell the truth, it doesn't necessarily follow that everyone should speak their every thought out loud.  So we really have TWO premises at work here --  everyone says what's on their mind at all times, and everyone speaks frankly and without tact.  Withholding an opinion isn't the same thing as lying, and spouting one's every opinion isn't a requirement of not being able to lie, but this script does not make that distinction.So we're left with a world where everyone is brutally honest but needlessly so.  It's funny at first, but it's a one-joke premise that grows old quickly.  It would probably be better as a short skit than a feature-length movie.Gervais's script wastes little time mocking organized religion as a function of people blindly believing every ludicrous thing they are told.  But it plays more like an extended gag that interrupts the main story line, a man-pining-for-beautiful-but-unattainable-girl story.Because the truth-spouting characters are also incapable of restraint and spew forth every thought they have, some of them -- in particular the lead female character and the object of Gervais' character's desire -- come off as really shallow and unlikeable people.  After a while it seems impossible that Gervais' sad-sack character could still be in love with the lead female after all the needlessly horrible things she says to him.  I can't understand what he loves about her.But if he falls out of love with her, the story derails.  So it plays out to its inevitable but ultimately illogical conclusion.Gervais proved with ""The Office"" (UK version) that he is a gifted writer, actor, and humorist.  But this story is half-baked and ultimately emptier than it could have been.I think there could have been much more interesting material and concepts to be mined from a world where no one except ONE GUY knows how to lie.  Instead of swinging for the fences, Gervais seemed content hitting an infield single.  The story does stretch a bit to include some sweetness mixed in with the mocking of religion's followers.  But I believe that the writers didn't try very hard to have anything important to say or explore.That's the truth.

I'm familiar with Gervais and have heard great things about him, but somehow his TV shows and movies have eluded me. The Invention of Lying is my introduction to him and it makes for great entertainment.Gervais plays Mark Bellison, who lives in alternate reality where the human race has not adapted the ability to lie. It's hard to deny this is an interesting idea and the opening scenes of the film are quite funny. Mark works as a screenwriter at a film studio, where films consist of a man on screen reading a script based on an event in history. Writing a story requires a certain amount of lying, after all. On the verge of getting fired and rejected by the girl of his dreams (Jennifer Garner) because he's overweight; Mark sees his life in a downward spiral. On the eve of being evicted from his apartment, Mark tells the world's first lie and with his newfound ability a way to improve his life in every aspect.The film has an eclectic cast including Jonah Hill (as Mark's suicidal neighbor), Jeffrey Tambor, Rob Lowe (as an esteemed screenwriter), and Tina Fey. Furthermore, there are two very funny cameos by Phillip Seymour Hoffman (as a bartender) and Edward Norton (as a cop).The entire alternate reality is a marvelous idea and Gervais keeps it from growing old within minutes. The Coke/Pepsi gags, as well as the brutally honest business names are consistently amusing.Obviously, The Invention of Lying is built on a gimmick. In the hands of lesser writers, this gimmick could have run out of steam very quickly, yet Gervais keeps the wit, social commentary (involving religion), and energy consistent throughout. The Invention of Lying is a strong comedy film that had me laughing very hard, but also had me thinking. If the film didn't descend into predictability towards the end (while still retaining its charm), I would say it's one of my favorite films of 2009. Alas, Gervais has fashioned a comedy that is smart, underrated, and very well-done...Definitely worth your time.GRADE: B+",4,"A Terrific, Intelligent Comedy",1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,2129,"['Ricky', 'Gervais', 'Matthew', 'Robinson', 'co-write', 'co-direct', 'Invention', 'Lying', 'film', 'honestly', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'like', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'Gervais', 'have', 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'somehow', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'have', 'eluded', 'Invention', 'Lying', 'introduction', 'great', 'entertainment.Gervais', 'plays', 'Mark', 'Bellison', 'who', 'alternate', 'reality', 'where', 'human', 'race', 'not', 'adapted', 'ability', 'lie', 'hard', 'deny', 'interesting', 'idea', 'opening', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'Mark', 'screenwriter', 'film', 'studio', 'where', 'films', 'consist', 'man', 'screen', 'reading', 'script', 'based', 'event', 'history', 'Writing', 'story', 'certain', 'amount', 'lying', 'verge', 'getting', 'fired', 'rejected', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'overweight', 'Mark', 'life', 'downward', 'spiral', 'eve', 'being', 'evicted', 'apartment', 'Mark', 'world', 'first', 'lie', 'newfound', 'ability', 'way', 'improve', 'life', 'aspect.The', 'film', 'eclectic', 'cast', 'including', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Mark', 'suicidal', 'neighbor', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'esteemed', 'screenwriter', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'Furthermore', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'funny', 'cameos', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'bartender', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'cop', '.The', 'entire', 'alternate', 'reality', 'marvelous', 'idea', 'Gervais', 'growing', 'old', 'minutes', 'Coke/Pepsi', 'gags', 'as', 'well', 'brutally', 'honest', 'business', 'names', 'are', 'consistently', 'amusing.Obviously', 'Invention', 'Lying', 'built', 'gimmick', 'hands', 'lesser', 'writers', 'gimmick', 'could', 'have', 'run', 'steam', 'very', 'quickly', 'yet', 'Gervais', 'wit', 'social', 'commentary', 'involving', 'religion', 'energy', 'consistent', 'Invention', 'Lying', 'strong', 'comedy', 'film', 'had', 'laughing', 'very', 'hard', 'also', 'had', 'thinking', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'descend', 'predictability', 'end', 'still', 'retaining', 'charm', 'would', 'say', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2009', 'Alas', 'Gervais', 'fashioned', 'comedy', 'smart', 'underrated', 'very', 'well-done', 'Definitely', 'time.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

C) it was funny. Not the best funny I've ever seen, but anything that touches the religious third rail and gets out alive is a miracle. Yes, the irony is intended. D) I added the fourth star just for the hell of it to counter the numerous one star reviews that hacked at the film from all extremes: far right and far left and far snobby and far dumb.Apparently when a filmmaker hasn't made the film you already had in your head, that's a bad thing. Fair enough. I've had my share of films like that. But this film was by no stretch of the imagination a one star film. Love it or hate it, it took a great idea and made a mainstream film. That's all. It had good acting and while the story was weak at points, it was strong at points as well.For anyone reading this thinking that it is an ""attack"" on religion: Pshaw. If it's an attack on anything, it's an attack on not thinking for yourself. When Bradshaw asks Gervais, ""What does the man in the sky want me to do?"" Gervais doesn't answer her and walks away. Now, he could have said: ""The man in the sky may give you a mansion when you die, and love eternal, but while you're living he would appreciate it if you would let him off the hook for every damn little thing that happens to you, he'd appreciate it, if, from time to time you could make up your own damn mind.""As for the ""not smart enough"" crowd, I repeat--mainstream movie.

1252951,A2CON4GD056OGB,B00275EHBY,Louisa the Lemming,"[2, 5]","In a world where nobody can lie, and nobody has ever been able to lie, one man (writer/director/producer Ricky Gervaise) figures out how.Given that premise, the movie was not what I expected at all.  My initial complaint was that everybody seemed to have Tourette's Syndrome rather than just truthfulness.  Characters blurt out their masturbation habits, private insecurites, and nasty thoughts without even being asked.  It wasn't funny or clever, or consistent with what I thought to be the premise.However, I soon realized that ""Lying"" in this film is defined so broadly that eliminating it amounts to a profound change in human nature.  In this world, there is no such thing as fictional stories, and no dramatization of true stories.  Everything is strictly literal, with no metaphor.  Religion, which involves the use of inadequate words to describe the ineffable, is not possible.  There is no compassion (because that's ""pretending to care"" I guess).  There is no romance, single folks look around for good providers with good genetic material.  Poetry is mentioned, but it must be bad.""No lying"" also means no privacy for oneself or consideration for others, with people blurting out every embarrassing or hurtful thing that crosses their minds.  To quote G.K. Chesterton, there is ""no cloak of courtesy, no stages of intimacy, no free will in friendship"".  Except that what was for Chesterton an ""unfathomable insult"" against human dignity is simply the way everybody treats everybody else all the time without remorse or compunction.  And here you thought ""no lying"" would be good . . . or at least funny.While an interesting notion, this blighted portrayal of human nature eliminates the prime source of comedy -- human embarassment -- while making all the characters flat and unlikable.  Also, this world is poorly developed: For example, despite lacking religion, their history seems to have followed the same course as ours.  Where Monty Python might have used this as fuel for comic absurdity (like giving ""truthful"" reasons for the Crusades or the Pilgrims or the refusal of William Penn to take off his hat) Gervaise just lets it lie there like a dead fish.  The ""blockbuster movie clip"" we see shows a boring lecture on Napoleon, instead of having some fun with poor Napoleon's attempts to run a perfectly transparent dictatorship.  Could Hitler have come to power by being completely honest?  I'd like to see him try.  Not in this film.So instead of exploiting its actual PREMISE, most of the film is devoted to yet another Whiny Male Saga of a Dumpy Guy pining for the Hot Babe Who Must Learn To See His True Worth -- written by yet another jerk too shallow to realize the hypocrisy of this whole premise.  Yawn!  The hero's growing friendship with a suicidal fellow-loser is the only emotional positive, and that doesn't amount to much.  The death of his mother (which prompts him to invent religion to comfort her) is too real and sad a scene for the rest of the film.  With a little taste and good judgment, the same point could and should have been made via an annoying urchin burying her pet hamster.Speaking of taste and good judgment:  As you may have gathered, ""Lying"" is defined so broadly in this film that calling religion a ""Lie"" doesn't make it false in any meaningful sense.  But there is a deeper problem here.  To me, irreverent humor depends upon a sense of reverence, just as bawdy humor depends upon a sense of propriety.  The nudist scene in A SHOT IN THE DARK is only funny because Inspector Clousseau possesses a sense of modesty to be mortified, and because we relate to this.  The old gag where a sap bad-mouths someone who turns out to be standing behind him is only funny if the sap would never do such a thing on purpose.  Frank Drebin's disastrous encounter with the Queen of England in NAKED GUN is only funny in context of the attitude that Her Majesty really ought to be treated with respect.  So in order to work, irreverent humor needs to play off a sense of reverence, like King Arthur's in HOLY GRAIL.  (""We're averting our eyes, o Lord!"")  Otherwise it would just be pointless and mean-spirited.And mean-spirited is just how this film comes across much of the time.  Rick's impromptu impersonations of Jesus and Moses are not funny, are not trying to be funny, and make no point.  They are lifeless non-jokes which result not from irreverence, but from the soulless modern sensibility which allows for no ""cloak of courtesy"" to be draped around the Sacred in the first place.  In ye olden days, those who made jokes at the expense of religion felt obliged to actually be funny, which was itself a form of respect.  It is the lack of any such effort here which is offensive.In fact, the filmmaker is treating his audience with the same bland contempt that the clueless cretins in his film show towards eachother.  He had a good idea in his head, and simply blurted it out on screen without care or forethought.  The result as lacking in romance, tenderness, imagination, delicacy and humor as his characters.  I agree that it provides food for thought. But to actually make a good film, you need to think BEFORE you roll the cameras.",2,Good idea . . . Bad movie.

Everyone just says what they think, without caring how the other person feels.  It was funny to see how often we lie to mask our real feelings, flatter people to get what we want, and smooth out embarrassing situations.  The advertisements for Coke and Pepsi as well as political campaigns were funny satire..  The first part of the movie stays on message and is funny, but then the movie becomes too much of a tiring romantic tale between Mark (Ricky Gervais)  and the girl he loves played by Jennifer Garner. Over and over we have to listen to why she is too good for him, and her genes are better than his.  Yawn.  Another major turn in the story takes on religion and veers to atheism.  There is a very touching scene when Mark's mother is dying and worrying she will just drift off into ""nothingness"" and Mark promises her she will be young again, meet all her old friends and family and everyone will live in a mansion.  This is overheard by hospital staff,.  After his mother dies, the staff ask him how he knows that a wonderful place awaits everyone after they die?  Mark said the ""Man in the Sky"" told him and only he can hear his words.

Not only do people not lie, they do not censor their thoughts, and therefore what's said can seem absurdly insensitive.  Nobody ever questions the truth, because there is nothing other than the truth to question.When her mother calls mid date Anna says she does not find Rich attractive, and she will not be having sex with him, as he is not a genetic match, and she does not want her children having snub noses.  We get to know Rich by his reaction.  In fact he is the one person in this world who does not have to say everything he thinks.As events unfold disastrously for Rick, he finds himself in the position where he becomes the first liar.  Telling the lie opens up opportunities, and ultimately becomes the path to fame and fortune if not to his hearts desire.  It's an exploration of truth and lies, and not a glorification of either one.Ultimately, he becomes the first person to posit thoughts about the afterlife, which everyone believes without question. However, he recognises that lying to Anna, while it would work will yield only a hollow victory. Is it possible to win Anna from the clutches of the perfect match without lying?While Ricky Gervais may not be your typical leading man, he does have a tremendous and admirable creative ability, as evidenced by his creating the BBC seriesThe Office - The Complete Collection BBC Edition (First And Second Series Plus Special)andExtras - The Complete Series (Includes Series Finale), and a tremendous understanding of comedy.  The American Office starring Steve Carell, has now run successfully for multiple seasons.Having previously only experienced Jennifer Garner as a dramatic actrees, and not being overly impressed, I was impressed by how great a comedienne she is here. I did not buy into Anna and Rich as a romantic couple, but the whole movie is very cleverly done.When I returned to my local video store, I noticed Invention of Lying was sold out, four vacant shelves of dvd cards.The Hangover (R-Rated Single-Disc Edition), had two shelves and only half sold out. That says a lot about this movie. I found Invention of Lying to be one of the better comedies I have seen recently. He is a clever clogs, isn't he?This movie won't appeal to everyone.  Inevitably, though specific deity names are not mentioned, one can form the opinion that the the 'man in the sky' is some convenient fiction, which it is, to convey Ricky Gervais atheist beliefs, which it does, and some people will interpret this as an attack on their beliefs, and find it offensive.  If you feel you might fall into that category, then I recommend you skip this one.

1252956,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00275EHBY,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[5, 8]","At the start of THE INVENTION OF LYING, I thought immediately of the comedian Daniel Tosh.  In his albumTrue Stories I Made Up, he makes this statement as one of his jokes: ""You wanna make your life better with zero work on your part?  Start lying about everything in your life.""  Tosh's album came out four years before this movie, and it seems like that line is the direct heart behind the film's whole premise.The movie takes place in a fictional world where the concept of lying has never existed.  What this means is that fiction is nonexistent, so movies are simply protracted history lectures.  It also means (as Gervais has envisioned it) that the human race has evolved to lack any tact whatsoever.  People don't just tell the truth; they tell it without any provocation and every chance they get.There's a difference between honesty and full disclosure, but the movie doesn't care about that.  It's funnier (for a little while, anyway) to watch everyone give their unfiltered opinions of each other without twitching an eye.  It's as if the Earth is filled with erudite children.  The world is immature, but it is also placidly and ably vocal about it.Mark (Gervais's character) is a put upon fellow, mainly because he's so pudgy (an observation that Gervais's script makes literally two or three dozen times), but when he develops the ""ability"" to lie, just as Tosh predicted, his life becomes instantly better.  Since deception has never been conceived of, the world believes his every word, and thus he gets everything he's ever wanted.With the exception of Anna (Jennifer Garner).  The first half of the movie, if not repetitive, is still fun (not the least of which for the numerous cameos -- Tambor, Norton, Hoffman, Fey, and many others).  However, when Mark accidentally creates the concept of heaven and a ""man in the sky,"" things begin to spiral out of hand.  Both for him, and for the plot.At this point, the movie, fumbling with such a grand premise, chooses to focus on Mark's attempted wooing of Anna, who loves Mark, but can't bring herself to be with him because of his weak ""genetic code.""  The problem here is that Gervais seems interested in Anna solely because she's so hot.  Otherwise she's as clueless, selfish, and inconsiderate as the rest of the world.  Likewise, much is made of how much fun Anna has with Mark, but their times together are always cut off before the audience is allowed to see any kind of real chemistry.Lacking that chemistry, the film becomes a vehicle for an old moral: don't judge a book by its cover.  This could've been a complex statement, considering that Gervais's cover is not just pudgy but also riddled now with lies, but the movie turns it into the simplest of valentines.  It should also be pointed out that the second half of the film feels very much like a promotion of atheism or -- at the very least -- a explanation of what Gervais believes is at the heart of both humanity and religion, namely, more selfishness and a complete disavowal of personal responsibility.  To religious believers, the film will certainly come across as a slap in the face, although I doubt it was intended as such.",3,No Pants Were Set On Fire In The Making Of This Film,1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,3163,"['start', 'THE', 'INVENTION', 'OF', 'LYING', 'thought', 'immediately', 'comedian', 'Daniel', 'Tosh', 'albumTrue', 'Stories', 'Made', 'Up', 'statement', 'one', 'jokes', 'wan', 'na', 'make', 'life', 'better', 'zero', 'work', 'part', 'Start', 'lying', 'about', 'everything', 'life', 'Tosh', 'album', 'came', 'out', 'four', 'years', 'movie', 'line', 'direct', 'heart', 'film', 'whole', 'premise.The', 'movie', 'place', 'fictional', 'world', 'where', 'concept', 'lying', 'never', 'existed', 'What', 'fiction', 'nonexistent', 'movies', 'are', 'simply', 'protracted', 'history', 'lectures', 'also', 'Gervais', 'envisioned', 'human', 'race', 'evolved', 'lack', 'tact', 'whatsoever', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'tell', 'truth', 'tell', 'provocation', 'chance', 'get.There', 'difference', 'honesty', 'full', 'disclosure', 'movie', ""n't"", 'care', 'funnier', 'little', 'while', 'anyway', 'watch', 'everyone', 'give', 'unfiltered', 'opinions', 'other', 'twitching', 'eye', 'Earth', 'filled', 'erudite', 'children', 'world', 'immature', 'also', 'placidly', 'ably', 'vocal', 'it.Mark', 'Gervais', 'character', 'put', 'fellow', 'mainly', 'so', 'pudgy', 'observation', 'Gervais', 'script', 'literally', 'two', 'three', 'dozen', 'times', 'when', 'ability', 'lie', 'just', 'Tosh', 'predicted', 'life', 'instantly', 'better', 'deception', 'never', 'been', 'conceived', 'world', 'word', 'thus', 'everything', 'ever', 'exception', 'Anna', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'not', 'repetitive', 'still', 'fun', 'not', 'least', 'numerous', 'cameos', 'Tambor', 'Norton', 'Hoffman', 'Fey', 'many', 'others', 'However', 'when', 'Mark', 'accidentally', 'concept', 'heaven', 'man', 'sky', 'things', 'begin', 'spiral', 'hand', 'plot.At', 'point', 'movie', 'fumbling', 'grand', 'premise', 'focus', 'Mark', 'attempted', 'wooing', 'Anna', 'who', 'Mark', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'be', 'weak', 'genetic', 'code', 'problem', 'here', 'Gervais', 'interested', 'Anna', 'solely', 'so', 'hot', 'Otherwise', 'clueless', 'selfish', 'inconsiderate', 'rest', 'world', 'Likewise', 'much', 'made', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'Anna', 'Mark', 'times', 'together', 'are', 'always', 'cut', 'off', 'audience', 'allowed', 'see', 'kind', 'real', 'chemistry.Lacking', 'chemistry', 'film', 'vehicle', 'old', 'moral', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'complex', 'statement', 'considering', 'Gervais', 'cover', 'not', 'just', 'pudgy', 'also', 'riddled', 'now', 'lies', 'movie', 'simplest', 'valentines', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'promotion', 'atheism', 'very', 'least', 'explanation', 'what', 'Gervais', 'heart', 'humanity', 'religion', 'namely', 'more', 'selfishness', 'complete', 'disavowal', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'religious', 'believers', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'come', 'slap', 'face', 'doubt', 'was', 'intended', 'such']",N/A

1252962,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00275EHBY,Miles D. Moore,"[4, 16]","Ricky Gervais has been publicized as the combined reincarnation of Charlie Chaplin and Peter Sellers. But although I think the man has talent, I have yet to see any signs of genius from him. Indeed, ""The Invention of Lying,"" which Gervais co-wrote and co-directed with Matthew Robinson, suggests strongly he is reaching the limits of his competence. The story has a clever enough premise, postulating a world in which no one can even conceive of lying, tact, or imagination. People tell you flat out that they hate you or are threatened by you, movies consist strictly of armchair historical lectures, and nursing homes bear names such as, ""A Sad Place for Hopeless Old People.""In this incessantly literal world, Mark Bellison (Gervais) suddenly discovers he can steal a march on everyone else by, in his words, saying things that aren't. He can get enough money to pay his rent by telling a bank teller he has more money in his account than he actually does; he can persuade a beautiful blonde to sleep with him by telling her the world will end if she doesn't. The plot goes on, providing fairly frequent chuckles and an occasional belly laugh, until the scene where Bellison sits by the deathbed of his mother (Fionnula Flanagan). The old lady is terrified at the prospect of eternal nothingness, so Bellison invents on the spur of the moment a beautiful place where dead souls go, where everyone has a mansion and is surrounded by everyone they loved in life. The old lady dies comforted, and the hospital staff, overhearing, demands to hear more.This leads to the funniest scene in the movie--one worthy of Monty Python--in which Bellison is forced to invent religion on the spot, including commandments written on pizza boxes. (The constant product placements--not only Pizza Hut but also Coke, Pepsi, and Budweiser--are a major irritant in this film.) However, the film falls flat after this scene, because Gervais--rather than playing his bold heresy for all it's worth--retreats to the insipid love triangle between Bellison, the lovely Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner) and the loathsome Brad Kessler (Rob Lowe).I have two problems with ""The Invention of Lying""--one personal, one esthetic. As someone who, shall we say, doesn't keep a copy of ""The God Delusion"" on my coffee table, I feel insulted by Gervais' smug atheism, in which he asserts that plain truth equals a godless universe and anyone who disagrees is a self-deluded fool. But Gervais is entitled to his beliefs; the bigger problem for the movie is that he simply doesn't capitalize on his ""Man in the Sky"" plot twist, so that the story becomes a yawning gulf of missed opportunties. For example, politics: couldn't Bellison have a meteoric career in politics, outfoxing his opponents with constant pronouncments from The Man in the Sky?

Nai ""a fan of dark music""","[0, 1]","As mentioned in the many other reviews this movie takes place in a world where people may look like we do but instead, in it live people who are incapable of lying. The concept of lying is unknown to anybody there as is the case of hyperbole, satire and acting. It seems everyone in this world is not morally, but simply physically unable to lie. Things such as murder, rape and racism are known but the word lying doesn't even exist so when Ricky Gervais' character dicovers he has this ability. He uses it as he sees fit. Bascially no matter what he says people believe him simply they cannot fathom someone telling something untrue no matter however absurd that may seem to someone of this world.Now this movie will understandibly upset a lot of people because also in this world there is no religion and/or any belief of an afterlife. So when he says to his dying mother that when she dies she will go to to another place and live happily and eternally and other people hear him say this. he becomes an unwitting sort of a prophet. Let's just say that some of the things he says and some things depicted in the movie may have more than passing ressemblance to current religions in this world and some may find that insulting.Also it seems that everyone in this world seems to have a...ummm prediliction to marrying they find a genetic good match. The protagonist being chubby a bit short and have a ""stub nose"" is always referred to as a loser. I guess someone like Bill Gates in that world would also be a loser beacuse he is not handsome and i guess, may be below average looking.Overall i found the movie okay. I wasn't at all offended. I just didn't find the movie all that funny. As Newton Ooi, below me said watch this movie for its originality not for entertainment.

Just as my husband put the movie in he mentioned that Gervais is an athiest.  Well, I felt sorry for him but intended to enjoy the movie because the man is hysterical. He can really deliver a line and I find him adorable.Well, it starts off with lots of references to sex..and in crude ways. I'm not a prude...but you do NOT want your children watching this...especially in the first ten minutes.Then the movie proceeds to make a POINT of putting down and making fun of everyone who believes in God. God is a 'made up' character by Gervais in this movie.  Everyone in the movie tells the truth, 100% of the time.  Only at a point does Gervais' character become the first person EVER..ANYWHERE to tell a lie.He uses this lie to commit crimes (for money and hopefully sex...) and eventually help some folks.  Then when he needs answers about his lies...he makes up ""god"" and calls him the man in the sky who kills people, causes all sin and strife and sickness in the world...but also causes good things to happen.THEN he goes to church, where a sign outside says ""A quiet place to sit and think about the man in the sky.""  While the first second, this is funny..the next you realize it.  Gervais, Garner, not-so-shockingly Lowe, are all making fun of anyone who has the slightest belief in God at all.I was sad that Gervais not only starred in it, but wrote it.I wish I had never rented it or watched it. At the very, very least, I will closely scrutinize every movie I see any of the 'stars' of this movie...taking part in.

1252967,A2Y47HN5IP85J,B00275EHBY,M. Richardson,"[2, 5]","On one hand, this little film exceeded all my expectations: I expected a stupid, insipid one-joke comedy that would be forgotten in a week. This is what the trailers led me to believe.Well, the trailer lies. I've never seen such a complete disparity between what the trailer led me to expect and what I actually got. This is one of the most thoughtful comedies I have seen in a long time.It is also one of the most disappointing.But wait, didn't I say it just exceeded all of my expectations? I did indeed. But it is disappointing because it is easy to see how much better this film could have been. Buried under an almost childish need to shock the audience (and, thus, a lack of self-restraint), a lack of understanding of the film's central gimmick, and a lack of nerve to explore this film's more radical implications is the skeleton of what could have become a comedy masterpiece.Unfortunately, it is not.If you've seen the trailer, you know basically what the film's big gimmick is: the people in this hypothetical world are unable to lie. There's no concept of truth or falsehood, because nobody has ever needed to make the distinction. These people can't conceive of any other kind of reality. This has some implications which lead to a number of the film's funniest jokes (while I do not want to ruin these for people, I will use one as an illustration: commercials, since they cannot lie to the audience and manipulate them psychologically as real commercials do, are nothing more than a spokesman for the company in question begging the consumer to please buy their product, even though (in the case of the spokesman for Coca-Cola) it will make your kiddies fat. The film is filled with this kind of witty ribbing.) It would have been easy to fill the film with increasingly crass and outlandish jokes resulting from the condition of this world. The film avoids this, however, and maintains a level of self-respect I would never have expected of it.This gimmick is only a springboard, however, for a deeper subject: religion and humanity's need for some level of self-deception.This is really the heart of the film, and it is totally unexpected. It touches on a whole host of philosophical issues (is lying ever bad, or are there times when it is more ethical to lie than to maintain the solemn truth? what is the nature of the connection between religious belief and morality? Do humans at core require some level of self-deception to be happy? And just what is the nature of happiness, anyway? Even if religion is untrue, isn't it still preferable for a dying old woman who is terrified by the thought of eternal nothingness to believe in an afterlife and be comforted and profoundly relieved in her last few minutes of life? And what is the nature of love and sexual attraction: is it more prudent to follow your emotions or to provide your children with superior genetic material? And what do we mean by 'superior' genetic material-- superior in what sense? etc. etc.) I could go on. The film is brimming with all sorts of questions. Unfortunately, it never goes past merely hinting at these questions, and it never explores the implications of its atheistic message. It seems as though, having gone so far as to say that God doesn't exist, it is afraid of pushing any further and alienating its audience any more than it already has. Was this due to a legitimate lack of nerve on the part of the creative minds behind this film, or was there pressure to tone down the atheist stuff by the film's financial backers? I don't know, but this is about as honest as a big-budget studio film can possibly get. It could have been more honest, though, and consequently more insightful. This should have been an independent film. And the creative minds behind this should have more fully explored the implications raised by it.I mentioned a lack of self-restraint: it is obvious that the intended scenes are supposed to shock the audience with the jarring way people just spout whatever is on their mind. But they don't always do this, especially when it would be inconvenient for the plot. And the inability to lie does not mean that people would have no self-restraint. The film goes overboard to shock us, but it grants later on that these people CAN restrain themselves. So have they also not evolved the ability to feel shame? Where does it end? How different are these people? I really wish, instead of trying to shock the audience South Park style it would have just laid out the rules coherently and stuck to them. It would have helped the film tremendously.The film winds down with one of the most formulaic endings I've ever seen to a romantic subplot. It is sub-blockbuster. If they couldn't pull off a love story that was believable at all, they should have left that element out of the movie.The film is really a mixed-bag. It's an intelligent high-concept romantic comedy with a witty satirical edge and some uproariously honest and brilliant scenes, but which suffers from a formulaic romantic subplot, a lack of nerve, and a childish compulsion to shock the audience, even at the cost of the film's internal coherency. I would still recommend seeing this, though: it is still a hundred times better than the vast majority of comedies out there (with a few notable exceptions, such as Pleasantville or Groundhog Day, two films which had the nerve to probe below the surface and found water). See it, and try not to get too offended. It isn't out to insult you.",3,It Had So Much Potential!,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,5481,"['one', 'hand', 'little', 'film', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'expected', 'stupid', 'insipid', 'one-joke',

Welcome to a skewed British comedy where the world as it is known is completely void of lying.  Everyone tells the bald, bitter truth.  There is no fiction.  No one even has a concept of the opposite of truth, at all.  Enter Mark Bellison (Ricky Gervais), a schlepy, slightly-bloated lecture film screen-writer (who writes for the 1300's which seems to be the most boring period in human history). He goes out on a date one night with beautiful, wealthy Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner), where she proceeds to tell him how unattractive she finds him and that they will probably never date again (so painfully terrible it's excruciatingly funny).  Depressing.  He then goes to his job where everyone, including his demeaning secretary (Tina Fey) and his neurotic boss, is telling him he's about to be fired.  Then on to the hospital to visit his mother, whom everyone tells him is on the verge of dying, even though she seems perfectly fine.  What a life?  When Mark is finally fired he finds himself about to be evicted and has to go to his bank to remove the last of his funds in order  to move his belongings from his flat or they will be thrown away.  While confronted with homelessness he hurries to the bank where a mindless bank teller is asking how much he had in his account to withdraw because the system is down.  He has $300.  His rent is $800. Mark has an epiphany.  What if he didn't tell the truth? What if?  All great movies and novels and so forth start with that great question.  What if?  He tells the teller he had $800, and since lying doesn't exist, she forks the money over with a smile. What follows is Mark trying to get the woman he wants (Garner) sending his mother off to the after-world with a promise of mansions and love and awesomeness, and a whole lot more.The Invention Of Lying is not hysterical by any means, it's actually rather heart-warming in places, but you will laugh and you will feel moved by it's thought-provoking tendencies. And its originality.  Definitely worth the watch. Fresh.  Charming.  Smart. British. All that you could hope for, right?

1252971,ADYNO5CD0GVFE,B00275EHBY,"Mud Pyramid ""rilaly""","[8, 28]","The gist of this movie is that the greatest lie ever told to man is the existence of God. The fictional movie also exists in a world where everyone always tells the truth, no matter how bold or harsh. No one, in this movie, even knows what a lie is-hence the name of the movie. The Gervais' character discovers the idea of lying in another scene, and he realizes that it makes life much easier for him in some ways. In another scene, his mother is dying, and she is fearful and desperate. She believes that she will face an eternity of nothingness following her death. In a desperate attempt to soothe her, Gervais' character invents a place of mansions and happiness (heaven). The doctor and nurses overhear this, and they are intrigued. Word gets out that Gervais' character has received information of an after-life. He is pursued for this information, and he invents a man in the sky (God). The people are irrationally soothed by Gervais' character's ideas. There are no counterpoints to Gervais' character's claims in the movie, and there is no counterpoint of enlightenment. The character merely claims at the end that he invented the whole thing.I feel it's my duty to inform you that this is not a chick flick, and it's average. It is not as good as Gervais' other movie Ghost Town, and it's not as good as his shows Extras or The Office. The aspect about the `lie of God's existence' is not listed on the back jacket of the movie, and it's not in any of the promos I saw. It caught me off guard. Now that you know, feel free to rent, buy, or download if this is your thing.As to the counterpoint, it would've been nice to see some commentary about the other side. Example: While some believe in the existence of a man in the sky, others believe the sky is falling (i.e. Global Warming). While some believe that a bum on the streets is always a victim of circumstance, others believe they are there as a result of some form of self-indulgence. While some believe in the mythical assistance men in the leadership roles of government can provide to humanity, others believe that the key to success and happiness in life is through self-sufficiency.It may have been difficult to fit such counterpoints into the plot, but Gervais could've done it. He could've seen Americans indulging themselves in a love of the principles of Capitalism, and he could've invented a lie such as, ""there's a man in Washington who lost in a run for president, and he decided he needed a legacy, so he latched onto an idea that stated that our indulgence is causing a catastrophe of epic proportions."" He could've then had certain people of the world irrationally worship that man, give him a Nobel Peace Prize, and Gervais could've had this man avoid any dissent and debate with some wild declaration along the lines of ""all the science is in. This catastrophe is happening."" He could've had irrational exuberance occurring on both sides, but I'm sure he didn't want to offend anyone.",1,Athiest Entertainment,1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,2969,"['gist', 'movie', 'greatest', 'lie', 'ever', 'told', 'man', 'existence', 'God', 'fictional', 'movie', 'also', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'always', 'truth', 'matter', 'how', 'bold', 'harsh', 'one', 'movie', 'even', 'what', 'lie', 'is-hence', 'name', 'movie', 'Gervais', 'character', 'idea', 'lying', 'scene', 'life', 'much', 'easier', 'ways', 'scene', 'mother', 'dying', 'fearful', 'desperate', 'will', 'face', 'eternity', 'nothingness', 'following', 'death', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'soothe', 'Gervais', 'character', 'invents', 'place', 'mansions', 'happiness', 'heaven', 'doctor', 'nurses', 'overhear', 'are', 'intrigued', 'Word', 'out', 'Gervais', 'character', 'received', 'information', 'after-life', 'pursued', 'information', 'man', 'sky', 'God', 'people', 'are', 'irrationally', 'soothed', 'Gervais', 'character', 'ideas', 'are', 'counterpoints', 'Gervais', 'character', 'claims', 'movie', 'counterpoint', 'enlightenment', 'character', 'merely', 'end', 'invented', 'whole', 'thing.I', 'feel', 'duty', 'inform', 'not', 'chick', 'flick', 'average', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Gervais', 'other', 'movie', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'shows', 'Extras', 'Office', 'aspect', 'lie', 'God', 'existence', 'not', 'listed', 'back', 'jacket', 'movie', 'not', 'promos', 'saw', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'Now', 'know', 'feel', 'free', 'rent', 'buy', 'download', 'thing.As', 'counterpoint', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'commentary', 'other', 'side', 'Example', 'believe', 'existence', 'man', 'sky', 'others', 'believe', 'sky', 'falling', 'i.e', 'Global', 'Warming', 'believe', 'bum', 'streets', 'always', 'victim', 'circumstance', 'others', 'believe', 'are', 'there', 'result', 'form', 'self-indulgence', 'believe', 'mythical', 'assistance', 'men', 'leadership', 'roles', 'government', 'can', 'provide', 'humanity', 'others', 'believe', 'key', 'success', 'happiness', 'life', 'self-sufficiency.It', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'fit', 'such', 'counterpoints', 'plot', 'Gervais', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'could', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Americans', 'indulging', 'love', 'principles', 'Capitalism', 'could', ""'ve"", 'invented', 'lie', 'such', 'man', 'Washington', 'who', 'lost', 'run', 'president', 'decided', 'needed', 'legacy', 'latched', 'idea', 'stated', 'indulgence', 'causing', 'catastrophe', 'epic', 'proportions', 'could', ""'ve"", 'then', 'had', 'certain', 'people', 'world', 'irrationally', 'man', 'give', 'Nobel', 'Peace', 'Prize', 'Gervais', 'could', ""'ve"", 'had', 'man', 'dissent', 'debate', 'wild', 'declaration', 'lines', 'science', 'catastrophe', 'happening', 'could', ""'ve"", 'had', 'irrational', 'exuberance', 'occurring', 'sides', ""'m"", 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'offend', 'anyone']",N/A

The story is simple enough; mankind has not learned how to lie, and we witness the very first man acquire and use this ""talent.""  Set in modern-day America, most likely a small town in the New England countryside, this story shows what society might be like if everyone told the truth, and nothing but the truth, without pause or censorship.  Now first of, if I were a thinking man, I would straight away ask if American society would have developed towns, cars, dress styles, businesses and other features if no lie was ever told?  I doubt it, so the entire setting of the movie is somewhat ""artificial"" to start of with.  But if we pass on this and look at the plot itself, we find another problem.  Everybody speaks the first thing that comes to their mind.  In fact, everyone goes out of their way to speak the first thing in their mind, or is supposed to.  If this were literally true, the movie's dialogue would progress like a stream-of-consciousness novel.  But what the movie actually shows is a rude world wherever everyone looks down and talks down to everyone else.  So a more appropriate title would be ""The Invention of Pause, Politeness, Second Thoughts, and Lying"".  Even taking this into account, the movie is quite boring in places as the movie is essentially exploring a society different from ours.  So there are long scenes of dialogue devoid of comedy, action, suspense or romance.  Which of course makes for a boring movie.

You can check the other reviews and see why - religion is ""invented"" according to this movie.""The Invention of Lying"" takes place in an alternative world, where lying was never used - not even ""No, that dress doesn't make your butt look big"" or ""oh, yes, cute baby"". It's a painful world to live in, where every thought spills out of your mouth without any censoring. So if your assistant is looking for another job on work time, she'll tell you in no uncertain terms.But Mark discovers lying - he can lie to his bank and withdraw more money than what he has, cheat at casinos and gain lots of money. But he is the only one who knows how to lie. Everybody else takes what Mark says as gospel.Having achieved some measure of success, Mark manages to get a second date with the girl of his dreams. She still isn't attracted to him, doesn't want to have ""snub nosed fat kids"". The second date seems okay, but it is interrupted by Mark's mother's death. This (to me) is one of the most moving parts of the movie. His mother is terrified of dying, terrified of an eternity of ""nothingness"". To calm his mom, to allow her to have a peaceful death, Mark tells his mom of a wonderful place where you go after you die, where you see all the people you've loved that have died. You get a mansion. You're young, healthy, you can do what you want.Suddenly, Mark is extremely popular - everyone wants to hear what he has to say. He writes down his 10 things about religion and puts them on the back of a pizza box and reads them to the waiting crowd. Mark has managed to create an afterlife, a heaven, something for people to believe in and hope for.Of course, this causes a lot of problems. And Mark's DNA is still the same  even though he has become successful. And he can't lie to the Jennifer Garner character - the only one he can't lie to. And she's going to make a huge mistake, marrying Mark's work rival because he is a better genetic match for her.The movie resolves itself a little ""cute"" for me, but I did enjoy it.

You see, he lives in town, where everyone tells the truth all the time, no matter what.  Well, somehow, he starts telling lies, at first for his own good (to get money) and then to help people (feel better about their lives, etc.)  The lies soon catch up with him, after he's befriended a girl he's had a crush on for years, and ends up falling in love with her, and she's forced to make a decision that would ultimately change the direction of her life.  Good messages in the movie, about being kind, helping people, etc.However, the movie fell short on the writing.  It really needed a stronger script, better plot, better character development, better world building, and funnier comedy.  I've seen some of Ricky's stand up comedy shows, and the man is very funny with his odd whacked out sense of British humor.  Though I have never understood the U.S. show ""The Office"", just didn't think it was funny.  I haven't seen the British version (the one Ricky created) so I can't compare the two, or speak to his writing ability on that show.Obviously the cast include some pretty amazing names, who have done incredible work.  And if the cast are talented but if I don't like the characters, that leads me back to point my finger at poor or incomplete writing and development.

One day while sitting with his dying mother he discovers the ability to lie.  He then uses his new ability to take advantage of his totally honest world.  It really is a unique and interesting concept, and there is a cameo by tons of Hollywood stars throughout the movie.

He also happens to be in love with a beautiful, successful woman, who is much taller then he and has a pretty nose. And did I mention, they are all living in a Universe where everyone tells the truth, regardless of the consequences? It's not that they do not WANT to tell lies. It is that they are not capable of them. If fact, the word ""lie"" does not even exist in the vocabulary. And so, Mark's first date with his love Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner) is likely to be the last one, as she politely informs him he is too fat, poor and ugly to be a viable match for her and she's out with him only as a favour to a mutual friend. Back in the office, Mark's secretary tells him she is far better qualified for his job then he is. Prompted with a ""how are you?"", his neighbour shares he has been trying to find the best way to commit suicide and he maybe able to ""close the deal"" that night... Etc., etc.In fact, the entire first half of the film deals with setting up the ""lie free"" Universe. It also happens to be the better half. Smart and funny jokes come at you at a brisk pace while you smugly take credit for picking this film to see... However, as soon as the ""I TOLD you it was going to be good!"" rolls off your lips, something unexpected happens. Once Mark discovers how to lie and starts using the trick to help himself and others, his life picks up speed. But, the film slows down... It becomes unfunny and full of ethically and morally confusing messages. For example, while Mark encourages Anna to love him for who he is (which by now would be a liar, wouldn't it?), he himself spurns a woman simply based on her looks (which are on the same level as his). Each character's propensity for speaking their minds without any consideration for the feelings of others begins to grind us down. Everyone, including Mark and Anne, appears rude, heartless, and undeserving of our empathy and interest. This second half derails the film badly.After a considerable struggle with the rating, I am calling it ""OK"". While the first half of the film held a lot of promise, it was unfortunately never realized. However, there are still enough laughs in The Invention of Lying to make it quite watchable and entertaining. Mark's choices will provide food for thought and a topic for discussion after the film is over. If you want to see a comedy this weekend and zombies are not your thing, give The Invention of Lying a try!

1252991,A23W55M32D2AC,B00275EHBY,"Stephen Ashley ""Author of Walt Disney World w...","[3, 9]","I want to address the religious issue first. The premise for this movie is that in this world, the human brain does not have the connections needed for lying. It's not physically possible. Suddenly the main character played by Ricky Gervais' develops the connections and has the ability to lie. In this script, not only do the people of this world not have the ability to recognize a lie, they don't recognize mistakes. Anything anyone says is accepted as fact. So when Ricky Gervais says that he really has more in his bank account then he does, they give him the money without question.While his mother is dying she experiences terrible fear, and in an effort to give her peace, Gervais makes up a story about a heaven-like eternal place. Since the people in this alternate world have no knowledge of lying, his mom believes his story and so do the doctors. They and the world want to know more about this place, and Ricky creates ""the Man in the Sky"" and his rules.Many people of faith have taken offense by this, and see it as an attack against religion. I don't know the writer's intent (Gervais was one of the writers). Most likely they did mean to make religion seem like man's fantasy to gain comfort. On the other hand, it may have just been an attempt at humor from people who don't have any strong religious convictions.In the movie's alternative world, no one understands lying and no one questions anything anyone else says. When Gervais tells everyone about the Man in the Sky, no one doubts him. In the reality of our world, the bible has been completely questioned, studied and scrutinized for centuries. It has come through all this, and has proven accurate and dependable. It's been found to be historically, scientifically and prophetically accurate. (This book addresses that:The New Evidence That Demands A Verdict Fully Updated To Answer The Questions Challenging Christians TodaySo in essence, this movie doesn't discount religion in our real world, but only in this alternative world. However those who are weak in faith may take the ideas in this movie to heart, so I would not recommend it. Those who do have faith may just find it sad to see this type of story line and viewpoint from people who have no concept of what it's like to have the power and presence of God in their lives.Lastly, I do agree with the reviewer who said that the movie glorfies lying, and uglifies truth.

I am leaving the content descriptions/opinion to others as I have noticed each review becomes a discussion of religion and beliefs. The Blu clarity was standard throughout and the TrueHD holds normal for a comedy. There were really no reference points to talk about, and I admittedly had more fun watching the supplements than the film, they include: (all lodef)* The famous ""prequel"", 6:30 minutes. Watch this first as it allows the other supplements to make more sense. Patrick Stewart has a nice cameo narration here, and our entire cast performs a caveman routine that is almost funnier than the film.* Making of, 7:17 minutes. A great deal about Gervais' laugh, jokes on the set, fun stuff.* Karl Pilkington cave sequence, 17:48 minutes. You have to be a huge fan of Gervais and their style of writing for this. Covers the ""story"" behind one of their crew being cut from the deleted scene of the film, felt like an episode of the Office.* Podcasts, 4 totaling 10 minutes. Dry clips telling about their Nerf gun fights and set tours.* Additional scenes, 5 totaling 7 minutes. Glad most of them were cut.* Corpsing and outtakes, 5:34 minutes.

Regardless, knowing that Ricky Gervais was going to star in The Invention of Lying made it a must see film in my book.With theatrical release on 10/2/2009, I took my daughter and a couple of her friends to see the film The Invention of Lying over the weekend of its release.  I knew Ricky Gervais starred in the film, but hadn't realized that he also co-directed and co-wrote the film.I'm sure that Zombieland probably mopped the floor with Invention of... in box office returns, and must admit that I was tempted to see if my daughter would rather see that instead, but we stuck with our (my mostly, I think) first choice and saw Invention of Lying.To its credit, Invention of Lying is a PG-13 farce that looks at a world where everyone always tells the truth, with nearly brutal honesty. Rather than telling small lies that might lessen the pain that would be caused by being so honest, everyone always tells the truth, including commercial pitchmen advertising cola beverages (the ads for Coke and Pepsi that are in the film as product placement are very funny).While the film isn't a laugh a minute comedy, it is funny and it inspires thought and discussion as the newly lying-capable character tells a lie that literally takes the world by storm.If you aren't intending to see it in theatres, definitely add it to your wishlist and perhaps you'll be pleasantly surprised by it when you do catch it.",4,I'd be lying if I said it was perfect,1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,1792,"[""'ve"", 'liked', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'ever', 'catching', 'original', 'brit-com', 'version', 'Office', 'Office', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'BBC', 'Edition', 'First', 'Second', 'Series', 'Plus', 'Special', 'then', 'later', 'biting', 'satire', 'Extras', 'Extras', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Includes', 'Series', 'Finale', 'series', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'short', 'then', 'again', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'finale', 'perhaps', 'not', 'Regardless', 'knowing', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'was', 'going', 'star', 'Invention', 'Lying', 'made', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'book.With', 'theatrical', 'release', '10/2/2009', 'took', 'daughter', 'couple', 'friends', 'see', 'film', 'Invention', 'Lying', 'weekend', 'release', 'knew', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'starred', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'also', 'co-directed', 'co-wrote', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Zombieland', 'probably', 'mopped', 'floor', 'Invention', 'box', 'office', 'returns', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'tempted', 'see', 'daughter', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'instead', 'stuck', 'mostly', 'think', 'first', 'choice', 'saw', 'Invention', 'Lying.To', 'credit', 'Invention', 'Lying', 'PG-13', 'farce', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'always', 'truth', 'nearly', 'brutal', 'honesty', 'Rather', 'telling', 'small', 'lies', 'might', 'lessen', 'pain', 'would', 'be', 'caused', 'being', 'so', 'honest', 'everyone', 'always', 'truth', 'including', 'commercial', 'pitchmen', 'advertising', 'cola', 'beverages', 'ads', 'Coke', 'Pepsi', 'are', 'film', 'product', 'placement', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'film', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'minute', 'comedy', 'funny', 'thought', 'discussion', 'newly', 'lying-capable', 'character', 'lie', 'literally', 'world', 'storm.If', 'are', ""n't"", 'intending', 'see', 'theatres', 'definitely', 'add', 'wishlist', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'do', 'catch']",N/A
1252998,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B00275EHBY,Thomas Glebe,"[2, 3]","A lot of times, when checking out a movie I really hadn't heard anything about, I am more than pleasantly surprised.  And so it goes for this one.  I am amazed this didn't do much box office, and to this day has had very mixed reviews from a wide variety of different sources.  I'm not sure what to make of this, except that it's the kind of fantasy film one either doesn't quite ""get,"" or the kind of premise which the viewer never really quite buys into from the beginning.  I am/was neither.  I loved it the first time I saw it, and after repeated viewings, love it even more.There really is no way to even approach reviewing this movie without giving out at least a few spoilers, which I will try to keep to a minimum.  Seems there is this parallel universe of sorts, and a planet almost identical to our own, except for one major difference.  In the world of this film, there is no such thing as ""lying.""  Everyone tells the absolute truth about everything, from the most trivial matters, to ones sublime.  In fact, the very concept of not telling the truth, is an alien concept.  Seems it's just not hard-wired into people's brains and behavior.  All of this is just the way life is, until one day, our hero Mark Bellison (played by comedian Ricky Gervais, who also co-wrote and directed the film), a frustrated and soon to be fired and evicted screenwriter, has something snap deep inside his brain, and tells the first ""lie"" in history.  Things proceed rapidly from that point onward, and so begins a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs for Mark.Mark becomes almost instantly famous and rich from his discovery of ""lying,"" but none of it really means much in the way of his personal happiness, because despite how he can effortlessly manipulate the world and people around him, his newfound success cannot save his sick, dying mother, nor win him the heart of an attractive co-worker Anna (played by Jennifer Garner) who he's had a crush on for years.  Anna in fact, ""cares"" a great deal for Mark, but sees love in a strictly practical way, and worries more about the physical beauty of any offspring she might have than about being true to her own deep feelings.  She even goes as far as planning to marry the handsome but superficial Brad (played by Rob Lowe), who shows no true regard for either her or Mark.Getting too much further into what exactly transpires along the way, would be giving away too many details to those who haven't seen this yet.  What I can say, is that from the opening credits and first few scenes, I personally was hooked.  There are wonderful surprises throughout, both funny and sad, minor and profound, and the attention to details is incredible.  It is this last quality that gives the movie, for me at least, its greatness and re-watchability.  In other words, if you like this, it's a film you'll probably want to own.The direction is good although happily unobtrusive, as over-directing this could've ruined the whole effect.  Various other celebrities appear, with special kudos for Jeffrey Tambor, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill and especially Louis C.K., but the down to earth performances of Gervais and Garner truly shine.  This is essentially a love story, but in a strange, strange world.  It is also a big positive that this is not drenched in hit pop songs every few minutes, as so many films seem smothered with these days, but what music there is, really works well.For such a weird world where nobody except Mark lies, nor even understands the very concept, the film is marvelously consistent.  That is no small task, as in lesser and less capable hands, none of this would've really worked.  And while Mark's little (and bigger) lies create many memorable moments within the reality of this other world, there are some pretty deep comments here about our real society, and what unfortunately seems ""valued"" by most.  Finally, I must confess that I most enjoyed the moments when Mark's untruths eventually make him a prophet of sorts, and the sharp and unashamed jabs at ""religion"" in general and unquestioning belief systems in particular, make for a most enjoyable, and very, very unique movie experience.I'm not that much of a Ricky Gervais fan, although I've always enjoyed his stand-up comedy routines.  I still do not quite know why this film did not win over more people at release and to this day gets some bad or mediocre reviews.  What I do know is that it's a truly unique movie and unbelievably well done, and that this in itself is a very rare thing these days, movie-wise.

1252999,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00275EHBY,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[8, 37]","Ricky Gervais is a brilliant comedian. You don't really need me to you that, you only need to watch the original version of ""The Office"" to see this. In addition to creating the memorable lead of this British television series, he and his longtime creative partner, Stephen Merchant, created the series, crafting an ensemble of memorable, very original and very funny characters. He was almost as good on the series ""Extras"". But he has had some difficulty transitioning to the role of movie star; he has appeared in a number of memorable supporting roles, but his two leading performances, so far, have been problematic, forgettable and pretty darn bad.In ""Ghost Town"", he plays a dentist who has a near death experience and starts to see ghosts. One of these ghosts, played by Greg Kinnear, uses him to communicate with his wife, played by Tea Leoni, in an effort to prevent her from marrying a bad guy, played by Billy Campbell. The film is amusing and even funny at times, but the story is too high concept and Gervais is too low key to match the story. In the end, the result is little better than the dramedies populating the many television channels on your Direct TV satellite.In his new film, ""The Invention of Lying"", Gervais again stars, this time as Mark Bellison, a struggling film writer, who lives in a typical small town on the East Coast of a very different America. In this America, no one lies, so conversations are uncomfortably awkward and movies are uncommonly dull. This time, Gervais has teamed with Matthew Robinson to co-write and co-direct. Robinson has no other credits listed on IMDB.com, so I am not sure where he came from.Initially, the idea holds potential. As Bellison walks through town, we see some pretty honest advertisements. A billboard for Coca Cola announces that it is basically brown coloring, water and sugar. Another billboard for Pepsi announces, ""When you can't find a Coke"". These are amusing and instantly give us a picture of what this universe holds for us.The film opens with Bellison headed to the apartment of Anna (Jennifer Garner). They are to go on a first date together. When she answers the door, she immediately voices her true feelings about Mark, the date, and his chances of having sex with her. They go to a little Italian place for dinner and the waiter immediately voices his feelings for Anna. He also states that he took a sip of the drink he is now serving her. And this continues.Mark is having trouble at work. Bellison works for a movie company that basically films lecturers giving an oral history of a significant event or time period.Each of the writers has been assigned a specific time period and Mark has difficulty making anything interesting out of the Black Plague and the other subjects he has to work with. Because of this, his films have not been successful and he learns he will probably be fired. When he arrives at work, his secretary (Tina Fey) happily passes on this information, along with her true feelings of him. As he sits in his office, he watches his boss (Jeffrey Tambor) walk by and stop for a second and then continue on before walking by again. Mark stops him and has to almost fire himself.Mark's main rival, Brad Kessler (Rob Lowe) is having a phenomenal run of success. People are flocking to the films he makes, anxious to watch the lecturer (Christopher Guest) sit in a chair and relate the details of a historical event. Mark doesn't like Brad and Brad takes every opportunity to rub his success in Mark's face.The next day, the landlord shows up and wants the rent. But Mark doesn't have it. He goes to his bank and wants to withdraw the money he has, but makes a sarcastic comment about how he 'would really like $800'. The teller assumes there has been a mistake and gives him the $800 instead. Mark has just invented a very valuable skill.There are a lot of problems with ""The Invention of Lying"". An interesting idea quickly becomes flat when it becomes the only idea. Yes, there are variations on the theme, but it is essentially a one-note film. The first few times people spout their true feelings about someone or something, it takes us by surprise, shocking out a laugh. But people don't talk as much as they do in ""Lying""; they don't stop and psychoanalyze their feelings with every thought. Does not talking about your feelings make you a liar? That seems to be the idea behind a lot of this film because people immediately start telling others how they really feel as soon as they come together.Something just occurred to me. There are more than a few moments when people say things like ""I have always loathed working for you"". Yet, through a lot of the film, people immediately tell their feelings and first impressions about someone when they first meet. If this is the practice in this world, why is someone just now saying ""I have always loathed working for you""? It doesn't seem like the narrative can and should have it both ways.Also, a lot of these 'truths"" people voice are based on first impressions and that makes the characters seem shallow and mean. Certainly not likable or innocent. Because we don't really care about anyone in the film, we quickly lose interest.Eventually, Mark learns of a way to get his job back and to become a very successful film writer. He starts to tell stories, to embellish the truth and creates something much more similar to the film we are watching. But when people ask where this information is coming from, because they aren't aware of the skill of lying, Mark states that he talks to The Man Upstairs. This leads to a number of the characters trying to get Mark to introduce them to The Man Upstairs and this leads to some obvious parodies aimed at organized religion. An idea that quickly becomes tiresome because they just aren't that original or interesting.A lot of the problems in ""Lying"" come from Gervais portrayal of Bellison. He spends a lot of the film reacting to others and giving the appearance of being aggravated or annoyed with others. Are we to believe that Bellison is the only one in the world frustrated with this situation? Everyone else seems to accept it when people instantly tell their impressions to a person they have just met, or to update the status of their feelings during a date. But Mark seems to receive a fare share of highly critical remarks and observations, which are funny at first, but just seem to become more and more mean spirited as the story progresses. And he is frustrated about this. After Mark turns this situation to his advantage and starts to become a success, his persona seems to change and he seems to start regarding others with frustration. As in ""How can you be so dumb..."" Again, this is funny, briefly, in the beginning, but again, quickly becomes tiresome.The other big problem with ""Lying"" is Jennifer Garner who plays Anna. She is just plain awful throughout the film. Immediately, her character states that she doesn't hold any hope for the date because Mark doesn't make enough money and the likelihood they will have sex on the first date is slim because Mark is fat and unattractive. Anna starts out as an extremely unlikable character. This isn't a bad thing, if there is some sort of metamorphosis throughout the story. But she doesn't change at all. Later, she becomes interested in Brad, because he is ""good looking"", successful, and wealthy. Everything she is. Everything she wants and should have. In other words, Mark is not up to her standards and Brad is.Garner seems to think that Anna should be portrayed as Marilyn Monroe might portray the character. She talks in a seductive whisper and smiles a lot. Yet, she doesn't succeed at bringing Anna any smarts, she only makes Anna seem vapid and insecure.Tina Fey is only in the film for a few minutes. As soon as Mark appears at work, she tells him that he is about to get fired and states ""I have always loathed working for you"". Again, how can the narrative have it both ways? If people are so quick to tell their impressions of people to them, why has it taken her character so long?Rob Lowe is just plain creepy as Brad Kessler. Louis C.K., Jonah Hill, Fionula Flanagan and others pop up in equally unmemorable roles and don't really seem to understand what they are doing.""The Invention of Lying"" is a film that goes very wrong, very quickly and can't recover.Skip it.

1253003,A2U9X230VFNAA6,B00275EHBY,William Maudlin,"[2, 24]","My wife and I went to see this new Ricky Gervais movie on the strength of Ghost Town which we loved.We were sadly disappointed.  There were about 15 to 20 in the Saturday afternoon showing at our local film theater.  Four walked out after giving it what they must have felt was a fair shot. Others of us stayed to the bitter end.  There was one young woman in the audience who was giggling the whole way through but she was a minority of one, though there was some occasional laughter, not thigh-slapping stuff, but slightly amused tokens of appreciation.The idea for the movie is great. We looked to see some depth but saw and heard only the banal and grovelling.From the beginning you know that Gervais's opinon of people is low.  His character goes to pick up a girl for a date.  Her spoken ""honest"" thoughts, when she answered the door were that he had interrupted her  masturbating and she was going upstairs to finish this activity.  Then she would go out with him but she didn't really like him.  Other characters seem to have nothing on their mind but the sensual too.  There was little of nobility, kindness, originality or virtue.  It was a sad and, to some extent I am sure, false indictment of society.It could have been so much more but failed to fulfill its promise.  So if you liked Ghost Town, which was clever and largely free from vulgarity of any kind, you may find that this one will lower your opinion of Gervais as it did ours.  We will think twice about seeing any future movies of his.  We bought ""Ghost Town"" though and aim to see it occasionally in memory of what Ricky Gervais can be.",1,Good Idea: Terrible Execution,1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,1611,"['wife', 'went', 'see', 'new', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'movie', 'strength', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'loved.We', 'were', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'were', 'about', '15', '20', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'showing', 'local', 'film', 'theater', 'Four', 'walked', 'out', 'giving', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'was', 'fair', 'shot', 'Others', 'stayed', 'bitter', 'end', 'was', 'one', 'young', 'woman', 'audience', 'who', 'was', 'giggling', 'whole', 'way', 'was', 'minority', 'one', 'was', 'occasional', 'laughter', 'not', 'thigh-slapping', 'stuff', 'slightly', 'amused', 'tokens', 'appreciation.The', 'idea', 'movie', 'great', 'looked', 'see', 'depth', 'saw', 'heard', 'only', 'banal', 'grovelling.From', 'beginning', 'know', 'Gervais', 'opinon', 'people', 'low', 'character', 'pick', 'up', 'girl', 'date', 'spoken', 'honest', 'thoughts', 'when', 'answered', 'door', 'were', 'had', 'interrupted', 'masturbating', 'was', 'going', 'upstairs', 'finish', 'activity', 'Then', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'Other', 'characters', 'seem', 'have', 'nothing', 'mind', 'sensual', 'too', 'was', 'little', 'nobility', 'kindness', 'originality', 'virtue', 'was', 'sad', 'extent', 'am', 'sure', 'false', 'indictment', 'society.It', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'failed', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'So', 'liked', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'was', 'clever', 'largely', 'free', 'vulgarity', 'kind', 'may', 'find', 'one', 'will', 'lower', 'opinion', 'Gervais', 'did', 'ours', 'will', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'seeing', 'future', 'movies', 'bought', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'aim', 'see', 'occasionally', 'memory', 'what', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'can', 'be']",N/A
