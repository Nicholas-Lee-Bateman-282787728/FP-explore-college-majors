I was hearing its terrible to many story lines same old saw and wow they closed storylines from the last movie and it is put together to have another successful one. In my opinion this saw movie delivered big time and now in the series ranks as the second best one ever behind saw 2 for me. One thing the critics had right was there was a lot of stuff to follow but at the same time they closed up stories from the past movies and did a great job making sure you weren't confused. One thing I always like about the saw movies is they start the movie up with one of the torture scenes and it always leads into the movie. They did not focus as much on the killings as they did of creating a new storyline and trust me when you see what happens it will leave you scratching your head. Overall I really liked the killing scenes as the traps were unique and different from the last time. Also the ending is perfect and the best of all the saw movies as it will leave you wanting to come back for more saw.

1213959,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B001L9EXU2,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[7, 10]","I was never interested in the Saw series for the gore. I don't think it's particularly more so than the previous ones, but it just happens to be in methods we haven't seen before, and so it may seem gorier.The story is basely simple, yet starts stranding together intricate threads, sealing some plot holes from the previous films, and creating new ones destined to be filled by the next sequel.Special Agent Strahm survived, and is out to discover why Hoffman is the only agent of the investigation on Jigsaw to escape alive and unharmed. Strahm was meant to die, but survived in a gross way via a trap which was possibly explained off-camera, but on-camera was given no explanation save for an execution.I was angry at the opening trap, in which a man must crush his hands or else a pendulum blade will cut him in half. Aside from the sheer impossibility of surviving such a trap (crushing his hands would probably kill him from the shock, or he'd bleed to death before he could get help), the trap is not a ""trap"", but a murder device designed by Hoffman as revenge on the murderer of his sister. Despite the guy carrying through with crushing his hands, the pendulum doesn't stop and kills him. Later on, it's revealed this took place during Jigsaw's traps, and was a copycat made by Hoffman to kill this man and blame it on Jigsaw. This is how Jigsaw catches Hoffman, and basically forces him to carry on his work.The main trap of the movie is, I think, an infinitely more sophisticated version of the multi-person trap in Saw II. The brilliance of it is that Jigsaw's message gives a double-meaning (""five must become one"" which could imply the five of them working together as one, or four of them dying), and then clearly states what he intends (""Your lifelong instincts will tell you to do one thing, but I implore you; do the opposite""). By which he means he wants them all to work together in every trap. At first glance, they all seem to be designed to kill one of them off with each one, and yet they are clearly designed with the ulterior motive of having ALL of them survive, if they think to work together.But of course, this being a Saw movie, they don't bother to listen.The penultimate trap disturbed me worse than any other trap in the movie, involving filling a beaker with blood to open a door. Since it was designed for five people, the two people remaining have to bleed more to open it. However it was designed, it was impossible for these two to do it. They have to stick their hands into a blade, which cuts their hands and wrists in half vertically. Absolutely no chance of surviving this---that old joke ""down the road, not across the street"" of wrist-cutting would apply here, as they would simply bleed to death. It makes for a fun visual if you enjoy gore, but it only sickened me and made me hate these two for actually trying to carry it out. They failed as soon as they started killing one another.For Agent Strahm hunting Agent Hoffman, it plays out in a way that is not particularly brilliant, but still a bit entertaining.  The last trap is indeed a spectacular one, which in typical ""Saw"" fashion, could have been easily avoided if Strahm just listened to ""Jigsaw"" on the tape (It was Hoffman's voice on the tape rather than John Kramer).  But since it's a Saw movie, he doesn't.As a whole, the movie is not the weakest of the series (I still consider Saw II to be that), but it's clearly one of the weakest. It had strokes of genius, and kept true to Saw tradition, in that no subplot, or seemingly random string of dialogue is ever a red herring or throwaway---everything is connected to the other Saw movies in some profound way. There's even a new mystery to make you wait for the next movie.However, the main failing of this movie; the main reason why I consider it less than its predecessors, is that because the films are seemingly moving at a breakneck pace, they can't predict who will take center stage in the next film.Because of this, Agent Strahm was only in Saw IV, and was little more than ""Guy Trailing Jigsaw"". The major string of Saw V hinges completely on us caring about Agent Strahm as a major character; he is supposed to be for Saw V what Detective Matthews was for Saw II, Saw III, and Saw IV---someone given enough time for the audience to not only care about, but to sympathize with, identify with, and begin speculating wildly as to their role in the next film.It may not seem like much, but it was sufficient character development to make Matthews a solid entry into the ""Saw"" franchise. Saw IV did not do this for Strahm, and Saw V stumbles badly because of it. Saw V wants Agent Strahm to be its Detective Matthews, but Strahm is not.The big tag-line ""You won't believe how it ends!"" is indeed a huge letdown; The ending is very believable.",3,"Not the worst,

However, I disagree as the story is further explained between Jigsaw and Hoffman. The story of Hoffman begins and truly the person that he really is, is what eventually gives way in VI and The Final Chapter. Picking up right where III/IV left off (both events occured concurrently), detective Hoffman looks to be the only survivor and hero of the Jigsaw murders. However, agent Straum who barely managed to escape his own death without Hoffmans knowledge is alive. Hoffman goes on the offense and sets a game in motion to only lure Straum into another life or death scenario and to be set up as the other apprentice. The ending does live up to the tagline cause I didn't see it coming. I really wanted for Straum to live because he would be the one who could step up to Hoffman and stop him dead in his tracks.

1213969,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001L9EXU2,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 3]","I can't help but recall something I said in my review for last year's ""Saw IV"": ""I know that next Halloween will see the release of `Saw V.' I also know that when one of the characters says, `Game over,' at the end of the film, the story will continue."" To my surprise, I never once heard anyone say, ""Game over,"" in ""Saw V."" But that doesn't matter. The fact that I knew there would be a fifth film says plenty. As was the case with Jason Voorhees, Freddy Kruger, and Michael Myers, the people behind the ""Saw"" franchise are milking the Jigsaw character for all he's worth, forcing him to appear in sequel after sequel after sequel. No one seems to realize that the cow went dry a long time ago, even before Jigsaw officially died. Is there any point in making sequels featuring a dead character? And why should it matter that others will be there to carry the legacy? If the filmmakers followed every person that followed in Jigsaw's footsteps, the sequels would never end. That, my friends, is the real horror.""Saw V,"" as with all its predecessor, features a number of elaborate death devices. It begins with a man named Seth (Joris Jarsky) strapped to a table, facing his doom in a trap that pays homage to Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Pit and the Pendulum."" Later on in the film, Agent Peter Strahm (Scott Patterson) awakens with his head trapped inside a glass box, one that quickly begins filling with water (you don't want to know what he does to sustain his breath). And then we meet five people imprisoned in a sewer, each one tethered at the neck; I won't reveal how the trap works or what circumstances tie the people together, but I will say that they're forced to go through a series of traps in a specific period of time, each more gruesome than the last. As Billy the Puppet tells them, ""Today, five people will become one with the goal of surviving."" Has anyone but me wondered how Jigsaw--or anyone else--had the time, the money, and the resources to build these preposterous devices? It seems too labor-intensive and technical for someone who (a) was not an engineer and (b) was sick with cancer.The basic plot focuses on Jigsaw's apprentice, forensics expert Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), trying to cover his tracks. Much of the film is told in flashback, specifically in scenes featuring Hoffman and Jigsaw, a.k.a. John Kramer (Tobin Bell). When they first meet, Kramer ties Hoffman to a chair rigged with a shotgun; if Hoffman moves the wrong way, a string will pull the trigger. But apparently, the point is to get Hoffman to see that everyone, no matter what they have done, deserves the same chance at life, or as Kramer puts it, rehabilitation. Most of the flashbacks begin during Strahm's scenes, which I find interesting since he has no knowledge of what Jigsaw and Hoffman said to one another. Is there a narrative link I'm missing here, or is this just bad storytelling?And while we're on the subject, what was the purpose of including Kramer's widow, Jill (Betsy Russell)? She appears so infrequently, and what's worse, she teases the audience with a series of red herrings. She's given a box her husband had set aside in the event of his death; while she's allowed to look inside the box, the audience is not. Later in the film, she seeks the help of a police officer named Dan Erickson (Mark Rolston) when she claims that someone is following her. Nothing much comes of it. I can only hope the filmmakers are saving the explanations for the next film.Let me take a moment to discuss the ending. The tagline for this is film is, ""You won't believe how it ends."" The implication is that the ending reveals something that's shocking and unexpected, as would be the case in an M. Night Shyamalan film. Boy, was I in for an unpleasant surprise--if this is what the filmmakers consider a clever plot twist, I'd hate to think how they define an anticlimax. What was I supposed to find so unbelievable? What was supposed to come out of left field? Did I miss something? Why am I even asking these questions? Not too many people will care one way or another, which is annoying because it will only result in more sequels. It's bad enough that we're inundated with an endless string of remakes, many of which are taken from foreign cinema.I wonder how many more reviews like this I'm going to write. I'm starting to sympathize with the critics who had to endure eight ""Halloweens"" and ten ""Friday the 13ths"" and seven ""Nightmare on Elm Streets"" and one film that combined the last two. Early franchise entries might be fun to watch, but by the time you reach your fourth or fifth sequel, enough really is enough. I don't see how any writer or director can continue this storyline and maintain the same level of mystery, suspense, and originality. ""Saw VI"" is already slated for release, naturally, and as far as I know, Tobin Bell has signed on. I wonder how he feels knowing he's playing a dead character. How many more flashback scenes will it take to cover everything we haven't already been told about Jigsaw? How many more apprentices will carry his legacy? Here's a better question: How long will it take for fans to finally get sick of the ""Saw"" series? Another three films? Four? Five? And how long are they willing to wait before a new director decides to remake them? ""Saw V"" represents a depressing decline in the horror genre, which has been corrupted by producers wanting to make a profit. These movies should be striving for scares, not for money.",2,This Game Needs a Time Out,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,5480,"['ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'recall', 'something', 'said', 'review', 'last',

1213971,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B001L9EXU2,Christopher Engel,"[0, 1]","The first three Saw film weren't bad. They weren't exactly classics, but they weren't bad. After the third ended and Jigsaw died, apparently someone decided to really go for something and continue the whole Saw series anyway. What we get is a disastrous hodgepodge of bizarre plot twists, ridiculous new characters, poorly designed ""traps"" that come nowhere near as entertaining as the earlier ones, and worst of all, they try to add depth to John, also known as Jigsaw.Look, Jigsaw was never scary. Ever. Nor was he profound in any way. He was even less scary with that totally ridiculous clown mask, and even more comical with the pig mask. If those were genuinely meant to be frightening, they had the exact opposite effect. The laughing doll on the tricycle was beyond stupid, and John's antihero motives were, to put it in a word, absurd. The writers continued to run with John somehow being deep or intelligent or somehow unique and worth following, and they failed so miserably that V makes sure not to make up for the catastrophic failure that was IV.So, here we are again. If IV wasn't bad enough with the flashbacks and completely unnecessary backstory behind Jigsaw and some other characters that we could not care less about, V amps it up. Now we get more about his wife, the detectives, some more random flesh to blow up, and, worst of all, an attempt at adding meaning to the story, which turned into a dismal failure that grated on everyone's nerves. No one ever cared in the slightest about John, anything about him, his ""antivillain"" persona, or anyone related to him in any way. We simply do not care, and none of the Saw films after III succeeded in what they tried to do, which was to add depth to an already-ridiculous story. John still comes off as an insensible weirdo, everything is still mind-numbingly implausible, the ""twists"" are completely meaningless (especially for a series in which we never cared in the slightest about the story and just wanted to see the goddamned traps--this is a horror film, not a thriller, despite its best efforts), and nothing really changes. In-between trap scenes, we get all these flashbacks of the past Saw films with more context added. Why? Really, why? Who watched these films and thought the story had any potential to be something to be taken seriously? One person? No one?V doesn't learn one bit from its mistakes with IV, and continues to run with the story, despite the fact that Jigsaw is dead, but somehow not dead, and also somehow has accomplices now. Really, the writers just had to come up with *something*, so this is the end result, but come on. I never watched another Saw film after this one, just because I knew I was going to get more of the same childish nonsense that takes itself seriously in-between terribly lame and boring traps. Backstory's the name of the game in V, and the fact still remains that it's boring, stupid, shallow, and Jigsaw is just not interesting, scary, profound, or in any way notable--just his traps. John is actually quite grating with his constant monologues of ""rehabilitating"" people with his traps, claiming not to be murderer, but do any of us believe for a second that his motives are what we care about? Why would anyone care? He's just some guy with a warped philosophy of how to ""rehabilitate"" criminals, drug dealers, rapists, or otherwise morally questionable people.We. Do. Not. Care. Not about John, not about his wife, not about a single character that has ever existed in Saw who we're just assumed to care about. No one does. Why should we? The film doesn't bother with that part--the fact that they're connected to Jigsaw is apparently good enough. Well, no, it isn't, actually. Jigsaw is a ridiculous villain, a boring serial killer with childish ideas of morality, a completely not-scary persona, and that same mask he's been using since the beginning which has never once instilled the slightest fear in anyone who's at all familiar with well-designed horror villains. Even Freddy Krueger, through nearly ten Nightmare on Elm Street films, didn't bother that much with his backstory, because his backstory was never important. We just wanted to see him kill people in the dreams he created for them. That's it. The same goes for Jigsaw--we just want to see the traps. We don't care about who's doing it, because that's a moot point unless it's something really, really special. John is not special. He's boring and stupid. Just get to the freaking traps.If IV wasn't bad enough, V just ignores everything that was wrong with it and keeps going with the insensible story and its trademark deep green color that seem to glow on every single object there is. It's not scary or suspenseful in any way, and V is the most boring one I've seen, as well as the most insulting, since I never got past this one, doubting they could make up for this new direction they were going in just for the sake of continuing the series.Saw V fails on every single count. It's not as gory as the previous installments, the traps are boring, the characters are boring, the entire story is boring, the ""twists"" are beyond stupid and also meaningless, and the film tries the whole time to be something it can never be, as something intellectual on some level. We're supposed to feel something for John for some reason, despite that he's just not interesting, and, you know, we already saw him die once after the trilogy ended. Where do you go after that? Well, this film thinks the best course of action is to just add a lot of meaningless details in a mindless effort to allow for a new one next year. Terrible on any standard, and a yawn-inducing horror film, and a film that's meant to keep you on the edge of your seat that instead just keeps you checking your watch wondering when it's going to end definitely has a problem. Well, here you go, the continuation of the downward spiral of Saw's ability to entertain even shock-horror fans. Having never seen the sequels past this one, I can only imagine how those went, but V has officially stopped my involvement in a franchise that should have never continued past III.Just

1213972,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B001L9EXU2,Dave. K,"[0, 0]","It seems everyone bashes the Saw franchise, but yet when the original came out a lot of people seemed to like it, but once the mass got hold of it and it turned into a franchise suddenly the cool thing to do is bash the series. But with the amount of money the Saw franchise is making a lot more people like it than willing to admit. The Saw franchise is this generations Friday the 13th; while the Friday the 13th movies are a bit more mindless (nothing wrong with that), but both feature a little more violence than other horror flicks of their time and like in the 80s almost every year there was a new Friday the 13th movie since Saw came out in 2004 each year has had a new sequel.Going into Saw V I did have low expectations; I really enjoyed Saw and I thought Saw II is one of the few sequels that totally lives up to the original and in some ways outdoes it. But in my opinion after Saw II there really wasn't much of a direction left to go and while Saw III wasn't bad it just suffered from offering nothing new and more importantly was much longer of a film than it needed to be. Saw IV was nothing more than a rehash, but flowed better than Saw III and, while far from great I did enjoy Saw IV.But Saw V was actually quite a nice surprise and while it offers nothing new and is pretty much a rehash of the previous parts, but yet I thought it worked well overall. Saw V is far from a classic, but it could have been a disaster, but turned out alright. By this point in the series I suppose nothing new can be done since you cannot stray from the formula; you just make the best possible film and hope for the best.Patrick Melton & Marcus Dunstan wrote Saw IV and return to write Saw V; overall the script was good the characters were alright and mostly under developed, but when all is said and done they serve their purpose. The script does feel like a rewrite of past Saw movies with characters either not developed or just a rehash of past characters. The Saw flicks always try and stay one step ahead of the audience, which isn't a bad thing, but things can get a little too complex and to further the series we keep getting back-stories, which works, but feels a little forced. Despite the characters being a little weak or a rehash Melton & Dunstan get the job done overall and I suppose at this point wrote the best screenplay that could be written. Not many movies with the number V after them are very good, so despite some shortcomings the script gets the job done.David Hackl makes his directorial debut taking over for Darren Lynn Bousman who directed Saw II-IV. Hackl previously served as Production Designer on Saw II-IV and 2nd unit director on Saw III & IV. What David Hackl does is pretty much follows what Darren Lynn Bousman did, but thankfully the quick edits weren't done as much. Hackl never really injects anything of his own in the movie. Had Darren Lynn Bousman's name been listed as director you wouldn't even know it wasn't true.But despite that David Hackl still makes a film far better than it should have been. The pacing of the film works well and is mostly moving forward and the gore scenes play out well and Hackl keeps the story from getting too complicated. Saw V may not be a masterpiece of the genre, but David Hackl makes a film that is far better than it should have been and overall gets the job done. The suspense and tension is lacking a bit, but that has more to do with the formula getting stale rather than the direction.The traps were pretty good and the Pendulum trap just might rate as one of my favorite if not favorite trap of the Saw franchise. Saw V delivers the goods with the gore and is pretty gruesome at timesSaw V should work well with fans of the franchise, but the rest of you are better off skipping.

1213974,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B001L9EXU2,David J. Brown,"[2, 4]","Wow, I saw this movie the same night as Max Payne and I was shocked at how much they have in common.  No, not actors or tones or even genres, but that they are both utterly predicatable in less than twenty minutes of viewing.First, let me say I'm a huge fan of Saw.  Parts three and four had issues in over-plotting and just plain being overstuffed, but they basically worked in their grusome ways.  This one is not so lucky.  It's surprising too because the screenwriters previously wrote four, which was their first foray into Saw, but already seem dried up and out of ideas.  Leigh and Wan penned the previous three and still seemed fresh.  These guys are only on their second!  Basically every twist in this flick can be seen a mile away. *SPOILERS* As soon as you meet the five trapped people and they are told to go against their natures, and they start knocking each other off to get to the next trap, you know that they were supposed to work together.  Which is a nice sentiment to have in a modern horror movie.  Work together, no matter the gender, religion or race.  Whatever.  Detective Stahmer, oh where do I start with you?  Firstly, the actor, don't remember his name, is terrible in this movie.  He wasn't very good in part IV, but he had less screen time.  There are scenes where he actually recites exposition out loud to himself about the unraveling mystery that are absolutely hysterical.  You just want to yell at the screen, ""Um hey, I just watched the moving pictures that told us that!  We get it!""  This is still a visual medium, right?  You know, movies?  Even worse than his performance is where he is lead in the climax.  Having seen four previous Saw films you know he's not getting Hoffman, and you know the trap he doesn't get inside of will be the reason he dies and Hoffman lives.  Didn't the main character in the last flick have a similar fate?Plus, the traps aren't even interesting anymore.  The only one worth mentioning is the second one, The Box Trap, and that's only because the way the main character solves it was slightly unexpected, and kind of cool in it's grusome way.  Sure, there's nasty violence and gore, but so what?  Is it still that impressive, to anyone?  Is there any kind of graphic violence in this film that hasn't been seen before over the last 28 years or longer?  Nope, and the fact that the plot is so uninvolving and the characters so bland it's even harder to give a crap about whether anyone lives or dies.On the good side Tobin Bell shows up for his requisite flashbacks.  The effects are gross and realistic looking, even though the traps themselves are more cartoony and Rube-Goldberg like(Hmm, maybe they should pick up where Jaws 3-D failed and make the next Saw film a parody.  Admit it, you would've much rather seen Jaws 3, People 0 than to ever watch Jaws 3-D again) but fairly creative in their look.  The thing I miss the most was what the earlier films had.  They made the audience believe they could be caught in these traps, to a degree with a dash of suspension of disbelief, and the films also made you think about what you would do if you were in the situation.  The jaw trap from the first film springs to mind.Basically, the only thing this movie has to offer the Saw saga(that's pretty funny) is it explains the detective Hoffman plot hole from Saw IV.  You find out why this detective is in on it, and fairly well enough why Jigsaw seems to have so many allies.  The movie is predictable, boring, uninspired, and leaves enough open ends for Saw VI, which will involve a killer Jigsaw wife, or something along those lines, unless the writers woke up and decided to surprise me again.PS: Fun fact-torture porn is a term of endearment created by a writer who enjoys horror films, and was looking for a funny way to describe the new wave of ultra violent ones emerging amongst the sea of remakes and PG-13 Tiger-Beat fair.  Yeah, the term is now used in a negative light by the morons who still blame movies for the country's woes. The term was originally used to examine and ask why horror had suddenly become more violent.  Could it be the war? Waterboarding? Angry Muslims beheading soldiers on the internet?  Yes, people art, and yes movies, horror movies reflect the current world.  It doesn't point it in a direction it's not already headed in.  We should take the term 'torture porn' back and remove the negativity wrongly attached to it.

I've been a fan since the original came out and they are all really tremendous movies.You know, it's not about the amount of gore or lack there of, no; it's about a good storyline which I feel that the entire Saw line possesses and that is why they are currently making the 6th installment as you read this!Without revealing anything too in depth about the film (Don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen it) I can tell you that this Saw does a good job of tying the first two Saws together. We are finding out more and more about Jigsaw and how the traps are done and what went into them.Any Saw fan will love this movie and I for one cannot wait to add it to my DVD collection. If you didn't like Saw 1 or the fact that there is gore then you will not like this movie either. It isn't gore just for gore's sake ... it really contributes to the storyline and if you look deeper and realize why these people are in the traps and why Jigsaw does what he does then you will realize that there really is more to Saw then just blood and gore!",5,SAW 5 ... another horrifyingly good film!,1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,1188,"['THIS', 'REVIEW', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'NOT', 'THE', 'DVD', '-I', 'went', 'see', 'Saw', '5', 'theater', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'really', 'happy', 'went', 'see', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'original', 'came', 'out', 'are', 'really', 'tremendous', 'movies.You', 'know', 'not', 'amount', 'gore', 'lack', 'there', 'good', 'storyline', 'feel', 'entire', 'Saw', 'line', 'possesses', 'why', 'are', 'currently', 'making', '6th', 'installment', 'read', 'revealing', 'anything', 'too', 'depth', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'can', 'tell', 'Saw', 'good', 'job', 'tying', 'first', 'two', 'Saws', 'together', 'are', 'finding', 'more', 'more', 'Jigsaw', 'how', 'traps', 'are', 'done', 'what', 'went', 'them.Any', 'Saw', 'fan', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Saw', '1', 'fact', 'gore', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'either', ""n't"", 'gore', 'just', 'gore', 'sake', 'really', 'storyline', 'look', 'deeper', 'realize', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'traps', 'why', 'Jigsaw', 'what', 'then', 'will', 'realize', 'really', 'more', 'Saw', 'then', 'just', 'blood', 'gore']",N/A

First off, I just recently found out that SAW III and SAW IV were running together but SAW V doesn't run in between them but it does give us an over view of what has happened since the first SAW movie and who has been involved with John Kramer, and how he manipulates people into helping him. Defiled Horror mentioned something about an extended version. I've looked through all, and I haven't been able to see any. Please enlighten me. As for the box, I believe it's got information on Hoffman in it, but a said we'll have to wait for SAW VI to see, just like we all had to wait and see what was in that envelope for Amanda. In response to Andariel Halo, I thought that the suspense was handled very well with the pendulum trap. At first we thought it was a trap set up by Jigsaw, but then when Seth didn't escape, we then thought it may have been set up by Amanda because of her inescapable traps, but then we learn later about Hoffman's sister and then the pieces of the puzzle start to fit together. I thought that the end was interesting, but it still leaves the autopsy of John to ponder. Unless it's going to start off SAW VI after Hoffman is found, because in SAW V Hoffman was found with Jeff's daughter Corbett but they never brought out John Kramer, Amanda, Jeff Reinhart or Lynn Denlon's bodies.

The endless sequels tarnished its reputation somewhat, but this, the fifth (or perhaps this should be Vth) is the absolute lowest, lowest point of the franchise. Saw II was boring as hell and featured moronic characters that deserved to die. Saw III, which I believed was pushing its luck, wasn't any better. Saw IV only offered the flipside of the story from Saw III. All were burdened with epileptic seizure editing and fake-tography.Despite being stone cold dead, Jiggy's work is being carried on by mental cop Detective Hoffman who could actually bore people to death instead by being such a crap character. The guy has one facial expression. Five people are trapped in a yadda yadda yadda...blood, dismemberment, CGI gore effects, blah, blah, blah. If I were in that giant trap I would have gotten free without a scratch since there are several big flaws. But dumb characters are a staple of this series. Where would it be without them? Though this is the only film where they are intended to all live. Can you imagine if Jeff saved the witness, the judge, and the killer in Saw III and all four of them turned up to see Jiggy on his deathbed? It just wouldn't work.Usually when the writers of this series paint themselves into a corner they weasel out of it with flashbacks. Well, more than half of this movie is flashbacks, with the ""present time"" story being entirely disconnected from everything else. The latest victims are only there because it is expected, not because it is vital to the on-going story. But without it the movie would 60 minutes long. Take away the flashbacks and the movie would be nothing more than 10 minutes of FBI agents wandering down corridors with their guns drawn (count how many times this happens, I dare you).By this point,these movies had become a parody of themselves. Everything is all here, the icky atmosphere, the stock cop characters, the dull victims, the elaborate traps, but, curiously, no big twist. The tagline promises that we won't believe how it ends. The shocking ending, lingering on what is probably the worst way to die, is the only thing that saves this film from a 1-star rating.The Blu-ray presents the film in 1.78:1 1080p which highlights the cheap fake-tography's many flaws, and a DTS HD-MA 7.1 sound design.

1213992,AQ01Q3070LT29,B001L9EXU2,James McDonald,"[0, 0]","I will not tell all the surprises in this movie. Just the beginning of the movie.It is very important that you have seen SAW 2, SAW 3 and SAW 4 to fully understand what is going on here. If you missed SAW 4, you might be able to pickup on what is going on in SAW 5, but then again, you don't know about the death of Jigsaw John and how and why the ""games"" and traps continue.Also the SAW movies show brand new footage called ""flashbacks"" that are the missing pieces to a scene and extension in the story in the first SAW (2004), SAW 2, SAW 3 and SAW 4.Returning for another go around is Tobin Bell as ""Jigsaw John"" whom you will see in new ""flashbacks"", Costas Mandylor whom we met in SAW 3 as ""Forensic Hoffman and SAW 4 as ""Detective Hoffman"", Scott Patterson as ""Agent Strahm from SAW 4, Betsy Russell as ""Jill"" from SAW 3 and SAW 4 and Mike Realba as ""Detective Fisk"".Also in the new footage of ""flashbacks"" is Mike Butters of the first SAW (2004), Tim Burd as ""Obi"" and Tony Nappo as ""Gus"" from SAW 2 (2005).Bill Vilbert returns as a cop. Niamh Wilson returns as the little girl, Corbett.In archive footage: Danny Glover, Shawnee Smith, Donnie wahlberg, Lyriq Bent, Angus Macfadyen, Bahar Soumekh, Athena Karkanis and Justin Lovis.When we last left SAW 4 (2007), we discovered that Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) was the new killer taking the place of Jigsaw John and he survived the trap that killed officer Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg).The story continues as we see a man, Seth (Joris Jarsky), strapped to a table with a pendulum swinging back and forth getting closer and closer to his naked, chiseled stomach. He must reach into these hand vises to try and stop the pendulum, but his hands have become cut and crushed. He is running out of time. The pain is too great. He fails the game and the pendulum cuts him deeply to his death. Just before he dies, he sees an eye looking at him from a hole.We will all find out who it is.Now beginning with the same night of SAW 3 and SAW 4, Agent Strahm is on this case and is getting closer to finding out who the killer is, but everyone believes it was Jigsaw John.The movie viewers know Jigsaw John is dead as we saw for ourselves in SAW 3 and SAW 4, we believe Hoffman is the killer.Agent Strahm is investigating the rooms where the murders took place. He winds up back at the Gideon Warehouse in the same room where Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), who is accidentally killed in self-defense, Lynn (Bahar Soumekh), who we found out is Jeff's wife, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) and Jigsaw John have died. To the left, he sees the tiled wall with drawings hung up. He suddenly kicks the wall and a door opens up into a secret passageway.Inside the passageway, he is assaulted by someone dressed in a pig mask. Strahm comes to and finds himself in a trap. A glass case is fixed around his head with lights inside. It fills up with a liquid. Frantic to get loose and to breath, he reaches for his pocket and pulls out a sharp object. He stabs his own throat to continue breathing. He manages to survive the trap and is helped by the back-up unit. Jeff and Lynn's little girl, Corbett, has been saved. Also helped by back-up is Detective Hoffman (but the police department does not know yet, he is the killer).Erickson (Mark Rolston) takes Agent Strahm off the case and is put on medical leave, however, that is not going to stop Strahm from getting more clues. Strahm is still tracking the footsteps of the killer, off-duty, and looks through the department's files. He is hot on the trail, but Erickson catches him in the station and is getting suspicious.Meanwhile, their are 5 people who are in a room (Laura Gordon, Megan Good, Greg Bryk, Julie Benz, Carlo Rota). They are all wearing a neck collar device cabled to the wall behind them in a locker space with very sharp blades that could behead them.  On the other side of the room are the keys in a glass case they need to be set free.  The more that someone pulls on a cable, the others are put back further to the blades.  Their is a jar of explosive nails ready to kill them all, so they must work together and fast. The timer is going.  As in SAW 2, each room has a trap.Also, their is a very nice surprise for all SAW fans.The unrated Director's Cut (Widescreen) runs 95 mins.SAW (2004)Saw [Blu-ray].SAW II (2005)Saw II  unrated-edition and uncut-edition.

Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer) game, MALLICK SCOTT (Greg Bryk), LUBA GIBBS (Meagan Good), and BRIT STEDDISON (Julie Benz) have to prove their will to live, and their ability to COOPERATE.  Meanwhile, DETECTIVE MARK HOFFMAN (Costas Mandylor), FBI AGENT DAN ERICKSON (Mark Rolston), and rugged veteran FBI AGENT PETER STRAHAM (Scott Patterson) are investigating as a team, but PETER STRAHAM may be in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participant learns that EACH may be an accomplice to others' abductions, and their situation provides a choice between SOLVING LETHAL GAMES or guaranteed death.  To help their cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead him (aka a life's perpetrators) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.Several previous murderous contraptions like the RETRACTABLE NECK BLADE TRAP (for an ACCOMPLICE TO MURDER), the BOMB SHELTER ROOM TRAP (for an ACCOMPLICE TO MURDER), and the ELECTRIC BATHTUB (for an ACCOMPLICE TO MURDER) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the PENDULUM BLADE - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S HELP, and on to Saw VI.Jason Elin",3,Saw V - Less Inspired than the rest,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,1994,"['consecutively', 'watching', 'entire', 'Saw', 'series', 'recent', 'weekend', 'LOVING', 'decided', 'single', 'review', 'modified', 'details', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'films', 'Enjoy.A', 'sadistic', 'sociopath', 'similar', 'one', 'Se7en', 'affinity', 'engineering', 'play', 'lethal', 'games', 'forcing', 'victims', 'unappreciative', 'life', 'existential', 'choice', 'million', 'dollars', 'worth', 'engineering', 'machinery.Saw', 'FIVE', 'FIVE', 'people', 'trapped', 'abandoned', 'UNDERGROUND', 'BUILDING', 'Forced', 'play', 'killer', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'John', 'Jigsaw', 'Kramer', 'game', 'MALLICK', 'SCOTT', 'Greg', 'Bryk', 'LUBA', 'GIBBS', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'BRIT', 'STEDDISON', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'have', 'prove', 'will', 'live', 'ability', 'COOPERATE', 'Meanwhile', 'DETECTIVE', 'MARK', 'HOFFMAN', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'FBI', 'AGENT', 'DAN', 'ERICKSON', 'Mark', 'Rolston', 'rugged', 'veteran', 'FBI', 'AGENT', 'PETER', 'STRAHAM', 'Scott', 'Patterson', 'are', 'investigating', 'team', 'PETER', 'STRAHAM', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'deep', 'law', 'increasingly', 'closer', 'ensnaring', 'Jigsaw', 'game', 'participant', 'EACH', 'may', 'be', 'accomplice', 'others', 'abductions', 'situation', 'choice', 'SOLVING', 'LETHAL', 'GAMES', 'guaranteed', 'death', 'help', 'cause', 'cryptic', 'clues', 'left', 'mini', 'cassette', 'tape', 'lead', 'aka', 'life', 'perpetrators', 'towards', 'precipice', 'twisted', 'rehabilitation', 'potential', 'tomb.Several', 'previous', 'murderous', 'contraptions', 'RETRACTABLE', 'NECK', 'BLADE', 'TRAP', 'ACCOMPLICE', 'TO', 'MURDER', 'BOMB', 'SHELTER', 'ROOM', 'TRAP', 'ACCOMPLICE', 'TO', 'MURDER', 'ELECTRIC', 'BATHTUB', 'ACCOMPLICE', 'TO', 'MURDER', 'provide', 'horror', 'fodder', 'form', 'viscera', 'blood', 'spatter', 'other', 'traps', 'PENDULUM', 'BLADE', 'are', 'inserted', 'same', 'reason', 'Spock', 'Kirk', 'always', 'took', 'ensign', 'Jones', 'away', 'parties', 'someone', 'situation', 'die', 'horribly', 'Climax', 'cliffhanger', 'are', 'quick', 'succession', 'flashbacks', 'provide', 'necessary', 'details', 'viewer', 'more', 'JIGSAW', 'HELP', 'Saw', 'VI.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

That is the question the producers faced with ""Saw V"".  At the end of the last movie, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) was left dissected on an operating room table.  End of series, right?  Wrong.  The producers decided to unveil an accomplice of Jigsaw's in this installment.That accomplice turns out to be Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor).  He wastes no time in this movie, as five seemingly unrelated people end up in one of the traps the Saw movies have become famous for.  These people must work their way through a series of rooms, each containing a new trap which must be disabled before they can move on.  At the beginning, these people receive instructions on how they must work together to survive, but will they heed this warning?Meanwhile, it appears that Detective Hoffman is the only survivor from the earlier films.  He is shown at the beginning of part 5 holding a young girl and emerging from the building where Jigsaw was.  But, was he the only survivor?  Despite Hoffman's efforts to stop him, Detective Peter Strahm (Scott Patterson) also survived, and he knows Hoffman's secret.  Now, its up to Strahm to stop Hoffman before its too late.  But, Hoffman is determined to frame Strahm for the murders while keeping his own identity hidden.  Will Strahm succeed at exposing Hoffman, or will Hoffman manage to get rid of Strahm like he did the others?I enjoyed this movie, but I can detect a slip in the overall story.  Tobin Bell's portrayal of Jigsaw is what has made this series so good.  But he is limited to a few flashback sequences in this movie.  I think the producers made a big mistake by killing him off in the previous film.  With the way this movie ends, it appears that there will be yet another movie in the sequence.  Hopefully, the producers will find a way to somehow incorporate Jigsaw back into the series.This movie does contain the effects that made its predecessors famous, including the tricky traps and, of course, blood.  However, I felt that even these items were toned down somewhat from the earlier films.  I hope that this series didn't reach its peak with part 4 and has now begun a downward spiral.",4,"A Dropoff From the Previous ""Saw"" Films",1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,2254,"['How', 'horror', 'movie', 'series', 'continue', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'undeniably', 'killed', 'off', 'previous', 'film', 'question', 'producers', 'faced', 'Saw', 'V', 'end', 'last', 'movie', 'Jigsaw', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'was', 'left', 'dissected', 'operating', 'room', 'table', 'End', 'series', 'right', 'Wrong', 'producers', 'decided', 'unveil', 'accomplice', 'Jigsaw', 'installment.That', 'accomplice', 'out', 'be', 'Detective', 'Mark', 'Hoffman', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'time', 'movie', 'five', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'people', 'end', 'up', 'one', 'traps', 'Saw', 'movies', 'have', 'become', 'famous', 'people', 'must', 'work', 'way', 'series', 'rooms', 'containing', 'new', 'trap', 'must', 'be', 'disabled', 'can', 'move', 'beginning', 'people', 'receive', 'instructions', 'how', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'survive', 'will', 'heed', 'warning', 'Meanwhile', 'Detective', 'Hoffman', 'only', 'survivor', 'earlier', 'films', 'shown', 'beginning', 'part', '5', 'holding', 'young', 'girl', 'emerging', 'building', 'where', 'Jigsaw', 'was', 'was', 'only', 'survivor', 'Hoffman', 'efforts', 'stop', 'Detective', 'Peter', 'Strahm', 'Scott', 'Patterson', 'also', 'survived', 'Hoffman', 'secret', 'Now', 'up', 'Strahm', 'stop', 'Hoffman', 'too', 'late', 'Hoffman', 'determined', 'frame', 'Strahm', 'murders', 'keeping', 'own', 'identity', 'hidden', 'Will', 'Strahm', 'succeed', 'exposing', 'Hoffman', 'will', 'Hoffman', 'manage', 'get', 'rid', 'Strahm', 'did', 'others', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'can', 'detect', 'slip', 'overall', 'story', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'portrayal', 'Jigsaw', 'what', 'made', 'series', 'so', 'good', 'limited', 'few', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'movie', 'think', 'producers', 'made', 'big', 'mistake', 'killing', 'off', 'previous', 'film', 'way', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'yet', 'movie', 'sequence', 'Hopefully', 'producers', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'somehow', 'incorporate', 'Jigsaw', 'back', 'series.This', 'movie', 'contain', 'effects', 'made', 'predecessors', 'famous', 'including', 'tricky', 'traps', 'course', 'blood', 'However', 'felt', 'even', 'items', 'were', 'toned', 'down', 'somewhat', 'earlier', 'films', 'hope', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'peak', 'part', '4', 'now', 'begun', 'downward', 'spiral']",N/A

1214001,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001L9EXU2,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 0]","Well, it is now official the ""Saw"" franchise has without question reached the shameful level that most horror franchises reside upon, meaning every subsequent film will be worse than its predecessor. After viewing ""Saw 4"" I was really gaining the sense that this series was descending into mediocrity, and existed solely for the purpose of providing more blood and gore, with little to no story in the process. With ""Saw 5"" my suspicions have been proven correct, and the series is officially standing still in my opinion; offering no true chills or interesting storytelling, devolving into just another a run-of-the-mill horror franchise at best.""Saw 5"" does what all the previous sequels have done, which is pick up directly where its predecessor left off. Special Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) is investigating the grisly murder scenes left in Jigsaw's bloody wake; and the deeper he digs the darker the revelations become. Attempting to put an end to Agent Strahm's investigation is Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), who just so happens to have been one of Jigsaw's twisted accomplices all along. As these two men close in on each other, a new batch of subjects are fighting for their very lives amidst a series of traps that Jigsaw set into motion prior to his death. Who will make it out alive? Only time will tell... Let the games begin, again.As far as most horror movies go, the story is generally not focused upon all that much past the initial film, as the series generally becomes all about the mayhem and the murder in the sequels. However, when the first film in the ""Saw"" franchise hacked its way into theaters in 2004, boasting a much smarter script than most of its kind; it appeared that perhaps the story was going to have a much more equal share of the screen time as the blood and gore in this series. This stayed true through a majority of the first three films, but by the time ""Saw 4"" was released to theaters in 2007, the story was quickly becoming quite thin and stagnant.With ""Saw 5"" the writing duo of Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, the same writers that penned the previous installment, took the very thin, new layer of story that they had applied in ""Saw 4"" and attempted to build upon it in hopes of stabilizing this weakened series. Instead of moving forward they keep this new story revolving around the very same events that were chronicled in the previous films. Since the groundwork for their new story was laid in ""Saw 4"", this time all they are trying to do is add a new piece into an already far too convoluted and increasingly ridiculous puzzle, by expounding on yet another accomplice to Jigsaw. Along with this new accomplice, who by the way we hadn't seen prior to the fourth film in the series, we are also supposed to believe that Jigsaw had also set into motion another group of people to be tested while he was going to be most likely murdered by one of his test subjects (watch ""Saw 3"" for better understanding on this plot development). Do the writers really expect us to just continue going along believing that this man really planned all of these events into a several day period, while at the same time preparing for the inevitability of his own murder? Apparently so, but the thought process behind this plot isn't working for me anymore.Not to mention, the usage of coincidence as a plot device is being implemented far too liberally in this film. This problem began creeping its way into the series with ""Saw 4"", but by the time we get through ""Saw 5"" it is essentially the main crux of the story, and the only way this storyline is even continuing. I guess it's just further evidence that the writers are just plain lazy and unwilling to actually commit any real thought into creating a truly intriguing story; instead they take the approach of beating an already dead horse until it is virtually unrecognizable.For those that have stuck with the ""Saw"" series from the beginning one staple of the franchise is the usage of very unique and inventive death traps that the victims are required to survive if they hope to regain their life. Over the course of the previous films the traps have consistently remained sick, yet undeniably creative in design. However, in this film the story isn't the only thing that seems haphazardly thrown together, the traps themselves are the most unimaginative in the series. I'm sure to some this may seem like a strange complaint for a movie, but if you have seen any of the previous films in the franchise, then you know where I'm coming from on this. I'm not complaining that the film had less torture than its predecessors, just that the traps are apparently another example of the series' steady decline in creativity and freshness.The cast of ""Saw 5"" continues the tradition that began in ""Saw 2"" which was gather together a bunch of unknown or relatively unknown actors and actresses to play the parts of the would-be victims, while the more recognizable actors that had at least been established in one of the previous films provides the link to past installments. Returning cast members Costas Mandylor and Scott Patterson (""Saw 4"") provide most of the stronger moments within the film, but even that's not saying a whole lot for the movie. Actor Scott Patterson reprises his role as Agent Strahm, and this time he appears to be giving a somewhat stronger performance than his last outing; yet he still appears too wooden in several scenes, so his portrayal looks forced and makes for a difficult time believing him in this type of role. Costas Mandylor seems to be unable to decide if he wants to commit to the role and give us a decent performance (as he does in a few spots) or if he's just going to phone it in (as he appears to do a majority of the time). For the supposed replacement of Jigsaw, Costas' character of Detective Hoffman isn't nearly as interesting as his mentor.Speaking of Hoffman's mentor, the one true highlight of these last couple of sequels is the inclusion of Tobin Bell's character Jigsaw in flashback sequences. Besides his brief voiceovers, that are used in the various tape-recordings delivering the instructions for how to survive the death traps, Bell only appears in the film approximately five to ten minutes tops. Even with his role being relegated to cameo status, Tobin generally does the best he can in the small amount of time he's given, but even his performance isn't above criticism. Unlike his appearances in the previous four movies, Tobin seems to be enjoying his role less and less; perhaps this has something to do with the realization that the only reason he is even in these films any longer is to keep some measure of stability within the dying series. If I were Tobin, I'd consider letting the character's involvement die out soon, especially since the character's actual death occurred two films back.As for those chosen to embody the new crop of victims in Jigsaw's twisted game, at least the casting was a little better than the last couple of films. Most of these people I hadn't seen in any other film and/or television show, except for actress Julie Benz (""Rambo""); but at least they all tried to put a little effort into their roles. Even though Julie is a much more established talent than most of the victims of this film or any of its predecessors (not counting the first film which had a better cast); Julie doesn't really get to do all that much in her role. It seems to me that the victims are now viewed as nothing more than fodder for the traps by the series' writers, unlike in the first film where the victims had a much more developed story arc. In ""Saw"" time was devoted within the script to fleshing out the victimized characters so the audience could be able to invest in them to an extent, but since then less and less time and thought has been put into character development (a major pitfall for almost every single horror franchise).Uninterested in correcting the mistakes of the previous films that have been leading the series into mediocrity, the writers, and their director David Hackl (second unit director on ""Saw 3"" and ""Saw 4""), go to great lengths to stay the course, to the point that the franchise is essentially a pointless mess of unoriginality and laziness. The only other attribute I can apply to this film is that it has taken the title of ""Weakest Film in the Franchise"" from the previous installment, so congratulations on that achievement.""Saw 5"" is

1214003,A18NQ824DQTRK2,B001L9EXU2,kboy2008,"[2, 3]","DON'T READ THIS UNLESS YOU SAW THE MOVIE!I am not normaly a horor fan, most horor movies bore me with lame plots and bad charecters, but the Saw mvoies have made me a horor fan. I have to say thou the last 2 saw movies (4,5) have really let me down. My first and biggist problem I had with this saw movie was in the very end they never said ""game over"" The biggest trade mark of all the movies and for what ever reason was never said, that bothered me. The second thing that really bothered me was I want to know what Hoffman worte in that letter to Amanda, and why did it make her cry. I have some guesses but I really want them to answer that one before they throw out to many other questions.This movie seemed to be a rewrite of Saw II but with different traps and different charecters, with nothing very new or orginal. In Saw II there was a large group of missing people in one house together with traps set all for all of them. If they had all worked together they all would have survived but they truned on eachother and aside from amanda they all died. In this movie there was another large group of people traped in a warehouse with traps in each room, and if they had worked together more than 2 would have lived. Also in Saw II the police were hot on Jigsaw's tail and if it weren't for his ability to decive the cops he would have been arrested. If it weren't for Hoffmans able to pin all the evidence on the other guy in this movie he would have ended up in jail. I really don't think Saw V is anything orginal rather they took the second movie and changed the people and the traps and reasled it.the traps of this movie were totaly lame there was only one that really stuck out at me and that was the fake jigsaw trap. this move also had the stupidist trap of all 5 movies yet. The drowning trap lacked major deatil. First there was no tape at all to explain the rules of the trap or how to win. Jigsaws profile was all about carefuly explaing why they are in the trap, how the trap will kill the person and how to win the trap. This trap had none of theses. Jigsaw was rolling over in his grave over that trap.There has only been two Saw movies where I never saw the ending coming and that was the first and third. The second one I called as soon as I saw Amanda there, and I wasn't sure who the killer was in the 5th movie but I guessed he was involved in the trap somewhere. This movie ending was totaly stupid, and again if you haven't seen the movie I plan to give it away here so stop reading if you haven't seen the movie. In the Saw movies everytime someone gets a tape there put into Jigsaw's game and most of the time there dead at the end of the movie, sometimes not but most of the time yes. As soon as he took the tape and played it in the begining of the movie I knew he'd be dead by the end of the movie. Jigsaw plays off your flaws and his flaw was he never knew when to stop. So having the big twist killing him in a room where the walls closed in around you, was totaly stupid. That trap is one of the oldist in the books.I am going to call how I think Saw VI will go. I think Jigsaw's ex-wife is going to join up with Hoffman and work with him in what ever trap they set for there next set of people, and I think she'll be the twist at the end of the movie. I think this because after she opened the box she seemed to change, she seemed to want to help hoffman. Also it was her that when to the FBI and lied to them about being followed to help put evidence on the other guy. Also in the 4th movie she wasn't too excited about answering questions, she didn't seem to support what Jigsaw was doing but she wasn't to willing to expose him either. The last reason I think she'll join Hoffman is because if she had any plans at exposing Hoffman, Hoffman would have gotten rid of her to insure his identiy as the new jigsaw was kept, he didn't. I wouldn't be suprised if she is in a trap to throw everyone off the track but I really think shes going to join Hoffman.All and all Saw V wasn't too bad, theres nothing here orginal, I think that after Saw 3 it's all been rewrting old scripts and new traps, but I have high hopes for Saw VI for the reason that are new Jigsaw got away and is on hiw own for the first time and they have a really good chance to create some new twist.",3,It could have been better,1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,4306,"['DO', ""N'T"", 'READ', 'THIS', 'UNLESS', 'YOU', 'SAW', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'am', 'not', 'horor', 'fan', 'most', 'horor', 'movies', 'lame', 'plots', 'bad', 'charecters', 'Saw', 'mvoies', 'have', 'made', 'horor', 'fan', 'have', 'say', 'last', '2', 'saw', 'movies', '4,5', 'have', 'really', 'let', 'down', 'first', 'biggist', 'problem', 'had', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'end', 'never', 'said', 'game', 'biggest', 'trade', 'mark', 'movies', 'what', 'ever', 'reason', 'was', 'never', 'said', 'bothered', 'second', 'thing', 'really', 'bothered', 'was', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'Hoffman', 'worte', 'letter', 'Amanda', 'why', 'did', 'make', 'cry', 'have', 'guesses', 'really', 'want', 'answer', 'one', 'throw', 'out', 'many', 'other', 'questions.This', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'rewrite', 'Saw', 'II', 'different', 'traps', 'different', 'charecters', 'nothing', 'very', 'new', 'orginal', 'Saw', 'II', 'was', 'large', 'group', 'missing', 'people', 'one', 'house', 'together', 'traps', 'set', 'had', 'worked', 'together', 'would', 'have', 'survived', 'truned', 'eachother', 'aside', 'amanda', 'died', 'movie', 'was', 'large', 'group', 'people', 'traped', 'warehouse', 'traps', 'room', 'had', 'worked', 'together', 'more', '2', 'would', 'have', 'lived', 'Also', 'Saw', 'II', 'police', 'were', 'hot', 'Jigsaw', 'tail', 'were', ""n't"", 'ability', 'decive', 'cops', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'arrested', 'were', ""n't"", 'Hoffmans', 'able', 'pin', 'evidence', 'other', 'guy', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'jail', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Saw', 'V', 'anything', 'orginal', 'rather', 'took', 'second', 'movie', 'changed', 'people', 'traps', 'reasled', 'it.the', 'traps', 'movie', 'were', 'totaly', 'lame', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'stuck', 'out', 'was', 'fake', 'jigsaw', 'trap', 'move', 'also', 'had', 'stupidist', 'trap', '5', 'movies', 'yet', 'drowning', 'trap', 'lacked', 'major', 'deatil', 'First', 'was', 'tape', 'explain', 'rules', 'trap', 'how', 'win', 'Jigsaws', 'profile', 'was', 'carefuly', 'explaing', 'why', 'are', 'trap', 'how', 'trap', 'will', 'kill', 'person', 'how', 'win', 'trap', 'trap', 'had', 'none', 'theses', 'Jigsaw', 'was', 'rolling', 'over', 'grave', 'trap.There', 'only', 'been', 'two', 'Saw', 'movies', 'where', 'never', 'saw', 'ending', 'coming', 'was', 'first', 'third', 'second', 'one', 'called', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'Amanda', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'who', 'killer', 'was', '5th', 'movie', 'guessed', 'was', 'involved', 'trap', 'somewhere', 'movie', 'ending', 'was', 'totaly', 'stupid', 'again', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'plan', 'give', 'away', 'here', 'so', 'stop', 'reading', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'Saw', 'movies', 'everytime', 'someone', 'tape', 'there', 'put', 'Jigsaw', 'game', 'most', 'time', 'dead', 'end', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'not', 'most', 'time', 'yes', 'As', 'soon', 'took', 'tape', 'played', 'begining', 'movie', 'knew', ""'d"", 'be', 'dead', 'end', 'movie', 'Jigsaw', 'flaws', 'flaw', 'was', 'never', 'knew', 'when', 'stop', 'So', 'having', 'big', 'twist', 'killing', 'room', 'where', 'walls', 'closed', 'was', 'totaly', 'stupid', 'trap', 'one', 'oldist', 'books.I', 'am', 'going', 'call', 'how', 'think', 'Saw', 'VI', 'will', 'go', 'think', 'Jigsaw', 'ex-wife', 'going', 'join', 'up', 'Hoffman', 'work', 'what', 'ever', 'set', 'next', 'set', 'people', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'twist', 'end', 'movie', 'think', 'opened', 'box', 'seemed', 'change', 'seemed', 'want', 'help', 'hoffman', 'Also', 'was', 'when', 'FBI', 'lied', 'being', 'followed', 'help', 'put', 'evidence', 'other', 'guy', 'Also', '4th', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'excited', 'answering', 'questions', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'support', 'what', 'Jigsaw', 'was', 'doing', 'was', ""n't"", 'willing', 'expose', 'either', 'last', 'reason', 'think', ""'ll"", 'join', 'Hoffman', 'had', 'plans', 'exposing', 'Hoffman', 'Hoffman', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'rid', 'insure', 'identiy', 'new', 'jigsaw', 'was', 'kept', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'suprised', 'trap', 'throw', 'everyone', 'track', 'really', 'think', 'shes', 'going', 'join', 'Hoffman.All', 'Saw', 'V', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'nothing', 'here', 'orginal', 'think', 'Saw', '3', 'been', 'rewrting', 'old', 'scripts', 'new', 'traps', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'Saw', 'VI', 'reason', 'are', 'new', 'Jigsaw', 'got', 'away', 'hiw', 'own', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'really', 'good', 'chance', 'create', 'new', 'twist']",N/A

Huston,"[0, 0]","Ok I love all of the Saw movies, however I was very disappointed that we did not get to find out what was in the letter that made Amanda cry.  Why else would we learn in Saw IV that Hoffman placed the letter?  I thought for sure it was a perfect set up for an answer in Saw V. (maybe Saw VI?) Am I the only one who feels this way?  Also I find it very puzzling that we still hear Jigsaw's voice on the majority of the tapes in Saw V, though we do see Jigsaw on his death bed in a flashback scene handing Hoffman a file with information on the five new people whom will play a game, so I guess he could have.  This brings about another point: SPOILER ALERT.  If Hoffman had set up Seth Baxter's death to look like a Jigsaw game, then why do we hear Jigsaw's voice on the tape?  We know Seth was killed before Paul from the original Saw and before Hoffman had met John, so this does not make sense to me.

If you're new to this movie, forget it, unless you're willing to sit through all the others first in order to put this one into context.  It makes no sense otherwise.  This production is excellent.  Top notch. The sets are well layed out and detailed and function in a believable manner. That's important since much of this movie is about people escaping from the deadly traps that ""Jigsaw"" sets for his victims. The other thing going on is an attempt to put the final nail into the ""jigsaw"" murders. The acting is passable, though not very believable except for Greg Byrk who plays a hapless dope addict ( Mallick ) and is scared witless during most of the events. Of the victims he's the only one who draws you in with any real sympathy. The series should end, now. It's gone on long enough, and it lacks the punch of the original anymore.  The series tries to present the torments of the vicitims as ethical revenge for crimes they commited against society, but that theme doesn't play very well. Tobin Bell gave a chilling performance in the early movies of this series as a man with a mission, to force conscience onto and into people who exhibit none.  Every killer thinks he has a justified reason for killing. Putting it terms of social justice doesn't make it any more acceptable. But to the credit of the writers, Jigsaw's victims are given a chance to survive. The traps are deadly but not necessarily fatal, if the method of surviving them can be figured out. Of course, there's a time factor invovled, so if you don't think well under pressure... you're dead. If you're up to speed on the SAW movie series, then I highly recommend this one.

1214018,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B001L9EXU2,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 3]","Back in 2004 when the original Saw was released, it was a refreshing change of pace for the horror genre.  At the time, there seemed to be a new PG-13 rated remake of a Japanese horror film released every other month, and the inventive violence of Saw was a worthwhile change of pace.  Fast forward four years and four sequels later, and it appears that the Saw series has finally run its course.  Inventive kills are pretty much replaced by sheer boredom and the traps just seem more tired and contrived than ever.  David Hackl, who served as the production designer on Saw II, III, and IV, gets the director duties after Darren Lynn Bousman had enough of the series, and the film is all the worse for it.  Picking up where Saw IV left off, we see just how forensics man Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) became Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell, who appears all too briefly) disciple, and we learn the fate of Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson).  In the meantime, another group of people (including Dexter's Julie Benz in a horrible wig) get caught in another trap, and it all amounts to being a boring and predictable trip that hardly answers any of the questions that have been raised since the first film onward.  While there's no doubt another Saw on the way, Saw V should be the writing on the wall that the series has managed to overstay its welcome.",1,Are we done yet?,1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,1333,"['Back', '2004', 'when', 'original', 'Saw', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'horror', 'genre', 'time', 'seemed', 'be', 'new', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'remake', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film', 'released', 'other', 'month', 'inventive', 'violence', 'Saw', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'change', 'pace', 'Fast', 'forward', 'four', 'years', 'four', 'sequels', 'later', 'Saw', 'series', 'finally', 'run', 'course', 'Inventive', 'kills', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'replaced', 'sheer', 'boredom', 'traps', 'just', 'seem', 'more', 'tired', 'contrived', 'ever', 'David', 'Hackl', 'who', 'served', 'production', 'designer', 'Saw', 'II', 'III', 'IV', 'director', 'duties', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'had', 'enough', 'series', 'film', 'worse', 'Picking', 'up', 'where', 'Saw', 'IV', 'left', 'off', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'forensics', 'man', 'Hoffman', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'became', 'Jigsaw', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'who', 'too', 'briefly', 'disciple', 'learn', 'fate', 'Agent', 'Strahm', 'Scott', 'Patterson', 'meantime', 'group', 'people', 'including', 'Dexter', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'horrible', 'wig', 'get', 'caught', 'trap', 'amounts', 'being', 'boring', 'predictable', 'trip', 'hardly', 'questions', 'have', 'been', 'raised', 'first', 'film', 'onward', 'doubt', 'Saw', 'way', 'Saw', 'V', 'should', 'be', 'writing', 'wall', 'series', 'managed', 'overstay', 'welcome']",N/A

The next day, the police hold a memorial service for all the cops who died while trying to capture Jigsaw. Hoffman receives a letter that says ""I know who you are."" So, he tries to frame Strahm to look like Jigsaw's apprentice. Meanwhile, five people have to play a game and work together in order to survive. Some of the traps were pretty cool. Strahm revisits some of the old Jigsaw traps, like Paul's razor wire trap from the original Saw.

1214024,A39W3263A9HCMN,B001L9EXU2,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[5, 10]","Well another year and you had to expect it: Another Saw movie. To say you didn't see it coming, you'd have to be living under a rock or something like that. MTV kids, preppy teenage girls who like to get scared and grossed out, and hardcore gore fans will inevitably flock to the theaters and pay their hard-earned cash just to see a movie with the ""Saw"" prefix in the title. And ever since Saw II it's been happening like that (Not to say I didn't like that movie, just an expression), and forever will until Saw 56 gets released in the distant future.Now let's go back and look at the previous Saw movies:SAW: It was a very different movie for me, yet in a good way. It had a very good story, some great acting and a twist that you couldn't see coming. Plus the villain was just pure evil, I loved it.SAW II: I loved this one just as much as the first. It had more blood but was still pretty tame, and yet it worked as a really good thriller. You can't deny the best scenes were Jigsaw's and Eric Matthews' conversations- the way they were played out and acted was really brilliant and I LOVED the chemistry between the two characters. It was like they admired each other but hated each other at the same time. And yet the traps were clever and brilliantly played out- it added to the suspense-thriller feel.SAW III: The goriest one, but my favorite. It was really fast paced and had some of the best acting in a horror movie. And 3 great twists at the end!SAW IV Very unnecessary, but OK nonetheless. Yes it was a tad lame, but it had its moments.And now we're at Saw V, scraping the bottom of the barrel and digging a hole in the ground. After my dad and I saw Saw III in the theater, I never thought the Saw movies would become another Freddy Vs. Jason thing, but it did now. Like I mentioned before, Saw IV had its moments, but this one stinks so much it makes Saw IV look Oscar-worthy. It literally took me an hour to think up a single word of how awful this was since it was so bad. At the screening I was at, people were looking around at each other with ""What the hell was that?"" facial expressions. Some were even calling their friends up to tell them how bad it was. You really can't blame them, though. If I had my cell phone on me at the screening, I would have been doing the same thing in the walk to the car.WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!!So it begins with some useless sap we can't feel any sympathy for chained to a table. After the Jiggy video, a swinging pendulum drops low enough just to touch his body, and he must crush his hands in order to get out. And he gets sliced in half by the swinging pendulum of doom. Then we go to Strahm, who's been trapped in the sick room. He finds all sorts of crazy stuff and then gets put in a trap, involving his head in a glass box of water by Hoffman. He stabs a pen into his neck to breathe, causing him to sound like Jimbo from South Park throughout the rest of the movie. Then we go to some group of 5 people trapped in a house, where they think they have to kill each other to get out. One gets decapitated by the necktie trap. Some traps include the ""Exploding room trap"" where they have to smash glass jars to get the keys, the bathtub trap where one has to be electrocuted, etc. Then we suffer through a never-ending stream of flashbacks, because the entire ending is one. To what we already saw. About an hour and a half ago. But, like Saw I-IV, with a twist! A stupid one, this time.That's pretty much all you needed to know. The tagline is ""You won't believe how it ends"", but what I can't believe is that the series has NO end. Really, the series should have ended at III. Now they're really trying to strike the iron while it's still hot. I'm sure the ultra super Director's Cut with the holographic cover and a ticket to Saw VI will no doubt showcase all of the movie's alternate endings, but at this point, I'm not sure if I care. And to the guy who started it: STOP THIS MADNESS NOW!!!!!! You started the series, you can properly end it. Or better yet- should have properly ended it after 3. But really, will it stop if we say we learned our lesson already?So overall, this is a waste of time and money. Really, I guess the tagline should be ""You won't believe you just wasted your money"", because I sure couldn't.

Once you get to a certain point, however, you have to wonder why people continue to make these movies profitable. The Saw series has been nothing more than an excuse for the screenwriters to come up with more inventive ways to kill people since the second flick. This one continues on in the same tradition: do some basic exploration of the killer's back story while coming up with a fresh new crop of victims stuck in inventive traps.This time we get parallel stories: that of how Agent Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), Jigsaw's other apprentice, became a part of the family, and Strahm (Scott Patterson) racing to save a group of six victims stuck in Jigsaw's most recent devious scheme, a series of traps they have to get through while figuring out what it is they all have in common.When it comes right down to it, like the rest of the recent movies in the series, Saw V is watchable, but not much else. If you're looking for originality, scripting, above-average directorial work, great acting, or anything else, this is probably one to avoid.

It quickly changes to John's wife receiving a video tape he made for her before his death, and a box whose contents John mentions are of the utmost importance.  Unfortunately, we don't get to peek in the box.Agent Strahm of the FBI finds the remains left behind from SAW III, the scene of John's death.  But someone jumps him and he finds himself in a serious water trap.  You'll love his escape method.  But Detective Hoffman was to be the only survivor of the scene, and with Strahm wounded Hoffman is promoted to Lieutenant.  Strahm knows there's something fishy about the case, and suspects an accomplice to John other than Amanda.  In his own trap, Hoffman's straps broke, and John just doesn't make mistakes like that.Once removed from the case, Strahm discovers his suspicions are correct.  Detective Hoffman is playing John's games for him.  We find out just how deep the rabbit hole goes between John and Hoffman, going back to Hoffman killing his sister's murderer with the pendulum trap from the beginning.  What was wrong with it?  ""I've never killed anyone"", John says.  John tells Hoffman what he did was ""distasteful, inferior work, and that everyone deserves a chance at rehabilitation.""Their bond is explored through flashbacks, the transition sometimes unclear.  Hoffman reminisces while Strahm follows the trails of the old crimes.  During which, the lives of five people are at risk, going through a new and unique trap composed of several rooms they must pass through.  There's some great traps here, and a big surprise at the ending.This is the old John I missed from SAW IV.  He's back, though in flashbacks, and better than ever.  His self-composed attitude and nonchalant ""rehabilitation"" treatments are definitely up to par.  There's clearly an opening for a SAW VI in the future.  While SAW I remains my favorite, and I saw the series going downhill after SAW IV, SAW V has redeemed the series and I can't wait for the next installment.

Good old fashion throat slashing. Sound like fun? Then...it's your future...I see Saw V in your Amazon cart!By now the Saw story--whether it's the original or one of the many sequels--should be familiar enough: Jigsaw wants you to appreciate life more. So to get you to do so, he tests you. He wants to play a game....Get through the booby trap infested film and live. Fail, then die. Make your choice. But wait...isn't Jigsaw dead? Oh that's right...he had a bunch of disciples in training to take over his murderous reins, right? I don't really remember. And that's the problem. While the original Saw was a classic in the genre, Saw 2 through 4 were just tortuously entertaining, but also redundantly forgettable.So after catching Saw V on cable this month I often found myself completely lost when the film attempted to make connections to the previous Saw films. And Saw V had me drowning in so many twists of its own, in addition to the tie-ins that I was supposed to be remembering from its predecessors, that I needed to tracheotomize myself with a pen to help me get my breath.The diabolical and deadly traps that are set throughout the film make it fun to watch...in a demented kind of way. But trying to keep up with the story for me is over and there will be no Saw VI in my future. So as I said earlier...do you wanna see some crazy faces of death? Then great, Saw V will provide. But if you want to follow the story you'd best be very familiar with the previous movies and pay attention as you're watching Saw V, otherwise the credits will be rolling and you'll look as confused as I did.",2,The Torture Never Stops,1269907200,"03 30, 2010",2010,1737,"['Smashing', 'extremities', 'Compound', 'bone', 'fractures', 'Decapitation', 'Bodies', 'completely', 'ripped', 'apart', 'Self', 'mutilation', 'sake', 'survival', 'Good', 'old', 'fashion', 'throat', 'slashing', 'Sound', 'fun', 'Then', 'future', 'see', 'Saw', 'V', 'Amazon', 'cart', 'now', 'Saw', 'story', 'original', 'one', 'many', 'sequels', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'enough', 'Jigsaw', 'appreciate', 'life', 'more', 'So', 'get', 'do', 'so', 'play', 'game', 'booby', 'trap', 'infested', 'film', 'live', 'Fail', 'then', 'die', 'Make', 'choice', 'wait', ""n't"", 'Jigsaw', 'dead', 'Oh', 'right', 'had', 'bunch', 'disciples', 'training', 'take', 'over', 'murderous', 'reins', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'problem', 'original', 'Saw', 'was', 'classic', 'genre', 'Saw', '2', '4', 'were', 'just', 'tortuously', 'entertaining', 'also', 'redundantly', 'forgettable.So', 'catching', 'Saw', 'V', 'cable', 'month', 'often', 'found', 'completely', 'lost', 'when', 'film', 'attempted', 'make', 'connections', 'previous', 'Saw', 'films', 'Saw', 'V', 'had', 'drowning', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'own', 'addition', 'tie-ins', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'remembering', 'predecessors', 'needed', 'tracheotomize', 'pen', 'help', 'get', 'breath.The', 'diabolical', 'deadly', 'traps', 'are', 'set', 'film', 'make', 'watch', 'demented', 'kind', 'way', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'Saw', 'VI', 'future', 'said', 'earlier', 'do', 'wan', 'see', 'crazy', 'death', 'Then', 'great', 'Saw', 'V', 'will', 'provide', 'want', 'follow', 'story', ""'d"", 'best', 'be', 'very', 'familiar', 'previous', 'movies', 'pay', 'attention', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Saw', 'V', 'otherwise', 'credits', 'will', 'be', 'rolling', ""'ll"", 'look', 'as', 'confused', 'did']",N/A
1214031,A35FMDBNQ2SI52,B001L9EXU2,"Squash 'N' Squeak ""The Silencing Machine""","[0, 0]","I don't really write reviews anymore, since I have neither as much time nor interest as I once had. But I felt compelled to write a review for this movie, since I love this series so much.The Saw series will never be recognized for what it is. The critics will always slam it for having gore, torture, scenes, consisting of 5 movies, and being a world-wide sensation. It isn't foreign, it isn't avant-garde, and it's extremely mainstream. How could any movie snob possibly see anything in this series?You know what? I've never cared about the critic's opinions. I've stuck by this series for so long, because the screenplays have been very intelligent, and continuity has always been respected in the series. But here, everything that was established in the previous movies has been left meaningless.Saw 5 picks up where Saw 4 left off, with Agent Strahm stuck inside the sick room. After surviving the first trap, he begins to suspect that Detective Hoffman is the new mastermind behind the Jigsaw murders. As he goes on the hunt to find evidence to support his theory, many old scenes are revisited.This sounds like a cool idea on paper, and it would have been really neat to see. Unfortunately... this movie takes a big dump over the story points established in the previous films. This never would have happened if Leigh and James wrote this movie. Hoffman is inserted extremely far back into the timeline, before the events of the first film even took place. The entire past was re-written to include a detective that was an afterthought in the last few minutes of finishing Saw 3. Oh but it doesn't stop there... this movie creates plot holes of epic proportions. In the original trilogy, it was established that John Kramer wasn't known as the Jigsaw Killer until Paul's trap was discovered. This movie makes him infamous before Paul's trap was even made! And somehow, Detective Hoffman used Billy (the puppet) in Seth's trap before it was even built - A flashback in Saw 3 carefully established when and where Billy was made - right before Amanda's trap. And how exactly did Hoffman get John's voice on the tape. *Sigh* I actually thought the idea of Hoffman being a copy-cat Jigsaw to avenge his sister's death was a really cool concept, but it could have been handled, much, much, MUCH better.Oh Jigsaw, where art though. While once a calm, collected, and intelligent man, he is portrayed as a psychotic cookie-cutter lunatic like in every other run-of-the-mill slasher movie out there. Now, I understand John is a psycho - it's obvious that he is - but at least he was an intelligent psycho. Not anymore. This movie also has the worst line in the history of Saw. It's during the flashback of Hoffman's test: ""KILLING IS DISTASTEFUL!!!!!!111 ...to me."" Ok, John. First, murder is unacceptable to you, and you despise murderers. Now it's ""distasteful""? Taking out the trash is distasteful. Doing tedious grunt work in a convenient store is distasteful. Sitting around and doing nothing all day is distasteful. And now, murder is distasteful. Oy.Now, of course, there's the main game in the movie. In the previous films, the main game has tied in extremely well with the rest of the story line. The victims have had some sort of interconnection, and it all leads up to some sort of connection with John. That's what was so great about the others. Well guess what? The main game in Saw 5 has nothing - NOTHING - to do with anything in the series or even the movie. It's as if the writers said to each other ""Uh... what movie are we writing again? Oh yeah, Saw! We're forgetting the traps! Oh we better just stick them in here really fast."" hours before it was all complete. These victims are connected, but it doesn't make them relevant, in any way, to everything else. It's pathetic.Amanda... my poor poor Amanda. While once such a crucial element in the first 3 films has been all but forgotten, and succumbed to archive footage. She's my favorite character of the series right after John. In this movie, her relationship with John has been destroyed and left meaningless. Saw 3, in all of its emotional baggage and glory, established how close she was with John. Saw 5 takes it, spits on it, and throws it out the window. Get this - Amanda was completely unaware of Hoffman's involvement. If that doesn't scream out that Amanda was nothing more than a pawn, then I don't know what does. It saddened me to see how easily Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan dismissed her.Agent Strahm... what happened? In Saw 4 he was such a cool character who was super-cop. I'm ok with the fact that he died, but his character was dumbed down severely in this movie. I was laughing at the screen while he talked to himself while sorting out everything in his head. Between his head being stuck in the water box trap, and being taken off the Jigsaw case, he must have either developed schizophrenia, or became very lonely with the news of Agent Perez's death.It isn't all bad, though. The traps in this movie are pretty amazing, actually - much better than the mediocre traps of Saw 4. The first 2 and the last 2 traps are probably my favorite. Director David Hackl, the trap designer of the previous movies, said that he saved the best traps for this movie, and it shows. Speaking of Hackl, he's a fantastic director. Darren Lynn Bousman, director of 2, 3, and 4, has a good style, but those quick cuts and flashes of light became an eye-sore in Saw 4. His style is more like James Wan's, but it's actually his own unique style, and a lot easier on the eyes. I'm sad that he won't be back to direct Saw 6.This new trilogy has a conclusion with Saw 6, supposedly; just like how Saw 3 was supposed to be the conclusion. I was happy to know this, as I certainly wouldn't want the series to turn into a joke, but unfortunately, it seems like that's going to happen. Tobin Bell's contract has been renewed for an additional 3 movies after saw 6, which is too bad. There are only so many flashbacks you can add before the timeline gets over-complicated and turns into a mess, which is funny, considering that's already happened. All in all, not a bad movie, but definitely the weakest of the series to date. My expectations for Saw 6 will be considerably lower.P.S. They made a big mistake with the tag line - You Won't Believe How It Ends. The Saw films are popular for their twist ending - not this time. I knew Strahm was going to die the second I heard that tape. It doesn't bother me that I predicted the ending beforehand, but it certainly made a LOT of fans mad.",3,A let down. *spoilers*,1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,6555,"['do', ""n't"", 'really', 'write',

1214034,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B001L9EXU2,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[0, 0]","Saw V is by no means a Bad movie, but it's a big step down from the previous chapter, which itself was a little ways down from the excellent first three installments.  I'm not going to give away any surprises on this chapter, but it's kind of impossible to do a write-up without giving away the twists for the earlier movies, so if you haven't seen all four previous Saws you might want to skip this review.**WARNING - SPOILERS FOR THE PREVIOUS SERIES ENTRIES AHEAD****With the main body (i.e. flashbacks not included) of Saw IV  having  turned out to have been taking place simultaneously with Saw III, not after it, Saw V opens with the same challenges and the same potential that Saw IV was seemingly going to have: Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and Amanda (Shawnee Smith) are dead (although still available for flashbacks) but Jigsaw's final game is all set to go into motion: the child of one of the survivors of Jigsaw's games in Saw III is missing, and the 'game' for their recovery is all pre-set.  As I mentioned in previous Saw reviews, Saw III was the first one where it really started to feel that Jigsaw's whole idea of 'life lessons' and his whole twisted brand of morality is real, at least in his own mind, and that he's not just using it as an excuse for a bloody reign of terror.  It made the whole series stronger, and how this was going to fit into the kidnapped child plot was a big question.  For the first time, Jigsaw has taken someone who, even in his own warped mind, is completely innocent.  Is he really going to have set up the whole game so that innocent may actually die?  The chance to go deep into the psychology of not just Jigsaw but the players who are poised to navigate this final game, had tons of potential.  At the end of Saw III, Jigsaw said to the survivor who had a gun on him, that he'd give him everything he'd wanted if he would forgive him (Jigsaw) but that he'd lose everything if he couldn't bring himself to do so.  Everybody who's seen the previous movies already knows that he kills Jigsaw, Before he hears the final recording revealing that his child has been taken.  I really wanted to see this played up on.  What was going on with Jigsaw's seeking of forgiveness; was it just a ploy in one of his tests, or was part of him starting to doubt the 'mission' he'd dedicated himself to?Unfortunately, virtually none of this gets followed up on.  The plot lines left open at the end of Part III are resolved quickly and with no detail, almost as if they're just trying to get them out of the way to move on to Part V's major focus: that of Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor)'s role as the new sole villain.  That Hoffman was in on the whole scenario for a while was revealed in Saw IV, and the ending for that movie seemed to indicate that Jigsaw had another back-up game in the works, that he had judged Hoffman unworthy and was going to test or punish him through some set-up he orchestrated before his demise.  Hoffman, Jigsaw has decided, is in it for the violence and the sense of power, without any commitment to what Jigsaw sees as a higher purpose, and he's very disappointed in his protege.  Incredibly though, after failing to follow up Part III's open end, Saw V also opts out of following up on Part IV's end twist.  And as for the end twist this time around, while I'm not going to reveal it, when a movie has the tagline ""You Won't Believe How It Ends"" and then the final scene hits and goes to the end credits and you're left thinking, What?  That's IT?, you know something has gone wrong somewhere.Saw V focuses on Hoffman carrying on the Jigsaw killings while trying to remain undetected by his fellow police officers, one of whom is getting suspicious.  This 'double life' idea had potential, but it didn't quite click together.  Hoffman in the lead role made a fairly weak substitute for Jigsaw and Amanda, and that wasn't the actor's fault: he worked with what he had.  The movie's continuing flashbacks detail how Hoffman originally became part of Jigsaw's inner circle, but while previous entries's flashbacks - including those that tell of the tragedies that started twisting Jigsaw's psyche long before he knew he was dying - worked, we're now getting to the point where it feels like we're just adding on layer after layer of backstory and starting to dilute the original ideas.  I kept waiting for some major shock or revelation at the end to power the movie up, but it didn't materialize (at least, it didn't work for me; others may find the ending more effective). After having pointed out so many of the shortcomings, I want to stress that Saw V does have it's good points, enough to get a three-star rating.  Strong acting all around, a continued (if slightly weakened) overall effectiveness and inventiveness to the death traps that are part of the 'games', a really strong opening ten minutes, and, as usual, a good musical score.Now it might be that some of the ideas left unexplored will get picked up in Part VI; it might even be that Part VI winds up tying everything together brilliantly and makes the way Part V unfolded look necessary, in the same way that aspects of Part I and Part II got even stronger after Part III successfully built up on certain aspects of the series.  I'm left thinking that they made all the wrong choices in which way to go with Part V, but it could be that they have a larger plan for patching it all together, and I'll be proved wrong: I hope that happens.  But as it stands now, Part V was a big drop down.  If the plan is to pace out the different ideas and concepts so they can be spread out to increase the number of sequels, I think the time for that strategy has passed, and they have to put every good idea, every new twist, every way of pulling the series back into top shape, directly into Part VI and not worry about saving something out for further down the line.  If they can get more good chapters later, great, but first the downward slide of the series has to be stopped.In its defense, it did have some high bars to live up to, and the filmmakers had their work cut out for them trying to make a Saw movie work with its leads dead. Even though it's not on par with the rest of the series, still worth seeing for the Saw fan.",3,"Still Pretty Good, But Definately The Least Of The Series",1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,6250,"['Saw',

But the ending was SO INCREDIBLY AWESOME I became hooked and have seen the rest of the SAW movies all on their opening weekends. I thought each one got a little better. SAW V is so far from the originals it's not even funny. If you asked how much more story could be told by flashbacks the answer should be NONE. But nope. I swear half the movie was flashbacks, and WAY more distracting and pointless than those in SAW 3. Although the flashbacks in SAW 3 were annoying at times, the rest of the movie made up for it.So back to SAW 5. Boring, pointless. The people in the big trap lair here are so meaningless to the story if you blink you'll forget they're even in it. More questions are asked than answered in this one, and the ones that are answered you could have guessed after watching SAW IV. I can't say too much more about how obvious and forgettable most of this movie was without giving away some of the horrible plot. I will say this: SAW 1 had possibly THE BEST ""of my god you never could have seen this ending coming"" endings of all time. (M knight shamalamadingdong WISHES he could come up with such a twist) I think that SAW 2 also had not just a twist at the ending, but a couple of twists. SAW 3, not as good but still a twist. SAW 4 just hit you with a whole bunch of twists at the end. POW POW POW!That is what I enjoyed about those movies. I also enjoyed watching and realizing that what you're seeing is not necessarily in order and how this ""time-shifting"" contributed to the great twists at the end. I remember talking with my Wife all the way home from the theater after watching SAW IV trying to figure out what happened. The movie SHOULD make you have to think about it, to still be attempting to put all the pieces together and see if you missed anything.The ending of SAW V will leave you saying, ""huh...that's it?

I've always liked horror movies and this is one of the only horror franchises that I've made the effort to see in the theater on opening night.The theater was packed with people, even though it was a midnight showing.As I watched the events of Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) and Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and the ruthless Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) unfolding in front of me, I realized that the Saw franchise had turned a corner, and not in a positive direction.This movie wasn't great, and it wasn't terrible, but just about every plot device was already used in Saw II. The quick MTV-style scene cuts are here, the gory and marvelously inventive traps are here, and if that's what you want to see, you won't be disappointed.The ""Twist"" ending, however, is fairly predictable, especially to anyone who has already seen the previous Saw movies.As the theater patrons left, everyone was saying pretty much the same thing - discussing traps, the amount of blood & gore, etc. However, one person said ""It didn't feel new.""This movie reminded me of my 16 year old dog - he had vision problems, his hind legs didn't work well, and even though all the signs of old age were there, I still loved him, right up to the end.If you're a die-hard Saw fan, you'll probably see it in the theater like I did...but you might find yourself wondering how much life the franchise has left in it.",3,No new ground for this Saw to cut through.,1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,1459,"['become', 'tradition', 'see', 'Saw', 'movie', 'theater', '2004', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'horror', 'movies', 'one', 'only', 'horror', ""'ve"", 'made', 'effort', 'see', 'theater', 'opening', 'night.The', 'theater', 'was', 'packed', 'people', 'even', 'was', 'midnight', 'showing.As', 'watched', 'events', 'Agent', 'Strahm', 'Scott', 'Patterson', 'Detective', 'Hoffman', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'ruthless', 'Jigsaw', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'unfolding', 'front', 'realized', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'had', 'turned', 'corner', 'not', 'positive', 'direction.This', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'just', 'plot', 'device', 'was', 'already', 'used', 'Saw', 'II', 'quick', 'MTV-style', 'scene', 'cuts', 'are', 'here', 'gory', 'marvelously', 'inventive', 'traps', 'are', 'here', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'Twist', 'ending', 'however', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'especially', 'anyone', 'who', 'already', 'seen', 'previous', 'Saw', 'movies.As', 'theater', 'patrons', 'left', 'everyone', 'was', 'saying', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'discussing', 'traps', 'amount', 'blood', 'gore', 'etc', 'However', 'one', 'person', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'new', 'movie', 'reminded', '16', 'year', 'old', 'dog', 'had', 'vision', 'problems', 'hind', 'legs', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'even', 'signs', 'old', 'age', 'were', 'there', 'still', 'loved', 'right', 'up', 'end.If', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'Saw', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'see', 'theater', 'did', 'might', 'find', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'life', 'franchise', 'left']",N/A

But with Jigsaw dead, how does the Saw series keep the game from becoming overtly predictable? The answer is not revealed in ""Saw V,"" which shows the series becoming an utterly predictable Halloween event.Jigsaw (Tobin Bell, weirdly malevolent as ever) is still dead. That minor fact, however, does not negate his being in ""Saw V"" in various states of criminal commission, with or without Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) as his accomplice. Still hot on the case FBI Agent Pete Strahm (Scott Patterson) is on Hoffman's trail, and there are five hapless but interconnected folks now secured in one of Jigsaw's traps.The traps are, as usual, freaky. The FBI cops are trying to figure out who dunnit. Mrs. Jigsaw discovers she has inherited a mysterious box from her dearly departed, but we aren't allowed to see the contents after she peeks in (hmmm, preview of the plot for ""Saw VI""?). What is missing is any sense of newness to the film, or a real hard twist at the end. For a film with a tagline of ""You won't believe how it ends,"" that's only partway true. I was really expecting more.While I still thinkSaw IIis the best of the series, ""Saw V"" comes off as little else than a cop caper with some of that old time gore tossed in for squeamish factor.Saw IVwas definitely more squirm inducing, which makes you wonder why they didn't spend a little more time trimming the fat and adding a bit more slashing.

At the conclusion of Saw IV we now understand who is continuing Jigsaw's legacy as Lieutenant Mark Hoffman says the words ""game over"". This time around agent Peter Strahm is on the path to discover who is continuing the Jigsaw legacy after John Kramer and Amanda Young's deaths. This Saw really focuses on Hoffman as we get to know who he is, his past (explained trough flashbacks) and how he came to work with Jigsaw. Jill Tuck, Jigsaw's ex-wife receives a box and we are left wondering what's in it and what kind of importance it has to the Saw movies.

I thought this fourth sequel was very clever and it's certainly an important one to the series as it plants the seed for what's next to come (watch Saw VI and you'll why it was so important) and we get to really know Hoffman, an important character.

However the subjects don't listen to the rules closely enough, and you know what happens when you ignore the rules!The ending didn't have much of a twist, but the last trap was pretty gruesome and of course clever.Why do I say that this is still a good sequel along with the rest? Well, ""the answer is simple"" This series has a morality tale and good charecter development storyline almost every time, it's neat to have a killer that has some sense of morality, despite his dementia, how's that for an answer?",4,Although David Hackl is not as good as director....,1265155200,"02 3, 2010",2010,924,"['David', 'Hackl', 'over', 'director', 'not', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousmann', 'James', 'Wan', 'However', 'film', 'still', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'rest', 'series.Amanda', 'Jigsaw', 'are', 'dead', 'new', 'protege', 'film', 'primarily', 'how', 'met', 'Jsaw.The', 'newest', 'game', 'five', 'test', 'subjects', 'trapped', 'factory', 'finish', 'game', 'must', 'perform', 'acts', 'sacrifice', 'order', 'escape', 'However', 'subjects', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'rules', 'closely', 'enough', 'know', 'what', 'when', 'ignore', 'rules', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'twist', 'last', 'trap', 'was', 'pretty', 'gruesome', 'course', 'clever.Why', 'do', 'say', 'still', 'good', 'sequel', 'rest', 'Well', 'answer', 'simple', 'series', 'morality', 'tale', 'good', 'charecter', 'development', 'storyline', 'almost', 'time', 'neat', 'have', 'killer', 'sense', 'morality', 'dementia', 'how', 'answer']",N/A
1214041,A96JD9312DHWC,B001L9EXU2,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[0, 0]","The games have just begun - that was the credo that empowered the Jigsaw killer and it is also the truth that keeps onkeeping on. Even after what happened to Jigsaw during the last test he gave to a former employee (or partner, or whatever you want to call her), Jigsaw still has a voice and hands to do his dirty deeds. He also has a thing about police officers that has been explained to us in vivid detail, and we find out why this is - if we haven't already pieced that together. There is another game being played as well, one that talks about working together and one that the team of people placed inside this horror don't seem to get, and that is the lovely part about so many of these things. People are such bad listeners - just play the tape and take the game seriously, because this is their lives. The traps here are nasty little things, too, and they are loveingly deceptive because they al;low people to see what they should do but give them the freedom to choose. It is perhaps there, in that freedom of choice, that people mmake their worse mistakes.As Jigsaw would say, let the games begin.I've taken to the movies well because I thought they were all done really well, overcoming things like budgetary confines by utilizing Tobin Bell and the saw puppet as things that make the flesh quiver. They also have traps that have duality stamped into their very being, and this duality allows the games to become things that seem to be one thing when they are, in fact, tests that measure other items. I always liked that, enjoying the fact that people are challenged to see the world in different ways, and that some people really do have the means to their liberation. And the ones that do not seem fair, almost unfairly doing things to people with no way out, we see exactly how that happens. And the answers to that are brutal, and unfair on so many levels. Combine with that the acting prowess of some of the individuals involved (I think it takes a lot to become a victim and sell it to an audience), the impact of lighting and music and tools like flashbacks, and the underlying terror that has to be there when you find yourself listening to a tape recorder or a doll that holds the keys to your survival and you have a game unlike anything I would ever want to play. and seeing the places where all of these games have taken place and the extent to which planning goes into everything and it is impressive. Even the first kill, one that happens because someone really doesn't listen, is good stuff. And i love it - i love it a lot.If you watch Saw, watch them in order. They stack together well, and the plot that expands through-out the series is one to keep track of. Seeing how the helpers become involved, seeing the different type of handywork, and seeing why tests are given oftentime build over time. Even some of the people who fail are added into newer tests, so you count anything out. I personally like all of that, and i like how Jigsaw has some of the greatest lines in this new realm of horror movies. Even the 5th installment, which would normally be bad in any other series, is great here.I love them all.",5,Emtombing the ones you Loathe.,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,3142,"['games', 'have', 'just', 'begun', 'was', 'credo', 'empowered', 'Jigsaw', 'killer', 'also', 'truth', 'onkeeping', 'Even', 'what', 'happened', 'Jigsaw', 'last', 'test', 'gave', 'former', 'employee', 'partner', 'want', 'call', 'Jigsaw', 'still', 'voice', 'hands', 'do', 'dirty', 'deeds', 'also', 'thing', 'police', 'officers', 'been', 'explained', 'vivid', 'detail', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'pieced', 'together', 'game', 'being', 'played', 'well', 'one', 'working', 'together', 'one', 'team', 'people', 'placed', 'horror', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'lovely', 'part', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'People', 'are', 'such', 'bad', 'listeners', 'just', 'play', 'tape', 'take', 'game', 'seriously', 'lives', 'traps', 'here', 'are', 'nasty', 'little', 'things', 'too', 'are', 'loveingly', 'deceptive', 'al', 'low', 'people', 'see', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'give', 'freedom', 'choose', 'perhaps', 'there', 'freedom', 'choice', 'people', 'mmake', 'worse', 'mistakes.As', 'Jigsaw', 'would', 'say', 'let', 'games', 'begin.I', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'movies', 'well', 'thought', 'were', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'overcoming', 'things', 'budgetary', 'confines', 'utilizing', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'saw', 'puppet', 'things', 'make', 'flesh', 'quiver', 'also', 'have', 'traps', 'have', 'duality', 'stamped', 'very', 'being', 'duality', 'games', 'become', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'when', 'are', 'fact', 'measure', 'other', 'items', 'always', 'liked', 'enjoying', 'fact', 'people', 'are', 'challenged', 'see', 'world', 'different', 'ways', 'people', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'means', 'liberation', 'ones', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'fair', 'almost', 'unfairly', 'doing', 'things', 'people', 'way', 'out', 'see', 'exactly', 'how', 'answers', 'are', 'brutal', 'unfair', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'Combine', 'acting', 'prowess', 'individuals', 'involved', 'think', 'lot', 'become', 'victim', 'sell', 'audience', 'impact', 'lighting', 'music', 'tools', 'flashbacks', 'underlying', 'terror', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'find', 'listening', 'tape', 'recorder', 'doll', 'keys', 'survival', 'have', 'game', 'anything', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'play', 'seeing', 'places', 'where', 'games', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'extent', 'planning', 'everything', 'impressive', 'Even', 'first', 'kill', 'one', 'someone', 'really', ""n't"", 'listen', 'good', 'stuff', 'i', 'love', 'i', 'love', 'lot.If', 'watch', 'Saw', 'watch', 'order', 'stack', 'together', 'well', 'plot', 'series', 'one', 'keep', 'track', 'Seeing', 'how', 'helpers', 'become', 'involved', 'seeing', 'different', 'type', 'handywork', 'seeing', 'why', 'tests', 'are', 'given', 'oftentime', 'build', 'time', 'Even', 'people', 'who', 'fail', 'are', 'added', 'newer', 'tests', 'count', 'anything', 'out', 'personally', 'i', 'how', 'Jigsaw', 'greatest', 'lines', 'new', 'realm', 'horror', 'movies', 'Even', '5th', 'installment', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'bad', 'other', 'series', 'great', 'here.I', 'love']",N/A
1214042,A6T5QGOZ70BJ7,B001L9EXU2,"Vandalgal2006 ""musicaladybug""","[1, 1]","This is yet another ""thinkers"" Saw movie, although not as much as Saw IV. ""Saw V"" is basically the story of detective Mark Hoffman's journey into becoming Jigsaw's accomplice. So there are a lot of flashbacks and back story involved in this interesting chapter of the Saw series. And please do not just plunge in and watch ""Saw V"" without watching the others first. It will make no sense if you do.When the film opens, we're introduced to a murderer named Seth, who is laying on his back and chained down to a table. Above Seth is a pendulum, which will drop down and slowly cut him in half unless he crushes his hands in a device. But this is no ordinary Jigsaw trap and someone is watching this ""game"" unfold. Even though we only see Seth for the opening of the film, you'll find just what a huge impact he makes on the story of ""Saw V."" Personally, the pendulum trap is one of my very favorite Saw traps of them all.Like Saw IV, Saw V is both a prequel and a sequel, picking up right where Saw IV left off and also flashing back for some back story, beginning with the first Saw, all the way up to the current. First of all, from Saw IV, we found out that Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) has been a accomplice to John Kramer/Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) all along. We also saw where agent Peter Strahm (Scott Patterson) found the room where Jigsaw lay dead on the bed with his deceased accomplice Amanda Young below him on the floor. We see Jeff (the grieving father from Saw III) demand to know where his daughter is and Strahm killing him in self defense. And Hoffman shuts and seals the door behind Strahm. So here we have basically Saw III, Saw IV and Saw V linked together here.After surviving the ""cube trap"" (where his head was in a glass cube that fills up with water), agent Strahm is transported to the hospital just as Hoffman emerges from the warehouse carrying Jeff's ""missing"" daughter. Hoffman and Strahm have a brief confrontation at the hospital near agent Perez's bloodied hospital bed, and the cat and mouse game begins from there. Strahm suspects Hoffman is linked to Jigsaw, and so begins his quest to find out the truth to Hoffman's past by sifting through and studying old records and files and visiting the areas where some of the Jigsaw ""games"" took place. Through this, we are taken back to the days when Hoffman met John/Jigsaw and how a huge tragedy in Hoffman's life led him to help out with the kind of horrific ""rehabilitation"" that John Kramer thrived on. One of the best scenes in the movie is of John confronting Hoffman for the first time, using fear tactics and offering him the chance of a lifetime. It is neat to see all the puzzle pieces fitting together and all the gaps filled as we are taken clear back to Saw I, II, and on up to witness Hoffman's hand in the havoc that Jigsaw conducted. While Strahm is investigating, Hoffman stays a step ahead of the game and all the while tries to make it look like Strahm is the one for new-to-the-case detective Dan Erickson (Mark Rolston) to point the finger at.Presently, there are many other things going on as well. Hoffman gets a card the reads ""I know who you are;"" something for the mind to feast on. And Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell), John Kramer's ex-wife, has received a video and a box that he had left for her in the event of his death. But there's more! A new game is being played out known as the ""Fatal Five."" Five people; Brit, Luba, Charles, Mallick and Ashley are responsible for the tragic deaths of 8 people due to their self-centered, unethical actions. Now together they must survive the traps in four rooms. But will they think to use the vital tool of ""teamwork"" to survive? Each room as a timer and nail bombs which will go off when time expires. The first room that they all awaken in contains the ""Necktie Trap"" where they are all in their own locker-sized spaces wearing collars linked together by a string. There are razors mounted in back of them. Five glass boxes with keys inside stand before them and each time a person goes for their key, the string pulls back so tight on the other participants that the razors in back of them could decapitate them. In the next room, we have the ""chamber trap."" There are nail bombs in the corners of the room that will go off when time expires, and there are four chambers that people can climb into for safety. The keys to the chambers are in the glass jars hanging from the ceiling. Who will be the odd person out? The next room has the ""bathtub trap."" Here we have a bathtub full of water. In order to unlock the five locks on the door, the five electrical cords in the room must somehow connect to the bathwater and close the circuits. Finally there's the ""blade trap."" We have a long box-like contraption with five sections with five holes in each section big enough for a hand to fit through. In each section is a saw blade and the challenge is to fill a beaker with 10 pints of blood before time expires or else nail bombs will go off and the doors will be sealed.By the end of the film, the cat and mouse chase between Hoffman and Strahm is about to reach a crescendo complete with an epic ending involving a glass coffin and walls that close in and crush. Yes, it is another great ending for Saw fans. I know when I first watched Saw V, I never saw it coming. More trademark twists. While ""Saw V"" answers a lot of questions, it also leaves you with new questions. It took me a few watches for this particular Saw movie to grow on me a bit, but it's still probably my least favorite of the films. The ""Fatal Five"" game seemed like it was just kind of thrown in there with no real point exactly; perhaps just to show that even though Jigsaw is dead, there are still games being played out. Save Tobin Bell and Costas Mandylor, the acting was not the greatest in the world, but still passable I guess. I gave this movie 4 stars instead of three, just because it does a good job of holding true to the storyline started by the previous movies and everything seemed to come together in the end for a dramatic twist. Overall a decent Saw movie that will leave you thinking again.",4,Hoffman Vs.

1214045,AP3B615GM191G,B001L9EXU2,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 3]","In 2004, the original ""Saw"" film breathed new life into the horror movie genre.  Though enticing viewers with some of the most graphic horror scenes in cinematic history, the real ""hook"" of the film was its morality-play plotline.  Using a tact rarely taken in the annals of horror movies, Saw actually created doubt in the viewers' minds as to whether the ""victims"" were exactly that.  Though perverse, the demented Jigsaw killer was doling out justice in a seminal way that everyone can relate to (even if it horrifies their ""good side"").With each subsequent film, however, that magic has been lost, little by little.  While Saw II just fed off the hype of the original and didn't mess with the formula and Saw III was interesting for the ""dying Jigsaw"" plotline, the two most recent installments have failed to recapture that spark of the ""original trilogy"".  Saw IV was just outright confusing, while this film suffers from two major maladies:First, the departure from the tried-and-true formula of regular citizens being tested in their weakest area.  Like I said, the strength of the first few Saw movies was the writers' abilities to make audiences think about the morality of what was reality transpiring.  This film, however, doesn't really take that tact and instead just focuses on clearing up all the loose ends from the fourth release.  Though perhaps a noble cause for hard-core Saw fans, this line of storytelling only served to irritate me, as Saw IV was where I saw the series begin going downhill and thus didn't want to go in that direction again.The other notable departure is a moving away from the Jigsaw character.  To me, Jigsaw is at the very heart of what the Saw franchise is all about, and the series really isn't active unless he is in it.  The flashbacks in IV were interesting, but Jigsaw's presence in V just seemed to be an excuse to bring back Tobin Bell, not to advance the plot in any meaningful way.Thus, I see the Saw franchise as being at a paradox right now.  One direction would be to continue on with the ""Jigsaw lineage"" and further dilute the original material (the likely path in order to please the die-hard scrutinizers), while the other, more inventive approach would be to come up with something new.
