1419522,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B004LXBKEC,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 2]","MEGAN IS MISSING is the story of two 14-year-old best friends who, within three weeks of each other, both fall prey to the same internet predator.  Told through video chat logs, video diaries and news reports, we watch the story of shy, reserved Amy Herman and her best friend, outgoing party girl Megan Stewart over the course of a month, during January of 2007.Through another friend, Megan meets SKATERDUDE online, a guy named Josh who Megan thinks is a pretty decent guy.  She agrees to meet him for ice cream one evening, and is never heard from again.  Amy tells the police Megan had made plans to see ""Josh"", and ""Josh"" doesn't take kindly to this, so he threatens Amy to leave him alone.  A few days later, Amy turns up missing as well.The plot of MEGAN IS MISSING is very simple, and I'm quite sure is meant as a warning to parents and children about the dangers of the internet and how easily kids and teens can fall victim to online predators.  Unfortunately, this is such a bad movie, the point becomes lost in a quagmire of terrible dialogue delivered through bad acting and a third act that is nothing but a gratuitous re-enactment of a fetishist's wet dream.Michael Goi wrote and directed the movie and while I'm sure there are plenty of older people out there who have an ear for teen dialogue, this particular 52-year-old does not.  I didn't even need to check imdb to know that whoever wrote this was nowhere near the age these girls are supposed to be.  Every line sounds like it was written by someone whose only connection to the teenage crowd is through teen movies.But maybe a decent cast could have at least read this nonsense in a convincing enough way it didn't ring so false, or at least helped Goi to rewrite some of the dialogue so it didn't sound so forced.  That's what a decent cast could have maybe done.  This wasn't a decent cast.I've no doubt in real life Amber Perkins and Rachel Quinn are fantastic people, but the acting here left SO much to be desired.  Hey, maybe it's because Perkins was in her early 20s trying to play 14.  That could be a contributing factor, early 20s, badly-written 14-year-old dialogue, it's not a winning combination no matter how talented an actress is in that role.  And I find it hard to believe that out of everyone in this fairly large cast of supposed-to-be-high schoolers, there wasn't one good actor.  But the evidence on film doesn't support that theory.  If you're going by what's onscreen, Goi grabbed a bunch of people off the street, showed them the lines and said, ""Action!"" without bothering to make sure they knew how to read.The law of averages aside, Perkins and Quinn were the stars, and by the time we get to a scene in the movie where they're allowed to stop reciting this ridiculous dialogue and have to actually emote and show range, we've already sat through over an hour of tediousness and we just don't care anymore.Then there's that final 22 minutes.  Amy was abducted while filming her video diary, talking about missing Megan.  And the final 22 minutes of the movie is supposed to be the unedited footage recorded by her kidnapper.  The scenes of her captivity, torture, rape and murder add absolutely nothing to the story.  In fact, ending on her abduction may have offered the film a chance at redemption by actually going out on a dramatic moment, leaving us wondering just as Amy's and Megan's parents were left wondering.To force us through the blow by blow of Amy's ordeal doesn't make us feel for Amy, it just makes us not like the director any more than we already didn't in the first place.I'm sure the argument of ""but it's reality"" could be thrown in there somewhere; lots of people film their crimes for whatever reason.  But as a story element, it offers nothing.MEGAN IS MISSING is billed as a horror movie, but don't be fooled.  This is exploitation, pure and simple.  There's no moral, there's no character development, there's not even a lesson to be learned in the end.  If I had to guess, I'd say Goi saw a story on the news about abducted kids and thought it would be interesting to see what happens to the kid after the abduction.  But you can't just have a movie of nothing but torture and rape, you have to have characters to root for.  So let's write a movie about two best friends who both have the same incredibly bad fortune to fall prey to the same guy.  Then we show them being tortured and raped and, since we got to know them, the audience will then sympathize even more.Nope, that didn't work out so well.  It's not a totally terrible idea for a cautionary tale, but I think for a cautionary tale to really work, you have to not cringe at every line out of the characters' mouths.  This is an idea that could possibly work in the right hands, it just wasn't these hands, unfortunately.",2,Megan is Missing,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,4811,"['MEGAN', 'IS', 'MISSING', 'story',

Clearly is a grave threat, especially toward young people unaware of the realities.My challenge in enjoying this movie was in its pace and believability.  Its frankly very slow and takes at least 50%, if not more of the movie before anything of substance starts to occur.  Everything else is meaningless teen chatter, albeit with some preachy, socially deviant behavior.  Then, the story focuses largely on a group of girls that do just about everything wrong - bad relationships with their parents, promiscuity, drinking and drug use, etc.  Clearly the film is trying to send a message, but I'm not sure an 1.5 hour movie is the best medium for it, especially given the numerous PSAs we're bombarded with frequently on the topic.On a positive note, the movie was shot with a creative flair.  Almost all of the footage is reproduced (seemingly) from video chat footage, so the screens are often split (as you observe the live video chat), or from hand-held camcorders.

1419525,A3OL5FNSXR723K,B004LXBKEC,Cinemaguy,"[12, 19]","Megan Stewart, 14, and her best friend Amy Herman, 13, though opposites in personality, are best friends. Megan carries the front of being the most popular girl in school, but this masks a lifestyle of hard partying, drugs, alcohol and indiscriminate sex. Amy, unpopular and socially awkward, clings to her relationship with Megan as a lifeline to social acceptance. Together, these two young girls forge a deep friendship based on their mutual needs. Using all the technology accessible for meeting people and chatting, the two girls regularly communicate by webchat cameras or cell phone, and even meet boys online. As Megan seeks friends who are different from her usual posse of hanger-ons, she meets a 17 year-old boy named Josh in a chat room. Megan and Josh bond quickly, leaving Amy feeling a bit left out. One day, Megan goes to meet Josh in person, and she is never seen again. Amy launches into a concentrated effort to find her friend. Josh is initially sympathetic to Amy's efforts, then begins to be abusive to her online. As the media swirls around the story of Megan's disappearance, Amy suddenly disappears as well. The movie plunges you into the hell of the real world as seen through the eyes of a child.Based on seven actual cases, MEGAN IS MISSING is an uncompromising, gut-wrenching view of the world children live in today. Harrowing in its realism, the film uses only fact-based incidences to depict the lives of ordinary kids walking in the midst of extraordinary evil. I saw this film at a screening in New York, and it is simply the most disturbing movie you will ever see. There is a party scene that feels like the cameras just drifted into a real party and recorded all the sex and drinking that kids do when they lie to their parents about where they are at night. It is impossible to forget, and once you get over the shock of what you've experienced (and experienced is exactly the right word, because the movie is filmed in such a way that it makes you feel that it's happening NOW) you start looking at your own life and your own neighborhood in a different way. There are news broadcasts in the film that look just like you've turned on the TV in your house and there's a story about an abducted child. And without giving too much about the ending away (although the very beginning of the film has a title card which explains exactly what will happen in the film, and you are still shocked when it does happen), the final moments of the film leave you feeling so horrified and numb that I forgot to take a breath.The two young actresses in the film, Amber Perkins (who I believe is the niece of actress Elizabeth Perkins) who plays Amy and Rachel Quinn who plays Megan, give such realistic performances that it is sometimes difficult to believe that they are performers and not real people. You never really see the man who is their predator, but his presence is creepy. This is a film about children which is definitely NOT for children to see. It is unrated, but would definitely be an NC-17 or a very strong R.The DVD is widescreen (1.78) and anamorphically enhanced. There are many split-screen sequences in the film when the girls are talking to each other on their cell phones or on the computer, so you can see both sides of the conversation at the same time. The sound is in stereo without prominent surrounds, which is in keeping with the style of the movie. There is a director's commentary track where he talks about all the actual events that inspired the scenes in the film, a producer and cast commentary track where the young actresses discuss how they felt about performing difficult scenes, a deleted scene, cast interviews and a video interview with Marc Klaas, whose daughter Polly Klaas was abducted and murdered. He talks about why the film made an impression on him and what parents can do to safeguard their children in this age of electronic communication.",5,The Most Disturbing Film You Will Ever See,1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,3916,"['Megan', 'Stewart', '14', 'best', 'friend', 'Amy', 'Herman', '13', 'though', 'personality', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'Megan', 'front', 'being', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'lifestyle', 'hard', 'partying', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'indiscriminate', 'sex', 'Amy', 'unpopular', 'socially', 'awkward', 'clings', 'relationship', 'Megan', 'lifeline', 'social', 'acceptance', 'Together', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'forge', 'deep', 'friendship', 'based', 'mutual', 'needs', 'Using', 'technology', 'accessible', 'meeting', 'people', 'chatting', 'two', 'girls', 'regularly', 'communicate', 'webchat', 'cameras', 'cell', 'phone', 'even', 'meet', 'boys', 'online', 'Megan', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'usual', 'posse', 'hanger-ons', '17', 'year-old', 'boy', 'named', 'Josh', 'chat', 'room', 'Megan', 'Josh', 'bond', 'quickly', 'leaving', 'Amy', 'feeling', 'bit', 'left', 'out', 'One', 'day', 'Megan', 'meet', 'Josh', 'person', 'never', 'seen', 'again', 'Amy', 'concentrated', 'effort', 'find', 'friend', 'Josh', 'initially', 'sympathetic', 'Amy', 'efforts', 'then', 'be', 'abusive', 'online', 'media', 'swirls', 'story', 'Megan', 'disappearance', 'Amy', 'suddenly', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'hell', 'real', 'world', 'seen', 'eyes', 'child.Based', 'seven', 'actual', 'cases', 'MEGAN', 'IS', 'MISSING', 'uncompromising', 'gut-wrenching', 'view', 'world', 'children', 'live', 'today', 'Harrowing', 'realism', 'film', 'only', 'fact-based', 'incidences', 'depict', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'kids', 'walking', 'midst', 'extraordinary', 'evil', 'saw', 'film', 'screening', 'New', 'York', 'simply', 'most', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'party', 'scene', 'cameras', 'just', 'drifted', 'real', 'party', 'recorded', 'sex', 'drinking', 'kids', 'do', 'when', 'lie', 'parents', 'where', 'are', 'night', 'impossible', 'forget', 'once', 'get', 'shock', 'what', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'experienced', 'exactly', 'right', 'word', 'movie', 'filmed', 'such', 'way', 'feel', 'happening', 'NOW', 'start', 'looking', 'own', 'life', 'own', 'neighborhood', 'different', 'way', 'are', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'film', 'just', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'TV', 'house', 'story', 'abducted', 'child', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'ending', 'away', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'title', 'card', 'exactly', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'shocked', 'when', 'happen', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'leave', 'feeling', 'so', 'horrified', 'numb', 'forgot', 'take', 'breath.The', 'two', 'young', 'actresses', 'film', 'Amber', 'Perkins', 'who', 'believe', 'niece', 'actress', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'who', 'Amy', 'Rachel', 'Quinn', 'who', 'Megan', 'give', 'such', 'realistic', 'performances', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'believe', 'are', 'performers', 'not', 'real', 'people', 'never', 'really', 'see', 'man', 'who', 'predator', 'presence', 'creepy', 'film', 'children', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'children', 'see', 'unrated', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'NC-17', 'very', 'strong', 'R.The', 'DVD', 'widescreen', '1.78', 'anamorphically', 'enhanced', 'are', 'many', 'split-screen', 'sequences', 'film', 'when', 'girls', 'are', 'talking', 'other', 'cell', 'phones', 'computer', 'can', 'see', 'sides', 'conversation', 'same', 'time', 'sound', 'stereo', 'prominent', 'surrounds', 'keeping', 'style', 'movie', 'director', 'commentary', 'track', 'where', 'actual', 'events', 'inspired', 'scenes', 'film', 'producer', 'cast', 'commentary', 'track', 'where', 'young', 'actresses', 'discuss', 'how', 'felt', 'performing', 'difficult', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'scene', 'cast', 'interviews', 'video', 'interview', 'Marc', 'Klaas', 'daughter', 'Polly', 'Klaas', 'was', 'abducted', 'murdered', 'why', 'film', 'made', 'impression', 'what', 'parents', 'can', 'do', 'safeguard', 'children', 'age', 'electronic', 'communication']",Megan Is Missing

1419527,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B004LXBKEC,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 6]","Megan is Missing is a really powerful movie that leaves an indelible impression on the viewer.  It's a strange film, but the final twenty-odd minutes are downright chilling and very, very disturbing.  I knew nothing about this movie going in to it, and for a while I thought the filmmaker was just using the idea of Internet predators in another bid to cash in on the reality-based movie craze (the film consists of ""found footage"" from webcams, cell phones, and videotapes).  Well before the end, though, it was crystal clear that this was not the case.  Megan is Missing is, as they say, as serious as a heart attack - even more serious than that, really, because a heart attack is a natural event.  There is nothing natural about the fates of Megan and her friend Amy in this movie.  The most awful thing about it all is the fact that every incident in this film is based on an actual event - not one single event, but a conglomeration of a number of different child abduction cases.  It is truly horrifying to know that everything that happened to these girls did actually happen to one or more poor children.The story revolves around two best friends: 14-year-olds Megan (Rachel Quinn) and Amy (Amber Perkins).  The girls could not be more different - Megan is a bit of a wild child who has already experimented with drugs and sex, while Amy is mousy, virginal, and inhibited - but their friendship is very real.  The two talk numerous times each day over cell phones, webcams, and in person.  Amy wishes she could be as uninhibited as Megan, while Megan longs for the stable family life that Amy enjoys.  One of the things Megan likes to do is to chat with boys over the Internet, and it is there that she ""meets"" Josh.  Josh's webcam is conveniently broken, but he certainly seems like a nice guy.  Finding him intriguing, Megan accepts his invitation to meet up behind a local diner - and that's the last anyone sees or hears from her.  In the days following Megan's disappearance, Amy makes a number of video diaries and works up the gumption to contact Josh herself, who tells her that Megan never showed up to meet him.  Then, three weeks after Megan's disappearance - which has since been revealed by the diner's security camera to be an abduction - Amy too disappears.  That is when the movie takes a truly chilling turn.I would encourage viewers to go to the film's web site and read the statement from Marc Klaas and the message from writer/director Michael Goi about why and how he made this movie.  It was Goi's intention to make this film about Internet predators as realistic as possible - and he definitely succeeded in doing just that.  The conversations and partying activities of Megan and her circle of friends that dominate the first part of the movie may seem shocking (they certainly shocked me), but they are all based on the actual conversations of some of Goi's friends' daughters (who actually allowed Goi to listen in on their conversations).  As for all the young teens cast for the movie, Goi insisted that their parents read the script and be on set during filming.  Most importantly, as I mentioned earlier, all of the bad things that happen in the film are based on actual events taken from a number of true crimes.

1419528,A1H0DVDALK4APZ,B004LXBKEC,Darrell A. Lane,"[8, 11]","What I find most disturbing about Megan is Missing is the apparently lack of cognitive ability in the audience to discern fiction (not true, made up story) from non-fiction (based on a true story with factual references) or the new category of faction (a work of fiction created to look like a true story, which this movie is). Folks, snuff films are illegal in the US of A; the participation, transportation, sell and possession of snuff films is illegal. If this were a snuff film Amazon certainly wouldn't be selling it. The interesting fact about this film is that so many people have such violent, emotional responses after seeing it, claiming that it was too much to see (and so on). The filmmakers obviously did well enough of a job. I liked it. I've known quite a few adult women with the same sheeplike traits as the girls in this movie; those traits come from somewhere, possibly their own teen years. Accept it, we live in an uncivilized, brutal world. Every aspect of the human condition is violent that's why we have security measures, laws, cops and military. Man is the most violent predator on the planet, which is how we got to the top of the food chain. Wealth, sex, war and food are all competed for in the human condition. The moment you forget that is the moment you open yourself up to victimhood.Okay, enough philosophizing; let's look at Megan is Missing: both Amber Perkins and Rachel Quinn (who are both still alive and working on other projects, check IMDb) were very good at portraying the crude, semi-educated American female of the 21st Century; the drug culture, though a bit dramatic on the reality side, was harsh and brutal, and even included the creepy dregs of male society that rely heavily on drugs to get laid. Graphic depiction? Not really; this movie has a meta moment in which the vapid media re-inact Megan's abduction, revealing the level of reality of the movie itself...a re-inactment. There was even an actress mimicking Nancy Grace's loony, cliche overacting.Out of all the ""found footage"" movies this one isn't all that bad; no more or less than the Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, REC, Paranormal Activity and Paranormal Entity. I prefer a narrative, cinematic film to found footage, but it's all good.The great grandaddy of found footage would be the 1939 radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds, in which people believed the story so well that they actually panicked and fled cities (blame it on sound effects and the mind's ability to elaborate on spoken...and, today,on visual...information).Returning to my original statement: it's only a movie.

This adds to the loathsomeness level by convincing some folks, somehow, that there's a lesson here in this exploitive garbage, that teenage girls are really asking for it by being stupid, and that if said teenaged girls would only be more careful they wouldn't wind up dead, raped, and buried alive in a barrel with the dead body of their friend.Some commenters have defended this swill by shrugging, too bad, so sad, it's a big bad world out there full of rapists, molesters, and murderers, and that girls should watch their step and.....act like they live in Afghanistan, it seems. Funny thing is, if it's possible to makae these ""PSA"" movies are more than one self righteous twit called it,  then it's possible to nip this kind of crap in the bud, so to speak, with men and boys.  Every time some slimebag makes a movie lovingly detailing violence fetishes for the paying masses, well, he could making one detailing what happens to rapists who kidnap and murder girls. But they never do. And yet the message here is supposedly that this is GOOD to show what'll happen to those slutty little girlies who meet boys and party.I tend to like pseudo documentaries, but this one is vile,  more for the self righteous tone than for technical merits. It's not a PSA. It's basically a porn movie where the clothes stay on and the kink of choice is torturing little girls and then self righteously claiming it's for a good cause, or for their own good. This is not an old concept. Moviemakers have been claiming that they're doing it for womens' own good for decades. Oh, if only those stupid silly women and girls would stop putting themselves in danger! Funny how all these movies focus on stranger danger and not the fact that women and girls are most often attacked by known acquaintances, not strangers.There's no way to guard against that, but if you focus on the rarest form of attack against women and girls, you wind up with this dreck,  while millions of girls get raped and abused and murdered by their supposed loved ones every year, not kidnapped by some dude with an elaborate dungeon set up.I agree with the great Pauline Kael, who reached her boiling point after yet another detailed rape scene on screen that had male critics raving about how great the film was when she said she wanted to make a movie showing men being hurt and tortured while having the whole world call it art, shredding the pretenses that allow sexist drivel like this to find an audience.",1,"Exploitive and hypocritical; spare me the sanctimony, thanks",1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,2630,"['Torture', 'porn', 'rage', 'days', 'talentless', 'hacks', 'trying', 'top', 'one', 'ways', 'abuse', 'strip', 'torture', 'pretty', 'young', 'screaming', 'women', 'loathsomeness', 'level', 'convincing', 'folks', 'somehow', 'lesson', 'here', 'exploitive', 'garbage', 'teenage', 'girls', 'are', 'really', 'asking', 'being', 'stupid', 'said', 'teenaged', 'girls', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'more', 'careful', 'would', ""n't"", 'wind', 'up', 'dead', 'raped', 'buried', 'alive', 'barrel', 'dead', 'body', 'friend.Some', 'commenters', 'have', 'defended', 'swill', 'shrugging', 'too', 'bad', 'so', 'sad', 'big', 'bad', 'world', 'there', 'full', 'rapists', 'molesters', 'murderers', 'girls', 'should', 'watch', 'step', '..act', 'live', 'Afghanistan', 'Funny', 'thing', 'possible', 'makae', 'PSA', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'one', 'self', 'righteous', 'twit', 'called', 'then', 'possible', 'nip', 'kind', 'crap', 'bud', 'so', 'speak', 'men', 'boys', 'time', 'slimebag', 'movie', 'lovingly', 'detailing', 'violence', 'fetishes', 'paying', 'masses', 'well', 'could', 'making', 'one', 'detailing', 'what', 'rapists', 'who', 'kidnap', 'murder', 'girls', 'never', 'do', 'yet', 'message', 'here', 'supposedly', 'GOOD', 'show', 'what', ""'ll"", 'happen', 'slutty', 'little', 'girlies', 'who', 'meet', 'boys', 'party.I', 'tend', 'like', 'pseudo', 'documentaries', 'one', 'vile', 'more', 'self', 'righteous', 'tone', 'technical', 'merits', 'not', 'PSA', 'basically', 'porn', 'movie', 'where', 'clothes', 'stay', 'kink', 'choice', 'torturing', 'little', 'girls', 'then', 'self', 'righteously', 'claiming', 'good', 'cause', 'own', 'good', 'not', 'old', 'concept', 'Moviemakers', 'have', 'been', 'claiming', ""'re"", 'doing', 'womens', 'own', 'good', 'decades', 'Oh', 'only', 'stupid', 'silly', 'women', 'girls', 'would', 'stop', 'putting', 'danger', 'Funny', 'how', 'movies', 'focus', 'stranger', 'danger', 'not', 'fact', 'women', 'girls', 'are', 'most', 'often', 'attacked', 'known', 'acquaintances', 'not', 'way', 'guard', 'focus', 'rarest', 'form', 'attack', 'women', 'girls', 'wind', 'up', 'dreck', 'millions', 'girls', 'get', 'raped', 'abused', 'murdered', 'supposed', 'loved', 'ones', 'year', 'not', 'kidnapped', 'dude', 'elaborate', 'dungeon', 'set', 'up.I', 'agree', 'great', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'who', 'reached', 'boiling', 'point', 'yet', 'detailed', 'rape', 'scene', 'screen', 'had', 'male', 'critics', 'raving', 'how', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'when', 'said', 'wanted', 'make', 'movie', 'showing', 'men', 'being', 'hurt', 'tortured', 'having', 'whole', 'world', 'call', 'shredding', 'pretenses', 'allow', 'sexist', 'drivel', 'find', 'audience']",Megan Is Missing

Wingenfeld ""warholhorror""","[1, 1]","I came very close to turning off Megan is Missing after ten or fifteen minutes just because the acting was so bad and the characters so annoying.  I decided to stick it out and am glad I did, as this wound up being a very effective and disturbing movie.  It is riddled with problems, however.As the two main characters Amy and Megan, Amber Perkins and Rachel Quinn turn in outstanding performances once they are allowed to do so.  Much of the dialog early on in the film seems stilted and unnatural.  Instead of simply having the actors improvise, it seems to me that dialog was written to mimic the mannerisms of tween girls by a writer who doesn't really know how tween girls talk.  It takes a while for Perkins and Quinn to inhabit their roles but they finally do so and once the movie is focusing only on them their performances shine.  During some frank and uncomfortable scenes in which Megan confides in Amy her first sexual experiences and abuse at the hands of her stepfather the two actresses are completely convincing, even moving.Another problem is that this movie is supposed to be being told through reconstructed footage shot via a digital video camera, cell phones and webcams, yet all the footage appears to have been shot with the same camera.  This unfortunately takes away from the authenticity of the footage, as do some clumsy fake news reports that suffer from inappropriate attempts at satire and dark humor.The characters that populate the first quarter of the movie are insufferably obnoxious and at first make it tough to sit through.  Who wants to hang out with this bunch of self-absorbed, loud-mouth children?  It took me a while to realize that this was the point.  Megan's poor choice of friends and her miserable home life have forced her to find solace in the form of an anonymous stranger who showers her with compliments and affection.  She gets the same from her flesh and blood friend Amy, but Amy can't fulfill her longing for romance.  This is the weakness (for lack of a better word) online predators use to lure their prey.  As difficult as getting through those first few scenes was, they worked.Overall, Megan is Missing is an uneven but ultimately effective movie.  The finale is as unbearably intense as it is heartbreaking.  I definitely recommend this movie to fans of found footage horror.

So I figured I better watch and see for myself.Honestly the first hour is painfully boring. Its two teenage girls standing in front of cell phones or cameras talking. (all of this movie is ""found footage"" from cell phones, web cams, etc. so get used to it) Some parts they discuss first time sexual activities, or being molested. Honestly pretty disturbing for someone of my age (30) to listen to as the girls in the movie are 14/15 years old. Now, if I was their age, I wouldn't have been uncomfortable really listening to them talk like this because I'd relate to their age group, but instead it was pretty disturbing and I found myself wondering what I was really in store for.The movie starts to get a little funny. I know, its wrong of me to be laughing about it, because it is a serious issue, this sort of thing really did/does happen, and this movie was based on a few different real cases. But the problem is that the writing in this and the acting during certain scenes were just hilarious even without trying to be. Or maybe it was trying to make you laugh during this specific scene (the scene where they show, and reenact the abduction of Megan) just so they can shock you in the next shot. With a few still ""horrific"" images. Here I am laughing about this scene and these images pop up and I shut off the movie. I was alone, late at night, kinda scared of what they'd show next. Now, later I looked online or these images, and they weren't that bad, creepy, but I guess just within the context of the movie at that moment they freaked me out.I did turn the movie back on. But I was creeped out from that point on as really that's where it turns into ""horror"".While the overall acting, story, etc, was pretty lame. I felt as a first watch the ending made up for it as it did spook me out. However, that doesn't mean it's a great movie by any means. I would never watch it again because it was painfully boring for the most part.

The movie really is a slow burner, you have to sit through all the drama of a teenage girl for about an hour.  The character development is OK though.  Listening to some of the dialogue of the teens is quite disturbing though, I really wonder if that's what they talk about.After enduring all of this you come to the last 25 minutes of this movie.  Literally the most disturbing piece of film I think I have ever seen.  I though Cannibal Holocaust had some twisted and shocking scenes.  It has nothing on this.  You really do feel a sense of disgust and some guilt for watching this.I'm sure this kind of stuff happens everyday somewhere in the world and that's why this movie is so eve opening.

1419539,AETEH7SOTOFRT,B004LXBKEC,KittyScratchesBooks,"[0, 1]","I researched the *****SPOILERS******** and I have this to say. Because of what the spoilers described, I will watch it because I have not experienced the film and the &#34;spoilers&#34; do not bother me (from an entirely different era of thinking--though NOT from THIS era of thinking...Thank GOODNESS.....anyway, some of the reviews (SOME) were not helpful because so many of them wanted this to be a Lifetime Movie Event/ Disney &#34;DD&#34; feature where smart-ass back talking girls gain victory in the end. This is about REAL LIFE. I would not be looking to spend money on what any of us can watch on today's BS cable.I was not looking for that. I was looking for some one to take a chance on telling the truth. I am looking for someone finally, to tell these girls that this is NOT going to work. That mean girl mess can only get you so far in the real world.Somethings DO remain the same, like, at the end of the cute, mean girl, shallow talk, a young man will want a wife in the end, or a real woman. You can act and look like little miss &#34;Hayley&#34; and the airbrush half naked, high pitched pre-recorded voice whiner over the radio (that unoriginal music that sounds like the same girl is singing the same lyrics over and over again) with the exact same part on the exact same side of the hair with the platinum blonde rinse and those terrible &#34;hoe sandalled&#34; heels with low riders (I can go on , but won't because they know the look and it simply gags).Every girl even looks the same in the movie as in real life. Guys get bored with this eventually, it is all a fad for a minute and when the rubber meets the road, it's like NEXT!!!Also, I completely disagree with anyone who believes that this is how girls behaved at 14. I would like to say, please ONLY  refer to those born AFTER 1980 because 14 year olds WERE not  REMOTELY compared to acting like this AT ALL, not even on a typical national level back in the 70s or 80s.SURE there were levels of immaturity, but the 14 year old boys and girls TODAY are EXTREMELY immature, they truly, truly are.The girls in THIS film, I nearly mistaken them to be at least 11-12. At 14 (in the 60s-late 80s) would not dare act this ignorantly and this loud (not even APART from our parents because parents were more mature and our communities were more mature and it was ALWAYS that our parents found out almost supernaturally&#34; whether you acted an ass at a party or in the public.In our generation, there was NO WAY a young lady could get away with acting as these girls behaved. If any of us had, the entire community and the school would instantly brand you a whore (not questions asked and no explanations accepted) I mean that. You can bring another person in my age group on here and they will mirror the same sentiment and not ever read this review from me.Young ladies just did not carry on this way using the N word and referring to their OWN behaviours and upbringing to THEIR OWN era or race. The use of the N word from THEIR mouths (any mouth) but so casually spoken is what makes them less than zero.Young ladies did not speak this way, not any female in our generation of ANY race would have spoken as these girls and they are girls and not young ladies, in this film. It would have been a useless film if it were about being socially ignorant and completely uneducated as these girls behave.The true HORROR of this film is that this is a nationally acceptable way of life for a 14 year old. The era in which we were raised, our community and our schools prepared us towards a mature expectation of behaviour in High School. This was crucial for all of us at that time.Today's girls (and this is highlighted significantly) are poorly raised mistaking &#34;strong&#34; or &#34;mature&#34; for loud and needing a harness with a pull chain.Parents are as frustrating blind about their child's behaviour. The parents today are okay with their children having an arrest record and tats and not being encouraged to move towards college prep or become a young person with a goal and skills even if they did not choose college.The era before the kids born between 1980 and present are super lost, technology has nearly destroyed them, they are precocious and and sexually bold (believe me this is not a great badge of honour).It reflects where this society has spiralled and only those born between 1960 to 1977(1980 is even pushing it, because it would have truly began at those born in 1979.These girls are a product of a already fallen and dysfunction society and the grand parents (not 30 year old grandparents) grand parents who are in their mid 60s would not relate to their own children acting or being raised in this way.Watching the clips were even achingly awful because I could not even sympathise with the girls or their generation. Their behaviours need not warrant my feeling bad for their current way of thought process.If our children behaved as foul mouthed, disgusting and appalling as ANY of these kids, we truly would relocate OUT of the West or send them far away to a boarding school where they teach the guidelines of real life and groom them into responsible and pleasant human beings. Our children do not have to be inventors of the next problem making device for society and make billions or millions.Today, all that we would want for our children is to be content with being their age, not having sex as if it were going to the cinema (don't get us wrong, we romantically and sexually interested young people as well) but you could count the whores--- both boys and girls--- on one hand and everyone knew them. And what was &#34;whorish&#34; back then is NOTHING to how it is today.Today, it is free for all and all of them are whorish in their mannerisms, the way they address their parents, the stealing, the back talk (the back talk and the loudness was enough to disown a kid in our days because they were considered a delinquent and a embarrassment and a criminal).Young women who were 14 in High School... 25-30 years BEFORE THIS generation.... weren't allowed to dress in their underwear and call it an outfit and if they tried, at least they had two sets of clothing and tried to do this away from the community (this is NOT recommended either).Madonna DID start the whore underwear journey WAY before and the young ladies wanted the sexual appeal, but they did NOT strip into their camisoles and dare have their nipples showing (they wore TWO camisoles, a real bra and the faded jean jacket to where it was cute lacy and mysterious with LEGGINGS). Never revealing.These were the days before it was in vogue to not have a father growing up. This was BEFORE the &#34;baby's daddy&#34; lingo. And this was not only &#34;suburban&#34; teens acting appropriate in our generation; normal teens all over the US were never like today's kids.If they were, their community would pitch in and help because it meant that the teen needed special help and possibly meds.The girls today are straight up the girls from LA red light districts that we used to laugh about and disconnect from; because if you acted like her, you got into HER kind of trouble meaning... pregnant and it was even rare to BE pregnant at 14 in the 80s (there were 2 or 3 girl in the entire and even THEY were at least about to graduate, they were treated with respect, and was it was STILL worrisome ENOUGH that they had to take separate classes so that the rest of the teenagers would not view this as typical or a mistaken option). Being pregnant was one of our main issues of concern because this was not the goal compared to NOW.We were NEVER to mistreat or make them to be an outcast when we saw them, but it was an unspoken social function which spoke loud and clear that this was NOT the option. The mile shock would be (and let me repeat MILD shock .....would be to get pregnant at 17 and the average young lady was SCARED to get pregnant at 17---we had enough sex-ed and ABC After school Specials to warn us about this and sex and the music...it was enough to only make out and for the boys to be grateful with a handful under the shirt and keep the shirt on because we were THAT scared that to LOOK at a penis meant you may have missed your period.So, I will purchase this movie, but only for the content that this is based on a true story and not to think that ANY of the behaviour in this film is adorable or even remotely humorous.The language is trashy and the girls behave and are WAY younger acting than 14. This entire generation would be considered yesterday's losers to act this way during our teen years.These things are not meant to insult, but it was an entirely different time. I was appalled by the difference and any sympathy was embarrassed FOR them and not in spite of it.There is no excuse for a 14 year old to act this horribly and if this is the kind of future than any of us are looking towards where young folks act THIS nasty, then we are ALL in for more than a seat belt. We will need body armour, helmets and possibly WMD if this is what the damned future holds and none of it looks promising at this point.If we witness any 14 year old acting like this, our community today will contact the authorities and then THEY can legally tear their little asses up with much BLESSING; if EVER the young girls or boys are acting this out of control at the mall or on their iPhones (they will be thrown in a compactor with their outfits) in our presence. You can count on it.If this is scary GOOD, it will save the lives of those who need to clean up their mouth and their act and KNOW that their behaviour comes from their HOME and not being &#34;inspired&#34; or &#34;influenced&#34; by another race of people that they repeatedly disrespect with their derogatory mental illness.In fact, they seem as if all of their parents were smoking meth and 1000% proof EVERCLEAR WHILE they were&#34; in vitro&#34;.They cannot blame this new type of 14 year girl based on some videos and another race. THIS is the ignorance of this &#34;new nothingness of a generation&#34;.Watch and learn how NOT to be a potty mouth , slutty little racist whore and then you JUST may make it to your graduation from High School in time to listen to Pomp and Circumstance.",4,By the way.....,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,10242,"['researched', '*****SPOILERS********', 'have', 'say', 'what', 'spoilers', 'described',

1419541,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B004LXBKEC,maskedgamer,"[3, 3]","Megan is missing is the story of two young teenage girls that live in suburbia. Their lives are plagued with the usually teen drama of fitting in, being popular,having sex, doing drugs, going to wild drunken parties, getting into arguments with your parents etc. etc. You know the usual things teens do (except turned up to the 19th power). Megan is an outspoken,pernicious,in crowd party girl, and her best friend Amy is a reserved,nerdy,timid type of girl. The two are complete opposites but their friends because each of them seems to have qualities that the other doesn't. In the film we watch the two girls carry out their adolescent lives and learn more about them and what makes them tick. The first half of the film basically is about character development for the two girls so you get to know them quite a bit. The 2nd half of the film is about why Megan is missing. The film itself feel very low budget with a pretty bad acting cast that makes the movie hard to take seriously (especially for the message they want to portray). If you were patient enough to make it through the ""Teens gone wild"" first half you are rewarded with the more interesting second half of the film.*This part will contain spoilers*After Megan is abducted by means of meeting up with a stranger she met online we get to see hints and clues as to what happened to her. We see her chained up in a basement and we see photo's of her BDSM style. The photo's are shocking or maybe disturbing to some people but honestly in the age of the internet these are pretty mild. The only thing that's shocking about them is that your mind recognizes Megan as a girl that you're familiar with instead of a random victim. When you see her in these ""uncomfortable photo's"" you start to sympathize with her(I actually felt more disturbed with her felicio scene at the teen party). After these incidents that's the last we see of Megan and then the story focuses on Amy who is abducted by the person that kidnapped Megan. We get a better idea of what Megan went through watching Amy's torture unfold as she is chained in a basement, raped,and forced to eat food like an animal. Compared to other movies the second half feels rushed and tries to throw in as much shock value as they can at the veiwer. When the real terror is the psychological trauma that the victim is going through. This is never established in this movie. You don't get to feel what Amy is thinking or the level of despair she is in (even though it's apparent) it's just the poor execution of this part of the film. ""The Girl Next Door"" gives a good idea of the victim coping with the trauma of the situation their in as Meg goes from a strong spirit that can cope with her punishment to a girl that is fading away and has given up and feels she is going to die.""The last house on the left"" (the remake) gives a good example of victim despair when the girl is swimming to her parents home after being raped and she's pretending she's swimming in a pool, instead of swimming for her life from her attackers. This type of mental connection is important because it allows the viewer to put themselves in the place of the victim and gives the story more impact. Shock value is okay as you'll remember being scared but you won't exactly remember how scared the girl was or how hopeless she felt which is what this film wanted to establish. Instead you just have people talking about how ""That Scene"" scared them.Now about ""that scene"" it's probably the most if only brilliant part of this film. At the point were focusing on Amy we have forgotten about Megan as she's long gone out the picture at that point. What happened to her? Where did she go? Where is she?. Well it just so happens that Megan has been there all along. As we see the abductor pull a lid off a blue barrel that contains Megan's decomposing corpse. This scene itself is worth watching what is mostly a cheesy movie. They did an excellent job with this part of the film. The look of despair on Megan's face is perfect. The hopelessness in her captured in her eyes and facial expression in her last moments of life. You think about a girl that was once so boisterous, so lively, and so aggressive,and there you see her as a lifeless decomposing corpse with the expression of despair frozen into her face. But then, the movie just drops the ball on this and turns it into another cheesy shock factor. ""Megan!!! Megan!!! noooooo!!! *insert cheesy crying*"". This was a perfect moment for the director to have shown the psychological deterioration that Amy would have went through at that point. A complete mental breakdown would have been realistic especially after the abductor threw her into the same container with this rotting corpse. Instead it just becomes a series of ""Nooo! nooo! please let me goes"" and it's as if Megan just vanished again. Amy had a better reaction to seeing her teddy bear again than seeing her dead friend and never the less being thrown and sealed into a barrel with her.At that point the movie flashes forward to the abductor digging a hole to bury Amy and Megan with Amy begging the abductor to let her go and telling him she loves him and yelling for people to help her. It's hard to not focus on the terrible acting and it doesn't help the impact of the scene as much as it should. This carries on for 10 minutes or so till the abductor kicks the barrel containing her and Megan into the hole and covers it up then walks away. Is the scene shocking? Yes, I guess you can say it is. Does it cross over the impact that it should of had? Not really. At this point Amy is only doing what she has since we first see her abducted and that's begging for him to let her go and screaming for help. It doesn't portray the development she should have gone through after being raped and having her virginity taken, being forced to eat food like a dog, chained up in a dark cell, and on top of that seeing her friends rotting corpse and being stuffed in a container along side her. It's as if none of this even registers with Amy and it should. The director/writers never seem to develop the victim realistically. When people are put into these types of situations they break down mentally. That break down is what the impact of the film should have been instead of the horror like shock value. A teen from a good suburban home is kidnapped and forced to go through gruesome/violent acts that turns her into someone that was far from what she started out as. That is more realistic and closer to what actual survivors of these types of situations endure if they are able to be saved. They are never the same again.Now the thing about ""Amy is Missing"" that I think is somewhat of a deception is that the movie emphasizes on the dangers of meeting a stranger online and ""this could be you"". When that's far from the reality. This could be anyone. You don't have to meet someone online to end up in this situation. You can be abducted walking home from school, walking to your car, right in your own home, etc. etc. The type of people that do these things are predators that know how to get away (which is usually why they're rarely caught until they become over confident and make a mistake). When these predators abduct women they go after girls that people won't be searching high and low looking for like prostitutes,homeless girls,runaways,women that are minorities etc. etc.. Which cases have shown tend to be the usual victims for acts like this. When Girls like Megan go missing in most cases it's done by someone they know or someone local that's been stalking them. This film gives the abductor a blank face and a blank motive. Whether it's done on purpose so that the viewer focuses on Megan and Amy or because they just don't know how to develop characters. It just makes the movie feel like a PSA announcement for middle class Caucasian females about befriending people online and a boogie man abducting you.The film itself its pretty over the top. Aside form the ""barrel scene"" the entire abduction is pretty generic. There's Amy's rape scene which I didn't bother to talk about because it was another ""shock value"" moment. It wasn't as impacting as it should have been because it feels like it's forced on you. It goes back to the character development and mental state of Amy when she is captive. The movie never establishes what she's thinking or her desperation. So when you see her raped it's just watching someone over dramatically being raped. ""The Girl Next Door"" had a much more meaningful rape scene as by that point Meg had given up hope completely and wasn't fighting back anymore. You had a clearer picture of what she had been through, what she had endured and what her current state of mind was. In ""Megan is missing"" this scene was were the director should have established Amy's submissiveness and acceptance into her situation as her abductors captive and at his mercy. Instead it bounces from that scene to hopeful Amy again.Overall this movie that was to have been based on real life accounts felt completely unrealistic by the characters actions. The director should have spent more time studying real victims and predators and the psychology behind it and then writing his movie around that idea, instead of making his movie about a few incidents. In a way this movie is not as serious as it should be as it comes off more cheesy than serious and in some scenes the laughable in regards to the acting. The barrel scene was brilliant however and the truly only notable/memorable part of this film. That actually is very real, and the condition investigators do find these missing girls in. They are sometimes mutilated, decomposed, discarded, half way buried, etc. etc. What was once a beautiful woman/girl is now just a rotting shell. What makes that reality even worse is that these things happen and too often. I do hope that this movie makes some of these teen girls more aware of their actions and the decisions they chose to make. It is good that they used two girls for this film. Once that was a party girl and one that was shy and timid. It gives an example that this can happen to any girl not just the party type.With that said I give this movie a 3/5. Very bad acting,decent shock value, but if the message gets across than it was worth it.

1419543,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B004LXBKEC,Micheal Hunt,"[2, 4]","This is one of those movies where the claim what is being shown is reenacted footage and events police found after a kidnapping suspected murder investigation. Yes, it's another Blair Witch style movie. Only this one is not about a myth or supernatural being, it's closer to real life this time around. Megan's friend Amy starts talking to a guy online who doesn't have a webcam, but is claiming he is 13 years old or so, they same age these girls are, and of coarse he is chatting them up to meet them. However when Megan goes to meet him, something goes wrong and Megan goes missing, then things follow suit with Amy. Later in the movie they find Amy's video camera that she had been making video diaries on, and it contains footage filmed by their kidnapper.Personally, I didn't find the movie all that disturbing, but I can see why people would and will. It may sound like I have given spoilers to the movie so far, but believe me I haven't. It's when you find out what the kidnappers intentions for the girls are, and then what happens later at the end of the film that will make some people feel a little unnerved, especially parents who do not monitor what their kids are doing online.However, what I will say about this movie, the first half is a complete snore fest. Obnoxious stupid teens being as irritating as possible. They are only 12 to 14 years old and attending parties full of sex, drugs and god awful trance music. The kid who is hosting this party is a character you just want to grab by the neck and smack him around for a while to burst the ugly little mogwais ego, or turn HIM over to the kidnapper himself. These scenes I guess where put in to show that these kids where able to go and do what they wanted, but I don't think any of it was needed for the movie itself. Do yourself a favor, and skip it. It's just pointless dribble to show Amy is younger, not as popular and gets sick at parties, shes a goodie-two-shoes... trust me, you wont miss a thing.

1419549,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B004LXBKEC,The Piper at the Gates,"[8, 17]","After glancing over some of the other reviews of this film, I have to ask myself this question: Was I watching the same film as a lot of these other people? Several reviews mention words and phrases like ""graphic"", ""realistic"", and ""very disturbing"". Perhaps me being a horror fanatic and that I have seen so many horror films, that I've become a bit desensitized. Perhaps its because I have no children of my own that I don't see the true horror for maybe someone that may be a parent and then viewing this film. But whatever the case, those phrases don't really to come to my mind at all after watching this film. First off, the attempt to do a movie using ""web cam"" and camcorder footage for a more realistic movie viewing experience, is getting a bit tired. Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity 1 and 2, Quarantine are some that come right to mind. Not saying those are all bad movies, in fact I like all those films for the most part, but at some point it just gets a bit old. Perhaps the right concept is there. A cautionary tale for today's youth about using the internet for talking to and meeting strangers, etc. But it wasn't done quite effectively. First off, the acting was sub par. Their line delivery is like watching people reading off lines of dialogue (Except for Amy's character in the last 20 minutes, which was quite good). Besides that however, the Megan character is for the most part unappealing in the fact that she is pretty much a dope head wannabe slut that treats most people badly or just uses them (with the exception of Amy). For me, its hard to feel much empathy for a character that's portrayed in that way. Other problems I had were the ""cell phone cameras"" or whatever they were. How were we actually seeing the characters on their cell phones when they were talking to each other? They used the same ""web cam"" effect on the cell phones too? That made no sense to me. Another thing was the ""breaking news reports"" that were shown. They were laughable. Its like the movie was making fun of itself. At that point I couldn't take the movie seriously. The only redeeming quality this film has was the last 20 minutes or so, when you are taken into a dungeon of sorts while the killer is using Amy's camcorder to document his acts. Yeah, the implied rape scene was a bit bothersome I suppose. As well as the revealed fate of Megan. But still yet, the makers of this film managed to mess this up too, with an extra boring and unnecessary extended digging scene that seems to go on forever! The movie itself is just under 90 minutes, so maybe they were just trying to fill up some screen time. But that scene just ruined what little momentum the film had in the last 20 minutes. Overall, the film isn't the worst I've seen, and again, perhaps the concept is there, but it was done fairly poorly. Again, all these reviews calling this movie so graphic and disturbing are, in my opinion, overreacting. I've seen far far more graphic films than this. People have said this is a film that girls or teens should watch to show what could happen. And I suppose if a 13-16 year old that hasn't seen many scary movies were to watch this, it might shake them up a bit. But as for me, I would be more upset at my parents for making me waste almost 90 minutes of my life while I could have been doing something else..perhaps chatting to a new ""friend"" I met online.;)",2,2.25 Stars: Megan is Missing...but who cares?,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,3387,"['glancing', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'have', 'ask', 'question', 'Was', 'watching', 'same', 'film', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'Several', 'reviews', 'mention', 'words', 'phrases', 'graphic', 'realistic', 'very', 'disturbing', 'Perhaps', 'being', 'horror', 'fanatic', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'become', 'bit', 'desensitized', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'children', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'true', 'horror', 'maybe', 'someone', 'may', 'be', 'parent', 'then', 'viewing', 'film', 'whatever', 'case', 'phrases', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'mind', 'watching', 'film', 'First', 'attempt', 'do', 'movie', 'using', 'web', 'cam', 'camcorder', 'footage', 'more', 'realistic', 'movie', 'viewing', 'experience', 'getting', 'bit', 'tired', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '1', '2', 'Quarantine', 'are', 'come', 'right', 'mind', 'Not', 'saying', 'are', 'bad', 'movies', 'fact', 'films', 'most', 'part', 'point', 'just', 'bit', 'old', 'Perhaps', 'right', 'concept', 'there', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'today', 'youth', 'using', 'internet', 'talking', 'meeting', 'strangers', 'etc', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'quite', 'effectively', 'First', 'acting', 'was', 'sub', 'par', 'line', 'delivery', 'watching', 'people', 'reading', 'off', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'Amy', 'character', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'however', 'Megan', 'character', 'most', 'part', 'unappealing', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'dope', 'head', 'wannabe', 'slut', 'most', 'people', 'badly', 'just', 'exception', 'Amy', 'hard', 'feel', 'much', 'empathy', 'character', 'portrayed', 'way', 'Other', 'problems', 'had', 'were', 'cell', 'phone', 'cameras', 'were', 'How', 'were', 'actually', 'seeing', 'characters', 'cell', 'phones', 'when', 'were', 'talking', 'other', 'used', 'same', 'web', 'cam', 'effect', 'cell', 'phones', 'too', 'made', 'sense', 'thing', 'was', 'breaking', 'news', 'reports', 'were', 'shown', 'were', 'laughable', 'movie', 'was', 'making', 'fun', 'point', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'movie', 'seriously', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'film', 'was', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'when', 'are', 'taken', 'dungeon', 'sorts', 'killer', 'using', 'Amy', 'camcorder', 'document', 'acts', 'Yeah', 'implied', 'rape', 'scene', 'was', 'bit', 'bothersome', 'suppose', 'As', 'well', 'revealed', 'fate', 'Megan', 'still', 'yet', 'makers', 'film', 'managed', 'mess', 'up', 'too', 'extra', 'boring', 'unnecessary', 'extended', 'digging', 'scene', 'go', 'forever', 'movie', 'just', '90', 'minutes', 'so', 'maybe', 'were', 'just', 'trying', 'fill', 'up', 'screen', 'time', 'scene', 'just', 'ruined', 'what', 'little', 'momentum', 'film', 'had', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'Overall', 'film', ""n't"", 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'again', 'perhaps', 'concept', 'there', 'was', 'done', 'fairly', 'poorly', 'Again', 'reviews', 'calling', 'movie', 'so', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'are', 'opinion', 'overreacting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'far', 'more', 'graphic', 'films', 'People', 'have', 'said', 'film', 'teens', 'should', 'watch', 'show', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'suppose', '13-16', 'year', 'old', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'scary', 'movies', 'were', 'watch', 'might', 'shake', 'up', 'bit', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'upset', 'parents', 'making', 'waste', 'almost', '90', 'minutes', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'something', 'else..perhaps', 'chatting', 'new', 'friend', 'met', 'online']",Megan Is Missing

1419551,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,B004LXBKEC,Tristan,"[8, 11]","I've watched this film MEGAN IS MISSING a few times now, and each time I watch it I feel that it gets stronger and stronger. The first time I watched it was about a year ago with my partner. I found it to be effective in it's own way, but was so frustrated by it that I couldn't bring myself to really like it or even recommend it. I did vow that I would never watch it again, however, because even for someone like me who has seen a lot of transgressive pictures with truly disturbing subject matter (IRREVERSIBLE, COME AND SEE, THREADS, A SERBIAN FILM, THE COOK THE THIEF HIS WIFE & HER LOVER, LIE, RED WHITE & BLUE, IN A GLASS CAGE, DANCER IN THE DARK, and BAD BOY BUBBY are some of my favorite films), some of the ideas presented here angered me significantly. MEGAN IS MISSING is not a graphic film by any means. It's content isn't even as explicit as something you'd see in most slasher films. The only difference is in it's realism and in the fact that you care about the characters. However, months after first watching it, my partner and I still couldn't stop talking about it. This is honestly quite a film. It's a very fearless and intense effort that hits very close to home for a lot of people. I had to buy the DVD because I figured any film that can get two hardened film buffs talking for so long has to be taken seriously and deserves to be explored. So I bought the DVD, watched the film (with and without the audio commentaries) and all the special features, and then I watched it again. This isn't something new for me. I do this with pretty much every film I purchase. The experience of watching MEGAN IS MISSING, however, is not unlike the experience of watching KIDS. The experience is a depressing, horrible, sickening, slightly exaggerated, but extremely important one that is most definitely not for everyone but still needs to be seen by some folks. This is a film that is worth discussing, flaws and all.Now I'm not going to pretend that this film doesn't have problems. It does. The whole presentation, in a realism sense, doesn't quite hold water. The characters chat on their cellphones via video, which I can believe. What I can't quite believe is the idea that these video logs can be captured with utmost clarity like they are presented here. Also there is a brief scene at the end that details a camera of one of the girls being found in a garbage can in a nearby park, something I don't believe a sexually sadistic man would do if he wanted his acts to be seen. A park bench? That would have made more sense. A garbage can? No way. I don't disbelieve that a mad man wouldn't do that if he were out of his head, but in the context and flow of this film it comes across as somewhat jarring and out-of-place to me, personally. Those two flaws do bring the realism of the film down a little bit, but it doesn't actually take away from the atmosphere or the tone of the film in any way, and that's the part of the film that I truly admire.One of the most impressive aspects of the film, to me, was the way the schizophrenia of the predator in question was depicted and explored. That's a very real concept of a sexual predator. A sexual predator is someone who often feels like an outcast in society, a man who is looking from the outside in, someone who feels like they were rejected and torched by societal standards. Take a look at the film Monster starring Charlize Theron, or better yet, Man Bites Dog, a film that is brilliant in too many ways to even describe in this review. I do feel that more and more filmmakers are really getting to understand the minds of people who like to hurt people, and I also feel that film is one of the best ways to explore the minds of the diseased and the perverted. Here with MEGAN IS MISSING we have a sexually sadistic human being whose impulse is to paint and portray himself as someone that these girls would actively desire and appreciate. He plays the role of a guy who acts tough, but he also shows a nervous and weak side to him that these girls understand and sympathize with. To me, the choice of making this mad man use that as his way of luring this one particular girl in actually has a pretty startling effect. Now, I'm not going to say that the exploration of this particular psychopath's mind is as deep, as affecting, or as intense as in films such as PSYCHO, HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, the original 1988 Dutch version of THE VANISHING, FREEWAY, or even the unrelated sequel to FREEWAY, but considering that this is meant to be a found-footage picture, Michael Goi's script does a pretty damn good job at analyzing this mad man and really getting the audience into his head. You can tell that this world of psychopaths and sexual, internet and otherwise, predators is one that Michael Goi has done a lot of research with and has spent a lot of time exploring. It's actually pretty horrific in a way to see how realistically and true-to-life the scenarios in this film are presented, and therefore I'd say this would be a good film for students of psychology and sociopathic mental disorders to really pay attention to and discuss. Like I said, this film, at times, really puts you in the head of a psychopath. The effect is quite the mind screw.The film never truly exploits it's subjects, even when it feels like it is, similarly to what Larry Clark did with KIDS. With KIDS, Larry Clark presented to us the world of these young teens and lured us into thinking that we are going to see something really exciting and edgy and dangerous, and instead revealed to us a rather digustingly sweaty world of underdeveloped kids with bad hygiene, disgusting habits, and destructive behavior. This film lays all of that out quite early on, so we get past that fairly quickly and allow ourselves to pay more attention to what is ultimately at the heart of everything. The two lead actresses, Rachel Quinn and Amber Perkins, both give incredible performances. Quinn plays the title role of Megan as damaged, destructive, and sassy and hits every vulnerable and fearful note spot on. She is very much like a lot of girls that I went to high school with, and her role here makes perfect sense in the grand scheme of the picture as sexual predators tend to go after people who are vulnerable and damaged. They also tend to go after unpopular outcasts as well, which is where the character of Amy comes in. She is pretty much pure innocence. She is intelligent, pretty, and is widely and actively shunned by Megan's friends. Amber Perkins gives the strongest performance as Amy. She totally comes across as the kind of girl I would have been friends with in middle school. Lonely, funny, and very young at heart. I can guess that perhaps part of why she is so shunned is because she comes from money. Some camera sequences depict her stable home life with a large house and a collection of very cute toys and stuffed animals. She's a wonderful character and she's what really brought the film together in my opinion. The second half of the film explores her character while the first half of the film explores Megan's character more, similarly to Lukas Moodysson's hauntingly entertaining picture SHOW ME LOVE. Also, on a side note, (and I totally don't mean this in any bad or offensive way because, like I said, I truly love her work here) I could totally picture Amber Perkins being an amazing final girl in a slasher film. Her scream is one of the best screams I've heard in a film in some time.So now I suppose I am to talk about the final 25 minutes of the film that is supposedly so controversial. Well, I gotta say that I'd be lying if I said that I did cry pretty hard at what I was watching. I'm a sensitive person, and the idea of someone sexually abusing young teens and children is an admittedly difficult idea for me to even comprehend to this day, despite the fact that I'm pretty knowledgeable when it comes to how psychopaths like the one in this film think. What happens to Amy in the final act of this film, and what is implied about Megan shortly before and during the final act, is truly morbid. However, I cannot say that I was personally disturbed by it. Depressed? Yes. Shocked? I suppose. Surprised? Most definitely. However, disturbed? Not in the least. I've read far too much about, so-called, ""evil"" people in this world for the nightmarish territory that gets explored at the end to really disturb me. You want disturbing? Read the news. Read about the war. Read about what's happening in third-world countries. Read about other missing persons cases. The thing that many folks may realize but probably can't fully accept is that the case depicted in this film is a pretty mild kidnapping case in comparison to the millions and millions of atrocities committed by other sexually sadistic child abusers who have kidnapped children and teens, sometimes from their own homes, in order to systematically torture, rape, mutilate, and kill little girls and little boys who can't even comprehend the idea that someone like this could even exist in the same world as them and would want to do such horrible and inhumane things to their poor little bodies. Hell, Mark Klass, the guy who SPONSORED THE DVD of MEGAN IS MISSING had a daughter who I'd say met a far more grotesque fate than the girls in this film, when you consider the age of the girl who was kidnapped, the circumstances surrounding the kidnapping, the details of the predator, and the time it took for him to actually murder her. I've read stories about sexual predators who have raped girls and boys for days and days on end before dumping their bodies in acid, something that many folks, honestly, probably can't even comprehend the idea of a person being cruel enough to do. I'm sorry if I seem at all insensitive, but this is an issue that I truly feel very passionate about and that's probably why I'm so fascinated by this film, because Goi seems equally as passionate about it as me, if not more. This is an angry film, and that's one thing that I especially learned from listening to the commentary on the DVD. Goi knows a lot about how these people lure children in and he obviously put a lot of heart, soul, and backbone into making sure that the experience of watching this is as frustrating for us to watch as it is for him to even think about. I recommend that folks out there listen to the commentary track recorded by Amber Perkins and Rachel Quinn, because it actually is quite revealing for them to talk about what is, obviously, difficult adult material to act, for young actresses in particular. Both of them are exceptionally down to earth and are able to safely admit that being in a film like this can be a very scary and uncomfortable experience. If you found the infamous photos that appear in this film to be disgusting and horrible, try putting yourself in the role of the actress that had to ""pose"" for those photos. She has a harder time looking at those pictures than any audience member ever will. As for Perkins, her thoughts and feelings on the entire final twenty two minutes are fully of insight and honesty that I don't think even a lot of really seasoned actors and actresses could really comfortably share. The commentary tracks on this DVD are pretty great and make the DVD actually worth buying for those who at least need some kind of closure that the two lead girls are okay, similarly to the DVD of AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON with the commentary track by the two male leads. The tracks almost function as an extension of the characters themselves.Overall, MEGAN IS MISSING is not going to be a film for everyone, even for those who love disturbing and shocking films. This film, clearly, doesn't aim to simply shock and disturb. Instead, Michael Goi highlights many issues about sexual predators that many folks (not even Hollywood) don't want to truly acknowledge, and he does a very fine job given the budget and how few days it took to shoot the film. Don't get me wrong, and think that I'm one of those people who feel that children should see this film. I am NOT one of those people. History has shown that scare tactics never work, and it drives me nuts when folks like to claim that films like this and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM need to be shown in schools. I'm also not one of those people who think that sexual predators and serial killers should all be murdered. I'm very much against the death penalty, and I think killing someone who has tortured, molested, or killed innocent children prevents us from learning from them and learning about why they felt so deeply compelled to so something so awful. Killing someone doesn't make the problem go away. It never does. Murder is one of the least productive acts that any human being can ever commit, and I'm sickened and angered that folks still don't realize that. Not to get on my soapbox or anything, but look at a recent example. We killed Bin Laden. Who's to say that another psychopath won't take his place tomorrow? There will be. There always will be. Violence never solves anything. One of my biggest goals in life is to raise kids one day, and I'm not going to stop them from going on the internet just because I've seen disturbing films like this, HARD CANDY (which was flawed, but, admittedly, very brave when it came to actually showing sympathy for a sexual predator), and TRUST (which, by the way, is another very excellent film that I think takes just as many chances as this film does). Instead I'm going to educate my children about the dangers of the internet, as well as the positive elements. It's really not that hard to educate children, it just helps if you are brave and upfront with them about it, because, trust me, they are always smarter than you think they are.",3,A film that is both

Toddmancillas,"[1, 2]","If you have the stomach for it, this is, to say the least, an extremely disturbing and what appears to be realistic portrayal of online predation.  I find it a bit difficult to believe that these young girls (13,14) could be so gullible, but obviously many young girls are, as borne out by the fact that online predation is a very real, horrid phenomenon.Aside from the villain's somewhat over-the-top lines, the dialogue is compellingly realistic, the settings and photography are spot on, and the editing is perfect.  One of the other reviewers commented that the closing fifteen minutes are gratuitously disturbing and creepy.  That may be so, but overall, this film is hauntingly fascinating and might well discourage young people from establishing blindly trusting online relationships.  However, it also may be so over the top that young people dismiss this story as overly dramatic interpretation; therefore, unlikely to resonate with their day-to-day experiences.This film brings to mind &#34;Compliance,&#34; which is another horrid reenactment of twisted sexual abuse visited upon young female fast food employees with--incredibly--the unwitting collaboration of supervisors.
