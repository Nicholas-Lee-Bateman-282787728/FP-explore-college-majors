The family definitely came off in the beginning of the movie as typical big city liberal-leaning family that has lost everything and is waiting for the government or an NGO to save them.  Later in the movie the father turns out to be an experienced woodsman, born in the backwoods.  But he didn't own a firearm?

THE COLLAPSED is a fitting description for Justin McConnell's post-apocalyptic plot that suffers from a confusing lack of identity. It is never certain until the end whether the film is trying to be a zombie movie or a creature feature, or if it is instead just a straight survival horror film in a world turned mad. It makes all of the same missteps as the 2010 remake of THE CRAZIES, pairing an uneventful plot and unintriguing characters together without even providing any gratuitous gore to maintain a feigning interest along the way. John Fantasia does his best as the family's forceful leader, but most of the performances feel like they are just being read to us. Even the visual metaphors are entirely transparent.

1531509,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B007IUEDYY,C. Sawin,"[3, 4]","""The Collapsed"" is exactly what you expect from a low budget horror film; it's pretty dreadful most of the time, but is also somewhat impressive at times especially considering with how little they had to work with. The cast is underwhelming. Most of the acting from the entire cast is very stiff. Nothing really feels like it flows naturally and feels forced more often than not. John Fantasia is okay for a while, but loses what little credit he has in the last ten to fifteen minutes of the movie where he seems to channel the overacting ability of Nicolas Cage. Nobody knows how to cry properly either as not one of them sheds a single, solitary tear amongst the four of them.Much of the movie is characters hearing hushed voices all around them and feeling a presence that always seems to be there but can never be seen. So more often than not you're watching somebody whip around pointing a gun at tree bark over and over again as somebody else asks them a similar barrage of questions somebody would on ""Lassie;"" ""What is it, girl? Do you hear something? Is somebody in trouble?"" It does eventually pay off in the end, but it's highly likely that many will turn it off before it gets to that point.The screenplay gets the job done, but isn't great. The Rebecca character seems purposely written to be annoying. She's incredibly petty, is on the verge of a hissy fit because the world has ended and has taken her boyfriend in the process, and says really stupid things most of the time. Her dad tells her to get some sleep, which she replies, ""You don't have to tell me twice,"" which would've made since if her mother hadn't said the exact same thing less than five minutes before. But then once she shaves her legs, she becomes little miss ""let's keep the family together."" Scott's ""I saw what I saw!"" bit at the end didn't really help matters either. It just seems like a silly and obvious thing to exclaim when you're in danger.The best part about ""The Collapsed"" is the score; classical at times, bluesy at others, and all out jazz in between. There are some serious horns used at times and a fair share of strings. It's pretty great. Unfortunately, it seems extremely out of place the rest of the time. Sneaking around the woods with blazing horns triumphantly highlighting your journey seems kind of awkward, doesn't it?The moment that stands out the most is when Scott and Aaron have this one-on-one conversation in a house they break into where they have their first hot meal in weeks. Their dialogue, body language, and performances are just much more genuine than everything else in the movie.""The Collapsed"" certainly isn't the worst movie you could watch. In fact, it's watchable just not great. The gory ending tries to make up for every shortcoming the movie has in the rest of its 82 minute duration. It's like it grazes the surface of what the ending was like to the original ""Saw."" It isn't nearly as big of a twist and it doesn't have nearly as much of an impact, but the similarities are certainly there.The movie does feel pretty silly at times and if the rigid acting doesn't get to you the lame dialogue just might. In the end though, if you power through every urge to turn the movie off and give ""The Collapsed"" an actual chance, it's a somehwat effective low budget horror movie that isn't quite as bad as some are making it out to be. It feels kind of like an even cheaper version of ""The Divide,"" also released by Anchor Bay, but ""The Divide"" is definitely the better of the two.The single disc DVD is loaded with special features including Audio Commentary with Writer/Producer/Director Justin McConnell and Co-Producer Kevin Hutchinson, Audio Commentary with Actor John Fantasia, Music Video: Rob Kleiner's ""Devil in Disguise,"" Weblink (QR Code) to unlock the 71-minute ""Apocalypse On A Budget"" Making of Documentary, Trailers, Photo Gallery, and Cast and Crew Bios.

1531510,AYG1U47VFZ165,B007IUEDYY,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 3]","I'm willing to give THE COLLAPSED a few points for actually having a story and doing something.  There's a discernable beginning, middle, and end here - though you may not like them - and, while it's no triumph, it tries to do something novel by incorporating an M. Night Shyamalan twist into this B-movie nightmare.Society has collapsed, and a single family hopes to travel safely from the big city to the rural town of their past.  The Apocalypse is no friend to anyone, and, before it's all over, the family will be torn apart by secrets and an unseen virus that threatens every survivor.Well, I love a good Apocalypse tale as much as the next guy, so I went into THE COLLAPSED with some interest.  The problem was that the interest wasn't entirely sustainable.  For all its merits, the film is little more than a `gotcha' picture - once you know the end, you encourage everything that's come before.  That isn't a bad thing.  In order to be successful, the weight of all the pieces - the acting, the cinematography, the sound, etc. - has to be fairly evenly balanced in order for the audience to buy into this mystery with more than a willing suspension of disbelief, and that's where THE COLLAPSED fails.  There's not a credible performance here, unless you like wood; there's no enough of a central plotline to make any of it relatable (like the best Apocalypse stories have); and there's far too much time spent walking through pretty forests for anything short of a Mutual of Omaha retrospective.Also, the film worked way too hard to ratchet up tension musically.  The score by Rob Kleiner tries to map out over scare (or anticipated score) almost to the point of parody.  Tip: sometimes a `thump in the night' is just a `thump in the night,' so let your audience experience them without obviously telegraphing it.  Treat the viewer as if he's smart enough to know what's scary and what's not, and he's likely to thank you for it.  Stories like this are best told when the central mystery is allowed to simmer, but, sadly, the musical beats here really relegated any independent thought to the backburner.To his credit, writer/director/producer Justin McConnell is responsible for an awful lot here - one could easily make the argument that maybe he stretched himself a bit too thin - and therein lies the problem I had with so much of THE COLLAPSED: for what it delivered, it's way too much.  Unlike Shyamalan's films, these characters have no depth and very little history.  There are a few hints; and, very late in the picture, McConnell tries to flesh out a father/son tension between survivors, but it's all too little too late at that point.  What you end up with is a 30-minute short film (a `Twilight Zone' episode) expanded to 82 minutes ... and, by my count, that's 52 minutes more than necessary.  If anything, I could see this effort putting McConnell in the position to do something larger - hopefully with much more funding and better locations - and I wish him well.THE COLLAPSED was produced by Unstable Ground Pictures in association with Raven Banner Entertainment, with some participation by Anchor Bay Entertainment.  The disc comes via Anchor Bay.  The film has won accolades, including serving as an Official Selection for the 2011 Fangoria Film Festival, the 2011 Fright Night Film Festival, and the 2011 Rue Morgue Festival of Fear; as well as winning the 2011 Metropolitan Film Festival of New York and the 2011 Crypticon Film Festival.  It looks and sounds fairly solid, though I did have some minor audio issues with several forest sequences.  The disc is chocked full of features, including two separate audio commentaries, a music video, and photos with cast & crew bios.RECOMMENDED only for fans of independent film who want to see how you can film the Apocalypse on the cheap ... if there is such an audience.  Also, be prepared with the remote to `fast forward' your way through some utterly meaningless long stretches of actors walking through the forest looking nothing but pensive ... you're going to need it.In the interests of fairness, the fine folks at Anchor Bay Entertainment provided me with a DVD screener copy of THE COLLAPSED for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",2,THE COLLAPSED Collapses Under Its Own Weight,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,4232,"[""'m"", 'willing', 'give', 'THE', 'COLLAPSED', 'few', 'points', 'actually', 'having', 'story', 'doing', 'something', 'discernable', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'here', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'triumph', 'do', 'something', 'novel', 'incorporating', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'twist', 'B-movie', 'nightmare.Society', 'collapsed', 'single', 'family', 'travel', 'safely', 'big', 'city', 'rural', 'town', 'past', 'Apocalypse', 'friend', 'anyone', 'over', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'torn', 'apart', 'secrets', 'unseen', 'virus', 'survivor.Well', 'love', 'good', 'Apocalypse', 'tale', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'went', 'THE', 'COLLAPSED', 'interest', 'problem', 'was', 'interest', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'sustainable', 'merits', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'gotcha', 'picture', 'once', 'know', 'end', 'encourage', 'everything', 'come', 'before', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'order', 'be', 'successful', 'weight', 'pieces', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'etc', 'be', 'fairly', 'evenly', 'balanced', 'order', 'audience', 'buy', 'mystery', 'more', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'where', 'THE', 'COLLAPSED', 'not', 'credible', 'performance', 'here', 'wood', 'enough', 'central', 'plotline', 'make', 'relatable', 'best', 'Apocalypse', 'stories', 'have', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'walking', 'pretty', 'forests', 'anything', 'short', 'Mutual', 'Omaha', 'retrospective.Also', 'film', 'worked', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'ratchet', 'up', 'tension', 'musically', 'score', 'Rob', 'Kleiner', 'map', 'out', 'scare', 'anticipated', 'score', 'almost', 'point', 'parody', 'Tip', 'sometimes', 'thump', 'night', 'just', 'thump', 'night', 'so', 'let', 'audience', 'experience', 'obviously', 'telegraphing', 'Treat', 'viewer', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'what', 'scary', 'what', 'not', 'likely', 'thank', 'Stories', 'are', 'best', 'told', 'when', 'central', 'mystery', 'allowed', 'simmer', 'sadly', 'musical', 'beats', 'here', 'really', 'relegated', 'independent', 'thought', 'backburner.To', 'credit', 'writer/director/producer', 'Justin', 'McConnell', 'responsible', 'awful', 'lot', 'here', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'make', 'argument', 'maybe', 'stretched', 'bit', 'too', 'thin', 'therein', 'problem', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'THE', 'COLLAPSED', 'what', 'delivered', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Shyamalan', 'films', 'characters', 'have', 'depth', 'very', 'little', 'history', 'are', 'few', 'hints', 'very', 'late', 'picture', 'McConnell', 'flesh', 'out', 'father/son', 'tension', 'survivors', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'point', 'What', 'end', 'up', '30-minute', 'short', 'film', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'expanded', '82', 'minutes', 'count', '52', 'minutes', 'more', 'necessary', 'anything', 'could', 'see', 'effort', 'putting', 'McConnell', 'position', 'do', 'something', 'larger', 'hopefully', 'much', 'more', 'funding', 'better', 'locations', 'wish', 'well.THE', 'COLLAPSED', 'was', 'produced', 'Unstable', 'Ground', 'Pictures', 'association', 'Raven', 'Banner', 'Entertainment', 'participation', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'disc', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'film', 'won', 'accolades', 'including', 'serving', 'Official', 'Selection', '2011', 'Fangoria', 'Film', 'Festival', '2011', 'Fright', 'Night', 'Film', 'Festival', '2011', 'Rue', 'Morgue', 'Festival', 'Fear', 'as', 'well', 'winning', '2011', 'Metropolitan', 'Film', 'Festival', 'New', 'York', '2011', 'Crypticon', 'Film', 'Festival', 'fairly', 'solid', 'did', 'have', 'minor', 'audio', 'issues', 'several', 'forest', 'sequences', 'disc', 'chocked', 'full', 'features', 'including', 'two', 'separate', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'music', 'video', 'photos', 'cast', 'crew', 'only', 'fans', 'independent', 'film', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'can', 'film', 'Apocalypse', 'cheap', 'such', 'audience', 'Also', 'be', 'prepared', 'remote', 'fast', 'forward', 'way', 'utterly', 'meaningless', 'long', 'stretches', 'actors', 'walking', 'forest', 'looking', 'nothing', 'pensive', ""'re"", 'going', 'need', 'it.In', 'interests', 'fairness', 'fine', 'folks', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'provided', 'DVD', 'screener', 'copy', 'THE', 'COLLAPSED', 'expressed', 'purposes', 'completing', 'review']","Collapsed, The us Version"

1531513,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B007IUEDYY,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[8, 10]","""The Collapsed"" is an apocalypic thriller about one family's battle to stay alive on a trek through a landscape of barbarism and cannibalism.  In the wake of an unspecified event that has catapulted civilization into a fatal downward spiral, the Weaver family -- father Scott (John Fantasia), young adult son Aaron (Steve Vieira), mother Emily (Lise Moule), and teenage daughter Rebecca (Anna Ross) -- desperately tries to survive.  Fleeing the city, the family hopes to find sanctuary in a rural hometown from their past, Dover's Bend.With the constant threat of violent death forcing them to stay as far from other people as possible, they take to the forest.  However, they soon discover that the danger posed by other survivors may be the least of their worries.  Someone -- or something -- seems to have followed them into the wilderness.Though the premise sounds like that of cable TV's ""The Walking Dead,"" ""The Collapsed"" preceded the AMC miniseries.  Director Justin McConnell knows how to put together a horror film; he's excellent at creating and building suspense and incorporating plenty of shock moments along the way.  He also spends time letting us get to know the Weavers as individuals so that we feel a stake in what happens to them.End-of-the-world movies have proliferated lately, but ""The Collapsed"" stands out.

1531514,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B007IUEDYY,Tim Janson,"[1, 2]","The Collapsed is one weird film and not really in a good way.  After some unexplained apocalyptic event, a family of four struggles to survive and find safe shelter while being stalked by some unforeseen malevolent force.  This is a very low budget film featuring a small, tight cast that is far too short on action and far too heavy on amateurish acting to hold your attention.  Scott Weaver, wife Emily, teenaged daughter Rebecca, and 20's son Aaron are the family in question who are on the move looking for secure shelter, and trying to avoid road bandits who will take whatever they want.  The first 15 minutes of the film starts out fairly strong as they abandoned their shelter in a garage and secure a car.  They are trying to make it to their other son who is presumably away at college.However when they stop to scavenge for supplies at a gas station, they are forced to flee into the woods from a pair of armed men.  Unfortunately the film breaks down from here as it moves at a plodding pace amplified by innate dialog.  As the family stops to rest, Rebecca uses the respite to walk off in the woods by herself, despite all of the danger around them...to shave her legs by a stream.  Nothing like having your priorities in order.  Despite the fact that survivors of whatever disaster took place seem few and far between, the dad is determined to stay off the road and walk for over 7 days in the woods to get to their destination...despite the fact that they have little in the way of supplies.The one thing that Director/Screenwriter Justin Mcconnell has going for him is that he does manage to build a bit of suspense and creepiness.  The family feels the presence of some unseen, evil force stalking them constantly and it's the one thing that holds your interest as you want to know how it fits into the story.  But in the end Mcconnell fumbles this by falling back on a plot contrivance that has become far too overused in horror films recently.  And the fact that we never get an explanation as to what exactly happened in the world makes The Collapsed an extremely hollow film.",2,"Creepy, weird, and stupid",1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,2096,"['Collapsed', 'one', 'weird', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'way', 'unexplained', 'apocalyptic', 'event', 'family', 'four', 'struggles', 'survive', 'find', 'safe', 'shelter', 'being', 'stalked', 'unforeseen', 'malevolent', 'force', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'featuring', 'small', 'tight', 'cast', 'far', 'too', 'short', 'action', 'far', 'too', 'heavy', 'amateurish', 'acting', 'hold', 'attention', 'Scott', 'Weaver', 'wife', 'Emily', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'Rebecca', '20', 'son', 'Aaron', 'are', 'family', 'question', 'who', 'are', 'move', 'looking', 'secure', 'shelter', 'trying', 'avoid', 'road', 'bandits', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'want', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'out', 'fairly', 'strong', 'abandoned', 'shelter', 'garage', 'secure', 'car', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'other', 'son', 'who', 'presumably', 'away', 'college.However', 'when', 'stop', 'scavenge', 'supplies', 'gas', 'station', 'are', 'forced', 'flee', 'woods', 'pair', 'armed', 'men', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'breaks', 'down', 'here', 'plodding', 'pace', 'amplified', 'innate', 'dialog', 'family', 'rest', 'Rebecca', 'respite', 'walk', 'off', 'woods', 'danger', 'shave', 'legs', 'stream', 'Nothing', 'having', 'priorities', 'order', 'fact', 'survivors', 'disaster', 'took', 'place', 'seem', 'few', 'far', 'dad', 'determined', 'stay', 'road', 'walk', '7', 'days', 'woods', 'get', 'destination', 'fact', 'have', 'little', 'way', 'supplies.The', 'one', 'thing', 'Director/Screenwriter', 'Justin', 'Mcconnell', 'going', 'manage', 'build', 'bit', 'suspense', 'creepiness', 'family', 'presence', 'unseen', 'evil', 'force', 'stalking', 'constantly', 'one', 'thing', 'interest', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'story', 'end', 'Mcconnell', 'falling', 'back', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'become', 'far', 'too', 'overused', 'horror', 'films', 'recently', 'fact', 'never', 'get', 'explanation', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'world', 'Collapsed', 'extremely', 'hollow', 'film']","Collapsed, The us Version"
1531515,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B007IUEDYY,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","This is an American independent, end of the world, psychological type horror. It is based around a family of four, they are in the big city and an `event' has happened that seems to make everyone uber violent. They know their only hope is to get away and head out of town to find the other son. The father Scott Weaver (John Fantasia) leads his wife, daughter and son away from the pestilent city and head off in a stolen car to the comparative safety of the country-side.But you know they are going to encounter other `humans' at some point and things are never going to go well. This features lots of camera angles with weird breathing which is there to evoke fear in the viewer and to make us think that bad things are going to happen. Whilst the father does have graphic night mares in the build up to `the twist', it is unlikely that the on screen antics will have the same effect on you.The acting is not Academy nominee grade, but there are some convincing performances. We have the usual stupid decisions that happen in all films of this genre, the sort that nearly always lead to a demise of the miscreant or increased tension. This does work in part, and the family become more begrimed as they get further away from civilisation, which is a nice nod to realism.Overall though this is not that entertaining, it drags in the middle and the action is sporadic at best, the saving grace is the kick in the tail and that was actually the only thing that pulled this back from a lower rating than I have awarded. If you like all things `horror', then this will never be on your `A' list, but you still may want to see, if you only want a quality fright-fest, then best to not bother.",3,Not that Scary `End of the World' story,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,1688,"['American', 'independent', 'end', 'world', 'psychological', 'type', 'horror', 'based', 'family', 'four', 'are', 'big', 'city', 'event', 'happened', 'make', 'everyone', 'uber', 'violent', 'know', 'only', 'hope', 'get', 'away', 'head', 'town', 'find', 'other', 'son', 'father', 'Scott', 'Weaver', 'John', 'Fantasia', 'wife', 'daughter', 'son', 'away', 'pestilent', 'city', 'head', 'off', 'stolen', 'car', 'comparative', 'safety', 'country-side.But', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'encounter', 'other', 'humans', 'point', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'going', 'go', 'well', 'lots', 'camera', 'angles', 'weird', 'breathing', 'there', 'evoke', 'fear', 'viewer', 'make', 'think', 'bad', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'happen', 'Whilst', 'father', 'have', 'graphic', 'night', 'mares', 'build', 'up', 'twist', 'unlikely', 'screen', 'antics', 'will', 'have', 'same', 'effect', 'you.The', 'acting', 'not', 'Academy', 'nominee', 'grade', 'are', 'convincing', 'performances', 'have', 'usual', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'happen', 'films', 'genre', 'sort', 'nearly', 'always', 'lead', 'demise', 'miscreant', 'increased', 'tension', 'work', 'part', 'family', 'become', 'more', 'begrimed', 'get', 'further', 'away', 'civilisation', 'nice', 'nod', 'realism.Overall', 'not', 'entertaining', 'middle', 'action', 'sporadic', 'best', 'saving', 'grace', 'kick', 'tail', 'was', 'actually', 'only', 'thing', 'pulled', 'back', 'lower', 'rating', 'have', 'awarded', 'like', 'things', 'horror', 'then', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'list', 'still', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'only', 'want', 'quality', 'fright-fest', 'then', 'best', 'not', 'bother']","Collapsed, The us Version"
