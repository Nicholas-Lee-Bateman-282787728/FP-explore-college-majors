Smith,"[0, 2]","Supposedly set in 1976, this art house film borrows from movies like ""Diner"" to bring a group of male and female friends together as they hash out issues of young adulthood such as death, birth, money and the meaning of life. There's really precious little that evokes 1976 besides some TV clips of Jimmy Carter and Jerry Ford, and a few Bicentennial references that anyone under 30 won't get. Still, this is a pleasant film with a few mild laughs, almost no violence and some people you will at least not despise after 90 minutes.

Since I know as much about clam digging as I do rocket science I'll give the film's makers the benefit of the doubt.  The film is a wistful elegy on the passing of an era where the independent clam diggers are being replaced by corporate interests.  The diggers salve their wounds by engaging in boozing, brawling, doping, making jokes and making love.  It's at turns funny and poignant.  The ensemble cast is terrific led by Paul Rudd.

1061570,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000NY0YKE,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Capturing a bit of Americana, a parcel of life foreign in nature to our own, has offered the opportunity to appreciate the diversity of living and of people in this country populated by ordinary yet extraordinary beings.  Films  that have focused on little family ventures ('Mystic Pizza'-type films) make us examine our own niche and grow to love variations on a single theme.  DIGGERS, as written by Ken Marino (who also stars), is just such a story, a window on the life of clam diggers in the shores off Long Island.  Yet as directed by Katherine Dieckmann and acted by a particularly fine cast, DIGGERS addresses the changes that occur in each of us as we progress from teenagers to adults - and all the potentially crippling and thrilling factors that can and do arise.Four friends who dig for clams as their families have done for generations interact on levels of levity and anger, support and misunderstanding, and woven through the background of these four men's lives are the women (and children) who influence them.  The apparently disparate men include wannabe photographer Hunt (Paul Rudd), procreator Lozo (Ken Marino), druggie philosopher Cons (Josh Hamilton), and womanizer Jack (Ron Eldard).  Their lives intersect on many levels: the women in their lives - Hunt's needy divorced sister Gina (Maura Tierney) who after their father's death  falls for Jack, Hunt's 'summer girlfriend' Zoey (Lauren Ambrose), and Lozo's constantly pregnant wife Julie (Sarah Paulson) - and the changes in the entire business of clamming rights as big business steps into the water.  How these characters cope with the static that jars their day-to-day existence may seem small in importance to an outsider, but by the end of the film, we 'the outsiders' have grown to know and appreciate and love this little band of fellow beings.The cast displays excellent ensemble acting and while the film has its rough edges, so does the little corner of the world described.  It is a quiet little film, all the more beautiful for being so unpretentious.

1061577,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000NY0YKE,Roland E. Zwick,"[36, 37]","***1/2How refreshing it is to encounter an art house, ""independent"" film that doesn't rely on  ""quirkiness,"" ""eclecticism"" or ""eccentricity"" to impress the viewer with its ""cleverness.""  Instead, ""Diggers"" is a realistic slice-of-life drama that plays it straight with its audience, viewing both its characters and their situations without cynicism or irony.Set in 1976, ""Diggers"" focuses on four young men leading lives of quiet desperation, working as independent clam diggers on Long Island Sound.  All four have pretty much accepted the fate life has handed them, although one, a talented photographer named Hunt (Paul Rudd), dreams vaguely of one day starting a new life away from his family home and business, if only he can muster enough personal courage and initiative to actually make the move.  His married buddy, Lozo (Ken Marino, who also wrote the screenplay), is more firmly tied down to the area by the responsibilities he has as husband and father to an ever-expanding brood of undisciplined children.  The remainder of the quartet consists of Jack (Ron Eldard), a devil-may-care womanizer, who becomes romantically involved with Hunt's thirty-six year old divorced sister, Gina (Maura Tierney); and Cons (Josh Hamilton), a perpetually stoned pseudo-hippie philosopher who, of all the characters, seems most in tune with the drug culture loopiness of the period in which the movie is set.  In addition to Gina, the women in their lives include Lozo's levelheaded but eternally frustrated wife, Julie (Sarah Paulson), and Zoe (Lauren Ambrose from ""Six Feet Under""), a pretty young woman from Manhattan who has a brief summertime flirtation with Hunt.Written by Marino and directed by Katherine Dieckmann, ""Diggers"" is so low-keyed in its attitude and tone that it may feel to some viewers as if nothing much really happens in the film.  Yet, in many ways, this is the major selling-point of the movie - that it doesn't feel obligated to make big dramatic gestures to unravel its characters or maintain our interest.  Marino and Dieckmann have a nice feel for the rhythms of life, as everyday, casual moments are given equal weight with major, life-altering events - the death of a parent, the announcement of a pregnancy, the final farewell to a dearly departed.If there is a flaw in the film, it is that the movie is simply too short (a mere 89 minutes) to allow for the kind of plot expansion and probing character development we rightfully expect from a work of this sort.  In fact, due primarily to the time constraints, two of the buddies, Jack and Cons, are reduced to little more than minor characters in the overall fabric of the story.  An additional half hour or so in the running time would have gone a long way towards correcting that problem.  As compensation, the director exploits to the full the bucolic richness of the unfamiliar setting, and captures the laid-back quality of an era in which the youthful idealism of an earlier time has all but evaporated in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate.  The movie also touches on the threat of creeping globalization as these family-run clam-digging operations are beginning to be squeezed out of business by an impersonal conglomeration that has recently moved into the area.  Through Lozo's character, in particular, the movie effectively dramatizes the stress and strain working-class couples and families go through when they are living literally paycheck to paycheck, along with the compromises they are forced to make just to keep their heads above water.Rudd, who has long been underrated as an actor, provides a beautifully understated performance as the soul-searching Hunt, and he is superbly abetted by the other members of the cast.More anecdote than full-fledged narrative, ""Diggers"" has the benefit of not taking itself or its characters too seriously.  It presents its story in a naturalistic, matter-of-fact manner, without fanfare and fuss and devoid of high-minded sermons or heavy-breathing lectures.

I would have given it 5 stars but I was put off at first and nearly switched the movie off.  In the beginning the characters are not very appealing.  I found myself wondering, ""Why should I care about these people?""  In fact, the movie does not ever grab you by the throat, but it does involve you, gently, confidently.  It feels very authentic.  Paul Rudd and Maura Tierney are exceptional (both give the best performances of their careers), but the entire cast is strong.  This is exactly what I love about indie filmmaking.  This will be a movie I will watch every once in a while, just to lose myself in a very defined time and place.",4,Well worth the time,1179446400,"05 18, 2007",2007,737,"['hearing', 'review', 'movie', 'Ebert', 'Roeper', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'one', 'had', 'see', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'first', 'nearly', 'switched', 'movie', 'off', 'beginning', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'appealing', 'found', 'wondering', 'Why', 'should', 'care', 'people', 'fact', 'movie', 'not', 'ever', 'grab', 'throat', 'involve', 'gently', 'confidently', 'very', 'authentic', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Maura', 'Tierney', 'are', 'exceptional', 'give', 'best', 'performances', 'careers', 'entire', 'cast', 'strong', 'exactly', 'what', 'love', 'indie', 'filmmaking', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'once', 'while', 'just', 'lose', 'very', 'defined', 'time', 'place']",Diggers
