It's not a perfect movie by any stretch, but it's a whole lot better than he makes it out to be, and since, at this time, he's the only other review, I thought it necessary to speak to the movie's strengths, which are many.  Once you strip away the seeming silliness of the whole LARP phenomenon, this movie is really about the human mind. You've got a lot of people here who delude themselves (as we all do). It's a little exaggerated here, but it's credible. The story is pretty basic, but throughout we are given quite perceptive examples of real humans with real flaws despite the whole framework of make-belief that surrounds everything. I was surprised by the movie. You have to dig beyond the surface to get to what's really there, though. I recommend it.",4,Much better than you'd think,1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,860,"['Im', 'writing', 'review', 'more', 'address', 'Mr', 'Matthew', 'Lane', 'review', 'totally', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'stretch', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'out', 'be', 'time', 'only', 'other', 'review', 'thought', 'necessary', 'speak', 'movie', 'strengths', 'are', 'many', 'Once', 'strip', 'away', 'seeming', 'silliness', 'whole', 'LARP', 'phenomenon', 'movie', 'really', 'human', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'got', 'lot', 'people', 'here', 'who', 'delude', 'do', 'little', 'exaggerated', 'here', 'credible', 'story', 'pretty', 'basic', 'are', 'given', 'quite', 'perceptive', 'examples', 'real', 'humans', 'real', 'flaws', 'whole', 'framework', 'make-belief', 'everything', 'was', 'surprised', 'movie', 'have', 'dig', 'surface', 'get', 'what', 'really', 'there', 'recommend']",Wild Hunt
1367207,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B003VIVCQE,Eric Sanberg,"[3, 4]","When I read the premise of this movie, as well as the outline, it all sounded rather silly and undoable. I was wrong. Could this have been done better? Probably. Given greater resources, it would have picked up a smoother sheen and probably a bit better scripting. But, given everything, this is a remarkable effort.Here's the scoop. Erik is taking care of his deteriorating father. His girlfriend has left him to hook up with the king of a Live Action Role Playing ensemble. He heads to the roll playing compound to win her back. They are in the midst of a game which stretches out over days. Eric's brother, Bjorn, (who has abandoned Erik in regard to father care responsibilities) is also a role player. Together they try to make all things right.This movie is amazing in its own right. As others have mentioned, a large amount of respect is paid to the players. They retreat to this world and give it everything they've got while involved. They are organized. They have a well built compound for the games. They have walkie-talkies for communication. They have referees and judges if something needs to be ruled upon. And they party hard when the day's games have finished. The film makers, though, do juxtapose them to the real world and don't shy away from showing that there is a certain amount of silliness to it all. You see this duality in the girlfriend, Lyn, (played by a very fetching Kaniehtiio Horn) who is at once drawn to the splendor and magnificence of it all, but put off when the fantasy is played too strongly. There are hints as to where all this is headed. You have two men in two worlds both vying for the same woman. Something has to give and it does so in brutal fashion. Things do escalate and things do get out of hand. The climax is both sad and horrifying. I feel the film makers should have showed the authorities getting involved at the end. It only makes sense but, for whatever reason, they chose not to.This was done on a rather limited budget but done extremely well. The camerawork was good enough but some of the shots were downright gorgeous. Editing and music were decent as were the costumes. Were this a larger Hollywood project I couldn't have given it 4 stars, but all things considered, this is more than a commendable outing. If you're at all into role playing games, this is worth seeing. If you're only mildly interested, as am I, it's still more than worth the time needed to watch it.

1367208,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003VIVCQE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Honestly, my expectations when approaching ""The Wild Hunt"" were fairly minimal. Even though this feature played very well at the edgier film festivals, something about the DVD's marketing made me believe that the movie might devolve into a rather pedestrian horror film after setting up its intriguing premise and setting. However, that didn't happen. The movie retained its integrity by remaining a psychological thriller where ordinary people are pushed into extreme circumstances. Whether or not you understand and appreciate the realm of Live Action Role Playing, it certainly makes for an undeniably interesting and dramatic atmosphere. Most entertainment that has featured the LARP phenomenon (Role Models, for example) have done so for comic affect. ""The Wild Hunt,"" however, inserts the viewer right into the heart of such a game--revealing both its inherent silliness and its romantic allure. But when can fantasy go too far? This is the question that haunts the central characters of the movie as a game spirals out of control.The story charts the progression of Erik. When his aloof girlfriend starts to become more distant, he attempts to reinvigorate their bond. But she has been caught up with a new man in the fantasy world of weekend game play. Following her to a big tournament (in which his brother plays a prominent role), he soon finds himself an unwitting part of the game. His only hope to communicate with her soon becomes a love quest as he assumes the role of a Viking hero. Real feelings, jealousy, and pride soon infect the fantasy realm and quitting the game isn't as easy as it would seem. In fact, as tensions rise, a real danger starts to bubble to the surface. But how will it manifest itself? And who, if anyone, will remain immune to the escalating tension?First of all, the movie scores high marks for presenting a unique and different world. I felt like I was watching something with a fair amount of originality--because this isn't a setting that has been explored in many dramatic features. I further appreciated that it didn't immediately devolve into a violent free-for-all. The characters remained relatively rational and stayed true to the context of the game. That was part of the film's appeal--how it balanced the eccentricities of its setting with real world decisions. The film works on several levels and scores with a delightfully off-kilter, but believable, ending. Exciting, silly, sad, funny--""The Wild Hunt"" certainly doesn't aspire to an Academy Award. But it is fitfully entertaining, surprising, and original and accomplishes the modest goals it set out for itself. If it sounds like you'd enjoy it, you probably will!

1367212,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003VIVCQE,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","A Canadian film ""The Wild Hunt"" involves LARP, or live-action role-playing game, where participants, usually in costumes, join in the game, acting out the roles given to them. In the game you can be a warrior, a priest, a princess or even an elf. Unlike online games, LARP doesn't use avatars, and the players ""fight"" for entertainment, sometimes using simulated weapons some of which awfully look real.Now what if someone determined to win back his estranged sweetheart in real world (who happens to be the kidnapped ""queen"" of the game's fantasy world) joins the LARP in Canadian woods, and breaks a few rules there to get what he wants? Well, in short, what if these players are a bit more in characters, on the night of ""The Wild Hunt""?Ricky Mabe plays Erik trying to persuade his girlfriend Evelyn (Tiio Horn) to come back home. What makes things complicated is, for Evelyn, who is fed up with the drab reality of her life, the roll-playing game is more than just a pastime. Also, Erik's brother Bjorn (Mark A. Krupa), helpful in his own way, is into the game, having so much fun. For him, this is a real Ragnar&ouml;k, great battle of the gods of Norse mythology. Bjorn's harmless joy becomes something else, however, when other players begin to take their roles more seriouslyI know nothing about the film's players, but their performances are overall very good. Clearly the film is made with a low budget, but costumes and production designs are decent, and the photography is surprisingly effective (most of the actions take place during the night).""The Wild Hunt"" is less a horror than a psychological thriller, and though the film is bumpy in places (the role-playing game itself is not very interesting with its hazy rules), and some part of the story is a bit too incredible, the film is pretty good with slick storytelling and some suspenseful moments.",4,(3.5 STARS) Taking a Live-Action Role-Playing Game a Bit Too Seriously,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,1866,"['Canadian', 'film', 'Wild', 'Hunt', 'LARP', 'live-action', 'role-playing', 'game', 'where', 'participants', 'usually', 'costumes', 'join', 'game', 'acting', 'out', 'roles', 'given', 'game', 'can', 'be', 'warrior', 'priest', 'princess', 'even', 'elf', 'online', 'games', 'LARP', ""n't"", 'use', 'avatars', 'players', 'fight', 'entertainment', 'sometimes', 'using', 'simulated', 'weapons', 'awfully', 'look', 'real.Now', 'what', 'someone', 'determined', 'win', 'back', 'estranged', 'sweetheart', 'real', 'world', 'who', 'be', 'kidnapped', 'queen', 'game', 'fantasy', 'world', 'LARP', 'Canadian', 'woods', 'few', 'rules', 'there', 'get', 'what', 'Well', 'short', 'what', 'players', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'characters', 'night', 'Wild', 'Hunt', 'Ricky', 'Mabe', 'Erik', 'trying', 'persuade', 'girlfriend', 'Evelyn', 'Tiio', 'Horn', 'come', 'back', 'home', 'What', 'things', 'complicated', 'Evelyn', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'drab', 'reality', 'life', 'roll-playing', 'game', 'more', 'just', 'pastime', 'Also', 'Erik', 'brother', 'Bjorn', 'Mark', 'A.', 'Krupa', 'helpful', 'own', 'way', 'game', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'real', 'Ragnar', 'ouml', 'k', 'great', 'battle', 'gods', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'Bjorn', 'harmless', 'joy', 'something', 'else', 'however', 'when', 'other', 'players', 'begin', 'take', 'roles', 'more', 'seriouslyI', 'know', 'nothing', 'film', 'players', 'performances', 'are', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'Clearly', 'film', 'made', 'low', 'budget', 'costumes', 'production', 'designs', 'are', 'decent', 'photography', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'most', 'actions', 'take', 'place', 'night', 'Wild', 'Hunt', 'less', 'horror', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'film', 'bumpy', 'places', 'role-playing', 'game', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'hazy', 'rules', 'part', 'story', 'bit', 'too', 'incredible', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'slick', 'storytelling', 'suspenseful', 'moments']",Wild Hunt
1367213,A3SMH6YL9T33YS,B003VIVCQE,West Mountain,"[0, 0]","Erik Magnusson is living a hopeless life. He is barely out of his teens but the pressures of earning enough money to survive, and caring for his senile ailing father, have exhausted him. Erik's resentment and despair are understandable: his older brother Bjorn disappears for months on end, leaving an overwhelmed Erik to manage alone. Even Erik's girlfriend Lyn deserts him, ostensibly to look for a job, but really to spend the weekend acting as a Viking princess at Bjorn's role-playing game in the woods.Erik is portrayed by Ricky Mabe, who's better known for his comedy work in films such as ""The Trotsky"", ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"", ""Goon"", and ABC Family's made-in-Toronto TV series ""Beautiful People"". There's very little comedy in ""The Wild Hunt""; however, Mabe puts in a strong performance in one of his first dramatic lead roles, which got some excellent reviews. Tiio Horn plays Lyn, Erik's moody dissatisfied love interest. She is in a love triangle with the older Celtic shaman Murtagh (Trevor Hayes). Not much is revealed about Murtagh's background, but he seems to have problems of his own, dealing with increasingly-violent and obsessive members of his group like the cruel Greg-ash (Kent McQuaid). Comic relief in this rather grim situation is provided by the outlandish antics of Erik's older brother Bjorn (Mark A. Krupa), the cynical King Argyle (Nicolas Wright), the timid would-be warrior David (Kyle Gatehouse), and Bjorn's nerdy accountant friend Bernie (Terry Simpson). Egged on by Bjorn and some of the other participants, Erik decides to enter the game's fantasy world and win back his girlfriend's affection. The players start choosing sides in the dispute, as do a couple of the referees (Claudia Jurt and Spiro Malandrakis) -- this makes the situation increasingly unstable, as people begin to break the rules to help Erik. As the game spins into chaos, the ominous ending hinted at early in the film is fully revealed, but with a twist.As Bjorn, carried away with the excitement of his younger brother's ""love quest"", makes them swear an oath on his representation of Thor's magical hammer, the reluctant Erik protests ""we were born in Canada!"" And so they were ... but the forest that engulfs them is not the pure unspoiled refuge of North American visionaries like Thoreau and Muir, but Europe's darker path of blood and madness alluded to by Simon Schama (""Landscape and Memory"").The film's cinematography is exceptional, for a relatively small-budget Canadian indie production. There's a stark contrast between mundane inner-city Montreal and the freedom and beauty of the woodland gaming site. To get there, Erik has to depart on a literal geographic as well as emotional quest. Mark A. Krupa is best known in Canada as a wilderness writer and TV host, so the undercurrent of enchantment and escapism in the outdoors scenes is probably not surprising - he also co-wrote the screenplay. The use of the Duchy of Bicolline near Shawinigan Quebec, an existing live-action roleplaying (LARP) compound -- and recruiting extras who are involved in the hobby -- conveys a colourful anachronistic atmosphere. Representing the perspective of most viewers, Erik is bewildered by the strange people he sees when he enters the compound to look for Lyn -- and frustrated by the elaborate system of rules that the referees insist he follow, such as wearing a period costume to comply with ""decorum"".This film is not intended to be an accurate depiction of LARP, the Society for Creative Anachronism, or historical re-enactment in Canada or anywhere else. Judging by online discussions, some players are concerned that audiences may get a negative impression of what they do. All I can say is, the LARP and re-enactment people I know who've seen this film generally enjoyed it, without taking it too seriously. Commented one online reviewer, ""it's not like anyone will actually be afraid of this happening for real; they're Canadians for God's sake"".More serious are some of the issues with first-time director Alexandre Franchi's script, which he co-wrote with Krupa. The story probably could have benefited from more editing, since it seems repetitive and slow-moving in the second half. Horn does her best, but Lyn's character is unevenly written -- she frequently seems so fickle that it strains credibility, something that might have been remedied if she'd had more lines or actions that could offer an insight into what she's thinking. Instead a lot of the burden for justifying their relationship is placed on Erik, as he shows his desperation to sustain even the illusion of romance in his drab life. Some key points in the story take place at night, but this can be confusing to follow as many scenes are dark and murky. (I'm cutting them some slack on this though, since some of the footage may have been shot by a skeleton crew of only four, including the director, at the site's scheduled Big Battle Weekend a month before the main shoot.) As for the DVD release, the extra features are a bit disappointing. Even a commentary track, by the writer/director or a few of the actors or production staff, would have been a welcome addition. In post-release interviews, Krupa hinted that the earlier love story showing the extent of Erik and Lyn's relationship had been cut -- it may have been helpful to the audience to see what brought them together in the first place, and what he meant by the ""serious problems"" in Lyn's background.The Wild Hunt won Best First Canadian Feature Film at The Toronto International Film Festival in
