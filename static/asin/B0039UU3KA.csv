1334282,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B0039UU3KA,William Timothy Lukeman,"[67, 69]","At last!While it's only the superb pilot film for this long-lost but not forgotten TV series, at least it's finally available on an official DVD, rather than on faded, jumpy bootlegs. Not only that, but it features additional footage from the European theatrical release, never before seen in the United States.So what is it about this story of man & motorcycle that makes so many remember it with such fondness? Part of it is the lure of the open road, the sense of freedom. Part of it is the deeply personal motivation of Jim Bronson, trying to make sense of life after the suicide of an old friend. And part of it is the ethos of a vanished time & sensibility, when searching for meaning in this world was considered a worthwhile pursuit. That final part is even more pressing today, when the world seems to worship money, success, fame, and the superficial illusions of the consumerist culture above all else.Jim Bronson offered a fascinating model of manhood, one that sadly wasn't followed. He combined the best of the old-fashioned style of manhood -- responsibility, honor, integrity -- with the best of the newer, youthful model -- a disdain for violence, a genuine desire to understand others, a need to live life on honest terms. Rather than go to the extremes of the blustering macho man vs. the overly wimpy New Age guy, he steered a middle course between them. In the entire series, he only ever threw one punch, and that one in this pilot film. Yet he never backed down from confronting injustice or aggressive ignorance.Here we see Jim Bronson quitting his life as a reporter, after having seen too much of the worst side of humanity. When he picks up runaway bride Temple Brooks (a luminous young Bonnie Bedelia), the two begin an odyssey that enlarges both their lives. Yet the expected romance doesn't follow the usual formula, nor does it end as might be expected. Jim & Temple are on parallel paths, and those paths never truly cross; they merely run close beside each other for a time.An especially delightful & insightful sequence finds them stopping at the desert home of a mentor & father figure, Jim's friend Papa Bear. The boisterous old artist lives & works with a brood of eager children, and is pleased as can be to have Jim visit. But he can see what's troubling his young friend, for he went through the same thing himself. The quiet dialogue between the two is touching & wise.For those who haven't seen the film yet, I won't say anything more about the plot. Suffice it to say that comparisons to ""Easy Rider"" are a bit simplistic. For my money, this is a better & more thoughtful story; it has far more in common with the likes of ""Route 66."" And like that fabled series, here's hoping that the solitary season of ""Then Came Bronson"" will also be released on official DVD.Meanwhile, the film is here, and there's plenty to enjoy. It's a very rewatchable tale, which should leave the viewers mulling over their own lives & the paths they've taken (or haven't) -- most highly recommended!Note: I got my copy directly from the Warner Brothers site, where it's far less expensive.",5,Goin' down that long lonesome highway ...,1259712000,"12 2, 2009",2009,3111,"['last', 'only', 'superb', 'pilot', 'film', 'long-lost', 'not', 'forgotten', 'TV', 'series', 'least', 'finally', 'available', 'official', 'DVD', 'rather', 'faded', 'jumpy', 'bootlegs', 'Not', 'only', 'additional', 'footage', 'European', 'theatrical', 'release', 'never', 'seen', 'United', 'States.So', 'what', 'story', 'man', 'motorcycle', 'so', 'many', 'remember', 'such', 'fondness', 'Part', 'lure', 'open', 'road', 'sense', 'freedom', 'Part', 'deeply', 'personal', 'motivation', 'Jim', 'Bronson', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'life', 'suicide', 'old', 'friend', 'part', 'ethos', 'vanished', 'time', 'sensibility', 'when', 'searching', 'meaning', 'world', 'was', 'considered', 'worthwhile', 'pursuit', 'final', 'part', 'even', 'more', 'pressing', 'today', 'when', 'world', 'worship', 'money', 'success', 'fame', 'superficial', 'illusions', 'consumerist', 'culture', 'else.Jim', 'Bronson', 'offered', 'fascinating', 'model', 'manhood', 'one', 'sadly', 'was', ""n't"", 'followed', 'combined', 'best', 'old-fashioned', 'style', 'manhood', 'responsibility', 'honor', 'integrity', 'best', 'newer', 'youthful', 'model', 'disdain', 'violence', 'genuine', 'desire', 'understand', 'others', 'need', 'live', 'life', 'honest', 'terms', 'Rather', 'go', 'extremes', 'blustering', 'macho', 'man', 'overly', 'wimpy', 'New', 'Age', 'guy', 'steered', 'middle', 'course', 'entire', 'series', 'only', 'ever', 'threw', 'one', 'punch', 'one', 'pilot', 'film', 'never', 'backed', 'down', 'confronting', 'injustice', 'aggressive', 'ignorance.Here', 'see', 'Jim', 'Bronson', 'quitting', 'life', 'reporter', 'having', 'seen', 'too', 'much', 'worst', 'side', 'humanity', 'When', 'up', 'runaway', 'Temple', 'Brooks', 'luminous', 'young', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'two', 'begin', 'odyssey', 'lives', 'expected', 'romance', ""n't"", 'follow', 'usual', 'formula', 'end', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'Jim', 'Temple', 'are', 'parallel', 'paths', 'paths', 'never', 'truly', 'cross', 'merely', 'run', 'close', 'other', 'time.An', 'especially', 'delightful', 'insightful', 'sequence', 'stopping', 'desert', 'home', 'mentor', 'father', 'figure', 'Jim', 'friend', 'Papa', 'Bear', 'boisterous', 'old', 'artist', 'brood', 'eager', 'children', 'pleased', 'can', 'be', 'have', 'Jim', 'visit', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'troubling', 'young', 'friend', 'went', 'same', 'thing', 'quiet', 'dialogue', 'two', 'touching', 'wise.For', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'yet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'plot', 'Suffice', 'say', 'comparisons', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'are', 'bit', 'simplistic', 'money', 'better', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'common', 'likes', 'Route', '66', 'fabled', 'series', 'here', 'hoping', 'solitary', 'season', 'Then', 'Came', 'Bronson', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'released', 'official', 'DVD.Meanwhile', 'film', 'here', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'very', 'rewatchable', 'tale', 'should', 'leave', 'viewers', 'mulling', 'own', 'lives', 'paths', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'have', ""n't"", 'most', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Note', 'got', 'copy', 'directly', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'site', 'where', 'far', 'less', 'expensive']",N/A
