738231,ATI0FJ3TWV85G,B00008DDGP,BellShock,"[7, 11]","Very Good Story, but there are just a couple of problems.  The First being that the story tends to be kind of choppy, but that's understandable.  But the other problem is Much More Serious, at least to Me.  There is a Really Really Annoying Song that the Narrator Sings in between scenes, and it makes You want to hit the MUTE Button on Your TV, and that kind of defeats the purpose of watching.  You can't expect Kids to take something like this seriously, if there's going to be this song that makes them want to barf!  The song is Completely Unnecessary, and could be replaced with just instrumental music if needed.",2,"Very Good Story, But....",1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,619,"['Very', 'Good', 'Story', 'are', 'just', 'couple', 'problems', 'First', 'being', 'story', 'be', 'kind', 'choppy', 'understandable', 'other', 'problem', 'Much', 'More', 'Serious', 'least', 'Me', 'Really', 'Really', 'Annoying', 'Song', 'Narrator', 'Sings', 'scenes', 'want', 'hit', 'MUTE', 'Button', 'Your', 'TV', 'kind', 'defeats', 'purpose', 'watching', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Kids', 'take', 'something', 'seriously', 'going', 'be', 'song', 'want', 'barf', 'song', 'Completely', 'Unnecessary', 'could', 'be', 'replaced', 'just', 'instrumental', 'music', 'needed']",N/A
738232,A2G4Q94HI16FK9,B00008DDGP,Cart,"[14, 16]","This video should have been called ""The Story of Abraham"" instead of Sodom and Gomarrah; the whole video was strictly about Abraham; Sodom and Gomorrah was only a brief part of this video.I did not give this video a 5 for the following reasons:1) Certain parts of the story were left out which were part of the biblical text; while other parts were inserted which were not part of the text. These parts that were added were not contradictary to the scriptures, but I would rather have seen biblical parts than non biblical (speculation).2)Abraham is depicted as chosen by God because of his own righteousness; because he loved the truth. While it might have been true that he loved the truth, the biblical picture is more along the lines of God choosing people out of his own good pleasure. God didn't call any of us because we were good, but because he loved us.3) This goes with point #1- Melchisedec was not in the story- this scene was left out. When the Angels went to Lot's house to abide, the part where the Sodomites tried to break down the door, etc. was left out. I am not sure why this was left out, but probably because they didn't want to offend Sodomites. I understand that we shouldn't purposely offend people, but to leave part of the text out is just nonsense and compromise.There were small things here and there that I didn't care for but overall this was a good video. It is not nearly as bad as the ""Garden of Eden"" video. I think it can be a profitable video for your children to watch as long as you are able to fill them in on the parts that are lacking (or added that are not necessarily true).",4,Pretty good,1171497600,"02 15, 2007",2007,1619,"['video', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Story', 'Abraham', 'instead', 'Sodom', 'Gomarrah', 'whole', 'video', 'was', 'strictly', 'Abraham', 'Sodom', 'Gomorrah', 'was', 'only', 'brief', 'part', 'video.I', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'video', '5', 'following', 'reasons:1', 'Certain', 'parts', 'story', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'were', 'part', 'biblical', 'text', 'other', 'parts', 'were', 'inserted', 'were', 'not', 'part', 'text', 'parts', 'were', 'added', 'were', 'not', 'contradictary', 'scriptures', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'biblical', 'parts', 'non', 'biblical', 'speculation', '.2', 'Abraham', 'depicted', 'chosen', 'God', 'own', 'righteousness', 'loved', 'truth', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'loved', 'truth', 'biblical', 'picture', 'more', 'lines', 'God', 'choosing', 'people', 'own', 'good', 'pleasure', 'God', 'did', ""n't"", 'call', 'were', 'good', 'loved', 'us.3', 'point', '1-', 'Melchisedec', 'was', 'not', 'story-', 'scene', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'When', 'Angels', 'went', 'Lot', 'house', 'abide', 'part', 'where', 'Sodomites', 'tried', 'break', 'down', 'door', 'etc', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'offend', 'Sodomites', 'understand', 'should', ""n't"", 'purposely', 'offend', 'people', 'leave', 'part', 'text', 'out', 'just', 'nonsense', 'compromise.There', 'were', 'small', 'things', 'here', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'overall', 'was', 'good', 'video', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'video', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'profitable', 'video', 'children', 'watch', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'able', 'fill', 'parts', 'are', 'lacking', 'added', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'true']",N/A

The animation quality is like that typically seen in basic Saturday morning cartoons, which is good enough for kids. What I like is that all the videos in this series give all the important details of the story, rather than giving a shallow, watered-down version as is usually the case in children's stories. These will entertain preschoolers up through junior high and the script is very closely based on the scriptural account. Each video is 45-50 minutes long. The only reason I didn't give this series a 5 is that each video has a hokey song that could definitely have been left out, but for such a low price and good script, I can overlook that.",4,Great value,1121990400,"07 22, 2005",2005,705,"['ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'price', 'so', 'low', 'animation', 'quality', 'typically', 'seen', 'basic', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'good', 'enough', 'kids', 'What', 'like', 'videos', 'series', 'give', 'important', 'details', 'story', 'rather', 'giving', 'shallow', 'watered-down', 'version', 'usually', 'case', 'children', 'stories', 'will', 'entertain', 'preschoolers', 'up', 'junior', 'high', 'script', 'very', 'closely', 'based', 'scriptural', 'account', 'video', '45-50', 'minutes', 'long', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'series', '5', 'video', 'hokey', 'song', 'could', 'definitely', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'such', 'low', 'price', 'good', 'script', 'can', 'overlook']",N/A
