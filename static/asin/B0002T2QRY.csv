844788,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B0002T2QRY,Brent Butler,"[1, 1]","For decades, Bob Hope took shows around the world to entertain troops stationed in every remote corner. Each year he was joined by different groups of entertainers who generously donated their time during the holidays as well.Set against the backdrop of a Christmas party at the home of Bob and his wife Delores, this DVD features clips from both Bob's USO shows and his Christmas specials through the years. Yes, Bob's humor was filled with corny one liners, but that never detracted from how much he could make everyone laugh.Included on this DVD you'll find classic skits with Bing Crosby, Red Skelton, Loni Anderson and Phyllis Diller, John Forsythe, and a few more. There are USO show clips going back to Korea in the early 50s. Included are a few of the funnier moments that occured when Bob introduced the AP All American football teams each year on his Christmas special. Late in the DVD there is a very nice sequence with Bob and Delores singing Silver Bells, with cuts to various times Bob has performed that song over the years.As a special feature, there are a few outtakes from Bob's many Christmas specials, and those are also a lot of fun. However, to be honest, Bob ad libbed so much that sometimes the outtakes don't seem a lot different from what made it on the air! LOLBob's contribution to entertainment and to generosity of spirit should never be forgotten, and I hope this DVD helps to preserve his memory in the hearts and minds of all of us.Thanks for the Memories, Bob!",4,Very funny look back at a treasure of a man,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,1494,"['decades', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'took', 'shows', 'world', 'entertain', 'troops', 'stationed', 'remote', 'corner', 'year', 'was', 'joined', 'different', 'groups', 'entertainers', 'who', 'generously', 'donated', 'time', 'holidays', 'well.Set', 'backdrop', 'Christmas', 'party', 'home', 'Bob', 'wife', 'Delores', 'DVD', 'clips', 'Bob', 'USO', 'shows', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'years', 'Yes', 'Bob', 'humor', 'was', 'filled', 'corny', 'one', 'liners', 'never', 'detracted', 'how', 'much', 'could', 'make', 'everyone', 'laugh.Included', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'find', 'classic', 'skits', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'Loni', 'Anderson', 'Phyllis', 'Diller', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'few', 'more', 'are', 'USO', 'show', 'going', 'back', 'Korea', 'early', '50s', 'Included', 'are', 'few', 'funnier', 'moments', 'occured', 'when', 'Bob', 'introduced', 'AP', 'All', 'American', 'football', 'teams', 'year', 'Christmas', 'special', 'Late', 'DVD', 'very', 'nice', 'sequence', 'Bob', 'Delores', 'singing', 'Silver', 'Bells', 'cuts', 'various', 'times', 'Bob', 'performed', 'song', 'years.As', 'special', 'feature', 'are', 'few', 'outtakes', 'Bob', 'many', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'However', 'be', 'honest', 'Bob', 'ad', 'libbed', 'so', 'much', 'outtakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'lot', 'different', 'what', 'made', 'air', 'LOLBob', 'contribution', 'entertainment', 'generosity', 'spirit', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'hope', 'DVD', 'preserve', 'memory', 'hearts', 'minds', 'us.Thanks', 'Memories', 'Bob']",Bob Hope - Hope for the Holidays

It was very enjoyable... though I do wish it was much longer in length.  Actually I would love it - and I'm sure others as well here? - if someone could just do a documentary on Bob Hope's Christmas shows for our nation's troops over the years.  To me this was the funniest and most nostalgic part of the DVD seeing him and his guests - esp. his beautiful female guest stars, some who were singers - interacting with the troops during various war times.

I can clearly remember waiting patiently each year for Bob Hope's Annual Christmas Special on NBC.  This DVD did not disappoint me in anyway.  There is footage of various skits with Bob Hope and just about every famous celebrity of that era. Even the bonus material containing a number of bloopers was great to watch.Back in those days, there were only three stations or three networks to watch (ABC, CBS and NBC), but it seemed that there was always something great on TV, no matter what night of the week it was.  NBC was lucky enough to have Bob Hope for so many incredible years.  I truly have to applaud Bob Hope for entertaining our troops each and every year at Christmas and this DVD has quite a few memorable clips from the 50's through the 80's of Bob in some foreign Country with a great looking gal, parading around on the stage. If you are a fan of Bob Hope, or you'd like to experience just one more of Bob Hope's Annual Christmas Specials, then do NOT pass up this unique opportunity.  I assure you that you will NOT be disappointed. As far as the quality is concerned, it's not HD but it's still pretty darn good, even on a 55"" screen.I have already watched this DVD two nights in a row and I will probably play it again some night before Christmas this year.
