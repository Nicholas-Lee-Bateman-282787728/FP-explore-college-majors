""brnn64""","[3, 3]","Folks, let's get real, don't follow the stupidity of overanalyzing this with PC interpretations and looking for hidden messages about race relations and slavery. This film is not about any of that! It's basically a charming little story about a little girl whose mother sends her out to play and she meets a turtle (Danny Glover) who introduces her to the wonderful world of the Brer Rabbit stories.Although this is based more on folkmaster Julius Lester's translations (from the original heavy dialect of Joel Chandler Harris's 19th century transcriptions of these slave stories) than the Disney film, its still quite good and the original wascally wabbit's tales are quite entertaining. Wanda Sykes is particularly loveable as Sister Moon and Nick Cannon is well cast as the heroic hare.Children are bound to love this and adults (once they stop the overanalysis) will enjoy it too with an open mind. As for the comparison with SONG OF THE SOUTH, this one has more on Brer Rabbit and the ""creetures"" (as Uncle Remus pit it) than Uncle Remus himself. SOTS ony had three cartoons dealing with Brer Rabbit while this has about three times as many episodes. I look at this more as a modern counterpart to SOTS as opposed to something that degrades the older film (I personally feels this compliments both SOTS and the Joel Harris books). In either case, get it and laugh.",5,Watch it with a child's point of view,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,1369,"['Folks', 'let', 'get', 'real', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'stupidity', 'overanalyzing', 'PC', 'interpretations', 'looking', 'hidden', 'messages', 'race', 'relations', 'slavery', 'film', 'not', 'basically', 'charming', 'little', 'story', 'little', 'girl', 'mother', 'out', 'play', 'turtle', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'who', 'wonderful', 'world', 'Brer', 'Rabbit', 'based', 'more', 'folkmaster', 'Julius', 'Lester', 'translations', 'original', 'heavy', 'dialect', 'Joel', 'Chandler', 'Harris', '19th', 'century', 'transcriptions', 'slave', 'stories', 'Disney', 'film', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'original', 'wascally', 'wabbit', 'tales', 'are', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'particularly', 'loveable', 'Sister', 'Moon', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'well', 'cast', 'heroic', 'hare.Children', 'are', 'bound', 'love', 'adults', 'stop', 'overanalysis', 'will', 'enjoy', 'too', 'open', 'mind', 'comparison', 'SONG', 'THE', 'SOUTH', 'one', 'more', 'Brer', 'Rabbit', 'creetures', 'Uncle', 'Remus', 'Uncle', 'Remus', 'SOTS', 'ony', 'had', 'three', 'cartoons', 'dealing', 'Brer', 'Rabbit', 'about', 'three', 'times', 'many', 'episodes', 'look', 'more', 'modern', 'counterpart', 'SOTS', 'opposed', 'something', 'older', 'film', 'personally', 'feels', 'compliments', 'SOTS', 'Joel', 'Harris', 'books', 'case', 'get', 'laugh']",The Adventures of Brer Rabbit

This is not a ""Gone with the Wind"" throwback with happy Negroes caring for the needs of White folks (nothing wrong with loving each other but this is 2009, those ""Driving Miss Daisy"" images should be put to rest.That being said this is agreat family movie.  The voice characterizations are wonderful and the animation is very good.  This movie is funny, witty, and intelligent.  Brer Rabbit is still Brer Rabbit and he gets taught some well deserved lessons along the way.One review said this was a vain attempt to make a ""POLITICALLY CORRECT"" version of an old ""classic.""  I doubt the writers even had that in mind.  This is just a good, funny cartoon with excellent African-American voice characterizations.  Ignore the ignorant and negative reviews.
