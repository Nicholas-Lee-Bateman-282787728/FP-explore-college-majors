42468,ADFJMD98M5HLM,0783111037,C. Andrews,"[0, 0]","If the Red October had been a normal sub, it would have positioned itself off the American coast as a form of intimidation while cruising around with it's missiles targeted.  The Dallas would have pursued it as quietly as possible to show that we knew they were there, and could take them out at the last minute if need be.In this scenario, the K-219 is pursued by the ""Aurora"" which slides into it's baffles.  The subs go silent to wait each other out, but the Soviet captain performs a crazy Ivan to bring himself about on his pursuer.  The subs lose exact track of each other, and a glancing blow leads to a leak in one missile silo, the resulting gas expansion forcing the Russian to the surface to attempt a venting before it loses the missile, or worse.Despite any conflict with actual events, fans of submariner films will find this interesting and suspenseful.",5,Helps to serve as background to Hunt For Red October,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,868,"['Red', 'October', 'had', 'been', 'normal', 'sub', 'would', 'have', 'positioned', 'off', 'American', 'coast', 'form', 'intimidation', 'cruising', 'missiles', 'targeted', 'Dallas', 'would', 'have', 'pursued', 'as', 'quietly', 'possible', 'show', 'knew', 'were', 'there', 'could', 'take', 'out', 'last', 'minute', 'need', 'be.In', 'scenario', 'K-219', 'pursued', 'Aurora', 'baffles', 'subs', 'go', 'silent', 'wait', 'other', 'out', 'Soviet', 'captain', 'crazy', 'Ivan', 'bring', 'pursuer', 'subs', 'lose', 'exact', 'track', 'other', 'glancing', 'blow', 'leak', 'one', 'missile', 'silo', 'resulting', 'gas', 'expansion', 'forcing', 'Russian', 'surface', 'attempt', 'venting', 'missile', 'worse.Despite', 'conflict', 'actual', 'events', 'fans', 'submariner', 'films', 'will', 'find', 'interesting', 'suspenseful']",Hostile Waters VHS

Unbelievable courage in the face of overwhelmingadversity.  Once the  reactor cooling system was damaged it took everything they had to contain the disasterand escape with their sub in tact and their lives.  Rutger Hauer puts on a very realistic performance asthe skipper of the Russian Sub.  Highly recommend this movie.,5,"SUBMARINE  ,  movie recants the non-ficticious events of a russian nuclear accident.",1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,472,"['anyone', 'ever', 'been', 'sea', 'then', 'watching', 'movie', 'just', 'experience', 'what', 'Russiansaboard', 'k-19', 'submarine', 'went', 'real', 'life', 'Unbelievable', 'courage', 'face', 'overwhelmingadversity', 'reactor', 'cooling', 'system', 'was', 'damaged', 'took', 'everything', 'had', 'contain', 'disasterand', 'escape', 'sub', 'tact', 'lives', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'very', 'realistic', 'performance', 'asthe', 'skipper', 'Russian', 'Sub', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",Hostile Waters VHS
42470,A3QB4HSC4NJBH9,0783111037,Larry G.,"[0, 0]",I know this movie well from the vhs days. Rutger Hauer is the star of this movie. I don't think anyone else could have played his role with such believe ability as he did. If you want to see him in another great role get a copy of The Hitcher. Not that lousy remake they did a couple of years ago but the original that he stars in. It's a great thriller movie. I don't mean lots of blood & gore but a keep you on the edge of your seat kind of movie such as this one. This movie is also based on an actual event during the Cold War even though the U.S. denies it ever happened.,4,Glad to be getting this on dvd,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,576,"['know', 'movie', 'well', 'vhs', 'days', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'star', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'such', 'believe', 'ability', 'did', 'want', 'see', 'great', 'role', 'get', 'copy', 'Hitcher', 'Not', 'lousy', 'remake', 'did', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'original', 'great', 'thriller', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'lots', 'blood', 'gore', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'kind', 'movie', 'such', 'one', 'movie', 'also', 'based', 'actual', 'event', 'Cold', 'War', 'even', 'U.S.', 'ever', 'happened']",Hostile Waters VHS

42473,A2N46J4SPXJ09U,0783111037,Robert Stribley,"[9, 12]","Little more than a serviceable introduction to the historical proceedings. Wooden acting all round. In fact, Sheen looks like he's sleepwalking (or punchdrunk) through the thing. Still, Hauer does manage to conjure some sympathy as the Russian captain who does his best to save all his men, though, regardless of what he does, he can't win back home with the Soviet officials. Otherwise, there are handful of interesting insights into submarine culture--if what we're seeing is an accurate portrayal.Overall, Hostile Waters the feel of a mediocre (to bad) TV movie (which I'm assuming it isn't), including some particularly unconvincing special effects--to the extent that, though this was made in 1997, I would've guessed '87. It just looks that dated.
