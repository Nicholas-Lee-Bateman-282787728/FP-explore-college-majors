I just have to remember that the labels are switched.I enjoyed the workout for the most part. Leslie is a tad chatty on this one. But, I enjoyed the interval or ""boosted"" walking. It was a change of pace. I find that I actually work harder with the DVD's than I do on the treadmill at the gym. And, it is nice to get the upper body work.So far, Leslie has the best walking workouts. I have DVD's from other trainers (Prevention, Kathy Smith, Denise Austin) but I just don't enjoy them as much. I like how Leslie focuses on health rather than weight loss. I think that will help me to stay on track because I will focus on how I feel rather than how much I weigh.",4,Good Walking Workout - Bad Labeling,1209945600,"05 5, 2008",2008,760,"['Similar', 'T.', 'Smith', 'discs', 'were', 'mislabeled', 'decided', 'keep', 'rather', 'send', 'back', 'just', 'have', 'remember', 'labels', 'are', 'switched.I', 'workout', 'most', 'part', 'Leslie', 'tad', 'chatty', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'interval', 'boosted', 'walking', 'was', 'change', 'pace', 'find', 'actually', 'work', 'harder', 'DVD', 'do', 'treadmill', 'gym', 'nice', 'get', 'upper', 'body', 'work.So', 'far', 'Leslie', 'best', 'walking', 'workouts', 'have', 'DVD', 'other', 'trainers', 'Prevention', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'how', 'Leslie', 'health', 'rather', 'weight', 'loss', 'think', 'will', 'help', 'stay', 'track', 'will', 'focus', 'how', 'feel', 'rather', 'how', 'much', 'weigh']",Leslie Sansone's Walk At Home: Walk Slim

It seems production was rushed and it did not get any editing as I can see the camera guy cruising by in the background no less than 2-3 times in the two mile walk. Also as other reviews have noted, the two dvd's ARE MISLABLED which shows lack of attention or care. Leslie does not act like herself in these two workouts either. She's way too goofy and out of it, chatting about who knows what while she's out of step and changing things up without letting us know. I tried to do the 3 mile tonight but after just 3 minutes of it I was so annoyed at the program I had to take it out and put in her walk/jog dvd instead.

1067401,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B000OYCMMG,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[0, 0]","The need for exercise, walking, after a heart attack and cardio-rehabilitation motivated me to try this great DVD. Living in the Midwest creates a weather challenge.  Leslie Sansone offers an indoor alternative that is safe and similar to the treadmill, bicycle, and step workouts during my cardio-rehab therapy.When the pace picks up (cardio-rehab had me walking 4 mph on an incline) to a jog, I simply followed Leslie's instructions and used walking and sidesteps till I could rejoin the routine.  The workouts in this set brought me to a comparable sweat, but not quite the peak of blood pressure, a VERY GOOD, COMFORTABLE, AND SAFE EXPERIENCE.Since borrowing this set and others from the library for a trial run, I have purchased several Leslie Sansone workout DVDs to be used as my life-style exercise change for a fitter, healthier, heart-safe future.  Another plus, my wife and I can exercise TOGETHER because this DVD meets both our needs and abilities.It's not for wimp's, but I am over 60, and this is doable.  Of course, any heart patient should get approval for their own condition.

1067405,A179Z7ZOBCU4B8,B000OYCMMG,L. Carpenter,"[50, 50]","There are two DVDs in the case.  The first one is called Fast Start and has a 2 mile interval walk on it (she lets you know when one mile is done so if you don't want to do 2 miles, you can skip to the cool down).  She does her usual moves (marching, side steps, knee lifts, hamstring curls)  and every few minutes gives the option of doing a higher intensity burst (jog instead of march, leg swings instead of side steps).  It's a perfectly fine workout and I'm sure lots of people will like it, but it didn't really appeal to me and I don't know how much use I'll get out of it.  The second DVD is called 3 Fast Miles. It moves along at a pretty brisk pace.  She throws in a few extra moves that you don't usually see in her workouts.  Don't worry, the steps are still easy enought to catch onto, and it adds a nice bit of variety to the usual fare.  There are some spots where her cueing is off, but after a couple times through you know where they are and can anticipate it.  Also, late in the workout she has MaryKay lead for a little bit, but she isn't miked so you have to watch her hands to know what move is coming up. The good news is,  this workout has some of the best music she's ever used.  It's very up tempo and some of it is actual recognizable songs with lyrics.  It makes it feel kind of party-like to me and Leslie herself is quite obviously having fun here.

I have and enjoy many of the workouts that include utilization of the props, but their use typically slows the pace of the walking during that section.This workout features some of the regulars that those of you who have been doing Leslie for a while will recognize:  Carol, Jo, Linda, Mary Kay - as well as her 14 year old daugher, Marie, and 20 year old niece, whose name I can't recall.  These women don't seem to be aging, but improving, so if it's the walking doing it for them, I'm ""in""!I bought this DVD for the 3 mile workout, which actually clocked out to take place in about 38-40 minutes, with the stretch taking up the remaining workout time listed.  The workout is high energy and everyone seems to be having giddy fun.The only reason I rated it a 4 is because this is not one of Leslie's best cueing jobs.  She typically does a pretty good job of cuing, but there were numerous places where even her ""class"" was caught off guard - and one place where she apologizes.  It doesn't detract at all from the workout - and if you've been doing her workouts for a while, you'll be able to follow along.  After all, as she repeatedly tells us, you can't do these workouts wrong.I mention this mainly for those who are considering this as their first purchase.  If you start out with the 1 and 2 Mile Walk, by the time you work up to the 3 mile, you'll be a veteran and won't be troubled by this at all.  However, if this is the first workout you do, this one is not really indicative of her usual cueing.  All that said, I'll take the few very minor flubs that come with this infectiously fun workout any day.As I've said before in other Leslie Sansone reviews, when a friend told me about these workouts, I thought walking in front of your TV was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of.  But I tried one and got hooked.  I find these workouts easier on my sensitive feet and I get more mileage in than when I use my treadmill.  There is no fancy footwork to learn - if you can walk, side step, lift your knees and kick, you can do this workout ... and if you don't want to do those things, just keep marching.  It really is that easy. If you've never exercised before, this is a great way to start - and if you're already regularly exercising, check out the reviews to find the ones that are a little more demanding.",4,Spirited High Energy with No Props!,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,2468,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'walking', 'workout', 'props', 'stretchie', 'band', 'belt', 'weights', 'then', 'one', 'have', 'enjoy', 'many', 'workouts', 'include', 'utilization', 'props', 'use', 'typically', 'pace', 'walking', 'workout', 'regulars', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'Leslie', 'while', 'will', 'recognize', 'Carol', 'Jo', 'Linda', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'as', 'well', '14', 'year', 'old', 'daugher', 'Marie', '20', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'aging', 'improving', 'so', 'walking', 'doing', ""'m"", 'bought', 'DVD', '3', 'mile', 'workout', 'actually', 'clocked', 'out', 'take', 'place', '38-40', 'minutes', 'stretch', 'taking', 'up', 'remaining', 'workout', 'time', 'listed', 'workout', 'high', 'energy', 'everyone', 'be', 'having', 'giddy', 'fun.The', 'only', 'reason', 'rated', '4', 'not', 'one', 'Leslie', 'best', 'cueing', 'jobs', 'typically', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'cuing', 'were', 'numerous', 'places', 'where', 'even', 'class', 'was', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'one', 'place', 'where', ""n't"", 'detract', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'workouts', 'while', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'along', 'repeatedly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'workouts', 'wrong.I', 'mention', 'mainly', 'who', 'are', 'considering', 'first', 'purchase', 'start', 'out', '1', '2', 'Mile', 'Walk', 'time', 'work', 'up', '3', 'mile', ""'ll"", 'be', 'veteran', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'troubled', 'However', 'first', 'workout', 'do', 'one', 'not', 'really', 'indicative', 'usual', 'cueing', 'said', ""'ll"", 'take', 'few', 'very', 'minor', 'flubs', 'infectiously', 'day.As', ""'ve"", 'said', 'other', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'when', 'friend', 'told', 'workouts', 'thought', 'walking', 'front', 'TV', 'was', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'tried', 'one', 'got', 'hooked', 'find', 'workouts', 'easier', 'sensitive', 'feet', 'get', 'more', 'mileage', 'when', 'use', 'treadmill', 'fancy', 'footwork', 'learn', 'can', 'walk', 'side', 'step', 'lift', 'knees', 'kick', 'can', 'do', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'things', 'just', 'keep', 'marching', 'really', 'easy', ""'ve"", 'never', 'exercised', 'before', 'great', 'way', 'start', ""'re"", 'already', 'regularly', 'exercising', 'check', 'out', 'reviews', 'find', 'ones', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'demanding']",Leslie Sansone's Walk At Home: Walk Slim

I then discovered that she was available via my TV with on demand so was walking the same one mile as I had done in the past.  I have always been an exercise junkie, but injuries prevented me from doing what I had in the past so pretty much became a power walker in the nice weather.  I decided to buy the DVD as the weather had been dreary and I could walk inside as well as do my exercise bike.  It was far better then I had anticipated as it is more then just power walking, but a good aerobic work out which I missed doing and this was not something that would be harmful to me.  I have only done the 2 miles, looking forward to the 3 miles as the 2 miles is a breeze.  I love how she instructs and motivates you with her smile and energy.  Best of all I have no excuse not to workout as I do my stretches in the morning as I always have done , put in the DVD without the need to change into workout clothes and get going.

1067409,A3MFB2Z14O2ORN,B000OYCMMG,"Space Monkey ""exercise junkie""","[0, 0]","I own a LOT of Leslie's workouts, and generally I like them all.  I walk with her at least 3 days a week, in-between my heavier days when I do weight/resistance training.  I have found that her walking workouts are great for recovery days, but you still get in a nice workout that gets blood to the muscles and helps them recover.  She does very basic moves that anyone can follow, and the upbeat attitude of her workouts keeps me motivated.  However, with this particular workout, I found the quality to be very poor when compared to her other workouts.  The first thing that should have tipped me off was the fact that this two-disc set (a 2-mile workout with jogging intervals and a 3-mile walking workout) had the discs mislabeled--the 2-mile walk was labeled as the 3-mile, and vice-versa.The Fast Start 1 & 2 mile I did first, and I really enjoyed it.  I always love her workouts with the jogging intervals (or, as she calls it, ""boosted walking"").  It was about 30 minutes, got my heart rate up, and was a nicely organized workout.  However, the 3-mile walk was the most disorganized video I've ever seen from her.  She would start and stop moves without cueing properly, or tell you a move was coming up but then make you walk forever first because, as she states, ""I wasn't ready!""  What got me at the end was when she all of a sudden tells Mary Kay to lead (I don't think Mary Kay was expecting this, because she wasn't wearing a mic!).  Then, Mary Kay had to lead us through a few moves with you not being able to hear her or have her verbally cue you as to what was coming next.  But, because the whole workout was a disorganized mess, my heart rate didn't get very high, and I didn't feel like I got a good workout at all--I felt like I wasted 40 minutes of my precious workout time I set aside for myself every morning.  This is the first workout by Leslie where I have EVER felt that way when I was done.Overall, I was very disappointed with this purchase.  I will continue to do the Fast Start 1 & 2 mile workout, but, as for the 3-mile workout, I wouldn't even give that away--I wouldn't want to put someone else through that.

1067410,A3MPVYOMTMKE8Z,B000OYCMMG,Tawanda Grant,"[0, 0]",I bought this DVD last night because it was on sale. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it so much. I do a bootcamp class 3x a week but the weather kept us from exercising and this video provided a good workout. I added heavy weights to make it more challenging. I definitely would recommend it to beginners and intermediates. I am going to buy the 5 mile and give my mother a copy of this one.,5,Great Workout,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,387,"['bought', 'DVD', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'sale', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'enjoy', 'so', 'much', 'do', 'bootcamp', 'class', '3x', 'week', 'weather', 'kept', 'exercising', 'video', 'provided', 'good', 'workout', 'added', 'heavy', 'weights', 'make', 'more', 'challenging', 'definitely', 'would', 'recommend', 'beginners', 'intermediates', 'am', 'going', 'buy', '5', 'mile', 'give', 'mother', 'copy', 'one']",Leslie Sansone's Walk At Home: Walk Slim
1067411,ATM32EY27D0G0,B000OYCMMG,"T. Smith ""tls48025""","[46, 47]","I really enjoy Leslie Sansone dvds.  I like the Walk Slim 1&2 mile, but the 3 mile is a not for me.  In the 3 mile workout, the music, the walkers and the addition of new steps all over the place just left me feeling frantic instead of energized.  However, the 1&2 mile is classic but improved Leslie Sansone.  Just a heads up though, it is really one workout.  Specifically, the 1 mile chapter option just brings you into the already started 2 mile walk.  Now the 2 mile walk I really liked. I liked the music, the pace, the steps, the intervals, all of the walkers, her chatter, all of it.  The intervals are, of course, periods of higher intensity exercise followed by recovery exercise.  I really feel that the low impact version is the same as in her past videos - she just never called it out as such.  But there has often been periods of more intensity and then back to walking. The great thing is that it really isn't distracting to have some walkers do the high impact and others the low impact.  I only became a bit distracted for a very short instant during the third interval when 4 of 6 were doing high impact.On a side note, the DVDs I received wer mislabeled. The disc for the 3 mile really had the 1/2 mile on it and vice versa.  I am returning the discs to Amazon.  Maybe I will buy again at a brick store for easy return in case I get another one like this.  P.S. My favorite leslie Sansone are express 4 mile super challenge and WATP 3 mile fat burner.",3,"Love Leslie Sansone, but not the 3 mile on Walk Slim",1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,1471,"['really', 'enjoy', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'dvds', 'Walk', 'Slim', '1', '2', 'mile', '3', 'mile', 'not', '3', 'mile', 'workout', 'music', 'walkers', 'addition', 'new', 'steps', 'place', 'just', 'left', 'feeling', 'frantic', 'instead', 'energized', 'However', '1', '2', 'mile', 'classic', 'improved', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'Just', 'heads', 'up', 'really', 'one', 'workout', 'Specifically', '1', 'mile', 'chapter', 'option', 'just', 'already', 'started', '2', 'mile', 'walk', 'Now', '2', 'mile', 'walk', 'really', 'liked', 'liked', 'music', 'pace', 'steps', 'intervals', 'walkers', 'chatter', 'intervals', 'are', 'course', 'periods', 'higher', 'intensity', 'exercise', 'followed', 'recovery', 'exercise', 'really', 'feel', 'low', 'impact', 'version', 'same', 'past', 'videos', 'just', 'never', 'called', 'out', 'such', 'often', 'been', 'periods', 'more', 'intensity', 'then', 'back', 'walking', 'great', 'thing', 'really', ""n't"", 'distracting', 'have', 'walkers', 'do', 'high', 'impact', 'others', 'low', 'impact', 'only', 'became', 'bit', 'distracted', 'very', 'short', 'instant', 'third', 'interval', 'when', '4', '6', 'were', 'doing', 'high', 'impact.On', 'side', 'note', 'DVDs', 'received', 'wer', 'mislabeled', 'disc', '3', 'mile', 'really', 'had', '1/2', 'mile', 'vice', 'versa', 'am', 'returning', 'discs', 'Amazon', 'Maybe', 'will', 'buy', 'again', 'brick', 'store', 'easy', 'return', 'case', 'get', 'one', 'P.S', 'favorite', 'leslie', 'Sansone', 'are', 'express', '4', 'mile', 'super', 'challenge', 'WATP', '3', 'mile', 'fat', 'burner']",Leslie Sansone's Walk At Home: Walk Slim
