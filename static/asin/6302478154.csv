It's hard to watch the all-time bad, washed-out actors/actresses and try to appreciate the comedy, or the lack thereof, of Once Upon a Crime. I've never liked Sean Young (who stunk the film up like a dead cheese), the inevitable motor-mouth John Belushi, and Richard Lewis (why does he always flaps his arms around all the time? Is it because he sucks in acting? Or does he think that it makes for comedy?). Cybil Sheppard has no talent to speak of since the days of the The Last Picture Show, and all she did in that one was take off her clothes for her fifteen minutes of fame. The overtanned George Hamilton is clearly carrying the same shtick from Zorro, The Gay Blade. Giancarlo Giannini overdoes his subtlety. So, the only saving grace of the film is John Candy who had a couple of witty lines to work with. And that's about it. I did laugh, but it was out of pity. All in all, Snatch played the dog angle much, much better than Once Upon a Crime.",2,Bad...Really Bad.,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,1091,"['Viewed', '2/13Rate', '42/13', 'Talk', 'overacting', 'bad', 'acting', 'one', 'Just', 'everybody', 'cast', 'guilty', 'one', 'other', 'hard', 'watch', 'all-time', 'bad', 'washed-out', 'actors/actresses', 'try', 'appreciate', 'comedy', 'lack', 'thereof', 'Once', 'Crime', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'Sean', 'Young', 'who', 'stunk', 'film', 'up', 'dead', 'cheese', 'inevitable', 'motor-mouth', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Richard', 'Lewis', 'why', 'always', 'flaps', 'arms', 'time', 'acting', 'think', 'comedy', 'Cybil', 'Sheppard', 'talent', 'speak', 'days', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'did', 'one', 'was', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'fame', 'overtanned', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'clearly', 'carrying', 'same', 'shtick', 'Zorro', 'Gay', 'Blade', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'subtlety', 'So', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'John', 'Candy', 'who', 'had', 'couple', 'witty', 'lines', 'work', 'did', 'laugh', 'was', 'pity', 'Snatch', 'played', 'dog', 'angle', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'Once', 'Crime']",N/A

The film is silly, has a contrived plot, uses stereotypes, is littered with cliches, and that's just for starters.  Somehow, however, it makes you laugh a lot.  That's comedy for me because I enjoy laughing. Candy and Belushi made me laugh at their gambling addictions.  The French police made me laugh as they handled  their rich American quarry. The film begins as a mystery of sorts.  Forget about that end of the story. It is a comedy, not a mystery despite the hilarious suitcase full of body parts. Perhaps this hopelessly laughable movie is a new genre--mysterious comedy.",5,What is a comedy movie?,992217600,"06 11, 2001",2001,700,"['ONCE', 'A', 'CRIME', 'answered', 'question', 'quot', 'What', 'comedy', 'movie', 'quot', 'movie', 'film', 'silly', 'contrived', 'plot', 'stereotypes', 'littered', 'cliches', 'just', 'starters', 'Somehow', 'however', 'lot', 'comedy', 'enjoy', 'laughing', 'Candy', 'Belushi', 'made', 'laugh', 'gambling', 'addictions', 'French', 'police', 'made', 'handled', 'rich', 'American', 'quarry', 'film', 'mystery', 'sorts', 'Forget', 'end', 'story', 'comedy', 'not', 'mystery', 'hilarious', 'suitcase', 'full', 'body', 'parts', 'Perhaps', 'hopelessly', 'laughable', 'movie', 'new', 'genre', 'mysterious', 'comedy']",N/A
