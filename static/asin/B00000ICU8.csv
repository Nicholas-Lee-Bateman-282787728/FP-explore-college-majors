This was a favorite of mine growing up, and have seen it dozens of times.  My children had never watched it before, so it was the perfect opportunity to share with them a feel-good classic movie.  There's plenty of laughs, suspense, and action wrapped up in this little film about an extraterrestrial that crash lands on Earth.  No, it's not E.T.  In fact, this movie was filmed quite a few years before that strange alien invaded the silver screens.  This alien is....A cat.  With a spectacular collar that allows him to speak directly to the minds of humans, levitate objects, among other things.  His ship is in dire straits, broken parts and confiscated by the military.  That won't stop this cat from space from obtaining the gold he needs to fix his ship.  He reveals his otherworldly nature to a trio of humans, including one played by the always darling Sandy Duncan, and they do their best to help this furry feline repair his ship and make it back to space in time to meet up with others from his cat planet.  Things go astray and the ending is not what you would expect...**spoilers**...in a turn that puzzled both my children, Jake (as he is called) ends up staying on Earth.  He abandons his ship to save his new human friends (and potential earth cat love interest, Lucybelle).  This goes against nearly every other children's program that has been released in the past ten/twenty years, where the non Earthling always has to make it back home.  No matter what magical realm, place in time, or planet they came from, they always, always go back.  I think it's a refreshing turn that Jake cared for the people that went to such great lengths to assist him so much that he was willing to abandon his ship to bail them out of their danger.Another point in the film's favor is nearly the complete lack of pop references.  There's a bit of a basketball game shown, but nothing otherwise that is not understandable or that dates the film other than clothes and the technology (and maybe cat space ships would have technology like that, who knows?).  It's a refreshing change of pace from movies that blast pop songs and shove commercial logos in your face every few minutes.  That's what helps make this movie more timeless, while other films are so stamped there is no way to avoid mentally dating them.  There's very little violence (a few slapstick falls) and no cursing, so it's a clean movie as well.And why can't they make good, clean, all ages, fun movies like this these days?",5,Feline Fun for the Whole Family,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,2580,"['saw', 'available', 'rental', 'Amazon', 'instantly', 'had', 'watch', 'again', 'was', 'favorite', 'mine', 'growing', 'up', 'have', 'seen', 'times', 'children', 'had', 'never', 'watched', 'was', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'share', 'feel-good', 'classic', 'movie', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'suspense', 'action', 'wrapped', 'up', 'little', 'film', 'extraterrestrial', 'crash', 'lands', 'Earth', 'No', 'not', 'E.T', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'strange', 'alien', 'invaded', 'silver', 'screens', 'alien', '.A', 'cat', 'spectacular', 'collar', 'speak', 'directly', 'minds', 'humans', 'levitate', 'objects', 'other', 'things', 'ship', 'dire', 'straits', 'broken', 'parts', 'confiscated', 'military', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'cat', 'space', 'obtaining', 'gold', 'fix', 'ship', 'otherworldly', 'nature', 'trio', 'humans', 'including', 'one', 'played', 'always', 'darling', 'Sandy', 'Duncan', 'do', 'best', 'help', 'furry', 'feline', 'repair', 'ship', 'make', 'back', 'space', 'time', 'meet', 'up', 'others', 'cat', 'planet', 'Things', 'go', 'astray', 'ending', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'expect', '**spoilers**', 'turn', 'puzzled', 'children', 'Jake', 'called', 'up', 'staying', 'Earth', 'ship', 'save', 'new', 'human', 'friends', 'potential', 'earth', 'cat', 'love', 'interest', 'Lucybelle', 'nearly', 'other', 'children', 'program', 'been', 'released', 'past', 'ten/twenty', 'years', 'where', 'non', 'Earthling', 'always', 'make', 'back', 'home', 'matter', 'what', 'magical', 'realm', 'place', 'time', 'planet', 'came', 'always', 'always', 'go', 'back', 'think', 'refreshing', 'turn', 'Jake', 'cared', 'people', 'went', 'such', 'great', 'lengths', 'assist', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'willing', 'abandon', 'ship', 'bail', 'danger.Another', 'point', 'film', 'favor', 'nearly', 'complete', 'lack', 'pop', 'references', 'bit', 'basketball', 'game', 'shown', 'nothing', 'otherwise', 'not', 'understandable', 'film', 'other', 'clothes', 'technology', 'maybe', 'cat', 'space', 'ships', 'would', 'have', 'technology', 'who', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'movies', 'blast', 'pop', 'songs', 'shove', 'commercial', 'logos', 'face', 'few', 'minutes', 'what', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'timeless', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'stamped', 'way', 'avoid', 'mentally', 'dating', 'very', 'little', 'violence', 'few', 'slapstick', 'falls', 'cursing', 'clean', 'movie', 'well.And', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'clean', 'ages', 'fun', 'movies', 'days']",N/A

Being a huge fan of movies and remembering good ones such as this, scenes would drift in and out often - particularly the part when Jake and the odd scientist meet - that scene stuck in there like glue. Fuzzy, but still there.Fast forward 25 years, and the movie is just as good and memorable as when I'd first watched it. Going through the scenes that I'd remembered and actually seeing them again, was like the first time any kid interested in movies like this would be at 8 - mesmerized. Honestly I could not help but be glued to the television the entire time. As more scenes went by, jogging my memory - the more I'd come to realize that Disney truly made a classic movie that I truly enjoyed. What's unfortunate is that hardly anybody seems to have seen it (least anyone I've told).Nevertheless, the movie was amazing. Ending scene was a bit long, I know I know - what a small gripe. It isn't to say that it was bad, just a bit too long. I still love it though. Guess getting older you get more into critique mode than when you were 8. LolI'd recommend this product to anyone really. It's a family movie and is totally enjoyable really at any age. I'm half tempted to take it to my baby brothers to have them watch, but since it has live actors and not cartoons, I'm not sure they'd be able to hold in the ability to watch it and would probably rage out at me to put in a Disney Pixar film (which are incredible themselves, they've got good taste) - but something about these movies that caught my attention much like most Disney films, are what make them magical.",5,Great movie as a kid.

The pilot, christened ""Jake"" by the first human he contacts, is a member of a sapient race of felines who, instead of evolving ""an upright position, hands, tools, and chronic pain in the lower back,"" learned to use their mental powers to manipulate their environment, then developed technology to amplify and direct those powers--in Jake's case, a crystal collar.  His scoutcraft is in need of repair, or he'll be stranded on Earth for life when his mothership goes home.  Allying himself with an unorthodox young scientist named Frank (Ken Berry), he sets out to acquire the element (gold) that's required to get his ship functional again.  But his landing was witnessed, and the U.S. Army, specifically Gen. Stilton (Harry Morgan), is convinced that he's the spearhead for a planned invasion (""some slimy, green-headed, 12-legged monster may be creeping into the White House even as we speak"").  Meanwhile Jake and Frank, along with one of Frank's colleagues, Link (McLean Stevenson), a compulsive gambler on just about anything, including every sport in existence, and his would-be girlfriend Liz (Sandy Duncan), are trying to gather the gold and get the ship repaired.  What they don't know is that not only is the Army after them, but their employer has a rival who's planted an industrial spy (Roddy McDowall) in its midst--and both of them want to possess the secret of the power source that drives Jake's ship.

When I saw it was available on DVD, I quickly purchased it to have it for my family so my 3 year old daughter can have it for when she is old enough to enjoy the humor.  That won't be long as the movie is simply infectious and has humor for all ages.The plot is simple.  An alien cat with a most unusal collar, named Zunar J5 Zoric 9/49, but whom everyone just calls ""Jake"" has made an emergency landing on Earth for repairs.  He has only a limited amount of time to fix his spaceship before his rendevous with the mothership, that he calls ""Mother"", otherwise he will be stranded on Earth for years. I used to think he was from Mars, but actually his home planet is never identified.Jake spends his time after arriving with a terrific comedic cast including two from M*A*S*H (Harry Morgan as a gruff General and MacLean Stevenson as a compusive gambler friend), as well as Ken Berry (you've got to see ""The Ugly Daschund"" if you love this movie!), Sandy Duncan, and Roddy McDowell in some of the craziest misadventures you'll ever witness.  A timeless story that you won't be embarrassed to watch with your kids or grandparents.In the film, it seems at first quite easy to repair his spaceship, until Jake realizes that he needs quite a lot of what is fairly common on his planet to fix it - gold!  About $120,000 worth!!  The rest of the film involves twists and turns about Harry Morgan as the general, trying to discover who the alien is, and the various ways Jake and his friends try to raise the capital in such a short time without raising suspitions.  There is also a spy who is out to foil their plans as a subplot and that just goes to throw everything into a tizzy.  There is even a quite suspenseful chase-scene!Overall, this is film is great fun with really timeless humor.  You can watch it again and again.

503250,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00000ICU8,Einsatz,"[0, 4]","An earnest Disney flick that's innocuous at best (something children will probably enjoy though).  The best performance in the film was the cat's (how they managed to get him to respond like that is a testimony to the trainers).  The story isn't much of a strain: cat crashes, cat needs to repair his space ship, ship is commandeered by the military, gold is needed for the spare part, bad guys want the cat's collar......  It's resolved pretty much as you'd expect.  The only questionably aspect was the betting angle and rigging games to get the money required to buy the gold.  I suppose that was easier than actually panning for it.Despite the insistence by others, I didn't see much of a comparison to E.T. (but for levitating a motorcycle over a fence).  Yes, the military was involved in both films but really, aren't the military always involved in these types of films?  They're usually the first on scene for monsters and aliens.For me it was a tad bit silly and not funny enough.

His home planet is never identified, but they must have some beautiful felines there if this talented extraterrestrial abyssinian is their  ambassador.Actually, Jake just comes to Earth because of maintenance  problems on his space-going scout ship.  After arriving, he teams up with a  superb comic cast, including Ken Berry, Sandy Duncan, MacLean Stevenson,  Harry Morgan and Roddy McDowell for some of the zaniest adventures you or  your children will ever enjoy.  Just for good measure, Jake brings along  the most unique flea collar ever made, and therein lies most of the  story.Jake only needs a small amount of a fairly common substance (on  his planet) to repair his ship.  Unfortunately, that common substance turns  out to be about $120,000 worth of gold.  Needing that kind of material help  in a short period of time provides the vehicle for a madcap comedy.The  Cat from Outer Space isn't a classic, but it's close, and it's wonderful  entertainment that you can be comfortable letting your children watch  without supervision.
