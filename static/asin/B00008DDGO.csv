738226,A6GMEO3VRY51S,B00008DDGO,microjoe,"[2, 2]","Greatest Heroes in an interesting series of animated programs, all include an introduction by Charlton Heston on the story we are about to see. The animation is good quality, full hand drawn 2D cel animation without shortcuts. In the middle of each episode in this series, they usually have a cutaway of another story from the bible, done in computer animation to contrast the two stories.We bought this story, Daniel and the Lions Den, and the Story of Jonah. Jonah is my favorite, but this was good.All versions of animated and live action stray from the source material and are not accurate, just like non-biblical movies are not accurate to the book they are based on. It is more of an issue in a biblical story as we all worry about people getting their facts wrong, but it is hard to avoid. Film makers balance what will make a story flow for the viewer, especially kids. In this ""Greatest Heroes"" version, most of the main characters are very young, perhaps to relate to kids more. But they are appealing characters that draw the kids in.  This episode has great moral lessons, and if you have issues about the changes from scripture, always discuss the differences afterwords to your kids as we did. No extras on the DVD, sound and picture quality were good, no problems with playing the disc or the menu. I recommend buying this DVD.",5,Enjoyed this with the kids,1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,1342,"['Greatest', 'Heroes', 'interesting', 'series', 'animated', 'programs', 'include', 'introduction', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'story', 'are', 'see', 'animation', 'good', 'quality', 'full', 'hand', 'drawn', '2D', 'cel', 'animation', 'shortcuts', 'middle', 'episode', 'series', 'usually', 'have', 'cutaway', 'story', 'bible', 'done', 'computer', 'animation', 'contrast', 'two', 'stories.We', 'bought', 'story', 'Daniel', 'Lions', 'Den', 'Story', 'Jonah', 'Jonah', 'favorite', 'was', 'good.All', 'versions', 'animated', 'live', 'action', 'stray', 'source', 'material', 'are', 'not', 'accurate', 'just', 'non-biblical', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'accurate', 'book', 'are', 'based', 'more', 'issue', 'biblical', 'story', 'worry', 'people', 'getting', 'facts', 'wrong', 'hard', 'avoid', 'Film', 'makers', 'balance', 'what', 'will', 'make', 'story', 'flow', 'viewer', 'especially', 'kids', 'Greatest', 'Heroes', 'version', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'young', 'perhaps', 'relate', 'kids', 'more', 'are', 'appealing', 'characters', 'draw', 'kids', 'episode', 'great', 'moral', 'lessons', 'have', 'issues', 'changes', 'scripture', 'always', 'discuss', 'differences', 'afterwords', 'kids', 'did', 'extras', 'DVD', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'were', 'good', 'problems', 'playing', 'disc', 'menu', 'recommend', 'buying', 'DVD']",N/A
