565716,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000053VB1,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I want to say that I had no idea what this movie was about when I started watching it.  I knew that it starred Michelle Pfeiffer and that it was called `Love Field' and despite living in Dallas I didn't make that connection and instead thought this was some period piece interracial love story movie.  It is, sort of, but not in the sense of what I was envisioning.`Love Field' tells the story of unstable housewife Lurene Hallett who is a tad simple minded, married to a man who puts up with her more than loves her and has a strange connection to Jackie Kennedy.  In fact, in the film's opening scenes we see her bounded to touch the skin of the woman and then completely crushed when her moment passes.  After the president is murdered, Lurene is intent on supporting Jackie O. at the funeral, but her husband opposes (I mean, he's being sensible but we're beyond that point by now) and so she defies him and runs off.  On her bus en-route to northern states she meets a mysterious black man named Paul who is traveling with his daughter.  Due to her own meddling and misunderstanding, she is soon on the run with this man and his child as they are being tracked down by police and by Lurene's husband.  Due to the nature of the south, there isn't much sympathy for a crazed white woman in the company of a black man, but Lurene doesn't understand all that.  In her mind, everything is fine.`Love Field' touches on some very controversial history, with regard to racism in particular, but I felt as if the depiction of Lurene was a little too gimmicky.  The script basically used her to make a point, and by doing that they made her less of a character and more of a symbol, which didn't always work to the advantage of the film.  Still, Pfeiffer is really good here and Dennis Haysbert is excellent (when is he not?) and so it is worth seeing for the two of them.  It's predictable and a little too obvious in parts, but it is engaging enough to be worthy of a gander.",3,Song of the south...,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,1972,"['want', 'say', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'knew', 'starred', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'was', 'called', 'Love', 'Field', 'living', 'Dallas', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'connection', 'instead', 'thought', 'was', 'period', 'interracial', 'love', 'story', 'movie', 'sort', 'not', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'envisioning.', 'Love', 'Field', 'story', 'unstable', 'housewife', 'Lurene', 'Hallett', 'who', 'tad', 'simple', 'minded', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'up', 'more', 'strange', 'connection', 'Jackie', 'Kennedy', 'fact', 'film', 'opening', 'see', 'bounded', 'touch', 'skin', 'woman', 'then', 'completely', 'crushed', 'when', 'moment', 'passes', 'president', 'murdered', 'Lurene', 'intent', 'supporting', 'Jackie', 'O.', 'funeral', 'husband', 'mean', 'being', 'sensible', ""'re"", 'point', 'now', 'so', 'runs', 'off', 'bus', 'en-route', 'northern', 'states', 'mysterious', 'black', 'man', 'named', 'Paul', 'who', 'traveling', 'daughter', 'Due', 'own', 'meddling', 'misunderstanding', 'soon', 'run', 'man', 'child', 'are', 'being', 'tracked', 'down', 'police', 'Lurene', 'husband', 'Due', 'nature', 'south', ""n't"", 'much', 'sympathy', 'crazed', 'white', 'woman', 'company', 'black', 'man', 'Lurene', ""n't"", 'understand', 'mind', 'everything', 'fine.', 'Love', 'Field', 'touches', 'very', 'controversial', 'history', 'regard', 'racism', 'particular', 'felt', 'depiction', 'Lurene', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'gimmicky', 'script', 'basically', 'used', 'make', 'point', 'doing', 'made', 'less', 'character', 'more', 'symbol', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'advantage', 'film', 'Still', 'Pfeiffer', 'really', 'good', 'here', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'excellent', 'when', 'not', 'worth', 'seeing', 'two', 'predictable', 'little', 'too', 'obvious', 'parts', 'engaging', 'enough', 'be', 'worthy', 'gander']",N/A

565718,AH1M9A3JTV7C3,B000053VB1,Ian Muldoon,"[13, 14]","Call me sentimental, I don't care, but I loved this film. Although it deals with America's cancer - racism- as well as any I can recall, it does so in a way that should touch the human in any civilized human.  There have been hundreds of films with racism at their heart, PINKY, THE DEFIANT ONES, THE COLOR PURPLE, MISSISSIPPI BURNING, THE SEARCHERS etc, etc but LOVE FIELD is up with the best and this is due mainly to the masterly direction of Mr Kaplan.  But to cite racism as its raison d'etre is to miss the fact that it has a compelling narrative, the story of a journey - on a bus, in a series of vintage sixties automobiles which cruise through the poverty stricken back counties of the black South, and on foot - and an internal journey in the heart and mind of its three main characters, a black man, and his five year old daughter, and a VERY white white woman. There are at least two laugh out loud moments one featuring the gorgeous Ms Pfeiffer who, when caught short in the countryside, is about to defecate on a map of Virginia when she realises they are very near the goal of HER journey, Arlington Cemetery and JFK's funeral, and she stumbles up shouting with her knickers literally in a twist around her ankles. Unless you have a heart of stone, you will also shed some tears over this film - for its characters, for good American people, for the hopes of a potentially great country, and the failure of the American dream. The huge cars symbolise so  much - and when our heroes drive off in one, it clunks along at no more than 40 because it is damaged goods, just as the society is which judges and weighs worth on the basis of  colour.  To me this is Ms Pfeiffer's greatest role and one of the finest I have seen of an American actor.  Mr Haysbert is brilliant. A great American film.

I liked it from the beginning, due to the wonderful performance of Michelle Pfeiffer, as Lurene, a ditzy Texas blond in the 60's.  She worships the Kennedys, has a scrapbook of their photos, and makes clothes after the patterns that Jackie wears.  She'd seem silly except that she has a heart of gold and is very likeable.She is, of course, crushed when JFK is killed while visiting Dallas, her home, and decides to override the objections of her redneck husband and takes the Greyhound to DC to attend the funeral.  On the bus she encounters a quiet Black man, beautifully played by Dennis Haysbert, who's travelling with a small girl who doesn't speak.  Lurene isn't shy and she intrudes herself into the lives of these two, in spite of the efforts of the Black man to keep her out.What follows is a surprising series of events that keep the three entertwined, in spite of racial prejudice, the FBI and Lurene's husband.It's a relatively simple film but the story is good and all of the performances are excellent.
