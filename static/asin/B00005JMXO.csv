I think this movie is just almost perfect. The twins are great actress, I mean, they can't can't be bad actresses after all of those years they have involved in acting.I have never really watched their movies or T.V. shows, because before I thought they were just girls who wanted to cool and doesn't know how to act. But I was wrong. After watching this movie when it first came out on DVD, I realized that this two girls knows what they are doing. They are really professional, and their acting doesn't have any links that allows the audience to say, ""That is so fake."" I don't know if they improved over the years or something, since the only media I saw them in is in ""Full House"" which, they are still infants, or toddlers. But this movie deeply impressed me.Although I cannot say that this is the best teen movie made in 2004, but I can say that this movie is one of the best teen movie that is made in the 2004, but I guess that this movie is one of the best I saw this year...teen movie, excuse me.The story in this movie is sort of perfect, but I thought that they can add in a bit more in it. It is about Jane (Ashley) and Roxy (Mary-Kate) Ryan, in which they are twins, but have really different personalities. Jane is all, organized, professional, and mature, after suffering the death of their mother. Roxy is a rock-star, and her room is just a mess. Living together is just a disaster; they don't get along with each other, because all Jane do is critize Roxy on how she should do better at school and to clean up her mess also to become more mature. So, on the day in which Jane has to go to New York City to present ""the most important speech"" of her life for college, Roxy decided to ditch school and crash into a Simple Plan concert, also in New York. So there they go, all the way to New York when on their trail is Lomax (Levy), a men who's been on the trail of Roxy for years because of the ""crime"" she committed. Also, when they arrived, someone accidently slipped a ""chip"" on one of the twin's purse, in which they have to get it back. So now, they are being chased by two guys...one after Roxy, and the other after Jane. Throughout the chase, it has some hilorious scenes, and little romances that seems to crash their way. While the twins are trying to make it to the concert and speech, they discovered that having each other is the best of all.It's a gotta see!",5,....fabulous...,1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,2503,"[""n't"", 'movie', 'suppose', 'be', 'one', 'big', 'theaterical', 'hits', 'Olsen', 'twins', 'Well', 'really', 'think', 'movie', 'just', 'almost', 'perfect', 'twins', 'are', 'great', 'actress', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'actresses', 'years', 'have', 'involved', 'acting.I', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'watched', 'movies', 'T.V', 'shows', 'thought', 'were', 'just', 'girls', 'who', 'wanted', 'cool', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'act', 'was', 'wrong', 'watching', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'realized', 'two', 'girls', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'are', 'really', 'professional', 'acting', ""n't"", 'have', 'links', 'audience', 'say', 'so', 'fake', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'improved', 'years', 'something', 'only', 'media', 'saw', 'Full', 'House', 'are', 'still', 'infants', 'toddlers', 'movie', 'deeply', 'impressed', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'best', 'teen', 'movie', 'made', '2004', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'teen', 'movie', 'made', '2004', 'guess', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'saw', 'year', 'teen', 'movie', 'excuse', 'me.The', 'story', 'movie', 'sort', 'perfect', 'thought', 'can', 'add', 'bit', 'more', 'Jane', 'Ashley', 'Roxy', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ryan', 'are', 'twins', 'have', 'really', 'different', 'personalities', 'Jane', 'organized', 'professional', 'mature', 'suffering', 'death', 'mother', 'Roxy', 'rock-star', 'room', 'just', 'mess', 'Living', 'together', 'just', 'disaster', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'other', 'Jane', 'do', 'critize', 'Roxy', 'how', 'should', 'do', 'better', 'school', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'also', 'become', 'more', 'mature', 'So', 'day', 'Jane', 'go', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'present', 'most', 'important', 'speech', 'life', 'college', 'Roxy', 'decided', 'ditch', 'school', 'crash', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'concert', 'also', 'New', 'York', 'there', 'go', 'way', 'New', 'York', 'when', 'trail', 'Lomax', 'Levy', 'men', 'who', 'been', 'trail', 'Roxy', 'years', 'crime', 'committed', 'Also', 'when', 'arrived', 'someone', 'accidently', 'slipped', 'chip', 'one', 'twin', 'purse', 'have', 'get', 'back', 'So', 'now', 'are', 'being', 'chased', 'two', 'guys', 'one', 'Roxy', 'other', 'Jane', 'chase', 'hilorious', 'scenes', 'little', 'romances', 'crash', 'way', 'twins', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'concert', 'speech', 'discovered', 'having', 'other', 'best', 'all.It', 'got', 'ta', 'see']",New York Minute

I doubt anyone who puts them down could do any better.  They did that scene with so much emotion, it seemed like they were really feeling what they said.  Also, HOW could you not say it's funny?  Do you lack a sense of humor?  There were lots of funny parts.  The old couple were hilarious!  Eugene Levy was funny as ever in this movie!!!  I'm actually glad Mary-Kate & Ashley are as rich as they are.  The jealousy in the Olsen haters is funnier than any comedy I've ever seen.  :oD(...):  I just saw 'New York Minute' tonight - on its first day in theaters.  I must say it's definitely worth watching.  I was absolutely amazed at how far their acting abilities have come.  This is a prime example of how a big production can bring out the best in an actor/actress.  I'm SO GLAD they threw in a sad scene toward the end.  Mary-Kate & Ashley are excellent in serious scenes.  If anyone doesn't believe this statement, watch it for yourself.  I found myself speechless in the street scene before they went their separate ways.  There are plenty of funny moments which kept the audience laughing.  Every actor played a prime role in the comedy, and the action was pretty intense at times.  Bob Saget had a small cameo where he gave a puzzled look on the street as he watched them run around in towels.

The Olsens are their normal bubbly selves and the humor and quick wit, if I may, is present butthe plot is extremely ill-concieved but this movie is made for 13 year old girls so there is not much else to say. I am a guy, right, so when my sister bought this on DVD I first wanted to puke, because why would you want to spend your money on that, but in the comercial they end up running around just wearing towels so I thought I would watch it with her, and I was very skeptical because I watched many a Olsen Twin adventure babysitting her. But I was pleased because this movie has its charm and if you asked anyone else to make this movie besides the Olsen Twins they could not pull it off. In the end this is a Olsen twin classic and anyone who is a fan enjoy it and have fun but anyone else will probably feel their brains turning to mush.

623152,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,B00005JMXO,Crystal Starr Light,"[2, 2]","I really have no idea why I actually sat through this movie.  I knew from the onset that it was no award-winning show or had anything of substance.  The trailer pretty much gave away how cheesy this was.  And the entire premise was absurd.  But watch it I did.  The best thing I can say about that experience is that I can write a truthful review.Okay, the premise of the movie is pretty standard: twin A (Jane) is the goody-too-shoes, does well in school, and is trying out for a scholarship to Oxford University.  Twin B (Roxy) is rebellious, always skipping school, and a punk rocker.  (Dad is non-existent and/or oblivious.)  As Roxy is taking Jane to New York City for Jane's big speech to win the Scholarship (which is the first time I've ever heard of anything like this), a data chip with pirated music is placed in Roxy's bag.  Fake Chinese guy then tries to take it back.  All the while, Roxy is trying to evade the truant officer that has been tracking her since forever.  The girls run around New York in all sorts of dress or undress, meet two cute guys that become their boyfriends within the 1 hour and 30 minute run time (4 hours movie time), get to crash a hotel, and other absurd activities.  And at the end, Jane and Roxy have a girl breakout because each feels overshadowed by the other.As if this plot doesn't sound appealing enough, you get treated to other stupidities.  Both bad guys (truant officer played by Eugene Levy and fake Chinese guy) are incredibly stupid and remind you of someone out of a bad Disney movie.  The boyfriends are introduced so rapidly with no chemistry between them and their prospective girlfriends.  As I watched each ""boyfriend"" get forced into a scene, I sunk lower in my seat.  I didn't like the sexual connotations imbued in the movie (the girls racing around in their bathrobes, ""bumping"" into boys, and so forth).  The ending is so hokey I wanted to groan (and wish someone would do movie magic in my life).  And where is the Dad in all this?  After a brief mention of him seeing his girls bodysurfing, he disappears, never to be seen again.I will admit that there were three good aspects of this movie.  The first was a humorous scene where fake Chinese guy calls the twins and demands the chip in exchange for Jane's date planner.  The second is how the twins eventually realize that they love each other and need to spend more time with each other.  And the last was a cameo appearance from another father...Overall: don't make my mistake and think their is anything substantial/fun/entertaining in this movie.  Just avoid.Brought to you by*C.S.

623153,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JMXO,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 4]","New York Minute is a pretty darn entertaining film featuring a number of humorous moments, and I'm not just saying that because Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen are drop-dead gorgeous.  They are, of course, drop-dead gorgeous, and I admit I only watched this film because of them, but this light comedy proved to be an enjoyable experience in its own right.  The plot is rather formulaic and predictable, but it does work, and the Olsen twins really shine throughout the whole thing.You start out with two sisters (imagine that!) who could not be more different: Jane (Ashley Olsen) is a budding, super-organized genius vying for a prestigious scholarship to Oxford; Roxy (Mary-Kate Olsen) is a bit of a wild child rebel who goes to great lengths to avoid school.  Naturally, the girls do not get along very well.  On this particular day, Jane is on her way to give the speech she hopes will win her the scholarship, and Roxy is playing hooky in order to attend a video shoot and slip her band's demo into the hands of someone in the music business.  Things start going wrong from the very start.  Forced to make their way into town by themselves, the girls manage to get themselves involved in a piracy ring, lose their clothes, take on the company of a little dog so ugly he's cute, find themselves on the ledge of a high-rise building, wander the streets of New York City wearing nothing but towels (thank you, writers), evade the clutches of a truant officer with illusions of grandeur, cross paths with Full House dad Bob Sagett (in a quick cameo), model all sorts of funky clothes and hairstyles, race to get Jane to her speech location on time, and eventually - and most importantly - reforge their long-lost bond of sisterhood.New York Minute isn't Oscar caliber material, but it's a good, funny movie with lots of twists and turns and an overall positive message.  That's a whole lot more than most of today's films have to offer.  For me, it does seem like a good transition film for the Olsen twins as they evolve from childhood actresses to young adult actresses.  It's hard to break a mold that was formed while the girls were still in diapers.  While the Olsens may not be ready for truly adult roles just yet (they are, after all, still teenagers), they clearly show the talent to reconstitute themselves as bona fide actresses - singly or together.  Whatever limitations New York Minute displays are due to the script and not to Ashley or Mary-Kate.  People seemed to expect too much from this movie, treating it as a make-or-break moment in the Olsens' careers, it's unfortunate that this film was not more successful at the box office, but that does not mean that New York Minute is not a good movie - because it is.

As someone who managed to miss all of the previous efforts by the twins it wasn't an attempt to capture any nostaligic feeling. It wasn't also based on anything related to the story - teens get mixed up in series of mishaps in big city has been done many times before, such as Elizabeth Shue's ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING. You know what I think it was, most possibly a clip of two totally hot looking blonde actresses (let's face it they are) and the chemistry and comic timing they seem to have together.No, high-class art NEW YORK MINUTE is not. It's not the funniest movie out either. But what is lacks in what some perceive as it flaws it makes up for with good natured fun. Yes, this is a fun movie. It's fun to see the two go from one misadventure to another initially with a mutual contempt that becomes a realization on the importance of family and family ties.The movie features Jane Ryan (Ashley Olsen), a straight-A uptight Long island high school student who organizes her entire life around her day planner. She's driven and ambitious and determined to win a scholarship to go study at Oxford in England. She has her speech/pitch ready to be delivered in New York and seems as preapred as anyone could be. But fate has a cruel twist in store for her. Enter her sister Roxy (played by Mary-Kate Olsen), she's about as different from Jane as possible. Roxy is with a rock-band and acts with spontaneity that Jane would find scary. She also has made a habit of playing truant, something that has brought her to the attantion of Nassau Co. truancy officer Max Lomax (played by comic genius Eugene Levy.)Roxy is tasked with getting her sister to the train station, but she has her own plans for the big city, determined to deliver some demo tapes to record producers on hand for the videotaping of a new rock video. So, the two head for the big city with the bumbling Lomax in hot pursuit. Through some crazy machinations they become entangled up with some music and video pirates (including the hilarious Andy Richter as a goon who thinks he is Chinese) and the son of a U.S. Senator (and her dog) and are soon running through the streets of New York City in little more than bath towels.I've read a lot of reviewers on her dissing the acting of Ashley and Mary-Kate. Well, it's true that they are not going to be winning any Oscars for their roles here, but they deliver their performances with an infectious enthusiasm that had be lapping up every minute of the movie. I enjoyed it, I simply could not help myself.This movie comes recommended, and I really didn't think it would be. I surprised myself by enjoying every zany moment of it. And those girls are too cute!",4,I could not help myself from enjoying this movie - a total surprise,1148083200,"05 20, 2006",2006,2768,"['Something', 'must', 'have', 'appealed', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'MINUTE', 'add', 'TiVo', 'list', 'someone', 'who', 'managed', 'miss', 'previous', 'efforts', 'twins', 'was', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'capture', 'nostaligic', 'feeling', 'was', ""n't"", 'also', 'based', 'anything', 'related', 'story', 'teens', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'series', 'mishaps', 'big', 'city', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'such', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'ADVENTURES', 'IN', 'BABYSITTING', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'was', 'most', 'possibly', 'clip', 'two', 'totally', 'hot', 'looking', 'blonde', 'actresses', 'let', 'face', 'are', 'chemistry', 'comic', 'timing', 'seem', 'have', 'together.No', 'high-class', 'art', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'MINUTE', 'not', 'not', 'funniest', 'movie', 'either', 'what', 'lacks', 'what', 'perceive', 'up', 'good', 'natured', 'fun', 'Yes', 'fun', 'movie', 'fun', 'see', 'two', 'go', 'one', 'misadventure', 'initially', 'mutual', 'contempt', 'realization', 'importance', 'family', 'family', 'ties.The', 'movie', 'Jane', 'Ryan', 'Ashley', 'Olsen', 'straight-A', 'uptight', 'Long', 'island', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'entire', 'life', 'day', 'planner', 'driven', 'ambitious', 'determined', 'win', 'scholarship', 'go', 'study', 'Oxford', 'England', 'speech/pitch', 'ready', 'be', 'delivered', 'New', 'York', 'as', 'preapred', 'anyone', 'could', 'be', 'fate', 'cruel', 'twist', 'store', 'Enter', 'sister', 'Roxy', 'played', 'Mary-Kate', 'Olsen', 'about', 'as', 'different', 'Jane', 'possible', 'Roxy', 'rock-band', 'acts', 'spontaneity', 'Jane', 'would', 'find', 'scary', 'also', 'made', 'habit', 'playing', 'truant', 'something', 'brought', 'attantion', 'Nassau', 'Co.', 'truancy', 'officer', 'Max', 'Lomax', 'played', 'comic', 'genius', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Roxy', 'tasked', 'getting', 'sister', 'train', 'station', 'own', 'plans', 'big', 'city', 'determined', 'deliver', 'demo', 'tapes', 'record', 'producers', 'hand', 'videotaping', 'new', 'rock', 'video', 'So', 'two', 'head', 'big', 'city', 'bumbling', 'Lomax', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'crazy', 'machinations', 'become', 'entangled', 'up', 'music', 'video', 'pirates', 'including', 'hilarious', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'goon', 'who', 'Chinese', 'son', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'dog', 'are', 'soon', 'running', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'little', 'more', 'bath', 'towels.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'dissing', 'acting', 'Ashley', 'Mary-Kate', 'Well', 'true', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'winning', 'Oscars', 'roles', 'here', 'deliver', 'performances', 'infectious', 'enthusiasm', 'had', 'be', 'lapping', 'up', 'minute', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'myself.This', 'movie', 'recommended', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'surprised', 'enjoying', 'zany', 'moment', 'girls', 'are', 'too', 'cute']",New York Minute

623156,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00005JMXO,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[1, 1]","The Olsen Twins are at it again, making a movie that's a knock-off of another movie.  They ripped off""How The West Was Won""and""The Parent Trap"", and now in this movie, they rip off ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"".  Only the premise, that is, not the charm, the dialogue, the comedy, and the stellar music, because they would've made ""New York Minute"" more tolerate than it is.  It's an unbearable 90 minutes of clamored Olsen fanservice, twins who can do whatever they want and get away with it because they got production backings. I'm sure for the hardcore fans, that would be a treat, but there's little-to-nothing for non-fans to stay tuned; by 'little', I refer to the inclusion of Jared Padalecki from ""Supernatural"".I find it amusingly ironic that the so-called tomboy of the twins (Mary-Kate) will be the one with an eating disorder.  Shouldn't it be the pampered one with that disorder?  But I won't hold such a personal crisis against this film, since there are other legitimate problems I can throw at.  Primarily, how the jokes seemed to be taken from the book of vintage slapstick, and how easy and dated they really are: from the gag where the twins are throwing a dog at each other until they mistakenly throw it out the window to a parent figure not noticing that the daughters are on TV when they should be in school (and yet when they watched the TV, it aired a different scene), along with the pratfalls and the old 'look over there' tricks; the tired jokes are even worse when The Twins FORCED to make the jokes happen, like when one of them tried to grab a slushie from someone and eventually spoiled some on the other twin's dress.  Sadly, they seem to be the wisest characters of the movie, as everyone got hit by the brick of stupid; the villains are pathetic, one of them is literally a Caucasian with a Chinese accent (that takes racist stereotypes to a whole new level). And the twins happen to come across no-dimensional dreamboats that have no thought or reason for those guys with them other than being trophy meatbags.""New York Minute"" is superficial at its heinous.

Jane is a straightlaced, Oxford-bound student and good girl, while Roxy is a wild rock chick. However, these not-so-loving sisters end up on the lam through NYC, with a bumbling truant officer (Eugene Levy) on their trail.Things get even hairier when they get enmeshed in a black market scheme involving a computer chip they find in some food. Then a senator's dog eats the chip (woo! We've got Shakespearean complexity here!), and the girls are accused of dognapping it. So of course, they have to thwart the forces of evil and grow closer together in the process.Perhaps the most annoying thing about &quot;New York Minute&quot; is that it boldly goes nowhere new. The idea of identical twins who have opposing personalities -- it's been done before. In fact, it's been done by these same twins. Ditto with the dead mom. And mistaking one girl for another? Sadly, it's the closest thing there is to a plot twist. (Not to mention the laughable threat of a convent school for Roxy)The script is full of cliches and aged visual gags (ripping a skirt to a miniskirt) that try to cover up the Iceland-sized plot holes. Andy Richter's cliched role is a monstrosity, and the closest thing we have to character development is the two sisters talking about... well, sisterhood and togetherness and all that drivel.The Olsen twins really haven't gained any acting ability since their &quot;Full House&quot; days; they are not convincing either as brainiacs or rockers. The way they express any strong emotion is still to let their mouths drop open, and their eyes goggle. It was mildly cute when they were little, but in a pair of high school seniors it looks like brain damage.

Jane is more focused on her schoolwork and getting into a good collage, while Roxy is cutting school every day to see music video shoots, and being chased by Max Lomax, who she has been eluding for years. The two don't get along, but they end up taking the train together to get to different destinations, Jane going to a speech for a collage, and Roxy going to give her bands CD to someone else. The two get kicked off a train, and then a man plants a microchip into Roxy's bag, which wants to be found by Bennie Bang. Bennie works for the movie pirates, and needs to get the chip back for his foster mother. Bennie steals Jane's day by day planner, which contains everything that must be done (Oh no!) and with the help of Trey, who is the adult son of a State Senator, they try to get to where they both have to go, while Max Lomax is hot on their trails.To tell the truth, I hate the Olsen twins.

If they're the ""so-bad-they're-good"" variety, all the better.  I've had the pleasure of watching such bombs as ""Battlefield Earth,"" ""Gigli,"" ""Kangaroo Jack,"" but in all honesty, they pale in comparison to ""New York Minute.""  Now I know this movie wasn't set up with a 34 year old adult in mind, but even my six year old asked to leave half way through because ""it's stupid.""Oh, where to begin to sort out this mess of a movie?  Okay, here's the gist: Jane and Roxy are two twin sisters that couldn't be more different.  Jane is the studious one (plain Jane, get it?), and Roxy is the wild, sloppy, out of control one who is also the drummer in a rock band.  Jane is participating in a speech competition at Columbia University, hoping to win a scholarship at Oxford in England.Eugene Levy's talent is totally wasted as the hapless Max Lomax, a truant officer bent on capturing the ever absent Roxy. Think of ""Ferris Bueller's Day off"" without the charm, wit, or spark of originality and you have the gist of this ""sub-plot.""  Max pursues Roxy, mistakes Jane for Roxy, and ""fun"" ensues.Andy Richter agreed to star in this mess as a Chinese Mobster named Benny pursuing Jane because a microchip was slipped into her purse.  Andy Richter's not Chinese...so hmmm...okay...  This microchip, by the way, is pretty darn big, yet it is eaten by the twins' dog.  Benny pursues Jane, mistakes Roxy for Jane, and ""fun"" ensues.  Benny steals Jane's planner and holds it for ransom until the dog passes the microchip.Sadly, Hollywood still cranks this stuff hoping by some fluke it appeals to the general public and makes money.  And yes, there will be parents who will take their daughters to this expecting the same direct-to-video fun they've come to expect from the Olsen twins.

I was a little hesitant to see this movie. While most of their videos in their straight to DVD series have been entertaining they haven't been that great. But I do enjoy the girls, and I was curious so I went. Well folks, I was very very surprised at how funny this movie was.The basic plot revolves around Roxy and Jane Ryan - twin sisters that have grown apart since the death of their mother. Through a series of often funny events they are forced to spend the day together. We join them on a journey to get Roxy to a Simple Plan video shoot and Jane to her speech for college at Oxford. Through the day they meet Chinese ""mobsters"" (Andy Richter - so funny), a man they insist on terrorizing, a dog that eats a chip, and of course the cute boys.The dialogue is funny and fast paced, keeping the movie moving forward and not giving the audience a chance to get bored. Adding to the enjoyablity of the movie is the fact that the girls are becoming very talented actresses - they deliver the lines perfectly. There is a scene where the girls confront each other about their issues with each other. In my opinion, they are great in this scene. I believed they didn't like each other much at that moment (...maybe they were fighting that day and they weren't acting =0)  - we'll just forget that the scene felt a little forced to make the movie more than just a silly comedy and to give it another dimension.I also have to mention the direction. It was fun and fast paced. It worked very well for the movie.I went into this movie expecting to chuckle a couple of times. Instead, I found myself laughing out loud for nearly the entire thing. It is seriously one of the funniest things I have seen in a long time. This is one movie I would urge you to see.

623166,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMXO,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[14, 19]","My problem when I see Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen running around in robes and towels is not that I find the sexual imagery disconcerting because I remember them taking turns playing Michelle on ""Full House"" as tiny tots but because even though they are heading off to college this Fall they still look like they should be in junior high.  They can do up the hair and the makeup all they want, they still look like kids.  I want to say it is because they are only 5' 2"", but Sarah Michelle Gellar is a whole inch taller at 5' 3"" and she did not look like she should be in junior high when she did ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""  However, at this point we would end up talking about body shapes and suddenly a light bulb goes on as to why a popular, successful teenager role model would be starving herself to death, not in an effort to look more beautiful but to look older.The Olsen twins are a phenomenon, even now that they are established in the public mind as Mary-Kate and Ashley.  They have a string of successful video movies, none of which I have seen and a whole bunch of products associated with them as a brand name, none of which I use, and their official website evinces a definite responsibility towards the generation of young girls who have grown up watching them on television and in their own little movies.  With the exception of this summer's tabloid headlines their reputation has been in the too good to be true category and while a lot of people clearly do not get their appeal there are obviously millions of young girls who do.""New York Minute"" does not seek to exploit that popularity, just to ride it.  Taking anything that happens in this movie too seriously is a big mistake because the whole point is to go along for the ride.  Ashley and Mary-Kate are Jane and Roxy Ryan, a pair of high school seniors who have grown up to fulfill the oppositional nature of their names.  They are being raised by their widower father (Dr. Drew Pinsky) who has been leaving Jane to her own devices as she tries to win a scholarship to Oxford while dealing with Roxy's persistence truancy.  The film begins with the big day when Jane is going to give her speech to try and win that scholarship and Roxy is going to cut class to go see Simple Plan in concert and get copies of her band's demo CD to somebody in the music business.  Then the girls get thrown off of a train in time to have a bad guy slip a computer chip into Jane's purse and begin the chain of predictable events that will end with the inevitably predictable conclusion.Not that this should matter to anybody who loves the Olsens.  They do a great job of screaming at the same time and they get to dress up in a bunch of wild costumes.  Young viewers are probably not going to think that the pair running around half naked is a bit strange or notice how small they are when they do that great turning leap into the mosh pit at the concert or when they stand next to their respective love interests: Jane's Jim, The Bike Messenger (Riley Smith) is 6' and Roxy's Trey Lipton (Jared Padalecki) is 6' 2"".  Any film that offers a Kung fu fight between the Olsen Twins and Andy Richter is game for anything and if ""New York Minute"" is cobbled together from things the girls wanted to do in their first feature film, well it is their money and it is no different from what Sinatra and the Rat Pack were doing in their hey day.Actually the only weak part of their performances given what the story is about is the scene where they confront each other about how they have grown apart since their mother died.  Then again it makes sense that they would have trouble playing that scene because nothing else could be more alien to their life experience than the idea that a pair of twins would grow apart and go in different directions (unless you are talking having different hair colors).  But that attempt to suddenly get serious just did not fit in with the rest of the film and exposed too many of the limitations of the lead actresses.  Even in a predictable film like this one it still does not pay to go too far, which is also what happens with the deus ex machina that provides the requisite happy ending and mandates dropping this film another rating star.The supporting cast is left to their own devices a lot in this 2004 comedy.  Richter plays a bad guy adopted by a female Chinese crime boss and his accent is supposed to be Chinese but it is hard to hear most of the time.  Eugene Levy gets to mug a lot as Max Lomax, a truant officer with delusions of grandeur who treats Roxy's case as if she were #1 on the F.B.I.'s Most Wanted List.  Dr. Drew gets to be a parent at the fringe of his daughter's life, otherwise he would put a stop to their madcap adventures.  Darrell Hammond, not doing imitations for once, plays the poor guy who keeps running into Jane and Roxy so often that he should be convinced they are out to get him.  Andrea Martin plays Senator Anne Lipton, who is Trey's mom but also the owner of the ugly little dog who gets pitched out the window in the trailer and whose bowel movement becomes a key plot point.""New York Minute"" is certainly fun in a mindless sort of way, and if you do not mind mindlessness than there are enough moments here to enjoy.  If this was a film intended to convert the undecided into the Mary-Kate and Ashley court, it probably is not going to go that.  But in terms of preaching to the choir, their fans are going to have nothing to complain about here.",3,Mary-Kate and Ashley have fun before going off to college,1094256000,"09 4,

""New York Minute"" is for those who have grown up alongside Mary-Kate and Ashley and will enjoy seeing them in a movie that, yes, illustrates how much they have grown over the years. Anyone else will laugh, sneer, and tear it to shreds, but fans will respect it for what it is: a fun, lighthearted comedy. Personally, I went to see it the day it was released, and I loved it. I think a lot of people just looked at how highly publicized this film was and expected it to be something off the charts--the Olsen twins' explosion into theatrical production and adulthood. I'll admit that when I saw how much it was being promoted and how much time and work the Olsens were putting into it, I thought it was going to be a very successful film with a high public response. While it wasn't anything like that, it certainly showed a nice amount of improvements from the girls; it was a good plot, impressive acting, and highly entertaining. Compare this with some of their home videos like ""Getting There"" and ""When In Rome,"" and you just might appreciate this movie a little more. I think Mary-Kate and Ashley did a great job; they showed their potential for comedy and proved that once they take the spotlight off them a little bit and focus more on the other aspects of the story, their film is greatly strengthened.It's a real shame that ""New York Minutes"" fared so poorly at the box office; I imagine it was a real blow for the girls, but they'll get through it. They'll move on. Their 1995 feature film ""It Takes Two"" didn't do so hot either (only pulled in about $20 million), but the VHS and DVD releases sold very well; I have a feeling that the same thing will happen once this film comes to DVD in August. It is exactly the kind of film in which only the real fan can witness the evolution and the maturity in these girls. Yes, they have grown up a lot and have great things ahead of them, but for someone who despises them you're best off staying away from this movie...we all know what you think. Let the loyal followers of Mary-Kate and Ashley watch the movie and give their opinion; they're the best ones to comment because they'll give the twins the fairest shake for their efforts and everything they put into this movie.Again, I liked it a lot...I thought it was funny and enjoyable, with a far better plot and acting job from the Olsens than I have ever seen before from them.

Roxy Ryan (Mary-Kate) is the metal loving slacker noted and wanted as the most notorious truant in all of Nassau County.  It's the biggest day of both girl's lives as Jane is scheduled to make a presentation before the Oxford Scholarship committee and Roxy's band can finally get their big break by taking their demo tape to a big music producer.  Just two major problems:  Truant Officer Lamox (Levy) is hot on Roxy's trail and the girls can tangled in a web with a notorious Chinatown music and movie piracy ring.  Oh, and of course, it wouldn't be an Olsen Twins film if there weren't some cute boys involved.THE COOL STUFFLike all Olsen flicks you've got a pretty decent plot and, as is usually the case, the central theme of ""family is most important"" rings true loud and clear.

It seems not a little number of people (including me) happened to find no reason to dislike them, and 'New York Minute' is made for such viewers, especially teens who identify themselves with Ashley and Mary-Kate.  If everything in this film is so light-hearted, care-free, and even silly, that's exactly the point for we just don't want to see heavy and serious things like satires and social messeges in our ideal life.  And the director is Denise Gordon, whose last work was, not surprisingly, 'What a Girl Wants,' most appropriate title to introduce the Olsens onto the big screen.The plot unfolds as other reviewers have told us.  You can express it with six words -- ""A romp in New York City.""  That's it, and The Olsen Twins -- Jane cute uptight girl, Roxy equally cute wild girl -- have many misadventures concerning a microchip, speech for four-year shcolarship in UK, and an 'ugliest' pooch of a senetor.  And Andy Richter's baddie speaks English with a Chinese accent.  Plus Eugene Levy follows the twins because he is a truant office.  Don't ask me why, because these things just happen.[GUILTY PLEASURE?] Some may be embarrassed to see the Olsens running around in the street of New York in robe and towel.  (Yes, they do.)  And they are also the producers of the film, which means they could have refused it.  Sexaul nuance is to be found in the first half of the film, and that is no coincidence.  The opening is unashamedly obvious borrowing from 'Bring it on' in which our heroine suddenly finds that her clothes are missing (not that there is nudity).  What are these innuedoes mean?  What is the target audience?  Where are the sisters going to do next?  Perhaps better left unanswered for them and us.'New York Minute' is just a mindless entertainment, full of slapsticks best represented by spilled popcorns and a poor dog flying out of window.  But don't worry, he is alive.  Jane will get what she wants, and Roxy too, even very square Eugene Levy too.
