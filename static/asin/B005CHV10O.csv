Maybe it's not the worst movie I've ever seen but I think it must be in the ""worst 10"" somewhere.  You know, maybe there's some subtle, interesting plot that went over my head because THERE ARE NO SUBTITLES and I missed maybe 30% of the dialog but really, I couldn't care anyhow.  Have you seen movies where people fall over BEFORE the gun even FIRES?  OK what about CONSISTENTLY then?Yeah and the hero--we're supposed to believe he's some top secret agent, a 007 type.  Actually he looks more like Kim Jong Il accidentaly stumbled onto a movie set.  HEY WAIT--maybe this IS Kim Jong Il and the film was released posthumously?  After all, he had a passion for movies...THIS may be the whole secret of the film!  Really short, shrimpy guy with a terrible hairdo who looks like he couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag....Please, save yourself from this film!

1454013,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B005CHV10O,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[0, 0]","The movie opens with 4 Orientals killing everyone they encounter in the sleek corporate office of a company called &#34;Archangel.&#34; As the assassins wait outside the door of one of the offices, the movie flashes to a CIA field chief on the wrong side of the interrogation table. He claims that this all happened before the killings at archangel...cue credits and my confusion.The movie opens up with a person listed on the screen as being deceased. I am assuming this is the story leading up to what we just saw. Now is this person deceased now or is that just how he is classified by the CIA? The characters are introduced by a very fast on screen lettering (have pause button ready) that gives you their name and official CIA or KCIA (Korean CIA?) status.Julian Lee stars as Paul Thorn, who was retired and in hiding from the CIA after a bad accident. He is recruited back by a scruffy Daniel Dodd (Christopher Atkins) for a vital mission. Thorn refuses, but when the &#34;issue&#34; is brought to his Colorado home, things change.We soon discover the initial killings were part of the story being told by the field chief who provides periodic narration during the film. Agents are killing each for possession of a computer disc that no one seems to know what is on it (schematics for a deadly weapon). The movie was tiresome. The acting was dull and the direction was cliche. The soundtrack was fairly lame too.Without any fancy moves and armed only with a .45 Thorn is able to take out a group of &#34;the best&#34; agents as well as a swat team with automatic weapons and bullet proof vests (that don't seem to work). Tiffany Yee plays a swanky assassin without much in the way of lines. Min-su Choi plays Karl Kim, a Korean agent/assassin who wants the disc. John Savage plays Arlo who partners with Thorn. This movie is more akin to an old fashion spy/assassin drama than an action film, but it doesn't score too well as a drama as the characterization is limited to that of an action film.F-bomb, no sex, brief nudity (Christine Whitney)",3,"WHEN YOU MURDER YOUR WIFE, YOU TEND TO SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY,",1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,2049,"['movie', '4', 'Orientals', 'killing', 'everyone', 'encounter', 'sleek', 'corporate', 'office', 'company', 'called', '34', 'Archangel.', '34', 'assassins', 'wait', 'door', 'one', 'offices', 'movie', 'CIA', 'field', 'chief', 'wrong', 'side', 'interrogation', 'table', 'happened', 'killings', 'archangel', 'cue', 'credits', 'confusion.The', 'movie', 'up', 'person', 'listed', 'screen', 'being', 'deceased', 'am', 'assuming', 'story', 'leading', 'up', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'Now', 'person', 'deceased', 'now', 'just', 'how', 'classified', 'CIA', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'very', 'fast', 'screen', 'lettering', 'have', 'pause', 'button', 'ready', 'name', 'official', 'CIA', 'KCIA', 'Korean', 'CIA', 'status.Julian', 'Lee', 'stars', 'Paul', 'Thorn', 'who', 'was', 'retired', 'hiding', 'CIA', 'bad', 'accident', 'recruited', 'back', 'scruffy', 'Daniel', 'Dodd', 'Christopher', 'Atkins', 'vital', 'mission', 'Thorn', 'when', '34', 'issue', '34', 'brought', 'Colorado', 'home', 'things', 'change.We', 'soon', 'discover', 'initial', 'killings', 'were', 'part', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'field', 'chief', 'who', 'periodic', 'narration', 'film', 'Agents', 'are', 'killing', 'possession', 'computer', 'disc', 'one', 'know', 'what', 'schematics', 'deadly', 'weapon', 'movie', 'was', 'tiresome', 'acting', 'was', 'dull', 'direction', 'was', 'cliche', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'fairly', 'lame', 'fancy', 'moves', 'armed', 'only', '.45', 'Thorn', 'able', 'take', 'out', 'group', '34', 'best', '34', 'agents', 'as', 'well', 'swat', 'team', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'bullet', 'proof', 'vests', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'Tiffany', 'Yee', 'swanky', 'assassin', 'much', 'way', 'lines', 'Min-su', 'Choi', 'Karl', 'Kim', 'Korean', 'agent/assassin', 'who', 'disc', 'John', 'Savage', 'Arlo', 'who', 'partners', 'Thorn', 'movie', 'more', 'akin', 'old', 'fashion', 'spy/assassin', 'drama', 'action', 'film', ""n't"", 'score', 'too', 'well', 'drama', 'characterization', 'limited', 'action', 'film.F-bomb', 'sex', 'brief', 'nudity', 'Christine', 'Whitney']",Assassin's Code
