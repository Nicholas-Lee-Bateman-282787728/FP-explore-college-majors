587410,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JKJM,A Customer,"[0, 0]","Summary:Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) is an inspector in Whitechapel (I believe it is part of London).  When women begin turning up dead and mutilated, Inspector Abberline is called upon to solve the case.  The story in the movie is very complicated, so let me see if I can simplify it: A group of prostitutes (making up the five women that are killed by Jack the Ripper) have a friend, Ann Crook (Joanna Page) who is married to whom they believe to be an artist.  As it turns out, he is a member of the royal family and his underground marriage to Ann is bringing shame on the throne.  This isn't a problem until Ann has a baby who could actually become heir to the throne.  It just so happens that Ann gives the baby to Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) the day that she and her husband are taken away.  Ann ends up undergoing a lobotomy and spending the rest of her life in asylums.  The prince has syphilis and dies from it.  The problem is that the group of prostitutes know the secret and the royal family can't have that, so they must be silenced.  The prime minister charges Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) with getting rid of the prostitutes.  Sir William, however, chooses to kill them rather than have them committed and as a Freemason, he chooses to have them killed according to the Masonic ritual killing methods specified in their induction ceremonies.  Inspector Abberline figures out what is going on with the help of Mary Kelly and does his best to save her.  In the end, Sir William turns out to be Jack the Ripper and, because this is a royal plot, Inspector Abberline isn't able to stop him in time to prevent the deaths of all of the prostitutes even though he has fallen in love with Mary Kelly.  But, there is a final twist and you'll just have to watch the movie to find out what it is.My Comments:I really liked the movie.  It was suspenseful and really kept you guessing as to the identity of the murderer throughout.  Johnny Depp was, as always, superb and most of the rest of the cast was as well.  As for casting Heather Graham as Mary Kelly, she just didn't fit the part physically.  She did a good job of playing the part, she just isn't the type of 'beauty' that would be a prostitute in the late 1800s.  So, that was one strike against the film.The second problem is not with the film.  Like I said, the movie was really good.  The problem is that they don't really make it all that clear in watching the special feature clips that the stories surrounding the identity of Jack the Ripper are all just stories.  The murders were never solved and the story told in the movie is just one version of the possible events surrounding the murders with some added twists and turns for dramatic effect.  However, the twists and turns work to make this a very engaging movie.  I highly recommend it for people that are into psychological murder thrillers.  It was a lot of fun.",4,Captivating,1045958400,"02 23, 2003",2003,2890,"['Summary', 'Fred', 'Abberline', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'inspector', 'Whitechapel', 'believe', 'part', 'London', 'When', 'women', 'begin', 'turning', 'up', 'dead', 'mutilated', 'Inspector', 'Abberline', 'called', 'solve', 'case', 'story', 'movie', 'very', 'complicated', 'so', 'let', 'see', 'can', 'simplify', 'group', 'prostitutes', 'making', 'up', 'five', 'women', 'are', 'killed', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'have', 'friend', 'Ann', 'Crook', 'Joanna', 'Page', 'who', 'married', 'whom', 'believe', 'be', 'artist', 'out', 'member', 'royal', 'family', 'underground', 'marriage', 'Ann', 'bringing', 'shame', 'throne', ""n't"", 'problem', 'Ann', 'baby', 'who', 'could', 'actually', 'become', 'heir', 'throne', 'just', 'so', 'Ann', 'baby', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'day', 'husband', 'are', 'taken', 'away', 'Ann', 'up', 'undergoing', 'lobotomy', 'spending', 'rest', 'life', 'asylums', 'prince', 'syphilis', 'dies', 'problem', 'group', 'prostitutes', 'know', 'secret', 'royal', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'must', 'be', 'silenced', 'prime', 'minister', 'charges', 'Sir', 'William', 'Gull', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'getting', 'rid', 'prostitutes', 'Sir', 'William', 'however', 'kill', 'rather', 'have', 'committed', 'Freemason', 'have', 'killed', 'according', 'Masonic', 'ritual', 'killing', 'methods', 'specified', 'induction', 'ceremonies', 'Inspector', 'Abberline', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'help', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'best', 'save', 'end', 'Sir', 'William', 'out', 'be', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'royal', 'plot', 'Inspector', 'Abberline', ""n't"", 'able', 'stop', 'time', 'prevent', 'deaths', 'prostitutes', 'even', 'fallen', 'love', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'final', 'twist', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'is.My', 'Comments', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'suspenseful', 'really', 'kept', 'guessing', 'identity', 'murderer', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'always', 'superb', 'most', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'casting', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'part', 'physically', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'part', 'just', ""n't"", 'type', ""'beauty"", 'would', 'be', 'prostitute', 'late', '1800s', 'So', 'was', 'one', 'strike', 'film.The', 'second', 'problem', 'not', 'film', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'clear', 'watching', 'special', 'feature', 'clips', 'stories', 'surrounding', 'identity', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'are', 'just', 'stories', 'murders', 'were', 'never', 'solved', 'story', 'told', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'version', 'possible', 'events', 'surrounding', 'murders', 'added', 'twists', 'turns', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'However', 'twists', 'work', 'make', 'very', 'engaging', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'people', 'are', 'psychological', 'murder', 'thrillers', 'was', 'lot', 'fun']",From Hell

Based on entirely true events envolving the notorious Jack the Ripper, From Hell submerges the audience into the muck and grissly sights surrounding the murders of five ""unfortunates"".Johnny Depp plays an inspector that is given charge to capture Jack the Ripper. He has a special gift, the ability to forsee the murders. Unfortunately, this is while he dances with the ""Dragon"", a drug of Absinth, Poison and Sugar cubes. Heather Graham, in the performance of her life up to this point, is an ""unfortunate"" on the Ripper's list. Does she survive?I couldn't believe this disc. Its practically perfect. It stands near ""Se7en"" as far as quality goes. The Reds are stark and the darks merge with the black bars most will see on the top and bottom of your screen. Sometimes, its so dark, that these bars disappear. The yellows are what I agree (with a friend of mine) to be sickeningly yellow. Really well done and the extra's are everything informative you'd want to know about Jack the Ripper. Considering that not much is known in the first place, I would say there couldn't be a better set included.One nice touch that I liked, for you people with strong stomachs, was the flies buzzing around my speakers. I was actually swatting by my ear before I realized what was going on. You can guess when the flies show up. The sound is fantastic, whether or not you have the DTS setup.

587413,A5ABW4JY88BL3,B00005JKJM,AJM,"[1, 1]","I enjoyed this movie because it made an otherwise implausible, and actual hypothesis regarding Jack the Ripper, quite...probable! This should please anyone who is into conspiracy theories. I can't say much here, but the plot is very interesting, even if at times predictable. I thought it was neat because the script really nodded to several theories and events that really existed, and several real characters. Even Depp's character, Albernine(?), was an actual person- although the fictional and real person had very different destinies.I love Depp- I think he's a fine actor. If you liked him in Sleepy Hollow, then you'll see echoes of that performance here- although in a much more darker tone. He was abe to give his character personality and dimension- here's a sensitive person, at many levels, who has suffered enormous loss- a loss which is mentioned in a few seconds, but is alluded to in the entire being of this character.Heather Graham is lovely, and I thought she held her own quite well- except for the flirtation between her character and Depp's. There was absolutely no chemistry there- and I have to agree with the reviewer who panned the film for showing Graham as clean, radiant and lovely, while her colleagues, sharing in the same squallor and misery, were, correctly, more decrepit. You just cannot believe that Graham, clean, with all her teeth, and with nicely curled hair, is starving, as she claims. It was  distracting.The visuals of the movie are great- like an absynthe-induced hallucination itself. It had its share of symbolism and although not too complicated, enjoyable.I didn't find it frightening or overly graphic, although some of the images can be a bit disturbing.I like it because I enjoyed seeing an actual theory come to life, and because Depp is so wonderful to watch.",4,Entertaining enough,1034640000,"10 15, 2002",2002,1813,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'made', 'otherwise', 'implausible', 'actual', 'hypothesis', 'regarding', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'quite', 'probable', 'should', 'please', 'anyone', 'who', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'here', 'plot', 'very', 'interesting', 'even', 'times', 'predictable', 'thought', 'was', 'neat', 'script', 'really', 'nodded', 'several', 'theories', 'events', 'really', 'existed', 'several', 'real', 'characters', 'Even', 'Depp', 'character', 'Albernine', 'was', 'actual', 'person-', 'fictional', 'real', 'person', 'had', 'very', 'different', 'destinies.I', 'Depp-', 'think', 'fine', 'actor', 'liked', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'then', ""'ll"", 'see', 'echoes', 'performance', 'here-', 'much', 'more', 'darker', 'tone', 'was', 'abe', 'give', 'character', 'personality', 'dimension-', 'here', 'sensitive', 'person', 'many', 'levels', 'who', 'suffered', 'enormous', 'loss-', 'loss', 'mentioned', 'few', 'seconds', 'alluded', 'entire', 'being', 'character.Heather', 'Graham', 'lovely', 'thought', 'held', 'own', 'quite', 'well-', 'flirtation', 'character', 'Depp', 'was', 'absolutely', 'chemistry', 'there-', 'have', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'panned', 'film', 'showing', 'Graham', 'clean', 'radiant', 'lovely', 'colleagues', 'sharing', 'same', 'squallor', 'misery', 'were', 'correctly', 'more', 'decrepit', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'Graham', 'clean', 'teeth', 'nicely', 'curled', 'hair', 'starving', 'was', 'distracting.The', 'visuals', 'movie', 'are', 'great-', 'absynthe-induced', 'hallucination', 'had', 'share', 'symbolism', 'not', 'too', 'complicated', 'enjoyable.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'frightening', 'overly', 'graphic', 'images', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'disturbing.I', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'actual', 'theory', 'come', 'life', 'Depp', 'so', 'wonderful', 'watch']",From Hell

In the featurette the producer even admits they didn't have the guts to base the film around the murderer himself. Instead we have a formulaic hollywood take. Depp is horribly miscast and gives an unusually lazy performance that doesn't go beyond a mere caricature of a certain contemporary London accent. Coltrane merely waltzes through the movie as a rather pathetic sidekick. The set though nice to look at is far too clean and lacks any real atmosphere. It's size appears to have had a limiting effect with London's multitude of the unwashed completely absent but for a few stragglers. The essence of the great city lost. What really lets the movie down is the total absence of the passion and outrage of the book. Their is no anger, the social conditions are merely glossed over. The satanic freemasonic overtones of the novel are nowhere to be seen. Basically anything of interest from the novel has been as surgically removed as Mary Kelly's heart. All in all a big mess that fails to do justice to the book.

I'm not quite sure I understand that, but, they may do as they please. I HAVE seen this film. &quot;From Hell&quot; from the very first shot sets up a mood, a certain feeling, that carries threw-out the rest of the film. The movie captivates us to another time in history. 1888, London to be exact. The movie is stunningly filmed by Peter Deming. The whole film has a feeling of mystery to it. There's a contemptuous feeling in the air. This is what makes &quot;From Hell&quot; work. The cinematography, the costume designs by Kym Barrett, the production designs by Martin Childs, the art direction by Mark Reggett, and finally the music by Trevor Jones and Marilyn Manson. All of these people play an enormous role in the film's success. &quot;From Hell&quot; is best described as a wickedly evil nightmare. There's a demonic energy in the directing by the Hughes Brothers. They have, or at least in this film, a subtle approach to what they do. Before I go on with my review, I want to point out to everyone before they go see this movie, this is not for the faint of heart. Many will call this a &quot;difficult&quot;, &quot;disturbing&quot;, and vile movie. But, then again, when dealing with a movie about Jack the Ripper, what were you expecting? An &quot;Once Upon A Time&quot; beginning and a &quot;Happily ever after&quot; ending?! If you have childern, don't make this movie part of your &quot;family night&quot; unless your childern are at least teenagers, don't take them to see this. The film consist of scenes dealing with violence and gore. Bodies are mutilated. If you think you can stand it, and actually want to see a movie with these sort of graphic scenes, &quot;From Hell&quot; will not let you down.The movie stars Johnny Depp as Inspector Frederick Abberline. He's a detective who has an unusual gift for sometimes being able to &quot;dream&quot; the next step Jack the Ripper will take, and for that matter, the next step any murderer will take. At first very little is known about whom they are dealing with. Is it one person? Or is it local thugs who act like pimps? Only after Frederick (Depp, who's had a very good year, First with &quot;Blow&quot; and now this) meets Mary Kelly (Heather Graham, who needed this movie to come along after the awful &quot;Say It Isn't So!)and Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) does everything start to take shape for him. Also Robbie Coltrane has a co-starring part in a way giving the film a certain comic relief. I'm not quite sure as to just how badly this character was needed. But despite that, the acting is enjoyable. The characters don't have much depth to them, but, there is the level of intrigue to the film that keeps you going along with it. If you are interested in Jack the Ripper and think you can stand some of the scenes I've mentioned, I think &quot;From Hell&quot; will be worth the price of admission.",3,A Hellish Experience!,1003449600,"10 19, 2001",2001,2980,"['people', 'have', 'already', 'started', 'writing', 'reviews', 'film', 'have', 'even', 'seen', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'understand', 'may', 'do', 'please', 'HAVE', 'seen', 'film', 'quot', 'From', 'Hell', 'quot', 'very', 'first', 'shot', 'up', 'mood', 'certain', 'feeling', 'rest', 'film', 'movie', 'time', 'history', '1888', 'London', 'be', 'exact', 'movie', 'stunningly', 'filmed', 'Peter', 'Deming', 'whole', 'film', 'feeling', 'mystery', 'contemptuous', 'feeling', 'air', 'what', 'quot', 'From', 'Hell', 'quot', 'work', 'cinematography', 'costume', 'designs', 'Kym', 'Barrett', 'production', 'designs', 'Martin', 'Childs', 'art', 'direction', 'Mark', 'Reggett', 'finally', 'music', 'Trevor', 'Jones', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'people', 'play', 'enormous', 'role', 'film', 'success', 'quot', 'From', 'Hell', 'quot', 'best', 'described', 'wickedly', 'evil', 'nightmare', 'demonic', 'energy', 'directing', 'Hughes', 'Brothers', 'have', 'least', 'film', 'subtle', 'approach', 'what', 'do', 'go', 'review', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'everyone', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'Many', 'will', 'call', 'quot', 'difficult', 'quot', 'quot', 'disturbing', 'quot', 'vile', 'movie', 'then', 'again', 'when', 'dealing', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'what', 'were', 'expecting', 'quot', 'Once', 'A', 'Time', 'quot', 'beginning', 'quot', 'Happily', 'ever', 'quot', 'ending', 'have', 'childern', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'part', 'quot', 'family', 'night', 'quot', 'childern', 'are', 'least', 'teenagers', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'see', 'film', 'consist', 'scenes', 'dealing', 'violence', 'gore', 'Bodies', 'are', 'mutilated', 'think', 'can', 'stand', 'actually', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'sort', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'quot', 'From', 'Hell', 'quot', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'down.The', 'movie', 'stars', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Inspector', 'Frederick', 'Abberline', 'detective', 'who', 'unusual', 'gift', 'sometimes', 'being', 'able', 'quot', 'dream', 'quot', 'next', 'step', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'will', 'take', 'matter', 'next', 'step', 'murderer', 'will', 'take', 'first', 'very', 'little', 'known', 'whom', 'are', 'dealing', 'one', 'person', 'local', 'thugs', 'who', 'act', 'pimps', 'Only', 'Frederick', 'Depp', 'who', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'year', 'First', 'quot', 'Blow', 'quot', 'now', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'who', 'needed', 'movie', 'come', 'along', 'awful', 'quot', 'Say', ""n't"", 'So', 'Sir', 'William', 'Gull', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'everything', 'start', 'take', 'shape', 'Also', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'co-starring', 'part', 'way', 'giving', 'film', 'certain', 'comic', 'relief', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'just', 'how', 'badly', 'character', 'was', 'needed', 'acting', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'depth', 'level', 'intrigue', 'film', 'going', 'are', 'interested', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'think', 'can', 'stand', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'think', 'quot', 'From', 'Hell', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'price', 'admission']",From Hell

Heather Graham was absolutely stunning in this film, nothing compares to that gorgeous red hair of hers. I couldn't believe how excellent this movie was, with the twists and turns I should have guessed who the ripper was, and felt pretty embarressed when I couldn't figure it out until the end.Most of the time my mouth was wide open, because of the intensity I got from the lewdness of it all. What did I expect though it was a movie about a serial killer? All the women in the film, really set the profile for a group of prostitutes or ""unfortunates"". I'm very glad I didn't live on the east end of Britain in the 1880's. I always believed that men killed or raped woman, in order to feel more powerful. I thought that since we have had so many more killings now that it was possibly because American woman have gained more rights, and this has caused men to lose the superiority mind-set they once had so many years ago.

It's a brilliant marketing ploy in that even the film's detractors may want to get their hands on it simply for the bonus material. That said, fans of the movie will find themselves gleefully wallowing in the goodies that await them on disc two: the featurettes ""Jack The Ripper: Six Degrees Of Separation"" and ""Absinthe Makes The Heart Grow Fonder"" (an informative insight into the history of absinthe), a handful of behind-the-scenes shorts, and over twenty deleted scenes including the film's alternate ending (which is really more of an alternate take on the same ending). There are several hidden ""easter eggs"" as well, but by far the most worthwhile and interesting is a 40-minute documentary made in 1980 for British television that is said to have been the very inspiration for the graphic novel from which the movie was based.

You salivate at the very idea of the film achieving and even surpassing all expectations as it devours you with that uneasy feeling of imminent repulsion and sheer dread.Despite fantastically realized production design and sharply implemented edits; `From Hell' loses most of its staying power thanks to a strange lack of fear.The film attacks the story of Jack the Ripper from the vantage point of a Scotland Yard sleuth by the name of Frederick Abberline.  Abberline has opium influenced visions of the slayings perpetrated by the Ripper, and so he uses these visions to further his investigation, picking away at the mystery behind the blood.  Along the way he is aided by a street walker (bet they weren't referred to as those in that day) and derailed by nearly everyone else.  Uncovering the truth behind the murders is apparently a dangerous journey; one that certain members of society would work their fingers to the bone to make sure went unfulfilled.When the opium induced fog has lifted, it becomes sadly apparent that `From Hell' is not all that it could have been.  For a film of such salacious subject, it is surprisingly mild.  Despite the influx of prostitutes there is barely a scene of sexuality, and the murders themselves are faintly hinted at or contain minor moments of shock gore that is forgettable and underwhelming.  This could have been forgiven had the films core been devoted to a more fleshed out and detailed depiction of the `inner monster' dealing these dastardly deeds, but instead the revelatory climax is weakened by a mere surface attempt at identifying a monster.  Sure, the film offers it's `viewpoint', but it under-works it.The film wants to be a horror film but it lacks the horror.Johnny Depp delivers the same performance he gives in all his other movies, and he does a decent enough job to escape my usual dismembering of his talent (the man just needs to go away).  Heather Graham tries her hardest here, but the script is so unkind to her (she could have handled a deeper character, don't you think) and it made her a forgettable clich&eacute;.  I love Ian Holm, and he definitely steals a lot of the audience's attention, but I feel that it isn't always in a good way.The uneven nature of the script (which really should have been reworked a few dozen times before production) does no justice to a tale that should be brandished upon the minds of all.

The Hughes Brothers have dusted off the old boy's story and done him up a treat!Quite crazily fanatical in their devotion to detail, the Hughes Brothers have confessed to an enduring obsession about Red Jack.  I, rather shamefacedly, must admit the same.  There is something about the fog-shrouded lanes of Whitechapel, prowled by the diabolical and demonic murderer, dressed to the nines in formal cape & top hat (we imagine) with black surgeon's bag hiding the long slim razor sharp scalpels with which he does his horrid work, that is so chilling and creepy.  And  that he does his villainy on poor, broken-down prostitutes with such a ferocity,  that deep & dark motives must be at play here.  It is the fuel for both nightmares & movies.Others must share this fascination, for we have had him as a fixture in our imagination from The Lodger on to dozens of film and television treatments and riffs on the theme, i.e., encounters with Sherlock Holmes etc.Well, the Hughes's have done a job here, in some instances with absolute brilliance.  This is a dark and moody meditation on the Ripper, as stylish and delirious as Johnny Depp's Inspector Aberline's fever-dream hallucinations.  Beautifully shot and composed with clever uses of the camera and an evocation of those foggy streets, filled with terror and panic.Certainly not for everyone.  This is a superbly crafted film of  an admittedly peculiar interest. Jack the Ripper has provided a Hannibal Lecter-like fascination for audiences for 100 years now.  The granddaddy of them all, Red Jack was the real deal, and the true fascination is in his unrevealed identity which leaves him open to any interpretation imagination can take us.

This film fits more of the whodunnnit murder mystery genre, but it's about the most famous slasher in world history so it's inevitably going to be associated with slasher films.I really love when stories based on true events come up with very creative answers to the questions history doesn't have for us. The plot in this film evolves from &quot;Who is Jack the Ripper?&quot; into something much bigger. The writers definately take some artistic liberty with the plot; turning a simple murder mystery into something more epic involving the monarchy government and secret societies. Since Jack the Ripper was never caught, these fictionalizations create a very interesting motivation for the main character.The acting in this movie was impressive.

Of course, you can't really watch this film as a complete history lesson. I'll explain later. The movie tells the story about Jack The Ripper, a name given to a serial killer who brutally slaughtered five prostitutes(could be more)nearly 114 years ago in London. Nobody knew who this man was. They still don't. In comes Johnny Depp, who plays a Scotland Yard inspector named Abberline. This is a man with his own problems. He is addicted to opium, and this addiction seems to help him solve murders by having visions of the crimes. He befriends prostitute Mary Kelly(who, in real life, was a victim)played by Heather Graham, who is part of the circle of prostitutes being killed. Isn't it funny how all of her fellow prostitutes are on the unattractive side but she is pretty?. Robbie Coltrane(""Harry Potter"", ""Nuns On The Run"")is on hand as Depp's sgt. The cast also includes Ian Holm, who you may remember from such films as ""Alien"" and ""The Fifth Element"". He plays a doctor who no longer practices because of an ailment. The Hughes Brothers(Allen and Albert), direct this film with a sure hand. It is exquisitley shot and looks great. There are a number of scenes that are filled with haunting visuals. The town and costumes are great. Beautiful. The acting is pretty solid. Heather Graham is a decent actress, but she hasn't been given any good stuff since ""Boogie Nights"". She is passable here, but there isn't a whole lot to her. Ian Holm steals the show with his ill doctor character. Robbie Coltrane is always watchable. Johnny Depp is pretty good. There is no doubt that he is one of the best actors of his generation, but his performance here is kinda routine. Not that it's bad. Some people say he's just like Ichabod Crane in ""Sleepy Hollow"" again. No way. These two movies and characters are as different as night and day. His accent is pretty good too. The ending of this film tells you who the ripper is. But don't think that you were actually given a positive answer to this mystery. You aren't. The fact is that nobody really knows who Jack The Ripper was. This crime has gone unsolved for over a 100 years. There have been theories and thoughts since then, but no real proof. He could've been caught, but he could also of gotten away. No one knows who he really was or what happened to him and probably never will. The filmmakers here pretty much took one theory and used it. But there can be no satisfactory ending here. I suggest you read some books on this subject or check out some web sites on who some of the alleged suspects were. It is a fascinating mystery made into a decent, but still somewhat unsatisfying, film. It is very violent and may not be of your liking. I enjoyed it well enough.

587437,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B00005JKJM,Ben Rowland,"[0, 2]","The mystique behind the real identity of Jack the Ripper is probably the only reason why the case has remained interesting for this long. Over 100 years later, the case has never been solved, though there are plenty who claim to know who the real killer is. Enter the Hughes Brothers and their adaption of the popular graphic novel, From Hell. As a movie, it is intelligent and well made, with strong performances and plenty of twists.Johnny Depp gives on of his most memorable performances as Inspector Abberline, who in real life was assigned to the Ripper murders and retired having never solved the case. He is a drug-addicted police inspector who has a reputation for solving crimes through his clairvoyance. His abilities and loyalties are put to the test when prostitutes in Whitechaple, a slum of London, are murdered most foul by the Ripper. The story is nothing new, but new life is breathed into it by the Hughes Brothers artful direction and Rafael Yglesias's colorful screenplay. Also giving stellar performances are Robbie Coltrane as Abberlines intellectual partner, and Ian Holm as the doctor assisting in the investigation. Less than stellar is Heather Graham, though, and her presence as Mary Kelly (one of the victims) and the contrived love story that ensues is the one Achilles heel in this movie.With 2 editions of this DVD out now, the 2-disc set is the one to go with. The well put together &quot;Jack the Ripper: Six Degrees of Separation&quot; is an examination on the murders, the suspects, and the investigation. But the best of all featurettes is actually a hidden easter egg. Highlight &quot;Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder&quot; on Disc 2, and quickly press down and right. You'll see a surgical tool highlighted and it will take you to a 40 minute documentary called &quot;Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution&quot; (snippets of which are seen in the interactive parts of the first featurette). This was produced in 1980 and features an interview with author Stephen Knight, who wrote the book on which the graphic novel, and this movie, is based. It is a fascinating documentary, and one that sketches broad strokes on the killings and the conspiracy that covered them. The other good featurette is the aformentioned &quot;Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder&quot;, which is a breif lesson on the history of the notorious drink, and it's impact on culture and art. Skippable is the horrible Heather Graham-hosted &quot;A View From Hell&quot;, which is a retread of well-known facts. Perhaps good for one or two viewings is the Hughes Brother's &quot;Tour of Murder Sites&quot;, where they walk you around the From Hell set is Prauge. It would have prefered a tour of the actual murder sites.A lot of people didn't like this movie, calling it a glorified slasher movie. While the violence is plentiful, the intelligence of the script and the style if directon make this distinction unfair. It is a great movie, and the 2 DVD treatment will provide you with hours of entertainment, as well as a history lesson on the Jack the Ripper case.",4,&quot;At least they got the address right...&quot;,1061164800,"08 18, 2003",2003,3074,"['mystique', 'real', 'identity', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'probably', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'case', 'remained', 'interesting', 'long', '100', 'years', 'later', 'case', 'never', 'been', 'solved', 'are', 'plenty', 'who', 'claim', 'know', 'who', 'real', 'killer', 'Enter', 'Hughes', 'Brothers', 'adaption', 'popular', 'graphic', 'novel', 'From', 'Hell', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'well', 'made', 'strong', 'performances', 'plenty', 'twists.Johnny', 'Depp', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Inspector', 'Abberline', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'assigned', 'Ripper', 'murders', 'retired', 'having', 'never', 'solved', 'case', 'drug-addicted', 'police', 'inspector', 'who', 'reputation', 'solving', 'crimes', 'clairvoyance', 'abilities', 'loyalties', 'are', 'put', 'test', 'when', 'prostitutes', 'Whitechaple', 'slum', 'London', 'are', 'murdered', 'most', 'foul', 'Ripper', 'story', 'nothing', 'new', 'new', 'life', 'breathed', 'Hughes', 'Brothers', 'artful', 'direction', 'Rafael', 'Yglesias', 'colorful', 'screenplay', 'Also', 'giving', 'stellar', 'performances', 'are', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'Abberlines', 'intellectual', 'partner', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'doctor', 'assisting', 'investigation', 'Less', 'stellar', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'though', 'presence', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'one', 'victims', 'contrived', 'love', 'story', 'one', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'movie.With', '2', 'editions', 'DVD', 'out', 'now', '2-disc', 'set', 'one', 'go', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'quot', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'Six', 'Degrees', 'Separation', 'quot', 'examination', 'murders', 'suspects', 'investigation', 'best', 'featurettes', 'actually', 'hidden', 'easter', 'egg', 'Highlight', 'quot', 'Absinthe', 'heart', 'grow', 'fonder', 'quot', 'Disc', '2', 'quickly', 'press', 'down', 'right', ""'ll"", 'see', 'surgical', 'tool', 'highlighted', 'will', 'take', '40', 'minute', 'documentary', 'called', 'quot', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'Final', 'Solution', 'quot', 'snippets', 'are', 'seen', 'interactive', 'parts', 'first', 'featurette', 'was', 'produced', '1980', 'interview', 'author', 'Stephen', 'Knight', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'graphic', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'one', 'broad', 'strokes', 'killings', 'conspiracy', 'covered', 'other', 'good', 'featurette', 'aformentioned', 'quot', 'Absinthe', 'heart', 'grow', 'fonder', 'quot', 'breif', 'lesson', 'history', 'notorious', 'drink', 'impact', 'culture', 'art', 'Skippable', 'horrible', 'Heather', 'Graham-hosted', 'quot', 'View', 'From', 'Hell', 'quot', 'retread', 'well-known', 'facts', 'Perhaps', 'good', 'one', 'two', 'viewings', 'Hughes', 'Brother', 'quot', 'Tour', 'Murder', 'Sites', 'quot', 'where', 'walk', 'From', 'Hell', 'set', 'Prauge', 'would', 'have', 'prefered', 'tour', 'actual', 'murder', 'sites.A', 'lot', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'calling', 'glorified', 'slasher', 'movie', 'violence', 'plentiful', 'intelligence', 'script', 'style', 'directon', 'make', 'distinction', 'unfair', 'great', 'movie', '2', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'will', 'provide', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'as', 'well', 'history', 'lesson', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'case']",From Hell

It wasn't as good as I expected, but was entertaining.Being the comic book geek that I am, I went into the movie expecting a sprawling epic, and suspensful tale of Jack the Rippers murders.  Instead we get a rather convulted story that sort of sticks to the plot of Alan Moores original graphic novel but not really.  Having read the behomth From Hell a few times now, I can point to parts where more character development could have been alittle better.  Particularly with the character of William Gull.  In the book he is much more of a disturbed psycho than in the movie.  He books shows that he used to cut up animals as a kid, and had a bad experience sexually with his wife.  His obsession with the freemason rhetoric is also very disturbing in his book as well as the fact that he believes he is creating a work of art.  All of these things would have helped in character development and made it much more disturbing.  Johnny Depp plays a decent Aberline, and looks the part, other than the fact Aberline in the book is alittle more plump.  Heather Graham seems oddly out of place in this movie.  Now why is it all the other prostitutes are ugly and she is the only good looking one of the bunch.  She does a good job as Mary Kelly though.Another thing I noticed was the romance seems to very aparent in the movie, but in the book it is more or less implied.  In the book they don't even know each others names and when she disapears Aberline doesn't really know what to think.In my opinion the best scene in the movie was when Gull is taking out Kellys heart.  He hallucinates that he is doing an anatomy lesson is very chilling and psychological.  Overall I realize the book and the movie are diffrent, but I still like From Hell quite a bit.

This DVD satisfies both the ripperologist and movie fan by providing 2 DVDs, the first being the movie, the second having several good features on theories loaded with photos from the time period.As for the movie itself, the sets are incredibly accurate. But some of the acting by Heather Graham and Johnny Depp detracts from the wonderful surroundings. I don't know if they needed better speech coaches or different actors, but the first part of the movie I had to try and overlook their poor English accents. Some aspects of the story are far fetched even for Jack the Ripper.

Definitely not for the faint of stomach, From Hell deals with a very realistic side of the Jack the Ripper murders.Johnny Depp is fantastic as the tragedy plagued inspector.  He carries the film in grand style, as always, and brings intrigue and mystery to the screen.The film is better if you have a basic knowledge of the Jack the Ripper murders, and theories regarding who the killer was.  While living in London, I learned about the murders and was intrigued by the theories, and the lack of any decisive evidence.The film combines several of the theories, and makes for an intriguing guess as to who the killer may have been.The direction in this film is superb.  The screen aches with the eerie Whitechapel London setting, making it understandable how these murders could have occured while people were nearby.  It is a dark film, but this darkness is used in a brilliant fashion, highlighting and lowlighting particular scenes.All in all I give it ****, because it is a remarkably well-done period piece, with a courageous plot, although Heather Graham's performance was her usual standard.

Yes the Final Solution does strain crediblity, especially when you consider Gull (Holm's Character) was well into his seventies, but the Hughes addressed this with element of insanity. This film features the most authentic recreation of the Whitechapel Murderers handiwork ever committed to the big screen. The European setting, the custom built Whitechapel set, the excellent casting, acting, sound, and layering of content make this more than a competant effort. What did the Hughes Brothers in a the box office was an even more horrendous event than Whitechapel, September 11. The timing of releasing a darkly toned, foriegn set, period peice police procedural could not have been worse. Plus, when you consider the target audience being educated, mostly male (sorry, ladies), crime buffs, it is a wonder that it was #1 for a week.The Brothers are making an audacious statement here about The Man, and being a egalitarian caucasian, myself, I agree. At the time of the actual murders, the conditions in Whitechapel were an example of how ineptly western society dealt with its foriegner/poor. The implication of the Royal Order of Freemasons only serves to highlight the dichotomy in caste between the wealthy and the down-trodden, especially in the light of what the elite will do to maintain thier status. The verismilitude of the production make it knife sharp in its attempt to portray a type of society that existed then in Great Britain, and that still exists in the World now on a grander scale. Johnny Depp follows up in a perfect way from his Sleepy Hollow mold. The only two points of contention that I have are minor. The contacts were too large on Holm and looked a tad silly, rather that menacing. When the bed in Kelleys room was moved for the final(?) murder, it took away from an important identification that Ripperologist needed from this film. That is, the imfamous Kelley Crime Scene photograph being one of first, and still on of the most appalling visions ever beheld, was denied its truth and effect here, and no matter how much the director desired to throw a door-way shadow across the bed, the horror of the Kelly Murder over shadows the entire case, and deserved a movie in itself.

587446,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00005JKJM,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","If you follow my reviews, you know that I felt the version of ""Jack the Ripper"" with Michael Caine as Inspector Fred Abberline was a phenomenal masterpiece. Not only was Michael Caine outstanding in the role, but that version offered convincing speculation into a mystery that we will never know all the answers to.While I respect this version with Johnny Depp in the role as a great horror flick, it is not nearly as historical as Caine's. (History is to some extent sacrificed for Horror and to some extent Romance.) Some of you may know the Ripper's 5 victims. (Mary Anne Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, kathy Eadows, and Mary Jane Kelly) Well, they have a close friendship, and we get the impression that they share some dangerous secret. (In the Michael Caine version, they knew each other, but they were just associates.)Well, of course, Jack the Ripper comes into play. One scene is well done in that while we don't see his face, we do see some disturbing pictures, and we do see him cutting steak and pouring a dark red wine. In comes Depp (Inspector Fred Abberline.) it is interesting that while the older Michael Caine brought frustration and tremendous energy to the role, Depp makes him look morose and like he is going to die any day. (Perhaps Depp did not want to just imitate Michael Caine.)One thing I have some trouble with is that while Caine had some trouble with his superiors, we could understand Caine's superiors views to some extent. here, it is obvious that Depp's superiors are getting frustrated with him while they are obviously keeping things from him. At least Caine's superiors carried some reason on their side.You'll probably notice that Depp finds things out quicker than Caine did. (Caine had 4 hours. Depp only has 2.) While Caine was involved with an artist, Depp becomes involved with the eventual 5th victim Mary Jane Kelly. Depp of course discovers things that eventually start completeing a puzzle. Like Caine did in his version, Depp ironically gets close and friendly to the killer (obviously without knowing he is talking to the killer).One slight problem I have is that in the Caine version, we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and even offered helpful advice. In this version, it seems strange that the killer is friendly to Depp and offers help. (Jack the Ripper does not have the same split personality here that he did in the Caine version.)I will admit that the scenery is well done, the elements of horror are there, an Depp did a great job of not just imitating Michael Caine. And Depp's Sergeant Godley does offer some entertainment. But if you saw the Michael Caine version, you will undoubtedly miss the probable historical accuracy. On the other hand, this version is geared more towards horror. (So if that is what you want, you won't be disappointed.)SIDE NOTE: Johnny Depp makes Inspector Fred Abberline look like he is going to die any day.

Bourgeois,"[1, 1]","Sadly, a lot of reviewers have noted that there are many inaccuracies in the film concerning the factual details in the case of Jack the Ripper.  Certainly, the Ripper theory thats the premise of this film is quite controversial and is no doubt way off the mark.  But the Hughes Brothers did not intend to get the facts &quot;dead&quot; on, rather, they have created in my estimation one of the finest visual films ever made.  The London, circa 1888, that they have put on the screen is pure eye candy.  The sets are meticulous recreations of 1888 London, and the saturated colors create an ominous and foreboding pallette on which to tell the story.  The overall mood and look of the film reminds one at first of perhaps Francis Ford Coppola's DRACULA or Tim Burton's SLEEPY HOLLOW, but this film's look is better and what might be expected if you were able to look into the mind of Edgar Allen Poe.I have not mentioned the performances, but they were wonderful as well.

587450,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,B00005JKJM,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[1, 2]","""From Hell"", the 2005 Jack the Ripper opus from the Hughes Brothers, almost makes the grade as the definitive movie about Victorian England's elusive killer.  It's certainly atmospheric enough, with fog-shrouded alleyways and convincingly evocative street scenes brought vividly to life by cinematographer, Peter Deming.Most of the performances are first-rate, too, with Johnny Depp a standout as Inspector Frederick Abberline, a real-life detective who, for purposes of the film, is gifted with psychic talents and cursed with a drug problem.  Bedraggled and debauched, Depp drags Abberline through the grim proceedings with intelligence and compassion; he's empathetic with the Whitechapel crowd, but wary, as well.  He looks on the ill-fated prostitutes as fellow human beings fallen on hard times, but their men are something else, entirely.  Vicious, cunning, and altogether amoral, any number of these men rivaled the infamous serial killer in terms of misogyny and violence against women.  Robbie Coltrane is also fine as Abberline's nursemaid/assistant.  Tough and blunt, Coltrane heaves his hulking bulk after the addled Depp, trailing him from murder scene to opium den with the weary acceptance of a loyal manservant; it is Coltrane who gives the movie its true heart.  Ian Holm, as Sir William Gull, physician to the Queen, also gives a finely shaded, elegant performance as a medical man practicing long past his point of retirement.  More problematic, I think, is Heather Graham, a uniquely modern, American actress who, here, attempts to assay the role of a 19th Century London prostitute, and none too successfully.  I like Graham alright, but she's just not a fit with this film.  Her accent isn't convincing, and she just doesn't have the acting chops to carry off the important role of Mary Jane Kelley.  The American actress, Susan Clark, fared better as Mary Kelley in the 1979 film, ""Murder By Decree"", and I think therein lies a big part of the problem that I have with ""From Hell"".  Not Heather Graham's performance, but comparisons with the earlier film.""Murder By Decree"" featured famed fictional sleuth, Sherlock Holmes, and his sidekick, Dr. Watson, frantically chasing around London in an attempt to find, and put a stop to Jack the Ripper's madness.  In this film, Christopher Plummer and James Mason excelled in the roles of the dynamic Holmes and Watson, with Genevieve Bujold, David Hemmings, Donald Sutherland, Sir John Gielgud, and Anthony Quayle rounding out the big-name cast.  While not perfect, ""Murder By Decree"" seems to me to be a more cohesive film, and covers much of the same territory that is retread in ""From Hell"".  In fact, except for the detectives, ""From Hell"" could have been, essentially, a remake.The same could also be said with regards to the 1988 miniseries, which is perhaps, to date, the definitive Jack the Ripper story.

But Ian Holm steals the show, delivering a riveting and chilling performance as Jack the Ripper. He's so good he's scary, and in this movie, he doesn't look at all like a little old man at all. He is truly menacing in the role. Also, the murders aren't well carried out, except for the last one, the murder of Mary Kelley. There, it is so gruesome and violent and depicted with such horror, that it is one of the most well orchestrated killings in movie history!

587460,A1W7JW829H45AE,B00005JKJM,"Charles M. Strnad ""Washed up jock""","[3, 4]","Having watched this 2001 DVD again the other night, and again reading through several of the myriad published histories of The Ripper crimes of 1888 Victorian London, I thought I'd add one MORE perspective on this variably-received movie, now 8 years past its initial release. As a brief background, I (like so many others) have always been fascinated by the crime story, have read a lot (by no means all) of the critical histories (some good, ie: Philip Sugden's materpiece....some acknowledged to be bogus, though entertaining, ie: ""The Diary of Jack the Ripper""), and have seen several of the movie adaptations, of which ""From Hell"" is the most recent, and arguably the most entertaining (my other choice being the 1988 TV miniseries with Michael Caine, which for some reason is STILL not available for USA DVD's).After reading a number of the reviews on this site (which are not unexpectedly quite varied, from one to five stars), I thought I'd offer that what you see/like/enjoy/appreciate in ""From Hell"" is likely mostly what you wanted to see before viewing it- not unlike the Ripper case itself, which still draws a multitude of opinions now 120 years after the fact.First, for those reviewers who didn't find the storyline of ""From Hell"" believable: The published critical histories of the Ripper crimes, including the most critically acclaimed work by Sugden, all at least mention the possibility of the Crown Prince/William Gull/government conspiracy theory, as in the movie- including even the Annie Crook/Crown Prince secret marriage. While not generally considered by most serious historians to be the ""answer"" to the Ripper crimes(Sugden especially provides rather convincing evidence that it is sheer folly), its worth remembering that the real Ripper never was caught, or even close to being conclusively identified (not yet, anyway), so the movie is entitled to its own take, and shouldn't be overly criticized for that alone. It is also rather instructive that the more likely suspects (Montague Druitt, George Chapman, for just two examples) to have been The Ripper (Abberline, in fact, suspected Chapman) wouldn't necessarily make for as entertaining a movie, compared to the always fetching idea that a high government conspiracy is involved. So remember, ""From Hell"" is not a documentary (it IS based on a graphic novel, after all), nor does it intend to be a critical assessment of the published histories and police facts: it's just meant to be entertaining- and at that, I'd argue it succeeds well enough.Lots of criticisms of Heather Graham's choice for the role of the Ripper's final (well, maybe) victim, Mary Kelley, as well as her acting performance in the film. Many criticized how beautiful she is in the film, which is out-of-sorts for an East End London prostitute in 1888. True, but it is also worth noting that all of the histories also point out that of the 5 murdered prostitutes commonly attributed to The Ripper, that Kelley was singularly attractive, including the hair. So the movie chooses to embellish her beauty: so what? For me, since I knew I wasn't watching a documentary, that bit didn't ruin the movie for me- I recognized it for what it was: just another plot device to make the movie ""more viewable"" for most people (though clearly not all). As far as Graham's acting, and so-so accent: again, not deal-breakers for me. It does help to be able to understand the dialogue in a movie, after all- if the cockney accents and slang were taken to the historically accurate extreme, the dialogue might well be nearly unintelligible. So get over it, and enjoy the movie for what it intends to be: entertaining.Comments about the violence portrayed in ""From Hell"" seem to also run the gamut from ""gratuitous"" to ""you got off easy"" (ie: not enough). Read the actual police accounts of the crimes (and the one memorable still photo of Mary Kelley's mutilated corpse at the scene of the crime), and you'll have to agree that the movie was very circumspect and reserved as far as depictions of the actual violence goes. Any movie about The Ripper has to include some images that convey the extreme violence of the crimes, which most investigators concluded increasingly suggested a murderer rapidly losing his sanity altogether. Indeed, one prevailing opinion at the time for why the crimes abruptly stopped after Kelley's murder was that the Ripper's mind had snapped completely, and that he likely committed suicide (the Druitt hypothesis, especially). For me, this movie did a good job of conveying the horror of the crimes, without bathing the viewer in gratuitous violence: but, to each his own, I suppose.I thought the acting performances overall were quite good, though not exactly classics in moviemaking. And again, the real Abberline was neither psychic nor an opium addict, nor was he romantically involved with Kelley- anyone who knows even a little about the history ought to recognize all that as just movie-making- whether you like it or not, it's there to make the story more interesting for some. Personally, I didn't think it added much to the entertainment value of the movie- I'd rather have seen more time devoted to the real Abberline's sleuthing in this case.A lot of comments about the music in ""From Hell""- many found it annoying largely because of it's persistence in every scene. I generally pay quite a bit of attention to musical scores in movies, and some of my favorite flicks typically are marked by their memorable scores. In no way would I call the score in ""From Hell"" memorable, but neither did I find it  annoying, as did so many others. To me, it was another non-factor in my enjoyment of this film.I thought the sets (with modern day Prague simming nicely for Victorian London) were effective at creating an everpresent sense of doom and dread- my wife of 30 years came out of the theatre when we first saw this in 2001 saying that she ""never wanted to watch that movie again"", mainly because the atmosphere was so evil and foreboding that it made her very uneasy throughout. I call that good movie-making, when it affects someone so much.When I ask myself why I only give this movie 4 stars (3 1/2, actually), it's because I was wanting something that stuck a little closer to the known facts- not about who the Ripper might have been, mind you (since that's still fair game to this day), but about the principals involved, especially Abberline's character, and perhaps the prostitutes individually. Perhaps I was also wanting a few more of the possible suspects run by me during the film, just to keep me guessing (as was done in the 1988 TV miniseries).But these are just my hopes/biases before watching ""From Hell"", and not valid criticisms of the movie as it is offered. When considered that way, it largely succeeds, and is worth viewing.",4,What you see is....what you want to see.,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,6823,"['Having', 'watched', '2001', 'DVD', 'again',

Set in Victorian London, it follows an inspector (Depp) as he investigates a series of grisly murders by an unknown villian called ""Jack the Ripper.""Heather Graham co-stars as one of the prostitues being stalked by the Ripper.  Ian Holm co-stars as a royal doctor who assists Depp in his investigation.The murders are done pretty well in the movie and surprisingly, the amount of gore and blood isn't all that bad.  You'll see the flash of a knife, or a quick camera flash of the corpse, but its not over the top at all.Spoiler Alerts:This movie did a good job of capturing the grimy and dark White Chapel neighborhood while contrasting it to the clean and well-lit upper-class areas.  Depp does a good job as the lead investigator, while Graham just does an okay job at being a lowerclass prostitute with obviously dyed red hair.  I did have a hard time buying the romance between Depp and Graham, and I found it amusing that Graham was always clean and looked pure compared to the other prostitutes.  You also never see her conducting the business of the trade; obviously to keep her ""above-board"" for Depp's character.I liked the plot twist as to who Jack the Ripper is, though they could have done a better job explaining why these events happened.  Apparently in the graphic novel, the prostitutes learn early on who the mysterious lover really was (Prince Albert) and plan to extort the Crown, which is what set the chain of events in motion.  That would have been an interesting plot point to see.Anyway, this is a fun movie and you'll enjoy it.

Unfortunately, there is a spoke loose on this wheel in the form of Heather Graham who tries on several accents before finally deciding on an unidentifiable one.The support is excellent, especially from the prostitutes, who blend pathos with humor to a fine degree.  Ian Holm also gives a subtle showing as the queen's doctor, only lapsing into melodrama at the end.Style is definitely more important here than substance.

His has indeed become somewhat of a household name that has withstood the test of time.  The Whitechapel murders, to this day, remain unsolved, and many people find themselves morbidly drawn to this slew of ghastly occurrences.  The Hughes brothers are no different from the countless others who seek to dissect the facts surrounding these heinous crimes, and they approach this fascination with cinematic fervor, creating an excellent movie from the excellent comic book.There have been countless books, movies, and PBS specials produced that delve into the Jack the Ripper tales and theories.  This particular adaptation is the depiction of a detective named Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) who is hot on the trail of the murderous monster.  Enlisting the hallucinatory effects of absinthe, he can induce visions that aid him in his quests.  Throughout his investigation, he gradually begins to fall for one of the Whitechapel prostitutes at risk (Mary Kelly played by Heather Graham), and this serves to up the ante regarding the challenge to find the villain and, furthermore, accelerate his efforts. Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) is a doctor who contributes to Inspector Fred Abberline's profile of the meandering butcher.  Add to this an illegitimate marriage and a royal scandal, and this equates to an enticingly dour, moody thriller that one can't help but to enjoy.The sets on this film are incredible, and included in the two disc edition within the extras existing on the DVD is an intriguing explanation of the recreation of the sets from actual photographs and maps from the period.  The props and attire were also quite well done.  The acting and casting were superb.  The dark lighting created a potently thrilling and disturbing atmosphere, and the excellent cinematography only served to strengthen that sinister ambiance, as well as create an almost overwhelming sense of impending danger.  The blood and gore effects are incredible as well, yet they never take precedence over the story line, which is very much appreciated.  Though fairly predictable, this film is still an exhilarating, if somewhat fictitious, romp through some dreary and obscure pages in history.This movie is a must for fans of horror, true crime, and dark thrillers.  I very highly recommend this film to those with any kind of brooding fascination for the macabre.

Moore is a serious occultist. Even his wikipedia entry says he practices magic and worships a Roman snake diety. He's also very educated on conspiracy related matter so its no wonder that he wrote something like this. Depp does a great job in From Hell. In my opinion he should be acknowledged as one of, if not the, best actors going these days. I was really surprised at how much conspiracy related material made it into a mainstream movie like this. Also how much about Freemasonry got out. Even a reeactment of one of their ""secret"" initiation vows and rituals. But in typical Hollywood fashion they also snuck in a few references where the people on the Police force who knew what was really going on talked about blaming the Jews and using them as scapegoats.I admit that I haven't done a huge amount of research on the Jack the Ripper murders but from what I know it appears to me that there was a Masonic coverup, and there is a lot that points in the direction that they were Masonic ritual murders. As far as the murders being hits ordered by the Queen of England and carried out by Masonic henchman in order to kill off everybody that had had knowledge of a baby allegedly Fathered by the Prince and given birth to by a prostitute I know nothing about any of that although it is pretty much par for the course for the historicly documented pattern of psychopathic behavior of the British monarchy. I'd like to get a hold of copy of Knights book and delve into that theory though. From Hell does show how I believe these super elites use the semi-elites as henchman and discard and eliminate them when the mission is accomplished.

587470,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JKJM,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","As a motion picture, From Hell is quite good.  Just don't look for any truths about Jack the Ripper to emerge from the movie.  While it is based on the Whitechapel murders and does an adequate job presenting some factual information (such as the locations and conditions of the bodies), the premise is based on a thoroughly discredited and rather laughable theory; there is also much fiction in the relationships of the murder victims, and many important events and individuals are ignored altogether.  The film does a decent job of depicting Whitechapel, but it never really comes close to portraying the true filth and miserable conditions of the real Whitechapel, nor does it succeed in revealing the humanity of the unfortunate victims.  Certainly one pities the poor women who must engage in prostitution merely to survive, but the utter hopelessness and darkness of their world does not really manifest itself in the movie.  The portrayals of the murders themselves are quite good and were clearly done with an eye toward accuracy.  I was glad to see that no real attempt was made to show the true state of the final victim's body because nothing can possibly convey the utter horror of that scene.  Johnny Depp is marvelous as Inspector Abberline; Heather Graham is a wonderful Mary Kelly, but her character never really came across as a down and out prostitute.  The characters involved in the murders and conspiracy, whom I will not name for fear of giving something away, are also quite good.  I can accept and even applaud the ""solution"" this movie portrays, as there are a couple of really ingenious aspects of the whole conspiracy, and I felt the ending was quite proper and touchingly subtle.  Needless to say, this is a rather depressing story all the way around.  There is not an overabundance of horror, as the real dirty work of the Ripper is never shown to the audience, so the squeamish can probably make it through until the end with a minimum of head turns.As an armchair Ripperologist, I am compelled to state that the identify of the Ripper and the complex story surrounding the ""solution"" here are not at all historical.  The movie makers took as their premise a thoroughly discredited story, and on top of this they added several completely original ideas.  For example, Inspector Abberline is here portrayed as an opium addict who has visions of the Ripper murders.  The victims supposedly know each other and are marked out for death for a quite specific reason.  All of the juiciest Ripper gossip and wildest speculations are injected into this movie.  For those with little knowledge of the Whitechapel murders, please understand that the murderer, whoever he was, was certainly not the culprit named in this movie.  If you want to learn the history of these crimes, forget almost everything you see here.  This movie is to be enjoyed as a dark, Gothic motion picture because that is all it is.I must say I was disappointed by the bonus material on the accompanying disc.  The documentary about Jack the Ripper is the worst such documentary I have ever seen.  On the one hand, you have someone pointing an amateur camera over Donald Rumbelow's shoulder--often losing the focus as the camera zooms in and out--as he flips through pages of a book of Ripper-related drawings--the most exciting part of this segment is the moment when Rumbelow announces he has to cough and then does so.  On the other hand, you have a fairly old interview of less than stellar quality with a man who asserts that the true facts are those that we see presented in the movie, which is simply untrue and has no evidence upon which to stand.  I was most disappointed by the tour of the murder sites.  Some of the actual murder locations still exist today, and there is in fact a tour offered of the murder sites in modern Whitechapel, but the ""tour"" on the DVD turns out to be a tour of the movie set; the tour guides are the two directors, who make a big joke out of the whole tour and murders.  The deleted scenes are interesting, especially the alternate ending, but I rejoice that such scenes were all deleted because they would have potentially ruined the movie, in my opinion.  Finally, there is an inane 9-minute documentary about absinthe--while Depp's Abberline consumed this dangerous drink as an aid for his visionary powers, absinthe has less than nothing to do with Jack the Ripper.  I'm still giving this DVD four stars because I enjoyed the highly fictionalized movie, but the accompanying DVD really detracts from the overall package.",4,A well-made movie that is more fiction than fact,1025136000,"06 27, 2002",2002,4556,"['motion', 'picture', 'From', 'Hell', 'quite', 'good', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'truths', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'emerge', 'movie', 'based', 'Whitechapel', 'murders', 'adequate', 'job', 'presenting', 'factual', 'information', 'such', 'locations', 'conditions', 'bodies', 'premise', 'based', 'thoroughly', 'discredited', 'rather', 'laughable', 'theory', 'also', 'much', 'fiction', 'relationships', 'murder', 'victims', 'many', 'important', 'events', 'individuals', 'are', 'ignored', 'altogether', 'film', 'decent', 'job', 'depicting', 'Whitechapel', 'never', 'really', 'close', 'portraying', 'true', 'filth', 'miserable', 'conditions', 'real', 'Whitechapel', 'succeed', 'revealing', 'humanity', 'unfortunate', 'victims', 'Certainly', 'one', 'poor', 'women', 'who', 'must', 'engage', 'prostitution', 'merely', 'survive', 'utter', 'hopelessness', 'darkness', 'world', 'not', 'really', 'manifest', 'movie', 'portrayals', 'murders', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'were', 'clearly', 'done', 'eye', 'accuracy', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'real', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'show', 'true', 'state', 'final', 'victim', 'body', 'nothing', 'can', 'possibly', 'convey', 'utter', 'horror', 'scene', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'marvelous', 'Inspector', 'Abberline', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'wonderful', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'character', 'never', 'really', 'came', 'down', 'prostitute', 'characters', 'involved', 'murders', 'conspiracy', 'whom', 'will', 'not', 'name', 'fear', 'giving', 'something', 'away', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'can', 'accept', 'even', 'applaud', 'solution', 'movie', 'are', 'couple', 'really', 'ingenious', 'aspects', 'whole', 'conspiracy', 'felt', 'ending', 'was', 'quite', 'proper', 'touchingly', 'subtle', 'Needless', 'say', 'rather', 'depressing', 'story', 'way', 'around', 'not', 'overabundance', 'horror', 'real', 'dirty', 'work', 'Ripper', 'never', 'shown', 'audience', 'squeamish', 'can', 'probably', 'make', 'end', 'minimum', 'head', 'armchair', 'Ripperologist', 'am', 'compelled', 'state', 'identify', 'Ripper', 'complex', 'story', 'surrounding', 'solution', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'historical', 'movie', 'makers', 'took', 'premise', 'thoroughly', 'discredited', 'story', 'top', 'added', 'several', 'completely', 'original', 'ideas', 'example', 'Inspector', 'Abberline', 'here', 'portrayed', 'opium', 'addict', 'who', 'visions', 'Ripper', 'murders', 'victims', 'supposedly', 'know', 'other', 'are', 'marked', 'out', 'death', 'quite', 'specific', 'reason', 'juiciest', 'Ripper', 'gossip', 'wildest', 'speculations', 'are', 'injected', 'movie', 'little', 'knowledge', 'Whitechapel', 'murders', 'please', 'understand', 'murderer', 'whoever', 'was', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'culprit', 'named', 'movie', 'want', 'learn', 'history', 'crimes', 'forget', 'almost', 'everything', 'see', 'here', 'movie', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'dark', 'Gothic', 'motion', 'picture', 'is.I', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'bonus', 'material', 'accompanying', 'disc', 'documentary', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'worst', 'such', 'documentary', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'someone', 'pointing', 'amateur', 'camera', 'Donald', 'Rumbelow', 'shoulder', 'often', 'losing', 'focus', 'camera', 'zooms', 'out', 'pages', 'book', 'Ripper-related', 'drawings', 'most', 'exciting', 'part', 'segment', 'moment', 'when', 'Rumbelow', 'cough', 'then', 'so', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'fairly', 'old', 'interview', 'less', 'stellar', 'quality', 'man', 'who', 'true', 'facts', 'are', 'see', 'presented', 'movie', 'simply', 'untrue', 'evidence', 'stand', 'was', 'most', 'disappointed', 'tour', 'murder', 'sites', 'actual', 'murder', 'locations', 'still', 'exist', 'today', 'fact', 'tour', 'offered', 'murder', 'modern', 'Whitechapel', 'tour', 'DVD', 'out', 'be', 'tour', 'movie', 'set', 'tour', 'guides', 'are', 'two', 'directors', 'who', 'make', 'big', 'joke', 'whole', 'tour', 'murders', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'interesting', 'especially', 'alternate', 'ending', 'rejoice', 'such', 'scenes', 'were', 'deleted', 'would', 'have', 'potentially', 'ruined', 'movie', 'opinion', 'Finally', 'inane', '9-minute', 'documentary', 'absinthe', 'Depp', 'Abberline', 'consumed', 'dangerous', 'drink', 'aid', 'visionary', 'powers', 'absinthe', 'less', 'nothing', 'do', 'Jack', 'Ripper', ""'m"", 'still', 'giving', 'DVD', 'four', 'stars', 'enjoyed', 'highly', 'fictionalized', 'movie', 'accompanying', 'DVD', 'really', 'overall', 'package']",From Hell

This adds to the overall dark and hopeless tone of this fine film, and ultimately makes Depp's character rather tragic.This is a very stylish, atmospheric film that occurs almost entirely at night on foggy London streets.

I have thoroughly enjoyed him in every part I have seen him in and this movie was not exception.  The movie also featured Ian Holm, no mean actor himself.  The supporting cast was pretty decent and played their parts well.  Secondly, Victorian London was portrayed pretty well, although from all accounts I have read, it was much dirtier than that which was shown in this film.  Third, it did have a few new twists which separated it from others.  They threw the Masonic order in and did a pretty good job of portraying the anti-Semitism which always hung over most European cities at that time.  The story line was plausible if you stretch your imagination a bit.The movie had a few things going against it, as far as I was concerned.  First, it was quite long and drawn out.  This was okay as I watched it at home and was able to take a few breaks.  I would have hated to have sat though this one in a theater.  Secondly, they had some of the most God awful background music I have ever heard.  It almost drove me crazy.  Third, it probably went over the top just a bit with the gratuitous violence.  Now I realize that due to the subject matter; hey, we are talking Jack the Ripper here, that violence was to be expected and was certainly a central theme in this story.  There were just a few too many body parts being shuffled here and there to make it realistic.Was I entertained?  Yes I was.  It just boiled down to the fact that I have been more entertained by other movies in this particular genre, or dealing with this time period.

His character has also been merged with that of Lees the psychic who provided leads in the Ripper case, so now Abberlane has the visions of the ripper's work.There is really nothing new to the storyline - the question of Annie Crook's child, the Prince Edward Albert's involvement with her, and that Jack the Ripper was really a myth to cover up a threat to the morarchy has been brought up in many books, and in the superior MURDER BY DECREE film starring Christopher Plummer, as was The Masonic ritual, the fact nearly all the power people, like Sir Charles Warren, were all Freemasons, the suspicious of Gull being the ripper so there is really nothing new.So, it all comes down to resting on Depp's performance, and being the talent he is, he makes it all worth while.",5,Depp proves he is a powerhouse again!!,1024790400,"06 23, 2002",2002,1201,"['When', 'one', 'body', 'Depp', 'work', 'can', 'not', 'fail', 'be', 'impressed', 'superior', 'acting', 'talent.In', 'basically', 'accurate', 'adaptation', 'play', 'famous', 'Instpector', 'Fred', 'Abberlane', 'heading', 'investigation', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'very', 'astmospheric', 'very', 'grim', 'maybe', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'providing', 'excellent', 'backdrop', 'Depp', 'talents', 'Abberlane', 'version', 'not', 'drunkard', 'drug', 'addict', 'character', 'also', 'been', 'merged', 'Lees', 'psychic', 'who', 'provided', 'leads', 'Ripper', 'case', 'so', 'now', 'Abberlane', 'visions', 'ripper', 'work.There', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'storyline', 'question', 'Annie', 'Crook', 'child', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Albert', 'involvement', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'was', 'really', 'myth', 'cover', 'up', 'threat', 'morarchy', 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'many', 'books', 'superior', 'MURDER', 'BY', 'DECREE', 'film', 'starring', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'was', 'Masonic', 'ritual', 'fact', 'nearly', 'power', 'people', 'Sir', 'Charles', 'Warren', 'were', 'Freemasons', 'suspicious', 'Gull', 'being', 'ripper', 'really', 'nothing', 'new.So', 'down', 'resting', 'Depp', 'performance', 'being', 'talent', 'worth']",From Hell

587485,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005JKJM,D. Litton,"[3, 5]","Those expecting a good scare in the vein of Wes Craven will be sorely disappointed in &quot;From Hell,&quot; the latest take on the infamous Jack the Ripper, done in a style of elegant and yet so perverse that one cannot help but become wrapped up in this dark yet absorbing tale. The latest film from the Hughes Brothers is a gossamer blanket of elegant settings crossed with the depraved regions of the darkest of human thoughts, with inklings of the psychological and conspiracy.The story seems to be aimed more at those who know little about the history of Jack the Ripper, putting a fictional spin on the events leading up to the still-unsolved case involving a series of notorious murders in London's Whitecastle district. In this degraded section of the capital, prostitutes fill the streets, five of which form a tightly knit group of friends. At the center of these women is Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), who will become the love interest to Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), who is assigned to the cases of the murders.Of course, Abberline has more connection to the gruesome events than he wishes. His dreams allow him to foresee the crimes before they happen, a plot point that doesn't quite reach fruition by film's end. His psychological connection to the events is never really capitalized on, and since there is really no need for it, what there is in the film seems out of place.The movie also takes its time to generate some momentum, and some will find the sequence of events boring rather than interesting. This is no a whodunit in the traditional sense: the clues in the beginning are less intriguing than those towards the end, and the action is almost null. I consider this to be one of the film's attributes, taking its time in delivering small clues that will lead to larger ones, while keeping the cheap thrills at a minimum.As the plot progresses, it begins to generate some genuine suspense. From the murder scenes, Abberline begins gathering his physical evidence, from things such as grape branches to the smell of expensive alcohol on the victims' lips. He discovers that the women killed by the Ripper compose the circle of friends to which Mary belongs, making it more of a personal vendetta, a particularly effective angle once the final act begins.This new working of the legendary serial killer is quite a stylish trip, I must say, boasting some of the most impressive visual scenes of this year. Scenes that reveal the glory of London soon transform into the degradation and run-down conditions of the poor sectors, while the murder scenes have the good taste to keep most of the gruesome, gory detail hidden from view. The recreation of London in the 19th century is meticulous and bursting with authenticity, a lavish set and costume design achievement.The underlying mystery also keeps things moving at a reasonable pace, and those who enjoy exposition over thrills will find it rather interesting. It sparks a new twist that involves many of London's highly regarded officials, even a figure of royalty. As the beginning begins to unfold, nothing seems to fit together, but as the story progresses, the pieces become clearer. Most importantly, it keeps its surprises well hidden, making them that much more effective once they are revealed.Johnny Depp is back in fine form, and his performance here is sure to remind audiences of his spectacular acting in Tim Burton's &quot;Sleepy Hollow.&quot; In Abberline, he plays the same kind of character, but with an edgier lifestyle, and a more straightforward attitude. It's good to see Heather Graham in a genre that befits her talent; comedy doesn't seem to be her strong suit, but her role as Mary in this film allows her to give us a wonderful performance. She and Depp share a terrific offbeat chemistry, one that makes the movie's bittersweet resolution for the two deeply affecting.I've never really known much about the legend of Jack the Ripper short of seeing &quot;From Hell,&quot; and even I have my doubts about its historical accuracy in regards to the sequence of events leading to the fictional twist in the end. Even still, the film is bursting with elements of the macabre and the gothic, and carries a well-suited cast to pull off a nicely paced plot; this is a pretty impressive production.",4,Slow-paced yet mesmerizing; Depp and Graham shine.,1004227200,"10 28, 2001",2001,4295,"['expecting', 'good', 'scare', 'vein', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'quot', 'From', 'Hell', 'quot', 'latest', 'take', 'infamous', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'done', 'style', 'elegant', 'yet', 'so', 'perverse', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'become', 'wrapped', 'up', 'dark', 'yet', 'absorbing', 'tale', 'latest', 'film', 'Hughes', 'Brothers', 'gossamer', 'blanket', 'elegant', 'settings', 'crossed', 'depraved', 'regions', 'darkest', 'human', 'thoughts', 'inklings', 'psychological', 'conspiracy.The', 'story', 'be', 'aimed', 'more', 'who', 'know', 'little', 'history', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'putting', 'fictional', 'spin', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'still-unsolved', 'case', 'involving', 'series', 'notorious', 'murders', 'London', 'Whitecastle', 'district', 'degraded', 'section', 'capital', 'prostitutes', 'fill', 'streets', 'five', 'form', 'tightly', 'knit', 'group', 'friends', 'center', 'women', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'love', 'interest', 'Inspector', 'Abberline', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'assigned', 'cases', 'murders.Of', 'course', 'Abberline', 'more', 'connection', 'gruesome', 'events', 'dreams', 'allow', 'foresee', 'crimes', 'happen', 'plot', 'point', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'fruition', 'film', 'end', 'psychological', 'connection', 'events', 'never', 'really', 'capitalized', 'really', 'need', 'what', 'film', 'place.The', 'movie', 'also', 'time', 'generate', 'momentum', 'will', 'find', 'sequence', 'events', 'boring', 'rather', 'interesting', 'whodunit', 'traditional', 'sense', 'clues', 'beginning', 'are', 'less', 'intriguing', 'end', 'action', 'almost', 'null', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'film', 'attributes', 'taking', 'time', 'delivering', 'small', 'clues', 'will', 'lead', 'larger', 'ones', 'keeping', 'cheap', 'minimum.As', 'plot', 'generate', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'murder', 'scenes', 'Abberline', 'gathering', 'physical', 'evidence', 'things', 'such', 'grape', 'branches', 'smell', 'expensive', 'alcohol', 'victims', 'lips', 'women', 'killed', 'Ripper', 'compose', 'circle', 'friends', 'Mary', 'belongs', 'making', 'more', 'personal', 'vendetta', 'particularly', 'effective', 'angle', 'once', 'final', 'act', 'new', 'working', 'legendary', 'serial', 'killer', 'quite', 'stylish', 'trip', 'must', 'say', 'boasting', 'most', 'impressive', 'visual', 'scenes', 'year', 'Scenes', 'reveal', 'glory', 'London', 'soon', 'transform', 'degradation', 'run-down', 'conditions', 'poor', 'sectors', 'murder', 'scenes', 'have', 'good', 'taste', 'keep', 'most', 'gruesome', 'gory', 'detail', 'hidden', 'view', 'recreation', 'London', '19th', 'century', 'meticulous', 'bursting', 'authenticity', 'lavish', 'set', 'costume', 'design', 'achievement.The', 'underlying', 'mystery', 'also', 'things', 'moving', 'reasonable', 'pace', 'who', 'enjoy', 'exposition', 'thrills', 'will', 'find', 'rather', 'interesting', 'new', 'twist', 'many', 'London', 'highly', 'regarded', 'officials', 'even', 'figure', 'royalty', 'beginning', 'unfold', 'nothing', 'fit', 'together', 'story', 'pieces', 'become', 'clearer', 'Most', 'importantly', 'surprises', 'well', 'hidden', 'making', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'are', 'revealed.Johnny', 'Depp', 'back', 'fine', 'form', 'performance', 'here', 'sure', 'remind', 'audiences', 'spectacular', 'acting', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'quot', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow.', 'quot', 'Abberline', 'same', 'kind', 'character', 'edgier', 'lifestyle', 'more', 'straightforward', 'attitude', 'good', 'see', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'genre', 'talent', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'strong', 'suit', 'role', 'Mary', 'film', 'give', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Depp', 'share', 'terrific', 'offbeat', 'chemistry', 'one', 'movie', 'bittersweet', 'resolution', 'two', 'deeply', 'affecting.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'known', 'much', 'legend', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'short', 'seeing', 'quot', 'From', 'Hell', 'quot', 'even', 'have', 'doubts', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'regards', 'sequence', 'events', 'leading', 'fictional', 'twist', 'end', 'Even', 'still', 'film', 'bursting', 'elements', 'macabre', 'gothic', 'well-suited', 'cast', 'pull', 'off', 'nicely', 'paced', 'plot', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'production']",From Hell

Suddenly lost my appetite.  But that's quite all right:  FROM HELL's fascinating story--along with its mercurial cinematography--rapidly overwhelms and consumes all the muck and the gore of London's notorious Whitechapel district of the late 19th Century.Yes, this is (yet) another film about Jack the Ripper, yet it presents the brutal murderer with a most bizarre twist, along with a plot suggesting a motive for the crimes as farfetched as an elephant swimming the Atlantic.  But the zany story works--a story about a small click of Whitechapel prostitutes harboring a secret and subsequently murdered, one by one--in part due to the ingenious visual devices employed by directors Allen and Albert Hughes, and in part due to the spine-tingling acting of Johnny Depp and Ian Holm.  Depp portrays Inspector Fred Abberline, a Scotland Yard detective who, aided by his dependency on opium, laudanum, and absinthe, has an uncanny ability to solve crimes.  Through his drug addiction, Abberline is &quot;chasing the dragon&quot;; when the fragile vulnerability of his character is exposed, the viewer learns the detective is chasing much, much more.Holm plays Sir William Gull, an aging physician of Britain's royal family.  The good doctor is so calm, cold, reserved, detached, and calculating I'll wager he could freeze the mercury on a thermometer.  Holm and Depp easily carry this movie, augmented by haunting images of avarice, brutality, and a less than complimentary portrayal of the freemasons.  FROM HELL is a seat-squirming, stomach-twisting thriller.  And the film gave me an added bonus:  I now have plenty of cold pizza for breakfast.--D.

587487,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00005JKJM,D. Mok,"[2, 3]","Despite all the negative reviews, I really liked this film.  Sure, the material isn't new, but for once it's refreshing to see a story that's so blatantly in the realm of the exploitation film being tackled by A-list talent in Hollywood style.The Hughes brothers have a gift for implementing extremely stylish techniques without seeming show-offy.  The &quot;absinthe&quot; visions in the film as experienced by Johnny Depp's character serve to enhance the mood rather than show off the latest cinematic trick.  The Hugheses do seem fond of extremely graphic violence as seen in Dead Presidents; in From Hell, when a cop says a victim is &quot;in pieces&quot;, the directors show no mercy in sparing you the sight.  However, the highly grisly content has a purpose -- it deprives you of the sense of safety that a &quot;polite&quot; shooting style often yields, and it also blends the two ideas of social decay and aristocratic decadence which both the story and the cinematography express.Depp does a fine job here, though the role of Inspector Abberline isn't exactly his most challenging.  But he is sympathetic and charismatic, projecting intelligence and a troubled psyche.  Heather Graham looks ravishingly beautiful, and I didn't have a huge problem with her accent -- certainly leagues above Julia Roberts' feeble attempt in Michael Collins.  Depp and Graham make for a great pair onscreen, and the screenplay has enough good lines to keep you interested throughout.  Ian Holm does walk off with the film, though, as supra-genius surgeon Sir William Gull.For me, the only truly weak point of the film is the endless scenes with the streetwalkers.  They are a pretty colourful bunch, and there are some highly talented actresses in their midst -- including Katrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp, both of Mike Leigh's Naked, Estelle Skornik, and Susan Lynch, who did a marvellous job in the film Nora.  But the scenes with them are so repetitive that the film's pacing suffers.Small gripe, though -- with amazing lighting and design (including painstakingly accurate recreations of the murder sites), good performances and a nice sense of forward momentum, this film is a good (and lavish) addition to the Jack the Ripper canon.",4,"Grisly, well-made thriller.",1031788800,"09 12, 2002",2002,2230,"['negative', 'reviews', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'Sure', 'material', ""n't"", 'new', 'refreshing', 'see', 'story', 'so', 'blatantly', 'realm', 'exploitation', 'film', 'being', 'tackled', 'A-list', 'talent', 'Hollywood', 'style.The', 'Hughes', 'brothers', 'have', 'gift', 'implementing', 'extremely', 'stylish', 'techniques', 'seeming', 'show-offy', 'quot', 'quot', 'visions', 'film', 'experienced', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'character', 'serve', 'enhance', 'mood', 'rather', 'show', 'off', 'latest', 'cinematic', 'trick', 'Hugheses', 'do', 'seem', 'fond', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'violence', 'seen', 'Dead', 'Presidents', 'From', 'Hell', 'when', 'cop', 'victim', 'quot', 'pieces', 'quot', 'directors', 'show', 'mercy', 'sparing', 'sight', 'However', 'highly', 'grisly', 'content', 'purpose', 'sense', 'safety', 'quot', 'quot', 'shooting', 'style', 'often', 'yields', 'also', 'two', 'ideas', 'social', 'decay', 'aristocratic', 'decadence', 'story', 'cinematography', 'express.Depp', 'fine', 'job', 'here', 'role', 'Inspector', 'Abberline', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'most', 'challenging', 'sympathetic', 'charismatic', 'projecting', 'intelligence', 'troubled', 'psyche', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'ravishingly', 'beautiful', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', 'problem', 'accent', 'certainly', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'Michael', 'Collins', 'Depp', 'Graham', 'make', 'great', 'pair', 'onscreen', 'screenplay', 'enough', 'good', 'lines', 'keep', 'interested', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'walk', 'film', 'though', 'supra-genius', 'surgeon', 'Sir', 'William', 'Gull.For', 'only', 'truly', 'weak', 'point', 'film', 'endless', 'scenes', 'streetwalkers', 'are', 'pretty', 'colourful', 'bunch', 'are', 'highly', 'talented', 'actresses', 'midst', 'including', 'Katrin', 'Cartlidge', 'Lesley', 'Sharp', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'Naked', 'Estelle', 'Skornik', 'Susan', 'Lynch', 'who', 'did', 'marvellous', 'job', 'film', 'Nora', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'repetitive', 'film', 'pacing', 'suffers.Small', 'gripe', 'though', 'amazing', 'lighting', 'design', 'including', 'painstakingly', 'accurate', 'recreations', 'murder', 'sites', 'good', 'performances', 'nice', 'sense', 'forward', 'momentum', 'film', 'good', 'lavish', 'addition', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'canon']",From Hell
587488,AS09CJ2GLNXNV,B00005JKJM,D.N.,"[1, 1]","The cinematography is great, the sets are amazing. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham, the man who plays the henchman 'Medly' and the French girl are miscast and it hurts the film. The Hughes Bros. show little enthusiasm for the film and the script was atrocious, which is a shame with a set like that, someone should have made a damn good film! Every other actor is perfect, I'm not kidding! I especially liked Robbie Coltrane. Just the 'feel' of the movie you get as you watch it, you can almost believe it's real, until Depp or Graham show up. Now, I like Depp, but he was just almost passable in the role. He plays the baby-faced young Abberline, who is a psychic drug-addict. Now, it's not as stupid as it sounds in the film, but it doesn't belong, if he were drinking while touring the sets and getting a feel for the Ripper's stomping ground that would've been better. Graham is way too clean and London's streets would have been full of smog, so much so the public would cover their mouths with handkerchiefs. I love how slow this film can be, it's not typical action/slash. Jack the Ripper isn't even really in this, a goofy gravel-voiced evil guy is and he's boring. The royal conspiracy is only mildly interesting and the possibility of it is nil. They should have focused on the sets and recreating London at that time for an immersive time, maybe it should have been longer? They could have contrasted Merrick with the killer or mentioned that Merrick was a suspect to some unrealistically minded folk. They could have listed more than one idea, or given more time to the police and what they were doing, or how many years had passed with Jack tormenting whores (it felt like 7 weeks in the movie). Also, in a place with about 30, 000 whores, I doubt there would be a friendship between all the victims! The reason the film is called 'From Hell' is that Jack wrote that in some of his letters. Overall, the focus is an Abberline who didn't exist and is actually more dull than the real guy and the prostitutes who have a scary street life but their personal problems and lack of real characterization harm the whole thing.",3,"I like it, though I know it's no good.",1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,2131,"['cinematography', 'great', 'sets', 'are', 'amazing', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'man', 'who', 'henchman', 'French', 'girl', 'are', 'miscast', 'film', 'Hughes', 'Bros.', 'show', 'little', 'enthusiasm', 'film', 'script', 'was', 'atrocious', 'shame', 'set', 'someone', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'damn', 'good', 'film', 'other', 'actor', 'perfect', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'especially', 'liked', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'Just', ""'feel"", 'movie', 'get', 'watch', 'can', 'almost', 'believe', 'real', 'Depp', 'Graham', 'show', 'up', 'Now', 'like', 'Depp', 'was', 'just', 'almost', 'passable', 'role', 'baby-faced', 'young', 'Abberline', 'who', 'psychic', 'drug-addict', 'Now', 'not', 'as', 'stupid', 'film', ""n't"", 'belong', 'were', 'drinking', 'touring', 'sets', 'getting', 'feel', 'Ripper', 'stomping', 'ground', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'Graham', 'way', 'too', 'clean', 'London', 'streets', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'full', 'smog', 'so', 'much', 'public', 'would', 'cover', 'mouths', 'handkerchiefs', 'love', 'how', 'slow', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'typical', 'action/slash', 'Jack', 'Ripper', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'goofy', 'gravel-voiced', 'evil', 'guy', 'boring', 'royal', 'conspiracy', 'only', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'possibility', 'nil', 'should', 'have', 'focused', 'sets', 'recreating', 'London', 'time', 'immersive', 'time', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'could', 'have', 'contrasted', 'Merrick', 'killer', 'mentioned', 'Merrick', 'was', 'suspect', 'unrealistically', 'minded', 'folk', 'could', 'have', 'listed', 'more', 'one', 'idea', 'given', 'more', 'time', 'police', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'how', 'many', 'years', 'had', 'passed', 'Jack', 'tormenting', 'whores', 'felt', '7', 'weeks', 'movie', 'Also', 'place', '30', '000', 'whores', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'friendship', 'victims', 'reason', 'film', 'called', ""'From"", 'Hell', 'Jack', 'wrote', 'letters', 'Overall', 'focus', 'Abberline', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'actually', 'more', 'dull', 'real', 'guy', 'prostitutes', 'who', 'have', 'scary', 'street', 'life', 'personal', 'problems', 'lack', 'real', 'characterization', 'harm', 'whole', 'thing']",From Hell

However, it was a bit sad and disheartening to witness how these women of pulchritude were treated, considering they do provide a popular service to the citizens of London. Yet these are the types of blindlight-rooted cultures which produce the most mindlessly habitually hate-filled hypocrites in such societies.Grapes play a role in the slayings, as each sacrifice was given a single vine of exquisite grapes to consume, along with a vial of some liquor, both of which each woman consumed in tandem with ravenous delight. And that was their final indulgence. They were forthwith dispatched and their disemboweled innards left artfully positioned around the corpses, which would subsequently manifest a theory in which the killer may have been an artist. But this film focuses on the surgeon analogy, with the chief investigator {played by Johnny Depp} ironically quite schooled in the forensic arts, who himself demonstrates his peculiarities such as indulging in the Green Demoness Absinthe, which he meticulously mixes with an amount of six drops of laudanum, a well-known poison, to form an amazing intoxicant alight with the blue flame to fully integrate the ingredients to this forbidden elixir, concocted like an expert Alchemist. He dwells in blissful rapport there in his tub, luxuriously partaking in this ""Alchemist's Delight"".The Phantom of White Chapel strikes again and again, the gleam of his cold blade shimmering in the moonlight, tainted red by crimson life. The figure in black with his top hat and silver-tipped cane disappears into the fog, and the mystery continues.The film derives its nomenclature from a brief letter mailed to the Police station accompanied by a sliver of the woman's kidney, the other half which he happily consumed, and mentioned that it was ""very nice."" Signed, ""From Hell"".Understandable, considering it had been filled with a choice blend of the liquor and grapes, stewed in its own juices. So it was revealed that the killer was also a cannibal. Strains of Hannibal Lechter as well as The Zodiac Killer are influenced here.Another interesting occurrence transpired when someone had left a now infamous message on the wall at one of the bloody scenes:""The jewes {sic} are not the ones that will be blamed for nothing.""So it was both divulged that the perpetrator was a somewhat literate man, and not some savage or Gypsy as was alleged thus far. But this incident also may lead the viewer to consider that message may have been an attempt to redirect attention away from the correct path of inquiry, as well as establish a good bit of aggravation towards the many-times convenient scapegoats that have been Jews. This introduced a religious as well as an aesthetic connotation to divert attention away from the Masons, who were the underground ruling class portrayed by the film; the social elite whose cult was alleged to run England at the time, with its esteemed members merely going through the motions with The Church of England; the politics of enacting mass behavior on the surface in order to maintain positions of leadership while preserving true to one's roots in private.By and by, the clues manifest themselves until eventually, the investigator is face to face with an esteemed doctor he admires, whose delusions of grandeur drove him into the halls of infamy.Overall, a dark production arranged in a cinematic style reminiscent of Coppola, yet not as perfectly hewn. ""From Hell"" is yet another subnote in the legendary of a socio-psychopathic ""madman"" whom some would hail as a genius.",3,A Shadow in The Fog...,1048896000,"03 29, 2003",2003,4527,"['movie', 'view', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'killers', 'infamous', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'slaying', 'White', 'Chapel', 'One', 'being', 'henchman', 'respected', 'doctor', 'who', 'also', 'part', 'ruling', 'Masonic', 'Lodge', 'day', 'who', 'are', 'certain', 'forces', 'inherant', 'certain', 'symbols', 'such', 'Pentagram', 'victims', 'configured', 'symmetry', 'positioning', 'several', 'relics', 'remnants', 'victim', 'therein', 'eventually', 'divulged', 'slayings', 'were', 'committed', 'purposes', 'according', 'particular', 'peculiar', 'purposes', 'believed', 'be', 'incarnation', 'iconoclastic', 'forces', 'would', 'bring', '20th', 'century', 'fruition', 'even', 'Masonic', 'brothers', 'viewed', 'views', 'too', 'extreme', 'ended', 'up', 'condemning', 'lobotomy', 'preferred', 'method', 'treating', 'perceived', 'mentally-ill.We', 'are', 'introduced', 'several', 'prostitutes', 'day', 'filthy', 'dirty', 'crass', 'diseased', 'minimalistic', 'hygiene', 'practices', 'as', 'well', 'teeth', 'However', 'was', 'bit', 'sad', 'disheartening', 'witness', 'how', 'women', 'pulchritude', 'were', 'treated', 'considering', 'do', 'provide', 'popular', 'service', 'citizens', 'London', 'are', 'types', 'blindlight-rooted', 'cultures', 'produce', 'most', 'mindlessly', 'habitually', 'hate-filled', 'hypocrites', 'such', 'societies.Grapes', 'play', 'role', 'slayings', 'sacrifice', 'was', 'given', 'single', 'vine', 'exquisite', 'grapes', 'consume', 'vial', 'liquor', 'woman', 'consumed', 'tandem', 'ravenous', 'delight', 'was', 'final', 'indulgence', 'were', 'forthwith', 'dispatched', 'disemboweled', 'innards', 'left', 'artfully', 'positioned', 'corpses', 'would', 'subsequently', 'manifest', 'theory', 'killer', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'artist', 'film', 'surgeon', 'analogy', 'chief', 'investigator', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'ironically', 'quite', 'schooled', 'forensic', 'arts', 'who', 'peculiarities', 'such', 'indulging', 'Green', 'Demoness', 'Absinthe', 'meticulously', 'amount', 'six', 'drops', 'laudanum', 'well-known', 'poison', 'form', 'amazing', 'intoxicant', 'alight', 'blue', 'flame', 'fully', 'integrate', 'ingredients', 'forbidden', 'elixir', 'concocted', 'expert', 'Alchemist', 'blissful', 'rapport', 'tub', 'luxuriously', 'partaking', 'Alchemist', 'Delight', '.The', 'Phantom', 'White', 'Chapel', 'strikes', 'again', 'again', 'gleam', 'cold', 'blade', 'shimmering', 'moonlight', 'tainted', 'red', 'crimson', 'life', 'figure', 'black', 'top', 'hat', 'silver-tipped', 'cane', 'fog', 'mystery', 'continues.The', 'film', 'nomenclature', 'brief', 'letter', 'mailed', 'Police', 'station', 'accompanied', 'sliver', 'woman', 'kidney', 'other', 'half', 'happily', 'consumed', 'mentioned', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'Signed', 'Hell', '.Understandable', 'considering', 'had', 'been', 'filled', 'choice', 'blend', 'liquor', 'grapes', 'stewed', 'own', 'juices', 'was', 'revealed', 'killer', 'was', 'also', 'cannibal', 'Strains', 'Hannibal', 'Lechter', 'as', 'well', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'are', 'influenced', 'here.Another', 'interesting', 'occurrence', 'transpired', 'when', 'someone', 'had', 'left', 'now', 'infamous', 'message', 'wall', 'one', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'jewes', 'sic', 'are', 'not', 'ones', 'will', 'be', 'blamed', 'nothing', 'was', 'divulged', 'perpetrator', 'was', 'somewhat', 'literate', 'man', 'not', 'savage', 'Gypsy', 'was', 'alleged', 'thus', 'far', 'incident', 'also', 'may', 'lead', 'viewer', 'consider', 'message', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'attempt', 'redirect', 'attention', 'away', 'correct', 'path', 'inquiry', 'as', 'well', 'establish', 'good', 'bit', 'aggravation', 'many-times', 'convenient', 'scapegoats', 'have', 'been', 'Jews', 'introduced', 'religious', 'as', 'well', 'aesthetic', 'connotation', 'divert', 'attention', 'away', 'Masons', 'who', 'were', 'underground', 'ruling', 'class', 'portrayed', 'film', 'social', 'elite', 'cult', 'was', 'alleged', 'run', 'England', 'time', 'esteemed', 'members', 'merely', 'going', 'motions', 'Church', 'England', 'politics', 'enacting', 'mass', 'behavior', 'surface', 'order', 'maintain', 'positions', 'leadership', 'preserving', 'true', 'one', 'roots', 'private.By', 'clues', 'manifest', 'eventually', 'investigator', 'face', 'face', 'esteemed', 'doctor', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'drove', 'halls', 'infamy.Overall', 'dark', 'production', 'arranged', 'cinematic', 'style', 'reminiscent', 'Coppola', 'yet', 'not', 'perfectly', 'Hell', 'yet', 'subnote', 'legendary', 'socio-psychopathic', 'madman', 'whom', 'would', 'hail', 'genius']",From Hell

They aspired to show the seamy underbelly of Victorian London to reveal that it is just as hellish, if not more so, than the urban ghettoes of today.  So, in terms of atmosphere and overall presentation, From Hell is a well-done film.  But as an entertainment, it fails on two main levels.  First, it's predictable.  Like any slasher movie, you know the second one person breaks off from a group that they're going to die very soon thereafter.  And so the suspense drains out at a rapid pace.  The other problem is that the film is just too violent.  The ultraviolent sequences in the film have wincing quality to them.  Generally, you watch them and say to yourself, ""I didn't really need to see that.""  And you don't.  Violence is much more effective when it's implied rather than shown explicitly.The cast is game, with nice turns from Ian Holm (wearing contact lenses much scarier than anything else in the film), Jason Flemyng, and Robbie Coltrane.  But with Johnny Depp doing an addict version of his character from Sleepy Hollow, and Heather Graham as the token girl-who's-way-too-good-looking-to-be-an-actual-prostitute-and-will-be-the-only-one-not-to-die, the leads feel flat.

587496,A2E6LOTVXW8X2P,B00005JKJM,E A Glaser,"[0, 1]","""From Hell"" is an adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name which follows the famous Jack the Ripper murders.  Johnny Depp plays the detective who is trying to catch the murderer, and befriends pristine prostitute Heather Graham along the way.  I believe that there must be more movies about serial killers than actual real life serial killers, but ""From Hell"" manages to put something of a fresh twist on the genre by rooting the Jack the Ripper story in a conspiracy that reaches, as they say, the highest levels of power.The movie does try to recreate the look and feel of London in 1888, and there are a couple of breathtaking panoramic shots over the city, but much of the movie takes place in the pub and nearby street corners where the doomed prostitutes gather.  Somehow, despite the presence of some menacing pimps and the grisly murders that are the subject of the movie, the Victorian slums were not sufficiently violent and filthy.  My uninformed impression is that lower-class London during the Industrial Revolution was even much more dismal than portrayed in ""From Hell"".Speaking of the murders -- I suppose after a long history of serial killer movies which show increasingly graphic scenes of mayhem and gore, a movie like ""From Hell"" has no choice but to follow suit.  The flashing knives and buckets of blood have no power to shock or entertain any more though (for me, at least).  I've come to think that it would be more terrifying to merely imply the violence and leave the details up to the viewer's imagination, but perhaps that was not an option for ""From Hell"", given that part of the Jack the Ripper legend stems from the violent dismemberment of the victims.Johnny Depp's character does have some narcotic-fueled visions about the murders which are good and scary, and there are a few memorable moments as the conspiracy theory is revealed, but the movie still seemed rather too flat and predictable.  (I guess it doesn't help that I knew ahead of time how many prostitutes Jack the Ripper killed.)  I'll be generous and give it three stars, despite my serial-killer-movie-fatigue and my belief that London isn't shown to be nearly squalid enough.",3,"Interesting idea, mediocre presentation",1034208000,"10 10, 2002",2002,2182,"['Hell', 'adaptation', 'graphic', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'famous', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'murders', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'detective', 'who', 'trying', 'catch', 'murderer', 'pristine', 'prostitute', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'way', 'believe', 'must', 'be', 'more', 'movies', 'serial', 'killers', 'actual', 'real', 'life', 'serial', 'killers', 'Hell', 'put', 'something', 'fresh', 'twist', 'genre', 'rooting', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'story', 'conspiracy', 'say', 'highest', 'levels', 'power.The', 'movie', 'try', 'recreate', 'look', 'feel', 'London', '1888', 'are', 'couple', 'breathtaking', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'city', 'much', 'movie', 'place', 'pub', 'nearby', 'street', 'corners', 'where', 'doomed', 'gather', 'Somehow', 'presence', 'menacing', 'pimps', 'grisly', 'murders', 'are', 'subject', 'movie', 'Victorian', 'slums', 'were', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'violent', 'filthy', 'uninformed', 'impression', 'lower-class', 'London', 'Industrial', 'Revolution', 'was', 'even', 'much', 'more', 'dismal', 'portrayed', 'From', 'Hell', '.Speaking', 'murders', 'suppose', 'long', 'history', 'serial', 'killer', 'movies', 'show', 'increasingly', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'mayhem', 'gore', 'movie', 'From', 'Hell', 'choice', 'follow', 'suit', 'flashing', 'knives', 'buckets', 'blood', 'have', 'power', 'shock', 'entertain', 'more', 'least', ""'ve"", 'come', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'terrifying', 'merely', 'imply', 'violence', 'leave', 'details', 'up', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'perhaps', 'was', 'not', 'option', 'From', 'Hell', 'given', 'part', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'legend', 'violent', 'dismemberment', 'victims.Johnny', 'Depp', 'character', 'have', 'narcotic-fueled', 'visions', 'murders', 'are', 'good', 'scary', 'are', 'few', 'memorable', 'moments', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'revealed', 'movie', 'still', 'seemed', 'rather', 'too', 'flat', 'predictable', 'guess', ""n't"", 'help', 'knew', 'ahead', 'time', 'how', 'many', 'prostitutes', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'killed', ""'ll"", 'be', 'generous', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'serial-killer-movie-fatigue', 'belief', 'London', ""n't"", 'shown', 'be', 'nearly', 'squalid', 'enough']",From Hell

Not that knowing the facts ever gets in the way of  the Hollywood version anyway.  Even when they have them, it's still a toss-up as to whether they will be used.  So if you are going to even attempt watching &quot;From Hell&quot;, you have to accept that much of what you'll see is fabrication.With that in mind, I'll only give away that this slant on the story declares that more than one person had knowledge of who was responsible, and in that case, was also responsible themselves.  Believe me, I'm not giving away that much, as it gets a lot more complicated than that.  It's as good a guess as anybody's, so I don't fault them for the direction they chose.  However, I don't buy it because if it went the direction they chose, the mystery would probably have been solved by now.However, the movie does have more going for it, although it is far from a great one.  A lot of effort was made to give the viewer a feel of what it was like to live in those times.  The filthy living conditions of all but the wealthy are covered, although I suspect they were in reality a lot harsher.  The plight of hookers at the time (and yes, the term existed then), is covered, even though you have Heather Graham looking much too gorgeous.  You see that opium use was practiced, but on the other hand, Johnny Depp is so stoned throughout it, you wonder how he gets any work done.

587507,A1X4P6CN08U57A,B00005JKJM,FicktionPhotography,"[0, 0]","First and foremost, this tale of Jack the Ripper was torn from a comic book and not by the whims of historical accuracy.  With that in mind, it isn't half bad.  The story unfolds with the murders of whores that live in the Whitechapel district of London in 1888.  London, at the time, is a growing metropolis with little social decorum as everyone is out for themselves.  As the aristocracy sits pretty in their palaces and homes, the lower classes suffer and women are forced into whoring themselves out for money.  This is where Jack the Ripper comes into play.History describes Jack the Ripper as a malevolent, smart, meticulous serial killer who targeted women who were prostitutes.  He would remove their insides, mainly destroying the uterus, after he killed them.  As the murders continued, his violence to the mutilated victims grew worse and worse.  However, he was never apprehended and so his deeds survived into legend.From that legend, many stories and fanciful tales along with copycats and pop culture survived.  From Hell is based off of a comic book written in the shadow of the legend of Jack the Ripper.  Johnny Depp plays the Inspector while Heather Graham plays the part of Mary Kelly.  Both are based off of the true actions and deeds of their historical characters.  Needless to say, the story has some Hollywood flair of romance and it nearly seethes with similarities between this movie and the Sleepy Hollow tale made movie that Depp also played a main role.This is not for a history buff if s/he is unaware that the movie is based off of a pop culture version of the stories from London's streets.  It also isn't particularly well done in keeping the killer a secret.  Though there are suspicions about the killer being one of the characters, it becomes blindingly obvious near the middle of the movie.Regardless, the movie IS an interesting one, mixing fact with fiction, and it certainly kills two hours of time for those who can stomach a bit of throat slashing fun.  Spending the money on Blu-Ray however?  Maybe not entirely recommended unless you are like me and have a certain affinity for Johnny Depp (or perhaps red heads like Heather Graham in this case).",4,To Remember It's From a Comic,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,2192,"['First', 'foremost', 'tale', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'was', 'torn', 'comic', 'book', 'not', 'whims', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'mind', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'story', 'murders', 'whores', 'live', 'Whitechapel', 'district', 'London', '1888', 'London', 'time', 'growing', 'metropolis', 'little', 'social', 'decorum', 'everyone', 'out', 'aristocracy', 'pretty', 'palaces', 'homes', 'lower', 'classes', 'suffer', 'women', 'are', 'forced', 'whoring', 'out', 'money', 'where', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'play.History', 'describes', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'malevolent', 'smart', 'meticulous', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'targeted', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'prostitutes', 'would', 'remove', 'insides', 'mainly', 'destroying', 'uterus', 'killed', 'murders', 'continued', 'violence', 'mutilated', 'victims', 'grew', 'worse', 'worse', 'However', 'was', 'never', 'apprehended', 'so', 'deeds', 'survived', 'legend.From', 'legend', 'many', 'stories', 'fanciful', 'tales', 'copycats', 'pop', 'culture', 'survived', 'From', 'Hell', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'written', 'shadow', 'legend', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Inspector', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'part', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'are', 'based', 'true', 'actions', 'deeds', 'historical', 'characters', 'Needless', 'say', 'story', 'Hollywood', 'flair', 'romance', 'nearly', 'similarities', 'movie', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'tale', 'made', 'movie', 'Depp', 'also', 'played', 'main', 'role.This', 'not', 'history', 'buff', 's/he', 'unaware', 'movie', 'based', 'pop', 'culture', 'version', 'stories', 'London', 'streets', 'also', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'keeping', 'killer', 'secret', 'are', 'suspicions', 'killer', 'being', 'one', 'characters', 'blindingly', 'obvious', 'middle', 'movie.Regardless', 'movie', 'interesting', 'one', 'mixing', 'fact', 'fiction', 'certainly', 'two', 'hours', 'time', 'who', 'can', 'stomach', 'bit', 'throat', 'slashing', 'fun', 'Spending', 'money', 'Blu-Ray', 'however', 'Maybe', 'not', 'entirely', 'recommended', 'are', 'have', 'certain', 'affinity', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'perhaps', 'red', 'heads', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'case']",From Hell

Instead of staying true to all of the facts, the movie provides some alternative solutions to some of the real life mysteries.  In real life, the identity of the killer was never found, however, the movie provides you with a definite conclusion.  While it isn't completely accurate, it's still enjoyable to see the alternative situations and how it 'might' have been since nothing is truly definite in the real-life tale.The DVD also has many great extras.

They could have belted out &quot;Consider yourself a friend, consider yourself one of the family!&quot;, at the most inappropriate moment, like when Jack slashes them into what could only be described as a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs and I don't believe I would have batted an eye. Just expecting the unexpected. Old Jack's evil legendary status gets a bit tarnished here. It turns out he's a Simon Legree type or something a little more vague, like ancient Druids.

It had good reviews and was talking about an interesting topic. Therefore, I thought that it was going to be a very good movie. Wrong. The movie was interesting and captivating but had a lot of negatives. First of all, Johnny Depp's character was a major drug addict, which I found to be very strange and unnecessary. This degraded his character and made him out as a strange and weird guy.Secondly, the movie wasn't a thriller. No, instead, it was a gorefest. Jack the Ripper is killing prostitutes so the directors are forced to show lots of blood. The movie is very dark and the ending is strange and cruddy. The movie is even too dark at times, such that you can't see anything.The movie is also boring at times as well as even quite confusing at others.Well, I guess that all that it has going for it is the acting but even the acting seems forced with the adopted accents by the prostitutes. Ian Holm and Johnny Depp are good and the score is also descent. When Jack the Ripper is shown, it's pretty neatly and cool made with the steps on his carriage, his top hat and his ""operating tools"".So, as you can see, the movie isn't good and is very disspointing.

At times it is quite gory, but rightfully so.  Jack the Ripper did ritualistically butcher women, and this film does not shy away from it.

587527,A5ZJFVV0564T6,B00005JKJM,"Ilona Novotny ""Eccentric""","[3, 5]","Since childhood, I have been fascinated by Jack the Ripper, probably the first serial killer who shamelessly courted the media and was never caught, a legend in his own time. There have been innumerable books, films, tv shows, plays, and a full-length illustrated book based on the exploits of ""Bloody Jack"". The illustrated book was entitled ""From Hell"", on which this film is based. ""From Hell"" to me is disappointing fare. It's certainly not bad, but it's not very satisfying, either. Which is a shame, because there are many good elements in it. The atmosphere of 1880s London, particularly the seedy Whitechapel district in which the murders took place, has been evocatively recreated. The Hughes brothers took great pains to recreate the murder sites in uncanny detail. Also, little tidbits like paying a small fee to sleep on a rope in a flophouse (several people would lean on a rope and sleep, being too poor to even afford a bed for a night)add to the film's gritty atmosphere. However, the film suffers from too many arty flourishes and heavy-handed attempts at social commentary that diminish the film's power. Yes, there was class, race and religious discrimination in Victorian London, but these subjects are perfunctorily referred to in the film, and then swallowed up by the ""slice and dice"" activities. Inspector Abberline's opium-induced visions of the murders are filmed in a blaring music video fashion that remind the viewer that he is ""watching a movie"", undermining whatever tension and emotional identification one might have with the subject matter. The sequences with ""The Elephant Man"" do not add to the film, either. He's brought in as a colorful curiosity, then disappears just as abruptly, so one wonders, ""Why did they bother?"" A lot of the facts have been inextricably been mixed up with a lot of preposterous rehashed theories, such as the identity of the Ripper (The film draws largely from the 1988 made-for-tv miniseries with Michael Caine), and the ludicrous theory of the Ripper being driven around in an ominous horsedrawn black coach never held much water (or blood)for me. There were never any reports or even suspicions of said coach-this is purely amateur sleuth conjecture. Conspiracy theories abound in this film, a viewpoint that, in my opinion, has worn out its welcome. Why are so many people surprised that the Jack the Ripper was never caught? A lot of murderers are never caught, nor do they have lofty motives-they are simply bloodthirsty! The performances are, for the most part, unremarkable. Johnny Depp is good as the opium-dabbling Inspector Abberline, though the character has been fictionalized to the point of unrecognizability. Depp also looks somewhat out of place historically, along with Heather Graham-they look like escapees from a Kenneth Cole ad. The supporting players look pretty convincing in their Victorian clothes and hairstyles, but Mr. Depp looks like a member of a grunge band, and Ms. Graham, with her Jessica Rabbit hairdo and flawless ivory skin, looks too contemporary and clean-she doesn't even have a symbolic smudge of dirt on her cheek! The other performers, including Ian Holm as Sir William Gull, Queen Victoria's physician, are good, but this isn't a film about characterizations-the roles are pretty much two-dimensional Victorian paper dolls. I think what ultimately disappointed me was the film's viewpoint. It couldn't make up its mind whether it wanted to be an out and out shocker, or a piece of social commentary, rendering it centerless and ultimately unsatisfying.The picture quality and color are beautiful and vivid on this DVD, and the sound is top-notch.

587530,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005JKJM,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","Jack the Ripper has always been a great mystery. No one will ever know who he was and what his motivations were, except if one day we come across new documents. This film is adapted from a comic strip and the theory is original, even if it is not in any way more objective than any other. The idea is that it is a freemason cleaning mission to protect the Prince of Wales who is syphilitic but has married a young prostitute and has had a child from her. The scandal has to be erased and the unacceptable heiress to the throne has to be pushed aside, destroyed, along with all the witnesses of the illegitimate marriage, what's more in a catholic church. The freemasons are moved into this extreme action by several reasons. First to avenge the crime from the catholic church, hence to clean up the plate of dirty linen they have had with the catholic church for centuries. Second, to clean up the social plate this time and get rid of prostitutes, at least some of them, and maybe frighten prospective customers. Prostitutes are seen as propagating diseases and social decay. Third, to strengthen the Crown of England, the Empire, because they have won a very important position in this political institution that more than tolerates them. They also agree with the vast program of this Empire : to civilize the world. Fourth, and this motivation is very obscure, they go back to old traditions and rituals that are supposed to symbolically save the world because they are inspired by God himself, thus projecting the free masons into a cosmological and religious mission : to be the new Abraham, the new Moses, the new messengers of God on earth to propagate his will and ethics. The inspector that tries to find out the truth is a mixture of many characters, particularly Sherlock Holmes, including the use of opium (though Holmes used cocaine), to have visions of the crimes and the criminal. This gives an esoteric dimension to the story. Of course this does not stop the criminal, though the film does pretend the criminal is punished after fulfilling his mission because he over-interpreted the objective of it. The film is well built, entertaining and even thrilling. And I particularly like the use of grapes in this plot. It reveals the deep poverty of many, the condescending pity and rejection of these dregs of society that prostitutes are, the aristocratic belief that these women can be lured by some valueless vain merchandise, etc. The free masons are shown as being a sect, nothing but a sect that tries to manipulate society through their penetrating into the inner circles of the governing body of it. Power is their main objective and they are ready to do anything to protect this power, their power or the power that tolerates them. They are in other words extremely dangerous. This is the modern dimension of this film and it is a disquieting one, because free masons still exist.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,We are under the control of dangerous sects,1081814400,"04 13, 2004",2004,2923,"['Jack', 'Ripper', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'mystery', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'what', 'motivations', 'were', 'one', 'day', 'come', 'new', 'documents', 'film', 'adapted', 'comic', 'strip', 'theory', 'original', 'even', 'not', 'way', 'more', 'objective', 'other', 'idea', 'freemason', 'cleaning', 'mission', 'protect', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'who', 'syphilitic', 'married', 'young', 'prostitute', 'had', 'child', 'scandal', 'be', 'erased', 'unacceptable', 'heiress', 'throne', 'be', 'pushed', 'aside', 'destroyed', 'witnesses', 'illegitimate', 'marriage', 'what', 'more', 'catholic', 'church', 'freemasons', 'are', 'moved', 'extreme', 'action', 'several', 'reasons', 'First', 'avenge', 'crime', 'catholic', 'church', 'hence', 'clean', 'up', 'plate', 'dirty', 'linen', 'have', 'had', 'catholic', 'church', 'centuries', 'Second', 'clean', 'up', 'social', 'plate', 'time', 'get', 'rid', 'prostitutes', 'least', 'maybe', 'frighten', 'prospective', 'customers', 'Prostitutes', 'are', 'seen', 'propagating', 'diseases', 'social', 'decay', 'Third', 'strengthen', 'Crown', 'England', 'Empire', 'have', 'won', 'very', 'important', 'position', 'political', 'institution', 'more', 'also', 'agree', 'vast', 'program', 'Empire', 'civilize', 'world', 'Fourth', 'motivation', 'very', 'obscure', 'go', 'back', 'old', 'traditions', 'rituals', 'are', 'supposed', 'symbolically', 'save', 'world', 'are', 'inspired', 'God', 'thus', 'projecting', 'free', 'masons', 'cosmological', 'religious', 'mission', 'be', 'new', 'Abraham', 'new', 'Moses', 'new', 'messengers', 'God', 'earth', 'propagate', 'will', 'ethics', 'inspector', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'mixture', 'many', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'including', 'use', 'opium', 'Holmes', 'used', 'cocaine', 'have', 'visions', 'crimes', 'criminal', 'esoteric', 'dimension', 'story', 'course', 'not', 'stop', 'criminal', 'film', 'pretend', 'criminal', 'punished', 'fulfilling', 'mission', 'over-interpreted', 'objective', 'film', 'well', 'built', 'entertaining', 'even', 'thrilling', 'particularly', 'use', 'grapes', 'plot', 'deep', 'poverty', 'many', 'condescending', 'pity', 'rejection', 'dregs', 'society', 'prostitutes', 'are', 'aristocratic', 'belief', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'lured', 'valueless', 'vain', 'merchandise', 'etc', 'free', 'masons', 'are', 'shown', 'being', 'sect', 'nothing', 'sect', 'manipulate', 'society', 'penetrating', 'inner', 'circles', 'governing', 'body', 'Power', 'main', 'objective', 'are', 'ready', 'do', 'anything', 'protect', 'power', 'power', 'power', 'are', 'other', 'words', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'modern', 'dimension', 'film', 'disquieting', 'one', 'free', 'masons', 'still', 'exist.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",From Hell
587531,A1G7LCDR6QOF01,B00005JKJM,James See,"[0, 0]","From Hell is an enjoyable, stylish retelling of the Jack the Ripper story.  The focus of the movie is not so much on Jack, though, as on the opium-addicted, absinthe-using Inspector Abberline, who pursues him.  The inspector is played by Johnny Depp, who continues to turn out one brilliant performance after another, even in not so great movies.Not so great?  Well, yes: unfortunately, under all the (admittedly well done) suspense and atmospherics, From Hell is sadly lacking in emotional depth.  The Ripper's mounting body count doesn't seem to elicit the kind of real terror and paranoia that might be expected given the circumstances.  The relationship between Abberline and the prostitute Mary Kelly, played by Heather Graham, is unconvincing and lacks resonance.  This is partly due to ""Roller Girl""'s limitations as an actress, but most of the blame belongs squarely to the script, which just doesn't do enough to develop the story to its fullest.Having said that, there is a lot to like here.  Some of the supporting performances are excellent, notably Robbie Coltrane as a police sergeant and Ian Holm as a high-placed surgeon who helps Abberline grapple with the forensics of the murders.  There are also some nice touches relating to the rigid class divisions of Victorian England.  From Hell is basically an above average suspense thriller, a flawed effort, but more intelligent than most entries in the genre.",3,"Stylish, intriguing, but a little flat",1056153600,"06 21, 2003",2003,1423,"['Hell', 'enjoyable', 'stylish', 'retelling', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'story', 'focus', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Jack', 'though', 'opium-addicted', 'absinthe-using', 'Inspector', 'Abberline', 'who', 'inspector', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'one', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'even', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'movies.Not', 'so', 'great', 'Well', 'yes', 'unfortunately', 'admittedly', 'well', 'done', 'suspense', 'atmospherics', 'From', 'Hell', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'emotional', 'depth', 'Ripper', 'mounting', 'body', 'count', ""n't"", 'seem', 'elicit', 'kind', 'real', 'terror', 'paranoia', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'given', 'circumstances', 'relationship', 'Abberline', 'prostitute', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'played', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'unconvincing', 'resonance', 'partly', 'due', 'Roller', 'Girl', 'limitations', 'actress', 'most', 'blame', 'belongs', 'squarely', 'script', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'enough', 'develop', 'story', 'fullest.Having', 'said', 'lot', 'here', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'notably', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'police', 'sergeant', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'high-placed', 'surgeon', 'who', 'Abberline', 'grapple', 'forensics', 'murders', 'are', 'also', 'nice', 'touches', 'relating', 'rigid', 'class', 'divisions', 'Victorian', 'England', 'From', 'Hell', 'basically', 'above', 'average', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'flawed', 'effort', 'more', 'intelligent', 'most', 'entries', 'genre']",From Hell

587533,A2TBZH06JISZH2,B00005JKJM,JAVG,"[0, 0]","&quot;FROM HELL&quot; is an interesting visual exercise with a rich and haunting musical score. The performances are all very good, though Heather Graham as a whore in 1888 is a hell of a stretch (Heather Graham as a whore in 2001 would be a stretch). Ian Holm is creepily effective as a royal doctor with an agenda. The ending is very wonky, coming out of left field. But for me, having been around long enough to have watched a lot of movies over the last thirty years, I have to say I got a nagging sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.At least one reviewer here has already mentioned the similarity between this film and the 1979 Bob Clark film &quot;MURDER BY DECREE.&quot; The similarities are quite striking.Except for the fact that MBD (made 20 years before the graphic novel FROM HELL was published) had as its detectives Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson (Christopher Plummer and James Mason), &quot;FROM HELL&quot; could qualify as a re-make. Both flicks have: (A) the detectives becoming involved with Mary Kelly while trying to stop her murder, (B) a royal physician involved in a cover-up, (C) the Masons secret order trying to save the monarchy, (D) an illegitimate baby born to the same historic royal suspect in both movies (you even have amazingly similar madhouse scenes in which the detective visits the baby's mother - Genevieve Bujold in the first movie), (E) a psychic who uses laudanum (Donald Sutherland in MBD), (F) a killer transported by coach and - (G) in what may be a visual reference to MBD by the Hughes brothers - the use of oversized black contact lenses in the eyes of the killer at one point in ""FROM HELL"" which is the same technique used to make the killer's eyes scary in MBD. The near-to-final images of both films (by the sea shore) are almost identical. There are probably many other similarities, but it's been a long time since I've seen MBD.""FROM HELL"" is obviously a slicker movie (22 years worth of additional technological advances in filmmaking plus a much, much larger budget) but both it and the 1999 graphic novel on which it is based owe a huge debt of inspiration to ""MURDER BY DECREE"" which for my money is the more entertaining vehicle.

I beg to differ!  I'm a huge horror movie fan, and I almost had to leave the theatre.  The murders start out relatively tame:  a woman is pulled into a dark alley, and we see the glint of a knife as it comes up and down repeatedly.  Not too gross, but definitely effective.  As the film progresses, though, the murders and their aftermaths become more gruesome.  Another victim's body is found disembowled, and little is left to our imaginations at this point.  A third victim's murder is shown to us in graphic detail--a woman is held while her throat is slashed.  Notice how I say slashed and not &quot;cut&quot;--blood spews in every direction.  The next victim's demise is almost just as bad--a shadow seems to step in front of her, and when it leaves, blood is bellowing from her throat.  And the FINAL victim?  Well, if you've ever seen pictures of the real fifth victim, you'll know that the Ripper didn't leave much to be identified here.  And the film doesn't hold back in this depiction of violence.  Perhaps it's not the grossest movie ever made, but in such a realistic environment and tone, the blood and gore seem very horrendous and hard to watch.",3,Not violent?

Most people will tell you that the movie is never as good as nor the same as the book, but I think that as with ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" they can at least attempt to do it justice. I knew that the point of view and overall tone of the story had been changed from the beginning, and I knew that would be difficult for me to overcome, but I gave it the day in court anyway.I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the first two thirds of the movie. While I found the opium smoking amalgamation of Johnny Depps character a lazy creation, I was able to overlook it due to his always outstaning performance. The Hughes brothers took great pains to recreate all the nastiness of Whitechapel and did a decent job at recreating the murders and the further the plot. I was able to overlook the liberties taken with Moore's work and sit back and just enjoy it- at first.Unfortunately I thought the end was a cheesy Hollywood compromise. Even if I hadn't read the book I don't think I would have liked it. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I'll just say I was very disappointed. It was too much of a Hollywood cliche' for something that, up to that point, was really solid work.  What's most disappointing about all of this is that the Hughes brothers really strayed from their normal modus operendi to try something new.

587541,A1XSXUBCNFIM3W,B00005JKJM,Jim Jr,"[0, 0]","To clear up a misconception about the title of the film - &quot;From Hell&quot; is a quote from a letter that Jack The Ripper sent to the police. It is the one letter that most experts agree is actually from the Ripper. This is briefly shown in the film as part of the evidence.The whole idea of the motivation for the killings in this film is not new. There is a film, &quot;Murder By Decree&quot;, about Sherlock Holmes going after the Ripper with the same motivation for the killings as in &quot;From Hell&quot;. The idea that the women killed by Jack were all witnesses to the Roman Catholic marriage of the Prince and prostitute who then produced a child, is the same in both films. Both of the girls end up in an asylum unable to communicate with the outside world. If it were known by the outside world that there was a Catholic heir to the throne of England, it would have torn the country apart. In both films, the Ripper carrying out orders from higher authority. In both there is also a link to the Masons. Perhaps this is not such a fantastic premise. In one of the many books on the actual Ripper, Abberline, the actual detective on the case, is quoted as saying that they did know who the Ripper was, but could do nothing because of who he was.Taking all this into consideration, &quot;From Hell&quot; is an excellent film. The atmosphere of Victorian London is extremely well presented. It might, in other production hands, have turned into a slasher film, but the killings are not that sensational. There are very quick glimses of bodies and quick cuts away from them. They are based on the actual autopsy photos of the victims (and there are existing photos of all the bodies). The acting by all the performers is excellent, not one false note from any of them. The most appealing character is Heather Graham as Mary Kelly, the last of the victims. Her romance with Johnny Depp as Abberline (named after the real person, but not at all like the actual man) is extremely well handled.There are some excellent surprises in the resolution of the story that are extremely plausible leading to a bittersweet ending.A recommendation is to view both this film and the Sherlock Holmes &quot;Murder By Decree&quot;.

587542,A3AFNUPOSK2QGV,B00005JKJM,"Joe Kenney ""buttergun""","[3, 4]","Please note: I'm here reviewing the two-disc ""Director's Limited Edition.""It's hard to believe this movie's almost ten years old; seems like yesterday it was released, but it was filmed in 2001.  Other than the fact that it co-stars Heather Graham (who hasn't co-headlined a major motion picture in quite some time), there's very little about this film which seems dated.  In fact it's probably improved with age.  Staying close to the template of ""Se7en,"" producers-directors the Hughes Brothers adapt Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's graphic novel with aplomb, bringing the late 19th Century to life in all its opium-den decadence.I'm sure a lot of viewers have issues with how this movie strays from the source material, but I prefer to look at it as a wholly separate entity.  And it works well.  In Moore's version the reader quickly knows who Jack the Ripper is, but the Hughes Brothers make this more of a traditional mystery.  The viewer can, however, pretty easily figure out who the murderer is.  You can expect that this film will be violent - any movie about Jack the Ripper would have to be - but it reminded me more of ""Chinatown"" than anything else.  The web of intrigue, period details, and twisted conspiracies are all very well panned out and executed, making this much more than the grisly hackwork it could've become.Acting is good throughout - Johnny Depp is fantastic as usual in his role, as is Heather Graham, though I have to wonder why the producers couldn't at least have gotten an English actress for the role.  The actor playing Jack the Ripper is as malevolent as you could want, and I love the detail of his expanded irises when he's in ""Ripper"" mode, as if he's a demon in human guise.  The Hughes' directing is also stylish and confident - lots of tracking shots and well-done establishing shots which pull you into the sordid world of 1880s London.  I also appreciate how they filmed the gruesome murder scenes, leaving much to the viewer's imagination.  Again, this could've easily become some cheap gorefest, but the Hughes have made it a bit more highbrow, going for a macabre approach that works perfectly for the material.  The things the Ripper did to his victims were unthinkable, and certainly unfilmable - certainly things I'd never want to see in a film, at least.But let's talk about the drugs.  I'm all about the mystique of those Victorian-era opium dens, with the velvet walls and plush rugs and languorous addicts puffing away in contentment.  Depp's character is an opium addict, so we get a few scenes in Chinese-operated dens, and the Hughes brothers bring these places fully to life.  And since Depp's character solves his cases via opium-induced trances, we get a neat tripping scene, complete with worshipful close-ups of an opium pipe being prepared, fired up, and toked.  But the later absinthe scene goes even further, and glorifies drug use moreso than any other  scene in recent film.  Depp prepares a glass of absinthe in the classic ""Prague ritual"" method, with laudanum-dosed sugar cube  placed over a slotted spoon, doused with fire, and then plunged into the drink itself.  This scene about made me want to rush out and buy an overpriced bottle of absinthe.  In fact, I'm still considering it.I'd say this movie is a good purchase, as it is one you could watch at least a few times.  The first viewing you're moreso occupied keeping up with who's who, figuring out who the Ripper is, and piecing together the strands of conspiracy.  And it is an enjoyable movie, despite the subject matter and the numerous prostitute-butcherings.  It even has a somewhat ""happy"" ending that doesn't seem tacked on just to appease the Middle American market.As for the DVD release, the movie is on disc 1 and looks and sounds great.  Disc 1 also features a plethora of deleted scenes, none of which are more than two minutes long.  There are about twenty of them, and they're basically little pieces that either set up scenes or provide more resolution for others.  None of them stand out, and none of them were integral to the movie.  That being said, since none of them are that pertinent, they could've easily been integrated back into the film, which would've truly given us the ""Director's"" edition promised on the cover.  The only incongruous scene is the one that couldn't be integrated back into the film - an alternate ending which is the same as the one in the film itself, only taking place in a different location and a different time.  It's filmed in a gorgeous Shanghai opium den (complete with a gorgeous and nude Chinese woman, about whose rear Hughes expounds upon at length in the optional commentary) and has some of the best shots in the film, but was understandably dropped in favor of the ""real"" ending.Disc 2 features several making-of documentaries, including one about the Moore/Campbell graphic novel, a ""tour of the murder sites"" (which is a tour of the film's set rather than the actual murder locations in London), a ""first look"" documentary hosted by Heather Graham (which features the most annoying camera pans and zooms this side of MTV), and an insider's view into absinthe (which was still illegal when this film was made, but is now legal pretty much everywhere...even here in the US!  Yep, I'm gonna buy that bottle after all.).",4,From Hell: Director's Limited Edition,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,5311,"['Please', 'note', ""'m"", 'here', 'reviewing', 'two-disc', 'Director',

It just wasn't original. A television mini-series with Michael Caine and the 1978 Christopher Plummer-as-Sherlock Holmes feature, ""Murder by Decree,"" drew nearly the exact same conclusions.But ""From Hell"" is a treat for the eyes, dazzling sets, intriguing lighting, mesmerizing flashes of color, moody and, yes, bloody. The gore is not overwhelming or distracting, though.""From Hell"" stands apart from other Ripper flicks in that it is wonderfully stylish, and Johnny Depp adds another convincing portrayal of yet another tormented character to his resume. Thus, I'll give the movie three stars.Give ""From Hell"" credit for its look, but shame on the moviemakers for essentially retelling the ""Murder by Decree"" story 20-some years later and presenting it as if they had a fresh solution to the Ripper mystery.How 'bout a movie with ""From Hell's"" style and the completely shocking ending of ""The Night of the Ripper,"" the 1984 book by Robert Bloch in which the killer is aided by a seemingly sweet woman?

587547,A1HO9J4DCQDGP9,B00005JKJM,"Kali ""bengaligirl""","[10, 14]","Johnny Depp is a versatile actor who puts in an excellent performance as the tormented Police Inspector, Fred Abberline working on the infamous Jack the Ripper case during the reign of Queen Victoria.  Taking many Jack the Ripper legends, the Hughes brothers have created an amazing patchwork quilt of interlinking stories that are drawn together to reveal the identity of a mass murderer who was never bought to justice.  The most famous legend is that the Queen's son and heir to the throne married a commoner, Annie Crook and she bore him a child, and it is this setting that sets the film off on a ride to hell and back.  Abberline doggedly searches for a killer who has taken on mythical qualities, and bit-by-bit he puts together an intricate plot, of royal intrigue and scandal, insanity and corruption in high places.  Not that Abberline is uncorrupted himself, addicted to opium and haunted by the death of his wife in childbirth, he is already half-way to hell himself but redemption comes in the form of Mary Kelly, a beautiful fallen Irish girl who he strives to protect against all odds.  But Abberline is up against the British establishment and the might of Her Majesty's empire, in the guise of Sir Charles Warren played excellently by Ian Richardson and Sir William Gull, Ian Holm at his schizophrenic best.  We are treated to a tour around Victorian London with all its vices from drug taking to rampant prostitution whilst we head for the shattering climax that will reveal everything.  &quot;From Hell&quot; is a film of extraordinary color and vicious vitality.  The camera work is superb and the constant shadowy silhouette of Jack the Ripper gives an eerie feel to an already creepy film.  Blood is aplenty in this film and it is not a movie for the squeamish.  The worst scene is at the end when Jack kills Mary Kelly (there's a little twist here that will amuse those of a dark nature) and Ian Holm just explodes on the screen with the madness of someone on a holy quest for the British Empire.  The lobotomy scene where Annie is driven into madness is also quite disturbing, but there is justice for Annie in an ironic twist at the end of the film.  This movie isn't a horror film though it has horrific qualities.  I do think that many scenes were cut out which I hope will be incorporated onto DVD in the future because I notice from the cast list there are characters we never saw on screen like Annie Crook's parents.  However, despite this minor detail &quot;From Hell&quot; is a truly amazing film, with just enough suspense to make you sit on the edge of your seat, and just enough gore to make you, swallow hard and think &quot;oh gross&quot; before being distracted by another scene that makes you think real hard because of its complexity.  On a final note, Robbie Coltrane is the bomb as Abberline's cynical but good-hearted Sergeant, Peter Godley whose understanding of human nature is understated and truly awesome.  A cast of quality actors all the way through, from the doomed friends of Mary Kelly, through to little Alice Crook, the daughter of the ill-fate Annie and her husband, Albert, aka the future King of England.",5,From Hell....with Love.....,1005436800,"11 11, 2001",2001,3163,"['Johnny', 'Depp', 'versatile', 'actor', 'who', 'excellent', 'performance', 'tormented', 'Police', 'Inspector', 'Fred', 'Abberline', 'working', 'infamous', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'case', 'reign', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'Taking', 'many', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'Hughes', 'brothers', 'have', 'created', 'amazing', 'patchwork', 'quilt', 'interlinking', 'stories', 'are', 'drawn', 'together', 'reveal', 'identity', 'mass', 'murderer', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'bought', 'justice', 'most', 'famous', 'legend', 'Queen', 'son', 'heir', 'throne', 'married', 'commoner', 'Annie', 'Crook', 'bore', 'child', 'setting', 'film', 'off', 'ride', 'hell', 'back', 'Abberline', 'doggedly', 'killer', 'who', 'taken', 'mythical', 'qualities', 'bit-by-bit', 'together', 'intricate', 'plot', 'royal', 'intrigue', 'scandal', 'insanity', 'corruption', 'high', 'places', 'Not', 'Abberline', 'uncorrupted', 'addicted', 'opium', 'haunted', 'death', 'wife', 'childbirth', 'already', 'half-way', 'hell', 'redemption', 'form', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'beautiful', 'fallen', 'Irish', 'girl', 'who', 'protect', 'odds', 'Abberline', 'up', 'British', 'establishment', 'might', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'empire', 'guise', 'Sir', 'Charles', 'Warren', 'played', 'excellently', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'Sir', 'William', 'Gull', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'schizophrenic', 'best', 'are', 'treated', 'tour', 'Victorian', 'London', 'vices', 'drug', 'taking', 'rampant', 'prostitution', 'head', 'shattering', 'climax', 'will', 'reveal', 'everything', 'quot', 'From', 'Hell', 'quot', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'color', 'vicious', 'vitality', 'camera', 'work', 'superb', 'constant', 'shadowy', 'silhouette', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'eerie', 'feel', 'already', 'creepy', 'film', 'Blood', 'aplenty', 'film', 'not', 'movie', 'squeamish', 'worst', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'Jack', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'little', 'twist', 'here', 'will', 'amuse', 'dark', 'nature', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'just', 'screen', 'madness', 'someone', 'holy', 'quest', 'British', 'Empire', 'lobotomy', 'scene', 'where', 'Annie', 'driven', 'madness', 'also', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'justice', 'Annie', 'ironic', 'twist', 'end', 'film', 'movie', ""n't"", 'horror', 'film', 'horrific', 'qualities', 'do', 'think', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'out', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'incorporated', 'DVD', 'future', 'notice', 'cast', 'list', 'are', 'characters', 'never', 'saw', 'screen', 'Annie', 'Crook', 'parents', 'However', 'minor', 'detail', 'quot', 'From', 'Hell', 'quot', 'truly', 'amazing', 'film', 'just', 'enough', 'suspense', 'make', 'sit', 'edge', 'seat', 'just', 'enough', 'gore', 'make', 'swallow', 'hard', 'think', 'quot', 'gross', 'quot', 'being', 'distracted', 'scene', 'think', 'real', 'hard', 'complexity', 'final', 'note', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'bomb', 'Abberline', 'cynical', 'good-hearted', 'Sergeant', 'Peter', 'Godley', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'understated', 'truly', 'awesome', 'cast', 'quality', 'actors', 'way', 'doomed', 'friends', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'little', 'Alice', 'Crook', 'daughter', 'ill-fate', 'Annie', 'husband', 'Albert', 'future', 'King', 'England']",From Hell

587551,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B00005JKJM,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 4]","The bizarre nature of the Jack the Ripper case has evolved into a mystique that captivates minds to this day. Who killed those women? What became of the killer? Though the Ripper case was pretty small potatoes compared to some recent killers, taking the lives of seven women, the perpetrator is recorded as the first celebrity murderer, marking part of the transition to the cynicism of the post-modern era. Directors Albert and Allen Hughes attempt to reflect that transition with the latest film of the case, the self-consciously post-modern ""From Hell.""The title of the movie reflects the return address of a letter received on October 16th, 1888, by Richard Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, claiming to be from the murderer, along with a piece of one victim's kidney. As an example of this movie's excesses, this preserved kidney is shown on-screen, stewing in blood in a box. This image is emblematic of the amount of blood shed before the camera, which is no small part of why this movie fails.Johnny Depp plays Inspector Frederick Abberline, assigned to the investigation of the Ripper murders. Some people may consider this a strike against the movie, owing to Depp's past reputation as a professional heartthrob. However, he has demonstrated a capacity for more sophisticated acting in the past, especially while playing opposite Christopher Walken in ""Nick of Time"" (1995). Dressed in a period costume and speaking in an assumed accent, though, he somehow falls flat.Abberline is depicted as a debauched denizen of London's opium dens. This should serve as a first clue that we have strayed from historicity. The legendary opium dens were primarily found in the book ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood,"" by Charles Dickens. Few actual establishments ever existed, and even fewer lasted any length of time, since the racist police wanted to chase such dirty Oriental influences away as quickly as possible. Abberline is also fond of absinthe and laudanum, which is hinted to be a way of dealing with the traumatic death of his wife. No one ever bothers to speculate as to how a man can use so many narcotics, spend so much time wrapped up in delusions, and still function as a police officer.Jack the Ripper is dropped almost whole in our laps at the beginning of the movie as the first two murders are perpetrated very quickly. Abberline seeks to find the murdered, alongside his partner, Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane), who is semi-corrupt and fond of quoting Shakespeare. They get off to a bad start as they follow a false lead, a protection racket with knife-happy enforcers. The initial time spent on the investigation is spent trying to get prostitute Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) to testify against her harassers.Previews for this movie made much of a supposed romance between Abberline and Kelly. In the actual presentation, however, gives them very little screen time together, and the sudden connection of the two comes without provocation. Shortly thereafter, Kelly disappears from the movie. She is seen briefly outside a small Irish cottage, but once she's out, for all intents and purposes she's out.It's plain that Heather Graham was introduced to the story because she's pretty. Her character contributes no more to the movie than the other prostitutes, yet Graham is billed as one of the stars. She has limited screen time and lank lines. Her inclusion in the movie is an example of the abuse of the star system in movies. If you're going to see ""From Hell"" because you liked Graham in ""Bowfinger"" or ""Austin Powers,"" save your money. She's a drag on this film.The movie is lushly photographed, attempting to capture the degradation of Whitechapel in 1888. Location shots throughout the Czech Republic, where more 19th-Century buildings survive, lend a depth of realism that studio work couldn't reproduce. However, the reality of the environment is interrupted with such modern devices as stop-motion photography, and pans of camera angles that the average Londoner of that day wouldn't have been able to perceive.Some of the shots are marred by a comic-book appearance. This is not surprising, since the movie is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. In the transition from comic to film, however, the Hughes brothers elect to retain many of the visual elements of a comic book. Mixing images creates a very post-modern appearance that doesn't jibe well with the historical origins of the film.Moreover, the plot is too complex. Dragging in issues relating to Freemasonry, venereal disease, Queen Victoria, the Catholic Church, early psychiatry and crude medicine, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and class conflict, the story gallops along at a relentless pace, giving viewers very little time to pause and drink in what they've just seen. The frenetic pace is very tiring. Perhaps the Hughes brothers would have been better served trying to turn this into a TV miniseries. On the other hand, if they'd done that, they couldn't fit in the nudity, drug use, and profound amounts of blood.There have been some very good historical films of the Jack the Ripper case. ""The Lodger"" (1944) comes quickly to mind. This movie, despite the battery of names supporting it, never makes the transition to a movie from the comic book from which it came.",3,Comic Book Villain,1004227200,"10 28,

587553,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B00005JKJM,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[2, 2]","The diversely talented Johnny Depp stars in this Hughes Brothers fictionalization of the story of Jack the Ripper, the prostitute-killing serial murderer of Victorian England. Depp plays Inspector Frederick Abberline, who in real life, was an experienced, thoughtful bulldog of a cop who remained haunted by his inability to solve the Ripper case for the rest of his life.Depp's Abberline is a laudanum-dosing, absinthe-drinking, opium-smoking psychic detective who uses his drug-enhanced visions to solve crimes. He is brought onto the case after the Ripper brutally murders one of the ""circle of friends,"" a group of prostitutes plying their trade in London's Whitechapel area in 1888.The circle of friends, led by Mary Kelly (the irresistible Heather Graham) are privy to a major State secret and are being victimized one after another. Depp tries valiantly to protect Mary Kelly and her friends, though the lures of their lifestyle eventually draw them out back onto the streets to be slaughtered. The real-life Mary Kelly (whom Graham somewhat resembles) was the youngest, prettiest and most vivacious of the Ripper's victims. She was also the worst mutilated, and hence the most kindly treated in the contemporary press.The Hugheses use a variant of the Royal Conspiracy theory to build their story, though historically it is probably untrue that any member of the British Royal House was involved in the Ripper killings, just as the Ripper's victims were most likely not known to each other.FROM HELL (the address line in one of the Ripper's letters) is intensely atmospheric. The sets and cinematography are outstanding. FROM HELL has a powerfully engaging storyline. FROM HELL does as well as any color film could do in setting the mood and tone of Victorian London. Where the story has not been changed for the sake of the plot, FROM HELL is accurate. It is instructive that THE ELEPHANT MAN, which takes place in the same setting in the same year was filmed in black and white. (As a matter of fact, the Elephant Man, John Merrick, makes an appearance in FROM HELL, though no kindly Dr. Treves is in evidence.)Jack the Ripper is identified, a fictionalization which does dilute the story. By identifying the Ripper, the Hughes brothers give some measure of rationality and motive to a person who so clearly had none.The DVD's Special Features are very thin, and consist mostly of incredibly boring deleted scenes along with some very dull commentary by the Hughes Brothers.While the Hugheses generally downplay the sordid aspects of the lives of the Whitechapel prostitutes, and leave much of the gore of the Ripper killings to symbol-laden flashbacks and imagination, they communicate these elements well, nonetheless. However, a colorized version of the actual death scene photograph of the real Mary Kelly is used in a momentary flashback, and it is one of the most hideous images ever to make it into any film. That one human being could butcher another in such a way---so personally---is paralyzing to consider.

587555,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JKJM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[93, 109]","The most important thing you need to know about ""From Hell,"" is that the Hughes Brothers really let you off easy with this one.  When you go home after seeing this movie late at night and have trouble getting to sleep, just remember that they could have shown you a lot more, which means you might not have gotten to sleep for a week.  I have read Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's graphic novel ""From Hell,"" and have also spent some time researching the historical record regarding Jack the Ripper, which includes not only autopsy reports but also photographs of the victims.  Consequently, I was surprised that the film verion of ""From Hell"" actually backed off three times from completely grossing out the audience.First, when the Ripper killed Annie Chapman he draped some of her intestines over her shoulder.  The film does not even suggest this happened, beyond the idea that organs have been removed.  Second, the night the Ripper claimed two victims, most Ripperologists have surmised that because he was interrupted when he killed Liz Stride, he was really angry when he killed Catherine Eddowes, since he hacked away the bottom half of her face.  But when her face is revealed it is just the same as the other victims.  Finally, when the doctor begins to describe the final body--usual the very words of the actual report--he stops after having described the position of the corpse.  More to the point, he stops before describing what Jack did with her organs.  Believe me, you do not need to see this to freak out because just hearing about it would keep you awake all night.  Now, to be fair, the dialogue is the same as that scene in the graphic novel; but then Moore and Campbell had already devoted a entire volume to what Jack the Ripper did that night in graphic detail so it did not have to be articulated.  But I was all set to hear the one of the biggest audience moans in cinematic history and was somewhat disappointed the Hughes Brothers let everybody off the hook.Ironically, the Hughes Brothers could legitimately get away with showing us much more blood and guts.  After all, the autopsy reports tell us in excruciating detail what the Ripper did to each of his victims and they could simply claim historical accuracy.  But instead they pull up short, giving them even more latitude for getting away with what gore they do offer up.  However, during Abberline's vision of what will happen to Jack the Ripper's final victim, one of the images that flashes before our eyes is indeed a photograph taken by the police of the mutilated body of Mary Kelly.  This only goes to reinforce the great divide that exists between those who have studied the murders of Jack the Ripper and/or read ""From Hell"" and those who simply know Jack the Ripper killed a bunch of prostitutes in London in the late 19th century and was never caught.Certainly, the Hughes Brothers do play with us in this film.  If you can stomach seeing it a second time, or if you already know who ""From Hell"" contends is the Ripper, then they are several scenes were Abberline is tantalizingly close to the killer.  Of course, they are not alone in such regard; ""The Bone Collector"" was particularly audacious in offering us a first glimpse of the killer.  Moore and Campbell let us know the identity of Jack from before he ever starts his killing spree, but the movie version decides to keep it a mystery and apparently succeeds in surprising those who only know about ""From Hell"" from the trailer and television commercials.The Hughes Brothers have described ""From Hell"" as a ""ghetto"" film, and certainly the production design stands out in providing a fitting atmosphere for the tale.  The events we are watching are not taking place in the London we have come to know from countless Hammer horror films but in what we readily accept as the city's Whitechapel district in the fall of 1888 (with Prague doubling nicely).  This is as stylish a slasher flick as you will ever see, with the time-lapse sequence of the discovery of one of the bodies and the revelation of the Masonic meeting beneath the streets of London particularly memorable.  Even the lighting works towards the proper atmosphere for the story.Johnny Depp's performance as Inspector Abberline is nicely understated (the character's psychic visions come from a fake psychic who was in the graphic novel).  Unfortunately, Heather Graham is just too darn cute, sticking out from the rest of the totally believable group of prostitutes (Annabelle Apsion, Katrin Cartlidge, Susan Lynch and Lesley Sharp).  I had heard that the producers made actually made them shoot a ""happy ending"" to this film, but fortunately they had the wisdom not to use it.  Ripperologists knew going in that this was not going to be the ""true"" story about Jack, so that additional liberties such as all of the victims hanging out together all the time and the total absence of men in any of their lives, are easily forgivable.  What was always impressive about Moore's tale was how he managed to weave so many different elements together into a comprehensive tale, even if it is ultimately suspect.  But the film version strips the story down to its essentials and while it is certainly the best Jack the Ripper film made to date, I cannot shake my head and think how much better it could have been by letting the audience glimpse just a little bit more of the true story.But, oh, boys and girls, ""From Hell"" could have upset you a whole lot more than it did.

Robbie Coltrane as the sidekick cop Peter Godley was appropriately loyal.  One of the deleted scenes in the library showed a great personal devotion which was a nice touch.

587557,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005JKJM,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 6]","This 2001 film was produced and directed by the Hughes Brothers and based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell.  As you know, graphic novels are actually comic strips and, even though there is no animation in the film, &quot;From Hell&quot; has the look and feel of that kind of exaggeration throughout.In 1888, there were some real and unsolved murders of prostitutes in London by someone nicknamed Jack the Ripper.  That's what this story is based on.  It stars Johnny Depp as the inspector who must solve the case.  He loves to do drugs and in several scenes he's either smoking a pipe in an opium den or cooking up some laudanum at home.  His visions become clues to solving crimes and he's good at his job.The murdered women are always surgically violated and this leads the good inspector to suspect that the murderer knows a lot about human anatomy.  And so he seeks out the medical establishment to help him and we all see more than we ever wanted to know about lobotomies.  The camera doesn't actually focus on details of the murders themselves, but there is so much talk about them and they are described so graphically, that it made me shudder with disgust.There's the search for the killer of course, and there's also a romance between the inspector and a pretty young woman played by Heather Graham who sure could use a few lessons in acting.  Ian Holm is cast as the royal surgeon and, as the plot thickens, one of the suspects is even a member of the royal family.  I found it all quite silly as well as disgusting although I think it captured the spirit of the myth of Victorian England as a harborer of dirty streets and dirty secrets.The film is intoxicating in a way, moved fast, and set up a mystery that was intriguing.

Most of the other movies had started already, and then I saw that ""From Hell"" hadn't yet; all I could remember about it was that it was a period piece, so off I went.Well! It was a Jack the Ripper movie!Now, I used to be rather interested in that case as a lilGal, having read different accounts of the Whitechapel murders and seen a few Ripper movies. One criticism I do have to make is that as things were going along, I had a strange feeling of deja-vu: uh oh, wasn't this sort of lifted from ""Murder by Decree""? Yeah, it was, although no reviewer has commented on that yet. That was when Christopher Plummer's Sherlock Holmes had a go at it, with James Mason as Watson.This time, a Holmes-like Cockney detective played by Johnny Depp is the master sleuth in charge of things. I liked his portrayal a lot. I also liked seeing old vet Ian Holm as a proper Victorian doctor whom Depp consults about certain ""technicalities"".There was, however, a most improbable moment when Detective Depp brings the rather outlandishly dressed prostitute Heather Graham to the Royal Portrait Gallery or some such to make the equivalent of an ID from a mug shot, a full-length portrait of ""you know who"" if you have read enough about this case before. But wouldn't other people have been surprised to see this REALLY shockingly dressed trollop strolling around the museum?

From Hell explores a newer theory that came about in the 1970's, when old documents were discovered.  It is the ""Royal Conspiracy Theory.""  The idea is that Prince Albert had an illegitimate child with a London street prostitute, whom he secretly married.  When the royal house found out, measures were taken to silence her and her whore friends, who were witnesses at the church wedding.  This theory also involves the Stonemasons.Johnny Depp is the best actor in the film.  He plays the opium-addicted - but brilliant - Scotland Yard inspector Adeline.  His co-star Heather Graham falls flat as the whore-target ofthe Ripper.  For starters, her red hair looks so artificial and anachronistic.The filmography, sets, and music are chilling.  Jack the Ripper's carriage, with his goblin-fire green lantern and black horses looks like a coach from Hades.The ending, and the actual revelation of J.T.R. I found more funny than scary.  There were too many close-ups of his face.  He was more scary as a faceless figure in a top hat and cloak.I have heard some say the film is gory.  It is not at all.  I am squeamish, yet I hardly flinched.

In From Hell, the Hughes brothers bring to life the Victorian city and the modern monster that haunted it.  From Hell, like all Ripper lore, is based in fact but filled out by fantasy.  The characters, the Victorian London, the events that unfold are all an odd combination of popular imagination and history.  But in this case the combination works, and neither element overwhelms the other.  The movie is darkly frightening and believable in the willing-suspension-of-disbelief way.Johnny Depp plays Inspector Abberline in a deft, understated performance that fits the setting and skillfully avoids the cliche Scotland Yard caricature.  Heather Graham (not my favorite actress) is remarkable sympathetic and realistic in a performance that bends over backwards to avoid being ""the hooker with the heart of gold"" and usually succeeds.The gore is present but not gratuitous, considering the subject matter.  But to anyone with a weak stomach, there was a reason they called him The Ripper.  The mystery unravels deliberately, skillfully making use of all the early embedded clues so that you can almost guess who the Ripper is... perhaps.  From Hell gives Jack the Ripper's legend its due; it succeeds in melding the modern and Victorian, the true horror and the myth that Jack the Ripper has become seamlessly.",4,Modern/Victorian,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,1403,"['Jack', 'Ripper', 'was', 'first', 'known', 'serial', 'killer', 'modern', 'murderer', 'Victorian', 'world', 'From', 'Hell', 'Hughes', 'brothers', 'bring', 'life', 'Victorian', 'city', 'modern', 'monster', 'haunted', 'From', 'Hell', 'Ripper', 'lore', 'based', 'fact', 'filled', 'out', 'fantasy', 'characters', 'Victorian', 'London', 'events', 'unfold', 'are', 'odd', 'combination', 'popular', 'imagination', 'history', 'case', 'combination', 'element', 'other', 'movie', 'darkly', 'frightening', 'believable', 'willing-suspension-of-disbelief', 'way.Johnny', 'Depp', 'Inspector', 'Abberline', 'deft', 'understated', 'performance', 'setting', 'skillfully', 'cliche', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'caricature', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'not', 'favorite', 'actress', 'remarkable', 'sympathetic', 'realistic', 'performance', 'backwards', 'avoid', 'being', 'hooker', 'heart', 'gold', 'usually', 'succeeds.The', 'gore', 'present', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'anyone', 'weak', 'stomach', 'was', 'reason', 'called', 'Ripper', 'mystery', 'unravels', 'deliberately', 'skillfully', 'making', 'use', 'early', 'embedded', 'clues', 'can', 'almost', 'guess', 'who', 'Ripper', 'perhaps', 'From', 'Hell', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'legend', 'due', 'melding', 'modern', 'Victorian', 'true', 'horror', 'myth', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'become', 'seamlessly']",From Hell

In all probability, they have inspired more speculation and creative work than have all the others combined.  Inspired by a graphic novel series, this effort by the Hughes brothers is another in a long history of productions, each seeking to draw us into the terrors of a century past, leaving us once again chilled and bemused.One of the things that set 'From Hell' apart is its efforts at authenticity.  Costumes, characters and locale are minutely recreated.  We are granted a long glance into the squalid realities of life in places like Whitechapel with very little candy coating.  The conflicts between the bleak lives of London's prostitutes and the posh upper classes underline the fact that whatever the real motivation for the crimes, they were also symptomatic of a deeply divided culture.  Characters like Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) must tread the borders of both realms seeing only the worst that either has to offer.It is only fitting that Abberline is a frequent user of opium who often has 'visions' that show him glimpses of the crimes.  Fitting, because his opponent, the killer also lives in a dream world of his own.  Abberline is a spectator forced to witness the inexorable artwork of the madman, desperately trying to puzzle out the motivations that set his nightmares in motion.  We the onlookers shift out viewpoints from killer, to investigator, to victim, and beyond.  For all that we have more information than Abberline; we come no closer to a solution.Depp gives Abberline a certain fragility that contrasts with both the characters of the prostitutes he is struggling to save (led by Heather Graham as Mary Kelly) and the overwhelming self-confidence of those he serves.  As such he is a bit of a phantom when compared to the likes of Sir William Gull (Ian Holm).  This works quite well given that Abberline's own story can only begin to peak as The Ripper's draws to a close.The film's explanation of the murders is one popular with many Ripper aficionados, and has been used in films before.  The Hughes do find a way to twist this in their own way at the end, providing a bit of a surprise for the most jaded.  While the production has more than its share of the grim and gory, the Hughes rarely indulge in purely gratuitous violence.  Horror, when it comes, is swift and sure.  We are not so much frightened as kept in a state of nervous anticipation.The two discs of this set provide a beneficence of additional materials.  Features about everything from Ripperology to the use of Absinthe.  There is a tour of the recreated Whitechapel and full-length commentaries on the film.

I guess he was just happening by or somink.  Which brings us to the subject of Johnny Depp's accent.While living in Japan I was once informed that a certain other gaijin male was a kind of laughing stock among the Japanese:  though he had learnt to speak fluent Japanese, he had apparently learnt from a woman and so he spoke fluent FEMALE Japanese.  Well, the same thing seems to have happened to Johnny Depp.As to Heather Graham's accent, if I were the directors I would have taken a whip to her:  flogged her mercilessly.  Also, I would have insisted that she prepare for her role as a low-grade prostitute by working as a prostitute for some time.But anyway, so Johnny Depp smokes stuff and somebody else knifes a prostitute in a dark alley.  They roust him out of the opium den in which he is languishing and take him by the scruff of the neck to get a load of a body in the morgue.  HE mumbles words to the effect that yeah, that was the broad he seen in his revery and it becomes clear that being bombed on opium is Inspector Depp's way of solving crimes.The best thing to do, if you are compelled to rent - I mean buy, yes, buy - the film is to freeze-frame it on a shot of Big Ben that comes on about 40 minutes into the picture.

The real ""Jack the Ripper"" was never caught, and that is one of the reasons his story endures.This movie reminded me of the movie ""Tombstone"" with Kurt Russell, or ""Braveheart"" with Mel Gibson, where history had to give way to the drama. There were bits and pieces of history interwoven into the story, but in most of it creative license was taken for a more dramatic effect. We have the same thing in ""From Hell"".The writer(s) pretty much took every theory about the Whitechapel murders and threaded them into the story, giving people a great number of suspects to be suspicious of, and keeping us on our toes until we finally know who the sicko is.The movie is well acted and well shot.

587572,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00005JKJM,Martin Asiner,"[2, 2]","For more than a century, the Western mind has been fascinated with the killing spree of Jack the Ripper that began in London in 1888.  A total of five prostitutes were slaughtered by a knife-wielding fiend who taunted the London constabulary with letters and clues as to his identity.  He was never caught or positively identified.  Many books, short stories, and films have dramatized the events of that brief period when London walked in terror.  The latest entry is FROM HELL, a movie which differs from its predecessors in that the focus is less on the Ripper and more on his victims. Directors Albert and Allen Hughes give the audience a grimy view of the Whitechapel district where the murders occurred.  This rather small section of London was notorious for its filth, prostitutes, street crime, and grinding poverty.  From the opening scene, the Hughes brothers use the camera as the eye of the typical Whitechapel resident. One could not walk a single block without being accosted by whores or derelicts. In the midst of all this squalor, a killer emerged to slice up helpless and hopeless prostitutes.  Police inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) is given the responsibility of catching the Ripper.  As Abberline goes about his business of gathering evidence, the viewer notices that the twin brother directors seem unsure as to whether they want the audience to cringe in fear or to wonder about the Ripper's identity.  This lack of desired audience response eventually becomes intrusive to the point that it interferes with an otherwise tightly controlled plot that builds to a surprise ending involving among other things some unexpected candidates as the Ripper. Recent critics of FROM HELL have criticised Heather Grahame as Mary Kelly, the only attractive prostitute in a circle of rather plain looking ladies of the night.  I see no problem with the physical appearances of any of the victims, since the squalor of their environment was not conducive to frequent beauty treatments.  I did see a problem with the character of Inspector Abberline.  Depp plays him as a semi-mystic drug-addled addict who ultimately is seen as not unlike the very miserable creatures whom he often arrests for petty crimes.  Abberline's opium-induced hallucinogetic visions are inserted more for their pyrotechnic value than for their supposed advantage of providing preternatural clues.  The film does have several strong points.  When Depp is not in a funk of drugs, he exhibits an increasingly deft touch of acting that allows him to register emotions that resonate both with victim and viewer.  Ian Holm as Sir William Gull is effective as the doctor who assists him to catch the Ripper.  But the real hero is neither the fine actors nor the rather unbelievably contrived plot exit.  What makes FROM HELL the memorable cinematic experience that is, is the sullen sense of a grinding background of poverty and social decay that made it possible in the first place for so many poor women to seek their daily bread at the outstreched hands of those who held out coins in one palm but a scalpel in the other.",3,Bloody Jack: New Twist to Old Plot,1030492800,"08 28, 2002",2002,3102,"['more', 'century', 'Western', 'mind', 'been', 'fascinated', 'killing', 'spree', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'began', 'London', '1888', 'total', 'five', 'prostitutes', 'were', 'slaughtered', 'knife-wielding', 'fiend', 'who', 'taunted', 'London', 'constabulary', 'letters', 'clues', 'identity', 'was', 'never', 'caught', 'positively', 'identified', 'Many', 'books', 'short', 'stories', 'films', 'have', 'dramatized', 'events', 'brief', 'period', 'when', 'London', 'walked', 'terror', 'latest', 'entry', 'FROM', 'HELL', 'movie', 'predecessors', 'focus', 'less', 'Ripper', 'more', 'victims', 'Directors', 'Albert', 'Allen', 'Hughes', 'give', 'audience', 'grimy', 'view', 'Whitechapel', 'district', 'where', 'murders', 'occurred', 'rather', 'small', 'section', 'London', 'was', 'notorious', 'filth', 'prostitutes', 'street', 'crime', 'grinding', 'poverty', 'opening', 'scene', 'Hughes', 'brothers', 'use', 'camera', 'eye', 'typical', 'Whitechapel', 'resident', 'One', 'could', 'not', 'walk', 'single', 'block', 'being', 'accosted', 'whores', 'derelicts', 'midst', 'squalor', 'killer', 'emerged', 'slice', 'up', 'helpless', 'hopeless', 'prostitutes', 'Police', 'inspector', 'Abberline', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'given', 'responsibility', 'catching', 'Ripper', 'Abberline', 'business', 'gathering', 'evidence', 'viewer', 'notices', 'twin', 'brother', 'directors', 'seem', 'unsure', 'want', 'audience', 'cringe', 'fear', 'wonder', 'Ripper', 'identity', 'lack', 'desired', 'audience', 'response', 'eventually', 'intrusive', 'point', 'otherwise', 'tightly', 'controlled', 'plot', 'surprise', 'ending', 'involving', 'other', 'things', 'unexpected', 'candidates', 'Ripper', 'Recent', 'critics', 'FROM', 'HELL', 'have', 'criticised', 'Heather', 'Grahame', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'only', 'attractive', 'prostitute', 'circle', 'rather', 'plain', 'looking', 'ladies', 'night', 'see', 'problem', 'physical', 'appearances', 'victims', 'squalor', 'environment', 'was', 'not', 'conducive', 'frequent', 'beauty', 'treatments', 'did', 'see', 'problem', 'character', 'Inspector', 'Abberline', 'Depp', 'semi-mystic', 'drug-addled', 'addict', 'who', 'ultimately', 'seen', 'not', 'very', 'miserable', 'creatures', 'whom', 'often', 'petty', 'crimes', 'Abberline', 'opium-induced', 'hallucinogetic', 'visions', 'are', 'inserted', 'more', 'pyrotechnic', 'value', 'supposed', 'advantage', 'providing', 'preternatural', 'clues', 'film', 'have', 'several', 'strong', 'points', 'When', 'Depp', 'not', 'funk', 'drugs', 'increasingly', 'deft', 'touch', 'acting', 'register', 'emotions', 'resonate', 'victim', 'viewer', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Sir', 'William', 'Gull', 'effective', 'doctor', 'who', 'catch', 'Ripper', 'real', 'hero', 'fine', 'actors', 'rather', 'unbelievably', 'contrived', 'plot', 'exit', 'What', 'FROM', 'HELL', 'memorable', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'sullen', 'sense', 'grinding', 'background', 'poverty', 'social', 'decay', 'made', 'possible', 'first', 'place', 'so', 'many', 'poor', 'women', 'seek', 'daily', 'bread', 'outstreched', 'hands', 'who', 'held', 'out', 'coins', 'one', 'palm', 'scalpel', 'other']",From Hell

What makes the case so fascinating is that the murderer was never caught. Many theories have been put forth as to who the perpetrator was. This film presents its own ideas. They're truly far-fetched, but a stellar performance by Johnny Depp as an inspector assigned to the case, as well as a great set design that captures the London of the time, help to make this a superior version of the gruesome story.Depp's Fred Abberline is an opium-smoking eccentric who has case-solving visions when he is high. This bizarre ability is what keeps him on the police force. Jack the Ripper's targets are street prostitutes. Fred meets and falls in love with one of them, the beautiful Mary Kelly [Heather Graham]. He learns that she and her friends have information that could bring great scandal to some of England's most important people. Could it be information worth killing for?The movie was directed by the Hughes brothers, and it's quite a departure from their previous efforts like ""Menace II Society"" and ""Dead Presidents"". They handle the chills, the thrills and the atmosphere fairly well, although it times it's awkwardly obvious that two very American brothers are directing a very English tale. One of its assets, in my opinion, is that it's not specifically aimed at teens. It's adult enough for someone over twenty-one to enjoy as well.

587576,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JKJM,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[2, 3]","I bought this purely for Johnny Depp, and it did sound like an interesting story. Right at the start, there's a lovely shot of Johnny's eyes, but when you hear people getting stabbed, it's so realistic, and so horrible! Sends shivers up your spine. There are a few familiar faces in this - Lesley Sharpe, Robbie Coltrane &amp; Ian Holm.The soundtrack is quite haunting and creepy, although the bit which really sticks out in my mind, is the heartbeat which appears faintly in the background when Johnny appears on screen, and steadily gets louder. It's a brilliant sound effect to use.The one thing I noticed about Johnny's character (Inspector Fred Abberline) was that he seemed to be reprising his role of Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow. Very similar characters. His English accent is surprisingly good, considering some of the other actors who have tried and failed in the past. (Not naming any names, but Keanu Reeves springs to mind!)There's some lovely shots in this including close ups of Johnny's eyes, a cracking shot of Big Ben against a red sky, and the whole film seems to capture the essence of London in 1888 perfectly.Heather Graham (Mary Kelly) has always annoyed me as an actress, for no particular reason, and I tend to avoid films with her in them. The red hair in this was a big mistake, she's very pale skinned to begin with, and the redness washes her out even more.To begin with, it was hard to work out whether the character played by Robbie Coltrane was superior to Johnny's character. Later we find out that he was a sergeant. He plays the part of a sarcastic, temperamental policeman, a role which he is well known for, and particularly good at.The film is an 18, due to a couple of scenes. The scenes where the `unfortunates' ""livelihood"" is removed, is particularly disgusting, and not a pleasant image to have in your head. You just need to see the reactions in the film to feel nauseous. Also the scene where a girl's throat gets cut is really graphic, and I thought Murron's throat in Braveheart getting cut was bad! This is much, much worse!The ending of this totally threw my opinion of the entire film. Up until then, the film had been good. From Hell is a film about Jack the Ripper, but the Hughes brothers (Coen brothers, Wachowski brothers and now the Hughes brothers!) provided their own solution to the Jack the Ripper mystery. This has been an unproven and unsolved mystery, so I didn't like how they decided to ""solve"" the mystery. It should have been left well alone. It seems like they wanted to wind up the story, so chose any random character to be Jack the Ripper. It doesn't work.This isn't really a horror movie, more a dramatisation, and there was a lack of tension as a thriller. Definitely a must-see for Johnny Depp fans, and people interested in the Jack the Ripper mystery - although the ending doesn't really match the rest of the film. And the ending is also sad!",3,Disjointed,1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,2921,"['bought', 'purely', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'did', 'sound', 'interesting', 'story', 'Right', 'start', 'lovely', 'shot', 'Johnny', 'eyes', 'when', 'hear', 'people', 'getting', 'stabbed', 'so', 'realistic', 'so', 'horrible', 'shivers', 'up', 'spine', 'are', 'few', 'familiar', 'Lesley', 'Sharpe', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'amp', 'Ian', 'Holm.The', 'soundtrack', 'quite', 'haunting', 'creepy', 'bit', 'really', 'out', 'mind', 'heartbeat', 'faintly', 'background', 'when', 'Johnny', 'screen', 'steadily', 'louder', 'brilliant', 'sound', 'effect', 'use.The', 'one', 'thing', 'noticed', 'Johnny', 'character', 'Inspector', 'Fred', 'Abberline', 'was', 'seemed', 'be', 'reprising', 'role', 'Ichabod', 'Crane', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'Very', 'similar', 'characters', 'English', 'accent', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'considering', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'tried', 'failed', 'past', 'Not', 'naming', 'names', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'springs', 'mind', 'lovely', 'shots', 'including', 'close', 'ups', 'Johnny', 'eyes', 'cracking', 'shot', 'Big', 'Ben', 'red', 'sky', 'whole', 'film', 'capture', 'essence', 'London', '1888', 'perfectly.Heather', 'Graham', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'always', 'annoyed', 'actress', 'particular', 'reason', 'tend', 'avoid', 'films', 'red', 'hair', 'was', 'big', 'mistake', 'very', 'pale', 'skinned', 'begin', 'redness', 'out', 'even', 'more.To', 'begin', 'was', 'hard', 'work', 'out', 'character', 'played', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'was', 'superior', 'Johnny', 'character', 'Later', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'sergeant', 'part', 'sarcastic', 'temperamental', 'policeman', 'role', 'well', 'known', 'particularly', 'good', 'at.The', 'film', '18', 'due', 'couple', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'where', 'unfortunates', 'livelihood', 'removed', 'particularly', 'disgusting', 'not', 'pleasant', 'image', 'have', 'head', 'just', 'need', 'see', 'reactions', 'film', 'feel', 'nauseous', 'Also', 'scene', 'where', 'girl', 'throat', 'cut', 'really', 'graphic', 'thought', 'Murron', 'throat', 'Braveheart', 'getting', 'cut', 'was', 'bad', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'ending', 'totally', 'threw', 'opinion', 'entire', 'film', 'then', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'good', 'Hell', 'film', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'Hughes', 'brothers', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'now', 'Hughes', 'brothers', 'provided', 'own', 'solution', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'mystery', 'been', 'unproven', 'unsolved', 'mystery', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'decided', 'solve', 'mystery', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'well', 'alone', 'wanted', 'wind', 'up', 'story', 'so', 'chose', 'random', 'character', 'be', 'Jack', 'Ripper', ""n't"", 'work.This', ""n't"", 'really', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'dramatisation', 'there', 'was', 'lack', 'tension', 'thriller', 'Definitely', 'must-see', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fans', 'people', 'interested', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'mystery', 'ending', ""n't"", 'really', 'match', 'rest', 'film', 'ending', 'also', 'sad']",From Hell

For instance, Prince Edward's character is totally against the historical facts, and I'm surprised the royal family didn't have a hissie fit!But, that aside, what emerges is a taut, somewhat psychedelic look at the heinous crimes of one Jack the Ripper.The direction is good, but at times, there was some difficulty in understanding a lot of the accents.  The art direction and set decoration, costuming, and music are brilliant.  What a horrible vision they painted of Londin the late nineteenth century.I think Johnny Depp has done some really good work, including ""Sleepy Hollow"", but I found him a bit ineffective in this leading role.  His levels were forced, and he never really looked like he was truly in his role.Heather Graham, in spite of her bad accent, still managed to offer a charming aspect to the life she had chosen.  I believed her most of the time, and was impressed with her performance.Ian Holm, as always, was awesome.  This actor has done so much good work over the years, it's hard to see how he has not won an Oscar yet.  Remember him in ""Alien""---wow!  Here, he portrays a retired doctor who offers help to Depp in understanding the Ripper's killings.Robbie Coltrane, also a vastly underrated actor, steals the scenes from Depp.  He conveyed not only his masculine side, but also his sensitive side, particularly in his relationship with Depp.However, to me, the true stars of this movie were the ladies who portrayed the hookers.  None of them were really ""beautiful"" or even ""sexy.""  They looked like a bunch of fishwives done up in tight dresses with bodices exhibiting much cleavage.  But these ladies convinced me of their sordid lives and how much they really didn't like it.  Hats off to Katrin Cartlidge, Susan Lynch, Lesley Sharp, Estelle Kornik, Annabell Apsion, Joanna Page and Samantha Spiro.  They did fine work.

What is it about this story that draws us in?  Evil?  Mystery?  The seemy side of life?  Conspiracy theories?  Maybe.  So many things seem so clear now, while so many things will never be solved today.This movie was just ok, I share no illusions about it being otherwise.  What I would recommend you do is watch the special features with the Jack The Ripper documentary first, then the movie.  The story is rather choppy and tends to bore, plus the people the actors portray are softened up quite a bit to the point where you might actually like them when in real life they probably were not so likable.In the roughneck White Cross district in London during the Victorian age, a few prostitutes are murdered.  Nothing to bat an eye at, as most women involved in prosititution will most likely be the victims of violent crime at some point.  What is odd, as the theories would later project, that all of these women in this particular neighborhood knew each other.  They knew each other fairly well, two were even roommates at one point or another, and they all operated out of the same stretch of street when they picked up their johns.  The theory is that they were being targeted, if you believe the most popular of popular theories, as they were being silenced.  These women were blackmailing the royal family as they were witness to the marriage of one of Queen Victoria's sons to a common woman (formerly of their profession), in a Catholic ceremony, and birth of a potential threat to the royal liniage.The movie, curiously enough, skirts around the fact that all the women, both of the prostitute circle and the mother of baby Alice (the child in question), did not know that the wealthy man she was being kept by was a prince.  They were portrayed moreso as victims, there was never a hint that they were attempting to gain from this knowledge.  The last of the prostitutes in real life was the one most brutally murdered, but in the movie goes off to care for baby Alice in a secluded location far away.  Alice lived a long life and died in the 1950s.  But no one ever seemed to indicated if she was privy to this information or if she lived her life blissfully unaware.

Carnegie,"[0, 0]","There have been so many books, movies and TV shows about Jack The Ripper that you might think that the story had been done to death and that nobody would be interested anymore. However, The Hughes brothers ""From Hell"" proves that there will always be a demand for a quality production of a very grizzly true horror story.Way back in the 19th century (in the fall of 1888 to be precise) one of the worlds first recorded serial killers brutally murdered five prostitutes (yes, only 5) bringing terror to London's east end slums. And whilst in terms of numbers modern serial killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer have been much more prolific, it seems that it is still Jack The Ripper's crimes that continue to still fascinate many people. Is it because of the brutal yet clinical way that the murders were carried out? Or is it because the case remains unsolved? Probably both but as The Hughes brothers, previously best known for the likes of Menace II Society, have set out to prove, that although long dead there are still plenty of `worthy' suspects.Based on the Alan Moore/Eddie Campbell cartoon strip and using the very beautiful city of Prague to expertly recreate Victorian London, The Hughes Brothers' latest movie pitches the clairvoyant, opium partaking, Inspector Fred Abberline (an impressive Johnny Depp), aided by his assistant Peter Godley (the always excellent Robbie Coltrane) racing against time in search of history's most notorious murderer, in this very watchable and very enjoyable yarn. Adapted by screenwriters Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias from the previously mentioned Moore/Campbell source material, From Hell manages to draw everybody from Queen Victoria to Oscar Wilde and the Elephant Man into the plot of this movie, which far from detracting from the true history of the attacks, actually adds a little more depth and a little more zest to this period thriller. To The Hughes brothers credit, this is not just another typical cheap and tasteless Hollywood slasher movie but instead it presents us with the full squalor, poverty and hardship that existed at that time, with the prostitutes presented as poor unfortunate human beings struggling against abject poverty to survive and finding consolation in alcohol. From Hell also boasts excellent performances of depth and subtlety not just from the likes of Depp (complete with a creditable cockney accent), Coltrane (Harry Potter) and renowned British stage actor Sir Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings) but also notably from the likes of (despite a slightly ropey accent) Heather Graham, Lesley Sharp, Annabelle Apsion and the late Katrin Cartlidge (No Man's Land) as the prostitutes earning their living in the squalor that was London's east end.In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed From Hell and would recommend it to anyone looking for something a bit more intelligent, well written and well acted, as an alternative to the traditional horror teen flicks which seem to dominate our movie theatres.

In short, stay away if you only like fluffy violent flicks.The setting is 1888 in London, England. The streets are poor and things desperate. Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) is one of a small group of prostitutes being continuously threatened by the Nichol's Street gang. They want heir cut of the girls profits and refusal means a slice and dice job. Terrified, they turn to their friend who has landed herself a wealthy husband for help. But before the woman can assist, she's grabbed, kidnapped, and lobotomized while her infant is left behind and husband dragged off.Soon a mutilated prostitute's body is found and Detective Fred Abberline, played by the talented and gorgeous horror staple Johnny Depp, is called to investigate alongside his quirky, likable partner. They arrive to find a ""professional"" disembowelment and removal of female organs. Also...grapes. The good inspector has a sort of psychic vision thing going on that pulls forward some pretty bizarre scenarios. His having trouble getting over the death of his beloved in childbirth and also is addicted to opium, called in this movie ""chasing the dragon,"" proves to be interesting.More bodies pop up from the street and Abberline gets together with Kelly to question her about anything she may know. Of course reluctant to talk to the authorities, she takes awhile to warm up, and in the meantime a doctor is called into the picture, an ex-surgeon with a crippling condition who tries and loan his assistance to the police.Between the quick shots of mangled bodies after getting to know the people killed, horrifying experimental lobotomies that render the person helpless for life, the morgue with the funny but overwhelmed mortician and the autopsy details, the turn out blew me away. This movie isn't meant to merely entertain but to unsettle on a deeper level.This particular scripts version is creative and while very far out there is plausible and makes a bizarre type of sense. The deaths become more brutal as it goes along.

I've never read the comic book this flick is based upon, but as a movie fanatic, I could sense prediction and knew what was going to happen. The directors probably concentrated more on gore and splatter (and there are plenty of those) instead of the mystery and the theme that puts the audience into curiousity and left with a big question mark when they leave the cinema. Here we are given the story and the suspect, which we get to find out in this movie (no one ever knew who Jack the Ripper was, as we all know) from their point of view. There are very few scary/tense scenes, except maybe one or two small jump scenes.The movie, however, is very accurate and convincing potraying the streets of England, with low-lives and bums everywhere, blended in with those richer folks, and carriages and the wet and dark alleys and crowdy streets. What saves the movie a bit is the visual: in the beginning we see London with a orange/redish sky marking hell in the horizon. There are stunning details in the movie. The actors (Depp and Graham) do a good job and have convincing Cockney/Scotish accent. The love story is very thin here as well. I won't mention the story and plot, but it is very predictable, EXCEPT the very end, the last scene.In all, this movie isn't too good, with no real feeling of fear and terror, no mystery that should have been left unsolved, no psychological horror (which I think this movie should have been about, of course mixed with the gore and the blood), and no real structure in the love story between Depp and Graham.

I freely admit that the title alone gave me second thoughts about the quality of the film.  However, after seeing this film, I am happy to report that it is, by no means, a bad film.  In fact, I was surprised at how stunningly beautiful it is, even among all the carnage.  Some of the shots of the town at sunset, with a reddish glow surrounding it, simply took my breath away.  Also, the film itself is very stylish in its presentation, to the harsh metallic sound of the stairs to the Ripper's carriage to the use of shadow to the slick feel of the entire story.  The identity of the Ripper, though not surprising, is by no means obvious, so even those adapt at guessing endings will be given a bit of a run.  One of the best aspects of the movie is that it is lengthy, but it does not feel long.  The audience is drawn into the story of Detective Abberline's quest to end the rampage of Jack the Ripper.  The only warning that I would place on this film is that it gets more and more gruesome as it goes on, so it is definately not for the feint of heart or weak of stomach.

587612,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005JKJM,Reviewer,"[14, 15]","The case of Jack the Ripper has long been, and continues to be, one of the great unsolved mysteries of all time, and as such has been the subject of numerous treatments in film.  Of them all, however, none has advanced a more logical or plausible theory in explanation of the who, whys and wherefores of the infamous serial killer than ""From Hell,"" directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, which attempts to solve the mystery that has by consensus long been deemed ""unsolvable.""  But-- cinematically speaking, at any rate-- the Hughes Brothers make a decidedly solid case of it.It's 1888, London; in the Whitechapel district prostitutes are being systematically slaughtered in a precise and grisly manner.  Scotland Yard is at a loss to solve or stop the murders, and Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) is assigned to investigate.  Abberline is somewhat unique in his approach, as he is invested with certain prescient abilities, which he enhances through the use of opium, laudanum and absinthe; not the usual methods employed by the police, but it does effect the desired results.Abberline discovers a link between the victims, and along the way becomes involved with one of the ""girls,"" Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), who may be in danger because of something she knows.  But as Abberline gets closer to a solution, he very well may be in danger also; he knows too much, and there is one, especially, who would find ease if he were to just disappear.  And by any means necessary.The proper atmosphere is, of course, a requirement if one is to tell this story convincingly, and the Hughes Brothers succeed nicely in this regard.  But it would be hard to find a movie about the Ripper that did NOT achieve a proper mood; it's kind of a common link that ties all of the previous offerings together, up to and including this one.  This film differs from the rest in one important respect, however, and it's a big one-- that being the story itself.  Whereas the others are good at leading you down the path and taking you nowhere, the Hughes Brothers go out on a limb and actually deliver a satisfying ending, and moreover, one that solves the mystery.  It's all speculation, of course, but this film will leave you feeling closer to the truth than ever before.  It's well crafted and executed, and they manage to keep the air fairly heavy with menace and suspense, from the beginning right up to the very end, which ultimately defines it as something of a ""fable-noir.""Johnny Depp gives a solid, convincing performance as Abberline, who is something of the antithesis of another of his creations, Constable Ichabod Crane, of Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow.""  It's a challenge for an actor to take on two roles somewhat similar in nature to begin with, and successfully manage to make them quite the opposite of one another in the end, which is what Depp has done with these respective portrayals.  The events surrounding Crane may have been dark, but Ichabod was not; here, however, Deep finds a dark side of his character, Abberline, that is as enigmatic as the case with which he is dealing, and it is that to which Depp plays, approaching from the depths and looking up, rather than observing from a position of light, as he did in ""Hollow.""  And it demonstrates that Depp is endowed with that same kind of chameleon-like quality that serves such actors as De Niro and Billy Bob Thornton so well; it's a matter of being able to transform oneself from the inside out, which comparably few actors can do with any real success.Heather Graham does a good job with her role of Mary; she's convincing for the most part, but there are moments when it's something of a challenge for the viewer to totally believe that she is a ""lady of the night.""  Her appearance seems almost a bit too polished, especially compared to the other girls.  It's a minor complaint, however, as overall, though her performance may not necessarily be one of the strengths of the film, it certainly does nothing to detract from the effectiveness of it.The performance turned in by Ian Holm, on the other hand, is definitely one of the film's strengths.  As Sir William Gull, he is quite believable, with a probing portrayal that does much for the credibility of the story.Also helping things along substantially, are Robbie Coltrane (who has since become known, and will forever after be, ""Harry Potter's"" Hagrid), as Abberline's colleague, Peter Godley, and Susan Lynch (who previously gave such a remarkable performance as Nora Barnacle in ""Nora,"" opposite Ewan McGregor), as Liz Stride.The supporting cast includes Ian Richardson (Sir Charles Warren), Jason Flemyng (Netley), Katrin Cartlidge (Dark Annie), Terence Harvey (Ben Kidney), Paul Rhys (Dr. Ferral) and Lesley Sharp (Kate).  Arguably the best and, without question the most satisfying of all the ""Ripper"" movies, ""From Hell"" is a well made, graphic and thought provoking consideration of the Whitechapel killings, which for quite some time held all of London in the grip of fear and terror.  The conclusions offered here may just be as close to the truth as anyone will ever get; in the event that it is pure fiction, however,it is decidedly good fiction that makes for a couple of hours of riveting entertainment and speculation.  Be forewarned, this one is not going to be for everyone, as many of the mental, as well as visual images it presents are extremely disconcerting.  Definitely not for the squeamish, but for those who are so disposed, this one will prove to be quite an experience.  It's the magic of the movies.",4,Excellent Treatment of An Unsolved Mystery,1026950400,"07 18, 2002",2002,5561,"['case', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'long', 'been', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'unsolved',

587621,A2MJKH6DQIKTM3,B00005JKJM,Robert Amsel,"[1, 2]","On the plus side, the set designer did a splendid job of recreating Whitechapel of the 1880s, as well as the murder sites, based on period photographs and drawings.  The sets and details of the individual crimes have probably never been done better on film.  (I've lived in the East End of London and have seen photos too of the places that no longer exist, and I found the physical recreation truly superb.)  Again on the plus site is Ian Holm's chilling performance, although his changing eye color (from blue to black as he gets nuttier and then back to a pale cataract blue) may be off-putting for some.  On the negative side, the movie was based on a graphic novel that was in turn based on a discredited 1976 ""solution"" to the crimes.  More importantly, the same material concerning the royal link and the Freemasons was done far better the first time around in the 1979 ""Murder by Decree,"" based on the same original source.  Material was also based, at least as far as the ""identity"" of the Ripper, on the 1988 television miniseries, ""Jack the Ripper,"" starring Michael Caine as the detective.  Thus, the ""solution"" was not original and covered no new territory regarding ""Jack the Ripper.""  I also had a problem with some of the quick cuts and choppy scene continuity.  Also, the use of the lobotomy to quiet excitable mental patients was not, to my knowledge, being practiced in 1888, although it seems to be the method of choice in this movie. (If I'm mistaken in this, someone correct me.) As far as the DVD special features, I appreciated seeing Donald Rumbelow, a genuine expert on Jack the Ripper, being interviewed regarding some notable Ripper suspects, but then he is juxtaposed with another author, a quack theorist, who has no authority to recommend him.

I found the premise for this Jack the Ripper film intriguing and smart. The sets portraying  the Victorian era were excellent. That's why I gave it a two instead of a one.

This one did best in the middle. The ending was disappointing and unsatisfying.The romantic aspect of the film was pathetic, the relationship development was millimeter deep.Johnny Depp gave a mixed performance, below his usual quality, probably due to  the script he had to work with.If you are feeling depresed or angry and want to feel more of the same, watch this film.Bottom line, I'm glad I only threw away five bucks on a matinee performance.While most of my reviews are positive, I find that the three or four negative reviews I've written get &quot;not useful&quot; feedback far more than my glowing reviews.

A lot of that goes to the talented group behind this film.  Johnny Depp stars as Inspector Abberline, a London detective whose Opium and Absinthe fueled dreams give him clues to the identity of the brutal killer of prostitutes in the slums of Whitechapel.  But as starts to discover, there are secrets that link these murders together and a conspiracy that goes to the highest levels of power in England.  The performances are solid, including Ian Holm as the Queen's chief surgeon (who has a few secrets of his own), Robbie Coltrane as the Inspector's reluctant partner, and Heather Graham as a prostitute who starts a dangerous relationship with Abberline.  The film was directed by the Hughes Brothers, Albert and Allen (who directed more 20th century oriented fare such as ""Menace II Society"" and ""Dead Presidents"") and based upon the complex and grpahic comic book by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell.  Thanks to cinematographer Peter Deming (Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway) and the stunning production design, this movie makes 19th century London seem as dark and as creepy as the comic does.  While the film doesn't adhear too closely to the book, the graphic detail of the murders and the rather unusual conspiracy angle make this movie a must-see for horror buffs.  The DVD (a two-disc set to be replaced by a single disc by the end of the year) is definitely a must-own for fans of the film.  The lively commentary track feature the Hughes Brothers, Deming, Coltrane, and screenwriter Rafael Yglesias explaining not only the details of the film, but of the actual murders, theories, and some complaints about the studio system that make this an interesting listen.  One the first disc are nearly 20 deleted scenes and an alternate ending that is worth seeing with the optional commentary, if only to hear about an unusual extended shot that is worth questioning.

Rounding it off is the very short ""making of"" special aired on HBO, trailers, and look for a very special Easter Egg in the main menu.

587630,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,B00005JKJM,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[8, 8]","Aside from taking a fresh and unique approach to the old mysteries of Jack The Ripper, From Hell delivers a gracefully languid storyline peppered with brutal killings and interesting musings into an old fashioned culture.Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) has a unique gift, a psychic ability to see murders in his opium dreams.  Because of this talent, he is assigned to the case of a brutally murdered prostitute along with his partner, Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane).  His suspicions turn away from the local gang of pimps and thugs, and towards a more educated and upper-class perpetrator as more and more girls are methodically butchered.Abberline wins the confidence of one of the slightly more refined prostitutes, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), and uses her knowledge of the dead girls to uncover the unlikely murderer.From Hell definitely has its faults, a sometimes weak script and a far-fetched assumption of the identity and background of Jack The Ripper, but makes up for those faults with its stunning visuals and moody atmosphere.Using subtle photography rather than graphical violence in the murder scenes, it leaves a lingering taste in one's mouth that is nonetheless bloody and haunting.Depp plays Abberline with brilliant panache, a man who still cares but is void of the usual emotional swamps most humans swim in, evident in the scene where the coroner is retching but Abberline coldly and methodically examines the mutilated corpse.  I love cold characters.  Heather Graham is a beautiful woman, but not a very good actress.  However, her character of Mary Kelly is probably the best performance she had done, in spite of the weak accent attempted.There are also interesting notes to study while taking in the lush photography, the realism of the opium dens, the early lobotomies performed, a brief presentation of the Elephant Man, along with the cultural notions of the 1880's that well-bred and moneyed people simply could not be capable of such types of brutality.The time frame is well done and interesting in that it also exposes the religious persecution of certain sects, not to mention total disregard for the prostitutes and those poor souls considered to be beneath the genteel societies notice or care.  One's birth class stands out far above their deeds, and propriety rules the day.  And ruling the propriety are a secret sect of Freemasons, answerable only to themselves and powerful enough to stop Abberline's investigation.Perhaps because I am a very visual person I enjoyed the film more than many others did, but I encourage you to look beneath the slow, still waters of the movie's general flow, and pluck out the tasty treats in the form of interesting notes and speculations, and savor them for a bit.  It was really at that point that From Hell went from four to five stars for me.Languid, graceful, gory, suspenseful, atmospheric, and moody, don't miss out on this great sleeper film.

Johnson,"[3, 6]","The first time I learned of the ""true"" identity of Jack the Ripper was from a book by Steven Knight, who I feel is the closest and most viable resource for this elusive killer's identity and facts surrounding the case. The movie adheres to much of Knight's solution and tells the tale in a dark, appropriately frightening fashion. Depp is, as usual, up to the task of portraying Frederick Abberline, lead detective on the case, and one of the few voices of reason (albeit through a haze of either drink or drugs) throughout this melange of criminals, both low and high estate, all the way to Buckingham Palace, who orchestrated this serial killing to maintain the Monarchy and keep it intact for the sake of England, ostensibly. I was not surprised to see that, at the end of the movie, Victoria feels gratitude that ""we"" have been saved, and not to make any further references to this episode...""we"" are most grateful for your discretion in this matter. The implication of the Duke of Clarence, and what happened to his poor wife and child, is well-documented here, and when taken in context of the story and research that went into this production, one feels convinced that indeed, this is what happened and why. Ian Holm is wonderful in his role of Sir Wm. Gull, physician to the Queen, and the architect of the plan which she was entirely aware of from the ineception of same, and bore out my own feelings with respect to how much she played a part in these killings. Great atmosphere and really presents a window into Vicotrian London and the plight of the East End, and the tragic lives these women led, all very well-represented here.

Neither film is perfect, but both are passable movies if you have a general taste for the genre.Characterizations are cardboard as you may imagine. Whitechapel prostitutes were all apparently pretty, clear-skinned young women with hearts of gold. Fred Abberline was an opium addict who committed suicide after the Ripper murders (p.s. he wasn't, and he didn't -- he lived until 1929). Johnny Depp, fine actor though he is, was hilariously miscast in this film -- about 20 years too young to begin with.Also, why do all American actors playing British characters feel they need to put on awful cockney accents? The real Abberline was born in Dorset and would likely not have the irksome &quot;ullo guvnor&quot; accent. Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) was born in Ireland, raised in Wales and did not move to London until the age of 21.Leaving aside the horde of factual errors, this was really a rather dull film. Far too long, overly melodramatic, and quite ridiculous in parts (the romance between Abberline and Mary Kelly, for example).Interested in Jack the Ripper?

He has visions of crimes that he tries to suppress or embrace, depending on his mood, with drugs such as opium, laudanum and absinthe.  Luckily, he has Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane) to help keep him on task.  It is the sergeant who takes Inspector Abberline out to the scene of the first victim in the notorious Whitechapel district of 1888 London.  Most of the investigators believe that the slain prostitute is nothing to worry about and not unusual at all given her profession.  But Inspector Abberline notices some unusual things about the corpse, like the surgeon-like precision of the wounds and the expensive cluster of grapes near her hand.  How could a prostitute afford grapes and what kind of client would have hated her enough to do this?As Inspector Abberline looks into the murder, he comes across Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), a prostitute who knew the victim and is convinced that the local boss is trying to scare them into paying what they owe.  But Abberline doesn't think it is that simple.  As he spends more time with Mary, he comes to discover that the first prostitute who disappeared left a daughter and that she was no longer working the streets, but had found a special man, an artist, who loved her and was taking care of her.  Mary convinces the inspector to find her and Abberline does, but she is in an insane asylum and seems to have the mind of a child.  Abberline turns to the noted ex-surgeon Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) to explain the procedure that made her so and to help give him insights on how a surgeon would have used the tools of his trade on the murdered prostitute.  The more Inspector Abberline delves into the seemingly unrelated stories, the more he is convinced that they are linked.  So when Abberline discovers that the artist lover is in fact the Prince, he suddenly comes to realize that the prostitutes who are being murdered all have one thing in common....This was a very intriguing look at the Jack the Ripper tale with an interesting premise and solution to the seemingly unsolvable and random crimes.  The directors did a wonderful job at creating a very dark and creepy atmosphere on the film that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat even when there is nothing scary going on.  I also liked their artful visions of the murders and their restraint in showing or not showing details and leaving it up to the viewers imagination to fill in the blanks.  Johnny Depp was superb in his role as Inspector Abberline, as he always is, and you found yourself cheering him on and wishing him every happiness, yet knowing that he wouldn't allow himself to be happy.  Heather Graham was quite convincing in her role as a poor British prostitute, but her accent was not quite right.  However, it is Ian Holm who really fools the viewers and keeps you in suspense as his character rapidly unravels at the end of the film.

The high concepts and rock and roll video treatments can be forgiven if for no other reason than to savor the ghastly atmosphere and psycho-sexual elements that were (and currently still can be in a major release) used to convey some sort of realistic horror.Despite some reviewers quibbling about historic details this version goes way beyond the norm to present characters and sets very much like their historical inspirations. So what if all the prostitutes didn't actually know each other (though some of them knew of each other) their names, their sequence of murders, the places and buildings, even the wounds were all quite accurate.

587641,AGRR05FH945HR,B00005JKJM,Steven Cain,"[1, 1]","A classy movie, with a very talented cast, headed by the always-superb Depp. So why only four stars? Well, like some other viewers, I felt that it lacked that final something to make it an irresistible movie.Perhaps the one thing that made me skeptical from early on is the way the film followed the Masonic Conspiracy Theory set out by Stephen Knight in Jack The Ripper: The Final Solution. Without giving anything away,  the Ripper that Depp uncovers - a real-life person of the time - was believed to have been geographically excluded from the possible suspect list, in that for one or more of the murders, he was nowhere near London, let alone Whitechapel.Curiously, the movie doesn't make much of the 'From Hell' letter that gave the film its name. This letter, written in blood-like red ink, was believed to have been one of only two letters that may have been sent by the Ripper - all the rest being hoaxes.The actresses who played the prostitutes were simply magnificent, which created a human aspect to the drama that was essential to involving the viewer. What happened to those women was unforgivable and the movie succeeds in making the point that they were innocent victims of circumstance, who only followed their 'profession' out of poverty and desperation.The psychic element whereby Depp's Abberline can 'see' some of the murder details is a very interesting feature and lifts From Hell onto another level.As far as the Catholic prostitute carrying a Royal baby theory goes, there have been so many illegitimate children to royalty over the centuries that such an event need not have been enough to trigger such a systematic campaign of brutality. Even given that the Prince allegedly 'married' the Catholic prostitute in an apparently legal ceremony with 5 ... witnesses, needn't have been much of a cause for concern.Remember, in those days, the Government was all-powerful and any official denial backed by the mere threat of extermination would have been enough to take care of any attempt to exploit the situation via the Press.Who was the Ripper? Either a totally unknown local man, who had worked as a porter in the morgue of a teaching hospital, or somebody acting as part of a Conspiracy group. But not driven by something so mundane as a royal baby. Yet perhaps involving a bloodline infinitely more precious and therefore dangerous. A sacred bloodline, a holy bloodline. And MARY Kelly did get away. Now that would make a more original plot twist.A trifle unimaginative, but this is still a great movie and well worth the typically excellent Amazon.com price.",4,"Five for Heaven, five for Hell...",1058313600,"07 16, 2003",2003,2587,"['classy', 'movie', 'very', 'talented', 'cast', 'headed', 'always-superb', 'Depp', 'So', 'why', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'Well', 'other', 'viewers', 'felt', 'lacked', 'final', 'something', 'make', 'irresistible', 'movie.Perhaps', 'one', 'thing', 'made', 'skeptical', 'early', 'way', 'film', 'followed', 'Masonic', 'Conspiracy', 'Theory', 'set', 'out', 'Stephen', 'Knight', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'Final', 'Solution', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'Ripper', 'Depp', 'uncovers', 'real-life', 'person', 'time', 'was', 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'geographically', 'excluded', 'possible', 'suspect', 'list', 'one', 'more', 'murders', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'London', 'let', 'alone', 'Whitechapel.Curiously', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', ""'From"", 'Hell', 'letter', 'gave', 'film', 'name', 'letter', 'written', 'blood-like', 'red', 'ink', 'was', 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'only', 'two', 'letters', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'sent', 'Ripper', 'rest', 'being', 'hoaxes.The', 'actresses', 'who', 'played', 'prostitutes', 'were', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'created', 'human', 'aspect', 'drama', 'was', 'essential', 'involving', 'viewer', 'What', 'happened', 'women', 'was', 'unforgivable', 'movie', 'making', 'point', 'were', 'innocent', 'victims', 'circumstance', 'who', 'only', 'followed', ""'profession"", 'poverty', 'desperation.The', 'psychic', 'element', 'whereby', 'Depp', 'Abberline', 'can', ""'see"", 'murder', 'details', 'very', 'interesting', 'feature', 'lifts', 'From', 'Hell', 'level.As', 'far', 'Catholic', 'prostitute', 'carrying', 'Royal', 'baby', 'theory', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'illegitimate', 'children', 'royalty', 'centuries', 'event', 'need', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'trigger', 'systematic', 'campaign', 'brutality', 'Even', 'given', 'Prince', 'allegedly', ""'married"", 'Catholic', 'prostitute', 'apparently', 'legal', 'ceremony', '5', 'witnesses', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'much', 'cause', 'concern.Remember', 'days', 'Government', 'was', 'all-powerful', 'official', 'denial', 'backed', 'mere', 'threat', 'extermination', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'take', 'care', 'attempt', 'exploit', 'situation', 'Press.Who', 'was', 'Ripper', 'totally', 'unknown', 'local', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'worked', 'porter', 'morgue', 'teaching', 'hospital', 'somebody', 'acting', 'part', 'Conspiracy', 'group', 'not', 'driven', 'something', 'so', 'mundane', 'royal', 'baby', 'perhaps', 'involving', 'bloodline', 'infinitely', 'more', 'precious', 'therefore', 'dangerous', 'sacred', 'bloodline', 'holy', 'bloodline', 'MARY', 'Kelly', 'did', 'get', 'away', 'Now', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'original', 'plot', 'twist.A', 'trifle', 'unimaginative', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'well', 'typically', 'excellent', 'Amazon.com', 'price']",From Hell

587645,A2CZR46KVZLWDT,B00005JKJM,Suzie,"[1, 1]","The infamous story of ""Jack the Ripper"" and his five known victims is one of the few true-life horror stories that is as equally disturbing as anything the sick and twisted mind that calls itself ""Hollywood"" has ever made up. After all, ""Jack"" and his crimes existed well over a century ago, and his name and story are still common knowledge.Shocking even by modern standards, in 1888 what ""Jack"" did to five city prostitutes was downright unheard of - I'll spare you the gruesome description and even recommend that you cover your eyes and ears for that part of the movie. It's a strange thing to call a serial killer ""great"", but if one ever was, ""Jack"" was the greatest, right down to the fact that he was never caught.One hundred years later, what no one wanted to face then, is now too obvious to ignore. ""Jack"" had to be someone with a top-of-the-line knowledge of human anatomy, something that only an educated man could have had. Not to mention, that being the most-wanted man in England and never getting caught, would require that you reside in the last place anybody would ever look, such as a comfy, upper-class seat on the social ladder.This scenario, that the murderer was actually one of the guys running the show, is what the Hughes' brothers' `From Hell' centers around.Johnny Depp stars as the sleepily dispassionate, middle-class detective, Fred Abberline, who is slightly psychic and unashamedly tired of life. Abberline is put in charge of the investigation when a middle-aged prostitute is murdered in an indescribably violent fashion. After another woman of the same social situation is killed the same way, Abberline seeks out their friends, to find out whether the fact that these two women knew each other is coincidence or not. The standout among these ladies of the night are Irish-born Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), an eye-catching, younger woman who resorted to working the streets when her mother died. Seeing as Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are both attractive and famous, a romance blossoms between their characters, which ultimately serves the purpose of giving Abberline a reason to care about who the next victim will be.In retrospect nothing worth going into detail about happens, as far as the plot is concerned, after Abberline and Kelly meet; but while viewing the movie there are few dull moments.Heather Graham, who annoys me mainly because I don't understand what's so special about her, gets a passing grade as a street-smart prostitute whose fate is one of the bigger flaws in the accuracy of the story. Johnny Depp, whose acting talents are seemingly limitless, saves a role that could have easily seemed bland or nondescript if played by another actor.Although not without flaw, for the most part `From Hell' is not a horrible movie. Its diversion from the truth is a tad annoying, and its sloppy attempt at an explanation as to why things actually happened the way the movie suggests, yet history tells us the identity of ""Jack the Ripper"" was never discovered, is a little too confusing.The movies best points are style and scenery. Having never lived in London in the late nineteenth century, I do not actually know what it would be like; however, it certainly feels like the Hughes' brothers have successfully captured that feeling.I give it three stars, because although the plot was inconsistent and the characters were under-developed, the acting was good and method superb.",3,"Scary, but not perfect",1059523200,"07 30, 2003",2003,3429,"['infamous', 'story', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'five', 'known', 'victims', 'one', 'few', 'true-life', 'horror', 'stories', 'equally', 'disturbing', 'anything', 'sick', 'twisted', 'mind', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'made', 'up', 'Jack', 'crimes', 'existed', 'well', 'century', 'ago', 'name', 'story', 'are', 'still', 'common', 'knowledge.Shocking', 'even', 'modern', 'standards', '1888', 'what', 'Jack', 'did', 'five', 'city', 'prostitutes', 'was', 'downright', 'unheard', ""'ll"", 'spare', 'gruesome', 'description', 'even', 'recommend', 'cover', 'eyes', 'ears', 'part', 'movie', 'strange', 'thing', 'call', 'serial', 'killer', 'great', 'one', 'ever', 'was', 'Jack', 'was', 'greatest', 'right', 'down', 'fact', 'was', 'never', 'caught.One', 'hundred', 'years', 'later', 'what', 'one', 'wanted', 'face', 'then', 'now', 'too', 'obvious', 'ignore', 'Jack', 'had', 'be', 'someone', 'top-of-the-line', 'knowledge', 'human', 'anatomy', 'something', 'only', 'educated', 'man', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'Not', 'mention', 'being', 'most-wanted', 'man', 'England', 'never', 'getting', 'caught', 'would', 'require', 'reside', 'last', 'place', 'anybody', 'would', 'ever', 'look', 'such', 'comfy', 'upper-class', 'seat', 'social', 'ladder.This', 'scenario', 'murderer', 'was', 'actually', 'one', 'guys', 'running', 'show', 'what', 'Hughes', 'brothers', 'Hell', 'centers', 'around.Johnny', 'Depp', 'stars', 'sleepily', 'dispassionate', 'middle-class', 'detective', 'Fred', 'Abberline', 'who', 'slightly', 'psychic', 'unashamedly', 'tired', 'life', 'Abberline', 'put', 'charge', 'investigation', 'when', 'middle-aged', 'prostitute', 'murdered', 'indescribably', 'violent', 'fashion', 'woman', 'same', 'social', 'situation', 'killed', 'same', 'way', 'Abberline', 'out', 'friends', 'find', 'out', 'fact', 'two', 'women', 'knew', 'other', 'coincidence', 'not', 'standout', 'ladies', 'night', 'are', 'Irish-born', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'eye-catching', 'younger', 'woman', 'who', 'resorted', 'working', 'streets', 'when', 'mother', 'died', 'Seeing', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'are', 'attractive', 'famous', 'romance', 'blossoms', 'characters', 'ultimately', 'purpose', 'giving', 'Abberline', 'reason', 'care', 'who', 'next', 'victim', 'will', 'be.In', 'retrospect', 'nothing', 'worth', 'going', 'detail', 'happens', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'concerned', 'Abberline', 'Kelly', 'meet', 'viewing', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'dull', 'moments.Heather', 'Graham', 'who', 'mainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'so', 'special', 'passing', 'grade', 'street-smart', 'prostitute', 'fate', 'one', 'bigger', 'flaws', 'accuracy', 'story', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'acting', 'talents', 'are', 'seemingly', 'limitless', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'seemed', 'bland', 'nondescript', 'played', 'actor.Although', 'not', 'flaw', 'most', 'part', 'Hell', 'not', 'horrible', 'movie', 'diversion', 'truth', 'tad', 'annoying', 'sloppy', 'attempt', 'explanation', 'why', 'things', 'actually', 'happened', 'way', 'movie', 'yet', 'history', 'tells', 'identity', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'was', 'never', 'discovered', 'little', 'too', 'confusing.The', 'movies', 'best', 'points', 'are', 'style', 'scenery', 'Having', 'never', 'lived', 'London', 'late', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'do', 'not', 'actually', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'however', 'certainly', 'Hughes', 'brothers', 'have', 'successfully', 'captured', 'feeling.I', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'plot', 'was', 'inconsistent', 'characters', 'were', 'under-developed', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'method', 'superb']",From Hell

One of them, Ann Crook, a very beautiful and very nice girl, was secretely married to Prince Edward Albert Victor, duke of Clarence, and five of her prostitute friends attended the ceremony. One night, policemen from the Special Branch, Metropolitan Police, take Ann and her baby girl away. Ann is sent to a hospital; she is said to be crazy and dangerous, so the doctors decide that she needs very crude brain surgery (she receives three taps on the skull and into the brain). She becomes just the shadow of her previous self, and is imprisoned in a work house. Then four of her prostitute friends are savagely murdered, and each time some organs are removed from their bodies (the uterus, the liver, the heart etc.). The killer is dubbed Jack The Ripper, uses grape to attract his preys (that was a rare and sophisticated fruit in London at that time), and gives them wine laced with laudanum to make them weaker. Inspector Abberline is in charge of the case; he falls in love with Mary Kelly, the fifth friend of Ann. He is addicted to drugs. He manages to find the killer: it is Sir William Gull, physician of the Queen and a freemason fulfilling a duty (silence witnesses of the secret wedding). Unfortunately, Gull kills Mary and rips her body apart before Abberline can stop it. When the Queen learns what really happened, she is angry about the methods used. Gull is accused and tried by the freemasons for ""mayhems that jeopardized his brotherhood"". He suffers the same treatment as Ann... Finally, Abberline is so sad and depressed by the death of Mary that he commits suicide through  drugs overdose.So much for the sad, sad story.For the rest, the movie is also generally sad, with ugly images of disgruntled bodies, plenty of flies around, a very somber atmosphere, and a scenario which at times is a bit difficult to follow.",3,A sad story with a sad end and not an exceptional movie,1043884800,"01 30, 2003",2003,2038,"['whole', 'movie', 'sad', 'story', 'beginning', 'life', 'East', 'End', 'prostitutes', 'bangtails', 'are', 'craving', 'money', 'are', 'harassed', 'Nichols', 'gang', 'who', 'are', 'exploiting', 'One', 'Ann', 'Crook', 'very', 'beautiful', 'very', 'nice', 'girl', 'was', 'secretely', 'married', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Albert', 'Victor', 'duke', 'Clarence', 'five', 'prostitute', 'friends', 'attended', 'ceremony', 'One', 'night', 'policemen', 'Special', 'Branch', 'Metropolitan', 'Police', 'take', 'Ann', 'baby', 'girl', 'away', 'Ann', 'sent', 'hospital', 'said', 'be', 'crazy', 'dangerous', 'doctors', 'decide', 'very', 'crude', 'brain', 'surgery', 'three', 'taps', 'skull', 'brain', 'just', 'shadow', 'previous', 'self', 'imprisoned', 'work', 'house', 'Then', 'four', 'prostitute', 'friends', 'are', 'savagely', 'murdered', 'time', 'organs', 'are', 'removed', 'bodies', 'uterus', 'liver', 'heart', 'etc.', 'killer', 'dubbed', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'grape', 'attract', 'preys', 'was', 'rare', 'sophisticated', 'fruit', 'London', 'time', 'wine', 'laced', 'laudanum', 'make', 'weaker', 'Inspector', 'Abberline', 'charge', 'case', 'love', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'fifth', 'friend', 'Ann', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'find', 'killer', 'Sir', 'William', 'Gull', 'physician', 'Queen', 'freemason', 'fulfilling', 'duty', 'silence', 'witnesses', 'secret', 'wedding', 'Unfortunately', 'Gull', 'Mary', 'body', 'apart', 'Abberline', 'can', 'stop', 'When', 'Queen', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'angry', 'methods', 'used', 'Gull', 'accused', 'tried', 'freemasons', 'mayhems', 'jeopardized', 'brotherhood', 'same', 'treatment', 'Ann', 'Finally', 'Abberline', 'so', 'sad', 'depressed', 'death', 'Mary', 'suicide', 'drugs', 'overdose.So', 'much', 'sad', 'sad', 'story.For', 'rest', 'movie', 'also', 'generally', 'sad', 'ugly', 'images', 'disgruntled', 'bodies', 'plenty', 'flies', 'very', 'somber', 'atmosphere', 'scenario', 'times', 'bit', 'difficult', 'follow']",From Hell

The men that have been made legends, the women that have been crafted into nightmares, they are all out there and all stunning in their prowess. Here, we are talking about more than the ghastly, more than deeds that were haunting, because they have done more than dwindle and drift away in their own centuries. Here, we have monsters that survived the test of time.Amongst those, there are some that people know better than others, and some that still leave their mark on us when we close our eyes to dream. Many have had their lives transmodified until they became more than mortal, more than a part of the human sects they fed from, while others became specters that killed and walked away into the night. In From hell, we address one such figure that walked away going by the name of Jack the Ripper.While the subject has been covered many times over, it is still one that fascinates the darker side of our curiosity and makes us want to probe deeper into understanding. Thus, the Hughes Brothers, known for making quality films but not for showcasing pieces like this, looked through the Allan Moore looking glass and created.And what they created was a stunning piece of work, but that lands just a little too flat for me to give it a whole five stars because of the very end and because of a little too much love.Here, we follow the exploits of a detective rumored to be more than a detective as he searches for a man that is obviously skilled at what he does. We see murders that are sometimes harrowing in their graphic depicts but that are more often left to grizzly description, and we see a small trial of crumbs that the killer leaves behind that point to who he is.And that is the point to the chase, finding out who exactly he is.Judging the product as a whole, I would have to say that the Hughes Brothers did an excellent job when they converted From Hell from the graphic novel into a movie. This isn't to say that it was perfectly smithed, but the directions they decided to take, forging what they wanted to on their own, worked out well. Through an expert use of shadows that made the night seem even deeper, sound that made the moments of stark terror seem even graver, and the use of props as signatures, the feeling of the time and its terror was set. Here, the period was recreated, the clothing fitting the people that were chosen for their roles well, and the Ripper's antics were captures as they should have been captured. Motivated, perhaps, but nonetheless horrifying.For anyone that enjoys movements in horror that are about atmosphere and subjects that have been approached before but from a different angle, then this might be something that interests you. It is dark, to be sure, filled with concepts that are interesting and that lead the viewer down some odd corridors, and it has the ability to keep one's interest. It does, however, contain some graphic moments, so be warned of those little lovelies ahead of time.",4,Dissecting the Remnants of a Gruesome Past,1058659200,"07 20, 2003",2003,3038,"['Walking', 'dark', 'entries', 'time', 'sometimes', 'frightening', 'thing', 'behold', 'men', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'legends', 'women', 'have', 'been', 'crafted', 'nightmares', 'are', 'there', 'stunning', 'prowess', 'Here', 'are', 'talking', 'more', 'ghastly', 'more', 'deeds', 'were', 'haunting', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'dwindle', 'drift', 'away', 'own', 'centuries', 'Here', 'have', 'monsters', 'survived', 'test', 'time.Amongst', 'are', 'people', 'know', 'better', 'others', 'still', 'leave', 'mark', 'when', 'close', 'eyes', 'dream', 'Many', 'have', 'had', 'lives', 'transmodified', 'became', 'more', 'mortal', 'more', 'part', 'human', 'fed', 'others', 'became', 'specters', 'killed', 'walked', 'away', 'night', 'From', 'hell', 'address', 'one', 'such', 'figure', 'walked', 'away', 'going', 'name', 'Jack', 'Ripper.While', 'subject', 'been', 'covered', 'many', 'times', 'still', 'one', 'darker', 'side', 'curiosity', 'want', 'probe', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'Thus', 'Hughes', 'Brothers', 'known', 'making', 'quality', 'films', 'not', 'showcasing', 'pieces', 'looked', 'Allan', 'Moore', 'looking', 'glass', 'created.And', 'what', 'created', 'was', 'stunning', 'piece', 'work', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'flat', 'give', 'whole', 'five', 'stars', 'very', 'end', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'love.Here', 'follow', 'exploits', 'detective', 'rumored', 'be', 'more', 'detective', 'man', 'obviously', 'skilled', 'what', 'see', 'murders', 'are', 'sometimes', 'harrowing', 'graphic', 'depicts', 'are', 'more', 'often', 'left', 'grizzly', 'description', 'see', 'small', 'trial', 'crumbs', 'killer', 'point', 'who', 'point', 'chase', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'exactly', 'is.Judging', 'product', 'whole', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'Hughes', 'Brothers', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'when', 'converted', 'From', 'Hell', 'graphic', 'novel', 'movie', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'perfectly', 'smithed', 'directions', 'decided', 'take', 'forging', 'what', 'wanted', 'own', 'worked', 'out', 'well', 'expert', 'use', 'shadows', 'made', 'night', 'seem', 'even', 'deeper', 'sound', 'made', 'moments', 'stark', 'terror', 'seem', 'even', 'graver', 'use', 'props', 'signatures', 'feeling', 'time', 'terror', 'was', 'set', 'Here', 'period', 'was', 'recreated', 'clothing', 'fitting', 'people', 'were', 'chosen', 'roles', 'well', 'Ripper', 'antics', 'were', 'captures', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'captured', 'Motivated', 'perhaps', 'nonetheless', 'horrifying.For', 'anyone', 'movements', 'horror', 'are', 'atmosphere', 'subjects', 'have', 'been', 'approached', 'different', 'angle', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'interests', 'dark', 'be', 'sure', 'filled', 'concepts', 'are', 'interesting', 'lead', 'viewer', 'down', 'odd', 'corridors', 'ability', 'keep', 'one', 'interest', 'however', 'contain', 'graphic', 'moments', 'so', 'be', 'warned', 'little', 'lovelies', 'ahead', 'time']",From Hell

Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) is a beautiful and buxom lass who's life in London didn't turn out anything like she planned, struggling just to survive working in the world's oldest profession.  Mary and her friends live a harsh existence. Their only comforts are their own companionship and the belief that their lives cannot possibly get any worse than it already is. But they do. Their friend (and former prostitute) Ann, is kidnapped from her home and disappears.  Days later a member of their fellowship is brutally murdered. The women realize that they have unknowingly become a part of a conspiracy in which they have no control and are being eliminated one by one.  Meanwhile, the gruesome murder of the Whitechapel girl has gained the attention of a brilliant police officer, Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp). Abberline claims he had visions about the murder. The dreams continue, more prostitutes are brutally murdered by an anonymous killer who is dubbed Jack the Ripper and claims that he has been sent from Hell, and Abberline becomes increasingly entangled in the wicked web as he falls in love with Mary Kelly and races to solve the case before she meets Jack.The Hughes brothers pulled off an impressive horror/suspense film with FROM HELL. At it's most basic level, the movie is a slasher movie. But FROM HELL is a slasher flick done with taste. The film is rather gruesome in certain sections and is fairly historically accurate. However, the brothers feared the possibility of a NC-17 rating if too much was revealed and used a great deal of restraint in re-creating the famous murders. It is a testament to their skills that they were able to re-produce the real-life terror felt at the time, but without displaying all the grizzly details.  Not only that but the historical re-creation of 1888 Whitechapel is amazing. Almost every minute detail is reconstructed to perfection.Johnny Depp captures the essence of the real-life Abberline despite the fact that the real Abberline was short, balding, paunchy, and lived to a fairly ripe-old age.  Heather Graham does a decent job of portraying Mary Kelly, though it would have been nice to see a more real-looking actress in the role--Graham is just too Glamour Girlish.There have been many Jack the Ripper movies made over the years, but FROM HELL is one of the better ones (despite the inprobable conclusion). The movie is based upon the graphic novel by Alan Moore and though their are several changes, the movie stays true to the spirit of the original text.

Everything that I have heard good about this movie is totally and completely wrong.First off, I do not know the background on the Jack the Ripper story, so I can't comment on the factual side of the movie.  But everything else I can.First, the acting.  Johnny Depp lately seems to be playing the same roles over and over again.  He looks, acts, and talks exactly the same in every movie, such as Sleepy Hollow, The Ninth Gate, and finally this one.  He really isn't that great of an actor, and I don't think he can really carry a movie by himself.  Dating back to the train wreck The Astronauts Wife, he hasn't been in a good movie.  Heather Graham I am no fan.  She may look good, but I don't really care for her.I might have likened the characters more if the directing was done well enough.  But, it wasn't.  There were times when the film jumped around so much that I had no idea what was going on.  Maybe I'm just that dumb, but I needed some explanations.

The costumes and atmosphere were done really well. It really made me feel that this is what this dark and dirty place was really like. The difference between the haves and the have nots was very interesting. Of course the end leaves much speculation since Saucey Jack was never caught. But Depp was great.

From research on drug addiction/abuse, prostitution, medical science, 19th-Century London and Free Masonry, the script could not have been more carefully constructed, thoroughly entertaining and equally horrific.

However, I decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  The cinematography is excellent, the cast and acting is superb.  The criticism that the directors did not put enough emphasis on the horror of the situation I differ with.  The idea of telling a story over, and in the case of the story of Jack the Ripper, over many times is to tell it hopefully in a fresh way.  The perspective of this story is that of the detective played by Johnny Depp.  This is a fresh and entertaining telling of an old story.

587659,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B00005JKJM,Wheelchair Assassin,"[4, 5]","The Hughes brothers' From Hell is a movie about Jack The Ripper. And it isn't.  The movie's plot centers around the exploits and potential identity of Victorian England's mysterious knife-wielding prostitute killer, but its makers also try to shine a light on the darker aspects of that time and place, on the inevitable abuse of power, and on urban decay in general.  With a vicious murderer prowling the streets and leaving victims in pieces in his wake, there's a palpable sense of dread hanging over the proceedings, but even if Jack didn't make an appearance, there'd still be plenty to fear.  The 19th-century London of From Hell is a decidedly inhospitable place, racked by vice and crime, with plenty of unprincipled people willing to exploit the downtrodden for a buck (or, in this case, a pound).  In other words, it's sort of like any of dozens of urban ghettoes in 21-century America, except the appearances of those involved and the weapons of choice are different.I haven't read the Alan Moore graphic novel on which this movie was based, but the film version at least bears some pretty strong thematic parallels with Moore's V for Vendetta.  While that comic classic examined the dark underbelly of a fictional post-Cold War fascist England, From Hell attempts to strip away Victorian England's veneer of respectability to reveal a society awash in decadence, corruption, and prejudice, where power is lodged in decidedly undemocratic institutions and super-secret plots abound.  Some have written at some length about the movie's historical accuracy (or lack thereof), but it's really beside the point.  From Hell is, simply put, a movie, not a documentary, and it entertains more than well enough with what it has.  Plausibility issues aside, it looks great, with plenty of atmosphere and high style, some way cool visuals, truly painful death scenes, and liberal sprinklings of gore, which is just enough to get you to forgive the movie's haphazard pacing and occasional lapses into slasher-movie formula (even I could see some of the deaths coming a mile away).  It's also got Johhny Depp sporting a nifty British accent as Fred Abberline, the tortured detective trying to fight through the corridors of power to collar the slasher while he also fights his own addictions and the visions of death and mutilation that come to torment him in his sleep; and a bug-eyed Ian Holm hamming it up as a royal doctor with some murky motivations and an obvious God complex.So, in conclusion, you've got intrigue, nasty violence, some nice twists and turns in the plot as revelations start flying about halfway through, and another in a long line of excellent performances from Depp, not to mention a blindingly redheaded Heather Graham as perhaps the best-looking prostitute in all of London.  Sure, it's a bit shallow, and the plot doesn't always hum along as briskly as it should, but nothing's perfect, right?

Based on this background, From Hell posits the theory that the Ripper was actually a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Victor Albert who married & sired a child with a commoner, worse still a prostitute, and the movie revolves around the cover-up by members of the British upper class. Johnny Depp plays the role of the investigating officer who falls for a prostitute, Mary Kelly, played by the beautiful Heather Graham. There is more to the story than just that of course, and the plot is well driven, there is never a dull moment.
