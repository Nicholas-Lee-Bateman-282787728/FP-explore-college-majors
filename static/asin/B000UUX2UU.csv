1096409,A3LKP6WPMP9UKX,B000UUX2UU,Anna V. Carroll,"[8, 8]","I just viewed this film on-line and am still in shock. One of the Ritchie Boys is a former employer whom I was Personal Assistant to in the late 80s in NYC! If only he had shared this part of his life with me! Fred Howard in the film is the same flamboyant, over-the-top, brash man he was in the office. Tall, very handsome, with a distinct German accent, he returned after WWII to make a name for himself in business. The word 'genius' is not sufficient to describe his mind. When you walk into a Duane-Reade, Walgreens, or supermarket, you will see his designs. He invented the ""Leggs Egg"" among other items we take for granted. All the shelving that holds the merchandise. I knew he was brilliant but had no idea of his involvement in the war.If only Fred Howard had told me of this background he would have learned something about me he never knew--my uncle was shot down over Germany, was captured and imprisoned in a Stalag until the end of the war.  A tall, football player in high school, he returned to the US at the end of the war weighing barely 120 pounds. Mr. Howard and I could have talked for hours about the war because I became obsessed with the subject of Germany during WWII and to this day continue to study it. Amazon.com can certainly verify this with the films and books I have purchased over the years on Hitler, Count Von Stauffenberg, Heydrich, Albert Speer, Ernst Hanfstaengl and numerous other famous figures from that era.I remember attending Mr. Howard's 60th birthday party at Le Cirque in 1987. He is now 84 and I am almost 70. This film was made in 2004 so I don't know if Fred Howard is still alive. I would love to have the opportunity to visit with him and his wife and have a long talk about what I saw in this remarkable film. He did mention working for intelligence during the war but, to be honest, I didn't believe him! Blame it on my youth!I happened upon this film by accident. This film should be shown in every high school and university in America. Young German men (all Jewish) who left Germany in the 30s and arrived in the US only to be trained as interrogators and dropped over Germany at the end of the war! Why hasn't someone in Hollywood made a film of this story? Amazing! Simply amazing!The Ritchie Boys spotlights certain members who tell the story of their involvement in the group along with family photos and personal gems that are both tearful and enlightening. Fred Howard's story about Marlene Dietrich is wonderful! So Fred!This is a story you have never heard before. It opens up new vistas to those of us who study the second world war and Germany, in particular.  Of course it was not by accident that I found this film today. Divine intervention for sure! Now, after all these years, I understand why Fred Howard was the character he was. If only I had known back in the 80s when I was his Personal Assistant! It would have made the experience so much richer! What a man! What an incredible story! I loved this film.NOTE* Since writing this review I have learned that both Fred and his lovely wife have died. He died in his sleep the same day the Bernie Madoff scandal hit the papers. Ever the stock investor, I hope and pray this was not the reason for his death.  If so, add another victim to Madoff's list.",5,What Lies Beneath!,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,3276,"['just', 'viewed', 'film', 'on-line', 'am', 'still', 'shock', 'One', 'Ritchie', 'Boys', 'former', 'employer', 'whom', 'was', 'Personal', 'Assistant', 'late', '80s', 'NYC', 'only', 'had', 'shared', 'part', 'life', 'Fred', 'Howard', 'film', 'same', 'flamboyant', 'over-the-top', 'brash', 'man', 'was', 'office', 'Tall', 'very', 'handsome', 'distinct', 'German', 'accent', 'returned', 'WWII', 'make', 'name', 'business', 'word', ""'genius"", 'not', 'sufficient', 'describe', 'mind', 'When', 'walk', 'Duane-Reade', 'Walgreens', 'supermarket', 'will', 'see', 'designs', 'invented', 'Leggs', 'Egg', 'other', 'items', 'take', 'granted', 'shelving', 'merchandise', 'knew', 'was', 'brilliant', 'had', 'idea', 'involvement', 'war.If', 'only', 'Fred', 'Howard', 'had', 'told', 'background', 'would', 'have', 'learned', 'something', 'never', 'knew', 'uncle', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'Germany', 'was', 'captured', 'imprisoned', 'Stalag', 'end', 'war', 'tall', 'football', 'player', 'high', 'school', 'returned', 'US', 'end', 'war', 'weighing', 'barely', '120', 'pounds', 'Mr.', 'Howard', 'could', 'have', 'talked', 'hours', 'war', 'became', 'obsessed', 'subject', 'Germany', 'WWII', 'day', 'continue', 'study', 'Amazon.com', 'can', 'certainly', 'verify', 'films', 'books', 'have', 'purchased', 'years', 'Hitler', 'Count', 'Von', 'Stauffenberg', 'Heydrich', 'Albert', 'Speer', 'Ernst', 'Hanfstaengl', 'numerous', 'other', 'famous', 'figures', 'era.I', 'remember', 'attending', 'Mr.', 'Howard', '60th', 'birthday', 'party', 'Le', 'Cirque', '1987', 'now', '84', 'am', 'almost', '70', 'film', 'was', 'made', '2004', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Fred', 'Howard', 'still', 'alive', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'opportunity', 'visit', 'wife', 'have', 'long', 'talk', 'what', 'saw', 'remarkable', 'film', 'did', 'mention', 'working', 'intelligence', 'war', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Blame', 'youth', 'happened', 'film', 'accident', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'high', 'school', 'university', 'America', 'Young', 'German', 'men', 'Jewish', 'who', 'left', 'Germany', '30s', 'arrived', 'US', 'only', 'be', 'trained', 'interrogators', 'dropped', 'Germany', 'end', 'war', 'Why', ""n't"", 'someone', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'film', 'story', 'Amazing', 'Simply', 'amazing', 'Ritchie', 'Boys', 'spotlights', 'certain', 'members', 'who', 'tell', 'story', 'involvement', 'group', 'family', 'photos', 'personal', 'gems', 'are', 'tearful', 'enlightening', 'Fred', 'Howard', 'story', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'wonderful', 'So', 'Fred', 'story', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'up', 'new', 'vistas', 'who', 'study', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'Germany', 'particular', 'course', 'was', 'not', 'accident', 'found', 'film', 'today', 'Divine', 'intervention', 'sure', 'Now', 'years', 'understand', 'why', 'Fred', 'Howard', 'was', 'character', 'was', 'only', 'had', 'known', 'back', '80s', 'when', 'was', 'Personal', 'Assistant', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'experience', 'so', 'much', 'richer', 'What', 'man', 'What', 'incredible', 'story', 'loved', 'film.NOTE*', 'writing', 'review', 'have', 'learned', 'Fred', 'lovely', 'wife', 'have', 'died', 'died', 'sleep', 'same', 'day', 'Bernie', 'Madoff', 'scandal', 'hit', 'papers', 'Ever', 'stock', 'investor', 'hope', 'pray', 'was', 'not', 'reason', 'death', 'so', 'add', 'victim', 'Madoff', 'list']",The Ritchie Boys

In fact, as you would imagine, anywhere that knowledge of the local language and of German was essential.There are some very interesting stories here, but there are also a lot of slow spots.

These new recruits, alien refugees--some fresh off the boat from Europe--were shipped off to Camp Ritchie to learn how the German military did its thing so they could interrogate prisoners in warzones. It's a World War II story that hadn't been told yet, and the Ritchie Boys themselves make for engaging watching and a wonderful story. These are soldiers most of us can relate to, people who weren't so good at handling firearms but became single-minded in their work to charm, confuse, and terrify POWs who showed up and had information they wanted.This is an excellent addition to the growing sub-genres of Jewish and World War II documentaries, and sports skillful use of talking-head inteviews, music, and archival footage.DVD Extras: A full 43 minutes of deleted scenes and personal accounts fill out the disc.",5,Funny interrogators of World War II,1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,941,"['Put', 'use', 'what', 'so-called', 'Ritchie', 'Boys', 'asked', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'got', 'what', 'wanted', 'new', 'recruits', 'alien', 'refugees', 'fresh', 'boat', 'Europe', 'were', 'shipped', 'off', 'Camp', 'Ritchie', 'learn', 'how', 'German', 'military', 'did', 'thing', 'could', 'interrogate', 'prisoners', 'warzones', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'story', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'told', 'yet', 'Ritchie', 'Boys', 'make', 'engaging', 'watching', 'wonderful', 'story', 'are', 'soldiers', 'most', 'can', 'relate', 'people', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'good', 'handling', 'firearms', 'became', 'single-minded', 'work', 'charm', 'confuse', 'terrify', 'POWs', 'who', 'showed', 'up', 'had', 'information', 'wanted.This', 'excellent', 'addition', 'growing', 'sub-genres', 'Jewish', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'documentaries', 'sports', 'skillful', 'use', 'talking-head', 'inteviews', 'music', 'archival', 'footage.DVD', 'Extras', 'full', '43', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'personal', 'accounts', 'fill', 'out', 'disc']",The Ritchie Boys

1096414,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000UUX2UU,Jason,"[11, 11]","Making their way to America with little to nothing, many Jewish immigrants escaped German persecution, and prepared for their own kind of war while living in the United States.  Each having their own reason to enlist, most did it for personal and/or ideological reasons, the immigrants soon became part of the Military Intelligence Training Center (MITC) at Camp Ritchie, Maryland.  Sometimes called the Military Institute of Total Confusion because of its revolutionary, unpredictable nature, these soldiers were to be used for the unique purpose of interrogating German prisoners of war.With intimate knowledge of the enemy, the Ritchie Boys used their ingenuity and imagination to not only display conspicuous gallantry, but also engage in psychological and intelligence endeavors beneficial to the Allied efforts.  A typical soldier can be trained for war in half a year.  Becoming a fluent interpreter, translator, and interrogator in any foreign language simply can't be accomplished in that amount of time; as such, the Ritchie Boys had an invaluable purpose.The majority of the documentary is about each soldier's role during the war, and the various interesting details each can remember.  Telling stories of their experiences during war with humility and comedy, recalling past events and how they're affected today, is hilarious at times and very inspiring at others.  Displaying other-worldly courage, one of the Ritchie Boys (Werner Angress) even jumped from a plane on D-Day, without having gone through Airborne training!  As someone who has been skydiving several times, this astonishes me.  Another soldier (Si Lewen) was part of a direct broadcast to German soldiers, an attempt to convince the enemy soldiers to surrender.  Since the broadcasts were initially from speakers adjacent to the microphone, high fatalities were guaranteed.  Countless other stories amaze throughout the documentary, and I'm quite sure I could listen to these guys for quite some time.Former soldiers, military history buffs, and proud Americans should know about the important contributions made by Jewish immigrants during one of our nation's most precipitous moments.  Since I fit all three of the above qualifications, it's obvious that I loved the Ritchie Boys.",5,"Part of a new country, protecting an old homeland",1218067200,"08 7, 2008",2008,2262,"['Making', 'way', 'America', 'little', 'nothing', 'many', 'Jewish', 'immigrants', 'escaped', 'German', 'persecution', 'prepared', 'own', 'kind', 'war', 'living', 'United', 'States', 'having', 'own', 'reason', 'enlist', 'most', 'did', 'personal', 'and/or', 'ideological', 'reasons', 'immigrants', 'soon', 'became', 'part', 'Military', 'Intelligence', 'Training', 'Center', 'MITC', 'Camp', 'Ritchie', 'Maryland', 'Sometimes', 'called', 'Military', 'Institute', 'Total', 'Confusion', 'revolutionary', 'unpredictable', 'nature', 'soldiers', 'were', 'be', 'used', 'unique', 'purpose', 'interrogating', 'German', 'prisoners', 'war.With', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'enemy', 'Ritchie', 'Boys', 'used', 'ingenuity', 'imagination', 'not', 'only', 'display', 'conspicuous', 'gallantry', 'also', 'engage', 'psychological', 'intelligence', 'endeavors', 'beneficial', 'Allied', 'efforts', 'typical', 'soldier', 'can', 'be', 'trained', 'war', 'year', 'Becoming', 'fluent', 'interpreter', 'translator', 'interrogator', 'foreign', 'language', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'accomplished', 'amount', 'time', 'such', 'Ritchie', 'Boys', 'had', 'invaluable', 'purpose.The', 'majority', 'documentary', 'soldier', 'role', 'war', 'various', 'interesting', 'details', 'can', 'remember', 'Telling', 'stories', 'experiences', 'war', 'humility', 'comedy', 'recalling', 'past', 'events', 'how', ""'re"", 'affected', 'today', 'hilarious', 'times', 'very', 'inspiring', 'others', 'Displaying', 'other-worldly', 'courage', 'one', 'Ritchie', 'Boys', 'Werner', 'Angress', 'even', 'jumped', 'plane', 'D-Day', 'having', 'gone', 'Airborne', 'training', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'skydiving', 'several', 'times', 'soldier', 'Si', 'Lewen', 'was', 'part', 'direct', 'broadcast', 'German', 'soldiers', 'attempt', 'convince', 'enemy', 'soldiers', 'surrender', 'broadcasts', 'were', 'initially', 'speakers', 'adjacent', 'microphone', 'high', 'fatalities', 'were', 'guaranteed', 'Countless', 'other', 'stories', 'amaze', 'documentary', ""'m"", 'quite', 'sure', 'could', 'listen', 'guys', 'quite', 'time.Former', 'soldiers', 'military', 'history', 'buffs', 'proud', 'Americans', 'should', 'know', 'important', 'contributions', 'made', 'Jewish', 'immigrants', 'one', 'nation', 'most', 'precipitous', 'moments', 'fit', 'three', 'above', 'qualifications', 'obvious', 'loved', 'Ritchie', 'Boys']",The Ritchie Boys
