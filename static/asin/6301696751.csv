Directed by Danny De Vito who also stars follows the courtship and then marriage of The Roses through the good times and the many bad times. The couple decide to divorce and the bitter twosome become so ruthless that they who do anything to get what they want from the divorce settlement.

But, slowly and surely, reality soon began to wear away their Happily-Ever-After, and before long divorce was in the offing. Will Oliver and Barbara Rose part amicably and reasonably? Hell, no! A War of the Roses is blossoming, and no one will be left standing!This is a very funny, and yet thought-provoking movie. Kathleen Turner does a great job of playing Barbara Rose, an Every-Woman who is sweet and sensual, but with an indomitable spirit. Michael Douglas makes an excellent Oliver Rose - a man who knows what he wants, but doesn't necessarily know how to get it.The story of the movie was quite entertaining - the first part being love story, the second part being tragedy as we watch good love go bad, and the final part being wonderful slap-stick as love turns into hate. This is a great movie, that I have watched many times, and never tire of.

I know that Siskel & Ebert gave it Two Thumbs Up, but to me this was simply a bland movie. Yes, the acting was good and yes, the movie was directed well by Danny DeVito. Unfortunately, like another reviewer said, the subject matter was nothing but unsettling. I felt like I was watching an old Tom & Jerry cartoon. Indeed, the cartoonish violence only made me think the film should have been animated. It was great seeing a young Sean Astin on screen before he became rich and famous as Rudy.When a woman bites a man's penis off that is not funny to me. It made me cringe! This was four years before what happened to poor John Wayne Bobbitt and when I saw that scene I had flashbacks to what happened to that poor guy. I plan to put my DVD up for sale on Amazon. It's not worth seeing again. I'll also add this: The movie was not even shot where it's purported to take place!

Also, The War of the Roses is surprisingly well-directed movie. Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner help to make this movie to work. The War of the Roses reminds me a lot of the 18th century novels where there would be bitter familial feuds over something simple, but the characters are too stubborn to walk away. There is a nice cinematography going on during the film. I love that sensational fall of the chandelier where the trapped Roses would meet their fate at the ending. Kudos once again for Danny DeVito for his visionary work.7/11: Of course, The War of the Roses is simply about Michael Douglas versus Kathleen Turner. While nobody wins, I feel that Danny DeVito won by doing nothing and still look good while doing it. Hey, he still has that NES system in his office. My favorite line of the film is: ""There is no winning in this. There's only degrees of losing."" Another is: ""My fee is $450 an hour.

I have a handful of these gems I enjoy, and it is with prurient glee I add WAR OF THE ROSES to the mix.  Back in the Eighties I was less than impressed with the 'Romancing the Stone' franchise with Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny DeVito, so I avoided this film when it made its theatrical run; but cable is wonderful--eventually you're exposed to every movie you never caught in the cinema.  So when I ran across this incredibly entertaining movie I pulled up a chair, and began laughing at the antics of Oliver and Barbara Rose as they systematically destroy one another.A seemingly perfect marriage (affluent husband and wife in magnificent house with two cookie cutter kids) is suddenly sent into dysfunctional acrobatics when Barbara asks for a divorce.  Oliver is caught completely off guard--but not enough off his canter not to give a good fight, which includes refusing to give Barbara the house.  So a battle of wits begins, with each round getting nastier and raunchier as Oliver and Barbara ratchet up the pain and suffering--culminating in a violent and tragic ending so deserving of both vainglorious, self-absorbed, and selfish people.  And furthermore, the entire story is told in flashback, by Oliver's divorce attorney (DeVito), who uses the experience as an anecdote to future clients contemplating slugging it out with their spouses via divorce.  And it's a fabulous device!Turner and Douglas and DeVito are fantastic; the chemistry among all of them is as spot on as it is believable.  A classic dark comedy grows darker by the minute, and WAR OF THE ROSES certainly does this.  One star off for a bit of meandering which unnecessarily lengthens the film, but if you like a tasty dark comedy WAR OF THE ROSES will hit that sweet tooth.--D.

262216,A6HD47UMW7F6Y,6301696751,James Schoonmaker,"[3, 3]","Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner light up this movie about a couple that falls out of love.  Danny DeVito narrates, but his role as the lawyer that represented Oliver Rose during the divorce mostly serves as a frame to  hold the main story, and that's for the best.The action begins with a  man going to DeVito to begin divorce proceedings.  The lawyer tries to  convince him that a divorce isn't worth it, and begins narrating the story  of the Roses.  That's when the fun begins.It's difficult to call this a  comedy, black or otherwise, despite the often-amusing scenes.  It quickly  becomes obvious that this is less a story about love or the lack of it and  more of a struggle for power.All is well for this yuppie couple at  first.  Oliver (Douglas) is an extremely successful, up-and-coming  businessman, and Barbara (Turner) lives the ultimate housewife's dream: she  has a huge house, and nothing to do all day but decorate it-- and money  isn't an object.  If this seems like a sterotyped sex role, that's because  it is.  Things go downhill fast when Barbara realizes that she's not happy  in the role that society, and her husband in particular, have forced her  into.  She searches for a way to make her life more fulfilling, much to her  husband's dismay.  Oliver quickly becomes a staunch defender of the status  quo.When the divorce proceedings get sticky over a property issue--  Oliver claims it's his because his money paid for it and all of the  furnishings inside, and Barbara points out that the decorations, furniture,  and everything else that makes it a home were chosen by her-- the real  fight ensues.It's telling that all of the blows struck by Barbara  involve the breaking of sexual stereotypes, though it isn't clear that  Barbara does this intentionally.  For instance, she begins her own  business, and runs over Oliver's sporty new car with her monstrous truck.  The assaults begin with trying to hurt the other person, but devolve into  attempts to get the other to capitulate-- right down to the final scene.  This is one of those movies that has something new in it every time you  watch it, and it always makes you think, but is still extremely enjoyable  to watch.

The Roses live an upper crust lifestyle in New England and have raised their kids in the house of their dreams.  After 17 years, Barbara realizes she isn't happy as a housewife, and regrets all she gave up to become Mrs. Rose.  She asks Oliver for a divorce.  He's still in love with his sweetheart (or with the status quo) but grudgingly moves forward with divorce proceedings.  Armageddon sets in over the house, which was paid for with his money, but decorated and made a home by her.  Neither is willing to budge an inch with regards to the house.  He'll ruin her dinner parties; she'll destroy his office and collections.King Solomon might do well to come in and settle this house dispute, as he did in the case of two women who both claimed a baby was theirs.  Solomon revealed the true mother by suggesting he cut the baby in half with a sword (the true mother gave the other woman her baby rather than have it cut in half).  If only someone had stepped in to slap some sense into The Roses.  Their war becomes all consuming, and in the end, they are both willing to destroy the house to prevent it from falling into the other's hands.This is classic dark comedy with an all-star cast featuring Douglas, Turner, and DeVito.

There are moments of lightness but they come all too seldom and the story of increasing bitterness and pettiness comes to the fore.The Roses fell in love in college, married and seemed to have the perfect life. He was an ivy league lawyer and she was the ""perfect housewife"". They both have their problems. He takes her too much for granted and she is a materialistic snob. Still, they seem to be so much in love that they can overcome their personal foibles. It doesn't work out that way.After he is rushed to the hospital with an apparent heart attack, she is too busy with her career to even pick him up when he is discharged. Later that night, she tells him that she wants a divorce. From there, the vindictiveness and sniping continue to escalate as both descend into an orgy of mutual contempt and hatred.There are times when it is possible to feel sorry for both of the characters. More often, both seem to be too contemptible to pity. Each is more concerned with the destruction of the other and ""winning"" than in any possible healing. There are some differences. He genuinely loves her and she genuinely hates him. This is carried right through to the bitter, and I do mean BITTER, end.It's hard to call this entertaining. It is frightening, though, to see how far hatred can take a person. Anyone contemplating a divorce should see this film.

Perez ""Jose""","[4, 5]","Before a communal pre-9/11 family-and-peace zeitgeist set in,  &quot;American Beauty&quot; shook audiences to the core with it's chillingly real look behind our friends-and-neighbors' outwardly tranquil existence.  Years before that Oscar-winning new classic, &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; dealt with many of the same themes in more satirical and explosive ways, with claws bared and punches traded between the couple in question.&quot;American Beauty&quot; hit close to home through its &quot;everyman&quot; Lester Burnham point of view, and its laughs were of the nervous, too-close-for-comfort variety.  But at the time of its release, the marriage depicted in &quot;The Roses&quot; was so prepousterously extreme and foreign to most audiences, the film was both hailed and reviled as a sort of anti-family anti-Christ.  &quot;The Left&quot; loved Kathleen Turner's empowerment wife and tit-for-tat vengeance against the equally malicious Michael Douglas, while the Religious Right pointed at the film's mean-spiritedness as a sad indictment on the state of &quot;Family Values.&quot;Today, after &quot;American Beauty&quot; lay bare the new realities of familial strife, and as Americans themselves confront issues like terrorism, hatred and discrimination in unprecedented ways, &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; seems almost tame.  Still, this movie packs more than a few punches (and not only between the dueling Roses.)  There are moments of sheer brilliance here that resonate and haunt, as well as inspired performances and frequent cliffhangers that will keep audiences both entertained and challenged.  Couples are forewarned to see it together at their own risk!  For sheer shock value, few celluloid moments compare to the Roses swinging (literally, and at one another) on their massive chandelier and Turner's take on the meaning of road rage.  Add Danny DeVito's wise turn as the narrator, and Douglas' supreme husband role - one of his best ever - and the film SOARS.Truth be told, audiences will flinch at some of the movie's still-shocking moments, and kids under 16 may be frightened to the point of having mom-and-pop-kill-each-other nightmares.

262223,A3VX58UK0J9NJJ,6301696751,J. S. Lang,"[1, 1]","One of the best films of the 1990s, but not for everyone's taste. Another reviewer pointed out that in the course of the movie we see the man and woman meet, feel an attraction, fall in love (well, LUST, actually), then living in a posh home where there is no romance, just sharing material possessions and feeling no emotional connection to each other or their two kids.  Well, I agree, and I think that's the whole point - once you get past the hot-sex period, and once you've bought everything you ever wanted, what is there?  Not a thing, and in the typical narrative, each spouse would find another hottie, start the process all over again, serial monogamy, etc, etc.  But here there is no hint that either the husband or wife has anyone on the side, or even wants anyone. They both want the house and its contents - wife doesn't want husband. So follow some of the nastiest marital stunts ever seen in film.  (As a follow-up, maybe watch one of the gentler divorce comedies of the 1930s, like Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in The Awful Truth.)  As dangerous as the game becomes, it always seems creepily true to life.  Will they reconcile (not likely, given the wife's unexplained contempt for the husband), or will they end up doing some seriously bodily harm in the quest to force the other to move out?  On the assumption that maybe you didn't read another review that gives away the ending, I'll refrain from doing that.Most of it is not, admittedly, knee-slapping funny, probably because it seems a little too true to life, or maybe because we've known of divorces that were almost this contentious (and dangerous).  Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner do well in their roles, spending most of the movie hating each other, which is a definite change from their Romancing the Stone gigs.  Danny DeVito plays it likable and lovable as a divorce lawyer trying to keep this powder keg from exploding. Things get VERY tense near the end, and it's a bumpy ride, but fun, if you're in the right mood.

Still, after a number of viewings, I'd label it a classic, possibly the best of its type at what it is dramatizing.  As such, it also dramatizes the moral to the story - always seek a win/win situation in all negotiations, especially relationships.

Swanson,"[1, 1]","4.4 starsWhile it does seem a bit dated by now, Roses does have many very funny scenes, and is one of the blackest comedies to come out of Hollywood since the 70s. Douglas and Turner are far better here than in their Romancing The Stone flicks, and DeVito's direction does credit to Leeson's excellent script.I can only imagine that anyone going through a divorce would love this one. Thankfully I can't comment on that aspect, knock on wood. There's no love lost between any of the central players here, not just the Roses, and the cynicism is hard-bitten, all the more so for the flashes of love on display. I've always sensed that both Turner and Douglas are at heart rather dark people...there's that edge of nastiness lurking beneath all their best roles that just feels a little too believable. DeVito tkaes those edges and polishes them to gleaming blackness here, and adds many fine camera shots to boot.I'm not nuts about his overly self-glorifying narrative role, though, and think it detracts a bit and adds too much length to a slightly overlong film. (DeVito says on the dvd extras that WOTR was 3 hours before editing, but even a little more could have been trimmed. The extras are well done, btw, and add to the package. DeVito is clearly proud of this film, and justifiably so.) Trivia note: the guy Danny talks to in his office is actually the voice of Homer Simpson. At least his marriage works!I loved the ending, so very atypical and so perfectly apt. All in all, this is an almost five star movie that goes on just a little too long, but is absolutely worth seeing if you're in the mood for a very black comedy, or are in the throes of a failing marriage.

The leads Kathleen Turner & Michael Douglas have terrific chemistry, but then again they starred in many films together including ""Romancing the Stone"".

It was certainly most interesting watching the leads share the main residence during their divorce because neither side was willing to give up the house. Talk about stubborn!

Interestingly enough, in one of the special features--a deleted scenes montage--DeVito introduces the montage (as the director) and comments on how most comedies are about an hour and a half and this one was special; it's almost two hours.Too long.  The acting is excellent, no question.  And there are some funny bits and some sarcasm that definitely works.  But watching the twosome constantly throw stuff at each other, insult each other, destroy everything in sight, and otherwise abuse one another--over and over again--eventually gets pretty tiring.DeVito's brief interludes, as he narrates the tale to an unsuspecting about-to-be-divorced silent guy, are welcome breathers from the endless barrage. The 80s materialism thing is done fairly well here--especially when Michael Douglas takes a leak on Kathleen Turner's gourmet fish recipe--but within a short time the point is made and there's nowhere to go but down.  Or just to keep going.And that's what happens.  It keeps going and going and then like the (in)famous bunny, except with severe arthritis, it finally, gratefully, stops.  You breathe a sigh of relief when it's over; then, possibly, you wish you hadn't started in the first place.One of the big problems here is a total lack of warmth--even at the beginning when things are supposedly lovey-dovey.  You don't feel that.  There's attraction and lust and then, poof, lawyerdom and marriage and kids.  That's it.  And then the fighting starts.For a smarter movie about 80s materialism and marital strife, see The New Age with Judy Davis and Peter Weller.

Then it showed the dog stick his head up when he was lying outside when he heard the comotion. I stopped watching after an hour, so i dont think she hurt the dog, because her character was not heartless.. just suffering. I laughed during the scene when douglas was sawing off her heels on her expensive shoes, that was on purpose for those who saw romancing the stone, remember when they were in the jungle and he sawed off the heels on her shoes, and she said is nothing i own sacred to you? But as previously stated this is a dark comedy with great acting, and turner was very sexy in this film. It also refreshed my memory when the cat was killed, not funny even though many sick demented people think it's hilarious when animals are slaughtered in movies and have serious mental problems, but the cat dying turned out to be an accident, in fact my grandpa killed his own beloved cat by accident.. the cat liked to sleep on the driveway behind the tire of his car, and he started to drive and the cat was killed. not funny, it was a tragedy and he cried because of the guilt and the love he had for the family cat...also my mom's favorite cat. But these things do happen.. i dont think it's fair at all though when couples are splitting up they use their animals against each other to hurt one another and even their own children. During this movie alot of things reminded me of famous tales of my grandparents who split up. at the same age as the roses. and they did alot of crazy things also, like my grandpa cut up my grandma's new blouses with scissors. and put something (i cant remember what) on her douche. sick i know. but when people are going through such stress. and when they are hurting. they do act crazy. like a breakdown.... so this movie was realistic in showing what people will actually do to fight over houses, belongings. or whatever. but it's actually their own self esteem and pain and suffering that's making them act that way.. not the materials.",5,classic comedy/drama,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,2448,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'years', 'decade', 'really', 'kid', 'going', 'memory', 'i', 'always', 'thought', 'mrs.', 'rose', 'turner', 'had', 'indeed', 'killed', 'benny', 'dog', 'not', 'ok', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'actually', 'bluffing..', 'just', 'upset', 'douglas', 'chased', 'woof', 'thing', 'realized', 'made', 'parfait', 'dog', 'food', 'not', 'actually', 'dog', 'said', 'benny', 'let', 'think', 'killed', 'dog', 'revenge', 'Then', 'showed', 'dog', 'stick', 'head', 'up', 'when', 'was', 'lying', 'outside', 'when', 'heard', 'comotion', 'stopped', 'watching', 'hour', 'i', 'dont', 'think', 'hurt', 'dog', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'heartless..', 'just', 'suffering', 'laughed', 'scene', 'when', 'douglas', 'was', 'sawing', 'off', 'heels', 'expensive', 'shoes', 'was', 'purpose', 'who', 'saw', 'romancing', 'stone', 'remember', 'when', 'were', 'jungle', 'sawed', 'off', 'heels', 'shoes', 'said', 'nothing', 'i', 'own', 'sacred', 'previously', 'stated', 'dark', 'comedy', 'great', 'acting', 'turner', 'was', 'very', 'sexy', 'film', 'also', 'refreshed', 'memory', 'when', 'cat', 'was', 'killed', 'not', 'funny', 'even', 'many', 'sick', 'demented', 'people', 'think', 'hilarious', 'when', 'animals', 'are', 'slaughtered', 'movies', 'have', 'serious', 'mental', 'problems', 'cat', 'dying', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'accident', 'fact', 'grandpa', 'killed', 'own', 'beloved', 'cat', 'accident..', 'cat', 'liked', 'sleep', 'driveway', 'tire', 'car', 'started', 'drive', 'cat', 'was', 'killed', 'not', 'funny', 'was', 'tragedy', 'cried', 'guilt', 'love', 'had', 'family', 'cat', 'also', 'mom', 'favorite', 'cat', 'things', 'do', 'happen..', 'i', 'dont', 'think', 'fair', 'when', 'couples', 'are', 'splitting', 'up', 'use', 'animals', 'other', 'hurt', 'one', 'even', 'own', 'children', 'movie', 'alot', 'things', 'reminded', 'famous', 'tales', 'grandparents', 'who', 'split', 'up', 'same', 'age', 'roses', 'did', 'alot', 'crazy', 'things', 'also', 'grandpa', 'cut', 'up', 'grandma', 'new', 'blouses', 'scissors', 'put', 'something', 'i', 'cant', 'remember', 'what', 'douche', 'sick', 'i', 'know', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'such', 'stress', 'when', 'are', 'hurting', 'do', 'act', 'crazy', 'breakdown', 'movie', 'was', 'realistic', 'showing', 'what', 'people', 'will', 'actually', 'do', 'fight', 'houses', 'belongings', 'actually', 'own', 'self', 'esteem', 'pain', 'suffering', 'making', 'act', 'way..', 'not', 'materials']",N/A

Like when your tech-ed teacher tells you why it's bad to get your hair or fingers too close to the sanding machines.The film is narrated by DeVito, a lawyer retelling a tale he lived through when dealing with a once happily married couple... an especially materialistic married couple!  So the entire movie switches from 'past' to 'present,' focusing mostly on the story of the soon to be unhappy lovers.  After their so-called civil divorce, they are both determined to keep the dream house they both contributed to, and Oliver, the once husband, is determined to keep his former wife, Barbara, who can't stand him to the point of making them both miserable!  From here, the story just gets crueler and more bizarre...So if you're the type of person who likes to listen to stories where terrible things happen to ordinary and fallible people, if you watch car races to see a crash, or you laugh during the news, chances are you'll enjoy this movie, and other black comedies for that matter.

Parker ""Raymond Parker 'Actor,Writ...","[0, 0]","This has got to be one of my all time favorite &#34;Black Comedies&#34;, as well as all time favorites period! Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner play the Roses, a wealthy married couple with a seemingly perfect life: Prestigious careers, kids in Ivy League schools, beautiful mansion, etc. Only problem is, they hate each other. The story is recounted by their divorce lawyer played to snarky perfection by the film's director, Danny DeVito. He tells how they first meet as struggling college students and fall passionately in love. We then pick them up several years later when they are married with two children and Oliver (Michael Douglas) is working hard to become a partner in his law firm-this is one of my favorite scenes. It shows the Roses at Christmas time in the living room of their extremely modest home. Oliver is at his paper covered desk trying to work while Barbara (Kathleen Turner) tries to make their pitiful Christmas tree look decent. Their overweight children are both screaming and playing, trying to get daddy's attention. At this point Oliver snaps and tells everyone to &#34;shut up&#34; so he can work. You know exactly what this poor man is going through, he wants so desperately to get his family to the next level that he almost ignores them. Barbara turns his work-obsessed attitude around by showing him his Christmas present from her: A Morgan Plus Four roadster that needs to be restored. We pick them up again a few years into the future where they now reside in an expensive apartment. Their circle of friends now include Danny DeVito at his unscrupulous best as a divorce lawyer, and several other well-to-do types who they invite to a dinner party. It is during this dinner that we see the first cracks in the marriage. Oliver constantly interrupts Barbara as she tries to retell a story of how they came upon a particular piece of artwork. After the guests have left, they have a blow-up, but as in most love stories, they make up-to fight another day. Flash forward once more into the future; they now reside in a huge mansion in a secluded community. Oliver is now a full-fledged partner and owner of a fully restored Morgan roadster, and the kids are in ivy league universities. This is where the story really picks up. Barbara is bored so she does what Hollywood apparently thinks that bored housewives do: she takes a cooking class. Turns out she's an exceptional cook! She soon starts a catering business which irks Oliver and the cracks in their marriage are now threatening to level the entire foundation. Barbara demands a divorce, so Oliver sees Gavin D'Amato (Danny D.) who finds an obscure law that sates as long as two people are gong through a divorce, both parties have the right to reside in the same household. Oliver and Barbara proceed to one-up each other progressively culminating with both of them dying in each other's arms. Even though billed as a black comedy, this movie is so much more. It's about marriage degenerating. It's about the pursuit of status and wealth. It's about raising a family. It's about the age old feud between Man and Woman. What really binds this movie together is Mr. Douglas's bravura performance (where was is Oscar nod at least?) His Oliver Rose is Everyman trying to provide for his family. Unfortunately the price for his success is the dissolution of his marriage. I know that Mr. Douglas is best known for is white-collar villains, but it's his portrayals of Men-In-Trouble that really stand out. He is at his best in these roles (Falling Down, Wonder Boys, Solitary Man and Traffic) where he plays a man whose world is falling down around him, usually by his own hand. Mr. DeVito's direction is near flawless as he takes us on a surreal romantic journey that devolves into a nightmare. As the Roses try to &#34;off&#34; each other, he stays away from the slapstick element that was prevalent in &#34;Throw Momma From The Train&#34; opting instead for ways in which the wealthy might do it: Destroying Pate, desecrating expensive art pieces, poisoning each other's pets. But what's really strong about this movie is that neither one of the Olivers is made out to be the Bad Guy. They are both at fault at various times throughout the movie.  This is one of the few movies that I can watch repeatedly.",5,Why You Should Think FIVE Times Before Getting Married,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,4299,"['got', 'be', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', '34', 'Black', 'Comedies', '34', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'period', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'play', 'Roses', 'wealthy', 'married', 'couple', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'life', 'Prestigious', 'careers', 'kids', 'Ivy', 'League', 'schools', 'beautiful', 'mansion', 'etc', 'Only', 'problem', 'hate', 'other', 'story', 'recounted', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'played', 'snarky', 'perfection', 'film', 'director', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'how', 'first', 'meet', 'struggling', 'college', 'students', 'fall', 'passionately', 'love', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'are', 'married', 'two', 'children', 'Oliver', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'working', 'hard', 'become', 'partner', 'law', 'firm-this', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'Roses', 'Christmas', 'time', 'living', 'room', 'extremely', 'modest', 'home', 'Oliver', 'paper', 'covered', 'desk', 'trying', 'work', 'Barbara', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'make', 'pitiful', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'look', 'decent', 'overweight', 'children', 'are', 'screaming', 'playing', 'trying', 'get', 'daddy', 'attention', 'point', 'Oliver', 'snaps', 'tells', 'everyone', '34', 'shut', 'up', '34', 'so', 'can', 'work', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'poor', 'man', 'going', 'so', 'desperately', 'get', 'family', 'next', 'level', 'almost', 'Barbara', 'work-obsessed', 'attitude', 'showing', 'Christmas', 'present', 'Morgan', 'Four', 'roadster', 'be', 'restored', 'pick', 'up', 'again', 'few', 'years', 'future', 'where', 'now', 'reside', 'expensive', 'apartment', 'circle', 'friends', 'now', 'include', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'unscrupulous', 'best', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'several', 'other', 'well-to-do', 'types', 'who', 'invite', 'dinner', 'party', 'dinner', 'see', 'first', 'cracks', 'marriage', 'Oliver', 'constantly', 'Barbara', 'retell', 'story', 'how', 'came', 'particular', 'piece', 'artwork', 'guests', 'have', 'left', 'have', 'blow-up', 'most', 'love', 'stories', 'make', 'up-to', 'fight', 'day', 'Flash', 'forward', 'once', 'more', 'future', 'now', 'reside', 'huge', 'mansion', 'secluded', 'community', 'now', 'full-fledged', 'partner', 'owner', 'fully', 'restored', 'Morgan', 'roadster', 'kids', 'are', 'ivy', 'league', 'universities', 'where', 'story', 'really', 'up', 'Barbara', 'bored', 'so', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'apparently', 'bored', 'housewives', 'do', 'cooking', 'class', 'out', 'exceptional', 'cook', 'soon', 'catering', 'business', 'Oliver', 'cracks', 'marriage', 'are', 'now', 'threatening', 'level', 'entire', 'foundation', 'Barbara', 'divorce', 'so', 'Oliver', 'Gavin', ""D'Amato"", 'Danny', 'D.', 'who', 'obscure', 'law', 'as', 'long', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'gong', 'divorce', 'parties', 'have', 'right', 'reside', 'same', 'household', 'Oliver', 'Barbara', 'proceed', 'one-up', 'other', 'progressively', 'culminating', 'dying', 'other', 'arms', 'Even', 'though', 'billed', 'black', 'comedy', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'marriage', 'degenerating', 'pursuit', 'status', 'wealth', 'raising', 'family', 'age', 'old', 'feud', 'Man', 'Woman', 'What', 'really', 'movie', 'together', 'Mr.', 'Douglas', 'bravura', 'performance', 'where', 'was', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'least', 'Oliver', 'Rose', 'Everyman', 'trying', 'provide', 'family', 'Unfortunately', 'price', 'success', 'dissolution', 'marriage', 'know', 'Mr.', 'Douglas', 'best', 'known', 'white-collar', 'villains', 'portrayals', 'Men-In-Trouble', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'best', 'roles', 'Falling', 'Down', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'Solitary', 'Man', 'Traffic', 'where', 'man', 'world', 'falling', 'down', 'around', 'usually', 'own', 'hand', 'Mr.', 'DeVito', 'direction', 'near', 'flawless', 'surreal', 'romantic', 'journey', 'nightmare', 'Roses', 'try', '34', '34', 'other', 'away', 'slapstick', 'element', 'was', 'prevalent', '34', 'Throw', 'Momma', 'Train', '34', 'opting', 'instead', 'ways', 'wealthy', 'might', 'do', 'Destroying', 'Pate', 'desecrating', 'expensive', 'art', 'pieces', 'poisoning', 'other', 'pets', 'what', 'really', 'strong', 'movie', 'one', 'Olivers', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'are', 'fault', 'various', 'times', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'repeatedly']",N/A

262247,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,6301696751,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","I won't rehash the plot. It's simply a wonderfully observed crumbling of a marriage probably never built on the healthiest of foundations in the first place.  One could say that the movie is perhaps an indictment of materialism, where we see Kathleen Turner's character finally turning bitter when she's done all the decorating she can, and Michael Douglas is too busy earning money to care that his wife is feeling empty now.  Whose fault is it that the marriage is a shambles?  Did Douglas continue to quest for more and more money to make himself feel good about himself and to keep his wife happy...and did she encourage it but continuing to spend, spend, spend?  And when the ruins are revealed, it isn't emotional territory, as such, that they fight over, but the material goods that have come to represent emotional attachment for them.All that may be, but what is so great about the movie is its unrelenting viciousness once the barbs start flying.  When Turner tells Douglas she had to pull off to the side of the road when she thought he might be dieing from a heart attack because &quot;she was happy&quot; he might pass away...wow, if that ain't a slap in the face??It's interesting that Turner is really the hard case in this.  Douglas keeps saying that he's still in love with her.  He keeps softening towards Turner, and she rebuffs him with her jaw set more and more firmly.  Yet, is he really in love with her, or just feels he can &quot;get her back&quot; to put back on his trophy case. He probably doesn't know either...combination of the two, I'd say.The movie is keenly observed, and the lead performances are flawless,really.  Our sympathies bounce back and forth, back and forth all the time.  And because we're watching a glossy Hollywood movie, in the back of our minds, we're expecting it all to turn out OKAY.  Sure, they say things and do things no human can be forgiven for, but what the heck...it's a movie.  I congratulate all involved for having the courage of their convictions.  This is a BLACK comedy in all the best ways.  The final action Turner takes with Douglas, as they lay side by side, is PERFECT!!  I hadn't seen the movie in years until the other day, but many of her comments and actions were burned in my memory.  These two actors had such great chemistry.  A reteaming, even after all these years, might be fun.Anyway, my one gripe about the movie is the role of &quot;narrator&quot; that DeVito plays.  He's an attorney (and partner of Douglas'), who, in his scenes WITH Douglas, is quite amusing.  But he also interjects little comments from time to time as he is retelling the story of the Roses to a prospective client.  The tone of these scenes is unconvincing, DeVito does a terrible job of smoking (don't ask), and they add nothing to our appreciation of the &quot;message.&quot;  Maybe the movie wasn't long enough without these scenes...but I could sure do without them.By the way,the DVD has a montage of deleted scenes, &quot;hosted&quot; by DeVito.  It's worth watching, right through to the end, because DeVito (and his wife, Rhea Pearlman) have a very brief but delightful &quot;scene&quot; at the conclusion.This is a great movie, and a lost treasure, in many ways, because so few people gave it a try when it came out.  It still holds quite true today, I think, and despite the slightly outdated fashions in the film, remains timeless.",4,"4.5 stars, really.

He directed the film and it stars Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas. Their relationship in the film is nothing like their earlier partnership in Romancing The Stone. Here, the Roses are at war, in a modern parody of the historic British War Of The Roses, Tudors and Stuarts whose emblems were white and red roses. They are fabulously rich, they met traveling foreign lands and buying antiques. She's an experienced gymnist and he's a wealthy executive. Eventually, their love life and marriage falls apart and a divorce, long-lived and bitter, ensues.The entire film is about that terrible divorce. It's a bit of a downer for happily married couples but it's still an enjoyable film as far as social satire and dark comedy. It's not really possible for any couple to conduct their divorce in the spiteful, nasty way these two go at it. Michael Douglas ruins his wife's dinner party, runs over her cat, and later Douglas eats his own dog which she had made into dinner. Their fighting becomes an all-out war, enacted inside their million dollar estate. At one point, they are hanging for dear life on a chandelier. Danny DeVito plays the lawyer and he is delivering absolute comedy. Remember, DaVito was a great choice for comic roles.

Thankfully, director Danny Devito's dark masterpiece THE WAR OF THE ROSES offerred no such assurance. As in the great black comedies of the past -- MONSIEUR VERDOUX, DR. STRANGELOVE, LOLITA, SUNSET BOULEVARD -- the characters must face retribution. The story of Barbara and Oliver Rose (Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas) starts out mimicking classic Hollywood screwball comedies like THE AWFUL TRUTH or HIS GIRL FRIDAY, in which estranged husbands and wives are eventually reunited through a series of amusing incidents. Then, slowly, the film turns and you find yourself gagging on your guffaws as these partners in a disintegrating marriage engage in mutual assured destruction.THE WAR OF THE ROSES is often hilarious, but this comedy is not pretty. Rather, it is a bracing splash of carbolic acid in the face of romance and is thus likely to make a lot of people very uncomfortable. Toying with the conventions of domestic comedy is inflammatory stuff, particularly at a time when we're used to drinking our genres straight up. After all, in 1986, when Jonathan Demme messed with our expectations in SOMETHING WILD, shifting to a menacing tone in the second half, the audience turned on him. (Perhaps the film was just a little ahead of its time.) Woody Allen's CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS (1989) also mixed comedy with darker material, and, this time, audiences responded to it. The War of the Roses is more subversive and corrosive than either of those films, however. And if the film is marred by a rather heavy-handed dose of misogyny (it's no coincidence that the movie was directed and written by men -- DeVito and Michael Leeson, respectively), you still have to give credit to any comedy that can make you feel this queasy. Like the Demme and Allen films, THE WAR OF THE ROSES wreaks havoc with our value systems and forces us to face up to the resulting mayhem. An alternative title for the film -- uttered by Turner at one point and originally credited to Dorothy Parker -- could be ""What fresh hell is this?""",5,Danny Devito's dark masterpiece marked a welcome return to true black comedy.,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,2557,"['1980s', 'were', 'marked', 'series', 'shameless', 'mean-spirited', 'comedies', 'celebrating', 'joys', 'middle', 'class', 'materialism', 'RISKY', 'BUSINESS', 'THE', 'SECRET', 'OF', 'MY', 'SUCCESS', 'film', 'starring', 'former', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'comics', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'etc', 'Extreme', 'amorality', 'pursuit', 'social', 'gain', 'was', 'vice', 'comedies', 'matter', 'how', 'nasty', 'characters', 'were', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'SCROOGED', 'GHOSTBUSTERS', 'example', 'never', 'had', 'account', 'actions', 'ends', 'always', 'justified', 'means', 'Thankfully', 'director', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'dark', 'THE', 'WAR', 'THE', 'ROSES', 'offerred', 'such', 'assurance', 'great', 'black', 'comedies', 'past', 'MONSIEUR', 'VERDOUX', 'DR.', 'STRANGELOVE', 'LOLITA', 'SUNSET', 'BOULEVARD', 'characters', 'must', 'face', 'retribution', 'story', 'Barbara', 'Oliver', 'Rose', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'out', 'mimicking', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'AWFUL', 'TRUTH', 'HIS', 'GIRL', 'FRIDAY', 'estranged', 'husbands', 'wives', 'are', 'eventually', 'reunited', 'series', 'amusing', 'incidents', 'Then', 'slowly', 'film', 'turns', 'find', 'gagging', 'guffaws', 'partners', 'disintegrating', 'marriage', 'engage', 'mutual', 'assured', 'destruction.THE', 'WAR', 'THE', 'ROSES', 'often', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'not', 'pretty', 'Rather', 'bracing', 'splash', 'carbolic', 'acid', 'face', 'romance', 'thus', 'likely', 'make', 'lot', 'people', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'Toying', 'conventions', 'domestic', 'comedy', 'inflammatory', 'stuff', 'particularly', 'time', 'when', ""'re"", 'used', 'drinking', 'genres', 'straight', 'up', '1986', 'when', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'messed', 'expectations', 'SOMETHING', 'WILD', 'shifting', 'menacing', 'tone', 'second', 'half', 'audience', 'turned', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'ahead', 'time', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'CRIMES', 'MISDEMEANORS', '1989', 'also', 'mixed', 'comedy', 'darker', 'material', 'time', 'audiences', 'responded', 'War', 'Roses', 'more', 'subversive', 'corrosive', 'films', 'however', 'film', 'marred', 'rather', 'heavy-handed', 'dose', 'misogyny', 'coincidence', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'written', 'men', 'DeVito', 'Michael', 'Leeson', 'respectively', 'still', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'comedy', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'queasy', 'Demme', 'Allen', 'films', 'THE', 'WAR', 'THE', 'ROSES', 'havoc', 'value', 'systems', 'forces', 'face', 'up', 'resulting', 'mayhem', 'alternative', 'title', 'film', 'uttered', 'Turner', 'one', 'point', 'originally', 'credited', 'Dorothy', 'Parker', 'could', 'be', 'What', 'fresh', 'hell']",N/A
