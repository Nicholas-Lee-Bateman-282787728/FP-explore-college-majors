947456,A2GVM2T7J83D22,B000BPK2NY,Amazon Customer,"[6, 6]","I really enjoyed the Songs that John did by himself.  All the background singers and band members seemed to draw the attention away from his vocals.  I debated on whether to give it 3 stars or 4 and I finally decided on 4 because he sings so well and the lyrics stir you.  The Blu Ray edition looks beautiful in High Definition, and it sounds superb.  They did a good job packaging this DVD full of beautiful songs.  If you enjoyed hearing John Legend on CD or on the Radio, check out this Well edited, well shot film.",4,"Well Shot, Great Energy, Fantastic Voice",1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,518,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'Songs', 'John', 'did', 'background', 'singers', 'band', 'members', 'seemed', 'draw', 'attention', 'away', 'vocals', 'debated', 'give', '3', 'stars', '4', 'finally', 'decided', '4', 'so', 'well', 'lyrics', 'stir', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'edition', 'beautiful', 'High', 'Definition', 'superb', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'full', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'John', 'Legend', 'CD', 'Radio', 'check', 'out', 'Well', 'edited', 'well', 'shot', 'film']",N/A

Kenny, Chris Rob, Tara Michelle, Swiss Chris, Sharief, and the rest of his band are amazing musicians and I cannot wait for a full 5.1 presentation of his amazing live show.  Both the shows I have been to have been viewed from back stage and it's a great vantage point but I would love to see the full show and from the cover of this Dvd it looks like it's gunna be a great buy.1 please!-Ashton",5,Great Dvd,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,564,"['have', ""n't"", 'viewed', 'yet', 'have', 'seen', 'John', 'play', 'many', 'times', 'including', 'performance', '3', 'days', 'dvd', 'was', 'filmed', 'band', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'Kenny', 'Chris', 'Rob', 'Tara', 'Michelle', 'Swiss', 'Chris', 'Sharief', 'rest', 'band', 'are', 'amazing', 'musicians', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'full', '5.1', 'presentation', 'amazing', 'live', 'show', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'have', 'been', 'viewed', 'back', 'stage', 'great', 'vantage', 'point', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'full', 'show', 'cover', 'Dvd', 'gunna', 'be', 'great', 'buy.1', 'please', '-Ashton']",N/A

947460,A8Q3M6FHASIJ7,B000BPK2NY,Ms. 90,"[2, 3]","John Legend is an amazingly wonderful talented brother!  This DVD will not disappoint his fans as he performs almost all of the songs from the Get Lifted disc.  Legend is a vision in white as he takes the stage for this almost 90 minute set which showcases his strong and raspy vocals along with his skill at the piano.  He keeps his audience hyped as they sing along with him, shouting the choruses, and breaking into huge applause as Kanye West and Snoop Dogg make guest appearances.  Legend and his band are great performers and do Get Lifted great justice with the live versions of the songs, but Legend is clearly at his best when it's just his vocals and the piano.  His renditions of Ordinary People and Again - from the Once Again CD are nothing short of magical.  His reggae twist of Used To Love You is a treat, as well.  This live DVD is a good addition to your DVD collection, but to truly understand what is special about this young man, you have to see him live.",4,Dude's Got The Goods!,1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,976,"['John', 'Legend', 'amazingly', 'wonderful', 'talented', 'brother', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'fans', 'almost', 'songs', 'Get', 'Lifted', 'disc', 'Legend', 'vision', 'white', 'stage', 'almost', '90', 'minute', 'set', 'strong', 'raspy', 'vocals', 'skill', 'piano', 'audience', 'hyped', 'sing', 'shouting', 'choruses', 'breaking', 'huge', 'applause', 'Kanye', 'West', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'make', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Legend', 'band', 'are', 'great', 'performers', 'do', 'Get', 'Lifted', 'great', 'justice', 'live', 'versions', 'songs', 'Legend', 'clearly', 'best', 'when', 'just', 'vocals', 'piano', 'renditions', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Again', 'Once', 'Again', 'CD', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'magical', 'reggae', 'twist', 'Used', 'Love', 'treat', 'well', 'live', 'DVD', 'good', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'truly', 'understand', 'what', 'special', 'young', 'man', 'have', 'see', 'live']",N/A
