458788,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305300550,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","As a devoted Ferrell fan my wife insisted that I finally get around to watching `Night at the Roxbury'.  Honestly, how can you claim to worship the comedian if you have never seen his earliest work?  So I made my way down to my local video store and rummaged through the videos until I found this DVD hidden behind a slew of less impressive fodder and made my way up to the checkout line.  Upon seeing the video I was renting the young girl checking me out starting to involuntarily bob her head to the side and hum the tune of some 90's dance track and I knew that I was in for a cult classic.  To label `Night at the Roxbury' a cult classic may not sit well with everyone, but to be completely honest it is the film that launched the mega-successful career of Will Ferrell, and that alone is worth mentioning.  Do I think `Night at the Roxbury' is Ferrell's funniest film?  No, but I do think that this was one heck of a start for his career and watching this film further proves that he's always had it.The movie centers around brothers Doug and Steve Butabi (no...yes).  As has been mentioned, this film, along with so many others starring the SNL alumni, is just an expansion of their SNL skits.  These two brothers are as lame as lame can be, but in their own eyes they are the coolest cats on the block.  Doug, played by Chris Kattan, is the ringleader.  He's the more independent outspoken brother.  Ferrell's Steve is more of a follower, gullible and nave and easily manipulated.  They work in their father's fake-plant shop but their real dream is to one day open their own night club.  After a chance meeting with the owner of the popular club `The Roxbury' they find themselves one step closer to their dream but when their father, the girl next door and a bitter rival come between them and their nightclub they find themselves torn apart and their spirits, along with their dreams, begin to crumble.This film is hilarious in scenes, corny in most, and just plain ridiculous some of the time, but as some have already mentioned, this is just good goofy fun.  This is not the type of film to take seriously so why bother trying to.  Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan are hilarious here.  In fact, Kattan is so funny that I'm surprised his career didn't skyrocket as well.  It's funny to me to watch this film and see how it helped launch Ferrell's career yet Kattan hasn't done much more than the ill-received and poorly orchestrated Corky Romano.  Molly Shannon is also great here as the seductive manipulating girl after Steve's heart and the prospect of a family business venture.  To any fan of SNL or Ferrell will want to see this, as I'm sure they already have.  Now I can really say I'm a fan of Ferrell, a big fan, for I've seen his most recognized film, the film that started it all, and I can honestly say that from the dialog to the soundtrack it's a winner.",3,Responsible for launching the career of one of my favorite comedians...,1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,2877,"['devoted', 'Ferrell', 'fan', 'wife', 'insisted', 'finally', 'get', 'watching', 'Night', 'Roxbury', 'Honestly', 'how', 'can', 'claim', 'worship', 'comedian', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'earliest', 'work', 'So', 'made', 'way', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'rummaged', 'videos', 'found', 'DVD', 'hidden', 'slew', 'less', 'impressive', 'fodder', 'made', 'way', 'checkout', 'line', 'seeing', 'video', 'was', 'renting', 'young', 'girl', 'checking', 'starting', 'involuntarily', 'bob', 'head', 'side', 'hum', 'tune', '90', 'dance', 'track', 'knew', 'was', 'cult', 'classic', 'label', 'Night', 'Roxbury', 'cult', 'classic', 'may', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'everyone', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'film', 'launched', 'mega-successful', 'career', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'alone', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Do', 'think', 'Night', 'Roxbury', 'Ferrell', 'funniest', 'film', 'No', 'do', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'heck', 'start', 'career', 'watching', 'film', 'further', 'always', 'had', 'it.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'brothers', 'Doug', 'Steve', 'Butabi', 'yes', 'been', 'mentioned', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'starring', 'SNL', 'alumni', 'just', 'expansion', 'SNL', 'skits', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'as', 'lame', 'lame', 'can', 'be', 'own', 'eyes', 'are', 'coolest', 'cats', 'block', 'Doug', 'played', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'ringleader', 'more', 'independent', 'outspoken', 'brother', 'Ferrell', 'Steve', 'more', 'follower', 'gullible', 'nave', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'work', 'father', 'fake-plant', 'shop', 'real', 'dream', 'one', 'day', 'open', 'own', 'night', 'club', 'chance', 'meeting', 'owner', 'popular', 'club', 'Roxbury', 'find', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'dream', 'when', 'father', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'bitter', 'rival', 'come', 'nightclub', 'find', 'torn', 'apart', 'spirits', 'dreams', 'begin', 'crumble.This', 'film', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'corny', 'most', 'just', 'plain', 'ridiculous', 'time', 'have', 'already', 'mentioned', 'just', 'good', 'goofy', 'fun', 'not', 'type', 'film', 'take', 'seriously', 'so', 'why', 'bother', 'trying', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'are', 'hilarious', 'here', 'fact', 'Kattan', 'so', 'funny', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'career', 'did', ""n't"", 'skyrocket', 'as', 'well', 'funny', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'helped', 'launch', 'Ferrell', 'career', 'yet', 'Kattan', ""n't"", 'done', 'much', 'more', 'ill-received', 'poorly', 'orchestrated', 'Corky', 'Romano', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'also', 'great', 'here', 'seductive', 'manipulating', 'girl', 'Steve', 'heart', 'prospect', 'family', 'business', 'venture', 'fan', 'SNL', 'Ferrell', 'will', 'want', 'see', ""'m"", 'sure', 'already', 'have', 'Now', 'can', 'really', 'say', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Ferrell', 'big', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'recognized', 'film', 'film', 'started', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'dialog', 'soundtrack', 'winner']",A Night at the Roxbury VHS

But my mom came across a copy of 1998's ""A Night At The Roxbury"", based on a popular sketch featuring Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan. I watched it, not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the outcome.Anyone who saw the sketch on ""SNL"" knew that the Roxbury Guys sketch was the last one anyone expected to be made into a movie. On the show, the sketch basically had Doug (Kattan) and Steve (Ferrell) Butabi club hopping and head bopping to techno music and often featured little to no dialogue. However, thanks to smart writing and great performances from Ferrell and Kattan, ""A Night At The Roxbury"" ranks as one of the better movies based on an ""SNL"" sketch.The Butabi brothers are club hoopers with small brains and big dreams. Their dream is to get into the mecca of all clubs: the Roxbury. However, they are not ""cool enough"" to get on the guest list. Plus, they face increasing contempt from their dad (Dan Hedaya), who wants them to take over the family's floral business. One night, they get into a car accident with Richard Grieco (playing himself). In order to get out of being sued, Grieco manages to get them into the Roxbury, where they meet the owner. They discuss potential business ideas with the owner, and are ont he verge of creating a successful club of their own. But family problems and a scheming bodyguard (Colin Quinn), keeps them from fulfilling their dream. From here on in, it's predictable, but it still remains a laugh riot.The bottom line is, if you enjoy laughing yourself silly, then ""A Night At The Roxbury"" is the movie for you.",5,Surprisingly Good,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,1754,"['Wayne', 'World', '2', 'Pat', 'Superstar', 'kind', 'wrote', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'related', 'movies', 'first', 'Wayne', 'World', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'mom', 'came', 'copy', '1998', 'A', 'Night', 'Roxbury', 'based', 'popular', 'sketch', 'featuring', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'watched', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'outcome.Anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'sketch', 'SNL', 'knew', 'Roxbury', 'Guys', 'sketch', 'was', 'last', 'one', 'anyone', 'expected', 'be', 'made', 'movie', 'show', 'sketch', 'basically', 'had', 'Doug', 'Kattan', 'Steve', 'Ferrell', 'Butabi', 'club', 'hopping', 'head', 'bopping', 'techno', 'music', 'often', 'featured', 'little', 'dialogue', 'However', 'thanks', 'smart', 'writing', 'great', 'performances', 'Ferrell', 'Kattan', 'Night', 'Roxbury', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'based', 'SNL', 'sketch.The', 'Butabi', 'brothers', 'are', 'club', 'hoopers', 'small', 'brains', 'big', 'dreams', 'dream', 'get', 'mecca', 'clubs', 'Roxbury', 'However', 'are', 'not', 'cool', 'enough', 'get', 'guest', 'list', 'face', 'increasing', 'contempt', 'dad', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'who', 'take', 'over', 'family', 'floral', 'business', 'One', 'night', 'get', 'car', 'accident', 'Richard', 'Grieco', 'playing', 'order', 'get', 'being', 'sued', 'Grieco', 'get', 'Roxbury', 'where', 'meet', 'owner', 'discuss', 'potential', 'business', 'ideas', 'owner', 'are', 'verge', 'creating', 'successful', 'club', 'own', 'family', 'problems', 'scheming', 'bodyguard', 'Colin', 'Quinn', 'fulfilling', 'dream', 'here', 'predictable', 'still', 'laugh', 'riot.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'enjoy', 'laughing', 'silly', 'then', 'A', 'Night', 'Roxbury', 'movie']",A Night at the Roxbury VHS

The disco guys with the bobbing heads certainly had the potential to wear thin after just a few skits, so I had my doubts that there would be enough material here to sustain a complete feature film.  Surprisingly enough, there is - and the brothers' shtick never really grows old.For brothers Steve and Doug Butabi (Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan), life is all about hitting the clubs every night.  By day, they work - reluctantly - for their father at his silk flower shop.  Pops wants Steve to settle down and marry Emily, the girl next door (Molly Shannon) and bring about a merger of the two family businesses into a lamp and flower store, but Steve just wants to hang out with his more reckless and even dumber brother, dance the nights away, and maybe even pick up a woman successfully someday.  Privately, the brothers dream of opening their own night club - but they're stymied by the fact that they have never even been able to gain admittance at the Roxbury, the cream of the night club crop.  Then fate steps in and Richard Grieco gets them in and even introduces them to Mr. Zahir, the club's owner.  Suddenly, it looks like their ship may finally have come in - until the following day, when everything starts to crumble.  Will the brothers go their separate ways?

Kattan and Ferrell did a good job of giving these sketch characters personality because as I remember this on SNL episodes, the only thing rhat they would do is their silly dance.  It was good to see this get a good a transition from SNL sketch comedy to film.Kattan and Ferrell (Doug and Steve Butobi) are 2 brothers that have 3 goals in life. 1) Look Good, 2) Build their own club and 3) Get into the Roxbury, a high class guest list only night club.  After meeting 80's TV icon Richard Greico (played by himself), they finally get a taste of the Roxbury and they get to know the man that owns the club.  He then wants to set up a meeting with them but his assistant (Colin Quinn) wants to make sure that they don't ever get the chance.  So now, the Butobi boys have to find the owner, set up the meeting and make their lives complete by owning their own club.This one is pretty funny.  Out of the wave of new SNL spin off movies (SUPERSTAR, LADIE'S MAN and BLUES BROTHERS 2000). NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY is one of my favorites.  It's not my all time favorite SNL spin off (WAYNE'S WORLD all the way!) but it is worth it and it has some great laughs in it as well.For those of you who are familiar to this sketch, this gets a big thumbs up and to those of you who aren't familiar with this one, you might want to rent it first because I've known a few people that didn't like this one because they didn't know what the concept behind this movie was.

They try too much to live up to the greats (Chris Farely, David Spade, Mike Meyers, Adam Sandler, Dana Carvey, etc.)but they don't realize that they will never be as funny as them. This movie is a perfect example of that. SNL went from actual humor to just 2 hours of ongoing sex jokes. Although I did laugh at the Roxbury SNL skits, this movie just made me dissapointed, along with other SNL movies like Superstar and a couple others. They should just give up now.

This movie copies the Austin Powers formula of satire targeting the late 60's. This time it's target is the  plastic polyester of the disco 70's and club music 80's with two goofball  out of place throwbacks. The biggest problem with this movie is it's poorly  written script. The jokes are so predictable you find yourself only  laughing at the slapstick. Two brothers who are dumber than Jim Carrey was  in 'Dumb and Dumber&quot; work for their father in a flower shop by day and  put on 70's clothes to  hit the LA circuit by night. They are refused  admittance at the hot club called the Roxbury primarily because they wish  to cut the line as VIP's. They should have just waited like everybody else.  They meet Richard Greiko via a fender bender and go in with him. The club  owner is a victim of his environment probably too many drugs and has some  funny lines. Overall except for a few stock jokes and good slapsick this  movie tries too hard to be funny but the characters are not defined enough  to be believable so it resembles a bad B movie at times.
