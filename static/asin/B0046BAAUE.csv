1387591,A3U5Z6UTIJ8FZ9,B0046BAAUE,"1.5 Trick Pony ""SuperDuper""","[17, 20]","I will start by saying that I love Tracey Mallet's other exercise video - I use her 6 Minute Quickblast DVDs more than any other exercise videos I own.  I thought I could trust that her approach to fitness was a stairstep one, starting at the ""doable"" and working up to the ""darn hard but I'm proud I just did that"" stages.Unfortunately I really feel let down by The Booty Barre, and I think that anyone without significant ballet background should steer clear.  I noticed that most of the positive reviews are by people who mention former ballet training... which I think tells you something.  So rule of thumb for Booty Barre: beginners at ballet, no way; experienced at ballet, go for it.If I were Tracey Mallet, I'd redo this video with two levels - beginner and advanced - and for the beginner, begin with the really basic moves, but instead of focusing on only one muscle until total muscle failure (read: setting us up for failure), I'd mix it up with different target muscles.  Oh, and stop moving the camer so that the only backup person who is not a professional ballerina is NOT cut out of virtually every shot, we need to see how she is doing it both to see how normal human beings (not Gumby) do the moves, and for moral support. Oh, and not have a professional ballerina as your ""modification"" person when she is actually outdoing Tracey in every single move (not exaggerating! She lifts her leg higher, goes deeper, every time).When I started thinking ""Tracey, what on earth is wrong with you?!"" when only halfway through the *warmup*, I knew there was a problem.  I actually exercise quite a bit (running, swimming, lifting weights, general aerobics, some biking), I just don't happen to use those specific muscles that ballet uses (e.g. the ability to stand on tiptoe - not really much in demand elsewhere), and I really can't imagine that anyone other than a dancer has those muscles built up either.  After the first 5? 10? minutes of nonstop moves on tiptoe with no break, my calf muscles were knotting and jumping; same later with the  leg raises (I forget the ballet terms) and the arms and - well you get the point. I could have done it if there had been some mixup - tiptoe, leg raises, arms, etc all mixed up.  But I did not start out able to do those moves or with those muscles built up, so guess what - I can't do a whole whole whole whole lotta those moves in a row.  Why on earth wouldn't she mix it up? I'm honestly baffled about what Tracey Mallet was thinking.I know some people would say ""well then just don't do them"" but that is really bad psychology, and lazy video-making.  I did as long as I could, and then stopped - completely. I had no belief that I could just fast forward and be able to do the next segment.  I tried a few days later, promising myself I just had to make it halfway through, and had to stop again.  Both times I felt like a total failure and was so very discouraged.  I just don't see any way for me to be able to do this video, and there is no motivation to even try since I feel like it sets me up for failure.  I'm giving away this video, and going back to my old routines.  To say I'm discouraged is a very big understatement, and I'm also really surprised (in a bad way) that Tracey Mallet would put out this kind of a video.Sorry to be so negative, as I said before I really liked Tracey Mallet's other exercise videos, I just thought this one was a real dud for ballet newbies.",2,Discouraging for Ballet Newbies,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,3444,"['will', 'start', 'saying', 'love', 'Tracey', 'Mallet', 'other', 'exercise', 'video', 'use', '6', 'Minute', 'Quickblast', 'DVDs', 'more', 'other', 'exercise', 'videos', 'own', 'thought', 'could', 'trust', 'approach', 'fitness', 'was', 'stairstep', 'one', 'starting', 'doable', 'working', 'up', 'darn', 'hard', ""'m"", 'proud', 'just', 'did', 'stages.Unfortunately', 'really', 'feel', 'let', 'down', 'Booty', 'Barre', 'think', 'anyone', 'significant', 'ballet', 'background', 'should', 'steer', 'clear', 'noticed', 'most', 'positive', 'reviews', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'mention', 'former', 'ballet', 'training', 'think', 'tells', 'something', 'So', 'rule', 'thumb', 'Booty', 'Barre', 'beginners', 'ballet', 'way', 'experienced', 'ballet', 'go', 'it.If', 'were', 'Tracey', 'Mallet', ""'d"", 'redo', 'video', 'two', 'levels', 'beginner', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'begin', 'really', 'basic', 'moves', 'instead', 'focusing', 'only', 'one', 'muscle', 'total', 'muscle', 'failure', 'read', 'setting', 'up', 'failure', ""'d"", 'mix', 'up', 'different', 'target', 'muscles', 'Oh', 'stop', 'moving', 'camer', 'only', 'backup', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'professional', 'ballerina', 'NOT', 'cut', 'virtually', 'shot', 'need', 'see', 'how', 'doing', 'see', 'how', 'normal', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'Gumby', 'do', 'moves', 'moral', 'support', 'Oh', 'not', 'have', 'professional', 'ballerina', 'modification', 'person', 'when', 'actually', 'outdoing', 'Tracey', 'single', 'move', 'not', 'exaggerating', 'leg', 'higher', 'deeper', 'time', '.When', 'started', 'thinking', 'Tracey', 'what', 'earth', 'wrong', 'when', 'only', 'halfway', '*warmup*', 'knew', 'was', 'problem', 'actually', 'exercise', 'quite', 'bit', 'running', 'swimming', 'lifting', 'weights', 'general', 'aerobics', 'biking', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'happen', 'use', 'specific', 'muscles', 'ballet', 'uses', 'e.g', 'ability', 'stand', 'tiptoe', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'demand', 'elsewhere', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'other', 'dancer', 'muscles', 'built', 'up', 'first', '5', '10', 'minutes', 'nonstop', 'moves', 'tiptoe', 'break', 'calf', 'muscles', 'were', 'knotting', 'jumping', 'same', 'later', 'leg', 'forget', 'ballet', 'terms', 'arms', 'well', 'get', 'point', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'had', 'been', 'mixup', 'tiptoe', 'leg', 'raises', 'arms', 'etc', 'mixed', 'up', 'did', 'not', 'start', 'out', 'able', 'do', 'moves', 'muscles', 'built', 'up', 'so', 'guess', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'whole', 'whole', 'whole', 'lotta', 'moves', 'row', 'Why', 'earth', 'would', ""n't"", 'mix', 'up', ""'m"", 'honestly', 'baffled', 'what', 'Tracey', 'Mallet', 'was', 'thinking.I', 'know', 'people', 'would', 'say', 'well', 'then', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'really', 'bad', 'psychology', 'lazy', 'video-making', 'did', 'as', 'long', 'could', 'then', 'stopped', 'completely', 'had', 'belief', 'could', 'just', 'fast', 'forward', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'next', 'segment', 'tried', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'promising', 'just', 'had', 'make', 'halfway', 'had', 'stop', 'again', 'Both', 'times', 'felt', 'total', 'failure', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'discouraged', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'video', 'motivation', 'even', 'try', 'feel', 'up', 'failure', ""'m"", 'giving', 'away', 'video', 'going', 'back', 'old', 'routines', 'say', ""'m"", 'discouraged', 'very', 'big', 'understatement', ""'m"", 'also', 'really', 'surprised', 'bad', 'way', 'Tracey', 'Mallet', 'would', 'put', 'out', 'kind', 'video.Sorry', 'be', 'so', 'negative', 'said', 'really', 'liked', 'Tracey', 'Mallet', 'other', 'exercise', 'videos', 'just', 'thought', 'one', 'was', 'real', 'dud', 'ballet', 'newbies']",Tracey Mallett-The Booty Barre-Total New Body

1387593,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0046BAAUE,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[17, 19]","NOTE: I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; you can find a more detailed version of my review on that site.In her introduction, instructor Tracey Mallett explains that she created The Booty Barre workout to combine elements of barre, dance, Pilates, yoga, and kickboxing. Tracey instructs the workout live in a bright indoor studio with four background exercisers. The only props required for this workout are a sturdy chair (for the barre work) and a pair of light (3-5 lb.) dumbbells, although I found a mat to be useful.The Main Menu of the DVD offers options to either Play All or to select each of the four chapters individually. I have described each section of the workout in detail below.Booty Barre Warm-Up (8.5 minutes)This is a fast-moving, active warm-up with a bit of a cardio effect. Tracey starts with several variations on pli&eacute;s, adding in heel lifts and moving from a squat to a standing forward bend. There is also a bit of a dance-like element in swaying the hips from side-to-side. The final sequence includes a flow in and out of a yoga warrior 2 position, from warrior 2 to crescent lunge, and finally from plank to an inverted triangle, or down dog.Booty Barre Sculpted Arms (10 minutes)For the first half of this segment, Tracey quickly moves through some more traditional arms exercises, including side delt raise, overhead press, chest press, rear delt lift, and a unique side/rear delt raise which lifts out of a squat position. The second half focuses almost exclusively on triceps work, although it also includes a front delt raise and long biceps curl.Booty Barre Workout (32.5 minutes)This glute-focused segment is the heart of the workout; a chair is used throughout. In general, Tracey completes a series of exercises on one side, then does the same series with the second leg. For the first 12 minutes of this segment, the setup is sideways, with one hip facing the chair. Some of the pli&eacute;s here are similar to the warm-up moves, but the addition of kicks (from lunge and curtsy lunge positions) makes the work both more challenging and more glute-intensive. This first series concludes with a pulsing rear arabesque/attitude. The second 10 minutes also starts with the side to the chair in wide pli&eacute; for knee lifts. Tracey then performs a squat into a side leg lift, eventually pulsating and rotating towards the chair to change the emphasis from the hips to the glutes and back again, and finally, concluding with a killer ""stork"" kick. With just over 13 minutes left in this segment, Tracey introduces what she calls the ""cardio section."" Using the seat of the chair for balance, this approximately 4-minute segment involves standing in a runner's lunge and rapidly moving one knee in and out plus quick-moving plank variations (e.g., mountain climbers, bunny jumps). For the final standing sequence, Tracey returns to behind the chair for an assortment of moves, from parallel feet to additional pli&eacute;s to bent leg lifts (back and side). The best thing about this segment is that Tracey is constantly changing up the approach: just as you are starting to become too fatigued in one position, she switches to working the glutes from yet another angle.Booty Barre Abs and Flexibility (12.5 minutes)For this section, Tracey and crew begin standing on their knees, briefly lowering and raising from this position to work the core. After some push-ups/plank work, Tracey then performs a series of moves in a seated c-curve position. This is followed by more Pilates-inspired abs exercises, including both the single leg stretch and the single straight leg stretch. Tracey performs a very brief (about 1 minute) series of back extensions before moving into the final stretches. The 4-minute seated stretch sequence includes rock the baby, seated cross-legged forward bend, wide-legged seated forward bend, and wide-legged seated side bend; Tracey concludes standing.One of the background exercisers, Laura, is designated as the modifier, but she actually shows very few modifications--although she doesn't go as deeply into the pli&eacute;s as Tracey, for the kicks, Laura is generally kicking higher than any of the other exercisers, including Tracey herself! This just underscores the fact that The Booty Barre is most appropriate for those at an experienced fitness level. The barre segment in particular is challenging in terms of both strength and stamina, as Tracey keeps you constantly moving, producing a strong cardio effect.Tracey perhaps tried to do a bit too much in this DVD: at just over an hour (approximately 63.5 minutes total), the workout feels a bit long. She might have been better served by making the barre segment a bit shorter and by adding more lower-body focused stretching, which definitely felt lacking. Personally, I loved the arms work and the first 22 minutes or so of the barre section; in the future, I may only use the DVD through that point. Those who like this workout but find it to be too advanced might enjoyXtend Barre: Lean & Chiseled, which is somewhat similar in that it is a fast-paced barre workout that includes an excellent upper body segment.",5,Unique and fun but very tough!,1300752000,"03 22, 2011",2011,5205,"['NOTE', 'received', 'free', 'copy', 'DVD', 'review', 'web', 'site', 'Metapsychology', 'Online', 'Reviews', 'can',

1387597,ALCBH8P6KGN1E,B0046BAAUE,Cynthia,"[3, 3]","I've been doing Pilates for many years, and was long and strong but not cardio fit.  Most cardio exercise seemed so mindless that it bored the pants off of me, or, worse still, was very hard on the joints. Then barre classes appeared in the mainstream a couple of years ago, and I was pleased to find that, although typically termed &#34;toning&#34;, they were very &#34;cardio&#34;, and used your brain as well as your body.  I bought about 8 different barre method videos to try, and this one, the Booty Barre, was by far the most enticing.  I liked it because it worked my butt off but was never boring or discouraging, even though, at the beginning, I had to take frequent breaks of 32 or 64 counts and gasp for breath or stretch out some target muscle.  The instructor, Tracey Mallet, was always encouraging and even said to take little breaks as needed, so I never felt like I was slouching, and, if I couldn't do something as well as shown, there was always someone showing a modified version that I could follow.  It did not take many weeks of daily practice for me to be moving like Tracey.  I junked the other DVDs I'd bought and just did this and the other Booty Barre DVDs which I also purchased.  I love what she has created--it is based on the sound principles of Pilates, is very low impact, is a very well-rounded workout (many of the other barre methods just seem to work glutes and thighs only), and she is so cheery and fun to listen to with her little English accent overlaid with California girl that I find the whole thing very uplifting and have been practicing the Booty Barre ever since, though nowadays about 3 times a week instead of daily.

1387604,A2AC3VJPUZS42C,B0046BAAUE,Jenny G,"[166, 166]","The DVD has four sections:Warmup (8:48):Lots of second position plie variations, including some fast-paced side to side moves.  There is a person doing modifications that does not go down very low in the plies. That modification may help some with tricky knees.  After the plies, she moves into crescent pose variations and then planks pulling back into downward dog. Then something similar to a pulsing warrior 2, before repeating crescent pose, planks, and downward dog on the other side.  The warm up is fast paced, but I found it very doable.Sculpted Arms (9:57):All done standing with dumbbells. She recommends 3 lb weights working up to 5 lbs. I used 5 lbs.  I find some upper body barre routines using weights are a bit light but really liked this one.  While not as intense as Squeeze Stronger, I felt like I got a nice upper body workout. She does traditional exercises, but adds her own twist to make them interesting.Booty Barre Workout (32:41):  Includes:o calf raiseso diamond plie variations, including side to side hip movementso second position plie variationso lunge, and then moving the back leg forward to kick up into the air (similar to grand battement)o curtsy squats with kickso pulsing arabesque/attitude combo for the gluteso figure-4 standing stretcho repeat lunge, curtsy squat, and arabesque/attitude variations, and figure-4 stretch on other sideo second position plie, lifting outside leg up and elbow down to work the obliqueso wide squat pulses kicking leg out to the sideo more standing glute work (just over 2 minutes)o Repeat second position plie/squat/glute work on other sideo The above takes almost 20 minutes and then she moves into cardio. For cardio, she goes into a reverse lunge and then brings the back leg forward. She also includes mountain climbers and a plank variation jumping the legs in and out.o She then moves into the ""final segment"" with parallel thigh plie work and more diamond plieso She closes with some standing stretches, and then more glute work!Abs & Flexibility (12:43)o Knee dancing (this is up and down movement and pulsing, as opposed to leaning back that is done in some barre workouts)o (22) pushups, some slow and some fast (she does these bent knee, I modified to toe pushups)o Ab work (approx. 4 minutes)o Side plank balances (T-stand)o Locust poseo Flexibility starts at about 8:43COMMENTS:  I really had a lot of fun doing this workout.  There is a lot of glute work!!  I didn't feel the intense burn in the thighs I can get from slower paced, small movement, Lotte Berk inspired workouts, but I also think that as I learned this DVD better that might come more with time.  Even without the burn, though, I felt I got a good leg workout.I really like Tracey and think she is a great instructor.  She is energetic and peppy, but not over the top.  She seems like she is having fun, and I did too!It is fast paced but not too much so.  I was able to keep up through the entire workout and didn't have any safety concerns that I might injure myself.  Tracey gives a lot of pointers on form, too, which is nice.  I have a sensitive knee, but was able to do the entire workout. Some with sensitive knees might find parts of the DVD difficult.  Always good to know your limitations, and make adjustments if needed.  I have hip dysplasia and am fairly tight in the hips too, but only had a minor problem with a short segment of the main workout (had to keep my leg lower than hers).  There was a nice cardio pace to most of the workout.My only complaints were that ab work and flexibility section are pretty short.  I did my own stretches after.  But overall, I enjoyed the workout so much that those seem like minor points!

1387606,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B0046BAAUE,Leanne,"[62, 62]","I just got done doing this workout for the first time, and really loved it!  It's my first Tracey Mallett workout, and I really like her personality.  She's friendly and encouraging, and gives excellent form pointers throughout the workout.To do this workout, you'll need a chair and some three- or five-pound hand weights.  A yoga mat is also helpful for the core and stretch section at the very end of the workout.Since another reviewer already gave an excellent breakdown of the workout, I'll just add in that this workout is a great addition to the barre workouts that are already out there.  Although the title of her series (Booty Barre) says that the focus is on the rear end, the actual workout title (Total New Body) gives an indication that it's a full-body workout -- and you will definitely feel every muscle group being worked during the sixty-five minutes!Also, when I read reviews of new workouts, I like to know if they will add something to my fitness library, and this one definitely does.  I'm a barre newbie and have only been doing barre workouts for a few months, so my barre library is pretty limited -- I have the two Physique 57 workout series (six DVD's total),Exhale: Core Fusion - Body Sculpt, the three Squeeze workouts by Tracy Effinger, andROCKIN MODELS Workout DVD with Grace Lazenby, and this one is very different from all of those other workouts.For starters, it's got one of the best upper body/arms sections on any of the above-mentioned workout, except for the upper body segment ofTracy Effinger's Squeeze Stronger (fitness workout).  The upper body section on P57 always seems short to me, but Tracey's workout really works parts of the upper body (including rear delts) more thoroughly.It also has a great cardio factor, almost like the P57 workouts.  In fact, in one segment, she has you use the front of the chair and also the floor to do some cardio moves to get your heart rate up there.A couple of the exercises I've seen in other workouts, but almost everything in this workout was new and fresh to me, and I really felt the moves!

I also have Tracey's beginner barre DVD, and this is a great partner to that.  A little more advanced and yes, Tracey and her gang are way more flexible than I am, but I don't let that stop me, I simply do what I can.  I am sure I am in way worse shape and more overweight than many reviewers here, but I get a great workout and for the most part can keep up (and down the line, I'm sure I'll be able to do the whole thing non-stop).  I do hate planks, and so I do something else (leg kicks or lifts) for the 2 minutes she does them.  There is great legwork - I can't get through most entire routines without a small breather - and I really enjoy the ballet moves, they are what makes this DVD fun for me.  The 10-minute arm segment is my go-to arms, and I try to do that piece every day.  Tracey is a great instructor, fun, motivating and by no means the ""blonde bimbo"" another reviewer proclaimed.  I really don't like to exercise, but I don't mind doing this...and I'm seeing results.EDIT: Since purchasing this DVD I have bought several others, and taken many others out of the library.  This workout I feel is the hardest in my rotation and do it faithfully 3 times a week, and do another DVD the other 4 days.  I'm also watching my diet.  In just under a month I'm seeing 3 inches off my hips, with losses elsewhere as well.  The scale is not moving as fast so I know it's this workout.
