1335470,A2XK9NPCPIF8HJ,B003BEE27E,DBA,"[0, 0]",Iverson did not agree to this film so its not as good as it could have been if he him self were involved. I would say one of the weaker 30 for 30 films and not much depth to it because its mostly covering the brawl. Even if an Iverson fan you might be disappointed with this one!,3,Could have been better,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,279,"['Iverson', 'did', 'not', 'agree', 'film', 'so', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'were', 'involved', 'would', 'say', 'one', 'weaker', '30', '30', 'films', 'not', 'much', 'depth', 'mostly', 'covering', 'brawl', 'Even', 'Iverson', 'fan', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'one']",N/A

High points for me were , Allen getting his High School education (and the uplifting story about that) and the fact that Mr. Iverson made good and got some happy and got to be a pro athlete . All great stuff . I wanted to know about Allen Iverson the human being and man . The focus of this 30 ""films by"" 30 filmmakers was FAR too narrow and negative for me . Tell me the man's story for goodness sake . One incident does not a film made nor is a life defined by . Very disappointing film to me .

I Thought that Steve James did an exceptional impartial job of reporting the trial and life of Allen Iverson from Newport News Virginia were the director was from. I definitely recommend that you watch this unfold and your make your on judgment!

He probably represents all that was wrong with basketball in the late 90's  to early 2000's period. The focus on individual heroics and showing off over team effort and wins. That said - this documentary does an excellent job of humanizing him and showing the other side. Most basketball fans will really enjoy this in depth look at Iverson's career with the focus on his early days.,4,Evenhanded,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,421,"['personally', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Iverson', 'probably', 'was', 'wrong', 'basketball', 'late', '90', 'early', '2000', 'period', 'focus', 'individual', 'heroics', 'showing', 'off', 'team', 'effort', 'wins', 'said', 'documentary', 'excellent', 'job', 'humanizing', 'showing', 'other', 'side', 'Most', 'basketball', 'fans', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'depth', 'look', 'Iverson', 'career', 'focus', 'early', 'days']",N/A
