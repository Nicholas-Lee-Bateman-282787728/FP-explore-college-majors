1667972,A1DG75OT3Y49EM,B00ENP6I9U,"ashertopia ""@gmail .com""","[14, 14]","Cue blurred scene. A male body is lying on the ground in a pool of blood. A woman is crying out, holding him. Police rush in and arrest her. Voice over: I watched my best friend die. This is not your average vanilla Christian movie.Brendan King (Crawford Wilson) found Jesus and true faith serving time after the police arrested him - when his friend from his gang was shot in the opening scene - and is given one last chance to find a home; his 18th foster home. Mike (James McDaniel) and Vanessa (Lynn Whitfield) lost their policeman son four years ago when he stopped a car and was shot and killed by the driver. Mike hasn't given up on trusting God that there is a plan that included the tragic loss of their son and sees Brendan as a way to serve God and His plan. Vanessa still struggles with the loss and with the idea that a God who loves them would take her son. When Mike brings home Brendan it causes a schism of priorities between Mike and Vanessa.Brendan, for all his arrests, felonies and gang affiliations, seems genuinely committed to his faith. He joins the local school Bible study / Christian group, the Seekers, and takes humble work mowing the playing fields at school. When Brendon saves prom queen Natalie (Kayla Compton) from her wrecked car before it burned he find acceptance and friendship and above all - hope that he has finally found a way out of his past life. Then his gang shows up.[SPOILERS] Eli (Brandon Correa), a member of the same gang Brendan belonged to, wants a stash of drugs that Brendan and their slain gangmember hid prior to the bust. Brendan doesn't want the drugs out on the street, but when Eli and his crew start hurting Brendan's friends, and beat him badly, he decides to take the gang out to the drug stash then kill them. Mike, who doesn't know about the details only the difficult decisions, told Brendan that he needs to rely on God, but Brendan feels that this is the only way. [END SPOILERS]This is a &#34;Christian&#34; movie that defies stereotypes. It isn't cheesy and the resolution seems more realistic than many miracle-at-the-last-second stories. This film is full of violence, drugs, sexuality (including an admission by one of the characters of having an abortion). Non-Christians may still look at the story and think parts of it are too good to be true, but that's the difference between degenerate and regenerate thinking. God really is too good to be true.One thing I struggled with was the casting in the story. Brendan, Crawford Wilson, is such a clean cut, earnest white guy that it is hard to envision him as a thug drug dealer. Crawford is straight out of 90210's preppy school of acting that even with (obviously fake) tattoos and a couple scars he just isn't able to pull off the complexity of the character. I bought earnest Christian. I didn't buy thug.This story is well acted by the other actors, especially the sinister Eli, Brandon Correa, mentor Mike, James McDaniel, and hurt mother Vanessa, Lynn Whitfield. I especially liked that Brendan was already saved and dealing with consequences from his previous actions - something that Christians sometimes gloss over suggesting that faith fixes everything, which is not true.This is perhaps the best Christian film of recent years.

But he found a faith that turned his life around while spending time in the juvenile penitentiary.Fresh out of prison he finds hope and security in a new foster home and friends that share his beliefs, but his ties to the past threaten to drag him down, especially when it begins to threaten the lives of those he loves.King's Faith is a fantastic film, with a compelling plot, and many talented actors. I've seen a lot of Christian films, and sadly I couldn't always in good faith recommend them, but King's Faith is completely different. It has a strong message of faith that strikes a perfect balance in that it isn't overly preachy, yet it wasn't flimsy in its message in a Hallmark card kinda way like other films have been. King's Faith conveyed a strong message of faith, that fit perfectly into the setting and plot.This movie is honestly the best Christian movie I have seen in a long time, the storytelling was inspiring, compelling, and powerful, this is a movie that I could rewatch multiple times because it was just so well done from the story, and filming, to the fantastic actors.The reason that this movie is rated PG-13 is because of three scenes of violence. The opening scene shows a blurry flashback of Brendan's old life and how he watched a friend die in his own blood. And two scenes where a gun is waved around a in a forcefully threatening manner. There wasn't any swearing or innuendoes, or sex. But because of the violent scenes parents should let their kids watch this only with discretion, because it may not be good for younger children.Overall though, I give this movie a full 5 stars, and would heartily recommend it to anyone who will listen!

It's not his age but the number of foster home's he's been in and he's hoping that he will finally find a place to call home, not just a temporary stop in life. Yet for Brendan, he's had to grow up fast and see things that many hope never to encounter in life. After losing his mother to drugs and alcohol and watching her die and never knowing who his father is, he goes with whatever family he can find. For Brendan, that would mean gangs. Gang members looked out for one another and were there for you when family wasn't. At least that is what he always believed.Now after being released from prison after a drug raid that left his best friend dead, Brendan believes he discovered his new lease on life. It began when the only book he could have in prison was a Bible given to him from a pastor. Having nothing else to do and no hope for a future, Brendan discovered that there is someone who will never leave you and one that offers the life he always dreamed even if he never discovered it from his own family. Armed with trying a new path to life, he becomes a foster child to Mike and Vee who have suffered their own loss, their son who died as a police officer when a traffic stop resulted in being shot by gang members.Now if Brendan can only convince his foster parent's that he has changed along with the kids in his new high school who wonder just how true the rumors are about him. However just as he's hoping for a positive change, the local sheriff keeps a close eye out believing no one can reform and eventually will fall back into their old ways. When Brendan's gang members are released from prison they come back around searching for a drug stash they believe that Brendan has hidden. Will he be able to hold fast to the faith he has found or will old habits call him back?I received King's Faith by Provident Films and FlyBy Promotions for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed are strictly my own. While this is a Christian based film, the subject matter deals with gangs and drugs and may not be suitable for all members of your family. Parental discretion is strongly advised but it does open up conversations for parents of teens to have with their children regarding the circumstances surrounding the issues Brendan faces not only from peer pressure from his old life but also in dealing with defending his faith to people who don't believe he's changed for the better. In this DVD extra's are some clips that can be used for Bible Study purposes as well as a discussion guide link for more resources. My 14-year-old daughter watched this with us and found it worth watching because is deals with the very things happening within our high school and she got to see an positive alternative by the end of the film both in the way of second chances and in how God can come through when you least expect it.

1667988,A10UPYF30K74H0,B00ENP6I9U,"Trinity Rose ""book lover""","[6, 6]","King&#8217;s Faith on DVD is an excellent movie full of action, suspense, faith and love. It tells a story of Brendan who had no family and got involved in a bad life with many bad decisions.  In was in and out of many foster families and finally got put in a juvenile penitentiary. While there he became a Christian. When he gets out he has his last chance.Friends from  Brendan&#8217;s past look him up and try to get him to become involved again. They try to pressure  Brendan by going after his new friends.What will become of him and his faith now that he&#8217;s out?This is a very entertaining DVD and full of action. It captured my young adults attention and they really enjoyed it.  A really nice movie to watch with the whole family. Even though it is a Christian film the acting and scenes are very professionally done.King&#8217;s Faith tells us that with Jesus we have second chances and life can be good and fulfilling. You don&#8217;t have to be angry all of the time or out to get everyone.
