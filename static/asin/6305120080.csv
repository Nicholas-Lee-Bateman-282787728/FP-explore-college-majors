449229,AKHJVOYEX6QME,6305120080,"Colleen McMahon ""&#34;Omnivorous Reader&#34;""","[27, 27]","Some of the other reviews here are by people with much more knowledge of the Hasidic way of life than I have, and point out problems with things said in the movie that went right by me.  So my perspective in reviewing this is as a curious outsider with some understanding of Judaism, a little understanding of the Hasidic path, and the curiosity to know more.A Life Apart: Hasidism in America is a window into the insular Hasidic communities of New York City.  Narrated by Leonard Nimoy and Sarah Jessica Parker (I was rather shocked by the choice of SJP--could they have found anyone more a polar opposite of the women portrayed in this film than the woman who brought Carrie Bradshaw to life?  But both Nimoy and Parker do a very good job and have excellent ""documentary"" voices for narrating) the film is an overview of the Hasidic way of life as a whole, focusing on a few representative members talking about their own paths.On the whole I found it very enjoyable and educational, and learned a lot from it.  For someone with little to no knowledge of Hasidim but some curiosity, it is a great introduction.  There is a historical overview of the origination and philosophy of the Hasidic way and the destruction of much of it in the era of the Soviets and the Nazis.  I was surprised to learn that Hasids steadfastly refused to emigrate to America, viewing it as a place that endangered their souls with its secularity, even up to the brink the Holocaust.  I had sort of thought that there was something of a Hasidic community in New York pre World War II, that grew and deepened with the arrival of postwar refugees.  But in reality, it was entirely a movement of postwar refugees and a few charismatic rebbes who gathered in the traumatized survivors and helped them recreate communities on this side of the ocean.  The size and fervor of the communities that have emerged after 60 years is a testament to their work and to the will to survive as individuals and people.I found Jack Gold, the patriarch of a large Hasidic family, to be one of the most interesting people in the documentary.  He looks like an Orthodox rather than Hasidic Jew, wearing a kippah but without the hat, beard or side curls that his sons and grandsons wear.  But like them, his appearance is as much a testament to his own journey--from concentration camp survivor who had lost all religion, to someone who began to embrace it again in order to give his children something, but who still wears the scars of his own life.  As one of his sons says, he may not look it on the outside but he has a Hasidic heart.While the glimpses of the various ceremonies and festivals were fascinating and give a hint to the level of joy in the Hasidic style of worship, the lack of explanation as to what was going on and what festival was being celebrated could often be confusing.  Footage jumps from Sukkot to Purim to a wedding to Shabbos to Chanukah with no explanation as to what you are seeing and what it all means.  I recommend watching the documentary once through and then with the directors commentary because it adds a lot to the understanding of these scenes.  But I shouldn't undermine the accomplishment that having any of these scenes is, because as a rule the Hasidim keep to themselves and do not like to interact with or be filmed or photographed by outsiders.But even with the commentary I was often left with more questions--particularly about the roles of women.  The relatively few glimpses of the Hasidic women and insights into their lives left me wanting more, and I was also interested in the hints in both the documentary and commentary about the family members who had left the Hasid community (they had one female representative but even here there wasn't enough detail--I could have enjoyed an entire documentary just about her and her life) and people who had been raised less religious who had joined the Hasid community (again, there was one representative but I was particularly curious about the women who have done so and what the attraction and the result was for them).On the whole this is a good introduction to both the joys and the difficulties and tensions of this way of life and is recommended for anyone curious about it.",4,Great Introduction but Left me with more Questions...,1136937600,"01 11, 2006",2006,4236,"['other', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'people', 'much', 'more', 'knowledge', 'Hasidic', 'way', 'life', 'have', 'point', 'out', 'problems', 'things', 'said', 'movie', 'went', 'right', 'perspective', 'reviewing', 'curious', 'outsider', 'understanding', 'Judaism', 'little', 'understanding', 'Hasidic', 'path', 'curiosity', 'know', 'more.A', 'Life', 'Apart', 'Hasidism', 'America', 'window', 'insular', 'Hasidic', 'communities', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Narrated', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'was', 'rather', 'shocked', 'choice', 'SJP', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'anyone', 'more', 'polar', 'opposite', 'women', 'portrayed', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'brought', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'life', 'Nimoy', 'Parker', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'have', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'voices', 'narrating', 'film', 'overview', 'Hasidic', 'way', 'life', 'whole', 'focusing', 'few', 'representative', 'members', 'talking', 'own', 'paths.On', 'whole', 'found', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'educational', 'learned', 'lot', 'someone', 'little', 'knowledge', 'Hasidim', 'curiosity', 'great', 'introduction', 'historical', 'overview', 'origination', 'philosophy', 'Hasidic', 'way', 'destruction', 'much', 'era', 'Soviets', 'Nazis', 'was', 'surprised', 'learn', 'Hasids', 'steadfastly', 'refused', 'emigrate', 'America', 'viewing', 'place', 'endangered', 'souls', 'secularity', 'even', 'brink', 'Holocaust', 'had', 'sort', 'thought', 'was', 'something', 'Hasidic', 'community', 'New', 'York', 'pre', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'grew', 'deepened', 'arrival', 'postwar', 'refugees', 'reality', 'was', 'entirely', 'movement', 'postwar', 'refugees', 'few', 'charismatic', 'rebbes', 'who', 'gathered', 'traumatized', 'survivors', 'helped', 'recreate', 'communities', 'side', 'ocean', 'size', 'fervor', 'communities', 'have', 'emerged', '60', 'years', 'testament', 'work', 'will', 'survive', 'individuals', 'people.I', 'found', 'Jack', 'Gold', 'patriarch', 'large', 'Hasidic', 'family', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'people', 'documentary', 'Orthodox', 'rather', 'Hasidic', 'Jew', 'wearing', 'kippah', 'hat', 'beard', 'side', 'curls', 'sons', 'grandsons', 'wear', 'appearance', 'as', 'much', 'testament', 'own', 'journey', 'concentration', 'camp', 'survivor', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'religion', 'someone', 'who', 'began', 'embrace', 'again', 'order', 'give', 'children', 'something', 'who', 'still', 'scars', 'own', 'life', 'one', 'sons', 'may', 'not', 'look', 'outside', 'Hasidic', 'heart.While', 'glimpses', 'various', 'ceremonies', 'festivals', 'were', 'fascinating', 'give', 'hint', 'level', 'joy', 'Hasidic', 'style', 'worship', 'lack', 'explanation', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'festival', 'was', 'being', 'celebrated', 'could', 'often', 'be', 'confusing', 'Footage', 'jumps', 'Sukkot', 'Purim', 'wedding', 'Shabbos', 'Chanukah', 'explanation', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'what', 'recommend', 'watching', 'documentary', 'once', 'then', 'directors', 'commentary', 'lot', 'understanding', 'scenes', 'should', ""n't"", 'undermine', 'accomplishment', 'having', 'scenes', 'rule', 'Hasidim', 'keep', 'do', 'not', 'interact', 'be', 'filmed', 'photographed', 'outsiders.But', 'even', 'commentary', 'was', 'often', 'left', 'more', 'questions', 'particularly', 'roles', 'women', 'relatively', 'few', 'glimpses', 'Hasidic', 'women', 'insights', 'lives', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'was', 'also', 'interested', 'hints', 'documentary', 'commentary', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'had', 'left', 'Hasid', 'community', 'had', 'one', 'female', 'representative', 'even', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'detail', 'could', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'entire', 'documentary', 'just', 'life', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'raised', 'less', 'religious', 'who', 'had', 'joined', 'Hasid', 'community', 'again', 'was', 'one', 'representative', 'was', 'particularly', 'curious', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'what', 'attraction', 'result', 'was', 'whole', 'good', 'introduction', 'joys', 'difficulties', 'tensions', 'way', 'life', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'curious']",Life Apart: Hasidism in America VHS
449230,A3Q04XXGGED746,6305120080,"Jan Peczkis ""Scholar and Thinker""","[5, 5]","The focus of this documentary is the Brooklyn Hasidic community. The sharp-eyed viewer can spot the twin towers of the World Trade center, rising above the apartments, in one of the scenes.The Hasidic movement began as a reaction against what some had considered the excessively rule-oriented and punitive view of God that characterized Orthodox Judaism. In Vilna (Wilno, Vilnius), the then-current rabbis denounced the new movement as a heresy, and its members were excommunicated. Yet Hasidism went on to become the dominant form of Judaism in eastern Europe. In the 19th century, some of its member turned away to substitute religions--Zionism, socialism, and Communism.For centuries, the Hassidim viewed America as a wild land that was amoral and materialistic. Many Hassidim who did come to America, having seen what they considered to be the sterility of conventional American Judaism, were ever more determined to retain their traditional way of life.The Hasidic movement stresses encounters with God in everyday life. Asceticism is rejected. The seeker of God should try to lose oneself in a mystic state. Gladness is the key to encountering God, while sadness is a barrier to the same. One Hasid is quoted as thinking of God having committed sins against the people even as he was repenting of his sins against God at Yom Kippur.The Hasidim believe in traditional family roles, and do not believe that anyone should take on a different role. Women dress modestly. Many Hasidic families are huge--sometimes with 10-14 children.",5,An Excellent Primer on Hasidic Judaism,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,1535,"['focus', 'documentary', 'Brooklyn', 'Hasidic', 'community', 'sharp-eyed', 'viewer', 'can', 'spot', 'twin', 'towers', 'World', 'Trade', 'center', 'rising', 'apartments', 'one', 'scenes.The', 'Hasidic', 'movement', 'began', 'reaction', 'what', 'had', 'considered', 'excessively', 'rule-oriented', 'punitive', 'view', 'God', 'characterized', 'Orthodox', 'Judaism', 'Vilna', 'Wilno', 'Vilnius', 'then-current', 'rabbis', 'denounced', 'new', 'movement', 'heresy', 'members', 'were', 'excommunicated', 'Hasidism', 'went', 'become', 'dominant', 'form', 'Judaism', 'eastern', 'Europe', '19th', 'century', 'member', 'turned', 'away', 'substitute', 'religions', 'Zionism', 'socialism', 'Communism.For', 'centuries', 'Hassidim', 'viewed', 'America', 'wild', 'land', 'was', 'amoral', 'materialistic', 'Many', 'Hassidim', 'who', 'did', 'come', 'America', 'having', 'seen', 'what', 'considered', 'be', 'sterility', 'conventional', 'American', 'Judaism', 'were', 'ever', 'more', 'determined', 'retain', 'traditional', 'way', 'life.The', 'Hasidic', 'movement', 'encounters', 'God', 'everyday', 'life', 'Asceticism', 'rejected', 'seeker', 'God', 'should', 'try', 'lose', 'mystic', 'state', 'Gladness', 'key', 'encountering', 'God', 'sadness', 'barrier', 'same', 'One', 'Hasid', 'quoted', 'thinking', 'God', 'having', 'committed', 'sins', 'people', 'even', 'was', 'repenting', 'sins', 'God', 'Yom', 'Kippur.The', 'Hasidim', 'believe', 'traditional', 'family', 'roles', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'anyone', 'should', 'take', 'different', 'role', 'Women', 'dress', 'modestly', 'Many', 'Hasidic', 'families', 'are', 'huge', 'sometimes', '10-14', 'children']",Life Apart: Hasidism in America VHS

Don't pass it up because you'll want to watch this one again and again. Why? Well, for one thing, it is 90 minutes of absolutely fascinating portraits of Hasidic Judaism, covering a range of values, views and lifestyles - more diversity than you might imagine in a group often seen as insular and restricted. For another, it isn't a one-sided film but one with with heart and integrity. It shows the harsh side as well as the beautiful side of the Hasidic world. There are interviews with people who resent Hasidic Jews or who think they're strange or ""weird"". But there are also rare and beautiful glimpes into the Hasidic lifestyle, mystical stories, lovely music. All in a context that makes clear that the Hasidim place a high value on family, community and, of course, spirituality.My only quibble is that they didn't show a non-Jewish woman who converted to Hasidic Judaism and I know there are plenty of those out there. Instead, one part focused on a woman who left the community. A little more balance would have been appreciated.

449233,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,6305120080,Kerry Walters,"[4, 4]","The adherents of all religions seek purity of one kind or another, but only a handful of nonmonastic religious communities believe that radical separation from the world is a necessary condition for it.  In the US, the Amish, the Hutterites, some of the more extreme fundamentalist Mormons, and the Hasidim are the religious groups which continue to live enclaved existences.  In ""A Life Apart,"" directors Menachem Daum and Oren Rudavsky explore the Hasidic community in NYC.Most Hasidim came to the US in the wake of the holocaust.  Four out of five European Hasidim were exterminated by the Nazis.  After the war, the five surviving heads of Hasidic communities brought their people to the US to begin anew--not in search of the great American dream, as the film makes clear, but in search of a safe place to survive as an intact religious tradition.  Accordingly, Hasidim keep to themselves, retaining their mode of worship, their distinctive garb, their community mores and norms.  Their marriages continue to be arranged, their families continue to be hierarchical and patriarchal, children are educated apart from the world (and thus have many professional avenues closed to them), homes continue to lack television and computers.  Goyim are shunned, as are non-Hasidic Jews.  There is, as one interviewed scholar observes, a voluntary forsaking of the rich pluralism of American culture for the sake of a spiritual purity that, while rich in certain ways, can also be in-bred, sultifying for some, and arrogantly judgmental of outsiders.  (But enclaves in America are hard to maintain, and more and more Hasidim are forced by economic straits to work outside of their community.  The segment in the film devoted to this migration wonderfully features a klezmer rendition of ""New York, New York"" as background music.)""A Life Apart"" does a good job of highlighting the benefits and disadvantages of Hasidic exclusivity, and in doing so helps viewers appreciate the challenges faced by all enclaved religious communities. But the film fails to convey adequately the incredible spiritual richness of the Hasidic tradition.  A few obligatory words are said about the Baal Shem Tov's focus on joy in religion, and his move away from legalistic and bookish Judaism.  But nothing is said about the specifics of his teachings nor of the Hasidic rebbes whom he inspired.  The upshot is that the film focuses on Hasidism primarily as a culture rather than a spiritual phenomenon.Leonard Nimoy and Sarah Jessica Parker narrate the film.  It's worth pointing out that Parker's annoyingly amateurish schoolgirl mode of delivery, as well as her public image from ""Sex and the City"" as a material girl, make her an odd and distracting choice.",4,The high cost of righteousness,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,2733,"['adherents', 'religions', 'seek', 'purity', 'one', 'kind', 'only', 'handful', 'nonmonastic', 'religious', 'communities', 'believe', 'radical', 'separation', 'world', 'necessary', 'condition', 'US', 'Amish', 'Hutterites', 'more', 'extreme', 'fundamentalist', 'Mormons', 'Hasidim', 'are', 'religious', 'groups', 'continue', 'live', 'enclaved', 'existences', 'A', 'Life', 'Apart', 'directors', 'Menachem', 'Daum', 'Oren', 'Rudavsky', 'explore', 'Hasidic', 'community', 'NYC.Most', 'Hasidim', 'came', 'US', 'wake', 'holocaust', 'Four', 'five', 'European', 'Hasidim', 'were', 'exterminated', 'Nazis', 'war', 'five', 'surviving', 'heads', 'Hasidic', 'communities', 'brought', 'people', 'US', 'begin', 'anew', 'not', 'search', 'great', 'American', 'dream', 'film', 'clear', 'search', 'safe', 'place', 'survive', 'intact', 'religious', 'tradition', 'Accordingly', 'Hasidim', 'keep', 'retaining', 'mode', 'worship', 'distinctive', 'garb', 'community', 'mores', 'norms', 'marriages', 'continue', 'be', 'arranged', 'families', 'continue', 'be', 'hierarchical', 'patriarchal', 'children', 'are', 'educated', 'apart', 'world', 'thus', 'have', 'many', 'professional', 'avenues', 'closed', 'homes', 'continue', 'lack', 'television', 'computers', 'Goyim', 'are', 'shunned', 'are', 'non-Hasidic', 'Jews', 'one', 'interviewed', 'scholar', 'observes', 'voluntary', 'forsaking', 'rich', 'pluralism', 'American', 'culture', 'sake', 'spiritual', 'purity', 'rich', 'certain', 'ways', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'in-bred', 'sultifying', 'arrogantly', 'judgmental', 'outsiders', 'America', 'are', 'hard', 'maintain', 'more', 'more', 'Hasidim', 'are', 'forced', 'economic', 'straits', 'work', 'community', 'segment', 'film', 'devoted', 'migration', 'wonderfully', 'klezmer', 'rendition', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'background', 'music', 'Life', 'Apart', 'good', 'job', 'highlighting', 'benefits', 'disadvantages', 'Hasidic', 'exclusivity', 'doing', 'so', 'helps', 'viewers', 'appreciate', 'challenges', 'faced', 'enclaved', 'religious', 'communities', 'film', 'convey', 'adequately', 'incredible', 'spiritual', 'richness', 'Hasidic', 'tradition', 'few', 'obligatory', 'words', 'are', 'said', 'Baal', 'Shem', 'Tov', 'focus', 'joy', 'religion', 'move', 'away', 'legalistic', 'bookish', 'Judaism', 'nothing', 'said', 'specifics', 'teachings', 'Hasidic', 'whom', 'inspired', 'upshot', 'film', 'Hasidism', 'primarily', 'culture', 'rather', 'spiritual', 'phenomenon.Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'narrate', 'film', 'worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'Parker', 'annoyingly', 'amateurish', 'schoolgirl', 'mode', 'delivery', 'as', 'well', 'public', 'image', 'Sex', 'City', 'material', 'girl', 'make', 'odd', 'distracting', 'choice']",Life Apart: Hasidism in America VHS
449234,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6305120080,Lawyeraau,"[90, 92]","This wonderful documentary by Oren Rudavsky and Menachem Daum, which is narrated by Leonard Nimoy and Sarah Jessica Parker, offers the viewer a birdseye view of an interesting, insular, and little known, yet often misunderstood, sect of Judaism. Founded in Eastern Europe in the eighteenth century, it is characterized by mysticism, prayer, and religious zeal. It is not a lifestyle for everyone, but it is certainly a lifestyle about which everyone should know.Hasidim  are singular in their way of living. The men wear the same type of clothing that was worn in Eastern Europe in the eighteenth century, hats, which often serve to distinguish one Hasidic sect from another, black pants, black jackets, and white shirts. The men are bearded and sport the traditional ""payess"", or side curls. The women cover their heads with scarves or elaborate wigs and are always modestly clothed, covered from head to toe. The Hasidim adhere to the same customs as when they were first founded, speak Yiddish, seem to have a universal, collective mind, for the most part, and adhere to a strict, ultra-orthodox interpretation of Judaism.The Hasidim came in large numbers to America sometime after World War II, peaking in the nineteen fifties. The narrators explain some of the reasons why the Hasidim, strangers in a strange land, were able to flourish. Many settled in New York City, and there are large communities of Hasidim in Brooklyn, where they try to co-exist with their non-Hasidim neighbors, not always successfully. They chiefly occupy the neighborhoods of Williamsburg, Crown Heights, and Boro Park. They even have their own town in upstste New York, Kiryas Joel. The documentary films the Hasidim in their downstate milieu and gives token recognition to how they are perceived by their non-Hasidim neighbors, who tend to view the self-imposed seclusion of the Hasidim as exclusion of themselves. To some extent they are correct, though not in the way one might think.While there are a number of sects, such as the Bobovs, the Satmars, the Lubavitchers, just to name of few of the most prominent here in America, each sect is ruled by its own Rebbe who is the acknowledged leader of the sect and highly revered. The film dwells upon the  commonalities, rather than differences, that exist among the various sects. Their differences, however, are a story for another documentary. This film focuses more on giving the viewer a somewhat loving view of the Hasidim, touching only briefly upon the differences between the Hasidim and the non-Hasidim.  Quite frankly, in some neighborhoods, there is a cold war going on between these two factions. One need only come to Brooklyn, New York to see this.The Hasidim tend to shun the media and do not watch films or television, for the most part. In fact, in watching the film, the viewer can see many Hasidim shielding themselves from the eye of the camera, so as not to appear. Some who did appear, however, expressed a justification for doing so. The Hasidim do not, as a whole, send their children to college to pursue a higher, secular education. The lack of higher education, however, precludes them from professional jobs such as lawyers, doctors, accountants, pharmacists, etc. They tend to work at jobs within their community where possible, though they will venture out into the larger non-Hasidic community for employment, when necessary. This is a source of concern for them and a test of their strength and resolve to adhere to their own ways, as such employment forces them to interact with a community with whom they normally would not.The film also takes the viewer into one of their schools or Yeshivas, allowing the viewer to see how the children are acculturated from early on. The Hasidim are essentially fundamentalists, and, as are many fundamentalists, they are extremely narrow in their world view. The film also interviews Paula Gluck, an obviously intelligent and articulate, young woman who left the Hasidic community to live her life as she chose, to write and seek a higher education among the non-Hasidim. The film balances this defection by interviewing a man who affirmatively chose to become Hasidim, though his Jewish parents, holocaust survivors, were not. It is an even handed handling of two issues germaine to the Hasidim, those who leave and those who join. The Hasidim are not part of mainstream America, nor do they wish to be, though they cherish many of the values cherished by other Americans: family, home, hearth, and community. Marriages, however, are arranged by the parents, often through a matchmaker. This documentary memorializes a Hasidic wedding and illustrates the division of the men from the women, even during such a joyous occasion.Whether one agrees or disagrees with their chosen way of life, however, this documentary is a most interesting film. Working in Brooklyn and finding myself often having to interact with the Hasidim, I absolutely loved this documentary, even though it was a bit of a white wash, leaving out some of the darker aspects of this segment of the Brooklyn community. One of the most important issues with respect to this community was entirely omitted. This was on the issue of their importance politically, as a group with which to be reckoned.  This group holds a great deal of political power, because they will follow their Rebbe's lead and vote as a block. Politicians in New York do not hesitate to curry favor with this group and court them because of it.  Most recently, the Hasidic community of Kiryas Joel in upstate New York made headlines for the way they voted in the race for U.S. Senator from New York and was the subject of much heated debate.Still, for those unfamiliar with the Hasidim, this documentary will be an interesting and delightful revelation and will hold the interest of the viewer throughout. The documentary is well done, beautifully filmed, and clearly, a labor of love. Those viewers who are interested in other cultures, ultra-orthodox Judaism, or the religious beliefs of others will have a deep appreciation for this wonderful and informative documentary.",5,OY

449235,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6305120080,Linda Linguvic,"[12, 16]","Seven years in the making, this 1997 documentary is about the elusive community of Hassidic Jews in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Founded in the 18th century in Poland, they preached a joy in living and kept their way of dress through the centuries, refusing to flee as the Holocaust approached, believing that God meant them to stay where they were.  As a result, more than 80% of them were killed, and many of the survivors emigrated to the United States in the early 1950s. A minority within a minority, they choose to live apart from secular America and think of themselves as something like the early pilgrims, who left their home country, not to assimilate, but to worship as they please.  New Yorkers have grown used to seeing the men in their long black outfits and side curls and the women in modest dresses and wigs.  Few have penetrated their community.  And many wonder about it.  But in this film, the filmmakers, who are Hasidic themselves, show a bit of this closed world.Narrated by Leonard Nimoy and Sarah Jessica Parker, we learn the history and get to meet some of the people.  We see the large and close-knit families, the early education, the rituals of the classroom.  All marriages are arranged and we meet a marriage broker and listen to a young man tell about his wedding.  We see the way the girls are educated to be wives and mothers although there are some women who speak out about the inequality of this, and we meet Pearl Gluck, a writer who has broken away from the community.  We also meet an African American man who raises questions about his Hasidic neighbors and their aloofness and inability to see his religion as important as their own.I found the video well done and quite interesting, with good choices of subjects and cinematography, especially in showing the faces of the children.  I know I learned a lot but I wanted to know more.  The film makes their lives seem idyllic.  Too much so.  But it's a good introduction to a way of life of a people who are sometimes shrouded in mystery.  And it certainly is a part of this grand mosaic that is America.

449238,A3QGRSZ7VTV0SY,6305120080,Rabbi Yonassan Gershom,"[60, 62]","This documentary is currently my #1 recommendation to students, teachers, and others who want a good visual presentation of Hasidic culture. I highly recommend it in my well-used Hasidism FAQ, and it is the #1 best-selling educational video on my website. Whether you are teaching a unit on &quot;The Chosen&quot; in some remote area where there are no Hasidism, or living in New York City where you see Hasidim every day on the streets and have always wondered about them, this video is for you. It's an excelent multi-cultural tool and, because of its PBS documentary style, it can be used in public schools without violating the separation of church (synagogue, actually...) and state.My one complaint is that the producers fell for the ubiquitous &quot;obligatory&quot; politically-correct need to include a dissatified woman (poet Pearl Gluck) who left the Hasidic community.  I realize that PBS wants to be objective, but why not balance this with a story about a &quot;modern&quot; woman who left that world to become Hasidic (of which there are MANY!!!)I also felt that the segment about the black guy who was offended when he asked about a Jewish holy day and was told &quot;we are praying for you, too&quot; was not well explained.  The black guy thought the Jew was being paternalistic toward blacks by praying for &quot;the poor black guy&quot; (his assumption)  but that was not it at all. Since the Jewish group was gathered around the water saying prayers, I assume it was Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) and they were doing the tashlich service.  The THEME of Rosh Hashanah includes prayers for the whole world --it has nothing to do with race.  It would have been nice if ths had been explained somehow.Still, this is the best documentary on Hasidism currently available on video and, in spite of these flaws, it is well worth buying as an educational resource. (I currently recommend it on my Hasidism FAQ site).

449241,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,6305120080,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[21, 33]","With Manis Friedman and Shmuely Boteach popularizing the philosophy and beliefs of Orthodox Judaism, particulary the Chasidic branch of Lubavitch from which they both began (although Rabbi Boteach parted ways with Chabad over a decade ago) the world of the Hasidim is larger than ever before. Of course, the Lubavitch branch of Hasidim is merely the most popular and ""evangelistic"" (using that term loosely since they only reach out to Jews and they are much less eager to tell non-observant Jews what's good about them than what's wrong.) but there are several branches and most are based in NYC. Many filmmakers have recently used the Hasidic lifestyle in their movies - Price above Rubies, Kadosh, Stranger Among Us, The Chosen - and interest continues.Unfortunately this video is merely window dressing. There are some good stories, some vignettes, plenty of shots of the neighborhoods (which are hard to get if the director of THe Believer is right) but a lot of it is reinforcement of the romanticized image vs. the distaste that non-observant Jews have with Chasidic Jews. It shows the female ""rabbi"" complaining that the Chasidic Jews didn't want her talking to their son because she was dressed immodestly. It has the formerly Chasidic woman talking about her life outside the community and her continued affection for it. It shows the professors painting the communities with broad strokes (don't go to college, only gets married, doesn't take jobs that require advanced degrees, stay poor, etc.) ignoring the exceptions like the Lubavitchers going to college or the diamond businesses. Most of it rings true. Some rings rather false - especially the non-Chasidim passing judgment on the Chasidic - as with the Macalaster professor smugly stating that if men are distracted by women's voices why would G-d want to use them (the flip side of that argument is why would G-d create men that are so uptight that they can't feel a stirring at a woman's singing voice)The narration is amusing just because Leonard Nimoy is in full ""In Search of..."" voice as if he's talking about some strange tribe that eats bugs while piercing their noses and not his own relatives. Sarah Jessica Parker's narration is so entwined with Sex and The City that you expect her to say ""Do Frum Jews have sex? Do they enjoy it?""It's a nice video. A good introduction to the world of Chasidim. There's nothing too deep about it. YOu aren't going to hear about the Yeshiva drug scenes or the ways in which Chasidic Jews embrace and pull away from the communities. They don't even mention WHY the Gaon of Vilna excommunicated the Chasidic movement which has a lot more to do with Shabbtei Zvi's lunacy of a generation before and a lot less to do with any dogma on his part. Nor is the movie going to even mention that the Modern Orthodox students playing hockey are just as frum as the Bobov Rabbi that's teaching them - just in different ways.The movie ends with the wedding of the great granddaughter of the Bobov Rebbe and the subtitles read that he was the last rebbe to bring his community over from teh Holocaust. The sheer number of people celebrating that wedding is astounding but that's the main point of the movie - Chasidic Jews are nuts but they keep Judaism alive. Like Sholem Aleichem it seeks to romanticize a people that it doesn't want to join, rather than the works of I.B. Singer which engages them like real flesh-and-blood people. However, it does an excellent job of presenting a general overview - even if it's superficial.",3,In Search of...Jews,1062288000,"08 31, 2003",2003,3527,"['Manis', 'Friedman', 'Shmuely', 'Boteach', 'popularizing', 'philosophy', 'beliefs', 'Orthodox', 'Judaism', 'particulary', 'Chasidic', 'branch', 'Lubavitch', 'began', 'Rabbi', 'Boteach', 'parted', 'ways', 'Chabad', 'decade', 'ago', 'world', 'Hasidim', 'larger', 'ever', 'course', 'Lubavitch', 'branch', 'Hasidim', 'merely', 'most', 'popular', 'evangelistic', 'using', 'term', 'loosely', 'only', 'reach', 'out', 'Jews', 'are', 'much', 'less', 'eager', 'tell', 'non-observant', 'Jews', 'what', 'good', 'what', 'wrong', 'are', 'several', 'branches', 'most', 'are', 'based', 'NYC', 'Many', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'recently', 'used', 'Hasidic', 'lifestyle', 'movies', 'Price', 'Rubies', 'Kadosh', 'Stranger', 'Us', 'Chosen', 'interest', 'continues.Unfortunately', 'video', 'merely', 'window', 'dressing', 'are', 'good', 'stories', 'vignettes', 'plenty', 'shots', 'neighborhoods', 'are', 'hard', 'get', 'director', 'THe', 'Believer', 'right', 'lot', 'reinforcement', 'romanticized', 'image', 'vs.', 'distaste', 'non-observant', 'Jews', 'have', 'Chasidic', 'Jews', 'female', 'rabbi', 'complaining', 'Chasidic', 'Jews', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'talking', 'son', 'was', 'dressed', 'immodestly', 'formerly', 'Chasidic', 'woman', 'talking', 'life', 'community', 'continued', 'affection', 'professors', 'painting', 'communities', 'broad', 'strokes', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'college', 'only', 'married', ""n't"", 'take', 'jobs', 'require', 'advanced', 'degrees', 'stay', 'poor', 'etc', 'ignoring', 'exceptions', 'Lubavitchers', 'going', 'college', 'diamond', 'businesses', 'Most', 'true', 'rings', 'rather', 'false', 'especially', 'non-Chasidim', 'passing', 'judgment', 'Chasidic', 'Macalaster', 'professor', 'smugly', 'stating', 'men', 'are', 'distracted', 'women', 'voices', 'why', 'would', 'G-d', 'want', 'use', 'flip', 'side', 'argument', 'why', 'would', 'G-d', 'create', 'men', 'are', 'so', 'uptight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'stirring', 'woman', 'singing', 'voice', 'narration', 'amusing', 'just', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'full', 'Search', 'voice', 'talking', 'strange', 'tribe', 'bugs', 'piercing', 'noses', 'not', 'own', 'relatives', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'narration', 'so', 'entwined', 'Sex', 'City', 'expect', 'say', 'Do', 'Frum', 'Jews', 'have', 'sex', 'Do', 'enjoy', 'nice', 'video', 'good', 'introduction', 'world', 'Chasidim', 'nothing', 'too', 'deep', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'hear', 'Yeshiva', 'drug', 'scenes', 'ways', 'Chasidic', 'Jews', 'embrace', 'pull', 'away', 'communities', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'Gaon', 'Vilna', 'excommunicated', 'Chasidic', 'movement', 'lot', 'more', 'do', 'Shabbtei', 'Zvi', 'lunacy', 'generation', 'lot', 'less', 'do', 'dogma', 'part', 'movie', 'going', 'even', 'mention', 'Modern', 'Orthodox', 'students', 'playing', 'hockey', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'frum', 'Bobov', 'Rabbi', 'teaching', 'just', 'different', 'ways.The', 'movie', 'wedding', 'great', 'granddaughter', 'Bobov', 'Rebbe', 'subtitles', 'read', 'was', 'last', 'rebbe', 'bring', 'community', 'teh', 'Holocaust', 'sheer', 'number', 'people', 'celebrating', 'wedding', 'astounding', 'main', 'point', 'movie', 'Chasidic', 'Jews', 'are', 'nuts', 'keep', 'Judaism', 'alive', 'Sholem', 'Aleichem', 'romanticize', 'people', ""n't"", 'want', 'join', 'rather', 'works', 'I.B', 'Singer', 'real', 'flesh-and-blood', 'people', 'However', 'excellent', 'job', 'presenting', 'general', 'overview', 'even', 'superficial']",Life Apart: Hasidism in America VHS
