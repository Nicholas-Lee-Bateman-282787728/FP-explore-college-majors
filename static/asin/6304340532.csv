415336,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6304340532,Austin Somlo,"[2, 19]","Viewed: 4/06Rate: 14/06: Why did Curly Sue have to be made? What an awful film. If Curly Sue was any more annoying, I would have proclaimed it one of the truly worst pictures made. Sadly, I don't think it belongs in that class but enough to be part of the worst of the worst. Basically, I hated everything about this picture. Not even one second did I laugh during the film. The acting is not too bad on James Belushi and Kelly McGillis's parts. The rest is just plain drivel, aiming to allow the girl's presence be the highlight of the film, which fails miserably. Another failure is the story itself, which is widely implausible for me to believe. No hotshot female lawyer would risk her life in taking care of two ""derelicts."" Even if there was a car accident, the prudent thing to do is to check the damage of the car, have the man treated at the hospital to prevent further brain injury, and file a police report out since it was an accident. In the end, Curly Sue is about a woman who gets taken advantage of a father and a daughter, which caused her to give up everything she worked for.

Farmbrough ""Dave Farmbrough""","[0, 3]","This is John Hughes's last film (to date) as a director and marks a change in focus from his previous work where he had focussed more on teenagers than small children. The expert view of teenage life given in Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club gives way to a rather Hollywood view of cutesy tots. Stage school moppet Alisan Porter is only a short step away from singing 'Tomorrow, Tomorrow' or 'Animal Crackers In My Soup' and both the performance and writing jar somewhat in an otherwise well-made film. Belushi is an amiable anti-hero as the tramp that gets helped out by the mega-rich lawyer, but Kelly Lynch's character is somewhat clich&eacute;d. Do lawyers really get paid as much in America as film and television would have you believe? If so, no wonder people dislike them so much.

415372,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,6304340532,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[17, 17]","""Curly Sue"" has the kind of premise that, usually, end up being only partially realized in movies.  They end up good, but with a feeling that they could have been a lot better.  In ""Curly Sue"", the title little girl and her father are homeless people who get by through pulling low-scale little scams - when the dad pretends to, say, be hit by a very expensive-looking car and mildly hurt, the two of them can often end up receiving a sympathy meal at a nice restaurant and perhaps even a place to stay for the night.  (It sounds depressing, but it isn't - it skirts the path of being too downcast for a family movie without trivializing the issues it's depicting)  After one incident, the woman Curly's dad Bill pretends to be injured by ends up taking them into her home; and despite her being engaged (to an approriately unlikable boor), the woman (named Grey) and Bill begin to have feelings for one another, even as Grey finds herself becoming quickly attached to Curly Sue.At your local video store, you'll most likely find this one in the Family Movie section, where it'll easily be amongst the cream of the crop in those aisles.  But it's also an uproarious comedy that outshines ninety per cent of the titles in the comedy section, and more genuinely moving and dramatic than most movies on the Drama shelves.  ""Curly Sue"" hits every note it plays to perfection, has smashing performances (including James Belushi in his best role as Bill, Kelly Lynch as Grey, and Allison Porter unforgettable as the dynamic pint-sized fireball of a title character), and doesn't at all end up in the class of movies that are ""good, but really should have been better"" - it's the opposite, going well above even the high end of the potential one would think it has.

Their scams are aimed not at turning a profit, but at getting enough to eat.

But Grey is touched, and over the objections of her snotty fiance, insist on putting the two up for the night. As they get to know each other, Bill becomes convinced that this is where Curly Sue belongs - in a home, cared for by someone that can give her the advantages that his homeless, nomadic existence lacks.
