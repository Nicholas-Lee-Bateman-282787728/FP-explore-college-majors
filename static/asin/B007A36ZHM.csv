1528861,A2UITTZE0YDER2,B007A36ZHM,"ServusDei ""udayajmj""","[45, 50]","God's mighty servant is a very comprehensive biopic of the Sister Pascalina Lehnert, who served as Pope Pius XII's secretary and house keeper from 1917 to 1958. This film/ mini-series has tried to remain faithful to her life showing her humble origins as a farmer's daughter in Bavaria to being the confidant of the Pope. In this film we see a woman of great character and determination, and sanctity who loved to serve and did so perfectly, with that same efficiency that make Germans proud! However, she was also a woman of steel, who would not submit to any feigned or pretentious actions either by her subordinates of her superiors. One would get a sense of stubbornness, that would appear to be little more that pride, however it is not pride but a prayerful woman convinced of a calling to serve and serve she did. And if she had to weather a storm of controversy, she would face it head on! Despite these incidences, Sister Pascalina emerges strong and is not only a friend to the Pope, but  a sister and mother as well. And the fondness and mutual respect that they had for each other is beautifully depicted.Our present Holy Father, before becoming Pontiff, apparently jokingly called Mother Pascalina ""The most powerful Bavarian in Vatican history'. Pope Benedict XVI continued, ""..........as housekeeper and secretary Madre Pascalina managed to create the human living space for Pius XII, which he needed, to fulfil his duties in a difficult time"".*How did Sister Pascalina get to be where she was? How was she perceived by her superiors, fellow religious and the general public as a whole? What made her determined to be the servant of Cardinal Pacelli, who would later become Pope? What was the driving force behind her? How was she of assistance to this great pontiff during WWII? All these questions and many more are beautifully answered and well acted out in this film.The movie claims to be based on real events.One of the great lessons that this film teaches is that saintly people need not be doormats. Would it be presumptious of me to call her a saint? Perhaps....however Pope Pius XII was a saintly pontiff and I'm sure he would have directed his friend and secretary towards the Kingdom.The part of the sister played by  Christine Neubauer is excellent. She looks like the real Sister Pascalina and truly brings out her character. The other members of the cast did no less a job.The movie does drag a little, however at the end it is worth watching it for there is so little known about Sister Pascalina.This film is not a tearjerker. The practical approach of the character of Sr.Pascalina, the common sense she exudes, her moments of impatience, short-tempers and her devotion to the Pope gives no room for tears......or at least that's my humble opinion.This film is in German with English subtitles. The running time is 200 minutes.Unlike other releases of biopics on the Saints from Ignatius press, this does not come with a booklet and there are no special features.A remarkable film on a remarkable woman in remarkable times!*source:wikipedia",5,Speak Lord...for Thy servant heareth!,1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,3073,"['God', 'mighty', 'servant', 'very', 'comprehensive', 'biopic', 'Sister', 'Pascalina', 'Lehnert', 'who', 'served', 'Pope', 'Pius', 'XII', 'secretary', 'house', 'keeper', '1917', '1958', 'film/', 'mini-series', 'tried', 'remain', 'faithful', 'life', 'showing', 'humble', 'origins', 'farmer', 'daughter', 'Bavaria', 'being', 'confidant', 'Pope', 'film', 'see', 'woman', 'great', 'character', 'determination', 'sanctity', 'who', 'loved', 'serve', 'did', 'so', 'perfectly', 'same', 'efficiency', 'make', 'Germans', 'proud', 'However', 'was', 'also', 'woman', 'steel', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'submit', 'feigned', 'pretentious', 'actions', 'subordinates', 'superiors', 'One', 'would', 'get', 'sense', 'stubbornness', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'pride', 'however', 'not', 'pride', 'prayerful', 'woman', 'convinced', 'calling', 'serve', 'serve', 'did', 'had', 'weather', 'storm', 'controversy', 'would', 'face', 'head', 'incidences', 'Sister', 'Pascalina', 'strong', 'not', 'only', 'friend', 'Pope', 'sister', 'mother', 'as', 'well', 'fondness', 'mutual', 'respect', 'had', 'other', 'beautifully', 'depicted.Our', 'present', 'Holy', 'Father', 'becoming', 'Pontiff', 'apparently', 'jokingly', 'called', 'Mother', 'Pascalina', 'most', 'powerful', 'Bavarian', 'Vatican', 'history', 'Pope', 'Benedict', 'XVI', 'continued', 'housekeeper', 'secretary', 'Madre', 'Pascalina', 'managed', 'create', 'human', 'living', 'space', 'Pius', 'XII', 'needed', 'fulfil', 'duties', 'difficult', 'time', '*How', 'did', 'Sister', 'Pascalina', 'get', 'be', 'where', 'was', 'How', 'was', 'perceived', 'superiors', 'fellow', 'religious', 'general', 'public', 'whole', 'What', 'made', 'determined', 'be', 'servant', 'Cardinal', 'Pacelli', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'Pope', 'What', 'was', 'driving', 'force', 'How', 'was', 'assistance', 'great', 'pontiff', 'WWII', 'questions', 'many', 'more', 'are', 'beautifully', 'answered', 'well', 'acted', 'out', 'film.The', 'movie', 'claims', 'be', 'based', 'real', 'events.One', 'great', 'lessons', 'film', 'saintly', 'people', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'doormats', 'Would', 'be', 'presumptious', 'call', 'saint', 'Perhaps', '.however', 'Pope', 'Pius', 'XII', 'was', 'saintly', 'pontiff', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'directed', 'friend', 'secretary', 'towards', 'Kingdom.The', 'part', 'sister', 'played', 'Christine', 'Neubauer', 'excellent', 'real', 'Sister', 'Pascalina', 'truly', 'out', 'character', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'did', 'less', 'job.The', 'movie', 'drag', 'little', 'however', 'end', 'worth', 'watching', 'so', 'little', 'known', 'Sister', 'Pascalina.This', 'film', 'not', 'tearjerker', 'practical', 'approach', 'character', 'Sr.Pascalina', 'common', 'sense', 'moments', 'impatience', 'short-tempers', 'devotion', 'Pope', 'room', 'tears', 'least', 'humble', 'opinion.This', 'film', 'German', 'English', 'subtitles', 'running', 'time', '200', 'minutes.Unlike', 'other', 'releases', 'biopics', 'Saints', 'Ignatius', 'press', 'not', 'come', 'booklet', 'are', 'special', 'features.A', 'remarkable', 'film', 'remarkable', 'woman', 'remarkable', 'times', '*source', 'wikipedia']","God's Mighty Servant: Sister Pascalina Lehnert, Secretary of Pius XII"

Begining in1912 and ending in 1958,this two part German miniseries covers much of the tumolt in Germanywhen it was under threat from both the Communists and the NationalSocialists. The Communist takeover of Bavaria and the later Beer HallPutcsh are shown as well as both evil ideologies hatred ofChristianity. Through it all, Pacelli, with the unprecedentedassistance of Sister Pascalina, attempts to protect Catholics inGermany from religious intolerance.Later when Hitler comes to power, the Nazis begin their assault onCatholicism in Germany using the same tactics and arguments that theObama administration and the Democrat Party are doing today in theUnited States. Pacelli eventually becomes Secretary of State at theVatican with Sister Pascalina, again without precedent in Churchhistory, installing herself as one of his aides.Finally Pacelli becomes Pius Xll, Germany and Russia invade Poland,World War 2 in Europe erupts and the Holocaust begins. Puis isconfronted with the problem of what can someone do who, as Stalin soinfamously observed, has no divisions. Opting for silence, the Pope,with the assistance of Sister Pascalina, manages to save thousands ofJews---more than any other head of state at the time during the War.A superb and original historical film covering much World War 2history not filmed before as well as German and obviously Catholichistory. There is much here that the viewer will be unfamiliar with.For example, one was unaware of the seething hostility that the UnitedStates had towards Catholics in the 1930s. The acting, direction andscript are elegant and intelligent reminding one of the historicalfilms made in the 1950s and 60s. The film is enlighting, informativeand amazingly, considering its heavy and dry subject matters,entertaining.Interesting enough, with the miniseries on Paul Xl and then John Paulll(with Jon Voight and Christopher Lee), we now have a superb trilogycovering much of 20th century Catholic history.Recommended.",4,A superb and original historical miniseries,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,2334,"['GOD', 'MIGHTY', 'SERVANT', 'SISTER', 'PASCALINA', 'LEHNERT', 'SECRETARY', 'OF', 'PIUS', 'XII', '2012', 'Directed', 'Markus', 'Rosenmuller.Starring', 'Christine', 'Neubauer', 'Sister', 'Pascalina', 'Lehnert', 'RemoGirone', 'Pope', 'Pius', 'XII.The', 'duel', 'biography', 'Sister', 'Pascalina', 'Lehnert', 'German', 'nun', 'attach', 'Eugenio', 'Pacelli', 'man', 'who', 'willeventually', 'become', 'Pope', 'Puis', 'Xll', 'Begining', 'in1912', 'ending', '1958', 'two', 'part', 'German', 'covers', 'much', 'tumolt', 'Germanywhen', 'was', 'threat', 'Communists', 'NationalSocialists', 'Communist', 'takeover', 'Bavaria', 'later', 'Beer', 'HallPutcsh', 'are', 'shown', 'as', 'well', 'evil', 'ideologies', 'hatred', 'ofChristianity', 'Pacelli', 'unprecedentedassistance', 'Sister', 'Pascalina', 'protect', 'Catholics', 'inGermany', 'religious', 'intolerance.Later', 'when', 'Hitler', 'power', 'Nazis', 'begin', 'assault', 'onCatholicism', 'Germany', 'using', 'same', 'tactics', 'arguments', 'theObama', 'administration', 'Democrat', 'Party', 'are', 'doing', 'today', 'theUnited', 'States', 'Pacelli', 'eventually', 'Secretary', 'State', 'theVatican', 'Sister', 'Pascalina', 'again', 'precedent', 'Churchhistory', 'installing', 'one', 'aides.Finally', 'Pacelli', 'Pius', 'Xll', 'Germany', 'Russia', 'invade', 'Poland', 'World', 'War', '2', 'Europe', 'erupts', 'Holocaust', 'begins', 'Puis', 'isconfronted', 'problem', 'what', 'can', 'someone', 'do', 'who', 'Stalin', 'soinfamously', 'observed', 'divisions', 'Opting', 'silence', 'Pope', 'assistance', 'Sister', 'Pascalina', 'save', 'thousands', 'ofJews', '-more', 'other', 'head', 'state', 'time', 'War.A', 'superb', 'original', 'historical', 'film', 'covering', 'much', 'World', 'War', '2history', 'not', 'filmed', 'as', 'well', 'German', 'obviously', 'Catholichistory', 'much', 'here', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'unfamiliar', 'with.For', 'example', 'one', 'was', 'unaware', 'seething', 'hostility', 'UnitedStates', 'had', 'towards', 'Catholics', '1930s', 'acting', 'direction', 'andscript', 'are', 'elegant', 'intelligent', 'reminding', 'one', 'historicalfilms', 'made', '1950s', '60s', 'film', 'enlighting', 'informativeand', 'amazingly', 'considering', 'heavy', 'dry', 'subject', 'matters', 'entertaining.Interesting', 'enough', 'miniseries', 'Paul', 'Xl', 'then', 'John', 'Paulll', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'now', 'have', 'superb', 'trilogycovering', 'much', '20th', 'century', 'Catholic', 'history.Recommended']","God's Mighty Servant: Sister Pascalina Lehnert, Secretary of Pius XII"
