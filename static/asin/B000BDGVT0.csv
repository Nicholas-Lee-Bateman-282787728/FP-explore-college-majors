Beloved by many, the saint is framed in a film that captures beauty fitting for ""The Little Flower"".  There are many heartwarming moments throughout to nourish the soul.  Containing some elements of her autobiography, `A Story of a Soul,' but narrating less than the previous film from 1986, this `Therese' reinacts key scenes of her life more fully.  Wisely, the treatment is only occasionally langorous, and  is mostly well edited.  To accommodate a modern audience, they seldom dwell on any one scene too long.  The acting won't win prizes in the history of Catholic cinema, but with a few wooden moments, they wisely try not to over dramatize her story, even when exceptional developments come to ordinary lives.  There are even some surprising special effects in places that work well, especially without a blockbuster budget.  Nevertheless, with the drama accentuated by Sr. Marie Therese Sokol`s, OCD, beautiful score, they are playing for an old-fashioned movie appeal.  Directed by Leonardo Defilippis, whose performance as her father, Martin, is the best in the show, and the screenplay written by his wife, Patti, 'The'r'ese is an admirable effort.  The comraderie between the sisters is captured well enough, and progressively, the dramatic tension grows somewhat.  There are some cutesy scenes as well that almost reminded me of films like `The Trouble with Angels,' but it is hard to imagine a film about The'r'ese that could do without it.Overall, `The'r'ese' is a good film about a Catholic saint that should be considered for mainstream consumption.  Whereas 1986's `The'r'ese' makes a good one-woman impersonation, like a stand-up narrative, this `The'r'ese' at least has the drama that was begging to be made.",3,Movie of a Soul,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,1778,"[""r'ese"", 'embellishes', 'well', 'subject', 'matter', 'Beloved', 'many', 'saint', 'framed', 'film', 'beauty', 'fitting', 'Little', 'Flower', 'are', 'many', 'heartwarming', 'moments', 'nourish', 'soul', 'Containing', 'elements', 'autobiography', 'Story', 'Soul', 'narrating', 'less', 'previous', 'film', '1986', 'Therese', 'reinacts', 'key', 'scenes', 'life', 'more', 'fully', 'Wisely', 'treatment', 'only', 'occasionally', 'langorous', 'mostly', 'well', 'edited', 'accommodate', 'modern', 'audience', 'seldom', 'dwell', 'one', 'scene', 'too', 'long', 'acting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'prizes', 'history', 'Catholic', 'cinema', 'few', 'wooden', 'moments', 'wisely', 'try', 'not', 'dramatize', 'story', 'even', 'when', 'exceptional', 'developments', 'come', 'ordinary', 'lives', 'are', 'even', 'surprising', 'special', 'effects', 'places', 'work', 'well', 'especially', 'blockbuster', 'budget', 'Nevertheless', 'drama', 'accentuated', 'Sr.', 'Marie', 'Therese', 'Sokol', 's', 'OCD', 'beautiful', 'score', 'are', 'playing', 'old-fashioned', 'movie', 'appeal', 'Directed', 'Leonardo', 'Defilippis', 'performance', 'father', 'Martin', 'best', 'show', 'screenplay', 'written', 'wife', 'Patti', ""'The"", ""r'ese"", 'admirable', 'effort', 'comraderie', 'sisters', 'captured', 'well', 'enough', 'progressively', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'somewhat', 'are', 'cutesy', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'almost', 'reminded', 'films', 'Trouble', 'Angels', 'hard', 'imagine', 'film', ""r'ese"", 'could', 'do', 'it.Overall', ""r'ese"", 'good', 'film', 'Catholic', 'saint', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'mainstream', 'consumption', '1986', ""r'ese"", 'good', 'one-woman', 'impersonation', 'stand-up', 'narrative', ""r'ese"", 'least', 'drama', 'was', 'begging', 'be', 'made']",Therese

While Mr.DeFilippis is to be commended for trying to bring the Little Flower blossoming onto mainstream screens,his film is a disappointment.There are high points to the movie-it has beautiful cinematography,lovely period costumes,the settings in Oregon turned out to be a good double for Normandy.Leonardo's performance as the Little Flower's father is powerful and touching,proof that he is a talented actor.Sadly,this movie moves too quickly,and reduces the Little Flower's life to Hallmark-type vignettes.When the Little Flower is conflicted about her final vows,everything is resolved in a quick conversation with the Mother Superior,and all is well. The scene in which the Little Flower takes the veil moved me nearly to tears,but instead of making the ceremony into a teachable moment,it lasts only five minutes.The Little Flower's arguments with an older,grouchy nun are pious sitcom material.When Therese goes to school,it's basically a Gallic version of ""Anne of Green Gables.""  Therese's nearly constant,sappy voice-over isn't helpful.""Therese"",despite its Vatican endorsement,is a disappointment.While it's beautiful as a film,it lacks substance and weight.It doesn't do justice to the Little Flower's depth of suffering and spirituality.",2,The Great Disappointment,1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,1616,"['When', 'Leonardo', 'DeFilippis', 'made', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'general', 'public', 'rather', 'just', 'St.Luke', 'Productions', 'chose', 'challenging', 'saint', 'contemplative', 'St.Therese', 'Lisieux.He', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'warrior', 'maiden', 'St.Joan', 'Arc', 'Bl.Miguel', 'Pro', 'who', 'had', 'conceal', 'identity', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'martyrdom', 'Mexico', 'crying', 'Viva', 'Cristo', 'Rey', 'Mr.DeFilippis', 'be', 'commended', 'trying', 'bring', 'Little', 'Flower', 'blossoming', 'mainstream', 'screens', 'film', 'disappointment.There', 'are', 'high', 'points', 'movie-it', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'lovely', 'period', 'costumes', 'settings', 'Oregon', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'double', 'Normandy.Leonardo', 'performance', 'Little', 'Flower', 'father', 'powerful', 'touching', 'proof', 'talented', 'actor.Sadly', 'movie', 'too', 'quickly', 'Little', 'Flower', 'life', 'Hallmark-type', 'Little', 'Flower', 'conflicted', 'final', 'vows', 'everything', 'resolved', 'quick', 'conversation', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'well', 'scene', 'Little', 'Flower', 'veil', 'moved', 'nearly', 'tears', 'instead', 'making', 'ceremony', 'teachable', 'moment', 'only', 'five', 'minutes.The', 'Little', 'Flower', 'arguments', 'older', 'grouchy', 'nun', 'are', 'pious', 'sitcom', 'material.When', 'Therese', 'school', 'basically', 'Gallic', 'version', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Therese', 'nearly', 'constant', 'sappy', 'voice-over', ""n't"", 'helpful', 'Therese', 'Vatican', 'endorsement', 'disappointment.While', 'beautiful', 'film', 'substance', 'weight.It', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'Little', 'Flower', 'depth', 'suffering', 'spirituality']",Therese

While I recognize that the Church has no shortage of internal enemies, since and as a result of Vatican II, I disagree with those who theorize that the film was produced by wolves in sheep's clothing.  I believe, rather, that the people involved had their hearts in the right place.  And, indeed, the film is anything but execrable.  It is, however, superficial, inept, and misses the mark completely.  Therese of Lisieux is an extraordinary saint, as well as a Doctor of the Church.  Both she and the faithful deserve considerably more than this movie offers.In addition to the film just not capturing the essence and importance of St. Therese, the acting left a great deal to be desired.  The young actresses (Lindsay Younce in particular) have charm and are appropriately, if somewhat awkwardly, earnest.  Still, the amateurishness is palpable; I had the impression that I was watching a high school production put on by reasonably talented seniors.There was one scene that I found jarring.  When the young nuns put on a play, they shed their habits for costumes.  Fair enough.  But they all have long hair.  It should have been made clear that they were wearing wigs; a young lady's hair is cut short once she enters a religious order.  This was true in St. Therese's time.  It remains true in our own, assuming that we're referencing a traditional community, such as the Carmelites of Colorado Springs, and not a post-conciliar one (dying out, thank God) where the women dress like 1950s prison matrons.Still, the movie is wholesome, and I reservedly recommend it.FYI:  According to the traditional calendar (I pay no attention to the ""reformed"" one), St. Therese's feast day is October 3.

I do not claim to know a lot now ... but, through this film, I have been intrigued enough to want to learn more.There are those who say that it is impossible to condense ""The Story of a Soul"" into a movie.  This is very true.  But, let's think about that statement for a moment.  Is it even possible to condense a life into a book?  To have the WHOLE story one would have to write every day's activities (the entire day) into a journal.  The book would be at least 365 pages long for every year of a person's life.  I say even ""The Story of a Soul"" cannot (technically) cover all of St. Therese's beautiful life.That being said, why not start with a brief introduction?  Of course, the movie is never as detailed or as intimate as the book, the book is never as detailed or as intamate as the life!If you are the type of person who studies your faith, yet you have areas other than St. Therese you prefer to study at this time, why not a brief introduction through this movie?  It is great for the whole family.  Regardless of what anyone says this movie makes you stop and think.Some inacturate reviews state the cinematography is lousy and the acting worse.  Because of these ""ugly"" reviews I expected my DVD of Therese to be cheap movie making. I was shocked that anyone could say such ugly things about a movie that was so beautifully shot.

Sthilaire ""Memere Jackie""","[3, 7]","The film Therese with director Leonardo DeFilippis' commentaries more than met my expectations.Having read all of Therese's works I was prepared for a more somber look at Therese's life but was pleasantly surprised to have her life depicted as a normal girl, brought up in a very affluent lifestyle.Many of our modern day saints have been raised from poverty to sainthood.  Therese on the other hand was given everything a young girl would need and wanted.  And yet, something, someone was still missing in her soul.The journey of a soul is Therese's journey as well as our own and this film gives us a glimpse of the struggles and ectasies that one will encounter once a person begins to search for more outside oneself.The film Therese does the journey justice and toward the end of this young girl's life all is not abandoned as Therese struggles to see God's love working in her soul.  She defies death by announcing the great love of God beyond her pain.Other books for the journey for your consideration with my reviews:Who Told You That You Were Naked: Freedom From Judgement, Guilt and Fear of PunishmentAcceptance of self leads to love of self, God & others.Experiencing the Depths of Jesus Christ (Library of Spiritual Classics, Volume 2)Jesus is the way and the truth.Radical Optimism: Rooting Ourselves in RealityA deep and luminous vision.Pursuit of GodGaze into the heart of GodLiving in the Presence of God: The Everyday Spirituality of Brother Lawrence (30 Days With a Great Spiritual Teacher)Be close to the heart of God.The Dialogue of St. Catherine of SienaCatherine's dialogues with God the Father.God, Dreams, and Revelation; A Christian Interpretation of DreamsDreams are gifts from God.No Man Is an IslandWithout solitude there can be no communion.Through Seasons of the HeartPlease be patient; God is not finished with me yet.God CallingLo, I am with you always.Grace in Every Season: Through the Year With Catherine Doherty/Daily ReflectionsGrace in Every Season: Through the Year With Catherine De Hueck Doherty  A daily dose of Catherine's spirituality,SadhanaSadhana  Listen with your heart.",5,Simplicity is the key to God's inner life.,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,2119,"['film', 'Therese', 'director', 'Leonardo', 'DeFilippis', 'commentaries', 'more', 'met', 'expectations.Having', 'read', 'Therese', 'works', 'was', 'prepared', 'more', 'somber', 'look', 'Therese', 'life', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'have', 'life', 'depicted', 'normal', 'girl', 'brought', 'up', 'very', 'affluent', 'lifestyle.Many', 'modern', 'day', 'saints', 'have', 'been', 'raised', 'poverty', 'sainthood', 'Therese', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'given', 'everything', 'young', 'girl', 'would', 'need', 'wanted', 'yet', 'something', 'someone', 'was', 'still', 'missing', 'soul.The', 'journey', 'soul', 'Therese', 'journey', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'film', 'glimpse', 'struggles', 'ectasies', 'one', 'will', 'encounter', 'once', 'person', 'search', 'more', 'outside', 'oneself.The', 'film', 'Therese', 'journey', 'justice', 'end', 'young', 'girl', 'life', 'not', 'abandoned', 'Therese', 'struggles', 'see', 'God', 'love', 'working', 'soul', 'death', 'announcing', 'great', 'love', 'God', 'pain.Other', 'books', 'journey', 'consideration', 'reviews', 'Who', 'Told', 'Were', 'Naked', 'Freedom', 'Judgement', 'Guilt', 'Fear', 'PunishmentAcceptance', 'self', 'love', 'self', 'God', 'others.Experiencing', 'Depths', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Library', 'Spiritual', 'Classics', 'Volume', '2', 'Jesus', 'way', 'truth.Radical', 'Optimism', 'Rooting', 'RealityA', 'deep', 'luminous', 'vision.Pursuit', 'GodGaze', 'heart', 'GodLiving', 'Presence', 'God', 'Everyday', 'Spirituality', 'Brother', 'Lawrence', '30', 'Days', 'Great', 'Spiritual', 'Teacher', 'Be', 'close', 'heart', 'God.The', 'Dialogue', 'St.', 'Catherine', 'SienaCatherine', 'dialogues', 'God', 'Father.God', 'Dreams', 'Revelation', 'A', 'Christian', 'Interpretation', 'DreamsDreams', 'are', 'gifts', 'God.No', 'Man', 'IslandWithout', 'solitude', 'can', 'be', 'communion.Through', 'Seasons', 'HeartPlease', 'be', 'patient', 'God', 'not', 'finished', 'yet.God', 'CallingLo', 'am', 'always.Grace', 'Every', 'Season', 'Year', 'Catherine', 'Doherty/Daily', 'ReflectionsGrace', 'Every', 'Season', 'Year', 'Catherine', 'De', 'Hueck', 'Doherty', 'A', 'daily', 'dose', 'Catherine', 'spirituality', 'SadhanaSadhana', 'Listen', 'heart']",Therese

This film of Saint Therese of Lisieux from her childhood to her death at 24 from tuberculosis is a bore, which is something I don't like saying about any film of this genre.  Why must saint movies be done with so little character conflict in the storylines that they risk putting both Catholics and non-Catholics to sleep? I have some knowledge of this particular saint's life and, like Saint Bernadette Soubirous of Lourdes, Therese Martin of Lisieux was not a bland individual.  Look at the photo taken of her just before she entered the Carmelite order at age 15.  Her vibrant personality leaps out at you and it continues to do so in a later photo of her where she's wearing her habit.  Unfortunately, I agree with those who reviewed the acting in this film; the performances are yawn producing.  Even the scene where Therese's widower father Leonard happily shouts to her, ""My queen, I caught a fish!"" only made me shrug and think, ""So you caught a fish.  Big deal.""  The saving grace of the film are the production values, as the sets and costumes are flawless.

I was very dissapointed in this film. The quality of acting was poor and sometimes the dialoge didn't makes sense. Also, and to me personally the most annoying aspect of this film, were the inaccuracies regarding monastic life. I mean, if someone is going to make a film where the main character spends the last eight years of her life in a monastery, you'd think they would become at least marginally familiar with monastic culture and customs. Also, the actress who played Saint Therese, and the actresses who played her sisters did not resemble the actual people. I couldn't understand why the director chose the same actress to play Saint Therese as a child and as an adult. The acting of Leonardo diFIllipis was so odd it detracted from the viewing experience. I think perhaps his style of acting is more appropriate for theater. In this film it is just comical. The historical innaccurices abound in this movie, and anyone who is familiar with the life of Saint Therese of Lisieux will notice them. Carmelite life is rigorous, and was even more so at the time when Therese was living.Where is the manual labor and silences?  Where is the affectionate, warm and pious family atmosphere of her childhood? Why was the portrayal of her last illness and death so romanticized? This woman suffered from a terrible illness, tuberculosis, and died horribly.  Where were ANY of the beautiful last conversations? Where were the community politics? To give credit where credit is due, I think that the filmmakers were trying to make a film that captured the spirit or spirituality of Saint THerese, rather than a strictly historical drama. However, they failed miserably. If they had succeeded they would have made a masterpiece. I think the best thing about this movie was the costume design and set design, which was pretty good. I'm still waiting for a great movie about Saint Therese, and I hope that it will be made some day; this not that movie. This movie is recommended, but only for those who already know the historical details of her life and will not be put off by poor filmmaking.",3,Disappointing,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,2196,"['gave', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'was', 'Saint', 'Therese', 'not', 'quality', 'filmmaking', 'was', 'very', 'dissapointed', 'film', 'quality', 'acting', 'was', 'poor', 'dialoge', 'did', ""n't"", 'sense', 'Also', 'personally', 'most', 'annoying', 'aspect', 'film', 'were', 'inaccuracies', 'regarding', 'monastic', 'life', 'mean', 'someone', 'going', 'make', 'film', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'last', 'eight', 'years', 'life', 'monastery', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'become', 'least', 'marginally', 'familiar', 'monastic', 'culture', 'customs', 'Also', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Saint', 'Therese', 'actresses', 'who', 'played', 'sisters', 'did', 'not', 'resemble', 'actual', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'director', 'chose', 'same', 'actress', 'play', 'Saint', 'Therese', 'child', 'adult', 'acting', 'Leonardo', 'diFIllipis', 'was', 'so', 'odd', 'detracted', 'viewing', 'experience', 'think', 'perhaps', 'style', 'acting', 'more', 'appropriate', 'theater', 'film', 'just', 'comical', 'historical', 'innaccurices', 'abound', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'familiar', 'life', 'Saint', 'Therese', 'Lisieux', 'will', 'notice', 'Carmelite', 'life', 'rigorous', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'time', 'when', 'Therese', 'was', 'manual', 'labor', 'silences', 'Where', 'affectionate', 'warm', 'pious', 'family', 'atmosphere', 'childhood', 'Why', 'was', 'portrayal', 'last', 'illness', 'death', 'so', 'romanticized', 'woman', 'suffered', 'terrible', 'illness', 'tuberculosis', 'died', 'horribly', 'Where', 'were', 'ANY', 'beautiful', 'last', 'conversations', 'Where', 'were', 'community', 'politics', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'film', 'captured', 'spirit', 'spirituality', 'Saint', 'THerese', 'rather', 'strictly', 'historical', 'drama', 'However', 'failed', 'miserably', 'had', 'succeeded', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'masterpiece', 'think', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'costume', 'design', 'set', 'design', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'great', 'movie', 'Saint', 'Therese', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'day', 'not', 'movie', 'movie', 'recommended', 'only', 'who', 'already', 'know', 'historical', 'details', 'life', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'poor', 'filmmaking']",Therese

Although somewhat disappointed in the film's quality in the theater (seemed rather grainy), we were very pleased with this film as a whole. I believe it was rather fortunate that my children needed a visit to the restroom during the ""death scene"", for I (as the one who remained in the theater) found this scene very emotional. We left the theater anxious for the DVD release.When the announcement arrived that the DVD could be pre-ordered for a Valentine's day release, I immediately ordered 4 copies: one for ourselves, and 3 others for family and dear friends. All who received the DVD (none had seen the film in the theater) were moved and inspired while viewing it.When my husband and I sat down to enjoy the DVD presentation with all five of our children, the results were quite surprising. The 2, 4, and 5-year-olds were ""glued"" to the screen! Our oldest, who had missed the death scene in the theater and is now 8 1/2, ""went to pieces"" when Therese died! I myself, even knowing what was to come, found myself weeping as Therese went to be with the God she loved with every fiber of her being!I found the actors to be very ""natural"" in their portrayals of the Saint, her family, and the many religious she encountered throughout her short life. This is what made this film so refreshing: it's simplicity allows one to ""think beyond the film"" and allow the Holy Spirit and the imagination to run wild!And considering that Luke Films does not have the financial resources of a Mel Gibson, they produced a beautifully inspiring film for the entire family to enjoy that was heartily endorced by the Vatican and our beloved Pope John Paul II!! There can be no better earthly endorcement than this!I recommend this film to everyone. Since television and movies are the farthest reaching media in today's world, doesn't it make sense that we should promote more ""heart and soul-healthy"" films such as this one?

940678,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000BDGVT0,MollyRK,"[20, 27]","Such are the words that St. Therese of Liseux utters as she lies on her death bed in the final minutes of the movie. The incredible story of one of the world's most beloved modern-day saints is something that cannot quite be conveyed in its entirety in just a 96-minute film, but the direction this movie takes is immediately evident when you begin watching.From the film's opening moments, where a very young Therese says ""Oh Mama, how I wish you would die, because I want you to go to Heaven,"" to the painful recognition of human suffering in the climatic final scene, we are introduced to a young girl who just may have had more to her than most people come to believe. As human beings, we tend to view the saints as strong, credible, and virtually flawless souls that we could never hope to emulate.And it is a shame that so many of us tend to feel that way, because the saints were not perfect. In fact, some of the very best of them became saints through the human mistakes they overcame, not the sins they avoided.With this phenomenal gem of a film, the viewer gets to witness an amazing sense of hope in seeing the story of a girl who was certainly not perfect and was even a normal human person. From the tiny 5-year-old child who kept the death of her mother bottled up inside to the dramatic girl who dreaded school, and from the immature, needy teenager to the loving and selfless young adult she came to be, St. Therese clearly experienced a significant metamorphosis in her life. She was born to two devout Catholic parents that also happened to be very wealthy, and as the youngest of five girls she was about as pampered and spoiled as any ""baby of the family"" you might see today.There are a lot of things about Therese that might surprise you. She was a child who loved dressing up in pretty outfits and enjoyed playing with her sisters. She was a kid who struggled to cope with the sneers of the ""popular"" girls in school and found joy in being at home, dancing and laughing with her family. She missed her mother greatly, pouted when her beloved oldest sister left home to become a Carmelite nun, and even had a nervous breakdown when she realized she couldn't deal with it all. She was a little girl who loved having dessert after dinner, picked flowers, and looked forward to the presents that ""Santa Claus"" stuffed in her shoes.It is a breath of clean and pure fresh air to watch little Therese grow up, mature, and develop a strong and loving relationship with God. It is empowering to know that while she did grow into a woman who put others before herself and was constantly giving, she was not always that way. It is even more incredible to see her talk about and live out her ""Little Way,"" something that helped her recognize that while she was not perfect and could not do everything exactly as Jesus did, she could do her part by focusing on the little things with the utmost love and sacrifice.This film definitely does leave a lot of information about Therese's world. The fact that her parents actually had 9 children and lost 4 during infancy is one part that is not discussed. There are also many tiny elements of Therese's incredible life that are left out, but then again I don't think they were looking to paint a complete portrait here. The makers of this film obviously worked very hard to make this an appealing story to contemporary audiences. Given the fact that the world we currently live in is nowhere near the same as it was when the saints lived, that must have been a very difficult thing to do, and it was obviously a tremendous success. They knew that they can reach people by bringing out the emotional, human side of this wonderful saint.

She uses her ""Little Way"" to perform small acts of compassion and kindness, even for those who are not grateful for the help she bestows.The film is great in its simplicity, and it would have worked perfectly, it didn't come up a bit short.  At an hour and a half, the film is not nearly long enough for the viewer to truly grasp and appreciate the young Therese.  Nearly half of the film is spent on her childhood.  This isn't bad or wrong, but at an hour and a half, it doesn't leave enough time to really get into depth of her life, especially while she is at the monastery.The film is made in the tradition of ""Song of Bernadette,"" which is still the best film made about a saint to this day, in my opinion.  The ""Song of Bernadette"" is also about two and a half hours long, giving the film-makers and the audience more than sufficient time to really fall in love with Bernadette.  This is what I was waiting for with this film, but it didn't happen.  At 25, Jennifer Jones was able to really bring out the simple, child-like qualities of Bernadette.I'm also afraid that Lindsay Younce, while a good actress, just isn't able to wholly grasp the character of Therese.  I don't think it's necessarily her fault.  It's quite a task to act as a famous saint.  I still remember Ben Kingsley's statement when first offered the part of Gandhi ""I can't play Gandhi.  NO ONE can play him.  He's larger than life!""  And yet, he was able to tap into the essence of Gandhi.There are some very sweet and tender moments in this film.  I love the relationship between Therese and the senior nun who tries her best to make Therese's life miserable.  When Therese smiles at her, the nun asks, ""Why do you smile?""  ""Because I'm so happy to see you,"" replies Therese who quickly disarms the nun with these sweet words of love.I really feel that if Leonardo had stretched out his film for at least another hour, and really dug a little deeper, he would have had a masterpiece, without question.  It's beautifully photographed, and the relationships he shows between Therese and her father as well as with her sisters is wonderful to see.Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie by any means.  It simply isn't enough.  I feel that Leonardo's attempt to make a simple film was admirable, but even simple films can run longer than an hour and a half!",3,Touching Film Too Short to Really Tap Into the Heart and Soul,1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,2586,"['was', 'very', 'eager', 'watch', 'film', 'find', 'most', 'films', 'saints', 'be', 'extremely', 'inspiring', 'compelling.This', 'simple', 'film', 'simple', 'woman', 'Therese', 'who', 'young', 'French', 'woman', 'who', 'immediate', 'connection', 'nature', 'people', 'Little', 'Way', 'perform', 'small', 'acts', 'compassion', 'kindness', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'grateful', 'help', 'film', 'great', 'simplicity', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'bit', 'short', 'hour', 'half', 'film', 'not', 'nearly', 'long', 'enough', 'viewer', 'truly', 'grasp', 'appreciate', 'young', 'Therese', 'Nearly', 'half', 'film', 'spent', 'childhood', ""n't"", 'bad', 'wrong', 'hour', 'half', ""n't"", 'leave', 'enough', 'time', 'really', 'get', 'depth', 'life', 'especially', 'monastery.The', 'film', 'made', 'tradition', 'Song', 'Bernadette', 'still', 'best', 'film', 'made', 'saint', 'day', 'opinion', 'Song', 'Bernadette', 'also', 'about', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'giving', 'film-makers', 'audience', 'more', 'sufficient', 'time', 'really', 'fall', 'love', 'Bernadette', 'what', 'was', 'waiting', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', '25', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'was', 'able', 'really', 'bring', 'out', 'simple', 'child-like', 'qualities', 'Bernadette.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'afraid', 'Lindsay', 'Younce', 'good', 'actress', 'just', ""n't"", 'able', 'wholly', 'grasp', 'character', 'Therese', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'necessarily', 'fault', 'quite', 'task', 'act', 'famous', 'saint', 'still', 'remember', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'statement', 'when', 'first', 'offered', 'part', 'Gandhi', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'Gandhi', 'ONE', 'can', 'play', 'larger', 'life', 'yet', 'was', 'able', 'tap', 'essence', 'Gandhi.There', 'are', 'very', 'sweet', 'tender', 'moments', 'film', 'love', 'relationship', 'Therese', 'senior', 'nun', 'who', 'best', 'make', 'Therese', 'life', 'miserable', 'When', 'Therese', 'smiles', 'nun', 'Why', 'do', 'smile', ""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'Therese', 'who', 'quickly', 'nun', 'sweet', 'words', 'love.I', 'really', 'feel', 'Leonardo', 'had', 'stretched', 'out', 'film', 'least', 'hour', 'really', 'dug', 'little', 'deeper', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'masterpiece', 'question', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'relationships', 'Therese', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'sisters', 'wonderful', 'see.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'means', 'simply', ""n't"", 'enough', 'feel', 'Leonardo', 'attempt', 'make', 'simple', 'film', 'was', 'admirable', 'even', 'simple', 'films', 'can', 'run', 'longer', 'hour', 'half']",Therese

940688,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000BDGVT0,Timothy Kearney,"[25, 34]","THERESE is a contemporary retelling of the life of St. Therese of Liseux. The film tells the basic story of her life and quotes from her writings are used to narrate the story. The story is told from a reverential and pious perspective which for some films gives an unrealistic quality, but for THERESE, it's actually helpful. The viewer connects with the saint's life and witness. In some ways it has some of the same strengths of the St. Francis of Assisi biopic BROTHER SUN, SISTER MOON but on a lesser scale than that of producer Franco Zefferelli.Perhaps what sold me most on this film was not the film itself, but the story behind the film which is an additional feature to the DVD. For everyone involved, the production was a labor of love. It was obviously a small studio with a limited budget, yet the scenery was lush, the acting sincere, and the musical score helped the film flow. The purpose was to tell the saint's story in a memorable way and this the team accomplished rather well.My guess is that this film will be viewed primarily by people interested in Catholic spirituality or in a religious educational setting. Either would be a perfect use for the film. We get a glimpse of Therese's struggles and successes. We see her mature form a child who is at times overly curious about religion to a woman of deep faith. She also teaches us, to paraphrase from a modern expression and book title, not to sweat the small stuff and how not sweating the small stuff can actually lead to holiness. It would be perfect to be viewed by a large group with the possibility of discussion afterward.",4,A Loving Retelling of the Life of St. Therese,1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,1604,"['THERESE', 'contemporary', 'retelling', 'life', 'St.', 'Therese', 'Liseux', 'film', 'basic', 'story', 'life', 'quotes', 'writings', 'are', 'used', 'narrate', 'story', 'story', 'told', 'reverential', 'pious', 'perspective', 'films', 'unrealistic', 'quality', 'THERESE', 'actually', 'helpful', 'viewer', 'saint', 'life', 'witness', 'ways', 'same', 'strengths', 'St.', 'Francis', 'Assisi', 'biopic', 'BROTHER', 'SUN', 'SISTER', 'MOON', 'lesser', 'scale', 'producer', 'Franco', 'Zefferelli.Perhaps', 'what', 'sold', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'story', 'film', 'additional', 'feature', 'DVD', 'everyone', 'involved', 'production', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'was', 'obviously', 'small', 'studio', 'limited', 'budget', 'scenery', 'was', 'lush', 'acting', 'sincere', 'musical', 'score', 'helped', 'film', 'flow', 'purpose', 'was', 'tell', 'saint', 'story', 'memorable', 'way', 'team', 'accomplished', 'rather', 'well.My', 'guess', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'viewed', 'primarily', 'people', 'interested', 'Catholic', 'spirituality', 'religious', 'educational', 'setting', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'use', 'film', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Therese', 'struggles', 'successes', 'see', 'mature', 'form', 'child', 'who', 'times', 'overly', 'curious', 'religion', 'woman', 'deep', 'faith', 'also', 'paraphrase', 'modern', 'expression', 'book', 'title', 'not', 'sweat', 'small', 'stuff', 'how', 'not', 'sweating', 'small', 'stuff', 'can', 'actually', 'lead', 'holiness', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'be', 'viewed', 'large', 'group', 'possibility', 'discussion', 'afterward']",Therese

940690,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B000BDGVT0,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[1, 2]","A beautiful film on St. Therese of Lisieux, a 19th century French bourgeois girl who became world-famous through her autobiography after dying young of TB in a convent. As an independently produced Catholic indie, it is primarily hampered by a so-so lead performance by amateur actress Lindsey Younce, whose stilted delivery evokes high school theater. Early scenes of family interactions follow ""The Story of a Soul"" (autobiography) pretty closely, but the inexperienced Younce is so unexpressive/wooden and petulant that some of these moments are painful to watch. Nevertheless, the mysterious source of strength in Therese's short life -- a cheerful joy for life rooted in faith despite her many sufferings -- emerges gradually as she loses her mother to an early death, her father to mental illness, and finally her own life to illness.If nothing else, Younce plays her deathbed scenes with heartfelt depth, making up a bit for the lack of gravitas throughout the rest of the film. In the final illness scenes, it feels like we're watching St. Therese rather than Younce, saving the performance. There are other highlights. Director Leonardo DeFilippis achieves a rich cinematic look augmented by a beautiful film score that helps carry us through the inconsistency of Younce's frequent church-pageant acting flourishes. He also plays Louis Martin, Therese's father, with a studied sensitivity and warmth that is a highlight of the film.Overall, the film is superior to Alain Cavalier's celebrated ""Therese"" (a 1986 French winner at the Cannes Film Festival) inasmuch as it gives a more straightforward narrative of this woman's life. Cavalier's film has greater depth, a better lead actress, and a more beautifully subtle treatment of the source material -- but its European minimalism, vignette-driven narrative, long periods of silence, uncomfortable religious sexuality, agnostic distance, and lack of context may puzzle some viewers who may desire a more straightforward treatment of Therese's life. This newer film, while inferior in artistry and acting to that of Cavalier, is better for narrative coherence and may be more appealing for English audiences since it lacks subtitles. It is suitable for family or church viewing and appears intended for that audience. Unlikely to appeal to non-believers, it is nevertheless calculated to be uplifting for believers, and I for one have come to appreciate it from that perspective. It may also be preferable for American audiences and younger viewers who find the French minimalism of Cavalier's film bewildering. The Little Flower still awaits a truly powerful cinematic treatment, but this film is probably the best of the bunch for now. Incidentally, Amazon needs to correct the date on this product listing: This ""Therese"" came out in 2004, not in 1986 as it says on this page.

I am a Catholic and have been devout to the St. Therese of Lisieux for most of my adult life and I was really looking forward to this film.  Like many of the other reviewers, I have also seen the French film of the same title and found it a far more rewarding experience than this new production.  The movie plays out like a religious Anne of Green Gables, with a Hallmark film quality that manages to gloss over everything to the point of making every character come across as one-dimensional cut outs of piety and wholesomeness.  Having read Story of a Soul, I know that Therese was not a faultless divine creation, but rather a very human woman with an extraordinary devotion to, love for and faith in God.  Everyone is so saccharine sweet and perfect that it bordered on the sickening.  It just wasn't believable.  Even more so, using the same actress to portray Therese from the age of 14 to 24 was an insane idea (Lindsay Younce was 21 at the time of filming).  Not only do we not witness her spiritual growth but there is no sense of the passing of time. The acting is a bit pedestrian and the dialogue an exercise in stilted screenwriting, the music hockey and contrived, but the production values are high and the movie has beautiful look to it.  No doubt everyone's heart was in the right place but this is just not the kind of film that will really shed any light on Therese Martin, woman and Saint.",2,I'm sorry to write this....,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,1561,"['feel', ""'m"", 'being', 'way', 'sacrilegious', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'attempt', 'portray', 'extraordinary', 'person', 'least', 'life', 'am', 'Catholic', 'have', 'been', 'devout', 'St.', 'Therese', 'Lisieux', 'most', 'adult', 'life', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'French', 'film', 'same', 'title', 'found', 'far', 'more', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'new', 'production', 'movie', 'out', 'religious', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Hallmark', 'film', 'quality', 'gloss', 'over', 'everything', 'point', 'making', 'character', 'come', 'one-dimensional', 'cut', 'outs', 'piety', 'wholesomeness', 'Having', 'read', 'Story', 'Soul', 'know', 'Therese', 'was', 'not', 'faultless', 'divine', 'creation', 'rather', 'very', 'human', 'woman', 'extraordinary', 'devotion', 'love', 'faith', 'God', 'Everyone', 'so', 'saccharine', 'sweet', 'perfect', 'bordered', 'sickening', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'Even', 'more', 'so', 'using', 'same', 'actress', 'portray', 'Therese', 'age', '14', '24', 'was', 'insane', 'idea', 'Lindsay', 'Younce', 'was', '21', 'time', 'filming', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'not', 'witness', 'spiritual', 'growth', 'sense', 'passing', 'time', 'acting', 'bit', 'pedestrian', 'dialogue', 'exercise', 'stilted', 'screenwriting', 'music', 'hockey', 'contrived', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'look', 'doubt', 'everyone', 'heart', 'was', 'right', 'place', 'just', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'will', 'really', 'shed', 'light', 'Therese', 'Martin', 'woman', 'Saint']",Therese
