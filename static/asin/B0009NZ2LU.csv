Keith Carradine and Mare Winningham are also excellent in their roles. The story line is simple but interesting, with just enough tension to keep it from being too syrupy. The film makers did an excellent job of invoking early 20th century America, although if you look closely, you can see a few anachronisms that are out of place (these don't detract from the movie, but they're fun to look for).This movie is well worth a look, definitely something different from the usual fare, and something for the whole family.",5,A wonderful movie!,1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,659,"['member', 'family', 'should', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Skyler', 'Day', 'superb', 'Ociee', 'Nash', 'loved', 'Anthony', 'P.', 'Rodriguez', 'Gypsy', 'John', 'Leon', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'roles', 'story', 'line', 'simple', 'interesting', 'just', 'enough', 'tension', 'keep', 'being', 'too', 'syrupy', 'film', 'makers', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'invoking', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'America', 'look', 'closely', 'can', 'see', 'few', 'anachronisms', 'are', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'movie', ""'re"", 'fun', 'look', '.This', 'movie', 'well', 'look', 'definitely', 'something', 'different', 'usual', 'fare', 'something', 'whole', 'family']",The Adventures of Ociee Nash

The film takes you back to a gentler age and introduces you to a delightful free spirit of a girl, Ociee Nash. It's a family-firendly film that really entertains and leaves you with the feeling that here is a girl Mark Twain would have liked. It's that kind of film, but instead of having a boy as the main character, Ociee is a very special girl, one who Huck Finn would have accepted for her grit, joyful personality, and sterling character. I recommend this film to any family with young girls or boys. Let them get a glimpse into an age that seems quaint now, but was so American not so very long ago.",5,Ociee Nash a gem,1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,666,"['young', 'old', 'will', 'love', 'Adventures', 'Ociee', 'Nash', 'film', 'back', 'gentler', 'age', 'introduces', 'delightful', 'free', 'spirit', 'girl', 'Ociee', 'Nash', 'family-firendly', 'film', 'really', 'feeling', 'here', 'girl', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'kind', 'film', 'instead', 'having', 'boy', 'main', 'character', 'Ociee', 'very', 'special', 'girl', 'one', 'who', 'Huck', 'Finn', 'would', 'have', 'accepted', 'grit', 'joyful', 'personality', 'sterling', 'character', 'recommend', 'film', 'family', 'young', 'girls', 'boys', 'Let', 'get', 'glimpse', 'age', 'quaint', 'now', 'was', 'so', 'American', 'not', 'so', 'very', 'long', 'ago']",The Adventures of Ociee Nash

Porter,"[8, 18]","Being more of a traditional family, the cleaness of the movie was important to me, and that was one of the primary reasons for me choosing this family movie. As far as the content goes, I didn't find much to have issue with although there were a few things that I didn't care for too much that were minor (such as the kids being obnoxious with chewing with their mouths open, throwing rocks and getting into general kid trouble, repeatedly disobeying and not getting much as far as consequence goes other than a little talk, girls being really mean to one another and hitting and rolling around on the ground, children running away with an attitude and kicking things when their parents have made decisions for them that they don't like, adults in the film acting primarly like children, etc...).  However, alot was also good about it, like showing the reasons why these things were bad, teaching some good manners, etc... it's just that I would rather the main character be generally exemplary in behaviour while making a few mistakes, rather than simply doing what she wants to do and getting little talks with some pretty serious stuff, which obviously don't help her as you can see by her going and doing more of the same. Granted, her forwardness and bravery DOES shine through in helping out her fellow man in life saving ways a time or two, but overall I did not care for the main character's morals.But all that is secondary, and like I said, minor. The thing that I could absolutely NOT stand about the movie was the cheesiness of it. The opening scene I noticed that Ociee was not acting well, she was ACTING as if she KNEW the camera was filming her, and the bulk of the acting in the film continued along these lines, just extremely poorly done. It didn't help that there were just so many ridiculous situations, that I just sat there and rolled my eyes, and overall I was just totally irritated with the entire film. In my opinion it is a very poor movie. And I LIKE to watch children's movie and am a huge fan of the Chronicles of Narnia, Toy Story and others along the same lines, but I cannot stand cheap, cheesy movies which are simply ridiculous. Yes, it's generally clean, and it has some good story lines, but that doesn't save it. If this is what I have to watch in order to have a fully ""clean"" movie, I would rather not!",1,Extremely disappointed,1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,2343,"['Being', 'more', 'traditional', 'family', 'cleaness', 'movie', 'was', 'important', 'was', 'one', 'primary', 'reasons', 'choosing', 'family', 'movie', 'As', 'far', 'content', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'have', 'issue', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'were', 'minor', 'such', 'kids', 'being', 'obnoxious', 'chewing', 'mouths', 'open', 'throwing', 'rocks', 'getting', 'general', 'kid', 'trouble', 'repeatedly', 'disobeying', 'not', 'getting', 'much', 'as', 'far', 'consequence', 'other', 'little', 'talk', 'girls', 'being', 'really', 'mean', 'one', 'hitting', 'rolling', 'around', 'ground', 'children', 'running', 'away', 'attitude', 'kicking', 'things', 'when', 'parents', 'have', 'made', 'decisions', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'adults', 'film', 'acting', 'primarly', 'children', 'etc', 'However', 'alot', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'showing', 'reasons', 'why', 'things', 'were', 'bad', 'teaching', 'good', 'manners', 'etc', 'just', 'would', 'rather', 'main', 'character', 'be', 'generally', 'exemplary', 'behaviour', 'making', 'few', 'mistakes', 'rather', 'simply', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'getting', 'little', 'talks', 'pretty', 'serious', 'stuff', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'can', 'see', 'going', 'doing', 'more', 'same', 'Granted', 'forwardness', 'bravery', 'DOES', 'shine', 'helping', 'out', 'fellow', 'man', 'life', 'saving', 'ways', 'time', 'two', 'overall', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'main', 'character', 'morals.But', 'secondary', 'said', 'minor', 'thing', 'could', 'absolutely', 'NOT', 'stand', 'movie', 'was', 'cheesiness', 'opening', 'scene', 'noticed', 'Ociee', 'was', 'not', 'acting', 'well', 'was', 'ACTING', 'KNEW', 'camera', 'was', 'filming', 'bulk', 'acting', 'film', 'continued', 'lines', 'just', 'extremely', 'poorly', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'situations', 'just', 'sat', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'overall', 'was', 'just', 'totally', 'irritated', 'entire', 'film', 'opinion', 'very', 'poor', 'movie', 'LIKE', 'watch', 'children', 'movie', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Toy', 'Story', 'others', 'same', 'lines', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'cheap', 'cheesy', 'movies', 'are', 'simply', 'ridiculous', 'Yes', 'generally', 'clean', 'good', 'story', 'lines', ""n't"", 'save', 'what', 'have', 'watch', 'order', 'have', 'fully', 'clean', 'movie', 'would', 'rather', 'not']",The Adventures of Ociee Nash

All of that good work in making a colorful, light, and playful world lost in complete ineptitude from everyone else who worked on this movie.The story is actually a good one, despite cliches.  A young girl (9 years) named Ociee Nash from Mississippi is turning out to be something of a tomboy, which her father worries about because of her lack of a mother (died from measles).  He sends her to her prim and proper Tennessee aunt, and along the way she has a cheery and profound effect on everyone she meets, including the Wright brothers and the President of the United States, among others.It's based on a book, and something tells me that book is probably really good.  This movie, however, loses everything that was given to it, literally given to it, by being incredibly flat and mispaced.  The dramatic effect from the shots is completely lost, the acting is terrible (yeah yeah, I know they're kids... they were still terrible), and it's almost insulting to try to watch an hour and a half of their strained, horrible accents.  1898 Ociee Nash sounds like a California Valley Girl, the adult actors literally sound like they refuse to even try, and it looks like the editor took whichever the first shot they finished was and just threw it together, cutting only sufficiently enough to look like it was planned.Whereas I give this only one star out of five, it earns that one star for its try and its pretty pictures.

However, ""The Adventures of Ociee Nash"" is not the right vehicle to showcase her talents.  This story is somewhat empty, leaving the viewer frustrated; hoping for a real story similar to Polyanna.  If you watch Polyanna, or Anne Of Green Gables, you will see just how poor this story is by comparrison.  The music is not very good.  It is very loud throughout most of the story and off cue in every respect.  The acting of Ociee's father is not believable or realistic.  The directing is somewhat poor. I did enjoy seeing Ociee whip the sissy girl in her new neighborhood, and the train ride was very nice.  Overall, this movie missed a good chance to become something really special.  However, after watching it again two or three more times - I discover that the movie is entertaining and fun - entirely owing to Skylar Day... she is just wonderful.  MY 77 year old mother loved this movie!  This caused me to upgrade my original review; rating same from 3 to 4 stars.
