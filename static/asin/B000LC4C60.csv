It always made me feel like I could share a part of my Dad's work life because he was very quiet, at least around me, about the things that happened at work. As an adult, with a sister who is now in the department, watching this show is kinda funny because of how advanced we have become. (No longer are there separate ambulances that come to transport the patient to the hospital.) The scenery/costuming, etc. is also neat to me because it is so 70's. The special effects are cheesy because, again as an adult, I can tell it's not real, but to my eyes as a child, it was as real as could be. The actors, specifically Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe, have great chemistry and worked well together. Keeping in mind that the show was set in the era of sex, drugs and rock n'roll, it's a really good show. Has some comedy and lots of drama/action.

I remember watching this great show on Saturday nights back when I was in high school. In those days, the networks put the good TV shows on Saturdays. Today, Saturday night is a graveyard for the pseudo-cancelled. It's hard to believe that 35 years ago the concept of the paramedic was a novel one, and this is a great show about the problems and personal lives of those involved in those early days of the program.Emergency kept the pace fast and interesting with a combination of strange, dramatic, and even humorous cases. More unusual cases this season include the rescue of a boy trapped inside his own homemade rocket, a man who has difficulty breathing because he has swallowed his partial dental plate, an amateur magician trapped in a safe, a bank robbery hostage has symptoms of a heart attack and the paramedics have to treat him at gunpoint, a patient with an earache caused by mothballs, and an artist trapped inside his own sculpture.The personal side of Emergency is interesting too. The chemistry between paramedics John Gage and Roy DeSoto is great and their various misadventures are frequently humorous. They're good friends but quite different people. Roy is a family man through and through, and John is a carefree single guy. I remember one particularly funny conversation in which John is actually thinking about marriage but is not sure he and the girl have known each other long enough. He asks Roy how long he knew his wife before they got married and Roy says 12 years. When John says that is a ridiculous period of time to wait, Roy mentions that he and his wife met in the fourth grade. That's a pretty typical conversation for the two. I highly recommend this series. If you've never seen it, even though medicine has changed drastically, it is still good entertainment.

Universal did a decent job with the quality of Seasons 1 and 2 but Season 3 is a step backward in many respects. First the good. The use of single sided disks is a much welcome change and I had no freezing problems like I did with Season 1 and 2.Unfortunately, the quality of individual episodes isn't as good. I don't mind the fact they used the syndication opening. But Universal obviously didn't bother to go into their own archives to use the original tapes or film and that's dissapointing. The storage of what they did use must not have been very good because certain scenes in episodes appear ""washed out"" or have occasional lines, much like you occasionally see on old film. What is most dissapointing however is that the copies they used have content left out from when they originally aired. There is an entire scene in the episode Propinquity that many Emergency! fans have never seen which occured in one of the main character's apartment. That scene does not appear in the DVD version. That's particularly unfortunate because Seasons 1 and 2 did include many of the scenes cut out of TVLand's presentation.I am happy Universal finally came through on getting the season out and I hope will get the rest of the series done, but the quality of the presentation is dissapointing.",3,Great Show...Mediocre presentation by Universal,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,1373,"['have', 'been', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'release', 'Season', '3', 'absolutely', 'love', 'Emergency', 'Universal', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'quality', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'Season', '3', 'step', 'backward', 'many', 'respects', 'First', 'good', 'use', 'single', 'sided', 'disks', 'much', 'welcome', 'change', 'had', 'freezing', 'problems', 'did', 'Season', '1', '2.Unfortunately', 'quality', 'individual', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'fact', 'used', 'syndication', 'opening', 'Universal', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'go', 'own', 'archives', 'use', 'original', 'tapes', 'film', 'dissapointing', 'storage', 'what', 'did', 'use', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'certain', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'appear', 'washed', 'out', 'have', 'occasional', 'lines', 'much', 'occasionally', 'see', 'old', 'film', 'What', 'most', 'dissapointing', 'however', 'copies', 'used', 'have', 'content', 'left', 'out', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'entire', 'scene', 'episode', 'Propinquity', 'many', 'Emergency', 'fans', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'occured', 'one', 'main', 'character', 'apartment', 'scene', 'not', 'appear', 'DVD', 'version', 'particularly', 'unfortunate', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'did', 'include', 'many', 'scenes', 'cut', 'TVLand', 'presentation.I', 'am', 'happy', 'Universal', 'finally', 'came', 'getting', 'season', 'hope', 'will', 'get', 'rest', 'series', 'done', 'quality', 'presentation', 'dissapointing']",Emergency!

EMERGENCY was indeed, ahead of it's time.There are so many shows I loved as a kid. I have revisited many of these shows years later and found myself scratching my head in dismay that I could have EVER actually liked that!Then you have EMERGENCY!I was in grade school when I loved this show. I watched it religiously. Now fast forward 40 years into the future. I haven't watched EMERGENCY since the 1970's when it first came out. I have forgotten all the episodes and story lines. It's like I'm watching them all again for the first time.I was a big fan of ER. You would think after ER with all its quality and realism, EMERGENCY, a spin-off show from ADAM 12 (Remember THAT???) wouldn't even remotely compare. That's what I thought.Ok, granted, the show is dated. You can't get around this fact. There were no computers then, or cell phones. Digital did not exist. Everything takes longer. Even the phones are DIAL phones, not even the button variety. The cars all look like boats--it's laughable. The first season the ambulances look like white hearses. The hair styles...everyone looks like they just emerged from a hair salon--the men too. The nurses are all female with the funny paper hats, and most of them obviously wearing false eyelashes. There is no swearing. In the first season not one single person dies. The dialog is laughable in some places. And yet....One thing that's cool about EMERGENCY--you're looking at real fires. Some of the scenes are actually quite amazing when you consider when this show was filmed. EMERGENCY simply WAS the &#34;ER&#34; of its day. It was the best television could offer, and in my view, ahead of its time.By Season Three we see a bit more modern style vehicles. The ambulances look more like they do today, and so do the fire trucks. But people die sometimes. You have that little bit of added realism.Strengths that carry through every season I've watches so far-- EMERGENCY is character driven. I defy anyone to try to watch this show and not fall in love with firemen paramedics Johnny and Roy, or laugh at Chet Desoto's practical jokes, or feel along with the head nurse Dixey.McCall.ER was great, but EMERGENCY did it first. ER probably wouldn't have been what it was without this founding show which demonstrates the importance of strong, multi-faceted, FEELING characters.You will be transported back in time in EMERGENCY. After you get through Season Two you will be used to the outdated styles of clothing, cars, technology and mentality. In a way Emergency is a time capsule in that respect. The 1970's get to live again. And though every now and then you'll be brought up short (when it comes to the attitudes/portrayal of women back then especially), much of the time you will forget the outdatedness of the show because you will be so caught up in the STORY.I am again, to Season Four and so far not one story hasn't been exciting, funny, interesting, moving. EMERGENCY has still got it. If you loved ER, you need to experience this show that came first.As for the quality of the DVDs--they are bar none. I feel, for the most part, like I'm watching them new again on TV.

1038368,AJDOJANK50QJV,B000LC4C60,D. McSherry,"[2, 2]","I remember seeing the episode of ""The Old Engine"", where the second Engine 51 (the Ward La France is delivered).  That first run where Johnny and Roy ""hop on the back"" of the new engine took me back to the day when I ran my first call on the engine in 1989.  I couldn't help standing up in the house and imitating Johnny and Roy hopping on the back of the new engine.  The volunteer fire department I was in had two Ward La France engines just like Engine 51 with one exception - they were white instead of red.  My department did not replace these two engines (one was delivered circa 1971 and the other about 1974) until 1993 and 1994.  They worked well for what we used them for, and our maintenance captain kept them up good (I miss him, he died about two years ago).Few will remember that Ward La France donated Engine 51 to Universal Studios (after the series ended in 1977, the LACoFD used it at Station 60 at Universal Studios until it was retired elsewhere), and it was driven from the factory in Elmira, NY (Ward La France is now closed) to Los Angeles, CA.  A crew manned by Mike Stoker (he was a real firefighter who drove Engine 51 on the show), Ed McFall and Mike Stearns (Mike and Ed were real paramedics from the early days - had John Gage been real, he would of been in Ed's Class. Mike was in the first class of six men, so had Desoto been real, he would of been there with him), and Dick Friend (Dick was the Public Information officer for the LaCoFD, he passed away about two years ago) and  drove the Engine and arranged to make frequent stops in several cities to do demonstrations at shopping centers for the paramedic program.  Keep in mind this was the summer of 1973, and a few spectators were like ""do the real guys REALLY do that on the street, or is that just TV?""  Yes, the real guys REALLY did this - and the show EMERGENCY! helped spread the paramedic concept.Like many, as said in other reviews (EMT's, fire captains), I watched Emergency! as a kid, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Quite a few firefighters, EMT's, paramedics, doctors, and nurses in my age bracket (35-50) watched Emergency! as children, and I have to admit it did have something to do with why I spent 5 years in a volunteer fire department, and my motivation to go to EMT school during the summer of 1987.As I watch some episodes, they take me back to reminisce about the fire department and remembering calls, some are similar to EMERGENCY!  I liked Chet because he reminded me of an old Lieutenant I had, who could be a ""goof off"", but when the bell rang he got serious.  Captain Stanley often reminds me of my two fire captains, who both had direction and knowledge was always helpful.  Those captains (and my EMS Lieutenant and maintenance captain) looked out for me and helped trained me.EMERGENCY! had a lot of authenticity that Jack Webb and R.A. Cinader insisted on.  There was a show that came out in the mid-1990's (LA Firefighters) where both LA County and LA City representatives said after LA Firefighters came out (which lasted only 6 episodes, Rescue 77 also had a short run, something like 8 episodes), neither department would lend there name to a TV series again.  That should be a statement about the quality of American Television today.  Back in the seventies, family hour was reserved for Saturday night - what happened?  Now, CBS and NBC dedicate Saturday night to showing re-runs of other shows, like Law and Order, Cold Case, Without a Trace, or one of the CSI's.EMERGENCY! set a good example for a standard of television (we never saw Gage going to bed with his dates, or talking inappropiately about others) and was a good show for the Saturday night family hour. Hollywood - bring some quality back.  While I occasionally watch ""Law and Order SVU"" (or Criminal Intent) and ""CSI: NY"" (I don't like the Miami one and Without a Trace has started to go ""off the deep end""),  ""Cold Case"" and re-runs of ""JAG"" on USA are the only shows I try to catch on a regular basis.",4,This was a QUALITY Television Series - It is Remembered Well,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,3990,"['remember', 'seeing', 'episode', 'Old', 'Engine', 'where', 'second', 'Engine', '51', 'Ward', 'La', 'France', 'delivered', 'first', 'run', 'where', 'Johnny', 'Roy', 'hop', 'back', 'new', 'engine', 'took', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'ran', 'first', 'call', 'engine', '1989', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'standing', 'up', 'house', 'imitating', 'Johnny', 'Roy', 'hopping', 'back', 'new', 'engine', 'volunteer', 'fire', 'department', 'was', 'had', 'two', 'Ward', 'La', 'France', 'just', 'like', 'Engine', '51', 'one', 'exception', 'were', 'white', 'instead', 'red', 'department', 'did', 'not', 'replace', 'two', 'engines', 'one', 'was', 'delivered', 'circa', '1971', 'other', '1974', '1993', '1994', 'worked', 'well', 'what', 'used', 'maintenance', 'captain', 'kept', 'up', 'good', 'miss', 'died', 'two', 'years', 'ago', '.Few', 'will', 'remember', 'Ward', 'La', 'France', 'donated', 'Engine', '51', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'series', 'ended', '1977', 'LACoFD', 'used', 'Station', '60', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'was', 'retired', 'elsewhere', 'was', 'driven', 'factory', 'Elmira', 'NY', 'Ward', 'La', 'France', 'now', 'closed', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'CA', 'A', 'crew', 'manned', 'Mike', 'Stoker', 'was', 'real', 'firefighter', 'who', 'drove', 'Engine', '51', 'show', 'Ed', 'McFall', 'Mike', 'Stearns', 'Mike', 'Ed', 'were', 'real', 'paramedics', 'early', 'days', 'had', 'John', 'Gage', 'been', 'real', 'would', 'been', 'Ed', 'Class', 'Mike', 'was', 'first', 'class', 'six', 'men', 'so', 'had', 'Desoto', 'been', 'real', 'would', 'been', 'Dick', 'Friend', 'Dick', 'was', 'Public', 'Information', 'officer', 'LaCoFD', 'passed', 'away', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'drove', 'Engine', 'arranged', 'make', 'frequent', 'stops', 'several', 'cities', 'do', 'demonstrations', 'shopping', 'centers', 'paramedic', 'program', 'Keep', 'mind', 'was', 'summer', '1973', 'few', 'spectators', 'were', 'do', 'real', 'guys', 'REALLY', 'do', 'street', 'just', 'TV', 'Yes', 'real', 'guys', 'REALLY', 'did', 'show', 'EMERGENCY', 'helped', 'spread', 'paramedic', 'concept.Like', 'many', 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'EMT', 'fire', 'captains', 'watched', 'Emergency', 'kid', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'few', 'firefighters', 'EMT', 'paramedics', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'age', 'bracket', '35-50', 'watched', 'Emergency', 'children', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'why', 'spent', '5', 'years', 'volunteer', 'fire', 'department', 'motivation', 'go', 'EMT', 'school', 'summer', '1987.As', 'watch', 'episodes', 'take', 'back', 'reminisce', 'fire', 'department', 'remembering', 'calls', 'are', 'similar', 'EMERGENCY', 'liked', 'Chet', 'reminded', 'old', 'Lieutenant', 'had', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'goof', 'when', 'bell', 'rang', 'got', 'serious', 'Captain', 'Stanley', 'often', 'two', 'fire', 'captains', 'who', 'had', 'direction', 'knowledge', 'was', 'always', 'helpful', 'captains', 'EMS', 'Lieutenant', 'maintenance', 'captain', 'looked', 'out', 'helped', 'trained', 'me.EMERGENCY', 'had', 'lot', 'authenticity', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'R.A.', 'Cinader', 'insisted', 'was', 'show', 'came', 'out', 'mid-1990', 'LA', 'Firefighters', 'where', 'LA', 'County', 'LA', 'City', 'representatives', 'said', 'LA', 'Firefighters', 'came', 'out', 'lasted', 'only', '6', 'episodes', 'Rescue', '77', 'also', 'had', 'short', 'run', 'something', '8', 'episodes', 'department', 'would', 'lend', 'there', 'name', 'TV', 'series', 'again', 'should', 'be', 'statement', 'quality', 'American', 'Television', 'today', 'Back', 'seventies', 'family', 'hour', 'was', 'reserved', 'Saturday', 'night', 'what', 'happened', 'Now', 'CBS', 'NBC', 'dedicate', 'Saturday', 'night', 'showing', 're-runs', 'other', 'shows', 'Law', 'Order', 'Cold', 'Case', 'Trace', 'one', ""CSI's.EMERGENCY"", 'set', 'good', 'example', 'standard', 'television', 'never', 'saw', 'Gage', 'going', 'bed', 'dates', 'talking', 'inappropiately', 'others', 'was', 'good', 'show', 'Saturday', 'night', 'family', 'hour', 'Hollywood', 'bring', 'quality', 'back', 'occasionally', 'watch', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'CSI', 'NY', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Miami', 'one', 'Trace', 'started', 'go', 'deep', 'end', 'Cold', 'Case', 're-runs', 'JAG', 'USA', 'are', 'only', 'try', 'catch', 'regular', 'basis']",Emergency!

I grew up on this show, and it still holds up well today.  In fact, Emergency was the groundbreaker that lead directly to E.R.I loved watching it again on TV Land, but was disappointed that they used the final season theme/credits for all episodes.  It may seem like a trivial thing, but I've always loved the theme song that they used from seasons 3-5.  I've been dying to hear that full theme song - with the Jazzy mid section - for over 20 years.  I'm still waiting.Universal chose not to put out the original versions of these episodes, instead using the versions given to TV Land.  Now, the episodes that I've seen so far appear to be full length, but I've only watched the first two and scanned through the rest.  (Update - it looks like just about all of the episodes are full length.)  The decision to go with the versions that have the wrong theme song/credits is perplexing, though.They dug deep and found the original versions from seasons 1 & 2, why couldn't they do the same with season 3?The picture and sound quality for the Season 3 Box Set is acceptable, but not as good as seasons 1 & 2 (both of which were flawed in authoring/mastering, but had good source material).  What happened?  A year wait and this is the best they can do?  I know these aren't the biggest sellers Universal has, but they're selling well enough to warrant releasing all seasons, so why not continue to do at least the same quality job that they did with seasons 1 & 2?  It makes no sense.The quality of the episodes of this classic show more than calls for the purchase of this box set, but it is a disappointing release, and I hope that Universal gets it right for Season 4!

1038373,AUGEFMPSU9Q19,B000LC4C60,"Frankly ""starshiptrooper1971""","[3, 4]","I'm a big Emergency fan, and clearly season three is where most shows start to click with chemistry and character, which happens here. Better scripts and plots are the norm. Season's one and two, I found myself FF between the dull or uninteresting parts. Season three is very viewable, and holds up well.The major fault is with some of the presentation itself. Example; one of my favorite episodes ""Inferno"" was either lost or not found for a clear transfer from the original film. In its place is a good print, probably taken from the syndication vaults, (which were edited with season 4 or 5 credits), (The hospital communication room doesn't exist yet, but appears in the opening credit roll). I'm not sure exactly what's up, or the story from the studio is, but I'd sumise to say that it's the best print available, or that could be found. It is better quality than VHS, cable or TV, but lesser that DVD is capable of presenting.With that, one example of a great print is 'Snakebite"" Colors are vibrant, squad and engine are ""fire engine red"", dialouge is original mono, spruced to Dolby Digital, clear, and in keeping with the original presentation.I love the original opening sequences, keeping the timeline of the show. All in all, I can remember at least four opening credit changes throughout the series.I should also note that some of the subtitles don't exactly match a scene. For instance, ""Chet"" was off scene having dialoge, and the caption read ""Marco"" talking, ""Squad 51"" somehow got tranposed to ""Squad 52"". I've never seen this many errors in one presentation. Then again, where were the script girls for some of these episodes? The continuity errors are always enjoyable (for me), and part of the shows charm.I still enjoy these episodes, and often look for actors in the background and their expressions. Love it when they throw Mike Stoker a line, and see if he fumbles. I also look to see when he's missing, knowing he was a real fireman on call, away from the show. It explains how he was technicaly able to pull off the engine scenes like that with the brush fire in ""Inferno"". The second Engine 51 appears in the season's second episode, and interesting to note it's still in service at Yosemite National Park, since 1987, (DNC Engine #7, license YCS-E51). How cool is that?You need to at least like the show to pick this one up, as it has some disappointing production values. I think this will be the best that can be done, other than Universal discovering the lost original film and doing a season reissue.Enjoy, KMG365",3,KMG365 For Emergency,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,2547,"[""'m"", 'big', 'Emergency', 'fan', 'clearly', 'season', 'three', 'where', 'most', 'shows', 'start', 'click', 'chemistry', 'character', 'here', 'Better', 'scripts', 'plots', 'are', 'norm', 'Season', 'one', 'two', 'found', 'FF', 'dull', 'uninteresting', 'parts', 'Season', 'three', 'very', 'viewable', 'up', 'well.The', 'major', 'fault', 'presentation', 'Example', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'Inferno', 'was', 'lost', 'not', 'found', 'clear', 'transfer', 'original', 'film', 'place', 'good', 'print', 'probably', 'taken', 'syndication', 'vaults', 'were', 'edited', 'season', '4', '5', 'credits', 'hospital', 'communication', 'room', ""n't"", 'exist', 'yet', 'opening', 'credit', 'roll', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'up', 'story', 'studio', ""'d"", 'sumise', 'say', 'best', 'print', 'available', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'better', 'quality', 'VHS', 'cable', 'TV', 'lesser', 'DVD', 'capable', 'presenting.With', 'one', 'example', 'great', 'print', ""'Snakebite"", 'Colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'squad', 'engine', 'are', 'fire', 'engine', 'red', 'dialouge', 'original', 'mono', 'spruced', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'clear', 'keeping', 'original', 'presentation.I', 'original', 'opening', 'sequences', 'keeping', 'timeline', 'show', 'can', 'remember', 'least', 'four', 'opening', 'credit', 'changes', 'series.I', 'should', 'also', 'note', 'subtitles', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'match', 'scene', 'instance', 'Chet', 'was', 'scene', 'having', 'dialoge', 'caption', 'read', 'Marco', 'talking', 'Squad', '51', 'somehow', 'got', 'tranposed', 'Squad', '52', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'many', 'errors', 'one', 'presentation', 'Then', 'again', 'where', 'were', 'script', 'girls', 'episodes', 'continuity', 'errors', 'are', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'part', 'shows', 'charm.I', 'still', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'often', 'look', 'actors', 'background', 'expressions', 'Love', 'when', 'throw', 'Mike', 'Stoker', 'line', 'see', 'also', 'look', 'see', 'when', 'missing', 'knowing', 'was', 'real', 'fireman', 'call', 'away', 'show', 'how', 'was', 'technicaly', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'engine', 'scenes', 'brush', 'fire', 'Inferno', 'second', 'Engine', '51', 'season', 'second', 'episode', 'interesting', 'note', 'still', 'service', 'Yosemite', 'National', 'Park', '1987', 'DNC', 'Engine', '7', 'license', 'YCS-E51', 'How', 'cool', 'need', 'least', 'show', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'disappointing', 'production', 'values', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'other', 'Universal', 'discovering', 'lost', 'original', 'film', 'doing', 'season', 'reissue.Enjoy', 'KMG365']",Emergency!

With Universal it's one step forward (Season 2) and two steps back with Season 3.  There is only one single redeeming point in favor of Season 3,; the change to single-sided DVD, but even then they are plain white instead of the standard practice of picture discs. :(  What kind of clowns are running this train-wreck of a company:(!Universal Studios has reduced ""Webb TV"" to the horrid release of Dragnet '67, a big collection of muddy garbage, then the half-baked, freeze-up, seize-up Adam 12 - Season 1 and Emergency - Season 1, another messy release with pixalated episodes.  I thought when Emergency - Season 2 came out with no problems with the exception of moronic double-sided discs our problems were at least being addressed by Universal Studios.  Apparently Universal Studios takes delight (and our money) in releasing much wanted media in such an uncommitted, irresponsible, tergiversating and reckless mindset!Universal Studios, you are a shameful embarrassment to American manufacturing standards.  Take an example from Paramount (whom btw corrected their problems with TAGS #4) and Image Entertainment.  Both these studios are producing above average to supurb TV season sets.Please halt the further desecreation of Jack Webb's legacy!  If you can't handle the job, please let someone who can.

Furthermore, what is one to do when they are WAITING to spend their money on other shows that Universal won't release (Adam-12 & Dragnet)!  ARGHHHHHH!While all three Emergency sets could have been put together much better, I still gave them a 5 star rating.  The content is worth it because Emergency is a true classic.  I was six years old in 1972 and I like the show just as much now as I did then.  John and Roy are the coolest.I thought that I would mention one thing.  In watching the first episodes in season one, you may perhaps get a bit confused.  The set starts out with a pilot movie that is actually very good, however, is probably a bit different than the Emergency you remember.  Then, the first few episodes are just plain ""goofy!""  As with any show, the characters develop and evolve in their own way.  These first episodes are very ""stiff"" and not very well produced.  Don't worry, by the end of season one you will be rushing out to buy season two and three.In season two, everything starts falling into place.  The show becomes more structured and the writing is MUCH better.  I have only watched 5 episodes from season three so far and absolutely love it.  At times, I have noticed that you find yourself much more interested in the personal interaction between the characters than you are the ""fire and rescue"" aspects of the show.

The show's pace, which occasionally lurched in seasons 1 and 2, had become smooth.I chuckled at some minor continuity gaps. Several times, a Ford ambulance picked up the victim at the scene, but a Chevy ambulance delivered the same victim to Rampart General. And in one episode, while showing Squad 51 rushing to the scene, they spliced in a clip of Squad 10 from the pilot episode -- that truck had entirely different styling.Sadly, the film is in rough shape in some of these episodes.  For example, in one episode just after the open, the film jumps and you hear a pop.  You can clearly see scratches and splice marks appear and quickly disappear in other episodes.  Moreover, in several episodes for some reason the open from the final season was spliced in, usually a little clumsily.  I don't understand why they did this when the proper season 3 open was available from so many other episodes.  I'm a stickler for accuracy, I guess.

It's ironic that two relatively unknown actors stole the show away from the more established stars.One of the great things about Emergency was the fact that it put EMS and paramedics into the consciousness of America. It, literally, changed the face of what emergency medicine was in this country and many others. That's quite a legacy for a series.

I keep telling myself, it's time to put the DVD away, only to find myself watching enough episode.The best one to me is ""The Waiting Hours,"" about Dr. Early's double bypass (not a routine operation back in the 70's.) The fear and worry on Dixie's face is real (after all, Bobby Troup was Julie London's real-life husband.) Once again, clam chowder plays a role in this Jack Webb show(both Dragnet and Adam-12 also had episodes that featured it.)Other highlights are ""Inferno"" and ""Fools"" (featuring Bobby Sherman as a cocky intern.) And who can forget Gage treating himself in the field after being bitten by a rattler in the brush? There's also the more lighthearted moments, like Chet besieging Gage with practical jokes. But even if the plot of the day sounds a bit silly, there's always one or two rescues that get the blood flowing (or the funny bone tickling.)People are complaining about the quality of the DVD's. Generally, I don't think it's so bad considering the age of the shows. However, there are a few episodes (the ones with the ""Season 6"" credits) that are poor quality, especially the one with the abusive mom. Interestingly, the DVD's seem to bring out things that weren't intended to be noticed in the 70's. For example, at a 5-alarm fire, you can tell that Engine 5 was really the old 51 engine (you can very clearly see the tape covering the 51.)

Guest stars rescued and treated by the regulars this season include a youthful Nick Nolte, Mariette Hartley, Happy Days' Donny Most, and '60s heartthrob Bobby Sherman.Unfortunately, as with previous EMERGENCY! DVD releases, there are no extras, though the episodes are spread across 5 single-sided discs rather than on double-sided discs. .Life goes on thanks to TV's life-saving paramedics team from Station 51 and the medical staff at Rampart Hospital in this complete 3rd Season collection on DVD. Includes Frequency&#34; (9/22/73), Computer Error&#34; (12/22/73), The Hard Hours&#34; (2/2/74) and 19 more for a total of 22 episodes on 5 DVDsIt's also nice to see this show complete & uncut & commercial-free as opposed to all those deleted scenes & added commercials you'd get when EMERGENCY was shown in reruns on ME-TV and TV Land.",4,LA County's Finest Paramedics,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,2089,"['More', 'medical', 'drama', 'firefighting', 'adventures', 'await', 'Emergency', 'fan', 'multi-disc', 'set', '22', 'episodes', 'action', 'series', '1973-74', 'Season.Story-wise', 'not', 'much', 'change', 'Rescue', 'Squad', '51', 'headquarters', 'housed', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'County', 'Firemen', 'Roy', 'DeSoto', 'Randolph', 'Mantooth', 'Johnny', 'Gage', 'Kevin', 'Tighe', 'Rampart', 'Hospital', 'home', 'Dr.', 'Kelley', 'Brackett', 'Robert', 'Fuller', 'Dr.', 'Bobby', 'Troup', 'Joe', 'Early', 'head', 'nurse', 'Dixie', 'McCall', 'Julie', 'London', 'Roy', 'must', 'decide', 'become', 'engineer', 'stay', 'paramedics', '34', 'Promotion', '34', 'Episode', '7', 'Troup', 'Dr.', 'Joe', 'Early', 'heart', 'condition', '34', 'Hard', 'Hours', '34', 'Episode', '19', '.But', 'story', 'arcs', 'character', 'change', 'was', ""n't"", 'fuel', 'drove', 'Emergency', 'was', 'rescues', 'naturally', 'are', 'plenty', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'motorcycle', 'gang', 'war', 'season', 'opener', '34', 'Frequency', '34', 'rocker', 'diabetic', 'coma', 'Episode', '4', '34', 'English', 'Visitor', '34', 'singer', 'who', 'heart', 'attack', 'Episode', '12', '34', 'Body', 'Language', '34', 'footballer', 'Dick', 'Butkus', 'who', 'tackled', 'too', 'roughly', 'own', 'son', '34', 'Hard', 'Hours', '34', 'magician', 'who', 'safe', 'Episode', '14', '34', 'Computer', 'Error', '34', 'Guest', 'stars', 'rescued', 'treated', 'regulars', 'season', 'include', 'youthful', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Mariette', 'Hartley', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Donny', 'Most', 'heartthrob', 'Bobby', 'Sherman.Unfortunately', 'previous', 'EMERGENCY', 'DVD', 'are', 'extras', 'episodes', 'are', 'spread', '5', 'single-sided', 'discs', 'rather', 'double-sided', 'discs', '.Life', 'thanks', 'TV', 'life-saving', 'paramedics', 'team', 'Station', '51', 'medical', 'staff', 'Rampart', 'Hospital', 'complete', '3rd', 'Season', 'collection', 'DVD', 'Includes', 'Frequency', '34', '9/22/73', 'Computer', 'Error', '34', '12/22/73', 'Hard', 'Hours', '34', '2/2/74', '19', 'more', 'total', '22', 'episodes', '5', 'DVDsIt', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'show', 'complete', 'uncut', 'commercial-free', 'opposed', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'added', 'commercials', ""'d"", 'get', 'when', 'EMERGENCY', 'was', 'shown', 'reruns', 'ME-TV', 'TV', 'Land']",Emergency!

You never know quite what to expect on Emergency, as the flexible format allows for a mixture of accidents, rescues, firefighting, and medical situations.  Some routine, some extremely dangerous, and some completely off the wall.  The writers do a pretty good job of coming up with interesting and exciting situations and blending them with everyday life.Paramedics are now a standard part of emergency services, but back then, the program was relatively new and evolving, and LA country's was one of the pioneers in the field.  The integration of paramedics into the fire department is at the heart of the series.  Paramedics John Gage (Randolph Mantooth) and Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) are regular firemen with specialized medical training, working at the frontlines in this new field.  Of all the characters, we know the most about this likeable pair, but there isn't that much down time for either the firemen or the Rampart staff to get too personal.  The horn will soon sound, sending the squad off on another emergency call.Season three has 22 episodes on five discs, including `The Hard Hours' where Dr. Joe Early (Bobby Troupe) faces his own medical crisis, `Fools' with Bobby Sherman as a cocksure physician new to the ER, `The Promotion' where Roy ponders taking a promotion that will force him to leave the paramedic program, and ""Frequency' where communications problems highlight a potential crisis",4,Solid third round . . .,1203206400,"02 17, 2008",2008,1538,"['third', 'season', 'Emergency', 'following', 'activities', 'LA', 'County', 'Fire', 'Station', '51', 'Rampart', 'General', 'Hospital', 'never', 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'expect', 'Emergency', 'flexible', 'format', 'mixture', 'accidents', 'rescues', 'firefighting', 'medical', 'situations', 'routine', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'completely', 'wall', 'writers', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'coming', 'up', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'situations', 'blending', 'everyday', 'life.Paramedics', 'are', 'now', 'standard', 'part', 'emergency', 'services', 'back', 'then', 'program', 'was', 'relatively', 'new', 'evolving', 'LA', 'country', 'was', 'one', 'pioneers', 'field', 'integration', 'paramedics', 'fire', 'department', 'heart', 'series', 'Paramedics', 'John', 'Gage', 'Randolph', 'Mantooth', 'Roy', 'DeSoto', 'Kevin', 'Tighe', 'are', 'regular', 'firemen', 'specialized', 'medical', 'training', 'working', 'frontlines', 'new', 'field', 'characters', 'know', 'most', 'likeable', 'pair', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'down', 'time', 'firemen', 'Rampart', 'staff', 'get', 'too', 'personal', 'horn', 'will', 'soon', 'sound', 'sending', 'squad', 'off', 'emergency', 'call.Season', 'three', '22', 'episodes', 'five', 'discs', 'including', 'Hard', 'Hours', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Joe', 'Early', 'Bobby', 'Troupe', 'own', 'medical', 'crisis', 'Fools', 'Bobby', 'Sherman', 'cocksure', 'physician', 'new', 'ER', 'Promotion', 'where', 'Roy', 'taking', 'promotion', 'will', 'force', 'leave', 'paramedic', 'program', 'Frequency', 'where', 'communications', 'problems', 'highlight', 'potential', 'crisis']",Emergency!
