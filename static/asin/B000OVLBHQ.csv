Wedding Wars takes a light hearted comedic approach to an all too controversial but relevant issue in today's society, the right for gay people to marry.  Very engaging and entertaining, the producers explain in the brief extras feature that the story is basically a fable, a true to life story with some implausible elements meant to carry a message of importance.  I never found the movie preachy and I loved the way all the main characters were presented, no major villains here, just real humans with some differences in their beliefs.  Though some may object to the lack of resolution of the issues at stake, the story does resolve the wedding at hand, kindly and gently, and leaves the audience with perhaps some new insights to reflect upon.",4,Must see,1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,823,"['was', 'wonderfully', 'surprised', 'quality', 'composition', 'story', 'Wedding', 'Wars', 'light', 'hearted', 'comedic', 'approach', 'too', 'controversial', 'relevant', 'issue', 'today', 'society', 'right', 'gay', 'people', 'marry', 'Very', 'engaging', 'entertaining', 'producers', 'explain', 'brief', 'extras', 'feature', 'story', 'basically', 'fable', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'implausible', 'elements', 'meant', 'carry', 'message', 'importance', 'never', 'found', 'movie', 'preachy', 'loved', 'way', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'presented', 'major', 'villains', 'here', 'just', 'real', 'humans', 'differences', 'beliefs', 'may', 'object', 'lack', 'resolution', 'issues', 'stake', 'story', 'resolve', 'wedding', 'hand', 'kindly', 'gently', 'audience', 'perhaps', 'new', 'insights', 'reflect', 'upon']",Wedding Wars

1066383,A1U11PS71ML0YJ,B000OVLBHQ,"Derrick Jenkins ""love of Gaming/Movies/Anime/...","[6, 7]","Loved this one it had a cool premise what if all the gays in all areas around the country went on strike.  How it affected the country was crazy and i know it wouldnt go down quite like that.  It was still nice to see people uniting over the issue of gay marriage and all that it entails.  John Stamos plays his character pretty well as well as Eric Dane.  His accepting (not really) of him being gay brother.  John Stamos is an all around delight to see in the movie being able to stand up for what he believes in.  When the issue of gay marriage gets put down by the governor that wasn't thinking that way before hand.  But it is an election year after all.The supporting characters particularly his live in partner and Eric Dane's wife are acted well and having them in this helps lighten the mood somewhat. Not that is needed because the governor's wife is none too pleased with him after his decision and lets him know on any occasion she can.  I love that and i love the fact that while this is about gays marrying its also about a brother finally seeing and accepting his brother for who he is a gay man that wants the same thing he has...to be married.  It ends while like a few other movies i've seen still feels somewhat unique and stands on its own merits.Loved the movie, storyline behind it and the overall appeal of each of the actors/actresses.  It is worth checking out and enjoying as well.  I bought and love it personally...with the recent string of gay movies that i've seen they've been too depressing and brooding. This has a message but it brings across that message through a mix of comedy and drama as well.Job well done to all.",5,Nicely done and entertains also,1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,1653,"['Loved', 'one', 'had', 'cool', 'premise', 'what', 'gays', 'areas', 'country', 'went', 'strike', 'How', 'affected', 'country', 'was', 'crazy', 'i', 'know', 'go', 'down', 'quite', 'was', 'still', 'nice', 'see', 'people', 'uniting', 'issue', 'gay', 'marriage', 'John', 'Stamos', 'character', 'pretty', 'well', 'as', 'well', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'accepting', 'not', 'really', 'being', 'gay', 'brother', 'John', 'Stamos', 'around', 'delight', 'see', 'movie', 'being', 'able', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'When', 'issue', 'gay', 'marriage', 'put', 'down', 'governor', 'was', ""n't"", 'thinking', 'way', 'hand', 'election', 'year', 'all.The', 'supporting', 'characters', 'particularly', 'live', 'partner', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'wife', 'are', 'acted', 'well', 'having', 'lighten', 'mood', 'somewhat', 'Not', 'needed', 'governor', 'wife', 'none', 'too', 'pleased', 'decision', 'know', 'occasion', 'can', 'love', 'i', 'love', 'fact', 'gays', 'marrying', 'also', 'brother', 'finally', 'seeing', 'accepting', 'brother', 'who', 'gay', 'man', 'same', 'thing', 'be', 'married', 'few', 'other', 'movies', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'still', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'own', 'merits.Loved', 'movie', 'storyline', 'overall', 'appeal', 'actors/actresses', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'enjoying', 'as', 'well', 'bought', 'love', 'personally', 'recent', 'string', 'gay', 'movies', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'been', 'too', 'depressing', 'brooding', 'message', 'message', 'mix', 'comedy', 'drama', 'well.Job', 'well', 'done']",Wedding Wars
1066384,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000OVLBHQ,Grady Harp,"[8, 8]","The added features on this very entertaining DVD of the brisk and light comedy WEDDING WARS bear watching: the producers, director and actors make the case for the approach of this quality film in tackling the issue of rights for gay marriage in a manner that could not offend anyone and at the same time create a more serious vantage from which to view the controversy. It is the only time in the 'film' that politics is the issue, a factor that makes the actual viewing of the story far more powerful. Credit the writer Stephen Mazur and director Jim Fall for a creating a frothy, fun story that has much more at its core than just entertainment.Ben Grandy (Eric Dane) works as the campaign manager for the Governor of Maine (James Brolin) and proposes to the governor's daughter Maggie (Bonnie Sommerville).  The wedding will be at the waterside mansion of the Governor and when the need for a wedding planner is raised, Maggie insists they ask Shel Grandy (John Stamos), the openly gay brother of Ben, who as a party planner has always dreamed of doing a wedding.  Shel is in a successful relationship with state prosecutor Ted (Sean Moore) who remains in the closet for career reasons.  Shel jumps at the chance to do the wedding, hoping that in some way this event will mend the schism with his big brother who has been distant since Shel informed him he was gay.  All goes well until Ben writes a speech for the Governor in which the Governor states he is against gay marriage.  Shel is stunned, gathers up his plans for the wedding and begins a private strike for gay marriage, a strike that with television and media coverage soon spreads across the entire USA, the result being the closure of beauty salons, florists, restaurants, limo services (and all the stereotype gay run businesses, unfortunately).  The crisis is ultimately resolved in a humorous yet very touching manner and to reveal more would diminish the impact for the viewer.John Stamos is superb as the radical Shel, but everyone in the cast is completely professional - James Brolin, Eric Dane, Bonnie Sommerville, Sean Maher, Claire Welling, Sean McCann, Jane Eastwood, Linda Kash, etc.The production qualities are polished, the story flows along at a fast clip, and in the end there are moments of truth that poignantly emphasize human rights to happiness for everyone. Would that there were more films of this caliber to deliver social comment without the preaching so often associated with message films.  It is a delight to watch.
