It was brutal and difficult to watch but knowing it was based on things that actually happenes within the military of all countries was disturbing but on the other hand, we should not think all military personnel are heroes. That such brutality was sanctioned by the higher echelon was most disturbing especially when these &#34;officers&#34; blamed everything on their subordinates. Not a movie for the squeamish.",3,Brutal,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,516,"['watched', 'only', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'was', 'too', 'briefly', 'was', 'brutal', 'difficult', 'watch', 'knowing', 'was', 'based', 'things', 'actually', 'military', 'countries', 'was', 'disturbing', 'other', 'hand', 'should', 'not', 'think', 'military', 'personnel', 'are', 'heroes', 'such', 'brutality', 'was', 'sanctioned', 'higher', 'echelon', 'was', 'most', 'disturbing', 'especially', 'when', '34', 'officers', '34', 'blamed', 'everything', 'subordinates', 'Not', 'movie', 'squeamish']",The Mark of Cain

The early scenes in Iraq on patrol with boredom and chaos are accurately done.But then the  quickly becomes filled with judgement, stereotyping of soldiers by those who likely don't know any personally, and agenda of the liberal anti-war bent.The underlying narrative the producers seek to enlighten us with their agenda, all easily summarized as:1) most soldiers are not too smart and most are tricked into war by cynical older men;2) most soldiers are just young cannon fodder who do no good;3) many if not most soldiers are brutal, sadistic and inhumane;4) war bends all people into animals and no war is ever worth fighting; and5) the title Mark of Cain is meant to imply soldiers are like Cain, the very first murder, all soldiers are murderers.There is little idealism or anything noble in the producer's world view and this storyline.I highly recommend you take a pass watching this movie unless you wish to be dispirited for no good reason.  The film is inaccurate and does a great disservice to all soldiers and Marines of all generations of every nation.",1,"Filled with Agenda, a Twisted View of Soldiers and the Iraq War",1386028800,"12 3, 2013",2013,1269,"['served', 'Iraq', 'US', 'Marine', 'had', 'privilege', 'serving', 'UK', 'Royal', 'Marine', 'Engineers.This', 'movie', 'likely', 'one', 'worst', 'renderings', 'conflict', 'have', 'had', 'displeasure', 'seeing', 'early', 'scenes', 'Iraq', 'patrol', 'boredom', 'chaos', 'are', 'accurately', 'done.But', 'then', 'quickly', 'filled', 'judgement', 'stereotyping', 'soldiers', 'who', 'likely', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'personally', 'agenda', 'liberal', 'anti-war', 'bent.The', 'underlying', 'narrative', 'producers', 'seek', 'enlighten', 'agenda', 'easily', 'summarized', 'as:1', 'most', 'soldiers', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'smart', 'most', 'are', 'tricked', 'war', 'cynical', 'older', 'men', '2', 'most', 'soldiers', 'are', 'just', 'young', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'who', 'do', 'good', '3', 'many', 'not', 'most', 'soldiers', 'are', 'brutal', 'sadistic', 'inhumane', '4', 'war', 'people', 'animals', 'war', 'ever', 'worth', 'fighting', 'and5', 'title', 'Mark', 'Cain', 'meant', 'imply', 'soldiers', 'are', 'Cain', 'very', 'first', 'murder', 'soldiers', 'are', 'little', 'idealism', 'anything', 'noble', 'producer', 'world', 'view', 'storyline.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'take', 'pass', 'watching', 'movie', 'wish', 'be', 'dispirited', 'good', 'reason', 'film', 'inaccurate', 'great', 'disservice', 'soldiers', 'Marines', 'generations', 'nation']",The Mark of Cain

If even a group-interrogation scene looks a bit concentrated, similarly toSaloactions, revelations of moral and general behavioral patterns might hardly question the UK movie-makers' personal acquaintance with native homeland environment presented by British cinematography more and more frequently and, perhaps, surprisingly honestly to an outer world.A suicide in a tube committed by a character played by G.

1183564,A3DLVCGO7SP253,B001DXD58C,Rextrent,"[1, 2]","Unfortunate that the audio is AWFUL and NO SUBTITLES. I understood very little of what was said, so I just watched the story as if I were mostly deaf. Typical English-speaking Americans will not decipher the words as spoken and anybody else, well, not unless you're from a certain neighborhood in England, good luck! For the story: it's portrayed ""without political bias"". Sadly though, it might come across as a historical account and basically a smear on the American & British efforts in Iraq. The story of this war effort is easily misconstrued. Today I will attend a service for a young soldier who gave his life in service to America and freedom-loving people. He is a good young man at peace with God today. He gave his life to save the lives of ""innocent"" Afghan civilians, because what is more important to many in America today is preserving enemy civilian shields instead of preserving American soldiers and their families. As with Japan in '45 we should be using massive bombing to achieve our ends over there but we're not. It's a hard debacle. Mark of Cain could have been better and seems like a first or second effort at film-making. There truly was an effort at non-partisanship and lack of bias.Where are the movies about the countless atrocities committed by Muslims against countless victims: innocent women and children, Christians, their own people in the name of Islam and the Koran? It's not a religion of peace after all.However, I highly recommend ""Combat Diary: The Marines of Lima Co.""",3,Fictional Effort to portray wartime atrocity,1288396800,"10 30, 2010",2010,1513,"['Unfortunate', 'audio', 'AWFUL', 'NO', 'SUBTITLES', 'understood', 'very', 'little', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'just', 'watched', 'story', 'were', 'mostly', 'deaf', 'Typical', 'English-speaking', 'Americans', 'will', 'not', 'decipher', 'words', 'spoken', 'anybody', 'else', 'well', 'not', ""'re"", 'certain', 'neighborhood', 'England', 'good', 'luck', 'story', 'portrayed', 'political', 'bias', 'Sadly', 'might', 'come', 'historical', 'account', 'basically', 'smear', 'American', 'British', 'efforts', 'Iraq', 'story', 'war', 'effort', 'easily', 'misconstrued', 'Today', 'will', 'attend', 'service', 'young', 'soldier', 'who', 'gave', 'life', 'service', 'America', 'freedom-loving', 'people', 'good', 'young', 'man', 'peace', 'God', 'today', 'gave', 'life', 'save', 'lives', 'innocent', 'Afghan', 'civilians', 'what', 'more', 'important', 'many', 'America', 'today', 'preserving', 'enemy', 'civilian', 'shields', 'instead', 'preserving', 'American', 'soldiers', 'families', 'Japan', ""'45"", 'should', 'be', 'using', 'massive', 'bombing', 'achieve', 'ends', 'there', ""'re"", 'not', 'hard', 'debacle', 'Mark', 'Cain', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'first', 'second', 'effort', 'film-making', 'truly', 'was', 'effort', 'non-partisanship', 'lack', 'bias.Where', 'are', 'movies', 'countless', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'Muslims', 'countless', 'victims', 'innocent', 'women', 'children', 'Christians', 'own', 'people', 'name', 'Islam', 'Koran', 'not', 'religion', 'peace', 'all.However', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Combat', 'Diary', 'Marines', 'Lima', 'Co']",The Mark of Cain
