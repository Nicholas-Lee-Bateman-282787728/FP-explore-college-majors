It's really a story about a couple coming to terms with how G-d responds to our deepest needs and desires. Moshe and Malli are a childless married couple who are going through a particularly challenging time in their lives. Through their prayers they receive the miracles they are seeking however, these same miracles bring new challenges that continue to test their faith in God and ultimately in each other. I found myself laughing, crying and sitting at the edge of my seat all through the film.

970674,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000E8QVAQ,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[95, 99]","Few films have touched me as deeply as ""Ushpizin,"" the story of Moshe and Mali Bellanga, their trusting in miracles, and their recognition of the tests God has placed in their path. They sometimes fail the tests, but they are always aware that God is in their midst, and they listen for His voice. The fervor of Moshe and Mali's prayers bring about a miracle, and also a great challenge, in the form of a friend of Moshe's ""from the old days,"" and his companion, both escaped convicts.  The plot takes place during the 7 day Harvest Festival of Succoth, and some of it is quite humorous, but every scene is imbued with an insight into humanity, and man's connection to his Creator.Writer Shuli Rand stars as Moshe, with his real-life wife, Michal Bat-Sheva Rand as Mali; both are superb, with an intensity and truth in their characters that makes them totally believable, and an inner and outer beauty that captivates. Shot on location in the Mea Sherim quarter in Jerusalem, director Giddi Dar gives us marvelous details and performances from the actors in every scene. Shaul Mizrahi and Ilan Ganani are terrific as the 2 convicts, and so is Avraham Abutboul as Ben Baruch, the man who means well, but causes trouble, and won't leave until he is forgiven with a hug. The theme of forgiveness and repentance runs through the film, as well as God's great mercy.Though this film will perhaps have a limited audience, those who will love it are anyone with familiarity and respect for Orthodox Judaism, and anyone who has a very personal relationship with his God. There are those who think the Orthodox Jew who speaks to God as though He is their most precious friend is a little ""odd,"" and then there are those who speed down the freeway like a lemming with a cellphone stuck in their ear, and think they are ""normal."" Well, it takes all kinds to populate this crazy planet, and may the Moshes and Malis of the world prosper and bear much fruit.",5,"""There's only God.

970675,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B000E8QVAQ,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[3, 3]","I truly enjoyed this touching tale of Guests (""Ushpizin""), as Moshe Bellanga (Shuli Rand) and his wife Mali (Michal Bat-Sheva Rand) trust in God and their faith to bring them a miracle or two in time for Succah. During this autumn Harvest festival the Jewish people celebrate their redemption from bondage, 40 years of desert wandering and the fruits (real and spiritual alike) provided to them upon their settlement of the land of Israel.Moshe is, as the story unfolds, a very religious man, envious of those who can afford to buy the perfect Etrog. This citron is a tree-born fruit with which religious Jews bless the harvest, joined with the Lulav --- a palm frond joined with small gatherings of willow and myrtle branches to represent the spine, eyes and heart --- which allow us to appreciate God's bounty.And indeed a miracle arrives, which enables Moshe to celebrate Succah in style --- even though he has also unknowingly committed a sin in taking a Succah from another man, which a friend had falsely advised him to have been abandoned.But along with the miracle comes a series of burdens, all of them surrounding the unwelcome arrival of a criminal former friend, whose past experiences with Moshe he is most anxious to hide from his wife and neighbors.Moshe and Mali pray mostly for private miracles, which I think probably misrepresents the spirit of prayer offered by the vast majority of Orthodox Jews. It's doubtful that religious Israelis talk to God in the intimate and familiar manner of these two chief characters.Nevertheless there is something astonishingly endearing about them, and the film is sure to warm hearts, even of those who are not Orthodox, not even Jewish and not particularly religious.--Alyssa A.

970677,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B000E8QVAQ,Anyechka,"[7, 7]","I'd heard a lot of good things about this film, and wasn't disappointed.  And it's quite a refreshing change to actually see a film wherein the Hassidic/Hareidi characters are portrayed in a sensitive balanced realistic way, instead of like one-dimensional cardboard cutouts, bigoted sexist Medieval fanatics, fodder for a bunch of cheap ""jokes,"" or doing things that anyone who's familiar with their culture and theology knows they just don't do (such as the offensive and massively inaccurate depictions of Hareidi life in 'A Price Above Rubies' and 'Kadosh').  The interplay between the husband and wife is made even more effective knowing that they're married in real life; the actor, Shuli Rand, returned to acting after becoming frum just to make this film, and on the condition that his real-life wife Michal Bat-Sheva be his screen wife, since to act with any other woman would be to violate the laws of negiyah (touch) and yichud (being alone in a closed area).  For a first-time acting role, Mrs. Rand is incredibly convincing, as though she were a professional actor.  All of the other major Hareidi roles were also played by people who are observant in real-life, giving the picture even more of a feeling of authenticity.The week-long festival of Sukkot is coming up, but Moshe and Malka (Mali) Belanga, who are ba'alei teshuvah (newly-observant people), are so hard up for money that they're looking at the very real possibility of not being able to afford anything for the holiday--the four species (etrog [citron], lulav [date palm], aravah [willow], and hadas [myrtle]), a sukkah (the temporary booth which one lives in during much of the holiday), or even food to prepare festive meals.  All they have are their faith and their love, but even those things are being sorely tested by their poverty, particularly because they've been married nearly five years and yet are still childless.  However, a series of miracles occur that enable them to enjoy the holiday properly, and they feel that perhaps things are finally looking up for them, until a friend from Moshe's far-from-frum past shows up, along with a friend of his whom Moshe doesn't know.  When both of these men, escaped convicts, show up at the Belangas' sukkah, they can't be turned away because of the tradition of hospitality and because of the importance of having guests (ushpizin) in one's sukkah, but their presence quickly turns a happy holiday into a very tense stressful difficult time.  The miracles that enabled Moshe and Mali to have a happy holiday also start to seem more like curses in disguise as the holiday wears on.  They also have to deal with personal issues that are exacerbated by these outside forces, and along the way all of the main characters have to confront their own demons and learn some important lessons about things like pride, faith, love, hospitality, tolerance, and acceptance.As fine as the film is, though, I thought it could have afforded to go on maybe another 10 or 15 minutes.  While I did love the ending, it seemed as though the story was wrapped up a bit too neatly and quickly.  There were a couple of plot points that weren't really resolved.  Overall, though, it's a very moving and balanced portrayal of Hareidi life in Jerusalem, showing the viewer that these people, apart from some surface differences, aren't really too different from people in the outside world.  They have the same hopes, dreams, and fears, such as money difficulties and love for their spouses, and there are many people like the helpful well-meaning Ben Baruch, the wise old rabbi who is a lot more understanding and non-condemnatory than some other people in the neighborhood, and the enthusiastically pious Mali.

Erland,"[5, 5]","Note: Hebrew with English subtitles.Synopsis: The '04 Israeli film `Ushpizin' (meaning ""Guest"") takes place in a Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in the holy city of Jerusalem. As the story unfolds we discover that things are not going well for the main characters Moshe (Shuli Rand) and his wife Mali (Michal Bat-Sheva Rand). Succah is only a day away and they have no money to properly prepare for the religious celebration. When an unexpected financial blessing occurs after much soul searching and prayer they are convinced that surely a miracle has taken place. However when two unexpected guests appear and begin to cause problems the spirit of holiness begins to dissolve. Soon Moshe and Mali begin to doubt God's blessing and wonder what the Almighty has in mind.Critique: `Ushpizin' is one of the rare films that succeed in not only entertaining but also instructing. At first the audience will expect a comedy largely due to the fact that Shuli Rand looks exactly like Tevye from `Fiddler on the Roof.' However that initial expectation soon disappears and a serious drama unfolds as the two main characters grabble with the situation at hand, their own personal problems and the Jewish concepts of hospitality, anger, forgiveness and the temporal nature of life.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[1, 1]","""Ushpizin"" was directed by Giddi Par and written by Shuli Rand, who plays Moshe, a Chasid so impoverished that he lacks enough money to pay rent, much less purchase the necessities for the impending festival of Sukkot.  Michal Bat-Sheva is Malli, Moshe's sweet and long-suffering spouse.  This charming story is set in Jerusalem, among the tightly-knit world of the Breslover Chasidim, of whom Moshe is a member.  Right before the holiday, two amazing events transpire.  One thousand American dollars are slipped under Moshe and Malli's door.  In addition, someone unexpectedly gives Moshe a Sukkah that has apparently been abandoned.  If only Malli and Moshe could have the baby they long for, their happiness would be complete.Malli and Moshe face an unexpected challenge when Sukkot arrives.  Two escaped convicts, one of whom knew Moshe during the bad old days before he became a Chasid, drop in and make themselves at home.  They eat like vultures, drink copious amounts of liquor, and show no signs of departing.  Are these men shnorrers (Yiddish for people who habitually take advantage of the generosity of others; parasites) who should be given a swift kick and sent on their way?  Or is the Almighty testing Moshe and Malli to see if they will welcome these ""ushpizin"" (guests) with open arms, no matter how unsavory they appear?This is a hilarious and heartwarming film that is wonderfully acted by a terrific cast.  Both Shuli Rand and his real-life wife are tremendously appealing as devout Jews who pray with a full heart and love one another unreservedly.  They do argue however, especially when Moshe spends three hundred shekels on a glorious esrog (used during the Sukkot rituals), an expenditure that he may soon regret.  Shaul Mizrahi and Ilan Ganani are pitch-perfect as two rapscallions who worm their way into Moshe's household and stick to their hapless hosts like leeches.

The couple who are the center of focus are what are referred to in Israelas ""Hozrim b'teshuva"", i.e. people who came from a non-religiously observant life and who have adopted a haredi religious life, in the style of the Breslov Hasidim.  This group, unlike others, attracts a large number of people from non-religious backgrounds, and this is reflected in the manner of speech we hear in the film.  Their conversations are filled with modern Israeli expressions and slang (I have lived in Israel for over 20 years, but I needed to have my children explain to me what a lot of the slang expressions meant!).  We would not hear this from other Haredi Jews who were born and raised in this environment where effort is made to prevent the intrusion of the culture and mannerisms of the outside, ""secular"" world which the newly religious still have.  Also, we see a lot of emphasis on the value of ""simple faith"", prayer and intense analysis of the day's events in the light of one's own personal performance of mitzvot or commission of sins, as opposed to viewing one's life as being being buffeted largely by outside pressures and events.  Other streams of Haredi and non-Haredi Orthodox Judaism, such as the non-Hasidic ""Lithuanian"" yeshiva world, take a more intellectual approach to life in which great emphasis is laid on the study of the classic sources of Judaism, i.e. Bible, Talmud, Midrashim and Jewish philosophy.  Similarly, the people involved in this film take a passive approach to life, whereas other religious, Orthodox Jews (i.e. the ""Torani"" Religious Zionist stream) havetaken a much more activist approach towards fulfilling the mitzvah of settling and developing the Land of Israel while maintaining just as intense a religious lifestyle as the people portrayed in the film.Having said all this, the film is a masterpiece, both from the technical point of view (directing, camera work, lighting, acting) which shows that Israeli filmmakers can take their place with the best in the world, and also because the film refuses to make traditional Jews a caricature or stereotyped, which so many films do (I also recommend those who enjoyed this film to see the film ""The Chosen"" for a realisitic view ofOrthodox Judaism in New York around the time of the Second World War).",5,Wonderful Film-But Don't Extrapolate Too Much From It,1160524800,"10 11, 2006",2006,2556,"['film', 'wonderful', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'traditional', 'Judaism', 'important', 'keep', 'mind', 'film', 'particular', 'family', 'environment', 'not', 'necessarily', 'typical', 'what', 'called', 'Haredi', 'Ultra-Orthodox', 'Judaism', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'center', 'focus', 'are', 'are', 'referred', 'Israelas', 'Hozrim', ""b'teshuva"", 'i.e', 'people', 'who', 'came', 'non-religiously', 'observant', 'life', 'who', 'have', 'adopted', 'haredi', 'religious', 'life', 'style', 'Breslov', 'Hasidim', 'group', 'others', 'large', 'number', 'people', 'non-religious', 'backgrounds', 'reflected', 'manner', 'speech', 'hear', 'film', 'conversations', 'are', 'filled', 'modern', 'Israeli', 'expressions', 'slang', 'have', 'lived', 'Israel', '20', 'years', 'needed', 'have', 'children', 'explain', 'what', 'lot', 'slang', 'expressions', 'meant', 'would', 'not', 'hear', 'other', 'Haredi', 'Jews', 'who', 'were', 'born', 'raised', 'environment', 'where', 'effort', 'made', 'prevent', 'intrusion', 'culture', 'mannerisms', 'outside', 'secular', 'world', 'newly', 'religious', 'still', 'have', 'Also', 'see', 'lot', 'emphasis', 'value', 'simple', 'faith', 'prayer', 'intense', 'analysis', 'day', 'events', 'light', 'one', 'own', 'personal', 'performance', 'mitzvot', 'commission', 'sins', 'opposed', 'viewing', 'one', 'life', 'being', 'being', 'buffeted', 'largely', 'outside', 'pressures', 'events', 'Other', 'streams', 'Haredi', 'non-Haredi', 'Orthodox', 'Judaism', 'such', 'non-Hasidic', 'Lithuanian', 'yeshiva', 'world', 'take', 'more', 'intellectual', 'approach', 'life', 'great', 'emphasis', 'laid', 'study', 'classic', 'sources', 'Judaism', 'i.e', 'Bible', 'Talmud', 'Midrashim', 'Jewish', 'philosophy', 'Similarly', 'people', 'involved', 'film', 'take', 'passive', 'approach', 'life', 'other', 'religious', 'Orthodox', 'Jews', 'i.e', 'Torani', 'Religious', 'Zionist', 'stream', 'much', 'more', 'activist', 'approach', 'towards', 'fulfilling', 'mitzvah', 'settling', 'developing', 'Land', 'Israel', 'maintaining', 'just', 'intense', 'religious', 'lifestyle', 'people', 'portrayed', 'film.Having', 'said', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'technical', 'point', 'view', 'directing', 'camera', 'work', 'lighting', 'acting', 'Israeli', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'best', 'world', 'also', 'film', 'make', 'traditional', 'Jews', 'caricature', 'stereotyped', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'do', 'also', 'recommend', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'see', 'film', 'Chosen', 'realisitic', 'view', 'ofOrthodox', 'Judaism', 'New', 'York', 'time', 'Second', 'World', 'War']",N/A

The story may be simple but to non-orthodox Jews it is one at times confusing but always fascinating in introducing cultural traditions that are unknown to many of us.In the case of USHPIZIN that tradition is Succoth, a seven-day holiday honoring the time when the wandering Israelites were surviving in the desert on the way to the Holy Land. Each family must make a succah (a meager temporary shelter) and celebrate with Palm frond dates, myrtle, citron, etc.  We are introduced to Rabbi Moshe (Shuli Rand) and his wife Malli (Michal Bat Sheva Rand) who are so poor they cannot afford a succah much less the accoutrements  to celebrate Succoth. The both pray for miracles and one comes in the form of cash allowing them a succah etc.  But also along come two escaped convicts (Shaul Mizrahi and Ilan Ganani) - one of whom is Moshe's ex-friend from the past, and ask for shelter: the tradition of Succoth includes never turning away guests ('ushzipin').  Naturally Moshe and Malli must take them in and the problems slowly arise, problems that challenge tradition, religion, and personal welfare.The marriage of music, fine camera work, superb acting, beautiful costume design, and the magic of learning about ethnic traditions make this little film irresistible.

Take an Ultra-Orthodox Jewish couple trying to ""live for God"" in Old Jerusalem and then have them confronted with escaped convicts that serve to reveal the dark past of the husband's life.Throw in the Ultra religious community around them during a 7 day Holy Day Season,the intense pressure the wife feels for bearing a ""manchild"",lots of customs and lots of real suspicion and anger at God....and well....whoda thunk it??USHPIZIN (Guests) is a marvelous character study concerning Moshe and Malli Bellanga, late converts to Ultra Orthodoxy in Jerusalem.They try to see everything as coming from ""The Divine Hand"" as they, like many in other religions,seek to obey the countless laws,rituals,ceremonies and Holy Days that are involved.They have no money,no children,no luck....and enters a former ""blast from the past"" into Moshe's life in the form of escaped convicts Eliyahu and Yossef.Are these two sent from God as ""ushpizin"" to be entertained so that Heavenly and Earthly rewards can be reaped by Moshe and Malli; or are these ""guests"" sent as  a test sent to test their devotion to God?USHPIZIN is an eye opening look at one couple's struggle to ""live"" their beliefs.This film is often humorous and at times egdily frightening.This film is perfect for anyone, religious or not, because it really has to do with one fact: even if we turn to God (or even turn over a new leaf) do we ever truly escape the past? Actors Shuli Rand as Moshe and Michal Bat-Sheva Rand as wife Malli are revelatory in their performances;sensitive,compassionate,explosive,childish...and extremely REAL.Director of photography Amit Yasur knows how to film the closeup,so important to this film's feel.It clocks in at a brisk 92 minutes and is in Hebrew with very readable and slow-staying subtitles.This film is pure delight!USHPIZIN was Israel's 2004 Film Best Picture.",5,An Orthodox Jewish Thriller???

970705,A2VWQXWF1GO2ZE,B000E8QVAQ,Noam Eitan,"[2, 2]","This is a comment on and an addendum to Rabbi Yonassan Gershom's review of this film from June 16, 2010. Since my ""comment"" is so long I preferred to post it as a separate review, but you should read Rabbi Yonassan Gershom's review first.This movie touched me deeply; it's so rare to find a movie that takes religion on its own terms and can tell a story well. Thank you Rabbi Gershom for your edifying comments. I'd like to expand (further) on the cultural context of the characters depicted in it. Moshe and Mali Bellanga are not ""FFB"" (Frum [pious] From Birth), i.e., they were not conceived, born, and raised into families that were already pious and religiously observant. They are baalei teshuva, ""masters of repentance/ return"", i.e., Jews from a secular background who turn to embrace Orthodox Judaism (""return"" to the way of their ancestors). These people are welcome in the various ultra-orthodox sects/communities up to a point; they are actually marginalized by these communities. They very rarely marry into FFB families and are usually even poorer than the mostly poor FFB. The Breslov Hasidim have attracted large numbers of baalei teshuva since the 70's. Since the Breslov Hasidim themselves are considered a little out there, ""crazy"" as the Rabbi notes, and have a relatively flexible outlook on life, they have weathered strong opposition from virtually all other Hasidic movements and the wider ultra-orthodox communities since the 19th century. That makes them more attractive for baalei teshuva, as well as easier to integrate into - up to a point. The Breslov Hasidim are of course originally an Ashkenazi, European Jewish sect, but the movie depicts Moshe and Mali Bellanga as well as their 2 guests as being of Sephardi, North African ancestry and of secular, modern Israeli backgrounds. Mali cooks North African dishes, not a gefilte fish or kugel with pickles in sight. The guests specifically mention Middle Eastern/ North African spices in the food (and put lemon in the salad) and all four use North African slang (Arabic words). So Moshe and Mali Bellanga have not ""returned"" to the ways of their North African ancestors but to those of their Ashkenazi cousins. This is not uncommon in Israel. I spent a year and several summers as a baal teshuva in the Ashkenazi ""Or Same'akh"" Yeshiva in Jerusalem in the 70's. The services were conducted in the Ashkenazi tradition despite the large contingent of Sephardi students, who occasionally tried to revolt and conduct services from a Sephardic siddur (prayer book). The Ashkenazi Rabbis quickly quenched these revolts - they considered Sephardi to be second rate. I had a Sephardi roommate (the other roommate was a German protestant new convert to Judaism) who somehow replaced the cover page of his Ashkenazi siddur with a Sephardi one so that when he visits home his parents wouldn't find out that he defected to the other camp.The big confrontation scene with the mangal (a small portable grill in both Hebrew and Russian, probably derived from Turkish) has a strong ethnic tension subtext. The guests make a ruckus outside the sukkah booth, doing mangal grilling right in the center of the courtyard with ""their"" music blaring. Managal BBQ grilling is practiced mainly by poorer Middle Eastern/North African Jews and is pooh-poohed by well-off European Jews as unseemly and associated with bad manners in public. It's unheard of in the community that is the subject of this film, and it's quite odd that the Bellangas even own a mangal. From an Ashkenazi perspective, both secular and orthodox, the Middle Eastern aspect of park behavior (poor manners, loud music, fresserei, ""immodesty"" in public) is epitomized by the mangal. The guests are not only mocking Moshe's religion by wearing his streimel while grilling; they are engaging in a serious provocation that rubs in the issue to which community and set of customs their hosts really belong to.Bottom line: Moshe and Mali Bellanga are poorer than their poor neighbors and somewhat marginalized in their community. That is because they are different from the wider ultra-orthodox FFB community in several important ways. Being baalei teshuva, they speak in a Modern Israeli Hebrew dialect unlike their wider community. One of the most difficult obstacles for movies that try to describe life in these communities is the language barrier. Israelis speak a variant of Sephardic Hebrew (out of the hostility that the founders of the secular Israeli community and later state felt towards anything that reminded them of ""bourgeois"" orthodox Judaism and the old ways. There are other explanations but I believe this is the main reason.) The Ashkenazi ultra-orthodox community speaks Yiddish, and when they speak Hebrew it's in the Ashkenazi pronunciation, like the one Rabbi Yonassan (Yonatan in Sephardi pronunciation) Gershom uses in his review (the term ""hisboddidus"" he mentions would be hitbodedut in Sephardi pronunciation. Briefly, the Ashkenazi pronunciation voices T as S, a long A as O and O as OY). A small sect also speaks old Hungarian, an otherwise dead language. It's very difficult to assemble a cast who speak Yiddish, let alone a living, lively authentic Yiddish. You can teach them to talk in the Ashkenazi pronunciation, but the main target public of these movies is modern Israelis. Israelis are used to watching movies with subtitles, which most would need to follow Yiddish or the Ashkenazi pronunciation, but they would not sit through an entire movie in Yiddish, let alone in Ashkenazi Hebrew. An average Israeli movie going audience has a certain level of allergy to Yiddish outside of very specific contexts (like jokes or funerals), and Ashkenazi Hebrew sounds quite off-putting to them, even disgusting (it sounds retarded, too many ""oys"" and ""s"" sounds.)Moshe and Mali Bellanga are also different from the rest of the wider community that surrounds them in the way they interact with each other. They interact like people who did not grow up in a community where men and women are segregated from birth. It doesn't matter how much a FFB couple love each other, they would never interact like Moshe and Mali. It's a very subtle point, that is very obvious to anyone who spent time around these people (the FFB), but it's difficult to explain or describe. The body language is different. The Talmud says that women are ""a different nation"" or something to that effect. There is more distance and an old world sense of respect between FFB couples. FFB men do not grow up exposed to the opposite sex as much as a modern man; they approach women as exotic and potentially dangerous creatures that have to be handled very carefully, partly according to a very complicated set of rules, but these rules are not enough. You can see that in the movie when the Rabbi advises Moshe repeatedly about the importance of keeping his wife happy. Mali is also way too assertive for a Hassidic woman (they are relatively wallflowers). So the characters in this movie are authentic, but only in relation to a subset of a subset of a subset of the Hassidic community, which is itself a subset of etc.But the themes are universal, and as in any good story, the more specific the context the stronger the universal themes come out. There is one theme that is hidden in this story. A lot of viewers would not agree with me on this, particularly ultra-orthodox ones. This is relating to the ultra precious and physically and spiritually perfect etrog/esrog (the lemon-like fruit, translated ""citron"" in the subtitles). On a deeper spiritual and even mystical level the etrog had to be sacrificed for the couple to have their wish to conceive fulfilled.The last time I saw Shuli Rand was in Israel, in 1991, in Rina Yerushalmi's Hamlet. She brought it to BAM in 1992 in Hebrew retranslated into English over headsets, as part of a festival entitled ""Israel: the Next Generation."" Rina Yerushalmi staged the play around Shuli Rand and that performance, which was received with great critical and popular acclaim at the time was seared into my psyche. Fast-forward to last night, when I watched the movie, and realized it's HIM; I googled him and found out what has happened in the intervening years. That this movie has won no awards outside Israel is a testament to the politics of movie festivals and awards.",5,a comment on Rabbi Yonassan Gershom's review,1324857600,"12 26,

970706,A3QGRSZ7VTV0SY,B000E8QVAQ,Rabbi Yonassan Gershom,"[17, 17]","This is one of the few films that portray Haredi Jews (Hasidic, actually -- there is a difference, and I'll get to that in a minute) in a sensitive, positive way.  Perhaps that is because it was filmed on location in the Mea Shearim district of Jerusalem, and was made by real Orthodox Jews, in collaboration with secular filmmakers, giving it a level of authenticity that Hollywood ""outsiders"" have never achieved in their films about religious Jews.  It won several awards in Israel, and they are well-deserved.  But because it is an Israeli film (Hebrew with subtitles), it assumes a certain level of cultural knowledge that, judging from some of the reviews here, the average non-Jew does not have.  (This is NOT a put-down.  I imagine that if I were to watch a similar film about Christians, there would be plenty of cues I would fail to pick up.  We all need a tour guide sometimes.)Plenty of reviewers here have already summarized the plot, analyzed the acting, directing, etc., so I'm going to add something different to the discussion, namely, some cultural background for the uninitiated.  Although all Orthodox Jews may look alike to outsiders, there are, in fact, major differences among the various groups.  The first major division is between Hasidim -- the mystical branch -- and Haredim, the non-mystical branch.  Although some people use the word ""Haredi"" as a generic for ""Ultra-Orthodox"" (a media buzzword I hate), the Hasidim do not generally call themselves Haredim. The word ""Haredi"" doesn't even appear in the film, but the name of Moshe and Mali's specific Hasidic group -- Breslov -- does.  Several times.  This is an important cultural detail.  The kind of simple praying to God from the heart that you see in the film is a specificially Breslov practice, called in Hebrew ""hisboddidus,"" from the verb ""hisbaded"" which mean ""to make yourself be alone,"" that is, in solitude.  Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, founder of the Breslov branch of Hasidic Judaism in the late 1700s, encouraged his followers to spend at least an hour per day alone with God, praying in one's own language (In addition to the liturgical synagogue prayers.)So when Malli tells Moshe to ""go pray"" in the film, it is not just generic prayer, it is this specific practice of talking out loud to God -- even screaming out one's needs and frustration at the top of one's lungs -- as Moshe does.  Knowing this helps the scene make more sense.  We should also note here that the part of this scene where he sees a truckload of Jews dancing through the streets is also Breslov, although from a specific subgroup.  They would be followers of the late Rabbi Yisroel Ber Odesser, who taught his followers to chant a certain Hebrew mantra, the ""Na Nach Nachma,"" in the streets -- a familiar sight in Israel.  (You don't hear the mantra in the film, but it is written all over the truck.)  So when Moshe looks and sees them joyfully dancing but then turns away, we know the depths of his sorrow.Similarly, the scene where Moshe runs off into the woods and begs God to help him not to be angry is also very Breslov.  Rebbe Nachman taught that hisboddidus should ideally be done in a field or forest, because, he said, God's creation will join in the prayers.  (He was very fond ofPerek Shirah, a classical text about how each thing in creation sings a special song to God.] The vast majority of Orthodox Jews do not pray alone in the woods like that, and historically Breslovers have been considered odd -- if not crazy -- to do so.  In fact, Breslovers in general are considered somewhat strange, even by other Orthodox - and you get a hint of this in the scene where the philanthropist randomly chooses a number on a list to give away the money -- and sort of rolls his eyes when he sees the luck has fallen to a Breslover.About the fur hat:  The streimel (as it is called) is a traditional hat, specifically Hasidic (non-Hasidic Orthodox do not wear it)worn on Sabbaths and holidays.  One is not (as some negative reviewers here have wrongly assumed) REQUIRED to wear it -- but having a nice streimel is a status symbol, rather like having a new Ferrari -- only Moshe's is a rather beat-up second hand one, like, I suppose, a used VW Bug.  The purpose of that scene is to A) reinforce that Moshe is poor and B) emphasize the materialistic outlook of the two secular guests, who see only dollar signs.  We also understand, in the later scene where the guests make a ruckus outside the sukkah booth, that by wearing Moshe's streimel in such a way, they are mocking him and his religion.Now for the sukkah booth and the esrog (lemon-like fruit, translated ""citron"" in the subtitles.)  There is a general principle in Judaism that you cannot fulfill a mitzvah (commandment) with stolen money or property.  This is why, when Moshe discovers that the owner of the sukkah had not really abandoned it, Moshe feels he must track the owner down, get his forgiveness, and be absolved of any wrongdoing.  Otherwise, the stolen sukkah will pollute his efforts to celebrate the holiday of Sukkot (The ""Feast of Booths"" - see Leviticus 23:42).  As for the esrog, this is the ""fruit of goodly trees"" that, along with a palm spike, willows and myrtles, make up the ""Four Species"" mentioned in Leviticus 23:40, that are waved in the six directions on the Festival of Sukkot.Moshe buys the very best esrog he can find (and there is a certain humor in seeing the etrog-sellers examine each fruit with a jeweler's loup!) because of an ancient belief that a beautiful esrog is a segulah (charm, amulet, blessing) for having a son (which he and his wife Malli very much want, they are childless.)  Now, you might consider this superstitious, and maybe it is -- but I would ask you to look at all the non-Jewish customs that are also ""superstitious"" and put this in the same cultural context - as two people of simple faith hoping for a miracle.  For the purpose of the plot, the esrog is very important.  It becomes the ultimate test for Moshe when his two secular guests mistakenly cut it up for a salad, thinking it is an ordinary lemon (I literally gasped at that scene.)It's not just about the money for the esrog, that was already spent in any case.  It's about them possibly destroying the blessing for a child.  And this is the moment where Moshe runs off into the woods, begging God that ""I don't want to be angry.""  Because by now we know that Moshe was not always religious, and in his former secular life he had been a very violent man.  Throughout the film there are references to controlling anger.  So this is about Moshe seeing his greatest hope dashed to the ground -- the last straw in a series of difficult tests, a test that almost causes him to lose his temper and backslide into old behaviors.  (There is also a reference in this film to the biblical Abraham and Sarah, which evokes the Jewish teaching that Abraham had to pass ten tests before Sarah conceived a child -- that's not in the Bible, but it's a well-known story among religious Jews.)As for the guests themselves, there is much symbolism there, too.Traditionally, ""Ushpizin"" refers to the ""Seven Shepherds"" -- Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David -- who symbolically come to the sukkah (one each night) on the seven nights of the festival.  But there is also a teaching that the Prophet Elijah comes down in disguise and can be anyone -- even an escaped convict -- to test one's faith.  And of course, people invite ordinary guests to the sukkah as well.  But underlying it all is the idea that every guest should be treated as if he or she might be a saint in disguise (which, my Christian friends, is the Jewish origin of your own teaching about entertaining angels unawares:  ""Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it."" -- Hebrews 13:2)  Remember, too, that it was two angels who came to Abraham and Sarah to announce the coming birth of Isaac -- so who are those two annoying convicts REALLY?  At the end of the film, when they peek around the door at the circumcision ceremony, you get the feeling -- just for a moment -- that they are more than just visitors from Moshe's past.Of course, one can watch the film without knowing all of this.  I just thought you might like to have a little more depth to it, because peeking into someone else's culture often requires more translation than just the subtitles.  A lot of Hasidic culture is what anthropologists call ""context-sensitive,"" which means it's not always explained in words, you have to get it from the non-verbal cues.  So I thought you might like to know what some of those cues are.  Shalom - peace.And Oh -- one more thing:  The men hugging and dancing together is NOT homosexuality.  In Haredi culture, same-sex dancing and hugging, even kissing each other on the cheek, is normal behavior everyone does, it has no sexual connotations.  Body language varies from  culture to culture - think in terms of Russians or Frenchmen embracing.  Same for the two convicts, there is nothing sexual between them, either.",5,"As a Breslov Hasid myself, I found the film refreshing and authentic",1276646400,"06 16, 2010",2010,9105,"['one', 'few',

970707,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000E8QVAQ,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[7, 7]","""Ushpizin"" is a seldom-used word for ""guests"".  The word is largely unique to the holiday of ""Succot"" which falls out near the cusp of Summer-Fall.  A largely joyous holiday free of the gravitas of ""Rosh Hashana"" and ""Yom Kippur"" (which it follows), Succot nevertheless tempts the souls of those who aren't in any mood to party.  The film follows the luckless Moshe Belanga and his wife Mali, Hasidic denizens of Jerusalem's Haredi community.  He's a Rabbi who can barely find a few coins to rub together, and they are both childless.  But they are followers of Breslau Hasidism which prizes happiness as man's purpose in life.  We learn that Moshe and Mali were not born into their current world - they are ""Chozer Beteshuvah"", religious by choice after an earlier secular existence.The story starts the day before the holiday's eve, with Moshe too penniless to afford to build the succah itself (a small hut with a thatched roof intended to be lived in during the holiday) or the ""4 species"" (a bundle of palm flanked by other twigs and accompanied by a citron known as an ""etrog"").  Moshe has long accepted a simple and pious life as his lot, but it's his wife who must face down the landlord while trying to eke out living selling wares to other Hareidi.  Worse, Mali worries that her childlessness is a sign that she's ruining Moshe's life.  The two (separately) pour out their hearts to the almighty - and are rewarded by a twin miracle, money and a free succah.  At first they rejoice a windfall that will allow them to enjoy the holiday, but then soon come to believe that they're just being tested.  Into the mix, the story tosses two escaped cons - one of whom knows Moshe from his wilder pre-Hareidi days; the perturbed owner of the succah that Moshe is using; and a perfect paragon of an etrog that's considered priceless, but which costs Moshe 1,000 sheqels.  (I think that that was about $250 when this movie was made.)  At first Moshe rebuffs his ""guests"" but soon regrets that decision, being reminded of Abraham's and Sarah's biblical example of accepting and serving the dregs of society.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but hadn't planned to.  ""Ushpizin"" in turns, is funny, sad and even thrilling.  It's never entirely clear just what sort of note will mark the next scene.  Even if you have no interest in the rituals of ""orthodox Judaism"", the script bridges cultural gaps much as any foreign film would, using the character's penchant for prayer as a convenient window into their souls.  The story doesn't require you to understand or have any peculiar respect for Judaism or any of its rituals or ""formalities"", and in fact shows how they wrestle with pretty much the same dilemmas faced by people who wouldn't know an etrog from a lemon - am I supposed to be happy, am I being punished, should I accept that punishment, stuff like that.  I thought the d&eacute;nouement and the ending were a bit pat, but avoided the worst excesses of the ""Hollywood Ending"".  Any dismissal of this movie as a Jewish story is narrow-minded, shortsighted an by any other measure, plainly wrong.  These characters see existence as temporary - we're all guests of a sort, but some of us are just lucky enough to play host and dispense kindness.",4,You don't have understand Hasidic Judaism to make yourself at home in this story,1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,3249,"['Ushpizin', 'seldom-used', 'word', 'guests', 'word', 'largely', 'unique', 'holiday', 'Succot', 'out', 'cusp', 'Summer-Fall', 'A', 'largely', 'joyous', 'holiday', 'free', 'gravitas', 'Rosh', 'Hashana', 'Yom', 'Kippur', 'Succot', 'nevertheless', 'souls', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'mood', 'party', 'film', 'luckless', 'Moshe', 'Belanga', 'wife', 'Mali', 'Hasidic', 'Jerusalem', 'Haredi', 'community', 'Rabbi', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'find', 'few', 'coins', 'rub', 'together', 'are', 'childless', 'are', 'followers', 'Breslau', 'Hasidism', 'happiness', 'man', 'purpose', 'life', 'learn', 'Moshe', 'Mali', 'were', 'not', 'born', 'current', 'world', 'are', 'Chozer', 'Beteshuvah', 'religious', 'choice', 'earlier', 'secular', 'existence.The', 'story', 'day', 'holiday', 'eve', 'Moshe', 'too', 'penniless', 'afford', 'build', 'succah', 'small', 'hut', 'thatched', 'roof', 'intended', 'be', 'lived', 'holiday', '4', 'species', 'bundle', 'palm', 'flanked', 'other', 'twigs', 'accompanied', 'citron', 'known', 'etrog', 'Moshe', 'long', 'accepted', 'simple', 'pious', 'life', 'lot', 'wife', 'who', 'must', 'face', 'down', 'landlord', 'trying', 'eke', 'out', 'living', 'selling', 'wares', 'other', 'Hareidi', 'Worse', 'Mali', 'childlessness', 'sign', 'ruining', 'Moshe', 'life', 'two', 'separately', 'pour', 'out', 'hearts', 'almighty', 'are', 'rewarded', 'twin', 'miracle', 'money', 'free', 'succah', 'first', 'rejoice', 'windfall', 'will', 'allow', 'enjoy', 'holiday', 'then', 'soon', 'come', 'believe', ""'re"", 'just', 'being', 'tested', 'mix', 'story', 'two', 'escaped', 'cons', 'one', 'whom', 'Moshe', 'wilder', 'pre-Hareidi', 'days', 'perturbed', 'owner', 'succah', 'Moshe', 'using', 'perfect', 'paragon', 'etrog', 'considered', 'priceless', 'Moshe', '1,000', 'sheqels', 'think', 'was', '250', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'first', 'Moshe', 'rebuffs', 'guests', 'soon', 'regrets', 'decision', 'being', 'reminded', 'Abraham', 'Sarah', 'biblical', 'example', 'accepting', 'serving', 'dregs', 'society.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'planned', 'Ushpizin', 'turns', 'funny', 'sad', 'even', 'thrilling', 'never', 'entirely', 'clear', 'just', 'what', 'sort', 'note', 'will', 'mark', 'next', 'scene', 'Even', 'have', 'interest', 'rituals', 'orthodox', 'Judaism', 'script', 'cultural', 'gaps', 'much', 'foreign', 'film', 'would', 'using', 'character', 'penchant', 'prayer', 'convenient', 'window', 'souls', 'story', ""n't"", 'require', 'understand', 'have', 'peculiar', 'respect', 'Judaism', 'rituals', 'formalities', 'fact', 'how', 'wrestle', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'dilemmas', 'faced', 'people', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'etrog', 'lemon', 'am', 'supposed', 'be', 'happy', 'am', 'being', 'punished', 'should', 'accept', 'punishment', 'stuff', 'thought', 'd', 'eacute', 'nouement', 'ending', 'were', 'bit', 'pat', 'avoided', 'worst', 'excesses', 'Hollywood', 'Ending', 'dismissal', 'movie', 'Jewish', 'story', 'narrow-minded', 'shortsighted', 'other', 'measure', 'plainly', 'wrong', 'characters', 'see', 'existence', 'temporary', ""'re"", 'guests', 'sort', 'are', 'just', 'lucky', 'enough', 'play', 'host', 'dispense', 'kindness']",N/A

I however would like to mention the wonderful depiction of Jerusalem's Nahlaot area. The beauty of this part of Jerusalem is a major part of this movie. It helps make for the sanctity of the mood and the scene.I might say I did not like everything about the movie. The two criminal characters part in it seemed to me exaggerated, and somewhat unbelievable.

We keep waiting for the credulous couple and their community to become the butt of cruel jokes, but they never do.  Instead of getting the stereotypical ""oy gevalt"" Yiddish humor we're expecting, the strained yet simple faith of the Orthodox couple turns out to be the one true thing in the film.There aren't many horselaughs in the movie, but one sight gag is a winner.  The guests, who have infuriated Mali and Moshe beyond endurance, have taken refuge under a bed. As the couple quarrel with each other, one speaks up from time to time, earning him a kick from both of them, alternately.This dvd badly needed a ""the making of..."" track in the extras.  According to one online movie directory, the lead actor and screenwriter really is a haredim, and the film was shot in a real orthodox neighborhood.  It would have been fascinating to hear interviews about how the movie came to be.",3,"""You've really changed, Moshe--I respect that.""",1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,1032,"['What', 'true', 'Ushpizin', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'true', 'haredi', 'are', 'like', 'pineapples', 'prickly', 'outside', 'sweet', 'inside', 'keep', 'waiting', 'credulous', 'couple', 'community', 'become', 'butt', 'cruel', 'jokes', 'never', 'do', 'Instead', 'getting', 'stereotypical', 'oy', 'gevalt', 'Yiddish', 'humor', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'strained', 'yet', 'simple', 'faith', 'Orthodox', 'couple', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'true', 'thing', 'film.There', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'horselaughs', 'movie', 'one', 'sight', 'gag', 'winner', 'guests', 'who', 'have', 'infuriated', 'Mali', 'Moshe', 'endurance', 'have', 'taken', 'refuge', 'bed', 'couple', 'quarrel', 'other', 'one', 'time', 'time', 'earning', 'kick', 'alternately.This', 'badly', 'needed', 'making', 'track', 'extras', 'According', 'one', 'online', 'movie', 'directory', 'lead', 'actor', 'screenwriter', 'really', 'haredim', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'real', 'orthodox', 'neighborhood', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'hear', 'interviews', 'how', 'movie', 'came', 'be']",N/A

He doesn't even have enough money to by a citron for Succoth, or the availablity to build a sukkot for the ceremonies. Then the miracle happens; a chance clerical snafu selects them to recieve a charity donation, a friend finds them an unused sukkot and Moeshe begins his ceremony believing his luck has turned.There is but one more test. Two less than savory characters - escaped convicts - show up and remind Moeshe of his past affiliations. They threaten everything...Moeshe's conviction, his status in the community and even his marriage. ""Ushpizin"" is a study in his tests, and carries the story with conviction and love, all without the cheap theatrics one would associate with a Hollywood treatment of similar material.""Ushpizin"" is a very good movie for the morals that it attempts to convey. The acting is understateded, delightfully so (especially Shuli Rand as Rabbi Moeshe). These are not glamorous characthers and they must carry the movie on their abilty to convice you that their life and faith is real, as well as the sense of fragilty. I found myself cringing inside when the two criminals began to disrupt the neighborhood and Mali (Michal Bat Sheva Rand, again excellent performance) found herself struggling with the decision to confront or retreat.
