11001,ACAO2J1XCS4FL,0767811437,Alexander Suraev,"[3, 5]","It was a long Sunday evening that has started with watchingFight Club and hating that schlock. Looking for an antidote - and theevening's second feature - I chose Hal Hartley's Henry Fool. Another film about a guru coming into the life of dissatisfied young man to widen the horizons, to take it to the limit. But, hopefully, with a different accent.It's very, very good, especially at the second viewing a couple days later when I saw the things in a perspective.Henry reminds me vaguely of Lou Pascal from Louis Malle's Atlantic City - the &quot;mobster&quot; retired from the &quot;bloody work&quot; he never did. He charms people with his fake sophistication, lives on their money and makes love to any body available.  Lou is noblier, but when the time comes Henry also answers it's call, though in even clumsier way.Thomas Jay Ryan seems to be genetically bred for the part. The head of a water buffalo, the stubborn look of self-proclaimed genius, the flaring nostrils. How I liked him walking in a dark three-piece suit and white running shoes!He is a manipulator, but the person he is fooling with all the time is himself. If only he was a bit smarter, not so self-deluded! He'd never try to publish his opus and get an earful of truth as a reward. He would just burn the pulp in the furnace, sit for a day somewhere near, emitting the sad whispers: - No...not yet...the world is not ready for that...it's too...too...no... - and then speak for the rest of his life of Nobel prize - winning mediocricy that is no match to the masterpiece he buried with his own hands. But he is a Fool after all!What I liked the most about the film is that almost any time my thoughts tried to slip into the groove chiseled in my brain by watching the current Holliwood produce, the plot - if the word is appropriate here - took an unanticipated turn.Simon promises Henry to back up his book, to put his own poemm's publication at stake, then reads the guru's blubbering and signs his contract. And surprisingly it does not look like a treachery.There is a lot of quirky moments put in the film with no particular reason. Simon's vomitting and Henry's noisy pooping are nothing more than a respectful bows in a general direction of alternative cinema.  Somehow the public emittance of bodily substances is required by the genre - just like shootouts and car chases are the must in action flicks.And there are some totally meaningless gems I've enjoyed. Remember the school paper's board of editors - white, black and Asian girls in the shop - a model of humanitty divided in controversy over Simon's statement?Is the scene - or the film itself - smart, or funny, or stupid? None of these.  It's just so, It's something else. And the thing I am looking for these days is that something else.P.S. I am shocked by Leonard Maltin's review. Are there any qualification tests for film critics? Evidently there were none at the time he got a job.",5,Delightfool.,960940800,"06 14, 2000",2000,2931,"['was', 'long', 'Sunday', 'evening', 'started', 'watchingFight', 'Club', 'hating', 'schlock', 'Looking', 'antidote', 'theevening', 'second', 'feature', 'chose', 'Hal', 'Hartley', 'Henry', 'Fool', 'film', 'guru', 'coming', 'life', 'dissatisfied', 'young', 'man', 'widen', 'horizons', 'take', 'limit', 'hopefully', 'different', 'accent.It', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'second', 'viewing', 'couple', 'days', 'later', 'when', 'saw', 'things', 'perspective.Henry', 'vaguely', 'Lou', 'Pascal', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'quot', 'mobster', 'quot', 'retired', 'quot', 'bloody', 'work', 'quot', 'never', 'did', 'people', 'fake', 'sophistication', 'money', 'love', 'body', 'available', 'Lou', 'noblier', 'when', 'time', 'Henry', 'also', 'call', 'even', 'clumsier', 'way.Thomas', 'Jay', 'Ryan', 'be', 'genetically', 'bred', 'part', 'head', 'water', 'buffalo', 'stubborn', 'look', 'self-proclaimed', 'genius', 'flaring', 'nostrils', 'How', 'liked', 'walking', 'dark', 'three-piece', 'suit', 'white', 'running', 'shoes', 'manipulator', 'person', 'fooling', 'time', 'only', 'was', 'bit', 'smarter', 'not', 'so', 'self-deluded', ""'d"", 'never', 'try', 'publish', 'opus', 'get', 'earful', 'truth', 'reward', 'would', 'just', 'burn', 'pulp', 'furnace', 'sit', 'day', 'somewhere', 'near', 'emitting', 'sad', 'whispers', 'not', 'yet', 'world', 'not', 'ready', 'too', 'too', 'then', 'speak', 'rest', 'life', 'Nobel', 'prize', 'winning', 'mediocricy', 'match', 'masterpiece', 'buried', 'own', 'hands', 'Fool', 'What', 'liked', 'most', 'film', 'almost', 'time', 'thoughts', 'tried', 'slip', 'groove', 'chiseled', 'brain', 'watching', 'current', 'Holliwood', 'produce', 'plot', 'word', 'appropriate', 'here', 'took', 'unanticipated', 'turn.Simon', 'Henry', 'back', 'up', 'book', 'put', 'own', 'poemm', 'publication', 'stake', 'then', 'guru', 'blubbering', 'signs', 'contract', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'look', 'lot', 'quirky', 'moments', 'put', 'film', 'particular', 'reason', 'Simon', 'vomitting', 'Henry', 'noisy', 'pooping', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'respectful', 'bows', 'general', 'direction', 'alternative', 'cinema', 'Somehow', 'public', 'emittance', 'bodily', 'substances', 'required', 'genre', 'just', 'shootouts', 'car', 'chases', 'are', 'must', 'action', 'flicks.And', 'are', 'totally', 'meaningless', 'gems', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Remember', 'school', 'paper', 'board', 'editors', 'white', 'black', 'Asian', 'girls', 'shop', 'model', 'humanitty', 'divided', 'controversy', 'Simon', 'statement', 'scene', 'film', 'smart', 'funny', 'stupid', 'None', 'just', 'so', 'something', 'else', 'thing', 'am', 'looking', 'days', 'something', 'else.P.S', 'am', 'shocked', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'review', 'Are', 'there', 'qualification', 'tests', 'film', 'critics', 'Evidently', 'were', 'none', 'time', 'got', 'job']",N/A

11003,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,0767811437,Amy Lynn,"[1, 1]","Hartley's 7th film, Henry Fool is a dark comedy that takes place in Queens NY and revolves around the main characters who's personalities seem to fit their names. James Urbaniak plays Simon 'Grim', a timid young garbageman who lives with his depressed mother. Simon's sister, 'Fay Grim', played by Parker Posey and Thomas Jay Ryan as Henry 'Fool', an arrogant confident drifter he encounters who becomes his mentor as both share a similar passion for poetry and writing downs one's thoughts.For Simon Henry seems to be a good and bad influence at the same time. Henry has some demons in his past that he's trying to escape from to further his career while at the same time inspiring Simon to follow his dreams. It's ironic how the story turns out and despite all the issues these characters have with eachother they are still protective of eachother. This story is really about the complex relationships of the characters and how success can affect someone and what happens when the roles are reversed.I loved Henry Fool. All the characters were interesting. Henry was great and Parker Posey was amazing. They both had good chemistry with eachother. It was funny, bold, depressing, vulgar and satirical all at the same time. There is a lot going on this movie.

11006,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0767811437,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[8, 9]","One tries not to throw the word brilliant around too often, as doing so robs the word of any meaning, so I am quite sincere when I bestow the word brilliant on this remarkable film - after all, what is artistic brilliance if not the ability to call forth beauty from the midst of ugliness?  This story takes place against a depressing backdrop of poverty, desperation, and dysfunction.  Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) works as a garbage man, endures physical attacks on the streets, and comes home each night to a thoroughly dysfunctional family.  His mother is obviously depressed and, at times, nonresponsive, while his sister Faye (Parker Posey) is irresponsible and only interested in fulfilling her own sexual needs as often as possible.  Simon himself seems anti-social if not mentally challenged.  Then a stranger named Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan) shows up and changes everything.  He has a magnetic personality, albeit one that pushes some people away while drawing others in, and he befriends Simon.  Beaming literary pretentiousness, Henry goes on and on about his personal memoirs (or confessions), which he assures Simon will revolutionize the world and society when they are completed and published.  When Simon begins following Henry's lead, he produces a new kind of poetry, one which Henry hails as cutting-edge and revolutionary.  While his mother and sister ridicule him, Simon is encouraged by Henry to keep writing, rightly pointing to some amazing changes that occur in individuals who read a sampling of his work.  Critics initially hail his great poem as poorly written and pornographic (the ultimate put-down), yet Simon perseveres through doubt, tragedy, and controversy, eventually meeting with great success - which changes the lives of these characters irrevocably.In many ways, this film really is all about Henry Fool himself.  He's a mystery for much of this film, a strange external force that shows up out of nowhere and changes the lives of those around him.  He is an exceptional fellow - but not necessarily what he appears.  As the film progresses, we learn more and more about his troubled past and witness his emotional decline in both the present and the future.  His darkest secrets and weaknesses are revealed, he becomes more and more dependent on alcohol and cigarettes, and the mask covering the ugliness of his life begins to slip.  Even at his worst, though, he is thoroughly human and morbidly fascinating (and something of a mirror to the souls of many of us, if we're honest enough to admit it), especially at the end when the story has basically come full circle.There is no character like Henry Fool, and Jay Henry Thomas is absolutely amazing in the role.  Great performances abound in this film, while Hal Hartley's direction is impeccable.  I don't know what to call the world Hartley has created in this film: it's hyper-surreal yet completely realistic at the same time.  It deals with an amazing range of issues head on; oftentimes shockingly direct yet always poignant and surprisingly deep.  As others have said, this is not a film that could ever have been borne of a major studio; only an independent filmmaker can take the kind of chances that Hartley takes here, or take such a seemingly simple idea and imbue it with such depth, emotional resonance, and integrity.  Henry Fool is nothing less than a stellar, bloody brilliant film.",5,"An absolutely brilliant, mesmerizing film",1160784000,"10 14, 2006",2006,3394,"['One', 'not', 'throw', 'word', 'brilliant', 'too', 'often', 'doing', 'so', 'robs', 'word', 'meaning', 'am', 'quite', 'sincere', 'when', 'bestow', 'word', 'brilliant', 'remarkable', 'film', 'what', 'artistic', 'brilliance', 'not', 'ability', 'call', 'forth', 'beauty', 'midst', 'ugliness', 'story', 'place', 'depressing', 'backdrop', 'poverty', 'desperation', 'dysfunction', 'Simon', 'Grim', 'James', 'Urbaniak', 'garbage', 'man', 'physical', 'attacks', 'streets', 'home', 'night', 'thoroughly', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'mother', 'obviously', 'depressed', 'times', 'nonresponsive', 'sister', 'Faye', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'irresponsible', 'only', 'interested', 'fulfilling', 'own', 'sexual', 'needs', 'as', 'often', 'possible', 'Simon', 'anti-social', 'not', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'Then', 'stranger', 'named', 'Henry', 'Fool', 'Thomas', 'Jay', 'Ryan', 'up', 'changes', 'everything', 'magnetic', 'personality', 'one', 'people', 'away', 'drawing', 'others', 'Simon', 'Beaming', 'literary', 'pretentiousness', 'Henry', 'personal', 'memoirs', 'confessions', 'Simon', 'will', 'revolutionize', 'world', 'society', 'when', 'are', 'completed', 'published', 'When', 'Simon', 'following', 'Henry', 'lead', 'new', 'kind', 'poetry', 'one', 'Henry', 'cutting-edge', 'revolutionary', 'mother', 'sister', 'ridicule', 'Simon', 'encouraged', 'Henry', 'keep', 'writing', 'rightly', 'pointing', 'amazing', 'changes', 'occur', 'individuals', 'who', 'read', 'sampling', 'work', 'Critics', 'initially', 'hail', 'great', 'poem', 'poorly', 'written', 'pornographic', 'ultimate', 'put-down', 'yet', 'Simon', 'perseveres', 'doubt', 'tragedy', 'controversy', 'eventually', 'meeting', 'great', 'success', 'lives', 'characters', 'irrevocably.In', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'really', 'Henry', 'Fool', 'mystery', 'much', 'film', 'strange', 'external', 'force', 'up', 'nowhere', 'lives', 'exceptional', 'fellow', 'not', 'necessarily', 'what', 'film', 'learn', 'more', 'more', 'troubled', 'past', 'witness', 'emotional', 'decline', 'present', 'future', 'darkest', 'secrets', 'weaknesses', 'are', 'revealed', 'more', 'more', 'dependent', 'alcohol', 'cigarettes', 'mask', 'covering', 'ugliness', 'life', 'slip', 'Even', 'worst', 'though', 'thoroughly', 'human', 'morbidly', 'fascinating', 'something', 'mirror', 'souls', 'many', ""'re"", 'honest', 'enough', 'admit', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'story', 'basically', 'come', 'full', 'circle.There', 'character', 'Henry', 'Fool', 'Jay', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'role', 'Great', 'abound', 'film', 'Hal', 'Hartley', 'direction', 'impeccable', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'call', 'world', 'Hartley', 'created', 'film', 'hyper-surreal', 'yet', 'completely', 'realistic', 'same', 'time', 'amazing', 'range', 'issues', 'head', 'oftentimes', 'shockingly', 'direct', 'yet', 'always', 'poignant', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'not', 'film', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'been', 'borne', 'major', 'studio', 'only', 'independent', 'filmmaker', 'can', 'take', 'kind', 'chances', 'Hartley', 'here', 'take', 'such', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'idea', 'imbue', 'such', 'depth', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'integrity', 'Henry', 'Fool', 'nothing', 'less', 'stellar', 'bloody', 'brilliant', 'film']",N/A
11007,A1K8QP2M2DVAA4,0767811437,Dillon Lee,"[1, 2]","Don't make my (almost) mistake, start with Henry Fool. I don't wish to discuss one without the other because of reasons made clear below.It would be difficult for me to discuss my sudden love of these two films without providing some context. FAY GRIM has long been a recommended film for me on Amazon, probably because of my random predilection towards Indie films. I'm also a fan of Parker Posey, mainly from her work in Christopher Guest's improvisational mockumentaries, and James Urbaniak, from his work on Venture Brothers. So I began to watch a film billed as a comedy, drama, and a thriller. I was instantly confused, or more accurately- put off and fascinated by the constant Dutch angles, inherent quirkiness and the stylized, almost theatrical, blocking and character movement. I wasn't sure if I liked it or not; to provide perspective I consulted IMDB, thinking information on the writer/director may illuminate things. To my surprise, FAY GRIM is the 2006 sequel to a 1998 indie called HENRY FOOL, starring the same cast. So naturally, ten minutes in, I stopped to track down Henry. It was conveniently on Amazon as well. There I found a film strange, quirky and in some ways indicative of the 90's independent filmmaking. Henry Fool, while the title character, is more about James Urbaniak's character Simon Grim, an quiet, awkward garbage man from Queens. Henry Fool is the strange alcoholic, blow hard drifter who upsets the dysfunctional balance of the Grim home by serving as Simon's mentor. Fool convinces him to write down his thoughts, these become controversial, avante garde poems. HENRY FOOL isn't for everyone. The subject matter is rough and crude (similar to Showtime's SHAMELESS); the camera work and acting is heavily stylized. The director Hal Hartley came up in the independent film boom of the 90's. His quirky fingerprints are all over the place- the names are indicative of the characters as Henry seems much the fool and Simon's life and attitude is definitively grim. There is even a conservative anti-immigrant politician character cheekily named Owen Feer. A shot is framed and one character will drift off frame and reappear, constantly changing levels as a stage actor would.Then comes FAY GRIM, the name of Parker Posey's character, and the sequel's title. This movie is almost completely different. Its an honest to goodness international spy thriller, though the strange and stilted characters are thrust, seemingly haplessly into this world. Suddenly, everything you learned or thought you learned by the end of HENRY FOOL is cast into doubt. This once poor and still dysfunctional Grim family is inadvertently caught up in something involving five different international espionage agencies and global terrorism. Keep in mind the setting of HENRY FOOL was essentially ONE NEIGHBORHOOD, suddenly these same characters are unraveling government codes and globe trotting. And, yes, the absurdity of that is part of the fun and genuine humor. The juxtaposition would be lost without HENRY FOOL however. If this interests you at all THAT must be required viewing. The real magic is this- by the third act, you're convinced; you're invested. You see character's in a profoundly different light. I'm probably the only person I even tangentially know who have seen these small obscure films, but there are some really wonderful little things I could delve into in a real conversation. One I will mention, HENRY FOOL ends ambiguously and in FAY GRIM that ambiguity is excoriated by the characters. As if they are saying, ""that ending wasn't ambiguous at all. Weren't you paying attention."" Given the radical tonal and substantive shift from HENRY FOOL to FAY GRIM, I was excited to learn that Hartley is currently working on the final film in the trilogy, NED RIFLE. Again with the same cast of actors and characters.

Van,"[42, 48]","Warning: neither DVD version of this film -- the original 2003 version from Sony, or the 2012 ""Choice Collection"" on-demand DVD-R -- is a widescreen presentation of the original film, which was in 1.66:1 aspect ratio.  THEY ARE BOTH A MATTED (VERTICALLY TRIMMED) VERSION OF THE PAN-AND-SCAN VHS VERSION, WHICH MEANS THEY ARE 60% OF THE ORIGINAL IMAGE. The image you're seeing was generated by taking the ""reformatted for your TV"" VHS version, which chopped off the sides of the original theatrical image, and *further chopping* it to fit the widescreen format by eliminating the top and bottom of the VHS image. I froze the image of James Urbaniak sitting during the credits sequence on VHS and the new DVD, and toggled between them: in the VHS he fills exactly 2/3 of the screen, vertically, which is clearly the way Hal Hartley framed it. In the DVD, he fills a claustrophobic 86% of the image.The Sony version correctly identifies the aspect ratio as 1.78:1, which was a tip-off that it's been altered. The new version falsely claims the original 1.66:1 ratio, and the DVD-R ""learn more"" link asserts that ""all products are manufactured from original source materials,"" which in this case is patently untrue. All they seem to have done is take the existing digital file and excised the giveaway ""This film has been reformatted for your television"" notice from the VHS tape, which the original Sony DVD actually left in! They haven't gone anywhere near an original negative or positive of the film.Since the new version is more expensive than the old, I'm guessing that the entire rationale of this re-release (on Amazon's part) was to finally present it properly. They seemed to have been scammed by their content provider (who may have been scammed by the studio).Folks who have never seen this in the theater or on VHS may find it watchable, but note: Hal Hartley does not favor extreme closeups and he does not routinely cut the tops of the heads off of his characters, which is the experience you get from these DVDs. When Henry Fool first appears on screen, walking towards the camera, he's supposed to be relatively small, echoing Omar Sharif's arrival in Lawrence of Arabia a bit -- an effect completely destroyed on these DVDs.

I liked it very much, but I can also see how people could hate it. ""Henry Fool"" is a story that is light on plot, but is carried by its characters. Simon Grim is a New York garbage collector who lives a miserable existence with his depressed mother and his promiscuous sister (Parker Posey). However, all of that changes when Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan), an ex-convict and aspiring writer, rents a room in Simon's basement and convinces Simon that he should quit his job and focus all of his efforts on writing a poem of epic proportions.Whether you like this film or not will largely depend on how you feel about the main characters and where your sense of humour lies. This film is classed as a comedy and I found it to be very funny, but the humour is not ""conventional"" comedy humour. All of the lines are delivered dead-pan and their humour largely lies in their context within the film.

It's like staring at a palette of beautiful colors - then stepping back to realize it's a bruise. Henry is never less than this astonishing.As Henry,Thomas Jay Ryan gives what is easily the best film debut I've seen in many years. None of the wimpy whispery-voiced drivel that passes for acting these days (from even some of our best screen actors) his performance practically pops off of the screen like a fart at a funeral. The rest of the cast - James Urbaniak, Parker Posey, Maria Porter, Kevin Corrigan, et al. - are on the same inspired level, but it's obvious why the film is named after Henry. I cannot wait to see this man in more.Obviously allegorical, &quot;Henry Fool&quot; fairly teems with its laundry list of symbolism both quaint and profound, easy and impossible. I found my cheeks hurting from the smile stretching across my face for much of the film. Other moments had my eyes welling with tears at the beauty - and pain - these oh, so deceptively simple lives toil through.This is not, obviously, a film for all audiences, there is something of the fairy tale here and while suspension of disbelief is required, it is also its own reward. Actually the characters, though larger than life, are so evenly and wondrously drawn as to become recognizable to all of us as ourselves or others in our own lives. Here we weigh out the seemingly unfair advantages we perceive &quot;others&quot; has having, the pronouncements of self-worth and desire for acceptance and understanding.Hartley's dialogue is equal to the visual aspects of his film: almost stagey (in the good sense), but with a direct honesty that many, unfortunately, will find offputting. His cast delivers these perfectly placed pronouncements with all the gravitas demanded of the situation - and sound natural doing so. It's a beautiful film to listen to.Aside from the brilliant storytelling, &quot;Henry&quot; is also beautiful to look at. Hartley's cameramen lens a Queenscape most unusual - one never quite feels he knows where it's taking place, despite obvious &quot;Queens&quot; clues. Every frame - from Henry's powerfully bizarre arrival to the last triumphant (and gloriously ambiguous) cell is a pleasure, a joy to watch.At its conclusion all I could say was &quot;this was the best movie I've ever seen.&quot; Upon reflection, I realize it probably isn't, but at that moment (and each ensuing viewing) I recapture that same, precise feeling.

Henry makes time for Simon only because it  amuses him to do so - he feels superior to Simon, even in the face of  Simon's awakening greatness, but once Simon becomes independent of him  (witness the negotiation scene between Simon and the publishing mogul),  then Henry dismisses Simon as part of the world that doesn't understand his  ""unique"" and lamentably absent genius.But, to his defense, Henry does  exhibit flashes of true humanity.  He does love Fay, although he is  incapable of showing it for more than a few minutes at a time.  He is  genuinely concerned about the abused Pearl and her mother, although it  unwittingly gets him into a larger mess than anticipated.  In his attempts  to show his artistic sensibilities at the start of the film, Henry  unwittingly sparks Simon's genius by encouraging him to write down any  thoughts that strike him, although its clear that Henry expects nothing of  import.  Henry is the catalyst for Simon, Fay, and others' lives, and the  fact that he does so little while talking so much is part of the ironic fun  in this film - those who speak the least (Simon, Henry's son, and Daughter  Dang) are the ones who do the most.At the bottom of it all, Henry's  biggest failing to refusing to accept his mistakes and crimes.  He claims  unrepentance but feels a deep-seated shame that comes out in his excuses -  ""People like us, Simon, great writers, can't be tied down to the everyday  mundane existence of the common rabble"" is a speech that resurfaces time  and time again as a reason to avoid everyday labor, and the fact that he  claims that his affair with the 13-year-old is part of some conspiracy  against him is symptomatic of his refusal to come to terms with  himself.The nature of discontent and how it brings out our seamier  qualities is exemplified in Henry and other characters.  The characters who  accept their lives as given are the ones who succeed, while those who are  discontented are driven to crime, drug and alcohol abuse, denigration of  their families, and suicide ""Does it matter that it's not remarkable?"" asks  Simon of his clinically depressed mother.  ""Yes,"" she replies, shortly  before her death.In short, Henry is a fool - he knows what is right, but  he does wrong for the gluttonous joy of it.  He knows what he should do to  succeed in the world but chooses to live off of others because it would be  too much effort otherwise.  He has every reason to be content (a house, a  lovely wife, a loving son, and a steady if menial job) but prefers his  cynical and self-destructive worldview.  He is everything that the world  tells us can bring no good - and yet, he does manage to procreate two great  things of beauty while living with the Grims - an amazing poet and a  kindly, intelligent son.  In the end, Henry is provided with a choice - to  either run from his troubles as he has always done or to face the music and  be a mensch.  Which does he choose? is the question that Hartley leaves us  with, along with the rest of this quirky, bumpy film.While a good show,  ""Henry Fool"" is not as engaging as ""Trust"" nor as offbeat as ""Amateur.""  However, it is still a film worth watching.  Forget the over-wraught  analytical nonsense that the some many of the other reviewers and I have  spewed - instead, watch this film and see if you can recognize a Henry Fool  in your life.",4,What a bunch of Henry Fools,951868800,"03 1, 2000",2000,4194,"['Hartley', 'were', 'reading', 'page', 'reviews', 'would', 'be', 'laughing', 'silly', 'So', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'could', 'be', 'Henry', 'Fool', 'pathetic.The', 'first', 'thing', 'one', 'realize', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'watching', 'even', 'halfway', 'closely', 'Henry', 'Fool', 'full', 'sheer', 'irony', 'film', 'nothing', 'what', 'be', 'tortured', 'genius', 'misunderstood', 'writer', 'callous', 'scoundrel', 'etc', 'simultaneously', 'everything', 'primarily', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'elite', 'Henry', 'epitome', 'pretentious', 'slacker', 'plaguing', 'modern', 'America', 'always', 'complaining', 'always', 'do', 'something', 'momentous', 'always', 'focusing', 'his/her', 'needs', 'always', 'feeding', 'others', 'never', 'providing', 'unselfish', 'moment', 'others', 'Henry', 'time', 'Simon', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'superior', 'Simon', 'even', 'face', 'Simon', 'awakening', 'greatness', 'once', 'Simon', 'independent', 'negotiation', 'scene', 'Simon', 'publishing', 'mogul', 'then', 'Henry', 'Simon', 'part', 'world', ""n't"", 'understand', 'unique', 'lamentably', 'absent', 'genius.But', 'defense', 'Henry', 'exhibit', 'flashes', 'true', 'humanity', 'love', 'Fay', 'incapable', 'showing', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', 'time', 'genuinely', 'concerned', 'abused', 'Pearl', 'mother', 'unwittingly', 'larger', 'mess', 'anticipated', 'attempts', 'show', 'artistic', 'sensibilities', 'start', 'film', 'Henry', 'unwittingly', 'Simon', 'genius', 'encouraging', 'write', 'down', 'thoughts', 'strike', 'clear', 'Henry', 'nothing', 'import', 'Henry', 'catalyst', 'Simon', 'Fay', 'others', 'lives', 'fact', 'so', 'little', 'talking', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'ironic', 'fun', 'film', 'who', 'speak', 'least', 'Simon', 'Henry', 'son', 'Daughter', 'Dang', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'do', 'most.At', 'bottom', 'Henry', 'biggest', 'failing', 'refusing', 'accept', 'mistakes', 'crimes', 'unrepentance', 'deep-seated', 'shame', 'out', 'excuses', 'People', 'Simon', 'great', 'writers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'tied', 'everyday', 'mundane', 'existence', 'common', 'rabble', 'speech', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'reason', 'avoid', 'everyday', 'labor', 'fact', 'affair', '13-year-old', 'part', 'conspiracy', 'symptomatic', 'refusal', 'come', 'terms', 'himself.The', 'nature', 'discontent', 'how', 'out', 'seamier', 'qualities', 'exemplified', 'Henry', 'other', 'characters', 'characters', 'who', 'accept', 'lives', 'given', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'succeed', 'who', 'are', 'discontented', 'are', 'driven', 'crime', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'denigration', 'families', 'suicide', 'Does', 'matter', 'not', 'remarkable', 'Simon', 'clinically', 'depressed', 'mother', 'Yes', 'shortly', 'death.In', 'short', 'Henry', 'fool', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'gluttonous', 'joy', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'succeed', 'world', 'live', 'others', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'otherwise', 'reason', 'be', 'content', 'house', 'lovely', 'wife', 'loving', 'son', 'steady', 'menial', 'job', 'cynical', 'self-destructive', 'worldview', 'everything', 'world', 'can', 'bring', 'good', 'yet', 'manage', 'procreate', 'two', 'great', 'things', 'beauty', 'living', 'Grims', 'amazing', 'poet', 'kindly', 'intelligent', 'son', 'end', 'Henry', 'provided', 'choice', 'run', 'troubles', 'always', 'done', 'face', 'music', 'be', 'mensch', 'choose', 'question', 'Hartley', 'rest', 'quirky', 'bumpy', 'film.While', 'good', 'show', 'Henry', 'Fool', 'not', 'as', 'engaging', 'Trust', 'as', 'offbeat', 'Amateur', 'However', 'still', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'Forget', 'over-wraught', 'analytical', 'nonsense', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'spewed', 'instead', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'can', 'recognize', 'Henry', 'Fool', 'life']",N/A

Perhaps this is in fact part of the ethos of Hartley's film making--to keep the audience slightly frustrated. If you're reading this review, it's probably redundant to point out that Hal Hartley is clearly a gifted film maker, but those gifts are clearly displayed here.One of Hartley's greatest gifts as a writer is his ability to portray even the most exaggeratedly flawed characters as pathetic (in the old sense of the word--evoking pathos in the audience). Nearly everyone in this film is lonely and quietly desperate, and perhaps it is Hartley's refusal to resolve this in his characters that makes this film so frustrating. The only emotional outlets he allows his characters in this movie are the two manuscripts of Simon and Henry, both written on screen, but never given a voice, so that, while they are commented on, are never shared with the audience, so as a result they tantalyze the audience but ultimately conceal more than they reveal about these two men.The film is very absorbing, but also kind of keeps you at arm's length.

The focus here is on Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan), a passionate individual just released from prison after seven years, and one Simon Grimm (James Urbaniak), a simple  garbageman with a seemingly apathetic view of the world in which he lives.  Henry rents a room in Simon's house (which is occupied as well by his  mother and sister) where he continues to work on his ""confession,"" the  memoir he began in prison, which is actually a treatise on life that he  believes will one day shake the world to it's very foundation.  Expounding  his passions to Simon, Henry urges him to cast off the shackles of his  dreary existence and to express himself by writing down what he feels in  the journal he gives him. Henry becomes the mentor, awakening something  within Simon long dormant and as yet unrealized.  Simon begins writing  poetry, while at the same time we begin to see another side of Henry, a man  unable to heed his own advice and whose quest for the life he seeks is too  often derailed by his own indecisiveness and uncontrollable lusts.  Ultimately, we realize that Henry and Simon are not so different from one  another after all.  Hartley's style bears a distinct signature, in that  when his characters speak it is more than simply dialogue; it is small  philosophies delivered in a mannered cadence that is engrossing and at  times mesmerizing.  The supporting cast includes Parker Posey (Simon's  sister), Maria Porter, and one of the finest character actors spawned by  independent film in recent years, Kevin Corrigan.

I'm not sure what it was, but the filmed sucked me in. There are some scenes that are fairly shocking (Faye and Henry consummating their relationship as Simon finds his and Faye's mother lying dead in the bathtub). However, the scenes are filmed in such a way that they don't seem as horrifying as they would be in real life. The film addresses some big issues, e.g. what is the nature of an artist? It also has a delightful cast, contains some extremely intelligent and witty dialogue, and has a great score. The best thing I can say about the film is that I hadn't seen the whole movie when I purchased the video and after watching all of HENRY FOOL, decided I liked the movie enough to keep it.",4,Intriguing,1036022400,"10 31, 2002",2002,792,"['first', 'saw', 'part', 'HENRY', 'FOOL', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'Independent', 'Film', 'Channel', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'filmed', 'sucked', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'fairly', 'shocking', 'Faye', 'Henry', 'consummating', 'relationship', 'Simon', 'Faye', 'mother', 'lying', 'dead', 'bathtub', 'However', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'such', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'horrifying', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'big', 'issues', 'e.g', 'what', 'nature', 'artist', 'also', 'delightful', 'cast', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'great', 'score', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'whole', 'movie', 'when', 'purchased', 'video', 'watching', 'HENRY', 'FOOL', 'decided', 'liked', 'movie', 'enough', 'keep']",N/A
