I'm a Denis Leary fan, and was interested to see how Leary performed in the role of an Irish thug type.  It's a fitting role for Leary.  He was properly cast as Bobby, a small time car thief.  Leary excelled at the role, coming off as very authentic.  I agree with the other reviewer who said Leary doesn't have to play piss and moan roles to shine.The movie has a couple slow spots, but it's a good mobster story nonetheless.",4,A great role for Leary in &quot;Monument Avenue&quot;,1077580800,"02 24, 2004",2004,465,"['bought', 'Monument', 'Avenue', 'whim', ""'m"", 'Denis', 'Leary', 'fan', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'Leary', 'performed', 'role', 'Irish', 'thug', 'type', 'fitting', 'role', 'Leary', 'was', 'properly', 'cast', 'Bobby', 'small', 'time', 'car', 'thief', 'Leary', 'excelled', 'role', 'coming', 'off', 'very', 'authentic', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'Leary', ""n't"", 'have', 'play', 'piss', 'moan', 'roles', 'shine.The', 'movie', 'couple', 'slow', 'spots', 'good', 'mobster', 'story', 'nonetheless']",N/A

Leary is a coke-addicted car thief from Charlestown who rolls with his gang of buddies including his cousin from Ireland, a cab driver, a fellow car theif, and a goofy Irish bigit-type.The film is very dark at times but there is a lot of humor as well as Leary adds some very funny stuff. This film is one of my personal favorites. It really showcases Denis Leary as the excellent actor that he can be offered the right role. This is pretty much the Irish equivalent of films such as Mean Streets.",5,Monument Ave. Review,1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,583,"['Monument', 'Ave.', 'excellent', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'what', 'one', 'call', 'upliftng', 'Leary', 'coke-addicted', 'car', 'thief', 'Charlestown', 'who', 'gang', 'buddies', 'including', 'cousin', 'Ireland', 'cab', 'driver', 'fellow', 'car', 'theif', 'goofy', 'Irish', 'bigit-type.The', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'times', 'lot', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'Leary', 'very', 'funny', 'stuff', 'film', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites', 'really', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'excellent', 'actor', 'can', 'be', 'offered', 'right', 'role', 'pretty', 'much', 'Irish', 'equivalent', 'films', 'such', 'Mean', 'Streets']",N/A
81775,A3BDUENAVB467I,0788815709,"John Capute ""JCap""","[4, 5]","If you've watched Rescue Me over the last couple years or seen The Job, you know the typical Denis Leary character: tough, profane, ethically and morally challenged, funny as hell, smarter than those around him but never as smart as thinks he is, and deep down, knows it, and always waiting for the roof to collapse on him, as he knows it eventually will, for he is no idiot though he acts like one 70% of the time.  Leary, to me, is one of the best things on television, as is Rescue Me, clearly the equal of the great HBO shows and other FX notables like The Shield.  If you appreciate Leary and the dark, tragic yet often comic sensibility he lends to Rescue Me, it would be worth your while to check out Monument Ave. Based on positive reviews in the NY Times and the New Yorker, I saw it on the big screen when it came out in 1998 along with about three other people in the theatre.  Not surprisingly it disappeared in a week and is rarely mentioned when critics talk about great crime films, particularly crime films of the post Mean Streets type, a film that clearly was an influence on Monument Ave.  And that might be because, like Rescue Me and The Job and Leary's other great film, also made by Ted Demme, The Ref, Monument Ave. pretends to be something it really isn't, in this case a Scorsese like genre piece.  But at heart really more of a contemporary tragedy closer in spirit to something like Mystic River than Mean Streets and all the clones that film and Reservoir Dogs created. Monument Ave. has a plot of sorts--will Bobby, the small time car thief Leary plays, turn  on his boss Jackie played by Colm Meany who has everyone around him terrorized into silence as his henchmen kill anyone who crosses him, leaving a host of grieving mothers in their wake. For Bobby this betrayal would mean going against a code of silence that has ruled his neighborhood--insular, parochial Charlestown, MA, fifteen minutes from downtown Boston but for Bobby and the rest of the characters, townies all, a thousand miles away for all  intents and purposes--and his life.  So in effect, as all tragedies, are, Monument Ave. is a morality play, where to do the right thing means going against all your culture and society has said is correct.  Monument Ave. is a small film, one that appropriately enough airs every so often IFC, and has all the strengths that can come with a small film. Excellent performances by a strong cast, Leary in particular, but also Ian Hart, probably best known for playing John Lennon in both The Hours and The Times and Backbeat, Famke Janssen showing probably for the first time that she was not simply eye candy, and in one of his first screen roles, Billy Cruddup. Monument Ave. is no Chinatown or even Mean Streets, its aspirations and intents are much smaller, more economical, but as a finely tuned portrait of an imperfect character coming to some moral stance, one that carries consequences he could never envision, this is a film well worth seeing.",4,"overlooked, underrated little crime gem",1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,2990,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'seen', 'Job', 'know', 'typical', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'character', 'tough', 'profane', 'ethically', 'morally', 'challenged', 'funny', 'hell', 'smarter', 'never', 'as', 'smart', 'thinks', 'deep', 'down', 'always', 'waiting', 'roof', 'collapse', 'eventually', 'will', 'idiot', 'one', '70', '%', 'time', 'Leary', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'television', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'clearly', 'equal', 'great', 'HBO', 'shows', 'other', 'FX', 'notables', 'Shield', 'appreciate', 'Leary', 'dark', 'tragic', 'yet', 'often', 'comic', 'sensibility', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'would', 'be', 'check', 'out', 'Monument', 'Ave.', 'Based', 'positive', 'reviews', 'NY', 'Times', 'New', 'Yorker', 'saw', 'big', 'screen', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1998', 'three', 'other', 'people', 'theatre', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'disappeared', 'week', 'rarely', 'mentioned', 'when', 'critics', 'talk', 'great', 'crime', 'films', 'particularly', 'crime', 'films', 'post', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'type', 'film', 'clearly', 'was', 'influence', 'Monument', 'Ave.', 'might', 'be', 'because', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'Job', 'Leary', 'other', 'great', 'film', 'also', 'made', 'Ted', 'Demme', 'Ref', 'Monument', 'Ave.', 'be', 'something', 'really', ""n't"", 'case', 'Scorsese', 'genre', 'piece', 'heart', 'really', 'more', 'contemporary', 'tragedy', 'closer', 'spirit', 'something', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'clones', 'film', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'created', 'Monument', 'Ave.', 'plot', 'sorts', 'will', 'Bobby', 'small', 'time', 'car', 'thief', 'Leary', 'plays', 'turn', 'boss', 'Jackie', 'played', 'Colm', 'Meany', 'who', 'everyone', 'terrorized', 'silence', 'henchmen', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'leaving', 'host', 'grieving', 'mothers', 'wake', 'Bobby', 'betrayal', 'would', 'mean', 'going', 'code', 'silence', 'ruled', 'neighborhood', 'insular', 'parochial', 'Charlestown', 'MA', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'downtown', 'Boston', 'Bobby', 'rest', 'characters', 'townies', 'thousand', 'miles', 'away', 'intents', 'purposes', 'life', 'So', 'effect', 'tragedies', 'are', 'Monument', 'Ave.', 'morality', 'play', 'where', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'going', 'culture', 'society', 'said', 'correct', 'Monument', 'Ave.', 'small', 'film', 'one', 'appropriately', 'enough', 'airs', 'so', 'often', 'IFC', 'strengths', 'can', 'come', 'small', 'film', 'Excellent', 'performances', 'strong', 'cast', 'Leary', 'particular', 'also', 'Ian', 'Hart', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Hours', 'Times', 'Backbeat', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'showing', 'probably', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'simply', 'eye', 'candy', 'one', 'first', 'screen', 'roles', 'Billy', 'Cruddup', 'Monument', 'Ave.', 'Chinatown', 'even', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'aspirations', 'intents', 'are', 'much', 'smaller', 'more', 'economical', 'finely', 'tuned', 'portrait', 'imperfect', 'character', 'coming', 'moral', 'stance', 'one', 'consequences', 'could', 'never', 'envision', 'film', 'well', 'seeing']",N/A

I suppose, due to my past life I never tire of watching guys sitting around partying and discussing pointless, banal topics with fervor and passion fueled by drugs and camaraderie. I'm getting to relive my youth vicariously sans the bad health and police issues. The plot was basic enough. Vaguely gang related but in the old school way of the Irish.

81781,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,0788815709,Pork Chop,"[1, 4]","MONUMENT AVE (aka SNITCH 1998), is somewhat of a chick-flick in amasculine version, telling a story of a number of youths all from thesame neighborhood, who somehow escaped the radar screen of lawenforcement. This is said to stem from from the incompetence of theconstable, his being on the take, or from looking the other way dueto his shared ethnicity (Irish-Americans, Martin Sheen) with theother  delinquent elements.The lead characters, among them Denis Leary, Kevin Chapman somehowwind up at between 30 and 40 years of age, in almost an identicalspot as  when they were youths growing up together, rejecting  the 9 to5 routine, in favor of a constant presence in pubs, drinking, highon cocaine, whiskey, gambling, without having learned a trade orprofession.They agree to defraud an insurer with a simulated theft of luxuryautomobiles in some cases, and in others, sell those for parts aspart of a car ring on the East Coast of the USA.The easy life, and excess familiarity with their own neighborhoods,leads this gang to unrealistic expectactions in regards to theirability to stop the hands of time and the winds of change, in termsof their own neighborhood in the city  from when they were kids,fearing housing projects and other communities from setting shop in it.In regards to business, the ring leader admits taking out a number ofwell known community members over the years, to eliminate any and allrisks of informants to the police and any challenge to his leadershipposition.Surprisingly, this microcosm  in which they sustain themselvesstays unchanged over a period of years, until the skeletons seem toomany, the truth too hideous to remain hidden in the closet. At theirage, the cognitive dissonance between right and wrong and theexpectations of their boss,  grows too large to reconcile, such that adesire to break free from this scene grows increasingly irresistable.The overwhelming experience of this movie, is the skill of thedirector  underplaying his presence, by almost totally eliminatingmusic, special effects, cinematic inventions, by sticking to asimplicity, and a low-key presence of the cameras. The action as itunfolds feels authentic to the viewers, with the actors offeringrealistic performances, in a movie that  appears stronglyautobiographical in nature.The weak point, is obviously the lack of consequences and pain felt bythe ring members from their actions, the easiness of theirlifestyles, and excess pleasure they seem to partake in, as well asthe astonishingly absent moral reflections, repercussions, analysisof their gestures.
