It was indeed a bargain with the devil -- and do you dare to trust the devil? Several reviewers said it was totally unrealistic but I disagree. Goering and Himmler both made such ""offers"" to extremely wealthy jews, offers they couldn't refuse, in the words of the Godfather. While awaiting trial at Nuremberg, Karl Donitz overheard Herman Goering complaining that he had ""more to lose"" than his fellow imprisoned NAZIs. Donitz replied, ""Yes, and most of it stolen.""  Goering and Himmler confiscated great amounts of art, but you can be sure when they couldn't simply ""take"" what they wanted, they forced various extremely wealthy jews to sign over their business enterprises, legally, dotting every i and crossing every t, in exchange for their lives, for the NAZIs held that kind of power.  Yet even the highest ranking NAZIs were forced to recognize the power of the pen, and the necessity of legal signatures, in some cases.  But it must be said that the SS & SA attempted wholesale slaughter of everyone who was anyone in Poland in 1939. Their goal was to wipe out all the gentry, officials, clergy, and aristocracy in Poland and turn Poland into part of greater Germania.  Even wealthy Poles were not able to ""Project Europa"" their way out of the SS-Einsatzgruppen firing squads. Project Europa did not exist that early in the war. And while Himmler later used it to line his pockets, Adolf Eichmann did his best to quash Project Europa and continue the ""Final Solution"" his mentor Reinhard Heydrich helped shape at The Wannsee Conference in Berlin.  Another eye-opening movie, ""Conspiracy,"" stars Kenneth Branagh & Stanley Tucci as Heydrich and Eichmann.  The guy from ""The King's Speech"" is in it as well.

1033032,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000KB48NE,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","Despite the fact that there have been many good films about the Holocaust, the Nazi manipulated genocide of the Jews in World War II, there is enough room for a new perspective to that hideous period in history to make THE COUPLE a welcome addition to the repertoire. Written by Director John Daly based on a story by Kendrew Lascelles this film reveals a little known bit of history that shows that the Nazis allowed the wealthy Jews to 'buy their freedom and lives' at enormous losses. And the key Nazi, at least in this story, is none other than Himmler.Joseph Krauzenberg (Martin Landau) is a very wealthy German Jewish industrial tycoon whose fortune is mirrored in his palaces that are more like museums of great art. But in the year 1944 his important steel mills and other major industries are needed by the Nazis and so a plan is hatched to offer Krauzenberg, his wife Rachel (Judy Parfitt) and his considerable family the opportunity to escape death by allowing them to leave Germany for Switzerland and ultimately for Palestine. The only servants the Krauzenbergs maintain are the Vassmans - Ingrid (Caroline Carver) and Hans (Kenny Doughty) - an Aryan couple who in reality work for the Underground and are actually Jews under strong cover.Eichmann (Steven Mackintosh) and Himmler (Danny Webb) are perpetrating the plan to gain all of the wealth and lands and homes and art of the Krauzenbergs and they attend a dinner party at the Krauzenberg palace to sign the final papers. One of the other officers Edelhein (Christopher Fulford) is the most repulsive of the group and despite the fact that Ingrid Vassman is pregnant, Edelhein pursues her as a perfect foil for implanting his precious seed in the 'Aryan beauty' to populate the new Germany. As the night of transaction occurs Krauzenberg visits his large family being held by Eichmann in the Gestapo and reassures them that all will be safe. The Vassmans love the Krauzenbergs and ultimately confess that they are Jewish and wish to escape to Palestine with the Krauzenbergs. In a fast paced finale the trials and tribulations of the final plan are worked through in a somewhat surprising way.THE COUPLE is beautifully photographed (the film was shot in Poland despite the fact that the Krauzenberg estates were in Hungary) and the mood of evil is always present in the night scenes with the requisite searchlights penetrating the darkness. Laudau and Parfitt are strong as are Webb, Mackintosh and Fulford. Neither Caroline Carver nor Kenny Doughty is up to the task of making the Couple credible. But the overall impact of the film is the focus of the evil that drove the Nazi machine, even with this slight bit of human kindness that was bestowed on the Krauzenberg family at such an awful cost.

Edge Jr. ""Happy Traveler""","[9, 11]","Set during the Holocaust in Nazi Germany, the plot is about the twists, turns and challenges of a wealthy Jewish industrialist's efforts to ""buy"" the lives of his family from the Nazis.  The range of emotion expressed by Martin Landau's face should have won him an Academy Award nomination, in my opinion.  I felt that the other actors did a fine job as well.

1033043,A1AQ9R3L8ZWWEC,B000KB48NE,"LMG ""ancient art prof""","[2, 3]","This was a superb underrated film that deserved to be seen by a far larger audience than it actually attracted. As the wealthy patriarch of his family and a most decent man, Martin Landau portrays an Hungarian Jew, Joseph Krauzenberg, who uses his fortune to buy off the voracious Heinrich Himmler in exchange for the freedom of said family. Tension constantly builds throughout the movie as the tradeoff unfolds in the shadow of surrounding death, the even more predatory Eichmann, and the sexual desires of a German officer who covets the wife of ""the couple"" who are the Krauzenbergs' long time servants and claim to be Aryan but are in fact Jewish - a revelation that even takes Landau and his wife, deliciously played by Judy Parfitt, by surprise.  Will the deal go through?  Will ""the couple"" also be saved? Will there be a double cross?  Suspense coupled with an unexpected twist should keep the viewer on the edge of his seat. Furthermore, the characters depicted are not one-dimensional.  This is what adds so much to their heroicism or menace.  Nothing can be taken for granted in Nazi Germany.  Since evil is at times masked in an outwardly handsome appearance and trappings along with hypocritical and false morality only makes one recoil all the more. The scene where Eichmann is commanded by Himmler to kiss the hand of Parfitt in the face of their mutual despise and distaste is worth the price of admission. An earlier expletive from Parfitt re the Nazis also demands applause for the lady. The food taster brings his own touch to the mix. It would be unfair to give any more away but something else needs to be said about the magnificent film score by Igor Khoroshev. His music for me was almost on a par with that of John Williams' ""Schindler's List"". Yet, a separate CD audio recording of this excellent and moving score was never made.

Of course, it helped that the particular Jews in this movie were very wealthy and could buy their way out of a concentration camp and even save their servants, aka &#34;the couple&#34;, who were not what they claimed to be, at the last minute.

I collect militaria, I reenact both WWI and WWII impressions, and I am very picky about movies for historical accuracy and getting things ""right.""  When I picked up ""The Couple"" I expected it to be a rather typical Holocaust movie.  To the lightweight historian, it likely is, but to those of us who are seriously into Third Reich history, this is an amazingly well done film.  Whomever their historical advisor was, he was extremely well versed in uniforms and equipment.  The little things in the background jumped out at me and it was stuff I haven't seen in a lot of ""big"" budget films.I won't go into the story itself, it's very good and the plot is very well developed throughout.  It deals with Himmler's interactions with wealthy Jews who bought their way out of the Holocaust.  This did occur on numerous occasions, but I believe this particular story is largely fabricated.  All that aside, the story is entirely plausible and accurate to how these arrangements were conducted.  The fellow playing Himmler was perhaps just a touch too aggressive, but only at times - overall, I think he did a great job of portraying Himmler.This is one of the only movies I've seen that sheds light on the tension that existed between Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Eichmann.  In truth, after the death of Heydrich, Eichmann and Himmler were increasingly at odds with each other, especially in the later stages of the war.  Also illustrated is the general contempt and distrust between members officers of the SS and of the SD.  This leads to a very nice ending scene.What impressed me most about this film, and this may seem trivial but it's big to me, is that they got the uniforms right!  That hardly ever happens.  The guys manning gates and checkpoints are Shutzpolizei troops, the ""heavies"" are SD guys, the less-heavies are SS guys.  There are Reichsbahn uniforms on the train guys, scenes with teens wearing correct HJ uniforms (even their leader has a correct uniform), feldgendarmerie troops milling about with regular Heer guys, you name it!  Extremely impressive to me, and again something I've NEVER seen in any other movie, the German officers on the borders are wearing the correct Customs Officers uniforms - whoa!  I know, this sounds like I'm an accuracy geek, but I am, sorry.The only down side to the movie is that it's a British production and all the Germans speak with a British accent!

Excellent script, casting, acting - everything is top notch.This begins with true footage of some of the horrors of a Nazi death camp...the barracks, the suitcases, the overwhelming piles of human bones, the ovens...and the enormous crowds of Jews being loaded onto the railcars like cattle - separated from their babies etc. On their way to Auschwitz.  This movie grabs you from the very beginning and holds you in its grip to the very end.Set in Hungary (1944) - Joseph Krausenberg, owner of Krausenberg Industries, is an extremely wealthy Jewish man, who was a beloved member of the community before the Nazi's started their war on Jews, and he employed thousands. He also owned a house in town and a mansion in the country filled to the brim with a vast art collection etc.Krausenberg is very well aware of what goes on in the death camps and fears for the lives of himself and his extended family.Aware that another weathy person they knew has already tried this, and ended up being killed. He carefully makes a deal with Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler personally, to sign over all he owns and transfer his Swiss bank accounts to him, for the safe passage of all his family to Switzerland and on to Palestine, and also the safety of all the Aryans still employed at his company and the Aryan couple on his estate.After many months of negotiations and paperwork everything seems to be set to go - but on the slightest whim of Himmler, they could all be dead in a moment (or suffer being sent to Auschwitz).  And as they are packing their bag to be taken to the airport (IF things go as promised), the young Aryan couple that works for them spills the secret they are really Jewish and working for the resistance and beg to go with them.  But it's too late, the deal has already been made, legal papers signed and arrangements done.  And worse, one of the high-ranking officials has a SERIOUS case of lust for the ""Aryan"" woman to be his the moment after the deal is finished - and he goes to great lengths not to be denied.The terror, the suspense, the racial hatred etc. is all VERY palpable, very real throughout the movie. Your heart will be in your throat as you watch this all unfold and pray with them, that they escape.This movie was EXTREMELY WELL DONE by everyone involved (writers, directors, actors, the German Shepherds, casting, wardrobe, hair/makeup, set, cameramen, lighting etc.) and if you are interested in watching a movie on the subject, but OUTSIDE of the camps - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE.*****The (1) possible flaw I noted in this film was that in the vehicles, the steering wheel was on the left side as we have in the States, and not on the right side I believe is common for Europe.

It is a story set during WWII in Hungary where a young German couple is serving a wealthy Jewish man on his estate in the countryside.  The premise of the story is that child-free wealthy man and his wife are using all of their assets to buy freedom for their extended family.It is a story about value of family, strength of Jewish spirit, one German soldier's word and our innate power for survival.

Aside from the question of authenticity, there are other flaws such as stilted acting by some of the cast, and less than stellar production details. The story is set during WW II in Hungary, the year is 1944, significant because it was the period when massive deportations of Hungarian Jews was conducted by the Nazis as part of their Final Solution. These Jews were mostly deported to the extermination camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau, where most of them were murdered.The central characters in this movie are a young Aryan couple, Hans and Ingrid Vassman (played by Kenny Douhgty and Caroline Carver) who work for a rich Jewish industrialist Joseph Krauzenberg and his wife, Rachel (played by Martin Landau and Judith Parfitt). Joseph is desperate to save his extended family who are under threat of deportation and in the process of being rounded up by the Gestapo. He appeals to the high-ranking Nazi officers, and is promised exemption from deportation and escape out of Hungary, in exchange for almost all of his fortune. There are some tense moments but Joseph gets the assurance he seeks, but there's one complication - the `Aryan' couple turn out to be Jews and they too need safe passage out of Hungary. Will Joseph help them, or is it too late?Landau and Parfitt are credible in their roles as the patriarch and matriarch of a large Jewish family, and a prominent one at that. The young Jewish couple are ok in their performances, but not as credible in their roles. The story has its suspenseful moments, and does keep viewers on edge, so this was a plus factor in viewing this movie. However, there are historically inaccurate portrayals that detracted from my overall enjoyment of the movie. One is the implication that Krauzenberg and his family were given safe passage out of Hungary under the Europa Plan. This plan was actually begun by a group of Slovakian Jews under the leadership of Rabbi Weissmandel, with the aim of bribing the Germans so that the deportation of the Jews would be halted. To cut a long story short, the plan was a failure. Hence, in this movie, the Krauzenbergs' escape under such a plan is pure fiction.Despite this and other flaws, the movie makes for an engaging watch, and for those who love Holocaust-based dramas, I'd like to recommend the following titles (I'm leaving out known classics such as Schindler's List and The Pianist as many are familiar with these movies) :UprisingOut of the AshesAu Revoir Les Enfants [VHS]AmenEuropa EuropaThe Island on Bird StreetSunshineConspiracyThe Devil's ArithmeticFatelessGood Evening, Mr. Wallenberg",3,"Engaging, but has its flaws",1169769600,"01 26, 2007",2007,2738,"['As', 'far', 'Holocaust', 'dramas', 'go', 'Couple', 'viewer', 'attention', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'Holocaust', 'movies', 'listed', 'made', 'Aside', 'question', 'authenticity', 'are', 'other', 'flaws', 'such', 'stilted', 'acting', 'cast', 'less', 'stellar', 'production', 'details', 'story', 'set', 'WW', 'II', 'Hungary', 'year', '1944', 'significant', 'was', 'period', 'when', 'massive', 'deportations', 'Hungarian', 'Jews', 'was', 'conducted', 'Nazis', 'part', 'Final', 'Solution', 'Jews', 'were', 'mostly', 'deported', 'extermination', 'camps', 'such', 'Auschwitz-Birkenau', 'where', 'most', 'were', 'murdered.The', 'central', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'young', 'Aryan', 'couple', 'Hans', 'Ingrid', 'Vassman', 'played', 'Kenny', 'Douhgty', 'Caroline', 'Carver', 'who', 'work', 'rich', 'Jewish', 'industrialist', 'Joseph', 'Krauzenberg', 'wife', 'Rachel', 'played', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Judith', 'Parfitt', 'Joseph', 'desperate', 'save', 'extended', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'threat', 'deportation', 'process', 'being', 'rounded', 'up', 'Gestapo', 'appeals', 'high-ranking', 'Nazi', 'officers', 'promised', 'exemption', 'deportation', 'escape', 'Hungary', 'exchange', 'almost', 'fortune', 'are', 'tense', 'moments', 'Joseph', 'assurance', 'one', 'complication', 'Aryan', 'couple', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Jews', 'too', 'need', 'safe', 'passage', 'Hungary', 'Will', 'Joseph', 'help', 'too', 'late', 'Landau', 'Parfitt', 'are', 'credible', 'roles', 'patriarch', 'matriarch', 'large', 'Jewish', 'family', 'prominent', 'one', 'young', 'Jewish', 'couple', 'are', 'ok', 'performances', 'not', 'credible', 'roles', 'story', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'keep', 'viewers', 'edge', 'was', 'plus', 'factor', 'viewing', 'movie', 'However', 'are', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'portrayals', 'detracted', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'One', 'implication', 'Krauzenberg', 'family', 'were', 'given', 'safe', 'passage', 'Hungary', 'Europa', 'Plan', 'plan', 'was', 'actually', 'begun', 'group', 'Slovakian', 'Jews', 'leadership', 'Rabbi', 'Weissmandel', 'aim', 'bribing', 'Germans', 'so', 'deportation', 'Jews', 'would', 'be', 'halted', 'cut', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'plan', 'was', 'failure', 'Hence', 'movie', 'Krauzenbergs', 'escape', 'plan', 'pure', 'fiction.Despite', 'other', 'flaws', 'movie', 'engaging', 'watch', 'who', 'love', 'Holocaust-based', 'dramas', ""'d"", 'like', 'recommend', 'following', 'titles', ""'m"", 'leaving', 'out', 'known', 'classics', 'such', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Pianist', 'many', 'are', 'familiar', 'movies', 'UprisingOut', 'AshesAu', 'Revoir', 'Les', 'Enfants', '[', 'VHS', ']', 'AmenEuropa', 'EuropaThe', 'Island', 'Bird', 'StreetSunshineConspiracyThe', 'Devil', 'ArithmeticFatelessGood', 'Evening', 'Mr.', 'Wallenberg']",N/A
