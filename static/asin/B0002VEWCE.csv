One of them gets captured, and then it turns into some kind of ""Altered States"" heist movie.Seems our Activists are now set on freeing their captured comrade from the lab where he has become the focus of a new experiment that is gradually stripping away his humanity in a ""Lawnmower Man"" kind of way.Sounds cool, right? That's what I thought. The problem is that once the heist portion of the movie starts, it goes nowhere fast. There's a lot of pointless screaming as members of the crew start turning on each other. It's another entry into the current string of U.K. funded programming that features people turning on each other. For more of the same, watch ""The Bunker"". The Bad Guy doesn't make an appearance until the last ten minutes of the movie, and it's a pretty dull ride up to that point.",1,Lethally Dull,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,959,"['premise', 'movie', 'seemingly', 'solid', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Animal', 'Rights', 'Activists', 'break', 'lab', 'free', 'cute', 'fuzzy', 'bunnies', 'One', 'captured', 'then', 'kind', 'Altered', 'States', 'heist', 'Activists', 'are', 'now', 'set', 'freeing', 'captured', 'comrade', 'lab', 'where', 'become', 'focus', 'new', 'experiment', 'gradually', 'stripping', 'away', 'humanity', 'Lawnmower', 'Man', 'kind', 'way.Sounds', 'cool', 'right', 'what', 'thought', 'problem', 'once', 'heist', 'portion', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'lot', 'pointless', 'screaming', 'members', 'crew', 'start', 'turning', 'other', 'entry', 'current', 'string', 'U.K.', 'funded', 'programming', 'people', 'turning', 'other', 'more', 'same', 'watch', 'Bunker', 'Bad', 'Guy', ""n't"", 'make', 'appearance', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'pretty', 'dull', 'ride', 'up', 'point']",Lethal Dose

847015,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0002VEWCE,Michael Butts,"[5, 5]","LETHAL DOSE is one of those scifi flicks that in its attempts to be esoteric and ""original,"" it gives the audience no real clue as to what exactly is going on and therefore loses any impact it might have had.  A group of seven young animal activists break into a laboratory to free all the animals.  One of their men is trapped in a bear trap and they are forced to leave him behind in order for the organization to continue.  A year later, we find that the young man caught has been sentenced to three years in prison.  Via a confusing e-mail, the other six activists are reunited.  One of the members visits the imprisoned Gary and finds out that he has volunteered to participate in some kind of experiment, obviously a very hush hush one.  The friends decide to break into the isolated lab and rescue Gary, picking up a couple of new enlistees on the way, one of them a seemingly psychotic ex-marine.  Once they infiltrate the research facility, however, they find themselves locked in and virtual prisoners of someone or something.  They start dying one by one, and its up to the remaining group to find out just what the heck is going on.From thereon, the plot ricochets off the walls, never becoming coherent, and one is left to wonder just what the experiment's goal was, and what happened to Gary...really.While there are some atmospheric elements and a few jolts of suspense, the movie descends into such ridiculous territory, one scratches their head and says WHAT WAS THIS ALL ABOUT.Avoid unless you're into Rubix cubes.",1,LETHAL DOZE,1109894400,"03 4, 2005",2005,1532,"['LETHAL', 'DOSE', 'one', 'scifi', 'flicks', 'attempts', 'be', 'esoteric', 'original', 'audience', 'real', 'clue', 'what', 'exactly', 'going', 'therefore', 'impact', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'A', 'group', 'seven', 'young', 'animal', 'activists', 'break', 'laboratory', 'free', 'animals', 'One', 'men', 'trapped', 'bear', 'trap', 'are', 'forced', 'leave', 'behind', 'order', 'organization', 'continue', 'year', 'later', 'find', 'young', 'man', 'caught', 'been', 'sentenced', 'three', 'years', 'prison', 'Via', 'confusing', 'e-mail', 'other', 'six', 'activists', 'are', 'reunited', 'One', 'members', 'imprisoned', 'Gary', 'out', 'volunteered', 'participate', 'kind', 'experiment', 'obviously', 'very', 'hush', 'hush', 'one', 'friends', 'decide', 'break', 'isolated', 'lab', 'rescue', 'Gary', 'picking', 'up', 'couple', 'new', 'enlistees', 'way', 'one', 'seemingly', 'psychotic', 'ex-marine', 'infiltrate', 'research', 'facility', 'however', 'find', 'locked', 'virtual', 'prisoners', 'someone', 'something', 'start', 'dying', 'one', 'one', 'up', 'remaining', 'group', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'heck', 'going', 'thereon', 'plot', 'walls', 'never', 'becoming', 'coherent', 'one', 'left', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'experiment', 'goal', 'was', 'what', 'happened', 'Gary', 'really.While', 'are', 'atmospheric', 'elements', 'few', 'jolts', 'suspense', 'movie', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'territory', 'one', 'head', 'WHAT', 'WAS', 'THIS', 'ALL', 'ABOUT.Avoid', ""'re"", 'Rubix', 'cubes']",Lethal Dose

And what is with the one girl's hair? At first, when they are heading towards a different lab filming in the back of a van with face camo paint on, i thought her hair was a mophead attached to the hat she had on as part of a disguise. A few frames later, I realized it was her hair in blonde dread locks.She dies about an hour into this mess after she throws up on her shoes, whick is shown, and then tossed face first into a door.

847018,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0002VEWCE,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","LD 50 (Simon de Selva, 2003)Is it really possible to give a good review to any movie containing a Spice Girl? I guess nothing's out of the question, but LD 50 is not the movie that will prove this particular rule of thumb wrong. Well, okay, it's not an entirely unredeemable film, but it's certainly not going to turn ex-Spice Girl Melanie Brown into as big a movie star as she was a pop star.The film starts off with a disbanded animal rights activist group receiving a call for help from one of the former members. The others get back together to try and rescue him from the animal testing lab where he's being held prisoner, but the hunters quickly become the hunted as the owners of the lab start putting the activists through grueling mental, emotional, and ultimately physical tests. Will any of them escape?Thing is, we don't care. None of these characters has enough depth for us to invest any emotion in the outcome. It's your typical slasher film, with the only variation on the theme being that technology takes the place of the big knife. Put together a bunch of people, add a killer, and for the most part, you can throw such niceties as character development, a complex script, etc. out the window, and that's pretty much what de Selva (an actor by trade directing his first, and to date last, movie) does here. Still, there are some inventive kills, so if you're into that sort of thing and it's enough to carry a movie for you, then this should be right up your alley. Everyone else, hold out for something better. **",2,Blah.,1277251200,"06 23, 2010",2010,1533,"['50', 'Simon', 'de', 'Selva', '2003', 'really', 'possible', 'give', 'good', 'review', 'movie', 'containing', 'Spice', 'Girl', 'guess', 'nothing', 'question', 'LD', '50', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'prove', 'particular', 'rule', 'thumb', 'wrong', 'Well', 'okay', 'not', 'entirely', 'unredeemable', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'going', 'turn', 'ex-Spice', 'Girl', 'Melanie', 'Brown', 'as', 'big', 'movie', 'star', 'was', 'pop', 'star.The', 'film', 'disbanded', 'animal', 'rights', 'activist', 'group', 'receiving', 'call', 'help', 'one', 'former', 'members', 'others', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'try', 'rescue', 'animal', 'testing', 'lab', 'where', 'being', 'held', 'prisoner', 'hunters', 'quickly', 'become', 'hunted', 'owners', 'lab', 'start', 'putting', 'activists', 'grueling', 'mental', 'emotional', 'ultimately', 'physical', 'tests', 'Will', 'escape', 'Thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'None', 'characters', 'enough', 'depth', 'invest', 'emotion', 'outcome', 'typical', 'slasher', 'film', 'only', 'variation', 'theme', 'being', 'technology', 'place', 'big', 'knife', 'Put', 'together', 'bunch', 'people', 'add', 'killer', 'most', 'part', 'can', 'throw', 'such', 'niceties', 'character', 'development', 'complex', 'script', 'etc', 'out', 'window', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'Selva', 'actor', 'trade', 'directing', 'first', 'date', 'last', 'movie', 'here', 'Still', 'are', 'inventive', 'kills', 'so', ""'re"", 'sort', 'thing', 'enough', 'carry', 'movie', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'Everyone', 'else', 'hold', 'out', 'something', 'better', '**']",Lethal Dose
