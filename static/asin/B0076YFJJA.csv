Don't have to be British to love this film, (I'am not). Their is a very small amount of actual socccer in this movie. It is more about the emotional and phyisical effects of the 1958 plane crash that killed most of the very young Manchester United team. This movie is very comparable to the American ""We are Marshall"" story. The acting from David Tennant and Jack O'Donnell is over whelming. David Tennant's portrayal of Couch Jimmy Murphy, who has to bury his dead boys, and get his injured players back to England and then replace his team in less than two weeks to fulfill team obligations is just extraordinary. This is very much a film about the triumphant human will overcoming a tragic event.

What fans may find fascinating is the portrayal of European soccer at a crossroads, with the Manchester team controversially traveling to the Continent to take part in the newly-formed European Cup competition, establishing English soccer as a global force to be reckoned with. The film is beautifully shot and richly textured both visually and emotionally.

1526995,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0076YFJJA,Grady Harp,"[3, 5]","Likely if the viewer is a soccer fan and already familiar with the 1958 tragic airplane accident that resulted in the loss of lives of the majority of the Internationally famous soccer team during a blighted takeoff in Munich, this film will be profoundly affecting. Certainly the `based on true events' aspect of this film makes it affecting, especially the manner in which the citizens of Manchester responded to the deaths of their heroes and came to the fore with support for their beloved winning team. But as written by Chris Chibnall and directed by James Strong, UNITED relies too heavily on established information and fails to develop the characters portrayed by the actors to the point that the non-soccer fan audience has a difficult time identifying with the members of the team and the film plods along in a maudlin, saccharine manner that without some history of the boys on the team becomes a bit trying to watch.But as the PR states, `United is based on the true story of Manchester United's legendary ""Busby Babes"", the youngest side ever to win the Football League and the 1958 Munich Air Crash that claimed eight of the their number. The film draws on first-hand interviews with the survivors and their families to tell the inspirational story of a team and community overcoming terrible tragedy.The few team members who are allowed personality are portrayed by Sam Clafin as Duncan, Thomas Howes as the pipe smoking Mark, and Jack O'Connell as the newest member of the team Bobby (good in the first half, maudlin and weak in the second half).  The spokesman for the team is owner Matt Busby (Dougray Scott) - the team is known as Busby's Babes - and the redoubtable champion team leader Jimmy Murphy is well portrayed by David Tennant.  The hard-nosed athletic commissioner Alan Hardaker is portrayed by Neil Dudgeon.  The rest of the cat is fine but their characters are so ill-defined that it is difficult to remember who they are.Undoubtedly a sad but true story and also one of overcoming odds, but as a film for the general public without soccer connections, it is a poorly conceived movie.

The actors were very good, however the heavy British dialect made it just as hard to understand.For some reason I was led to believe that UNITED was a family movie, on this I would have to disagree.  Thankfully my 11 year old found it to be very boring.  When I caught a man yelling in despair ""We're going to get ourselves (flocking) killed here"" (insert actual foul F-word) and saw the burnt, charred, and bloody crash victims, I said it was time for bed.  This was 40 minutes into the movie.  The movie runs approx 1 hour 40 minutes. I would have to believe the images of this accident would frighten a young child and lead them to question any future plans to fly in an airplane.I continued to watch after the young eyes were alseep and found that the movie was just as boring and slow moving after the crash as it was before.

1526999,A2JFDCLA9PZGQ0,B0076YFJJA,Teemacs,"[0, 0]","I can remember the original tragedy and the devastating effect it had on football (soccer) fans around the world. I can also remember that 1958 Cup Final, when we all willed them to win, and they failed. But, as the Jimmy Murphy character says in the film, the fact that they got to Wembley Stadium at all constituted a win. Sir Bobby Charlton (as he now is) and Northern Ireland goalkeeper Harry Gregg (one of the heroes of the crash, rescuing people from the wreckage) are, I believe, now the only survivors of Munich who remain with us.Even if you're not a soccer fan, I think you will like this magnificent story, of how a fresh young team was virtually wiped out, and how coach Jimmy Murphy brought it back. It's seen principally through the eyes of Murphy and a very young Bobby Charlton (we all tend to forget that he had lots of hair back then!). It's a delightful recapture of a bygone age, when everyone (players included) smoked and Bobby Charlton being told never to tell girls that he was a professional footballer (""15 a week? Career over at 40, if you're lucky? What girl wants prospects like that? Tell them you're a carpenter or a plumber!"")Negatives? Really only the portrayal of Sir Matt Busby, who looks more like a Chicago gangster than the track-suited manager he actually was (apparently the Busby family was most upset by this portrayal).

Matt Busby was twice given the Last Rites, but they brought him back.

1527000,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0076YFJJA,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","First, let me tell you about the DVD jacket of ""United,"" a made-for-TV film (but theatrically released outside UK), broadcast on 24 April 2011 on BBC. The jacket is misleading. The film is about ""Munich air disaster"" in 1958, an airplane crash that took the lives of twenty-three people onboard including the football (soccer) players of Manchester United. Though it is about football, ""United"" does not contain any football game scenes, so if you are expecting films like ""Goal! The Dream Begins,"" you may be disappointed.To describe the tragic event, the film focuses three real-life people: Matt Busby, manager of Manchester United, who gets nearly killed in the accident (Dougray Scott); Bobby Charlton, a young football player, who after the tragedy went on to become a legend (Jack O'Connell); and Jimmy Murphy, assistant manager, who was not on the flight (David Tennant). The actors all did fine jobs (though I find Scott's Matt Busby too dark). David Tennant, ""Tenth Doctor"" of the ""Doctor Who"" series, is a real standout as Jimmy Murphy taking over the job of manager to reassemble the team.Obviously the filmmakers of ""United"" wanted their film to be as accurate as possible. It shows us many details: how Bobby Charlton was found on the ground, strapped in his seat; how some of the team members moved to the back of the plane before the fatal take-off; how goalkeeper Harry Gregg, miraculously unscathed, went back into the wreckage and saved passengers, and so on.So you might ask: why only three stars? That ""United"" does not have football scenes did not bother me. The story itself is a moving one, but I somehow didn't find myself emotionally involved in the way the story was told. Directed by British television director and writer James Strong, ""United"" is convincing as reenactment of the tragedy and the events leading up to it, but as to how the survivors reacted to the shocking event and came back to the pitch, the film just needs more time.Those who are not familiar with the football league systems in England and Europe might find some of the film's details a bit confusing, especially how the team went on to complete the season. The team ""rose from the ashes"" (if I may borrow the phrase of the tagline), but not in the dramatic way you might imagine. It took time for the team to rise again and ""United"" sticks to the fact.That is a wise decision on the part of filmmakers, who refuse to overdramatize the events, but I also think the film could have told us more about the people. Perhaps 90 minutes is too shot for that.",3,"Manchester United And ""Munich Air Disaster"" in 1958",1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,2554,"['First', 'let', 'tell', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'United', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'theatrically', 'released', 'UK', 'broadcast', '24', 'April', '2011', 'BBC', 'jacket', 'misleading', 'film', 'Munich', 'air', 'disaster', '1958', 'airplane', 'crash', 'took', 'lives', 'twenty-three', 'people', 'including', 'football', 'soccer', 'players', 'Manchester', 'United', 'football', 'United', 'not', 'contain', 'football', 'game', 'scenes', 'so', 'are', 'expecting', 'films', 'Goal', 'Dream', 'Begins', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed.To', 'describe', 'tragic', 'event', 'film', 'three', 'real-life', 'people', 'Matt', 'Busby', 'manager', 'Manchester', 'United', 'who', 'nearly', 'killed', 'accident', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'Bobby', 'Charlton', 'young', 'football', 'player', 'who', 'tragedy', 'went', 'become', 'legend', 'Jack', ""O'Connell"", 'Jimmy', 'Murphy', 'assistant', 'manager', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'flight', 'David', 'Tennant', 'actors', 'did', 'fine', 'jobs', 'find', 'Scott', 'Matt', 'Busby', 'too', 'dark', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Tenth', 'Doctor', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'real', 'standout', 'Jimmy', 'Murphy', 'taking', 'over', 'job', 'manager', 'reassemble', 'team.Obviously', 'filmmakers', 'United', 'wanted', 'film', 'be', 'as', 'accurate', 'possible', 'many', 'details', 'how', 'Bobby', 'Charlton', 'was', 'found', 'ground', 'strapped', 'seat', 'how', 'team', 'members', 'moved', 'back', 'plane', 'fatal', 'take-off', 'how', 'goalkeeper', 'Harry', 'Gregg', 'miraculously', 'unscathed', 'went', 'back', 'wreckage', 'saved', 'passengers', 'so', 'on.So', 'might', 'ask', 'why', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'United', 'not', 'have', 'football', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'story', 'moving', 'one', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'Directed', 'British', 'television', 'director', 'writer', 'James', 'Strong', 'United', 'convincing', 'reenactment', 'tragedy', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'how', 'survivors', 'reacted', 'shocking', 'event', 'came', 'back', 'pitch', 'film', 'just', 'more', 'time.Those', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'football', 'league', 'systems', 'England', 'Europe', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'details', 'bit', 'confusing', 'especially', 'how', 'team', 'went', 'complete', 'season', 'team', 'rose', 'ashes', 'may', 'borrow', 'phrase', 'tagline', 'not', 'dramatic', 'way', 'might', 'imagine', 'took', 'time', 'team', 'rise', 'again', 'United', 'sticks', 'fact.That', 'wise', 'decision', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'refuse', 'overdramatize', 'events', 'also', 'think', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'more', 'people', 'Perhaps', '90', 'minutes', 'too', 'shot']",United

Nine players (2 of whom never played again) and coach Matt Busby survived. This movie begins with that event and tells the story of rebuilding a club whose key leaders, players, and fans were all shaken to their core. Coach Busby had to rebuild with only 7 of his squad. Among those who survived was Bobby Charlton, a young United star. The movie focuses a lot on Bobby's struggle with whether or not to play again and the broader effort by Busby to recruit a new team. You see the great leadership of Busby and the resilience of Charlton, the goalkeeper Harry Gregg and other survivors, in the rebuilding effort. It's a fantastic story. As a United fan, I was delighted to see how this event shaped the resilience, strength, confidence, and work ethic that exists at the club today.",5,The greatness that is MUFC begins here,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,878,"['early', '1958', '8', 'Manchester', 'United', 'players', '3', 'staff', 'were', 'killed', 'Munich', 'Air', 'Disaster', 'Nine', 'players', '2', 'whom', 'never', 'played', 'again', 'coach', 'Matt', 'Busby', 'survived', 'movie', 'event', 'story', 'rebuilding', 'club', 'key', 'leaders', 'players', 'fans', 'were', 'shaken', 'core', 'Coach', 'Busby', 'had', 'rebuild', 'only', '7', 'squad', 'who', 'survived', 'was', 'Bobby', 'Charlton', 'young', 'United', 'star', 'movie', 'lot', 'Bobby', 'struggle', 'not', 'play', 'again', 'broader', 'effort', 'Busby', 'recruit', 'new', 'team', 'see', 'great', 'leadership', 'Busby', 'resilience', 'Charlton', 'goalkeeper', 'Harry', 'Gregg', 'other', 'survivors', 'rebuilding', 'effort', 'fantastic', 'story', 'United', 'fan', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'how', 'event', 'shaped', 'resilience', 'strength', 'confidence', 'work', 'ethic', 'club', 'today']",United
