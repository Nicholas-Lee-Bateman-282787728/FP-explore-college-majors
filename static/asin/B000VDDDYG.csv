1100751,A1R0B7N4SSAD2M,B000VDDDYG,Geobub,"[0, 0]","The series has begun a transition from run-of-the-mill life issues to drama rich and emotionally heavy episodes against a backdrop of insane levels of smooching, feelings, and I Love you's. The movie Our Man Flint's operation smooch was more fun to watch with blonde bikini clad female operatives who take down evil master minds with a good smooch. Anyhow, the series about a Protestant Minister and his family's life is financed by a Jewish man and written by an ""Interfaith"" Catholic whose motto is ""do no harm.""  Many of the actors are Jewish or non-protestants who, in some cases, practice New Age theologies. The result is the show is a secular pipe dream of what protestant theology, conduct, and life is about. The manner of use of the guiding mantra of 'Do No Harm' in the show is not theologically sound in Protestant doctrine. Hampton, the author, uses the mantra to avoid difficult topics, discussing Christ, and promote left leaning ideologies in the show despite attempts to balance views on occasion in mild debates about temporally sensitive topics - now dated.A bothersome recurring theme in the series is the treatment of Muslims who are presented to possess character values much like traditional US citizens to the chagrin of the Islamic theological belief.  In Islamic theology, when in a weakened state of Jihad there is no compulsion in the faith.  The Muslim is to deceive the infidel and enumerate. This is a core theological belief in Islam despite any religious practice a Muslim may do or regardless of any backsliding or deception. The ultimate revelation in Islam is Surah 9:5 or the Sword of Allah which is counter to the Christian Axiom that those who live by the sword, die by the sword; Matthew 26:52. The Ultimate revelation in Christianity is Jesus Christ; John 3:16. This is countered in Islam by Surah 112 which is direct denial of John 3:16.  In truth, a Protestant has little in common with a Muslim from a character and theological perspective. They are polar opposites on nearly every point.The more accurate Protestant Christian depiction is that Christians become a new kind of character upon accepting Christ. Faith leads to salvation which leads to works of the Holy Spirit that includes, for the Christian, discerning between right and wrong; Matthew 7:5. In doing so, the Christian views all humans as created equal in the image of God. Therefore, Christians love the human and allow the Holy spirit to work through the Christian to change the character of other humans for the good, of course, of the Judeo-Christian God.Hampton's mantra to 'Do no harm' is perhaps more harmful than helpful as it turns a blind eye towards truth of the matters at hand in most cases.

1100762,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000VDDDYG,MollyRK,"[50, 53]","I always said that if the DVD manufacturers didn't get around to releasing all 11 seasons of 7th Heaven, I would be satisfied if they could just give us the first five. Well, not only is the series' (arguably) strongest and most credible season hitting stores in early December 2007 (just in time to stick it on your Christmas list if this is one of your favorites), but now that the show's run has finally been completed after 11 historical seasons, there's a good chance that the remaining 6 sets will find their way to DVD in time--and that is great news for the fans who have been loyally tuning in for all these years.Although I continued watching this show to the very end, when the final episode officially aired in May 2007, it's the first five years that probably had the biggest impact. While Seasons 1-3 focused mainly on the young, fresh, and vibrant Camden family that we came to know and love, Season 4 started suggesting that their lives might be headed in a direction that wasn't yet pronounced in the lives of these tight-knit, generally sunny and optimistic characters. Sure, the 7th Heaven-style drama was never in short supply, but it's this fifth round that really got it down just right, creating pain and heartbreak for Eric, Annie and their 7-children brood without making it too off-the-wall (which started to happen in the show's later years, when plot ideas were scarce and repetition was forced to keep the story alive). I vividly remember this season airing on television, and being a high school sophomore at the time, it was plain to see that they had truly hit their stride, creating real-life emotion and depicting the lives of people who were good and loving Christians, yet vulnerable characters who did not always have all the answers.The year opened in September 2001 with recent high school graduate Mary's decision to put college on hold for the time being, bumming around her parents' house and (occasionally) working for any employer who is patient enough to keep her around. ""Get used to it, because I'm not going to college until I figure out what I'm going to college for,"" the headstrong 18-year-old tells her mother and father--and when she gets really foolish by purchasing a lavish sports car and ignoring the monthly payment bills, things get just a little bit messier. Loving mother Annie thinks it is best to coddle her through this difficult time and hope that she will eventually come to her senses, but good old Dad knows that it is not quite that simple, and as husband and wife's arguments over the situation grow more frequent, it becomes apparent that Mary's current lease on life might not be in the best interest of the entire family. As for the remainder of the Camden offspring, college student Matt may be reaching an unsettling break in his relationship with Heather, and as his current roommate moves on in his own life, he is forced to move back home. Type-A goody-goody Lucy (you just can't deny it) starts off her senior year with a Homecoming Queen nomination and a relationship with a formerly suicidal young man, but by the year's end, she makes a very un-Lucy-like decision that leaves her parents concerned. High school freshman Simon struggles to fit into his new surroundings, and fifth grader Ruthie (brassy as ever, but also quite a smart little cookie) becomes the first in her family to gain admittance to an elite private school, and now that she's growing up, she's eager to start piling on the make-up. Oh, the joys of becoming a tweenager.Two-year-old twin boys Sam and David are also growing quickly and keeping the family on their toes, as toddlers tend to do, and Eric and Annie try their hardest to keep it all under control, but in the end, this entire season belongs to actress Jessica Biel, whose character undergoes a whole new metamorphosis after being arrested the previous year. Originally determined to work through these troubles and reinvent herself, Mary does what many a teenager in her exact position has done: she grows discouraged, gets stubborn, and risks losing herself to a world of laziness, deception, selfishness, and shockingly, even theft from her baby brothers' savings accounts. Oh yes, and this is also the year that we meet her new friends Frankie and Johnny, two teenage delinquents who work with Mary at the local pizza place, have a baby daughter that they can't seem to take care of, and threaten to pull once-innocent Mary into their own little land of alcohol and drugs. Eric and Annie must make one of the toughest mutual decisions of their lives when they finally take action with their troubled daughter, and although she does start to get her act together, bit by bit, the consequences of her past choices come back to haunt her as she must live with the reality of being perceived as the ""fallen angel"" of the Camden bunch.The emotional power of this season is one that I could write about forever, but in short, if you enjoy this show and want to see it at its absolute best, then I would strongly recommend that you pick up this DVD. The characters are still as solid and loving as ever, but as a dramatic twist hits the plot, you get a glimpse of a real American family with real problems and intense reality to deal with on a regular basis. In addition, among this season's special guest stars are ""Growing Pains"" alum Alan Thicke in a somewhat dark role, and ""Full House"" prodigies Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who were about 15 at the time and appeared in one episode as the rebellious love interests of Simon and one of his buddies. As teenage girls on the brink of adding more spice to their careers and showing the public that they weren't little kids anymore, the Olsens appeared to have a great time playing two girls who steal from local convenience stores, run out on a restaurant check, and convince innocent Simon Camden to sneak into a nearby movie theater. In retrospect, this wasn't Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen at their cutest or most likable, but regardless of that, it's fun to revisit them when they were a little younger.All in all, it's a season that should not be missed, and although the clean and faith-centered quality of 7th Heaven held up during all those 11 years, this right here is the Camdens in all their glory--with all the drama and success that they strived for, before Ms. Biel exited the show (at least as a regular cast member), and way before a slew of new characters clouded the plot. Also included in this collection is the show's landmark 100th episode, which chronicles Eric's birthday celebration and includes some special surprises for the birthday boy from two of his cherished daughters. It's a genuinely sweet episode and a pleasure to watch--certainly a highlight from Season 5, and perhaps one of the best in the entire series.As for the DVD's themselves......the packaging is sturdy, but it's clear as day that these DVD's have been thrown together faster than it takes to get through a one-hour episode. There are no special features, and some music has been changed, but that is becoming the norm. The thing that really needs to be addressed is the condensation of the episodes themselves, which have been done with Seasons 4 and 5. Nobody wants scenes edited out of the DVD's, especially when they are expected to shell out $40 for something that doesn't even have a couple interviews or featurettes tossed in. You're here to tell me they can't come up with a single bonus feature for an 11-season show, the longest-running drama in television history? Come on, folks, we're not dumb here. Unfortunately, if you enjoy the show and want them on DVD, this is what the public is receiving. Maybe they will at least make a few changes with Seasons 6-11, if we even see them all on DVD.Well, the good news is that after a few months, most stores mark the sets down to about $19.99, and sometimes even less, so if you don't want to pay the original $35 or $40 list price, you can wait a while and get it for less. I was shocked when I saw Season 3 on the shelf of my local Target for $17! Sounds about right, though, since it just includes 20-some edited episodes and nothing else.My opinion is that the show's downhill descent threw out its first couple of hints in Season 6, but just the same, it remained wholesome television that isn't very prevalent in today's world, and for that, let's hope that the DVD's for the last 6 seasons are not too far behind!",5,our beloved Camdens grow up
