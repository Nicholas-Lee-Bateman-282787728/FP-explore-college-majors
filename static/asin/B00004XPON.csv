At that time, all I wanted was more action, more of ""Billy"", and the martial arts...If I didn't like the character, ""Billy Jack"" so much...I'd have probably not given the film much thought.Over 30 years later I still like the character, and now have a more sentimental attachment to the films.I don't think I ever considered the ""historic accuracy""...I never took the movies as seriously as people seem to do today. To me, I was watching another Billy Jack movie. I liked the series of Billy Jack films in all their schlockiness and don't care much about ""historic accuracy"" orover analyzing....There are just some films out there you can't take seriously, I know Tom Laughlin did then and does, but I don't care.If you  saw the films as a youth as I did, and liked them, this film is for you, otherwise leave it alone.",3,For Billy Jack Fans-Not History Buffs,1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,1045,"['remember', 'seeing', 'film', 'eagerly', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'year', '.at', 'time', 'was', 'thirteen', 'found', 'movieentertaining', 'times', 'disappointing', 'just', 'too', 'heavy', 'politics', 'paranoia', 'time', 'wanted', 'was', 'more', 'action', 'more', 'Billy', 'martial', 'arts', 'did', ""n't"", 'character', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'so', 'much', ""'d"", 'have', 'probably', 'not', 'given', 'film', 'much', '30', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'character', 'now', 'have', 'more', 'sentimental', 'attachment', 'films.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'considered', 'historic', 'accuracy', 'never', 'took', 'movies', 'as', 'seriously', 'people', 'seem', 'do', 'today', 'was', 'watching', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'movie', 'liked', 'series', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'films', 'schlockiness', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'historic', 'accuracy', 'orover', 'analyzing', 'are', 'just', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'know', 'Tom', 'Laughlin', 'did', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'care.If', 'saw', 'films', 'youth', 'did', 'liked', 'film', 'otherwise', 'leave', 'alone']",The Trial of Billy Jack

The Trial of Billy Jack, with all of its lies, distortions, and over-the-top, cartoonishly evil characters, is just despicable. In one scene, a National Guard officer holds a pistol to another Guardsman's head and orders him to shoot and kill a peaceful, one-handed 13-year old boy (he lost his other hand when his father hacked it off in a fit of rage) who just wants to learn to play the guitar. It is way too long, and the acting (and singing) is really bad.

Laughlin and his wife seem like nice people, on the surface anyway, but, unfortunately, they have a really twisted view of the world.  This movie criticized both Jesus Christ and Saint Augustine.  That's scary.  It mentioned ""befriending"" demons in the part where Billy Jack prepares to descend into the cave to seek the vision.But the spiritual stuff (though it is false) is my favorite part of the movie.  The worst part of the original film, to me, was all the obnoxious young people vocalizing their uninformed opinions.  The Laughlin's daughter was not as obnoxious.  But most of them made Billy Jack look like George Bush in comparison.  And this type of stuff was most intense in this (very long) film.And you know there is something wrong when the so-called ""good"" guys get killed, and you are glad.

556727,A2DAAPYZTJ9PZA,B00004XPON,C. Moon,"[4, 9]","It is really remarkable this historic film has made it on to DVD, and equally remarkable how small our concept of what a movie has become.  It seems that ever since Star Wars, you just can't make a movie outside the box anymore without getting completely shunned by the community, but not Billy Jack.  This and the first Billy Jack are probably two of the most successful independent films ever, but while 'original' Billy Jack introduces most of Laughlin's favorite themes, he mostly sticks to the straight course.  With Trial, all precautions are thrown to the wind, and the final result is something you just need to take in its entirity.  Like other films from this period, their is a strong dose of symbolism and attempts to even give the film a cyclical nature (the film is actually framed where the first 15 minutes or so of the film actually occur chronologically right before the end.)  To make an analogy to music, the early 70's was the period of progressive rock, free jazz and concept albums--but also too in film.  Tom and Deloris continue to experiment with improvisation in this film, their are folk musical numbers, and the presentation does manage to flow more like a psychedelic piece than a normal film (see Boorman's Zardoz for example.)  It is hard to say if everything done here is completely intentional, and there are a few points that are certainly hillarious without meaning to be so.  Still, I find myself enjoying the many messages here, including the fact that Billy Jack actually fails and really isn't the hero of the film.  The philosophies toward education are actually inspiring, and I think Deloris's acting here really shines throughout the entire film--and in the end it is hard not to belive she is the character she is portraying.Well, in any event, this is a 3 hour THING and it isn't a perfect film and suffers at time from simple lack of budget, etc...but this also gives it a certain charm a lot of other films don't have.  Even if you don't care for the Billy Jack films, you have to give them credit for sticking with their dreams and fighting for it to the end.If you enjoy independent, unique films with a strong vision, this is one worth seeing, and unfortunatley will almost necessitate purchase since it is not to be found in video stores.",5,Best of the Billy Jack films,977270400,"12 20, 2000",2000,2290,"['really', 'remarkable', 'historic', 'film', 'made', 'DVD', 'equally', 'remarkable', 'how', 'small', 'concept', 'what', 'movie', 'become', 'ever', 'Star', 'Wars', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'box', 'anymore', 'getting', 'completely', 'shunned', 'community', 'not', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'first', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'are', 'probably', 'two', 'most', 'successful', 'independent', 'films', 'ever', ""'original"", 'Billy', 'Jack', 'most', 'Laughlin', 'favorite', 'themes', 'mostly', 'straight', 'course', 'Trial', 'precautions', 'are', 'thrown', 'wind', 'final', 'result', 'something', 'just', 'need', 'take', 'entirity', 'other', 'films', 'period', 'strong', 'dose', 'symbolism', 'attempts', 'even', 'give', 'film', 'cyclical', 'nature', 'film', 'actually', 'framed', 'where', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'actually', 'occur', 'chronologically', 'right', 'end', 'make', 'analogy', 'music', 'early', '70', 'was', 'period', 'progressive', 'rock', 'free', 'jazz', 'concept', 'albums', 'also', 'too', 'film', 'Tom', 'Deloris', 'continue', 'experiment', 'improvisation', 'film', 'are', 'folk', 'musical', 'numbers', 'presentation', 'manage', 'flow', 'more', 'psychedelic', 'piece', 'normal', 'film', 'see', 'Boorman', 'Zardoz', 'example', 'hard', 'say', 'everything', 'done', 'here', 'completely', 'intentional', 'are', 'few', 'points', 'are', 'certainly', 'hillarious', 'meaning', 'be', 'so', 'Still', 'find', 'enjoying', 'many', 'messages', 'here', 'including', 'fact', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'actually', 'really', ""n't"", 'hero', 'film', 'philosophies', 'education', 'are', 'actually', 'inspiring', 'think', 'Deloris', 'acting', 'here', 'really', 'entire', 'film', 'end', 'hard', 'not', 'belive', 'character', 'portraying.Well', 'event', '3', 'hour', 'THING', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'film', 'suffers', 'time', 'simple', 'lack', 'budget', 'etc', 'also', 'certain', 'charm', 'lot', 'other', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'films', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'sticking', 'dreams', 'fighting', 'end.If', 'enjoy', 'independent', 'unique', 'films', 'strong', 'vision', 'one', 'worth', 'seeing', 'unfortunatley', 'will', 'almost', 'necessitate', 'purchase', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'video', 'stores']",The Trial of Billy Jack

As others have said, comparing the real-life school shootings to the Freedom School ""massacre"" is reprehensible. Watch the movie without being high (a novel concept to the original target audience) and see that the groovy, peace-loving Freedom School kids (actually, a lot of them look college-age at least) start the violence at the school before the the shooting starts. If anyone would be to blame for what happened, it would be them. And the unit commander ordering the reluctant soldier to fire at the kids - by putting a pistol to his head? Please. And then the reluctant soldier shoots little one-armed Danny in the back....and he himself has a son about the same age or so named Danny? Ridiculous.This movie, incredibly enough, made some $31,000,000 - in 1975 dollars. That is some SERIOUS coin. Pot was definitely cheaper and more readily available, which explains two things - 1. Since it was so cheap, hippies, commies, and New Leftists had some money to spare to see this movie. 2. Someone would have HAD to been high to sit through this dreck.Oh yeah - all that money the Laughlins made off of this film? A lot of it was blown making the next Billy Jack movie - the hysterically bad ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington"". A film so bad it never really was released! Want to have some fun?

No coherent plot line, leftist drivel throughout, it's kinda like a serious, yet very disjointed ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh In"" type series of sketches.2. The acting in this is horrible. Tom Laughlin is passable, at best, as an actor. His wife, Delores Taylor, to be charitable, has neither passable acting skills nor a charismatic appearance. You'll note that she hasn't starred in a lot of movies sans the Billy Jack series.3. There's a young blond haired woman who can't really sing but who sings throughout this nonetheless, a balding doctor character who's passable from an acting standpoint, and some good scenic shots. In fact, the best thing about this entire movie is the scenery.

I'm a sucker for a long running time (this is the uncut version, running 174 minutes), so I decided to check it out.  It was actually one of the first films I ever rented from Netflix.  Having seen the whole thing, I can safely say that I've seen it once, and once was enough.  While there are some good scenes (some fight sequences are really good), the whole film is pedantic and preachy.  The sequence where Billy Jack goes into the mountain, hallucinates and sees green men is unintentionally hilarious.  The ending is also so ridiculously over melodramatic.  Everyone gathers to sing ""Give Peace a Chance"", which is a great song.  Unfortunately, here it ends up making you laugh more than anything else, which is a shame, as this scene comes right after a scene where national guardsmen shoot several students from Billy Jack's school.  So, instead of feeling sympathy with Billy Jack, his students, and the faculty of the school, you end up laughing.  That's not how you're supposed to feel.  The Trial of Billy Jack is an extraordinarily preachy film, with political correctness coming out of every frame (before the words political correctness became famous).  Even if you agree with some of the ideas (governments lie about war atrocities, the news media protects the government, etc., etc.), it hammers every point home so blatantly you end up just saying enough already.  It makes one understand why the ""silent majority"" voted for Nixon in 1972.  And with a megalong running time, the preachiness reaches epic proportions.

We then see Jean talking to reporters from the hospital bed. Billy Jack has been shot too.  They don't know if he will make it. Jean proceeds to tell about the horrible massacre that occurred on the reservation.On trial, Billy Jack could be arrested.  He just wanted to protect the Indians and thus he filed charges against the officers.  Jean's rape in 1971 is also discussed, but the lawyer does not believe she was actually raped.I was really disappointed in this third ""Billy Jack"" film.  The second film, BILLY JACK (1971), actually made you feel sorry for the Indians.  This third film is poorly-acted and over-acted.  It tries to be over-emotional.  It tries to stir up alot of issues.  They start with making statements about child abuse and later instead of making you feel something for the Indians, they actually are the trouble-makers in this film.  It is the Indians verses the police.The only scenes I found of interest were the Indian ceremony scenes when Billy Jack was hallucinating and being visited by spirits.John Navlin was the consultant for the filming of the Indian ceremonies.Note: Sacheen Littlefeather plays an attorney.  You may recall Miss Littlefeather on the 45th Academy Awards, March 27, 1973, when she walked onstage for Marlon Brando who just won the Best Actor Academy Award for The Godfather (1972).

This film opens with an extremely long sequence featuring the director of the school Billy was protecting in the last installment, recounting a long list of grievances to a reporter. In this sequence, virtually every hippie stereotype and left wing cause is aired. Intermingled with this retrospective diatribe are flashbacks of Billy Jack's legal trial and prison sentence.The ""trial"" referred to in the title does not seem to be the legal one mentioned above. After being released from prison, Billy undergoes a personal trial, replete with Indian mysticism. He is seeking to become a less violent person. This is the backdrop for the real point of the film.All events lead up to staging a massacre at the school similar in nature to the historic one at Kent State University. The movie is virtually a tribute to those who lost their lives. Little else is accomplished in terms of story or drama.The movie makes some valid and even good points about the politics of the day and indicts justs about everything associated with ""The Establishment"". It also back a few losing points of view. Whether these points of view are agreed with or not, however, the film could have been much stronger and made its point better.This is a very long film. That made it proportionally more difficult to sit through. It is propaganda of its time.

Willibey ""j2dogs""","[5, 8]","I get upset with all the negative comments I read regarding the violence/karate scenes 'Billy Jack'(there are only 2 karate scenes in each, 'Billy Jack' & 'Trial of B.J.') probably less than 5-6 minutes of the total movie, yet people seem to ONLY remember those scenes and not all the PEACE & LOVE demonstrated throughout the movies. Ignorant people and ignorant federal, state and local government caused any other violence portrayed in these films!Tom Laughlin's caring, self sacrifice and contributions to the enlightenment of this country's people through his 'Billy Jack' series of movies is just staggering in my humble opinion. As relevant today in 2006, as it was back in the seventies.I personally felt as if a bolt of lightening had just hit me in the head (and heart) as I walked out of that theatre after my first 'Billy Jack' experience so long ago. This young sophmore kid in high school determined to go out into the world and be an example myself, to try to make a personal and positive difference henceforth, no matter how large or small.And, all those ticket sales verifying the 'Billy Jack' movie(s) popularity....just can't be wrong! 'Billy Jack' is the biggest selling independent film and on the list of the biggest selling top 20 films ever! Back in the 70's these movies literally enlightened and changed my life! And after watching them all over again in 2006 (including the 'Billy Jack Goes to Washington' which never got released) I have to say I think they are changing things yet again in my life, in ways I never imagined.While I'm no expert on the workings and goings on of Hollywood, CA nor Washington D.C., I have no doubt that Tom Laughlin (and his wife Delores Taylor) 'hit the nail on the head' when they created these films.

It is only a format for Tom Laughlin to spot many of his esoteric views.The next chapter of the film is notoriously long as the character Jean (Taylor) continnues to recounts events from a hospital bed about the kids at the &quot;school&quot; and the local evil rich people.  This movie is just too preachy and it never bothers to examine some of their (school) prejudges and uncivil behavior.The only redeeming value is that Tom Laughlin still brings out a &quot;Billy Jack&quot; persona.

In the first movie, Billy Jack stands up for the downtrodden free-spirited kids in a quiet western town - and gets into a fight that results in a few deaths. He wants to just make a stand and die, but Miss Jean Roberts, his girlfriend convinces him to turn himself in. That's where the story ends.These movies were made during the times of rioting and political unrest, and it's important to keep that context in mind. Kent State is explicitly mentioned several times in the opening scenes, with Jean lamenting, ""students are slaughtered by trigger-happy police types and nothing is ever done about it.""The movie is in essence a long flashback sequence. It starts where movie #1 ended, with Billy Jack being tried. Roberts is accused of lying about her rape. Billy explains how the US government killed innocent women and children in Vietnam - soldiers were told to ""waste them"". Billy refused to participate in that dastardly killing. My Lai is of course brought up here. At the end of the trial, Billy was tossed into jail, while the students work on growing the school.We head into the school's world of biofeedback, meditation, yoga football, belly dancing and singing. The self-governing students work on child abuse and orphanages, and move on to exposing government corruption and consumer issues. They laugh about how corrupted Nixon was. Soon they have a TV station and broadcast news about abuses in the area. In retaliation, the students' phones are bugged and the FBI begins investigating the school.Jean talks about loving child abusers instead of punishing them - that if child abuse organizations ""love"" bad parents, they will all start being nice to their kids.Skip to scenes of blatant police brutality and also police feeling up women during searches. Typical quote - ""Police - they're so damned corrupt."" Oddly, for a movie which claims to champion the rights of women, there is a *lot* of gratuitous breast jiggling shots in this film.I won't give away the ending, but I think you see the pattern here. This movie is *very* black and white. The kids are always good, noble, kind, and super-wise, super-intelligent (and sexy). The police, government and businessmen are always evil, corrupted and power-hungry (and ugly). Many of the statistics they quote to back their statements up are completely wrong. It's one thing to make a point, but it's quite another to lie in order to make your points. My boyfriend and I laughed out loud several times because the movie tipped so heavily into its over-the-top dialogue.That being said, I can certainly understand how parts of this movie might appeal to viewers who had never heard of some of these concepts before. It's like people watching the Matrix and being wowed at the philosophies explained there, because they'd never learned them in high school. The Trial of Billy Jack covers many important basic ideas. The idea that people of honor should stand up for what's right even if it's difficult. The idea that you should focus, every day, on what is really important - not on blown-up but fleeting emergencies. The idea that even if people are violent or angry with you, that you should have the self-possession and maturity to stay calm and peaceful yourself in response. The idea that you should seek to find balance in your life.These are certainly all very important philosophies, but there are many other movies which make these points without having to resort to exaggeration, untruths and stereotypes. I really like the message - but I don't like being led by the nose with wild inaccuracies to try to drive the message home. In many ways it makes the message far less palatable. In one scene you watch an entire roomful of ""regular people"" stand around while they torture a fellow human being.

(The old bad guys are gone, but new ones have replaced them.)  The new local rednecks come and make trouble for the hippies, even burning down the television station.  Billy Jack uses his martial arts skills to fight them, but the rednecks make more trouble, then Billy Jack fights them off, then the rednecks try again, and Billy Jack...You get the idea.  The whole thing repeats itself over and over with no real point.  Finally we get to the over-the-top ending, where the National Guard are called in, and they start shooting up the Freedom School, until the local Indians arrive, and their chief gives a solemn speech, after which the National Guardsmen stop shooting everyone and walk off.  Amazingly, only a few members of the Freedom School are harmed.""Billy Jack"" had a meager charm, but this movie is just plain overdone and stupid.

556743,A3EYI0IZOEXZ96,B00004XPON,Michael R. Fallon,"[0, 0]","Oh what this movie could have been. The movie is nearly three hours, which is way too long, because an hour and a half of it is narration of liberal activism, philosophy, and Native American religion and mysticism. All very preachy. If you were to take all that out, it would have had half a chance as being a decent entertaining film. The conflict between the locals, the school and character Carl Posner could have been done much better. This movie was made during the time of Watergate, the sexual revolution, and at the end of the Vietnam War. If Laughlin had just stayed with the basic morality play, the peace and love philosophy (with a little karate butt kicking) theme would have played better. I especially thought the ending was a little over the top. It is too bad. If Laughlin had focused on the hero Billy Jack as a one man army kicking butt and setting things right, he may of had a string of Billy Jack movies, but let his ego and his activisim got in the way of his judgement. &#34;The Born Losers&#34; and &#34;Billy Jack&#34; were okay at least.

556745,A1OCVWN4K4Q3FN,B00004XPON,M. Keogh,"[2, 4]","""The Trial of Billy Jack"" was one of the bigger box-office hits of the 1970's.  Yet today it is almost utterly forgotten except by nostalgic, aging hippies and bad movie buffs.The third of the four Billy Jack movies, and the second film in the series which expounded the far left political beliefs of its star/writer/director/producer Tom Laughlin, ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" is a nearly three hour exercise of sanctimonious self-aggrandizement and leftist political diatribes presented in the most juvenile manner possible.  It was also massive ego-trip on the behalf of Laughlin.It may be understandable that Laughlin's ego was running on overdrive when he made this piece of dreck.  Afterall he had just scored a massive hit with 1971's ""Billy Jack.""  Written, directed, and starring Laughlin in the title role, ""Billy Jack"" was an updated version of ""Shane"" brilliantly marketed to flower children.  Basically, it was a violent action movie with a protagonist that punched, kicked, and shot his way through waves of rednecks in order to make the world safe for flower power.  ""Billy Jack"" is now laughably dated, but how it was marketed set the standard for today's blockbusters and it influenced Stallone's ""First Blood"" and several Steven Seagal movies.  However, Laughlin failed to see that the success of ""Billy Jack"" had mainly derived from its being a shrewd action flick with a counter-culture bent, and instead misinterpretated that it was the film's leftist politics that had been the driving force behind its success.The result of that misreading was ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" which contains hours of rambling discourse on Indian rights and political corruption and tons of faux American Indian spirituality, but not enough of the kung fu for peace violence that had made ""Billy Jack"" such a hit with drug-addled, hypocritical hippies.  In other words- it's BORING!  Oh, it does contain scenes of Billy Jack punching faces, breaking bones, and crushing throats in the name of peace and love, but those scenes are few in comparison to the non-stop sanctimonious preaching on the part of Laughlin and his homely, untalented wife and co-star, Delores Taylor, who plays ""Jean"" the director of the absurd Freedom School and Billy's main squeeze.The actual trial in ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" is just a small part of the film.  Billy is convicted and receives a light jail sentence for killing at least two people during the events of ""Billy Jack.""  (It's hard to take seriously the film's constant attacks on the oppressive ""system"" when that system sends a murderer to jail for just a few brief years.)  Meanwhile Jean's Freedom School becomes a force of political agitation through ""scorching exposes"" of politicians and capitalists by founding a television station and inventing a machine that can tell when a person on TV or radio is lying.  Of course, ""the Man,"" who is the victim of these ""scorching exposes,"" is determined to shut down Jean and her Freedom School by any means possible.Billy is released from prison and reunited with the love of his life, his hat.  Tensions rise between the Freedom School hippies and the powers-that-be and their redneck goons with Billy saving hippie butt from redneck beatdowns.  Tears flow constantly from Jean.  And it goes on and on.  By the end, when the National Guard storms the school and starts blasting hippies, you'll be cheering: ""Get them!""""The Trial of Billy Jack"" was Laughlin's last hurrah.  To his credit, he had made this movie with his own money so his vision would be uncomprimised.  When critics justifiably savaged the movie, Laughlin retorted through full page ads in major newspapers.  The end result was that Laughlin lost most of his fortune.  He also lost his audience.  The kids may have shown up for opening weekend in droves with visions of the violent ""Billy Jack"" in their memories, but they never came back after the borefest that is this film.  The last ""Billy Jack"" movie, ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington"" was barely released and Laughlin quietly disappeared from the film scene.",1,Sanctimonious ego-trip!,1127606400,"09 25, 2005",2005,4063,"['Trial', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'was', 'one', 'bigger', 'box-office', 'hits', '1970', 'today', 'almost', 'utterly', 'forgotten', 'nostalgic', 'aging', 'hippies', 'bad', 'movie', 'buffs.The', 'third', 'four', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'movies', 'second', 'film', 'series', 'expounded', 'far', 'left', 'political', 'beliefs', 'star/writer/director/producer', 'Tom', 'Laughlin', 'Trial', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'nearly', 'three', 'hour', 'exercise', 'sanctimonious', 'self-aggrandizement', 'leftist', 'political', 'diatribes', 'presented', 'most', 'juvenile', 'manner', 'possible', 'was', 'also', 'massive', 'ego-trip', 'behalf', 'Laughlin.It', 'may', 'be', 'understandable', 'Laughlin', 'ego', 'was', 'running', 'overdrive', 'when', 'made', 'piece', 'dreck', 'Afterall', 'had', 'just', 'scored', 'massive', 'hit', '1971', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'Written', 'directed', 'starring', 'Laughlin', 'title', 'role', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'was', 'updated', 'version', 'Shane', 'brilliantly', 'marketed', 'flower', 'children', 'Basically', 'was', 'violent', 'action', 'movie', 'protagonist', 'punched', 'kicked', 'shot', 'way', 'waves', 'rednecks', 'order', 'make', 'world', 'safe', 'flower', 'power', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'now', 'laughably', 'dated', 'how', 'was', 'marketed', 'standard', 'today', 'blockbusters', 'influenced', 'Stallone', 'First', 'Blood', 'several', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'movies', 'However', 'Laughlin', 'failed', 'see', 'success', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'had', 'mainly', 'derived', 'being', 'shrewd', 'action', 'flick', 'counter-culture', 'bent', 'instead', 'misinterpretated', 'was', 'film', 'leftist', 'politics', 'had', 'been', 'driving', 'force', 'success.The', 'result', 'misreading', 'was', 'Trial', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'hours', 'rambling', 'discourse', 'Indian', 'rights', 'political', 'corruption', 'tons', 'faux', 'American', 'Indian', 'spirituality', 'not', 'enough', 'kung', 'fu', 'peace', 'violence', 'had', 'made', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'such', 'hit', 'drug-addled', 'hypocritical', 'hippies', 'other', 'words-', 'BORING', 'Oh', 'contain', 'scenes', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'punching', 'breaking', 'bones', 'crushing', 'throats', 'name', 'peace', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'comparison', 'non-stop', 'sanctimonious', 'preaching', 'part', 'Laughlin', 'homely', 'untalented', 'wife', 'co-star', 'Delores', 'Taylor', 'who', 'Jean', 'director', 'absurd', 'Freedom', 'School', 'Billy', 'main', 'squeeze.The', 'actual', 'trial', 'Trial', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'just', 'small', 'part', 'film', 'Billy', 'convicted', 'light', 'jail', 'sentence', 'killing', 'least', 'two', 'people', 'events', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'film', 'constant', 'attacks', 'oppressive', 'system', 'when', 'system', 'murderer', 'jail', 'just', 'few', 'brief', 'years', 'Meanwhile', 'Jean', 'Freedom', 'School', 'force', 'political', 'agitation', 'scorching', 'exposes', 'politicians', 'capitalists', 'founding', 'television', 'station', 'inventing', 'machine', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'person', 'TV', 'radio', 'lying', 'course', 'Man', 'who', 'victim', 'scorching', 'exposes', 'determined', 'shut', 'down', 'Jean', 'Freedom', 'School', 'means', 'possible.Billy', 'released', 'prison', 'reunited', 'love', 'life', 'hat', 'Tensions', 'rise', 'Freedom', 'School', 'hippies', 'powers-that-be', 'redneck', 'goons', 'Billy', 'saving', 'hippie', 'butt', 'redneck', 'beatdowns', 'Tears', 'flow', 'constantly', 'Jean', 'end', 'when', 'National', 'Guard', 'school', 'blasting', 'hippies', ""'ll"", 'be', 'cheering', 'Get', 'Trial', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'was', 'Laughlin', 'last', 'hurrah', 'credit', 'had', 'made', 'movie', 'own', 'money', 'vision', 'would', 'be', 'uncomprimised', 'When', 'critics', 'justifiably', 'savaged', 'movie', 'Laughlin', 'retorted', 'full', 'page', 'ads', 'major', 'newspapers', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'Laughlin', 'lost', 'most', 'fortune', 'also', 'lost', 'audience', 'kids', 'may', 'have', 'shown', 'up', 'opening', 'weekend', 'droves', 'visions', 'violent', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'memories', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'borefest', 'film', 'last', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'movie', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'was', 'barely', 'released', 'Laughlin', 'quietly', 'disappeared', 'film', 'scene']",The Trial of Billy Jack

Laughlin is brilliant as Billy once more here and his real life wife, Delores, excellent as Jean again. As for some of the rest of the cast well their daughter Theresa is back as student Carol, now more of a young lady than little girl as in the previous film, and she's appealing in her many scenes. The actors playing bad guys this time around are talented-enough actors but their characters are not particularly distinct as the bad guys in films one and two were. The action scenes are done well enough but there's no equal to that park brawl, in film 2, anywhere in this picture. But on the big plus side we learn lots more about BillyJack and his past in Vietnam. Missing now but whom were in film 2 are cutiepie Julie Webb as Barbara, whom Jean obtained legal custody of at the end of film 2. I think we are supposed to believe Barbara is somewhere in that melange of students we now see but her presence is something we sourly miss. Also, Clark Howat as the Sheriff, the one here in this film is not anywhere near as interesting a fellow. Plus, Bert Freed as rich bigot Stewart Posner.
