967484,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000E3L7F0,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[8, 45]","I used to think that actors that could not succeed in cinema would inevitably find their way, by choice or otherwise, into the television circuit.  As a viewer of mainstream awards shows, I would sometimes snicker at the sight of a once strong film actor attempting to gain recognition for his work in a short-lived television series.  It felt like a dog settling for a plastic bone when the real, juicy bone was within walking distance.  I used to feel as if it was an opportunity for actors to work without really trying.  Well, it is with my greatest delight that I announce to the world that I disown that thought.  With the birth of such programming like Sopranos, Six Feet Under, and Lost television has become an incubator for both newly discovered actors to gain popularity, while bigger, sometimes seasoned actors to redefine their acting ""chops"".  As cinemas scratch their heads surrounding recent attendance records, television seems to be upping their profile to bring interesting, provocative, and creative programming to the masses.  We, as viewers, are staying at home instead of spending at the theaters because we can see stronger performances, developed stories, and power characters while sitting on the comfort of our own couch ... so why bother going out?Recently, my wife and I had the opportunity to enjoy the first season of Huff without paying for the high price of cable.  I had heard the critic's citations surrounding the program and their boasts of amazing acting by both Hank Azaria and Blythe Danner.  I had to see the hype.  A psychiatrist evaluating his own life while attempting to save those that he treats.  It seemed like a refreshing concept.  Alas, much to my dismay, and to the disagreement of my wife, I didn't see sed hype.  What I instead witnessed were complex characters surrounded by choppy stories that seemed to jump from one tangent island to the next without any map in sight, misguided characters that used unbelievable ""real-life"" situations to gain support, ""After School Special"" acting that proved $15 can buy you fame, and just a sprinkle of jaw-dropping characters that created just enough addiction to keep you watching to the last show.  Obviously ""borrowing"" from its competitor's ideas and strengths, Huff felt like a collage of every other drama-based television program on the market.  Instead of being original, it ""borrowed"" ideas from other shows and attempted to sell us on its own originality.  Showtime, the television station, ""borrowed"" the psychologist idea from Sopranos and the insane brother from Six Feet Under, and mixed it all together to get this mediocre (at best) show.As I fell pray to the ounce of addiction that Huff allowed, I found myself bored with most episodes, anxiously waiting for scenes that involved two side characters, and a bit insane myself with the amount of filler that was used to overcompensate for the lack of story in each 45+ minute long episode.  Again, kudos for small level of addiction that forced me to watch this series to the un-dramatic cliff-hanger of an ending, but overall this first season for Huff isn't as great as the critics seem to think.  Azaria's ""Huff"" is shallow, slow, and obviously blind to the fact that the real insanity lurks around his family, not just in the comfort of his pricey office.  His wife, Beth, who feels like she rehearsed for the scene in just an hour while applying her own make-up, accompanies him adding enough to question her own sanity through the show.  Their child, Byrd, could possibly be the only ""strong"" adult in the house, but we are unable to appreciate him because we are too consumed with Huff's conflicts.  The writers throw in meaningless banter between him and his short-time girlfriend Gail only to add to the drama.  Huff's mother, Izzy, played by Blythe Danner is powerful enough that she overshadows everyone else in this series ... except for one.  If I could say one thing positive about this program is Oliver Platt.  He, and only he, brings this series to life.  It is his character that continued to draw me into watching each episode back to back to back.  He has a spark that nobody else in the series could match and only proves my point that television is giving a larger medium for decent actors to show us their true talents.  For anyone wanting to watch this first season, Oliver Platt is electrifying.Overall, I just felt a bit used with this series.  I felt as if the drama was put in place to fill the time, not because of character faults or circumstances.  Azaria is decent, but Danner and Platt cannot be matched.  Without these two, this would be a quickly failed series.  As I watched each episode, it became clear that resolutions were not being made, issues were not being resolved (but instead forgotten until later episodes), clich?s were being drawn, and what started as possible originality, actually felt nothing more than reused newspaper.  While my wife seemed captivated by the surroundings, I felt tired with the yelling, the screaming, the constant breaking of dishes, and the repetitive structure of the show.  Huff had opportunities to break free and become a stronger, independent program, but instead it played it safe.  It never quite explored ""darkened"" territory, but felt comfortable staying well within the lines.  I was disappointed with Huff because it did not take stronger chances, but more importantly, because it painted a obscured picture of reality.  This never felt honest, but instead glossy and primitive.Watch it once, shame on you.Watch it twice, shame on me.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Huff and Puff (will it blow my house down?),1147046400,"05 8,

967493,A3IM77LLZAN8B6,B000E3L7F0,J. W. Hickey,"[5, 5]","This show prides itself on presenting characters who not only speak their minds but also articulate their feelings with courageous (or sometimes catty) candor.  This makes the program compelling and endearing, if not quite true-to-life.  It's rather like the best of Bergman's b&w; '60s dramas, which for me resembled O'Neill's STRANGE INTERLUDE:  people voicing non-communication in a language not familiar to me, while their actual thoughts were spelled out at the bottom of the screen.  Surely few Americans could expose their thoughts in such spoken frankness, I imagined back then.An advantage of this narrative method is that we become engaged in the characters at several complex levels; hence the compelling nature of the series as a whole.  It's also nice to see that a creative force behind THIRTY SOMETHING before this HUFF project has grown up enough to treat elders as something more complicated than the shrill dufuss parents who got blamed so often for the main characters' problems.  The commentary says they wanted Huff's in-laws to illustrate a good marriage, but they couldn't resist replaying the ""parents' affairs in the past"" card that had cropped up with Mel's ""good marriage parents"" in the anniversary episode.  In any case, it's nice to see Blythe's bridge friends aren't dismissed as a coven of geese.The series prides itself in dodging cliches--mid-life crisis affairs being one that threatened to flirt with predictability but pulled out in time.  The brainy son is involved in another minor plot knot of this nature, about peer pressure; it, too, is resolved in a surprising and pleasing way, though one might expect some sort of mean-spirited retribution from the other kids.  Frankly glad not to see them again, but they were a dark force that could make for an unpleasant plot development.The yin and yang of the series are Huff the Compassionate (to a fault) and his best friend, the master of self-destruction and amoral pragmatism (is it redundant to say he's an attorney?).  The in-our-face intimacy with this jerk (including toilet paper use) is sometimes hard to take, raising in me at least the same queasiness I felt with the gamblers' impulsiveness in Altman's CALIFORNIA SPLIT.

The first day we meet psychiatrist Craig Hufstodt, known as Huff to his friends, a teenage patient shoots himself in Huff's office.  Stricken and guilt-ridden Huff turns to his family's support to get him through this troubled time.  Huff's family is composed of his wife Beth, a party planner who seems more concerned with her career than her family, his mother Izzy (played by the always excellent Blythe Danner) who lives with him and his wife and whose antagonistic relationship with Beth is reason enough to watch the show, and his son Byrd, who Huff accurately describes as ""14 going on 40.""  Rounding out his support system are his best friend and lawyer Russell (played by Oliver Platt in an increasingly over the top and hysterical fashion) who is a misogynist with a drug, booze and debauchery problem, and his brother Teddy, a schizophrenic mental patient who Huff often visits.This show is full of twists and turns and you never quite know what's going to happen next.  It leaves you wondering what the significance is of the homeless Hungarian man who seems to appear as if from nowhere and wondering if Huff will ever get his life sorted out.  Platt and Danner shine in their supporting roles and I've never seen finer work from Hank Azaria than in his role as Huff. Others to look out for: Lara Flynn Boyle as a manic depressive patient who goes over the edge and Swoosie Kurtz as Beth's mother.

Hank Azaria, Oliver Platt, Blythe Danner, Swoozie Kurtz and Faith Prince?  Among others!  It starts off good and then gets its footing and ends up great.  The last episode is as good a show as any television can ask for.  One problem is that hampers the show is the two major characters, the husband and wife, who are dour and always arguing with each other.  The hostility is great enough to question the bond with each other.  As the creators of the show point out in their commentary, the tension is that Huff puts his work and clients above his wife and child in a way that promotes the wife's hostility.  The grandmothers are often left to raise the son and promote his development into adulthood.  It definitely can happen in real life but doesn't endear the husband and wife to the audience.  The major contributions on the show are left to terrific actors who play the character roles .  They are wonderful and have great parts to play.

Of course, I LOVED Blythe Danner as Huff's mother--she's the main reason I wanted to see the show--and she definitely deserved her two Emmy Awards for her wonderful performance as a woman who hides her pain with a sharp tongue.  It's worth watching ""Huff"" just for Ms. Danner.  Then a few months ago I decided to sit down and watch the second episode, which I enjoyed a lot more than the first.  Then I watched a third and a fourth episode--and I fell in love with the series and all of the memorable characters: Hank Azaria as Huff has never been better, Paget Brewster as Huff's wife Beth is letter perfect, Anton Yelchin is terrific as Huff's teenage son (his relationship with the girl he tutors is a riot), Andy Comeau is quietly effective in his brief appearances in each episode as Huff's troubled brother, and Oliver Platt is outrageous and quite touching as Huff's best friend, Russel.  Even the smaller roles are expertly cast with excellent actors, including Kimberly Brooks as Huff's no-nonsense office manager, Liza Lapira as Russel's no-nonsense secretary and Faith Prince as Kelly Knippers, whom Russel becomes involved with--all three of these women are outstanding! The only character I didn't care for was the Homeless Hungarian--I just didn't think he was necessary--and, fortunately, he's not around much in the later episodes.  With the first season ending on a doozy of a cliffhanger, I eagerly await the second season to arrive on DVD.  I have a frustrated feeling that I'll be waiting a long time for this, since I don't think Sony is in any rush to release ""Huff's"" second season on DVD.  ""Huff"" is a show that will grow on you--it sneaks up on you and forces you to love it.  Oh, and I almost forgot about one of my favorite actresses--Swoosie Kurtz, who plays Beth's ill mother--another great performance.  ""Huff"" is overflowing with greatness in all departments.

I saw that Anton Yelchin was in this series and bought it, and without commercials, I enjoyed it all. Anton, as I have said a million times, is an actor to watch. I heard he is co-starring in a new picture. It was in the Los Angeles paper. Good for him. He started young like Brad Renfro, even younger than Brad. He co-starred in FRIGHT NIGHT with Colin Farrell. He has been with major stars in most of his films. I enjoyed HUFF, but I won't buy anymore TV series. Unlike movies, once you watch a series, you never have to watch it again.
