872472,AGCVPCMDY4Q2W,B0006SGQ4A,David Harvey,"[4, 4]","I mis-read the title of the DVD as being the first season of M.A.S.K., not Volume 1.  However, the 5 episodes on the DVD are in excellent condition.  The first episode, The Deathstone, has been transferred with the film backwards (the people are driving in the passenger side seat, their hair is parted on the wrong side, etc.) but the quality of the animation (video) and sound are still great.  The other four episodes were transferred correctly and the video/sound are great on those as well.  My brother and his family were recently over for a visit, and his kids watched this DVD while here.  They are 14 and 11 years old, and they both told me that it was the coolest cartoon they had ever seen, and the look on their faces when I told them how old the cartoons were was priceless!!  Even then, they still when on the rest of the day about the different cars, masks, etc.  I'd highly recommend this DVD to anyone who was a fan of the show, or just loves cool cars!",5,I mis-read the title,1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,970,"['mis-read', 'title', 'DVD', 'being', 'first', 'season', 'M.A.S.K.', 'not', 'Volume', '1', 'However', '5', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', 'excellent', 'condition', 'first', 'episode', 'Deathstone', 'been', 'transferred', 'film', 'backwards', 'people', 'are', 'driving', 'passenger', 'side', 'seat', 'hair', 'parted', 'wrong', 'side', 'etc', 'quality', 'animation', 'video', 'sound', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'other', 'four', 'episodes', 'were', 'transferred', 'correctly', 'video/sound', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'brother', 'family', 'were', 'recently', 'visit', 'kids', 'watched', 'DVD', 'here', 'are', '14', '11', 'years', 'old', 'told', 'was', 'coolest', 'cartoon', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'look', 'when', 'told', 'how', 'old', 'cartoons', 'were', 'was', 'priceless', 'Even', 'then', 'still', 'when', 'rest', 'day', 'different', 'cars', 'masks', 'etc', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'fan', 'show', 'just', 'loves', 'cool', 'cars']",N/A

The transfer is not the best, but these are 80's cartoons, so they don't have much to work with.  The audio hisses like crazy.  I have no idea why I was so big into this cartoon, it's actually kinda bad, but it's nostalgic.  It's fun to remember all the toys that I bought like a dumb American consumer.  :)  If you want M.A.S.K. on DVD, this is your only shot, so it's ""awesome"" I guess.  If you simply like 80's cartoons, there are better out there.",3,"Good...

872476,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B0006SGQ4A,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[28, 29]","Led by Matt Traker, Mobile Armored Strike Komand (MASK) agents were regularly dispatched from their Boulder Hill headquarters to fight the equally high-tech VENOM agents. We never get a location for the series, but I have reason to believe that it is somewhere in the mountain states or California.The animation holds up fairly well 20 years later, but the catchiest part of this cartoon was the lyrics to the theme song. 'Secret agents working overtime, fighting crime....' Each MASK agent had a mask (duh) which emitted a special power and a vehicle which transformed from 'normal' to 'battle' mode instantly.In addition to comanding a team of multicultural agents, Matt has his hands full trying to be a father to Scott (who can periodically get in the way, along with his robot pal T-Bob). I think that Scott was supposed to draw in many more young viewers to this series, but I never felt they were great characters. I personally would have rather been out fighting against VENOM than clowning around with the two of them.MASK was a good cross between Transformers (unarguably THE most popular 80's robot toy) and the ongoing James Bond series.",4,Another good 80's cartoon made it to DVD,1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,1149,"['Led', 'Matt', 'Traker', 'Mobile', 'Armored', 'Strike', 'Komand', 'MASK', 'agents', 'were', 'regularly', 'dispatched', 'Boulder', 'Hill', 'fight', 'equally', 'high-tech', 'VENOM', 'agents', 'never', 'get', 'location', 'series', 'have', 'reason', 'believe', 'somewhere', 'mountain', 'states', 'California.The', 'animation', 'up', 'fairly', 'well', '20', 'years', 'later', 'catchiest', 'part', 'cartoon', 'was', 'lyrics', 'theme', 'song', ""'Secret"", 'agents', 'working', 'overtime', 'fighting', 'crime', 'MASK', 'agent', 'had', 'mask', 'duh', 'emitted', 'special', 'power', 'vehicle', 'transformed', ""'normal"", ""'battle"", 'mode', 'instantly.In', 'addition', 'comanding', 'team', 'multicultural', 'agents', 'Matt', 'hands', 'full', 'trying', 'be', 'father', 'Scott', 'who', 'can', 'periodically', 'get', 'way', 'robot', 'pal', 'T-Bob', 'think', 'Scott', 'was', 'supposed', 'draw', 'many', 'more', 'young', 'viewers', 'series', 'never', 'felt', 'were', 'great', 'characters', 'personally', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'been', 'out', 'fighting', 'VENOM', 'clowning', 'two', 'them.MASK', 'was', 'good', 'cross', 'Transformers', 'unarguably', 'most', 'popular', '80', 'robot', 'toy', 'ongoing', 'James', 'Bond', 'series']",N/A
