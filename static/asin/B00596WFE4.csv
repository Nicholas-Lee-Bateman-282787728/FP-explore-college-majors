1447861,A3LYXG5HR8ANOQ,B00596WFE4,ijidude,"[1, 3]","Hollywood actor Michael Rodrick says he used his childhood experience speaking in tongues at a charismatic church to help prepare him for scenes as the serial killer, John Lee, in ""The River Murders,"" a movie that was released in 2011. Ray Liota stars in the movie as Jack Verdon, a homicide detective who investigates a series of murders. Other actors include Ving Rhames, Gisele Fraga, Melora Walters and Christian Slater, who plays a caustic FBI investigator. The movie was produced by Rich Cowan, Richard Salvatore, Daniel Toll and Steve Anderson. Anderson wrote the script for the movie and Cowan directed. Anderson's short film, ""Hearts of Stone,"" was the 1987 runner-up for an Academy Award and played at the Sundance Film Festival. He followed that by working with Oliver Stone on ""South Central,"" a gritty film about gangs in South Central Los Angeles. The film follows a few black men as they become involved in neighborhood gangs, crime, drugs, prison and shattered family life.In ""The River Murders,"" detective Liota becomes the prime suspect when the FBI discovers that he has close personal ties to all the female murder victims. The plot follows Rodrick in his role as serial killer preying on women, all of whom have known Liota. In a youtube featurette, Cowan says Rodrick was one of 40 men who were called back to read with Liota. Cowan and Anderson are interviewed about the decision to cast Rodrick in the role. Cowan says they went through about 600 actors before deciding on Rodrick. ""From the moment he came in and read with Ray, we were convinced (Rodrick) was the guy,"" Cowan said.Liota does a credible job in his role as a detective, but there are aspects of the movie treatment that are simply not believable. During the investigation, Liota's character reveals that he has had at least 100 sex partners, including another female detective that he is working with. He was married at the time of the affair with the detective, who is fairly attractive. The investigation creates turmoil at home with his wife, which is understandable. And it's certainly not unusual to see movies about serial killers. It seems to be a favorite both on TV and the big screen. What is not believable about the movie is that Liota's character has had 100 lovers, or had sex with at least 100 women. It's not that it's not impossible for any one person. It's that in real life, for a detective with the looks of Liota, it does not seem possible. Do women fall all over unknown men who are detectives who hang out at bars - those who look like Liota - a detective who seems sincere and genuinely concerned about his partner and others? No. It's not that A-list actors can't have sex with movie star groupies who fall all over them. It's that Liota is not playing an A-list actor. He is playing an ordinary police detective.Rodrick says he studied documentaries on psychopaths and serial killers to help him with the role. ""You start to see a pattern, that they are master manipulators,"" he said. Rodick plays the seemingly sincere, but manipulative and deadly killer well. ""He (God) has a plan for you,"" Rodrick says in one scene before he kills one of the women. Rodrick reveals he (or his family) visited a few churches growing up in  New Jersey where the charismatic churches ""spoke in tongues."" ""I was very affected by that as a teenager,"" Rodrick says. He asked the director if he could use some of his ""speaking in tongues"" experiences or characterizations on the set to psych himself into his serial killer role. Rodrick is seen psyching himself for the scene with ""speaking in tongue"" jibberish.  He sits on top of his naked female victim with her hands tied to the bedpost. ""My brothers and my sisters all have died the sins of the father,"" he says in a menacing voice. She answers in moans, her mouth stuffed with a rag. Near the end of filming Cowan asks Rodrick to record his voice for a short end of movie narration: ""Remember me. My soul will live forever in your sinner's heart. I am the way. I am the truth. I am the light. I am the resurrection.""For Christians, the scene may be disturbing since Rodick is paraphrasing John 14:6, a New Testament passage in the Bible: Thomas said to him, ""Lord, we don't know where you are going so how can we know the way?"" Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."" This is a strange element in the movie: a serial killer who quotes parts of the Bible as part of his demented character. Did Anderson do research on serial killers and find that good number of them were demented Christians who quoted scripture? Or is this an attack on the Bible and Christianity by the writer? It may be a result of the Hollywood climate toward labeling Christians as extremists.Having worked with Oliver Stone, Anderson may be someone whose intent is to either provoke or marginalize Christians. Rodrick says he used documentaries and youtube to research serial killers.Were a majority of them Bible quoting Christians? It's doubtful. The concept should have given at least some of the actors reason think twice about accepting the roles. Why would Liota give credibility to such a role and not think about the implications? Hollywood actors can be sympathetic toward any one role they are playing, essentially disguising any truly held beliefs so that they can keep working. They can also express approval of a film that they believe in. Some have worked on Christian films where the Christian theme is obvious. Joseph Fiennes was the main actor in a 2003 film on the life of Martin Luther. Is he known in Hollywood as a practicing Lutheran or a Christian? In a tough moral climate like Hollywood, acting in a movie often means getting paid for acting in the movie and nothing more. It also may be that despite recent success for Christian producers and directors, Christians are still an easy target in Hollywood because either they don't complain or they are considered the enemy for their political or moral stance. 2011 Larry Ingram",1,"""The River Murders"" actor uses charismatic church experience to psych for serial killer scenes",1324598400,"12 23,

1447867,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B00596WFE4,MadMacs,"[5, 5]","I really enjoy when Liotta does human. Obviously, I'm referring to its adjective usage. He's so often cast as the psychotic nutter or conniving monster, it's fascinating seeing him display humble and vulnerable; a person grounded with clay feet.There's a real kindness and touching quality to him when he's not being himself, or perhaps this is an aspect of his real self that we don't get to see very often. Whatever the case, and much like his incredible work in the fantastic 2004 film 'Control', I really appreciate these performances.In this production Liotta plays Jack Verdon, a veteran police detective who finds himself at the crux of a series of murders that span the entire country. A brutal serial killer is on the loose and, one way or another, every death tracks back to him. Both his own department and the FBI have taken note - and they're looking for answers that he can't or won't supply. It's the latter option that has irked fellow law enforcement officers and placed suspicion onto Jack's actions, who seems unwilling to fully reveal his relationships to several of the victims.It's clear he's being framed, but who can he trust? And what's really behind all the deaths?The story itself is a cobbled patchwork of other similar films and themes, so don't expect any blindside plot shockers. Instead, if you're interested in seeing an actor going against type, then this fits into an unusual group of films that quietly blends and merges between strict definitions. In many ways this flick deviates from the action/thriller genre, under which it's categorized, and fits more into the character study of productions.Every player on set executed solid performances with no obvious flaws or missteps; the script is reasonable, though uninspired. A passable flick that'll eat up a decent chunk of a rainy/snowy afternoon.Personal Notes:- The casting of Ving Rhames and Christian Slater is depressing evidence that both actors have fallen off the A-List. More surprising for Rhames, much less so for Slater who has long since jumped the shark of his own career.Slater has been a interesting puzzle for me. Every time I've written him off - he stages a brief and memorable comeback. Recently, it was his insanely hilarious neo-hippie character in ""My Name Is Earl"". Undoubtedly impressing more than just myself, because soon thereafter he was given two more shots as lead actor in two different tv series.

When a second body turns up, another woman from his past that Jack slept with, the FBI arrives in the form of agent Vuckovich (Christian Slater), a smart mouthed agent who rubs Jack the wrong way and is constantly being told to back off by Jack's boss Capt. Langley (Ving Rhames). Vuckovich demands that Jack give him a list of all the women he's slept with. The list of 100 names stuns him, but then Jack was free and single for years until he got married.Jack's marriage is doing great. His wife Ana (Gisele Fraga) is a chef who adores her husband. And while a list of 100 women may stun some, she doesn't hold it against him realizing that this was before they were married. But something or someone seems to be missing.As information comes in Jack is cleared of any involvement and instead of suspect officially begins investigating the culprit. Each murder involves one more of Jack's past conquests, each one leaves something else that should be a clue and each one offers a Bible passage that is intended to aid Jack in catching the killer.The clock is ticking and more women are at risk. With each passing day another could fall victim to this killer and several do. Until Jack can face his past and discover how these clues come together the killer will carry on.This movie, made on a small budget, does offer an interesting tale. An allegory for STDs? Perhaps but I doubt it. Instead we have a tale of a man who feels regret, who feels shame and who feels guilt about having people in his past hurt by someone in the present.Liotta does a great job here as one would expect. In recent years, he's been tossed aside into the direct for DVD market, but that only works to help movies in that genre. Slater has also been relegated to that market and done fine as well. In this movie though he's pretty much wasted in a part that should have been bigger.By the end of the film you'll discover who the killer is, be able to piece together the parts of the puzzle that led to him and find a conclusion that will surprise you. Who he is and how he got to be who he's become is interesting and better thought out than most made for DVD mysteries.  It may not be the greatest mystery ever filmed but it will offer an entertaining evening for fans of the genre.",3,PARTNERS IN CRIME,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,3015,"['murderer', 'stalking', 'streets', 'town', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'women', 'been', 'killing', 'have', 'distinct', 'pattern', 'clues', 'behind', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'police', 'know', 'who', 'do', 'realize', 'twisted', 'individual', 'victim', 'wedding', 'ring', 'piece', 'jewelry', 'inserted', 'vaginal', 'area.Ray', 'Liotta', 'Jack', 'Vernon', 'one', 'detectives', 'called', 'first', 'case', 'Jack', 'immediately', 'start', 'when', 'first', 'victim', 'was', 'woman', 'dated', 'years', 'back', 'location', 'body', 'where', 'had', 'sex', 'first', 'time', 'top', 'suspect', 'list.Told', 'stay', 'case', 'course', 'ignores', 'instructions', 'looking', 'clues', 'When', 'second', 'body', 'up', 'woman', 'past', 'Jack', 'slept', 'FBI', 'form', 'agent', 'Vuckovich', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'smart', 'mouthed', 'agent', 'who', 'Jack', 'wrong', 'way', 'constantly', 'being', 'told', 'back', 'off', 'Jack', 'boss', 'Capt', 'Langley', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'Vuckovich', 'Jack', 'give', 'list', 'women', 'slept', 'list', '100', 'names', 'stuns', 'then', 'Jack', 'was', 'free', 'single', 'years', 'got', 'married.Jack', 'marriage', 'doing', 'great', 'wife', 'Ana', 'Gisele', 'Fraga', 'chef', 'who', 'husband', 'list', '100', 'women', 'may', 'stun', ""n't"", 'hold', 'realizing', 'was', 'were', 'married', 'something', 'someone', 'be', 'missing.As', 'information', 'Jack', 'cleared', 'involvement', 'instead', 'suspect', 'officially', 'investigating', 'culprit', 'murder', 'one', 'more', 'Jack', 'past', 'conquests', 'one', 'something', 'else', 'should', 'be', 'clue', 'one', 'Bible', 'passage', 'intended', 'aid', 'Jack', 'catching', 'killer.The', 'clock', 'ticking', 'more', 'women', 'are', 'risk', 'passing', 'day', 'could', 'fall', 'victim', 'killer', 'several', 'do', 'Jack', 'can', 'face', 'past', 'discover', 'how', 'clues', 'come', 'together', 'killer', 'will', 'carry', 'on.This', 'movie', 'made', 'small', 'budget', 'offer', 'interesting', 'tale', 'allegory', 'STDs', 'Perhaps', 'doubt', 'Instead', 'have', 'tale', 'man', 'who', 'regret', 'who', 'shame', 'who', 'feels', 'guilt', 'having', 'people', 'past', 'hurt', 'someone', 'present.Liotta', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'recent', 'years', 'been', 'tossed', 'aside', 'direct', 'DVD', 'market', 'only', 'help', 'movies', 'genre', 'Slater', 'also', 'been', 'relegated', 'market', 'done', 'fine', 'well', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'wasted', 'part', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'film', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'who', 'killer', 'be', 'able', 'piece', 'together', 'parts', 'puzzle', 'led', 'find', 'conclusion', 'will', 'surprise', 'Who', 'how', 'got', 'be', 'who', 'become', 'interesting', 'better', 'thought', 'out', 'most', 'made', 'DVD', 'mysteries', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'greatest', 'mystery', 'ever', 'filmed', 'will', 'offer', 'entertaining', 'evening', 'fans', 'genre']",The River Murders

Unfortunately, some of his exes are being gruesomely murdered.  Is Liotta the killer?  That's the dilemma in this slow-moving but intriguing B-movie.Even though the killer's identity is revealed early on, his motivation is concealed but obvious at the same time.Liotta, so good in GOODFELLAS and NARC, gives an oddly uneven performance, bouncing all over the place, underacting key scenes and overacting in lower-key moments.  He has little chemistry with his wife, an underwhelming Gisele Fragas, but has some good scenes with Ving Rhames, who is wasted as his partner.  Christian Slater drops by between his cancelled TV series to caricaturize an FBI profiler.  Michael Rodrick as the disturbed John is the most effective performer, his pretty boy looks masking a dark secret.  The religious overtone of the film is accentuated by a haunting musical score and there is some lovely Washington state scenery, even though it's always raining.THE RIVER MURDERS often plays like an episode of 48 HOURS MYSTERY, but I got involved in its script, despite the movie's obvious flaws.

1447873,A387BD735MI50R,B00596WFE4,R. Schultz,"[0, 0]","The guesswork in this film doesn't involve who dun it. We're shown the polite, pervasive serial killer early on. More of the guesswork revolves around why he dun it, and most of all - how he dun it. How could he know the most intimate details of the life of the detective he has targeted? How could the killer know every sexual encounter that now-mature detective had, going all the way back to high school? How could he know not only the identity of so many of the detective's many one-night stands, but also the location of each encounter?Unfortunately, the movie becomes its own spoiler. It reveals the answer to this question about half-way through. If you aren't listening carefully, you might miss this revelation, which is made in a few incidental sentences. It's too bad that the writer decided to make this an almost throw-away part of the plot. This would have been a better movie if the killer's method of knowing had been made the heart of the film's mystery. It involves some very telling psychological insight.There are other ways in which this movie could have been somewhat better. Once again, so much of the action centers on the clich&eacute; of the different investigators' antagonism toward each other. Christian Slater, playing the FBI agent brought in on the case, is especially irritating in his automatic, over-the-top vituperations. It all makes you long for the likes of the old Dragnet and Columbo TV series, where more often than not, there was some level of respect and cooperation between the officers working on a case. Those plots weren't padded with pointless volleys of cursing.Then the movie is somewhat marred by the inherent sexism of its plot. The detective whose exes are being picked off is asked to come up with a list of all his encounters. He judges there to be in excess of 100, and can't complete the list, either because he can't remember all his ""dates,"" or because he wants to be discrete about certain in-house alliances, however dangerous such discretion might be for the women involved.The real sexism though comes through when we see many of the victims being absolutely, abjectly helpless once they are caught by the killer, even while they remain uninjured and unbound. One in particular remains inexplicably cringing on a bed while the killer turns his back to her and becomes absorbed in ranting out his rationale for his crimes. Why doesn't the woman even try to get away at this point? But she and other victims don't move. They seem to be transfixed into acceptance of their fate by the mere presence of a malevolent male figure.There are two full-length commentaries on this DVD - one that includes the director, and one that includes the writer and some of the actors. I was hoping to find some discussion of these issues here. I was hoping to hear some conversation about the trouble they faced keeping Ray Liotta's character sympathetic, despite his history of one-night stands. But there isn't any such deeper discussion. Most of the commentaries consist of technical details about where blue screen was used, of rather fatuous mutual admiration, of the narration of hijinks on the set, and other such trivialities. So unless you have an unlimited amount of time, you can probably skip these extras.Just watch the movie and take it for what it is - a somewhat suspenseful, upped version of a CSI episode, with some otherwise brilliant actors performing in these less radiant roles.",3,Has You Guessing,1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,3445,"['guesswork', 'film', ""n't"", 'involve', 'who', 'dun', ""'re"", 'shown', 'polite', 'pervasive', 'serial', 'killer', 'early', 'More', 'guesswork', 'around', 'why', 'most', 'how', 'How', 'could', 'know', 'most', 'intimate', 'details', 'life', 'detective', 'targeted', 'How', 'could', 'killer', 'know', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'now-mature', 'detective', 'had', 'going', 'way', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'How', 'could', 'know', 'not', 'only', 'identity', 'so', 'many', 'detective', 'many', 'one-night', 'stands', 'also', 'location', 'encounter', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'own', 'spoiler', 'answer', 'question', 'half-way', 'are', ""n't"", 'listening', 'carefully', 'might', 'miss', 'revelation', 'made', 'few', 'incidental', 'sentences', 'too', 'bad', 'writer', 'decided', 'make', 'almost', 'throw-away', 'part', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'killer', 'method', 'knowing', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'heart', 'film', 'mystery', 'very', 'telling', 'psychological', 'insight.There', 'are', 'other', 'ways', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'better', 'Once', 'again', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'centers', 'clich', 'eacute', 'different', 'investigators', 'antagonism', 'other', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'playing', 'FBI', 'agent', 'brought', 'case', 'especially', 'irritating', 'automatic', 'over-the-top', 'vituperations', 'long', 'likes', 'old', 'Dragnet', 'Columbo', 'TV', 'series', 'where', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'was', 'level', 'respect', 'cooperation', 'officers', 'working', 'case', 'plots', 'were', ""n't"", 'padded', 'pointless', 'volleys', 'cursing.Then', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'marred', 'inherent', 'sexism', 'plot', 'detective', 'exes', 'are', 'being', 'picked', 'off', 'asked', 'come', 'up', 'list', 'encounters', 'judges', 'there', 'be', 'excess', '100', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complete', 'list', 'either', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'dates', 'be', 'discrete', 'certain', 'in-house', 'alliances', 'however', 'dangerous', 'such', 'discretion', 'might', 'be', 'women', 'involved.The', 'real', 'sexism', 'when', 'see', 'many', 'victims', 'being', 'absolutely', 'abjectly', 'helpless', 'are', 'caught', 'killer', 'even', 'remain', 'uninjured', 'unbound', 'One', 'particular', 'remains', 'inexplicably', 'cringing', 'bed', 'killer', 'back', 'absorbed', 'ranting', 'out', 'rationale', 'crimes', 'Why', ""n't"", 'woman', 'even', 'try', 'get', 'away', 'point', 'other', 'victims', 'do', ""n't"", 'move', 'seem', 'be', 'transfixed', 'acceptance', 'fate', 'mere', 'presence', 'malevolent', 'male', 'are', 'two', 'full-length', 'commentaries', 'DVD', 'one', 'director', 'one', 'writer', 'actors', 'was', 'hoping', 'find', 'discussion', 'issues', 'here', 'was', 'hoping', 'hear', 'conversation', 'trouble', 'faced', 'keeping', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'history', 'one-night', 'stands', ""n't"", 'such', 'deeper', 'discussion', 'Most', 'commentaries', 'consist', 'technical', 'details', 'where', 'blue', 'screen', 'was', 'used', 'rather', 'fatuous', 'mutual', 'admiration', 'narration', 'hijinks', 'set', 'other', 'such', 'trivialities', 'So', 'have', 'unlimited', 'amount', 'time', 'can', 'probably', 'skip', 'extras.Just', 'watch', 'movie', 'take', 'what', 'somewhat', 'suspenseful', 'upped', 'version', 'CSI', 'episode', 'otherwise', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'performing', 'less', 'radiant', 'roles']",The River Murders
