His innovative use of sound, imagery and outrageous sight gags made for incredibly funny viewing.  His characters were priceless.  &quot;Percy Dovetonsils&quot; was one of  the very first pseudo-gay characters whose wonderful takes to the camera  were a scream, especially that syrupy smirk he got on his face.  Eugene was  a character played entirely in pantomime.  The Nairobi Trio is, perhaps  Ernies' most famous contribution to comic lore with three band members in  long coats, hairy ape masks and derbys playing in a band to the music of  the Ray Charles Singers (why they made this recording will never be known)  but it is perfect for Ernie's motives.

So much of Ernie's TV tech stuff was 100% visual, it was tantamount to viewing a series of silent films.And we remember that silent movies had musical accompaniment.  Ernie had to furnish music which would at once associate itself with the ruthlessly original visual imagery and also be, hopefully, something we'd not heard before.He scoured the globe for 1950s-era music that you'd never heard before.  For example, even fifty years later, I cannot hear the version of ""Jalousie"" on this CD without seeing the ""office equipment"" visuals he made.  And I'd be grateful for a plateful of fish.Ernie's outlook on things has warped me for life.  He made the fifties what they were.  There would not be a Saurday Night Live but for his influence.Now, here's the ""but.""  This collection is better than no collection at all, but not much better.

But more that that, I think that people need to see more of Ernie Kovacs' genius. Here was a man with more savvy about what television could do to entertain -- and an understanding of what it could and would become -- than any network programming executive, ever! Most of what's on the DVD is timeless. Unless you only think what's on the WB is actually funny, then get this. Now having said that, I want to make a request. Pester the studios for more of Ernie's work. Write to distributors and demand that for every &quot;Sleazy Coeds in Toxic Appartments of Death&quot; they release that they should also release a &quot;Wake Me When It's Over&quot; or an &quot;Operation Mad Ball&quot; with Ernie Kovacs. The second one, BTW, also stars Jack Lemmon: a double treat. Even Kovacs; &quot;Sail a Crooked Ship&quot; one of his final performances, is a hoot as is &quot;Five Golden Hours,&quot; his last movie. Sure, these movies aren't his writing, but he brought an irreverance to the roles that make them a joy to watch, much more so than &quot;Beat Billy Jack to Death with a Bat, Part 7!&quot; And as for this DVD, I think it's as important as The Sid Ceasar Collection as a great TV history lesson we all could use.",5,Demand More Ernie Kovacs!,986774400,"04 9, 2001",2001,1304,"['majority', 'reviewers', 'DVD', 'have', 'great', 'things', 'say', 'more', 'think', 'people', 'need', 'see', 'more', 'Ernie', 'Kovacs', 'genius', 'Here', 'was', 'man', 'more', 'savvy', 'what', 'television', 'could', 'do', 'entertain', 'understanding', 'what', 'could', 'would', 'become', 'network', 'programming', 'executive', 'ever', 'Most', 'what', 'DVD', 'timeless', 'only', 'think', 'what', 'WB', 'actually', 'funny', 'then', 'get', 'Now', 'having', 'said', 'want', 'make', 'request', 'Pester', 'studios', 'more', 'Ernie', 'work', 'Write', 'distributors', 'demand', 'quot', 'Sleazy', 'Coeds', 'Toxic', 'Appartments', 'Death', 'quot', 'release', 'should', 'also', 'release', 'quot', 'Wake', 'Me', 'When', 'Over', 'quot', 'quot', 'Operation', 'Mad', 'Ball', 'quot', 'Ernie', 'Kovacs', 'second', 'one', 'BTW', 'also', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'double', 'treat', 'Even', 'Kovacs', 'quot', 'Sail', 'Crooked', 'Ship', 'quot', 'one', 'final', 'performances', 'hoot', 'quot', 'Five', 'Golden', 'Hours', 'quot', 'last', 'movie', 'Sure', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'writing', 'brought', 'irreverance', 'roles', 'make', 'joy', 'watch', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'quot', 'Beat', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'Death', 'Bat', 'Part', '7', 'quot', 'DVD', 'think', 'as', 'important', 'Sid', 'Ceasar', 'Collection', 'great', 'TV', 'history', 'lesson', 'could', 'use']",N/A

Seeing this material again for me after almost twenty years was like visiting an old friend and catching up on great times.  I would caution those just discovering Kovacs, however, that some of this DVD is not side-splittingly funny in a conventional sense; rather, much of it is gently humorous and cerebral. Mostly, it is fascinating - incredibly surreal (still the most surreal stuff EVER seen on television) and way, WAY ahead of its' time; much of Kovacs work remains indescribable and uncategoriazable.  Having said that, characters such as Percy Dovetonsils and the Nairobi Trio will have even the most jaded viewer chuckling, if not laughing out loud at the sheer outrageousness of these images.  Keeping in mind when these shows were made (late 50's/early 60's) Kovacs' body of work remains among the most subversive ever done for network television.  By the way, Kovacs solemnly intoning a scene from Julius Ceaser, dressed in full Roman centurian regalia, and then breaking into a tap-dance is still one of the funniest things that I have ever seen.
