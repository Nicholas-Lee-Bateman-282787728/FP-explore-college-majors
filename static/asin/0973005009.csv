167534,ARKBPMMM8DPTH,0973005009,"Bobandy ""Mr. Lahey's Pool Boy""","[3, 3]","This documentary perfectly captures the passion, humor, and animostiy of the main champions of Bigfoot in his modern form.  Rene Dahinden (now deceased) is his gruff, yet cheerful self as he gleefully explains why the other three ""elders"" have failed to produce definitive proof.  One gets the impression that for Dahinden, Bigfoot is primarily a vehicle to tear down people of percieved authority, while sticking up for the underdog.  He was a fascinating character, and one of the first to seriosuly hunt the legendary being.Next is Peter Byrne, who treats the whole affair with quiet, bemused reservation. He entertains nerdy kids who want to study ""migration patterns"" and talk about Bigfoot living underground.  Hey, if it fosters an interest in the natural world among our increasingly sedentary, urban youngsters, more power to him.  Byrne seems to realize that there's probably no way he'll prove Bigfoot exists, so he's content to retell stories of yore and enjoy short excursions into the woods...nothing wrong with that.  Byrne seems like the best adjusted of the group.John Greene, the Canadian journalist is on hand to explain why he's right and every single scientist in the world is simply a lazy, good-for-nothing, office-bound nay-sayer when it comes to Bigfoot.  He seems like a tired, bitter old guy who's sick of being ignored, or worse, mocked by those who don't take his every word as gospel when it comes to giant ape-men. Not the kind of guy you'd want to have over for dinner.Finally, Grover Krantz (also deceased) is highlighted.  He refuses to acknowledge that footprints can be faked, films can be hoaxed, and maybe, just maybe he's not as smart as he thinks he is.  Dahinden exposes several faults in Krantz's previous analyses of evidence, but this doesn't phase Krantz in the least.  He's a kindly fellow, a bit gullible, and perhaps arrogant, but in the end, he's a tragic figure who died without seeing any of his theories even remotely supported by hard evidence.The documentary also includes footage of various loonies, oddballs, kooks, and amateur enthusiasts in an amusing, and not at all mean-spirited send-up of the collage of personalities that is Bigfootery.  Overall, this doc is EXCELLENT!  Highly recommended for fans, believers, and skeptics alike.  You'll learn a LOT about the culture of Bigfootery and perhaps gain a bit more understanding of why it seems to thrive depite having very little material support for the hairry monster's existence to go on.A ++++",5,"Excellent Overview of Modern Bigfootery's ""Four Horsemen""",1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,2507,"['perfectly', 'passion', 'humor', 'animostiy', 'main', 'champions', 'Bigfoot', 'modern', 'form', 'Rene', 'Dahinden', 'now', 'deceased', 'gruff', 'yet', 'cheerful', 'self', 'gleefully', 'why', 'other', 'three', 'elders', 'have', 'failed', 'produce', 'definitive', 'proof', 'One', 'impression', 'Dahinden', 'Bigfoot', 'primarily', 'vehicle', 'tear', 'down', 'people', 'percieved', 'authority', 'sticking', 'up', 'underdog', 'was', 'fascinating', 'character', 'one', 'first', 'seriosuly', 'legendary', 'being.Next', 'Peter', 'Byrne', 'who', 'whole', 'affair', 'quiet', 'bemused', 'reservation', 'nerdy', 'kids', 'who', 'want', 'study', 'migration', 'patterns', 'talk', 'Bigfoot', 'living', 'underground', 'Hey', 'interest', 'natural', 'world', 'increasingly', 'sedentary', 'urban', 'youngsters', 'more', 'power', 'Byrne', 'realize', 'probably', 'way', ""'ll"", 'prove', 'Bigfoot', 'exists', 'content', 'retell', 'stories', 'yore', 'enjoy', 'short', 'excursions', 'woods', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Byrne', 'best', 'adjusted', 'group.John', 'Greene', 'Canadian', 'journalist', 'hand', 'explain', 'why', 'right', 'single', 'scientist', 'world', 'simply', 'lazy', 'good-for-nothing', 'office-bound', 'nay-sayer', 'when', 'Bigfoot', 'tired', 'bitter', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'sick', 'being', 'ignored', 'worse', 'mocked', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'word', 'gospel', 'when', 'giant', 'ape-men', 'Not', 'kind', 'guy', ""'d"", 'want', 'have', 'over', 'dinner.Finally', 'Grover', 'Krantz', 'also', 'deceased', 'highlighted', 'acknowledge', 'footprints', 'can', 'be', 'faked', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'hoaxed', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'not', 'as', 'smart', 'Dahinden', 'several', 'faults', 'Krantz', 'previous', 'analyses', 'evidence', ""n't"", 'phase', 'Krantz', 'least', 'kindly', 'fellow', 'bit', 'gullible', 'perhaps', 'arrogant', 'end', 'tragic', 'figure', 'who', 'died', 'seeing', 'theories', 'even', 'remotely', 'supported', 'hard', 'evidence.The', 'documentary', 'also', 'footage', 'various', 'loonies', 'oddballs', 'kooks', 'amateur', 'enthusiasts', 'amusing', 'not', 'mean-spirited', 'send-up', 'collage', 'personalities', 'Bigfootery', 'Overall', 'doc', 'EXCELLENT', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'believers', 'skeptics', 'alike', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'LOT', 'culture', 'Bigfootery', 'perhaps', 'gain', 'bit', 'more', 'understanding', 'why', 'thrive', 'depite', 'having', 'very', 'little', 'material', 'support', 'hairry', 'monster', 'existence', 'go', 'on.A', '++++']",Sasquatch Odyssey: The Hunt for Bigfoot VHS

This is an excellent documentary that places it's focus, not so much on bigfoot, but on the people who have made a name searching for it. At times it is humorous (especially the segments with Rene Dahinden), and at others times very serious. It shows the directions the four ""old men"" of bigfoot search and research have taken since working together as young men, and the contempt they seem to have for each other now. I found myself feeling sorry for the men when they realize they are getting old and have never seen bigfoot and probably will not live to see it. But it is encouraging to see younger people take up the search in an attempt to carry on.I, for one, am a believer and hope that one day proof positive is presented to the sceptical world, but at the same time I hope bigfoot is left right where he is. One of the viewpoints brought up is that bigfoot does not have to be shot and the body dragged in for us to realize he exists and always has been out there.This is a great bigfoot film, and you should buy it, if you're interested.",5,Excellent !,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,1136,"['bought', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'video', 'tape', 'have', 'watched', 'least', '10', 'times', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'focus', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bigfoot', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'name', 'searching', 'times', 'humorous', 'especially', 'segments', 'Rene', 'Dahinden', 'others', 'times', 'very', 'serious', 'directions', 'four', 'old', 'men', 'bigfoot', 'search', 'research', 'have', 'taken', 'working', 'together', 'young', 'men', 'contempt', 'seem', 'have', 'other', 'now', 'found', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'men', 'when', 'realize', 'are', 'getting', 'old', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'bigfoot', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'live', 'see', 'encouraging', 'see', 'younger', 'people', 'take', 'up', 'search', 'attempt', 'carry', 'on.I', 'one', 'am', 'believer', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'proof', 'positive', 'presented', 'sceptical', 'world', 'same', 'time', 'hope', 'bigfoot', 'left', 'right', 'where', 'One', 'viewpoints', 'brought', 'up', 'bigfoot', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'shot', 'body', 'dragged', 'realize', 'always', 'been', 'out', 'there.This', 'great', 'bigfoot', 'film', 'should', 'buy', ""'re"", 'interested']",Sasquatch Odyssey: The Hunt for Bigfoot VHS
167538,A2BKFOS8V9ZRAW,0973005009,H.M. 2005,"[0, 0]","A great documentary about the Grand Old Men of BigfooteryI saw this documentary originally on video, presented as the original 70-minute documentary shown on television. This DVD, while it presents the original documentary, also has new segments, such as 3 short vignettes with Stan Winston (Aliens, Terminator 2) with him commenting that the Patterson/Gimlin film is most likely a brilliant hoax. There's a new question-and-answer segment with Bigfoot researcher Richard Noll in which he discusses his thoughts on Bigfoot and the Bigfoot field in general. It also shows him in the field finding a set of tracks. There is also a photo gallery featuring the four principles of the documentary. This documentary features the story of the four Grand Old Men of Bigfootery, John Green, Rene Dahinden, Peter Byrne and Grover Krantz, featuring classic footage of each man, which tells the story of each man's quest to find the Sasquatch. Two of the men (Krantz and Dahinden) have passed on since the filming of this documentary, but of the four, only Green continues to be semi-active in the hunt. Byrne is semi-retired and laregly out of the public spotlight.

167541,A1D702T7C8VDBL,0973005009,"R. Howell ""boriskhan""","[5, 7]","As stated by others, this documentary is about two things - bigfoot and the four horsemen of sasquatchary (John Green, Rene Dahinden, Grover Krantz, & Peter Byrne). This is a well done piece, giving time to each of the four men. They talk about bigfoot and Dahinden tries to give an explanation of why the four of them didn't get along. Their in-fighting is amusing and their personalities come out here. Krantz the scientist, John Green the journalist, Dahinden the seemingly bitter every man, and Byrne the playboy hunter. Two of them are dead now (Krantz and Dahinden) and the other two (Green & Byrne) are getting on in years. Most amusing is how all four of them dismiss John Lesparitis as a dimwit regarding bigfoot.Among other personalities in the show are Ray Crowe, Larry Lund, John Lesparitis, State Trooper Hastings, John Bindernagel (seen but never heard), Robert Pyle, newcomer Henry Franzoni, and Byrne disciple 15 year old Matt ""and stuff"" Dunlap among others. We also get FX designer Toby Lindala's input on the Patterson film creature. It's a good solid show for the subject matter.Special Features for the dvd include a 10 minute segment on bigfoot background guy Richard Noll (now coming to the forefront as the Four Horsemen are departing us). Also are three brief opinion segments including FX designer Stan Winston and an old movie actor that impersonated gorillas.Overall, very good show but more about the Big Four than Bigfoot.",4,Bigfoot & the Four Horsemen,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,1452,"['stated', 'others', 'documentary', 'two', 'things', 'bigfoot', 'four', 'horsemen', 'sasquatchary', 'John', 'Green', 'Rene', 'Dahinden', 'Grover', 'Krantz', 'Peter', 'Byrne', 'well', 'done', 'piece', 'giving', 'time', 'four', 'men', 'talk', 'bigfoot', 'Dahinden', 'tries', 'give', 'explanation', 'why', 'four', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'in-fighting', 'amusing', 'personalities', 'come', 'out', 'here', 'Krantz', 'scientist', 'John', 'Green', 'journalist', 'Dahinden', 'seemingly', 'bitter', 'man', 'Byrne', 'playboy', 'hunter', 'Two', 'are', 'dead', 'now', 'Krantz', 'Dahinden', 'other', 'two', 'Green', 'Byrne', 'are', 'getting', 'years', 'Most', 'amusing', 'how', 'four', 'dismiss', 'John', 'Lesparitis', 'dimwit', 'regarding', 'other', 'personalities', 'show', 'are', 'Ray', 'Crowe', 'Larry', 'Lund', 'John', 'Lesparitis', 'State', 'Trooper', 'Hastings', 'John', 'Bindernagel', 'seen', 'never', 'heard', 'Robert', 'Pyle', 'newcomer', 'Henry', 'Franzoni', 'Byrne', 'disciple', '15', 'year', 'old', 'Matt', 'stuff', 'Dunlap', 'others', 'also', 'get', 'FX', 'designer', 'Toby', 'Lindala', 'input', 'Patterson', 'film', 'creature', 'good', 'solid', 'show', 'subject', 'matter.Special', 'Features', 'dvd', 'include', '10', 'minute', 'segment', 'bigfoot', 'background', 'guy', 'Richard', 'Noll', 'now', 'coming', 'forefront', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'are', 'departing', 'Also', 'are', 'three', 'brief', 'opinion', 'segments', 'including', 'FX', 'designer', 'Stan', 'Winston', 'old', 'movie', 'actor', 'impersonated', 'gorillas.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'more', 'Big', 'Four', 'Bigfoot']",Sasquatch Odyssey: The Hunt for Bigfoot VHS
