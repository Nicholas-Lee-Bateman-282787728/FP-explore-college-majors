1603060,A1JN63QBBNGB78,B009XJ5ED2,Amazon Customer,"[3, 6]","Why is it that when a good show comes along, the ""numb nuts"" powers that be feel inclined to cancel it?  The series was well written and the acting by the major players was believeable.  It was also a show you could sit and watch and enjoy without hearing the ""F"" word used in nearly every sentence.  Has it gotten so bad that in today's society, people can't carry on a normal conversation without using the ""F"" word? Guess too that there wasn't enough T&A;, sexually explicit and/or humping or biracial face sucking scenes to suit them.  Will they never learn that they don't need this type of content to produce a show that will be popular with the audience majority?  Any show that contains the elements described above is offensive to many, many people and is certainly not one that is suitable for family viewing.  I for one can't hit the remote fast enough when such a program comes on.  I'm not a prude but I for one am totally fed up with the trashy TV shows that are consistently being shoved in our faces each and every night.  That goes for the commercials too.Listen up you dummies that cancelled this series.

Though the show has been cancelled, don't let that keep you from viewing the many episodes. There's an exciting energy in the show, and it's quite interesting to watch the various medical situations/emergencies. In that respect, the series is fairly educational. I found myself pausing and looking up various conditions that arise in Dr. Holt's medical practice. There's some social responsibility themes as well... the primary conflict is uptown neurologist Dr. Holt working vigorously in a free clinic in Spanish Harlem.Did I mention that Patrick Wilson is good looking... a bit on the line of Paul Newman?",5,Cancelled but a Good Show,1355616000,"12 16, 2012",2012,734,"['First', 'foremost', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'lead', 'character', 'good', 'actor', 'good', 'looking', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'show', 'been', 'cancelled', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'keep', 'viewing', 'many', 'episodes', 'exciting', 'energy', 'show', 'quite', 'interesting', 'watch', 'various', 'medical', 'situations/emergencies', 'respect', 'series', 'fairly', 'educational', 'found', 'pausing', 'looking', 'up', 'various', 'conditions', 'arise', 'Dr.', 'Holt', 'medical', 'practice', 'social', 'responsibility', 'themes', 'as', 'well', 'primary', 'conflict', 'uptown', 'neurologist', 'Dr.', 'Holt', 'working', 'vigorously', 'free', 'clinic', 'Spanish', 'Harlem.Did', 'mention', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'good', 'looking', 'bit', 'line', 'Paul', 'Newman']",A Gifted Man

It's never explained why this should make any kind of sense - just accept it and move on and watch how she menaces him into to sacrificing the care of his own patients and to instead see to her seemingly more deserving patients. Actually, pretty much all the recurring characters do the same. The people working at his ex-wife's inferior clinic treat him horribly - a bombardment of snide remarks and a showering of guilt - for what I don't know since it is never explained what he has done wrong or why he seemingly owes everybody or why people who can pay a doctor are worthy of hostility while those who can't are deserving of the best of the best literally because they don't have the money to pay for it. It's all too bizarre.It's like the writers created a character to punish into submission and I have no doubt they made sure he submitted although I didn't watch past the second episode. It was just too sick to continue.I enjoy interesting medical shows and was told if I liked 'House' I would like this show but that is ridiculous. House would have never succeeded if the main character was treated like the man in this show but I would love to see the character of Dr. House respond to the supporting cast of A Gifted Man. Now that would be an entertaining show.I'm glad there were not enough people to accept, ignore, or be entertained by the twisted message of this show and that it was canceled while shows like Bones, Lie to Me,  and House with brilliant and unapologetic characters have done so well.",1,A sadistic exercise in how much pressure one person can take?,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,1680,"['extremely', 'skilled', 'neurosurgeon', 'haunted', 'deceased', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'how', 'should', 'dedicate', 'life', 'job', 'was', 'doing', 'died', 'never', 'explained', 'why', 'should', 'make', 'kind', 'sense', 'just', 'move', 'watch', 'how', 'sacrificing', 'care', 'own', 'patients', 'instead', 'see', 'seemingly', 'more', 'deserving', 'patients', 'Actually', 'pretty', 'much', 'recurring', 'characters', 'do', 'same', 'people', 'working', 'ex-wife', 'inferior', 'clinic', 'treat', 'horribly', 'bombardment', 'snide', 'remarks', 'showering', 'guilt', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'never', 'explained', 'what', 'done', 'wrong', 'why', 'seemingly', 'everybody', 'why', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'pay', 'doctor', 'are', 'worthy', 'hostility', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'are', 'deserving', 'best', 'best', 'literally', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'pay', 'too', 'bizarre.It', 'writers', 'created', 'character', 'punish', 'submission', 'have', 'doubt', 'made', 'sure', 'submitted', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'second', 'episode', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'sick', 'continue.I', 'enjoy', 'interesting', 'medical', 'shows', 'was', 'told', 'liked', 'would', 'like', 'show', 'ridiculous', 'House', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'succeeded', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'treated', 'man', 'show', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'character', 'Dr.', 'House', 'respond', 'supporting', 'cast', 'A', 'Gifted', 'Man', 'Now', 'would', 'be', 'entertaining', 'show.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'people', 'accept', 'ignore', 'be', 'entertained', 'twisted', 'message', 'show', 'was', 'canceled', 'shows', 'Bones', 'Lie', 'Me', 'House', 'brilliant', 'unapologetic', 'characters', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'well']",A Gifted Man
