Starting from the box, disk cases and disks, everything is very good.  I enjoyed seeing how this show was originally intended to be (watched the edited version for South America).

I watched it every morning before school when I was a kid and I must say I'm having a blast watching it again.  The bluray looks pretty good for a show that came out thirty years ago.  The only complaint I might have is that they didn't stick with the original voice overs for the english language option.  I seem to remember it sounding a little different back then.  But all in all I think it was a good buy, I definitely got my moneys worth.

1660402,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B00DPH7S82,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","One of my earliest childhood memories was watching Battle of the Planets which ran in the United States in 1978. What really set the cartoon apart from American cartoons was the maturity of the plots. There was a two-parter, which looking back I believe was the storyline &#8216;The Sky is Falling!, where Mark left the team to search for his father that made a huge impression on me. This is a story that would never occur in a cartoon like the Superfriends. As far as I was concerned Casey Kasem WAS G-Force leader Mark end of story. The cartoon was only available to me for a few seasons at most and it wasn&#8217;t until I was a young adult that I started to search for a means to revisit the cartoon but it was locked up thanks to multiple companies claiming U.S. distribution rights. The only way to see the cartoons was to watch bootleg VHS tapes passed around by fans. Then in 2001 all the stars came into alignment and Battle of the Planets was finally released on DVD in the U.S.  by Rhino Videos but perhaps interest wasn&#8217;t enough because they only rereleased less than 30 episodes.In 2005 the original uncut redubbed Gatchaman anime were released and it was a revelation.  7 Zark 7 was a fraud, Galactor was composed of humans not aliens from Spectra and Casey Kasem was entirely inappropriate as the voice of Mark, I mean Ken. The violence was exponentially higher and the stories more serious. The downside was it was 18 discs which take up a lot of space. So now we have the ultimate set; Gatchaman on Blu-ray which not only collects the 105 episodes but also the 1994 OVA which I particularly enjoyed. There are 14 discs but each case holds multiple discs so there are only 3 discs total. I had most but not all of the DVD Gatchaman but gave most of them away including the OVA which meant the total volume of my collection was slashed considerably.So why would anyone who owns the Gatchaman DVD want to switch to this collection? Here are my top reasons.1. Gatchaman is a great cartoon. The animation is way primitive but like Star Trek the Original Series it survives on writing. These are HD discs but the cartoons are 40 years old and you just are not going to get pristine images. They are, however, the best available.2. The current Amazon price of $75 is a steal. That upfront cost may sound steep but if you had paid the listed price of $15 dollars for all 18 DVD discs it would have run you $270 bucks plus the OVA. Even at the manufacturers price of $150 it&#8217;s still a deal compared to buying all the DVD&#8217;s. For that cost you get 2770 hours of entertainment.3. The reduction in space was what sold it for me. I&#8217;m moving next month and I&#8217;ve been trying to reduce my volume of STUFF. The blu-ray collection occupies less than 1/6th the space of the 18 volumes plus OVA so I decided to go with the upgrade.4. Let me repeat my first reason. This is a great cartoon. When you watch the series start to finish you see that it&#8217;s much more than a mecha of the week. The characters and emotions feel real. It starts with just a fight between the five member science ninja team and Galactor but as things progress the anger and frustration boils over on both sides. The initially stoic Ken becomes less and less controlled as his fury towards Galactor and Berg Katse boils over. Meanwhile Leader X&#8217;s patience with Katse&#8217;s continual failure increasingly wears thin even as Katse grows more desperate to destroy the science ninja team. It all builds to an amazing series conclusion. At about 23 minutes per episode and 105 episodes we&#8217;re talking over 40 hours of buildup.",5,One of the All Time Great Anime,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,3638,"['One', 'earliest', 'childhood', 'memories', 'was', 'watching', 'Battle', 'Planets', 'ran', 'United', 'States', '1978', 'What', 'really', 'set', 'cartoon', 'apart', 'American', 'cartoons', 'was', 'maturity', 'plots', 'was', 'two-parter', 'looking', 'back', 'believe', 'was', 'storyline', '8216', 'Sky', 'Falling', 'where', 'Mark', 'left', 'team', 'search', 'father', 'made', 'huge', 'impression', 'story', 'would', 'never', 'occur', 'cartoon', 'Superfriends', 'As', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', 'Casey', 'Kasem', 'WAS', 'G-Force', 'leader', 'Mark', 'end', 'story', 'cartoon', 'was', 'only', 'available', 'few', 'seasons', 'most', 'wasn', '8217', 'was', 'young', 'adult', 'started', 'search', 'means', 'revisit', 'cartoon', 'was', 'locked', 'up', 'thanks', 'multiple', 'companies', 'claiming', 'U.S.', 'distribution', 'rights', 'only', 'way', 'see', 'cartoons', 'was', 'watch', 'bootleg', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'passed', 'fans', 'Then', '2001', 'stars', 'came', 'alignment', 'Battle', 'Planets', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'DVD', 'U.S.', 'Rhino', 'Videos', 'perhaps', 'interest', 'wasn', '8217', 'enough', 'only', 'rereleased', 'less', '30', 'episodes.In', '2005', 'original', 'uncut', 'redubbed', 'Gatchaman', 'anime', 'were', 'released', 'was', 'revelation', '7', 'Zark', '7', 'was', 'fraud', 'Galactor', 'was', 'composed', 'humans', 'not', 'aliens', 'Spectra', 'Casey', 'Kasem', 'was', 'entirely', 'inappropriate', 'voice', 'Mark', 'mean', 'Ken', 'violence', 'was', 'exponentially', 'higher', 'stories', 'more', 'serious', 'downside', 'was', 'was', '18', 'discs', 'take', 'up', 'lot', 'space', 'So', 'now', 'have', 'ultimate', 'set', 'Gatchaman', 'Blu-ray', 'not', 'only', '105', 'episodes', 'also', '1994', 'OVA', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'are', '14', 'discs', 'case', 'multiple', 'discs', 'are', 'only', '3', 'discs', 'total', 'had', 'most', 'not', 'DVD', 'Gatchaman', 'gave', 'most', 'away', 'including', 'OVA', 'meant', 'total', 'volume', 'collection', 'was', 'slashed', 'considerably.So', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'who', 'Gatchaman', 'DVD', 'want', 'switch', 'collection', 'Here', 'are', 'top', 'reasons.1', 'Gatchaman', 'great', 'cartoon', 'animation', 'way', 'primitive', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Original', 'Series', 'writing', 'are', 'HD', 'discs', 'cartoons', 'are', '40', 'years', 'old', 'just', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'pristine', 'images', 'are', 'however', 'best', 'available.2', 'current', 'Amazon', 'price', '75', 'steal', 'upfront', 'cost', 'may', 'sound', 'steep', 'had', 'paid', 'listed', 'price', '15', 'dollars', '18', 'DVD', 'discs', 'would', 'have', 'run', '270', 'bucks', 'OVA', 'Even', 'manufacturers', 'price', '150', '8217', 's', 'still', 'deal', 'compared', 'buying', 'DVD', '8217', 's.', 'cost', 'get', '2770', 'hours', 'entertainment.3', 'reduction', 'space', 'was', 'what', 'sold', '8217', 'moving', 'next', 'month', '8217', 'been', 'trying', 'reduce', 'volume', 'STUFF', 'blu-ray', 'collection', 'less', '1/6th', 'space', '18', 'volumes', 'OVA', 'decided', 'go', 'upgrade.4', 'Let', 'repeat', 'first', 'reason', 'great', 'cartoon', 'When', 'watch', 'series', 'start', 'finish', 'see', '8217', 's', 'much', 'more', 'mecha', 'week', 'characters', 'emotions', 'feel', 'real', 'just', 'fight', 'five', 'member', 'science', 'ninja', 'team', 'Galactor', 'things', 'anger', 'frustration', 'boils', 'sides', 'initially', 'stoic', 'Ken', 'less', 'less', 'controlled', 'fury', 'towards', 'Galactor', 'Berg', 'Katse', 'over', 'Meanwhile', 'Leader', 'X', '8217', 's', 'patience', 'Katse', '8217', 'continual', 'failure', 'increasingly', 'thin', 'even', 'Katse', 'more', 'desperate', 'destroy', 'science', 'ninja', 'team', 'builds', 'amazing', 'series', 'conclusion', '23', 'minutes', 'episode', '105', 'episodes', '8217', 'talking', '40', 'hours', 'buildup']",N/A

1660404,ACTHUAU2A70DF,B00DPH7S82,"M. Sharpless ""NERV""","[19, 21]","For some reason Best Buy shipped this to me sooner than the tenth of December.  So I will go ahead and review this.First this is the unedited Gatchaman, known mostly in the United States as ""Battle of the Planets"" or ""G-Force: Guardians of Space"".This unedited edition contains all 105 unedited dubbed episodes.  It has wonderful dub work and the voice actors seem to fit the characters rather well.  I have no complaints about the dubbing.  I can say it's a lot better voice work than ""Battle of the Planets"" which made Jinpei a babbling idiot.What does unedited mean?  Simply put, it really is nothing more than what you saw on ""Battle of the Planets"" or ""G-force"", however, this unedited edition of the show does not sugar coat death.  Soldiers of the evil organization the team fights die, unlike the other shows passing them off as robots or the deaths are just softened.  Also the issue of Transgenderism is taken out of the show all together in both ""Battle of the Planets"" and ""G-force"".  In this edition they leave the whole story line in tact with one of the characters transgender nature.  One episode does have nudity, but it's very brief and for the most part forgettable (Its of a young girl showering, with just the backside shown).  Also in the unedited edition their is some cursing, but not enough to really worry about.  Over all, I would still call this kid friendly for a more mature child about the age of 13 on up.  I would give the show a PG-13 rating.The show is listed as 16:9.  Which scared me at fist, but lucky all the episodes are in a 4:3 aspect ratio.  As one review posted the extra's are in 16:9, which I can not figure out why they would do so.  I have not gotten into the extra's as I have the original DVD box sets and seen all the extras already.The picture is outstanding for what it is.  Its old 70ish cartooning, what more can you ask for?  Its crisp and sharp and a good update over the DVDs.  If you have not bought the DVD sets I would definitely pick this copy of the show up as its the best it has ever looked.  To me its not a significant upgrade over the DVD sets to upgrade to the blu-ray like I have done.  If you like the show and hope for ""Gatchaman II"" to be released than buying this set might help in that development process.  From what I know Disney owns ""Eagle Riders"" which was the American adaptation of ""Gatchaman II"" so who knows if it will ever be released in this unedited format.Sound is English: DTS-HD Master Audio Mono.  It sounds good, but again not a significant upgrade over the DVDs.  You got the Japanese tracks as well with subtitles that are huge and fill up the screen.Overall this is the best the show has ever looked, but in my opinion the upgrade is not worth it if you already own the DVD sets.  I bought this because I really like the show, and I wanted to watch it again with better picture and sound.  What I got is better picture and upgraded sound, but not a huge jump from the original DVDs.  If you do not own the DVDs and you want to get into the Science Ninja Teams escapades than this is the set for you.  I wouldn't bother with the DVDs if you own a Blu-Ray player as this is the better format for a newcomer.Another thing note worthy of this release, it contains the OVA episodes remastered and dubbed just like the original show.  Episodes 1-3 of the OVA (Original Video Animation)is now presented unedited and redone.  Which makes this blu-ray a little more attractive to upgrade too even if you do own the original DVDs.Note:  When I say original DVDs, I am talking about the older nine DVD sets released in 2005.  The new DVD set that contains all of the episodes does contain the OVA episodes now.",4,"The Best, but is it upgrade worthy?",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,3694,"['reason', 'Best', 'Buy', 'shipped', 'sooner', 'tenth', 'December', 'So', 'will', 'go', 'ahead', 'review', 'this.First', 'unedited', 'Gatchaman', 'known', 'mostly', 'United', 'States', 'Battle', 'Planets', 'G-Force', 'Guardians', 'Space', '.This', 'unedited', 'edition', '105', 'unedited', 'dubbed', 'episodes', 'wonderful', 'dub', 'work', 'voice', 'actors', 'seem', 'fit', 'characters', 'rather', 'well', 'have', 'complaints', 'dubbing', 'can', 'say', 'lot', 'better', 'voice', 'work', 'Battle', 'Planets', 'made', 'Jinpei', 'babbling', 'idiot.What', 'unedited', 'mean', 'Simply', 'put', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'what', 'saw', 'Battle', 'Planets', 'G-force', 'however', 'unedited', 'edition', 'show', 'not', 'sugar', 'coat', 'death', 'Soldiers', 'evil', 'organization', 'team', 'fights', 'die', 'other', 'shows', 'passing', 'off', 'robots', 'deaths', 'are', 'just', 'softened', 'Also', 'issue', 'Transgenderism', 'taken', 'show', 'together', 'Battle', 'Planets', 'G-force', 'edition', 'leave', 'whole', 'story', 'line', 'tact', 'one', 'characters', 'transgender', 'nature', 'One', 'episode', 'have', 'nudity', 'very', 'brief', 'most', 'part', 'forgettable', 'young', 'girl', 'showering', 'just', 'backside', 'shown', 'Also', 'unedited', 'edition', 'cursing', 'not', 'enough', 'really', 'worry', 'about', 'would', 'still', 'call', 'kid', 'friendly', 'more', 'mature', 'child', 'age', '13', 'would', 'give', 'show', 'PG-13', 'rating.The', 'show', 'listed', '16:9', 'scared', 'fist', 'episodes', 'are', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'one', 'review', 'posted', 'extra', 'are', '16:9', 'can', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'would', 'do', 'so', 'have', 'not', 'gotten', 'extra', 'have', 'original', 'DVD', 'box', 'sets', 'seen', 'extras', 'already.The', 'picture', 'outstanding', 'what', 'old', '70ish', 'cartooning', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'ask', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'good', 'update', 'DVDs', 'have', 'not', 'bought', 'DVD', 'sets', 'would', 'definitely', 'pick', 'copy', 'show', 'up', 'best', 'ever', 'looked', 'not', 'significant', 'upgrade', 'DVD', 'sets', 'upgrade', 'blu-ray', 'have', 'done', 'like', 'show', 'hope', 'Gatchaman', 'II', 'be', 'released', 'buying', 'set', 'might', 'help', 'development', 'process', 'what', 'know', 'Disney', 'Eagle', 'Riders', 'was', 'American', 'adaptation', 'Gatchaman', 'II', 'who', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'released', 'unedited', 'format.Sound', 'English', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'Mono', 'good', 'again', 'not', 'significant', 'upgrade', 'DVDs', 'got', 'Japanese', 'tracks', 'as', 'well', 'subtitles', 'are', 'huge', 'fill', 'up', 'screen.Overall', 'best', 'show', 'ever', 'looked', 'opinion', 'upgrade', 'not', 'worth', 'already', 'own', 'DVD', 'sets', 'bought', 'really', 'show', 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'better', 'picture', 'sound', 'What', 'got', 'better', 'picture', 'upgraded', 'sound', 'not', 'huge', 'jump', 'original', 'DVDs', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'DVDs', 'want', 'get', 'Science', 'Ninja', 'Teams', 'set', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'DVDs', 'own', 'Blu-Ray', 'player', 'better', 'format', 'newcomer.Another', 'thing', 'note', 'worthy', 'release', 'OVA', 'episodes', 'remastered', 'dubbed', 'just', 'original', 'show', 'Episodes', '1-3', 'OVA', 'Original', 'Video', 'Animation', 'now', 'presented', 'unedited', 'redone', 'Which', 'blu-ray', 'little', 'more', 'attractive', 'upgrade', 'too', 'even', 'do', 'own', 'original', 'DVDs.Note', 'When', 'say', 'original', 'DVDs', 'am', 'talking', 'older', 'nine', 'DVD', 'sets', 'released', '2005', 'new', 'DVD', 'set', 'episodes', 'contain', 'OVA', 'episodes', 'now']",N/A
1660405,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B00DPH7S82,Stephen M. Lerch,"[38, 38]","I admit, I have not yet watched ALL of Gatchaman on Blu Ray. But I have completed 2 discs on Blu Ray, and spot checked others.The good news is, if you want Gatchaman with the best image quality available, this is the set to buy.The bad news is, if you hate Sentai's subtitle font on other releases (they are GIGANTIC because they use their old DVD subs I believe), that hasn't changed. The other bad news is the extras. What's wrong with the extras?1) Not all of the extras from the original DVD releases are included. Where is the translated Manga they had? Gone, that's where.2) 1080p. S T R E T C H E D from SD sources. Yes, they cropped this into a 16x9 format. Graphics look ugly, people look fat. Why did they do that here, in the extras, but left the original video intact? I'm not sure, maybe they assume no one cares about the extras like they would the series proper?If you can live with stretched extras, some of the original DVD extras missing, but want the best video quality possible, then this is the set for you.Gatchaman - Science Ninja Team Gatchaman is also known as Battle of the Planets or G-Force. This collection is the full, complete, uncut original Japanese version of the series. In case you weren't aware, BoP and G-Force were cut from this series to be created.Science Ninja Team Gatchaman is an Anime series from 1972 that ran through 1974 and comprises 105 episodes. Also included are the OVAs from the series, the 3 episode OVA.Video:High quality, but you have to remember the source. The video is a lot less grainy than the original DVDs, and there is no longer odd compression blocks appearing around dark lines (such as outlines on characters).1080p, in the original 4:3 aspect ratio, AVC encoded. There are some instances of dirt/scratches, but most of it looks like things where the damage is beneath cells and not easily repaired with digital magic.Audio:Japanese and English spoken language in lossless. The Japanese language track sounds a little muddy, but is no different than the original Japanese language track on the original DVDs. I believe this was actually a monoaural sourceThe English language track is much clearer and sounds pretty good.Extras:Almost all of the extras from the original DVD releases, the ones with the extras discs, are included. As stated above, they have some issues.Video is stretched from an SD source to look like an HD source. This means characters, logos and people all look a lot wider than they should be.Also missing are the Gatchaman Manga translations that were in the original DVD releases as video extras.There may be other extras missing and I'll update my review as I find them, but the interviews and so on ARE included.Overall:This is a very good set, with what I'd deem minor issues. Minor because they only affect the extras.if the extras are important to you, then track down the original DVD sets (some of the rarer sets can get... expensive). Also buy this set for the absolutely fantastic video, but keep the old sets for extras.",5,"Blu Rays, in hand and viewed",1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,3022,"['admit', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'watched', 'ALL', 'Gatchaman', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'have', 'completed', '2', 'discs', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'spot', 'checked', 'others.The', 'good', 'news', 'want', 'Gatchaman', 'best', 'image', 'quality', 'available', 'set', 'buy.The', 'bad', 'news', 'hate', 'Sentai', 'subtitle', 'font', 'other', 'releases', 'are', 'GIGANTIC', 'use', 'old', 'DVD', 'subs', 'believe', ""n't"", 'changed', 'other', 'bad', 'news', 'extras', 'What', 'wrong', 'extras', '1', 'Not', 'extras', 'original', 'DVD', 'releases', 'are', 'included', 'Where', 'translated', 'Manga', 'had', 'Gone', 'where.2', '1080p', 'S', 'T', 'R', 'E', 'T', 'C', 'H', 'E', 'D', 'SD', 'sources', 'Yes', 'cropped', '16x9', 'format', 'Graphics', 'look', 'ugly', 'people', 'look', 'fat', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'here', 'extras', 'left', 'original', 'video', 'intact', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'maybe', 'assume', 'one', 'extras', 'would', 'series', 'proper', 'can', 'live', 'stretched', 'extras', 'original', 'DVD', 'extras', 'missing', 'want', 'best', 'video', 'quality', 'possible', 'then', 'set', 'you.Gatchaman', 'Science', 'Ninja', 'Team', 'Gatchaman', 'also', 'known', 'Battle', 'Planets', 'G-Force', 'collection', 'full', 'complete', 'uncut', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'series', 'case', 'were', ""n't"", 'aware', 'BoP', 'G-Force', 'were', 'cut', 'series', 'be', 'created.Science', 'Ninja', 'Team', 'Gatchaman', 'Anime', 'series', '1972', 'ran', '1974', '105', 'episodes', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'OVAs', 'series', '3', 'episode', 'OVA.Video', 'High', 'quality', 'have', 'remember', 'source', 'video', 'lot', 'less', 'grainy', 'original', 'DVDs', 'longer', 'odd', 'compression', 'blocks', 'appearing', 'dark', 'lines', 'such', 'outlines', 'characters', '.1080p', 'original', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'AVC', 'encoded', 'are', 'instances', 'dirt/scratches', 'most', 'things', 'where', 'damage', 'beneath', 'cells', 'not', 'easily', 'repaired', 'digital', 'magic.Audio', 'Japanese', 'English', 'spoken', 'language', 'lossless', 'Japanese', 'language', 'track', 'little', 'muddy', 'different', 'original', 'Japanese', 'language', 'track', 'original', 'DVDs', 'believe', 'was', 'actually', 'monoaural', 'sourceThe', 'English', 'language', 'track', 'much', 'clearer', 'pretty', 'good.Extras', 'Almost', 'extras', 'original', 'DVD', 'releases', 'ones', 'extras', 'discs', 'are', 'included', 'stated', 'have', 'issues.Video', 'stretched', 'SD', 'source', 'look', 'HD', 'source', 'characters', 'logos', 'people', 'look', 'lot', 'wider', 'should', 'be.Also', 'missing', 'are', 'Gatchaman', 'Manga', 'translations', 'were', 'original', 'DVD', 'video', 'may', 'be', 'other', 'extras', 'missing', ""'ll"", 'update', 'review', 'find', 'interviews', 'so', 'ARE', 'included.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'set', 'what', ""'d"", 'deem', 'minor', 'issues', 'Minor', 'only', 'affect', 'extras.if', 'extras', 'are', 'important', 'then', 'track', 'down', 'original', 'DVD', 'sets', 'rarer', 'sets', 'can', 'get', 'expensive', 'Also', 'buy', 'set', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'video', 'keep', 'old', 'sets', 'extras']",N/A

I usually consider myself a purist and prefer to watch the show in its original Japanese language with the English subtitles, but the newly created English language track is fantastic and the voices appropriately match the characters spot on (not the English dub crap that was in Battle of the Planets).Both Japanese and English tracks are included here with optional English subtitles. For sound quality, the Japanese track seems to sound weak and loses depth, whereas the English track sounds full and rich. For this reason, I watch Gatchaman in English.The video quality is superb! Many of the scenes look as if it was produced yesterday. This is the best we're going to see it.As for the extras, I haven't looked into this yet, but read many reviews on it which gives me a good idea what to expect.THIS SHOW IS ADDICTING! I can't seem to stop watching it!",5,Absolutely Addicting!
