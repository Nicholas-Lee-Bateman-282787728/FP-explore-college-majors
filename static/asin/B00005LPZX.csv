I am a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, and while I've never ranted at the Academy for overlooking him at Oscar time, I have on enough occassions enjoyed Dolph Lungren that I thought we had a chance here. Ninety minutes later, I was ready to go find someone to give me a hug and make me forget having ever seen it. This film fails in every possible way, and action film with no action, a post-apocalyptic with only passing reference to peril and no cool costuming eye candy, a war story with no discernable plot or point, a romance with all the chemistry of a stale pop-tart. This film couldn't even manage to be offensive. I'm sure everyone shares blame in it, the writers, the actors, the director. For goodness sake, if you have some critical need to see this, be it Dolph Lungren fan or masochism, wait for a tv broadcast.

664347,AE8YLQ8P45GR,B00005LPZX,M.C,"[8, 10]","I've seen several of Doplh Lundgren's films. SHOWDOWN IN LITTLE TOKYO had to have been one of his best, and he excelled as the cop who I nicknamed ""SGT. SAMURAI"". I also liked some of his other films like SWEEPERS, and Lundgren made a great bad guy in UNIVERSAL SOLDIER.These days, he's suffered the fate of so many karate stars out there to be condemned to only direct-to-video films. He may never be in another theatrical fim again, but that doesn't mean he can't still make good films. I rented this and popped it into the DVD player, having read reviews of it on .... There, it was classified as an action;martial arts;science fiction hybrid, and that appealed to me. I rented WARRIOR hoping to see some of Lundgren's kung fu on display in an exciting action film.And that's the problem. This movie has much less action than Lundgren fans and Lundgren himself deserve. Oh, what little action there is in this flick is pretty well staged and has Lundgren showing off his martial arts prowess, and earns this film 2 stars in my book. The story is pretty clever to. An earthquake separating California from the mainland U.S., and it is then overrun by inmates of the maximum securiy prison.That sounds like the perfect setup for an action film, doesn't it? Of course. So why didn't the filmmakers get it right. Didn't they know that action films THAT HAVE ACTION are popular for a reason? Apparantly not. This is the kind of action film that was made in the days when guys like Davey Crockett were popular. Thank God we've gotten past that.Lundgren's career seems to be at a crossroads now, not so much because he's stuck doing direct-to-video, but because he did this movie. I have no doubt that his other films and his next film will better more enjoyable than this, but if he does continue to make this kind of action film, where the action is running on empty, he may be demoted further from direct-to-video to released-on-video-after-sitting-on-the-studio-shelf-for-three-years.",2,Action-less action movie,1055894400,"06 18, 2003",2003,1984,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'Doplh', 'Lundgren', 'films', 'SHOWDOWN', 'IN', 'LITTLE', 'TOKYO', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'best', 'excelled', 'cop', 'who', 'nicknamed', 'SGT', 'SAMURAI', 'also', 'liked', 'other', 'films', 'SWEEPERS', 'Lundgren', 'made', 'great', 'bad', 'guy', 'UNIVERSAL', 'SOLDIER.These', 'days', 'suffered', 'fate', 'so', 'many', 'karate', 'stars', 'there', 'be', 'condemned', 'only', 'direct-to-video', 'films', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'theatrical', 'fim', 'again', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'still', 'make', 'good', 'films', 'rented', 'popped', 'DVD', 'player', 'having', 'read', 'reviews', 'was', 'classified', 'action', 'martial', 'arts', 'science', 'fiction', 'hybrid', 'appealed', 'rented', 'WARRIOR', 'hoping', 'see', 'Lundgren', 'kung', 'fu', 'display', 'exciting', 'action', 'film.And', 'problem', 'movie', 'much', 'less', 'action', 'Lundgren', 'fans', 'Lundgren', 'deserve', 'Oh', 'what', 'little', 'action', 'flick', 'pretty', 'well', 'staged', 'Lundgren', 'showing', 'off', 'martial', 'arts', 'prowess', 'film', '2', 'stars', 'book', 'story', 'pretty', 'clever', 'earthquake', 'separating', 'California', 'mainland', 'U.S.', 'then', 'overrun', 'inmates', 'maximum', 'securiy', 'prison.That', 'perfect', 'setup', 'action', 'film', ""n't"", 'course', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'filmmakers', 'get', 'right', 'Did', ""n't"", 'know', 'action', 'films', 'HAVE', 'ACTION', 'are', 'popular', 'reason', 'Apparantly', 'not', 'kind', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'days', 'when', 'guys', 'Davey', 'Crockett', 'were', 'popular', 'Thank', 'God', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'past', 'that.Lundgren', 'career', 'be', 'crossroads', 'now', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'stuck', 'doing', 'direct-to-video', 'did', 'movie', 'have', 'doubt', 'other', 'films', 'next', 'film', 'will', 'better', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'continue', 'make', 'kind', 'action', 'film', 'where', 'action', 'running', 'empty', 'may', 'be', 'demoted', 'further', 'direct-to-video', 'released-on-video-after-sitting-on-the-studio-shelf-for-three-years']",The Last Warrior
664348,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00005LPZX,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","For some reason, I've been very eager to see this movie for a while. Now that I've watched it, I think I could've held off for another few years. Rumor has it that this one's production wasn't an easy one, and the lackluster quality of the finished product seems to confirm this. Plainly, this is an overwritten action movie without a lot of action. It doesn't look as cheap as it most likely was to make, but it's still a low point in the careers of star Dolph Lundgren and director Sheldon Lettich (Only the Strong).The story: after a massive earthquake has torn California apart, an amnesiac military captain (Lundgren) leads a gang of survivors against the hardships of their barren surroundings.Note that my plot summary doesn't mention any specific villain or antagonism that Dolph & co. must overcome - that's because they don't really need to, at least until the movie's last half-hour. There's a bad guy who leads a dismantled prison (played by the late Juliano Mer-Khamis,Deadly Heroes) and its inmates, but even though he's introduced early on, he doesn't become a threat until the last third of the movie when he kidnaps the resident ditz of Dolph's camp (Rebecca Cross,The Bachelor). Up until then, Dolph spends his time dealing with a strange infection that causes peoples' skin to boil, finding new members to add to his camp, and getting nagged at by the thoroughly annoying Sherri Alexander (Layover). Trust me when I say that there isn't much of interest going on here. Of course, if there actually were a story worth following for most of the film, it'd be competing for prominence with Dolph's endless exposition monologues and the oversaturated cast, which includes no shortage of misfit characters whose names you won't even bother to remember and whose importance to the film is completely facetious in several cases.A bit of action might have alleviated some of the boredom I endured while watching the film, but again, there's very little here that's actually worth watching. In the movie's first hour, the action highlight is a scene wherein the characters chase a horse. There's almost nothing between then and the next hour, after which Dolph and a few others infiltrate the prison and there's a bit of punching, shooting, and an explosion or two - again, nothing worth noting.Another reviewer has commented that this might have been a pilot for a promising TV series, and because of the soundness of the movie's production values, I almost agree - this would have at least presented an opportunity to flesh out the characters a bit more. However, the fact that Lundgren - in the only instance in living memory - had his voice dubbed by another actor for stretches at a time seems to indicate that his attachment to this project was limited, and I doubt he would have wanted to do much more of ""The Last Warrior"" (then again, he needn't have been in a big hurry to do the subsequentAgent Redin my opinion). I really can't recommend this to anyone but completionists.",2,"""We're gonna have something different tonight if I have to barf it up and call it casserole!""",1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,2994,"['reason', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'eager', 'see', 'movie', 'while', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'held', 'off', 'few', 'years', 'Rumor', 'one', 'production', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'one', 'lackluster', 'quality', 'finished', 'product', 'confirm', 'Plainly', 'overwritten', 'action', 'movie', 'lot', 'action', ""n't"", 'look', 'as', 'cheap', 'most', 'likely', 'was', 'make', 'still', 'low', 'point', 'careers', 'star', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'director', 'Sheldon', 'Lettich', 'Only', 'Strong', '.The', 'story', 'massive', 'earthquake', 'torn', 'California', 'apart', 'amnesiac', 'military', 'captain', 'Lundgren', 'gang', 'survivors', 'hardships', 'barren', 'surroundings.Note', 'plot', 'summary', ""n't"", 'mention', 'specific', 'villain', 'antagonism', 'Dolph', 'co.', 'must', 'overcome', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'least', 'movie', 'last', 'half-hour', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'dismantled', 'prison', 'played', 'late', 'Juliano', 'Mer-Khamis', 'Deadly', 'Heroes', 'inmates', 'even', 'introduced', 'early', ""n't"", 'become', 'threat', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'when', 'resident', 'ditz', 'Dolph', 'camp', 'Rebecca', 'Cross', 'Bachelor', 'then', 'Dolph', 'time', 'dealing', 'strange', 'infection', 'peoples', 'skin', 'boil', 'finding', 'new', 'members', 'add', 'camp', 'getting', 'nagged', 'thoroughly', 'annoying', 'Sherri', 'Alexander', 'Layover', 'Trust', 'when', 'say', ""n't"", 'much', 'interest', 'going', 'here', 'course', 'actually', 'were', 'story', 'worth', 'following', 'most', 'film', ""'d"", 'be', 'competing', 'prominence', 'Dolph', 'endless', 'exposition', 'monologues', 'oversaturated', 'cast', 'shortage', 'misfit', 'characters', 'names', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'remember', 'importance', 'film', 'completely', 'facetious', 'several', 'cases.A', 'bit', 'action', 'might', 'have', 'alleviated', 'boredom', 'endured', 'watching', 'film', 'again', 'very', 'little', 'here', 'actually', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'first', 'hour', 'action', 'highlight', 'scene', 'characters', 'chase', 'horse', 'almost', 'nothing', 'then', 'next', 'hour', 'Dolph', 'few', 'others', 'infiltrate', 'prison', 'bit', 'punching', 'shooting', 'explosion', 'two', 'again', 'nothing', 'worth', 'noting.Another', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'pilot', 'promising', 'TV', 'series', 'soundness', 'movie', 'production', 'values', 'almost', 'agree', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'presented', 'opportunity', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'bit', 'more', 'However', 'fact', 'Lundgren', 'only', 'instance', 'living', 'memory', 'had', 'voice', 'dubbed', 'actor', 'stretches', 'time', 'indicate', 'attachment', 'project', 'was', 'limited', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'Last', 'Warrior', 'then', 'again', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'big', 'hurry', 'do', 'subsequentAgent', 'Redin', 'opinion', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'completionists']",The Last Warrior
