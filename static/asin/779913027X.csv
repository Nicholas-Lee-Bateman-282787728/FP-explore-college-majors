I was SO completely wrong.I really, really regret not taking my family to see this in the theater. This is a lush, beautiful film- the entire time I watched it, I was breathless from it's beauty and just the sheer simple pleasure of watching it.The story is simple- Arrietty is a ""borrower""- she and her mom and dad live in the floorboards of a country house, and in order to sustain their life, they ""borrow"" things from the humans who live above them. They only take what they need and what won't be missed, and do so in complete secret because once they are seen by human eyes, they are in extreme danger and must immediately find a new place to live. And since a few feet to a human is miles for a ""borrower"", it's of the utmost importance that their existence and activities NOT be discovered.As you can guess, Arrietty is discovered, by young Shawn. Shawn is the nephew of the human woman who owns the country house, and is there to prepare and rest up for dangerous heart surgery. He's unusually kind and sensitive, and his gentle nature convinces a reluctant Arrietty to trust him.Of course, nothing is simple- Shawn isn't the only one who knows about Arrietty and her family.Regardless, this is a QUIET film. It's just beautifully compelling. The animation is SO beautiful and impressionistic. I felt a deep sense of peace and awe as we watched, but the plot was still exciting enough that I was stuck in my seat, watching every bit of action.I can't recommend this film enough, whether you have kids or not. I have reluctantly become a fan of kids movies since we have a six year old daughter and we LOVE going to the movies, and Arrietty makes me *so* grateful that I have been introduced to this whole new world of cinema.

But note that Miyazaki did write the screenplay, though he did not direct the film.Arrietty tells the story that we might all be familiar with: the Borrowers I think it was called in my youth.  But it's a touching tale with a richly told story.  My only problem is that the story feels like it came right from the book.  Previous Ghibli films (written by Miyazaki) had a huge brush of originality, despite most being based on existing novels or works.  Still it is a great film, imaginative, and brought to life wonderfully.The background animations are excellent, and are among some of the best I have seen.  The character animation is in typical studio Ghibli style: simple designs and very ordinary looking people.  The only exception to the ordinary look seems to be the villains in the films (the old maid in this film or Jigo in Mononoke or Yubaba in Spirited Away).The story was overall a happy one, despite some tension.  It is suitable for all ages, and even adults like myself can enjoy it.The only reason I gave it four stars is because I have a high yardstick I use to measure Ghibli's films.  When you produce masterpieces like Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, and Nausicaa it's truly hard to match the level of these.

You could plop the kids down in front of the blu-ray player, start the film, walk away, and not be concerned that the kids will be exposed to violence, vulgar or sex so common to movies today.

It was directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi and produced by Studio Ghibli. After a successful run in Japan, and winning the Animation of the Year Award at the 34 Japan Academy Price, it was released in the Untied States by Walt Disney Pictures in early 2012. Disney's release had an American dub with the voices of Bridgit Mendler, David Henrie, Will Arnett, Amy Poehler and Carol Burnett.A boy named Shawn is sent to live with his great aunt Jessica's, the same house his mother had grew up in. Shawn's parents are busy with work and don't have the time to take care him. He is going to have  heart in a few weeks and needs to rest. His mother told him about the little people who live in the walls, of course Shawn thinks it was just a story, but he was wrong.Shawn awakens one night to see two borrowers, Arrietty and her father, Pod. Scared at the Shawn seeing them, they run away and the sugar cube (which they borrowed) falls out of her bag. The next day Shawn leaves the cube and a note near an underground air vent. She tells her parents, whom tells her to not to touch it. Eventually, she decides to return the cube to Shawn. After an incident with a crow, Shawn and Arrietty become friends.The maid named Haru discovers that there are borrowers among them and decides to capture one of them, Arrietty's mother, Homily. Then Shawn and Arrietty come up with a plan to save her.I grew up on The Littles television series based on the book by John Peterson, which was inspired by The Borrowers. After seeing The Secret World of Arreitty advertise on the Disney Channel, I planned on buying it when it came out on DVD. I don't watch a lot of Japanese animation, but I liked the style of this film. From the colors to the sound, I felt like I was in a borrower's world. There are some differences between the movie and the original book, but it didn't disrupt me from loving it.

Overall, the movie did a good job at putting forth the main tenets of the way in which the borrowers live. I was excited to share this story with my own girls as well. In watching this, I have to say that first the movie has a great plot that brings together a great story of friendship and as well as growing up and learning the real truths that may have alluded the characters in the past. While the ending may not be what I would have expected (but should have), it was still a very good movie and the girls loved it.

486903,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,779913027X,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","In 2010, Studio Ghibli (the popular anime studio known for creating ""Ponyo"", ""Spirited Away"", ""Princess Mononoke"", ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"", ""Castle in the Sky"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" to name few) released the film ""The Secret World of Arriety"", a film adaptation of the popular children's fantasy novel ""The Borrowers"" (1952) by English author Mary Norton.The film broke records in Japan, surpassing it's previous film ""Ponyo"", opening on 1,522 theaters (a record for a Studio Ghibli film) and earn over $145 million in the box office.  The film is the 4th biggest earning anime film in Japan of all time and won ""Animation of the Year"" in 2011 at the 34th Japan Academy Prize.""The Secret of Arriety"" is a Studio Ghibli film directed by Hiromasa Yonebashi (""Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade"", ""Ponyo"", ""Spirited Away"", ""Spriggan"") and a screenplay by Hayao Miyazaki (""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"", ""Castle in the Sky"", ""Howl's Moving Castle"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"" to name a few) and Keiko Niwa (""Tales from the Earthsea"", ""Ocean Waves"", ""From Up on Poppy Hill"").The US release would feature music and vocals by French singer and harper Cecile Corbel and would feature the voices of Disney Channel actress Bridgit Mendler (""Good Luck Charlie"", ""Lemonade Mouth""), Amy Poehler (""Parks and Recreation"", ""Saturday Night Live""), Will Arnett (""30 Rock"", ""Arrested Development""), Carol Burnett (""The Carol Burnett Show""), David Henrie (""Wizards of Waverly Place"", ""How I Met Your Mother"") and Moises Arias (""Hannah Montana"", ""Astro Boy"").VIDEO:Magical, beautiful and everything that you can expect from Studio Ghibli. I was completely in awe when I watched ""The Secret World of Arrietty"".  The painted backgrounds are so detailed, so beautiful to look at and of course, that Studio Ghibli style of character design.In this day and age, we tend to put so much into CG animated films and whenever I watch a Studio Ghibli fan, I always find it amazing of how gorgeous their films are.  From the first animated film that I watched back in the early '90s (which was ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"") to the latest release of ""The Secret World of Arrietty"", Studio Ghibli continues to show this creative style through this film. The hand painted backgrounds are absolutely beautiful, the character design continues that Studio Ghibli look and style that they are famous for and I was hypnotized, captivated and loving every minute of the film.Presented in 1080p High Definition, detail can be seen on the painted backgrounds. Vibrant during the day scenes, amazingly detailed to the little kitchenware used by the Borrowers, its one thing I expected from Studio Ghibli and nothing less and once again, they have delivered.There are no compression artifacts, edge enhancement, aliasing, banding or any problems in picture quality for ""The Secret World of Arietty"" whatsoever. This film looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Secret of World of Arrietty"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and in Japanese and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.First the good. As one can expect from the Japanese casting, the voice acting is fantastic and the English dub track is equally magnificent.And you want an immersive soundscape? ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" delivers. From the ambiance of the home on top of the hills with nothing but nature, you can hear the birds chirping, the insects, Nina the cat growling, the breeze flowing through their, great use of directional sound.  Indoors, the same thing as the Borrowers, Arrietty and her father can hear the ticking of the clocks, the scurrying of the rats and its absolutely immersive.While this film is not the type to use LFE, there are some moments that do use a bit of lower frequency sounds but for this animated film, dialogue and music is crystal clear and great use of the surround channels for ambiance.The other positive is unlike ""Ponyo"" which Disney didn't give the Japanese soundtrack a lossless audio soundtrack, with ""The Secret World of Arrietty"", a Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is included.As for the bad, there isn't any.  Aside it not having as many action sequences compared to ""Nausicaa"", ""Spirited Away"" and ""Ponyo"", this is not one of those type of films.  But still, ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" sounds wonderful and fans should be pleased with the lossless soundtracks!Subtitles are in English ESL, SDH and in French.SPECIAL FEATURES:If there was only one downer of this Blu-ray release, it is that""The Secret World of Arrietty"" has very little special features.  Included are:Original Japanese Storyboards - Watch the entire film but this time with the video showcasing the original storyboards.Cecile Corbel's ""Arrietty's Song"" Music Video - The Japanese version of Cecile Corbel's ""Arriety's Song""Bridgit Mendler's ""Summertime"" Music Video - (3:01) Bridgit Mendler, voice actress of Arrietty in the US version, sings the film's ending theme.The Making of ""Summertime"" - (2:02) The making of Bridgit Mendler's music video.Trailers & TV Spots - The Japanese trailers and TV spots.EXTRAS:A DVD of ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" is included with this Blu-ray release. The DVD is in Widescreen (1:85:1) - Enhanced for 169 Televisions, English and French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, with subtitles in English ESL, SDH and French.  A slipcover is included.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Secret World of Arrietty"" is an enjoyable, delightful and non-complex film that is visually captivating and looks and sounds fantastic on Blu-ray!While one of the things that people will notice is that the film has the Studio Ghibli quality in look and also in character interaction, this is a Hiromasa Yonebashi directed film and a film written by Hayao Miyazaki and Keiko Niwa.  It's a film that is not complex, not about the environment, nor is it polemic film that is driving to drive a message to the viewer.  And is more accessible for younger viewers, compared to the more serious Studio Ghibli films such as ""Spirited Away"", ""Princess Mononoke"", ""Grave of the Fireflies"" or even ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"".But ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" is lighthearted and is pretty much on scale with other Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki films such as ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Whispers of the Heart"".  Captivating and enjoyable films that is not entirely geared towards older viewers, a film that I can enjoy with my young son and other parents can watch with their families.  It's essentially a family film and in some way, as a fan of Studio Ghibli films, I love the fact that the studio tends to change things up once in awhile.I can understand if some people who prefer Studio Ghibli's more epic storylines with a deeper message and I'm sure Studio Ghibli will continue to make those movies as they do with these lighthearted films, but with ""The Secret World of Arrietty"", this is a film that I enjoyed because it's touching, heartwarming and just overall delightful and no worries of complexity, it's straight-forward and even my 9-year-old loved it!And the Blu-ray is magnificent!  But not perfect.  Video and audio quality is fantastic, although this is not one of those action-intense films, the film makes up with its visual flair and ambiance.  The main low-point of this Blu-ray release is that there are not as many special features included.Fortunately, this Blu-ray release comes with a DVD, so as summer vacation is around the corner, parents can use the DVD for those long commutes or something the children can watch during the summertime.Overall, I was captivated by the beauty of ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" and also found the story to delightful, lighthearted and enjoyable.  A more accessible, non-complex family film that once again, Studio Ghibli delivers!",4,"(Blu-ray) Delightful, lighthearted and a film worth watching!",1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,7842,"['2010',

The artistic textures and details, particularly in his exterior shots, in the natural world, are nothing short of stunning. This script is one of his more accessible, mainstream works, with little of the eerie, double-edged supernatural elements that make his earlier films so ambiguous and perplexing. However, he still offers a view of a magical, wondrous world that is a welcome contrast to American films in which magic and fantasy are more like commodities than actual mysteries - the Ghibli Studios films have a unique feel and tone that radiate from this wonderful film. Appropriate for a variety of ages, including smaller children -- a slower-paced, enchanting film with captivating drama and a real sense of wonder. Highly recommended!

486907,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,779913027X,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","The artwork is lush; it&#8217;s a magnificent looking film.  The story, on the other hand, is a bit sparse and under developed.

486908,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,779913027X,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[31, 39]","Studio Ghibli needs no introduction. They took us to the heavens in ""Castle in the Sky"", sent us into a realm of demons with ""Spirited Away"", and plunged us into a desperate struggle for protecting the forest in ""Princess Mononoke."" Arguably, no other anime studio knows how to nail complete immersion into a world, except for places such as Kyoto Animation and Madhouse. When it comes to making us believe every second of a story, Ghibli knows how to hit the sweet spot. With it's only misfire, the absolutely dreadful ""Tales of Earthsea"", etched into North American audience's memories more recently than 2009's excellent ""Ponyo"", there was some speculation at whether or not this would be the venerable studio's chance at redemption. Simply put: it is.""The Secret of Arriety"" is a wonderful film, up there with classics such as ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Spirited Away."" Based on the timeless children's story, ""The Borrowers"", it follows Arriety and her family, who are all Borrowers living inside the house of a disgruntled old woman. A Borrower is a sort of pocket human, a tiny person who goes around and takes things from humans that they wouldn't miss. Examples include a cube of sugar, or a single snack cracker. To the Borrowers, these things are massive hauls that will last them weeks. But their existence is threatened once the old woman who lives the house, Haru, discovers their presence and begins the first of many attempts to entrap them. It's only with the aid of kindly Sho, the woman's sick nephew who lives in the house, do they stand a chance at surviving.It's instantly clear that, compared to much larger struggles seen in other Ghibli films, this conflict is relatively small-scale. Instead of focusing on an epic struggle between the Borrowers and Haru, ""Arriety"" simply comes across as a lighthearted cat-and-mouse game between the two parties, with Shaun serving as the mediator between the whole affair. Which isn't to say that's necessarily a bad thing. The last time Ghibli went big, we got ""Earthsea"", and I applaud them for being able to rein in this film into a tighter, more focused narrative. While there are deeper moments that shine through, such as Arriety's fear for the survival of her race, it's a very light affair compared to their other films, but it works overall.There are a few components of the film, however, that feel particularly weak. My primary issue is with the character of Spiller, an uncivilized Borrower who lives off of the land and carries a bow and arrow. His role is very scant, and seems to only be there to give Arriety a love interest. Which doesn't really work, considering that he's probably only in the film for a combined time of five minutes. He comes across as forced, as if Miyazaki (who wrote, but not directed, this film) said, ""Oh, darn, there needs to be a Borrower boy for Arriety to crush on!"", and inserted him into the film. While he does serve as an interesting key into the larger world of surviving Borrowers, his purpose as even that feels a bit unnecessary.It's hard to fault a single character for a problem that is prevalent throughout the screenplay, however, and thus this brings me to my only gripe about the movie: it's not fleshed out enough. Every aspect of the world, whether it be Sho's sickness, Arriety's history, or Haru's seemingly conniving nature, is never fully explained. Why did Sho's parents divorce? Why would his mother not be with him in his time of need? Why does Arriety's family have to leave once they're seen? Who came up with the established code that all Borrower's apparently live by? These and other questions are never really answered, nor is a key moment of the film where Sho conveniently knows where Haru has entrapped Arriety's mother, despite never finding any clue whatsoever to her place of captivity. This is not Ghibli's deepest work, by any means, nor is it trying to be. However, I do feel an extra 20 minutes of running time might have benefited this film to provide more back story.This is more of a snapshot type of movie, one that captures a certain moment in time and fills every detail of that moment with rich and fulfilling description. In place of this description is top-notch animation from Ghibli, on par with their fantastic work in ""Ponyo."" The true scale of the real world through the eyes of the Borrowers is one of the strongest suits of ""Arriety."" Kitchens become mountains, and meadows become forests. In order to fill their tiny cups with a beverage, they drip in a single drop, which fills them to the brim. They mash crackers into wheat, and use postage stamps as ornamental paintings. Every aspect of this film's artistic vision is fully realized, and that alone makes up for the somewhat lacking plot. It's rare that a film possesses a convincing enough world that will let you drift away in it for a while, but ""Arriety"" has it down.Another aid to making this world believable is the voice acting, which is some of the best I've ever seen in a Disney localization of a Ghibli film. Bridgit Mendler, who hails from the Disney Channel stable of young actors, is completely convincing as Arriety, giving her a childish sense of whimsy coupled with believable pathos and fears for her own kind's existence. Amy Poehler and Will Arnett, respectively playing Arriety's mother and father, are splendid as well. Poehler plays the role of Homily with the panicked urgency of the one of the worse worriers imaginable, while Arnett turns Pod into a gruff man with a dull voice and a consistent sense of seriousness. Both of these approaches are fantastic, making them two of the film's most memorable characters. However, my personal favorite voice had to be Haru's, who is voiced by the legendary Carol Burnett. She seems to be having the most fun out of all the actors, milking the aunt's every little tick and vocal outburst to create a character who is one nudge away from going truly and utterly insane. Even her smaller moments are hysterical, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a current celebrity who puts this much effort into making voice work come across as zany and enjoyable. However, other characters such as Sho and Spiller are a bit bland, especially the former, whose performance sounds chronically tired and bored. Disney should have reached outside of it's Disney Channel stable for these two roles, because they're certainly the weakest in the film.Every complaint I have about Arriety, though, is far outweighed by the sheer elation I felt while watching it. It certainly doesn't reach the level of my personal favorite Ghibli work, ""Castle in the Sky"", but it's not necessarily trying to outdo any previous films. Instead, it take the simpler route of storytelling, focusing on a fully realized world and the bond between Sho and Arriety which is built throughout the movie. It's Miyazaki at his most accessible, and also at his most sincere and heartfelt. There's an air of sweetness and innocence that permeates through the whole experience, one that anybody watching it immediately catches wind of. By the ending credits, you will care about Arriety and Sho, even if they aren't the deepest characters in the world. You will feel something tugging at your heartstrings, a feeling of warmth that no other movie could give of. It is because of this feeling, coupled with the excellent scenery, music and voice acting, that I say that ""The Secret World of Arriety"" is more than worth seeing. Rarely does a movie leave you feeling completely fulfilled and happy, but this is one of those movies. Don't pass up the chance to be happy.Plot: BAnimation: A+Voice Acting (EN): A-Music: A+Overall: B+",4,Size Doesn't Matter,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,7664,"['Studio', 'Ghibli', 'introduction',

486911,A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,779913027X,Feelah the tigress,"[2, 2]","I'm a longtime fan of Studio Ghibli releases, and I've seen every film of theirs that was available to me (that means I missed out on the ones that weren't released in the U.S.).  Unlike many previous Studio Ghibli efforts, this film was directed by first-time director Hiromasa Yonebayashi (apparently Mr. Miyazaki still wrote it though).  My impression of him as a director is that he did a fine job.  I wouldn't say that this film is my favorite Studio Ghibli release,  but it's certainly a worthwhile one.  Now, on to the real review (oh, and there will be big plot spoilers - consider yourself warned).The story is based on the age old over-adapted book, The Borrowers.  Before anyone asks, yes, I've seen the live-action film.  Basically, this movie will seem very familiar to anyone who's already seen the other movie or read the book.  Although Studio Ghibli is known for making adaptations that barely follow the source material, here they stick pretty close to the standard story.  The protagonist Arrietty is a tiny person who steals things for a living (called a Borrower) who lives in the house of Shawn's aunt.  Shawn has moved there temporarily to rest up for his big heart surgery and while there he discovers Arrietty and befriends her.  The pacing of the story is slow and deliberate, which is a welcome relief from many other films that careen forward at breakneck speed.  The film really gives the characters time to warm up to each other in a gradual and believable fashion.  During the course of the film, you get a feeling that Shawn is lonely because he is sick (can't travel around a lot to make any friends) and he is the only person his age in the house.  Arrietty, too, seems lonely as she is the only borrower other than her parents that live in the area (until they meet Spiller later).  The friendship between Arrietty and Shawn has a particular sense of poignancy and yearning to it because of they both clearly desperately want a friend and yet their differences are driving them apart.  Indeed, Arrietty's parents decide that now that the ""beans"" know they are there, it's too dangerous and they must move away...  It's overall a very lovely story that's simple, yet heartwarming, and Studio Ghibli is one of the few that can pull off a film with pacing this slow yet still keep it interesting.  I do have a complaint, though: Disney apparently decided that the original ending was too ambiguous and added a few sentences of narration by Shawn at the end to indicate that he survived his heart surgery and that Arrietty and her family made it safely to their new home.  I really felt like this hurt the poignant feeling of the film and that it was better left open-ended.Alright, now as for the visuals, they are lovely.  The best thing in this film's favor visually as compared to the live action versions is that the animation really helps convey a sense of scale from the perspective of the little people.  I especially liked the imaginative uses for everyday household items (like the staples in the walls being used as handholds for a ladder).  The film also did a good job conveying just how dangerous and frightening everyday things are to someone that size (there is one point where Arrietty is chased by crickets!).  As for the regular people, anyone who's seen a Studio Ghibli film in their life will instantly recognize the art style.  Oh, and even though this doesn't really have anything to do with anything, I love the fact that the fat cat looks like Muta from The Cat Returns!Lastly, I should talk about the music and voice acting.  Strangely, out of all the Studio Ghibli films, I think I noticed the music the most in this film.  It was absolutely beautiful and really caught my attention.  The only part of the music I didn't care for was the song at the very end of the credits that sounded rather like bland Disney pop (and it pretty much is).  It's really too bad, because the earlier portion of the credits has a different song by Cecile Corbel called ""Arrietty's Song"" which is quite beautiful, but they chose to put the bland pop song's music video in the special features instead of focusing on that one.  Go figure.  As for the voice acting, I liked just about all of them.  I think I liked Shawn's voice the most, as everything he says is very quiet and subtle, making his character seem more mature for his age.  The only voice I didn't really care for much was Arrietty's father's voice, which just seemed a bit too deep and gruff (but if you liked it, to each their own!).  Everyone else's voices seemed fine to me.  I only wish (once again) that Disney hadn't added in the extra lines at the end proving that Shawn lives through the surgery...Well, if you've stuck with the review this far you can clearly see that even though it wasn't a 100% perfect film for me, I still thought it was very good.  If you are a fan of Studio Ghibli, definitely at least rent this movie.  If you are not familiar with Studio Ghibli and want to see what all the fuss is about, then this is a worthy film, but you might want to start with one of their more famous films (such as My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, or Howl's Moving Castle).  Either way though, if you're in the mood for a slower, more relaxing film, then The Secret World of Arrietty is a good choice.P.S. - I'm sad to say that although many other releases of Studio Ghibli films had lovely extra features, this one is sadly lacking.  The only special feature I've found is a music video for that ""Summertime"" song that plays during the credits (sadly my least favorite song from the film) and a making-of featurette for that music video.  There's no nifty interviews with the voice actors or the director or anything.  Also, I bought the Bluray/DVD version of this movie just in case the blu-ray version has better special features on it or something (you know, because blu-rays can hold more material than DVDs), but that's not the case.  It's exactly the same, so if you were hoping extra special features there, well, no such luck.

I can honestly state that I think the Studio Ghibli studio is the second best animated studio in the world (I am biased in this regard since Pixar has one of my favorite films of all time, Wall-E). I can tell a Miyazaki film from a Takahata film and respect the studio for its mission to both entertain and to feed the soul.In the latest Studio Ghibli film, I didn't bother with the English audio track. I listned to the Japanese audio and read the English subtitles. The film itself tells the story of Arrietty, a Borrower. What is a borrower you may ask? It is a Little Person. Think Tom Thumb or Thumbelina or the Littles. They live in their own world, but occasionally they must go into our world to borrow things - sugar, napkins, etc. But one day Arrietty is seen by the new boy, Sh&#333;, who just moved to the house while he tries to get well. Now the entire family of Arrietty is put into danger. Why? Because apparently when a Borrower is seen they have to move. It's never really explained why they have to move when they are seen but it is probably something to do with safety. This is one of the weaknesses of the film. It's never explored what would happen to the Borrowers if they stayed.The story of Arrietty doesn't quite have the same Studio Ghibli magic of some of the other films. This is not Totoro, though there have been comparisons. Nor does it really give you a window into the Japanese psyche like some of the others do. This is no Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke. Still, it is beautifully rendered and has some charm. Just not enough to make me want to watch it again. Now My Neighbor Totoro or Whisper of the Heart I could watch over and over. I was ultimately a little bit bored by the film. That doesn't make it bad. And it is a little bit unfair to it since I am actively comparing it to other Studio Ghibli films. But no film stands alone. And Studio Ghibli's quality is so high that when something is not quite as good as the other films, it stands out. Ah well. Yonebayashi was the director of the film and it is his first for Studio Ghibl. I hope that in time he finds his voice and begins to think about his films having multiple levels so that they can be enjoyed on more than one level.",3,The Borrowers: Japanese Style.,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,2314,"['now', 'have', 'watched', 'single', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'film', 'save', 'From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'can', 'honestly', 'state', 'think', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'studio', 'second', 'best', 'animated', 'studio', 'world', 'am', 'biased', 'regard', 'Pixar', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'Wall-E', 'can', 'tell', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'Takahata', 'film', 'respect', 'studio', 'mission', 'entertain', 'feed', 'soul.In', 'latest', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'English', 'audio', 'track', 'listned', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'read', 'English', 'subtitles', 'film', 'story', 'Arrietty', 'Borrower', 'What', 'borrower', 'may', 'ask', 'Little', 'Person', 'Think', 'Tom', 'Thumb', 'Thumbelina', 'Littles', 'live', 'own', 'world', 'occasionally', 'must', 'go', 'world', 'borrow', 'things', 'sugar', 'napkins', 'etc', 'one', 'day', 'Arrietty', 'seen', 'new', 'boy', 'Sh', '333', 'who', 'just', 'moved', 'house', 'get', 'well', 'Now', 'entire', 'family', 'Arrietty', 'put', 'danger', 'Why', 'apparently', 'when', 'Borrower', 'seen', 'have', 'move', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'why', 'have', 'move', 'when', 'are', 'seen', 'probably', 'something', 'do', 'safety', 'one', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'never', 'explored', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Borrowers', 'stayed.The', 'story', 'Arrietty', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'same', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'magic', 'other', 'films', 'not', 'Totoro', 'have', 'been', 'comparisons', 'really', 'give', 'window', 'Japanese', 'psyche', 'others', 'do', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Still', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'charm', 'Just', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'Now', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'could', 'watch', 'was', 'ultimately', 'little', 'bit', 'bored', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'little', 'bit', 'unfair', 'am', 'actively', 'comparing', 'other', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'films', 'film', 'alone', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'quality', 'so', 'high', 'when', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'films', 'out', 'Ah', 'well', 'Yonebayashi', 'was', 'director', 'film', 'first', 'Studio', 'Ghibl', 'hope', 'time', 'voice', 'think', 'films', 'having', 'multiple', 'levels', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'one', 'level']",The Secret World of Arrietty (Mandarin Chinese Edition)

486919,A2HVL790PBWYTU,779913027X,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","I dunno, maybe if legendary animation filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki had been more hands on, THE SECRET WORLD OF ARRIETTY may have been even more of a rewarding film. Although, okay, Miyazaki did write the screenplay, which does make it pretty hands on as it is. But something felt missing when I watched it. And, ultimately, while it didn't enrapt me as thoroughly, I can still appreciate the film's sense of delicacy and Studio Ghibli's predictably gorgeous animation.Based on Mary Norton's classic THE BORROWERS, THE SECRET WORLD OF ARRIETTY - or, as they call it in more exotic places: ""Kari-gurashi no Arietti"" - tells of a diminutive race of people called the Borrowers who survive on sneak and by ""borrowing"" everyday household items from the oblivious humans, y'know, stuff that won't be missed. Arrietty is a Borrower, standing at four inches and, at near fourteen years of age, fearless and adventurous. Arrietty's family lives in secret under the floorboards of a sprawling countryside house, except that when you're only four inches tall, this house encompasses an entire universe.Borrowers take only what they need. Borrowers must never be seen by a human. To be seen by a human means having to relocate, because ""Once a borrower has been seen, the humans' curiosity can't be stopped."" These are the rules that have been pounded into Arrietty's head since forever long, never mind that the sickly human boy who'd just moved in had just caught a fleeting glimpse of her. Arrietty can barely contain her excitement. She's about to embark with her father on her first official borrowing mission. Her father is stoic but dependable. Her mother is eternally twitchy. Arrietty's expedition ends unexpectedly, with perhaps a tenuous friendship coalescing behind a box of tissues. Or should I say, a forbidden friendship?I think, 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one. First, the good stuff: The animation is remarkable. This film isn't as frenetic in movement as, say, HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE or SPIRITED AWAY, so it relies more on a sense of quiet visual elegance. Your eyes are drawn to the background scenes, to the exquisite detail work, to how lushly and vividly the animators have rendered the gently swaying trees and the leaves and blades of grass and such. This is specially arresting when juxtaposed with the Borrowers' miniature figures. Maybe the most memorable visual sequence surfaces when Arrietty, during her first borrowing jaunt, finds herself standing on the precipice, gazing out in awe at the vast, yawning chasm that constitutes the humans' kitchen. That scene, better than others, allows us an insightful visual cue in terms of scale as viewed from a Borrower's perspective.And I thought the American voice actors were fine, with Bridgit Mendler (from GOOD LUCK, CHARLIE) turning in an immediately sympathetic and very natural performance.So I liked THE SECRET WORLD OF ARRIETTY, but didn't quite love it. There's a static feel. And maybe that's partly because there isn't much of a story conflict. The plot is paper thin. I mentioned that, visually, this film isn't as frenetic in motion as past Studio Ghibli pictures. It also isn't as complex in story content or as rich in character work. The characters don't really evolve, excepting, I guess, the sickly human boy who gains a more optimistic outlook. The film's designated ""big bad"" is merely this nosy housemaid who suspects the existence of nasty, thieving little people who live in the wall. For me, the biggest flaw may have been in that there aren't enough scenes of the human kid and Arrietty together, establishing their friendship. Their emotional farewell scene at the end doesn't feel earned, because their friendship feels forced, or if not forced, then perfunctory. Ultimately, THE SECRET WORLD OF ARRIETTY is very watchable, with breathtaking visuals and nice moments of melancholy and sensitivity. But it fails to resonate across the board. For me, as much as I dig the plucky Arrietty, the film ends up being just... pleasant. But it's definitely worth watching.The DVD's paltry bonus features:- Bridgit Mendler ""Summertime"" Music Video- The Making Of ""Summertime"" (00:02:02 minutes)",4,"""Why is my first thought always that he got eaten by the cat?

Great theory for all those missing socks!You may recognize a few voices from the two English language versions:* Bridgit Mendler (lots of TV) is Arrietty, American version; a happy, obedient girl, mastering the skills necessary to live in the walls and floorboards of a house while hiding from (human) ""beings.""* Saoirse Ronan (""Hanna"") is Arrietty, UK version; she reminds us that Borrowers do not steal unnecessary items.* Moises Arias (lots of TV and the upcoming ""Ender's Game"") is Spiller, American version; a kind, lonely boy whose only friend is his aunt's cat.* Luke Allen-Gale (lots of TV and ""Captain America"") is Spiller, UK version; his heart surgery is scheduled and he hopes his future will be healthier.* Will Arnett (lots of TV and the upcoming ""Arrested Development"") is Pod, American version; taciturn and strong, a perfect but distant father figure.* Mark Strong (""The Guard"") is Pod, UK version; is there anything this actor can't do?The children in the audience were mesmerized by the challenge of climbing up an ivy vine or rappelling down the front of a kitchen cabinet when you're only four inches tall. The contrast between standard size and miniature is fascinating, e.g., when a lone sugar cube becomes an item of vital interest between these two youngsters.For excitement, we have a house cat who sees Borrowers as prey, and Sadako, the maid/housekeeper, who suspects there are ""little thieves"" infesting their house so she calls the exterminators. Eek!This takes place in Japan, so I was interested to see that the Mercedes had the steering wheel on the left, while the Japanese car had it on the right. Little touches like that please me. And I was relieved when Sadako cut air holes in the jar lid so her captive wouldn't suffocate.We always need someone to root for and Arrietty and her family are just the ticket!

Maybe you didn't lose it and Arrietty or one of her family stole it, er, I mean borrowed it...This movie is based on the book ""The Borrowers"" which is a very good and popular book for children through adults. The protagonist is Arrietty who is the young 14 year old daughter of a family of borrowers. This book covers their life and interaction with the ""beans"" (human beings) and the home they have lived in for generations.It is a very cute story and the graphics and wonderfully done and the scenes in the fields of flowers are just beautiful. There is a strong Japanese tone to the movie, of course, as the young boy eats with chop sticks and the exterminator van side markings are in Japanese script. I only bring this up as the movie is not consistent in its cultural presentation.I won't go into the storyline as you should watch the movie and make your own judgments. The movie is a little slow at times and the mixture of cultures adds a little strangeness to the story. One music background will be Japanese based and the next scene obviously has music dubbed in by Disney to Americanize the movie. I would have preferred one or the other and probably staying with the Japanese style would have been better as the movie was made in Japan.My grandson liked the movie and so did my wife and I.

To be specific, we are a family of three with a teenager in high school, and everybody just loved this beautiful new animated movie that's perfect for all groups.  As with all the movies Ghibli Studio produces, this is a rich visual masterpiece that you will really get lost in, with very life-like vegetation and insect life serving as a background for a seemingly simple, but very heartfelt story.Mr. Miyazaki does not disappoint, retelling the original children's story ""Borrowers"" by Mary Norton and placing it in the present, with the main characters being Shawn, a sickly boy who is sent to live with his great aunt and her maid Hara, where he discovers a secret family of tiny people that includes husband and wife Pod and Homily and Arrietty, their 13-year-old daughter who is just learning to ""borrow,"" something her kind does to survive.  As the story unravels, Arrietty's adventures are highlighted by wonderful scenes of the world from a point of view of a 4-inch tall person.The ending of this movie does not disappoint, and I am definitely planning to see this movie several more times with my nephews, and to buy the DVD when it comes out to add to my Miyazaki collection.

486930,A3F9VH8916IA40,779913027X,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[0, 0]","My love for Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli know no bounds. With each film they manage to capture the magic, the art, and the heart that make films great. Even what I consider their weaker films, such as Ponyo or Kiki's Delivery Service are good films and always leave me smiling and happy (well, with the exception of Tales From Earthsea). The Secret World of Arrrietty is no exception, and in many ways I believe serves as an example of one of their better films.  It's not as grandiose as Princess Mononoke or Nausicaa, nor is it as imaginative as Castle in the Sky or Spirited Away, but what it lacks in these areas in more than makes up for in style, heart, and awe inspiring beauty. To take such a simple film, with such basic conflict, and turn it into such a great film as this is really a testament to the kind of studio Ghibli is, and the quality of films Miyazaki creates.When I was in college my creative writing teacher drilled into my head over and over, ""character, character, character,"" for even the simplest of stories can take on a life of their own when inhabited by people we know and care about. That is the strength of all Ghibli films, but this one especially. Arrietty is a fantastic character who runs the gauntlet of believable emotions and personal conflict, anywhere from excitable and curious, to guilt and remorse. By the end of the film we really feel as if she's grown as a character and learned from her experience in a way that would feel forced in most children's movies today but in the talented hands of Ghibli it's all very natural. With as simple a story as this is it really relies upon the characters a great deal. A young boy named Shawn has come to visit the house his mother grew up in to rest and prepare for heart surgery he fears he might not survive. While there he stumbles upon a young borrow named Arrietty who, along with her father, was attempting to borrow a lump of sugar for her mother. Over time Shawn and Arrietty strike an unlikely friendship but much like your standard Romeo and Juliet story (except without the romance) the differences between them keep vying to keep them apart.Everything in this movie is wonderful. The animation is stunning, I might even be tempted to call this Ghibli's best animation yet. The music fits perfectly with the visuals, the characters are rich and varied, the designs are perfect, there's not a whole lot I can say in the realm of negatives. One thing I really loved was how big and menacing they make our world look through the eyes of Arrietty. Sure, from our perspective there's nothing scary or dangerous about a kitchen, but when you three inches tall something as simple as getting some tissue paper can be a daunting task.I've rambled enough. Simply put, if you're a fan of Studio Ghibli or just like a good family film, you really owe it to yourself to see this movie. By the end I had teared up just a little bit, not because this movie is sad, but because it's just so damn beautiful.  Hey, Ghibli films will do that to you.

The music score and film sound effects are terrific. The 2d animation is fabulous, and the imagery of the house and its interior, plants, and its surroundings are gorgeous (as expected from Studio Ghibli, one of the most highly regarded and respected animation studios in the world).I usually prefer the original Japanese language with English subtitles for films like these, but if the English dub, acting, and translation is good then it's a real blessing for introducing and sharing with those new friends that prefer English dub only.I wasn't as happy with the Disney English voice acting in contrast to the voice acting in Ponyo: I thought Nausicaa of the Valley Wind and Ponyo English dubs to be stronger.  But don't let my view bother you since the  Secret World of Arrietty DVD has a Japanese track, English track, and French track (with English subtitles) to help you experience this beautiful little gem for yourself.******Also, here are other interesting and different animation film experiences you might enjoy: 'Kiki's Delivery Service', 'The Last Unicorn', 'Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron', 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind', 'Animal Treasure Island', and 'Watership Down'.******",4,Small Treasures,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,1394,"['enjoy', 'Studio', 'Ghibi', 'Secret', 'world', 'Arrietty', 'more', 'Ghibli', 'Ponyo', 'also', 'thought', 'ending', 'Arrietty', 'was', 'less', 'rushed', 'more', 'organized', 'Ponyo', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'music', 'score', 'film', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'terrific', '2d', 'animation', 'fabulous', 'imagery', 'house', 'interior', 'plants', 'surroundings', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'expected', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'one', 'most', 'highly', 'regarded', 'respected', 'animation', 'studios', 'world', 'usually', 'prefer', 'original', 'Japanese', 'language', 'English', 'subtitles', 'films', 'English', 'dub', 'acting', 'translation', 'good', 'then', 'real', 'blessing', 'introducing', 'sharing', 'new', 'friends', 'prefer', 'English', 'dub', 'only.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'Disney', 'English', 'voice', 'acting', 'contrast', 'voice', 'acting', 'Ponyo', 'thought', 'Nausicaa', 'Valley', 'Wind', 'Ponyo', 'English', 'dubs', 'be', 'stronger', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'view', 'Secret', 'World', 'Arrietty', 'DVD', 'Japanese', 'track', 'English', 'track', 'French', 'track', 'English', 'subtitles', 'help', 'experience', 'beautiful', 'little', 'gem', '******Also', 'here', 'are', 'other', 'interesting', 'different', 'animation', 'film', 'experiences', 'might', 'enjoy', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'Last', 'Unicorn', ""'Spirit"", 'Stallion', 'Cimarron', ""'Nausicaa"", 'Valley', 'Wind', ""'Animal"", 'Treasure', 'Island', 'Down', '******']",The Secret World of Arrietty (Mandarin Chinese Edition)
486937,A120V3RVSK1O1K,779913027X,K. Ostrowski,"[2, 6]","I have a special place in my heart for Studio Ghibli.  The only problem I've really had with most Ghibli films in the past has been their tendency to have plots driven mainly by the occult.This movie, fortunately, lacks that element of the Miyazaki legacy, though I probably would have enjoyed it anyway.  In fact, in some ways, I think I enjoyed this movie more than any other production ever released by Studio Ghibli, which is high praise indeed.It's a story about a boy named Shawn, who goes to a small house in the countryside, where he discovers a family of very small people, who survive by taking what they need from the humans they live with; little things that people won't miss.  The tiny people call themselves borrowers, and often refer to the humans as ""beans.""  The family consists of an old married couple and their teenage daughter Arrietty.The plot picks up when Arrietty is seen by Shawn, and the two begin a sort of strange friendship, which, unfortunately, can never be, since all borrowers know that to be seen by one human invites the curiosity and greed of the others, a fact which is proven jarringly true for the poor borrower family.The father of the family is somber, softspoken and savvy.  He's something of an action hero, because he needs to be to take care of his family, getting in and out of kitchens and bedrooms quickly and without anyone seeing him.  He also seems to be a master craftsman in many fields.  His wife is herself very creative and skilled, demonstrating skill in knitting and cooking, though the primary impression that she's likely to leave on viewers is her tendency to worry.Both Arrietty and Shawn are curious souls seeking to understand and bear life as best they can; figuring out how to get by, one step at a time, like all of us.Ghibli films have a long history of taking their time and showing the viewers absolutely stunning sights.  Every single Ghibli film is gorgeous to look at, and yet, they tend to be patient affairs as well.  They allow a world of wonder to unfold before the eyes of the viewer; a world with its own problems and trials, like ours, and they take their time in doing it, instead of rushing around in big, flashy musical numbers and telling joke after ridiculous joke.This film is certainly no exception to that.  None of the characters sing, nor do they tell jokes.  Many of them are introspective and quiet, and yet, the subject matter is such that it's hard to grow impatient with the movie.  I would say that this film is probably slower-paced and less intense than any other Ghibli film, but I actually thought the movie benefitted from its quiet atmosphere, as very tiny people trying hard not to be seen would, naturally, make very little noise.In the end, though, as I said, the thing I liked most about it was that its premise was something nobody could take issue with.  Witches, magic potions, evil wizards and superpowered crystals could all be troublesome subjects for young children to absorb, but little people in an old house is the kind of fantasy that anyone can get into.  There's even one scene of Arrietty's mother briefly praying for her daughter and husband.  They do technically live by stealing things from humans, but because of their size, nothing they take is really that big of a deal, even according to the catechism of the Catholic Church.  It's a distinction that may need to be made by parents after the film is over, but certainly not a problem with the movie itself.There are also quite a few good moral messages to be derived from this kind of story.  ""A person's a person, no matter how small,"" ""sometimes, even the smallest person can make the biggest difference,"" and even a message about how the power of goodness (in this case, courage,) can be made most perfect in weakness.  However, the film isn't perfect, and most of that, I suspect, has to do with the dubbing.  A few of the lines feel overly-familiar and almost cookie-cuttered in, and Shawn's voice could have stood to gain a few octaves.  He sounded like he was in his late 20s.Still, I recommend this movie heartily to anyone who has a child or is still a child at heart; still willing to dream of other worlds beyond our own, which is really the point of most Ghibli features when you get down to it.  They do just what I want a film to do, elevating our minds to other possibilities and other worlds.  This one manages to make even a normal world look alien and strange, and thus maintain its strong level of interest for the child in all of us.  Most especially, I recommend this movie to those who, like myself, are religious and seeking a quieter, calmer alternative to the American ""entertainment"" of today.",5,One of the Best Ghibli Features in My Opinion,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,4698,"['have', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'only', 'problem', ""'ve"", 'really', 'had', 'most', 'Ghibli', 'films', 'past', 'been', 'tendency', 'have', 'plots', 'driven', 'mainly', 'occult.This', 'movie', 'fortunately', 'element', 'Miyazaki', 'legacy', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'anyway', 'fact', 'ways', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'other', 'production', 'ever', 'released', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'high', 'praise', 'indeed.It', 'story', 'boy', 'named', 'Shawn', 'who', 'small', 'house', 'countryside', 'where', 'family', 'very', 'small', 'people', 'who', 'survive', 'taking', 'what', 'need', 'humans', 'live', 'little', 'things', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'tiny', 'people', 'call', 'borrowers', 'often', 'refer', 'humans', 'beans', 'family', 'old', 'married', 'couple', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Arrietty.The', 'plot', 'up', 'when', 'Arrietty', 'seen', 'Shawn', 'two', 'begin', 'sort', 'strange', 'friendship', 'unfortunately', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'borrowers', 'know', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'human', 'curiosity', 'greed', 'others', 'fact', 'proven', 'jarringly', 'true', 'poor', 'borrower', 'family.The', 'father', 'family', 'somber', 'softspoken', 'savvy', 'something', 'action', 'hero', 'be', 'take', 'care', 'family', 'getting', 'kitchens', 'bedrooms', 'quickly', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'also', 'be', 'master', 'craftsman', 'many', 'fields', 'wife', 'herself', 'very', 'creative', 'skilled', 'demonstrating', 'skill', 'knitting', 'cooking', 'primary', 'impression', 'likely', 'leave', 'viewers', 'tendency', 'worry.Both', 'Arrietty', 'Shawn', 'are', 'curious', 'souls', 'seeking', 'understand', 'bear', 'life', 'can', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'one', 'step', 'time', 'us.Ghibli', 'films', 'have', 'long', 'history', 'taking', 'time', 'showing', 'viewers', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'sights', 'single', 'Ghibli', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'yet', 'tend', 'be', 'patient', 'affairs', 'as', 'well', 'allow', 'world', 'wonder', 'unfold', 'eyes', 'viewer', 'world', 'own', 'problems', 'trials', 'ours', 'take', 'time', 'doing', 'instead', 'rushing', 'around', 'big', 'flashy', 'musical', 'numbers', 'telling', 'joke', 'ridiculous', 'joke.This', 'film', 'certainly', 'exception', 'None', 'characters', 'sing', 'do', 'tell', 'jokes', 'Many', 'are', 'introspective', 'quiet', 'yet', 'subject', 'matter', 'such', 'hard', 'grow', 'impatient', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'probably', 'slower-paced', 'less', 'intense', 'other', 'Ghibli', 'film', 'actually', 'thought', 'movie', 'benefitted', 'quiet', 'atmosphere', 'very', 'tiny', 'people', 'trying', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'would', 'naturally', 'make', 'very', 'little', 'end', 'though', 'said', 'thing', 'liked', 'most', 'was', 'premise', 'was', 'something', 'nobody', 'could', 'take', 'issue', 'Witches', 'magic', 'potions', 'evil', 'wizards', 'superpowered', 'crystals', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'troublesome', 'subjects', 'young', 'children', 'absorb', 'little', 'people', 'old', 'house', 'kind', 'fantasy', 'anyone', 'can', 'get', 'even', 'one', 'scene', 'Arrietty', 'mother', 'briefly', 'praying', 'daughter', 'husband', 'do', 'technically', 'live', 'stealing', 'things', 'humans', 'size', 'nothing', 'take', 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'even', 'according', 'catechism', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'distinction', 'may', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'parents', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'problem', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'few', 'good', 'moral', 'messages', 'be', 'derived', 'kind', 'story', 'person', 'person', 'matter', 'how', 'small', 'sometimes', 'even', 'smallest', 'person', 'can', 'make', 'biggest', 'difference', 'even', 'message', 'how', 'power', 'goodness', 'case', 'courage', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'most', 'perfect', 'weakness', 'However', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'most', 'suspect', 'do', 'dubbing', 'few', 'lines', 'feel', 'overly-familiar', 'almost', 'cookie-cuttered', 'Shawn', 'voice', 'could', 'have', 'stood', 'gain', 'few', 'octaves', 'sounded', 'was', 'late', '20s.Still', 'recommend', 'movie', 'heartily', 'anyone', 'who', 'child', 'still', 'child', 'heart', 'still', 'willing', 'dream', 'other', 'worlds', 'own', 'really', 'point', 'most', 'Ghibli', 'features', 'when', 'get', 'down', 'do', 'just', 'what', 'want', 'film', 'do', 'elevating', 'minds', 'other', 'possibilities', 'other', 'worlds', 'one', 'make', 'even', 'normal', 'world', 'look', 'alien', 'strange', 'thus', 'maintain', 'strong', 'level', 'interest', 'child', 'Most', 'especially', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'religious', 'seeking', 'quieter', 'calmer', 'alternative', 'American', 'entertainment', 'today']",The Secret World of Arrietty (Mandarin Chinese Edition)

The story seemed to be representative of class conflict in a society where the marginalized Borrower family tries to survive on the edges of the world of power and privilege, from which they are forever excluded as participants. We never learn why Pod, Homily, and Arrietty are living separately from the rest of Borrower society. After they meet the wild Spiller, it's clear that they are living in better circumstances than most Borrowers, but still beset by continual fear of discovery and destruction by the &#34;Human Beans,&#34; who run the gamut of helpful, curious, or deliberately malevolent. There is no danger that the proletariat here will revolt; regardless of how many of them there may be, their only wish is to live in peace and be left alone.The story is told in Miyazaki's Anime-influenced style of detailed backgrounds and simpler characters. Though not at the same level as his masterpieces &#34;Princess Mononoke&#34; and &#34;Spirited Away,&#34; it's incomparably better than the embarassing &#34;Ponyo.&#34; Though the animation and pacing are uniformly excellent across all of his films, the stories are inconsistent in quality.

This latest work from Hayao Miyazaki has many of the classic arctypes in characters seen in other Miyazaki films, but with major departures in appearance of the main character archtype.Taking on a fantasy that is this absurd--literally little people, about 3"" tall, living under someone's house--is something Miyazaki manages to make quite real and believable. Like Howl's Moving Castle, Arrietty is based on a novel written by a western writer. But the details are in the devil, in this case, because the film takes us into this world in stunning detail that shows the evolution of Studio Ghibli talents. One wonders how they figured out all those unusual angles, seeing the world from the perspective of someone standing just 3"" tall.

My favorite film by them is ""Whisper of the Heart"", funny enough, it being the least action oriented film in their catalog. I got this film and it is definitely a Ghibli film... great animation, the little quirks, attention to details, the great voice acting and story are evident.My only real ""criticism"" of this film is that, though it starts off as most of the films in Ghibli's catalog, it develops (to me) a little too quickly. It paces okay at the beginning but the adventure is sort of... cut short.  It is a shorter film than ""Princess Mononoke"", ""Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind"", ""Howl's Moving Castle"" or ""Spirited Away"" and even the aforementioned ""Whisper..."". Now before I have a bunch of you flaming me because you think I'm downing this film: I'm not.  I just think they could have added about another 10 minutes or so to pace the more ""exciting parts"" and balance out the rest of the film better.I recommend this all Studio Ghibli or Disney fans, this film is more in line with ""Whisper of the Heart"", ""Ponyo"" or ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" -none of the darker themes or violence of the above mentioned films.  This film is still above par, looks fantastic and is well voiced and ""acted"" -I just feel the pacing could have been drawn out a bit to allow the film to breathe more instead of feeling rushed.Again, I highly recommend this -the critique above is my opinion and should not deter you from seeing, or purchasing -this film.",4,Another Excellent Studio Ghibli film,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,1555,"['Okay', ""'m"", 'adult', 'fan', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'films', 'there', 'just', 'had', 'get', 'way', 'favorite', 'film', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'funny', 'enough', 'being', 'least', 'action', 'oriented', 'film', 'catalog', 'got', 'film', 'definitely', 'Ghibli', 'film', 'great', 'animation', 'little', 'quirks', 'attention', 'details', 'great', 'voice', 'acting', 'story', 'are', 'evident.My', 'only', 'real', 'criticism', 'film', 'off', 'most', 'films', 'Ghibli', 'catalog', 'little', 'too', 'quickly', 'okay', 'beginning', 'adventure', 'sort', 'cut', 'short', 'shorter', 'film', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Nausica', 'auml', 'Valley', 'Wind', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'even', 'aforementioned', 'Whisper', 'Now', 'have', 'bunch', 'flaming', 'think', ""'m"", 'downing', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'added', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'pace', 'more', 'exciting', 'parts', 'balance', 'out', 'rest', 'film', 'better.I', 'recommend', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'Disney', 'fans', 'film', 'more', 'line', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'Ponyo', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', '-none', 'darker', 'themes', 'violence', 'above', 'mentioned', 'films', 'film', 'still', 'par', 'fantastic', 'well', 'voiced', 'acted', '-I', 'just', 'feel', 'pacing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'out', 'bit', 'allow', 'film', 'breathe', 'more', 'instead', 'feeling', 'rushed.Again', 'highly', 'recommend', '-the', 'critique', 'opinion', 'should', 'not', 'deter', 'seeing', 'purchasing', '-this', 'film']",The Secret World of Arrietty (Mandarin Chinese Edition)

486964,A15LK8DSFQZZ52,779913027X,"Patricia R. Andersen ""redheaded booklover""","[1, 2]","I love Studio  Ghibli's work Studio Ghibli Movie Collection. Tthe loving attention to each scene, even the tiniest details, makes their movies beautiful to watch.You probably are familiar with the storyThe Borrowers. The characters are Arrietty (voiced by Bridgit Mendler) who lives with her parents (voiced by Will Arnett and Amy Poehler) underneath the floorboards in a beautiful house in the Japanese country side. Life can be dangerous for these little people - cats, birds, bugs and ""Beans"" (humans) could easily hurt them or destroy their whole household.It seems to be generally quiet until Sean/Shawn (voiced by David Henrie) shows up to rest up for a heart operation. Obviously he is frail and has been overprotected, but his parents are much too busy to come stay with him. Instead, he is entrusted to Hara the housekeeper (voiced by Carol Burnett*). Now I love Carol Burnett's work, but she is not a good pick for this particular character. You know it's Carol Burnett as soon as she speaks and because of that, you have certain expectations from the character. Her voice took me out of the suspension of belief in the movie. I know Disney makes sure to get ""name"" actors to do the dubbing, but I believe that is so wrong. There are so many good voice actors out there - one of those should have been assigned the role of Hara. (By the way, I didn't feel that way about the other voices used for the dubbing - just Carol Burnett's voice).Anyway, Shawn accidentally sees Arietty. This is a terrible thing because that means Arriety and her family will have to move. ""Beans"" don't take kindly to ""Borrowers"" and generally resort to force to get rid of the Borrowers.  But slowly and believably, Shawn and Arietty become friends. Shawn and Arriety manage to make a huge change in each other's  lives despite the vast amount of difference between the two.The animation is beautiful. Each cloud, each blade of grass, each poppy and marigold are rendered in enchanting watercolors. The details are so precise. It's just lovely to watch the artwork.Japanese animation has a look and feel different from American animation. The story has a slower pace, nothing is Disneyfied for the inevitable tie-ins of toys, Happy Meals and tv specials. The story is simply told. There's no magical solution to ensure a perfect ""happily ever after"" ending. But it is a good ending.Personally, when I watch this movie again (and I will), I will watch it in Japanese with English subtitles. There is so much less dialog in the Japanese version and of course, Carol Burnett isn't lending her voice to the Hara character. If you are watching this with a child, you probably will want to use the dubbed version.Either way you watch this movie, it is beautiful and brilliant. I recommend this highly to everybody.* I think Carol Burnett is an amazing comedian and I enjoy her work tremendously. But ""name"" actors seem to taint their roles with what you know about the actor's worker. If you use voice actors....well, that's how they make their living by making different voices. I think it would make it a much better film. And it's not just this film, it's any foreign film. And no, I am not a voice actor and don't know any voice actors personally. Nobody paid me to say it. It's just what I believe.",5,loved it,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,3285,"['love', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'work', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'Movie', 'Collection', 'Tthe', 'loving', 'attention', 'scene', 'even', 'tiniest', 'details', 'movies', 'beautiful', 'watch.You', 'probably', 'are', 'familiar', 'storyThe', 'Borrowers', 'characters', 'are', 'Arrietty', 'voiced', 'Bridgit', 'Mendler', 'who', 'parents', 'voiced', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'floorboards', 'beautiful', 'house', 'Japanese', 'country', 'side', 'Life', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'little', 'people', 'cats', 'birds', 'bugs', 'Beans', 'humans', 'could', 'easily', 'hurt', 'destroy', 'whole', 'household.It', 'be', 'generally', 'quiet', 'Sean/Shawn', 'voiced', 'David', 'Henrie', 'up', 'rest', 'up', 'heart', 'operation', 'Obviously', 'frail', 'been', 'overprotected', 'parents', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'busy', 'come', 'stay', 'Instead', 'entrusted', 'Hara', 'housekeeper', 'voiced', 'Carol', 'Burnett*', 'Now', 'love', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'work', 'not', 'good', 'pick', 'particular', 'character', 'know', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'as', 'soon', 'have', 'certain', 'expectations', 'character', 'voice', 'took', 'suspension', 'belief', 'movie', 'know', 'Disney', 'sure', 'get', 'name', 'actors', 'do', 'dubbing', 'believe', 'so', 'wrong', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'voice', 'actors', 'out', 'there', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'assigned', 'role', 'Hara', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'other', 'voices', 'used', 'dubbing', 'just', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'voice', '.Anyway', 'Shawn', 'accidentally', 'Arietty', 'terrible', 'thing', 'Arriety', 'family', 'will', 'have', 'move', 'Beans', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'kindly', 'Borrowers', 'generally', 'resort', 'force', 'get', 'rid', 'Borrowers', 'slowly', 'believably', 'Shawn', 'Arietty', 'become', 'friends', 'Shawn', 'Arriety', 'manage', 'make', 'huge', 'change', 'other', 'lives', 'vast', 'amount', 'difference', 'two.The', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'cloud', 'blade', 'grass', 'poppy', 'marigold', 'are', 'rendered', 'enchanting', 'watercolors', 'details', 'are', 'so', 'precise', 'just', 'lovely', 'watch', 'artwork.Japanese', 'animation', 'look', 'feel', 'different', 'American', 'animation', 'story', 'slower', 'pace', 'nothing', 'Disneyfied', 'inevitable', 'tie-ins', 'toys', 'Happy', 'Meals', 'tv', 'specials', 'story', 'simply', 'told', 'magical', 'solution', 'ensure', 'perfect', 'happily', 'ever', 'ending', 'good', 'ending.Personally', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'will', 'will', 'watch', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'dialog', 'Japanese', 'version', 'course', 'Carol', 'Burnett', ""n't"", 'lending', 'voice', 'Hara', 'character', 'are', 'watching', 'child', 'probably', 'will', 'want', 'use', 'dubbed', 'version.Either', 'way', 'watch', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'brilliant', 'recommend', 'highly', 'everybody', 'think', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'amazing', 'comedian', 'enjoy', 'work', 'tremendously', 'name', 'actors', 'seem', 'taint', 'roles', 'what', 'know', 'actor', 'worker', 'use', 'voice', 'actors', '.well', 'how', 'make', 'living', 'making', 'different', 'voices', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'foreign', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'voice', 'actor', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'voice', 'actors', 'personally', 'Nobody', 'paid', 'say', 'just', 'what', 'believe']",The Secret World of Arrietty (Mandarin Chinese Edition)
486965,ABC8FXLD7W528,779913027X,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[1, 1]","As a huge fan of ""The Littles"" during my childhood, I was excited to see the animated film ""The Secret World of Arrietty,"" based on the story ""The Borrowers.""While this movie is different than ""The Littles,"" it does have the same basic concept of little people living within the walls of houses and borrowing only what they need to survive. As such, items used by large humans are converted into necessary items for the Borrowers. For example, Arrietty uses a stick pin for a sword to protect her while she partakes in adventures.In this movie, we are introduced to Arrietty, her mom Homily, and her dad, Pod.  They are tiny people who live a comfortable life at a home in the country where a large human, Shawn, is staying with his Aunt Jessica and the housekeeper, Hara.From the moment Shawn arrives at the house, he sees Arrietty in the yard. He's intrigued and wants to build a friendship with her. Arrietty isn't so sure. Her father has warned her to stay away from all humans because their lives would be endangered to do otherwise.However, Arrietty doesn't heed her father's advice. As such, her family soon has to move, as is customary when a Borrower is discovered by a large human.If you're looking for modern animation, you won't find it in ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" (not to say that the graphics aren't spectacular because they are vivid and colorful, just not what we in our contemporary movie-watching are accustomed to). However, what you will find is a sweet movie with a lot of heart - a movie reminiscent of the good old days of Saturday morning cartoons.There are some lessons to be learned in this movie. For one, Arrietty sees the result of her disobedience when her family is uprooted from their pleasant home and forced to move. A great reminder that all actions have consequences. Secondly, Arrietty's mom is a worrywart and at times, hysterical. Another great lesson that worrying solves nothing, but only creates more stress and shows a lack of faith.

486970,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,779913027X,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[106, 109]","This film is a must see for anyone who loves hand drawn animation. This is an experience filmgoers just don't get at the theater anymore and I praise studio Ghibli (and in tandem Disney as far as North America is concerned) for continuing this tradition. I also implore anyone who feels interested in seeing this film at any level go do so and support the studio, I would like to see them around for years to come and I don't think many will be disappointed with the experience.First of all, no, Miyazaki didn't actually direct this time around. He only penned and planned the story along with other production guidance. So I'm okay with saying this arguably isn't Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, or Howl's Moving Castle, but this is that studio Ghibli magic you love. I feel it closely kindred to Kiki's Delivery Service or My Neighbor Totoro. I personally fail to see how any Studio Ghibli fan could walk away from this film unhappy. For that matter I fail to see how any child at heart could walk away from this film without a smile on their face. Films like this evoke a feeling of childhood and a sense of wonder.The animation is gorgeous and possibly even more stimulating since we see virtually no hand drawn animation on the silver screen in North America (though so far this year I've been blessed with the Beauty and the Beast re-release and a Fullmetal Alchemist film at my small town theater). As far as Arrietty is concerned the background designers paid great attention to detail while the characters have that streamlined Miyazaki look but move with fluidity and such realism. It's very captivating to see the familiar concept of creatures living between floorboards in such a new inventive way. Seeing what they borrow from the humans and how they use it is part of the charm of the film. I also have to say that this film, like all Ghibli films, does such an excellent job of capturing the majesty of nature. The outdoor scenes here make one long to go for a hike in such an area.Characterization is also well done. While the characters may not seem as standout or unique as previous Ghibli releases they are all distinct and have formed personalities that are revealed in such refreshingly subtle ways, you don't get a bunch of exposition explaining characters you just see who they are through how they move and act. In this light it was also nice to see traits from the original borrowers material carried over into this representation (the mother being very worrisome, etc.). Arrietty is rightfully the most compelling character, a girl venturing into the larger world for the first time with fear but also curiosity and courage. One note, I would have liked to see more of the other characters, especially Sho/Shawn, but I was very pleased with what I did get to see.Voice acting is something I really have to give Disney credit for. Dubs are very hard to get right and I've found that they've put good effort into the casting and voice directing of their Ghibli dubs. The voices all sound like they are coming from the characters (with perhaps the debatable exception of David Henrie as Sho/Shawn, who does a great job but sounds a bit deep voiced for the young character), and 99% match the lip flaps. Bridgit Mendler as Arriety does a standout job, Amy Poehler and Will Arnett are charmingly cast as her parents and Carol Burnett is humorous as the house cleaner, Hara. The performances, like the film itself, are understated but very engrossing (for fans of this genre at least). I look forward to being able to listen to the original Japanese dialogue for comparison purposes but I think even those who don't enjoy dubs should give this one a try if it's the only option at your local theater.Lastly there is the sound. A key component of establishing the reality in any animated film. In Arrietty the sound has been well selected to evoke the feeling of an idyllic summer, especially in outdoor scenes. Sound was also extremely well used to establish Arrietty's unique perspective of the human world. For example, in one scene where Arrietty enters a human kitchen for the first time, the familiar sounds of appliances humming and an empty room at night are used to create a sense of unfamiliarity and vastness. In addition to the excellent sound design I must compliment the score of the film, the music fits well and has a Celtic influence that captures Arrietty's lively spirit.If there is a fault to be found it is the running time. At 94 minutes this film is one of Ghibli's shortest (only Totoro comes to mind as being shorter). With such an immersing experience at the beginning of the film I would have loved to spend more time in Arrietty's world exploring the day to day of their unique lifestyle. Further, once the story got going I would've loved more twists and turns that a longer running time might have allotted. A positive regarding the length is that the film will be an excellent experience for most children. One more note regarding children, parents should know that there is a discussion about death in the film. It depends on your children and their age but the characters discuss the fact that we all die someday in a brief scene, it is handled much like the circle of life discussion in Lion King so judge for yourselves, I can't see it being a problem.In conclusion, I suggest everyone take their children to see this film, it's a wonderful re-imagining of a wonderful tale and I dare say this is my favorite adaptation of The Borrowers story yet, and having grown up in Canada with BBC I've seen quite a few. I highly recommend fans of animation see this film and I hope Disney releases this Blu-ray quickly, I eagerly anticipate watching this beautiful animation in HD on my home theater. It's nice to experience a film that puts magic back into the movies.**I also eagerly anticipate the rest of Ghibli's catalog titles being released on Blu-ray, hopefully sooner than later.",5,A

486973,A4FX5YCJA630V,779913027X,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","There's nothing in the world like a Studio Ghibli film, and Mary Norton'sThe Borrowers(first published in 1952) is a story that seems tailor-made for the studio's magic touch. Granted, Hayao Miyazaki passed on his usual directing duties for this film, but contributed heavily to the script, making ""Arriety"" another strong installment in the Ghibli collection.Studio Ghibli films come in two distinct flavours: dark and epic (Princess Mononoke,Spirited Away,Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind) or light and gentle (Ponyo,My Neighbor Totoro,Kiki's Delivery Service). ""Arrietty"" definitely falls into the latter category, with a story that isn't afraid to unfold at a mild pace, taking its time as it establishes the mood, characters and setting, and which foregoes a complex plot for a very simple tale of transition and friendship.Sho is a young boy brought to his great-aunt's house in the country to prepare for a heart operation, one that he isn't expected to survive. During his stay, he almost immediately becomes aware of others living in the house: tiny people who survive by ""borrowing"" bits and pieces from the inhabitants.Arrietty is one such Borrower, a teenage girl about four inches tall who lives with her mother and father in the secret spaces under the floorboards and behind the walls. She's a delightful character, and it's very easy to see why Sho becomes completely enamored with her. In many ways she's a quintessential tomboy, one who scampers about the house, wields a tiny pin for a sword, and relishes any adventure that comes her way, but at the same time she's decidedly feminine - always garbed in a pretty skirt or dress, and scrupulously checking her hair every time she scoops it up out of her face with a tiny butterfly clip.Far from the portly and fastidious Pod of Norton's book, Arrietty's father is portrayed as strong and manly, though her mother Homily remains truer to Norton's vision of a worrisome and rather excitable woman. At the beginning of the film, Pod has come to the decision to teach Arrietty the ways of borrowing since - as far as he knows - they are the only three Borrowers left in the world. Arrietty needs to become self-sufficient if she's to survive, though Sho's curiosity and the meddling of the housekeeper Haru puts the tiny family into grave danger. If there's one thing a Borrower must never do, it's be seen by a ""human bean""...There are several departures from Mary Norton's book, and sadly many of the charming details of her series have been exorcised, specifically Arrietty's defense of how the Borrowers live their life (they don't steal, they simply borrow things that won't be missed) and their worldview (Arrietty of the book is astonished to hear of the Earth's population, having been raised to believe that humans exist solely to provide for Borrowers). Yet Studio Ghibli adds plenty of its own magic to compensate, reveling in the challenge it sets for itself: exploring how tiny people might navigate and negotiate a giant house.The first time Arrietty sets foot in the kitchen, the film takes the time to convey its vastness to a girl her size: the echoes, the drops, the loud ticking of a clock, the immensity of space that lies between the bench, the floor and the tabletop. The attention to detail given to perspective and spatial relationships leads to some of the film's most innovative scenes, such as when Arrietty hitches a ride on Sho's shoulder. First we see the event from Sho's viewpoint, as he casually carries Arrietty across the room, only for the perspective to switch to Arrietty, who is travelling so fast that the hair is lifted from her shoulders.Beautiful animation is a staple feature for any Studio Ghibli film, and here they take full advantage of the opportunities the setup provides for them, looking at the world from a high and low point-of-view. Perhaps my favourite detail is the way the Borrowers deal with water: whenever they pour themselves a drink, they only need a single large drop to sip from. Another fascinating touch is the way Arrietty reacts when Sho sees her for the first time: such is the Borrower taboo against being seen by anyone that her response is what you'd expect from a young girl who has just been seen without her clothes on - and later Sho is perceptive enough to ask permission before looking directly at her.It takes real skill to fill an ordinary house with wonder and mystery and danger, but Studio Ghibli succeeds, making even the spaces behind the walls fascinating. There's also plenty of variety regarding the voice actors: not only the original Japanese cast, but also a British and American dub. I personally preferred the British cast (including Mark Strong, Saoirse Ronan and Geraldine McEwan) simply because the Borrowers is such a quintessentially English story, but each has its pros and cons. For example, the American dub makes it clear that Sho (or Shawn) survives his operation, whilst the English dub has a few jarring scenes - Sho talks in an oddly pleased tone to Arrietty about how the Borrowers must be an ""endangered species"" who are ""dying out."" Between that and the scene in which he uproots their kitchen in order to replace it with the one in the doll's house, you get the sense that he's actually trying to traumatize them!As well as this, there is some Celtic music and songs that plays rather too loudly over quiet scenes, but for the most part, this is another winner from Studio Ghibli. It's always hard to know how a child will react to a film such as this, especially since children's films these days are hyperactive and more often than not reliant on a hefty dose of toilet humour. So there's no telling how an average five-to-ten year old will respond to the slow pace and non-eventful storyline here, especially sense the film foregoes the usual beginning/middle/end format of traditional Western films in order to tell a story that plays out more like a slice of life; a transitional phase that concludes on a very open-ended note (in fact, you may be surprised to see the end credits start rolling). You really get a sense that these characters existed long before the film started, and that they'll carry on with their lives after it ends - and we the audience are only allowed a small glimpse into their existence.There is nothing in the world like a Studio Ghibli film, for they consistently capture the innocence and wonder that used to epitomize the Disney animated franchise (there's a reason Hayao Miyazaki is called ""the Walt Disney of Japan""). In this case ""Arrietty"" takes a very simple premise and creates magic with it, starring a heroine that manages to be as ordinary as she is extraordinary.",5,"""We've Been Seen!""",1372464000,"06 29,

The pacing and feel is perfect, and the musical score is beautiful, as others have mentioned, a lot of it lush, Celtic type music, with some vocal songs used in the background as mood elements.

486983,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,779913027X,Stephen M. Lerch,"[0, 0]","The Secret World of Arrietty is based on the children's bookThe Borrowers. Borrowers are little people, essentially, that live hidden around the world. This family has taken up residence, apparently for many years, in a house where a young boy, Sho, needs to rest. Sho knows the Borrowers exist and keeps an eye out, eventually catching sight of Arrietty.Being a Ghibli film, while there is a character with some level of malicious intent, this character never really seems bent on killing the family. Instead she seems to want to capture them simply to prove to the world that these little people exist.I really enjoyed the film and will definitely be watching it again.Video:Most impressive. 1080p AVC encoded. Clean, crisp and clear.The animation, as is always the case with Ghibli, is super impressive. Things you wouldn't normally pay attention to, like a grasshopper in the corner, are there and animated, inviting you to immerse yourself in the world in an attempt to enjoy every last detail.Audio:This is where some people will invariably be upset. The Borrowers is a UK children's story. Based on the heritage of the source, they actually got the film earlier than we did here in North America. They also had an English dub created for their version of the film. Early reports about the Disney release was that it would contain two English dubs, the UK dub and a US based dub. It turns out this reporting was FALSE. The final product has only ONE dub included, and that dub is the Disney created English dub.So there is NO UK English dub on this release.What is included are Japanese, English and French 5.1 DTS-MA encodes. Each track is flawless. Sounds are well placed and actually make decent use of the sound stage.Also included are optional English subtitles. While I am not a Japanese language master, I will say that there are some things I would have maybe translated differently, but in all honesty none of what is included is removed from the spirit of what is being said.Extras:You can watch a feature length storyboard version of the film, Japanese language track w/ subtitles only.There is also a music video, with making of, for the theme song written for the US English dub by Bridgit Mendler (US English dub voice of Arrietty). If you didn't like the dub and the change to the theme songs (something Disney always seems to do for some reason), then you won't enjoy these. I skipped them as I'm more interested in the Japanese side of things, but I can see how someone's children may like to see this.Another extra is the ""Arrietty's Song"" performed by Cecile Corbel video. This was a song created for the film and was not changed/modified/edited by Disney. Video is OK.The final extra is a collection of Japanese theatrical trailers (13 minutes worth).Considering how many extras were on the Japanese release (interviews with Miyazaki and Yonebayashi and a 43 minute TV special), it's disappointing to not see them replicated here.While the storyboard part is neat, I wish we had a Making of the Movie video instead. Since this is all that is included, I would say the Extras get 3 stars at best.Overall:Arrietty is a fantastic film. Despite the controversy over the English language dubs, if you can look past whatever your particular view might be, this film is absolutely beautiful. It's so easy to just get caught up in the beautiful splendor of the animation and forget all about the audio happening around the visuals.I understand the disappointment. It's too bad that the UK release is region locked (done on purpose so that Disney wouldn't sue I guess). Perhaps there will be a release that will include this in the future?In the end, Arrietty is worth seeing. The Blu Ray release is reference quality material, and would easily fit into a demo material pile.VERY Highly recommended.",5,"Great tansfer, great film",1370217600,"06 3, 2013",2013,3816,"['Secret', 'World', 'Arrietty', 'based', 'children', 'bookThe', 'Borrowers', 'Borrowers', 'are', 'little', 'people', 'essentially', 'live', 'hidden', 'world', 'family', 'taken', 'up', 'residence', 'apparently', 'many', 'years', 'house', 'where', 'young', 'boy', 'Sho', 'rest', 'Sho', 'Borrowers', 'exist', 'eye', 'out', 'eventually', 'catching', 'sight', 'Arrietty.Being', 'Ghibli', 'film', 'character', 'level', 'malicious', 'intent', 'character', 'never', 'really', 'bent', 'killing', 'family', 'Instead', 'want', 'capture', 'simply', 'prove', 'world', 'little', 'people', 'exist.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'watching', 'Most', 'impressive', '1080p', 'AVC', 'encoded', 'Clean', 'crisp', 'clear.The', 'animation', 'always', 'case', 'Ghibli', 'super', 'impressive', 'Things', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'pay', 'attention', 'grasshopper', 'corner', 'are', 'there', 'animated', 'inviting', 'immerse', 'world', 'attempt', 'enjoy', 'last', 'detail.Audio', 'where', 'people', 'will', 'invariably', 'be', 'upset', 'Borrowers', 'UK', 'children', 'story', 'Based', 'heritage', 'source', 'actually', 'got', 'film', 'earlier', 'did', 'here', 'North', 'America', 'also', 'had', 'English', 'dub', 'created', 'version', 'film', 'Early', 'reports', 'Disney', 'release', 'was', 'would', 'contain', 'two', 'English', 'dubs', 'UK', 'dub', 'US', 'based', 'dub', 'out', 'reporting', 'was', 'FALSE', 'final', 'product', 'only', 'ONE', 'dub', 'included', 'dub', 'Disney', 'created', 'English', 'dub.So', 'NO', 'UK', 'English', 'dub', 'release.What', 'included', 'are', 'Japanese', 'English', 'French', '5.1', 'DTS-MA', 'encodes', 'track', 'flawless', 'Sounds', 'are', 'well', 'placed', 'actually', 'make', 'decent', 'use', 'sound', 'stage.Also', 'included', 'are', 'optional', 'English', 'subtitles', 'am', 'not', 'Japanese', 'language', 'master', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'maybe', 'translated', 'differently', 'honesty', 'none', 'what', 'included', 'removed', 'spirit', 'what', 'being', 'said.Extras', 'can', 'watch', 'feature', 'length', 'storyboard', 'version', 'film', 'Japanese', 'language', 'track', 'w/', 'subtitles', 'only.There', 'also', 'music', 'video', 'making', 'theme', 'song', 'written', 'US', 'English', 'dub', 'Bridgit', 'Mendler', 'US', 'English', 'dub', 'voice', 'Arrietty', 'did', ""n't"", 'dub', 'change', 'theme', 'songs', 'something', 'Disney', 'always', 'do', 'reason', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'skipped', ""'m"", 'more', 'interested', 'Japanese', 'side', 'things', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'children', 'may', 'like', 'see', 'this.Another', 'extra', 'Arrietty', 'Song', 'performed', 'Cecile', 'Corbel', 'video', 'was', 'song', 'created', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'changed/modified/edited', 'Disney', 'Video', 'OK.The', 'final', 'extra', 'collection', 'Japanese', 'theatrical', 'trailers', '13', 'minutes', 'worth', '.Considering', 'how', 'many', 'extras', 'were', 'Japanese', 'release', 'interviews', 'Miyazaki', 'Yonebayashi', '43', 'minute', 'TV', 'special', 'disappointing', 'not', 'see', 'replicated', 'storyboard', 'part', 'neat', 'wish', 'had', 'Making', 'Movie', 'video', 'instead', 'included', 'would', 'say', 'Extras', 'get', '3', 'stars', 'best.Overall', 'Arrietty', 'fantastic', 'film', 'controversy', 'English', 'language', 'dubs', 'can', 'look', 'past', 'particular', 'view', 'might', 'be', 'film', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'so', 'easy', 'just', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'beautiful', 'splendor', 'animation', 'forget', 'audio', 'happening', 'visuals.I', 'understand', 'disappointment', 'too', 'bad', 'UK', 'release', 'region', 'locked', 'done', 'purpose', 'Disney', 'would', ""n't"", 'sue', 'guess', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'be', 'release', 'will', 'include', 'future', 'end', 'Arrietty', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release', 'reference', 'quality', 'material', 'would', 'easily', 'fit', 'demo', 'material', 'pile.VERY', 'Highly', 'recommended']",The Secret World of Arrietty (Mandarin Chinese Edition)

This film is like moving art. Beautiful visuals and beautifully haunting music really add to the films moody story. Some have complained that the story is too simple and that the length of the film is too short. I couldn't disagree more. I think one of the problems of many Ghibli films is that they are too long winded and could stand to be edited a bit. I didn't feel the story was too simple, rather I felt it was more personal and small scale, like a well written independent film. It focused on conversation and storytelling not on a grad complicated plot. It left a lot of breathing room for the ambient music and visuals to really set in, creating a mood that washes over the viewer.This story did seem a bit mature for really young viewers.

486989,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,779913027X,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 1]","""The Secret World of Arrietty,"" based on the children's novel ""The Borrowers,"" is an animated tale of little people who live quietly under the floorboards of houses, taking whatever small items they need for survival.  They pride themselves on never being seen by the Beans (what they call human beings) who live just above them.  Their greatest fear is discovery.Arrietty (voice of Bridgit Mendler) is a 14-year-old Borrower girl who lives with her mother and father in the home of young Shawn's (David Henrie) great aunt.  Shawn is frail and is under the care of housekeeper Hara (Carol Burnett) while his busy parents are at work.  Shawn spends his time reading, lounging on the grass, and playing with his cat.  One day, he catches a glimpse of what he thinks is a tiny girl climbing the leaves of a bush.  Eventually, Shawn and Arrietty become friends and Shawn becomes a strong ally when Arrietty and her family are in danger of losing their home.The style of animation is Japanese anime, which differs markedly from American animation.  It is more water-colored in appearance, less bright, with pastels predominating, and the main characters have huge, expressive, saucer-sized eyes.  The pace is far less frenetic than in typical modern animated features.  This slower pace may be difficult for younger kids to take, since there aren't any songs, cutesy sidekicks, or broad slapstick.  The strength of the movie is its story, which is solid, fascinating and, happily, not a sequel.What strikes you immediately is the care and detail in nearly every frame.  As a car makes its way down a tree-covered dirt road, we see mottled sunlight patterns changing as the car moves along.  During a summer rain shower, we see individual droplets hitting a stream and creating circular wavelets.  In Arrietty's home, there are miniature kitchen utensils, tiny pictures on the walls, and assorted objects ""borrowed"" for use as everyday tools.In an early scene, Arrietty and her father, Pod (Will Arnett), set out on a nighttime expedition to obtain needed supplies, specifically sugar and a single tissue.  This involves trekking through the innards of the house, climbing half-hammered nails, rappelling off kitchen counters, balancing on ledges, and negotiating slippery surfaces, all while making sure not to be detected by Beans or the rats that lurk close by.  This suspenseful scene illustrates the skills the little people have developed to survive.The film is a product of the Japanese studio of Hayao Miyazaki (""Spirited Away,"" ""Howl's Moving Castle""), released through Disney.  Every object is hand-drawn in 2D. It is visually striking, with outdoor scenes of gentle breezes wafting through high grasses and leaves, multi-colored flowers, and fluttering butterflies.  The human faces are less successfully rendered, as most have a neutral expression most of the time despite the level of emotion conveyed.  The major exception is Arrietty's mother, Homily (Amy Poehler), who gets to react in panic when she is discovered by Hara.The movie is like a tone poem.  It is rich in atmosphere, and the story doesn't always progress along an upbeat path.  This, too, might put off younger viewers who are used to anthropomorphic critters and wild chase sequences.  Here, the camera lingers on a look, an expression, a significant prop in order to underscore their importance and add resonance to scenes.  We're told that Shawn is about to undergo a heart operation.  Although we get little further information about him through overt actions, it's clear that he is lonely and concerned about the imminent medical procedure.  The scenes in which Shawn tries to become friends with Arrietty are presented gradually, tentatively, so that barriers between them have time to lessen.Rated G, ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" would best be enjoyed by youngsters from 8 to 11.

486994,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,779913027X,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[1, 2]","It doesn't take long to fall in love with The Secret World of Arrietty, the wondrous new animated film from Studio Ghibli. From the opening moments, we're thrust into a magical land right in front of our faces, which we'd all be able to see just by opening our eyes and taking a second look. Based on Mary Norton's influential children's book series, The Borrowers, the film was co-written by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, and his masterful fingerprints help make this one of the most delightful animated movies in years.Miyazaki has found yet another strong, unforgettable female heroine in Arrietty, an upbeat and adventurous 14 year old girl living with her parents: her stoic father, Pod; and her worrisome mother, Homily. Arrietty isn't that different from other teens her age, a little too headstrong for her own good, a touch too silly, but good hearted and loyal. There's just one major difference that separates Arrietty from other girls...she's approximately 10cm tall. Her entire family is, to be exact. They are part of a rapidly dwindling race known as Borrowers, tiny people who live in the nooks and crevasses of human households. They survive only by taking what they need and which won't be missed, a bar of soap, a cube of sugar, a piece of tissue paper. Through their ""waste not, want not"" outlook, the Borrowers are classic Miyazaki, whose films seamlessly blend humor, action, with a variety of eco-related themes.Arrietty yearns for her first ""borrowing"", but danger lurks with the arrival of a new human to the countryside home where they reside. Shawn is a sickly, sensitive boy staying with his aunt and her mischievous housekeeper to rest before major surgery. What he really wants is adventure, the kind that he's been forbidden to have but may never get the opportunity to experience. He finds what he's been looking for immediately upon arrival, catching what he thinks is a glimpse of Arrietty hiding amongst the flowers. Shawn had heard the stories for years from his mother, of the little people that lived beneath the floorboards. Shawn can't get them out of his head, and when he spots Arrietty and her father on a borrowing expedition, he only wants to be her friend. But to the Borrowers, humans are dangerous business. Arrietty's budding friendship with Shawn puts their entire family, possibly the last of their kind, at risk.Directed by Miyazaki's longtime animator,Hiromasa Yonebayashi, the titular ""secret world"" is one of amazing hand drawn detail and natural effects. The mundane to us becomes the stuff of legend to the Borrowers. A grasshopper becomes a monstrous enemy, a series of nails are stepping stones, and uncovering a pin needle is like discovering the sword Excalibur. We're treated first hand to the amazing perils the Borrowers face every day in the film's one big set piece, as Arrietty and Pod make a daring night time raid to gain the supplies that will sustain them for another year. The rest of the film proceeds along at a leisurely, comfortable pace, in the typical Studio Ghibli fashion.A few problems arise in the English translation, a common problem when it comes to imports like this. Amy Poehler is actually quite good as the constantly fretting Homily, but her husband Will Arnett's voice is a distraction as Pod. Sorry, we've heard him do that voice once too often on Arrested Development, so it's kind of hard to take it seriously now. The lush, crisp traditional animation makes it easy to forgive this minor issue.It's amazing how Miyazaki, even in just a co-writer role, can so completely adapt another person's work and make it his own. The Secret World of Arrietty is a visually arresting, magical look at humanity's double-edged effect on nature and it's myriad inhabitants, told with the care of a true genius.",4,Another Studio Ghibli masterpiece,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,3790,"[""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'fall', 'love', 'Secret', 'World', 'Arrietty', 'wondrous', 'new', 'animated', 'film', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'opening', 'moments', ""'re"", 'thrust', 'magical', 'land', 'right', 'front', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'just', 'opening', 'eyes', 'taking', 'second', 'look', 'Based', 'Mary', 'Norton', 'influential', 'children', 'book', 'series', 'Borrowers', 'film', 'was', 'co-written', 'legendary', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'masterful', 'fingerprints', 'help', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'delightful', 'animated', 'movies', 'years.Miyazaki', 'found', 'yet', 'strong', 'unforgettable', 'female', 'heroine', 'Arrietty', 'upbeat', 'adventurous', '14', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'living', 'parents', 'stoic', 'father', 'Pod', 'worrisome', 'mother', 'Homily', 'Arrietty', ""n't"", 'that', 'different', 'other', 'teens', 'age', 'little', 'too', 'headstrong', 'own', 'good', 'touch', 'too', 'silly', 'good', 'hearted', 'loyal', 'just', 'one', 'major', 'difference', 'Arrietty', 'other', 'girls', 'approximately', '10cm', 'tall', 'entire', 'family', 'be', 'exact', 'are', 'part', 'rapidly', 'dwindling', 'race', 'known', 'Borrowers', 'tiny', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'nooks', 'crevasses', 'human', 'households', 'survive', 'only', 'taking', 'what', 'need', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed', 'bar', 'soap', 'cube', 'sugar', 'piece', 'tissue', 'paper', 'waste', 'not', 'want', 'not', 'outlook', 'Borrowers', 'are', 'classic', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'seamlessly', 'blend', 'humor', 'action', 'variety', 'eco-related', 'themes.Arrietty', 'yearns', 'first', 'borrowing', 'danger', 'lurks', 'arrival', 'new', 'human', 'countryside', 'home', 'where', 'reside', 'Shawn', 'sickly', 'sensitive', 'boy', 'staying', 'aunt', 'mischievous', 'housekeeper', 'rest', 'major', 'surgery', 'What', 'really', 'adventure', 'kind', 'been', 'forbidden', 'have', 'may', 'never', 'get', 'opportunity', 'experience', 'what', 'been', 'looking', 'immediately', 'upon', 'arrival', 'catching', 'what', 'glimpse', 'Arrietty', 'hiding', 'amongst', 'flowers', 'Shawn', 'had', 'heard', 'stories', 'years', 'mother', 'little', 'people', 'lived', 'floorboards', 'Shawn', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'when', 'spots', 'Arrietty', 'father', 'borrowing', 'expedition', 'only', 'be', 'friend', 'Borrowers', 'humans', 'are', 'dangerous', 'business', 'Arrietty', 'budding', 'friendship', 'Shawn', 'puts', 'entire', 'family', 'possibly', 'last', 'kind', 'risk.Directed', 'Miyazaki', 'longtime', 'animator', 'Hiromasa', 'Yonebayashi', 'titular', 'secret', 'world', 'one', 'amazing', 'hand', 'drawn', 'detail', 'natural', 'effects', 'mundane', 'stuff', 'legend', 'Borrowers', 'grasshopper', 'monstrous', 'enemy', 'series', 'nails', 'are', 'stepping', 'stones', 'uncovering', 'pin', 'needle', 'discovering', 'sword', 'Excalibur', ""'re"", 'treated', 'first', 'hand', 'amazing', 'Borrowers', 'face', 'day', 'film', 'one', 'big', 'set', 'piece', 'Arrietty', 'Pod', 'make', 'daring', 'night', 'time', 'raid', 'gain', 'supplies', 'will', 'sustain', 'year', 'rest', 'film', 'proceeds', 'along', 'leisurely', 'comfortable', 'pace', 'typical', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'fashion.A', 'few', 'problems', 'arise', 'English', 'translation', 'common', 'problem', 'when', 'imports', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'constantly', 'fretting', 'Homily', 'husband', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'voice', 'distraction', 'Pod', 'Sorry', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'do', 'voice', 'once', 'too', 'often', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'kind', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'now', 'lush', 'crisp', 'traditional', 'animation', 'easy', 'forgive', 'minor', 'issue.It', 'amazing', 'how', 'Miyazaki', 'even', 'just', 'co-writer', 'role', 'can', 'so', 'completely', 'adapt', 'person', 'work', 'make', 'own', 'Secret', 'World', 'Arrietty', 'visually', 'arresting', 'magical', 'look', 'humanity', 'double-edged', 'effect', 'nature', 'myriad', 'inhabitants', 'told', 'care', 'true', 'genius']",The Secret World of Arrietty (Mandarin Chinese Edition)

I am saying this to establish that I'm not a hater, a huge fan if anything.I love the notion of new Ghibli movies but this is absurd. As I'm sure you already know, this story is a redone (and overdone) well known tale called The Borrowers. Normally remakes and reimaginations are something I am always up for but this a boring story with several already well done animations out there. It was great when I first read and later watched this story, at this point I think its tired.This was a complete waste of talent and lacks the unique and intriguing script of Studio Ghibli's previous masterpieces. Artwork and voice acting is great as usual, you're watching and hearing great talent parade around in plagiarism.If you are oblivious to the plot already, check it out, its quite unoriginal and hokey but you won't know!Go watch Nausica or Lupita again instead.",2,a complete cop out on Studio Ghibli's part,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,956,"['love', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'own', 'almost', 'films', 'upgrading', 'BD', 'are', 'released', 'am', 'saying', 'establish', ""'m"", 'not', 'hater', 'huge', 'fan', 'anything.I', 'love', 'notion', 'new', 'Ghibli', 'movies', 'absurd', ""'m"", 'sure', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'redone', 'overdone', 'well', 'known', 'tale', 'called', 'Borrowers', 'Normally', 'remakes', 'reimaginations', 'are', 'something', 'am', 'always', 'boring', 'story', 'several', 'already', 'well', 'done', 'animations', 'there', 'was', 'great', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'later', 'watched', 'story', 'point', 'think', 'tired.This', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'talent', 'unique', 'intriguing', 'script', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'previous', 'masterpieces', 'Artwork', 'voice', 'acting', 'great', 'usual', ""'re"", 'watching', 'hearing', 'great', 'talent', 'parade', 'plagiarism.If', 'are', 'oblivious', 'plot', 'already', 'check', 'out', 'quite', 'unoriginal', 'hokey', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'Go', 'watch', 'Nausica', 'Lupita', 'again', 'instead']",The Secret World of Arrietty (Mandarin Chinese Edition)
486999,AP1WE2DB14IL1,779913027X,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[3, 4]","The Secret World of Arrietty is the latest anime film from Japan's famous Studio Ghibli, the people whose creative talents have given us classic anime films like Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro.  The latter films were all directed by Hayao Miyazaki, who (along with Keiko Niwa) only served as screenwriter this time around.  First-time director Hiromasa Yonebayashi however did key work on the animation of a number of Miyazaki's films for over a decade and so stylistically there is a lot of similarity.The story is taken from Mary Norton's 1953 The Borrowers, the first of what became a very popular series of children's fantasy novels she wrote about a family of little four-inch high people called ""Borrowers"", who lived hidden away behind the walls and beneath the floorboards of houses of normal-sized human beings, whom Borrowers call ""Beans"".  Borrowers live by ""borrowing"" little things from the ""Beans"" and adapting them for their own use, but always being careful never to be seen, keeping their very existence secret.  The ""Beans"" of course notice now and then that some things around the house mysteriously go missing from time to time, but since the borrowers never take anything big or important, the beans just shrug it off as assume the things were simply lost or misplaced somehow.  There have been three or four movies based on The Borrowers series, but all of them were live-action films.  The Secret World of Arrietty is the first animated adaptation.The film begins with a twelve-year-old boy named Shawn (David Henrie) arriving at a house in the countryside where his great-aunt Jessica (Gracie Poletti) lives.  As he's getting out of the car, he sees a cat trying to catch something concealed in a shrub.  The cat is chased away by a crow before it can get whatever it's after, but then Shawn gets a glimpse of something extraordinary:  a four-inch high girl disappearing into the house through a cellar window with an armful of leaves she'd gathered.The girl is Arrietty (Bridgit Mendler), a fourteen-year-old Borrower who lives with her parents, Pod (Will Arnett) and Homily (Amy Poehler) in their tiny home hidden beneath the floorboards of Shawn's great-aunt's house.  Homily is upset to find out that Arrietty ventured outside the house on her own but is somewhat mollified when Arrietty gives her the bay and mint leaves that she brought back. Her father Pod, however, recognizes that Arrietty is not a child anymore. When Homily mentions that they're running out of sugar and tissue paper, Pod decides to have Arrietty accompany him that night, taking her on her first ""borrowing"" when he goes up into the house above to replenish the family's supply.  The mission to the kitchen, where they borrow a cube of sugar, comes off without incident, but when they go to the room where the tissue paper is kept, Arrietty suddenly finds herself spotted, the Bean boy Shawn staring directly at her.  So startled that she drops the sugar cube, Arrietty and Pod quickly retreat back into the walls, returning home empty-handed.  The next day, however, Arrietty is surprised - and then worried - to find the sugar cube along with a note from the Bean boy, waiting for her on the ledge of the cellar window.  Her curiosity about Shawn wars with her knowing that all Borrowers must keep their existence secret from all Beans.Things quickly become complicated when Arrietty ends up making contact with Shawn.  When her father finds out, he is determined that the family must find a new place to live because it's no longer safe for them to stay where a Bean knows of their existence.  To make matters worse, the house maid, Haru (Carol Burnett) has noticed odd things going on and discovers the Borrowers home beneath the floorboards, capturing Homily whom she puts into a glass jar.  Haru then calls some exterminators, determined to smoke the other Borrowers out of hiding and capture them as well.  It is up to Arrietty to rescue her mother and keep her family's secret existence from being exposed, and she is forced to turn to Shawn for help.The animation is, like all Studio Ghibli films, breathtakingly beautiful and highly detailed, and you really do get a feeling of what an ordinary house would feel like - and sound like - if you were a four-inch high Borrower exploring it.  The perspective of being in a world that was made for people many times your size is both breath-taking and intimidating at the same time, and the feeling is made quite palpable. The only criticism I have of The Secret World of Arrietty is that the pacing seemed quite slow at times.  I think that this is due to the fact that everything in Arrietty is familiar, and subsequently somewhat predictable as a result, in contrast to films like Spirited Away where you're constantly having unfamiliar things thrown at you and you never know what's going to happen or what you'll see next.Recommended for anyone who's an anime fan or a fan of the Borrowers series of children's novels.",4,A
