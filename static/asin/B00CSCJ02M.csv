1650661,A3R7PQAHD3NZM0,B00CSCJ02M,Autumn Blues Reviews,"[4, 4]","Ladies, if you are looking for a great double feature from the Hallmark collection I would highly recommend this DVD. This set includes two films ""The Sweeter Side of Life,"" and ""Meddling Mom."" I actually watched both these films with my husband and he liked them both. Although it was difficult for him to pick a favorite, both films were funny and just adorable, but my favorite of the two is The Sweeter Side of Life.In The Sweeter Side of Life you have Desiree Harper living in Manhattan with her husband who is a prestigious surgeon. Desiree lives a very comfortable life that includes shopping, primping, hanging with her girlfriends and she does it all with a credit card that has no limit. It doesn't take long in the movie before her husband comes home one day and tells her he wants a divorce. Immediately after, Desiree is left practically on the street has no alternative left then to go back home to live with her father in her home town in New Jersey. Desiree's father is a gentle giant who has his own bakery and soon Desiree finds herself working for her dad and later even finding love in the least and unexpected places. I found this film adorable and at times very moving, throughout this film I found myself totally engaged and forgetting my surroundings, feeling sorry for her, while laughing and cheered Desiree on. This is a great film, I would highly recommend for a ladies night and also for watching either with a significant other or by yourself while cuddling on the couch.In Meddling Mom you have Carmen Vega who with two beautiful daughters.  Although she has her daughters best interests in mind Carmen seems possessed in trying to control all aspects of their lives. Carmen not only sticks her nose into every situation involving her daughters, she is also intent on finding the perfect man for her daughter Ally. Ally has a great career and is not interested in dating or marriage but that does not stop Carmen and her best friends from trying to hook her up. The antics of Carmen are funny and a total invasion of privacy when it comes to her daughters and this movie left me wondering what I would do in this situation if my mother acted this way. In the end the tables are turned on Carmen and it is interesting to see her reaction. I found both these film to be a perfect fit for this combination DVD. Both films are funny, contain interesting situations, are unpredictable and entertaining and fit well into the Hallmark collection.",5,"A great double feature, highly entertaining with interesting and unpredictable situations.",1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,2470,"['Ladies', 'are', 'looking', 'great', 'double', 'feature', 'Hallmark', 'collection', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'two', 'films', 'Sweeter', 'Side', 'Life', 'Meddling', 'Mom', 'actually', 'watched', 'films', 'husband', 'liked', 'was', 'difficult', 'pick', 'favorite', 'films', 'were', 'funny', 'just', 'adorable', 'favorite', 'two', 'Sweeter', 'Side', 'Life.In', 'Sweeter', 'Side', 'Life', 'have', 'Desiree', 'Harper', 'living', 'Manhattan', 'husband', 'who', 'prestigious', 'surgeon', 'Desiree', 'very', 'comfortable', 'life', 'shopping', 'primping', 'hanging', 'girlfriends', 'credit', 'card', 'limit', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'movie', 'husband', 'home', 'one', 'day', 'divorce', 'Immediately', 'Desiree', 'left', 'practically', 'street', 'alternative', 'left', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'live', 'father', 'home', 'town', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Desiree', 'father', 'gentle', 'giant', 'who', 'own', 'bakery', 'soon', 'Desiree', 'working', 'dad', 'later', 'even', 'finding', 'love', 'least', 'unexpected', 'places', 'found', 'film', 'adorable', 'times', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'found', 'totally', 'engaged', 'forgetting', 'surroundings', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'laughing', 'cheered', 'Desiree', 'great', 'film', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'ladies', 'night', 'also', 'watching', 'significant', 'other', 'cuddling', 'couch.In', 'Meddling', 'Mom', 'have', 'Carmen', 'Vega', 'who', 'two', 'beautiful', 'daughters', 'daughters', 'best', 'interests', 'mind', 'Carmen', 'possessed', 'trying', 'control', 'aspects', 'lives', 'Carmen', 'not', 'only', 'nose', 'situation', 'involving', 'daughters', 'also', 'intent', 'finding', 'perfect', 'man', 'daughter', 'Ally', 'Ally', 'great', 'career', 'not', 'interested', 'dating', 'marriage', 'not', 'stop', 'Carmen', 'best', 'friends', 'trying', 'hook', 'up', 'antics', 'Carmen', 'are', 'funny', 'total', 'invasion', 'privacy', 'when', 'daughters', 'movie', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'situation', 'mother', 'acted', 'way', 'end', 'tables', 'are', 'turned', 'Carmen', 'interesting', 'see', 'reaction', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'perfect', 'fit', 'combination', 'DVD', 'films', 'are', 'funny', 'contain', 'interesting', 'situations', 'are', 'unpredictable', 'entertaining', 'fit', 'well', 'Hallmark', 'collection']",Hallmark Double Feature: Meddling Mom / Sweeter Side of Life

1650667,AY3EENC2BGTGK,B00CSCJ02M,"M. G. Gagliano ""Maria""","[0, 0]","The 411 by Maria:I love Hallmark movies! What I love about these is that they were not sappy at all. I never shed a tear and that my friends is a good thing. Once in a while it is just good to see a feel good movie about family, friends, love and rebuilding our lives that doesn't leave us heartbroken and sniffling into a tissue.Meddling Mom is an adorable movie about two Ally who is a successful architect and her family. Ally's sister is getting married and all the woman in her life assume that she is upset over this because it isn't her. She isn't upset in the least but her family and friends try to set her up with an adorable guy she wonders if he might be the one. Life gets complicated when she finds herself falling for Ben a co-worker on a project. Thankfully Ally is smart and knows how to handle herself. Everyone wins in this movie.I love the idea of the meddling mom. Never had one, hope to never be one but a mother's love runs deep and Ally's mom just wants the best for her.The characters are likable and I love the added side love story. You are never too old to fall in love.The Sweeter Side of Life finds Manhattan socialite Desiree suddenly a reluctant free woman. When she ends up injured her father is there to rescue her and help her put her life back together although not where she expects to be; in a small bakery shop in Flemington, New Jersey.Dad's business is suffering although Desiree would never know it. He is a happy, loveable, jolly man sweetly played by James Best (Roscoe from The Dukes of Hazzard. I loved that show!)  Desiree gets a wake up call from a friend and plans to help her father's business.With the help of her lawyer, a new love interest and the college education her parents paid for, Desiree finds herself living the sweet life!What a cute movie. I loved how they didn't spend a lot of time on the bitterness of divorce or have Desiree feel like she couldn't move or breathe without her husband, money and life. I appreciated all the secondary characters and what they added and hello, Alastair MacKenzie, where have you been all my life?!",4,Wonderful Stories About Family and Life,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,2096,"['411', 'Maria', 'love', 'Hallmark', 'movies', 'What', 'love', 'were', 'not', 'sappy', 'never', 'shed', 'tear', 'friends', 'good', 'thing', 'Once', 'while', 'just', 'good', 'see', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'family', 'friends', 'love', 'rebuilding', 'lives', ""n't"", 'leave', 'heartbroken', 'sniffling', 'tissue.Meddling', 'Mom', 'adorable', 'movie', 'two', 'Ally', 'who', 'successful', 'architect', 'family', 'Ally', 'sister', 'getting', 'married', 'woman', 'life', 'assume', 'upset', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'upset', 'least', 'family', 'friends', 'try', 'set', 'up', 'adorable', 'guy', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'Life', 'complicated', 'when', 'falling', 'Ben', 'co-worker', 'project', 'Thankfully', 'Ally', 'smart', 'how', 'handle', 'Everyone', 'movie.I', 'love', 'idea', 'meddling', 'mom', 'Never', 'had', 'one', 'hope', 'never', 'be', 'one', 'mother', 'love', 'deep', 'Ally', 'mom', 'just', 'best', 'her.The', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'love', 'added', 'side', 'story', 'are', 'never', 'too', 'old', 'fall', 'love.The', 'Sweeter', 'Side', 'Life', 'Manhattan', 'socialite', 'Desiree', 'suddenly', 'reluctant', 'free', 'woman', 'When', 'up', 'injured', 'father', 'there', 'rescue', 'help', 'put', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'not', 'where', 'be', 'small', 'bakery', 'shop', 'Flemington', 'New', 'Jersey.Dad', 'business', 'suffering', 'Desiree', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'happy', 'loveable', 'jolly', 'man', 'sweetly', 'played', 'James', 'Best', 'Roscoe', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'loved', 'show', 'Desiree', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'friend', 'plans', 'help', 'father', 'business.With', 'help', 'lawyer', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'college', 'education', 'parents', 'paid', 'Desiree', 'living', 'sweet', 'life', 'What', 'cute', 'movie', 'loved', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'bitterness', 'divorce', 'have', 'Desiree', 'feel', 'could', ""n't"", 'move', 'breathe', 'husband', 'money', 'life', 'appreciated', 'secondary', 'characters', 'what', 'added', 'hello', 'Alastair', 'MacKenzie', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'life']",Hallmark Double Feature: Meddling Mom / Sweeter Side of Life

1650669,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B00CSCJ02M,mk,"[7, 7]","Gaiam released, Dove approved, Hallmark Channel movies offer a mixed bag of entertaining family affairs and romance.Meddling Mom, my least favorite, has Sonia Braga, an actor I've enjoyed over the years, playing the controlling and meddling mom trying to set-up her daughter with the right man and right life.It's lightweight, and I found it dull and dragging, the humor not funny or clever, in general.  It's not totally bad, but my wife and I ended up wanting to hurry through it to get to the other movie.  It does feature romance, mild and predictable family drama, and a Hallmark ending.  It features a cultural aspect which they simply don't develop and promote- they talk with a slight accent, say a few Spanish words and play some Latin music in the background at times.The Sweeter Side of Life presents Kathryn Morris as a very unlikable, spoiled, married to a rich doctor, city dweller who loses her fancy lifestyle when hubby dumps her for a younger woman.  The dumpee moves back to small town New Jersey to live and help out with her loving widowed dad at his cute bakery.It's small town life vs. big city and corporate America.  We've seen this all done before; however, the heroine's transformation, the fun and folksy type characters she meets, and a cute plus funny budding romance takes this flick to another level that's quite enjoyable.For me, I'd stick with just the Sweeter Side, or, if you want, just forget my review, and for a few dollars more buy the double feature.  Both movies Hallmark clean, but children will probably find them quite boring due to adult themes and not enough animals or kids.",3,"One Sweeter and Good, One So-So in Need of Some Meddling",1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,1622,"['Gaiam', 'released', 'Dove', 'approved', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'movies', 'offer', 'mixed', 'bag', 'entertaining', 'family', 'affairs', 'romance.Meddling', 'Mom', 'least', 'favorite', 'Sonia', 'Braga', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'years', 'playing', 'controlling', 'meddling', 'mom', 'trying', 'set-up', 'daughter', 'right', 'man', 'right', 'life.It', 'lightweight', 'found', 'dull', 'dragging', 'humor', 'not', 'funny', 'clever', 'general', 'not', 'totally', 'bad', 'wife', 'ended', 'up', 'wanting', 'hurry', 'get', 'other', 'movie', 'feature', 'romance', 'mild', 'predictable', 'family', 'drama', 'Hallmark', 'ending', 'cultural', 'aspect', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'develop', 'promote-', 'talk', 'slight', 'accent', 'say', 'few', 'Spanish', 'words', 'play', 'Latin', 'music', 'background', 'times.The', 'Sweeter', 'Side', 'Life', 'presents', 'Kathryn', 'Morris', 'very', 'unlikable', 'spoiled', 'married', 'rich', 'doctor', 'city', 'dweller', 'who', 'fancy', 'lifestyle', 'when', 'hubby', 'younger', 'woman', 'dumpee', 'back', 'small', 'town', 'New', 'Jersey', 'live', 'help', 'out', 'loving', 'widowed', 'dad', 'cute', 'bakery.It', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'vs.', 'big', 'city', 'corporate', 'America', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'however', 'heroine', 'transformation', 'fun', 'folksy', 'type', 'characters', 'cute', 'funny', 'budding', 'romance', 'flick', 'level', 'quite', 'enjoyable.For', ""'d"", 'stick', 'just', 'Sweeter', 'Side', 'want', 'just', 'forget', 'review', 'few', 'dollars', 'more', 'buy', 'double', 'feature', 'movies', 'Hallmark', 'clean', 'children', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'quite', 'boring', 'due', 'adult', 'themes', 'not', 'enough', 'animals', 'kids']",Hallmark Double Feature: Meddling Mom / Sweeter Side of Life
