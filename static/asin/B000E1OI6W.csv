It IS hilarious, in his usual uncompromising way, and definitely left me wanting more.  One nice addition on the DVD, though, is a pretty good ""Behind the Scenes"" bonus feature on which he talks about how he came to be a stand-up comedian.  It's not as good as the stand-up, but it's fun to see.I was also happy to see that the material is 99% new.  My wife and I both love the ""Drunk in Public,"" ""They Call Me Tater Salad,"" and ""All The Way to the Crash Site"" stories, and other stuff, but it's good to see newer material that hasn't been played to death on cable yet.  ""Squirrel Man"" is a great addition, as is the title bit.If you're unfamiliar with Ron White, I suggest you check out some of his earlier stuff BEFORE buying or renting this DVD.  He tends to make fun of his own life, friends, and family A LOT in his act, so you'll understand more of his references if you come to it having seen the earlier stuff.

He never strains (as many comedians do), he's never frantic, and he sets up everything beautifully.  He's very coherent as well, which leads me to believe that he may not be drinking Scotch on stage.  But he has a rep as a hard drinkin' man, so he has to keep up appearances, I suppose.  Ron is definitely the best of the blue collar bunch.  Foxworthy is OK, I'm not really familiar with Engvall, and I can't stand Larry the Cable Guy.  I've watched it twice, and it holds up both times.  Much comedy dates immediately now, but this stuff doesn't.  And I love the ""Tater Salad"" story, which I believe to be absolutely true.

Jeff Foxworthy said on one of the 'Blue Collar Comedy Tour' shows that the best and funniest material the comedians get is from the things that happen to them in real life. Several of Ron White's real life stories here are so similar to things in our own day to day lives that not only can we relate, but his way of telling the stories, with his delivery, quickness, and ohh some of those faces he makes tie this all together into one major non-stop laugh-fest that you'll still laugh about days later thinking about some of the stories. This is very much ADULT comedy and the jokes get a bit more and more adult as it goes on. Even though adult language isn't a 'big hit' with me, Ron's way of telling the stories has every naughty word in 'just the right places' to where you'll totally be splitting a gut laughing. Be careful if you watch this DVD late at night though, as you'll surely wake up your household laughing so loudly!As funny as this DVD is non-stop, there is a small bit where Ron tells about how he along with Jeff Foxworthy, Larry the Cable Guy, and Bill Engvall all visited our severely injured troops at the Walter Reed Medical Center in D.C. that brought me to tears for a minute, but the laughter came roaring right back.

He comes off more like a nasty, rich, burn-out these days. And while raunch doesn't make me squeamish at all if it's clever or truly funny, I can state without a doubt that there are plenty of ""tried and true Texans"" who do not care for Ron White's kind of humor and never did.Furthermore, as a fourth-generation Texan from a six-generation Texas family I have to say old Fuzz ain't got a clue what he's talking about. You would be hard-pressed to find a car with ""longhorn cattle horns"" anyplace but a custom auto museum these days...and very few beehive hairdos. I have my suspicions that old Fuzz ain't even a Texan at all; he yaps about Texas cliches that are straight out of Hollywood more than the real Lone Star State. The ""Fuzziest"" notion is that anybody would presume to speak for the Texas sense of humor with such tired generalizations, muchless equate it all with a trailer trash sensibility when this great state was built by a lot of tough pioneers who would have booted the likes of Ron White out in the street if he ran his mouth in such a manner in mixed company or behaved publicly the way Ron White brags about. Left up to the likes of him, there would never have been a Texas because he would have had to suffer too much and display too much true character.I'm not saying that Ron White has not been extremely funny at times or that I never belly laugh at his observations or tone. But his is nothing more or less than raunchy adult nightclub humor with a twang--not something that is a synonym for anything purely ""Texan"".I would just add that his tale of how he behaved toward the parking lot attendant speaks volumes about Ron White's current state. There was a time when that attendant would have been Ron White, and there's little doubt---based upon his own past testimony--that he also would have been sleeping on the job and belligerent on the job.
