However, my girlfriend, nothing like me, found it innane and stupid.The film manages to deliver a few laughs and lots of cheese, all of which make for an entertaining movie. And really, that is the key to this one. You will be telling yourself while watching this that everything about it sucks, the plot is unbelievable, if not predictable, the acting, well for what it is the acting isn't bad, and there is a total lack of real character development. However, these shortcomings will quickly fade away as you find yourself enjoying this one in spite of your own inner critic.On the whole it is fun to watch, not just once, but even multiple times. And in the end, even for all its flaws, it ends up being a cute and fun flick.",3,"Very cheesy, but entertaining nonetheless",1088812800,"07 3, 2004",2004,838,"['Being', 'somewhat', 'geek', 'myself', 'former', 'resident', 'silicon', 'valley', 'movie', 'immediately', 'appealed', 'However', 'girlfriend', 'nothing', 'found', 'innane', 'stupid.The', 'film', 'manages', 'deliver', 'few', 'laughs', 'lots', 'cheese', 'make', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'really', 'key', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'telling', 'watching', 'everything', 'plot', 'unbelievable', 'not', 'predictable', 'acting', 'well', 'what', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'total', 'lack', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'However', 'shortcomings', 'will', 'quickly', 'fade', 'away', 'find', 'enjoying', 'one', 'spite', 'own', 'inner', 'critic.On', 'whole', 'fun', 'watch', 'not', 'just', 'once', 'even', 'multiple', 'times', 'end', 'even', 'flaws', 'up', 'being', 'cute', 'fun', 'flick']",N/A

Still, it's actually quite funny. A young marketing guru joins a tech startup and forms a team of geeks and dweebs in order to try to build a $99 laptop. What makes the film funny is how eccentric some of the characters are. I especially like Tiny, the overweight pervert. He just has some great timing. It's not the funniest plot ever, but it is entertaining.",4,Funny family movie,1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,496,"['can', 'guess', 'why', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'theaters', 'designed', 'chick', 'flick', 'stars', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'guys', 'Still', 'actually', 'quite', 'funny', 'young', 'marketing', 'guru', 'tech', 'startup', 'team', 'geeks', 'dweebs', 'order', 'try', 'build', '99', 'laptop', 'What', 'film', 'funny', 'how', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'are', 'especially', 'Tiny', 'overweight', 'pervert', 'just', 'great', 'timing', 'not', 'funniest', 'plot', 'ever', 'entertaining']",N/A
