464743,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305428484,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 6]","I'll just say right now that I know this movie is preposterous.  In fact this movie is technically terrible.  The script is weak, very weak.  The dialog is ridiculous and inane.  The performances are over-the-top and resemble that of a cheap adult film (this film in general feels like a cheap adult film) but in all its cheesy deliciousness I can't help but adore this movie.  Sure, I only gave it two stars, but those two stars are seriously heartfelt.The storyline is retarded (is that politically correct) but I'll give you the run down just for kicks.  Psychiatrist Bill Capa goes color blind after a patient of his commits suicide in front of him and so, obviously under emotional distress, he travels to LA to visit with a friend and fellow psychiatrist.  When his friend is murdered Bill decides to take over his therapy group (not to mention living in the man's house).  Little does he know that this group, as well as a mysterious woman who walks (drives) into his life may all have connections to the death of his friend.  As he gets closer to uncovering them his life is put in extreme danger.Bruce Willis is not one known for doing films like this.  He's the action guy (there are some action scenes here, but they are dense), right?  Well, he dumbs it down a little here as Bill, but his performance is sincere even if it is weak.  Jane March (who is actually an actress in the adult film industry) is horrible as Rose, the mysterious girl who engages in countless lustful acts with Bill.  They make an attractive couple (and Bruce is not afraid to let himself swing free) and their love scenes are highlights of the film (they are the only scenes that are not diluted with preposterous dialog) but their steamy chemistry is not enough to save the film from being nothing more than a guilty (yes I'm guilty) pleasure.The supporting players are not any better here.  Lesley Ann Warren is extremely over-the-top in a way that makes me wonder how she ever got into acting in the first place, and Ruben Blades is ridiculous; utterly ridiculous.  The entire lot of patients are clich&eacute;d and annoying.As the film draws to its close the plot twists begin to get more and more convoluted and implausible and the ending is above and beyond ridiculous.  The fact remains that this film is D-Grade at best and really has no purpose other than to include gratuitous nudity and violence into a mainstream film.  See it for the skin (there are ample amounts from both Willis and March) and enjoy it for all it's absurdity.  Don't expect something smart or connective but sometimes it's nice to turn off your brain and indulge in something `trashy'.",2,Truthfully it's a terrible movie; but I can't help but enjoy it...,1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,2654,"[""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'right', 'now', 'know', 'movie', 'preposterous', 'fact', 'movie', 'technically', 'terrible', 'script', 'weak', 'very', 'weak', 'dialog', 'ridiculous', 'inane', 'performances', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'resemble', 'cheap', 'adult', 'film', 'film', 'general', 'feels', 'cheap', 'adult', 'film', 'cheesy', 'deliciousness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'adore', 'movie', 'Sure', 'only', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'seriously', 'heartfelt.The', 'storyline', 'retarded', 'politically', 'correct', ""'ll"", 'give', 'run', 'down', 'just', 'kicks', 'Psychiatrist', 'Bill', 'Capa', 'color', 'blind', 'patient', 'commits', 'suicide', 'front', 'so', 'obviously', 'emotional', 'distress', 'LA', 'visit', 'friend', 'fellow', 'psychiatrist', 'When', 'friend', 'murdered', 'Bill', 'take', 'over', 'therapy', 'group', 'not', 'mention', 'living', 'man', 'house', 'Little', 'know', 'group', 'as', 'well', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'who', 'drives', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'connections', 'death', 'friend', 'closer', 'uncovering', 'life', 'put', 'extreme', 'danger.Bruce', 'Willis', 'not', 'one', 'known', 'doing', 'films', 'action', 'guy', 'are', 'action', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'dense', 'right', 'Well', 'down', 'little', 'here', 'Bill', 'performance', 'sincere', 'even', 'weak', 'Jane', 'March', 'who', 'actually', 'actress', 'adult', 'film', 'industry', 'horrible', 'Rose', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'who', 'countless', 'lustful', 'acts', 'Bill', 'make', 'attractive', 'couple', 'Bruce', 'not', 'afraid', 'let', 'swing', 'free', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'highlights', 'film', 'are', 'only', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'diluted', 'preposterous', 'dialog', 'steamy', 'chemistry', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'film', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'guilty', 'yes', ""'m"", 'guilty', 'pleasure.The', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'not', 'better', 'here', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'extremely', 'over-the-top', 'way', 'wonder', 'how', 'ever', 'got', 'acting', 'first', 'place', 'Ruben', 'Blades', 'ridiculous', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'entire', 'lot', 'patients', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'annoying.As', 'film', 'close', 'plot', 'begin', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'convoluted', 'implausible', 'ending', 'ridiculous', 'fact', 'film', 'D-Grade', 'best', 'really', 'purpose', 'other', 'include', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'violence', 'mainstream', 'film', 'See', 'skin', 'are', 'ample', 'amounts', 'Willis', 'March', 'enjoy', 'absurdity', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'something', 'smart', 'connective', 'nice', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'indulge', 'something', 'trashy']",N/A

For me, I used to think that it was both a good and a bad film, leaning towards to the latter. I believe it's because of how unsatisfying the conclusion was after so much work put into the unfolding of the mystery. I typically regard Bruce Willis as a poor actor, but in Color of Night, it's among his best works. I actually like the story a lot, and I view Color of Night in a better light now. I think time has been kind to it. One thing I find the film disappointing is how apparent the dissimulation was. All I had to do is to look at the set of teeth of one person. And that's all there is to it. I'll bet Demi Moore blew fuse when she first saw Bruce Willis getting it on hot and heavy with Jane March (I mistook her for Shawnee Smith) and then sought revenge through silly pictures such as Striptease and Disclosure. Bruce seems to have enjoyed the experience. I wonder why Jane March hasn't appeared in films very much after that. The all-star cast helps a lot to keep Color of Night afloat. Notice at the end of the film where Bruce and Rose climb to the top of a tower and the background shows maybe one mile above of the freeway as if this is really the scene of Batman with Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger. Another thing I am curious, if Ritchie had a drug abuse problem and was sent to jail, I think there might be a point during the process that he would have to strip naked. Therefore, the gender will be revealed. Now, I see that Maxim magazine thought Color of Night had the best sex scenes. Oy vey...what a nescience. Without a question, that distinction goes to Don't Look Now. Meanwhile, I don't think the group therapy sessions were of any use. I think that nobody resolved a damn thing. It makes me to wonder what's the ongoing rate for this crap.

464746,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6305428484,calvinnme,"[0, 2]","This movie won the Razzie award for Worst Motion Picture of 1994. Oddly enough though, it didn't win in any of the other ""worst of"" categories. This really says something about the film. The fact is, it is just hard to point to any one or even combination of factors of why it is so bad. It's not that any one particular performance is bad or an actor or actress is miscast or that there is particularly cheesy dialogue as is so often the case in a ""bad film"".  It's just that the whole thing comes together to form a whole lot of nothing. It's more what isn't in the film than what is in it that makes it mediocre. Sure, the ending is unexpected, but it would also be unexpected if I found an extra broom when I was cleaning out my closet. That wouldn't make it remarkable, interesting, or even noteworthy. Because I never grew to care about the characters I couldn't be expected to care about the ending. The film is trying to be a psychological thriller with Willis as the protagonist trying to unravel the mystery. What comes out over the duration of the film are just many seemingly disjointed odd events meant to shock but just don't form any kind of cohesive plot. Instead we have what could have been a strong cast of characters in good performances spending the whole film trying to figure out exactly who they are supposed to be.

464753,A3GLALCBHOR3T,6305428484,Harry Georgatos,"[0, 0]","This film has the notiriety as Paul Verhoeven's SHOWGIRLS. Director Richard Rush movie is probaly the closests sensibility I've seen to the films of Brian DePalma. DePalma's specialty is Hitchcokian type thrillers dealing with pyschiatric disorders in a very lurid pulp-fiction manner with films such as SISTERS, OBSESSION, DRESSED TO KILL, BODY DOUBLE and RAISING CAIN. Rush's THE COLOR OF NIGHT falls into that genre. A lot of the visual techniques Rush employs is very Hitchcock/DePalma from the use of the split focus diopter lens to the use of the color red which is a personal obsession of DePalma films, and the use of sleazy sex and disguises one would find in Hitchcock and DePalma.The story starts off in New York in a prestigious pyschiatric practice with Bruce Willis seeing to a patient who commits suicide by jumping out of the window of his highrise building. This opening set-piece for me was the best part of the film in the way it is visually planned by Rush. Willis then heads off to El Lay where he stays with a collegue in his state-of-the-art mansion.

They should take a gander at Willis in this l994 nail-biter. He's never looked more sizzling, sexy and gorgeous as a psychologist trying to track down a serial killer--who might be one of his own patients.Willis proves what a terrific movie star he is when the camera photographs just his face--and just using his eyes, facial expression and mouth he conveys volumes of emotions--from blazing sexualty to pathos to bitterness.Some reviewers say that this DVD has full frontal shots of Willis naked but in the version I just watched, you barely see his nude tush and just a bare glimpse of a very partial front glimpse of genitalia.Which brings me the point to this case of blatant  gende bias: Jane March is very nude in several scenes--but Willis is always covered up with not even a rear shot.

464756,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6305428484,JGC,"[2, 2]","As a huge (and very new) Bruce Willis fan I had to watch this movie as it has gone down in history as being one of his most (in)famous roles ever. In this film Bruce is a group therapist on a quest to find a macabre killer who he suspects is a patient. Along the way he meets a trampy young girl (the very talented Jane March) that only manages to complicate matters.The overall story and the pace of the movie (after the first 35 minutes which moved like sand in an hourglass) was very strong. I enjoyed learning about all of the members of the group. They were all a bunch of oddballs. It's hard to say which was the most screwed up or who had the most issues.Ritchie was the most interesting to watch because although he was the youngest member of the group it was fairly apparent that he had been through something very shocking. Although she wasn't a member of the group sessions, I also thought that Bonnie added a lot to the overall story. Even though she was only in a couple of short scenes she somehow still always managed to pull the rug out from under Sondra.The movie ends with a surprise that no one could have seen coming because even though the story built up to it the ending still managed to remain a total surprise. Bruce was just fine in this movie, however I thought that perhaps his talents were a touch overused and overstated. Perhaps he would have been better suited as the police detective.I did think the movie was a little on the long side (over 2 hours). The love making and nudity was also rather excessive. Frankly, I do not want to see my movie stars undress because it leaves nothing to the imagination. It's also rather anticlimactic and just boring to watch. The DVD does not include anything besides the trailer. The lightening, picture quality and overall sound leaves a lot to be desired.Overall I give this movie 4.5 stars.

464763,A2YQ5O6XV23543,6305428484,Kevin H. Dudley,"[9, 13]","Back in the early 90's, Jane March made a big splash internationally with her uninhibited performance in the sexually explicit The Lover. Granted, the role didn't give her much to work with, but from a physical standpoint she made a big impression on a lot of filmgoers, including me. The movie garnered her a lot of notoriety and she had every opportunity to use that as a spring-board into a legitimate movie career. Unfortunately, choosing the unbelievably stupid Bruce Willis vehicle Color of Night as her follow-up probably killed any chance at a career that she had.I've always found erotic thrillers to be quite a dubious genre. Most of the ones that I've seen, while sexually explicit, aren't really erotic. Nor are they thrilling in any way. This movie was following on the heals of the tremendous success of Basic Instinct and almost every studio was chomping at the bit to come out with something similar. As a result we ended up with some terrible films like Sliver, Jade, Body of Evidence and this film, Color of Night.The plot goes something like this. Bruce Willis is a psychiatrist who has a patient dive out of his office window, going splat on the sidewalk below. He is so traumatized by the incident that he loses the ability to see the color red(!). He decides to take a break by visiting his psychiatrist friend played by Scott Bakula and hanging out with Scott's therapy group. He hopes that he might be able to make some sense as to what has happened. Scott's group is a motley crew of screwed up people, from a woman who is nymphomaniac, to a weird androgynous young boy. Bruce ends up meeting a beautiful young woman played by the delectable Jane March and he quickly falls in love with her. We get treated to explicit scenes of the two of them screwing in the pool, the bedroom, the bathtub and the shower. Meanwhile someone murders Scott Bakula and starts to wreck havoc with Bruce. He tries to figure out if it's someone in Scott's therapy group and on and on and so forth.The movie is really quite laughable due to the fact of how serious Bruce Willis was apparently taking this movie. Virtually everyone else in the movie seems to have their tongue planted in their cheeks with their performances, but Bruce seemed to think that this might be an Oscar contender. Add to the fact that the plot is absolutely atrocious and contrived beyond comprehension, and add way too many red herrings, and the movie quickly becomes a chore to watch.About the only thing this movie really had going for it was the explicit, but decidedly unerotic sex scenes. They really come across as more silly than anything else.The only thing that I enjoyed was getting to see a slightly older Jane March in the buff and looking better than ever. What a smoking body!But, like I mentioned before, she got a lot of the blame along with Bruce as to why the movie turned out so terrible and as a result, she has appeared in very few movies since. I still think that if she had been given the proper chance, she could have been a great actress, but people have all but forgotten about her by now.It's really surprising that this movie didn't kill Bruce Willis' career. But I guess if he could survive Hudson Hawk & Bonfire of the Vanities, he could survive anything.BTW, the version I watched was listed as being the ""R-rated director's cut"" with 17 additional ""steamy"" minutes added back into the film. Since I never saw the original cut I couldn't tell what might have been added back into this version. There is some fairly explicit sexual content and a shot of full frontal Bruce Willis nudity in the pool scene but nothing that's too strong.Avoid this movie like it was herpes.Color of Night is rated R and contains strong sexual content, nudity, graphic violence and strong language.",1,One of the dumbest movies that I've ever seen.,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,3788,"['Back', 'early', '90', 'Jane', 'March', 'made', 'big', 'splash', 'internationally', 'uninhibited', 'performance', 'sexually', 'Lover', 'Granted', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'work', 'physical', 'standpoint', 'made', 'big', 'impression', 'lot', 'filmgoers', 'including', 'movie', 'garnered', 'lot', 'notoriety', 'had', 'opportunity', 'use', 'spring-board', 'legitimate', 'movie', 'career', 'Unfortunately', 'choosing', 'unbelievably', 'stupid', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'vehicle', 'Color', 'Night', 'follow-up', 'probably', 'killed', 'chance', 'career', 'had.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'erotic', 'thrillers', 'be', 'quite', 'dubious', 'genre', 'Most', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'erotic', 'are', 'thrilling', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'following', 'heals', 'tremendous', 'success', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'almost', 'studio', 'was', 'chomping', 'bit', 'come', 'out', 'something', 'similar', 'result', 'ended', 'up', 'terrible', 'films', 'Sliver', 'Jade', 'Body', 'Evidence', 'film', 'Color', 'Night.The', 'plot', 'something', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'patient', 'dive', 'office', 'window', 'going', 'splat', 'sidewalk', 'so', 'traumatized', 'incident', 'ability', 'see', 'color', 'red', 'take', 'break', 'visiting', 'psychiatrist', 'friend', 'played', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'hanging', 'out', 'Scott', 'therapy', 'group', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'happened', 'Scott', 'group', 'motley', 'crew', 'screwed', 'people', 'woman', 'who', 'nymphomaniac', 'weird', 'androgynous', 'young', 'boy', 'Bruce', 'up', 'meeting', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'played', 'delectable', 'Jane', 'March', 'quickly', 'love', 'get', 'treated', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'two', 'screwing', 'pool', 'bedroom', 'bathtub', 'shower', 'Meanwhile', 'someone', 'murders', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'Bruce', 'figure', 'out', 'someone', 'Scott', 'therapy', 'group', 'so', 'forth.The', 'movie', 'really', 'quite', 'laughable', 'due', 'fact', 'how', 'serious', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'was', 'apparently', 'taking', 'movie', 'Virtually', 'everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'have', 'tongue', 'planted', 'cheeks', 'performances', 'Bruce', 'seemed', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'Add', 'fact', 'plot', 'absolutely', 'atrocious', 'contrived', 'comprehension', 'add', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'red', 'herrings', 'movie', 'quickly', 'chore', 'watch.About', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'really', 'had', 'going', 'was', 'explicit', 'decidedly', 'unerotic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'really', 'come', 'more', 'silly', 'anything', 'else.The', 'only', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'getting', 'see', 'slightly', 'older', 'Jane', 'March', 'buff', 'looking', 'better', 'ever', 'What', 'smoking', 'body', 'mentioned', 'got', 'lot', 'blame', 'Bruce', 'why', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'so', 'terrible', 'result', 'appeared', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'still', 'think', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'proper', 'chance', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'actress', 'people', 'have', 'forgotten', 'now.It', 'really', 'surprising', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'career', 'guess', 'could', 'survive', 'Hudson', 'Hawk', 'Bonfire', 'Vanities', 'could', 'survive', 'anything.BTW', 'version', 'watched', 'was', 'listed', 'being', 'R-rated', 'director', 'cut', '17', 'additional', 'steamy', 'minutes', 'added', 'back', 'film', 'never', 'saw', 'original', 'cut', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'back', 'version', 'fairly', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'content', 'shot', 'full', 'frontal', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'nudity', 'pool', 'scene', 'nothing', 'too', 'strong.Avoid', 'movie', 'was', 'herpes.Color', 'Night', 'rated', 'R', 'strong', 'sexual', 'content', 'nudity', 'graphic', 'violence', 'strong', 'language']",N/A

Surely, the plot that revolves around a psychologist and his psycho patient,which is usually the standard plot for most erotic thrillers, is not enough to stimulate the interest of any movie lover.And this is exactly why this DVD version has in big bold letters,the 'exclusive 15 minutes extra hot scenes', too daring to be shown in theatres!! And this is why I am writing this review to draw your attention to the following:It is a marketing gimmick that yet again I dive straight into, only to be disappointed! (but I am learning!)Well, yes, there are some extra 'bits and pieces' added that are not quite as daring as you might be lead to believe, and in comparison to any French or Spanish films of late,it looks quite tame.And yes, included is the lesbian scene between March and Warren which was cut in its entirety for the theatre release.(a quite talked about scene at the time,like as rumours have it the still lost girl-girl scenes of Basic Instinct alledgedly also cut).Now a word about this scene:(if it can be properly described as scene)Why it was cut in the first place is a great mystery! and another riddle yet to be solved into the strange workings of censor's mind!It is the tamest and most ridiculous girl-girl kiss I have ever seen..Russian leaders used to kiss each other and some unsuspected poor international visitors for longer and more passionately! and it was filmed for all to see!!If you expect action similar to Bound, A Girl Thing or Monkey's Mask then think again!And think twice before buying this DVD,if you find the lure of the 'extra hot' too tempting ..If you like Bruce Willis and enjoyed the film, then fine, but just beware of the marketing 'beast' that might very well disappoint you as much as I was.",2,Don't Believe The Extra Hype,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,2531,"['First', 'would', 'like', 'stress', 'think', 'am', 'minority', 'here', 'Color', 'Night', 'awful', 'movie', 'more', 'so', 'very', 'talented', 'actors', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'Eriq', 'La', 'Salle', 'are', 'it.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'bearable', 'had', 'unknown', 'B', 'actors', 'been', 'involved', 'instead', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'appeal', 'A', 'list', 'names', 'Color', 'Night', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'exactly', 'same', 'hundreds', 'other', 'films', 'genre', 'video', 'DVD', 'market.Of', 'course', 'only', 'reason', 'filmed', 'gained', 'controversy', 'time', 'release', 'indeed', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'first', 'place', 'sex', 'scenes..and', 'infamous', 'ones', 'Willis', 'other', 'talents', 'exposed', 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'Jane', 'March', 'Surely', 'plot', 'psychologist', 'psycho', 'patient', 'usually', 'standard', 'plot', 'most', 'erotic', 'thrillers', 'not', 'enough', 'stimulate', 'interest', 'movie', 'lover.And', 'exactly', 'why', 'DVD', 'version', 'big', 'bold', 'letters', ""'exclusive"", '15', 'minutes', 'extra', 'hot', 'scenes', 'too', 'daring', 'be', 'shown', 'theatres', 'why', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'draw', 'attention', 'following', 'marketing', 'gimmick', 'yet', 'again', 'dive', 'straight', 'only', 'be', 'disappointed', 'am', 'learning', 'Well', 'yes', 'are', 'extra', ""'bits"", 'pieces', 'added', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'daring', 'might', 'be', 'lead', 'believe', 'comparison', 'French', 'Spanish', 'films', 'late', 'quite', 'tame.And', 'yes', 'included', 'lesbian', 'scene', 'March', 'Warren', 'was', 'cut', 'entirety', 'theatre', 'release', 'quite', 'talked', 'scene', 'time', 'rumours', 'have', 'still', 'lost', 'girl-girl', 'scenes', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'alledgedly', 'also', 'cut', '.Now', 'word', 'scene', 'can', 'be', 'properly', 'described', 'scene', 'Why', 'was', 'cut', 'first', 'place', 'great', 'mystery', 'riddle', 'yet', 'be', 'solved', 'strange', 'workings', 'censor', 'mind', 'tamest', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'girl-girl', 'kiss', 'have', 'ever', 'seen..Russian', 'leaders', 'used', 'kiss', 'other', 'unsuspected', 'poor', 'international', 'visitors', 'longer', 'more', 'passionately', 'was', 'filmed', 'see', 'expect', 'action', 'similar', 'Bound', 'A', 'Girl', 'Thing', 'Monkey', 'Mask', 'then', 'think', 'again', 'think', 'twice', 'buying', 'DVD', 'find', 'lure', ""'extra"", 'hot', 'too', 'tempting', '..If', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'then', 'fine', 'just', 'beware', 'marketing', ""'beast"", 'might', 'very', 'well', 'disappoint', 'as', 'much', 'was']",N/A

464770,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305428484,Reviewer,"[32, 42]","There's a good film in here somewhere just aching to get out, but the filmmakers seem more interested in playing Box Office Wheel of Fortune than caring about the quality of the product they're trying to sell, and it makes ""Color of Night,"" directed by Richard Rush, one of those movies that makes you shake your head and think, Ah! what could have been if only!  And that single ""if"" makes all the difference in the world with regards to what finally winds up on the screen.When his treatment of a patient fails and ends tragically, leaving him with some pronounced psychological damage of his own, New York psychologist Dr. Bill Capa (Bruce Willis) quits his practice and goes to Los Angeles seeking the solace and, perhaps, the help of an old friend and colleague, Dr. Bob Moore (Scott Bakula).  Capa quickly discovers, however, that Moore is having problems of his own, apparently stemming from a weekly group therapy session he has been conducting for some time.  Moore, it seems, has recently received some death threats, which he believes are coming from one of the patients of this particular group, though he hasn't a clue which one, nor any proof of his suspicions.Moore invites Capa to sit in on the next group session, hoping for a fresh perspective and possibly some insights into the matter.  At the moment, Capa feels incapable of actively engaging in the practice of his chosen field of endeavor, but in light of the fact that he's Bob's house guest, he acquiesces and agrees to observe the group.  But it proves to be an inauspicious proposition for all concerned, and subsequent circumstances quickly put Capa at the center of just the kind of situation he left New York to avoid.  Once the hand is dealt, however, he has no choice but to play it out to the end.Rush began his career as a director with low budget exploitation films like ""Too Soon to Love"" in 1960, and ten films later achieved legitimate status with the highly successful black comedy, ""The Stunt Man"" in 1980, for which he received an Oscar nomination (along with his leading man, Peter O'Toole).  He did not direct again until this film, some fourteen years later, and during that hiatus, Rush apparently lost whatever expertise he had accrued by 1980, and his ""roots"" are clearly showing in this one.  The violence of the film is inherent in the story, but Rush makes it unnecessarily graphic; and while this could have been an incisive and insightful character study (and intrinsically more interesting), he takes the low road, fleshing it out instead with scenes of gratuitous sex and nudity, as well as superfluous action (he works in no less than two ridiculous car chases, one culminating in a vehicle being pushed from the top of a high rise parking garage).  Furthermore, he ignores motivations and character development almost entirely; the two areas that required the most attention if this film was going to work at all.Rush especially lets his actors down, inasmuch as most of these characters presented real challenges that could have been met much more successfully with the help and guidance of the director.  Rush would have served his actors, as well as himself, better had he taken the time to explore these people being portrayed with some depth.  He apparently did not, however, and with one exception the performances by one and all suffer for it.In 1994, Bruce Willis simply was not the accomplished actor he is today, and he, especially, could have used some help in finding his character.  it was help he obviously did not get, and his Capa ends up being too much John McClane and not enough Malcom Crowe.  Willis flounders between the two personalities, creating a kind of schizophrenic characterization that seriously affects the credibility of his portrayal.  And it's the same fate suffered by Scott Bakula here.  Even in the scenes which places them in their ""professional"" setting as psychoanalysts, they are simply not convincing.Making the case of poor directing even stronger are the performances of Lesley Ann Warren (Sondra), Brad Dourif (Clark), Ruben Blades (Lt. Martinez) and Kevin J. O'Connor (Casey).  Like Willis, all of them seem to have trouble defining their individual characters, vacillating between any number of personalities and unable to achieve that necessary, final focus.  It's the kind of indecisiveness that is usually resolved during rehearsals, but inexplicably made it to the screen here.  The single exception is the performance turned in by Lance Henriksen, as Buck, who unlike his costars, somehow managed to find his character and make him convincing.The odd-""woman""-out of the entire bunch is Jane March, who as Rose has perhaps the most challenging role of all, and when given the opportunity actually displays some talent.  Unfortunately, Rush-- for the most part-- uses her in a way that is demeaning and without merit, and she becomes the object of a sleight-of-hand that is nothing more than a cheap trick Rush pulls out of his hat.  And by failing to use her in a more productive way, by not concentrating on developing her character (which is so vital to the story), Rush commits his most critical error of all.The supporting cast includes Eriq La Salle (Detective Anderson), Jeff Corey (Ashland), Kathleen Wilhoite (Michelle), Shirley Knight (Edith Niedelmeyer), John Bower (Medical Examiner) and Andrew Lowrey (Dale Dexter).  The high note of this entire project was played before it ever even got off the ground, that being the story itself; but screenwriters Matthew Chapman and Billy Ray proceeded to methodically remove any and all credibility it may have initially contained, and Rush took it from there, taking ""Color of Night"" straight into that black hole reserved for movies that fail to deliver on their promise.  It is not surprising that Rush has not directed a feature film since this one; once the magic is lost, it's hard to retrieve.",2,"The ""Color"" is Bleak",1026086400,"07 8, 2002",2002,5909,"['good',

464775,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,6305428484,the masked reviewer,"[3, 4]","Just when you thought they'd never make a mystery thriller as deliriously bad as Midnight Lace, just when you imagined that the gold lame spirit of Douglas Sirk had departed forever, comes director Richard Rush's Color of Night to brighten up your dull evenings. Color of Night isn't just bad: it's bad with raisins in it.If you were one of the few who saw Color of Night in a theater, you probably remember the plot, but for those millions and millions who missed this gem, Let's recap.Bruce Willis stars as a psychologist. Are you laughing too hard or can we go on now? Willis is having a crisis of conscience/confidence because one of his patients leaped out of a window after applying lots of lipstick - we all know, don't we, that applying lots of lipstick is a sure sign of suicidal depression? Anyway, Willis goes out to L.A. to visit fellow shrink Scott Bakula, who takes Willis to his group therapy session so that the fun can start in earnest. Remember ""The Bob Newhart Show"" from the '70's? His group therapy meetings weren't nearly as funny as these: we have a nympho, an obsessive-compulsive, a split personality, the Professor and Mary Ann - well, you get the idea. Bakula gets killed in a scene that looks like Psycho directed by Mack Sennett. The sad part is that Bakula is the most talented and attractive member of the whole freakin' cast and 30 minutes into the picture he's been bumped off.Willis stays on in Bakula's grandiosely modern home (crammed with screamingly bad art) despite the fact that someone keeps stalking him and leaving snakes in the mailbox. Are hotels in L.A. that expensive? It's like the TV movie where that devil doll keeps chasing Karen Black around her apartment going, ""Yanni yanni yanni,"" and it never occurs to her to just leave.Instead of ruining the horribly implausible and helter-skelter plot for you, we'll just point out some of the more outrageous lapses of sanity: a) Willis's patient jumps out of a Manhattan office tower, causing pedestrians to scream and run, whereas real New Yorkers would have lifted her purse; b) Three days after famous psychologist Scott Bakula is killed in an exceedingly colorful way in his midtown office, his patients still don't know about it - okay, we've already established that there are no reasonably priced hotels in L.A., but surely there must be at least one newspaper or TV station; c) The whole plot hook - Willis goes color blind after seeing his patient's blood--goes nowhere. Period. We kept thinking there had to be a reason for it or a plot twist that depended on it - but nothing ever happens.The film is a laugh riot and we don't want to give away all of the jokes. When we saw the film in the theater, the audience laughed all the way through the first sex scene, which took place underwater and was about as erotic as an Esther Williams movie. Oh, yes, we do get to see generous portions of Bruce Willis, though not as much as he'd have liked.Then there's the acting. Even the extras overact. Keep your eyes out for one unbilled woman playing a hooker in a police station. She only has one line, but she gives it such gusto that she leaves the audience stunned. Even formerly respected actors lose all sense of self-control; Lesley Ann Warren (decked out in a Shelley Long wig) twitches and twitters like a road company Billie Burke, and Ruben Blades does what appears to be a Jose Jimenez imitation. Willis actually seems like a model of intelligent understatement compared with the rest of the cast, but the truth is, he just wasn't acting at all.And then there's Jane March. Ever so much of Jane March. Watching her try to match wits with Bruce Willis really makes you appreciate the bang-up job Cybill Shepherd was doing all those years. Jane spends half the movie dressed in disguise as a teenage boy. I mean, how hard is she to spot? She's got teeth like Bucky Beaver, for goodness sake. (That gal could eat corn on the cob through a picket fence!).It all gets sillier and sillier until the grand finale, which tried to come off as Hitchcockian but reminded us more of Harold Lloyd. Judging by the guffaws from the audience, we were not alone. So, buy this if you're feeling down in the mouth.

Willis/Warren/Bakula/Henricksen: great actors...could've been an excellent movie...if it weren't for the script, the score and one horrible casting choice. I wish I could say that this was at least a guilty pleasure but, I can't. In order for it to qualify as a guilty pleasure, it would have had to have been laughable. But, we're being begged to take this silly movie seriously (just listen to the clawingly sappy score.) They could've achieved laughable by recasting the entire movie so that all of the actor's were of the same caliber as Jane March...and normally, I wouldn't stoop to attacking someone's looks but, since I can't see how else she would've gotten this role, I will...How DO all those teeth fit in her head anyway?

464777,ASJ89T42CIUHU,6305428484,V. Marshall,"[7, 9]","Despite the sensationalism of this film back in the 90's in remains a classic murder mystery with many twists and turns which only add to the suspense. It actually is a very well written movie and has more to offer than a few naked bodies.It begins with a psychiatric tragedy and a psychiatrist who begins to doubt his ability after one of his patients dies. Dr. Bill Capa (Bruce Willis) heads for Los Angeles and some rest at the home of his friend Dr. Bob Moore (Scott Bakula). Within a few short days Dr. Capa's life is tossed upside down and he finds himself involved in a murder mystery, a new affair and working again with a crazy group of patients. But soon the patients begin to disappear and slowly an interesting sequence of events reveals a plot filled with all sorts of surprises.Bruce Willis is interesting in his role as Dr. Capa; he has a bit more to do in this role than just action shots. Jane March is wonderful and maybe a bit confusing for some. Together the pair work well and manage to pull off their parts decently despite taking off their clothes quiet often as well. Lesley Ann Warren plays a great neurotic obsessed with her sexuality. Ruben Blades offers a bit of hilarity as a cop bent on solving a mystery despite the complications and Lance Henriksen, Brad Dourif and Kevin J. O'Connor round out the remaining patients each with a distinct personality disorder. Overall this picture is well cast and is capable of holding your attention in one way or another. I found the story to be very well thought out and even surprising. So depending on what your favorite color happens to be you will probably find it somehow woven into this complicated film.",4,Quite Colorful!,1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,1679,"['sensationalism', 'film', 'back', '90', 'classic', 'murder', 'mystery', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'only', 'suspense', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'movie', 'more', 'offer', 'few', 'naked', 'bodies.It', 'psychiatric', 'tragedy', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'doubt', 'ability', 'one', 'patients', 'dies', 'Dr.', 'Bill', 'Capa', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'heads', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'rest', 'home', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Bob', 'Moore', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'few', 'short', 'days', 'Dr.', 'Capa', 'life', 'tossed', 'upside', 'down', 'involved', 'murder', 'mystery', 'new', 'affair', 'working', 'again', 'crazy', 'group', 'patients', 'soon', 'patients', 'begin', 'disappear', 'slowly', 'interesting', 'sequence', 'events', 'reveals', 'plot', 'filled', 'sorts', 'surprises.Bruce', 'Willis', 'interesting', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Capa', 'bit', 'more', 'do', 'role', 'just', 'action', 'shots', 'Jane', 'March', 'wonderful', 'maybe', 'bit', 'confusing', 'pair', 'work', 'well', 'manage', 'pull', 'off', 'parts', 'decently', 'taking', 'off', 'clothes', 'quiet', 'often', 'as', 'well', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'great', 'neurotic', 'obsessed', 'sexuality', 'Ruben', 'Blades', 'bit', 'hilarity', 'cop', 'bent', 'solving', 'mystery', 'complications', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Kevin', 'J.', ""O'Connor"", 'round', 'out', 'remaining', 'patients', 'distinct', 'personality', 'disorder', 'picture', 'well', 'cast', 'capable', 'holding', 'attention', 'one', 'way', 'found', 'story', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'even', 'surprising', 'So', 'depending', 'what', 'favorite', 'color', 'be', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'somehow', 'woven', 'complicated', 'film']",N/A
