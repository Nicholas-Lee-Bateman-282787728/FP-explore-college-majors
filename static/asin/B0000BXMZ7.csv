771615,A9TX7L1HNM37V,B0000BXMZ7,"Amazon Customer ""A Strange Hero to a Select Few""","[5, 11]","If this were simply meant to be a story about two girls from different social worlds that learn about life, themselves and each other, then this would be a nice little film. But then the film pretends to actually have something new or meaningful to say about recent school shootings, and the whole thing becomes pathetic. A major theme of the film is supposedly about trying to understand why school shootings occur, yet hardly any attention is payed to the actual shooter, so we can instead spend hours hanging out with his goth girlfriend and a peppy preppie that he shot in the head during his rampage. With an intellectually dishonest and insulting attitude that presumes that simply saying that there's no real explanation counts as an explanation of some kind, and supporting this sad argument with cliched helpful teachers and misunderstanding parents, and led by a couple of cops with ham-fisted dialogue about as subtle as an episode of Dragnet, Home Room does little more than attempt to successfully tackle a controversial subject by not really saying too much about it. It's rather hard to get some insight into events like Columbine if the writer/directers attemping to tackle the subject on film have no real insights of their own. Great performances by the two girls, however.",2,"Some good performances, but never delivers the goods.",1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,1291,"['were', 'simply', 'meant', 'be', 'story', 'two', 'girls', 'different', 'social', 'worlds', 'learn', 'life', 'other', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'little', 'film', 'then', 'film', 'actually', 'have', 'something', 'new', 'meaningful', 'say', 'recent', 'school', 'shootings', 'whole', 'thing', 'pathetic', 'major', 'theme', 'film', 'supposedly', 'trying', 'understand', 'why', 'school', 'shootings', 'occur', 'yet', 'hardly', 'attention', 'payed', 'actual', 'shooter', 'can', 'instead', 'spend', 'hours', 'hanging', 'out', 'goth', 'girlfriend', 'peppy', 'preppie', 'head', 'rampage', 'intellectually', 'dishonest', 'insulting', 'attitude', 'simply', 'saying', 'real', 'explanation', 'counts', 'explanation', 'kind', 'supporting', 'sad', 'argument', 'cliched', 'helpful', 'teachers', 'misunderstanding', 'parents', 'led', 'couple', 'cops', 'ham-fisted', 'dialogue', 'as', 'subtle', 'episode', 'Dragnet', 'Home', 'Room', 'little', 'more', 'attempt', 'successfully', 'tackle', 'controversial', 'subject', 'not', 'really', 'saying', 'too', 'much', 'rather', 'hard', 'get', 'insight', 'events', 'Columbine', 'writer/directers', 'attemping', 'tackle', 'subject', 'film', 'have', 'real', 'insights', 'own', 'Great', 'performances', 'two', 'girls', 'however']",N/A
771616,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,B0000BXMZ7,Amy Lynn,"[3, 10]","Starring Busy Phillips and Erika Christensen. Busy plays Alicia, a school misfit with an attitude problem and Erika plays Deanna, the classic goody goody overachiever. Both attend the same school. During the school shooting Deanna was shot in the head. After the fact Alicia has to go to the hospital and watch over or keep Deanna company after the shooting. The 2 girls form an unlikely friendship in the aftermath and each end up discovering eachother's secrets as they both try to cope with the violence or aftermath of the shooting. Only problem I have with this movie is it shows nothing of the killers of the shooting and it isnt about the shooters or why they did it , just the aftermath or relationship between 2 girls who are in the same school. They talk about how they are treated and others diffrent perceptions of them and try to analyze eachother. I was very disapointed. Overall its a decent movie if you are looking for relationships between people or diffrent generalizations placed on kids at school due to their appearance. But this tells nothing about the shooters or people who did it, why , etc.. Its very long and the ending is corny. I recomend the film ( Zero Day ) over this in a heartbeat. It is the best film ive seen so far this year and it shows the killers and is much more interesting and compelling than this movie. If you want a good movie about school shooting go buy Zero Day, Not this. This is about 2.5 stars and Zero days a 5 star movie.

771620,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B0000BXMZ7,Artist & Author,"[2, 2]","Of the 1200+ movies I've watched in the last two years dealing with children or teens, this one has to come somewhere in the top ten.  We've had over 150 kids stay with us for varying lengths of time, and this movie reminded me of a discipline technique we used.  If two kids were fighting, we'd put them on chairs with their knees a few inches apart.  Then, they had to sit there and talk nicely to each other for a specified time.  No matter how angry they were to start, in the end they'd be laughing and getting along.Alica and Deanna were put in a similar situation.  Both girls were hurting inside, one from the effects of the classroom shooting and the other from another psychologically tragic event.  This movie is about how each girl had to first start to trust the other, then grow to understand each other.  Of course, at first much is left hidden inside, but gradually they begin to talk and each begins to understand how the other is hurting.  The more the viewer learns, the more he or she begins to care for even Alica, who escapes in a ""Goth"" world that alienates more typical teens.As the two girls slowly reveal more and more of their stories, stories of hurting, they begin to heal.  However, it is a very painful process, with many setbacks and misunderstandings along the way.  But, that is the way emotional healing is.  This is a very realistic cinematic depiction of psychological healing.Finally, it is very refreshing to see a teen, Deanna, concerned with her character and values.  For families concerned with traditional values,  this is one of the best examples of that I've seen in a teen movie.  Although curious about sex, Deanna still felt it was worthwhile to protect her virginity.  The movie is rated R mostly for the language, but Deanna even called Alicia on that.  She let Alicia know that she didn't not approve of the foul language or 'taking the Lord's name in vain.""  However, she was not perfect in this either - when she thought the detective had emotionally hurt Alicia she cussed a bit.  Also, when Alicia, more because she was a rebel than a lesbian, kissed Deanna, Deanna recoiled in revulsion.  Again, she showed concern for her reputation and traditional morality.If you genuinely care about people as they are and not how you want them to be, what one would call empathy, then this is 131 minutes of very well-spent time.",5,Everyone has a story . . .,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,2374,"['1200+', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'dealing', 'children', 'teens', 'one', 'come', 'somewhere', 'top', 'ten', ""'ve"", 'had', '150', 'kids', 'stay', 'varying', 'lengths', 'time', 'movie', 'reminded', 'discipline', 'technique', 'used', 'two', 'kids', 'were', 'fighting', ""'d"", 'put', 'chairs', 'knees', 'few', 'inches', 'apart', 'Then', 'had', 'sit', 'there', 'talk', 'nicely', 'other', 'specified', 'time', 'matter', 'how', 'angry', 'were', 'start', 'end', ""'d"", 'be', 'laughing', 'getting', 'along.Alica', 'Deanna', 'were', 'put', 'similar', 'situation', 'girls', 'were', 'hurting', 'inside', 'one', 'effects', 'classroom', 'shooting', 'other', 'psychologically', 'tragic', 'event', 'movie', 'how', 'girl', 'had', 'first', 'start', 'trust', 'other', 'then', 'grow', 'understand', 'other', 'course', 'first', 'much', 'left', 'hidden', 'inside', 'gradually', 'begin', 'talk', 'begins', 'understand', 'how', 'other', 'hurting', 'more', 'viewer', 'more', 'care', 'even', 'Alica', 'who', 'Goth', 'world', 'more', 'typical', 'two', 'girls', 'slowly', 'reveal', 'more', 'more', 'stories', 'stories', 'hurting', 'begin', 'heal', 'However', 'very', 'painful', 'process', 'many', 'setbacks', 'misunderstandings', 'way', 'way', 'emotional', 'healing', 'very', 'realistic', 'cinematic', 'depiction', 'psychological', 'healing.Finally', 'very', 'refreshing', 'see', 'teen', 'Deanna', 'concerned', 'character', 'values', 'families', 'concerned', 'traditional', 'values', 'one', 'best', 'examples', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'teen', 'movie', 'curious', 'sex', 'Deanna', 'still', 'felt', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'protect', 'virginity', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'mostly', 'language', 'Deanna', 'even', 'called', 'Alicia', 'let', 'Alicia', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'not', 'approve', 'foul', 'language', ""'taking"", 'Lord', 'name', 'vain', 'However', 'was', 'not', 'perfect', 'when', 'thought', 'detective', 'had', 'emotionally', 'hurt', 'Alicia', 'cussed', 'bit', 'Also', 'when', 'Alicia', 'more', 'was', 'rebel', 'lesbian', 'kissed', 'Deanna', 'Deanna', 'recoiled', 'revulsion', 'Again', 'showed', 'concern', 'reputation', 'traditional', 'morality.If', 'genuinely', 'care', 'about', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'how', 'want', 'be', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'call', 'empathy', 'then', '131', 'minutes', 'very', 'well-spent', 'time']",N/A
771621,A2BJAET1P9QUGZ,B0000BXMZ7,Baberufus,"[1, 4]","This was a pretty fascinating movie, and Busy (strange name) Phillips and Erika Christensen put in some fine performances. However, there are some details in the plot that don't seem to make sense to me. **SEMI SPOILER ALERT:** First of all, it comes out that Allison had a baby that died early, and that she gave birth to her baby in the same room as the one Deann is staying in. OK, that's sad, but...what does that have to do with the main story of the movie, i.e., the shootings in the school? There is no tie-in with those two parts of the story. Also, Allison finally admits that the killer told her the night before the shootings what he was going to do the next day, but it's clear she didn't condone it. So nothing is really learned about the reasoning behind the shootings. That must have been frustrating for Detective Van Zandt. And the meeting with the handful of kids in the school room was pointless. The reason Van Zandt gave to the kids for having that meeting made no sense at all...""I wanted my kid to know what to expect"" or something. Expect what? The shooting's in the past, let's move on! The only thing his kid needs to know is if some maniac goes postal and starts shooting everything right and left, either run or at least duck.I don't really understand why the principal insisted on Allison going to visit Deanna. It's nice that they became friends, but what was the initial point of those two getting together? No one else would visit her? Why? She seemed to be a popular kid, really cute. No boyfriend? Come on! Highly unlikely...So this was a unique and interesting movie, but some parts just don't make sense. And nothing exciting really happens in the whole movie, either. Kind of a blah ending.

771623,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0000BXMZ7,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","What made Home Room such a memorable movie?  Well, a bunch of things.  This movie was released during a time when school shootings started becoming a constant problem all over the country.  This prompted many films to be developed dealing with the subject.  Many of the films focused on the shooters themselves, and the quiet, eerie and unpleasant build up that would lead to a sad and tragic conclusion.Home Room however, focuses on two of the students who were right in the middle of the shooting incident inside the classroom, and the two female students end up becoming... not really friends, but two people who can talk to each other about their problems and get to know each other a little better as a result.  So Home Room is actually a movie that deals with the after effects of a sad situation.This is NOT an ordinary storyline though.  For one thing, the two students the storyline focuses on are NOTHING alike- two completely different girls with nothing in common.  When you take two high school girls with nothing in common and try getting them to be best friends, well, most of the time it ain't gonna happen, but when a major tragedy such as a school shooting enters the picture, things change then and kids tend to put aside their differences and just talk to each other.When the one girl with the goth appearance keeps visiting the other student in the hospital, the relationship slowly starts to develop.  The movie only gets better and better as the story gets more personal, and you will see (and probably feel) a TON of emotions that both girls experience as they get to know each other better each day the goth girl visits the other one.The grand finale is the ending of the movie, which reveals at LEAST three different things.  It's probably one of the best endings to a film ever, or at least, in the top 10 that I've ever seen because it's shocking, emotional, and moving.  It's *incredibly* memorable.

But even those mistakes do not stop &quot;Home Room&quot; from being a compelling film.&quot;Home Room&quot; is about the aftermath of a shooting at a high school in a small town. Writer-Director Paul F. Ryan begins his film at the moment when the shooting is over and the first person we see is the tactical officer (Harper Johnston) who had to shoot the teenage boy inside the classroom. When Detective Martin Van Zandt (Victor Garber of &quot;Alias&quot;) enters the room there the bodies of the shooter and his dead classmates, along with one living person, a girl standing in the corner.Alicia Browning (Busy Philipps of &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;) is your typical Goth girl, but after being grilled by the police she goes home and turns herself blonde. Meanwhile, Van Zandt is ordered by his superior to find somebody to be held accountable for this tragedy. The shooter is dead and he killed his parents, from whom he got his gun, but the community is outraged and demands somebody be brought to justice. When it turns out that the shooter called Alicia the night before and talked for an hour, she becomes the prime suspect.All Alicia wants to do is to graduate from high school and get out of town as quickly as possible. She has already missed a year of school, further alienating her from her classmates. When she goes to school to study for final exams she discovers it is closed, and when Principal Robbins (James Pickens, Jr.) learns she is spending her time smoking on the roof of her house, he forces Alicia to look in on Deanna Cartwright (Erika Christensen of &quot;Traffic&quot;), who is recovering from both a head wound and the trauma of being shot at the local hospital. The two have never talked before and Alicia dismisses Deanna, at one point calling her a girl who would see the silver lining in a mushroom cloud.Obviously we have seen countless films where two people who have nothing in common forged a friendship, however unlikely and tenuous. But in &quot;Home Room&quot; that is only the framework for dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic experience. There are depths to both characters to be explored and this film takes its time in doing so. All of the dramatic threads come together in a scene that takes us back to where we started and examines from a different perspective what we think we know about what happened and these characters. You might see one of the surprises that comes in this climatic scene, but I do not think anybody is going to see all of them coming.But then we are treated to a montage of the teenagers offering explanations as to &quot;why&quot; that looks like a public service announcement by the government and then goes right into a music video as Sarah McLachlan's &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; provides a musical benediction to the final silent scene between Deanna and Alicia. I swear, it was like somebody else came in and directed the final minutes of the movie. From a dramatic narrative &quot;Home Room&quot; suddenly becomes a film that wants to discuss big issues out in the real world and the shift is just too abrupt and too heavy handed.&quot;Home Room&quot; comes down to the performances of Philipps and Christensen, who both do a good job of getting beyond the stereotypical characters to show the traumatic aftermath of what they have been through, even as we are learning more about those traumas. I am sure there are serious discussions to be had over the question of violence and shootings in schools, and watching this film may well engender them. But I still think the human drama here stands on it's own, despite the problematic ending.",4,An independent film on the aftermath of a school shooting,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,3851,"['do', 'not', 'know', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'offered', 'series', 'stunning', 'revelations', 'climax', 'then', 'threw', 'away', 'big', 'finish', 'pair', 'directing', 'theatrics', 'totally', 'place', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'even', 'mistakes', 'do', 'not', 'stop', 'quot', 'Home', 'Room', 'quot', 'being', 'compelling', 'film.', 'quot', 'Home', 'Room', 'quot', 'aftermath', 'shooting', 'high', 'school', 'small', 'town', 'Writer-Director', 'Paul', 'F.', 'Ryan', 'film', 'moment', 'when', 'shooting', 'first', 'person', 'see', 'tactical', 'officer', 'Harper', 'Johnston', 'who', 'had', 'shoot', 'teenage', 'boy', 'classroom', 'When', 'Detective', 'Martin', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'quot', 'Alias', 'quot', 'room', 'bodies', 'shooter', 'dead', 'classmates', 'one', 'living', 'person', 'girl', 'standing', 'corner.Alicia', 'Browning', 'Busy', 'Philipps', 'quot', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'quot', 'typical', 'Goth', 'girl', 'being', 'grilled', 'police', 'home', 'blonde', 'Meanwhile', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'ordered', 'superior', 'find', 'somebody', 'be', 'held', 'accountable', 'tragedy', 'shooter', 'dead', 'killed', 'parents', 'whom', 'got', 'gun', 'community', 'outraged', 'demands', 'somebody', 'be', 'brought', 'justice', 'When', 'out', 'shooter', 'called', 'Alicia', 'night', 'talked', 'hour', 'prime', 'suspect.All', 'Alicia', 'do', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'get', 'town', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'already', 'missed', 'year', 'school', 'further', 'alienating', 'classmates', 'When', 'school', 'study', 'final', 'exams', 'closed', 'when', 'Principal', 'Robbins', 'James', 'Pickens', 'Jr.', 'spending', 'time', 'smoking', 'roof', 'house', 'Alicia', 'look', 'Deanna', 'Cartwright', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'quot', 'Traffic', 'quot', 'who', 'recovering', 'head', 'wound', 'trauma', 'being', 'shot', 'local', 'hospital', 'two', 'have', 'never', 'talked', 'Alicia', 'Deanna', 'one', 'point', 'calling', 'girl', 'who', 'would', 'see', 'silver', 'lining', 'mushroom', 'cloud.Obviously', 'have', 'seen', 'countless', 'films', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'common', 'forged', 'friendship', 'however', 'unlikely', 'tenuous', 'quot', 'Home', 'Room', 'quot', 'only', 'framework', 'dealing', 'aftermath', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'are', 'depths', 'characters', 'be', 'explored', 'film', 'time', 'doing', 'so', 'dramatic', 'threads', 'come', 'together', 'scene', 'back', 'where', 'started', 'examines', 'different', 'perspective', 'what', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'might', 'see', 'one', 'surprises', 'climatic', 'scene', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'anybody', 'going', 'see', 'coming.But', 'then', 'are', 'treated', 'montage', 'teenagers', 'offering', 'explanations', 'quot', 'why', 'quot', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'government', 'then', 'right', 'music', 'video', 'Sarah', 'McLachlan', 'quot', 'Sweet', 'Surrender', 'quot', 'musical', 'benediction', 'final', 'silent', 'scene', 'Deanna', 'Alicia', 'swear', 'was', 'somebody', 'else', 'came', 'directed', 'final', 'minutes', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'narrative', 'quot', 'Home', 'Room', 'quot', 'suddenly', 'film', 'discuss', 'big', 'issues', 'out', 'real', 'world', 'shift', 'just', 'too', 'abrupt', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed.', 'quot', 'Home', 'Room', 'quot', 'down', 'performances', 'Philipps', 'Christensen', 'who', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'getting', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'show', 'traumatic', 'aftermath', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'are', 'learning', 'more', 'traumas', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'serious', 'discussions', 'be', 'had', 'question', 'violence', 'shootings', 'schools', 'watching', 'film', 'may', 'well', 'engender', 'still', 'think', 'human', 'drama', 'here', 'own', 'problematic', 'ending']",N/A

771631,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0000BXMZ7,Only-A-Child,"[15, 18]","""Home Room"" like ""Zero Day"" and ""Elephant"", was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings. But unlike the other two films, ""Home Room"" focuses on two survivors (not the shooters or those killed) in the aftermath of a shooting. Making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answers.Don't give up on this little film during the first 20 minutes, it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected ""Hill Street Blues"" episode. It is lame but bear with it, at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature. I recommend skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenes-there is nothing here that you can't pick up from the remainder of the film.Like a lot of good little films this was creatively a one-man show as Paul F. Ryan was both the writer and the director. While this arrangement does not guarantee a good film, it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features. Because the script of ""Home Room"" is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer handed the production post-production; insuring that his vision made it onto the screen.Ryan takes a huge chance with an ending that tests the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance. He runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing. Why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey, the song (Sarah McLaughlin's ""Sweet Surrender"") he goes out on, and the amazing editing of the final few seconds.The other strength of the film is the casting of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as the main protagonists. Although Phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and Christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family, they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to Ryan. What is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie Alicia to the lone shooter. If they ever re-cut and trim the film this side story should be condensed.A story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and Ryan could have easily steered this film into clich&eacute; and predictability. But instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match, slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability, only to retreat back inside themselves. Deanna's ""I'm dying inside"" line just tears you apart-I can't think of a moment in any other film that I felt as intensely as that one. She desperately needs a connection that Alicia just as desperately resists. Deanna only makes progress when she retreats. The viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happen.Ultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to life.Then again, what do I know?

771632,A172M9D4FZW64S,B0000BXMZ7,P. French,"[5, 6]","This review is for the ones like me who were concerned about scary images. Not too many worries here, there's no gruesome cadavers or blood spurts, they only show a close-up of a teen who had gotten shot, but all you see is some blood on one girl's head. There is a scene with a dead body, but it's not presented in a scary ""Hollywood"" type of way, it's very peaceful, and the dialogue between the two main characters is beautiful here. FYI: the body is not a shooting victim. I actually found that some of the dialogue was more disturbing than the film itself. For example, near the beginning when Busy Philipps asks Erika Christensen if she knows why carnations have become the ""funeral flower"" and she tells her because back in the old days before they could embalm the body, they would use the flowers to try and ""cover up the smell of the rotting flesh,"" that kinda creeped me out. So yeah, there's just a few little things like that. Overall the movie is fairly intense, if you're super sensitive to movies and such you'll probably need to watch something light afterwards.
