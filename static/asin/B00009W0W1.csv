I am a big fan of his music, but I enjoy having his singing supported by the full orchestrations of the original hits. Too often this was not the case on the videos. I did enjoy the video with k.d. lang on Crying. It is the best part of the entire selection of performances.",2,Not Up to Standards,1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,343,"['found', 'DVD', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'be', 'disappointment', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'music', 'enjoy', 'having', 'singing', 'supported', 'full', 'orchestrations', 'original', 'hits', 'Too', 'often', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'videos', 'did', 'enjoy', 'video', 'k.d', 'lang', 'Crying', 'best', 'part', 'entire', 'selection', 'performances']",N/A

It has a great selection of concert tracks from various stages in his career, then when you switch to the special features you find almost a whole disk's worth of video and audio extras.  There are even original and remastered versions of one audio (""An Empty Cup""), for comparison.  So it is a great DVD for the serious collector as well as a perfect introduction for those new to Orbison.Between tracks, Roy says a few words about each song.  He comes across as personable, modest and sensitive.He was at times a bigger star in Britain and elsewhere than in his native US, and his contribution to Rock 'n' Roll has only recently been fully acknowledged.  This DVD should help put the record straight.",5,All music DVDs should be this good,1102809600,"12 12, 2004",2004,1030,"['Roy', 'Orbison', 'widow', 'Barbara', 'put', 'lot', 'thought', 'effort', 'packaging', 'compilations', 'work', 'wide', 'selection', 'available', 'now', 'may', 'want', 'visit', 'offical', 'website', 'peruse', 'what', 'available', 'before', 'deciding', 'what', 'buy', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'particular', 'DVD', 'great', 'selection', 'concert', 'tracks', 'various', 'stages', 'career', 'then', 'when', 'switch', 'special', 'features', 'find', 'almost', 'whole', 'disk', 'worth', 'video', 'audio', 'extras', 'are', 'even', 'original', 'remastered', 'versions', 'one', 'audio', 'Empty', 'Cup', 'comparison', 'great', 'DVD', 'serious', 'collector', 'as', 'well', 'perfect', 'introduction', 'new', 'Orbison.Between', 'tracks', 'Roy', 'few', 'words', 'song', 'personable', 'modest', 'sensitive.He', 'was', 'times', 'bigger', 'star', 'Britain', 'elsewhere', 'native', 'US', 'contribution', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'only', 'recently', 'been', 'fully', 'acknowledged', 'DVD', 'should', 'help', 'put', 'record', 'straight']",N/A

In most cases, the refurbished tracks sound great and there is no gimmicky processing of old mono clips into surround sound. (For proof, check the mono-to-5.1 comparison of ""Crying"" that is included as a bonus feature.)The surround sound comes in two flavors - Dolby Digital and DTS, but it's the latter that really shines. And there's also the original mono sound on some clips for the purists.Even the old mono clips sound terrific, and have great presence. But of course they aren't a patch on the 5.1 clips from ""A Black And White Night"" and ""Live At Austin City Limits"" remixed by Elliott Scheiner.The down side? If you already own the two above-named DVDs, this one has a lot of material in common with them.The up side? The great care that has been lavished on this set, including little touches like the snippets from a Roy Orbison interview that play between the songs and let you hear from the man himself about he created and recorded some of his best known songs.You also get two bonus videos - ""Mystery Girl"" and the duet version of ""Crying"" recorded with k.d. lang that have been remixed into 5.1 sound, and two electronic press kits.One of the kits features interviews with the musicians who helped finish ""King Of Hearts"", Orbison's posthumous album, and the other focusses on the making of the video for ""I Drove All Night"" featuring a very young Jennifer Connelly and Jason Priestley. As a real bonus, this kit features the complete video for the song too.Not a bad choice if you're looking for a DVD that introduces you to the many charms of the Big O.",4,A great introduction to the Big O,1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,2205,"['defenitely', 'not', 'best', 'overview', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'amazing', 'talents', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'quick', 'glimpse', 'set', 'apart', 'rest', 'heartfelt', 'lyrics', 'superb', 'musicianship', 'else', 'magnificent', 'soaring', 'voice.Roy', 'Orbison', 'widow', 'Barbara', 'taken', 'lot', 'care', 'put', 'together', 'package', '12', 'live', 'performances', 'spanning', 'Roy', 'career', '1960s', 'late', '1980s', 'early', 'promotional', 'video', 'Walk', '1970s.The', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'fairly', 'spotty', 'great', 'deal', 'care', 'been', 'taken', 'clean', 'up', 'clips', 'upgrade', '5.1', 'sound', 'most', 'cases', 'refurbished', 'tracks', 'sound', 'great', 'gimmicky', 'processing', 'old', 'mono', 'surround', 'sound', 'proof', 'check', 'mono-to-5.1', 'comparison', 'Crying', 'included', 'bonus', 'feature', 'surround', 'sound', 'two', 'flavors', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'DTS', 'latter', 'really', 'also', 'original', 'mono', 'sound', 'clips', 'purists.Even', 'old', 'mono', 'clips', 'sound', 'terrific', 'have', 'great', 'presence', 'course', 'are', ""n't"", 'patch', '5.1', 'clips', 'A', 'Black', 'White', 'Night', 'Live', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'remixed', 'Elliott', 'Scheiner.The', 'down', 'side', 'already', 'own', 'two', 'above-named', 'DVDs', 'one', 'lot', 'material', 'common', 'them.The', 'up', 'side', 'great', 'care', 'been', 'lavished', 'set', 'including', 'little', 'touches', 'snippets', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'interview', 'play', 'songs', 'let', 'hear', 'man', 'created', 'recorded', 'best', 'known', 'songs.You', 'also', 'get', 'two', 'bonus', 'videos', 'Mystery', 'Girl', 'duet', 'version', 'Crying', 'recorded', 'k.d', 'lang', 'have', 'been', 'remixed', '5.1', 'sound', 'two', 'electronic', 'press', 'kits.One', 'kits', 'features', 'interviews', 'musicians', 'who', 'helped', 'finish', 'King', 'Hearts', 'Orbison', 'posthumous', 'album', 'other', 'focusses', 'making', 'video', 'Drove', 'Night', 'featuring', 'very', 'young', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'real', 'bonus', 'kit', 'complete', 'video', 'song', 'too.Not', 'bad', 'choice', ""'re"", 'looking', 'DVD', 'many', 'charms', 'Big', 'O']",N/A

However, if you are an Orbison fan and own his other DVD's and videos (which are few in number), then the ""Greatest Hits"" DVD offers little in the way of footage you don't already own.The DVD relies heavily on footage from ""Black and White Night"", the ""Combo Concert"" from the 60's, his ""Austin City Limits"" show, and clips from the ""Anthology"" collection, all of which have already been released on DVD (and in the case of ""Combo Concert"", VHS only). The only totally ""new to DVD"" songs included in the main feature are two songs from an early 80's live show (probably a year or two before his ""Austin City Limits"" performance).The bonus features on the DVD offer some additional ""new to DVD"" footage, which is a good consolation considering all but two songs on the main feature are common for any Orbison fan.This DVD is still a must-own for Orbison fans for the new material that is presented on this DVD, and the price is somewhat fair.
