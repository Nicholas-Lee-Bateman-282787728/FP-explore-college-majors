Now that I write screenplays, I have recently come to admire what a terrific film it is. Both director George Roy Hill and writer William Goldman hit pay dirt with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in 1969 and reunited for TGWP in the mid 1970&#8217;s. Though Pepper was not a huge commercial success, they crafted a multi-layered film that has stood the test of time. What I originally thought was a popcorn movie about barnstorming pilots is really a movie about adrenaline junkies chasing the dragon; and when the opportunity arises, catching it. All the actors turn in solid performances, particularly Redford and Swedish actor Bo Brundin as Pepper&#8217;s archrival Ernst Kessler. The two actors have some wonderful scenes discussing Kessler&#8217;s legendary WWI dogfight and at the end of the movie, have an epic battle of their own. I would also like to commend writer Goldman for his ability to visualize incredible aerial actions sequences, as well as Hill&#8217;s ability to capture them on film.

Yet it holds up as a great movie for me 28 years after it was made (unlike some others I could name).I like Robert Redford in almost anything, and he's at his best here as a barnstorming pilot in the 1920s who pretends to have seen more action in World War One than he did. He made me feel for the character when he said, &quot;It should have been me&quot; after rival flyer Axel Olsen exposed him as a &quot;four-flusher&quot; for claiming he was a key figure in a famous battle.Pepper finally gets his chance to go up against the German World War One ace Ernst Kessler (perhaps loosely based on the real German ace Ernst Udet) as a stunt pilot in a movie crew.The dialogue scenes between Pepper and Kessler leading up to the climactic dogfight are the best part of the movie, even though Kessler's lines seemed to be written more in the interest of serving the plot than in serving the character.The idea that Kessler was a man who only felt at home in the air, for whom nothing worked out well on the ground, resonated with me, as it did with Pepper, who felt the same way.In closing, I'd like to mention the beginning of the movie when Waldo Pepper lands at a small town in Iowa to offer airplane rides. He promises a free ride at the end of the day to a boy named Scooter if he will tote a 5-gallon gas can back and forth from the filling station to keep Pepper's plane fueled.The song that plays over the opening credits during this sequence has stuck with me for 28 years. I heard it again in 1992 while attending a boot camp graduation ceremony at the Great Lakes Naval Recruit Training Command and remembered it from the movie. I don't know the name of it, but I love that song.Anyway, at the end of the day Scooter asks for his free ride and Pepper says he only promised that to get him to haul gas. He never takes kids for rides. Whether the character is kidding or not isn't clear, but it certainly seems that Scooter (and his dog) get the best ride of the day.That sequence establishes Pepper as a decent, if somewhat slippery character and gets the movie off to a good start.",5,The word &quot;great&quot; also describes the movie,1042329600,"01 12, 2003",2003,2170,"['movie', 'special', 'significance', 'first', 'saw', 'teenager', 'up', 'great', 'movie', '28', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'others', 'could', 'name', '.I', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'almost', 'anything', 'best', 'here', 'barnstorming', 'pilot', '1920s', 'who', 'pretends', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'action', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'did', 'made', 'feel', 'character', 'when', 'said', 'quot', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'quot', 'rival', 'flyer', 'Axel', 'Olsen', 'exposed', 'quot', 'four-flusher', 'quot', 'claiming', 'was', 'key', 'figure', 'famous', 'battle.Pepper', 'finally', 'chance', 'go', 'up', 'German', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'ace', 'Ernst', 'Kessler', 'perhaps', 'loosely', 'based', 'real', 'German', 'ace', 'Ernst', 'Udet', 'stunt', 'pilot', 'movie', 'crew.The', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'Pepper', 'Kessler', 'leading', 'up', 'climactic', 'dogfight', 'are', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'even', 'Kessler', 'lines', 'seemed', 'be', 'written', 'more', 'interest', 'serving', 'plot', 'serving', 'character.The', 'idea', 'Kessler', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'felt', 'home', 'air', 'whom', 'nothing', 'worked', 'out', 'well', 'ground', 'resonated', 'did', 'Pepper', 'who', 'felt', 'same', 'way.In', 'closing', ""'d"", 'like', 'mention', 'beginning', 'movie', 'when', 'Waldo', 'Pepper', 'small', 'town', 'Iowa', 'offer', 'airplane', 'rides', 'free', 'ride', 'end', 'day', 'boy', 'named', 'Scooter', 'will', 'tote', '5-gallon', 'gas', 'can', 'back', 'forth', 'filling', 'station', 'keep', 'Pepper', 'plane', 'fueled.The', 'song', 'opening', 'credits', 'sequence', 'stuck', '28', 'years', 'heard', 'again', '1992', 'attending', 'boot', 'camp', 'graduation', 'ceremony', 'Great', 'Lakes', 'Naval', 'Recruit', 'Training', 'Command', 'remembered', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'love', 'song.Anyway', 'end', 'day', 'Scooter', 'free', 'ride', 'Pepper', 'only', 'promised', 'get', 'haul', 'gas', 'never', 'kids', 'rides', 'character', 'kidding', 'not', ""n't"", 'clear', 'certainly', 'Scooter', 'dog', 'get', 'best', 'ride', 'day.That', 'sequence', 'Pepper', 'decent', 'somewhat', 'slippery', 'character', 'movie', 'good', 'start']",N/A

Robert Redford is perfectly cast as a charismatic barnstormer who still yearns to have flown against legendary German ace Ernst Kessler in the 'Great War'. Instead, he barely makes ends meet as an itinerant pilot with a gaudy yellow J-1 Standard biplane. After being grounded for his involvement in two fatal accidents, Waldo illegally takes a stunt-flying job on a movie (under an assumed name)---and walks right into his longed-for encounter with Kessler. The film is full of flying sequences with actors genuinely airborne in vintage aircraft. It would probably be impossible to get such a film insured today, and the entire cast deserves credit for bravery as much as for talent. The darker realities of flying in that era make THE GREAT WALDO PEPPER a difficult film in places; the story may be too honest for some, frankly acknowledging some barnstorming pilots' recklessness and disregard for safety. (It happens that several airshow pilots whom I'd met flew for this film---and died in subsequent aviation accidents.)
