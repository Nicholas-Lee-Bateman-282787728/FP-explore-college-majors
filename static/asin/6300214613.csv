I rarely laugh out load at a film at home, but I was constantly laughing at this wonderfully funny film.What great take offs on the typical western film characters and situations! The lone cowboy in clothes no self respecting cowboy would wear. A fantastic horse names Wildfire, who danced better than Gene Kelly or Fred Astire. The music hall hostess who charged $600 a night, but only talked to her clients (Miss Kitty from ""Gunsmoke"" maybe?)The town drunk who wants to become the hero's sidekick. The mysterious ""root"" that makes anyone eating it feel soooo good.Tom Berenger is great as the virginal, overdressed hero. He kids this stereotype magnificently. G. W. Bailey almost steals the film as the drunk/sidekick. Marilu Henner is just right as the sexy hostess. Sela Ward is perfect as the villain's daughter who has a special problem with her horse. Andy Griffith makes a delightful comic ""villain"". The whole cast is wonderful.Anyone who doesn't know the old westerns might be lost and think this film not too good, but for those who remember the ""cowboys"" mentioned earlier, this is a comic treasure!Be sure to watch the credits at the end of the film to hear a lovely balled, ""Lasso You The Moon"", sung by Gary Morris.This film is so much better than ""Blazing Saddles"" (which is a very funny film) without being crude or making rude ethnic jokes that leave today's audiences uncomfortable as does ""Saddles"".",5,Wonderful Western Satire,1086480000,"06 6, 2004",2004,1831,"['Return', 'now', 'thrilling', 'days', 'yesteryear', 'past', 'come', 'thundering', 'hoofbeats', 'great', 'hourse', 'Silver', 'lone', 'st', 'ranger', 'rides', 'again', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'remember', 'quote', 'words', 'was', 'raised', 'watching', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'Gene', 'Autrey', 'Hopalong', 'Cassidy', 'Cisco', 'Kid', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'westerns', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'listening', 'radio', 'film', 'hoot', 'half', 'rarely', 'out', 'load', 'film', 'home', 'was', 'constantly', 'laughing', 'wonderfully', 'funny', 'film.What', 'great', 'take', 'offs', 'typical', 'western', 'film', 'characters', 'situations', 'lone', 'cowboy', 'clothes', 'self', 'respecting', 'cowboy', 'would', 'wear', 'A', 'fantastic', 'horse', 'names', 'Wildfire', 'who', 'danced', 'better', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'Fred', 'Astire', 'music', 'hall', 'hostess', 'who', 'charged', '600', 'night', 'only', 'talked', 'clients', 'Miss', 'Kitty', 'Gunsmoke', 'maybe', 'town', 'drunk', 'who', 'become', 'hero', 'sidekick', 'mysterious', 'root', 'anyone', 'eating', 'feel', 'soooo', 'good.Tom', 'Berenger', 'great', 'virginal', 'overdressed', 'hero', 'stereotype', 'magnificently', 'G.', 'W.', 'Bailey', 'almost', 'film', 'drunk/sidekick', 'Marilu', 'Henner', 'just', 'right', 'sexy', 'hostess', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'perfect', 'villain', 'daughter', 'who', 'special', 'problem', 'horse', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'delightful', 'comic', 'villain', 'whole', 'cast', 'wonderful.Anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'old', 'westerns', 'might', 'be', 'lost', 'think', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'good', 'who', 'remember', 'cowboys', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'comic', 'treasure', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'credits', 'end', 'film', 'hear', 'lovely', 'balled', 'Lasso', 'Moon', 'sung', 'Gary', 'Morris.This', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'being', 'crude', 'making', 'rude', 'ethnic', 'jokes', 'leave', 'today', 'audiences', 'uncomfortable', 'Saddles']",Rustlers' Rhapsody VHS

Tom Berrenger, Andy Griffith, Sela Ward, and many more people you'll recognize. That's another reason I can't beleive people haven't seen this.The story is a western spoof. The hero comes to the western town being used and abused by the evil cattle baron. The hero must stop them and overcome some of his own problems. The story also reveals why the bad guys always lose and why the good guys always win.The movie is great. I guarentee it will make you laugh and laugh hard.

The whole cast is perfect; the direction is right on--congratulations, Mr. Wilson.  There are a ton of priceless scenes, too many to mention.

214039,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6300214613,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Rustlers' Rhapsody was one of those films that had the misfortune to be made for a cinema audience that no longer existed: not only was it a comedy Western in 1985, the spoof landscape having moved on a long way since Blazing Saddles barely over a decade earlier, but it was a gentle and affectionate comedy Western parodying 30s and 40s matinee B movies that were no longer even playing on TV, so a fair portion of the small audience that might have been lured in by Police Academy director Hugh Wilson's name probably didn't get the joke. But if you are well versed in Western lore and can give it a reel or two to find its feet after an unsteady start, it's really rather delightful. Tom Berenger is singing cowboy Rex O'Herlihan, drifting into yet another stereotypical Western town where they complain if there isn't a hair in the gin and where another power mad cattle baron (Andy Griffith) with thousands of cattle you hear but never see is at war with the local sheep herders who smell awful and rely on passing strangers who only ever shoot the bad guys in the hand to fight their battles for them. Even Rex is aware of how predictable it is, filling in G.W. Bailey's town drunk and future sidekick in on the town characters rather than vice versa while town hostess Marilu Henner and the villain's daughter Sela Ward vie for his affections and Griffith allies his traditional cowboys with railroad boss Fernando Rey's spaghetti Western bad guys who wear long raincoats even when it's 110degrees and who have better theme music than the good guys. (Leone fans will certainly recognise some of the Almeria locations.)Despite numbering Walter Hill among its producers, this is a world away from Deadwood, though it has fun with the characters' sexuality and undermines many of the absurd Code of the West rules the films it spoofs were built on. Griffith is terrific as the chief villain constantly frustrated by the inability of his minions to understand him, Bailey gives good sidekick, Jim Carter has a nice but all too brief cameo as a vicious gunfighter and Patrick Wayne has fun as a rival good guy who throws him into existential crisis by undermining his belief in his own goodness and his own heterosexuality. It's a lot of fun despite the complete absence of any rustlers, but unfortunately the DVD release is missing one scene where Rex resolve his confident heterosexuality issues as well as being devoid of any extras.",4,May the most good good guy win!,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,2438,"['Rustlers', 'Rhapsody', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'had', 'misfortune', 'be', 'made', 'cinema', 'audience', 'longer', 'existed', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'comedy', 'Western', '1985', 'spoof', 'landscape', 'having', 'moved', 'long', 'way', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'barely', 'decade', 'earlier', 'was', 'gentle', 'affectionate', 'comedy', 'Western', 'parodying', '30s', '40s', 'matinee', 'B', 'movies', 'were', 'longer', 'even', 'playing', 'TV', 'fair', 'portion', 'small', 'audience', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'lured', 'Police', 'Academy', 'director', 'Hugh', 'Wilson', 'name', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'joke', 'are', 'well', 'versed', 'Western', 'lore', 'can', 'give', 'reel', 'two', 'find', 'feet', 'unsteady', 'start', 'really', 'rather', 'delightful', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'singing', 'cowboy', 'Rex', ""O'Herlihan"", 'drifting', 'yet', 'stereotypical', 'Western', 'town', 'where', 'complain', ""n't"", 'hair', 'gin', 'where', 'power', 'mad', 'cattle', 'baron', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'thousands', 'cattle', 'hear', 'never', 'see', 'war', 'local', 'sheep', 'herders', 'who', 'smell', 'awful', 'rely', 'passing', 'strangers', 'who', 'only', 'ever', 'bad', 'guys', 'hand', 'fight', 'battles', 'Even', 'Rex', 'aware', 'how', 'predictable', 'filling', 'G.W', 'Bailey', 'town', 'drunk', 'future', 'sidekick', 'town', 'characters', 'rather', 'vice', 'versa', 'town', 'hostess', 'Marilu', 'Henner', 'villain', 'daughter', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'vie', 'affections', 'Griffith', 'allies', 'traditional', 'cowboys', 'railroad', 'boss', 'Fernando', 'Rey', 'spaghetti', 'Western', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'wear', 'long', 'raincoats', 'even', 'when', '110degrees', 'who', 'have', 'better', 'theme', 'music', 'good', 'guys', 'Leone', 'fans', 'will', 'certainly', 'recognise', 'Almeria', 'locations', 'numbering', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'producers', 'world', 'away', 'Deadwood', 'fun', 'characters', 'sexuality', 'undermines', 'many', 'absurd', 'Code', 'West', 'rules', 'films', 'were', 'built', 'Griffith', 'terrific', 'chief', 'villain', 'constantly', 'frustrated', 'inability', 'minions', 'understand', 'Bailey', 'good', 'sidekick', 'Jim', 'Carter', 'nice', 'too', 'brief', 'cameo', 'vicious', 'gunfighter', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'fun', 'rival', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'existential', 'crisis', 'undermining', 'belief', 'own', 'goodness', 'own', 'heterosexuality', 'lot', 'fun', 'complete', 'absence', 'rustlers', 'unfortunately', 'DVD', 'release', 'missing', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Rex', 'resolve', 'confident', 'heterosexuality', 'issues', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'devoid', 'extras']",Rustlers' Rhapsody VHS
214040,ARFCORBCTKX1J,6300214613,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[0, 0]","Readers should know that the version I'm reviewing runs 88 minutes, the same time given on IMDb. But it does seem to be ""missing something"", and I'm inclined to believe those reviewers who think scenes have been removed (for TV, perhaps?). It really doesn't matter, because ""RR"" quickly sinks beneath the waves five minutes after it starts.Hugh Wilson is best known as the producer of ""WKRP in Cincinnati"", a classic sitcom. (When I watched re-runs a year ago, I was pleasantly surprised that it was even better than I remembered.) He's been associated with other excellent shows, and created the outstanding ""Frank's Place"". But his movie record is decidedly checkered. Most of his films have been critically panned comedies.""RR"" tries to spoof classic B Westerns by transplanting one of their greatest stars -- Rex O'Herlihan -- into a modern color+widescreen Western. Wilson doesn't seem to know that a good story requires some sort of conflict to drive it. In this case, the most-obvious conflict would be to treat the story as a //double// fish-out-of-water tale -- Rex doesn't understand the modern-sensibilities Western he finds himself in, while that story's characters can't comprehend a singing ""good-guy"" cowboy dressed in ridiculous clothing.In the right hands, this could be very funny, with Western-movie clich&eacute;s (both old and recent) naturally colliding to great comic effect. Instead, Wilson trots out each clich&eacute;, throws it in the audience's face, then //explains// it. It never works. The low point is G W Bailey (an unappealing actor taking Jack Elam's role in ""Support Your Local Sheriff!"") screwing up a classic gag line, then //explaining// it to the audience. You've got to be kidding, Mr Wilson. (Would that he were.)The story builds to what is a terrific comic idea -- that to be a true ""good guy"", you have to be not merely a heterosexual, but a //confident// heterosexual. It never occurs to Wilson that Rex -- coming from an era of asexual cowpokes -- might not know what ""heterosexual"" means. (Throughout the film, he says he knows everything that's going to happen (in a general sort of way). How do you get humor out of that?) Nor do we see him finally gaining his ""confidence"" with the virgin hooker. (This appears to be the missing scene.)The climax -- in which all the bad guys kill each other -- is probably intended as a spoof of ""The Wild Bunch"". But it fails to provoke even the faintest snicker.Wilson's dialog is lame, labored, and logorrheic. Despite ""RR""'s relatively short running time, I found myself nodding off at several points. It's not merely tedious, but actively boring.The PG rating is absurd. The talk about sex and sexuality easily pushes ""RR"" into PG-13 territory.A terrible ""comedy"", with perhaps two (count 'em -- two) solid jokes. Not recommended -- unless you want an object lesson in how not to make a good movie.",2,This was written by Hugh Wilson?,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,2887,"['Readers', 'should', 'know', 'version', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'runs', '88', 'minutes', 'same', 'time', 'given', 'IMDb', 'seem', 'be', 'missing', 'something', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'believe', 'reviewers', 'who', 'think', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'TV', 'perhaps', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'RR', 'quickly', 'waves', 'five', 'minutes', 'starts.Hugh', 'Wilson', 'best', 'known', 'producer', 'WKRP', 'Cincinnati', 'classic', 'sitcom', 'When', 'watched', 're-runs', 'year', 'ago', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'remembered', 'been', 'associated', 'other', 'excellent', 'shows', 'created', 'outstanding', 'Frank', 'Place', 'movie', 'record', 'decidedly', 'checkered', 'Most', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'critically', 'panned', 'comedies', 'RR', 'spoof', 'classic', 'B', 'Westerns', 'transplanting', 'one', 'greatest', 'stars', 'Rex', ""O'Herlihan"", 'modern', 'color+widescreen', 'Western', 'Wilson', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'good', 'story', 'sort', 'conflict', 'drive', 'case', 'most-obvious', 'conflict', 'would', 'be', 'treat', 'story', '//double//', 'fish-out-of-water', 'tale', 'Rex', ""n't"", 'understand', 'modern-sensibilities', 'Western', 'story', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'singing', 'good-guy', 'cowboy', 'dressed', 'ridiculous', 'clothing.In', 'right', 'hands', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'Western-movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'old', 'recent', 'naturally', 'colliding', 'great', 'comic', 'effect', 'Instead', 'Wilson', 'out', 'clich', 'eacute', 'audience', 'face', 'then', 'never', 'low', 'point', 'G', 'W', 'Bailey', 'unappealing', 'actor', 'taking', 'Jack', 'Elam', 'role', 'Support', 'Your', 'Local', 'Sheriff', 'screwing', 'up', 'classic', 'gag', 'line', 'then', 'audience', ""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'kidding', 'Mr', 'Wilson', 'Would', 'were', 'story', 'what', 'terrific', 'comic', 'idea', 'be', 'true', 'good', 'guy', 'have', 'be', 'not', 'merely', 'heterosexual', '//confident//', 'heterosexual', 'never', 'Wilson', 'Rex', 'coming', 'era', 'asexual', 'cowpokes', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'heterosexual', 'means', 'film', 'everything', 'going', 'happen', 'general', 'sort', 'way', 'How', 'do', 'get', 'humor', 'do', 'see', 'finally', 'gaining', 'confidence', 'virgin', 'hooker', 'be', 'missing', 'scene', 'climax', 'bad', 'guys', 'kill', 'other', 'probably', 'intended', 'spoof', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'provoke', 'even', 'faintest', 'snicker.Wilson', 'dialog', 'lame', 'labored', 'logorrheic', 'RR', 'relatively', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'found', 'nodding', 'off', 'several', 'points', 'not', 'merely', 'tedious', 'actively', 'boring.The', 'PG', 'rating', 'absurd', 'talk', 'sex', 'sexuality', 'easily', 'RR', 'PG-13', 'territory.A', 'terrible', 'comedy', 'perhaps', 'two', 'count', ""'em"", 'two', 'solid', 'jokes', 'Not', 'recommended', 'want', 'object', 'lesson', 'how', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'movie']",Rustlers' Rhapsody VHS
