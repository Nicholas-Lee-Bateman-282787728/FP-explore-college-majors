294490,A2KZQY1VW9JDWV,6302088593,Absolem,"[0, 0]","Lucas (Corey Haim) is a spirited runt who likes bugs and classical music, and when he sees a new girl, Maggie (Kerri Green), playing tennis on an abandoned court, he likes her too, and expresses this by casually playing Waltz of the Flowers on a tape deck he carries in his backpack.They become summer friends, trekking through swamp and sewer where they talk about Keeping an Open Mind and the more Superficial aspects of high school.When the term begins several things set the mood. Lucas' friends, Ben (Ciro Poppiti), bold, brave, basketball-shaped, and Rina (Winona Ryder), quiet, boyish, and harboring a crush towards Lucas that he never notices, announce to him that their band teacher shot himself because of a broken heart which prompts several later conversations glossing over Romeo and Juliet. Less than ten minutes afterwards during a beginning of the year pep-rally-type assembly Lucas is publicly humiliated by Bruno (Tom Hodges) the Bad Football player, an insecure and abrasive second in command, though later that night at the movie theatre he is commended for being a ""good sport"" by Cappie (Charlie Sheen) the Good Football player, and his girlfriend Alise (Courtney Thorne-Smith). After being invited out after the movie by Cappie, Lucas also survives sitting in the back of Cappie's car with Spike (Jeremy Piven) and Tonto (Kevin Wixted) imp-faced Football Players who are defined by their names, rough, but too bumbling to be malicious.To Lucas' disappointment, Maggie goes out for cheerleading, and to Alise's disgust, Cappie begins spending a lot of time staring at Maggie. Cappie and Maggie become a tentative couple, and Lucas, in a desperate attempt to attract her attention, tries out for the football team - which goes about as well as you think it would for a 90lb kid appearing to be constructed of toothpicks.It's good. It's realistic. Some kids are cruel, selfish, and vulgar, but they are also sweet, vulnerable, and intelligent. High school football games are not won by miracles that occur seconds before the clock runs out, football players and cheerleaders aren't all evil Barbie and Ken dolls, and not all band and science club members are pure pictures of socially awkward innocence. All the actors, incredibly young as they were, play their parts well so the characters seem warm and three-dimensional, and appear to be people, rather than props.Five stars for one of the few movies that does not treat high school like a bad nightclub.",5,Happy Endings High School,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,2477,"['Lucas', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'spirited', 'runt', 'who', 'bugs', 'classical', 'music', 'when', 'new', 'girl', 'Maggie', 'Kerri', 'Green', 'playing', 'tennis', 'abandoned', 'court', 'too', 'casually', 'playing', 'Waltz', 'Flowers', 'tape', 'deck', 'backpack.They', 'become', 'summer', 'friends', 'trekking', 'swamp', 'sewer', 'where', 'talk', 'Keeping', 'Open', 'Mind', 'more', 'Superficial', 'aspects', 'high', 'school.When', 'term', 'several', 'things', 'set', 'mood', 'Lucas', 'friends', 'Ben', 'Ciro', 'Poppiti', 'bold', 'brave', 'basketball-shaped', 'Rina', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'quiet', 'boyish', 'harboring', 'crush', 'towards', 'Lucas', 'never', 'announce', 'band', 'teacher', 'shot', 'broken', 'heart', 'several', 'later', 'conversations', 'glossing', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Less', 'ten', 'minutes', 'afterwards', 'beginning', 'year', 'pep-rally-type', 'assembly', 'Lucas', 'publicly', 'humiliated', 'Bruno', 'Tom', 'Hodges', 'Bad', 'Football', 'player', 'insecure', 'abrasive', 'second', 'command', 'though', 'later', 'night', 'movie', 'theatre', 'commended', 'being', 'good', 'sport', 'Cappie', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Good', 'Football', 'player', 'girlfriend', 'Alise', 'Courtney', 'Thorne-Smith', 'being', 'invited', 'out', 'movie', 'Cappie', 'Lucas', 'also', 'sitting', 'back', 'Cappie', 'car', 'Spike', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Tonto', 'Kevin', 'Wixted', 'imp-faced', 'Football', 'Players', 'who', 'are', 'defined', 'names', 'rough', 'too', 'bumbling', 'be', 'malicious.To', 'Lucas', 'disappointment', 'Maggie', 'out', 'cheerleading', 'Alise', 'disgust', 'Cappie', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'staring', 'Maggie', 'Cappie', 'Maggie', 'become', 'tentative', 'couple', 'Lucas', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'attract', 'attention', 'out', 'football', 'team', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'would', '90lb', 'kid', 'appearing', 'be', 'constructed', 'toothpicks.It', 'good', 'realistic', 'kids', 'are', 'cruel', 'selfish', 'vulgar', 'are', 'also', 'sweet', 'vulnerable', 'intelligent', 'High', 'school', 'football', 'games', 'are', 'not', 'won', 'miracles', 'occur', 'seconds', 'clock', 'out', 'football', 'players', 'cheerleaders', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'evil', 'Barbie', 'Ken', 'dolls', 'not', 'band', 'science', 'club', 'members', 'are', 'pure', 'pictures', 'socially', 'awkward', 'innocence', 'actors', 'incredibly', 'young', 'were', 'play', 'parts', 'well', 'characters', 'seem', 'warm', 'three-dimensional', 'appear', 'be', 'people', 'rather', 'props.Five', 'stars', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'not', 'treat', 'high', 'school', 'bad', 'nightclub']",Lucas VHS

Why is he so beautiful?  N-E way, he is really cool in this movie which only adds to his complete and total hotness.  What I like about this movie is how confident Lucas is. He is a nerd but can he really be described as a nerd? He likes bugs and he is really smart, but he is very confident, not at all a victim, even though his life is a sad and tragic story with a absent mother and alcoholic father that is not seen but only talked about during the film. He lives in a ratty old trailer park and works for a gardner. He is bullied on a regular basis but endlessly fights back against the bullies.

He is just darned annoying when he is whining and moping for attention. It becomes easy to hate him for his selfishness. On the other hand, the film doesn't say very much. There are too many undeveloped subplots, and we are left with more questions than answers. A lot of times, Lucas is a perfect example of Bullying 101. Oddly for some reason, the movie starts out a sappy, off beat romance, then it becomes more of a drama before resorting to comedy route, and finally, it settles for a tear-jerker (if you will call it). If I were Lucas, I would have gone for Winona Ryder's character over the redheaded Goonies girl.

""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[1, 1]","Long before he was forced by obscurity and/or poverty to try selling his teeth on the Internet for cash, Corey Haim had a brief heydey in mid-1980's films.(SEE HAIM ALSO IN  ""SILVER BULLET"" AND ""THE LOST BOYS."")This charming film from writer/director David Seltzer is the best. I was delighted to find this on DVD at  Amazon,com,  and equally delighted to find, after all these years, that the movie retains all of its charm.Haim plays Lucas, a scrawny geek who doesn't fit in anywhere. He covers his pain by being goofy and outspoken. We know little of his home life. We hear his dad is ""alcoholic"" and nobody knows where his mother is.Lucas is smart and sensitive. Lucas loves insects and classical music. He soon falls in love with  Maggie (Kerri Green) the new girl in town. The two begin a touching friendship, but things change a bit once school starts. Maggie cares for Lucas, but falls for sensitive/sexy football player Cap (Charlie Sheen). Meanwhile, Lucas never notices that Rena (Winona Ryder in her film debut) has a crush on him. Instead, he joins the football team in order to prove his ""prowess"" and attractiveness to females. Lucas nearly gets himself killed, but he gains the respect of the entire school.There is one unfortunate moment in a football team locker room/shower scene where a negative term for ""gay"" (The Other ""F"" word) is used. That is unnecessary, but brief.  This is almost compensated for by the fact that, even here at age 22. Charlie Sheen is smolderingly sexy. Sheen appears in a lengthy scene  without a shirt on, and I say ""Thank You, God!"" for that. Gratuitous,  yes,  but I'm extremely grateful.You could watch this movie and play a game of ""Whatever Became Of..."" ?  as several members of the young cast, including Jeremy Piven, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Ryder, and Charlie Sheen  went on to notable careers. I think Sheen and Green appeared together in another film at the same time period titled ""THREE FOR THE ROAD"". If anybody knows where I can pick that one up, please let me know; and, does anybody know whatever happened to Kerri Green? I'd like to know. And, say what you will about his messy private life or controversial political views, Sheen is a survivor who has worked for a stable, solid career. Whatever individual fates may have befallen the cast, and the sad fact that Haim has virtually vanished off the world radar, ""LUCAS"" holds up remarkably well;  well enough, in fact, to achieve a poignant timelessness and be acknowledged as one of the ""CLASSIC"" teen films of the 1980's era.The double sided DVD includes both Full Screen and Wide-Screen presentations of the film",5,"""LUCAS"" IS  CLASSIC, CHARMING, POIGNANT TRIP BACK TO MID-1980'S TEEN CINEMA",1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,2630,"['Long', 'was', 'forced', 'obscurity', 'and/or', 'poverty', 'try', 'selling', 'teeth', 'Internet', 'cash', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'had', 'brief', 'heydey', 'mid-1980', 'films', 'SEE', 'HAIM', 'ALSO', 'IN', 'SILVER', 'BULLET', 'LOST', 'BOYS', 'charming', 'film', 'writer/director', 'David', 'Seltzer', 'best', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'com', 'equally', 'delighted', 'find', 'years', 'movie', 'charm.Haim', 'plays', 'Lucas', 'scrawny', 'geek', 'who', ""n't"", 'fit', 'anywhere', 'pain', 'being', 'goofy', 'outspoken', 'know', 'little', 'home', 'life', 'hear', 'dad', 'alcoholic', 'nobody', 'where', 'mother', 'is.Lucas', 'smart', 'sensitive', 'Lucas', 'insects', 'classical', 'music', 'soon', 'love', 'Maggie', 'Kerri', 'Green', 'new', 'girl', 'town', 'two', 'begin', 'touching', 'friendship', 'things', 'change', 'bit', 'once', 'school', 'starts', 'Maggie', 'Lucas', 'sensitive/sexy', 'football', 'player', 'Cap', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Meanwhile', 'Lucas', 'never', 'Rena', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'film', 'debut', 'crush', 'Instead', 'football', 'team', 'order', 'prove', 'prowess', 'attractiveness', 'females', 'Lucas', 'nearly', 'killed', 'gains', 'respect', 'entire', 'school.There', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'moment', 'football', 'team', 'locker', 'room/shower', 'scene', 'where', 'negative', 'term', 'gay', 'Other', 'F', 'word', 'used', 'unnecessary', 'brief', 'almost', 'compensated', 'fact', 'even', 'here', 'age', '22', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'smolderingly', 'sexy', 'Sheen', 'lengthy', 'scene', 'shirt', 'say', 'Thank', 'God', 'Gratuitous', 'yes', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'grateful.You', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'play', 'game', 'Became', 'several', 'members', 'young', 'cast', 'including', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Courtney', 'Thorne-Smith', 'Ryder', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'went', 'notable', 'careers', 'think', 'Sheen', 'Green', 'appeared', 'together', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'titled', 'THREE', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'anybody', 'where', 'can', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'please', 'let', 'know', 'anybody', 'know', 'happened', 'Kerri', 'Green', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'say', 'what', 'will', 'about', 'messy', 'private', 'life', 'controversial', 'political', 'views', 'Sheen', 'survivor', 'who', 'worked', 'stable', 'solid', 'career', 'individual', 'fates', 'may', 'have', 'befallen', 'cast', 'sad', 'fact', 'Haim', 'virtually', 'vanished', 'off', 'world', 'radar', 'LUCAS', 'up', 'remarkably', 'well', 'well', 'enough', 'fact', 'achieve', 'poignant', 'timelessness', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'one', 'CLASSIC', 'teen', 'films', '1980', 'era.The', 'double', 'sided', 'DVD', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Wide-Screen', 'presentations', 'film']",Lucas VHS

I am, however, a fan of both coming-of-age films and Corey Haim, so I was kind of hard-wired to like it.Even so, the movie was better than I expected. It seems to me that the movie description and, especially, the DVD cover are slightly misleading. Parts of the film do center around football, but it's certainly not a ""football movie."" That cover, with the ridiculous photoshopped football, was incredibly off-putting to me and probably the reason why I hadn't watched this sooner.What this movie actually is, is a smart, incredibly sweet coming-of-age story. It's a ""small"" movie, but I don't mean that as a negative. The scope is narrowed and it has a real small town, slice of life feel to it. It's an indie in the truest sense of the word, but it's one that stands the test of time. The writing is smarter than it needs to be, and it's got one of the best teen casts of the 80's. Corey Haim steals the show as the title character. Cute, funny, tragic... it's a complicated role. It's also definitely his best movie.

It was one of his best performances; thinking of it made me sad that he never found his footing as an actor during his adult years.I realize that this is supposed to be my review and not Roger Ebert's, but I can't help but quote a couple of things he said.  About Haim's performance in ""Lucas"": ""He creates one of the most three-dimensional, complicated, interesting characters of any age in any recent movie.

I don't have to tell the ones who read this that the teen movies that are made today is beyond horrible. One thing I love about the eighties, is that the directors who made teenage movies really put their hearts in it, and made an effort to capture the true luminous light of youth. I was immediately taken with &quot;Lucas&quot;, because, unlike most teen movies, intelligence and individuality were portrayed. Clever dialogue, wonderful acting, and best of all, individuality was emphasized. One thing I honestly regret about being a seventeen-year-old teenager in the millennium is having to be subjected to Hollywood teen flicks, which are so full of dreck it's amazing.

That is, until Lucas meets Maggie, a red-headed beauty who capivates his heart and soul. They become fast friends because they find each other interesting.  But Maggie is 16, light-years ahead in maturity, and she turns heads in her direction, especially a particularly handsome wide receiver (Sheen).  So there is only one thing for Lucas to do in order to ""keep"" Maggie's interest - join the foot ball team and become a football hero!  Outmatched and outweighed, Lucas struggles to find acceptance among his teammates, his coach, and the entire student body.  The three central characters, Sheen, Maggie, and Lucas, form the core of this coming of age movie that is fun, innocent, and engaging. ""What are we going to do about you, Lucas?"", says Maggie, and this forms the central theme of the film.Can a nerdy, wimpy, prepubescent bug nut find his rightful place in a world that is dominated by jocks, cheerleaders, and a social network that he has no place in?  It is well worth the 95 minutes to find out.  Teens will love this movie, and so will older folks as well, for there is a part of Lucas in all of us that we can relate to.

This movie about a young 14 year old who will do anything to impress a older girl was right on the mark.  This blu ray which looks pretty good is worth owning and very family friendly. It's a good story of teen angst and it has both touching and comedic moments.  Even today a kid could emphasize and relate to the basic story here.  The characters are played as real people and not stereotypes. It's worth owning on blu ray if you love these type of movies. Watching this close to 30 years later it's easy to see how much charisma these actors had and sadly both of them would let drugs destroy their careers (sheen could have stayed a giant movie star but by the mid 90's that prospect was gone) and they even completely destroyed Haim's health.

I realize now looking at him in contrast to the other popular kids exactly what makes a person ""well liked"" in certain situations.  Honesty and sincerity seem to not make someone popular, and if you have other interests besides being the star of the team then you're odd, and your worth is measured by something else entirely.Corey Haim, in perhaps his most famous and successful role, plays the dorky kid Lucas.  He befriends a pretty new girl in town and they become very close over the summer.  Once school starts, she begins to branch out and meet new people, including the star quarterback Charlie Sheen.  Lucas becomes naturally jealous that the gal he had developed a crush on is becoming smitten with someone else and not acknowledging his more gentile charms, and even attempts to join the football team in hopes of getting her approval.  Beaten up by the steroid ridden jocks and crushed on the field, he never gives up on his dream of someday winning her over.It's a noble thought, but now this leaves a lot of things up to questioning people's character.  When Charlie Sheen's girlfriend dumps him, he comes to Lucas's fair lady for comfort.  When Lucas shows up to take her to the school dance, she announces that she will not be going with him but taking Charlie Sheen out for pizza.  If she truly had integrity she would've forgone her love for Charlie Sheen for that one night and stuck to her obligation.  Charlie Sheen was supposed to be the reformed jock who saw what a great person Lucas really was, and he does defend him when others try to bully, but if he was really a friend he would've stepped aside and said to the dream girl that while he cares for her he doesn't want to hurt Lucas's feelings so they should put it aside.  As for Lucas, he told the dream girl that he lived on a house on the hill when he actually lives in a trailer park.  He wanted her to like him for who he was not the fact that he was a kid from a trailer park, but the bottem line was that he lied as well.

Like Lucas, I was unpopular but outgoing. Many students looked down on me because I was in special education and was considered 'stupid'. I also had a crush on a cheerleader and did everything to get her attention. And also like Lucas, my heart was crushed when she decided to date a football player. I was even told by one of the teachers to stick with my own kind (he didn't say those EXACT words, but it sounded that way) when he talked to her about me. The good news was the pain I felt healed in time.That is why I like Lucas. It is a movie I can relate to, and is full of honesty. Unlike a few other 80s teen films, it doesn't stereotype it's characters. Lucas is not a stereotypical geek because he is interesting, Cappy is not your stereotypical jock because he has a good heart and looks out for Lucas, and Maggie is not your stereotypical high school cheerleader because she doesn't act snotty.

294516,A3P6XT8Y1FEF3,6302088593,Seamus,"[2, 2]","The eighties were Hollywood's ""Golden Age"" when it comes to teen movies.  For a few years you had a string of movies featuring realistic dialog and an accurate depiction of teenage angst caused by the belief that everything matters just a bit too much.  Sure, the plots could be clich&eacute;d, but the characters and dialog were believable and nothing was too far-fetched or predictable.  Of course, all good things come to an end and now the term ""teen movie"" refers to a comedy filled with one-dimensional characters, nudity, and shock humor.  There's nothing wrong with an over-the-top comedy, but it's a shame that they've more or less wiped out the old teen dramas and coming-of-age stories.When it comes to the eighties movies it seems like the Brat Pack/John Hughes films get the most attention, but the best movie of them all was David Seltzer's ""Lucas.""Here's the basic plot:  Maggie moves to town during the summer and gets noticed by a local nerd, Lucas.  A friendship forms between them, even though he's younger, and he develops a crush on her, but things change when school starts.  It's not that she doesn't want to be his friend--but she also meets new people, and Lucas is so busy trying to be a part of Maggie's world that he doesn't even notice the advances of another girl (a young Winona Ryder).""Lucas"" is melodramatic at times, but that just makes it more realistic.  Teenagers DO tend to make everything into a life-or-death situation and they make crazy choices to get what they want.  All of the characters in this movie defy stereotypes.  Lucas isn't just nerd who can be written off--he's a sympathetic character.  But so is Maggie...and the jock football player played by Charlie Sheen.  Everyone makes tough choices due to their hormones.  It's easy to think the movie is silly at time--it's been spoofed a hundred times I think--but it's also a movie worth seeing.  It was pretty much the best thing Cory Haim or Kerri Green ever starred in.",5,My Favorite Silly 80s Movie,1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,1972,"['eighties', 'were', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'when', 'teen', 'movies', 'few', 'years', 'had', 'string', 'movies', 'featuring', 'realistic', 'dialog', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'teenage', 'angst', 'caused', 'belief', 'everything', 'matters', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Sure', 'plots', 'could', 'be', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'characters', 'dialog', 'were', 'believable', 'nothing', 'was', 'too', 'far-fetched', 'predictable', 'course', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'end', 'now', 'term', 'teen', 'movie', 'refers', 'comedy', 'filled', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'nudity', 'shock', 'humor', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'over-the-top', 'comedy', 'shame', ""'ve"", 'more', 'less', 'wiped', 'out', 'old', 'teen', 'dramas', 'coming-of-age', 'stories.When', 'eighties', 'movies', 'Brat', 'Pack/John', 'Hughes', 'films', 'get', 'most', 'attention', 'best', 'movie', 'was', 'David', 'Seltzer', 'Lucas', 'Here', 'basic', 'plot', 'Maggie', 'town', 'summer', 'noticed', 'local', 'nerd', 'Lucas', 'A', 'friendship', 'forms', 'even', 'younger', 'crush', 'things', 'change', 'when', 'school', 'not', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'friend', 'also', 'new', 'people', 'Lucas', 'so', 'busy', 'trying', 'be', 'part', 'Maggie', 'world', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'advances', 'girl', 'young', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Lucas', 'melodramatic', 'times', 'just', 'more', 'realistic', 'Teenagers', 'DO', 'tend', 'make', 'everything', 'life-or-death', 'situation', 'make', 'crazy', 'choices', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'characters', 'movie', 'defy', 'stereotypes', 'Lucas', ""n't"", 'just', 'nerd', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'written', 'off', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'so', 'Maggie', 'jock', 'football', 'player', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Everyone', 'tough', 'choices', 'due', 'hormones', 'easy', 'think', 'movie', 'silly', 'time', 'been', 'spoofed', 'hundred', 'times', 'think', 'also', 'movie', 'seeing', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'best', 'thing', 'Cory', 'Haim', 'Kerri', 'Green', 'ever', 'starred']",Lucas VHS
