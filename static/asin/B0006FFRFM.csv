865583,A3OWB7OTSJ3I7V,B0006FFRFM,B. Barnes,"[2, 2]","Wow.  That is really the only way to describe what watching this anime is like.  It was extremely morally confusing to watch, that's for sure.  Despite the ick factor naturally associated with the themes covered by Koi Kaze, the story is presented in such a tasteful, plausible way that I had a hard time watching it sometimes because of the way it made me feel.  Both characters are so likeable and act the way you could really expect someone in that situation to act that you catch yourself pulling for them every now and then.  Of course, you immediately snap back to reality and feel guilty for pulling for them.  THAT is what I like about it.  I can't think of another anime where I had to actively remind myself what right and wrong was.  It didn't change my view of incest or anything like that, it just makes you see that sometimes weird situations can happen in these days of separated families.Just about everyone has been in love or had a crush on someone that they had no way of ever being with.  Koi Kaze takes the doomed relationship theme to a whole new level without making you feel like a perv for watching it.  I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys stories about relationships and thinks they can get past the initial shock of what is going on.  The emotional roller coaster of ""will they get together or not?"" is well worth the price of admission.",5,Not as creepy as I know it sounds.,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,1374,"['Wow', 'really', 'only', 'way', 'describe', 'what', 'watching', 'anime', 'was', 'extremely', 'morally', 'confusing', 'watch', 'sure', 'ick', 'factor', 'naturally', 'associated', 'themes', 'covered', 'Koi', 'Kaze', 'story', 'presented', 'such', 'tasteful', 'plausible', 'way', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'watching', 'sometimes', 'way', 'made', 'feel', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'likeable', 'act', 'way', 'could', 'really', 'expect', 'someone', 'situation', 'act', 'catch', 'pulling', 'now', 'then', 'course', 'immediately', 'snap', 'back', 'reality', 'feel', 'guilty', 'pulling', 'what', 'like', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anime', 'where', 'had', 'actively', 'remind', 'right', 'wrong', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'view', 'incest', 'anything', 'just', 'see', 'sometimes', 'weird', 'situations', 'can', 'happen', 'days', 'separated', 'families.Just', 'everyone', 'been', 'love', 'had', 'crush', 'someone', 'had', 'way', 'ever', 'being', 'Koi', 'Kaze', 'doomed', 'relationship', 'theme', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'making', 'feel', 'perv', 'watching', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'stories', 'relationships', 'can', 'get', 'initial', 'shock', 'what', 'going', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'will', 'get', 'together', 'not', 'well', 'price', 'admission']",N/A
865584,A339D7WDJTQUN8,B0006FFRFM,"Carol Nichols ""Otaku moe!""","[1, 1]","Koi Kaze Vol. 1... whew a very unexpected story. I first heard about it while researching Patrick Seitz works. He was most famous for this one. And I should've researched the show first, but I'm glad I did't.I see the title and I'm thinking a father/daughter slice of life? Looks cool. The first moments are beautiful! The intro is sweet, gentle and peaceful. The first episode finally told me what the show was ""really"" about. What a twist, and the intro made sense too...Interestingly, this one of the few animes when I like the dub better then the sub. Don't hate, appreciate, the voices. Seitz usually does macho, obnoxious, characters. But this time is out there. He does the protagonist and captures the the essense of what he feels, making your heart race during his ""scenes"".Koshiro is a 27-year old marriage planner and seems to enjoy his life to an extent. He lives with his dad(huh?) and is mildly handsome. The anime itself is a romance anime, for the not so apparent reasons... His parents got divorced when he was 13 and suddenly his kid sister who he hardly remembers, let alone is aware, is going to move in with them to be a freshman at high school. Eh no big deal, riiiight?Nanoka is her name, and is 15 years old. Being related to Koshiro she is looking foward to meeting him for the first time. They ""meet"" actually at the end of the first episode which makes Koshiro both very happy and disgusted with himself.Koshiro's problem isn't that yet. He just broke up, and doesn't seem affected by it, at all... This actually scares him, wooried if he is actually capable of loving anyone.The first episode is one of my favorites because it brings tears to your eyes for feeling what his problem is. The solution is even scarier, than he can imagine. He meets someone who he believes is his person. NO one under the age of 18 should watch this anime! Seriously, no nudity, or violence or even blood. But it is, so far, a very good watch.The other episodes are tension builders for whats yet to come, with the last ep(the 4th) to be one of his breaking points.While the theme is something we don't see everyday:Incest.

While it is true that Koi Kaze does present the viewer with a taboo subject matter (much older brother/younger sister potential romance), it is presented in a way that seems rather innocent.  This show is definitely for mature viewers due to the nature of the storyline, but not the actual audio/video contents (no nudity, sex or even bad language or violence).  Instead of those anime regulars, we get a touching unconventional drama that has super high production values and can be enjoyed on its own as a clean fictional story.  We do not have to agree with the premise, but Koi Kaze is a strong show on its own merits, regardless.

865586,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B0006FFRFM,maskedgamer,"[2, 11]",An anime based on the idea of a 27 year old man falling in love with a 15 year old that also happens to be his sister. I don't think this anime could  have turned out well in any scenario. I didn't know what this was going to be about going into it. It was recommended to me after watching the Cl'annad series. I don't think I've ever seen a more disgusting anime than this.Watching this just makes you feel like you want to take a shower after seeing it. There's a long running joke about another grown man who wants to find young girls. If you think that's funny than you probably are already a registered sex offender.The anime starts out with a dopey 27 year old who lives at home with his father and obviously is a failure with women. He doesn't have any ambition and he doesn't have any real goals. He just works and comes home. The anime starts off with him getting dumped (can you really blame the girl?) and that's the end of the good parts about this series.After that you are introduced to a young girl the main character is attracted to and later on you find out she's his sister. The guy can't help himself but think about his sister constantly and even pleasures himself to the thought of her while sniffing some of her personal belongings. The anime is really disgusting and perverted.Trying to understand it is like trying to rationalize with a pedophile. They just don't see what their doing is wrong. The only person in the show that makes any sense is the main characters co worker and for whatever reason he's not interested in her even though she sleeps over at his apartment. He's too wrapped up in his sister. Unfortunately the only voice that makes any sense in this entire anime is made to be seen like a villain trying to ruin their love.I won't spoil this for anyone who is curious enough to watch it but I just couldn't stomach this series. Reluctantly I finished and I hope that I forget it but I probably wont because the main character is probably the most pathetic excuse for a man I have ever seen in any anime or cenima. A man so low he would basically take advantage of his own sister just so he wouldn't have to feel alone in the world. He pretty much ruined her.Enjoy if you like incest...I'm still shivering.,1,Extremely disgusting!,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,2246,"['anime', 'based', 'idea', '27', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'falling', 'love', '15', 'year', 'old', 'also', 'be', 'sister', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anime', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'well', 'scenario', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'going', 'was', 'recommended', 'watching', ""Cl'annad"", 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'more', 'disgusting', 'anime', 'this.Watching', 'just', 'feel', 'want', 'take', 'shower', 'seeing', 'long', 'running', 'joke', 'grown', 'man', 'who', 'find', 'young', 'girls', 'think', 'funny', 'probably', 'are', 'already', 'registered', 'sex', 'offender.The', 'anime', 'out', 'dopey', '27', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'home', 'father', 'obviously', 'failure', 'women', ""n't"", 'have', 'ambition', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'goals', 'just', 'home', 'anime', 'getting', 'dumped', 'can', 'really', 'blame', 'girl', 'end', 'good', 'parts', 'series.After', 'are', 'introduced', 'young', 'girl', 'main', 'character', 'attracted', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'sister', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'sister', 'constantly', 'even', 'thought', 'sniffing', 'personal', 'belongings', 'anime', 'really', 'disgusting', 'perverted.Trying', 'understand', 'trying', 'rationalize', 'pedophile', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'wrong', 'only', 'person', 'show', 'sense', 'main', 'characters', 'co', 'worker', 'reason', 'not', 'interested', 'even', 'over', 'apartment', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'sister', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'voice', 'sense', 'entire', 'anime', 'made', 'be', 'seen', 'villain', 'trying', 'ruin', 'love.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anyone', 'who', 'curious', 'enough', 'watch', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'series', 'Reluctantly', 'finished', 'hope', 'forget', 'probably', 'wont', 'main', 'character', 'probably', 'most', 'pathetic', 'excuse', 'man', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'anime', 'cenima', 'man', 'so', 'low', 'would', 'basically', 'take', 'advantage', 'own', 'sister', 'just', 'so', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'feel', 'alone', 'world', 'pretty', 'much', 'ruined', 'her.Enjoy', 'like', 'incest', ""'m"", 'still', 'shivering']",N/A

Smith,"[1, 1]","I've watched all three volumes of this anime for the second time, and I must say it's for not just the Serious Anime fan, but for anyone who is a lover of fine drama, because despite the very mature and controversial subject matter, this is one excellent, well written drama. Nanoka is mature beyond her years as is evident when she goes toe to toe with Chidori. She very often acts like the older sibling here. She knows what is happening and handles situations and confrontations much better than Koshiro.A risky proposition for a series or drama? You bet. And the ending was not what I expected. Not at all. Bottom line with this one is you will either love it or detest it. In my opinion, it needs to be watched with no preconceived notions going into it (which I know can be difficult for some).

865588,A1PY83VL3VJ1FV,B0006FFRFM,Sacred Dust,"[1, 1]","Koi Kaze is a charming, unsettling and poignant anime about an unusual brother/sister relationship. The main character, Koshiro, has a much younger sister (he's 27, she's 15) whom he hasn't seen in years. They finally meet again as the show starts, but don't recognize each other at first, and there are some vague but tangible romantic feelings between them. So when Koshiro finds out who Nanoka really is--and that she's moving in with him and his father--he's presented with an obvious emotional dilemma.This may sound like a disturbing and inappropriate show to many viewers, but it's not really like that at all. Koi Kaze does not sugar-coat or hide from its subject matter, but it does present it tastefully. Most of the characters seem like real (and likable) people whom the audience can identify with. While some well-timed comic relief is used to lighten the tension between Koshiro and Nanoka, the show stays grounded in reality, even as the relationship gets increasingly ambiguous and conflicted.And that is probably for the best--because stuff like this can and does happen, whether we are comfortable with it or not. I think it's encouraging that at least one show is willing to really explore such issues.There are also many other things to like about Koi Kaze. While the animation itself is pretty good, the artwork (pre-drawn backgrounds, freeze-frames, interludes and such) is stunning. The music is mostly tender and understated, exactly what was needed to back up the story. The Japanese voice acting is quite good, and shockingly, even the English voices are decent.

Koi Kaze is different than any other Anime I've yet seen.  Many romantic Anime DO feature some kind of taboo love or lust (inter-generational, student-teacher, multiple-partner, twins, whatever), but those are almost always unmistakably in the spirit of romantic or sexual FANTASY.  In those Anime, the shallowness of the characters and the general silliness of the situations could never let you think of it as more than this.  If the fantasy appeals to you, then you enjoy it.But Koi Kaze is not really a fantasy.  Or if it *is* a fantasy, then it is a fantasy gone horribly awry, one that fails to suspend the relevant laws of nature... those consequences and ramifications that proceed from forbidden relationships.  Indeed, Koi Kaze is full of consequences and ramifications, emotional and social.  There is no guilt-free sex or anything like that here.  (Indeed, as someone else mentioned, there is no nudity at all, and there is only one kiss.)Having said that, I want to make one more point:  Like ""tbug_v8eater"" said, this could have been made as a live-action drama.  However, you should not mistake this for a ""Lifetime-Special-Dealing-With-An-Important-Problem"".  What I mean is that -- like most Anime girls -- the high-school girl in Koi Kaze is HIGHLY DESIRABLE.  So it does not require any effort for you to understand the brother's lust, because you feel it yourself.  Perhaps ""American Beauty"" would be the closest live-action analog.

865590,A13CJVFZGEZP0H,B0006FFRFM,"Thomas Lent ""tbug_v8eater""","[30, 31]","Psychologists refer to it as ""Genetic Sexual Attraction"" and this series investigates it from the first-person point of view.  Many Anime/Manga stories have had hints of incestuous relationships for comedic or even to heighten the erotic tension of a pornographic tale.  Koi Kaze, on the other hand, looks at the emotional end of the bargain.  Most of the characters are genuinely plain and unattractive.  As far as I know, there isn't a single frame of fanservice.  All that's left is a disturbingly human story of forbidden love.This is a series that could have been acted out in live action but I'm sure something would have been lost in that context.  What's presented here is just enough of a slice-of-life series to keep the characters in the realm of reality, yet artistically askew enough to allow the viewer the illusion of safety in the believe that it is not ""actually"" happening.  The seemingly watercolored backgrounds almost give a sense of unrolling an old silk story scroll and the animation is just enough to bring it to life.In the end, I'm left depressed and a bit uncomfortable with the humanity of it all.  Koshiro, the male lead, is a man who has truly hit rock bottom.  He has reached the point where he's so indifferent to the people around him that he even treats his (ex)girlfriend like a stranger.  Yet, for a moment, the bright eyes of a young girl help him to see that it is actually spring time.  Problem being; it's those same eyes that lead to a much greater downfall in the story to come.More often than not, it's stories like this that make me appreciate Japanese Animation so much.  Through simplistic artwork a subtle characters comes an emotional intensity that can't be matched by any level of violence or noise that the mainsream often delivers.There might not be much room for a story like this in the American market.  The faint of heart and anyone from the ""moral"" right should steer clear.  But, for anyone else open minded enough to accept a bitter dose of reality.
