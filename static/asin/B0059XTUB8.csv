It's no wonder Williams' was nominated for an Academy Award for My Week with Marilyn. Michelle Williams has really impressed me with the last few films she has done, like Blue Valentine, Brokeback Mountain, etc. but it's her knockout role as Marilyn Monroe that really proves that Williams is a gifted actress, and it's so funny she got her start on that silly show Dawson's Creek! Kenneth Brannagh is fabulous as well as Sir Laurence Oliver.

The former Dawson's Creek star has come into her own, and her feature film career of late has proven her to be an indie movie darling, with acclaimed roles in films like Wendy and Lucy and Blue Valentine. Her latest is a turn as iconic starlet Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn, a profile of the week she spent with filmmaker Colin Clark, fresh out of college on his first movie gig as an assistant director to Sir Laurence Olivier on 1957's The Prince and the Showgirl. The nuanced portrayal of the Hollywood legend earned Williams her third Oscar nomination, and Kenneth Branagh earned his second for acting, though neither took home the statue.

1450915,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B0059XTUB8,Amit Talpade,"[0, 1]","The year is 1956, and the author Colin Clark, on whose book the movie is based on is trying to find a job, which he does on the the sets of a Laurence Olivier production, ` The Prince and the Showgirl' starring the most famous woman on the planet, the diva Marilyn Monroe. As expected, this dream pairing is a disaster, Olivier, trying to be a star and Marilyn trying to be an actor. Olivier, a genius is frustrated by the clumsy, neurotic and needy Marilyn along with conflicts between English stage acting and the new acting method followed by Marilyn, the Strasberg school. This is witnessed by the young Clark, who like the rest of the world sucumbs and vies of the charms of the drug dependant Monroe. He forms a friendship, love which lasts a week much to the displeasure of all of Monroe's handlers. Eventually, against the advice of everyone he falls in love with Marilyn and gets his heart broken, probably appreciating the lesson that  Laurence Olivier had learned: ""When it comes to women, you're never too old for humiliation.""My week with Marilyn does not add to the legend of Monroe but is a showcase of her charm and genius on camera. As Clark tells her, ""Olivier is a great actor who wants to be a film star, and you're a film star who wants to be a great actor. This film won't help either of you"" The rest of the cast is great and perform well. Julia Ormond is perfect as Olivier's wife, who tries to cope with her own aging and loss of desirability. Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as the caustic, short tempered Olivier, who is both enamored and repulsed by Monroe. The moments when he realizes that he would never match Monroe's charisma on screen are indeed worth watching.Michelle Williams is once again is fine form as she effortlessly matches the childlike innocence, vulnerability and nerves that was Monroe.

1450917,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0059XTUB8,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I remember when this film was released.  All the major complaints filtering in where that the film felt too much like a `made for television' movie and not a theatrical picture.  I can't say that that isn't the case, because this film just doesn't really feel like a movie.  That doesn't mean that this film isn't entertaining, because it is (and a large part of that is thanks to Kenneth Branagh), but at the end of the day it also feels a tad empty and it certainly doesn't say a whole lot about any of the figures depicted, Monroe included.  It tries to break into the fragile creature that flirted with the world and hid her pain with a mask of sensuality, but it doesn't quite succeed.  Instead it merely serves as a series of sequences that allow the actors to deliver fun dialog and recreate moments from 1957's `The Prince and the Showgirl'.`My Week With Marilyn' centers on a young man named Colin who desperately wants to break into the movies.  He gets his chance after a chance meeting with Laurence Olivier and a little determination lands him the third directors assistant position on the production of `The Prince and the Showgirl'.  Through non-judgmental eyes he watches Marilyn and Olivier clash over acting styles, and he watches the world fall apart under the spell of greatness; Monroe.Michelle Williams tried to snag an Oscar for her portrayal of Monroe, and she probably came closer than some think.  Mimicry is something the Academy salivates over, and Williams surpasses expectations with her layered portrayal of the complicated movie star.  She doesn't exactly mirror her in the way that Streep mirrored Thatcher (which is probably why Streep won the Oscar, and not Williams) but she infuses the common perception of her with something special.  It's just a shame that the film doesn't give her enough substance.  It pretends to, and from outward appearance it may, but when one digs a little deeper there isn't much here.  As special as Williams is, it really is Branagh who steals the show.  He nails Olivier's frantic obsession with Monroe and his jilted perception of his own talents and future.  He furrows his brow and clenches his teeth and ann-un-ci-ates with pitch perfect command of the character.And so, we are left with a fun little film that gets some right and leaves a lot to be desired.  With the prospects of deeper insight, I'm saddened that this film didn't do more to make Monroe feel real and alive, outside of a spirited performance by the film's lead.  The ending feels tacked on, and the apparent impact that Monroe had on all involved feels lost on the audience because her antics always feel laced with mere fluff.  Maybe the film is just too short to produce any genuineness, and then again, maybe the script is just too concerned with other things.",3,A week isn't enough to make this stick...,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,2803,"['remember', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'major', 'complaints', 'filtering', 'where', 'film', 'felt', 'too', 'much', 'made', 'television', 'movie', 'not', 'theatrical', 'picture', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'case', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'movie', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'large', 'part', 'thanks', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'end', 'day', 'also', 'tad', 'empty', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'say', 'whole', 'lot', 'figures', 'depicted', 'Monroe', 'included', 'break', 'fragile', 'creature', 'flirted', 'world', 'hid', 'pain', 'mask', 'sensuality', ""n't"", 'quite', 'succeed', 'Instead', 'merely', 'series', 'sequences', 'allow', 'actors', 'deliver', 'fun', 'dialog', 'recreate', 'moments', '1957', 'Prince', ""Showgirl'."", 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'centers', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Colin', 'who', 'desperately', 'break', 'movies', 'chance', 'chance', 'meeting', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'little', 'determination', 'third', 'directors', 'assistant', 'position', 'production', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'non-judgmental', 'eyes', 'Marilyn', 'Olivier', 'clash', 'acting', 'styles', 'world', 'fall', 'apart', 'spell', 'greatness', 'Monroe.Michelle', 'Williams', 'tried', 'snag', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Monroe', 'probably', 'came', 'closer', 'think', 'Mimicry', 'something', 'Academy', 'Williams', 'surpasses', 'expectations', 'layered', 'portrayal', 'complicated', 'movie', 'star', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'mirror', 'way', 'Streep', 'mirrored', 'Thatcher', 'probably', 'why', 'Streep', 'won', 'Oscar', 'not', 'Williams', 'common', 'perception', 'something', 'special', 'just', 'shame', 'film', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'substance', 'outward', 'appearance', 'may', 'when', 'one', 'little', 'deeper', ""n't"", 'much', 'here', 'As', 'special', 'Williams', 'really', 'Branagh', 'who', 'show', 'Olivier', 'frantic', 'obsession', 'Monroe', 'jilted', 'perception', 'own', 'talents', 'future', 'brow', 'teeth', 'ann-un-ci-ates', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'command', 'character.And', 'so', 'are', 'left', 'fun', 'little', 'film', 'right', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'prospects', 'deeper', 'insight', ""'m"", 'saddened', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'make', 'Monroe', 'feel', 'real', 'alive', 'spirited', 'performance', 'film', 'lead', 'ending', 'feels', 'tacked', 'apparent', 'impact', 'Monroe', 'had', 'involved', 'feels', 'lost', 'audience', 'antics', 'always', 'feel', 'laced', 'mere', 'fluff', 'Maybe', 'film', 'just', 'too', 'short', 'produce', 'genuineness', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'script', 'just', 'too', 'concerned', 'other', 'things']",My Week with Marilyn
1450918,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0059XTUB8,Andy Orrock,"[0, 1]","This enjoyable movie captures the dichotomy of Marilyn Monroe: worshiped to near-hysteria in the public, insecure to the state of near-paralysis in private.  What better way to encapsulate the jarring juxtaposition of those two ill-fitting half-lives than by adapting Colin Clark's fascinating memoir for the big screen. Clark's tale would seem almost Melvin Dummar-esque in its 'truthiness' were it not for this fact: it's the truth.  Clark's recounting of his brief, unexpected role in Monroe's brief, ultimately tragic life during the filming of 1956'sThe Prince and the Showgirlseems the stuff of fantasy.  That Clark released it only in 1995 (under the titleThe Prince, the Showgirl, and Me: Six Months on the Set With Marilyn and Oliviersome 40 years after its unfolding gives one a clear indication of how dear this memory must have remained to his heart. The movie brings across the sense of wonder and serendipity that he must have felt as these events fell into his lap.And who better to capture that feeling than Eddie Redmayne - fresh-faced, eager, brimming with action and yet-unsullied innocence. He's perfect for the role.  As noted by others, Michelle Williams - beautiful in real-life but no one's first thought as a va-va-voom blonde in the curvy Monroe mold - undergoes a physical impressive transformation here to inhabit the very bones and spirit of one of the world's most iconographic women.  I recommend seeingWendy and Lucyto see Williams au natural to get a good idea how afield Monroe is for her physically.  Impressive stuff.There's a treasure trove of other actors here in juicy, sometimes smaller, roles: Kenneth Branagh (so different here than in 'Wallender') as Laurence Olivier; Julia Ormond (who I'd put in every movie) as his then-wife, Vivian Leigh; Dame Judy Dench as co-star Dame Sybil Thorndike; Emma Watson as Lucy, a co-worker and romantic interest for Redmayne's character; and Dominic Cooper (see him inThe Devil's Double!) as Milton Greene, co-owner (with the actress) of her production company.  Plus, a little Jim Carter for us Downton fans.

1450921,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B0059XTUB8,barry,"[1, 2]","When the making and casting of MY WEEK WITH MARILYN was announced there was much debate over the casting of Michelle Williams as Marilyn.  Marilyn Monroe who if you really study her film work was a very good actress is instead remembered moreso for the amazing aura about her.  She represented sexuality, sensuality, innocence, vulnerabilty all at the same time with an incomparable beauty and presence never seen since.  So people with this film were basing the casting on who looked more like Marilyn.  Luckily that is not how the producers of the film proceeded for it is the inner essence of Marilyn that made her who she was and a great actress is needed for that.  And today in film there is no greater actress than Michelle Williams.They did a very good job in making her look like Marilyn but Williams went so much deeper and made her performance in no way a mere caricature.  She tapped into the pure soul and spirit of what was Marilyn.  The film takes place over a brief period when Marilyn was filming THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL.  This was a film when she was on husband # 3, Arthur Miller and sadly she didn't have much longer to live.  The film in and of itself is a pretty simple story.  The acting is very good all around but it plays as a slice of life piece except for the performance of Michelle Williams.  When she made her first appearance in the film I was comparing her to Marilyn but as the film went on I totally stopped and when the film was over it stayed on my mind for days.  I am a huge fan of both Marilyn and Michelle.  I knew the full back story of Marilyn at the time of the film and I found the performance of Williams haunted me long after viewing the film.I really felt as if I had spent time with Marilyn Monroe.  Williams totally tapped into the insecurity, vulnerabilty, innocence and aura that was Marilyn.  She became her.  Repeat viewings of this film also help to see the greatness of her performance for Marilyn is such a strong presence that it may be understandably difficult to belive anyone portraying her.  There has never been a portrayal of Marilyn that captured her true purity and powerful presence as with Michelle Williams.  I cannot recommend this film enough.  Marilyn and Michelle got their deserved praise by this film.

I fully expected this to be a rather predictable, shallow tale that would ultimately be embraced only by the most die hard fans of this iconic film legend.

The 2011 Academy Award nominated film 'Marilyn' is a thoughtful, introspective and nostalgic film that can be thoroughly appreciated whether you are a fan or not.

You could change all the characters to fictitious people and it would still be a great film.Indeed one of the top films of 2011, the Academy got it right this time!",5,"""Thanks For Being On My Side"" ~ Seeing Marilyn For The First Time?",1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,786,"['Given', 'fact', 'have', 'never', 'considered', 'be', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'fan', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'fully', 'expected', 'be', 'rather', 'predictable', 'shallow', 'tale', 'would', 'ultimately', 'be', 'embraced', 'only', 'most', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'iconic', 'film', 'legend', 'However', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', '2011', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'film', ""'Marilyn"", 'thoughtful', 'introspective', 'nostalgic', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'appreciated', 'are', 'fan', 'not', 'Even', 'more', 'surprising', 'story-line', 'so', 'strong', 'compelling', 'own', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'real', 'person', 'could', 'change', 'characters', 'fictitious', 'people', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'great', 'film.Indeed', 'one', 'top', 'films', '2011', 'Academy', 'got', 'right', 'time']",My Week with Marilyn

This movie took too much of a sympathetic perspective of Marilyn Monroe.  2.  Michelle Williams is a very good actress - borderline excellent - which makes her too good to play Marilyn.  Ms. Monroe never bothered to learn her craft as an actress (watch ""Seven Year Itch"" if you disagree with me, or even ""Some Like it Hot"" where she was strictly a prop to the far superior Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis) so Ms. Williams had to downgrade her skills here, which was obviously difficult for her to do.Before you get too excited about negative comments about Ms. Monroe, I have read a book or two about her so I know most of the basics.  As someone in this film says to the third-string director at one point, ""Stay away my boy.  Otherwise, you will get burned,"" when talking about any relationship with Monroe.  Indeed.  From what I have read this was a common refrain; many men were left in her wake, to risk mixing metaphors.It's too bad Marilyn died so young, but not for the reasons that most people believe.  Time is unkind to everyone, and it would have been particularly unkind to her.  People would have gotten the opportunity to see the real Marilyn Monroe, and I don't believe that they would have necessarily liked what they saw.  The rose-colored glasses surely would have fallen off.Naturally, a terrific performance here by Ms. Williams, nonetheless.  And a very good movie in the sense that it wasn't afraid to have most of the movie set around Ms. Monroe's work, and those that strongly disliked here.

I don't know if it was her acting talents or lack of, her beauty, her portrayed innocence, her sexuality or many other qualities, but the thing is, we can't have enough of her. A lot has been written about her and her sad and misunderstood life, and the exquisite ""My week with Marilyn"" gives us a charming and honest look at Marilyn's character in some detailPerhaps the best way to describe what this film is all about is by quoting the paragraph that opens it: ""In 1956 Marilyn Monroe went to England to make a film with Laurence Olivier. She met Colin Clark, who wrote a diary about the making of the film."" Colin Clark was a well-to-do young man who wanted to make it in show business, and for that purpose he went to Laurence Olivier's (Kenneth Branagh) production office on a daily basis, in order that he could be hired. His insistence paid off and Olivier hired him as third assistant director on the film ""The Sleeping Prince."" His position basically was that of an errand way, which he accepted and worked very hard at it. The star of the film, in addition to Olivier - who  also directed --, was Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams), who arrived to England with her then husband, writer Arthur Miller.During the filming of the movie, Monroe was problematic, and it was driving Olivier insane, with, her coming late to the set, her insecurities, her constant auto medication, her troubles with her husband, and the presence of her controlling acting coach. Olivier was at one point advised to ""try to accept her in her own terms to avoid problems. Trying to change her would drive him crazy."" To the rescue came Colin, who, for some reason Marilyn got attached to, and became her confidant. This relationship would affect the completion of the film, and would change Colin's life forever.""My week with Marilyn"" is kind of a coming of age film - at least for Colin --, but it also gives us an intimate look at Marilyn's persona, and how tormented she was. And, despite all this, she had the gift of stealing people's hearts, as well as a special kind of charisma on the screen. Judy Dench, who plays actress Sybil Thorndike, said it best, when she told Colin that ""first love is such sweet despair."" The film, which was later called ""The Prince and the Showgirl,"" was done before the successful ""Some like it hot.""  Needless to say, Michelle Williams was nominated for an Oscar for her amazing portrayal of Marilyn Monroe, and Kenneth Branagh was nominated for his portrayal of Laurence Olivier.

I suppose I am like those people who stare at car crash scenes or crashed plane sites.  It is that kind of sensation.  And although this movie has many lovely moments, every time Marilyn is on screen, we are aware of such a potential crash scene waiting in the wings. Michelle Williams thus well deserves her Oscar nomination for capturing a period in her life wherein she still had fleeting moments of happiness but most of the time could feel disaster closing in on her.This is set in England while she was making PRINCE AND THE SHOW GIRL with Olivier. It is not one of her better movies although she is the best thing in it.  The problem in it was the massive ego of Larry Olivier and having that ego at the helm of the production as director. Monroe needed to be coddled through a film by a director with a handkerchief at the ready and a deep well of patience.  Olivier had neither. Colin, a young man who is third assistant director on the film helps take care of her while she is filming. Most of the time she is the Marilyn who is right at the edge of coming apart but she is still able to be delightful for brief periods and especially with this young man who is still an innocent compared to these vultures in the film industry.Kenneth Branagh also does an excellent job playing Olivier and brings a great deal of humor to the film as he plays him so broadly at points that you are sure he is satirizing him. Branagh was an unexpected delight in this role.Williams looks uncannily like Monroe and I think she accomplishes this with some fairly simple tactics.  One, rather than being overly made up, which is what is usually done by those playing her, Williams instead goes for capturing the looks she was more famous for in her stills when she was a lot more natural looking. Two, Williams really worked on her voice and body movements and captured them very well.  We actually identify people every bit as much by those expressive motions and she nailed them.There isn't much plot here.  It is simply getting this picture made so she can be off.  We are so fascinated by her that any more plot would probably just get in the way.",4,Compulsively Watchable Marilyn,1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,2221,"['time', 'tune', 'film', 'Monroe', 'find', 'unable', 'look', 'away', 'suppose', 'am', 'people', 'who', 'stare', 'car', 'crash', 'scenes', 'crashed', 'plane', 'sites', 'kind', 'sensation', 'movie', 'many', 'lovely', 'moments', 'time', 'Marilyn', 'screen', 'are', 'aware', 'such', 'potential', 'crash', 'scene', 'waiting', 'wings', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'thus', 'well', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'capturing', 'period', 'life', 'wherein', 'still', 'had', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'happiness', 'most', 'time', 'could', 'feel', 'disaster', 'closing', 'her.This', 'set', 'England', 'was', 'making', 'PRINCE', 'THE', 'SHOW', 'GIRL', 'Olivier', 'not', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'best', 'thing', 'problem', 'was', 'massive', 'ego', 'Larry', 'Olivier', 'having', 'ego', 'helm', 'production', 'director', 'Monroe', 'needed', 'be', 'coddled', 'film', 'director', 'handkerchief', 'ready', 'deep', 'well', 'patience', 'Olivier', 'had', 'Colin', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'third', 'assistant', 'director', 'film', 'take', 'care', 'filming', 'Most', 'time', 'Marilyn', 'who', 'right', 'edge', 'coming', 'apart', 'still', 'able', 'be', 'delightful', 'brief', 'periods', 'especially', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'innocent', 'compared', 'vultures', 'film', 'industry.Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'also', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'Olivier', 'great', 'deal', 'humor', 'film', 'so', 'broadly', 'points', 'are', 'sure', 'satirizing', 'Branagh', 'was', 'unexpected', 'delight', 'role.Williams', 'uncannily', 'like', 'Monroe', 'think', 'fairly', 'simple', 'tactics', 'One', 'rather', 'being', 'overly', 'made', 'up', 'what', 'usually', 'done', 'playing', 'Williams', 'instead', 'capturing', 'looks', 'was', 'more', 'famous', 'stills', 'when', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'natural', 'looking', 'Two', 'Williams', 'really', 'worked', 'voice', 'body', 'movements', 'captured', 'very', 'well', 'actually', 'identify', 'people', 'bit', 'much', 'expressive', 'motions', 'nailed', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'here', 'simply', 'getting', 'picture', 'made', 'can', 'be', 'off', 'are', 'so', 'fascinated', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'probably', 'just', 'get', 'way']",My Week with Marilyn

About 15 minutes in you stop feeling that Marilyn Monroe doesn't look quite like herself and begin to believe you are watching the actual actress making a movie about herself. Michelle Williams disappears into Marilyn Monroe. The same can't be said for Kenneth Branagh as Sir Laurence Olivier. In fact, it took a bit of confusion before I realized who he was supposed to be (not quite as much with Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh). For a while they were just ""Larry and Vivien"" and I had no idea they were supposed to be portraying famous actors.Another point of confusion was the R rating for this movie. I banished my 11-year-old from the room lest she see a lot of nudity or sexual situations. Instead I found the movie had no violence, very little sex past kissing and a skinny dipping scene where the audience got only the briefest view of someone's backside, and no nudity accept the aforementioned backside. I can only assume the use of the ""F"" word on one or two occasions elicited this R rating, because nothing else seemed to more than PG-13.The movie itself was fascinating, engaging and never dull, if only for the behind the scenes portrayals of some very famous people.

1450932,AB34G6VKP28L,B0059XTUB8,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[0, 1]","Based on the recent memoirs of a filmmaker and producer, My Week With Marilyn follows a budding romance surrounding one of the most difficult film shoots of Marilyn Monroe's career.Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) has always wanted to be involved in movies, and he is determined enough to stick around the executive studios until he is hired as a 3rd assistant director to Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh). The world-renowned stage actor is preparing to direct and star in a movie opposite the beautiful Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams), but has little idea of what he is in for. Marilyn proves deeply insecure, temperamental, is frequently late to the sound stage, and fusses at the drop of a hat. Laurence is at the end of his rope, but Colin has more compassion for the American diva, who is newly married and in spite of her global success, deeply unhappy.Circumstances throw them together and a friendship sparks that threatens Colin's attempts to woo one of the costume girls (Emma Watson). But as the shoot continues, he finds in Marilyn a young woman in a gilded cage, longing for freedom but without the courage to reach out and take it with both hands.This film relies on impersonations of actors that everyone is familiar with -- from Laurence Olivier to his wife, Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormand). It seems strange to me then that none of the actors involved bear any resemblance to their cinematic counterparts, much less attempt in any way to impersonate them. I've heard glowing reviews of everyone involved but there was never a moment when I was convinced Branagh was Olivier, Ormand was Leigh, or Williams was Marilyn. None of them even bothered to alter their voice that much, which meant that element of the film was sorely missing. That aside, it is quite a wonderful period piece, full of gorgeous costumes and a cast that doesn't go ten minutes without introducing someone well known to costume drama fans. From Derek Jacobi to Michael Kitchen, it is not short on talent.What the movie meant to convey and what it wound up revealing are two different things, but I often found myself frustrated with Marilyn and I'm not sure that is the emotion I was meant to have. The musical score is lovely and the script is fluid.

Certainly there have been plenty more stable actresses. But there has never, in the history of film or TV, been any other actress who was more magnetic; who was more ""made"" for the medium than Marylin Monroe. Even in the earliest role I've seen her in, ""All About Eve"", she manages to capture and hold the audience like no one before or since. She really was the physical embodiment of the term ""star power"". She was also, according to most people who worked with her, somewhat challenging at times, and it's both aspects of her that come to play in this movie.The movie stars Michelle Williams who channels Marylin expertly, playing her as she comes to England to film a movie with Lawrence Olivier, played by noted actor/director Kenneth Branagh. She's somewhat difficult to work with, which is like saying light moves a little speedily. Eventually she acquires/chooses a handler in the form of young third assistant director, Colin, played by Eddie Redmayne. The two bond and start to become close. Very close.This was a really excellent movie. Williams embodied Marylin in all respects, right down to being so blinding on screen that her mere presence almost washed-out every other person in the frame. Everyone else does well with their roles, too, including Redmayne, who has a very daunting task playing against Williams.The only complaint I can really level about the film is that the pacing felt a bit off. It dragged in places. Not severely so, but enough that I was checking the clock a few times.That aside, this is a wonderful movie, and I highly recommend viewing it and reading Tony Curtis' book, ""The Making of Some Like it Hot,"" which also details much about Marylin and her life and personality.",4,The mystery of Marylin,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,1789,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'other', 'actress', 'Others', 'who', 'were', 'better', 'looking', 'More', 'talented', 'Certainly', 'have', 'been', 'plenty', 'more', 'stable', 'actresses', 'never', 'history', 'film', 'TV', 'been', 'other', 'actress', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'magnetic', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'made', 'medium', 'Marylin', 'Monroe', 'Even', 'earliest', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Eve', 'capture', 'hold', 'audience', 'one', 'before', 'really', 'was', 'physical', 'embodiment', 'term', 'star', 'power', 'was', 'also', 'according', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'somewhat', 'challenging', 'times', 'aspects', 'come', 'play', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'stars', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'who', 'channels', 'Marylin', 'expertly', 'playing', 'England', 'film', 'movie', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'played', 'noted', 'actor/director', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'work', 'saying', 'light', 'moves', 'little', 'speedily', 'Eventually', 'handler', 'form', 'young', 'third', 'assistant', 'director', 'Colin', 'played', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'two', 'bond', 'start', 'become', 'close', 'Very', 'close.This', 'was', 'really', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Williams', 'embodied', 'Marylin', 'respects', 'right', 'down', 'being', 'so', 'blinding', 'screen', 'mere', 'presence', 'almost', 'washed-out', 'other', 'person', 'frame', 'Everyone', 'else', 'well', 'roles', 'too', 'including', 'Redmayne', 'who', 'very', 'daunting', 'task', 'playing', 'Williams.The', 'only', 'complaint', 'can', 'really', 'level', 'film', 'pacing', 'felt', 'bit', 'off', 'dragged', 'places', 'Not', 'severely', 'so', 'was', 'checking', 'clock', 'few', 'aside', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'reading', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'book', 'Making', 'Hot', 'also', 'details', 'much', 'Marylin', 'life', 'personality']",My Week with Marilyn

Michelle Williams plays off-screen Marilyn as a lost little girl; Williams' performance as on-screen Marilyn also seems spot on. It's easy to see where her Oscar nomination came from!

Eddie Redmayne did a fine job as Colin Clark, the film assistant whose relationship with Marilyn is the basis for the film; however, the character of Colin wasn't very likable (which is odd, considering the film is based on Clark's memoirs), and that diminished my enjoyment of the film.The special features are rather lean--a commentary track and a 19-minute ""making of"" documentary.

Through a series of coincidences, Colin becomes 3rd Assistant Director to The Prince and the Showgirl.  From there his youth and innocences continues to land him in unusual circumstances - namely the brief sparking friendship and romance to Marilyn Monroe.Michelle Williams' performance as Marilyn Monroe is amazing, as many point out.  Williams' Monroe is spot on with her hushed breath voice and large batting eyelashes.  This particular Marilyn performance outlines her erradic behavoir and troubled life, but mostly focuses on her duel life style mentality - the child-like free spirit and the overwhelmed mega star blinded in the spotlight.  And in here, the viewers finally feel sympathy for the always changing Monroe.But be assured that this movie is more than that.  The perephial performances are equally notched and carry the story.  We see Kenneth Branagh in wonderful performance as Laurence Olivier; his heavy-handed fist perfected film making is in stark contrast to Monroe's method.  Emma Watson's performance was surprisingly fresh and untethered to her Harry Potter past.The story itself does focus on just a very narrow time period, giving the sense of urgency and fine detail that most biopics avoid.  This film is geunine and designed to give the viewer a sense of the author's original voyage.  In this film, we are Colin.  As the time passes, we both love and adore Marilyn only to have the week come to an abrupt end.  We feel like the days are passing too fast and the opportunity is not being appreciated enough.  In this narrow window of time, we not only see a believable Monroe but experience a believable encounter with such a legendary persona.For those that enjoy the star, her films, biographies, or based on true stories - this is highly recommended.",5,A Glimpse Through the Window to Marilyn's Life,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,1846,"['story', 'young', 'man', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'Colin', 'series', 'coincidences', 'Colin', '3rd', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'youth', 'innocences', 'land', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'namely', 'brief', 'sparking', 'friendship', 'romance', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe.Michelle', 'Williams', 'performance', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'amazing', 'many', 'point', 'out', 'Williams', 'Monroe', 'spot', 'hushed', 'breath', 'voice', 'large', 'batting', 'eyelashes', 'particular', 'Marilyn', 'performance', 'erradic', 'behavoir', 'troubled', 'life', 'mostly', 'duel', 'life', 'style', 'mentality', 'child-like', 'free', 'spirit', 'overwhelmed', 'mega', 'star', 'blinded', 'spotlight', 'here', 'viewers', 'finally', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'always', 'changing', 'Monroe.But', 'be', 'assured', 'movie', 'more', 'perephial', 'performances', 'are', 'equally', 'notched', 'carry', 'story', 'see', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'heavy-handed', 'fist', 'perfected', 'film', 'making', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Monroe', 'method', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'performance', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'fresh', 'untethered', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'past.The', 'story', 'focus', 'just', 'very', 'narrow', 'time', 'period', 'giving', 'sense', 'urgency', 'fine', 'detail', 'most', 'biopics', 'avoid', 'film', 'geunine', 'designed', 'give', 'viewer', 'sense', 'author', 'original', 'voyage', 'film', 'are', 'Colin', 'time', 'passes', 'love', 'adore', 'Marilyn', 'only', 'have', 'week', 'come', 'abrupt', 'end', 'feel', 'days', 'are', 'passing', 'too', 'fast', 'opportunity', 'not', 'being', 'appreciated', 'enough', 'narrow', 'window', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'believable', 'Monroe', 'experience', 'believable', 'encounter', 'legendary', 'persona.For', 'enjoy', 'star', 'films', 'biographies', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'highly', 'recommended']",My Week with Marilyn

Michelle Williams is excellent as Monroe but for me one of the best things about the movie was the who's who roster of English actors, Brannagh as Olivier, Judi Dench is also present, as it Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh (I believe she's French but she's appeared in many English productions and some American ones).  Michael Kitchen who is best known for the series ""Foyle's War"" is wonderful as is Zoe Wanamaker one of my all time favorite character actors, you'll recognize her from many, many BBC productions, in ""Marilyn"" she plays Paula Strasberg, Marilyn's acting coach and unofficial therapist.  Emma Watson who gained fame playing Hermione in the ""Harry Potter"" films also appears as Colin's would be girlfriend.  Eddie Redmayne is Colin Clark the young man who's diary the film was based on.  Redmayne is a face I didn't recognize but he's the epitome of a wide eyed, enthusiastic, fresh faced young man, the perfect foil for Marilyn's antics.  There was one scene when they return to Colin's alma mater, Eton, and as the two of them descend a staircase into a crowd of assorted Etonian students, teachers, cooks, and janitors, Marilyn turns to Colin and whispers in her vapory voice, ""Shall I be her?""  With that she sways her hips, purses her lips and poses seductively for her audience.  Michelle Williams transforms herself into Marilyn.  She captures Marilyn's vulnerability, her mood changes, her drug and alcohol use as well as her dream of being recognized as a great actress.  There was a scene from the film they're supposedly filming ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" where Marilyn is all by herself in a scene, she's humming and prancing around, both the dance and the song performed sotto voce, that was magic.  Michelle Williams disappears almost completely in these scenes, her personality is wiped clean and all you see is Monroe.

Marilyn, played by Michelle Williams, goes to make a movie with Laurence Olivier in England. Colin Clark, a man in his early twenties from a rich family, dreams of being in the movie-making business and lands a job working with Laurence Olivier. As the movie films, Marilyn is unsure of herself as she tries to be a real actress and has the potential to ruin the film. As Colin spends time with Marilyn, he sees glimpses of the real girl behind the blonde bombshell veneer and that life is not perfect for her, the story of which, is well-known.I think that Michelle did a wonderful job as Marilyn. You can tell that she must have studied hours and hours of film to get Marilyn's mannerisms and speech patterns right. I sometimes forgot that I was watching an actress playing Marilyn Monroe. Judi Dench was perfect, as usual, as Dame Sybil Thorndyke. I liked that they gave a good supporter of Marilyn besides Colin. I kind of wish that she was in the film more. Kenneth Branagh was quite amazing as Kenneth Branagh. He did so well in the role. On the other hand, I completely disagree with the choice of Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh. As a huge fan of Ms. Leigh's, I couldn't really see any facial resemblance or voice resemblance between the two. There had to have been a better actress to play that role. That part was rather distracting and took me out of the film slightly.I really liked the movie. It was beautifully filmed as well.

""My Week With Marilyn"" pretty much follows that philosophy.  It's not an all encompassing bio of Monroe but a snapshot of the actress at an important juncture in her life.  Set in England in the mid Fifties Monroe wants to eschew her sexpot image and be taken seriously as an actress by starring in Laurence Olivier's ""The Prince and the Showgirl"".  Sensitive to the demands of Sir Larry Marilyn forms a platonic bond with a third director named Colin Clark to get through the shoot.  Michelle Williams eerily channels Monroe that you are spellbound by her performance.  Though she is not as voluptuous as Monroe Williams captures the essence of the woman humanizing instead of idolizing her.  Kenneth Branagh effectively captures the vanity and tempestuousness of Olivier and still making him a sympathetic character.  Eddie Redmayne as Colin perfectly acts as a conduit to the movie star world.  Good supporting work is offered By Judi Dench as a grand dame of the theatre, Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh, and Emma Watson in a grown-up role as a craftsperson on the set.

I went to see it with a couple friends, without any prior knowledge of or interest in Marilyn Monroe's films or life, and didn't feel that I came away with much more of either.

Jenkins,"[0, 0]","Having admired Marilyn since my boyhood (my Dad took me to see Bus Stop in a movie theater,) I'll confess, as I think most men of a certain age will, to having held a small soft spot in my heart for this gifted and wounded young woman... for my entire adult life.I'm a fairly serious student of film. I work in the theatre business. In that light I can only say that I have never seen an actress so completely transform herself into another human being as Ms. Williams does in this film.Whether one is a fan of Marilyn or not, she is in our collective DNA, an incomparable and central icon of our national culture to this day. We know her every expression, every intonation, every eyelash. For an actress to take on such a role must have been a daunting task.Many actresses have played Marilyn over the years. Michelle Williams IS Marilyn. In this deeply moving film it's as though Marilyn has come back and inhabited Ms. Williams, and I choose that word very carefully.You'll perhaps go into this film expecting a light hearted romp. You'll get much more than you bargained for.One of the most astonishing performances by an actress that I've ever had the pleasure and the fully absorbed and riveted experience of watching.",5,A Simply Stunning Performance.

1450946,A3NF0H730HCE0W,B0059XTUB8,"Deanna in Cali ""DJ""","[32, 43]","First off, I tip my hat to Michelle Williams.  She gave a valiant effort in trying to pull off an icon, but she only got it 50% right.  What she DID nail was Marilyn's emotions: vulnerablility, insecurity, brokeness, and need to be loved.  She painted a beautiful picture of wounded woman.  Where she missed the mark big-time was in not nailing the charisma, sex appeal, bombshell MOVIE STAR quality that men were captivated by and women wanted to attain.  Sorry, but Ms. Wiliams, as good of an actress as she is, simply lacks the glamour, punch and va-va-voom flair of an old Hollywood starlet.  This was like casting Anne Hathaway to play Elizabeth Taylor - just wouldn't work.  When playing someone famous, simply being a good actor won't do - you have to have at least *some* of the essence of the person being emulated.  Marilyn was lost in her internal drama a lot of the time, but she knew how turn it on and sell the showgirl image for the cameras.  Williams seemed to just be growing through the motions and looked painfully uncomfortable in any scene where Marilyn had to be ""on"".  You get the sense that she's a painfully shy/quiet person and couldn't turn up the personality enough notches to be believable as a 50's movie star.  This is where finding an actress who had a background in musical theater would have made a world of difference.  [No one knows how to ""sell it"" better than a Broadway actress!].The poor casting continued with Julia Ormond [laughably] as Vivien Leigh.  Nothing, and I mean NOTHING about Ormond's looks and performance remotely resembled the icon america came to know and love as Scarlett O'Hara.The only saving grace acting-wise is Kenneth Branaugh who nailed Sir Lawrence Oliver down to the very last crisply-accentuated syllable.  Well done!  Dougray Scott was pretty good as Arthur Miller, but [sadly] was not in many scenes.Performances aside, the movie was slow, predictable, dull and felt inauthentic.",2,"'A' for effort, but decidedly lackluster",1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,1948,"['First', 'tip', 'hat', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'gave', 'valiant', 'effort', 'trying', 'pull', 'off', 'icon', 'only', 'got', '50', '%', 'right', 'What', 'DID', 'nail', 'was', 'Marilyn', 'emotions', 'vulnerablility', 'insecurity', 'brokeness', 'need', 'be', 'loved', 'painted', 'beautiful', 'picture', 'wounded', 'woman', 'Where', 'missed', 'mark', 'big-time', 'was', 'not', 'nailing', 'charisma', 'sex', 'appeal', 'bombshell', 'MOVIE', 'STAR', 'quality', 'men', 'were', 'captivated', 'women', 'wanted', 'attain', 'Sorry', 'Ms.', 'Wiliams', 'good', 'actress', 'simply', 'glamour', 'punch', 'va-va-voom', 'flair', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'starlet', 'was', 'casting', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'play', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'When', 'playing', 'someone', 'famous', 'simply', 'being', 'good', 'actor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'have', 'have', 'least', '*some*', 'essence', 'person', 'being', 'emulated', 'Marilyn', 'was', 'lost', 'internal', 'drama', 'lot', 'time', 'knew', 'how', 'turn', 'sell', 'showgirl', 'image', 'cameras', 'Williams', 'seemed', 'just', 'be', 'growing', 'motions', 'looked', 'painfully', 'uncomfortable', 'scene', 'where', 'Marilyn', 'had', 'be', 'get', 'sense', 'painfully', 'shy/quiet', 'person', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'up', 'personality', 'enough', 'notches', 'be', 'believable', '50', 'movie', 'star', 'where', 'finding', 'actress', 'who', 'had', 'background', 'musical', 'theater', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'world', 'difference', 'one', 'how', 'sell', 'better', 'Broadway', 'actress', ']', '.The', 'poor', 'casting', 'continued', 'Julia', 'Ormond', '[', 'laughably', ']', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'Nothing', 'mean', 'NOTHING', 'Ormond', 'looks', 'performance', 'remotely', 'resembled', 'icon', 'america', 'came', 'know', 'love', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara.The"", 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'acting-wise', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', 'who', 'nailed', 'Sir', 'Lawrence', 'Oliver', 'down', 'very', 'last', 'crisply-accentuated', 'syllable', 'Well', 'done', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Arthur', 'Miller', '[', 'sadly', ']', 'was', 'not', 'many', 'scenes.Performances', 'aside', 'movie', 'was', 'slow', 'predictable', 'dull', 'felt', 'inauthentic']",My Week with Marilyn
1450947,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B0059XTUB8,Deborah Earle,"[0, 1]","Director Simon Curtis has gifted us with the intimate profile of the pop icon--a tale highly reminiscent of a similar 50s era saga, ""My Favorite Year"", presented through the eyes of a young Englishman beginning his own remarkable journey.Our inaugural view of Marilyn Monroe is during a scene of her giving a performance of her classic show tunes, courtesy of Michelle Williams in her formidable Oscar-nominated, Golden Globe winning effort. It has not been lost on me that the father of Williams' child was a blond actor who was found dead and nude in his bed after a drug overdose, just like Marilyn, and perhaps Ms. Williams considered this role to be somewhat therapeutic.Watching her onscreen is young Colin Clark(Britain's ""It"" Boy of the moment, Eddie Redmayne)the odd-man out in a prominent British family of high achievers. Despite opposition from his father (Pip Torrens), the soon-to-be- 24-year-old seeks a position with Laurence Olivier Productions at Pinewood Studios, where his idol and family friend, Olivier( a sublime Kenneth Branagh, who fulfills the prediction of his being Olivier's successor by, barring the difference in height and eye color, capturing Britain's most formidable thespian of the 20th century almost completely to the life) works.After many days of sitting on the couch of the office waiting room, Olivier offers Colin a promised position on a film at the urging of his wife, Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond). Colin becomes the 3rd assistant director on a film Olivier is directing, tentatively titled, ""The Sleeping Prince"", which would later be revealed to the world as ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" (1957). As he learns his job, Colin becomes acquainted with such luminaries as a generous Dame Sybil Thorndike( Judi Dench), and begins a romance with a reluctant but savvy wardrobe girl named Lucy Armstrong(an intelligent post-Harry Potter era Emma Watson), which will be interrupted by the celebrated arrival of Marilyn and her husband of only three weeks, playwright Arthur Miller(Dougray Scott). Toby Jones, Marilyn's publicist, is among the journalists who speak with them and the Oliviers at a subsequent press conference, in which Marilyn gives her legendary guileless quips, a hallmark of her public persona.Colin secures a house for the couple to stay in, therein which will take place more drama than any on the script. He will be present during the tempestuous disagreement between the newlywed Millers, which results in Miller going home to see his children in the States. Marilyn's people, including Method Acting pioneer, Paula Strassberg(Zoe Wannamaker), and her co-production manager , Milton Greene(Dominic Cooper) are there to reassure her, and will have to continue to do so during a filming session as troubled as the star herself.Characteristically, Marilyn shows up late during the initial read-through of the script, and Colin and Dame Sybil will be the only ones who are sympathetic to her. Olivier, who at one point insults Marilyn by telling her to ""just look sexy"" when he expresses difficulty in portraying her character, Elsie Marina, will find her even more difficult to work with as a result of that.When he was supposed to have been on a date with Lucy, Colin is summoned to Marilyn's house to give her his perspective on the shoot, since he can see all sides of the situation. They have a drink and a walk in the garden before Marilyn must answer her husband's long-distance call, and the bodyguard sees Colin out.Greene confronts Colin about visiting Marilyn at her house, warning him that he will be just another brief fling for her as he once was. To Greene's ire, Colin dismisses his advice.Lucy expresses her hurt at having been stood up by Colin. In the meantime, Vivien Leigh, who had originated the part of Elsie onstage, becomes emotional at seeing the filmed footage of Marilyn in her former role and does not wish her husband well in his dealings with Marilyn.There are charming moments on the set, such as the filming of ""Elsie"" rehearsing her chorus girl number.But their one day off from work, Greene's admonishments for Colin about only having a professional relationship with Marilyn fall by the wayside, and Colin is seen getting into a car in which Marilyn is hiding under a blanket, wishing to take him on an adventure to the strains on Nat King Cole's contemporary tune, ""You Stepped Out of a Dream"".After a fleeting moment of wandering in a park, light of heart and fancy free, they travel to Windsor Castle at Colin's suggestion, where they are warmly greeted by the Castle's Librarian, Colin's godfather, Sir Owen Mooreshead(Derek Jacobi). Marilyn admires a picture book with the works of Hans Holbein, and then views the royal dollhouse, during which her personal longing for the idyllic family life she never had is expressed in her conversation. Well wishers applaud having the star in their midst after the tour.Their next stop is Colin's alma mater, Eaton, where, upon learning that the penalty for idleness is whipping, the star warns the young men crowding around her to work hard to avoid that fate, evoking a cheeky response by one of the students.Ironically, given her behavior, Olivier may have felt like whipping her given her frequent tardiness and ill preparation for her own job, although at one point he does express his admiration for Marilyn, given how tough an actress had to be to achieve her level of fame.Before the outing ends, Colin finds himself living la vida loca with the star as she takes an illicit skinny dip in a pond, and they share a kiss. As they travel home for the evening, Marilyn's countenance is wistful and the strains of Nat King Cole's ""Autumn Leaves"" sum up the mood perfectly.Colin will tend to the ill and emotionally needy star, whose frequently erratic behavior may have been a sign of the mental illness that resulted in her own mother's being institutionalized, through overdoses, and her first miscarriage before the shoot is over. An apologetic Marilyn will leave the set escorted by her sycophantic followers, but personally thank the up-and-coming young film producer in the presence of the pop-eyed pub keeper(Jim Carter) who had been skeptical of Colin's association with the star.Indeed, it was quite a week and quite an emotional roller coaster for the young man with a promising future.Bypassing the tragedy of the star's premature demise, the film focuses on the subsequent successes of Olivier, Monroe, and Clark, the last of whom left the world with an account of the Hollywood legend that he chose to remember joyously.",5,"Marilyn, the Method, and the Madness",1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,6573,"['Director', 'Simon', 'Curtis', 'gifted', 'intimate', 'profile', 'pop', 'icon', 'tale', 'highly', 'reminiscent',

1450948,A2EW488NG24I5H,B0059XTUB8,Deeper Into Movies,"[1, 1]","There are movie stars, and there are Movie Stars. For ten short years, few shone as bright as Marilyn Monroe's. In the fifties and early sixties, she was every American man's dream girl, from presidents to princes. She might have been the quintessential female star of the Hollywood sound era, a pinup Greta Garbo in living, luscious color.You won't need to be a fan (or a man) to fall in love with ""My Week with Marilyn,"" which features some of the best performances of 2011. In a role that would scare off scores of actresses, Michelle Williams is nearly spot-on as the once-plain Norma Jeane.At the height of her fame in 1956, Monroe traveled to Olde England to make ""The Prince and the Showgirl,"" directed by none other than Laurence Olivier, the regal grand man of the British stage and screen. During brief intermissions in the troubled production, the 30-year-old Monroe struck up an unlikely friendship (and perhaps more) with Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), a lowly assistant director not unexpectedly dazzled by the blonde bombshell.Clark's 1995 memoir (""The Prince, the Showgirl and Me"") was followed by ""My Week with Marilyn"" in 2000, and those few days have been translated with taste and movie-loving brio by director Simon Curtis and screenwriter Adrian Hodges. Unlike the exploitative handling of Monroe before and after her tragic death in 1962, Curtis, Williams and company have fleshed out the person behind the one-dimensional star image: insecure, innocent, frightened, and mercurial--as well as a heavenly vision of beauty and sensuality....--------Full review now playing at ""Deeper Into Movies - The Current (and Classic) Cinema"" [...]) and on Facebook.",4,"Marilyn, We Hardly Knew Ye",1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,1675,"['are', 'movie', 'stars', 'are', 'Movie', 'Stars', 'ten', 'short', 'years', 'few', 'shone', 'as', 'bright', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'fifties', 'early', 'sixties', 'was', 'American', 'man', 'dream', 'girl', 'presidents', 'princes', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'quintessential', 'female', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'sound', 'era', 'pinup', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'living', 'luscious', 'color.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'fan', 'man', 'fall', 'love', 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'best', 'performances', '2011', 'role', 'would', 'scare', 'off', 'scores', 'actresses', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'nearly', 'spot-on', 'once-plain', 'Norma', 'Jeane.At', 'height', 'fame', '1956', 'Monroe', 'traveled', 'Olde', 'England', 'make', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'directed', 'none', 'other', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'regal', 'grand', 'man', 'British', 'stage', 'screen', 'brief', 'intermissions', 'troubled', 'production', '30-year-old', 'Monroe', 'struck', 'up', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'perhaps', 'more', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'lowly', 'assistant', 'director', 'not', 'unexpectedly', 'dazzled', 'blonde', 'bombshell.Clark', '1995', 'memoir', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'Me', 'was', 'followed', 'Week', 'Marilyn', '2000', 'few', 'days', 'have', 'been', 'translated', 'taste', 'movie-loving', 'brio', 'director', 'Simon', 'Curtis', 'screenwriter', 'Adrian', 'Hodges', 'exploitative', 'handling', 'Monroe', 'tragic', 'death', '1962', 'Curtis', 'Williams', 'company', 'have', 'fleshed', 'out', 'person', 'one-dimensional', 'star', 'image', 'insecure', 'innocent', 'frightened', 'mercurial', 'as', 'well', 'heavenly', 'vision', 'beauty', 'sensuality', 'Full', 'review', 'now', 'playing', 'Deeper', 'Into', 'Movies', 'Current', 'Classic', 'Cinema', '[', ']', 'Facebook']",My Week with Marilyn

But will i be able to?After all, we're talking about a movie telling the story of a famous and important shoot and film, and of a few major American and British Icons making it!Let me start with:This film is not apparently so bad,per se: it is simply another one of those UK period productions, backed also by some American money,rich of exquisite visuals,gorgeous sets,extraordinary gowns, some real interesting upcoming actors and accomplished Stars,and a lavish,if anonymous, direction with colors, good pacing,sex,humor,drama,and even a bit of mystery,to serve such a nostalgic mix.It reminds me actually of another UK,even slightly bigger budgeted, production,also with a huge cast like Julie Christie,Romola Garai,Eddy Redmayne,Jeremy Northam and Bill Nighy among others,""Glorious 39"". Well,that was, at least, trying hard to scare us with a fine Hitchcokian's plot and to present an unsettling twist,talking about 'appeasement' a subject matter,often way overlooked!But this movie is sadly the triumph of superficiality!I'd read the nostalgic, tragic book when it first came out(It feels yesterday but it was the late Spring of 1996!),never thought it was a masterpiece,yet maybe, one more way of digging into Monroe's endlessly moneymaking's source of Iconic stories.But,at least,the novel was a real report of a conflict between 2 great actors: Monroe and Olivier,fighting horribly each other's on the set of the gracefully sophisticated comedy ""The Prince and the Showgirl""(1957)a very elegant and beautifully photographed(by another master: Jack Cardiff!!) Film,which had apparently a very sad shoot.And at least, everyone felt real,even though,saying nothing new about the 2 great minds of these 2 great Icons,everyone was well depicted,and the shoot well remembered! It took almost 4 months to complete that film in London,and Warner Bros. was not too happy to hear that Monroe was often ill,or tragically lonely and unable to cope with reality,and go on with her acting job,while sir Olivier(who was also making a huge mistake by directing the lovely Terence Rattingan's play,instead of leaving that, to a more experienced comedic film director) was getting increasingly annoyed by his co-star,her rebellious streak, and her more vivid and natural way of acting(and photographing so exceptionally in any film,while not looking ""all that"" impressive on set: but that's film, and not Stage!).Olivier apparently even tried to boycott her(but it may be gossip!),however,Marilyn,this time,and for the first time so much more than ever,was struggling a huge series of fears,and all by herself,trying desperately to please Olivier,the Studio,her manager and partner,Milton Greene(here just a cliche'role superficially played by Dominic Cooper)and even his, not so honest,but,super snob wife, Amy, who instead of being a friend to Monroe, soon became a judge(..and with which merits?)like feeling herself free to interfere with Monroe's performance.The Greene's had decided back in 1954,that MM was divine(too good of them!) ,but that 20th Century Fox(her well known main studio) was ruining her career!So, They convinced Monroe to strike against Fox, move to NYC,going to the Actor's Studio,along with Brando,Dean,Clift,Newman and so on, and changing her look into an absolutely very refined and more intellectual type of Blonde,photographed only by masters like Cecil Beaton and Richard Avedon,while asking for better pictures and bigger salaries!Not all of this was wrong,at all! And,in fact, her next picture became the best Monroe's film ever,the lovely,touching ""Bus Stop""(1956),presenting Monroe,just gorgeous but with a whole new depth and Look!However all of this in a ""A Week with Marilyn""(And,why a week? More like 17 weeks!!lol)becomes so superficially bland that The Inquire by comparison, may be,all of a sudden,a very profound publication,as well.Marilyn was also trying to 'proof' herself with that film, to her new radical activist and greatest intellectual play writer Arthur Miller,whom she'd just married,leaving the World, completely confused. And,by admiring Olivier's wife,was trying to pleasing her also,and we're talking of course,about 'that Vivien Leigh',from ""Gone with the Wind"" lol also another tragic character, and alone wife of Olivier,which befriended somewhat Amy Greene,starting to looking down at Monroe and at her natural talent,like a too easy short cut for becoming such a superstar! And,while Monroe's NYC Actor's Studio faithful coaches(Paula and Lee Strasberg) were also for a while in London, trying to help Marilyn out,were seemingly instead,only there to be truly creating even more tensions and more tensions with Olivier who just loathed the 'Method'.What a situation,uh? It might be as well the outline for a novel by Scott Fitzgerald or at least, from Edith Wharton,or David Leavitt,but this film takes on all the most shallow, predictable cliches,degrading (sorry but it really does!) some of the most important and most unforgettable Icons of the 20th Century,with suc a light script,way too light,way too 'insensitive' and lacking any depth for such material!It miscasts Dominic Cooper,Wanamaker(as Paula Strasberg),Dougray Scott(as a laughable Miller!)Ormond as Leigh (C'mon!) and even Kenneth Branagh,who seems to have a hard time in playing what he normally plays best: Olivier! The only good scenes are those with Judy Dench(playing cordial supporting fellow actress Sybil Thorndike,a real Queen of the London's stage, who'd played the Queen Dowager in""The Prince and the showgirl"" a true gem then.. and now!) and the excellent and handsome Eddy Redmayne(the real lead) becoming more infatuated and more infatuated with Monroe's presence and loneliness,while she seems here to leading him on.And,now,Let me just say: Sorry, Michelle Williams!I loved her in a few things..like the betrayed housewife in ""Brokeback Mountain""or as the desperate working class woman in last year's splendid ""Blue Valentine"",where she was brave and strong,and real,but she has just not the beauty necessary,nor the sensibility and finesse of one of the most emblematic and mysteriously tragic Icons of the 20th Century,who happens also to be,by the way,one of the most recognizable Faces on this Planet,even today!What else to say?It's annoying because Williams not only is terribly miscast,and not sexy,not attractive (Hey, Does anyone remember Marilyn's fantastic,formidable,unique posture??)but what bothers especially is that she does not even try to be looking fragile here,but just a spoiled,often drunk movie star,living through this empty plot by almost giving the impression to be vile and arrogant!I cannot forgive Williams for having NOT, at least,tried, to understand Monroe(it is always clear that she's miles away from the real Marilyn and her pain, But she is number 1 in accomplishing, and for the first time ever, a true dehumanization of one of the most moving American Tragedies,by acting always so unavailable to portray a personal anguish,pain and distress,which is truly all too bad,considering also that the strong make up effects and perfect reconstruction of some of Monroe's classic gowns are so out of place on Williams, to make her look,at times,just seriously laughable!)And so, while the film goes literally nowhere,dragging from a cliche' to the next,sadly creating some of the most ridiculous Portraits of famous Icons ever seen on East or West, to becoming just a sad,missed occasion for,at least, giving a more honest,more decent motion picture about one of the most gorgeous,tormented Ladies in Films and History,but just revealing instead little interest,and picking up like when it creates some time for hot Redmayne, to become something like the hot young idealistic stud trying to defend the poor 'Beauty' from the backstabbers,but, only because attracted and led on, even sexually, by her! This was not in the Book, at all!And it's in bad taste!The two were always very distant, and barely exchanged a few words!!!A simply ridiculous turn out,almost offensive, and,Williams,please,choose your roles with sense,as you've done so far... Marilyn is way out of your league: and it shows painfully!So this may be one of those cases where a decently filmed movie is so wrong and vile to becoming a terribly dreadful movie, that I would like not to be watched by anyone, especially by those not aware of the Truth, like younger audiences,who should have been given, instead,a way more real,moral and much more different portrait of someone like Monroe, and her struggles,her people and her Times... Those were not Paris Hilton or Kardashian's Years, those were times were People still had high Ideals and Principles,and,when, Struggling for Fame, meant struggling for Art and Respect!",2,"Michelle Williams as MM: NO and NO,and..

My critiques of films rely almost solely upon how entertained I was.  I believe I have an eye for what is good on-screen, although I can't really pick things apart to discern if a thing was off, such as the direction.  That being said, I could not have been more captivated watching Michelle Williams portrayal of the different facets of the iconic Marilyn Monroe.  It's not really that she looks like her--I don't really think that she does--but more that she embodies the role with such grace and nuance as to shed light on Marilyn's evolving personalities so unselfconsciously that one suspends disbelief while watching her play the seductive temptress, the insecure woman-child, and the lonely and lost soul who's reaching out for anyone or anything that might save her.  She does all this with humor, candor, honesty, and most importantly, immense compassion and empathy for her subject.  Michelle's performance made me look again at Marilyn, an endeavor I started with the stunning release last year of the collection of her writings, ""Fragments"".The supporting cast here is amazing.  Kenneth Branagh as Olivier is a revelation.  Again, I could not have imagined him in that role, but he is absolute perfection as Olivier.  Judi Dench brings her usual emotional weight and sweetness to her portrayal of Dame Sybil Thorndike, and Eddie Redmayne is pitch perfect as the besotted Colin, who wrote the book detailing his time with MM.I cannot say enough good about this movie.  For people fascinated with movies, Marilyn, or just the trappings of the human heart, this movie is a wonder.  Michelle Williams is the main reason.  I found that, as with Monroe, one's eyes stay glued to her in every frame in which she appears--in fact, I actually missed her when she was not on the screen.  She gives a star-making performance that may well garner her the Oscar, in my estimation.  It will certainly be a game changer for her pick of roles...she'll never be seen the same way again after the due she's paid Marilyn in this wonderful treat of a movie.",5,"50 years later, Marilyn lives and breathes again...",1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,2113,"['First', ""'m"", 'movie', 'lover', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'critic', 'critiques', 'films', 'rely', 'almost', 'solely', 'how', 'entertained', 'was', 'believe', 'have', 'eye', 'what', 'good', 'on-screen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'pick', 'things', 'apart', 'discern', 'thing', 'was', 'off', 'such', 'direction', 'being', 'said', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'captivated', 'watching', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'portrayal', 'different', 'facets', 'iconic', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'not', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'more', 'role', 'such', 'grace', 'nuance', 'shed', 'light', 'Marilyn', 'evolving', 'personalities', 'so', 'unselfconsciously', 'one', 'disbelief', 'watching', 'play', 'seductive', 'temptress', 'insecure', 'woman-child', 'lonely', 'lost', 'soul', 'who', 'reaching', 'out', 'anyone', 'anything', 'might', 'save', 'humor', 'candor', 'honesty', 'most', 'importantly', 'immense', 'compassion', 'empathy', 'subject', 'Michelle', 'performance', 'made', 'look', 'again', 'Marilyn', 'endeavor', 'started', 'stunning', 'release', 'last', 'year', 'collection', 'writings', 'Fragments', '.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'here', 'amazing', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Olivier', 'revelation', 'Again', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'imagined', 'role', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'Olivier', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'usual', 'emotional', 'weight', 'sweetness', 'portrayal', 'Dame', 'Sybil', 'Thorndike', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'besotted', 'Colin', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'detailing', 'time', 'MM.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'movie', 'people', 'fascinated', 'movies', 'Marilyn', 'just', 'trappings', 'human', 'heart', 'movie', 'wonder', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'main', 'reason', 'found', 'that', 'Monroe', 'one', 'eyes', 'stay', 'glued', 'frame', 'fact', 'actually', 'missed', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'screen', 'star-making', 'performance', 'may', 'well', 'garner', 'Oscar', 'estimation', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'game', 'changer', 'pick', 'roles', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'due', 'paid', 'Marilyn', 'wonderful', 'treat', 'movie']",My Week with Marilyn

1450953,A3ODVYRIERNB4O,B0059XTUB8,D. Marvin,"[0, 0]","Okay, so the film doesn't take place in Hollywood but it does tell the story of a young man's time with an icon who was unmistakably Hollywood: Ms. Marilyn Monroe. This is an interesting film that is elevated by the fact that it is not another paint-by-numbers biopic but a film focusing on a relatively unknown protagonist whose biggest achievement is writing the novel upon which this film is based. And rather than covering his lifetime (or Marilyn's, for that matter), it encapsulates only the brief period of time in which Marilyn flew to England to star in actor/director Sir Laurence Olivier's ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" (during the prime of her career). The film's aim is to let us inside the mind of one of the most compelling and mysterious figures in showbiz history. This is not easy but the movie is incredibly effective by doing just that. We learn just how talented she could be onscreen when she put her mind to it and how maddening it could be attempt to capture that talent on celluloid. We are keyed in to her many quirks and numerous problems in her personal life.While Michelle Williams is never really able to disappear into the role of Monroe the way that Foxx captured Ray Charles or Blanchett nailed down Hepburn, asking her to do so would be a virtually impossible task. The performance she captures, however, was well worth the Oscar nomination she received. Kenneth Branaugh, playing his own idol Laurence Olivier, is absolutely brilliant & hilarious with many scene-stealing moments. Model-turned-actor Eddie Redmayne as our young protagonist is more than serviceable and this is the type of role that leads to bigger ones down the road. The authenticity of this film is what makes it what it is. And the fact that the quality of the film as a whole manages to exceed the performance of the extremely talented Williams speaks volumes about its script, direction and supporting cast.

Dixon ""hyper-observant""","[0, 0]","Most people would say Marilyn Monroe is synonymous with sexuality, but for me it was definitely all about her ability to draw you in and suspend you in her special magic where all else seemed to dim and fade away.  Somehow all the baggage one's collected and all the weight on one's shoulders can just fade away in captivation of the star singing ""I want to be loved by you alone, Boop-boop-a-doop, boop-boop-a-doop!"", ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"", and ""Happy Birthday, Mr President.""  Although Michelle Williams was awarded the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy Motion Picture and earned Best Actress nominations from the Academy Awards and British Academy Film Awards, for me she just didn't shine like a star but many other actors and aspects ofMy Week With Marilyndid starshine and transport me into that special magic making it an enjoyable and memorable movie to view.The cinematography and costumes were wonderful transporting me to 1957 London including locations such as Saltwood Castle and Windsor Castle.  Many of the actors in the film did exude the same special Marilyn magic star quality including Eddie Redmayne.  Eddie Redmayne gave a fascinating performance in this movie speaking volumes with a mere expression and for me, he is the one who carries this movie depecting the week in which Monroe spent time being escorted around London by him.  Judi Dench also carried the movie by exuding the Marilyn special magic in her role as Dame Sybil Thorndike.  Julia Ormand and Emma Watson also shone and delivered the Marilyn magic to the viewer.  The American Film Institute in 1999 ranked Marilyn Monroe as the sixth greatest female star of all time.  While Williams does not demonstrate that quality of stardom or specialness and magic of Marilyn Monroe,My Week With Marilyndid deliver transporting the viewer back into that special magic with the combined efforts of Redmayne, Dench, Ormand, Watson, costumes, cinematography, and  script.  By watching this one movie, one can taste again the specialness of that one star that shone so bright and was snuffed out too soon.Says Clark of his week with Marilyn, ""here's what I remember most:  her embrace, her belief in me, and the joy she gave; that was her gift.  When I think of her now, I think of that time when a dream came true and my only talent was not to close my eyes.""",4,"That special Marilyn Monroe Magic is seen in cinematography, costumes, script and several character roles",1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,2367,"['Most', 'people', 'would', 'say', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'synonymous', 'sexuality', 'was', 'definitely', 'ability', 'draw', 'suspend', 'special', 'magic', 'where', 'else', 'seemed', 'dim', 'fade', 'away', 'Somehow', 'baggage', 'one', 'collected', 'weight', 'one', 'shoulders', 'can', 'just', 'fade', 'away', 'captivation', 'star', 'singing', 'want', 'be', 'loved', 'alone', 'Boop-boop-a-doop', 'boop-boop-a-doop', 'Diamonds', 'are', 'Girl', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'Mr', 'President', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'was', 'awarded', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Musical', 'Comedy', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'earned', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nominations', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'British', 'Academy', 'Film', 'Awards', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'shine', 'star', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'aspects', 'ofMy', 'Week', 'Marilyndid', 'starshine', 'transport', 'special', 'magic', 'making', 'enjoyable', 'memorable', 'movie', 'view.The', 'cinematography', 'costumes', 'were', 'wonderful', 'transporting', '1957', 'London', 'including', 'locations', 'such', 'Saltwood', 'Castle', 'Windsor', 'Castle', 'Many', 'actors', 'film', 'did', 'exude', 'same', 'special', 'Marilyn', 'magic', 'star', 'quality', 'including', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'gave', 'fascinating', 'performance', 'movie', 'speaking', 'volumes', 'mere', 'expression', 'one', 'who', 'movie', 'depecting', 'week', 'Monroe', 'spent', 'time', 'being', 'escorted', 'London', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'also', 'carried', 'movie', 'exuding', 'Marilyn', 'special', 'magic', 'role', 'Dame', 'Sybil', 'Thorndike', 'Julia', 'Ormand', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'also', 'shone', 'delivered', 'Marilyn', 'magic', 'viewer', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', '1999', 'ranked', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'sixth', 'greatest', 'female', 'star', 'time', 'Williams', 'not', 'demonstrate', 'quality', 'stardom', 'specialness', 'magic', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'My', 'Week', 'Marilyndid', 'deliver', 'transporting', 'viewer', 'back', 'special', 'magic', 'combined', 'efforts', 'Redmayne', 'Dench', 'Ormand', 'Watson', 'costumes', 'cinematography', 'script', 'watching', 'one', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'taste', 'again', 'specialness', 'one', 'star', 'so', 'bright', 'was', 'snuffed', 'out', 'too', 'soon.Says', 'Clark', 'week', 'Marilyn', 'here', 'what', 'remember', 'most', 'embrace', 'belief', 'joy', 'gave', 'was', 'gift', 'When', 'think', 'now', 'think', 'time', 'when', 'dream', 'came', 'true', 'only', 'talent', 'was', 'not', 'close', 'eyes']",My Week with Marilyn

1450958,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0059XTUB8,Ed Uyeshima,"[87, 98]","The real Marilyn Monroe was an inch and a half taller than Michelle Williams, a significant difference when one considers that there is no way Williams could have replicated the voluptuous physicality of Monroe's presence. Yet, the young actress does something quite unexpected in capturing the essence of Monroe's wounded psyche for all its frailties and doing a convincing job of conveying the public Marilyn for all her breathy sensuality in this modest 2011 showbiz tale. Directed by British TV veteran Simon Curtis and written by Adrian Hodges, the film depicts a minor piece of motion picture lore based on the memoirs of Colin Clark, who was a lowly ""third assistant director"" during the production of the Ruritanian romance,The Prince and the Showgirl. The mostly forgotten 1957 movie marked Monroe's attempt at being taken seriously as an actress in a well-publicized collaboration with Sir Laurence Olivier just after she married playwright Arthur Miller.The story really begins with Monroe's arrival in London to start filming. Fully devoted to Lee Strasberg's school of Method acting, she constantly searches for her character's motivation even within the context of a souffl&eacute;-light drawing room comedy. With sychophantic acting coach Paula Strasberg constantly by her side, she is chronically tardy on the set keeping her distinguished British company of thespians waiting for hours. Monroe's already renowned insecurities become heightened by Olivier's abrasive impatience as not only her co-star but her director. As a witness to her undeniable aura, the young Colin becomes smitten as he is assigned to be her protector when she begins to bond with him after Miller returns to New York. This leads to a getaway visiting Windsor Castle and Eton College before a comparatively more confident Monroe returns to the set. The film is bookended by Williams' fearlessly entertaining takes on the Monroe classics, Irving Berlin's ""Heat Wave"" and Harold Arlen's ""That Old Black Magic"" (although completely out of their original context).Williams tackles the impossible with her empathetic performance as Monroe, and she manages it with aplomb without resorting to outright impersonation. One deliberate exception is the enchanting little dance she does as her character in the movie within the movie - she mimics Monroe perfectly in those few moments. Eddie Redmayne plays the callow Colin to the best of the screenplay's workmanlike limitations since the only hint of complexity is breaking the heart of the young costumer played in a fetching manner by an underused Emma Watson. As Olivier, Kenneth Branagh captures the ego-driven bluster and measured speech cadence of the legendary actor, but he is also underserved by Hodges' script. Judi Dench again steals her scenes as a fellow scene-stealer, Dame Sybil Thorndike. Barely making a ripple in the story are Julia Ormond as Olivier's then-wife, Vivien Leigh, with just a hint given of her descent into madness, and Dougray Scott as a taciturn Miller. For all its flaws, the film is worth seeing for Williams' mesmerizing work, for example, the scene where she romps through the English countryside conveying Monroe's sense of freedom in a way that recalls a similarly poignant scene inThe Misfits.",4,Williams' Empathetic Take on Marilyn Trumps the Evocative Film's More Superficial Elements,1322092800,"11 24, 2011",2011,3266,"['real', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'was', 'inch', 'half', 'taller', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'significant', 'difference', 'when', 'one', 'way', 'Williams', 'could', 'have', 'replicated', 'voluptuous', 'physicality', 'Monroe', 'presence', 'young', 'actress', 'something', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'capturing', 'essence', 'Monroe', 'wounded', 'psyche', 'frailties', 'doing', 'convincing', 'job', 'conveying', 'public', 'Marilyn', 'breathy', 'sensuality', 'modest', '2011', 'showbiz', 'tale', 'Directed', 'British', 'TV', 'veteran', 'Simon', 'Curtis', 'written', 'Adrian', 'Hodges', 'film', 'minor', 'piece', 'motion', 'picture', 'lore', 'based', 'memoirs', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'who', 'was', 'lowly', 'third', 'assistant', 'director', 'production', 'Ruritanian', 'romance', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'mostly', 'forgotten', '1957', 'movie', 'marked', 'Monroe', 'attempt', 'being', 'taken', 'seriously', 'actress', 'well-publicized', 'collaboration', 'Sir', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'just', 'married', 'playwright', 'Arthur', 'Miller.The', 'story', 'really', 'Monroe', 'arrival', 'London', 'start', 'filming', 'Fully', 'devoted', 'Lee', 'Strasberg', 'school', 'Method', 'acting', 'constantly', 'character', 'motivation', 'even', 'context', 'souffl', 'eacute', 'drawing', 'room', 'comedy', 'sychophantic', 'acting', 'coach', 'Paula', 'Strasberg', 'constantly', 'side', 'chronically', 'tardy', 'set', 'keeping', 'distinguished', 'British', 'company', 'thespians', 'waiting', 'hours', 'Monroe', 'already', 'renowned', 'insecurities', 'become', 'heightened', 'Olivier', 'abrasive', 'impatience', 'not', 'only', 'co-star', 'director', 'witness', 'undeniable', 'aura', 'young', 'Colin', 'smitten', 'assigned', 'be', 'protector', 'when', 'bond', 'Miller', 'returns', 'New', 'York', 'getaway', 'visiting', 'Windsor', 'Castle', 'Eton', 'College', 'comparatively', 'more', 'confident', 'Monroe', 'returns', 'set', 'film', 'bookended', 'Williams', 'fearlessly', 'entertaining', 'Monroe', 'classics', 'Irving', 'Berlin', 'Heat', 'Wave', 'Harold', 'Arlen', 'Old', 'Black', 'Magic', 'completely', 'original', 'context', 'impossible', 'empathetic', 'performance', 'Monroe', 'aplomb', 'resorting', 'outright', 'impersonation', 'One', 'deliberate', 'exception', 'enchanting', 'little', 'dance', 'character', 'movie', 'movie', 'Monroe', 'perfectly', 'few', 'moments', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'callow', 'Colin', 'best', 'screenplay', 'workmanlike', 'limitations', 'only', 'hint', 'complexity', 'breaking', 'heart', 'young', 'costumer', 'played', 'fetching', 'manner', 'underused', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Olivier', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'ego-driven', 'bluster', 'measured', 'speech', 'cadence', 'legendary', 'actor', 'also', 'underserved', 'Hodges', 'script', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'again', 'scenes', 'fellow', 'scene-stealer', 'Dame', 'Sybil', 'Thorndike', 'Barely', 'making', 'ripple', 'story', 'are', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'Olivier', 'then-wife', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'just', 'hint', 'given', 'descent', 'madness', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'taciturn', 'Miller', 'flaws', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Williams', 'mesmerizing', 'work', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'English', 'countryside', 'conveying', 'Monroe', 'sense', 'freedom', 'way', 'similarly', 'poignant', 'scene', 'inThe', 'Misfits']",My Week with Marilyn
1450959,A3PECZX773ME74,B0059XTUB8,E. K. Moseley,"[1, 3]","""My week with Marilyn"", was a very big disappointment to me. I had to watch this DVD three different times to make sure I was writing a review that was not bias. I have been studying Marilyn Monroe since 1969 and I have to say they had Marilyn's troubled side down very well. However, with that being said I think a carried that message over a little too much. The bonus features on this DVD really did not explain enough for me to say that this was or should have been Oscar worthy. I know it was nominated but I still cannot figure out why.The actors in this film were good and they did give it an excellent try, some more than others, as a character study for Marilyn Monroe. Michelle Williams as much as I wanted to see her as Marilyn just did not do it in my mind. Let me qualify that statement by saying her height and weight did not fit Marilyn Monroe's body sculpture nor did the voice and facial expressions totally come through as Marilyn Monroe. Michelle did not have that breathy sound as she saying or spoke. Michelle has a wonderful voice for singing, Marilyn on the other hand had a sensual breathy sound to her voice when singing or speaking. Michelle Williams really had the moxie to get out there and try this part and succeed as she did. After all an Oscar nomination is not bad. The young man playing Colin was wonderful I'm surprised that he was not at least recognize in some fashion for his portrayal in this film. Emily Watson was wonderful and brought a different view to Marilyn Monroe on the set. This dimension should have been brought forward a little more.There are so many areas that could have been brought forward in a film like this that were not that disappointed me. It seemed as though this was more of a character study than a portrait of an American actress who was loved and despised simultaneously by many in the industry and in her fan base.This would've been better off as a TV movie instead of a feature film. It seemed a little long with redundancy throughout the film. I did not read the book that this DVD was supposed to came from. So I cannot do a compare and contrast of the two.I hope this recommendation is going to get you to think before you purchase of a possible rental. It is worth the rental fee.

Yet Marilyn does not want to be worshiped, only loved and respected, and both seem beyond her reach.  Her Lindsay Lohan-esque antics aggravate her colleagues, and her new husband-- playwright Arthur Miller-- condescends to her and secretly wishes he had never married Marilyn.

OK.""  Then when we got to the theater and after we bought the tickets, we found that the movie was available only in one of those so-called dinner theater setups, with a total seating capacity of 32, and no seats available for us to sit together.  Now we like to have meals out, and we like to go to movies, but we just don't care to do both at the same time.  To us it is incongruous to watch a meaningful film with the smell of French fries and burgers or whatever, wafting over everything.  So we got a refund and went home very disgruntled.  And kept looking for the possibility of the movie showing up in wider distribution, as sometimes mysteriously happens.  Well, finally, we found it at a `normal' movie theater, fifteen miles away, and now we were flat determined to go see that movie.  And oh, how glad we were that we did.  The story was beautifully written and directed, the actors were all superb, and we walked out of the movie and all we could say was, ""Wow"".  And we passed the word along to all our friends, along with the less than encouraging difficulty it was to even find the movie being shown, much less in what we consider a suitable venue.Apparently the receipts on this film are remarkably low because no one could find it, and yet the film has garnered all sorts of awards and nominations, including Academy nominations for two of the actors.  And we simply cannot figure out why on earth this jewel of a film was not as carefully marketed and displayed as it was carefully made.  Some of the films nominated for ""Best Movie"" made a lot of money.  At least two of them, in our opinions, weren't worth the digital material it took to film them.  There's no accounting for tastes.  But for all the folks out there who love good movies with good stories and good actors and wonderful settings, get the DVD of MWWM.  Ours is already ordered.

1450972,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B0059XTUB8,F. S. L'hoir,"[0, 0]","I was pleasantly surprised by this film, for which I had few expectations (I certainly enjoyed Marilyn Monroe in ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""All About Eve"", but I would never have called myself one of her fans). The photogenic Michelle Williams's seemingly unstudied portrayal of Marilyn certainly measures up to Academy standards, and British A-list actors Kenneth Brannagh, Judy Dench, and Michael Kitchen are top-drawer, as one might expect.  Zo Wanamaker is terrific as Paula Strasberg, whose sycophantic solution seems to be part of Marilyn's problem; and Emma Watson and Eddie Redmayne are very pleasant in their roles.The spectacular English countryside, with the camera's visits to Eton and Windsor Castle, is well worth the price of the DVD. And Alexander Desplat's musical score, realised by Lang Lang's singular artistry at the piano, contributes to the tissue-thin ambience of the film's what-might-have-been scenario. For me, the only sour note is Julia Ormonde's portrayal of Vivien Leigh, whom I remember as being just as vulnerable, troubled, and lovely--even in her 40s--as Monroe was in her 30s. It seems to me that the director could have made a far more interesting film if he had compared and contrasted the two women and what their effect must have been on Olivier's psyche during the months of filming; but that possibility was overlooked in the casting of Ormond, whose characterisation of Olivier's unhappy wife is as hard as nails.I found the most fascinating aspect of ""Marilyn"" to be in the recreation of the filming of ""The Prince and the Showgirl."" No, Michelle Williams is not the spit and image of Marilyn Monroe, but, for me she suggests her essence. Nor does Kenneth Brannagh resemble Lawrence Olivier, but his performance and hers certainly create a reasonable facsimile of what might have happened during the confrontation between Olivier, the immovable object, and Monroe, the irresistible force.After all, who could hope to capture the exact reproduction of a cultural icon?",4,The Trouble with Marilyn,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,2008,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'had', 'few', 'expectations', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Hot', 'Eve', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'called', 'one', 'fans', 'photogenic', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'seemingly', 'unstudied', 'portrayal', 'Marilyn', 'certainly', 'up', 'Academy', 'standards', 'British', 'A-list', 'actors', 'Kenneth', 'Brannagh', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'are', 'top-drawer', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'Zo', 'Wanamaker', 'terrific', 'Paula', 'Strasberg', 'sycophantic', 'solution', 'be', 'part', 'Marilyn', 'problem', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'are', 'very', 'pleasant', 'roles.The', 'spectacular', 'English', 'countryside', 'camera', 'visits', 'Eton', 'Windsor', 'Castle', 'well', 'price', 'DVD', 'Alexander', 'Desplat', 'musical', 'score', 'realised', 'Lang', 'Lang', 'singular', 'artistry', 'piano', 'tissue-thin', 'ambience', 'film', 'what-might-have-been', 'scenario', 'only', 'sour', 'note', 'Julia', 'Ormonde', 'portrayal', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'whom', 'remember', 'being', 'just', 'vulnerable', 'troubled', 'lovely', 'even', '40s', 'Monroe', 'was', '30s', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'had', 'compared', 'contrasted', 'two', 'women', 'what', 'effect', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'Olivier', 'psyche', 'months', 'filming', 'possibility', 'was', 'overlooked', 'casting', 'Ormond', 'characterisation', 'Olivier', 'unhappy', 'wife', 'as', 'hard', 'nails.I', 'found', 'most', 'fascinating', 'aspect', 'Marilyn', 'be', 'recreation', 'filming', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'No', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'not', 'spit', 'image', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'essence', 'Kenneth', 'Brannagh', 'resemble', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'performance', 'hers', 'certainly', 'create', 'reasonable', 'facsimile', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'confrontation', 'Olivier', 'immovable', 'object', 'Monroe', 'irresistible', 'force.After', 'who', 'could', 'hope', 'capture', 'exact', 'reproduction', 'cultural', 'icon']",My Week with Marilyn

I never knew about the diary kept by Colin Clark, a third director on the film, who became a confidant of Marilyn's during her filming at the historic Pinehurst studios. The film, My Week With Marilyn"" is based upon Clark's diary kept of his brief relationship with Marilyn Monroe during the time she had a falling out with Arthur Miller. Marilyn found notes playwright Miller was keeping about his newly wedded wife while he accompanied her to England for the filming. Marilyn's desperation and neediness propelled Miller to take a break from being Mr. Marilyn Monroe and to return to New York to visit his children. While he was absent, she needed someone to bolster her very fragile ego. The film depicts, with a stellar cast, the travails and triumphs during the shoot.

1450975,A3JKK3VYJU990R,B0059XTUB8,Gary K. McCormick,"[3, 6]","""My Week With Marilyn"" is a bittersweet look into a young man's amazing encounter with the woman who defined stardom in the 1950s and early 1960s, and held millions of people in thrall from the silver screen. Colin Clark's true-life tale of his time working as a 3rd Assistant Director (i.e., a ""go-fer"") on the production of Sir Laurence Olivier's 1957 film, ""The Prince and the Showgirl"", is a charming, understated recreation of Clark's experiences during a few weeks in 1956, during which time he briefly became a member of Marilyn Monroe's inner circle.Marilyn was, by all accounts, a fragile and insecure woman, and arrived in England for filming surrounded by an entourage (though small by today's media-darling standards) who tended her - and controlled her, to a certain extent. The 23-year-old Clark, in his position assisting Olivier, was often called on to get Monroe to the movie set on time and run errands for her as well as Olivier. It was in this capacity that he caught Marilyn's eye. As difficult as it may be to believe the events that unfold, as Marilyn takes Colin into her confidence, the film sells them with a charming, low-key approach.Eddie Redmayne plays Colin Clark with just the right amount of wide-eyed naivet&eacute; maturing into an increasing worldliness. Michelle Williams as Monroe is, in a word, magnificent. She captures Marilyn's beauty, fragility, and insecurity amazingly well, and is at her best, I think, when portraying Marilyn at her ease - whether charming young Clark during a day of playing ""hooky"" to see the sights in the English countryside, or lighting up with an impromptu star turn for admiring young Etonians or the staff at Windsor Castle during an unscheduled visit.Kenneth Branagh is quite believable as Olivier, and the ironic juxtaposition of Branagh portraying the man whose career footsteps he has shadowed won't be lost on the viewer who is at all familiar with their two careers. Dame Judi Dench is delightful as Lady Sybil Thorndike, the septuagenarian actress who portrayed the Queen Dowager to Olivier's Prince Regent in the film, providing a supportive counterpoint to Branagh/Olivier's frustration and exasperation with Marilyn's tardiness and insecurity. Emma Watson, of ""Harry Potter"" fame, is charming in a small role as a junior wardrobe mistress with whom Colin Clark has a brief relationship before being drawn into Marilyn's orbit - the role is a foreshadowing of the great things to come, post-Potter, for Miss Watson.Visually beautiful, and true to period in setting & wardrobe, ""My Week With Marilyn"" is a treat.",5,"Entertaining, True-To-Life Tale of an Encounter with a Star",1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,2592,"['Week', 'Marilyn', 'bittersweet', 'look', 'young', 'man', 'amazing', 'encounter', 'woman', 'who', 'defined', 'stardom', '1950s', 'early', '1960s', 'held', 'millions', 'people', 'thrall', 'silver', 'screen', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'true-life', 'tale', 'time', 'working', '3rd', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'i.e.', 'go-fer', 'production', 'Sir', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', '1957', 'film', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'charming', 'understated', 'recreation', 'Clark', 'experiences', 'few', 'weeks', '1956', 'time', 'became', 'member', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'inner', 'circle.Marilyn', 'was', 'accounts', 'fragile', 'insecure', 'woman', 'arrived', 'England', 'filming', 'surrounded', 'entourage', 'small', 'today', 'media-darling', 'standards', 'who', 'tended', 'controlled', 'certain', 'extent', '23-year-old', 'Clark', 'position', 'assisting', 'Olivier', 'was', 'often', 'called', 'get', 'Monroe', 'movie', 'set', 'time', 'run', 'errands', 'as', 'well', 'Olivier', 'was', 'capacity', 'caught', 'Marilyn', 'eye', 'As', 'difficult', 'may', 'be', 'believe', 'events', 'unfold', 'Marilyn', 'Colin', 'confidence', 'film', 'charming', 'low-key', 'approach.Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'wide-eyed', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'maturing', 'increasing', 'worldliness', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Monroe', 'word', 'magnificent', 'Marilyn', 'beauty', 'fragility', 'insecurity', 'amazingly', 'well', 'best', 'think', 'when', 'portraying', 'Marilyn', 'ease', 'charming', 'young', 'Clark', 'day', 'playing', 'hooky', 'see', 'sights', 'English', 'countryside', 'lighting', 'up', 'impromptu', 'star', 'turn', 'admiring', 'young', 'Etonians', 'staff', 'Windsor', 'Castle', 'unscheduled', 'visit.Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'quite', 'believable', 'Olivier', 'ironic', 'juxtaposition', 'Branagh', 'portraying', 'man', 'career', 'footsteps', 'shadowed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'lost', 'viewer', 'who', 'familiar', 'two', 'careers', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'delightful', 'Lady', 'Sybil', 'Thorndike', 'septuagenarian', 'actress', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Queen', 'Dowager', 'Olivier', 'Prince', 'Regent', 'film', 'providing', 'supportive', 'counterpoint', 'Branagh/Olivier', 'frustration', 'exasperation', 'Marilyn', 'tardiness', 'insecurity', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fame', 'charming', 'small', 'role', 'junior', 'wardrobe', 'mistress', 'whom', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'brief', 'relationship', 'being', 'drawn', 'Marilyn', 'orbit', 'role', 'foreshadowing', 'great', 'things', 'come', 'post-Potter', 'Miss', 'Watson.Visually', 'beautiful', 'true', 'period', 'setting', 'wardrobe', 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'treat']",My Week with Marilyn

Amazing that Marilyn still generates so much interest and has as big a mystique and charisma as ever.This film takes place in 1956, when Marilyn traveled to England to film The Prince and the Showgirl with Laurence Olivier. Michelle Williams captures the essence of Marilyn brilliantly. Ms. Williams deservedly won a Golden Globe award and was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Marilyn is difficult, temperamental, neurotic, but undeniably dazzling and talented. Kenneth Branagh is perfect as Olivier and was also Oscar nominated.

1450979,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0059XTUB8,Grady Harp,"[7, 8]","Marilyn Monroe remains one of the most famous creations of Hollywood for the last century.  In many ways she satisfied the needs of Everyman: she came form a abusive and loveless childhood, entered the realm of celluloid because of an incandescent beauty of body and face, she captured the hearts of everyone who flocked to her movies, she became the Queen of the World, and yet she was likely as fragile and insecure little porcelain doll as ever existed.  MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is apparently a true story written by Colin Clark based on his diaries `My Week With Marilyn' and `The Prince, the Showgirl and Me' and in Adrian Hodges adaptation for the screen all of the above mentioned qualities of the public and private Marilyn Monroe are condensed in a 90-minute film.  On many levels it works despite the rather choppy manner in which it is presented by director Simon Curtis.1955 and Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) is moving form the theater to make a movie in London. Young Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), a lad form a wealthy family who is obsessed with being in the film business, wants to be involved and he navigates himself a job on the set. When film star Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) arrives for the start of shooting, all of London is excited to see the blonde bombshell, while Olivier attempts to struggle to meet her many demands and acting ineptness, and Colin is intrigued by her. Colin's intrigue is met when Marilyn invites him into her inner world where she struggles with her fame, her beauty and her desire to be a great actress. It is this week of extreme fragility in Monroe's life where we discover more about Marilyn's psyche than we ever thought possible.Populating the making of the film are Olivier's wife Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond), Dame Sybil Thorndike (Judi Dench) who bolsters Marilyn's ego, Marilyn's current husband playwright Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott), Marilyn's acting coach and mentor Paula Strasberg (Zo Wanamaker), Marilyn's contingent of American movie moguls Milton Green (Dominic Cooper) and Arthur Jacobs (Toby Jones) as well as Colin's relative Sir Owen Morshead (Derek Jacobi) and Colin's would-be girlfriend Lucy (Emma Watson) along with a massive group of supporting actors in small roles. Michelle Williams and the makeup and costume department seem less interested in re-creating a Monroe droid, instead allowing Williams to enter the persona of Monroe - a wise decision and Williams accomplishes the impossible task of making us see Marilyn Monroe as a person.  The remainder of the cast is quite fine as one would expect with a group of actors of this caliber.  One can wonder why the many roles of Americans were cast with British actors, but that is a quibble. Though Williams has a lovely little voice in her many singing moments she does not resemble then inimitable Monroe sound and quirky vibrato - but that is in keeping with creating the spirit of Monroe and not imitating or mimicking the inimitable.  Alexandre Desplat once again provides a perfect music score for the film. In the end this is a satisfying if not overwhelming memoir of the one and only Marilyn Monroe. It works, thanks in large part to Michelle Williams.

Even though he gives an okay performance as a sometimes stuffy, always impatient British actor, I did not see Laurence Olivier.

Impressively, Michelle Williams has many disguises for her role. She can play Marilyn with fragility. Other times she is deceitful. You can misread her character as unintelligible, and that would be faithless to how gifted she really is. Always beautiful but within her is something haunting that weighs on her persona. We understand how shattered she is within when she speaks of her childhood. How she admires people who come from a safe and comforting home. And we understand how lost she feels by her desperate search for a home.The movie focuses around the production of ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" in 1957. The film follows Colin Clark, but it is of course about Marilyn Monroe. Instead of a Biopic of Marilyn, we get an outsiders view of her life. Colin is a young man who comes from a wealthy and affluent family. He wants to break away for a summer and spend it on adventures with Hollywood types. This should sound all too familiar as it is used by many movies of the past. This leads to an intimate week with one of the most celebrated actresses of all time.The movie is fun and light hearted. It does not become dramatically heavy or serious, which is something I almost expected. Instead it's more relaxed, and has a dreamy mood. Serious themes like heavy drug use and inner turmoil are distractions to Marilyn's flirtatious relationship with Colin.My week with Marilyn has a nominating performace done by Michelle Williams and is a quick stroll down history lane. It is an enjoyable movie that is not altogether wonderful, but is a cultured work of art rather than a production monster made for the largest audience possible. It tells a stirring human story without any reliances on your usual thrills. It is a movie made for people who appreciate a good novel, and stories about interesting people. And I do not recommend that you pass this film up. See it for yourself and avoid other cash cow movies instead.

Second, the woman with whom the young protagonist falls in love was none other than the silver screen goddess of the twentieth century, Marilyn Monroe.A young Eton graduate of wealth and privilege, Colin Clark had the good fortune to wrangle an assignment as the third director on Laurence Olivier's film version of ""The Prince and the Showgirl,"" starring the fifty-year-old British master thespian and the thirty-year-old American sex bomb.Olivier hoped the film would rejuvenate his career, and Monroe hoped that working under the direction of the legendary actor would lend her more credibility as an actress.Neither ambition was fulfilled, although as the director notes in his commentary, both parties went on to score two of the greatest triumphs of their respective careers after this silly comedy, Olivier in the stage play ""The Entertainer"" and Monroe in the classic Billy Wilder farce ""Some Like It Hot.""Now I remember seeing ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" many years ago, and I recall being struck at how effortlessly Monroe stole the picture lock, stock, and barrel from her infinitely more experienced co-star, who chewed up the scenery until it fell to the floor as the finest sawdust, all to little avail.Fine performances dominate ""My Week with Marilyn,"" notably of course Michelle Williams as Monroe and Kenneth Branagh as Olivier.  One can see why Williams received an Oscar Best Actress nomination for this part, in recognition of her courage alone at stepping into the immortal screen icon's high heels.Though Williams is a lovely woman, she still can't hold a candle to the luminous and magnetic Monroe.  Still, Williams does succeed in conveying the insecurity and vulnerability that lay right beneath Monroe's seductive facade.Branagh in turn is clearly having great fun with the plummy role of Olivier, and his comic flourishes and bursts of pique at Monroe's antics are worth the price of the DVD by themselves.  Add in splendid supporting turns by Judi Dench, Julia Ormond, Zoe Wanamaker, and even young Emma Watson as Monroe's over-matched rival for Colin's attentions, and you have many magnificent performances to enjoy here.I should also cite Eddie Redmayne as Colin, who manages to be both sensitive and sympathetic as the young man of privilege smitten with the vulnerable screen siren.This DVD also includes a making-of featurette, as well as a director's commentary in which Simon Curtis emphasizes the meticulous attention to detail to which this production adhered in bringing this decades-old story to life.In sum, fans of Monroe, Olivier, movie history, and coming-of-age stories will all find much to admire here.

After watching My Week With Marilyn I came away feeling sorry for both her, and the man who spent the week with her, aspiring filmmaker Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne).According to the movie she never knew her father. Instead she kept a photo of Abraham Lincoln by her bed, the logic being ""it might as well be him."" Her mother didn't want to care for her, so she was placed with foster parents.By the time we're into My Week With Marilyn she's been married three times, and divorced twice.Marilyn, at the time, was married to Arthur Miller (the author of To Kill a Mockingbird). She is to be learning her lines for The Prince and The Showgirl. Arthur is there, partially to support his new bride, but mainly to work on his next novel. Marilyn is needy, usually distraught about something and an early victim of taking pills to get up, pills to go to sleep, and what ever else. Arthur can't concentrate so leaves.That's when Colin moves in -- he's young, never been in a relationship and infatuated with Marilyn.Laurence Olivier recognizes this and tells young Colin, ""Remember boy, when it comes to women, you're never too old for humiliation."" But it's to no avail - he's lovestruck.Marilyn locks herself in her bedroom. Her co-stars become worried and frustrated because she is holding up production.

Her inner circle may have sucked up to her like she was a brilliantly innovative and intellectual devotee to the craft of acting, but the bottom line is that people were fascinated with Monroe because they wanted to have sex with her or because they wanted to be like her, and that was why she was famous and adored (and hated, too, I imagine).

1451007,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0059XTUB8,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","My Week with Marilyn is based on two books by Colin Clark; one a diary documenting the shoot of The Prince and the Showgirl, the other a memoir of his alleged affair with Marilyn Monroe during that shoot. Even though it has origins in literature, the plot is noticeably lacking. Then again, I suppose My Week with Marilyn was never really about plot. Distributed by the Weinstein Company, this is a film for Harvey Weinstein to provide awards push. It's a slight film, where a strong, complex story takes a backseat to providing roles for talented actors to fill and potentially win Oscars for. That's not to say the making of the film itself or the performances are driven by greed or that any involvement is superficial, just that no one involved was surprised when they were nominated for their work.This movie boasts several strong performances, but the focus comes down on Michelle Williams as the titular character. I trust Williams as an actress, but I never envisioned her as Monroe. To embody the cosmic force that was Marilyn Monroe is no easy task. Now, I can't envision anyone tackling this role so beautifully. For a brief 99 minutes, Williams is Marilyn Monroe. She embodies her, absorbing all of the characteristics and producing a performance with more dimension than what was initially on the page. It's no secret that Monroe was more troubled and complicated than her onscreen persona, but the film only allows glimpses of her true nature. After all, it takes place during a brief period of time, from the limited perspective of one person who had never met her and would never meet her again. Alas, this is not a Monroe biopic. It's harmless, award-hungry fluff that rises above the material with one of the most convincing transformations into a real person I've seen in some time.Eddie Redmayne is 23-year-old Colin Clark, whose determination lands him a job as the assistant to Laurence Olivier (played by Kenneth Branagh, a nice touch) on the set of The Prince and the Showgirl. Olivier is directing the film and has cast Monroe, whom he can barely conceal his yearning for. Of course, Olivier was married to Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond) and Monroe to Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) at the time, but Monroe's affect on men has been well documented. Colin, like anyone in her presence, is drawn to her but is preoccupied with keeping his job and attempting to woo a set girl named Lucy (Emma Watson). With Olivier growing increasingly frustrated with the aloof Monroe, who is busy grappling with her own insecurities, Colin suddenly finds himself befriending Monroe. Romance, to some extent, ensues, but the film is coy about it. Perhaps the book goes into greater detail, but nothing about the story is particularly fascinating or memorable. It's all a backdrop.To play a real person, an actor does not need to resemble the person they're portraying. Their job is to capture the essence of a person rather than embody their physical characteristics. Branagh and Oliver share only a fleeting resemblance, while Ormond hardly looks like Leigh at all. Meanwhile, Redmayne and Scott look a little closer to their real-life counterparts, but Williams is the whole package. Perhaps this contributes to how much her performance stands out. I'm not knocking Redmayne, Scott, Branagh, or Ormond, but Williams trumps them all and completely inhabits Marilyn Monroe, essence and all. How appropriate, in this context. Monroe embraced the Method approach to acting, while Olivier saw acting as little more than saying the lines convincingly. Branagh says his lines convincingly, but Williams disappears.In life, Williams doesn't look much like Monroe. Makeup and acting ability apparently go a long way. She magically captures the voice, the charm, the more private aspects, and, of course, the iconic look. When she is onscreen, you forget you're watching Williams. A role like this screams ""Oscar!"" but she really brings it to life triumphantly. Her Oscar-nomination is well-deserved and I wouldn't be terribly disappointed if she won. The film does a sufficient job of showing the multiple sides of Monroe's personality, but is restricted from going too in-depth. Neither Williams nor the script is able to paint a complete psychological portrait of Monroe, but both successfully portray the many facets, public and private, of this sex symbol. Williams perfectly balances the mature, yet child-like, flirtatious, innocent quality that Monroe possessed, eternally locked somewhere between cute and sexy. Monroe is presented here as both the person and the ideal, with Williams playing her to perfection without a false note. Redmayne has a likable, boyish charm and it is fun to watch the other actors become Hollywood royalty, but Williams singlehandedly makes the film worth watching.The direction by Simon Curtis is stagnant, simply because anyone could have directed it and there's nothing dynamic about the way the film is put together. The screenplay is fashioned well, recounting events with very little creative flourish. It just misses the boat on being a great film by playing everything too safe. It's a very standard portrait of a true story that would be solid, yet forgettable without the terrific performances. If the Monroe role had been miscast, the film likely would have been satisfying but would have completely slipped from memory afterwards.A minor film with major star power, it's neither deep nor astounding but worth admission price for Michelle Williams' performance. She has already demonstrated a wide breadth of talent, but she shows here that she may not have even touched the surface of her own potential. Aside from my praise for Williams, this review may sound harsh despite my intentions.The major weakness is that it is unapologetic, blatant Oscar-bait and it sticks so close to that particular formula that it lends itself to inferiority. However, blatant Oscar-bait is often better than most films and removing it from this context, My Week with Marilyn stands as a well-made, well-acted film that impresses without surprising. Just like a real-life week with Marilyn would unfold, the film flies by and, like the relationship between Clark and Monroe, there's no middle ground. The film has a beginning and an end, reaching the latter swiftly and almost abruptly. Just like spending a week with Marilyn, she's all that matters during this time...And after.",4,Williams Gives One of 2011's Best Performances,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,6406,"['Week', 'Marilyn',

I am not a huge fan of Michelle Williams or Marilyn Monroe, but I have to say that Williams nailed Monroe's vulnerability in this film and I was absorbed enough to forget that I'm not particularly of fan of either actress.  Of course, this may have been in large part thanks to the outstanding support cast including Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier and Dominic Cooper as part of Monroe's contingent.  That said, it wasn't a perfect film.While I have nothing against Eddie Redmayne and his ability to play Colin Clark is very good, I lost interest in the parts where it was just Colin and Marilyn.  This is not so much the actors' faults but that of the scripting/basis for the film.  The parts where they were actually making the film were much more interesting to me and showed the dynamic at play much better.  However, the making of the film within the film interjected enough of the real life that I was able to stick through until the somewhat predicted end.  That's the one problem with films based on real life, you generally get a sense of how it's going to end even if you're not entirely sure.The acting was superb in some cases, a little short in others, but on the whole I was impressed with the main cast to be convincing more or less in their assigned roles.

She was my first idea of what a woman should be and my nave, adolescent idea of what sex was about. Marilyn was a little girl lost that every man she came into contact with wanted to save, and the different facets of personality continue to fascinate today, as evidenced in ""My Week with Marilyn"".""My Week with Marilyn"" recounts a fairly well known moment in Monroe's life when she went  to England to star in ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" with Laurence Olivier. All accounts of the episode stress that it was a horrible pairing, Olivier in his work ethic as an actor and his craft which clashed with Monroe's insecurities and self-doubt about her acting abilities starting taking over her personality, as well as prescription drugs, which made Monroe late or a no-show for many days of shooting, or her trying to apply ""the method"" to her acting, all of which caused friction and down right loathing between the two. The story is told from the perspective of twenty-three year Colin Clark, who was a third assistant director in Olivier's production company, which essentially made him a gofer. But because Monroe took a liking to Clark he was one of the few people who Monroe would deal with and respond positively to, and they had a brief affair. The movie highlights the clash between the insecurities of Monroe and her acting abilities, and Olivier's insecurities about aging, with Colin caught in the middle and trying to appease both Olivier and Monroe.Williams doesn't have most of Monroe's sexual charisma or most of Monroe's voluptuous attributes, what Williams has right is Monroe's look and the fragile vulnerability of the real Monroe (if there could be such a thing, Marilyn Monroe was the public persona of Norma Jean Baker, a kind of sexual Frankenstein's monster that got away from Baker but ultimately consumed her), and Williams lets that vulnerability show through the sex goddess persona as well. Eddie Redmayne as Colin Clark has the right eager naf-like quality for the role as the credulous liaison between Olivier and Monroe.  Kenneth Branagh disappears into his role as Olivier and although Branagh doesn't resemble Olivier he captures the nuances of Olivier from aging star to frustrated director trying to get a performance out of Monroe. There are also some very nice supporting roles, Emma Watson as a costume designer at the studio who Colin likes and who suddenly finds herself vying for his attentions against the greatest sex symbol of the 20th century. Dame Judi Dench has a nice turn as an aging actress who supports Monroe, and Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh married to Olivier, not trusting his relationship to Monroe, foreshadowing the problems that would come later in her life.While Monroe is an icon that still fascinates us to this day, maybe just that iconography may be sifting down to us. My sister watched the movie and thought it a bit boring, so this movie may be for people of a certain age, I hope not, I found it a well acted and interesting vignette into Olivier's and Monroe's life. If we don't remember the person behind the icon than we truly have hollow idols and lost the person behind them.The bonus section has a nice making of the feature that lends insights into the principles both past and present as well as background material to the period. There's also a directors commentary.",5,50 Years Later Marilyn Still Fascinates,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,3424,"['Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'was', 'boy', 'boys', 'certain', 'time', 'period', 'fantasy', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'first', 'idea', 'what', 'woman', 'should', 'be', 'nave', 'adolescent', 'idea', 'what', 'sex', 'was', 'about', 'Marilyn', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'lost', 'man', 'came', 'contact', 'wanted', 'save', 'different', 'facets', 'personality', 'continue', 'fascinate', 'today', 'evidenced', 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'fairly', 'well', 'known', 'moment', 'Monroe', 'life', 'when', 'went', 'England', 'star', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'accounts', 'episode', 'stress', 'was', 'horrible', 'pairing', 'Olivier', 'work', 'ethic', 'actor', 'craft', 'clashed', 'Monroe', 'insecurities', 'self-doubt', 'acting', 'abilities', 'starting', 'taking', 'over', 'personality', 'as', 'well', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'made', 'Monroe', 'late', 'no-show', 'many', 'days', 'shooting', 'trying', 'apply', 'method', 'acting', 'caused', 'friction', 'down', 'right', 'loathing', 'two', 'story', 'told', 'perspective', 'twenty-three', 'year', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'who', 'was', 'third', 'assistant', 'director', 'Olivier', 'production', 'company', 'essentially', 'made', 'gofer', 'Monroe', 'took', 'liking', 'Clark', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'Monroe', 'would', 'deal', 'respond', 'positively', 'had', 'brief', 'affair', 'movie', 'clash', 'insecurities', 'Monroe', 'acting', 'abilities', 'Olivier', 'insecurities', 'aging', 'Colin', 'caught', 'middle', 'trying', 'appease', 'Olivier', 'Monroe.Williams', ""n't"", 'have', 'most', 'Monroe', 'sexual', 'charisma', 'most', 'Monroe', 'voluptuous', 'attributes', 'what', 'Williams', 'right', 'Monroe', 'look', 'fragile', 'vulnerability', 'real', 'Monroe', 'could', 'be', 'such', 'thing', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'was', 'public', 'persona', 'Norma', 'Jean', 'Baker', 'kind', 'sexual', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'got', 'away', 'Baker', 'ultimately', 'consumed', 'Williams', 'vulnerability', 'show', 'sex', 'goddess', 'persona', 'as', 'well', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'right', 'eager', 'naf-like', 'quality', 'role', 'credulous', 'liaison', 'Olivier', 'Monroe', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'role', 'Olivier', 'Branagh', ""n't"", 'resemble', 'Olivier', 'nuances', 'Olivier', 'aging', 'star', 'frustrated', 'director', 'trying', 'get', 'performance', 'Monroe', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'costume', 'designer', 'studio', 'who', 'Colin', 'likes', 'who', 'suddenly', 'vying', 'attentions', 'greatest', 'sex', 'symbol', '20th', 'century', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'nice', 'turn', 'aging', 'actress', 'who', 'Monroe', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'married', 'Olivier', 'not', 'trusting', 'relationship', 'Monroe', 'foreshadowing', 'problems', 'would', 'come', 'later', 'life.While', 'Monroe', 'icon', 'still', 'day', 'maybe', 'just', 'iconography', 'may', 'be', 'sifting', 'sister', 'watched', 'movie', 'thought', 'bit', 'boring', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'people', 'certain', 'age', 'hope', 'not', 'found', 'well', 'acted', 'interesting', 'vignette', 'Olivier', 'Monroe', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'person', 'icon', 'truly', 'have', 'hollow', 'idols', 'lost', 'person', 'them.The', 'bonus', 'section', 'nice', 'making', 'feature', 'insights', 'principles', 'past', 'present', 'as', 'well', 'background', 'material', 'period', 'also', 'directors', 'commentary']",My Week with Marilyn

1451014,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0059XTUB8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 2]","Note: This was a Target exclusive item that included the Audiobook by Colin Clark.  While it is a serviceable bonus feature, beware of pricing.  The audiobook itself, if you really want it, can be had for a relatively low price point independently.There are several compelling reasons to admire Simon Curtis' adaptation of Colin Clark's memoir ""My Week with Marilyn,"" least of which is the story of Colin Clark! Michelle Williams nails Marilyn Monroe's vulnerability (if not always her movie star magic) in one of the year's best performances. Kenneth Branagh is terrific as the put-upon Sir Laurence Olivier, a role he seemed destined to play. Judi Dench is invaluable as Dame Sybil Thorndike, I'm surprised she didn't get a bit more attention for this showy supporting turn. Add a roster of top notch actors including Julia Ormond, Emma Watson, Dominic Cooper, Derek Jacobi, Zoe Wanamaker, Dougray Scott, and Toby Jones (to name a few) and it seems like I'd be over the moon on principle alone. The tumultuous film shoot of 1957's ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" (the basis for this film) is the stuff of movie making legend and the prospect of visiting this tale was virtually irresistible to me. Sight unseen, ""My Week with Marilyn"" was easily one of my can't miss films of 2011.And yet, even with all of these elements going for it, ""My Week With Marilyn"" was a bit of a let-down for one reason. Like the book it is based on, the lead character is none of these dynamic personalities--but a rather self-serving minor player named Colin Clark (here played ably by Eddie Redmayne). As Clark would detail it (and he's made almost a lifetime career out of this story), ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" exists almost solely due to his relationship with Marilyn and so the focus of the film is squarely on the thing that interested me the least. Colin Clark is the self-appointed star of this tale. No matter how good everything else is, the central narrative is skewed in such a way with Clark as the hero and savior that nothing else feels particularly reliable. It's a great, great story--it's just filtered through the wrong perspective.Unfamiliar with the tale? Two film worlds collided when Olivier, a classically trained actor, put the world's biggest movie star into his picture. The shoot was a nightmare to orchestrate as Marilyn Monroe, all uncertainty and indecision, seemed unable to fit in with the more rigid structure of filming that Olivier demanded. Williams is terrific as Monroe and captures her mannerisms and vocal quirks to perfection. As everyone (in the movie) watches her on screen, they fall instantly in love with her naturalistic allure--but I'm not sure the film entirely uncovers what was so special and magnetic in the Monroe on-screen persona. What it does do quite successfully is to bring out her humanity, gentleness and unpredictability. Foibles and all, you still want to root for this Marilyn.The on-set part of ""My Week with Marilyn"" is easily its strongest component and it is fascinating to see the movie being created within the movie. But I'm far less interested in the personal life of Colin Clark. It's not Redmayne's fault, he's a talented actor that has made an impression in many other projects. I was simply never convinced that Clark had the impact he wishes us to believe. His tentative romance with Marilyn has its appealing moments, but when we spend so much time with him--I always wanted to get back to Branagh, Dench and company. I think there might still be a great movie to be made on this subject. ""My Week with Marilyn"" is certainly an easy recommendation for the performances, just realize that the tale lacks a bit of balance (and some believability) by being so connected to Clark's memoir. 5 star performances, but the film (for me) is about 3 1/2 stars.

But the real missing ingredient here is Marilyn's dazzling screen presence. That's no knock on Williams! You can count on one hand the number of actresses who possessed the sort of presence as Monroe. Personally, I found the performances by Judy Dench and Emma Watson to be more captivating. But then again, they didn't have the unenviable task of trying to portray a screen legend! As a huge fan of Monroe I found the movie interesting, and I'm certainly glad I watched it. To be fair, Michelle Williams does an admirable job of portraying the person BEHIND the presence: an insecure, lonely, and unhappy woman. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't ultimately disappointed.

During the production of the movie Marilyn developed a friendship with one of the assistant directors, Colin Clark, following the departure of her husband (then), Arthur Miller.

The book ""My Week with Marilyn"" is a very heartfelt & intimate journal in which Mr. Clark shares his personal memoir of that time. I am pleased to note that the movie follows his account quite accurately.The problem with the movie is that as good as the actors may be when it comes to supreme icons such as Marilyn Monroe & Sir Laurence Olivier & Vivien Leigh it is just not likely to work.These icons had something that transcended physical looks, it came across from within, a spark, an intangible aura & regardless of how well an actor can act it is simply not possible to bring that same ""It"" factor to life. Charisma can't be `created', either you have it or you don't.It would be a disservice to say that Michelle Williams did not do a good job portraying Marilyn Monroe, I am sure she did the best she could, but Ms. Williams is no Marilyn Monroe. Kenneth Branagh, wonderful actor that he is, is no Olivier. Julia Ormond is a wonderful & beautiful actress but she is not Vivien Leigh & through no fault of her own it simply was not believable.

The fact that Marilyn had self-esteem problems has been documented in books and was presented in this movie visibly.  Of course Laurence Olivier could likely make anyone have self doubts.  At least in this movie he comes across as a first class horse's butt.  The movie centers around the filming of a movie starring Marilyn and Laurence that was finally named ""the Prince and the Show Girl"" although I don't believe that title was ever mentioned in this movie.  The primary action however was not the filming of the movie. It was about the problems trying to get Marilyn to participate in the filming as a result of Laurence's belligerent attitude and about the time she spent with the assistant to the assistant director, an Englishman, who was assigned to take care of her needs during her stay in England.

1451033,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B0059XTUB8,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[7, 10]","When I went to see this movie in December, inwardly I was lamenting the overall quality of movies in 2011, with a plethora of remakes, reboots and sequels, and I wondered if Hollywood was running out of fresh ideas, while recycling the same formulas.  Remakes/reboots in 2011 included  Straw Dogs, Footloose, Arthur,  The Thing, Conan, Spy Kids, Final Destination 5, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes.Some of the movies were high quality such as Girl with the dragon tattoo, and Xmen First Class.Last year Michelle Williams deservedly received her second Academy Award nomination forBlue Valentine, and now she is nominated for the role of Marilyn Monroe.  I liked this movie enormously, and was disappointed that it did not get nominated for Best Picture instead of Extremely Loud and Incredibly close, a dubious choice.Nevertheless politics being what it is  if MWWM was nominated it might give the appearance of Weinstein Studios having too much sway with the Academy Awards, as they also released the Artist with 11 nominations, and the appalling Iron Lady whose only redeeming grace is Meryl Streeps nominated performance, and last year had The Kings Speech.What Michelle Williams and the movie delivers is a very delicately nuanced and multi dimensional portait of Marilyn that we have not seen previously, those shifts in personality, her ability to be vunerable, to charm, to seduce and manipulate, and if you are Larry Olivier the ability to frustrate your ambition to make an incredible movie. In a perhaps ironic twist in view of recent events we see the entourage of people who can't say no or risk punishment or exclusion.So we have a young wideeyed  man who through connections gets his first job in the business working for Olivier, and responsible for keeping things even with Marilyn. If you're like me you wonder if he will be drawn too far into the web of Marilyn, and if the obvious siren attraction of Marilyn will be his doom.  They grow close and here is where the movie takes some liberties on the book on which it's based, but the will they won't they aspect will keep you guessing after the final credits roll.  The movie captures the period very well.Although most attention has focused on the performance of Michelle Williams, I loved the performance of Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier. He listened to Oliver on audio to perfect the mannerisms and the lines, and even had the exact same shoes custom made to fit the part.It seems fitting that someone who has spent a career following in Olivier's footsteps, acting Shakespeare and bringing the plays to the screen, may finally get the Academy Award for walking in his shoes.It's clear here that he is a superior actor, and perfectly achieves both his theatrical mannerisms and intonations particularly rolling the R's, and all the grand subtleties of the theatrical master.  At the end of the movie he delivers a portion of a soliloquy from Prospero in The Tempest.  This for me was like a spiritual experience, it was so sublime.  Naturally,  I hope that he wins although Christopher Plummer appears to the stern competition this year winning several awards in the runup including the Golden Globe.When I left this movie I felt optimistic and relieved at finally seeing a good movie.  Shortly afterwards all the best movies were released in time for an Oscar run including  The Descendants,  The Artist, Warhorse, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Hugo.  So, if you want to be an Oscar contender release your movie in December.Recently we have seen a trend in the Academy Awards toward real life characters with Marion Cotillard winning for  portraying Edith Piaf, Helen Mirren for playing the queen, Colin Firth for playing a king, Christian Bale for playing an addict.

Michelle Williams is definitely beautiful, but she lacks that amazing charm and charisma that Marilyn possessed. Williams was better in the more melancholic, painful scenes, but it was frustrating, it could've been a much better character study.Even if the film is a true story, it comes off as too much of a school boy fantasy, and the main character can hardly gain sympathy for playing the girl next door and then running off with the lead actress. The direction of the film told the story, but it lacked a memorable iconic moment. Lets get a few shots of Marilyn by herself, or at least some archival footage of the real Marilyn.

1451040,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0059XTUB8,Mark Turner,"[0, 2]","Marilyn Monroe was an icon of beauty, of Hollywood leading ladies. To this day images of Monroe can be found on everything from posters to shot glasses. She is an image that film fans carry on even though many of them may never have taken the time to see one of her movies. Such is the price of fame and also a bit of the story seen in MY WEEK WITH MARILYN.The movie is based on the true story of Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), a young man who intends to not follow in the family footsteps but to become involved in the world of film making as he sets out on his own. Determined to get a job, he applies but is turned down for a position with Olivier Films, the studio overseen by Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh). Through sheer determination and with a little luck, he gets a job there and is soon the third assistant director on Olivier's new film. In essence, he becomes a gofer.It is 1956 and Olivier is about to begin his first non-Shakespearean movie, a romantic comedy called ""The Prince and the Showgirl"". Starring as well as directing he has chosen a Hollywood star on the rise as his co-star, Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams). But things start off bad and seem to get worse. Monroe is a method actor, taking time to work herself into the role she is playing while the cast and crew wait. Colin is sent to fetch her to the set and finds himself in awe; completely star stuck, but does get her there.As each day progresses tempers flare and Monroe continues with her temperamental attitude. Those that surround her like her acting coach and manager continue to pamper her and keep up the steady flow of prescription medication. Their goal is to stay with the gravy train and ride it for all it's worth. Colin enters and instead tries to offer her a friend that she doesn't have.After Marilyn's new husband Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) returns to the U.S. to visit his children, Marilyn drops into another depression and calls Colin to her aid. Even though he was threatened by her manager, his devotion to the legendary actress continues. With the help of Colin as he distracts her and gives her the chance to share who she really is as opposed to the celebrity she has become, Marilyn does eventually finish the film. But at what cost?The film fluctuates between two ideas and combines them to make an interesting feature. On the one hand we see the star seeking star treatment that then turns into a gifted talent. So great is her talent that Olivier even comments that she is a natural to Colin late in the film.The other story is of a young girl who has seen the world, who has done what it takes to get where she is and who has lost something in the process. This is a fractured woman who feels she can't escape the caricature she has portrayed because it was after all fame, attention and love that she sought to begin with. But none of those around her truly care about the woman and seem more interested in the character. Except Colin, the young man who gets to know the real woman.Don't think that the movie revolves around a physical love story. It's more about Colin's infatuation that becomes adoration and Marilyn's need for someone to accept her for nothing more than who she really is. In the end there is no way that this romance of sorts can happen or continue. Such is the price of fame.Williams was nominated for an Oscar for her performance here. I'm not sure that it was that outstanding but she does a fine job. The performance is less about her ability to look like Monroe and more about her acting like her in the scenes of the movie being filmed and to portray her troubled psyche off screen. She does an amazing job.More amazing to me was Branagh as Olivier with the same swagger and vocal patterns that fans of Olivier will notice right away. As always he turns in a great performance. Redmayne displays the innocence of a young man and fanatical side of a person infatuated with a star.On the whole the movie is entertaining and enlightening. Will I watch it time and again? Probably not. But the movie is worth seeing at least once. With any luck it will help prevent a future actress from selling her soul to achieve her dream.",3,AN ICON CONTINUES,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4169,"['Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'was', 'icon', 'beauty', 'Hollywood', 'leading', 'ladies', 'day', 'Monroe', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'everything', 'posters', 'shot', 'glasses', 'image', 'film', 'fans', 'carry', 'even', 'many', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'taken', 'time', 'see', 'one', 'movies', 'Such', 'price', 'fame', 'also', 'bit', 'story', 'seen', 'MY', 'WEEK', 'WITH', 'MARILYN.The', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'follow', 'family', 'footsteps', 'become', 'involved', 'world', 'film', 'making', 'out', 'own', 'Determined', 'get', 'job', 'turned', 'down', 'position', 'Olivier', 'Films', 'studio', 'overseen', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'sheer', 'determination', 'little', 'luck', 'job', 'there', 'soon', 'third', 'assistant', 'director', 'Olivier', 'new', 'film', 'essence', 'gofer.It', '1956', 'Olivier', 'begin', 'first', 'non-Shakespearean', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'called', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'Starring', 'as', 'well', 'directing', 'chosen', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'rise', 'co-star', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'things', 'start', 'bad', 'seem', 'get', 'worse', 'Monroe', 'method', 'actor', 'taking', 'time', 'work', 'role', 'playing', 'cast', 'crew', 'wait', 'Colin', 'sent', 'fetch', 'set', 'awe', 'completely', 'star', 'stuck', 'get', 'there.As', 'day', 'tempers', 'flare', 'Monroe', 'temperamental', 'attitude', 'surround', 'acting', 'coach', 'manager', 'continue', 'pamper', 'keep', 'up', 'steady', 'flow', 'prescription', 'medication', 'goal', 'stay', 'gravy', 'train', 'ride', 'worth', 'Colin', 'enters', 'instead', 'tries', 'offer', 'friend', ""n't"", 'have.After', 'Marilyn', 'new', 'husband', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'U.S.', 'visit', 'children', 'Marilyn', 'depression', 'Colin', 'aid', 'Even', 'was', 'threatened', 'manager', 'devotion', 'legendary', 'actress', 'help', 'Colin', 'chance', 'share', 'who', 'really', 'opposed', 'celebrity', 'become', 'Marilyn', 'eventually', 'finish', 'film', 'what', 'cost', 'film', 'fluctuates', 'two', 'ideas', 'combines', 'make', 'interesting', 'feature', 'one', 'hand', 'see', 'star', 'seeking', 'star', 'treatment', 'then', 'gifted', 'talent', 'So', 'great', 'talent', 'Olivier', 'even', 'comments', 'natural', 'Colin', 'late', 'film.The', 'other', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'seen', 'world', 'who', 'done', 'what', 'get', 'where', 'who', 'lost', 'something', 'process', 'fractured', 'woman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'caricature', 'portrayed', 'was', 'fame', 'attention', 'love', 'sought', 'begin', 'none', 'truly', 'care', 'woman', 'seem', 'more', 'interested', 'character', 'Colin', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'know', 'real', 'woman.Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'around', 'physical', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'Colin', 'infatuation', 'adoration', 'Marilyn', 'need', 'someone', 'accept', 'nothing', 'more', 'who', 'really', 'end', 'way', 'romance', 'sorts', 'can', 'happen', 'continue', 'Such', 'price', 'fame.Williams', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'outstanding', 'fine', 'job', 'performance', 'less', 'ability', 'look', 'Monroe', 'more', 'acting', 'scenes', 'movie', 'being', 'filmed', 'portray', 'troubled', 'psyche', 'screen', 'amazing', 'job.More', 'amazing', 'was', 'Branagh', 'Olivier', 'same', 'swagger', 'vocal', 'patterns', 'fans', 'Olivier', 'will', 'notice', 'right', 'away', 'always', 'great', 'performance', 'Redmayne', 'innocence', 'young', 'man', 'fanatical', 'side', 'person', 'infatuated', 'star.On', 'whole', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'enlightening', 'Will', 'watch', 'time', 'again', 'Probably', 'not', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once', 'luck', 'will', 'help', 'prevent', 'future', 'actress', 'selling', 'soul', 'achieve', 'dream']",My Week with Marilyn

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[2, 4]","Marilyn Monroe has been portrayed many times on the screen, but never as sensitively or believably as with Michelle Williams' Oscar-nominated performance in MY WEEK WITH MARILYN, now available in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment.Indeed, Ms. Williams becomes Marilyn to the point where one forgets that one is watching a movie about Marilyn Monroe and believes that that is the real person up on the screen.The film, directed by Simon Curtis, is based on a memoir by Colin Clark that details his experience as a 3rd assistant director on the troubled film, THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL, which starred Monroe and Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh), who also directed that 1956 release.  Marilyn was newly wed to Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) when she traveled to London for the first time in order to make the picture, and the playwright was having a difficult time dealing with her neuroses.  When he took a brief trip back to New York, Clark (Eddie Redmayne) was conscripted by Marilyn for a week to be her emotional support.The casting of the movie is letter perfect.  I can imagine no other actor than Branagh as Olivier and, as with Williams, he quickly makes you believe that you are actually watching the legendary British actor in person.  Redmayne is very likable as the young novice Clark, as are Judi Dench as Dame Sybil Thorndike and Julia Osmond as Vivien Leigh.MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is a charming, thoroughly entertaining film that not only give viewers a realistic look at a nostalgic era of movie-making, but also an insider's viewpoint of some of that time's most revered figures.

1451048,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B0059XTUB8,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","My week with Marilyn tells the story of the filming of the movie The Prince and The Showgirl from the late 1950s.  Specifically how the third assistant director on the film (or gopher as is more aptly titled) played by Eddie Redmayne befriended and ultimately fell in love with Marilyn Monroe, played by Michelle Williams.  It does a great job telling the story of how unreliable she could be to work with and how Laurence Olivier, portrayed wonderfully by Kenneth Branagh, who was the star and director of that movie both despised, and was in awe of Marilyn.  He put up with her both because, he was trying to use her appeal as being the biggest actress in the world at the time to revive his lagging career and because he wanted to sleep with her.For Williams part, although she did not have the appeal of Marilyn (although lets face it few actresses before her or since could even come close) she did very well at showing her vulnerability, flaws and loneliness.  She did a good job at showing that the public face Marilyn gave was just an act, and was not really her.  And while the movie does not deal with her death, it certainly sows the seeds of the fact that it was that duality and both not wanting the fame, but not being able to give it up that caused her to drink and become more and more dependent on pills to function which ultimately led to her death.As for extras on the blu ray there is a commentary track on the movie and a 20min making of/behind the scenes feature.

1451049,A1FG91CM8221X1,B0059XTUB8,Miles D. Moore,"[13, 19]","Simon Curtis' ""My Week with Marilyn"" tells all in the title. It's the story of Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), an aristocratic, well-ccnnected young Englishman, and how he had a brief fling with Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) while serving as a production assistant on the film ""The Prince and the Showgirl."" The film, though very well-made, is pretty much a trifle, except for the astonishing performances of Williams and of Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier.Seeing production stills before I saw the movie, I didn't know how Williams was going to bring off playing Monroe; with her round, girlish face, she looks nothing like Monroe, and being dressed, made up and coiffed in full Marilyn drag only emphasizes her lack of resemblance. But this turned out to make no difference, for Williams becomes Monroe to the life, capturing her incandescence, her crippling insecurities, her manipulative flirtatiousness. If there is a more consistently impressive young American actress than Michelle Williams, I don't know who it might be.Like Williams, Branagh bears no physical resemblance whatever to the world-famous actor he's playing, though his resume makes him a natural to play Olivier (even down to his directing and starring in his own versions of ""Hamlet"" and ""Henry V""). Branagh nicely captures Olivier's magnificence of voice and gesture, but even more, he captures something of Olivier's soul. Watch Branagh's close-ups, and particularly his eyes; on several occasions his eyes have that wild, imperious look that Olivier alone had, and no other actor in cinematic history.I was less impressed with Eddie Redmayne; he was likable, but essentially just Richie Cunningham with a posh accent. The rest of the players, though, are superb. I was particularly gratified to see Judi Dench playing Dame Sybil Thorndike as a fount of thespian and worldly wisdom. Emma Watson, Derek Jacobi, Zoe Wanamaker, Philip Jackson, Toby Jones, Dominic Cooper and Julia Ormond also acquit themselves well. ""My Week with Marilyn"" is well worth seeing as a splendid showing for British Rep, as well as one American interloper.",4,Two great performances make this a must-see.,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,2114,"['Simon', 'Curtis', 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'title', 'story', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'aristocratic', 'well-ccnnected', 'young', 'Englishman', 'how', 'had', 'brief', 'fling', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'while', 'serving', 'production', 'assistant', 'film', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'film', 'very', 'well-made', 'pretty', 'much', 'trifle', 'astonishing', 'performances', 'Williams', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Laurence', 'Olivier.Seeing', 'production', 'stills', 'saw', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Williams', 'was', 'going', 'bring', 'off', 'playing', 'Monroe', 'round', 'girlish', 'face', 'nothing', 'Monroe', 'being', 'dressed', 'made', 'up', 'coiffed', 'full', 'Marilyn', 'drag', 'only', 'lack', 'resemblance', 'turned', 'out', 'make', 'difference', 'Williams', 'Monroe', 'life', 'capturing', 'incandescence', 'crippling', 'insecurities', 'manipulative', 'flirtatiousness', 'more', 'consistently', 'impressive', 'young', 'American', 'actress', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'might', 'be.Like', 'Williams', 'Branagh', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'world-famous', 'actor', 'playing', 'resume', 'natural', 'play', 'Olivier', 'even', 'down', 'directing', 'starring', 'own', 'versions', 'Hamlet', 'Henry', 'V', 'Branagh', 'nicely', 'Olivier', 'magnificence', 'voice', 'gesture', 'even', 'more', 'something', 'Olivier', 'soul', 'Watch', 'Branagh', 'close-ups', 'particularly', 'eyes', 'several', 'occasions', 'eyes', 'have', 'wild', 'imperious', 'look', 'Olivier', 'alone', 'had', 'other', 'actor', 'cinematic', 'history.I', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'was', 'likable', 'essentially', 'just', 'Richie', 'Cunningham', 'posh', 'accent', 'rest', 'players', 'are', 'superb', 'was', 'particularly', 'gratified', 'see', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'playing', 'Dame', 'Sybil', 'Thorndike', 'fount', 'thespian', 'worldly', 'wisdom', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Zoe', 'Wanamaker', 'Philip', 'Jackson', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'also', 'acquit', 'well', 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'splendid', 'showing', 'British', 'Rep', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'American', 'interloper']",My Week with Marilyn

1451051,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0059XTUB8,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","""My Week with  Marilyn"" follows the behind-the-scenes social intrigues of the cast and crew of ""The Prince and the Showgirl"", Laurence Olivier's attempt at light comedy on the silver screen and Marilyn Monroe's attempt to work with serious folks, in 1956. The film's troubled production, which was apparently far more engaging than the movie itself, was recorded for posterity by Colin Clark, whose first job in the film industry was third assistant director on that film, essentially a factotum and assistant to Laurence Olivier. Clark was 23 years old at the time and enamored of Marilyn Monroe. He published a diary of his time on the set as ""The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me"" in 1995, followed by a memoir from which this film takes its name in 2000.Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) is from an old and monied English family that doesn't think much of his aspiration to a career in movies. But his persistence gets him a job with Laurence Olivier Productions, whose next film will be ""The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me"". Colin couldn't be happier at the prospect of meeting the glamorous, beautiful and very American Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams). The production is off to a rocky start, when Marilyn is late to the first read-through, and it's clear that she is more than a little nervous, insecure, and doped-up. Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) becomes frustrated with Monroe's personal problems and her ""method"" approach to acting. Meanwhile, Marilyn finds Colin a down to earth person to talk to in her time of crisis.Laurence Olivier is intimidating and perhaps not as tolerant as he could have been of Marilyn's perpetual emotional turmoil, but I found him the most sympathetic character. He is bedeviled by Marilyn Monroe's dysfunction, which is creating a hellish working environment for him. But trying to compete with Marilyn's screen presence and sexuality leaves him in awe of her on one level.  He was a middle aged man seeking to renew and rediscover his strengths through a beautiful younger woman, but seeing himself on screen with her only made him feel old. And working with her nearly drove him mad. It's nice to see Kenneth Branagh playing a forceful character who is not always nice. I liked him in this role a lot.Michelle Williams is perfectly competent as Marilyn Monroe: childlike, witty, dreadfully insecure, preyed upon, but manipulative and toxic to those whose emotions she toys with. Colin Clark was too green to understand that he could get hurt trying to be Marilyn's friend -and that no one, especially not a man, could really be her friend. But he was captivated by her, and she thought him innocent enough to be trusted. Colin Clark's character, while a reasonably good lens through which to see the others, is unfortunately the film's weakness. He is flat and doesn't have as much stake in how the production turns out as the other characters, which makes him less compelling. This is a star-packed cast that works nicely, but our guide, Colin, is the weak point.The DVD (Weinstein 2012): Bonus features are a behind-the-scenes documentary and an audio commentary. ""The Untold Story of an American Icon"" (31 min) interviews director Simon Curtis and the cast about the film, the characters, and performances. Then it goes to Pinewood Studios, where filming for both Olivier and Monroe's film and this film took place, for a look behind the scenes. The audio commentary with director Simon Curtis is constant scene-by-scene commentary about story, characters, locations, and changes made to the book, which seem minor.

1451053,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0059XTUB8,M. Oleson,"[3, 5]","Marilyn Monroe was and still is a bit of a mystery.  In her heyday, she was considered by most to be just a glamorized sexpot used as eye candy in most of her films.  A look back generally shows she had significant acting talent, especially in the right roles.  As this film adaptation of Colin Clark's memoir indicates, Marilyn also comes with a lot of baggage.  Director Simon Curtis personalizes Monroe's struggles with confidence, older men and pills.The film is set in 1956 England where Laurence Olivier (a wonderful Kenneth Branaugh) is starring and directing ""The Prince and the Showgirl."" Monroe (Michelle Williams), then one of the most recognizable people on the planet, finally arrives and drives everyone on the set crazy.  And we're wondering if she doesn't have a bit of crazy in her as well.  Some of these early scenes seem to drag a bit.  OK, we get it.  But I think, it does put Monroe in bad light and I suspect that is the idea.  Then Michelle Williams really goes to work.  Her ultimate relationship with Clark (Eddie Redmayne) brings out the real Monroe.  She was neglected if not abused as a child.  She didn't know her father, but all of her squires have been older men.  Now she meets a 23 year old (""almost 24"" Clark insists) gofer on a movie set.  Monroe is 30 at the time.  After a tender kiss, she says ""I've never kissed anyone younger than me.""Williams once again proves her acting chops in a stellar, award-worthy performance.  Her Monroe is vulnerable, needy and wants to truly be loved.  She wants a ""normal"" life and wants to have children.  These are not the same desires of her new husband, writer Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) or any of her other previous mates.  As Clark had been warned by her former beau and agent Milton Greene (Dominic Cooper), Monroe is a heartbreaker.  But with Williams's performance, damn if I wasn't falling in love at the same time Clark was.

Was I wrong! Although there is little physical similarity to Marilyn Monroe, Ms Williams gives us a performance that captures the charm and the insecurities of the film icon. In addition, we are treated to her delightful interpretations of Marilyn singing ""Heatwave"" and ""That Old Black Magic.""The movie is based Clark's story of the filming of ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" In London. Kenneth Branagh gives an entertaining performance as Sir Laurence Olivier, driven more than slightly batty by Marilyn's lateness, her insecurity about her ability as an actress (reinforced by Olivier shouting at her just to be sexy, as wasn't that what she did), and her neediness just a few weeks into her marriage to playwrite Arthur Miller. Clark, played by Eddie Redmayne, is the third assistant director who befriends Marilyn and with whom he has a friendship even though he must defy the powers that be in order to do so.Redmayne is perfect as the young (23 year old) aspiring director, whose prominent and intellectually oriented family seems to find his ambitions childish. His infatuation with Marilyn is obvious to all, even though he insists it is primarily professional. Dominic Cooper and Julia Ormand are mostly wasted as Arthur Miller and Vivian Leigh, while Dame Judi Dench gives her usual entertaining performance in a minor role. Emma Watson plays Redmanyne's love interest among the production staff, a relationship that seems doomed from the start due to the English class differences between their respective families. For those of us who love books about movies and movies about movies this is just about perfect. Ms Williams playing the actress being herself with Colin but then ""becoming Marilyn"" when a group of university students appear suddenly was absolutely brilliant. She certainly deserved her Academy Award nomination as Best Actress for this performance.

This is too often an overambitious target of filmmakers to pack a life into one film, but the selection of a set period of time was a masterstroke by Curtis, which allowed for deeper immersion of Monroe over a short period of time.The viewer is easily enchanted by the beauty and complexity of Monroe, and Clark is a faithful friend and servant to her, who gets to see the person behind the star.Nicholas R.W.

The film is culled from the diaries of Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) who worked as a third assistant director on the film The Prince & The Showgirl which is depicted in the movie. In the film, Ms. Monroe develops a trust and shares what may or may not have been an intimate relationship with Mr. Clark.  Ms. Williams may seem like an odd choice to play Marilyn since she really doesn't bear much resemblance to her other than having blonde hair, she does an amazing job capturing her spirit.  She has the whispery voice and the playful ing&eacute;nue aspects of Ms. Monroe's personality down pat.

1451067,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B0059XTUB8,"Promise ""promise""","[2, 3]","It's a semi-interesting film, depending on the ongoing popularity of Marilyn Monroe to sell it.  'Sort of like the many films about Jackie Kennedy and Princess Di.  This one is patterned after an alleged almost-romance with a young English fellow who worked on the set of the film she made with Lawrence Olivier.  I think the problem, other than the difficulty of finding anyone to do justice to Marilyn, is that the story is so thin.  It's about this Englishman who manages to get a job on the film set and then again manages to spend a little time with her.  It's more about him than about her but of course no one cares about him.  If they had had a real romance that might have been more of a story...but apparently this was little more than a school boy crush....a few encounters that he embellished greatly in his own imagination....wrote a book about it and now this film. You have to give him credit for parlay something very slight into a major motion picture.As others have said, Michelle Williams does a wonderful job in an impossible task....who could play such a person?  Michelle captures the vulnerability, innocence, and lost-child qualities of Marilyn beautifully.  What she lacks is the  sheer sexiness.  Her scenes where she is &#34;successful&#34; in the film, playing the naughty showgirl are not convincing, and almost embarrassing.  The fellow who plays Colin, the young star struck fellow, is good as the innocent caught up in first love.  Emma Roberts is noteworthy in a small role as the wardrobe girl (not the acting coach as the Amazon reviewer stated.).  Kenneth Branagh is one dimensional as a constantly annoyed Lawrence Olivier.  I had to wonder if the real Olivier was that mean.  Also suspect to me was the character of Paula Strasburg, who was portrayed as almost an evil enabler of Marilyn's unreliabiltiy.Since the story line is so flimsy and hard to beileve, the success of the film rests on the somewhat fragile shoulders of Michelle Williams to convince all the viewers that she is Marilyn.  It's a terribly difficult job and she does a heroic job, but that's not enough to make a  totally satisfying film.",3,Sweet but not satisfying,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,2146,"['semi-interesting', 'film', 'depending', 'ongoing', 'popularity', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'sell', ""'Sort"", 'many', 'films', 'Jackie', 'Kennedy', 'Princess', 'Di', 'one', 'patterned', 'alleged', 'almost-romance', 'young', 'English', 'fellow', 'who', 'worked', 'set', 'film', 'made', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'think', 'problem', 'other', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'anyone', 'do', 'justice', 'Marilyn', 'story', 'so', 'thin', 'Englishman', 'who', 'get', 'job', 'film', 'set', 'then', 'again', 'spend', 'little', 'time', 'more', 'course', 'one', 'had', 'had', 'real', 'romance', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'story', 'apparently', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'school', 'boy', 'crush', 'few', 'encounters', 'embellished', 'greatly', 'own', 'imagination', '.wrote', 'book', 'now', 'film', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'parlay', 'something', 'very', 'slight', 'major', 'motion', 'picture.As', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'wonderful', 'job', 'impossible', 'task', '.who', 'could', 'play', 'person', 'Michelle', 'vulnerability', 'innocence', 'lost-child', 'qualities', 'Marilyn', 'beautifully', 'What', 'sheer', 'sexiness', 'scenes', 'where', '34', 'successful', '34', 'film', 'playing', 'naughty', 'showgirl', 'are', 'not', 'convincing', 'almost', 'embarrassing', 'fellow', 'who', 'Colin', 'young', 'star', 'struck', 'fellow', 'good', 'innocent', 'caught', 'up', 'first', 'love', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'noteworthy', 'small', 'role', 'wardrobe', 'girl', 'not', 'acting', 'coach', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'stated.', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'one', 'dimensional', 'constantly', 'annoyed', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'had', 'wonder', 'real', 'Olivier', 'was', 'mean', 'Also', 'suspect', 'was', 'character', 'Paula', 'Strasburg', 'who', 'was', 'portrayed', 'almost', 'evil', 'enabler', 'Marilyn', 'unreliabiltiy.Since', 'story', 'line', 'so', 'flimsy', 'hard', 'beileve', 'success', 'film', 'somewhat', 'fragile', 'shoulders', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'convince', 'viewers', 'Marilyn', 'terribly', 'difficult', 'job', 'heroic', 'job', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'totally', 'satisfying', 'film']",My Week with Marilyn

In this movie, she shines; she is the perfect pick to play Marilyn Monroe.  From start to finish, her performance is strong and convincing.  Story is told from point of view of a young man Colin, from privileged upper class (he is British) who wants to make his own way in the movie business.  He is only 23 and is well connected; his godfather is royal librarian and his family personally knows sir Laurence Olivier, one of the greatest clasically trained actors of his time.As Olivier decides to make a movie in which he will start with Marylin Monroe, young Colin gets determiend to become part of the director's team.  He uses his connections to find out names of the people who can arrange Marilyn's stay in England by finding her a quiet and secluded house rental dutring the week of her filming with Olivier.  When Marilyn finally arrives, with her husband of three weeks, writer Arthur Miller, everyone is smitten.  Her presence is magnetic, but her insecurities, her tardiness and blind devotion to her acting coach is driving everyone mad. When Miller leaves her during filming to visit his family, Marilyn strikes friendship with young Colin.  He seems to be the only one to give her a peak to what it is to live ordinary life, without any pressures of Hollywood, fame and relentless admirers, journalists and photographers.  During the week that they are together, Colin gives Marilyn kind of friendship she deparately craves. Colin falls in love with Marilyn and pays the price in the process; his brief relationship with costume girl from the crew falters, Marilyn returns to her husband and Hollywood and Colin's unique experience helps him establish himself as a professional, capable of joining ""the circus"" as Laurence Olivier tells him at the end.This is extraordinary film because it gives a glimpse of Marylin from a perspective of a young man, still uncorrupted and innocent.  Like most life changing events, for Colin this moment in his life is a kind of experience he will never be able to shake off.  But it is also his way of making his own way in the real world of which he knows so little about...This movie is based on a memoir, Colin Clark wrote in 1990s about the experience from 1956.",5,Michelle Williams at her best,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,2286,"['doubt', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'movie', 'perfect', 'pick', 'play', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'start', 'finish', 'performance', 'strong', 'convincing', 'Story', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'young', 'man', 'Colin', 'privileged', 'upper', 'class', 'British', 'who', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'movie', 'business', 'only', '23', 'well', 'connected', 'godfather', 'royal', 'librarian', 'family', 'personally', 'sir', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'one', 'greatest', 'clasically', 'trained', 'actors', 'time.As', 'Olivier', 'make', 'movie', 'will', 'start', 'Marylin', 'Monroe', 'young', 'Colin', 'determiend', 'become', 'part', 'director', 'team', 'connections', 'find', 'out', 'names', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'arrange', 'Marilyn', 'stay', 'England', 'finding', 'quiet', 'secluded', 'house', 'rental', 'dutring', 'week', 'filming', 'Olivier', 'When', 'Marilyn', 'finally', 'husband', 'three', 'weeks', 'writer', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'everyone', 'smitten', 'presence', 'magnetic', 'insecurities', 'tardiness', 'blind', 'devotion', 'acting', 'coach', 'driving', 'everyone', 'mad', 'When', 'Miller', 'filming', 'visit', 'family', 'Marilyn', 'friendship', 'young', 'Colin', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'give', 'peak', 'what', 'live', 'ordinary', 'life', 'pressures', 'Hollywood', 'fame', 'relentless', 'admirers', 'journalists', 'photographers', 'week', 'are', 'together', 'Colin', 'Marilyn', 'kind', 'friendship', 'deparately', 'Colin', 'love', 'Marilyn', 'price', 'process', 'brief', 'relationship', 'costume', 'girl', 'crew', 'falters', 'Marilyn', 'husband', 'Hollywood', 'Colin', 'unique', 'experience', 'establish', 'professional', 'capable', 'joining', 'circus', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'end.This', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'glimpse', 'Marylin', 'perspective', 'young', 'man', 'still', 'uncorrupted', 'innocent', 'most', 'life', 'changing', 'events', 'Colin', 'moment', 'life', 'kind', 'experience', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'shake', 'off', 'also', 'way', 'making', 'own', 'way', 'real', 'world', 'so', 'little', 'movie', 'based', 'memoir', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'wrote', '1990s', 'experience', '1956']",My Week with Marilyn

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[1, 1]","Marilyn Monroe was still a huge star when I reached my teens just as &#34;The Prince and the Showgirl&#34; was being filmed in 1957. I had a huge crush on her...just as most kids my age and older. I saw many of her films in the theater back then and have viewed most of them since. She was a huge star of course (ranked #6 among all female actors by AFI) and sex symbol; and with the right role and direction, she was also an excellent actress. I never knew back then how troubled and fragile and insecure she was; how difficult she was to work with; or about her prescription drug and alcohol abuse. This film is only a mini-biopic of Marilyn, but it does a great job of portraying her as she was in 1957, when she had already started down the road that led to her premature death. Michelle Williams, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Monroe, and is also drop-dead gorgeous, performs masterfully in the title role. Eddie Redmayne, in a breakout performance, also performs superbly as the young starstruck assistant director, Colin Clark, who is assigned to keep up w/Marilyn; and in the process, gains her confidence and falls in love w/her. The story is fact based, adapted from Clark's two books on his time w/Marilyn in 1957. The director and co-star of &#34;The Prince and the Showgirl&#34;, was the great actor, Sir Lawrence Olivier, played by Kenneth Branagh, in his usual outstanding manner. Also look for excellent performances from Judi Dench who plays actress, Sybil Thorndike; and Emma Watson, in one of her first roles outside the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; series; as a wardrobe assistant, who is Colin's love interest before and after his week with Marilyn.

1451077,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0059XTUB8,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 1]","First, some background. This film encompasses the summer of 1956, in which Marilyn Monroe travelled to London in order to star alongside Lawrence Olivier inThe Prince and the Showgirl, a light romantic comedy. She was hoping to gain some credit as a serious actress, whilst he (or at least the version of him that exists in this film) wants to recapture his youth. And how better to do that than opposite the world's most desirable actress? Marilyn was still six years away from her death-by-overdose in 1962, but that foreknowledge casts a shadow over the entire film, for the cracks in her life and psyche that ultimately drive her to her untimely end are apparent throughout.Based on the memoirs of Colin Clark, a twenty-three year old at the time, he shares in his biographic accountMy Week with Marilynthat he - well, quite obviously spent time with the famous movie star. As third assistant to the director, Clark struck up a friendship with Marilyn that left enough of an impression on him that he was compelled to write about it many years later in the book of the same name, and upon which this screenplay is based.It's really quite a simple bio-pic, chronicling the behind-the-scenes drama of the filming of ""The Prince and the Showgirl"", as well as portraying snippets of the movie itself and Colin Clark's budding relationship with Marilyn. The woman was notoriously difficult to work with on-set, keeping her co-stars waiting for hours while she prepared and frustrating the director with her attempts to get inside her character's head even though the role itself was feather-light. The stress gets to her, and it's only when she reaches out to Clark as a confidante that things begin to get back on track - though this comes at a heavy personal cost to Clark.The film is jam-packed full of British thespians playing other British thespians. Kenneth Branagh as Lawrence Olivier, Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh and Judi Dench as Dame Sybil Thorndike, as well as Dougray Scott as Marilyn's American husband Arthur Miller, Dominic Cooper as photographer Milton Greene, Zoe Wanamaker as Marilyn's acting coach Paula Strasberg, and Emma Watson as Clark's love interest Lucy (possibly the only fictional character in the whole piece). Heck, even Derek Jacobi pops in for a brief cameo.Some of these actors are better showcased than others, but in their short amount of time, each one manages to not only project an understanding of their own character, but to demonstrate just how much of a turbulent impact Marilyn had on their lives. As the protagonist, Eddie Remayne does his best with a wafer-thin character, but let's face it - in a role that requires little beyond looking dazed and awestruck, he simply exists as an audience surrogate for viewers to experience the Marilyn effect. Most of the time he just stares at the actress in awe, and as early as the first three seconds of the film, in which his voice-over narration is discussing his background, you're already thinking: ""who cares? Get to Marilyn!""And it is Michelle William's performance as Marilyn that naturally provides the film its purpose, a challenge that she tackles with remarkable self-possession. Who would have thought that the girl fromDawson's Creekhad this in her? In her hands, it's easy to see why the world was so captivated by the woman she plays, and Williams captures Marilyn's breathy speech patterns, fragile beauty, effortless sensuality and enigmatic nature with eerie accuracy. The entire purpose of the movie is really a character-study of one of the most famous film actresses of all time, and you find yourself scrutinizing her every time she's on-screen. At times confident, skittish, cheerful, seductive, vulnerable, childish and desperately unhappy, it's difficult to pin her down - which is precisely what makes her so alluring.While watching, you begin to wonder: it is Marilyn's personality or the mystique surrounding her that enchants everyone? Is she really as vulnerable and helpless as she seems, or does she know exactly what she's doing when she makes the rest of the cast wait hours for her? What is hurting her more, her army of sycophants or her impatient critics? And who has the woman's true measure? Lawrence Olivier loses his patience with her on more than one occasion, yet ultimately acknowledges that her instinctual ability to work the camera is like nothing he's ever seen before. Vivien Leigh sees only a beautiful young starlet that reminds her of her own advancing age. Clingy Paula Strasberg does more harm than good when it comes to coaching Marilyn in method acting. Arthur Miller confesses that his wife ""is devouring me,"" whilst Milton Greene jealously warns Clark that Marilyn's only interest is in breaking hearts. Sybil Thorndike is gently encouraging, and Clark is just hopelessly smitten.The final conclusion drawn is that despite her apparent instability, a woman like Marilyn Monroe needs to be as tough as nails to make it in Hollywood - though her eventual fate surely puts a damper on this interpretation. Yet as she says to Clark in the movie's final moments; as much as her lifestyle is harming her, she cannot do without it - demonstrated by a telling little scene in which she and Clark are accosted by a group of fans, Marilyn whispers: ""shall I be her?"" and so instantly transforms from a demure young woman to a smoldering sexpot.The time period is beautifully rendered through costuming, location and props, and despite the film's rather slow pacing and lack of any real narrative drive (in my father's words: ""this was the most boring movie I've ever seen"") those who are interested in the subject matter of old films and the actors/actresses that starred in them may be intrigued by what ""My Week With Marilyn"" has to share.",4,"""That's What She Does, She Breaks

1451078,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0059XTUB8,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","Although I have enjoyed my share of Marilyn Monroe movies, I've never been obsessed with her or made it my business to read biographical info on her.  I certainly know she died young, was married to DiMaggio & Miller, etc.  Thus, I cannot speak even remotely to the truthfulness of MY WEEK WITH MARILYN.  I can say, however, that it was an interesting film that engaged my interest throughout, and that it features an eye-opening performance from Michelle Williams.MY WEEK WITH MARILYN covers the time period when Marilyn came over to England to star in Laurence Olivier's PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL.  Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) was directing and co-starring, and felt that Monroe would guarantee a big hit.  For me, as someone who worked for YEARS in theater, I was in many ways most interested in seeing the clash of acting styles between Monroe & Olivier.  Monroe was trying to be a method actor (and she travelled with her own acting coach)...which sometimes seems like a crutch she is using when she's feeling insecure.  Olivier was more old-school, where acting was more about craft and instinct and timing and delivery.  When the two great movie stars come together, sparks fly.  But they aren't the sparks that create movie magic...they create friction and frustration.  I enjoyed watching all the British actors struggling to deal with Monroe's ""method"" of acting.  (Best of the bunch was watching Judi Dench, doing all she could to help Marilyn...she gives a delightful performance in a tiny role.)The movie is told from the point of view of Third Assistant Director Colin Clark (on whose memoir the film is based).  Clark is a young man, new to the film business, who essentially is the gopher for Olivier and everyone else involved in the film.  He forges an unlikely friendship with Monroe, who briefly comes to trust him more than anyone else around.  This alliance lasts about a week (hence the title), where Colin is practically living with Monroe, even sleeping in her bed to offer comfort.  There are broad hints that some of Monroe's erratic behavior is due to drugs, but for the most part, the film portrays her as very insecure and lonely and misunderstood.  While the film doesn't shy away from the ugly aspects of her life, it is safe to say they are left unexplored.The film is a fairly loving tribute to Monroe.  While she can be difficult, she is always shown fairly sympathetically.  Actually, almost everyone in the film is sympathetic.  Olivier occasionally blusters and acts out...but honestly, we can understand his frustration.  Overall, he comes off well.  The movie FEELS evenhanded and humane...it's a nice mood.Best of all is Michelle Williams.  She's done good work before, but much of it has felt SIMILAR.  She seems to play contemporary women grappling with some level of demons.  (BLUE VALENTINE, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN).  Her characters may have inner strength (MEEK'S CUTOFF, WENDY AND LUCY), but they aren't usually dynamic, charismatic, loud women.  In MY WEEK WITH MARILYN, we see a side of her that has not been much on display, and my estimation of her jumped up accordingly.  Her Marilyn is touching and grappling with demons, but she is also sexy and wildly charismatic.  When Williams portrays the ""public"" Marilyn, handling rabid fans or a crazy press conference...she acts so ""non-Michelle Williams-like"" that I was quite impressed.  Her many accolades were much deserved.  Branagh also does a great Olivier.  It's perhaps a bit more of an impression that a fully-realized performance...but he's charming and convincing and clearly having a ball with the role.  Others don't fare quite as well.  Emma Watson is bland (thanks to the script) as Colin's girlfriend; Dougray Scott doesn't get to do much as Arthur Miller and Julia Ormond is miscast as Olivier's wife, Vivien Leigh.This is not a deeply revelatory film, but it is highly entertaining and the time flies by.  The art & costume direction is flawless, including the reconstructions of many scenes from Monroe films.  It's a feel-good film about a real life person who was nearly on the brink of self-destruction.  That's contradictory, I know...but that's how the film felt.  It is certainly worth a look.",4,"Entertaining film, a treat for show-biz lovers",1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,4207,"['have', 'enjoyed', 'share', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'obsessed', 'made', 'business', 'read', 'biographical', 'info', 'certainly', 'know', 'died', 'young', 'was', 'married', 'DiMaggio', 'Miller', 'etc', 'Thus', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'even', 'remotely', 'truthfulness', 'MY', 'WEEK', 'WITH', 'MARILYN', 'can', 'say', 'however', 'was', 'interesting', 'film', 'engaged', 'interest', 'eye-opening', 'performance', 'Michelle', 'Williams.MY', 'WEEK', 'WITH', 'MARILYN', 'time', 'period', 'when', 'Marilyn', 'came', 'England', 'star', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'PRINCE', 'THE', 'SHOWGIRL', 'Olivier', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'was', 'directing', 'co-starring', 'felt', 'Monroe', 'would', 'guarantee', 'big', 'hit', 'someone', 'who', 'worked', 'YEARS', 'theater', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'interested', 'seeing', 'clash', 'acting', 'styles', 'Monroe', 'Olivier', 'Monroe', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'method', 'actor', 'travelled', 'own', 'acting', 'coach', 'sometimes', 'crutch', 'using', 'when', 'feeling', 'insecure', 'Olivier', 'was', 'more', 'old-school', 'where', 'acting', 'was', 'more', 'craft', 'instinct', 'timing', 'delivery', 'When', 'two', 'great', 'movie', 'stars', 'come', 'together', 'sparks', 'fly', 'are', ""n't"", 'sparks', 'create', 'movie', 'magic', 'create', 'friction', 'frustration', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'British', 'actors', 'struggling', 'deal', 'Monroe', 'method', 'acting', 'Best', 'bunch', 'was', 'watching', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'doing', 'could', 'help', 'Marilyn', 'delightful', 'performance', 'tiny', 'role', 'movie', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'Third', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'memoir', 'film', 'based', 'Clark', 'young', 'man', 'new', 'film', 'business', 'who', 'essentially', 'gopher', 'Olivier', 'everyone', 'else', 'involved', 'film', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'Monroe', 'who', 'briefly', 'trust', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'around', 'alliance', 'week', 'hence', 'title', 'where', 'Colin', 'practically', 'living', 'Monroe', 'even', 'sleeping', 'bed', 'offer', 'comfort', 'are', 'broad', 'hints', 'Monroe', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'due', 'drugs', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'very', 'insecure', 'lonely', 'misunderstood', 'film', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'ugly', 'aspects', 'life', 'safe', 'say', 'are', 'left', 'unexplored.The', 'film', 'fairly', 'loving', 'tribute', 'Monroe', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'always', 'shown', 'fairly', 'sympathetically', 'Actually', 'almost', 'everyone', 'film', 'sympathetic', 'Olivier', 'occasionally', 'blusters', 'out', 'honestly', 'can', 'understand', 'frustration', 'Overall', 'off', 'well', 'movie', 'FEELS', 'evenhanded', 'humane', 'nice', 'mood.Best', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'done', 'good', 'work', 'before', 'much', 'felt', 'SIMILAR', 'play', 'contemporary', 'women', 'grappling', 'level', 'demons', 'BLUE', 'VALENTINE', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'characters', 'may', 'have', 'inner', 'strength', 'MEEK', 'CUTOFF', 'WENDY', 'AND', 'LUCY', 'are', ""n't"", 'usually', 'dynamic', 'charismatic', 'loud', 'women', 'MY', 'WEEK', 'WITH', 'MARILYN', 'see', 'side', 'not', 'been', 'much', 'display', 'estimation', 'jumped', 'up', 'accordingly', 'Marilyn', 'touching', 'grappling', 'demons', 'also', 'sexy', 'wildly', 'charismatic', 'When', 'Williams', 'public', 'Marilyn', 'handling', 'rabid', 'fans', 'crazy', 'press', 'conference', 'so', 'non-Michelle', 'Williams-like', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'many', 'accolades', 'were', 'much', 'deserved', 'Branagh', 'also', 'great', 'Olivier', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'more', 'impression', 'fully-realized', 'performance', 'charming', 'convincing', 'clearly', 'having', 'ball', 'role', 'Others', 'do', ""n't"", 'fare', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'bland', 'thanks', 'script', 'Colin', 'girlfriend', 'Dougray', 'Scott', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'much', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'miscast', 'Olivier', 'wife', 'Vivien', 'Leigh.This', 'not', 'deeply', 'revelatory', 'film', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'time', 'flies', 'art', 'costume', 'direction', 'flawless', 'including', 'reconstructions', 'many', 'scenes', 'Monroe', 'films', 'feel-good', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'nearly', 'brink', 'self-destruction', 'contradictory', 'know', 'how', 'film', 'felt', 'certainly', 'worth', 'look']",My Week with Marilyn

1451083,A2UYGOYMV73826,B0059XTUB8,Rushmore,"[0, 0]","I have been watching Smash on TV and am very interested in the actors' efforts to capture the essence of Marilyn, which they mostly do by studying movies, imitating her mannerisms and vocal inflections.  I guess that works best for TV.  Marilyn as a person and as a character has been capturing our imagination for more than 60 years.When Michelle Williams walks into the frame, she IS Marilyn.  She seems to have gone beyond the surface to understand the way Marilyn thinks and where she comes from.  Somewhat paradoxically, the result for me is that I stop thinking about whether Michelle Williams is like or unlike Marilyn.  I am instead totally invested in the Marilyn of MW's creation.  She responds instinctively and organically to the adulation of the crowd, to the blustering of Lawrence Olivier, to the besotted adoration of Colin Clark.  She is riveting to watch on her own merits and not because she is playing someone who was an attention magnet.The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent.  Even with relatively little to do, Judi Dench, Emma Watson and Julia Ormond distinguish themselves. Kenneth Branagh's Olivier is a little over the top but it works.The whole scenario for making the movie The Prince and the Showgirl is so intriguing.  Colin has a great line where he says that Marilyn is a movie star trying to become a serious actress, while Olivier is a serious actor trying to become a movie star.  That is really the turning point where Colin gains her confidence.This is also a movie about the culture shock of MM going to England with her entourage, but with no one who truly loves her.  Obviously in a week Marilyn and Colin did not develop a deep and lasting love, but they were there for each other to get through the tough time together.I don't think this is a great movie, but it is a very fine movie with a great performance by Michelle Williams.

1451087,A35VI0H5AFHOJ5,B0059XTUB8,Sharon Isch,"[1, 1]","It's 1956 and the most famous woman in the world, Marilyn Monroe, has just arrived in England to film ""The Prince and the Showgirl."" She'll be playing opposite Britain's greatest stage actor, Laurence Olivier, who'll also be directing.  It's an understatement to say the stars are not aligned.  Marilyn is a famous movie star who wants to be an Actress. Olivier is a famous actor who wants to be a Movie Star.  Egos and  insecurities clash. Tantrums ensue. Assorted dogsbodies make power plays.  Finally, Marilyn finds someone she can trust and be herself with:  Colin Clark, the 23-year-old 3rd assistant director, son of Sir Kenneth, and most junior member of the film crew, just out of university and in his first paying job.Many years later, after Marilyn has died, Clark will publish a memoir about their week together.  And many years after that,  when all the key characters, including Clark himself, have also departed this life, that memoir will be adapted into the movie we see here.  Michelle Williams  will get a well deserved nomination for the  2012 best actress Oscar (which she might  well have won had it not been for Streep's tour de force as Margaret Thatcher).  Kenneth Branagh as Olivier is his usual brilliant self. Judi Dench  shines in a small role as the wise old actress and intermediary Dame Sybil Thorndike.  Eddie Redmayne is wonderful  in the role of Colin.  I've not yet re-watched it with the director's commentary, but the making-of extra is well worth viewing. My only complaint is that the teeny-tiny-white-type-on-black-screen blurbs at the end, filling us in on  what happened next in the careers of  Marilyn, Olivier and Clark, are a real challenge to read on a TV screen.",4,"My 99 minutes with Marilyn, Olivier, Colin  & Company: Time well spent",1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,1710,"['1956', 'most', 'famous', 'woman', 'world', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'just', 'arrived', 'England', 'film', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', ""'ll"", 'be', 'playing', 'opposite', 'Britain', 'greatest', 'stage', 'actor', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'who', ""'ll"", 'also', 'be', 'directing', 'understatement', 'say', 'stars', 'are', 'not', 'aligned', 'Marilyn', 'famous', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'be', 'Actress', 'Olivier', 'famous', 'actor', 'who', 'be', 'Movie', 'Star', 'Egos', 'insecurities', 'clash', 'Tantrums', 'ensue', 'Assorted', 'dogsbodies', 'make', 'power', 'plays', 'Finally', 'Marilyn', 'someone', 'can', 'trust', 'be', 'herself', 'Colin', 'Clark', '23-year-old', '3rd', 'assistant', 'director', 'son', 'Sir', 'Kenneth', 'most', 'junior', 'member', 'film', 'crew', 'just', 'university', 'first', 'paying', 'job.Many', 'years', 'later', 'Marilyn', 'died', 'Clark', 'will', 'publish', 'memoir', 'week', 'together', 'many', 'years', 'when', 'key', 'characters', 'including', 'Clark', 'have', 'also', 'departed', 'life', 'memoir', 'will', 'be', 'adapted', 'movie', 'see', 'here', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'will', 'get', 'well', 'deserved', 'nomination', '2012', 'best', 'actress', 'Oscar', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'won', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'Streep', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Olivier', 'usual', 'brilliant', 'self', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'shines', 'small', 'role', 'wise', 'old', 'actress', 'intermediary', 'Dame', 'Sybil', 'Thorndike', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'wonderful', 'role', 'Colin', ""'ve"", 'not', 'yet', 're-watched', 'director', 'commentary', 'making-of', 'extra', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'only', 'complaint', 'teeny-tiny-white-type-on-black-screen', 'blurbs', 'end', 'filling', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'careers', 'Marilyn', 'Olivier', 'Clark', 'are', 'real', 'challenge', 'read', 'TV', 'screen']",My Week with Marilyn
1451088,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B0059XTUB8,Sheryl Fechter,"[9, 12]","While observing this solely on the movie's merit, not if it may or may not be factual being  based on the personal diaries of Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), I definitely enjoyed this story.  A glimpse into one week of the iconic status of Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) is a provocative notion.  I found Williams a quick study in the subtleties of her charge and extremely brave to step up to this kind of demand.  Williams fleshes out Monroe in a solemnization.  She neither fully inhabits nor imitates her as much as she celebrates the Marilyn Monroe everyone could appreciate.  I found her quite able to balance Monroe's obvious intelligence along with her shaky naivety at the same time.  Of course, Williams could never replicate Marilyn Monroe in a performance, the physicality of the two is widely different among other things, although I saw her bring the nuances and idiosyncrasies of Monroe's personality to life.  Her stage presence, sexuality, innocence and vulnerability are all well shown.Into London of 1955 comes the filming of the anticipated movie ""The Prince and the Showgirl"".  A young, and obviously obsessed with the film business, Colin Clark is able to get involved with the production, but more so with the object of his desire, Marilyn Monroe.  He offers her a certain freedom with his friendship during an immense time of fragility for her;  providing laughter, hushed conversations, free-spirited romps, and the ability to escape everything.  The film presented in this way shows the almost over-importance of Clark in the making of Olivier's movie concerning his handling of Marilyn Monroe alone.  But of course, this is all done from his point of view, his ideas and beliefs.While the acting is all amazing, a complete stand out for me was Kenneth Branagh as Sir Laurence Olivier.  He pulled perfection into his portrayal of the ego driven icon that he was himself.  His mannerisms, temperament, perfectionism, and vocal all screamed ""Olivier"".  The renowned stage actor coming into the making of this movie was a huge transition, especially with wanting to cast a 'movie star', Marilyn Monroe, alongside him.An understated Vivien Leigh - 'Lady Olivier' - (Julia Ormond), shows an ease in her position of his wife and a more vulnerable side with her adoration of her husband.  The wonderfully astute Dame Sybil Thorndike (Judi Dench) lends a firm hand and a necessary leading guidance within her performance.  In ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" she was the softest and caring anchor for Monroe's shaky resolve and awestruck times during the filming. This all happening as Olivier's control was escaping him.  She remained soothing and tried to keep a balance between the two actors and the two egos.""My Week With Marilyn"" is just that; according to Colin Clark.  His week, from his diaries,  and adapted from his book.  Done with this leaning it may be hard to swallow any of its validity without suspending your disbelief.  With taking this all in mind, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and have watched it several times.",5,"""All People Ever See Is Marilyn Monroe ...

1451090,A1W9JB3KRSDEQD,B0059XTUB8,"singer ""mg""","[2, 3]","I found this film very entertaining, enlightening but most of all endearing.  There isn't one actor who's performance doesn't add to the whole of this film, they all put on stellar performances without a hint of overstatement or artifice.The story of course is of a young english aristocrat who's love of cinema has him seek out a job in film.  Through his family connections he finally gets hired as 3rd assistant director in the film 'The Prince and the Showgirl' starring Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe.  The story thereafter is of a brief non-sexual encounter with Monroe and all that happened in the making of the film. Kenneth Branagh is superb channeling Sir Laurence Olivier, in a performance that had me laughing half the time and mesmerized about the small aspects of Olivier's style he managed to hone without it coming across as camp. Marilyn famously clashes with Olivier, who as director, has to put up with her tardiness, forgetting lines and general fragile yet diva behaviour.Now for Michelle Williams.  In the beginning of the film they show an excerpt of Williams performing Heat Wave from the film 'There's No Business Like Show business""  and I immediately had mixed feelings and almost thought she was miscast;  it was her body.  You see Williams diminutive child-like frame barely holding up a dress meant for a curvier woman. They pad her hips which contrasts two twigs meant to be legs, small arms and breasts, old hollywood make-up that left Williams looking old and washed out and not a hint of sexiness...I was aghast and thought ""This is wrong, ALL WRONG!!!"". They make up for this by later concentrating mostly on Williams face who is more than talented enough to exude the vulnerability, freshness, seductive sweetness and almost too open unguarded expressions we come to recognize as distinctly Monroe charm, also they leave off the heavy make-up.  This is a role where the physicality is important, we don't just remember Marilyn's face but the natural contours of her body, so to have an actress with the wrong body distracts the same way a too skinny woman playing Sophia Loren would have you questioning the authenticity of the role. The camera however compensates and concentrates on what Williams gets right which is the mood and cheekiness of Marilyn, the vanilla ice cream sexiness and little girl lost.  Its a distilled Marilyn that left me thinking ""Nicely Done!"".  Williams brings a dignity, humanity and authentic classy sweetness to the role. I'm sure Marilyn would have been proud.There is no question that the portrayal of what went on at the shooting of The Prince and the Showgirl is accurate.  If you have read enough biographies on Marilyn at that time everything in this film just fits including the nature of he behaviour which today is attributed to Borderline Personality Disorder.  They show MM as manipulative but in the way toddlers are, grabbing hold demanding time, attention and affection when they need you and then forgetting you minutes later only to return and drain you a bit more, the difference is we don't take it personally when it comes from a toddler.  Marilyn was very emotionally demanding and consequently seduced a lot of minders and helpers and people who thought only they could protect her, understand her, help her when in the end they were simply dangling from her strings. It is said that during the filming 'The Misfits' Marilyn broke Arthur Miller who was doing everything and anything to make her happy; at the end of shooting she had arranged a ride from location with other people and got in a car which drove away leaving Miller deserted, abandoned, alone and without a ride on a deserted set.  It was as if he were merely an old shoe she had forgotten to pack.  Consequently they divorced but he like Di Maggio loved her dearly and both went to their grave never writing or speaking of Marilyn out of complete respect for her.  If only Princess Diana could have said the same.",4,Very pleasing,1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,3970,"['found', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'enlightening', 'most', 'endearing', ""n't"", 'one', 'actor', 'who', 'performance', ""n't"", 'add', 'whole', 'film', 'put', 'stellar', 'performances', 'hint', 'overstatement', 'artifice.The', 'story', 'course', 'young', 'english', 'aristocrat', 'who', 'love', 'cinema', 'seek', 'out', 'job', 'film', 'family', 'connections', 'finally', 'hired', '3rd', 'assistant', 'director', 'film', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'starring', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'story', 'thereafter', 'brief', 'non-sexual', 'encounter', 'Monroe', 'happened', 'making', 'film', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'superb', 'channeling', 'Sir', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'performance', 'had', 'laughing', 'time', 'mesmerized', 'small', 'aspects', 'Olivier', 'style', 'managed', 'hone', 'coming', 'camp', 'Marilyn', 'famously', 'Olivier', 'who', 'director', 'put', 'up', 'tardiness', 'forgetting', 'lines', 'general', 'fragile', 'yet', 'diva', 'behaviour.Now', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'beginning', 'film', 'show', 'excerpt', 'Williams', 'performing', 'Heat', 'Wave', 'film', 'Business', 'Show', 'business', 'immediately', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'almost', 'thought', 'was', 'miscast', 'was', 'body', 'see', 'Williams', 'diminutive', 'child-like', 'frame', 'barely', 'holding', 'up', 'dress', 'meant', 'curvier', 'woman', 'pad', 'hips', 'two', 'twigs', 'meant', 'be', 'legs', 'small', 'arms', 'breasts', 'old', 'hollywood', 'make-up', 'left', 'Williams', 'looking', 'old', 'washed', 'out', 'not', 'hint', 'sexiness', 'was', 'aghast', 'thought', 'wrong', 'ALL', 'WRONG', 'make', 'up', 'later', 'concentrating', 'mostly', 'Williams', 'face', 'who', 'more', 'talented', 'enough', 'exude', 'vulnerability', 'freshness', 'seductive', 'sweetness', 'almost', 'too', 'open', 'unguarded', 'expressions', 'come', 'recognize', 'distinctly', 'Monroe', 'charm', 'also', 'leave', 'off', 'heavy', 'make-up', 'role', 'where', 'physicality', 'important', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'remember', 'Marilyn', 'face', 'natural', 'contours', 'body', 'so', 'have', 'actress', 'wrong', 'body', 'same', 'way', 'too', 'skinny', 'woman', 'playing', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'would', 'have', 'questioning', 'authenticity', 'role', 'camera', 'however', 'compensates', 'concentrates', 'what', 'Williams', 'right', 'mood', 'cheekiness', 'Marilyn', 'vanilla', 'ice', 'cream', 'sexiness', 'little', 'girl', 'lost', 'distilled', 'Marilyn', 'left', 'thinking', 'Nicely', 'Done', 'Williams', 'dignity', 'humanity', 'authentic', 'classy', 'sweetness', 'role', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Marilyn', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'question', 'portrayal', 'what', 'went', 'shooting', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'accurate', 'have', 'read', 'enough', 'biographies', 'Marilyn', 'time', 'everything', 'film', 'just', 'including', 'nature', 'behaviour', 'today', 'attributed', 'Borderline', 'Personality', 'Disorder', 'show', 'MM', 'manipulative', 'way', 'toddlers', 'are', 'grabbing', 'hold', 'demanding', 'time', 'attention', 'affection', 'when', 'need', 'then', 'forgetting', 'minutes', 'later', 'only', 'return', 'drain', 'bit', 'more', 'difference', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'personally', 'when', 'toddler', 'Marilyn', 'was', 'very', 'emotionally', 'demanding', 'consequently', 'seduced', 'lot', 'minders', 'helpers', 'people', 'who', 'thought', 'only', 'could', 'protect', 'understand', 'help', 'when', 'end', 'were', 'simply', 'dangling', 'strings', 'said', 'filming', ""'The"", 'Misfits', 'Marilyn', 'broke', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'who', 'was', 'doing', 'everything', 'anything', 'make', 'happy', 'end', 'shooting', 'had', 'arranged', 'ride', 'location', 'other', 'people', 'got', 'car', 'drove', 'away', 'leaving', 'Miller', 'deserted', 'abandoned', 'alone', 'ride', 'deserted', 'set', 'was', 'were', 'merely', 'old', 'shoe', 'had', 'forgotten', 'pack', 'Consequently', 'divorced', 'Di', 'Maggio', 'loved', 'dearly', 'went', 'grave', 'never', 'writing', 'speaking', 'Marilyn', 'complete', 'respect', 'only', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'could', 'have', 'said', 'same']",My Week with Marilyn

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[9, 12]","I'm old enough to remember seeing most of Marilyn Monroe's films on the big screen when they were released. And I'm sure I had her pinup somewhere in my room. I'm sorry she never finished her last film ""Something's Gotta Give"" but, as I was watching Michelle Williams in the new film, I felt I was seeing a ""New"" Marilyn film. Williams was perfect casting. And I had never seen her before. I missed ""Blue Valentine"". She really channels Monroe and is both sexy and introspective.As you have probably read - I won't go over the plot again, as others have surely done that here - the film is based on Colin Clark's journal about the week he spent on the set of the film that eventually became ""The Prince and The Showgirl"". I can't think of a male over age 18 that won't think - while watching this film - ""Wow! If only I was in Clark's position!"" And I'm sure many will dream of that! Honestly, I  can't say how this plays out from the point of the female viewer.No this is not an ""epic"" film but rather the kind of small ""Quality"" films that the Weinstein Company finds and releases. (Just look at ""The Artist"", ""The Descendants"" and ""The Iron Lady""; all with superb casting and lots of Oscar noms.). And for that I can recommend it highly. It's not long - at just 99 minutes.Both the DVD and the Blu-ray have the same bonus features. These include a full length commentary by Director Simon Curtis as well as a 19-minute "" The Untold Story of An American Icon"", which is the now-typical ""making of"" featurette which mixes comments from the cast and production crew with scenes from the film. There a few actually newsreels clips of Monroe included, but not enough to mention. And there is nothing included putting this ""week of filming in England"" into perspective with the rest of Monroe's career or the culture of the times. A short documentary on Monroe would have added greatly to the experience for viewers who were not alive during Monroe's life.My five-stars are based on the film itself, as I want to encourage others to see it.

That's how thoroughly Michelle Williams inhabited the character. I haven't see Meryl Streep's movie yet (I am not that enamored with Margaret Thatcher) so I can't make a comparision. I can say Michelle nailed this role. Kenneth Branaugh played Laurence Olivier with aplomb and a twinkle in his eye.

The cast is full of very famous people and relies on the viewer's ability to believe that the people on the screen are who they say they are. You can't just say, ""Hey, Marilyn"" or ""Hey, Vivienne"" and expect us to go along. They are too well known. I found myself having to work too hard to keep track of the story because what was on the screen was too inexplicable. Vivienne Leigh and Olivier were supposed to have wild chemistry. This pair had none.I have seen Monroe portrayed as a sex fiend, a drug addict/drunk, a lunatic, and a vulnerable girl. This movie attempts to show a bit of all of those sides to Monroe and fails. There are moments when Williams seems credible -like during her interactions with Arthur Miller. She comes across as needy and vulnerable, but what made Marilyn Marilyn was her sex appeal and incredible stage presence. I think that part was just wrong, wrong, wrong. As a performing artist, I just don't believe that can be faked. You can't watch someone turn it on and then emulate it. That is something that comes from within. If it were that easy, there would have been a million copy cats.

Unfortunately, Michelle Wililams is no Marilyn Monroe, at all. She does not have the face, body or voice. She is cute. Not beautiful. She just didn't have it. It was almost painful to watch. And there was something weird she did with her eyes, when she was listening to Colin talk - as if she was thinking and having some revelation inside her head - possible, but didn't come across as good acting. Just strange.I also didn't believe that Monroe would become dependent on Colin Clark and they would have this wonderful day together, skinny-dipping and visiting Windsor Castle and all. When did she stop to take her pills?Everyone around her told Colin to leave her alone or he would get hurt. He was warned that he would be used. Of course he did not care, what young man would? But I don't think this relationship happened, except in his fantasies.Olivier seemed most on target that he could see through Monroe. She knew exactly what she was doing, being late, manipulating people, pretending to be helpless and stupid and not know her lines. And that she did not need rescuing. He was right about all that. But there was something strange about Kenneth Branagh playing Laurence Olivier. He wasn't right for the part either. I think his acting and speech were good, but physically, there was something disturbing. He didn't look like him, but it wasn't just that - his cheeks were too fat, his hair too slick?

1451102,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B0059XTUB8,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[5, 7]","I remember when I was in Hollywood a few years ago and was on the Walk of Fame.  Out of all of the stars, the one that I saw the most people taking pictures of and literally laying next to on the (dirty) street was Marilyn Monroe.  It was actually quite astonishing that after all of these years Marilyn Monroe still captures the psyche of people.  She is the quintessential icon of classic Hollywood and the epitome of a timeless sex symbol.  At times I feel that the idea and persona of Marilyn Monroe is actually more alluring than her movies.When I watched ""My Week with Marilyn"" I wasn't sure what to expect.  I knew it was critically acclaimed and Michelle Williams was nominated for an Academy Award.  However, in this day and age (at least to me) accolades and praise from the critics do not really hold a lot of water.I have to say that this movie is really a breathe of fresh air.  It is different from a lot of the same cookie cutter movies coming out today.  The film is based on the memoir(s) by Colin Clark about his personal experience with Marilyn Monroe while she filmed ""The Prince & the Showgirl"" in London.  During the production of this film Clark and Monroe developed a kinship and a semi-romantic relationship...at least according to Clark's accounts.  In addition, the movie also displays the production and grapples of filming ""The Prince & the Showgirl"" and at about 98 minutes not a moment is wasted.I found the acting in this movie to be superb.  Michelle Williams really did an amazing job in her portrayal of Monroe; right down to mannerisms, delivery of dialogue and appearance.  I must be honest; there were some scenes where Michelle Williams was a dead ringer (the cover of the DVD for instance) for Marilyn Monroe and other scenes where she looked nothing like her.  I realize this might be nitpicking, but I feel it should be noted.  Regardless, this takes nothing away from Williams' performance.  Actually, I have more respect for her as an actress after this movie; she even sang all of the songs. Kenneth Branagh was amazing (as always) as Laurence Olivier and Eddie Redmayne as Colin Clark was also wonderful.  I have a hard time believing this is the same Redmayne from the film ""Black Death""!  Also look for good supporting roles from Judi Dench, Julia Ormond and Emma Watson.There have been so many ""stories"" about Marilyn Monroe that don't paint her in a positive light, this movie manages to show a very multi-leveled depiction of her.  The movie itself plays out like a comedy-drama and is able to be both innocent and melancholy.  The film does a wonderful job of detaining 1956 and showing an era that is long gone.  The score is also beautiful and haunting.I have heard some people condemned Clark's accounts with Monroe finding it dubious, stating that it was fabricated and fluffed up.  I don't know if that is true or not, I wasn't there.  Regardless truth or embellished, it is a great story and for that fact a wonderful movie.  I can definitely see myself revisiting this motion picture in the future.  I recommend this movie to anyone who truly enjoys the ""art of cinema"".",5,My viewing with Marilyn,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,3129,"['remember', 'when', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'Walk', 'Fame', 'stars', 'one', 'saw', 'most', 'people', 'taking', 'pictures', 'literally', 'laying', 'next', 'dirty', 'street', 'was', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'astonishing', 'years', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'still', 'psyche', 'people', 'quintessential', 'icon', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'epitome', 'timeless', 'sex', 'symbol', 'times', 'feel', 'idea', 'persona', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'actually', 'more', 'alluring', 'movies.When', 'watched', 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'knew', 'was', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'However', 'day', 'age', 'least', 'accolades', 'praise', 'critics', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'hold', 'lot', 'water.I', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'really', 'breathe', 'fresh', 'air', 'different', 'lot', 'same', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'movies', 'coming', 'out', 'today', 'film', 'based', 'memoir', 's', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'personal', 'experience', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'filmed', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'London', 'production', 'film', 'Clark', 'Monroe', 'developed', 'kinship', 'semi-romantic', 'relationship', 'least', 'according', 'Clark', 'accounts', 'addition', 'movie', 'also', 'production', 'grapples', 'filming', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'about', '98', 'minutes', 'not', 'moment', 'wasted.I', 'acting', 'movie', 'be', 'superb', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'really', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'portrayal', 'Monroe', 'right', 'mannerisms', 'delivery', 'dialogue', 'appearance', 'must', 'be', 'honest', 'were', 'scenes', 'where', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'was', 'dead', 'ringer', 'cover', 'DVD', 'instance', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'other', 'scenes', 'where', 'looked', 'nothing', 'realize', 'might', 'be', 'nitpicking', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Regardless', 'nothing', 'away', 'Williams', 'performance', 'Actually', 'have', 'more', 'respect', 'actress', 'movie', 'even', 'sang', 'songs', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'was', 'amazing', 'always', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'was', 'also', 'wonderful', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'same', 'Redmayne', 'film', 'Black', 'Death', 'Also', 'look', 'good', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'Emma', 'Watson.There', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'stories', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'do', ""n't"", 'paint', 'positive', 'light', 'movie', 'show', 'very', 'multi-leveled', 'depiction', 'movie', 'out', 'comedy-drama', 'able', 'be', 'innocent', 'melancholy', 'film', 'wonderful', 'job', 'detaining', '1956', 'showing', 'era', 'long', 'gone', 'score', 'also', 'beautiful', 'haunting.I', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'condemned', 'Clark', 'accounts', 'Monroe', 'finding', 'dubious', 'stating', 'was', 'fabricated', 'fluffed', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'true', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'Regardless', 'truth', 'embellished', 'great', 'story', 'fact', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'revisiting', 'motion', 'picture', 'future', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'truly', 'art', 'cinema']",My Week with Marilyn

If we are to believe this biographical piece about Marilyn Monroe's stay in England while filming The Prince and the Showgirl with Lawrence Olivier she was a miserable person who was insecure, manipulative, and proped up solely by drugs and alcohol.  Michelle Williams gives a convincing performance of the air-headed Monroe, and Kenneth Branagh does a good job channeling Lawrence Olivier with his dark brooding, quoting Shakespear,  and festering mid-life crisis.  The movie tells the story of Colin Clark who was desperately trying to break into the film industry in spite of his upper class families' chargrin.  Marilyn sees him as an innocent young pup that she can rely on to try to burry her sorrows and chastly worship her without trying to take advantage of her sexually.  Olivier and the people surrounding Monroe making the movie are green with envy and as Marilyn (her husband Arthur Miller fleeing back to the USA unable to stand the men buzzing around his wife like honey bees and her incessant collapses from drug and alcohol use)calls upon Colin again and again to escape the misery of her existence.Although a little before my time, I think the movie did a good job in portraying the 1950s.  I liked the film, felt the performances good, the only reason I'm giving the movie 4 stars instead of 5 is that I can't believe that Monroe was as stupid as she was depicted in the film.  I suspect that she was actually more calculating than portrayed here and that her passive aggressive behaviors that were only marginally hinted at in the movie, were actually probably much more pronounced in real life.

Olivier becomes increasingly frustrated with Monroe's unprofessional behavior; she's regularly late for shootings and often is unable to remember her lines. In the midst of this tense situation the emotionally fractured Monroe turns to young Clark as an improbable ally, confidante, and lover.Michelle Williams' Oscar-nominated performance is breathtaking. She simply NAILS the part of the desperately troubled Monroe. Kenneth Branagh gives a very commendable turn as Olivier and Redmayne does fine duty as the young man in way over his head. Julia Ormond is exquisite as Olivier's wife, actress Vivien Leigh, and Dench, Watson, and Wanamaker are wonderful in their small roles. It's a great cast and a delightful and bittersweet story.Four stars for the film but five stars for Michelle Williams.Postscript: I got quite a chuckle out of several reviewers who bashed Michelle Williams' Oscar-nominated performance, which just confirms that many people have no clue.",4,Troubled icon leans on starry eyed kid,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,1709,"['Week', 'Marilyn', '2011', 'was', 'directed', 'Simon', 'Curtis', 'stars', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Zoe', 'Wanamaker.Colin', 'Clark', 'Redmayne', '23', 'year-old', 'aristocratic', 'family', 'renowned', 'art', 'historian', 'Sir', 'Kenneth', 'Clark', 'father', 'who', 'signs', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'production', 'company', 'gopher', 'prior', 'shooting', '1957', 'film', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'Olivier', 'Branagh', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Williams', 'leads', 'unlikely', 'pairing', 'Olivier', 'widely', 'acknowledged', 'finest', 'classically', 'trained', 'actor', 'time', 'Monroe', 'achieved', 'international', 'icon', 'status', 'playing', 'ditzy', 'sex', 'kittens', 'now', 'be', 'serious', 'Method', 'actress', 'Olivier', 'increasingly', 'frustrated', 'Monroe', 'unprofessional', 'behavior', 'regularly', 'late', 'shootings', 'often', 'unable', 'remember', 'lines', 'midst', 'tense', 'situation', 'emotionally', 'fractured', 'Monroe', 'young', 'Clark', 'improbable', 'ally', 'confidante', 'lover.Michelle', 'Williams', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'breathtaking', 'simply', 'NAILS', 'part', 'desperately', 'troubled', 'Monroe', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'very', 'commendable', 'turn', 'Olivier', 'Redmayne', 'fine', 'duty', 'young', 'man', 'way', 'head', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'exquisite', 'Olivier', 'wife', 'actress', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'Dench', 'Watson', 'Wanamaker', 'are', 'wonderful', 'small', 'roles', 'great', 'cast', 'delightful', 'bittersweet', 'story.Four', 'stars', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'Michelle', 'Williams.Postscript', 'got', 'quite', 'chuckle', 'several', 'reviewers', 'who', 'bashed', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'just', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'clue']",My Week with Marilyn

The film is directed by Simon Curtis, director of critically acclaimed the 1999 version of ""David Copperfield"" (starring young Daniel Radcliffe), and ""Cranford"" (with Steve Hudson).""My Week with Marilyn"" succeeds more as an ode to the lost days of filmmaking than as a love romance or a coming-of-age story. With their different acting styles - Monroe constantly asking advice from Paula Strasberg (Zo Wanamaker), Lee Strasberg's wife, and Olivier, who obviously hates Strasberg's method acting - filming at Pinewood Studio turns out a nightmare. Williams and Branagh (very funny) effectively capture the insecurity and frustration of the stars, both of whom know something is terribly wrong, but fail to understand what it is.After her husband Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) goes back to America, Marilyn Monroe begins to find solace in spending time with Colin Clark, who has been dating a wardrobe assistant Lucy (Emma Watson). Though Michelle Williams is terrific as a charming and fragile star, characters of Eddie Redmayne's Colin and Emma Watson's Lucy seem underdeveloped.

1451112,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0059XTUB8,Turfseer,"[4, 7]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3.5Colin Clark was only 24 years old when he served as '3rd Assistant Director' on the 1957 film 'The Prince and The Showgirl' starring Marilyn Monroe and Lawrence Olivier. Clark kept a diary while on the set and later published it, along with a memoir of his purported experiences with Monroe. It's notable that Clark didn't seem overly impressed with the Hollywood icon, when he wrote in his diary, but when the memoir came out, his view of her apparently had changed to much more 'favorable'.For those unfamiliar with 'My Week with Marilyn', it provides a glimpse at Marilyn Monroe at the height of her popularity, a few months after she married famed playwright, Arthur Miller, in 1956. This was a chance for Marilyn to show her chops, pitted against stage legend Olivier, who in turn was given the reins to direct, 'The Prince and the Showgirl', a light weight comedy with the ""most popular woman in the world"", in the starring role. Dougray Scott is a dead ringer for Miller but his character is only on screen very briefly, as Miller decided to go back home right before the shoot, as he was having trouble putting up with all of Marilyn's mood changes. Judi Dench is also too briefly seen as Dame Sybil Thorndike, who plays an older aristocratic woman in the film within a film.Michelle Williams does a very nice job conveying the many moods of the starlet. When Monroe first came to the set of 'The Prince and the Showgirl', she was intimidated by Olivier, who was not impressed with her coach, Paula Strausberg, an advocate of Method Acting. While Kenneth Branagh doesn't look at all like Olivier, he ably conveys his contempt for both Marilyn's lack of professionalism and 'The Method' itself, as he was convinced that actors could never be spontaneous when utilizing such a technique. Olivier is seen warning Clark that he should not be fooled by Monroe's ""little girl lost"" routine. Not only was Monroe habitually late on the set but we learn of a more deep-seated insecurity, which she attempted to mask by imbibing huge amounts of prescription medication.Williams also does well in conveying Marilyn Monroe's charm. Most of the film's narrative is about how Colin Clark acts as her buffer, 'protecting' her against the various people she felt assailed by, including her business partner, Milton Greene, who attempted to bar Clark from spending time with her, during the production. Clark appears to fall completely for Monroe especially after she continuously flirts with him. In one scene, Monroe encourages Clark to join him skinny-dipping in a lake, off the beaten path, in the English countryside; later, she invites him into her bed for some heavy duty cuddling.While entertaining, the film suffers from the limits of its venue. We pretty much realize that the stakes aren't that high here to begin with--a young man takes a soft fall, after he realizes that his infatuation was just that--an infatuation! The 'dark moment' of the second Act arrives when Marilyn has her big meltdown, which threatens to shut down the entire production. All's well that ends when, when Marilyn wakes up and wants to go home for her mother-in-law's chicken soup, back in Brooklyn.Eddie Redmayne may be a tad too old to play Colin Clark, but is still fine as the impressionable gopher. Emma Watson is seen for a short time in a throwaway part as Colin's love interest, perhaps the least interesting role in the entire film. There are other players in short bits here, that add to the film's overall verisimilitude.Perhaps the most telling scene in the film is when Clark asks Marilyn to give up her career and run away with him. She graciously declines by replying that she enjoys her life. If that's the case, why does she spend so much time popping pills and generally being so down on herself? Olivier sees her as a lot shrewder than many of her handlers and sycophants, who appear to indulge and enable her. This is perhaps one aspect of Marilyn's character, the shrewd businesswoman, that is not explored very fully in this film--however, since we're only getting a glimpse of what she was like during a limited time period, such an exploration may be a bit beyond the scope of this overall project.'My Week with Marilyn' sometimes borders on hagiography. Whatever talent Marilyn Monroe did have, it seems that the many men who 'fell in love' with her, fell more for an image than a real person. I wonder if she could have done as well in the acting department, if she wasn't completely addicted to all her pills. Nonetheless, here, Michelle Williams does a fine job in serving up enough aspects of Marilyn Monroe's character to keep us interested until the end. Sadly Colin Clark is no longer with us, but while he was alive, he must have looked back on those heady days of his youth, as perhaps the greatest experience of his life. 'My Week With Marilyn' allows us to take that journey too, and a good part of it rings true.",3,"Nuanced channeling of screen legend works well with breezy, coming of age backdrop",1328745600,"02 9,

1451113,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0059XTUB8,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","When Colin Clark, the wealthy son of a nobleman, was twenty-three, he worked as a third assistant director for Sir Laurence Olivier on the set of THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL. The movie co-starred Olivier as the Prince and Marilyn Monroe as the Showgirl. Olivier hired Monroe as his co-star because he was intending the movie to be the film that would ignite his career with American audiences. Monroe was hoping the experience of working with the illustrious Olivier in an English production would help her land more serious roles and be the stepping stone to becoming a seriously regarded actress. However, neither the experience nor the film itself turned out the way either had hoped. During the filming of THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL, Clark spent a week closely working with Monroe, becoming her escort and confidant.  MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is based off Clark's books (he wrote two different books about the experience).The film begins with Clark (Eddie Redmayne) determined to get a job at Laurence Olivier's (Kenneth Branagh) film studio. He's eventually hired and goes to work as Olivier's third assistant director on the set of his newest production, THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL. Shortly after Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) arrives in England with all her entourage, including drama coach Paula Strausberg (Zoe Wanamaker) and new husband Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott). There's lots of photo ops with Monroe and Olivier as the press eats up the meeting of American film royalty and British theatre royalty. The honeymoon is extremely short-lived and problems begin almost the instant filming begins as Monroe never on time and doesn't seem to understand the simplest direction. Olivier becomes outraged and the production becomes prolonged. During this time, Clark becomes acquainted with Monroe and she ends up choosing Clark to be her ""friend"" during this difficult period for her.The acting in MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is superb. Williams delivers a stellar performance and is uncanny in her portrayal of Monroe. Likewise, Branagh's performance as Olivier is dead-on, too. I had never heard of Colin Clark before, but Redmayne gives a solid performance, too. Dame Judi Dench gives a wonderful performance as Dame Sybil Thorndike and Emma Watson, in her first post-Harry Potter role, is a delight on the screen as Lucy, the pre-Marilyn love interest of Clark.I enjoyed MY WEEK WITH MARILYN, but I was somewhat disappointed by it, too. The movie features some fantastic acting and the story involves some fascinating, real-life characters. However, this movie isn't about Marilyn Monroe or Laurence Olivier. It's about Colin Clark. The film is told from his point of view. Therefore, though Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier are featured, they aren't really what the story is about. The story is about this fascinating time in Clark's life and his thoughts and experiences while working on THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL. This one experience provides a lifetime of memories for him, but it's still just a week in his life and at the end of the movie he's not much different than he was at the start; he has a movie production under his belt, but he's still the son of a nobleman.MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is a movie worth watching if you enjoy great acting, are a fan of any of the actors involved in the production, or if you have an interest in any of the real-life people the movie is about. The pacing of the movie is a bit uneven and the focus of the story is Clark and not Monroe or Olivier. With that said, it's still rather interesting to see how this one particular person spent his week with Marilyn Monroe.",4,Superb Acting Lost in a Weak Story,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,3619,"['When', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'wealthy', 'son', 'nobleman', 'was', 'twenty-three', 'worked', 'third', 'assistant', 'director', 'Sir', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'set', 'THE', 'PRINCE', 'AND', 'THE', 'SHOWGIRL', 'movie', 'co-starred', 'Olivier', 'Prince', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Showgirl', 'Olivier', 'hired', 'Monroe', 'co-star', 'was', 'intending', 'movie', 'be', 'film', 'would', 'ignite', 'career', 'American', 'audiences', 'Monroe', 'was', 'hoping', 'experience', 'working', 'illustrious', 'Olivier', 'English', 'production', 'would', 'help', 'land', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'be', 'stepping', 'stone', 'becoming', 'seriously', 'regarded', 'actress', 'However', 'experience', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'had', 'hoped', 'filming', 'THE', 'PRINCE', 'AND', 'THE', 'SHOWGIRL', 'Clark', 'spent', 'week', 'closely', 'working', 'Monroe', 'becoming', 'escort', 'confidant', 'MY', 'WEEK', 'WITH', 'MARILYN', 'based', 'off', 'Clark', 'books', 'wrote', 'two', 'different', 'books', 'experience', '.The', 'film', 'Clark', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'determined', 'get', 'job', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'film', 'studio', 'eventually', 'hired', 'work', 'Olivier', 'third', 'assistant', 'director', 'set', 'newest', 'production', 'PRINCE', 'THE', 'SHOWGIRL', 'Shortly', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'England', 'entourage', 'including', 'drama', 'coach', 'Paula', 'Strausberg', 'Zoe', 'Wanamaker', 'new', 'husband', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'lots', 'photo', 'ops', 'Monroe', 'Olivier', 'press', 'up', 'meeting', 'American', 'film', 'royalty', 'British', 'theatre', 'royalty', 'honeymoon', 'extremely', 'short-lived', 'problems', 'begin', 'almost', 'instant', 'filming', 'Monroe', 'never', 'time', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'simplest', 'direction', 'Olivier', 'outraged', 'production', 'prolonged', 'time', 'Clark', 'acquainted', 'Monroe', 'up', 'choosing', 'Clark', 'be', 'friend', 'difficult', 'period', 'her.The', 'acting', 'MY', 'WEEK', 'WITH', 'MARILYN', 'superb', 'Williams', 'stellar', 'performance', 'uncanny', 'portrayal', 'Monroe', 'Likewise', 'Branagh', 'performance', 'Olivier', 'dead-on', 'too', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'Redmayne', 'solid', 'performance', 'too', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Dame', 'Sybil', 'Thorndike', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'first', 'post-Harry', 'Potter', 'role', 'delight', 'screen', 'Lucy', 'pre-Marilyn', 'love', 'interest', 'Clark.I', 'enjoyed', 'MY', 'WEEK', 'WITH', 'MARILYN', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'too', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'story', 'fascinating', 'real-life', 'characters', 'However', 'movie', ""n't"", 'about', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'film', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'Therefore', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'are', 'featured', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'what', 'story', 'about', 'story', 'fascinating', 'time', 'Clark', 'life', 'thoughts', 'experiences', 'working', 'THE', 'PRINCE', 'AND', 'THE', 'SHOWGIRL', 'one', 'experience', 'lifetime', 'memories', 'still', 'just', 'week', 'life', 'end', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'was', 'start', 'movie', 'production', 'belt', 'still', 'son', 'nobleman.MY', 'WEEK', 'WITH', 'MARILYN', 'movie', 'watching', 'enjoy', 'great', 'acting', 'are', 'fan', 'actors', 'involved', 'production', 'have', 'interest', 'real-life', 'people', 'movie', 'about', 'pacing', 'movie', 'bit', 'uneven', 'focus', 'story', 'Clark', 'not', 'Monroe', 'Olivier', 'said', 'still', 'rather', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'one', 'particular', 'person', 'spent', 'week', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe']",My Week with Marilyn
1451114,AMB2Z4FMDBWQY,B0059XTUB8,"VIDFAN ""specfellow""","[1, 5]","Recently, Hollywood has been filming memoirs by nobodies who, either due to dumb luck or nepotism, happen to run into legendary stars. A few years ago, ""Me and Orson Welles"" featured a young upstart played by Zac Efron who got to wear vintage clothing and observe the legendary director in action (i.e. being promiscuous and brillantly scamming his colleagues) and now we have ""My Week with Marilyn"" with Eddie Redmayne as the Third Assistant Director who watches in awe as two legends of the stage and screen wrestle with their insecurities during the filming of a trifling comedy, ""The Prince and The Showgirl"" (1957). Like ""Singing in the Rain"" and other ""behind the scenes"" metafictional Hollywood movies, all the real drama takes place off-stage more than on-stage. Of the two, I much prefer the latter, mainly because of Michelle Williams.At first, the sight of the fairly skinny Williams as Monroe didn't convince me. She has the requisite baby face but lacks the voluptuousness that everyone associates with Monroe. Also, she is just not in the same beauty league as the blonde bombshell - there is a plainness to her face. Strangely enough, she became magical the minute she started showing the dark underside to Marilyn's glamour. I totally fell in love with her the minute she and Kenneth Branagh (as Sir Laurence Olivier) started fighting. Here, Williams totally transformed herself into Marilyn in terms of portraying her shyness, little-girl-lostness and fears. I was amazed at how cleverly she evoked the spirit of the powerhouse blonde with the mountain of anxieties, mental issues, fear and low self-esteem that would ultimately doom her. The scenes of her struggling to remember her lines are painful and yet fascinating to watch.Like Williams, Branagh does a spot-on impersonation of Olivier by infusing himself with the spirit of the great actor rather than trying to emulate the purely physical shell of the man. His gestures and mannerisms made me laugh because they reminded me so well of Olivier's hamminess in some of his late '50s-'60s movies. The only actor I felt some injustice was done to was Vivien Leigh. The actress who portrays the once-gorgeous heroine of ""Gone with the Wind"" looks a little too old to play her. At 43, the real Viv was still a stunner, as photos taken during that time attest.The film is entertaining but unsatisifying. It shows nothing new about Marilyn and for people familiar with her life, it just confirms what we always knew - she was depressed, dysfunctional and yet gorgeous to the end. Despite the tragedy of Monroe's life, the film is as light as a souffle and is mostly humorous despite the dark undertone of Marilyn falling apart. This is because Colin Clark's limited perspective keeps us safely at a distance. Perhaps that is the appeal of these ""everyman (or everywoman) gets to meet a famous person"" movies - we all wish we were Colin Clark, living in glamorous times, getting a rare opportunity to see a legend close-up while being able to go home at the end of the day. We want to worship old dead movie stars and feel empathy for all their frailities without having to be caught up in the real-life messiness of their lives.In fact, Marilyn reminds me of the archetypal troubled co-worker who makes life hell for everyone in the office but for whom you retain a certain pity. The lack of a truly tragic tone is noteworthy given she would be dead only 5 years after making this film with Olivier.Overall, the film was enjoyable but shallow. It's not much more substantial than the film ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" though with more real-life angst.",3,Talented Cast Headed By Williams Makes You Believe She's Marilyn,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3620,"['Recently', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'filming', 'memoirs', 'nobodies', 'who', 'either', 'due', 'dumb', 'luck', 'nepotism', 'happen', 'run', 'legendary', 'stars', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Me', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'featured', 'young', 'upstart', 'played', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'who', 'got', 'wear', 'vintage', 'clothing', 'observe', 'legendary', 'director', 'action', 'i.e', 'being', 'promiscuous', 'brillantly', 'scamming', 'colleagues', 'now', 'have', 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'Third', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'who', 'awe', 'two', 'legends', 'stage', 'screen', 'wrestle', 'insecurities', 'filming', 'trifling', 'comedy', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', '1957', 'Singing', 'Rain', 'other', 'scenes', 'metafictional', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'real', 'drama', 'place', 'off-stage', 'more', 'on-stage', 'two', 'much', 'prefer', 'latter', 'mainly', 'Michelle', 'Williams.At', 'first', 'sight', 'fairly', 'skinny', 'Williams', 'Monroe', 'did', ""n't"", 'convince', 'requisite', 'baby', 'face', 'voluptuousness', 'everyone', 'Monroe', 'Also', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'beauty', 'league', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'plainness', 'face', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'became', 'magical', 'minute', 'started', 'showing', 'dark', 'underside', 'Marilyn', 'glamour', 'totally', 'fell', 'love', 'minute', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Sir', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'started', 'fighting', 'Here', 'Williams', 'totally', 'transformed', 'Marilyn', 'terms', 'portraying', 'shyness', 'little-girl-lostness', 'fears', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'cleverly', 'evoked', 'spirit', 'powerhouse', 'blonde', 'mountain', 'anxieties', 'mental', 'issues', 'fear', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'would', 'ultimately', 'doom', 'scenes', 'struggling', 'remember', 'lines', 'are', 'painful', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'watch.Like', 'Williams', 'Branagh', 'spot-on', 'impersonation', 'Olivier', 'infusing', 'spirit', 'great', 'actor', 'rather', 'trying', 'emulate', 'purely', 'physical', 'shell', 'man', 'gestures', 'mannerisms', 'made', 'reminded', 'so', 'well', 'Olivier', 'hamminess', 'late', ""'50s-'60s"", 'movies', 'only', 'actor', 'felt', 'injustice', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'actress', 'who', 'once-gorgeous', 'heroine', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'little', 'too', 'old', 'play', '43', 'real', 'Viv', 'was', 'still', 'stunner', 'photos', 'taken', 'time', 'attest.The', 'film', 'entertaining', 'unsatisifying', 'nothing', 'new', 'Marilyn', 'people', 'familiar', 'life', 'just', 'what', 'always', 'knew', 'was', 'depressed', 'dysfunctional', 'yet', 'gorgeous', 'end', 'tragedy', 'Monroe', 'life', 'film', 'as', 'light', 'souffle', 'mostly', 'humorous', 'dark', 'undertone', 'Marilyn', 'falling', 'apart', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'limited', 'perspective', 'keeps', 'safely', 'distance', 'Perhaps', 'appeal', 'everyman', 'everywoman', 'meet', 'famous', 'person', 'movies', 'wish', 'were', 'Colin', 'Clark', 'living', 'glamorous', 'times', 'getting', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'see', 'legend', 'close-up', 'being', 'able', 'go', 'home', 'end', 'day', 'want', 'worship', 'old', 'dead', 'movie', 'stars', 'feel', 'empathy', 'frailities', 'having', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'real-life', 'messiness', 'lives.In', 'fact', 'Marilyn', 'archetypal', 'troubled', 'co-worker', 'who', 'life', 'hell', 'everyone', 'office', 'whom', 'retain', 'certain', 'pity', 'lack', 'truly', 'tragic', 'tone', 'noteworthy', 'given', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'only', '5', 'years', 'making', 'film', 'Olivier.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'shallow', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'substantial', 'film', 'Prince', 'Showgirl', 'more', 'real-life', 'angst']",My Week with Marilyn

My Week With Marlyn explores the most famous woman of the mid 20th century, her feelings and her craft.The movie highlights one week during the filming of ""The Prince and the Showgirl,"" staring Sir Laurence Olivier, Marilyn Monroe, and Dame Sybil Thorndike.  The movie  was to be Sir Laurence's film triumph and Marilyn debut as a serious actress.  The methods of Olivier and Monroe clashed, so the set was destined to be tense.""My Week"" is essentially a love story.  Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) a young assistant new to films is smitten with Marilyn.  Marilyn struggles with psychological problems from her youth.  Eddie reaches out to Marlyn and tries to comfort her and listen to her fits of fear stimulated by a low self image.  They become friends.To me the best part of this movie is the acting.  Michelle Williams is outstanding as Marilyn.  Williams captures the internal struggles Monroe lived.  Williams is a believable Monroe who portrays her loneliness, frustration and insecurities.  She shows Marilyn's escapism to a fun self in an attempt to combat her emotions.  Somehow Williams senses that Marilyn Monroe is simply a character that Norma Jeane Mortensen Baker (Marilyn's birth name) sees as a role she projects to the public.Redmayne portrays well  Colin Clark, the love struck boy who somehow is blessed with being able to understand Marilyn and provide her the friend she needs.  Judi Dench is brilliant as Dame Sybil Thorndike, and Emma Watson is delightful as Lucy.I enjoyed this film.

Reviewer,"[1, 2]","Yeah, like you I read the reviews and was prepared not to like this film, especially Michelle Williams.But, although it is not ""completely"" Marilyn, it is definitely not Michelle on the screen.  Michelle does capture the essence of Marilyn without doing a parody.  It is her best role to date. It is a good script, with good photography.The point the movie really makes is Norma Jean Baker knew she was not Marilyn Monroe.  She wanted to be loved for Norma Jean, but she lost that persona through the sexual abuse in her teens, and was left with the fictional Marilyn.She acted on stage and off.
