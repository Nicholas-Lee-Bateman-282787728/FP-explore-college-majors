Otherwise, I can say confidently that her DVDs never disappoint. This is not for beginners; I say this because if you are a beginner, you are probably not yet interested in the complexities and nuances of Arabic music, as you are still trying to learn the moves in general.Because my background is in Western music, all the music tips were very helpful. I have been waiting with baited breath to find a DVD which relates the Minor Scales and Western Modes to the Maqamat, but people always say, ""They're totally different."" Newsflash: They're NOT. Yes, I get the quarter-tone/half-flat thing, yes, there are many maqamat, but you can relate them, and she does. As a musician, I would have liked a graphic illustration of the form of a general taqsim to appear somewhere, which would include the rise and fall of the form back to each tonic and when we switch to a new tonic, with the general format of the end of a taqsim. She does a good job in general explaining the format, but a visual graphic would have helped. I had an America musician do this for me at a music camp once, and remembering this has helped me immensely. Again, I know that taqsims can last for hours, and there is no set format, blah blah blah, but in a shorter setting there is a general way of ""how it goes"" per se.Honestly, the most informative part of this DVD was the explanations of the music. There are some general guidelines for dancing a taqsim, but because it is so spontaneous and personal, the dance explanation does not have to go on all day or else it gets into the realm of no longer helpful. I always do enjoy her visual prop examples (the squeeze pillow, etc.) and think her references are very helpful.What could be explained more with the dancing, and is a cornerstone of Ranya's technique, and may deserve a DVD of its own, is the breathing and all the pelvic floor talk. Ranya assumes those who are viewing the DVD know about these, and I feel she could go a little further on about it.I enjoyed the notes at the bottom of the screen, and did learn some things I hadn't previously known. Her credits are also very extensive and helpful (it drives me nuts when they don't tell you what music it is and how to get it).I would give this a four out of five for information included versus what it could be, and give it a 6 out of 5 in comparison to every other Bellydance DVD on the market. There are no bette DVDs out there than Ranya's - I have seen a TON. She does not waste time with crappy workout and stretch fillers (see my other reviews if you don't know what I mean) because there is enough pertinent and necessary information in each to get through MORE than the usual two hour length.",5,BUY THIS IF YOU ARE A SERIOUS DANCER,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,2751,"['only', 'Ranya', 'DVD', 'have', 'yet', 'find', 'Classical', 'Orientale', 'Otherwise', 'can', 'say', 'confidently', 'DVDs', 'never', 'disappoint', 'not', 'beginners', 'say', 'are', 'beginner', 'are', 'probably', 'not', 'yet', 'interested', 'complexities', 'nuances', 'Arabic', 'music', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'learn', 'moves', 'general.Because', 'background', 'Western', 'music', 'music', 'tips', 'were', 'very', 'helpful', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'baited', 'breath', 'find', 'DVD', 'Minor', 'Scales', 'Western', 'Modes', 'Maqamat', 'people', 'always', 'say', ""'re"", 'totally', 'different', 'Newsflash', ""'re"", 'NOT', 'Yes', 'get', 'quarter-tone/half-flat', 'thing', 'yes', 'are', 'many', 'maqamat', 'can', 'relate', 'musician', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'graphic', 'illustration', 'form', 'general', 'taqsim', 'appear', 'somewhere', 'would', 'include', 'rise', 'fall', 'form', 'back', 'tonic', 'when', 'switch', 'new', 'tonic', 'general', 'format', 'end', 'taqsim', 'good', 'job', 'general', 'explaining', 'format', 'visual', 'graphic', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'had', 'America', 'musician', 'do', 'music', 'camp', 'once', 'remembering', 'helped', 'immensely', 'Again', 'know', 'taqsims', 'can', 'last', 'hours', 'set', 'format', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'shorter', 'setting', 'general', 'way', 'how', 'se.Honestly', 'most', 'informative', 'part', 'DVD', 'was', 'explanations', 'music', 'are', 'general', 'guidelines', 'dancing', 'taqsim', 'so', 'spontaneous', 'personal', 'dance', 'explanation', 'not', 'have', 'go', 'day', 'else', 'realm', 'longer', 'helpful', 'always', 'do', 'enjoy', 'visual', 'prop', 'examples', 'squeeze', 'pillow', 'etc', 'think', 'references', 'are', 'very', 'helpful.What', 'could', 'be', 'explained', 'more', 'dancing', 'cornerstone', 'Ranya', 'technique', 'may', 'deserve', 'DVD', 'own', 'breathing', 'pelvic', 'floor', 'talk', 'Ranya', 'who', 'are', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'know', 'feel', 'could', 'go', 'little', 'further', 'it.I', 'enjoyed', 'notes', 'bottom', 'screen', 'did', 'learn', 'things', 'had', ""n't"", 'previously', 'known', 'credits', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'extensive', 'helpful', 'nuts', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'music', 'how', 'get', 'would', 'give', 'four', 'five', 'information', 'included', 'versus', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'give', '6', '5', 'comparison', 'other', 'Bellydance', 'DVD', 'market', 'are', 'bette', 'out', 'there', 'Ranya', 'have', 'seen', 'TON', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'crappy', 'workout', 'stretch', 'fillers', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'enough', 'pertinent', 'necessary', 'information', 'get', 'MORE', 'usual', 'two', 'hour', 'length']",Bellydance Taqasim - Improvisation Skills & Drills

Every time I walk away from practice with one of them, I feel as if I learned a little bit more about rhythm structures, nuances, and egyptian style bellydance in general. I am so happy that she offers more than just technique in her material but that her DVDs focuses on musicality  and expression. That is the reason why I love this DVD also.Because instead of just drilling movements (Which I think is needed as well but the market is over-saturated with technique DVDs) she lets you move to the music and express it. This DVD has also helped in my improvisation, much more that other BD videos have that is on the market.She fills a much needed niche in the dance community and for ""me"" personally I go through every lengths to get DVDs or instruction on musicality by reputable instructors. The only complaint I would say is the performance was 20minutes and 12 seconds, and I wasn't a fan of the piece.I believe the dvd is open level, or rather I think the DVD offers something for everyone. I enjoyed her letting the different instrument players have a chance to talk a little about the instrument and music produced. This is not a dvd that you will use one time, but definitely one that you will have to digest in chunks. If this DVD had been priced at an Iamed price It would still be worth it. This DVD contains lots of demonstrations and lots of chances to practice. I only have two words for this DVD.

One of my students introduced me to the video and I was so happy she did.  The entire video is very informative.  I learned so much about the instruments used and how the taqasim begins and ends.  Reyna breaks down the different kinds of taqasims and shows the movements that can be used with the various solo instruments.  Also, you get to hear what each instrument sounds like which is very helpful as well as the construction or development of Egyptian rhythms and music. This is a must have for every belly dancer who is interested in Egyptian dancing and music.

1461855,A2OG83SEU9HL6D,B005IFK660,"Shannon B Davis ""Nepenthe""","[25, 25]","At 155 minutes, this DVD is something a dancer can work with for a long time.  In fact, I've owned this DVD for some time, and I hadn't reviewed it yet because I hadn't felt that I'd really worked in depth with every section.  This DVD is about interpreting the taqasim. For professional dancers, the taqasim is often encountered in one's live music set.  Some dancers are afraid of it, but due to this DVD - and other instructors I've had - I personally relish the opportunity to be lost in the tarab between musician and dancer.  As much as I had worked with musicians before, this DVD brought my knowledge to a whole new level.  Now, owners of Ranya's Beledi DVD know just how much detail Ranya can pack into a DVD.  These DVDs are for the intellectuals of belly dance, who want to understand the music at a much deeper level.LikeBellydance Egyptian Style - The Baladi - 2-DVD Set, Bellydance Taqasim gives you an opportunity to meet the musicians.  The musicians talk about their instruments.  Ranya and the musicians demonstrate the maqamat (roughly equivalent to Western scales), as well as the qualities of different instruments.  Between the maqamat and the instrument, a dancer understands how to emotionally respond and express the music with her body.  This DVD even covers how to dance to vocal improvisation - aka the mawwal.  The instruments covered are Oud, Qanoun, Nay, Violin and Vocals. The only thing missing is the clarinet, which is more of a Turkish instrument as I understand it.  Musically, I have never seen a dance DVD with so much information about music.  Ranya really helps you HEAR the music, like when she points at the screen indicating every time a certain note is being hit.  It will change how you hear music.  I do have to admit that I still have trouble distinguishing the maqamat, aside from my favorite - Nahawand.  I don't know what it would take to learn that, as I have an audio CD covering the topic as well as this CD, and have had them demonstrated by live musicians.  I guess it would take years of study.  But at any rate, musically, you cannot get better than this DVD. I also have Bellydance Opulent Motion - The Artistry of Slow Moves, which focuses on taqsims, and it doesn't touch on any of these topics.  If you want to dance to taqasims like you wrote them yourself - this is the DVD to teach you to get that inside-out understanding of the music.  The DVD includes a glossary of musical terms - both Arabic and English.  To name a few - qafla, maqamat, tarjama and tremolo, tonic and octave!In the improvisation section, you can follow along with Ranya - or close your eyes and dance alone.  Either way, she guides you verbally - either talking about dance and movement, or about the music.  Like the baladi DVD, you can run the improvisation drills in different ways - focusing on an instrument, or a style of taqsim.  You can also play the tracks without voiceovers.There is also a large section of performance advice, quickly going from one to the next.  It could be followed along physically or watched as a lecture if one were injured but still wanted to experience dance.  Taqasims can be so serious - but Ranya makes them amusing.  Who else has props - and I'm not talking about veils and canes - to teach dance?  At one point, she demonstrates the quality of a movement with a memory-foam pillow!  She has a conversational style of speaking that will put the viewer at ease.I find that these are the kind of DVDs, by the way, that I can pop in for a few moments of practice - going directly to a section I want to work on.  Whoever does the titling/menuing on these DVDs is a genius who really understands how dancers want to consume DVDs. THANK YOU.A great companion DVD is Karim Nagi's DVD on musicality (available from Karim himself), where he also talks about taqsims. They both approach the material in different, yet compatible ways.I learned a lot of new things in this DVD.  For the record, this DVD is appropriate for all levels from beginner to advanced.  A beginner would use the movements he or she knows to interpret the taqasim and would learn a lot about the music.  Even an advanced performer might not know all of the information here.  It really ranges - again, not unlike the Baladi DVD.  I get the feeling that it's important to Ranya to be able to teach different levels, as it occurs to me thatBellydance Egyptian Style - Modern Orientalalso had choreography for different levels too.Ranya is an amazing dancer who is becoming well-known.  Her range is quite amazing.  Most dancers have one specialty and make a DVD about that.  Ranya Renee has three DVDs out, on three completely different topics.  And I'm sure she has more to teach us - I hope she will be making more DVDs in the future.",5,another hit ....,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,4775,"['155', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'something', 'dancer', 'can', 'work', 'long', 'time', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'DVD', 'time', 'had', ""n't"", 'reviewed', 'yet', 'had', ""n't"", 'felt', ""'d"", 'really', 'worked', 'depth', 'section', 'DVD', 'interpreting', 'taqasim', 'professional', 'dancers', 'taqasim', 'often', 'encountered', 'one', 'live', 'music', 'set', 'dancers', 'are', 'afraid', 'due', 'DVD', 'other', 'instructors', ""'ve"", 'had', 'personally', 'relish', 'opportunity', 'be', 'lost', 'tarab', 'musician', 'dancer', 'As', 'much', 'had', 'worked', 'musicians', 'before', 'DVD', 'brought', 'knowledge', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'Now', 'owners', 'Ranya', 'Beledi', 'DVD', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'detail', 'Ranya', 'can', 'pack', 'DVD', 'DVDs', 'are', 'intellectuals', 'belly', 'dance', 'who', 'want', 'understand', 'music', 'much', 'deeper', 'level.LikeBellydance', 'Egyptian', 'Style', 'Baladi', '2-DVD', 'Set', 'Bellydance', 'Taqasim', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'musicians', 'musicians', 'talk', 'instruments', 'Ranya', 'musicians', 'demonstrate', 'maqamat', 'roughly', 'equivalent', 'Western', 'scales', 'as', 'well', 'qualities', 'different', 'instruments', 'maqamat', 'instrument', 'dancer', 'how', 'emotionally', 'respond', 'express', 'music', 'body', 'DVD', 'even', 'how', 'dance', 'vocal', 'improvisation', 'mawwal', 'instruments', 'covered', 'are', 'Oud', 'Qanoun', 'Nay', 'Violin', 'Vocals', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'clarinet', 'more', 'Turkish', 'instrument', 'understand', 'Musically', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'dance', 'DVD', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'music', 'Ranya', 'really', 'HEAR', 'music', 'when', 'screen', 'indicating', 'time', 'certain', 'note', 'being', 'hit', 'will', 'change', 'how', 'hear', 'music', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'still', 'have', 'trouble', 'distinguishing', 'maqamat', 'aside', 'favorite', 'Nahawand', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'would', 'take', 'learn', 'that', 'have', 'audio', 'CD', 'covering', 'topic', 'as', 'well', 'CD', 'have', 'had', 'demonstrated', 'live', 'musicians', 'guess', 'would', 'take', 'years', 'study', 'rate', 'musically', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'DVD', 'also', 'have', 'Bellydance', 'Opulent', 'Motion', 'Artistry', 'Slow', 'Moves', 'taqsims', ""n't"", 'touch', 'topics', 'want', 'dance', 'taqasims', 'wrote', 'DVD', 'teach', 'get', 'inside-out', 'understanding', 'music', 'DVD', 'glossary', 'musical', 'terms', 'Arabic', 'English', 'name', 'few', 'qafla', 'maqamat', 'tarjama', 'tremolo', 'tonic', 'octave', 'improvisation', 'section', 'can', 'follow', 'along', 'Ranya', 'close', 'eyes', 'dance', 'alone', 'way', 'verbally', 'talking', 'dance', 'movement', 'music', 'baladi', 'DVD', 'can', 'run', 'improvisation', 'different', 'ways', 'focusing', 'instrument', 'style', 'taqsim', 'can', 'also', 'play', 'tracks', 'voiceovers.There', 'also', 'large', 'section', 'performance', 'advice', 'quickly', 'going', 'one', 'next', 'could', 'be', 'followed', 'physically', 'watched', 'lecture', 'one', 'were', 'injured', 'still', 'wanted', 'experience', 'dance', 'Taqasims', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'serious', 'Ranya', 'amusing', 'Who', 'else', 'props', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'veils', 'canes', 'teach', 'dance', 'one', 'point', 'quality', 'movement', 'memory-foam', 'pillow', 'conversational', 'style', 'speaking', 'will', 'put', 'viewer', 'ease.I', 'find', 'are', 'kind', 'DVDs', 'way', 'can', 'pop', 'few', 'moments', 'practice', 'going', 'directly', 'section', 'want', 'work', 'titling/menuing', 'DVDs', 'genius', 'who', 'really', 'how', 'dancers', 'want', 'consume', 'DVDs', 'THANK', 'YOU.A', 'great', 'companion', 'DVD', 'Karim', 'Nagi', 'DVD', 'musicality', 'available', 'Karim', 'where', 'also', 'taqsims', 'approach', 'material', 'different', 'yet', 'compatible', 'ways.I', 'learned', 'lot', 'new', 'things', 'DVD', 'record', 'DVD', 'appropriate', 'levels', 'beginner', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'would', 'use', 'movements', 'interpret', 'taqasim', 'would', 'learn', 'lot', 'music', 'Even', 'advanced', 'performer', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'information', 'here', 'really', 'again', 'not', 'Baladi', 'DVD', 'get', 'feeling', 'important', 'Ranya', 'be', 'able', 'teach', 'different', 'levels', 'thatBellydance', 'Egyptian', 'Style', 'Modern', 'Orientalalso', 'had', 'choreography', 'different', 'levels', 'too.Ranya', 'amazing', 'dancer', 'who', 'becoming', 'well-known', 'range', 'quite', 'amazing', 'Most', 'dancers', 'have', 'one', 'specialty', 'make', 'DVD', 'Ranya', 'Renee', 'three', 'DVDs', 'out', 'three', 'completely', 'different', 'topics', ""'m"", 'sure', 'more', 'teach', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'making', 'more', 'DVDs', 'future']",Bellydance Taqasim - Improvisation Skills & Drills
