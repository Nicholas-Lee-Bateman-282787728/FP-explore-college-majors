1319523,A1URPQ4S8TJCR4,B00331RHC2,Bert vanC Bailey,"[0, 0]","A fine made-for-TV film about John Mortimer's fictionalized recollections of his father. And Mortimer's really the shining star in this - which you'll like if you know the Rumpole series and incline towards the testy but amusing, sometimes whacky take on things conjured there, or in 'Paradise Postponed' or his other work, written or playacted.Lawrence Olivier makes the most of his advanced age to turn out a delightfully cranky Dad. (If I read any more about Dustin Hoffman's Methodist misgivings about Sir Larry, this'll be recalled as counterevidence: he gets things across without all the self-torture.) Alan Bates is a bit old for his part here, but does well in a few key scenes in this secondary, not terrifically fulsome role. And Jane Asher - who once taught Liverpudlian Macca about art and theatre and modern classical music  - is unusually convincing in her role as a challenging, almost-likeable worthy opponent to the opinionated Dad-in-law (her role, incidentally, became merely Mortimer's first wife).This should especially appeal to anyone who's spent time with relatives who are or, with age, have turned self-centred, pernickety, and a bit too assured about every last thing they say. What's refreshing is Mortimer's talent to remind us that we do retain affection, despite all.(It's close captioned, too!)At under an hour-and-a-half long, it was time very well spent.",4,Mortimer's portrayal of cranky yet endearing father,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,1389,"['fine', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'John', 'Mortimer', 'fictionalized', 'recollections', 'father', 'Mortimer', 'really', 'shining', 'star', ""'ll"", 'like', 'know', 'Rumpole', 'series', 'incline', 'towards', 'testy', 'amusing', 'sometimes', 'whacky', 'take', 'things', 'conjured', 'there', ""'Paradise"", 'Postponed', 'other', 'work', 'written', 'playacted.Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'most', 'advanced', 'age', 'turn', 'out', 'delightfully', 'cranky', 'Dad', 'read', 'more', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Methodist', 'misgivings', 'Sir', 'Larry', ""'ll"", 'be', 'recalled', 'counterevidence', 'things', 'self-torture', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'bit', 'old', 'part', 'here', 'well', 'few', 'key', 'scenes', 'secondary', 'not', 'terrifically', 'fulsome', 'role', 'Jane', 'Asher', 'who', 'once', 'taught', 'Liverpudlian', 'Macca', 'art', 'theatre', 'modern', 'classical', 'music', 'unusually', 'convincing', 'role', 'challenging', 'almost-likeable', 'worthy', 'opponent', 'opinionated', 'Dad-in-law', 'role', 'incidentally', 'became', 'merely', 'Mortimer', 'first', 'wife', '.This', 'should', 'especially', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'who', 'spent', 'time', 'relatives', 'who', 'are', 'age', 'have', 'turned', 'self-centred', 'pernickety', 'bit', 'too', 'assured', 'last', 'thing', 'say', 'What', 'refreshing', 'Mortimer', 'talent', 'remind', 'do', 'retain', 'affection', 'close', 'captioned', 'too', 'hour-and-a-half', 'long', 'was', 'time', 'very', 'well', 'spent']",N/A

Unfortunately, the story is dark, bitter, and nasty, and Olivier, as the father, makes your flesh crawl.  Bates is entirely miscast. A child actor played the son through 1936.  And then, when the war is on, three years later or so, the son suddenly is a 40-year-old.  It doesn't work at all.

1319526,A2YZT1Y2FSNZ66,B00331RHC2,Charles Lempriere,"[0, 0]","This well-written telemovie by John Mortimer about his barrister father is meticulously filmed and cast. Laurence Olivier's form of ham is well-suited to the brilliant, mercurial, drama queen that is Mr Mortimer Q.C. Alan Bates adds another slightly fussy and effete performance to his gallery of wishy-washy men as John. Bates actually has to act in certain scenes and is very effective when he does. Olivier is entertaining throughout. The talented Jane Asher as Bates's wife gives a nice, strong, natural performance as does Elizabeth Sellars as Olivier's wife. An intelligent script about the chasm that exists between a father and his son, beautifully observed but no easy answers or penetrating insights into what makes these bright, difficult characters tick.(Or why the old man can be such an inveterate stinker).Certainly worth watching.",5,Ham and Eggs for Dinner,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,846,"['well-written', 'telemovie', 'John', 'Mortimer', 'barrister', 'father', 'meticulously', 'filmed', 'cast', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'form', 'ham', 'well-suited', 'brilliant', 'mercurial', 'drama', 'queen', 'Mr', 'Mortimer', 'Q.C', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'slightly', 'fussy', 'effete', 'performance', 'gallery', 'wishy-washy', 'men', 'John', 'Bates', 'actually', 'act', 'certain', 'scenes', 'very', 'effective', 'when', 'Olivier', 'entertaining', 'talented', 'Jane', 'Asher', 'Bates', 'wife', 'nice', 'strong', 'natural', 'performance', 'Elizabeth', 'Sellars', 'Olivier', 'wife', 'intelligent', 'script', 'chasm', 'father', 'son', 'beautifully', 'observed', 'easy', 'answers', 'penetrating', 'insights', 'what', 'bright', 'difficult', 'characters', 'tick', 'why', 'old', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'such', 'inveterate', 'stinker', '.Certainly', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
1319527,A2NSM7DL6TX32G,B00331RHC2,Frank R. Southerington,"[0, 0]","I can't agree with the reviewer who found this movie dark and depressing (as if a good story HAS to be cheerful).  It's bitter-sweet, certainly, and we can indeed wonder whether Olivier's character is magnificently stoical or (justifiably) angry (the question seems to be naturally in the script) .  What shines through, however, is an intelligent script, often funny and sometimes tear-provoking,  and a magnificent cast.  It become almost meaningless to say that Olivier is ""at the height of"" his powers, since he was hardly ever anything less, and is always surpising, invigorating, new, and ASTONISHING (even when he is ""dark""). His range is unequalled and, even in a quiet movie, adventurous--none of his finest contemporaries equals his courage and inventiveness.  But his fellow actors are all at the height of their powers, too.  The first encounter between Olivier and Jane Asher deserves to be among the most celebrated, touching, triumphant moments of both careers, and of the cinema. I bought this movie simply on the basis of a brief (90-second?) extract, and because of my admiration for the actors.

1319528,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B00331RHC2,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[10, 10]","A very touching drama of a father/son relationship, both being lawyers, with both portraying actors no longer living. The father, Clifford Mortimer (Laurence Olivier) lost his sight while his son, John (Alan Bates-'Gosford Park'), was a youth. The story is a period tale, beginning about the time of WWII, but the son grows up, engages in following his father's law career, but preferring writing. The family, at the desire of the father, pretends there is no sight handicap. It is never even mentioned. The man goes about his gardens, fighting the bugs, and having others describe the beauty. He seems to refrain from facing reality, or has he become so perfectly adapted to his handicap? Should the viewer be inspired or feel pity for the man?John ages, marries Elizabeth (Jane Asher-'Brideshead Revisited'), and the father/son relationship continues sometimes in conflict, sometimes humorous, sometimes surprising. This, as often in stories with these 2 actors, makes the viewer think and become engaged in the intellect of the characters. Elizabeth Sellars ('Shiralee') plays Clifford's wife, John's mother.The DVD reminds you sometimes of a play format (this was adapted from the original stage play), except the sets are much more elaborate and much of the footage was actually done on the English estate of the writer, in Oxfordshire. The countryside is beautiful, as rewarding as the performances. _________SUBTITLES are available.The writer, John Clifford Mortimer, the man who created ""Rumpole of the Bailey"", obviously used his own real life as a divorce lawyer like his father's divorce law practice, John's sight problems, and even his statement about being raised ""entirely on the profits of adultery"" a dialogue line used in the performance. Like the son in the story, Mortimer wrote and practiced law at the same time, successful in both. Mortimer died in January, 2009, so there will be no new legal drama stories coming from this great British writer. Both of the 2 leading men have also died, Olivier in 1989 and Bates in 2003. This DVD is a testimony to the skills of all 3 men.Additional Lawrence Olivier presentations can be seen in a good DVD set titled ""Laurence Olivier Presents"" for those who enjoy this performance.
