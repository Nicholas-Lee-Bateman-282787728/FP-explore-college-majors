All the movies have a Ken Johnson commentary track. The first four movies have ""Making of"" featurettes that are a bit dry, but have some great nuggets. The first four also have gag reels. All the movies have a wide of array of stills in a photo gallery.The last movie's disc side includes a 25-minute reunion taped at Johnson's home in January 2007. Everyone's there except for Sean Six/Buck. It's amazing! I got a warm feeling just watching! It opens with candid meet and greets and sitting down to a meal. They gather in a circle next, and really start to talk. The actors talk about being cast, about make-up, about the movies, and about the reaction from various ethnic groups, among other things. There are some great behind-the-scenes shots from the original series that I've never seen anywhere else.Dark Horizon is fine, but man, were they hitting on all four cylinders for the second movie--Body and Soul. It features an excellent story and script, a satisfying Matt and Cathy story, and a few twists and turns that you won't expect. Everything that made the series great is on display in the second movie--the comic timing, the chemistry between the actors, the jokes, the names, you name it, it's there--it's like a time machine back to the good old days of the show's weekly run.  The last three are just as good--the atmosphere and feeling of the season is there in full force.  I wasn't crazy about George's promotion at the end of the original series because it wrecked the detectives' dynamic, but found that they dealt with it very well in the movies for both characters.Buck and Emily don't have much to do in the first two movies, but they come into their own in the last three. Cathy and Matt's romance evolves beautifully throughout.  If you think of the five movies as 10 episodes of Alien Nation--it's like a whole half season.Pocket put out 8 Alien Nation novels and novelizations back in the day, so we had those to get over the cliffhanger when the complete series set came out a couple of years ago.

Dark Horizon is the best one and the season ending. Just for that one movie, it's well worth the money. Body and Soul is pretty good, especially if you want to see Sikes and Cathy trying to reconcile their feelings.  It holds up the best of the series episodes.Millenium is ok and watchable.  The Udara Legacy has issues.  I didn't like it.  I never saw it on tv, so I went in cold on that. I guess it was ok, but I didn't care much for it.  The Enemy Within was awful.  It shouldn't have been made and it was a wasted effort to watch.Of the 5 movies, 2 were well worth the price.  One was tolerable and one was barely tolerable.  The last one was awful.  It took the worst of the old B movies and wallowed in it.  I'm still glad I got the collection, just for Dark Horizon, Body and Soul, and Millenium.

It's main theme is to teach us the folly of prejudice.  And a wonderful job it does, too!The best science fiction doesn't scream SCIENCE FICTION in your face.  It tells us an interesting story to which we can relate and involves us with the characters and their situations.  Alien Nation certainly accomplishes that.  Even with the unusual traditions, physiological differences and bald, spotted heads - not to mention their excellent language - the Tenctonese people are very human in both their similarities and their infinite diversity.The series was a delight to watch and many of us were crushed when it ended, especially with some cliffhangers.  Then - SURPRISE! - about 5 years later, the first movie came out.  Of course we didn't know it was the first of five, but we were all VERY happy that we would finally know what happens to Susan and Emily. Will Matt and Cathy will ever begin their relationship for real?  The first movie ""Dark Horizons"" answers these questions and many more.All of the five movies were well scripted, beautifully acted, interesting and believable stories (from the we-believe-in-this-universe point of view) and stayed true to the established characters and events.  The production values were wonderful and we managed to get all the most important questions answered before it all ended.This 5-movie DVD set is also great because EVERY movie has commentary, at least one featurette (like a ""Making of"" or a cast reunion reel), a gag reel AND still galleries.  There are also a few other bonuses.  Excellent bonus material fare!If you love Alien Nation, this set is great!
