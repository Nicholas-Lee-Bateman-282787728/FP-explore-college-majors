This was the case with the first Cube. Cube I was a brilliant movie.  It showed us how strangers tried to escape what seemed to be an impossible trap.  The plot of the film was as unpredictable as the next cubical room.  I immensely enjoyed the first Cube but I was somewhat disappointed with the second installment, the Hypercube.  The idea of the Hypercube was more elaborate and underdeveloped at the same.  The Hypercube tried to be more complex than the original for no particular reason.  The greatest beauty comes from simplicity.Once again there are characters trying to escape a deadly trap.  Early on we can see that the new cube functions differently than the one before.  Unlike in the previous installment the characters of Hypercube cannot get a single clue to what is going on.  There seemed to be no pattern whatsoever.  This is probably the greatest failure of Hypercube.  Things start happening for no reason in a bizarre fashion.  While the movie started out intriguing it ended with a mess.  The ending of Hypercube was also unsatisfying but in a different way then the original.  And above all, it is still very frustrating to see how people can never work with each other in time of danger.However, I cannot label Hypercube as a complete failure.  Hypercube is enjoyable especially to the fans of the original.  I recommend renting it.",3,Started great and ended with a mess,1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,1497,"['Occasionally', 'film', 'interesting', 'premise', 'wonder', 'how', 'something', 'so', 'simple', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'original', 'was', 'case', 'first', 'Cube', 'Cube', 'was', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'showed', 'how', 'strangers', 'tried', 'escape', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'impossible', 'trap', 'plot', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'unpredictable', 'next', 'cubical', 'room', 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'Cube', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'second', 'installment', 'Hypercube', 'idea', 'Hypercube', 'was', 'more', 'elaborate', 'underdeveloped', 'same', 'Hypercube', 'tried', 'be', 'more', 'complex', 'original', 'particular', 'reason', 'greatest', 'beauty', 'simplicity.Once', 'again', 'are', 'characters', 'trying', 'escape', 'deadly', 'trap', 'Early', 'can', 'see', 'new', 'cube', 'functions', 'differently', 'one', 'before', 'previous', 'installment', 'characters', 'Hypercube', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'single', 'clue', 'what', 'going', 'seemed', 'be', 'pattern', 'whatsoever', 'probably', 'greatest', 'failure', 'Hypercube', 'Things', 'start', 'happening', 'reason', 'bizarre', 'fashion', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'intriguing', 'ended', 'mess', 'ending', 'Hypercube', 'was', 'also', 'unsatisfying', 'different', 'way', 'then', 'original', 'still', 'very', 'frustrating', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'never', 'work', 'other', 'time', 'danger.However', 'can', 'not', 'label', 'Hypercube', 'complete', 'failure', 'Hypercube', 'enjoyable', 'especially', 'fans', 'original', 'recommend', 'renting']",N/A

I am huge fan of the first Cube and I always knew (since I heard that this was in works actually) that this sequel was not going to blow the first one out of the water. It's basically the same thing all over again and the only better thing about it is the visual aspect. The story line took a difference approach to it and the actors had some really cheesy lines which made me roll eyes quite a few times. However, this is a straight to video/dvd release so I guess everything was expected. All in all, the damn movie takes place in a Cube! What more can you really do that wasn't done and explained in the first one?In the first movie the Cube the atmosphere was much more suspenseful and the characters were just plain better and generally seemed terrified with their situation. Sadly in Cube, some of the characters just did not display the same genuine fear that the first cast had. It almost seemed like a joke at certain parts. By all means, the cast was good, it's just that the script was weak and they could not do a whole lot. Cube 2 also focuses on different things that the first one, more of a 'fantasy' and nothing exists type of deal which just made the movie seem like one of those nightmare flicks with a different universe which often seems like a cheap way out of a good story that just did not have a good ending in the first place>Visually, this movie was stunning. The music was good and suspenseful but everything else was unfortunately below the bar. When it all comes down to  it, this is a fun movie to watch on cable or even a decent rental from your local video store if you happen to be a huge fan of the original Cube.

I understand that the first gained a lot of popularity in the home video market, which prompted someone to try and cash in with a sequel, but this didn't really seem like a sequel, but more of a flashy remake of the original that couldn't cut it.  I really liked the original, and I was curious about this one.  What I found were slick special effects, some decent acting, but very little of the charm that the original had.  And this whole new concept of the cube crossing into the 4th dimension, distorting time, space, reality, etc. was kinda hard to swallow.  To me, that was like the makers of the movie were saying &quot;Hey, it's a dimensional thing, so we can do whatever we want, and you have to accept it.&quot;  The original relied more on charatcers and story, while the sequel relied too heavily on special effects and the popularity of the first one.  I wasn't expecting this one to be as good as the first, but I was disappointed at the lack of originality.  It was like they took the first one, threw in a bunch of special effects, and drained out all the charm.  Not bad, but not good, either.  In the first movie, relationships were actually developed with the characters, and you began to care about what happened to them.  Some you didn't want to see get hurt, which helped build suspense, while others you were waiting for them to get what was coming to them.  In this movie, there was very little or none of that.  I could have cared less what happened to any of the characters.

739556,A2XWU6Y8PF8L17,B00008DDVY,"CreepyT ""CreepyTendencies""","[13, 14]","The original ""Cube"" movie was incredibly original, scary, and thought provoking.  Unfortunately, the sequel did not live up to the grandeur of its predecessor.  In fact, it fell quite short and pales in comparison (as sequels often do).  In the original movie, we are introduced to a group of people who have been dropped into a large cube against their will.  Together they must find a way to get out of this nightmare realm without losing their lives in the process.  Various rooms within this cube are plagued with horrific traps, and to avoid the traps the group must break the mathematical code that the giant maze operates on.In this sequel, we are introduced to a similar band of characters who are placed into the cube against their will, and again they try to find their way out of the awful waking nightmare.  However, there are a few twists this time.  In the Hypercube (a somewhat far-fetched theory in both physics and mathematics) the people are not only traveling through 3 dimensions, but four.  In other words, these unsuspecting and unwilling participants must face variants of gravity and time within each room of the cube.  They come across themselves in alternate realities.  Furthermore, there are traps as in the original film, but they seem to have a supernatural element.  They aren't the simple, explainable mechanical traps that we encountered in the previous film.One thing I enjoyed about the first film was that the concept was somewhat believable.  The maze and traps were mechanical and based on mathematical principles.  There was a solid explanation, and thus a way out.  In the sequel, there really was no big mystery (mathematical problem) to resolve.  Furthermore, in the original film, the group of people stuck in the cube were all there for a purpose.  They were specifically chosen so that they could each bring strengths to the group in order for them to find a way out.  In this film, however, the group of people was chosen merely because they were affiliated with a specific company that made the cube, and thus needed to be eliminated for knowing too much.  In addition, the group of characters weren't developed as much in this film as they were in the previous one.  Thus, you, the viewer, don't feel as compelled to see them make it through the cube.The ending, unfortunately, left something to be desired.  Many things are left up in the air.  You are left with the notion that there might be a third film.  If that does turn out to be the case, I certainly hope that more thought and attention goes into making that movie than went into this one.Overall, I'd say that this movie is a renter and not a keeper.  It has it's good moments, and it is an interesting concept, but not as well done as the first movie (which I think should be in everyone's collection).",3,"Intriguing, but falls short of its predecessor",1082764800,"04 24, 2004",2004,2812,"['original', 'Cube', 'movie', 'was', 'incredibly', 'original', 'scary', 'thought', 'provoking', 'Unfortunately', 'sequel', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'grandeur', 'predecessor', 'fact', 'fell', 'quite', 'short', 'pales', 'comparison', 'sequels', 'often', 'do', 'original', 'movie', 'are', 'introduced', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'dropped', 'large', 'cube', 'will', 'Together', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'nightmare', 'realm', 'losing', 'lives', 'process', 'Various', 'rooms', 'cube', 'are', 'plagued', 'horrific', 'traps', 'avoid', 'traps', 'group', 'must', 'break', 'mathematical', 'code', 'giant', 'maze', 'sequel', 'are', 'introduced', 'similar', 'band', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'placed', 'cube', 'will', 'again', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'awful', 'waking', 'nightmare', 'However', 'are', 'few', 'twists', 'time', 'Hypercube', 'somewhat', 'far-fetched', 'theory', 'physics', 'mathematics', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'traveling', '3', 'dimensions', 'four', 'other', 'words', 'unsuspecting', 'unwilling', 'participants', 'must', 'face', 'variants', 'gravity', 'time', 'room', 'cube', 'come', 'alternate', 'realities', 'Furthermore', 'are', 'traps', 'original', 'film', 'seem', 'have', 'supernatural', 'element', 'are', ""n't"", 'simple', 'explainable', 'mechanical', 'traps', 'encountered', 'previous', 'film.One', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'concept', 'was', 'somewhat', 'believable', 'maze', 'traps', 'were', 'mechanical', 'based', 'mathematical', 'principles', 'was', 'solid', 'explanation', 'thus', 'way', 'out', 'sequel', 'really', 'was', 'big', 'mystery', 'mathematical', 'problem', 'resolve', 'Furthermore', 'original', 'film', 'group', 'people', 'stuck', 'cube', 'were', 'purpose', 'were', 'specifically', 'chosen', 'so', 'could', 'bring', 'strengths', 'group', 'order', 'find', 'way', 'out', 'film', 'however', 'group', 'people', 'was', 'chosen', 'merely', 'were', 'affiliated', 'specific', 'company', 'made', 'cube', 'thus', 'needed', 'be', 'eliminated', 'knowing', 'too', 'much', 'addition', 'group', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'developed', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'were', 'previous', 'one', 'Thus', 'viewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'compelled', 'see', 'make', 'cube.The', 'ending', 'unfortunately', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'Many', 'things', 'are', 'left', 'up', 'air', 'are', 'left', 'notion', 'might', 'be', 'third', 'film', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'case', 'certainly', 'hope', 'more', 'thought', 'attention', 'making', 'movie', 'went', 'one.Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'renter', 'not', 'keeper', 'good', 'moments', 'interesting', 'concept', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'first', 'movie', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'everyone', 'collection']",N/A

The cell is 14 foot on each side and there is a hatch one each of the four walls and on the floor and ceiling, each leading to another identical cell. You have to find your way out of the complex before you die of thirst, but your way is beset by lethal (and rather gruesome) boobytraps and the rising tensions and in-fighting between your companions.That was the opening paragraph to my review of the first Cube film and it does a pretty good job for the second - to the extent that Hypercube can legitimately be described as a remake of its progenitor. Some changes have been wrought, but they are essentially the same film. Now, Hypercube has pretty much split the field in the Amazon review section, giving it an overall three star rating.If you saw and enjoyed Cube 1 then I find it hard to understand what you can dislike about Hypercube. I believe that the majority of changes are either neutral or for the better. The set design has changed substabtially and the Cube is now a ""virtual construct existing in four dimensions"" (as we theoretical mathematicians* like to say). This adds a (literally) new dimension to the plot, as travel between cells becomes rather less predictable. Everything is now white, shiny and brightly lit, bringing a different, surgical feel to the film as opposed to the original's industrial atmosphere. There's a lot more CGI in this outing but, in the main, it's done quite well and doesn't overwhelm the feel of the film. There are some rather hokey props - the dessicated corpses could have been done a lot better.The actors are neither substantially better or worse in this film than the last (slightly better, I'd say although I was hoping for ""Mrs Paley"" to get bumped off a lot sooner than she was**). The booby traps in the first film have changed; they're fewer in number and don't all come at the beginning of the film so that they are, in consequence, somewhat less predictable. Finally, we gain a little more insight into the origin and reasons behind the Cube - not a lot but enough to whet the appetite.Of course, the main objection may simply be ""why remake a perfectly acceptable film, so soon (3 years) after the original?"" A perfectly reasonable question, I grant you but not, in my opinion, valid if the remake is better than the original which this is (albeit only just).Overall, then, I firmly believe that this film works at least as well as Cube 1 and in some places slightly better. I gave the first film three stars and I would give this one a half a star on that, rounded up to a four star rating.* I'm not a theoretical mathematician. I just made that up.** Not a spoiler. Read the film's blurb - ""only one will survive"" and it's a good bet that it won't be the senile old lady!",4,OK sci fi,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,2869,"['wake', 'up', 'floor', 'cell', 'five', 'other', 'people', 'none', 'whom', 'can', 'remember', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'cell', '14', 'foot', 'side', 'hatch', 'one', 'four', 'walls', 'floor', 'ceiling', 'leading', 'identical', 'cell', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'complex', 'die', 'thirst', 'way', 'beset', 'lethal', 'rather', 'gruesome', 'boobytraps', 'rising', 'tensions', 'in-fighting', 'companions.That', 'was', 'opening', 'paragraph', 'review', 'first', 'Cube', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'second', 'extent', 'Hypercube', 'can', 'legitimately', 'be', 'described', 'remake', 'progenitor', 'changes', 'have', 'been', 'wrought', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'film', 'Now', 'Hypercube', 'pretty', 'much', 'split', 'field', 'Amazon', 'review', 'section', 'giving', 'overall', 'three', 'star', 'rating.If', 'saw', 'enjoyed', 'Cube', '1', 'then', 'find', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 'can', 'dislike', 'Hypercube', 'believe', 'majority', 'changes', 'are', 'neutral', 'better', 'set', 'design', 'changed', 'substabtially', 'Cube', 'now', 'virtual', 'construct', 'existing', 'four', 'dimensions', 'theoretical', 'mathematicians*', 'say', 'literally', 'new', 'dimension', 'plot', 'travel', 'cells', 'rather', 'less', 'predictable', 'Everything', 'now', 'white', 'shiny', 'brightly', 'lit', 'bringing', 'different', 'surgical', 'feel', 'film', 'opposed', 'original', 'industrial', 'atmosphere', 'lot', 'more', 'CGI', 'outing', 'main', 'done', 'quite', 'well', ""n't"", 'overwhelm', 'feel', 'film', 'are', 'rather', 'hokey', 'props', 'dessicated', 'corpses', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'lot', 'better.The', 'actors', 'are', 'substantially', 'better', 'worse', 'film', 'last', 'slightly', 'better', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'hoping', 'Mrs', 'Paley', 'get', 'bumped', 'off', 'lot', 'sooner', 'was**', 'booby', 'traps', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'changed', ""'re"", 'fewer', 'number', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'come', 'beginning', 'film', 'are', 'consequence', 'somewhat', 'less', 'predictable', 'Finally', 'gain', 'little', 'more', 'insight', 'origin', 'reasons', 'Cube', 'not', 'lot', 'enough', 'whet', 'appetite.Of', 'course', 'main', 'objection', 'may', 'simply', 'be', 'why', 'remake', 'perfectly', 'acceptable', 'film', 'so', 'soon', '3', 'years', 'original', 'perfectly', 'reasonable', 'question', 'grant', 'not', 'opinion', 'valid', 'remake', 'better', 'original', 'only', 'just', '.Overall', 'then', 'firmly', 'believe', 'film', 'least', 'as', 'well', 'Cube', '1', 'places', 'slightly', 'better', 'gave', 'first', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'would', 'give', 'one', 'half', 'star', 'rounded', 'up', 'four', 'star', 'rating', '*', ""'m"", 'not', 'theoretical', 'mathematician', 'just', 'made', 'up', '**', 'Not', 'spoiler', 'Read', 'film', 'blurb', 'only', 'one', 'will', 'survive', 'good', 'bet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'senile', 'old', 'lady']",N/A
739558,ACLYANIZPYUDJ,B00008DDVY,Dave,"[0, 0]","I actually saw this one on the Sci-Fi Channel in 2002 before I saw the original. I thought at that time it was just a Sci-Fi made movie, which explained for the peculiar sets and the strange goings on. I caught it about halfway through, and for some reason continued to watch. The ending had me scratching my head for days. I forgot about it until I found the original on a top horror list site. Then I came here to ""scope it out"" if you will just as I do most movies before I buy them. It was then that I was reintroduced to the Hypercube.

That may well explain any positive reviews received by this insult to average intelligence.Twilight Zone, the old TV series, was light years above this, despite being black and white. The problem is that there is far too little character development, and little meaningful dialogue other than, ""oh sh**, what's happening now?

Stephen King usually takes care to supply a decent answer to this one. So do most other half-way decent writers.After an hour, I took a break to run an errand at a store, and when I came back, decided I really did not care what happened next. The movie did not really present any logical thesis to what was happening, other than mystical references to quantum physics, which apparently allows for anything at all to occur, according to this film.

If you're like me, then maybe you won't mind that this sequel somewhat adheres to that philosophy. CUBE 2: HYPERCUBE doesn't try to change things up too much, still coming with that same claustrophobic premise. Eight strangers are trapped in a series of deadly, constantly shifting cube-shaped rooms and must work together to find a safe exit. Somewhere along the way, we learn a secret or two about these characters. Also somewhere along the way, one or two will crack and go postal.Like most folks, I don't dig this one quite as much as I did the first CUBE, which was so good back in 1997 that it's attained cult classic status. First flaw: not too surprisingly, CUBE 2 is essentially a rehashing of the original so it doesn't register as highly on the freshness meter. Second thing is that, although it's all over the sci-fi aspect or maybe the hard math aspect, CUBE 2 simply isn't as strong in its horror sensibilities, compared to the original or the third entryCube Zero. The rooms here don't bristle with the same level of lethal gristliness. In fact, these cubes may be more elaborately designed but not every chamber is a death trap waiting to be sprung. If memory's in my corner, the very few murder constructs to surface were rendered via weakly realized CG and I just couldn't take them seriously.And while the math tutorial isn't as pronounced, there's plenty of talk regarding temporal anomalies, parallel realities, and quantum teleportation, which to me amounts to a cr@pload of scientific double talk. Basically, introducing the quantum physics element means that the Cube now extends into the fourth dimension, resulting in doppelgangers and rooms which either defy gravity or exist at varying time speeds. Interesting stuff, but I'd rather have more gory kill scenes, please.The cast is good enough that you do get invested in how things turn out for several of them, or at least I did. These are low pedigreed actors, with perhaps Geraint Wyn Davies qualifying as the most familiar face (he was the lead in FOREVER KNIGHT). As with the first movie, the most dangerous factor in the Cube turns out to be the prisoners themselves. It's really not too hard to pick out the movie's psychotic loose cannon. And, as per usual in these enclosed environments, the gradual dissolution of the group dynamics is fascinating to watch.There's an attempt to explain the origin of the Cube, but it's half-heartedly done and, ultimately, we're left almost as much in the dark as before, and I happen to like this. I relish that the sense of enigma is retained, that things aren't clarified perfectly. I think the Cube series works better as a sort of existential metaphor. CUBE ZERO happens to be better than this sequel, but I resented that it went behind the scenes of the cube construct.All in all, I grudgingly enjoyed this movie, managing to stick around all the way thru, mostly because I was curious about the fates of certain characters. But, yeah, CUBE 2 has it share of pitfalls. It strives for a more ambitious story but instead muddies things up with abstract quantum babble. Late in the flick, there's a bizarro makeout session that had me scratching my head. And then comes that weak twist to end the movie. Character-wise, I developed a dislike for the insufferably perky old woman wracked with some sort of dementia. I'm probably going to hell, but when that crazy old woman buys it, I'm saying she had it coming. And her little dog, too.Other than those miscues... good movie. Sort of.",3,"""My head, man!

In fact, it reminds me exactly of those Hollywood-ised remakes of cult B-grade horror/sci-fi films. Yes it has a bigger budget and flashier special effects......but Bigger doesn't equal Better, and you can't help but miss the raw simplicity of the original.While the basics of the two films are the same (small group of diverse characters trapped in the Cube and trying to escape), 'Hypercube' makes several changes, for better and worse. On the plus side, the concept of the fourth dimension opens up a range of possibilities that are utilised well; rooms with time going faster or slower, characters witnessing the future or past, characters meeting alternate versions of themselves. Indeed, one of the best sequences in the film is where one character kills alternate versions of another character over and over again. The bigger budget also allows for more flashy and inventive death traps and other effects, which might interest you if you want eye-candy.But on the negative side, the story is more streamlined and straightforward than the original. Instead of the deliberate mystery of the first 'Cube', there seems to have been a conscious decision to give 'Hypercube' an explicit plot whose pieces all fit together nicely. While this does give the film a clearer ""point"" than 'Cube', I personally prefer the plot device of the original: No Questions, No Answers, Just Get Out. Also, the hardcore sci-fi and mathematics has been replaced with more conventional horror/slasher elements, which make the film feel more like 'Saw' than the original 'Cube'. There's less focus on the characters' attempts at escape, and more interest in killing them off in gruesome and unusual ways.'Hypercube' is not a bad film as such, even if it doesn't measure up to the original.

Barale ""Soul_Wounder""","[4, 15]","The first was one of the best thrillers ever, with clever suspence, good characters, decent acting and awesome effects.This one is... meh. Why must you make a sequel to a huge success hit and turn the franchise into a straight-to-video series? What's the bloody point?Now there are some good parts. The rooms are pretty nice and the musice score is decent, but you know, that doesn't even save it. This movie is a annoying, pointless and downright piece of crap that only kids can easily love. It is so un-intelligent it really makes you wanna puke.The characters are nothing but cardboard cut-outs. I don't even know them well. All they do is scream, run around in the Cube rooms and cannot keep their mouths shut.I also really hate the effects in this one as well. They felt like they were over-used. There is even a scene where a guy gets cut into peices and look how badly done it was.The direction is ok, but when it comes to adding wierdness, it's too much. I don't understand the story, there's a strange sex-scene which a Cube movie does not need. Cube is about suspence. This one is just about adding too much effects, a four-dimensional Cube and trying to make itself look better than the first one. You don't need that stuff. If you wanted to make a sequel better than the first, add something original, don't take itself too seriously and make sure it stays true to the original. But no, you just had to add all this unoiriginal time crap and have alot of special effects taking over and even a sex scene which is not cool because if it's a Cube movie, you don't need nudity.Overall, if you wanna kill off some time by watching this crap, go ahead. I know you like watching people getting killed in unoriginal ways and watching sex scenes. If you're a fan of Cube, dont' bother.Acting: 3/10Ugh, don't get me started. These actors have bad acting skills and I hope they die.Gore Factor: 4/10CGI gore?! Come on!?T&A;: 1/10A Cube movie doesn't need nudity and they don't know that because they don't know Cube.Direction: 7/10Andrzej Sekula did have some visual eye in some parts. I did enjoy a few scenes and I dug the rooms, but you know, I can't say he's a great director. He turned the franchise with straight-to-video written all over it.Bottom Line: If you wanna watch, go ahead, then you'll be sorry.This movie is just sad.

739574,A12W99SK787ZJ9,B00008DDVY,"J. J. Chiappelli ""jjcx""","[7, 9]","Okay, this review is meant specifically for fans of the original. If you haven't seen it or if you did and hated it, then you might actually enjoy Cube 2.This movie is terrible for a long list of reasons, but mostly because it seems to break all of the rules established in the first movie.The original Cube had these merits: 1 - It was a great exploration of human nature. 2 - The purpose and meaning of the Cube was never explained and left to the viewer to find out. 3 - There were a variety of metaphorical (And possibly religious) undertones that led the movie to be interpreted in many ways. 4 - The special effects were limited and used effectively. 5 - It was creepy and suspenseful the whole way through. 6 - The characters were deep and rich with emotional and psychological development. 7 - The actors were good. 8 - The direction was amazing, and the set design / costumes were amazing; they worked flawlessly together to add to the mood. 9 - The ending was ambiguous, but not disappointing. 10 - The movie was satisfying on its own. THERE WAS NO NEED FOR A SEQUEL.Every single one of those merits is either non-existent or even destroyed in Cube 2.The acting? Don't get me started. These are people who seem like they were rejected as extras on a Sci-Fi channel movie. And it doesn't help that the characters they play have absolutely no depth at all. The greatest character arc lays in Simon, who begins as an irritable bully and ends up... uh... as a psychopathic bully. There are 10 characters who are trapped in the cube (Not 8), but they collectively seem to share two, maybe three brain cells.The set design? Boring as hell. They try to stylize it and make some funky doors, but it ends up looking user-friendly; the original Cube looked like something out of Hell, but the Hypercube almost looks inviting.The script? Nonsense. Okay, there were some lines in the first one which weren't exactly thrilling (""Holy Cats!"" comes to mind), but Cube 2 has some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life - and it's consistently terrible throughout. Plus, the logic of the Hypercube is laughable at best.The special effects are terrible. They are lame CGI which looks so unrealistic that it isn't menacing, it's cartoony. Plus, they use CGI too much.Now, all of those complaints knock this down to a 3-star movie. So, why do I revoke the final two stars? Because of one simple reason: The filmmakers (Who aren't the ones that made the original, by the way) tried to create rationale behind the Hypercube.Even though they never explain it fully, they tried to give you the impression that there is a specific, definite purpose behind the Hypercube, and possibly the original Cube. And all of the characters have some kind of reason for being in the Hypercube because they are connected with the company that made it. This ruins everything about the movie - it is no longer suspenseful, it is no longer intriguing and mysterious, it's just boring.I can't seem to stop ranting about this movie... it's so terrible and it's an outrage that they even made it. I'm just confused about why I wanted to see it...VIOLENT CONTENT - Eh. CGI blood. A few cheesy-looking corpses. People punch each other sometimes.LANGUAGE CONTENT - They randomly drop the ""F word"" a few times. That's about all I remember.NUDITY / SEXUAL CONTENT - In one of the movies stupidest and most illogical scenes, two characters get stranded alone and say, ""I know we're trapped in a death machine, but... let's have sex.""

Classified as Horror/Scifi I tend to think of CUBE as a psychological thriller.  After awhile its the characters you are interested in and not the dang CUBE they are in.CUBE 2 I just didn't have that connections.  Gerant Wyn Davies from early 90's good vampire (pre Angel) TV show Forever Night I liked cause he was familiar face, but in reality he became the same character as Quentin was in the first movie.  Actually many of the characters pretty much are just the same in away as the characters in the first one.  Here they added a few more, but overall nothing new.  That bothered me.  CUBE 1 had great feel with the colors of the different rooms.  Cube 2 everything is white and nothing seems dangerous.  The colors added to the intensity, Cube 2 the white didn't do anything for the intensity of the film.If you loved the first Cube I say watch this one.  You actually appreciate the first CUBE a lot better.  Cube 2 wasn't a bad flick at all, its just a part 2 wasn't needed.

The downside is that you have to suffer through 90 minutes of some excruciating stock characters.  And there are at least two actors in the film who, either due to the stiff dialogue they have to recite or due to the limitations of their one-dimensional characters, are painful to watch.But the lead in the film, Canadian actress Kari Matchett, is both very good and very cute, so that took some of the sting away.  She's got great dimples, that Kari!Other than that, many elements of the first film are repeated here:  rooms with unpredictable traps or characteristics, the rapid breakdown of civility, and murder.Some brief behind-the-scenes featurettes are included, some more mind-numbingly technical than others.All in all, not a TOTALLY satisfying film, but a more than decent attempt to take the original story to a different level and conclusion.

739579,A1ZKAHFYCJRGQM,B00008DDVY,Kenneth V. Cockrel,"[2, 3]","""Cube 2: Hypercube"" is a surprisingly effective and thought-provoking sequel to the 1997 cult classic, ""Cube.""In many ways, the fact that the sequel even exists is a testament to the power of the home video market.  After all, the first ""Cube"" didn't exactly break box office records.  If it was released in theaters at all it must have only been on a limited basis.  But after coming out on video and DVD, it became something of a word of mouth phenomenon as viewers who'd been blown away by it rushed to recommend it to friends.In fact, no less a notable film critic than Roger Ebert even praised the film on his show, ""At the Movies,"" noting that he'd gotten e-mails urging him to check it out.  That film's success in the secondary market was clearly big enough to prompt the sequel.Not surprisingly, the basic plot here is identical to the first film.  A group of strangers awaken to find themselves trapped in a mysterious cube containing several interlocking rooms.  They have no memory of how they got there or who is responsible for the cube's existence.As with the first film, each character's motivations, skills, possible connections to the cube, and hidden traits are revealed as the film progresses.  And of course, this cube also contains it's own share of lethal traps.Though one character makes a brief reference to the ""first one,""  ""Cube 2"" is a self-contained film and seeing the first movie isn't essential to enjoying this one.If anything, the movie is actually more ambitious than the first film.  Where the first cube was basically a huge machine with shifting rooms, the Hypercube is rooted in quantum physics technology that allows it to fold space and time.  As the prisoners move from room to room they begin to experience space and time shifts that keep them off balance and guessing about where and when they'll wind up next.The DVD release contains a surprisingly exhaustive documentary on the making of the film, an interview with director Andrzej Sekula and deleted scenes.  Surprisingly, one key deleted scene actually reveals the origins of the Cubes but since this scene was excised from the final release don't be surprised if this story element never rears its head in the inevitable ""Cube 3.""Some fans will doubtless complain about this film's overly talky nature and the fact that it is less violent and action-packed than ""Cube.""  This is not a ""park your brain at the door"" type of movie, but if you're up for the challenge, this film offers more than its share of rewards.Though the character types are, in some cases, too reminiscent of those from the first film, the cast of mostly unknown actors does an able job of fleshing them out.Both these actors and the behind the scenes personnel,  deserve credit for crafting a well-made, ambitious sequel that aims to break new ground rather than walk that already covered by the original film.And though I still prefer the brutal simplicity of the first movie, ""Cube 2: Hypercube"" is a better than average sequel that stands as a worthy installment of what looks likely to be an ongoing film franchise.",3,Solid Sequel to a Cult Classic,1095120000,"09 14, 2004",2004,3092,"['Cube', '2', 'Hypercube', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'thought-provoking', 'sequel', '1997', 'cult', 'classic', 'Cube', 'many', 'ways', 'fact', 'sequel', 'even', 'testament', 'power', 'home', 'video', 'market', 'first', 'Cube', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'break', 'box', 'office', 'records', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'must', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'limited', 'basis', 'coming', 'out', 'video', 'DVD', 'became', 'something', 'word', 'mouth', 'phenomenon', 'viewers', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'blown', 'away', 'rushed', 'recommend', 'friends.In', 'fact', 'less', 'notable', 'film', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'even', 'praised', 'film', 'show', 'Movies', 'noting', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'e-mails', 'urging', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'success', 'secondary', 'market', 'was', 'clearly', 'big', 'enough', 'prompt', 'sequel.Not', 'surprisingly', 'basic', 'plot', 'here', 'identical', 'first', 'film', 'group', 'strangers', 'awaken', 'find', 'trapped', 'mysterious', 'cube', 'containing', 'several', 'interlocking', 'rooms', 'have', 'memory', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'who', 'responsible', 'cube', 'existence.As', 'first', 'film', 'character', 'motivations', 'skills', 'possible', 'connections', 'cube', 'hidden', 'traits', 'are', 'revealed', 'film', 'course', 'cube', 'also', 'own', 'share', 'lethal', 'one', 'character', 'brief', 'reference', 'first', 'one', 'Cube', '2', 'self-contained', 'film', 'seeing', 'first', 'movie', ""n't"", 'essential', 'enjoying', 'one.If', 'anything', 'movie', 'actually', 'more', 'ambitious', 'first', 'film', 'Where', 'first', 'cube', 'was', 'basically', 'huge', 'machine', 'shifting', 'rooms', 'Hypercube', 'rooted', 'quantum', 'physics', 'technology', 'fold', 'space', 'time', 'prisoners', 'move', 'room', 'room', 'begin', 'experience', 'space', 'time', 'shifts', 'keep', 'off', 'balance', 'guessing', 'where', 'when', ""'ll"", 'wind', 'up', 'next.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'surprisingly', 'exhaustive', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'interview', 'director', 'Andrzej', 'Sekula', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Surprisingly', 'one', 'key', 'deleted', 'scene', 'actually', 'origins', 'Cubes', 'scene', 'was', 'excised', 'final', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'story', 'element', 'never', 'head', 'inevitable', 'Cube', '3', 'fans', 'will', 'doubtless', 'complain', 'film', 'overly', 'talky', 'nature', 'fact', 'less', 'violent', 'action-packed', 'Cube', 'not', 'park', 'brain', 'door', 'type', 'movie', ""'re"", 'up', 'challenge', 'film', 'more', 'share', 'character', 'types', 'are', 'cases', 'too', 'reminiscent', 'first', 'film', 'cast', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'actors', 'able', 'job', 'fleshing', 'actors', 'scenes', 'personnel', 'deserve', 'credit', 'crafting', 'well-made', 'ambitious', 'sequel', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'rather', 'walk', 'already', 'covered', 'original', 'film.And', 'still', 'prefer', 'brutal', 'simplicity', 'first', 'movie', 'Cube', '2', 'Hypercube', 'better', 'average', 'sequel', 'worthy', 'installment', 'what', 'likely', 'be', 'ongoing', 'film', 'franchise']",N/A
739580,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00008DDVY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 6]","There was a point while watching ""Cube 2: Hypercube"" that I found myself thinking this movie was half as good as the original, therefore it deserved half the rating I gave ""Cube.""  The other movie I was reminded of, strangely enough, was ""A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge,"" because that was another time where I found myself wondering if the people who made the sequel had watched the original.  Yes, we once again have a group of strangers making their way through a series of cubes, wondering how they got there, what is going on, and how they are supposed to get out.But whereas ""Cube"" was grounded in reality to the extent that if you had the money and the resources you could create a maze like that, ""Cube 2: Hypercube"" goes the science fiction route where the laws of physics do not apply, especially to the laws of time and space. Consequently, this 2002 film from director Andrzej Sekula does not really qualify as a sequel because except from the notion of the cube maze and one character's complaints that there are no numbers and that the first one had rules, there is nothing that really connects the first film with this one.  That cold, hard fact is reinforced by comparing the conclusions to the two films, which try to play with the audience's minds in totally different ways.  No wonder so many people are bitterly disappointed when they see this one.  I did not care that the first film did not provide answers to wrap everything up, and I was rather insulted by what ""Hypercube"" tries to pawn off on us in its place at the end.The alternative hypothesis for watching this film is that if you are like the characters in the film who are smart enough to have a reasonable but convoluted explanation for what is going on, then you may be able to appreciate this film on a level that most of us are just not going to be able to access.  For that matter, if this was the first ""Cube"" movie it would have picked up another star.  The tag line in the trailer for ""Cube 2"" is ""There are no rules,"" which makes it clear the makers of this film are only too happy to embrace the idea that they have thrown out everything that made the original film so engrossing.  The creative death traps that were in some of the cubes were what gave the first film its edge, but here we have some weird entity whose setup is not worth the payoff.The characters are similar to the first time around, although there are more of them so that the potential body count can be a lot higher, which is not really a good thing given that we have lost the creative ways of meeting death in the cubes from last time (you can see how impossible it is to judge this film without using the original as the frame of reference and the standard for condemnation).  In ""Cube"" there were some interesting character dynamics going on and we had the feeling that the maze was more a psychological test than anything else, where the trapped humans were the key resource needed to get out alive, but too many of them were busy losing it to work together successfully to get everybody out alive.  At least in the first film if you did not like a character there was the possibility of a gruesome death involving razor wire or other interesting things.  No such luck here.I should have known this film was in trouble as soon as I saw the inside of the first cube, which was bigger, brighter and cleaner than the smaller, darker and dirtier cubes of (altogether now) the original film.  Maybe their big mistake was in thinking that using the same cube again would not go over with fans.  Let me just say I think they were wrong.  I am going to be watching ""Cube Zero"" next and I have to admit I am apprehensive because I have to be open to the possibility it could be even worse than this one.  Maybe, if I am lucky, I can pretend ""Cube 2: Hypercube"" never took place and pretend ""Cube Zero"" is the true sequel.If you are a physicist and actually like what they say is going on in this film, then you will probably enjoy the DVD extras here.  You have a director's commentary by Sekula that goes along with the documentary on the special effects, both of which will give you a better idea of what is happening in the film than watching the film itself.  One of the problems with this film turns out to be that they were driven by what neat CGI effects they could come up with more so than by the story (another big and classic movie making mistake).  You also get some deleted scenes (including an alternate ending which adds insult to injury because it tries to insist that there is a logical connection between the two films even if we ordinary folk are too stupid to figure it out), several trailers, storyboard and stills galleries, none of which will help you like ""Cube 2: Hypercube"" more than ""Cube.""",2,"Maybe there is a ""Cube 1.5"" out

739581,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00008DDVY,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[6, 8]","Lawrence Bernabo recently reviewed this movie, and one of his comments was that if you were a physicist you would enjoy the extras. Well, I have a degree in physics and while not quite a physicist, I must admit that there were aspects of this otherwise pointless movie that I enjoyed.""Cube 2 - Hypercube"" was likely filmed on the theory that the original ""Cube"" did sufficiently well that they could milk the concept for a second movie. The original ""Cube"" had enough going for it in the novelty department that a viewer could ignore the stereotypical characters and the somewhat vague plot (why would anyone create anything so expensive?). Unfortunately, this time the cube part of the movie is no longer novel, the acting is no better and probably worse than the original, and plot, which is conveniently and unsatisfactorily explained at the end of the movie, is even murkier.Just as in the original ""Cube,"" we have a group of people who have apparently been kidnapped by persons unknown from their otherwise normal lives and dropped into a box consisting of cubed rooms. Just as in the original ""Cube,"" the individual cubes appear to move in some unfathomable fashion. So your first question is, what is the difference? In this movie we do not have nice, simple methods of death like flame throwers, cutters and other sundry and relatively mundane devices. In this movie we have all sorts of quantum effects that slice and dice people, in the most gruesome and theoretically audience-attracting way possible.The cube device I had lost interest in, and I initially was going to pass this movie by, but I was desperate one day and thought I would try something different. I also figured that the characters would be as uni-dimensional as they were in the previous movie. I may have missed something, but these characters appeared to be less than one dimensional, but I am not sure that zero dimensions actually exist. I was also annoyed that the minimal character dynamics that were exploited at least to minimal effect in the first movie were missing in this movie. However, what did catch my interest where the new methods of death.There were these sort of interesting spinney things, there were these holes that might make you think of a sort of quantum drain and several other things that were fascinating in a ""gee what an interesting CGI effect"" sort of way. For reasons that were not explained, being subjected to these phenomena often generated a lot of blood and caused a fair amount of screaming. I kept watching the movie to see what different way the next character was going to die, which is really the only point to watching this movie.Now, you have to wonder, which I did, why anyone would want to watch a movie when the only purpose of doing so is seeing how the next character died. Sometimes I am a little slow in catching on, and in this case that was when I realized that I was watching this movie for a bad reason. Of course, I had to finish the movie, just to say I did, and I really regretted it. I will not tell you how the movie ends, on the off chance that you will watch it, but I will tell you that I was disappointed. I had the ""I can't believe I watched the whole thing"" sort of reaction.It is a rare movie that I watch to the end and find wish I could take the experience back, but even now I still wonder why I bothered to watch the whole thing. I think I was hoping for some revelation at the end of the movie that was going to put the movie into a perspective where I thought the movie had some measure of value. Not a chance. The acting is weak, the plot is nearly non-existent, and the script is even weaker.This movie has one redeeming quality, which is why it gets two stars, and that is the special effects. A movie should not have special effects as the only reason to watch it, because then you may as well turn the sound off and play a Pink Floyd CD while the movie is playing.",2,Huh?,1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,3921,"['Lawrence', 'Bernabo', 'recently', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'one', 'comments', 'was', 'were', 'physicist', 'would', 'enjoy', 'extras', 'Well', 'have', 'degree', 'physics', 'not', 'physicist', 'must', 'admit', 'were', 'aspects', 'otherwise', 'pointless', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'Cube', '2', 'Hypercube', 'was', 'likely', 'filmed', 'theory', 'original', 'Cube', 'did', 'sufficiently', 'well', 'could', 'milk', 'concept', 'second', 'movie', 'original', 'Cube', 'had', 'enough', 'going', 'novelty', 'department', 'viewer', 'could', 'ignore', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'somewhat', 'vague', 'plot', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'create', 'anything', 'so', 'expensive', 'Unfortunately', 'time', 'cube', 'part', 'movie', 'no', 'longer', 'novel', 'acting', 'better', 'probably', 'worse', 'original', 'plot', 'conveniently', 'unsatisfactorily', 'explained', 'end', 'movie', 'even', 'murkier.Just', 'original', 'Cube', 'have', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'apparently', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'persons', 'otherwise', 'normal', 'lives', 'dropped', 'box', 'consisting', 'cubed', 'rooms', 'Just', 'original', 'Cube', 'individual', 'cubes', 'appear', 'move', 'unfathomable', 'fashion', 'first', 'question', 'what', 'difference', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'nice', 'simple', 'methods', 'death', 'flame', 'throwers', 'cutters', 'other', 'sundry', 'relatively', 'mundane', 'devices', 'movie', 'have', 'sorts', 'quantum', 'effects', 'slice', 'dice', 'people', 'most', 'gruesome', 'theoretically', 'audience-attracting', 'way', 'possible.The', 'cube', 'device', 'had', 'lost', 'interest', 'initially', 'was', 'going', 'pass', 'movie', 'was', 'desperate', 'one', 'day', 'thought', 'would', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'also', 'figured', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'uni-dimensional', 'were', 'previous', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'something', 'characters', 'appeared', 'be', 'less', 'one', 'dimensional', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'zero', 'dimensions', 'actually', 'exist', 'was', 'also', 'annoyed', 'minimal', 'character', 'dynamics', 'were', 'exploited', 'least', 'minimal', 'effect', 'first', 'movie', 'were', 'missing', 'movie', 'However', 'what', 'did', 'catch', 'interest', 'where', 'new', 'methods', 'death.There', 'were', 'sort', 'interesting', 'spinney', 'things', 'were', 'holes', 'might', 'make', 'think', 'sort', 'quantum', 'drain', 'several', 'other', 'things', 'were', 'fascinating', 'gee', 'what', 'interesting', 'CGI', 'effect', 'sort', 'way', 'reasons', 'were', 'not', 'explained', 'being', 'subjected', 'phenomena', 'often', 'generated', 'lot', 'blood', 'caused', 'fair', 'amount', 'screaming', 'kept', 'watching', 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'different', 'way', 'next', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'really', 'only', 'point', 'watching', 'movie.Now', 'have', 'wonder', 'did', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'when', 'only', 'purpose', 'doing', 'so', 'seeing', 'how', 'next', 'character', 'died', 'Sometimes', 'am', 'little', 'slow', 'catching', 'case', 'was', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'bad', 'reason', 'course', 'had', 'finish', 'movie', 'just', 'say', 'did', 'really', 'regretted', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'how', 'movie', 'off', 'chance', 'will', 'watch', 'will', 'tell', 'was', 'disappointed', 'had', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'sort', 'reaction.It', 'rare', 'movie', 'watch', 'end', 'find', 'wish', 'could', 'take', 'experience', 'back', 'even', 'now', 'still', 'wonder', 'why', 'bothered', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'think', 'was', 'hoping', 'revelation', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'put', 'movie', 'perspective', 'where', 'thought', 'movie', 'had', 'measure', 'value', 'Not', 'chance', 'acting', 'weak', 'plot', 'nearly', 'non-existent', 'script', 'even', 'weaker.This', 'movie', 'one', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'why', 'two', 'stars', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'special', 'effects', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'then', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'sound', 'play', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'CD', 'movie', 'playing']",N/A

On the other hand, their structures are so blatantly philosophical, so unabashadly symbolic, it's kind of a treat to sit back and fiddle with the concepts it represents. Sorta the same way you'd fill in a few of the boxes on a crossword puzzle you know you're never going to finish. It's addictive like that; a plate of cheese that people talk around even as they pick it apart.And if you're wondering if these plates have the kind of cheese you like, then this review is for you.CUBE - People wake up in a labyrinthine cube with no idea of how they got there or why they've been kidnapped. They must navigate through a series of deadly traps, without knowing just what it is they're headed for (or even where it is). A doctor, a famous escapist, a cop, a mentally handicapped fella -- personalities clash, and what could've been a tight little parable of existentialism becomes a squabbling social commentary about the brutality of big, mean men. It's tense, but not paced particularly well, although the ending has a thankful spot of hope. Like the Rubik's Cube, most people will find this cube compelling for a few twists and turns, but are unlikely to find the ending all that rewarding. 3 1/2 stars.CUBE 2 - HYPERCUBE - The cube has gone hyper! Dimensional that is. Gone is the first cube's relentless dankness, replaced here by sterile, unapologetic white. Although the new cube is also fraught with hidden perils, these are mostly of the multidimensional variety. What this means for you, the viewer, is that the traps are now CGI contraptions that look not convincing in the least. It also means that many rooms have their own gravity and ""variable time speeds."" Oh, I almost forgot, the most awesome thing it means is that it exists in multiple dimensions at once, so there are apparently about fifteen different copies of each person wandering around at the same time.Did I say ""awesome""? I'm sorry. I meant ""unfortunate."" Because this cube has basically no rules, virtually anything can happen, making what DOES happen less important in the long run. We've got some crazy characters -- a senile physicist, a blind girl, a private detective, a video game desinger and a lawyer -- and they all have connections with a scary-big corporation named Izon, but who cares? The least plot driven of the three movies, this film is also the darkest (in spite of how well-lit each frame is). And, of course, it succumbs to the same mistake as the first film. Instead of being about the little people coming to terms with the bizarre futility of their circumstances, it devolves into a big man going crazy and chasing everyone around with a knife. 2 stars.CUBE ZERO - I don't know why they called this CUBE ZERO instead of CUBE CUBED. Maybe it's supposed to be a prequel, but I doubt it. It's possible they just thought ""zero"" sounded better than ""three."" Or maybe it's because, for the first time ever, the viewer is treated to life outside of the cube.Don't worry. The cube is still there, just as gloomy and lethal as ever (and in far more vividly gross ways), but the group of people inside the box are at least as important as the people watching them. The watchers in this case are a couple of be-jumpsuited guys named Wynn and Dodd who sit around, play chess, and record people's dreams. These guys give the series a chance to do some more overt navel-gazing, but the end effect isn't that bad, even if it mostly just feels like a Pinter play. Specifically, THE DUMBWAITER. (Read it. It's good.)Still, no matter how full of dread and terror his plays were, Pinter always kept the terrible and dreaded things off-stage. When Wynn begins to question his duties, eventually taking drastic measures to get some answers, he causes chaos in and out of the cube. Enter three of the dreaded higher-ups. An effete and over-acted character named Jax pops in, followed closely by two well-groomed go-fers. (Everytime Jax talked to them, I could swear he was calling them Thin and Quickly, but the credits list them as Finn and Quigley.) They are heralded with whimsically creepy violin music, like an incidental theme song, and although they aren't fooling around, their presence makes the whole thing far less ominous than it normally would.Still, the wackiness they provde is menacing and self-assured, and it disguises a story with far more heart and smarts than its predecessors. Even if the story contains, yet again, a big, angry man chasing people around, that is a minor part of the much larger, much more hopeful picture. Satisfying in a lot of ways, this film also pays homage to fans who've endured the films from the beginning. 4 stars",2,Cube Cubed,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,4823,"['find', 'experiencing', 'two', 'schools', 'thought', 'when', 'CUBE', 'series', 'one', 'hand', 'are', 'poorly', 'acted', 'mostly', 'redundant', 'plots', 'predictable', 'dialogue', 'other', 'hand', 'structures', 'are', 'so', 'blatantly', 'philosophical', 'so', 'unabashadly', 'symbolic', 'kind', 'treat', 'sit', 'back', 'fiddle', 'concepts', 'Sorta', 'same', 'way', ""'d"", 'fill', 'few', 'boxes', 'crossword', 'puzzle', 'know', ""'re"", 'never', 'going', 'finish', 'addictive', 'plate', 'cheese', 'people', 'talk', 'around', 'even', 'pick', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'plates', 'have', 'kind', 'cheese', 'then', 'review', 'you.CUBE', 'People', 'wake', 'up', 'labyrinthine', 'cube', 'idea', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'why', ""'ve"", 'been', 'kidnapped', 'must', 'navigate', 'series', 'deadly', 'traps', 'knowing', 'just', 'what', ""'re"", 'headed', 'even', 'where', 'doctor', 'famous', 'escapist', 'cop', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'fella', 'personalities', 'clash', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tight', 'little', 'parable', 'existentialism', 'squabbling', 'social', 'commentary', 'brutality', 'big', 'mean', 'men', 'tense', 'not', 'paced', 'particularly', 'well', 'ending', 'thankful', 'spot', 'hope', 'Rubik', 'Cube', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'cube', 'compelling', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'unlikely', 'find', 'ending', 'rewarding', '3', '1/2', 'stars.CUBE', '2', 'HYPERCUBE', 'cube', 'gone', 'hyper', 'Dimensional', 'Gone', 'first', 'cube', 'relentless', 'dankness', 'replaced', 'here', 'sterile', 'unapologetic', 'white', 'new', 'cube', 'also', 'fraught', 'hidden', 'perils', 'are', 'mostly', 'multidimensional', 'variety', 'What', 'viewer', 'traps', 'are', 'now', 'CGI', 'contraptions', 'look', 'not', 'convincing', 'least', 'also', 'many', 'rooms', 'have', 'own', 'gravity', 'variable', 'time', 'speeds', 'Oh', 'almost', 'forgot', 'most', 'awesome', 'thing', 'multiple', 'dimensions', 'once', 'are', 'apparently', 'fifteen', 'different', 'copies', 'person', 'wandering', 'around', 'same', 'time.Did', 'say', 'awesome', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'meant', 'unfortunate', 'cube', 'basically', 'rules', 'virtually', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'making', 'what', 'DOES', 'happen', 'less', 'important', 'long', 'run', ""'ve"", 'got', 'crazy', 'characters', 'senile', 'physicist', 'blind', 'girl', 'private', 'detective', 'video', 'game', 'desinger', 'lawyer', 'have', 'connections', 'scary-big', 'corporation', 'named', 'Izon', 'who', 'least', 'plot', 'driven', 'three', 'movies', 'film', 'also', 'darkest', 'spite', 'how', 'well-lit', 'frame', 'course', 'same', 'mistake', 'first', 'film', 'Instead', 'being', 'little', 'people', 'coming', 'terms', 'bizarre', 'futility', 'circumstances', 'big', 'man', 'going', 'crazy', 'chasing', 'everyone', 'knife', '2', 'stars.CUBE', 'ZERO', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'called', 'CUBE', 'ZERO', 'instead', 'CUBE', 'CUBED', 'Maybe', 'supposed', 'be', 'prequel', 'doubt', 'possible', 'just', 'thought', 'zero', 'sounded', 'better', 'three', 'maybe', 'because', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'viewer', 'treated', 'life', 'cube.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'cube', 'still', 'there', 'just', 'gloomy', 'lethal', 'ever', 'far', 'more', 'vividly', 'gross', 'ways', 'group', 'people', 'box', 'are', 'least', 'as', 'important', 'people', 'watching', 'watchers', 'case', 'are', 'couple', 'be-jumpsuited', 'guys', 'named', 'Wynn', 'Dodd', 'who', 'sit', 'around', 'play', 'chess', 'record', 'people', 'dreams', 'guys', 'give', 'series', 'chance', 'do', 'more', 'overt', 'navel-gazing', 'end', 'effect', ""n't"", 'bad', 'even', 'mostly', 'just', 'feels', 'Pinter', 'play', 'Specifically', 'DUMBWAITER', 'Read', 'good', 'Still', 'matter', 'how', 'full', 'dread', 'terror', 'plays', 'were', 'Pinter', 'always', 'kept', 'terrible', 'dreaded', 'things', 'off-stage', 'When', 'Wynn', 'question', 'duties', 'eventually', 'taking', 'drastic', 'measures', 'get', 'answers', 'chaos', 'cube', 'Enter', 'three', 'dreaded', 'higher-ups', 'effete', 'over-acted', 'character', 'named', 'Jax', 'pops', 'followed', 'closely', 'two', 'well-groomed', 'go-fers', 'Everytime', 'Jax', 'talked', 'could', 'swear', 'was', 'calling', 'Thin', 'Quickly', 'credits', 'list', 'Finn', 'Quigley', 'are', 'heralded', 'whimsically', 'creepy', 'violin', 'music', 'incidental', 'theme', 'song', 'are', ""n't"", 'fooling', 'around', 'presence', 'whole', 'thing', 'far', 'less', 'ominous', 'normally', 'would.Still', 'wackiness', 'provde', 'menacing', 'self-assured', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'heart', 'smarts', 'predecessors', 'Even', 'story', 'contains', 'yet', 'again', 'big', 'angry', 'man', 'chasing', 'people', 'minor', 'part', 'much', 'larger', 'much', 'more', 'hopeful', 'picture', 'Satisfying', 'lot', 'ways', 'film', 'also', 'homage', 'fans', 'who', ""'ve"", 'endured', 'films', 'beginning', '4', 'stars']",N/A

739585,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00008DDVY,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","Cube 2: Hypercube is actually a sequel to the highly successful if little known sci-fi exercise in hopeless existentialism, Cube.  The premise is that a bunch of complete strangers wake up in a series of interconnected cubes.  There are ladders and doors in all six panels of the room.  Traps await the unwary, but the real danger is, as Sartre famously quoted in No Exit, ""other people.""What made Cube more than two hours of torture was the mathematical puzzle that powered the environment.  Because the cube was a three-dimensional environment, it came with certain rules that could be puzzled out.  Hypercube adds a fourth dimension, time, and that changes the rules significantly.The poor saps stuck in the cube this go round include: Rebecca Young (Greer Kent) who went missing into the Cube, Simon Grady (Geraint Wyn Davies) the private investigator hired to find her, Sasha the blind girl with a mysterious past (Grace Lynn Kung), Max Reisler (Matthew Ferguson) the gaming geek, Jerry Whitehall (Neil Crone) the architectural designer, Juila Sewell (Lindsey Connell) the hot attorney, the irritating Alzheimer's afflicted Mrs. Paley (Barbara Gordon), and finally Kate Filmore (Kari Matchett) a psychologist with a dark past and our protagonist.Like the first movie, Hypercube dumps our mysterious characters right into the grand guignol. Unlike Cube, Hypercube explains how they got there.  All of the characters have a past to an organization known as Izon.  This nefarious organization doesn't take kindly to failure, and all our characters are flawed in some way. Without hope, our characters revert to their basest natures.  For Max and Julia, it's lust.  For Simon, it's violence.  For Sasha and Kate, it's deception.Unfortunately, there are long stretches of talking wherein Jerry explains how hypercubes (also known as a tesseract) work.  Because it exists in more than three dimensions, just about anything is possible, including parallel realities. Which means there's no reasonable chance for our protagonists to escape, except for the distinct possibility that in another reality, they already DID escape. Once the parallel world concept is introduced, Hypercube really comes into its own.  Remember, there's no food in the cube...The special effects are minimal and the traps are less inventive than the first.  Hypercube is more concerned about the possibilities of alternate dimensions than it is about killing people off, relying instead on the inevitable backstabbing.  Although there is a tantalizing series of clues as to the true nature of the hypercube, it's a bit of a feint - figuring it out doesn't help the characters escape or give them much of an advantage.  This is a refreshing twist for jaded moviegoers and a depressing downer for those who are looking for a satisfying conclusion.To the director's credit, Hypercube is relentless in its cynicism.  If Cube was existentialist, its sequel is nihilistic.",4,Nihilism at its Finest,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,2939,"['2', 'Hypercube', 'actually', 'sequel', 'highly', 'successful', 'little', 'known', 'sci-fi', 'exercise', 'hopeless', 'existentialism', 'Cube', 'premise', 'bunch', 'complete', 'strangers', 'wake', 'up', 'series', 'interconnected', 'cubes', 'are', 'ladders', 'doors', 'six', 'panels', 'room', 'Traps', 'unwary', 'real', 'danger', 'Sartre', 'famously', 'quoted', 'No', 'Exit', 'other', 'people', 'What', 'made', 'Cube', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'torture', 'was', 'mathematical', 'puzzle', 'powered', 'environment', 'cube', 'was', 'three-dimensional', 'environment', 'came', 'certain', 'rules', 'could', 'be', 'puzzled', 'out', 'Hypercube', 'fourth', 'dimension', 'time', 'rules', 'significantly.The', 'poor', 'saps', 'stuck', 'cube', 'go', 'round', 'include', 'Rebecca', 'Young', 'Greer', 'Kent', 'who', 'went', 'missing', 'Cube', 'Simon', 'Grady', 'Geraint', 'Wyn', 'Davies', 'private', 'investigator', 'hired', 'find', 'Sasha', 'blind', 'girl', 'mysterious', 'past', 'Grace', 'Lynn', 'Kung', 'Max', 'Reisler', 'Matthew', 'Ferguson', 'gaming', 'geek', 'Jerry', 'Whitehall', 'Neil', 'Crone', 'architectural', 'designer', 'Juila', 'Sewell', 'Lindsey', 'Connell', 'hot', 'attorney', 'irritating', 'Alzheimer', 'afflicted', 'Mrs.', 'Paley', 'Barbara', 'Gordon', 'finally', 'Kate', 'Filmore', 'Kari', 'Matchett', 'psychologist', 'dark', 'past', 'protagonist.Like', 'first', 'movie', 'Hypercube', 'mysterious', 'characters', 'right', 'grand', 'guignol', 'Cube', 'Hypercube', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'characters', 'have', 'past', 'organization', 'known', 'Izon', 'nefarious', 'organization', ""n't"", 'take', 'kindly', 'failure', 'characters', 'are', 'flawed', 'way', 'hope', 'characters', 'revert', 'basest', 'natures', 'Max', 'Julia', 'lust', 'Simon', 'violence', 'Sasha', 'Kate', 'deception.Unfortunately', 'are', 'long', 'stretches', 'talking', 'wherein', 'Jerry', 'how', 'hypercubes', 'also', 'known', 'tesseract', 'work', 'more', 'three', 'dimensions', 'just', 'anything', 'possible', 'including', 'parallel', 'realities', 'Which', 'reasonable', 'chance', 'protagonists', 'escape', 'distinct', 'possibility', 'reality', 'already', 'DID', 'escape', 'parallel', 'world', 'concept', 'introduced', 'Hypercube', 'really', 'own', 'Remember', 'food', 'cube', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'minimal', 'traps', 'are', 'less', 'inventive', 'first', 'Hypercube', 'more', 'concerned', 'possibilities', 'alternate', 'dimensions', 'killing', 'people', 'relying', 'instead', 'inevitable', 'backstabbing', 'tantalizing', 'series', 'clues', 'true', 'nature', 'hypercube', 'bit', 'feint', 'figuring', 'out', ""n't"", 'help', 'characters', 'escape', 'give', 'much', 'advantage', 'refreshing', 'twist', 'jaded', 'moviegoers', 'depressing', 'downer', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.To', 'director', 'credit', 'Hypercube', 'relentless', 'cynicism', 'Cube', 'was', 'existentialist', 'sequel', 'nihilistic']",N/A

O'Blenis,"[1, 1]","""Hypercube"" launches with the same basic premise as ""Cube"" - strangers awakening in different chambers that interconnect inside this vast, cryptic structure.  And while it's not on a level with its masterpiece predecessor, it's also not (in my opinion) anywhere close to being as bad as its reputation seems to have placed it.  In fact, it's a very good movie in its own right.I believe the problem lies mostly with the 'explanation' stages of this one compared to the last.  Without going into spoilers, the original ""Cube"" didn't, in my estimation, give a single definitive answer, but left the door open.  And in doing so, I felt it suggested something darkly grand, almost infathomable, way outside the realm of previous human experience or, indeed, previously imagined scenarios.  It was so strange and so baffling that it was easy to see why the individual characters had trouble putting their theories into words, and it was a 100% successful attempt at implying new concepts that the human mind is hard pressed to fully grasp.  ""Cube 2 - Hypercube"", on the other hand, is much more forthcoming with explaining the nature of events, and while the revelations may have been much more impressive if this installment had come First, they seem so much less grand and so much more familar than what ""Cube"" hinted at, and rather contrary to what ""Cube"" hinted at.  For this reason, I think you might be better off viewing ""Hypercube"" as a remake that just decides to try out different routes than the original, than as a direct sequel.  Because on its own, ""Hypercube"" is a better movie than it is when viewed as a sequel to ""Cube"".  There are also too many similarities in the behavior patterns of the characters to the first one; enough deviation for a remake but not believable in a sequel that many of the characters would fall neatly into the slots held by some of the previous players.On to the brighter side: though ""Hypercube""'s endstages are less than ""Cube""'s, in the main run of the movie great imagination is on display, throwing new and radically different angles into the mix.  For one thing, this Cube 'does' things that the one in the first didn't.  And the special effects capture all this innovative new territory with great gusto.  Some good twists on character interactions as well, although in other places, as said, a bit too close to the first one.  The bottom line is that this is a very entertaining, very engaging and very well-done movie that shouldn't be missed just because it's off the track from the first one.  Actually, maybe it's better going off track.  With the open-to-interpretation ending of ""Cube"" perhaps the filmakers decided there was really nothing left to say with a linear followup, and opted to try out a different spin on the concept.  Happening in some adjacent reality to the first one, even?

739593,A3AA3OZJPJCDHF,B00008DDVY,Stephen Fink,"[1, 2]","Straight to video sequels that come years after the original are almost never a good sign, but in the case of Cube 2 it just meant the geeks were taking the time to work out all the story's kinks and build a new arena. The result: A hypercube--wherein you take a normal cube and add a theoretical 4th dimension. So impossible to physically create that a place called the &quot;mercury room&quot; is created to somehow transport people there. The story once again revolves around a group of people bumping into each other and trying to discover why they're all there, but this time to a greater end. And how cool is this &quot;hypercube?&quot; Well, since it can't exist in physical space, it can be composed of a virtually infinite number of rooms, all taking place at different times and with different time signatures. So you can go through the door in one room only to run into a character from the past or future in the next one. Or a person in one room could be moving (and thus aging) extremely fast while someone following from the last is left in their dust. Rooms pass through each other and inflict their time on anyone left in their path. So in theory someone could either be aged to death or regressed back to infancy. This makes for some tense scenes and emotional breakdowns between the characters. The only area where Cube 2 lacks is special effects and that may have been easily corrected if the creators ideas didn't go beyond their means. I also have to admit the direction could have been better (and even may have hurt the effects) had a more geeky director had been tapped. Otherwise, though, overall Cube 2 is on par with the original, making up for it's weaknesses in some excellent concept.

I won't go over who's in it or the basic story because that's already covered in so many other reviews. I'll just stick to my general opinions of the movie.First off, it's not a horror movie. I wouldn't even say it's SCI-FI-HORROR. It's pretty much SCI-FI. It's more like a really long episode of ""outer limits"" with ingredients of an x-files episode.Contrary to what I would have believed, there really wasn't a lot of action in this movie. It moved very slowly. I was under the impression that as the group moved between rooms of the cube, each room contained some sort of device or puzzle to get through or else die, but most of the rooms didn't have anything in them!One character makes reference to the first CUBE, saying the first one had ""rules"", but that's pretty much all there is to say about the first one, and then the dude dies. I never learned in the movie what the heck he was talking about. Hopefully I'll figure it out after watching the first one.If you're not a SCI-FI fan, don't even bother, you'll be bored out of your mind and hate it. The power of this movie is that it has you imaging what will happen next, not in what actually happens. But if you don't like to ponder and question things, and would rather have it just straightforward, this movie will not be for you. To say it's deep is an understatement.Another review here compared this series to the phantasm series, but that's WAY OFF. The phantasm series had so much more action and horror then this silly movie.Bottom line, the plot was interesting, and the movie COULD have been cool, but it just fell short. Is there an overall message? If people work together they'll figure it out, but human nature is essentially selfish and was that their undoing? Doesn't matter in the end anyways, as you'll be so unfortunate to see if you sit through the entire thing. Like I said, it's just a really long episode of ""outer limits"". Except ""outer limits"" would probably have been much better.I'm still going to try and rent CUBE because it looks like most people liked that one better anyways.Unless there's NOTHING else to rent, I'd stay away from this one.

739598,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00008DDVY,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","Original &quot;Cube&quot; can boast of its talented Canadian director Vincenzo Natali, who surprised us film fans with its simple but effective rules; solve the mystry of cubic rooms, or you get killed.  Mr. Natali then went on to make another stylish thriller &quot;Cypher&quot; starring Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu (which is far better, wait and see it!), and the sequel is taken over by Andrzei Sekula, who is best known for his works as a cinematographer for &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot;So far, it's ok.  But what is lacking in the sequel (or remake, it seems closer to) is the original's simple rules or logics.  This time you get eight people locked in a cluster of cubic rooms.  They try to figure out how to get out of the place (again, why not), but here's another problem for them.  This newer version, it seems, has eloved into a more sinister one, manipulating even the fourth-dimentional aspect of the space.  But wait, I have a question.  Do you really understand that fourth dimention, which is usually referred to as time?Frankly, I don't know.  To make matters worse, the filmmakers don't know.  So, from the middle of the film, where the new concept is introduced, the story goes awry, not knowing how to get out of the mess gracefully.  The idea of &quot;parallel reality&quot; is at first intriguing, but soon you will realize that they actually don't know what they are doing.  The final solution is a real cop-out, which is little better than a lucky guess.Thanks to the director, the newer &quot;Cube&quot; has more visually interesting sets; the rooms looks clearer with more light, making a good contrast with the former dark ones (so, the cast and crew had to wear sunglasses during the rehearsal, because of too much lighting).  However, the incoherent story damages every visual achievement, and some impressive CGIs.About acting, I only say that it's unfair to accuse the actors who probably signed in this one, not knowing what the film would be.  I find, nevertheless, some of them really, really, embarrasing, and when they are gone, I felt very happy.  Sure, there were some comic moments in the original, but not as  obvious and irritating as Mrs. P. for whose dog I feel sorry.  Strangely Kari Matchett, perhaps the best player in the cast, can also be seen in Natali's &quot;Cypher.&quot;  What made her appear both of them?&quot;Cube -- Hypercube&quot; is not scary, or even thrilling, because it does everything it should not do.  You will be informed about the background of the secret of this deadly &quot;Cube,&quot; which we don't want to know.  You get &quot;love scene,&quot; which we don't need to see.

739599,A3MUSWDCTZINQZ,B00008DDVY,"Ulalume Jones ""Creative Gal""","[12, 17]","I have noticed two people watch the Cube films for different reasons.  Some like special effects, others character development.  If you like psychological horror and films like Blue Velvet or Pi, I would see the first Cube and not the second. If you like trippy special effects and a movie where you don't really have to care about the characters but enjoy the guy from Forever Night finally getting that frenzied vampire feeding his morality would never give on that show, then watch and enjoy.I came into Hypercube knowing that it wasn't going to be as good as the first.  I really can't even watch the end of Cube without freaking out. The rooms are black, the actors [draw] you into a small, paranoid world.  Hypercube is white, like the 180 degree cousin to the first.  I didn't as much as jump or care when the characters were dying.  Well, because everytime one died, another one of them came back. Still, the ideas were interesting. Cube was more of a character film, Hypercube is more of an idea film. But can an idea go on for two hours. I guess it can!I did like a lot of things about it. I liked the wacko old lady. I liked the rooms and the way everything was starting to implode and I liked the floaty sex scene (never mind I saw in on Sci-Fi and didn't get to see any nudity, darn.)  What I didn't like was lack of character motivations.  Were Quinten from Cube and Simon from Hypercube both traps? And I swear the blind girl said one of the same lines that the math knowledgable girl in the first one said, that she doesn't really do anything. That is what bugged me. The lead woman was a lot like the bleeding heart liberal woman in the first one. Two psychos who seem ok at first and then go crazy eights bonkers.  A person with a disability, well two, if you count Granny.  Two young cynical designer guys. Two characters who have cameos, say their piece and die quick, the govt guy in Hypercube and the jail guy in the first one. See what I am getting at?

739600,A5X1B2HBQUR3P,B00008DDVY,"Vikram Ramanathan ""Live to Learn""","[0, 0]","The movie aims to be a scifi horror flick and I think fails  in scoring in either of the genres. The first one was good because it aimed at being a horror flick primarily and was more phsycological. In the first movie ~(cube), the fact that the characters were trapped in a grand maze of cubes and the way the cubes moved and what logic it used was very intelligent. The logic was rooted in mathematics and was understandably explained to the movie goer. In cube 2 there is little explanation of the mechanism of the cubes. The explanation cannot be given because it will prove to be too much for the average movie goer as it would be better understood by physicists with PHD degrees. The internal suspicions between the characters in the cube 1 movie  and the transition of supposed good characters to darker and down right evil ones was done well. Over here in cube 2.0, the group dynamism is not built that well. The concept of the cube is still there in this movie but this time it is more convuluted. It seems the cube is a quantum physics experiment and the cubes are hyper cubes wuth an extra spatial dimention. The cubes also move along time and each cube could be a portal to a parallel universe. Because of this sci-fi core to the film, the film ceases to to be a successor to a cult horror flick franchise that cube 1 promised and tries to be a high concept sci-fi film. And there is no gore, which is ok if the suspense was good and something was there to compensate for the lack of it. Everything is just graphics and green screen. No real horror or scary moments. Also there are no clues to the workings of the cube only a bunch of razel dazzle eye candy and a number which keeps repeating through out the sides of the differnt cube rooms which is later explained to be of a certain significance but was not a surprise. It could have been so much better. Bad execution of extending a good franchise set in motion by cube 1.0 and bad extension of the cube universe. Yet to see cube 0, the prequel to both of these. The bonus features section is ok with a lof of material mostly only on the CGI effects and a detailed exposition of the title sequence.regards, Vikram",2,See it only if you are CUBE franchise fan.,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,2178,"['movie', 'be', 'scifi', 'horror', 'flick', 'think', 'fails', 'scoring', 'genres', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'good', 'aimed', 'being', 'horror', 'flick', 'primarily', 'was', 'more', 'phsycological', 'first', 'movie', '~', 'cube', 'fact', 'characters', 'were', 'trapped', 'grand', 'maze', 'cubes', 'way', 'cubes', 'moved', 'what', 'logic', 'used', 'was', 'very', 'intelligent', 'logic', 'was', 'rooted', 'mathematics', 'was', 'understandably', 'explained', 'movie', 'goer', 'cube', '2', 'little', 'explanation', 'mechanism', 'cubes', 'explanation', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'given', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'average', 'movie', 'goer', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'understood', 'physicists', 'PHD', 'degrees', 'internal', 'suspicions', 'characters', 'cube', '1', 'movie', 'transition', 'supposed', 'good', 'characters', 'darker', 'down', 'right', 'evil', 'ones', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'here', 'cube', '2.0', 'group', 'dynamism', 'not', 'built', 'well', 'concept', 'cube', 'still', 'there', 'movie', 'time', 'more', 'convuluted', 'cube', 'quantum', 'physics', 'experiment', 'cubes', 'are', 'hyper', 'cubes', 'wuth', 'extra', 'spatial', 'dimention', 'cubes', 'also', 'move', 'along', 'time', 'cube', 'could', 'be', 'portal', 'parallel', 'universe', 'sci-fi', 'core', 'film', 'film', 'be', 'successor', 'cult', 'horror', 'flick', 'franchise', '1', 'promised', 'tries', 'be', 'high', 'concept', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'gore', 'ok', 'suspense', 'was', 'good', 'something', 'was', 'there', 'compensate', 'lack', 'Everything', 'just', 'graphics', 'green', 'screen', 'real', 'horror', 'scary', 'moments', 'Also', 'are', 'clues', 'workings', 'cube', 'only', 'bunch', 'razel', 'dazzle', 'eye', 'candy', 'number', 'repeating', 'sides', 'differnt', 'cube', 'rooms', 'later', 'explained', 'be', 'certain', 'significance', 'was', 'not', 'surprise', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Bad', 'execution', 'extending', 'good', 'franchise', 'set', 'motion', 'cube', '1.0', 'bad', 'extension', 'cube', 'universe', 'see', 'cube', '0', 'prequel', 'bonus', 'section', 'ok', 'lof', 'material', 'mostly', 'only', 'CGI', 'effects', 'detailed', 'exposition', 'title', 'sequence.regards', 'Vikram']",N/A

You will mostly find discussions on math, physics, and multiple/parallel dimensions. There are only a few traps that are followed with long pauses where the characters try to figure out everything. And most of the characters are copies from the first Cube, like the guy that goes crazy and kills everyone.The graphics were kind of embarassing to watch, the acting was pretty good, and the ending was a setup for a third cube, but what this movie needed was more traps and more excitement. It even seemed that the characters were bored in this movie at some points!Overall, a pretty good movie. You just have to make yourself get into these mathematical discussions the characters have.

739602,A208I29OP8ZIRP,B00008DDVY,"William J. Irvin ""Mr. Movie""","[1, 3]","Cube 2: Hypercube, wasn't a bad premise. In fact, it was very much in the Twilight Zone vein, which was a great show, indeed. The problem with Cube 2, in my opinion, is that the characters are FAR too polarizing. There isn't much of ANYTHING about any of them which makes one want to LIKE them. Even the sensitive, bleeding heart heroine is quite unlikeable. Just when you want to root for her, because she takes pity on a young, blind girl, she spits out venom with language any self-respecting SAILOR would say. This Jeckyl/Hyde routine kept up throughtout the flick, making her one of my LEAST favorite characters. I was rooting, with all my might, for her to get offed, however it's doubtful that would have mattered, because she probably would have just returned as a 'parallel' character again, anyway! I thought it was incredibly unrealistic the way she easily overpowered the sadistic psycho with his own knife and stabbed him to death. He would have had her for lunch!As for the blind gal, even she isn't very likeable for me. She begins as a cowering, frightened cripple, and I want to take pity on her, but even SHE isn't who she pretends to be. I like her the best, only because I never get a chance to really KNOW her. I believe had I been able to do so, I'd find her as repugnant as the others.The alternately hysterical and coherent old biddy is also a bit much to take. Her early death was a welcome respite for my insulted senses. The young game programmer guy was a loudmouthed little cretin and how UNREALISTIC is it that the party girl in the red dress is a LAWYER!?!? She doesn't talk like a lawyer, nor does she act like a lawyer. In fact, before she mentioned she WAS a lawyer, I'm willing to bet most viewers thought she was a HOOKER!So, why do I give this movie 3 stars, if I think the characters are so unrealistic and repulsive? First off, I like the fact that most of them DIED! It was a sweet bit of silent justice, I felt, for having invested 1-1/2 hours watching and listening to them all! Every one of them had a major attitude problem.Secondly, as I mentioned, I like the premise. People of very different backgrounds stumbling around in a strange place in which no one knew where they were, how they got there or how to escape. It was more of a character study than an action movie.Finally, I felt that Cube 2 was more or less a watered-down version of Cube 1, remade with less gore and violence, so that people with easily offended sensibilities would be able to watch it without turning it off in disgust after 15 minutes.",3,2 Cube by half,1095897600,"09 23, 2004",2004,2558,"['2', 'Hypercube', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'premise', 'fact', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'vein', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'indeed', 'problem', 'Cube', '2', 'opinion', 'characters', 'are', 'FAR', 'too', 'polarizing', ""n't"", 'much', 'ANYTHING', 'one', 'want', 'LIKE', 'Even', 'sensitive', 'bleeding', 'heart', 'heroine', 'quite', 'unlikeable', 'Just', 'when', 'want', 'root', 'pity', 'young', 'blind', 'girl', 'out', 'venom', 'language', 'self-respecting', 'SAILOR', 'would', 'say', 'Jeckyl/Hyde', 'routine', 'kept', 'up', 'flick', 'making', 'one', 'LEAST', 'favorite', 'characters', 'was', 'rooting', 'might', 'get', 'offed', 'however', 'doubtful', 'would', 'have', 'mattered', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'returned', ""'parallel"", 'character', 'again', 'anyway', 'thought', 'was', 'incredibly', 'unrealistic', 'way', 'easily', 'overpowered', 'sadistic', 'psycho', 'own', 'knife', 'stabbed', 'death', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'lunch', 'blind', 'gal', 'even', ""n't"", 'very', 'likeable', 'cowering', 'frightened', 'cripple', 'want', 'take', 'pity', 'even', 'SHE', ""n't"", 'who', 'be', 'best', 'only', 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'really', 'KNOW', 'believe', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'so', ""'d"", 'find', 'as', 'repugnant', 'others.The', 'alternately', 'hysterical', 'coherent', 'old', 'biddy', 'also', 'bit', 'much', 'take', 'early', 'death', 'was', 'welcome', 'respite', 'insulted', 'senses', 'young', 'game', 'programmer', 'guy', 'was', 'loudmouthed', 'little', 'cretin', 'how', 'UNREALISTIC', 'party', 'girl', 'red', 'dress', 'LAWYER', ""n't"", 'talk', 'lawyer', 'act', 'lawyer', 'fact', 'mentioned', 'WAS', 'lawyer', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'most', 'viewers', 'thought', 'was', 'HOOKER', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'give', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'think', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'repulsive', 'First', 'like', 'fact', 'most', 'DIED', 'was', 'sweet', 'bit', 'silent', 'justice', 'felt', 'having', 'invested', '1-1/2', 'hours', 'watching', 'listening', 'Every', 'one', 'had', 'major', 'attitude', 'problem.Secondly', 'mentioned', 'like', 'premise', 'People', 'very', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'stumbling', 'around', 'strange', 'place', 'one', 'knew', 'where', 'were', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'how', 'escape', 'was', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'action', 'movie.Finally', 'felt', 'Cube', '2', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'watered-down', 'version', 'Cube', '1', 'remade', 'less', 'gore', 'violence', 'people', 'easily', 'offended', 'sensibilities', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'turning', 'off', 'disgust', '15', 'minutes']",N/A

It starts as a sequel to Cube, which I found to be suspenseful and at least mildly original. This starts the same way, with a band of strangers thrown together in some kind of sadistic maze. Except for the ""maze"" part, that seems to be a lot of horror movies get going. So, in addition to being a sequel, it's going to need more than originality to get it going, since it has so little.Instead, it has overblown characters: the dotty old lady (with a secret), the nervous blind girl (with a secret), the caring therapist (with a secret), and the guy with a knife (and a secret, or at least a psychotic side). I'll try to avoid spoilers, but this falls into the sequel's common pattern of trying to do more of everything than the original. For example, the original killed off most of its characters. This also kills off most characters, but kills them more.The original had low-budget charm, whether or not it actually had a low budget. This owes more to effects, but keeps some of the original's ambiguity. For one thing it's ambiguous about being a horror film (not horrible enough) or SF flick (not SF-ish enough).
