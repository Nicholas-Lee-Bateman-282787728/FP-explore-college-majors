She's mad as hell that her jewels are missing plus carries a whole laundry list of other sins against her which she is back to square once and for all.  The atmosphere is as tantalizing as its stars with shadowy, noirish, baroqueness. I don't know why these two were never paired together again.  They had great onscreen chemistry.

830589,A3GQKB1KF0CRPE,B0002CR03G,"Deborah MacGillivray ""Author,""","[37, 39]","Chances are you have missed this devilish delightful gem and that is a shame.  With Tommy Lee Jones being one of the best actors around, I was sorry this film is totally ignored.  I think the few that saw it was not entirely sure what to make of it.  For those who have found it, they generally adore this quirky, sexy thriller, a who dun it, who stole the jewels, and if half the cast are alive or not!Tommy Lee Jones gives a great performance (when does he not) as Eddie Mallard.  Eddie is a down-on-his-lucky, so-so gumshoe in the Sam Spade tradition.  When a friend wants to be a client with the tale he wants Eddie to persuade his ex-wife Rachel Carlyle (sexy Virginia Madsen) to leave him alone, Eddie says yes.  All in a days business.  Well, problems soon become apparent that is ""ex"" wife was not an ""ex"" because his friend divorced her, but rather he killed her and then stole all her jewelry.  When this fact comes to light, Eddie's client insists he still wants Eddie to convince Rachel to go away.  Befuddled by his friends insistence he wants the dead woman to leave him alone, Eddie thinks, what the heck, easy money, eh?  However, Rachel soon turns up and she hardly looks like a ghost.  She is a very sexy bombshell.  Soon Eddie is drawn into Rachel's web and into an affair.It's done with a ton of symbolism that requires the viewer to watch this one a dozen times to catch all the little nuances.  The moody atmospheric lensing adds to the teasing, tantalizing feel, with two strong performances by two very amazing actors.  I have always adored Virginia Madsen.  She is the epitome blonde bombshell, yet intelligence radiated, snapping from her eyes challenging you to dare call her a dumb blonde.In one very poignant scene, Madsen and Jones stop before a street singer and asks him to sing a song.  And he says there is only one song.  He signs the most beautiful version of Danny Boy.  I defy anyone not have a tear in their eye after the haunting melody.  The singer ends the song in tears himself, wipes them and says ""Mercy."" saying it just does not get any better than this.That sums up this whole beautiful, quirky film.  Mercy!",5,off-beat film that has so many layers,1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,2155,"['Chances', 'are', 'have', 'missed', 'devilish', 'delightful', 'gem', 'shame', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'was', 'sorry', 'film', 'totally', 'ignored', 'think', 'few', 'saw', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'who', 'have', 'found', 'generally', 'adore', 'quirky', 'sexy', 'thriller', 'who', 'who', 'stole', 'jewels', 'cast', 'are', 'alive', 'not', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'great', 'performance', 'when', 'not', 'Eddie', 'Mallard', 'Eddie', 'down-on-his-lucky', 'so-so', 'gumshoe', 'Sam', 'Spade', 'tradition', 'When', 'friend', 'be', 'client', 'tale', 'Eddie', 'persuade', 'ex-wife', 'Rachel', 'Carlyle', 'sexy', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'leave', 'alone', 'Eddie', 'yes', 'days', 'business', 'Well', 'problems', 'soon', 'become', 'apparent', 'ex', 'wife', 'was', 'not', 'ex', 'friend', 'divorced', 'rather', 'killed', 'then', 'stole', 'jewelry', 'When', 'fact', 'light', 'Eddie', 'client', 'still', 'Eddie', 'convince', 'Rachel', 'go', 'away', 'Befuddled', 'friends', 'insistence', 'dead', 'woman', 'leave', 'alone', 'Eddie', 'what', 'heck', 'easy', 'money', 'eh', 'However', 'Rachel', 'soon', 'up', 'hardly', 'ghost', 'very', 'sexy', 'bombshell', 'Soon', 'Eddie', 'drawn', 'Rachel', 'web', 'affair.It', 'done', 'ton', 'symbolism', 'viewer', 'watch', 'one', 'dozen', 'times', 'catch', 'little', 'nuances', 'moody', 'atmospheric', 'lensing', 'teasing', 'tantalizing', 'feel', 'two', 'strong', 'performances', 'two', 'very', 'amazing', 'actors', 'have', 'always', 'adored', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'epitome', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'yet', 'intelligence', 'radiated', 'snapping', 'eyes', 'challenging', 'dare', 'call', 'dumb', 'blonde.In', 'one', 'very', 'poignant', 'scene', 'Madsen', 'Jones', 'stop', 'street', 'singer', 'sing', 'song', 'only', 'one', 'song', 'signs', 'most', 'beautiful', 'version', 'Danny', 'Boy', 'defy', 'anyone', 'not', 'have', 'tear', 'eye', 'haunting', 'melody', 'singer', 'song', 'tears', 'Mercy', 'saying', 'just', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'this.That', 'sums', 'up', 'whole', 'beautiful', 'quirky', 'film', 'Mercy']",N/A
830590,A3A66MBY6K0O9E,B0002CR03G,"H. Jackson ""docostrow""","[1, 2]","To anyone who is a fan of ghost stories, I have to say this one is particularly well done.  It certainly ranks as one of my all time favorite filmic treatments of the genre. It is done with rare humor, but at the same time gives one a feeling of 1940's style film noir.  It could have been filmed in black and white and still been very effective in promoting that dark, mysterious atmosphere.Tommy Lee Jones portrayal of seedy private eye Eddie Mallard is one of his best performances in my opinion. He is at first understandably condescending to the rich client who wants him to follow his dead wife.  After all, he is desperately in need of what he views as ""easy money"".  It becomes and engrossing portrait of a man gradually coming to realize he has fallen hopelessly in love with a phantom.  Virginia Madsen, in another marvelously suited role for her, is at once sexy and mysterious, while, at the same time showing us a vulnerable side.  She also depicts the venal side of the spirit in a most remarkable fashion.  Great characterization is a hallmark of this film, both in the writing and acting, and the rendition of ""Danny Boy"", sung by a street musician, is the most hauntingly beautiful version of that old song I have ever heard.  It actually brought tears to my eyes!  In fact, all of the music in this film is near perfect in its suitability to the story.  I wish there were a soundtrack available on CD.  It is that good.Do yourself a favor and buy or rent this little known film.  I do not think you will regret it.",5,"Rates  ""Classic"" status",1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,1532,"['anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'ghost', 'stories', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'certainly', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'filmic', 'treatments', 'genre', 'done', 'rare', 'humor', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'feeling', '1940', 'style', 'film', 'noir', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'still', 'been', 'very', 'effective', 'promoting', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'atmosphere.Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'portrayal', 'seedy', 'private', 'eye', 'Eddie', 'Mallard', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'opinion', 'first', 'understandably', 'condescending', 'rich', 'client', 'who', 'follow', 'dead', 'wife', 'desperately', 'need', 'what', 'easy', 'money', 'engrossing', 'portrait', 'man', 'gradually', 'coming', 'realize', 'fallen', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'phantom', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'marvelously', 'suited', 'role', 'once', 'sexy', 'mysterious', 'same', 'time', 'showing', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'also', 'venal', 'side', 'spirit', 'most', 'remarkable', 'fashion', 'Great', 'characterization', 'hallmark', 'film', 'writing', 'acting', 'rendition', 'Danny', 'Boy', 'sung', 'street', 'musician', 'most', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'version', 'old', 'song', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'actually', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'fact', 'music', 'film', 'perfect', 'suitability', 'story', 'wish', 'were', 'soundtrack', 'available', 'CD', 'good.Do', 'favor', 'buy', 'rent', 'little', 'known', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'will', 'regret']",N/A

Most people that review it negatively seem to miss that it is intended to mix genres and spoof the genres in the mix. Give these fine actors some credit.

The scene where the ghost of Jones' grandfather appears to him is ineffably touching.There is something intriguingly ""menage a trois""-ish about the relationship between Jones, his former girlfriend and his writer friend.

""R.B.""","[2, 5]","I'm not sure how I missed 'Gotham' [1988] when it came out in the late 80's, except for, well, it was still the 80's after all...I found this by accident and enjoyed watching it late one night. I can't agree more with the other comments/reviews already listed praising this film.I have two suggestions though...one you can do nothing about and one you can.The format is full-screen, and there are many instances during the film when it's painfully obvious that a wide-screen format would add immensely to the atmosphere and mood. There's not much you can do about that though until a widescreen format is released, if ever. What you can do, is turn your TV's 'Color' off, or desaturate the color, and add a little 'Contrast', to enjoy this film in B/W.Fonvielle's 'The Mummy' [1999] DVD is also a fun-filled thrill not to be missed and 'Cherry 2000' [1987] DVD has Melanie Griffith in her finest form [maybe ever!].
