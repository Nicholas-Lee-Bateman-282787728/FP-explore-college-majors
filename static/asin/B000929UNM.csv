899761,A2R9NG5SF8MWQT,B000929UNM,Hephzibah,"[1, 1]","This DVD is NOT, nor was it designed to be, a seamless copy of Riverdance - The Show.  It is a documentary covering the history of Riverdance from the initial dance done at a competition through the first 10 years of the vastly expanded Riverdance - The Show, and is narrated by Jean Butler (the first lead female dancer).  Every dance and musical interlude is included, even the added dances.  Several different lead dancers are shown.  The DVD isn't a pure documentary, however, because it has editorial comment.  I do not know, of course, if the editorial comment was scripted or was Jean Butler's personal view.I came away believing several things.  First, Riverdance was a very special creation, groundbreaking in many ways and worthy of its fame.  Second, it was/is a mistake to have multiple troupes with varied abilities.  There are some singers and dancers who are definitely not the caliber of the first troupe.  The bell-like purity of voice of the first female lead singer simply has been lost in some later renditions, and several male dancers' high kicks are a travesty compared to, say, Michael Flatley's.Which brings me to the male lead dancers.  I have the video tape of the original Dublin performance (I wish it currently was available as a USA-compatible DVD).  Here was the man who danced that first Riverdance performance, who was the chief choreographer for the expanded Riverdance - The Show, and who was the lead dancer.  He danced with a joy that was special and unique; he was uplifted by the ovations.  He is the man who holds the Guinness World Record for taps in one second.  His high kicks are phenomenal.  His ability was at a whole level not attained by the other male lead dancers in the DVD, who (if the DVD title is to be believed) are the best dancers.  Don't get me wrong:  they are very good - or even excellent - dancers; however, compared to Michael Flatley they are second string.  Further, in some instances the expression on their faces (especially the one that replaced Michael Flatley) was more ""I showed you"" than exuberant joy over the dance itself.I confess I don't like the pas de deux that was added to The Show.  It is a lovely pas de deux - don't get me wrong - but just doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the dances.  The Irish, Flamenco, and American-tap dances (and the Russian folk-style number) all have a certain ""feel"" that is totally different from (and disrupted by) the pas de deux.I am glad I purchased the DVD.  I'd never seen even a clip of the original dance performed at that international venue; it was great to see the origins of this wonderful show.  It was also great to see Michael and Jean react to the ovation at that performance:  it is hard to imagine now, with the show a world-wide phenomenon, that this was the first time a huge audience gave a standing ovation to ""Irish clog dancing"" - so it is hard to grasp the amazement and joy they felt.  Also, I finally heard the meaning of each dance, which was not explained on the video of the Dublin performance.  Jean Butler's explanations are clear and concise, and allowed me to watch each segment at a deeper level, starting to understand the meaning while still appreciating the beauty, art, hard work, and talent.As a documentary - which is what it is - I recommend it.",4,The Best Of - a Documentary,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,3305,"['DVD', 'NOT', 'was', 'designed', 'be', 'seamless', 'copy', 'Riverdance', 'Show', 'documentary', 'covering', 'history', 'Riverdance', 'initial', 'dance', 'done', 'competition', 'first', '10', 'years', 'vastly', 'expanded', 'Riverdance', 'Show', 'narrated', 'Jean', 'Butler', 'first', 'lead', 'female', 'dancer', 'dance', 'musical', 'interlude', 'included', 'even', 'added', 'dances', 'Several', 'different', 'lead', 'dancers', 'are', 'shown', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'pure', 'documentary', 'however', 'editorial', 'comment', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'course', 'editorial', 'comment', 'was', 'scripted', 'was', 'Jean', 'Butler', 'personal', 'view.I', 'came', 'away', 'believing', 'several', 'things', 'First', 'Riverdance', 'was', 'very', 'special', 'creation', 'groundbreaking', 'many', 'ways', 'worthy', 'fame', 'Second', 'was/is', 'mistake', 'have', 'multiple', 'troupes', 'varied', 'abilities', 'are', 'singers', 'dancers', 'who', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'caliber', 'first', 'troupe', 'bell-like', 'purity', 'voice', 'first', 'female', 'lead', 'singer', 'simply', 'been', 'lost', 'later', 'renditions', 'several', 'male', 'dancers', 'high', 'kicks', 'are', 'travesty', 'compared', 'say', 'Michael', ""Flatley's.Which"", 'male', 'lead', 'dancers', 'have', 'video', 'tape', 'original', 'Dublin', 'performance', 'wish', 'currently', 'was', 'available', 'USA-compatible', 'DVD', 'Here', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'danced', 'first', 'Riverdance', 'performance', 'who', 'was', 'chief', 'choreographer', 'expanded', 'Riverdance', 'Show', 'who', 'was', 'lead', 'dancer', 'danced', 'joy', 'was', 'special', 'unique', 'was', 'uplifted', 'ovations', 'man', 'who', 'Guinness', 'World', 'Record', 'taps', 'one', 'second', 'high', 'kicks', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'ability', 'was', 'whole', 'level', 'not', 'attained', 'other', 'male', 'lead', 'dancers', 'DVD', 'who', 'DVD', 'title', 'be', 'believed', 'are', 'best', 'dancers', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'excellent', 'dancers', 'however', 'compared', 'Michael', 'Flatley', 'are', 'second', 'string', 'Further', 'instances', 'expression', 'especially', 'one', 'replaced', 'Michael', 'Flatley', 'was', 'more', 'showed', 'exuberant', 'joy', 'dance', 'itself.I', 'confess', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'pas', 'de', 'deux', 'was', 'added', 'Show', 'lovely', 'pas', 'deux', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'rest', 'dances', 'Irish', 'Flamenco', 'American-tap', 'dances', 'Russian', 'folk-style', 'number', 'have', 'certain', 'feel', 'totally', 'different', 'disrupted', 'pas', 'deux.I', 'am', 'glad', 'purchased', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'even', 'clip', 'original', 'dance', 'performed', 'international', 'venue', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'origins', 'wonderful', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'Michael', 'Jean', 'react', 'ovation', 'performance', 'hard', 'imagine', 'now', 'show', 'world-wide', 'phenomenon', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'huge', 'audience', 'gave', 'standing', 'ovation', 'Irish', 'clog', 'dancing', 'hard', 'grasp', 'amazement', 'joy', 'felt', 'Also', 'finally', 'heard', 'meaning', 'dance', 'was', 'not', 'explained', 'video', 'Dublin', 'performance', 'Jean', 'Butler', 'explanations', 'are', 'clear', 'concise', 'allowed', 'watch', 'segment', 'deeper', 'level', 'starting', 'understand', 'meaning', 'still', 'appreciating', 'beauty', 'art', 'hard', 'work', 'talent.As', 'documentary', 'what', 'recommend']",N/A

I learned that yes, indeed, Michael Flatley for all his brilliance on the dance floor, has an ego the size of the Titanic (and may have the same fate some day--ah but I digress).

I rather liked a couple of the segments where the same number was featured from different shows with different dancers, jumping back and forth between them.  Nice comparisons.  The bonus features were very well done.  I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I do, but I have no regrets whatsoever at having bought it.",5,Better than I expected.,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,718,"['probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'adding', 'anything', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'here', 'wanted', 'add', '*****', 'vote', 'day', 'ever', 'original', 'Riverdance', 'out', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'absolutely', 'buy', 'meantime', 'delightful', 'entertaining', 'disc', 'will', 'hold', 'over', 'very', 'nicely', 'are', 'numbers', 'here', 'featuring', 'Michael', 'Flatley', 'more', 'expected', 'actually', 'rather', 'liked', 'couple', 'segments', 'where', 'same', 'number', 'was', 'featured', 'different', 'shows', 'different', 'dancers', 'jumping', 'back', 'forth', 'Nice', 'comparisons', 'bonus', 'features', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'have', 'regrets', 'whatsoever', 'having', 'bought']",N/A

Riverdance to be appreciated must be an experience that engulfs you in the sweep of music and dance,which cannot be felt with a series of chopped up dance and music segments, that do not flow from one into the other,building in magnitude and intensity. It is like a flower, you can dissect it and find out what it is made  of, but in so doing you lose forever its intrinsic beauty. It really is too bad they didn't just reissue one of the original Riverdanceperformances with Jean Butler and Michael Flatley dancing the leads, so people could actually experience the real show..",2,Don't waste your money get a real old VHS version of one of original shows!,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,652,"['wanted', 'version', 'Riverdance', 'DVD', 'NOT', 'unfortunately', 'Riverdance', 'be', 'appreciated', 'must', 'be', 'experience', 'sweep', 'music', 'dance', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'felt', 'series', 'chopped', 'dance', 'music', 'segments', 'do', 'not', 'flow', 'one', 'other', 'building', 'magnitude', 'intensity', 'flower', 'can', 'dissect', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'made', 'so', 'doing', 'lose', 'forever', 'intrinsic', 'beauty', 'really', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'reissue', 'one', 'original', 'Riverdanceperformances', 'Jean', 'Butler', 'Michael', 'Flatley', 'dancing', 'leads', 'people', 'could', 'actually', 'experience', 'real', 'show..']",N/A

I know it would sell!  We still watch it on VHS, but the problem of course with VHS is the quality of the picture degrades over time.  Truth be told some of the vocal numbers in the original, (I just skip over as they are somewhat boring to watch, which of course would be easier to do on DVD).  But what I LOVE about the original version that this and other released version of the Irish Dance are horrible at is, the camera angles, the lighting, the fact that you get to see the original show in it's entirety and realize that the show was NOT all about Micheal Flatley!  It was the whole cast.  And constantly change camera angles & scenes on the original like they were filming an annoying MTV Music Video.  In the Original VHS, you get to *FOCUS* on a wide view the dancers and to see it as if you were in the audience instead of constant multi-camera views/angles etc!!!  And the lighting is very simple, which it should be, so as not to detract from THE DANCE or the DANCERS!!!!  If you want to see the most terrible lighting in your life, check out Lord of the Dance.  We saw this show when it was touring, and I have to say it's like light-VOMIT!  M. Flatley had an AWFUL eye for that in my opinion.  Much of the time, the lights are staring AT the AUDIENCE and/or the CAMERAS!!!!  The lighting should ONLY LIGHT what YOU, the Audience, is there to WATCH!!!  Also, with Riverdance - The Show, there is no *STUPID FOG* on stage or anything else to detract from what you are trying to watch (again, the DANCING).Anyway, back to this DVD.  It is yet another disappointment.  Stupid cuts, poor lighting & fog, etc.The only DVD on Riverdance that I can recommend at the time of this writing, is the Documentary on the original show that was released by original producers.  It's called ""Riverdance  - A Journey""  It features Moya Doherty (I love to hear her SPEAK!!!), and others telling the story of Riverdance, and was fun to watch the controversy with M. Flatley getting himself kicked off the show due to his over-inflated ego and refusing to re-sign his contract.  Anway, this DVD used to be able to buy that DVD on their website, but I just checked and now even that version is only available on VHS??!!!  I am sure you can get a DVD copy of this however as I own one, and it's probably on sale on Ebay.Moya, PLEASE PLEASE release ""Riverdance - The Show"" on DVD.

I was not disappointed.  It is a great show and a great DVD.  Performance was one of the greatest dance troups that I ever viewed.  It was a very uplifting and a real feel good show.  It  was well thought out and choregraphed.  Each dance was woven into the overall meaning of the word ""Riverdance"" and the contribution that it made to that production.  You are not only entertained but you actually learn something about History.  The music is very inspiring and easily to get your blood flowing.  I highly recommend it.
