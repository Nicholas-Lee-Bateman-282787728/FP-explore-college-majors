I enjoy all three of these movies so it worked out great.Independence Day is a 1990's movie about an alien invasion to earth near the 4th of July. Most of the actors are recognizable and overall it is a great movie. For those of you who have no seen it, it is on nearly every 4th of July, running round the clock.Jumper is an early 2000 movie about a kid who runs away and grows up on his own after he realizes he is able to teleport around the world. He must then escape from the Government agents who recognize the certain few who have this ability.Lastly, i,Robot stars Will Smith who plays a detective who does not trust robots in Chicago in about the year 2050. He must investigate the murder of a man who helped him out earlier in his life.Overall, all three are good movies and it is cheaper to buy them as a set than individually. They do come in their own cases inside a paper sleeve.",5,Great Pack of Movies!,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,980,"['was', 'looking', 'movie', 'Independence', 'Day', 'happened', 'find', 'pack', 'three', 'enjoy', 'three', 'movies', 'worked', 'out', 'great.Independence', 'Day', '1990', 'movie', 'alien', 'invasion', 'earth', '4th', 'July', 'Most', 'actors', 'are', 'recognizable', 'overall', 'great', 'movie', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'nearly', '4th', 'July', 'running', 'round', 'clock.Jumper', 'early', '2000', 'movie', 'kid', 'who', 'away', 'up', 'own', 'able', 'teleport', 'world', 'must', 'then', 'escape', 'Government', 'agents', 'who', 'recognize', 'certain', 'few', 'who', 'have', 'ability.Lastly', 'i', 'Robot', 'stars', 'Will', 'Smith', 'who', 'detective', 'who', 'not', 'trust', 'robots', 'Chicago', 'year', '2050', 'must', 'investigate', 'murder', 'man', 'who', 'helped', 'out', 'earlier', 'life.Overall', 'three', 'are', 'good', 'movies', 'cheaper', 'buy', 'set', 'individually', 'do', 'come', 'own', 'cases', 'paper', 'sleeve']",N/A
