1398217,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B004EI2NU4,Amazon Customer,"[7, 9]","This movie was great!  In short, a group of kids go mountain climbing/hiking in the Balkans.  Along the way, they, not surprisingly, get hunted, and the story revolves around how well they either evade capture or deal with their adversary (trying to avoid spoiler).  Again, it was great.  First of all, the camera work of the beginning 1/2 of the film as they hike/mountain climb was outstanding.  I'm sure there was a lot of computer graphics, but it never felt that way. Its conceivable they actually did the stunts themselves.  Either way, the shots are great, and the tension as they do challenging moves it outstanding.  For fans of mountain climbing and advanced hiking, these scenes alone are worth the ride.  Then we get to the adversarial part.  While this movie is a French analogue of the all too repeated West Virginia mutant gone bad story, it doesn't feel formulaic or tired.  Perhaps there isn't that much new in this story compared to the genre of deep woods hikers meets crazy killer, but it feels fresh.  Hard to articulate why, but it was really enjoyable.

1398218,A2PMQH87R1H3QU,B004EI2NU4,Benjamin Kidman,"[1, 3]",Strange movie. In a world where most films are re-makes of re-makes a little strangness is welcome. Apparently in Europe there are established trails up steep cliffs which allow amatuers to climb in places where you would think only real pros could venture. In the US we probably have too many lawyers to allow such things. This plot contrivance is felicitous. It allows us to watch unskilled climbers get into tricky situations. Normally only real experts and athletes are seen in climbing films. But no matter how bad it looks Stalone can be expected to get out of any situation. Here however these aren't action stars hanging off that cliff they are just everyday people with whom one can identify - much more suspenseful. The film has some loose ends and an bizarre change of direction half way through. It's never completely clear where the plot is going - I liked that.,4,NICE LITTLE SUSPENSE/THRILLER FROM FRANCE!!,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,875,"['Strange', 'movie', 'world', 'where', 'most', 'films', 'are', 're-makes', 're-makes', 'little', 'strangness', 'welcome', 'Apparently', 'Europe', 'are', 'established', 'trails', 'up', 'steep', 'cliffs', 'allow', 'amatuers', 'climb', 'places', 'where', 'would', 'think', 'only', 'real', 'pros', 'could', 'venture', 'US', 'probably', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'lawyers', 'allow', 'such', 'things', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'felicitous', 'watch', 'unskilled', 'climbers', 'get', 'tricky', 'situations', 'Normally', 'only', 'real', 'experts', 'athletes', 'are', 'seen', 'climbing', 'films', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'Stalone', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'get', 'situation', 'Here', 'however', 'are', ""n't"", 'action', 'stars', 'hanging', 'off', 'cliff', 'are', 'just', 'everyday', 'people', 'whom', 'one', 'can', 'identify', 'much', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'loose', 'ends', 'bizarre', 'change', 'direction', 'half', 'way', 'never', 'completely', 'clear', 'where', 'plot', 'going', 'liked']",High Lane

1398221,A1N37L78ZREG8Y,B004EI2NU4,Carolyn Paetow,"[1, 2]","When this movie concerns the perils of mountain climbing, it ascends to near excellence.  The character infos are concise and pertinent, and the action gets quickly under way.  There's plenty of vertiginous suspense, heart-pounding hazards, and sudden, gasp-inducing scares.  But then the film descends into the abyss of slasher flickdom with its latest carnation of back-country, degenerate, slicer-dicer killer.  The canny and deliberate characters shed about 30 IQ points apiece and become silly, screaming ninnies who run blindly through the dark, heedless of booby traps, precipices, and brutal, sadistic slayer.  A non-French speaker scarcely needs subtitles as most of the dialogue devolves into little more than squalling and name-shrieking.  The imperiled rapellers sink rapidly into petty squabbling and sexual competition, and fists sometimes fly with all the abandon of a 50's TV Western.Unfortunately, this film's climax comes early on, and it's--ahem--all downhill from there.  Rescue scenes are over-edited, robbing the viewer of catharsis, and yet tedious displays of indecision and timidity go on and on.  But the blood is, of course, boundless.  And, apparently, so is the slasher, since the film's ending blurbs that over 3000 people have disappeared in the Balkans wilds!",2,The Low Road,1318377600,"10 12, 2011",2011,1291,"['When', 'movie', 'perils', 'mountain', 'climbing', 'near', 'excellence', 'character', 'infos', 'are', 'concise', 'pertinent', 'action', 'quickly', 'way', 'plenty', 'vertiginous', 'suspense', 'heart-pounding', 'hazards', 'sudden', 'gasp-inducing', 'scares', 'then', 'film', 'abyss', 'slasher', 'flickdom', 'latest', 'carnation', 'back-country', 'degenerate', 'slicer-dicer', 'killer', 'canny', 'deliberate', 'characters', 'shed', '30', 'IQ', 'points', 'apiece', 'become', 'silly', 'screaming', 'ninnies', 'who', 'run', 'blindly', 'dark', 'heedless', 'booby', 'traps', 'precipices', 'brutal', 'sadistic', 'slayer', 'non-French', 'speaker', 'scarcely', 'subtitles', 'most', 'dialogue', 'little', 'more', 'squalling', 'name-shrieking', 'imperiled', 'rapellers', 'sink', 'rapidly', 'petty', 'squabbling', 'sexual', 'competition', 'fists', 'sometimes', 'fly', 'abandon', '50', 'TV', 'Western.Unfortunately', 'film', 'climax', 'early', 'ahem', 'downhill', 'there', 'Rescue', 'scenes', 'are', 'over-edited', 'robbing', 'viewer', 'catharsis', 'yet', 'tedious', 'displays', 'indecision', 'timidity', 'go', 'blood', 'course', 'boundless', 'apparently', 'so', 'slasher', 'film', 'ending', 'blurbs', '3000', 'people', 'have', 'disappeared', 'Balkans', 'wilds']",High Lane
1398222,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B004EI2NU4,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 1]","High Lane (original title: Vertige) tries to pack the action and thrills of two different horror films into one.  The first half of the film is a true winner, especially effective for those of us with a deathly fear of heights; the second half isn't bad, either, with its liberal dose of gore and a splash or two of victims behaving badly, but it's definitely a step down from all that has come before.  The real bad guy of the film is rather generic and boring, but the film makes up for this somewhat by the villainy that sometimes emerges from characters we are supposed to be rooting for - and I think that's a nice touch indeed.  Just when you start thinking a certain character isn't a complete douche after all, he proves you wrong.So, five friends decide to do some rock climbing and aerial sightseeing in the Croatian mountains.  Actually, it's two couples plus a former boyfriend of one of the girls (who somehow managed to invite himself along for the trip).  The presence of her ex Guillaume doesn't seem to bother Chloe (Fanny Valette) too much, but current boyfriend Loic clearly isn't happy about it at all.  Heck, Chloe's the only reason he's here to risk his life climbing mountains to begin with, and now this ex-boyfriend shows up and puts him to shame in every way possible (heck, Loic even makes me look like a manly man).  Now, Fred and Karine (Maud Wyler) are all about the adventure.  Given the fact that they are French, they are incredibly brave.  While most people with half a brain would turn back when they see that the trail is closed, Fred talks everyone into climbing a sheer rock face and doing what they came to do.  It turns out that the trail was closed for a reason, so the group has quite an adventure on their hands.  Prepare for a great mix of beautiful scenery (but it's not Croatian, as the movie was filmed in the French Alps) and harrowing action shots that will have my fellow acrophobics squirming in their seats.  If High Lane had just stuck to this nothing-but-a-rope-between-you-and-a-big-sharp-rock-thousands-of-feet-below premise, it could well have been an incredibly intense and effective thriller - unfortunately, the story morphs completely at the mid-way point into just another Wrong Turn copy-cat, leaving most of the chills and thrills behind.  Yes, the special effects and the gore are well-done, but the villain is bland and the action far too generic.  The only suspense or surprise comes when a character does something really stupid or downright vindictive.  I liked the ending, though, as it did at least show a tiny bit of originality.The first half of High Lane is A-level work, but the second half deserves several comments in red ink.  It's unfortunate because everything (except the dubbing) was going so well.  There is also the matter of Chloe's flashbacks to a traumatic event in her life, which only works to a certain degree and could (perhaps should) have been removed from the plot, but I can live with that.  High Lane isn't all it could have been, but it's still an impressive and sometimes quite thrilling horror offering from director Abel Ferry.  I hear that Fanny Valette is a real up-and-coming actress in Europe, as well.",4,"You'll love the first half, but the second half disappoints",1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,3206,"['High', 'Lane', 'original', 'title', 'Vertige', 'pack', 'action', 'thrills', 'two', 'different', 'horror', 'films', 'one', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'true', 'winner', 'especially', 'effective', 'deathly', 'fear', 'heights', 'second', 'half', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'liberal', 'dose', 'gore', 'splash', 'two', 'victims', 'behaving', 'badly', 'definitely', 'step', 'down', 'come', 'before', 'real', 'bad', 'guy', 'film', 'rather', 'generic', 'boring', 'film', 'up', 'somewhat', 'villainy', 'sometimes', 'characters', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'rooting', 'think', 'nice', 'touch', 'indeed', 'Just', 'when', 'start', 'thinking', 'certain', 'character', ""n't"", 'complete', 'douche', 'wrong.So', 'five', 'friends', 'decide', 'do', 'rock', 'climbing', 'aerial', 'sightseeing', 'Croatian', 'mountains', 'Actually', 'two', 'couples', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'one', 'girls', 'who', 'somehow', 'managed', 'invite', 'trip', 'presence', 'ex', 'Guillaume', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bother', 'Chloe', 'Fanny', 'Valette', 'too', 'much', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'Loic', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'happy', 'Heck', 'Chloe', 'only', 'reason', 'here', 'risk', 'life', 'climbing', 'mountains', 'begin', 'now', 'ex-boyfriend', 'up', 'shame', 'way', 'possible', 'heck', 'Loic', 'even', 'look', 'manly', 'man', 'Now', 'Fred', 'Karine', 'Maud', 'Wyler', 'are', 'adventure', 'Given', 'fact', 'are', 'French', 'are', 'incredibly', 'brave', 'most', 'people', 'brain', 'would', 'turn', 'back', 'when', 'see', 'trail', 'closed', 'Fred', 'everyone', 'climbing', 'sheer', 'rock', 'face', 'doing', 'what', 'came', 'do', 'out', 'trail', 'was', 'closed', 'reason', 'group', 'quite', 'adventure', 'hands', 'Prepare', 'great', 'mix', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'not', 'Croatian', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'French', 'Alps', 'harrowing', 'action', 'shots', 'will', 'have', 'fellow', 'acrophobics', 'squirming', 'seats', 'High', 'Lane', 'had', 'just', 'stuck', 'nothing-but-a-rope-between-you-and-a-big-sharp-rock-thousands-of-feet-below', 'premise', 'could', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'incredibly', 'intense', 'effective', 'thriller', 'unfortunately', 'story', 'morphs', 'completely', 'mid-way', 'point', 'just', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'copy-cat', 'leaving', 'most', 'chills', 'thrills', 'Yes', 'special', 'effects', 'gore', 'are', 'well-done', 'villain', 'bland', 'action', 'far', 'too', 'generic', 'only', 'suspense', 'surprise', 'when', 'character', 'something', 'really', 'stupid', 'downright', 'vindictive', 'liked', 'ending', 'though', 'did', 'least', 'show', 'tiny', 'bit', 'originality.The', 'first', 'half', 'High', 'Lane', 'A-level', 'work', 'second', 'half', 'several', 'comments', 'red', 'ink', 'unfortunate', 'everything', 'dubbing', 'was', 'going', 'so', 'well', 'also', 'matter', 'Chloe', 'flashbacks', 'traumatic', 'event', 'life', 'only', 'certain', 'degree', 'could', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'plot', 'can', 'live', 'High', 'Lane', ""n't"", 'all', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'still', 'impressive', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'thrilling', 'horror', 'offering', 'director', 'Abel', 'Ferry', 'hear', 'Fanny', 'Valette', 'real', 'up-and-coming', 'actress', 'Europe', 'as', 'well']",High Lane

1398225,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B004EI2NU4,Haunted Flower,"[8, 9]","""High Lane"" was directed by Abel Ferry and stars Fanny Valette (Chlo&eacute;), Johan Lib&eacute;reau (Loc), Raphal Lenglet (Guillaume), Nicolas Giraud (Fred), and Maud Wyler (Karine) as a group of friends (two couples and a fifth wheel) who decide to go mountain climbing on a mountain closed for repairs and end up getting hunted by a deranged killer.The climbers see that the pass is closed but go anyway, a classic beginning to a nature horror movie where nature enthusiasts bite off more than they can chew. It seems like it will be easy going since this mountain is equipped for safe climbing complete with ladder rungs wedged deep into the mountain and steel safety cords to hook onto. Everyone is wearing safety harnesses with double lanyard hooks so this should be simple, right?The first setback besides the pass being closed is that Loc clearly has a fear of heights combined with vertigo that he is attempting to hide from the group to keep his pride intact in front of his girlfriend, Chlo&eacute;'s ex, Guilliaume who is still in love with her. The action begins fast and one accident after another occurs until it becomes clear these are not just accidents and someone is out to get these hikers.I already have a pretty established fear of heights so watching even the ""fun"" portions of their trip was enough to tie my stomach in knots. The movie gets more intense as every worse case scenario begins to enfold on them. The tension between the ex-boyfriend and the new boyfriend is heated up by the stress of trying to find a way out despite losing group members. It is a shorter film, only one hour and twenty minutes so there is no wasted screen time dwelling on talking about feelings or back story when the situation is so much more dire than that.

But we also get a hillbilly mutant that lives way out in the middle of nowhere and kills off mountain climbers. The acting feels very wooden and stupid, but part of that is probably because of the usual voice overs that just make the emotions of the actors seem that way. It's about as good as people can possibly do with voice overs. It's not as laughable as it was in those 70's Kung Fu films, and not as bad as it was in the German made film about Junkies called 'Christiane F.', but it's still sometimes laughably odd. In the end this was not a good idea for a horror film. It felt very familiar and ultimately was a pretty dumb movie. It's your typical 80's style slasher fare with some hill climbing thrown in in an attempt to do something different.

At that point, this is a very simple man vs. nature plot, in which Fred (&lt;em>Taken&lt;/em>'s Nicolas Giraud), a climber who also seems to be one of those go-go-go self-help gurus, and his girlfriend Karine (&lt;em>Low Life&lt;/em>'s Maud Wyler) take a trio of others for a climb on what, Fred tells us enthusiastically, is the highest, longest (read: most grueling) climb in Europe. We're told it's somewhere in Croatia, though I can't remember where for the life of me (it has been noted on the IMDB discussion boards that it is, in fact, an agglomeration of at least two different climb sites). You know this is going to go wrong when they see a sign saying in no uncertain terms the site is closed for repairs and Fred ignores it. Just to add to the doomy feeling is the fact that our other trio is all full of scary baggage: Karine's friend Chloe (&lt;em>La Petite Jerusalem&lt;/em>'s Fanny Valette) is a doctor who just had something nasty happen to her at work, though what it was is only gradually revealed throughout the film. Along with her is old boyfriend Guillaume (&lt;em>Les Bleus&lt;/em>' Raphael Lenglet), pretty much the epitome of the ruggedly-handsome athletic type, and geeky new boyfriend Loic (&lt;em>Cold Showers&lt;/em>' Johan Libereau), who's pretty much the opposite. This is a movie that, given that premise, needs not one more thing other than good acting and a competent director to make it gripping.And for those first thirty minutes, that's exactly what you get, as Loic overestimates his endurance (and underestimates his fear of heights), the group encounter increasingly dangerous situations while thousands of feet in the air, and things in general spiral out of control.Then you hit the half-hour mark, and the movie becomes, in essence, &lt;em>The Ascent&lt;/em> with a strong flavor of &lt;em>Deliverance&lt;/em>. At which point you know pretty much everything that's going to happen and stop caring about any of it. Okay, you probably can't predict some of the more idiotic character choices, but, you know.Okay, maybe it's not that bad. (Yes, it is, but I'll play devil's advocate for a minute.) You've seen &lt;em>The Descent&lt;/em>, you've seen &lt;em>Wrong Turn&lt;/em>, you've seen &lt;em>The Hills Have Eyes&lt;/em> (hopefully the original and not the hideous remake), you've seen &lt;em>Deliverance&lt;/em>, you've seen a dozen or two other films like this, and if you've been following my reviews for at least a few years you've hopefully seen a smattering of really, really good French horror flicks while avoiding their bad ones. And then you come to &lt;em>Vertige&lt;/em> and... well, I won't blame you if you actually do watch it, because that first half-hour is something else. But once you get to the point where the movie turns from man vs. nature thriller into dumb slasher flick, you'll start wondering, since you've seen all those other movies, why you're watching this, which is as cavalier in its borrowing from other movies as it is in its blending of climb sites.

Its nothing too original..its similar to a lot of other films like Wrong Turn, Decent, Deliverance, The Hills Have Eyes, but for what it was, it was pretty good. This one is about a group of hikers/climbers that get detoured and become hunted down by a killer. But if you're looking for a high body count or lots of blood/gore/violence, there isn't a ton here, thought there is some more violent sequences towards the end. It takes a while for the plot to get going, but the cinematography is great, and there is some suspenseful moments early on.  In fact, the film could have easily been an adventure film by itself, without the added horror storyline. As far as the acting, it was decent. The version I watched was dubbed in English, and I didn't have the option to watch it in the original language with subtitles. I usually don't like dubbed films because the voice acting isn't always great, but even the dubbing on this one wasn't bad. If I'm going to be picky, I thought the makeup on the killer could have been better. He really just looked like a dirty, homeless guy. And I was sorta expecting a Wrong Turn type group of people, rather than just one killer. But again, that's being picky.

Hoppock""","[1, 1]","&#8220;High Lane&#8221; is a French horror movie made in 2009 about five people who go hiking/mountain climbing in the mountains of Croatia.  I am not certain if the movie was indeed shot and filmed in Croatia, but the scenery was quite breath taking.  I guess this is a good of time as any to say the dubbing in the film isn&#8217;t that bad, not great, but not bad.  Anyway, out of the five folks involved, two of them are a guy and a gal who are in charge of the exhibition (so to speak) and are a couple.  The other three are another girl and two guys, but never fear there is a good recipe for a love triangle.  I will leave it at that.This move is about eighty minutes long and the first forty minutes are of our five friends hiking and climbing.  There are a couple of really intense scenes involving people almost falling, climbing cables snapping and a moment with a high walking bridge, that needs to be seen to be believed.  I am not sure if the actors and actresses did their own stunts or not, but the performances were impressive.Once we hit the forty minute mark, give or take a few minutes, the movie goes downhill extremely fast.  This is mainly due to the fact that this movie turns into a lousy &#8220;Wrong Turn&#8221;-ish slasher movie.  Let the record show, I am a hard core silly fan of slasher movies, when done right.  The &#8220;Wrong Turn&#8221; films are sort of lame, in my humble opinion.  Nevertheless, the killer looks like a young Tom Petty with rabies; this in itself is a riot.  So a movie that has some potential ends up being a run of the mill crap-fest, but I suppose if one is not looking for much it might be fun.
