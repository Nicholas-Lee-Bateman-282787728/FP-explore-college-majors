1333005,A1LPT1NB3TSMDG,B0038QIYVA,Amazon Customer,"[2, 7]","I found the opening song to be pleasant and caught myself sort of humming it a bit, and I rarely hum or sing. The animation is beautiful, nothing to complain about. The art however does not suit my tastes, the characters' eyes seemed too far apart, I would have paid a lot of money just to go up to my screen and push all the females' eyes just a little closer together. However, I do think the school uniform design is the cutest school uniform I have ever seen in an anime. Also when Misuzu spreads out her arms and has her hair flowing in the wind, as though she is flying, she does look angelic.This anime is based off of a video game, I have never watched an anime based off a video game that has not bored me (not to say good ones aren't out there I just haven't found them). So why did I watch this series? It received a lot of positive attention with articles from various anime magazines that I read. That combined with the fact that it was only 13 episodes made me give it a try, and I regret it. I gritted my teeth and finished this series simply because I had wasted money on it. Not a single episode felt slightly interesting until episode 8 and even then my interest was short lived. The story moved very slowly at first and the whole first story arc felt like fillers, then the main purpose of the anime began to show and then BAM!! an UTTER crap ending. The show became very confusing at the end, they never paused to properly explain much and very weird things were happening. Even if things were explained I doubt it would redeem my opinion of this anime. The only good scenes in this entire show were ones with the dog Potato in them, he made me smile.I'm actually ANGRY at this anime because underneath how bad this show is I could tell there was a story that had the potential to really move me. However, this isn't to say there aren't others out there who don't love this show. In fact when people ask for a ""short and sad"" anime I often frown and then mutter that they might like Air...even though I didn't...and the funny thing is they end up loving it. This is one show I really disliked and I believe I might be in the minority in my dislike for this show.",1,This series felt like it was missing something,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,2182,"['found', 'opening', 'song', 'be', 'pleasant', 'caught', 'sort', 'humming', 'bit', 'rarely', 'hum', 'sing', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'nothing', 'complain', 'art', 'however', 'not', 'suit', 'tastes', 'characters', 'eyes', 'seemed', 'too', 'far', 'apart', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'lot', 'money', 'just', 'go', 'up', 'screen', 'push', 'females', 'eyes', 'just', 'little', 'closer', 'together', 'However', 'do', 'think', 'school', 'uniform', 'design', 'cutest', 'school', 'uniform', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'anime', 'Also', 'when', 'Misuzu', 'out', 'arms', 'hair', 'flowing', 'wind', 'flying', 'look', 'angelic.This', 'anime', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'anime', 'based', 'off', 'video', 'game', 'not', 'bored', 'not', 'say', 'good', 'ones', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'why', 'did', 'watch', 'series', 'received', 'lot', 'positive', 'attention', 'articles', 'various', 'anime', 'magazines', 'read', 'combined', 'fact', 'was', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'made', 'give', 'try', 'regret', 'gritted', 'teeth', 'finished', 'series', 'simply', 'had', 'wasted', 'money', 'Not', 'single', 'episode', 'felt', 'slightly', 'interesting', 'episode', '8', 'even', 'then', 'interest', 'was', 'short', 'lived', 'story', 'moved', 'very', 'slowly', 'first', 'whole', 'first', 'story', 'arc', 'felt', 'fillers', 'then', 'main', 'purpose', 'anime', 'began', 'show', 'then', 'BAM', 'UTTER', 'crap', 'ending', 'show', 'became', 'very', 'confusing', 'end', 'never', 'paused', 'properly', 'explain', 'much', 'very', 'weird', 'things', 'were', 'happening', 'Even', 'things', 'were', 'explained', 'doubt', 'would', 'redeem', 'opinion', 'anime', 'only', 'good', 'scenes', 'entire', 'show', 'were', 'ones', 'dog', 'Potato', 'made', 'smile.I', ""'m"", 'actually', 'ANGRY', 'anime', 'underneath', 'how', 'bad', 'show', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'story', 'had', 'potential', 'really', 'move', 'However', ""n't"", 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'others', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'show', 'fact', 'when', 'people', 'ask', 'short', 'sad', 'anime', 'often', 'frown', 'then', 'mutter', 'might', 'like', 'Air', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'funny', 'thing', 'end', 'up', 'loving', 'one', 'show', 'really', 'disliked', 'believe', 'might', 'be', 'minority', 'dislike', 'show']",N/A

1333008,A2AOUHBZ1HXO5D,B0038QIYVA,Avantel,"[1, 1]","This show ""Air"" is a true piece of art. It starts with a typical linear plot and a bit of fantasy and ends up becoming quite testing. The main issue seems to be a confusing or non-clear story as it moves on, but the real turn off for most people could be something unique by dealing with an untested domain of failure.Yes, maybe the core of this series deals with a problem, isolation/alienation or incapacity to bond with other people. This is widespread everywhere, nonetheless the American entertainment industry usually fails to portray or approach realistically. Japanese anime deals with it more often, yet still struggles with the challenge of reflecting it well. ""Air"" is the best approach to alienation that I've ever seen and therefore the one that has impressed me the most in all my life.This show's portrait of alienation surely uses much fantasy, but its drama and circumstances well make up for that lack of realism. This could be the saddest anime drama that I have seen (maybe 80 or so). The drama gets as deep as in classic movies like ""Doctor Shivago"" The central heroine, Misuzu Kamio, beats Lara Antipova from my viewpoint.  Besides, the fantasy is well deployed because it's used to display a surreal atmosphere rather than the typical average situation of superheroes, superpowers, fights and more overused routines. Even the few fights in the show yield quite unexpected outcomes while keeping the art. The animation and soundtrack are also first rate as well as the English-voice actors, and I normally prefer to listen in their original language. I even bought the CD soundtrack. It seems the base of these qualities are Japanese values, like sharp elegance or work ethic shown every possible way, such as house chores.This series will make you understand why the Japanese cannot believe that Americans enjoy anime. One big reason is that they normally watch what is already very similar to Hollywood's stuff.

Up until I saw this beautiful series, I had thought Angel Beats! was the saddest, most heartbreaking anime I had ever seen, but Air was much more heart-rending than Angel Beats!The story centres around lonely, sickly teenager Misuzu Kamio, who is gorgeous and cute, but has no friends, and is a bit strange, to say the least. She meets and befriends wanderer Yukito Kunisaki, who is wary of her at first, but warms to her quickly. As he is homeless, she invites him home for a meal and a bed for the night. However, her foster mother Haruko Kamio (who it turns out is actually her aunt), who is a bit of a chaotic character (regularly crashing her motorbike), and drinks a lot, isn't keen on him. But, they muddle along, and various other characters join the plot. Sisters Kano and Hijiri Kirishima, plus cute dog Potato (who for some reason, doesn't bark, but says 'Pico, pico!' all the time), join the fray, along with beautiful Minagi Tohno, and the mysterious Michiru. I won't go into details, beyond saying the story is absolutely heartbreaking; I never cried so much in my life. I was left bereft for days after finishing watching the series; even now just thinking about it still chokes me up. If you are looking for something light-hearted and easily forgotten, don't watch this; if it doesn't break your heart, you must be already dead!The Amazon description is wrong in that it says the aspect ratio is 4:3; it isn't, it is 16:9.

1333018,A1GW690RCZE0WL,B0038QIYVA,Draconis March,"[5, 5]","It's impossible to miss the signature style of Key/Visual Arts:  Great character devlopment, awesome emotional involvement, stunning visuals, heart-touching, tear-jerking, amazing music, and lovable protagonists.The characters are relatable, believable, and sympathetic.  The characters don't get handed the idiot ball (even though there were plenty of chances for it to occur) and do stupid things that make you want to bang your face against the wall; no, their actions/reactions are realistic.  What I'm talking about is that some writers in series make characters behave like total retards just to make a plot point work.  And that doesn't happen here.  I can't remember any times that there was something incredibly to obvious to me, as the viewer, that they SHOULD have been doing that they were doing the OPPOSITE of.The animation, as already stated, is beautiful.  The scenary creates feelings of pure bliss--especially the sky.  It's obvious that they put a TON of effort into the blue sky with its white whispy clouds during the day, the orangey hues of dusk, and the starry skies at night.  The sea is also very nice, whenever it's shown.  The characters are also very nice to look at.  Hair (usually Misuzu's) blowing in the wind is especially well done.  The only thing I can complain about is that the male characters' eyes are ""normal"" sized (read: small) when compared to the girls.  If you've seen Kanon, Clannad, or Angel Beats!, you know they like to have all the characters have big eyes.  Oddly enough, the guys seemed to have missed the boat here.  I don't mind big eyes, but if you're going to do them, it'd be better if you were consistent.To give you an idea about how clear and crisp it looks:  Even though it's a DVD, it looks like a blu-ray (at least when both are viewed on an HDTV).  I say this because it looks about as good as my Angel Beats! BD (except for certain special effects-driven scenes that weren't needed in Air), even though its 5 years older.  This could be reversed to say that Kyoto Animation's quality has hardly changed in that much time, but really, when you see it for yourself, it's hard to believe it COULD be any better.The musical score is beautifully appropriate for the themes presented in the series.  Most of them come from the game it's based off of, so they may be familiar to you.  The intro song, ""Tori no Uta,"" does the perfect job setting the tone in the beginning: pure, fantastic bliss.  Insert songs are also light and ""airy"" (ha ha I'm punny), setting the mood for their respective scenes.  If you don't cry to ""Aozora"" during the climax at the end, you'll probably never cry in your life.As you can expect with any classic Key/Visual Arts work, your tear ducts will get a work out (for both the happy and the sad).  It's heart-warming, and heart-breaking.The English VAs are great (especially Haruko and Yukito, IMO).The relationship between Haruko and Misuzu is, I believe, the most relatable, realistic, and touching of them all.  If nothing else, seeing Haruko's character develop--along with their relationship--is a good enough reason to give this series a shot in and of itself.  In hindsight, she is my favorite character:  My heart ached for her and her plight more than anyone else.I would've liked it better if the side stories of the other characters (Kano, Minagi, and Michiru to a lesser extent) were done better (I LOVED Minagi!).  First of all, they were too short.  I feel the series could easily have reached the 24 episode mark if they had expounded more upon these side stories, spent more time on the main story arc, and stuffed the content in the OVA into the main series.  Second of all, once these two characters' arcs are done, they don't appear in the series anymore except for a brief cameo.  Third, it would've been nice to see them tie in somehow with the main story of Michiru.  And lastly, the characters (Kano, Minagi, and Michiru) should've had more time to develop on screen before we focus on them.This is the only thing that hurt the score at all (I rate it 9/10, but since this is Amazon...)tl;dr:  Sad but beautiful and touching.

This is definitely in my top ten anime series and maybe in my top five. This series is rated TV 14 but I am not sure why. I would rate it TV PG. Anyways on to the storyline.The story starts with a boy that travels from town to town named Yukito. He finally arrives at his next destination only to run into the most unusual girl in town named Misuzu. Misuzu ends up inviting Yukito to stay with her and her mom. He does and during his stay with them Yukito encounters many women with problems. He tries his best to help everyone he can in the town and the town grows on him. Mean while he still searches for the person his mom told him about called the lady in the sky (A woman with wings). Yukito believes that woman is in that town. Yukito ends up making many friends and discovering a more beautiful part of life.The ending to this series made a tear run down my cheek and believe me it is not easy to make me tear up. You will experience many feelings when watching this anime and will be able to relate to almost all the characters without difficulty. I would recommend this anime to any anime lover and to someone that is looking for a story that will make their hearts hurt with sadness.

I feel like it's so close to being a great anime, but it just missed the mark by like 1/10th of an inch. It had all the elements of a great story --a lone hero; a damsel in distress; and ancient curse; and magical winged beings of incredible power. The only problem with it was that they put in a lot of stuff that just wasn't pertinent to the main story. It felt like episodes 2-5 were mostly filler material in order to make Yukito into a heroic figure, but they didn't really have to do that. The reason I stick to that is that after the two girls stories were finished, they didn't appear anywhere else in the rest of the show, really. That makes them filler that wasn't necessary.There were some plot points that also bugged me, but I don't want to give away too much. You'll see it if you look. All I can say is that over a thousand years of storing magic in the doll, the best that they could come up with was that? Also, they really didn't make the details of Lady Kana's life fold into the story in any kind of coherent fashion. It seems to me, that if you've been searching for the girl in the sky for over a thousand years, you would have been able to pass on more than just a doll and vague stories. It didn't really make sense to me.Aside from that, there were some real touching moments. I was disheartened by the character's fates, and it showed some really sad moments. If you like to shed a tear, I've no doubt that you will watching this. It's sad in a lot of ways. The animation is great and the English voice cast was excellent.
