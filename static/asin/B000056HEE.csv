Well, they did it when Sinclair Lewis' novel Elmer Gantry was adapted for the screen. In it, one will see Burt Lancaster to give the performance of his career. There is not a better one in other films he had done. This is a different league for him. Sometimes, throughout Elmer Gantry, I think he is as comparable as Marlon Brando. Another superlative performance is Jean Simmons' who provides a counterbalancing force against the fiery Burt Lancaster. In the middle of the two is the well recognized investigative reporter from Lawrence of Arabia played by Arthur Kennedy who provides a cynical perspective and tries to make sense out of the Revivalism. There are many outstanding scenes, but that fire scene is damn impressive. All in all, Elmer Gantry runs for two and half hours, and it's one of the quickest and most thrilling two and half hours I've sat through, thanks to Burt Lancaster's Oscar winning performance.",5,You Are All Sinners!

569323,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000056HEE,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","I dedicate this movie to all the regulars on Yahoo Answers Religion & Spirituality category.  Burt Lancaster is Gantry, a failed ""drummer"" salesman, and Jean Simmons is Sister Sharon Falconer, a comparatively innocent revivalist.Lest you think this is only fiction, it is a fact that religious revivals in large tents were a major source of entertainment in small town America when I was a child, and as far as I know still are in the Bible-belt south. You could go to the revival to flirt with the boys when your parents did not let you go to drive-in movies. It got you out of the house on hot summer nights.Gantry sees the potential for financial gain much more cynically than does Sister Sharon, although she's pretty slick at persuading the town's preachers to sponsor her tent revival for the good of their own parish funds. The thing that comes through crystal clear is that hypocrisy and sincere religious fervor played out a war in her heart, as in the hearts of those local preachers. People who make their living doing something which is understood to be completely non-commercial, who need to consider the practical without ever acknowledging it, develop the fine art of hypocrisy to the point where they can successfully deceive themselves as well as those in front of them.But Gantry has more than money in mind: he has the trim young body of Sister Sharon in mind, as well, although she is sufficiently good at self-deception to avoid this factor for some time.I won't spoil it for you by detailing the ups and downs of this emotionally crippled couple. Suffice it to say if you want to understand better what the war is about on Religion & Spirituality, if you want to try to fathom the minds of the fundamentalists, you need this movie and/or the book from which it is drawn, as essential background material.",4,Sinclair Lewis Wrote the Book; the Movie Takes the Center Third of It,1337558400,"05 21, 2012",2012,1826,"['dedicate', 'movie', 'regulars', 'Yahoo', 'Answers', 'Religion', 'Spirituality', 'category', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Gantry', 'failed', 'drummer', 'salesman', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Sister', 'Sharon', 'Falconer', 'comparatively', 'innocent', 'revivalist.Lest', 'think', 'only', 'fiction', 'fact', 'religious', 'revivals', 'large', 'tents', 'were', 'major', 'source', 'entertainment', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'still', 'are', 'Bible-belt', 'south', 'could', 'go', 'revival', 'flirt', 'boys', 'when', 'parents', 'did', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'drive-in', 'movies', 'got', 'house', 'hot', 'summer', 'nights.Gantry', 'potential', 'financial', 'gain', 'much', 'more', 'cynically', 'Sister', 'Sharon', 'pretty', 'slick', 'persuading', 'town', 'preachers', 'sponsor', 'tent', 'revival', 'good', 'own', 'parish', 'funds', 'thing', 'crystal', 'clear', 'hypocrisy', 'sincere', 'religious', 'fervor', 'played', 'out', 'war', 'heart', 'hearts', 'local', 'preachers', 'People', 'who', 'make', 'living', 'doing', 'something', 'understood', 'be', 'completely', 'non-commercial', 'who', 'need', 'consider', 'practical', 'ever', 'acknowledging', 'develop', 'fine', 'art', 'hypocrisy', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'successfully', 'deceive', 'as', 'well', 'front', 'them.But', 'Gantry', 'more', 'money', 'mind', 'trim', 'young', 'body', 'Sister', 'Sharon', 'mind', 'as', 'well', 'sufficiently', 'good', 'self-deception', 'avoid', 'factor', 'time.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'detailing', 'ups', 'downs', 'emotionally', 'crippled', 'couple', 'Suffice', 'say', 'want', 'understand', 'better', 'what', 'war', 'Religion', 'Spirituality', 'want', 'try', 'fathom', 'minds', 'fundamentalists', 'need', 'movie', 'book', 'drawn', 'essential', 'material']",N/A
569324,A3Y6GNHCOER58,B000056HEE,Billie Mann,"[9, 9]","""Elmer Gantry"" is an amazing film that does not seem dated at all, having lost none of its bite or appeal with the passing of time. Taken from the classic Sinclair Lewis novel of the same name, director Richard Brooks garnered an Oscar for Best Screenplay for his adaptation, and Burt Lancaster won his sole Best Actor Oscar for his performance as Elmer Gantry. Gantry is an over-the-top opportunistic traveling salesman who teams up with evangelist Sister Sharon Falconer (Jean Simmons) to promote religion in 1920's America. Gantry turns out to be the perfect publicity compliment to Sister Sharon, who, unlike him, is a true believer. Where she is quiet and gentle with her manner of preaching, he is all fire and brimstone, literally throwing himself about the audience and inflaming them into repentance.Burt Lancaster commands the screen: all flashing teeth, athletic energy, charisma, and wild hair, using his own physical prowess to great advantage. The angelic and lovely Jean Simmons, who had legions of adoring male fans when she was in her ethereal prime, portrays Sister Sharon (loosely based on a well-known real-life revivalist of the early 1920's, Aimee Semple McPherson, about whom I'd heard from my grandmother) in a manner reminiscent of her character in ""Spartacus"" - she was the perfect choice for this role, as was Lancaster for his.Shirley Jones was awarded the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her lively portrayal of prostitute Lulu Bains, whose past history with Gantry comes back to haunt him, with some of the best lines in the film - gleefully laughing as she dances about a room full of her fellow prostitutes, she recounts that ""He rammed the fear of God into me so fast I never heard my old man's footsteps!""Watching Burt Lancaster in his prime use his athletic ability (he was a circus acrobat before he became an actor) and physical grace helps make his performance truly electrifying. And he also manages to believably evolve Elmer Gantry from loud-mouthed salesman to a sympathetic and honest human being over the course of the film.The top-notch supporting cast includes Arthur Kennedy, Patti Page, Dean Jagger, and John McIntire.",5,"""You're all sinners!

Summing up, until there, nothing unusual, but he's more than all these, because ordinary people, good or bad, doesn't pretend to make business from religion. Surely they haven't the necessary oratory talent, but Gantry surpass almost all in this, and in defrauding in these peculiar way he's a deliberate, qualified sinner. But perhaps  Gantry isn't so bad. We see: he lies, but his public I think wishes to be deceived and in these strange way, he gives illusion and hope. No doubt the hope and illusion he gives are a fraud  but however he does give these and in life there isn't much of all that. Elmer Gantry puts fire in his words it doesn't matter what these words says -usually nothing- but he has enthusiasm ad that ever has been a scarce quality. We truly don't know what is the Christianism of Gantry; these minuteness are irrelevant for him, but I think defrauding people is paradoxically the way he has to love these people and you know, one of the few things Devil can't do is to love. For that I think Elmer Gantry at last is a good man who has some bad habits, but, who has not some in this life?

569334,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000056HEE,David Baldwin,"[8, 8]","""Elmer Gantry"" has entered the vernacular to be synonymous with charlatan preacher so I approached this film with some preconceived notions.  What impressed me about the film was the complexity of it's characters with all their virtues and failings.  Nobody in this film is initially what they seem from Gantry (Burt Lancaster) to the prostitute from his past(Shirley Jones).  The thing that is most compelling about Gantry is we are kept guessing to the very end to his motives.  The film starts with Gantry as a smooth-talking traveling salesman when opportunity presents itself and he soon finds himself in the tent revival show of Sister Sharon Falconer(Jean Simmons).  Gantry and Falconer present an interesting contrast where he orates fire and brimstone and she preaches more low-key about the virtues of milk and honey.  On the surface one could say that Gantry is a shameless huckster and that Falconer is his patsy, however, the film I think demonstrates that he has faith and that she has some ulterior motives that are more self-serving than spiritual.  The film also contains an agnostic reporter, Lefferts(Arthur Kennedy), who would appear on the surface to be hostile to Sister Sharon's operation but that's not necessarily the case.

Jean Simmons and Shirley Jones were great, too, exactly right as the true believer and the scheming whore, respectively. And to think it almost didn't happen.Writer-director Richard Brooks tried for years to get a studio to back the film, according to the new book ""Tough as Nails: The Life and Films of Richard Brooks"" (available from amazon.com), but no one wanted to touch it. As a young man Brooks had been taken by the Sinclair Lewis novel about a hypocritical preacher, but the novel had been banned from film production by the Hollywood censors as early as the 1930's.Finally, in the late 1950's, with the Production Code crumbling amid controversial but popular movies, Brooks got the go-ahead and made ""Elmer Gantry"" for United Artists, his first movie after leaving MGM. Lancaster had been unmoved by early versions of the script, and Brooks considered other actors before agreeing to work with Lancaster to revise the script. (Names he mentioned included Montgomery Clift and James Cagney.)Brooks didn't want Shirley Jones for the role of the prostitute - she was known as a light musical star - but Lancaster had seen her in a live TV show and thought she could handle the part. Brooks made her feel unwanted, ignoring her the first day she worked, even though it was her big scene in the whorehouse. That night, he called her and admitted she had been great and that he had been wrong. He correctly predicted she'd get an Oscar - as did she, Lancaster and Brooks himself for his screenplay.Don't overlook Jean Simmons, though. She makes the whole movie work as Sister Sharon. By playing Sharon as a true believer - she wasn't the phony that Elmer Gantry was - Simmons makes her being swept away by Gantry all the more tragic. Brooks pushed to prohibit people under 16 from seeing the movie without an adult even though it cost him at the box office. Doing so avoided having the Legion of Decency condemn the movie.

Things like mindless stereotypes--from Bible-thumping Midwestern nimrods to ecclesiastical hypocrites.  (Like we've never seen any of this before?)  Jean Simmons is more convincing as an instructor at a charm school than as an evangelist under a chautauqua tent, while Shirley Jones's soiled dove role is a case study in contrived predictability.  And while we're on the subject of predictability, let's be sure to mention Arthur Kennedy as the skeptical, cynical reporter (truly groundbreaking, I know).But put all of the above aside; I thoroughly enjoyed this 1960 classic because Burt Lancaster is literally larger than life as he romps through every shot with the tenacity of a pit bull.  Lancaster, grinning ear to ear, oozes charming believability, whether he's playing Elmer Gantry the charlatan, Elmer Gantry the hard-drinking womanizer, or Elmer Gantry the fire-and-brimstone condemner of souls.  His energy and vitality, his roguish charm and overconfidence, devour every scene.

Burt Lancaster is outstanding, portraying the Bible-thumping but hard drinking, morally bankrupt Elmer Gantry convincingly and with great fidelity to the protagonist of Sinclair Lewis's novel. The plot itself is reasonably complex and the movie doesn't drag at any point.Plus, the movie raises important questions: Does Gantry really believe what he preaches or is he merely a con man, out to fleece the flock, so to speak? (Much of the time he comes across as eminently sincere, but is this a sign of genuine faith or merely an act? It is hard to say for sure.) What does his success as an evangelistic preacher say about the willingness of people to trust a charismatic individual (Gantry certainly is one of these) on the basis of external appearances alone? Is the fact that Elmer Gantry's past comes back to bite him a sign of cosmic justice, or is it just one of those unfortunate accidents that happens to some but not all who use and abuse other people?The down side of this movie is that most of it focuses on a very small portion of Lewis's book. As a result, those who have read the book may be disappointed that so much of it isn't covered in the movie. Of course, this is one of the problems that comes with turning a book into a movie.

It was one of my all-time favorite movies and after watching it again last night ,it impressed me once again. Since the last time I watched it someting new has taken place; that being Amazon Customer Reviews.In the past,one might read or hear a review of a book or movie if you were lucky,but in a short time it would be hard to find one on anything a couple of years old. I guess there were always sources to find old reviews if you knew where to find them;but this was not accessable to the ""ordinary joe"".Now it's a whole different story. After watching the movie again,I couldn't wait to check out the Customer Reviews. Here I found 39 Reviews.I read every single one,helpful and otherwise. There are all kinds of things in these reviews and coming from Customers of every stripe and color;they are all different and and particularly different from what we got in the past,namely,only Editorial Reviews. Some CR's give a brief summary of the movie,some are written with a personal bias,some add information about Oscars,some give opinions of the meaning the author was attempting to convey,and so forth. I even enjoyed the few that ""slammed"" the movie;because it was interesting to find why someone might dislike such a movie, that was held in such wide high regard. It is hard to pick one review over another,but if you were to read only a few;don't miss the review of Lawrence Bernabo of March 17,2005.I only wish I had the knowledge and skill to write a review like that.I hadn't thought about it;but from reading the reviews,the movie was based on a book written in the 1920's by Sinclair Lewis and the movie is essntially from only one chapter. I couldn't find any CR's on the book; but I'm intending to read it,now that I know about it.If the movie is only one chapter,the whole book must be good.Another thing I learned from the CR's is that the movie is somewhat based on two well known revivalists at the time. My father was a young man in the 1920's and I can remember him mentioning the names of Billy Sunday and Aimee Semple McPherson the personalities some reviewer suggested Elmer Gantry and  Sister Sharon Falconer were based on.No wonder I enjoy this movie so much. There is little doubt that this is a Classic  and is as good to watch today as when it first came out in the 1960's.Not only that,the CR's show what a wonderful resource,we now have at our disposal;but then again; I already knew that.",5,"""The Lord sure moves in mysterious ways.""",1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,2577,"['say', 'great', 'movie', 'understatement', 'many', 'ways.I', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'number', 'times', 'years', 'recently', 'got', 'own', 'copy', 'was', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'watching', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'impressed', 'once', 'again', 'last', 'time', 'watched', 'someting', 'new', 'taken', 'place', 'being', 'Amazon', 'Customer', 'Reviews.In', 'past', 'one', 'might', 'read', 'hear', 'review', 'book', 'movie', 'were', 'lucky', 'short', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'one', 'anything', 'couple', 'years', 'old', 'guess', 'were', 'always', 'sources', 'find', 'old', 'reviews', 'knew', 'where', 'find', 'was', 'not', 'accessable', 'ordinary', 'joe', 'whole', 'different', 'story', 'watching', 'movie', 'again', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'check', 'out', 'Customer', 'Reviews', 'Here', 'found', '39', 'Reviews.I', 'read', 'single', 'one', 'helpful', 'otherwise', 'are', 'kinds', 'things', 'reviews', 'coming', 'Customers', 'stripe', 'color', 'are', 'different', 'particularly', 'different', 'what', 'got', 'past', 'namely', 'only', 'Editorial', 'Reviews', 'CR', 'give', 'brief', 'summary', 'movie', 'are', 'written', 'personal', 'bias', 'add', 'information', 'Oscars', 'give', 'opinions', 'meaning', 'author', 'was', 'attempting', 'convey', 'so', 'forth', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'few', 'slammed', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'find', 'why', 'someone', 'might', 'dislike', 'such', 'movie', 'was', 'held', 'such', 'wide', 'high', 'regard', 'hard', 'pick', 'one', 'review', 'were', 'read', 'only', 'few', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'review', 'Lawrence', 'Bernabo', 'March', '17,2005.I', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'knowledge', 'skill', 'write', 'review', 'that.I', 'had', ""n't"", 'thought', 'reading', 'reviews', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'written', '1920', 'Sinclair', 'Lewis', 'movie', 'essntially', 'only', 'one', 'chapter', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'CR', 'book', ""'m"", 'intending', 'read', 'now', 'know', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'chapter', 'whole', 'book', 'must', 'be', 'good.Another', 'thing', 'learned', 'CR', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'based', 'two', 'well', 'known', 'revivalists', 'time', 'father', 'was', 'young', 'man', '1920', 'can', 'remember', 'mentioning', 'names', 'Billy', 'Sunday', 'Aimee', 'Semple', 'McPherson', 'personalities', 'reviewer', 'suggested', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'Sister', 'Sharon', 'Falconer', 'were', 'based', 'on.No', 'wonder', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'little', 'doubt', 'Classic', 'as', 'good', 'watch', 'today', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', ""1960's.Not"", 'only', 'that', 'CR', 'show', 'what', 'wonderful', 'resource', 'now', 'have', 'disposal', 'then', 'again', 'already', 'knew']",N/A

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[8, 8]","""Elmer Gantry"" has always been one of my favorite films, and it definitely is time to see an upgraded DVD version of this timeless classic.  For this is a movie that I think is timeless and relevant.  The movie, set in a world of tent revivalism, accurately predated many of the scandals we saw in the world of tele-evangelism throughout the eighties, nineties, and present day.  That a film from 1960 could still reflect current trends is absolutely amazing to me.  Every time I sit down to watch ""Elmer Gantry,"" it blows me away.For those who have been cautious about approaching a film based on evangelism, let me assure you that this is glorious entertainment.  Not staid, austere, or preachy--""Elmer Gantry"" is a rare film that reinforces religious conviction at the same time it is subverting the subject.  For on the surface, Gantry is a charlatan and a performer.  The film is an expose of corruption and hypocrisy within the religious community portrayed.  However, his character is counterbalanced by Sister Sharon--a flawed woman of real faith.  At first, you feel her participation makes her complicit in wrongdoing--but eventually you see a raw passion and clear belief emerge.The movie benefits from great performances.  This is the quintessential Burt Lancaster performance, one that won him an Oscar.  Elmer capitalizes on the charm and magnetism that made Lancaster a star, and he is so robust, vital, and alive--it may be the showiest, yet grounded, performance in history.  Shirley Jones also picked up a well deserved Supporting Actress Oscar for her out-of-character role as a prostitute.  Very evil and seemingly having the time of her life, this is a far cry from ""The Partridge Family"" or ""Oklahoma.""  But, for me, the heart and soul of this piece is the overlooked (and always underrated) Jean Simmons.  Her Sister Sharon is a remarkably complex character, one of the most well rounded portraits of a religious leader in film.  Far from a saint, she is ambitious and lustful.  Caught between right and wrong, she is also a devout believer who genuinely wants to spread goodness.  It's a perfectly nuanced role.With an Oscar winning screenplay, as well, this is a pitch perfect examination of faith, duty, loyalty and choice.  It's a powerhouse of emotion--as real and relevant today as it was over 45 years ago.  But more significant, it is absolutely entertaining--it's fast, wildly dramatic, and wickedly funny.  So for whatever reason you may approach ""Elmer Gantry,"" approach it you must.  Not necessarily considered an epic, to me ""Gantry"" is a true classic and epic in every way.

569350,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000056HEE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","I was enamored of this film long before I ever read Sinclair Lewis's novel and discovered that director Richard Brooks was only telling part of the story and that his Elmer Gantry was not a weak hypocrite.  For Brooks the key part of the novel was Gantry's encounter with Sister Sharon Falconer, and that becomes the climax of this 1960 film.  Besides, Lewis freely admitted that his Elmer Gantry was more of a caricature than a real human being, even if most people assumed he modeled Gantry and Falconer on Billy Sunday and Aimee Semple McPherson.  Clearly their fictional counterparts have had an exchange of consciences, but it is the conflict between the showman and the true believer that Brooks found to be most compelling, which explains how one chapter in the middle of the book became this particular movie.We begin with the novel and the description of a holiday spent in a saloon where salesman Elmer Gantry is regaling the boys with jokes and stories.  When a group of Salvation Army sisters come in trying to raise money for the unfortunate, Gantry is able to enthrall the collection of drunks enough to get them to contribute.  Gantry had studied to be a preacher once upon a time, but then was forced to leave the seminary.  Now it seems the spirit is once again upon him.  Although he is able to walk into a black church and make himself right at home, he has a harder time trying to become part of the traveling revival company of Sister Sharon Falconer (Jean Simmons).  Falconer is resistant to his charm, but falls for his personal story of how in a moment of despair in a hotel room he opened up a drawer and found a Gideon Bible.While Gantry preaches hellfire and damnation, Sister Sharon depicts heaven as a land of milk.  He keeps urging her to go to Zenith to see if their act can play the big time, but she is resistant.  Her right-hand man, William L. Morgan (Dean Jagger), the m has his doubts as well, but in the end the thought of all those souls needing to be saved and her dream of being able to build a tabernacle and no longer have to work out of a tent proves too much of a temptation.  In the big city Gantry knows how to grease the wheels, which means how to manipulate the businessman George F. Babbitt (Edward Andrews), but there are two major obstacles.The first is the reporter Jim Lefferts (Arthur Kennedy), who is basically H.L. Mencken with charm and manners.  His pointed critique of Falconer's credentials comes across as reasonable and I think one of the film's best moments is when Sister Sharon finds the perfect words to make even the most famous agnostic in America get on his knee.  The second is Lulu Barnes (Shirley Jones), a prostitute in Zenith who knew Gantry back in his seminary days.  When her pimp sees the opportunity to extort money from Gantry by revealing their past, Lulu sees a chance to extract personal revenge (another memorable moment in the film comes when Gantry has occasion to ask the pimp, ""Don't you know that hurts?).  How these obstacles are overcome sets up the climax of the film, where redemption becomes a prelude to first an apparent miracle, and then a disaster literally beyond belief.There is pretty much universal agreement that the part was perfect for Lancaster, where he had the charisma he displayed in ""The Crimson Pirate,"" but with maturity and restraint that had his power crackling off the screen.  The film provided Lancaster and Jones with far and away the best roles of their careers and each received well-deserved Oscars for their performance, as did Brooks for his adapted screenplay.  For that matter, I think this is Simmons' finest performance and a case can be made for what Kennedy and Jagger turn in as well.  The film was nominated for Best Picture, but lost out to ""The Apartment,"" and Andr&eacute; Previn's dramatic score was the film's other nomination.Granted, the debate over which characterization of Elmer Gantry is more realistic, or more rhetorically potent, the one in the novel or the one in the film, is well worth having.  The big question is whether Gantry is ultimately first and foremost a salesman or a conman, that is to say, whether he enjoys making the sale or in reaping the profits.  In between the time that ""Elmer Gantry"" was released we have had Jim and Tammy Bakker, Jimmy Swaggart, and other scandals in the evangelical community, so it may seem that the film is somewhat prescient in its depictions, but then the hypocrites have been around almost as long as the poor that we always have with us.  Besides, in this film, Brooks certainly depicts the power of faith and the need for people to believe as well as the shallowness of some of those in the pulpit.",5,"""Love is the morning and the evening star""",1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,4695,"['was', 'enamored', 'film', 'long', 'ever', 'read', 'Sinclair', 'Lewis', 'novel', 'discovered', 'director', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'was', 'only', 'telling', 'part', 'story', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'was', 'not', 'weak', 'hypocrite', 'Brooks', 'key', 'part', 'novel', 'was', 'Gantry', 'encounter', 'Sister', 'Sharon', 'Falconer', 'climax', '1960', 'film', 'Lewis', 'freely', 'admitted', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'was', 'more', 'caricature', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'even', 'most', 'people', 'assumed', 'modeled', 'Gantry', 'Falconer', 'Billy', 'Sunday', 'Aimee', 'Semple', 'McPherson', 'Clearly', 'fictional', 'counterparts', 'have', 'had', 'exchange', 'consciences', 'conflict', 'showman', 'true', 'believer', 'Brooks', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'compelling', 'how', 'one', 'chapter', 'middle', 'book', 'became', 'particular', 'movie.We', 'begin', 'novel', 'description', 'holiday', 'spent', 'saloon', 'where', 'salesman', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'regaling', 'boys', 'jokes', 'stories', 'When', 'group', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'sisters', 'come', 'trying', 'raise', 'money', 'unfortunate', 'Gantry', 'able', 'enthrall', 'collection', 'drunks', 'enough', 'get', 'contribute', 'Gantry', 'had', 'studied', 'be', 'preacher', 'once', 'time', 'then', 'was', 'forced', 'leave', 'seminary', 'Now', 'spirit', 'once', 'again', 'able', 'walk', 'black', 'church', 'make', 'right', 'home', 'harder', 'time', 'trying', 'become', 'part', 'traveling', 'revival', 'company', 'Sister', 'Sharon', 'Falconer', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Falconer', 'resistant', 'charm', 'personal', 'story', 'how', 'moment', 'despair', 'hotel', 'room', 'opened', 'up', 'drawer', 'found', 'Gideon', 'Bible.While', 'Gantry', 'preaches', 'hellfire', 'damnation', 'Sister', 'Sharon', 'heaven', 'land', 'milk', 'urging', 'go', 'Zenith', 'see', 'act', 'can', 'play', 'big', 'time', 'resistant', 'right-hand', 'man', 'William', 'L.', 'Morgan', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'm', 'doubts', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'thought', 'souls', 'needing', 'be', 'saved', 'dream', 'being', 'able', 'build', 'tabernacle', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'work', 'out', 'tent', 'too', 'much', 'temptation', 'big', 'city', 'Gantry', 'how', 'grease', 'wheels', 'how', 'manipulate', 'businessman', 'George', 'F.', 'Babbitt', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'obstacles.The', 'first', 'reporter', 'Jim', 'Lefferts', 'Arthur', 'Kennedy', 'who', 'basically', 'H.L', 'Mencken', 'charm', 'manners', 'pointed', 'critique', 'Falconer', 'credentials', 'reasonable', 'think', 'one', 'film', 'best', 'moments', 'when', 'Sister', 'Sharon', 'perfect', 'words', 'make', 'even', 'most', 'famous', 'agnostic', 'America', 'get', 'knee', 'second', 'Lulu', 'Barnes', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'prostitute', 'Zenith', 'who', 'knew', 'Gantry', 'back', 'seminary', 'days', 'When', 'pimp', 'opportunity', 'extort', 'money', 'Gantry', 'revealing', 'past', 'Lulu', 'chance', 'extract', 'personal', 'revenge', 'memorable', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'Gantry', 'occasion', 'ask', 'pimp', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'hurts', 'How', 'obstacles', 'are', 'overcome', 'sets', 'up', 'climax', 'film', 'where', 'redemption', 'prelude', 'first', 'apparent', 'miracle', 'then', 'disaster', 'literally', 'belief.There', 'pretty', 'much', 'universal', 'agreement', 'part', 'was', 'perfect', 'Lancaster', 'where', 'had', 'charisma', 'displayed', 'Crimson', 'Pirate', 'maturity', 'restraint', 'had', 'power', 'crackling', 'off', 'screen', 'film', 'provided', 'Lancaster', 'Jones', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'roles', 'careers', 'received', 'well-deserved', 'Oscars', 'performance', 'did', 'Brooks', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'matter', 'think', 'Simmons', 'finest', 'performance', 'case', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'what', 'Kennedy', 'Jagger', 'turn', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'lost', 'out', 'Apartment', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Previn', 'dramatic', 'score', 'was', 'film', 'other', 'nomination.Granted', 'debate', 'characterization', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'more', 'realistic', 'more', 'rhetorically', 'potent', 'one', 'novel', 'one', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'having', 'big', 'question', 'Gantry', 'ultimately', 'first', 'foremost', 'salesman', 'conman', 'say', 'making', 'sale', 'reaping', 'profits', 'time', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'was', 'released', 'have', 'had', 'Jim', 'Tammy', 'Bakker', 'Jimmy', 'Swaggart', 'other', 'scandals', 'evangelical', 'community', 'may', 'seem', 'film', 'somewhat', 'prescient', 'depictions', 'then', 'hypocrites', 'have', 'been', 'around', 'almost', 'as', 'long', 'poor', 'always', 'have', 'Besides', 'film', 'Brooks', 'certainly', 'power', 'faith', 'need', 'people', 'believe', 'as', 'well', 'shallowness', 'pulpit']",N/A

Gantry, as played by a brilliant Burt Lancaster, may be a hypocrite in that he does not practice what he preaches, but there is no doubt in my mind that he genuinely believes. This makes him a complex character for we are not altogether sure what his motives are. When he joins Sister Sharon's evangelical crusade it is unclear whether he does it because he is attracted to her, because he hopes to make money, or whether along with these motives he really wishes to spread the word.The characters in this film have all the failings of human beings. Jean Simmons, acting the part of Sister Sharon, makes her seem almost like a saint. In the end she comes to resemble Joan of Arc. However, her image of purity is mixed with other factors. She has ambition and she has desire. This mixture makes her a rounded and interesting character. It would have been easy to make a film where Gantry and Sharon were mere charlatans, but then we would not care about them. Instead the film presents a complex but ultimately sympathetic view of faith. Even Arthur Kennedy's sceptical newspaperman admits that he wishes he could believe. Gantry may have many faults but he is a good man. He is kind to the prostitute, played by Shirley Jones, even after she has tried to destroy him. Thus, despite his lapses, he shows the strength and the quality of his faith.The print used for this DVD is presented in its original ratio, it is clear and has very little apparent damage.

However I will add my ""ditto"" to his remarks and maybe add a few of my own.I stayed away from seeing this film because ""Elmer Gantry"" had become the label for huckster/evangelist.  I'd seen enough evangelists in my time to appreciate the good that they give as well as their faults, so I was loathe to see another one-sided, negative portral of Christian fundamentalism.So I was relieved as well as very happilly suprised to see a brilliant picture of a well-rounded human being, one with obvious failings but also with obvious virtues.  I haven't read sinclair Lewis' novel on which the script was based so I can't compare it.I read somewhere that William Holden was considered for the role and while I think he would have been good, I can't imagine anyone better in it than  Burt Lancaster.  Lancaster's tremendous physicality and inherent charm bring deep pleasure to the character.  One senses that, although he had his hard times, that he really loved life and had a great time being in his own skin. His innate joy, be it sourced from his religious beliefs or from sheer nature, is wonderfully entertaining to see.  One can see how such a man, if he ever existed, would be a magnet not just for the ladies, but for the adoration of the many people who were attracted to him and his message.It's this joy that I carried away with me from watching the film.  However there's more to the film than this.  The film  shows us a point in the history of our country when religious revivals swept the country.  It was before my time but I recall hearing my father, who grew up in the midwest, refer to Billy Sunday and even Aimee Semple Macpherson.  Our family didn't belong to a fundamentalist religion but even so, there was a note of respect in his voice when he mentioned them, certainly nothing of scorn.The characters are people who are caught in the ethos of that day.  Times obviously were hard and people needed something to hang on to.  The appeal of the tent show, which seems awfully primitive to our eyes, was real to them.  Gantry was a good looking, charismatic guy who made a living as a travelling salesman, and obviously made the best of what life had dealt him.  He was the kind of saleman Willie Lohman would have loved to be---people in seven states knew him by his first name!  He always had time for a game of cards with the locals, a joke for the store owners, and a good time for the ladies.It wasn't an easy life, though, and when some hobos he met riding the rails stole his shoes, he hobbled barefoot into town and was ripe for the charms of a beautiful lady evangelist and all that she  had to offer.What is so wonderful about the story is how all of the characters are shown as whole people.  Gantry, to some who don't seem to see very far into the character, is just a hypocrite, a guy who drinks, womanizes and then charms the ignorant of their money.  I don't see him that way.  I don't think he could have gotten as far as he did with by lying.  Sister Sharon Falconer was not stupid and she would have dismissed him if that's all there was to him.I'll leave it to others to judge the characters as they will.  I just want to recommend the film and to ask viewers to suspend their prejudices, for or against religion, to see this as a human drama, beautifully told.Lancaster is definitely the star of the show.  Jean Simmons is adequate as the female preacher but I think she lacks the power and fire that such a character would have had to have.  She played a similar character, a Salvation Army preacher in ""Guys and Dolls"" with more success.  Shirley Jones is beautiful but lacks the bad-girl vibe to carry off her role successfully.  Patti Page, who was a big star at the time, has a surprisingly  small role, as a timid choir leader.

569360,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,B000056HEE,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[0, 0]","This is a spectacular movie which focuses on the early evangelical movement in the United Sates. Some critics think it is crudely based on the lives of evangelists, Aimee Semple McPherson and Billy Sunday, but it is based on a novel by Sinclair Lewis (1927) which caused a public furor. His book was banned in Boston and other cities, and clergy denounced from pulpits across the country. He wrote this book after his research at several churches in Kansas City. The theme of the movie is corruption and fraud perpetrated in the name of God, but there are no foul words, no nakedness, no illicit sex or alcohol among church members, but there is greed and ambition.Burt Lancaster, as the lead character Elmer Gantry, offers a brilliant performance that is captivating: Some critics said that he was born to do this role. Sometimes he acts like a crazy  drunk, a flamboyant salesman, a womanizer, a penniless drifter who cons others for his own enjoyment. We see Gantry as a disillusioned and misguided middle aged human being with no particular aim in life. While travelling in the Midwest, he comes across the public prayer meeting of evangelist, Sharon Falconer (Jean Simmons). Sister Sharon is the leading preacher of a new movement, a kind of revival of faith movement, or evangelism, or church without walls. She is very feminine, tender, and vulnerable and yet she can put her foot down when she has to make firm decisions about her preaching or her style of spreading the message of God. She is on a fast track to make to the top as the messenger of God, and it is then Gantry meets her and cons her into believing that he is a man of God and he can help her movement. Sharon is hesitant and her right-hand man, William Morgan (Dean Jagger) expresses his displeasure especially when he finds about the shadowy past of Elmer Gantry. But Gantry squirms his way into the movement as the new leading man; he impresses Sharon Falconer with his style of preaching. Soon he will be making deals with crooked men and gamblers.Jean Simmons offers a great performance as Sharon Falconer, but she is strongly overshadowed by the brilliance of Burt Lancaster who won the Academy award in the best actor category in 1960 beating a heavy weight like Spenser Tracy (Inherit the wind), another movie about Biblical teachings.Gantry sees his end coming when his past catches up with him. His involvement with a young woman named Lulu Bains (Shirley Jones) becomes scandalous and his reputation and the movement is discredited, but when the air clears and later Lulu claims that she framed Elmer, the movement gains its strength again, but it is too late for Sharon Falconer when the church catches fire . It is at end of the movie, we see humanity in all its beauty, love and forgiveness in the spirit of Biblical teachings.The rest of the cast is also superb. Patti Page is poignant as Sister Rachel, who leads the choir of the ministry, and falls in love with Gantry, but in vain, her voice is never heard, since he is more focused on expanding the ministry and building the coffers of the movement. Jean Simmons does her best to speak with a Midwestern accent, since Falconer is supposed to be from Kansas. Shirley Jones as Lulu Bains is beautiful and seductive was also honored with an Academy award in the best supporting actress category. My favorite moment in the movie is when Gantry enters a black church, barefoot, filthy, with two suit cases in his hands (after a fight with drifters on goods-train). Then he joins the startled congregation in singing the prayer; ""I am on my way, Glory, Hallelujah, I am on my way.""

569361,A2419QAWNE8TI2,B000056HEE,Revive Me,"[2, 10]","I started viewing this movie expecting to see a story with at least some degree of faith, hope and redemption.  Boy, was I sorely disappointed.  I'm not sure what the faith perspective of the positive reviewers is, but as a Christian, I can say with certainty that there is nothing Christian about this film, other than pointing out the fallen nature of this world, which is more than adequately portrayed in all of the filth that has spewed out of Lady Hollywood's mouth for decades.Elmer Gantry starts off this film as a boozing, womanizing, brawling, lying, conniving con man.  And what is he at the end of the film?  You guessed it--all of the above, with a little notoriety sprinkled on top for being a popular big tent revivalist.Sure, Elmer is a charismatic guy, but charisma is only valuable when placed into the service of virtue.  And virtuous Elmer ain't.  He says and does whatever it takes to reach whatever fleshly goal he seeks at the moment, using and discarding others (particularly women) at almost breakneck speed.And what's the deal with Sister Sharon?  At first she recognized Elmer for what he was, yet in a moment of weakness succumbed to his wiles, and ended up in flames while he walked off to continue his life of debauchery. (As an aside, as one of the film characters pointed out, Scripture does seem to circumscribe the role of women in speaking and leading in church gatherings, but that's another story.)There is nothing hopeful or uplifting about this film.  There is heavy drinking, sexual imagery and innuendo, profanity, and more.  In some ways, the most ""moral"" character is the journalist who covers the revival story.  Yet he is an admitted agnostic, and in some ways it's hard to blame him if the only professing Christians he has seen are the losers like Elmer and Sharon whose private lives belie everything they profess in public.If you watch this film looking for a realistic portrayal of Christianity, you won't get that.  There are many who claim the name of Christ but are far from Him.  Calling yourself a Christian and going to religious meetings doesn't make you one any more than calling yourself a Ford and going to garages makes you an automobile.Unfortunately, there seem to be very few cinematic portrayals of genuine Christian faith (Alex Kendrick's films probably come closest).  If you're seeking spiritual truth, I'd skip the film and just go pick up a New Testament.  Ask God to remove your blinders as you read it.

That's the young Burt Lancaster who deservedly won an Oscar for playing the con-artist preacher in love with a true Joan of Arc, played by the white-robed Jean Simmons, who is sadly consumed by her own fire.

569367,A2U974OZOVRT7A,B000056HEE,Tom Without Pity,"[1, 2]","This is a review of the United Artists film ELMER GANTRY (1960) directed by Richard Brooks and  released as an MGM DVD in 2001. Based on the novel by Sinclair Lewis, Elmer Gantry, dynamically played by Burt Lancaster,  is the story of a born salesman who turns his hand to tent revival preaching. Gantry is heavily influenced by the success and personal charisma of Sister Sharon Falconer, played by Jean Simmons, a character apparently modeled on the real life Aimee Semple McPherson , a tent show'radio revivalist on the west coast in the 1920s.The fictional preacher Gantry is on his way to the top with his energy charged tent meetings and charismatic public conversions of sinners until an old girlfriend, who he left in the lurch years ago and is now a fallen woman runs into him.  The woman, Lulu Bains,  played by Shirley Jones, sets him up in a blackmail then publicity sting to show the public what a hypocritical womanizing sinner their fast rising young preacher really is. The prostitute's scheme also shows Sister Falconer once and for all that her fair haired boy, now suitor, is not the divine powerhouse he had once possibly seemed to be.The climax of ELMER GANTRY  is almost like divine retribution straight out of the good book, and maybe a little overdone.  But on the whole I think ELMER GANTRY is a very fine film with excellent performances all around, a well made example of the late classic era of Hollywood film making with beautiful cinematography by John Alton, whose solo shots of the different characters are very much like oil portraits. ELMER GANTRY is a well written and produced film, with an Oscar winning performance by Burt Lancaster.I give ELMER GANTRY Four and One Half Stars",4,The All Inclusive Tent,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,1714,"['review', 'United', 'Artists', 'film', 'ELMER', 'GANTRY', '1960', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'released', 'MGM', 'DVD', '2001', 'Based', 'novel', 'Sinclair', 'Lewis', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'dynamically', 'played', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'story', 'born', 'salesman', 'who', 'hand', 'tent', 'revival', 'preaching', 'Gantry', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'success', 'personal', 'charisma', 'Sister', 'Sharon', 'Falconer', 'played', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'character', 'apparently', 'modeled', 'real', 'life', 'Aimee', 'Semple', 'McPherson', 'tent', ""show'radio"", 'revivalist', 'west', 'coast', '1920s.The', 'fictional', 'preacher', 'Gantry', 'way', 'top', 'energy', 'charged', 'tent', 'meetings', 'charismatic', 'public', 'conversions', 'sinners', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'left', 'lurch', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'fallen', 'woman', 'woman', 'Lulu', 'Bains', 'played', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'up', 'blackmail', 'then', 'publicity', 'sting', 'show', 'public', 'what', 'hypocritical', 'womanizing', 'sinner', 'fast', 'rising', 'young', 'preacher', 'really', 'prostitute', 'scheme', 'also', 'Sister', 'Falconer', 'once', 'fair', 'haired', 'boy', 'now', 'suitor', 'not', 'divine', 'powerhouse', 'had', 'once', 'possibly', 'seemed', 'be.The', 'climax', 'ELMER', 'GANTRY', 'almost', 'like', 'divine', 'retribution', 'straight', 'good', 'book', 'maybe', 'little', 'overdone', 'whole', 'think', 'ELMER', 'GANTRY', 'very', 'fine', 'film', 'excellent', 'performances', 'around', 'well', 'made', 'example', 'late', 'classic', 'era', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'making', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'John', 'Alton', 'solo', 'shots', 'different', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'oil', 'portraits', 'ELMER', 'GANTRY', 'well', 'written', 'produced', 'film', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'Burt', 'Lancaster.I', 'give', 'ELMER', 'GANTRY', 'Four', 'One', 'Half', 'Stars']",N/A
569368,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000056HEE,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","Elmer Gantry doesn't need a lightshow, radio mikes or his own TV channel, he creates his own energy and carries all before him with a gift of the gab that can turn any situation to his advantage. Phoney as a two-dollar bill and first seen drinking, womanising and fighting in that order, Gantry is a crude, vulgar showoff with a vocabulary that belongs in an outhouse who goes from selling vacuum cleaners to selling religion in a travelling revival show. Worming his way under her guard to become bad cop to Jean Simmons' Sister Sharon's good cop, he damns them and she saves them. If he's a sharp operator, she's not exactly a mug  herself: ""God chose me. I chose you."" Before long, he's converting her to the ways of the flesh and all hell breaks loose...Sinclair Lewis' novel may well be Book of the Month Club choice stuff, but at least in those days books of the month were about something. A work of both ambition and substance, this is the kind of film that Day of the Locust wanted to be. Sharing many of the same themes, but putting them over with breathless energy, it is filled with outstanding moments. Gantry's reunion with Shirley Jones is touchingly pathetic without being openly sentimental, giving a real sense of wasted lives, and there is real tension in the miracle leading up to the genuinely apocalyptic ending that puts Frank Capra's earlier Miracle Woman to shame.The sexual chemistry between the leads is just as convincing, and the film is not without humour as well, even throwing in a sly in-joke when Gantry tells how Arthur Kennedy's doubting Thomas learned his use of words from ""Sinclair Lewis, lot of other atheists."" The films own use of language is superb, and not just when sermonising. It is hard to believe that some of the dialogue crept past the 50s censors - although there is no foul language, the screenplay is incredibly daring for its day. Shirley Jones recounts to her fellow whores the time Elmer ""rammed the fear of God into me so fast I never heard my father's footsteps"" in the pulpit one Christmas Eve, while Gantry propositions Sharon with ""I'd like to tear those holy wings off you, make a real woman of you. I'd show you what heaven's like."" It's no surprise that MGM pulled out of a planned version in the mid-50s to be produced by and star William Holden (who was so sure the film would be made he turned down the lead in Giant to make it).It may not be Lancaster's greatest performance, but in true Oscar-winning fashion it's hands down his showiest - at times you want to tell him to put those teeth away before he hurts someone. You know exactly what he is in any given scene, it's putting them all together that makes it hard to get a complete picture. Gantry's semi-redemption is more subtle and complex and elusive than the cinematic norm and therefore more poignant.Both Simmons and Oscar-winner Jones, cast wildly against type as the fallen woman, are superb. The under-appreciated Arthur Kennedy, in what is almost a dress rehearsal for his cynical reporter bit in Lawrence of Arabia also offers strong support: the moment where his dictation of a newspaper article matches the power of Gantry's oratory and stops the other reporters in their tracks is beautifully underplayed.The DVD includes a trailer with Lancaster's Gantry selling the film the way he sells religion. Wearing its length lightly and taking you with it every step of the way, this is more than worth the money, with outstanding direction and screenwriting from Richard Brooks and great performances from all concerned, Elmer Gantry is terrific.",5,"""People are all the same in one thing.
