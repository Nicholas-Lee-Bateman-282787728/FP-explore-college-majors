As is the cinematography, which synthesizes the scenes he was exposed to and the paintings he made of those scenes, as well as the emotion and color which his words articulate so movingly. I especially appreciate that the editor selected many of the passages in which Vincent describes, with both nuance and intensity, the colors he is seeing and what they signify to him; I have never heard any other human in any field speak so movingly and poignantly about color. I've read Vincent's letters and seen other films about him, but this made me feel far closer to him than I ever have before.

912552,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0009U6XD4,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[34, 35]","""I will not live without love."" ~Vincent van GoghThe story of Vincent van Gogh's life seems best told in his own words, complete with casual sketches, detailed drawings and famous paintings. In the spirit of ""Crows"" in Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (where we see the Langlois Bridge and Crows in the Wheatfields brought to life), we are entertained by visions of painting after painting. It is fun to watch Akira Kurosawa's Dreams after viewing this movie because then you recognize the paintings that were brought to life in a dream of pure visual delight.The Caf&eacute; Terrace, Yellow House, Fishing Boats, Bedroom at Arles, Starry Night and Sunflowers are some of the paintings featured, but there is an entire world of Vincent van Gogh's art that is introduced with analytical letters written to his brother. In these letters he tells his brother of the art he is working on and his motivating influences all while we the viewer are entertained with the art, scenes from nature and the acting out of various scenes (Night Caf&eacute; with Pool Table) that eventually became paintings. There are fields of olive trees from Olive Trees 1889 and Vincent's letter speaks of the difficulty of capturing the colors in the soil and tree bark.When you hear the story of Vincent van Gogh's life in his own words, suddenly he becomes so much more than a famous artist. His life is filled with tragedy and hardship, but he is also able to find stunning beauty through his love of philosophy and his view of the world seems to remain relatively positive right up until his death. He not only travels, he also lives with Gauguin. The art shown after living with Gauguin shows how being able to relate to someone like himself increased his creativity.He speaks of how he is a self-taught artist and how thankful he is that he was not trained and therefore had to experiment with paint to produce eye-catching effects. As he travels, his world expands and so does his art. He tries to capture his experience in 1,800 works during his life and while they can't all be shown in this movie, the director tries to capture as many beautiful scenes and pieces of art as he can in as many ways film allows. The creativity is delightful as actors take their places and then a picture emerges.""How lovely yellow is."" ~Vincent van GoghHe seems far from debilitating madness in his letters (he talks about episodes) and more inclined towards deep contemplations and philosophical discussions. He seems to be reaching out to a world that does not quite understand him all while trying to make the lives of those around him less lonely.The movie begins with his lofty spiritual goals and ends with his death. We learn so much about this artist, of his being homesick for the land of pictures and how he felt compelled to capture the daily activities of the peasants.The goodness in his heart truly shines through the darkness of his later days as he helps a woman most would have shunned and must live without the love of the woman he wanted to marry.Through a weaving of philosophy and art, Paul Cox created a stunning and somewhat mesmerizing journey through the life of Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890). I watched both the movie and the interview three times because the thoughts and experiences are so compelling. Of all the movies I've seen on an artist's life, this is my favorite. What makes this truly memorable are the letters from Vincent to Theo read eloquently by John Hurt.After watching this, you may find yourself looking for a book about Vincent van Gogh's art or his letters in order to find some of the art shown in this movie or to expand your knowledge of his writing and philosophy. While many emphasize the madness, this movie emphasizes the struggle for beauty and the unending desire of the artist to capture all that he loves.~The Rebecca Review",5,In his own words...,1131580800,"11 10, 2005",2005,3838,"['will', 'not', 'live', 'love', '~Vincent', 'van', 'GoghThe', 'story', 'Vincent', 'van', 'Gogh', 'life', 'best', 'told', 'own', 'words', 'complete', 'casual', 'sketches', 'detailed', 'drawings', 'famous', 'paintings', 'spirit', 'Crows', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Dreams', 'where', 'see', 'Langlois', 'Bridge', 'Crows', 'Wheatfields', 'brought', 'life', 'are', 'entertained', 'visions', 'painting', 'painting', 'fun', 'watch', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Dreams', 'viewing', 'movie', 'then', 'recognize', 'paintings', 'were', 'brought', 'life', 'dream', 'pure', 'visual', 'delight.The', 'Caf', 'eacute', 'Terrace', 'Yellow', 'House', 'Fishing', 'Boats', 'Bedroom', 'Arles', 'Starry', 'Night', 'Sunflowers', 'are', 'paintings', 'featured', 'entire', 'world', 'Vincent', 'van', 'Gogh', 'art', 'introduced', 'analytical', 'letters', 'written', 'brother', 'letters', 'brother', 'art', 'working', 'motivating', 'influences', 'viewer', 'are', 'entertained', 'art', 'scenes', 'nature', 'acting', 'various', 'scenes', 'Night', 'Caf', 'eacute', 'Pool', 'Table', 'eventually', 'became', 'paintings', 'are', 'fields', 'olive', 'trees', 'Olive', 'Trees', '1889', 'Vincent', 'letter', 'speaks', 'difficulty', 'capturing', 'colors', 'soil', 'tree', 'bark.When', 'hear', 'story', 'Vincent', 'van', 'Gogh', 'life', 'own', 'words', 'suddenly', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'famous', 'artist', 'life', 'filled', 'tragedy', 'hardship', 'also', 'able', 'find', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'love', 'philosophy', 'view', 'world', 'remain', 'relatively', 'positive', 'right', 'up', 'death', 'not', 'only', 'travels', 'also', 'Gauguin', 'art', 'shown', 'living', 'Gauguin', 'how', 'being', 'able', 'relate', 'someone', 'increased', 'creativity.He', 'speaks', 'how', 'self-taught', 'artist', 'how', 'thankful', 'was', 'not', 'trained', 'therefore', 'had', 'experiment', 'paint', 'produce', 'eye-catching', 'effects', 'world', 'expands', 'so', 'art', 'capture', 'experience', '1,800', 'works', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'be', 'shown', 'movie', 'director', 'capture', 'many', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'pieces', 'art', 'can', 'as', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'creativity', 'delightful', 'actors', 'take', 'places', 'then', 'picture', 'How', 'lovely', 'yellow', '~Vincent', 'van', 'GoghHe', 'far', 'debilitating', 'madness', 'letters', 'episodes', 'more', 'inclined', 'towards', 'deep', 'contemplations', 'philosophical', 'discussions', 'be', 'reaching', 'world', 'not', 'quite', 'understand', 'trying', 'make', 'lives', 'less', 'lonely.The', 'movie', 'lofty', 'spiritual', 'goals', 'death', 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'artist', 'being', 'homesick', 'land', 'pictures', 'how', 'felt', 'compelled', 'capture', 'daily', 'activities', 'peasants.The', 'goodness', 'heart', 'truly', 'shines', 'darkness', 'later', 'days', 'woman', 'most', 'would', 'have', 'shunned', 'must', 'live', 'love', 'woman', 'wanted', 'marry.Through', 'weaving', 'philosophy', 'art', 'Paul', 'Cox', 'created', 'stunning', 'somewhat', 'mesmerizing', 'journey', 'life', 'Vincent', 'van', 'Gogh', '1853-1890', 'watched', 'movie', 'interview', 'three', 'times', 'thoughts', 'experiences', 'are', 'so', 'compelling', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'artist', 'life', 'favorite', 'What', 'truly', 'memorable', 'are', 'letters', 'Vincent', 'Theo', 'read', 'eloquently', 'John', 'Hurt.After', 'watching', 'may', 'find', 'looking', 'book', 'Vincent', 'van', 'Gogh', 'art', 'letters', 'order', 'find', 'art', 'shown', 'movie', 'expand', 'knowledge', 'writing', 'philosophy', 'many', 'emphasize', 'madness', 'movie', 'struggle', 'beauty', 'unending', 'desire', 'artist', 'capture', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Vincent: The Life and Death of Vincent Van Gogh

Interspersed with countless images of Van Gogh's original work, are cinematic images of the landscapes, the still-lifes, the town, and the people that Van Gogh knew so well.  Cox unassumingly uses real people and costumes in an almost dream-like fashion; they exist along the edges of the film, in a sort of blur; as if we were living directly in Van Gogh's dreams and memories.  What's most astounding though, is that I never knew what an incredibly gifted writer Van Gogh was.  The entire film is narration of Van Gogh's words, in letters written to his brother.  His passion, idealism, and frustration are articulated in ways that are so tangible ... it makes all other works about frustrated idealists seem downright silly.  It took me a while to warm up to John Hurt's narration because I kept envisioning him instead of Van Gogh, but after a little while I got lost in the words just and concentrated on the feeling that Hurt was evoking.  By the end I was in tears.

912555,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,B0009U6XD4,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[11, 11]","+++++Here's what I know about artist Vincent Van Gogh (1853 to 1890): (1) He only sold one painting in his lifetime (ironic since one of his paintings in modern times sold for 40 million dollars) (2) he sliced off part of his ear in a fit of madness.This documentary reveals that there was much, much more to this man.  I say documentary but this is not your ordinary run-of-the-mill documentary that was written and directed by acclaimed filmmaker Paul Cox.Beware!  This is not a biography of Van Gogh but a look into his psyche during the last eighteen years of his life.This documentary consists of British actor John Hurt reading from selected letters Van Gough wrote mostly to his younger brother (named Theodore or ""Theo"").  These letters date from 1872 to 1890.  Cox has thus found an effective and unique way to tell Van Gogh's story even though it's somewhat repetitive to listen to Hurt's voice for an hour and a half.  (I must admit though, Hurt's voice is interesting and distinctive.)I learned what an incredibly gifted writer Van Gogh was.  These letters reveal his passion, idealism, and frustration.  Here is a sentence from one of his letters that I feel accurately and succinctly sums up his life:""It is basically true that a painter is a man who is too absorbed in what his eyes see and is not sufficiently master of the rest of his life.""On screen, we see a collection of imagery (sometimes random) that relates (sometimes vaguely) to the themes in the letters, interspersed with a few drawings and paintings of Van Gogh's famous works.  Occasionally music accompanies the images, some of it classical.Overall, this documentary helps the viewer better understand not only Van Gogh's ""life and death"" but also his passion for painting.The DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are a few extras, the most important, in my opinion, being a brief written biography of Van Gogh.  For Paul Cox fans there is also a 55-minute featurette entitled ""A Journey with Paul Cox.""Finally, here is a sentence from the above written biography that sums up Van Gough's greatness as an artist:""Vincent Van Gogh's direct brushstrokes, radiant colors, and passionate approach to his subjects made him one of the greatest artists of the last hundred years.""In conclusion, this is an unusual and unusually absorbing work with an original vision.

Thankfully, this film by Paul Cox presents a more realistic view of Van Gogh, reminding us of the artist's anguish and the very great difficulty he had coming to terms with his sadness and inadequacies.  Cox shows Van Gogh's need to give shape to his suffering through art.  Van Gogh's life is rendered through his own words, from his letters, read by John Hurt, and through still imagery of the artist's sketches and paintings.  These still images are interspersed with gorgeous nature shots, interiors, and the occasional effective recreation of spaces that inhabit Van Gogh's paintings.  A really big bonus to this DVD is the interview with Paul Cox, in which you see how Cox's life somewhat parallels Van Gogh's in terms of childhood unhappiness, loneliness, and the need to express himself through imagery.  This interview will appeal especially to artists because it is so inspiring.Cox reminds the viewer what art IS and why it is created and explains to us why there is so much mediocrity in film.  Indeed, Cox's views on the need to rise above mediocrity are very similar to Van Gogh's.",5,From Angst to Art,1157673600,"09 8, 2006",2006,1304,"['Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'wildly', 'popular', 'today', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'imagined', 'work', 'post', 'cards', 'massive', 'coffee', 'table', 'books', 'T-shirts', 'even', 'venerated', 'pop', 'song', 'Don', 'MClean', 'Thankfully', 'film', 'Paul', 'Cox', 'more', 'realistic', 'view', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'reminding', 'artist', 'anguish', 'very', 'great', 'difficulty', 'had', 'coming', 'terms', 'sadness', 'inadequacies', 'Cox', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'need', 'give', 'shape', 'suffering', 'art', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'life', 'rendered', 'own', 'words', 'letters', 'read', 'John', 'Hurt', 'still', 'imagery', 'artist', 'sketches', 'paintings', 'still', 'images', 'are', 'interspersed', 'gorgeous', 'nature', 'shots', 'interiors', 'occasional', 'effective', 'recreation', 'spaces', 'inhabit', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'paintings', 'really', 'big', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'interview', 'Paul', 'Cox', 'see', 'how', 'Cox', 'life', 'somewhat', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'terms', 'childhood', 'unhappiness', 'loneliness', 'need', 'express', 'imagery', 'interview', 'will', 'appeal', 'especially', 'artists', 'so', 'inspiring.Cox', 'viewer', 'what', 'art', 'IS', 'why', 'created', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'mediocrity', 'film', 'Indeed', 'Cox', 'views', 'need', 'rise', 'mediocrity', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'Van', 'Gogh']",Vincent: The Life and Death of Vincent Van Gogh
