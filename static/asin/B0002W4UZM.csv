What an inspiration to see someone who went through what he went through come out on top.  This just goes to show that you can make it no matter how hard your struggle is.  This is why God lets us go through different trails and tribulations.  When we prevail, we can tell the story and help someone else.  The music is a blessing and it speaks directly to your heart.

I'm glad he did it himself and used all the people that went through this with him.It is raw and true.  This story will be able to reach out and help others who are struggling with the trials in their lives.  It will give them hope to go on and have faith that God will bring them through whatever they are dealing with and Donnie is a living witness that God can.  He will help others to step out on faith and let God heal them.  Nothing is impossible for him.  He has a testimony that everyone should see and hear.  He lets you know that God is real even when you've gone through the worst of times, God can bring you through and have something so amazing for you that you can't even comprehend it.He let go and let God.  Awesome Donnie!!!  I recommend everyone to see this story. If you are seeking God or just lost and trying to find your way, see this video, it will bring you to the light. It's worth every penny.  I'm going to buy more to pass out to people that need to see this story, you should too.",5,"God's love, mercy,favor & grace",1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,1079,"['Donnie', 'awesome', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'told', 'better', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'used', 'people', 'went', 'him.It', 'raw', 'true', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'reach', 'out', 'help', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'struggling', 'trials', 'lives', 'will', 'give', 'hope', 'go', 'have', 'faith', 'God', 'will', 'bring', 'whatever', 'are', 'dealing', 'Donnie', 'living', 'witness', 'God', 'can', 'will', 'help', 'others', 'step', 'out', 'faith', 'let', 'God', 'heal', 'Nothing', 'impossible', 'testimony', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'hear', 'know', 'God', 'real', 'even', 'when', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'worst', 'times', 'God', 'can', 'bring', 'have', 'something', 'so', 'amazing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'comprehend', 'it.He', 'let', 'go', 'let', 'God', 'Awesome', 'Donnie', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'see', 'story', 'are', 'seeking', 'God', 'just', 'lost', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'see', 'video', 'will', 'bring', 'light', 'worth', 'penny', ""'m"", 'going', 'buy', 'more', 'pass', 'out', 'people', 'need', 'see', 'story', 'should', 'too']",The Donnie McClurkin Story: From Darkness to Light

Of course being my age I don't like many of the new sounds, but this young man has many songs that I enjoy hearing.  The story of how he got to where he is, takes a vast amount of guts to tell.  I relate to much of the story because we were a singing family.  Never really well known, but then I raised my children as a singing family and much of what was shown in his video, also happened in my family as I raised my children.  It was almost like seeing relatives, but then that is probably part of his reaching power, he is so very like everyones family.  I loved it",5,A surprising young singer,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,632,"['first', 'heard', 'young', 'man', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'retired', 'course', 'being', 'age', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'many', 'new', 'sounds', 'young', 'man', 'many', 'songs', 'enjoy', 'hearing', 'story', 'how', 'got', 'where', 'vast', 'amount', 'guts', 'tell', 'relate', 'much', 'story', 'were', 'singing', 'family', 'Never', 'really', 'well', 'known', 'then', 'raised', 'children', 'singing', 'family', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'shown', 'video', 'also', 'happened', 'family', 'raised', 'children', 'was', 'almost', 'seeing', 'relatives', 'then', 'probably', 'part', 'reaching', 'power', 'so', 'very', 'everyones', 'family', 'loved']",The Donnie McClurkin Story: From Darkness to Light
848313,AH32BK6OVLY93,B0002W4UZM,"Superwoman AJ ""AJ""","[16, 17]","My spirit connected with Donnie McClurkin's when I first heard of him on his first solo CD in 2001. Songs like ""Stand"" and ""Have a Talk with Jesus"" lifted me above my cares during a very trying time in my life.  Somehow I knew Donnie was singing from his heart. He was not just making good music, he was commisserating with the Lord whether 'we' were getting it or not.  I saw him at Hopeville in San Diego a few years ago and the electricity in the room made me stand up and shout to the Lord.  It was the most amazing corporate worship experience I ever had up to that point.  This DVD gave insight to the reason why Donnie praises and worships the Lord the way he does.  He has a testimony that will encourage and inspire any of us who have a 'past' that satan wants to use to hold us down.  God has a greater purpose for His creation and He will use every experience we go through to that end if we place ourselves in His hands.  He is the 'recovery' hurting people need.  It is a wonderful, unashamed 'life story' that Donnie shares with us on this DVD. It can encourage anyone, no matter what you've been through or have done, that you can get back up again.  God bless Donnie McClurkin for sharing this very open, honest, poignant testimony of his life and deliverance.",5,This DVD confirms what my spirit always felt --,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,1276,"['spirit', 'connected', 'Donnie', 'McClurkin', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'first', 'solo', 'CD', '2001', 'Songs', 'Stand', 'Have', 'Talk', 'Jesus', 'lifted', 'cares', 'very', 'trying', 'time', 'life', 'Somehow', 'knew', 'Donnie', 'was', 'singing', 'heart', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'making', 'good', 'music', 'was', 'commisserating', 'Lord', ""'we"", 'were', 'getting', 'not', 'saw', 'Hopeville', 'San', 'Diego', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'electricity', 'room', 'made', 'stand', 'up', 'shout', 'Lord', 'was', 'most', 'amazing', 'corporate', 'worship', 'experience', 'ever', 'had', 'up', 'point', 'DVD', 'gave', 'insight', 'reason', 'why', 'Donnie', 'Lord', 'way', 'testimony', 'will', 'encourage', 'inspire', 'who', 'have', ""'past"", 'satan', 'use', 'hold', 'down', 'God', 'greater', 'purpose', 'creation', 'will', 'use', 'experience', 'go', 'end', 'place', 'hands', ""'recovery"", 'hurting', 'people', 'need', 'wonderful', 'unashamed', 'story', 'Donnie', 'shares', 'DVD', 'can', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'matter', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'have', 'done', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'up', 'again', 'God', 'bless', 'Donnie', 'McClurkin', 'sharing', 'very', 'open', 'honest', 'poignant', 'testimony', 'life', 'deliverance']",The Donnie McClurkin Story: From Darkness to Light
