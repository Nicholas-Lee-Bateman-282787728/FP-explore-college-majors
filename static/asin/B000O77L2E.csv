1062769,A1BMQA5PIZKU1P,B000O77L2E,"Bryan ""Dragonboots""","[13, 15]","If George Strait started doing stand up it would be something like Rodney Carrington(Obviouly George would have to go 'blue' with the language. lol).  With the jeans, shirt and cowboy hat, he is not far from being a country singer - and he can sing as well as be funny.  I'm new to the world of Rodney so I cannot really compare this DVD to anything he's done in the past but now I am a new fan.The songs are the most entertaining part of his show and, if you don't listen to the lyrics too closely, you'd swear you was watching a George Strait acoustic show.  By that I mean the guy can actually carry a tune - the comedy is not in his bad singing but in the lyrics.  The way he sings with funny facial expressions is hillarious and his piano player sideman getting into the act as well by going off on tangents singing until Rodney stops him.  I am not easily offended at all so if you are, this guy is not for you.  Funny is funny, if you can't handle profanity or sexual references then you should probably stick to something like Bill Cosby.  Otherwise, this DVD is well worth buying and it makes you wonder how far Rodney would get if he actually turned into a serious singer(which in the bonus materials on the DVD, he says he has no intention of doing).The bonus feature is entertaining too.  You get to see Rodney meet the fans, hang out backstage and hear a few new songs not on the stand-up show including a 'serious' song he wrote about a friend of his who passed away.  Be sure and listen to that one.A very funny and entertaining DVD unless your a fuddy duddy who can't handle language.",5,If George Strait did stand up,1203206400,"02 17, 2008",2008,1600,"['George', 'Strait', 'started', 'doing', 'stand', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'Rodney', 'Carrington', 'Obviouly', 'George', 'would', 'have', 'go', ""'blue"", 'language', 'lol', 'jeans', 'shirt', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'not', 'far', 'being', 'country', 'singer', 'can', 'sing', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'funny', ""'m"", 'new', 'world', 'Rodney', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'compare', 'DVD', 'anything', 'done', 'past', 'now', 'am', 'new', 'fan.The', 'songs', 'are', 'most', 'entertaining', 'part', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'lyrics', 'too', 'closely', ""'d"", 'swear', 'was', 'watching', 'George', 'Strait', 'acoustic', 'show', 'mean', 'guy', 'can', 'actually', 'carry', 'tune', 'comedy', 'not', 'bad', 'singing', 'lyrics', 'way', 'funny', 'facial', 'expressions', 'hillarious', 'piano', 'player', 'sideman', 'getting', 'act', 'well', 'going', 'off', 'tangents', 'singing', 'Rodney', 'am', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'so', 'are', 'guy', 'not', 'Funny', 'funny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'profanity', 'sexual', 'references', 'then', 'should', 'probably', 'stick', 'something', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Otherwise', 'DVD', 'well', 'worth', 'buying', 'wonder', 'how', 'far', 'Rodney', 'would', 'get', 'actually', 'turned', 'serious', 'singer', 'bonus', 'materials', 'DVD', 'intention', 'doing', '.The', 'bonus', 'feature', 'entertaining', 'too', 'get', 'see', 'Rodney', 'meet', 'fans', 'hang', 'out', 'backstage', 'hear', 'few', 'new', 'songs', 'not', 'stand-up', 'show', 'including', ""'serious"", 'song', 'wrote', 'friend', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'Be', 'sure', 'listen', 'one.A', 'very', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'DVD', 'fuddy', 'duddy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'language']",N/A
