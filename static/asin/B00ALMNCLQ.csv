At the zoo, he was treated like royalty.  He starts telling the animals about Valentines and how to make them so he can put them on his Valentine tree when he is interrupted by word of King Julian's Love Potion.The animals flock to find out what it is all about and eventually everyone wants a shot of it so they can become irresistible.  Marty wants in because there is a stunning new Opaki in town and everyone is trying to catch her eye. Will the Love Potion #9 that fell from the sky be the answer?
