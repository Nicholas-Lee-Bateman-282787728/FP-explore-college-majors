1176696,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B001CIOCNK,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 7]","Awhile ago, I watched an independent movie called ""Shortbus"", a sexually graphic movie concerning everything to do with sex from orgasms to homosexuality to threesomes and practically everything in between, sometimes all 3 at the same time. While I appreciated the intent of showing sex in a more straightforward (albeit rather ludicrous) manner, it fell flat thanks to really boring characters and not really finding any meaning in anything it did. This film is not as graphic as ""Shortbus"" but it does take on a few more realistic endeavors, not all of them successful but it certainly tries to do more than just parade naked bodies around.The film follows 5 vignettes: the couple (Josh Dean, Kristin Booth) who are getting to be in a bit of a predictable sex life, the exes (Sonja Bennett and Josh Cooke) who might have feelings for the other still after the breakup, the first date (Callum Blue, Diora Baird) who wonder if sex on the first date is really something they should consider considering his frequent ""women from work"" bedding habits, the long-time friends (Aaron Abrams, Carly Pope) who have long dated the wrong people and try to look beyond the weirdness of doing anything sexual with a childhood friend and the roommates (Ennis Esmer, Natalie Lisinka, Peter Oldring) where the former 2 who are dating want their roommate to have sex with her while the boyfriend watches).Each vignette looks at sex in a more specific manner from the kinky to the emotional to the staleness of a sex life without spark and they tend to work though sometimes it's more for the intent than the actual scenes. The roommate ones for example are frequently annoying and the ones where I actually groaned at seeing simply because the boyfriend is well, the kind of guy who thinks he's funny when everyone's like ""shut the **** up, seriously"". The first date one feels a little off with both sides obviously wanting a good time though it briefly shows signs of sincerity that one is getting tired of just one night stand one after the other but that gets jettisoned in the next scene.The best for me personally is the exes one since it really seems to hit an emotional core, actors have good chemistry and above all, is the one vignette where I actually want to see more of. The couple one is probably the more outrageous when we see the girlfriend's plan though it's actually one of the more hilarious ones and the friend's one has the right idea, the part about the weirdness between friends didn't come completely around but it's a funny one anyway. The actors are fine for their parts but of course they don't feel as fully developed and aside from the exes story, none ever have much resonating power other than the amount of sexy time they have.It's worth a watch and whether or not you'll relate to a certain one, it's certainly an entertaining watch anyway and it isn't as graphically sexual as Shortbus nor as vapid and aimless and has something to say for once. Might not be that clear but it certainly puts in an effort.",4,Watch the world's greatest pastime,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,3024,"['Awhile', 'ago', 'watched', 'independent', 'movie', 'called', 'Shortbus', 'sexually', 'graphic', 'movie', 'concerning', 'everything', 'do', 'sex', 'orgasms', 'homosexuality', 'threesomes', 'practically', 'everything', 'sometimes', '3', 'same', 'time', 'appreciated', 'intent', 'showing', 'sex', 'more', 'straightforward', 'rather', 'ludicrous', 'manner', 'fell', 'flat', 'thanks', 'really', 'boring', 'characters', 'not', 'really', 'finding', 'meaning', 'anything', 'did', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'graphic', 'Shortbus', 'take', 'few', 'more', 'realistic', 'endeavors', 'not', 'successful', 'certainly', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'parade', 'naked', 'bodies', 'around.The', 'film', '5', 'vignettes', 'couple', 'Josh', 'Dean', 'Kristin', 'Booth', 'who', 'are', 'getting', 'be', 'bit', 'predictable', 'sex', 'life', 'exes', 'Sonja', 'Bennett', 'Josh', 'Cooke', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'feelings', 'other', 'still', 'breakup', 'first', 'date', 'Callum', 'Blue', 'Diora', 'Baird', 'who', 'wonder', 'sex', 'first', 'date', 'really', 'something', 'should', 'consider', 'considering', 'frequent', 'women', 'work', 'bedding', 'habits', 'long-time', 'friends', 'Aaron', 'Abrams', 'Carly', 'Pope', 'who', 'have', 'long', 'dated', 'wrong', 'people', 'try', 'look', 'weirdness', 'doing', 'anything', 'sexual', 'childhood', 'friend', 'roommates', 'Ennis', 'Esmer', 'Natalie', 'Lisinka', 'Peter', 'Oldring', 'where', 'former', '2', 'who', 'are', 'dating', 'want', 'roommate', 'have', 'sex', 'boyfriend', 'watches', '.Each', 'vignette', 'looks', 'sex', 'more', 'specific', 'manner', 'kinky', 'emotional', 'staleness', 'sex', 'life', 'spark', 'tend', 'work', 'sometimes', 'more', 'intent', 'actual', 'scenes', 'roommate', 'ones', 'example', 'are', 'frequently', 'annoying', 'ones', 'where', 'actually', 'groaned', 'seeing', 'simply', 'boyfriend', 'well', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'funny', 'when', 'everyone', 'shut', '****', 'up', 'seriously', 'first', 'date', 'one', 'little', 'off', 'sides', 'obviously', 'wanting', 'good', 'time', 'signs', 'sincerity', 'one', 'getting', 'tired', 'just', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'one', 'other', 'jettisoned', 'next', 'scene.The', 'best', 'personally', 'exes', 'one', 'really', 'hit', 'emotional', 'core', 'actors', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'one', 'vignette', 'where', 'actually', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'couple', 'one', 'probably', 'more', 'outrageous', 'when', 'see', 'girlfriend', 'plan', 'actually', 'one', 'more', 'hilarious', 'ones', 'friend', 'one', 'right', 'idea', 'part', 'weirdness', 'friends', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'completely', 'funny', 'one', 'anyway', 'actors', 'are', 'fine', 'parts', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'fully', 'developed', 'aside', 'exes', 'story', 'none', 'ever', 'have', 'much', 'resonating', 'power', 'other', 'amount', 'sexy', 'time', 'have.It', 'worth', 'watch', 'not', ""'ll"", 'relate', 'certain', 'one', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'anyway', ""n't"", 'graphically', 'sexual', 'Shortbus', 'vapid', 'aimless', 'something', 'say', 'once', 'Might', 'not', 'be', 'clear', 'certainly', 'effort']",Y.P.F.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[2, 2]","Having one of the most jarring titles ever, YPF is a clever, often hilarious examination of young adult relationships.  If only we older slugs could have as much fun.  The film is a series of intertwined vignettes featuring various couples in various stages of--""development"":  an established couple in somewhat of a rut; two exes coming together for a one night fling; an awkward first date; two platonic friends looking to cross the line into intimacy; and a boyfriend willing to share his girlfriend with his roommate.  All the situations are well done and skillfully acted, although the roommate segment grew a bit lame (yet a pudgy Ennis Esmer was fun to watch as the overbearing, somewhat neurotic, boyfriend).Writers Aaron Abrams and Martin Gero (who also directs) deliver a witty, fast-paced story that flows smoothly and believably.  Much of it is very, very funny, yet each of the various segments wrap up in a touching, poignant manner.  I especially liked Abrams himself and a stunning Carly Pope playing the two buds who decide--because their own love lives are going nowhere--to throw caution to the wind and have casual sex; the chemistry and comedic timing between the two--as they realize their feelings for each other are anything but casual--are excellent.  There is no graphic sex, all scenes are tastefully and discreetly done so that the viewer fully understands what's going on, so don't be afraid YPF is too high voltage to watch.
