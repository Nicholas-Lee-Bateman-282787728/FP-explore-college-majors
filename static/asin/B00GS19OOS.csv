There she meets Tomoe the handsome fox deity who at first is none to thrilled with the new arrangement, they end up bickering at first and it is totally hilarious. There are some great action fight scenes between Tomoe and others. Other characters includeKurama a tengu crow demon aka fallen angelThere is the highly charismatic hotter then hell school heart throb, internationally famous singing star and Tengu crow demon who passes of as a fallen angel Kurama who is a challenge for Tomoe, once Kurama realizes he's in love with Nanami previously and seemingly uninterested Tomoe starts showing his possessive and jealous sideMizuki a snake godAdd to the mix Mizuki a kind caring and very lonely snake deity who meets then kidnaps Nanami who later on is rescued by fuming and very territorial Tomoe, Mizuki kisses Nanami so that he can become her second familiar and stay with her. This recipe makes for a wonderful banquet of comedy, romance, action, and some drama, it is one of the most comical heartwarming anime's out there. If you haven't seen it yet it is well worth a watchReccomendation for another funny romantic fox meets girl animeI love anime foxes and if you do then check out an anime that would go great with this one called [ Inu X Bocu Secret Service ] the lead male character Soushi in it is a fox like Tomoe only he has 9 tails.
