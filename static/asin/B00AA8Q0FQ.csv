1607125,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B00AA8Q0FQ,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[0, 0]","The Monster High videos are what well meaning if ultimately unhelpful activists in the bad old days of my youth used to call one hour commercials, that is animated children's TV shows based upon an existing line of toys.  (Frankly, I never understood the alleged vast moral difference between doing this as opposed to creating the TV show FIRST and only THEN merchandising the crap out of it with dolls, action figures, boardgames, Underoos, etc., but I digress.)  What matters most is the writing, and these videos are VERY well written!One of the things that makes the Monster High videos work so well is that the writers are gently making fun of the fashion doll mania that they are in fact trying to promote. Taking the universal American experience of High School and adding the twist of the entire student body being the children of famous monsters gives them endless possibilities for parody (and self parody, as the heroines are for the most part over the top, fashion crazed, popularity obsessed teenagers).  The animation and voice acting is no slouch, either!Chronologically the first movie is ""Why Do Ghouls Fall in Love"", which was the 3rd TV special, in fact the Valentine's Day Special.  Draculaura, Dracula's daughter, is turning Sweet 16, hundred that is, on February 14th, and the movie starts with what turns out to be Draculaura's idea for the perfect party,... to the horror of her ghoulfriends tasked with planning something that meets her insanely high expectations, though it turns out she comes by them honestly.  It seems that 400 years ago, her first boyfriend, a vampire named Valentine, created Valentine's Day just for her, but due to a ""misunderstanding with the locals"" (explained more fully in ""Ghoul's Rule"") she and her family had to flee the Old Country before the party so EVERY birthday/Valentine's Day party since gets measured in her mind against that first one she missed.Meanwhile, Monster High meany Toralei, miffed at not being invited to the party (because she's such a cruel jerk!), decides to get even by inviting Valentine (mimicking Draculaura's voice) to transfer to MH and renew their relationship.  Meanwhile, current Draculaura boyfriend, Clawd Wolf, facing similarly insanely high expectations, is walking the disaster strewn Path of ""Practical Gifts"".  After discovering that Draculaura is in real danger, and after C.A. Cupid misses the mark, quite literally, it is up to Draculaura's ghoulfriends to salvage a happy ending.  Gently Pushed Moral: Given the choice, dump the Fantasy in favor of the Real.Chronologically the second movie is ""Friday Night Frights"", which was the 5th TV special.  This is the story of how the MH version of Roller Derby (or is that Rollerball?) became coed after long tradition of male only teams, despite the fact that the first Skulltimate Roller Maze superstar a century ago was a girl, the mysteriously vanished Robecca Steam. Opening a year hence with the current coed team about to hit the floor, the movie flashes back a year to the Gravel City Gargoyles beating the MH team by cheating, which injured coach and best player Clawd Wolf (along with several other players) so badly that he's out for the season, effectively ending it for MH, until Frankie Stein gets another one of her crazy ideas: let ghouls play.  But this so goes against tradition that the remaining healthy male members quit the team in protest.  Now it is ALL up to our heroines to learn to play the game, to learn to WIN the game, to recruit the right ghouls, and to save their school (again, quite literally).  Gently Pushed Moral: Just because it's tradition doesn't mean it's good.Note: The earliest Monster High DVD was the 1st TV special ""New Ghoul at School"" but it was only made available in limited editions of the Dawn of the Dance series of dolls:Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Ghoulia Yelps Doll with exclusive DVD,Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Cleo De Nile Doll with exclusive DVD,Monster High
