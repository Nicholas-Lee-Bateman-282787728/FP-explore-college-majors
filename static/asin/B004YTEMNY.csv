Since I was a child growing up in German and watching ""Yancy Derringer"" in 1967, I was dreaming of going to New Orleans.I'm lucky that I was able to get all 34 episodes from ioffer dot com 3 years ago, but would love to replace my bootleg version by a commercial DVD set with the entire series.I wonder how much longer it will take?I also enjoyed ""Checkmate"", although I liked ""Honey West"" and ""Bourbon Street"" even more. Then there was ""M Squad"" which was almost as good as ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor) and I never missed an episode. At school everybody talked about ""M Squad"" and ""The Detectives"" on the next day. I think there is a large Baby Boomer potential for selling/releasing more of these classic TV series.Many of those who loved the ""Lassie"", ""Flipper"", ""Fury"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens). I wish these two wonderful old TV series and many others like ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance) would finally be released on DVD.",5,PLEASE PLEASE release all 34 episodes!,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,1239,"['Yancy', 'Derringer', 'favorite', 'TV', 'series', 'times', 'was', 'child', 'growing', 'up', 'German', 'watching', 'Yancy', 'Derringer', '1967', 'was', 'dreaming', 'going', 'New', 'Orleans.I', ""'m"", 'lucky', 'was', 'able', 'get', '34', 'episodes', 'ioffer', 'dot', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'would', 'love', 'replace', 'bootleg', 'version', 'commercial', 'DVD', 'set', 'entire', 'series.I', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'will', 'take', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Checkmate', 'liked', 'Honey', 'West', 'Bourbon', 'Street', 'even', 'more', 'Then', 'was', 'M', 'Squad', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Detectives', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'never', 'missed', 'episode', 'school', 'everybody', 'talked', 'M', 'Squad', 'Detectives', 'next', 'day', 'think', 'large', 'Baby', 'Boomer', 'potential', 'selling/releasing', 'more', 'classic', 'TV', 'series.Many', 'who', 'loved', 'Lassie', 'Flipper', 'Fury', 'Gentle', 'Ben', 'TV', 'series', 'childhood', 'also', 'liked', 'Kentucky', 'Jones', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'Farmer', 'Daughter', 'Inger', 'Stevens', 'wish', 'two', 'wonderful', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'many', 'others', 'A', 'Man', 'called', 'Shenandoah', 'Robert', 'Horton', 'Hank', 'Dick', 'Kallman', 'Paula', 'Prentiss', 'Magic', 'Boomerang', 'Greatest', 'Show', 'Earth', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'would', 'finally', 'be', 'released', 'DVD']",Yancy Derringer-Volume One-17 Episodes-Two Disc Set-Starring Jock Mahoney

1433910,A29SXQTFPRM62D,B004YTEMNY,"Ogleman ""jazzbuff""","[0, 0]","I remember watching this as a boy when it was first broadcast on TV -- and that goes back a ways. More importantly I remember how much I enjoyed the series. I've tried to find it for several years. It's been hard to locate except for very poor copies of 3 VHS tapes -- that is until now. I wasn't sure if I'd be as thrilled to have it once I got it but the jury is in and I can declare this series is still a hit with me.Why? First off, it's a different setting for a ""western"". It takes place in New Orleans, just after the Civil War. Then there's the main character, Yancy Derringer. Great name and the character is well played by Jock Mahoney, former stunt man turned TV star.Yancy is the kind of hero who doesn't play by the rules of typical heroes in westerns -- certainly not of that day. He more closely resembles Paladin in Have Gun, Will Travel. Both series have an edginess to them that I really enjoy. The stories themselves still hold up very well as good scripts with some nice twists in them -- not always so predictable. Adding to this is the more adult approach to the the world Yancy lives in -- He's a gambler, a ladies man, a bit of rougue if he needs to be. Plus with all that he has a great partner and friend -- an Indian who doesn't speak but is Yancy's life long friend,a guy who literally has his back and saves his bacon more than once. The Character he plays -- and it's a long name, not easy for me to remember, has a strength and a prescence that is a tribute to the actor who played him, X Brands. Yep, you read that right. In the TV credits that how his name is listed. Without him the series would be lacking a great element-and a very significant one.To sum it up, this DVD collection, though far from being pristeen in quality due to the transfer, is worth every bit of the money I paid for it. If you enjoy Have Gun, Will Travel then you'll enjoy this series, I'm almost certain of that.",5,Off beat Western Still Holds Up,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,1922,"['remember', 'watching', 'boy', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'back', 'ways', 'More', 'importantly', 'remember', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'series', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'find', 'several', 'years', 'been', 'hard', 'locate', 'very', 'poor', 'copies', '3', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'now', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'be', 'as', 'thrilled', 'have', 'once', 'got', 'jury', 'can', 'declare', 'series', 'still', 'hit', 'me.Why', 'First', 'different', 'setting', 'western', 'place', 'New', 'Orleans', 'just', 'Civil', 'War', 'Then', 'main', 'character', 'Yancy', 'Derringer', 'Great', 'name', 'character', 'well', 'played', 'Jock', 'Mahoney', 'former', 'stunt', 'man', 'turned', 'TV', 'star.Yancy', 'kind', 'hero', 'who', ""n't"", 'play', 'rules', 'typical', 'heroes', 'westerns', 'certainly', 'not', 'day', 'more', 'closely', 'Paladin', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'series', 'have', 'edginess', 'really', 'enjoy', 'stories', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'good', 'scripts', 'nice', 'twists', 'not', 'always', 'so', 'predictable', 'Adding', 'more', 'adult', 'approach', 'world', 'Yancy', 'gambler', 'ladies', 'man', 'bit', 'rougue', 'be', 'great', 'partner', 'friend', 'Indian', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Yancy', 'life', 'long', 'friend', 'guy', 'who', 'literally', 'back', 'bacon', 'more', 'once', 'Character', 'long', 'name', 'not', 'easy', 'remember', 'strength', 'prescence', 'tribute', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'X', 'Brands', 'Yep', 'read', 'right', 'TV', 'credits', 'how', 'name', 'listed', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'lacking', 'great', 'element-and', 'very', 'significant', 'one.To', 'sum', 'up', 'DVD', 'collection', 'far', 'being', 'pristeen', 'quality', 'due', 'transfer', 'worth', 'bit', 'money', 'paid', 'enjoy', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'then', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'series', ""'m"", 'almost', 'certain']",Yancy Derringer-Volume One-17 Episodes-Two Disc Set-Starring Jock Mahoney

The series didn't last long but is was different from the standard western fare at the time, taking palce in New Orleans after the civil war. More sophisticated I'd say, with a bit of wit. Our hero was a dashing young gentleman with a bit of larceny in his sole. The presentation leaves something to be desired, however. I'd rate the picture and sound watchable, but just barely. An awful lot of the stories take place after dark and picture doesn't offer much in gradation from black to white. Jock Mohoney was great as the civil war vet and his silent indian companion added further interest. So recommend the content - highly, but image on the screen is just not that good.
