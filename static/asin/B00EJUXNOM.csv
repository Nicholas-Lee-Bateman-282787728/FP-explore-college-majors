1667529,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00EJUXNOM,Charles Ashbacher,"[4, 4]","Adam is a priest in a very rural Polish village, so remote that some of the roads are nothing more than parallel dirt tracks. In addition to the normal duties of a parish priest, Adam also works with teenage men with extreme problems. It is mentioned that some of them have recently been in a reformatory and were given the opportunity to improve by engaging in physical labor under the supervision of Adam and another man.When a lonely local woman offers herself to Adam he declines, telling her his commitments to his profession that must take precedence. However, Adam has two secrets that he keeps from nearly everyone. The first is that he also has a love for alcohol and the second is that he is attracted to men. Despite Adam's best efforts at disguising his sexual tendencies, there are rumors in the community about his true orientation, including the writing of public graffiti.This film is an expression of a journey, where a man tries to repress his true self by immersing himself into an environment where he believes that the structure of that niche will help him cope. However, Adam discovers that self-denial is self-destruction and eventually he must first acknowledge his desires before he can determine whether he wants to act on them.This film will be controversial for obvious reasons, the depiction of priests as having sexual feelings of any kind has until recently been a powerful taboo, especially when those feelings are directed at the same gender. The producers of this film handle that conflict very well, depicting the inner turmoil as Adam struggles to resolve a problem where there is no uncomplicated path to resolution.",5,A human look at an enormous problem with no simple resolution,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,1653,"['Adam', 'priest', 'very', 'rural', 'Polish', 'village', 'so', 'remote', 'roads', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'parallel', 'dirt', 'tracks', 'addition', 'normal', 'duties', 'parish', 'priest', 'Adam', 'also', 'teenage', 'men', 'extreme', 'problems', 'mentioned', 'have', 'recently', 'been', 'reformatory', 'were', 'given', 'opportunity', 'improve', 'engaging', 'physical', 'labor', 'supervision', 'Adam', 'man.When', 'lonely', 'local', 'woman', 'Adam', 'telling', 'commitments', 'profession', 'must', 'take', 'precedence', 'However', 'Adam', 'two', 'secrets', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'first', 'also', 'love', 'alcohol', 'second', 'attracted', 'men', 'Adam', 'best', 'efforts', 'disguising', 'sexual', 'tendencies', 'are', 'rumors', 'community', 'true', 'orientation', 'including', 'writing', 'public', 'graffiti.This', 'film', 'expression', 'journey', 'where', 'man', 'repress', 'true', 'self', 'immersing', 'environment', 'where', 'structure', 'niche', 'will', 'help', 'cope', 'However', 'Adam', 'self-denial', 'self-destruction', 'eventually', 'must', 'first', 'acknowledge', 'desires', 'can', 'determine', 'act', 'them.This', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'controversial', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'depiction', 'priests', 'having', 'sexual', 'feelings', 'kind', 'recently', 'been', 'powerful', 'taboo', 'especially', 'when', 'feelings', 'are', 'directed', 'same', 'gender', 'producers', 'film', 'handle', 'conflict', 'very', 'well', 'depicting', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'Adam', 'resolve', 'problem', 'where', 'uncomplicated', 'path', 'resolution']",In the Name Of

1667533,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00EJUXNOM,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Spoiler AlertPolish director Malgorzata Szumowska accomplishes an outstandingly effective, brave examination of Catholic priesthood with all the inherent difficulties both within the life of being a celibate priest in a time when the world's eye is focused on the abuses within the Church. She wrote the screenplay with Michal Englert who also is the cinematographer. The film succeeds not only because of the sensitivity of the script but also because of the extraordinary acting by several of the members of the cast.Adam (the brilliant actor Andrzej Chyra) is a Jesuit Catholic priest who discovered his calling as a servant of God at the relatively late age of 21 and has been transferred to many different parishes - the reasons are not completely clear. He is a kind, warm, caring and committed priest who truly cares of this flock. He now lives in a village in rural Poland where he works with teenagers with behavioral problems who fight and yell abuse. He declines the advances of a young brunette named Ewa (Maja Ostaszewska) saying he is already spoken for: Ewa is the love reason Adam's associate teacher Michal (Lukasz Simlat) left the seminary and never became a priest. But celibacy is not the only reason for his rejection. Adam knows that he desires men and that his embrace of the priesthood has been a flight from his own sexuality. When he meets Lukasz (Mateusz Kosciukiewicz, the director's husband), the strange and tongue-tied son of a simple rural family, Adam's self-imposed abstinence becomes a heavy burden. He hears the confession of a teen who has had a same sex encounter elsewhere and when a new addition to the camp Adrian/Blondie (Tomasz Schuchardt), the lad is seduced by Blondie and the result is the lad's suicide by hanging. Lukasz sustains a beating and seeks Adam's solace and healing at night, and that innocent tender encounter is observed by Michal. The Bishop is alerted and Adam must leave for yet another assignment. He is followed by Lukasz and at last Adam's quandary is at least for the moment resolved.The film is rich in metaphorical scenes - a Skype call between Adam and his Toronto based sister shares Adam's desperate need to have someone to hug, Adam turns to drinking and in his altered state he drunkenly dances with a photograph of the Pope - his only allowed passion, a funeral scene for the fallen lad, and a mesmerizingly beautiful religious celebration parade full of overtones. The film may for some be too huge in character depth and audiences more attuned to action based movies it might be too slow and deep and fragmented. Were it not for the brilliance of Andrzej Chyra's Adam the film may even offend some. But the total experience of the film is deeply moving.

1667536,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B00EJUXNOM,J. Martin,"[5, 5]","This is a very effective, very positive and yet oddly disturbing movie about the fitful coming out of a 40ish gay priest in Poland. His name is Adam, and he looks nothing like a priest except while on duty. He's always known he's gay, but he's serious about his vocation and has stayed closeted in order to keep his vows of celibacy.He has a special gift for helping troubled teenage boys, which his superiors value greatly. His homosexuality has never led to anything remotely inappropriate with a boy (or with a man, for that matter), but he is periodically transferred in order to keep even rumors from interfering with his very valuable ministry. Most recently he was moved from Warsaw to an isolated rural parish with a small work-home for boys on furlough from reformatories.This is a complex movie, and trying to summarize its plot would be a disservice. It is not predictable, not typical of gay movies, of priest movies, or of any other sort of movies I can think of. It's not the story of a type of man but of THIS man. So, like any real human being, Adam is more complicated than a normal movie character, and the director does not try to make him easy to understand.In part because it's NOT predictable, this movie is fascinating to watch, and the end is especially satisfying. The movie is disturbing not because of anything that happens, but because everyone and everything in it looks dirty.I know that sounds superficial, but sometimes the most superficial things in life are the most distressing. Even after bathing, the characters look grimy, everything indoors is dingy, and outdoors is nothing but dust. I don't know if rural Poland really is as miserable as this movie makes it appear, or if the director was intentionally creating a disturbing ambiance for the movie.Although it's disturbing, that ambiance adds to the complexity of the movie and enhances its effectiveness.

A Polish film with English subtitles, it is the story of Father Adam, a Catholic priest who is stationed in rural Poland.  Among his duties is the counseling and supervision of a group of troubled teen boys who are on remand from the state reform school system.  Adam is a young man who came late to the Church and the priesthood, and he relates well to the teens and to the community.Father Adam himself is a deeply troubled individual, however.  He faces innumerable challenges dealing with the teenagers and with his other duties in the community, but those pale compared to his inner struggles.  He finds it easy to dismiss a woman who seeks a sexual relationship with him by telling her ""I'm taken,"" but it is far more difficult to deal with his feelings towards the young men with whom he works, especially an enigmatic new arrival named Lukasz.Father Adam's struggles are sympathetically told with respect for both him, the young woman, and the teens with whom he must deal.

This is the September, 2013 release in that on-going series.""In The Name Of..."" (2013 release from Poland; 102 min.) brings the story of Father Adam, a Catholic priest who has been transferred from a parish in Warsaw to a parish in the country-side of Poland, literally in the middle of nowhere. There he heads a center of troubled teenage boys, who will be sent back into the (presumably much harder) state system if they don't behave. Adam struggles with loneliness, as he takes confession after confession, but he himself has nowhere to turn with his troubles, other than the occasional contact with his faraway sister who lives in Toronto. Adam fends off the advances of a young woman Ewa, telling her that yes he finds her attractive but ""I'm already spoken for"". Then Adam strikes a bond with one of the troubles teens, a boy named Lukasz. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: this movie is a complex priesthood/troubled youth drama that addresses a lot of issues, none more so than the loneliness of Father Adam. At one point he is Skype-ing with his sister in Toronto when he is feeling desperate. He asks her ""Do you have someone to hug? I need someone I can hug"". The movie does a great job walking a thin line between true desperation and sheer overkill. The photography in the movie is outstanding, filming it in a sun-drenched way (sometimes reminding me of magic-realism). The acting is also superb, none more so that the Polish actor in the role of Father Adam. And any movie that finds a place for Band of Horses' ""The Funeral"" (in is pivotal moment of the movie, no less) gets extra brownie points. But wait! there is more!

He was moved on from a similar parish in Warsaw under a bit of a cloud. He works with Michal who dropped out of the Seminary for love - this love is Ewa who clearly has the hots for our Adam. Meanwhile he tries to do `good' by the boys who are an unruly bunch to say the least. Then a new boy turns up who is nicknamed `Blondie' - he is elf assured, striking and gay and about to upset the established order - after all `you do not confess to the priest but to God'.Meanwhile another one of the boys who is a bit of an outside and has the nickname `Humpty' seems to need a little more `spiritual guidance' than the other boys. Well the summer heat rises and so do the hormone levels. Adam is also seemingly fighting an alcohol problem; and it is not long before cracks in the fragile set up start to show. The consequences of what takes place will have repercussions for all those involved.This is a very gripping film throughout and it all unfolds at a rather slow pace, but it is hard to notice. I actually thought at one point that this is like watching a car crash in slow motion - but in a really good way. The scene shot in slow mo with the soundtrack of `Band of Horses' is particularly memorable and will make me listen to the album again. There are issues here that go beyond mere sexuality and as such this is a layered film that has repressed feelings and love at the very core of what it is doing,; I can absolutely recommend - especially for lovers of gay themed films.",4,"Polish, Priest Love Tale that is very good.",1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,1571,"['Priest', 'Adam', 'problem', 'boys/lads', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'programme', 'rural', 'Poland', 'was', 'moved', 'similar', 'parish', 'Warsaw', 'bit', 'cloud', 'Michal', 'who', 'dropped', 'Seminary', 'love', 'love', 'Ewa', 'who', 'clearly', 'hots', 'Adam', 'Meanwhile', 'do', 'good', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'unruly', 'bunch', 'say', 'least', 'Then', 'new', 'boy', 'up', 'who', 'nicknamed', 'Blondie', 'elf', 'assured', 'striking', 'gay', 'upset', 'established', 'order', 'do', 'not', 'confess', 'priest', ""God'.Meanwhile"", 'one', 'boys', 'who', 'bit', 'outside', 'nickname', 'Humpty', 'need', 'little', 'more', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'other', 'boys', 'Well', 'summer', 'heat', 'rises', 'so', 'do', 'hormone', 'levels', 'Adam', 'also', 'seemingly', 'fighting', 'alcohol', 'problem', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'cracks', 'fragile', 'set', 'up', 'start', 'show', 'consequences', 'what', 'place', 'will', 'have', 'repercussions', 'involved.This', 'very', 'gripping', 'film', 'unfolds', 'rather', 'slow', 'pace', 'hard', 'notice', 'actually', 'thought', 'one', 'point', 'watching', 'car', 'crash', 'slow', 'motion', 'really', 'good', 'way', 'scene', 'shot', 'slow', 'mo', 'soundtrack', 'Band', 'Horses', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'will', 'make', 'listen', 'album', 'again', 'are', 'issues', 'here', 'go', 'mere', 'sexuality', 'such', 'layered', 'film', 'repressed', 'feelings', 'love', 'very', 'core', 'what', 'doing', 'can', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'especially', 'lovers', 'gay', 'themed', 'films']",In the Name Of
