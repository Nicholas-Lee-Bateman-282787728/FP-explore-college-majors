My trepidation won at on that one. Branaugh is all wrong for the character. It should have been played by Bian Cox. Branaugh is too healthy and way over the top; and the tone of the series is so bland, typified by the weathercaster delivery of the actress playing his daughter. Therefore, after reading the reviews for the Swedish version, I took the plunge and was joyfully surprised. I cannot say enough about the integrity of this series. THe direction and tone of the shows are pitch perfect, and the acting leaves me breathless.
