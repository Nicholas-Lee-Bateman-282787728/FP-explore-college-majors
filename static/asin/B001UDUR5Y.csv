I have seen him live and this DVD really captures the majority of the best part of his acts. Definitely has replay value.,5,Too Funny!,1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,229,"['Caparulo', 'hilarious', 'part', 'new', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'crew', 'great', 'bits', 'very', 'entertaining', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'DVD', 'really', 'majority', 'best', 'part', 'acts', 'Definitely', 'replay', 'value']",Meet Cap
1238767,AFCVMO0XR1D8J,B001UDUR5Y,Jamie L,"[2, 2]","I think John Caparulo is hilarious and this is a great DVD of his. His act will keep you laughing over and over. Though I feel I should mention some people may end up offended by some of what he says. He's definitely not the most extreme comedian I've ever heard, but he does quite a bit of swearing. This is a must see if you are a stand-up fan. My favorite part of this whole act though, is the road rage section. Once you watch it you will know what I mean (especially if you have road rage).",5,Hilarious,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,495,"['think', 'John', 'Caparulo', 'hilarious', 'great', 'DVD', 'act', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'over', 'feel', 'should', 'mention', 'people', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'offended', 'what', 'definitely', 'not', 'most', 'extreme', 'comedian', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'quite', 'bit', 'swearing', 'must', 'see', 'are', 'stand-up', 'fan', 'favorite', 'part', 'whole', 'act', 'road', 'rage', 'section', 'watch', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'especially', 'have', 'road', 'rage']",Meet Cap
