Plenty of film clips,  including classic performances from ""The Ed Sullivan  Show"" and Presley's own TV specials track the singer's explosive assault on  the consciousness of his times, and the tragic end that, with hindsight,  seemed almost inevitable.  The film is marred a bit by an unnecessary  narration with singer Ronnie McDowell as a less than convincing Elvis, and  by the inclusion of some dramatic reenactments of key events in Presley's  life.  None of these embellishments contribute much to this otherwise  superb documentary, but nor do they detract from the miles of authentic  footage of the King in all his glory, and, sadly, his defeat at the hands  of his own self-destructive impulses.",5,The real Elvis,928454400,"06 4, 1999",1999,1002,"['Love', 'loathe', 'genius', 'joke', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'was', 'single', 'most', 'influential', 'beloved', 'performer', 'second', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'Elvis', 'excellent', 'job', 'depicting', 'rise', 'fall', 'immensely', 'gifted', 'controversial', 'performer', 'Plenty', 'film', 'clips', 'including', 'classic', 'performances', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Show', 'Presley', 'own', 'TV', 'specials', 'track', 'singer', 'explosive', 'assault', 'consciousness', 'times', 'tragic', 'end', 'hindsight', 'seemed', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'film', 'marred', 'bit', 'unnecessary', 'narration', 'singer', 'Ronnie', 'McDowell', 'less', 'convincing', 'Elvis', 'inclusion', 'dramatic', 'reenactments', 'key', 'events', 'Presley', 'life', 'None', 'embellishments', 'contribute', 'much', 'otherwise', 'superb', 'documentary', 'do', 'detract', 'miles', 'authentic', 'footage', 'King', 'glory', 'sadly', 'defeat', 'hands', 'own', 'self-destructive', 'impulses']",N/A
234631,A1BMQA5PIZKU1P,6300269396,"Bryan ""Dragonboots""","[40, 42]","A must own DVD for every Elvis fan.  I'm glad to see both versions are included.  I first saw this on HBO in the early 80's when I was a kid and remembered almost all of it.  I was surprised to find, years later, that they changed it for the VHS version.The most notable changes between the 2 versions are: In the newer version there is, obviously,  a lot more performance footage.  But there is also a censored remark that Elvis made about a groupie during the 'Promised Land' montage.  His voice is overdubbed by a guy that sounds like him saying 'she could raise the dead'.  You can see the difference by playing the 80's version after watching the newer version.  Also, the ending is different.  In the older version, Elvis sings 'Are You Lonesome Tonight?' and 'My Way' on the newer version they take out 'Lonesome' and replace it with 'Love Me' in which you get to see him do his whole scarf thing that he passes out to the screaming women in the audience.  The change defeats the whole purpose of the thing - which is to watch it and feel sad at how much he's messing up ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" on stage(it is mentioned that the show was performed 6 weeks before he died).  But the man can still sing, even during his weakened state.  Strange how they edited his comment on stage: When he said ""If you think I'm nervous... your right"", on one version they cut to the crowd cheering and clapping yet on the other version, they show a quiet bewiledered audience.  The kind where you would hear crickets chirping.  That just doesn't make sense and it seeems like the editors wanted to make Elvis look even worse with the quiet audience.The documentary ends with 'American Trilogy' and shows the funeral procession and then cuts to Elvis singing 'hush little baby don't you cry/you know your daddy's bound to die', a really sad moment.  I don't see how anyone watching this cannot be affected by the last 10 minutes of this.A must buy for Elvis fans or for fans who are not as familiar with his 25 year career.  It covers pretty much everything as far as I can tell.  You get to see backstage moments, car rides where Elvis doesn't realise there are mics in the car and they tell him, a montage of clips from his movies, his bodyguards releasing a tell-all book months before his death, karate classes, home movies, press conferences, and you get to see the upstairs area of the real Graceland during the first few minutes of the movie(an actor portrayed him walking up the stairs and into his room).So if you like Elvis then you should definitely buy this.  Reasonably priced and it has a lot of music from his entire career.  The only bonus feature is a 9-minute video about Graceland by Joe Espisito but they barely go inside the mansion and instead talk about the horses, his cars, the raquetball court and other things on the property.  It looks to maybe have been made in the late 70's or early 80's because it has that 'old video' look(as I call it).  This DVD will remind you about what could've been if Elvis had done things differently and survived.Elvis has left the building.",5,Thankyouthankyouverymuch Warner Bros!,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,3094,"['must', 'own', 'DVD', 'Elvis', 'fan', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'versions', 'are', 'included', 'first', 'saw', 'HBO', 'early', '80', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'remembered', 'almost', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'years', 'later', 'changed', 'VHS', 'version.The', 'most', 'notable', 'changes', '2', 'versions', 'are', 'newer', 'version', 'obviously', 'lot', 'more', 'performance', 'footage', 'also', 'censored', 'remark', 'Elvis', 'made', 'groupie', ""'Promised"", 'Land', 'montage', 'voice', 'overdubbed', 'guy', 'saying', ""'she"", 'could', 'raise', 'dead', 'can', 'see', 'difference', 'playing', '80', 'version', 'watching', 'newer', 'version', 'Also', 'ending', 'different', 'older', 'version', 'Elvis', 'sings', 'Lonesome', 'Tonight', ""'My"", 'Way', 'newer', 'version', 'take', 'out', ""'Lonesome"", 'replace', 'Me', 'get', 'see', 'do', 'whole', 'scarf', 'thing', 'out', 'screaming', 'women', 'audience', 'change', 'whole', 'purpose', 'thing', 'watch', 'feel', 'sad', 'how', 'much', 'messing', 'up', 'Are', 'Lonesome', 'Tonight', 'stage', 'mentioned', 'show', 'was', 'performed', '6', 'weeks', 'died', 'man', 'can', 'still', 'sing', 'even', 'weakened', 'state', 'Strange', 'how', 'edited', 'comment', 'stage', 'When', 'said', 'think', ""'m"", 'nervous', 'right', 'one', 'version', 'cut', 'crowd', 'cheering', 'clapping', 'yet', 'other', 'version', 'show', 'quiet', 'bewiledered', 'audience', 'kind', 'where', 'would', 'hear', 'crickets', 'chirping', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'editors', 'wanted', 'make', 'Elvis', 'look', 'even', 'worse', 'quiet', 'audience.The', 'documentary', 'ends', ""'American"", 'Trilogy', 'funeral', 'procession', 'then', 'cuts', 'Elvis', 'singing', ""'hush"", 'little', 'baby', 'do', ""n't"", 'cry/you', 'know', 'daddy', 'bound', 'die', 'really', 'sad', 'moment', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'watching', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'affected', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'this.A', 'must', 'buy', 'Elvis', 'fans', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', '25', 'year', 'career', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'get', 'see', 'backstage', 'moments', 'car', 'rides', 'where', 'Elvis', ""n't"", 'realise', 'are', 'mics', 'car', 'tell', 'montage', 'clips', 'movies', 'bodyguards', 'releasing', 'tell-all', 'book', 'months', 'death', 'karate', 'classes', 'home', 'movies', 'press', 'conferences', 'get', 'see', 'upstairs', 'area', 'real', 'Graceland', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'actor', 'portrayed', 'walking', 'up', 'stairs', 'room', '.So', 'like', 'Elvis', 'then', 'should', 'definitely', 'buy', 'Reasonably', 'priced', 'lot', 'music', 'entire', 'career', 'only', 'bonus', 'feature', '9-minute', 'video', 'Graceland', 'Joe', 'Espisito', 'barely', 'go', 'mansion', 'instead', 'talk', 'horses', 'cars', 'raquetball', 'court', 'other', 'things', 'property', 'maybe', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'late', '70', 'early', '80', 'video', 'look', 'call', 'DVD', 'will', 'remind', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Elvis', 'had', 'done', 'things', 'differently', 'survived.Elvis', 'left', 'building']",N/A

Also the theatracial verson, in the 1977 concert, had the version of Are You Lonesome Tonight, where Elvis fouls up the spoken part of the song saying plus tax etc. In the home version, it is replaced with Love Me.Thanks to The Elvis Presley Estate for finally releasing this on DVD.

""This is Elvis""? Well, yes, up to a point. It's made with the approval and cooperation of the Prestley estate so it's either good or bad according to your taste. Taste not being something you neccessarily associate with Elvis. The spectrum must have been invented to describe his life. In this polite history of the man you won't be seeing the footage where the King appologies to a television reporter over his tardiness due to a dam making mammal. In fact, Elvis appears to be speaking to us from beyond the grave (allegedly) and invites us to share his hurtin'. His wife, for instance, hurt him by asking for a divorce. This unreasonable request was due to his touring and not what he was doing while touring which the big E mysteriously forgets to mention. Obviously, he's hurtin' too much to speak. Later his bodyguards write an expose after being sacked by phone by a subordinate after 16 years service with only a weeks severence pay. Curiously, despite being told this possible understandable grievance, Elvis is oblivious to their hurtin' and tells us that it's he whose hurtin'. There's a whole lot of hurtin' going on. Maybe if he had a few ladies round Graceland once in a while they wouldn't have all been so miserable. The only person not hurtin' Elvis, apparently, is The Beatles whom he welcomes to the US by phone. No mention of the fact that he called them a menace to America's youth and had a fireside chat with Nixon on the subject and *gulp* drugs. Ayluvis is hurtin' so much it's time to do some hurtin' of his own and we are subjected to a protracted and baffling display of his Kung Fu skills which seem to last half the remaining picture. Careful Elvis, you don't want to try that while being tardy with a dam making mammal. Then you'll REALLY be hurtin'. (I've waited years to say ""careful, Elvis!"" Just like that TV reporter warning Elvis that the mike was on while reporting his tardiness due to a dam making mammal. Hey, at least I ain't hurtin'.) Soon everythings hurtin' Elvis and he's helped on stage by his minders in Las Vegas. This section is very poignant as Elvis seems to be far from dispondent and has a winning sense of humour about his decline while forgetting the words to Love Me Tender. Okay, he died young but who wants to be an old f**t anyway? When you hit forty you become invisible and have trouble climbing the stairs. So I've heard. Life is short and this ending is powerful and majestic, even. Now I'm hurtin'. The whole world's hurtin'. This film has renewed my dread of dieing on the John like Elvis middle-name Presley.

Still he sings a good verison of My Way.This DVD set will include the original Theactral version from 1981, and the version that has been on VHS that had more footage. As noted in a review, Elvis does make some off color remark to his friends about a woman he had been with the night before, in the home verison, Ral Donner overdubed something less off color. Also the theatracial verson, in the 1977 concert, had the version of Are You Lonesome Tonight, where Elvis fouls up the spoken part of the song saying plus tax etc. In the home version, it is replaced with Love Me.Thanks to The Elvis Presley Estate for finally releasing this on DVD.

234643,A3NHLPQXWULJXR,6300269396,Joe O'Brien,"[47, 51]","I first saw ""This is Elvis"" in the theatre when it first came  out in the late summer of 1981.I decided to go see it after reading a  several page layout about it in Rolling Stone and after watching  ""Siskel&Ebert;"" give the movie a good review on their  show(back when they were on PBS).Gene Siskel said that even people who  weren't fans of Elvis Presley may enjoy the movie. I've been a fan of Elvis  for well over 20 years.Have more than 40 of his albums(on vinyl, not the  CDs)some have even become collector items since then.I must say that I  enjoyed this biography very much.Even went back to see again a couple of  months later with some other family members.This was the first bio that was  given the blessing of the Elvis Presley estate and certain members of the  so called ""Memphis Mafia"" and Colonel Tom Parker were technical  consultants on the picture.This was the first time anyone was permitted to  film inside Graceland.This was a few years before it became open to the  public.The film was produced by David L.Wolper(who produced the mini series  ""Roots"") and directed by Andrew Solt and Malcolm Leo(who made  documentaries on Marilyn Monroe,The Beach Boys, the very good theatrical  bio ""Imagine-John Lennon"" from 1988,and ""The Best of Ed  Sullivan"" specials for network television).The producers were allowed  to use actual home movies and never before seen footage.The  highlights:Elvis' first TV appearances in 1956,scenes from his most popular  movies,""Love Me Tender"",""Loving You"" and  ""Jailhouse Rock"", his first TV appearance after being discharged  from the U.S.Army in 1960 on a Frank Sinatra special and newsreel footage  from news conferences in 1960 and 1972.And,the home video version includes  45 min. of footage not seen in the theatre version.The lowlights: the  awkward dramatic recreations of Elvis'early life by various actors,and the  narration(like it was from beyond the grave)by singer and Elvis' sound  alike Ral Donner. And,narration by other actors portraying Elvis'  mother,and Priscilla,etc.And,the sound quality isn't great because the  video isn't in Dolby Stereo like it was in the theatre.And,the video  version deleted two memorable scences from the original theatre version.One  scene in the'70's where Elvis was riding with some of his buddies in a limo  with a hidden camera on him.This scene was the reason the movie was rated  PG instead of G.Another scene was a live performance in 1977 only two months before his death.I've had this video since the late '80's on  Beta(which I regret now because Beta is practically extinct,even though the  picture quality is very good.It's become Super-Beta now and I hear TV news  crews still prefer Super-Beta over Super-VHS).Some of my  family and me took a 500 mile road trip to Memphis in 1996 to see  Graceland.Spent 5 hours taking the entire tour.We enjoyed it very much.Warner Home Video released ""This is Elvis"" in a special edition 2 DVD set in 2007 in Dolby Digital and they restore the deleted scenes.I'm delighted.And for Elvis fans a few things that have come  to light since this bio.The singer Ral Donner(the narrator) wasn't and  actual Elvis impersonator.Mr. Donner was a popular singer in the '50's and  '60's. He met an untimely death back in the early '80's. Also,sadly the  actor David Scott who portrayed Elvis as a teenager died from a suicide  back in the early '90's. When Elvis died there were about 150 Elvis impersonators around. Today there is approx.250,000! Also,Elvis said in  an interview that his favorite impersonator was the comedian Andy Kaufman.Elvis thought Kaufman did the best impression of him.And this from  a bio in Reader's Digest,Elvis' hair was a sandy blonde and it turned  prematurely gray(like his father's)so he had it dyed jet black and he kept  it that way.Elvis's hairdresser said when Elvis was in his forties his hair  was actually completely white.And,this from an interview with Elvis'  lifelong friend and member of the ""Memphis Mafia"" Joe Espisito,he  revealed that Elvis' had plastic surgery on his nose.Something Elvis kept  secret.And, sometime after Elvis' daughter Lisa Marie married Michael  Jackson in 1994 there was an earthquake in Memphis,about 5 on the Richter  scale.They found out later it was just Elvis spinning in his grave.That was  from Jay Leno on The Tonight Show. Thang ya.Thang ya verruh mush.(That  isn't a typo, that's how you enunciate it).",4,True blue fans of Elvis Presley will enjoy this biography,966470400,"08 17, 2000",2000,4422,"['first', 'saw', 'Elvis', 'theatre', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'late', 'summer', '1981.I', 'decided', 'go', 'see', 'reading', 'several', 'page', 'layout', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'watching', 'Siskel', 'Ebert', 'give', 'movie', 'good', 'review', 'show', 'back', 'when', 'were', 'PBS', '.Gene', 'Siskel', 'said', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'fans', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'may', 'enjoy', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Elvis', 'well', '20', 'years.Have', 'more', '40', 'albums', 'vinyl', 'not', 'CDs', 'have', 'even', 'become', 'collector', 'items', 'then.I', 'must', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'biography', 'very', 'much.Even', 'went', 'back', 'see', 'again', 'couple', 'months', 'later', 'other', 'family', 'members.This', 'was', 'first', 'bio', 'was', 'given', 'blessing', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'estate', 'certain', 'members', 'so', 'called', 'Memphis', 'Mafia', 'Colonel', 'Tom', 'Parker', 'were', 'technical', 'consultants', 'picture.This', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'anyone', 'was', 'permitted', 'film', 'Graceland.This', 'was', 'few', 'years', 'became', 'open', 'public.The', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'David', 'L.Wolper', 'who', 'produced', 'mini', 'series', 'Roots', 'directed', 'Andrew', 'Solt', 'Malcolm', 'Leo', 'who', 'made', 'documentaries', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'very', 'good', 'theatrical', 'bio', 'Imagine-John', 'Lennon', '1988', 'Best', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'specials', 'network', 'television', 'producers', 'were', 'allowed', 'use', 'actual', 'home', 'movies', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'footage.The', 'highlights', 'Elvis', 'first', 'TV', 'appearances', '1956', 'scenes', 'most', 'popular', 'movies', 'Love', 'Me', 'Tender', 'Loving', 'Jailhouse', 'Rock', 'first', 'TV', 'appearance', 'being', 'discharged', 'U.S.Army', '1960', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'special', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'news', 'conferences', '1960', '1972.And', 'home', 'video', 'version', '45', 'min', 'footage', 'not', 'seen', 'theatre', 'version.The', 'lowlights', 'awkward', 'dramatic', 'recreations', ""Elvis'early"", 'life', 'various', 'actors', 'narration', 'was', 'grave', 'singer', 'Elvis', 'sound', 'Ral', 'Donner', 'narration', 'other', 'actors', 'portraying', 'Elvis', 'mother', 'Priscilla', 'etc.And', 'sound', 'quality', ""n't"", 'great', 'video', ""n't"", 'Dolby', 'Stereo', 'was', 'theatre.And', 'video', 'version', 'deleted', 'two', 'memorable', 'scences', 'original', 'theatre', 'version.One', 'scene', ""the'70"", 'where', 'Elvis', 'was', 'riding', 'buddies', 'limo', 'hidden', 'camera', 'him.This', 'scene', 'was', 'reason', 'movie', 'was', 'rated', 'PG', 'instead', 'G.Another', 'scene', 'was', 'live', 'performance', '1977', 'only', 'two', 'months', 'death.I', ""'ve"", 'had', 'video', 'late', ""'80"", 'Beta', 'regret', 'now', 'Beta', 'practically', 'extinct', 'even', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good.It', 'become', 'Super-Beta', 'now', 'hear', 'TV', 'news', 'crews', 'still', 'prefer', 'Super-Beta', 'Super-VHS', '.Some', 'family', 'took', '500', 'mile', 'road', 'trip', 'Memphis', '1996', 'see', 'Graceland.Spent', '5', 'hours', 'taking', 'entire', 'tour.We', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much.Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'released', 'Elvis', 'special', 'edition', '2', 'DVD', 'set', '2007', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'restore', 'deleted', 'scenes.I', ""'m"", 'delighted.And', 'Elvis', 'fans', 'few', 'things', 'have', 'come', 'light', 'bio.The', 'singer', 'Ral', 'Donner', 'narrator', 'was', ""n't"", 'actual', 'Elvis', 'impersonator.Mr', 'Donner', 'was', 'popular', 'singer', ""'50"", ""'60"", 'met', 'untimely', 'death', 'back', 'early', ""'80"", 'Also', 'sadly', 'actor', 'David', 'Scott', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Elvis', 'teenager', 'died', 'suicide', 'back', 'early', ""'90"", 'When', 'Elvis', 'died', 'were', '150', 'Elvis', 'impersonators', 'Today', 'approx.250,000', 'Also', 'Elvis', 'said', 'interview', 'favorite', 'impersonator', 'was', 'comedian', 'Andy', 'Kaufman.Elvis', 'thought', 'Kaufman', 'did', 'best', 'impression', 'him.And', 'bio', 'Reader', 'Digest', 'Elvis', 'hair', 'was', 'sandy', 'blonde', 'turned', 'prematurely', 'gray', 'father', 'had', 'dyed', 'jet', 'black', 'kept', 'way.Elvis', 'hairdresser', 'said', 'when', 'Elvis', 'was', 'forties', 'hair', 'was', 'actually', 'completely', 'white.And', 'interview', 'Elvis', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'member', 'Memphis', 'Mafia', 'Joe', 'Espisito', 'revealed', 'Elvis', 'had', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'nose.Something', 'Elvis', 'kept', 'secret.And', 'sometime', 'Elvis', 'daughter', 'Lisa', 'Marie', 'married', 'Michael', 'Jackson', '1994', 'was', 'earthquake', 'Memphis', 'about', '5', 'Richter', 'scale.They', 'found', 'out', 'later', 'was', 'just', 'Elvis', 'spinning', 'grave.That', 'was', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'Thang', 'ya.Thang', 'ya', 'verruh', 'mush', ""n't"", 'typo', 'how', 'enunciate']",N/A
234644,AH7RCT68TO3E9,6300269396,John S,"[5, 5]","Believe it or not, but my first exposure to Elvis Presley's live footage was his performance of 'Are You Lonesome Tonight?' from 'This Is Elvis'. I was deeply disappointed when I got hold of the VHS 'This Is Elvis' and found out that the lively 'Are You Lonesome Tonight' was replaced with the funeral 'Love Me'. Copyright issue? Who knows. But this 2-disc edition shoots 2 birds with one stone, giving us the VHS version and the original theatrical edit. To put it simple: if you want to have a video biography of Elvis Presley, this is the one.PROS:1. This is so far the only authorized video biography of Elvis Presley and most elaborated. From Tupelo to 'What Happened Elvis?'. Tons of archive footage were excavated and when there was no footage, for natural reasons (depicting the adolescence, death, etc.), there was an actor's play. The result is a seamless video sequence with a narration by... not Elvis himself, but by an impersonator who says ""what"" the real Elvis ""would have"" narrated (in fact, for many years I thought it was really Elvis narrating his own story in connection with his CBS Special in 1977!). 2. The film places Elvis in the context of his time with a lot of curious newsreel footage (anti-rock'n'roll statements by the ultra-conservatives, sneaking into Baptist Memorial Hospital where Elvis was hospitalized in 1973, Elvis' karate practices, 'What happened, Elvis?' 1977 interview, etc.), which more than anything hints at the professional level and investment that was put into the movie that distinguishes it from amateur, semi-professional, quick-buck rip-offs that come and go every other month and for which a casual fan lost a count.CONS:1. The main consultants for the movie were Col. Parker and Joe Esposito. It's plainly lame for them to have ""Elvis"" beyond the grave narrate how they were real helpers to him. C'mon, guys, you should have had more dignity and should have left it out for your own personal accounts. 2. Some serious gaps in biography of the man. For example, aside from the recording of 'That's All Right Mama', the years 1954-55 weren't covered at all. The Hollywood period (1960-68) was rushed through within 10 mins (no mentioning of 'Viva Las Vegas' or 'Change of Habit'). On the other hand, the army period is overexposed. 3. The DVD still has a typical Col Parker trick: a sticker advertizing a ""free"" (sic) 24-page booklet which turns out to be a mostly black & white wastepaper. So Tom Parker.It's a shame that since 1981 there hasn't been a fresher, deeper official biography on Presley, especially when so much new video footage and information can be found here and there (like we all can see amazing videos on YouTube). We only have 'The Greatest Performances' (1991) & 'Presley by The Presleys' (2005) but these, although exposing new footage and stories, serve their own purposes and don't give us a full multi-dimentional and rich biography to replace 'This Is Elvis'.

234648,A1HACP80YXJRPP,6300269396,Mateo,"[1, 1]","As an Elvis worshipper and musician, I rate this video five stars. Among all of the documentaries on Elvis, this video is unique for its emphasis on actual performance footage and outstanding performances rather than hackneyed, misinformed, or irrelevant commentary/opinions on Elvis by Elvis experts/friends/family. I urge fans--especially newer fans--to check out this video for its singularly coherent and complete overview of the art of Elvis.As an Elvis worshipper with an interest in history, on the other hand, I rate the video four stars. The art of Elvis does not tell the whole Elvis story. While the video does reference a bit of the biographical and cultural context of Elvis's early years, the video disregards almost completely the tragic decline and demise of Elvis. Ironically, by perpetuating the historical tradition of not dealing with Elvis's end, the video serves as an unexpected historical document in its own right.In conclusion, this video is an artistically satisfying but historically incomplete account of Elvis Presley.

Well produced, there are film clips of Elvis through the years, along with some re-creations that look like the real thing. Even along with the jiggle of the camera looks like some scenes were really shot with the old Bell and Howell Home Movie cameras. It covers his entire life, with his early poor years leading to the Sun Records especially fascinating. The voice is done by Ral Donner, an excellent Elvis voice, it sounds just like him. What I came away with this was that Elvis was a genuinely fine young man, whose fame and fortune turned him into a paranoid recluse. During the 60's and especially the 70's, many rock stars acted rude and condescending, like 25 year old know-it-alls and prima donnas. Elvis was never that way. It's amazing to see how he always had the time for his fans, even when there were mobs. There are scenes of him rising to the top on RCA, in the army, his mama, Col. Parker cutting deals, his movies, recordings, and early TV appearances on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivam shows, and near the end, when a sad fat Elvis still sang his heart out to his devoted fans and of course it covers all his lady loves. The extras are nice, but this movie is the best I've ever seen on Elvis' life and I've been a fan since 1956.

I've collected a few DVD's based on the stories of music legends.  After I've bought ""Great Balls of Fire"" with Dennis Quaid playing Jerry Lee Lewis, ""La Bamba"" with Lou Diamond Phillips playing Richie Valens, ""Salena"" with Jennifer Lopez playing Selena, and ""Ray"" with Jamie Foxx playing Ray Charles, I just couldn't wait for them to finally release this DVD of ""This is Elvis"". However, this is not a film with some actor playing Elvis.  This is a true documentary of the history of Elvis.  In the beginning of the film, they use a child star to show Elvis when he was a little boy.  And the narrator who actually sounds like Elvis talking about himself, is actually the singer named Ral Donner, who back in 1961, had a hit called ""You Don't Know What You've Got (Til You Lose it)"" which also sounds just like Elvis Presley.Everybody loves Elvis.  From the filthiest of trailer park trash to the most devious and wealthiest of political leaders, Elvis was in everyone heart.  Elvis' story is the most inspiring of all stories of what shaped the direction of music and rock and roll.This DVD package comes with two DVD's.  This first one is the original 1981 theatrical version in widescreen and 2.0 stereo.  The second DVD is the 1983 release with an additional 40 minutes of added footage.  However, it is in full screen with a reduced video quality and it's recorded in mono.  Plus, some censorship was applied to make it more TV friendly.  Some things Elvis said had to be altered to be a little less offensive.Well, now that this DVD has been released, I hope that the soundtrack will be released too.  I like having the songs and the various snippets of dialogue that was in the film.  I had the cassette tape for many years (til I wore it to death).Well, now I've only got about 3 more films that I'm waiting for on DVD.

I'm pleased to report that this video is most decidedly not utter rubbish.  At over 140 minutes of run time it is chockablock full of enough Elvis material to make any Elvis fan happy.The premise of this video is to document the life of the 'King' from childhood to overnight sensationalia through military, marriage and moviestardom and finally to decline and ultimate demise.  The director's conceit is to use actors to portray phases of his life as a set up for the plot and then to use actual film footage of subsequent events to flesh out the story.  In addition, we are guided by narrations from 'Elvis,' 'Priscilla,' his 'Mom' and others all with suitably hill billy accents, where appropriate.  In my opinion this departure from straight documentary hurts the film and I found my mind wandering from bits because they seemed bothersome and artificial.  In addition, I believe that the story was poorly told in any event because the video comprised more than two hours of material (some of which was not on the big screen release), and still did an inadequate job of covering many of the many issues the story raised.  For instance, we are shown a gathering of Elvis impersonators and Teddy Boys in Liverpool England which, apart from the spectacle, had absolutely nothing to do with the film.  It was almost as if someone wanted to do a section on the spawn of Elvis kitsch, clubs, and impersonators but then begged off, and forgot to cut this clip.  Also, a section is given over to a revelatory book written by his former body guards and mention is made of law suits, but with no other information.  Now, these visual and audio clues might be enough to inform an Elvis fan, but it leaves one such as I who knows little about Elvis clueless.  It is possible that since this film depended upon cooperation from the Elvis estate the director was unable to do more, I wonder?On the plus side is the large amount of film footage of early Elvis performances, his hollywood numbers and interviews he gave and shows he put on.  Especially nice are the interviews because they seem to allow one to observe Elvis form honest responses to unexpected questions; answers which often make him seem to be a really thoughtful and intelligent human being.  The early performances are, of course, riveting and alone would make the video worth owning.One walks away from this video thinking that it would have been much improved by extracting the faked bits and adding more actual film footage of Elvis.
