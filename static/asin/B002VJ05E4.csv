1293322,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B002VJ05E4,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Season Nine is far away the worst season yet of the series. It's just maintenance and more maintenance in every single one of 26 episodes (too many already). The series is running on steam, and there is no gas left in the tank. There is nothing original in any of the stories: it's all recycled junk, rehashing the same issues for the third, fourth, fifth, etc. time. The well is extremely dry. They reused the same clips that were 5 to 9 years old, and I saw a couple of Las Vegas that looked like it was shot in the 70s. Even in the end, Kelly became a target for rape for the third time in nine season. Oh come on! Something original please... Dylan relapses from drugs for the upteenth time! This is getting really old.... David is still the same talentless loser we all know and has nothing useful to add to the show. Just let him get killed, please... At least, they decided to kick Jason Priestley and Tiffani Amber-Thiessan off the show. Good riddance...long overdue. Let's go to each of the characters:Brandon Walsh- I'm so sick of him. He was so annoying post-breakup with Kelly that his character became so pathetic to watch. Jason Priestley explained why he left the show, and it was because ""playing Brandon Walsh was a career prison and he believes that he's been typecast as Brandon which has cost him roles in movies."" Ha, that's a laugh. Let's save ourselves the suspense: he had no talent whatsoever to make into the movies, and this was apparent during the 90s. Good riddance.Kelly Taylor- She had become unlikable during Season Nine because she got selfish in some episodes. So, I am neutral with her. The ending reminded me of how much she went through the last 8 seasons. Still, a tolerable character regardless.Steve Sanders- What really happened to him? He was completely changed after he graduated from high school. The more I see him in each episode, the more of a bonehead he is (and a literally unlikable one at that). He was a way better character during high school seasons, and now, he just flat out sucks. The thought of him running a newspaper business had my eyes rolling all the time.Donna Martin- A big part of why Season Nine sucked so much is because of Donna. The show had become ""Donna, Donna, Donna"" all the time that she should've gotten a sitcom of her own, a one that no one will watch. What a stupid character. The worst part of it all, she ends up being with great looking guys whom they share virtually zero chemistry, and we all know in real life that she has no chance of making it a reality because of her hideous hair color. I can't even see her running a business, much less designing clothes. She has way too much free time on her hands, and her shop keeps closing all the time due to personal reasons. Hard to believe that it is still alive in Beverly Hills. Too much manipulation going on.David Silver- Speaking of hair color, what was that on his head? It looked like his was doused heavily in a bowl of black shoe polish. I thought his reaction to Gina and Dylan on the same bed in final episode to be the funniest ever of the series. It was just so stupid because look at David...the guy is practically a moron and yet he gets women easily? I don't think so, buddy. Too much character manipulation going on here. Plus, he likes to control his women; otherwise, it isn't going to work out. He should have been killed, and that would be a great jumpstart to the series' pulse.Dylan McKay- The prodigal pseudointellectual returns! Speaking of pulse, the moment he showed up first time, the show just instantly came alive. Then, as soon as he relapsed with drugs, it died for good. It's just the same old story. Ditto with his Kelly dilemma. Like I care...plus Kelly said it best that Dylan is the most self-centered person on earth (still the best line of the show). By the way, what is Dylan doing, drinking socially? Was he supposed to be an alcoholic? I notice so much drinking of various alcoholic beverages constantly throughout the season, and they all look stupid doing it.Matt Durning- He seems like a nice guy, but let's face it, he should have stayed away from Kelly because with her comes with her gang of friends (*shudders* too clique). He was so weak that he gave Kelly so many chances. I started to dislike Kelly more when she tried to control him based on how he should do his job and what type of cases to take. It was pretty hypocritical of her. Then, again, all of the characters of the show were 100% pure hypocrites.Noah Hunter- Noah finally uttered the forbidden word, hypocrite, during Season 9 to Donna. And you know what? That should have been expanded more right there. When he isn't drunk, he is boring. When he is drunk, he is pathetic and untrusted. In short, Noah is Dylan McKay, version 2.0, but boring. Simple as that. And absolutely no chemistry with Donna. I don't even know why he bothers with her or stays in Beverly Hills either with her friends. He could do so much better than that.Valerie Malone- Smartest decision the makers made was cutting her loose because she drained all of the energy out of the show. Good riddance, big time.Gina Kincaid- She is Valerie Malone, version 2.0. She is absolutely unlikable and one of the most worthless characters on the show. Why bother having her around? Or even better, why bother being around with the group? Her being with Dylan...huh? I am still wearing my glasses, and I can't even see a speck of a connection between the two.Janet Sosna- Pretty, yes. And...that's it. (FYI: she isn't Japanese, but Korean. Couldn't they make that a fact instead?)Nat Bussichio- Uh....what's the point? He is only there for a few seconds per episode, and that's it. Why even bother having him in the opening credits? And what's with Luke Perry getting the Special Guest Star treatment? His presence in every episode had always overshadowed everybody's. In fact, he was literally the show because he made things interesting most of the time.I've survived nine season of complete, pure nonsense (everybody on that show is too implausibly good-looking no matter what time of the day or night, and no matter how bad things are, they always recover from it at an amazing speed, or nothing bad will ever happen to them, further ruining the credibility of the show). And finally...one more season to go, and my Beverly Hills 90210 hell will be all over!",2,Worst Season Yet.

Let's hope season 10 will satisfy me (both serie and DVD quality).",4,Better than season 9.,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,643,"['better', 'previous', 'season', 'still', 'not', 'enough', 'please', 'season', 'major', 'cliffhanger', 'Newcomer', 'Gina', 'OK', 'Dylan', 'McKay', 'became', 'real', 'joke', 'worst', 'season', '5', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'No', 'need', 'mention', 'music', 'still', 'bad', 'even', 'horrible', 'might', 'add', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'songs', 'voice', 'lyrics', 'anymore', 'just', 'elevator', 'music', 'used', 'several', 'times', 'whole', 'season', 'maybe', '4', '5', 'are', 'real', 'songs', 'thank', 'god', 'kept', 'one', 'two', 'musical', 'guests', 'original', 'airings', 'Let', 'hope', 'season', '10', 'will', 'satisfy', 'serie', 'DVD', 'quality']","Beverly Hills, 90210: Season 9"

This was a lot like the singers for Black Sabbath, you really needed to keep a score card to see who was in, and out. First in Episode 5, Brandon leaves, who was a pivetal character in the show. Actually he was the last of the original cast that the show was suppose to revolve around. First went Brenda(which most didn't care), then the parents, now Brandon. So moving on this season also saw the departure of the evil, seductive beauty, Valerie, which was also dissapointing. In her place came the beautiful but not quite as fitting, Vanessa Marcil. Then as soon as Brandon left, Dylan comes back, but for some odd reason is only considred a special ""guest star"" in the show. I'm not sure why because he's in every episode. I think they brought him back because the only original cast without him are, Donna, Kelly, David and Steve, which definitely were not enough to carry the show, and it's weight. The episodes are pretty good, a few interesting twists, mainly because of Dylan(Luke Perry), but we have been down this road before, just with different people. So all in all it's a good season, but just to many people coming and going. I'll bet the guys who make the opening music cut scene were like omg, make up your minds already!! Also i do beleive the chinese/american girl left this season as well, because they had to many women in the cast. There are usually 8 full characters, and at one time i think there were 7, if you look on the box here there are 9. So i believe that's why actors got cut. Season 10 was pretty good but still lacked the umph in the end. So i can't hate any season of 90210, since i was a teenager growing up in that time period and it was my favorite show.Now that i'm 36, it may not be as relavant, but a good watch none the less. I ripped mine all onto my computer, much easier to sort through the seasons that way. So enjoy this, it's not bad, but just lacking in some ways, strong in others. I just hate when original cast members go, and i feel Brandon should have been there till the end, and AT the end. Which he was neither. Him and Dylan could have rekindled things and made the show stunningly great.NOTE:They don't include Noah Hunter, and the new lawyer dude on the front of the box. So that makes 11.
