At that time in my life I had arrived at an unexpected juncture of massive upheaval. One of those agonizing checkpoints in the journey through middle-age that makes many of us want to walk off, shed society, and go live in the mountains. And this is exactly what Dick Proenneke accomplished.It says &#34;to be content with one's own thoughts and company&#34;. What a truly amazing concept? To be able to escape &#34;The Rat Race&#34;. Just sit listening to the subtle harmony's of nature while breathing in only cool fresh air. Nothing but wildlife for neighbors. All alone with your thoughts without the cacophony of modern life. I find myself relaxing as I write this.*Spoiler* - It was stunning to eventually find out that the journey he had begun in 1968 at the age of 52 would continue on, with only the occasional trip back to visit family, for the next 30 years. In 1999, at the age of 82, he did return to live out the remaining four years of his life with his brother.I highly recommend this DVD, its sequel, and the two accompanying books. Over the years I have lent them out to many friends and they all say the same thing. What this man could accomplish with only his hand tools was nothing short of amazing.

It's interesting to read all the reviews and see what other people's perspectives are and how his life has inspired them.  The things that stood out for me is Dicks self discipline, work ethic and values.  I highly recommend watching the video first and then reading the book (One Mans Wilderness).  The video was made off the 1972 best selling book but helps you visualize Dick's daily activities as you read.  The book fills in all the holes that you miss in the video; they definitely go together well.  Dick reminds us (me) about keeping priorities straight, specifically what a person needs versus what a person wants.  I have been guilty of allowing my ""wants"" in life dominate me at times and not keeping things in perspective.  Dick's life serves as a reminder to me that all people ""need"" shelter, nutrition and good physical and mental health; everything else is a want.  Hard work and accomplishing something with your own hands is one of the best rewards a person can give to themselves.This video is watched almost everyday in our house.  My wife and son watch it too and it never gets old.  There is a peace to it that you'll never get from TV.  I made the mistake (not really) of loaning it to a friend who has watched it with his boys more than 20 times in the past couple of weeks.  I can't imagine too many people that would not gain something from this and Dick's legacy.Don't pass up the opportunity this video offers.  I would love to see this expanded on and learn more about Dick and his life prior to his first full year in Alaska (1968).

910589,A3GIESLBKUBGZQ,B0009PU9AC,Richard R. Powell,"[6, 6]","The work -- carrying sand and gravel, cutting trees, poles, moss, etc. for his cabin -- is impressive enough, but the cutting of boards from logs for the window frames and doors with a hand saw, making hinges from Spruce roots, and even a wooden lock for the door, produces at first admiration and then a sort of awe. He also makes the furniture, fireplace (with stones he collects from far and wide), spoons and bowls. He makes a fridge in the permafrost and takes temperatures on a warm day to show the contrast.I thought about the planning involved in both the design of the cabin, and in the securing of supplies for his garden and to carry him through the winter. Then I factored in the solo filming of it all, which I know from experience, is time consuming and requires some thought and expertise.The shots of wildlife in the area around his cabin are impressive and I forgot most of the time that the shots of himself had been carefully staged. And it all comes off rather matter-of-factly as if it is no big deal, just a guy having a little bit of fun.Of course he hunted (including dressing and butchery) and smokes a variety of animals, tans sheep skin, and grows a respectable garden -- in Alaska.The last few minutes of the film indicates that he went on to live in the cabin for 35 years, but does not indicate how he developed and edited the film, what he did for money (I presume trapping?) or how he replenished his tools and gear. He was a mechanic prior to heading out there, but did he come back to civilization for money? Perhaps the book gives more details.I am not a builder, or particularly adept with my hands, but this film really reveals what it takes to survive in the wilderness -- skill with your hands AND brains. He must have practiced a fair bit before heading out; no one can just cut a long board by hand with a rip saw without some practice (and he obviously knew how to keep his tools sharp). So what we are getting is the culmination of a life's experience and learning. At 51 he had what it took to make both a life and a film to be proud of.We may not all be builders, but all of us, by the 50 year mark or so, have amassed a certain body of knowledge and skills to allow us to create our own masterwork.

910590,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0009PU9AC,Scott Schiefelbein,"[25, 26]","Dick Proenneke almost lost his eyesight after some diesel fuel splashed into his eyes while on the job.  That was in the early 1960's.  So, he decided that, while he still could, he would take his brains and brawn into the Alaskan wilderness to see if he could carve out a life for himself in some of the harshest conditions imaginable.  Fortunately for us, he brought along a little 8mm film camera to film some of his exploits, and he also kept a daily journal.  35 years later, at the age of 82, he decided that he had proven himself and left his little slice of paradise behind.  Those minus-forty degree temperatures in the height of winter get a little tough for the old bones.The result of Dick's little film clips and his journal is the documentary, ""Alone in the Wilderness.""  Much of the hour-long DVD is given over to clips of Dick building perhaps the perfect log cabin with his own two hands - even making his own tools.  Even a master carpenter would have to feel a little inadequate watching Dick cut his own lumber, carry logs over one shoulder, build a fireplace and chimney, and even use Alaska's natural permafrost to create his own refrigerator!  This is all after Dick makes several of his own tools - truly amazing.Other segments of the film are simple explorations of the wilderness by Dick and his camera.  Look for some amazing shots of fish, moose, bear, mountain goats, wolves, and most charmingly, a wolverine playing slip-and-slide down a snowy slope.  Proenneke's journals are read in voiceovers by the filmmakers, and he writes with a plain Iowa sensibility (""Winter comes on, quick as a broken shoelace.""This is back-to-basics filmmaking about a back-to-basics man.  Yet through this simple film perhaps the simplest questions are asked and answered - how much does a man need, how much can a man withstand, and how much of our modern-day baggage is really all that necessary.  The answers are, in order, not much, a lot, and very little.

I mean, what little boy doesn't dream of building his own cabin out in the woods? And what man still wonders if he could, given the opportunity.Well, now I have a friend, in his late 20s, who just bought a piece of property and is planning to build his own cabin to live in, much as Richard Proenneke did in Alaska in 1968. My friend is inspired and influenced by this film and the accompanying book, and he gladly loaned it to me to watch.I was as inspired by this film the second time around, and now I'd like to read the book to find out &#34;the rest of the story.&#34;There is much to appreciate here, but probably most inspiring to me is the way Proenneke gathers his materials, constructs his tools and builds his cabin. He is obviously a master carpenter putting together a lifetime of skills (while in his 50s) in the remote wilderness of Alaska. Even his self-filming techniques are interesting, especially in this day of people taking &#34;selfless&#34; all the time.I highly recommend this film to those who love the outdoors in general, Alaska in particular, or who can appreciate a man who pursues his dream to live a life of self-sufficiency.",5,Inspiring visual autobiography of self-sufficiency in remote Alaska,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,1239,"['saw', 'film', 'PBS', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'thought', 'many', 'times', 'mean', 'what', 'little', 'boy', ""n't"", 'dream', 'building', 'own', 'cabin', 'woods', 'what', 'man', 'still', 'could', 'given', 'opportunity.Well', 'now', 'have', 'friend', 'late', '20s', 'who', 'just', 'bought', 'piece', 'property', 'planning', 'build', 'own', 'cabin', 'live', 'much', 'Richard', 'Proenneke', 'did', 'Alaska', '1968', 'friend', 'inspired', 'influenced', 'film', 'accompanying', 'book', 'gladly', 'loaned', 'watch.I', 'was', 'inspired', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'now', ""'d"", 'like', 'read', 'book', 'find', 'out', '34', 'rest', 'story.', '34', 'much', 'appreciate', 'here', 'probably', 'most', 'inspiring', 'way', 'Proenneke', 'materials', 'tools', 'cabin', 'obviously', 'master', 'carpenter', 'putting', 'together', 'lifetime', 'skills', '50s', 'remote', 'wilderness', 'Alaska', 'Even', 'self-filming', 'techniques', 'are', 'interesting', 'especially', 'day', 'people', 'taking', '34', 'selfless', '34', 'time.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'love', 'outdoors', 'general', 'Alaska', 'particular', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'man', 'who', 'dream', 'live', 'life', 'self-sufficiency']",N/A
