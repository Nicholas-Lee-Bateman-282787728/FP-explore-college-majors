38521,A3W3PK9TVKEH7Q,0780631528,Allen Jackson,"[1, 1]","Loved this film when I first saw it in theaters, and I have the wonderful DVD, which contains several good extras--deleted scenes, actor bios, some other stuff.  The DVD's picture quality is fantastic--beautiful, very sharp, new-looking-- on older, tube TVs.  But only ""good-to-excellent"" on HD TVs.So, I bought the Blu Ray for my HD TV.  As the title of my review states, it has a beautiful, sharp, brand-new-looking picture on my HD TV, and great sound, too.  But, NO menu, NO extras, NOTHING besides the movie.  It is also 19 seconds shorter than the film on the DVD, but this Blu-Ray version's lost 19 seconds is ONLY the deleted, 19-second graphic screen before the beginning of the movie that tells viewers that this is purely fictitious, the characters are not real people, etc.  The actual filmed movie is 100% intact. The Blu Ray is made in Canada, and the artwork and description on the back of the case are about 90% American style, 10% not.The verdict: definitely buy the DVD for an older tube TV, but for HD, you may want both the DVD and the Blu Ray. The Blu Ray's picture looks brighter and sharper on my new 55"" HD TV, but I like the extras--available only on the DVD.In Amazon's product description for this Blu Ray, it says: ""Special Features: Interactive Menus/Chapter Search, Alternate Endings, Theatrical Trailer, Interactive Film Trivia, Filmography, Deleted Scenes, Original Screenplay."" ---- BUT I repeat, that is ALL wrong; there are NO extras on the Blu Ray, AND IT TELLS YOU SO WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE BR PLAYER AND A MESSAGE APPEARS ONSCREEN SAYING THAT THERE IS NO MENU!",3,"Great HD picture on Blu Ray; but NO extras, not even a menu!",1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,1598,"['Loved', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'theaters', 'have', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'several', 'good', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'actor', 'bios', 'other', 'stuff', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'fantastic', 'beautiful', 'very', 'sharp', 'new-looking', 'older', 'tube', 'TVs', 'only', 'good-to-excellent', 'HD', 'TVs.So', 'bought', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'HD', 'TV', 'title', 'review', 'states', 'beautiful', 'sharp', 'brand-new-looking', 'picture', 'HD', 'TV', 'great', 'sound', 'too', 'NO', 'menu', 'NO', 'extras', 'NOTHING', 'movie', 'also', '19', 'seconds', 'shorter', 'film', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'lost', '19', 'seconds', 'ONLY', 'deleted', '19-second', 'graphic', 'screen', 'beginning', 'movie', 'viewers', 'purely', 'fictitious', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'people', 'etc', 'actual', 'filmed', 'movie', '100', '%', 'intact', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'made', 'Canada', 'artwork', 'description', 'back', 'case', 'are', '90', '%', 'American', 'style', '10', '%', 'not.The', 'verdict', 'definitely', 'buy', 'DVD', 'older', 'tube', 'TV', 'HD', 'may', 'want', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'picture', 'brighter', 'sharper', 'new', '55', 'HD', 'TV', 'like', 'extras', 'available', 'only', 'DVD.In', 'Amazon', 'product', 'description', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Special', 'Features', 'Interactive', 'Menus/Chapter', 'Search', 'Alternate', 'Endings', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'Interactive', 'Film', 'Trivia', 'Filmography', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'repeat', 'ALL', 'wrong', 'are', 'NO', 'extras', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'AND', 'IT', 'TELLS', 'YOU', 'WHEN', 'YOU', 'PUT', 'IT', 'IN', 'THE', 'BR', 'PLAYER', 'A', 'MESSAGE', 'APPEARS', 'ONSCREEN', 'SAYING', 'THERE', 'NO', 'MENU']",N/A

38524,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780631528,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","My sister often rants and raves about the greatness of this movie when I'm around her.  Her obvious bias to the hotness that is Vin Diesel clearly distorts her opinion of this movie, but I must say that after actually giving it a try, there are moments in this movie that work extremely well, and when it's all said and done it's actually a pretty decent movie.The film revolves around college dropout Seth Davis who is constantly trying to get out from under his fathers disapproval.  Dropping out of college and running and illegal casino out of his apartment isn't the right way to go about earning his affections, but Seth doesn't seem to understand that.  When a chance meeting with stock broker Greg Weinstein gets Seth's appetite wet for the big bucks to be had with this legit line of work he decides that this may be just what he needs to get his father to forgive him, and be proud of him.  It appears that Seth has a knack for this business.  Before long he's become a selling machine and is on his way to making his first million.  But then he notices something that's just not right, and after doing a little digging he realizes that this legit gig may not be all that legit after all.Giovanni Ribisi is one of those actors I really wish would break out in a huge way.  I've always really liked him, and I feel that given the right role he could land in awards territory.  His performance here is strong; in fact it would be golden if it weren't muddled by some poorly scripted areas.  Scenes where he's `selling' are flawless; yet when he's interacting with his father it becomes a little sappy and overly clich&eacute;d.  His big `crying' scene comes off forced and it just takes away from the film in my opinion.  It's in stark contrast to the `relationship' scene at the diner, which is in my opinion one of the best scenes in the film; go figure.Vin Diesel soars here.  His performance as Chris Varick, the broker who takes Seth under his wing, is remarkably flawless.  Nia Long is beautiful and graceful yet sorely underused here.  I with they would have given her something more to do.  Ron Rifkin is believable as Seth's domineering father even if I never could begin to `like' his character.And I'll just say it now; I thought Ben Affleck was the worst thing about this movie.What makes `Boiler Room' so poignant is that is exposes the way that greed can ravage anyone.  It's not the type of film you expect to be deep or meaningful but when the credits start to roll you realize that this movie represents a growing problem in Corporate-America.  The careless and apathetic attitude of most all the characters is sadly not exaggerated.  As much as you want to just slap these characters upside the head for their selfish and horrendous actions you can't help but see a little bit of them inside yourself.  What we also get to see is that no one is as innocent as they appear to be.  Even if one is morally just it doesn't make them ethically just.  Look at the comparisons between Seth and his father.  Seth may not do everything up to the high moral code his father follows but he appears to have a genuine care for other people whereas his father, self-righteous and on his high horse uses that moral ruler as an iron fist that crushes his relationship (""what relationship?"") with his son.In the end I enjoyed `Boiler Room'.  It's not brilliant and it is predictable, but it works for the most part.  It could have been tweaked a bit, but what movie couldn't use a little tweaking?  Watch it to see Diesel out perform his co-stars and prove he's more than one big muscle and watch it to see the unwavering potential hidden behind Giovanni Ribisi's stutter.  It's not as powerful as `Wall Street' but it doesn't need to be.",4,"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the boiler room...",1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,3747,"['sister', 'often', 'rants', 'raves', 'greatness', 'movie', 'when', ""'m"", 'obvious', 'bias', 'hotness', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'clearly', 'opinion', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'actually', 'giving', 'try', 'are', 'moments', 'movie', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'movie.The', 'film', 'around', 'college', 'dropout', 'Seth', 'Davis', 'who', 'constantly', 'trying', 'get', 'out', 'fathers', 'disapproval', 'Dropping', 'college', 'running', 'illegal', 'casino', 'apartment', ""n't"", 'right', 'way', 'go', 'earning', 'affections', 'Seth', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'When', 'chance', 'meeting', 'stock', 'broker', 'Greg', 'Weinstein', 'Seth', 'appetite', 'wet', 'big', 'bucks', 'be', 'had', 'legit', 'line', 'work', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'what', 'get', 'father', 'forgive', 'be', 'proud', 'Seth', 'knack', 'business', 'long', 'become', 'selling', 'machine', 'way', 'making', 'first', 'million', 'then', 'something', 'just', 'not', 'right', 'doing', 'little', 'digging', 'legit', 'gig', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'legit', 'all.Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'one', 'actors', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'break', 'out', 'huge', 'way', ""'ve"", 'always', 'really', 'liked', 'feel', 'given', 'right', 'role', 'could', 'land', 'awards', 'territory', 'performance', 'here', 'strong', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'golden', 'were', ""n't"", 'muddled', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'areas', 'Scenes', 'where', 'selling', 'are', 'flawless', 'yet', 'when', 'interacting', 'father', 'little', 'sappy', 'overly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd.', 'big', 'crying', 'scene', 'off', 'forced', 'just', 'away', 'film', 'opinion', 'stark', 'contrast', 'relationship', 'scene', 'diner', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'go', 'figure.Vin', 'Diesel', 'soars', 'here', 'performance', 'Chris', 'Varick', 'broker', 'who', 'Seth', 'wing', 'remarkably', 'flawless', 'Nia', 'Long', 'beautiful', 'graceful', 'yet', 'sorely', 'underused', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'something', 'more', 'do', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'believable', 'Seth', 'domineering', 'father', 'even', 'never', 'could', 'begin', 'like', 'character.And', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'now', 'thought', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'was', 'worst', 'thing', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'so', 'poignant', 'way', 'greed', 'can', 'ravage', 'anyone', 'not', 'type', 'film', 'expect', 'be', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'when', 'credits', 'start', 'roll', 'realize', 'movie', 'growing', 'problem', 'Corporate-America', 'careless', 'apathetic', 'attitude', 'most', 'characters', 'sadly', 'not', 'exaggerated', 'As', 'much', 'want', 'just', 'slap', 'characters', 'upside', 'head', 'selfish', 'horrendous', 'actions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'see', 'little', 'bit', 'What', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'one', 'as', 'innocent', 'appear', 'be', 'Even', 'one', 'morally', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'ethically', 'just', 'Look', 'comparisons', 'Seth', 'father', 'Seth', 'may', 'not', 'do', 'everything', 'up', 'high', 'moral', 'code', 'father', 'have', 'genuine', 'care', 'other', 'people', 'father', 'self-righteous', 'high', 'horse', 'moral', 'ruler', 'iron', 'fist', 'relationship', 'what', 'relationship', 'son.In', 'end', 'enjoyed', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'not', 'brilliant', 'predictable', 'most', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tweaked', 'bit', 'what', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'use', 'little', 'tweaking', 'Watch', 'see', 'Diesel', 'out', 'perform', 'co-stars', 'prove', 'more', 'one', 'big', 'muscle', 'watch', 'see', 'unwavering', 'potential', 'hidden', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'stutter', 'not', 'as', 'powerful', 'Wall', 'Street', ""n't"", 'need', 'be']",N/A

And, what do you know, during &quot;Boiler Room,&quot; the young stockbrokers are in a living room watching WALL STREET!  They've seen it so many times  that they're making jokes and speeches about what's going on in the film.  A nice touch.  And there are many good scenes in this movie.  But the  problem is that they set the movie up for some exciting plot resolutions  and then failed every one of them.  In fact, we're waiting to see what the  kid's greed will do, and it turns out that he wasn't that greedy after all.  We're waiting to see what his mean father would do, and it turns out at  the end that his father &quot;regretted&quot; being mean and so isn't that  mean after all.  Come on now, this very nice premise for a movie has severe  script problems.  Blame the screenwriter.  The actors and director did  their best, but they couldn't make up a story for us.  It was the  screenwriter's job to make up a story.  The screenwriter in WALL STREET did  it, and the screenwriter here didn't.  Is it worth seeing?  Yes, if you  want some authentic stock-broker talk.  Even more authentic, in its way,  than GLENGARY GLEN ROSS, which I found lacking in trader smarts.

Seth Davis, the innocent newcomer, is introduced to the underground operation run by stockbrokers looking to cheat people out of their money, in hope of becoming filthy rich. Everyone in the firm is in their early 20's rapidly acquiring wealth, and none of them dare ask questions as to where their wealth comes from. Seth is the only individual curious to know how he is becoming so prosperous. A series of coincidences lead to his discovery, and eventually to his backlash against the firm. Between the time of Seth Davis' unskilled work, while in training as a stockbroker, to his mastery of the job, when he attempts to escape the fraudulence that he had once taken part in, a string of intricate details and relationships maintain a tense and entertaining atmosphere for Boiler Room.  The intense environment, and heated dialogue is what makes Boiler Room such a unique and compelling film. Conversations between characters are cunning and edgy. Characters evolve from good to bad and vice versa throughout. Seth's own father takes his twists in personality, from a spiteful, stubborn, disillusioned parent, to a more sensitive, and compassionate human being. Some of these moments are a bit sappy, but never overdone, and always sincere and believable. Nearly all of Seth's friends are pompous, self-centered hypocrites, which he soon finds out through his experiences with them. He discovers who his true friends are as well, and by the end of the movie, finds out who he really is.  The acting display is surprisingly good. Giovanni Ribisi as Seth does a remarkable job, clearly proving his worth, in a star-making role. Ron Rifkin does wonders with his character, as Seth's father, contributing to the reality of their relationship. And supporting actors such as Ben Afflek (Jim Young, head of the training department), Nicky Katt (Greg, ice-cold rival of Seth), and Vin Diesel (Chris, close colleague to Seth), all execute marvelous acting performances that help keep the movie together for its audience.  The movie is fast paced and punchy, much like a treadmill constantly gaining momentum. By the end of the movie, it has its greatest grip on the viewer. I found myself wishing it would not end so soon. Ultimately, moral values triumph over the harsh injustices of the real world, but the damages done, can never be reversed.Boiler Room, directed by Ben Younger, also starring Nia Long and Tom Everett Scott, is a brilliant and captivating thriller A-.",4,Secrets And Lies,972000000,"10 20, 2000",2000,2615,"['Boiler', 'Room', 'rated', 'R', '1', 'hour', '50', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'secret', 'world', 'existing', 'basis', 'corruption', 'treachery', 'deceit', 'Seth', 'Davis', 'innocent', 'newcomer', 'introduced', 'underground', 'operation', 'run', 'stockbrokers', 'looking', 'cheat', 'people', 'money', 'hope', 'becoming', 'filthy', 'rich', 'Everyone', 'firm', 'early', '20', 'rapidly', 'acquiring', 'wealth', 'none', 'dare', 'ask', 'questions', 'where', 'wealth', 'Seth', 'only', 'individual', 'curious', 'know', 'how', 'becoming', 'so', 'prosperous', 'series', 'coincidences', 'lead', 'discovery', 'eventually', 'backlash', 'firm', 'time', 'Seth', 'Davis', 'unskilled', 'work', 'training', 'stockbroker', 'mastery', 'job', 'when', 'escape', 'fraudulence', 'had', 'once', 'taken', 'part', 'string', 'intricate', 'details', 'relationships', 'maintain', 'tense', 'entertaining', 'atmosphere', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'intense', 'environment', 'heated', 'dialogue', 'what', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'unique', 'compelling', 'film', 'Conversations', 'characters', 'are', 'cunning', 'edgy', 'Characters', 'evolve', 'good', 'bad', 'vice', 'versa', 'Seth', 'own', 'father', 'twists', 'personality', 'spiteful', 'stubborn', 'disillusioned', 'parent', 'more', 'sensitive', 'compassionate', 'human', 'being', 'moments', 'are', 'bit', 'sappy', 'never', 'overdone', 'always', 'sincere', 'believable', 'Nearly', 'Seth', 'friends', 'are', 'pompous', 'self-centered', 'hypocrites', 'soon', 'out', 'experiences', 'who', 'true', 'friends', 'are', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'movie', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'acting', 'display', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Seth', 'remarkable', 'job', 'clearly', 'proving', 'worth', 'star-making', 'role', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'wonders', 'character', 'Seth', 'father', 'contributing', 'reality', 'relationship', 'supporting', 'actors', 'such', 'Ben', 'Afflek', 'Jim', 'Young', 'head', 'training', 'department', 'Nicky', 'Katt', 'Greg', 'ice-cold', 'rival', 'Seth', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Chris', 'close', 'colleague', 'Seth', 'execute', 'marvelous', 'acting', 'performances', 'help', 'keep', 'movie', 'together', 'audience', 'movie', 'fast', 'paced', 'punchy', 'much', 'treadmill', 'constantly', 'gaining', 'momentum', 'end', 'movie', 'greatest', 'grip', 'viewer', 'found', 'wishing', 'would', 'not', 'end', 'so', 'soon', 'Ultimately', 'moral', 'values', 'triumph', 'harsh', 'injustices', 'real', 'world', 'damages', 'done', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'reversed.Boiler', 'Room', 'directed', 'Ben', 'Younger', 'also', 'starring', 'Nia', 'Long', 'Tom', 'Everett', 'Scott', 'brilliant', 'captivating', 'thriller', 'A-']",N/A

38532,A3R4TS03ITT2JC,0780631528,Bob Thompson,"[1, 2]","It is very obvious to anyone who has seen &quot;Wall Street&quot; that this film borrows an awful lot from Oliver Stone's 1987 classic. Every stock broker in the film seems to be modelled on Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko character with the exception of Giavanni Ribisi who unfortunately seems to be moulded on the Charlie Sheen part. The paralels between the two films are incredible but that doesn't mean that &quot;The Boiler Room&quot; is in anyway a lesser film because of it.Giovanni Ribisi plays Seth, a 19 year old who drops out of college to start his own backdoor casino. He proves to be a genius running &quot;the biz&quot; and one night he is payed a visit by a long time friend who has now become a stock broker. With visions of becoming a millionaire within three years Seth eagerly takes a job at the firm.Throughout the film Ribisi seems to have a strange attachment to his Father. (Much like the Sheen's in Wall Street) He wants to be constantly &quot;doing good&quot; so his Father can be proud of him. This is fine and everything but eventually it gets way out of control and the film starts to indulge in banal sentimentality. You start to wonder towards the end if Ribisi is suffering from some strange reverse Oedipus complex or something.The best scenes are indeed the ones at the office. Ribisi quickly learns how to &quot;close&quot; and get anyone's money but gradually starts to feel hollow inside. In one scene he takes the life savings of an easily manipulated middle class Father. He consciously takes his money knowing it will be lost.The stock brokers are a fitting image of Gordon Gekko. Ben Affleck especially who's only part in the movie is to come in the room and scream at the new guys. &quot;Whoever says money is the root of all evil doesn't have any&quot; is his character's memorable line. You get the impression though that his character is only there to amplify the cuthroat mentality of the wall street lifestyle. He's still real fun to listen to though. The rest of the brokers are all high on their own greed and are so over the top that it's actually just silly. For no reason there are three bar fights as rival broker's start trouble over who wears a nicer tie. I'm not sure who wrote their dialogue but apparently they have been watching too many mob movies. Each broker talks like a Maffioso and really in the end can't be taken seriously. &quot;American Psycho&quot; satirized stock broker's so well when they were seen arguing about who had the nicest font on their business card. &quot;The Boiler Room's&quot; broker's are basically a more extreme version of the same thing.&quot;The Boiler Rrom&quot; really flows well and that is it's best asset. It is the perfect length and never goes too far in one direction to get boring. The killer instinct is played out perfectly and makes for an energetic, often times very funny movie.

But now after the recent financial meltdown it is absolutely fascinating.  It is still the same film but to examine in the context of the time in which it was made copared to now is quite revealing.First of all, this film was made in year 2000 which means the stock fraud scams in the film are nothing compared to what is going on right now.  To provide a further perspective on how innocent the times were when the film came out it before the collapse of the .com bubble.The film presents these boiler rooms in comparison with the much bigger firms.  The brokerage is called JT Marlin a rip off of the name JP Morgan, or as it called now JP Morgan Chase.  The creators of the film show these crooked stock brokers as an example to an extent of what the big firms are like.  That is all good and fine for the year 2000 which is when the film was made when everything was much more innocent and clean then they are now.  In the present day, however, we know that the huge financial firms to an extent as corrupt as the boiler rooms they are even more corrupt.  An obvious example of this is firms such Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase  sold investment community Credit Default deals knowing full well waht they were selling was absolute and complete garbage.  The only difference between the boiler room brokers and the big banks are that the boiler rooms are small time crooks while the big firms are HUGE crooks.It is interesting that characters like Seth's father consider Goldman Sachs to be an almost moral angel compared to JT Morlin.  The brokers at JT Marlin could not possibly pull off the absolutely enormous level of fraud that the so called ""legitimate"" firms have done.A final interesting thing about this film is that before Seth joined JT Marlin he ran a casino.  The stock has been called many times just a giant casino.  The difference is if you gamble your money in a casino you know it is not a sure thing you will make any money compared Wall Street which bases their investments, or ""bets"" based on supposedly sound economic principles to falsely reassure themselves that what are really doing is putting their money on the craps table",5,A film that is even more interesting after recent events,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,2290,"['When', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'thought', 'presented', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'ethics', 'nature', 'Capitalism', 'now', 'recent', 'financial', 'meltdown', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'still', 'same', 'film', 'examine', 'context', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'copared', 'now', 'quite', 'revealing.First', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'year', '2000', 'stock', 'fraud', 'scams', 'film', 'are', 'nothing', 'compared', 'what', 'going', 'right', 'now', 'provide', 'further', 'perspective', 'how', 'innocent', 'times', 'were', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'collapse', '.com', 'bubble.The', 'film', 'presents', 'boiler', 'rooms', 'comparison', 'much', 'bigger', 'firms', 'brokerage', 'called', 'JT', 'Marlin', 'rip', 'name', 'JP', 'Morgan', 'called', 'now', 'JP', 'Morgan', 'Chase', 'creators', 'film', 'show', 'crooked', 'stock', 'brokers', 'example', 'extent', 'what', 'big', 'firms', 'are', 'good', 'fine', 'year', '2000', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'everything', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'innocent', 'clean', 'then', 'are', 'now', 'present', 'day', 'however', 'know', 'huge', 'financial', 'firms', 'extent', 'as', 'corrupt', 'boiler', 'rooms', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'corrupt', 'obvious', 'example', 'firms', 'such', 'Goldman', 'Sachs', 'JP', 'Morgan', 'Chase', 'sold', 'investment', 'community', 'Credit', 'Default', 'deals', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'were', 'selling', 'was', 'absolute', 'complete', 'garbage', 'only', 'difference', 'boiler', 'room', 'brokers', 'big', 'banks', 'are', 'boiler', 'rooms', 'are', 'small', 'time', 'crooks', 'big', 'firms', 'are', 'HUGE', 'crooks.It', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Seth', 'father', 'consider', 'Goldman', 'Sachs', 'be', 'almost', 'moral', 'angel', 'compared', 'JT', 'Morlin', 'brokers', 'JT', 'Marlin', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'pull', 'off', 'absolutely', 'enormous', 'level', 'fraud', 'so', 'called', 'legitimate', 'firms', 'have', 'done.A', 'final', 'interesting', 'thing', 'film', 'Seth', 'joined', 'JT', 'Marlin', 'ran', 'casino', 'stock', 'been', 'called', 'many', 'times', 'just', 'giant', 'casino', 'difference', 'gamble', 'money', 'casino', 'know', 'not', 'sure', 'thing', 'will', 'make', 'money', 'compared', 'Wall', 'Street', 'investments', 'bets', 'based', 'supposedly', 'sound', 'economic', 'principles', 'falsely', 'reassure', 'what', 'are', 'really', 'doing', 'putting', 'money', 'craps', 'table']",N/A
38534,AK2AQIULQDFS5,0780631528,Bradley Tobin,"[0, 3]","The Big Question that surrounds ""Boiler Room"" is... ""Is this a Story that Needed to be Told"". And the answer is.. No, It's not a True story, It's not a very Exciting story, but it Does manage to hold interest because of a Strong lead performance by Giovanni Ribisi and a Spectacular Supporting cast.The story involves Seth Davis, (Ribisi) a guy in his Early Twenties who runs an illegal casino out of his apartment. When a friend knocks on the door with a job offer, Seth takes it, as he wishes to show his dad that he can do Legitimate work. Within Three months he is one of the Top Stock-Brokers at the firm, but he also starts to believe that the firm is Corrupt.The Jumpy Editing got on my nerves here and there, but it was only real used in the first half of the film, and once it stopped, the film Improved. The directing is nothing Fancy, not Bad, but not Spectacular. Writer/director Ben Younger lets his Terrific cast tell the story. ""Boiler Room"" suffers from Seen-it-all-before Syndrome. If you know that going in, you can just sit back and enjoy the Top-notch performances.Ribisi is as Spectacular as ever, he carries the film. Every facial expression, every line of dialogue, he makes look totally authentic. Vin Diesel, Scott Caan, Tom Everett Scott and Jamie Kennedy give Wonderful Supporting performances as his Co-workers. Diesel gets more screen time then the others and he registers best.Ron Rifkin gives the performance of his Career as Seth's Father. The scenes where he and Seth talk, argue, and ultimately mature are among the films Best scenes. (certainly the best Dialogue scenes) But, in the end it is Ben Affleck who walks off with the film, his Extended Cameo proves why he is so Popular.

The film seriously lacks  character development.  The beginning gets you interested but the film  doesn't give you a reason to care about any of the characters or what  happens to them.  Soon, the film becomes more and more unbelievable and  thus somewhat boring.  Dialog such as &quot;Don't push the wood&quot;,  &quot;Don't pitch the bitch&quot; and &quot;we've got guys here who make a  million dollars in commissions but can't qualify for a loan to buy a Honda  Civic&quot; made me laugh.  The group scenes made the would be brokers look  like a bunch of incompetent used used car salesman.  The film makers tried  to flesh out the movie by putting a face on one of the victims, but it  wasn't enough.  When I read the review on the video box, I kept expecting  the father of the lead character to somehow be involved with the son in a  stock fraud scam.  It never really happens.  The FBI investigation like the  scenes with the one victim is much too weak and the film ends in a  predicable fizzle.

Jim Young (Ben Affleck) even quotes directly from the Alec Baldwin sales meeting: ""ABC = Always Be Closing."" There is even a scene where the young stockbrokers get together and watch Wall Street, quoting the dialogue verbatim, like some kind of twisted Rocky Horror Picture Show cult. But where the average person sees both movies as a cautionary tale about greed and the foolishness of trusting a salesperson to tell the truth, the boys of the Boiler Room take it as gospel. They are all Gordon Gecko wannabes, and they will Always Be Closing.---------------Jim Young: You Want details? Fine. I drive a Ferrari, 355 Cabriolet, What's up? I have a ridiculous house in the South Fork. I have every toy you could possibly imagine. And best of all kids, I am liquid.========================Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi) is smart but he drops out of college. He runs a successful off campus casino, but his father (Ron Rifkin), a federal judge, is none too pleased. Seth figures that the odds of him getting pinched are pretty high, so he takes a client's suggestion and applies at a stockbroker's for a position as an intern. He learns quick, and is soon a rising star of the firm, J.T. Marlon.------------------Man on phone: Take me off your list.Seth Davis: Fine, fine. I'm gonna take you off my list of successful people today.===========================Seeing a lot more potential in him than the rest of the yahoos, Chris (Vin Deisel) and Greg (Nicky Katt) show him the ropes. At least until Greg begins to get jealous of Seth's flirtations with the firm's secretary, Abby (Nia Long).Soon Seth passes his Series 7, and he's on his way. The philosophy of his company is ruthless and macho. Feelings are frowned upon, and the only thing that matters is closing the sale.---------------Jim Young: And there is no such thing as a no sale call. A sale is made on every call you make. Either you sell the client some stock or he sells you a reason he can't. Either way a sale is made, the only question is who is gonna close? You or him? Now be relentless, that's it, I'm done.=========================Giovanni Ribisi gives an excellent performance, as he perfects his sales techniques, he is also figuring out just exactly what is going on, how they are making the money. Usually Giovanni is more of a supporting actor, a character actor, but here he is the lead, and he really carries it well. He is driven to make money, but deeper than that, he wants to win his father's approval, and sees money as the means to that end. Abby is also driven to make money, but she is supporting her sick mother, and sees no other way than turning a blind eye to the suspect and shady practices of J.T. Marlon. The interaction between the two is very well played.-----------------Seth Davis: What do you mean, you're gonna pass. Alan, the only people making money passing are NFL quarterbacks and I don't see a number on your back.=========================Time for more lessons from motivational speaker, Jim Young:-------------------Jim Young: There's an important phrase that we use here, and think it's time that you all learned it. Act as if. You understand what that means?=============================Seth understands only too well the lessons of Jim Young. Throughout Boiler Room very good use is made of a rap soundtrack that really underscores Seth's attitude well. As he learns just how crooked the firm he works for is, and sees the destruction that they leave in their wake, he yearns for his old casino, where he at least provided a service that his customers wanted. He compares his current job to a crack dealer, and wonders, which is worse?-------------Seth Davis: The Notorious BIG said it best: ""Either you're slingin' crack-rock, or you've got a wicked jump-shot."" Nobody wants to work for it anymore. There's no honor in taking that after school job at Mickey Dee's, honor's in the dollar, kid. So I went the white boy way of slinging crack-rock: I became a stock broker.========================Boiler Room takes what could be very boring--selling stocks over the phone--and makes a very exciting movie out of it. It feeds you enough information so you understand what is at stake, but it doesn't bog down with too much exposition. It paints a vivid picture of a world that is both fascinating and repellent. Amid all the moral ambiguity and decadence there are genuine human feelings, and you feel connected with what the characters are going through, especially with Giovanni Ribisi as Seth and Nia Long as Abby. It is a perfect blend of testosterone, finance, and emotions.-------------------------Seth Davis: I had a very strong work ethic.

38541,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,0780631528,Charismatic Creature,"[3, 13]","Uninspired 2nd go around of the basic plot of &quot;Wall Street&quot;, which was one of Oliver Stone's least successful efforts. Besides a weak,unoriginal script, &quot;Boiler Room&quot; is marred by miscasting and a really out-of-place musical score. Hip-hop and rap music is just fine when it's part of the story as in &quot;Eight Mile&quot; but it's forced and inappropriate here. There is nothing to connect this type of urban music with the very suburban and city types of stockbrokers and telemarketers depicted. It's very jarring.Giovanni Ribisi (Seth), an idiosyncratic charcter actor anyways, looks as pale as a vampire. His oddness does nothing to define his character, a young man who is drifting into criminal gambling as a business even before drifting into selling fake stocks. A lot of sentimental business transpires between him and his harsh father, a federal judge (Ron Rifkin) and this is about as entertaining as watching your family fight over dinner. It does absolutely nothing to propel the plot or even to explain why Seth -- from a priviledged upbringing -- has turned to the type of illegal business dealings you might associate more with someone from a poor background.There is an opportunity to see Vin Diesel, pre-stardom, and actually wearing a suit. He's low key here, which is a pleasure. Instant stardom has done nothing to mature this actor's style, but he was initially an appealing and different presence. Bennifer...ooops, Ben Affleck has a small role as a huckster, the &quot;Gordon Gecko&quot; of the film, inspiring the troops in the small chop shop, and he does a good job of capturing the salesman's smooth patter and dead eyes. When he says he is &quot;smiling ear to ear&quot; (as a result of his huge success), in fact his expression is blank and souless -- perfect. But he is in only a couple of brief scenes.The director pays homage to &quot;Wall Street&quot; by having the characters gather together at one of their big expensive (empty) houses and watch it on TV, while Diesel and Affleck effortless spout whole pages of dialogue from the film. I seriously doubt young brokers today are so hung up on a film from 1987! A time when they were probably in grade school! This is the DIRECTOR'S pet movie, not the characters and it's a clear sign that things are not going to progress in an original or entertaining way.&quot;Wall Street&quot; was not a good enough movie for a director to be aping (or the characters). It was a pretty lame, trite flick and was only watchable for Michael Douglas (Gecko) who singlehandedly revived his career from his Oscar winning role and became a major Hollywood player. Because of this, I consider &quot;Wall Street&quot; one of those rare films that sucks but is watching for a single great performance.Not so &quot;Boiler Room&quot;. There is nothing here but shallow, boring homage to a mediocre film. You learn nothing about the one-dimensional characters, nothing about the stock business, nothing about the laws against this sort of thing...you are just marking time. You have better things to do.

38542,ABN9MWPSML86,0780631528,Charles John Gervasi,"[0, 0]","This movie is a dark and human story about criminals.  At times it hits you over the head with how bad they are, but it also shows you how they got sucked into crime.  It plays on subtle levels by juxtaposing how bad these people are with their human need to justify what they are doing.  All the characters lie to each other and to themselves.  Rarely does the movie spell this out for the viewer.  There is no voice-of-reason or voice-of-morality character to the movie.  It's left to the viewer to put the characters' behavior in a moral context.The best part of the movie was the scene where Greg was driving Seth back to the office after their colleagues severely beat a man in bar brawl.  Greg criticizes their colleagues for blowing all their money, being violent, and having ""no stability"".  Just as he is saying this he yells at another driver who is slowing down, and he recklessly maneuvers his Porshe around the slower car.Later in the movie Seth, the main character, realizes what he's doing is wrong and tantamount to stealing.  He decides to do the right thing and get out of the criminal firm he works for.  First, however, he wants to find a way to make off with some of the firm's money before leaving.  No one in the movie points out how silly it is that Seth thinks he needs to steal some money now that his morals prevent him from stealing.This is very believable behavior for people who have gotten away with crimes so long that they think that they can get away with anything and that it's not really wrong.  Despite what some people have written, the juvenile and criminal behavior portrayed in this movie is not unheard of in the business world.",5,A dark story about human frailty,1053216000,"05 18, 2003",2003,1670,"['movie', 'dark', 'human', 'story', 'criminals', 'times', 'head', 'how', 'bad', 'are', 'also', 'how', 'got', 'sucked', 'crime', 'subtle', 'levels', 'juxtaposing', 'how', 'bad', 'people', 'are', 'human', 'need', 'justify', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'characters', 'lie', 'other', 'Rarely', 'movie', 'spell', 'out', 'viewer', 'voice-of-reason', 'voice-of-morality', 'character', 'movie', 'left', 'viewer', 'put', 'characters', 'behavior', 'moral', 'context.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Greg', 'was', 'driving', 'Seth', 'back', 'office', 'colleagues', 'severely', 'beat', 'man', 'bar', 'brawl', 'Greg', 'colleagues', 'blowing', 'money', 'being', 'violent', 'having', 'stability', 'Just', 'saying', 'driver', 'who', 'slowing', 'down', 'recklessly', 'Porshe', 'slower', 'car.Later', 'movie', 'Seth', 'main', 'character', 'what', 'doing', 'wrong', 'tantamount', 'stealing', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'get', 'criminal', 'firm', 'First', 'however', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'off', 'firm', 'money', 'leaving', 'one', 'movie', 'out', 'how', 'silly', 'Seth', 'steal', 'money', 'now', 'morals', 'prevent', 'stealing.This', 'very', 'believable', 'behavior', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'crimes', 'so', 'long', 'think', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'anything', 'not', 'really', 'wrong', 'what', 'people', 'have', 'written', 'juvenile', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'not', 'unheard', 'business', 'world']",N/A

I'm not a big fan of Giovanni Ribisi, because of his emotionless  roles like in The Mod Squad, and others. Ribisi surely has proved me wrong  in this movie. He  &quot;kicks it up a notch&quot; as Seth. A self  entrepreneur, card room owner turned stock broker. It also stars Nia Long,  Vin Diesel and Ben &quot;where's my buddy Matt Damon in this movie&quot;  Affleck. Just think young, energetic, vulger, &quot;top of the world&quot;,  f--k everyone attitude and you got Boiler Room. A lot of the focus was  between Seth and his father. Throughout his life, Seth has been trying to  prove himself to his father (an emotional aspect of the movie that most of  us can relate to). His father is a well known and respected judge. Seth  gets a job as a stock broker, where he gains a little respect from his  father. All of a sudden, Seth is getting a taste of success as a broker,  gains a beautiful girlfriend (played by Nia Long) and has been accepted by  his father. Then everything starts crashing in! A cool part of the movie  was when the group of brokers were watching the movie Wall Street, and one  of the guys was narrating the movie word for word. I thought it was a great  movie overall, but it left a lot of loose ends. Like what's going to happen  to Seth, his father, and especially his relationship with his girlfriend?  It left you hanging! It also makes you want to go with an on-line broker  then a real one!

38544,A3E8BTA2SXPV3P,0780631528,cinemagirl,"[9, 10]","This film seems to cover all of the bases-fast-paced action, peerless performances, and hysterical dialogue (but a warning, they are all saturated with the vernacular of stressed-out, potty-mouthed stock  brokers). Although some reviews have said the script is convoluted and  lacks direction, I entirely disagree. The script contains scenes that  reveal the many dilemmas that plague Seth (Giovanni Ribisi) - his struggle  to gain the approval of his inhibited father, a federal judge; his fight to  live with himself; and his need for redemption. It is obvious that it is  quite difficult to find films that are so tightly and expertly woven these  days, but overlooked films like `The Boiler Room' confirm that there are  still writers and directors out there who know how to do their job  competently.Ben Affleck has a memorable cameo as the guy who motivates  the young brokers-to-be. Vin Diesel's role is small but he most definitely  makes the most of all of his scenes. Nia Long plays Abby, whose role (if I  must nitpick) I felt could have been developed a bit more and contained  more connecting scenes with  Seth. The kudos really goes to Giovanni  Ribisi, who is proving that he is fast becoming one of Hollywood's hottest  and most talented stars. Enigmatic in appearance and disquieting in  demeanor, he takes command of every scene and delivers his lines with  emotion and bite. I cannot think of another actor who could play the role  of Seth as well as he did. His performance in the role of a young man  struggling to come to terms with himself keeps you nailed to your seat for  the entire duration of the film.The rap music and slightly annoying  cinematography chiefly in the beginning of the film can be easily forgotten  once all the primary elements are established.

While teaching econ I gained a new appreciation for the films Wall Street and Glengary Glen Ross, two films I had seen before and thought were OK the  first time around.  After multiple viewings of Glen Gary and Wall Street I  now think they are both classic films, with unbelievable acting  performances.  And I enjoy using these films in the context of the  class.With that in mind, I was glad to finally see Boiler Room.  Boiler  Room is a OK movie.  Its not great, but its not a bad rental.  However, it  fails to match up to films it not only borrows from but actually mention  and show in the movie.  Its certainly one thing to be influenced by other  films, but its so obvious in Boiler Room that they wrote in scenes where  the characters are either watching or quoting these films.But my main  problem with the film is this:  The beginning of the film is great.  The  acting and writing are very good and we are introduced to some very  interesting characters.  I really enjoyed these characters and I wanted to  see more.  However, the films climax where it all goes does not live up to  the expectations of these characters.  We meet all these cool people and  the film really does not take them the distance and give us a good ending.  Wall Street and Glen Gary gave us good characters and placed them in a good  story.  Boiler Room gives us good characters but does not go with it.So,  in short great acting but not enough story.

Boiler, Room, staring Vin Diesel, Ben Affleck, Giovanni Ribisi & Nia Long, is a tale of the deceptions found in the stockbroker game, specifically with really slimy, shady operations that trade in illiquid penny stocks and leave their clients holding the bag 99% of the time.  Their sole goal is to make money at the EXPENSE of clients.  This stuff actually does occur in today's age so there is a bit of reality within the drama.I bought the DVD, having rented it already, for the following reasons.1) The soundtrack is great.2) Great Actors - fan of Ribisi and Diesel3) The movie accurately depicts the shenanigans and salesmanship that some firms do.  All of Wall Street is about sales.  It is about ringing the register because that is what generates nice, fat bonuses but this movie clearly talks about how these people understand people and their emotions.4) I used to work in the investment industry and I love seeing the slick willies go to work.  This is plain fraud in the movie but some brokers, at reputable firms, can really lay it on!The core plot of the movie is about Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi), a 19-year-old college dropout who strives for approval from his father, a judge who is horrified that his son operates a 24-hour illicit casino. When an old friend visits the casino with a fellow broker, Davis is impressed by their wads of money and yellow Ferrari, and decides to join the firm. In no time he's making sales and settling into the groove of the office and all the after-hours perks, but the dream fades when Davis discovers the scam that is making all of the brokers wealthy beyond their dreams.  This is not the antisocietal havoc of Fight Club, but the more deliberate mayhem that comes from greed run amok. The testosterone-junkie brokers of J.T. Marlin (the only female in the office is Abby, the receptionist and love interest, played by Nia Long) are out to make the sale, and whether that sale is legal or ethical doesn't matter...",4,Rating depends on what you want to get out of it,1017014400,"03 25, 2002",2002,2095,"['Hollywood', 'Wall', 'Street', 'firms', 'give', 'movie', 'producers', 'real', 'life', 'drama', 'greed', 'deception', 'sex', 'excesses', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'staring', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Nia', 'Long', 'tale', 'deceptions', 'found', 'stockbroker', 'game', 'specifically', 'really', 'slimy', 'shady', 'operations', 'trade', 'illiquid', 'penny', 'stocks', 'leave', 'clients', 'holding', 'bag', '99', '%', 'time', 'sole', 'goal', 'make', 'money', 'EXPENSE', 'clients', 'stuff', 'actually', 'occur', 'today', 'age', 'so', 'bit', 'reality', 'drama.I', 'bought', 'DVD', 'having', 'rented', 'already', 'following', 'reasons.1', 'soundtrack', 'great.2', 'Great', 'Actors', 'fan', 'Ribisi', 'Diesel3', 'movie', 'accurately', 'shenanigans', 'salesmanship', 'firms', 'do', 'Wall', 'Street', 'sales', 'ringing', 'register', 'what', 'nice', 'fat', 'bonuses', 'movie', 'clearly', 'talks', 'how', 'people', 'understand', 'people', 'emotions.4', 'used', 'work', 'investment', 'industry', 'love', 'seeing', 'slick', 'willies', 'go', 'work', 'plain', 'fraud', 'movie', 'brokers', 'reputable', 'firms', 'can', 'really', 'lay', 'core', 'plot', 'movie', 'Seth', 'Davis', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', '19-year-old', 'college', 'dropout', 'who', 'approval', 'father', 'judge', 'who', 'horrified', 'son', '24-hour', 'illicit', 'casino', 'When', 'old', 'friend', 'casino', 'fellow', 'broker', 'Davis', 'impressed', 'wads', 'money', 'yellow', 'Ferrari', 'join', 'firm', 'time', 'making', 'sales', 'settling', 'groove', 'office', 'after-hours', 'perks', 'dream', 'when', 'Davis', 'scam', 'making', 'brokers', 'wealthy', 'dreams', 'not', 'antisocietal', 'havoc', 'Fight', 'Club', 'more', 'deliberate', 'mayhem', 'greed', 'run', 'amok', 'testosterone-junkie', 'brokers', 'J.T', 'Marlin', 'only', 'female', 'office', 'Abby', 'receptionist', 'love', 'interest', 'played', 'Nia', 'Long', 'are', 'make', 'sale', 'sale', 'legal', 'ethical', ""n't"", 'matter']",N/A

Giovanni Ribisi plays, Seth, an unloved son who struggles to get traction in life. He's running an illegal casino out of his apartment, making plenty of money, but running afoul of his father who happens to be a federal judge. Dad is so unlikeable that if Seth had punched him, I would have CHEERED. Nonetheless, the lack of love is what pushes Seth into the biggest gambling hall in the world, namely the stock market. A former friend shows up for a little blackjack and pitches Seth on the opportunity to become a stock broker in a little known firm far from New York City. Seth takes the plunge, buying into the camaraderie, dreams of wealth, and lifestyle of the heavy hitters that include some great performances by the likes of Vin Diesel among others. It takes a while, but Seth figures out this place is a &#34;boiler room.&#34; Too late, the FBI is on the hunt and Seth has to figure out who is friend and foe as well as how to recover some lost funds for a client who trusted him with his life savings.

Writer/director Ben Younger is adept at portraying the testerone-drenched, competitive milieu that the characters inhabit.  For them, both work and play are ultimately about proving who has the largest male equipment, and whether anyone else gets hurt in their quest for self-aggrandizement is entirely beside the point.  Giovanni Ribisi is a weak but essentially decent person who gets caught up in this high-stakes world until he is finally forced to look at the morality of his behavior.  His scenes with Ron Rifkin, who plays his father, are very well done.Some have criticized this film by writing that it merely goes over the same ground as &quot;Wall Street&quot; and &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross.&quot;  My response: so what?  Materialism and greed are hugely relevant topics in contemporary American society and the film that is such a masterpiece that it says everything there is to say on the topic will never be made.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[0, 0]","In the wake of the collapse of the housing market, the credit crunch, several hundred million dollars being funneled to Wall Street in the form of government bailouts and the latest mega Wall Street scam by Bernard Madoff, this is a sobering movie that deals with the arrogance of crooks who masquerade as stock brokers.Giovanni Ribisi is most well known as a supporting actor in movies such asSaving Private Ryan (Special Limited Edition)as well as TV shows like The X Files.  In this film, he takes the leading role, which is somewhat remarkable in a movie that features the likes of Vin Diesel and Ben Affleck.  Ribisi rises to the occasion, however, and is sympathetic as a brand new stockbroker who is trying to learn the ropes at a firm.Problem is, this is the very type of firm that has helped lead the U.S. to its current economic recession.  The brokers are crooks who would worship paragons of duplicity such as Mr. Madoff.  In fact, for fun they sit around and recite the lines fromWall Street (20th Anniversary Edition)and think of Michael Douglas' character as someone they should look up to.  Talk about missing the point of a movie!There is a catharsis in this film in that the egocentric, arrogant thieves who think so highly of themselves  eventually find out their free-ride is over with.

38558,A2OMJJ05E87NBB,0780631528,E. J. Ludwig,"[1, 1]","I really agree with the positive reviews. How can one make moral vacuity interesting? This film succeeds. The lead character is not a tough guy with a conscience like Marlon Brando in 'On The Waterfront.' Rather, he pursues his amoral path with an almost innocent gusto.Gambling. Stealing. Lying. Fornicating. Cursing. Arrogance. These are all treated as the most normal qualities in the world. The main character and his girlfriend even wonder why he sometimes has twinges of conscience. After all, aren't the guys in the film just grabbing for the brass ring, the American dream. Life's supposed to be fun, isn't it?  There always have to be winners and losers, don't there?  So why not be a winner? It's about money, initiative, smarts, knowing how to close a deal. It is the utter normalcy of lifestyles devoid of virtue that, to me, make this a classic of American film making. To me, it's the essence of American materialistic existence...i.e., ""go for the gold."" The guys in the firm are on a path to jail and, ultimately, to hell, but they don't have a clue.Even the main character is fixed on the memory that his father unaccountably slapped his face when he was ten and fell off his bike and broke his leg. His deep, endless self pity gives him the sense that he is at bottom a good human being. What do I mean? His feelings were deeply hurt when his father slapped him, so he feels he deserves sympathy from others. He sees himself as a sympathetic figure, not someone who deserves to be judged by the F.B.I., God, or anyone else.Finally, the protagonist is granted full immunity by the F.B.I. for agreeing to answer all their questions about the misdeeds of his shady brokerage firm.

Case ""Proust  Gal""","[1, 2]","Young single men in their early twenties plus a lot of money equals, in  the first two-thirds of the movie, one of the highest testosterone  quotients in the history of the cinema. This is &quot;Maxim&quot; come to  life. This is why most of us don't want to work anywhere near the sales  staff ... anywhere. Even Nia Long has balls in this movie. I think this  must come close to &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; for most on-screen  uses of the F word, and once you factor in all the other dirty words it  makes the profanity of its subject matter joyously palpable. There are some  truly great scenes here - the &quot;Rocky Horror&quot;-izing of &quot;Wall  Street has been noted in these reviews, and it's great. But my favorite  that no one's noted (I had to hit the pause button to laugh for a minute or  two) was Ribisi's response to getting telemarketed by the Daily News. I'm  going to keep that in mind for the next telemarketing call I get. I never  thought of that approach to this all too common modern annoyance which, I  freely admit, I have been on the giving end of. Younger has a great eye for  framing his scenes and I like the look he gave the film, a real feel for  his Long Island and NYC locations. I do admit there are some problems with  the plot ... I get the feeling the movie was trimmed a bit to keep it under  two hours for that one extra daily screening, and as a result some of the  plot elements come across a bit haphazardly, such as the FBI investigation  and Ribisi's relationship with Long.At the same time there's no need for  the subplot with the guy who loses his life's savings ... why show all  those bits? They get a little pedantic. The scenes with his dad work better  because of Ron Rifkin's no-nonsense portrayal, but the last one seems  forced, and I'm still waiting for a real end to the whole movie. But  overall I recommend it with the caveats that there's a lot of grimly  authentic male behavior in this movie, including crudeness, violence and  lots of swearing.",4,"Never a dull moment, but the ending needed work",965260800,"08 3, 2000",2000,2018,"['Young', 'single', 'men', 'early', 'twenties', 'lot', 'money', 'equals', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'one', 'highest', 'testosterone', 'quotients', 'history', 'cinema', 'quot', 'Maxim', 'quot', 'come', 'life', 'why', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'work', 'anywhere', 'sales', 'staff', 'anywhere', 'Even', 'Nia', 'Long', 'balls', 'movie', 'think', 'must', 'come', 'close', 'quot', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'quot', 'most', 'on-screen', 'uses', 'F', 'word', 'once', 'factor', 'other', 'dirty', 'words', 'profanity', 'subject', 'matter', 'joyously', 'palpable', 'are', 'truly', 'great', 'scenes', 'here', 'quot', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'quot', '-izing', 'quot', 'Wall', 'Street', 'been', 'noted', 'reviews', 'great', 'favorite', 'one', 'noted', 'had', 'hit', 'pause', 'button', 'laugh', 'minute', 'two', 'was', 'Ribisi', 'response', 'getting', 'telemarketed', 'Daily', 'News', ""'m"", 'going', 'keep', 'mind', 'next', 'telemarketing', 'call', 'get', 'never', 'thought', 'approach', 'too', 'common', 'modern', 'annoyance', 'freely', 'admit', 'have', 'been', 'giving', 'end', 'Younger', 'great', 'eye', 'framing', 'scenes', 'like', 'look', 'gave', 'film', 'real', 'feel', 'Long', 'Island', 'NYC', 'locations', 'do', 'admit', 'are', 'problems', 'plot', 'get', 'feeling', 'movie', 'was', 'trimmed', 'bit', 'keep', 'two', 'hours', 'one', 'extra', 'daily', 'screening', 'result', 'plot', 'come', 'bit', 'haphazardly', 'such', 'FBI', 'investigation', 'Ribisi', 'relationship', 'Long.At', 'same', 'time', 'need', 'subplot', 'guy', 'who', 'life', 'savings', 'why', 'show', 'bits', 'get', 'little', 'pedantic', 'scenes', 'dad', 'work', 'better', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'no-nonsense', 'portrayal', 'last', 'one', 'forced', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'real', 'end', 'whole', 'movie', 'overall', 'recommend', 'caveats', 'lot', 'grimly', 'authentic', 'male', 'behavior', 'movie', 'including', 'crudeness', 'violence', 'lots', 'swearing']",N/A

This movie does it all in an office where everybody wears suits.  But there's so much testosterone oozing out of their pores it could be a Rambo film if you closed your eyes.  And the way the actors pounce on their clients, there isn't enough left for a buzzard after they're done tearing into said clients.This movie deals with the world of high-pressure selling for stock brokerage firms.  These companies still exist, even after Enron, 9/11, and the stock market meltdown, but were thriving even more before all this happened.  Their tactic is to hard-sell customers on stocks for various new companies.  Only those that make the sales get the riches.  It doesn't matter that the stocks are from faltering, or worthless companies, you'd better buy, and buy a lot if they call you.So it's not surprising that after our hero (Ribisi) gets caught running a casino in his dorm room, it's here that he turns to for ""legitimate"" employment.  At first he goes with the lifestyle, and even becomes good at it.  By movie's end, though, certain characters see the harm they do to their suckers, er, clients, and certain characters have to make choices on how to proceed with their lives. Others will have this choice made for them.This movie is scary in that it really shows how these high-pressure salesmen work.  They wear suits, but they are the shiny sharkskin types that Billy Crystal in ""Analyze This"" mentioned could be used as mirrors.  So this brilliant piece of costuming tells you exactly what kind of people you are dealing with.  Vin Diesal in a suit, in a very good performance, looks just as menacing here as in his later roles.

The term `boiler room'  is an expression con artists use for a phone scam operation.  This  particular con just used stocks as the bait.  As a grift story, this was  extremely well done.  The concept as presented in the film is ingenious.  It is a double blind scam where neither the brokers nor the patsies know  there is a swindle going on.  The grifters hire nave kids and teach them  to be super high-pressure phone salesmen to push worthless stocks as bona  fide investments.  They think they are real brokers selling hot stocks,  when they are really just creating artificial demand, inflating the price  of specific stocks so the grifters can sell their shares at a huge profit.  They then move on to another stock, and without the artificial boost, the  price of the first stock plummets leaving the investors broke.We learn  early in the film (in the trailer actually) that the FBI is investigating  the operation and that they are planning a raid.  Therefore, the film is  really more about the culture of the operation than its eventual fate.  We  follow Seth (Giovanni Ribisi) through the training process to the point  where he becomes a broker.  We see how the firm manipulates him through  group acceptance, much the same way as religious cults control their  members.This film has been compared to `Glengarry Glen Ross' and `Wall  Street', with allusions to both within the film itself.  Of the two, it was  more like GGR; only it was a far more dynamic story.  First time  writer/Director Ben Younger (who at 27 lives up to his name), has captured  with a great deal of accuracy, the frenetic world of telephone stock sales;  the camaraderie and the adrenaline rush these brokers get when they close a  deal.  The reason the film works is that there is an element of truth to  the portrayal.  Legitimate brokers do make cold calls dangling stock tips  to try to hook new clients.  After they get the clients though, the good  ones advise their clients to diversify their portfolios rather than having  them dump all their money into one hot stock.  The danger here is that the  public will see a film like this and think that the type of corruption seen  here is common, which is false.From a filmmaking standpoint, the  cinematography was mundane, and I could have done without the syncopated  jump cuts to the beat of rap music, but the direction of the actors was  excellent.  Younger was superb at creating the manic feeling of the office  and the pumped up mentality of the brokers.  It seems he had a visceral  sense of how this should look and how the characters should behave.The  acting was tremendous, despite the young age of the cast.  This was a  breakout performance for Giovanni Ribisi.  He was intense, confident and  powerful in his portrayal of both the high flying broker and the wounded  son.  Ben Affleck was awesome as the god of trainee motivation,  intimidating and electrifying his eager young pups.  I thought he was far  better than Alec Baldwin, who played essentially the same role in  GGR.This was an excellent film.  It was a marvelous showcase for a lot  of young talent, in both the acting and the directing.  I rated it an 8/10.

I found the storyline interesting, if a bit beyond believability (but then, when I think of my friend's lives, if they were presented on screen, most likely they would not be believable, either). The milieu of the stock trading floor is wonderfully portrayed, and it isn't until well into the film that one realises that this is not, in fact, a `legitimate' stock brokerage, but rather, a `chop shop' in which dummy corporations issue public stock for the purpose of building capital which can then be kept as the stock value plummets.This is a film that fits the genre of not-quite-so-bad-guy-turns-good; the characterisations are fairly typical (mother, father, co-workers, etc.)-there is nothing really new here. There is an almost-happy ending, with the now-reformed good guy getting away just as the cavalry (in this case, the FBI) arrives to seize the bad guys. A fairly uni-dimensional film, do not go looking for deep insights or grand issues, or even great characters. But, it is a basic good story, something to give you an insight into trading floor personalities and the frenetic pace of activity that surrounds a high-powered brokerage.I must confess I did not like the soundtrack; in fact, I found it intrusive and irritating. It was designed, I'm sure, to accentuate the trading floor/lifestyle pace and hard-hitting nature of the business world. I guess there is a reason why I'm not a stock broker; of course, the stock brokers I know prefer Brahms and Mozart.Still, in all, I enjoyed this film. I can't say too much about, and am not quite sure why my overall opinion is one of enjoyment when there is so little explicitly redeeming about this film. I did, however, find Ben Afleck's bits in the film very interesting, particularly the job interview scene. I think I've interviewed at places like that before (except no one was telling me I would be a millionaire in three years).",4,Not quite bubbling...,1055462400,"06 13, 2003",2003,1935,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'found', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'bit', 'believability', 'then', 'when', 'think', 'friend', 'lives', 'were', 'presented', 'screen', 'most', 'likely', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'believable', 'either', 'milieu', 'stock', 'trading', 'floor', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', ""n't"", 'well', 'film', 'one', 'not', 'fact', 'legitimate', 'stock', 'brokerage', 'rather', 'chop', 'shop', 'dummy', 'corporations', 'issue', 'public', 'stock', 'purpose', 'building', 'capital', 'can', 'then', 'be', 'kept', 'stock', 'value', 'plummets.This', 'film', 'genre', 'not-quite-so-bad-guy-turns-good', 'characterisations', 'are', 'fairly', 'typical', 'mother', 'father', 'co-workers', 'etc', 'nothing', 'really', 'new', 'here', 'almost-happy', 'ending', 'now-reformed', 'good', 'guy', 'getting', 'away', 'just', 'cavalry', 'case', 'FBI', 'seize', 'bad', 'guys', 'fairly', 'uni-dimensional', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'looking', 'deep', 'insights', 'grand', 'issues', 'even', 'great', 'characters', 'basic', 'good', 'story', 'something', 'give', 'insight', 'trading', 'floor', 'personalities', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'activity', 'high-powered', 'brokerage.I', 'must', 'confess', 'did', 'not', 'soundtrack', 'fact', 'found', 'intrusive', 'irritating', 'was', 'designed', ""'m"", 'sure', 'accentuate', 'trading', 'floor/lifestyle', 'pace', 'hard-hitting', 'nature', 'business', 'world', 'guess', 'reason', 'why', ""'m"", 'not', 'stock', 'broker', 'course', 'stock', 'brokers', 'know', 'prefer', 'Brahms', 'Mozart.Still', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'am', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'overall', 'opinion', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'when', 'so', 'little', 'explicitly', 'redeeming', 'film', 'did', 'however', 'find', 'Ben', 'Afleck', 'bits', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'particularly', 'job', 'interview', 'scene', 'think', ""'ve"", 'interviewed', 'places', 'one', 'was', 'telling', 'would', 'be', 'millionaire', 'three', 'years']",N/A

I'm kind of young, so I had to watch it about three or four times to finally understand all of it, and I still don't get everything about those stupid rips, but I have it down pretty good. It was awesome. Seth Davis is played by Giovanni Ribisi, who is a very under-rated actor, and he plays his role perfectly.

38584,A1L43KWWR05PCS,0780631528,Lawyeraau,"[11, 16]","This is a Gen X version of the movie &quot;Wall Street&quot;. It is an uneven, though intriguing, debut by director Ben Younger. It is also a movie that promises much, but fails to deliver anything substantial. First off, it lures you by claiming that it stars Ben Affleck. While Ben Affleck may appear in the movie, it can hardly be said to star him. In fact, Affleck's role cannot even be said to rise to that of a supporting role, so ephemeral is it. Yet, all the trailers feature Affleck prominently, as if by promising to deliver him, it may make up for the deficiencies in the film. Nonetheless, Affleck does give a dynamic performance, however miniscule his part.On the plus side, however, there are some other performances of note. Vin Diesel's is one. He just keeps getting better and is one of the most versatile young actors of today, having had featured roles in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Pitch Black&quot;. Also, Giovanni Ribisi turns in a very good performance, as well, though it is not believable that the beautiful Nia Long would find him to be her type.The premise of the movie is simple. Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi) is a nineteen year old college drop out who runs an illegal casino out of his Kew Garden Hills, Queens, NY apartment. While he is making a tidy sum out of his illegal operation which is a mecca for bored Queens College students, Seth is a disappointment to his father (Ron Rifkin), who is a federal judge and fearful of becoming tainted through association by his son's illegal activities.Seth, wanting to make his father proud of him, tries to go legit and gets a job at a small brokerage firm whose owners (Ben Affleck and Thom Everett Scott) make get rich quick promises. Two senior brokers with the firm, Greg (Nicki Katt), who lured him to the firm, and Chris (Vin Diesel), who tries to look out for Seth while he cuts his eyeteeth, basically play a good cop/bad cop routine through out the film. Greg's former love interest, Abbey (Nia Long), the firm's $80,000 a year receptionist, turns to Seth for romance, much to Greg's annoyance. This creates tension between Seth and Greg for which Chris runs interference.Seth initially buys into the promises of big money and falls for the allure of mega bucks, hook, line, and sinker, becoming one of the most promising newcomers to the firm, only to discover that he has traded one illicit operation for another. It seems the firm is selling virtually worthless stock to unsuspecting individuals. When he looks to get out from under, turning to his disapproving father for help, he is rejected. His father, however, has a change of heart and reaches out to his son, only to become ensnared in his son's get rich quick debacle.

The musical score,  although carefully chosen to emphasize the crude, shallow, but ultra-cool  lives of the characters, also becomes annoying.  The few scenes where  customers are &quot;reeled&quot; in are completely unbelievable and  Affleck's scenes are especially aggravating - he chews the scenery but  rants obscenely about the obvious, talks about selling as if he came out of  a high-school marketing class, and his tough-guy tactics feel strained.  The climax of the film is predictable and the plot devices driving Seth  throughout the movie (the actual illicit mechanisms of the firm, for  example) are poorly elaborated and generally not believable.  The scenes  between Seth and his father are moving (although his father's change of  heart on certain issues late in the film seems contrived) and Nia Long is  excellent as Abby.  Abby's moments with Seth are involving and I wish there  had been more of their complex relationship in the film.

38591,A1V5G1O9TRGO7M,0780631528,matt,"[2, 4]","Boiler Room was a true let down for me.Not only did this film open with a fascinating first half, but it bosted two of today's best young stars, Vin  Diesel and Ben Affleck.  Boiler Room is a film about the power of greed and  the corruption of the soul.  The first 45 minues or so are wonderful as the  film's central character is essentially seduced into a shady stock  brokerage firm filled to the brim with money grubbing young men.The first  problem with Boiler Room is that it sets up most of the firm's brokers as  well dressed thugs.  They go out and get in fights almost nightly.  None of  these characters are very likable, and presenting them as thugs is hardly a  respectable decision.  It becomes harder and harder to take this film  seriously, in a world of business, these guys act like they stumbled out of  a college frat party.  Perhaps this is one of Boiler Room's major points,  to present the newest generation of 'yuppies' as cutthroats and scum.  Writer/Director Ben Younger does achieve a certain degree of ambiguity here  with this gimick, but Boiler Room completely crumbles away in its second  half.Giovanni Ribisi's character Seth briefly enjoys success at the firm  but becomes suspicious of it all too quickly.  Soon he discovers that his  firm is essentially a fraud and without giving too much away must  eventually choose to do the right thing for the right people.  This seemed  a silly plot twist for a film trying to be as sharp and truthful about this  new generation of 'businessmen', perhaps it's not very far fetched, but  Boiler Room's second half is as distracting and ridiculous as any Big  Hollywood film. We get a pointless romance with the firm's secretary and an  interesting but unnecessary relationship between father and son.  Add it  all up and Boiler Room turns out to be a well intentioned film with too  many half cooked ideas floating throughout.  An excellent cast tries hard,  but this Wall Street/ Glengarry Glen Ross inspired drama never really  achieves anything it sets out to, some intresting ideas rolled up into an  adolescant Wall Street do not a good movie make.",2,Not nearly as good as the films that inspired it.,966297600,"08 15, 2000",2000,2128,"['Boiler', 'Room', 'was', 'true', 'let', 'down', 'me.Not', 'only', 'did', 'film', 'open', 'fascinating', 'first', 'half', 'bosted', 'two', 'today', 'best', 'young', 'stars', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'film', 'power', 'greed', 'corruption', 'soul', 'first', '45', 'minues', 'so', 'are', 'wonderful', 'film', 'central', 'character', 'essentially', 'seduced', 'shady', 'stock', 'brokerage', 'firm', 'filled', 'brim', 'money', 'grubbing', 'young', 'men.The', 'first', 'problem', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'up', 'most', 'firm', 'brokers', 'well', 'dressed', 'thugs', 'go', 'out', 'get', 'fights', 'almost', 'nightly', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'presenting', 'thugs', 'hardly', 'respectable', 'decision', 'harder', 'harder', 'take', 'film', 'seriously', 'world', 'business', 'guys', 'act', 'stumbled', 'out', 'college', 'frat', 'party', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'major', 'points', 'present', 'newest', 'generation', ""'yuppies"", 'cutthroats', 'scum', 'Writer/Director', 'Ben', 'Younger', 'achieve', 'certain', 'degree', 'ambiguity', 'here', 'gimick', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'completely', 'away', 'second', 'half.Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'character', 'Seth', 'briefly', 'success', 'firm', 'suspicious', 'too', 'quickly', 'firm', 'essentially', 'fraud', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'must', 'eventually', 'choose', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'right', 'people', 'seemed', 'silly', 'plot', 'twist', 'film', 'trying', 'be', 'sharp', 'truthful', 'new', 'generation', ""'businessmen"", 'perhaps', 'not', 'very', 'far', 'fetched', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'second', 'half', 'distracting', 'ridiculous', 'Big', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'get', 'pointless', 'romance', 'firm', 'secretary', 'interesting', 'unnecessary', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'Add', 'up', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'out', 'be', 'well', 'intentioned', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'half', 'cooked', 'ideas', 'floating', 'excellent', 'cast', 'tries', 'hard', 'Wall', 'Street/', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'inspired', 'drama', 'never', 'really', 'anything', 'out', 'intresting', 'ideas', 'rolled', 'up', 'adolescant', 'Wall', 'Street', 'do', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'make']",N/A
38592,A152C8GYY25HAH,0780631528,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","Boiler Room is one of the flashiest and most intense dramas of the year, though the flash part becomes a bit much. It's hard to imagine that a subject like the stock market could be the subject of such a movie, but, like Wall Street, its themes are greed and corruption, which are always interesting. It is also the story of a young man who finds that life's roads can be rocky when you are lacking in morals and values. I don't mean religious morals or family values. I mean the basic, common ones that make society function properly. It is also a story of redemption.Seth Davis [Giovanni Ribisi] is a really bright young man. When the movie opens, we see him in the midst of his most successful business idea. He has two professional black jack tables in his New York townhouse, and his tiny casino is making him a lot of money. The operation is illegal, but at least Seth is running an honest game, one that is open to kids of any age with some bucks. Problems arise when he goes to his family's house for dinner. Somehow his father [Ron Rifkin], a Federal judge, has found out not only that Seth's dropped out of college, but also about his little operation. The father is typical of many, who love their sons, but do not know how to communicate with them except by ranting at them when they do wrong. Dad points out that Seth has put his judgeship in jeopardy, which is true, but guilt is never the best way to handle such situations. Seth loves his Dad but seems to suffer from what psychologists call adolescent maladjustment reaction, which means that when a child can't get attention for doing good, he or she may turn to getting it by doing bad.A few days later, an old friend of Seth's brings in a really high roller, who arrives in a new Ferrari. The new customer turns out to be a successful stockbroker, and the friend has just started working for the same company. Impressed by Seth's business smarts, the broker points out that at some point the casino will be busted. Why doesn't he come to work for his firm? Hoping to win his father's favor, Seth takes the job, even though from the first day, he instinctively knows something is amiss at this brokerage. For one thing, it's way out on Long Island instead of in Manhattan. The brokers call people they don't know and use high pressure tactics. A legit company never does this. The reason everyone is becoming millionaires is that the firm is paying commissions four times the legal limit in America. Seth sticks around, becoming the firm's top new recruit. Meanwhile, the guy is beginning to realize he possess something he didn't think he had - a conscious. This is where the dilemma comes in. Seth knows he has gone from the frying pan into the fire, but what about all that money? At this point, the movie gets really interesting. What about his future now? And what about his father?There are some flaws in Boiler Room. It is hard to believe that a corrupt company this large and flamboyant could operate so long undetected. I think the firm is a metaphor for our times, where the frenzy to get rich quick has become appalling. If so, this metaphor is not stated clearly enough for many viewers to get. Director Ben Younger must be from Hollywood's favorite new film school, the world of music videos. There is a point where jump shots and flashy editing go too far and serve as a reminder of the director's training and ego. On the plus side, much of the story is electric and engrossing. The cast is mainly composed of dedicated actors, like Ribisi, Vin Diesel and Nia Long, who seem to take what they consider to be the best roles, not necessarily the best paying ones.",3,Stock market expose has its high and lows,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,3645,"['Boiler', 'Room', 'one', 'flashiest', 'most', 'intense', 'dramas', 'year', 'flash', 'part', 'bit', 'much', 'hard', 'imagine', 'subject', 'stock', 'market', 'could', 'be', 'subject', 'such', 'movie', 'Wall', 'Street', 'themes', 'are', 'greed', 'corruption', 'are', 'always', 'interesting', 'also', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'roads', 'can', 'be', 'rocky', 'when', 'are', 'lacking', 'morals', 'values', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'religious', 'morals', 'family', 'values', 'mean', 'basic', 'common', 'ones', 'make', 'society', 'function', 'properly', 'also', 'story', 'redemption.Seth', 'Davis', '[', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', ']', 'really', 'bright', 'young', 'man', 'When', 'movie', 'see', 'midst', 'most', 'successful', 'business', 'idea', 'two', 'professional', 'black', 'jack', 'tables', 'New', 'York', 'townhouse', 'tiny', 'casino', 'making', 'lot', 'money', 'operation', 'illegal', 'least', 'Seth', 'running', 'honest', 'game', 'one', 'open', 'kids', 'age', 'bucks', 'Problems', 'arise', 'when', 'family', 'house', 'dinner', 'Somehow', 'father', '[', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', ']', 'Federal', 'judge', 'found', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'Seth', 'dropped', 'college', 'also', 'little', 'operation', 'father', 'typical', 'many', 'who', 'love', 'sons', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'communicate', 'ranting', 'when', 'do', 'wrong', 'Dad', 'out', 'Seth', 'put', 'judgeship', 'jeopardy', 'true', 'guilt', 'never', 'best', 'way', 'handle', 'such', 'situations', 'Seth', 'Dad', 'suffer', 'what', 'call', 'adolescent', 'maladjustment', 'reaction', 'when', 'child', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'attention', 'doing', 'good', 'may', 'turn', 'getting', 'doing', 'bad.A', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'old', 'friend', 'Seth', 'brings', 'really', 'high', 'roller', 'who', 'new', 'Ferrari', 'new', 'customer', 'out', 'be', 'successful', 'stockbroker', 'friend', 'just', 'started', 'working', 'same', 'company', 'Impressed', 'Seth', 'business', 'smarts', 'broker', 'out', 'point', 'casino', 'will', 'be', 'busted', 'Why', ""n't"", 'come', 'work', 'firm', 'Hoping', 'win', 'father', 'favor', 'Seth', 'job', 'even', 'first', 'day', 'instinctively', 'something', 'amiss', 'brokerage', 'one', 'thing', 'way', 'Long', 'Island', 'instead', 'Manhattan', 'brokers', 'call', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'use', 'high', 'pressure', 'tactics', 'legit', 'company', 'never', 'reason', 'everyone', 'becoming', 'millionaires', 'firm', 'paying', 'commissions', 'four', 'times', 'legal', 'limit', 'America', 'Seth', 'sticks', 'around', 'becoming', 'firm', 'top', 'new', 'recruit', 'Meanwhile', 'guy', 'beginning', 'realize', 'possess', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'conscious', 'where', 'dilemma', 'Seth', 'gone', 'frying', 'pan', 'fire', 'what', 'money', 'point', 'movie', 'really', 'interesting', 'What', 'future', 'now', 'what', 'father', 'are', 'flaws', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'hard', 'believe', 'corrupt', 'company', 'large', 'flamboyant', 'could', 'operate', 'so', 'long', 'undetected', 'think', 'firm', 'metaphor', 'times', 'where', 'frenzy', 'get', 'rich', 'quick', 'become', 'appalling', 'so', 'metaphor', 'not', 'stated', 'clearly', 'enough', 'many', 'viewers', 'get', 'Director', 'Ben', 'Younger', 'must', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'favorite', 'new', 'film', 'school', 'world', 'music', 'videos', 'point', 'where', 'jump', 'shots', 'flashy', 'editing', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'serve', 'reminder', 'director', 'training', 'ego', 'plus', 'side', 'much', 'story', 'electric', 'engrossing', 'cast', 'mainly', 'composed', 'dedicated', 'actors', 'Ribisi', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Nia', 'Long', 'who', 'seem', 'take', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'best', 'roles', 'not', 'necessarily', 'best', 'paying', 'ones']",N/A

Usually relegated to supporting, psycho types of roles, Ribisi does something few actors can effectively do:  he gives a brilliant performance in a role he is miscast in.  Ribisi plays Seth vitally well, but in no way does he truly fit the character.  As many reviewers have noted, would sexy Nia Long single him out of all those hunks to have a fling with?  Maybe she got tired of the good looks and empty brains and wanted a brain?  But even Seth is pretty stupid in how he fails to see the truth behind this assortment of hucksters.  Vin Diesel is revealing in his role, probably the only one he hasn't shown off his body in; Tom Everett Scott is wasted as the company's malevolent owner; Long looks pretty but she seems vacuous and unreal; Ben Affleck gives one of his best performances in his small but impressive role; Scott Caan and Jamie Kennedy don't get to do much but strut; and Taylor Nichols as Harry is marvelous.  Ron Rifkin does well as Seth's father, but his performance is undermined by a poorly written script, changing him from the father from Hell into an understanding patriarch.  His explanation of what happened when Seth had his bicycle accident borders on camp because it doesn't make any sense.  But Ribisi tries hard and does well as always. I hated the score; it did nothing but interfere and punctuate the fact that the best scores are ones written for the movie and provide INSTRUMENTAL accompaniment that forwards the plot, not hinders it.

His father despises him for all of the goof-ups he's made in his life (not to mention he isn't a very happy camper when he finds out about Seth's illegal card game operation).  Seth is willing to do just about anything to win back his father's approval and love.  And that's when he's dragged into the business world and is recruited to a small stock brokerage firm.  In very little time, he learns the ropes and is able to make sales without hesitation.  The only problem is there's a good chance that the firm he's working for is much, MUCH more illegal than any small-time card operation.  Seth's about to get a wake-up call from the business world, and it's not going to be a pretty sight.Having a very big &quot;Wall Street&quot; and &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; feel and influence to it, &quot;Boiler Room&quot; is an exciting and chilling look into the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; rule when it comes to business.  It still is successful at being its own movie.  There's a great story behind it all that is very believable and very convincing.  You don't have to know the business lingo to understand what takes place in the film.  While it's a complex story and plot, it's still clear to us exactly what's going on and what's happening.The film has some really good acting in it.  Giovanni Ribisi is perfect when it comes to playing Seth (he has a very childish and innocent look to him, which makes it easier for us to sympathize with him).  Vin Diesel is pretty good in the movie as well.  Nia Long is great as Seth's love interest and never misses a beat.  Everybody else in the movie is great as well.  The film has great direction and a solid story to back it up.The DVD has some pretty neat features.  The picture and sound quality is terrific.  Special features included are deleted scenes/alternate ending, commentary, isolated score with composer commentary, the original theatrical trailer, and some neat DVD-ROM features to add to the mix.&quot;Boiler Room&quot; is a great movie about the ruthless business world.  Even though this is fiction, this is something you can see happening anywhere.  If you like &quot;Wall Street&quot; or &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross,&quot; then I highly recommend this movie.

The film tells the story of Seth Davis, a decent college dropout earning a living by running a casino inside his house, much to the strong dismay of his frustrated judge father. In order to impress his dad, Seth takes on a job at a stock brokerage firm where he becomes a fast tracking stock broker and making good money. Only later does he find out that his job isn't what it's cracked up to be. The performances are strong, particularly from lead Ribisi and supporting characters Nicky Katt as a two faced co-worker,  Ron Rifkin as his dad, and Scott Caan as a hotheaded co-worker. Vin Diesel does quite well as the good guy to Ribisi's Davis. The film definitely has the testosterone feel of a Generation X movie with The Angel's rap/classical score.

Well, this film cons us all by making this old premise quite interesting and definitely worth anyone's time!  The biggest surprise of the film was Vin Diesel, playing a far different role from his usual tough-guy personas.  Oh, he's still tough, but the punching and violence are about 100% less and Diesel gets a chance to show off his fine acting chops.  I did think Ben Affleck was a bit bland and constantly trying to remind the audience that he didn't like our leading man, Giovanni Ribisi.  But even that wasn't too bad...certainly didn't cost this film a star.  While we've definitely seen this plotline before (i.e. The Firm), we're given interesting characters, we learn a thing or two about the stock market, and things are properly explained when they aren't quite what you'd expect (i.e. the brokerage firm's location about an hour away from Wall Street.)

No, the penny stock operators are way more subtle than that, though the portrayal of macho-salesmen is somewhat correct.  Booze, drugs, and prostitutes are part of that scene.

The story starts with Seth running a successful small-time casino out of his house much to the dismay of his father when he finds out. So Seth decides to start at the bottom and become a stockbroker trainee. Alas the brokerage house is a &quot;chop shop,&quot; one of those brokerages on the fringe that sell a variety of very risky and easily manipulated stocks to unsuspecting rubes over the phone. These include penny stocks, unregistered and letter stocks that the brokerage sells from its own inventory at a tremendous mark up. Seth starts as a cold caller while he studies for his series 7 exam (test for a broker license). Seth becomes very good at his job, but he knows something is very wrong about his employer, and that he is cheating people. But Seth is really a decent person after all and proves himself later.

Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel once again show why they're slowly replacing Affleck and perennial sidekick Matt Damon as the hottest young actors in Hollywood. Ben Younger cast this movie perfectly; unfortunately, that's about the only thing he did right.Younger's auspicious debut focuses on Seth Davis (Ribisi, probably best known to most as &quot;lightning boy&quot; from a memorable X-Files episode), a college dropout running an illegal casino in his living room. Pressured by his father (Ron Rifkin), a supreme court justice to stop his illegal activity, Seth is ripe for the plucking by his childhood friend Greg (Nicky Katt, now playing the hapless sub on Boston Public), who's a senior broker at a chop-shop style stock brokerage. Davis finds out he's very good at being a salesman, and while Greg turns a seemingly inexplicable cold eye to Seth, a rival senior broker, Chris (Diesel), takes Davis under his wing. Greg and Chris are the kinds of friends who are constantly on the edge of exploding into violence with constant putdowns; not surprising in a high-stress job like this.The whole firm is run by Jim Young (Affleck) and his pal Michael (Thom Everett Scott), and it becomes obvious to Davis as time goes on that something fishy is happening, but he finds this out while realizing that he's good at being fishy. This leads to an ethical crisis, and... well, see the movie.Ribisi, Diesel, and the usually-laconic Scott deliver the goods here in the best of ways. Affleck is his usual self, and one wonders if he'll ever play anything else. The ensemble cast-- and despite the focus on Ribisi's character, this is as much an ensemble movie as Glengarry Glen Ross or The Big Chill-- is perfect, and many of the minor characters (Nia Long, Scott Caan, and the woefully-underutilized Jon Abrahams) deliver performances up to the samestandard set by the big guns. But Younger takes a potentially explosive situation and, instead of focusing on the characters and their interactions through the whole movie, shoves that part of the dynamic to the back in the last half, opting instead for a stock plot. Perhaps Younger should have read King's book; focusing on his characters instead of plotting things out would almost certainly have resulted in a much better film, since that first hour shows he really does have a grasp of what makes humans work. Still, it's worth renting just to catch a few performances by stars who are definitely on their way to the top. ** 1/2",3,Ben?

I don't mean that it portrays reputable Wall Street firms, who would never do the things that this movie portrays.  But there are investment scam ""chop shop"" firms like the one in this movie that exist solely to bilk the public.  That is what this movie is about.Seth Davis is a young ""ne'er do well"" looking to start a career on Wall Street.  He joins a firm ""JT Marlin"" which promises him that if he works his tail off he will be driving a Porsche and living the good life.  It sounds too good to be true, and alas it is.  The flick really does a great job of showing how a ""boiler room"" scam might operate--maybe the movie actually helped educate the public, I don't know.  I do know that this movie is great entertainment. (In the movie it is explained that JT Marlin deliberately named itself to confuse the public with JP Morgan--note that JP Morgan is a reputable firm which would never do the things that this movie portrays.  But there are real JT Marlins out there screwing people.)Ben Affleck is hilarious as the JT Marlin firm Trainer--the guy responsible for turning young ignorant trainees into seasoned scamsters.  Some people have said that Affleck can't act--well, in this movie he is absolutely a scream; very effective and convincing.

38620,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0780631528,Roland E. Zwick,"[9, 14]","Genuine honest-to-God timeliness is a rarity in contemporary filmmaking. So many movies end up using topicality as mere window dressing to gussy up otherwise conventional screenplays that, when a film arrives on the scene  that is truly attuned to the truths of its time, it becomes something of a  revelation. How many recent thrillers, for instance, have simply turned to  high tech computer hardware in an attempt to infuse a little novelty into  stories that otherwise creak with old age?`Boiler Room' is a different  story altogether. Even though, at its most basic level, this film taps into  themes that trace their origins all the way back to the earliest ancient  Greek tragedies, somehow `Boiler Room' manages to convey a vision of the  world that is uniquely modern and chillingly contemporary in its character.  In this era in which Wall Street has become the new American icon and in  which even the most ill-informed common citizen is led to believe that he  can become a millionaire almost overnight with virtually no financial risk  merely by making a few shrewd investments in an ever-expanding stock  market, any number of opportunists crouch poised for the kill, ready to  spring on the unsuspecting investor and take him for all he is worth. This  is the world `Boiler Room' opens up to us.Commendably, writer/director  Ben Younger realizes (as so many others have not) that, in the world of  drama, moral ambiguity is always more fascinating than colorless,  good-vs.-evil simplicity. As a result, he has chosen, as the center of his  complex screenplay, a young man, Seth Davis, who is, from the first moment  we meet him, knee deep in the world of shady entrepreneurial skullduggery.  Having quit college to run an underground casino out of his off-campus  apartment, Seth jumps at the chance to move onto bigger and better things  when he is offered a position at an `off Wall Street' stock brokerage firm  that assures him he will be making a cool million dollars before his third  year with the company is up. Thus, Seth becomes a symbol for so many young  people today who have become so dazzled by the prospect of a near-instant  wealth that seems just within their grasp that they abandon all thoughts of  morality and decency in their blind race to the goal. And, indeed, one of  the most insidiously effective scenes in the film is the inspirational pep  talk that Ben Affleck delivers to the raw recruits at the beginning of the  film. So dazzling and convincing is the speech and so inspirational and  passionate its delivery that even we in the audience feel like we are  missing out on a great thing. For, of course, Seth slowly learns that all  is not true-blue and on the up-and-up in this firm as he discovers that he  is indeed involved with a financial `chop shop' whose sole business it is  to rip off weak, vulnerable and unsuspecting men looking for a few good  investments.What is most admirable about this film is that, as Seth  begins to realize the truth of the situation, he doesn't turn suddenly  noble and righteous as he might in the hands of a less sophisticated  author. Instead, he begins to think of ways to benefit himself financially  by betraying the very scammers who have taken him into their operation. In  fact, it is only after he is arrested by the FBI that Seth finally sees the  need to do the right thing and to make restitution to the two men whose  lives he has truly ruined - a young Wisconsin man whose marriage crumbles  after he allows Seth to talk him into blowing his new-home down payment on  a phony stock and Seth's own father, a morally upright federal judge, who  in a moment of filial weakness, tries to help Seth with an illegal action  and ends up getting implicated in the FBI probe as a result. However, Seth  is not a thoroughly bad person; he is neither ruthless nor heartless, yet  he has an enormous ability to rationalize his immoral actions within the  common framework of achieving that instant wealth he somehow feels he is  owed, despite the fact that his father certainly does not reflect that  thinking. In fact, the relationship between Seth and his father underlines  the moral complexity of Younger's tale. We feel for Seth because he has  lived his whole life yearning to earn his father's respect yet making all  the wrong choices in his quest to garner it. Yet, we also empathize with a  father, caught between trying to model a sense of moral rectitude and  maintain his own spotless reputation as a judge yet, at the same time,  desiring to provide help for his child in need.And these are, after all,  little more than twenty-something children dressed up as adults, an  incongruity that Younger captures with uncanny brilliance. Despite the fact  that they are involving themselves in million dollar deals and ruining  countless lives in the process, these `men' have advanced little beyond the  stage of frat-boy rambunctiousness in their behavior. We see them erupting  into fistfights at local yuppie bars with similarly well-dressed members of  a competing firm; we hear, pouring liberally out of their mouths,  vehemently racist, woman-bashing and gay-bashing comments that solidify the  exclusiveness of the world to which they belong; we witness them reciting  verbatim, almost as if it were Holy Scripture, lines of dialogue from the  movie that has become an emblem for their generation - not `Star Wars' but  Oliver Stone's `Wall Street.'And, just as Younger forces us to identify  with the hunger these men have for instantaneous financial success, he,  even more effectively, helps us to identify with the poor ill-informed  schmucks who are at the other end of the phone, being railroaded into  making decisions they feel powerless to control. So bedazzled are they (and  we) by the dizzying barrage of alien terminology pouring forth from the  other end of the receiver that capitulation seems inevitable. For its  glimpse into the inner workings of boiler rooms alone, the film earns its  kudos as a fascinating experience.The outstanding cast is headed by  Giovanni Ribisi, who creates a subtle portrait of a young man torn between  his better angels - in the form of his own innate conscience and a  beautiful young woman who is also a part of the firm - and the bitter  demons of a morally bankrupt, value-free grab for instant wealth. The  remainder of the cast is equally impressive. There is literally in this  film, not a single character of potential `goodness' - not Seth, not the  firm's secretary (Nia Long), not Seth's parents - who is not, at one point  or another, forced to confront a great moral dilemma and found wanting.  This is the kind of narrative courage that defines `Boiler Room' from  beginning to end.",4,brave view of modern morality,965865600,"08 10, 2000",2000,6749,"['Genuine', 'honest-to-God', 'timeliness',

On that basis it would seem that there's  very little to recommend the movie, but it actually is much better than  that.Giovanni Ribisi (Saving Private Ryan) stars as a young college  dropout who becomes a junior broker at J. T. Marlin after being introduced  to a senior broker by a mutual friend.  Soon, Ribisi's character starts  climbing his way up the ladder and becomes an self-assured alpha male  aggressively selling worthless stock.  Soon he begins to find out that  everything is not what it seems.The pacing of this picture can best be  described as frenetic, set to a hip-hop background.  The brokers are loud  and aggressive, with more than a touch of arrogance.  A secondary story  line involving a conflict between Ribisi's character and his father (played  by Ron Rifkin) seemed pointless and could have been deleted in the  interests of resolving questions that arise at the somewhat abrupt ending  of the film.  Ribisi turns in a decent performance, although I really  didn't find it to be credible.  Vin Diesel, on the other hand, steals the  show.  Ben Affleck is very good in a somewhat limited role, and the  considerable talents of Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You Do!) were  seriously underutilized.Overall &quot;Boiler Room&quot; is a good, but  not great, motion picture.  Among movies of the same general subject matter  it's better than &quot;Wall Street&quot;, but not as good as  &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;.  Look for the scene in which the J. T.

But running an illegal casino in his apartment isn't going to get it, so he shuts it down and takes a job with the stockbrokers of J.T. Marlin in an effort to go legit. Here in the high-pressure world of stock sales, Seth thrives. He's good at it. But will his father finally approve, or has Seth moved from one gambling business to another?My Opinion: I liked Boiler Room. This was mainly due to the stars Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel both of who are excellent in this movie. I am a big fan of both of these actors and they do net let down here. The camaraderie between the guys in the group of brokers that Seth calls his friends is very believable. It makes you care what happens to them. The pressure in the boiler room of the sales office is palpable. It comes off the screen and grabs you. The relationship between Seth and his father is what drives Seth. He is drawn to his father's approval like a moth to a flame. But this moth knows better and can't help himself. The plot progresses in a believable and logical fashion leaving no holes. The direction leaves nothing to be desired. In the end, I found the movie to be very entertaining and I enjoyed it completely.DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen anamorphic - 1.85:1  Sound: Decent with a cool soundtrack.  Extras:  Trailer, Commentary, Deleted Scenes and Alternate ending that flesh out the story. Menus: Basic.What You Should Do:  Rent this one to make sure you like it before a purchase.

With promises of his first million within three years, Seth gets into the high tension and fast paced world of the boiler room, the salesroom floor where he begins as a trainee. He gradually grows within the organization and starts seeing the beautiful receptionist Abbie (Nia Long) despite the fact that she used to be with his new boss. Everything seems to be going his way; however the deeper he goes, Seth begins to suspect that it can't all be as good as it looks and is unlikely to be as legal as he had been told it was.  It might be the fact that the film actually name checks ""Glengary Glen Ross"" and ""Wall Street"", but at times this feels that, like its characters, that it has watched these films too many times and has simply added a touch of ""Goodfellas"" to it to produce ""Boiler Room""; however, this is actually a bit unfair because the film has just about enough of its own to stand out as rather an enjoyable and interesting look at the ethics of certain sections of the business world.  The narrative is strong enough to keep things moving forward despite the weaknesses asYounger does well to recreate the testosterone-fuelled world where money is the only thing that matters and it tends to be this energy that drives the film where subplots on relationships struggle.The cast are a great help, featuring generally good performances despite the odd weak bit. Ribisi is the heart of the film and, although he doesn't totally convince in his narration he is a good lead, taking well to his character. Diesel usually strikes fear deep into hearts with his assumed hunky machismo, but here he is actually pretty good as is the sensitive Katt. Long is a good actress and great looking but this is not the best role she has had; she delivers it the best she can but the story uses her as a device at best, Caan is decent, and Rifkin has a simple task to deliver. The only bum note was Ben Affleck, whose dialogue comes off as a copy of better films was obviously done much better by Alec Baldwin in ""Glengary Glen Ross"".

This movie may reside in the contrasts of the 1987 hit &quot;Wall Street&quot; for many people, but I think it's better than that.  First-time director Ben Younger does a great job with a distinguished cast and a sometimes slow plot.Seth Davis (Ribisi) is one of the people you have to love.  He's rebelious, he's a dreamer, and he's smart.  By running an illegal casino out of his apartment, he's able to obtain a living, and a good one at that.  And when an old friend drops in on him to offer him a job he can't refuse, the story takes shape.  The job he is offered is to become a stock broker.  He'd have to start training for it, but eventually somewhere down the line he'd become rich.  All this information is given to him by the owner, or 'motivator', played by none other than Ben Affleck.  About 1.5 of the 3 stars given to this movie are because of Affleck's speech towards the beginning of this movie.  I love it.  The way he explains the job and the job's benefits using curse words and Lexus-payment analogies could make anyone want to become a stock broker.  I probably rewind the part twice each time I watch the movie.  But maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, the entire movie is great; not just that part.  And aside from the appearance of Ben Affleck, the movie gives us more actors galore.  &quot;XXX&quot; star Vin Diesel co-stars as Chris Varick, who sort of takes Seth under his wing and shows him some well-deserved respect.  Also, there's funnyman Jamie Kennedy, Scott Caan (who teamed up with Ribisi in &quot;Gone In 60 Seconds&quot; of the same year), and Nia Long.Once you get past Affleck's infamous speech and the stellar cast of stars, there's actually a good movie.  The plot is well-developed and the ending is really fitting.  I'm not going to say much about the ending but I will say it's similar to that of &quot;Wall Street&quot;; maybe slightly better.  In conclusion, Giovanni Ribisi proves he can handle a starring role.  And he doesn't need the perfect story to make it work.  If you liked &quot;Wall Street&quot; or if you like Ben Affleck, you will view this movie as a wonderful piece of film.  I'm sure you'll love it.
