1152202,A19ATJSKDZD9EZ,B001662FKK,"Adam Stapleton ""drunken sailor""","[1, 2]","Going into The Signal, I wasn't sure what to think. Was it going to be a rip off of Stephen King's lame zombie book Cell, would it be a creative and original independent movie filmed in my home town?The answer lies somewhere in the middle, but The Signal is without a doubt a triumph in the field of independent cinema and serves as a great example of what a few determined aspiring filmmakers can accomplish when they work hard enough.A few things to note about this movie. One: It's broken into three segments each directed by a different person. Two: Don't expect a formulaic Hollywood type plot where you are spoonfed what's happening, that isn't the point of the movie. You should look at the Signal as one of those pleasant surprises that you find yourself watching late at night on IFC or Sundance.That said, I must also stress that this movie is also not a typical ""art flick"" either.The story breaksdown like this:A woman is cheating on her husband when a mysterious signal begins broadcast over television and radio essentially turning everyone who watches it or hears it long enough into a raving lunatic.Don't confuse the victims' lunacy with the rage virus from 28 Days Later, these people are still intelligent and can even be reasoned with to a degree in some instances, they're just stark raving mad, which makes for some funny moments during the second portion of the film.Don't expect too much of an ending though and enjoy the film's unique premise and take on the idea of mass insanity and you will come out feeling as though watching was time well spent.The soundtrack is also worth mentioning with a good cover of the Joy Division classic Atmosphere playing throughout.Also of note, great work from all of the amatuer actors involved in the project, they serve as great examples of the fact that you don't need big names to make a good film and in fact the majority of the time fresh faces actually make a movie even better.",4,Solid little independent horror film,1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,1946,"['Going', 'Signal', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'Was', 'going', 'be', 'rip', 'Stephen', 'King', 'lame', 'zombie', 'book', 'Cell', 'would', 'be', 'creative', 'original', 'independent', 'movie', 'filmed', 'home', 'town', 'answer', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'Signal', 'doubt', 'triumph', 'field', 'independent', 'cinema', 'great', 'example', 'what', 'few', 'determined', 'aspiring', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'accomplish', 'when', 'work', 'hard', 'few', 'things', 'note', 'movie', 'One', 'broken', 'three', 'segments', 'directed', 'different', 'person', 'Two', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'formulaic', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'plot', 'where', 'are', 'spoonfed', 'what', 'happening', ""n't"", 'point', 'movie', 'should', 'look', 'Signal', 'one', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'find', 'watching', 'late', 'night', 'IFC', 'Sundance.That', 'said', 'must', 'also', 'stress', 'movie', 'also', 'not', 'typical', 'art', 'flick', 'story', 'breaksdown', 'woman', 'cheating', 'husband', 'when', 'mysterious', 'signal', 'begins', 'broadcast', 'television', 'radio', 'essentially', 'turning', 'everyone', 'who', 'long', 'enough', 'raving', 'lunatic.Do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'victims', 'lunacy', 'rage', 'virus', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'intelligent', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'reasoned', 'degree', 'instances', ""'re"", 'just', 'stark', 'raving', 'mad', 'funny', 'moments', 'second', 'portion', 'film.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'ending', 'though', 'enjoy', 'film', 'unique', 'premise', 'take', 'idea', 'mass', 'insanity', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'feeling', 'watching', 'was', 'time', 'well', 'spent.The', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'good', 'cover', 'Joy', 'Division', 'Atmosphere', 'playing', 'throughout.Also', 'note', 'great', 'work', 'amatuer', 'actors', 'involved', 'project', 'serve', 'great', 'examples', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'big', 'names', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'fact', 'majority', 'time', 'fresh', 'actually', 'make', 'movie', 'even', 'better']",N/A

1152208,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001662FKK,B. E Jackson,"[2, 4]","Wow, am I *really* disappointed with the Signal.  What starts out like it's going to be a REALLY freaky horror film completely falls flat after 30 minutes when the storyline takes a 180 and never returns to the horror elements that made it work so wonderfully in the beginning.In the beginning you see a woman sleeping with a guy and cheating on her husband.  Before walking through the door of the apartment building while returning home to her husband, she sees a bunch of weird creepy people roaming the halls of the building in which she lives, in addition to the previous scene where a man is seen bleeding from the chest and begging for help before the woman leaves the parking lot.So far, so good.When she walks inside her apartment room, she sees her husbands friends (or roommates) trying to fix a strange signal on the living room TV screen.  She questions what the heck is going on in the hallways outside that is making everyone act crazy.  So far I'm *loving* the storyline.  At this point I get the feeling the atmosphere is going to be suspenseful similar to how so many successful zombie films work.The husband basically forces his wife to the back bedroom where he questions her whereabouts hard and heavy.  He asks where she was, who she was with, etc.  She tells him she was with friends, but well... we all know she was cheating on her husband.  That's why she can't look him in the eye!Then a conflict develops between the husband and one of his/their roommates.  You see, the one roommate swings a baseball bat around chaotically, and while doing so he almost hits the guys wife.  This upset the husband VERY much to the point that the husband tells his wife to go get a shower.  Well upon opening the bathroom door to leave, she sees her husband beating the poor guy to death with his very own baseball bat rather violenty in a gruesome and memorable scene.  She gets extremely upset.  This leads to her immediately leaving the room and running around the hallways looking for a way to escape.Then down the hall -while trying to open her neighbors door in order to find a hiding spot- she sees a man brutally killing a woman on the floor about 50 feet away, which prompts her to try and open the door even faster.  She eventually does, and another death sequence occurs involving a woman living inside of that apartment room.  Don't turn your back, lady!  She steps over the dead woman and manages to get the door shut *just* in time so the guy isn't able to get the opportunity to attack her.  The next morning arrives and the girl is sitting on the floor completely terrified.  Eventually she finds the courage to escape.  So far I'm strongly believing this is going to be a REALLY awesome movie.After that, or more specifically a car accident segment, the entire film falls *completely* apart.  I can't really understand just what the movie writers were going for concerning the second half, unless the entire point of the storyline is just to play a huge, unnecessary mind game on all the viewers maybe in an attempt to avoid the predictability factor of the TV and radio signal capabilities interfering with people's minds and making everyone go crazy.  Perhaps the writers feared the Signal would become just another typical horror film and wanted to avoid that by any means necessary.Or possibly the writers were trying to add some detective-like mystery to the storytelling and assumed it would work.  In this context perhaps it works to an extent.  My gut feeling tells me the writers were going for a parody of the horror genre however.  The problem is that they completely fooled everyone in a way that was totally wrong.  Placing the Signal under the horror section of the video store is one major problem.  Making us sit through 30 minutes of believable horror only to take the writing in a way that either blends parody and mystery is a bigger mistake.  It's misleading.  Funny for the writers maybe; not for us. Whatever the intention, it simply did NOT work for me at all, and the Signal completely misses the mark as a result.Obviously those strange signals appearing on the TV screens around the city make everyone lose their minds and prompts everyone to enter ""kill mode"".  Maybe the writers believed this particular horror element *alone* was just too cheesy or too easy to predict for storyline purposes so they felt the need to dramatically change it, I don't know.Anyway, here's what happens during the second half.  A LOT of confusion.  A completely different storyline than what we saw during the first half.  Most people probably won't like it and will feel completely letdown, that's for sure.  If you're really attentive you can ""sort of"" follow it I suppose.It's about the womans husband and the man she's sleeping with both coming into contact with each other, and constantly questioning which one really IS the womans husband.  This is such an unbelievably bizarre change of direction that I can't find the proper words to explain what the writers were thinking... and it takes up WAY too much unnecessary time.  This goes beyond parody or storyline consistency- it's now total confusion.Honestly, the only thing all that constant questioning the two men did was most likely confuse everyone watching the movie.  Now it becomes extremely hard to know whether it's the husband or the cheater who's actually married to the woman.  Yup, the storyline has now changed into something significantly less frightening and radically different, and it never really stops either.  It definitely doesn't change back to what initially made the film so good in the first place.Furthermore, prepare to see a lot of impossible to understand scenes involving people being shoved into the ground and kicked and smacked repeatedly in the second half because they're receiving TV messages that tell them do carry out these horrible acts.  This just adds even MORE confusion to the giant mystery that is the second half of the Signal.  People getting attacked inside this one home over and OVER again for no clear reason- ugh, make it stop!The woman we see in the beginning suddenly transforming or disappearing into a separate brown-haired woman in the flash of a camera change during the beginning of the second chapter is totally mysterious too.  When she gets attacked and sprayed in the eyes and mouth with poison as the husband demandingly questions where his wife is... another layer of confusion presents itself (not to mention this scene is entirely uncomfortable to watch due to the disturbing torturous nature of hurting an innocent woman).  At least the theme that a poisonous radioactive signal is corrupting the minds of people remains intact throughout the movie, even though the tone and writing takes a dramatic turn (for the worse).Maybe you'd be able to appreciate the highly unusual change of storyline that takes place a quarter of the way through, and maybe you'll actually understand what's going on during the second half.  To me the second half just seems like constant pointless bickering between two guys fighting for the girl they love but done so in a twisted, confusing and overbearingly violent way.  I do like the scene where the husband being the violent signal-obsessing freak he's become, gets his arm screwed into a door with a screw gun, haha.  However a major storyline-killing exaggeration occurs right before this when a group of guys is shown trying to hook up a guys head and make it function, assuming he can speak and understand words like he used to when he had a body.  This particular part is so outrageous and cartoon-ish that it would have been better had it not been included.However I suppose if I'm in a really open-minded and forgiving mood, I'd be able to ignore the lack of logical storyline progression and the false misleading idea that this is supposed to be based entirely around horror and focus on a warped, unpredictably written film.  Make that an *incredibly* open-minded mood!  With all this said, my 3-star rating is fair I believe, because I can sense a bit of cleverness in the writing.Even though I personally don't get it, at least it's a commendable effort on the part of the writers to try and deliver with something original by combining several different genres together and trying to form one story around it, though it's clearly presented as a big mess more often than not.  Originality can be found here, so at least the Signal has that going for it.  Seriously though, if there was ever a movie that's not for everyone, it's the Signal.",3,disappointing is the key word here,1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,8548,"['Wow', 'am', '*really*',

There are three distinct sections: The first section is a serious zombie film.  The claustrophobic opening takes place in an apartment building as, through the eyes of some of the residents, we see the crisis become more and more apparent as the mayhem grows and the corridors more and more spattered with blood.  In some ways it reminded me of the opening of Dawn of the Dead or 28 Days Later.  The second section then comes along and surprises you with its many comic elements.  I have always felt comedy and horror worked well together.  In this particular instance it uses the blend of the genres to great effect with the comedy actually reinforcing the horror and vice versa.  You find yourself letting your guard down with the humour, only to be hit once again with shocks.  It is a far more mature and effective blending of the two then any of the Evil Dead films.  The third section is probably where it will falls apart for most viewers.  This section very much reminded me of early Cronenberg, with the urban decay and stark modern settings, not to mention all the TV screens, etc.  The first two sections mesh a bit better than the third since the first two are united by gorey, adrenalin driven, visceral horror, only for the third part to replace this with a more artsy, sedate, intellectual (but still suspenseful and moody) approach.  While I appreciate that section on its own, I wish it would have fit in better with the rest of the film, but it does get into the cause of the crisis and gives it an explanation no more pretentious than 28 Days Later's ""rage"".

1152212,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B001662FKK,Brian A. Schar,"[2, 3]","""The Signal"" is a decent movie, well-done for its low budget.  Its biggest flaw is that it's uneven.  It's not an anthology movie, but each act is written and directed by someone different, with the same characters.  The first act is OK, and manages to generate an atmosphere of dread and chaos pretty effectively, even with a bit too much herky-jerky editing.  It doesn't do as well with character, making act 1 somewhat lackluster.  Then Act 2 begins, and the movie shifts from OK to awesome in about 15 seconds.  Act 2 is by far the best segment of the movie, generating the best character moments of the movie.  After act 1, it's a welcome relief.  The most problematic act is Act 3, which is also OK, but seems worse after the greatness of act 2.  The ending is unclear; I'm OK with that, given that we learn that the signal interferes with the perception of reality.As my wife pointed out, ""The Signal"" bears some resemblance to ""Cloverfield,"" in that it focuses on characters who don't really have any knowledge of the McGuffin and aren't involved in stopping it.  It's an ideal POV for a cheap movie, but it leaves questions unanswered.  Ultimately, we don't really need to know what the signal is or where it came from, though, and ""The Signal"" was probably wise to leave those questions alone.

1152214,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001662FKK,Chris Pandolfi,"[21, 26]","""The Signal"" is the work of natural independent filmmakers, and it shows because they focus on actual storytelling instead of unimportant details. You watch it without analyzing anything--you just let the story happen, and you take it for almost everything it's worth. The surprising thing is that it achieves all this despite being a supernatural thriller, a genre notorious for trying to explain everything; here's a story that explains virtually nothing yet still manages to be both understandable and frightening. The basic idea seems unnerving enough, if a little too reminiscent of Stephen King's ""Cell"": in the fictional city of Terminus (whose very name must be symbolic), a signal sent through television sets on New Year's Eve makes anyone watching it irrational, paranoid, psychotic, and homicidal. This signal, wherever it came from, distorts perceptions of reality and makes the victim see things that aren't there and understand things that make no sense. As a result, people kill each other left and right for no apparent reason. They have The Crazy in their heads.In the midst of this chaos are three main characters caught in a bizarre love triangle, and this is fitting since the film is divided into three distinct sections, or in this case, transmissions. The first, called ""Crazy in Love,"" introduces us to Mya (Anessa Ramsey) and Ben (Justin Welborn), who are secretly having an affair. Ben awakens in the middle of the night and notices his TV, which he thought had been turned off; not only is it on, the screen shows nothing but patterned white static, as well. Then Mya awakens, and when she realizes what time it is, she hurriedly dresses and heads for home. She knows something's wrong as soon as she enters the building because almost everyone is awake, and they argue with one another as they wander the halls. When she enters her apartment, she first sees two of her husband's friends struggling to fix the TV's reception (they want to watch the baseball game). She then faces her husband, Lewis (AJ Brown), and at that point, we immediately know two things: (1) Lewis has already been affected by the signal; (2) his need to domineer was amplified--but not created--by the signal.The second transmission is called ""The Jealously Monster,"" and it's the weakest because it relies on quirky comedy instead of subtler moments of satire. This is when we meet Anna (Cheri Christian), and we immediately see that she has killed her husband. We also see that she's disappointed over not being able to throw a New Year's Eve party; as her husband's body sits across from her, she tells him that, when the guests arrive, she'll just tell them to leave. Her neighbor, Clark (Scott Poythress), stops by before long, as does Lewis, who uses his profession as an exterminator as an excuse to enter. Lewis is now on a mission to recapture his wife, a mission so obsessive that he doesn't trust anyone. He also sees Mya in place of Anna and kills almost anyone who comes near her. Even when he realizes who's who, he remains convinced that Anna knows where Mya has gone. He also has a powerful influence over Clark, who shifts between understanding the signal and being its unwilling pawn.The third segment is called ""Escape from Terminus,"" and if you think that title gives away the ending, you've got another thing coming. This segment wisely veers away from intentional humor, focusing once again on the desperate situation the characters are in. There are two notable exceptions, and while I won't describe them in detail, I will say that one involves aluminum foil and the other involves a severed head. By now, Clark and Ben are trying to intercept Mya before Lewis can, which will be difficult since all three men have been affected by the signal to a certain degree. It's really a question of will power, of knowing what to focus on and how to push irrational thoughts aside. Clark and Ben theorize that the signal is a kind of programmer, sending messages that trick the brain into believing what it shouldn't believe. It's pretty likely that this is a social commentary on television in general. Let's look at the obvious example of reality shows: they influence viewers into a primal state of competition, encouraging votes for the best singer, or the best dancer, or the best model.It's also pretty likely that the film is a commentary on the state of humanity in general. Consider the fact that it opens with footage of a schlocky exploitation film, much like Wes Craven's ""Last House on the Left"": we slowly begin to realize that the needless violence of that footage is being echoed in the plot of ""The Signal,"" with numerous, brutal murders that are justified only in the minds of the Crazies. The only way this film departs from films like ""Last House on the Left"" is that it focuses more on the aftermath than on the actual killing. Yes, violent deaths are featured, but we see more spilt blood than blood being spilt, if you get my drift. I suspect that the three writers and directors--David Bruckner, Dan Bush, and Jacob Gentry--did this on purpose, which is fine by me; lingering shots of blood and gore may be fun to look at, but they don't really add much as far as the story is concerned. But story is exactly what ""The Signal"" focuses on, making for one of the more original thrillers of recent memory. Instead of going for obvious, cheap thrills, it's ambitious enough to be unnerving and unpredictable. That's exactly the way a supernatural thriller should be, even with the occasional lapse into unnecessary comedy.",4,Do Not Attempt to Adjust Your Set--We Are in Control,1203984000,"02 26,

It seems like Hollywood is so intent on remaking almost any 1980's horror film, or Americanizing that latest Japenese Ghost story, originality has been pushed to the backburner. ""The Signal"" stands out not only with a pretty original story (I was expecting a rip-off of Stephen King's ""Cell"" novel, but any similarity is only a passing one), it's filmed in a unique way, and is presented in a fun format. Basically, take some of the elements of ""28 Days Later"", mix in some ""Pulp Fiction"", and add large doses of ""Shaun of the Dead"" type humor and you have ""The Signal"". The gore level and special effects will satisfy the gore hound, with beheadings, head smashes, and a great scene involving an arm getting screwed to the wall!! But don't let the gore be a turn-off for you if you are not into the red stuff. For all of the gory scenes there are quite a few that will have you laughing out loud. The film makers seem to have struck a perfect balance with ""The Signal"".I strongly caution you to be wary of some of the reveiws posted here that provide spoilers. I had no idea what this film was about, just popped it and sat back for the ride. It's a truly ""fun"" horror film, that will have you chuckling one moment and cringing the next.

For the good first 15-25 minutes, you're going to be like ""what is going on here"", it makes you want to keep watching to find out what happens next.Now how would I describe ""The Signal, well, in a nutshell, the Signal is ""a disapperance from the real world in your mind in a crazy, psychotic kind of way and no way to get out of it."" You go into the eyes of these characters with something infecting their brain without knowing the real cause, making them all basically ""immorally out of control.""It's defintely a nutjob from the start and you can't help to say ""this is the weirdest thing I've ever seen"" will defintely be pulsating through your mind watching this very peculiar film.  Without getting into detail about the plot, and without giving things away, just know this film messes with the viewers head. And for the most part, it succeeds. You can say it's along the lines of the bombardment of the ""zombie"" genre we've perhaps heard of or seen before, But ""The Signal"" is nothing like say"" a ""Dawn of the Dead"", it's not even close.In a more psychological fashion, The Signal puts the viewer in the minds of these people with their now contaminated minds. From start to finish you wonder where the movie takes you but unfortunately, it doesn't give a satisfactory ending for the viewer. So yes, it leaves you severely hanging, with no explanations, no answers for the terrible things going on in this city and why this was happening to these once normal people.  Dont' get me wrong, a lot of the movie is very well done and certainly watchable for fans of violence in general. Very good special effects, decent, yet sometimes obscure musical score, and the fine acting is also worth a valuable mention, but the plot just doesn't mesh as well with everything else going right in the movie. One of the main issues is the lack of locales you have to sit through.  The film keeps in you in a seemlingly clostrophobic state by keeping you compressed to a measly 2 apartment complexes during the entire length of the film, which drove me nuts after the first hour. I wanted to move on to the next setting, but it just never takes off. You, the viewer, feel so confined to these sometimes boring environments, it makes you ache for more answers on what else is going on out there, but keeps you confined to the lead characters and nobody else.Lame locations, a bit of a slow start and unanswered questions will leave you wanting a sequel and who knows, the story makes it easy for more to come, so.

Split apart into three segments by three different directors, The Signal details the story of a bizarre signal sent out through televisions, radio, and cell-phones that turns people into homicidal maniacs.  Caught in the middle are Mya (Anessa Ramsey) and her lover Ben (Justin Welborn), as well as Mya's insane husband Lewis (AJ Bowen) among others.  What The Signal manages to do very well is orchestrate levels of chaos and dread while keeping the suspense, and blood, pumping.  This is one of the few films where you actually will not be expecting what to happen next, which in itself is refreshing.  What stops The Signal from being a perfect horror dirge however is that having three writers/directors splitting the film into segments makes for an inconsistent quality.  As the Amazon review states, the film goes from frightening and interesting to very darkly humerous and then concludes in a bit of a bleak climax.  Still, The Signal manages to leave an impression, and it is incredibly refreshing to see an original horror film trying to do something different.  And it's even better when it works out as well as The Signal manages to do.

See the Shaun Of the Dead movie for a much much better horror comedy. Even the somewhat better, but still bad, Right At Your Door instead for that modern horror appeal. 28 Days Later is also ripped off by this movie and would be a much better way to spend your time, even if you seen those movies before.I DO NOT Recommend this movie at all! 0 stars!

The horror is coming from within, triggered by substances, signals and little spores from space.  From Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" to Scott Sigler's ""Infection: A Novel"", we are a plot point away from killing each other.  Now the signals come from big plasma TVs, phones and radio.  This is the first attempt I know of a ""zombie"" film trying to take the distorted point of view of those affected by the infection.  This makes for some narrative problems, as a difficulty to relate to any of the people escaping the city of Terminus and a relentless drive towards incoherent film-making.  The film is divided in three different sections with different tones each, which is not a bad thing if the shift between the first two was not so distracting.  In a longer movie with a bigger scope, the crazy comedy of the second segment could have been a cute interlude to the horror.  Now that I think about it, this segmented format can be developed as a series: different stories around the fateful day the signal reached our brains, maybe something similar to Satoshi Kon's ""Paranoia Agent"".

1152236,A1NKJJCBBYVP4V,B001662FKK,"Philip C. Perron ""Philip""","[1, 2]","Well, here's a well hyped film that starts out promising and actually ends pretty well yet fails miserably in the middle (but for reasons you wouldn't think).  Unfortunately this is a result of a middle which doesn't fit with the rest of the film causing this flick to be, though a nice little horror film, a failure.The film is a take on the zombie genre but twists it with a very original spin (unless you're Stephen King).  Rather than having folks being infected by a virus or folks that have risen from the dead, we have a signal (similar to white noise) that one night comes across the television turning folks into crazies, disturbed, or simply brain dead (think of Stephen King's novel Cell but with a television rather than a cellphone).  So though some folks turn into harmless nuts, a great many become violent murderers or hallucinatory crazies dangerous to others and themselves.The film is broken into three segments, all directed by different people but all tied together with the same characters and focused mainly around the main couple, two folks that are a meeting-and-cheating couple (so right away you aren't cheering for them to live).Within the first segment we get a true classic horror film, similar to the intense moments one would see from such legends as Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, George Romero, and Wes Craven.  The sudden shocks of people slowly snapping mentally after being exposed to the signal was simply brilliant.  And the mayhem that follows is some of the best suspense moments never mind horror moments in recent memory.  This piece of the film is truly a throwback of the grainy, melancholic, and agitating classics of heyday; basically the type of film Rob Zombie would love to make.Skipping to the third segment, this again brings back the great heyday of classic horror.  This segment does not match up with the first mostly due to the screenwriting, but it is worthy of mentioning as being ""well done"" horror.  Since it ties up the story somewhat, the screenwriting focuses more on this rather than allowing the director the dynamic approach and story flow of the first segment.The second segment is the problem.  Okay, first I'd like to say this was well done all around.  The acting was absolutely great, the direction was splendid, and what it was trying to do (horror-comedy) worked.  But with all this, suddenly the whole tone of the film changed!  The problem is that it just doesn't fit into the bookend segments.  And it drags on much too much especially after the kinetic first segment which though no shorter, flew by with its intensity.So, here is a film that generally is well done, but the ""experiment"" of three different directors doing three different segments turns a film with potential into a mixed bag.  Totally unfortunate.  The screenplay seems to have been written for this in mind rather than to produce a flowing, intense, horror film.For the DVD, all the extras are excellent and are all worth viewing and listening to.",3,An experiment by 3 directors goes wrong.,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,2991,"['Well', 'here', 'well', 'hyped', 'film', 'out', 'promising', 'actually', 'pretty', 'well', 'yet', 'fails', 'miserably', 'middle', 'reasons', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'Unfortunately', 'result', 'middle', ""n't"", 'fit', 'rest', 'film', 'causing', 'flick', 'be', 'nice', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'failure.The', 'film', 'take', 'zombie', 'genre', 'very', 'original', 'spin', ""'re"", 'Stephen', 'King', 'Rather', 'having', 'folks', 'being', 'infected', 'virus', 'folks', 'have', 'risen', 'dead', 'have', 'signal', 'similar', 'white', 'noise', 'one', 'night', 'television', 'turning', 'folks', 'crazies', 'disturbed', 'simply', 'brain', 'dead', 'think', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'Cell', 'television', 'rather', 'cellphone', 'folks', 'turn', 'harmless', 'nuts', 'great', 'many', 'become', 'violent', 'murderers', 'hallucinatory', 'crazies', 'dangerous', 'others', 'themselves.The', 'film', 'broken', 'three', 'segments', 'directed', 'different', 'people', 'tied', 'together', 'same', 'characters', 'focused', 'mainly', 'main', 'couple', 'two', 'folks', 'are', 'meeting-and-cheating', 'couple', 'so', 'right', 'away', 'are', ""n't"", 'cheering', 'live', 'first', 'segment', 'get', 'true', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', 'similar', 'intense', 'moments', 'one', 'would', 'see', 'such', 'legends', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'George', 'Romero', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'sudden', 'shocks', 'people', 'slowly', 'snapping', 'mentally', 'being', 'exposed', 'signal', 'was', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'mayhem', 'best', 'suspense', 'moments', 'never', 'mind', 'horror', 'moments', 'recent', 'memory', 'piece', 'film', 'truly', 'throwback', 'grainy', 'melancholic', 'agitating', 'classics', 'heyday', 'basically', 'type', 'film', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'would', 'love', 'make.Skipping', 'third', 'segment', 'again', 'back', 'great', 'heyday', 'classic', 'horror', 'segment', 'not', 'match', 'up', 'first', 'mostly', 'due', 'screenwriting', 'worthy', 'mentioning', 'being', 'well', 'done', 'horror', 'up', 'story', 'somewhat', 'screenwriting', 'more', 'rather', 'allowing', 'director', 'dynamic', 'approach', 'story', 'flow', 'first', 'segment.The', 'second', 'segment', 'problem', 'Okay', 'first', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'around', 'acting', 'was', 'absolutely', 'great', 'direction', 'was', 'splendid', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'horror-comedy', 'worked', 'suddenly', 'whole', 'tone', 'film', 'changed', 'problem', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'bookend', 'segments', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'especially', 'kinetic', 'first', 'segment', 'shorter', 'flew', 'intensity.So', 'here', 'film', 'generally', 'well', 'done', 'experiment', 'three', 'different', 'directors', 'doing', 'three', 'different', 'segments', 'film', 'potential', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Totally', 'unfortunate', 'screenplay', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'mind', 'rather', 'produce', 'flowing', 'intense', 'horror', 'film.For', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'worth', 'viewing', 'listening']",N/A

The first segment is violent and disturbing without much humor, followed by a second act which becomes broadly (although darkly) comic and then shifts sharply back to disturbing and violent, and the tone of the third segment is back to more or less straight horror/apocalypse.I thought the uncertainty about who is affected by the Signal and who is not, and the fact that different characters are affected to different degrees, was a very interesting direction and adds a lot of paranoia to an already paranoid situation.Overall, this had a fresh and creative feel, and was well worth watching.  Do watch the extra vignettes that were shot for the DVD, portraying some scenes that occur at other locations in Terminus, not involving the characters of the main film.

1152246,A3E8Y4OW8IFFDX,B001662FKK,S. P. Miskowski,"[8, 11]","Directed by David Bruckner, Dan Bush, and Jacob GentryThe Signal received a fair number of critical accolades before its theatrical release. But if there is one thing I've learned about highly touted horror flicks, it is to keep an open mind no matter what other people say. The genre has many sub-categories, and some fans don't cross over. One fan's delight is another's five dollar trade-in value.This technically expert study of mass violence is divided into a three-part structure with a different writer for each segment or transmission:Trans 1.0Crazy Lovewritten by David BrucknerA married woman says good night to her lover and leaves him distractedly watching TV, while a signal keeps jamming the picture, reducing it to a flashing kaleidoscope. The woman returns home to her suspicious, TV-viewing husband, who is involved in an argument that will soon escalate.Trans 2.0The Jealousy Monsterwritten by Jacob GentryThe characters from the first segment intersect with their neighbors down the street. The neighbors have been preparing a New Year's Eve party, unaware that violence has erupted outside. Some characters realize what is happening, and others are in denial.Trans 3.0written by Dan BushEscape from TerminusCharacters from both previous segments try to outwit one another--and separate reality from their delusions--long enough to make their way out of town.In theoretical terms, the structure is interesting. New and strange twists of fate might occur with different artists creating portions of the narrative. But forty-five minutes in, horror lapses uneasily into farce, in Trans 2.0, and leaves the blood-stained surviving characters washed up in a mundane setting.After fumbling through a bunch of brutal, domestic misunderstandings, all is well. That is, we finally get back to the action. But the film never regains its original momentum.In the absence of that momentum, I fall back on petty gripes:Gripe 1.1The heroine is slow-acting to the point of being catatonic. OK, she's traumatized. But more internal stress, and more external movement, would have been more fun to watch. To be fair, none of the characters act quickly on instinct. They seem anesthetized by shock, which (again) is a better idea in theory than practice.Gripe 2.1The description on the DVD cover and online says that a mysterious transmission is invading every cell phone, radio, and TV. But in the main story line we only see it transmitted via TV.Gripe 3.1A lot of the people who receive the signal do not become violent and we never learn why some people do and some do not.Gripe 3.1aTo understand the effect of the signal, we need one example, but the film offers one after another, without adding anything each time. The characters hallucinate, but their visions seem limited by their lack of imagination. Good idea, not that compelling to watch.SPOILER WARNINGGripe 3.1bAllowing for the real possibility that I'm just too stupid to get the whole thing, I don't see any reason to have an imagined, false ending if you're not going to change it the second time around. What if Brazil came back to the starting point for the last scene again, and then offered no indication that the story would go in a different direction? It made me wonder, but not for long. When the film was over, I had finished thinking about it.The Signal is pretty evenly divided among several characters. Each section has its humorous and engaging moments, but over-all the story suffers from the lack of a central protagonist. It wavers between social satire and love story, and never reveals enough about any one character to make their survival matter.The DVD offers deleted scenes as well as extra transmissions, which are complete sequences taking place in other parts of the city while the main action occurs. If you want to view the story as an active landscape in which many dramas happen simultaneously, the extra transmissions add depth and complexity to the picture. But if you want to identify with someone, and if you're looking for dramatic tension in the narrative, the extras won't help.",3,Too Clever For Its Own Good,1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,4082,"['Directed', 'David', 'Bruckner', 'Dan', 'Bush', 'Jacob', 'GentryThe', 'Signal', 'received', 'fair', 'number', 'critical', 'accolades', 'theatrical', 'release', 'one', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'highly', 'touted', 'horror', 'flicks', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'matter', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'say', 'genre', 'many', 'sub-categories', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'cross', 'One', 'fan', 'delight', 'five', 'dollar', 'trade-in', 'value.This', 'technically', 'expert', 'study', 'mass', 'violence', 'divided', 'three-part', 'structure', 'different', 'writer', 'segment', 'transmission', '1.0Crazy', 'Lovewritten', 'David', 'BrucknerA', 'married', 'woman', 'good', 'night', 'lover', 'distractedly', 'watching', 'TV', 'signal', 'keeps', 'jamming', 'picture', 'reducing', 'flashing', 'kaleidoscope', 'woman', 'home', 'suspicious', 'TV-viewing', 'husband', 'who', 'involved', 'argument', 'will', 'soon', 'escalate.Trans', '2.0The', 'Jealousy', 'Monsterwritten', 'Jacob', 'GentryThe', 'characters', 'first', 'segment', 'intersect', 'neighbors', 'down', 'street', 'neighbors', 'have', 'been', 'preparing', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'party', 'unaware', 'violence', 'erupted', 'characters', 'realize', 'what', 'happening', 'others', 'are', 'denial.Trans', '3.0written', 'Dan', 'BushEscape', 'TerminusCharacters', 'previous', 'segments', 'try', 'outwit', 'one', 'separate', 'reality', 'delusions', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'way', 'town.In', 'theoretical', 'terms', 'structure', 'interesting', 'New', 'strange', 'twists', 'fate', 'might', 'occur', 'different', 'artists', 'creating', 'portions', 'narrative', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'horror', 'lapses', 'uneasily', 'farce', 'Trans', '2.0', 'blood-stained', 'surviving', 'characters', 'washed', 'up', 'mundane', 'setting.After', 'fumbling', 'bunch', 'brutal', 'domestic', 'misunderstandings', 'well', 'finally', 'get', 'back', 'action', 'film', 'never', 'original', 'momentum.In', 'absence', 'momentum', 'fall', 'back', 'petty', 'gripes', 'Gripe', '1.1The', 'heroine', 'slow-acting', 'point', 'being', 'catatonic', 'OK', 'traumatized', 'more', 'internal', 'stress', 'more', 'external', 'movement', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'be', 'fair', 'none', 'characters', 'act', 'quickly', 'instinct', 'seem', 'anesthetized', 'shock', 'again', 'better', 'idea', 'theory', 'practice.Gripe', '2.1The', 'description', 'DVD', 'cover', 'online', 'mysterious', 'transmission', 'invading', 'cell', 'phone', 'radio', 'TV', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'only', 'see', 'transmitted', 'TV.Gripe', '3.1A', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'receive', 'signal', 'do', 'not', 'become', 'violent', 'never', 'learn', 'why', 'people', 'do', 'do', 'not.Gripe', '3.1aTo', 'understand', 'effect', 'signal', 'need', 'one', 'example', 'film', 'one', 'adding', 'anything', 'time', 'characters', 'hallucinate', 'visions', 'seem', 'limited', 'lack', 'imagination', 'Good', 'idea', 'not', 'compelling', 'watch.SPOILER', 'WARNINGGripe', '3.1bAllowing', 'real', 'possibility', ""'m"", 'just', 'too', 'stupid', 'get', 'whole', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'have', 'imagined', 'false', 'ending', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'change', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'What', 'Brazil', 'came', 'back', 'starting', 'point', 'last', 'scene', 'again', 'then', 'offered', 'indication', 'story', 'would', 'go', 'different', 'direction', 'made', 'wonder', 'not', 'long', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'had', 'finished', 'thinking', 'it.The', 'Signal', 'pretty', 'evenly', 'divided', 'several', 'characters', 'section', 'humorous', 'engaging', 'moments', 'story', 'suffers', 'lack', 'central', 'protagonist', 'social', 'satire', 'love', 'story', 'never', 'reveals', 'enough', 'one', 'character', 'make', 'survival', 'matter.The', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'extra', 'transmissions', 'are', 'complete', 'sequences', 'taking', 'place', 'other', 'parts', 'city', 'main', 'action', 'want', 'view', 'story', 'active', 'landscape', 'many', 'dramas', 'happen', 'simultaneously', 'extra', 'transmissions', 'add', 'depth', 'complexity', 'picture', 'want', 'identify', 'someone', ""'re"", 'looking', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'narrative', 'extras', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help']",N/A
1152247,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B001662FKK,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[6, 9]","The movie begins with a low budget grindhouse schlock title sequence that's daring you to take it seriously. Three directors. Three parts and the whole movie is going to be a low budget horror movie. Strap yourself in and prepare for some mindless bloodbathing.And for the first third, that's pretty much what you get. You start out with a woman who's leaving her boyfriend to go back home to her husband. The television set is giving out static. The phones don't work. People around her began acting erratically but a lot of it is background (just like withThe Children of Mena lot of the story is taking place around the characters) and she gets home to find her husband and his friends arguing. The argument turns violent.At this point you've pretty much have accepted the genre tropes of the Post-Romero zombie movies. Be it28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition),Cell: A NovelorSerenity (Collector's Edition)something (besides the magical reanimation of dead tissue) is turning everyone into a pack of rabid animals only out to destroy (and if you're wondering why this particular genre is so popular, direct your attention toSafe Area Gorazde: The War in Eastern Bosnia 1992-1995to see what happens when human beings that have no excuse to turn into genocidal lunatics turn into genocidal lunatics. Ok, they have an excuse - something along the lines of ""we have to protect ourselves and you're going to do it first"" which sounds even more ridiculous than ""bottled rage"" or ""evil cell phones"").It's only at the end of the first third that the movie begins to take on its own perspective. The people affected by the signal don't know that they are being affected. Everyone else around them is affected; that's for sure. They are only acting in their best interest and they assume all of their neighbors are irrational. The movie works best when it's telling the story from the perspective of those affected. And since the signal affects everyone differently (and some can discipline themselves into tuning out the signal or at least ignoring it) it brings up a whole lot of issues about free will, conformity, rational vs. irrational and what you would do to survive and how much of your survival techniques are going to backfire.And it grounds it all in the characters - especially of a woman trying to escape a loveless marriage and the interplay between her lover and her husband. There are other things to praise in the movie including the use of actors that look like real people (I love to go to the movies and see pretty people all over the place too, but it's nice when the people are not ALL gods and goddesses) and a sequence of gallow's humor with a New Year's Eve guest that's completely oblivious to the apocalypse going on around him.However, the part that stays with me is the slight variation on the post-Romero zombie trope in that the signal is NOT all powerful and you can resist it and what does that mean to be a human being. When I was younger I read a review ofUHFthat said ""given the choice between a dumb movie that knows it's stupid and a smart movie that knows it's smart, I'll go with the dumb one every time."" Of course, a comment on that statement is the fact that there's nothing worse than a dumb movie that thinks it's smart (Peter Greenway comes to mind). And I have an affection for smart movies that don't act smart. And that describes this movie par excellance. As I mentioned at the beginning, this movie tries to play itself off as a dopey splatterpunk or grindhouse movie. Instead it becomes one of the most thought provoking movies I've seen in a long time.",5,"A scary, disturbing and ultimately beautiful horror movie",1211414400,"05 22, 2008",2008,3598,"['movie', 'low', 'budget', 'grindhouse', 'schlock', 'title', 'sequence', 'daring', 'take', 'seriously', 'Three', 'directors', 'Three', 'parts', 'whole', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'movie', 'Strap', 'prepare', 'mindless', 'bloodbathing.And', 'first', 'third', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'get', 'start', 'out', 'woman', 'who', 'leaving', 'boyfriend', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'husband', 'television', 'set', 'giving', 'out', 'static', 'phones', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'People', 'began', 'acting', 'erratically', 'lot', 'background', 'just', 'withThe', 'Children', 'Mena', 'lot', 'story', 'taking', 'place', 'characters', 'home', 'find', 'husband', 'friends', 'arguing', 'argument', 'violent.At', 'point', ""'ve"", 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'accepted', 'genre', 'tropes', 'Post-Romero', 'zombie', 'movies', 'Be', 'it28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Cell', 'NovelorSerenity', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'something', 'magical', 'reanimation', 'dead', 'tissue', 'turning', 'everyone', 'pack', 'rabid', 'animals', 'only', 'destroy', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'why', 'particular', 'genre', 'so', 'popular', 'direct', 'attention', 'toSafe', 'Area', 'Gorazde', 'War', 'Eastern', 'Bosnia', '1992-1995to', 'see', 'what', 'when', 'human', 'beings', 'have', 'excuse', 'turn', 'genocidal', 'lunatics', 'turn', 'genocidal', 'lunatics', 'Ok', 'have', 'excuse', 'something', 'lines', 'have', 'protect', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'first', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'bottled', 'rage', 'evil', 'cell', 'phones', '.It', 'only', 'end', 'first', 'third', 'movie', 'take', 'own', 'perspective', 'people', 'affected', 'signal', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'being', 'affected', 'Everyone', 'else', 'affected', 'sure', 'are', 'only', 'acting', 'best', 'interest', 'assume', 'neighbors', 'are', 'irrational', 'movie', 'best', 'when', 'telling', 'story', 'perspective', 'affected', 'signal', 'affects', 'everyone', 'differently', 'can', 'discipline', 'tuning', 'out', 'signal', 'least', 'ignoring', 'up', 'whole', 'lot', 'issues', 'free', 'will', 'conformity', 'rational', 'vs.', 'irrational', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'survive', 'how', 'much', 'survival', 'techniques', 'are', 'going', 'backfire.And', 'characters', 'especially', 'woman', 'trying', 'escape', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'interplay', 'lover', 'husband', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'praise', 'movie', 'including', 'use', 'actors', 'look', 'real', 'people', 'love', 'go', 'movies', 'see', 'pretty', 'people', 'place', 'too', 'nice', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'ALL', 'gods', 'goddesses', 'sequence', 'gallow', 'humor', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'guest', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'apocalypse', 'going', 'him.However', 'part', 'slight', 'variation', 'post-Romero', 'zombie', 'trope', 'signal', 'NOT', 'powerful', 'can', 'resist', 'what', 'mean', 'be', 'human', 'being', 'When', 'was', 'younger', 'read', 'review', 'ofUHFthat', 'said', 'given', 'choice', 'dumb', 'movie', 'stupid', 'smart', 'movie', 'smart', ""'ll"", 'go', 'dumb', 'one', 'time', 'course', 'comment', 'statement', 'fact', 'nothing', 'worse', 'dumb', 'movie', 'smart', 'Peter', 'Greenway', 'mind', 'have', 'affection', 'smart', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'smart', 'movie', 'par', 'excellance', 'mentioned', 'beginning', 'movie', 'play', 'off', 'dopey', 'splatterpunk', 'grindhouse', 'movie', 'Instead', 'one', 'most', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time']",N/A

1152251,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001662FKK,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[2, 4]","Independent horror films have always held a certain charm to me. I like horror films that have no multi-million dollar Studio behind it. Because in independent films, the creative team usually have all the creative control. THE SIGNAL (2007) is a nice piece of an independent horror film, it sets out exactly what it means to do and it brought out strong performances from its cast. This film is a collaboration between three directors and writers: David Bruckner, Dan Bush and Jacob Gentry, and yes, these three even made some minor cameo appearances. (as screaming men)Synopsis partly derived from the dvd back cover:It's New year's eve in the city of Terminus (The name of the city itself is quite foreboding) and chaos is this year's resolution. All forms of communication, phones, television and radio have been jammed by a mysterious transmission that preys on fear and desire, paranoia and delusion, that drives the city's population to wanton acts of murder and madness. The collapse of civilization is at hand...The film is divided into three acts or as the film calls them ""transmissions"". Act one is directed by David Bruckner and explores Mya's situation (Anessa Ramsey) The beginning credits looks like an ode to older B-movies and very reminiscent to a 70's horror film. Then you see the ""signal"".Transmission One: Mya is cheating on her husband with Ben (Justin Welborn) and while her relationship with her husband Lewis (AJ Bowen) is left to the viewer as being a rocky one, it all serves as a set up for the film's violence. It's a slow build up but very effective. It was quite unnerving to see normal people just suddenly go berserk and the saner ones are caught in all the madness. Just who are the homicidal maniacs and which ones are only defending themselves?Transmission Two is directed by Jacob Gentry and goes into a very different tone. The second act may seem a little silly because of its satirical undertones but works well enough to give the ""madness"" some needed (ahem) character development. The supporting characters are introduced and Clark (Scott Poythress) has his own theories as to what the signal is. There are several accusing fingers pointed at the media's theorized ""subliminal"" messages.Transmission three is the film's final resolution and is directed by (you guessed it) Dan Bush. Hallucinations, lost of mental control take center stage as Clark and Ben tries to find Mya and escape the city, with Lewis hot on their trail .The film has a lot of personality and does serve up an abundance of brutal violence, blood and some GORE. The film does have its fair share of unnerving intensity and claustrophobia. The well-staged bits of mayhem and chaos succeed in delivering exactly what a true ""independent"" horror film that somehow feels like a homage to John Carpenter's chaotic films in the 80`s. At first, I was afraid that it would merely focus on a forbidden love and serve up some doses of guilt; but the character introductions became quite impressive although I have to admit that the satire in the 2nd act did give me mixed feelings about the film, however small they were. The satire seems a little out of place and opened some minor plot holes, but I learned to appreciate its VERY dark sense of humor.AJ Bowen's character, Lewis is actually the main antagonist in a way aside from the situation itself. His mind is so warped that he is doing the right thing that he actually thought that he is protecting himself and those around him. His character seemed a lot more interesting and maybe a little more compelling than Mya or Ben. In a way he is the victim of the affair, and however horrendous his actions may be, he ends up a little pitiable and empathetic.Now the film does have its share its flaws but it is also part of its charm. The third act seemed a bit too overly dramatic as to how the escape could be achieved and I did feel that the script began to run out of forward momentum. I am not sure whether each ""transmission"" was made in conjunction with the other or if each act was shot independently but the direction did seem to lose a little restraint and some scenes turned up a little cheap and heavy-handed.In closing, I do feel that THE SIGNAL is successful bit of independent cinema. The film does serve up a true cinematic experience on a shoestring budget. The strong performances by its cast takes most of its burden and its wit is clever enough for me to overlook its shortcomings. The film is a lot of fun to watch and the atmosphere is foreboding enough to give you some chills and shock value. Unnervingly suspenseful but sometimes a bit silly--it has the makings of a ""cult"" classic.Recommended!
