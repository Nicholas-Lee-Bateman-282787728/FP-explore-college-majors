I ordered this item as a Christmas gift. I received it in a brown box with a shipping label.  When the box was turned over, there was a peek-a-boo hole in the box approiximately  2.5"" x 3.5"" exposing the invoice.  The order number, content information and price were ALL visible through the hole. If you are concerned about privacy or if you are buying this as a gift and wish to keep the contents secret from another household member, you may want to purchase this item elsewhere or make plans to be the only one picking up the mail until after it arrives. I have purchased MANY things from Amazon and this is the first time I have received anything in this type of box. I hope it will be the last.Update 9/2007:  I have ordered a number of other DVD sets from Amazon and they have NOT shipped them in the packaging I described above.I have also had an opportunity to view some of the episodes in this DVD set. While the quality of this DVD is fine, I guess my reaction to the content was different than when I originally viewed this show on television. Mrs. Hart's character isn't nearly as smart, independent or liberated as I remembered her to be.If I were selecting a DVD set of a television detective couple as a gift again, I would choose the REMINGTON STEELE DVD set over this one.",5,BEWARE!!!!!!

932933,A5LR598LRGPJ2,B000ASDFIG,"Barry Iddon ""MR. PAPARAZZI . THE STAR TREKKER .""","[4, 8]","A Heart to Hart, in a Texas Town..I  first met R. J. Wagner in the early 1970 period, when he and hisfirst wife movie Star actress Natalie Wood were working at the Manchester based Granada T.V. studios.They were engaged in the making of  a filmed version of the successful  Tennessee Williams play: Cat on a Hot Tin Roof .Also supporting them, were an all star cast of British stage actors; which include legendary Laurence Olivier.I  intercepted Mr & Mrs Wagner as they left the studios, early one evening, as they were subsequently walking back up to the Midland Hotel a five minute journey on foot.They were very well mannered people as I approached them courteously endeavouring to introduce myself. And requesting from them if I may have their autographs, which they both did quite delightedly.We exchanged a few words, and went our separate ways, mine being to return home to Liverpool, with a feeling of accomplishment after having just met two Hollywood Stars.Many years later ! The summer of 1982.  I was pleasantly surprised to again meet Robert Wagner.This time it was while I was visiting the Warner Brothers studios which are based in Burbank a suburb of Los Angeles. I was visiting America, on a charity mission, compiling a series of star interviews and pictures, which would be auctioned off, at a later date as funds raising materialsThrough one of my many contacts, I had managed to obtain a studio V.I.P. day visitors pass, which would enable me to see aspects of what was currently in production on the Warner Brothers studios sound stages.One was ""Fantasy Island"" and the other was ""Hart to Hart"". Two of televisions, most popular weekly series , with a worldwide audience.The office that I reported to was combined with the sound stage building and a P.R. lady was assigned to show me around the sets.As we passed one of the vehicles I momentarily glanced at the name display, which read ""Ricardo Montalban"" I turned instantly to my companion escort and inquisitively said to here! Is Mr Montalban available for a chat ?Wait her a moment Mr Iddon I'll make enquiriesa couple of minutes passed, and she returned smiling ! Your in luck, he has some free time, please follow me !We entered into his mobile home and I was introduced to him, minutes later we were into constructive conversation about the show, ""Fantasy Island""I enjoy the character you portray I told him referring to `Mister Roark' the suave, slightly mysterious, owner of this tropical paradise island, the show is very exciting each week; and I enjoy the special guests stars that your show has each seeking your special qualities, to help fulfil their fantasy, its a fabulous premise.He was very impressed by my comments, and asked if I would like a few autographed 10 x 8 stills as a souvenir of my visit with him !I would appreciate that most sincerely I replied! as he reached over to a convenient work top, and selected a bunch of photographs.After signing the materials for me, we took our leave from his company with a friendly hand-shake, and he exclaimed that it was a pleasure for him ! to have met such a gentle-Gentleman and he wished me well on your travels.I have never forgotten his kind word to me.Outside the vehicle  my guide suggested that our next destination before lunch should be the ""Hart to Hart"" set so off we both went: after I had one of my fantasy's  fulfilled .Meeting Ricardo Montalban .We both weaved our way past rows of trailers and studio prop's of every description until we reached another sound stage building,Again the same  routine was played out as earlier ! please follow me, and watch your step.I soon found myself on the kitchen set, of the Hart household ! and presently confronted by ""Stefanie Powers"" who plays Jennifer Hart and Lionel Stander who plays their chauffeur / confidant `Max' but no sign of  Robert Wagner  (aka)  Jonathon Hart.Hello who this enquired Stefanie ? to Laura my guide.This is Mr Iddon, from England, Miss Powers ! he is visiting the set,I understand it was all organized from the Aaron Spelling offices : Oh well I guess that's alright then come on in and take a seat, while the next shots are being set up.Several technicians were sorting out props while a camera man was repositioning his equipment, as we all exchanged conversational words, before we were interrupted by an assistant who informed Stefanie that they were ready for here next shot :She excused herself and regained her character, then it was : quiet action  ""Roll Em"" take two.Then it was the lunch call as every thing came to a halt. Stefanie re-joined me after the scene was shot, accompanied by Robert Wagner and after being introduced we conversed about the show; and how it was being received on the British T.V.In passing I felt that I should mention to Wagner that we had met many years before at the Granada T.V. studios Manchester; our meeting was very brief I told him; but I assured him that it was memorable for me.He smiled politely and thanked me for jogging his memory.I asked finally if I may take a few photographs as a memento of my visit with them ,which they agreed to do for me; then all to soon, my day at ""Warner Brother"" with a life time of my favourite STARS was over but not erased from my memories.My story continues fourteen years later; I had laid planes to visit another part of America on a sight seeing expedition a change from my annual trips to the entertainment's capitols Hollywood and Las Vegas. which I had done for a period spanning 23 years!Its summer 1996. and I have my sights set on the state of Texas: its time for a complete change of scene for me I thought to myself, as I boarded the British Airways flight to HoustonTexas.I had a few pre-conceived ideas of what this trip was going to be for me a strictly No movie Star venture : I was just going to ride the range sight seeing: not horseback only horsepower, which would be provided by Alamo car rental.A driving adventure plus some lazing about on some sun kissed beaches! Were ever my workhorse took me this was to be my itinerary for the next three weeks.I arrived into Houston 3.30.p.m. local time and I picked up my ""Alamo rental car"" which I had (Pre booked) less than a week ago; when I was struck by a sudden fanciful idea to see this state.And after checking over my Dodge Dynasty sedan, getting acquainted with the control systems etc, I drove of there parking area: and headed West onto the Interstate 10. destination  San Antonio distances 142 miles: a comfortable three hours drive.I arrived at the Holiday Inn, Riverwalk location at 7.00p.m.and proceeded to get checked in, then I organised a light meal in the restaurant, before getting my head down on the pillow, a routine that I have always set myself, on my world trips.Get into bed early on your first night, it elevates Jet Lag.Next morning after breakfast: its hit the streets time for the exploratory tour of the immediate surroundings; leaving my car behind on the hotel forecourt, its 10.30.a.m. beautiful sunshine; and the temps in the high 80 degrees.I decided to do the full tourist thing! Visiting all the places of interest, which included a day at the Hemis-Fairs Tower of the Americas and visiting the Fairs Plaza and the elevator to the observation lookout deck to get the panoramic view of the city.I strolled along always armed with a camera on the banks of the Paseo Del Rio river which run through the centre of the city, and the most noticeable tourist point, is the ""Alamo National Monument""This attracts thousands of visitors, its a solemn vigil touring around fortress, and photographing artefacts is not allowed; but to an old film buff such as myself it conjures up memories of  John Wayne and Richard Widmark supported by a distinguished cast of long gone supporting cowboy actors in the Hollywood epic film ""The Alamo"" which was made back in 1960  but Hey !This is supposed to be a Hollywood free vacation or so I thought at the time.The following week my trusty horse a General Motors model had transported me around many trails into the high country and up to the state capital.""Austin ""was a huge city: then down to the Mexican border town of Laredo and finally into the gulf coast city of ""Corpus Christi"" south of San Antonio.It was here that I planned to laze around on the beaches of Padre Island and soak up some sunshine.Looking through the local evening paper: I spotted an item, which momentarily put my mind into orbit.My interests were aroused when I read that Robert Wagner and Jill St John. (his Wife) now, after Natalie Woods, tragic death years earlier, where to appear  on stage for on night only, at ""The Shrine Auditorium"" theatre Corpus Christi, in a touring play entitled  `Love Letters' in three days time.My first thoughts were I must pay him a courteous visit after all I have known him for 26 years, he is sure to remember me!Sunday soon came round and my plan was the old tried and well tested strategy, get to the theatre early in the afternoon, establish contact with tour management, show creditational identification and request an interview: once this is in order you just hope that theywill do the business for you; sometime that evening when they arrive.Having checked out the evening performance starting time, and made myself recognisable to theatre personnel backstage; I left and returned at 6.30.The show was scheduled to commence 7.45.I mingled in the rear entrance, were the artists would eventually make their arrival and it wasn't to long before the two stars preceded by their P.A. representative walked in through the door.They had been informed that I was here; so R.J. came straight over to me; ""Hello how are ya"" what are you doing in Texas?  its been quite a while since we've seen each other?Can I introduce my wife Jill said  Robert ?You know honey I have seen this man so many times it covers a lot of years: what it is that we can do for You he asked politlyIntroductions over! and where now in a sumptuous on suite dressing room; talking about my Texas adventures like two old buddies, ""Chew'in the Grits"" and on reflection it seemed that they were enjoying my travellers tale, both of them displaying enormous interest in what I had to say.They even intimated that they would love to do something like this them selves : this statement crept into the conversation, especially when I talked about visiting the old pioneering spots dotted around the high country, and the Panhandle Trails!A real change from the fast lane life style of Beverly Hills, we could have no doubt talked all night but it was soon curtain up; for them and a waiting game for me until the half way interval.I secured a seat in the theatre almost on the stage but my vision was not impaired from the angle as I watched  the two Stars performed  their piece;  sitting opposite each other at writing desks reminiscing about the exchange of  `Love Letter' that they each sent to one another over a life time period.As the first act closed: I exited to the back stage area again, as I had been invited to join them for some refreshments in the Green Room.Hi Barry I was greeted come on in did you enjoy our piece so far?Of cause was my reply; had to be wonderful.What would you like to drink, Jill asked me?  A Coke will do, just fine:I put it to them, now that they were in a relaxed mood, could I take some photographs, suggesting that while they were in formal evening dress it would make a nice picture opportunity for me, they responded without hesitation, I took several formal shots, and then courteously requested if they would allow me to do some while displaying several ""Variety Club Brochures"" and Gold Hearts.Again this was done; most enjoyably by them both showing a great interest in my efforts to endorse this charity, that I campaigned for.The significance that this is a worldwide children's charity made them more enthusiastic about the project which I endeavoured to promote every were I went and it showed in their faces as they posed for me!By now it was second act time so I made my way back to my seat, and they returned onto the stage. The format as earlier was unchanged, however! when they took their bow's of appreciation from Three Thousand patrons at the finally.Robert Wagner, came to the front of the stage, collected the hand microphone, and proceeded to introduce ""ME"" to his audience, telling them about my travels for Handicapped Children's `Sunshine Coaches' and pressing home the point, that it was an American backed event too. I was asked to join him on the stage: and to take a well earned Bow and a round of applause, much to my delight and appreciation.Later back stage I had a few souvenir pictures taken with R.J. to his friends; and his lovely wife Jill St John before we said our farewells until the next time we meet again ! but Who knows where or When ?",5,A HART TO HEART WITH ROBERT WAGNER IN A TEXAS

932937,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B000ASDFIG,Bobby Underwood,"[144, 150]","For five wonderful seasons, ""Hart to Hart"" was about the most fun you could have in an hour without getting into any trouble. Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers were simply perfect as the rich couple with nothing to do but solve murders. They were Jonathan and Jennifer Hart, living the fun life we all wished we had. The chemistry between Stefanie Powers and Robert Wagner was natural and you could always tell, especially with Wagner, that they were having a ball.Sidney Sheldon created the characters but it was really a stroke of genius to cast Wagner and Powers. Wagner took his cool Alexander Munday persona from ""It Takes a Thief"" and just made him richer and happier, with a lovely companion he got to keep. Stefanie Powers always had a certain something but had never really found the right part, until Hart to Hart. Jennifer Hart came so naturally that you couldn't help thinking she wasn't really acting at all. Come to think of it, the same could be said of Robert Wagner's seemingly effortless turn as Jonathan Hart.This was heaven for light mystery fans. There was always plenty of fun banter between Jonathan and ""Mrs. H"" and enough humorous situations mixed in with the latest week's adventure to keep everyone tickled pink. Not to be undervalued as the reason the show was such a big hit, was Lionel Stander's role as their butler, Max. Max was much more like family than hired help, and in the show's opening every week, you knew right away Max was an important part of the proceedings. After introducing the self-made millionaire, Jonathan, and his other boss, Mrs. H, Max always stated that he had trouble taking care of them, because their hobby was murder!Not to be forgotten, of course, was their lovable dog, Freeway, who sometimes forgot who was the owner and who was the pet. The first season had great guest stars like Markie Post, Juliet Mills and John Hillerman. The stories were frivilous fun, as this wasn't real danger, just TV danger, and we always new our favorite husband and wife would solve the mystery and uncork some champagne at the end.There were 22 episodes the first season, plus the pilot movie. Those episodes are: HIT JENNIFER HART - PASSPORT TO MURDER - JONATHAN HART JNR. - DEATH IN THE SLOW LANE - YOU MADE ME KILL YOU - MURDER BETWEEN FRIENDS - COP OUT - MAX IN LOVE - A NEW KIND OF HIGH - WITH THIS GUN, I THEE WED - MAN WITH JADE EYES - COLOR JENNIFER DEAD - A QUESTION OF INNOCENCE - NIGHT HORRORS - WHICH WAY FREEWAY? - DOWNHILL TO DEATH - RAID -SIXTH SENSE - DOES SHE, OR DOESN'T SHE? - CRUISE AT YOUR OWN RISK - TOO MANY COOKS ARE MURDER - DEATH SET""Hart to Hart"" was delightful escapist fare. Mark Snow's ""Hart to Hart"" theme at the opening of the show was light and breezy, and fans looked forward to hearing it every week. Snow would finally become famous for his moody theme for ""The X-Files.""The domestic and mystery adventures of the self-made man, Jonathan, and his ex-journalist wife, Jennifer, made for a charming and breezy hour of pleasure. The adventures of the spohisticated couple, who it turned out were just like us, only rich, was a great way to unwind at the end of a long day, and still is. Every TV mystery fan will want to pick this one up. So pop the cork from the champagne in the limo, call ahead to make sure the private jet is waiting, and jot off to TV land, where rich and attractive couples delight us by solving murders while living the life of leisure.

Dibert ""the wessel DVD Collector and ...","[1, 2]","This hit TV Series hit the airwaves on August 25 1979 starring Robert Wagner as Jonathan Hart, Stefanie Powers as Jennifer Hart and Lionel Stander as the butler Max. This was how the show started. This is my boss, Jonathan Hart - a self-made millionaire. He's quite a guy. This is Mrs. H. She's gorgeous. She's one lady who knows how to take care of herself. By the way, my name is Max. I take care of *both* of them, which isn't easy; 'cause when they met... it was *murder*! Jonathan Hart is self-made millionaire and the CEO of Hart Industries, which is a global conglomerate. Jonathan is married to the lovely Jennifer who's a freelance journalist. There hobby was private detective and found themselves in situation that resulted in murder, smuggling, theft, and or international espionage. Despite there dangerous hobby the two also found time to snuggle up to each other because they love each other very much. In the opening pilot that started this show on it's run has Jonathan pulling up to his company in his Royce. When Jonathan tries to enter Mr. Hart office the secretary won't let him in because she doesn't no who he is. When the secretary tries to stop Jonathan as he opens the door Markus introduces Jonathan to his secretary, the secretary has the look of embarrassment on her face as she shuts the door. Inside, Markus fills Jonathan in on what's happening with the business. When Jonathan leaves, he takes time to talk to his secretary who's only been with the company for six months. Therefore, Jonathan gets into his car and heads home to his mansion on the hill. When he gets there, he's greeted by his butler Max and his dog Freeway. Max became Jonathan Butler after Max help Jonathan get his business started. Max informs Jonathan that he received a telegram from his wife Jennifer who's in Paris France. Max mixes a drink for Jonathan who gives Freeway a lick of his finger and Freeway growls, which means he doesn't like it. So Max goes back and tries again and this time when Freeway gets a lick he barks which means it's good. Meanwhile a friend of Jonathans, Sam Roberts is driving away from a health farm called the Golden Goose Resort. When Sam is heading home his car goes over a cliff and burst into flames. While playing poker with his friends, Max and Freeway, Jonathan gets a call from Sam's wife, who tells Jonathan that Sam has been kill in a car accident. After talking to Sam's wife, Jonathan goes to see Sam's Doctor where he fines a brochure on the Golden Goose Resort so Jonathan sticks the brochure in his pocket. After getting no answers with Sam's doctor, Jonathan decides to head for the Golden Goose Resort to find out what happen to Sam himself. Jonathan starts down a mountain that has 12 miles of winding curves. On his way down Jonathan passes a yellow car along the side of the road that has no driver in it. After Jonathan passes the yellow car, a gorgeous red head gets up and pulls out. The two start racing down the mountainside while trying to pass each other. When the two come together, they must avoid a construction crews that have the road going down to one lane. The woman driver makes it through without any problems. However, Jonathan doesn't because he hits a police car which results in Jonathan getting several tickets. Down the road, the woman in the other car stops to make sure that Jonathan is all right before she pulls away. When Jonathan gets to the Golden Goose Resort the gorgeous red head is outside getting her car unloaded. Jonathans offers to her and goes to pickup her suitcase when it spills open sending her clothes to the ground. Jonathan meets up with the Red head at the counter and tries to apologize when his ink pen squirts ink on her blouse. Later in the evening, the lovely woman is sitting by herself in the dinning room when she sees Jonathan she gets up to leave. When the two meet in the doorway the gorgeous red head tells Jonathan she sorry and then smacks him across the face. Later that night the gorgeous red head is carrying a gun across the grounds and is climbing through the window of Jonathans Bungalow. Now a few thoughts on the show and the stars. I loved this show because for the most part, it was suspense full and it was very entertaining. I thought Robert Wagner was wonderful as Jonathan Hart. Lionel Stander was good as the butler and what can you say about Freeway. Now for Stefanie Powers! What can you say about a gorgeous red head that hasn't been said already.

Maybe it is a guilty pleasure, but sitting down to watch these old episodes is just as enjoyable now as it was back in the day - or maybe even better since DVD's offer the luxury of watching with NO COMMERCIAL interuptions !While the shows might seem a bit 'dated' at times by not being quite as graphic or intense as some shows today are,  thankfully those moments are few and far between, and it only goes to prove how far ahead of it's time Hart to Hart actually was. The settings and locations are beautiful, the clothes were top-of-the-line, and the lifestyle of this mega-million couple is still one to be envied.To take a husband and wife who were positively gorgeous, ridiculously wealthy and head over hearts in love with one another, and throw them into a shady murder investigation on a weekly basis sounds as if it would get stale pretty quickly, but somehow they made it work. Week after week Jonathan and Jennifer Hart would be called upon to help find the answers as friends and acquaintences -as well as more than a few perfect strangers, got bumped off in wierd and wacky ways.Stefanie Powers, Robert Wagner and Lionel Stander are just as enjoyable today as they were back then. The brief 'bonus' material that is present here, clearly shows that the stars were -and still are- genuinely fond of one another and enjoyed every minute of working together. I look forward to the remaining seasons of this classic show to be released on DVD.I wish there were more 'extras' like behind the scenes stuff or interviews that were done at the time, or outtakes with flubbed lines and missed cues. That kind of material always ends up being the stuff you watch the most anyway. Perhaps with the releases of the remaining seasons of Hart to Hart things like that will be added and expanded.

One of the only times a married couple is portrayed as romantic, interesting, sexy and glamorous.  No easy task, whether fiction or real.  It was done with panache in the ""Thin Man"" movies, which ""Hart to Hart"" draws from, but rarely has marriage been such a glorious black-tie occasion.  If you want messy hair and old bathrobes around the breakfast table, look elsewhere.  Jonathan (Robert Wagner) and Jennifer (Stefanie Powers) are a 1980's Nick and Nora Charles.  They drive each episode with their easy chemistry, double entendres and genuine likeability.The first season, 1979/1980, offers 22 episodes, one 2-hour pilot movie and a dvd extra that features Stefanie and Robert, along with creator Sidney Sheldon and creative consultant/director Tom Mankiewicz, talking about the series and showing a few clips & outtakes.In season one, the Harts, along with their quirky, loveable house man/chauffeur Max, uncover mysteries in Monaco, Mexico, Vail, on a cruise and often from their beautiful California home.  And they do it all while Jonathan runs Hart Industries and Jennifer manages a writing career, something she must do strictly for fun because clearly money doesn't escape them the way thieves and murderers try to.  Two of my favorite episodes in season one are:  ""Downhill to Death,"" where Jonathan & Jennifer uncover a murder plot in Vail while swooshing through sparkling, snowy scenery in cute outfits, and ""Which Way, Freeway?"" which offers up a murder mystery with the Hart's adorable dog, Freeway, at the heart of it...pun intended.For extra fun, look for guest spots and cameos from:  Natalie Wood, Eve Arden, Markie Post, Juliet Mills, Roddy McDowell and others.  For even more fun, take note of all of the chase scenes.  It's hilarious how many different modes of transportation they utilize.  Although, some could be identified as more of a slow-speed chase than high-speed.I highly recommend season one.

It's pure escapism and how can you not like Robert, Stephanie And Lionel. They had great chemistry together..It was also nice seeing the stunningly beautiful Nathalie Wood in a brief cameo in the pilot. She was married to Wagner at the time but sadly she would die from a boating accident less than 2 years later..The transfers look pretty good on my 48' big screen tv too!!All in all Sony did a really nice job witch this packing and I've had no freezing/glitch problems with any discsLet's hope we get seasons 2-5 released sooner rather than laterChow darlings :)",5,Great Show Darling!,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,655,"['terrific', 'show', 'Sure', 'plots', 'are', 'bit', 'far', 'fetched', 'whole', 'point', 'pure', 'escapism', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'Robert', 'Stephanie', 'Lionel', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together..It', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'seeing', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Nathalie', 'Wood', 'brief', 'cameo', 'pilot', 'was', 'married', 'Wagner', 'time', 'sadly', 'would', 'die', 'boating', 'accident', 'less', '2', 'years', 'later..The', 'transfers', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', '48', 'big', 'screen', 'tv', 'too', 'Sony', 'did', 'really', 'nice', 'job', 'witch', 'packing', ""'ve"", 'had', 'freezing/glitch', 'problems', 'discsLet', 'hope', 'get', 'seasons', '2-5', 'released', 'sooner', 'rather', 'laterChow', 'darlings']",N/A

Gibson ""70's tv addict!!!""","[9, 9]","First of all I must say I was very surprised that 3 of the largest retailers Best Buy, Target, and Circuit City did not carry this dvd set on the day of release, considering I wanted this long awaited dvd set in my hands on October 25th. Fortunately I was able to find the Hart to Hart dvd set at a much smaller retail chain at somewhat of a decent price, considering their prices are usually higher than the larger retail chains.I was so delighted with the packaging of this dvd set that I could'nt wait to watch all the episodes before giving another review! First of all the dvds come in individual cases with 2 in each case. To top it off there are 3 different pictures on the cases of Stefanie Powers and Robert Wagner that look dynamite!!! They really looked great together!!!The episodes are crisp with excellent sound quality, and I truly enjoyed seeing the show's opening theme!!! Wow! TV will never be this good again!!! Unfortunately today's tv shows consist of endless CSI style dramas, Law and Order clones, bad reality shows, etc. Don't get me wrong some of these shows are good but after watching so many similar clones it can be pretty depressing, and I don't watch tv to get depressed.
