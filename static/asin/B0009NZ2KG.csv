908775,A38N7SFDOB3MR3,B0009NZ2KG,,"[5, 5]","Because of Winn Dixie is the story of Opal, a young girl who has no friends, no mother, and a father who is living in a turtle shell. Opal stumbles upon a mutt in a Winn Dixie supermarket one day, and brings him home to her reluctant father.While on the surface, Because of Winn Dixie is the story of a girl and a dog, it is much deeper than that. Because of Winn Dixie is a story of how each of us make mistakes, and how each of us are lonely, and how one small event can change the lives of many.I found myself near tears many times in the film. I also burst out laughing many, many times. Like life, Because of Winn Dixie will have you laughing and crying at the same time. And in the end, you will feel uplifted, with hope, and a better person for seeing the film.I can't praise this film enough. Everything is perfect. The film is not just a family movie, but a great story for all ages. Whether you are 7, or 77, you will want to watch it again.The cast was perfect, and every actor did an amazing job. There wasn't a stray line or moment in the film. Because of Winn Dixie leaves you totally engrossed in the film, and totally immersed in the emotions of the story.This is as near perfect a film as can be made. See it. Buy it. Rent it. Enjoy it.

Cecily Tyson is the most memorable character in Winn-Dixie, and she is the one who ultimately unites the characters and teaches Opal important life lessons. If you view this movie less as a movie about a dog and a girl and more as a movie about lonely people with nothing in common but needing one another coming together, then you will experience several profound moments of humanity. Focus less on the goofy, irritating characters - primarily the sheriff- and more on the solid, real characters - Cecily Tyson as Gloria Dump, the woman considered to be a witch by the children in town with a heavy, burdensome past, Dave Matthews as Otis, the shy, reclusive man who also has had a rough life and now runs the pet store and charms the animals with his soft singing and guitar-playing.The cinematography is in many scenes mesmerizing.You will be glad that you took the time to overlook the superficiality and bask in the glow of a softly-lit scene of universal embrace.",4,There is beauty in this film!,1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,1084,"['movie', 'slow', 'places', 'need', 'additional', 'editing', 'beautiful', 'compelling', 'moments', 'Cecily', 'Tyson', 'most', 'memorable', 'character', 'Winn-Dixie', 'one', 'who', 'ultimately', 'characters', 'teaches', 'Opal', 'important', 'life', 'lessons', 'view', 'movie', 'movie', 'dog', 'girl', 'more', 'movie', 'lonely', 'people', 'nothing', 'common', 'needing', 'one', 'coming', 'together', 'then', 'will', 'experience', 'several', 'profound', 'moments', 'humanity', 'Focus', 'less', 'goofy', 'irritating', 'characters', 'primarily', 'sheriff-', 'more', 'solid', 'real', 'characters', 'Cecily', 'Tyson', 'Gloria', 'Dump', 'woman', 'considered', 'be', 'witch', 'children', 'town', 'heavy', 'burdensome', 'past', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'Otis', 'shy', 'reclusive', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'rough', 'life', 'now', 'pet', 'store', 'animals', 'soft', 'singing', 'guitar-playing.The', 'cinematography', 'many', 'scenes', 'mesmerizing.You', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'took', 'time', 'overlook', 'superficiality', 'bask', 'glow', 'softly-lit', 'scene', 'universal', 'embrace']",Because of Winn-Dixie

The dog trashes the supermarket, then the dog trashes the house-trailer where the girl and her father live, then the dog trashes the pet store, then the dog trashes the house-trailer a second time (in case you weren't watching the first time).  And these five-minute trash-bashes are separated by one mishap or spill after another.  It's enough to make David Swift himself jealous.  If you like seeing the same scene repeated four times, then this movie is for you.  To this half of the movie I give zero stars.The second half is much better: three stars.  I'd give it four but the developments that happen--the gradual making of friends and the rejuvenation of the town--are sketchily motivated if at all.  If the screenwriter had taken the time wasted in the first half and devoted it to a convincing development of the friendships, etc., this would have been a good movie.  As it is, there are some nice moments in the second half of the movie.I'd recommend starting at track 13 (to skip all the spills and slapstick) and watching from there on.

Long,"[0, 1]","I'll warn everyone upfront that this review is coming from a Christian perspective and is primarily directed at Christians that might want to purchase this:This is a fairly unique ""family friendly"" movie that generally produces praise from many that watch it. It is an entertaining, charming, ""feel good"" movie that is childlike without really being too childish. Most people will be able to identify with one or more of the people in this movie since most people have experienced loneliness or rejection at some point in their life. Kids (I'm thinking 8 and up) and adults alike can enjoy this movie.  The DVD has both widescreen and full-screen editions on the disc.  The Blu-ray, which I've also seen, is noticeably clearer and is the best way to watch this movie - I highly recommend the Blu-ray!As a Christian, I did have 1 pretty big issue with this movie, however. And it isn't with how they portrayed the preacher father (they showed him as a human being with faults like everyone else), although I do wish he had come across a little differently. My main concern with this movie has more to do with its central message: Basically the message of the movie is that we've all got issues/burdens in our lives and that the way to freedom is just to share those burdens with others and open our hearts to others. Basically a ""mutual exchange"" - you share your burdens with me, I share mine with you.While love is to be a trademark of Christianity and certainly part of loving people is to be real with people and ""love one another"" - and this does involve helping people in love to release their burdens, the problem with this movie is that they are never released to God, but rather people. The girl in the movie talks about a part of her that hurts so bad since she's missing her mama that feels like a ""hole"" in her of sorts, but the movie never showcases, discusses, or in any way insinuates that Jesus wants to help with that hurt and to fill those holes in her (or anyone else). This movie doesn't provide a message that God wants to help us in our loneliness or hurts - and that that, in fact, is part of what is available to us in Christ. Rather, the message is that we just need to love one another and share with one another. The object becomes humanity rather than God.For what this movie is: a realization that there are hurting people around us and we all need love and acceptance, and even unconditional love (as expressed in the movie by a dog), it is a pretty good movie. But that's pretty much as far as the movie will take you, and it actually insinuates that our need for love and acceptance can be adequately filled by people, as opposed to a realization that people are flawed and we need a love deeper than mere human love - we need to accept the love of our Creator that loves us with a perfect, everlasting love.I have heard that the book this is based on comes across more ""new agey"" than it is portrayed in the movie. That doesn't surprise me because a central theme of people with ""new age"" type beliefs is that humanity just needs to love people more to solve all its problems (as opposed to loving God more which then leads to loving people more - there's a difference).At the end of the day, I do believe this movie MIGHT be a decent movie to help ""jumpstart"" thought and discussion so it could potentially be a good ""family night"" type of movie, but I would say good follow-up discussion would be warranted - bringing out some of the things I discussed above and using this movie to springboard into talking about how Jesus wants to be our ""best friend"" - that as Christians we're never truly alone, etc.Chris LongMoviesForChristians Movie Reviewsmoviesforchristians dot org",4,Feel good movie but possibly concerning for Christians,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,3708,"[""'ll"", 'warn', 'everyone', 'upfront', 'review', 'coming', 'Christian', 'perspective', 'primarily', 'directed', 'Christians', 'might', 'want', 'purchase', 'fairly', 'unique', 'family', 'friendly', 'movie', 'generally', 'praise', 'many', 'watch', 'entertaining', 'charming', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'childlike', 'really', 'being', 'too', 'childish', 'Most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'one', 'more', 'people', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'experienced', 'loneliness', 'rejection', 'point', 'life', 'Kids', ""'m"", 'thinking', '8', 'up', 'adults', 'alike', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'full-screen', 'editions', 'disc', 'Blu-ray', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'noticeably', 'clearer', 'best', 'way', 'watch', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Blu-ray', 'Christian', 'did', 'have', '1', 'pretty', 'big', 'issue', 'movie', 'however', ""n't"", 'how', 'portrayed', 'preacher', 'father', 'showed', 'human', 'being', 'faults', 'everyone', 'else', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'come', 'little', 'differently', 'main', 'concern', 'movie', 'more', 'do', 'central', 'message', 'Basically', 'message', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'issues/burdens', 'lives', 'way', 'freedom', 'just', 'share', 'burdens', 'others', 'open', 'hearts', 'others', 'Basically', 'mutual', 'exchange', 'share', 'burdens', 'share', 'mine', 'you.While', 'love', 'be', 'trademark', 'Christianity', 'certainly', 'part', 'loving', 'people', 'be', 'real', 'people', 'love', 'one', 'involve', 'helping', 'people', 'love', 'release', 'burdens', 'problem', 'movie', 'are', 'never', 'released', 'God', 'rather', 'people', 'girl', 'movie', 'talks', 'part', 'so', 'bad', 'missing', 'mama', 'feels', 'hole', 'sorts', 'movie', 'never', 'discusses', 'way', 'Jesus', 'help', 'hurt', 'fill', 'holes', 'anyone', 'else', 'movie', ""n't"", 'provide', 'message', 'God', 'help', 'loneliness', 'fact', 'part', 'what', 'available', 'Christ', 'Rather', 'message', 'just', 'need', 'love', 'one', 'share', 'one', 'object', 'humanity', 'rather', 'God.For', 'what', 'movie', 'realization', 'are', 'hurting', 'people', 'need', 'love', 'acceptance', 'even', 'unconditional', 'love', 'expressed', 'movie', 'dog', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'far', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'actually', 'need', 'love', 'acceptance', 'can', 'be', 'adequately', 'filled', 'people', 'opposed', 'realization', 'people', 'are', 'flawed', 'need', 'love', 'deeper', 'mere', 'human', 'love', 'need', 'accept', 'love', 'Creator', 'perfect', 'everlasting', 'love.I', 'have', 'heard', 'book', 'based', 'more', 'new', 'agey', 'portrayed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'central', 'theme', 'people', 'new', 'age', 'type', 'beliefs', 'humanity', 'just', 'love', 'people', 'more', 'solve', 'problems', 'opposed', 'loving', 'God', 'more', 'then', 'loving', 'people', 'more', 'difference', 'end', 'day', 'do', 'believe', 'movie', 'MIGHT', 'be', 'decent', 'movie', 'help', 'jumpstart', 'thought', 'discussion', 'could', 'potentially', 'be', 'good', 'family', 'night', 'type', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'good', 'follow-up', 'discussion', 'would', 'be', 'warranted', 'bringing', 'out', 'things', 'discussed', 'above', 'using', 'movie', 'springboard', 'talking', 'how', 'Jesus', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'Christians', ""'re"", 'never', 'truly', 'alone', 'etc.Chris', 'LongMoviesForChristians', 'Movie', 'Reviewsmoviesforchristians', 'dot', 'org']",Because of Winn-Dixie

I read my daughter the book before seeing the movie, and was almost convinced by the negative reviews on here that the movie was not appropriate for her because they changed some details. My daughter is very smart and almost 6 and is not easily upset by things, and after my mother-in-law told me she watched the movie and saw nothing wrong with it, I decided to check it out with my daughter. Well, we both enjoyed it. Sure, there were a few minor changes, and some things were added to create more humor and drama, so in our opinion, it was better than the book. Although I do recommend reading the book as well. So what if some of the characters looked different than they were described in the book? Opal had blond hair instead of red, and Amanda had dark hair, instead of blond. Big whoop. The rest of the characters were just as described. And that little girl is adorable with her big doe eyes, and a great actress. I thought she is just as good and cute as Dakota Fanning. And the dog was funny and sweet. The scene we liked the best is the one with the Sherrif when he is harrassing Otis, and the animals decide to get revenge. I'm positive that he wasn't in the book, and although he was a bit cartoonish, he was funny, and played a good ""jerk"". I remember him as the weird hitch-hiker guy in ""There's something about Mary."" I recommend it highly as a good family flim that teaches the value of kindness and friendship. It's sentimental, yes, but I happen to like sentimental. It was enjoyable from beginning to end, and left you with a warm feeling inside. A mixture of sorrow and sweet. Like a Litmus Lozenge. Life is like that. Doesn't that kinda have a Forrest Gump feel to it? By the way, that is one of my favorite movies too.

Most books and films do the opposite: they use a child as a mouthpiece to express the author's pieties about the world. That's what happens here, where 10-year-old India Opal Baloney (a superbly trite name, that) discovers such gems as ""everyone's gotta find his own way through life,"" and ""you have to keep the ghosts of the bad things you've done at bay,"" and ""we're all basically swell deep down and should just get together and sing songs--kumbaya, preferably--and eat egg salad sandwiches."" And don't drink (liquor) because that's what made momma hit the road, that and Dad's utter fecklessness.Excellent cast of stock characters in this one, too (if you're still reading). Jeff Daniels plays the spine-of-jellyfish store-front preacher--a well-deserved fate given his apparent lack of ability. Cicely Tyson plays a younger version of her Miss Jane Pittman character, the Noble Black Woman Who Has Seen It All--er, until she went blind (making her even more noble). Dave Matthews plays the quiet musician (hey, just like in real life!) just out of prison for breaking his guitar over the head of a policeman. Hey, it was all just a misunderstanding because, see above, there are no bad people...now all join hands for kumbaya. Anyway, he loves animals and brings a big jar of pickles to a party, so he must be cool. The girl (India) is played as a cross between a saint and a sage...she grows tedious.Oh yeah, the dog, Windex (what my daughter thought he was called). He has a great scene where he burps, loudly, like a human. I laughed at that. (My wife chimes in: ""The dog was adorable!"")Virtually every Amazon reviewer seems to love this movie because it's a ""family"" movie--virtually no cussing and no sex. Fine; I'm all for that too.

908805,A3H82LUT1EC655,B0009NZ2KG,Erika Sorocco,"[9, 9]","Ten-year-old India Opal ""Opal"" (AnnaSophia Robb) moved to a small town in Florida in an attempt to please her father, the Preacher (Jeff Daniels), but she could never truly think of the place as home. Maybe it's because she has no friends in the new town, or maybe it's because she keeps thinking about her mother. The one who abandoned her when she was just 3-years-old. But that all changes one day when she steps into the local Winn-Dixie Grocery Store to pick up a box of macaroni and cheese, a bag of rice, and three tomatoes. For while she's browsing through the produce section, Opal sees a large dog run by, and soon the entire store is in an uproar as they try to catch the pesky intruder. When Opal finds out that they plan on sending the poor pooch to the pound, she announces that he's her dog, and soon, that's just what he is. Christened Winn-Dixie, Opal is soon spending each and every day with the lovable pup, and before she knows it, she's made many friends, all thanks to the fact that Winn-Dixie opens the door for her to meet new people - no matter how different they are.BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE is one of my favorite books. It always has been, and always will be. Which is why I knew that I needed to own a copy of this film, even before I saw it. AnnaSophia Robb (SAMANTHA: AN AMERICAN GIRL HOLIDAY and CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY) is outstanding as the girl who wants nothing more than a friend; while Jeff Daniels (CHEATERS and THE GOODBYE GIRL) couldn't be more amazing as the sullen Preacher, who does what he can to ensure a happy life for Opal. Though the person who steals the show - other than Winn-Dixie - is Dave Matthews (WHERE THE RED FERN GROWS) who is absolutely wonderful as the town loner, Otis, who is keeping a secret. With fabulous appearances by Harland Williams (KART RACER and FREDDY GOT FINGERED) as the goofy police officer; and Cicely Tyson (THE ROSA PARKS STORY and MS. SCROOGE) as Gloria, a profound blind woman who can teach anyone a lesson with words; as well as an appearance by Elle Fanning (THE DOOR IN THE FLOOR and DADDY DAY CARE) as the adorable Sweetie Pie Thomas.

908806,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,B0009NZ2KG,"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire""","[4, 12]","Hollywood seems to have a curious predilection for making charming and/or tragic films centered around dogs.  ""Old Yeller"" and ""Where the Red Fern Grows"", based on popular novels, are such examples.  2000's ""My Dog Skip"" was one of the best of recent times, an entertaining, dramatic tale.  But ""Because of Winn-Dixie"", also based on a book, is a pitiful rehash and retread of familiar ground, though not without its charms.10-year-old Opal (AnnaSophia Robb) and her preacher father (Jeff Daniels) have just moved to a decrepit little Florida town called Naomi, with a small church/convenience store, a pet shop, a library, and not much else; your classic breeding ground for simple, dramatic stories.  It appears that there's some friction between father and daughter, but it is not sufficiently explained for some time.  One day, while at the local Winn-Dixie supermarket, Opal witnesses a scruffy dog running about causing havoc for employees.  She claims him as hers and names him Winn-Dixie.It is through Winn-Dixie that Opal gets to know members of her tiny community, such as Otis, the pet store clerk (played quite beautifully by musician Dave Matthews), Gloria (Cicely Tyson), the obligatory creepy old lady, and Miss Franny (Eva Marie Saint), the librarian.  There are some other people in town of course; the cranky old guy who runs the trailer park where Opal and her father live, and some random kids who have their own problems, but are on screen only very briefly.And that's about it.  I just summarized the whole movie; and that's its problem:  nothing much happens.  Oh, sure, everyone in this dinky little town is drawn closer because of a dog, but beyond that, there isn't much story.Another problem with this film is a little something called ""false advertising"".  Watching the trailers, one would get the impression that this is a happy, light and silly family film about a cute little girl and a charming ugly dog, but in fact it is very serious, and at times, downright depressing.  There are many lengthy dramatic speeches and deeply emotional scenes, and not a lot of silly doggy antics.""Winn-Dixie"" is also highly predictable; there are no surprises.  Most of the dialogue is pre-processed clich&eacute; stuff (the Spam of dialogue, if you will), and the few events that do occur are blatantly phoned ahead.Certainly, little AnnaSophia is unbelievably cute, and Winn-Dixie is quite charming, but these are pretty much the highlights of this sappy story.The good thing about this film is that at least it doesn't have a ridiculously obvious moral to it.  I was really afraid as the movie drew to a close that one of the characters, most likely Opal, would look at the camera and give some speech about being nice to other people or something.

Credit director Wayne Wang and Joan Singleton's screenplay adaptation of Kate DiCamillo's fine novel for keeping this story simple, direct, terse, and most important, not allowing it to fold into a saccharine tearjerker.  As it stands it is quiet, true, and a worthwhile statement about how children view adults and their progress toward becoming one.Opal (AnnaSophia Robb) was deserted by her mother at age three and comes to live in a small Florida town with her brittle preacher father (Jeff Daniels).  She finds it difficult to adjust to the odd folk of the village until she adopts a terrific dog Winn-Dixie. Life blossoms for her until her dog is lost during a storm and she faces tragedy in her life once again. But this potential tragedy opens the door for her to relate to her father (and vice versa) and appreciate the disparate people who have befriended her.The film is shot in a very small scale in keeping with the story. There are no pretensions here: the people Opal meets include such fine character actors as Cicely Tyson, Eva Marie Saint, Dave Matthews and the remainder of the cast is to be respected for the understated manner in which they draw their characters.  Jeff Daniels (The Hours, The Squid and the Whale, Goodnight and Good Luck, The Goodbye Girl, Gods and Generals, etc) continues to prove that he is one of our finer actors on the screen and stage:  when an actor of his stature takes on a film like this, one is almost guaranteed it is a worthwhile film to see.  Not a great movie, but a very good one that provides a healthy breath of fresh air to the current choices of downer movies.

She fell asleep. I watched the whole thing, and it isn't terrible, but it also isn't terribly good, either. (Granted, mom does sleep a lot, but this fun yet forgettable flick isn't one to grab and keep one's attention.)Annasophia Robb as Opal, the main character, is very cute, but not very convincing in her role. Winn Dixie, the other lead actor, is not all that cute (in my opinion), but is a capable actor. He is quite convincing in his role as a dog, I might add. Opal names the shaggy, lovable mut Winn-Dixie, after the name of the grocery store where she finds him as a stray wreaking havoc in the produce section. She goes through the usual troubles that a kid has convincing her parent that she be allowed to keep him.Opal has recently moved to a small town where she lives with her effete father in a trailer home, and where her dad is ""The Preacher"". Dad is a kindly, if weak, person who is stuck in the sorrow he still suffers because his wife has left them several years ago. Opal tries to understand about her mother. She also tries to make friends, which turns out to be difficult, but interesting. This lonely girl just MUST be able to keep the dog, Winn-Dixie; he's a girls best friend. Her only friend at first, really.In the course of the show, the assorted figures of the town, each with his own life ""story"", are touched and ultimately brought together because of Winn-Dixie. My favorite figure is the blind, reclusive Gloria brilliantly played by Cicely Tyson. People (the Dewberry brothers, for instance) fear the eccentric elderly woman, but once they get to know her, they find out that she is both friendly and wise. Don't expect everything in this story to make a lot of sense. But it's OK if you are just looking for light diversion.You might also enjoy the even better family movie featuring a girl and her pet is ""Dreamer"", with Dakota Fanning as a little girl who never gives up on her injured racehorse, Sonador. I know that my mom likes that one. Also, I'm going to read to her Kate DiCamilo's award-winning children's book ""Winn Dixie"" which the movie is based on.

908823,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009NZ2KG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","Last night I happened to be watching an episode of ""Ghost Whisperer"" in which a father and son have become estranged after the death of the woman who was their wife and mother.  From beyond the grave she is trying to bring them back together and there is a point at which the father finally reveals the depths of his loss and tells his son, ""She was your mother, but she was my wife.""  Today I watched ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" and waited for the moment for the father in this film to say essentially the same thing to his daughter, recognizing that it would not be until the end of the film and once the catalyst of the title character, an abandoned mutt adopted by the daughter, has worked his magic.The daughter is 10-year-old Opal (AnnaSophia Robb, and not, as my wife assumed, Dakota Fanning), who lives with her father, Preacher (Jeff Daniels) in a trailer.  That name is his vocation, and his new church is being run out of a convenience store.  In time we find out that Opal's mother has run away and her father does not want to talk about it, even though every time she asks if her mother left anything behind when she left he fails to provide the obvious answer until the end of the movie.  He also does not want Opal to keep the dog she has found, a mutt representing some hitherto unknown breed of canine.  They are not allowed to have pets in the trailer, but despite his general insensitivity towards the life his daughter is leading when she points out that the dog is her only friend in the world, he relents and allows the first crack in their frozen relationship to be made.This 2005 film is really a children's movie, not just because the main character is a child but also because you need the innocence of that perspective not to be disgusted by her father.  The fact that he is a preacher, and therefore accustomed to ministering to members of a congregation who are experiencing the loss of a loved one, only heightens his failure to respond to the emotional pain of his daughter.  I realize that the basic dynamic here of the parent and child separated by the loss of a common loved one who find each other again is an old one (it is the basis of ""The Secret Garden"" even though the parent and child are not related and they have lost different loved ones), but for many children this will only be like the tenth time they have seen such a story.Both the kid and the dog are both cute and competent, and if you want to be an adult and look start calculating how much property damage Winn-Dixie is causing in this film then do not be surprised that you are not enjoying it as much as the little ones.  While we wait for Winn-Dixie to bring Opal and Preacher back together, you have the likes of Cecily Tyson, Eva Marie Saint, and Dave Matthews running around as loveable eccentrics who become part of the extended family that the little girl and the great big dog are creating together.  ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" is directed by Wayne Wang, who last did ""Maid in Manhattan"" but should be better known for ""The Joy Luck Club,"" and is based on Kate DiCamillo's novel.  Despite its basic predictability, it is an enjoyable enough film that should delight children and those who are still capable of taking that perspective.",4,A cute kid and a cute dog forgive a lot in a predictable story,1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,3239,"['Last', 'night', 'happened', 'be', 'watching', 'episode', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer', 'father', 'son', 'have', 'become', 'estranged', 'death', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'wife', 'mother', 'grave', 'trying', 'bring', 'back', 'together', 'point', 'father', 'finally', 'depths', 'loss', 'son', 'was', 'mother', 'was', 'wife', 'Today', 'watched', 'Winn-Dixie', 'waited', 'moment', 'father', 'film', 'say', 'essentially', 'same', 'thing', 'daughter', 'recognizing', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'end', 'film', 'once', 'catalyst', 'title', 'character', 'abandoned', 'mutt', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'worked', 'magic.The', 'daughter', '10-year-old', 'Opal', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'not', 'wife', 'assumed', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'father', 'Preacher', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'trailer', 'name', 'vocation', 'new', 'church', 'being', 'run', 'convenience', 'store', 'time', 'find', 'out', 'Opal', 'mother', 'run', 'away', 'father', 'not', 'want', 'talk', 'even', 'time', 'mother', 'left', 'anything', 'when', 'left', 'provide', 'obvious', 'answer', 'end', 'movie', 'also', 'not', 'want', 'Opal', 'keep', 'dog', 'found', 'mutt', 'representing', 'hitherto', 'unknown', 'breed', 'canine', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'have', 'pets', 'trailer', 'general', 'insensitivity', 'life', 'daughter', 'leading', 'when', 'out', 'dog', 'only', 'friend', 'world', 'first', 'crack', 'frozen', 'relationship', 'be', 'made.This', '2005', 'film', 'really', 'children', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'main', 'character', 'child', 'also', 'need', 'innocence', 'perspective', 'not', 'be', 'disgusted', 'father', 'fact', 'preacher', 'therefore', 'accustomed', 'ministering', 'members', 'congregation', 'who', 'are', 'experiencing', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'only', 'failure', 'respond', 'emotional', 'pain', 'daughter', 'realize', 'basic', 'dynamic', 'here', 'parent', 'child', 'separated', 'loss', 'common', 'loved', 'one', 'who', 'find', 'other', 'again', 'old', 'one', 'basis', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'even', 'parent', 'child', 'are', 'not', 'related', 'have', 'lost', 'different', 'loved', 'ones', 'many', 'children', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'tenth', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'story.Both', 'kid', 'dog', 'are', 'cute', 'competent', 'want', 'be', 'adult', 'look', 'start', 'calculating', 'how', 'much', 'property', 'damage', 'Winn-Dixie', 'causing', 'film', 'then', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'are', 'not', 'enjoying', 'as', 'much', 'little', 'ones', 'wait', 'Winn-Dixie', 'bring', 'Opal', 'Preacher', 'back', 'together', 'have', 'likes', 'Cecily', 'Tyson', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'running', 'around', 'loveable', 'eccentrics', 'who', 'become', 'part', 'extended', 'family', 'little', 'girl', 'great', 'big', 'dog', 'are', 'creating', 'together', 'Winn-Dixie', 'directed', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'who', 'last', 'did', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'should', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'Joy', 'Luck', 'Club', 'based', 'Kate', 'DiCamillo', 'novel', 'basic', 'predictability', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'film', 'should', 'delight', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'capable', 'taking', 'perspective']",Because of Winn-Dixie

Yes, THAT Dave Matthews (of the Dave Matthews Band). Here, he is given a couple of plaintive guitar solos in his pet shop, and it actually works. Being a DMB Fan, it was sort of ironic to see one of my favorite musicians sitting on the ground next to pigs and rabbits, with a dog and a little girl for an audience, and as 'Otis', his role here is not very well written either. But he is a revelation in the screen time he does have, because I really think he has that *it* factor which makes him watchable no matter what.Thankfully, this is no Disney flick. So themes of separation, broken families, lies, betrayal and young loneliness are all given due importance. This was crucial to whether the film worked or not, and here it works in spades. The best part is the dog - and yes, they do make him cute and fluffy here and there, but the beast itself looks more like a rough worn horse, and this works as well.The lead actress isn't exceptional, but brings a light, warm freshness to her role that maybe other actresses could not have. She is India Opal here, a motherless child who has no friends, and her immediate friendship with stranger mongrel 'Winn Dixie' forms the basis of this sweet story.Like all kid-and-their-dog movies, the duo make new friends (an old woman, an old man, etc) and there is a lost-and-found segment that also seems cliched, but hey, this is solid family entertainment that is absolutely suitable for any age group.

908834,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B0009NZ2KG,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[0, 0]","This movie is based off of a cute children's book by the same name.  Don't let the title fool you though, this is about a dog and a girl, not a supermarket.  And it's a good family movie, appropriate for all ages.Opal is having a boring summer hanging out in the town she and her Preacher father just moved to.  She's having trouble making friends and the loneliness makes her dwell on the loss of her mother, who left them when she was three.  So when Opal comes across a stray dog at the local Winn-Dixie, she brings him home, despite the trailer court rules against animals.  But Winn-Dixie (as she calls him) opens her world up and helps her make new friends.Characters:AnnaSophia Robb: Opal BuloniJeff Daniels: Opal's fatherCicely Tyson: Gloria DumpLuke Benward: Steven DewberryDave Matthews: OtisEva Marie Saint: Ms. Franny BlockThe characters are actually where this movie is kind of weak.  Robb does a decent job as Opal.  She's certainly childlike and whimsical and she has a friendly personality.  But Daniels as her father was unconvincing, like he didn't know what type of father he wanted to be and never really figured it out through the whole movie.  Gloria Dump, played by Tyson, was a little stange.  A local witch figure you were supposed to see past the rumors, but even if she did have a good heart, she still wasn't the most comforting of people.  The same could apply to Otis and Franny Block as well, the other adult friends that Opal makes.  Personally if I were her dad I'd want to at least meet these people.  And then there's the five year old child running around loose with no supervision.  Maybe it's because I grew up in a large town, but yeesh!  And then there's the policeman.  They made this poor guy the stupidest person in the whole movie, which since this is a kid's movie, might not be the best thing to project.The plot followed the book well enough.  It could be meandering at times, and some of the stories were a little out there.  This is one that kids will probably get a lot more enjoyment out of than adults.  Although there are some parts adults might enjoy.  I have to say that I liked the book better, but that seems to be the case with most things.  At any rate, since this is a kid's movie, there's nothing inappropriate contained within it (except for one minor cuss word) and the kids all learn the lessons of learning about people before judging, who real family is, and other such sappy things.The film was shot nicely.  It had an old time feel to it even though Opal's dad had a laptop.  It certainly took place in a quaint town.  The dog trainers were very good, as Winn Dixie was always on hand for a smile or a trick (I still can't figure out if that dog is actually smiling or if they altered the video to make it look like he was).  If they did alter it, it was a good job.  And Gloria's house was an especially beautiful set.  There was some music, but it was mostly background and hymn music, so I didn't really pay attention to it.  The one character was a guitar player, and he played a few nice tunes, but no complete songs.A cute movie for kids but probably not as popular with the older crowd.  They could clean up the meandering plotline a bit and probably have something a bit more popular.  But as is, this is an average movie.Review by M.

908839,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0009NZ2KG,Only-A-Child,"[4, 5]","It should be no secret by now that ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" is a children's film, its target audience of pre-teens  are meant to be entranced by the title character and the many cute animals even if they have not read the book from which the film was adapted.  This moderate budget ($20 Million) film made a lot of money by carefully targeting this audience with a fairy tale story where there are no really ""bad"" people.Being a children's film is not a fault or at least should not be a fault.  But teenagers and adults should understand going in that ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" is not on the ""family film"" level of ""Monkey Trouble"" or ""My Dog Skip"".  There is less here for older viewers unless they are willing to let themselves view the film from a child's eyes.That said there are some elements for more sophisticated viewers if they just look hard enough.Director Wayne Wang engages in a fair amount of self-parody.  Although 10 year old Opal (the main human character) is played realistically, Dakota Fanning's little sister Elle's character is (intentionally) one of the most sugary in film history, appropriately named Sweetie Pie Thomas.  John McConnell and Harland Williams play the crybaby grocery store manager and the goofy sheriff with a kind of homage to Barney Fife and Roscoe P. Coltraine.Jeff Daniels gives an excellent performance as Opal's somewhat distanced father.  Daniels plays the character with a nice balance.  The father-daughter scenes are very believable and by far the best part of the film.  There were many ways that these scenes could have gone wrong but Daniels manages to dodge the traps and give us a conflicted character with whom to connect.Dave Matthews, Cecily Tyson, and Eva Marie Saint are interesting in supporting roles.Finally there is AnnaSophia Robb (Opal), who like Scout in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" provides voiceover narration to help flesh out the storyline.  Unlike Sweetie Pie, Robb underplays her character nicely, and is ""pleasingly cute"" as a Tomboy with great big eyes and a young Jodie Foster/Lindsey Lohen style.  This was her first feature but she quickly followed it up with a role in the new ""Willy Wonka"" movie, the two roles are polar opposites so it appears that Robb has a decent about of versatility.  She should have quite a future as an actress.Then again, what do I know?

Gorey ""Behemoth""","[3, 8]","Despite an earnest cast and some striking photography, this film somehow misses the mark, though from the previous reviews, it appears to have pleased many people. The book is a mystical and ""new-agey"" type of story in the ""Legend of Bagger Vance"" vein, and the themes in it are intriguing. But somehow these qualities are lost in the translation to this easygoing, unchallenging movie adaptation. Kids may find it amusing, but the more esoteric concepts are poorly handled, (specifically the power of the Litmus Lozenges) and the secondary characters tend to be distractions: the labored comedy of a deputy sherrif made us wince when we saw the film. That the story goes on for too long may have been forgivable, had there been more momentum, suspense, or intrigue, but ""Dixie's"" ambling pacing works against it. The young star is appealing, and quite pretty, but unremarkable as a performer, and she's let down by a director who misunderstands the material. To those looking for a truly involving family film, I might suggest Alfonzo Cuaron's ""A Little Princess"" (1995) to see how such things could be done.

India Opal can't find anyone to be friends with, until on a routine trip to the grocery store, she meets an adorable stray dog she names Winn-Dixie. Winn-Dixie is quite a bit better at making friends than India Opal is, and the two of them then go around doing so. It doesn't sound all that interesting, but it is.Wang and screenwriter Joan Singleton keep the light sheen of magical realism overlying the story intact without overplaying it, and the movie is awash in good performances. Both Robb and Daniels work well in their roles, and the rest of the minor characters are well-cast.A fine adaptation of a wonderful book, well worth your time.

But then again, most movie adaptations of children's books do the same (see Ella Enchanted).  Walk Two Moons and Bridge to Terabithia movie adaptations are both coming out soon.  Maybe the filmakers will actually put forth effort on those films.It seems as if young Anna Sophia Robb's (I don't care if I mispelled her name)only talent is to be able to smile and say her lines in a cutesy voice.  Dave Matthews, I pray, never uses that faux-Southern accent again.  The other adult characters do well enough, though I've never really been a fan of Jeff Daniels.  Oh, and I musn't forget the loveable Winn-Dixie.  Why is it that in every movie intended for someone under ten is there at least one burp and/or fart joke.  When I saw Winn-Dixie smile-literally-I was immedietly prepared for the worst.  Good thing I was.  This is tripe.

Opal's mother ran off when she was young, leaving her to be raised by her father (Jeff Daniels) who happens to be a preacher--which is also what Opal calls him.  The father and daughter move to a new town in the South U.S. where Preacher has a new congregation that meets in an old store.  Opal is lonely.  She loves her father, but as a preacher he has an entire congregation that he is responsible for, too.  Opal longs for a friend and while in the local Winn-Dixie supermarket one day, she meets a stray dog there that is causing trouble.  The dog obeys Opal's voice and soon becomes her constant companion.  With Winn-Dixie as her guide and companion, Opal sets off on some very interesting adventures, rekindles her relationship with her dad, and befriends a wide variety of people, from an elderly librarian to a shady pet store worker.  Through all of her encounters Opal learns that love is a powerful force, sometimes so powerful that the only way we can grow is to let go of the things we love most.BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE offers some fine performances.  AnnaSophia Robb captures the youthful innocence, wandering spirit, and awkward emotional growth of Opal perfectly.  Jeff Daniels is directly on as Preacher.  Dave Matthews makes a startling good debut performance as pet store worker, Otis, and I have to say it was nice to see Matthew on a more human playing-field than the divine-like status his cult of followers have placed him upon.  Cicely Tyson and Eva Marie Saint also have roles and round out part of Opal's closest inner circle.BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE is a good family film.  The film is full of quirky characters, but they are characters that every child could meet if they lived in a safe place that was open to letting children be themselves instead of pretending they were adults.
