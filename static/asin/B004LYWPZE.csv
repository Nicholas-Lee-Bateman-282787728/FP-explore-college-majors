Actually it was the opposite of a thriller, it had a hypnotic slow pacing throughout the film as relaxing as listening to New Age music.Great expressive acting with lots and lots of emotional close-ups of all three stars. Rourke plays a musician working the Dream Lounge.  He's losing his battle with drugs and drink in a most proud and dignified way while being hounded by Bill Murray's henchmen.

Not only is she beautiful and  ethereal and mysterious, but her voice is as sweet as Melanie Griffiths'.  Her character is pure and vulnerable and loyal to Rourke, but Murray finds her irresistable.

So how could this not get a theatrical release? Oh I know because Megan Fox isn't very liked in Hollywood right now. You could have taken this same script and put Natalie Portman in it and it would have been a hit. This movie wasn't bad at all it was actually a interesting love story. I felt honestly this was her best acting yet. I honestly didn't think she was capable of such.  I really didn't see Megan Fox I saw a woman in pain and tormented.  Mickey Rourke did a great job in his performance as well. This is a shame that Conan the Barbarian would get a release before something like this. Well unfortunately the critics rid the world of opportunity to discover something different. I can see that originality isn't Hollywood's strong point anymore. ""Black Swan"" was a wonder and I am surprised it was received as well as it was. This movie isn't Black Swan but it does have great qualities about it .

""Passion Play"" partially answers the question. This is one original and touching project, which stars Mickey Rourke, Megan Fox and Bill Murray - quite fascinating casting.Mickey Rourke plays Nate, a famous, has-been trumpet player, who we meet at the beginning of the film. He just finished a gig, and just when he was getting ready to go home, somebody hits him on the head. Next thing, he is in the Mexican desert, ready to be executed by a hit man. Amazingly, some strangers save him, just about when he was ready to say goodbye for good. However, he is left alone, without transportation or means of communication, wandering in the desert. Eventually, he finds a traveling carnival in the middle of nowhere, where he meets Lily, an incredibly beautiful woman, who happens to have wings - a bird woman, she calls herself. He falls for her and tries to take her away. Unfortunately, he is discovered by Sam (Rhys Ifans), the owner of the carnival, who will not allow his main attraction to be taken away. Amazingly again, just when Nate is going to be whacked by Sam, he is saved at the last minute, this time by Lily herself. They run away, with Sam promising to get her back. Once in the city, Nate makes a deal with Happy Shannon (Bill Murray), a gangster, to spare his life and debt, and make some profit together, by using Lily in an attraction, namely a lucrative freak. Sadly for Nate, things don't go as planned, and he will soon realize his mistake.""Passion Play"" is different, and, as I said, original. It plays as a fantasy, and should be watched as such. It is a story about love and redemption, aided by stylish cinematography by Christopher Doyle. It is worth a look. (USA, 2010. color, 94 mins).

1419571,A29IYGR7SNPRIV,B004LYWPZE,"Charlotte Vale-Allen ""writerinresidence""","[3, 12]","This is truly the worst movie I've seen in quite some time. It is so bad, in fact, that it makes the other films I thought were bad (Tooth Fairy; Eat, Pray Love) actually look halfway decent. It is silly and simplistic. Mickey Rourke as someone women find attractive is just a ludicrous concept, given that his face looks like it's been previously used by several other people. His character is a complete cliche: the formerly successful musician wrecked by fame, disillusionment and drugs. A sad waste of Bill Murray in another cliched role as the semi-elegant thug with weird taste in housing. Then there's the very limited Megan Fox who gives a striking performance (as once was famously said by Dorothy Parker of  Katharine Hepburn) that runs the gamut of emotions from A to B. She's very pretty. Acting ability is not one of her skills. This Grade C film is crowded with A-list actors who have to have been under the impression that they were in a far better movie and probably wept at the premiere or tried to sneak away before anyone saw them. Or maybe they did it for the money. Whatever the reason, it's just terrible.

I can see why this film was blasted by the critics.Megan Fox plays a woman who is part bird. Hey, if you have real feather wings, you're part bird. Mickey Rourke plays an aging trumpet player who gets involved with the bird. Bill Murray is a ruthless gangster who wants the bird for himself. Does all of this sound silly? It is.I thought the whole thing was a big waste of money. I could not take it seriously at all, and clearly the people who produced this big-budget drama wanted it to be taken very seriously. It seems likely that they thought this film would answer some of life's heaviest questions. Perhaps a little levity would have helped. So, I'll suggest a few changes. First, you'll notice that Rourke wears pants that are too short, so he shows a lot of white sock. I suggest scenes in which Rourke's socks do not match. When a bad guy points this out, fisticuffs erupt.  Also, I could see the trumpet playing tied to the flying. That is, when Rourke plays with intense feeling, perhaps sweating profusely, the bird really soars.As for Bill Murray, I have a hard time accepting him as a bloodthirsty gangster.

It's a bit offbeat and very entertaining.  It draws you into it and you can't wait to see how it is going to come out.  Was interesting to see Bill Murray as a villain, after seeing him in so many light comedy roles.  He is completely convincing and pulls it off very well.  If I hadn't seen his name in the credits, I might not have recognized him for a while.  Was not that familiar with Mickey Rourke or Megan Fox, but both were amazing in this.

It goes through all of the motions but not enough clicks to make the movie work.Mitch Glazer wrote and directed this movie and he enlisted his high school friend Mickey Rourke and his wife (Kelly Lynch) to be in the movie. Bill Murray stars as a mafia boss named Happy. Murray puts a spark into nearly every scene and might have the most interesting character in the entire movie - the mob boss with a love for art and beauty. Rourke's character (Nick Pool) is a down and our jazz player that has been sleeping with Happy's wife so Happy orders Rourke to be taken out to the desert and executed. As Pool waits a shot to the forehead the mobsters are killed by Indians who run away into the desert.Pool runs as well and stumbles onto a creepy carnival in the middle of the desert. He goes into the freak show tent and discovers that the woman with wings display is not fake - she really has wings. The carnival owner has raised her from childhood and both uses and protects her - but he is clear that he will kill to keep her.Nate and the winged girl Lily (Megan Fox) escape and Nate makes plans to sell her to Happy in order to get back in Happy's good graces. Along the way Pool and Lily fall in love and they work to figure out a way to be together and escape from the carnival owner and Happy.As I noted, Bill Murray did a great job of playing the ironically named Happy. Mickey Rourke was absolutely believable as the down and out musician - let's face it, he lived it as a down and out actor.

Now gangster Happy Shannon (funnyman Bill Murray of ""Groundhog Day"") wants him dead.  While escaping from one of Happy's thugs, Nate stumbles upon a carnival sideshow owned by Sam (Rhys Ifans of ""Hannibal Rising"").  Nate helps one of the freaks, Lily (Megan Fox of ""Jennifer`s Body""), a girl with wings, escape the sideshow.  He plans to have her work for Happy in hopes that the gangster will allow him to live.  Unfortunately, Happy can't be trusted.Director Mitch Glazer's ""Passion Play"" is the most bizarre combination of science fiction fantasy and noir I've ever seen.  There are scenes that generate such great tension that my breath was literally taken away.  Megan Fox is simply incredible as the innocent, nave, attractive Lily who craves to look like other girls.  My heart broke for her, knowing that she was being duped by the despicable Nate Pool.  He's a coarse, slimy loser that I never much liked.  However, towards the end, Nate does experience a change in heart which causes the viewer to root for him as he eludes Happy's thugs.""Passion Play"" does contain some bloody surprises and shocks, which make it a good noir.  The desert scenes were beautiful in their bare, breathtaking majesty - the land from which Lily is taken.  She is transported to the gritty, dirty big city where the bloody love triangle of this bizarre passion play begins to reveal itself.  Poor, lonely Lily finds herself at the center of at least three men who all want to exploit her for her unusual body.  (Many women find themselves in the same situation as Lily.  They just want to be loved for themselves.)  In her desperation to be accepted as normal, Lily seeks medical advice in having her wings removed.  Little does she know that this unusual gift will eventually bring her freedom.While watching ""Passion Play,"" I was reminded of best-selling author James Patterson's ""When the Wind Blows"" and its equally superb sequel ""The Lake House.""  Both novels involve the exploitation of children who have been genetically engineered to have bird-like wings.  They can actually fly.  Lily was born with wings.  Sam, the owner of the sideshow, found her in the garbage when she was a baby.  Unfortunately, he would never allow her to ""leave the nest.""  In Patterson's novels, a veterinarian, Frannie O'Neill, and an FBI agent, Kit Brennan, help the children escape evil scientists and their laboratories.If one is tired of the same old bloody, shoot-`em-up crime drama, then I recommend viewing ""Passion Play,"" which has a lot of heart.  The film's hero, Nate Pool, finds himself in the biggest moral dilemma of his life; he risks death for a woman with whom he had no intention of falling in love.  Unfortunately, Image Entertainment's DVD release is lacking in special features.  (At least my copy was.)  The film is presented in its theatrical release aspect ratio of 2.40:1 and has SDH and Spanish subtitles.  However, it doesn't have any special features such as audio commentaries, deleted/extended scenes, bloopers, ""making of"" documentaries, cast/crew interviews, etc.On the DVD, there is a trailer for ""Passion Play"" as well as trailers for three other Image Entertainment films of various genres:  The first is for ""Burning Palms,"" the bizarre anthology of five sexually-explicit stories that are both shocking and horrifying; the second is for ""Wild Cherry,"" a raunchy teen flick in which a group of girls get revenge on the guys who've sexually exploited them; and the third is for ""The Violent Kind,"" a grisly horror film where three male friends go to a party in the boonies and are viciously attacked and tortured by insane country bumpkins.  Of the three, ""Burning Palms"" is probably the most original.Joseph B.

1419579,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004LYWPZE,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 2]","Nate Pool (Mickey Rourke) is an aging musician who is taken out into the desert to be killed, but narrowly escapes the clutches of death and wanders into a carnival where he sees Lily (Megan Fox), a beautiful girl with wings. In Lily, Nate not only sees something special, but also a way to save his own life from Happy Shannon (Bill Murray), the gangster who tried to have him killed in the first place.So begins Passion Play, the directorial debut of screenwriter Mitch Glazer. Passion Play was supposed to have a theatrical release, but disastrous test screenings lead the studio to release it in only a couple theatres and then quietly push it into the home video market. While they may try to beat around the bush about it, it's a direct-to-DVD movie. Something's got to be wrong when you have two Oscar-nominated actors and an actress who has become the dreamgirl of millions of adult males in one movie and it can't get a theatrical release. Well, yes, there is a lot wrong with it and it's not just the off-beat story, which probably caused migraines for many executives over how to market it.Mickey Rourke publicly disclosed (and then later recanted) that he thought this film was ""terrible"" and that he basically only took the role for the money. It's a testament to his skill as an actor that he can turn in such an effective performance that elicits genuine sympathy when his heart wasn't in it. Rourke has a hardened gentleness about him that he's able to exploit for the characters he inhabits. You know Nate Pool has been through a lot because you know Rourke has been through a lot and you want good things to happen for Nate, because you want good things to happen for Mickey. When Nate cries, Mickey cries, and it makes you want to cry.  Passion Play is not lacking in the acting department and the performances are actually quite good Murray is exceptional as the deadpan gangster and Fox is finally able to play a character that isn't just a sexpot, but, alas, isn't given the opportunity to prove that she has much range as an actress. Yes, I had sympathy for her character but it's not a particularly dynamic role. With these performances, as well as Rhys Ifans in a small role, this does not feel like straight-to-DVD fare.In fact, very little of the film seems like straight-to-DVD fare except for some weak, downright lazy writing and an amateurish ending (that involves some embarrassingly bad CGI). It's mostly well-made and very well-shot with a very dream-like quality to it. Its biggest blunder comes from a lack of direction in Glazer's writing and direction. There is a good story here that just got lost in the presentation. It's just not convincing enough. When it should be heartbreaking and thought-provoking, it comes off as laughable and too ""weird."" If you've ever seen a film and you knew it was trying to convey an interesting idea, but you didn't know what that idea was...That's how I think Glazer felt while writing the script. He knew he was trying to convey an interesting idea, but he didn't know the meaning behind it. Additionally, there's some lazy writing where you can see Glazer has dug himself into a hole and had to introduce a contrived plot device to dig himself out of it (if you've seen the film, tell me I have not just described the return of Ifans' character).Glazer was working with great actors who give great performances under the circumstances, but he doesn't seem to know how to handle this material. It's sensitive material, as the story moves in such a realistic way, but you're also asking an audience to really suspend their disbelief. You must find a comfortable balance with the realism and the supernatural elements for the film to work. While Passion Play does a mostly good job of maintaining a dreamy, realistic tone it has moments of near-camp.There are several poorly executed moments throughout the film, but it is the final moments that push the film into the realm of complete ridiculousness. It's an ending that adds meaning to all of the events that preceded it, while simultaneously rendering them irrelevant. From a writing standpoint, it's forced, uncreative, and sappy. From a cinematic and emotional standpoint, it's a confusing array of bad CGI, poor direction, and conflicted emotions. It's a laughable moment. It's a sad moment. But it's never a poignant moment.I want to give Glazer the benefit of a doubt and attribute his missteps in the direction to lack-of-funding or studio intervention, but I don't know how to excuse the flaws in his writing. I think what is ultimately responsible for the failure of Passion Play is that it had a director who was not ready to direct and a writer who was not through polishing his script. The biggest problem is that this writer and director is the same person. The star-power no doubt came as the result of favors, studio encouragement, and decent sized paychecks. There was some money that came into play here, but where's the passion?GRADE: C",3,An Interesting Film That Ultimately Doesn't Work,1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,4980,"['Nate', 'Pool', 'Mickey',

1419581,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004LYWPZE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 13]","If nothing else, Mitch Glazer's ""Passion Play"" scores points for being different.  Part existential drama, part swoony romance, part gangster epic, and part fantasy parable--this offbeat tale actually works better than you might anticipate.  Expecting relatively little, I bought into this adult fairytale and its eccentricities.  For its first hour, it spins a rather sweet fable with deceptively hard edges.  It is in this juxtaposition of moods and themes that the movie really sets itself apart.  But after establishing an effective premise and winning me over--the film suddenly loses a bit of momentum, takes a complete tonal shift, and ends on a rather unsubtle note meant to be uplifting and fraught with meaning.  It's like there was an intriguing idea for a story, but the movie doesn't know how to get to its end in a dramatically cohesive way.  Still, I liked the film--but I definitely felt a division between its parts.  The first hour rated about 4 stars, but the final thirty minutes kind of felt hollow for me.When a hapless jazz musician (Mickey Rourke) raises the ire of a local gangster (Bill Murray), he soon finds himself looking down the barrel of a gun.  Narrowing avoiding execution, he stumbles upon a traveling carnival and becomes enchanted with Megan Fox who performs as a sideshow attraction.  I'm sure plenty of reviews and descriptions of the movie will give you more information--but I think the film works best if you let a few surprises occur naturally.  Soon Fox and Rourke hit the road but their blossoming romance is threatened by Rourke's need to square himself with Murray.  Fox's allure may be just the ticket to saving his life.  Through no fault of the actors, it is when Fox and Murray meet that the film starts to lose a bit of its life force.  Who, if anyone, will end up with whom?  Or are there greater powers at work on this trio of damaged souls?Rourke is an interesting presence here--understated and believable.  Fox displays credible vulnerability and acquits herself well.  However, the grand success of the movie depends on them having an impassioned bond.  And although both are good independently, I never felt the real heat of connection and chemistry.  The illusion of their romance is not able to withstand their separation--and the longing looks and teary wistfulness were never entirely convincing for me.  Murray, for his part, also restrains himself with a sly menace that serves the piece well.

As their lives quickly intertwine, things go from bad to worse when they run away from her overprotective carny father (Rhys Ifans) and into the spiraling web of the mobster who wants Nate dead, Happy Shannon (Bill Murray).The premise is interesting. Not quite a noir tale, not quite magical realism... Passion Play, if I may be a bit spoilerish, is a tale of Purgatory. Unfortunately, it's not artfully done. It's too real and mundane to be fantastic, other than Lily's wings, and too casual about said wings for anyone to take it seriously. The ending is the only brave thought in the film, and even it is tainted by the plodding narrative and superfluous side characters.Passion Play attempts subtlety through lingering character shots and uninspired dialogue delivered with horrible timing by both Rourke and Fox. Ultimately, it all falls flat. Bill Murray's Happy is the most interesting part, but even his poetic lines lack for drama and poignancy. I don't think that's his fault, though. The entire piece is earnest, but fails.If you're looking for noirish films that deal with similar subject matters, I'd probably recommend The Salton Sea. Passion Play?

He is taken out into the desert to be shot when suddenly a group of Native Americans, dressed in white, shoot his killer. Nate walks until he reaches a sideshow carnival, complete with a woman with huge angel wings (Meagan Fox) named Lily Luster (short for Lilith, a fallen angel?). As the carnies are ready to kill Poole, Lily rescues him.Rhys Ifans plays Sam Adamo (another Biblical reference as Lilith in mythology was Adam's first wife). He is the head carny and Lily's caretaker. Nate plans to exploit Meagan by going back to the mobster Happy Shannon (Bill Murray) who is anything but happy, as he is a &#34;recent widower.&#34; Nate is aided by Harriet (Kelly Lynch) who runs the &#34;Dream Lounge&#34; in case you thought we were running out of symbols/metaphors. Oh yes, Happy's real name is &#34;Michael&#34; like the angel.Poole seems to ruin his chance for redemption when he decides to exploit &#34;angel.&#34; The movie contains tons of slow, seemingly useless, endless dialouge. The Sartre ending was expected as soon as the first shot was fired. This is more of an &#34;indie&#34; style movie or perhaps an &#34;art&#34; film. I think everybody will find something boring in this film in spite of the haphazard use of metaphors.F-bombs, one dimly lit sex scene, nudity (not Meagan).",3,LOOKS PRETTY GOOD FOR A GIRL WITH A HUMP,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,1443,"['slow', 'moving', 'neo-noir', 'modern', 'western', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Nate', 'Poole', 'jazz', 'player', 'has-been', 'who', 'been', 'caught', 'mobster', 'wife', 'taken', 'out', 'desert', 'be', 'shot', 'when', 'suddenly', 'group', 'Native', 'Americans', 'dressed', 'white', 'shoot', 'killer', 'Nate', 'walks', 'sideshow', 'carnival', 'complete', 'woman', 'huge', 'angel', 'wings', 'Meagan', 'Fox', 'named', 'Lily', 'Luster', 'short', 'Lilith', 'fallen', 'angel', 'carnies', 'are', 'ready', 'kill', 'Poole', 'Lily', 'him.Rhys', 'Ifans', 'plays', 'Sam', 'Adamo', 'Biblical', 'reference', 'Lilith', 'mythology', 'was', 'Adam', 'first', 'wife', 'head', 'carny', 'Lily', 'caretaker', 'Nate', 'exploit', 'Meagan', 'going', 'back', 'mobster', 'Happy', 'Shannon', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'who', 'anything', 'happy', '34', 'recent', 'widower.', '34', 'Nate', 'aided', 'Harriet', 'Kelly', 'Lynch', 'who', '34', 'Dream', 'Lounge', '34', 'case', 'thought', 'were', 'running', 'out', 'symbols/metaphors', 'Oh', 'yes', 'Happy', 'real', 'name', '34', 'Michael', '34', 'angel.Poole', 'ruin', 'chance', 'redemption', 'when', 'exploit', '34', 'angel.', '34', 'movie', 'tons', 'slow', 'seemingly', 'useless', 'endless', 'dialouge', 'Sartre', 'ending', 'was', 'expected', 'as', 'soon', 'first', 'shot', 'was', 'fired', 'more', '34', 'indie', '34', 'style', 'movie', 'perhaps', '34', 'art', '34', 'film', 'think', 'everybody', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'boring', 'film', 'spite', 'haphazard', 'use', 'metaphors.F-bombs', 'one', 'dimly', 'lit', 'sex', 'scene', 'nudity', 'not', 'Meagan']",Passion Play

""Passion Play"" (and no, it has nothing to do with the Christian Ritual dramatic presentation about the Death of Jesus) features Mickey Rourke, Bill Murray and Megan Fox in a love triangle over an angel. That angel happens to be Fox, who Rourke discovers in a carnival sideshow after surviving a mob hit ordered by Murray's gangster, Happy. But Happy isn't going to be happy unless he can keep this angel for himself. Roarke, who is playing a washed up jazz trumpeter Nate Poole, refuses to accept that this heavenly being is going to be stolen from him, and for that matter, neither does Rhys Ifans, who runs the Freak Show Lily (Fox) ran away from.The surprising thing about all this is Fox, who plays Lily with just enough smoldering hurt that all my usual prejudices about her were dispelled. Each character is trying to escape their own rhetorical demons (Poole to free himself from his drug destroyed past, a life devoid of beauty and joy for Happy, and literal cages for Lily) that the noir-ish elements of the film work well. Murray, who can really do malevolence well (he's even better in ""Mad Dog and Glory""), slithers his way through Happy's role with his usual low key smarmy. In his efforts to continue his come-back, Rourke does a decent job as the dazed Poole, even if it just comes off as a lower degree version of ""The Wrestler.""My biggest gripe was that I had the twist figured out by the time Poole finds the side-show. I won't reveal it, naturally, but if I could pluck that particular feather from ""Passion Play,"" my guess is so will a bunch of other viewers. Don't let that stop you from watching this, though.

As a sideshow performer Lily has been traveling with the owner of the show Sam Adamo (Rhys Ifans), but the presence of Nate prompts her to take a step to see the world outside. Cast-against-type Bill Murray also appears as ""Happy"" Shannon, a gangster who is also attracted to the beautiful winged woman.Yes, a winged woman. Megan Fox is Lily with bird-like wings sticking out of her back.

1419602,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B004LYWPZE,Wuchak,"[1, 2]","I know it's hip to slam 2010's ""Passion Play,"" maybe because Megan Fox is an easy target, but the film doesn't deserve it. This is a reverent drama with outlandish aspects and a profound ending.THE PLOT: Nate Poole (Mickey Rourke) is a down-on-his-luck musician in the Southwest who gets on the bad side of a mob boss, Happy (Bill Murray). In his flight he stumbles upon Lily (Fox) at a carnival, a ""freak"" with wings. They discern a deep connection and take off together with Happy & his hoods on their trail.The film is very similar to 2008's ""The Wrestler,"" which also starred Roarke. In both films Rourke plays a languishing has-been. In both films he struggles with his love for a young woman. In ""The Wrestler"" it's his daughter; in ""Passion Play"" it's an exceptional young woman with whom he has a love connection.What surprised me is Fox' acting. She's known for playing the stereotypical hot chick, but here she plays a sweet, innocent woman struggling with an abnormality, and she does it very convincingly.Also, Rourke (Nate) and Fox (Lily) have good chemistry. Yes, Nate is about 30 years older than Lily, but - it doesn't matter - their connection is real, sort of like Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in ""Lost in Translation.""The score is reverent and moving and fits the tone of the film.The ending is both surprising and effective, even though there are obvious clues. See ""COMMENTARY ON ENDING"" below.The film was shot in New Mexico and runs 94 minutes.GRADE: BCOMMENTARY ON THE ENDING (***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read unless you've seen the film): Although some interpret the ending to mean the bulk of the story is Nate's death dream, it more likely indicates that Nate was in some type of purgatorial spiritual realm where God offers a second chance for the lost. Nate passes the test and is ushered into eternal bliss. Since it's some type of spiritual realm where God is sovereign, the reality may be set-up in a holographic sense, similar to Star Trek's Holodeck. In that case, the people Nate experiences aren't real at all; they're there simply as a part of Nate's test.At any rate, the ending gives the story purpose in an eternal scope. Instead of some silly fantasy about a hard-luck musician meeting some ultra-beautiful woman with wings who learns to fly while simultaneously delivering the man from some serious heavies (why sure!), the story becomes a tale of eternal redemption for a languishing dumb bastage who foolishly messed around with a mob boss' wife.At the end you see Nate smiling with true joy as the angel sweeps him off to heavenly bliss.
