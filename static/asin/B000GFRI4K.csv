I am rather surprised that a Western has intrigued me as much as this movie. I liked Open Range but I think I was experiencing more than a Western with Broken Trail, kind of like unveiling the hidden meanings in poetry. Growing up in the ""Black Community,"" we did not watch many westerns, if any, so I asked myself what is so intriguing about this western? I have no conscious relationship to this western. I have watched as little as 5 films more than twice, and I love analyzing and enjoying film since the 1980's. I think Broken Trail speaks to my inner spirituality and the importance of taking journeys.I also think that the historical accuracy of the women most likely being Chinese, allowed me to just enjoy the film and not ask what are these characters doing in this film?! They were very attractive in many ways and because of the language barrier the facial expression and body language made it more interesting. The way #3 was falling in love with (Thomas Hayden Church) without words, was poignant. When she did not get on the stagecoach ride to San Francisco, at the end of the movie,  and just stood there with her hand on her heart crying,..Wow! I almost cried. Again I am from a neighborhood where being macho kept you from an ass-whuppin' and very often hid the sensitivity necessary to be a whole man. We had no connection to the country life, or any knowledge of Black cowboys at the time, so there was no interest in any westerns. I know its the hidden messages of caring for others, persevering through hardships, and the beauty of other cultures, that touched me deeply.

The story is timeless and the characters exceedingly well developed. The dialogue is spare by modern standards and perfect for this story. Robert Duvall proves once again that he is one of America's best character actors. He also carries the lead like the professional that he is. Thomas Haden Church makes you wonder why he is not seen more often in powerful roles. He plays a character that is strong yet understated. I will watch this movie many times.

1003169,A1OTGBG66P6K5Y,B000GFRI4K,"Amazon Customer ""MRD""","[22, 23]","What is it that makes a good Western? Most people who hate Westerns will tell you that they're all the same and, in many cases such is true. Accordingly, I could go on and on about the elements of this movie that are characteristic of all good Westerns. But then I would likely be parroting the excellent points made in most of the previous reviews here.But for the purposes of my review, I choose to talk about the things that make BROKEN TRAIL special.First, the characters and the way they are portrayed is extremely compelling.  I like how Print Ritter, played masterfully by Robert Duvall, is an ""equal-to-life"" hero.  He's not set here as a Western giant, the likes of John Wayne, who can do no wrong and who has complete confidence in everything that he sets his mind to.  Instead, Ritter is a man of doubts, strengths, concerns and confidences who approaches life as any one of us might. He chooses some things right and in other things he fall short. Wonderful ""every man"" mentality. But then this is becoming a refreshingly consistent story for Western characters played by Robert Duvall.Such is also true of Ritter's nephew, Thomas Harte played by Thomas Haden Church. There's friction between Harte and his uncle but then there's an abiding respect that helps form the foundation of one of the finest relationships ever to grace the Western screen. In its own way it's right up there with Gus and Call. Church's deliberate, plodding style creates a confidence in viewers that is nothing short of wonderful. One seems to feel that, come what may, Harte may very well be the last man standing and in the end he doesn't disappoint.And then there's Big Ears Bywater played about as coldly (and wonderfully, I might add) as imaginable by Chris Mulkey. Without expression, even when Ritter defiantly smashes his face with a butt of his head, Big Ears is reminiscent in numerous ways of the demoniacal Blue Duck of LONESOME DOVE fame. He's the sort of villain that keeps the audience wondering whether this is a story that, in the end, goes to the bad guy.  But then I'll leave you to watch and see for yourself.Gwendoline Yeo, Olivia Cheng, Caroline Chan, Jadyn Wong and Valerie Tian are wonderful in their portrayals of five young unfortunate Chinese woman, sold into prostitution and without any apparent hope.  Interestingly, they project an air of vulnerable strength that wins the hearts of Ritter and Harte, as well as the viewer.  No condescension, racism or the pathetic stereotype that might have emerged. You pull for these girls, not because they are helpless, but because their personalities shine clearly through.Add supporting performances by Donald Fong as Lung Hay, Greta Scacchi as Nola, Scott Cooper as Heck Gilpin, James Russo as Captain Billy Fender and Rusty Schwimmer as Big Rump Kate and the spectacular, breathtaking cinematography and what emerges in BROKEN TRAIL is a Western drama that quite easily stands up with some of the best in the genre.THE HORSEMAN",5,A WESTERN THAT EASILY STANDS UP WITH ANY IN THE GENRE,1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,2989,"['What', 'good', 'Western', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'Westerns', 'will', 'tell', ""'re"", 'same', 'many', 'cases', 'such', 'true', 'Accordingly', 'could', 'go', 'elements', 'movie', 'are', 'characteristic', 'good', 'Westerns', 'then', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'parroting', 'excellent', 'points', 'made', 'most', 'previous', 'reviews', 'here.But', 'purposes', 'review', 'choose', 'talk', 'things', 'make', 'BROKEN', 'TRAIL', 'special.First', 'characters', 'way', 'are', 'portrayed', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'how', 'Print', 'Ritter', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'equal-to-life', 'hero', 'not', 'set', 'here', 'Western', 'giant', 'likes', 'John', 'Wayne', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'who', 'complete', 'confidence', 'everything', 'mind', 'Instead', 'Ritter', 'man', 'doubts', 'strengths', 'concerns', 'confidences', 'who', 'approaches', 'life', 'one', 'might', 'things', 'right', 'other', 'things', 'fall', 'short', 'Wonderful', 'man', 'mentality', 'then', 'becoming', 'refreshingly', 'consistent', 'story', 'Western', 'characters', 'played', 'Robert', 'Duvall.Such', 'also', 'true', 'Ritter', 'nephew', 'Thomas', 'Harte', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'friction', 'Harte', 'uncle', 'then', 'abiding', 'respect', 'form', 'foundation', 'one', 'finest', 'relationships', 'ever', 'grace', 'Western', 'screen', 'own', 'way', 'right', 'there', 'Gus', 'Call', 'Church', 'deliberate', 'plodding', 'style', 'confidence', 'viewers', 'nothing', 'short', 'wonderful', 'One', 'feel', 'come', 'what', 'may', 'Harte', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'last', 'man', 'standing', 'end', ""n't"", 'disappoint.And', 'then', 'Big', 'Ears', 'Bywater', 'played', 'about', 'coldly', 'wonderfully', 'might', 'add', 'imaginable', 'Chris', 'Mulkey', 'expression', 'even', 'when', 'Ritter', 'defiantly', 'face', 'butt', 'head', 'Big', 'Ears', 'reminiscent', 'numerous', 'ways', 'demoniacal', 'Blue', 'Duck', 'LONESOME', 'DOVE', 'fame', 'sort', 'villain', 'audience', 'wondering', 'story', 'end', 'bad', 'guy', 'then', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'watch', 'see', 'yourself.Gwendoline', 'Yeo', 'Olivia', 'Cheng', 'Caroline', 'Chan', 'Jadyn', 'Wong', 'Valerie', 'Tian', 'are', 'wonderful', 'portrayals', 'five', 'young', 'unfortunate', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'sold', 'prostitution', 'apparent', 'hope', 'Interestingly', 'project', 'air', 'vulnerable', 'strength', 'hearts', 'Ritter', 'Harte', 'as', 'well', 'viewer', 'condescension', 'racism', 'pathetic', 'stereotype', 'might', 'have', 'emerged', 'pull', 'girls', 'not', 'are', 'helpless', 'personalities', 'shine', 'clearly', 'through.Add', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Donald', 'Fong', 'Lung', 'Hay', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'Nola', 'Scott', 'Cooper', 'Heck', 'Gilpin', 'James', 'Russo', 'Captain', 'Billy', 'Fender', 'Rusty', 'Schwimmer', 'Big', 'Rump', 'Kate', 'spectacular', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'what', 'BROKEN', 'TRAIL', 'Western', 'drama', 'quite', 'easily', 'up', 'best', 'genre.THE', 'HORSEMAN']",N/A

1003177,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,B000GFRI4K,a voice of reason,"[9, 15]","I don't want to knock any Western that's made these days, because there are far too few of them, but as far as Westerns go, this movie is only good. While this is a rather lukewarm endorsement, it is because I believe that the movie could have been much better (though I wish I could give a 3.5-star rating, since I believe 4 stars is too high but 3 stars is a bit low). Too often the movie plods along rather aimlessly and there are too many 21st-century ""I'm o.k., you're o.k."" sensibilities in those slow parts. I enjoy character development in movies, even in Westerns, but much of what passes as such here is of the manipulative, 'tug at your heartstrings' style rather than true character development.The storyline of the Chinese women, who have been sold into prostitution, is one that hasn't been explored before, and it makes the movie interesting. Also, the fact that the women spoke Chinese (there are English subtitles) lends great authenticity to the film. However, in the end, this storyline is not much different from the well-known Western formula of 'good' cowboys rescuing innocents from the 'bad guys'. One thing that puzzled me was that once Prent Ritter (Robert Duvall) and Tom Harte (Thomas Haden Church) found a Chinese man who could serve as a translator for them, they didn't seem to use him to communicate beyond the first day on which they encountered him; he tags along without serving much of a purpose except to give us one of the many aforementioned 'tug at your heartstrings' life stories. Other than serving as a potential love interest for Prent, the Nola Johns (Greta Scacchi) character doesn't add much to the movie either except, you guessed it, to contribute yet another melodramatic tale of hardship on the frontier.Still, there are a lot of good elements to be found in this Western. In the 'making-of' featurette, Duvall says that he sees this film as the third in a trilogy that also consists of ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""Open Range"", and he does make a great cowboy (although his Prent Ritter character here sometimes acts like he might be a bit 'touched in the head'). Thomas Haden Church is a revelation as Tom Harte - he has learned a lot about playing a cowboy since his role as Billy Clanton in ""Tombstone"". He has mastered the art of hardness and stoicism here, while still being the one character in the movie who is truly emotionally vulnerable (as opposed to the bathos that we get from all of the other characters). Haden Church is excellent throughout the movie, and he deservedly gets the lion's share of the action sequences in the film as well.The scenery in the movie is absolutely gorgeous as Alberta, Canada once again stands in for Wyoming in a Western. The problem with the beautiful scenery is that it, unfortunately, contributes to many of the slow scenes in the movie. I think the filmmakers must have spent considerable time oohing and aahing over the beautiful location shots in recent Westerns like ""Open Range"", ""Monte Walsh"", and ""Crossfire Trail"". The latter two movies were also made-for-cable, and I suspect that AMC may have been trying too hard to emulate cable rival TNT's success with those two Westerns. Again, I enjoy the scenery, but sometimes this movie feels like a travelogue without narration rather than a Western; the other movies I mentioned managed to strike just the right balance between scenery, character development, and action (although ""Open Range"" also had some of what I'd call 21st-century 'counseling' scenes, they didn't seem quite as contrived as the ones in ""Broken Trail"").I'll take ""Broken Trail"" over a Westernless movie landscape any day, but I can't rank it up there with the best of the best. The dearth of Westerns in our day makes some people want to call each one that is filmed an instant classic. This movie is enjoyable enough, but when it's over, you'll probably wish you'd only had to spend two hours, rather than three, watching it (the movie is 'only' 184 minutes long, not 240). More judicious editing might have resulted in the movie being a true classic.",3,"A decent Western, but it's too slow and overwrought to be a classic",1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,4070,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'knock', 'Western', 'made', 'days', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'few', 'as', 'far', 'Westerns', 'go', 'movie', 'only', 'good', 'rather', 'lukewarm', 'endorsement', 'believe', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'wish', 'could', 'give', '3.5-star', 'rating', 'believe', '4', 'stars', 'too', 'high', '3', 'stars', 'bit', 'low', 'Too', 'often', 'movie', 'plods', 'rather', 'aimlessly', 'are', 'too', 'many', '21st-century', ""'m"", 'o.k.', ""'re"", 'o.k', 'sensibilities', 'slow', 'parts', 'enjoy', 'character', 'development', 'movies', 'even', 'Westerns', 'much', 'what', 'such', 'here', 'manipulative', 'heartstrings', 'style', 'rather', 'true', 'character', 'development.The', 'storyline', 'Chinese', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'sold', 'prostitution', 'one', ""n't"", 'been', 'explored', 'movie', 'interesting', 'Also', 'fact', 'women', 'spoke', 'Chinese', 'are', 'English', 'subtitles', 'great', 'authenticity', 'film', 'However', 'end', 'storyline', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'well-known', 'Western', 'formula', ""'good"", 'cowboys', 'rescuing', 'innocents', ""'bad"", 'guys', 'One', 'thing', 'puzzled', 'was', 'once', 'Prent', 'Ritter', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Tom', 'Harte', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'found', 'Chinese', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'serve', 'translator', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'use', 'communicate', 'first', 'day', 'encountered', 'along', 'serving', 'much', 'purpose', 'give', 'one', 'many', 'aforementioned', ""'tug"", 'heartstrings', 'life', 'stories', 'Other', 'serving', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'Prent', 'Nola', 'Johns', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'character', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'movie', 'guessed', 'contribute', 'yet', 'melodramatic', 'tale', 'hardship', 'frontier.Still', 'are', 'lot', 'good', 'elements', 'be', 'found', 'Western', ""'making-of"", 'featurette', 'Duvall', 'film', 'third', 'trilogy', 'also', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'Open', 'Range', 'make', 'great', 'cowboy', 'Prent', 'Ritter', 'character', 'here', 'sometimes', 'might', 'be', 'bit', ""'touched"", 'head', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'revelation', 'Tom', 'Harte', 'learned', 'lot', 'playing', 'cowboy', 'role', 'Billy', 'Clanton', 'Tombstone', 'mastered', 'art', 'hardness', 'stoicism', 'here', 'still', 'being', 'one', 'character', 'movie', 'who', 'truly', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'opposed', 'bathos', 'get', 'other', 'characters', 'Haden', 'Church', 'excellent', 'movie', 'deservedly', 'lion', 'share', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'well.The', 'scenery', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'Alberta', 'Canada', 'once', 'again', 'Wyoming', 'Western', 'problem', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'unfortunately', 'contributes', 'many', 'slow', 'scenes', 'movie', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'must', 'have', 'spent', 'considerable', 'time', 'oohing', 'aahing', 'beautiful', 'location', 'shots', 'recent', 'Westerns', 'Open', 'Range', 'Monte', 'Walsh', 'Crossfire', 'Trail', 'latter', 'two', 'movies', 'were', 'also', 'made-for-cable', 'suspect', 'AMC', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'emulate', 'cable', 'rival', 'TNT', 'success', 'two', 'Westerns', 'Again', 'enjoy', 'scenery', 'sometimes', 'movie', 'travelogue', 'narration', 'rather', 'Western', 'other', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'managed', 'strike', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'scenery', 'character', 'development', 'action', 'Open', 'Range', 'also', 'had', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', '21st-century', ""'counseling"", 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'as', 'contrived', 'ones', 'Broken', 'Trail', '.I', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Broken', 'Trail', 'Westernless', 'movie', 'landscape', 'day', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rank', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'best', 'dearth', 'Westerns', 'day', 'people', 'want', 'call', 'one', 'filmed', 'instant', 'classic', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'when', 'over', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'wish', ""'d"", 'only', 'had', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'rather', 'three', 'watching', 'movie', ""'only"", '184', 'minutes', 'long', 'not', '240', 'More', 'judicious', 'editing', 'might', 'have', 'resulted', 'movie', 'being', 'true', 'classic']",N/A

The era was hard, justice could be swift and brutal, and Duvall, as aging but upright Prentice Ritter, lives by his own rules; to protect the helpless in his care, to respect others, and to be unafraid to resort to violence, if necessary. Tom Harte (Church), despite some family history problems with his uncle, lives by the same code, and the two men, driving a herd of horses from Oregon to Wyoming to raise cash for a ranch, become the 'saviors' of five young Chinese women, sold into prostitution, who inadvertently fall into their hands.These are good men, in a jaded world, and their journey picks up other 'strays', as well as the women; young Virginian fiddler Heck Gilpin (an engaging Scott Cooper), is rescued by Tom in a saloon; aging Chinese laborer Lung Hay (Donald Fong), and careworn prostitute Nola John (the wonderful Greta Scacchi) join the group after Tom saves the Chinese women from rapists, in a boarding house/bordello. While neither Ritter and Harte were overjoyed at the strange direction the drive was taking, they would not allow harm to fall on 'innocents', and the group bonds into a warm 'family', with Nola and Ritter finding a mature attraction between each other, and Tom and Sun Foy/#3 (Gwendoline Yeo, who speaks only Mandarin, in the film), gently falling in love.Danger is never far behind them, however, as brutal ex-con 'Big Ears' (Chris Mulkey), with a score to settle with Nola, and a 'contract' to return the Chinese women to whorehouse owner Kate 'Big Rump' Becker (Rusty Schwimmer), trails them, leading a gang of killers...While the film is long (240 minutes), director Walter Hill, an old hand at Westerns (his ""The Long Riders"" is one of my favorites), keeps the story constantly engrossing, and Duvall and Church have a warmth and authenticity as the characters that will stay with you, long after the movie ends.Shot in the Canadian Rockies, ""Broken Trail"" combines grandeur and intimacy seamlessly, has moments of great humor to lighten the drama, explosive action, and a bittersweet sense of nostalgia...It is, simply, superb!",5,"Lyrical, Sweeping Western a Triumph...",1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,2635,"['Broken', 'Trail', 'dream', 'project', 'producer/star', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'AMC', 'first', 'original', 'film', 'spiritual', 'heir', 'Kevin', 'Costner', '2003', 'Open', 'Range', 'also', 'starring', 'Duvall', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'involving', 'Westerns', 'recent', 'years.With', 'charismatic', 'extremely', 'effective', 'performance', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Duvall', 'long-estranged', 'nephew', 'film', 'one', 'only', 'handful', 'Westerns', 'combine', 'epic', 'sweep', 'superb', 'characterization', 'understanding', ""'Real"", 'West', 'shortchanging', 'decency', 'respect', 'individual', 'worth', 'era', 'was', 'hard', 'justice', 'could', 'be', 'swift', 'brutal', 'Duvall', 'aging', 'upright', 'Prentice', 'Ritter', 'own', 'rules', 'protect', 'helpless', 'care', 'respect', 'others', 'be', 'unafraid', 'resort', 'violence', 'necessary', 'Tom', 'Harte', 'Church', 'family', 'history', 'problems', 'uncle', 'lives', 'same', 'code', 'two', 'men', 'driving', 'herd', 'horses', 'Oregon', 'Wyoming', 'raise', 'cash', 'ranch', 'become', ""'saviors"", 'five', 'young', 'Chinese', 'women', 'sold', 'prostitution', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'fall', 'hands.These', 'are', 'good', 'men', 'jaded', 'world', 'journey', 'up', 'other', ""'strays"", 'as', 'well', 'women', 'young', 'Virginian', 'fiddler', 'Heck', 'Gilpin', 'engaging', 'Scott', 'Cooper', 'rescued', 'Tom', 'saloon', 'aging', 'Chinese', 'laborer', 'Lung', 'Hay', 'Donald', 'Fong', 'careworn', 'prostitute', 'Nola', 'John', 'wonderful', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'join', 'group', 'Tom', 'Chinese', 'women', 'rapists', 'boarding', 'house/bordello', 'Ritter', 'Harte', 'were', 'overjoyed', 'strange', 'direction', 'drive', 'was', 'taking', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'harm', 'fall', ""'innocents"", 'group', 'bonds', 'warm', ""'family"", 'Nola', 'Ritter', 'finding', 'mature', 'attraction', 'other', 'Tom', 'Sun', 'Foy/', '3', 'Gwendoline', 'Yeo', 'who', 'only', 'Mandarin', 'film', 'gently', 'falling', 'love.Danger', 'never', 'far', 'however', 'brutal', 'ex-con', ""'Big"", 'Ears', 'Chris', 'Mulkey', 'score', 'settle', 'Nola', ""'contract"", 'return', 'Chinese', 'women', 'whorehouse', 'owner', 'Kate', ""'Big"", 'Rump', 'Becker', 'Rusty', 'Schwimmer', 'leading', 'gang', 'killers', 'film', 'long', '240', 'minutes', 'director', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'old', 'hand', 'Westerns', 'Long', 'Riders', 'one', 'favorites', 'story', 'constantly', 'engrossing', 'Duvall', 'Church', 'have', 'warmth', 'authenticity', 'characters', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'movie', 'ends.Shot', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'Broken', 'Trail', 'combines', 'grandeur', 'intimacy', 'seamlessly', 'moments', 'great', 'humor', 'lighten', 'drama', 'explosive', 'action', 'bittersweet', 'sense', 'nostalgia', 'simply', 'superb']",N/A

My point being that although this is not on the level with Lonesome Dove or Dances with Wolves, I wish there was more TV like this (Yes, I realize Lonesome Dove was a TV mini-series as well).Like a few others have said, this is a good movie, but do not expect Lonesome Dove. I guess it is unfair because I couldn't watch this movie without Lonesome Dove in my mind the whole time. There are many scenes, characters and themes reminiscent of Lonesome Dove, including the pervading melancholy mood, and although the scenery is beautiful and the film quality is better, it just doesn't have the same impact.There are some scenes, some long and boring scenes, that I assume were intended to give some depth and character to the movie, but they had me on the verge of hitting the DVD fast-forward button. Just too slow and boring. These are few, however, and in the end they are only a minor distraction.I guess I'm biased, Robert Duvall is unquestionably one of the, if not THE, great actors of our time, and has played some fascinating characters, but to me he will always be Augustus McCrae. It is impossible for me to watch him in a western, including Open Range, and not think of ol' Gus and look for Woodrow Call to to ride up. Impossible.This is a good movie. There is good old fashioned frontier justice, what's right is right, life on the trail, beautiful scenery and cinematography, nice acting, a good story, and Robert Duvall.

It included what appears to be a real horse being trampled to death, a rape scene and other basic violence. I am sure this would receive an ""R"" rating from MPAA.At the beginning of the film, the Chinese girls (who actually are the best part of the entire movie) are inspected for their virginity. This of course has some nudity and other quick uncomfortable shots. The only thing that would have made it more gratuitous would have been a copycat scene from Basic Instinct. Ok I can get past that but clearly I would not let younger family members see this. The one scene I could not believe actually made the final cut is the running of the horses. As masses of horses are running toward the camera on the right you can see a horse turn upside down and get obviously trampled, I am assuming to its death. I was incredulous that a scene like that would be left for viewers. Any director would have to know that would color someone's opinion from then on. Obviously SPCA didn't certify that no animals were hurt during the making of this movie. I am sure the scene where horses fall and are killed showed even less mercy for the animals. I just cringe thinking of how many were injured during the production of this saga.Other scenes were disjointed. How Ritter knew that that the two men were carring diseases when they tried to cross the trail is beyond me. It would have made a great dropping on the editing floor. The rape scene is another great selection for droppings.If you are considering buying this, do not expect it to be a family western and do not expect to feel good afterward. This film lacked class and was NOT tastefully done. I got the feeling that only men influenced the production of this and I regret spending the money on a film that made money off of the poor treatment of horses. Instead of being an artfully done feel good western, this saga left me with a sick feeling in the middle of my stomach. At the end of the story, I really didn't care that a scroll of what happend to the characters rolled by.

This one, a TV miniseries, is just great. I can't say enough good things about it. I saw it recently on DVD. It was a three-hour film. I thought I read somewhere that it was four hours, so I don't know if this version has been cut down. I only know what I saw, and I liked about everything I saw.I also knew what to expect.....and that helped. I didn't expect a rough film with a ton of violence and nasty characters, language, etc. What surprised me was just how interesting a film this was for being three hours long and not having a lot of action. I attribute this to the dialog, the acting, characters you care about and the wonderful cinematography. It's hard to beat the scenery in a nicely-filmed western.The words coming out of the two stars of the picture, Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church were extremely believable material. These guys were tough, but not abrasively- macho, compassionate but not sappy. As ""Prentice Ritter"" and ""Tom Harte,"" respectively, they fascinating to watch. I liked what they said throughout the movie and they were extremely believable characters. They looked and talked the part.This story is different because it's mainly about helping five young Chinese women, who are destined for prostitution, slavery and who knows what else. Ritter and Harte didn't volunteer for the job; it accidentally came upon them as they were escorting horses North for a nice payday. The two men showed wonderful compassion for these girls, despite the fact they slowed their mission down and had a problem with communication.It simple terms: this is a nice movie, a good story about good guys doing a good deed for the right reasons. Watching them do it, under adverse conditions, was almost a privilege.

1003217,A348820ZNKKYPI,B000GFRI4K,D. Lively,"[1, 5]","However, I do have a couple of nits to pick and I will get them out of the way first.One, why in heaven's name did they set the story in 1897?  The West was tamed by then.  Almost nothing that happened fit into that time frame, from a trail drive of that magnitude (700 miles) to the raw mining town to the indians on the ""warpath"" to the encounter with ""Smallpox Bob.""  If they had set it in 1882 or even 1889, they would have been safe.  I can't help but think that someone slipped up on the research, really.Two, I love Robert Duvall, but I am getting a tad bored with his patented ""Agustus McCrea"" impersonation.  I realize that in order to get this project backed he probably did have to promise to reprise his most popular character type.  But couldn't he have given us one or two surprises this time?  Maybe stretch the character a bit?  For instance, why not have let Uncle Print actually take a chance on a real relationship with Nola Jones?  Greta Scacchi gave such a touching and lovely performance one did feel that her character deserved better.That said, any discontent I may have with the movie is more than made up for by the revelation of Thomas Hadden Church, solid and stunning as an action hero of the best kind.  The almost wordless romance between his character and the character of Sun Yu is completely convincing and totally satisfying.  Oh, and the young woman playing Sun Yu is no slouch in the acting department either.I also give the production team points for examining the plight of the young Chinese women and of women in general in the West before it was tamed.  Unfortunately, that would have been several years earlier than 1897.  Rats!

1003218,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B000GFRI4K,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","I tell ya, Robert Duvall can just climb on a horse (rather tenderly these days, mind you) and you've suddenly got an outstanding Western.  And the AMC cable channel is very well known for its groundbreaking television.  Combine the two, and the happy result is BROKEN TRAIL, a movie with the central, tried-and-true theme that blood is thicker than water, as an aging rancher (Duvall, playing crusty old Print Ritter) and his estranged, moody nephew (Thomas Haden Church as Tom Harte) drive a herd of horses from Oregon to Wyoming (meaning prepare yourself for some breathtaking vistas).  Along the way, they seem to attract plenty of strays, from an adventure-seeking Virginian, to five Chinese girls in constant peril, to a solemn Chinaman, to one soiled dove with a heart of gold.  Also along the way, the two men connect, bond--and not just with each other.One aspect that did (somewhat) disappoint me is the incontrovertible fact Duvall does, basically, reprise his most famous role; in short, his Ritter isAugustus McCrae, some twenty years later.  The mannerisms, the delivery, the wit and humor, the gritty determination--this is McCrae all over again.  Which isn't a negative in its own light, as I cherish that character, but I was disappointed that Duvall doesn't bring anything new to this most interesting role.  As for his counterpart, Church is more than solid as the brooding nephew who learns a thing or two about his family, his background, his uncle--even falling in love.The rest of the cast is stellar, including Scott Cooper as the happy-go-lucky Virginian, a menacing Chris Mulkey playing villain Big Ears, Rusty Schwimmer as a shrill, petulant madam (properly named Big Rump Kate), and Greta Scacchi as the ex-prostitute who discovers she harbors more than platonic feelings for Ritter.  The five Chinese young ladies are all exquisitely beautiful, headlined by Gwendoline Yeo as Number 3 (to remember them, Ritter gives each of them a number), who becomes Harte's love interest, and who easily delivers the film's most poignant, compelling scene towards the end.  At four hours, BROKEN TRAIL does at times bog down and meander, but for the most part this is a Western with an authentic look and feel, tender yet harsh, tragic and humorous.  Well worth pulling up a rocking chair.--D.

And I have written before on one of the entries in Robert Duvall&iexcl;s Trilogy (Open Range). His Trilogy includes Lonesome Dove, Broken Trail and Open Range. I return with a review of a second movie from that Trilogy: Broken Trail.This is a superb movie.1. It is a story of ugliness (the sale of five teen age Chinese girls to a madam at a mining camp in Idaho).2. It is a picture of the incredible natural beauty (a herd of many horses on the range in the Canadian Rockies C simulating the mountains in Oregon, Idaho and Montana).3. It is the story of Print Ritter (Robert Duvall) and his nephew Tom Harte (Thomas Haden Church)   planning to move500 horses to Montana for sale to an agent of the British Government.4. More ugliness emerges as the &iexcl;slaver&iexcl;, who has been hired to move these girls, runs into Ritter, Harte and the horses. They agree to join up, but this &iexcl;slaver&iexcl; secretly dopes some wine he has brought along. He steals there money and one of the girls and takes off, and soon rapes this child.. Ultimately Ritter and Harte wake up, and Harte decides to pursue this &iexcl;slaver.&iexcl; When he catches up, he gets the jump on him and soon hangs him. A bit later, this girl essentially commits suicide by falling out of their wagon into the path of several rapidly moving horses. Even later another girl comes down with a fever and soon passes away too.5. Still more ugliness emerges as they head north. Ritter seeks a town, with some &iexcl;civil authority&iexcl;, where he can turn in the girls. The town he picks turns out to be the worst one possible, as it is the site of the mining camp and the home of the madam &iexcl;Big Rump Kate.&iexcl; Harte and another member of their group barely escape, but pick up two other victims: a large middle aged Chinaman, Lung Hay (Donald Fong) and a small, and still pretty women in her thirties, Mrs Nola Johns (Greta Scacchi), who had been forced into prostitution when her husband died.6. It is a picture of the incredible human beauty as Harte ultimately falls in love with the oldest Chinese gal, Sun Foy (Gwendoline Yeo) and Nola with Print Ritter. He is very fond of Nola, but sees himself as too old, but when they both are &iexcl;gone&iexcl; they are buried side by side.7. There is still more ugliness in this movie near the end, but Ritter and Harte survive, and their horse venture turns out to be a huge success.

He takes along his nephew played by Thomas Haden Church.  Early on they come across a slave trader with young Chinese women and girls being taken to a mining camp.  They run into a bad man who is real life (not some comic book character like some of the old westerns) and the story gets more interesting as it proceeds to a natural western like climax.

Producer) said he considers this the third part of his personal western trilogy (Lonesome Dove 1 & 2 being the first parts)... but the story here, and his character is different. (I didn't care for Lonesome Dove, BTW, it was too hard-hearted for me.)Like most great westerns the real battle here is between corruption and ethics, even if they are wild west ethics. Duval and Church give 100% perfect performances, but Gwendolyn Yeo as the sweet strong mother figure for the Chinese girls is the heart of this piece, and she gives us brilliant moments of heart wrenching confusion, relief and joy. It is her smile which brightens this dark tale, this, and the Director's vision that true goodness does actually exist, and has strength and power. That mindset is what makes any western great.In the traditional trail drive, non verbal male atmosphere, we have 5 kidnapped Chinese women ( rightfully not dubbed, so seemingly non-verbal as well) and this mix lifts the story far above the ordinary.Greta Scacchi - looking beautifully her age - later comes in as a woman whose life has let her slip far downhill, and we have a truly great, restrained, mature, romantic scene between Duvall and Scacchi.Through all of this is really beautiful and majestic cinematography, used to to it's best to highlight and magnify the whole story. Even in a genre known for landscape, this one is near the top for scenes of raw, expansive, natural beauty.

Very impressed for a 2-part TV mini-series... Both Robert Duvall & Thomas Haden Church really seemed into their roles and bought a believability to their characters of two (rare) decent humanitarian frontiersmen (Uncle & Nephew), who still aren't perfect, and (as a result of their lives on the frontier) are still prepared to kill when there is no other option. Set at the very end of the Old West era (1898 - typically the massacre at Wounded Knee in 1890 is often considered the official end of the Old West as it was the end of the plains wars with the Native American Indians, but some areas remained unchanged right into the 20th Century), it starts in Oregon and heads north & east through the last untamed area of America at the time and eventually into Wyoming, as Duvall & Haden Church drive a herd of horses to market to make their stake money to buy ranches/land and start new lives...This is a good solid western, with a strong humanitarian story, and a reasonable amount of harshness and bad luck as well. Duvall & Haden Church face numerous challenges, ethical dilemmas, and life threatening dangers during their journey and for a TV Mini-Series I think this is presented very well and keeps the story moving from one event to another without being unduly hasty... There is also some excellent (dare I say sumptuous) scenes of, well, scenery! The Blu-ray image quality seems very good, and several scenes made me want to start planning a trip to the US just to go up to the North West & Canada to see it for real (most of the movie is filmed in Canada I believe).Highly recommended for anyone who is a Western Fan or such like...

1003271,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B000GFRI4K,"kone ""kone""","[70, 77]","Wow!  This is why filmmakers make movies.  This movie will capture your imagination and heart.  It is a big epic of a western, beautifuly filmed, with an intriging story line that will keep you guessing right up until the very end.I am a devoted western movie fan, and this movie ranks up there with the very best of the genre.Robert Duvall, best known as ""Agustus"" in Lonesome Dove, dons western garb once again and stars in a lengthy, yet thoroughly enjoyable tale of a horse drive across the plains to Sheridan, Wyoming.  Duvall employs his nephew in the endevor, and they unexpectedly meet up with a variety of both endearing and unsavory characters along the way.This is not a shoot 'em up western. It is not action-packed.  It meanders at a leisurly pace, as an actual horse drive would, yet an enjoyable pace from beginning to end.  Duvall, as the patriarch Print Ritter, and his nephew Tom Harte, (played exceedingly strongly by Thomas Church) take about 500 head of horses to Wyoming.  On the trail, they cross trails with an evil pimp who is moving five Chinese girls to a mining camp where they will be sold into the living hell of prostitution.  The Chinese are sweet innocent beings who are being mistreated by the pimp, and through a series of incidents, the girls become the responsibility of Ritter and Harte.  From there, the group picks up additional characters: another trail hand, an aging abused prostitute, Nola, played wonderfully by Greta Scacchi(who becomes a potential love interest of Duvall), and a Chinese man.  This western is unusual in that the men portrayed have an inate sense of honor, and they treat their ""guests"" with dignity and kindness, which is unusual treatment indeed.  The men vow to protect their companions until they can be safely dropped off in a town where they will be protected and not abused.On the trail we are treated to the troup interacting with each other.  Nola falls in love with Duvall's character, as she senses the goodness inside him.  She has never been treated with respect or kindness, and she sees a future with Duvall that would be romantic and tender in their love for each other.  Meanwhile, nephew Tom has his shy eye on one of the Chinese girls, and they form a tentative, but budding relationship along the way.  Throughout the trail drive, the viewer wonders how the love interests will play out.As with any good western, there is a chief antagonist, and in this case, he is a former customer of Nola's, ""Big Ed"", who is obsessed with her, yet absues her, and in the past nearly killed her.  He is paid to bring the Chinese girls to the mining town, and like any evil man, he surrounds himself with three other equally evil companions to accomplish the job.  Plans are made to overcome Duvall and his group, take the Chinese girls, and steal the horse herd.The climax occurs at the very end of the film, so it keeps you guessing right up until the very last minute.  I will not spoil the ending here, yet suffice to say that the ending is tension-filled, action-packed, and beautifully directed for maximum suspense and impact.Robert Duvall is magnificent.  He is the quintessential cowboy, a role that he was born to play.  His easy mannerisms and style of acting rank an A+ in my book.  Thomas Church plays a powerful role as well, as the chief protector of the group.  He is as physically hard as Duvall is tender-hearted, and the two make a fine contrast.  All the actors portray their roles wonderfully and most believably.  It is as though you are along for the ride, watching it all unfold.  One is not aware that these are actors playing roles, no, these are reallife characters, and that is what draws you into this 4-hour movie, and keeps your interest.This is a movie that is not suitable for young children due to gun violence and a brief rape scene.  It is however, a movie that both men and women will enjoy together, for the male-female relationship is continually explored throughout the movie.  Most westerns do not appeal to women, but this one is different, as much of the movie is interpreted through female eyes.In conclusion, this is a great western that is worth every minute of the 4-our time span.  It will engage you and show a side of the west that no other film has attempted.  Highly recommended without reservations.  Find a nice easy chair, sit back, and enjoy this beautifully-made film.Jim 'Konedog"" Koenig",5,A Romantic Yet Gritty Western - Top Notch!,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,4414,"['Wow', 'why', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'movies', 'movie', 'will', 'capture', 'imagination', 'heart', 'big', 'epic', 'western', 'beautifuly', 'filmed', 'intriging', 'story', 'line', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'right', 'up', 'very', 'end.I', 'am', 'devoted', 'western', 'movie', 'fan', 'movie', 'up', 'there', 'very', 'best', 'genre.Robert', 'Duvall', 'best', 'known', 'Agustus', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'western', 'garb', 'once', 'again', 'stars', 'lengthy', 'yet', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'tale', 'horse', 'drive', 'plains', 'Sheridan', 'Wyoming', 'Duvall', 'nephew', 'endevor', 'unexpectedly', 'meet', 'up', 'variety', 'endearing', 'unsavory', 'characters', 'way.This', 'not', 'shoot', 'up', 'western', 'not', 'action-packed', 'leisurly', 'pace', 'actual', 'horse', 'drive', 'would', 'yet', 'enjoyable', 'pace', 'beginning', 'end', 'Duvall', 'patriarch', 'Print', 'Ritter', 'nephew', 'Tom', 'Harte', 'played', 'exceedingly', 'strongly', 'Thomas', 'Church', 'take', '500', 'head', 'horses', 'Wyoming', 'trail', 'cross', 'trails', 'evil', 'pimp', 'who', 'moving', 'five', 'Chinese', 'girls', 'mining', 'camp', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'sold', 'living', 'hell', 'prostitution', 'Chinese', 'are', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'beings', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'mistreated', 'pimp', 'series', 'incidents', 'girls', 'become', 'responsibility', 'Ritter', 'Harte', 'there', 'group', 'up', 'additional', 'characters', 'trail', 'hand', 'aging', 'abused', 'prostitute', 'Nola', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'who', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'Duvall', 'Chinese', 'man', 'western', 'unusual', 'men', 'portrayed', 'have', 'inate', 'sense', 'honor', 'treat', 'guests', 'dignity', 'kindness', 'unusual', 'treatment', 'indeed', 'men', 'vow', 'protect', 'companions', 'can', 'be', 'safely', 'dropped', 'off', 'town', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'protected', 'not', 'abused.On', 'trail', 'are', 'treated', 'troup', 'interacting', 'other', 'Nola', 'love', 'Duvall', 'character', 'goodness', 'never', 'been', 'treated', 'respect', 'kindness', 'future', 'Duvall', 'would', 'be', 'romantic', 'tender', 'love', 'other', 'Meanwhile', 'nephew', 'Tom', 'shy', 'eye', 'one', 'Chinese', 'girls', 'form', 'tentative', 'budding', 'relationship', 'way', 'trail', 'drive', 'viewer', 'how', 'love', 'interests', 'will', 'play', 'out.As', 'good', 'western', 'chief', 'antagonist', 'case', 'former', 'customer', 'Nola', 'Big', 'Ed', 'who', 'obsessed', 'yet', 'past', 'nearly', 'killed', 'paid', 'bring', 'Chinese', 'girls', 'mining', 'town', 'evil', 'man', 'three', 'other', 'equally', 'evil', 'companions', 'accomplish', 'job', 'Plans', 'are', 'made', 'overcome', 'Duvall', 'group', 'take', 'Chinese', 'girls', 'steal', 'horse', 'herd.The', 'climax', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'guessing', 'right', 'up', 'very', 'last', 'minute', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'ending', 'here', 'yet', 'suffice', 'say', 'ending', 'tension-filled', 'action-packed', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'maximum', 'suspense', 'impact.Robert', 'Duvall', 'magnificent', 'quintessential', 'cowboy', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'easy', 'mannerisms', 'style', 'acting', 'rank', 'A+', 'book', 'Thomas', 'Church', 'powerful', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'chief', 'protector', 'group', 'physically', 'hard', 'Duvall', 'tender-hearted', 'two', 'make', 'fine', 'contrast', 'actors', 'portray', 'roles', 'wonderfully', 'most', 'believably', 'are', 'along', 'ride', 'watching', 'unfold', 'One', 'not', 'aware', 'are', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'are', 'reallife', 'characters', 'what', '4-hour', 'movie', 'interest.This', 'movie', 'not', 'suitable', 'young', 'children', 'due', 'gun', 'violence', 'brief', 'rape', 'scene', 'however', 'movie', 'men', 'women', 'will', 'enjoy', 'together', 'male-female', 'relationship', 'continually', 'explored', 'movie', 'Most', 'westerns', 'do', 'not', 'appeal', 'women', 'one', 'different', 'much', 'movie', 'interpreted', 'female', 'eyes.In', 'conclusion', 'great', 'western', 'worth', 'minute', '4-our', 'time', 'span', 'will', 'engage', 'show', 'side', 'west', 'other', 'film', 'attempted', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'reservations', 'Find', 'nice', 'easy', 'chair', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'beautifully-made', 'film.Jim', ""'Konedog"", 'Koenig']",N/A
1003272,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000GFRI4K,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 5]","I wonder how much more we would be impressed by ""Broken Trail"" if it were not for ""Lonesome Dove.""  I was surprised to realize it had been 18 years since Robert Duvall played Gus McCrae, in what I think is still the finest acting portrayal of his distinguished career.  But we are talking about one of the great westerns of all time and an epic television mini-series, which I usually watch again each year.  So the parallels between ""Lonesome Dove"" and this 2006 two-part television movie (I maintain you need at least three parts to be a true mini-series) became a big distracting because they keep intruding on what is happening here.  Obviously the fact that Duvall is in both stands out, but we also have a narrative defined by a trail drive, bad guys along the way, and a hooker with the heart of gold, along against the spectacular landscape of fading days of the Old West.  When I was thinking how much Greta Scacchi looked like Diane Lane,Prentice Ritter (Duval), shows up to tell his estranged nephew Tom Harte (Thomas Hayden Church) that his mother has died and left everything to her brother instead of her son.  Prentice proposes taking several hundred horses from Oregon to Wyoming in the year 1897.  But on the trail they come across Captain Billy Fender (James Russo), a lowlife who is transporting five young Chinese girls to a brothel in a mining town.  Well, that is just wrong, and Captain Billy makes it easy for Ritter and Harte to kill him and take the girls with them on their journey.  Ritter gives the girls numbers rather than names, but they are Sun Fu (Gwendoline Yeo), Mai Ling (Caroline Chan), Ye Fung (Olivia Cheng), Gina Wa (Valerie Tian), and Ghee Moon (Jadyn Wong).  What started out as two men on the trail ends up as a party of ten as they pick up a fiddle player from Virginia named Heck Gilpin (Scott Cooper), a Chinese man who came to America to make his fortune (Lung Hay), and a prostitute named Nola (Sacchi).  Meanwhile, the brothel owner Big Rump Kate (Rusty Schwimmer), who has paid for the girls, sends Big Ears (Chris Mulkey), just released from prison, after the girls and the cowboys protecting them.Duvall and Sacchi turn in the solid performances you would expect, and have a very nice scene together, but is Church who is most clearly carving out something new in terms of what we expect from him as an actor as he tries to be even more minimalist than Duvall.  I was having trouble with the idea of Church playing the Sandman in ""Spider-Man 3"" next summer, but after seeing what his character does to a man who likes to spoil little girls, that is no longer a concern.  The story and script by Alan Geoffrion might be echoing ""Lonesome Dove"" too much, but I liked how the language barrier between the cowboys and the Chinese girls was not magically solved and how they overcame it.  Besides, there is something to be said for been privy to a side of the story that the characters who only speak English know nothing about.Ultimately I rounded down on this one because in terms of setting up the final confrontation each side makes a fatal mistake.  I know the bad guys are not as smart as the good guys, but I do like to put a limit on their stupidity, and I thought Harte had exhibited enough of sense of frontier justice to overcome any mistakes Ritter might make along the way.  Still this is quite enjoyable and while it is painfully clear that ""Lonesome Dove,"" ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Unforgiven"" have failed to revive the Western genre, at least it is equally obvious that when one gets made these days it is probably pretty good.  Even if ""Broken Trail"" is not quite on the same level as these others, it is certainly worth watching, but we knew that as soon as we saw that Duvall and Walter Hill were attached to the production.Duvall considers ""Broken Trail"" to complete a trilogy of sorts with ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""Open Range,"" which may be a way of saying that he now feels no further need to make westerns.  Although at Duvall's present age John Wayne was still going to make ""Big Jake,"" ""The Cowboys,"" and, of course, ""The Shootist,"" but admittedly Wayne was making a different type of Western than Duvall.  Still, I would hate to think that Duvall has washed his hands of the genre.  Hill and Duvall had worked together on ""Geronimo: An American Legend,"" and Hill has also directed by Westerns ""The Long Riders"" and ""Wild Bill,"" as well as an episode of ""Deadwood.""  So his bona fides are equally strong in this regard.  All things considered, AMC has to be pleased enough with this project to tackle another, although I suspect it will be in a different genre.",4,"Robert Duvall tries to recapture the ""Lonesome Dove"" magic in this AMC movie",1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,4631,"['wonder', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'impressed', 'Broken', 'Trail', 'were', 'not', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'was', 'surprised', 'realize', 'had', 'been', '18', 'years', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'played', 'Gus', 'McCrae', 'what', 'think', 'still', 'finest', 'acting', 'portrayal', 'distinguished', 'career', 'are', 'talking', 'one', 'great', 'westerns', 'time', 'epic', 'television', 'mini-series', 'usually', 'watch', 'again', 'year', 'parallels', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', '2006', 'two-part', 'television', 'movie', 'maintain', 'need', 'least', 'three', 'parts', 'be', 'true', 'mini-series', 'became', 'big', 'distracting', 'keep', 'intruding', 'what', 'happening', 'here', 'Obviously', 'fact', 'Duvall', 'stands', 'out', 'also', 'have', 'narrative', 'defined', 'trail', 'drive', 'bad', 'guys', 'way', 'hooker', 'heart', 'gold', 'spectacular', 'landscape', 'fading', 'days', 'Old', 'West', 'When', 'was', 'thinking', 'how', 'much', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'looked', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Prentice', 'Ritter', 'Duval', 'up', 'tell', 'estranged', 'nephew', 'Tom', 'Harte', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'mother', 'died', 'left', 'everything', 'brother', 'instead', 'son', 'Prentice', 'taking', 'several', 'hundred', 'horses', 'Oregon', 'Wyoming', 'year', '1897', 'trail', 'come', 'Captain', 'Billy', 'Fender', 'James', 'Russo', 'lowlife', 'who', 'transporting', 'five', 'young', 'Chinese', 'girls', 'brothel', 'mining', 'town', 'Well', 'just', 'wrong', 'Captain', 'Billy', 'easy', 'Ritter', 'Harte', 'kill', 'take', 'girls', 'journey', 'Ritter', 'girls', 'numbers', 'rather', 'names', 'are', 'Sun', 'Fu', 'Gwendoline', 'Yeo', 'Mai', 'Ling', 'Caroline', 'Chan', 'Ye', 'Fung', 'Olivia', 'Cheng', 'Gina', 'Wa', 'Valerie', 'Tian', 'Ghee', 'Moon', 'Jadyn', 'Wong', 'What', 'started', 'out', 'two', 'men', 'trail', 'up', 'party', 'ten', 'pick', 'up', 'fiddle', 'player', 'Virginia', 'named', 'Heck', 'Gilpin', 'Scott', 'Cooper', 'Chinese', 'man', 'who', 'came', 'America', 'make', 'fortune', 'Lung', 'Hay', 'prostitute', 'named', 'Nola', 'Sacchi', 'Meanwhile', 'brothel', 'owner', 'Big', 'Rump', 'Kate', 'Rusty', 'Schwimmer', 'who', 'paid', 'girls', 'Big', 'Ears', 'Chris', 'Mulkey', 'just', 'released', 'prison', 'girls', 'cowboys', 'protecting', 'them.Duvall', 'Sacchi', 'turn', 'solid', 'performances', 'would', 'expect', 'have', 'very', 'nice', 'scene', 'together', 'Church', 'who', 'most', 'clearly', 'carving', 'out', 'something', 'new', 'terms', 'what', 'expect', 'actor', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'minimalist', 'Duvall', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'idea', 'Church', 'playing', 'Sandman', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'next', 'summer', 'seeing', 'what', 'character', 'man', 'who', 'spoil', 'little', 'girls', 'no', 'longer', 'concern', 'story', 'script', 'Alan', 'Geoffrion', 'might', 'be', 'echoing', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'too', 'much', 'liked', 'how', 'language', 'barrier', 'cowboys', 'Chinese', 'girls', 'was', 'not', 'magically', 'solved', 'how', 'overcame', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'been', 'privy', 'side', 'story', 'characters', 'who', 'only', 'speak', 'English', 'know', 'nothing', 'about.Ultimately', 'rounded', 'down', 'one', 'terms', 'setting', 'up', 'final', 'confrontation', 'side', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'know', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'smart', 'good', 'guys', 'do', 'put', 'limit', 'stupidity', 'thought', 'Harte', 'had', 'exhibited', 'enough', 'sense', 'frontier', 'justice', 'overcome', 'mistakes', 'Ritter', 'might', 'make', 'way', 'Still', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'painfully', 'clear', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Unforgiven', 'have', 'failed', 'revive', 'Western', 'genre', 'least', 'equally', 'obvious', 'when', 'one', 'made', 'days', 'probably', 'pretty', 'good', 'Even', 'Broken', 'Trail', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'level', 'others', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'knew', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'Duvall', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'were', 'attached', 'production.Duvall', 'Broken', 'Trail', 'complete', 'trilogy', 'sorts', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'Open', 'Range', 'may', 'be', 'way', 'saying', 'now', 'further', 'need', 'make', 'westerns', 'Duvall', 'present', 'age', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'make', 'Big', 'Jake', 'Cowboys', 'course', 'Shootist', 'admittedly', 'Wayne', 'was', 'making', 'different', 'type', 'Western', 'Duvall', 'Still', 'would', 'hate', 'think', 'Duvall', 'washed', 'hands', 'genre', 'Hill', 'Duvall', 'had', 'worked', 'together', 'Geronimo', 'American', 'Legend', 'Hill', 'also', 'directed', 'Westerns', 'Long', 'Riders', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'as', 'well', 'episode', 'Deadwood', 'bona', 'fides', 'are', 'equally', 'strong', 'regard', 'things', 'considered', 'AMC', 'be', 'pleased', 'enough', 'project', 'tackle', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'genre']",N/A

I knew I was going to watch this western as soon as I read that Robert Duvall was involved in the project.This movie takes place during the late 1800s. It starts with two horse wranglers played by Duvall and Church. Duvall's character, Print Ritter, is Church's uncle. They decide too wrangle horses and sell them to the British Empire who needed them for the Boer War. In the movie we follow this magnificent heard of horses as they are driven east across beautiful country. During the drive they run into five Chinese women who were being kidnapped from the West Coast and brought to the interior west to serve as prostitutes. The story of our horse drive and the story of five Chinese women become intertwined.What makes this western special is we see the personal growth of Print Ritter from lonesome cowboy to father figure. And what makes this western unique is we see the story from the view of the female characters.

It's not the typical conflict of western epics, but good enough to set the story in motion and bring it to an odd but worthy conclusion.  Thomas Haden Church as the rejected son is the real surprise in Broken Trail.  While his character is low key, the honesty and humor Church delivers is far from it.  In every scene he persuasively portrays a man who responds to his situation with quiet strength and pragmatic acceptance of the outcome.Beyond stellar performances, the film offers great production which includes beautiful scenery and attention to detail.  There are moments when the story seems to noticably slow down, but this strikes me as purposeful.

That was true of ""Tender Mercies,"" ""Lonesome Dove,"" and ""Open Range,"" and it's also true of ""Broken Trail,"" Walter Hill's mesmerizing, exquisitely photographed Western miniseries about a couple of cowboys--uncle and nephew--who come to the rescue of five Chinese girls who were sold into prostitution. Duvall's Print Ritter can't help but remind you of ""Lonesome Dove's"" Gus McCrae or ""Open Range's"" Boss Spearman, but at the same time Print is very different from Gus or Boss in subtle ways that only a master actor such as Duvall can make clear. ""Broken Trail"" is magnificently acted throughout. Thomas Haden Church forgoes his usual goofy persona as Print's nephew Tom Harte, in a thoroughly convincing portrayal of a brave, sad cowboy, downtrodden by life yet beholden to no one. Chris Mulkey--bearing more than a passing resemblance to the late Howard Duff--is properly loathsome as the outlaw ""Big Ear"" Ed Bywaters, and Greta Scacchi is deeply moving as Nola, a hard-luck woman menaced by Bywaters and enamored of Print. Viewers might complain that the young Chinese women don't becomne very individualized, but--given the movie's realism in showing that the girls can't speak English or comprehend Wild West culture--that was probably inevitable. Alan Geoffrion--who also wrote the original novel of ""Open Range""--provides a screenplay that isn't all happily-ever-after, but is satisfyingly poignant and filled with rich dialogue and characterizations.

However, Broken Trail should not be considered as an also-ran, coasting in the coattails of its obvious and considerable predecessor.  It certainly does owe much to Lonesome Dove, as the two men seek to herd 500 horses across the country to earn enough money to own their own land, all the while learning more about themselves and each other along the way.  However, this certainly has enough of its own style with Walter Hill back on great form (welcome back, Walter, it's been a while...), and the two leads Duvall and Thomas Hayden Church simply outstanding, to make this solid, entertaining, educational and moving in it's own right.The twist in this movie, is that along the way, they take in 5 innocent but abused Chinese women who have been at the mercy of a low life trafficker (yes, it's actually a chattel drive), thus reflecting the actual historical problem of the time, whereby Chinese daughters were sold into slavery and prostitution in the US.  Their new wards bring the two upright but gritty men into contact with horse thieves, gunslingers, brothel keepers and even the proverbial hooker with a heart of gold as their horse drive becomes altogether more dangerous and eventful than they had anticipated.  And yet, while including all these mores of the genre the movie has such an intenseness and realism, that the characters never feel like story conveniences or clich&eacute;s. Hill directed the pilot episode of Deadwood, which shows here in the gritty style, the unflinching look at the griminess and harshness of the time, and the harshness of the language, and yes, even the sparseness of the scenery.  The violence is not dwelt on however - indeed, in many cases the coup de grce is delivered off screen, and by the end of the movie you have actually seen a lot less violence than you might expect.  In fact, the very sparseness of the script and the corollary of this seen in the seemingly endless fields, with breathtaking mountains of the Rockies in the background (it was shot in Canada) and often photographed through a snowy haze as the cowboys hunker down for the long slog, actually make the movie all the more memorable and yes, beautiful in its own way.Bleak and harsh, and yet full of warmth and humanity, and a story where people matter in an era when there was plenty of hard times and hard people to dehumanize life, make this a quietly enthralling movie, full of unexpected moments.  Criticized by some for its running time, I reveled in the leisurely pace which allowed time to relish the scenery and enjoy the pauses in the conversation.

Many of the elements of the genre are here, including the beauty and wide-open spaces of the western landscape (the film was shot in Alberta, Canada), the presence of vicious outlaws threatening the lives and welfare of the film's heroes, much gunplay, conflicts with Indians, and the vulnerability of women in a lawless land. In this case, there is the added element of a little-known fact of western history, the presence of Asian immigrants and the not uncommon fate of many Chinese women sold into lives of prostitution.As some other reviewers have already noted here, the film runs a bit long. While it attempts to provide a history lesson in American diversity and prejudice, the script tends to shy away from providing much depth. It's treatment of some themes is glancing and at times predictable. And one could also argue that an important social problem is played more for entertainment value than thought-provoking illumination.While Duvall is unbeatable in this kind of role, with the wisdom of years, a salty edge, and a self-deprecating sense of humor, the performance of Tom Haden Church helps hold the film together from start to finish. Skeptical, a bit soured by his bachelor cowboy life, and rarely smiling, he remains a wonderful foil to the older Duvall. And he gets the best line of the movie. When a madam objects to his rescue of the five Chinese girls by shouting, ""Those girls are my property,"" he replies, ""That's the price of capitalism.""The set designer for ""Deadwood"" has created a wild, woolly frontier town, and we're reminded in scene after scene that the West was unpaved. There is mud to be found almost everywhere there are people, cattle, and horses. A making-of featurette has informative interviews with many of those both in front of and behind the cameras.

Kehr ""RONCHO""","[43, 49]","Robert Duvall considered Broken Trail to form the third part of a trilogy starting with Lonesome Dove and continuing through Open Range. When I read that, I got down on my mental knees and said a novena for AMC who produced this movie for cable. Duvall has been a presence in movies since Boo Radley in To Kill A Mockingbird, opposite John Wayne in True Grit and consiglere to The Godfather but his role in Lonesome Dove was the epitome of an actor and a man in a role for all times. His character was one that reminded you of the best qualities of old friends and the independent spirit that lives within us, however shackled by circumstance and commitments we may be.So when Mr. Duvall speaks Trilogy in conjunction with Lonesome Dove, you listen...and watch.He produced this movie and had a hard time shopping the script to studios. It was written more character driven and the studio suits suggested less character and more bullets driven into cowboys.Thankfully, AMC let the whole 240 minutes play out as it was written. There is enough time for appreciating the gradual changes that occur in the characters as they react to the unusual circumstances that bring them together. And those that don't adapt or evolve tend to die- by suicide or violent means-yet this isn't one of those movies about the passing of The Old West.Overall, this is a terrific film that jumps more than a few boundaries of traditional westerns.

But ""Broken Trail"" proves that there is still life, and fresh blood, to be seen in THE American film genre. The three-hour film finds an uncle and nephew running a herd of horses to Wyoming, and unexpectedly become guardians of five Oriental women meant to become prostitutes. The journey that they all take together is a truly fascinating one, which has never been covered in this genre before.While the storytelling and cinematography are great, the two highlights are the casting and the music. Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church are fantastic as the two male leads, and well-deserved the Emmys they won for their roles. The strong supporting cast, of which there are too many to name here, do fantastic as well. The score by David Mansfield and Van Dyke Parks is truly memorable, and adds to the strengths of this epic piece.As a fan of the western, I truly enjoyed ""Broken Trail.""

The story is interesting, the acting is not bad and it does the Western genre respectfully enough.On the other hand... well, the story is also sadly predictable and has basically been done before, somewhat with the same star (Robert Duvall), in an earlier movie (see Open Range, where he co-starred with Kevin Costner for a very similar role) and if not that directly there you could try Unforgiven (with Clint Eastwood) or perhaps pick from the collection of John Wayne films which populated the genre long before this film came to pass.Personally I'd rank this effort at 3-1/2 stars, but I've rounded up rather than down to use 4 stars here.The visuals are solid here though a bit soft in spots, the sound isn't bad, but the extras that might add value are pretty sparce here with only a ""Making of"" featurette included.My best recommendation is rent this one before making a purchase.

1003338,A4JHEO7H330AF,B000GFRI4K,Tom Brody,"[2, 2]","BROKEN TRAIL is a film that is similar to RED RIVER, one of the great classics of American cinema, which stars John Wayne and Montgomery Clift.  Both of the films concern drives of livestock across hundreds of miles in the American west.  In BROKEN TRAIL, the livestock are horses, and the trip is from Oregon to Wyoming, while in RED RIVER, the livestock are cattle, and the trip is from Texas to Kansas.  Having watched RED RIVER a few times, I was expecting some sort of tension or schism to occur among the cowboys in BROKEN TRAIL, but this never materialized in BROKEN TRAIL.  Perhaps, this sort of expectation made me more involved with or interested in BROKEN TRAIL.  BROKEN TRAIL requires watching two DVD discs, each about 90 minutes long.Here are the positive features of BROKEN TRAIL.  I was not able to detect any shortcomings:(1) The cinematography is a wonder to behold, treating the viewer to beautiful landscapes of river and distant mountain crags (Canadian Rockies near Calgary).  I was under the impression that Ansel Adams was hired as a photography consultant for this film.  Great photography does not occur by accident.  Wisdom in the framing, lighting, and so on, is evident in all of the landscape scenes.(2) This movie is configured for horse-lovers.  There are endless scenes of cowboys riding on individual horses, and of the swarming herd of horses being driven through the wilderness.  The horses come in various colors (they are not all brown).  The storyline does not give any personality to any particular horse.  In contrast, for example, in GULLIVER'S TRAVELS starring Ted Danson and Mary Steenbergen, the horses talk and express their opinions on the human social condition.(3) BROKEN TRAIL has a strong moral storyline, provided by the steadfast good-guy persona of each of the cowboys, and which contrasts with that of Big Rump Kate (the madame) and her cohort of killers.  The good cowboys include Robert Duvall and Thomas Church.  In fact, I bought this movie because I liked Thomas Church, in his portrayal of The Sandman in Spiderman-3.  To be brief, none of the cowboys shows any concupiscent inclinations towards the fugitive Chinese ladies.  Another moral aspect of the cowboys, is that they take care of an older Chinese man, for example, by using a simple surgical technique to stitch up a wound on his head, and afterwards smearing the repaired wound with grease, in order to prevent infestation by flies and bacteria.(4) The storyline of BROKEN TRAIL consists of the adventures encountered while driving the herd of horses eastwards for hundreds of miles.  At one point, they encounter a group of five young Chinese women who are being transported for ""employment"" by the madame, Big Rump Kate.  The cowboys rescue the the Chinese ladies, and bring them along with them as fugitives, preventing them from being claimed as property by the bad madame.  An undercurrent of tension is provided through much of the film, because the viewer knows that the henchmen of the bad madame are tracking the cowboys, in order to capture the Chinese ladies. Near the end, there is some comedy relief, when the cowboys are approached by fierce Indians demanding two horses as a price to pass through their land.  Towards the very end of the film, the henchmen catch up.  (But don't worry, I do not tell what happens next.)(5) The movie is suitable for children from the age 12 and up.  There are a few gunfights, and a few wounds.  (But there are no flying body parts, no curse words, and no exposed topless women.)(6) For your interest, here is a bio of the actress playing the oldest of the young Chinese ladies:Gwendoline Yeo was born in Singapore.  She moved to California as a teenager, graduating with honors from St. Ignatius College Preparatory in 1994. Yeo received her BA from UCLA before the age of 20, graduating summa cum laude, as well as receiving a diploma piano from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. She specialized in playing the Chinese instrument, guzheng, and she had a radio show on NPR-KCRW.  Ms.Yeo was crowned Miss Asian America in 1995 and named Miss Chinatown USA in 1998-1999. (Okay, okay, now we know what happens to over-achievers.  They become movie stars.)(7) For your interest, here is a bio of Thomas Church:  Mr.Church was born in Yolo, California, to an Army health care worker father and a telephone company sales rep mother. He was raised in Laredo, Texas, and graduated from high school in Harlingen, Texas, in 1979, going on to attend the University of North Texas.  Church was a radio personality. A part in an independent film convinced him to move to California to pursue acting. He played the role of airport mechanic Lowell Mather for six seasons on the NBC show Wings. He worked in television for two seasons. He had supporting roles in films such as Tombstone, George of the Jungle, and The Specials.",5,"An epic ""pathway through life"" story with a happy ending.",1329523200,"02 18,

1003341,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000GFRI4K,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","Walter Hill's Broken Trail is a good but at times a little too leisurely Western miniseries following Robert Duvall and his nephew Thomas Haden Church as they try to drive a herd of horses across country only to become sidetracked when they find themselves the unlikely guardians of five Chinese girls being shipped to a brothel - and the target of some bad men determined to relieve them of both...It's curious how Robert Duvall, and actor who came to prominence playing a mob lawyer who deposited horses heads in peoples' beds, has evolved into the kind of archetypal Western figure of unquestioned decency you'd be happy to trust your life to - even more so when you remember he tried to kill John Wayne in True Grit! If he shoots someone seemingly out of the blue, you know it's someone who needs shooting (although much of the action takes place offscreen) such is his moral stature. By contrast, Church seems uncomfortable and out of place - he does well enough, but they never strike the sparks that made Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones' relationship in Lonesome Dove so memorable and affecting. And Lonesome Dove does unfortunately cast a giant shadow over this: it may be a smaller story, but, especially after Open Range, you expect more when Duvall gets in the saddle.Despite that, it's an engaging enough amble and extremely well made. Hill is one of the few working directors who still know the power of an extreme long shot, giving the show an occasional sense of the epic, though this is sometimes undercut by the fact that he generally plays his scenes in medium shots. More focused than his intriguing but scattershot Wild Bill but less impressive than The Long Riders or his under-rated Geronimo: An American Legend, it's worth a look, but you might just want to spread it over a couple of nights.",3,"""So I went and got our horses and our money... had to stretch a fella... and you start a finishing school for Chinese girls.""",1241654400,"05 7, 2009",2009,1810,"['Walter', 'Hill', 'Broken', 'Trail', 'good', 'times', 'little', 'too', 'leisurely', 'Western', 'miniseries', 'following', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'nephew', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'try', 'drive', 'herd', 'horses', 'country', 'only', 'become', 'sidetracked', 'when', 'find', 'unlikely', 'guardians', 'five', 'Chinese', 'girls', 'being', 'shipped', 'brothel', 'target', 'bad', 'men', 'determined', 'relieve', 'curious', 'how', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'actor', 'who', 'came', 'prominence', 'playing', 'mob', 'lawyer', 'who', 'deposited', 'horses', 'heads', 'peoples', 'beds', 'evolved', 'kind', 'archetypal', 'Western', 'figure', 'unquestioned', 'decency', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'trust', 'life', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'remember', 'tried', 'kill', 'John', 'Wayne', 'True', 'Grit', 'someone', 'seemingly', 'blue', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'shooting', 'much', 'action', 'place', 'offscreen', 'such', 'moral', 'stature', 'contrast', 'Church', 'uncomfortable', 'place', 'well', 'enough', 'never', 'strike', 'sparks', 'made', 'Duvall', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'relationship', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'so', 'memorable', 'affecting', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'unfortunately', 'cast', 'giant', 'shadow', 'may', 'be', 'smaller', 'story', 'especially', 'Open', 'Range', 'expect', 'more', 'when', 'Duvall', 'saddle.Despite', 'engaging', 'enough', 'amble', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'Hill', 'one', 'few', 'working', 'directors', 'who', 'still', 'know', 'power', 'extreme', 'long', 'shot', 'giving', 'show', 'occasional', 'sense', 'epic', 'sometimes', 'undercut', 'fact', 'generally', 'scenes', 'medium', 'shots', 'More', 'focused', 'intriguing', 'scattershot', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'less', 'impressive', 'Long', 'Riders', 'under-rated', 'Geronimo', 'American', 'Legend', 'look', 'might', 'just', 'want', 'spread', 'over', 'couple', 'nights']",N/A
1003342,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B000GFRI4K,Wayne C. Rogers,"[6, 7]","For those of you who are big fans of the TV mini-series, Lonesome Dove, and the Kevin Costner movie, Open Range, here's another one to wet your appetite with--Broken Trail, starring the great Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church.  It was only by accident (I was watching the Hollywood Foreign Press Awards show a few months ago and Duvall was nominated for his role in Broken Trail) that I found out about this three-hour mini-series made specifically for the American Movie Channel in 2006.  And, once I found out about it, I discovered that the mini-series was already out on DVD.  Miracles do occasionally happen!  Anyway, Broken Trail is the story of Print Ritter (played by Duvall) who inherits his sister's farm after she dies.  Her son, Tom Harte (played by Church), is left nothing because he took it upon himself to strike out on his own years earlier.  Ritter meets with Harte and explains what has happen, suggesting that maybe the both of them could join together and lead a herd of 500 horses from Oregon to Wyoming.  Since Harte has nothing to lose, he agrees to help his uncle for twenty-five percent of the profits.  In their journey across the north-western part of the country, they pick-up a Virginian gentleman/fiddler named Heck Gilpin (played by Scott Cooper), five abused and abandoned Chinese women who'd been sold into a life of slavery, a prostitute with a broken nose who's played by Greta Scacchi, and an old Chinese man played by Donald Wong.  To make matters even more complicated, they're being followed by a group of killers, led by Big Ears (played by Chris Mulkey), and there will be a final showdown.  Broken Trail delivers in full force with the majestic scenery of the northwest, a story of goodness battling evil with the killing fast and violent, the superb acting of both Robert Duvall and Thomas Hayden Church (not to mention the rest of the cast, especially Chris Mulkey as the villain who never raises his voice, yet manages to project a true sense of evil), the eye for detail and accuracy about the Old West, and the excellent direction of Walter Hill.  This is the kind of Western that you'll want to watch over and over again with Robert Duvall playing the type of role that he was born for.  The DVD extras include a twenty-minute featurette on the Making of Broken Trail.  Thank God for DVDs.  Now, when a truly excellent movie like Broken Trail appears on a TV station that you don't get, all you have to do is wait for the DVD to come out.
