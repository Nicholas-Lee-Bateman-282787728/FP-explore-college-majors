The film treads similar territory to ""Red Rock West,"" featuring J.T. Walsh in one of his most menacing roles--and Kurt Russell isn't half bad either as the viewpoint character.  In fact the only disappointing thing about the film is that Jonathan Mostow has not gone on to distinguish himself as an a-list director.The plot rests on a ""city folk"" paranoia of rural places (aka ""fly-over"" country) and smells a little bit like ""Deliverance,"" a little like the early Spielberg film ""Duel.""  Throw in some psychological tension a la Hitchcock and a breathtaking climax worthy of John Woo, and you've got yourself one brilliant, unforgettable nail-biter.  As a modern, top-notch suspense film that didn't get the attention it deserved, ""Breakdown"" is in the estimable company of similar films like ""When Strangers Appear,"" ""The Trigger Effect,"" & ""Nick of Time""--if Hitch were alive today, he might be making films like this.",5,true blue nail-biter!,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,1050,"['Massachusetts', 'couple', 'traveling', 'country', 'run', 'afoul', 'modern', 'day', 'brigands', 'highwaymen', 'excellent', 'thriller', 'film', 'treads', 'similar', 'territory', 'Red', 'Rock', 'West', 'featuring', 'J.T', 'Walsh', 'one', 'most', 'menacing', 'roles', 'Kurt', 'Russell', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'viewpoint', 'character', 'fact', 'only', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'film', 'Jonathan', 'Mostow', 'not', 'gone', 'distinguish', 'a-list', 'director.The', 'plot', 'rests', 'city', 'folk', 'paranoia', 'rural', 'places', 'fly-over', 'country', 'little', 'bit', 'Deliverance', 'little', 'early', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'Duel', 'Throw', 'psychological', 'tension', 'la', 'Hitchcock', 'breathtaking', 'climax', 'worthy', 'John', 'Woo', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'brilliant', 'unforgettable', 'nail-biter', 'modern', 'top-notch', 'suspense', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'attention', 'deserved', 'Breakdown', 'estimable', 'company', 'similar', 'films', 'When', 'Strangers', 'Appear', 'Trigger', 'Effect', 'Nick', 'Time', 'Hitch', 'were', 'alive', 'today', 'might', 'be', 'making', 'films']",Breakdown VHS
126787,A1R8LZYZR3377O,0792145496,ajsteele,"[2, 2]","Kurt Russell exceeded himself in this film. He ran the gamet of emotions with intense believability as an actor. The first time I saw Breakdown was a few years after it had been released which made me think, ""how did I miss this one?"" The genuine feelings of loss and  true desperation conveyed for his wife is spot on.A husband and his wife traveling down an empty highway into the unknown evils of his ""fellow man"" is the crux of the film. Interestingly, Breakdown never early on needs to ""prove"" how much love the couple have for one other. That one element, love, becomes immediately apparent when his wife vanishes. It socks you in the gut, and that look is all over Russell's face as he makes his first cursory search in a dusty roadside bar.There are only about six or seven charactors of substance in Breakdown and that is not a detractor. The thwarters of Russell's plight are played with such mean son of a bitc*ery that you want to reach out and ring their necks yourself. The plot is not filled with major complexity which adds to it's astounding depth and simplicity. Great well thought out action scenes drag you through the rural landscape. I really believe the film has never received the proper recognition it deserves. While watching the movie, your envolved!  A display of raw humanity is upheld by the players on every level.There is nothing missing from Kurt Russell's acting in Breakdown that makes it anything short of Acadamy Award material.

The great J.T. Walsh plays the leader of the gang, with that perfect mixture of deviousness and cool evil he mastered in so many roles, and writer/director Jonathan Mostow has crafted a tight, well written script from his story, that though it has the occasional improbability, is plausible enough to be intelligent as well as edge-of-the-seat entertainment...because we know this kind of thing has happened to people...and it could happen to you !Russell, as the helpless pawn of Walsh, is superb, and you see him becoming half-crazed, as he finds himself in a desert twilight zone, unable to get answers to his dilemma...the look in his eyes when Walsh tells him ""time to get the show on the road"" is a memorable moment in the film.Quinlan looks stunning, with a natural sensuality that is a rare thing to see these days, and though her screen-time is relatively short, she is one of the ingredients that help make this film believable.Beautiful cinematography by Doug Milstone of locations in California, Nevada and Utah, and a wonderful score Basil Poledouris add a lot to the film.Strangely, knowing the ending doesn't diminish the tension of this film...it's a gem that doesn't lose its luster even after several viewings.Total running time is 93 minutes.",5,a splendid little thriller,1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,1573,"['small', 'film', 'big', 'punch', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'attention', 'start', 'finish.There', 'tense', 'ominous', 'feeling', 'start', 'Russell', 'wife', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'end', 'up', 'stuck', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'mercy', 'menacing', 'characters', 'great', 'J.T', 'Walsh', 'leader', 'gang', 'perfect', 'mixture', 'deviousness', 'cool', 'evil', 'mastered', 'so', 'many', 'roles', 'writer/director', 'Jonathan', 'Mostow', 'crafted', 'tight', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'story', 'occasional', 'improbability', 'plausible', 'enough', 'be', 'intelligent', 'as', 'well', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'entertainment', 'know', 'kind', 'thing', 'happened', 'people', 'could', 'happen', 'Russell', 'helpless', 'pawn', 'Walsh', 'superb', 'see', 'becoming', 'half-crazed', 'desert', 'twilight', 'zone', 'unable', 'get', 'answers', 'dilemma', 'look', 'eyes', 'when', 'Walsh', 'time', 'get', 'show', 'road', 'memorable', 'moment', 'film.Quinlan', 'stunning', 'natural', 'sensuality', 'rare', 'thing', 'see', 'days', 'screen-time', 'relatively', 'short', 'one', 'ingredients', 'help', 'make', 'film', 'believable.Beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Doug', 'Milstone', 'locations', 'California', 'Nevada', 'Utah', 'wonderful', 'score', 'Basil', 'Poledouris', 'add', 'lot', 'film.Strangely', 'knowing', 'ending', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'tension', 'film', 'gem', ""n't"", 'lose', 'luster', 'even', 'several', 'viewings.Total', 'running', 'time', '93', 'minutes']",Breakdown VHS

126790,A3BFJFJRXMWXAX,0792145496,Andy Williamson,"[2, 2]","Engaging, curious, suspenseful, BELIEVABLE. All of these words describe director Jonathan Mostow's creepy suspense film ""Breakdown"". This is Mostow's first major feature film and he does not disappoint. In fact, Breakdown is easily one of the best thrillers in recent years. Mostow, through his beautiful use of camera, color, and character, leads us on the frightening journey of a Massachusetts couple who find themselves stranded in the middle of nowhere Arizona/New Mexico/Utah-a rather common occurance on long-distance trips. Yet, all is not as it seems. Unfortunately, some reviewers here have thrown in a lot of spoilers. Hopefully you read this review and not the others...There are a number of items which raise this film above the rest of the average thriller drivel...1. The gorgeous scenery of the desert. The juxtaposition of the beautiful desert and the experiences of the main characters(which are decidedly 'un-beautiful') only serve to heighten our sense that 'something is not quite right.'2. A great script without filler. No holds barred, unrelenting, and to-the-point. Thank you very much.3. Wonderful acting by Kurt Russell. I am not a big fan of his, but this film made me re-examine some of his others. He IS this character. Just the right blend of fright, anger, determination, and anxiety make this probably his best performance on film. I can't conceive of anyone else playing this role. He is the 'every man' that the audience relates to/with.4. Excellent supporting cast including the late, great JT Walsh as the helpful truck driver. Director's pray for casts that gel as this one did. Every character is utterly believable.5. A creepy soundtrack that both serves, and drives the film.I would like to address the few naysayers who say that the film is unbelievable. I am dumbfounded by that statement. What is unbelievable about one person's phone working and another person's phone not working in the same area? I guess the reviewer I have in mind has never dealt with cellular service or analogue vs. digital phones! You know, some providers DON'T OFFER SERVICE IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. Also, how in the world, by ANY standard is Russell's acting unrealistic!? It's easy to judge what someone in his situation in the film 'should have done'. But of course, as viewers of the film, OUR assumption UP FRONT is that THIS IS A BAD IDEA. When you saw the preview for this film in the theater or read the box at the video store you KNEW it was about a trip gone wrong! Duh. But put yourself in his shoes. Plus, his wife OFFERED to go!So I put the question to you ladies out there: in a similar situation, would you accept a ride from a 'kindly' stranger who offered to take you just up the road to a diner? I think the negative reviewers would be surprised by many of the responses....Let's see, what else is unbelievable? Cops who second-guess the accuser? Oh no...that NEVER happens in real life! Small towns in the middle of nowhere with strange people calling them home? Nope. Don't know ANY of those (ever been down south!?). A group of guys who conspire to take advantage of travelers in the middle of nowhere? That never happens either does it!?My point is that on the reality scale this film scores high marks-THAT IS WHY IT IS UNNERVING TO WATCH. In the back of our minds we all know that there is a small possibility of something like this happening. Guys, just think of what YOU would go through if your wife disappeared! (Actually, some of you might not mind. Maybe I should rephrase the question...) Finally, the ending of the film is somewhat controversial. Several major film critics seemed to think it crossed some sort of ethical line, an unspoken film taboo. I found the end extremely satisfying. Worked great for me. If I was in Russell's position I believe I would have had my wife do the same thing...",5,About as perfect a thriller as one can hope for.,1028678400,"08 7, 2002",2002,3857,"['Engaging', 'curious', 'suspenseful', 'BELIEVABLE', 'words', 'describe', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Mostow', 'creepy', 'suspense', 'film', 'Breakdown', 'Mostow', 'first', 'major', 'feature', 'film', 'not', 'disappoint', 'fact', 'Breakdown', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'thrillers', 'recent', 'years', 'Mostow', 'beautiful', 'use', 'camera', 'color', 'character', 'frightening', 'journey', 'Massachusetts', 'couple', 'who', 'find', 'stranded', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Arizona/New', 'Mexico/Utah-a', 'rather', 'common', 'occurance', 'long-distance', 'trips', 'not', 'Unfortunately', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'thrown', 'lot', 'spoilers', 'Hopefully', 'read', 'review', 'not', 'others', 'are', 'number', 'items', 'raise', 'film', 'rest', 'average', 'thriller', 'drivel', '1', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'desert', 'juxtaposition', 'beautiful', 'desert', 'experiences', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'decidedly', ""'un-beautiful"", 'only', 'serve', 'heighten', 'sense', ""'something"", 'not', 'quite', 'right.', '2', 'great', 'script', 'filler', 'barred', 'unrelenting', 'to-the-point', 'Thank', 'very', 'much.3', 'Wonderful', 'acting', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'film', 'made', 're-examine', 'others', 'character', 'Just', 'right', 'blend', 'fright', 'anger', 'determination', 'anxiety', 'make', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'conceive', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'role', ""'every"", 'man', 'audience', 'to/with.4', 'Excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'late', 'great', 'JT', 'Walsh', 'helpful', 'truck', 'driver', 'Director', 'pray', 'casts', 'gel', 'one', 'did', 'Every', 'character', 'utterly', 'believable.5', 'creepy', 'soundtrack', 'serves', 'film.I', 'would', 'like', 'address', 'few', 'naysayers', 'who', 'say', 'film', 'unbelievable', 'am', 'dumbfounded', 'statement', 'What', 'unbelievable', 'one', 'person', 'phone', 'working', 'person', 'phone', 'not', 'working', 'same', 'area', 'guess', 'reviewer', 'have', 'mind', 'never', 'dealt', 'cellular', 'service', 'analogue', 'digital', 'phones', 'know', 'providers', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'OFFER', 'SERVICE', 'IN', 'CERTAIN', 'AREAS', 'THE', 'COUNTRY', 'Also', 'how', 'world', 'ANY', 'standard', 'Russell', 'acting', 'unrealistic', 'easy', 'judge', 'what', 'someone', 'situation', 'film', ""'should"", 'have', 'done', 'course', 'viewers', 'film', 'OUR', 'assumption', 'UP', 'FRONT', 'THIS', 'BAD', 'IDEA', 'When', 'saw', 'preview', 'film', 'theater', 'read', 'box', 'video', 'store', 'KNEW', 'was', 'trip', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Duh', 'put', 'shoes', 'wife', 'OFFERED', 'go', 'So', 'put', 'question', 'out', 'there', 'similar', 'situation', 'would', 'accept', 'ride', ""'kindly"", 'stranger', 'who', 'offered', 'take', 'just', 'road', 'diner', 'think', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'would', 'be', 'surprised', 'many', 'responses', '.Let', 'see', 'what', 'else', 'unbelievable', 'Cops', 'who', 'second-guess', 'accuser', 'Oh', 'NEVER', 'real', 'life', 'Small', 'towns', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'strange', 'people', 'calling', 'home', 'Nope', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ANY', 'ever', 'been', 'down', 'south', 'group', 'guys', 'who', 'conspire', 'take', 'advantage', 'travelers', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'never', 'point', 'reality', 'scale', 'film', 'high', 'marks-THAT', 'IS', 'WHY', 'IT', 'UNNERVING', 'TO', 'WATCH', 'back', 'minds', 'know', 'small', 'possibility', 'something', 'happening', 'Guys', 'just', 'think', 'what', 'YOU', 'would', 'go', 'wife', 'disappeared', 'Actually', 'might', 'not', 'mind', 'Maybe', 'should', 'rephrase', 'question', 'Finally', 'ending', 'film', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'Several', 'major', 'film', 'critics', 'seemed', 'think', 'crossed', 'sort', 'ethical', 'line', 'unspoken', 'film', 'taboo', 'found', 'end', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'Worked', 'great', 'was', 'Russell', 'position', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'wife', 'do', 'same', 'thing']",Breakdown VHS

Not knowing anything of what happened, or what to do, is as scary and heartbreaking as can be. That's the plot to this intense and incredibly entertaining movie from 1997. Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan star as a couple on a cross country trip who run into some car trouble out in the middle of nowhere. They flag down a truck coming their way and a trucker named Red Barr(played by the great J.T. Walsh)climbs out and offers to help. He offers to drive them into town to use the phone but Russell doesn't want to leave the car. The wife goes with the trucker and he stays with the car. When he gets to the diner where they are supposed to meet, she isn't there and no one has seen her or the trucker. He spots the trucker and stops him but the trucker insists he has never laid eyes on him before in his life. Russell can't believe what he's hearing. His wife, Amy, has vanished. He is then captured by some criminals and is brought to the trucker, who seems to want Russell's money in exchange for his wife. This leads our devoted husband on a chase across the middle of nowhere in hopes of dodging the bad guys and finding his wife, if, in fact, she is still alive. I enjoy 'road thrillers' like this and &quot;The Hitcher&quot; and &quot;Joy Ride&quot;. This one is wonderfully done. The idea of the husband letting his wife go off with a stranger in the middle of nowhere is downright stupid, I'll give you that, but there wouldn't of been a movie without it. This is just entertainment folks. Kurt Russell is really good in this. He is very believeable as a husband who is mortified, scared, and determined to find his wife. He jumps from all kinds of emotions and does them all so realistically. Trust me, he does, no matter what some bubblehead on the next page or so says. One of his better jobs. Then there is the great J.T. Walsh. He was one of our finest character actors. This was one of his final film roles before he died of a heart attack. What a tremendous loss. He is fantastic here. Very convincing. Quinlan has a small role, but she does the best with what she's given.

126800,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,0792145496,Christopher Culver,"[1, 7]","In BREAKDOWN, Kurt Russell and Amy Quinlan play a wealthy New England couple who find horror in Iowa. While driving cross-country, their car breaks down. The various local people they meet who initially seem helpful are in fact criminals working together. The wife is kidnapped, the husband is told to pay half a million to get her back alive, and Kurt Russell decides he'd rather fight.I found this a rather lame movie. Its believability goes way down when, for example, Kurt Russell rides on the bottom of a moving truck trailer and easily finds his way up to the cab. There obvious continuity and other errors here: a villain gets a brutal rifle blast to his shoulder, but a few minutes later he's driving a car with no visible problems; a small child is shown playing video games (so it's early evening), but a few minutes later in the same scene dawn breaks.About the only entertainment here is the acting of J.T. Walsh and M.C. Gainey, who are caricatures but fun ones. Kurt Russell, on the other hand, acts like he's not particularly happy to have taken this role, and is just going through the motions until he gets his paycheck.I must say that the purported message, if any, of this film is intriguing. BREAKDOWN seems to be suggesting that decent people from the coasts shouldn't venture into flyover country, since it's the den of rednecks who lie in wait for them.

126809,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0792145496,D. Litton,"[6, 7]","&quot;Breakdown&quot; is a thriller about a couple whose car breaks down in the middle of the desert in the West. Out in the middle of nowhere, the wife hitches a ride with a truck driver, but never returns.Director Jonathon Mostow has certainly created a terrific little thriller here, infusing his scenes with genuine suspense, and a mystery surrounding the wife's disappearance that progresses very nicely. Under some very powerful performances from Kurt Russell and J.T. Walsh, this action film has a lot to offer.The movie begins with a near-accident between a Jeep and a pickup truck. In the Jeep are Jeff and Amy Taylor (Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan), a married couple moving from Massachusetts to San Diego, who are confronted by the man in the pickup when they stop at a gas station. Passing it off, they continue on their way, only to experience car trouble soon after. Luckily, a semi pulls up, offering them a ride. Amy goes, and Jeff stays behind to watch the car.When his wife does not come back, he finally realizes the car's malfunction (obviously not a mechanically inclined person), and makes his way to any place he can find, stopping at a small cafe to inquire about his wife's whereabouts; they know nothing. He catches up to Red Barr (J.T. Walsh), the man driving the semi, but Barr denies even knowing who he is as a cop searches the truck and finds nothing, no traceable evidence of Amy.So where is she? The movie keeps us at bay for quite a while, allowing Kurt Russell to give us some very dynamic acting as he plays out all of Jeff's inner collapses and states of confusion. Russell has always been good at playing the action hero, but here, he is the one being chased, the one being toyed with, and in this interesting turn of events, he pulls it off successfully, convincing us of his emotional drive to find his missing wife.J.T. Walsh is equally impressive as Warren (a.k.a. Red Barr), who, along with his road pals (including the man in the pickup from the beginning), have plans in store for Jeff, the pawn in their lethal game of chess. Walsh was gifted with one of those faces, those strong, stern faces that could cause mountains to crumble at a mere glance. Here, he is harsh and overbearing, fitting the role with an unsettling ease.As the mystery unfolds, the action begins. Russell is in even finer form during the film's second half, as he gets involved in a high-speed chase and must figure out a way to elude his pursuants. I'm going to do my best not to give away their intentions, which may come as a letdown to some, given the initial paths the story takes, but the commencing action and breath-holding finale are a tour de force of thrills, chases, and suspense-packed action.At the helm of this project is director Jonathon Mostow, who uses his photography to add to the intensity of the story. Here, he chooses to surround us with wide open spaces to convey to emptiness and vastness of the western terrain, adding to the overwhelming sense of dread that Jeff must be feeling in search of his wife. He also puts us right in the middle of some very intense car chases, and a scene involving Jeff making his way along the bottom of a moving truck is full of tension.If you are able to break down the mystery behind &quot;Breakdown,&quot; you may be at a loss. But the movie does a pretty good job of keeping it hidden from a mainstream audience, and those in the mood for a story that keeps you waiting will find pleasure in its many exciting twists. The action is intense and involving (I almost cheered at the closing credits), and Mostow knows what he is doing, as do the cast members. I had a large smile on my face after this film, a smile of satisfaction that very few movies have ever put on my face.",5,"Kinetic and fast-paced, taut and suspenseful!",996796800,"08 3, 2001",2001,3759,"['quot', 'Breakdown', 'quot', 'thriller', 'couple', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'middle', 'desert', 'West', 'Out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'wife', 'ride', 'truck', 'driver', 'never', 'returns.Director', 'Jonathon', 'Mostow', 'certainly', 'created', 'terrific', 'little', 'thriller', 'here', 'infusing', 'scenes', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'wife', 'disappearance', 'very', 'nicely', 'very', 'powerful', 'performances', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'J.T', 'Walsh', 'action', 'film', 'lot', 'offer.The', 'movie', 'near-accident', 'Jeep', 'pickup', 'truck', 'Jeep', 'are', 'Jeff', 'Amy', 'Taylor', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'married', 'couple', 'moving', 'Massachusetts', 'San', 'Diego', 'who', 'are', 'confronted', 'man', 'pickup', 'when', 'stop', 'gas', 'station', 'Passing', 'off', 'continue', 'way', 'only', 'experience', 'car', 'trouble', 'soon', 'Luckily', 'semi', 'up', 'offering', 'ride', 'Amy', 'Jeff', 'watch', 'car.When', 'wife', 'not', 'come', 'back', 'finally', 'car', 'malfunction', 'obviously', 'not', 'mechanically', 'inclined', 'person', 'way', 'place', 'can', 'find', 'stopping', 'small', 'cafe', 'inquire', 'wife', 'whereabouts', 'know', 'nothing', 'up', 'Red', 'Barr', 'J.T', 'Walsh', 'man', 'driving', 'semi', 'Barr', 'even', 'knowing', 'who', 'cop', 'truck', 'nothing', 'traceable', 'evidence', 'Amy.So', 'where', 'movie', 'bay', 'quite', 'while', 'allowing', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'give', 'very', 'dynamic', 'acting', 'out', 'Jeff', 'inner', 'collapses', 'states', 'confusion', 'Russell', 'always', 'been', 'good', 'playing', 'action', 'hero', 'here', 'one', 'being', 'chased', 'one', 'being', 'toyed', 'interesting', 'turn', 'events', 'off', 'successfully', 'convincing', 'emotional', 'drive', 'find', 'missing', 'wife.J.T', 'Walsh', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Warren', 'a.k.a', 'Red', 'Barr', 'who', 'road', 'pals', 'including', 'man', 'pickup', 'beginning', 'have', 'plans', 'store', 'Jeff', 'pawn', 'lethal', 'game', 'chess', 'Walsh', 'was', 'gifted', 'one', 'strong', 'stern', 'could', 'cause', 'mountains', 'crumble', 'mere', 'glance', 'Here', 'harsh', 'overbearing', 'fitting', 'role', 'unsettling', 'ease.As', 'mystery', 'unfolds', 'action', 'Russell', 'even', 'finer', 'form', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'involved', 'high-speed', 'chase', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'elude', 'pursuants', ""'m"", 'going', 'do', 'best', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'intentions', 'may', 'come', 'letdown', 'given', 'initial', 'paths', 'story', 'commencing', 'action', 'breath-holding', 'finale', 'are', 'tour', 'force', 'thrills', 'chases', 'suspense-packed', 'action.At', 'helm', 'project', 'director', 'Jonathon', 'Mostow', 'who', 'photography', 'add', 'intensity', 'story', 'Here', 'surround', 'wide', 'open', 'spaces', 'convey', 'emptiness', 'vastness', 'western', 'terrain', 'adding', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'dread', 'Jeff', 'must', 'be', 'feeling', 'search', 'wife', 'also', 'right', 'middle', 'very', 'intense', 'car', 'chases', 'scene', 'involving', 'Jeff', 'making', 'way', 'bottom', 'moving', 'truck', 'full', 'tension.If', 'are', 'able', 'break', 'down', 'mystery', 'quot', 'Breakdown', 'quot', 'may', 'be', 'loss', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'mood', 'story', 'waiting', 'will', 'find', 'pleasure', 'many', 'exciting', 'twists', 'action', 'intense', 'involving', 'almost', 'cheered', 'closing', 'credits', 'Mostow', 'what', 'doing', 'do', 'cast', 'members', 'had', 'large', 'smile', 'face', 'film', 'smile', 'satisfaction', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'put', 'face']",Breakdown VHS

I like to think he reacts pretty much in line with Kurt Russell's befuddled character in BREAKDOWN, a grand, seat-squirming thriller.  Protagonist Jeff Taylor does what he has to do to save his wife, but in the meantime he goes through the full gambit of emotions, from disbelief to incredulity to fear to anger to vengeance.  And is it ever fun to watch.A Massachusetts couple (Russell and Kathleen Quinlan) en route to their new lives in California suddenly finds their SUV in disrepair in the middle of Desert Nowhere.  (Or did their SUV *really* break down, perchance?)  An apparent Good Samaritan trucker (the late great J.T. Walsh is fabulous) stops by to lend assistance, and offers to take the wife to the nearest diner to phone for help.  After they depart Jeff discovers the malfunction is due to some disconnected wires under the chassis and he races off to the diner--only to find no sign of his wife, and no cooperation from the hostile locals.  And that's when the BREAKDOWN fun starts, as Jeff tries (without success) to convince local law enforcement there's been foul play, culminating in his taking his own vigilante pound of flesh to get his wife back.Walsh is a most believable villain and the action and pacing are frenetic to say the least.

It held up really well.Here's the scoop. Kurt Russell is travelling with his wife from Massachusetts to San Diego. They are driving a new Jeep, changing jobs and the chaos has left their bank account in a shambles. The Jeep breaks down in the desert. A trucker (J.T. Walsh) offers help. Russell's wife (Kathleen Quinlan) offers to go with the trucker to call for a tow while Kurt waits with the car. While waiting, Kurt finds the problem, gets the Jeep going, heads into town to find out his wife's missing and the trucker denies ever having seen him. Something's afoot and Kurt needs to get to the bottom of things.This is a ""taut thriller."" Aside from some clunky dialogue inserted to further the plot, this really had me going. The plot points were good and the action was well thought out and directed. And Russell doesn't play an ex-marine or kung-fu hero. He's a regular Joe who slowly rises to the occasion. Little by little he thinks things through and takes advantages of situations. At times, even well into the movie, he's scared out of his wits but keeps going. The climax, on afterthought, could be considered over the top, but it was still really tense. The production values were solid. No bones showing here. Acting, editing, music all blended to make this a near seamless effort.This can easily be considered typical Hollywood stuff and it is.

126816,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0792145496,Erik North,"[1, 1]","During the summer of '97, a summer that gave us great movies like THE LOST WORLD, CONTACT, and AIR FORCE ONE, certainly there was room for BREAKDOWN, wasn't there?  How in the world could so well-made a thriller as this one was escape everyone's notice?Kurt Russell is this film's Everyman, who is travelling with his wife (Kathleen Quinlan) from New England to San Diego, when they run afoul of a redneck gang in the Utah hinterlands.  One of them sets the trap for Russell's Jeep to break down, and then the leader of the gang (J.T. Walsh, chillingly despicable as always) abducts Quinlan and forces Russell to wire $90,000 as ransom for his wife's return.  Naturally, this is money that he doesn't have.After having to endure so much abuse from Walsh's sadistic underlings (the &quot;rich a**holes lookin' for trouble&quot; line really got my blood boiling, let me tell you!), however, Russell finally fights back and takes matters into his own hands, leading to a ferocious high-speed showdown.Much has been said about the fact that director and co-writer Jonathan Mostow borrows greatly from other movies.  This is true, but at least he has the good sense to borrow from some excellent ones: DUEL, STRAW DOGS, DELIVERANCE, THE VANISHING.  Russell's performance (as had been the case in TOMBSTONE) is exceptional; and Quinlan, though she isn't seen that much onscreen, still plays an important part because of Russell's ever-increasing concern for her life as the film progresses.  Walsh and his band of redneck pirates (including M.C. Gainey and Jack Noseworthy) rank right up there with the redneck rapists of DELIVERANCE and the bounty hunters from THE WILD BUNCH as the ultimate cinematic villains.Brilliantly photographed by Douglas Milsome (a veteran of Stanley Kubrick's films; he lensed FULL METAL JACKET) and shot mostly on locations in Arizona, Utah, Nevada, and southwestern California, BREAKDOWN remains one of the most underappreciated thrillers of all times.  Hopefully, however, that status will change.

It was a Number 1 hit when released in theatres in May 1997, though, bizarrely, it took a whole year to reach the UK when I saw it in May 1998. Kind of odd for a successful film with a big-name star. Produced and financed by Dino DeLaurentis, Breakdown was released by Paramount in the US and Fox in the UK. I guess the rights are stuck in a loophole, it's the only reason I can think of as to why it's currently out-of-print.Kurt Russell is Jeff Taylor, a man traveling across America with his hot wife. In the last leg of their Boston-San Diego move, their car freezes-up and stops dead by the road. A friendly trucker offers them help. Hot wife goes off with him to get a tow-truck. She doesn't return. Jeff, panic increasing by the second, tracks down the trucker, Warren 'Red' Barr (played by the late JT Walsh), but the man denies ever meeting him or his wife. Panic turns to anger, and anger turns to terror, as Jeff is hurled into a kidnap/ransom plot. With no one to turn to for help he has to use his wits and rely on chance to turn the tables on the bad guys.At a stripped-down, incredibly terse 93 minutes, Breakdown wastes no time with long set-ups. There are no long speeches, no unnecessary deviations, just action and suspense. Kurt Russell carries much of the film with facial expressions. Though I have to say I wish Jonathan Mostow kept a tighter reign on his acting, as he tend to overdo it a bit. Plus some of his dialogue is repetitive and cliched. Yes, there are a few plot holes and gaps in the logic (the useless cop cliche really gets on my nerves) but at such a brisk pace the film doesn't have time to dwell on them.With shades of Duel, Deliverance, and the Vanishing, Breakdown offers a few exciting car chases, lonely desert locations, and one hell of an evil villain.

The movie does not rely on computer graphics or bloody violence in order to create the suspense. The story focuses on a young couple who are traveling across country heading to California for a new life. While in Arizona(at least that is what most license plates show)on an open stretch of road, their car breaks down.A friendly truck driver stops in order to help and offer a free ride. The couple agree that the wife should go and the husband waits on her and the tow truck. Once he discovers what caused the breakdown he goes to the agreed upon meeting site, Bell's Diner. However, he gets no answers from the locals at the diner nor the truck driver who gave his wife a ride. A series of phone calls to police do no good, so he must find out for himself what really happened. The more he finds out the more danger he comes across and he soon finds out that his breakdown and his wife's disappearance were no accident.

Unfortunately, to a lot of people this is like saying that MD 20/20 is one of your favorite wines.  Kurt Russell seems to get less respect than Rodney Dangerfield, even though  Kurt is demonstrably more talented and charismatic than a lot of actors  with Oscars on their mantelpieces. It's true he's made some bad choices  (don't get me started on &quot;Stargate&quot; or &quot;Captain Ron&quot;),  but really, when you look at other prominent leading actors, have Kurt's  choices been all that much worse than theirs? In any case,  &quot;Breakdown&quot; is a prime example of what Kurt can do when given a  decent role. The movie is exciting and well-shot, with superb character  actors like the late J.T. Walsh in support, but it is Kurt's performance  which makes this movie, and it is impossible to imagine any other actor in  the role. &quot;Breakdown&quot; speaks to Kurt's great strengths as an  actor: his subtle expressivity, his ability to gain the sympathy of the  audience without overtly playing for it, and his astonishing athleticism  (Kurt did nearly all his own stunts for this movie, some of which would  make Evel Knievel blanch).

A friendly trucker comes along, offers help, and Quinlan accepts a ride to a nearby diner to call for help while Russell waits with the car.  He gets the car started on his own, and heads to the diner.  His wife is nowhere to be found, and when Russell catches up with the trucker, the trucker denies any knowledge of the knowing him or his wife.That's the setup that takes place in the first twenty minutes or so.  After that, BREAKDOWN is a thriller as Russell, a meek man driver by desparation, tries to figure out what has happened to his wife with very little evidence to go on.  There are chase scenes galore.The situation is actually quite preposterous, and gets more so as the movie goes along.  The scheme that is uncovered is very elaborate, and seems like an awful lot of trouble for the culprits to go through.  But Kurt Russell is so down to earth and believable, and the bad guys actually quite mundane, that the plot somehow doesn't seem totally ridiculous.  The movie, obviously fairly low budget, is gritty and not too glossy.  There aren't too many explosions, but there are PLENTY of cliffhangers, and because we can so readily identify with Russell's character, thanks to his convincing performance, we really feel for him and what he is going through.  Situations that might seem like minor jeopardy in something more grandiose (like a DIE HARD movie, perhaps) are very tense and exciting in BREAKDOWN.As I said, Russell is very good.  It's interesting that this actor, who has been ""famous"" since a teen, is so convincing playing an ""everyman"" type.  He's handsome, but not too much so, and when he runs around crazily, or is involved in a chase scene, he doesn't just suddenly develop amazing abilities.  He looks scared, dirty, sweaty and ticked off.  He is a man driven by shear fear for his wife, and anger.  It's a convincing performance,and one of his best.Quinlan, who understandably isn't in much of the movie, is also very good, and is a convincing match with Russell.  JT Walsh, the main bad guy, is very good because he never really drops the veneer of being a regular guy,except in a couple of scenes.  This was the wonderful character actor's last movie, and he left with a doozy.This movie didn't do to well at the box office, but word of mouth has really helped it out on video.  If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.  It is rated R, but the main reason for that is not graphic violence (there's not much blood, really) but just an occasional outburst of bad language.  It's a thriller that would work well for those who don't like a lot of gore and gunplay.",4,Exciting and believable,1045958400,"02 23, 2003",2003,2771,"['youngish', 'couple', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'are', 'moving', 'Massachusetts', 'California', 'somewhere', 'southwestern', 'desert', 'new', 'SUV', 'down', 'friendly', 'trucker', 'along', 'help', 'Quinlan', 'ride', 'nearby', 'diner', 'call', 'help', 'Russell', 'car', 'car', 'started', 'own', 'heads', 'diner', 'wife', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'when', 'Russell', 'up', 'trucker', 'trucker', 'knowledge', 'knowing', 'setup', 'place', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'BREAKDOWN', 'thriller', 'Russell', 'meek', 'man', 'driver', 'desparation', 'tries', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'wife', 'very', 'little', 'evidence', 'go', 'are', 'chase', 'scenes', 'galore.The', 'situation', 'actually', 'quite', 'preposterous', 'more', 'so', 'movie', 'along', 'scheme', 'uncovered', 'very', 'elaborate', 'awful', 'lot', 'trouble', 'culprits', 'go', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'so', 'down', 'earth', 'believable', 'bad', 'guys', 'actually', 'quite', 'mundane', 'plot', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'seem', 'totally', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'obviously', 'fairly', 'low', 'budget', 'gritty', 'not', 'too', 'glossy', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'explosions', 'are', 'PLENTY', 'cliffhangers', 'can', 'so', 'readily', 'identify', 'Russell', 'character', 'thanks', 'convincing', 'performance', 'really', 'feel', 'what', 'going', 'Situations', 'might', 'seem', 'minor', 'jeopardy', 'something', 'more', 'grandiose', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'are', 'very', 'tense', 'exciting', 'BREAKDOWN.As', 'said', 'Russell', 'very', 'good', 'interesting', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'famous', 'teen', 'so', 'convincing', 'playing', 'everyman', 'type', 'handsome', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'crazily', 'involved', 'chase', 'scene', ""n't"", 'just', 'suddenly', 'develop', 'amazing', 'abilities', 'scared', 'dirty', 'sweaty', 'ticked', 'off', 'man', 'driven', 'shear', 'fear', 'wife', 'anger', 'convincing', 'performance', 'one', 'best.Quinlan', 'who', 'understandably', ""n't"", 'much', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'convincing', 'match', 'Russell', 'JT', 'Walsh', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'very', 'good', 'never', 'really', 'veneer', 'being', 'regular', 'guy', 'couple', 'scenes', 'was', 'wonderful', 'character', 'actor', 'last', 'movie', 'left', 'doozy.This', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'word', 'mouth', 'really', 'helped', 'out', 'video', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'highly', 'recommend', 'rated', 'R', 'main', 'reason', 'not', 'graphic', 'violence', 'not', 'much', 'blood', 'really', 'just', 'occasional', 'outburst', 'bad', 'language', 'thriller', 'would', 'work', 'well', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'lot', 'gore', 'gunplay']",Breakdown VHS
126857,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,0792145496,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","Breakdown(released May/97)stars Kurt Russell as Jeff Taylor and Kathleen Quinlan as his wife Amy.This is a very taut thriller,full of suspense and surprises,which keeps the pace going at full throttle throughout.The plot involves the Taylors moving from Massachusetts to California and traveling the scenic roads through the southwestern U.S.Jeff has been driving solo for quite a while and as he reaches back for a flask of coffee,upon his return a pick up truck pulls out of the desert and onto the road.He is forced to act quickly and barely avoids a collision.Later while filling up with gas down the road,the  driver of the same pick up he almost collided with,is there also and the two have a small confrontation.Soon though,it's back on the road but after a few minutes their vehicle suddenly sputters out and they become stranded.Jeff and his wife stare at their engine and are ruminating on their fate,when a trucker happens along and offers some help.Jeff at first refuses but his wife changes his mind and she hops a ride to the nearest truck stop just 5 miles away and says she will return with a tow truck.All alone he stares at the engine but eventually spies some wires pulled down under the engine area.He re-joins them and is off and running.He reaches the truck stop,Belles Diner,but no one has apparently seen his wife.He heads out onto the road again and spies the truck and driver that picked up his wife.He stops the truck and he has an ugly confrontation with the driver,who claims he has never seen him or his wife before.A policeman just happens along and he searches the truck but can find no evidence of foul play.Instead he lets the trucker go and he advises Jeff to go to town and fill out a report for his deputy there.This he does and when he is done he heads back to the diner.Amy still hasn't surfaced and while he uses the phone a young man cleaning a car  nearby says that he has seen his wife and tells him where she might be.He heads out to that area but is ambushed.He and his vehicle end up in a fast flowing river,becoming a shooting target along the way.Jeff escapes and circles around only to get knocked out and kidnapped.When he comes to he is on a ridge overlooking a small town.The leader of this operation is none other than the trucker,with his accomplices the pick up truck driver and the young man who gave him directions out there.The trucker demands he go to town and draw out a large sum of money for ransom or he will never see his wife again.He goes into town and withdraws everything he can,but far short of what the men wanted.He is picked up outside of town by the pick up truck driver.When the driver realizes the bag of money is far short of what they demanded,Jeff springs into action by plunging a letter opener he acquired at the bank,into the shoulder of the driver.In the ensuing struggle Jeff manages to overpower the driver and take control of the pick up.Just as he does a policeman passes by,but sensing some suspicious activity,turns around and chases the pick up down.The policeman forces Jeff onto the ground while the yells for his passenger(who Jeff tied up with duct tape)to come out.He does but with a gun drawn with which to shoot the police officer.With the officer down Jeff escapes down a hill,as the driver takes aim on Jeff.Before he can pull the trigger the wounded cop shoots him down.Jeff returns to the policeman and assists him calling for an ambulance,then leaves.Jeff heads to a truck stop the pick driver had mentioned and he finds the leader/trucker there.He hitches a ride,precariously hanging on underneath the rig.He makes his way to the cab and sits behind the driver area until the trucker reaches his home.It is there,in a barn,Jeff bails out and watches the trucker and his accomplices,which have subsequently joined him,unload his wife and throw her into a freezer below the barn floor.The barn itself is loaded with merchandise picked up from other folks like the Taylors,as this ""operation"" of theirs has been going on a long,long time.Jeff cannot find the keys to the lock to the underground freezer area,which he has unsuccessfully tried to pry open.He does find a gun and enters the truckers home and confronts the group.One escapes while he locks the rest in the underground freezer area,but not before freeing Amy.The two flee to a trailer on the grounds,beside which is a pick up truck.As they search for the keys for the truck,the trucker comes bearing down on them with his rig and tears through the trailer like it is paper.As he wheels around for another pass at them,they find the keys and flee in the pick up in the nick of time.Just when they think they have escaped on the highway,they get caught between two cars and the truckers big rig behind them.The two cars are eventually taken out but the truck keeps on coming.It all ends on a bridge as the trucker manages to get their pick up sideways in front of his truck.He then proceeds to push them over the guardrail to the creek bed below.Amy is wedged in the pick up but Jeff gets out and gets inside the truckers cab.In the struggle the truck itself goes over the rail and is being held from falling into the creek bed by a slightly protruding bridge strut.Jeff and the trucker climb to the top of the cab and fight it out.How will the film end? You have to watch it to find out,my friends.The film certainly has an intriguing plot,and the entire cast is on their game from the get go.When Amy isn't there at the diner,Kurt's desperation climbs slowly but surely.And when he finally meets up again with the trucker and he denies ever seeing him,we now know something terrible has happened to Amy...but what? That's where the movie goes and it is quite the ride.The suspense never lets up from that point on.Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r and is clear and crisp.Besides the trailer there are no extras.A highly recommended film with a storyline that pulls you in from the start.Russell shines as the desperate husband trying to find his wife,pulled into something he has to inexorably try to free he and his wife from.4 -4 1/2 stars/.",4,Breakdown-is it as simple as all that?,1344211200,"08 6, 2012",2012,6127,"['Breakdown', 'released', 'May/97', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Jeff',

After talking to a redneck trucker because their Jeep breaks down in the Utah desert, the terrifing fun begins. Just like in Spielberg's Duel, malevolence arrives in the semblance of a big truck. The trucker named Red (J.T. Walsh) agrees to give Amy a lift to the nearest pay phone while Jeff stays with the car.Now, it's easy to wonder why in the world Jeff would let his wife ride off with a total stranger in an 18 wheeler, but put yourself in the same situation and you would probably do the same thing.  One goes to get help, the other stays with the automobile.Amy disappears, never turning up at Belle's Diner, where she was supposed to meet with Jeff. The customers have never seen her. And when Jeff chases down Red's rig, Amy is nowhere to be found. Worse, Red claims that he's never seen Jeff before in his life.What now happens is, ""lets find the wife.""  What an awesome thrill ride that the entire cast gives, especially Russell as the nervous, ready to enter the booby hatch husband who let his wife loose the grip of his loving hand back on that lonesome highway when a nice trucker said, ""Come with me, I can help.""  Russell turns out an amazing performance as the obsessed husband who let his wife get away.

Jeff Taylor (Kurt Russell) and his wife Amy (Kathleen Quinlan) are moving to California when suddenly their jeep stalls and breaks down in a remote area of Nevada and things go downhill from there. The movie works so well because the the story is so believable, with the lead characters accordingly empathetic. Kurt Russell gives an excellent performance as the husband torn between the terror of losing his wife and the murderous rage he feels towards her abductors. However, the show is stolen by the late J.T. Walsh who does a great job going from kind, helpful passerby to cold blooded kidnapper. Also, the supporting cast in this film are excellent. Breakdown is a thrilling movie with some great, slightly over the top, action scenes that manages to maintain a steady and exciting pace.

126868,AXKWFTTW5OGJ7,0792145496,"TCG ""playboy2196@yahoo.com""","[5, 6]","In 1997 I had the misfortune of seeing the coming attractions trailer for BREAKDOWN, a film with Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan, two performers I have always liked and respected.  I groaned - this film looked like just another run-of-the-mill, headache-inducing, Jerry Bruckheimer over-the-top actionfest with absolutely no basis in reality.  Foolishly, I avoided this film until I found myself at a drive-in Scottsdale, AZ.  BREAKDOWN was just about the only movie on the list that looked remotely interesting, though I had sincere doubts.  Reluctantly, I paid admission, fearing the worst.Oh, my God, was I wrong.  What a movie!!!  My initial reservations about this film were completely erased halfway through the story.  Years of watching ludicrous testosterone-driven action epics with amusement park-like thrills almost prevented me from seeing one of the best films of the 1990's.  I watched the film from the hood of my rental car.  I thought the paint would permanently adhere to my sweaty palms.BREAKDOWN is a near masterpiece.  To disclose the plot would destroy a nail-biting motion picture experience.  In fact, be warned, as the film is almost too gripping to be enjoyable.  There is such an overwhelming sense of menace and peril in this film that it almost becomes a cruel experiment in fear.For a first-time directing job by Jonathan Mostow, it's awe-inspiring.  The opening credits sequence alone is imaginative and appropriate to the story.  It has been a longtime indeed since this level of suspense has seen the light of day on the silver screen.  It's so good, in fact, that it's hard to believe that it ever got made.  Amazing that it was not the blockbuster that it deserved to be.Shooting in the 2.35:1 Panavision ratio, Mr. Mostow has created an unbelievably plausible scenario replete with three of the most frightening villians the movies have ever seen.  They certainly give Bill McKinney and Herbert &quot;Cowboy&quot; Coward, the mountain men in DELIVERANCE, a run for their money.  J. T. Walsh, who unfortunately passed away not too long after this film was released (his death is a real loss to the film world), appears in probably the best performance of his career: a purely evil man who doubles as an everyday Joe who loves his wife and son but commits terrible acts for money.  M. C. Gainey, a towering giant who could rip you in half with his own two hands, is brilliant as Earl, one of the conspirators. You would not want to cross this man.  Jack Noseworthy is equally maniacal as the third villian.BREAKDOWN succeeds for the same reason that Steven Spielberg's DUEL does (though DUEL is more cinematic): it takes two ordinary human beings and thrusts them into a horrendous situation they'd never have any reason to suspect they'd ever be a part of.  That is not to say that the film does not have a few convenient plot devices, but even when it does they can be forgiven.Kurt Russell - my God, he's just brilliant.  I loved him as Snake Plissken in JOHN CARPENTER'S ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK.  He's such an amazing actor.  The look of terror and fear on his face is complete and real.  Basil Poledouris, who scored CONAN THE BARBARIAN, one of the best scores of the 1980's, provides a tremendous score to this film.  The tension in the sequence prior to the unbelievably tense and superbly edited ending is made all the more so due to his phenomenal score.Although I have a slight problem with the ending (it contains a few elements that are farfetched), it still remains one of the most gripping action sequences your likely to see in any film.I cannot say enough about this film.  It's completely riveting from start to finish, and is one of only a handful of 1990's films that I can watch over and over again.  The week that I purchased the DVD I watched the film six times.  I was just as engrossed as I was upon my initial viewing.The DVD looks and sounds great, though the lack of anamorphic enhancement is disappointing.  Hopefully, Paramount will re-issue this title soon with a commentary by the director.  Recall that DVDs were fairly new when this film was released.  This film is far superior to Mr. Mostow's submarine film U-571.  I'd love to hear his thoughts on the casting and comments on the making of the film.One major warning: Do not watch this film on television.  It's been on TV twice, and it's completely ruined.  Commercials cause this film to break down (sorry - couldn't resist).If I could give this film ten stars, I would.  Watch it.  It's brilliant.",5,BREAKDOWN Never Breaks Down,984528000,"03 14, 2001",2001,4519,"['1997', 'had', 'misfortune', 'seeing', 'coming', 'attractions', 'trailer', 'BREAKDOWN', 'film', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'two', 'performers', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'respected', 'groaned', 'film', 'looked', 'just', 'run-of-the-mill', 'headache-inducing', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'over-the-top', 'actionfest', 'absolutely', 'basis', 'reality', 'Foolishly', 'avoided', 'film', 'found', 'drive-in', 'Scottsdale', 'AZ', 'BREAKDOWN', 'was', 'just', 'only', 'movie', 'list', 'looked', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'had', 'sincere', 'doubts', 'Reluctantly', 'paid', 'admission', 'fearing', 'worst.Oh', 'God', 'was', 'wrong', 'What', 'movie', 'initial', 'reservations', 'film', 'were', 'completely', 'erased', 'halfway', 'story', 'Years', 'watching', 'ludicrous', 'testosterone-driven', 'action', 'epics', 'amusement', 'park-like', 'thrills', 'almost', 'prevented', 'seeing', 'one', 'best', 'films', '1990', 'watched', 'film', 'hood', 'rental', 'car', 'thought', 'paint', 'would', 'permanently', 'adhere', 'sweaty', 'palms.BREAKDOWN', 'near', 'masterpiece', 'disclose', 'plot', 'would', 'destroy', 'nail-biting', 'motion', 'picture', 'experience', 'fact', 'be', 'warned', 'film', 'almost', 'too', 'gripping', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'such', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'menace', 'peril', 'film', 'almost', 'cruel', 'experiment', 'fear.For', 'first-time', 'directing', 'job', 'Jonathan', 'Mostow', 'awe-inspiring', 'opening', 'credits', 'sequence', 'alone', 'imaginative', 'appropriate', 'story', 'been', 'longtime', 'indeed', 'level', 'suspense', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'silver', 'screen', 'so', 'good', 'fact', 'hard', 'believe', 'ever', 'got', 'made', 'Amazing', 'was', 'not', 'blockbuster', 'deserved', 'be.Shooting', '2.35:1', 'Panavision', 'ratio', 'Mr.', 'Mostow', 'created', 'unbelievably', 'plausible', 'scenario', 'replete', 'three', 'most', 'frightening', 'villians', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'certainly', 'give', 'Bill', 'McKinney', 'Herbert', 'quot', 'Cowboy', 'quot', 'Coward', 'mountain', 'men', 'DELIVERANCE', 'run', 'money', 'J.', 'T.', 'Walsh', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'passed', 'away', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'death', 'real', 'loss', 'film', 'world', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'purely', 'evil', 'man', 'who', 'everyday', 'Joe', 'who', 'wife', 'son', 'commits', 'terrible', 'acts', 'money', 'M.', 'C.', 'Gainey', 'towering', 'giant', 'who', 'could', 'rip', 'half', 'own', 'two', 'hands', 'brilliant', 'Earl', 'one', 'conspirators', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'cross', 'man', 'Jack', 'Noseworthy', 'equally', 'maniacal', 'third', 'villian.BREAKDOWN', 'same', 'reason', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'DUEL', 'DUEL', 'more', 'cinematic', 'two', 'ordinary', 'human', 'beings', 'horrendous', 'situation', ""'d"", 'never', 'have', 'reason', 'suspect', ""'d"", 'ever', 'be', 'part', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'few', 'convenient', 'plot', 'devices', 'even', 'when', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven.Kurt', 'Russell', 'God', 'just', 'brilliant', 'loved', 'Snake', 'Plissken', 'JOHN', 'CARPENTER', 'ESCAPE', 'FROM', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'such', 'amazing', 'actor', 'look', 'terror', 'fear', 'face', 'complete', 'real', 'Basil', 'Poledouris', 'who', 'scored', 'CONAN', 'THE', 'BARBARIAN', 'one', 'best', 'scores', '1980', 'tremendous', 'score', 'film', 'tension', 'sequence', 'prior', 'unbelievably', 'tense', 'superbly', 'edited', 'ending', 'made', 'more', 'so', 'due', 'phenomenal', 'score.Although', 'have', 'slight', 'problem', 'ending', 'few', 'elements', 'are', 'farfetched', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'gripping', 'action', 'sequences', 'likely', 'see', 'film.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'film', 'completely', 'riveting', 'start', 'finish', 'one', 'only', 'handful', '1990', 'films', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'week', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'watched', 'film', 'six', 'times', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'engrossed', 'was', 'initial', 'viewing.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'lack', 'anamorphic', 'enhancement', 'disappointing', 'Hopefully', 'Paramount', 'will', 're-issue', 'title', 'soon', 'commentary', 'director', 'Recall', 'DVDs', 'were', 'fairly', 'new', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'film', 'far', 'superior', 'Mr.', 'Mostow', 'submarine', 'film', 'U-571', ""'d"", 'love', 'hear', 'thoughts', 'casting', 'comments', 'making', 'film.One', 'major', 'warning', 'Do', 'not', 'watch', 'film', 'television', 'been', 'TV', 'twice', 'completely', 'ruined', 'Commercials', 'cause', 'film', 'break', 'down', 'sorry', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', '.If', 'could', 'give', 'film', 'ten', 'stars', 'would', 'Watch', 'brilliant']",Breakdown VHS

The couple is on their way from Boston to San Diego, when their vehicle breaks down somewhere in the Southwest (Arizona?), along a deserted stretch of road.  A passing trucker named Red Barr (J. T. Walsh) offers to lend a hand, and Amy leaves with him to call a tow truck while Jeff waits with the car.Taylor gets his car started and arrives at the roadside stop where his wife was to have called for help, but she is nowhere to be found.  Spotting Barr's truck on the road, he forces him to stop, but the trucker denies ever having seen him before.  A passing sheriff intervenes, but a search of the truck reveals nothing.  Taylor files a police report and returns to the roadside stop to await developments.  From there, he is put through his worst nightmare, discovering that he and his wife, are the victims of a predatory gang of thieves, kidnappers and probable killers.The late J. T. Walsh is marvelously slimy, as the despicable leader of the group.  The actors playing the other members of the gang do such a wonderful job as subhuman members of society, they could be poster boys for different breeds of lowlife.  Kurt Russell delivers a near perfect performance as a man pushed well beyond the normal limits.  Kathleen Quinlan's screen time is limited, but she is there to deliver a crushing and well deserved coup de grace.Breakdown is tight, a film of continuous action, where the plot proceeds smartly with hardly a misstep.  A marvelous well-written gem, that builds the tension and suspense, jamming the events into about a 24 hour period, saving the wild action until the very end.

Somewhere in Arizona -- in the middle of nowhere -- their SUV breaks down. They are beset by a team of guys that make money on the side by robbing/killing innocent travelers. Their breakdown devolves into an utter nightmare.""Breakdown"" brings to mind three pictures:-- Spielberg's first TV film ""Duel"" (1971) Starring Dennis Weaver, which was perhaps the first film addressing the subject of road rage.-- The 1975 film ""Race with the Devil"" starring Peter Fonda, which was a car chase thriller about four vacationers and their accidental run-in with a gaggle of Satanists.-- And, lastly, the 1988/1993 film ""The Vanishing."" There are two versions with different actors (but the same director); the first taking place in Europe, the other in America. The story involves a man's obsessive search for his girlfriend who was apparently kidnapped while they were parked at a rest stop.""Breakdown"" successfully combines elements of all three of these pictures, while remaining unique. In fact, ""Breakdown"" is arguably the best of the batch. So, if you liked any of these films, chances are you'll appreciate ""Breakdown.""It should also be noted that the film is great for people who like desert stories or enjoy Southwest scenery.BOTTOM LINE: ""Breakdown"" is nothing deep, but it's an intense, engaging, realistic thriller along the lines of ""Duel,"" albeit more eventful. It will definitely grab and hold your attention its entire 90 minute length. There's a great scene at the end that makes a simple statement: Some people have so foolishly opened their hearts to EVIL -- in this case greed, hate, violence and murder -- that they have BECOME hideous non-human monsters (by their own choice). For the sake of society, such people MUST be utterly wiped out from this plane of existence. Hey, ""the wages of sin is death."" Unfortunately we can't trust our ""justice"" system any longer.One reviewer irately complained that the story is unrealistic near the beginning of the film; specifically the part where Kurt lets his wife leave with a truck driver while he stays behind to watch his vehicle. He referred to this as an incredibly stupid decision. But I personally don't see what's so ""unrealistic"" or ""stupid"" about it. They're broke down in the middle of nowhere and their phone won't work. The truck driver who offers to take them to the next stop is seemingly normal, benevolent, helpful and friendly. Both of them couldn't go because one had to stay and guard their vehicle, which contained many of their possessions (remember, they were moving). And it wouldn't have been right for Kurt to let his wife stay alone with the jeep since there was some hick nutjob roaming the local area who had harrassed them a bit earlier, not to mention they didn't have any type of weapon. It was a bad situation and Kurt chose the safest, most reasonable option available.""Breakdown"" strangely didn't do very well at the box office in 1997. It has, however, been a bit of a hit on video/DVD since that time.
