If you liked the series, then the DVD is for you. They took two episodes of Baywatch and made a DVD with them. I personnally loved this DVD since I am a Baywatch Fan. Erika Eleniak is in both episodes, Pamela and Nicole Eggert are in only one of them.For Baywatchs fans, this DVD is a MUST.",4,"2 episodes of Baywatch, great DVD",1010361600,"01 7, 2002",2002,413,"['did', ""n't"", 'produce', 'more', 'DVDs', 'Baywatch', ""'d"", 'like', 'Specially', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'include', 'Yasmine', 'Bleeth', 'liked', 'series', 'then', 'DVD', 'took', 'two', 'episodes', 'Baywatch', 'made', 'DVD', 'personnally', 'loved', 'DVD', 'am', 'Baywatch', 'Fan', 'Erika', 'Eleniak', 'episodes', 'Pamela', 'Nicole', 'Eggert', 'are', 'only', 'one', 'them.For', 'Baywatchs', 'fans', 'DVD', 'MUST']",Baywatch: Nightmare Bay/River of No Return

503812,A1LCKQPHXG4J5T,B00000ILFP,Miah Thorpatrick,"[0, 0]","This is a great DVD if you are a fan of the old early-to-mid 90s era of Baywatch.  Of course it became utterly useless when they released Season 2,3, and 4 (marked as Season 1,2 & 3 on the DVD packaging) on Region 1 DVD a couple years ago, and the 2 two-part episodes on this set are apart of those seasons.  But I still highly recommend it(if you can afford the absurd prices).  Why?  Nightmare Bay Pt 1 & 2(Season 2 premiere) and River of No Return Pt 1 & 2(Season 3 premiere) are strangely omitted from those releases.  Still not sure why.  Something about copyrights to these episodes.What makes this so baffling is that River of No Return in particular is a very important episode in this era of Baywatch.  It introduces C.J. Parker first and foremost, and it may even introduce Matt and Summer.  I don't really recall.  More importantly it's the last episode to feature Eddie & Shauni which bridges the gap between Season 2 and 3 and even of more importance, it gives us closure to Eddie and Shauni as to why they aren't in Season 3.  Without this episode, the show goes from featuring Eddie & Shauni, then in the blink of an eye, they are gone with no explanation and C.J., Matt, and Summer are now at Baywatch which is how one would see it on the Region 1 DVDs.Having said that, the value of this DVD is worth the asking prices (if you are a fan, of course).",4,Nice little DVD,1251849600,"09 2, 2009",2009,1366,"['great', 'DVD', 'are', 'fan', 'old', 'early-to-mid', '90s', 'era', 'Baywatch', 'course', 'became', 'utterly', 'useless', 'when', 'released', 'Season', '2,3', '4', 'marked', 'Season', '1,2', '3', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'Region', '1', 'DVD', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', '2', 'two-part', 'episodes', 'set', 'are', 'apart', 'seasons', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'can', 'afford', 'absurd', 'prices', 'Why', 'Nightmare', 'Bay', 'Pt', '1', '2', 'Season', '2', 'premiere', 'River', 'No', 'Return', 'Pt', '1', '2', 'Season', '3', 'premiere', 'are', 'strangely', 'omitted', 'releases', 'Still', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Something', 'copyrights', 'episodes.What', 'so', 'baffling', 'River', 'No', 'Return', 'particular', 'very', 'important', 'episode', 'era', 'Baywatch', 'C.J', 'Parker', 'first', 'foremost', 'may', 'even', 'introduce', 'Matt', 'Summer', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'recall', 'More', 'importantly', 'last', 'episode', 'feature', 'Eddie', 'Shauni', 'gap', 'Season', '2', '3', 'even', 'more', 'importance', 'closure', 'Eddie', 'Shauni', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'Season', '3', 'episode', 'show', 'featuring', 'Eddie', 'Shauni', 'then', 'blink', 'eye', 'are', 'gone', 'explanation', 'C.J.', 'Matt', 'Summer', 'are', 'now', 'Baywatch', 'how', 'one', 'would', 'see', 'Region', '1', 'DVDs.Having', 'said', 'value', 'DVD', 'asking', 'prices', 'are', 'fan', 'course']",Baywatch: Nightmare Bay/River of No Return
503813,A15W70BFY26KIA,B00000ILFP,Mr Ghostface,"[7, 7]","Just swell.I bought this DVD thinking that 'Nightmare Bay' was, as described, 'the feature-length movie that started it all'. Wrong. As I discovered upon watching it, and remembering back about ten years, 'Nightmare Bay' is actually the two-parter that started the SECOND season. 'Panic At Malibu Pier' was the real pilot film, and the one I was really after. I wouldn't mind so much, but it was neither the film I was after, nor was it very good. The second season was made with a small cast and lacked any of the glamour of the first or subsequent few seasons. 'River of No Return' is a bit better, being the start of the 3rd season and the story where Pamela Anderson, Nicole Eggert and David Charvet were introduced (and where Billy Warlock and Erica Eleniak bowed out).So, if it's the pilot you're after, this isn't it. The only place I have found it is on Amazon.co.uk, on the VHS PAL format. That's okay for me, but most Amazon.com shoppers are probably live in the US and need NTSC. Hope this helped.",3,Wait a minute!
