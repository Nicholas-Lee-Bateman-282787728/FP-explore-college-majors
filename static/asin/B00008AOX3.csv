737758,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B00008AOX3,Amanda,"[10, 13]","I do.I remember when it was a mid-season replacement on the WB, back when I didn't have the WB in my cable service. I'd heard so much about this show, but I couldn't watch it. I was so excited about seeing it, imagine how happy I was when UPN started playing the episodes. It was like they had answered my prayers! I immediately fell in love with it. It was like nothing I had ever seen before. Beautiful kids cruising around high school, spouting big words and clever phrases at each other. You had the inspiring filmmaker (Dawson) and his tomboy best friend Joey. Joey was so sweet and so beautiful, but Dawson's sight was set on the new girl from New York, Jen. Then, there was Pacey, the slacker of the group who, even though he was not supposed to be as smart as the rest, still liked to use the big words. Put them all together, and you get one of the best first seasons of any show.I mean, who did not sympathize with Joey? Katie Holmes did such a wonderful job with that character, I almost wanted to reach into my television, pat Joey on the shoulder and say, ""It's ok. He'll come around. He'll see how cool you are."" Who has never been in love with someone who is in love with someone else? Anyone could relate to Joey. Actually, anyone could relate to any one of these characters. In the beginning, they were believable high school kids. We loved them. We wanted to be like them. That's how good this show was.Now, I haven't watched the show since, well, since before they graduated high school. That is because I think it has lost the fine quality it held in the first couple of seasons. But the  more current seasons don't ruin the first one. Nothing could. There were so many fine moments, it would be hard to keep track of them to list them all. But just to name a few: the episode that is a take-off of ""The Breakfast Club""; the beauty pageant episode where Dawson finally notices Joey's beauty; the episode that foreshadowed the future pairing between Joey and Pacey (in my opinion, the REAL soul-mates); etc., etc., etc. Must I go on?I am so glad that this is finally coming out on DVD. I will admit, I am a little ashamed to admit how excited I am about it, since the show is no longer considered cool. But remember when it was? I do, that's why this DVD WILL BE MINE.",5,Remember When This Show Was Good?,1045008000,"02 12, 2003",2003,2287,"['do.I', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'WB', 'back', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'WB', 'cable', 'service', ""'d"", 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'seeing', 'imagine', 'how', 'happy', 'was', 'when', 'UPN', 'started', 'playing', 'episodes', 'was', 'had', 'answered', 'prayers', 'immediately', 'fell', 'love', 'was', 'nothing', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'before', 'Beautiful', 'kids', 'cruising', 'around', 'high', 'school', 'spouting', 'big', 'words', 'clever', 'phrases', 'other', 'had', 'inspiring', 'filmmaker', 'Dawson', 'tomboy', 'best', 'friend', 'Joey', 'Joey', 'was', 'so', 'sweet', 'so', 'beautiful', 'Dawson', 'sight', 'was', 'set', 'new', 'girl', 'New', 'York', 'Jen', 'Then', 'was', 'Pacey', 'slacker', 'group', 'who', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'as', 'smart', 'rest', 'still', 'liked', 'use', 'big', 'words', 'Put', 'together', 'get', 'one', 'best', 'first', 'seasons', 'show.I', 'mean', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'sympathize', 'Joey', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'character', 'almost', 'wanted', 'reach', 'television', 'pat', 'Joey', 'shoulder', 'say', 'ok', ""'ll"", 'come', 'around', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'cool', 'are', 'Who', 'never', 'been', 'love', 'someone', 'who', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'Anyone', 'could', 'relate', 'Joey', 'Actually', 'anyone', 'could', 'relate', 'one', 'characters', 'beginning', 'were', 'believable', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'loved', 'wanted', 'be', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'show', 'well', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'think', 'lost', 'fine', 'quality', 'held', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'more', 'current', 'seasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'first', 'one', 'Nothing', 'could', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'fine', 'moments', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'list', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'episode', 'take-off', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'episode', 'where', 'Dawson', 'finally', 'Joey', 'beauty', 'episode', 'foreshadowed', 'future', 'pairing', 'Joey', 'Pacey', 'opinion', 'REAL', 'soul-mates', 'etc.', 'etc', 'Must', 'go', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'finally', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'will', 'admit', 'am', 'little', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'how', 'excited', 'am', 'show', 'longer', 'considered', 'cool', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'do', 'why', 'DVD', 'WILL', 'BE', 'MINE']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete First Season

737764,AU84JL8P3AQLE,B00008AOX3,Big Daniel McFoot,"[7, 17]","Usually, TV shows get better with time.  With Dawson's Creek, I have to say it's the opposite.  Season One was so unpredictable, with witty jokes, and now I think it is a little ridiculous.I have watched Dawson's Creek from the beginning and I have to say although things have changed the show always seems to go back to where it was before. By saying this, I mainly mean Joey and Dawson. I think everyone has had enough of this story and it has caused many people to switch off from this show. Aother thing which annoys me about this show is that Joey has slept with all of the boys apart from Jack because of the obvious reason, that he is gay. Jen is the worst who hasn't she slept with. It isn't a very good example for teenagers and also they don't look like teenagers.Joey Potter-She is the good girl, very innocent, or so she thinks. Over the years they have tried to make her a bit of a rebel also every male who walks past her likes her but it doesn't work because of the way she is. She is the smart one of the group from Cape town. She has been friends with Dawson since a very young age and so through out the many series' they have been on and off. She is not much of a role model, I think she is a very weak character, she never does anything adventurous and always has to do everyhing right, she should live life on the wild side for a change. She was never very girly in the beginning of the how but now she is a mature young woman. Her father is in jail and also her mother died so her only family that we see is her older sister. Now as the series has moved on we have now seen her move from high school to college now where she is doing well and where she became friends with Audrey.Dawson Leery-I never really got why the show was named after Dawson because personally I hate him I think he is the most dull teenager ever and I feel he has no change in his life he just stays the same. The show isn't really based on him and without him in the episodes the show is a lot better, without his problems. In the current series' his father has died and his mother has had a baby. He is another person who is very intelligent and he is interested in the film industry being a director. He has loved Joey for ages but in the past he has had problems falling out with friends over her. When Pacey went out with her that caused a huge argument because Dawson used to go out with her and since Pacey was his best friend he felt it was wrong that his best friend should date his ex. He also hurt Joey in the last series by going out with Jen and then losing his virginity with her causing a huge argument between Jen and Joey. There are lots of arguments in this show but they are a close group of teenagers.Pacey Witter-The cool guy in the group always flirting with the girls and getting through tricky situations by talking his way out of them. I think Pacey is a really good character and he is strong, many storylines can be made about him and he is never as weak or boring as Dawson. He doesn't take life too seriously and lives it as every day goes by. We never see Pacey's family much either I can't quite remember why this is. He used to date Jack's sister Andie for a while but then she slept with someone else. She left the show because she had mental problems. He then had a thing with Jen but then fell in love with Joey which lasted for a while too. Now in the current episodes he dates Joey's college room mate Audrey, they are a perfect couple and look cute together they are also both wild and have the same sort of personality, so they get on well.Jen Lindley-The mature girl of the group who is very sexually active and knew all the facts of life before everyone else. She is 'easy' and is not much of a girly girl quite a tomboy and rebel. She never keeps in her mind what she thinks and lets it all out. She used to work on the college radio for a while giving advice to students with problems and helping them out with advice. She was thrown out of her parents house and so she lived with her grandma who is like a grandma to all of the group. They stay at her house when they want and she is good to them. She is now best friends with Jack I think she understands that he is gay and maybe the fact she can have a male friend who she knows isn't attracted to her. She has been out with Dawson, Pacey but not Jack. She also has had many boyfriends quite different personalities.",5,Twice as good as the new series,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",2003,4408,"['Usually', 'TV', 'shows', 'get', 'better', 'time', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'have', 'say', 'opposite', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'so', 'unpredictable', 'witty', 'jokes', 'now', 'think', 'little', 'ridiculous.I', 'have', 'watched', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'beginning', 'have', 'say', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'show', 'always', 'go', 'back', 'where', 'was', 'saying', 'mainly', 'mean', 'Joey', 'Dawson', 'think', 'everyone', 'had', 'enough', 'story', 'caused', 'many', 'people', 'switch', 'off', 'show', 'Aother', 'thing', 'show', 'Joey', 'slept', 'boys', 'apart', 'Jack', 'obvious', 'reason', 'gay', 'Jen', 'worst', 'who', ""n't"", 'slept', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'example', 'teenagers', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'teenagers.Joey', 'Potter-She', 'good', 'girl', 'very', 'innocent', 'so', 'years', 'have', 'tried', 'make', 'bit', 'rebel', 'also', 'male', 'who', 'likes', ""n't"", 'work', 'because', 'way', 'smart', 'one', 'group', 'Cape', 'town', 'been', 'friends', 'Dawson', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'so', 'out', 'many', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'much', 'role', 'model', 'think', 'very', 'weak', 'character', 'never', 'anything', 'adventurous', 'always', 'do', 'everyhing', 'right', 'should', 'live', 'life', 'wild', 'side', 'change', 'was', 'never', 'very', 'girly', 'beginning', 'how', 'now', 'mature', 'young', 'woman', 'father', 'jail', 'also', 'mother', 'died', 'so', 'only', 'family', 'see', 'older', 'sister', 'Now', 'series', 'moved', 'have', 'now', 'seen', 'move', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'now', 'where', 'doing', 'well', 'where', 'became', 'friends', 'Audrey.Dawson', 'Leery-I', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'named', 'Dawson', 'personally', 'hate', 'think', 'most', 'dull', 'teenager', 'ever', 'feel', 'change', 'life', 'just', 'same', 'show', ""n't"", 'really', 'based', 'episodes', 'show', 'lot', 'better', 'problems', 'current', 'series', 'father', 'died', 'mother', 'had', 'baby', 'person', 'who', 'very', 'intelligent', 'interested', 'film', 'industry', 'being', 'director', 'loved', 'Joey', 'ages', 'past', 'had', 'problems', 'falling', 'out', 'friends', 'When', 'Pacey', 'went', 'out', 'caused', 'huge', 'argument', 'Dawson', 'used', 'go', 'out', 'Pacey', 'was', 'best', 'friend', 'felt', 'was', 'wrong', 'best', 'friend', 'should', 'date', 'ex', 'also', 'hurt', 'Joey', 'last', 'series', 'going', 'out', 'Jen', 'then', 'losing', 'virginity', 'causing', 'huge', 'argument', 'Jen', 'Joey', 'are', 'lots', 'arguments', 'show', 'are', 'close', 'group', 'teenagers.Pacey', 'Witter-The', 'cool', 'guy', 'group', 'always', 'flirting', 'girls', 'getting', 'tricky', 'situations', 'talking', 'way', 'think', 'Pacey', 'really', 'good', 'character', 'strong', 'many', 'storylines', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'never', 'weak', 'boring', 'Dawson', ""n't"", 'take', 'life', 'too', 'seriously', 'day', 'never', 'see', 'Pacey', 'family', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'remember', 'why', 'used', 'date', 'Jack', 'sister', 'Andie', 'while', 'then', 'slept', 'someone', 'else', 'left', 'show', 'had', 'mental', 'problems', 'then', 'had', 'thing', 'Jen', 'then', 'fell', 'love', 'Joey', 'lasted', 'while', 'too', 'Now', 'current', 'episodes', 'Joey', 'college', 'room', 'mate', 'Audrey', 'are', 'perfect', 'couple', 'look', 'cute', 'together', 'are', 'also', 'wild', 'have', 'same', 'sort', 'personality', 'get', 'well.Jen', 'Lindley-The', 'mature', 'girl', 'group', 'who', 'very', 'sexually', 'active', 'knew', 'facts', 'life', 'everyone', 'else', ""'easy"", 'not', 'much', 'girly', 'girl', 'quite', 'tomboy', 'rebel', 'never', 'mind', 'what', 'out', 'used', 'work', 'college', 'radio', 'while', 'giving', 'advice', 'students', 'problems', 'helping', 'out', 'advice', 'was', 'thrown', 'parents', 'house', 'so', 'lived', 'grandma', 'who', 'grandma', 'group', 'stay', 'house', 'when', 'want', 'good', 'now', 'best', 'friends', 'Jack', 'think', 'gay', 'maybe', 'fact', 'can', 'have', 'male', 'friend', 'who', ""n't"", 'attracted', 'been', 'out', 'Dawson', 'Pacey', 'not', 'Jack', 'also', 'had', 'many', 'boyfriends', 'quite', 'different', 'personalities']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete First Season

In part because of just plain bad shows like Happily Ever After and 7th Heaven, but mainly because I dismissed the teen dramas the WB is known for (and which Dawson's Creek is the poster child for) as silly soap operas. In fact, even after starting to watch some of the WB's ""teen dramas"", I still sneered at the Creek, which continued to seem pretentious and silly.Then the WB reran the series premeire, and I watched. And quickly enjoyed, to the point of yelling at Dawson for being so dense, and Joey for not kicking Jen's butt for ""stealing"" Dawson. So, now interested in what happened next, I bought the Season 1 DVD set.The episodes are very good, and the core four-Dawson, Joey, Pacey, and Jen-are genuinely likable (if flawed) characters. Additionally, the supporting and recurring characters (Dawson's parents, Gail and Mitch; Joey's sister, Bessie; Grams; Pacey's brother, ""Deputy Doug"", and father; Joey's father; and Capeside's resident ice queen, Abby Morgan) add nicely to the main cast, providing more than a little bit of conflict along the way.The extras, while a bit sparse, are informative, but don't even begin to illustrate the hype that once existed with Dawson's Creek.

Essentially, this is a witty drama about childhood friends who are at the age where they start noticing the opposite sex. Not only did the writers give the characters good material to work with, but I have to admit that Katie Holmes is drop dead gorgeous. But what makes Holmes such a good actress is she can do so much more than just deliver the dialogue. Holmes is so good at facial expressions, biting her lip or looking up with her puppy eyes. Pacey offers some great comical relief. I found myself at times tearing up, only to be laughing a few seconds later. Who wasn't nearly in tears at the end of the pilot, only to burst out laughing at the ""Usually in the morning, with Katie Couric"" from Dawson. I challange anyone who watches the pilot not to sit down and watch the rest of the season. I would highly reccomend the first season of Dawson's Creek.There is one other more personal reason why I love this show. When I found the show on TBS, I was suffering from depression. This show did something to me, changed me in some way. It broke through and touched my heart.My only complaint is I wish their was a widescreen version, with a picture that utilizes all the resolution DVD's can give. And more extra's. I liked the two 8 minute mini-shows on the disc, but I would have loved an hour with the cast, and a behind the scenes special feature which showed out takes.

I think Kevin Williamson, the writer of Scream's talent was wasted on this show. He had a suspense show that was more his style that was only on the WB for only like 5 weeks. I wish that lasted longer than Dawson's Creek.I find the show way too mushy and the dialogue to be completely unrealistic, I mean what teenager uses such big words ? The show does have some moving moments and it does have a fast paced engery too it as well despite being a drama series. Sitting through the opening credits is torture though lol. If a [criminal] is ever caught, to get him to talk the best way is to play the theme song to this show. The best thing about the show is the always cute and charming Katie Holmes as Joey Potter. James Vander Beek is annoying as Dawson. He's always whining or jealous about something. I don't know if he's like that anymore though because I only watch the show once in a blue moon when nothing is on other than American Idle lol. Anyway Joshua Jackson and Michelle Williams are also good, it's just Dawson I can't stand, lol. I'm not sure if anyone would actually wanna go back and watch the old episodes of this show.

737786,A285Y6MRU4GH9,B00008AOX3,Joecool,"[13, 17]","This is an absolute classic season of television and should go down as a momentous event in American History.  What really drives it is Dawson and Joey's relationship.  Dawson's infatuation with Jen causes him not to see the forest through the trees, but hopefully true love shall prevail.  Their history, growing up as best friends, their innocence, living in a town sheltered from the harsh realities of the world, and their love, life meaning nothing without each other, all which rarely come together in real life are captured in this magnificent season.Season One took the magic of the Wonder Years, combined it with the drama of Beverly Hills 90210, and kept it emotional.  However, Wonder Years and 90210 got better as the series went on, whereas Dawson's Creek peaked in its first season and seldom had any more episodes of this caliber.  At least there is less wait since this is the first release.  Note to DC writers: the series failed with Joey falling for Pacey's whole `feel sorry for me' routine to get her in bed and then dump her, which was a complete insult to her character.  However in season one she has more sense and he goes after a less innocent and older character, Ms. Jacobs, with very entertaining results.  Thankfully, Wonder Years did not have Paul sleep with Winnie or it may have suffered a similar fate.For those who criticize this show based on commercials, watch the Pilot episode.  And if you still don't like it, than go back to 3rd Rock, Everybody Loves Raymond, or whatever's winning the grammys.The DVD with digital quality picture and sound should nicely complement the already unlimited replay value of Dawson's Creek.  So pick this up ASAP, and Season Two when it comes out for the first few episodes and Rachael Leigh Cook's all too few appearances.",5,The Single Best Season on Television Ever!,1043971200,"01 31, 2003",2003,1793,"['absolute', 'classic', 'season', 'television', 'should', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'momentous', 'event', 'American', 'History', 'What', 'really', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'relationship', 'Dawson', 'infatuation', 'Jen', 'not', 'see', 'forest', 'trees', 'hopefully', 'true', 'love', 'shall', 'prevail', 'history', 'growing', 'up', 'best', 'friends', 'innocence', 'living', 'town', 'sheltered', 'harsh', 'realities', 'world', 'love', 'life', 'meaning', 'nothing', 'other', 'rarely', 'come', 'together', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'captured', 'magnificent', 'season.Season', 'One', 'took', 'magic', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'combined', 'drama', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'kept', 'emotional', 'However', 'Wonder', 'Years', '90210', 'got', 'better', 'series', 'went', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'peaked', 'first', 'season', 'seldom', 'had', 'more', 'episodes', 'caliber', 'least', 'less', 'wait', 'first', 'release', 'Note', 'DC', 'writers', 'series', 'failed', 'Joey', 'falling', 'Pacey', 'whole', 'feel', 'sorry', 'routine', 'get', 'bed', 'then', 'dump', 'was', 'complete', 'insult', 'character', 'However', 'season', 'one', 'more', 'sense', 'less', 'innocent', 'older', 'character', 'Ms.', 'Jacobs', 'very', 'entertaining', 'results', 'Thankfully', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'Paul', 'sleep', 'Winnie', 'may', 'have', 'suffered', 'similar', 'fate.For', 'who', 'criticize', 'show', 'based', 'commercials', 'watch', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'go', 'back', '3rd', 'Rock', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'winning', 'grammys.The', 'DVD', 'digital', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'should', 'nicely', 'complement', 'already', 'unlimited', 'replay', 'value', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'So', 'pick', 'up', 'ASAP', 'Season', 'Two', 'when', 'out', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'too', 'few', 'appearances']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete First Season
737787,A385C064Y38OFK,B00008AOX3,"John Dagley ""RonHowardFan@hotmail.com""","[2, 3]","The year is 1998. For eight years Beverly Hills 90210 had been the hottest address on the box. Creator Darren Star had really taken a shine to school life for teenagers. It would take another two years at the dawn of the new millennium, when 90210 no longer felt like home and viewers wanted to expand their viewing options, and move out to a different location. It was 1998 when Darren Star would again put a twinkle in every man's eye with `Sex and the City', but this time with a group of woman's adult perspectives on dating and life in New York City. You heard right. `Sex and the City' - A candy confection with class for girls and guys to go all gooey over, either dating, or cuddling up on the couch each week with married couples.However, 1998 was also the year television viewers took a vested interest in the seemingly simple lives of four close knit friends in the coastal town of Capeside. Away from the city, we find solace in a creek. It was in this setting when creator Kevin Williamson posed this very intriguing question""CAN FOUR FRIENDS GROW UP WITHOUT GROWING APART?"" That happened to spark the imagination of millions everywhere and give hope to lovelorn teenagers. Enter Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beck), a purely romantic, movie making dreamer, with an optimism to capture any girls' heart, but also a tendencyto blurt out inappropriate dialogue at a seconds notice withoutcontemplation.Then zoom in on childhood friend and neighbour Joey Potter (Katie Holmes), who lives across a creek that is Dawson's whole world. A world Dawson seems forever lost in if it wasn't for Joey's regular routine of rowing from her dock to Dawson's, then climbing in through the window instead of the door,and just enjoying each others company on Dawson's bed, watching movies late into the night, before saying goodnight and innocently sharing the same bed together.It is then that the series of Dawson's Creek begins with the realisation from Joey that her body is changing. She is getting breasts that were never there before. Puberty has arrived and you'll go through thirteen aptly numbered episodes to signify the beginning of teenage life. Thirteen - A chance to see life at age fifteen through four different sets of eyes.When life couldn't possibly get more confusing, along comes Jennifer Lindley (Michelle Williams) out of a bright yellow taxi cab, just like off the streets of New York, where she's come to start a whole new life on the creek. With all eyes in her direction Dawson and his friend Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson), are in awe of this heavenly earth-bound angel beauty, with legs for miles and a seductive dancing wind playing at her skirt, which suggests more delights on offer that would raise anyone's eyebrows and keep any young teenagers heart all a flutter.If this is not enough to comprehend add to the mix the parents of Dawson, Gail Leery (Mary Margaret Humes), and Mitch Leery (John Wesley Shipp) and their healthy sex lives. Jen's church conscious grandmother Evelyn ""Grams"" Ryan (Mary Beth Peil). Then to round it all off we have Joey's sister Bessie Potter (Nina Repeta), to deal with any family issues.So there we have a basis for the fun filled episodes to come. With even more characters to come in the six seasons that followed Dawson's Creek debut.Fans and new comers to this show will find hot storylines between a teacher and student.There is a Beauty Contest episode that raises worldwide alarm bells for parents everywhere after the chilling murder of JonBenet Ramsey Boxing Day 1996. Any beauty contest episode harks back at me to this event. Felicity season four does the same with the episode ""Miss Conception"" and Felicity's participation in a beauty pageant, as well as a lot of other maternal feelings in me. You'll also find lovable Noel (Scott Foley) from the 1999 debut of Felicity in Dawson's Creek as Cliff in a number of fun episodes.There is an awesome episode that wouldn't be like a real school without Detention, inspired by John Hughes The Breakfast Club. We also get to meet in my opinion the devilishly sexy, but totally lovable trouble maker Abby Morgan (Monica Keena). I can't help but always get lost in the deep depths of Abby's eyes... A character better explored in season two.No teenage show would be accurate without the importance of a Road Trip. A topic explored more in Felicity. Plus it wouldn't be right of Kevin Williamson with such film writing hits as the Scream trilogy and I Know What You Did Last Summer, not to have The Scare episode.Decisions are what life is all about and so is a fitting final to a very short first season of Dawson's Creek. The shortest season I've ever seen!Dawson's Creek starts and continues in season two. Oddly enough, there is no Freshman year for these young teens that we are able to see. So I think a Freshman year prequel story could be just what fan fiction creek fans need.Having never really seen this show properly until DVD, and debating over whether or not to watch it since first owning and loving Felicity, I can say things only get better for the Dawson Creek gang.Dawson's Creek does have a L.M Montgomery Anne of Green Gables feel about it to me, especially when it comes to the relationship between Jen and Grams. I also know from seeing fleeting episodes or parts of shows, that Michelle Williams would be my favourite character.What we will see is how cleverly so many characters intertwine and change over the six season run of Dawson Creek, and the important issues that face any young person at some time in their lives. It is so great to know we can go to TV shows for answers that we might not know the answers to for guidance. It is a mixture of great storylines and real honest feelings thatmake this show, and others memorable. Few could match the quality of Dawson's Creek. The level of sophistication in the dialogue and open discussion of sexuality is refreshing to see, and something I admire. It always leaves us hoping that one day we can all be so comfortable with ourselves that we'll know we won't get judged by others, or potentially those we love. That only comes with time and all a part of growing up. That's what Dawson's Creek is here to discuss and that's why it will remain special for years to come.",5,Dawson's Creek Season One,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,6260,"['year', '1998', 'eight',

737791,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00008AOX3,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","I managed to avoid watching ""Dawson's Creek"" until the gang graduated from high school; students in my Popular Culture class always want to write about the show for their television unit so I had to get with the program.  That means that when the first season finally became available that I already know that the title character is going to make it through his high school years with his virginity intact.  Consequently, watching the first season of the series that was created by Kevin Williamson and which put the WB on the map is not about the big question of whether or not Dawson is going to (and if he does with whom).  Basically it is about a group of high school sophomores struggling to maintain their relationships despite their almost constant attempts to destroy those self-same relationships.The secret to enjoying ""Dawson's Creek"" is to realize that Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek) is the least interesting member of the core group.  This is not to say that he is boring, but when the entire series starts with him coaxing Joey Potter (Katie Holmes) into his bed because they always sleep together on movie night while remaining oblivious to the fact that the girl across the Creek is (a) in love with him and (b) a righteous babe, it is clear that this guy does not have a clue.  Throughout the first season Dawson pretty much revalidates that idea at each and every opportunity, especially once ""new girl"" Jen Lindley (Michelle Williams) literally moves next door.  Meanwhile, loveable loser Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson) is putting the moves on Tamara Jacobs (Leann Hunley), the gang's new English teacher.  This last aspect becomes the proverbial exception that proves the rule because otherwise this coming of age drama would, rather ironically, be about teenagers NOT having sex.  In that regard it almost seems like Williamson was trying to come up with a sexual generation-gap show in the grand tradition of ""Family Ties,"" because in that regard Dawon's parents are embarrassing their son to death.  But then it turns out his mother (Mary-Margaret Humes) has been having an affair and once his father (John Wesley Shipp) gets to the last person to know stage the destruction of the young Leery's psyche is just about complete.  Besides, in the final insult to injury, he only gets to audit his school's film class.The first season finds Dawson pursuing Jen, but the heart of that season is Joey's transformation from tomboy to potential Miss Windjammer, which reaches its high point when she sings ""On My Own"" in Episode 111, ""Beauty Contest.""  The soul of the first season is clearly Pacey, who can never believe that he is as charming as he really happens to be; even at this early stage of the game there is a clear suggestion that he and Joey are kindred spirits.  Not surprisingly given who created the show, the best episode in this collection turns out to be ""The Scare"" (Episode 109), which has Dawson pulling out his bag of tricks to scare the gang on Friday the 13th.  The characters are likeable, the scripts are halfway literate, and the fact that Dawson and Joey reminds me of Anne Shirley being oblivious to the fact that she and Gilbert Blythe are going to live happily ever after is not a bad thing for ""Dawson's Creek"" to have going for it either.  The DVD extras are halfway decent as well, with a retrospective featurette and some commentary from Williamson and executive producer Paul Stupin.",4,"Joey likes Dawson, but Dawson likes Jen, and Pacey...",1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,3437,"['managed', 'avoid', 'watching', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'gang', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'Popular', 'Culture', 'class', 'always', 'want', 'write', 'show', 'television', 'unit', 'had', 'get', 'program', 'when', 'first', 'season', 'finally', 'became', 'available', 'already', 'know', 'title', 'character', 'going', 'make', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'virginity', 'intact', 'Consequently', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'was', 'created', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'put', 'WB', 'map', 'not', 'big', 'question', 'not', 'Dawson', 'going', 'whom', 'Basically', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'sophomores', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'relationships', 'almost', 'constant', 'attempts', 'destroy', 'self-same', 'relationships.The', 'secret', 'enjoying', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'realize', 'Dawson', 'Leery', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'least', 'interesting', 'member', 'core', 'group', 'not', 'say', 'boring', 'when', 'entire', 'series', 'coaxing', 'Joey', 'Potter', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'bed', 'always', 'sleep', 'together', 'movie', 'night', 'remaining', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'girl', 'Creek', 'love', 'b', 'righteous', 'babe', 'clear', 'guy', 'not', 'have', 'clue', 'first', 'season', 'Dawson', 'pretty', 'much', 'revalidates', 'idea', 'opportunity', 'especially', 'once', 'new', 'girl', 'Jen', 'Lindley', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'literally', 'next', 'door', 'Meanwhile', 'loveable', 'loser', 'Pacey', 'Witter', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'putting', 'moves', 'Tamara', 'Jacobs', 'Leann', 'Hunley', 'gang', 'new', 'English', 'teacher', 'last', 'aspect', 'proverbial', 'exception', 'rule', 'otherwise', 'coming', 'age', 'drama', 'would', 'rather', 'ironically', 'be', 'teenagers', 'NOT', 'having', 'sex', 'regard', 'almost', 'Williamson', 'was', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'sexual', 'generation-gap', 'show', 'grand', 'tradition', 'Family', 'Ties', 'regard', 'Dawon', 'parents', 'are', 'embarrassing', 'son', 'death', 'then', 'out', 'mother', 'Mary-Margaret', 'Humes', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'once', 'father', 'John', 'Wesley', 'Shipp', 'last', 'person', 'know', 'stage', 'destruction', 'young', 'Leery', 'psyche', 'just', 'about', 'complete', 'Besides', 'final', 'insult', 'injury', 'only', 'audit', 'school', 'film', 'class.The', 'first', 'season', 'Dawson', 'pursuing', 'Jen', 'heart', 'season', 'Joey', 'transformation', 'tomboy', 'potential', 'Miss', 'Windjammer', 'high', 'point', 'when', 'My', 'Own', 'Episode', '111', 'Beauty', 'Contest', 'soul', 'first', 'season', 'clearly', 'Pacey', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'believe', 'as', 'charming', 'really', 'be', 'even', 'early', 'stage', 'game', 'clear', 'suggestion', 'Joey', 'are', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'given', 'who', 'created', 'show', 'best', 'episode', 'collection', 'out', 'be', 'Scare', 'Episode', '109', 'Dawson', 'pulling', 'out', 'bag', 'tricks', 'scare', 'gang', 'Friday', '13th', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'scripts', 'are', 'halfway', 'literate', 'fact', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'being', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'Gilbert', 'Blythe', 'are', 'going', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'have', 'going', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'halfway', 'decent', 'as', 'well', 'retrospective', 'featurette', 'commentary', 'Williamson', 'executive', 'producer', 'Paul', 'Stupin']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete First Season

No offense to fans of Freaks and Geeks and My So-Called Life (I love those shows too) but DC never had respect from critics or most of the general public. Most have called it another take off of Beverly Hills 90210. I dare you to watch the first two episodes of the first season and say that again. Of course the show was not realistic but I think it was brave enough to not try and be (that awful word) realistic. The show was about dreams and fantasies that we all have when we are young and the show actually made us feel like our dreams had come true, even if it was only for 45 minutes an episode.Dawson Leery is a young filmmaker who worships Steven Spielberg and is trying to cope with growing up (and people telling him to grow up). He brings a natural sensitivity that is rare in most characters in teen shows. He brings a kindness and innocence and of course, he's lost, tortured and uncertain about where he stands in a world that's unfair and cruel. ""I'm going to be a filmmaker. It's my life's ambition, it always has been"". This is his exact words in the pilot episode and by season 3, he is faced with harsh realities that he questions his passion and eventually, he gives up. Of course by the end of season 4, he finds inspiration again to work towards his dream from the help of a bitter old man who was once a filmmaker and gave up too. He also finds the subject for the film that eventually gets him recognition.Of course, the show deals with love, loss, angst and sometimes it even gets to the point of absurdity but it never stays far from the truth of our own fears when we are that age. Some episodes could be ridiculous which is why most say that ""Of all the shows that captured what being a teenager is really like, Dawson's Creek was not it"". True, it did get a little over the top by season 3 but it always stayed true to its subjects and themes. That being young is hard and we never know what will happen to us in life. This is Dawson's journey and same with the other characters on the show. Hearts are broken, people lose trust in each other, we don't always win and even some people lose their lives. It may not portray it in the most, as you say, realistic way but it wasn't trying to be completely accurate, it was trying to inspire us to not give up on our dreams and passions.",5,Life's unexpected journey.,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,2378,"['Dawson', 'Creek', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'appreciated', 'show', 'history', 'offense', 'fans', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'My', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'love', 'shows', 'too', 'DC', 'never', 'had', 'respect', 'critics', 'most', 'general', 'public', 'Most', 'have', 'called', 'take', 'off', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'dare', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'say', 'again', 'course', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'realistic', 'think', 'was', 'brave', 'enough', 'not', 'try', 'be', 'awful', 'word', 'realistic', 'show', 'was', 'dreams', 'fantasies', 'have', 'when', 'are', 'young', 'show', 'actually', 'made', 'feel', 'dreams', 'had', 'come', 'true', 'even', 'was', 'only', '45', 'minutes', 'episode.Dawson', 'Leery', 'young', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'trying', 'cope', 'growing', 'up', 'people', 'telling', 'grow', 'up', 'natural', 'sensitivity', 'rare', 'most', 'characters', 'teen', 'shows', 'kindness', 'innocence', 'course', 'lost', 'tortured', 'uncertain', 'where', 'world', 'unfair', 'cruel', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'filmmaker', 'life', 'ambition', 'always', 'been', 'exact', 'words', 'pilot', 'episode', 'season', '3', 'faced', 'harsh', 'realities', 'questions', 'passion', 'eventually', 'up', 'course', 'end', 'season', '4', 'inspiration', 'again', 'work', 'towards', 'dream', 'help', 'bitter', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'filmmaker', 'gave', 'up', 'too', 'also', 'subject', 'film', 'eventually', 'recognition.Of', 'course', 'show', 'love', 'loss', 'angst', 'even', 'point', 'absurdity', 'never', 'far', 'truth', 'own', 'fears', 'when', 'are', 'age', 'episodes', 'could', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'why', 'most', 'say', 'shows', 'captured', 'what', 'being', 'teenager', 'really', 'like', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'was', 'not', 'True', 'did', 'get', 'little', 'top', 'season', '3', 'always', 'stayed', 'true', 'subjects', 'themes', 'being', 'young', 'hard', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'life', 'Dawson', 'journey', 'same', 'other', 'characters', 'show', 'Hearts', 'are', 'broken', 'people', 'lose', 'trust', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'win', 'even', 'people', 'lose', 'lives', 'may', 'not', 'portray', 'most', 'say', 'realistic', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'completely', 'accurate', 'was', 'trying', 'inspire', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'dreams', 'passions']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete First Season

737800,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00008AOX3,P Magnum,"[11, 12]","Dawson's Creek just completed its six-year run on the WB and the first season was recently released on dvd.  The show was the creation of Kevin Williamson, who at the time of the show's debut in January, 1998 was riding high thanks to the success of his writing efforts on Scream 1 & 2 and I Know What You Did Last Summer.  The show revolved around four teenagers (two boys & two girls) in the fictional Massachusetts town of Capeside.  The show's four leads were played by unknowns.  James Van Der Beek plays the title role of Dawson Leery, a sensitive film buff, whose dream is to be a big Hollywood director.  Katie Holmes is Joey Potter, Dawson's friend since they were five and is innocent, yet hardened because of the death of her mother and her father being incarcerated.  Joey begins to realize that she has feelings for Dawson beyond just friendship and the ebbs and flows of their relationship is what the entire run of the series would be based on.  Joshua Jackson is Pacey Whitter, Dawson's best friend and lovable screw-up, who creates a potential major controversy by having an affair with one of his teachers.  Michelle Williams is Jen Lindley, a bad girl from New York City who is set to Capeside to live with her Grandmother (Mary Beth Peil) who lives next door to Dawson.  Jen provides a spark in the group dynamic as Dawson is attracted to her and will take her out which sparks jealousy in Joey.  The show is quite different from your average teenage high school drama.  The characters dealt with real issues like Dawson's mother's infidelity and the break up of his parent's marriage and the confused feelings of love that all teenagers feel.  The characters didn't speak in regular high schooler lingo and were incredibly self-analytical, almost clinical breaking down their emotions.  The show is a bit wordy, but the young actors are all fresh and new and bring a charming naivete to their roles.  All four lead characters would become instant teen idols and the show's success single handedly saved the floundering WB network which was considering folding until Dawson's Creek exploded with audiences.",4,Start Of The Creek,1053043200,"05 16, 2003",2003,2126,"['Dawson', 'Creek', 'just', 'completed', 'six-year', 'run', 'WB', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'dvd', 'show', 'was', 'creation', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'who', 'time', 'show', 'debut', 'January', '1998', 'was', 'riding', 'high', 'thanks', 'success', 'writing', 'efforts', 'Scream', '1', '2', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'show', 'revolved', 'four', 'teenagers', 'two', 'boys', 'two', 'girls', 'fictional', 'Massachusetts', 'town', 'Capeside', 'show', 'four', 'leads', 'were', 'played', 'unknowns', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'title', 'role', 'Dawson', 'Leery', 'sensitive', 'film', 'buff', 'dream', 'be', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Joey', 'Potter', 'Dawson', 'friend', 'were', 'five', 'innocent', 'yet', 'hardened', 'death', 'mother', 'father', 'being', 'incarcerated', 'Joey', 'realize', 'feelings', 'Dawson', 'just', 'friendship', 'ebbs', 'flows', 'relationship', 'what', 'entire', 'run', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'based', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'Pacey', 'Whitter', 'Dawson', 'best', 'friend', 'lovable', 'screw-up', 'who', 'potential', 'major', 'controversy', 'having', 'affair', 'one', 'teachers', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Jen', 'Lindley', 'bad', 'girl', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'who', 'set', 'Capeside', 'live', 'Grandmother', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Peil', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'Dawson', 'Jen', 'spark', 'group', 'Dawson', 'attracted', 'will', 'take', 'out', 'jealousy', 'Joey', 'show', 'quite', 'different', 'average', 'teenage', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'characters', 'dealt', 'real', 'issues', 'Dawson', 'mother', 'infidelity', 'break', 'parent', 'marriage', 'confused', 'feelings', 'love', 'teenagers', 'feel', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'regular', 'high', 'schooler', 'lingo', 'were', 'incredibly', 'self-analytical', 'almost', 'clinical', 'breaking', 'down', 'emotions', 'show', 'bit', 'wordy', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'fresh', 'new', 'bring', 'charming', 'naivete', 'roles', 'four', 'lead', 'characters', 'would', 'become', 'instant', 'teen', 'idols', 'show', 'success', 'single', 'handedly', 'saved', 'floundering', 'WB', 'network', 'was', 'considering', 'folding', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'exploded', 'audiences']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete First Season

I'm not a teenager anymore (I'm almost 30 y.o.), but I really believe every person who likes to watch TV programs with quality should give a chance for Dawson's Creek. This is one of the best TV shows ever made, with an incredible cast and a sensitive director. The plots were always great and it is a kind of surreal thing to see boys and girls, who are 15/17 years old, having arguments like people of my age now.As a true fan of the show, I must admit that this first season was not the best one. But you have to consider the first season is always a kind of lab, where show directors and producers are developing the main plot, presenting the characters and ""testing"" the show, to find out the viewers acceptance of it.On first season, Dawson finds out his home is not as perfect as he thought it was. Pacey discovers his own sexuality, having an affair with his school teacher. Jen arrives from New York, to live in Capeside with her grandmother, a very religious and severe woman, opposed to jen, who used to have a profane life in the big apple. Joey, sweet as always, becomes confused, when she starts to fall in love with her best childhood friend and neighboor, Dawson, who dates Jen, breaking Joey's heart.The first season reserves classical ""Dawson's Creek"" moments, such as the ""Detention"" episode,in which the interesting character Abby is presented and the gang stays stucked in school on a saturday, in a reference to the ""breakfast club"" movie. There's also the first season finale, with the kiss between Joey and Dawson, that every viewer was waiting since day one.

It enjoyed a hearty six-year run on the WB, boasting such trophies as first gay kiss (concerning Jack) and most famous virgin (Dawson, until - wow - the fifth season). In syndication it's doing fairly well. It's always going to be etched into the memory of America, mostly because of the parodies, but also because it was a plain good show, easy to relate to, with likable characters and the various situations the characters got themselves into. Oh, look, Dawson and Jen have a school project together, and they just broke up! And hey, what do you know, isn't it lucky that all the main characters have the same classes together all the time?The first season was fairly bland: thirteen episodes with a smattering of sexual tension, various embarrassing scenarios, a pregnancy, infidelity, and a new girl - all the building blocks necessary for a good New England-based teen melodrama. It took the pieces needed and worked with it, creating characters that are sometimes annoyingly Hollywood (in the sense that they deliver perfectly witty, adult-like monologues without taking a breath) but affable all the same. Their problems are ones you yourself might have had at fifteen, so sit back, relax, and dive into the creek - just know that other seasons have done better, in the sense of being just a wee bit more dangerous plotwise.",4,Teen drama at its best,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,1463,"['Ahh', 'DAWSON', 'CREEK', 'ultimate', 'fifteen-year-old', 'soap', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'teenagers', 'parents', 'country', 'enjoyed', 'hearty', 'six-year', 'run', 'WB', 'boasting', 'such', 'trophies', 'first', 'gay', 'kiss', 'concerning', 'Jack', 'most', 'famous', 'virgin', 'Dawson', 'wow', 'fifth', 'season', 'syndication', 'doing', 'fairly', 'well', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'etched', 'memory', 'America', 'mostly', 'parodies', 'also', 'was', 'plain', 'good', 'show', 'easy', 'relate', 'likable', 'characters', 'various', 'situations', 'characters', 'got', 'Oh', 'look', 'Dawson', 'Jen', 'have', 'school', 'project', 'together', 'just', 'broke', 'up', 'hey', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""n't"", 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'same', 'together', 'time', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'fairly', 'bland', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'smattering', 'sexual', 'tension', 'various', 'embarrassing', 'scenarios', 'pregnancy', 'infidelity', 'new', 'girl', 'building', 'blocks', 'necessary', 'good', 'New', 'England-based', 'teen', 'melodrama', 'took', 'pieces', 'needed', 'worked', 'creating', 'characters', 'are', 'sometimes', 'annoyingly', 'Hollywood', 'sense', 'deliver', 'perfectly', 'witty', 'adult-like', 'monologues', 'taking', 'breath', 'affable', 'same', 'problems', 'are', 'ones', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'fifteen', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'dive', 'creek', 'just', 'know', 'other', 'seasons', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'sense', 'being', 'just', 'wee', 'bit', 'more', 'dangerous', 'plotwise']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete First Season

I enjoyed the show and was very drawn into the characters and the plot of the series. Due to my work schedule the last two season's 5 & 6 were hit and miss for me, i didnt get to see them all, and i missed the two hour series finale. now in my mid 30's  I decided to revisit this show and complete watching the entire season. So i ordered them all and just finished watching season one today. My opinion, I can now reflect back and see how i was drawn into this series, Alas i have matured in the past 14-15 years and what was once a edge of the seat weekly event for me is now a little dull.. DONT MISTAKE ME, i still enjoyed watching season one this week, its just lost some of its luster from my younger years. I can see huge holes in the plot and some of the acting is underdone/overdone..yet still entertaining. I was truly hopeing to recapture the magic of when this show first aired.  If you can put aside your grown-up reasoning and just re-think like a 16 year old this show will delight you.. I dont want to be too harsh, its still a fun show to follow and thats why im giving it 4 stars, I still have the next 5 seasons to watch and the 2 hour ending, maybee my opinion will rise to five stars after getting to see it all..  but for now im ok turning it off and watching the news between episodes... 2 pennies.  OH the soundtrack is still awesome !!  i had a few of those goosebumps moments durring a few episodes with the music.. pretty cool.Update: Im going to put this out there (as if anyone truly cared about Amazon tv-series reviews) but here we go anyways,  I have all 6 seasons and season 1 is a little corny but it pulls you in. Season two hooks you pretty hard and you in for the long haul. Season three is pure energy and in my opinion the best Season of the series, season 4 is good up till about halfway through, then it falls on its face. The end of season 4 and all the way up till the last two episodes of season 6 are completel letdowns.. (But you must watch them to understand the 2 hour season finale) the last two episodes of season 6 are pretty good and as mentioned the finale is a tear jerker and a great way to finish the show.  I was sad at the end of the 2hr special just knowing there wasnt anymore.. Im not going to revisit this series yearly but im glad i own them. maybee every 5 years i will rewatch the series..",4,Its good but has lost some luster..,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,2440,"['was', 'late', 'teens/early', 'twentys', 'when', 'Dawsons', 'Creek', 'series', 'started', 'WB', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'drawn', 'characters', 'plot', 'series', 'Due', 'work', 'schedule', 'last', 'two', 'season', '5', '6', 'were', 'hit', 'miss', 'i', 'didnt', 'get', 'see', 'i', 'missed', 'two', 'hour', 'series', 'finale', 'now', 'mid', '30', 'decided', 'revisit', 'show', 'complete', 'watching', 'entire', 'season', 'i', 'ordered', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'season', 'one', 'today', 'opinion', 'can', 'now', 'reflect', 'back', 'see', 'how', 'i', 'was', 'drawn', 'series', 'Alas', 'i', 'have', 'matured', 'past', '14-15', 'years', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'edge', 'seat', 'weekly', 'event', 'now', 'little', 'dull..', 'DONT', 'MISTAKE', 'ME', 'i', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'season', 'one', 'week', 'just', 'lost', 'luster', 'younger', 'years', 'can', 'see', 'huge', 'holes', 'plot', 'acting', 'underdone/overdone..yet', 'still', 'entertaining', 'was', 'truly', 'hopeing', 'recapture', 'magic', 'when', 'show', 'first', 'aired', 'can', 'put', 'aside', 'grown-up', 'reasoning', 'just', 're-think', '16', 'year', 'old', 'show', 'will', 'delight', 'you..', 'dont', 'want', 'be', 'too', 'harsh', 'still', 'fun', 'show', 'follow', 'thats', 'why', 'im', 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'still', 'have', 'next', '5', 'seasons', 'watch', '2', 'hour', 'ending', 'maybee', 'opinion', 'will', 'rise', 'five', 'stars', 'getting', 'see', 'all..', 'now', 'im', 'turning', 'off', 'watching', 'news', 'episodes', '2', 'pennies', 'soundtrack', 'still', 'awesome', 'i', 'had', 'few', 'goosebumps', 'moments', 'durring', 'few', 'episodes', 'music..', 'pretty', 'cool.Update', 'Im', 'going', 'put', 'there', 'anyone', 'truly', 'cared', 'Amazon', 'tv-series', 'reviews', 'here', 'go', 'anyways', 'have', '6', 'seasons', 'season', '1', 'little', 'corny', 'Season', 'two', 'hooks', 'pretty', 'hard', 'long', 'haul', 'Season', 'three', 'pure', 'energy', 'opinion', 'best', 'Season', 'series', 'season', '4', 'good', 'up', 'till', 'halfway', 'then', 'face', 'end', 'season', '4', 'way', 'up', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', '6', 'are', 'completel', 'letdowns..', 'must', 'watch', 'understand', '2', 'hour', 'season', 'finale', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', '6', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'mentioned', 'finale', 'tear', 'jerker', 'great', 'way', 'finish', 'show', 'was', 'sad', 'end', '2hr', 'special', 'just', 'knowing', 'there', 'wasnt', 'anymore..', 'Im', 'not', 'going', 'revisit', 'series', 'yearly', 'im', 'glad', 'i', 'own', 'maybee', '5', 'years', 'i', 'will', 'rewatch', 'series..']",Dawson's Creek - The Complete First Season

They pushed the boundaries of acceptable content with teacher-student relationships, challenged us with teenagers who spoke like grad students, and gave us so many postmodern, intertextual references to 1980's pop culture that the show was as much fun for twenty-something adults as it was for kids going through puberty now. It was fresh, with unusual characters and storylines, and had enough unpredictability and pace to keep you engaged, all the while toying with the ""will-they-or-won't-they?"" Joey/Dawson relationship in the background. It was superb. Then came Season 3. Exit Kevin Williamson and enter the schmaltz - and it's been pretty much the same ever since. What once played like an adult's fond-yet-knowing fantasy of adolescence, now plays like an adolescent's woefully uninformed fantasy of adult life: a world in which Hollywood producers seek out aspiring student filmmakers; where downtrodden employees rise up and overthrow the boss; where impassioned speeches really do change people's hearts and minds; where having gay friends is cool, as long as we never actually see them kiss. It's like ""Seventh Heaven"" without God - unjustified by moral subtext, such mawkishness is horrific. While there are still rare moments of inspiration - like a devout grandmother taking a weekend fling in Vegas with her black boyfriend, or the brilliant one-liners Audrey is lucky enough to score most weeks - it's almost wholly degenerated into a sappy, lame and agonizing ritual for those left wondering if Joey and Dawson will ever end up together. But by now, does anyone really care?  For my part, I just fantasize about a series finale in which they're all drowned in the creek.

My mother had bought the DVD to watch with my sister and I had endured pleny of rave reviews so I figured why not.  I found myself giving it a try because I liked James Vander Beek and Katie Holmes in the various movies I had seen them in.  They are smart individuals and I was hoping they would transcend the usual teen genre.Unfortunately I was severly dissapointed.  I made it midway through episode three before I became disguted and frustrated.  The characters of Joey and Dawson are unique and refreshing in their ideals and thoghts but that is about the only good thing I can say about it.  The plots are ludicrous and filled with holes.  I noticed a few dispariging things right away.  First off, I can understand that everyone lives next to each other but the way everyone keeps running into each other is ridiculous.  For example in episode one when Pacey runs into Ms Jacobs on the dock in the middle of the night.  The dialogue is witty but it is unrealistic for 15 year olds.  Who talks like that?  The series revolves around who likes who which just gets old really quick.I don't understand why this got all the acclaim it did.  It was boring and contrived.  For a better stuff of a similar nature try My So Called Life.  This is done better and is less time involving.  For more originality try Buffy, which deals with the same issues yet manages to be much more interesting and entertaining.Bottom Line:  People who like watching annoying whiners deal with the same problems week after week should love this.

737814,A2GUVU889LA2O,B00008AOX3,"Woo Kim ""Woo S. Kim""","[3, 3]","Dawson's Creek is probably the second greatest teen drama series second only to 90210.  The first season argueably has the best episodes of the entire series.  Mainly because of the simple fact that season one deals with the struggles of growing up and realizing things like soul mates, love and self worth.  But also the fun stuff about young, hanging out with with your friends.  Watching films and throwing scractistic remarks at the television.  For me, personally I relate with Dawson and Joey's characters more then anything.  I relate with Joey because as of right now, I'm in love with my best friend and she doesn't see it, so I can relate to those feelings of frustation.  Also, I can relate to Dawson because I want to move to Miami or New York City to begin a film career and I'm a dreamer and also being critized by my best friend for that.  Now, as far as my title.  If anyone who has all six seasons and I'm not including the series finale because that I thought was very well done.  You will notice after season two which is the season that Kevin Williamson the creator of the series left the series.  The series slowly but surely ""tanks.""  The first two seasons, had emotional depth and scenes that even though they seemed like the ""filler"" scenes (or scenes being put in to fill up space in the episode) it still made sense and it had a point for the episode.  The episodes in seasons three through six.  Just seem really dull and with the exception of some episodes.  A parent's death in season four, an episode entitled ""the longest day"" in series three.  The series just seems really boring and drags on.  But if you want to see a series that reinvented the teen drama.
