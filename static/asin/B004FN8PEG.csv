1405169,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B004FN8PEG,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[4, 6]","I love Angelina Ballerina.  She is so cute and adorable and she always does the right thing, even it if takes awhile.  This DVD is full of five episodes all revolving around Angelina and her ballet dancing!  The DVD starts out with Angelina's family moving across town, which means new friends, a new school, and a new dance teacher.  Angelina lies to the school because she is nervous about the change, but in the end realizes it is going to be great.  I think this episode is great because I know how scary moving can be for kids and this shows how it can be a fun new adventure.  The other episodes are just as good and focus on Angelina and her little sister, her new dance teacher and school, and are all full of dancing and singing!",5,Cute and Adorable,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,738,"['love', 'Angelina', 'Ballerina', 'so', 'cute', 'adorable', 'always', 'right', 'thing', 'even', 'awhile', 'DVD', 'full', 'five', 'episodes', 'revolving', 'Angelina', 'ballet', 'dancing', 'DVD', 'out', 'Angelina', 'family', 'moving', 'town', 'new', 'friends', 'new', 'school', 'new', 'dance', 'teacher', 'Angelina', 'school', 'nervous', 'change', 'end', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'think', 'episode', 'great', 'know', 'how', 'scary', 'moving', 'can', 'be', 'kids', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'new', 'adventure', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'focus', 'Angelina', 'little', 'sister', 'new', 'dance', 'teacher', 'school', 'are', 'full', 'dancing', 'singing']",N/A

Between the British accent (which should sound lovely) and all the whining she does, I can't stand this DVD.  Thankfully it's not one of my daughter's favorites either.
