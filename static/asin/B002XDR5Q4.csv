1297574,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B002XDR5Q4,calvinnme,"[13, 13]","""Never Too Late"" is a cute little film about a 50 year old woman (Maureen O'Sullivan) and her 60 year old husband (Paul Ford) who find out they are going to be parents a second time. Their first and only child is a 25 year old married daughter who, along with her 27-year old husband, lives with her parents in their large home. Her husband works for her father in his lumber supply business. This was produced by the team of Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin, and you can't help but feel they were warming up for ""All in the Family"" with this one, there are so many similarities. The middle-aged wife is named Edith, and prior to the pregnancy being discovered, she is running around the home at a manic pace doing housework. The son-in-law is constantly being kicked around and disrespected by his father-in-law, and the daughter is constantly bursting into tears. All that's missing is the social commentary of All in the Family.There is a trailer on this one, and it's funny to see how even as early as the 60's advertising for films would try to mislead to draw in younger audiences. The trailer puts the emphasis on the young couple and only mentions the middle-aged pregnancy at the end, when in fact the emphasis of the film is on the older couple.This film looks and sounds very good, and is presented in its original widescreen aspect ratio. The manufacturing defect is pixelation toward the middle of the film that is not too distracting - but it is definitely there. Careful inspection of the disc revealed ""the blue ring of annoying pixelation"" rather than the more serious ""purple ring of death"" found on the Hot Millions Warner Archive DVD-R, and Warner Brothers will exchange it if you call them, but the point is I shouldn't have to call them. Any company charging this much for a film with absolutely no frills should at least get the quality right - the first time. Looking at various chat logs on this subject, I see that several people have had the same problem I have with this particular product, so beware.  That's why I'm knocking my rating down from 5 to 4 stars.",4,Another great film plagued by manufacturing defects,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,2082,"['Never', 'Too', 'Late', 'cute', 'little', 'film', '50', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'Maureen', ""O'Sullivan"", '60', 'year', 'old', 'husband', 'Paul', 'Ford', 'who', 'find', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'parents', 'second', 'time', 'first', 'only', 'child', '25', 'year', 'old', 'married', 'daughter', 'who', '27-year', 'old', 'husband', 'parents', 'large', 'home', 'husband', 'works', 'father', 'lumber', 'supply', 'business', 'was', 'produced', 'team', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'Bud', 'Yorkin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'were', 'warming', 'up', 'Family', 'one', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'similarities', 'middle-aged', 'wife', 'named', 'Edith', 'prior', 'pregnancy', 'being', 'discovered', 'running', 'home', 'manic', 'pace', 'doing', 'housework', 'son-in-law', 'constantly', 'being', 'kicked', 'disrespected', 'father-in-law', 'daughter', 'constantly', 'bursting', 'tears', 'missing', 'social', 'commentary', 'All', 'Family.There', 'trailer', 'one', 'funny', 'see', 'how', 'even', 'as', 'early', '60', 'advertising', 'films', 'would', 'try', 'mislead', 'draw', 'younger', 'audiences', 'trailer', 'emphasis', 'young', 'couple', 'only', 'mentions', 'middle-aged', 'pregnancy', 'end', 'when', 'fact', 'emphasis', 'film', 'older', 'couple.This', 'film', 'looks', 'very', 'good', 'presented', 'original', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'manufacturing', 'defect', 'pixelation', 'middle', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'distracting', 'definitely', 'there', 'Careful', 'inspection', 'disc', 'revealed', 'blue', 'ring', 'annoying', 'pixelation', 'rather', 'more', 'serious', 'purple', 'ring', 'death', 'found', 'Hot', 'Millions', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'DVD-R', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'will', 'exchange', 'call', 'point', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'call', 'company', 'charging', 'much', 'film', 'absolutely', 'frills', 'should', 'least', 'get', 'quality', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'Looking', 'various', 'chat', 'logs', 'subject', 'see', 'several', 'people', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'have', 'particular', 'product', 'so', 'beware', 'why', ""'m"", 'knocking', 'rating', 'down', '5', '4', 'stars']",N/A

1297584,A397EBXFF0QFN5,B002XDR5Q4,Techman,"[3, 3]","I don't rate films for their content or story, since those ""opinions"" can be found all over the net and obviously and since If purchased it, it's because I like the film. My review or rating is for its video quality and/or technical deficiency when warranted.In the case of ""Never Too Late"", it's part of Warner Bros. ""Archive Collection"". That means for the most part it's a DVD-R that has been ""burned to order"", as opposed to a mass produced DVD, which is pressed like a record. Although I've NEVER had a problem playing this type of disk, some older set top DVD players might have problems playing it.For a film that hasn't been restored, ""Never Too Late"" has very good picture quality and color (It doesn't have that reddish look that looks deficient of blues and was a Technicolor IB dye film) and was made as an ""anamorphic widescreen"" disc.  If you're not familiar with this type of disc, suffice to say that it will produce a BETTER picture than just a plain ""letterboxed widescreen"" DVD.Normally, because I use a video projector in my screening room, I no longer buy regular DVD's since the quality is poor when blown up on a large screen.  I've been replacing many DVD's with Blu-rays as they've become available. Since most Blu-rays look as good, if not better than the 16mm films I used to collect, I don't mind replacing these films with Blu-rays. However, with these Warner Archive films, it's unlikely that they will be available on Blu-ray in the near future, if ever.  It's really too bad, since a number of the films in the Warner Archive Collection were originally released as pressed DVD, but are now only available as these ""ON DEMAND BURNED DISCS"".  One particular film that comes to mind is ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"". I can only wonder what the incompetents at Warner's were thinking?  That film should have been restored if necessary, and released on Blu-ray. Maybe they plan to do that some day, but by that time, anyone who remembers the film will probably be dead.",4,"It's ""Never Too Late""....to get a great comedy.",1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,1995,"['do', ""n't"", 'rate', 'films', 'content', 'story', 'opinions', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'net', 'obviously', 'purchased', 'like', 'film', 'review', 'rating', 'video', 'quality', 'and/or', 'technical', 'deficiency', 'when', 'case', 'Never', 'Too', 'Late', 'part', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'most', 'part', 'DVD-R', 'been', 'burned', 'order', 'opposed', 'mass', 'produced', 'DVD', 'pressed', 'record', ""'ve"", 'NEVER', 'had', 'problem', 'playing', 'type', 'disk', 'older', 'set', 'top', 'DVD', 'players', 'might', 'have', 'problems', 'playing', 'it.For', 'film', ""n't"", 'been', 'restored', 'Never', 'Too', 'Late', 'very', 'good', 'picture', 'quality', 'color', ""n't"", 'have', 'reddish', 'look', 'deficient', 'blues', 'was', 'Technicolor', 'IB', 'dye', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'disc', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'type', 'disc', 'suffice', 'say', 'will', 'produce', 'BETTER', 'picture', 'just', 'plain', 'letterboxed', 'widescreen', 'DVD.Normally', 'use', 'video', 'projector', 'screening', 'room', 'no', 'longer', 'buy', 'regular', 'DVD', 'quality', 'poor', 'when', 'blown', 'up', 'large', 'screen', ""'ve"", 'been', 'replacing', 'many', 'DVD', 'Blu-rays', ""'ve"", 'become', 'available', 'most', 'Blu-rays', 'look', 'good', 'not', 'better', '16mm', 'films', 'used', 'collect', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'replacing', 'films', 'Blu-rays', 'However', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'films', 'unlikely', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'Blu-ray', 'near', 'future', 'ever', 'really', 'too', 'bad', 'number', 'films', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'were', 'originally', 'released', 'pressed', 'DVD', 'are', 'now', 'only', 'available', 'ON', 'DEMAND', 'BURNED', 'DISCS', 'One', 'particular', 'film', 'mind', 'Unsinkable', 'Molly', 'Brown', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'incompetents', 'Warner', 'were', 'thinking', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'restored', 'necessary', 'released', 'Blu-ray', 'Maybe', 'plan', 'do', 'day', 'time', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'dead']",N/A
