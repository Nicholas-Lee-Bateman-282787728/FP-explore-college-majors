645442,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00005JP3W,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[1, 4]","I had heard a great deal of positive response on this film, but hadn't got around to watching it until recently. I expected it to be good, but I never expected anything this good. The writing is razor-sharp and the film is completely unpredictable which made it so fiendishly good and enormously entertaining.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A fourteen-year-old girl named Haley meets a thirty-two-year-old guy named Jeff over the internet and they decide to meet at a restaurant and then decide to go back to his place. He shows her around his home and decides to give her some drinks as well. But Haley turns the tables on Jeff and she drugs him and holds him captive in his own home where she constantly interrogates him and asks him the whereabouts a missing woman whose picture he just so happens to have and what he did the teenage girls he took pictures of. No matter what Jeff does, she always outsmarts him and mocks him in the process.MUSIC: The music for the most part is actually pretty good, and it fit the mood of this psychotic and brilliant horror/thriller very well.ACTING: I really got to hand it to Ellen Page's performance (She was the actress who played Juno), she easily gives the best performance. She was smart, witty with dark humor, and she played the role a psychopath flawlessly. Patrick Wilson (He played Nite Owl in Watchmen) also puts on a great show as a demented pedaphile who is terrified of this girl. For the most part, I can see no flaws in their performances.ACTION: This film is mostly dialogue only. There is very little in terms of violence and almost no blood. I really have to hand it to the writer of this film because the dialogue is sharp and clever and this film was almost never boring (Though there were a few moments in which it was a tad boring). The characters always had something to talk about and keep you on edge the entire time. This film feels very fresh and is completely unpredictable and waiting for what's around the next corner is always exciting.OVERALL: Tired of the usual cliched horror films or thrillers? Hard Candy is the perfect choice for you. This film is a superbly crafted piece that always leaves you on edge and always makes you guess what comes next. You can't say that about other films in this day and age.THE GOOD: Sharply written story and dialogue, good music, and flawless acting.THE BAD: Some moments were a tad boring.",5,A BRILLIANT AND VERY CLEVER HORROR/THRILLER  9.5 OUT OF 10,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,2387,"['had', 'heard', 'great', 'deal', 'positive', 'response', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'got', 'around', 'watching', 'recently', 'expected', 'be', 'good', 'never', 'expected', 'anything', 'good', 'writing', 'razor-sharp', 'film', 'completely', 'unpredictable', 'made', 'so', 'fiendishly', 'good', 'enormously', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'fourteen-year-old', 'girl', 'named', 'Haley', 'thirty-two-year-old', 'guy', 'named', 'Jeff', 'internet', 'decide', 'meet', 'restaurant', 'then', 'decide', 'go', 'back', 'place', 'home', 'decides', 'give', 'drinks', 'well', 'Haley', 'tables', 'Jeff', 'drugs', 'captive', 'own', 'home', 'where', 'constantly', 'whereabouts', 'missing', 'woman', 'picture', 'just', 'so', 'have', 'what', 'did', 'teenage', 'girls', 'took', 'pictures', 'matter', 'what', 'Jeff', 'always', 'mocks', 'process.MUSIC', 'music', 'most', 'part', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'fit', 'mood', 'psychotic', 'brilliant', 'horror/thriller', 'very', 'well.ACTING', 'really', 'got', 'hand', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'performance', 'was', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Juno', 'easily', 'best', 'performance', 'was', 'smart', 'witty', 'dark', 'humor', 'played', 'role', 'psychopath', 'flawlessly', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'played', 'Nite', 'Owl', 'Watchmen', 'also', 'great', 'show', 'demented', 'pedaphile', 'who', 'terrified', 'girl', 'most', 'part', 'can', 'see', 'flaws', 'performances.ACTION', 'film', 'mostly', 'dialogue', 'only', 'very', 'little', 'terms', 'violence', 'almost', 'blood', 'really', 'have', 'hand', 'writer', 'film', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'clever', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'never', 'boring', 'were', 'few', 'moments', 'was', 'tad', 'boring', 'characters', 'always', 'had', 'something', 'talk', 'keep', 'edge', 'entire', 'time', 'film', 'very', 'fresh', 'completely', 'unpredictable', 'waiting', 'what', 'next', 'corner', 'always', 'exciting.OVERALL', 'Tired', 'usual', 'cliched', 'horror', 'films', 'thrillers', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'perfect', 'choice', 'film', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'piece', 'always', 'edge', 'always', 'guess', 'what', 'next', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'other', 'films', 'day', 'age.THE', 'GOOD', 'Sharply', 'written', 'story', 'dialogue', 'good', 'music', 'flawless', 'acting.THE', 'BAD', 'moments', 'were', 'tad', 'boring']",N/A

645444,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B00005JP3W,A Customer,"[25, 31]","In one of the most beautifully acted films of the year, director David Slade's provocative Hard Candy asks a number of provocative questions: When does the predator become the victim? To what extent is vigilantism justified? And what justifies one person going after such cold-blooded revenge? The film starts out with two anonymous people chatting on the Internet. The repartee is seductive and tantalizing.Fourteen-year-old doll-like Hayley (Ellen Page) offers to meet the older man Jeff (Patrick Wilson) at a coffee shop, where he wipes chocolate from her lip with his finger and continues the predator's dance. Jeff isn't your stereotypical pedophile; he's young, handsome and sexy, and an upwardly mobile fashion photographer. Jeff buys Hayley a coffee and a shirt and they talk about literature and film whilst she tries the shirt on.Hayley proves that she's perky and sweet and way bright beyond her years and soon they are heading back to Jeff's secluded, modernist house deep in the Hollywood Hills. He makes her a vodka and orange and offers up an impromptu photo shoot. Pretty soon we realize that there's something not quite right about this scenario.It turns out that little Hayley isn't as innocent as we thought she was. Without giving too much the plot away, Hayley launches into an unrelenting and sometimes stomach-turning inquest into the older man's secret life as a pervert and a possible murderer. Jeff adamantly denies killing a girl who has recently gone missing, but the innocent Hayley will not be swayed.What makes this film so spectacular is that when the tables are turned, we as the viewer are forced to rethink our sympathies for the predator and the prey and as the boundaries between the good and the bad guy become blurred, we are left with just these two damaged characters in a claustrophobic house where their dangerous cat and mouse dance is gradually played out.Although there is a small - and welcome - appearance from the lovely Sandra Ho as a concerned neighbor, much of the movie is just Page and Wilson, each fighting for the upper hand, which gives the film the look of a tense one-act play. Obviously the actors have to be strong in this type of film and really know their characters, luckily both Page and Wilson indeed rise the occasion.The boyish Page is remarkably confident, as the pixie-faced, scalpel-wielding vigilante and she's really able to imbue the right balance of anger and sympathy. Though Jeff is clearly a sneak and a sleaze from the beginning - he makes no apologies for the fact that he likes little girls and is meeting them on the Web - to his credit Wilson adeptly shades Jeff - giving him a sympathetic and shameful back-story. It's open to question how sleazy he actually is.Hard Candy is Slick and stylish in its writing, direction and design, and as the psychological thriller it works beautifully, mostly on the strength of powerful performances by Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson. Although many have called this film exploitative, because of its provocative subject - pedophilia, the film is powerful and subversive and raises some serious issues about the psyche of men such as this. This is confrontational filmmaking at its best with a dark, daring and bold heart.

I had no idea what it was about but saw the little girl in a red hooded sweatshirt and decided to see it (very educated guess, I know). It turned out that this is a great film, with superb acting. The acting, more so than the incredible story is the strength of this movie. Ellen Page (Mouth to Mouth, I Downloaded a Ghost) plays the protagonist marvelously. Patrick Wilson (Running with Scissors, Angels in America)'s anguish and creepiness are in tune with where they need to be throughout the entire movie. Any further review will be a spoiler for the plot and this movie deserves to be seen without preamble.

Jenista,"[3, 4]","Solid acting by Ellen Page, who carries this off without a hitch - although in some ways you wonder how a teenage girl could be sophisticated like this. Entertaining, and a bit of a nail biter.SPOLER ALERT --- Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie, or care to be surprisedThere's some fundamental part of the movie I really dislike, and it's the only reason I've bothered to post on this film (there are much better films I have seen recently, none as deserving of a social commentary however).The child molester becomes the victim of a psychopathic killer child, and that's just wrong. At any point in the movie, he could've killed her in self-defense, and you would've sighed a breath of relief. Of course you don't know the big secret at the end (well, in fact, you're guessing it earlier when he does escape and doesn't call the police, which he should of). And the child loses all innocence when she tortures him, and then plans to stage his suicide. Which she finally gets by his consent, through coercion - getting him to hang himself so that she won't reveal his kiddie porn collection to his childhood sweetheart. And this again crosses the line - the evidence it turns out includes a photo linking him to a child-rape-murder victim, and as such should've been given to the police, with the other information she had, that would've meant a conviction, and under the circumstances execution. Legal execution, with the victim's family not having justice snatched from them. A trial exposing him; societal catharsis.There is no satisfaction in finding the murderer of your daughter killed himself. I really dislike the vigilante nature of the film, and how it goes even further in suggesting that teenage girls like this are sophisticated enough to commit this type of crime. If they're really that sophisticated (and they are not) then he is less of a villain for attempting her seduction. This 14 year old girl he picks up on the internet has in fact been stalking him? She has inside information that he was involved in a snuff photo-shoot? If it were true, her premeditated ability and uncanny intelligence combined with her monstrous acts would make her a candidate for the death penalty herself. It does a great disservice to potential victims of these crimes in that it paints a picture of a grown intelligent person, instead of the mere child they are.In the final analysis Haley is a monster of equal proportion to him, and perhaps more so for subverting justice. A great film, with an ugly and incorrect message. The monster was, and should have firmly remained, the molester, not his intended victim. In the end we are left with two monsters, one of which  reinforces the twisted viewpoint that minors are mature enough for sexual involvement, which they certainly are not.",3,Scary movie with a questionable message (SPOILERS),1216252800,"07 17, 2008",2008,2798,"['Solid', 'acting', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'who', 'off', 'hitch', 'ways', 'wonder', 'how', 'teenage', 'girl', 'could', 'be', 'sophisticated', 'Entertaining', 'bit', 'nail', 'biter.SPOLER', 'ALERT', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'care', 'be', 'fundamental', 'part', 'movie', 'really', 'dislike', 'only', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'bothered', 'post', 'film', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'recently', 'none', 'deserving', 'social', 'commentary', 'however', '.The', 'child', 'molester', 'victim', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'child', 'just', 'wrong', 'point', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'killed', 'self-defense', 'would', ""'ve"", 'sighed', 'breath', 'relief', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'big', 'secret', 'end', 'well', 'fact', ""'re"", 'guessing', 'earlier', 'when', 'escape', ""n't"", 'call', 'police', 'should', 'child', 'innocence', 'when', 'then', 'stage', 'suicide', 'Which', 'finally', 'consent', 'coercion', 'getting', 'hang', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'kiddie', 'porn', 'collection', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'again', 'line', 'evidence', 'out', 'photo', 'linking', 'child-rape-murder', 'victim', 'such', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'police', 'other', 'information', 'had', 'would', ""'ve"", 'meant', 'conviction', 'circumstances', 'execution', 'Legal', 'execution', 'victim', 'family', 'not', 'having', 'justice', 'snatched', 'trial', 'exposing', 'societal', 'satisfaction', 'finding', 'murderer', 'daughter', 'killed', 'really', 'dislike', 'vigilante', 'nature', 'film', 'how', 'even', 'further', 'suggesting', 'teenage', 'girls', 'are', 'sophisticated', 'enough', 'commit', 'type', 'crime', ""'re"", 'really', 'sophisticated', 'are', 'not', 'then', 'less', 'villain', 'attempting', 'seduction', '14', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'up', 'internet', 'fact', 'been', 'stalking', 'inside', 'information', 'was', 'involved', 'snuff', 'photo-shoot', 'were', 'true', 'premeditated', 'ability', 'uncanny', 'intelligence', 'combined', 'monstrous', 'acts', 'would', 'make', 'candidate', 'death', 'penalty', 'great', 'disservice', 'potential', 'victims', 'crimes', 'picture', 'grown', 'intelligent', 'person', 'instead', 'mere', 'child', 'are.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'Haley', 'monster', 'equal', 'proportion', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'subverting', 'justice', 'great', 'film', 'ugly', 'incorrect', 'message', 'monster', 'was', 'should', 'have', 'firmly', 'remained', 'molester', 'not', 'intended', 'victim', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'two', 'monsters', 'one', 'twisted', 'viewpoint', 'minors', 'are', 'mature', 'enough', 'sexual', 'involvement', 'certainly', 'are', 'not']",N/A

The story revolves around Hayley, An intelligent pretty 14 yr old girl who likes to spend most of her time online. One day while surfing the internet, She ends up chatting with Jeff- a man who happens to be 17 years older than she is. After a couple of weeks of chat sessions & flirting they end up deciding to meet at a local coffee shop.While at the coffee shop they start having discussions. They seem to have an instant bond and relate well with eachother but under the surface there is a subtle uneasiness about it all. We can't really tell what Jeff's motives are and It feels like you're being tricked along with Hayley. Tricked because on first impression this guy seems to have only good intentions. He's handsome, well educated, responsible and seems to have her best interest at heart yet below the surface we think we know what he wants at the same time.After talking awhile, Jeff ends up inviting Hayley to his home with the promise of giving her an MP3 of a concert she's been wanting to see. She ends up going with him but what Jeff dosen't know is Hayley already knows what he wants, has a plan and by the time they get to his house this movie does a 180 on the viewer. After that it turns into a nonstop battle of terror.... A fight till the end between victim and captor ensues filled with interesting twists and suprises.You won't think of the internet the same way again...Also you'll question if some people on the internet arent what they appear to be and what motives they may have.

645453,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JP3W,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","`Hard Candy' is seriously one of the best films of 2006.  If you have not seen this little wonder I highly recommend you do immediately.  Director David Slade has done an extraordinary job in delivering a mesmerizing two person act that plays out so smoothly despite it sporadic and at times harsh direction.  That's the real beauty of `Hard Candy', its delivery, which imbeds itself inside your skull and stays with you throughout its full running time, and then still.  The film rarely sees a face other than those of the two leads, but those leads are more than up to the challenge.  Both Patrick Wilson and the young Ellen Page (who's receiving quote the attention for her upcoming comedy `Juno') are phenomenally cast in this dramatic thriller, but I'd be hard pressed to admit the real star is not David Slade.  I was so enthralled with his direction of this film and the risks he was not afraid to take.  In the end this film would have been nothing without him.The storyline follows a young 14-year old girl named Hayley who meets a 32-year old photographer named Jeff on the internet.  The film strategically opens with their chat screen so we can see their interaction before introducing us to them at a local coffee shop.  Hayley is the immediate flirt, as is Jeff, and they soon take their meeting back to his place.  Jeff thinks that everything is going according to plan until Hayley reveals she's not the sweet young thing he thought she was.  She has a secret agenda, a score to settle, a dark secret to unveil and she knows exactly how to do that.The film is a brilliant look at the drive of pure vengeance.  Hayley's character is driven by this inner power, this overwhelming need to exact revenge on a criminal who has apparently gotten away with it all.  She's one smart young girl and this catches her victim off guard.  The fact that I refer to Jeff as a victim is another reason why this film is so amazing.  It allows you to rationalize with a pedophile.  I'm not saying that that is something anyone in their right mind would want to do, but this film allows you to judge for yourself whether or not the punishment fits the crime.  I know that this is not the perfect analogy, and I'm sure people are going to complain about this, but it reminds me a little bit of `A Clockwork Orange', at least the feeling I got the first time I read it.  When you finish the novel you sit back and wonder if the means of justice were just as criminal as the reasons for it.  The same is here.  When Hayley is done the audience is able to sit back and wonder whether or not her means of action were just as horrific as Jeff's initial crime.This film would not have been nearly as effective if it were not for the brilliant performances by the two leads.  Patrick Wilson had such an amazing year, and while `Little Children' was his more popular film, his performance here is milestones ahead of it.  As Jeff he is so incredibly creepy in his charm but he is also pitifully heartbreaking in the eventual breakdown.  He's upstaged though by Ellen Page who gives my favorite performance of the year.  As Hayley she is so in tune with her character's motives and objective that she disappears within her character.  Beings that she was barely eighteen when she shot this film further goes to impress upon us her brilliance.  I really can't say enough good things about her performance, it's that flawless.With a top notch script and excellent acting and direction the film elevates itself into one of the best of the year.  The script for `Hard Candy' was actually conceived after producer David Higgins read reports of Japanese schoolgirls who were ambushing older men who were surfing the web for underage dates.  So this type of thing has happened before.  I highly recommend this film to anyone wanting to watch something separate from the normal media fare.  This is intriguing and entertaining and compelling.

You see it starts off rather bland and predictable for the first 20 minutes as a young girl (played by the wonderfully underrated Ellen Page) meets up with a guy she's been communicating with online, then...The plot *completely* changes and becomes much much better.She's convinced the guy has been touching children inappropriately and even taking pictures of them and hiding the pictures somewhere around the house.  Ellen Page's character then goes totally ballistic. Okay I kind of made an unintentional joke using the word ""ballistic"". I swear I didn't realize that until after I said it.I really don't want to spoil the storyline unlike a few other reviewers below who made no effort whatsoever to hide what eventually happens, so be VERY CAREFUL reading the reviews below mine.Let's just say, the man who plays the 32-year old perverted photographer is absolutely stupid and constantly falls victim to Page's antics.  There's definitely a handful of unrealistic moments, but who cares.The acting is phenomenal, and Ellen Page truly proves exactly WHY she's so deserving of lead role whether she's performing in comedies (Juno) or suspenseful, shocking films like this one.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 7]","Occasionally a piece of cinema pushes boundaries and hits its audience with issues pertaining to choice, judgement, and morality. These are the type of films that divide audiences and add heated comments to after dinner discussions. One such film in recent memory was THE WOODSMAN, starring Kevin Bacon, a story about a pedophile trying to integrate himself back into normal society after being released from prison. It pushed us beyond our normal comfort level and forced us to view the world in a somewhat more empathetic manner regarding these people (a pretty uncomfortable thing to even think about). And HARD CANDY asks the viewer similar disturbing questions but ping-pongs us back and forth between doubt and certainty about what's happening between the two main characters..The story opens with two people in a chat room on the internet, typing suggestive comments to each other. A face-to-face meeting is arranged and when the two come together, it is obvious there are issues here: one is a fourteen-year-old girl named Haley and the other is a 32-year-old photographer named Jeff. From the get-go we're uncomfortable with this meeting, as we know that men in Jeff's age-range shouldn't be meddling with a kid. The ante is upped even higher as Haley agrees to go home with Jeff (indeed, she pushes to go home with him). But once at Jeff's place, the tables rapidly turn. Haley is a smart and possibly psychotic young girl. As we delve deeper and deeper into the film, we begin to feel that maybe Jeff was setup somehow. And as Haley begins to knock Jeff down time and again, the audiences allegiances towards her stance are questioned. Should we be cheering for her? Or worried that Jeff may not be a pedophile after all and simply a nice guy?Time and again the tables get turned, and the viewer is constantly wondering which of these two they should be hoping comes out on top.This is one of the most intense films I've seen in a long time. Not since PSYCHO has this amount of a mental impact been felt. The beginning is somewhat slow to get going and many may feel like this is going to be a cliche-riddled movie. It isn't. As I sat on the couch, watching in horror as the stakes went higher and higher, my fianc&eacute; said, ""Honey? You're squeezing my hand too hard."" I hadn't realized how affected by the movie I'd become until she mentioned this. In fact, several times I held my breath, something that is a cliche in itself, but something I couldn't help.The acting and script for Hard Candy are absolutely superlative. Young Ellen Page (who was eighteen at the time but fits well into the role of a fourteen-year-old) delivers the performance of a lifetime. Her intensity, especially during a set of scenes I like to call ""The Home Surgery Mutilation"" is so creepy, frightening, and sick, that I actually felt nauseous. Patrick Wilson as Jeff is just as impressive and I felt equally repulsed and worried for him as the minutes ticked by.The movie isn't forcefully bloody or grotesque, either. Its success is owed solely to the interactions of the characters and not, necessarily, what they do to each other. Men, be forewarned, you may have nightmares when you're done watching it.When the flick was over, I felt spent, as if I'd just ran a set of mental hurdles.

645468,AM2VJQCJWBBSG,B00005JP3W,"BrooklynBEM ""BrooklynBEM""","[4, 6]","We've all seen the cover-art for the film Hard Candy: A young girl with a red hooded sweatshirt stands in the center of an enormous bear trap. The poster is great, never revealing the intricacies of the plot (what is the bear trap going to catch exactly?). It's a calculated and smart move on the side of the filmmakers, because when the plot of your movie focuses on a 32 year old possible pedophile courting a 14 year old psychopath, you've got your work cut out for you. From Extremities to Death and the Maiden, films focusing on psychological mind games of two main characters are a hard sell at the box office. Really, who wants to see Farrah Fawcett or Ben Kingsley being interrogated and terrorized for 90 minutes? (Don't answer that.) The best chance any film of this (what I'll call) ""highbrow torture"" genre has in being successful by any standard lies in the intelligence of the filmmakers. One false move could turn a film like this into a Hostel mess.When the film begins, Haley (the 14 year old) and Jeff (the 32 year old) are having a lot of fun with each other over the Internet, chatting and flirting away. Both are aware of the age difference between them, however under the guise of a possible photo shoot (Jeff's a photographer), the flirting is kept in the context of this opportunity. The audience then enters the cafe with Jeff as he finally meets Haley in person for the first time - and things get crazy from there.Hard Candy, despite of its icky subject matter, has a lot going for it. As with Extremities and Maiden, the films feels like a play, and it plays like a good one. The film is chatty in all the right places, as the audience gets to know its damaged central characters. Sympathies swap back and forth between the two leads, as secrets are shared and confessions are made. (The irony here is that in another movie, Haley and Jeff could probably end up being legitimate - albeit dysfunctional - friends, yet its painfully clear it won't be the case here.)Since Hard Candy is a two-character driven story, a lot rests on the shoulders of the lead actors. Ellen Page (X-Men: The Last Stand) is fairly chilling in her portrayal of Haley. An early scene in which Haley reveals that she may have more than one Internet screen name - and what that means to Jeff - is one of the most terrifying moments in the film, and Page delivers this detail with the ice cold precision of a great dramatic actress. Page is more effective in these scenes (the quieter, tenser moments) than during her occasional whack-job monologues, sounding a bit too rehearsed for even a brainy 14 year old. Patrick Wilson (Little Children) is excellent throughout in a risky and physically exhausting performance. It's not often in film where a grown man literally cries for help (especially a man who may or may not have done some despicable things in his past), but Wilson delivers all the pain, humiliation and rationality with an energized and ultra-realistic performance that keeps the challenging material watchable. Regardless of what he may or may not have done, we do feel sorry for him, in the pathetic sense of the word.Director David Slade conducts the controversial affairs with a hyper-conscious pace and keen eye. Slade moves most of the proceedings along at a breakneck speed, perhaps to not give us time to really grasp that they're watching two ultimately unsavory personalities. Through the use of extreme close-ups (both of these characters mean business), a crisp clean set (Jeff's house, with its red walls and stainless steel kitchen table, is as aesthetically pleasing as it is chilling), and a crafty script, the film keeps us wondering who exactly we should be rooting for. It's not easy to find the hero of Hard Candy, assuming there is one, and that decidedly cold tone was a smart and satisfying choice.The directing is not perfect though. The first few scenes of violent physicality are cut in a jumpy, jolting way that seem better suited for a Jet Li movie. There's also the question of how easily Jeff recuperates from a rather delicate surgical procedure.By keeping the activity cerebral-based with each character trying to outwit the other, instead of violence-based (for a ""torture"" film, there's little to no blood), the viewer can focus on the issues at hand: Who's right? Who's wrong?

645469,AN8K6OR4NKI0V,B00005JP3W,Bruno,"[7, 14]","Hard Candy appeared at just the right time a couple of years back.  Cinema audiences in America have been in decline for a number of years, particularly amongst the web 2.0 generation, a decline attributed largely to the emergence of the 'teenage bitch fight' phenomenon that has exploded onto the internet.  It seems that the average twenty something American male has forsaken the cinematic experience and now prefers watching 5 minute clips of young high school girls bullying and beating each other half to death in front of a baying mob of adolescents. This pride of the American education system spur the combatants on with stirring battle cries such as 'F*** her up Ashley' or 'go for the eyes, go for the eyes'.  These videos proliferate on youtube and in fact there are hundreds of websites devoted to the 'bitch fight' with names such as 'Almost Killed' that now attract millions of visitors.Whilst these videos can appear traumatic to over sensitive older people who still don't like to see 13 year old girls being bullied and having their hair pulled out, their faces stomped on etc, the 'bitch fight' community does have a sound ethical side.  Viewers of the videos are often invited to leave comments, and whilst most are of the healthy variety : 'not enough blood',  'why did that old fart break it up before it got interesting, probably a perv' etc some are quite disturbing and inappropriate such as 'she was quite pretty, shame someone didn't stop it before she had her eye scratched out'.  Such people are rightly jumped on by the others in the community as the sick paedos that they probably are.This is the context of Hard Candy.  A movie that exploits just about everything that makes American culture so great today : violence, jailbait, feminism, disturbed adolescence, a perverted sexuality, and above all a hypocritical, fake, shallow morality.  Young guys can watch this film and lust at the young Ellen Page and yet still leave the cinema feeling that they themselves have been real men and cut off a paedophile's penis (their own?) whilst their girlfriends can watch it as a girlpower feminist statement and be comfortable in the knowledge that their boyfriend knows what will happen if he ever dumps her for a younger female who looks like Ellen.Is it art?  Their are certainly clever references to Roman Polanski, but it seems to forget, that amongst intelligent people, at least in Europe, Polanski is a man revered for escaping not only Nazi Germany, but America and Hollywood too.",1,"Violent, nauseating and exploitative...but still doesn't quite work",1217116800,"07 27, 2008",2008,2514,"['Hard', 'Candy', 'appeared', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'Cinema', 'audiences', 'America', 'have', 'been', 'decline', 'number', 'years', 'particularly', 'web', '2.0', 'generation', 'decline', 'attributed', 'largely', 'emergence', ""'teenage"", 'bitch', 'fight', 'phenomenon', 'exploded', 'internet', 'average', 'twenty', 'something', 'American', 'male', 'forsaken', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'now', 'prefers', 'watching', '5', 'minute', 'clips', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'girls', 'bullying', 'beating', 'other', 'half', 'death', 'front', 'baying', 'mob', 'adolescents', 'pride', 'American', 'education', 'system', 'spur', 'combatants', 'stirring', 'battle', 'cries', 'such', 'F***', 'up', 'Ashley', ""'go"", 'eyes', 'go', 'eyes', 'videos', 'proliferate', 'youtube', 'fact', 'are', 'hundreds', 'websites', 'devoted', ""'bitch"", 'fight', 'names', 'such', 'Killed', 'now', 'attract', 'millions', 'visitors.Whilst', 'videos', 'can', 'appear', 'traumatic', 'sensitive', 'older', 'people', 'who', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', '13', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'being', 'bullied', 'having', 'hair', 'pulled', 'out', 'stomped', 'etc', ""'bitch"", 'fight', 'community', 'have', 'sound', 'ethical', 'side', 'Viewers', 'videos', 'are', 'often', 'invited', 'leave', 'comments', 'most', 'are', 'healthy', 'variety', 'enough', 'blood', 'did', 'old', 'fart', 'break', 'up', 'got', 'interesting', 'probably', 'perv', 'etc', 'are', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'inappropriate', 'such', ""'she"", 'was', 'quite', 'pretty', 'shame', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'had', 'eye', 'scratched', 'out', 'Such', 'people', 'are', 'rightly', 'jumped', 'others', 'community', 'sick', 'paedos', 'probably', 'are.This', 'context', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'A', 'movie', 'just', 'everything', 'American', 'culture', 'so', 'great', 'today', 'violence', 'jailbait', 'feminism', 'disturbed', 'adolescence', 'perverted', 'sexuality', 'hypocritical', 'fake', 'shallow', 'morality', 'Young', 'guys', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'lust', 'young', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'yet', 'still', 'leave', 'cinema', 'feeling', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'men', 'cut', 'off', 'paedophile', 'penis', 'own', 'whilst', 'girlfriends', 'can', 'watch', 'girlpower', 'feminist', 'statement', 'be', 'comfortable', 'knowledge', 'boyfriend', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'ever', 'younger', 'female', 'who', 'Ellen.Is', 'art', 'are', 'certainly', 'clever', 'references', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'forget', 'amongst', 'intelligent', 'people', 'least', 'Europe', 'Polanski', 'man', 'revered', 'escaping', 'not', 'only', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'America', 'Hollywood', 'too']",N/A
645470,A21VGNU5959O85,B00005JP3W,CaterpillarGirl,"[0, 3]","Hard candy is one of those movies, where you have some *idea* about what it's about, and once you start watching it you quickly realize that you had *no* idea what so ever. You can turn on the TV any given day and see some news station, talk show host or investigative report on child predators. Lately we have all been subjected to the Amber Alerts, Megan's Law, the pictures of the innocent children who we all know are dead, and the new phenomenon on dateline NBC where people pose as children to lure predators to houses than they ambush them, confront them than arrest them. I am sure that the public outcry if not deftly handled by law enforcement would result in many a pedophile being strung up. These men and women, too many people, get off too easily. They have to register as sex offenders, have their pictures on websites and wear ankle bracelets, not a fitting punishment for someone who hurts children for a living.This movie takes that concept of ""payback"" to a whole new level, and asks *what if the child took the upper hand* What If a 14 year old girl, researches and finds predators, hunts them down and makes them pay? What on earth could she do? The answer is *a lot* Hailey is a smart, precocious, crafty little bundle of vengeance, and it wasn't too far fetched to see her doing what she did. I know a lot of reviewers say it was unrealistic, that no 14 year old is that smart or strong, I would like to point out that maybe their children are just not that way, but there are those out there who are living beyond normal potential. Adrenaline, smart planning, and common sense outweigh age any day.It is a raw and brutal movie, not for the squeamish or faint at heart. At times you are asking yourself if you feel sorry for this man, or if Hailey is the monster, I have to admit in the end I wasn't crying for his loss.I love the instances throughout the movie of--choosing between embarrassment and shame or bodily harm.-- underestimating your preyThis isn't a family movie, or a movie to show children what so ever, its not a movie to show the dangers of the computer or stranger danger, it's a movie for adults who have ever enjoyed the ""ole switcharoo"" scenario.

In Act I, you are not going to be sure who to feel sorry for. Hang in there, the story unravels in emotion and action that made my husband 'squirm' (slight giggle there). I pictured guys on the set doing the same during this particular scene. The web of lies is taken apart and we know who is the true victim in the end.

Though in truth the ending.....Anyway we start at a Star bucks coffee shop where we the viewers are introduced to a man in his 30's who is meeting a girl for the first time who is 14???  Anyway they chat for 20min getting to further know each other(they have only chatted on-line you see) and the young girl is very aggressive and would REALLY like to see the man's home.  Once inside we see that our male character is a photographer who takes pictures of only women DA-DA-DUN! He makes himself and his guest a drink where upon she smartly declines  And pours it out.  She however makes a drink for him and while he drinks she suggests he takes pictures of her DA-DA-DUN!  While he takes photographs  he starts to black out and eventually faints. Many hours he wakes up to find himself tied and taped to a chair.  He thinks its a game but THE GAME IS OVER!!!  The 14 yr.old girl is looking to find out what kind of guy she has before her and what kind of sicko gets off on 14 yr olds.  She looks desperately through out the house to find evidence and all the while cutting him and slapping him till he tells her.  a hour goes by as she trashes the house with no luck!  She looks and looks when finally she sees again the table with many little rocks on top.  She moves all the rocks and their is a safe!?!  We discover she does have a pedophile on her hands and also something more.  She begins surgery(her father is a doctor you see)and is going to castrate the male so she can pure him of his lust.  This however turns into a cat and mouse game which for me was kind of a let down.  I'd prefer it to stay with the HORROR aspects and leave the crime/drama out the window.  Still this is a good movie with great performances from its two stars and for those who like a twist at the end...This has it.

If you're this far into the reviews you heard it stated & mis-stated a lot.I believed early on that pedophilia was the subject the show was about. By movies end I had decided the real subject matter here was excess. Over the top - mind bending excess. I no longer think the writer had any intention of showing the molester or the avenging angel in any kind of seriously actual light. The subject of pedophilia has been a hot issue for a long time now & the fact that this guy is a predator makes him the most disgusting kind of molester to most people. This show was created for most people not actual victims. It's a movie made for profit not a social commentary.Once you leave the,"" is this a realistic portrayal of pedophilia behind?"" You quickly catch on to what's happening here. Every scene as it develops will be presented in the most outlandish & bizarre manner. This is a show that was meant to leave you a little stunned at all the preposterous scenes put together into a movie & it does make a movie that's about complete excess. If you're not into that you will hate this show, not to mention get hung up on the wrong theme. The pedophilia is simply a lightning rod for deep emotion. They sure got that much out of this show. Patrick Wilson & Ellen Page deserve credit for putting the show on their shoulders. They knew going in that this would be a divisive show & they would be the targets.I see comments about he was innocent or he was never proven guilty. He, however, felt he was proven guilty & caught red handed. Watch the end of the show. I'm not saying it's a perfectly legal portrayal of a conviction but maybe you noticed he had no jury, just an appeal proof judge. I read ""she is only 14"". I admit she looked 14 & said she was 14. She also lied some.The guy is scum, human debris, they really don't leave room to argue about that point; even murder is admitted to. The question here is, was she any better? Did she become so excessive that her monster is as bad as or worse than his? The terrorization of his mind was intended to at least equalize the fear his victims felt & in this case most likely get some payback, make his suffering worse. You know, like if he is gonna make girls wonder about their immediate & future sex lives, well two can play that game. Our little girl hasn't stayed daddy's daughter. She is a predator all on her own & since her prey would not usually expect her kind of attack, she gets first shot.This movie asks the question; can a human being become so low & defiled that we can treat them like a lion that attacked your family? Your family is mankind here. Should the predator of children be hunted down & killed as if they were a predatory beast?This movie doesn't care about setting a social standard.

It takes the already engrossing subject matter of online predators and puts an interesting twist on it. The first 75-or-so minutes are truly unflinchingly powerful, but the story begins to lose it's edge in the final act and ultimately ends with an oddly unsatisfying climax. Honestly, one of the only things that keeps Hard Candy from being an especially gruesome Lifetime movie is it's incredible actors. On paper, Ellen Page's character would seem ridiculous and over-the-top. However, she completely harnesses her characters manipulative sociopathic behavior and makes it so convincing. Patrick Wilson is a great choice for a deeply-disturbed pedophile because of his good nature and genuine handsome face. At one point, his character says something along the lines of 'peoples faces lie,' and that statement couldn't be more true given Page's even more innocent, prepubescent looks. David Slade's directing has a very amateurish quality to it, especially some scenes that strongly reflect Slade's background in music videos. It's by no means terrible, but the film's style could have fared better in the hands of someone like Takashi Miike. Hard Candy is nothing groundbreaking, and its ending could have definitely been more effective, but Ellen Page's performance is enough reason alone to revisit this little gem.",4,Everyone's A Villain,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,1382,"['Hard', 'Candy', 'alluring', 'piece', 'shoestring-budget', 'cinema', 'already', 'engrossing', 'subject', 'matter', 'online', 'predators', 'interesting', 'twist', 'first', '75-or-so', 'minutes', 'are', 'truly', 'unflinchingly', 'powerful', 'story', 'lose', 'edge', 'final', 'act', 'ultimately', 'oddly', 'unsatisfying', 'climax', 'Honestly', 'one', 'only', 'things', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'being', 'especially', 'gruesome', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'incredible', 'actors', 'paper', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'character', 'would', 'seem', 'ridiculous', 'over-the-top', 'However', 'completely', 'characters', 'manipulative', 'sociopathic', 'behavior', 'so', 'convincing', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'great', 'choice', 'deeply-disturbed', 'pedophile', 'good', 'nature', 'genuine', 'handsome', 'face', 'one', 'point', 'character', 'something', 'lines', ""'peoples"", 'lie', 'statement', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'true', 'given', 'Page', 'even', 'more', 'innocent', 'prepubescent', 'looks', 'David', 'Slade', 'directing', 'very', 'amateurish', 'quality', 'especially', 'scenes', 'strongly', 'reflect', 'Slade', 'background', 'music', 'videos', 'means', 'terrible', 'film', 'style', 'could', 'have', 'fared', 'better', 'hands', 'someone', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'nothing', 'groundbreaking', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'definitely', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'performance', 'enough', 'reason', 'alone', 'revisit', 'little', 'gem']",N/A

This is the performance that the academy should really sink their teeth into but for some reason I highly doubt that'll happen.Haley is fourteen.  Jeff is thirty-two.  For three weeks they have been communicating in online chat rooms and finally they are going to meet for coffee.  When they do meet they realize that neither is what the other expected.  Jeff is a handsome and intelligent photographer, and Haley is extremely mature for her young age, a borderline medical student.  After some persuasion of Haley's part Jeff takes her back to his place for some drinks and maybe an impromptu photo session.Halfway through that photo session thinks turn ugly, and when Jeff wakes up he realizes that not only is Haley is mature...she's also insane.  The remainder of the film is a complete mind game between Haley and Jeff, Haley seeking revenge for the young girls he's abused and Jeff trying his hardest to get free.The film is brilliantly directed by David Slade, every frame holding and air of desperation and claustrophobia.  Add to that the tension between Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page and you have one of the most intense and gripping films I've seen in a long time.  The performances by these two are really the biggest key to making this film work for when they are the only people you see for almost two hours they can either draw you in or repel you.  I was drawn in, completely.As disturbing as some scenes can be (there's one scene in particular that would make any man squirm) the film is so engrossing the atrocity is easily forgiven.  `Hard Candy' is probably the best film I've seen yet this year, completely original and mind bending as it is brilliantly executed and completely entertaining from beginning to end.  Thanks to a smart script, brilliant plot and utterly amazing acting from the two leads we have been delivered `Hard Candy'.Page inhibits her character with enough confidence and maturity that she is absorbing in everyway, and Patrick switches back and forth through fear and aggression so well that you almost (I stress the word almost) feel bad for him.  Oh yeah, and the final frames of this film is so incredibly powerful and emotionally driven that you have no choice but to be completely engrossed and, for lack of a better word, touching.

Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson are spectacular; you can't take your eyes off them, even in the scenes where you desperately want to look away (and yes, there are a couple).

The movie flows along briskly; only two people for most of it, yet you never once get bored.  None of the movie seems extraneous; Sandra Oh's presence isn't at all necessary, yet as director David Slade explains in the extensive making-of featurette, it doesn't matter--everything is made to fit into the movie, so you never really care if it NEEDS to be there or not.I came to ""Hard Candy"" after reading reviews that praised the hell out of it.

645485,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,B00005JP3W,Dave,"[0, 1]","""Hard Candy"" is a movie that portrays a true sickness of content so well that it entices you to watch it through to the end.  I must admit that I have never seen a film like this before and through to its conclusion it raised a personal discomfort concerning my willingness to view the film in its entirety.  Without going into detail, the film is about the seduction of a young teenage girl by a man twice her age and the consequences of his intentions.  The story made me feel uneasy, but I felt just as uncomfortable about exposing a young teen actress to the story and its content.  I understand that the young actress, Ellen Page, has had other early experiences with somewhat similar difficult material, but that did not make me feel much better.The principal reason I was able to view this movie through to its conclusion was the acting ability of Ellen Page and how well she handled the sick story line of the film, which she carried out with a combination of innocence and a deep hatred and disgust for her ""seducer"".  The acting of these two main characters was excellent.I am not a real film buff and accordingly usually see a movie for its entertainment value with my wife and sometimes my kids who are in their late 20's.  This film in no way could be considered entertaining.  Its attractions are that of being an original story being extremely well executed and constantly keeping you in suspense that you will view something you do not want to view.  This is one movie that I did not see with any of my family members because I rented it on Amazon based upon very good reviews.  I did rate ""Hard Candy"" with 4 stars because of its overall quality.  However, in my opinion, the Amazon suggested scoring system does not work for films like this because it is supposed to be based on how much you like a film.  According to Amazon, a rating of 4 stars equates to the category of ""I like it"".  My rating of 4 stars was not based upon how much I liked the film because I did not like it.  My rating was based upon a rather crude assessment of the relative quality of contemporary films and accordingly 4 stars would mean that it was very good.  Lastly, I do not believe this film should be viewed by any person below their late teens and preferably later.  The content and cruelty of exhibited in the film may not be suitable in some circumstances for anyone regardless of age.  For example, my 87 year old mother would only become unnecessarily upset by viewing this film.",4,This film will leave you conflicted between a hate for its content and your ability to view it.,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,2484,"['Hard', 'Candy', 'movie', 'true', 'sickness', 'content', 'so', 'well', 'watch', 'end', 'must', 'admit', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'before', 'conclusion', 'raised', 'personal', 'discomfort', 'concerning', 'willingness', 'view', 'film', 'entirety', 'going', 'detail', 'film', 'seduction', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'man', 'twice', 'age', 'consequences', 'intentions', 'story', 'made', 'feel', 'uneasy', 'felt', 'just', 'uncomfortable', 'exposing', 'young', 'teen', 'actress', 'story', 'content', 'understand', 'young', 'actress', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'had', 'other', 'early', 'experiences', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'difficult', 'material', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'feel', 'much', 'better.The', 'principal', 'reason', 'was', 'able', 'view', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'was', 'acting', 'ability', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'how', 'well', 'handled', 'sick', 'story', 'line', 'film', 'carried', 'out', 'combination', 'innocence', 'deep', 'hatred', 'disgust', 'seducer', 'acting', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'excellent.I', 'am', 'not', 'real', 'film', 'buff', 'accordingly', 'usually', 'see', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'value', 'wife', 'sometimes', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'late', '20', 'film', 'way', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'entertaining', 'attractions', 'are', 'being', 'original', 'story', 'being', 'extremely', 'well', 'executed', 'constantly', 'keeping', 'suspense', 'will', 'view', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'view', 'one', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'family', 'members', 'rented', 'Amazon', 'based', 'very', 'good', 'reviews', 'did', 'rate', 'Hard', 'Candy', '4', 'stars', 'overall', 'quality', 'However', 'opinion', 'Amazon', 'suggested', 'scoring', 'system', 'not', 'work', 'films', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'According', 'Amazon', 'rating', '4', 'stars', 'category', 'like', 'rating', '4', 'stars', 'was', 'not', 'based', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'rating', 'was', 'based', 'rather', 'crude', 'assessment', 'relative', 'quality', 'contemporary', 'films', 'accordingly', '4', 'stars', 'would', 'mean', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Lastly', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'person', 'late', 'teens', 'preferably', 'later', 'content', 'cruelty', 'exhibited', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'circumstances', 'anyone', 'regardless', 'age', 'example', '87', 'year', 'old', 'mother', 'would', 'only', 'become', 'unnecessarily', 'upset', 'viewing', 'film']",N/A

Get it at Amazon.]***BEWARE SPOILERS******If you read this before seeing the movie, the movie will not be as interesting***This is a taunt drama of the man bites dog sort in which a precocious 14-year-old girl Hayley (Ellen Page, who was so delightful in Juno (2007)) has her way with photographer Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) a 32-year-old sickie who specializes in under aged girls.  And her way is...well, way extreme.  But apparently she has cause.The vibrant tension that glues us to our seats can only be resolved by finding out if she is right in her accusations or if he is an innocent victim.  She is certain.  But director David Slade (using a diabolical script from Brian Nelson) keeps us guessing.  Hayley seems not merely precocious intellectually, but emotionally more like a grown woman than a 14-year-old.  Jeff appears to be a sweet, clever guy any girl would love to love.  But she has anything but love in mind.  Her scheme of vengeance is well thought out and very well executed.  Everything is a twist on the Internet chat room stalker scenario.  Instead of the older dude seducing, drugging and taking advantage of the young girl, the young girl turns the tables on him in a horrifying way.  What is it that should happen to guys who take advantage of under-aged girls? They should have their ...s cut off.  That is exactly what Hayley has in mind.Or so it seems.  Actually, although she says at one point that death is too good for him, she finally settles on getting him to commit suicide.  But will he?I was hoping that Nelson and Slade would have the nerve to really turn the tables and make Hayley the villain and Jeff the innocent victim, and it seems for perhaps three-quarters of the film that this is still possible.  We learn that he does have a thing for under aged girls and that is not good, but it isn't enough to justify what he is going through and will go through.  And Hayley seems to be some kind of monster with a sick desire of her own.  But this all washes out when we discover that no he didn't actually kill the girl.  No, he only--as he confesses--FILMED the killing.  (Nice touch, that.)  And no Hayley does not go through with her Third Reich surgery (although she has brought along a blue surgeon's gown for the operation and has donned it).  That would make her just too, too unsavory.  Instead she uses her wiles and her physical and psychological control to get him to jump off a roof with a rope around his neck.  (Yes, I warned you about spoilers.)I mention all these essential details because I want to make a point.  This is a seduction of the audience film and a kind of black comedy that isn't funny until perhaps you see it for the second or third time--which I am not planning to do.  It is absurd in the slasher/horror film manner in which gross human behavior is depicted for the titillation of the audience while maintaining a politically correct stance.  A politically incorrect stance would have been to end the film with Jeff innocent and Hayley the sickie.  I suspect this film would have met with boycotts from women's groups had Slade done that.Still the violence is mostly imagined or alluded to.  Slade eschews any blood splattering or outright torture.  The balls in the garbage disposal are, after all, only in our imagination.  And Jeff really does deserve his fate.  However there is no getting around the fact that Hayley is not your everyday 14-year-old.  I don't think any future suitor would feel comfortable with her knowing what she did to Jeff, evil as he is.  In other words, her brand of vigilante justice could only come from somebody who was a bit sick herself.I think what mesmerized me most about this exercise in fantasy revenge wish fulfillment was the performance of Ellen Page.  I thought she was a bit creepy but very effective.  She actually could have passed for a 14-year-old (she was 18 when the film was released) yet the words put in her mouth and the actions she performed were well beyond the reach of the vast majority of fourteen year olds.  The intense close ups of her face and that of her co-star Patrick Wilson helped to make the characters larger than life, which is one of the things that film can do so very well.",3,"Totally sick, but compelling",1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,4360,"['[', 'Note', '500', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'book', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote', 'Get', 'Amazon', '***BEWARE', 'SPOILERS******If', 'read', 'seeing', 'movie', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'interesting***This', 'taunt', 'drama', 'man', 'dog', 'sort', 'precocious', '14-year-old', 'girl', 'Hayley', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'delightful', 'Juno', '2007', 'way', 'photographer', 'Jeff', 'Kohlver', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', '32-year-old', 'sickie', 'who', 'aged', 'girls', 'way', 'well', 'way', 'extreme', 'apparently', 'cause.The', 'vibrant', 'tension', 'seats', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'resolved', 'finding', 'out', 'right', 'accusations', 'innocent', 'victim', 'certain', 'director', 'David', 'Slade', 'using', 'diabolical', 'script', 'Brian', 'Nelson', 'guessing', 'Hayley', 'not', 'merely', 'precocious', 'intellectually', 'emotionally', 'more', 'grown', 'woman', '14-year-old', 'Jeff', 'be', 'sweet', 'clever', 'guy', 'girl', 'would', 'love', 'love', 'anything', 'love', 'mind', 'scheme', 'vengeance', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'Everything', 'twist', 'Internet', 'chat', 'room', 'stalker', 'scenario', 'Instead', 'older', 'dude', 'seducing', 'drugging', 'taking', 'advantage', 'young', 'girl', 'young', 'girl', 'tables', 'horrifying', 'way', 'What', 'should', 'happen', 'guys', 'who', 'take', 'advantage', 'under-aged', 'girls', 'should', 'have', 's', 'cut', 'off', 'exactly', 'what', 'Hayley', 'mind.Or', 'Actually', 'one', 'point', 'death', 'too', 'good', 'finally', 'getting', 'commit', 'suicide', 'will', 'was', 'hoping', 'Nelson', 'Slade', 'would', 'have', 'nerve', 'really', 'turn', 'tables', 'make', 'Hayley', 'villain', 'Jeff', 'innocent', 'victim', 'perhaps', 'three-quarters', 'film', 'still', 'possible', 'learn', 'have', 'thing', 'aged', 'girls', 'not', 'good', ""n't"", 'enough', 'justify', 'what', 'going', 'will', 'go', 'Hayley', 'be', 'kind', 'monster', 'sick', 'desire', 'own', 'washes', 'out', 'when', 'discover', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'kill', 'girl', 'No', 'only', 'killing', 'Nice', 'touch', 'Hayley', 'not', 'go', 'Third', 'Reich', 'surgery', 'brought', 'along', 'blue', 'surgeon', 'gown', 'operation', 'donned', 'would', 'make', 'just', 'too', 'too', 'unsavory', 'Instead', 'wiles', 'physical', 'psychological', 'control', 'get', 'jump', 'off', 'roof', 'rope', 'neck', 'Yes', 'warned', 'spoilers', 'mention', 'essential', 'details', 'want', 'make', 'point', 'seduction', 'audience', 'film', 'kind', 'black', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'funny', 'perhaps', 'see', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'am', 'not', 'planning', 'do', 'absurd', 'slasher/horror', 'film', 'manner', 'gross', 'human', 'behavior', 'depicted', 'titillation', 'audience', 'maintaining', 'politically', 'correct', 'stance', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'stance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'film', 'Jeff', 'innocent', 'Hayley', 'sickie', 'suspect', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'met', 'boycotts', 'women', 'groups', 'had', 'Slade', 'done', 'that.Still', 'violence', 'mostly', 'imagined', 'alluded', 'Slade', 'blood', 'splattering', 'outright', 'torture', 'balls', 'garbage', 'disposal', 'are', 'only', 'imagination', 'Jeff', 'really', 'deserve', 'fate', 'However', 'getting', 'fact', 'Hayley', 'not', 'everyday', '14-year-old', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'future', 'suitor', 'would', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'knowing', 'what', 'did', 'Jeff', 'evil', 'other', 'words', 'brand', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'could', 'only', 'come', 'somebody', 'who', 'was', 'bit', 'sick', 'herself.I', 'think', 'what', 'mesmerized', 'most', 'exercise', 'fantasy', 'revenge', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'was', 'performance', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'creepy', 'very', 'effective', 'actually', 'could', 'have', 'passed', '14-year-old', 'was', '18', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'yet', 'words', 'put', 'mouth', 'actions', 'performed', 'were', 'well', 'reach', 'vast', 'majority', 'fourteen', 'year', 'olds', 'intense', 'close', 'ups', 'face', 'co-star', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'helped', 'make', 'characters', 'larger', 'life', 'one', 'things', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'very', 'well']",N/A

645498,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B00005JP3W,Elisabeth,"[3, 4]","I've seen this movie twice so far and it's even better the second time around.  There's lots of foreshadowing in the beginning of the movie that was fun to notice again -- the ""missing child"" poster at the cafe, the playful questioning each other if faces can lie, and the toast where they announce they're going to ""take it all"".There's definitely a creepiness factor in this movie.  The movie starts out with a close-up of a computer screen and you see two people sending very sexy instant messages to each other.  You get the feeling that one person is a young teenager while the other is a much older adult.  When the two decide to meet at a cafe, your worst fears are confirmed.  A 30 something male is meeting a 14 year old girl.  ICK.Ellen Page was perfectly cast for this role because she has such a baby face and small physique.  As an audience member, you feel protective of her as she flirts lolita-style with him at the cafe.  Other details that highlight how small she is add to the creepiness of what this man is doing -- like when he buys her a shirt in size small or when she puts on his very large jacket.There are two main themes I noticed in this movie.  One theme is innocence.  An obvious example is that she's young, but there's also the innocence of guilt.  Throughout the film, the man, no matter what he does, keeps insisting to himself that he is a decent, good man.  The story he tells in the kitchen also pulls at your heartstrings a bit.  This movie definitely messes with you!Another theme has to do with deception.  As mentioned before, there was the deception of faces lying, but there's also the deception of the internet.  When you go on the internet, you can transform into anyone you want to be...but how honest is that image?  Also revealed are the deceptive means pedophiles use to lure their victims as well as the deceptive means victims use to free themselves from their captors.I was impressed with the imagery in this film.  I just like little details here and there, like the way the window blinds moved, kind of like the shutter of a camera.  A real good scene was when he stabbed the photo of a young woman he photographed...but most telling was WHERE on the picture he stabbed her.I also like the scene that's the first turning point in the film.  He's sitting on the couch, the scene goes a little blurry and you see something you're not quite sure if you saw right...and then the plot twist comes and you're taken on an edge-of-your-seat roller coaster ride.The audience will need to practice some suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie and if they can do that, this movie won't disappoint.  The performances are fair on Ellen Page's part (she tends to overact in some parts) and excellent on the male lead's part.  I was extremely impressed with his performance.Overall, loved this diabolical, clever and twistedly funny movie.",5,Something wicked this way comes,1258502400,"11 18, 2009",2009,2882,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'so', 'far', 'even', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'lots', 'foreshadowing', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'notice', 'again', 'missing', 'child', 'poster', 'cafe', 'playful', 'questioning', 'other', 'can', 'lie', 'toast', 'where', 'announce', ""'re"", 'going', 'take', 'definitely', 'creepiness', 'factor', 'movie', 'movie', 'out', 'close-up', 'computer', 'screen', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'sending', 'very', 'sexy', 'instant', 'messages', 'other', 'get', 'feeling', 'one', 'person', 'young', 'teenager', 'other', 'much', 'older', 'adult', 'When', 'two', 'decide', 'meet', 'cafe', 'worst', 'fears', 'are', 'confirmed', '30', 'something', 'male', 'meeting', '14', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'ICK.Ellen', 'Page', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'baby', 'face', 'small', 'physique', 'audience', 'member', 'feel', 'protective', 'lolita-style', 'cafe', 'Other', 'details', 'highlight', 'how', 'small', 'add', 'creepiness', 'what', 'man', 'doing', 'when', 'shirt', 'size', 'small', 'when', 'very', 'large', 'jacket.There', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'themes', 'noticed', 'movie', 'One', 'theme', 'innocence', 'obvious', 'example', 'young', 'also', 'innocence', 'guilt', 'film', 'man', 'matter', 'what', 'keeps', 'insisting', 'decent', 'good', 'man', 'story', 'kitchen', 'also', 'heartstrings', 'bit', 'movie', 'definitely', 'theme', 'do', 'deception', 'mentioned', 'was', 'deception', 'lying', 'also', 'deception', 'internet', 'When', 'go', 'internet', 'can', 'transform', 'anyone', 'want', 'be', 'how', 'honest', 'image', 'Also', 'revealed', 'are', 'deceptive', 'means', 'pedophiles', 'use', 'lure', 'victims', 'as', 'well', 'deceptive', 'means', 'victims', 'use', 'free', 'captors.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'imagery', 'film', 'just', 'little', 'details', 'here', 'there', 'way', 'window', 'moved', 'kind', 'shutter', 'camera', 'real', 'good', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'stabbed', 'photo', 'young', 'woman', 'photographed', 'most', 'telling', 'was', 'WHERE', 'picture', 'stabbed', 'her.I', 'also', 'scene', 'first', 'turning', 'point', 'film', 'sitting', 'couch', 'scene', 'little', 'blurry', 'see', 'something', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'saw', 'right', 'then', 'plot', 'twist', ""'re"", 'taken', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride.The', 'audience', 'will', 'need', 'practice', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'can', 'do', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'performances', 'are', 'fair', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'part', 'overact', 'parts', 'excellent', 'male', 'lead', 'part', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'performance.Overall', 'loved', 'diabolical', 'clever', 'twistedly', 'funny', 'movie']",N/A

With patience, the director and actors set up the premise--deceptively simple on the surface. A thirty-something photographer agrees to meet a fourteen-year-old female at a local shop. She plays coy, curious, and sophisticated to his standoffish, yet asking-for-trouble behavior. On the wall, we spot a ""Missing"" poster for a young woman. Soon, Jeff and Haley head for his home in the rich hills of L.A. And the fun begins.I knew beforehand that the movie dealt with a man and a teenager. I expected her to become the victim who fights back. She is that. But she is one step ahead. With skillful dialogue and clues, the script refuses to give things away too soon. Is Jeff a kidnapper, a molester, a killer? Is Haley merely caught up in adolescent hormones and fantasy? Despite an R rating, ""Hard Candy"" shows respect for the themes and ideas it explores, never objectifying young women. We see no skin. We are pulled into this vengefully-seasoned tale, wondering who is guilty and what punishment is justified.In a world where films often go to extremes, feeding us poison to warn against the use of poison, ""Hard Candy"" sidesteps that mistake and stays almost myopically focused on its purpose. The acting is superb on both parts. There are some loose ends (a nosy neighbor who has nothing to do with the outcome) and some psychological ploys a little too edgy for a young teen.

Note how the girl's face is not visible on the cover, because she is not very attractive, and by no means ""Hard Candy"" at all.It would be like having a movie titled ""Rock Concert"" and a photo of electric guitars and drums on a stage, and then the movie is actually about a classical pianist who teaches us all about how wrong it is to listen to rock music and goes around killing people who listen to Rock.Basically, here you have a movie disguised as one that will be about some real hot girl, and instead you have a homely looking ""tom boy"" (short hair and looks like a boy) that uses the internet to entice and trap a poor guy into meeting her, then she tricks him into taking her to his house, after he insisted it was not a good idea.  She drugs him, ties him up and commits the most criminal acts of torture that makes Abu Ghraib look like a vacation resort in comparison.In real life, the guy would have yelled out for help when he had the chance when he was outside the house, and had this girl put away in prison, but instead, he decides to hang himself because she talks him into it?  His crime was trying to be a friend to someone so homely that she couldn't get any dates or attention from anyone else, and to reward him for his kindness, she puts him through the horror of having his sack cut off and puting it down the garbage disposal?One of the directors or producers of the film, in one of the extra feature interviews provided on the DVD, admits that this movie has outraged so many people (he claims at least 25%) enough to write and complain about it.  He actually then takes that as a compliment and takes pride in the fact the movie angered so many people, saying if the movie could provide so much emotion in people, then it is a success.Anyone can produce a movie that outrages people, that doesn't take any talent, good acting, interesting story line, or effort at all.Now make a movie that has everyone praising it, and you have something.",1,Not what you think it is!

645509,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B00005JP3W,Genevieve Hayes,"[0, 1]","""Hard Candy"" takes the notion of young girls in chat rooms being the prey of pedophiles and turns it on its head by having a young girl stalking pedophiles in chat rooms. At the start of this film, 14 year old Hayley (Ellen Page) meets up with 30 year old Jeff (Patrick Wilson), a man she met in a chat room, but rather than becoming yet another victim of child abuse, Hayley takes matters into her own hands, and pretty soon it's Jeff who's begging for mercy and not Hayley.""Hard Candy"" is not the sort of film you watch for fun. In spite of what you might have read in other reviews, this is not another gore-porn (there is actually very little blood in the film), but from a psychological point of view, it is a difficult movie to watch. While watching this film I saw nothing on screen to make me feel nauseous, and yet at several points I found my hand hovering over the remote because thinking about what was happening, from both characters' points of view, was just too much for me. I'm glad that I did continue, however (for the record, if you can get past a certain scene, that you have probably heard about, in the middle of the film, then you shouldn't have trouble making it to the end), because the ideas raised by this film are very interesting and the concept is possibly the most original that I have heard in a long time.This film is not without faults, however. One of the main drawbacks of this film is that the characters are impossible for an ordinary person to identify with, or to even sympathize with. It's essentially a two-role film and one of those roles is a pedophile and the other a psychopath. A second drawback is that Patrick Wilson's character spends most of the film tied up and he just isn't a good enough actor to pull it off, nor is the dialogue written for him while tied up strong enough for him to hold his own against Page's psycho. A third drawback is that the characters are clich&eacute;s. Jeff is your ""typical"" pedophile and Hayley is your ""typical"" victim-turned-aggressor. I found myself comparing this film to ""Happiness"", another film with a pedophile character, and I found the latter to be the better and the far more disturbing film because in ""Happiness"", writer Todd Solondz did not fall victim to the clich&eacute;s that ""Hard Candy""s writer, Brian Nelson, did.Overall, I recommend this film, albeit conditionally. If you think that you can handle the themes, then it's worth watching for the questions it raises, but if the concept isn't your cup of tea, then don't feel bad about giving it a miss, because it's not something that I would class as essential viewing.",3,"A good film, but impossible to identify with",1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,2624,"['Hard', 'Candy', 'notion', 'young', 'girls', 'chat', 'rooms', 'being', 'prey', 'pedophiles', 'head', 'having', 'young', 'girl', 'stalking', 'pedophiles', 'rooms', 'start', 'film', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Hayley', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'up', '30', 'year', 'old', 'Jeff', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'man', 'met', 'chat', 'room', 'rather', 'becoming', 'yet', 'victim', 'child', 'abuse', 'Hayley', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'pretty', 'soon', 'Jeff', 'who', 'begging', 'mercy', 'not', 'Hayley', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'not', 'sort', 'film', 'watch', 'fun', 'spite', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'not', 'gore-porn', 'actually', 'very', 'little', 'blood', 'film', 'psychological', 'point', 'view', 'difficult', 'movie', 'watch', 'watching', 'film', 'saw', 'nothing', 'screen', 'make', 'feel', 'nauseous', 'yet', 'several', 'points', 'found', 'hand', 'hovering', 'remote', 'thinking', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'characters', 'points', 'view', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'continue', 'however', 'record', 'can', 'get', 'certain', 'scene', 'have', 'probably', 'heard', 'about', 'middle', 'film', 'then', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'trouble', 'making', 'end', 'ideas', 'raised', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'concept', 'possibly', 'most', 'original', 'have', 'heard', 'long', 'time.This', 'film', 'not', 'faults', 'however', 'One', 'main', 'drawbacks', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'impossible', 'ordinary', 'person', 'identify', 'even', 'sympathize', 'essentially', 'two-role', 'film', 'one', 'roles', 'pedophile', 'other', 'psychopath', 'second', 'drawback', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'character', 'most', 'film', 'tied', 'up', 'just', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'actor', 'pull', 'off', 'dialogue', 'written', 'tied', 'up', 'strong', 'enough', 'hold', 'own', 'Page', 'psycho', 'third', 'drawback', 'characters', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Jeff', 'typical', 'pedophile', 'Hayley', 'typical', 'victim-turned-aggressor', 'found', 'comparing', 'film', 'Happiness', 'film', 'pedophile', 'character', 'found', 'latter', 'be', 'better', 'far', 'more', 'disturbing', 'film', 'Happiness', 'writer', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'did', 'not', 'fall', 'victim', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Hard', 'Candy', 's', 'writer', 'Brian', 'Nelson', 'did.Overall', 'recommend', 'film', 'conditionally', 'think', 'can', 'handle', 'themes', 'then', 'worth', 'watching', 'questions', 'concept', ""n't"", 'cup', 'tea', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'bad', 'giving', 'miss', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'class', 'essential', 'viewing']",N/A

645513,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JP3W,Grady Harp,"[1, 3]","HARD CANDY is one of those films that took enormous courage on the part of the writer (Brian Nelson), director (David Slade), and producers - let alone the actors - to bring a tale of pedophilia to the mainstream audience.  Made for a small budget (yet the production values are so very artistic that it feels like an expensive film), HARD CANDY is essentially a duet for two actors: the actors Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson deliver performances that become indelibly burned on the mind of the viewer.32-year old photographer Jeff has been chatting online with 14-year old Haley for three weeks using standard chatroom seduction lines.  They meet, talk, seem to get along well - until Haley invites herself to Jeff's home, much against Jeff's better judgment.  Once home the beautiful space in which Jeff lives (the set decor is splendid, using sensitive colors in a cinematic way), the walls adorned with photographs of young models, seems a fitting space for a fine photographer.  But soon the twist of the story explodes and Haley lets Jeff know that she is there to punish him for his pedophilia and for some specific events in his history.  She drugs him, and when he awakens Jeff is the captive, forced to undergo the intensive questioning and innuendoes from Haley, including being set up for castration.  The tension mounts to a peak as the two characters uncover aspects of each other; the final resolution of the long encounter comes as a stunning surprise.The quality of the film is so fine that no judgments are made: is Jeff truly a criminal pedophile?, is Haley insane?, can this reversal of roles happen?  The script is so beautifully written that it remains intelligent and straight, forcing the viewer to become involved in the quest for truth.  Ellen Page delivers a brilliant performance as Haley and Patrick Wilson steps out of his usual milk toast roles to create a man driven by strange needs who gradually comes to a point of self acceptance in one of the more powerful scenes of film this viewer has seen.The audience for this examination of pedophilia may be small and therein lies the pity. This is a film that deals with a tough subject so very well that the viewer gains an understanding into dysfunctional characteristics while being caught up in a suspenseful thriller of a story.  This is independent film making at its best.

645514,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B00005JP3W,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[0, 0]","That's what the film boils down to. Whenever I hear the words ""amazing"" and ""great"" about a movie I know that's either bogus, or highly exaggerated. ""Hard Candy"" fell in the middle of this. I thought it was a good movie but overrated.The plot isn't original nor are the characters. One victim or crusader targets a sick pedophile who she suspects of abducting, sexually abusing young girls and probably killing one.However, her crusade with the pedophile is more of an obsession, a sick obsession. How sick we find out in the movie (castration, hanging, even planting evidence).Like I said revenge flicks aren't anything new and so right there my grade for this movie dropped of a bit. Also some people described this as a cat and mouse game but I disagree. While there one or two scenes where Jeff gets away,  we all know he won't. The film is totally dominated by Hayley (Ellen Page) too much to the point where I wasn't surprised by anything. With the story around Jeff,hey could have played around more with him being innocent especially (as they did briefly during the end). It would have made for a better twist seeing the victim actually be worse than the sicko. They did do this for first thirty minutes but then forego the idea for a lot of simulated torture instead.Now on to the performance they were great no doubt. Ellen Page dominates the screen and she really comes across as veteran here. Patrick Wilson was great as Jeff. The directing by David Slade was good.Again this is a good movie but for me it's hardly amazing. It's also one of those films that  for me, I'll watch one but it would hardly come up in conversation.

645520,A3O60C5513YYD6,B00005JP3W,H. J. Spivack,"[1, 4]","Just watched this movie last night and I think its the best horror thriller I've seen in years, maybe even a decade. I can't get it out of my mind. I expect I'll revisit this one again over the years, find nuances that I missed or forgot since the last time. I know I'll see its star again. She was marvelous.Its premise is simple enough. A predator meets a 14 year old for coffee after chatting her up in internet chat rooms.  In the coffee shop, there's notice of a missing girl. He has a cd she wants to hear and she goes home with him and that, 5 minutes into the flick, was the last predicatable thing in the movie. I don't want to go into more, just that if it was me who was in that situation, I'd never have had a chance. That's not a spoiler, but if you think it might be, you need to see the movie.The breakout star of the movie is a Canadian actress named Ellen Page, who played Kitty Pryde in the last Xmen movie. If you thought her character was slippery then...that was nothing as to her part in the movie. It was unforgettable, such a fierce, strong role. Although she plays 14 in the movie, she was 19 when she filmed it. That's a small comfort in that she is attractive and smart in a very attractive way. To find out she's 19 is only small comfort however as she is still not legal age and that is the topic of the movie. It may be the director's trope that draws the men in the audience. They want to cozen her and that puts you in the predator's shoes.To talk of the movie's technical competence, it is filmed in close to extreme closeup. The cinematographer does such an extraordinary job of capturing nuance that I wondor how much of it was directed vs how it was shot. The colors (a lot of primary colors, particularly in the beginning of the movie) represent almost a separate person in the movie, conveying mood and foreshadowing in equal measure. Pay attention...clearly the producers/director did not have much of a budget and they put every dime on the screen. A few of the shots were stunning.This is not an easy movie to watch. Its squirm inducing and some might argue that its not horror. I answer by repeating.

So this review is going to be far less detailed because I just don't want to type up all those thoughts over again.Hard Candy is a really frustrating film because it could have been a great one. The premise is a grabber and the actors are very talented and game, but the problem is that the script just collapses as the movie goes on. The fatal flaw is that the writers suddenly decide about halfway through that Hayley is going to be a genius mastermind figure, instead of the precocious, ambitious, more or less realistic girl she starts out as.Mastermind figures in suspense movies are useful to writers because they always are one step ahead of everybody else.  So they can set up diabolical schemes and traps simply to torment their victims and generate lots of suspense for the audience.  Since they know what people will do ahead of time, they know how to stage these traps to maximize drama, to make their victims think they have the upper hand, but they are always in control and pull the rug out from under at the last minute. Why do they do all this?  Well, because they are supergenius masterminds and they like to mess with people, to put them through the ringer. Now, an omniscient supergenius in a movie like in Saw, for example, is fine given the limited ambitions of Saw (and don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Saw). But here, in a movie that should have had ambitions to be more than a generic thrill machine, it is just the wrong thing to do and particularly when you are talking about a 14 year old protagonist. And so, the last half of the movie is filled with completely implausible and virtually impossible plot developments all meant just to milk a few more manipulative thrills from the basic set up. Think hard about virtually any of the situations in the second half and ask yourself *why* Jeff or Hayley do certain things and how or why Hayley would bother to orchestrate these narrative events to occur if she knew from the start all the things she is revealed to know at the end. Once you start to question, you realize how completely overengineered the plot twists are.The bottom line is that the writing is fundamentally lazy and the narrative events stunningly arbitrary, which is a serious disappointment given the potential this idea had.",2,bad execution of a good idea,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,2393,"['tried', 'ages', 'ago', 'post', 'lengthy', 'mostly', 'critical', 'review', 'reason', 'never', 'made', 'up', 'hmmmmm', 'review', 'going', 'be', 'far', 'less', 'detailed', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'type', 'up', 'thoughts', 'again.Hard', 'Candy', 'really', 'frustrating', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'one', 'premise', 'grabber', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'talented', 'game', 'problem', 'script', 'just', 'movie', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'writers', 'suddenly', 'decide', 'halfway', 'Hayley', 'going', 'be', 'genius', 'mastermind', 'figure', 'instead', 'precocious', 'ambitious', 'more', 'less', 'realistic', 'girl', 'out', 'as.Mastermind', 'figures', 'suspense', 'movies', 'are', 'useful', 'writers', 'always', 'are', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'everybody', 'else', 'can', 'set', 'up', 'diabolical', 'schemes', 'traps', 'simply', 'torment', 'victims', 'generate', 'lots', 'suspense', 'audience', 'know', 'what', 'people', 'will', 'do', 'ahead', 'time', 'know', 'how', 'stage', 'traps', 'maximize', 'drama', 'make', 'victims', 'think', 'have', 'upper', 'hand', 'are', 'always', 'control', 'pull', 'rug', 'last', 'minute', 'Why', 'do', 'do', 'Well', 'are', 'supergenius', 'masterminds', 'like', 'mess', 'people', 'put', 'ringer', 'Now', 'omniscient', 'supergenius', 'movie', 'Saw', 'example', 'fine', 'given', 'limited', 'ambitions', 'Saw', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'enjoyed', 'Saw', 'here', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'ambitions', 'be', 'more', 'generic', 'thrill', 'machine', 'just', 'wrong', 'thing', 'do', 'particularly', 'when', 'are', 'talking', '14', 'year', 'old', 'protagonist', 'so', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'filled', 'completely', 'implausible', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'plot', 'developments', 'meant', 'just', 'milk', 'few', 'more', 'manipulative', 'thrills', 'basic', 'set', 'up', 'Think', 'hard', 'virtually', 'situations', 'second', 'half', 'ask', '*why*', 'Jeff', 'Hayley', 'do', 'certain', 'things', 'how', 'why', 'Hayley', 'would', 'bother', 'orchestrate', 'narrative', 'events', 'occur', 'knew', 'start', 'things', 'revealed', 'know', 'end', 'start', 'question', 'realize', 'how', 'completely', 'overengineered', 'plot', 'are.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'writing', 'fundamentally', 'lazy', 'narrative', 'events', 'stunningly', 'arbitrary', 'serious', 'disappointment', 'given', 'potential', 'idea', 'had']",N/A

In nature, we all have preconceived notions about roles of weakness and strength during confrontation.  The same holds true for humanity, which is why we love an underdog.  Hard Candy flips that concept on its head, sociopathically displaying that the concepts of predator and prey are interchangeable.When Jeff (Patrick Wilson), a 32-year old photographer, begins chatting online with precocious 14-year old Haley (Ellen Page), the interaction has every indication of something creepy; the situation is just wrong.  When they meet up for coffee, an uneasiness exudes from every table, chair, and fiber of their surroundings.  After some conversation in which Haley displays a maturity and intellect rivaling Jeff, the two make their way back to Jeff's apartment; it's difficult to ascertain who persuades whom.Foreboding and disturbing, the setting quickly illustrates how easily an adult could take advantage of a child; and when alcohol becomes involved, it becomes very clear that despite Jeff's seemingly clean-cut image, he definitely fits the mold of a pedophile.  Little does anyone know that young Haley is not quite as vulnerable as first impressions indicate.The rest of the movie is a battle of minds and will-power, as Haley transforms into a scalpel-slinging psycho, while Jeff attempts at psychobabble only dig his hole deeper and deeper.  The emotional range each displays is mesmerizing.  Haley's actions grow more and more sadistic; at more than one point she admits to being insane.  Meanwhile, Jeff ping-pongs between bleak denial, hopeless sorrow, and fiery rage while under the tormenting teenager's control.Amidst exploitation, asphyxiation, and castration, Haley's glee dances on Jeff's growing despair, and the audience must attempt to weigh the merits of vigilante justice against its inevitable depravity.  Whereas Miike'sAuditiontreated it as an afterthought, the justification for Haley's actions is a common theme in the dialogue - but only a small part of the overall captivating script.  The suspenseful, mental sparring, where Jeff's witty pleading is consistently met with clever repartees from the erudite Haley, is something to behold.  The pacing, camera-work, and directing are minimal, accentuating the feeling of isolation, heightening the psychological maze slowly woven between the two characters - who are responsible for carrying 99% of the movie - and allowing for the exposure of countless emotional layers.This is the epitome if what psycho-thriller should be.  It's clearly the Americanized version - not nearly as much build-up, and quite a bit more ""interaction"" - of Audition, and aside from a questionable resolution (better choices are available for Jeff), it's highly recommended...on an empty stomach.",4,The Americanized Audition,1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,2887,"['Have', 'ever', 'seen', 'internet', 'video', 'bird', 'getting', 'eaten', 'ninja', 'turtle', 'one', 'where', 'octopus', 'shark', 'nature', 'have', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'roles', 'weakness', 'strength', 'confrontation', 'same', 'true', 'humanity', 'why', 'love', 'underdog', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'concept', 'head', 'sociopathically', 'displaying', 'concepts', 'predator', 'prey', 'are', 'interchangeable.When', 'Jeff', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', '32-year', 'old', 'photographer', 'chatting', 'online', 'precocious', '14-year', 'old', 'Haley', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'interaction', 'indication', 'something', 'creepy', 'situation', 'just', 'wrong', 'When', 'meet', 'up', 'coffee', 'uneasiness', 'exudes', 'table', 'chair', 'fiber', 'surroundings', 'conversation', 'Haley', 'maturity', 'intellect', 'rivaling', 'Jeff', 'two', 'make', 'way', 'back', 'Jeff', 'apartment', 'difficult', 'ascertain', 'who', 'whom.Foreboding', 'disturbing', 'setting', 'quickly', 'how', 'easily', 'adult', 'could', 'take', 'advantage', 'child', 'when', 'alcohol', 'involved', 'very', 'clear', 'Jeff', 'seemingly', 'clean-cut', 'image', 'definitely', 'mold', 'pedophile', 'Little', 'anyone', 'know', 'young', 'Haley', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'vulnerable', 'first', 'impressions', 'indicate.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'battle', 'minds', 'will-power', 'Haley', 'scalpel-slinging', 'psycho', 'Jeff', 'attempts', 'psychobabble', 'only', 'hole', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'emotional', 'range', 'displays', 'mesmerizing', 'Haley', 'actions', 'grow', 'more', 'more', 'sadistic', 'more', 'one', 'point', 'being', 'insane', 'Meanwhile', 'Jeff', 'ping-pongs', 'bleak', 'denial', 'hopeless', 'sorrow', 'fiery', 'rage', 'tormenting', 'teenager', 'control.Amidst', 'exploitation', 'asphyxiation', 'castration', 'Haley', 'glee', 'dances', 'Jeff', 'growing', 'despair', 'audience', 'must', 'attempt', 'weigh', 'merits', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'inevitable', 'depravity', 'Whereas', ""Miike'sAuditiontreated"", 'afterthought', 'justification', 'Haley', 'actions', 'common', 'theme', 'dialogue', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'overall', 'captivating', 'script', 'suspenseful', 'mental', 'sparring', 'where', 'Jeff', 'witty', 'pleading', 'consistently', 'met', 'clever', 'repartees', 'erudite', 'Haley', 'something', 'behold', 'pacing', 'camera-work', 'directing', 'are', 'minimal', 'accentuating', 'feeling', 'isolation', 'heightening', 'psychological', 'maze', 'slowly', 'woven', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'responsible', 'carrying', '99', '%', 'movie', 'allowing', 'exposure', 'countless', 'emotional', 'layers.This', 'epitome', 'what', 'psycho-thriller', 'should', 'be', 'clearly', 'Americanized', 'version', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'build-up', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'interaction', 'Audition', 'aside', 'questionable', 'resolution', 'better', 'choices', 'are', 'available', 'Jeff', 'highly', 'recommended', 'empty', 'stomach']",N/A
645528,A2VRAT69JDAD3W,B00005JP3W,"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister""","[1, 4]","Hard Candy is a film that takes many risks.  And more often than not those risks pay off big.  Without giving too much away, this film tackles timely societal taboos and stereotypes that likely rendered it unmarketable to mainsteam theaters, thus preventing a wide release.  But do not allow those factors to deter you from seeing this film.  Hard Candy is at once original, thought provoking, intense and riveting.  It is the sort of film that grabs your attention immediately and DEMANDS that you keep watching no matter how difficult the journey promises to become.The plot is quite simple really.  It involves a 32 year old fashion photographer and the 14 year old girl he has been chatting with on the internet for several weeks.  They hit it off well enough and agree to meet at a coffee shop to ""get to know each other better"".  Now if you've seen Dateline NBC lately then you know this creepy scenario is all too real to life.  For the viewer, their first meeting is a very unsettling yet very effective scene where in fact they do nothing more than talk to one another.  Hard Candy is the rare film that culls its intensity more from what it chooses not to show rather than from extreme graphic content.Which brings me to an important point.  Those who may be apprehensive about the film's content...rest assured that Hard Candy handles the subject matter wihout gratuitousness or graphic sexual content.  Much to it's credit, Hard Candy isn't out to shock us with glimpses of extreme sexual perversion.  As such it never devolves into a ""by the numbers"" depiction of the anatomy of a sexual predator.

645530,A3G3JAEV0B0VQ6,B00005JP3W,"J. C. Friedlander ""HorrorFan.""","[23, 31]","This movie started off well enough.A 14 year old meets a 32 year old man from the Internet and they arrange for her to go to his house.  But when they get there, her sinister motives are revealed.This storyline had potential at the start, however as the movie progressed I found it to be quite trite.  (Spoiler information may be revealed below).Hayley apparently acts on a belief, which seems a little bit ridiculous.  She did not start out with any real proof to begin with and had to rip through the house to get it.  What would have happened if Jeff had turned out to be a good guy?  What would she have done?The movie got boring for me after about 30 minutes because Hayley and Jeff prattled on the same topics endlessly.  I understand that he's a pervert and she's a sicko, and both of them believe they are in the right.  Get to the point, already.  We really don't need hundreds of statements about how clever she is and how stupid he is.Hayley claimed to have done something quite disgusting to Jeff, and later on, he found out that she'd faked it.  What was the point of all that, then?Jeff managed to escape from Hayley at least three or four times, yet every single time he escaped, then he walked back into her trap.  How many times did he get knocked out again?Hayley's plan was ridiculous.  After all the fighting where Jeff was tied up and they beat each other up...She would never be able to get rid of the evidence after that.An autospy would have identified that there were previously drugs in Jeff's body.  Hayley's fingerprints would be all over him.  There would be rope burns on various marks of the body, showing that he had been tied up for some time.  Not to mention hair, blood and all the other gunk Hayley left lying around.  I mean, she was showering there.  Come on.Let's not forget that the neighbour had seen Hayley who told her she'd be there for a couple of days.  She'd tell the police about that and provide an accurate profile.Plus the people at the shopping center who saw them together.At the end Hayley was on the roof and Joelle was in the house.  As far as I can see Hayley had no time to remove the evidence because Jeff was chasing her all over the house.  How did she expect to clear up with Joelle right there.  Come to think of it, how was she going to get off the roof without anyone seeing her.E-mails and calls can easily be traced, showing that the 'police calls' were fake.So, Hayley would never have gotten away.  In fact, Jeff didn't even have to kill himself.  If he'd finished her off, he could easily remove his side of the evidence and show the police the marks on her body and such.  For an ""honor student,"" she was really stupid.Both characters seemed to be overwhelemingly stupid in the sense that neither one of them knew what they were doing.A much better ending would be if Jeff had revealed to Hayley that he wasn't alone and have the other guy turn up and finish her off as part of the set up.  And it would have been better if he reveals he knew who she was all along.I got so bored with the long, long conversations that had no point to them, I skipped over a few scenes.A disappointment all around.",2,Disappointing...,1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,3168,"['movie', 'started', 'off', 'well', 'enough.A', '14', 'year', 'old', '32', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'Internet', 'arrange', 'go', 'house', 'when', 'get', 'there', 'sinister', 'motives', 'are', 'revealed.This', 'storyline', 'had', 'potential', 'start', 'however', 'movie', 'progressed', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'trite', 'Spoiler', 'information', 'may', 'be', 'revealed', '.Hayley', 'apparently', 'belief', 'little', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'did', 'not', 'start', 'out', 'real', 'proof', 'begin', 'had', 'rip', 'house', 'get', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'Jeff', 'had', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'guy', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'movie', 'got', 'boring', '30', 'minutes', 'Hayley', 'Jeff', 'prattled', 'same', 'topics', 'endlessly', 'understand', 'pervert', 'sicko', 'believe', 'are', 'right', 'Get', 'point', 'already', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'hundreds', 'statements', 'how', 'clever', 'how', 'stupid', 'claimed', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'quite', 'disgusting', 'Jeff', 'later', 'found', 'out', ""'d"", 'faked', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'then', 'Jeff', 'managed', 'escape', 'Hayley', 'least', 'three', 'four', 'times', 'yet', 'single', 'time', 'escaped', 'then', 'walked', 'back', 'trap', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'get', 'knocked', 'out', 'again', 'Hayley', 'plan', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'fighting', 'where', 'Jeff', 'was', 'tied', 'up', 'beat', 'other', 'up', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'rid', 'evidence', 'that.An', 'autospy', 'would', 'have', 'identified', 'were', 'previously', 'drugs', 'Jeff', 'body', 'Hayley', 'fingerprints', 'would', 'be', 'would', 'be', 'rope', 'burns', 'various', 'marks', 'body', 'showing', 'had', 'been', 'tied', 'up', 'time', 'Not', 'mention', 'hair', 'blood', 'other', 'gunk', 'Hayley', 'left', 'lying', 'around', 'mean', 'was', 'showering', 'there', 'Come', 'on.Let', 'not', 'forget', 'neighbour', 'had', 'seen', 'Hayley', 'who', 'told', ""'d"", 'be', 'there', 'couple', 'days', ""'d"", 'tell', 'police', 'provide', 'accurate', 'profile.Plus', 'people', 'shopping', 'center', 'who', 'saw', 'together.At', 'end', 'Hayley', 'was', 'roof', 'Joelle', 'was', 'house', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'Hayley', 'had', 'time', 'remove', 'evidence', 'Jeff', 'was', 'chasing', 'house', 'How', 'did', 'expect', 'clear', 'up', 'Joelle', 'right', 'there', 'Come', 'think', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'off', 'roof', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'her.E-mails', 'calls', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'traced', 'showing', ""'police"", 'calls', 'were', 'fake.So', 'Hayley', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'fact', 'Jeff', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'kill', ""'d"", 'finished', 'off', 'could', 'easily', 'remove', 'side', 'evidence', 'show', 'police', 'marks', 'body', 'such', 'honor', 'student', 'was', 'really', 'stupid.Both', 'characters', 'seemed', 'be', 'overwhelemingly', 'stupid', 'sense', 'one', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing.A', 'much', 'better', 'ending', 'would', 'be', 'Jeff', 'had', 'revealed', 'Hayley', 'was', ""n't"", 'alone', 'have', 'other', 'guy', 'turn', 'up', 'finish', 'off', 'part', 'set', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'knew', 'who', 'was', 'along.I', 'got', 'so', 'bored', 'long', 'long', 'conversations', 'had', 'point', 'skipped', 'few', 'scenes.A', 'disappointment']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[3, 5]","The topic of pedophile has been revisited once again; following the recent slew of similarly-themed shows like the `Woodsman' and `Mysterious Skin.' But this time round, pedophile isn't the theme of the show; it is simply a cat-and-mouse-ish thriller between a teenage girl and a suspected pedophile. This movie is dark; hell, what story about pedophile wouldn't be, and the acting is nothing short of excellent. Both characters are extremely convincing and both shock in their respective ways. Brian Nelson's intelligent script is abound with surprising twists, dark humor and bitter exchanges which will provoke discussions among viewers.Hayley (Ellen Page) is convincing as the teenage girl with a vigilante agenda, and Jeff (ambiguous Patrick Wilson) is good as well. The characters that they portray just don't seem to be very realistic in this film. A teenage girl endangering her life into a pedophiles house just to expose his dark secret? This film also features some truly disturbing scenes but nothing explicit. The flaw that I have with this film is that I'm not sure exactly who the makers wanted us to root for, because the girl is portrayed as mildly unhinged and explicitly psychotic, while the alleged pedophile comes across as the victim. Surely if he's the bad guy, we want the girl to succeed and to truly torment him, but in this film we are forced to side with the pedophile which is quite disturbing to me.However, overlooking this is the simple fact that for the performances alone and the quality of the considered direction giving us some heart-pounding suspense. `Hard Candy' is a fine piece of cinema that offers a great deal in comparison to other movies produced nowadays and deserves a view.",4,This Candy is Hard to Swallow.,1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,1722,"['topic', 'pedophile', 'been', 'revisited', 'once', 'again', 'following', 'recent', 'slew', 'similarly-themed', 'shows', 'Woodsman', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'time', 'round', 'pedophile', ""n't"", 'theme', 'show', 'simply', 'cat-and-mouse-ish', 'thriller', 'teenage', 'girl', 'suspected', 'pedophile', 'movie', 'dark', 'hell', 'what', 'story', 'pedophile', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'acting', 'nothing', 'short', 'excellent', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'convincing', 'shock', 'respective', 'ways', 'Brian', 'Nelson', 'intelligent', 'script', 'abound', 'surprising', 'twists', 'dark', 'humor', 'bitter', 'exchanges', 'will', 'provoke', 'discussions', 'viewers.Hayley', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'convincing', 'teenage', 'girl', 'vigilante', 'agenda', 'Jeff', 'ambiguous', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'portray', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'realistic', 'film', 'teenage', 'girl', 'endangering', 'life', 'pedophiles', 'house', 'just', 'expose', 'dark', 'secret', 'film', 'also', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'explicit', 'flaw', 'have', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'who', 'makers', 'wanted', 'root', 'girl', 'portrayed', 'mildly', 'unhinged', 'explicitly', 'psychotic', 'alleged', 'pedophile', 'victim', 'Surely', 'bad', 'guy', 'want', 'girl', 'succeed', 'truly', 'torment', 'film', 'are', 'forced', 'side', 'pedophile', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'me.However', 'overlooking', 'simple', 'fact', 'performances', 'alone', 'quality', 'considered', 'direction', 'giving', 'heart-pounding', 'suspense', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'fine', 'piece', 'cinema', 'great', 'deal', 'comparison', 'other', 'movies', 'produced', 'nowadays', 'view']",N/A
645534,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00005JP3W,J from NY,"[0, 2]","David Slade's ""Hard Candy"" is the last thing I expected on a Saturday afternoon--the smothering, almost unbearable atmosphere of psychological terror rivals some of the best of this genre that I have ever seen, and that includes some of the work of Ingmar Bergman.  This film certainly suffices as society's ultimate artistic revenge on sexual predators and then some.Ellen Page gives the performance of a lifetime as a young woman named Hayley Stark, who for the most part remains a mystery throughout the film.  Luring Jeff (Patrick Wilson), an internet pervert who has a taste for photography and underage girls into a situation that seems ideal for a guy like this, the tables are turned are turned very quickly and predator becomes prey in a brutal fashion.  Hayley drops hints here and there of her absolute contempt for Jeff in the most subtle, teasing ways, but he has absolutely no way of knowing what's coming.Hayley has so many different motives that it gets hard to keep track of amidst all of Jeff's screaming: it seems that she wants to cause him the most grievous psychological and physical pain, remove his manhood and make him feel as docile and impotent as possible in the face of her considerable wrath, and also bring him face to with exactly what he is, allowing him no easy way out--not even death.  At least not immediately.  Her thoroughness and absolute ruthlessness lead one to wonder if Hayley herself is all that balanced.  At no point does she display any emotion but delight in his suffering and enthusiasm for finding new ways to cause it, which she does very well.  She mentions a model who disappeared named Donna Mauer, though when Jeff desperately probes the possibility of a friendship between the two she gives no definitive answer.  She may be anybody--a random sexual abuse victim who decided to go head hunting, indeed a friend of the young model he had a part in killing, or a psychopathic teenager looking for a legitimate moral cause as the the outlet for her rage.  In any case, one cannot sympathize with Jeff; Patrick Wilson portrays him realistically, as a con man who is hollow and perverse at the core.  At one point--while a perceived castration is taking place--Jeff relates a horrific from his childhood to Hayley.  Is it real, or something he made up to generate sympathy?  There's no way of telling.  At any rate, it does not phase Hayley one bit. The black humor here lies mostly in snippets of the dialogue, and you have to laugh loudly because otherwise you can't breathe.

Basically the entire movie is some pervy 34 year old guy named Jeff (Patrick Wilson), getting tortured by the rather boyish looking Ellen Page. They never reveal her age but I'm guessing she's anywhere from 18-23. In the movie she passes herself off as a 14 year old. But I don't think that is her character's actual age in the movie. Jeff likes the younger girls apparently and meets Ellen's character on an online chat room (of course). They decide to meet up at a local coffee shop and after much excruciatingly boring dialogue finally get in Jeff's car and drive to his pad.

With a total of 5 actors and only 2 with significant roles, the movie is set up more as a stage play than a film...It's almost like a rehashing of Roman Polanski's ""Death and the Maiden."" Ironically, there's a reference to Polanski in the film. Looking at the cover of the movie you see ""Two Thumbs Up"" and ""Riveting & Terrifying.""All these are fairly accurate descriptions, but I still think the subject matter could've been handled a lot better. Hayley (Ellen Page, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"") is a 14-year old girl who has spent two weeks chatting with a guy named Jeff (Patrick Wilson) over the internet. Jeff is thirty and from what we gather in the opening sequence, a little creepy. Hayley suggests they meet, Jeff agrees. They meet at a coffee shop, playfully flirt, and pretty soon Hayley is at Jeff's house drinking screwdrivers. Then, Jeff collapses and wakes up tied to a chair. Hayley, you see, is under the impression that Jeff is a pedophile (which he no doubt it) and also a murderer...Of her friend. The filmmakers present the characters; Hayley never elaborates just how close she was to this girl, but to go to the lengths she does...They must've been pretty close. The movie clocks out at about 100 minutes; 85 minutes focuses on Hayley torturing Jeff, both physically and mentally. Problem is...What she does is pretty predictable. During the ""torture"" scene, I knew what was really going on and her final speech to Jeff at the end of the film sounds like it was plagarized from every other film with a vaguely simalar subject matter (Who am I? I'm every girl you've...). The movie does have it's high points though. It does create suspense well, sometimes keeping you on the edge of your seat. Most people won't notice this, but the opening scenes are pretty brilliant. If you listen to the way the two characters are speaking with each other, it sounds as if each of them is choosing their words carefully as to not scare the other person off. The end of the film is built up too much for it to be any surprise, but when the film ended...I questioned something? In this film, Jeff is supposed to be the villain. While watching the movie though, I couldn't help noticing that it's Hayley who seems to be playing the evil character. We never see Jeff do anything violent, unless it's in self-defense. Hayley seems like an insane, sadistic little girl. If this film does nothing else, it should jumpstart the careers of the two leads. It takes a lot for two characters to carry a movie and the two do the best job they can with the script. It's a good movie, don't get me wrong. It's just really nothing special.GRADE: B-",4,"A Little Predictable, But Very Well Acted",1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,2757,"['Hard', 'Candy', 'interesting', 'premise', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'Instead', 'riveting', 'O.K', 'movie', 'total', '5', 'actors', 'only', '2', 'significant', 'roles', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'more', 'stage', 'play', 'film', 'almost', 'rehashing', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Death', 'Maiden', 'Ironically', 'reference', 'Polanski', 'film', 'Looking', 'cover', 'movie', 'see', 'Two', 'Thumbs', 'Up', 'Riveting', 'Terrifying', 'are', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'descriptions', 'still', 'think', 'subject', 'matter', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'handled', 'lot', 'better', 'Hayley', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', '14-year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'spent', 'two', 'weeks', 'chatting', 'guy', 'named', 'Jeff', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'internet', 'Jeff', 'thirty', 'what', 'gather', 'opening', 'sequence', 'little', 'creepy', 'Hayley', 'meet', 'Jeff', 'meet', 'coffee', 'shop', 'playfully', 'flirt', 'pretty', 'soon', 'Hayley', 'Jeff', 'house', 'drinking', 'screwdrivers', 'Then', 'Jeff', 'up', 'tied', 'chair', 'Hayley', 'see', 'impression', 'Jeff', 'pedophile', 'doubt', 'also', 'murderer', 'friend', 'filmmakers', 'present', 'characters', 'Hayley', 'never', 'just', 'how', 'close', 'was', 'girl', 'go', 'lengths', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pretty', 'close', 'movie', 'out', 'about', '100', 'minutes', '85', 'minutes', 'focuses', 'Hayley', 'torturing', 'Jeff', 'physically', 'mentally', 'Problem', 'What', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'torture', 'scene', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'final', 'speech', 'Jeff', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'plagarized', 'other', 'film', 'vaguely', 'simalar', 'subject', 'matter', 'Who', 'am', ""'m"", 'girl', ""'ve"", 'movie', 'have', 'high', 'points', 'create', 'suspense', 'well', 'sometimes', 'keeping', 'edge', 'seat', 'Most', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'opening', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'brilliant', 'listen', 'way', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'speaking', 'other', 'choosing', 'words', 'carefully', 'not', 'scare', 'other', 'person', 'end', 'film', 'built', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'surprise', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'questioned', 'something', 'film', 'Jeff', 'supposed', 'be', 'villain', 'watching', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'noticing', 'Hayley', 'who', 'be', 'playing', 'evil', 'character', 'never', 'see', 'Jeff', 'do', 'anything', 'violent', 'self-defense', 'Hayley', 'insane', 'sadistic', 'little', 'girl', 'film', 'nothing', 'else', 'should', 'jumpstart', 'careers', 'two', 'leads', 'lot', 'two', 'characters', 'carry', 'movie', 'two', 'do', 'best', 'job', 'can', 'script', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'just', 'really', 'nothing', 'special.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A

I think everything is perfect and it is now in a very short list of amazing films that is filled with all talk and never bores you. The film is about a 14-year-old girl named Hayley played by Ellen Page. The film goes right into the base of its story when Hayley meets up with a 32 year old man named Jeff whom she met in a chat room. Already you can tell that this girl is a little different from any 14 year old you know.She tries to show Jeff her intelligence right off the bat by using big words and telling him about stuff she learned from books that she reads. He just takes this as her being a teen who thinks she knows it all but you'll find out that she actually does. The entire time that they're chatting in the cafe Jeff doesn't realize that he is the victim and not Hayley. Hayley is sure that Jeff is a pedofile and was involved in a missing child's murder so she uses herself as bait to get inside his home and take over so she can find the evidence she needs.The acting is amazing even though the cast really only consist of two people. The first movie I saw Ellen in was X Men the last stand but the role was so small that I really didn't pay attention to her. Her performance in this is out of this world and she makes this movie what it is. The cinematography was on point, it showed a rugged picture when needed. It had to show the actors fear, frustration, and confusion. I would never think that a story like this could be pulled off but the right cast was picked and it was written and paced perfectly. It may actually remind you of ""Phone Booth"" or even ""SAW"" so if your the impatient type and don't like a suspense buildup then this movie might irk you.I have nothing negative to say about this film and how could you when this little girl is doing something that most people could never do. I am sad to see some reviews on Hard Candy from people that see it as a movie with no meaning at all. I understand that it's just a movie and a little farfetched because it's a 14 year old carrying out punishment and trying to bring justice to a girl that could've been herself. I think about parent's who's children have been missing for years and they still don't know where their kids are and how they might wish for a person that would do this. I know it's a fictional story but it still has a moral to it that should stick with everyone. To be honest I'm not even sure if Haley is really 14 in the movie or just looks like one and uses it.

Intelligent (might I even say--""thought provoking"") drama gets me off.  Two of my favorite classics are ""The Lion in Winter"" and ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff?""--two powerful, but wickedly funny, verbal bloodbaths based on plays.  Now I'm not saying ""Hard Candy"" falls into that league, but it is certainly refreshing to watch an adult film with an actual point-of-view that doesn't dumb itself down for mass consumption.Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson are both suberb, and there are enough twists and action to keep the viewer guessing through their game of cat-and-mouse.  This is a sweet antidote to the usual summer blockbuster--one that will make you think and one that you will remember.Not to provide a spoiler, but the film does wrap itself up rather tidily--which keeps it from being truly brilliant (I'd actually give it 4 1/2 stars).

The beginning starts off with Ellen Page, a 14 year old tomboy wise beyond her years meeting a 32 year old man for coffee and going back to his house with him. You know that nothing good can come of this and nothing does, but not in the way you expect. Few films can build psychological tension the way this one does, the bantering between the two leads, Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page is disturbing because it is so realistic. You imagine that this his how predators pick up on young girls, playing to their interests and vulnerabilities.After the tables are turned and the predator finds himself a victim the movie becomes truly disturbing, not because you sympathize with Wilson's character, he's a charming, amoral scumbag, but because of the intensity of Page's character. You can't help but wonder what she's been through and what has driven her to behave in such an extreme fashion and the revenge she serves up is not at all satisfying. The expression on her face in the last scene will stay with you long after the movie ends.The last film I saw that had me on the edge of my seat like this one did was ""Death and the Maiden"".

645553,A1H89KJ9KF1SB9,B00005JP3W,"Kody Boye ""Horror Author""","[0, 1]","Only in your heart do you believe everything that is true is real.For others, they don't believe a single thing you know.You know why?Because THEY know.In a world where technology and the internet seem to be able to hide everything we do, people think they can cover their traps by destroying their hard drive or burning their film. To a degree, it can be true--a hard drive full of pictures explodes and it's highly unlikely you'll ever get back; burn the film and it's gone forever, dust particles in the air as the last remnants of a dirty secret slowly turns to nothing.In HARD CANDY, we learn one man's deadly secret... and one girl's desire to uproot it.Hailey Stark is your average fourteen-your-old girl. She's cute, innocent, smart, and as charming as she can be. But when she meets thirty-year-old photographer Jeff Kohlver over the internet, she's got more planned than just a 'simple meeting.' After Jeff takes her to his home for an impromptu photoshoot, things steadily start to turn around as Jeff starts slurring his words. As Hailey continuously begs Jeff to 'shoot her,' his world slowly begins to blur...... and thus, the game is turned upside down.HARD CANDY is a movie unlike any I have seen in recent history. This psychological thriller could be compared to the grotesque, often-suspenseful SAW franchise, as well as several others in recent history. What's different about HARD CANDY, you ask?For starts, it deals with a heavy subject--child pornography, a taboo subject you can rarely begin to whisper about without causing some kind of uproar. We've all heard and seen what it's all about, men and women who find themselves carnally attracted to innocent, often prepubescent children. But what do we NOT know about them? Their schemes, their lies, their 'she asked for it' excuses--they're all a ploy on their behalf, an excuse to get out of something they believe they didn't do wrong.In the end, everyone knows what's wrong.So does Hailey.As the movie slowly begins to drag on, we begin to learn that Hailey knows a lot more than is expected. For one, she knows about Donna, the girl who's missing; and for two, she knows about Janelle, the girl Jeff obsesses over to the point of keeping letters, pictures, and even more incriminating evidence. What's originally thought of as a 'casual, albeit disturbing' meeting quickly turns into a torture session involving one little girl and the man she knows who did something wrong.HARD CANDY is definitely an entertaining movie--I'll say that before I even begin to cut into the pros and cons of the film. It's suspenseful, psychological, entertaining; it's all these things and more, yet the true impact behind the movie is what's buried within the roots. While the film broadcasts itself as a 'psychological thriller,' I see HARD CANDY as a thinking person's movie, as well as a film with an amazing cast.PROS:-- The main actors. Both Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson do an amazing job feeding off one another from the moment the film begins to the moment it ends. As someone who has only seen Page in one previous movie, I was surprised how easily (and how successfully) she could transition from being a cute, innocent girl to something more than that. Wilson plays a perfect terrified victim. I think the best part about the movie is the cast. Although small (limited to only five characters,) each and every actor pulled their rolls off greatly.-- The suspense. There wasn't a moment where I WASN'T on the edge of my seat during this movie.-- The dialogue and interaction. As I mentioned with the main actors, the way Page and Wilson work off one another is amazing to watch. An innocent victim, a psychological nutcase--this is how I'd see a scenario like this playing out.Sadly, though, there are a few things I picked up on when watching HARD CANDY.CONS:-- The castration scene. It didn't necessarily bother me in the sense that I felt it was unnecessary (because in a plot and story like this is, it was completely necessary,) but in the sense of how it was executed. When Hailey begins the castration process, we notice Jeff is in pain, but not expressing his pain in a way the viewer would expect. Up until that point, he was screaming over mundane (if still extreme) details, but when he's being castrated, he simply lays there, grits his teeth, and sweats. I can contribute this to shock, but it surprised me to hear that Jeff wasn't screaming even a little bit.-- The 'clean up.' There were several points during the movie when Hailey is cleaning herself up that she completely ignores the obvious things that could get her caught (mainly the point in which she walks through the house soaking-wet.) I can only assume that she had wet shoes after she dragged Jeff into the shower. Maybe it's just me (or maybe it helps contribute to Hailey's selfless want to destroy someone she hates,) but regardless, it's one part of Hailey's character that can be questioned to the point of redundancy.Despite its extremely-minor flaws, HARD CANDY is an amazing movie. Wilson and Page are superb, the story (though slightly underdeveloped) is captivating, and the suspense keeps you on the end of your seat until the movie's finally over. A definite watch for any horror/suspense fan.",4,"Paint a picture, take a portrait (contains spoilers)",1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,5255,"['Only', 'heart', 'do', 'believe', 'everything', 'true',

I'm telling you right now, this so-called film can startle my dreams into HELL, litterally! I thought the story plot from this one would be harmless, boy, was I wrong. This was going way too far. Listen everybody, there's a positive way to handle a Blood-Curdling crisis and there's a negative way. Why does this movie have to hit very close to home anyway? I was very ashamed after this was over. It was very immoral,shocking,disturbing,anti-social,twisted,one-sided,out of line and very hard to swallow.(i'm not laughing.) Once Ellen Page's character was in the guy's house, she knew what she was doing. Because I kept telling myself that she had something up her sleeve, and I was right. That man was in for a Rude Awakening. The tables were turned, she was completely out of her rotten mind and she tried to find evidence against him. All she found, was one picture, one measley picture of an underage girl. This sets her character off, causing her to do the unthinkable to a man, who says he's innocent. This so-called film caused me to feel sorry for the guy. He's being tortured, accused, electricuted, humiliated, operated on and worst of all, horrified. He was the victem in all of this. The accuser was a rotten-minded teenage girl with a motive to bring a pedophile down to justice. I mean, for pete's sake she got away with stuff nobody should get away with. I couldn't put anything together to figure this film out. In reality, there are teens out there in the world who would NOT react the way Ellen's character did.

645558,A1OE5SI8PQDZK4,B00005JP3W,L.C.,"[8, 13]","I guess this movie is trying to make a statement or make you think.  About what???  That the makers of this movie should seriously reconsider their career path?  I was 14 once, and so were all my friends.  I have teenage nieces.  By physical appearance only, Hayley might pass for 14 at first glance, but once she opens her mouth, forget it!  14-year-old girls don't look like this.  They don't dress like this.  They don't talk like this, and they don't act like this.  She's, at times, both too pre-pubescent and too artificially conceived to actually be as clever as we're supposed to think she is.  14-year-old girls don't come up with the perfect crime, and they certainly can't pull off stunts like these.  Hayley doesn't even have the muscle mass to pull off the plan.  I'm 110 lbs.  My husband's 185 lbs.  If he were a completely, unconscious dead weight, I couldn't get him into the positions Hayley achieves with Geoff in this movie, and he's gotta be twice her size or more.  If the director or the writer is trying to portray Hayley as a vigilante worth rooting for, they completely failed.  She seemed like a sick, twisted, vile individual in serious need of psychotherapy, who purposely lured a pedophile, so she could ""justifiably"" torture a man.  Hey, what happened here?  Sick, twisted, vile individual in serious need of psychotherapy -- wasn't I supposed to be saying that about Geoff?  While it's clear that Geoff has an unnatural interest in young girls, it's not clear until the end whether or not he's ever crossed the line before meeting Hayley.  By then, it doesn't really matter, because you've already spent most of the movie wanting him to break free and choke her out for being a tiresome sadist.  Had Geoff been a true predator, Hayley wouldn't have had a prayer's chance from the moment that she stepped foot in his car.  Hayley's like listening to someone run their fingernails down a chalk board for 103 minutes.  103 minutes of that, and you'd wanna beat her down, too!  Come on!  Geoff is either intelligent & charming, or a driveling idiot depending on what the misbegotten script calls for.  We're expected to believe that he can neither outwit this child, nor can he overcome her with brute force, AND that he will succumb to her demented, little plan.  I can't suspend my disbelief that far.  2 stars, because I didn't exactly hate it outright -- the premise was, at least, interesting.  Rent this only if, like a cat, your curiosity must be satisfied, but be prepared to be disappointed & disgusted with the unrealism, much like your cat when he discovers that the vibrations in the bag are battery-operated.  ""The Salton Sea"" is a much more satisfying (and more believable) tale of vigilante justice, and flat out more entertaining than ""Hard Candy.""

645561,A3ORIPRRULK20G,B00005JP3W,"Leonard Skinnard ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown""","[2, 5]","I never heard of this film until two days ago when I looked at the new DVD releases for this week. After reading the reviews on this site and at [...] I headed to the video store, they had five copies but only one in stock. I asked the clerk if she had any feedback, she said yes, she saw it last night and was the best film she watched this year. Needless to say, I rented that copy and watched it last night.Since the other reviews deal with the storyline, here's my general impression. It's a gritty film with superb acting, probably just a notch below films like ""Taxi Driver"" or ""In Cold Blood"". It will keep your attention for the entire 105 minutes even though the film is mostly dialogue and is filmed indoors at one location. The female lead is a 14 year old who I believe was 15 in real life, she gives a performance that if the world was fair, she would win best actress.For young filmakers the bonus features are really nice since they deal completely with movie making and are about an hour long. The producer talks about how the basic story idea came about, finding a screenwriter and working out a first draft. Next came securing the right director and holding auditions, especially for the young actress. The film was shot in 18 days for under a million dollars and was finished about July 2004. They secured a prime screening slot at Sundance, a midnight showing. However, they were late starting because the Dolby Sound went out and then people outside waiting in line realized there was too many people for the number of seats. The Sundance people became perturbed, but eventually everything was fixed and viewing went off. However, as soon as the film ended all of the studio people immediately left the theater, they soon learned it was because they all wanted to call their studios for permission to sign the film.Within two days of the Sundance showing they had sold the international rights and later after pitching the film to ten American studios, six wanted the film. The studio had to agree not to change a single frame of the film, which was the case. However, once it was in the hands of a studio they were concerned about the trailer, which is included, and if they would giveaway too much of the storyline. They were completely happy with the trailer.The director also talked about the film's technical aspects, digital coloring, the work of the focus puller, and the music score, background colors, etc. How music in a drama is used mostly to heighten a situation or to hide something, and in this film there is only nine minutes of music including the opening and closing credits. They wanted the dialogue to be uncluttered so they used a lot of ambient sound instead of music. Also, they shyed away from pulling in on the actor's face to add drama, but instead they used lighting to highlight the intensity. They chose to darken the actor's face but without darkening the background, however to accomplish this required a lot of trial and error. Many of the techniques used actually went unnoticed by me and it wasn't until seeing the bonus features and the director bringing them to my attention did I realize what they had done.The film opened in the U.S. fifteen months after Sundance, April 14, 2006 premiering in New York and Los Angeles on 50 screens. It did better than any other limited release for that number of screens. This explains why I never heard of it, I don't believe it even played in the Baltimore area. Anyway, the DVD is now available and it's a film any serious movie goer should see, I also highly recommend the film for parents of teenage daughters, but it should be a must for their daughters to see as well.",5,New Addition to my Top 100 Films,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,3669,"['never', 'heard', 'film', 'two', 'days', 'when', 'looked', 'new', 'DVD', 'week', 'reading', 'reviews', 'site', '[', ']', 'headed', 'video', 'store', 'had', 'five', 'copies', 'only', 'one', 'stock', 'asked', 'clerk', 'had', 'feedback', 'said', 'yes', 'saw', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'best', 'film', 'watched', 'year', 'Needless', 'say', 'rented', 'copy', 'watched', 'last', 'other', 'reviews', 'deal', 'storyline', 'here', 'general', 'impression', 'gritty', 'film', 'superb', 'acting', 'probably', 'just', 'notch', 'films', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'will', 'keep', 'attention', 'entire', '105', 'minutes', 'even', 'film', 'mostly', 'dialogue', 'filmed', 'indoors', 'one', 'location', 'female', 'lead', '14', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'believe', 'was', '15', 'real', 'life', 'performance', 'world', 'was', 'fair', 'would', 'win', 'best', 'actress.For', 'young', 'filmakers', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'really', 'nice', 'deal', 'completely', 'movie', 'making', 'are', 'hour', 'long', 'producer', 'talks', 'how', 'basic', 'story', 'idea', 'came', 'about', 'finding', 'screenwriter', 'working', 'out', 'first', 'draft', 'Next', 'came', 'securing', 'right', 'director', 'holding', 'auditions', 'especially', 'young', 'actress', 'film', 'was', 'shot', '18', 'days', 'million', 'dollars', 'was', 'finished', 'July', '2004', 'secured', 'prime', 'screening', 'slot', 'Sundance', 'midnight', 'showing', 'However', 'were', 'late', 'starting', 'Dolby', 'Sound', 'went', 'out', 'then', 'people', 'waiting', 'line', 'realized', 'was', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'number', 'seats', 'Sundance', 'people', 'became', 'perturbed', 'eventually', 'everything', 'was', 'fixed', 'viewing', 'went', 'off', 'However', 'as', 'soon', 'film', 'ended', 'studio', 'people', 'immediately', 'left', 'theater', 'soon', 'learned', 'was', 'wanted', 'call', 'studios', 'permission', 'sign', 'film.Within', 'two', 'days', 'Sundance', 'showing', 'had', 'sold', 'international', 'rights', 'later', 'pitching', 'film', 'ten', 'American', 'studios', 'six', 'wanted', 'film', 'studio', 'had', 'agree', 'not', 'change', 'single', 'frame', 'film', 'was', 'case', 'However', 'was', 'hands', 'studio', 'were', 'concerned', 'trailer', 'included', 'would', 'giveaway', 'too', 'much', 'storyline', 'were', 'completely', 'happy', 'trailer.The', 'director', 'also', 'talked', 'film', 'technical', 'aspects', 'digital', 'coloring', 'work', 'focus', 'puller', 'music', 'score', 'background', 'colors', 'etc', 'How', 'music', 'drama', 'used', 'mostly', 'heighten', 'situation', 'hide', 'something', 'film', 'only', 'nine', 'minutes', 'music', 'including', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'wanted', 'dialogue', 'be', 'uncluttered', 'used', 'lot', 'ambient', 'sound', 'instead', 'music', 'Also', 'shyed', 'away', 'pulling', 'actor', 'face', 'add', 'drama', 'instead', 'used', 'lighting', 'highlight', 'intensity', 'chose', 'darken', 'actor', 'face', 'darkening', 'background', 'however', 'accomplish', 'required', 'lot', 'trial', 'error', 'Many', 'techniques', 'used', 'actually', 'went', 'unnoticed', 'was', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'bonus', 'features', 'director', 'bringing', 'attention', 'did', 'realize', 'what', 'had', 'done.The', 'film', 'opened', 'U.S.', 'fifteen', 'months', 'Sundance', 'April', '14', '2006', 'premiering', 'New', 'York', 'Los', 'Angeles', '50', 'screens', 'did', 'better', 'other', 'limited', 'release', 'number', 'screens', 'why', 'never', 'heard', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'even', 'played', 'Baltimore', 'area', 'Anyway', 'DVD', 'now', 'available', 'film', 'serious', 'movie', 'goer', 'should', 'see', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'parents', 'teenage', 'daughters', 'should', 'be', 'must', 'daughters', 'see', 'as', 'well']",N/A

The terrible intolerable need to continue watching absorbs and terrifies while you seem disturbed by a need to find a side to root for. The pedophile photographer who may have committed a homicide or the teenager who seems bent on revenge with such hatred you feel for her psychological statae of mind and her emotional integrity while admiring the psychological battle of wits that throws every trick in the book and seemingly confiscates the essence of every psychotic malady the rational rituals of desire have equipped human nature with. Ellen Page is too good to be true and so belligerent in her sympathetic role that you can't stand her.

She is placed aface Patrick Wilson who performs the role of a pedophile with impenetrable guile and belated predatory pride. He runs the gamut of psycho games and betrays psychobabble while his counterpart frustrates his strategic acumen by outsmarting him to such an extent you wonder as he does: Who is this girl? It gets terrifyiing and tense in a swell of emotional callousness that dumbs the pity elusively ambling in a dialogue that is always disquieted by minds that forage a loot in every chance digression. It is shot with bestirring incision and lavish in its climactic rush. I do not think a movie could be shot with more intensity.

Poker face after poker face we experience the insistence of insanity at its most gripping hold, but not the newspaper brand, here we have a mixture of hatred and desire controlled and fashioned by a shooting that ends with the incredible after the impossibly disgusting has been shaved a few times.

645568,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00005JP3W,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[36, 57]","I'm going to make this review as straight-forward as possible.  It might be asking to much to hope that most people will judge it based on its content, and not on whether or not they agree with the ratings I've chosen.  It's probably safe to assume that a large number of readers will already know what they think of these films, in which case I'd suggest you read this review to get another's opinion.  If you haven't seen either of these films, however, I guarantee you that you'll have a good idea of which of these movies you'll be most likely to enjoy.This review will concern two movies -- THE WOODSMAN andHard Candy-- both of which focus exclusively on the very thorny, very divisive topic of child molestation/pedophilia.Before I get into the films themselves, I'd like to make one thing crystal clear: there is nothing funny about child molestation.  It is a horrible crime, and there are no scenarios in which it is acceptable in any way, shape, or form.  As a survivor of child molestation, I have a first-hand understanding of the kinds of repercussions caused by this incredibly heinous act.  And please don't misunderstand.  I do NOT say this to garner pity or sympathy, nor do I seek to represent myself as the voice of all molestation victims everywhere.  Hardly.  It has taken me a long time to get to the point where I can say this with simple acknowledgement, as a way of framing my opinions with a basic and necessary fact that has colored my experiences with love, sex, romance, and relationships my entire life.My opinion, in a nutshell:  THE WOODSMAN is a good film, because it manages to get the audience to sympathize with the pedophile.  HARD CANDY is a horrible film for the exact same reason.  How can this be?  It's because the first film is about forgiveness and redemption, and the second film is about unadulterated hate and vengeance.  Speaking as someone who use to embrace hate, I can tell you that HARD CANDY's philosophies -- popular and easily digestible though they may be -- are counterproductive and destructive.  Older and wiser now, THE WOODSMAN's philosophies may be much harder to stomach, but they are the way the world is, or rather, should be.HARD CANDY is a disgusting film.  The talentedEllen Pageplays Hayley Stark, a girl who is being pursued by Jeff, our resident pedophile.  After Jeff conives to get Hayley back to his house, it becomes clear that Hayley is not your typical 14-year-old.  From this point on, Hayley tortures Jeff relentlessly while they engage in repetitive and predictable dialogue about his crimes.  Hayley appears to have the wits of a Harvard grad and the strength and agility of a quarterback, because she ensares and releases and ensares Jeff in a series of elaborate torments without breaking a sweat.  This movie is very, very much a revenge fantasy, and that is all it is.When I was young, and lying in bed, I used to imagine similar fantasies, and all they did was prolong my own recovery process.  I've heard dozens of different explanations for the film's premise and goals, but the end game is this: this movie is obviously about turning the tables.  Unfortunately, when you turn the tables, what you get is a young girl who behaves with the confident viciousness of a child molester, and a child molester who flails about, as confused, hurt, and distraught as a child.  Jeff is a horrible person, which is why I was so disturbed to find myself kind of wishing he would win out over the insufferably pompous and stone-hearted Hayley.  This movie contains no subtlety, no surprises, and nothing beyond its surface level viciousness.THE WOODSMAN, on the other hand, shows the consequences of such viciousness.  Kevin Bacon plays Walter, a convicted child molester who is desperately trying to be a normal person.  Unlike HARD CANDY's endless rants, this film has very little dialogue, but world's more heart and wisdom.  Walter is a damaged man, but he knows he's damaged, and the movie explores the possibility that people can change, can finally deserve forgiveness.  There are a few very difficult scenes in THE WOODSMAN -- scenes I found myself gritting my teeth at -- but they provided very clear answers.  How can anyone change if they cannot forgive themselves?  And how can anyone forgive themselves if the world refuses to forgive them, too?As someone who struggled with forgiveness, trust me, I understand the desire to label such people with easy monikers like ""monster"" or ""sicko,"" but I also know that those kinds of labels are just another way of avoiding the agonizing calculus of penance divided by resentment.  Actually, one of the labels I used -- sicko -- is fairly apt, because this film shows how Walter is less a villain who uses his urges to destroy than he is another human being who is destroyed by something he longs to be rid of.  In spite of the film's probative pace, it's quiet stance, the movie feels remarkably short (when it was done, it felt like thirty minutes had passed, instead of ninety), and although I felt like it could have gone into a bit more depth with some of its questions, it did do exactly what it set out to do, no more and no less.I give HARD CANDY one star, THE WOODSMAN four.  If you're wondering which one you might enjoy, ask yourself the following question: which philosophy do you most agree with...""An eye for an eye..."" (HARD CANDY)""...makes the whole world blind.""

645569,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B00005JP3W,Mark,"[5, 9]","First of all, I want to say that it is completely ignorant of Pete Hammond to call this film ""Fatal Attraction for a new age.""  Sure, ""Fatal Attraction"" was a good film that asks many questions.  However, nothing, in any form, can compare to what this film does.  Secondly, for those of you giving this film a bad review, you knew, by reading the back of the box, that this would be about pedophilia, and the extreme measures of one girl trying to teach him a lesson.  You can't discredit the film for that reason.  Many reviewers, including Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper, have highly reccomended this film, but they have also added a warning that this film would be extremely uncomfortable.  And boy, is it.The beginning of this film is not too out of the ordinary of the context of the plot.  Jeff (Patrick Wilson) is a thirtysomething fashion photographer, with a thing for younger girls.  Much younger.  He talks to Hayley (Ellen Page, in an extremely Oscar-worthy role) in an online chat room, and she agrees to meet him at a local coffee shot.  After discussing various things, Jeff tells Hayley of his profession, and she agrees to go to his house and let him photograph her.  In the beginning, we feel nothing but disgust for Jeff, as we should, but later in the film, we get caught in a limbo.  More on that in a second.  Jeff and Hayley arrive at his (Jeff's) house, and Jeff offers Hayley a drink.  More disgust.  Hayley tells Jeff that she learned in school that a person shouldn't take any drink they haven't mixed themselves.  Hayley proceeds to mix drinks, and Jeff should have taken a lesson.  After more small talk, Hayley turns on the music, and starts getting rowdy on Jeff's couch.  By this time, Jeff is feeling a bit under the weather, and soon passes out.  When he wakes up, he finds himself tied to a chair.  He first dismisses it as a ""sex game"" but soon realizes that Hayley means business.  For most of the film, we feel the base feeling of contempt and disgust for Jeff.  But what follows, at least from a male perspective, draws sympathy towards Jeff.  I don't want to say that I feel bad for what happens next, but...yes, I do.  I did feel bad for Jeff.  Before you call me a pedophile, let me explain.  Nothing on the face of the Earth could have prepared me for what was about to happen.  Jeff get's knocked out again, and the next time he wakes up, it's like we've been drawn into ""Saw"" (except so much better).  He wakes up on a cold table, pants down around his ankles, and an icebag on his privates.  Hayley comes in with shaving cream and a razor.  Jeff asks what it's for.  Hayley tells Jeff that she needs to shave him if she's going to castrate him.  Are you serious?  She is, and, as if to give Jeff some relief, she tells him that she has a medical book to help her.  Whew, that would take a load off of my chest.  What follows is one of the most dramatically intense scenes that I have ever encountered in a film.  I can't even begin to describe it.  If I told you anything else, I would be giving it away, but just know this.  The climax of this film is one of the most suspensful climaxes I have ever seen.In reading Roger Ebert's review of this film, he posed a question that never even crossed my mind.  ""Still, what precisely is going on here, and is it anywhere near as clear as it seems?  Is [Hayley] perhaps getting some pleasure of her own out of the situation she has created for Jeff?  Are there two perverts in the room?""  Brilliantly said, and I think there is a sound argument behind it.  I think I'll leave that question unanswered.  I like to leave things open-ended.  The fact is, this film is brilliant.  It's suspensful, terrifying, and knows how to push taboos.  The performances are brilliant, especially Page's, and this is one of my favorite (with a warning) films of the year.

I don't know what it was that drew me so strongly to it, but there was something about it that just wet my appetite for great cinema.So, the week came when it was to be released, and Friday rolled around.  I went to see it - and left utterly disappointed.  I don't know what I expected from the film, from all the press I read I expected simple torture then an end to the film, but what I got, I later realized, was so much more.The story, although topical to some degree, is at first glance a story of one person wanting to teach another a lesson about the ""naughty"" things they do, ALA Seven and Saw.  But as the film unfolds the true faces are shown, and they're ugly.  Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson turn in flawless performances, as they're the only main actors in the film, Sandra Oh plays a small, yet somewhat vital role, and then there's that one guy at the cafe.The reason I detested this movie was for one simple reason - manipulation.  NEVER in my life have I seen a film where my beliefs and feelings concerning the characters has shifted so furiously between one and the other.  You sincerely believe that Jeff is an innocent man and that Haley is simply a sociopath.  As the story unfolds, if you see the film in the same light as I did, by the end you'll be completely worn out, and left with a feeling of bleakness.With most recent horror films focusing mainly on the gore aspect, and very little story, albeit one as complex as this, it was incredibly refreshing to see a horror/suspense film that was something that could just possibly top Hitchcock in his finest hour.A true masterpiece.",5,"I hated it, the best film of 2006",1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,1714,"['safe', 'say', 'release', 'film', 'was', 'basically', 'foaming', 'mouth', 'anticipation', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'drew', 'so', 'strongly', 'was', 'something', 'just', 'wet', 'appetite', 'great', 'cinema.So', 'week', 'came', 'when', 'was', 'be', 'released', 'Friday', 'rolled', 'around', 'went', 'see', 'left', 'utterly', 'disappointed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expected', 'film', 'press', 'read', 'expected', 'simple', 'torture', 'then', 'end', 'film', 'what', 'got', 'later', 'realized', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more.The', 'story', 'topical', 'degree', 'first', 'glance', 'story', 'one', 'person', 'wanting', 'teach', 'lesson', 'naughty', 'things', 'do', 'ALA', 'Seven', 'Saw', 'film', 'true', 'are', 'shown', ""'re"", 'ugly', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'turn', 'flawless', 'performances', ""'re"", 'only', 'main', 'actors', 'film', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'small', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'vital', 'role', 'then', 'one', 'guy', 'cafe.The', 'reason', 'detested', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'simple', 'reason', 'manipulation', 'NEVER', 'life', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'where', 'beliefs', 'feelings', 'concerning', 'characters', 'shifted', 'so', 'furiously', 'one', 'other', 'sincerely', 'believe', 'Jeff', 'innocent', 'man', 'Haley', 'simply', 'sociopath', 'story', 'unfolds', 'see', 'film', 'same', 'light', 'did', 'end', ""'ll"", 'be', 'completely', 'worn', 'out', 'left', 'feeling', 'bleakness.With', 'most', 'recent', 'horror', 'films', 'focusing', 'mainly', 'gore', 'aspect', 'very', 'little', 'story', 'albeit', 'one', 'as', 'complex', 'was', 'incredibly', 'refreshing', 'see', 'horror/suspense', 'film', 'was', 'something', 'could', 'just', 'possibly', 'top', 'Hitchcock', 'finest', 'hour.A', 'true', 'masterpiece']",N/A

In this one a thirty-something man is trolling the Internet chat rooms looking for young girls.  He has a conversation with a 14 year old girl and they agree to meet.He tells the girl that he is a photographer that does a lot of work for magazines and the girl ends up at his house.  The first thing that the girl notices is there are photos of young girls lining the walls.  He gives her alcohol and she appears to be getting drunk but then the man starts getting ill and passes out.  When he wakes up he is tied to a chair and being interrogated by the girl.  She tries to get him to say something incriminating or help her to locate something incriminating in his house.  As soon as she finds something you know that something bad will happen.

It's definitely outside of the ordinary situation you'd find in movies and I thought it was very entertaining (and creepy!) - instead, I'll focus on the Blu-Ray itself.Right off the bat, one change from the DVD is the coverart. It's got a 3-way split-view of the 2 actors and the title.. a big change from the original DVD art which was awesome. Nobody seems to enjoy it (and there are some 1-star reviews here about that specifically). But really, who cares? Not as good as the previous art, but not a big deal at all.. you're buying this for the movie. I'm more upset with the ""Eco-Case"" lionsgate used (with holes cut into the case to ""save plastic""? Again though, nothing that would affect the score).Onto the disc..VIDEO: I was very surprised with how nice it looked! I was expecting a mediocre transfer on this somewhat ""budget"" catalog-release.. but Lionsgate did a great job in transferring it. Video is sharp throughout, has great (and accurate) colors, and a layer of grain (nothing distracting though). Very well done, definitely one of the better catalog releases I've seen.. and it's right up there with recent releases.AUDIO: Again, no let-down here! DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio.. if you have a receiver that takes advantage of it, it'll sound fantastic. Again, in the top of the category (although it's nothing too demanding like a non-stop action movie).EXTRAS: Comparing it to my original DVD release, all the extras are here. It's got a few featurettes, some commentaries and making-of documentaties (one almost an hour long!). Unfortunately all are in SD, but I'm sure thats the best resolution available as they were made with DVD in mind years ago. Extras aren't anything outstanding, but a decent set.. especially when a lot of catalog titles have been coming out with NO extras from their previous releases.Overall, highly recommended.

HARD CANDY goes deeper than most into many of these themes, but sadly falls far short of greatness. There's no way I can say anything much about it without significant SPOILERS, so be warned.Precocious teen Hayley (Ellen Page, quite brilliant) meets much older photographer Jeff (the always excellent Patrick Wilson) in an internet chatroom, and then for real at a coffee shop. It's ""meet-cute"" with lots of saucy, seductive banter -- mostly on the part of Ellen -- and though it's engagingly filmed (lots of close-ups and interesting cutting in the early scenes, in brightly lit widescreen) it unsettled me, not because of the ickiness factor but because I didn't buy it. I didn't buy for a second that Ellen was going to be a victim, which was fine -- she obviously knows what she's doing, that's believable -- but that led me not to buy that Jeff - who seems just as smart as Ellen, and much more in control of himself than he apparently really is - would go along with it. Is he so wrapped up in his good fortune that he doesn't see her playing him? Perhaps, but the film strives for a lot of realism throughout and this was the first element that didn't work.When they leave the cafe and head to Jeff's somewhat remote hilltop suburban ranch home, the troubles really begin, both for Jeff who is soon to get more than he could possibly have bargained for, and the viewer, who is treated to a higher level of sadism and a more excruciating, drawn out series of psychological tortures than necessary or perhaps possible.  I wonder if the filmmakers were aiming at this point more for the horror film audience than for the serious art-film audience; indeed the whole film seems to be stuck between these two basic kinds of spectators - or notions of spectatorship.The most serious problem for me, ultimately, is that the film once having demonstrated that Ellen is at least a borderline psychopath herself then lets her off the hook by demonizing Jeff in an entirely unambiguous and exploitational way. The end result is that we are supposed to cheer on Ellen as she completes her horrifying but seemingly righteous plan; some will buy that and love it. I didn't, and the terrific performances and interesting film-making choices did not redeem it.  All in all, I'm left with very mixed feelings: on the one hand, there's an intellectual and moral cop-out in the way the characters are handled in the third act; on the other, the visceral outrage and sickening feelings do come through.

The film itself is somewhat like a Tootsie Roll pop--in that it has an annoying layer on the outside that prevents you from getting to the core. The problem Hard Candy is that it takes too many ""licks"" to get to the center!What I found about this ""candy"" was that the first 40 minutes of the film aren't ""hard"" at all. Leave it to [...] to make things interesting. Bodily mutilation can sometimes do that, I suppose.There are few things in today's world that frighten a parent more than pedophiles or the abduction of their child, and Hard Candy tries to capitalize on these fears. There are just too many problems with the film to make it a chilling and memorable one. For example, the young girl is far too cunning and crafty for her age. Its simply unbelievable that she could could pull of most of the things that she does.One very good thing about Hard Candy was that the viewer is never quite sure if the man is rightfully accused; the young girl becomes the villain.The major underlying theme of Hard Candy however, seems to be about vengeance, which only satisfies to a certain degree.

645589,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,B00005JP3W,"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883""","[12, 15]","Hard Candy is a film that outside of a few unscenic outdoor shots, was filmed entirely within the safe confines of a studio set. The reason for this was a financial one, producer David W. Higgens, actually sculpted Hard Candy in such a way as to have as few locations and actors as humanly possible, the only thing he needed was a worthy idea that could work around his budgetary plan, luckily he use to work for a primetime entertainment TV news show which afforded him access to many interesting true stories from around the globe. The report that spawned Hard Candy was out of Japan, apparently, ruffians would pose as underaged kids on the internet to lure pedophile businessmen to private locations with the promise of a one on one sexual encounter only to show up as a group of thugs and mug the would be molester, this is how Hard Candy became the story of a 14 year old girl who captures and torments a 32 year old internet preditor within a single isolated location.Often times the marraige of an air tight budget with that of a thriller produces a horrifying work of gritty realism that is next to unattainable within the Hollywood system. For such a marraige to work, it is absolutely crucial that the believability of the movie is not compromised by the script, film job, or acting, one only needs to think about Toby Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or John McNaughton's Henry Portrait of a serial killer to see how a small budget can actually be of benefit to the outcome of the picture. Hard Candy has a great concept, and outstanding acting by its principle leads, Patrick Wilson, and Ellen Page, all Hard Candy needed to reach the status of cult classic was a script and film job that does not hurt the believability of the story.The big quesiton of believability.Lets say for the sake of arguement, that you were drugged by a potential sex partner inside your own home, then over the course or the most tromatic day you could of ever imagined, you manage to escape five times, get knocked out four times, get tied up in various compromising possitions three times, including being precariously bound up on your tip toes, ballanced on a stool with your neck in a noose, you get asphyxiated by a plastic bag, sprayed in your mouth with cleansers, zapped around 50 times with a tazer gun, the whole time your house and most intimate possessions are being ransacked, your credibility destroyed, and unimaginable indignities are being perpetrated against you by a mastermind sadist, such as the numbing your spread eagle exposed private parts with a bag of ice to prep you for a make shift castration operation which this sadist fools you into believing actually took place. ( this sequence makes the whole film worth while, and is smartly milked to an agonizing half hour in lenth.) Now lets say that on your final escape that you manage to corner this monster on your roof only to have them pull a gun on you when you are only an arms away, they then offer you a crazy proposition. They tell you that if you willingly hang yourself from the noose they have provided and hung from your chimney that they will destroy all the incriminating evidence that could tarnish your reputation after your death.Would you...............A)attack this sadist with a berserkers rage that would rival Al Pacino at the end of Scarface dispite the chances of getting shot?or would you say to them.............B)"" You are so right about me, thank you so much for opening my eyes to what I truly am, and you're right again, I must die by my own volition....um excuse me while I get this noose over my head...ahhh, here we are... Well, thank you so much for showing me the truth, and also for saving my post mortem reputation, afterall, I know I can trust you after what you did to me today. Well hey, love to stay and chat, but um its time I say bye bye and jump off this roof and hang myself...Uhh thanks again."" TWANG!!! ""UGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!""and there is allways..............C) Instead of chasing them, gather up your porn and other shameful items flea your home in your car and dial 911.Needless to say, the writer that was hired, Brian Nelson, chose B.Truth is daring, because having guts is to avoid justification for psychotic actions.There is more then one single level to pedophilia, some people who are turned on by kids are still able to restrain themselves and not take liberties on innocent children. The character of Jeff does not have any self control over these dark desires, if anything, he embraces his perversion by using his finances, time, and energy, to premeditate, pursue, lure, and molest young budding girls, in fact, his entire life is dedicated to this sick quest. 14 year old Haley is possibly more dangerous then Jeff, she is a highly intelligent sociopathic sadist, with a bent sence of vigilante justice. Like Jeff, she also premeditates, pursues, and lures her victoms, but she does not stop there, for she also drugs, captures, torments, tortures, and even kills would be child molesters with a highly dememted idealism to right the ills of contemporary society. Had the film makers had any real guts they would of left well enough alone, instead they tried to create a reason to justify Haley's grotesque enjoyment of inflicting cruelty on her victoms by turning Jeff into a person who once killed a young girl who resisted his molestations, as if being a serial molester is not enough. The point is, that any viewer of this material with a shread of sophistication will realize right of the bat that there is no way on God's green Earth to sanctify what Haley is doing, so this manipulation of the plot only hurt the believability of the picture.Like a good neighbor..............NOT!Haley is spotted by neighbor lady ""Susan Oh"" walking on Jeff's roof. When Susan Oh knocks on the door this person she has never seen befor answeres and says she is Jeff's niece. Jeff is heard in the background making muffled moans, Haley says he has food poisoning and is very sick. Haley also has a sizable fresh red bloody gash on her forhead. With all these red flag warning signs going off like so many flash bulbs in Susan Oh's face, what does she ask Haley?""Do you baby sit.""Last part: Film job. ( I did the math so you don't have to.)This film is an editing nightmare, not only because of the MTV flash cutting, but also because of the continual manipulation of color and tone, for instance, if Haley gets mad, the tone becomes blue and cold, if a character goes outside, the light is overexposed. In an attept to end this review, I am going to write about a scene in this film in which Haley ransack Jeff's place in search of his incriminating evidence. What makes this worthy of discussion is that from the moment she begins searching to the point that she unearths his safe which is hidden in an indoor rock garden, there are a total of 65 edits, 24 of which are jump cuts. A jump cut is when the editor takes out a segment of frames from a sustained shot so that the person in the frame, (in this case Ellen Page), skips into the futre a 10th of a second at a time. Now all of these jump cuts have the same elements in common, first they are all of Ellen Page, second they are all action shots of her searching for his compromising material, third they are all shot by a camera that was being deliborately manipulated to swim around side to side, and up and down to create unease and tention. Of the 65 total edits, 40 of them were segments where the camera was swimming around the subject. What makes this scene such a chore to watch is that this moment only lasts 86 seconds, so why does it need 65 edits? Well welcome to the world of low attention span theatre, apparently director David Slade must think that his viewers are hummingbirds.My advice to the film makers is to treat the viewer as if they are capable of figuring things out for themselves and drawing there own conclusion, please don't insult the viewers intelligence. My advice to the viewer, go ahead and watch Hard Candy, but also watch the Takashi Miike film Audition which has a similar theme but is actually worthy of being called a cult classic...Then decide for yourself.",3,I think I'm turning Japanese.,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,8169,"['Hard', 'Candy', 'film', 'outside', 'few', 'unscenic', 'outdoor', 'shots', 'was', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'safe',

645590,A3UA40JOD3BE1M,B00005JP3W,"Paul Fogarty ""Hopeless film addict!""","[2, 6]","Whether you love it, or loath it, one thing that I think most people can agree with is that ""Hard Candy"" signals the arrival of a major new talent... Ellen Page, co-staring as ""Hayley Stark,"" alongside Patrick Wilson's ""Jeff Kohlver."" For someone so young - only 15 or 16 when she made this - Page's performance is astonishing. One minute she's a fumbling and embarrassed teen almost out of her depth on her first date with an older man, the next, a terrifyingly twisted and disturbed angel of vengeance, determined to visit bloody retribution on a man she accuses of being a pedophile, and possibly even a murderer.This basic scenario is given to us up-front in the film's marketing material, and in the Amazon review above; I'm guessing that the filmmakers thought they HAD to give away the old-switcheroo at the outset, otherwise, how many people would go to the theatre to see a film about a pedophile stalking a 14yr old girl?!The initial meeting between Hayley and Jeff at the Nighthawks Caf&eacute; - a kind-of Starbucks knock-off but without the Internet access! LOL! - is masterfully handled, especially by Page. It's almost as if she isn't acting at all, in an extraordinarily nuanced performance, the body language, the flickering and uncertain expressions, the fumbled gestures and words are so natural that you really believe you're looking at a young girl barely into her teens. And that's quite a trick, considering that we KNOW she's going to transform into the teen-psycho-slasher-babe-from-Hell in a very short period of time!And lest you think this review is turning into a fully paid-up member of the Ellen Page fan club - LOL! - let's NOT forget Patrick Wilson's performance as Jeff. Wilson has an incredibly tough job to do here; we the audience suspect, we think we know, that he IS the monster Hayley will soon accuse him of being, but we can't be sure, so we have to be able to sympathize with Jeff, at least to a degree, and Wilson's performance compliments Page's beautifully. In this initial meeting, after weeks of on-line chatting, Jeff is smooth, urbane, cultured and sophisticated, as Haley says, ""You really just don't look like kind of guy who needs to meet girls over the Internet."" In fact, Jeff, a successful fashion photographer, is so hip and so cool that he even drives one of those funky new Mini Coopers around town. But something dark and edgy hides just beneath the surface, and we get a glimpse of that in his reply to Hayley's previous compliment, ""...When you work as a photographer you find out real quick peoples faces lie."" ""Does my face lie?"" is Hayley's guileless response.After this initial set-up the action quickly moves to Jeff's house in the LA hills via a vaguely unsettling scene where, at Hayley's urging, Jeff gets down on his knees and ""worships"" her in the parking lot. There's also a nicely edited sequence where we see Hayley's steely resolve peeking out for the first time from behind the ""cute"" exterior in a self-satisfied smile to herself as they wind their way through the hills. To say that Jeff AND Hayley both harbor secrets is putting it mildly!Once they arrive at Jeff's home, which doubles as his photographic studio, things take a very serious turn for the worse - for Jeff! - and it's here that the film really takes off, and spends the majority of its 100+ minute running time. To say that things become intense is an understatement; the majority of the film is just Hayley and Jeff on screen together, figuratively and metaphorically tearing each other to pieces, the camera follows them around, prowling through the house in extended takes reminiscent of Hitchcock's ""Rope.""Jeff finally understands that things aren't going as, he planned, when he wakes up from one-too-many Screwdrivers tied to a chair with a shirt over his head. His oh-so-cute and beguiling ingenue is nowhere to be seen, having been replaced by a brittle and explosively violent whack-job stridently accusing him of being a child molester!I won't go into what happens next as many other reviews have already covered that, some, in fact, appear to fixate on Hayley's proposed act of ""preventative maintenance"" as if that's all there is to the film, but once again, just as in the opening scenes at Nighthawks, what makes this work for me are the masterful performances.Hayley veers, frighteningly, between barely controlled anger, sneering contempt, feigned concern, and seething rage that boils to the surface repeatedly. One of the most telling scenes for me is one where Jeff almost escapes, and after barely managing to subdue him, Hayley turns her rage and anger at losing control of the situation, against herself... ouch!When Jeff is initially faced with Hayley's accusations of pedophilia and maybe even murder, he reacts in the only way he can, blustering self-righteous denial and outrage at the very suggestion. But as his situation becomes progressively worse, as Hayley digs ever deeper into his secret world, and lets him know what she intends to do, he desperately tries to find a way to ""get through"" to her. As a professional photographer he's used to being in control of situations, of communicating his ideas and wants to the models he shoots, of getting under their skin, to see what makes them tick, so that he can draw that ever elusive ""something"" out into the open and capture it on film. But Hayley is more than a match for him, she contemptuously throws his attempts at empathy back in his face, 'til he's reduced to whining, blaming others to justify his own past actions, and ultimately begging her not to destroy him.These scenes are strong meat, emotionally draining, and lead, via the much-talked about ""maintenance"" sequence - which IS squirm inducing! - to an inevitable and nihilistic ending. I'm not saying that the resolution to the film is telegraphed or easy to spot - I didn't see it coming 'til it was too late, as it were - but given the set-up and the situation the characters find themselves in, there was no other way to finish the story, and to that end it is, to my mind, eminently satisfying.Mind you, as much as I obviously thoroughly enjoyed ""Hard Candy,"" the film is not without its flaws; one particular scene of Hayley manhandling an unconscious Jeff had me thinking ""No WAY!"" and some of the situations do feel somewhat forced and contrived.

Within 5 minutes I had this movie figured out and had a pretty good idea how it was going to go down. Nearly the entirety of the film is devoted to a verbal face off between the main characters, so if sitting on your couch watching a series of talking head shots for over an hour sounds like fun, by all means get this. The mock internet chat and subsequent dialogue is not at all intriguing. It's not even realistic or clever. However, what killed it for me was that if you are going to drive a film with only two characters, they need to be good characters. I found nothing interesting or likable in either of them. Rather than riveting and terrifying, every moment felt awkward and contrived. Ellen might as well be an Elien (see what I did) as far as her portrayal of a 14 yr old girl is concerned. She lacks emotion, charm, and the things she says are unrealistic. I also could never get over her very short hair... The antagon.. protagonist? Hell, I don't even know who's supposed to be what. He's equally lacking in charm and personality. I guess he's supposed to come off as creepy, but other than his weird attraction I never had reason to feel alarmed or concerned for the girl.

645594,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B00005JP3W,Peter Baklava,"[5, 7]","""Hard Candy"" boasts a very smartly written script, with crackling adversarial dialogue that nearly equals David Mamet for inventiveness and cynicism.  Even the popular references (Zadie Smith, Goldfrapp) are spot on.  Young actress Ellen Page takes that script and runs with it, turning in a stunningly credible performance.The plot formula is simple.  A smooth but lazy predator ( Jeff, the 32 yr. old professional photographer) trawls through the Internet, only to fall into the clutches of a younger, smarter and more ruthless predator.  Hayley, the seemingly innocent 14 yr. old object that has caught Jeff's attention,  in reality is the quick-witted velociraptor to Jeff's ready-for-extinction, toothless dinosaur.  She carves him up (figuratively)  in no time at all.This movie did come up with a new wrinkle, upping the ante by introducing a credible adolescent female psychopath (why psychopath?  because she repeatedly says she's crazy, and by the measure of the cruelty she enjoys inflicting, she clearly is ).  The ""deadlier than the male"" theme  has been handed down through a succession of movies, including ""Body Heat"", ""Single White Female', ""Fatal Attraction"",  ""Basic Instinct.""  ""Hard Candy"" is stripped down, and very riveting.But, as others have pointed out,  it is like a theatrical play, which takes place in very limited sets.  To reward repeated viewings, movies usually have to have other elements going for them.  ""Manhunter"", the first Hannibal Lechter movie, had a great score.  ""Wait Until Dark""  (another theatrical-style thriller)  had great pacing and dynamics.  ""Hard Candy"" just seems a little one-dimensional to ever be called a classic.  It's so focused on two characters that when Sandra Oh thrusts her moonish face into the mix for two minutes,  her appearance is jarring, disruptive, and nearly comical.When a movie relies on shock value,  it needs other things to back it up.  Case in point--""Hannibal"" (sorely lacking in substance, heavy on shock ).  I would advise buyers to rent this one.  It will hold your attention really well for one viewing.

Seriously, I think the convicted child molester should be forced by the court to watch this film. Secondly Ellen page gives one of the greatest performaces by a young actress since Tatum O'Neil did Paper Moon. She was absolutely astonishing. It's one of the greatest performances by a teenager I have ever seen. Patrick Wilson was also brilliant. So what about the subject matter of the film? Simply put, it's a lesson to every male who has ever thought about or attempted to take advantage of a child to think twice. The character Page plays looks absolutely as cute and innocent as any kid could possibly seem, As does the older male character that Wilson plays. For a probable pervert he seems like the most decent guy on the plant. He is very sweet to her. A perfect gentleman. He even tries to ignore her presumed sensual prowess and sexually suggestive comments. Not to let too much out of the bag I will say that at first you might be led to think he's just too nice of a guy to deserve any of what happens to him later in the film. At first things appear as though this is a teenage girl with a chip on her shoulder who has possibly picked the wrong guy to torment. The fact is she has some rather serious mental issues once the films shows what she is capable of. I felt at first like the guy didn't seem to deserve what she ends up doing to him. But by the end you learn enough that you'll almost feel that what happens was justified. No matter how awful things get for him it somehow seems like real justice.

645608,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JP3W,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 3]","Hard Candy (David Slade, 2005)It's odd: I went through the first nine months of 2006 seeing movies that were mediocre to bad, for the most part. Now, within the space of a week and a half, I've seen Advise and Consent, Hard Core Logo, and Hard Candy, and if I were making up a list of the ten best films I saw in 2006, I'd have a very, very hard time choosing one of the three to top it.Now, I should warn you from the outset: this is one of those films that you will either love or hate, probably depending on how you feel about the subject matter itself. It's hard to summarize the plot, or even give the obvious comparisons, without spoilers-- and it should be mentioned here that the advertising campaign for this movie was about as perfect as it gets in its painstaking insistence on not giving a single blessed thing away about this flick while still keeping interest levels high; the final three-quarters of the movie I never saw coming. Bravo to the marketing team (and that's something I almost never say).In any case, the drama here surrounds to characters: photographer Jeff Kohlver (Angels in America's Patrick Wilson) and teen Hayley Stark (X-Men: The Last Stand's Ellen Page). In the opening scene, there's some typical online flirting that leads to a meeting between the two; Jeff is painted as something of a morally ambivalent character from the outset, but nothing here is going to prepare you for what follows-- none of which I can tell you about without spoilers. You'll have to see it for yourself.As I said, it's the subject matter that will cause your reaction to this film, because how the subject matter is handled is absolutely above reproach. Both Wilson and Page play their roles to the hilt without overplaying them (though there are some clever uses of, shall we say, mood-altering substances that allow for some latitude in that regard); the film is written by Brian Nelson, who's penning the script for the upcoming 30 Days of Night, and it's directed by David Slade of Do Geese See God?. Everyone here, with the ironic exception of some of the cameos (Sandra Oh makes a brief appearance) and Page-- who's been in the business for about a decade, having gotten her start in the good TV series Pit Pony back in the day-- is a relative newcomer to this business, and all of them show that they have a very, very good handle on how to make a bang-up movie.The spoiler thing is frustrating, because there are two films to which I'd like to favorably compare this movie, one of them firmly lodged in my top ten favorite films of all time. But, as I keep saying, you'll just have to see it for yourself. It falls squarely into a particular subgenre of thriller that seems to turn out excellent movies whenever it pops up, and Hard Candy is no exception. You will love this film or you will hate it, but either way, you have to admit that the folks who made this movie did one hell of a good job getting you to love it or hate it.

In the DVD bonus commentaries, the actors and director take exception to the impression some people had that this movie must have been adapted from a stage play. They protest that, to the contrary, this movie is supremely cinematic.I DID think this material looked as if it might have been adapted from a stage play. But to me, that isn't a negative. You get the best of both worlds here. You get the personal immediacy of a play, without a clutter of special effects and extras. But unlike being at a play, you get a telling close-up of the actors' faces. And that's everything in this intense game of cat and mouse.The acting is gripping, although I think that Patrick Wilson looks a little too nice to be a sexual predator. Not that all predators have to look seedy and suspect. But Wilson lacks that glinting, concentrated quality that comes of having a hidden agenda in every encounter. However Ellen Page is brilliant as his intended teenage victim. She blazes with genius, both practical and philosophical, as she counters each one of the predator's self-justifying arguments in turn.The movie looses some logic towards the end. I don't see the inevitability of the end in the same way the characters do. But that's a relatively small flaw in a generally realistically noir film.Neither of the two bonus DVD commentaries is very good. Listening to them tends to detract from the impact of the movie you've just watched. The actors' commentary is slightly better than the writer's. However you probably do need to listen to at least one of these running commentaries in order to pick up on a key point in the movie's action.

An intimate (only five speaking roles) psychological thriller, for most of its running time, it dares to implicate the viewer in the misdeeds the two main characters engage in.  Thirtysomething photographer Jeff (Patrick Wilson) talks to smart, precocious teenager Hayley (Ellen Page) over the internet, and soon arrange a meeting.  They go to Jeff's apartment and have a few drinks.  Jeff falls unconscious, and upon waking up, discovers that Hayley has drugged and tied him to a chair.  She intends to expose him as a pedophile by any means necessary.Is Jeff a pervy predator or just a lonely guy?  Is Hayley driven by righteous vengenance or psychosis?  The razor sharp dialogue by screenwriter Brian Nelson asks provocative questions about morality, sexuality and justice.  It's unfortunate that by the end, the film decides for us who the real villain is, and thus answers many of its own questions.  Also unfortunately, what the viewer is mainly left wondering about are the nuts-and-bolts who/what/where/why/hows of the backstory.  Finally, ""Grey's Anatomy"" actress Sandra Oh is wasted in a tiny role that's purely functional.Nevertheless, there's an overwhelming amount of evidence to strongly recommend the film.  Even though the action mainly takes place in Jeff's apartment, Slade keeps things moving at a brisk pace, and the script is so alive with twisted energy that to say the least, one is never bored.  The setup is so simple and provocative, it's a wonder it hasn't been done before (okay, films revolving around pedophilia are kind of a tough sell).  Best of all, Page's performance is near-revelatory--she creates a character that is both convincingly righteous and completely insane.  No matter how frustrating the resolution, you know you've just seen something you won't soon forget.  If you're a guy who's ever pitched a tent while watching a Britney Spears video and instantly felt sleazy, ""Hard Candy"" will scare you limp.",5,"""Playtime is over.

Take an interesting script, put two great actors in a room and you have yourself a really good film. This is what they did with this one, and if it wasn't for the fact that towards the end the script tries to over-complicate the development of the action, it would have been a true home run.Ellen Page plays the role of 14-year-old Hayley Stark, a girl that entraps a suspected pedophile and looks to delivering justice by herself. Even though Page was eighteen at the time, she delivers a convincing performance, and we can truly feel the ruthlessness of the character coming through. Patrick Wilson plays Jeff Kohlver, a guy that at the bare minimum likes to flirt with young girls and at worst is a true monster. The film keeps us guessing as to which one it is, and in the process deliver psychological thrills like you have not often seen.Sadly, towards the end, the story becomes a little too convoluted for my taste, but overall the result is satisfactory. It is true though that you have to be in a special frame of mind to watch this film, and some people may not like it at all, since it has a rawness that will bother part of the audience, and it covers uncomfortable topics to say the least. This is not a movie you pick to watch to relieve stress from a tough week at work, since it will probably make the situation worse.

OK. He must be guilty of something, and that alleged crime must be something related to a female victim or victims. Can't find proof or evidence? Drug the guy, tie him up and do nasty things. Nevermind, he collects pictures of females, he must be guilty of something! For over than an hour, you get to hear about the man's elusive ""guilt"" of what the gal thinks he might have committed.

Her morality, which is pivotal, becomes increasingly ambiguous as the film progresses, and the violence, although it mostly takes place out of shot, verges uncomfortably close to torture porn, displacing any message that might have been intended, and polarising the viewer's sympathies.

Either way, it definently makes you think.  The film is typical as to some lions gate movies I've seen latley.

While they are all decent actors I've seen no performance as powerful as Ellen Page's in years. Hands down she deserves the Oscar for best actress. She TOTALLY takes over this movie and makes it her own. Although 18 when it was filmed, she convincingly plays a 14 year old girl.Ms. Page's performance is masterful, especially for someone of her age. To me there's a few modes of acting where a performer can shine. Take the Godfather saga. Of course when Al Pacino explodes over his wife's abortion you are knocked out of your seat by it's power. That's generally accepted as good, powerful acting. But I think when The Godfather, Brando, sees his son Sonny's body in the funeral home and tentatively whispers ""Look what they did to my boy"" it's just as powerful in an understated way. Then there's also that mode in between the sheer power of a screaming maniac, and a tentative understatement of a sensitive performance there's that underlying rage and control that Pacino, Brando, and DeNiro show in the Godfather series.In Hard Candy Ms. Ellen Page covers all these bases from sheer power, to true understatement and sensitivity. One minute your on her side of the story, and the next your thinking she's the insane one who should ""get it"" because she's gone too far.I just can't say enough about her performance as you can read here.I don't want to take away from Patrick Wilson's fine performance either. He provides the perfect foil for Ms. Page to play off of. Considering that the two main characters take up 99% of this movie is also a testament to their fine acting skills. It should be noted that this was filmed in about 2 weeks with not a huge budget. Isn't amazing when you watch a movie that totally enthralls you and you see the credits you realize there were only a couple of characters in the film?I do have a few minor complaints about the movie. I'm a bit sick of close in Steady cam jolting cinematography, but in this case it works well. It's needed to see every nuance on ""Haleys"" face. I also think the movie would have had even a more powerful ending if the last 25 second scene was left out. It does get a slight bit predictable as I figured out what would happen in the end, but that's OK, it is better that than some convoluted ending.I had the pleasure of seeing this movie without any description beforehand so I had no idea what to expect. I would like to add that I think it ruins this movie with many of these reviews that describe exactly what happens in this movie. More than a basic description isn't needed. This is a powerful movie, and it is unsettling.

645621,A1VABWDOUQLULZ,B00005JP3W,S. K. Harrell,"[1, 3]","I knew the deal going in, first off.  However, that did not prepare me for the sinister nature of the film--from all sides, for the emotions and thoughts the characters' involvement evoked, or for the lingering creepy psychological impact of the perspectives presented.  Who to sympathise with?  Anyone?  I'm not sure.  Haley was equally as awful as Jeff, though I have to fully admit that at first it was captivating to observe how articulately and eloquently she put it to him.  The self-confessed irony of her character is that she is a little girl not able to do what a woman can.  My thoughts on that were that she did dispassionately what a woman would likely be too emotionally involved to do.  The terror that can be exacted by teenaged girls is no better shown that in this film.There were a lot of intuitive leaps on the sequence of events that did not work for me, and a few holes in Haley's logic.  In order for me to fully buy that Haley was what I was supposed to believe she was, I need to understand how she got there, and that information was missing from the film.

645622,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B00005JP3W,Sky,"[4, 6]","Wow. Talk about puttin' someone on ice! In Hard Candy Ellen Page (Hayley) puts Patrick Wilson's character (Jeff) on ice in the figurative and literal sense of the phrase.Page is young looking enough to play 14 year old Hayley who takes vigilantism to a tortuous level in Hard Candy. Page was actually 18 when Hard Candy was released. But Page's character has a major flaw: it's one of those characters that is completely unbelievable...you know, super-intellect for a teenager with (seemingly) superpowers.Director David Slade, a directorial youngster himself, could have made a much more realistic movie if he had just made his diabolical leading lady equally vindictive but a little more naive. Instead, Page's character Hayley comes across as a 30-something year old with a Masters in English Debate that's been through boot camp. Simply far fetched.Patrick Wilson (memorable for his 2004 film version performance in Phantom of the Opera) saves the film from unrealistic disaster as relatively believable in his role as 32 year old underage-girl-lover Jeff.Page and Wilson occupy the screen for 98% of the movie. The dialogue between the two is fast and keeps you watching. The torture is mostly left to the viewer's imagination; Hard Candy is not a bloody movie. It's a movie about revenge that is designed to stir the debate over the definition of who constitutes a criminal...the villain?...the vigilante?...or both?Overall, I was entertained.

At the beginning of the movie I thought I was going to identify with Ellen Page's character, because of course the guy was supposed to be the ""bad guy"" pedophile. Normally I am pretty disgusted with men (or women) who pursue and sleep with children or teenagers. But as the film went on I realized that there are is no good or bad guy in this movie.By the time it got to the part where he tells his childhood story of abuse, I actually found myself identifying with him more so than Hayley. His story was emotionally heartbreaking for me to hear, and I found myself angry and digusted with his aunt. I also identified less and less with Hayley, until I started to feel like she is not a victim at all, but a perpetrator herself. The castration of another human being is disgusting and wrong, and we are supposed to believe that a young teenage girl actually did this? She must have had some severe trauma with men in her past. I don't know if the filmmakers wanted the viewers to see this as some sort of revenge thing, but if that's what they were going for then they really failed. The way I viewed the movie, it seems like everyone is a victim and a perpetrator all at the same time. Hayley was a victim in that she was pursued by Jeff who planned on taking advantage of her, but she is also a perpetrator because she abuses him. Jeff was a victim of child abuse and is now a perpetrator. It leaves you with a rather depressed feeling.I was disappointed with the ending.

They go into chatrooms, IM people who identify themselves as teenagers in the chatroom, and the pedo starts off as being a stranger online to a teen, but after weeks of chatting and compliments, this child molester is no longer a stranger, but now a good friend.These adults act real sweet, funny, and friendly with a teenager online because they know some teens are very insecure, and that being a teen can be a tough age, thus they can be easily tricked by people who appear to care and ""understand"" them. Their parents and teachers and even their friends may not ""get"" them, but this person they are chatting with online does.Little do these poor kids realize these grown-up's are only interested in one thing, and are only looking to earn the teen's trust so they can then make their move.This stuff has gone on for years, and goes on all over the world.In the case with the film ""Hard Candy"" - After three weeks of pleasantly chatting online, both Jeff and Hayley decide to meet at a local coffee shop in real life.Jeff and Hayley have great chemistry, and you would think with the way the two communicate that this was the start of a blossoming new romance, and the film has the makings of what could have been a good romantic film.Except there's a big problem that both Jeff and we the audience are aware of:Hayley is a 14-year old girl, and while Jeff doesn't appear to be a sexually graphic pervert in their online chats and in real life, the way he speaks to Hayley in such a flirtatious way is still creepy because we the audience know she is only fourteen, as does Jeff.He buys her chocolate and a t-shirt, and he gives her all sorts of compliments that any insecure 14-year old girl would appreciate such as""Well, you look older then what you are, and you certainly act older then what you are.""Fourteen is a very emotionally-charged age, and being told you look and act older then what you are by an adult you respect is something that a lot of fourteen-year old's would love to hear, and Jeff and men like him know that, and they groom so many young women with the hope that they will score with them, not at all caring that having sex as such a young age (especially with a grown adult) can damage a person mentally forever.It's also disturbing just knowing that in too many cases these men only like these girls because of their age, and don't really care about them. It's just a fetish for them, so what happens to a girl that they have sex with after she grows up is of no little interest to them.Jeff is also not an ugly man by any means. Far from it - He's very handsome, he's young, he has money, is very giving, and is the type of man any woman of any age would love to be with. Sadly, Jeff has a few dark secrets. One of them clearly being is he likes his women young. Too young.As the film plays on, we the audience learn Jeff has a few more disturbing secrets.However.....Hayley has a few dark secrets of her own.That's all I'll type because I don't desire to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it. I watched this movie knowing very little, so everything was a surprise for me. This film has all sorts of twists and turns that will leave your head spinning. I found this to be one of the most darkest, disturbing and shocking films I've ever seen! It's a horror film for computer predators and their victims! It has a real creepy, dark, and depressing atmosphere.There will be times this film will just make you feel miserable, but it will keep your attention, and entertain you.It also has an artsy, indy film feel to it. It's a very well made film with wonderful writing, directing and acting. The instrumental music is great and the cinematography on the screen is just beautiful.This is a movie that makes you think and does not tell you who the good guy is or who the bad guy is. It's not about telling you what to think. It's about making you think for yourself and you may be able to find out a lot about who you are based on what you think about this movie. I also think this is the type of movie you could end up watching a few times and may discover some things you did not notice the first time.Overall, this is a pretty stressful film that will most likely upset you. I'd type that this is a great film for parents to show their young teenagers IF it was not so disturbing.However, if you really desire to show some tough love and let your children know this kind of violence is out there and that they better be prepared for it, then this is actually a good movie to watch with them, but I'd watch it yourself first before deciding. It also would not hurt to watch it with them. That way you can censor this movie the way you see it if you like. You should talk to them about it between scenes maybe or after the movie. But please remember, this is not some kid-friendly after school special. It's raw, it's real, it's sick but you may end up saving your children's lives if you're bold enough to show them this. I think it's a lot better to watch pretend violence on a screen then be a victim of real violence.Be careful out there. It's a real jungle we live in outside of our doors and sometimes the internet isn't any safer.",5,"""Misery"" meets ""To Catch a Predator"".",1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,6041,"['Hard', 'Candy',

645637,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,B00005JP3W,The Wickerman,"[4, 5]","For its relatively short length and somewhat minimalistic setting, ""Hard Candy"" is a film that contains more depth and complexity than I could ever touch on all of in this review.The story centers around two main characters, a young girl named Haley (Ellen Page), who meets an older man on the internet (Patrick Wilson, not to be confused with the drummer from Weezer) whom she suspects to be a sexual predator.  At first, it appears that she is falling for his act and taking the bait, and as they go back to his house, it is apparent to the viewer that bad things are on the horizon.  This is true, but not at all in the way that you'd expect.  Haley soon reveals herself to be an extremely angry and vengeful person who was plotting all along to take her deep-seated rage out on this guy.  I won't go into the specifics, but things get quite unpleasant for this fellow.What ensues is a very interesting and horrific ballet between the two, in which you see a dizzying array of different emotional layers in both characters.  One of the most brilliant things about this movie is that there is really no designated ""hero"" or ""villian"" here, and it's almost like your sympathy is meant to shift from one character to the other.  Jeff (the male character) is indeed revealed to be a pretty bad person, but we also see numerous moments in which he appears sympathetic, and you almost feel sorry for him, even knowing what kind of person he really is.  Likewise, Haley, while an obviously intelligent person with largely good intentions, is so driven by her vengeance and rage that she frequently comes off as frighteningly psychotic.  The lines of ""good"" and ""evil"" are so heavily blurred between them at times that there almost seems to be no protagonist at all.One of the biggest themes, obviously, is the irrational justification of depravity.  Haley talks about being disgusted by the ways in which pedophiles attempt to justify their actions, but ironically she is doing the same thing herself.  In her own twisted way, she feels that she is doing what has to be done, even though her actions are just as horrific.  We see these two characters that are both sick and twisted, albeit in very different ways, and neither can see their own hypocrisy, even if they can recognize it in each other.  There is so much more that can be discussed here, but I think I'll leave it at that.Now it is time to once again praise the incredible Ellen Page.  Many know her as the lovable title character in ""Juno"", but here she proves her amazing versatility with a nearly polar opposite type of performance.  Her performance is dark, venomous, and downright bone-chilling, and even with her small and unimposing stature creates a truly terrifying character.  But again, she's not a complete monster, and Ellen does an incredible job of bringing many different levels to the character.  Likewise, Wilson does the same for Jeff, in the sense that he is never completely a villian or a victim.  There is so much complexity to both characters, and both actors do an amazing job of bringing all those different facets together in their respective roles.The cinematography is awesome as well.  David Slade (who more recently did ""30 Days of Night"") is characteristic for using this sort of jerky camera effect, to give the sequences a sort of nightmarish surrealism.  The whole thing almost feels like a frightening dream, and entirely taking place between two characters in a small setting, it is all the more nightmarish.This is definitely not an easy film to watch, nor is it recommended to the faint of heart, but it is a brilliant examination of the dark side of human nature.  Whether you love it hate it, it will definitely stay with you long after it's over.",5,He who fights monsters must see that he does not become a monster himself...,1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,3747,"['relatively', 'short', 'length', 'somewhat', 'minimalistic', 'setting', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'film', 'more', 'depth', 'complexity', 'could', 'ever', 'touch', 'review.The', 'story', 'centers', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Haley', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'who', 'older', 'man', 'internet', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'drummer', 'Weezer', 'whom', 'be', 'sexual', 'predator', 'first', 'falling', 'act', 'taking', 'bait', 'go', 'back', 'house', 'apparent', 'viewer', 'bad', 'things', 'are', 'horizon', 'true', 'not', 'way', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Haley', 'soon', 'be', 'extremely', 'angry', 'vengeful', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'plotting', 'all', 'along', 'take', 'deep-seated', 'rage', 'out', 'guy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'specifics', 'things', 'get', 'quite', 'unpleasant', 'fellow.What', 'very', 'interesting', 'horrific', 'ballet', 'two', 'see', 'dizzying', 'array', 'different', 'emotional', 'layers', 'characters', 'One', 'most', 'brilliant', 'things', 'movie', 'really', 'no', 'designated', 'hero', 'villian', 'here', 'almost', 'sympathy', 'meant', 'shift', 'one', 'character', 'other', 'Jeff', 'male', 'character', 'indeed', 'revealed', 'be', 'pretty', 'bad', 'person', 'also', 'see', 'numerous', 'moments', 'sympathetic', 'almost', 'feel', 'sorry', 'even', 'knowing', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'really', 'Likewise', 'Haley', 'obviously', 'intelligent', 'person', 'largely', 'good', 'intentions', 'so', 'driven', 'vengeance', 'rage', 'frequently', 'off', 'frighteningly', 'psychotic', 'lines', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'so', 'heavily', 'blurred', 'times', 'almost', 'be', 'protagonist', 'all.One', 'biggest', 'themes', 'obviously', 'irrational', 'justification', 'depravity', 'Haley', 'talks', 'being', 'disgusted', 'ways', 'pedophiles', 'attempt', 'justify', 'actions', 'ironically', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'own', 'twisted', 'way', 'doing', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'even', 'actions', 'are', 'just', 'horrific', 'see', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'sick', 'twisted', 'very', 'different', 'ways', 'can', 'see', 'own', 'hypocrisy', 'even', 'can', 'recognize', 'other', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'discussed', 'here', 'think', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'that.Now', 'time', 'once', 'again', 'praise', 'incredible', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Many', 'know', 'lovable', 'title', 'character', 'Juno', 'here', 'amazing', 'versatility', 'nearly', 'polar', 'opposite', 'type', 'performance', 'performance', 'dark', 'venomous', 'downright', 'bone-chilling', 'even', 'small', 'unimposing', 'stature', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'character', 'again', 'not', 'complete', 'monster', 'Ellen', 'incredible', 'job', 'bringing', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'character', 'Likewise', 'Wilson', 'same', 'Jeff', 'sense', 'never', 'completely', 'villian', 'victim', 'so', 'much', 'complexity', 'characters', 'actors', 'do', 'amazing', 'job', 'bringing', 'different', 'facets', 'together', 'respective', 'roles.The', 'cinematography', 'awesome', 'as', 'well', 'David', 'Slade', 'who', 'more', 'recently', 'did', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'characteristic', 'using', 'sort', 'jerky', 'camera', 'effect', 'give', 'sequences', 'sort', 'nightmarish', 'surrealism', 'whole', 'thing', 'almost', 'feels', 'frightening', 'dream', 'entirely', 'taking', 'place', 'two', 'characters', 'small', 'setting', 'more', 'nightmarish.This', 'definitely', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'recommended', 'faint', 'heart', 'brilliant', 'examination', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'love', 'hate', 'will', 'definitely', 'stay', 'long', 'over']",N/A

645642,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JP3W,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 3]","Already praised by some as modern-day fable based on the Little Red Riding Hood story, `Hard Candy' handles its controversial subject matter with tactful direction from the first-time director David Slade. He wisely avoided nudities or too direct descriptions of violence, but still because of exceptionally realistic acting from the two leads Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page, some parts of `Hard Candy' are very disturbing, making some of you feel not a little uncomfortable.In short, `Hard Candy' is a thriller or a tale of a fourteen-year-old girl who does a very bad thing to a middle-aged male who thinks he is a clever guy. It is about Hayley and Jeff, both of whom are seen engage in mind games after chatting on the net and meeting actually each other. You can easily see what Jeff is really thinking about when he meets the `little girl' at the beginning. The point is, the little girl also knows it too, and turns the tables when he asks her to drink something in his room.The rest of the film is about the battles, mental and physical, between these two characters. Except the brief appearance of Sandra Oh and Odessa Rae, the entire scenes are shot with only these two characters and the background about them are slowly revealed during the course of the narrative, which is greatly helped by the skillful camera work of David Slade.There is a surprise or two (depending on how you count) at the end of the film, but I don't think they are necessary. The film begins and develops its story finely with a cautious pace, which renders each scene very realistic, but in the second half the tightly knit settings begin to lose power with implausibility of some events and unaccountable motives of the characters. Like some B-horror films (which `Hard Candy' is not), we have to see someone refuse to do the most reasonable thing when he has to do it.

645644,AI0PLL5DQAHRG,B00005JP3W,"Ty Arthur ""xFiruath""","[1, 6]","Hard Candy is one of those movies that aren't really made to be big blockbusters.  Viewers probably won't want a bucket full of popcorn and no one will pronounce it the ""thrill ride adventure of the summer!"", however, it does deal with subject matter that is eminently relevant to the current time and will undoubtedly develop a serious following and cult status as one of the best films to be released in recent memory.  The idea behind Hard Candy is at first very simple.  A thirty something photographer is chatting with a fourteen year old girl online.  Eventually they decide to meet, and it's assumed the man has dubious intentions.  The producers of this film put it out at the perfect time.  MSNBC's series about pedophiles, ""To Catch a Predator"" is currently on it's seventh running, and thoughts of priests molesting boys is always just at the back of the collective memory.Hard Candy deals with the subject of pedophilia in a fairly mature manner, and takes things to a completely different level than any film previously has done.  Shortly into the film the audience's preconceived notions of what is going on will be completely shattered and the film takes a very dark bent, filled mostly with verbal sparring back and forth.  Viewers with weak stomachs should know beforehand that there are a few graphic scenes, surprisingly not of nudity or sex, but of violence.  The violence in the film is generally done much differently than in other movies as well, with much of it being psychologically torturous in nature, rather than out and out physical abuse.  The psychological nature of the violence doesn't lessen it's impact in any way - there are scenes here just as brutal and unrelenting as those in the likes of Hostel, The Hills Have Eyes, or Wolf Creek.  The cast does a superb job of acting.  The actress who plays the little girl Haley is on top of her game, doing everything almost perfectly.  The viewer will develop an emotional connection with the characters, and will definitely have very strong feelings towards Haley - but probably not in the way that would initially be assumed.The movie presents several viewpoints on the subject of pedophilia, alternating between condemnation and revelation, and even attempts to give a few answers to the tough questions surrounding the issue.  The only problem with Hard Candy is the ending.  The audience is led to believe throughout the entire film that a certain fact is true, and then that fact is suddenly turned on it's head in the last five minutes.  The way in which this is done seems as though the director wanted to give the audience's anger that has been building throughout the entire movie a conduit to be extinguished by providing meaning for the seemingly meaningless acts of violence that have occurred.  While this gives some closure to the story, it unfortunately lessens the effectiveness of the film as a whole.  Other than the ending, Hard Candy is nearly flawless.
