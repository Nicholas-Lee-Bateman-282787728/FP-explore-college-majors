1659948,A1CRNO7MNOKW50,B00DNQM7N6,Mike Leavitt,"[0, 0]",What can I say? I love Gary Cooper. Sergeant York is one of my favorites with a cast that includes a very young June Lockhart and young Walter Brennan.  The FountainHead is good And I believe Ayn Rand wrote the screen play for the movie. They are all good movies from the good old days.,5,Great classic movies,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,286,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'love', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Sergeant', 'York', 'one', 'favorites', 'cast', 'very', 'young', 'June', 'Lockhart', 'young', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'FountainHead', 'good', 'believe', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'wrote', 'screen', 'play', 'movie', 'are', 'good', 'movies', 'good', 'old', 'days']",TCM Greatest Classic Films: Legends - Gary Cooper
