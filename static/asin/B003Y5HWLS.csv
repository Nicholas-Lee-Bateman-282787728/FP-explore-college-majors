1375847,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003Y5HWLS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[11, 11]","The courtroom drama has become such a staple of American television, it is impossible to imagine a program with a completely unique approach to the genre.  Yet, you always hope a show can tweak the formula and give you something you haven't seen a hundred times previously.  While TNT's ""Franklin & Bash"" certainly isn't revolutionary television, it has its comedic sensibilities firmly in place.  The makers won't win any awards for believable legal work and sensible courtroom action, but that's precisely the point.  It is essentially a frat buddy comedy set in a professional arena.  Its goals are simple.  Aspiring to be lightly entertaining and fitfully funny, the show is a deft blend of humorous mayhem and good ole boy camaraderie.  Silly, juvenile, and wildly inappropriate--not one moment of ""Franklin & Bash"" resembles anything in real life.  And that's not all bad.  The show is fast paced, spry, and filled with likable actors.  Essential to its success are having lead characters that make the show fun.  Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Breckin Meyer, as the titular lawyers, have such a light and winning chemistry--it's hard not to be swept up in their joyful nonsense.The overall premise is fairly thin.  As unorthodox hustlers, our heroes come to the attention of the eccentric head of a prestigious law firm (played with easy charm by the great Malcolm McDowell) after winning a high profile case.  With the most tenuous of explanations (oh, the joys of TV land), the boys join the firm and seem to enjoy complete freedom and autonomy.  Even though their notorious courtroom antics infuriate every judge in the city, they are put to work for the most influential and important of clients.  But they are also free to accept bizarre personal assignments that would seem to make no money for the firm.  It's all good, though.  The boys are impish rascals who succeed (surprise, surprise) despite the most amusingly juvenile behavior imaginable.  Let's be honest, you have to just go with the premise--but if you can, there are plenty of laughs to be had along the way.Season One represents ten episodes.  My favorite features James Van Der Beek as the man marrying Gosselaar's former flame who needs representation after being ensnared in a prostitution sting.  Here, the frat boy attitude is at its strongest--the boys' home is one big party with neverending margaritas and non-stop Jacuzzi action.  In addition to the terrific leads, as well as McDowell, the rest of the cast is uniformly solid.  I will also single out Reed Diamond and Kumail Nanjiani for succeeding in rather stereotypical roles that might have come across as unappealing.  Diamond is McDowell's nephew and their primary rival at the firm--but holds his own against their playful antagonism.  And Nanjiani is their associate who is germ phobic and a shut-in.  This character might have been a cartoon, but is infinitely likable.  ""Franklin & Bash"" isn't likely to win any awards for quality, but as entertainment--it works just fine.  Easy to enjoy if you go with the flow.

1375849,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003Y5HWLS,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I wasn't sure what to expect from the first season of this series. I've enjoyed the actors in other things they've done and was hoping that they weren't just going to rehash their old characters into new names. They haven't and the show is a hoot. Heck it's two hoots.Peter Bash (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) and Jared Franklin (Breckin Myer) are two ambulance chasing attorney's who do things their own way. They're not beyond placing a distracting billboard sign near and intersection while waiting for an accident on which they can blame the billboard. They're a quirky duo who have two assistants that aren't any straighter than they are: Carmen (Dana Davis) is an ex-con who does their leg work for them and Pindar (Kumail Ninjiani) is an agoraphobic germ fanatic who does the computer/research for the team. But things are about to change.Enter Stanton Infield (Malcolm McDowell), the head of one of the biggest firms in the country. Having had his eye on the team for some time, he recruits them to come work for his firm. With no conditions except that they do their best, he sets them up in their own office, gives them anything they want and proceeds to send the oddest of clients their direction. Franklin and Bash proceed to do what they do best: win cases.Office politics have a place in the story as well. Reed Diamond stars as Damien Karp, the Infield's nephew and the starchy straight laced type lawyer who worries more about important clients than in doing the right thing. Franklin and Bash may twist the law a bit and be unorthodox, but they seem to work for bad guys. Also in the office is Hanna Linden (Garcelle Beauvais), an attractive high powered attorney in her own right, former flame of Damien and possible love interest for Franklin.All of these elements come into play from one episode to the next and none of the players major or minor are ignored. Rather than simply rely on the two main stars, the series lets everyone have a chance to play in this sandbox and it gives the show a team feeling that works for so many series these days.As I said in the title, the show is reminiscent of the series BOSTON LEGAL in that you have two off the wall characters involved in the business of law who work for a leader who has so many interests that you never know what he'll be doing next. He never appears to be odd but at the same time he's told the two main characters more than once that they remind him of himself when he was younger. It make for interesting characters and an interesting show as well.The cases the duo find themselves involved in never seem like the things you see on the front pages of the newspaper. After the pilot show, their first case involves a woman accused of using sex to kill her husband. Another features a somewhat plump young woman fired from a Playboy style magazine who thinks they fired her because she was too pretty. They defend two pole dance instructors who have been accused of stealing from one of their clients. Obviously these are not Perry Mason type cases they're working on.The thing that makes it work is the two leads. They seem to be completely at ease in their characters. Neither of them makes it seem like they're acting, a true accomplishment in my eyes for great acting. You don't feel like their performing but are being themselves. That could be a scary thing in some cases. As the series unfolds you get to know more about the characters, in particular the fact that Franklin refused to work for his father (Beau Bridges), a high class attorney with little scruples. There is a bitterness that lies between them and it reveals itself in one episode.I was hesitant to watch this series when it aired on TV. Now I find myself beginning to think that perhaps I should start setting the DVR for this one. Then again maybe I'll just wait for the second season to come out on DVD as well. I know I've thoroughly enjoyed season one and you will too.",4,"A SUCCESOR TO ""BOSTON LEGAL""",1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,3919,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'first', 'season', 'series', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'actors', 'other', 'things', ""'ve"", 'done', 'was', 'hoping', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'going', 'rehash', 'old', 'characters', 'new', 'names', 'have', ""n't"", 'show', 'hoot', 'Heck', 'two', 'hoots.Peter', 'Bash', 'Mark-Paul', 'Gosselaar', 'Jared', 'Franklin', 'Breckin', 'Myer', 'are', 'two', 'ambulance', 'chasing', 'attorney', 'who', 'do', 'things', 'own', 'way', ""'re"", 'not', 'placing', 'distracting', 'billboard', 'sign', 'intersection', 'waiting', 'accident', 'can', 'blame', 'billboard', ""'re"", 'quirky', 'duo', 'who', 'have', 'two', 'assistants', 'are', ""n't"", 'straighter', 'are', 'Carmen', 'Dana', 'Davis', 'ex-con', 'who', 'leg', 'work', 'Pindar', 'Kumail', 'Ninjiani', 'agoraphobic', 'germ', 'fanatic', 'who', 'computer/research', 'team', 'things', 'are', 'change.Enter', 'Stanton', 'Infield', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'head', 'one', 'biggest', 'firms', 'country', 'Having', 'had', 'eye', 'team', 'time', 'come', 'work', 'firm', 'conditions', 'do', 'best', 'up', 'own', 'office', 'anything', 'want', 'proceeds', 'send', 'oddest', 'clients', 'direction', 'Franklin', 'Bash', 'proceed', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'win', 'cases.Office', 'politics', 'have', 'place', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'Reed', 'Diamond', 'stars', 'Damien', 'Karp', 'Infield', 'nephew', 'starchy', 'straight', 'laced', 'type', 'lawyer', 'who', 'more', 'important', 'clients', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'Franklin', 'Bash', 'may', 'twist', 'law', 'bit', 'be', 'unorthodox', 'seem', 'work', 'bad', 'guys', 'Also', 'office', 'Hanna', 'Linden', 'Garcelle', 'Beauvais', 'attractive', 'high', 'powered', 'attorney', 'own', 'right', 'former', 'flame', 'Damien', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'Franklin.All', 'elements', 'come', 'play', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'none', 'players', 'major', 'minor', 'are', 'ignored', 'Rather', 'simply', 'rely', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'series', 'everyone', 'have', 'chance', 'play', 'sandbox', 'show', 'team', 'feeling', 'so', 'many', 'series', 'days.As', 'said', 'title', 'show', 'reminiscent', 'series', 'BOSTON', 'LEGAL', 'have', 'two', 'wall', 'characters', 'involved', 'business', 'law', 'who', 'work', 'leader', 'who', 'so', 'many', 'interests', 'never', 'know', 'what', ""'ll"", 'be', 'doing', 'next', 'never', 'be', 'odd', 'same', 'time', 'told', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'more', 'once', 'remind', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'make', 'interesting', 'characters', 'interesting', 'show', 'well.The', 'cases', 'duo', 'find', 'involved', 'never', 'seem', 'things', 'see', 'front', 'pages', 'newspaper', 'pilot', 'show', 'first', 'case', 'woman', 'accused', 'using', 'sex', 'kill', 'husband', 'somewhat', 'plump', 'young', 'woman', 'fired', 'Playboy', 'style', 'magazine', 'who', 'fired', 'was', 'too', 'pretty', 'defend', 'two', 'pole', 'dance', 'instructors', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'accused', 'stealing', 'one', 'clients', 'Obviously', 'are', 'not', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'type', 'cases', ""'re"", 'working', 'on.The', 'thing', 'work', 'two', 'leads', 'seem', 'be', 'completely', 'ease', 'characters', 'seem', ""'re"", 'acting', 'true', 'accomplishment', 'eyes', 'great', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'performing', 'are', 'being', 'could', 'be', 'scary', 'thing', 'cases', 'series', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'characters', 'particular', 'fact', 'Franklin', 'refused', 'work', 'father', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'high', 'class', 'attorney', 'little', 'scruples', 'bitterness', 'one', 'episode.I', 'was', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'series', 'when', 'aired', 'TV', 'Now', 'find', 'beginning', 'think', 'perhaps', 'should', 'start', 'setting', 'DVR', 'one', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'just', 'wait', 'second', 'season', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'know', ""'ve"", 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'one', 'will', 'too']",N/A
