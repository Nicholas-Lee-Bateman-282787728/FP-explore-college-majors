1129926,A2V0P9FMG2996Y,B001152THA,Cassandra (The Huge Anime Fan),"[0, 0]","Full, non-spoiler review courtesy at ~ Book & Movie Dimension a Blog ~Saya Otanashi is so far just an amnesiac teenage girl. Yet, behind the surface she comes to discover in an event that will change her life forever that she isn't human at all. Saya is a member of chiropracterans (vampires but like the type you'd never expect at all, way freakier). Thse chiropterans live on blood and murder humans. She's also one of the few of her species. She alone can destroy these ugly monsters. Her blood contains amazing attributes that eventually destroy them. Saya must for the most part throughout struggle to recall her origins along with her very attractive protector Haji. Who I should say is bound to her most of the time. Nobody is willing who knows of what Saya is capable to tell her because as you soon realize is a closely guarded secret for a reason. That's until, BAM!, we are introduced to Diva. Diva is Saya's sister. She couldn't not be bothered. What she reveals to Saya and not at all gently turns Saya's world into a void of uncertainty. Saya somehow finds the strength to get over her past which is very turbulent. As we travel with Saya in the series, her adoptive human family, also make themselves available to assist her in destroying the chiropterans that are very bloodthirsty. Blood + has some of the most appealing animation I have witnessed. Contains the best drama which includes plot twists just so you know. In short an amazing anime watch that fans of anime with a taste of Science Fiction will love forever.

1129927,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B001152THA,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[3, 11]","First of all I have to say that being a huge fan of the movie this is based on is what brought me to the series, which I didn't even know existed until just a few months ago. In the beginning I was extremely enthused about seeing where this series would take the story from where the film left off, unfortunately that enthusiasm was short-lived.I love the original movie the series is based on, but this follow up to the film does not do it justice whatsoever. I understand that whenever a series is made it has to flesh out the premise it's based on, unless it's already clearly established, but it wasn't with the original film which left the series with a daunting task.Unfortunately, this was a terrible extension of the film, which was intriguing and mysterious, while this series was anything but. It completely changes the feel and essence of what the movie introduced, and might as well have been an entirely different series, and in retrospect, it should have, because as it stands it tarnishes the reputation of the film.There's too much gratuitous violence as the series progresses, and the villains introduced are too clich&eacute;d and one in particular, the Phantom, is way too over the top and is completely incongruous with the theme of the show, and it was actually the turning point where it began going downhill, he's that bad.  The Phantom makes the series seem like a day time soap opera, almost.Too much time is spent on Saya's character coming into her own, and there's so much back and forth between her split personalities that it basically becomes a joke after awhile. If you're a fan of the film, skip this tripe, but if you haven't seen the film, then you might enjoy this since it has all the elements of any stereotypical teenage soap drama anime' and I know there are a lot of fans of that, but that doesn't do anything for me, intellectually or emotionally.",2,Not Nearly As Good As the Film It Is Based on,1225929600,"11 6, 2008",2008,1889,"['First', 'have', 'say', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'movie', 'based', 'what', 'brought', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'existed', 'just', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'beginning', 'was', 'extremely', 'enthused', 'seeing', 'where', 'series', 'would', 'take', 'story', 'where', 'film', 'left', 'off', 'unfortunately', 'enthusiasm', 'was', 'short-lived.I', 'original', 'movie', 'series', 'based', 'follow', 'up', 'film', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'whatsoever', 'understand', 'whenever', 'series', 'made', 'flesh', 'out', 'premise', 'based', 'already', 'clearly', 'established', 'was', ""n't"", 'original', 'film', 'left', 'series', 'daunting', 'task.Unfortunately', 'was', 'terrible', 'extension', 'film', 'was', 'intriguing', 'mysterious', 'series', 'was', 'anything', 'completely', 'feel', 'essence', 'what', 'movie', 'introduced', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'entirely', 'different', 'series', 'retrospect', 'should', 'have', 'reputation', 'film.There', 'too', 'much', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'series', 'villains', 'introduced', 'are', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'one', 'particular', 'Phantom', 'way', 'too', 'top', 'completely', 'incongruous', 'theme', 'show', 'was', 'actually', 'turning', 'point', 'where', 'began', 'going', 'downhill', 'bad', 'Phantom', 'series', 'seem', 'day', 'time', 'soap', 'opera', 'almost.Too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'Saya', 'character', 'coming', 'own', 'so', 'much', 'back', 'forth', 'split', 'personalities', 'basically', 'joke', 'awhile', ""'re"", 'fan', 'film', 'skip', 'tripe', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'then', 'might', 'enjoy', 'elements', 'stereotypical', 'teenage', 'soap', 'drama', 'anime', 'know', 'are', 'lot', 'fans', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'intellectually', 'emotionally']",Blood +: Part One

1129933,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B001152THA,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[50, 56]","Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy mysterious people, or as bloodthirsty monsters. In ""Blood+,"" you get two for the price of one.While this is technically a spinoff of ""Blood: The Last Vampire,"" this series stands easily on its own -- gallons of gore, taut action scenes, mystery, and a young vampire finding out the truth about the past she can't remember. And this boxed set -- containing the first half of the series -- is definitely worth getting.Saya Otonashi is anemic, and she doesn't remember anything about her life before she was adopted by a kindly veteran, George, and his sons Kai and Riku. Other than that, she's a perfectly normal Okinawa schoolgirl. Then a monster -- a vampiric Chiropteran -- attacks her at her high school. She's saved by the mysterious Haji, who forces her to drink a little of his blood.She destroys the monster in a matter of seconds -- unaware that her punky, overprotective brother Kai also saw the monster. And Saya's confusion only grows when she finds that George is discussing her mysterious past with a man named David, who is from a secret Chiropteran-fighting organization called Red Shield. When Saya's father is attacked and kidnapped, she, Kai and Haji all join the rescue effort.And afterwards, they become a part of Red Shield, though Saya doesn't know why she is so vital to their mission. Her fight takes her across Vietnam and Russia, through bloodied jungles and Siberian wastelands -- and her own half-forgotten memories -- as David tries to track down a train car with someone called ""Diva"" inside. But then Saya is told the truth about her own nature -- and her relationship to the cruel Chiropteran queen, Diva....While the original movie focused mainly on action, ""Blood+"" is more densely plotted, and more mysterious in its story. Primarily it's a horror/coming-of-age tale (with a bit of a love triangle), but there are also traces of mystery, comedy, horror and tragedy woven in here.In fact, the writers juggle multiple storylines (including one about a reporter and a schoolgirl) with ease. They also spun up a rich, complex vampire mythology, with multiple vampire breeds -- the horrific bloodthirsty fiends, the sexy Chevaliers like Haji and Solomon, and the cruel, childish Diva. There's also the Schiff, hooded half-vampires who show up long enough to give Haji some new punctures, but don't yet have much effect on the storyline.The animation is another exquisite part of the story -- detailed, realistic, and a bit gothic with all the shadows, pale light and old-world buildings. And there are some beautiful, striking images, like glowing blue roses, Saya's sword, and chateau ruins. But for all its beauty, ""Blood+"" is crammed with violence -- dismemberment, ripped-off faces, and buckets of blood from vampires and humans alike.Saya can be a bit whiny, but her terror and confusion gradually iron out into a likable, somewhat tragic heroine. Haji takes awhile to be fleshed out, but he's a tragic, adoring character when he is, especially in the long flashbacks to his childhood and travels with Saya. And Crispin Freeman's vocals don't hurt the effect.Kai is a particularly likable character, just because he's so normal -- an ordinary kid who is in over his head, and just trying to protect those he loves. All the supporting characters -- Riku, Julia, David and the cherubic Lewis -- are well-written. Even minor characters get plenty of detail, such as the Schiff and Diva's Chevaliers (particularly Solomon and the increasingly loopy Carl).""Blood+: Part One"" is a violent, bittersweet start to a brilliant series, as well as a great spin on typical vampire stories. It'll also leave you desperately wanting to know what happens next.",4,Nankurunaisa,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,3717,"['Vampires', 'are', 'usually', 'portrayed', 'sexy', 'mysterious', 'people', 'bloodthirsty', 'monsters', 'Blood+', 'get', 'two', 'price', 'one.While', 'technically', 'spinoff', 'Blood', 'Last', 'Vampire', 'series', 'easily', 'own', 'gallons', 'gore', 'taut', 'action', 'scenes', 'mystery', 'young', 'vampire', 'finding', 'out', 'truth', 'past', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'boxed', 'set', 'containing', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'definitely', 'worth', 'getting.Saya', 'Otonashi', 'anemic', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'life', 'was', 'adopted', 'kindly', 'veteran', 'George', 'sons', 'Kai', 'Riku', 'Other', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'Okinawa', 'schoolgirl', 'Then', 'monster', 'vampiric', 'Chiropteran', 'high', 'school', 'saved', 'mysterious', 'Haji', 'who', 'drink', 'little', 'blood.She', 'monster', 'matter', 'seconds', 'unaware', 'punky', 'overprotective', 'brother', 'Kai', 'also', 'saw', 'monster', 'Saya', 'confusion', 'only', 'when', 'George', 'discussing', 'mysterious', 'past', 'man', 'named', 'David', 'who', 'secret', 'Chiropteran-fighting', 'organization', 'called', 'Red', 'Shield', 'When', 'Saya', 'father', 'attacked', 'kidnapped', 'Kai', 'Haji', 'join', 'rescue', 'effort.And', 'afterwards', 'become', 'part', 'Red', 'Shield', 'Saya', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'so', 'vital', 'mission', 'fight', 'across', 'Vietnam', 'Russia', 'bloodied', 'jungles', 'Siberian', 'wastelands', 'own', 'half-forgotten', 'memories', 'David', 'track', 'down', 'train', 'car', 'someone', 'called', 'Diva', 'inside', 'then', 'Saya', 'told', 'truth', 'own', 'nature', 'relationship', 'cruel', 'Chiropteran', 'queen', 'Diva', '.While', 'original', 'movie', 'focused', 'mainly', 'action', 'Blood+', 'more', 'densely', 'plotted', 'more', 'mysterious', 'story', 'Primarily', 'horror/coming-of-age', 'tale', 'bit', 'love', 'triangle', 'are', 'also', 'traces', 'mystery', 'comedy', 'horror', 'tragedy', 'woven', 'here.In', 'fact', 'writers', 'juggle', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'including', 'one', 'reporter', 'schoolgirl', 'ease', 'also', 'spun', 'up', 'rich', 'complex', 'vampire', 'mythology', 'multiple', 'vampire', 'breeds', 'horrific', 'bloodthirsty', 'fiends', 'sexy', 'Chevaliers', 'Haji', 'Solomon', 'cruel', 'childish', 'Diva', 'also', 'Schiff', 'hooded', 'half-vampires', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'long', 'enough', 'give', 'Haji', 'new', 'punctures', 'do', ""n't"", 'yet', 'have', 'much', 'effect', 'storyline.The', 'animation', 'exquisite', 'part', 'story', 'detailed', 'realistic', 'bit', 'gothic', 'shadows', 'pale', 'light', 'old-world', 'buildings', 'are', 'beautiful', 'striking', 'images', 'glowing', 'blue', 'roses', 'Saya', 'sword', 'chateau', 'ruins', 'beauty', 'Blood+', 'crammed', 'violence', 'dismemberment', 'ripped-off', 'buckets', 'blood', 'vampires', 'humans', 'alike.Saya', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'whiny', 'terror', 'confusion', 'gradually', 'out', 'likable', 'somewhat', 'tragic', 'heroine', 'Haji', 'awhile', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'tragic', 'adoring', 'character', 'when', 'especially', 'long', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'travels', 'Saya', 'Crispin', 'Freeman', 'vocals', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'effect.Kai', 'particularly', 'likable', 'character', 'just', 'so', 'normal', 'ordinary', 'kid', 'who', 'head', 'just', 'trying', 'protect', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Riku', 'Julia', 'David', 'cherubic', 'Lewis', 'are', 'well-written', 'Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'get', 'plenty', 'detail', 'such', 'Schiff', 'Diva', 'Chevaliers', 'particularly', 'Solomon', 'increasingly', 'loopy', 'Carl', 'Blood+', 'Part', 'One', 'violent', 'bittersweet', 'start', 'brilliant', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'spin', 'typical', 'vampire', 'stories', ""'ll"", 'also', 'leave', 'desperately', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'next']",Blood +: Part One

I heard about this series and scheduled the episodes from Adult Swim on my Tivo.While thematically it is a bit ""lighter"" in mood than the original 2001 film, it is nevertheless a very original story (and sequel) about a girl who discovers her legacy: she is the ancient progenitor of a race of bloodthirsty vampires. These vampires are classified into greater (can mask their appearance as humans) and lesser (more beast-like). The pacing is excellent, at points it is very much a character driven show, lots of plot twists and surprises. In terms of quality, the dub is good and the animation is top notch. Characterization is much more developed and richer than alot of anime's on the market. The particular rivalry and juxtaposition between Jaya and Diva is particularly memorable, the finale is not to be missed.Overall, I think this is a worthy successor to the original movie Blood: the Last Vampire.  One drawback is the price: over $100 for part one only. Dunno when part Two is coming out, but Im hoping to buy these sometime soon (I missed several episodes on TV when it ran).

1129936,AMYSV3PZLNDCS,B001152THA,Just some old guy.,"[0, 0]","Like I said...this is ""Part 1""... Part two is coming Oct 20th.. ^_^ So when it comes to ending...do not expect one because this is a 50 episode series.So many people are better at reviewing than I am because I am not going to tell you the whole story in a review...I hate that. Which would explain why I am ranked like 5,608,144th as reviewers go..^_^Saya is the only sword wielding Vampire alive that is capable of killing these Chiropterans&lt;-spelling? Her blood is poison to them. To start with Saya seems to be a normal teenager except that one year prior to when this story takes off...she has no memory of who she is or what she is for that fact. Suddenly Says is attacked and she has no idea why is this thing after her (enter Haji). Saya begins to remember bits of her past and keeps asking her servant (Haji) to tell her everything but he just tells her that she must remember on her own..or it is not his place, which adds to the mystery. Being a normal teenager with two brothers and a father it is hard for her to accept that she is such a vicious killer. As Saya tries to piece together her past the journey takes her to numerous places. Vietnam, Russia, France and everywhere Saya goes there is trouble due to the fact there are those who just wish to kill her. There are others (the Schiff) who believe Saya's blood will be the cure to their curse, which means they are trying to kill her as well. Then there is another in the enemy's ranks who belives Saya can be brought into there line of thinking. In other words there are several players in this story and it is not limited to just kill..kill...kill.Saya is afraid to fight...afraid to run yet she does not want the people around her to die.....what to do?Yes there plenty of gore and although the amount of blood coming out can be a bit over the top it does not lessen the story. If you are looking for an interesting story that provides numerous enjoyable chracters then you should like this.I liked this a lot and even though it left me hanging...I have seen it 3 times and not because I did not get it the first time but because I am a single guy that has no life...hehehe. So in my feeble mind it has good replay value because the story is rather in depth.These are not stand alone episodes so it plays well from start to finish.I can not tell if you will like it but I can tell you the type of series that I like..Trinity Blood..Black Blood Brothers..Death Note..Hellsing..Last Exile. If you liked those then you might find this worth watching.I just wish it was not in Full Screen but the thinpaks are awesome.

1129941,A1ZYVEUW5ABDTB,B001152THA,qtvxzplr,"[9, 9]","*Warning-This Review Contains Spoilers*Blood+ avoids the problems many anime series have by having a plot that is intriguing and characters that develop through the series and who you genuinely care about.  It also actually has a good ending!  If you watch a lot of anime, you know how many series do not have satisfying endings.  The characters in Blood+ do not seem like the hundredth version of a stock character from other series; they're unique and complex.  The animation is beautiful and so is the music composed by Hans Zimmer.  There are also 4 opening and 4 closing theme songs for this series and they're all great; I think you only get to number 2 in this set. This show was always shown with a graphic violence warning on Adult Swim, and when there are battles, they are pretty bloody but not gratuitous.  Occasionally, the plot did slow up a little too much for me just when it seemed like something really big was going to happen between Saya and Diva, but I only minded because I was so into the story.  The most special thing about this show to me was the relationship between Saya and her adopted family and between her and Hagi.  This is one of the most moving anime series I've ever seen.  Saya goes through some of the hardest things that happen in real life, like losing a parent and sibling and feeling great remorse for something terrible that you've done in the past, then struggling with guilt and indecision.  The way these events were depicted was sometimes heartbreaking. These were real things that I could relate to and lift Blood+ far above a lot of other anime.About the set itself:  I prefer dub to sub, but because I love this series so much, I did want to watch it in Japanese with an accurate translation, so was disappointed like other reviewers in the ""dubtitles.""  I also didn't like that you can't get the subtitles OFF of the theme songs.  I find them irritating as they obstruct the animation, which is why I prefer dubbing in the first place.  I usually switch the subtitles to Korean because it blends in better.  The box comes with a T-shirt and a manga sampler; if you remove these, as I would like to, it makes the box too big for the DVDs and they rattle around.  The bonus disc of interviews with the Japanese voice cast was more interesting than I usually find these features to be.",5,"Not Only Great Anime, But A Great Story",1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,2333,"['*Warning-This', 'Review', 'Contains', 'Spoilers*Blood+', 'problems', 'many', 'anime', 'series', 'have', 'having', 'plot', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'develop', 'series', 'who', 'genuinely', 'care', 'also', 'actually', 'good', 'ending', 'watch', 'lot', 'anime', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'satisfying', 'endings', 'characters', 'Blood+', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'hundredth', 'version', 'stock', 'character', 'other', 'series', ""'re"", 'unique', 'complex', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'so', 'music', 'composed', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'are', 'also', '4', 'opening', '4', 'closing', 'theme', 'songs', 'series', ""'re"", 'great', 'think', 'only', 'get', 'number', '2', 'set', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'shown', 'graphic', 'violence', 'warning', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'when', 'are', 'battles', 'are', 'pretty', 'bloody', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'Occasionally', 'plot', 'did', 'slow', 'up', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'when', 'seemed', 'something', 'really', 'big', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'Saya', 'Diva', 'only', 'minded', 'was', 'so', 'story', 'most', 'special', 'thing', 'show', 'was', 'relationship', 'Saya', 'adopted', 'family', 'Hagi', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'anime', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Saya', 'hardest', 'things', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'losing', 'parent', 'sibling', 'feeling', 'great', 'remorse', 'something', 'terrible', ""'ve"", 'done', 'past', 'then', 'struggling', 'guilt', 'indecision', 'way', 'events', 'were', 'depicted', 'was', 'sometimes', 'heartbreaking', 'were', 'real', 'things', 'could', 'relate', 'lift', 'Blood+', 'far', 'lot', 'other', 'set', 'prefer', 'dub', 'sub', 'love', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'did', 'want', 'watch', 'Japanese', 'accurate', 'translation', 'so', 'was', 'disappointed', 'other', 'reviewers', 'dubtitles', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'subtitles', 'OFF', 'theme', 'songs', 'find', 'irritating', 'obstruct', 'animation', 'why', 'prefer', 'dubbing', 'first', 'place', 'usually', 'switch', 'subtitles', 'Korean', 'better', 'box', 'T-shirt', 'manga', 'sampler', 'remove', 'would', 'like', 'box', 'too', 'big', 'DVDs', 'rattle', 'around', 'bonus', 'disc', 'interviews', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'cast', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'usually', 'find', 'features', 'be']",Blood +: Part One

I went back and bought the OEM produced product thru Amazon the fall of 2009 to add to my collection, cause I like it so much. Buy the original Sony product dubbed correctly unless your going to watch in original Japanese speak. They aren't cheap, but if your a true connesuir of top notch anime this set is on the must have list. These are very good anime, gets a little bogged down in the later half but does finish well, leaving you wanting more of these characters.

1129944,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B001152THA,Tim Janson,"[4, 4]","Blood+ is a sequel to the 2001 Anime Film, Blood: The Last Vampire.  The series premiered in Japan in 2005 and then in the U.S. as part of the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim group in 2007.  The opening prologue is set during the Vietnam War as a young woman goes on a maniacal killing spree, killing monsters as well as innocent civilians and soldier.  Now cut ahead to Okinawa in 2005, that young woman, Saya, has been adopted by a former American Soldier, George, who runs a pub in Okinawa.  Kai has two brothers, also adopted by George, Kai, the older brother and Riku, the youngest of the children.Saya has been living with George and her brothers for the past year but has no memory of anything before that.  Saya's peaceful life with her family is changed for ever when a horrific beast attacks her one evening in her high school.  A mysterious man intervenes, giving Saya a sword.  Saya cuts herself, allowing her blood to flow into grooves on the sword, and with a skill that she didn't realize she had, slays the beast.  The monster is a Chiroptean, giant, bat-like creatures possessing great strength, speed and almost total invulnerability.  They live on the blood of humans although they are not vampires in the traditional sense.  The only thing that can kill the Chiropteans is Saya's blood.It's difficult summarizing Blood+ because there numerous sub-plots and a large roster of characters.  Saya's mysterious protector is her servant Haji, but she's also protected by a secret organization called ""Red Shield"" dedicated to destroying the Chiropteans.  In the first few episodes we'll learn part of Saya's background and how she came to be adopted by George.  Blood+ however, spoon feeds its mysteries.  We learn something new about Saya or the other characters in nearly every episode but the show's pacing is very deliberate.The character development is among the very best I've ever seen in any Anime.  You get to know all of the characters and their personalities and it's hard not to develop an attachment to them.  Saya is not a gung-ho stereotypical heroine.  At times she's so reluctant to fight that it's frustrating.  Even when friends and family are in peril she has difficulty early on coming to grips with what she is and her abilities.  And just WHAT is Saya?  I'll not play spoiler and that's one of the mysteries that takes a while to be fully revealed.  Her reluctance to fight however does allow other characters such as Haji and Red Shield's Mr. David to shine with their own skills.Blood+ has a different look than traditional Anime.  Combining traditional cell animation with CGI, it has a darker and grittier tone but also a fluidity that cell animation lacks.  At times it gives the look an almost dream-like quality.  The Chiropteans are often cloaked in shadows with just their blood-red eyes visible.  This is a bloody, often brutal series that pulls no punches.You'll note that I listed the cast with the American voice actors.  This is because I watched the English audio as opposed to the Japanese audio.  I realize that this is sacrilege to Anime purists but when you're watching a DVD for the purpose to review it, and take notes, it's difficult to try and follow sub-titles as well.  The American voice actors are all extremely experience and have numerous Anime credits.The boxed set includes the first 25 episodes of the series on five discs with the sixth disc featuring bonus material included extensive interviews.  The set also includes a Manga sampler booklet and an exclusive Blood+ T-shirt.I can't claim to be an Anime fanatic or expert but Blood+ drew me into its world unlike any other series and it's one of the best I've seen.",5,ATMOSPERIC AND FUN,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,3684,"['Blood+', 'sequel', '2001', 'Anime', 'Film', 'Blood', 'Last', 'Vampire', 'series', 'premiered', 'Japan', '2005', 'then', 'U.S.', 'part', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'group', '2007', 'opening', 'prologue', 'set', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'young', 'woman', 'maniacal', 'killing', 'spree', 'killing', 'monsters', 'as', 'well', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'soldier', 'Now', 'ahead', 'Okinawa', '2005', 'young', 'woman', 'Saya', 'been', 'adopted', 'former', 'American', 'Soldier', 'George', 'who', 'pub', 'Okinawa', 'Kai', 'two', 'brothers', 'also', 'adopted', 'George', 'Kai', 'older', 'brother', 'Riku', 'youngest', 'children.Saya', 'been', 'living', 'George', 'brothers', 'past', 'year', 'memory', 'anything', 'Saya', 'peaceful', 'life', 'family', 'changed', 'ever', 'when', 'horrific', 'beast', 'one', 'evening', 'high', 'school', 'mysterious', 'man', 'intervenes', 'giving', 'Saya', 'sword', 'Saya', 'allowing', 'blood', 'flow', 'grooves', 'sword', 'skill', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'had', 'beast', 'monster', 'Chiroptean', 'giant', 'bat-like', 'creatures', 'possessing', 'great', 'strength', 'speed', 'almost', 'total', 'invulnerability', 'live', 'blood', 'humans', 'are', 'not', 'vampires', 'traditional', 'sense', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'kill', 'Chiropteans', 'Saya', 'blood.It', 'difficult', 'summarizing', 'Blood+', 'numerous', 'sub-plots', 'large', 'roster', 'characters', 'Saya', 'mysterious', 'protector', 'servant', 'Haji', 'also', 'protected', 'secret', 'organization', 'called', 'Red', 'Shield', 'dedicated', 'destroying', 'Chiropteans', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'part', 'Saya', 'background', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'adopted', 'George', 'Blood+', 'however', 'spoon', 'feeds', 'mysteries', 'learn', 'something', 'new', 'Saya', 'other', 'characters', 'nearly', 'episode', 'show', 'pacing', 'very', 'deliberate.The', 'character', 'development', 'very', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Anime', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'personalities', 'hard', 'not', 'develop', 'attachment', 'Saya', 'not', 'gung-ho', 'stereotypical', 'heroine', 'times', 'so', 'reluctant', 'fight', 'frustrating', 'Even', 'when', 'friends', 'family', 'are', 'peril', 'difficulty', 'early', 'coming', 'grips', 'what', 'abilities', 'just', 'WHAT', 'Saya', ""'ll"", 'not', 'play', 'spoiler', 'one', 'mysteries', 'while', 'be', 'fully', 'revealed', 'reluctance', 'fight', 'however', 'allow', 'other', 'characters', 'such', 'Haji', 'Red', 'Shield', 'Mr.', 'David', 'shine', 'own', 'skills.Blood+', 'different', 'look', 'traditional', 'Anime', 'Combining', 'traditional', 'cell', 'animation', 'CGI', 'darker', 'grittier', 'tone', 'also', 'fluidity', 'cell', 'animation', 'times', 'look', 'almost', 'dream-like', 'quality', 'Chiropteans', 'are', 'often', 'cloaked', 'shadows', 'just', 'blood-red', 'eyes', 'visible', 'bloody', 'often', 'brutal', 'series', 'punches.You', ""'ll"", 'note', 'listed', 'cast', 'American', 'voice', 'actors', 'watched', 'English', 'audio', 'opposed', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'realize', 'sacrilege', 'Anime', 'purists', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'DVD', 'purpose', 'review', 'take', 'notes', 'difficult', 'try', 'follow', 'sub-titles', 'well', 'American', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'extremely', 'experience', 'have', 'numerous', 'Anime', 'credits.The', 'boxed', 'set', 'first', '25', 'episodes', 'series', 'five', 'discs', 'sixth', 'disc', 'featuring', 'material', 'included', 'extensive', 'interviews', 'set', 'also', 'Manga', 'sampler', 'booklet', 'exclusive', 'Blood+', 'T-shirt.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'claim', 'be', 'Anime', 'fanatic', 'expert', 'Blood+', 'drew', 'world', 'other', 'series', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen']",Blood +: Part One
