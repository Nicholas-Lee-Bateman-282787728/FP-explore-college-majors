Pacino and Mirren were outstanding in their portrayals of the principals, but the program wasn't long enough or deep enough to really show how these people got to where they were. The dissection of Phil Spector's character was interesting, but who was Linda Kenney-Baden that she was sought out for her contribution to his defense? And who was Lana Clarkson and how did she end up dead in that mansion? Helen Mirren can do just about anything on stage or screen, including look frumpy and deathly ill without self-consciousness. I liked her performance, but it was basically limited to the immediacy of that investigation and trial, and I would've preferred more.

1655553,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00DGCIZD8,J from NY,"[13, 29]","One review of this film on the web called it a ""guilty pleasure"" for HBO fans.  A guilty pleasure, indeed.David Mamet has written some interesting screenplays (""The Untouchables"", ""Hoffa"") but I can't help but wonder just what he was up to here.  Phil Spector, producer of some great music, was obviously pretty disturbed throughout his whole life.  Joey Ramone once told Rolling Stone that Spector told him: ""I'm worried about going to Hell, because I'd be worse than the Devil.""  Ramone also told that same magazine that he had once put a gun to the singer's head, demanding a blowjob.  Actually he'd done this six or seven times throughout his life--mostly to women, though.  Spector was an angry recluse who could never stay close to anyone in his life because of his grievous mental illness, drug addictions, and huge ego.  The reason he killed Lana Clarkson is because she didn't recognize him when he went to the House of Blues and she was a waitress.  An actress who never quite made  it, she had bit roles in films like Scarface.  To Mamet, who has always espoused a philosophy of ""the free market"" and called none other than Thomas Sowell one of the ""greatest minds of our time"", this makes her irrelevant.  A musical genius can kill a less talented person because that less talented person just isn't as important, after all.All we see in Mamet's ""film"" is a kindly eccentric who feels left behind by time.  I'm kinda surprised Pacino took this role, but the only thing more comical than this desperate grab for attention is the wig that hangs on his head.  (You see, Phil Spector wore that to his trial in order to imitate Jimi Hendrix and his protest of government surveillance.  So, who really cares if he shot a woman in the mouth?)None other than mob lawyer scumbag Bruce Cutler is even given a friendly treatment in this movie, though I must say Jeffrey Tampor's bit performance as John Gotti's alter ego is better than Helen Mirren's, who is barely acting, really.  She's just there for screen time with Pacino.Mamet engages in some speculative nonsense about how because Spector was three feet away from Clarkson, well, he couldn't have shot her according to the laws of physics.  That night he stumbled out of his house with Lana Clarkson's blood all over his shirt and told his driver, ""I think I just killed somebody.""  This guy is guiltier than Robert Blake.I wouldn't be surprised if Mamet had Spector himself write some of this garbage from prison.  The true implication of the film is that Lana Clarkson doesn't matter, in the end.  All that matters is that the goof with the wig on was there when John Lennon wrote his song ""Imagine"".  This disgusted me, particularly considering the caliber of the actors and actresses involved.",1,A vomit worthy Hollywood whitewash,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,2756,"['One', 'review', 'film', 'web', 'called', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'HBO', 'fans', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'indeed.David', 'Mamet', 'written', 'interesting', 'screenplays', 'Untouchables', 'Hoffa', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'here', 'Phil', 'Spector', 'producer', 'great', 'music', 'was', 'obviously', 'pretty', 'disturbed', 'whole', 'life', 'Joey', 'Ramone', 'once', 'told', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'Spector', 'told', ""'m"", 'worried', 'going', 'Hell', ""'d"", 'be', 'worse', 'Devil', 'Ramone', 'also', 'told', 'same', 'magazine', 'had', 'once', 'put', 'gun', 'singer', 'head', 'demanding', 'blowjob', 'Actually', ""'d"", 'done', 'six', 'seven', 'times', 'life', 'mostly', 'women', 'though', 'Spector', 'was', 'angry', 'recluse', 'who', 'could', 'never', 'stay', 'close', 'anyone', 'life', 'grievous', 'mental', 'illness', 'drug', 'addictions', 'huge', 'ego', 'reason', 'killed', 'Lana', 'Clarkson', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'when', 'went', 'House', 'Blues', 'was', 'waitress', 'actress', 'who', 'never', 'quite', 'made', 'had', 'bit', 'roles', 'films', 'Scarface', 'Mamet', 'who', 'always', 'espoused', 'philosophy', 'free', 'market', 'called', 'none', 'other', 'Thomas', 'Sowell', 'one', 'greatest', 'minds', 'time', 'irrelevant', 'musical', 'genius', 'can', 'kill', 'less', 'talented', 'person', 'less', 'talented', 'person', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', 'all.All', 'see', 'Mamet', 'film', 'kindly', 'eccentric', 'who', 'left', 'time', ""'m"", 'kinda', 'surprised', 'Pacino', 'took', 'role', 'only', 'thing', 'more', 'comical', 'desperate', 'grab', 'attention', 'wig', 'head', 'see', 'Phil', 'Spector', 'wore', 'trial', 'order', 'imitate', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'protest', 'government', 'surveillance', 'So', 'who', 'really', 'shot', 'woman', 'mouth', 'None', 'other', 'mob', 'lawyer', 'scumbag', 'Bruce', 'Cutler', 'even', 'given', 'friendly', 'treatment', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'Jeffrey', 'Tampor', 'bit', 'performance', 'John', 'Gotti', 'alter', 'ego', 'better', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'who', 'barely', 'acting', 'really', 'just', 'there', 'screen', 'time', 'Pacino.Mamet', 'engages', 'speculative', 'nonsense', 'how', 'because', 'Spector', 'was', 'three', 'feet', 'away', 'Clarkson', 'well', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'shot', 'according', 'laws', 'physics', 'night', 'stumbled', 'out', 'house', 'Lana', 'Clarkson', 'blood', 'shirt', 'told', 'driver', 'think', 'just', 'killed', 'somebody', 'guy', 'guiltier', 'Robert', 'Blake.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Mamet', 'had', 'Spector', 'write', 'garbage', 'prison', 'true', 'implication', 'film', 'Lana', 'Clarkson', ""n't"", 'matter', 'end', 'matters', 'goof', 'wig', 'was', 'when', 'John', 'Lennon', 'wrote', 'song', 'Imagine', 'disgusted', 'particularly', 'considering', 'caliber', 'actors', 'actresses', 'involved']",Phil Spector

1655555,A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M,B00DGCIZD8,Kevin Currie-Knight,"[2, 2]","I have always been a huge David Mamet fan but, to be honest, his films of the last several years have left a bit to be desired. (The  dialogue and scripts were too choppy; the plots, a bit weak.) Here, though, we have a Mamet film that really has Mamet doing what he does best - creating really good, forward-moving dialogue around a really intriguing plot.The plot centers around the first murder trial of Phil Spector, seen through the eyes of Spector's defense team. This intriguing angle is largely responsible for the film's uniqueness. Helen Mirren does a fantastic job as the lead defense lawyer who, at first, does not want to take the case, but gradually sympathizes with Spector and fears that without a good defense, a jury might convict him for his eccentricities alone. She and her defense team are determined not to see that happen, so they develop a defense not only based on (their interpretation of) the facts, but allowing the jury to learn about the human side of Spector. The question up until the very end of the film: put the unpredictable Phil Spector (played by an impeccable Al Pacino) on the stand?I found the film quite riveting. Mamet creates a forceful forward motion with his rapid-fire dialogue punctuated by emotion-filled monologues (usually by Spector). The plot is both an interesting who-dunnit as well as a psychological exploration of Spector. All in all, a really good film that (at least to me) finds Mamet recapturing some of that &#34;Glengary Glenn Ross&#34; magic.",5,An Interesting Look at The People v.

1655556,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00DGCIZD8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","The fascinating HBO production ""Phil Spector"" was one of the season's most pleasant surprises in my estimation, but it might not be exactly what you are anticipating. If you are looking for a traditional legal picture about Spector's alleged crime and subsequent trial, this might not fulfill your requirements. If you are looking for a standard biopic detailing Spector's life up to and including his current incarceration, that's not to be found here either. Playwright David Mamet, the writer and director of ""Phil Spector,"" does not seem particularly interested in recreating the Spector spectacle. Instead, he uses it as a speculative entertainment, a what-if scenario. A disclaimer at the beginning of the film says that this has no real basis in actual circumstances, but was instead merely inspired by the case. It's an interesting notion and one that is executed expertly. What we get unfolds very much like a play. Spector (Al Pacino) is confronted by a defense attorney (Helen Mirren) and the two share a heated discourse that contemplates the nature of celebrity, the media, and the legal system itself. Riveting, intellectual, and thought-provoking, Mamet's screenplay and the work of Pacino and Mirren make this incredibly unusual and slyly powerful.Is Spector guilty? Is he innocent? Although Mamet's personal opinions seem fairly obvious, it really doesn't matter in the context of ""Phil Spector."" Opinions have already been formed and the trial has already been pre-judged. The legal determination is secondary to the popular consensus. Whether or not the eccentric Spector can withstand additional scrutiny through the trial process is one of the largest plot points. Whatever the outcome, he can't possibly hope to escape the situation unscathed. There is not a substantial narrative to ""Phil Spector"" or even a concrete ending. It is just a momentary glimpse into the interaction of two people. When, however, they are played by heavyweights such as Mirren and Pacino, there is no tearing your eyes from the screen. Like a fine night in the theater, this film offers great performances, literate dialogue, and fascinating ideas. It is nothing like what I expected, but all the more profound for the surprise. Needless to say, it may not be for everyone for exactly these same reasons. I guarantee that some will see the lack of plotting or open-ended finale as crucial mistakes, but I loved this movie.The movie begins after the death of Lana Clarkson has transpired and Spector has already put Bruce Cutler (a fine Jeffrey Tambor) on the case. Cutler brings in legal consultant Linda Kenney Baden (Mirren) to offer assistance and perspective on what seems like a case that is all but open and shut. Initially disinterested (along with being quite sick), Mirren reluctantly agrees to a meet. The first time we see Pacino as Spector is when Mirren meets him on one dark and stormy night. As the night progresses, Mirren begins to understand and appreciate her client and determines a possible defense in the ballistic evidence. But can it be pulled off? A mock trial is set-up (with brief appearances by Chiwetel Ejiofor as the prosecutor and Mamet's real life wife Rebecca Pidgeon). Can physical evidence overcome prejudice? And is Spector his own worst enemy by not being able to temper his personality to acceptable expectations?Again, though, this is never really about a tangible story. It's about ideas and dialogue. Mirren is absolutely terrific. What would you expect? And Pacino is quite accomplished. I have been critical of some of Pacino's recent roles, he oftentimes seems to be playing to the rafters in roles that might benefit from some restraint. Here, though, Spector is larger than life. Pacino captures him perfectly. Oddly sympathetic and elaborately grandiose, this is a man that time has left behind. The two play off each other with precision. A definite recommendation.

1655557,A2JTK7ZFN02W9A,B00DGCIZD8,Mark S. Crawford,"[0, 2]","This movie starts with a disclaimer: ""This is a work of fiction. It's not 'based on a true story.' It is a drama inspired by actual persons in a trail, but it is neither an attempt to depict the actual persons, nor to comment upon the trail or it's outcome."" Having read this, and then watched the movie, I don't understand why the  ""true story"" and the ""actual persons"" were not deemed interesting enough to be the source. Why not just present the story as it was? Beyond that, the disclaimer seems contradictory. If it's not based on a true story, what is it based on?Throughout the movie, the Spector character bemoans the fact that he is being singled out because he was successful; that past great personalities were similarly persecuted because they were ""too big for their britches.""  In addition, his character proposes that there is no reportable news unless a person of character is perceived to deviate from their ""normal"" behavior. Whether or not the real Spector said this, the movie just proves this point; apparently, all of Spector's previous accomplishments were not enough to warrant a bio-pic, but the ""crash and burn"" moment of a successful--albeit eccentric--man, were.Motivation and necessity of this movie aside, I was somewhat surprised of the caliber of casting. Helen Mirren does a fine job of portraying Spector's attorney--though we may never really know what the real attorney's feelings and contributions were, as this film was a ""drama inspired by actual persons.""  Al Pacino (!) plays Spector. He does a good job of portraying an eccentric character, but I never got past that this was Al Pacino in essentially a made-for-TV movie.There's no suspense in this movie. It ends rather abruptly and then includes summative sentences to explain what happens after the events portrayed in the movie. This film did nothing to move me emotionally regarding Spector or Lana Clarkson.
