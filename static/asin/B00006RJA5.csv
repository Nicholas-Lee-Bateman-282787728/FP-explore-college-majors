I thought it was excellent then, and seeing these VHS tapes prompted me to buy the whole series this past summer from Amazon.com.  I particularly enjoyed the wholesome scenes of family life, not too different from Michael Landon's adaptation of Laura Ingalls Wilder's ""Little House on the Prairie"" TV series (1974-83).  The actors in ""The Valley Between"" are all excellent, and very believable in their roles, but I enjoyed especially the acting of Jamie Croft (age 15 in 1996 when this was made) who plays Bruno Gunter, a 14 year old boy living in a the country near a small village in eastern Australia in the 1930s.  His father, a stern German immigrant, insists on hard work and high moral values from his son.  Bruno is often day-dreaming, not attentive in school, preferring to be with his friends, or visitng with neighbors.  There are some comic elements, and some dramatic moments, too.  But although Bruno appears irresponsible and his father too stern and gruff at times, there is and understanding between them and a good personal chemistry.Most of the actors in the cast are Australians, and there are cast bios included on one of the DVDs.  Marcos Gunter, Bruno's father, is played by Christian Kohlund, who according to his bio is from Switzerland;  I've seen Kohlund in Canadian TV shows set in the 1800s, with a similar theme to ""The Valley Between.""[...]  The lack of extreme violence and foul language also makes this a desirable series for families: wholeome entertainment.  Highly recommended.",5,"Excellent, wholesome family entertainment",1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,1664,"['first', 'saw', 'episodes', '2', '3', 'Valley', 'Between', '2', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'Brittania', 'catalog', '1998', 'then', 'called', 'Life', 'Australian', 'Prairie', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'then', 'seeing', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'prompted', 'buy', 'whole', 'series', 'past', 'summer', 'Amazon.com', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'wholesome', 'scenes', 'family', 'life', 'not', 'too', 'different', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'adaptation', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'TV', 'series', '1974-83', 'actors', 'Valley', 'Between', 'are', 'excellent', 'very', 'believable', 'roles', 'enjoyed', 'especially', 'acting', 'Jamie', 'Croft', 'age', '15', '1996', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'who', 'Bruno', 'Gunter', '14', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'living', 'country', 'small', 'village', 'eastern', 'Australia', '1930s', 'father', 'stern', 'German', 'immigrant', 'hard', 'work', 'high', 'moral', 'values', 'son', 'Bruno', 'often', 'day-dreaming', 'not', 'attentive', 'school', 'preferring', 'be', 'friends', 'visitng', 'neighbors', 'are', 'comic', 'elements', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'too', 'Bruno', 'irresponsible', 'father', 'too', 'stern', 'gruff', 'times', 'understanding', 'good', 'personal', 'chemistry.Most', 'actors', 'cast', 'are', 'Australians', 'are', 'cast', 'bios', 'included', 'one', 'DVDs', 'Marcos', 'Gunter', 'Bruno', 'father', 'played', 'Christian', 'Kohlund', 'who', 'according', 'bio', 'Switzerland', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Kohlund', 'Canadian', 'TV', 'shows', 'set', '1800s', 'similar', 'theme', 'Valley', 'Between.', '[', 'lack', 'extreme', 'violence', 'foul', 'language', 'also', 'desirable', 'series', 'families', 'wholeome', 'entertainment', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

There is an impressive 10 hours of video episodes (most 45 minutes) as well as extras about Australia's history on this 2 DVD set. How many movie companies will give you five hours of video and audio material on one DVD. I love the acting of Jamie Croft as Bruno. You get a lot of enjoyment out of watching this 1930's movie about a boy growing up with his family in Australia. This film would be especially good if you have a back seat TV and DVD player in some van and you want to entertain the kids after logging many miles and hours of road time. I would give this movie ten stars if I could.

The acting is so good, the characters seem totally real,  and the storyline is gripping. Each of the 6 episodes builds on the previous ones, but is an entire story in itself. From a mischievious, prank-prone boy, we watch the development and growth of Bruno, the main caharcter, as he turns into a responsible, moral and hardworking young man, This is good old fashiioned family entertainment, the way old Disney pictures were.
