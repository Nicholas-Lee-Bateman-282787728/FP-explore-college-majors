1257879,AUSDYYGGX2FSG,B002A0KV6G,"Debra Mathis ""Movie Maven""","[5, 8]","Choking with laughter as I read all the other reviews here on this flick I wondered, gee, were we watching the same movie? Had I traveled to an alternate dimension? Come on now. If you're a guy between 18 and 34, you'll enjoy the booty shaking, brawls and bikinis - but there's not all that much of these scenes. However, ""The Bangkok Bad Guys"" have some fine cutlery. As far as the martial arts, no way is Bokeem as good as he wants to be, Rick certainly fulfilling that part nicely, and Dania? I just wanted to reach into the screen and smack her a couple of times - figuratively speaking, of course. I kept wondering, is it her or her character that felt like someone scratching fingernails on a blackboard...I wasn't impressed. No specific reasons - she didn't act well in this film, the voice over for her oh-so-fake concert was off track, her character actually made me angry a couple of times with the complaining, she's an acceptable singer - not a great one, and did I mention she was actorically challenged? (Yes I made that phrase up) Many scenes had clothing as the main character - for instance, Dania's undies had a great loooong shot, during a chase scene Bokeem's jacket would be around Dania's shoulders, then not, then back again, him finally removing it and re-placing it once more at a Buddhist temple. Yep, two professional assassins and a whining female stop to stroll leisurely through a temple. A big one. And the bad guys still lurking aren't considered, but Bokeem putting his jacket around Dania's shoulders again was. That jacket should have had a mention as a cast member. Oh well. Now the main bad guy, the one who was responsible for Rick and Bokeem's pseudo brotherhood? His acting? Oh, dear. His beard was a fairly good one though. Plus, I'm not going to even mention the actor's name who played Rick and Bokeem's father image - he's been in some fair to good movies in his time, even though he resembles Huggy Bear in the beginning of this movie. Maybe if I don't mention him, he'll not have been in this flick. Wow. I'm actually hoping I traveled to some other dimension and the reviews I read complimenting this flick so highly are from another place and time.I'll watch an old Chuck Norris flick from the 70's, turn off the sound, put on a current CD, and get a better movie experience than this. All I kept doing was checking to see HOW much LONGER it was GOING to TAKE before it was OVER. And please, when reading this, bear in mind I really love martial arts movies - and martial arts, for that matter. I was disappointed in this, though again, Rick was excellent in a couple of fight scenes. Rick led the pack as far as acting quality, and that meant someone with a can of hairspray, off camera, spritzing his eyes in order to make it look as though he was on the verge of crying.I bet I get cyber-throttled for this review - but it's my take, not everyone's. I always welcome other opinions. Not that my mind would be changed...I'd still recommend this; hey, wait for this one to hit the cable, folks. Be well - everyone.",2,Oh come on now.,1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,3063,"['Choking', 'laughter', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'flick', 'wondered', 'gee', 'were', 'watching', 'same', 'movie', 'Had', 'traveled', 'alternate', 'dimension', 'Come', 'now', ""'re"", 'guy', '18', '34', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'booty', 'shaking', 'brawls', 'bikinis', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'scenes', 'However', 'Bangkok', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'have', 'fine', 'cutlery', 'As', 'far', 'martial', 'arts', 'way', 'Bokeem', 'as', 'good', 'be', 'Rick', 'certainly', 'fulfilling', 'part', 'nicely', 'Dania', 'just', 'wanted', 'reach', 'screen', 'smack', 'couple', 'times', 'figuratively', 'speaking', 'course', 'kept', 'wondering', 'character', 'felt', 'someone', 'scratching', 'fingernails', 'blackboard', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'specific', 'reasons', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'well', 'film', 'voice', 'oh-so-fake', 'concert', 'was', 'track', 'character', 'actually', 'made', 'angry', 'couple', 'times', 'complaining', 'acceptable', 'singer', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'did', 'mention', 'was', 'actorically', 'challenged', 'Yes', 'made', 'phrase', 'up', 'Many', 'scenes', 'had', 'clothing', 'main', 'character', 'instance', 'Dania', 'undies', 'had', 'great', 'loooong', 'shot', 'chase', 'scene', 'Bokeem', 'jacket', 'would', 'be', 'Dania', 'shoulders', 'then', 'not', 'then', 'back', 'again', 'finally', 'removing', 're-placing', 'once', 'more', 'Buddhist', 'temple', 'Yep', 'two', 'professional', 'assassins', 'whining', 'female', 'stop', 'stroll', 'leisurely', 'temple', 'big', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'still', 'lurking', 'are', ""n't"", 'considered', 'Bokeem', 'putting', 'jacket', 'Dania', 'shoulders', 'again', 'was', 'jacket', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'mention', 'cast', 'member', 'Oh', 'well', 'Now', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'Rick', 'Bokeem', 'pseudo', 'brotherhood', 'acting', 'Oh', 'dear', 'beard', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'one', 'though', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'even', 'mention', 'actor', 'name', 'who', 'played', 'Rick', 'Bokeem', 'father', 'image', 'been', 'fair', 'good', 'movies', 'time', 'even', 'Huggy', 'Bear', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', ""'ll"", 'not', 'have', 'been', 'flick', 'Wow', ""'m"", 'actually', 'hoping', 'traveled', 'other', 'dimension', 'reviews', 'read', 'complimenting', 'flick', 'so', 'highly', 'are', 'place', 'time.I', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'old', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'flick', '70', 'turn', 'off', 'sound', 'put', 'current', 'CD', 'get', 'better', 'movie', 'experience', 'kept', 'doing', 'was', 'checking', 'see', 'HOW', 'much', 'LONGER', 'was', 'GOING', 'TAKE', 'was', 'OVER', 'please', 'when', 'reading', 'bear', 'mind', 'really', 'love', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'martial', 'arts', 'matter', 'was', 'disappointed', 'though', 'again', 'Rick', 'was', 'excellent', 'couple', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Rick', 'led', 'pack', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'quality', 'meant', 'someone', 'can', 'hairspray', 'off', 'camera', 'spritzing', 'eyes', 'order', 'make', 'look', 'was', 'verge', 'crying.I', 'bet', 'get', 'cyber-throttled', 'review', 'take', 'not', 'everyone', 'always', 'welcome', 'other', 'opinions', 'Not', 'mind', 'would', 'be', 'changed', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'hey', 'wait', 'one', 'hit', 'cable', 'folks', 'Be', 'well', 'everyone']",The Fifth Commandment

So why the 4 stars?I watched the special features.On the evidence from this film, Rick Yune is not a talented actor, nor a talented martial artist. However, he has real heart! You should hear him talk about his passion for creating this film, for driving everything forward in the face of adversity, for wanting to produce something that his friends could be proud of. And not least, for wanting to create an experience that would touch people. (Sentiments echoed by director Jesse Jackson.)Sadly, the film simply doesn't live up to that. But when you've heard his words, it's impossible to look at the film in the same light. For instance, there's a car chase. A very forgetable car chase. Nothing at all that would make you tell your friends that they just had to see it. Nothing about it would even be worthy of mentioning! So why do I mention it? Because it's only in the interview section you learn of the production problems they had which led to the car chase being filmed in the way it was.That explosion in the intro which looks like over-the-top CGI - watch it, listen to the interview, and then judge it!My greatest disappointment was in the martial arts department. Or, to be specific - the lack of such. With mentions of Ong Bak on the cover, I was expecting something..., well, just something. There's VERY little. And what there is, isn't filmed/edited well at all. It's very difficult to follow the action, which watching martial arts is all about. There's a half decent fight at the end, but really, the rest is mainly just shooting, but with the odd angle of an elbow strike, cut to a backfist, cut to... YOu know what I mean.Again, the interviews - they purposefully tried to film in a different way to please both Asian and Western audiences - sadly it didn't work!The fighting itself - again they tried to portray a different style of combat that hadn't been seen before. Sadly, maybe the reason it hadn't been seen is that it simply isn't that thrilling, that cinematic. Or simply that they choreographed/filmed it badly. Who knows.However, now I know what they were trying to do, I have a greater appreciation of the final results.I will watch this film again, but this time with a greater appreciation.So, the film gets 2 stars for content, 1 star for passion, 1 star for trying to be inventive against the odds.",4,Poor film that redeems itself,1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,2435,"['watching', 'was', 'going', 'never', 'even', 'look', 'again', 'give', 'only', '2', 'stars', 'review', 'So', 'why', '4', 'stars', 'watched', 'special', 'features.On', 'evidence', 'film', 'Rick', 'Yune', 'not', 'talented', 'actor', 'talented', 'martial', 'artist', 'However', 'real', 'heart', 'should', 'hear', 'talk', 'passion', 'creating', 'film', 'driving', 'everything', 'forward', 'face', 'adversity', 'wanting', 'produce', 'something', 'friends', 'could', 'be', 'proud', 'not', 'least', 'wanting', 'create', 'experience', 'would', 'touch', 'people', 'Sentiments', 'echoed', 'director', 'Jesse', 'Jackson', 'Sadly', 'film', 'simply', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'when', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'words', 'impossible', 'look', 'film', 'same', 'light', 'instance', 'car', 'chase', 'very', 'forgetable', 'car', 'chase', 'Nothing', 'would', 'make', 'tell', 'friends', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'Nothing', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'worthy', 'mentioning', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'mention', 'only', 'interview', 'section', 'learn', 'production', 'problems', 'had', 'led', 'car', 'chase', 'being', 'filmed', 'way', 'explosion', 'intro', 'over-the-top', 'CGI', 'watch', 'interview', 'then', 'judge', 'My', 'greatest', 'disappointment', 'was', 'martial', 'arts', 'department', 'be', 'specific', 'lack', 'such', 'mentions', 'Ong', 'Bak', 'cover', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'well', 'just', 'something', 'VERY', 'little', 'what', ""n't"", 'filmed/edited', 'well', 'very', 'difficult', 'follow', 'action', 'watching', 'martial', 'arts', 'about', 'half', 'decent', 'fight', 'end', 'really', 'rest', 'mainly', 'just', 'shooting', 'odd', 'angle', 'elbow', 'strike', 'cut', 'backfist', 'cut', 'YOu', 'know', 'what', 'mean.Again', 'interviews', 'purposefully', 'tried', 'film', 'different', 'way', 'please', 'Asian', 'Western', 'audiences', 'sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'fighting', 'again', 'tried', 'portray', 'different', 'style', 'combat', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'Sadly', 'maybe', 'reason', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'simply', ""n't"", 'thrilling', 'cinematic', 'simply', 'choreographed/filmed', 'badly', 'Who', 'knows.However', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'have', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'final', 'results.I', 'will', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'time', 'greater', 'appreciation.So', 'film', '2', 'stars', 'content', '1', 'star', 'passion', '1', 'star', 'trying', 'be', 'inventive', 'odds']",The Fifth Commandment

Sucks for THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT that I just saw the electrifying Iko Uwais doing his badarse thing in THE RAID: REDEMPTION. As it were, Rick Yune's vanity project draws a probably too generous 3 out of 5 stars. While I'm not down with his brand of cinema-fu, I am impressed with the commitment and drive he put in to keep his labor of love afloat.Rick Yune achieves the trifecta. Once a hedge fund trader (and, in fact, the film is partly financed by his contacts in the hedge fund district), Yune stars, writes, and co-produces THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT. And maybe that's too many hats to assume. The stuff he wrote, we've seen it all before. Again, in an action flick, the usually bare bones plot is there only to prop up the action sequences. But what if the action itself is less than fresh?In 1976, we eyeball the Jazz Man (Keith David), an assassin who is as cool as the other side of the pillow. In the midst of a gun fight, the Jazz Man ends up saving a young boy. He takes the boy in, calls him ""Chance,"" and, as fathers are wont to do, teaches him his profession. Except that this is something the Jazz Man wants his real son, Miles, to have no part of. Still, Miles and Chance grow close. Until Miles abandons the fam.Cut to the present, and Chance (Rick Yune) has made his father proud, having become one of the world's top contract killers. But Chance balks when his next target, a sultry R & B artist named Angel (Dania Ramirez), reunites him with his long-lost adoptive brother Miles (Bokeem Woodbine) who is on Angel's security detail. Having turned down his latest mark, Chance warns Miles that his client will soon fall in the crosshairs of Chance's murderous replacement. Now Chance and Miles must partner up to fend off Chance's colleagues, specifically the sadistic husband-and-wife hit team called Collateral Damage (""They love killin' as much as they love each other.""). I love the smell of dysfunction in the morning.The exotic backdrop of Bangkok is mostly wasted in this lackluster film. Action that blisters? No, brother. An action hero that turns your head? No, sir. Yune demonstrates minimal flair as a smiter of men. His fight scenes just don't pop. And he doesn't even get to take out the movie's big bad. Yune was attempting to showcase a fighting system called ""52 Blocks"" which originated in prison and which involves the use of space and certain rhythms. Except that this technique isn't really translated onscreen, and so we're stuck with generic shoot-'em-ups and anemic fighty fights.Acting-wise, Yune channels Michael Dudikoff at his most laconic. Rick Yune is so expressionless here, he makes professional poker players fidget. The drama plays out in dreary fashion. The actors are weighed down by forced and tedious dialogue. The two most charismatic players happen to be Keith David and Bokeem Woodbine, but even they can't salvage the script. Characters pop up out of nowhere and do a scene and then are disposed of (I'm mostly looking at you, Russian police interrogator). Some stuff bothered me more than others, and I guess I'll drop a SPOILER alert now for the rest of this paragraph. The speech that Angel weepingly delivers after the break-out from the Bangkok police precinct feels non-sequitur and so awkward, as if the writer moments before had just remembered he had to give her a backstory. There's a tired scene which borrows from THE TERMINATOR as the big bad storms the police precinct. One glaring plot hole near the end concerns Angel's over-reacting to what happens to Chance's adoptive dad whom she had never seen before. And if you haven't guessed from jump who's behind the contract on Angel's life, then would you be interested in purchasing Steven Seagal's ponytail? (I also have Van Damme's infamous forehead knot stored in a jar. And Dudikoff's Emmy.)Do yourself a favor. Get out of the house and see THE RAID: REDEMPTION. Rick Yune wishes he had Iko Uwais's moves... not to mention his screen presence.I will say that while actress Dania Ramirez gets stranded with a pretty thankless and objectified role, there's no denying that she looks very, very good.The DVD's bonus stuff:- ""Creating THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT"" - an interview with Rick Yune as he discusses his experience in acting in and writing the film, as well as the challenges he faced in producing it (00:18:48 minutes)- ""The Stunts of THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT"" - an interview with director Jesse Johnson and stunt coordinator Garret Warren, the most interesting bit of which is when Johnson enthusiastically speaks of Yune's remarkable commitment and his tireless efforts in his many hats during the film's shooting (00:25:53 minutes)",3,Yune's

1257887,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002A0KV6G,Mark Turner,"[4, 5]","Cold blooded killers are found everywhere in films. No doubt they exist in the real world as well. The biggest difference I would think would be in finding the cold blooded killer who has a moral code, who changes his mind midway through a job or who turns one down. Such is the case in the film THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT.Chance Templeton (Rick Yune) is a high profile assassin. There are few if any out there better at their work than Chance. As the film starts we see how good he is with the extermination of one target. Showing no emotion, Chance moves on to his hotel room and word of his next target.But this is when conscience kicks in. The next target is a pop singer who, for whatever reason, has been targeted to be killed in Bangkok. Chance's reason for turning down the job? The man in charge of overseeing her protection is Miles Templeton (Bokeem Woodbine), chances brother.Though not truly brothers, these two were raised as such. Miles' father Max ""Coolbreeze"" Templeton (Keith David) was a hired assassin who failed to reach one target, a man who killed both of Chance's parents. Murdered before Chance's eyes, Max took the child with him and raised him as his own. And Max trained both of his son's in his profession.Chance takes it upon himself to visit his brother at work and a warm welcome starts between the two. That all fades when he lets Miles know about the contract and his refusal to take it. Instead, they both realize that someone else will seal the deal and now must work together to prevent this from happening.A side piece between the two that talks about Miles change of life, how he joined the military and made something of himself more constructive than destructive is used to show the bond between brothers as well as the differences. It also gives Chance an opportunity to change his own life should he choose to do so.The pair take to protecting the pop star, a spoiled brat if there ever was one (can we say clich&eacute; character) named Angel (Dania Ramirez). The attempt is made in the middle of a crowded performance hall. The one plot question here is, if this star can afford this sort of protection shouldn't she be performing in a much larger arena instead of what appears to be a large club? In any event, during the attack, Chance kills one of the would be assassins, a woman.What isn't known at first is that the woman and her partner were married, a pair of assassins who are as fatal as Chance. Worse yet, the man is Z, the same man who killed Chance's parents years back. While Z has no idea who Chances is and vice versa, they are now locked in a grudge match as Z holds back nothing to find and kill the men responsible for his wife's death.As they hit the streets in an attempt to save Angel's life, Miles and Chance find the streets of Bangkok not so welcoming. Instead word bets back to Z and they are tracked down. Fighting in the middle of the streets, Miles is killed and Chance and Angel are on the run again.Eventually the person responsible for paying Z to take out Angel is revealed and while not surprising what happens to him is. It all leads to a final showdown between Chance and Z that offers a well done fight sequence.The movie is one that will be loved by action fans who clamor for the next big thing. Die hard action fans care little about plot devices, logic and over used stories. They wait for each moment of thrills, fights and explosions. All can be found here. And actually put together in an entertaining package.Rick Yune, who's been seen in THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS and DIE ANOTHER DAY, will be recognized by fans and should become a major force in the action film business if he's given a chance. And he rightfully deserves one based on his past work and the amount of effort he's placed here as writer/producer/star of this piece. His acting is fine, his martial arts moves slick and his ability to create a screen presence well done.Surprising to me was Bokeem Woodbine. I've long been a fan of his since a film he did called CAUGHT UP. It's nice to see him in a vehicle he seems to handle with ease. What surprised me were the martial arts/fight sequences he has. It's a side I've never seen on display with him and he does a stand up job.This film may not be for everyone but martial arts and action fans will want to add it to their rental list if not their own collections. It delivers the goods though with a plot seen before, but that never stopped a good action film before and won't in the future. Instead, sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.",3,DO THE RIGHT THING,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,4535,"['Cold', 'blooded', 'killers', 'are', 'found', 'everywhere', 'films', 'doubt', 'exist', 'real', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'biggest', 'difference', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'finding', 'cold', 'blooded', 'killer', 'who', 'moral', 'code', 'who', 'mind', 'midway', 'job', 'who', 'one', 'down', 'Such', 'case', 'film', 'THE', 'FIFTH', 'COMMANDMENT.Chance', 'Templeton', 'Rick', 'Yune', 'high', 'profile', 'assassin', 'are', 'few', 'there', 'better', 'work', 'Chance', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'good', 'extermination', 'one', 'target', 'Showing', 'emotion', 'Chance', 'hotel', 'room', 'word', 'next', 'target.But', 'when', 'conscience', 'kicks', 'next', 'target', 'pop', 'singer', 'who', 'reason', 'been', 'targeted', 'be', 'killed', 'Bangkok', 'Chance', 'reason', 'turning', 'down', 'job', 'man', 'charge', 'overseeing', 'protection', 'Miles', 'Templeton', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', 'chances', 'not', 'truly', 'brothers', 'two', 'were', 'raised', 'such', 'Miles', 'father', 'Max', 'Coolbreeze', 'Templeton', 'Keith', 'David', 'was', 'hired', 'assassin', 'who', 'failed', 'reach', 'one', 'target', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'Chance', 'parents', 'Murdered', 'Chance', 'eyes', 'Max', 'took', 'child', 'raised', 'own', 'Max', 'trained', 'son', 'profession.Chance', 'visit', 'brother', 'work', 'warm', 'welcome', 'starts', 'two', 'fades', 'when', 'Miles', 'know', 'contract', 'refusal', 'take', 'Instead', 'realize', 'someone', 'else', 'will', 'seal', 'deal', 'now', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'prevent', 'happening.A', 'side', 'piece', 'two', 'talks', 'Miles', 'change', 'life', 'how', 'joined', 'military', 'made', 'something', 'more', 'constructive', 'destructive', 'used', 'show', 'bond', 'brothers', 'as', 'well', 'differences', 'also', 'Chance', 'opportunity', 'change', 'own', 'life', 'should', 'choose', 'do', 'so.The', 'pair', 'take', 'protecting', 'pop', 'star', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'clich', 'eacute', 'character', 'named', 'Angel', 'Dania', 'Ramirez', 'attempt', 'made', 'middle', 'crowded', 'performance', 'hall', 'one', 'plot', 'question', 'here', 'star', 'can', 'afford', 'sort', 'protection', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'performing', 'much', 'larger', 'arena', 'instead', 'what', 'be', 'large', 'club', 'event', 'attack', 'Chance', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'assassins', 'woman.What', ""n't"", 'known', 'first', 'woman', 'partner', 'were', 'married', 'pair', 'assassins', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'fatal', 'Chance', 'Worse', 'yet', 'man', 'Z', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'Chance', 'parents', 'years', 'back', 'Z', 'idea', 'who', 'Chances', 'vice', 'versa', 'are', 'now', 'locked', 'grudge', 'match', 'Z', 'back', 'nothing', 'find', 'kill', 'men', 'responsible', 'wife', 'death.As', 'hit', 'streets', 'attempt', 'save', 'Angel', 'life', 'Miles', 'Chance', 'find', 'streets', 'Bangkok', 'not', 'so', 'welcoming', 'Instead', 'word', 'bets', 'back', 'Z', 'are', 'tracked', 'down', 'Fighting', 'middle', 'streets', 'Miles', 'killed', 'Chance', 'Angel', 'are', 'run', 'again.Eventually', 'person', 'responsible', 'paying', 'Z', 'take', 'out', 'Angel', 'revealed', 'not', 'surprising', 'what', 'final', 'showdown', 'Chance', 'Z', 'well', 'done', 'fight', 'sequence.The', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'loved', 'action', 'fans', 'who', 'clamor', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'Die', 'hard', 'action', 'fans', 'care', 'little', 'plot', 'devices', 'logic', 'used', 'stories', 'wait', 'moment', 'thrills', 'fights', 'explosions', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'actually', 'put', 'together', 'entertaining', 'package.Rick', 'Yune', 'who', 'been', 'seen', 'THE', 'FAST', 'AND', 'THE', 'FURIOUS', 'DIE', 'ANOTHER', 'DAY', 'will', 'be', 'recognized', 'fans', 'should', 'become', 'major', 'force', 'action', 'film', 'business', 'given', 'chance', 'rightfully', 'one', 'based', 'past', 'work', 'amount', 'effort', 'placed', 'here', 'writer/producer/star', 'piece', 'acting', 'fine', 'martial', 'arts', 'moves', 'slick', 'ability', 'create', 'screen', 'presence', 'well', 'done.Surprising', 'was', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', ""'ve"", 'long', 'been', 'fan', 'film', 'did', 'called', 'CAUGHT', 'UP', 'nice', 'see', 'vehicle', 'handle', 'ease', 'What', 'surprised', 'were', 'martial', 'arts/fight', 'sequences', 'side', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'display', 'stand', 'up', 'job.This', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'add', 'rental', 'list', 'not', 'own', 'collections', 'goods', 'plot', 'seen', 'never', 'stopped', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'future', 'Instead', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'ride']",The Fifth Commandment
1257888,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B002A0KV6G,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[3, 3]","Rick Yune has all the makings to be a good action hero: he's good-looking, legitimately athletic, and can act Van Damme under the table. ""The Fifth Commandment"" should have been the ultimate expo of what he can do in a starring role, opposed to the supporting parts he had inNinja AssassinandDie Another Day, but I'm sorry to say that his first solo vehicle is lacking. At first glance, it's a promising DTV film that avoids several of the more obvious mistakes plaguing the genre, but at some point, you realize that it's only going to get so good and no better. I really hope that Rick gets a few more chances to refine his craft in starring situations; he really could be the next big thing, but for now, this one will have to stick with a limited audience.The story: an orphaned boy is brought up by an aged master assassin (Keith David,The Thing) to learn the trade of killing; now a man, Chase (Yune) finds himself being hunted down by the murderer of his parents (Roger Yuan,Shanghai Noon) for interfering in his plans to assassinate a struggling pop singer (Dania Ramirez,Heroes).Man, I like this cast for some reason. Ramirez has the potential to get on your nerves when she starts whining and causing scenes, but you can push her into the background for most of the movie. Roger Yuan, veteran of B-movies, makes a great villain opposite of the inimitable Keith David, whose very presence in any film seems to better it by at least 10%. He really gets to milk his crotchety mentor role here, gets the best lines of the movie, and proves himself to be a badass even at age 52, so count your blessings. Bokeem Woodbine, who's as serviceable in low-budget fare like this as he was inRay, plays Chase's brother with charm and flair as the opposite side of the coin. Yune doesn't exactly have his work cut out for him as the two-note hero, but proves himself capable of versatility and generally makes it work. Yes, the ensemble is definitely the best feature, here.Production values are surprisingly strong throughout the picture: in a rare feat for the low-budget medium, director Jesse Johnson (Pit Fighter) goes beyond the bare necessities and skips superficial cover-ups and shortcuts to give the movie a legitimately stylish look and tone. However, in a special features interview, Yune admits that frequent rewriting of the script was required, leaving it less streamlined and offering a head-scratching scene wherein Chase discovers that his brother isn't dead like he had been told...but the audience was never made aware of this presumption priorly, so there's a bit of head-scratching. Also, the whole point of what Keith David does in the ending also continues to baffle me, but you'll have to check that one out for yourself. The fight scenes are the biggest letdown of all: shootouts are old-hat but generally passable, but three of the four hand-to-hand battles fall resoundingly short of matching the rest of the production quality via an overkill of quick-cut cheat editing...just like any old Steven Seagal movie these days. The final fight between Rick and Roger takes a noticeable leap forward in quality, helping to end the movie on a high note, but it's not great enough to make up for the laziness of the other encounters.It goes without saying that Rick Yune is destined for greatness, even if he stays within the DTV realm, but only if he can get over the debilitating slip-ups that plague this movie in the future. You can definitely go worse than this one with your low-budget movies, but if you're looking for a solid action movie, consider this one merely reserve material.",3,"""God doesn't care about people like us""",1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,3606,"['Rick', 'Yune', 'makings', 'be', 'good', 'action', 'hero', 'good-looking', 'legitimately', 'athletic', 'can', 'act', 'Van', 'Damme', 'table', 'Fifth', 'Commandment', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'ultimate', 'expo', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'starring', 'role', 'opposed', 'supporting', 'parts', 'had', 'inNinja', 'AssassinandDie', 'Day', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'first', 'solo', 'vehicle', 'lacking', 'first', 'glance', 'promising', 'DTV', 'film', 'several', 'more', 'obvious', 'mistakes', 'plaguing', 'genre', 'point', 'realize', 'only', 'going', 'get', 'so', 'good', 'better', 'really', 'hope', 'Rick', 'few', 'more', 'chances', 'refine', 'craft', 'starring', 'situations', 'really', 'could', 'be', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'now', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'stick', 'limited', 'audience.The', 'story', 'orphaned', 'boy', 'brought', 'up', 'aged', 'master', 'assassin', 'Keith', 'David', 'Thing', 'learn', 'trade', 'killing', 'now', 'man', 'Chase', 'Yune', 'being', 'hunted', 'down', 'murderer', 'parents', 'Roger', 'Yuan', 'Shanghai', 'Noon', 'interfering', 'plans', 'assassinate', 'struggling', 'pop', 'singer', 'Dania', 'Ramirez', 'Heroes', '.Man', 'like', 'cast', 'reason', 'Ramirez', 'potential', 'get', 'nerves', 'when', 'whining', 'causing', 'scenes', 'can', 'push', 'background', 'most', 'movie', 'Roger', 'Yuan', 'veteran', 'B-movies', 'great', 'villain', 'opposite', 'inimitable', 'Keith', 'David', 'very', 'presence', 'film', 'better', 'least', '10', '%', 'really', 'milk', 'crotchety', 'mentor', 'role', 'here', 'best', 'lines', 'movie', 'be', 'badass', 'even', 'age', '52', 'so', 'count', 'blessings', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', 'who', 'as', 'serviceable', 'low-budget', 'fare', 'was', 'inRay', 'Chase', 'brother', 'charm', 'flair', 'opposite', 'side', 'coin', 'Yune', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'two-note', 'hero', 'capable', 'versatility', 'generally', 'work', 'Yes', 'ensemble', 'definitely', 'best', 'feature', 'here.Production', 'values', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'picture', 'rare', 'feat', 'low-budget', 'medium', 'director', 'Jesse', 'Johnson', 'Pit', 'Fighter', 'bare', 'necessities', 'skips', 'superficial', 'cover-ups', 'shortcuts', 'give', 'movie', 'legitimately', 'stylish', 'look', 'tone', 'However', 'special', 'features', 'interview', 'Yune', 'frequent', 'rewriting', 'script', 'was', 'required', 'leaving', 'less', 'streamlined', 'offering', 'head-scratching', 'scene', 'wherein', 'Chase', 'brother', ""n't"", 'dead', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'audience', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'aware', 'presumption', 'priorly', 'bit', 'head-scratching', 'Also', 'whole', 'point', 'what', 'Keith', 'David', 'ending', 'also', 'baffle', ""'ll"", 'have', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'biggest', 'letdown', 'shootouts', 'are', 'old-hat', 'generally', 'passable', 'three', 'four', 'hand-to-hand', 'battles', 'fall', 'resoundingly', 'short', 'matching', 'rest', 'production', 'quality', 'overkill', 'quick-cut', 'cheat', 'editing', 'just', 'old', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'movie', 'days', 'final', 'fight', 'Rick', 'Roger', 'noticeable', 'leap', 'forward', 'quality', 'helping', 'end', 'movie', 'high', 'note', 'not', 'great', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'laziness', 'other', 'encounters.It', 'saying', 'Rick', 'Yune', 'destined', 'greatness', 'even', 'DTV', 'realm', 'only', 'can', 'get', 'debilitating', 'slip-ups', 'plague', 'movie', 'future', 'can', 'definitely', 'go', 'worse', 'one', 'low-budget', 'movies', ""'re"", 'looking', 'solid', 'action', 'movie', 'consider', 'one', 'merely', 'reserve', 'material']",The Fifth Commandment
1257889,AZXHK8IO25FL6,B002A0KV6G,ribcage,"[5, 5]","The Fifth Commandment was a fun, somewhat mesmerizing film. The cinemtography was awesome, giving a really immersive feeling, although there's a blue tint to it that occassionally threw me off, but it was still a beautiful film to watch. And that's something really special coming out a straight up action movie.The story follows an assassin who is troubled with his choices in life who is contracted to kill a troubled young pop star. The problem is that his adoptive brother, who his adopted father told him was dead, turns out to be part of her bodyguard troupe. So he passes the assignment, and protects his brother and the target from the next duo of assassins who are given the job leading to the main conflict of the movie.And the conflict was top notch. Every burst of gunfire felt powerful, the car chase sequence jarring, the fistfight sequences grueling and damaging. All of it was choreographed and filmed expertly, and there was plenty of it at just the right pace. It's everything an action junkie could ask for. The finale even takes place in a FLAMMABLE MATERIALS WAREHOUSE!The story and characters give the film a sort of classic 70s grindhouse action feel too, so this separates it from being a run of the mill action movie. Even though the story's not all that gripping, and the dialogue is 100% typical action movie lines (no one-liners but lots of melodrama) it all meshes. It's a really, really fun film and definitely packed full of grade A action.The soundtrack is great too. It calls back to the glory days of the late 90s/early 00s when anytime something exciting started to happen exciting songs would start playing. So leading into almost every fight we get some bass-heavy music or excitable violent rap songs playing. It may sound, tacky, but it's not overused and the songs are very well chosen and fit nicely.All in all, a very solid action flick.",4,really good action,1256342400,"10 24, 2009",2009,1879,"['Fifth', 'Commandment', 'was', 'fun', 'somewhat', 'mesmerizing', 'film', 'cinemtography', 'was', 'awesome', 'giving', 'really', 'immersive', 'feeling', 'blue', 'tint', 'occassionally', 'threw', 'off', 'was', 'still', 'beautiful', 'film', 'watch', 'something', 'really', 'special', 'coming', 'out', 'straight', 'up', 'action', 'movie.The', 'story', 'assassin', 'who', 'troubled', 'choices', 'life', 'who', 'contracted', 'kill', 'troubled', 'young', 'pop', 'star', 'problem', 'adoptive', 'brother', 'who', 'adopted', 'father', 'told', 'was', 'dead', 'out', 'be', 'part', 'bodyguard', 'troupe', 'assignment', 'brother', 'target', 'next', 'duo', 'assassins', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'job', 'leading', 'main', 'conflict', 'movie.And', 'conflict', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'burst', 'gunfire', 'felt', 'powerful', 'car', 'chase', 'sequence', 'jarring', 'fistfight', 'sequences', 'grueling', 'damaging', 'was', 'choreographed', 'filmed', 'expertly', 'there', 'was', 'plenty', 'just', 'right', 'pace', 'everything', 'action', 'junkie', 'could', 'ask', 'finale', 'even', 'place', 'FLAMMABLE', 'MATERIALS', 'WAREHOUSE', 'story', 'characters', 'give', 'film', 'sort', 'classic', '70s', 'grindhouse', 'action', 'feel', 'too', 'being', 'run', 'mill', 'action', 'movie', 'Even', 'story', 'not', 'gripping', 'dialogue', '100', '%', 'typical', 'action', 'movie', 'lines', 'one-liners', 'lots', 'melodrama', 'meshes', 'really', 'really', 'fun', 'film', 'definitely', 'packed', 'full', 'grade', 'A', 'action.The', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'too', 'back', 'glory', 'days', 'late', '90s/early', '00s', 'when', 'anytime', 'something', 'exciting', 'started', 'happen', 'exciting', 'songs', 'would', 'start', 'playing', 'So', 'leading', 'almost', 'fight', 'get', 'bass-heavy', 'music', 'excitable', 'violent', 'rap', 'songs', 'playing', 'may', 'sound', 'tacky', 'not', 'overused', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'chosen', 'fit', 'nicely.All', 'very', 'solid', 'action', 'flick']",The Fifth Commandment
