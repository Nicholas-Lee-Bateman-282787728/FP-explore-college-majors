677038,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,B00005R1MF,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[5, 5]","To charge a ridiculously high price for an abridged release of any TV series is a crime. In this case it only adds insult to injury. This TV show was never fully appreciated, much less promoted in it's original run, which coincided with the early years of The Simpsons. But that can be credited to Fox Television's still relatively early, unsure of itself years when it wasn't quite sure where to emphasize its marketing. Nevertheless, that's no reason to perpetuate that crime in its DVD release. Chris Elliott was perfectly cast in this role of the live at home with the folks, 30 year old paper boy. It gave him an avenue of extention for the dry wit he demostrated in his years on David Letterman (who can forget, the man under the stands, and his Marlon Brando routines on that show). Watching this show you can see where producers cast him as the lead in ""Cabin Boy,"" again, another unappreciated work. The wit and sarcasm are the same, as is the way he irks those around him, including his own folks, which includes his real life dad Bob Elliott of classic old time radio fame, and Elanor Donahue of ""Father Knows Best"" and ""Andy Griffith,"" where she played a before her time sexy pharmacist named Ellie. I give this series 2 stars merely due to the quality of the episodes themselves, which  was the perfect marriage of writers who worked around Elliotts' delivery and humor. On that it should get a 5, but the collection offered here is a disgrace. This show ranks as one of the top 2 TV shows to get cut short before given a fair chance, along with ""Police Squad,"" which at least was given a second life in movie theaters via ""The Naked Gun"" movies. Elliott deserved better than just ""Cabin Boy"" towards that end. Try again on the DVD release boys. Either do it right, or it shouldn't have been done at all.",2,Worst treatment of one of the most under rated TV shows ever,1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,1817,"['charge', 'ridiculously', 'high', 'price', 'abridged', 'release', 'TV', 'series', 'crime', 'case', 'only', 'insult', 'injury', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'much', 'less', 'promoted', 'original', 'run', 'coincided', 'early', 'years', 'Simpsons', 'can', 'be', 'credited', 'Fox', 'Television', 'still', 'relatively', 'early', 'unsure', 'years', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'emphasize', 'marketing', 'Nevertheless', 'reason', 'perpetuate', 'crime', 'DVD', 'release', 'Chris', 'Elliott', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'live', 'home', 'folks', '30', 'year', 'old', 'paper', 'boy', 'gave', 'avenue', 'extention', 'dry', 'wit', 'demostrated', 'years', 'David', 'Letterman', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'man', 'stands', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'routines', 'show', 'Watching', 'show', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'producers', 'cast', 'lead', 'Cabin', 'Boy', 'again', 'unappreciated', 'work', 'wit', 'sarcasm', 'are', 'same', 'way', 'including', 'own', 'folks', 'real', 'life', 'dad', 'Bob', 'Elliott', 'classic', 'old', 'time', 'radio', 'fame', 'Elanor', 'Donahue', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'where', 'played', 'time', 'sexy', 'pharmacist', 'named', 'Ellie', 'give', 'series', '2', 'stars', 'merely', 'due', 'quality', 'episodes', 'was', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'writers', 'who', 'worked', 'Elliotts', 'delivery', 'humor', 'should', 'get', '5', 'collection', 'offered', 'here', 'disgrace', 'show', 'one', 'top', '2', 'TV', 'shows', 'get', 'cut', 'short', 'before', 'given', 'fair', 'chance', 'Police', 'Squad', 'least', 'was', 'given', 'second', 'life', 'movie', 'theaters', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'movies', 'Elliott', 'deserved', 'better', 'just', 'Cabin', 'Boy', 'towards', 'end', 'Try', 'again', 'DVD', 'release', 'do', 'right', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'done']",N/A
677039,A2HP9COIPKXQ1I,B00005R1MF,"B-MAN ""B""","[44, 45]","""Get A Life"" was one of the weirdest and most dementedly funny sitcoms I ever saw. It ran on Fox from September 1990 to March 1992 and totaled 35 episodes. So why oh why are they releasing 4 episode DVDs? Anyone who is going to buy a 4 episode DVD of this show is going to buy a complete season DVD set. So where is it?  Anyway, fans will be pleased with ""Get A Life"" being released at all, but if and when the complete season 1 DVD set comes out, getting these 4 episode discs will have been a waste of money. Some people might say that a complete ""Get A Life"" set will never come out, but I can't remember how many times I have read that there will be no ""South Park"" complete season sets and now the first season is due out in November! Don't get me wrong, the contents on this ""Get a Life, vol. 2"" disc will be funny and deranged, but 4 episodes? What's the point? There is only 35 episodes! 22 of them make up the first season.  ""Mad About You"" also has 22 episodes in it's first season and that's being released in October on 2 discs! How about giving ""Get A Life"" the same treatment and pleasing the mentally disturbed people, like myself who love this show!

This show is about a 30 year old paperboy who never grows up in every sense of the word.
