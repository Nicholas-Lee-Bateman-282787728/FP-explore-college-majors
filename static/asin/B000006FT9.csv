First let us talk about the motorcycle gang from HELL, the cops can&#65533;t stop them no one is aloud to leave their house after dark because they blow everything up that crosses their path. And to top that off with some chocolate syrup their leader is a psychopath scared for life the bad guy Pike! Now let us talk about Barry Allen, he is a scientist who lives a life of shame by his father, a job that&#65533;s taking him nowhere, a jealous brother, and a relationship that&#65533;s on the rocks. That was his life until he got electrocuted by lighting and had a bunch of chemicals spilled all over him, after that life was a little bit on the weird side! One day he was trying to catch a bus and in the next second he was at the other side of town! After a talk with a doctor from S.T.A.R LABS he finds out that he can run faster then anybody has ever ran before. (We&#65533;re talking hundreds of miles in seconds!)

For a lighthearted story about a cartoon character, maybe this is the way it ought to be done, at least in spirit. All this dark stuff with blood, guts and tons of profanity isn't the way most of us look at cartoon heroes.I saw this on tape and I'm hoping the DVD, if I ever get it, has improved sound. The Flash, who is here-and-there ""in a flash,"" needs good surround sound to go with the special-effects, and the tape didn't have it. I could more easily put up with the amateurish dialog.The movie has charm, however, because of the added comedy mixed in with the action, and the likable hero, portrayed by John Wesley Shipp. I liked the female lead, too, played by the pretty Amanda Pays.This is nothing spectacular, by any means, but a fun, harmless and entertaining hour-and-a- half.

I happen to like the series episodes better than this pilot movie, but that may just be me.  (the villian isn't as good as those in the series)This is a very cool story that tells the origin of the Flash character (i.e. how he became the flash).  Although not EXACTLY faithful to the comic book...WHO CARES?!This is a good movie and a fun time if you like the Flash or superheroes in general.  Most likely, a satisfying rental.

493776,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000006FT9,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 10]","""The Flash"" only aired on CBS during the 1990-91 season, but it is fondly remembered by those who watched it on Thursday nights, even though it was an hour-long program that started on the half-hour (ah, the joys of counterprogramming). The series is remembered fondly as one of the better television programs adapted from a comic book, and I can make the argument that historically it is an important series because it raised the bar regarding such shows. Before ""The Flash"" there was the all-time camp classic ""Batman,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" and television movies (a.k.a. failed pilots) for ""Dr. Strange,"" ""Captain America,"" and assorted other superheroes. After ""The Flash"" we got ""Lois & Clark"" and ""Smallville."" In retrospect, I have to believe that ""The Flash"" not only revitalized interest in comic books for TV but made producers think of such projects as being more than funny books for kids. The explanation for this is to be found in this 2-hour television movie, the pilot for the series.In this television incarnation of the fastest man alive, Barry Allen (John Wesley Shipp) is a police chemist working in Central City's crime lab. One night a lightning bolt hits his lab and Barry is covered with chemicals. This causes a metabolic change in his body that allows him to move at superhuman speed (i.e., so fast that he cannot be seen with the naked eye). However, he can only do this in short bursts (otherwise there is going to be a rather limited potential for conflict in each episode). Terrified by his strange new powers, Barry turns to Tina McGee (Amanda Pays), a research scientist working for Star Labs, for help in find a cure. Meanwhile, Barry continues to get grief from his family, because while older brother Jay Allen (Tim Thomerson) is captain of the city's police motorcycle division trying to track down the Dark Riders, a violent biker gang, our hero is just working in the forensic lab.If you grew up on comic books and are well versed with Superhero Origins 101, then you can guess what happens next to make these plot lines collide. Yes, the story is predictable, especially if you know virtually anything about the Flash character created for DC comics by Gardner Fox and Harry Lampert. The script here by Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo is certainly competent in setting up the necessary elements for the entire series, with Julio (Alex Desert) the lab assistant who never figures out Barry is the Flash, the demanding father (M. Emmet Walsh), and the cops who can never catch up with the Flash (Biff Manard and Vito D'Ambrosio). Director Robert Iscove makes excellent use of the special effects, which offer some nice comic moments. More importantly Shipp gets across the idea that he wants to do some good with some actual earnestness and Pays still had cache after ""Max Headroom.""The bottom line is that by the standards of comic books on television, ""The Flash"" is the best television adaptation and pilot movie up to that time, and it continues to hold up today. The series was not great but stayed well above average on the basis of some interesting guest villains (most notably Mark Hamill). Final point: Actually, despite having the Barry Allen name of the second flash (Jay Garrick was the first), the Flash of the television series is a bit more hip like Wally West (the third Flash).",5,The first really good comic book television movie,1052956800,"05 15, 2003",2003,3329,"['Flash', 'only', 'aired', 'CBS', '1990-91', 'season', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'who', 'watched', 'Thursday', 'nights', 'even', 'was', 'hour-long', 'program', 'started', 'half-hour', 'ah', 'joys', 'counterprogramming', 'series', 'remembered', 'fondly', 'one', 'better', 'television', 'programs', 'adapted', 'comic', 'book', 'can', 'make', 'argument', 'historically', 'important', 'series', 'raised', 'bar', 'regarding', 'such', 'shows', 'Flash', 'was', 'all-time', 'camp', 'classic', 'Batman', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'television', 'movies', 'a.k.a', 'failed', 'pilots', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'Captain', 'America', 'assorted', 'other', 'superheroes', 'Flash', 'got', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'Smallville', 'retrospect', 'have', 'believe', 'Flash', 'not', 'only', 'revitalized', 'interest', 'comic', 'books', 'TV', 'made', 'producers', 'think', 'such', 'projects', 'being', 'more', 'funny', 'books', 'kids', 'explanation', 'be', 'found', '2-hour', 'television', 'movie', 'pilot', 'series.In', 'television', 'incarnation', 'fastest', 'man', 'alive', 'Barry', 'Allen', 'John', 'Wesley', 'Shipp', 'police', 'chemist', 'working', 'Central', 'City', 'crime', 'lab', 'One', 'night', 'lightning', 'bolt', 'lab', 'Barry', 'covered', 'chemicals', 'metabolic', 'change', 'body', 'move', 'superhuman', 'speed', 'i.e.', 'fast', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'naked', 'eye', 'However', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'short', 'bursts', 'otherwise', 'going', 'be', 'rather', 'limited', 'potential', 'conflict', 'episode', 'Terrified', 'strange', 'new', 'powers', 'Barry', 'Tina', 'McGee', 'Amanda', 'Pays', 'research', 'scientist', 'working', 'Star', 'Labs', 'help', 'find', 'cure', 'Meanwhile', 'Barry', 'get', 'grief', 'family', 'older', 'brother', 'Jay', 'Allen', 'Tim', 'Thomerson', 'captain', 'city', 'police', 'motorcycle', 'division', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'Dark', 'Riders', 'violent', 'biker', 'gang', 'hero', 'just', 'working', 'forensic', 'lab.If', 'grew', 'up', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'well', 'versed', 'Superhero', 'Origins', '101', 'then', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'next', 'make', 'plot', 'lines', 'collide', 'Yes', 'story', 'predictable', 'especially', 'know', 'virtually', 'anything', 'Flash', 'character', 'created', 'DC', 'comics', 'Gardner', 'Fox', 'Harry', 'Lampert', 'script', 'here', 'Danny', 'Bilson', 'Paul', 'De', 'Meo', 'certainly', 'competent', 'setting', 'up', 'necessary', 'elements', 'entire', 'series', 'Julio', 'Alex', 'Desert', 'lab', 'assistant', 'who', 'never', 'out', 'Barry', 'Flash', 'demanding', 'father', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'cops', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'catch', 'up', 'Flash', 'Biff', 'Manard', 'Vito', ""D'Ambrosio"", 'Director', 'Robert', 'Iscove', 'excellent', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'offer', 'nice', 'comic', 'moments', 'More', 'importantly', 'Shipp', 'idea', 'do', 'good', 'actual', 'earnestness', 'Pays', 'still', 'had', 'cache', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'bottom', 'line', 'standards', 'comic', 'books', 'television', 'Flash', 'best', 'television', 'adaptation', 'pilot', 'movie', 'up', 'time', 'hold', 'up', 'today', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'stayed', 'well', 'above', 'average', 'basis', 'interesting', 'guest', 'villains', 'most', 'notably', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'Final', 'point', 'Actually', 'having', 'Barry', 'Allen', 'name', 'second', 'flash', 'Jay', 'Garrick', 'was', 'first', 'Flash', 'television', 'series', 'bit', 'more', 'hip', 'Wally', 'West', 'third', 'Flash']",N/A
