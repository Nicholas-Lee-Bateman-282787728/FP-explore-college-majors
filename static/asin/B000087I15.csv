Are they really selling these overpriced no subtitled dvd-r ripoffs??

Great writing and actingby some of the best actors. Tom Selleck is in this! If youare a fan of mystery/horror than this is a good movie tosee what you missed. They don't make them like this.

He wants it because one of the witches looks like his wife. Once he gets the painting home, strange things start happening. First, a Rottweiler (aka: Devil dog) appears. Then, a new housekeeper arrives, and takes over the household! Both the dog and the housekeeper were in the painting! Now, their images are fading away! Next, the art dealer who sold Jim the painting winds up dead! Plus, Jim's wife is acting nutty, and she's carrying a big, ceremonial dagger around! Can Jim figure out what's going on before his wife loses her last marble? DAUGHTERS OF SATAN is an absurdly entertaining devil movie from 1973.

The lead actress also shines here , the supporting csst isn't half bad either. The problem is the vague script and low budget. This was made in the phillipines , that country at the time had it's own film industry and produced some wild movies like 'octoman' and some decent war movies too. These were all low budget affairs but they have some charm, this one has a unclear plot in that the satanists reincarnatied witches don't remember who they are. This just spoils the premise to a degree but it's at least in english and the print looks pretty good on dvd. It's horror exploitation (it has some nudity fmeale of course and scenes of half naked women getting whipped too) but that doesn't save this one in the end. However I love horror flicks and have seen alot worse.  the idea of the painting possessing people was a good one too but it's the blanking out part of this that spoils it.",2,tom rises above the script,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,972,"['movie', 'early', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'performance', 'very', 'well', 'lead', 'actress', 'also', 'here', 'supporting', 'csst', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'problem', 'vague', 'script', 'low', 'budget', 'was', 'made', 'phillipines', 'country', 'time', 'had', 'own', 'film', 'industry', 'produced', 'wild', 'movies', ""'octoman"", 'decent', 'war', 'movies', 'too', 'were', 'low', 'budget', 'affairs', 'have', 'charm', 'one', 'unclear', 'plot', 'satanists', 'reincarnatied', 'witches', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'premise', 'degree', 'least', 'english', 'print', 'pretty', 'good', 'dvd', 'horror', 'exploitation', 'nudity', 'fmeale', 'course', 'scenes', 'half', 'naked', 'women', 'getting', 'whipped', 'too', ""n't"", 'save', 'one', 'end', 'However', 'love', 'horror', 'flicks', 'have', 'seen', 'alot', 'worse', 'idea', 'painting', 'possessing', 'people', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'too', 'blanking', 'out', 'part']",N/A
