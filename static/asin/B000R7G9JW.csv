McIntyre ""Texasexpat""","[68, 79]","I liked so many things about ""Boy Culture"" that I had to think long and hard about giving the film only three stars (and would have been three and a half if Amazon had that feature).Q. Allan Brooks had a limited budget and shooting schedule (not unusual for gay films). Yet ""Boy Culture"" has a good look, with many location shots in Seattle. Sexy Darryl Stephens' line readings are often stiff and awkward, so time for 2nd takes must have been very limited. The lack of money was most evident in the background music -- awful pretty much covers it.The story of a high priced male escort and his two sexy roommates is always interesting, especially as the potential for a relationship between X and Andrew seems more and more possible. The 3rd roommate, barely legal Joey, is wonderful as the forever trick happy new guy in town. The theme of friends becoming lovers and then friends and finally lovers again isdone very well.Now the major problem. A high priced male escort (one check for his very short term company was for $5,000) could not survive in Seattle with only 12 clients who want sex and little or no personal intimacy. X might find 12 clients who fit that mold in New York or Los Angeles, but not in a smaller city. Escorting requres personality and charm, which X does not possess; it is not all about sex. In fact, some of the highest priced escorts are not great in bed.The special features provide insights into the story and the way the director approcahed the filming of a popular book. I learned quite a bit about the lead actors in their individual Q&As.; The lack of a commentary makes the special features fun, but not a necessity.Finally the film played much better in a sold out movie theater, with Darryl Stephens in the audience, than it did on home DVD.

1079453,A1Y7C52533BA2H,B000R7G9JW,Blake Fraina,"[2, 3]","I read the book this film was based on about four years ago and loathed it. Loathed it. As a matter of fact, I couldn't believe that it had been made into a film and had utterly no intention of ever watching it. Ever. But I was bored one evening so I watched the preview on Here! on Demand and it actually looked more intriguing than the book, so, with trepidation, I checked it out.The verdict? Not bad. Not great, but such a huge improvement over the book that I couldn't help but be impressed. It tells the story of X (Derek Magyar), an exclusive call boy who earns [unrealistically] large sums of money from an elite clientele of twelve men. He shares his loft with two men, one of whom he harbors a secret crush on (Noah's Ark's Darryl Stephens), while the other, a twinkie teenaged club-kid (Jonathon Trent), has a not-so-secret crush on him. The book was brimming with cynicism and sarcasm (badly masquerading as dry wit), both of which have been toned down considerably for the film. And, mercifully, all the raunchy, ostensibly comic, moments between X and his various fetishistic johns have been eliminated entirely.I don't care for voiceover narration, which is usually a cop-out way of telling rather than showing, but in this case maybe it can be forgiven because it's an attempt to recreate the narrative voice of the novel. But even giving it the benefit of the doubt, I still found it annoying - particularly as I didn't find the protagonist's observations to be very interesting or witty. All three leads are attractive and put in decent, if not exactly Oscar-worthy, performances. The cinematography is quite lush looking considering this was likely a low budget affair. And, if this sort of thing is important to you, there is a romantic ending.Recommended - with caveats",3,Three and a Half Stars [for Improving on the Book],1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,1790,"['read', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'loathed', 'Loathed', 'matter', 'fact', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'film', 'had', 'utterly', 'intention', 'ever', 'watching', 'Ever', 'was', 'bored', 'one', 'evening', 'so', 'watched', 'preview', 'Here', 'Demand', 'actually', 'looked', 'more', 'intriguing', 'book', 'so', 'trepidation', 'checked', 'out.The', 'verdict', 'Not', 'bad', 'Not', 'great', 'huge', 'improvement', 'book', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'impressed', 'story', 'X', 'Derek', 'Magyar', 'exclusive', 'call', 'boy', 'who', '[', 'unrealistically', 'large', 'sums', 'money', 'elite', 'clientele', 'twelve', 'men', 'shares', 'loft', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'whom', 'secret', 'crush', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'Darryl', 'Stephens', 'other', 'twinkie', 'teenaged', 'club-kid', 'Jonathon', 'Trent', 'not-so-secret', 'crush', 'book', 'was', 'brimming', 'cynicism', 'sarcasm', 'badly', 'masquerading', 'dry', 'wit', 'have', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'considerably', 'film', 'mercifully', 'raunchy', 'ostensibly', 'comic', 'moments', 'X', 'various', 'fetishistic', 'johns', 'have', 'been', 'eliminated', 'entirely.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'usually', 'cop-out', 'way', 'telling', 'rather', 'showing', 'case', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'narrative', 'voice', 'novel', 'even', 'giving', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'still', 'found', 'annoying', 'particularly', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'protagonist', 'observations', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'witty', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'attractive', 'put', 'decent', 'not', 'exactly', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'quite', 'lush', 'looking', 'considering', 'was', 'likely', 'low', 'budget', 'affair', 'sort', 'thing', 'important', 'romantic', 'ending.Recommended', 'caveats']",N/A

They have money and are regular consumers of ""X""...and who the hell can blame them.  You don't get to see this so calm down.  He has 2 roomates - Blowey Joey (Jonathon Trent - who has a speech impediment caused by his abnormally long tongue) and Andrew (Darryl Stephens - Noah's Arc).

1079459,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000R7G9JW,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This short film is entertaining as you watch scores of handsome gay men in the Seattle area as they work, live and love. The story is one of a male prostitute who has supported himself for 10 years in this manner, narrowing down his clients to 12 wealthy men. He rents bedrooms in his stylish apartment so as to throw off the IRS as to his real profession. Derek Magyar plays the part of X, the prostitute, and does a good job of a man who represses pain. Andrew Thompson, a handsome African American man is played by Darryl Stephens. Joey, an 18 year old club kid is played by Jonathan Trent. Both Andrew and Joey create a sexual tension in the home.This is basically a film about the courage to love. Through the film we learn that X once fell in love with a school mate, made love, and then was rejected by his new love. Since that time, he operates as a sex machine, staying always in control, and never allowing himself to fall in love and thus become vulnerable to another person. Yet he does fall in love with Andrew and he fights against these feelings so as to avoid relationship, avoid love, avoid commitment, and thus avoid emotional hurt.Andrew has gradually fallen in love with X and begins to try to penetrate X's hard veneer of cold calculation and cynicism. X's sarcasm and hurtful comments however keep Andrew at a distance. Give the man credit that he keeps trying. He tells X he will keep trying up to a point and then if X does not bring down his wall of defenses, then Andrew will move on. Andrew is actually one of the most emotionally mature characters in the film.The turning point for X comes with a new client, George Talbot, played well by Patrick Buchanan. George gradually seduces X with a long tale of his relationship with his lover and the courage to act on emotion. This tale is cautionary and helps X realize he must act or lose Andrew forever.In the end the film is about the courage to risk love. For young Joey, this is no risk at all and he falls deeply in love with X. To the credit of X, he is mature enough to realize that this 18 to 30 romance would never work and X takes on a parental role for Joey. We gradually learn that George is not telling the truth and that he did not have a lover for 50 years but instead is a lonely reclusive man who never really revealed his love to the man he cared for. But George redeems himself by calling on Andrew and revealing to Andrew that X cares for him even if X is unable to risk being hurt.Does risking love always pay off? Of course not. But 'the pain of having loved and lost is far better than never having loved at all'. I don't remember who said that famous line but it is the central theme of this film.",4,the risk of love,1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,2695,"['short', 'film', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'scores', 'handsome', 'gay', 'men', 'Seattle', 'area', 'work', 'live', 'love', 'story', 'one', 'male', 'prostitute', 'who', 'supported', '10', 'years', 'manner', 'narrowing', 'down', 'clients', '12', 'wealthy', 'men', 'bedrooms', 'stylish', 'apartment', 'so', 'throw', 'off', 'IRS', 'real', 'profession', 'Derek', 'Magyar', 'part', 'X', 'prostitute', 'good', 'job', 'man', 'who', 'pain', 'Andrew', 'Thompson', 'handsome', 'African', 'American', 'man', 'played', 'Darryl', 'Stephens', 'Joey', '18', 'year', 'old', 'club', 'kid', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Trent', 'Andrew', 'Joey', 'create', 'sexual', 'tension', 'home.This', 'basically', 'film', 'courage', 'love', 'film', 'learn', 'X', 'once', 'fell', 'love', 'school', 'mate', 'made', 'love', 'then', 'was', 'rejected', 'new', 'love', 'time', 'sex', 'machine', 'staying', 'always', 'control', 'never', 'allowing', 'fall', 'love', 'thus', 'become', 'vulnerable', 'person', 'fall', 'love', 'Andrew', 'feelings', 'so', 'avoid', 'relationship', 'avoid', 'love', 'avoid', 'commitment', 'thus', 'avoid', 'emotional', 'hurt.Andrew', 'gradually', 'fallen', 'love', 'X', 'try', 'penetrate', 'X', 'hard', 'veneer', 'cold', 'calculation', 'cynicism', 'X', 'sarcasm', 'hurtful', 'comments', 'however', 'keep', 'Andrew', 'distance', 'Give', 'man', 'credit', 'trying', 'will', 'keep', 'trying', 'up', 'point', 'then', 'X', 'not', 'bring', 'down', 'wall', 'defenses', 'then', 'Andrew', 'will', 'move', 'Andrew', 'actually', 'one', 'most', 'emotionally', 'mature', 'characters', 'film.The', 'turning', 'point', 'X', 'new', 'client', 'George', 'Talbot', 'played', 'well', 'Patrick', 'Buchanan', 'George', 'gradually', 'X', 'long', 'tale', 'relationship', 'lover', 'courage', 'act', 'emotion', 'tale', 'cautionary', 'X', 'realize', 'must', 'act', 'lose', 'Andrew', 'end', 'film', 'courage', 'risk', 'love', 'young', 'Joey', 'risk', 'deeply', 'love', 'X', 'credit', 'X', 'mature', 'enough', 'realize', '18', '30', 'romance', 'would', 'never', 'work', 'X', 'parental', 'role', 'Joey', 'gradually', 'learn', 'George', 'not', 'telling', 'truth', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'lover', '50', 'years', 'instead', 'lonely', 'reclusive', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'revealed', 'love', 'man', 'cared', 'George', 'calling', 'Andrew', 'revealing', 'Andrew', 'X', 'cares', 'even', 'X', 'unable', 'risk', 'being', 'hurt.Does', 'risking', 'love', 'always', 'pay', 'off', 'course', 'not', 'pain', 'having', 'loved', 'lost', 'far', 'better', 'never', 'having', 'loved', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'who', 'said', 'famous', 'line', 'central', 'theme', 'film']",N/A

First of all, any film that has more than 20% narration bothers me.  The reason is simple--I do NOT need to be ""read"" to.  I'm smart enough to figure a few things out.  Keep your mouth shut--especially when you're droning on-and-on about a character with about as much substance as s turnip.  Derek Magyar plays the call boy ""X"" and he also narrates, ad nauseum, the story.  His character was mean, cruel, thoughtless, and uncaring about other's feelings.

1079464,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000R7G9JW,Grady Harp,"[8, 11]","BOY CULTURE is a very fine little film and were it being evaluated solely within the confines of gay films, it would easily rate 5 stars. It is well written, well directed, well acted and has messages that cover a fairly broad territory (racism, homophobia, hustler life style, relationships, coming out tales and tales from the closet, etc). There are some technical flaws with the film and some unresolved character problems that prevent it from being what it comes close to being, but finally here is a gay themed film that is wise, entertaining, and user-friendly for a larger population than the community for which it was made.The story is biographical in nature: ""X"" (Derek Magyar) is a male hustler who lives off the income from a limited client&egrave;le of regulars, who occupies a living space with two gay roommates - Andrew (Darryl Stephens) and Joey (Jonathon Trent) - and who has what he thinks it takes to make him happy. The missing element is love, and in several ways he comes into proximity with that missing thread: his newest client is Gregory (Patrick Bauchau in a richly nuanced performance as a elderly closeted loner) who introduces X to the finer things in life, including introspection and looking for what is missing in his world. Andrew is a conflicted African American man who still misses the caring he had with a girlfriend whose wedding he is to attend. Joey has just turned 18 and looks to X and Andrew as father figures. The problem is that X and Andrew have deeper feelings of attraction and commitment to each other than either wants to admit, and the story (as narrated by X) is about how this mutual challenging need is resolved.Q. Allan Brocka directed and co-wrote the film with Philip Pierce and the dialog is snappy at times and gently tender at others. The cast is quite fine: the young lads are top notch eye candy while bringing solid acting skills to their roles, and the older actors bring a since of resilience to the story that keeps it grounded in style. This is a very good little film that deserves a wider audience, one that needs to see this aspect of the population once considered merely peripheral. Movies like this help understanding interpersonal relationships, and everyone needs to address that.

X worked his way through the University of Washington by prostituting himself to his dentist.  After graduation, he built up a clientele of twelve customers willing to pay very high amounts for his services.  (A zoom looked like $5,000/ 1 hour session; X must be very good indeed.)  In order to disguise the source of his income from the IRS, X took on two roommates for zero rent each.  One roommate is video store employee Andrew Thompson (played by Darryl Stephens), and the other is promiscuous eighteen-year old Joey (played by Jonathon Trent), who lives off an allowance and hasn't gone past his GED for schooling.  One of X's twelve clients just died, giving him a chance to interview seventy-nine-year old penthouse-dweller Gregory Talbot (played by Patrick Bauchau) as the replacement.  This is where the film starts.X, Andrew, and Joey all want love and a better life.  Inevitably a triangle formed, sometimes oriented one way, sometimes the other.  In general, Joey wants X, X wants Andrew, and Andrew has sex once with Joey.  Each partly expresses his love for the others, but internal issues prevent any resolutions.  Gregory develops a strong, confiding relationship with X but holds back a key piece, whose revelation catalyzes the triangle.  Everyone moves ahead and gets a happy next stage.The movie ""Boy Culture"" is based reasonably closely on Matthew Rettenmund's 1995 book of the same name.  The big changes are that the location moves from Chicago to Seattle, the story line relating to Joey's brother is gone, Andrew and his family shift from standard Midwest white folk to middle-class, Oregon-based African-Americans, and Gregory is allowed to move from disgrace to helpful uncle-figure.  We learn X's real name.  All of these shifts are well done and add value to the story.The principals all have substantial skin scenes.  There are club-goers, bartenders, a hilarious hook-up pantomime, and the like to provide more.  It's all really hot!All of four the principals are splendid; I look forward to seeing more of their work coming out.  Of the actors of smaller parts, I thought Peyton Hinson did especially well as Andrew's former fianc&eacute;e, Jill, whose marriage to a pro-football player leads Andrew and X to visit Andrew's family.The extras are unusually good.  There is a Q&A; session at the Tribeca premiere with the director (Q. Allan Brocka),  Magyar,  Trent, and a producer present.  Most valuable is that the director and the four principals each gets an approximately fifteen minute interview to discuss the film, his role, and his choices.  The viewer gets to know and like these talented artists even more.  There are two deleted scenes as well.The film does an excellent job of showing the attractions and inhibitions of gay relationships and is certainly the best gay-oriented film of the year.

And you know what, to become one, not everything has to be an emotional downer like the exceptional ""Brokeback Mountain.""  The 'light romance' film category has its ""Classics,"" too.  And this film, this ""Boy Culture"" is so good it's almost ""fairy tale-ish"" (that's meant in a good way).....so different from what films usually give us about ourselves (Q. Allan Brocka:  ""King of Gay Filmdom"").Yes, it is a love story.....one about looking for love---a real and lasting love---and being afraid to accept it when it's found.  And ""X"" proclaims it so simply and clearly when he first introduces us to Andrew:  ""That's who this is all about.""  (And wouldn't you, the viewer, then think that puts Andrew in an all-powerful position.....well, just wait and see).But, enough about the story.  While many other online reviewers here have already talked about story line.....plot, lets us now do some ""actor digging.""First, it's got to be said that this is not one of those movies where one need only watch facial expressions, or body language, and listen to what's being said.  Oh, no, in this one it's an absolute must to ""watch the eyes"".....you've just got to ""watch the eyes.""  Why?  Because Derek Magyar (""X"") has great eyes---he can make love to you with those eyes.  And did you even catch how many times his eyes had tears in them?  Amazing!  And while it's Darryl Stephens who has the beautiful eyes, it's Derek who has the world in his.  Watch for them misting up when he knows he's been cutting and unkind to Andrew, or when at a wedding he becomes aware he's about to lose out on the only person he knows he wants / he loves.  Oh, and, for the fun of it, be sure to watch closely what he does with those eyes at that point in the film where he enters their digs and sits down right against Andrew on the sofa.  Just watch where those eyes ""go to"" (you'll be able to picture yourself having done exactly what he does).  Yes, those eyes are his most devastating physical feature.....I so hope you have a large and clear enough screen to see all this.  Again, he's just amazing!  Am I in love?  Yes, I am.Second, what else can you say about the two young lead characters in this fairy tale of love, other than that they have ""those feelings"" for one another......if only they'd let themselves stop to realize it.  In that exciting, near-the-end scene (which is a repeat of another love tale told in this story), when asked what he is doing, ""X"" replies: ""Waiting for you"" (going on to tell us, in voice-over: ""The words haunted me"").  We, the viewers, then realize, as does he, that's exactly what he has been doing throughout the entire film narrative:  ""Waiting for Andrew""......to accept Andrew.  BUT, dear readers, whether he accomplishes that is for you to find out.Everything in and about this production moves like the proverbial clockwork; there really are no rough spots.  How Director ""Q"" got these levels of performance out of this ""tri-pod"" of, essentially, first-timers-to-movies (Magyar, Stephens and Jonathon Trent), is almost unprecedented and beyond me.  To be factual, though, it is really more of a ""quad-pod,"" when you stop to realize that our good, senior Mr. Patrick Bauchau is as much a ""cast leg"" of this production as any of the other three.  But.....the important thing for us to note is that ""Q"" did draw out top notch levels of performance, and he has, indeed, given us that rarity---a gay love story that provides a ""lives happily ever after.""  You needed that, I needed that,  (Ennis and Jack needed that), we all needed that.  Thank you immeasurably, Mr. Brocka, nephew of The Philippine's Lino Brocka, director of 1988's ""Macho Dancer"" (we know; it's in the genes, it's in the genes).  I'm so looking forward to what you give us in the future.  If I knew a way to invest in you, fiscally, I would.A final thought for a specific audience segment---Isn't it interesting that any ""real simulated"" sex in this production (that means 'anal' for those of you wondering) is not necessarily between our young lead characters.  Perhaps, instead, we Seniors out here might just get the goods---for once.

This is how I've felt about the vast majority of gay-themed movies.  Most of them, to be blunt, are crap.  Supply and demand dictates that, due to the relatively few writers and directors working in this genre, that most gay-themed movies are disappointing and would never be green-lit if their audience was more mainstream, i.e., straight.""Boy Culture"", despite its generic title, is a refreshing exception to this rule.  Warm, touching, sexy, and smart, this movie is a good example of gay independent movie making.  The voice-over of the main character may be a bit cheap, but it's quite effective in the end.  The leads are all extremely watchable, attractive, and endearing.  I don't know which one of them was gay or straight, but I neither did I care.  Each of them inhabited their roles without resulting to trite stereotypes, or, as insulting to me, personally, the opposite -- playing ""straight"".  The result was that I felt that each character was a real person.While I do not think it will appeal to the majority of straight audiences, it is simply a Must-Watch for us gays.

Allan Brocka based on a novel of the same name, it is a much more matured and intelligent movie than Eating Out series which he directed also. The movie has cute straight actors Derek Magyar (X), Jonathon Trent (Joey), and Darryl Stevens (Andrew), also a seasoned powerful actor Patrick Bauchau (Gregory.)X, Andrew, and Joey are roommates. X is a cold hearted high roller hustler with 12 clients (12 disciples.) He likes what he does and considers it as a very high paying job. He does not care about the morals. He does not believed in true love even though is secretly in love with Andrews. Andrews is an athletic young African American who thinks that what X does is wrong. Joey is a flamboyant, feminine young kid that X likes and picked up, felt sorry for him. Joey is in love with X but he pretty much rejects the idea.The movie is set in Seattle, Washington. The beginning scene has received some acclaimed where X is filmed upside down while riding in a bus.X meets a new client, Gregory, an older, refined, cultured, and educated gentleman, who hires him for sex but uses the time to talk to him and figured out what kind of person. A fatherly bond develops between these two, where X starts opening up to him with his problems. There is finally the sexual encounter between the two toward the end of the movie.X and Andrews go around and around each other trying to prevent from getting involved personally. X's walls to protect from getting hurt are just too thick and strong. At home there is always the scenes where X looks at Andrews tenderly and in love but nothing never happens. Joey, a third party, is a flaming queen who thinks only of sex, He just wants a happy family.There is finally a trip to Andrews' parents house (Portland) to attend the wedding of a girlfriend he used to have in his youth. Apparently he dated her because he was interested in her brother (who discovers that he is gay.) Andrews has asked X to go along with him so that he looked like he was not alone. X rents a very expensive car so they go in style. The trip becomes a disaster because of X not letting up on his feelings. When they returned home, Andrews decided to move back home.Gregory interferes by visiting Andrews to stopping from making the same mistake he did when he was young. Andrews and X become a couple a he pays X a penny every time they make love. Andrews accepts X as what he is, a pay hustler.This movie is nice. Even though X is a hustler, there is no poverty and abuse. This may make the movie rather a fantasy and I wish type. They all live in a very nice apartment with expensive things. The one client which is most portrayed is very rich, living in a very expensive, exclusive place. There are bar scenes, but again a nice place.
