338001,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302814766,Acute Observer,"[2, 2]","The credits list some actors who were well-known in the 1940s. This story is based on the Stephen King novel. Are some savages about to sacrifice a human? It's a cultural thing. There are gunshots to announce messengers with news from the States. [Is that Newark airport?] There is a funny scene at the used car lot! They arrive at the old house. ""Thanks a lot Aunt Clara."" The welcome wagon greets them. Then night falls. Teenagers learn to respect the residents. Children take care of the homeless. ""Tell it to the judge."" Is their welcome too good to be true? Where is Jeremy going?They raise cows for milk and other products. Human blood can be infected with hepatitis, drugs, AIDS, etc. They want an anthropologist to record their society for the future. The children attend school at night. Kathy waited for Joey all these years. ""Good Day, Dear."" The people love their cows very much. An old geezer rolls up in his old jalopy asking for directions. Are those people the descendants of the ""Speedwell""? [Those are Holstein cows (black and white), not Jersey cows (brown).] Has Jeremy developed a sensitivity to sunlight? There is a fight in the stream, and Joe is captured. The vampires are very wealthy, they've lived for 300 years and have grown wealthy from real estate. [What about taxes?] Is Van Meer looking for a Nazi? Van Meer knows how to cut out the red tape! Why did a Short Line bus stop at Salem's Lot? The townspeople entertain the tourists and travelers. Jeremy learns how to whittle to make a point. Is Kathy ""one of them""?So Van Meer and Joe Weber go about their task of saving humanity from the vampire menace of Salem's Lot. Shots are fired, they keep rolling up a body count. Will Van Meer step into a trap? His P-38 saves him, along with some Holy Water. Will fire consume the vampires? There is a showdown at the school. There are more gory effects in their escape. Many coffins burn. [Does the EPA approve?] Is there any safe place in town? Ever wonder why the flag poles of yesteryear have a spear point? The sun comes up and Van Meer and Joe and Jeremy leave. Now Jeremy has can write a winning essay on what he did on his summer vacation.Aside from ""Salem's Lot"" there are echoes of ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", and other films. This is one of the funniest horror films since ""Love at First Bite"". This is an entertaining fast-paced film but it won't be appreciated by everyone. There are shocking words in the beginning; they would be censored on broadcast TV. The story line is so crude is had to be done for comic effects.

It does not tie in much beyond that.  The premise this time is more unusual.  The town is completely occupied by vampires and those that serve them.  One of the more bizarre things in this movie is the servants of the vampires are half vampire, half human offspring of the vampires themselves.  These offspring can move about in daylight and are the virtual slaves of their own parents.  Their purpose is to make the town look normal for passerby's and to work during the day while the vampires rest.  They also take Anne Rice's theory that a child who is turned into a vampire would have to mature mentally and yet would be trapped forever in the body of a child to the next level.  There is one scene depicting a wedding where the bride and groom appear to be children but are actually adults.  Overall, they tried to do something a little different with this movie and it makes it interesting.  What it has going for it is lots of old school horror movie elements with a few new twists.

338006,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,6302814766,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 2]","WARNING: ""A Return to Salem's Lot"" is a sequel to ""Salem's Lot"" in name only. No characters return. The plot isn't followed up on. No mention is made of anything that happened in the previous movie.If the name of the town were changed (instead of LOUDLY OVERSTATED), this movie would have nothing to do with ""Salem's Lot"" -- but honestly, that wouldn't have saved it. Even seen as a standalone movie, this sequel-in-name-only is a mediocre piece of work, with hilariously bad acting and strange direction... as well as the awesomest character EVER.Anthropologist Joe Weber (Michael Moriarty) is called back to the US by his ex-wife, who wants him to spend some time with their dysfunctional adolescent son Jeremy (Ricky Addison Reed). So he takes Jeremy out to Salem's Lot, where he owns a decrepit house. And after a hysterical girl begs for his help, he quickly discovers that the town is populated by vampires (and their human ""drones"").The vampire leader, Judge Axel (Andrew Duggan), has a special task in mind for Joe: he wants Joe to write the vampire ""Bible"" chronicling their history. At first Joe is reluctantly willing to do this task, but when Jeremy shows signs of being pulled into the vampire fold, he becomes determined to escape. But it's only when an odd old man (Samuel Fuller) comes to town that he has a chance.The biggest problem with ""A Return To Salem's Lot"" is not that it's a sequel -- it's that it's just a really mediocre vampire movie. Director/producer/writer Larry Cohen just doesn't make it scary or suspenseful, and it's filmed in an ultra-low-budget style that makes it look like Cohen filmed it in his hometown, starring his neighbors.To be fair, there are a few spooky moments. The early handling of the ""ordinary"" vampires' lives is both funny and unnerving -- little old ladies in floral dresses reapplying their makeup after drinking a screaming girl's blood.But all that pretty much dies in the second half, which is just a plodding mess. Nowhere else can vampire-slaying be so DULL, and horror staples (vampire children, rubber monsters) become tedious. There are also some pretty horrifying ideas woven into it (the human ""drones"" who are basically malevolent slaves), but doesn't really explore them. And Cohen has some serious issues with continuity -- Joe is established as an amoral jerk who has no problem watching HUMANS murder each other, but he suddenly is just horrified by people being killed by vampires. Yes, because that is SO much worse.And as mentioned, Joe is an amoral jerk. Did I mention he was an amoral jerk? Because he is. As a result, his hypocritical horror at the vampires feels entirely hollow, especially since he never has a revelatory moment where he realizes what a horrible person he's been. Jeremy is truly his father's son... meaning he's a horrible brat, but at least he seems to be somewhat suggestible rather than just a jerk.Duggan seems to be doing his best with the genially cruel Judge Axel, and there are moments where you can almost believe he is what he claims to be. Moriarty doesn't seem to know how his role should be played, so he opts for the howling ham. Most of the other actors have the acting ability of wet plywood, particularly Katja Crosby as Joe's vampire lover Cathy.However... there is one redeeming performance in this movie: Samuel Fuller as an elderly, blunt-spoken Nazi-killing veteran who can accept the existence of vampires and head out to slay them without batting an eye. I love this character. I want this guy in every single movie EVER.Sadly, Fuller's awesomeness is not enough to keep ""A Return to Salem's Lot"" from being a clumsy mess with characters that are despicable at best.

I still like it today, though. What I remember from years ago was it had a cool old guy in it and it took place partly in a church. I knew the old guy as the director of one of my favorite war movies: The Big Red One. Years later, the old guy is still pretty cool and ads a little life into a movie that has a lot going for it.  Director Larry Cohen teams up with actor Michael Moriarty for the fourth time in their careers. Larry Cohen has contributed quite a bit to horror as a writer and director. His best known movies are the It's Alive series. I would have to say that this movie is one of the better teamings of Cohen and Moriarty. They first worked on the cult classic The Stuff and then went on to be participants in It's Alive 3: Island of The Alive which was an entertaining sequel. Then they made this movie and finally the last teaming between the two was the Masters of Horror episode: Pick Me Up which is my favorite Masters of Horror episode. There is a lot of action in this movie and it keeps getting better as it goes along. The vampires are totally in control of Salem's Lot and it is fun to see Michael Moriarty, his son and the cool old guy battle for their lives in this one. When I saw it was a DVD-R I thought that it would mean that this would be a VHS-like transfer to DVD. That was not the case. The picture is crystal clear and definitely DVD quality. The movie is also 1:85.1 widescreen which is another plus. This movie still holds up well. It is not as good as the original, of course, but that is a classic.

Compared to the original ""Salem's Lot"" movie (and its more recent remake), this movie is absolute garbage. However, if you look at it as a stand alone movie it wasn't quite as bad. I guess I liked it better this time around because I hadn't seen the original in many years. The acting is weak at times, but the movie has a certain charm about it that made me not completely hate it. It had the makings of a movie that might have been excellent if it had had a stronger script and more focus on the vampires instead of on the humans.The DVD release itself was quite good. The movie looked great. The sound was mostly great too. This movie got a much nicer release than some movies that are twice as good. I'm glad I took a chance and bought a copy of this movie for nostalgia. I bought it thinking it might be one of those movies that is ""so bad, it's good"" in later years.
