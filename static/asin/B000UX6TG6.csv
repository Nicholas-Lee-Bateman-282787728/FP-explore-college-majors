1097069,A3VBZDYGHF4NK8,B000UX6TG6,"Movie Maker ""Rik""","[3, 3]","This is one of the two specials Doris did for CBS, and it is impossible to resist her charm.Her rendition of ""The Way We Were"" is on par with the jazzy version of ""Hooray For Hollywood"" that is sampled all the time.  Listen to BOTH songs in full, to get their impact.(of course ""Hooray"" is not on this item, but find it!)Doris was always a style maven, and she looks fantastic.  You will LOVE this!  Doris was in fine form, and you can tell that production spent time and money to assure a great show.The 70's and 80's were hard for many stars, Doris included.This is a great snapshot of the time- a sensational show with a superstar talent.  At the time it remined one of the highest rated television shows of the year.How foolish of CBS and the studios to ignore her charm, talent and ability to attract an audience.  I am quite sure that she never thought this would  be a good bye to her millions of fans.  I hope you enjoy the show as much as I did.P.S. For those of you who are HUGE Doris fan's (like me!) -- Can you imagine how nice the CBS series ""Murder She Wrote"" might have been with with our Super-Style Doris?Nothing against dear Angela, but Doris would have rocked the airwaves in that part!Do get this DVD at the great AMAZON price, and share it-- we simply do NOT have talent and style like this anymore.

1097070,A2RD8FEU7MKSD5,B000UX6TG6,Mr. Gary L. Shapiro,"[1, 13]","If you didn't live in the 1970's you might watch this TV special and think that that was what television looked like in the 1970's, and you would be largely correct. Then, as now, there was mostly crap on TV with occasional bright spots. Most of the bright spots, as the flood of DVDs from that era suggest, are best remembered as opposed to revisited. This special is painful to watch. The stilted dialog and bad jokes, which are always followed by a cacophony of canned laughter, are just so bad. Doris' singing is also painful as she tries to be hip and now by singing ""Day By Day,"" a tuneless faux rock song from the musical Godspell. John Denver had just moved from being a sincere folk singer in the mold of Tom Paxton, to being a Superstar pal of Frank Sinatra, a career path which eventually would cost Denver his credibility and send his recording career spiraling down. On this special he trades unfunny quips with Doris, but then, just when it seemed impossible for anything good to happen, he sings his oldie ""Follow Me,"" as Doris Day sits cross-legged on the floor and lays on a marvelous harmony. This could have been a really great show, if they had just done away with the lame comedy and sung songs that were suited to them. Tim Conway does some pointless and uncharacteristically unfunny comedy with Doris. There are some other guests also. So, this is completely a waste of time. It was a waste in 1975 and it is a waste now, except, somehow, it is fun to watch. It is a little time machine into the era of President Ford; an America adjusting, uncomfortably, to a powerful youth culture and the presence of African Americans in the mainstream. CBS was still a colossus, operating as it had for decades. And Doris Day, one of the great movie stars a decade earlier, trying to stay relevant.",3,A Time Machine,1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,1809,"['did', ""n't"", 'live', '1970', 'might', 'watch', 'TV', 'special', 'think', 'was', 'what', 'television', 'looked', '1970', 'would', 'be', 'largely', 'correct', 'Then', 'now', 'was', 'mostly', 'crap', 'TV', 'occasional', 'bright', 'spots', 'Most', 'bright', 'spots', 'flood', 'DVDs', 'era', 'suggest', 'are', 'best', 'remembered', 'opposed', 'revisited', 'special', 'painful', 'watch', 'stilted', 'dialog', 'bad', 'jokes', 'are', 'always', 'followed', 'cacophony', 'canned', 'laughter', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'bad', 'Doris', 'singing', 'also', 'painful', 'be', 'hip', 'now', 'singing', 'Day', 'Day', 'tuneless', 'faux', 'rock', 'song', 'musical', 'Godspell', 'John', 'Denver', 'had', 'just', 'moved', 'being', 'sincere', 'folk', 'singer', 'mold', 'Tom', 'Paxton', 'being', 'Superstar', 'pal', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'career', 'path', 'eventually', 'would', 'cost', 'Denver', 'credibility', 'send', 'recording', 'career', 'spiraling', 'down', 'special', 'unfunny', 'quips', 'Doris', 'then', 'just', 'when', 'seemed', 'impossible', 'anything', 'good', 'happen', 'oldie', 'Me', 'Doris', 'Day', 'cross-legged', 'floor', 'marvelous', 'harmony', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'great', 'show', 'had', 'just', 'done', 'away', 'lame', 'comedy', 'sung', 'songs', 'were', 'suited', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'pointless', 'uncharacteristically', 'unfunny', 'comedy', 'Doris', 'are', 'other', 'guests', 'also', 'So', 'completely', 'waste', 'time', 'was', 'waste', '1975', 'waste', 'now', 'somehow', 'fun', 'watch', 'little', 'time', 'machine', 'era', 'President', 'Ford', 'America', 'adjusting', 'uncomfortably', 'powerful', 'youth', 'culture', 'presence', 'African', 'Americans', 'mainstream', 'CBS', 'was', 'still', 'colossus', 'operating', 'had', 'decades', 'Doris', 'Day', 'one', 'great', 'movie', 'decade', 'earlier', 'trying', 'stay', 'relevant']",Doris Day Today

1097073,A1Q87II9MJL7JF,B000UX6TG6,Paul Brogan,"[80, 84]","In 1975 Doris Day completed her obligation to CBS Television by starring in a hugely popular one hour variety show.  This beautifully produced special is rated five stars because Doris Day sings.  That in itself warrants five stars.Looking no more than 25 years old, Miss Day is in top-form and one can only regret that she didn't do more specials, or films, or recordings after this outing.  Vocally she is superb!!!The special generously mixes comic skits with musical interludes and utilizes Miss Day's guest stars, John Denver, Rich Little, Tim Conway and the dancing group, The Lockers, to good effect. While the comedy sketches are not especially side-splitting, Miss Day and Conway are amusing together.John Denver is probably the most prominent guest on the show and he proves to be disarming.  His chemistry with Miss Day is genuine and real and they run the gamut from ""Follow Me"", a Sunshine medley, ""Exactly Like You"" and a very cute series of song snippets that use the stars' real names and vintage tunes. Day and Denver look more like brother and sister.The sequence with Rich Little imitating, flawlessly, several of Miss Day's on-screen co-stars is a great excuse for Day to sing bits of some of her most beloved hits including ""Everybody Loves a Lover"", ""Teacher's Pet"", ""Secret Love"" and the inevitable, ""Whatever Will be, Will Be"".Finally it is Doris Day who makes the hour work. Her vocal rendering of ""Day by Day"" from the musical ""Godspell"" is pitch perfect.  ""The Way We Were"" has NEVER been sung more beautifully than Miss Day's version.Among the bonus features on this DVD release is Miss Day's appearance on the December, 1974 John Denver Special.  She, Denver and George Gobel do a very funny skit that pokes good natured fun at Miss Day's on-screen image.  Day and Denver sing bits of three songs from Day's early 50's musicals.As a wonderful reminder of what a brilliant vocalist Doris Day is, this DVD release should be a must for everyone.",5,DORIS DAY TODAY AND EVERY DAY!,1194393600,"11 7, 2007",2007,1971,"['1975', 'Doris', 'Day', 'completed', 'obligation', 'CBS', 'Television', 'starring', 'hugely', 'popular', 'one', 'hour', 'variety', 'show', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'special', 'rated', 'five', 'stars', 'Doris', 'Day', 'sings', 'warrants', 'five', 'stars.Looking', 'more', '25', 'years', 'old', 'Miss', 'Day', 'top-form', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'regret', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'specials', 'films', 'recordings', 'outing', 'Vocally', 'superb', 'special', 'generously', 'mixes', 'comic', 'skits', 'musical', 'interludes', 'utilizes', 'Miss', 'Day', 'guest', 'stars', 'John', 'Denver', 'Rich', 'Little', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'dancing', 'group', 'Lockers', 'good', 'effect', 'comedy', 'sketches', 'are', 'not', 'especially', 'side-splitting', 'Miss', 'Day', 'Conway', 'are', 'amusing', 'together.John', 'Denver', 'probably', 'most', 'prominent', 'guest', 'show', 'be', 'disarming', 'chemistry', 'Miss', 'Day', 'genuine', 'real', 'run', 'gamut', 'Me', 'Sunshine', 'medley', 'Exactly', 'very', 'cute', 'series', 'song', 'snippets', 'use', 'stars', 'real', 'names', 'vintage', 'tunes', 'Day', 'Denver', 'look', 'more', 'brother', 'sister.The', 'sequence', 'Rich', 'Little', 'imitating', 'flawlessly', 'several', 'Miss', 'Day', 'on-screen', 'co-stars', 'great', 'excuse', 'Day', 'sing', 'bits', 'most', 'beloved', 'hits', 'including', 'Everybody', 'Lover', 'Teacher', 'Pet', 'Secret', 'Love', 'inevitable', 'Will', 'be', 'Will', 'Be', '.Finally', 'Doris', 'Day', 'who', 'hour', 'work', 'vocal', 'rendering', 'Day', 'Day', 'musical', 'Godspell', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Way', 'Were', 'NEVER', 'been', 'sung', 'more', 'beautifully', 'Miss', 'Day', 'version.Among', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'release', 'Miss', 'Day', 'appearance', 'December', '1974', 'John', 'Denver', 'Special', 'Denver', 'George', 'Gobel', 'do', 'very', 'funny', 'skit', 'good', 'natured', 'fun', 'Miss', 'Day', 'on-screen', 'image', 'Day', 'Denver', 'sing', 'bits', 'three', 'songs', 'Day', 'early', '50', 'musicals.As', 'wonderful', 'reminder', 'what', 'brilliant', 'vocalist', 'Doris', 'Day', 'DVD', 'release', 'should', 'be', 'must', 'everyone']",Doris Day Today
