1397425,A1L9T258BHJZFE,B004DQMSM0,Alexander,"[6, 6]","What a thoroughly enjoyable holiday DVD this is. It's not a spectacular production that we may see on occasion, but instead is an intimate perfomance which really conveys the sense that ""you are there"".Orla Fallon is a genuine and remarkable entertainer. Besides having an angelic voice, her delicate mannerisms and rich cultural personality only enhance the joyous musical experience. I watched this DVD all the way through for the first time with my family (we had seen some tidbits on PBS), and we all were enthralled.It was a brave move for Orla to leave such a successful group as Celtic Woman, but as this DVD demonstrates with crystal clarity, she has triumphed.The marketing of this concert was very astute: appeareances by David Archuleta (American Idol), Mark Wills (Country), and Meav (Celtic Woman) all contribute to a very balanced and appealing program.Very well done; 5 Stars!",5,Orla Fallon is Simply Fantastic!,1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,891,"['What', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'holiday', 'DVD', 'not', 'spectacular', 'production', 'may', 'see', 'occasion', 'instead', 'intimate', 'perfomance', 'really', 'sense', 'are', 'there', '.Orla', 'Fallon', 'genuine', 'remarkable', 'entertainer', 'having', 'angelic', 'voice', 'delicate', 'mannerisms', 'rich', 'cultural', 'personality', 'only', 'enhance', 'joyous', 'musical', 'experience', 'watched', 'DVD', 'way', 'first', 'time', 'family', 'had', 'seen', 'tidbits', 'PBS', 'were', 'enthralled.It', 'was', 'brave', 'move', 'Orla', 'leave', 'successful', 'group', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'DVD', 'crystal', 'clarity', 'triumphed.The', 'marketing', 'concert', 'was', 'very', 'astute', 'appeareances', 'David', 'Archuleta', 'American', 'Idol', 'Mark', 'Wills', 'Country', 'Meav', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'contribute', 'very', 'balanced', 'appealing', 'program.Very', 'well', 'done', '5', 'Stars']",Orla Fallon's Celtic Christmas

If there were something equivalent to the Academy Award in the ""Best Irish Singer""  category, Orla Fallon would be under spot lights every year!  She is that good!

1397429,A1XQP1HXYJCUZP,B004DQMSM0,Dan Coffee,"[1, 1]","This is a classic in terms of what not to do when making a musical video. I really liked the CD so the natural next step was to buy the video. What a waste! After first being force-fed a commercial plug for discoverireland.com, we open the show with a panoramic aerial view of what I assume is Ireland. Among the aerial shots is a field full of what I'm guessing is a herd of reindeer (complete with obvious speckling of reindeer dung on the ground). As the introductory scenes finish and the show begins, it is done with a video dissolve which allows us to see Orla beginning to perform her first number. The first thing I noticed, (that sticks out like a sore thumb), is this HUGH black handheld microphone. It is daunting enough to make me believe that a London bobby must be missing his Billy club. To best describe how wrong it is to use this particular device, in profile camera shots it is distracting, but in full-face cameras shots it is just plain annoying! She holds it high enough to almost entirely block out the lower half of her face. Even in moments when she is just talking (rather than singing) the head of the microphone is so large that it often hides her smile. Speaking as a long time admirer of Orla,(and her assets), I think it's clear that apart from her voice, her smile is probably her best asset. Having it obscured when it could have been avoided, is unbelievable stupid!As the show moves along, we get a very welcome guest appearance by M&eacute;av N&iacute; Mhaolchatha. [For those of you who don't know who she is, she was one of the original Celtic Woman singers.] Her entrance on stage is ruined by one of far too many tactlessly interjected shots of audience activity. In this particular blunder of video editing, a shot of a little girl `pointing' is spliced in, at just about the worst possible moment. In essence, this lame attempt to glitz up the show does just the opposite, actually deemphasizing Meav's descent down a tread of stairs, to join Orla in singing `Do You Hear What I Hear?' Talk about bad production decisions ... Well I guess giving her a pie in the face might have been worse. Untimely and poorly chosen camera shots of the audience doing, (or in some cases not doing,) certain things, are another major part of what ruined this show. The next blunder is one of the `not doing' variety.To provide a second bookend so to speak, to the blunder of ruining Meav's entrance, they managed to throw in yet another poorly placed shot of the audience. This time, the injected clip showed that the crowd gave her only a limited standing ovation, and at points showing more people still sitting than standing.  You know ... If you are going to emphasize that someone gets a standing ovation, you really shouldn't use shots that show people NOT standing!The next song in the show is interesting in that Orla dispatches the Billy club, or excuse me ... the handheld microphone. Mysteriously NOW she is wearing a nearly invisible head-mic, and begins playing the harp as she sings. This tells us that she didn't have to use the enormous hand mic at all; she could have used the other from the start!Well at this point there doesn't seem to be any good reason to point out anymore of the screw-ups, (but believe me, I could write pages).I don't want to end on a negative note. Orla is easily on my top twenty list of favorite singers and I wish her all the best. My suggestion to you, is to buy the DVD anyway. It's not perfect, but I haven't seen one yet that was. Orla is a delight to listen to and even though the video is not what I hoped, she tried to give us a good show. And who knows ... maybe I've lowered your expectations enough that you will truly enjoy it.In any case ... Do buy the CD. I haven't written a review for it (yet) but it's worth 4 stars.[Your comments are always welcome.]",3,Orla is not to be blamed for this POOR production,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,3839,"['classic', 'terms', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'when', 'making', 'musical', 'video', 'really', 'liked', 'CD', 'natural', 'next', 'step', 'was', 'buy', 'video', 'What', 'waste', 'first', 'being', 'force-fed', 'commercial', 'plug', 'discoverireland.com', 'open', 'show', 'panoramic', 'aerial', 'view', 'what', 'assume', 'Ireland', 'aerial', 'shots', 'field', 'full', 'what', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'herd', 'reindeer', 'complete', 'obvious', 'speckling', 'reindeer', 'dung', 'ground', 'introductory', 'scenes', 'finish', 'show', 'done', 'video', 'dissolve', 'see', 'Orla', 'beginning', 'perform', 'first', 'number', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'HUGH', 'black', 'handheld', 'microphone', 'daunting', 'enough', 'make', 'believe', 'London', 'bobby', 'must', 'be', 'missing', 'Billy', 'club', 'best', 'describe', 'how', 'wrong', 'use', 'particular', 'device', 'profile', 'camera', 'shots', 'distracting', 'full-face', 'cameras', 'shots', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'high', 'enough', 'almost', 'entirely', 'block', 'out', 'lower', 'half', 'face', 'Even', 'moments', 'when', 'just', 'talking', 'rather', 'singing', 'head', 'microphone', 'so', 'large', 'often', 'smile', 'Speaking', 'long', 'time', 'admirer', 'Orla', 'assets', 'think', 'clear', 'apart', 'voice', 'smile', 'probably', 'best', 'asset', 'Having', 'obscured', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'unbelievable', 'stupid', 'show', 'along', 'get', 'very', 'welcome', 'guest', 'appearance', 'M', 'eacute', 'N', 'iacute', 'Mhaolchatha', '[', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'original', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'singers', ']', 'entrance', 'stage', 'ruined', 'one', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'tactlessly', 'interjected', 'shots', 'audience', 'activity', 'particular', 'blunder', 'video', 'editing', 'shot', 'little', 'girl', 'pointing', 'spliced', 'just', 'worst', 'possible', 'moment', 'essence', 'lame', 'attempt', 'glitz', 'up', 'show', 'just', 'opposite', 'actually', 'deemphasizing', 'Meav', 'descent', 'down', 'tread', 'stairs', 'join', 'Orla', 'singing', 'Do', 'Hear', 'What', 'Hear', 'Talk', 'bad', 'production', 'decisions', 'Well', 'guess', 'giving', 'pie', 'face', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'Untimely', 'poorly', 'chosen', 'camera', 'shots', 'audience', 'doing', 'cases', 'not', 'doing', 'certain', 'things', 'are', 'major', 'part', 'what', 'ruined', 'show', 'next', 'blunder', 'one', 'not', 'doing', 'variety.To', 'provide', 'second', 'bookend', 'so', 'speak', 'blunder', 'ruining', 'Meav', 'entrance', 'managed', 'throw', 'yet', 'poorly', 'placed', 'shot', 'audience', 'time', 'injected', 'clip', 'showed', 'crowd', 'gave', 'only', 'limited', 'standing', 'ovation', 'points', 'showing', 'more', 'people', 'still', 'sitting', 'standing', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'emphasize', 'someone', 'standing', 'ovation', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'use', 'shots', 'show', 'people', 'NOT', 'standing', 'next', 'song', 'show', 'interesting', 'Orla', 'Billy', 'club', 'excuse', 'handheld', 'microphone', 'Mysteriously', 'NOW', 'wearing', 'nearly', 'invisible', 'head-mic', 'playing', 'harp', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'use', 'enormous', 'hand', 'mic', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'other', 'start', 'Well', 'point', 'there', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'good', 'reason', 'point', 'out', 'anymore', 'screw-ups', 'believe', 'could', 'write', 'pages', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'end', 'negative', 'note', 'Orla', 'easily', 'top', 'twenty', 'list', 'favorite', 'singers', 'wish', 'best', 'suggestion', 'buy', 'DVD', 'anyway', 'not', 'perfect', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'yet', 'was', 'Orla', 'delight', 'listen', 'even', 'video', 'not', 'what', 'hoped', 'tried', 'give', 'good', 'show', 'who', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'lowered', 'expectations', 'will', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'it.In', 'case', 'Do', 'buy', 'CD', 'have', ""n't"", 'written', 'review', 'yet', 'worth', '4', 'stars', '[', 'comments', 'are', 'always', 'welcome', ']']",Orla Fallon's Celtic Christmas
1397430,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B004DQMSM0,Gary P. Cohen,"[13, 13]","I've been a big fan of Celtic Woman for the last 4 years.  And Orla Fallon was always one of my favorites.  When she left I was greatly disappointed.  Perhaps it was because she always seemed so quiet and reserved or perhaps because she has always had one of the softer voices of the girls but I never expected her to have such a thriving career since leaving the group.  Her first CD released after leaving the group was very good (see my previous Amazon review) and her wonderful Christmas special reviewed here was excellent.  While I am not a Christian and do not celebrate Christmas, I still love much of the music and the trappings of the holiday.  When this special was shown on PBS two weeks ago, I watched it.  After that I almost immediately ordered the CD and DVD.Orla is such a lovely, classy woman and I greatly enjoy the way she moves on stage.  This special, filmed in September in Nashville, has Orla on stage backed up by a very good choir and orchestra.  She has several guest stars including former Celtic Woman, Meav, whose voice is as lovely as ever.  It is wonderful to see her and Orla together on stage again and the audience really loved it. On several of the songs Orla accompanies herself on her trademark harp.  There are several Christmas standards including ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,"" ""Joy to the World,"" ""Little Drummer Boy,"" etc.  There are also several very good songs that I had not heard before.  My only slight disappointment was that I was expecting backstage interviews.  If they were there, I could not find them.All in all a very enjoyable special that I am sure I will enjoy for many holiday seasons to come.",4,Very Enjoyable,1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,1664,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'last', '4', 'years', 'Orla', 'Fallon', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'favorites', 'When', 'left', 'was', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'always', 'seemed', 'so', 'quiet', 'reserved', 'perhaps', 'always', 'had', 'one', 'softer', 'voices', 'girls', 'never', 'expected', 'have', 'thriving', 'career', 'leaving', 'group', 'first', 'CD', 'released', 'leaving', 'group', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'see', 'previous', 'Amazon', 'review', 'wonderful', 'Christmas', 'special', 'reviewed', 'here', 'was', 'excellent', 'am', 'not', 'Christian', 'do', 'not', 'celebrate', 'Christmas', 'still', 'love', 'much', 'music', 'trappings', 'holiday', 'When', 'special', 'was', 'shown', 'PBS', 'two', 'weeks', 'ago', 'watched', 'almost', 'immediately', 'ordered', 'CD', 'DVD.Orla', 'such', 'lovely', 'classy', 'woman', 'greatly', 'enjoy', 'way', 'stage', 'special', 'filmed', 'September', 'Nashville', 'Orla', 'stage', 'backed', 'up', 'very', 'good', 'choir', 'orchestra', 'several', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'former', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'Meav', 'voice', 'as', 'lovely', 'ever', 'wonderful', 'see', 'Orla', 'together', 'stage', 'again', 'audience', 'really', 'loved', 'several', 'songs', 'Orla', 'trademark', 'harp', 'are', 'several', 'Christmas', 'standards', 'including', 'Have', 'Merry', 'Little', 'Christmas', 'Joy', 'World', 'Little', 'Drummer', 'Boy', 'etc', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'very', 'good', 'songs', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'only', 'slight', 'disappointment', 'was', 'was', 'expecting', 'backstage', 'interviews', 'were', 'there', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'them.All', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'special', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'many', 'holiday', 'seasons', 'come']",Orla Fallon's Celtic Christmas
