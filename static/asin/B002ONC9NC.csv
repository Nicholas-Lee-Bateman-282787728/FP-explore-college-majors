The actors do a good job in this movie, but the plot details are so ridiculously unrealistic, I couldn't take this movie seriously at all.  What parents would allow their high-school-age daughter to go out to a concert and dinner with a much older man about whom they know nothing? To take her away on weekends even to a foreign country?  No parent in the world, that's who.  Additionally, the plot fails to motivate why such a worldly older man would be interested in a bookish, thoroughly average-looking schoolgirl.  It just doesn't hang together and the entire thing is sewn together with a very thick thread.  Not worth the time except if you are willing to suspend any belief.",1,Terrible; completely unrealistic plot.,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,726,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'mini', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'here', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'plot', 'details', 'are', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'unrealistic', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'movie', 'seriously', 'What', 'parents', 'would', 'allow', 'high-school-age', 'daughter', 'go', 'out', 'concert', 'dinner', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'whom', 'know', 'nothing', 'take', 'away', 'weekends', 'even', 'foreign', 'country', 'parent', 'world', 'who', 'Additionally', 'plot', 'motivate', 'why', 'such', 'worldly', 'older', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'bookish', 'thoroughly', 'average-looking', 'schoolgirl', 'just', ""n't"", 'hang', 'together', 'entire', 'thing', 'sewn', 'together', 'very', 'thick', 'thread', 'Not', 'time', 'are', 'willing', 'suspend', 'belief']",N/A

1281337,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B002ONC9NC,Amit Talpade,"[1, 1]","The movie is set in 1961, a year before Beatlemania sweeps the world. It features Jenny, an above average girl in a school trying to get admission to Oxford. She finds her surroundings stifling, her peers' average and yearns for a life when she can travel at will and enjoy artistic and literary pursuits. She meets an older guy and is attracted to him. The movie details this union and its eventual conclusion. I liked the movie a lot even though found some of the situations a bit puzzling and they were the scenes that involved her parents, how on earth did they get taken by this stranger that they allowed their daughter to go out on dates with a much older man. I also found surprising the fact that her school never got involved more deeply and kept the parents uniformed about the affair. I guess this is a movie and such artistic liberties are normal but it could have happened because the script by Nick Hornby is based on a memoir.The leads acted well and I particularly liked her father played by Alfred Molina, who wants his daughter to move up the social ladder so badly that he is willing to do anything for that. Peter Sarsgaard is amazing as the much older man who falls in love with a younger girl; none of his actions suggest that he has any guilt. I thought the movie was directed well with above average performance including the lead Carey Mulligan, who was simply superb as Jenny. I gave it three and half stars. 9/24/10",4,An Education in Life,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,1443,"['movie', 'set', '1961', 'year', 'Beatlemania', 'sweeps', 'world', 'Jenny', 'above', 'average', 'girl', 'school', 'trying', 'get', 'admission', 'Oxford', 'surroundings', 'stifling', 'peers', 'average', 'yearns', 'life', 'when', 'can', 'travel', 'will', 'enjoy', 'artistic', 'literary', 'pursuits', 'older', 'guy', 'attracted', 'movie', 'details', 'union', 'eventual', 'conclusion', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'even', 'found', 'situations', 'bit', 'puzzling', 'were', 'scenes', 'involved', 'parents', 'how', 'earth', 'did', 'get', 'taken', 'stranger', 'allowed', 'daughter', 'go', 'out', 'dates', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'also', 'found', 'surprising', 'fact', 'school', 'never', 'got', 'involved', 'more', 'deeply', 'kept', 'parents', 'uniformed', 'affair', 'guess', 'movie', 'such', 'artistic', 'liberties', 'are', 'normal', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'script', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'based', 'memoir.The', 'leads', 'acted', 'well', 'particularly', 'liked', 'father', 'played', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'who', 'daughter', 'move', 'up', 'social', 'ladder', 'so', 'badly', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'amazing', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'younger', 'girl', 'none', 'actions', 'suggest', 'guilt', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'well', 'above', 'average', 'performance', 'including', 'lead', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'who', 'was', 'simply', 'superb', 'Jenny', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', '9/24/10']",N/A
1281338,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B002ONC9NC,Andrew Desmond,"[2, 3]","""An Education"" is a coming of age film set in London in 1961.  It centres on the life of Jenny (Carey Mulligan), an almost precociously bright middle class high school girl, whose father has expectations of her attending Oxford to read English.  However, even the sometimes best made plans can come unstuck.Jenny falls into the orbit of David Goldman (Peter Sarsgaard) who is probably twice her age but extremely beguiling.  His world is one of money and good times although the means of raising this money is, at best, marginal and, at worst, criminal.  Jenny chooses to ignore these facts as she falls for the trappings of the lifestyle.  Slowly, her studies fall by the way side until she eventually walks out from school as David's fianc&eacute;e.  She soon learns, however, that David has a secret he hasn't shared with her.  It is this secret that conflicts the relationship.  Jenny is left without an education and a very bleak future.  But she is made of sterner stuff.This is an excellent film.  Carey Mulligan deserves an Oscar nomination.  She is wonderfully supported by Alfred Molina as her nave father, Emma Thompson as the overly stern school principal and Olivia Williams as the genuinely concerned teacher.  Each plays a marvellous supporting role.I recommend ""An Education"" unreservedly.

1281339,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ONC9NC,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 6]","I saw that you didn't respond to my recent comment on you scathing review of this film, and so I thought that I'd go ahead and elaborate on my feelings on the film to you in a letter.  I know that my initial comment on your review may have seemed rather harsh, but I was simply stating my perception of your viewpoint.  I know that everyone is entitled to their opinions, and I respect that (as I would hope that others on here would respect my own) but your review struck me as one that entirely missed the point of the film, and when I said that I felt you were `looking for reasons to tear it apart' I meant that, and I'll explain why now.I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to `quote' you here, and then elaborate on my personal feelings.I'm going to start by yelling SPOILERS.  There are many people (myself included) who read reviews on this site to better understand whether or not they are truly interested in even watching a certain film, and so to give away the entire plot without giving a heads-up first is just not right.I find it odd that you make the statement ""For starters, when we're introduced to the protagonist, high school student Jenny, she seems way too sophisticated for a 16 year old..."" and then make a contradictory statement a few paragraphs down when you say ""Perhaps the moment I found to be the most incredulous was Jenny's sudden transformation from earnest student to unsavory bad girl. Even with the father acting the way he did, would she have so suddenly embraced David once she discovers that he's a con artist? I would think that a normal teenager would have been very alarmed that she was now in the company of a bunch of criminals and fear would have entered into the equation. But what was Jenny's reaction? A mild protest and then David sweeps her off her feet.""  Teenagers have the natural born tendency to rebel.  Jenny is a smart and studious young woman who has been pushed and prodded by her parents (her father especially) to soak up her education at the expense of a social life.  While she displays a sharp hesitation upon discovering her boyfriends little hobby, she is still completely under his charm and that element of danger excites her.  She has already shown that this is the case (she is readily lying to and hiding things from her parents).  You have to understand that this is completely new to Jenny, and it carries with it an air of excitement that she is not used to.  David is handsome and charming and funny and apparently wealthy and this is all something that brings Jenny a flutter in her stomach she doesn't want to see go away.  So, maybe she is a little apprehensive about his choices, and she doesn't agree with them, but in her mind his seemingly good qualities outweigh this little indiscretion.Next I'll address your statement that ""The main problem is that Carey Mulligan, who plays Jenny, is 24 years old in real life. Why didn't they cast a teenager?"".  For me, this was `looking for something to tear at'.  They very rarely cast teenagers in roles as teenagers.  Most films you see where high-school is depicted, the actors are all in their 20's.  In fact, Rachel McAdams is in her 30's and yet just 5 years ago she played a teenager in `Mean Girls'.Now we have your interpretation of Jenny's father, Jack.  To `quote you', you say ""At first he appears extremely petulant, a caricature of the pushy parent who wants their child to succeed at any cost. With his insistence that Jenny study night and day in order to get into Oxford, we're first led to believe that he's the film's antagonist.""  While I don't agree on that caricature part, I understand your feelings here, so I'm not going to pounce on them.  The character of Jack is not really new to cinema, and his eccentric behavior can be perceived as over-acting or hammy.  I get that, but I don't agree, and here is why.  Jack is not very respected, at least not to the degree he would like to be.  Both his daughter and his wife challenge his authority in many scenes, and so his over exertion is more a defense mechanism.  He uses his loud voice and faux authoritative stance as a way to compensate for his feelings of inadequacy.  Understanding this avenue of his personality will make it easier to reason out your next complaint.  You say ""he's so easily taken in by David's scheme--that David is actually an Oxford alumni and knows famous Oxford professor/author C.S Lewis. If this was a real character, wouldn't have Jack made a few simple inquiries to determine whether David was telling the truth or not?"".  Jack fears that he will be taken as a lesser man than this charming older gentleman who has taken an interest in his daughter, and so while he may not understand completely he fakes it so as to feel (and appear) as though he is an equal.  Another thing to keep in mind is the time period in which this film takes place.  Sure, it may seem like bad parenting to us today, but having an educated and wealthy older gentleman take an interest in your young daughter was something truly prized then (and to a degree, it is prized today) so the parents blind eye so-to-speak is not really that ridiculous.Now, let's look at David.  You state this as your complaint: ""David was disappointing in that he was such a tame sociopath. What are his crimes?"".  My problem with this accusation is that David isn't really a sociopath.  You have to remember that this is a true story (surely embellished) and that in real life people make these kinds of mistakes.  The reveal of David's personality and his actions feels honest.  Sure, they may not be BIG mistakes compared to the fictitious ones generated by Hollywood, but they are honest and truly devastating, especially to a sixteen-year-old.  David was a foolish and impulsive man who was obviously unhappy with his life and found a sense of solace in young girls, but I do feel that his feelings for Jenny, while initially selfish, were genuine by the films end.He wasn't a sociopath, he was a human being.Next you attack his friends by saying ""Equally disappointing is the couple he hangs out with--except for one scene where there is a confrontation with Jenny, they really have little to do.""  They are there to represent a certain lifestyle and culture, and they do that effortlessly (especially Pike, who is a glorious supporting playing in this film, showing an earned understanding of her place in her man's life).This point especially got me.  You state, regarding the headmistress, ""After she finds out David is Jewish, she blurts out that the Jews ""killed our Lord"". Not only is she depicted as a vile anti-Semite but she cruelly rejects Jenny's request to be reinstated.""  Again, `LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO TEAR AT'.  She was a woman of the times, and a very strong woman at that.  Her viewpoint regarding the Jews was not an uncommon one and so the film shouldn't be attacked for portraying her in a way that felt authentic, and her rejecting Jenny's request shouldn't be looked at as tyrannical in any way.  She had to uphold a sense of justice, and she had to set an example for the other girls who may have been influenced by Jenny's indiscretion.  Jenny was not a bad girl by any means, but she was foolish and there are consequences to be paid.That is life.Well, that is about all I have to say in rebuttal, so I'm going to generate my own review now.  With all that I have already said, I will keep this briefer than usual.For me, `An Education' is one of the better films to come out this year (of Oscars top ten `Best Picture' nominees, it is my favorite).  The plot is swift and poignant, and while it doesn't really bend any rules or go anywhere different than the norm, it does everything other films have done, only better.  The acting is probably my favorite aspect of the film (Mulligan's natural and delightfully sincere portrayal of young Jenny is the best of the year, bar none, and quite frankly one of the, if not THE, best of the decade).  I also adored Rosamond Pike and Olivia Williams and Alfred Molina and Dominic Cooper, and while Sarsgaard (a personal favorite of mine) is not best in show, he is remarkable astute to his characters development.  I personally don't understand those who criticize Sarsgaard for playing David as a creep.  We are supposed to see the shifty eyes, but are supposed to be duped but the charm.We are.The elements of this film all come together nicely to create a crisp and colorful package that is as technically engaging (from the posh night clubs to the authentic classrooms to the stunning cinematography, tantalizing score and delicious costumes) as it is emotionally stimulating.  The film, for me, plays with the subtlety very nicely, allowing us to sink into each scene as if we were right there, the characters slowing unveiling themselves so that we are never forced their transformation but allowed to witness it in gradual, and honest, progression.This is an odd review for me, but I hope that it was helpful to some and at least interesting for all.  Turfseer, I hope you understand that I am not trying to target you or attack you.  You are entitled to your opinion, but you challenged me to debate you here (your exact words were ""I noticed that you offered no arguments in defense of your position that 'An Education' was a good film. You are of course entitled to do so and I would be interested to hear them."") and so I decided to take you up on the challenge.Sincerely,Andrew Ellington",5,"Dear Turfseer,",1266278400,"02 16,

But the subject matter, despite being (purportedly) true, was not at my comfort level. It was unsavory, as another reviewer said. I kind of felt like I needed to take a shower afterwards, despite the fact that there was nothing sexually explicit in the movie.I found it unrealistic that Jenny's parents allowed her relationship to go on, even though Lynn Barber explained how this happened and how her parents were enamored with the sleazy David. (David, played charismatically by Peter Sarsgaard, is not nearly sleazy enough and certainly does not fit the description given by Barber).I suppose this could be labelled a ""coming of age"" movie, but it is one that I found rather bleak. As someone who is the same age as Barber, I cannot imagine anyone whom I knew in 1960 falling for this kind of seduction by a man twice her age. Nor did I ever know any parents who would have permitted such a thing this to go on. I almost hate to mention this, but I wonder how carefully Barber's memoir was vetted for authenticity? I am well-known by my friends for having a healthy skepticism about memoirs, and this one is no different.

I wish I could say I connected with it, because its a very well made film, but unfortunately the story just didn't appeal to me. It's basically a coming-of-age story about a 16-year old British girl in the 1960s. It just wasn't an interesting enough story for me. I give the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, because it has beautiful cinematography, good acting, great production design, and solid music. For those that connect with the story, you'll probably rate this film higher. I heard about An Education through the end-of-year awards pipeline back in 2009. It was nominated for 3 Oscars, including Best Picture. Actor Carey Mulligan leads the strong supporting cast and her role in this film led to her roles in Never Let Me Go (2010) and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), where she shines even more so than here in my opinion. A similar but better recent coming-of-age story from a similar time period is Nowhere Boy (2010), starring Aaron Johnson as the young John Lennon before The Beatles.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 2]","I don't want to start out with a negative tone about AN EDUCATION, but I just can't help myself!The thing that draws me into a movie is mainly the unexpected. Give me, too, some good character and a good story and I'm hooked. But An Education gave me only the characters. The story was completely predictable. It is, at its core, a coming of age story. And its one that we've all seen before.There's nothing remotely challenging for the viewer to follow. That doesn't mean I take ANYTHING away from Peter Sarsgaard (Jarhead) as the handsome, witty, and alarmingly charming David. Nor can I say anything remotely bad about Carey Mulligan (Pride & Prejudice) as the smart but inexperienced Jenny. When these two characters collide, sparks certainly fly. But they aren't unexpected. Or in any way surprising.When we meet David (Sarsgaard) we immediately know that a guy this age should not be philandering around with a sixteen-year-old school girl. And I guessed much of what was to come long before it was revealed (no spoilers). I also knew how Jenny would react. She's an amazingly smart young lady, so her ability to handle this situation wasn't shocking at all.Some people have commented on the supporting cast, especially Emma Thompson (Harry Potterseries) as the Headmistress. But I didn't find her character intimidating or interesting. However, I did find Olivia Williams (X-Men) as Jenny's English instructor a very interesting character. She had a profound impact on Jenny's life (pre- and post-David).The remainder of the cast were fairly forgettable with only minor flashes of importance and interest that rapidly dissipated.Let me say again that I found the two main characters very entertaining, but the story far too predictable to give a high rating. I am, however, happy that I saw the film. Most of the award nominations and wins were directed at Carey Mulligan, and I felt that was completely justified.Too bad the rest of the film couldn't hold up to the actors' performances.",3,Predictable But With Good Acting,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,1995,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'start', 'out', 'negative', 'tone', 'AN', 'EDUCATION', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'myself', 'thing', 'movie', 'mainly', 'unexpected', 'Give', 'too', 'good', 'character', 'good', 'story', ""'m"", 'hooked', 'Education', 'gave', 'only', 'characters', 'story', 'was', 'completely', 'predictable', 'core', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'challenging', 'viewer', 'follow', ""n't"", 'mean', 'take', 'away', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Jarhead', 'handsome', 'witty', 'alarmingly', 'charming', 'David', 'can', 'say', 'anything', 'remotely', 'bad', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'smart', 'inexperienced', 'Jenny', 'When', 'two', 'characters', 'collide', 'certainly', 'fly', 'are', ""n't"", 'unexpected', 'way', 'surprising.When', 'meet', 'David', 'Sarsgaard', 'immediately', 'know', 'guy', 'age', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'philandering', 'sixteen-year-old', 'school', 'girl', 'guessed', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'long', 'was', 'revealed', 'spoilers', 'also', 'knew', 'how', 'Jenny', 'would', 'react', 'amazingly', 'smart', 'young', 'lady', 'ability', 'handle', 'situation', 'was', ""n't"", 'shocking', 'all.Some', 'people', 'have', 'commented', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Harry', 'Potterseries', 'Headmistress', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'character', 'intimidating', 'interesting', 'However', 'did', 'find', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'X-Men', 'Jenny', 'English', 'instructor', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'had', 'profound', 'impact', 'Jenny', 'life', 'pre-', 'post-David', '.The', 'remainder', 'cast', 'were', 'fairly', 'forgettable', 'only', 'minor', 'flashes', 'importance', 'interest', 'rapidly', 'dissipated.Let', 'say', 'again', 'found', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'very', 'entertaining', 'story', 'far', 'too', 'predictable', 'give', 'high', 'rating', 'am', 'however', 'happy', 'saw', 'film', 'Most', 'award', 'nominations', 'wins', 'were', 'directed', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'felt', 'was', 'completely', 'justified.Too', 'bad', 'rest', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'actors', 'performances']",N/A

One was what did the lead con-man( in his 30's) really want from the 16 year old girl? He made quite an effort showing her a good time, and his ""affection"", but it was never revealed why. The others in the con artists team were clearly in on the con but the director of the move neglected to let the audience in on it too! Another issue I had was the over-protective father who barely put up a fight when the con artist offered to take his daughter away far from home. I know he's a ""con artist"" and all but still!

1281345,A3NO9TSFVL1ZJD,B002ONC9NC,Bosco Hoggins,"[10, 14]","I just saw An Education last night after waiting until it came onto DVD and Oscar hype had subsided.  I enjoyed it and thought that it was pretty solid for the first 95% of the movie.  However, I can't give an unqualified recommendation.  Here are my general impressions:(i) ActingCarey Mulligan needs to go over to Sandra Bullock's place to retrieve her Oscar. The travesty of Bullock's win for The Blind Side over Ms. Mulligan's subtle and sad, yet vivacious and spirited performance has made me question my conception of the universe - There is simply no conceivable way that a just and loving God could allow such an outrage to his creation.  Mulligan is an absolute star, transitioning throughout the film from an obedient but questioning schoolgirl to a rebellious adventurer to a devastated young woman.  I believed every step and found myself throughout thinking ""Yes, that is how a young woman in that situation would act.""  Her internal conflict between pain, stubborn pride, naivety, ambition, and rebellion are just wrenching.  I will say it now: Carey Mulligan is the finest actress of her generation, bar none.Peter Sarsgaard was great, as usual.  I spoke with my mother after we both independently watched this movie.  She said that, based on his character in An Education, she would never be able to watch another film with him again.  His character was just so despicable that she could never again see him on screen without reawakening her disgust and loathing.  I wouldn't go as far as that, but thought it spoke volumes about the power of his performance.There are other noteworthy performances:  Olivia Williams, Alfred Molina, and (an effective, but underutilized) Emma Thompson.  Finally, here is a sentence that won't be repeated soon: Rosamund Pike (the bad guy from Die Another Day) was pretty darn good too.(ii) Story and ScriptThe plot and the dialogue were both good.  I have to admit that Nick Hornsby generally drives me a little crazy.  Among other works, I read High Fidelity and saw About a Boy and my impression has always been that he tries too hard to be hip and quirky and spends a lot of time trying to convince his readers/audience how cool he is.  It's an affliction of many authors of his generation (I think the medical term is Brett Easton Ellis Syndrome) and it drives me absolutely batty.  Surprisingly, he did dial it back for the most part in this one and, notwithstanding an unfortunate monologue near the end by Mr. Molina, limited the ham-handedness of much of the script.The big problem that I had with the movie was that the last ten minutes of the movie really compromises the first ninety.  I will give you a SPOILER WARNING right here, though if you know anything about the movie, nothing here should be too big a revelation.  The major theme of the movie is a clever, but sheltered young woman gets mixed up with an older man, who despite his surface sophistication, turns out to be not only a conman, but also much more sinister.  The progression of the story is how this girl is drawn step by step into his web while rejecting the premises that have driven her life up to their meeting.  The real narrative force of the movie is the battle between her beliefs in received values (i.e. ambition and independence) and her need to venture beyond the limits prescribed by her life, her family, and, indeed, by her society.  Her intellect heightens both sides of this conflict, justifying her ambitions while simultaneously amplifying the rebellion against them.  In the long run, her pride wins out to disastrous consequence, leaving her cheated of the fruits of either.  If the movie had ended there, it would have been a devastating, poignant story.  However, the actual end of the movie (actually really the last five to ten minutes), turns the whole conflict on its head.(iii) The EndInstead of having paid the consequences for her choice, it turns out that, oh well, everything turns out peaches regardless.  It brought two thoughts to mind:First, there is an episode of the show, ""The Simpsons"" where all the schoolchildren get stuck on an island and spend the episode trying to find a way to survive and form a society (yes, it was take-off of Lord of the Flies).  They struggle and fight and look for a way home to no avail.  Right as the show is ending with the children still stuck on the island, the narrator says, ""Oh, yeah.... The children were rescued by, let's say, Moe"".  The irony being that everything up to that point was pointless... Just wrap the thing up however.Second, I have this visualization of some seedy Hollywood producer taking a look at an early cut and spitting out a profanity-laced tirade: ""Don't you know chicks are going to see this and that chicks hate sad endings?  I don't want you coming back until you frou-frou up the ending, got it?  This is going to be my biggest hit since The Scarlet Letter.""*The point being that any kind of emotional investment that you have in this character and this story (and for me it was good deal) is just undermined by this trite ending.  Why did it matter which road she took throughout the rest of the movie if they all led to the same place?  Why should a viewer care about the betrayal that was meticulously built throughout the rest of the movie if there are really no consequences anyway?  It just seemed lazy and pandering to me and made me sorry that I had taken the rest of the movie seriously.ConclusionNotwithstanding the three stars, I would recommend this movie if for nothing else for the acting.  However, I would warn against taking the plot too seriously; you will just be betrayed.*As a personal note, I've never forgiven Gary Oldman for that one.",3,What a Betrayal!!!,1274054400,"05 17,

1281347,AKUIYX3PU2PJL,B002ONC9NC,Carmen Ferreiro-Esteban,"[2, 2]","Based on a memoir by British journalist Lynn Barber, An Education is the story of a 16 year old girl living in 1961 London with her traditional middle-class parents.Smart and witted Jenny, who speaks French, plays cello, and has just won a scholarship to go to Oxford envisions life on her own terms.

And when he proposes marriage, she accepts him, more than willing to forfeit her education for the glamorous life he seems to be offering her.There is a catch though, as David is not who he pretends to be, and Jenny is, unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, forced back to redefine her life by herself.Despite the dark undercurrent of deceit, An Education is an enchanting story about falling in love and growing up, played with charming conviction by Carey Mulligan, who received a best actress Oscar nomination for her role.

This girl is 16 when she meets him and he is in his late 30s. It is set in the early-middle 1960s and the girl is aspiring to go to Oxford.  However, she finds it dreary that a hard academic life will lead to a rather dull career in teaching or government work.  So dates to concerts, fine restaurants, jazz clubs and eventually trips to Oxford and Paris turn her head.  Carey Mulligan and Peter Saarsgard are outstanding as the couple.  I've always admired Saarsgard's ability to become just about anyone and he certainly does it again here, even becoming believably English (he does not play an American in England, which is the way this is usually done).The parents are very good too, especially Alfred Molina as her father.  I can now see how this situation could happen. I don't think everyone's parents would give in to the older man. However, with these two, I can see they are easily conned, stolid middle class folks who have never been up against this level of charm and finesse before.  I expected to find them contemptible but did not.  I expected to find her dopey and did not.  Saarsgard's character is complex.  I would like to say I detested him but I ended up wanting to know more, especially how he came to be the way he is.This is a highly volatile issue, especially in America, an adult being sexually active with a minor.  One must keep a few things in mind though.  First, this is set roughly fifty years ago, when a lot of young women married fresh out of high school and their other horizons were limited.  Second, the parents and the girl are seduced into this but it is not like everyone around them is in favor of this.  There are plenty of outraged people who take a stand, especially her teacher and headmistress.  Third, in the real life situations I've seen develop and in this film one, the man is always affluent.  This factor always seems to a deciding one, tipping the scales towards him.I did not think this was a permissive or tolerant movie about this situation, as some people have claimed.  In fact, it might be a good wakeup call for a lot of parents to see this.

Carey Mulligan is nominated for a Golden Globe for best actress (and many other acting awards). The entire cast is nominated for the Screen Actors Guild award.The barest of plot details: The film is set outside London in 1962. Jenny (Carey Mulligan) is sixteen, and one of the brightest students at her private girl's school. She wants to go to Oxford to read English literature. She meets a charming, friendly, older man.This film is perhaps the perfect coming of age story. Yes, I realize what a strong statement that is. Lynn Barber's story is not necessarily unique, yet it is a product of the time she was raised. Still, as someone who came of age in the 1990's United States rather than the 1960's Britain, it could have been my story. It is the perfect coming of age story because this dichotomy between uniqueness and everywoman-ness.Carey Mulligan is fantastic, but Peter Sarsgaard was mesmerizing. He completely nailed the British accent; I immediately checked [...] to see if he was, in fact, British. The entire cast is amazing, and the casting director deserves kudos as well. Rarely does one see a cast without a weak link. It's easily the best movie I've seen this year, and although there is some hesitation to such a bold statement, it is one of my favorite movies of all time. I'll see how well it stand up with time and multiple viewings, but this one is a modern classic. It's brilliant, moving, funny (Nick Hornby, remember) and immensely watchable and re-watchable.

You end up restless and bored much of the time and that, in combination with hormones, can cause you to sometimes do some very, very stupid things.That's the situation Jenny (Oscar-nominated Carey Mulligan, best known to me from her role as Sally Sparrow), is in in An Education, the Oscar-nominated movie from director Lone Scherfig and writer Nick Hornby (known for such works as About a Boy. Watch it and realize that pudgy little boy grew up to be, oh, quite lovely). She's very much fed up with her life and when she meets an older man, David (played by the always reliable Peter Sarsgaard), who gives her the respect and attention no one else does.From the start it's pretty clear what David wants from her, and it's quite clear Jenny is at least somewhat aware of this. She seems to be willing to go along with that in return for the gifts, the activities and a chance to be around people who are more ""her sort"".David is a charming fellow, even able to get Jenny's parents to accept him and allow her to do things like accompany him to Oxford or Paris. Her father (played by the always reliable Alfred Molina), appears to be completely snowed. Her mother less so, though she's still willing to let her daughter go off with this man in his 30's.David's charms are somewhat undone when Jenny finds out the various ways he makes a living, which include, but are not limited to, stealing valuable art from old women. Surprisingly, she's willing to go along with this, but eventually finds out something even more dark and unpleasant about David.The film is intelligent and entertaining and paints David in a surprisingly sympathetic light until towards the very end. I say ""surprisingly"" because do let's remember Jenny is a minor and what he does with her is what's described as ""statutory rape"" in many places and is even called ""rape of a child"" in others. Of course this fact isn't really addressed, but it was always there in the back of my mind.I also found the character of Jenny to be delightful! Very smart, very charismatic, but also vulnerable and not quite as world-weary as she likes to think of herself as being. Her character, and indeed the entire story, is based on a memoir by journalist Lynn Barber. If there's more about Barber's life that she can turn into stories, I'd enjoy that. I'd like to see Jenny again.It's somewhat hard to classify this movie. It's not a comedy, it's not a drama. It's certainly not a romantic comedy. It probably fits into that tired non-genre genre of ""coming of age"".

Sixteen year old Jenny lives with her parents just outside of London and has dreams of going to Oxford. it's hard to say if the dream is hers or her father's, but regardless, she works hard to get good grades and do well on her exams so the dream can become reality. She leads a very stable, suburban life: goes to school, plays cello, has a small but solid group of girlfriends and gets along well enough with her parents. She's also very pretty.I think that is one aspect of the movie that is, perhaps, the most important. In the 1960s women did not yet have open access in to many careers. So much hinged on their looks. Unattractive and you could count on a life of working as a teacher and living alone. Attractive and you strived (and I think that is the right word) to find yourself a man to take care of you, thereby relinquishing you of any duties to work outside of the home (and, if you were very lucky, maybe not even inside the home). But if you found that balance of pretty and smart, then you had a few more options available to you. You could make decisions in your destiny. Rotten decisions by today's standards, but decisions nonetheless.Jenny fell into this last group of girls.One day Jenny meets David Goldman, a man over twice her age. David goes out of his way to show Jenny and her family that his interest in her is not improper and that he wants solely to expose her to cultural activities which she enjoys. (As a viewer, you quickly know that he is slick, and his interest is quite improper.) And as the plot develops, Jenny has decisions to make that are slightly outside of the slim pickings normally presented to girls of her ilk.I enjoyed An Education quite a bit. I think it would be ridiculous if it won Best Picture because it was simply not good enough to warrant that amount of praise. There was no backstory to the movie, no build up to the plot.

Prodded by her parents to study hard and take cello, they dream of her acceptance to Oxford University and becoming financially secure.  A top student, she desperately wants to break out of her routine and, instead, attend concerts, art galleries, and experience more of the world. Her parents feel otherwise.  One rainy day, a handsome, older man named David (Peter Sarsgaard) drives up and offers her a lift home.  David is a student of life.  He attracts and fascinates her, and what starts innocently as an unlikely friendship develops into a deeper relationship.  He is adept at charming her parents into letting her exceed her curfew and boundaries, and Jenny gets to go to an art auction, Oxford campus, and in time, even a romantic Paris getaway complete with a sunset by the River Seine.Despite the overtures of a fellow student, Graham, he is no match for the sophisticated, mature, and apparently wealthy David.  Jenny becomes self assured and even insubordinate to her teachers and principal despite their warnings and protestations.  She revels in her new life with David and his carefree friends Danny and Helen, and the foursome venture into the night for partying and taking in the highlife.  As romance deepens and her defiance of authority and protocol increases, can marriage be far behind, and how will Jenny's parents react?David is a mystery as are his motives.  What does he do for a living, and is he for real?  Perhaps his carefree life is not as glamorous as it seems.  As Jenny finds out, life can be full of joy and surprises, and one moment she can be master of her own fate and the next instant everything could come shattering down around her.  As much as her world has broadened and expanded, she also learns about humility and contrition.  Such is the education of a girl learning about herself at a crucial moment in her life.Director Lone Scherfig does a splendid job of telling a coming of age tale that hits the right notes.  What this film does well is to put us inside the head of Jenny.  We feel her yearnings and frustrations.  We experience her highs and exhilaration at finding a life beyond her home.  We also hurt when morality is twisted and she is disappointed and betrayed.  That's not just good writing (which it really is); it's a well directed ensemble of talented actors starting with Mulligan. Production values are modest, but the period costumes and background music are infectious and authentic.Sarsgaard (Kinsey, Jarhead) is quite magnetic as the manipulative David and inflects a convincing British accent.  His scenes with Mulligan are affecting and sustain interest.  Alfred Molina is good as Jenny's stern father, while Emma Thompson is on too briefly as a proper school principal.  Olivia Williams is effective as a teacher who will play a significant role in Jenny's future.Aside from its portrayal of a teenager, the film depicts the apparently limited options for a graduating female at the time.  She either could excel academically and get a job, or she could find a husband who could take care of her.  It is interesting how Jenny's parents are motivated by this mode of thinking and how it guides their actions.  There is an aspect to the story which borders on statutory laws regarding sex with a girl who is barely of adult age.  The storytellers finesse their way around this and focus on the relationship and do a tasteful job in minimizing the lurid possibilities.  Subtle hints of racism are folded into the narrative, this being the 1960's.In the end, it is Carey Mulligan in a star making turn as the idealistic teen who matures ahead of her own time and learns about life the hard way.

1281362,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B002ONC9NC,Doug Anderson,"[3, 7]","The year is 1961. Sixteen year-old Jenny (played by 24 year-old Carey Mulligan) is the star pupil in her English class and entertains hopes of one day attending Oxford college. This hope is encouraged by her teachers (one of which is played by the beautiful Olivia Williams who here downplays her beauty with plain clothes, no make-up, school marm bun, and thick glasses) and her parents and so her days are spent studying for exams. In her spare moments Jenny reads French literature and listens to French records. Jenny has no real problems or conflicts; she has supportive parents and teachers, talent, and plenty of friends.  However, being an imaginative creature with tastes beyond her years, Jenny finds her routine suburban life of school and study dull. And like many teenagers, precocious or not, she feels stifled by those who only want the best for her. Only one boy expresses interest in her and he is an immature and restless dreamer who wants to travel to mainland Europe (not unlike Jenny herself)but he can never find the right thing or anything to say and he bores the very articulate and quick-witted Jenny. One day while Jenny waits for a bus in the rain a stranger (Peter Sarsgaard) offers to give her a lift. Because he can actually hold an adult conversation and thus her attention, Jenny is attracted to the much older David. When he asks her out several days later, she eagerly accepts.The film is based on a memoir by Lynn Barber and adapted for screen by Barber and Nick Hornby (who is best known for his novel High Fidelity). Danish director Lone Scherfig has an eye for period details (cars, fashion, furnishings) that give this film an authenticity often lacking in many other period films. This year--situated as it is at the beginning of one of the most transformative decades in western history--seems to be a particularly well chosen one in which to set this portrait of Jenny and middle-class English society since both are just beginning to test the waters of those changes to come. This transitional moment (in that limbo between 1950's conservatism and 1960's liberalism) seems to be getting a lot of attention in film of late. I suspect this is because this tension between conservative traditionalism and permissive liberalism is still being played out in our personal and social lives. We have plenty of films that criticize the 1950's for being stifling, kitschy, and counterfeit; and plenty of films that claim that the 1960's supposedly liberated us from those inauthentic and materialistic norms. What we don't have are many films that take a more measured look at this transitional period (just how much has the world changed and just how much have those pesky norms persisted?) or this transitional time in life (what exactly is an education?). This film takes a measured look at both.The cars, the furniture, the fashion, the jazz records, the paintings, the cigarettes at first appear to be there merely to provide background and atmosphere but of course background and atmosphere are important when they are the things that are seducing the main character. The real love story here is not between Jenny and David but between Jenny and culture. Thats what really creates and holds the viewer's interest, thats what's really being documented by Barber's memoir and this film. The real event of Jenny's seventeenth birthday is not the loss of her viriginity, but the contact she makes with live Jazz, and Paris (not the dream of it but the actual place): these are what she falls in love with ,and, consequently, what facilitate her rapidly evolving sense of self. Our characters are formed, Jenny's teachers and books say, from our experiences. However, the teachers themselves, Jenny is quick to note, do not appear to have had much firsthand experience of the world. Her teachers all try to warn Jenny about David because they all assume that the relationship is distracting her from what really matters, Oxford. But Jenny is still discovering what really matters to her. And she questions the value of an education that is so narrowly focused on book learning and the acquisition of advanced degrees. Certainly one thing that David introduces Jenny to is sexuality but of all the things that he introduces her to that is perhaps the least interesting to her. Sexuality--that much-heralded liberator of so many 1960's films--is all but absent from this film, the intimate scenes are brief non-events; sexuality, Jenny finds, is not much of a teacher, nor a liberator (the poets, it would seem to Jenny, have overstated the importance of the act). What Jenny really finds liberating is firsthand experience, and what experience teaches her is what matters most to her and what matters most to those around her. What she finds matters most to her parents is not education but financial security (hers and theirs); and what she finds matters most to her teachers is book learning and degrees. The only people that seem to really care about and value experience and living are David and his friends. She envies their experience-rich lives, and they envy her natural talents; it is a two-way seduction. It is experience that teaches Jenny who Jenny is which is the biggest lesson of her early life. It is also experience that teaches her to look with more sympathetic eyes on the lives of others, especially on her teacher Miss Stubbs.This brings me to what I thought was going to be a criticism of the film. At first I thought the film failed to develop Miss Stubbs and I thought this was a major flaw. But the more I think about it the more I suspect that this character is not undeveloped, just purposefully left ambiguous. In 1961 England an Oxford educated woman had two career options: teaching and civil service. The Miss Stubbs' role is therefore extremely important as Miss Stubbs represents the kind of future that is available to and awaits Jenny if she is indeed accepted to Oxford. When Jenny looks at Miss Stubbs she is therefore also in many ways eyeing her own future. At first Jenny perceives Miss Stubbs to be frumpy and sexless and sad but like all of her other perceptions in this film that perception shifts. For most of the film we see Miss Stubbs as Jenny does--a  schoolteacher with no personal life or identity apart from that role. When we finally do see her not at school but in her own home in her own clothes we see she is not exactly a beauty but not at all plain either. We do not know exactly what her life is like but we do know that she surrounds herself with the things she loves which happen to be the same things that Jenny loves. Since the Miss Stubbs character is left somewhat ambiguous, it is never made clear whether a life spent contemplating culture is a good life, a satisfying life, or not. It would seem that her life is highlighted by art but also lonely as it seems that she has no one to share those experiences with. Whether this is the life that Jenny sees herself living in ten or twenty years is unclear; what does seem clear is that both ""women"" (by films end Jenny does seem like she has begun to acquire the wisdom she has been seeking; by this films criteria it is wisdom and not sexuality that makes a woman) seem to have learned something from the other: Miss Stubbs, one suspects or at least hopes, will perhaps become more daring and seek connections with people and not just works of art, and Jenny will channel her curiousity and daring in more sophisticated and less naive ways.This is a quiet film that does not necessarily make a strong immediate impact, but that nonetheless resonates days after viewing.",4,Extremely Subtle and Detailed Portrait of a Young Lady and a Society,1258848000,"11 22,

1281363,AHPV4F8IVSC39,B002ONC9NC,"Douglas B. Moran ""Computer+History/Politics""","[16, 31]","-- AUDIENCE for this review --This review is from my perspective. Many people appreciate movies from entirely different perspectives and criteria--as witnessed by the many such reviews here--and such people are likely to find this review irrelevant to them.In watching movies, I have a strong character-oriented focus: Is what is happening reasonable for that character, versus being a message the writer or director wanted to make, but which is out-of-character for that character.  Here, none of the major characters were authentic to me.  I also focus on what the movie is actually showing, not just what it is saying.  If there is a conflict, or even disconnect, I become distrustful. If a movie fails badly in these aspects, it is difficult for it to have enough offsetting positives for _me_.-- REVIEW --This movie is from a chapter of a recently publishedmemoir of Lynn Barber(a famous British journalist) with the script adding many details.  Given the decades separating the events (in 1960) from the writing, a certain amount of re-interpretation, self-justification, blame-shifting and score-setting is to be expected, but what appears in the movie is far beyond what I was willing to accept/accommodate.First and foremost, the movie's Jenny (Carey Mulligan) never appears to be a 16/17 year-old from a newly middle-class family: She shows none of the physical awkwardness and lack of knowledge and experience. Neither does she show the expected reactions to being introduced to new experiences. Instead, the way the character moved in the scenes and responded to situations said to me that she was well into her 20s and at least upper middle class: She displays an ease navigating those environments that indicate years of experience plus a support system--family and close friends--also in that environment (her birthday party suggests she has no friends, only acquaintances). Recognize that precocious _interest_ alone does not produce _experience_, nor does book learning and quick tutorials provide much of a jump start.  This is not a complaint about the age of the actress (Mulligan), but of how the scenes are written, composed and played.In her interactions with her parents, her teacher Miss Stubbs (Olivia Williams), the headmistress (Emma Thompson) and even David (the older man/Peter Sarsgaard), Jenny is presented as a dominant presence, including being smarter and better spoken than the adults.  A scene with Miss Stubbs has Jenny talking down to her, in both the dialog and the camera angles. At least one scene of Jenny with her parents plays as Jenny being the grown-up and them being her children.In these scenes, Jenny's behavior make it hard to think of her as not being at least in her late 20s--by no stretch of the imagination or dramatic license is it a girl just turned 17.  I attribute this to the distortion of the ""memoir"".  While it is not uncommon for girls of Jenny's age and intelligence to adopt such airs of superiority, I can't believe that they would have been indulged by the adults of that time (I am seven years younger than the author/Jenny).Second, Jenny's transitions just happen, with little or no motivation.  After seeing the movie, I read a couple of reviews of the memoir (in British newspapers) where the word ""unexamined"" kept popping up.  For example, she is presented as an intellectual--interested in big ideas and believing in delayed gratification--who instantly abandons this for the baubles and instant gratification.  For example, her decision to lose her virginity on her 17th birthday appears out of thin air, despite that potentially resulting in her being expelled from school and losing her dream.  Example: Her rejection of the value of an education for women comes in a petulant attack on her teacher Miss Stubbs, in contrast with what we have been shown up to that point.  Although such transitions are staples of coming-of-age movies, the causes are typically a major part of the story.  Here I didn't see even linkages/allusions to those other works to leverage off of.The temptation is to attribute this to teenage rebellion, except that the movie (from the book) states that her parents were pushing her in this direction, except that the movie shows us some contrary evidence.  However, the movie didn't seem intended to provoke questions about the memoir's version, but was simply inheriting its (unexamined?) inconsistencies.Third, her relationship with David seems based entirely on his willingness to spend money on her--we don't _see_ him providing any mentoring or being charming in any other manner.  I didn't see her being led astray, but enthusiastically pursuing the lifestyle that David represented.When she discovers that David is a pathetic little thief and con-man (stealing from widows), she just heedlessly accepts it.  There is no excitement or romantic aspect in his crimes that would appeal to her, so I was left wondering why she wasn't repulsed. The scene played as if David and his friend were a pair of young teenage boys shoplifting, which should have had a Jenny-like girl looking down her nose at them.Fourth, the portrayal of her parents, especially the father (Alfred Molina), seems so riddled with inconsistencies that I had to dismiss it as flagrant distortions from her blaming them for not saving her from herself, despite all she did to deceive them.  Note: The book reviews said that she became estranged from her family as a result of these events.Jenny's ""redemption"" is ambiguous.  Is she rejecting the person she has become: an arrogant, manipulative, untrustworthy, shallow, self-indulgent status-seeker?  Or was Oxford once again her entry point to the world she craved, with David having been a useful steppingstone?  The movie _says_ the former (based on the book), but what I _saw_ made me skeptical.-- RATING explained --For me, Jenny was very unlikable, both because of how she is portrayed and because that portrayal is largely unbelievable (not authentic).  And as Jenny goes, so goes the movie.  The movie lost me at the theft event (at 45 minutes) but I resumed viewing the next day to see if I could see what others saw in this movie and I paused the DVD several more times, hence the 1-star rating.",1,Nothing rings true -- A teenager's year reimagined (by her 60-something self)?,1278547200,"07 8, 2010",2010,6232,"['AUDIENCE', 'review', 'review', 'perspective', 'Many', 'people',

Sorel ""book lovah""","[0, 0]","Last week, I flew to the movie store to rent An Education which was nominated for three Academy Awards including Best Movie and Best Actress. Though the acting with very good, the screenplay with extremely tight, and the movie was an overall success...I was disappointed.The film has been described as a ""coming of age tale"" and it is just that. taking place in 1961, Jenny Mellow attend private school where she excels as a student and a musician. Her ultimate goal, and that of her parents, is to graduate and attend Oxford. Due to this, she spends almost all of her time studying and playing in the band. One day, on her way home from band practice, an older man named David overs her a ride home. Though she is hesitant at first, she finally accepts and the two instantly have a connection that is fostered throughout the rest of the movie. Jenny is terrified that her parents will not approve of their relationship, but to her great surprise they are ecstatic (though completely naive). Slowly, Jenny realizes that David is nothing like what he seems and his true self is far more devious than she could have ever expected. However, she is so enchanted by him that she is willing to throw away everything that she worked for in order to be with him. That is, until she discovers the complete truth about David and must decide to either follow her heart or her better judgment.Overall, the movie is predictable. There is nothing new that hasn't already been done in previous films such as Lolita (though Lolita is far better!) or American Beauty in which an older man seduces a younger woman. Consequently, the young girl discovers the truth about the man who sexually awakens her and the resulting drama threatens the happiness of both parties involved. Thus, this story is not new or is its production anything different from its predecessors. With a screenplay written by Nick Hornby, I expected a bit more from the writing but was disappointed. Overall, it's worth a viewing because it is a good film but do not expect much from it.

1281365,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B002ONC9NC,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[29, 34]","""An Education,"" directed by Lone Scherfig from a screenplay by Nick Hornby, takes place in London in the early sixties.  Jenny Mellor, played by Carey Mulligan, is a bright, middle-class high school girl whose goal is to read English at Oxford University.  Although Jenny's father, Jack (Alfred Molina), loves his only child, he is an excitable and bombastic individual who constantly reminds his family how much everything costs.  Jack's wife, Marjorie, calmly looks on while her husband rants and raves.  Jenny appears to have a bright future ahead of her.  She studies Latin, is well-versed in literature, plays the cello, speaks French, and dreams of leaving Twickenham, the London suburb where her family resides.One rainy day, Jenny is offered a ride by David Goldman (Peter Sarsgaard), a handsome man in his thirties.  He soon asks her out and charms her parents so thoroughly that they permit her to spend time with him.  He buys Jenny new clothes, takes her to night clubs and concerts, and even whisks her off to Paris with his sophisticated cronies.  Jenny is so enamored of David and is having so much fun that she puts her studies and her ambitions for a college education on hold.This film may be viewed as a coming-of-age story, but it is really less than that.  It is a depressing tale of how a worldly man takes advantage of a nave and easily dazzled teenager.  Although all the actors turn in competent performances, the film ultimately falls flat.  It is unthinkable that Jenny's bourgeois parents would let their daughter gallivant around with a man whom they barely know.  Nor is it plausible that a bright girl like Jenny would be so foolish as to believe that she could have a future with a man more than twice her age.Emma Thompson has a thankless role as Jenny's prissy and prejudiced headmistress, and Rosamund Pike is Helen, David's brainless and glamorous friend, who teaches Jenny how to dress fashionably and apply makeup.  Olivia Williams plays Miss Stubbs, Jenny's stern English teacher, and she is one of the film's few bright spots.  Miss Stubbs genuinely wants what is best for her prize pupil and is aghast to learn that this promising young lady may be about to throw away her future.  Although Sarsgaard gives David an occasional bit of shading, his character is basically a sleaze.  It is cringe-inducing to watch him beguile the inexperienced Jenny, who learns the hard way that there are no short-cuts to becoming an adult.",3,Growing up is hard to do.,1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,2464,"['Education', 'directed', 'Lone', 'Scherfig', 'screenplay', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'place', 'London', 'early', 'sixties', 'Jenny', 'Mellor', 'played', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'bright', 'middle-class', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'goal', 'read', 'English', 'Oxford', 'University', 'Jenny', 'father', 'Jack', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'only', 'child', 'excitable', 'bombastic', 'individual', 'who', 'constantly', 'family', 'how', 'much', 'everything', 'costs', 'Jack', 'wife', 'Marjorie', 'calmly', 'husband', 'rants', 'raves', 'Jenny', 'have', 'bright', 'future', 'ahead', 'studies', 'Latin', 'well-versed', 'literature', 'cello', 'French', 'dreams', 'leaving', 'Twickenham', 'London', 'suburb', 'where', 'family', 'resides.One', 'rainy', 'day', 'Jenny', 'offered', 'ride', 'David', 'Goldman', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'handsome', 'man', 'thirties', 'soon', 'out', 'charms', 'parents', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'permit', 'spend', 'time', 'Jenny', 'new', 'clothes', 'night', 'clubs', 'concerts', 'even', 'whisks', 'off', 'Paris', 'sophisticated', 'cronies', 'Jenny', 'so', 'enamored', 'David', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'studies', 'ambitions', 'college', 'education', 'hold.This', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'viewed', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'really', 'less', 'depressing', 'tale', 'how', 'worldly', 'man', 'advantage', 'nave', 'easily', 'dazzled', 'teenager', 'actors', 'turn', 'competent', 'performances', 'film', 'ultimately', 'flat', 'unthinkable', 'Jenny', 'bourgeois', 'parents', 'would', 'let', 'daughter', 'gallivant', 'man', 'whom', 'barely', 'know', 'plausible', 'bright', 'girl', 'Jenny', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'foolish', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'future', 'man', 'more', 'twice', 'age.Emma', 'Thompson', 'thankless', 'role', 'Jenny', 'prissy', 'prejudiced', 'headmistress', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Helen', 'David', 'brainless', 'glamorous', 'friend', 'who', 'Jenny', 'how', 'dress', 'fashionably', 'apply', 'makeup', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Miss', 'Stubbs', 'Jenny', 'stern', 'English', 'teacher', 'one', 'film', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', 'Miss', 'Stubbs', 'genuinely', 'what', 'best', 'prize', 'pupil', 'aghast', 'learn', 'promising', 'young', 'lady', 'may', 'be', 'throw', 'away', 'future', 'Sarsgaard', 'David', 'occasional', 'bit', 'shading', 'character', 'basically', 'sleaze', 'cringe-inducing', 'watch', 'beguile', 'inexperienced', 'Jenny', 'who', 'hard', 'way', 'are', 'short-cuts', 'becoming', 'adult']",N/A
1281366,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002ONC9NC,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","In the pre-Beatles dawn of 1961, Jenny Mellor is an utterly precocious 16-year-old schoolgirl who peppers her conversations with existential references and French malapropos as she aspires to be a worldly sophisticate living the high life in Paris. The reality is that she lives with her middle-class parents in the London suburb of Twickenham as she studies Latin and prepares for admission to Oxford, her parents' lifelong dream. The chasm between reality and fantasy suddenly seems to disappear with the unexpected arrival of David Goldman, a thirty-something charmer who sweeps her off her feet. The relationship starts out innocently enough and then becomes a head-spinning swirl of concerts, jazz clubs, art auctions and eventually a fateful trip to Paris.Directed by Danish filmmaker Lone Scherfig, the film is reminiscent of 1960's-era youth-oriented films like Tony Richardson'sA Taste of Honeyand James Clavell'sTo Sir, With Lovein serving as a cautionary, coming-of-age tale, but the screenplay by Nick Hornby (adapted from Lynn Barber's memoir) never panders to the more tawdry dimensions of the older man/younger girl affair. In fact, what I appreciate most about this affectionate, low-key film is that Scherfig and Hornby maintain a nonjudgmental attitude toward the characters, including David, his smarmy ""business partner"" Danny, and Danny's vacuously fashionable girlfriend Helen. Instead, we are guided on one young woman's entry into the adult world of love from blind infatuation to crashing heartbreak.Even as she faces unexpected truths about David, Jenny recognizes that her desires are real, even if they are shallow or misguided. She can't help but act upon them, even dropping out of her A-levels for Oxford, and in turn, when things become complicated, Jenny knows she is accountable for her own actions as she is forced to reconcile them with her evolving self-revelations. As Jenny, Carey Mulligan turns in a beguiling performance that has critics reaching for apt comparisons with the likes of Audrey Hepburn, Jean Seberg, and Audrey Tautou. The gamine quality is certainly there, but Mulligan's fierce intelligence and watchful demeanor are what really ground the film. Moreover, what makes Peter Sarsgaard's performance as the elliptical David particularly effective is that he makes what should have been a morally reprehensible character into someone with a genuine, almost naive regard for Jenny.Because the actors make the relationship real rather than a fantasy version, the love scenes between Mulligan (actually 22 when this was filmed) and Sarsgaard are sweet with none of the predatory tension that would have inescapably darkened the film's tone. The chameleonic Alfred Molina is terrifically engaging as Jenny's class-conscious father, while Dominic Cooper (Mamma Mia! The Movie) and especially Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day) sharply play Danny and Helen as hedonistic social dandies constantly on the prowl for a good time. Cinematographer John de Borman makes Paris a beautiful, inviting playground for the lovers and suburban London a fitting social contrast. The 2010 DVD contains some bare-bones extras - a few deleted scenes, a promotional featurette titled ""Walking the Red Carpet"", and an insightful commentary track with Scherfig, Mulligan, and Sarsgaard.",4,"A Cautionary, Coming-of-Age Tale Sparked by Mulligan's Insightful Performance",1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,3310,"['pre-Beatles', 'dawn', '1961', 'Jenny', 'Mellor', 'utterly', 'precocious', '16-year-old', 'schoolgirl', 'who', 'conversations', 'existential', 'references', 'French', 'malapropos', 'be', 'worldly', 'sophisticate', 'living', 'high', 'life', 'Paris', 'reality', 'middle-class', 'parents', 'London', 'suburb', 'Twickenham', 'studies', 'Latin', 'prepares', 'admission', 'Oxford', 'parents', 'lifelong', 'dream', 'chasm', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'suddenly', 'disappear', 'unexpected', 'arrival', 'David', 'Goldman', 'thirty-something', 'charmer', 'who', 'off', 'feet', 'relationship', 'out', 'innocently', 'enough', 'then', 'head-spinning', 'swirl', 'concerts', 'jazz', 'clubs', 'art', 'auctions', 'eventually', 'fateful', 'trip', 'Paris.Directed', 'Danish', 'filmmaker', 'Lone', 'Scherfig', 'film', 'reminiscent', ""1960's-era"", 'youth-oriented', 'films', 'Tony', ""Richardson'sA"", 'Taste', 'Honeyand', 'James', ""Clavell'sTo"", 'Sir', 'Lovein', 'serving', 'cautionary', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'screenplay', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'adapted', 'Lynn', 'Barber', 'memoir', 'never', 'panders', 'more', 'tawdry', 'dimensions', 'older', 'man/younger', 'girl', 'affair', 'fact', 'what', 'appreciate', 'most', 'affectionate', 'low-key', 'film', 'Scherfig', 'Hornby', 'maintain', 'nonjudgmental', 'attitude', 'characters', 'including', 'David', 'smarmy', 'business', 'partner', 'Danny', 'Danny', 'vacuously', 'fashionable', 'girlfriend', 'Helen', 'Instead', 'are', 'guided', 'one', 'young', 'woman', 'entry', 'adult', 'world', 'love', 'blind', 'infatuation', 'crashing', 'heartbreak.Even', 'unexpected', 'truths', 'David', 'Jenny', 'desires', 'are', 'real', 'even', 'are', 'shallow', 'misguided', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'act', 'even', 'dropping', 'A-levels', 'Oxford', 'turn', 'when', 'things', 'become', 'complicated', 'Jenny', 'accountable', 'own', 'actions', 'forced', 'reconcile', 'evolving', 'self-revelations', 'Jenny', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'beguiling', 'performance', 'critics', 'reaching', 'apt', 'comparisons', 'likes', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Jean', 'Seberg', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'gamine', 'quality', 'certainly', 'there', 'Mulligan', 'fierce', 'intelligence', 'watchful', 'demeanor', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'ground', 'film', 'Moreover', 'what', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'performance', 'elliptical', 'David', 'particularly', 'effective', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'morally', 'reprehensible', 'character', 'someone', 'genuine', 'almost', 'naive', 'regard', 'Jenny.Because', 'actors', 'make', 'relationship', 'real', 'rather', 'fantasy', 'version', 'love', 'scenes', 'Mulligan', 'actually', '22', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', 'Sarsgaard', 'are', 'sweet', 'none', 'predatory', 'tension', 'would', 'have', 'inescapably', 'darkened', 'film', 'tone', 'chameleonic', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'terrifically', 'engaging', 'Jenny', 'class-conscious', 'father', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'Movie', 'especially', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Die', 'Day', 'sharply', 'play', 'Danny', 'Helen', 'hedonistic', 'social', 'dandies', 'constantly', 'prowl', 'good', 'time', 'Cinematographer', 'John', 'Borman', 'Paris', 'beautiful', 'inviting', 'playground', 'lovers', 'suburban', 'London', 'fitting', 'social', 'contrast', '2010', 'DVD', 'bare-bones', 'extras', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'promotional', 'featurette', 'titled', 'Walking', 'Red', 'Carpet', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'track', 'Scherfig', 'Mulligan', 'Sarsgaard']",N/A

Other reviewers place this delightful comedy/drama in the coming-of-age realm, but I place this diamond a part of the trilogy of teacher/student films,a completion of ""To Sir,With Love"" and ""The Prime Of Miss Brodie."" In a little more time than an hour, you will have a glimpse of a teacher's private abode establishing correctness of high standards of conduct. The casting is flawless when only describing Carey Mulligan's face that luminates between juvenile to pixie-ish delightful in a few seconds. As you view this school girl slip into the dangerous waters away from her protected boarding school and deceivingly beyond her parental moorings, a familiar tension heightens to a frightening level only a parent or sibling would comprehend. While witty and smart, the drama becomes sinister and threatening. Will this child/woman rebel or listen to wisdom? The mannner and way she resolves her dilemma is magnificent. The viewer is equally seduced by the charm and allure of the swinging-sixties crowd and music as much as the supporting cast that wraps this tale in brushstrokes from many British swinging movies like ""Darling"" and ""Georgy Girl,"" which means you are in for a very special treat indeed. It is so spot-on in 60s atmosphere that I expected Michael Caine to pop in any moment. ""An Education,"" preaches loudly in one scene late in the movie when Mulligan's character must confront a perceived spinsterish school martinet in her own home that luxuriates with more sophistication than this adolescent girl could summon in her 17 years in a slow pan of the camera. That confrontation alone, where both characters make peace in minimum words was the pivotal tipping point in the film that propels this British film into a classic. It becomes the quietest slap-down that you will ever see and feel.I would make this film (and the others mentioned above) mandatory viewing along with Liam Neeson's thriller ""Taken,"" for any adolescent teen. An education is what you do with your learning.

Based on a memoir by Lynn Barber and adapted very smartly for the screen by the talented Nick Hornby, AN EDUCATION, like every aspect of the film, is an understated bit of life.  It is basically a 1960s London coming of age story of a 16 year old bright young student Jenny (Carey Mulligan, a true find) who life is focused on passing exams to gain entrance into Oxford to read English. Her father Jack (Alfred Molina in one of his very finest roles to date) is her demanding father who refuses to let Jenny stray form his dream of her achieving an Oxford education: Jenny's passive mother Marjorie (Cara Seymour) seems browbeaten into believing Jack's goals. But enter the handsome if enigmatic David (Peter Sarsgaard) who sweeps Jenny off her feet despite the age difference and Jenny's plans for Oxford seem to be changing to a life of music and art and travel and fun: David's accomplice friends (Danny - Dominic Cooper and Helen - Rosamund Pike) help seduce the bright Jenny away from academia - until Jenny learns of the methods in which David and Danny make their living as petty thieves.  Always in the background are Jenny's teachers Olivia Williams and Emma Thompson who prove to be better 'educated' than the rest of the crew!  The story may not be new or unique but the delivery by this enormously talented cast makes it a film not likely to be forgotten.

1281370,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002ONC9NC,Haunted Flower,"[4, 5]","This movie was one of the best stories I've seen in a movie in a while. ""An Education"" was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars this year and was directed by Lone Scherfig based on a memoir by Lynn Barber and adapted for the screen by writer, Nick Hornby who wrote ""High Fidelity"" and ""About a Boy"". Hornby's story-telling skills are tip-top and it showed here in this coming-of-age story of a young woman in the 1960s trying to get into Oxford University when her life changes with the distraction of an older man and his free-spirited life of concerts, art, and trips to Paris.Carey Mulligan was nominated for Best Actress for her role as Jenny and she deserves it. She has all the charm and energy of a young Audrey Hepburn and even styles her hair like her. (Coincidentally, I just noticed on IMDB that Mulligan is slated to be Eliza Doolittle in a remake of ""My Fair Lady"" for 2012!) Mulligan is so easy to empathize with as Jenny and really wears her heart on her sleeve. It reminds me in some ways of another story, ""Sabrina"" which the older version ALSO had Audrey Hepburn. She seems to embody that youthful spirit with a depth of maturity that is just a pleasure to watch.Besides looks, Jenny is fiercely clever and curious about all manner of things French and is eager to learn anything she can about the lifestyle. Jenny's upbringing by her parents played by Alfred Molina and Cara Seymour stresses the importance of study and a good education, hence her goal of Oxford.But women are not taken seriously in this time and even if you study, you might end up as a teacher or in some public service role. Schooling is just another venue to finding an ideal mate to support you the rest of your life. The very idea is frustrating to Jenny when she is so intensely intelligent, but even her women's liberation attitude can be swept away by Peter Sarsgaard's charm.David played by Peter Sarsgaard is something of a playboy who plays very hard all the time and sweeps Jenny into his world of exciting auctions, racetracks, and clubs. David has a way with words and delivery that seems to make everyone including Jenny's parents eat out of the palm of his hand.David's clever words do not last forever as Jenny starts to uncover some secrets about him he was not forthcoming with. Sarsgaard's English accent is deceptively good for someone born in Illinois. It has a very light touch so that it is harder to catch any flubs but seems quiet natural. At first the age difference seems a bit creepy but what wins the audience over into belief is not Sarsgaard's performance by Mulligan's commitment to the mutual attraction.David hangs out with another couple - Danny and Helen played by Dominic Cooper and Rosamund Pike. Rosamund Pike is delightful as the opposite of everything Jenny is but the foreshadowing of everything she could become if she changed her path. Helen is a ditzy-type mainly in the group for her attractiveness but prone to making flighty statements like, ""No one will be speaking Latin in five years, not even Latin people."" She makes it completely believable that someone could be content with their low level of knowledge and just play and be arm candy. Her example is the only way for Jenny's character to really make comparisons and decisions about whom she wants to be.I also have to mention the lovely Emma Thompson whom I adore made an appearance as a strict head mistress of Jenny's school who gives a realistic portrayal of the arguments put into motion about the education process. Also Olivia Williams as Miss Stubbs gives another fantastic performance as a teacher who is disillusioned with the education process short of the few brilliant students like Jenny who make it worthwhile again.I can't express properly would an enjoyable story this was and what a great journey. Women did not have as many options in those days as we do now and seeing the comparisons is awakening. This is the best and most subtle romance story that I saw from 2009 as well in a time when everything is a rom-com or a Nicholas Sparks overboard of tears, this one blends the romance with the story of a young woman's search for identity and deciding her future. I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it.",5,"Carey Mulligan shines in ""An Education""",1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,4232,"['movie', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'while', 'Education', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscars', 'year', 'was', 'directed', 'Lone', 'Scherfig', 'based', 'memoir', 'Lynn', 'Barber', 'adapted', 'screen', 'writer', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'who', 'wrote', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'Boy', 'Hornby', 'story-telling', 'skills', 'are', 'tip-top', 'showed', 'here', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'young', 'woman', '1960s', 'trying', 'get', 'Oxford', 'University', 'when', 'life', 'changes', 'distraction', 'older', 'man', 'free-spirited', 'life', 'concerts', 'art', 'trips', 'Paris.Carey', 'Mulligan', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'role', 'Jenny', 'charm', 'energy', 'young', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'even', 'hair', 'Coincidentally', 'just', 'noticed', 'IMDB', 'Mulligan', 'slated', 'be', 'Eliza', 'Doolittle', 'remake', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', '2012', 'Mulligan', 'so', 'easy', 'empathize', 'Jenny', 'really', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'ways', 'story', 'Sabrina', 'older', 'version', 'ALSO', 'had', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'embody', 'youthful', 'spirit', 'depth', 'maturity', 'just', 'pleasure', 'watch.Besides', 'looks', 'Jenny', 'fiercely', 'clever', 'curious', 'manner', 'things', 'French', 'eager', 'learn', 'anything', 'can', 'lifestyle', 'Jenny', 'upbringing', 'parents', 'played', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Cara', 'Seymour', 'importance', 'study', 'good', 'education', 'hence', 'goal', 'Oxford.But', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'taken', 'seriously', 'time', 'even', 'study', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'teacher', 'public', 'service', 'role', 'Schooling', 'just', 'venue', 'finding', 'ideal', 'mate', 'support', 'rest', 'life', 'very', 'idea', 'frustrating', 'Jenny', 'when', 'so', 'intensely', 'intelligent', 'even', 'women', 'liberation', 'attitude', 'can', 'be', 'swept', 'away', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'charm.David', 'played', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'something', 'playboy', 'who', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'sweeps', 'Jenny', 'world', 'exciting', 'auctions', 'racetracks', 'clubs', 'David', 'way', 'words', 'delivery', 'make', 'everyone', 'including', 'Jenny', 'parents', 'eat', 'palm', 'hand.David', 'clever', 'words', 'do', 'not', 'last', 'forever', 'Jenny', 'uncover', 'secrets', 'was', 'not', 'forthcoming', 'Sarsgaard', 'English', 'accent', 'deceptively', 'good', 'someone', 'born', 'Illinois', 'very', 'light', 'touch', 'harder', 'catch', 'flubs', 'quiet', 'natural', 'first', 'age', 'difference', 'bit', 'creepy', 'what', 'audience', 'belief', 'not', 'Sarsgaard', 'performance', 'Mulligan', 'commitment', 'mutual', 'attraction.David', 'hangs', 'out', 'couple', 'Danny', 'Helen', 'played', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'delightful', 'opposite', 'everything', 'Jenny', 'foreshadowing', 'everything', 'could', 'become', 'changed', 'path', 'Helen', 'ditzy-type', 'mainly', 'group', 'attractiveness', 'prone', 'making', 'flighty', 'statements', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'speaking', 'Latin', 'five', 'years', 'not', 'even', 'Latin', 'people', 'completely', 'believable', 'someone', 'could', 'be', 'content', 'low', 'level', 'knowledge', 'just', 'play', 'be', 'arm', 'candy', 'example', 'only', 'way', 'Jenny', 'character', 'really', 'make', 'comparisons', 'decisions', 'whom', 'be.I', 'also', 'have', 'mention', 'lovely', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'whom', 'adore', 'made', 'appearance', 'strict', 'head', 'mistress', 'Jenny', 'school', 'who', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'arguments', 'put', 'motion', 'education', 'process', 'Also', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Miss', 'Stubbs', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'teacher', 'who', 'disillusioned', 'education', 'process', 'short', 'few', 'brilliant', 'students', 'Jenny', 'who', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'again.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'properly', 'would', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'was', 'what', 'great', 'journey', 'Women', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'many', 'options', 'days', 'do', 'now', 'seeing', 'comparisons', 'awakening', 'best', 'most', 'subtle', 'romance', 'story', 'saw', '2009', 'well', 'time', 'when', 'everything', 'rom-com', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'overboard', 'tears', 'one', 'romance', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'search', 'identity', 'deciding', 'future', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen']",N/A

Art direction and recreation of the 60's are impecable and there are many enjoyable witty dialogue lines. The movie is never boring and keeps you expectant all the time for that turn in the story that will surprise you and make it memorable... but it never comes.It is true that such a ""twist"" is not essential. Being able to captivate an audience by re-telling a very well known old story also has an enormous merit. But ""An Education"" does not achieve this either. The misfortunes of an innocent young girl deceived by a charming older man have been brought to the screen many times, and so have coming of age stories, both categories into which ""An Education"" could be classified. However, this version is certainly not one that will be remembered among the best.It could be forgiven that the ""innocent girl"" appears too far from gullible. It could be argued that she is rather more dazzled than deceived. However, there is an extremely naive treatment of some characters that are essential to the story, especially the initially strict father who falls too easily a prey to the charm and lies of the mature man that chases his teenage daughter. Even if it could be accepted that, in reality, he is letting her go willingly, expecting that in this way (just as she does) she will get more from life and more easily than by pursuing her studies at Oxford, the movie never portrays his inner struggle or thought process. The same comments apply to other characters, like Emma Thompson's headmistress, who is described in an extremely simplistic way as a decidedly moralistic anti-semitic bitch, uncapable of giving a lovable brilliant girl who made a mistake a second chance. So the story becomes not only predictable but very linear, with many of the characters becoming just decorative accesories (very pleasant to look at, that it is true) to help move forward the narrative of the story, but devoid of any depth.The moralistic end with the main character's redemption, though not necessarily a negative had the whole story been more solid, adds another element of predictability that does not help to enhance one's final impression of the film.In short, this is a movie where all the formal aspects have been very well taken care of. If it had had a script with a bit more creativity or better defined characters, it could have been believable and, who knows, even memorable. Unfortunately, it is just as a gift box wrapped in bright paper and colourful ribbons, which you untie and open only to find a pair of socks which you have already worn before and not even your best.",2,Good actors lacking a solid script,1265328000,"02 5, 2010",2010,2615,"['education', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'Art', 'direction', 'recreation', '60', 'are', 'impecable', 'are', 'many', 'enjoyable', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'lines', 'movie', 'never', 'boring', 'expectant', 'time', 'turn', 'story', 'will', 'surprise', 'make', 'memorable', 'never', 'true', 'twist', 'not', 'essential', 'Being', 'able', 'captivate', 'audience', 're-telling', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'old', 'story', 'also', 'enormous', 'merit', 'Education', 'not', 'achieve', 'misfortunes', 'innocent', 'young', 'girl', 'deceived', 'charming', 'older', 'man', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'screen', 'many', 'times', 'so', 'have', 'coming', 'age', 'stories', 'categories', 'Education', 'could', 'be', 'classified', 'However', 'version', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'best.It', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'innocent', 'girl', 'too', 'far', 'gullible', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'rather', 'more', 'dazzled', 'deceived', 'However', 'extremely', 'naive', 'treatment', 'characters', 'are', 'essential', 'story', 'especially', 'initially', 'strict', 'father', 'who', 'too', 'easily', 'prey', 'charm', 'lies', 'mature', 'man', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Even', 'could', 'be', 'accepted', 'reality', 'letting', 'go', 'willingly', 'expecting', 'way', 'just', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'life', 'more', 'easily', 'pursuing', 'studies', 'Oxford', 'movie', 'never', 'inner', 'struggle', 'thought', 'process', 'same', 'comments', 'apply', 'other', 'characters', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'headmistress', 'who', 'described', 'extremely', 'simplistic', 'way', 'decidedly', 'moralistic', 'anti-semitic', 'bitch', 'uncapable', 'giving', 'lovable', 'brilliant', 'girl', 'who', 'made', 'mistake', 'second', 'chance', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'predictable', 'very', 'linear', 'many', 'characters', 'becoming', 'just', 'decorative', 'accesories', 'very', 'pleasant', 'look', 'true', 'help', 'move', 'forward', 'narrative', 'story', 'devoid', 'depth.The', 'moralistic', 'end', 'main', 'character', 'redemption', 'not', 'necessarily', 'negative', 'had', 'whole', 'story', 'been', 'more', 'solid', 'element', 'predictability', 'not', 'help', 'enhance', 'one', 'final', 'impression', 'film.In', 'short', 'movie', 'where', 'formal', 'aspects', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'well', 'taken', 'care', 'had', 'had', 'script', 'bit', 'more', 'creativity', 'better', 'defined', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'believable', 'who', 'even', 'memorable', 'Unfortunately', 'just', 'gift', 'box', 'wrapped', 'bright', 'paper', 'colourful', 'ribbons', 'untie', 'open', 'only', 'find', 'pair', 'socks', 'have', 'already', 'worn', 'before', 'not', 'even', 'best']",N/A

This is truly one impressive film that deserves recognition and is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. I am not a Nick Hornby fan by any means, but I was truly in awe of this story he created. I hope he continues to write more scripts like this! Carey Mulligan, who plays Jenny, is a captivating actress and is going to make quite the name for herself someday. She is not just a pretty face- she has a talent too!  Originally, what allured me to watch this film was because Peter Sarsgaard, who plays David, was in it. Sarsgaard is one of the better actors in Hollywood and never gets the recognition he deserves. However, that might be a good thing considering how he always seems to amaze me in his roles (except for The Orphan- honestly, I don't know why he did that film).

1281378,A1U8WT6QFTLQ47,B002ONC9NC,"JennyJuniper ""regal188""","[21, 22]","**Spoiler alert**...though the plot really isn't a secret.The basic plot of An Education is slight, but superb acting and directing lift the story of a schoolgirl's affair into a study of regret, fear and yearning--it's often very funny, sure, but still a little heartbreaking despite the essentially `happy ending.'Carey Mulligan was rightly praised for her portrayal of Jenny, but I have to say that Peter Sarsgaard is incredible. He's no creepy conman who just wants to seduce a young girl. He wants to actually be her, to take all that freshness and curiosity into himself, to have all that possibility laid out before him. At heart he's all too aware of how badly his life has gone wrong. His business (working for notorious slumlord Peter Rachman) is tawdry, and his marriage and home are shabby. He's deceiving himself as well as Jenny when he spins his dreams and explanations; and he loves to see himself through her eyes--as a worldly, exciting man. Of course he's happy to wait for her to be ready to lose her virginity, of course he's peculiar in bed: sex was never the point. And tie-clipped David can't in reality compete with his more sophisticated and wealthier friend Danny, so he's terrified into rash action when he sees him flirting with Jenny.Jenny and her mother both know that there's something a little bit wrong with David. Jenny has doubts about David from the moment he makes an asinine, flattering remark to her mother, but puts them aside. If I have one complaint about the movie it's this: to me it's implausible that Jenny would have ditched her A levels, even though I know it's a memoir and she DID ditch her A levels. As played by Mulligan, Jenny is smarter and more perceptive than that. She's someone who'd see no reason to make a choice between university and marriage.The supporting cast is fabulous. Jenny's bombastic lower middle-class father yearns for his daughter to be clever and confident, able to mix with the `right' people. Caught wrong-footed by the more urbane David, whom he sees as his social superior, he's easily played. ""All my life I've been scared,"" he admits to Jenny in the end, ""I didn't want you to be scared.""Jenny's mother is wistful for the days when she knew how to get to St John's, Smith Square; her face and body language are pitch-perfect as she waits up for her daughter after that first date. She's a mother who remembers how it was--and wishes it could still be so. She's both terrified for her daughter and wishes that she was her.  She knows David isn't quite right, but she's still charmed by him. And she appears to be a heck of a lot brighter than her husband, but like all the women in this film, has had limited opportunities.Jenny's nave but she's no victim. I see that some viewers don't find the story credible. From a modern perspective, especially an American perspective, perhaps it's not. But having grown up in pretty similar circumstances not too many years after Jenny, I found it to almost eerily reflect the times, the persuasions of class, and the desires of a young girl living in them.  And having had a very similar conversation with a very similar headmistress, I can assure you that Emma Thompson's character is spot-on.",5,Subtly brilliant,1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,3217,"['**Spoiler', 'alert**', 'plot', 'really', ""n't"", 'secret.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'Education', 'slight', 'superb', 'acting', 'directing', 'lift', 'story', 'schoolgirl', 'affair', 'study', 'regret', 'fear', 'yearning', 'often', 'very', 'funny', 'sure', 'still', 'little', 'heartbreaking', 'essentially', 'happy', 'ending', ""'Carey"", 'Mulligan', 'was', 'rightly', 'praised', 'portrayal', 'Jenny', 'have', 'say', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'incredible', 'creepy', 'conman', 'who', 'just', 'seduce', 'young', 'girl', 'actually', 'be', 'take', 'freshness', 'curiosity', 'have', 'possibility', 'laid', 'out', 'heart', 'too', 'aware', 'how', 'badly', 'life', 'gone', 'wrong', 'business', 'working', 'notorious', 'slumlord', 'Peter', 'Rachman', 'tawdry', 'marriage', 'home', 'are', 'shabby', 'deceiving', 'as', 'well', 'Jenny', 'when', 'dreams', 'explanations', 'see', 'eyes', 'worldly', 'exciting', 'man', 'course', 'happy', 'wait', 'be', 'ready', 'lose', 'virginity', 'course', 'peculiar', 'bed', 'sex', 'was', 'never', 'point', 'tie-clipped', 'David', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reality', 'compete', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'wealthier', 'friend', 'Danny', 'terrified', 'rash', 'action', 'when', 'flirting', 'Jenny.Jenny', 'mother', 'know', 'something', 'little', 'bit', 'wrong', 'David', 'Jenny', 'doubts', 'David', 'moment', 'asinine', 'flattering', 'remark', 'mother', 'aside', 'have', 'one', 'complaint', 'movie', 'implausible', 'Jenny', 'would', 'have', 'ditched', 'A', 'levels', 'even', 'know', 'memoir', 'DID', 'ditch', 'A', 'levels', 'played', 'Mulligan', 'Jenny', 'smarter', 'more', 'perceptive', 'someone', 'who', ""'d"", 'see', 'reason', 'make', 'choice', 'university', 'marriage.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fabulous', 'Jenny', 'bombastic', 'lower', 'middle-class', 'father', 'yearns', 'daughter', 'be', 'clever', 'confident', 'able', 'mix', 'right', 'people', 'Caught', 'wrong-footed', 'more', 'urbane', 'David', 'whom', 'social', 'superior', 'easily', 'played', 'life', ""'ve"", 'been', 'scared', 'Jenny', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'scared', 'Jenny', 'mother', 'wistful', 'days', 'when', 'knew', 'how', 'get', 'St', 'John', 'Smith', 'Square', 'face', 'body', 'language', 'are', 'pitch-perfect', 'up', 'daughter', 'first', 'date', 'mother', 'who', 'how', 'was', 'wishes', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'so', 'terrified', 'daughter', 'wishes', 'was', 'David', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'still', 'charmed', 'be', 'heck', 'lot', 'brighter', 'husband', 'women', 'film', 'had', 'limited', 'opportunities.Jenny', 'nave', 'victim', 'see', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'story', 'credible', 'modern', 'perspective', 'especially', 'American', 'perspective', 'perhaps', 'not', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'pretty', 'similar', 'circumstances', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'Jenny', 'found', 'almost', 'eerily', 'reflect', 'times', 'persuasions', 'class', 'desires', 'young', 'girl', 'living', 'having', 'had', 'very', 'similar', 'conversation', 'very', 'similar', 'headmistress', 'can', 'assure', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'character', 'spot-on']",N/A

A man (actor Peter Sarggaard) at least twice her age charms her into a ride home in his spiffy sports car. Gradually she falls for him; he buys her gifts, talks her middle class parents (the father played skillfully by Alfred Molina)into a concert with supper afterwards, a night away in Oxford, and a weekend in Paris. She gradually learns that not only is he a charmer, but he's a dodgy scam artist barely skirting the law.The father wants her to go to Oxford, but he knows how expensive it is. When the charmer proposes marriage, the father thinks that this rich guy may be able to provide his daughter with a decent future, and he won't have to foot her university bills.This all calls for your suspension of disbelief. The film has too many implausibilities and improbabilities for a discerning viewer to countenance. Sure the older guy likes girls, is obsessed by them, gets his kicks from them. That's believable enough, but his scams seem invented by a lazy screenwriter, and the girl and particularly her bourgeois family's acquiescence don't seem to compute. The father is a tough old bird who seems to give in too easily.The teacher at the school is very good as is Emma Thompson in a small role as headmistress.

1281381,ARK323I3EV98D,B002ONC9NC,Jordan D. Wilson,"[0, 0]","The title of Lone Scherfig's An Education refers not to the academic education that sixteen year old Jenny (Carey Mulligan) is expected to achieve, not to mention her scholarship to oxford, but rather the life education that she receives and experiences through her romantic infatuation with 35 year old David (Peter Sarsgaard), as well as the lessons that she learns about herself and her own naivety.The year is 1961, and Jenny is a girl who is full of life and is interested in music, French culture, and essentially living life to the fullest. She wants to go to Paris, and to experience romance and possibility. Her parents, Jack and Marjorie, played by Alfred Molina and Cara Seymour, are loving, doting people who only want the best for their daughter. They worry mostly about her financial and domestic security, which David seems very willing to offer her.Jenny is almost immediately wooed by David's silver tongue and charm, although I'm not sure if she is necessarily moved by him as much as the idea of him allowing her and encouraging her to spread her wings and fly. She has the opportunity to abandon her schooling, and her future at Oxford for a life of romance, Parisian living, freedom from the rules and regulations of her life at home, and for whatever else a life with David comes with. But is the cost of losing an education really something worth gambling over? Is the life that Jenny so dearly dreams of and desires all it seems to be?Is David really what he seems to be? Is he honest and true, loyal and compassionate and perfect? Of course he is not, and that is the point. He is 35, she is 16. He is very interested in sex with her, and eventually she is deeply interested in sex with him, but this is not the foundation of their infatuation. There is something more, but the level at which it would become a full-time, working relationship is just out of reach. Sarsgaard plays David so cunning and so debonair that I lost sight of the character's sleaziness at times, and the disturbing, somewhat sinister nature of the relationship itself.The screenplay, by Nick Hornby, whose novel About a Boy was made into a brilliant film by the Weitz brothers in 2002, is very tender and smart, but I felt the final sequences were a bit contrived. I won't go to into detail, but let's just say that sometimes a clean resolution is not what a story like this calls for. I wanted a bit more, and then it was over, and some of the less explained parts of David's life were sort of wished away. Although this did prove a bit distracting, some of the moments leading up to the finale were brilliantly acted by Alfred Molina and Emma Thompson, who both are delightful to watch in this film. Molina has a golden way with words, in which he turns every line into a father's plea for his daughter to understand his point of view, and where he is truly coming from. Thompson also proves to be very convincing as the Headmistress of Jenny's school, who doesn't seem to care very deeply about Jenny's future.I think that this film is almost completely carried on Carey Mulligan's back, and she has a great talent as a young actress: she manages to play a likable, even lovable, teenaged girl who is anything but perfect and lives through her own flaws. I think that all of the recent comparisons to Audrey Hepburn are spot on, and that her oscar nomination is looming around the corner. She is so believable and convincing in this part, and she is quite literally the heart and soul of nearly every single scene she is in, even, and sometimes especially, when she is not saying a word, but simply changing her expression a certain way, or staring in wonder at the world that surrounds her.",5,A Star is Born,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,3695,"['title', 'Lone', 'Scherfig', 'Education', 'refers', 'not', 'academic', 'education', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'Jenny', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'expected', 'achieve', 'not', 'mention', 'scholarship', 'oxford', 'rather', 'life', 'education', 'experiences', 'romantic', 'infatuation', '35', 'year', 'old', 'David', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'as', 'well', 'lessons', 'herself', 'own', 'naivety.The', 'year', '1961', 'Jenny', 'girl', 'who', 'full', 'life', 'interested', 'music', 'French', 'culture', 'essentially', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'go', 'Paris', 'experience', 'romance', 'possibility', 'parents', 'Jack', 'Marjorie', 'played', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Cara', 'Seymour', 'are', 'loving', 'doting', 'people', 'who', 'only', 'want', 'best', 'daughter', 'worry', 'mostly', 'financial', 'domestic', 'security', 'David', 'very', 'willing', 'offer', 'her.Jenny', 'almost', 'immediately', 'wooed', 'David', 'silver', 'tongue', 'charm', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'necessarily', 'moved', 'as', 'much', 'idea', 'allowing', 'encouraging', 'spread', 'wings', 'fly', 'opportunity', 'abandon', 'schooling', 'future', 'Oxford', 'life', 'romance', 'Parisian', 'living', 'freedom', 'rules', 'regulations', 'life', 'home', 'else', 'life', 'David', 'cost', 'losing', 'education', 'really', 'something', 'worth', 'gambling', 'life', 'Jenny', 'so', 'dearly', 'dreams', 'be', 'David', 'really', 'what', 'be', 'honest', 'true', 'loyal', 'compassionate', 'perfect', 'course', 'not', 'point', '35', '16', 'very', 'interested', 'sex', 'eventually', 'deeply', 'interested', 'sex', 'not', 'foundation', 'infatuation', 'something', 'more', 'level', 'would', 'become', 'full-time', 'working', 'relationship', 'just', 'reach', 'Sarsgaard', 'David', 'so', 'cunning', 'so', 'debonair', 'lost', 'sight', 'character', 'sleaziness', 'times', 'disturbing', 'somewhat', 'sinister', 'nature', 'relationship', 'itself.The', 'screenplay', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'novel', 'Boy', 'was', 'made', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Weitz', 'brothers', '2002', 'very', 'tender', 'smart', 'felt', 'final', 'sequences', 'were', 'bit', 'contrived', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'sometimes', 'clean', 'resolution', 'not', 'what', 'story', 'wanted', 'bit', 'more', 'then', 'was', 'over', 'less', 'explained', 'parts', 'David', 'life', 'were', 'sort', 'wished', 'away', 'did', 'prove', 'bit', 'distracting', 'moments', 'leading', 'up', 'finale', 'were', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'are', 'delightful', 'watch', 'film', 'Molina', 'golden', 'way', 'words', 'line', 'father', 'plea', 'daughter', 'understand', 'point', 'view', 'where', 'truly', 'coming', 'Thompson', 'also', 'be', 'very', 'convincing', 'Headmistress', 'Jenny', 'school', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'very', 'deeply', 'Jenny', 'future.I', 'think', 'film', 'almost', 'completely', 'carried', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'back', 'great', 'talent', 'young', 'actress', 'play', 'likable', 'even', 'lovable', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'who', 'anything', 'perfect', 'own', 'flaws', 'think', 'recent', 'comparisons', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'are', 'spot', 'oscar', 'nomination', 'looming', 'corner', 'so', 'believable', 'convincing', 'part', 'quite', 'literally', 'heart', 'soul', 'nearly', 'single', 'scene', 'even', 'sometimes', 'especially', 'when', 'not', 'saying', 'word', 'simply', 'changing', 'expression', 'certain', 'way', 'staring', 'wonder', 'world']",N/A

In a movie filled with big name actors, newcomer Mulligan outshines them all and in a stunning performance that makes her a near lock for Best Actress nomination.  Set in post-war and pre-swing England, Mulligan brilliantly portrays a sheltered young female attempting to avoid the mundane and repressive lifestyle already laid out for her and seemingly every other young girl in England during this time.Mulligan's character Jenny is wise beyond her years and is being pushed along by her parents in pursuit of an education at Oxford.  When she meets David (Peter Sarsgaard), her world is turned upside down. He offers her a lifestyle of glamour, adventure, and sophistication that she has always wanted. She becomes blinded by all the glitz and glamour of this lavish lifestyle that Peter and his friends live. Seeing the limitations of women at this time, she begins to wonder what she is really working towards in her endless studies and cello lessons.The pivotal scene that really displays the heart of Jenny's troubles and the film's core message is when her father, who has been pushing her all along to get perfect grades in all her classes so that she can get into Oxford, admittedly says how she wouldn't really need to go to Oxford if she were to marry Peter, or essentially anyone who could financially provide for her.  What is she really working towards if all her studies and schooling mean nothing as long as she can find a wealthy enough man to marry? She is both scared and frustrated that all this hard work and dedication she has given to her schooling could ultimately result in her leading a boring life.  David represents an opportunity to avoid this and live a life filled with jazz-clubs, expensive auctions and trips to France.You can see the ending coming from a mile away, but the film is so well crafted and the acting so genuine that you can't help but be engaged from beginning to end.

Keefer,"[0, 0]","What do you do if you are 16, an only child whose parents smother you, and you long for the sophisticated, expansive world beyond your school gates? You accept a ride, and relationship, with an older man when he makes an appearance. It's the 1960's and Jenny's (Carey Mulligan) trajectory is leading towards Oxford. Until David (Peter Saargard), twice her age, interrupts it. After accepting a ride home with him, he charms her parents into letting him take her to concerts and dinners and even trips. He has sophisticated and elegant friends who talk about subjects beyond A-levels.There's something slightly ""off"" about David, but Jenny and her parents can't quite see it. Jenny's father (Alfred Molina) is the perfect bumpkin foil to David's smooth sophistication. David chats them up, and seduces them as well. He seduces the audience too - we would be tempted to go for a ride with him, so understand Jenny and her parents' capitulation. Where will this all end?In 'an education' of course. In more ways than one. Jenny learns about the world and wiles. Normally a movie like this would end rather darkly, and you would ponder how another young life was ruined by exploitation. But I loved the ending in this movie, based upon a real life story by Lynn Barber, in which Jenny gets a second chance. A stern but temperate headmistress (played fantastically by Emma Thompson) and a sympathetic teacher Miss Stubbs (Olivia Williams) craft a different kind of education for her.Did life end happily for Lynn Barber? She says of her experience in THE GUARDIAN: ""What did I get from Simon (aka David in the film)? An education - the thing my parents always wanted me to have. I learned a lot in my two years with Simon. I learned about expensive restaurants and luxury hotels and foreign travel, I learned about antiques and Bergman films and classical music. All this was useful when I went to Oxford - I could read a menu, I could recognise a fingerbowl, I could follow an opera, I was not a complete hick. But actually there was a much bigger bonus than that. My experience with Simon entirely cured my craving for sophistication. By the time I got to Oxford, I wanted nothing more than to meet kind, decent, straightforward boys my own age, no matter if they were gauche or virgins. I would marry one eventually and stay married all my life and for that, I suppose, I have Simon to thank.But there were other lessons Simon taught me that I regret learning. I learned not to trust people; I learned not to believe what they say but to watch what they do; I learned to suspect that anyone and everyone is capable of ""living a lie"". I came to believe that other people - even when you think you know them well - are ultimately unknowable. Learning all this was a good basis for my subsequent career as an interviewer, but not, I think, for life. It made me too wary, too cautious, too ungiving. I was damaged by my education.""Most of us have been taken in by unscrupulous folks sometime in our life and have to get 'an education' in being wary, cautious and a tad ungiving. Maybe it leaves more emotional scars when you are 16 instead of 26. This film captures the euphoria and misery of an education like this. It demonstrates that what begins wrongly, doesn't end well.

1281392,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B002ONC9NC,mirasreviews,"[2, 5]","""An Education"" is a handsome early 1960s coming-of-age tale, adapted from a true story, that is ultimately not as ambitious as it should be. Jenny (Carey Mulligan) is a 16-year-old schoolgirl, the only child of Jack (Alfred Molina) and Marjorie (Cara Seymour), living in Twickenham, London in 1961. She aspires to read English at Oxford, and her parents seem to think of little else. Caught in the rain with her cello one day, a man named David (Peter Sarsgaard) in a red Bristol sportscar gives her a lift. And then he asks her to a concert. Jenny craves more adventure than her constrained bourgeois life offers, so she jumps at the opportunity to go to nightclubs, European vacations, and the races with David and his friends Danny (Dominic Cooper) and Helen (Rosamund Pike). David's charm even elicits her parents' approval. Predictably, David is not what he seems.This script was written by Nick Hornby from a 2003 article by Lynn Barber in the literary magazine ""Granta"". Barber made her name as an interviewer, but in the article she recounted a misadventure she had as a teenager, when she dated an older man named Simon Goldman, who turned out to be a con artist. Barber was less conned by him than her parents, who actually wanted their daughter to marry the man. ""An Education"" is so simplified and sanitized that it's better to think of it as fiction. Barber was more assertive and less a victim than her cinematic namesake and Simon more roguish. Barber apparently didn't even like him very much but hung around for the company of Danny and Helen. In the movie, David seems to have no personality and Jenny no edge.I don't object to fictionalizing, but this script is just a very long stay-in-school public service message. Admonitions that Jenny would be ""ruining her life"" by marrying instead of going to university are anachronistic. Who would have said that to a young woman in 1961? The film scolds Jenny for choosing a life of adventure over an English degree, which may or may not be wise but hardly has moral implication, while it tiptoes around the fact that she's running with crooks and profiting from their misdeeds. Lynn Barber's story is good material. But Hornby has taken the meat out of it and replaced it with, basically, mush. And preposterous dialogue. It's innocuous, predictable, and rather bland. Alfred Molina is very good as Jenny's domineering but naive father, as is Rosamund Pike as ditzy Helen. But watching the film, I had the persistent feeling that there is something interesting here, but they're telling the wrong story.The DVD (Sony 2010): ""The Making of An Education"" (9 min) is brief interviews with the director, producers, Nick Hornby, and cast, who talk about story, characters, and the film as metaphor for the cultural changes of the 1960s without saying much. ""Walking the Red Carpet"" (8 min) is red carpet interviews from the Los Angeles premiere of the film a Grauman's Egyptian Theater. There is an audio commentary with director Lone Scherfig and actors Carey Mulligan and Peter Sarsgaard. It is fairly constant but not very technical. They recall shooting the film, comment on the scenes, and occasionally talk about a technical challenge. There are also 11 deleted scenes and a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min).

The film aims to depict a situation, a period in a young woman's life, without moralizing and without making anyone into either victim or villain, and does so brilliantly.It is a rich and intriguing film, that brings the Britain of the 1960's to life.  Director Lone Sherfig (who directed the darkly comicWilbur (Wants to Kill Himself)as well as the playful Dogme 95 filmItalian for Beginners) manages to capture quite nicely the era, and the subtleties of language and attitude that mark class distinctions of that time.  At the same time, while certain attitudes depicted in the film mark it as past, the issues it raises and the freshness of their delivery make the film seem quite contemporary.  (On that note, I couldn't help but consider for a moment that Carey Mulligan's Jenny is much like a more refined and elegant version of the spunky and sarcasticJunoas played by Ellen Page).

Although you see her studying  in her room again, we felt that was handled a bit too neatly and quickly.  Her ex-teacher obviously helped her, but how? Perhaps that didn't need elaboration but it seemed too simple, especially with how devastated she was.  And, David just walks (drives) away in the end and he's never seen again. Perhaps too, this is an appropriate end for a creepy role.  We were also disturbed at how easily her parents allowed her to be whisked away by an older man who was blatantly lying to everyone.

Set in London, in the `60s at a time just before the Beatles arrived to shake things up, we meet Carey Mulligan, a student at an all-girl high school.  She is super smart & witty (naturally, because she will grow up to be her own biographer and write the book upon which the movie is based), and this has made her restless and reckless.  She's very interested in boys, but seldom gets to meet any that stir any interest in her.  She's a sweet-faced girl who is just looking for the right opportunity to get into some serious mischief.She's the only child in a fairly lower-middle class family.  Her father (Alfred Molina) is deeply ambitious for her...and obsesses about her grades so that she can get into college.  He's nave about the world though, but runs his household as though he's the authority on all things.  In reality, he's such a tyrant because he's afraid to experience new and unfamiliar things.  Mom understands the restlessness of her daughter, but has assumed a passive role in the family...she sees more than she lets on, but she also does nothing about it.  So into this situation strides Peter Sarsgard, a charming, suave and sophisticated bachelor who is clearly MUCH older than Mulligan.  They meet one very rainy day when he gives her a ride home from her music lessons, and she is immediately charmed by his easy wit and urbane manner.  He clearly sees a girl who is very nave, but very much ready to let her hair down.He charms her parents (in scenes that are incredibly difficult to swallow...yes, he's charming and well-to-do...but the fact that she's perhaps 17 and he's clearly 30ish gives up a creepy vibe that I find hard to believe her parents don't pick up on), and soon the two are engaged in quite a crazy fling.  He introduces her to fine restaurants and bars and to another couple, consisting of another man who appears to be Peter's best friend and his girlfriend, an empty-headed blonde (Rosamund Pike, quite funny) who is very upfront in admitting that she's along for the money and glamour.  The four become inseparable, and Carey begins to concoct lies to get away from home and spend more time with these folks.  She eventually devises a doozy of a lie that convinces her father that she's going to meet CS Lewis and visit Oxford...when she's really going away with this creepy guy in order to loose her virginity.  And she eventually discovers that these two men of leisure are con men and thieves...yet is easily convinced to stay with them.  She's enjoying the glamorous life, after all.Eventually, as you might suppose, things are exposed and the carefully constructed lies fall apart.  The entire story is so frivolous that it's hard to believe the movie can be engrossing.  But most of the performers give such excellent performances that for the time of the movie, you can overlook the fact that these are mostly petty thieves and liars, or terrible parents who are willing to look the other way as their child engages in a highly inappropriate relationship because it might open some doors for her.The film looks great, with excellent period costuming and detail.  London feels like a city on the edge of bursting away from the staid, old-fashioned past into a center for a youthful revolution.But it is the acting that really makes the film work.  Alfred Molina, finally playing a British character, is really quite wonderful as the father.  Towards the end of the movie, he has one small scene, sitting outside the door of  his daughter's room, that is simply the best one-minute of movie writing and acting this year.  It's a tiny little moment, but wrenching in its perfect evocation of what it means for this man to have his heart broken by his beloved daughter.  Sarsgard is good in his role, but hugely unlikable.  He certainly carries a creepy, pedophile vibe...and I still maintain that he would have turned her parents off.However, this is young Carey Mulligan's movie and she utterly commands it.  Surely an Oscar nomination awaits her.  Her character is so trivial and unlikable...yet Mulligan makes us see the way her innate intelligence and curiosity get the best of her.  She does bad things because she is compelled to EXPERIENCE something outside her limited world.  And when she is inevitably disappointed, we can feel the anguish and the realization that she is indeed a little girl still.  Great stuff.I'd also like to mention that Emma Thompson appears in a small, but hugely satisfying performance as the headmistress of the school.  She has one of the best lines of the year (if you've seen the trailers for the film, you've seen it).  Mulligan says something like, ""I suppose you think I'm a ruined woman"" and Thompson throws back, with the most casually sweet vitriol, ""Oh, you're not a woman.""  You gotta see it to believe it.I heartily recommend this movie if you're interested in some very nice performances.  It is slow paced and not a great deal of import happens.  For me, when it was over,  I realized how truly nasty so many of the people really were, and the charm wore off quickly.  I know for others, the glow lasted much longer.  Either way, I think the film is well worth supporting.",4,Great performances in service of a trite little story.,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,5301,"['EDUCATION', 'really', 'nice', 'performances',

Such is the plot of many a coming-of-age tale, and the general trajectory which this one follows. Set during London in the early 1960's, the story is about the winding path which Jenny (Carey Mulligan) takes to womanhood. For what it is, the film is fine. The performances are all good, the film is photographed well and the soundtrack is eclectic and memorable. Too bad the story isn't. Carey Mulligan does an excellent job of playing a budding ingenue and Peter Sarsgaard plays the slimy, deceitful role that he plays so well. Emma Thompson also shows up for a few scenes as the headmistress of Jenny's school. Would I watch it again? No, but I wasn't terribly disappointed. AN EDUCATION has a title with more than one meaning, and I was appreciative that film had at least that much depth, even if the period setting had a lot of retrograde social mores on display.

1281409,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002ONC9NC,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","Jenny Mellor is a London schoolgirl, circa 1961, who has dreams of one day majoring in English Literature at Oxford University.  But, at age 16, the wise-beyond-her-years Jenny wants more out of life than just the tightly regimented routine of book-learning and cello-playing that her father assures her is essential to achieving her goal.  She yearns for a time when she will be able to think her own thoughts, be her own person, and live her own life.  That's where David Goldman comes in.  David is a dapper, smooth-talking, enticingly enigmatic older gentleman who invites Jenny into the tantalizing world of adulthood - of classical concerts, fine-dining, alcohol and cigarettes, and, of course, that mysterious, forbidden thing known as sex.  But Jenny soon learns that growing up comes with a price - primarily the loss of that moral certitude that comes with youthful innocence - and that the adult world can be a great deal crueler and trickier to maneuver through than a nave, headstrong, know-it-all teenager may be willing to acknowledge going in.Astutely adapted by Nick Hornby, ""An Education"" is based on a memoir by Lynne Barber, an award-winning British journalist who attended Oxford before becoming a writer for ""The Daily Telegraph,"" ""The Observer"" and many other reputable publications.  Barber's tale is reflective of the kind of choices women were permitted to have in that pre-Women's Lib era of the early 1960s.  Even an abnormally bright and gifted young lady like Jenny was forced to look upon an education at Oxford more as an end in itself than as a means to some greater end.  Every adult Jenny queries as to just what exactly it is she is supposed to do with her life once she's fulfilled her requirements for graduation is left hemming and hawing in response to the question.  This applies to her teacher (Olivia Williams) and principal (Emma Thompson) at school as well as to her own parents who are stuck in a stifling, humdrum middle class existence of their own.  No wonder her head is set spinning by a man who appears to have risen above all that dreary domesticity and who can provide entr&eacute;e for her into all the priciest restaurants and poshest nightclubs in London and who can even offer her romantic get-aways to Paris on a moment`s notice.  But this is just the beginning of Jenny's ""education,"" as she slowly comes to realize that people are not always who they say they are, and that there is a lot more to being ""wise"" in the ways of the world than what one can learn from books.Jenny is played by Carey Mulligan in a star-making turn that earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress of 2009.  The comparisons between Ms. Mulligan and Audrey Hepburn have been noted by all who have seen or written about this film, so let me just state that her performance here is rich in grace, charm, subtlety and feistiness, and that she is most definitely a natural and commanding presence on the screen.  As David, Peter Sarsgaard is cagily manipulative without becoming sleazy or smarmy in the process, and Alfred Molina makes his mark as the well-intentioned but often bumbling and self-centered father who plays the role of stern and concerned parent - except at the moment when it matters most.Kudos also go to Lone Scherfig for her astute, solid and polished direction, to the movie's beautifully realized sense of place and period, and to a wonderful animated opening credit sequence that, appropriate to the era in which the movie is set, recalls the late great Saul Bass at his finest.",4,Educating Jenny,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,3538,"['Jenny', 'Mellor', 'London', 'schoolgirl', 'circa', '1961', 'who', 'dreams', 'one', 'day', 'majoring', 'English', 'Literature', 'Oxford', 'University', 'age', '16', 'wise-beyond-her-years', 'Jenny', 'more', 'life', 'just', 'tightly', 'regimented', 'routine', 'book-learning', 'cello-playing', 'father', 'essential', 'achieving', 'goal', 'time', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'think', 'own', 'thoughts', 'be', 'own', 'person', 'live', 'own', 'life', 'where', 'David', 'Goldman', 'David', 'dapper', 'smooth-talking', 'enticingly', 'enigmatic', 'older', 'gentleman', 'who', 'Jenny', 'tantalizing', 'world', 'adulthood', 'classical', 'concerts', 'fine-dining', 'alcohol', 'cigarettes', 'course', 'mysterious', 'forbidden', 'thing', 'known', 'sex', 'Jenny', 'soon', 'growing', 'up', 'price', 'primarily', 'loss', 'moral', 'certitude', 'youthful', 'innocence', 'adult', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'deal', 'crueler', 'trickier', 'maneuver', 'nave', 'headstrong', 'know-it-all', 'teenager', 'may', 'be', 'willing', 'acknowledge', 'going', 'in.Astutely', 'adapted', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'Education', 'based', 'memoir', 'Lynne', 'Barber', 'award-winning', 'British', 'journalist', 'who', 'attended', 'Oxford', 'becoming', 'writer', 'Daily', 'Telegraph', 'Observer', 'many', 'other', 'reputable', 'publications', 'Barber', 'tale', 'reflective', 'kind', 'choices', 'women', 'were', 'permitted', 'have', 'pre-Women', 'Lib', 'era', 'early', '1960s', 'Even', 'abnormally', 'bright', 'gifted', 'young', 'lady', 'Jenny', 'was', 'forced', 'look', 'education', 'Oxford', 'more', 'end', 'means', 'greater', 'end', 'adult', 'Jenny', 'queries', 'just', 'what', 'exactly', 'supposed', 'do', 'life', 'fulfilled', 'requirements', 'graduation', 'left', 'hemming', 'hawing', 'response', 'question', 'teacher', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'principal', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'school', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'stuck', 'stifling', 'humdrum', 'middle', 'class', 'existence', 'own', 'wonder', 'head', 'set', 'spinning', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'risen', 'dreary', 'domesticity', 'who', 'can', 'provide', 'entr', 'eacute', 'e', 'priciest', 'restaurants', 'poshest', 'nightclubs', 'London', 'who', 'can', 'even', 'offer', 'romantic', 'get-aways', 'Paris', 'moment', 's', 'notice', 'just', 'beginning', 'Jenny', 'education', 'slowly', 'realize', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'who', 'say', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'being', 'wise', 'ways', 'world', 'what', 'one', 'can', 'learn', 'books.Jenny', 'played', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'star-making', 'turn', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', '2009', 'comparisons', 'Ms.', 'Mulligan', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'have', 'been', 'noted', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'written', 'film', 'so', 'let', 'just', 'state', 'performance', 'here', 'rich', 'grace', 'charm', 'subtlety', 'feistiness', 'most', 'definitely', 'natural', 'commanding', 'presence', 'screen', 'David', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'cagily', 'manipulative', 'becoming', 'sleazy', 'smarmy', 'process', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'mark', 'well-intentioned', 'often', 'bumbling', 'self-centered', 'father', 'who', 'role', 'stern', 'concerned', 'parent', 'except', 'moment', 'when', 'most.Kudos', 'also', 'go', 'Lone', 'Scherfig', 'astute', 'solid', 'polished', 'direction', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'sense', 'place', 'period', 'wonderful', 'animated', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence', 'appropriate', 'era', 'movie', 'set', 'late', 'great', 'Saul', 'Bass', 'finest']",N/A
1281410,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B002ONC9NC,Samuel McKewon,"[1, 2]","It's almost indecent, in the wake of discovering the next great actor, Carey Mulligan, to suggest the movie that will serve as her springboard, ""An Edcuation"" is a flirt at best and a bit of a flimsy lark at worst. Well, it is, and that's OK, because where the film fudges, it does so in deference to Mulligan, whose work serves as the best female performance of the year, and just short of Christoph Waltz for both the genders. She is too good for the film, saving it and consigning it to mediocrity.Closely based on British journalist Lynn Barber's sharp, simple memoir - with a couple key, unfortunate differences - ""An Education"" is set in 1961 London and features Mulligan as 16-year-old Jenny, a private schoolgirl with working class parents (Alfred Molina and Cara Seymour) and two eyes (plus their four) on Oxford. She's walking home one rainy afternoon when a thirtysomething chap named David (Peter Sarsgaard) pulls over his Bristol and offers a ride. He's witty about it, he seems cultured, and he appears to mean little harm. Jenny gets in. David warms up. Not long after, he's taking her out for supper with his two friends, Danny (Dominic Cooper) and Helen (Rosamund Pike).In short time, David reveals to Jenny ""the world,"" - restaurants, jazz clubs, foreign films, sex - and Jenny happily indulges. In fact, at 16 (and then 17) she appears more at ease in the world than David does. And yet she's charmed by him. So are her willfully-blind parents. David's other, less flattering shoe will drop, of course - though not by his choosing.Mulligan radiates warmth, intelligence and good humor, the last of which comes in handy when Nick Hornby's screenplay decides to turn a clever phrase. Cute without being distracting, she's good with banter, and excels within the screenplay's rat-a-tat, headlong momentum. Although 21 during filming - and 24 now - Mulligan can still (just barely) pass for a bright, cute, lovable know-it-all, which Jenny is to her parents, David and her favorite English teacher Miss Stubbs (Olivia Williams). Poised on the twin edge of feminism and womanhood, Jenny seems a perfect early entrant for both, and yet Mulligan, wisely, nurtures the vulnerable side enough that, when the screw inevitably turns, it hurts the audience as much as it does Jenny. She's just a girl, after all, standing in front of a middle-aged, lecherous thief, asking him to...Barber is less sympathetic on herself, for what it's worth; the ""Simon"" in her memoir is short, fat and smelling of cigars - more of a gateway to excitement than a paramour. The casting of Sarsgaard - experienced playing duplicitous creeps in ""Flightplan"" and ""The Skeleton Key"" - seems right, but Hornby and director Lone Scherfig choose only to convey Jenny's sincerity, while pretending David can dash with the best of them. Barber's memoir admits to toying with her older lover - or so she thought - while nearly sleepwalking her way into bigamy; the movie frames the relationship as a schoolgirl crush gone sour.And in those changes, minor but significant, ""An Education"" turns into treacle, especially in its final 20 minutes as it tidies up and makes nice. That it's fairly effortless in its denouement is to Mulligan's credit.

1281412,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B002ONC9NC,Sean Curley,"[3, 5]","""An Education"" is a compact little British drama that has been making the rounds in 2009, earning favourable reviews with a particular emphasis on the starmaking performance of its lead actress, which has already been recognized by numerous awards organizations with nominations.  Directed by Lone Scherfig, this film boasts considerably more pleasures than just the work of Carey Mulligan, though it is Mulligan's performance that will be remembered in the long-run (hopefully in what will be a lengthy career on the screen).  The film comes with a screenplay by popular British writer Nick Hornby, adapted from a memoir by journalist Lynn Barber that describes experiences approximate to the ones depicted here (standard allowances being made for dramatics).  Some plot details are discussed, so be warned.Jenny (Mulligan) is a 16-year-old aspirant Oxfordian in early 1960s Britain (which is more or less still 50s Britain; the era we think of as the ""60s"" culturally didn't really start until about midway through the decade), whose parents (Alfred Molina and Cara Seymour) have been rigourously preparing her to achieve entry into the nation's top university, to the extent of mapping out her life to conform to Oxford's entrance requirements (her father informs her at one point that while she must play the cello, thus enabling her to list it as a hobby, it isn't required that she devote so much time as to actually become really good at it).  Jenny is grasping for whatever straws of sophistication she can find in this rather bland atmosphere (anything French, for example; the albums of Juliette Greco) when she encounters David (Peter Sarsgaard), an older man who soon whisks her into a much more glamourous existence alongside his friends Danny and Helen (Dominic Cooper and Rosamund Pike, the latter having costarred with Mulligan in 2005's ""Pride & Prejudice"" film; Mulligan was Kitty, Pike Jane).  This new world eventually dazzles her parents, but ruffles the feathers of her school authorities (Emma Thompson and Olivia Williams) in different ways.  Inevitably, things will go awry.Mulligan's performance has attracted most of the critical and awards attention, not undeservedly.  A minor presence prior to this, this is the sort of performance that opens doors for actors, and one can only hope Mulligan will take advantage of it.  That said, she's supported more than adequately by the rest of the cast, with Alfred Molina being particularly strong as her father.  Also notable is Rosamund Pike, who's clearly enjoying herself playing the marvelously dim Helen; and Peter Sarsgaard (sporting what appears to be a credible British accent; being Canadian, I will of course defer to the judgment of actual Britons who wish to disagree), who has to walk a particularly fine line.  His character is, really, a creep, but he has to simultaneously be charming enough to sell the idea that anyone else would put up with him while creepy enough that the film doesn't glamourize this sort of relationship.  He pulls it off.  Plot-wise, there are a few weak parts; I thought it was a bit excessive to have David and Danny go around randomly lifting stuff, in addition to their more important morality problems.  And, as has been noted elsewhere, the film doesn't end especially well.  It doesn't quite seem to know how to wrap things up, and Jenny's recovery after hitting nadir feels rather perfunctory (not to mention, surely it's not just Oxford or bust).

Look, I liked the film on the whole, I mean I gave it three stars, but for some reason I was left thinking, uh was that it?..Was that the movie that got an Oscar nomination?  It had fine actors, starting with the great Alfred Molina and what a glorious treat to see Emma Thompson pop up, but the lead actress seemed at times the innocent and at times she acted like the 25 year old she actually is, it just made her seem unrealistic, especially when she dressing down her parents; I mean what girl in 1961 England would dare!! talk to her father so coursely?..I had not realized Peter Sarsgaard was in this, and let me state for the record that I can't look at him without thinking of Boys Don't Cry, a film he was revolting in, so let's just say I was not pleased to lay my eyes on him.  I have to admit he was game in this, and played the part quite well, though I never bought his charm for a minute, I kept thinking, why are her parents so enthralled with this loser, he was so obviously not what he seems.  I mean, couldnt the dad have hired a person to looking into who this 35 year old man actually was, instead of taking his 16!! year old daughters word for it?. What father allowes his 16 year old daughter to go to Paris!!! with a 35 year old man he barely knows?!!  At the beginning of the film her father is very autocratic and direct, but when Sarsgarrd arrives Molina becomes a stooge, a Beta male fool, it just didnt jive.  Yeah, the movie tries to make it look like Sarsgaard is charming and charismatic, but I never bought that the parents wouild have been so naive and frankly dumb.

1281414,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B002ONC9NC,Sheryl Fechter,"[3, 3]","This lovely controversial film dances out on the piano keys of Floyd Cramer and starts with a lively, young and happy tone.  The soundtrack (Paul Englishby) then becomes smoky and faintly erotic while detailing a relationship that plays with the boundaries.  Director Lone Scherfig pulls the emotions of the character of Jenny to equal anything of a much larger scale.  Her depth of feeling matches that of Britain's own coming of age story in the early 1960's.Carey Mulligan (Oscar nomination) comes prepared and is so convincing as Jenny. She does not want to settle for what she feels will be a boring and complacent life after University and dreams out loud of better things.  Quite conveniently, David just happens to come along at the right time with an offer that Jenny cannot refuse; Himself. Coming from her young and intelligent beyond-her-years point of view, this is so easy to understand.Peter Sarsgaard brings a whole character study to David along with an emotionally vulnerable side.  He is able to seduce Jenny's parents (Alfred Molina - a standout as her father) right on board as easily as he influences her with a tall-tale of an author and dreams of Paris.Jenny and David quickly become a couple.  An older man and a confident, headstrong schoolgirl on the verge of graduating, then onward to Oxford.  She takes a sharp left, against the advice of her Headmistress (Emma Thompson) and favorite teacher, Miss Stubbs (Olivia Williams), and decides to go to Paris, among other key considerations with David and his friends.  Jenny desperately wants to be an adult, live in a glamorous setting and stretch out her arms to embrace life.Their age difference does not condescend you as the story remains plausible; warm and positive possibly in its absolute full conclusion, after the gut wrenching plot twist (""it's just another one of David's muddles and misunderstandings"").  It leaves the cast, along with the viewer, reconciling their scattered feelings and then allows Jenny a logical discernment for her ongoing life.",5,"""I'm Trying To Figure Out What Makes Good Things Good"" - Jenny",1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,2038,"['lovely', 'controversial', 'film', 'dances', 'out', 'piano', 'keys', 'Floyd', 'Cramer', 'lively', 'young', 'happy', 'tone', 'soundtrack', 'Paul', 'Englishby', 'then', 'smoky', 'faintly', 'erotic', 'detailing', 'relationship', 'boundaries', 'Director', 'Lone', 'Scherfig', 'emotions', 'character', 'Jenny', 'equal', 'anything', 'much', 'larger', 'scale', 'depth', 'feeling', 'matches', 'Britain', 'own', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'early', ""1960's.Carey"", 'Mulligan', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'prepared', 'so', 'convincing', 'Jenny', 'not', 'want', 'settle', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'boring', 'complacent', 'life', 'University', 'out', 'loud', 'better', 'things', 'Quite', 'conveniently', 'David', 'just', 'come', 'along', 'right', 'time', 'offer', 'Jenny', 'can', 'not', 'refuse', 'Himself', 'Coming', 'young', 'intelligent', 'beyond-her-years', 'point', 'view', 'so', 'easy', 'understand.Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'whole', 'character', 'study', 'David', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'able', 'seduce', 'Jenny', 'parents', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'standout', 'father', 'right', 'board', 'easily', 'tall-tale', 'author', 'dreams', 'Paris.Jenny', 'David', 'quickly', 'become', 'couple', 'older', 'man', 'confident', 'headstrong', 'schoolgirl', 'verge', 'graduating', 'then', 'onward', 'Oxford', 'sharp', 'left', 'advice', 'Headmistress', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'favorite', 'teacher', 'Miss', 'Stubbs', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'decides', 'go', 'Paris', 'other', 'key', 'considerations', 'David', 'friends', 'Jenny', 'desperately', 'be', 'adult', 'live', 'glamorous', 'setting', 'stretch', 'arms', 'embrace', 'life.Their', 'age', 'difference', 'not', 'condescend', 'story', 'plausible', 'warm', 'positive', 'possibly', 'absolute', 'full', 'conclusion', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'plot', 'twist', 'just', 'one', 'David', 'muddles', 'misunderstandings', 'cast', 'viewer', 'reconciling', 'scattered', 'feelings', 'then', 'Jenny', 'logical', 'discernment', 'ongoing', 'life']",N/A

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[3, 4]","You are probably reading this review after having read other reviews many of which - in my opinion - give away too much of the plot .  Like Jenny (the lead character in the film, played by first time actress Carey Mulligan), this is a film of discovery, and the less you know going in the better. Yes, it's a coming of age story, set in London in 1961. This is a period well known by Nick Hornby, who wrote the script (and is responsible for a similar sixties period film: ""High Fidelity""). Hornby based his script on an autobiography by Lynn Barber and the film is directed by a woman : Lone Scherfig. So this gives it a nice balance in the sexual politics department. Jenny is a high school student - in her senior year - and meats an older man - who might - or might not  -be the one for her. That's all you need to know to enjoy this film. The Oscar nominations will tell you immediately that it is high quality.The DVD special features include which is now considered the standard ""Making of"" featurette (eight minutes) in which the actors on the set tell why they joined the project. Another eight-minute featurette ""On The Red Carpet"" consists of more recent interviews at the Hollywood premiere of the film (after making the ""film festival"" circuit). Nothing revealing there. There are 12 deleted scenes (16 minutes total), most of which are too brief to matter. The most interesting deleted scene here for Hornby fans is a brief scene in a record store. There is also an alternate ending that, when you see it, I think you'll agree it wouldn't have worked.There is a minor plot device about one of the characters being Jewish. This seems out of place and adds nothing to the story.This is the kind of film you can best appreciate at home (even on a smaller screen). It gives you time to connect with the story and the characters without disruption you might find in a theater. Enjoy it! Discover it!

1281418,A359IT81FBX64Y,B002ONC9NC,Steven Mason,"[3, 5]","""An Education"" is just ""a movie,"" and by that I mean it could (and should) have been better. It takes place in 1961 London. There is Jenny, a very bright and lovely almost 17-year-old girl, an only child, in her final year at a private school, taking her A-levels, on track to Oxford. Jenny's parents, at first, are depicted as boring, stodgy, humorless, cold, grasping, and a bit dense, really. They aren't wealthy - Jenny's father works for a living - they are what we would today call lower upper middle class. Jenny's father relentlessly pushes her to study hard and excel, but his interest in education seems only to be a means for his daughter to meet the right sort of ""chap"" who will, through marriage, raise the entire family higher up on the social scale.At school Jenny seems to be the only student who shows any serious academic interest, as well as interest in art, music, and French, subjects which, as her father says, are ""not on the syllabus."" Jenny has big dreams of a life well lived, of hobnobbing with intellectuals, of romance and adventure. In short, the opposite of her parents' life and that of the teachers at her school.Then Jenny meets an older man, maybe forty. She's a bit smitten with him from the beginning because he is handsome, charming, rich, funny, worldly, artsy, and there are ""so many things he'd like to show her."" With other adult friends, they go to concerts, dinners at chic night clubs, art auctions. Jenny is just 16, but with her knowledge of art and music, her fluent French, her quick-witted intellectual insights and humor, and her genuine, non-jaded appreciation for ""the good life,"" she fits right in with the freewheeling adults. Her school performance begins to suffer. Jenny's parents aren't concerned, because David, the older man, has charmed the socks off of them, too. The parents think that David is Jenny's ticket (and theirs, too) to higher social status.Now it's time for movie spoilers - if you don't want them, stop here. Jenny begins to discover that David (and his partner, Danny) are nothing more than scammers and con artists. That's how they make all of their money. When Jenny realizes this, her first reaction is to leave, but David somehow convinces her that there are ""really clever girls like her,"" and then, not so clever ones like him who have to make their living as criminals. In an echo of what Jenny's father had said, David says that ""money doesn't grow on trees."" You need lots of money to buy expensive clothes, go to concerts, and visit Paris. David says, with a charming self-effacing smile and a shrug of the shoulders, ""This is who I am."" I would have expected this entreaty, as open and sincere as it was, to inspire Jenny to run, not walk, away from this man. Even if she were willing to overlook his taking advantage of other people, how could she ever expect to trust him? How could she enjoy the high life knowing it was purchased with tainted money?The reason is that Jenny believes the only alternative is death, a life worse than death, such as the life of her parents or her teachers. She believes that even if she were to go to Oxford, after graduation she would still face a deadly boring life, and all of her study and hard work would be for naught.Jenny quits school and accepts David's proposal of marriage. Jenny's parents are ecstatic. As mentioned earlier, the only reason Jenny's father wanted Jenny to go to Oxford was for her to meet and marry a fine gentleman. So much the better that she had managed to do so without the expense of Oxford.But then, in the midst of celebrations for the engagment, we discover something new about David, something which Jenny is not willing to overlook. No, it's not more criminal activity. It's the oldest of all stories, the almost trite bane of older men seducing younger women - he's married, with kids. In fact, David's happy little family lives right around the corner from Jenny's house. David tells Jenny that he was going to tell her when the time was right. He says that he doesn't know why she's making such a fuss about it. But Jenny has SOME principles after all. She realizes that she's thrown away a year of school and her chance to get into Oxford, for a married man who really had no intention of marrying her. You see, he's done this before, and some of the other mistresses have had children. As I said, an old story.What I would have liked to see is a new story. I would have liked to see Jenny choose to leave David, without the obvious obstructions of betrayal and marriage. She didn't leave him because she didn't want to be with him; she left him because she couldn't be with him. She didn't make a choice, the choice was made for her. I didn't expect this story to take the easy way out, and I felt disappointed when it did.There is a happy ending. Jenny repeats her year of studies and gets into Oxford. But one more note about that: There is no adult in the story who can provide a decent answer to Jenny's legitimate question about what all the hard work is for, and what makes life worth living, rather than boring. Of all the people who could have answered that question and helped Jenny avoid some of the mistakes she made, it was Miss Stubbs, her English Lit teacher, a teacher who really cared about Jenny and the most intelligent and level-headed adult in the film. But for reasons not at all clear, Miss Stubbs allows Jenny to go off the deep end.I give this movie 3 stars. I enjoyed watching it, but it turned out to be the ""same old same old,"" a young woman seduced and fooled by an older married man. Jenny should have left him for being a criminal. After all, isn't being a criminal worse than being a philanderer? :-)",3,A movie,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,5699,"['Education', 'just', 'movie', 'mean', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better',

This is a story of a pathological ephebophile seducing an innocent girl. Unlike Lolita, which was stunning, our main character (Peter) is a manipulative liar. He gets his kicks off getting away with lies. Our first introduction to him in the rain is probably a calculated lie, every interaction with the parents is a lie. In fact, it's all about him and what he wants. He doesn't seem to care about this girl or the fact that he is wrecking her life. It's pathetic.Peter's ""friend's"" girlfriend is the only one with any sense. She sees that Jenny is just a kid, but everyone else around her treats her like she belongs. Nobody bats an eye at the totally inappropriate coupling of an old man with a teenager.I thought Carrey Mulligan, who plays Jenny, did a good job of making her goofy and innocent. She made me remember what it was like to want to be grown and have no clue what it meant.What made me turn it off is that the whole thing just disgusted me. I couldn't sit there and watch a narcissist molest a young girl. The difference between this and Lolita is that Humbert was conflicted and in his way, he loved Lolita.

1281421,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B002ONC9NC,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[0, 0]","Movie - 4.5Every now and then, I'm sure people find a movie that manages to fly under the radar and gets a lot less credit than it deserves, or in layman's terms, ""a diamond in the rough."" I discovered such a gem when deciding to give An Education a rent based solely on the one time I saw a trailer for it on another Sony BD. Aside from the presence of the always-proficient class act, Alfred Molina, nothing else at the time really struck me as ""wow, I have to see this."" I knew the movie would be a British-produced, coming of age, slice-of-life, semi-period piece about a girl, but that's it. Thankfully, the film itself easily defied a lot of the preconceived notions I had going in. An Education is a quaint, yet brilliantly written and directed story not just about a girl becoming a woman, but about the naivety, discovery, and eventual hardship I think all people are likely to feel and experience at some point in their lives. The script has a lot of charm and subtlety to it, which is wonderfully delivered and acted by (newcomers, to me) Carey Mulligan, Peter Sarsgaard, and for what few moments she has, Olivia Williams. The entire production actually reminds me of a lower-budgeted work that somehow just happened to be a really good thing in the end. It's neither flashy, nor does it feel like an exuberant amount of money went into any particular shot. But for some reason, it just works and feels like grade-A film-making. I know Mulligan was nominated for Best Actress, and while I've yet to see Sandra Bullock in The Blind Side, I would definitely vouch for Ms. Mulligan's fine performance, here. For those curious to check this movie out, I would say go in with the expectations of a low-key romantic drama. But at the same time, put yourself in Mulligan's shoes at that age and ask yourself what you think you'd do if you were her. It may sound a bit far-fetched, maybe even juvenile if you're not in to this genre, but I certainly feel a little more educated after watching it.Video - 4.0As I mentioned about the non-flashy presentation of the film itself, An Education looks pretty good given the period it was set in, the conservative nature of that time, and the fact that this isn''t some high-budget Hollywood blockbuster. Colors for a majority of the film range somewhere between drab and ""one shiny moment"" where Mulligan wears a particularly extravagant dress. Vibrancy isn't a strong point of the art direction, but I actually think it compliments the film's thematic progression very well. Skin tones are accurate, if not a tad pale, but brighten and fill up a bit when the main characters get into the night clubs and visit Paris. Contrast and black levels are adequate throughout revealing a good amount of object detail and facial features as well, with a little noise here and there during the more darkly-lit scenes, but overall never feels distracting. It's a video transfer that accurately showcases the film's artistic attributes and is another great job by Sony.Audio - 4.5Much more pleasing in presentation is the DTS-HD 5.1 track. Dialogue is clear and unfaltering through the center channel, with a decent amount of sound effects for cars, doors, and footsteps kept mainly on the front sides. High and low ends are handled as best as they can be for the limited sound design, with separation being good enough and directionality sparse. I thought it was going to be a front-heavy track initially, but music immersion is where the audio really shines. Throughout the film, we're treated to various instances of period jazz, big band, and swing music that have a tremendous amount of buoyancy outputting from all the speakers. And the fact that it even emanates some subtle LFEs only makes it more fun to listen to. The score by Paul Englishby has a good pace to it and never feels too melodramatic or overdone in any way. All in all, the music department did a great job making up for what the sound effects department lacked in presence.Extras - 2.0Aside from the somewhat jovial commentary with director Scherfig and actors Mulligan and Sarsgaard, there's not much else in terms of special features. The commentary itself dibbles and dabbles at the technical processes of the filming, the acting, and alterations made between filming and the final product, but never really gets too focused. It makes for a good listen, but is probably not something I'd say has a lot of replay value. In addition, there are also a couple of paltry vignettes featuring the making-of and red carpet arrival, though they do very little for me that isn't either covered in the commentary or that I can deduce on my own. However, given the low-key marketing the film itself received, the studio probably felt it would be in the company's best interest to keep the extras at a minimum, which is too bad. There also deleted scenes and Sony trailers.Overall - 4.0This movie really caught me by surprise. I only saw the trailer once and had very little expectations going in. Thankfully, it surprised the heck out of me with how well-written and directed it was. My biggest surprise, however, was the discovery of Carey Mulligan. She has a very subtle appearance, but a very strong screen presence. I'm hoping this film will open a lot of doors for her in the future. Presented by Sony with excellent A/V specs, though a disappointing set of extras, An Education comes highly recommended for movie-goers wanting an engaging character drama.",4,An Education

1281423,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002ONC9NC,Turfseer,"[13, 38]","**Warning--This review may contain spoilers**--'An Education' is a film rife with one implausible character after another. For starters, when we're introduced to the protagonist, high school student Jenny, she seems way too sophisticated for a 16 year old. The main problem is that Carey Mulligan, who plays Jenny, is 24 years old in real life. Why didn't they cast a teenager?Then there's the problem of the girl's father, Jack. At first he appears extremely petulant, a caricature of the pushy parent who wants their child to succeed at any cost. With his insistence that Jenny study night and day in order to get into Oxford, we're first led to believe that he's the film's antagonist. But soon when con-artist David appears on the scene, Jack is suddenly reduced to unprincipled buffoon. I say buffoon because he's so easily taken in by David's scheme--that David is actually an Oxford alumni and knows famous Oxford professor/author C.S Lewis. If this was a real character, wouldn't have Jack made a few simple inquiries to determine whether David was telling the truth or not?In very simplistic fashion, the implication here is Jenny's sudden embrace of a life of crime is due to Jack's lack of principles. David basically buys Jack's acquiescence in allowing Jenny's trips away from home and ultimately accepting the idea of Jenny and David tying the knot. Somehow all this so easily rubs off on impressionable Jenny. The gutless father figure is nothing new--just think of Jim Backus strutting around in an apron in 'Rebel without a cause'.Perhaps the moment I found to be the most incredulous was Jenny's sudden transformation from earnest student to unsavory bad girl. Even with the father acting the way he did, would she have so suddenly embraced David once she discovers that he's a con artist? I would think that a normal teenager would have been very alarmed that she was now in the company of a bunch of criminals and fear would have entered into the equation. But what was Jenny's reaction? A mild protest and then David sweeps her off her feet.David was disappointing in that he was such a tame sociopath. What are his crimes? Well, he steals an antique map from a house that's up for sale and arranges for minorities to move into apartment buildings, scaring elderly tenants, and then buying the apartments from them when they decide to leave, at cut-rate prices. Oh yes, he also cheats on his wife. Equally disappointing is the couple he hangs out with--except for one scene where there is a confrontation with Jenny, they really have little to do.Every melodrama needs a villain and that is of course the headmistress of the school Jenny attends. After she finds out David is Jewish, she blurts out that the Jews ""killed our Lord"". Not only is she depicted as a vile anti-Semite but she cruelly rejects Jenny's request to be reinstated. Only Jenny's kindly teacher is willing to give her encouragement.There is nothing subtle about 'An Education'.

Martin ""Darkbard""","[4, 8]","Bottom-Line:  ""An Education,"" is empty, vapid, detached, tedious, and in the end totally pointless.Every once and a while a true talent steps onto the worlds' acting stage, someone who bears watching and indeed is a pleasure to watch no matter what vehicle may showcase their talents. Such is the case with British-born, 24-year old actress Carey Mulligan who took top billing in last years ""An Education (2010),"" also starting Peter Sarsgaard.The StoryDirected by Lone Scherfig (Wilbur, Red Road, Just Like Home), ""An Education"" takes place is London in the early 1960's. Carey Mulligan (Pride & Prejudice, Never Let Me Go, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps) portrays Jenny a sixteen year old girl from a middle-class family striving to get into Oxford University.  She is helped along in this regard by her father Jack (Alfred Molina ~ Spider-Man 2, Silk, Frida), and mother Marjorie (Cara Seymour ~ American Psycho, Gangs of New York, Adaptation).One rainy day after cello practice as she is standing in a downpour waiting for(?), David, portrayed by Peter Saragaard ~ Jarhead, Boys Don't Cry, Flightplan) happens by with a delightful little car and offers Jenny a ride. At first she is reluctant, after all David is roughly twice her age, but eventually she relents, worn down by his considerable charm.  Afterwards, David, with the consent of Jenny's parents starts to show her that there are other things in life other than school and study.David introduces Jenny to his running mates Danny (Dominic Cooper ~ The Duchess, Mamma Mia, The History Boys) and Helen (Roseamund Pike ~ Pride & Prejudice, Die Another Day, Fracture) and together the four start to live the high life and educating Jenny.My Thoughts""An Education"" is a bore! This reviewer hardly knows where to begin complaining about this movie it is largely emotionless, mundane, sexless, and belonged on Lifetime Television, not on the big screen.  And there were considerable problems with the script.  First, what self-respecting parents would let their 16-year old daughter spend afternoons and evenings, let alone weekends away with a grown man twice her age?  Seriously?  In fact everyone in this deflated little tale is made to look like a clown in order to make Jenny, the protagonist appear worldlier than her 16 years would otherwise suggest.And where was the romance in this little farce?  David is charming, and it's easy to understand how a girl of Jenny's naivet&eacute; could fall under his spell, but he is never overly romantic towards Jenny.  There were no stolen kisses, no long, lingering glances, no hand holding, waist hugging, face stroking, no caresses, no poetry laced words.  There is no attempt made to make Jenny fall in love with David, to see him as anything more than a friend introducing her to Jazz and fine art, but suddenly he's asking to see her breasts, and this is before the first kiss; The Graduate (1967), ""An Education"" isn't, the movie lacks the passion, titillation, emotional depth, and drama of that classic coming-of-age story.Yes, David eventually deflowers Jenny, but we are not witness to the event; it happens and the two (alleged) lovers discuss the matter afterward--fully clothed--as if they were discussing what to order from room service!Mulligan, who could be Katie Holmes' younger sister, gives the only (partially) nuanced and emotionally compelling performance in the movie.  And though she is interesting and engaging to watch, even she could not elevation, and or transform, ""An Education"" into something I could recommend with a straight face.  Mulligan is just a momentary distraction (albeit a damn adorable one) from the inconsistencies and incongruities so inherent in the other characters.And as the end plays out Jenny finds evidence that David isn't what he holds himself out to be all too conveniently, and as it turns out stupidly, for David is not beginner at this sort of behavior.  But, Jenny's discovery leads us nowhere; there is no dramatic flourish, no emotional or physical explosion; there is nothing and that is the problem with ""An Education,"" the movie is empty, vapid, detached, tedious, and in the end totally pointless.",2,"A Bore, Despite Mulligan's Fine Performances",1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,4169,"['Bottom-Line', 'Education', 'empty', 'vapid', 'detached', 'tedious', 'end', 'totally', 'pointless.Every', 'once', 'true', 'talent', 'steps', 'worlds', 'acting', 'stage', 'someone', 'who', 'watching', 'indeed', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'matter', 'what', 'vehicle', 'may', 'showcase', 'talents', 'Such', 'case', 'British-born', '24-year', 'old', 'actress', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'who', 'took', 'top', 'billing', 'last', 'years', 'Education', '2010', 'also', 'starting', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard.The', 'StoryDirected', 'Lone', 'Scherfig', 'Wilbur', 'Red', 'Road', 'Just', 'Home', 'Education', 'place', 'London', 'early', '1960', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Money', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'Jenny', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'middle-class', 'family', 'striving', 'get', 'Oxford', 'University', 'helped', 'along', 'regard', 'father', 'Jack', 'Alfred', 'Molina', '~', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'Silk', 'Frida', 'mother', 'Marjorie', 'Cara', 'Seymour', '~', 'American', 'Psycho', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'Adaptation', '.One', 'rainy', 'day', 'cello', 'practice', 'standing', 'downpour', 'waiting', 'David', 'portrayed', 'Peter', 'Saragaard', '~', 'Jarhead', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Flightplan', 'delightful', 'little', 'car', 'Jenny', 'ride', 'first', 'reluctant', 'David', 'roughly', 'twice', 'age', 'eventually', 'worn', 'down', 'considerable', 'charm', 'Afterwards', 'David', 'consent', 'Jenny', 'parents', 'show', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'life', 'other', 'school', 'study.David', 'introduces', 'Jenny', 'running', 'mates', 'Danny', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'Duchess', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'History', 'Boys', 'Helen', 'Roseamund', 'Pike', '~', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Die', 'Day', 'Fracture', 'together', 'four', 'start', 'live', 'high', 'life', 'educating', 'Jenny.My', 'Thoughts', 'Education', 'bore', 'reviewer', 'hardly', 'where', 'begin', 'complaining', 'movie', 'largely', 'emotionless', 'mundane', 'sexless', 'belonged', 'Lifetime', 'Television', 'not', 'big', 'screen', 'were', 'considerable', 'problems', 'script', 'First', 'what', 'self-respecting', 'parents', 'would', 'let', '16-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'spend', 'afternoons', 'evenings', 'let', 'alone', 'weekends', 'away', 'grown', 'man', 'twice', 'age', 'Seriously', 'fact', 'everyone', 'deflated', 'little', 'tale', 'made', 'look', 'clown', 'order', 'make', 'Jenny', 'protagonist', 'worldlier', '16', 'years', 'would', 'otherwise', 'suggest.And', 'where', 'was', 'romance', 'little', 'farce', 'David', 'charming', 'easy', 'understand', 'how', 'girl', 'Jenny', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'could', 'fall', 'spell', 'never', 'overly', 'romantic', 'towards', 'Jenny', 'were', 'stolen', 'kisses', 'long', 'lingering', 'glances', 'hand', 'holding', 'waist', 'hugging', 'face', 'stroking', 'caresses', 'poetry', 'laced', 'words', 'attempt', 'made', 'make', 'Jenny', 'fall', 'love', 'David', 'see', 'anything', 'more', 'friend', 'introducing', 'Jazz', 'fine', 'art', 'suddenly', 'asking', 'see', 'breasts', 'first', 'kiss', 'Graduate', '1967', 'Education', ""n't"", 'movie', 'passion', 'titillation', 'emotional', 'depth', 'drama', 'classic', 'coming-of-age', 'story.Yes', 'David', 'eventually', 'Jenny', 'are', 'not', 'witness', 'event', 'two', 'alleged', 'lovers', 'discuss', 'matter', 'afterward', 'fully', 'clothed', 'were', 'discussing', 'what', 'order', 'room', 'service', 'Mulligan', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'younger', 'sister', 'only', 'partially', 'nuanced', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'performance', 'movie', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'watch', 'even', 'could', 'not', 'elevation', 'transform', 'Education', 'something', 'could', 'recommend', 'straight', 'face', 'Mulligan', 'just', 'momentary', 'distraction', 'damn', 'adorable', 'one', 'inconsistencies', 'incongruities', 'so', 'inherent', 'other', 'characters.And', 'end', 'out', 'Jenny', 'evidence', 'David', ""n't"", 'what', 'be', 'too', 'conveniently', 'out', 'stupidly', 'David', 'not', 'beginner', 'sort', 'behavior', 'Jenny', 'discovery', 'nowhere', 'dramatic', 'flourish', 'emotional', 'physical', 'explosion', 'nothing', 'problem', 'Education', 'movie', 'empty', 'vapid', 'detached', 'tedious', 'end', 'totally', 'pointless']",N/A

1281428,A366K6G0ISLX7Q,B002ONC9NC,vs,"[0, 0]","From a purely cinematographic viewpoint this movie probably deserves only 4 stars: it's very good, but not spectacular as far as the camera work and actors performances are concerned. Still I gave it 5 stars because of the underlying story, based on Lynn Barber memoir of her life in the 1950s.The story is about young girl (Jenny) in her last years of school, preparing for college. She's very smart, self-confident, one of the best students in her class, she plays classical music in the school orchestra, studies Latin and French, and is expected to apply for Oxford.At the same time she lives with her middle-class parents in a quiet but boring London suburb, while real life is going elswehre: some people spend their time going to nice concert halls, traveling to Paris, dining & dancing in beautiful restaurants...All this becomes a possibility for her when she meets David, a man who seems to be able to make all her dreams come true. And - on top of that - he's young enough, around 30, and charming enough, to make him a viable candidate for falling in love with him.The only problem is - the more Jenny knows David, the more he proves to be a crook, making his living off anything from shady real estated dealings up to outright theft.Every time Jenny finds out next detail about dark side of David's life, she's initially appalled, but then she lets herself to be persuaded that there's nothing inherently wrong in whatever David does - as long as he loves her (and, incidentially, spends his money on taking her on nice trips, to expensive restaurants etc).Looks like Jenny would accept anything David does, and finally she agrees to become his wife when he proposes the marriage. But it turns out there's a limit to Jenny's acceptance. At the eve of her wedding she finds out that David is already married. Next day she goes to see his wife and a child - and this becomes too much for her.At the very beginning David tells Jenny that he's a Jew, and there are many scenes in the movie that show various attitudes to the Jews in the British society in the middle of the last century. Some people would certainly find this movie anti-Semitic (see, for instance, ""British Film Gives `An Education' in Anti-Semitism"" by Irina Bragin).In fact, this film can be rather considered anti-British or misogynistic, if one looks at Jenny's moral flexibility in accepting favors from David. It becomes ""too much"" for her only when it comes out that she's one of his victims herself. Also one cannot avoid seeing the way her parents shown in this movie as somewhat satirical, if not outright sarcastic.In general, this is one of the films which become more interesting as time passes, when you have a chance to think of what you saw, to discuss it with friends, because everything in this film has some meaning, not a single scene is wasted, everything is to the point. Takes some time to understand it, and it definitely deserves more than one viewing.",5,"Realistic, frank, unpredictable.",1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,2953,"['purely', 'cinematographic', 'viewpoint', 'movie', 'probably', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'spectacular', 'as', 'far', 'camera', 'work', 'actors', 'performances', 'are', 'concerned', 'Still', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'underlying', 'story', 'based', 'Lynn', 'Barber', 'memoir', 'life', '1950s.The', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'Jenny', 'last', 'years', 'school', 'preparing', 'college', 'very', 'smart', 'self-confident', 'one', 'best', 'students', 'class', 'classical', 'music', 'school', 'orchestra', 'studies', 'Latin', 'French', 'expected', 'apply', 'Oxford.At', 'same', 'time', 'middle-class', 'parents', 'quiet', 'boring', 'London', 'suburb', 'real', 'life', 'going', 'elswehre', 'people', 'spend', 'time', 'going', 'nice', 'concert', 'halls', 'traveling', 'Paris', 'dining', 'dancing', 'beautiful', 'restaurants', 'possibility', 'when', 'David', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'top', 'young', 'enough', '30', 'charming', 'enough', 'make', 'viable', 'candidate', 'falling', 'love', 'him.The', 'only', 'problem', 'more', 'Jenny', 'knows', 'David', 'more', 'be', 'crook', 'making', 'living', 'off', 'anything', 'shady', 'real', 'estated', 'dealings', 'outright', 'theft.Every', 'time', 'Jenny', 'out', 'next', 'detail', 'dark', 'side', 'David', 'life', 'initially', 'appalled', 'then', 'be', 'persuaded', 'nothing', 'inherently', 'wrong', 'David', 'as', 'long', 'incidentially', 'money', 'taking', 'nice', 'trips', 'expensive', 'restaurants', 'etc', '.Looks', 'Jenny', 'would', 'accept', 'anything', 'David', 'finally', 'become', 'wife', 'when', 'marriage', 'out', 'limit', 'Jenny', 'acceptance', 'eve', 'wedding', 'out', 'David', 'already', 'married', 'Next', 'day', 'see', 'wife', 'child', 'too', 'much', 'her.At', 'very', 'beginning', 'David', 'tells', 'Jenny', 'Jew', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'show', 'various', 'attitudes', 'Jews', 'British', 'society', 'middle', 'last', 'century', 'people', 'would', 'certainly', 'find', 'movie', 'anti-Semitic', 'see', 'instance', 'British', 'Film', 'Gives', 'Education', 'Anti-Semitism', 'Irina', 'Bragin', '.In', 'fact', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'considered', 'anti-British', 'misogynistic', 'one', 'Jenny', 'moral', 'flexibility', 'accepting', 'favors', 'David', 'too', 'much', 'only', 'when', 'out', 'one', 'victims', 'Also', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'avoid', 'seeing', 'way', 'parents', 'shown', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'satirical', 'not', 'outright', 'sarcastic.In', 'general', 'one', 'films', 'become', 'more', 'interesting', 'time', 'passes', 'when', 'have', 'chance', 'think', 'what', 'saw', 'discuss', 'friends', 'everything', 'film', 'meaning', 'not', 'single', 'scene', 'wasted', 'everything', 'point', 'Takes', 'time', 'understand', 'definitely', 'more', 'one', 'viewing']",N/A

1281430,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B002ONC9NC,Westley,"[1, 1]","Jenny (Carey Mulligan) is a 16-year-old promising schoolgirl in London in 1961.  She plays the cello and joins all the right activities, and her pushy parents want her to attend Oxford.  She works hard and knows that going to university will likely lead to a teaching career; her life will be much like the one lead by her supportive but bland teacher, Miss Stubbs (Olivia Williams).  However, one rainy day at a bus stop, she meets the dynamic, charming 30-something David (Peter Sarsgaard).  Normally, a girl of her type would shy away from a forward older man, but for some reason, Jenny doesn't.  She ends up dating David and being sucked into his world, which involves exciting trips to Paris, suppers at chic jazz clubs, and parties with David's rich friends.  Is Peter ""educating"" Jenny about how exciting life can be, or will Jenny's education involve something else, perhaps something less pleasant?""An Education"" is a well-acted period piece.  Carey Mulligan has received numerous nominations (including for an Academy Award) for her turn as Jenny.  The 24-year-old actress does a beautiful job with her difficult role, which begins as a wide-eyed 16-year-old and ends somewhere else entirely.  Peter Sarsgaard is also quite good; he keeps his character's intentions murky enough so that we never know whether to trust him.  The look of the film is quite nice, and I particularly enjoyed how it captured the early 1960s jazz scene.  I'm sure that many viewers will wish that they could be in Jenny's place.  Surprisingly, the Danish director (Lone Scherfig) is an adherent to Dogme95, although I don't see any trace of that aesthetic in this film, her first in English.  The script, by write Nick Hornby is based on an autobiographical article by journalist Lynn Barber; I generally like Hornby's work, and at times ""An Education"" is quite funny.  Hornsby received his first Oscar nomination for the script (the film based on his novel ""About a Boy"" was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, but Hornby did not write that script).Despite the film's strengths, it ended up falling a bit flat for me.  First, I never bought into the reaction of her Jenny's parents to David - they're more easily seduced than is Jenny!  Second, it was difficult to understand how Jenny herself could so quickly turn against the academics that were previously the center of her world.  The transformation from dreamy schoolgirl to partying clubgoer was a bit too abrupt and the audience could have benefitted from hearing Jenny's thoughts on the matter.  Finally, the main story (young woman used by an older man) is a familiar one, and I don't think ""An Education"" added much new to the genre.

Wonderful story, excellent acting (unexpected performance from Peter Saarsgard), surprise appearance from Emma Thompson in a supporting role (I am guilty of adoring her - she can do no wrong in my book, even in Harry Potter.)I typically love English coming of age stories and this is why, they do not disappoint. What a treat - great story telling infused with the credibility of fine acting and accesorized with vistas from the English countryside and Paris.The lead actress is a better version of Katie Holmes at her age, I think she is headed for great things. She has truly mastered the ability to both play an intellectually superior and tenderly cocky adolescent - most often with facial expression- but equally be a fragile child in the presence of Peter's character. Ah-ha and I just looked her up after writing that, she was nominated for a Golden Globe for this role. :)This is an enjoyable film for anyone with an interest in the topic.",4,A Wonderful Education!,1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,956,"['Superb', 'Wonderful', 'story', 'excellent', 'acting', 'unexpected', 'performance', 'Peter', 'Saarsgard', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'supporting', 'role', 'am', 'guilty', 'adoring', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'book', 'even', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'typically', 'love', 'English', 'coming', 'age', 'stories', 'why', 'do', 'not', 'disappoint', 'What', 'treat', 'great', 'story', 'telling', 'infused', 'credibility', 'fine', 'acting', 'accesorized', 'vistas', 'English', 'countryside', 'Paris.The', 'lead', 'actress', 'better', 'version', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'age', 'think', 'headed', 'great', 'things', 'truly', 'mastered', 'ability', 'play', 'intellectually', 'superior', 'tenderly', 'cocky', 'adolescent', 'most', 'often', 'facial', 'expression-', 'equally', 'be', 'fragile', 'child', 'presence', 'Peter', 'character', 'Ah-ha', 'just', 'looked', 'up', 'writing', 'was', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'role', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'anyone', 'interest', 'topic']",N/A
1281432,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002ONC9NC,Z Hayes,"[4, 5]","Set in 60s London, ""An Education"" centers on 16-year-old Jenny (Carey Mulligan delivering a finely-nuanced performance) who is preparing for her 'A' Levels for entrance into Oxford University. Jenny plays the cello, has a keen eye for art, and wants to read English at Oxford. Her father Jack (credibly portrayed by Alfred Molina) wishes to see his only child in a prestigious university as a means of elevating their status as a family. A rainy day changes everything as Jenny's path crosses that of a smooth-talking older man, David (Peter Skarsgaard who delivers a compelling performance despite a rather weak English accent). David entices Jenny to take a ride in his coveted Bristol and Jenny finds herself slowly but surely falling for Peter and his sophisticated ways. The pair dine out in fancy restaurants, listen to jazz music in cool clubs, and live the high life together with Peter's friends, Danny (Dominic Cooper, who has also appeared in movies such asMamma Mia! The Movie (Widescreen)and as James Willoughby inSense & Sensibility (with Miss Austen Regrets) (BBC TV 2008)and Danny's girlfriend Helen (Rosamund Pike, who has also appeared in a BBC period drama,Wives and Daughters. Suddenly, the previously sheltered Jenny finds herself being swept off her feet and introduced to a sophisticated, fun new world she had only dreamed of in the past.Inevitably, the once studious and hardworking Jenny begins to falter as her studies take a backseat to nights out, weekends off in the country, and even a trip to Paris. Her parents fall for David's charm and the social climbing Jack goes as far as to determine that Jenny might as well give up Oxford if she manages to get David to marry her. No one really has a clue as to how David manages to finance his high-flying lifestyle, though Jenny does find out sometime in the movie and begins to see a darker side to David and his life. There are more revelations to come before the movie ends, and the question is: Will Jenny be able to realize her potential? Will her informal ""education"" procured during her time with David be sufficient for her or is there still a place for formal schooling in her life?I thought the film was beautifully made - the scenic setting, the 60s lifestyle and the myriad themes explored all blend together convincingly to create a truly poignant coming-of-age tale. Carey Mulligan (who first impressed me in a secondary role inMasterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbeydelivers both a delightful and heartbreaking performance as the confident yet ultimately vulnerable young child-woman. The chemistry between Mulligan's Jenny and Skarsgaard's David is credible and powerful - one can see that there's a certain neediness in David that is assuaged by being with the young Jenny, and Jenny in turn is intoxicated by the power she wields over David. The rather sensitive issue of sex between a 17-year-old and a much older man is subtly addressed and there are no exploitative or gratuitous scenes to offend anyone's sensibilities (though it probably merits mentioning that the age of consent in Britain is 16).Final verdict - a fine coming-of-age tale set in a time when the sexual revolution and feminism were about to take serious flight.",5,Coming of age in 60s London,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,3226,"['Set', '60s', 'London', 'Education', 'centers', '16-year-old', 'Jenny', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'delivering', 'finely-nuanced', 'performance', 'who', 'preparing', 'A', 'Levels', 'entrance', 'Oxford', 'University', 'Jenny', 'cello', 'keen', 'eye', 'art', 'read', 'English', 'Oxford', 'father', 'Jack', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'see', 'only', 'child', 'prestigious', 'university', 'means', 'elevating', 'status', 'family', 'rainy', 'day', 'changes', 'everything', 'Jenny', 'path', 'smooth-talking', 'older', 'man', 'David', 'Peter', 'Skarsgaard', 'who', 'compelling', 'performance', 'rather', 'weak', 'English', 'accent', 'David', 'Jenny', 'take', 'ride', 'coveted', 'Bristol', 'Jenny', 'slowly', 'surely', 'falling', 'Peter', 'sophisticated', 'ways', 'pair', 'out', 'fancy', 'restaurants', 'listen', 'jazz', 'music', 'cool', 'clubs', 'live', 'high', 'life', 'together', 'Peter', 'friends', 'Danny', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'movies', 'such', 'asMamma', 'Mia', 'Movie', 'Widescreen', 'James', 'Willoughby', 'inSense', 'Sensibility', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'Regrets', 'BBC', 'TV', '2008', 'Danny', 'girlfriend', 'Helen', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'BBC', 'period', 'drama', 'Wives', 'Daughters', 'Suddenly', 'previously', 'sheltered', 'Jenny', 'being', 'swept', 'off', 'feet', 'introduced', 'sophisticated', 'fun', 'new', 'world', 'had', 'only', 'dreamed', 'past.Inevitably', 'once', 'studious', 'hardworking', 'Jenny', 'falter', 'studies', 'take', 'backseat', 'nights', 'out', 'country', 'even', 'trip', 'Paris', 'parents', 'fall', 'David', 'charm', 'social', 'climbing', 'Jack', 'as', 'far', 'determine', 'Jenny', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'up', 'Oxford', 'get', 'David', 'marry', 'one', 'really', 'clue', 'how', 'David', 'finance', 'high-flying', 'lifestyle', 'Jenny', 'find', 'out', 'sometime', 'movie', 'see', 'darker', 'side', 'David', 'life', 'are', 'more', 'revelations', 'come', 'movie', 'question', 'Will', 'Jenny', 'be', 'able', 'realize', 'potential', 'Will', 'informal', 'education', 'procured', 'time', 'David', 'be', 'sufficient', 'still', 'place', 'formal', 'schooling', 'life', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'beautifully', 'made', 'scenic', 'setting', '60s', 'lifestyle', 'myriad', 'themes', 'explored', 'blend', 'together', 'convincingly', 'create', 'truly', 'poignant', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'who', 'first', 'impressed', 'secondary', 'role', 'inMasterpiece', 'Theatre', 'Northanger', 'Abbeydelivers', 'delightful', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'confident', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'vulnerable', 'young', 'child-woman', 'chemistry', 'Mulligan', 'Jenny', 'Skarsgaard', 'David', 'credible', 'powerful', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'certain', 'neediness', 'David', 'assuaged', 'being', 'young', 'Jenny', 'Jenny', 'turn', 'intoxicated', 'power', 'David', 'rather', 'sensitive', 'issue', 'sex', '17-year-old', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'subtly', 'addressed', 'are', 'exploitative', 'gratuitous', 'scenes', 'offend', 'anyone', 'sensibilities', 'probably', 'mentioning', 'age', 'consent', 'Britain', '16', '.Final', 'verdict', 'fine', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'set', 'time', 'when', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'feminism', 'were', 'take', 'serious', 'flight']",N/A
