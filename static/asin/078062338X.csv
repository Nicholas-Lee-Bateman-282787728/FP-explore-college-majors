The raw realism of assassin Booth and the near poetic verbal gems of Lincoln are captivating to see and hear. Lance Hendrickson is a great Lincoln. Empathy and passion are constantly drawn out from the charactors on a theatrical level that is not the norm for tv fare. The movie has an ominous aura thats unlike any film I've ever seen on Lincoln.

Any history fan will love this one. My only complaint is that it is based on a book,Blood On The Moon, an interesting book, filled with suppositions, guesses and conclusions. Too many. Not that they aren't reasonable conclusions, but too many. The acting and period scenery makes this one interesting from beginning to end. I believe it is always hardest to do period pieces because one's natural accent or mannerisms may inadvertently rise to the top. Rob Morrow did not have such a problem. He was excellent as the lead  in this one.One might only feel an ounce of sympathy or understanding for one of history's villains when acted to perfection today , instead of being judged by the written word.  I wish there was more time in this movie to explore the days between Lincoln's assassination and the death of Booth, as far as Booth's life on the run is concerned. We saw that the man who murdered one of history's linchpins also loved  a girl passionately, his bawling when thinking about his mother, shortly before his death, his view that killing the president was an act of war as opposed to murdering one of America's greatest protagonists.Herickson was great as Lincoln. Stoic,compassionate, realistic, never boring all describe Herickson's performance portraying a man who was never going to enter a room singing ""Beat It"".

But I digress.This made-for-TV movie is quite good, considering that now, every idiot in the media wants to portray the Christian presidents as secularists.

Few of them really looked like the historical persona. Lincoln's portrayal was a letdown from the start. Although he looked fairly close, his voice was all wrong. Lincoln had a squeaky voice with a real Kentucky twang. (This comes from observations by Lincoln's law partner, Herndon as well as Nicolaye &amp; Haye, Lincoln's secretaries and biographers) Hal Holbrook actually came closest to the right pitch and tone. Even more annoying was the portrayal of Sec. of War Edward Stanton. Here, he comes across like a frustrated grandfather. The real Stanton was NOT a Lincoln fan, he once refered to Lincoln as the &quot;original baboon&quot; and constantly challenged the 16th president on issue after issue. Lincoln would let Stanton have his temper tantrums, but managed to &quot;put his foot down&quot; at the right time. Stanton himself was far from well liked by other members of the cabinet and was actually feared and loathed by many. First Lady Mary Todd was far too slender and attractive in this depiction. If you've ever seen photos of the real Mary, she looked dowdy if not downright frumpy. Her rages were legendary in Washington. She once chased a deliveryman down the street with a broomstick. Secretary Seward called her a &quot;she-wolf&quot; and others dubbed her a bit**. A surprise for me was the portrayal of Dr. Charles A. Leale, the 27 year old Army surgeon who took charge of Lincoln after the shooting. The actor bore more than striking resemblance. It was almost spooky to watch. Jim Bishop's book was followed closely which was one of the more appealing parts of this film.

32973,AHO60TMP4EZQN,078062338X,William Nash,"[3, 3]","The Day Lincoln Was Shot is a book by Jim Bishop that I've always loved. In fact, I not only have the book itself in hardback, but I also have it in audiobook form. I probably listen to it once a year or so and am always delighted with it. Now the DVD of the book is available! I don't know why I missed the original broadcast of the film on TNT back in 1998. Admittedly, I don't watch much TV, but I would have made an exception for this movie! So in 2011, I purchased the DVD of the film that was released in 1998-oh well-better late than never.I wasn't disappointed. This movie is very well done. It stars Lance Henriksen as Lincoln and Rob Morrow as Booth. Both do outstanding jobs in their roles. Henriksen obviously studied Lincoln. He moves and acts like I imagine Lincoln would move and act. He looks very much like Lincoln, as well. Only his voice is off. Henrikson's voice is much deeper than the accounts of Lincoln's high pitched Kentucky twang was said to be. Henriksen nails Lincoln's humor, patience, and quiet sturdiness. As for Morrow as Booth-he is also outstanding. I see Booth when I see Morrow playing Booth. He captures the various facets of the assassin-the gentleman, the playboy, the man absolutely devoted to the cause as he sees it. The other cast members are done fairly well, but Henriksen and Morrow make the movie.The film is 94 minutes. The color is beautiful. The period sets are great. The music is dramatic and really adds to the build-up of the Ford's theater shooting. Throughout the movie,one really gets the feel of 1865 Washington. The costumes are dead on-including the soldiers. The soldiers don't look like re-enactors (like I think they do in Gettysburg). Sure, there are some problems with the historical record-but for me- they're minor and not worth mentioning here. I recommend this film to Lincoln buffs as well as to those who may not be familiar with the history.

32974,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,078062338X,Wuchak,"[3, 3]","""The Day Lincoln was Shot"" is a 1998 TV film. You wouldn't expect much in light of this, but you'd be wrong.All I expect in a historical film like this is reasonable historical accuracy and the ability to take me back in time to envision what it was really like (to some acceptable degree, that is). ""The Day Lincoln was Shot"" delivers in spades.Rob Morrow is outstanding as actor/murderer John Wilkes Booth. I've read loads of history but Booth never came alive to me until I saw this movie the other day. Booth was a passionate, charismatic, creative type, which obviously explains his occupation. This and his love for the Confederacy proved to be an explosive combination. The film shows Booth practicing his murder in front of a mirror, trying to get the Latin for ""Death to tyrants"" just right. You just know this nut really did this to psyche himself up for the murder.FYI: After assassinating Lincoln, Booth caught the spur of his boot on the flag drape as he jumped down from Lincoln's box at Ford's Theater and consequently broke the leg he awkwardly landed on.Lance Henriksen is fine as Lincon and Donna Murphy is great as his wife Mary. Some say Donna is too good-looking to play Mrs. Lincoln, but Mary Todd wasn't all THAT bad-looking if you check out pictures of her; and she certainly wasn't fat. Besides Donna's beauty is played way down here. Anyway, the film well display's Mary Todd's catty, jealous, tempermental nature. Despite this reality, ol' Abe and Mary LOVED each other and the picture properly shows it.Ever wonder what family time was like in the White House back then? What were the Lincoln's like at dinner time? Did Abe play with his youngest son? Etc. This picture shows you these things. Interestingly, Will Wheaton, the notorious Wusley Crusher from Star Trek: The Next Generation, plays Lincoln's oldest living son Robert Todd. He does a fine job too. I didn't even recognise him (thank God).I especially enjoyed the scene where Abe & Mary go for a ride in the country on a carriage surrounded by numerous security guards on horseback. My wife & I often go on rides in the country and it was just interesting to observe Abe & Mary doing the same thing. Why wouldn't they? This is a great scene.The locations are completely convincing and the film is lensed with such expertise that the viewer is successfully ushered back to the time of the story. The cinematography has that dark, realistic look of modern films like, say, ""Last of the Mohicans"" as opposed to the overly-lighted, artificial look of older films. The score is great as well.One powerful scene shows Lincoln talking with his militarists and advisors after the surrender of Lee's army. The latter insist upon the immediate imprisonment and execution of Jefferson Davis, Lee and other significant leaders of the rebellion. Lincoln hears them out but ultimately responds (I'm paraphrasing): ""No. Haven't we seen enough bloodshed, enough death? I am adamant about this!"" This is line with Lincoln's second inaugural address wherein he stated:""With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan -- to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.""This shows Lincoln's character and partially explains why he is one of my personal heroes. He wanted the hostilities and death to end in America; he wanted forgiveness, reconciliation, goodwill and healing to prevail.Booth felt that, by killing Lincoln, he'd be helping the cause of the South. He wrongly expected his mad scheme to throw the Union into chaos and embolden the Southerners to continue fighting, regardless of the fact that they had already surrendered. Ironically his murderous scheme was the worst thing he could have done for his Southern comrades. Lincoln would have ensured mercy and leniency during Reconstruction, at least to some reasonable extent, but Booth's actions needlessly brought on many hard years to come for the South, much harder than they would have been otherwise anyway.Unfortunately ""The Day Lincoln was Shot"" is currently only available on VHS. The good thing is that it's presently offered at Amazon for a very cheap price. If you're into well-made historical films I'd scarf it up.For comparisons, ""The Day Lincoln was Shot"" blows away boring, bloated historical films like the overrated ""Gettysburg."" It's on a par with ""Pharoah's Army"" albeit not quite as good as ""Glory.""For a good well-rounded cinematic look at the Civil War period I recommend these films: ""Glory,"" ""Pharoah's Army,"" ""Ride with the Devil,"" ""Gods and Generals,"" ""The Horse Soldiers,"" ""The Blue and the Gray,"" ""Cold Mountain"" and, of course, ""The Day Lincoln was Shot."" ""Andersonville"" is worth seeing too as long as you keep in mind that it's a one-dimensional prison picture (dealing with the most infamous prison camp of the Civil War) (by ""one-dimensional"" I mean that the story takes place almost entirely within a prison stockade in Georgia).",5,Want to See History Come Alive?
