6979,A14N5L5T089VX3,0767802683,"Allen Vander Meulen ""Omnivorous reader""","[1, 1]","I enjoy Julia Roberts films - such asRunaway Bride.  This film is not the most challenging or original role she's ever played, but it is well-acted, beautifully photographed and wickedly funny.I must admit that I am not a big fan of films where people make fools of themselves: I tend to squirm in my seat, hide my eyes and groan when confronted with scenes where this happens.  I did lots of that in this film as Ms. Roberts' character, Food Critic Julianne Potter, tries to derail the planned wedding of her best friend Michael (who is played by Dermot Mulroney).  Each attempt only gets her into a deeper quagmire, she finally calls on her editor and close friend George (Rupert Everett) who sees right through her, and so loyally, thoughtfully and sometimes gleefully assists her descent into the comedic morass she has made for herself.  Cameron Diaz as Kimberly, the Bride to be, also gives us a taste of the comedic and dramatic talent that has made her such a success since this film was made.Aside from Mr. Mulroney's performance, which seemed a bit wooden, this film provides us with top notch performances from all of it's main actors.  There are also a slew of familiar faces who did great work in supporting roles, such as M. Emmet Walsh as the father of the groom; Philip Bosco as father of the Bride and a young Chris Masterson as the bride's younger brother.  Most of the exterior scenes were shot in Chicago.  It was enjoyable, as a former resident of the region, to see many of my favorite spots in the city on screen.While some of the situations engineered by Julianne to win back Michael seemed a bit far fetched, overall, the film's intent is to give us an enjoyable ""chick flick"" with a good hearted ending, and it succeeds.  I give this film kudos for not playing games with the audience, for the excellent technical work, and solid performances.  Even though my own personal tastes mean I'll probably avoid this film in the future, I did have some good laughs while watching it.  For most, I see ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" as a good film to watch some evening with your ""best friend"" on TV, via Amazon's ""Unbox"" Service (you can use this link:My Best Friend's Wedding), or buy the DVD.

6981,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767802683,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Sharp-witted and genuinely engaging, `My Best Friend's Wedding' is a surefire hit for anyone interested in a crowd pleasing romantic comedy.  It has a few missteps, that's a give in, but the charming performances and blissful ending (not one you might expect) make up for the few errors in judgment.The film tells the story of Julianne Potter, a successful woman approaching thirty who is afraid of falling in love.  Truth be told, she is in love, with Michael O'Neal, her best friend of over nine years.  The two had once been together but quickly fell apart only to realize that they were too close to be lovers.  When Michael calls to inform Julianne he is engaged she is suddenly thrown into panic mode as she realizes that she needs to be with Michael.  She flies off for the wedding with one plan in mind; to break up the happy couple.  She never expected Kim, Michael's fianc&eacute;e, to be as sweet and perfect as she was, but her perfection was only more fuel to the fire.Julianne does everything in her power to ruin the relationship between Michael and Kim, but everything she does only seems to bring them closer together.  Her closest friend George comes to her aid, but even his help makes little impact.  It isn't until Julianne goes too far that she realizes if she truly loves this man, she just may need to let him go.The performances are all top notch, especially from Roberts, Diaz and Everett.  Julia is always a delight, and her catty humor here is brilliantly sarcastic and genuine to say the least.  The one fault I found with this film (aside from the corny opening sequences) is that the character of Julianne is almost so evil you forget that you are supposed to like her.  Julia does her best to make this character relatable and likable, but the script doesn't help her out too much and we wind up hating her in parts.  Sure, she turns around in the end and earns our love, but getting there can be rough.  Diaz and Everett have our unwavering love and devotion throughout the entire film though, each of them delivering spunky, funny and honest performances.  Diaz is a comedic gem who devours her `ditzy girl' character with warmth and Everett takes his `sidekick' character to another level with scene stealing wit and comedic timing (the whole `singing in the restaurant' and the last dance scene are prime examples of his brilliance).I'm really not a fan of Mulroney.  He's serviceable, but that's about it.  He was really the other misstep.  I just didn't find him interesting enough to be the object of these two women's affections.  Both women, in their own ways, are real catches.  Julianne is confident and successful and devoted, and Kim is beautiful and spontaneous and vibrant.  Michael was kind of a dud.  It's a good thing the film is less interested in him and more interested in the other characters.I will say, I really enjoyed this movie.  Sure, I hated Julianne in parts, but maybe that was the point (I don't think it was, but the minor misstep is forgivable in the end).  The script is really funny, and that makes up for a lot (""I could be jello"").  I recommend this movie to any fan of the genre or the star, for Roberts is at the top of her game.",4,A slew of great performances elevate this comedic hit...,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,3201,"['Sharp-witted', 'genuinely', 'engaging', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'surefire', 'hit', 'anyone', 'interested', 'crowd', 'pleasing', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'few', 'missteps', 'give', 'charming', 'performances', 'blissful', 'ending', 'not', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'make', 'up', 'few', 'errors', 'judgment.The', 'film', 'story', 'Julianne', 'Potter', 'successful', 'woman', 'approaching', 'thirty', 'who', 'afraid', 'falling', 'love', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'love', 'Michael', ""O'Neal"", 'best', 'friend', 'nine', 'years', 'two', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'together', 'quickly', 'fell', 'apart', 'only', 'realize', 'were', 'too', 'close', 'be', 'lovers', 'When', 'Michael', 'inform', 'Julianne', 'engaged', 'suddenly', 'thrown', 'panic', 'mode', 'be', 'Michael', 'wedding', 'one', 'plan', 'mind', 'break', 'up', 'happy', 'couple', 'never', 'expected', 'Kim', 'Michael', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'be', 'sweet', 'perfect', 'was', 'perfection', 'was', 'only', 'more', 'fuel', 'fire.Julianne', 'everything', 'power', 'ruin', 'relationship', 'Michael', 'Kim', 'everything', 'only', 'bring', 'closer', 'together', 'closest', 'friend', 'George', 'aid', 'even', 'help', 'little', 'impact', ""n't"", 'Julianne', 'too', 'far', 'loves', 'man', 'just', 'may', 'need', 'let', 'go.The', 'performances', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'especially', 'Roberts', 'Diaz', 'Everett', 'Julia', 'always', 'delight', 'catty', 'humor', 'here', 'brilliantly', 'sarcastic', 'genuine', 'say', 'least', 'one', 'fault', 'found', 'film', 'aside', 'corny', 'opening', 'sequences', 'character', 'Julianne', 'almost', 'so', 'evil', 'forget', 'are', 'supposed', 'Julia', 'best', 'make', 'character', 'relatable', 'likable', 'script', ""n't"", 'help', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'wind', 'up', 'hating', 'parts', 'Sure', 'around', 'end', 'love', 'getting', 'can', 'be', 'rough', 'Diaz', 'Everett', 'have', 'unwavering', 'love', 'devotion', 'entire', 'film', 'delivering', 'spunky', 'funny', 'honest', 'performances', 'Diaz', 'comedic', 'gem', 'who', 'ditzy', 'girl', 'character', 'warmth', 'Everett', 'sidekick', 'character', 'level', 'scene', 'stealing', 'wit', 'comedic', 'timing', 'whole', 'singing', 'restaurant', 'last', 'dance', 'scene', 'are', 'prime', 'examples', 'brilliance', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'fan', 'Mulroney', 'serviceable', 'was', 'really', 'other', 'misstep', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'interesting', 'enough', 'be', 'object', 'two', 'women', 'affections', 'women', 'own', 'ways', 'are', 'real', 'catches', 'Julianne', 'confident', 'successful', 'devoted', 'Kim', 'beautiful', 'spontaneous', 'vibrant', 'Michael', 'was', 'kind', 'dud', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'less', 'interested', 'more', 'interested', 'other', 'characters.I', 'will', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Sure', 'hated', 'Julianne', 'parts', 'maybe', 'was', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'minor', 'misstep', 'forgivable', 'end', 'script', 'really', 'funny', 'up', 'lot', 'could', 'be', 'jello', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fan', 'genre', 'star', 'Roberts', 'top', 'game']",N/A
6982,A1SZQPOYC7SSDG,0767802683,Annie,"[3, 4]","When I read the reviews of this movie, all the critics said that this movie worth the great STURGES's, CUKOR's or LUBITSCH's classics. It is certainly not. The plot is common, the dialogues often poor, and I didn't understand why Julia's character wants Mulroney's one so much (Mulroney is totally uninteresting). The only good scenes are when the excellent Rupert EVERETT appears (and I think the actor gave a lot of himself in his 3 scenes). I found Julia ROBERTS exaspirating in some scenes (she thinks that she only had to speak loud, fall several times from her chair or smoking a lot of cigarettes to be considered as the new Katharine Hepburn or the new Carole LOMBARD - the genial and zany stars of &quot;Bringing up baby&quot; and &quot;My man Godfrey&quot;). I know it is my OWN point of view, but I don't think Julia ROBERTS (and Meg RYAN and Sandra BULLOCK...) is a good screwball actress (in the Colbert/Lombard/Hepburn/Dunne way). When she tries to be like those stars of the Golden age of American comedies, she is totally artificial an &quot;forces&quot; her effects (big mouth...) -just see overrated romentic comedies like &quot;Notting Hill&quot;, &quot;The runaway bride&quot;, &quot;The mexican&quot;, etc, and compare them to a Preston STURGES's classic- On the other hand, in a &quot;serious&quot; movie like &quot;ERIN BROCKOVITCH&quot;, she is totally just and sensitive, and she deserves her reputation. To go back to &quot;My best friend...&quot;, it is worth watching for the Rupert EVERETT's scenes. I feel the director P.J.

This is an ultimately disappointing film despite good performances from all of the leads.  The premise is simple, Jules and Mike have a passionate affair in their college days, this then becomes 'best friendship' in no small part due to Jules commitment phobia. One day Jules gets a call from Mike to say that he is getting married in four days and inviting her to the wedding.

6987,A7NBCYVPM10U7,0767802683,Bill Jones,"[3, 4]","The Australian director P.J. Hogan (&quot;Muriel's Wedding&quot;) has gone Hollywood and the results are slightly disappointing, but you may want to catch &quot;My Best Friend's Wedding&quot; on video.Julia Roberts stars as Julianne (her nickname's &quot;Jules&quot; which may be a reference to  Truffaut's &quot;Jules and Jim&quot; - the classic romantic triangle  movie).  She's a single food critic, who, as the film opens, gets a call  from an old boyfriend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney) - he's getting married in  four days to Kim (Cameron Diaz).  Suddenly, Jules realizes she actually  loves Michael and sets her sights on breaking up the wedding.  &quot;She's  toast,&quot; she tells her gay editor (well played by Rupert Everett).  Michael wants her at the wedding (for support) and Kim actually asks her to  be her maid of honor - little does she know.&quot;My Best Friend's  Wedding&quot; is in the romantic comedy tradition.  It doesn't go for big  laughs and I was surprised at how unlikable Julia Roberts character was  (physical clues: she hides behind dark sunglasses and smokes).  Of all the  relationships in the film I actually liked the one between Roberts and  Rupert Everett best.  They're perfect for each other (except he's gay).  And he gives the best advice - except she doesn't listen.  You may find (as  I did) that you really despise the stunts Roberts pulls.  If you stick with  it, though, there's a nice payoff at the end.  And it helps if you keep in  mind that love is insane.(It doesn't quite make 3 stars, but I'd have  selected 2 1/2 if that were an option.)",2,The insanity of love,956361600,"04 22, 2000",2000,1591,"['Australian', 'director', 'P.J', 'Hogan', 'quot', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', 'quot', 'gone', 'Hollywood', 'results', 'are', 'slightly', 'disappointing', 'may', 'want', 'catch', 'quot', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'quot', 'video.Julia', 'Roberts', 'stars', 'Julianne', 'nickname', 'quot', 'Jules', 'quot', 'may', 'be', 'reference', 'Truffaut', 'quot', 'Jules', 'Jim', 'quot', 'classic', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'movie', 'single', 'food', 'critic', 'who', 'film', 'call', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'Michael', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'getting', 'married', 'four', 'days', 'Kim', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Suddenly', 'Jules', 'actually', 'Michael', 'sights', 'breaking', 'up', 'wedding', 'quot', 'toast', 'quot', 'gay', 'editor', 'well', 'played', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'Michael', 'wedding', 'support', 'Kim', 'actually', 'be', 'maid', 'honor', 'little', 'know.', 'quot', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'quot', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'tradition', ""n't"", 'go', 'big', 'laughs', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'unlikable', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'character', 'was', 'physical', 'clues', 'dark', 'sunglasses', 'smokes', 'relationships', 'film', 'actually', 'liked', 'one', 'Roberts', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'best', ""'re"", 'perfect', 'other', 'gay', 'best', 'advice', ""n't"", 'listen', 'may', 'find', 'did', 'really', 'despise', 'stunts', 'Roberts', 'pulls', 'stick', 'though', 'nice', 'payoff', 'end', 'keep', 'mind', 'love', 'insane', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', '3', 'stars', ""'d"", 'have', 'selected', '2', '1/2', 'were', 'option']",N/A
6988,A1YB29BIDULEYE,0767802683,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 1]","While this is not your typical romance, it is in fact the differences that make this a true masterpiece. The movie starts with Roberts having a meal with her good friend and editor George. (George happens to be gay.) It is interesting that George is not ashamed of being gay, but he doesn't scream it from the rooftops either. He is to be the voice of reason in this comedy of mishaps.Roberts is happy to get a call from her former romantic partner Michael. But this soon turns to panic when she realizes that he is marrying Kimmy. (Roberts is getting an invitation to the wedding.) George tries to calm roberts down, but to no avail. She is determined to break the wedding. Whether we are routing for Roberts or find her actions cruel, somehow we get the impression that she is fighting a doomed uphill battle.We meet Kimmy, and we have no reason to doubt that they are a proper match. To be sure, there is one weak point that Roberts finds and exploits, but let's be fair. What relationship doesn't have some weak point?Roberts realizes that her plans have backfired, and she desperately calls George for help. George tries to be a friend to Roberts, but his patience wears down when he sees her new plan. (Pretending she is engaged to George to make Michael jealous.) While George plays along, it is clear that he has had it with this whole thing. He nails the crux of the matter when he says: ""Do you really love him, or this just about winning?""Roberts then starts to lie about George. Her determination to win this lost cause has caused her to lie about the one man who really cares about her. It is interesting that when we see Michael and Roberts together, we can infer their relationship had serious flaws. There is usually (if not always) a visible tension. In a final desperate attempt to stop the wedding, Roberts does something that is not only deceptive and cruel, but flat out illegal. (Fraud to say the least.)Only then does her conscience start to wake up. But even though she is learning that there is more to life than our own passions and desires, she still fights to win this man who doesn't love her. (This is underlined in a comical, but tragic car chase.)Only after Roberts realizes her cruelty as well as her absurd actions does she realize that if someone doesn't love you, you can't make them.This movie is a masterpiece complete with a great story, superb acting, and a harmonious mixture of comedy and tragedy. But even more than that, it underlines that TRIUMPH comes NOT always from getting what we want, but reaching the point where we can see beyond our passions and desires to do what is right.While there is a certain sadness in the restoration of order, we also know it is right. But joy reenters when George proves himself to be a real friend, and is there for her.",5,More To Life Than Ourselves,1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,2802,"['not', 'typical', 'romance', 'fact', 'differences', 'make', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'movie', 'Roberts', 'having', 'meal', 'good', 'friend', 'editor', 'George', 'George', 'be', 'gay', 'interesting', 'George', 'not', 'ashamed', 'being', 'gay', ""n't"", 'scream', 'rooftops', 'either', 'be', 'voice', 'reason', 'comedy', 'mishaps.Roberts', 'happy', 'get', 'call', 'former', 'romantic', 'partner', 'Michael', 'soon', 'panic', 'when', 'marrying', 'Kimmy', 'Roberts', 'getting', 'invitation', 'wedding', 'George', 'calm', 'roberts', 'down', 'avail', 'determined', 'break', 'wedding', 'are', 'routing', 'Roberts', 'find', 'actions', 'cruel', 'somehow', 'get', 'impression', 'fighting', 'doomed', 'uphill', 'battle.We', 'meet', 'Kimmy', 'have', 'reason', 'doubt', 'are', 'proper', 'match', 'be', 'sure', 'one', 'weak', 'point', 'Roberts', 'exploits', 'let', 'be', 'fair', 'What', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'have', 'weak', 'point', 'Roberts', 'plans', 'have', 'backfired', 'desperately', 'George', 'help', 'George', 'be', 'friend', 'Roberts', 'patience', 'wears', 'down', 'when', 'new', 'plan', 'Pretending', 'engaged', 'George', 'make', 'Michael', 'jealous', 'George', 'along', 'clear', 'had', 'whole', 'thing', 'crux', 'matter', 'when', 'Do', 'really', 'love', 'just', 'winning', 'Roberts', 'then', 'lie', 'George', 'determination', 'win', 'lost', 'cause', 'caused', 'lie', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'interesting', 'when', 'see', 'Michael', 'Roberts', 'together', 'can', 'infer', 'relationship', 'had', 'serious', 'flaws', 'usually', 'not', 'always', 'visible', 'tension', 'final', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'stop', 'wedding', 'Roberts', 'something', 'not', 'only', 'deceptive', 'cruel', 'flat', 'out', 'illegal', 'Fraud', 'say', 'least', 'Only', 'then', 'conscience', 'start', 'wake', 'up', 'even', 'learning', 'more', 'life', 'own', 'passions', 'desires', 'still', 'win', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'underlined', 'comical', 'tragic', 'car', 'chase', 'Only', 'Roberts', 'cruelty', 'as', 'well', 'absurd', 'actions', 'realize', 'someone', ""n't"", 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'them.This', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'complete', 'great', 'story', 'superb', 'acting', 'harmonious', 'mixture', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'even', 'more', 'TRIUMPH', 'NOT', 'always', 'getting', 'what', 'want', 'reaching', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'passions', 'desires', 'do', 'what', 'right.While', 'certain', 'sadness', 'restoration', 'order', 'also', 'know', 'right', 'joy', 'reenters', 'when', 'George', 'be', 'real', 'friend', 'there']",N/A

6990,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,0767802683,Busy Body,"[11, 14]","I have always been a fan of Julia Roberts and the movies she stars in - her smile is infectious, it lights up the screen. In 1997, she made a comeback with a starring role in the romantic comedy My Best Friend's Wedding. The film went on to become one of the most successful girly movies of the whole decade, and after watching it earlier tonight on TV, it's not hard to see why. It still holds up seven years later. The comedy is fresh, funky and slick. The plot is nothing original, but it holds up brilliantly because of the film's four main stars. You have Julia Roberts, of course, who is no doubt a future Hollywood legend. Then there's Cameron Diaz in one of her best film roles - not quite topping her sexual cameo in The Mask three years earlier, but still bringing much humour to her role. Rupert Everett and Dermot Mulroney are the two main male actors and also do their roles justice.Julia Roberts plays Julianne Potter, a fast-talking confident Chicago food critic who used to date Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney) in their college days. They since broke up after nine years and moved apart. They made a pact, however, that if by the age of 28 they both were not married, then they would marry each other. When Julianne receives a call from Michael three weeks before that pact deadline, she assumes he is ringing to get back with her. However, Michael is calling to introduce Julianne to his seemingly wonderful, irritatingly perfect fiancee Kimberly Wallace (Cameron Diaz) and announce their wedding which is taking place in just three days. That leaves Julianne three short days to break up the marriage and win back the man she has only just realised she loved all along. She will either win or lose - that's the conclusion. Ronald Bass' perfectly-constructed screenplay keeps the viewer on the edge, forever guessing if she will win her battle. Julianne's gay friend George Downes (Rupert Everett) agrees to help her, but only to a certain extent, and he is a hilarious asset to the comedic intentions put forth by the writers of the film.The film's plot seems at times far-fetched, and it is, but this is a light-hearted, romantic comedy with many clich&eacute;s built in for good measure! The comedy is spot-on - there aren't many laugh out loud moments, but more of a continual giggle-fest that will have you smiling for most of the film. Julia Roberts is a certain crowd-puller. People from all over the world will flock to see her movies, and this one was exception. Cameron Diaz was half the superstar in this film that she is today, and her glowing smile and charasmatic confidence shines through in her ditzy role. Rupert Everett reminds me of Hugh Grant in this film, which can be no bad thing!The film has many memobrable scenes, including Kimberely's hilarious karoke nightclub performance of ""I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself."" The restaurant hilarity of the group's performance of Dianne Warwick's ""I Say A Little Prayer"" is also perfectly executed, with only professional directors pulling it off - amateurs could have easily messed it up big time. The big city bread truck chase is hilarious, and the film has many touching moments. Julianne's constantly foiled attempts to sabotage the impending wedding are brilliant too: most notably the e-mail/falling off the chair scene. This film is pure comedic brilliance. It could have easily fallen flat on its face, but it didn't because of the right balance between fresh actors and excellent dialogue.",5,"A Fantastic, Feel-Good Romantic Comedy!",1096675200,"10 2, 2004",2004,3489,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'movies', 'smile', 'infectious', 'up', 'screen', '1997', 'made', 'comeback', 'starring', 'role', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'My', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'film', 'went', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'girly', 'movies', 'whole', 'decade', 'watching', 'earlier', 'tonight', 'TV', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'still', 'up', 'seven', 'years', 'later', 'comedy', 'fresh', 'funky', 'slick', 'plot', 'nothing', 'original', 'up', 'brilliantly', 'film', 'four', 'main', 'stars', 'have', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'course', 'who', 'doubt', 'future', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'Then', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'roles', 'not', 'quite', 'topping', 'sexual', 'cameo', 'Mask', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'still', 'bringing', 'much', 'humour', 'role', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'male', 'actors', 'also', 'do', 'roles', 'justice.Julia', 'Roberts', 'Julianne', 'Potter', 'fast-talking', 'confident', 'Chicago', 'food', 'critic', 'who', 'used', 'date', 'Michael', ""O'Neal"", 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'college', 'days', 'broke', 'up', 'nine', 'years', 'moved', 'apart', 'made', 'pact', 'however', 'age', '28', 'were', 'not', 'married', 'then', 'would', 'marry', 'other', 'When', 'Julianne', 'call', 'Michael', 'three', 'weeks', 'pact', 'deadline', 'ringing', 'get', 'back', 'However', 'Michael', 'calling', 'introduce', 'Julianne', 'seemingly', 'wonderful', 'irritatingly', 'perfect', 'fiancee', 'Kimberly', 'Wallace', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'announce', 'wedding', 'taking', 'place', 'just', 'three', 'days', 'Julianne', 'three', 'short', 'days', 'break', 'up', 'marriage', 'win', 'back', 'man', 'only', 'just', 'realised', 'loved', 'along', 'will', 'win', 'lose', 'conclusion', 'Ronald', 'Bass', 'perfectly-constructed', 'screenplay', 'viewer', 'edge', 'forever', 'guessing', 'will', 'win', 'battle', 'Julianne', 'gay', 'friend', 'George', 'Downes', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'help', 'only', 'certain', 'extent', 'hilarious', 'asset', 'comedic', 'intentions', 'put', 'forth', 'writers', 'film.The', 'film', 'plot', 'times', 'far-fetched', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'built', 'good', 'measure', 'comedy', 'spot-on', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'more', 'continual', 'giggle-fest', 'will', 'have', 'smiling', 'most', 'film', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'certain', 'crowd-puller', 'People', 'world', 'will', 'flock', 'see', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'exception', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'was', 'superstar', 'film', 'today', 'glowing', 'smile', 'charasmatic', 'confidence', 'shines', 'ditzy', 'role', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'film', 'many', 'memobrable', 'scenes', 'including', 'Kimberely', 'hilarious', 'karoke', 'nightclub', 'performance', 'Just', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'What', 'Do', 'Myself', 'restaurant', 'hilarity', 'group', 'performance', 'Dianne', 'Warwick', 'Say', 'Little', 'Prayer', 'also', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'only', 'professional', 'directors', 'pulling', 'off', 'amateurs', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'messed', 'up', 'big', 'time', 'big', 'city', 'bread', 'truck', 'chase', 'hilarious', 'film', 'many', 'touching', 'moments', 'Julianne', 'constantly', 'foiled', 'attempts', 'sabotage', 'impending', 'wedding', 'are', 'brilliant', 'too', 'most', 'notably', 'e-mail/falling', 'chair', 'scene', 'film', 'pure', 'comedic', 'brilliance', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'fallen', 'flat', 'face', 'did', ""n't"", 'right', 'balance', 'fresh', 'actors', 'excellent', 'dialogue']",N/A

That's the basic  premise.  The laughs come fast and furious when she takes off to break up  the marriage.  She ends up becoming friends with the bride (Cameron Diaz)  and turning everyone's life upside down.  It's a great Julia Roberts movie.  But, let's not forget Rupert Holmes who did such a wonderful job as  Roberts' gay friend, who comes to save the day with a flamboyant charm  (including a hilarious group sing-along of Dionne Warwick's &quot;I Say A  Little Prayer For You&quot;).  And, don't miss the scene where a member of  the wedding party gets her tongue stuck to an ice sculpture of Nude David  (guess where).  The only flaw I can see in the film (and it's a big one) is  the character of Michael, the friend getting married. (For the life of me,  I can't remember the actor's name.) His whole character, and perhaps it's  in the talent of the actor, is weak, uninteresting, and lacking any depth  at all, not to mention that distracting scar on his face.  His lack of  depth might go unnoticed except that he's one of the main characters.

7000,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,0767802683,Deborah Earle,"[0, 1]","I have to agree with the analysis of a recent reviewer who points out the self-centeredness of the lead characters in this Chicago-based tale.Food critic Julianne Potter (Julia Roberts) and sports broadcaster, Michael O'Neil(Dermot Mulroney)had promised while in college that they would marry each other if neither had married before they were 28, which right there makes love seem like a game where they are concerned.But three weeks before Julianne is to turn 28, Michael announces his engagement to a 20-year-old college student named Kimberly Wallace(the always sunny Cameron Diaz), much to Julianne's dismay, and realizing her own feelings for Michael, tries to sabotage the impending nuptials--a scenario which, with the skillful writing of Ronald Bass and the skillful direction of P.J. Hogan becomes one of humor and pathos, rather than just one of completely outright meanness and manipulation.Kimberly embraces Julianne, and after knowing her only a few minutes, makes her her Maid of Honor, a role she pretends to play while trying to create friction between the couple, using various methods,and lastly employing her gay friend, George Downes(Rupert Everett)to pose as her fiance, hoping to make Michael jealous.Much of this film's entertainment value comes from the well-chosen cast. Philip Bosco and Susan Sullivan portray the bride's dignified parents Walter and Isabelle Wallace,Rachel Griffiths and Carrie Preston are Samantha and Mandy Newhouse, like-dressing characters from the South, who will also serve as bridesmaids, Chris Masterson as the Best Man-to-be is a fairly shy, and awkward youth, although, along with a few peer group members, he gives one of the most amusing scenes in the movie, which involves helium,Paul Giamatti plays Richard, an empathetic bellman, Harry Shearer plays Jonathan P.F. Ritt, and M. Emmett Walsh plays Joe O'Neal.More delightful moments occur during an outing at a seafood restaraunt, where, while conjuring up a story behind their fake engagement, George leads everyone in singing Dionne Warwick's ""I Say a Little Prayer"", and when one of the bridesmaids gets her tongue stuck on an ice sculpture.Things come to a head when Julianne follows George's advice and finally reveals her true feelings as Kimberly stumbles upon the scene, and a viewer can only hope for some just resolution.For me, this film has called to mind the lyrics of a 1958 song by Don Cornell called ""Play Some Music for Broken Hearts"", in which the final stanza is: ""Play some music for broken hearts. Play it slower and slower.For our love is over, and tonight we must part...""Maybe it wasn't love. Maybe it was just more a desire to always win at all costs. But it was time for something definite to be done about Michael and Julianne's relationship, and at least someone got to dance at the other's wedding.",5,"...For Their ""Love ""is Over, and Tonight, They Must Part....",1316476800,"09 20, 2011",2011,2835,"['have', 'agree', 'analysis', 'recent', 'reviewer', 'who', 'out', 'self-centeredness', 'lead', 'characters', 'Chicago-based', 'tale.Food', 'critic', 'Julianne', 'Potter', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'sports', 'broadcaster', 'Michael', ""O'Neil"", 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'had', 'promised', 'college', 'would', 'marry', 'other', 'had', 'married', 'were', '28', 'right', 'love', 'seem', 'game', 'where', 'are', 'concerned.But', 'three', 'weeks', 'Julianne', 'turn', '28', 'Michael', 'engagement', '20-year-old', 'college', 'student', 'named', 'Kimberly', 'Wallace', 'always', 'sunny', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'much', 'Julianne', 'dismay', 'realizing', 'own', 'feelings', 'Michael', 'sabotage', 'impending', 'nuptials', 'scenario', 'skillful', 'writing', 'Ronald', 'Bass', 'skillful', 'direction', 'P.J', 'Hogan', 'one', 'humor', 'pathos', 'rather', 'just', 'one', 'completely', 'outright', 'meanness', 'manipulation.Kimberly', 'embraces', 'Julianne', 'knowing', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'Maid', 'Honor', 'role', 'play', 'trying', 'create', 'friction', 'couple', 'using', 'various', 'methods', 'lastly', 'employing', 'gay', 'friend', 'George', 'Downes', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'pose', 'fiance', 'hoping', 'make', 'Michael', 'jealous.Much', 'film', 'entertainment', 'value', 'well-chosen', 'cast', 'Philip', 'Bosco', 'Susan', 'Sullivan', 'bride', 'dignified', 'parents', 'Walter', 'Isabelle', 'Wallace', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'Carrie', 'Preston', 'are', 'Samantha', 'Mandy', 'Newhouse', 'like-dressing', 'characters', 'South', 'who', 'will', 'also', 'serve', 'bridesmaids', 'Chris', 'Masterson', 'Best', 'Man-to-be', 'fairly', 'shy', 'awkward', 'youth', 'few', 'peer', 'group', 'members', 'one', 'most', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'helium', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Richard', 'empathetic', 'bellman', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'Jonathan', 'P.F', 'Ritt', 'M.', 'Emmett', 'Walsh', 'Joe', ""O'Neal.More"", 'delightful', 'moments', 'occur', 'outing', 'seafood', 'restaraunt', 'where', 'conjuring', 'up', 'story', 'fake', 'engagement', 'George', 'everyone', 'singing', 'Dionne', 'Warwick', 'Say', 'Little', 'Prayer', 'when', 'one', 'bridesmaids', 'tongue', 'stuck', 'ice', 'sculpture.Things', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'Julianne', 'George', 'advice', 'finally', 'true', 'feelings', 'Kimberly', 'scene', 'viewer', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'just', 'resolution.For', 'film', 'called', 'mind', 'lyrics', '1958', 'song', 'Don', 'Cornell', 'called', 'Play', 'Music', 'Broken', 'Hearts', 'final', 'stanza', 'Play', 'music', 'broken', 'hearts', 'Play', 'slower', 'slower.For', 'love', 'tonight', 'must', 'part', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'love', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'desire', 'always', 'win', 'costs', 'was', 'time', 'something', 'definite', 'be', 'done', 'Michael', 'Julianne', 'relationship', 'least', 'someone', 'got', 'dance', 'other', 'wedding']",N/A

7007,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,0767802683,Einsatz,"[2, 4]","I like Julia Roberts just as much as anyone, however.....this movie was a whole other matter.  It's a contemptible premise played entirely for laughs.Julia Roberts (as Julianne Potter), is soon turning 28 and once she learns her ex-boyfriend best friend (Dermot Mulroney, as Michael O'Neal) is getting married she plots to break up the nuptials and snag the old boyfriend for herself.  Does she love him?  This is never clear.  Is she capable of loving anyone other than herself?  Doubtful.  But it doesn't matter anyway because she's desperate and she is a nasty schemer and that's what this movie was all about: duplicity.I suppose they thought they were doing a screwball comedy so nothing really matters but getting the laughs.  It certainly wasn't a concern that from the outset they were equating deceit with romance.  In essence, stating that whatever a person does to waylay someone else's groom is not only to be lauded, it's to be applauded.But really, why bother?Let's take the groom at face value.  Here's a guy who thinks nothing of constantly flirting with his ex-girlfriend....in front of the woman he's pledged to marry.  A guy who needed to use his ex-girlfriend for ""courage and support"" through what he obviously saw as troubled times as opposed to a joyous occasion.  A guy who raved about his ex-girlfriend to everyone including his in-laws to be.  A guy who helped humiliate his fianc&eacute;e in a karaoke bar.  A guy who yelled at his fianc&eacute;e during a dinner causing her to become hysterical and still he yelled until she apologized for something that wasn't her doing.  A guy who, when finally told he was being manipulated by his ex, found the whole situation ""flattering!""  So what if his fianc&eacute;e was put through turmoil and stress she didn't deserve, as long as he kept getting his own way everything would be fine.  He gets to have a wife, and, as his ex-girlfriend joked, they could always have affairs.It also wasn't quite clear why Julianne Potter was so desperate to snag a guy she called an ""insensitive doofus.""  Had she forgotten the reason they broke up in the first place?In the end, I couldn't get past the character, Julianne Potter's, behavior (long enough to consider it funny).  She commits both fraud (with the phony email) and a felony (when she steals a van).  Naturally, this being a romantic comedy neither has consequences.  As for her final act of non-contrition: she ""loans"" the newlyweds THE song belonging to her and her ex.  And no one saw the insult in that?  The only thing that keeps this woman from being a stalker is that she was invited into the festivities by her ex-boyfriend, who throughout the film kept sending mixed signals to both women.The thing that kept me from totally hating this movie was the extremely funny performance by Rupert Everett.  Unfortunately, there was too little of him and way too much of Dermot Mulroney.  I did enjoy the sing-a-long dinner party, it was a hoot.  I also loved Cameron Diaz and the helium trio's harmony.  Actually, there were quite a few funny bits that didn't require bail and jail time.  Still, I just couldn't get past the underlining unsavoriness of the victimization involved, that it was meant to be funny, that so many people seem to enjoy such antics and overlooked them as harmless fun.

Roberts is great with comedy, and she definitely is getting better and more comfortable with age and time. I was not at all a Roberts fan in her early career and hated films like Pretty Woman or Sleeping with the Enemy. However, in this film Roberts shines. She plays a very independent and brash food critic who is stunned to find out that her best friend (played by Dermot Mulroney) is going to get married. Suddenly she realises that maybe she was in love with him all along and all the times he tried to turn their relationship into romance, she spurned him. And now, it might be too late.

The story involves Juliette (Julia Roberts), a food critic who realizes she loves her best friend Michael (Dermot Mulroney). Juliette finds out that Michael is getting married and decides to go to stop the wedding from happening, and to try to win him back. From the get go, Juliette is scheming to put a wedge between Michael and his fianc&eacute; Kimmy (Cameron Diaz). Her plans are often foiled and ultimately in the end, in a poignant moment, her friend George (Rupert Everett) asks her if she is chasing Michael and he is chasing Kimmy, who is chasing her?  There are some real fun moments in the movie, like when Juliette pretends she is engaged to her gay friend in order to make Michael jealous. They end up singing ""Say A Little Prayer"" at breakfast. The movie is enriched by a great cast who have chemistry. Julia Roberts convincingly plays Juliette, who should be the enemy, but you end up rooting for her even through her hatched plans.

From the beginning Jules (Julia Roberts) explains how much of a heartbreaker she is. She had dated and left many men. She is independent and career focused. Earlier in college, she turned down her best friend/boyfriend when he wanted their relationship to get serious. Now, twenty-eight, she reflects on the relationship they had. She decides to get in contact with Michael. She expected him to wait for her until she decides she is ready for marriage since he had loved her so much. Basically Jules is the type who is scared of commitment and becomes restless. Then she realizes that Michael was perfect compared to other men. She says she always wanted him, but does not take action until she learns he is about to get married to the annoyingly perfect Kimmy (Cameron Diaz).  Apparently Jules had problems with public affection and sentimental values. It was hard for her to admit she was in love. Quite frankly I find the relationship with Michael and Jules weird. They decided to stay best friends forever. I think it takes a lot of respect to keep that sort of relationship going. Usually couples loose that when they split. Jules' gay best friend comes to help. ""He was in love with me every day for nine years "", Jules tells him.  ""Do you love him or is this just about winning"" George replies. It was tough figuring this out. The hilarious part for me, the comedy part, finally was when George had to pretend he was not gay. George is hilarious. I love how classy and elegant he is. I love the scenes where he tries his best to embarrass Jules. I enjoyed his performances the best out of the whole movie.  The fight scene at the baseball field between Kimmy and Jules was entertaining, but I would have like to see more physical fighting. The film is fairly done.

Armed with her afore-mentioned gay best friend, George, Julianne sets off to Chicago to see what she can do about breaking up the couple and securing Michael for herself.His fianc&eacute;e, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz) is 20 years old and Barbie doll perfect. She doesn't even have a tiny flaw that Julianne can use against her. She is extra-super-nice to Julianne, giving her the position of Maid Of Honour within half an hour of meeting her and bringing all the defences down to admit to her that she is jealous of her relationship with Michael.Julianne is ruthless. She'll do whatever it takes to get Michael back - and she does a lot of it. She tries to embarrass Kimmy at a karaoke bar, but despite a terrible singing voice Kimmy has chutzpah and wins the audience around. In a bid to make Michael jealous, she convinces George to pose as her husband which he does with pizzazz (describing their first meeting, he muses wistfully, ""I knew we'd end up like this - like some glittering Doris Day-Rock Hudson extravaganza""). And finally she writes a nasty email to Michael's boss, supposedly from Kimmy's father.This is the turning point of the movie. Up until now we have seen Julianne as the heroine and Kimmy as the foe who must be obliterated at all costs. And this is perhaps where we realise that maybe this isn't just another run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. But now, maybe we don't want Julianne to win any more. Maybe, just maybe, sweet Kimmy should be the one to end up with Michael. It's not so clear-cut now, and the script keeps us guessing until the end.Roberts gives a great performance here, making Julianne sympathetic even when we don't like her very much. She doesn't have much chemistry with Mulroney as Michael, but then nor does Diaz; perhaps this is the point of the movie. However it is Rupert Everett who manages to steal almost every scene he is in. It's very enjoyable, and slightly black - but only if you want to see that side of it.

He's outstanding as Julia's best friend. Although he's a clich&eacute; (the elegant, intelligent, witty and cultivated gay man), he emerges as a real person and has some of the best lines and definitely the best scene in the restaurant, where they all sing ""I say a little prayer for you"". (I can watch this scene over and over and not get fed up!) The music is another plus in the movie, really carefully chosen not just to support the scene but take an active part in the story.There's not much to hate about this movie. It's one of those very cheery movies, that instantly put a smile on your face. However I HATE the opening credits (as one reviewer before me said, if you hate the opening credits, you'll hate the movie - not true) and I hate Cameron Diaz in this. Hate the hair, hate the look, hate the character, hate the fact she's such a pushover. I also hate the fact you see Julia smoking in this movie, I would have thought she had loads more sense than that, lets hope she's given up for the sake of her unborn twins.The pacing is great with hardly a slowdown in the entire movie. Those times the movie does lessen the pace for a moment are to showcase a tender moment between Julia & Dermot Mulroney. A particularly bittersweet scene is when Julia & Dermot's characters share an afternoon taking a cruise through Chicago's downtown river. They share a song, a hug and look into each other's eyes and we as the audience wait to see if they profess their true love for each other, but the moment passes as they pass under a bridge and into the shadows and we realize that moments are fleeting and love can be fickle.Some of the extras on this are pretty inventive for once, when it claims across the cover it's a special edition. Sometimes those can be a total let down. The extras include: new documentary: ""Unveiled: The Making of My Best Friend's Wedding""; HBO Making-Of: ""On the Set""; Wedding Do's and Don'ts - Helpful Hints for the Soon-to-Be Wed (very funny); My Best Friend's Wedding Album: Behind-the-Scenes Facts and Trivia and ""Say a Little Prayer"" sing-along.This is a great movie to be seen, particularly for Rupert Everett.

7052,A3GK51JW3VWPRV,0767802683,Michael Welch,"[0, 0]","...First, the leading characters are none of them particularly honest, either to others or to themselves. Julianne (Julia Roberts), of course, is the most egregriously deceitful; she continually insists on her love for Michael (Dermot Mulroney) to her gay friend George (Rupert Everett) but in the scene on the tourist boat in the Chicago River when Michael practically invites her to declare her feelings, she allows the moment to pass though she obviously understands its significance. (This is either egocentric self-absorption taken to the max, or an incredibly constricted personality who needs therapy!)Michael too seems to comprehend his real attachment to 'Jules' but apparently has some sort of obsession with a rather adolescent Kimmy (Cameron Diaz), who swings from total adoration of Michael to angry accusation and then back again. All three principals in this strange 'romantic comedy' seem essentially dysfunctional in their intimate relationships and not nearly as self-knowing as they claim. Consequently I found the film fascinating -- because in the guise of 'light' movie fare it is such a trenchant critique of a lack of real communication in contemporary 'love'.The inability to 'risk' needing someone (as George observes) is emblematic, perhaps, of two (now) generations of the children of the divorced. The result seems to be that people like Jules, Michael and Kimmy are incapable of perceiving who they truly are. By the last scenes of the movie I think it is clear that Jules and Michael really should marry and that Kimmy's and Michael's marriage is bound for a courtroom eventually. But then everyone seems only fatalistic about the outcomes -- for instance, every time Julianne attempts her underhanded tricks they seem so abortively transparent that her expression betrays even her dire lack of confidence in what she is doing!This is actually a 'dark' film masquerading as comedy because it portrays ostensible adults who, though extremely competent in their occupations, are, in truth, moral children only half-conscious of their intimate selves. This is not to say that many scenes are not very funny and that all the actors are not at the top of their forms; they surely are. Roberts is extremely good (as well as more beautiful and engaging than ever) as a very bright and appealing but emotionally stunted young woman, and Everett is just a master of looks and timing who even steals scenes from Julie! And Mulroney and Diaz are attractive performers who project a subtle poignancy to their anxious hope that they can be a real married couple.But I must say that my very favorite 'couple', really, in 'My Best Friend's Wedding' is Amanda and Samantha Newhouse (Carrie Preston and Rachel Griffiths), the cousins that Kimmy dismisses so callously as 'vengeful [gifls]' but whose own self-awareness is refreshing. (Mandy accepts the above crude designation as a blithe joke -- Samantha even plays with it by suggesting that 'you can jus' call us eager'!) Both women speak frankly and without pretense, both are kind to others and willing to share in their fun and to aid in whatever way they can. Treated indifferently by especially Kimmy, her mother (Susan Sullivan, who openly insults them) and Julianne, they still join in Jules' way of wishing some sort of happiness to the benighted Michael and Kimmy by singing (charmingly and with great grace) Dorothy Field's and Jerome Kern's wonderful 'The Way You Look Tonight'. Unfortunately the director, P. J. Hogan, gives Preston and Griffiths only very short scenes in which nevertheless both actresses show off their tremendous dual charm so well that the audience can hardly wait to see them again -- for not only are they the most fun, in fact they are the 'best people' in this movie.",5,"Darkly Charming, Or 'You Can Jus' Call Us Eager'!...",1032566400,"09 21, 2002",2002,3771,"['First', 'leading', 'characters', 'are', 'none', 'particularly', 'honest', 'others', 'Julianne', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'course', 'most', 'egregriously', 'deceitful', 'continually', 'love', 'Michael', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'gay', 'friend', 'George', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'scene', 'tourist', 'boat', 'Chicago', 'River', 'when', 'Michael', 'practically', 'declare', 'feelings', 'moment', 'pass', 'obviously', 'significance', 'egocentric', 'self-absorption', 'taken', 'max', 'incredibly', 'constricted', 'personality', 'who', 'therapy', 'Michael', 'too', 'comprehend', 'real', 'attachment', ""'Jules"", 'apparently', 'sort', 'obsession', 'rather', 'adolescent', 'Kimmy', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'who', 'swings', 'total', 'adoration', 'Michael', 'angry', 'accusation', 'then', 'back', 'again', 'three', 'principals', 'strange', ""'romantic"", 'comedy', 'seem', 'essentially', 'dysfunctional', 'intimate', 'relationships', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'self-knowing', 'claim', 'Consequently', 'found', 'film', 'fascinating', 'guise', ""'light"", 'movie', 'fare', 'such', 'trenchant', 'critique', 'lack', 'real', 'communication', 'contemporary', 'inability', ""'risk"", 'needing', 'someone', 'George', 'observes', 'emblematic', 'perhaps', 'two', 'now', 'generations', 'children', 'divorced', 'result', 'be', 'people', 'Jules', 'Michael', 'Kimmy', 'are', 'incapable', 'perceiving', 'who', 'truly', 'are', 'last', 'scenes', 'movie', 'think', 'clear', 'Jules', 'Michael', 'really', 'should', 'marry', 'Kimmy', 'Michael', 'marriage', 'bound', 'courtroom', 'eventually', 'then', 'everyone', 'only', 'fatalistic', 'outcomes', 'instance', 'time', 'Julianne', 'underhanded', 'tricks', 'seem', 'so', 'abortively', 'transparent', 'expression', 'betrays', 'even', 'dire', 'lack', 'confidence', 'what', 'doing', 'actually', ""'dark"", 'film', 'masquerading', 'comedy', 'ostensible', 'adults', 'who', 'extremely', 'competent', 'occupations', 'are', 'truth', 'moral', 'children', 'only', 'half-conscious', 'intimate', 'selves', 'not', 'say', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'top', 'forms', 'surely', 'are', 'Roberts', 'extremely', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'beautiful', 'engaging', 'ever', 'very', 'bright', 'appealing', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'young', 'woman', 'Everett', 'just', 'master', 'looks', 'timing', 'who', 'even', 'steals', 'scenes', 'Julie', 'Mulroney', 'Diaz', 'are', 'attractive', 'performers', 'who', 'project', 'subtle', 'poignancy', 'anxious', 'hope', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'married', 'couple.But', 'must', 'say', 'very', 'favorite', ""'couple"", 'really', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'Amanda', 'Samantha', 'Newhouse', 'Carrie', 'Preston', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'cousins', 'Kimmy', 'so', 'callously', ""'vengeful"", '[', 'gifls', ']', 'own', 'self-awareness', 'refreshing', 'Mandy', 'above', 'crude', 'designation', 'blithe', 'joke', 'Samantha', 'even', 'suggesting', ""'you"", 'can', 'jus', 'call', 'eager', 'women', 'speak', 'frankly', 'pretense', 'are', 'kind', 'others', 'willing', 'share', 'fun', 'aid', 'way', 'can', 'Treated', 'indifferently', 'especially', 'Kimmy', 'mother', 'Susan', 'Sullivan', 'who', 'openly', 'insults', 'Julianne', 'still', 'join', 'Jules', 'way', 'wishing', 'sort', 'happiness', 'benighted', 'Michael', 'Kimmy', 'singing', 'charmingly', 'great', 'grace', 'Dorothy', 'Field', 'Jerome', 'Kern', 'wonderful', ""'The"", 'Way', 'Look', 'Tonight', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'P.', 'J.', 'Hogan', 'Preston', 'Griffiths', 'only', 'very', 'short', 'scenes', 'nevertheless', 'actresses', 'show', 'off', 'tremendous', 'dual', 'charm', 'so', 'well', 'audience', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'see', 'again', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'most', 'fun', 'fact', 'are', ""'best"", 'people', 'movie']",N/A

Starring the cutest, sweetie pie bad actress of all time, Julia Roberts, in the cutest, sweetie pie backdrop ever, who turns it into a semi screwball comedy (the one saving grace) and an all out fest of shrewish behavior and jealousy.Julia Roberts plays her every woman self who is fretting over the arrival of her friend, Dylan McDermott, into her native Chicago.  The two former flames have agreed that if they do not find someone to love by the age of 28 they will marry each other.  The witching hour is approaching and she confides to her sassy gay man friend that she doesn't want to go through with it.  Imagine her surprise when she hears that McDermott has met the woman of his dreams, Cameron Diaz, and although it's sudden has decided that she is in fact The One.  And then what happens?  Is Julia Roberts relieved that she doesn't have to join in this dreaded union?  Is she happy that McDermott is happy?  Of course not.  In typical irrational female mentality, she becomes jealous and furious that he is not catering to her needs.The rest of this movie is a series of plots that Julia is attempting to put the kabosh on the wedding, which are mean spirited and self centered but are hidden thinly under some screwball comedy and hijinx.  I was chanting ""Kill the bitch!"" halfway into it.And that scene where she and McDermott are under the shadow of the bridge?!  Where he's talking about moments that you miss and things right in front of you, then when they come out from under the shadow of the bridge and he turns away.  Was that supposed to be sentimental?!  While everyone in the theater was in tears I was also because we were on the verge of two people actually making some kind of connection in this movie and we missed it!  Whoa to the chick flick genre.The one saving grace was Rupert Everett, the sassy gay friend.  He was a gem and continues to be, even if it was a now somewhat typical role as the gay man companion to a lone strait woman.  He was by far the funniest, and displayed the most talent.  Cameron Diaz isn't bad either now that I think of it.The ending made me want to puke.  After she reviels that she had been behind all the sabbatage, both Cameron and McDermott forgive her?

Julia Roberts can easily lapse into blandness (see CONSPIRACY THEORY), but she does make Julianne human in spite of her selfish actions.  While we may never root for her (there is no doubt that Cameron Diaz is the truly better match for Dermot Mulroney's character), by the end, when Julianne regains her senses, we finally can feel her loss. Roberts plays the love-confession and the poignant farewell scenes so well that we may be thinking back to our own love losses with a tinge of remorse or, at least sentiment.  Kudos also to Rupert Everett, unfairly robbed of an Oscar nomination, for his brilliant, unforgettable portrayal of Julianne's surrogate best friend, George.  George seems to be th! e only voice of reason left in Julianne's life and if more movie (and real-life) friendships were this open, decent, and genuine, the world would be a better place and there would be no need for the glut of talk show deviates which populate the airwaves.

7068,A1LDIMQISH07WK,0767802683,Rebecca,"[1, 2]","MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDDING is a hilarious romantic-comedy. Julia Roberts is truly at her best in this film as Julianne, a food critic who's long-time childhood best friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney) is getting married to some other woman, just when Julianne starts to have feelings for him! The woman Michael is marrying is Kimberly (Cameron Diaz), a college student with a fillthy-rich father. Julianne is hopelessly in love with Michael, so to get Michael back, Julianne must find a way to stop the wedding and make Michael fall in love with Julianne herself! She gets her partner and friend, George (Rupert Everett), to help her win over Michael. The ending is actually surprising, because you'd think Julianne wins back Michael, but she actually doesn't. So it is good to see the protagonist in a film to not get what they want in the end, but can still have a happy ending. The whole cast is absolutely superb! And one of my favorite scenes is when Julianne and George pretend that they just got engaged (George is really gay), and while meeting Kimberly's family for dinner and they ask how George proposed to Julianne, George starts singing the song ""I Say A Little Prayer"", and then everyone else in the cast starts joining in, except for Julianne and Michael. It's a very funny movie with a witty script. If you have not yet seen MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING, then what are you waiting for?

It is not what I would call a chick flick as I believe this film appeals equally to both men and women. It has much to recommend it but as I sort through the strengths of the film, including the story, the performances and the direction, I keep going back to the sound track as the biggest highlight. There are several Burt Bacharach/Hal David songs sprinkled throughout, &#34;Wishin' and Hopin'&#34;, &#34;I'll Never Fall in Love Again&#34;, &#34;I say a Little Prayer (for You)&#34; and others. The wedding party version of &#34;I Say a Little Prayer&#34; is the absolute highlight of the film musically and comically...and is one of the funniest scenes on film! In addition to a fine comic performance by Roberts, also look for superb performances from Cameron Diaz, Dermot Mulroney; and the best performance in the movie, by Rupert Everett....who got an Oscar nomination as a reward. The secondary support performances are also excellent, including Rachel Griffiths and Carrie Preston who play profane sisters; and Paul Giamatti in a small, but important role as a hotel bellman.

Flying to Chicago for the wedding, and keeping her agenda secret from all but her real best friend, Rupert Everett, she meets Kim (Cameron Diaz), her apparent rival.  Impeccably sweet, pretty and noble, Kim latches onto Roberts' character clueless as to every plot thrown her way.  Without an ounce of guile, and completely by accident, Kim manages to unwittingly outwit each scheme Roberts throws her way, forcing the critic to resort to ever crueler (and actually uninventive) plans.  Dermot Mulroney plays the guy they fight over, though he seems too cold a guy to have ever fallen for Diaz's seemingly bottomless sunniness.  Rupert Everett practically steals the movie as the only person Roberts is honest to...about anything.

Let me tell you, if you don't like the opening credits, you probably won't like the movie.I resisted this movie a long time -- when they were promoting it when it was in the theatres, they kept showing two clips on TV --an airport scene, and a scene in a car. Neither one made this seem like such a great movie, IMO.Recently, I couldn't decide what video to rent (as usual); I knew I wanted a comedy, but I just didn't know which one. For some reason, I decided to give this a shot. Oh, am I glad I did.This is a smart and funny movie. It is not lightweight fluff. But even more important, there is a scene in a restaurant where a tableful of people break out into song that is absolutely priceless. I was smiling so much I thought my face would break. It's one of those euphoric movie moments that unfortunately come all too infrequently. I watched that scene at least a dozen times, smiling, laughing, and just feeling so darn GOOD!!The only weak point of the movie is Dermot Mulroney. What a dull actor.But Julia, ah Julia.

About to reach that age, and newly unsure if she's doing fine on her own as a successful food writer in New York City, Julianne gets a call from Michael announcing his upcoming wedding to the young, rich and ebullient Kimmy (Cameron Diaz).  Julianne suddenly feels she's always loved Michael, and resolves to win him back for herself.  Kimmy, who turns out to be very sweet, asks her to be her maid of honor, a position from which Julianne plots her sabotage.  Along the way, she enlists her gay editor and friend George (Rupert Everett) to pose as her own fiance to make Michael jealous.From there things get increasingly complicated, until it's hard to tell whom we should root for, something even Julianne has her doubts about, calling herself a ""bad guy"" for seeking to wreck what looks to be a happy couple.  Despite keeping us off-balance that way, the movie remains basically a sweet romantic comedy with plenty of charm, a nuanced performance from Roberts, some touching moments of friendship, and some scene stealing from Everett, including a famous scene in which he gets a room full of people to spontaneously sing the old Dionne Warwick hit ""I Say a Little Prayer (for You).""

Along with ""The Titanic,"" ""Everafter,"" and ""Sleeping With the Enemy,"" this is one of my favorite girly movies. Roberts is a very convincing lead character. Although we may argue that her actions are reprehensible, we will probably realize that often our emotions can override our sense of morality. It is very well done how she is first presented as an admirable self sufficient woman. However, her frustrations soon lead to the gradual degeneration of her character. (Dishonesty, getting drunk, etc). Without ruining the ending, her return to humanity is beautifully done and touching. It allows us to forgive her reprehensible actions, and feel sorry for her. Kim is fine as a picture of untainted youth and innocence who must eventually face a harsh reality. Michael is fine as a man who convincingly shows us the joys and anxieties of entering into the sacrament of marriage. George is EXCELLENT revenge on homophobia. He is Julia's most loyal friend; he offers his support through her pain and sorrow and anxieties; he tries to be always compassionate and honest; and he is perhaps the only real constant voice of reason in the whole movie. I will conclude by saying that sorrow, beauty, and comedy march along side by side in this wonderfully constructed movie. We are offered a familiar story with some original twists.

Having watched it on video a few years later, I find it unfortunate that some of the luster has worn off.  Perhaps seeing it in a theater with a good crowd was the difference; perhaps it's actually noticing how much larger the cellphones in 1997 were than the ones today.  (And what about in five more years . . . ?)This is not to say that it's not a good movie.  It is, and the director and writer are to be commended for so many different, wonderful touches (the shadowed boat scene and smoking bellhop scene come to mind).  Julia Roberts, beautiful and vibrant as always, shines as a New York food critic summoned on short notice by her best (male) friend, a former lover and possible soulmate (Dermot Mulrooney), to provide moral support at his wedding in Chicago.  The plot revolves around Roberts' often backfiring efforts to break up the wedding and claim the groom for herself, usurping his rich, blonde, ""perfect"" fiancee Kimmie (Cameron Diaz), who may be more than she seems.  Rupert Everett virtually steals the show as Roberts' gay friend George, who alternates between mildly assisting in the scheme and functioning as her counselor and conscience.  A variety of characters, from the normal to the bizarre, round out the wedding party.  (Note: the Amazon.com Essential Review is incorrect when it names Roberts' character as a Chicago food critic.  It's clearly stated at one point that she's from NY, and she has to fly to the wedding.  I mean, Chicago's big, but still . . .)A solid 3-1/2 to 4 star effort.  Recommended for fans of Roberts and those looking for a film that incorporates both comedy and romance without quite being a romantic comedy--in other words, an energetic, bittersweet blend with a beautiful anti-heroine whose actions and motivations provoke sympathy and concern in equal measure.  With music, dancing, singing, a chase in a bread truck and an ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David, this one just about has it all.

7090,A2DWWZ6QIWBJ8D,0767802683,"Thomas ""moviedudereviews""","[1, 2]","First off, Julia Roberts to me is an actress who has become more beautiful with age even to this day. Having said that, I was anxious to see this movie because of her and Cameron Diaz. I have seen My Best Friend's Wedding three times and I must admit that I have viewed it differently each time I've seen it. What I mean by this is that I have never really been able to decide which woman the groom should end up with; his bride-to-be or his best friend. Granted, Julia does every rotten thing she can in this film to break up her best friend's wedding so from that viewpoint I favored him ending up with Cameron. On the other hand as one reviewer put it, Julia and her best friend had more chemistry than the groom and his bride-to-be so from that viewpoint I also favored him ending up with Julia. During the film, there are times when I rooted for Julia to get her man despite her despicable efforts to win him over yet other times I wanted Cameron to end up with the groom. This movie still entertains me even after knowing the outcome. Aside from the simple plot of breaking up the wedding, this film has good humor, good acting, a decent soundtrack, and is overall a believable chick flick for the most part. Even guys like myself should find it to be entertaining as I am normally picky when it comes to chick flicks. The special edition dvd is worth picking up if you haven't seen the features. One of the featurettes shows the original alternative ending which is much different from how the film originally ended. Which of the two endings are better? Only the viewer can decide. As for me, I'm not telling. Anyway, the bonus features are overall good and plentiful. The only problem is that the camera focus on one of the featurettes is somewhat off and distorts the picture a bit. Nothing too serious but very noticable. I suppose a sequel to this movie would have been interesting but then who knows how well it would turn out?",4,a unique wedding film with conflicting emotions,1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,1939,"['First', 'off', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'actress', 'who', 'become', 'more', 'beautiful', 'age', 'even', 'day', 'Having', 'said', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'movie', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'have', 'seen', 'My', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'three', 'times', 'must', 'admit', 'have', 'viewed', 'differently', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'What', 'mean', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'able', 'decide', 'woman', 'groom', 'should', 'end', 'up', 'bride-to-be', 'best', 'friend', 'Granted', 'Julia', 'rotten', 'thing', 'can', 'film', 'break', 'up', 'best', 'friend', 'wedding', 'so', 'viewpoint', 'favored', 'ending', 'up', 'Cameron', 'other', 'hand', 'one', 'reviewer', 'put', 'Julia', 'best', 'friend', 'had', 'more', 'chemistry', 'groom', 'bride-to-be', 'so', 'viewpoint', 'also', 'favored', 'ending', 'up', 'Julia', 'film', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'rooted', 'Julia', 'get', 'man', 'despicable', 'efforts', 'win', 'over', 'yet', 'other', 'times', 'wanted', 'Cameron', 'end', 'up', 'groom', 'movie', 'still', 'even', 'knowing', 'outcome', 'Aside', 'simple', 'plot', 'breaking', 'up', 'wedding', 'film', 'good', 'humor', 'good', 'acting', 'decent', 'soundtrack', 'overall', 'believable', 'chick', 'flick', 'most', 'part', 'Even', 'guys', 'should', 'find', 'be', 'entertaining', 'am', 'normally', 'picky', 'when', 'chick', 'flicks', 'special', 'edition', 'dvd', 'picking', 'up', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'features', 'One', 'featurettes', 'original', 'alternative', 'ending', 'much', 'different', 'how', 'film', 'originally', 'ended', 'Which', 'two', 'endings', 'are', 'better', 'Only', 'viewer', 'can', 'decide', ""'m"", 'not', 'telling', 'Anyway', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'overall', 'good', 'plentiful', 'only', 'problem', 'camera', 'focus', 'one', 'featurettes', 'somewhat', 'off', 'picture', 'bit', 'Nothing', 'too', 'serious', 'very', 'noticable', 'suppose', 'sequel', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'then', 'who', 'how', 'well', 'would', 'turn', 'out']",N/A

(And this movie is rated PG-13???)  Kids in junior high have more intelligence than this.  The movie is just vapid Hollywood nonsense.
