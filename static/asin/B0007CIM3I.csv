I saw this made-for-tv movie years ago, and was delighted to find it available on dvd.Della plays a sad figure of a woman who has suffered the most devastating loss any woman can endure: the loss of her baby boy. I won't give any more of the story line away, thus spoiling it for those who have not yet seen it, but I do recommend this movie.",5,Della At Her Best!,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,447,"['have', 'loved', 'incomparable', 'Della', 'Reese', 'years', 'best', 'sweet', 'endearing', 'film', 'saw', 'made-for-tv', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'available', 'dvd.Della', 'sad', 'figure', 'woman', 'who', 'suffered', 'most', 'devastating', 'loss', 'woman', 'can', 'endure', 'loss', 'baby', 'boy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', 'story', 'line', 'away', 'thus', 'spoiling', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'do', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A
879843,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,B0007CIM3I,a voice of reason,"[8, 8]","This movie falls under the category of what most people call a 'chick flick', but if you like family-oriented movies, then you'll enjoy this one whether you are a man or a woman. This is a wonderfully-done tale of reconciliation and forgiveness within two different families. Yes, the ending is overly predictable, but that's okay because getting there is so rich and rewarding.The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was the horribly fake Southern accents that Meredith Baxter and Patricia Heaton used. It's too bad that most people probably think of these two actresses as their characters Elise Keaton and Deborah Barone - those phony accents will likely make you cringe at first if you think of these two characters they played. I got past this little flaw quickly though, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. An added plus is the fact that it has zero sex or profanity (in spite of the antagonism between some of the characters - see, Hollywood, it can be done!!).ADDENDUM: If you enjoy movies with plotlines such as this one, then you may also want to take a look at ""A Family Thing"" and ""Waterproof""; these two movies are, in my opinion, even better than ""Miracle in the Woods"" (although ""A Family Thing"" is one of those unfortunate examples of a well-done movie that is marred by needless profanity; ""Waterproof,"" made by a Christian film company, is a safer choice for family viewing).",4,Good for the whole family,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,1403,"['movie', 'category', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'call', ""'chick"", 'flick', 'like', 'family-oriented', 'movies', 'then', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'one', 'are', 'man', 'woman', 'wonderfully-done', 'tale', 'reconciliation', 'forgiveness', 'two', 'different', 'families', 'Yes', 'ending', 'overly', 'predictable', 'okay', 'getting', 'so', 'rich', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'horribly', 'fake', 'Southern', 'accents', 'Meredith', 'Baxter', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'used', 'too', 'bad', 'most', 'people', 'probably', 'think', 'two', 'actresses', 'characters', 'Elise', 'Keaton', 'Deborah', 'Barone', 'phony', 'accents', 'will', 'likely', 'make', 'cringe', 'first', 'think', 'two', 'characters', 'played', 'got', 'past', 'little', 'flaw', 'quickly', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'added', 'plus', 'fact', 'zero', 'sex', 'profanity', 'spite', 'antagonism', 'characters', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'be', 'done', '.ADDENDUM', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'plotlines', 'such', 'one', 'then', 'may', 'also', 'want', 'take', 'look', 'A', 'Family', 'Thing', 'Waterproof', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'opinion', 'even', 'better', 'Miracle', 'Woods', 'A', 'Family', 'Thing', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'examples', 'well-done', 'movie', 'marred', 'needless', 'profanity', 'Waterproof', 'made', 'Christian', 'film', 'company', 'safer', 'choice', 'family', 'viewing']",N/A

A hint of mystery stirs the trees around a little cabin in the woods. The cabin dweller, played by Della Reese, holds the answers. Della's character has some memory loss but flashbacks bring past troubles to full circle, in the end. I thought that all the actors did a fine job and the story was one that I will never forget. The ending has some inspirational surprises that I never saw coming. I just love it when you can not figure out exactly where the story is going to take you.

I agree that Della Reese did a great job playing a character who had suffered a terrible loss, but the two sisters were just kind of blah. I thought it was odd that Wanda would allow the teenaged girl to go and spend time with a woman she knew nothing about, and who had shot at them, and especially when it became clear that she wasn't lucid much of the time, and that Wanda didn't tell Sarah. That was all terribly irresponsible. I couldn't believe that Sarah's mother would leave her only a chair in her will, or that it is the law that if someone lives on your property, without your knowledge, long enough, they have legal right to stay there. That is whack!I also thought the ending was strange. What happened with Sarah's husband?If you want to see a much better film, with Della Reese playing a similar role, watch ""Chasing Secrets.""
