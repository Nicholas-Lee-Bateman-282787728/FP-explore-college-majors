1662525,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00DYA7Y8Y,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[13, 16]","Goyo is a 17 year old gay teen, very close to his twin sister Rosa.  They live  in the Coachella Valley of California, where their parents work as migrant farm workers in the grape fields.  His father, Ramon, does not accept his son's sexual orientation, and is verbally and physically abusive to him and his mother, whom he somewhat blames for it. The problem worsens after Goyo had a tryst with a new young man in the camp, who Rosa later becomes interested in an starts dating.  Ramon throws Goyo out of the house for trying to seduce his sister's fianc&eacute;.This is an emotional, well-acted 2010 coming-of-age film, written by a screenwriter who based it on his own family.  I felt the characters of the sister and the mother were rather one-dimensional, and would have liked to see more development there.  Overall, however, this is a touching story that illustrates how society's preconceptions can hurt a young man such as Goyo.This film is bilingual, since the older generation talks in Spanish while the younger ones speak English.  You can choose English or Spanish sub-titles on the DVD.  There are no other extras.  I give the film 4 stars out of 5.",4,Coming of age in migrant farm family,1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,1164,"['Goyo', '17', 'year', 'old', 'gay', 'teen', 'very', 'close', 'twin', 'sister', 'Rosa', 'live', 'Coachella', 'Valley', 'California', 'where', 'parents', 'work', 'migrant', 'farm', 'workers', 'grape', 'fields', 'father', 'Ramon', 'not', 'accept', 'son', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'verbally', 'physically', 'abusive', 'mother', 'whom', 'somewhat', 'problem', 'Goyo', 'had', 'tryst', 'new', 'young', 'man', 'camp', 'who', 'Rosa', 'later', 'becomes', 'interested', 'starts', 'dating', 'Ramon', 'Goyo', 'house', 'trying', 'seduce', 'sister', 'fianc', 'eacute', '.This', 'emotional', 'well-acted', '2010', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'written', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'based', 'own', 'family', 'felt', 'characters', 'sister', 'mother', 'were', 'rather', 'one-dimensional', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'development', 'there', 'Overall', 'however', 'touching', 'story', 'how', 'society', 'preconceptions', 'can', 'hurt', 'young', 'man', 'such', 'Goyo.This', 'film', 'bilingual', 'older', 'generation', 'talks', 'Spanish', 'younger', 'ones', 'speak', 'English', 'can', 'choose', 'English', 'Spanish', 'sub-titles', 'DVD', 'are', 'other', 'extras', 'give', 'film', '4', 'stars', '5']",Waterberry Tears

I finally just accepted that I was going to watch a full-length student film. Ultimately, it was an admirable effort. The actors did surprisingly well (once I was able to get past the poor film quality.) The writing was ok. I don't regret watching it because I study gay cinema and it's valuable for that reason. I do regret paying to watch it. I was sick with the flu and this took too much effort to enjoy (getting past all the flaws.) I wanted something comforting...more palatable, more quality.
