867143,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,B0006GAO40,C McGhee,"[4, 6]","This simple story line had the potential to really shine with Jayne Kennedy as the female lead. She plays the true champions prize as the male lead chases & gets all that doesn't count. Towards the end she's still trying to teach him howto be a man.The sad truth here though is the story appears to be nothing but what a white man would think a black boxers life is really like. By the way, I'm white. Leon the Lover is a toon & once you get past the St. Louis Assassin all the other boxers are portrayed as toon's. The fight he is to lose for Mr. Big, a six year old could of written & choreographed better. The little sister puts in a good performance where she appears & it would of been better to have more of her on screen with her brother, Jayne & her mother. That doesn't mean a goody goody ending. Just less poor writing, fewer tits & more emotion based scenes. Yes I know its legendary how many breasts are available to boxer's but that was true when Rocky was made. This would of been ten times better written & directed by those folk's. I'm not asking for a change in actors or actresses they did fine with what they were given.In the end it doesn't matter how the boxing storyline goes because this is supposed to be about peoples character & maturity. Thats why so many cartoons as personalities are disappointing. If however, you are going to spend a lot of time in the ring lets not disrespect the talents of real boxers by showing this kinda s**t. Do boxers cheat? Yes! Do they chect like all-star wrestler's? No!I could of lived with a happy love story ending, broken love story ending or everyone winds up with nothing ending. Little sis can live or die. What I can't live with is this paticular story & how it's told. What a waste of good casting. Makes me angry!2 stars for the cast & casting department.",2,Too Bad!,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,1824,"['simple', 'story', 'line', 'had', 'potential', 'really', 'shine', 'Jayne', 'Kennedy', 'female', 'lead', 'true', 'champions', 'prize', 'male', 'lead', 'chases', ""n't"", 'count', 'end', 'still', 'trying', 'teach', 'howto', 'be', 'man.The', 'sad', 'truth', 'here', 'story', 'be', 'nothing', 'what', 'white', 'man', 'would', 'think', 'black', 'boxers', 'life', 'really', 'like', 'way', ""'m"", 'white', 'Leon', 'Lover', 'toon', 'once', 'get', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Assassin', 'other', 'boxers', 'are', 'portrayed', 'toon', 'fight', 'lose', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'could', 'written', 'choreographed', 'better', 'little', 'sister', 'good', 'performance', 'where', 'would', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'more', 'screen', 'brother', 'Jayne', 'mother', ""n't"", 'mean', 'goody', 'goody', 'ending', 'Just', 'poor', 'writing', 'fewer', 'tits', 'more', 'emotion', 'based', 'scenes', 'Yes', 'know', 'legendary', 'how', 'many', 'breasts', 'are', 'available', 'boxer', 'was', 'true', 'when', 'Rocky', 'was', 'made', 'would', 'been', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'written', 'directed', 'folk', ""'m"", 'not', 'asking', 'change', 'actors', 'actresses', 'did', 'fine', 'what', 'were', 'given.In', 'end', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'boxing', 'storyline', 'supposed', 'be', 'peoples', 'character', 'maturity', 'Thats', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'cartoons', 'personalities', 'are', 'disappointing', 'however', 'are', 'going', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'ring', 'lets', 'not', 'disrespect', 'talents', 'real', 'boxers', 'showing', 'kinda', 's**t.', 'Do', 'boxers', 'cheat', 'Yes', 'Do', 'chect', 'all-star', 'wrestler', 'No', 'could', 'lived', 'happy', 'love', 'story', 'ending', 'broken', 'love', 'story', 'ending', 'everyone', 'up', 'nothing', 'ending', 'Little', 'sis', 'can', 'live', 'die', 'What', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'paticular', 'story', 'how', 'told', 'What', 'waste', 'good', 'casting', 'Makes', 'angry', '2', 'stars', 'cast', 'casting', 'department']",Body and Soul
