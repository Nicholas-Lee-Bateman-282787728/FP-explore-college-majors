1282596,A2IWPUK181NIA,B002P8LK5O,"Cody Shay ""Big Yami No Matsuei Fan..""","[9, 11]","Blue Drop is a title that I quite surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  I'm not normally one for yuri or ""yuri-ish"" titles, but this one was quite exceptional.  The relationship between the two girls was handled quite well, and despite the often targeted audience for these titles, there was no overabundance of fan service.The sci-fi story line is also excellent and quite intriguing.  It pulled me in right away and left enough of a lasting impression for me to wish the series had been longer, or hope for an eventual follow-up.  Basically, women from an alternate dimension cross into ours with intentions of conquering our world.  There are no men left in their world, and their population is slowly dying.  However, one Captain finds herself quite taken with the humans she encounters and decides to fight for them.  Yeah, it sounds a bit trivial, but it is told and handled beautifully.You also can't discuss Blue Drop without mentioning the amazing artwork.  The animation, character and location designs are all beautiful.  There is an amazing amount of detail in the art of this series that truly allows it to shine.  The ship designs in particular stand out as a cut above the norm.Despite the action, mytery and sci-fi elements, it's the relationship between the two main characters and the surrounding cast that really make this show something special.  They're very sympathetic characters who truly make you care about them.  In the end, when one of them is forced to make an unimaginable sacrifice, the moment is very touching and heart felt.  It is one of the better anime endings I have seen in some time, despite leaving the story a bit open.  (The anime only deals with the very beginning of the manga.)Also, for those interested in a dub, Sentai Filmworks has produced a dub for this show.  It was not available when this set was released last year, but will available in a later set.  So if you must have a dub, you should give the upcoming set a try.",5,A Quality Sci-Fi Series With Excellent Slice of Life and Yuri Elements,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,1971,"['Blue', 'Drop', 'title', 'quite', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', ""'m"", 'not', 'normally', 'one', 'yuri', 'yuri-ish', 'titles', 'one', 'was', 'quite', 'exceptional', 'relationship', 'two', 'girls', 'was', 'handled', 'quite', 'well', 'often', 'targeted', 'audience', 'titles', 'was', 'overabundance', 'fan', 'service.The', 'sci-fi', 'story', 'line', 'also', 'excellent', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'pulled', 'right', 'away', 'left', 'enough', 'lasting', 'impression', 'wish', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'longer', 'hope', 'eventual', 'follow-up', 'Basically', 'women', 'alternate', 'dimension', 'cross', 'ours', 'intentions', 'conquering', 'world', 'are', 'men', 'left', 'world', 'population', 'slowly', 'dying', 'However', 'one', 'Captain', 'quite', 'taken', 'humans', 'encounters', 'decides', 'fight', 'Yeah', 'bit', 'trivial', 'told', 'handled', 'beautifully.You', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'Blue', 'Drop', 'mentioning', 'amazing', 'artwork', 'animation', 'character', 'location', 'designs', 'are', 'beautiful', 'amazing', 'amount', 'detail', 'art', 'series', 'truly', 'shine', 'ship', 'particular', 'stand', 'out', 'cut', 'norm.Despite', 'action', 'mytery', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'surrounding', 'cast', 'really', 'make', 'show', 'something', 'special', ""'re"", 'very', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'who', 'truly', 'make', 'care', 'end', 'when', 'one', 'forced', 'make', 'unimaginable', 'sacrifice', 'moment', 'very', 'touching', 'heart', 'felt', 'one', 'better', 'anime', 'endings', 'have', 'seen', 'time', 'leaving', 'story', 'bit', 'open', 'anime', 'only', 'deals', 'very', 'beginning', 'manga', 'Also', 'interested', 'dub', 'Sentai', 'Filmworks', 'produced', 'dub', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'when', 'set', 'was', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'will', 'available', 'later', 'set', 'must', 'have', 'dub', 'should', 'give', 'upcoming', 'set', 'try']",N/A
1282597,AMYSV3PZLNDCS,B002P8LK5O,Just some old guy.,"[11, 12]","To start with this comes in a standard size DVD case with one DVD on each side,widescreen and the sound is done very well.If you need to have a ton of action in every episode then this is definately not for you. There is action but there are episodes that deal with real life situations,since this takes place at an all girls school. You see the new girl,Mari whom has never been to school before, struggle at first to make friends and then how she has bonded with them.I found this a very likable series. When it comes to the CGI it is incredible in spots,Gonzo had a hand in it, like when Mari first sees Hagino. As a whole the series mixed in real life situations and blended them seamlessly together with ""The Hunt for Red October"". It has suspense,drama and some great visuals when they battle.Even though the it is a subtitle only the voices are excellent as is the music. Both help set the mood of what you are watching.Replay value is all right. I gave it 4 stars because there were a couple of episodes seem to lag a little. Even with that being said I am pleased with the series and was glad that I bought it.As stated in the title. I reviewed the November 17th 2009 release of Blue Drop. I do not know why Amazon imports your reviews when something is re-released as things are subject to change which can change what you are reviewing.However I have ordered the September 7th 2010 release of Blue Drop because it states that it is in both Japanese and English. I myself prefer English and I will update this review after I watch the newest version. I just wish this would have come out in Blu-Ray as some of the colors are so vibrant and this would even better.Yes this is in English 2.0 and they used well known voices like Luci Christain - Monica Rial - Hillary Haag & Britney Karbowski. I am glad to see this out in English. Remember ""English"" applies only to the 2010 release. Also this is the same style of case as the previous release..a single size DVD case with one Disc on each side. Other than it being in English now....nothing has changed that I noticed.",4,"Impressive CGI.....note ""Review of the 2009 release"" see bottom of Review.",1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,2078,"['start', 'standard', 'size', 'DVD', 'case', 'one', 'DVD', 'side', 'widescreen', 'sound', 'done', 'very', 'need', 'have', 'ton', 'action', 'episode', 'then', 'definately', 'not', 'action', 'are', 'episodes', 'deal', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'place', 'girls', 'school', 'see', 'new', 'girl', 'Mari', 'whom', 'never', 'been', 'school', 'struggle', 'first', 'make', 'friends', 'then', 'how', 'bonded', 'them.I', 'found', 'very', 'likable', 'series', 'When', 'CGI', 'incredible', 'spots', 'Gonzo', 'had', 'hand', 'when', 'Mari', 'first', 'Hagino', 'whole', 'series', 'mixed', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'blended', 'seamlessly', 'together', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'suspense', 'drama', 'great', 'visuals', 'when', 'battle.Even', 'subtitle', 'only', 'voices', 'are', 'excellent', 'music', 'help', 'set', 'mood', 'what', 'are', 'watching.Replay', 'value', 'right', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'were', 'couple', 'episodes', 'seem', 'lag', 'little', 'Even', 'being', 'said', 'am', 'pleased', 'series', 'was', 'glad', 'bought', 'it.As', 'stated', 'title', 'reviewed', 'November', '17th', '2009', 'release', 'Blue', 'Drop', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'when', 'something', 're-released', 'things', 'are', 'subject', 'change', 'can', 'change', 'what', 'are', 'reviewing.However', 'have', 'ordered', 'September', '7th', '2010', 'release', 'Blue', 'Drop', 'Japanese', 'English', 'prefer', 'English', 'will', 'update', 'review', 'watch', 'newest', 'version', 'just', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'Blu-Ray', 'colors', 'are', 'so', 'vibrant', 'would', 'even', 'better.Yes', 'English', '2.0', 'used', 'well', 'known', 'voices', 'Luci', 'Christain', 'Monica', 'Rial', 'Hillary', 'Haag', 'Britney', 'Karbowski', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'out', 'English', 'Remember', 'English', 'only', '2010', 'release', 'Also', 'same', 'style', 'case', 'previous', 'release..a', 'single', 'size', 'DVD', 'case', 'one', 'Disc', 'side', 'Other', 'being', 'English', 'now', '.nothing', 'changed', 'noticed']",N/A

Interesting characters, good animation, voice acting and a solid premise are usually the building blocks for a great anime. Blue Drop has all of these things. Even so, it's not very good. The backdrop wasn't explained very well, and the ending was terrible. I don't know if you can even call it an ending at all. The characters are likable and they are developed pretty well, but the whole premise of the story isn't explained very well. The relatonship between the main characters doesn't develop much either. Their romance was supposed to be the main focus, but it was barely lukewarm. It's a shame. This anime had a lot of potential.

1282600,A2QW2HL4QI4TUT,B002P8LK5O,Madeline Z.,"[1, 4]","Blue Drop is different Anime science fiction.  It doesn&#8217;t have robots or mecha combat.  It does have aliens that are going to invade the Earth, but they are all good-looking girls.  Blue Drop is long on human interest issues and short on action.  Its major issues are atonement for guilt and rebellion.  Blue Drop is oriented toward teenagers.  Many of its issues are teen issues and those that aren&#8217;t are presented from the perspective of a teenager.The heroine of the series is Marie, a Japanese teenager.  She is intense, excitable and likeable.  Hagino is an alien female that looks like a teenager.  Throughout most of the series, she is burdened by the guilt that she feels for the disaster that she created.  At times, that makes her seem mechanical and aloof.  In the last three episodes, she comes out of her shell and becomes more intense and emotional.  Unfortunately, we are never given the opportunity to learn much about Hagino as a person.  Azanel is an alien and looks like an adult woman.  Through most of the series, she seems unable to overcome her anger at Hagino, but in the last two episodes, she does a turn around and becomes a significant character.  There are many other characters in Blue Drop, but those are the characters that I feel contributed the most to the conclusion of the story.The story moves at a slow pace, but something interesting manages to happen in all of its episodes except episodes 7 and 8.  Those two episodes are a drag.  The story is divided between what the aliens are doing and what Marie&#8217;s high school is doing.  The majority of the time is given to what her high school is doing.  Hagino is squabbling with her superiors and there is some combat between them.  Usually, the combat is short in duration and not intense.  It is only in the last episode that things heat up.Blue Drop has four major subplots.  One involved how Marie learned what killed all of the other inhabitants of the island on which she lived and how she managed to survive.  The other three are how Hagino resolved the guilt that she felt, why she decided to rebel against her superiors, even though she knew that she would die doing that, and how she tried to deal with Azanel&#8217;s anger at her.I didn&#8217;t like Blue Drop.  It was too teen oriented for me to be able to adapt to.  I was unable to develop any interest in the students at Marie&#8217;s high school and their issues and activities.  I tried to focus on Hagino because she had an adult personality and issues.  That didn&#8217;t work, because Blue Drop is too slanted, both in time and sympathy, toward Marie and her high school.  There didn&#8217;t seem to be time in the story for us to learn anything about Hagino&#8217;s life and how she became the person that she was, but there was always plenty of the time in the story to relate inane events such as Marie&#8217;s problems passing her chemistry final exam.  Hagino moved through the story toward her inevitable demise without a whimper.  Before she died, she managed to make friends with Marie and Hagino seemed satisfied with being able to accomplish that before she died.I&#8217;m glad that I had the opportunity to watch Blue Drop.  Now, I know that I won&#8217;t ever want to buy it or watch it a second time.  I do think that it would be suitable for a teenager, but not for an adult.",2,I didn't like Blue Drop,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,3360,"['Blue', 'Drop', 'different', 'Anime', 'science', 'fiction', '8217', 't', 'have', 'robots', 'mecha', 'combat', 'have', 'aliens', 'are', 'going', 'invade', 'Earth', 'are', 'good-looking', 'girls', 'Blue', 'Drop', 'long', 'human', 'interest', 'issues', 'short', 'action', 'major', 'issues', 'are', 'atonement', 'guilt', 'rebellion', 'Blue', 'Drop', 'oriented', 'teenagers', 'Many', 'issues', 'are', 'teen', 'issues', 'aren', '8217', 'are', 'presented', 'perspective', 'teenager.The', 'heroine', 'series', 'Marie', 'Japanese', 'teenager', 'intense', 'excitable', 'likeable', 'Hagino', 'alien', 'female', 'teenager', 'most', 'series', 'burdened', 'guilt', 'disaster', 'created', 'times', 'seem', 'mechanical', 'aloof', 'last', 'three', 'episodes', 'shell', 'more', 'intense', 'emotional', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'opportunity', 'learn', 'much', 'Hagino', 'person', 'Azanel', 'alien', 'adult', 'woman', 'most', 'series', 'unable', 'overcome', 'anger', 'Hagino', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'turn', 'around', 'significant', 'character', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'Blue', 'Drop', 'are', 'characters', 'feel', 'contributed', 'most', 'conclusion', 'story.The', 'story', 'moves', 'slow', 'pace', 'something', 'interesting', 'manages', 'happen', 'episodes', 'episodes', '7', '8', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'drag', 'story', 'divided', 'what', 'aliens', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'Marie', '8217', 'high', 'school', 'doing', 'majority', 'time', 'given', 'what', 'high', 'school', 'doing', 'Hagino', 'squabbling', 'superiors', 'combat', 'Usually', 'combat', 'short', 'duration', 'not', 'intense', 'only', 'last', 'episode', 'things', 'heat', 'up.Blue', 'Drop', 'four', 'major', 'subplots', 'One', 'involved', 'how', 'Marie', 'learned', 'what', 'killed', 'other', 'inhabitants', 'island', 'lived', 'how', 'managed', 'survive', 'other', 'three', 'are', 'how', 'Hagino', 'resolved', 'guilt', 'felt', 'why', 'decided', 'rebel', 'superiors', 'even', 'knew', 'would', 'die', 'doing', 'how', 'tried', 'deal', 'Azanel', '8217', 's', 'anger', 'her.I', 'didn', '8217', 'Blue', 'Drop', 'was', 'too', 'teen', 'oriented', 'be', 'able', 'adapt', 'was', 'unable', 'develop', 'interest', 'students', 'Marie', '8217', 'high', 'school', 'issues', 'activities', 'tried', 'focus', 'Hagino', 'had', 'adult', 'personality', 'issues', 'didn', '8217', 't', 'work', 'Blue', 'Drop', 'too', 'slanted', 'time', 'sympathy', 'Marie', 'high', 'school', 'didn', '8217', 'seem', 'be', 'time', 'story', 'learn', 'anything', 'Hagino', '8217', 's', 'life', 'how', 'became', 'person', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'always', 'plenty', 'time', 'story', 'relate', 'inane', 'events', 'such', 'Marie', '8217', 'problems', 'passing', 'chemistry', 'final', 'exam', 'Hagino', 'moved', 'story', 'inevitable', 'demise', 'whimper', 'died', 'managed', 'make', 'friends', 'Marie', 'Hagino', 'seemed', 'satisfied', 'being', 'able', 'accomplish', 'died.I', '8217', 'glad', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'Blue', 'Drop', 'Now', 'know', 'won', '8217', 'ever', 'want', 'buy', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'do', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'suitable', 'teenager', 'not', 'adult']",N/A
1282601,AQRDUSJ2OJRMG,B002P8LK5O,suburban dissident,"[2, 3]","Taking place in an Earth-based science fiction setting, Blue Drop's story unfolds in the time just before an impending invasion by an all female race of humanoid aliens. Hagino is the captain of a scouting vessel with a tragic story behind it. Mari is a young girl whose memories have been erased due to the shock of a terrible accident which she alone survived. These girls' lives intertwine as they seek to face their pasts as they learn from and heal one another. But what will happen as danger and chaos closes in around them?Blue Drop has a number of aspects that recommend it. The soundtrack fits the flow and pace of the show quite well and Suara's opening theme is fittingly haunting and tragic. While the plot can drag at times and the emotional triggers are a tad clich&eacute;, Blue Drop packs an emotional punch at the right points. The relationship between Hagino and Mari is really sweet and isn't over sexualized. I did find the sci-fi setting to be quite intriguing and, though it isn't unpacked enough, it kept me quite entertained. I was less than pleased with the ending - mostly because there is too much backdrop left unclear and some main plotlines whimper to a finish instead of ending with a bang (honestly, a story shouldn't leave too many areas to ask ""but wait, what about ...?""). But it comes together well enough. Fans of sci-fi and emotionally driven romance stories (BD reminded me ofMaria Watches Over Us - Season 1on more than one occasion) will find this satisfying.One last note: being all female, the alien race mates with their own ""gender"", meaning this is definitely in the yuri/shouju-ai genre (as might have been obvious from my above comments). However, like Maria Watches over Us, the relationships depicted in the film are almost exclusively emotional (the relationship between two side characters being the only obvious exception) and are very tame (especially in relation to how explicit the manga adaptations are).
