Season 4 was fantastic, but it was at this time that Pierce was up for the role of James Bond and NBC was not certain if they wanted to renew the show. Bonds of Steele, the last episode had great ratings which led to the mini series called season 5 to tie up the show. I loved the fact that after Steele had so many ex-girlfriends, it was time for Laura to have a serious suitor as well. Check out the excellent comedic timing between Pierce and Stephanie in ""Steele Hanging in There"" when the Steeles' return from their honeymoon and throw a dinner party for Gladys Lynch. Also check out the wonderful wardrobe for both. In earlier seasons, the network wanted Stephanie to have a hipper wardrobe. I love the return of her hats and more elegant outfits. Pierce's suites are are gorgeous as well!

991845,AB0GGIQBNB36Q,B000FKO3HG,Ben Milton,"[3, 4]","Season 1,2, and 3 are awsome. I love the first three seasons of this show, it's a romantic comedy with mysteries thrown in for the fun of it. Laura Holt has created this fake boss, who comes to life in a jewel thief. And for the first three seasons, Laura and Remington are chasing each other, as they solve mysteries. Then came season four, which in and of itself, isn't horrible, nor is it great. And in my humble opinion, the series should have ended with season four. Instead of the fake trumped up wedding between Laura and remington on a ship just so remington doesn't have to get his green card, I would have had a real wedding to end it. But instead, we get season five. Which totally goes in a different direction of the previous seasons, they are trailed by an ins agent. To try to catch Remington and Laura not acting like a married couple, so they can deport him. As has been previously stated, this was an attempt by the studio, to promote the actor playing the INS agent. Needless to say, he's terrible. And never really did anything else after the show, anyway. Remember how Laura was always chasing Remington, and that she only had eyes for him. Well in season five, she falls in love with the INS agent. And actually contemplates leaving Remington, the history behind the show is that season three was supposed to be the final show. But, at the last minute. The Studio wanted one more season, so season four. They again tried to end it, by this time. All the actors involved were wanting to end it, so the studio ordered an abbreviated season 5, actually 3 2 part movies. And it's dissappointing, by the time you get to season 4 and five, Pierce and Stephanie look bored and worn out with their parts. Yes season 4 has it's moments, but they're few far and between. I don't even watch season five, I can barely stand season four.",1,where did Mr. Steele go,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,1846,"['Season', '1,2', '3', 'are', 'awsome', 'love', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'show', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'mysteries', 'thrown', 'fun', 'Laura', 'Holt', 'created', 'fake', 'boss', 'who', 'life', 'jewel', 'thief', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'Laura', 'Remington', 'are', 'chasing', 'other', 'solve', 'mysteries', 'Then', 'came', 'season', 'four', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'great', 'humble', 'opinion', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'season', 'four', 'Instead', 'fake', 'trumped', 'up', 'wedding', 'Laura', 'remington', 'ship', 'just', 'so', 'remington', ""n't"", 'have', 'get', 'green', 'card', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'real', 'wedding', 'end', 'instead', 'get', 'season', 'five', 'totally', 'different', 'direction', 'previous', 'seasons', 'are', 'trailed', 'ins', 'agent', 'try', 'catch', 'Remington', 'Laura', 'not', 'acting', 'married', 'couple', 'can', 'deport', 'been', 'previously', 'stated', 'was', 'attempt', 'studio', 'promote', 'actor', 'playing', 'INS', 'agent', 'Needless', 'say', 'terrible', 'never', 'really', 'did', 'anything', 'else', 'show', 'anyway', 'Remember', 'how', 'Laura', 'was', 'always', 'chasing', 'Remington', 'only', 'had', 'eyes', 'Well', 'season', 'five', 'love', 'INS', 'agent', 'actually', 'leaving', 'Remington', 'history', 'show', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'final', 'show', 'last', 'minute', 'Studio', 'wanted', 'one', 'more', 'season', 'season', 'four', 'again', 'tried', 'end', 'time', 'actors', 'involved', 'were', 'wanting', 'end', 'studio', 'ordered', 'abbreviated', 'season', '5', 'actually', '3', '2', 'part', 'movies', 'dissappointing', 'time', 'get', 'season', '4', 'five', 'Pierce', 'Stephanie', 'look', 'bored', 'worn', 'out', 'parts', 'Yes', 'season', '4', 'moments', ""'re"", 'few', 'far', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'season', 'five', 'can', 'barely', 'stand', 'season', 'four']",Remington Steele: Seasons Four & Five
991846,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B000FKO3HG,Brent Butler,"[1, 1]","By the fourth season of this very entertaining show, much of the bloom was off the rose. The off air tension between the leads was making it onto the screen. Often they were able to keep it from showing through, but not always. The on again, off again romance between ""Remington"" and Laura Holt continued to run frustratingly hot and cold. The mysteries, however, continued to be off beat, funny, and interesting.Season Five, however, was really a disaster. It was really just three two hour movies. There was absolutely no chemistry left at all between Piers Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist, and most of the time they didn't even appear on-screen together. The stories were forced and came across as exactly what they were ... marking time to fill out the contract.Stephanie went on to appear in one forgettable TV movie after another, along with a few TV series guest starring roles. Piers went on to become major motion picture box office magic, including four very popular James Bond films. He was the second ""Bond"" to have been delayed from the role by a TV series contract, similar to Roger Moore's situation regarding ""The Saint"". I've always wondered if this disparity in future prospects was telegraphed to everyone late in the series, and caused Stephanie to be somewhat bitter in the last two years. That would explain a lot.There is a lot of conjecture about whether there really was off screen antagonism between Zimbalist and Brosnan. I think the fact that they virtually never share a scene together in the fifth season movies gives a big hint as to the truth about that.",4,"Still entertaining, but the series had tired",1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,1586,"['fourth', 'season', 'very', 'entertaining', 'show', 'much', 'bloom', 'was', 'rose', 'off', 'air', 'tension', 'leads', 'was', 'making', 'screen', 'were', 'able', 'keep', 'showing', 'not', 'always', 'again', 'off', 'again', 'romance', 'Remington', 'Laura', 'Holt', 'continued', 'run', 'frustratingly', 'hot', 'cold', 'mysteries', 'however', 'continued', 'be', 'off', 'beat', 'funny', 'interesting.Season', 'Five', 'however', 'was', 'really', 'disaster', 'was', 'really', 'just', 'three', 'two', 'hour', 'movies', 'was', 'absolutely', 'chemistry', 'left', 'Piers', 'Brosnan', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'most', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'on-screen', 'together', 'stories', 'were', 'forced', 'came', 'exactly', 'what', 'were', 'marking', 'time', 'fill', 'out', 'contract.Stephanie', 'went', 'appear', 'one', 'forgettable', 'TV', 'movie', 'few', 'TV', 'series', 'guest', 'starring', 'roles', 'Piers', 'went', 'become', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'box', 'office', 'magic', 'including', 'four', 'very', 'popular', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'was', 'second', 'Bond', 'have', 'been', 'delayed', 'role', 'TV', 'series', 'contract', 'similar', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'situation', 'regarding', 'Saint', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wondered', 'disparity', 'future', 'prospects', 'was', 'telegraphed', 'everyone', 'late', 'series', 'caused', 'Stephanie', 'be', 'somewhat', 'bitter', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'would', 'explain', 'lot.There', 'lot', 'conjecture', 'really', 'was', 'off', 'screen', 'antagonism', 'Zimbalist', 'Brosnan', 'think', 'fact', 'virtually', 'never', 'share', 'scene', 'together', 'fifth', 'season', 'movies', 'big', 'hint', 'truth']",Remington Steele: Seasons Four & Five

In fact, I think it was the best TV series ever made. Remington Steele was a suberbly done combination of action, adventure, and romantic comedy with very good scripts and fine acting by attractive and appealing people. It was -- and still is -- consistently entertaining and no other series was better. I agree that the addition of Doris Roberts as Mildred Krebs made the second and later seasons even better than the first season, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first season. If you are a fan of Remington Steele you've probably already bought the DVDs of the first three seasons and you'll love this final release too.

991856,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000FKO3HG,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[51, 54]","The debonair ex-con-man and strait-laced detective return in the last two seasons of ""Remington Steele,"" where Steele and Laura solve new mysteries -- and uncover old ones. While the final season is weak compared to the previous ones, the last two seasons are still quite enjoyable and amusing.As the season opens, Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist) returns to England, trying to keep Steele (Pierce Brosnan) from running afoul of Scotland yard. He's masquerades as an assassin while looking for clues to his past -- and a murder happens. But even back in America, their problems don't cease -- and some of them are very funny.Among other things, the agency investigate a wrestler, missing experimental pigs, faux obituaries, a body that fell onto a airline luggage carousel, a self-improvement spa where ""accidents"" keep happening, tell-tale butlers, missing caviar, and deal with an inept would-be detective whose latest scheme gets a man killed. Steele and Laura are even declared dead -- and Mildred (Doris Roberts) is the prime suspect in their ""murder.""And on the personal front, Laura finds a doctored photo of her in a porno, Steele apparently gambles away the agency, and Mildred becomes a radio star. But the fourth season takes a nasty turn when Steele finds that he'll be deported unless he gets a green card -- and it seems that Laura is the only one available...The fifth season was done for contractual reasons, and the stars didn't want to do it, since it led to them losing out on roles they wanted. So, they only did a trio of movies, which rather hastily wrap up the threads of the series -- mainly Steele's past, Steele and Laura's relationship. It's very light on detective work, but it does give us a satisfactory finale.It seems that their faux honeymoon will be as peaceful as their job. Nasty insurance agent Norman Keyes (James Tolkan) is hounding Steele, and an Immigration officer is trying to woo Laura -- and get Steele out of the picture. And then their ""marriage"" is put to the test when a DIFFERENT woman claims to be Steele's wife. And in the two-hour finale, the duo discover the truth about Steele's inheritance and past... and finally deal with their tempestuous half-relationship.The fifth half-season is a half-hearted, rushed finale to the series, but it does manage to wrap things up in a way that viewers will enjoy -- especially the final scenes. But the season preceding it is quite solid, with its mixture of romantic comedy, action and mystery.Okay, few of these mysteries actually resemble anything in real life -- although the pirated music one is pretty entertaining, as is the one where Laura moonlights as a stewardess. But the mysteries are all tightly-written and intelligent, and even the fifth season's more drawn-out episodes are still fairly entertaining.The writers had perfected the mix of comedy and mystery, and weren't afraid to be bizarre (gunsel Santas?). Not to mention that solid, moderately witty dialogue. (""If I were a man would you question it if I told you I was going to enter the Boston Marathon?"" ""I would question why anyone would want to run 26 miles without being chased!"").Laura and Steele finally deal with their tangled, complex relationship, after a stint at a ""relationship issues"" seminar that explodes in their faces.

991864,AOEQZLCRMEYXL,B000FKO3HG,Leon Rosiczkowski,"[5, 5]","I constantly buy DVDs of TV series, as I am an American who has worked overseas almost continuously since 1982. Nearly every purchase has been given away. My Remington Steele DVDS will be with me forever!Wow, have I enjoyed myself in watching all 90+ episodes of the entire series! Regardless of the DVD covers and the popularity of Pierce Brosnan, the show revolves around Laura Holt played by Stephanie Zimbalist. Laura Holt is a great female TV character! Laura is super intelligent, as brave as any male detective seen on TV, physically gifted, and feminine when called for. Laura Holt was a great model of a woman in a man's world of the 80s - today's viewers can quickly identify the obstacles put in the her path as a woman in a non-traditional career. Laura overcomes every hurdle, and it's perfectly clear to every viewer that she is the reason that the Remington Steele agency is described dozens of times as a famous, super-successful detective agency. And through the episodes she is nearly always the only real detective, asking great questions, logically placing the case info together, and 4 times out of 5 identifies the culprit first. The only real difficulty I have in her character is from the writers' having Remington Steele act chauvinistic too often and her lack of a verbal response. I guess that I am sensitive in this area due to my wife's experience in the 80s as she experienced many of the same career difficulties. During my watching of the entire collection of episodes, I became deeply committed to the idea that the Laura character be treated with respect!  That may sound strange but Laura is a WONDERFUL PERSON, who became attracted to a handsome, charming con man.Season Five and Laura:I cannot believe the callousness of the writers in season five. I found it painful how they jerked the Laura character around. The values you saw in her character for four seasons were suddenly throw away; she was now uncertain, indecisive and full of doubt; she was shown as moody; and worst of all was slighted (even insulted) constantly by Remington.  Luckily this season lasts only six episodes! What a sad mess - there are a few great scenes in this season  but they are mixed into a pathetic story line. The MAGIC LAST MINUTE: Laura and Remington almost always seem indifferent towards each other (not a couple at all) UNTIL the MAGIC LAST MINUTE of the episode when they suddenly act as a caring couple. Until the very last scene of the last episode, I was fearful that the writers would have Laura having wasted five years caring about Remington (It was that bad.). However the writers sobered up, this very last scene is a great ending to the series. The affection they show in this last scene should have been obvious through all the entire last season! Despite these below average episodes in season five, I still rated the entire series as FIVE STARS -- There are 90 other episodes that are too good to ignore.As a light-hearted detective series, it has dozens of episodes that I have re-watched. The episode styles vary, some go as far as pure drama and some as far as pure farce. My favorite is a slapstick style comedy episode ""Steele in the Chips"" (written by Zimbalist). Carrying on for five seasons a romance between Laura and Remington was extraordinarily difficult task for the writers without a doubt. I would have understood if Laura and Remington had been allowed to marry after three. The sexual tension in their relationship had to be lowered constantly to extend the romance (I guess married people were judged to have lost their romantic urge?). The writers really do however keep you concerned about the relationship between Laura and Remington ; (Spoiler) they never marry plus they do make love until the end of the fifth year! Try that today, where sex is now endemically casual. The only sad part of their romantic development is the lack of romantic nuances from Remington (touches, hugs, soft words, etc.) until midway through the third year and the only time in the entire five seasons where Remington states that he loves Laura is during a physical beating where he hallucinates that it is Laura who is beating him and says ""I love you"" to her image. As I type this, I am reminded of the English play --  ""Please no sex, we're British!"".Stephanie Zimbalist made me care about Laura!  I found myself wanting Laura to be happy, and safe when danger was present. I attribute this to the success of Stephanie Zimbalist's portrayal of Laura.  Stephanie was extraordinary in the physical ""stunts"", in fact she often was a stunt woman. I watched her in one amazing scene three times: It had her jump to grab a fire escape ladder, swing a leg onto the lowest rung, pull herself up onto the ladder, and climb two steps at a time = all in heels. My second viewing of the scene was to ensure it was Stephanie and the third viewing was to admire her ability. When asked Stephanie could do comedy as well as Pierce Brosnan (Steele) and Doris Roberts (Mildred Krebbs). Her voice inflections were outstanding - soft when needed, harsh when needed - what a wonderful voice in the series (she does several interviews found on the DVDs and there is a clear difference that can be heard, in the series where her voice is almost lyrical at times). There is one BUT about Stephanie's performances, when the scripts were weak the cast often exaggerated word pronunciations in a campy way. In 90+ episodes they all cannot be great, no TV series can say that, not even  I Love Lucy. I admire Stephanie's work and am thankful she was cast as Laura.Pierce Brosnan in an interview included on the DVDS mentions how he modeled his work on Cary Grant. In comparing the two - Pierce in physical comedy was superior (I still laugh as I visualize a scene where he steps into a box with his left foot as he rushes to help a woman and kicks it away - great acting). Pierce is excellent in stating short comedy quips with wonderful facial expressions. Looking at his full body of work as an actor (movies and TV), his best acting was as Remington in year three and year four. Pierce is no where near Cary when romance is the topic - too bad since Remington Steele is primarily a romantic comedy wrapped in a detective format. Frantic comedy (Arsenic and Old Lace or Bringing Up Baby for Grant) is a tie - they are both wonderful. Pierce has difficulty in matching Grant in voice inflections in quieter, dramatic dialog. Brosnan's ""God given voice"" is no match for Cary's. For a romantic comedy TV series in the 80s, he is perfectly cast - handsome, gifted in short bursts of comedy, and physically tall and slender. Despite any negatives I mentioned above, he was excellent as Remington Steele. I only wish that his Remington had been given far more romantic gestures to display his commitment to Laura. Yeah I realize that for five seasons no other women were in his life, thats commitment, but I would have preferred words spoken! I am sure Pierce would have sold the audience that he was a changed man and committed to Laura, no longer the con man she first met.Doris Roberts, who played Mildred Krebbs, was a WOW in every episode she appears! I bet that her character extended the popularity of the series into lasting at least one extra season. I could say WOW a dozen more times about her acting, she was that good.  She put everything into her lines! When she was motherly - she was perfect. When she was stern, she was perfect. When she was asked to be nervous - she as perfect. This is becoming repetitive, continuing adds nothing.Gone after the first season were two characters, who did excellent work (receptionist and another detective). Both were effective in their acting and fit wonderfully in the story lines. As a wish I would liked Murphy, the male detective, to have hanged around to start season two and fade away during the year, as he was the rational counter balance to Laura's infatuation with Remington.Bottom Line: I will enjoy watching episodes for decades more. The series is two decades old now and is GREAT to watch. It will be GREAT to watch after two decades. I have no doubt about that statement!",5,SUPER FUN (with dozens of re-watchable episodes),1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,8152,"['constantly', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'TV', 'series', 'am', 'American', 'who',

Like almost all of the fans I supported the effort to bring it back to life.  Now twenty years later and purchasing all of the DVD sets, I can only say again that I'm sorry to see that it's over.For those who haven't seen the show, season four continued the excellent plot lines and easy banter between the stars.  The truncated season five was made up of three two-part episodes.  I could have done without the Roselli character put in as a rival love interest for Laura.  This may have influenced my rating of this set, but you aren't allowed half star rating so I went with the five star rating.They did however bring a conclusion to the series and that is what's important.  Now I can pull out the season one DVDs and start watching all over again.Highly recommended for season four.  Season five is a reserved recommendation but since they are packaged together you don't have a choice.I just had an additional thought.  Since all the stars are still alive, I'd like to see a 2 hour made for television movie that takes place 20+ years later.

991873,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B000FKO3HG,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[2, 2]","As with Season 3, ""Remington Steele's"" fourth season continued delivering quality episodes. Every level of production--acting, writing, directing--maintained the excellence the show (particularly its producer, Michael Gleason) strove so hard for from day one. Pierce Brosnan continued showing his flair as an actor/leading man by walking the fine line between suave mystery man/pompous boss; Stephanie Zimbalist continued showing her resiliency/unwavering skill as a savvy/level-headed role model who, comically, often had her dignity soiled (in more ways than one: witness how she looked by the end of ""Bonds of Steele""); and Doris Roberts dug for more footing as the secretary who knew she was a valuable asset & strove for more equality with her peers.The episodes never disappoint as the show takes its deft blend of mystery, action and screwball comedy to the max. Picking up from last season's cliffhanging ""Steele of Approval"" (in which the agency's future was hanging by a thread), Laura & Mildred go to London to track down the MIA Steele in the two-part ""Steele Searching"". To their surprise, Mr. Steele has been mistaken by Scotland Yard to be a modern-day Jack the Ripper (a story element frightenly well done); Steele gets tangled up with assassins (with the ""help"" of his friend Daniel Chalmers); and Mildred gets the biggest surprise when Laura tells her the truth: Steele doesn't exist; the man she's been idolizing is a fraud. Other notable episodes: ""Forged Steele"", in which Steele gambles away the agency, but can't remember anything the morning after; ""Corn Fed Steele"" pays homage to Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest""; ""Dancer, Prancer, Donner and Steele"" has the gang surviving a harrowing hostage situation at the hands of three ""Santas""; that episode's follow-up, ""Santa Claus is Coming to Steele""; ""Suburban Steele"" introduces us to Laura's flaky sister, with Laura & Steele's disastrously funny encounter with domesticated life; ""Sensitive Steele"" helped peel away the psychological layers of Laura & Steele's relationship; and ""Beg, Borrow or Steele"" had Laura & Steele returning from a New York trip...and discovering they had been murdered!Again, an impressive list of guest stars for Season 4: Brosnan's wife Cassandra Harris, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. (reprising Chalmers), Terry O'Quinn (way before ""Lost""), Jere Burns, Vincent Schiavelli, comic Louie Anderson, Jennifer Tilly, Michael Constantine (reprising small-time businessman George E. Mulch), Rebecca Holden (from ""Knight Rider""), and the great Rose Marie.But the show had peaked in popularity, and dwindling viewership cancelled the series...almost. A deluge of fan mail (and rumors of Brosnan playing James Bond) changed the network's mind, and so came Season 5...sort of. Some fans regard this season as the worst of ""Remington Steele""---kind of a throwaway season of nothing more than a string of RS movies. Well, they're right, but at least there WAS a Season 5. ""The Steele That Wouldn't Die"" was more of a T.V. movie version of ""Romancing the Stone"", and probably the weakest of the series. Picking up where ""Bonds of Steele"" left off, as Steele & Laura tried to prove to U.S. Immigration--and constantly pesky insurance investigator Norman Keyes, who was determined to expose Steele as a fraud & illegal immigrant--they were the real deal by whisking away to Mexico for a joke of a honeymoon. The series improved with the next one (""Steele Hanging in There"") as Steele's past (in the guise of an old flame, played by ""Superman II's"" Sarah Douglas) came back to haunt him, disrupting (once again) Laura & Steele's honeymoon bliss. The final one (""Steeled With A Kiss"") finally put all the pieces of Steele's puzzled past in place as it tied up loose ends. Chalmers returned with a startling revelation, Steele inherited a castle, and the series' couple--at last!--got both their privacy and happily-ever-after. The weak link to all this was the handsomely deceptive Tony Roselli (Jack Scalia), who was there as a ""romantic triangle"" device...I found him often annoying!Some nifty featurettes are included.

The two lead characters have great chemistry in the show.",4,Remington Steele...one of my faves!,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,550,"['series', 'definitley', 'one', 'time', 'Even', 'older', 'components', 'enjoyable', 'light', 'hearted', 'adventurous', 'romantic', 'series', 'My', 'only', 'dissapointment', 'was', 'end', 'when', 'romantic', 'interest', 'was', 'introduced', 'Laura', 'Holt', 'believe', 'real', 'wedding', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cards', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'last', 'episode', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'revealed', 'couple', 'was', 'truly', 'married', 'Otherwise', 'been', 'fun', 'series', 'watch', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'show']",Remington Steele: Seasons Four & Five
991876,ASF2Z8OJR0TP3,B000FKO3HG,S. T. Peterson,"[1, 1]",This was the Remington Steele I remembered as a kid--season 4. But I too remember how we were teased with the relationship between the two characters. . . how it dragged. And introducing Jack Scalia was just weird. But it reminded me of Moonlighting and why a lot of people just were disgruntled with the show by this point. They burned the show out all on their own. Anyway the similarities don't stop here between Moonlighting and this show. The only show that handled this situation originally during that time period was Scarecrow and Mrs King. But if you can be content with knowing a disappointing ending to the series is coming . . . enjoy season 4.,4,Vintage Steele,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,656,"['was', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'remembered', 'kid', 'season', '4', 'too', 'remember', 'how', 'were', 'teased', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'how', 'dragged', 'introducing', 'Jack', 'Scalia', 'was', 'just', 'weird', 'reminded', 'Moonlighting', 'why', 'lot', 'people', 'just', 'were', 'disgruntled', 'show', 'point', 'burned', 'show', 'out', 'own', 'Anyway', 'similarities', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'here', 'Moonlighting', 'show', 'only', 'show', 'handled', 'situation', 'originally', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'Scarecrow', 'Mrs', 'King', 'can', 'be', 'content', 'knowing', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'series', 'coming', 'enjoy', 'season', '4']",Remington Steele: Seasons Four & Five
991877,A3Q4XAQXKKV6V,B000FKO3HG,William Smith,"[3, 3]","This review contains spoilers because I just cannot contain my surprise at Season 5!I'm fairly new to the show, but not so new as not to hear the lambasting Season 5 recieves. All I've heard about is how Rem and Laura should never have been married etc etc, so here I am picturing a watered down version of the show while the couple sit at home flipping through the channels.... what all the reviews do NOT mention (for some reason) was the delicious circumstance that produces the marriage! I will stop short of spilling all the beans however, their marriage of RELUCTANCE is a hell of a lot more fun than many of dull Season 4 episodes! Hell, I even like Jack Scalia.Season 4 had it's share of high points; like Forged Steele, but I found far far too many weak scripts and MANY that did NOTHING for the Rem and Laura relationship (the reason I watch this show). I found Season 5's Mexico debut ""The Steele That Wouldn't Die"" to be as fun and as good as anything the series had produced in turn I found Season 4's opener ""Steele Searching"" to be a real mess that did NOT live up to the story elements set up by Season 3's conclusion.However you look at it, this season with all its backstory is well worth the $20 it currently goes for. I seriously doubt either Zimbalist nor Brosnan will ever don these characters again so these episodes are sands in an hour glass that must be turned over and viewed again and again.",4,They Steele had it!,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,1419,"['review', 'spoilers', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'contain', 'surprise', 'Season', '5', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'new', 'show', 'not', 'so', 'new', 'not', 'hear', 'lambasting', 'Season', '5', 'recieves', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'how', 'Rem', 'Laura', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'etc', 'etc', 'here', 'am', 'picturing', 'watered', 'version', 'show', 'couple', 'sit', 'home', 'flipping', 'channels', 'what', 'reviews', 'do', 'NOT', 'mention', 'reason', 'was', 'delicious', 'circumstance', 'marriage', 'will', 'stop', 'short', 'spilling', 'beans', 'however', 'marriage', 'RELUCTANCE', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'many', 'dull', 'Season', '4', 'episodes', 'Hell', 'even', 'Jack', 'Scalia.Season', '4', 'had', 'share', 'high', 'points', 'Forged', 'Steele', 'found', 'far', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'weak', 'scripts', 'MANY', 'did', 'NOTHING', 'Rem', 'Laura', 'relationship', 'reason', 'watch', 'show', 'found', 'Season', '5', 'Mexico', 'debut', 'Steele', 'That', 'Would', ""n't"", 'Die', 'be', 'fun', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'series', 'had', 'produced', 'turn', 'found', 'Season', '4', 'opener', 'Steele', 'Searching', 'be', 'real', 'mess', 'did', 'NOT', 'live', 'up', 'story', 'elements', 'set', 'up', 'Season', '3', 'conclusion.However', 'look', 'season', 'backstory', 'well', '20', 'currently', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'Zimbalist', 'Brosnan', 'will', 'ever', 'don', 'characters', 'again', 'episodes', 'are', 'sands', 'hour', 'glass', 'must', 'be', 'turned', 'viewed', 'again', 'again']",Remington Steele: Seasons Four & Five
