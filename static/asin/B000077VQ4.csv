All of the typical hits are here, nothing we haven't seen before. Although the band is in top form and everything sounds nice, it just gets boring and tiring because we've all seen this before (Like we haven't seen 'Got The Life' or 'Blind' performed three-dozen times already). This is pretty much an extended version of the special that aired on MTV over the summer. The concert itself was broadcast over the nation in certain theaters on June 10th, 2002 to celebrate the impending release of 'Untouchables.' It's worth a viewing, but as a Korn fan, I found that one time was more than enough.

Also the sound is just bad.  A lot of the guitars and stuff is just indistinguishable, I know Korn is capable of doing a lot better.  I guess I can give them a break considering they were just out of the recording studio when they filmed this, so they weren't quite warmed up to the live playing aspect.  But a lot of the sound problems occur in the eq'ing.  There are too many mid's, whoever engineered this should be shot because he did a bad job making the band sound their best.  It's a good effort, and I hope that Korn comes out with another live DVD showing their real talents.ROCK ON!",3,This DVD could be so much better,1069718400,"11 25, 2003",2003,784,"['think', 'having', 'two', 'discs', 'was', 'waste', 'space', 'second', 'disk', 'only', 'live', 'show', 'music', 'background', 'video', 'playing', 'not', 'multi-angle', 'option', 'dvd', 'Also', 'sound', 'just', 'bad', 'lot', 'guitars', 'stuff', 'just', 'indistinguishable', 'know', 'Korn', 'capable', 'doing', 'lot', 'better', 'guess', 'can', 'give', 'break', 'considering', 'were', 'just', 'recording', 'studio', 'when', 'filmed', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'warmed', 'up', 'live', 'playing', 'aspect', 'lot', 'sound', 'problems', 'occur', ""eq'ing"", 'are', 'too', 'many', 'mid', 'whoever', 'engineered', 'should', 'be', 'shot', 'did', 'bad', 'job', 'making', 'band', 'sound', 'best', 'good', 'effort', 'hope', 'Korn', 'out', 'live', 'DVD', 'showing', 'real', 'talents.ROCK', 'ON']",Live

Hagerman ""milkboydanny""","[0, 0]","i will start with the only drawback for this live DVD.  i found the filming to be choppy.  for example, the camera is on johnathon and then blink, move to head or fieldy or whatever.  blink move blink move repeat.  the camera never stayed still long enough for me to focus.  it was quite annoying and difficult to adjust to.  this is why i could not give this 5 stars.other than this it was pretty damn good.  i did not expect the korn &quot;sound&quot; to come across in the dvd as well as it did.  i have seen korn 2x live and they have this incredible sound  that is really awesome on record.  it is 1000x sweeter live.  i was bowled over to hear that sound pumping thru my speakers as i watched the dvd.  korn is not a fan to take lightly.  there is an incredible amount of energy on stage as well as with the fans.  this all expldoes live and this dvd captured that. they captured the frantic and frentic vibe quite well.the show itself was quite awesome and having been to the hammerstein (what a phenominal place to see a show) i can say that this dvd captured that amazing show and all it had to offer.  from the opening of &quot;Here to stay&quot; thru their cover of &quot;one&quot; to the end with &quot;got the life&quot; this is one amazing show and the dvd gets it all.as for the features, when this show was played live, the band was not only recording but broadcasting to select movie theatres throughout the U.S.  they document the band and its plans to take on such a venture.  it was pretty cool.  you see the band in a very different light.  they got pretty nasty with the crew.  there are some alternate angles from the show and some remixes that are freaky.  all in all a worthwhile venture.  i had to own this.",4,almost  perfect but not quite,1064793600,"09 29, 2003",2003,1733,"['i', 'will', 'start', 'only', 'drawback', 'live', 'DVD', 'i', 'found', 'filming', 'be', 'choppy', 'example', 'camera', 'johnathon', 'then', 'blink', 'move', 'head', 'fieldy', 'blink', 'move', 'blink', 'move', 'repeat', 'camera', 'never', 'stayed', 'still', 'long', 'enough', 'focus', 'was', 'quite', 'annoying', 'difficult', 'adjust', 'why', 'i', 'could', 'not', 'give', '5', 'stars.other', 'was', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'korn', 'quot', 'sound', 'quot', 'come', 'dvd', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'korn', '2x', 'live', 'have', 'incredible', 'sound', 'really', 'awesome', 'record', '1000x', 'sweeter', 'live', 'i', 'was', 'bowled', 'hear', 'sound', 'pumping', 'thru', 'speakers', 'i', 'watched', 'dvd', 'korn', 'not', 'fan', 'take', 'lightly', 'incredible', 'amount', 'energy', 'stage', 'as', 'well', 'fans', 'expldoes', 'live', 'dvd', 'captured', 'captured', 'frantic', 'frentic', 'vibe', 'quite', 'show', 'was', 'quite', 'awesome', 'having', 'been', 'hammerstein', 'what', 'phenominal', 'place', 'see', 'show', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'dvd', 'captured', 'amazing', 'show', 'had', 'offer', 'opening', 'quot', 'Here', 'stay', 'quot', 'thru', 'cover', 'quot', 'one', 'quot', 'end', 'quot', 'got', 'life', 'quot', 'one', 'amazing', 'show', 'dvd', 'all.as', 'features', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'played', 'live', 'band', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'recording', 'broadcasting', 'select', 'movie', 'theatres', 'U.S.', 'document', 'band', 'plans', 'take', 'venture', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'see', 'band', 'very', 'different', 'light', 'got', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'crew', 'are', 'alternate', 'angles', 'show', 'remixes', 'are', 'freaky', 'worthwhile', 'venture', 'i', 'had', 'own']",Live

As I went through it, I noticed something very strange and familiar. Most of Korn's fans are kids. Mostly kids buy their cd's. Jonathan Davis always sings about crap that happened to him when he was a kid. I then turned off the DVD when to go for a walk and ponder my maturity. I think Korn needs to grow up. I mean, they still put out good material, but they need a new quality to appeal to. I have their self-titled album as well as Follow The Leader.

724531,A2L7JN8R6GQE0F,B000077VQ4,Gunther Haagendazs,"[4, 6]","This DVD Korn released was most likely a response to the low sales of Untouchables (their worst album, my opinion). But with that fact aside, let's look at what we have here.  Two DVDs, 15 songs, and parts of two other songs as Make me bad is combined with One and Justin (Justin isn't labeled on the back of the case and both are only segments of the whole songs.  Korn Should have played One in it's entirety as they were rushed yet again when they first performed it and therefore shortened it from 9 to 5 minutes.  Well that's just my opinion, but they do play the best part of the song (""Darkness, imprisoning me, all that I see, Absolute horror!"").  There are a few standouts in the concert but there is just something not right.  The director cuts and edits like crazy, sometimes finnaly frustrating you so much, you find yourself yelling at the TV.  This is evident mostly at the opener Here to Stay.  Several times he will cut to something for less then a second, thus you'll find yourself asking yet again ""what was the point of that cut?""Other then the editing job, the song selection is a problem.  They only Picked Twist and A.D.I.D.A.S. from Life is Peachy (My favorite Korn album), which disappointed me to no end.  Most of their songs are the ""light"" singles that receive all the airplay, ignoring other classics like Good God, Ball Tongue, Need To, Dead bodies Everywhere, Etc. But Korn's delivery is the top thing here that irritates me.  It's actually very boring most of the time.  Jon has clearly aged as he hardly moves around on stage at all anymore.  I have a film of them playing at Woodstock 99 and Jon is jumping around like crazy, moving all over the stage.  Here Jon has clearly lost the energy.  I don't blame them, they all have had kids by now and age has taken its toll.  This also shows throughout with the other band members as well, but it's most obvious with Jon.  As for the extras on disc 2, the alternate version is audio of the concert with just the giant screen that played behind them, showing disturbing pictures and the like.  Although interesting at first, one can hardly watch the concert like this all the way through.  The only thing worth while is the really, really short behind the scenes documentary.  They didn't include any other bonus material, no music videos, no Easter eggs, nothing.  Well if you have never seen Korn live before, this makes a great gift, but otherwise, you can skip this, there's nothing special about it, but then again there is nothing terrible either.

A buddy had an extra ticket, so I went.  I went to the show as an open-minded listener and left as a rabid fan!Ever since that concert (and the two other times I've seen them live since) I have wanted a DVD that captured the frenetic energy of the band in a concert setting.  Family Values DVD only gives a brief glimpse, while Deuce DVD focuses on behind the scenes footage and the band's music videos.Finally the band granted my wish and released &quot;KoRn Live&quot; DVD.  The live footage is taken from their CD release party performance at the Hammerstein Ballroom for the Untouchables disk.  This footage was broadcast to KoRn fans at various lucky movie theaters across the US.  Now all of us can see the concert in all its glory in this very professional looking and sounding concert.The energy of the band and crowd are really incredible.  The ballroom looks terrific, the stage looks amazing with the giant television theme, and the guys are really giving it their all.  You can tell it's their first concert in awhile since Jonathan Davis loses his voice towards the end of the show.  It's a testimony to how much effort these guys put in for the fans.There's a brief episode on the second disk showing &quot;the making of KoRn Live&quot; which will show you a totally new side of the band.  Wow!  There was some real friction between the bandmates and the director of the production!  You'll see the heated exchanges as the production crew and the band try to bring everything together before the curtain drops.

There is lots of songs on here, whether you liek their mainstream stuff, or their more obscure stuff, there is something for everyone on here, plenty of live performance, and as close as you can get without actually being there. I didnt give it 5 stars because their newest album is really amazing, and heavy.

724539,A389B5YYA5J8HE,B000077VQ4,"Stevo ""Future Oscar Winner""","[1, 2]","Korn is one of the best live bands I've ever seen.  I should know.  I've seen them FIVE different times in concert.  In 2002, on the eve of the release of ""Untouchables"", they played a sold out show at the Hammerstein ballroom in NYC.  What followed was a band that obviously hadn't played a live show in some time.Jonathan is overweight, out of shape, and seems (at that time) to be losing his hair.  He has to hold onto his microphone stand half of the time.  He has gotten into shape (and looks much better now), but in June of 2002 he looked as if he had one too many cheeseburgers.The rest of the band plays pretty subdued compared to other performances I've seen.  They have obvious difficulty on (then) new songs such as ""Blame"", ""Embrace"", and ""Thoughtless"".  Jonathan's vocals, especially when he has to sing high notes, really suffer.  I'm not trying to slam them or anything, but you can tell they needed to get some more touring under their belts to get the rust off.  The opening ""Here to Stay"" is the highlight, with everyone hitting on all cylinders on that one.The back of the case lists Metallica's ""One"" as er, one of the tracks (no pun intended).  However, while they do perform the song, they only play about one minute of it (the fast ""darkness, imprisoning me, all that I see...."" part) as part of a melody with ""Shoots and Ladders"" and ""Justin"".There is a 2nd disc, with a 10 minute or so feature on creating the lights/effects for the show.  Apparently they almost didn't pull it off, and if you watch the show, there is one major production screwup:  The curtain falls to reveal the band about 3 seconds too early.There is also the option of watching the background videos that play behind the band during the concert as a standalone.  It's a nice touch, but gets old real fast, unless you're planning on recreating the concert in your basement or something.Overall, I applaud the effort and am glad it was released, but it just doesn't hold up to other performances.  The ""Live on the Other Side"" DVD from 2006 (from the same venue) is miles better.",2,Not a good show.,1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,2075,"['Korn', 'one', 'best', 'live', 'bands', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'should', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'FIVE', 'different', 'times', 'concert', '2002', 'eve', 'release', 'Untouchables', 'played', 'sold', 'out', 'show', 'Hammerstein', 'ballroom', 'NYC', 'What', 'followed', 'was', 'band', 'obviously', 'had', ""n't"", 'played', 'live', 'show', 'time.Jonathan', 'overweight', 'shape', 'time', 'be', 'losing', 'hair', 'hold', 'microphone', 'stand', 'half', 'time', 'gotten', 'shape', 'much', 'better', 'now', 'June', '2002', 'looked', 'had', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'cheeseburgers.The', 'rest', 'band', 'pretty', 'subdued', 'compared', 'other', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'obvious', 'difficulty', 'then', 'new', 'songs', 'such', 'Blame', 'Embrace', 'Thoughtless', 'Jonathan', 'vocals', 'especially', 'when', 'sing', 'high', 'notes', 'really', 'suffer', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'slam', 'anything', 'can', 'tell', 'needed', 'get', 'more', 'touring', 'belts', 'get', 'rust', 'off', 'opening', 'Here', 'Stay', 'highlight', 'everyone', 'hitting', 'cylinders', 'back', 'case', 'Metallica', 'One', 'er', 'one', 'tracks', 'pun', 'intended', 'However', 'do', 'perform', 'song', 'only', 'play', 'one', 'minute', 'fast', 'darkness', 'imprisoning', 'see', 'part', 'part', 'melody', 'Shoots', 'Ladders', 'Justin', '2nd', 'disc', '10', 'minute', 'so', 'feature', 'creating', 'lights/effects', 'show', 'Apparently', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'watch', 'show', 'one', 'major', 'production', 'screwup', 'curtain', 'reveal', 'band', '3', 'seconds', 'too', 'early.There', 'also', 'option', 'watching', 'background', 'videos', 'play', 'band', 'concert', 'standalone', 'nice', 'touch', 'old', 'real', 'fast', ""'re"", 'planning', 'recreating', 'concert', 'basement', 'something.Overall', 'applaud', 'effort', 'am', 'glad', 'was', 'released', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'other', 'performances', 'Live', 'Other', 'Side', 'DVD', '2006', 'same', 'venue', 'miles', 'better']",Live
