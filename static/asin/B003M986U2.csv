When his conversation quickly gets to how he has nothing to do for the rest of his lunch hour, and he's very horny, one doesn't need to be psychic to figure where this is going. It does, but not the way you would expect.""Just Say Love"" (2009) is the screen adaptation of a play about loneliness and a unique perspective on relationships, whether they consider them acquaintances, friendships or love.  Guy and Doug start off clearly wanting very different things out of their meetings, but it evolves - over a period of many months - into something that is mutually rewarding and satisfying to both of them, but not in the way they first expected. It's a sweet (and perhaps a bit contrived) story, produced as it would be on a small stage, with minimal props, just the two characters (thankfully, played by skilled actors who do their best with the occasional eye-rolling dialogue), and some imagination needed in absence of tangible props (It took me a second to realize they were both admiring a ""painting"" that was just an empty frame.)  Not everyone's cup of herbal tea, but a welcome respite from the average gay love story.Produced by Here!TV, and likely to be on their service eventually, the film is unrated but would likely be an R.

1354158,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B003M986U2,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[1, 6]","This is a rather cold, low budget stage play which involves only two characters throughout. There is the part of a baby shown once but spoken of throughout the play, and a brief involvement of a man whose face you don't see and the brief appearance of a girlfriend spoken of throughout whose face you also never see. The rest of the play involves only the two characters, Guy, (Matthew Jaeger) a gay man who is lonely and looking for true love as he has always imagined it to be, while he mourns the death of his cat; and Doug (Robert Mammana) a straight man who is in a relationship that he feels is going nowhere. Doug is horny and looking for physical fulfillment, but underneath it all he is also looking for a way to reconcile a lost, unfulfilled love from his youth. The stage is mostly dark and utilizes spotlights for emphasis. The props are a bit weird as is the whole play. It is based on philosophical beliefs which are rather obscure and largely based on the writings of Plato. There is somewhat of a story but not really a good one and rather unbelievable. Everytime the stage would go dark I was left hoping the play was over and wouldn't drag out any longer. I bought it, so I was committed to watching it through to the end, but that part seemed as if it would never come. There were a few good messages throughout, but not many. Both actors done a good job portraying their characters. Robert Mammana is a very good looking man who's acting was rather good. Matthew Jaeger however is a rather unattractive man who overacted his part a bit too much. It was ok, but definitely nothing I would ever want to see again. There is a scene which revolves around a new imaginary cat which the viewer never sees. I was largely disappointed and unless you are a vegetarian, or a follower of Plato or other so-caled philosophers, you will probably find it as boring and strange as I did. I will rate it with three stars given that it wasn't bad as a stage play, as stage plays go. It is not a ""film"" or ""movie"" and really offers no real entertainment value. It is a ""play"" and I suppose is intended as an art form.

The construction worker is torn between the two and he can not really ever come to the conclusion if he is gay or not. I don't want to give too much away, so I will leave it there.I think this movie was pretty good in the fact that as one reviewer already noted, it has a plot, a deep subject matter, and yes most gay movies are mostly either too over the top, or its like they ran out of money and it just ends leaving the viewer saying ""what the hell happened"".

It is a lot like kabuki, the highly formal, highly stylized classical Japanese dance/drama. It is the most tightly scripted and choreographed movie I have ever seen: not one word, not one gesture by either character is spontaneous. It feels more like very expertly executed computer animation than like two human men falling in love.I think the basic problem is the Platonic philosophy that dominates and runs insistently through the whole play. That philosophy - that the body is only a shallow, essentially meaningless reflection of spiritual reality - is itself so cold and so formal that it practically demands a treatment like this.That is sad. This could have been touching and meaningful, but it ends up being just very well executed technique on the part of everyone involved: the director, actors, set designer, cinematographer, etc. Like kabuki, it is fascinating to watch, but the fascination is purely intellectual, just like Plato.

Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again).  Selection/purchase comes from finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters, and from your comments at major online DVD sales or review sites.  Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or oftener (see below starred *** area for a list......and some ""near-addictive"" as well).  Thanks for sticking with me so far.))Having seen years of gay film productions (particularly romances) on video tape, Laser and DVD, for me most have been crap (any disagreement?).  BUT....this one can take a proud and high position in the Top-12 of gay dramas.  Excellent writing/conversion to screen, great staging.......they're in here.  Still and all, it's Matthew Jaeger (Guy / Guido) and Robert Mammana (Doug) who breathe life into this work and into Us as we watch. Captivated and drawn into their simple lives, we see them become Us---you and me.  That's right, who out here wouldn't want a man of openness, raw needs, funniness......wouldn't ""physically"" want such a man as Doug?  Would anyone of us turn down a Guy's perceptiveness, depth of feeling, and indefinable ability to draw us out of ourselves?So in the end, this whole thing (this ""Just Say Love"") has fallen to and been carried on the shoulders of these two amazing actors---actors who didn't just learn lines....but who lived their parts.

The relationship begins as a one-time sexual encounter (is Doug curious or simply in need of a lunchtime sex fix?).  But over a period of months it blossoms into friendship and finally love.The script tends to be quite repetitive.  After all, how many times do we need to hear Guy mutter ""Just say love, just say love""?  At only 75 minutes the film seems to drag.  There is little in the way of action, but lots and lots of talk.  Along the way we are treated to liberal doses of Platonic philosophy and new age sensibilities.The abstract sets and stark lighting reflect the film's stage background, but actually work quite well.  Nonetheless, this one probably is more effective on the stage.Mammana is fine as the confused Doug, who starts out as a typical beer-guzzling, meat-eating male.  His performance is sweet and somehow vulnerable as he makes the transformation to sensitive, caring lover.  The real problem with this movie is the character of Guy, or perhaps the performance of Jaeger, who plays him as a prissy, whining, self-righteous neurotic.  He would fit right into a Woody Allen film, except he isn't funny, just annoying.

1354181,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B003M986U2,Tommy Dooley,"[4, 4]","This is an adaptation of the stage play and is directed by Bill Humphreys. He has taken the very brave move to play this straight (no pun intended), in that it is almost a straight filmatic version of the stage play. It is shot all in a blacked out sound stage with the various sets all in view to begin with.The basic plot is that Guy (Mathew Jaeger) is reading Plato on a park bench, when the sweaty carpenter Doug (Robert Mammana) comes up sits down to have his lunch with a gassy beer and starts a conversation. He then goes on to proposition him for some apr&egrave;s lunch oral exercise in the bushes. They do seem poles apart especially so as Doug admits to being married and having a baby on the way.The relationship develops and what at first springs from sexual desire eventually takes on something more meaningful. The strengths of this film are the inter play with the actors. They are comfortable together even when they are having to be awkward. The direction is minimal as are the sets, which means that they have to be even more engaging - and they really both are.The stage play sets act as an alienation device for the audience, in that you are constantly being reminded of the unreality of the situation - but that is exactly what happens in a play anyway. The stage devices are a bit off putting like eating when there is clearly no food in the bowl and the set echoes in places. However, there is a well done love scene that then lapses into arty shots that are also unrealistic. Let's face it after some man on man coital activities, you don't start doing naked catalogue poses - at least I don't. This though is an exploration of the psychology of love and all else is a part player. In that the film succeeds, it is not rushed and the tale is simple but engaging.If you are a fan of gay cinema then this take will be of interest to you, the ending may leave some feeling that Ms Blyton had a hand in the script, but it is just an ending to a new beginning and I did not mind when I watched it.
