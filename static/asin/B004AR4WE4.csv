I dont understand the reasoning behind this and I feel like it was a waste of time.

I watched this a lot when I was little and loved it, and there are several advantages that Caillou has over most children's educational programming:1. The storylines do not repeat themselves (unlike with a certain explorer with a talking purple backpack and an anthropomorphic monkey that I know), therefore making the series more enjoyable for children and parents to watch.2. Caillou teaches children about common situations and how to handle them.3. The animation is bright and colorful, making it more likely to attract viewers.Not to mention that this video is a collection of episodes from some of the older seasons, and therefore they are far better than the stiffly-animated newer ones, which bored me when I was younger. Also, this involves the puppet segments centered around the experiences of Caillou's toys and pet cat, which I think inspire imagination and are a personal favorite of mine! A lot of people dislike these segments because they feel that they distract from the plot of the episode, but I for one adore them and wish that they had been kept in for the later seasons also. If you have a young nursery schooler or tot at home, buy this immediately! They will love it.",4,Enchanted!,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,1311,"['Ignore', 'anyone', 'who', 'Caillou', 'not', 'good', 'cartoon', 'small', 'children', 'watch', 'poor', 'example', 'watched', 'lot', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'loved', 'are', 'several', 'advantages', 'Caillou', 'over', 'most', 'children', 'educational', 'programming:1', 'storylines', 'do', 'not', 'repeat', 'certain', 'explorer', 'talking', 'purple', 'backpack', 'anthropomorphic', 'monkey', 'know', 'therefore', 'making', 'series', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'children', 'parents', 'watch.2', 'Caillou', 'children', 'common', 'situations', 'how', 'handle', 'them.3', 'animation', 'bright', 'colorful', 'making', 'more', 'likely', 'attract', 'viewers.Not', 'mention', 'video', 'collection', 'episodes', 'older', 'seasons', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'stiffly-animated', 'newer', 'ones', 'bored', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'Also', 'puppet', 'segments', 'centered', 'experiences', 'Caillou', 'toys', 'pet', 'cat', 'think', 'inspire', 'imagination', 'are', 'personal', 'favorite', 'mine', 'lot', 'people', 'segments', 'feel', 'distract', 'plot', 'episode', 'one', 'adore', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'kept', 'later', 'seasons', 'also', 'have', 'young', 'nursery', 'schooler', 'tot', 'home', 'buy', 'immediately', 'will', 'love']",Caillou: The Best of Caillou: Caillou's Summer Vacation
