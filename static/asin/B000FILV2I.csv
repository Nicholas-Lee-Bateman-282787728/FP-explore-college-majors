Do not get me wrong as it was funny but just not as great as the first two.That said my one big grip with this one was it was dirty compared to the others.

Bill & Jeff were their usual hilarious selves, Larry was ok.. his voice sounded a little off but Ron, wow... did he even pack on the pounds!  I think all that drinking fattened him up and took away his ability to be funny.I thought this installment easily was up to the level of the rest of them, and that end bit with the photos was the funniest end bit of all of the shows.  Each of the guys' comedy was right on and had me laughing endlessly.  In this one, all four routines were well spaced and perfectly long enough to be fully satisfied, plus the material seemed very fresh and new. The finale was also absolutely hilarious in seeing old photos of the guys from years before. Some of them were obviously doctored by a computer, but the guys' reactions to them were great.

This is the third installment and its just as impressive as the previous two.  Bill Engvall (one of the funniest men alive) starts things off, and as he does best he takes jabs as family life since above all else Bill is a family man.  One of the funniest jokes has to do though with his first massage and his reaction to it...great laughs.  Ron White is up next, and as he does best he takes jabs at life with booze and loose women, except now that he's a married man the loose women part has been narrowed down to one woman.  His set though is still funny especially his take on the movie 'Grizzly Man' although he spoiled the ending!  Jeff Foxworthy is on top of his game, although if you ask me he's not as good as his open acts, and quite frankly neither is Larry, although Larry can succeed in getting a laugh out of you for just about anything (his stand up routine in full is histerical!)  The great thing about these Blue Collar DVD's is that each of the four men bring something different to the table, their comedy is all unique that it doesn't feel your hearing the same recycled jokes over and over and each has such different delivery everything feels fresh, from Bills almost girlish expressions to Larry's 'Git-er-Done' every line is bound to force a smile.

If this is the first time you have become acquainted with the gang, this will likely be a 5-star experience.  The bits are still funny, and the ""old pictures"" segment to close out the show is almost worth the price alone.2. However, if you have already viewed parts one and two in the series, then (for likely the first time) the material will begin to really feel stale.  ""Rides Again"" began the over-exposure, while this one only continues the process.  Without that great last segment, the entire show would have really felt musty.In terms of evaluating each individual comedian:Bill Engvall: A bright spot; really engaging stories that may be his best performance of the three.Ron White: A step back from ""Rides Again""; loses some of that biting wit/sarcasm that is his hallmark.Jeff Foxworthy: Spends WAY too much time on one rather uninteresting subject, and routine suffers as a result.Larry the Cable Guy: Same old, same old here as even big-draw Larry starts to get a bit derivative and sinks into out-and-out crudity a bit too much.Thus, your opinion of this third (and last) entry into the Blue Collar film series will likely be determined by your previous forays into the series.
