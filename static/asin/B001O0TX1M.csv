But I grew up in a very rural part of the south where tvs were rare and tv stations were even rarer if you can imagine that.  So when I saw one of the movies on tv it was like christmas all over again (imagine that seeing something made you so happy even if you didn't get to keep it).  Later on as an adult I realised and even wrote a letter to renowned world famous and I think he should have gotten a medal from congress or the president for all the wonderfulness his characters did in this world, for adults and children alike. Much to my suprise and amazement, the author and creator himself wrote me back a letter I cherish to these days.  I am the parent of special needs children and even on their best day its so hard to explain things, but they absolutely adored watching any snoopy or peanuts book or movie I can get my hands on for them.  It isn't filled with tons of unwanted over abused advertised, violent or bad humor and unwanted grief like alot of cartoons are these days.  Good wholesome family values they have.  They also explain where some dogs and animals we end up with as pets, that there are people out there that care and just don't give animals to anyone but actually look for good homes for them.  Others help others and sometimes you learn by trial and error but that is okay, its absolutely wonderful and it deals with alot of issues basic ones that kids deal with even to this day but it shows that no matter what, Charlie Brown doesn't give up.. and Snoopy irregardless of how far out his family members are spread out in the world.  They always remember and love each other irregardless. so thank you amazon for making more of these avalible to the general public.",5,"these are absolutely wonderful for anyone birth to a 100, disabled or not, its a true treasure for everyone",1253664000,"09 23, 2009",2009,1807,"['have', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'peanuts', 'gang', 'charlie', 'brown', 'snoopy', 'everythng', 'everyone', 'included', 'grew', 'up', 'very', 'rural', 'part', 'south', 'where', 'tvs', 'were', 'rare', 'tv', 'stations', 'were', 'even', 'rarer', 'can', 'imagine', 'So', 'when', 'saw', 'one', 'movies', 'tv', 'was', 'christmas', 'over', 'again', 'imagine', 'seeing', 'something', 'made', 'so', 'happy', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'keep', 'Later', 'adult', 'realised', 'even', 'wrote', 'letter', 'renowned', 'world', 'famous', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'medal', 'congress', 'president', 'wonderfulness', 'characters', 'did', 'world', 'adults', 'children', 'alike', 'Much', 'suprise', 'amazement', 'author', 'creator', 'wrote', 'back', 'letter', 'cherish', 'days', 'am', 'parent', 'special', 'needs', 'children', 'even', 'best', 'day', 'so', 'hard', 'explain', 'things', 'absolutely', 'adored', 'watching', 'snoopy', 'peanuts', 'book', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'hands', ""n't"", 'filled', 'tons', 'unwanted', 'abused', 'advertised', 'violent', 'bad', 'humor', 'unwanted', 'grief', 'alot', 'cartoons', 'are', 'days', 'Good', 'wholesome', 'family', 'values', 'have', 'also', 'explain', 'where', 'dogs', 'animals', 'end', 'up', 'pets', 'are', 'people', 'there', 'care', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'animals', 'anyone', 'actually', 'look', 'good', 'homes', 'Others', 'help', 'others', 'sometimes', 'learn', 'trial', 'error', 'okay', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'alot', 'issues', 'basic', 'ones', 'kids', 'deal', 'even', 'day', 'matter', 'what', 'Charlie', 'Brown', ""n't"", 'give', 'up..', 'Snoopy', 'irregardless', 'how', 'far', 'out', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'spread', 'out', 'world', 'always', 'remember', 'love', 'other', 'irregardless', 'so', 'thank', 'amazon', 'making', 'more', 'avalible', 'general', 'public']",Snoopy's Reunion

(And just FYI, Snoopy's father appeared in a strip). It's a touching story describing the origins of the world's strangest beagle, including his time with Lila, the little girl from ""Snoopy Come Home"", though admittedly, this also sets up a contradiction with Charlie Brown's backstory as described in that film. Only two of the siblings never appeared in the strip, and here's the chance to finally see them all!Also included is ""It's FlashBeagle, Charlie Brown"", a personal favorite of mine, as I loved dancing when I was young. The picture quality was somewhat better than a VHS copy, but one thing that disappoints me is that they removed the 'music video' effects that were in this special when it aired on TV - such as spinning the frame around, freeze-framing Snoopy as he danced in five mini-screens, and pixelating him in the classroom.

1221452,APM06HT7JIPZ5,B001O0TX1M,"Erik Morton ""Erik Morton""","[3, 7]","SNOOPY'S REUNION:  (*Minor Spoilers*) This one was a major disappointment.  I've always loved it whenever Snoopy's relatives made appearances in the strip; Spike by far gets the most attention, but I also love Olaf, Andy, Marbles et al.  (Olaf was always my personal favorite: ""I'm not fat. I'm roly-poly."")  This episode is one lousy ""reunion.""  Once they do all get together, it lasts for all of four or five minutes, and all they do is jam with their musical instruments.  What this special SHOULD have done is increase its running time by at least 10 minutes, and allowed time for Snoopy's brothers and sisters to really interract with each other.  As it is, we never get to know any of them, and they are all bereft of any personality at all.  One day after watching it, I can think of three times I laughed and/or really enjoyed this show.IT'S FLASHBEAGLE, CHARLIE BROWN:  My reaction to this one was ""WHAT THE-?""  I almost always find it lame when the Peanuts characters sing songs, but it CAN work (it's handled very well in ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"").  It doesn't here.  At all.  The songs are excrutiatingly bad.  And I think it's a very rare thing when Peanuts actually manages to truly date itself, and this one obviously does.  From what plot there is, the centerpiece is Snoopy all decked out in 80s fashion, and dancing on a disco-style dance floor.  It's certainly to the creators' credit that they tried something new here, but it wasn't entertaining at all, and more often than not cringe-worthy.  But, on the total flip side, there are some parts in this episode that are CLASSIC Peanuts all the way, especially the opening with Peppermint Patty and Marcie in class the classroom.  It's a wonderful scene, and I found myself rewinding this section several times.  Plus, Lucy and Sally both have some great lines throughout.  (I particularly enjoyed Lucy's ""You know, Charlie Brown, you really have to do something about your face."")As for the disc, this is the first of Warner's Deluxe Editions that comes without a making-of featurette, but what we do get is pretty cool: a short piece featuring several of the Peanuts voice actors from across the years discussing their history with Peanuts, where they are now, how they got cast, etc.  Unfortunately, it's a bit on the fluffy side (as all these Deluxe Edition special features have been), barely ten minutes long.  But it's still a very nice bonus.""Flashbeagle"" seems like a personal favorite of many who grew up with it in the 80s, and that's more than understandable, and more power to them.  But for me, both of the specials contained on this disc were pretty lackluster.",3,"Really Minor Specials . . .

I can now knock these two off my list.  They were mildly entertaining, but not nearly as good as the classics.Up first is ""Snoopy's Reunion.""  It focuses almost entirely on Snoopy as we see his early family home and watch his short adoption by Lila before Charlie Brown goes to buy him.  After four years, Charlie Brown decides to get Snoopy's seven brothers and sisters together for a family reunion.  There are some fun instrumental numbers here, but there really isn't much of a story, and what is here contradicts earlier stuff like SNOOPY, COME HOME.  I didn't really get into Peanuts until the 80's, but I knew enough to know there were problems here.  Heck, four years pass, but Charlie Brown and Sally don't age.  Also interesting are three adults with real speaking parts.Next comes ""It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown.""  It's pure 80's pop soundtrack is fun, but there is even less of a story than normal.  It's got a few unrelated scenes strung together by nothing.  Having said that, the scenes with Peppermint Patty and Marcie in school (and that binder) were pretty funny.  And the ""Lucy Says"" song was also great.  But the extended scene of Snoopy dancing got old quickly.There's also a featurette with snippets of interviews with the now grown actors who have provided the voices for these characters over the years.  At just under 10 minutes, it was interesting, but I would have loved lots more information.Ultimately, only die hard Peanuts fans will love this disc.

I don't think one could ask for much more from a 25 minute cartoon than that.  &#34;Snoopy's Reunion&#34; is my favorite of the two presentations featured on this DVD.  It is really fun and contains some classic Snoopy moments such as Charlie Brown building Snoopy's dog house and loading the inside with straw for him to sleep in only to find that Snoopy chooses to sleep on top, and Snoopy donning his World War I Flying Ace cap, goggles, and scarf and firing up the trusty Sopwith Camel in order to fly all his relatives home again after their reunion and musical jam.

Mular,"[4, 9]","I almost gave this only 3 stars as these are not quite like the classics of the 1960's, but they are still more enjoyable than some of the later Peanuts Specials.And lets face it, this is only a 50 minute DVD (not counting bonus material).  If any other company tried to sell us a DVD under an hour long for $19.99 we would be shouting GREED.  We should get at least 4 Peanuts specials per DVD, if not 6 like most TV shows on DVD.SNOOPY'S REUNION has one main problem, the adults talk. The tradition of Peanuts in both the comic strip & the TV specials was that adult voices did not speak words.  But this TV special breaks with that tradition, and it shouldn't have.  It was not necessary to hear the words the farmer of the Daisy Hill Puppy farm said, the message would have gotten across with a muted horn.  There is also the sadness of Snoopy's family seperation in this TV special.  I'm more used to the happy-go-lucky Snoopy.FLASHBEAGLE has long been available on both VHS & Laserdisc (just like Snoopy's Reunion), I wish Warner would focus on titles never released on Laserdisc.  Flashbeagle has not dated well, it requires a viewing of the movie Flashdance to understand some of the references.  The Disco theme also helps make this out of date.  That is why it has not been seen much on TV.  It is still a decent musical special, but it lacks the classic Peanuts feel.",4,The adults talk!

I've looked everywhere for that one. It's been hard to find, except perhaps for a download for iPod from iTunes, and it's always been pricey on VHS. But now, it's included with this dvd. For those of you who don't know what the special is about, it's kind of a take on the Flashdance movie of the 80's, when that style of music and dance was popular. Lots of music in this one!Also, Snoopy's Reunion gives us a rare look at Snoopy's brothers and his sister, who weren't really seen too much in the comic strips. Out of all the siblings, Spike was the one mostly shown either writing to Snoopy or visiting him. So it's nice to see all of his relatives in one place. These two specials were not aired much during their time, perhaps once or twice. I saw them both once, and it's great that they've finally come back on dvd.

With SNOOPY'S REUNION, America's favorite beagle gets a DVD focusing on him.  The DVD features two Peanuts specials.  The first is SNOOPY'S REUNION.  This special first aired on television in 1991.  The special begins at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm with the birth of a litter of eight beagles.  As the beagles grow a bit, they begin playing instruments and form a family band.  Eventually each of the puppies are bought and adopted, but one, Snoopy, has to be returned by the girl who bought him.  The farmer places and ad in the paper and Charlie Brown takes Linus with him and buys the dog.  Snoopy is the best dog in the world, but there are times that he seems very lonely and Charlie and Sally Brown decide to get all of Snoopy's brothers and sisters together for a family reunion at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm.I love Snoopy's siblings.  Some of my favorite Peanuts strips were ones when Spike or Olaf came to visit Snoopy.  Unfortunately, the family reunion in SNOOPY'S REUNION doesn't last very long. It would have been nice to see them all playing together longer than they did. It would have also been nice to see how each of the siblings were doing and reveal what each of their lives are like; there's a montage for Snoopy, but there should have been one for each of his siblings. Also, SNOOPY'S REUNION contradicts events in the movie SNOOPY, COME HOME.  For instance, in that movie Charlie Brown tells Linus that when he was younger a kid poured a bucket of sand over his head and the next day his parents took him to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm to get him a dog. In this special, Charlie Brown goes with Linus to buy the dog from the puppy farm himself.The second special featured on the DVD is IT'S FLASHBEAGLE, CHARLIE BROWN.  I haven't seen all the Peanuts specials, but of all the ones I've watched, this has to be one of the strangest.  There isn't always an overall plot structure in Peanuts specials and they tend to jump around from one scene to another.  That's the case, here, too but instead of just a funny scene the special jumps from one crazy song to the next.  ""I'm In Shape"", ""Lucy Says"", ""Pig Pen Hoedown"", and ""Flashbeagle"" are the songs featured and the special parodies both SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER and FLASHDANCE.  Usually, Peanuts specials are timeless and aren't easy to date.  In fact, all of the previous Peanuts specials I've seen before have aged quite well. IT'S FLASHBEAGLE, CHARLIE BROWN does not.The only other special on the DVD is the featurette ""Together Again: A Peanuts Voice-Cast Reunion"". This featurette is about eight minutes long and brings together the voices of most of the characters from the very first Peanuts tv special and a few other people who played roles later on.  These former child voice actors were brought together during the 2008 Comic Con festival in San Diego.The SNOOPY'S REUNION DVD is kind of a hodge-podge.  I enjoyed SNOOPY'S REUNION, but found it too short.  IT'S FLASHBEAGLE, CHARLIE BROWN was kind of bizarre, but I know there are several Peanuts fans who list this Peanuts oddity as their favorite Peanuts special of all time. If you're a major Peanuts fan, you'll probably want to get this DVD, but if you're more of a minor fan, this is a DVD you will probably want to rent instead.",3,"Rare Specials, But They Lack the Classic Touch",1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,3363,"['Peanut', 'DVDs', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'released', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'mainly', 'focused', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'SNOOPY', 'REUNION', 'America', 'favorite', 'beagle', 'DVD', 'focusing', 'DVD', 'two', 'Peanuts', 'specials', 'first', 'SNOOPY', 'REUNION', 'special', 'first', 'aired', 'television', '1991', 'special', 'begins', 'Daisy', 'Hill', 'Puppy', 'Farm', 'birth', 'litter', 'eight', 'beagles', 'beagles', 'grow', 'bit', 'begin', 'playing', 'instruments', 'form', 'family', 'band', 'Eventually', 'puppies', 'are', 'bought', 'adopted', 'one', 'Snoopy', 'be', 'returned', 'girl', 'who', 'bought', 'farmer', 'places', 'ad', 'paper', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Linus', 'dog', 'Snoopy', 'best', 'dog', 'world', 'are', 'times', 'very', 'lonely', 'Charlie', 'Sally', 'Brown', 'decide', 'get', 'Snoopy', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'together', 'family', 'reunion', 'Daisy', 'Hill', 'Puppy', 'Farm.I', 'love', 'Snoopy', 'siblings', 'favorite', 'Peanuts', 'strips', 'were', 'ones', 'when', 'Spike', 'Olaf', 'came', 'visit', 'Snoopy', 'Unfortunately', 'family', 'reunion', 'SNOOPY', 'REUNION', ""n't"", 'last', 'very', 'long', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'playing', 'together', 'longer', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'how', 'siblings', 'were', 'doing', 'reveal', 'what', 'lives', 'are', 'montage', 'Snoopy', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'siblings', 'Also', 'SNOOPY', 'REUNION', 'events', 'movie', 'SNOOPY', 'COME', 'HOME', 'instance', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Linus', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'kid', 'poured', 'bucket', 'sand', 'head', 'next', 'day', 'parents', 'took', 'Daisy', 'Hill', 'Puppy', 'Farm', 'get', 'dog', 'special', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Linus', 'buy', 'dog', 'puppy', 'farm', 'himself.The', 'second', 'special', 'featured', 'DVD', 'IT', 'FLASHBEAGLE', 'CHARLIE', 'BROWN', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Peanuts', 'specials', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'be', 'one', 'strangest', ""n't"", 'always', 'overall', 'plot', 'structure', 'Peanuts', 'specials', 'tend', 'jump', 'one', 'scene', 'case', 'here', 'too', 'instead', 'just', 'funny', 'scene', 'special', 'jumps', 'one', 'crazy', 'song', 'next', ""'m"", 'Shape', 'Lucy', 'Says', 'Pig', 'Pen', 'Hoedown', 'Flashbeagle', 'are', 'songs', 'featured', 'special', 'parodies', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'FEVER', 'FLASHDANCE', 'Usually', 'Peanuts', 'specials', 'are', 'timeless', 'are', ""n't"", 'easy', 'date', 'fact', 'previous', 'Peanuts', 'specials', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'have', 'aged', 'quite', 'well', 'IT', 'FLASHBEAGLE', 'CHARLIE', 'BROWN', 'not.The', 'only', 'other', 'special', 'DVD', 'featurette', 'Together', 'Again', 'Peanuts', 'Voice-Cast', 'Reunion', 'featurette', 'eight', 'minutes', 'long', 'together', 'voices', 'most', 'characters', 'very', 'first', 'Peanuts', 'tv', 'special', 'few', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'played', 'roles', 'later', 'former', 'child', 'voice', 'actors', 'were', 'brought', 'together', '2008', 'Comic', 'Con', 'festival', 'San', 'Diego.The', 'SNOOPY', 'REUNION', 'DVD', 'kind', 'hodge-podge', 'enjoyed', 'SNOOPY', 'REUNION', 'found', 'too', 'short', 'IT', 'FLASHBEAGLE', 'CHARLIE', 'BROWN', 'was', 'kind', 'bizarre', 'know', 'are', 'several', 'Peanuts', 'fans', 'who', 'list', 'Peanuts', 'oddity', 'favorite', 'Peanuts', 'special', 'time', ""'re"", 'major', 'Peanuts', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'get', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'more', 'minor', 'fan', 'DVD', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'rent', 'instead']",Snoopy's Reunion
