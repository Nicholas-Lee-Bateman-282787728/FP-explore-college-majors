They contain the audio commentaries by the producers the writers and the voice actors and they are a great time. It adds a whole new dimension to re-watching episode you watched in the past. Something you definitely want to dive into it you haven't yet. I mean it's something that is worth buying all the previous seasons just to enjoy these commentaries.I want to say that season eight wasn't the greatest season of Futurama ever but there are memorable quotes and great episodes.

This was a great season that had some fantastic episodes, including the unforgettable finale, which was every bit as touching and soulful as I was hoping. Along the way we saw Bender realize his dream of becoming a folk singer, Zoidberg found love, the Planet Express crew learned to work together, and Fry and Leela finally found what they were looking for together. You can't ask for more than that.The packaging and special features are typical of what you would expect at this point.
