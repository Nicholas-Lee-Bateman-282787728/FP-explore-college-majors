1644491,A2BSZPRBKYAB2K,B00C888OFA,"Joe Owen ""Joe""","[10, 10]",This outstanding documentary was originally aired on PBS and is the first in a series of documentaries about famous and historic palaces throughout Great Britain. Hampton Court was the primary home of Henry VIII from the time he was a young King until his death. Historians in the documentary tell a fascinating history of Henry and his unfortunate wives for whom some were beheaded due to the King getting bored and wanting a new wife. Hampton Court was later an unhappy palace of King George III's parents and later George III was the last monarch to live in the palace. The palace is a national treasure and a beautiful one at that. No expense was spared in Henry VIII building it and it shows. This documentary is filmed wonderfully and truly highlights this interesting palace and the commentaries by historians of Henry VIII and Tudor England and British History make this even more interesting!

It was a guided tour and it was great.  HOWEVER, I wish I had seen this first!  This excellent 60-minute history and ""tour"" of the castle and its grounds gave so much more history and secrets, if you will, than I learned actually being there. For me, the main draw of the place is the cache of Henry VIII and Cardinal Woolsey.  To walk on surfaces that they trod literally took my breath away.  Nevertheless, so many of the fascinating tidbits in this documentary were left out during my visit.Whether you have been, plan to go (a MUST before your trip) or daydream about going to Hampton Court, this dvd will give you lots of information and glorious images.What I wouldn't give to go back, look up and see the handcarved ""eavesdroppers"" in the rafters!

You will learn that the word &#34;eavesdrop&#34; was invented her and see the original eavesdroppers.

Technology will show you how tapestries from the 1500's here really looked in their original hues.  You'll see one of the few remaining 16th century kitchens.

1644496,A36RM2S7UD5K2R,B00C888OFA,"R. Whitney ""Ross Whitney""","[5, 7]","I expected, in ordering this video, to see a reasonable sampling of the various rooms in this massive palatial structure. Having seen it, I'd estimate that perhaps a dozen rooms are visited, and none of them are really explored. It's as if the filmmakers were told to stand behind the velvet ropes with the tourists. Some of the great halls are shown, but the camera seems to be locked down at one end of the room, with the lens repeatedly tilted upward and downward, or panned, to provide an overview of ceilings, walls and floors, mostly from a distance. There is no footage to indicate the complexity of interior architecture. And the same views of external facades are repeated again and again, as if the film producers were highly restricted, outdoors as well as indoors, as to where they could set up their cameras.Henry's troubled relationships with his wives, all of whom occupied Hampton Court, is lightly touched upon. For an hour-long production, this one contains far too little of substance. The potentials for a fine documentary on this subject would seem very large indeed. But without filmmaker access to at least some of the intricacies of the grand structures, they are not realized. The viewer is left with the impression that the entire program could have been filmed by a tourist who had rented a good video camera.For an extremely fine presentation on a related subject, buy the 2012 BBC production, ""The Queen's Palaces,"" in which the royal family gave filmmakers far greater access to several famous palaces. I've watched it multiple times, and I'll watch it again.
