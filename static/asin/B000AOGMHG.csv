Books and the pamphlet included in this DVD goes to great length to describe the various versions of the opera and its various cuts to the point that it confuses you even more. The plot is based on historic characters, but the plot is not a representation of actual history.  The resulting plot, what you watch on this production is not the best dramatic result, so some background on the history is advised before watching the opera. But the real value is the music and the portraying of human emotions into music. Case in point is King Phillip's II (Furlanetto)  reflection aria in act IV.  In addition, there are many duets with almost any combination of voices you can imagine. The real joy of the opera is its music. Singers are good, in particular Furlanetto and Keenlyside (Pose). Audio recording is good, although not exceptional.The production is very effective, except the scene in act II around Carlos V tomb. It is too dark for an image on the TV.Overall, recommended as long as you do some reading before watching it.",4,Worth watching,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,1064,"['Don', 'Carlo', 'history', 'Books', 'pamphlet', 'included', 'DVD', 'great', 'length', 'describe', 'various', 'versions', 'opera', 'various', 'cuts', 'point', 'even', 'more', 'plot', 'based', 'historic', 'characters', 'plot', 'not', 'representation', 'actual', 'history', 'resulting', 'plot', 'what', 'watch', 'production', 'not', 'best', 'dramatic', 'result', 'background', 'history', 'advised', 'watching', 'opera', 'real', 'value', 'music', 'portraying', 'human', 'emotions', 'music', 'Case', 'point', 'King', 'Phillip', 'II', 'Furlanetto', 'reflection', 'aria', 'act', 'IV', 'addition', 'are', 'many', 'duets', 'almost', 'combination', 'voices', 'can', 'imagine', 'real', 'joy', 'opera', 'music', 'Singers', 'are', 'good', 'particular', 'Furlanetto', 'Keenlyside', 'Pose', 'Audio', 'recording', 'good', 'not', 'exceptional.The', 'production', 'very', 'effective', 'scene', 'act', 'II', 'Carlos', 'V', 'tomb', 'too', 'dark', 'image', 'TV.Overall', 'recommended', 'as', 'long', 'do', 'reading', 'watching']",N/A

930055,A2NHPOAUX5YOJT,B000AOGMHG,Chilean Opera lover,"[6, 11]","I agree with many of the reviewers about the singing. All are correct except Amanda Roocroft. If she does not take care choosing apropriate roles for her voice like her outstanding Fiordiligi (the best that I have heard and seen, and the best Cosi available), she will not last too much time singing. Villaz&oacute;n is good but not as I expected. His tendency to shout the high notes makes unpleasant to listen and watch. In those moments his face almost turns red and looks strained. Dwayne Croft sings and acts great and convincing, the same as Robert Lloyd. I missed as other reviewers a darker chest voice for Eboli, like Shirley Verret, Florence Quivar, Grace Bumbry, Agnes Baltsa or Giulietta Simionato among others. But anyway Violeta Urmana did a good and convincing job.The worse for me, and mostly for that the two stars, is the sound of the DVD. I have listened it in a DTS 5.1 music system, but at moments the voices are hardly heard. Maybe the microphones were not in the correct places because, specially when the singers are back on the stage and the orchestra is playing full, is difficult to listen their voices. With DTS 5.1 as the singers move on the stage normally their voices move too from one speaker to another but this is not noticeable here. Really disappointing sound. If I could, I would have sent back the DVD and ask for a refund. Hopefully soon we will have a new Villazon's Don Carlo with a better sound and a better Elisabetta. Why not Netrebko? Her voice permits her to sing what she wants. Patience and hope.",2,SOUND  ?????????????

930056,ANJFW8DZ4ZCNK,B000AOGMHG,DDD,"[36, 47]","I opened my set and put it in the DVD player with great anticipation although I admittedly was prepared for a bit of disappointment when I found out that Kaufmann was not to be the Carlos but the Villazon. Even so with memories of Pappano's great performance with the Chatelet forces this would surely be a superb evening in the theatre.Alas, for me it was not so and on so many different levels I experienced disappointment. This production replaced the Visconti upon which an immense amount of praise had been lavished. It (the new production)is co-owned by the Met, ROH and the Norwegian Opera. I found the production unrealized and lacking in any sense of grandeur. At times it looked cheap and never evocative of the Spanish setting. The Bondy production was minimalist but one always had a sense of where you were. I wonder how Met audiences will respond?Then there was the textual consideration. So much music has been discovered in the last thirty years and to ignore it seems to me to be wilful on the part of the powers that be especially since Pappano particiapated in the Chatelet production. True the Chatelet omitted the opening chorus which even the Met now includes, but why was the Act IV duet between Carlos and Fillipo omitted? The music is glorious and appropriate. So what we have is the version which has been standard for LP recordings. To hear all the music, sung in the right language one has to buy the Vienna/Konwitschny edition which includes every last note in a production which will offend many. The situation is not unlike Boris in which the musical director should decide what is to be omitted and what should be included. Don Carlos is a long opera and I have no love for the inclusion of the ballet which is ordinarily omitted. The Auto-da-Fe scene in the Vienna version is audacious and not particularly dramatic. The ROH version is also rendered less effective, although traditional, because of the inclusion of spoken dialogue on the part of the priest when he addresses the heretics. Whose idea was this?And the singing? Villazon's Carlos was a very mixed bag. In the last few years tenors whose credentials have not included the word ""spinto"" have included this role on their CV. Alagna was subject to all kinds of criticism about making a foolhardy choice. He proved them wrong. His Carlos remains amoung the very best. Ramon Vargas in Vienna is another lyric who was canny enough to avoid the pitfalls of the role and come out a winner. Louis Lima another lyric apparently has not had a similar success. Villazon's vocal troubles are sufficiently documented not to be repeated here but he is clearly a weak link in a variable cast. he is not without imagination but Carlos is a long role, and while he has only one aria he is a major participant throughout the opera. Frequently he sounds at the end of his tether; there was a reason he did not return for the revival. The charismatic Keenlyside frequently seemed abstracted; one only has to compare his work with Hampton in the Chatelet production where he was involved and committed. Poplavskaya had been criticized for portraying the ""ice princess"", for having insufficient vocal thrust, for not being a spinto. Some of this is not without merit, but the role is a difficult one. When Milanov turned it down she was wise; afterall the aria comes in the last act; in the meantime she has to be a member of an ensemble in duets trios and quartets. Elizabeth's emotions are frozen since she is forced not to marry the man she loves but his father. A certain hauteur is required. My only criticism as regards the singing on these discs is her failure to sing any consonants so that much of the text is a vocalese--a beautiful one (exquisite pianos and pianissimos)but a vocalese nonetheless. Ganassi is another mezzo who stubs her toe in the role of Eboli. For a mezzo who has sung a great deal of Rossini one would think that her Veil Song would be a walk in the park. Well, it was better than Meir (Chatelet) but the small notes were barely articulated and the whole thing sounds effortful. O don fatale was somewhat better but her performance was essentially provincial. As an admirer of Robert Lloyd I am reluctant to comment. At 68 his vocalism  is not steady and his contribution only added to my overall disappointment. True, the role is small, but that is a specious argument.This is one of the few DVD's where I feel that I have been let down by the photography. I will admit that one of the many pleasures of watching a DVD are the closeups of the singers. I would be the first to admit that this is not the way one sees opera in the house. Well, I am not watching in the house but in my living room and the advantage of the closeup is exciting. The medium is visual and most producers and directors and the individuals making the decisions realize that. Here we have very few closeups and many medium and distant shots and to a certain extent I felt cheated.My last comment is one that will be of little import to most, but I must voice it: Don Carlos is a French opera; Verdi did not participate in the Italian translation. Surely the Chatelet production made that evident. Of course having two Francophone singers in leading roles and a baritone whose French is idiomatic were major pluses. The soprano may be a Finn but her French was more than exemplary. In the end this DVD continues to remain at the top and not without good reason. The singing, the style and the production all put it at the lead. This is not to say that there could be an Italian version equally as effective, but it will take a different kind of effort than the one offered by ROH.",3,Hopes Dashed,1286323200,"10 6,

Firstly Chailly's conducting is superb and the very sound of his orchestra is outstanding.  Secondly the production in effect translates the opera into a two act affair with disk one playing nonstop through Act 2, scene 2 and disk two doing the same for the rest of the opera.  This works quite well for home viewing.  Thirdly the acting, singing, and movement all highlight the drama and tensions of this opera and keep one involved with what is going on with the characters.  I was particularly impressed with Villazon, Croft, and Lloyd in this regard.  Needless to say I am quite happy to see Carlo played as an anguished adolescent.  And the sets and costumes?

Such a plethera of riches! This is a new opera for me as in the 40s, 50s, & 60s it was rarely done. Thus it has been most exciting over the last twenty to thirty five years to experience the rise in performances and the critical esteem of this longest of Verdi's ouvre. Having witnessed this deveopment and experiencing several productions at the Met and Lyric Chicago, I have grown more appreciative of this magnificent work and the various problems that are inherent in producing it. It has become my favorite Verdi and yet this monumental masterpiece is flawed and unwieldy because of its size and breadth. Schiller's poem drama of great length was itself a tirade against tyranny both secular and religeous. His was a Protestant point of view so the Catholic Church comes off not well but it was the Hapsburg tyranny that is the real villain in the play and in the opera. The opera has some of Verdi's most evocative music and the singers have to be the best and able to cope with the very strenuous vocal line. Just thinking of Furlanetto' Fillipo singing ""Ella giammai m'amo"" brings tears to my eyes. I've heard a line of great basses do this from Christoff and Ghiaurov to Van Dam and Miles but to my ears Furlanetto is Phillip II. The same is true with all the major roles. But lets get back to this DVD. The Hytner production at the ROH and subsequently seen broadcast from the Met live series is the one on this DVD. Some of the cast is different and I think the better for it. Overall I was most impressed by the Hytner concept. I must say that I was so involved in the intensity of the drama on stage that I didn't notice much of the scenery. It was fine by me and not obtrusive. I think it imperative to have all the Fountainbleau act be complete to fully understand why Elizabeth has to say yes to the marriage to Phillip even though she is in love with his son. The peasants plead with her. She has already  encountered them and be friended them and it they not the noble people in this production that cause her to say ""si"". The Don Carlo of Villazon is adequate but no match to the Met broadcast of Roberto Alagna. Alagna appears on the du Chatelet version with the Posa of Hampson, a great pairing. Alagna is the best Don Carlo of the present time. Marina Poplavskaya is the Elizabeth and the more often I hear her the better I think she is. She was on the Met broadcast and is of great depth but reserved and very royal. The best of the day. (Her ""Tu che le vanita"" cannot match the Freni of 1982, however). The Eboli (whatever became of the eyepatch?) of Gnassi is adquate but on the Met broadcast Anna Smirnova did a better job particularly ""Oh Don fatale"". Again no match for Grace Bumbry of 1982 Met production under Levine. Simon Keenlyside is one of the great finds in opera in recent times. His Hamlet made me respect the opera. Now his Posa is the standard to match. He is trained as a lieder singer and it shows in the care of his enuciation and the care of each syllable. I still think the Hampson Posa of the du Chatalet production was more involved and more beautiful of voice. But Simon's star is still rising. All in all the Hytner production on this disc, even with it minor flaws is a great source of pleasure and appriciation of this great masterpiece.

Lloyd occasionally sounded a little distant, particularly at the beginning of the big aria 'Ella giammai m'amo'', but it seemed to me that he was placed to far back in the stage and would have sounded better a little closer up.  Otherwise, he was a delight.  His acting was wonderful.Villazon was almost perfect.  I enjoyed his acting, perhaps even along with the stage direction.  He protrayed Don Carlo as a much weaker individual than the hero is generally protrayed and really, that seems to be the nature of the original real personality of Don Carlo. I found his acting realistic and very involved and his singing both beautiful and impassioned.Urmana was very good as Eboli, the one thing missing being the frightening chest voice you often hear in this role.  She has a solid chest voice, just not as exciting as one could wish for.  However, at the end of 'O Don Fatale', her high notes were so big and free, it was quite thrilling.

But the same backdrop is used for every scene, making no sense whatsoever.The costumes: The worst - all in a puritanical dark grey or light grey.  These are Spanish nobles and they are Catholic.  I felt like I was watching a story about Quakers.  Although they did take the felty-marbly-grey material and sew them into something like sixteenth-century fashion.  So the felty material did not hang appropriately and everyone had a huge rear end with Don Carlo appearing to wear a diaper.  Also, Amanda Roocroft, who is a young-looking, slim woman, looked fat (big felty butt) and old (dark and ugly makeup covering her pretty face).",3,Decent recording - terrible sets and costumes,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,2183,"['Lloyd', 'Villazon', 'are', 'winners', 'here', 'Lloyd', 'occasionally', 'sounded', 'little', 'distant', 'particularly', 'beginning', 'big', 'aria', 'giammai', ""m'amo"", 'seemed', 'was', 'placed', 'far', 'back', 'stage', 'would', 'have', 'sounded', 'better', 'little', 'closer', 'up', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'delight', 'acting', 'was', 'wonderful.Villazon', 'was', 'almost', 'perfect', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'perhaps', 'even', 'stage', 'direction', 'protrayed', 'Don', 'Carlo', 'much', 'weaker', 'individual', 'hero', 'generally', 'protrayed', 'really', 'be', 'nature', 'original', 'real', 'personality', 'Don', 'Carlo', 'found', 'acting', 'realistic', 'very', 'involved', 'singing', 'beautiful', 'impassioned.Urmana', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Eboli', 'one', 'thing', 'missing', 'being', 'frightening', 'chest', 'voice', 'often', 'hear', 'role', 'solid', 'chest', 'voice', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'exciting', 'one', 'could', 'wish', 'However', 'end', 'O', 'Don', 'Fatale', 'high', 'notes', 'were', 'so', 'big', 'free', 'was', 'quite', 'thrilling', 'could', 'tell', 'audience', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'made', 'up', 'lack', 'lower', 'range', 'Also', 'seemed', 'very', 'committed', 'role', 'dramatic', 'standpoint.Dwayne', 'Croft', 'very', 'pleasant', 'singing', 'decent', 'acting', 'said', 'there.The', 'Grand', 'Inquisitor', 'quite', 'acceptable.Amanda', 'Roocroft', 'worst', 'cast', 'principles', 'sounded', 'terribly', 'pushed', 'top', 'However', ""'Tu"", 'che', 'le', 'vanita', 'came', 'quite', 'nicely', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good.The', 'sets', 'Fake', 'marble', 'mausoleum-like', 'Very', 'nice', 'were', 'one', 'scene', 'so', 'like', 'maybe', 'two', 'church', 'scenes', 'same', 'backdrop', 'used', 'scene', 'making', 'sense', 'costumes', 'worst', 'puritanical', 'dark', 'grey', 'light', 'grey', 'are', 'Spanish', 'nobles', 'are', 'Catholic', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'story', 'Quakers', 'did', 'take', 'felty-marbly-grey', 'material', 'sew', 'something', 'sixteenth-century', 'fashion', 'felty', 'material', 'did', 'not', 'hang', 'appropriately', 'everyone', 'had', 'huge', 'rear', 'end', 'Don', 'Carlo', 'appearing', 'wear', 'diaper', 'Also', 'Amanda', 'Roocroft', 'who', 'young-looking', 'slim', 'woman', 'looked', 'fat', 'big', 'felty', 'butt', 'old', 'dark', 'ugly', 'makeup', 'covering', 'pretty', 'face']",N/A

The orchestral playing under Chailly is terrific. He is a superb Verdi conductor and his pacing and phrasing is unerring. In my opinion he is the star of the show. The singing and acting is generally very acceptable although Amanda Roocroft is somewhat lacking in vocal power. The recorded sound is warm and clear. The 4 act version is relatively short.The negatives: The production, cheaply devised in a dreary and opressive grey, leaves much to be desired. But compared to a lot of the more intrusive rubbish emanating from European opera houses nowadays, it could have been worse! Try concentrate on the music and stage action.

930062,A1LYAFTZNX2UCI,B000AOGMHG,Shelley,"[3, 3]","Winner of the 2011 Gramophone Award for best DVD - this Covent Garden performance of the five act Italian version of Verdi's ""Don Carlo"" is simply superb.This ""grandest of all grand operas"" has long been special to me since I first saw the recording of the iconic 1986 Salzburg performance conducted by Karajan, with Jos&eacute; Carreras in the title role.  That began a fascination with the historical Don Carlos - an enigmatic character of contradictions, if ever there was one!Rolando Villaz&oacute;n's intense Carlos brings out a myriad of colours - exuberance, devastation, hope, despair, and the simmering undercurrent of resentment and rebellion which is finally his undoing.  It is beautifully sung, and I especially love the Fontainebleu scene which is so often omitted from performances.  His first aria is magic!Marina Poplavskaya's voice is perhaps not as ""big"" as might be expected in the role of Elisabeth, but its crystal-like quality brings an air of deceptive fragility to the character, which belies her inner strength and defiance of the king.  Her transformation from eager girl to dignified queen is very realistic. Simon Keenlyside gives us a finely-sung Rodrigo. His calmness stands in marked contrast to the prince's volatility, and the unspoken bond of brotherhood between them shines through.The perennial Ferruccio Furlanetto has to be the definitive Philip of our generation.  He also played this role in the Salzburg performance mentioned above - and here he is, 25 years later, still delivering the same excellence of vocal and dramatic portrayal.  Eric Halfvarson's Grand Inquisitor is pure malevolence masquerading as piety, and the late night scene in Philip's chamber throbs with tension, mistrust and the powerful singing of two duelling basses!At first I was a little puzzled with the seeming lack of patent evil in Sonia Ganassi's Eboli, until I realised it was scorn, and not venom, that was her motivation.  This made sense when I thought of the real Eboli, married to a high-ranking Portuguese prince, perhaps considering the intrigues of court to be nothing more than a game - until she realised too late that she was playing with fire.The auto-da-f&eacute; scene is a show-stopper which left me with completely scrambled emotions.  On the one hand my heart lifted with Verdi's glorious music, while at the same time my stomach knotted with the visual horror of the burning victims.  The inclusion of spoken dialogue as a priest condemns the accused is unusual, but I believe it is historically accurate, and fits very well into the context.The ROH Orchestra under Antonio Pappano delivers musical excellence as always, and the sets and costumes of the Royal Opera are superb, evoking both the splendour and austerity of the age.  The San Yuste crypt with the Emperor's tomb is particularly striking.  Here, an ending which is always open to speculation and interpretation is given an interesting, realistic and valid twist.

930064,A27N0FKWUI2WFS,B000AOGMHG,Todd Kay,"[10, 10]","Sometimes we leave wondering why Verdi's opera was not titled PHILIPPE II, ROI D'ESPAGNE. On this occasion, however, we might feel it should have been called ELISABETH DE VALOIS, for the Queen is the most interesting and fully realized figure in stage director Nicholas Hytner's production (shared by the Met, Norwegian National Opera, and Royal Opera House Covent Garden; EMI's DVD is a composite of three summer 2008 ROH performances). Hytner and soprano Marina Poplavskaya have brought much care and imagination to the heroine's gradual progression from coltish, mischievous young girl to fatalistic, disillusioned monarch, and their work is persuasive. They make Elisabetta's every look, gesture, and attitude seem integral and supported by text and music, whether the choice is traditional or not (e.g. Elisabetta's helpless look back at Carlo as she is carried away in the celebratory procession at the close of Act I; the flash of anger aimed Filippo's way during the farewell to the banished Countess, a solo thankfully given its full two-verse due here; the sprinklings of pride and haughtiness amidst the protestations of innocence in Act IV Scene 1). Poplavskaya, as always, is a fascinating face to watch, and she looks show-stoppingly glamorous in a series of period gowns by Tony Award winner Bob Crowley. Even the changes in her coiffure from scene to scene tell us something of the character's inner life.If the voice that comes out when this sensitive actress opens her mouth is not the sort we think of as that belonging to a ""Verdi soprano"" in the classic line, it is an interesting one in its own right, and it is the one belonging to the woman attempting the part. With adjustment for vocal category, the same could be said of other cast members. Both Simon Keenlyside (Rodrigo) and Sonia Ganassi (Eboli) must work hard for the high notes to which their music frequently guides them; each sounds most comfortable in the midrange. Keenlyside's portrayal seems unfinished. It is difficult to know whether stray tics and mannerisms we see, little smirks and squints, a curious rigidity of posture at baseline, are the character's or his own. At the Met, with a different eponymous tenor (Roberto Alagna) opposite Keenlyside, Hytner seemed to me to have encouraged a subtext to the Carlo/Rodrigo relationship that probably had not occurred to Schiller, Verdi, or the librettists, but is increasingly fashionable in modern stagings. For example, Keenlyside obviously was playing barely concealed delight when Alagna's Carlo began to confide his ""sinful love,"" and when the object of the sinful love was revealed to be Carlo's stepmother and not Rodrigo himself, the baritone played disappointment along with the usual shock and revulsion. This is less obvious on the ROH DVD. Ganassi is a considerable improvement over the unfocused, pitch-indeterminate Anna Smirnova, who replaced her for the 2010-11 Met performances, but Ganassi is another in a long line of mezzo-sopranos who lack the flexibility for the Veil Song. Her native credentials serve her well in terms of both style and delivery of text, but her deportment works against the concept of a glamorous seductress of the royal court; she is less than an ideal foil for Poplavskaya's elegant Queen.Ferruccio Furlanetto has previously appeared on video as both the Grand Inquisitor (the 1983 Met/DG) and Filippo (the 1986 Karajan performance of the four-act abridgement, on Sony). Here, all that mars a powerful portrayal of the King is a tendency to depart from the sung line by shouting, modifying pitches, and cheating note values. I prefer to believe these are Furlanetto's crafty ways of working around narrowing resources, because if they are expressive choices, they stand out starkly against the greater portion of his contemplative work. Eric Halfvarson is also an old hand at the Grand Inquisitor (over a decade earlier, he appeared in the French-language Chtelet performance with the same conductor, also on DVD). At this point, so entrenched is the practice of casting basses who have the remnants of a voice as the Inquisitor, I no longer go in expecting to hear the musical line honestly, securely sung. This seems to have devolved into a character part, where stage presence, skill at declamation, and the ability to look and sound convincing as a 90-year-old relic are prized over absolute musical values. Within those strictures, Halfvarson does accomplished work. Robert Lloyd, having progressed in previous years through Filippo and the Inquisitor, completes his trifecta of this opera's bass roles by appearing as the Monk, and he is effective in the brief role.The major liability, sadly, is Rolando Villaz&oacute;n as Don Carlo himself. This ROH run occurred between his first and second withdrawals from the stage, before his vocal cord surgery, but no knowledge at all of his medical biography is required to hear that he was in serious trouble and would have been wiser to cancel. When the music lies low and the specified dynamic is undemanding, there are reminders of the fine instrument with which he first appeared on the international circuit; but the voice is dry and lacking in polish, core, and stability, and the resulting performance consistently strained. With three dates from which to compile, the makers of the DVD have kept out major calamities, but the tenor constantly sounds on the verge of cracking, and any listener who knows where the music of this long and difficult part is leading, what hurdles lie ahead, is likely to be kept on the edge of his/her seat in the wrong way. It is unfortunate that Jonas Kaufmann's assumption of the role in the ROH's subsequent revival was not chosen for preservation instead. Villaz&oacute;n's fans are better off with the earlier DVD of Willy Decker's Amsterdam DON CARLO (four acts, on Opus Arte). Here, he hobbles through with a likable personality and not much more.Antonio Pappano's conducting has matured since the previous Kultur DVD of an eccentric pick-a-mix edition (frequently misadvertised as ""the original French DON CARLOS""). The ROH Orchestra plays very well for him, and they are well recorded -- the high-quality audio and video are major pluses. Hytner's physical production has been controversial for its hard-edged, none-too-lavish scenic design (e.g. the bright-red ""Lego wall"" before which Eboli entertains the ladies of the court) and for the addition of an actor delivering spoken dialogue as a fanatical priest in the auto-da-f&eacute;, covering Verdi's cornet solo (ceremonial music frequently cut altogether, it is worth noting). But the director is alert to character possibilities, most successfully in the handling of the Queen but also in the central confrontation between Rodrigo and Filippo, the motivations, conflicts, and agendas of which emerge with force and precision (Keenlyside and Furlanetto are at their best in that duet too, and everyone benefits from Pappano's clarification of the musical development). Hytner also attempts with some success to unify this sprawling work by isolating Carlo at scene endings, ""orphaning"" him on the stage by lowering a wall behind him that hides everything and everyone else from view.My first choice DON CARLO/S DVD at the time of this writing (from a field encompassing both languages and several versions of the score) remains the first video of the opera released in any format, the Met 1983. This offers a generous performing edition (everything the ROH 2008 has, plus the rarely performed opening scene for Elisabetta and her war-deprived people), impressive orchestral playing under James Levine, John Dexter's evocative traditional production, and a cast including several great 20th-century singers in roles with which they were closely identified. Even if no one was having the best day of his or her life, they come out well ahead of most of the competition. The new ROH, more clearly a product of our present age in its state-of-the-art technical credits and its director's attention to matters of acting, is a respectable contender for the ""place"" position.",4,Tristezza,1311292800,"07 22, 2011",2011,8104,"['Sometimes', 'leave', 'wondering', 'why', 'Verdi', 'opera', 'was', 'not', 'titled', 'PHILIPPE', 'II', 'ROI', ""D'ESPAGNE"", 'occasion',

930065,A252DFK99C1YVS,B000AOGMHG,Toni Bernhard,"[20, 25]","This production is the four-act version of ""Don Carlo"" revised by Verdi in 1884. I must first admit that I prefer Verdi's original five-act version. When the original Act I is omitted, as it is here, we miss the one moment of happiness for Don Carlo and Elisabetta. In addition, too much background regarding the subsequent action is omitted - references are lost (e.g. Elisabetta's reference to Fontainebleau during her great last act aria) and the characters' motivations aren't always clear. But it is common to use Verdi's revised four-act version, so we must look at it on its own terms.I was looking forward to seeing Rolando Villazon as Don Carlo. As expected, his singing is superb. His voice is crisp and expressive, and he pays such careful attention to phrasing that every piece sounds fresh and new. But I was disappointed in Villazon's interpretation of the title character. I thought he took the same approach to Don Carlo that he did to Alfredo in the 2005 Salzburg production of ""La Traviata"" (hard to believe, the two characters being so utterly different in temperament and circumstance). But in both operas, Villazon's onstage demeanor is that of an immature and crazed adolescent, flailing around too much. I was hoping for a more nuanced performance from him as the troubled but complex Don Carlo. That said, the DVD is worth seeing just to hear Villazon sing.Amanda Roocroft, who was so sparkling as Fiordiligi in the Theatre du Chatalet's 1992 DVD of Mozart's ""Cosi Fan Tutte,"" struggles hard to meet the demands of Elisabetta. This role doesn't require the performer to be a ""dramatic soprano"" as is the case with many Verdi roles (Aida, for example); but the voice required for Elisabetta is heavier than that of a strictly ""lyric soprano."" The word ""spinto"" is often used for this ""in between"" quality of voice (""spinto"" meaning ""pushed"" in Italian), but of course, the skill is to ""push"" without sounding pushed. The voice must naturally sound lyrical but with considerable heft to it. Roocroft's attempts to meet the vocal requirements of the role sound harsh and strained throughout, especially when in the upper register. Perhaps she was having an off night (I don't know if the production was filmed over several nights or not).Violetta Urmana as Eboli was a disappointment. Not only does she not act the part of a femme fatale, she and the chorus are downright clunky in the Veil Song. With its flowing Castilian sound, this melodic piece should come as a breath of fresh air after the doom and gloom of the previous scenes (and of most of the subsequent ones!). Urmana fares better in O Don Fatale, as if she finally just lets her deep chest voice relax and show its stuff.The person who appears most at ease in his role is Dwayne Croft as Rodrigo. He has a beautiful lyrical baritone voice. His duets with Villazon are the highlight of the production. Robert Lloyd does a fine job as Philip II, even though, as others have noted, his voice has lost some of its power.Lastly, I was disappointed by the directorial choice to make Don Carlo's fate clear at the end. Irresolution is one of the themes of this opera from beginning to end. It's what Verdi and his librettist intended and I prefer that it be left that way.",3,Uneven performances; disappointing ending; still worth seeing,1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,3250,"['production', 'four-act', 'version', 'Don', 'Carlo', 'revised', 'Verdi', '1884', 'must', 'first', 'admit', 'prefer', 'Verdi', 'original', 'five-act', 'version', 'When', 'original', 'Act', 'omitted', 'here', 'miss', 'one', 'moment', 'happiness', 'Don', 'Carlo', 'Elisabetta', 'addition', 'too', 'much', 'regarding', 'subsequent', 'action', 'omitted', 'references', 'are', 'lost', 'e.g', 'Elisabetta', 'reference', 'Fontainebleau', 'great', 'last', 'act', 'aria', 'characters', 'motivations', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'clear', 'common', 'use', 'Verdi', 'revised', 'four-act', 'version', 'must', 'look', 'own', 'terms.I', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Rolando', 'Villazon', 'Don', 'Carlo', 'expected', 'singing', 'superb', 'voice', 'crisp', 'expressive', 'such', 'careful', 'attention', 'phrasing', 'piece', 'fresh', 'new', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Villazon', 'interpretation', 'title', 'character', 'thought', 'took', 'same', 'approach', 'Don', 'Carlo', 'did', 'Alfredo', '2005', 'Salzburg', 'production', 'La', 'Traviata', 'hard', 'believe', 'two', 'characters', 'being', 'so', 'utterly', 'different', 'temperament', 'circumstance', 'operas', 'Villazon', 'onstage', 'demeanor', 'immature', 'crazed', 'adolescent', 'flailing', 'around', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'troubled', 'complex', 'Don', 'Carlo', 'said', 'DVD', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'hear', 'Villazon', 'sing.Amanda', 'Roocroft', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'sparkling', 'Fiordiligi', 'Theatre', 'du', 'Chatalet', '1992', 'DVD', 'Mozart', 'Cosi', 'Fan', 'Tutte', 'hard', 'meet', 'demands', 'Elisabetta', 'role', ""n't"", 'require', 'performer', 'be', 'dramatic', 'soprano', 'case', 'many', 'Verdi', 'roles', 'Aida', 'example', 'voice', 'required', 'Elisabetta', 'heavier', 'strictly', 'lyric', 'soprano', 'word', 'spinto', 'often', 'used', 'quality', 'voice', 'spinto', 'meaning', 'pushed', 'Italian', 'course', 'skill', 'push', 'sounding', 'pushed', 'voice', 'must', 'naturally', 'sound', 'lyrical', 'considerable', 'heft', 'Roocroft', 'attempts', 'meet', 'vocal', 'requirements', 'role', 'sound', 'harsh', 'strained', 'especially', 'when', 'upper', 'register', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'having', 'off', 'night', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'production', 'was', 'filmed', 'several', 'nights', 'not', '.Violetta', 'Urmana', 'Eboli', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Not', 'only', 'not', 'act', 'part', 'femme', 'fatale', 'chorus', 'are', 'downright', 'clunky', 'Veil', 'Song', 'flowing', 'Castilian', 'sound', 'melodic', 'piece', 'should', 'come', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'doom', 'gloom', 'previous', 'scenes', 'most', 'subsequent', 'ones', 'Urmana', 'better', 'O', 'Don', 'Fatale', 'finally', 'just', 'deep', 'chest', 'voice', 'relax', 'show', 'stuff.The', 'person', 'who', 'most', 'ease', 'role', 'Dwayne', 'Croft', 'Rodrigo', 'beautiful', 'lyrical', 'baritone', 'voice', 'duets', 'Villazon', 'are', 'highlight', 'production', 'Robert', 'Lloyd', 'fine', 'job', 'Philip', 'II', 'even', 'though', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'voice', 'lost', 'power.Lastly', 'was', 'disappointed', 'directorial', 'choice', 'make', 'Don', 'Carlo', 'fate', 'clear', 'end', 'Irresolution', 'one', 'themes', 'opera', 'beginning', 'end', 'what', 'Verdi', 'librettist', 'intended', 'prefer', 'be', 'left', 'way']",N/A
