454819,AEMZRE6QYVQBS,6305225788,David A. Baer,"[2, 2]","Bill Paxton is the anchor column of this lean HBO film, but the best acting comes courtesy of Donal Logue as the reporter whom Paxon's Lt. Colonel John Paul Vann befriends early on and Ed Lauter as General Weyand. There is some very stiff work from other members of the cast, but the film succeeds on the strength of the drama it portrays.The story of what went wrong for the US operation in Vietnam is still amenable to two or three widely differing explanations, each of which has deep plausibility. LIE portrays Paxton's character understanding the nationalist nature of the communist insurrection early on when he was posted to Viet Nam as one of the United States' first military advisors there. Gradually, however, he becomes lulled into the failed ambition to solve 'Vietnam's problem' by military means as he rises to the opportunity to become 'America's warrior' over against North Vietnam's brilliant General Giap.In spite of some contrived work, the realism of the film's subject matter is underscored by the use of some remarkable footage from the era, including tape from the astonishing Tet Offensive in 1968. Although this Viet Cong vie for the cities during the lull of the Vietnam New Year celebration was for them a military failure, it shook whatever American confidence in the enterprise remained at that date and brought high American casualty counts and images of brutal urban warfare into American living rooms.BRIGHT SHINING LIE is a vital film for those of us who still want to understand the American failure in Vietnam, the origins of the conflict, and how best to assure that future military interventions begin with and are sustained by a comprehension of the facts on the ground and just how malleable they may or may not be.",4,what went wrong?,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,1755,"['Bill', 'Paxton', 'anchor', 'column', 'lean', 'HBO', 'film', 'best', 'acting', 'courtesy', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'reporter', 'whom', 'Paxon', 'Lt', 'Colonel', 'John', 'Paul', 'Vann', 'early', 'Ed', 'Lauter', 'General', 'Weyand', 'very', 'stiff', 'work', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'film', 'strength', 'drama', 'story', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'US', 'operation', 'Vietnam', 'still', 'amenable', 'two', 'three', 'widely', 'differing', 'explanations', 'deep', 'plausibility', 'LIE', 'Paxton', 'character', 'understanding', 'nationalist', 'nature', 'communist', 'insurrection', 'early', 'when', 'was', 'posted', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'one', 'United', 'States', 'first', 'military', 'advisors', 'there', 'Gradually', 'however', 'lulled', 'failed', 'ambition', 'solve', ""'Vietnam"", 'problem', 'military', 'means', 'opportunity', 'become', ""'America"", 'warrior', 'North', 'Vietnam', 'brilliant', 'General', 'Giap.In', 'spite', 'contrived', 'work', 'realism', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'underscored', 'use', 'remarkable', 'footage', 'era', 'including', 'tape', 'astonishing', 'Tet', 'Offensive', '1968', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'vie', 'cities', 'lull', 'Vietnam', 'New', 'Year', 'celebration', 'was', 'military', 'failure', 'shook', 'American', 'confidence', 'enterprise', 'remained', 'date', 'brought', 'high', 'American', 'casualty', 'counts', 'images', 'brutal', 'urban', 'warfare', 'American', 'living', 'rooms.BRIGHT', 'SHINING', 'LIE', 'vital', 'film', 'who', 'still', 'want', 'understand', 'American', 'failure', 'Vietnam', 'origins', 'conflict', 'how', 'best', 'assure', 'future', 'military', 'interventions', 'begin', 'are', 'sustained', 'comprehension', 'facts', 'ground', 'just', 'how', 'malleable', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be']",N/A

Later, he returns to Vietnam as a civilian and achieves de-facto 2-star rank as a Senior Advisor given virtual command of South Vietnamese troops opposing a North Vietnamese Army offensive before himself being killed in a helicopter crash.Since A BRIGHT SHINING LIE came to me as a bonus DVD packaged with BAND OF BROTHERS, I thought it therefore might be rather cheesy. But, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this HBO original film release. Why, it was almost of Big Screen production quality.Granted, when Paxton gets steely-eyed and juts his jaw aggressively, there's not the same heroic effect as displayed in WE WERE SOLDIERS (2002), but we all can't be Mel Gibson. However, the film effectively shows a man whose inner drive compels him to go to war, have the audacity to think he can win it single-handed, and cheat on his wife as a form of relaxation. One can almost see the testosterone sloshing back and forth.For a small screen release, the combat scenes and special FX are quite good. As a peace statement, the producers went out of their way to include every infamous image of the era: the protesting Buddhist monk setting himself ablaze, the young Vietnamese girl running naked from her village that's just been bombed into an inferno, the captive Viet Cong being shot in the head by a South Vietnamese officer during the Tet Offensive. But, for all that, the anti-war message isn't overbearing because, thirty-some years later, the wrongness of the American presence in that quagmire is perhaps, in retrospect, a nationally accepted consensus.A BRIGHT SHINING LIE does illustrate well, perhaps as a reminder to any superpower that wants to get involved in a Third World conflict, the pervasive local corruption that manipulates and the complete indifference, if not outright opposition, to an outside presence felt by the bulk of the populace. In that atmosphere, and under the stress to achieve some ill-conceived government definition of a win, even well intentioned and patriotic men such as Vann can be led astray by events and their own fervor.",4,A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do,1104278400,"12 29, 2004",2004,2658,"['BRIGHT', 'SHINING', 'LIE', 'ostensibly', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'American', 'involvement', 'Vietnam', 'conflict', 'period', '1962-1972', 'middle', 'ground', 'ridiculously', 'gung-ho', 'GREEN', 'BERETS', '1968', 'blatantly', 'anti-war', 'APOCALYPSE', 'NOW', '1979', 'PLATOON', '1986', '.Bill', 'Paxton', 'John', 'Paul', 'Vann', 'lieutenant', 'colonel', 'first', 'assigned', 'Military', 'Assistance', 'Command', 'Vietnam', '1962', 'who', 'later', 'resigned', 'cloud', 'telling', 'anyone', 'who', ""'d"", 'listen', 'including', 'press', 'Army', 'top', 'brass', 'was', 'botching', 'war', 'bad', 'career', 'move', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'Later', 'Vietnam', 'civilian', 'de-facto', '2-star', 'rank', 'Senior', 'Advisor', 'given', 'virtual', 'command', 'South', 'Vietnamese', 'troops', 'opposing', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'Army', 'offensive', 'being', 'killed', 'helicopter', 'crash.Since', 'BRIGHT', 'SHINING', 'LIE', 'came', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'packaged', 'BAND', 'OF', 'BROTHERS', 'thought', 'therefore', 'might', 'be', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'quality', 'HBO', 'original', 'film', 'release', 'Why', 'was', 'almost', 'Big', 'Screen', 'production', 'quality.Granted', 'when', 'Paxton', 'steely-eyed', 'jaw', 'aggressively', 'not', 'same', 'heroic', 'effect', 'displayed', 'WE', 'WERE', 'SOLDIERS', '2002', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'However', 'film', 'effectively', 'man', 'inner', 'drive', 'compels', 'go', 'war', 'have', 'audacity', 'think', 'can', 'win', 'single-handed', 'cheat', 'wife', 'form', 'relaxation', 'One', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'testosterone', 'sloshing', 'back', 'forth.For', 'small', 'screen', 'release', 'combat', 'scenes', 'special', 'FX', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'peace', 'statement', 'producers', 'went', 'way', 'include', 'infamous', 'image', 'era', 'protesting', 'Buddhist', 'monk', 'setting', 'ablaze', 'young', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'running', 'naked', 'village', 'just', 'been', 'bombed', 'inferno', 'captive', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'being', 'shot', 'head', 'South', 'Vietnamese', 'officer', 'Tet', 'Offensive', 'anti-war', 'message', ""n't"", 'overbearing', 'thirty-some', 'years', 'later', 'wrongness', 'American', 'presence', 'quagmire', 'perhaps', 'retrospect', 'nationally', 'accepted', 'consensus.A', 'BRIGHT', 'SHINING', 'LIE', 'illustrate', 'well', 'perhaps', 'reminder', 'superpower', 'get', 'involved', 'Third', 'World', 'conflict', 'pervasive', 'local', 'corruption', 'complete', 'indifference', 'not', 'outright', 'opposition', 'outside', 'presence', 'felt', 'bulk', 'populace', 'atmosphere', 'stress', 'achieve', 'ill-conceived', 'government', 'definition', 'win', 'even', 'well', 'intentioned', 'patriotic', 'men', 'such', 'Vann', 'can', 'be', 'led', 'astray', 'events', 'own', 'fervor']",N/A
454825,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305225788,Matthew Horner,"[7, 8]","This is a well-intentioned biopic of John Paul Vann [Bill Paxton], a fascinating man who was intimately involved in the Vietnam War, both as a soldier and a civilian. It is a less than satisfying film because it attempts to cover much of our involvement in Vietnam [1962-1972] while simultaneously conveying a lot about Vann's personal life. For example, Vann was a womanizer. We see him with his wife and children in America. During his first tour of Vietnam, he takes up with a Vietnamese school teacher. His wife eventually divorces him. Later, he meets and marries another Vietnamese girl. These events by themselves could make for a complicated movie. ""A Bright Shining Lie"" also shows many of the highlights of the war, which itself is an even more complicated drama. The story is better suited to a miniseries. For more than a `Cliff's Notes' view, read the excellent book by Neil Sheehan upon which it is based.Paxton is fine as Vann, but there are no pivotal scenes that define the character for us. We never feel we know him that well. Many other characters, most notable the women, appear for a while, then just disappear.The action sequences are exceptionally well done, especially for a made for TV movie.The film presents a point of view [someone who was a leader and an insider in the war] that's different from those in other Vietnam War movies, but it lacks the emotional impact of the best of them, such as ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"" and ""Coming Home"".",3,Less than satisfactiory film version of the book,1020297600,"05 2, 2002",2002,1471,"['well-intentioned', 'biopic', 'John', 'Paul', 'Vann', '[', 'Bill', 'Paxton', ']', 'fascinating', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'intimately', 'involved', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'soldier', 'civilian', 'less', 'satisfying', 'film', 'cover', 'much', 'involvement', 'Vietnam', '[', '1962-1972', ']', 'simultaneously', 'conveying', 'lot', 'Vann', 'personal', 'life', 'example', 'Vann', 'was', 'womanizer', 'see', 'wife', 'children', 'America', 'first', 'tour', 'Vietnam', 'up', 'Vietnamese', 'school', 'teacher', 'wife', 'eventually', 'Later', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'events', 'could', 'make', 'complicated', 'movie', 'Bright', 'Shining', 'Lie', 'also', 'many', 'highlights', 'war', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'drama', 'story', 'better', 'suited', 'miniseries', 'more', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'view', 'read', 'excellent', 'book', 'Neil', 'Sheehan', 'based.Paxton', 'fine', 'Vann', 'are', 'pivotal', 'scenes', 'define', 'character', 'never', 'feel', 'know', 'well', 'Many', 'other', 'characters', 'most', 'notable', 'women', 'appear', 'while', 'then', 'just', 'disappear.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'made', 'TV', 'movie.The', 'film', 'point', 'view', '[', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'leader', 'insider', 'war', ']', 'different', 'other', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'movies', 'emotional', 'impact', 'best', 'such', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Platoon', 'Coming', 'Home']",N/A

Col. John Paul Vann's personal life and his 1962-63 tour of Vietnam as a senior advisor to part of the South Vietnamese Army. At first, he thinks the officers mean well and their men would tear the VC a new one in no time, but then he comes to realize the fact that the army is corrupted and their units take official pictures of their ""credited kills,"" which compose of some of their own soldiers playing dead by laying down next to the numbers of dead VC on the ground and boosting their numbers that way. The Vietnamese officer casually explains to Vann that their government has taken some of the dead VC away, and they need the proof of numbers for President Diem.Vann soon becomes alarmed when he notices the South Vietnamese keep sending troops into areas that were already cleared in order to ""cleanse the area thoroughly"" and how they seem to fall back from VC ambushes instead of holding their ground and fighting back. Despite Vann's dream of getting promoted past Lieutenant-Colonel for his efforts, the generals are furious in his way of telling the truth about the disasters in these battles, which had been claimed as victories, and after he soon gets back to the States, he resigns his commission in disgust.His relationship with his wife worsens over the years, especially when Vann volunteers to go back to Vietnam in ""any available capacity"" just to get his views heard on how they can win the war, and is involved with the corrupt South Vietnamese Army once more, especially when they napalm a village full of friendly civilians that Vann and his team had helped earlier. His actions in this war gets him close to the top-ranking generals and the U.S. ambassador of South Vietmam, especially during the Tet Offensive of '68, and Vann is soon buried in the duties of his new job that brings him the equivalent of a two-star general and as the first American civilian to ever actually command combat troops, most of which happened in the Easter Offensive of '72, when most of the combat U.S. troops had already pulled out. His actions at Kontum against at least two divisions of North Vietnamese regulars prevent South Vietnam from being cut in half, at least for another three years, and was named one of the victims when his helicopter crashed in a rainstorm shortly after. Sadly, his name is not on the list of the 58,000 Americans who died in Vietnam, despite what he had done on the behalf of both countries.Bill Paxton played an excellent role as John Paul Vann and couldn't be a better candidate for the real man himself.
