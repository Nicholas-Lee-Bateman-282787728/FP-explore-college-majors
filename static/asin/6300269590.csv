235053,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6300269590,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[6, 11]","Of all the popular authors of recent years, Michael Crichton has to be the one with the most uneven track record of film adaptation.  Success with material like ""The Andromeda Strain"" and ""Jurassic Park,"" and even TV's ""ER,"" is tempered by sludge like ""Congo"" and this near disaster.  Should only be viewed by film students who want to learn how NOT to make a film.The premise is that a man named Harry Benson (George Segal) has suffered a brain injury that causes seizures resulting in uncontrollable violent behavior.  He volunteers to undergo implantation of a ""limbic pacer,"" which is kind of like a pacemaker but it's in the brain, controlling the seizures.  Naturally the procedure (first ever in a human) doesn't work, and we see the disastrous results of said failure.Yes, the entire plot is really as simple as that.  It is a situation fraught with opportunity for psychological drama that would draw us in, involving the subject's mental anguish on a personal and interpersonal level.  Instead Segal practically sleep-walks through the whole thing, apparently bored to death with his psychotic life.Adding to the boredom is the bizarre directorial decision to use practically no musical soundtrack.  Perhaps the belief was that it would heighten the otherworldliness and detachment of the characters from their situation, as much of the other direction goes to great lengths to dehumanize almost everyone in this film, taking its cue from Benson's belief that the computers of his day (1974) were competing with humans and would eventually take over the world.  Any resemblance to ""The Matrix"" abruptly ends there, as the director chooses to use that belief as a backdrop that only makes the film dull to the point of somnolence.I could nitpick about the technical errors regarding the OR, such as (1) having virtually no conversation among OR personnel, (2) horrendous sound editing, and (3) postoperative dictation in which the surgeon feels he has to carefully spell the inanely common term ""limbic.""  There are even two embarrassing moments early in the film when two different characters voice their opposition to the surgery, one who states ""I'm against it"" at a moment when a more thorough explanation would be appropriate, and another who inappropriately rambles on and on with a veritable sermon on hell fire and brimstone.  Laughably bad.The story is interesting enough and most of the supporting actors are credible, but overall this turkey should be left as a monument to bad ideas in filmmaking of the early 1970s.

Hard to say why Hodges chose to shoot it at such a glacial pace or in such somber, funereal tones. Maybe he was going for the Kubrick Effect. But Terminal Man is no Space Odyssey. It's an extremely simple Crichton story: A bunch of cold, arrogant scientists and doctors hook George Segal's brain up to a computer, and guess what happens next? Rod Serling could have dispatched with it handily in a half-hour episode, with commercial breaks. Stretching it across almost two hours of glum, deadpan film just didn't work. Neither do the Roger Daltry wig and ice cream suit Segal wears through the last act -- it's like a clown suit. That last act has most of the movie's good scenes, but you have to sit through more than an hour of tedium to get to it, and by that point I personally didn't care what happened to the guy.

235059,A2X25C107CSLOR,6300269590,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[6, 12]","One has to wonder, after the success of Westworld which Michael Crichton wrote and directed, why he would allow Mike Hodges to make such a mess of  The Terminal Man. At least Crichton had the sense to do his own Coma. The  premise of this film is akin to Crichton's ongoing concern with the  impersonality that seems to go with advances in medical technology. Here it  is believed that surgery can correct violent behaviour, since it is thought  that those disposed to violent acts are simply brain damaged. George Segal  plays Harry Benson, a computer genius who suffers from  &quot;para-epilepsy&quot; which has resulted him in having blackouts with  uncontrollable rages. He agrees to surgery, which is untried on humans, (we  never find out the effects on the animals that came before him, but  presumably they are no longer &quot;brain damaged&quot;) and has an  electronic computer implanted into his brain to tranquilise and abort the  violent impules. There's no prize for guessing the treatment is a failure  and soon the computer is overloading stimulants and pushing Harry into  regular seizures. Hodges gives such painstaking detail to the operation  that we soon realise that his interest is the miniature of  the surgery and  not in giving his audience a good time. His hospital plays Muzak in the  corridors and he otherwise has Glenn Gould playing Bach on his soundtrack.  The fact that he doesn't use an action score is probably symptomatic of  Hodges' inappropriate restraint. He teases us with eye through a peephole  observations as Harry's mind (I think), Them on TV, and one great image of  Harry running maniacally through cemetary headstones. Just when the final  cemetary scene arouses your interest, with Harry fallen into an about-to-be  used grave, Hodges disappoints us by turning him into a Christ-figure.  George Segal has previously demonstrated his range in comedy and drama, but  here his uncontrollable rages are pretty tepid. I guess when one considers  who to cast as a paranoid psychotic, Segal doesn't come to mind. Hodges  actually never shows him in a direct attack, and when he tries to break  through a locked door a la Jack Nicholson in The Shining, I was waiting for  the &quot;Here's Johnny&quot; gag. It also doesn't help that Segal is  dressed in a ridiculous wig and white suit as if he is in a dubbed Italian  movie. Playing Segal's girlfriend, before her Unmarried Woman breakthrough,  Jill Clayburgh is given thankless scenes but still manages to contribute  some goofiness. As Harry's doctor, Joan Hackett is also under-used. Hodges  recalls the infamous photos of Frances Farmer being arrested with similar  pics of Harry, and there is an objection to the surgery from someone who  reminds us of how disastrous frontal lobotomies were at the time. What is  unintentionally amusing is how one of the doctors on staff is played by an  actor with a huge bare forehead, as if he has already been under the  ice-pick.",1,Mike Hodges is the terminal man,966729600,"08 20, 2000",2000,2966,"['One', 'wonder', 'success', 'Westworld', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'wrote', 'directed', 'why', 'would', 'allow', 'Mike', 'Hodges', 'make', 'such', 'mess', 'Terminal', 'Man', 'least', 'Crichton', 'had', 'sense', 'do', 'own', 'Coma', 'premise', 'film', 'akin', 'Crichton', 'ongoing', 'concern', 'impersonality', 'go', 'advances', 'medical', 'technology', 'Here', 'believed', 'surgery', 'can', 'correct', 'violent', 'behaviour', 'thought', 'disposed', 'violent', 'acts', 'are', 'simply', 'brain', 'damaged', 'George', 'Segal', 'Harry', 'Benson', 'computer', 'genius', 'who', 'quot', 'para-epilepsy', 'quot', 'resulted', 'having', 'blackouts', 'uncontrollable', 'rages', 'surgery', 'untried', 'humans', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'effects', 'animals', 'came', 'presumably', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'quot', 'brain', 'damaged', 'quot', 'electronic', 'computer', 'implanted', 'brain', 'tranquilise', 'abort', 'violent', 'impules', 'prize', 'guessing', 'treatment', 'failure', 'soon', 'computer', 'overloading', 'stimulants', 'pushing', 'Harry', 'regular', 'seizures', 'Hodges', 'such', 'painstaking', 'detail', 'operation', 'soon', 'realise', 'interest', 'miniature', 'surgery', 'not', 'giving', 'audience', 'good', 'time', 'hospital', 'plays', 'Muzak', 'corridors', 'otherwise', 'Glenn', 'Gould', 'playing', 'Bach', 'soundtrack', 'fact', ""n't"", 'use', 'action', 'score', 'probably', 'symptomatic', 'Hodges', 'inappropriate', 'restraint', 'eye', 'peephole', 'observations', 'Harry', 'mind', 'think', 'Them', 'TV', 'one', 'great', 'image', 'Harry', 'running', 'maniacally', 'cemetary', 'headstones', 'Just', 'when', 'final', 'cemetary', 'scene', 'interest', 'Harry', 'fallen', 'about-to-be', 'used', 'grave', 'Hodges', 'turning', 'Christ-figure', 'George', 'Segal', 'previously', 'demonstrated', 'range', 'comedy', 'drama', 'here', 'uncontrollable', 'rages', 'are', 'pretty', 'tepid', 'guess', 'when', 'one', 'considers', 'who', 'cast', 'paranoid', 'psychotic', 'Segal', ""n't"", 'come', 'mind', 'Hodges', 'actually', 'never', 'direct', 'attack', 'when', 'break', 'locked', 'door', 'la', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Shining', 'was', 'waiting', 'quot', 'Here', 'Johnny', 'quot', 'gag', 'also', ""n't"", 'help', 'Segal', 'dressed', 'ridiculous', 'wig', 'white', 'suit', 'dubbed', 'Italian', 'movie', 'Playing', 'Segal', 'girlfriend', 'Unmarried', 'Woman', 'breakthrough', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'given', 'thankless', 'scenes', 'still', 'contribute', 'goofiness', 'Harry', 'doctor', 'Joan', 'Hackett', 'also', 'under-used', 'Hodges', 'infamous', 'photos', 'Frances', 'Farmer', 'being', 'arrested', 'similar', 'pics', 'Harry', 'objection', 'surgery', 'someone', 'who', 'how', 'disastrous', 'frontal', 'lobotomies', 'were', 'time', 'What', 'unintentionally', 'amusing', 'how', 'one', 'doctors', 'staff', 'played', 'actor', 'huge', 'bare', 'forehead', 'already', 'been', 'ice-pick']",N/A

They are all still with us as of 4/2008 (Sadly Ms. Hackett is not).This is a superior film with brilliant set design and costuming. From the sterility of the Hospital (known only as ""Babel"" from the subtly placed and nearly nearly invisible emblems), to the mind-numbing anonymity of the staff uniforms, few films are as well dressed as this. Only the dissenting staff, Dr's Ross and Manon, show any hint of individuality in their work apparel. Ironically it is Benson the patient, supposedly insane, who displays the most humanity of all, with the possible exception of Dr Ross. Segal was brilliant, and severely under-utilized in the film. Perhaps the filmmakers thought that necessary, in order to emphasize the dehumanization of the hospital and its staff. But a bit more contrast could have been provided IMO. Still, the film is excellent nonetheless.Today's society however, with its short attention span, will likely be permanently disappointed. To those who complain that this film is ""slow"" (and they are legion); I would say to either learn some patience, or simply avoid the film and go back to your action/adventure.While made in the early 1970's, it is  highly relevant to today's world as well.
