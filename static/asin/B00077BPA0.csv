877668,AVBYL0BIAZ8IB,B00077BPA0,Aaron J. Palmer,"[8, 12]","Imagine if Uwe Boll had made the Lord of the Rings trilogy instead of Peter Jackson.  That's about the quality of film you get here.  This pathetic effort to bring Ursula Le Guin's first two Earthsea books (A Wizard of Earthsea / The Tombs of Atuan) to the small screen is an abomination, a disgrace, and in insult to the author in every way.  Any thinking person who has respect for the original works will have nothing to do with this production.  Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea books rank among the greatest works of fantasy ever written.  They are also among the most unique and intellectual.  The Sci-Fi production turned those books into generic fantasy that any hack could have written.  There may be one compelling reason to see this production:  It will show you exactly how not to adapt a book to film.  It also might tell you something about how dumbed down American culture has become, that the people behind this production thought an eviscerated version of Le Guin's books were all the public could handle.Why do I react so negatively to this production?  Here are the major reasons in outline form:1.  Race is a central theme of LeGuin's Earthsea books.  That theme was totally removed from the movie for no apparent reason.  It would be like removing languages from Tolkien's work.  In the books, the only white people in Earthsea are the Kargs.  Everyone else is non-white, which is how Le Guin constructed her world for very specific reasons.  She has called this production a ""whitewashing"" of Earthsea, and I personally think it was a gutless decision on the producers' part to do so.2.  The stories have been altered arbitrarily to create a generic adventure / fantasy movie at the expense of the book's main themes.  Gender is also an issue in Le Guin's writing, and it not to be found here.  Ged's entire maturation experience (a huge theme of the first book) is made meaningless by the plot changes in this movie.  He never has to pay the price for what he does.  The lesson that there is a price or a reaction for everything you do is largely forgotten.  The producers show now respect for the book by rearranging seemingly small details at will.  They even get Ged's name wrong!  His true name is Ged, not Sparrowhawk.3.  Even in technical terms this is a bad film.  The acting, with maybe the exception of Danny Glover, is wooden.  The dialog is unnatural.  The settings are generic.  The effects are substandard (the dragon is nearly laughable).  The characters (not Le Guin's...the film's) are not believable and give the audience little reason to care about them.I could go on, but you probably get the idea by now.  Look up Ursula Le Guin's personal website, and read what she has to say on the subject.  She says it far better than I can.",1,Abomination,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,2765,"['Imagine', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'had', 'made', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'instead', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'quality', 'film', 'get', 'here', 'pathetic', 'effort', 'bring', 'Ursula', 'Le', 'Guin', 'first', 'two', 'Earthsea', 'books', 'Wizard', 'Earthsea', '/', 'Tombs', 'Atuan', 'small', 'screen', 'abomination', 'disgrace', 'insult', 'author', 'way', 'thinking', 'person', 'who', 'respect', 'original', 'works', 'will', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'production', 'Ursula', 'Le', 'Guin', 'Earthsea', 'books', 'rank', 'greatest', 'works', 'fantasy', 'ever', 'written', 'are', 'also', 'most', 'unique', 'intellectual', 'Sci-Fi', 'production', 'turned', 'books', 'generic', 'fantasy', 'hack', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'compelling', 'reason', 'see', 'production', 'will', 'show', 'exactly', 'how', 'not', 'adapt', 'book', 'film', 'also', 'might', 'tell', 'something', 'how', 'dumbed', 'down', 'American', 'culture', 'become', 'people', 'production', 'thought', 'eviscerated', 'version', 'Le', 'Guin', 'books', 'were', 'public', 'could', 'handle.Why', 'do', 'react', 'so', 'negatively', 'production', 'Here', 'are', 'major', 'reasons', 'outline', 'form:1', 'Race', 'central', 'theme', 'LeGuin', 'Earthsea', 'books', 'theme', 'was', 'totally', 'removed', 'movie', 'apparent', 'reason', 'would', 'be', 'removing', 'languages', 'Tolkien', 'work', 'books', 'only', 'white', 'people', 'Earthsea', 'are', 'Kargs', 'Everyone', 'else', 'non-white', 'how', 'Le', 'Guin', 'constructed', 'world', 'very', 'specific', 'reasons', 'called', 'production', 'whitewashing', 'Earthsea', 'personally', 'think', 'was', 'gutless', 'decision', 'producers', 'part', 'do', 'so.2', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'altered', 'arbitrarily', 'create', 'generic', 'adventure', '/', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'expense', 'book', 'main', 'themes', 'Gender', 'also', 'issue', 'Le', 'Guin', 'writing', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Ged', 'entire', 'maturation', 'experience', 'huge', 'theme', 'first', 'book', 'made', 'meaningless', 'plot', 'changes', 'movie', 'never', 'pay', 'price', 'what', 'lesson', 'price', 'reaction', 'everything', 'do', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'producers', 'show', 'now', 'respect', 'book', 'rearranging', 'seemingly', 'small', 'details', 'will', 'even', 'get', 'Ged', 'name', 'wrong', 'true', 'name', 'Ged', 'not', 'Sparrowhawk.3', 'Even', 'technical', 'terms', 'bad', 'film', 'acting', 'maybe', 'exception', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'wooden', 'dialog', 'unnatural', 'settings', 'are', 'generic', 'effects', 'are', 'substandard', 'dragon', 'nearly', 'laughable', 'characters', 'not', 'Le', 'Guin', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'believable', 'give', 'audience', 'little', 'reason', 'care', 'them.I', 'could', 'go', 'probably', 'get', 'idea', 'now', 'Look', 'up', 'Ursula', 'Le', 'Guin', 'personal', 'website', 'read', 'what', 'say', 'subject', 'far', 'better', 'can']",N/A

877672,A24ZKGYGJU5GK7,B00077BPA0,Amazon Customer,"[13, 16]","This mini-series is supposedly based on the first two novels of Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea Cycle: A Wizard of Earthsea and The Tombs of Atuan.  But in fact it has very little to do with.It is one of the worst book-to-screen-adaptations that I've ever seen. LeGuin's books were full of great character development. The characters were center stage. Ged - the main character - in particular changed a lot over time. He went from rash young boy to powerful, wise mage (though he didn't quite get all the wisdom until about the third book). Added to that, the world of earthsea is an interesting one and the adventures that Ged had were interesting.But the mini-series is just a shadow of the books. There is little or no character development. Ged is always rash and impetuous. He never really changes. The events in the books shaped him and had purpose. In the mini-series, the few scenes from the books that got put on screen were there to show off special effects and had no depth to them.The two books that the mini-series is based on occurred years apart and the only real common thread between them is Ged. And not only did the mini-series try and cram the two together they created a new character to be the villain of their story and created a threat over the entirety of Earthsea that Ged had to deal with. Neither ""A Wizard of Earthsea"" nor ""The Tombs of Atuan"" had a king trying to take over the world or a power that was going to destroy the world if Ged didn't do something. They were about Ged and his adventures - in particular how he learned and grew from them - and not the end of the world. Added to that, they tried to make LeGuin's rather platonic books into a love story.In short, in spite of the claims of the makers of the mini-series that they stayed faithful to the books, they weren't even close. They took great fantasy and made a horrible mess of it. It's now cliched to death and isn't worth touching with a ten foot pole. LeGuin herself said that they ruined her books. They didn't even consult her on it. The only reason that she let anyone make it is that originally the person who was going to write the mini-series was one of the writers for The Lord of the Rings movies (Phillipa Boyens). But by the time that the mini-series was made, next to none of the people who were involved originally had anything to do with it anymore (Phillipa Boyens included).If you've read the books, you'll hate this mini-series. If not, you might enjoy it - my friend did (but he's never read the books), but this mini-series is so far off from LeGuin's books that if they changed the names, I'm not sure that anyone could even sue them for plagiarism.",1,This is not Ursula K.

877673,AK0CENM3LUM28,B00077BPA0,Amazon Customer,"[4, 5]","Earthsea / B00077BPA0*Spoilers*I haven't read the Earthsea book that this is based on, although I do own it and intend to read it, even after suffering through this horrible adaptation, because the comments here lead me to believe that the book is far, far better. Fair enough.Having said that, this was a pretty awful movie. Weighing in at three hours long (apparently this was originally aired in pieces on the Sci-Fi channel), this plodding cliche-ridden movie is a genuinely terrible attempt at fantasy, with only a few bright points of redemption.To start, the audio in this movie is absolutely terrible and makes the movie unwatchable almost from the beginning. I usually note in my reviews whether a movie is packaged with captions for the hearing impaired, as I generally require captions in order to follow along with the dialogue. Earthsea is not provided with captions, which disappointed me but isn't as unusual as one might think, so I expected to simply rely on my viewing companions for the words I miss. The audio quality is so terrible, however, that even my perfect-hearing boyfriend could not discern what was being said on screen half the time. The opening narration by Glover is so garbled that, even after watching it EIGHT times in a row, all we could make out was ""&lt;garble> &lt;garble> &lt;garble> Earthsea &lt;garble> &lt;garble> Nameless Ones &lt;garble>"". The visual effects allowed us to piece together the back story of a nunnery, an amulet, and a sealed door with evil behind it, but that was more to do with cliched fantasy tropes than decent sound editing. The audio got worse from there - the actors frequently mumble their lines and we were deeply annoyed every time ""Sparrowhawk"" came out as ""Spare-A-Hawk"". Enunciation should not be limited to A-list actors.Too much of the plot is compelled by convenient actions and assumptions that are never explained. The hero and heroine have lifelong visions of one another for no reason other than it facilitates the plot and allows them to ""trust one another"" immediately in circumstances where they otherwise would not. The timeline is disjointed - with the breaking of the amulet being presented as ancient history (the nuns study pictures of it in their history classes, the people speak distantly of it as 'lost forever', the head magus never expected to look upon it in his lifetime, etc.) and yet the breaking of the amulet turns out to be a relatively recent phenomena because that way the Old Woman At The Beginning can have turned out to be the nun who started it all. Why, then, are people so resigned that the amulet is 'lost forever' when the losing was so recent? Human nature isn't like that - there should be hundred of ne'er-do-wells looking for the darn thing, and why, please, have the sisters never noticed that a large chunk of the thing is embedded in a key they see daily?I am also baffled by the idea that one would send a powerful young wizard to learn discipline in an academy that clearly exercises no discipline whatsoever over its most unruly members. The murder scene with the serving nun is simply ludicrous - a person does not simply stand there and let themselves be quietly strangled to death without kicking, struggling, or otherwise fighting. And I make a motion that the blatant Bring The Cheery Dead Side-Kick Back To Life cliche be banned from all future fantasy movies. Seriously.The only thing I really liked about this movie was the idea that the ""evil"" emotions one carries must be acknowledged as real in order to be a whole person. It's a little too easy these days to go the ""anger must never be felt"" route these days. I much prefer a philosophy that acknowledges that our anger is simply a part of us and while we shouldn't be controlled by it, neither should we expect to be able expel it entirely. However, I may be giving this movie too much credit in order to say SOMETHING nice about it. Well, here's one other good thing - I liked seeing Isabella Rossellini from ""Death Becomes Her"" in this movie. Her voice is always lovely and her acting is solid.I do not own this movie, I rented it from my Blockbuster Online account.~ Ana Mardoll",2,Poor Fantasy Fare,1236902400,"03 13, 2009",2009,4168,"['Earthsea', '/', 'B00077BPA0*Spoilers*I', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Earthsea', 'book', 'based', 'do', 'own', 'intend', 'read', 'even', 'suffering', 'horrible', 'adaptation', 'comments', 'here', 'lead', 'believe', 'book', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'Fair', 'enough.Having', 'said', 'was', 'pretty', 'awful', 'movie', 'Weighing', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'apparently', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'pieces', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'plodding', 'cliche-ridden', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'terrible', 'attempt', 'fantasy', 'only', 'few', 'bright', 'points', 'redemption.To', 'start', 'audio', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'movie', 'unwatchable', 'almost', 'beginning', 'usually', 'note', 'reviews', 'movie', 'packaged', 'captions', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'generally', 'require', 'captions', 'order', 'follow', 'along', 'dialogue', 'Earthsea', 'not', 'provided', 'captions', 'disappointed', ""n't"", 'as', 'unusual', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'so', 'expected', 'simply', 'rely', 'viewing', 'companions', 'words', 'miss', 'audio', 'quality', 'so', 'terrible', 'however', 'even', 'perfect-hearing', 'boyfriend', 'could', 'not', 'discern', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'screen', 'time', 'opening', 'narration', 'Glover', 'so', 'garbled', 'even', 'watching', 'EIGHT', 'times', 'row', 'could', 'make', 'out', 'was', 'lt', 'garble', '>', 'lt', 'garble', '>', 'lt', 'garble', '>', 'Earthsea', 'lt', 'garble', '>', 'lt', 'garble', '>', 'Nameless', 'Ones', 'lt', 'garble', '>', 'visual', 'effects', 'allowed', 'piece', 'together', 'back', 'story', 'nunnery', 'amulet', 'sealed', 'door', 'evil', 'was', 'more', 'do', 'cliched', 'fantasy', 'tropes', 'decent', 'sound', 'editing', 'audio', 'got', 'worse', 'actors', 'frequently', 'mumble', 'lines', 'were', 'deeply', 'annoyed', 'time', 'Sparrowhawk', 'came', 'out', 'Spare-A-Hawk', 'Enunciation', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'limited', 'A-list', 'actors.Too', 'much', 'plot', 'compelled', 'convenient', 'actions', 'assumptions', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'hero', 'heroine', 'have', 'lifelong', 'visions', 'one', 'reason', 'other', 'plot', 'trust', 'one', 'immediately', 'circumstances', 'where', 'otherwise', 'would', 'not', 'timeline', 'disjointed', 'breaking', 'amulet', 'being', 'presented', 'ancient', 'history', 'nuns', 'study', 'pictures', 'history', 'classes', 'people', 'speak', 'distantly', ""'lost"", 'forever', 'head', 'magus', 'never', 'expected', 'look', 'lifetime', 'etc', 'yet', 'breaking', 'amulet', 'out', 'be', 'relatively', 'recent', 'phenomena', 'way', 'Old', 'Woman', 'Beginning', 'can', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'nun', 'who', 'started', 'Why', 'then', 'are', 'people', 'so', 'resigned', 'amulet', ""'lost"", 'forever', 'when', 'losing', 'was', 'so', 'recent', 'Human', 'nature', ""n't"", 'should', 'be', 'hundred', ""ne'er-do-wells"", 'looking', 'darn', 'thing', 'why', 'please', 'have', 'sisters', 'never', 'noticed', 'large', 'chunk', 'thing', 'embedded', 'key', 'see', 'daily', 'am', 'also', 'baffled', 'idea', 'one', 'would', 'send', 'powerful', 'young', 'wizard', 'learn', 'discipline', 'academy', 'clearly', 'discipline', 'whatsoever', 'most', 'unruly', 'members', 'murder', 'scene', 'serving', 'nun', 'simply', 'ludicrous', 'person', 'not', 'simply', 'stand', 'there', 'let', 'be', 'quietly', 'strangled', 'death', 'kicking', 'struggling', 'otherwise', 'fighting', 'make', 'motion', 'blatant', 'Bring', 'Cheery', 'Dead', 'Side-Kick', 'Back', 'Life', 'cliche', 'be', 'banned', 'future', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'Seriously.The', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'idea', 'evil', 'emotions', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'real', 'order', 'be', 'whole', 'person', 'little', 'too', 'easy', 'days', 'go', 'anger', 'must', 'never', 'be', 'felt', 'route', 'days', 'much', 'prefer', 'philosophy', 'anger', 'simply', 'part', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'controlled', 'should', 'expect', 'be', 'able', 'expel', 'entirely', 'However', 'may', 'be', 'giving', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'credit', 'order', 'say', 'SOMETHING', 'nice', 'Well', 'here', 'one', 'other', 'good', 'thing', 'liked', 'seeing', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'Death', 'Becomes', 'Her', 'movie', 'voice', 'always', 'lovely', 'acting', 'solid.I', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'movie', 'rented', 'Blockbuster', 'Online', 'account.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A

It was hard to tell, and we ARE New Zealanders.You must also pity the main cast - Shawn Ashmore, Kristin Kreuk, Danny Glover and Isabella Rosellini - all very talented people who were doomed in the face of a script written by someone who hated the Earthsea books and a story that was completely void of the themes, motifs and atmosphere that actually gave the books any meaning at all.All of a sudden Sparrowhawk is a white pretty boy, the Tombs of Atuan are a nicely lit subway system and the Convent at Atuan is a sappy resort full of super-religious nuns who seem like they're about to break out in a Julie Andrews number.  That whole ""The Nameless Ones are imprisoned by our faith - we must pray!"" was utter barf and completely ruined everything that the books established about Atuan.  It was supposed to be a dark cult of sinister women who stole Tenar as a child and brainwashed her into forgetting her true identity.  ARGH!Some of the CGI scenery looked like an old computer game.  And I must reiterate - all the truly interesting themes and atmospheric elements from the book were destroyed!!  Anyone who loves the mini series cannot have read the books.

At least here we have the appearance of the character to help. In fact, that part is the only thing I have against this film, and as I say, that's part of the book series. Or perhaps it's the effect of doing three or four books in one movie.Ged is a handsome young lad who is the blacksmith's son, but he knows he's destined for something much more than following in his father's footsteps. Sure enough, at a critical moment, a magician, Ogion (Danny Glover) appears and offers to tell him his true name (Sparrowhawk) and to teach him about magic. Reluctantly, his father agrees to let him go with Ogion.But Ged is impatient, and is not prepared to learn at the pace in which Ogion wants to teach. Ogion's way is rather zen, in fact. Once it becomes clear that Ged's impatience is going to get him into a huge amount of trouble, Ogion recommends he go to the island where magic is taught rather like Hogwarts. (The Earthsea books are older than the Potter books, BTW.) He does, but gets in enough trouble there that he is forced to leave without finishing his education. Fortunately, his best friend Tygath has been graduated and is taking up a post as the local sorcerer in his old home town. He suggests that if Ged ever needs his help, he should call him by his true name.Why does poor Ged keep getting in trouble? Two big reasons: his impatience, and his destiny. He is destined to bring together the two broken pieces of the Amulet of Peace. How he does this is but one of the major plot lines.Another important one is the sisterhood of priestesses that guards the place where the Unnamed Ones are kept imprisoned. In response to a stupid schoolboy dare, Ged conjures up the spirit of a dead queen, which has the effect of releasing one of these horrible demons. He manages to defeat it, or at least to fend it off, by the timely appearance of the headmaster (a sort of Dumbledore who eats too much), but not without serious injury. The most serious injury, we realize pretty quickly, is that he now has three long scars on his cheek from the monster which make him way too easy to identify.Because it's not just the monster that is searching for him now. It's the evil King of the invading forces who is determined to conquer all of Earthsea with the aid of a high-ranking priestess within the guardian sisterhood who will stop at nothing to be made the successor to the high priestess and gain the secret of the chamber in which the unnamed ones are imprisoned.Dragons and shapeshifters and monsters and good magic and evil magic and beautiful maidens and brave heroes: this movie has everything.

First, you have director Robert Lieberman who (basically) is a director/producer of B-list style made-for-TV films (Killer Instinct, The Dead Zone, etc.). Second, you have an incredibly popular book series written by Le Guin who had nothing to do with the writing of the screenplay (""I watched helplessly as they took out everything that I cherished about Earthsea."" And there was nothing the author could do because, as is the case with most screenplay adaptations, Mrs. Le Guin had sold the rights). Authors need to put forward some serious thought about money versus loss of rights before signing on the dotted line and skipping to their bank, a healthy check in hand. I can't help but think that if Ursula Le Guin had been able to keep her fingers in the screenplay-pie, this adaptation would've turned out much differently. But, alas, this is what we have. A steaming pile of unwizardly dung!I do think that the acting was okay. Just okay. Danny Glover, Isabella Rossellini, Shawn Ashmore, etc., all performed well.

I caught this on cable TV a couple times and I found it reasonably enjoyable. Not the effects, acting, or music of the level of ""The Lord of the Rings"" but certainly far better than I have seen on several Fantasy TV series. Danny Glover and some of the other key actors I think turned in decent performances. The F/X aren't bad either, far from low budget ones like those used in the remakes of ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"". I recommend this if you haven't read the books and you enjoy fantasy movies. Now of course I am sure the books are far better and seeing this movie I can now go read them and be really entertained all the more. I guess that is the down side of reading the books and then seeing the movie instead of the other way around. Suffice it to say I wish people would review the merit of the acting, sets, scenery, music, directing, special effects, et cetera, instead of how it didn't follow the book line for line. Keep in mind people are reading your review to find out if the movie is any good, they actually might not have read the book and it may not matter if the movie is like the book to them. I understand you avid readers being upset, but please don't dash a reasonable movie to pieces. If the movie does well it is more likely they will make more and then hopefully they will try harder to follow the books. If this one fails dismally it is not near as likely they will make more movies for several years. So even if it is only like the book in title, do not be hasty to slam the directing, acting, sets, music, F/X, et cetera. After I saw the movie I wanted to read the books and I intend to do just that. Then I'm sure I will see that this was not a good adaptation.

This unexpected revelation of power brings him great attention, not only from the power-hungry monarch who has been forewarned of a great wizard with the powers to defeat him, but also from Ogion (Danny Glover), an old and wise mage who gives Ged his true name and offers to educate him in the ways of magic. Leaving his family and friends behind to journey with Ogion into the mountains and learn the trade, Ged is dissatisfied with his slow-moving education. He wishes to learn the arts, but Ogion is determined to teach him responsibility before power. When Ged nearly unleashes an ancient evil from the earth, Ogion decides to send him to the island of wizardry, to study with other youths under the tutelage of the finest mages in Earthsea.Ged rapidly devours knowledge, putting his peers to shame. Among his most outspoken critics is Lord Jasper (Mark Hildreth), an elitist with a private agenda. Their rivalry amuses the students and alarms the staff, rapidly becoming deadly as Jasper provokes Ged to attempt to raise a former mage from the dead. Instead, Ged summons an Unnamed One, a dark and terrible evil from the bowls of the earth, destined to consume those in its path and ultimately possess its master. The guardians of this ancient force are the priestesses of a neighboring island. Their leader, Thar (Isabella Rossellini), is growing old and searches for a successor. King Tygath is hoping it will be his mistress (Jennifer Calvert) but the more likely candidate is Tenar (Kristen Kreuk), who has proven intelligence, insight, and powerful strength. Tenar has seen a vision of a boy wizard, and they believe him to be responsible for the desecration of the temple and the release of evil.Ged has also seen Tenar in his dreams. Forced to leave the school and spend a life fleeing the thing which hunts him, he returns to Ogion for council. He must defeat the monster he has unleashed and save Earthsea from a terrible fate. Along the way he will encounter powerful forces, find his own magical talents, defeat a dragon, and encounter true love. Very loosely based on the highly popular series of books by Ursula K. Le Guin, Legend of Earthsea is not a bad fantasy. It has engaging characters, subtle humor, and enough mystery to keep you intrigued. Written after Tolkien and before Rowling, you can see influences of both in the storytelling aspect: the boy wizard and a school of magic, and a king desiring to take over the world. Even so, it never feels too familiar. Much of the film is completely from the mind of filmmakers rather than relying on Guin's ingenious storytelling, but even then the miniseries has merit.For a series considered by many to be on-par with The Lord of the Rings, the computer-generated world is shoddy and unrealistic. It looks fake from a distance, from the little craft bobbing on the sea to the magnificent wizarding palace atop the cliffs. Oddly enough, the creatures and uses of magic are quite the opposite; demons from the underworld are hideous, trees sprout in the middle of luncheon and bear fruit, and school boys laughingly put their hands through solid objects. If there is to be any single complaint with the series, it is that Tenar is not given as much screen time as Ged. Her world is significantly less interesting than his, but her role is no less important. She's under-used in the first installment and given more influence in the second. She's very enigmatic although oddly enough, Mother Thar is the most likable character. There's also the food-obsessed wizard sidekick who provides a nice counterpoint for Ged's seriousness.It is still worthwhile but sadly tainted by irresponsible writers who apparently felt Guin wasn't engaging enough on her own, so they had to completely rewrite her work. If you go in searching for a true-to-the-books adaptation, you will be disappointed, but if you go in simply for the pleasure of discovering a new fantasy universe full of mages, magic, and evils to be defeated, you'll find yourself enthralled with Earthsea.",3,"not true to the book, but engaging",1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,4218,"['When', 'lands', 'Earthsea', 'are', 'threatened', 'tyrannical', 'King', 'Tygath', 'Sebastian', 'Roch', 'young', 'Ged', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'astonishing', 'feat', 'magic', 'protect', 'village', 'invading', 'forces', 'unexpected', 'revelation', 'power', 'brings', 'great', 'attention', 'not', 'only', 'power-hungry', 'monarch', 'who', 'been', 'forewarned', 'great', 'wizard', 'powers', 'defeat', 'also', 'Ogion', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'old', 'wise', 'mage', 'who', 'Ged', 'true', 'name', 'educate', 'ways', 'magic', 'Leaving', 'family', 'friends', 'journey', 'Ogion', 'mountains', 'learn', 'trade', 'Ged', 'dissatisfied', 'slow-moving', 'education', 'learn', 'arts', 'Ogion', 'determined', 'teach', 'responsibility', 'power', 'When', 'Ged', 'nearly', 'ancient', 'evil', 'earth', 'Ogion', 'send', 'island', 'wizardry', 'study', 'other', 'youths', 'tutelage', 'finest', 'mages', 'Earthsea.Ged', 'rapidly', 'knowledge', 'putting', 'peers', 'shame', 'most', 'outspoken', 'critics', 'Lord', 'Jasper', 'Mark', 'Hildreth', 'elitist', 'private', 'agenda', 'rivalry', 'students', 'staff', 'rapidly', 'becoming', 'deadly', 'Jasper', 'Ged', 'attempt', 'raise', 'former', 'mage', 'dead', 'Instead', 'Ged', 'Unnamed', 'One', 'dark', 'terrible', 'evil', 'bowls', 'earth', 'destined', 'consume', 'path', 'ultimately', 'possess', 'master', 'guardians', 'ancient', 'force', 'are', 'priestesses', 'neighboring', 'island', 'leader', 'Thar', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'growing', 'old', 'successor', 'King', 'Tygath', 'hoping', 'will', 'be', 'mistress', 'Jennifer', 'Calvert', 'more', 'likely', 'candidate', 'Tenar', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'who', 'proven', 'intelligence', 'insight', 'powerful', 'strength', 'Tenar', 'seen', 'vision', 'boy', 'wizard', 'believe', 'be', 'responsible', 'desecration', 'temple', 'release', 'evil.Ged', 'also', 'seen', 'Tenar', 'dreams', 'Forced', 'leave', 'school', 'spend', 'life', 'fleeing', 'thing', 'Ogion', 'council', 'must', 'defeat', 'monster', 'unleashed', 'save', 'Earthsea', 'terrible', 'fate', 'way', 'will', 'encounter', 'powerful', 'forces', 'find', 'own', 'magical', 'talents', 'defeat', 'dragon', 'encounter', 'true', 'love', 'Very', 'loosely', 'based', 'highly', 'popular', 'series', 'books', 'Ursula', 'K.', 'Le', 'Guin', 'Legend', 'Earthsea', 'not', 'bad', 'fantasy', 'engaging', 'characters', 'subtle', 'humor', 'enough', 'mystery', 'keep', 'intrigued', 'Written', 'Tolkien', 'Rowling', 'can', 'see', 'influences', 'storytelling', 'aspect', 'boy', 'wizard', 'school', 'magic', 'king', 'desiring', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'Even', 'so', 'never', 'too', 'familiar', 'Much', 'film', 'completely', 'mind', 'filmmakers', 'rather', 'relying', 'Guin', 'ingenious', 'storytelling', 'even', 'then', 'miniseries', 'merit.For', 'series', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'on-par', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'computer-generated', 'world', 'shoddy', 'unrealistic', 'fake', 'distance', 'little', 'craft', 'bobbing', 'sea', 'magnificent', 'wizarding', 'palace', 'cliffs', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'creatures', 'uses', 'magic', 'are', 'quite', 'opposite', 'demons', 'underworld', 'are', 'hideous', 'trees', 'sprout', 'middle', 'luncheon', 'bear', 'fruit', 'school', 'boys', 'laughingly', 'put', 'hands', 'solid', 'objects', 'be', 'single', 'complaint', 'series', 'Tenar', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Ged', 'world', 'significantly', 'less', 'interesting', 'role', 'less', 'important', 'under-used', 'first', 'installment', 'given', 'more', 'influence', 'second', 'very', 'enigmatic', 'oddly', 'enough', 'Mother', 'Thar', 'most', 'likable', 'character', 'also', 'food-obsessed', 'wizard', 'sidekick', 'who', 'nice', 'counterpoint', 'Ged', 'seriousness.It', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'sadly', 'tainted', 'irresponsible', 'writers', 'who', 'apparently', 'felt', 'Guin', 'was', ""n't"", 'engaging', 'enough', 'own', 'had', 'completely', 'rewrite', 'work', 'go', 'searching', 'true-to-the-books', 'adaptation', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'go', 'simply', 'pleasure', 'discovering', 'new', 'fantasy', 'universe', 'full', 'mages', 'magic', 'be', 'defeated', ""'ll"", 'find', 'enthralled', 'Earthsea']",N/A

However, having said that I also believe that any problems which the movie had, resulted from the director's fundamental misunderstanding of the material which he had to work with.He did tone down the sex scenes, which the sci-fi channel wanted in order to make this appeal to an adult audience (18-35 age group.)  Director Robert Lieberman wanted a show that he could feel comfortable about his kids watching.  That's a good thing.Regarding the fact that Ms.  Leguin wasn't consulted as some of the other reviews have stated.  She was in fact consulted at Mr. Lieberman, but not the sci-fi channel, and the people that brought the rights to the Earthsea books.  I formed these impressions by watching the DVD commentary.The only objections which the director says he was made aware of were: the author thought that there should be more ethnicity in earthsea.  Secondly she objected to whole passages of dialogue being redacted.  These are objections that any author who cared about her work would have.The director explained on the commentary that he had to work within the time, and budget constraints of the sci-fi network who had input every step of the way.  They even objected to uniforms the students wore on the island of Roke.  ""They thought that it looked too much like Harry Potter.""  At the school the director kept saying that he did not mages in pointy hats.  This was I believe his first fundamental misunderstanding of the material.  Who ever said that mages have to wear pointy hats.  This was my first hint that he had no clue about the genre he was working in.Next the director objected to talking dragons, ""he thought they were cartoon like,"" and wanted to put the dragons dialogue in subtitles.  Again I believe that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the material, and the genre.  To me earthsea was all about Ged and the dragons.  Which is why I am amazed that the movie is so good, because it came from someone who didn't understand the material he was given but gave us his perception of earthsea.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[12, 15]","Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea books are full of magic, mystery, philosophy and intensely powerful storytelling.But you wouldn't know it by this lackluster adaptation. Instead, ""Earthsea"" aspires to be ""Harry Potter"" in a medieval ""Lord of the Rings"" setting, with two plots mishmashed haphazardly into one, shoddy special effects, laughable action scenes, and some seriously wooden acting.Rebellious, impatient Ged (Shawn Ashmore) attracts the attention of the wizard Ogion  (Danny Glover) when he magically rescues his village from raiders. He joins Ogion as an apprentice, but soon proves too impatient -- and so Ogion sends him to the wizard school on Roke, where Ged soon proves to be one of the most gifted pupils. But his pride and anger become his undoing, when he accidentally summons a foul demon.Meanwhile on the island of Atuan, the High Priestess (Isabella Rossellini) is slowly wasting away, and she hastily selects her successor, teenage Tenar (Kristin Kreuk). What no one knows is that the king of the Kargides is having her poisoned, and his priestess lover is trying to find a way into the labyrinth below, where the dangerous Nameless Ones are kept. To save all of Earthsea, Ged must brave its most terrifying dangers.""Earthsea"" basically is two books' worth of plots crammed together, but not well -- the entire tone is changed to ""Harry Potter in Middle-Earth,"" with the plucky wizard pupil on a roadtrip with his funny chubby buddy against the forces of evil. The entire time at Roke just reeks of Hogwarts.Even if judged purely on its own merits, ""Earthsea"" is still a disaster -- the direction is clunky, and the special effects are amateurish at best. Moments that should have been brilliant, such as Ged's climactic confrontation with the Gebbeth, fall flat. By the time we get to the drippy, sentimental climax, the entire plot spirals into a Disneyesque lovefest that is nothing short of nauseating.And the script isn't much better. In fact, it's simply atrocious, full of unintentionally hilarious moments (a lisping dragon), deus ex machinae, a surprisingly silly demonic threat, and horribly written cliched dialogue (""So this is our destiny?"" ""If not us, then who?""). When Vetch and Ged dress up as Kargides to fool an idiot commander, you know the movie has hit rock bottom.It doesn't help that Ashmore and Kreuk are tolerable actors at best, but they get progressively more wooden as the plot continues. They're only saved by the greater talent of the other actors -- Chris Gauthier is lovable AND smart as Ged's best buddy, and Glover and Alan Scarfe are given too little to do as some paternal old wizards. (And Amanda Tapping has a split-second cameo)Isabella Rossellini deserves special credit as High Priestess Thar. I'm not sure what an actress of her caliber is doing in a movie like ""Earthsea,"" but she saves every scene she's in -- she's warm, kindly, wise, powerful and devastating in her disapproval.The Sci Fi Channel tried to have it all in ""Earthsea,"" but ended up with a muddled mess that tries to be everything, and ends up with nothing.

877688,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B00077BPA0,Enjolras,"[0, 1]","To start off with, I've never read the Earthsea books, so I'm judging the movie on its own merits. Unfortunately, even without comparing it to the book, there are a lot problems with this movie.First of all, not having read the book, there's nothing about the story that sticks out. A wizard is found, goes to training school, and saves the world from an evil warlord. Sound familiar? It's a mix of Dune, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Harry Potter, among other things. The one aspect that makes Earthsea somewhat unique is the emphasis on good and evil and dangers of knowledge without wisdom. However, the movie doesn't approach that theme nearly as subtly as the other aforementioned works.The main character, Ged, is a mix of unbelievable power and stupidity. He never seems to struggle with magic and seems to have more power than any magician in the school, despite also being the newest. There's no struggle. However, he also violates just about every rule despite repeatedly being told that there would be negative consequences. Overall, he's a particularly unlikeable and unrealistic character.What really kills the movie is the acting - it reeks of ""made-for-TV movie"". Shawn Ashmore, the main character Ged, sounds like he's reading his lines off a teleprompter. Many of the supporting characters sound even more ridiculous, particularly Ged's father (who fortunately isn't a central character). Kristin Kreuk looks hot but is overly dramatic. There are exceptions. Danny Glover as Ogion comes across powerfully as an elderly and curmudgeonly wizard. I thought he gave a solid performance. The Arch Magus is probably my favorite wizard aside from Gandalf. However, for an adaptation of such a seminal book it'd be nice to think the producers would invest in real actors.Also, I have to say a word about the special effects. They're OK, but look blatantly fake in a few places. Near the beginning, in a scene where it's supposed to be raining, you can actually see that the rain is only falling near the actors as the trees aren't getting hit by the rainwater! You'd think the special effects team would have figured that one out. The cardinal rule of special effects is that if you can't make it look real, hide the fact with clever editing or lighting.Earthsea is definitely a watchable movie and at times entertaining if you're a fan of fantasy. I can kind of see a few gems that might hint at an epic story. Unfortunately, it doesn't make for a powerful advertisement for LeGuin's book. I really wish the producers had backed this movie wholeheartedly and given it a chance and invested what the film needed in order to tell the story properly.",3,"mediocre quality, even without comparing to the book",1344211200,"08 6, 2012",2012,2661,"['start', 'off', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Earthsea', 'books', ""'m"", 'judging', 'movie', 'own', 'merits', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'comparing', 'book', 'are', 'lot', 'problems', 'movie.First', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'nothing', 'story', 'out', 'wizard', 'found', 'training', 'school', 'world', 'evil', 'warlord', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'mix', 'Dune', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'other', 'things', 'one', 'aspect', 'Earthsea', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'emphasis', 'good', 'evil', 'dangers', 'knowledge', 'wisdom', 'However', 'movie', ""n't"", 'approach', 'theme', 'nearly', 'as', 'subtly', 'other', 'aforementioned', 'works.The', 'main', 'character', 'Ged', 'mix', 'unbelievable', 'power', 'stupidity', 'never', 'struggle', 'magic', 'have', 'more', 'power', 'magician', 'school', 'also', 'being', 'newest', 'struggle', 'However', 'also', 'just', 'about', 'rule', 'repeatedly', 'being', 'told', 'would', 'be', 'negative', 'consequences', 'Overall', 'particularly', 'unlikeable', 'unrealistic', 'character.What', 'really', 'movie', 'acting', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'main', 'character', 'Ged', 'reading', 'lines', 'off', 'teleprompter', 'Many', 'supporting', 'characters', 'sound', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'particularly', 'Ged', 'father', 'who', 'fortunately', ""n't"", 'central', 'character', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'hot', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'are', 'exceptions', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Ogion', 'across', 'powerfully', 'elderly', 'curmudgeonly', 'wizard', 'thought', 'gave', 'solid', 'performance', 'Arch', 'Magus', 'probably', 'favorite', 'wizard', 'aside', 'Gandalf', 'However', 'adaptation', 'such', 'seminal', 'book', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'think', 'producers', 'would', 'invest', 'real', 'actors.Also', 'have', 'say', 'word', 'special', 'effects', ""'re"", 'OK', 'look', 'blatantly', 'fake', 'few', 'places', 'beginning', 'scene', 'where', 'supposed', 'be', 'raining', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'rain', 'only', 'falling', 'actors', 'trees', 'are', ""n't"", 'getting', 'hit', 'rainwater', ""'d"", 'think', 'special', 'effects', 'team', 'would', 'have', 'figured', 'one', 'out', 'cardinal', 'rule', 'special', 'effects', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'look', 'real', 'hide', 'fact', 'clever', 'editing', 'lighting.Earthsea', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'movie', 'times', 'entertaining', ""'re"", 'fan', 'fantasy', 'can', 'kind', 'see', 'few', 'gems', 'might', 'hint', 'epic', 'story', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'make', 'powerful', 'advertisement', 'LeGuin', 'book', 'really', 'wish', 'producers', 'had', 'backed', 'movie', 'wholeheartedly', 'given', 'chance', 'invested', 'what', 'film', 'needed', 'order', 'tell', 'story', 'properly']",N/A
877689,A8E1J9IDU18V9,B00077BPA0,Garth R. Mailman,"[0, 1]","Having read the 6 volumes of the Earthsea Series written by Ursula K. Le Guin I was moved to rewatch the movie version. Just because you're young and foolish and rich, (or middle-age crazy), enough to own a car registered at 320 KM/Hr doesn't make it legal to cruise HWY 400 at 200 MPH. By the same token the fact that you can perform a certain task doesn't necessarily make it wise to do so. Wisdom defines the difference between can and may, what it is possible to do and what one should do. Many's the trial lawyer who has learned the hard way that he/she should never ask a question in open court to which he is not certain he knows the answer. When exercising the use of power one must always be mindful of the full consequences of that act.The above mini-sermon forms the basis for the first few books of Earthsea and the movie based upon them. Ged was raised without a mother by his Blacksmith father and has become an impatient, headstrong, impulsive but talented wizard. The movie does violence to the books' storyline; the principal characters are all there but the circumstances of most have been radically changed. Shot in the Gulf Islands of Vancouver's Inside Passage the music evokes a Celtic Background that is hauntingly beautiful. Why anyone would cast Shawn Ashmore in a part and then make him appear so dowdy is beyond me. The make-up department would seem to have been very busy, the gebbath appears to owe much to Munch's The Scream.

877692,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B00077BPA0,General Breadbasket,"[5, 9]","""Earthsea"" is a two part mini-series, each part roughly an hour and a half long. Apparently it's loosely based on the ""Earthsea"" book series by Ursula K. Le Guin, which I hadn't read when I saw this. I think it was fairly entertaining for a cable mini-series, and it kept my attention far better than, say, Peter Jackon's intepretation of Lord of the Rings.The feature tells the tale of a young blacksmith called Ged (Shawn Ashmore from ""Animorphs""), who works with his father in a rather quiet village. He misses his mother, he misses the feeling of family, and yearns to see the world outside his village. His yearnings come to pass when a wizard (Danny Glover) visits his town, gives him a the name ""Sparrowhawk"", and takes him on as an apprentice. He is proud and impatient, competitive and makes many mistakes, which will come back to haunt him more than mentally. Will he be able to put things right again?I was quite surprised at the negative response here on amazon. Like I said, I haven't read the books, but even as an adaption it's surely not that bad. The acting walked the fine line between melodrama and warmth fairly well, and didn't come off as pretentious, unlike a few other recent fantasy films. There is deception, and intrigue and lust, but it's not done too cheesily (again, like some bigger budget sci-fi/fantasy films). I liked use of deep saturated colours in some of the scenes, it gave the film an atmosphere I haven't seen anywhere else. It isn't a traditional fantasy film look, but I don't think it's neccessarily a bad one either. Its a look that could take off and be developed, I reckon. Shawn Ashmore has grown up a lot since the Animorphs TV series, and it was interesting to watch him play the lead.I suppose there are a lot of things this film doesn't have that a fantasy is ""supposed"" to have, but its not like that's a bad thing. It didn't feel boring to me, it didn't feel annoying or irritating or sickening or confusing or anything like that. There's very little that I felt was that negative about the film, unless I'm being ultra, ultra picky for the sake of it, so personally I can't think of any good reason to criticize it.Yeah, so it's worth a look for open minded fans of fantasy, who understand that these companies do the best with what they've got, that its a 2 part cable special and not a multi million dollar box office smash.",4,An Earthsea to See on DVD,1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,2381,"['Earthsea', 'two', 'part', 'mini-series', 'part', 'roughly', 'hour', 'half', 'long', 'loosely', 'based', 'Earthsea', 'book', 'series', 'Ursula', 'K.', 'Le', 'Guin', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'when', 'saw', 'think', 'was', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'cable', 'mini-series', 'kept', 'attention', 'far', 'better', 'say', 'Peter', 'Jackon', 'intepretation', 'Lord', 'Rings.The', 'feature', 'tale', 'young', 'blacksmith', 'called', 'Ged', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'Animorphs', 'who', 'father', 'rather', 'quiet', 'village', 'mother', 'feeling', 'family', 'yearns', 'see', 'world', 'village', 'yearnings', 'come', 'pass', 'when', 'wizard', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'town', 'name', 'Sparrowhawk', 'apprentice', 'proud', 'impatient', 'competitive', 'many', 'mistakes', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'more', 'mentally', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'put', 'things', 'right', 'again', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'negative', 'response', 'here', 'amazon', 'said', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'even', 'adaption', 'surely', 'not', 'bad', 'acting', 'walked', 'fine', 'line', 'melodrama', 'warmth', 'fairly', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'pretentious', 'few', 'other', 'recent', 'fantasy', 'films', 'deception', 'intrigue', 'lust', 'not', 'done', 'too', 'cheesily', 'again', 'bigger', 'budget', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'films', 'liked', 'use', 'deep', 'saturated', 'colours', 'scenes', 'gave', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anywhere', 'else', ""n't"", 'traditional', 'fantasy', 'film', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'neccessarily', 'bad', 'one', 'either', 'look', 'could', 'take', 'off', 'be', 'developed', 'reckon', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'grown', 'up', 'lot', 'Animorphs', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch', 'play', 'lead.I', 'suppose', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'fantasy', 'supposed', 'have', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'annoying', 'irritating', 'sickening', 'confusing', 'anything', 'very', 'little', 'felt', 'was', 'negative', 'film', ""'m"", 'being', 'ultra', 'ultra', 'picky', 'sake', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'reason', 'criticize', 'it.Yeah', 'look', 'open', 'minded', 'fans', 'fantasy', 'who', 'understand', 'companies', 'do', 'best', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', '2', 'part', 'cable', 'special', 'not', 'multi', 'million', 'dollar', 'box', 'office', 'smash']",N/A

The acting is terrible (and casting -- eg, Danny Glover as Ogion?), the script even worse, the special effects so campy there are several instances in which I can tell that the ENTIRE scene is generated by computer graphics (eg, the port at Atuan as the camera comes in ""from the sky"").  And, as a HUGE fan of the books (they are my favorites of all time... the first three, anyway), the fact that this movie bears almost no resemblance to them is almost unforgiveable.  In fact, they don't even get Ged's real name right!  His REAL name is Ged, his known name is Sparrowhawk.  Oh, and they left out my favorite character from the first book, the Otak.  Not only are the plot and characters very different -- drasitcally different -- than in the books, but its *feel* is drastically different, too.  Peter Jackson's LOTR, at least, had a similar feel to Tolkien's book, but this film has a feel all its own.So, there is much to complain about, and it's a pity that what in my opinion is the greatest written work in fantasy has been adapted so poorly for the screen.  Notwithstanding, there is something I like a lot about this film, and I've even watched it several times.  I don't know why, but there is something I really truly like about it... something I cannot quite put my finger on.

Instead it had moments of charm, a few small laughs (not always intentional) and some good acting. It has been a very long time since I read the books but I did recognize that several key things were omitted, glossed over or barely touched on. But that was also true of Lord of the Rings when they omitted one of my favorite characters, Tom Bombadil.Comparing this film to the Lord of the Rings is very unfair since almost nothing does compare to those epics. I'd rather compare it to the David Lynch version of Dune - so different as to hardly resemble the book other than place and character names and events. If you can manage to overcome those differences you can enjoy either movie, though I'd have to say Lynch's Dune is immensely better than the Earthsea movie.If they did take liberties with the souce material, that's hardly new, no matter how regrettable it is.

However, EarthSea is a far worse abomination that totally disparages the award-winning novel by Ursula K. Le Guin on which it is based. In fact, EarthSea is the perfect example of how not to adapt a novel into a film.The first and most egregious act by the filmmakers was to change the racial identity of the people of EarthSea. Instead of showing us a very unique fantasy world which is inhabited by people of color, the filmmakers decided that it was best to give audiences the stereotypical European fantasy tale. In order to throw a bone to the racially diverse novel, Danny Glover is trotted out as the 'token' black character. What an insult to the unique fantasy world that Le Guin lovingly created!The story itself pays little heed to the plot of the novel, barely referencing characters and setting to maintain some appearance of being faithful to the novel. To make matters worst, the acting is quite awful. I often found myself shaking my head at many of the performances.After Peter Jackson raised the bar for fantasy films to a high level with The Lord of the Rings, I actually thought filmmakers would at least try to live up to the new standard.

LeGuin, is an above-average production of the SciFi Channel.  I've heard the movie is actually very loosely based on the books, and that LeGuin thinks this film is a travesty, but she should realize that seeing this flick has probably peaked the interests of many people who want to find out just how closely the movie follows the books.I'll be honest and say that I've never read any of the ""Earthsea"" books.  In fact, I'd never even heard of them before SciFi threw this production out for viewing.  It looks something like a modern day version of J.R.R. Tolkien's books.  Of course, it doesn't come close to those books or the ""Lord Of The Rings"" films.  However, it does feed those hungry for some fantasy/adventure.  There've been a ton of ""LOTR"" copycats, and I think this flick is one of the better ones.I won't go into a huge explanation of the plot, but it goes a little like this:  Much like Frodo from ""LOTR,"" the hero of this film is an unexpected nobody named Ged, played by Shawn Ashmore(""Iceman"" from the ""X-Men"" flicks). He sets out to stop the evil King Tygath, who wants to rule Earthsea.  Standing in Tygath's way are a group of wizards at a school(not unlike Hogwart's in the ""Harry Potter"" stories, though ""Earthsea"" was written before those novels), and a high priestess played with little flair by Isabella Rosselini.  She looked stiff throughout this film.  Danny Glover plays Ged's mentor, Ogion.  He seems to be trying too hard to come across as a mix of Gandolf, Yoda, and Dumbledore, resulting in a cookie-cutter ""sage-like"" character that really doesn't fit well in the story. Kristen Kreuk(Smallville) does a decent job as the potentially powerful priestess, Tenar.The overall production is pretty good on this film considering it's a SciFi Channel production.  If only they'd spent as much money on the actual story, I might have given this a better review.In closing, I'll agree with other reviewers in saying that ""Earthsea"" is an ambitious television production, but it falls flat in the end.  As stated before, one good thing about this flick is that it probably peaked interest in plenty of folks who might not have read the original books and now want to check them out.Recommended to fans of the fantasy genre, especially those like me who haven't read the original books.

877709,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00077BPA0,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[78, 93]","Throughout the last two decades of the 20th century the fantasy genre gained a large number of followers, which initially might have been influenced by encounters with J.R.R. Tolkien's adventures or roll playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons.  This group of people has steadily grown through the help of computer games, books, and other media that brings the audience away from the reality of the human existence.  Thus, the Sci-Fi Channel delivers the Legend of Earthsea to this growing fan base.The televised miniseries Legend of Earthsea is an adventure that brings the audience away from reality to the world of Earthsea where the world consists of a vast number of islands.  The author Ursula K. Le Guin created this world and she has a large number of dedicated readers.  More can be found on her website, [...] in regards to her books and comments in regards to the TV series.Legend of Earthsea opens in a small island village where the blacksmith's son, Ged (Shawn Ashmore) discovers that he has magical powers.  Ged, a restless young man, saves the town from an attack through the use of magic, which brings forth the wizard Ogion (Danny Glover).  Ogion requests that Ged becomes his student, but Ged's father initially rejects the request.  Nonetheless, Ged becomes the pupil of Ogion, as he begins his journey on becoming a wizard.On this journey the audience gets to follow how Ged is coming of age through foolish magical stunts and deadly encounters with dragons and other dangerous creatures. Ged builds lasting friendships and eventually discovers the wonder of love.  Through many adventures with Ged the audience will experience both suspense and drama with some wisdom.The mini-series seems to be based on a number of clich&eacute;s from other fantasy films such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Willow (1988) among other films.  This hurts the story, as does the visual experience through some CGI effects that come across with visual awkwardness.  If one truly wants to experience the world of Earthsea the audience should reads Ursula K. Le Guin's books, which are far superior to this TV story.Earthsea had great potential, as the books offer a solid foundation upon which a film can be made.  However, it seems that this film shows the affects of too many chefs, which leaves the audience with a somewhat flat fantasy experience.  There are interesting subplots and themes, but it never takes off and flies by itself.  It merely remains standing on the ground displaying a monument without value, which in the end will leave most viewers disappointed.  It might only be a rental recommendation to those hardcore fantasy enthusiasts that watch everything about an alternative reality.",2,Great Fantasy Potential Falls Flat...,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,2717,"['last', 'two', 'decades', '20th', 'century', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'gained', 'large', 'number', 'followers', 'initially', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'influenced', 'encounters', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'adventures', 'roll', 'playing', 'games', 'such', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'group', 'people', 'steadily', 'grown', 'help', 'computer', 'games', 'books', 'other', 'media', 'audience', 'away', 'reality', 'human', 'existence', 'Thus', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'Legend', 'Earthsea', 'growing', 'fan', 'base.The', 'televised', 'miniseries', 'Legend', 'Earthsea', 'adventure', 'audience', 'away', 'reality', 'world', 'Earthsea', 'where', 'world', 'vast', 'number', 'islands', 'author', 'Ursula', 'K.', 'Le', 'Guin', 'created', 'world', 'large', 'number', 'dedicated', 'readers', 'More', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'website', '[', ']', 'regards', 'books', 'comments', 'regards', 'TV', 'series.Legend', 'Earthsea', 'small', 'island', 'village', 'where', 'blacksmith', 'son', 'Ged', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'magical', 'powers', 'Ged', 'restless', 'young', 'man', 'town', 'attack', 'use', 'magic', 'forth', 'wizard', 'Ogion', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Ogion', 'requests', 'Ged', 'student', 'Ged', 'father', 'initially', 'request', 'Nonetheless', 'Ged', 'pupil', 'Ogion', 'journey', 'becoming', 'wizard.On', 'audience', 'follow', 'how', 'Ged', 'coming', 'age', 'foolish', 'magical', 'stunts', 'deadly', 'encounters', 'dragons', 'other', 'dangerous', 'creatures', 'Ged', 'lasting', 'friendships', 'eventually', 'wonder', 'love', 'many', 'adventures', 'Ged', 'audience', 'will', 'experience', 'suspense', 'drama', 'wisdom.The', 'mini-series', 'be', 'based', 'number', 'clich', 'eacute', 'other', 'fantasy', 'films', 'such', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Willow', '1988', 'other', 'films', 'story', 'visual', 'experience', 'CGI', 'effects', 'come', 'visual', 'awkwardness', 'one', 'truly', 'experience', 'world', 'Earthsea', 'audience', 'should', 'reads', 'Ursula', 'K.', 'Le', 'Guin', 'books', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'TV', 'story.Earthsea', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'books', 'offer', 'solid', 'foundation', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'However', 'film', 'affects', 'too', 'many', 'chefs', 'audience', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'fantasy', 'experience', 'are', 'interesting', 'subplots', 'themes', 'never', 'flies', 'merely', 'standing', 'ground', 'displaying', 'monument', 'value', 'end', 'will', 'leave', 'most', 'viewers', 'disappointed', 'might', 'only', 'be', 'rental', 'recommendation', 'hardcore', 'fantasy', 'enthusiasts', 'watch', 'everything', 'alternative', 'reality']",N/A

Le Guin's ""A Wizard of Earthsea"" and ""The Tombs of Atuan"".  Seen in the light of those two books, however, ""Earthsea"" is clearly one of the very worst literary adaptations ever filmed.""Earthsea"" interweaves two storylines.  One story, the saga of the journeys, adventures and coming-of-age of the young wizard Ged (played with solemn mediocrity by Shawn Ashmore), is a somewhat unfaithful but still recognizable version of ""A Wizard of Earthsea"".  The other storyline, featuring excellent performances from ""Smallville""'s Kristin Kreuk as the young priestess Tenar and the luminous Isabella Rossellini as the high priestess Thar, is an ""adaptation"" of ""The Tombs of Atuan"" so unfaithful, both thematically and narratively, that it is virtually unrecognizable as the same story.The most controversial aspect of this movie was the casting of white actors as characters intended by Le Guin to be non-white.  In Le Guin's books, the people of most of Earthsea have skin tones in various shades of brown.  Only the barbarian Kargad islands are inhabited by white people.  Thus the casting of Ashmore and most of the rest of the actors is contrary to Le Guin's intent.  The only major cast member with dark skin is Danny Glover, who plays the wizard Ogion, the Gandalf/Merlin figure of the story -- thus neatly conforming to the Hollywood stereotype of the Magic African-American.The only performance good enough to justify this allegedly ""color-blind"" approach to casting is Chris Gauthier's wonderful portrayal of Vetch, Ged's best friend.  The scene in which Vetch and Ged tell each other their true names is so powerful that it always makes me cry, both in the book and in this disappointing movie.

877713,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00077BPA0,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[5, 10]","Early in 2004, the Sci-Fi Channel began extensive advertising for an epic TV miniseries entitled ""Legend of Earthsea"" that was allegedly based upon a series of beloved sci-fi/fantasy novels that had been written by Ursula K. Le Guin beginning in 1968.  For many months, people's expectations grew as the December, 2004 premiere night drew close; but disappointment, shock and bewilderment were what the vast majority of viewers experienced upon watching the show.  In fact, few who watched the first night of the miniseries bothered to watch the second.What made the ""Legend of Earthsea"" miniseries so awful?  First, the only resemblance between the miniseries and the ""Earthsea"" novels that Ursula K. Le Guin wrote was in name only.  Essentially, what director Robert Lieberman and writer Gavin Scott did was to create a shallow reworking of Le Guin's original stories.  Interviews with Ursula K. Le Guin indicate that neither Lieberman, Scott nor the Sci-Fi Channel was interested in consulting with her to ensure that their film adaptation was accurate.  To demonstrate just how unconnected the miniseries was from the original books, here are some (but certainly not all) of the differences:1. Ged (Shawn Ashmore) was the same age throughout the miniseries, but the novels follow him between the ages of 10 to 80.2. Ged's solitary search for understanding in the books was replaced with a hackneyed ""Lord of the Rings""-like epic, with Vetch (Chris Gauthier) taking on the role of a comic ""Samwise Gamgee"" to Ged's ""Frodo Baggins"".3. In the miniseries, Ged, Vetch, Jasper (Mark Hildreth) and the the Archmagus (Alan Scarfe) were each played by white actors; but in the books, they were all black characters.  Only Ogion (Danny Glover) was accurately portrayed.Next, the acting in the miniseries was stilted and Wooden.  Shawn Ashmore's acting was disengaging, uninspired and forced. Equally disappointing in their roles were Isabella Rossellini as ""High Priestess Thar"", Sebastian Roch&eacute; as ""King Tygath"", Kristin Kreuk as ""Tenar"" and Alan Scarfe.  Only Danny Glover was believable, though his part in the story was rather short. Of course, being a Sci-Fi Channel production, there was lots of CGI special effects throughout the miniseries; but just like so many failed sci-fi/fantasy films that predate ""Legends of Earthsea"" demonstrate, great special effects with a terrible story is still a terrible film.In the end, the attempt by the Sci-Fi Channel, Robert Lieberman and Gavin Scott to capitalize on the success of such big-screen films like the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and ""Harry Potter"" series of films by taking Ursula K. Le Guin's superb novels and replace them with a watered-down, uninspired and unrelated piece of CGI rubbish was a complete failure.  If you really want to know what the ""Earthsea"" stories are about, read Ursula K. Le Guin's original novels; but don't waste your time or money on purchasing the miniseries on DVD.  My rating for the ""Legend of Earthsea"" miniseries is an unmitigated 1 out of 5 stars.  The Sci-Fi Channel should publicly apologize to Ursula K. Le Guin for how they distorted her stories.",1,One of the Worst Adaptations of All Time,1116115200,"05 15, 2005",2005,3145,"['Early', '2004', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'began', 'extensive', 'advertising', 'epic', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'entitled', 'Legend', 'Earthsea', 'was', 'allegedly', 'based', 'series', 'beloved', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'novels', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'Ursula', 'K.', 'Le', 'Guin', 'beginning', '1968', 'many', 'months', 'people', 'expectations', 'grew', 'December', '2004', 'premiere', 'night', 'drew', 'close', 'disappointment', 'shock', 'bewilderment', 'were', 'what', 'vast', 'majority', 'viewers', 'experienced', 'watching', 'show', 'fact', 'few', 'who', 'watched', 'first', 'night', 'miniseries', 'bothered', 'watch', 'second.What', 'made', 'Legend', 'Earthsea', 'miniseries', 'so', 'awful', 'First', 'only', 'resemblance', 'miniseries', 'Earthsea', 'novels', 'Ursula', 'K.', 'Le', 'Guin', 'wrote', 'was', 'name', 'only', 'Essentially', 'what', 'director', 'Robert', 'Lieberman', 'writer', 'Gavin', 'Scott', 'did', 'was', 'create', 'shallow', 'reworking', 'Le', 'Guin', 'original', 'stories', 'Interviews', 'Ursula', 'K.', 'Le', 'Guin', 'indicate', 'Lieberman', 'Scott', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'was', 'interested', 'consulting', 'ensure', 'film', 'adaptation', 'was', 'accurate', 'demonstrate', 'just', 'how', 'unconnected', 'miniseries', 'was', 'original', 'books', 'here', 'are', 'certainly', 'not', 'differences:1', 'Ged', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'was', 'same', 'age', 'miniseries', 'novels', 'follow', 'ages', '10', '80.2', 'Ged', 'solitary', 'search', 'understanding', 'books', 'was', 'replaced', 'hackneyed', 'Lord', 'Rings', '-like', 'epic', 'Vetch', 'Chris', 'Gauthier', 'taking', 'role', 'comic', 'Samwise', 'Gamgee', 'Ged', 'Frodo', 'Baggins', '.3', 'miniseries', 'Ged', 'Vetch', 'Jasper', 'Mark', 'Hildreth', 'Archmagus', 'Alan', 'Scarfe', 'were', 'played', 'white', 'actors', 'books', 'were', 'black', 'characters', 'Only', 'Ogion', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'was', 'accurately', 'portrayed.Next', 'acting', 'miniseries', 'was', 'stilted', 'Wooden', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'acting', 'was', 'disengaging', 'uninspired', 'forced', 'Equally', 'disappointing', 'roles', 'were', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'High', 'Priestess', 'Thar', 'Sebastian', 'Roch', 'eacute', 'King', 'Tygath', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Tenar', 'Alan', 'Scarfe', 'Only', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'was', 'believable', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'rather', 'short', 'course', 'being', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'production', 'was', 'lots', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'miniseries', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'failed', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'films', 'predate', 'Legends', 'Earthsea', 'demonstrate', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'terrible', 'story', 'still', 'terrible', 'film.In', 'end', 'attempt', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'Robert', 'Lieberman', 'Gavin', 'Scott', 'capitalize', 'success', 'such', 'big-screen', 'films', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'films', 'taking', 'Ursula', 'K.', 'Le', 'Guin', 'superb', 'novels', 'replace', 'watered-down', 'uninspired', 'unrelated', 'piece', 'CGI', 'rubbish', 'was', 'complete', 'failure', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'Earthsea', 'stories', 'are', 'read', 'Ursula', 'K.', 'Le', 'Guin', 'original', 'novels', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'purchasing', 'miniseries', 'DVD', 'rating', 'Legend', 'Earthsea', 'miniseries', 'unmitigated', '1', '5', 'stars', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'should', 'publicly', 'apologize', 'Ursula', 'K.', 'Le', 'Guin', 'how', 'distorted', 'stories']",N/A

They looked to me as though someone were using state-of-the-art CGI to mimic the cheesiest special effects of thirty years ago.None of the male leads stood out or had any kind of screen presence.  I think Danny Glover is a perfectly able actor, but he was miscast here, although he was the only one who looked the part racially.  The female roles were somewhat better cast, but many of the actors looked uncomfortable speaking some of the dreadful dialog.LeGuin tells the Earthsea stories in a style that mimics, but not too closely, some of the great epics of the past, for instance the Odyssey and the Bible.  This gives it a timeless and mysterious quality and atmosphere.  The dialog writing of the movie makes the same mistake as many modern fantasy adaptions when it drops in lines that are in modern American vernacular, always painful to listen to in the context of something struggling to maintain a mythic quality.Had it not been an adaptation of the wonderful books, I would have found it somewhat interesting, but too long.

""The Lathe of Heaven"" was rendered properly once and ill the second time, and two of her ""Earthsea"" novels are mutilated in this 2004 treatment.I understand that printed page and film/video operate according to different conventions, and that absolute fidelity cannot be expected and should not be desired from the one medium to the other. Compressions, compromises, consolidations are almost inevitable, but if these are undertaken by artists who possess both technical competence and an emotional connection with the written work to be adapted, then the end product has a good chance of pleasing devotees of the source material as well as winning new converts on the basis of the new presentation alone.I grieve to add to the scores of previous reports that ""Earthsea"" fails on both counts: its deviations from the original are so extreme, and its execution so clueless and hamfisted, that it is bound to alienate anyone who esteems the original novels and unlikely to attract many fans on its slender merits alone.It is not necessary, since this has already been treated extensively in earlier reviews, to deplore in detail the ludicrous disfiguration to which the original tale has been subjected. Had the producers been given ""Casablanca"" to remake they would likely have omitted World War II as a plot element, and had Bogart chasing after an encrypted software package having to do the gene sequencing of a new strain of avian flu. That's how remote this treatment is from its source.If you'd like to see LeGuin adapted properly, there is an extant 1980 television production of ""The Lathe of Heaven"" available on DVD. The producers had a total budget of, from the looks of it, about twelve hundred dollars, and they had to render a 180-page book into less than two hours. Because the team obviously knew, loved and understood the book, and because they were just as obviously gifted, they did a magnificent job of it (better by several orders of magnitude than the 2002 remake).A couple of copy editor's nits from ""Earthsea""--poor Isabella Rossellini is twice obliged to repeat an inept screenwriter's lines. First: ""This is the weight to which I referred to,"" and second ""my successor"" used where ""my predecessor"" is obviously indicated by the context. There are also a few continuity ineptitudes, such as the protagonist's beard shrinking from a ten-day growth in one scene to a fashionable stubble in the next.Finally: one of the few elements that survived from book to television production was the ""gebbeth"": This is a foul, unclean being that eats out its victim from the inside and then assumes the outward aspect of the devoured one, thereafter preying upon others deceived the the false aspect. This describes the ""Earthsea"" DVD perfectly, and the consumer who reads this should draw the appropriate conclusion.",1,"Yes, a travesty; more aptly, a ""gebbeth""",1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,2910,"['Ms.', 'LeGuin', 'been', 'singularly', 'unfortunate', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'work', 'Lathe', 'Heaven', 'was', 'rendered', 'properly', 'once', 'ill', 'second', 'time', 'two', 'Earthsea', 'novels', 'are', 'mutilated', '2004', 'treatment.I', 'understand', 'printed', 'page', 'film/video', 'operate', 'according', 'different', 'conventions', 'absolute', 'fidelity', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'expected', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'desired', 'one', 'medium', 'other', 'Compressions', 'compromises', 'consolidations', 'are', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'are', 'undertaken', 'artists', 'who', 'possess', 'technical', 'competence', 'emotional', 'connection', 'written', 'work', 'be', 'adapted', 'then', 'end', 'product', 'good', 'chance', 'pleasing', 'devotees', 'source', 'material', 'as', 'well', 'winning', 'new', 'converts', 'basis', 'new', 'presentation', 'alone.I', 'grieve', 'add', 'scores', 'previous', 'reports', 'Earthsea', 'counts', 'deviations', 'original', 'are', 'so', 'extreme', 'execution', 'so', 'clueless', 'hamfisted', 'bound', 'alienate', 'anyone', 'who', 'original', 'novels', 'unlikely', 'attract', 'many', 'fans', 'slender', 'merits', 'alone.It', 'not', 'necessary', 'already', 'been', 'treated', 'extensively', 'earlier', 'reviews', 'deplore', 'detail', 'ludicrous', 'disfiguration', 'original', 'tale', 'been', 'subjected', 'Had', 'producers', 'been', 'given', 'Casablanca', 'remake', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'omitted', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'plot', 'element', 'had', 'Bogart', 'chasing', 'encrypted', 'software', 'package', 'having', 'do', 'gene', 'sequencing', 'new', 'strain', 'avian', 'flu', 'how', 'remote', 'treatment', 'source.If', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'LeGuin', 'adapted', 'properly', 'extant', '1980', 'television', 'production', 'Lathe', 'Heaven', 'available', 'DVD', 'producers', 'had', 'total', 'budget', 'looks', 'about', 'twelve', 'hundred', 'dollars', 'had', 'render', '180-page', 'book', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'team', 'obviously', 'knew', 'loved', 'understood', 'book', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'obviously', 'gifted', 'did', 'magnificent', 'job', 'better', 'several', 'orders', 'magnitude', '2002', 'remake', 'couple', 'copy', 'editor', 'nits', 'Earthsea', 'poor', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'twice', 'obliged', 'repeat', 'inept', 'screenwriter', 'lines', 'First', 'weight', 'referred', 'second', 'successor', 'used', 'where', 'predecessor', 'obviously', 'indicated', 'context', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'continuity', 'ineptitudes', 'such', 'protagonist', 'beard', 'shrinking', 'ten-day', 'growth', 'one', 'scene', 'fashionable', 'stubble', 'next.Finally', 'one', 'few', 'elements', 'survived', 'book', 'television', 'production', 'was', 'gebbeth', 'foul', 'unclean', 'being', 'out', 'victim', 'inside', 'then', 'outward', 'aspect', 'devoured', 'one', 'thereafter', 'preying', 'others', 'deceived', 'false', 'aspect', 'Earthsea', 'DVD', 'perfectly', 'consumer', 'who', 'should', 'draw', 'appropriate', 'conclusion']",N/A

After all, you have to change things when you do adaptations.  What got me annoyed was the TERRIBLE writing.  It was just filled with cheesy dialog and scenes that were thrown together without much thought.  One that was particulary annoying was a dismal scene in which these ships somehow manage to storm the isle of the wizards.  The mages, who can control sea and weather, and know they are coming, don't just make it so the ships can't land, capsize them, blow them back where they came from, etc.  It is like they were writing for children who would not care or even notice the sheer stupidity of parts of it.

I am a huge fan of the books and can only judge it by how well it does as a cinematic adaptation.It fails miserably.It's not just that the writers fail to get anything right beyond the names, and sometimes not even that:- ""Ged"" is the wizard's secret name, ""Sparrowhawk"" is his commonly used one- Ged and the other Archipelagans are aboriginal peoples (LeGuin says they are like the Inuit), not white- There are no girls at the school at Roke- Tenar is recognized as the incarnation of Arha when she is 5 years old; she does not take a ""test"" to become the priestess- Kossil is old and fat, not young & beautiful, and no men come near the temple- Nemmerle dies after using up all his magic after Ged summons the gebbeth, not in battle- the Kargads never attack Roke or go to war or come to Atuan during the story; the Kargad king is not in the storyThat's only a part of how wrong the scriptwriters went. But more importantly, they didn't understand what the gebbeth represented. It was Ged's own shadow side; it represented the dark side of ourselves that we all need to learn how to deal with if we are to become whole. Because they didn't understand that, they fell back on a standard-issue good vs. evil plot. Nothing we haven't seen before. The uniqueness of LeGuin's story is lost.It's a great shame that the Sci-fi folks fired the first screenwriter, Phillipa Boyens, who helped adapt ""The Lord of the Rings"" to the screen and is a LeGuin fan.

Bearing only a passing resemblance to the source material - a young wizard unleashes an evil shadow on the world while showing off his magic - the opening narration about prophecies and amulets serves fair warning that plot has become an identikit Dungeons and Dragons effort so formulaic that most small children could probably dictate the script before they can write or even walk. So little of the novels' philosophy survives, and even less of the characters or the nature of the world LeGuin created (nearly all the characters have suddenly become white-skinned Canucks) that the title seems merely there for branding reasons. Instead we get a low-budget variation on Lord of the Rings (evil warlord seeks forbidden knowledge to rule the world) while the wizards' isle of Roke has magically turned into Hogwarts without the blazers but with the obligatory obnoxious Malfoyesque villain. Worse, the changes are executed with such a visible lack of inspiration or enthusiasm that a good two-and-a-half hours of the three-hour running time feels like treading stagnant water.As if this weren't bad enough, the film is disastrously cast with some of the most uncharismatic performers available, half of whom ham it up while the other half read their lines as if off a cue card with particularly bad handwriting. Sebastian Roche's pantomime villain deserves special note for his ability to place curious emphasis on the wrong word in every line as if he's lost all interest in every sentence long before reaching the end. Danny Glover and Alan Scarfe fair somewhat better while the prominently billed Amanda Tapping (total screen time: 10 seconds, 5 of them out of focus) doesn't screw up her single line, though ""What have you done?"" isn't exactly challenging.

The usual.This has the marks about it of a made-for-TV miniseries, including startling breaks in the action, an even and plodding pace through most of its length, and a crescendo that seemed to be wedged in at the last minute and over before you realize it's supposed to be exciting. Interesting early characters are left behind like last year's gym socks, and apparent inconsistencies are brushed away when they interfere with the plot. Are those great wizards truly so inept at securing their stronghold? That suppression of wizard magic at Atuan was plenty to get in the way of a minor spell, but ineffective against the supposedly harder transformation.These are quibbles, though. It's a fair story (it's been used so many times before that you expect them to get it right), with modest but effective computer enhancement.
