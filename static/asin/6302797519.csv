335084,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,6302797519,A Customer,"[1, 3]","I wouldn't have chosen this for myself, but a friend loaned it to me because the setting is Thailand, which is where we live. It's based on the novel by Joseph Conrad. Of all the authors I read in high school, I always considered him the most boring.I haven't read this novel, however. And since it's a movie, and in Technicolor at that, why not start watching? There's no law saying I have to finish.What we quickly learn is that Peter O'Toole, eyes so blue, is a hero wanting an adventure, Lord Jim who waits for something to happen. So he joins the merchant marine in search of adventure, holding himself above the anonymous human wreckage.Idealism is contrasted with reality, using dry subtle wit. I love that.Perhaps, in hindsight, that high school class made us read as much as possible in order to destroy my love of reading. If so, it failed. Or perhaps, since the movie stayed so true to the novel, this is one of those rare cases of a novelist whose work is better as a film.The themes aren't happy here. Fear, hatred, honor, racism, trust. Until Lord Jim no longer wanted to dream at all, but only to forget. And then he moves beyond that, although it never ceases to haunt him. Lots of quotable nuggets of macho philosophy. It's a very male movie. How male? There's only one female in it, and she's billed in the credits as ""The Girl."" But fear not, she remains chaste AND does a hero turn.We see all the people that Lord Jim meets and affects as he does, through the eyes of an outsider. This gives us a realism that Conrad probably felt was missing from adventure novels. Also, when faced with the unknown, it's easier to invent racial stereotypes. They belong in the context of this book/movie, but they also fed into Hollywood's ""look at those crazy Asians"" mentality. And hey, we can even view other westerners through the lens of the stereotype. Racism, sexism, ageism, alcoholism.In the end, a very watchable movie, one that you can enjoy and think about, with a good old fashioned good vs evil war worthy of Rambo, minus the blood, and scenery that matches what I see when I look out my very own windows. I'm happy.But wait! There's more!I do enjoy a charismatic villain with screen presence. When our hero kills him off, and Conrad moves into one of the most ham-handed attempts at romance I've ever seen, the movie was only halfway over. Prequel and sequel packaged into one, with yet another charismatic villain, for 155 minutes of fun, with a good twisty plot to keep you alert.",3,Much better than I expected,1194393600,"11 7, 2007",2007,2502,"['would', ""n't"", 'have', 'chosen', 'friend', 'loaned', 'setting', 'Thailand', 'where', 'live', 'based', 'novel', 'Joseph', 'Conrad', 'authors', 'read', 'high', 'school', 'always', 'considered', 'most', 'boring.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'however', 'movie', 'Technicolor', 'why', 'not', 'start', 'watching', 'law', 'saying', 'have', 'finish.What', 'quickly', 'learn', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'eyes', 'blue', 'hero', 'wanting', 'adventure', 'Lord', 'Jim', 'who', 'something', 'happen', 'merchant', 'marine', 'search', 'adventure', 'holding', 'anonymous', 'human', 'wreckage.Idealism', 'contrasted', 'reality', 'using', 'dry', 'subtle', 'wit', 'love', 'that.Perhaps', 'hindsight', 'high', 'school', 'class', 'made', 'read', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'order', 'destroy', 'love', 'reading', 'so', 'failed', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'stayed', 'so', 'true', 'novel', 'one', 'rare', 'cases', 'novelist', 'work', 'better', 'film.The', 'themes', 'are', ""n't"", 'happy', 'here', 'Fear', 'hatred', 'honor', 'racism', 'trust', 'Lord', 'Jim', 'no', 'longer', 'wanted', 'dream', 'only', 'forget', 'then', 'never', 'haunt', 'Lots', 'quotable', 'nuggets', 'macho', 'philosophy', 'very', 'male', 'movie', 'How', 'male', 'only', 'one', 'female', 'billed', 'credits', 'Girl', 'fear', 'not', 'chaste', 'AND', 'hero', 'turn.We', 'see', 'people', 'Lord', 'Jim', 'meets', 'affects', 'eyes', 'outsider', 'realism', 'Conrad', 'probably', 'felt', 'was', 'missing', 'adventure', 'novels', 'Also', 'when', 'faced', 'unknown', 'easier', 'invent', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'belong', 'context', 'book/movie', 'also', 'fed', 'Hollywood', 'look', 'crazy', 'Asians', 'mentality', 'hey', 'can', 'even', 'view', 'other', 'westerners', 'lens', 'stereotype', 'Racism', 'sexism', 'ageism', 'end', 'very', 'watchable', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'enjoy', 'think', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'good', 'vs', 'evil', 'war', 'worthy', 'Rambo', 'minus', 'blood', 'scenery', 'what', 'see', 'when', 'look', 'out', 'very', 'own', 'windows', ""'m"", 'happy.But', 'wait', 'more', 'do', 'enjoy', 'charismatic', 'villain', 'screen', 'presence', 'When', 'hero', 'off', 'Conrad', 'one', 'most', 'ham-handed', 'attempts', 'romance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'halfway', 'Prequel', 'sequel', 'packaged', 'one', 'yet', 'charismatic', 'villain', '155', 'minutes', 'fun', 'good', 'twisty', 'plot', 'keep', 'alert']",Lord Jim VHS
335085,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,6302797519,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 1]","""Lord Jim"" is surprisingly good. It's a hybrid work. It has aspirations to be an epic in the vein ofLawrence Of Arabia. It was filmed on location in Angkor Wat and there's a hint ofEscape From Dragon Houseexotica. When traditional Cambodian music is used in the soundtrack, like the gamelan, (The Music of Cambodia, Volume 2: Royal Court Music), it's affecting. Peter O'Toole is the highlight as Jim, who lives in daydreams. Jack Hawkins (who was also in ""Lawrence"" stars as Jim's mentor, Captain Marlow. Eli Wallach stars as an evil warlord, James Mason as a gentleman pirate, and Israeli actress Daliah Levi as Jim's love interest, with whom he has credible chemistry. Unlike ""Lawrence"",the plot is complicated. Jim abandons the Patna during a storm, then spends the rest of his life running from the consequences. There's fighting between warlords and colonialists.The weaker points-The plot gets complicated, nor is it explained well. ""TE Lawrence fights the Turks to free the Arabs"" is clearer. Perhaps it was meant to convey the complexities&ambiguities; of the Vietnam War.The standard Hollywood soundtrack.The romance between Jim&the; native woman doesn't,ahem, get fleshed out. You wanted to see O'Toole give meaning to the word ""Bangkok.""Unlike TE Lawrence, who showed genuine heroism&took; action, Jim is passive that sympathetic.Stronger points-O'Toole's strong acting... and ambiguity. One moment he's macho, another he's delicate. He calls his mentor ""Daddy"",but his chemistry with the native woman is real.The use of native music- like the prayers of the Muslims on the Patna, and the gamelan.The philosophizing. It does explore deeper issues like colonialism, heroism, what integrity really is.The complexity of faith in Southeast Asia- from the Muslim prayer onboard the Patna, to the Hindu-Buddhism of Cambodia. After all, Angkor Wat combines Buddhas with Hindu divinities like Shiva.A generally good cast.""Lord Jim"" makes for interesting backstory. Dith Pran, who acted as an interpreter/cultural liaison, was profiled inThe Killing Fields. It was the first time Angkor Wat was used as a backdrop for a Hollywood movie- later, it would be inLara Croft: Tomb Raiderwith Angelina Jolie. Plus, there's the amazing music.

335088,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6302797519,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[21, 24]","I had read where another reviewer stated an apt title for this film might have been `Lawrence of Malaya' as both films feature Peter O'Toole as a man who finds himself in a foreign land, fighting against an oppressive power structure, eventually earning the respect of the native peoples, but ultimately suffering from the undeniable fact that he is a stranger, and will always be regarded as such despite whatever honor and reverence imparted upon him by those whom he helped.  Based on a novel by Joseph Conrad and written and directed by Richard Brooks (Blackboard Jungle), Lord Jim (1965) stars Peter O'Toole as the title character (although the `Lord' part isn't assigned to him until much later in the film).  Also appearing is James Mason (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea), Eli Wallach (The Magnificent Seven), Curt J&uuml;rgens (The Longest Day), Jack Hawkins (The Bridge on the River Kwai), Paul Lukas (The Lady Vanishes), Daliah Lavi (The Silencers), and Tatsuo Saito (Three Stripes in the Sun).As the story begins we witness a young British sailor named Jim graduating from sailor's school (or whatever they call it) and taking a commission on a ship commanded by Captain Marlow (Hawkins).  Jim seems a perfectly capable and able seaman, but he's also a bit of a daydreamer as thoughts of gallantry and heroic deeds swirl in his head.  After an injury leaves Jim in a foreign port, he signs on aboard the S.S. Patna, a rusty, decrepit tramp steamer carrying a mess of Muslims on a pilgrimage.  Trouble occurs at sea and the ship appears in danger of sinking, which drives the cowardly crew (Jim finds himself terror-stricken, reluctantly joining the rest of the crew) to abandon ship prematurely in one of the two meager lifeboats.  As they return to port, they're shocked to see the ship they abandoned is now in the harbor, as it was salvaged (and all passengers saved).  Driven by guilt, Jim confesses to his sins, and is shunned by his fellow British sailors, becoming a social outcast, eventually taking any job aboard any ship in an effort to escape the shameful eyes that now look upon him.  Eventually Jim finds himself in the employ of a trader named Stein (Lukas), transporting munitions to group of natives indentured to a ruthless and philosophical warlord (Wallach).  Jim manages to deliver the weapons, but soon finds himself caught up in the resistance movement, fighting alongside the natives, perhaps in an effort of redemption, as he's continually haunted and consumed by his actions of the past.  His heroism earns him a level of acceptance from the peoples, as they infer upon him the title of `Tuan', or Lord Jim out of respect.  Jim seems to have found a place in the world, but, as one would expect, the past (which he hadn't shared with his adopted peoples) comes back to haunt him in the form of a pirate named Gentleman Brown (Mason).In terms of grand epics (the film runs a hefty 2 hours and 34 minutes), I felt Lord Jim fell a little short in comparison to such films like Bridge on the River Kwai or Lawrence of Arabia.  I guess the main issue I had was it seemed O'Toole's character just seemed so distant to me.  He was sort of presented as this man-boy, caught up in dreams of grandeur, yet mired within his own limitations and fears, subsequently haunted by a past he can't escape.  I think he turned in a very good performance, but I just had a problem connecting with his character and so his cause never really became my cause.  This lack of connection prevented me from investing too much of myself within the film, and often made me reflect on Hollywood's general inability to properly relate source material to the silver screen.  Perhaps this stems from the fact that some novels just aren't adaptable to film (but then I used to think that of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels, and they turned out pretty well).  At times I thought the film was really wonderful, and had clear direction, but then other times it seemed a little disjointed.  I did enjoy Wallach's performance as The General as he was presented as cunning and thoughtful villain, instead of just a two-dimensional antagonist element used to drive the story.  I thought James Mason did exceptionally well as Gentleman Brown, understanding Jim's weakness so perfectly and using it to his advantage.  I especially like how he was introduced, described by another character as a man that `has given more people to death than the Bubonic Plague.  He's wanted from Madagascar to Hong Kong for piracy, slaving, mutiny, murder, arson, rape, and some things that aren't even mentioned in the Bible.'  After a build up like that, I could hardly wait to see the character, and I wasn't disappointed.  I did feel some of the supporting parts, especially the natives, seemed a bit weak and watered down, and existed not so much as real, supportive characters, but more as plot contrivances (I also felt this of the character of Stein, especially with the sort of creepy father-son relationship he had with Jim).  The in-depth and extended examination of the differences between one being a coward versus being a hero seemed a bit murky at times, and the concepts a little indigestible, but I think this has more to due with variances with regards to the source material.  All in all a sweeping and entertaining film with a compelling heart and excellent production values that fell a little short of being a masterpiece, but not for lack of trying.The widescreen anamorphic (2.20:1) picture on this DVD looks decent, but some of the colors didn't seem as sharp as I felt they could have been.  The Dolby Digital 3.0 audio is acceptable, and generally clear and distinct.  Extras include a preview section featuring trailers for Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on the River Kwai, and In Cold Blood.Cookieman108",4,"""Always he wants to be what he is not.""",1112313600,"04 1,

335089,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,6302797519,Cowboy Buddha,"[36, 40]","Well, Peter O'Toole was never going to find another character or film as magnificent as Lawrence of Arabia. And his first films after that triumph were commendable attempts to avoid typecasting - What's New Pussycat and Becket. But it was inevitable he would again become a tormented blonde Englishman in an alien environment. And he could have done a lot worse than starring as Lord Jim for Richard Brooks.Any discussion of this film has to concentrate on O'Toole and Brooks. That is not to say there are no other impressive performances, or that the film is not beautifully photographed or graced with a lushly evocative score. But the film is Brooks' vision and O'Toole is the one who must bring it to life. They are both reasonably successful.Brooks obviously wanted to create an intelligent epic -one to rival the Robert Bolt/David Lean collaborations. But Brooks was both writer and director - and he was adapting a book that was as pyschological as potentially visual. Luckily for him, audiences in the 1960's were more sophisticated (dare we say intelligent?) and willing to think about what they were watching than today's consumers of assembly-line disposable entertainment. So characters could discuss and debate as well as blow things up. Although the disjointed nature of some of the film suggests pre-release studio interference. In the end, the film is a commendable attempt - perhaps more worthy than enjoyable, but still with lots to hold the viewer's interest.The southeast Asian locations are frequently spectacular and some sequences - the storm at sea and the final battle with pirates - are excitedly staged. The film always looks and sounds beautiful. And, for once, an international cast with various accents actually contributes to the flavor of the script and characters. Stalwart Jack Hawkins, industrious Paul Lukas, wily Eli Wallach (doing a variation on his Magnificent Seven bandit) and James Mason seemingly enjoying himself as a gentleman pirate. The ""native"" players are also unusually good. Only gorgeous Daliah Lavi occasionally seems out of place, looking more like a 60's dolly bird than an exotic maiden.But, of course, it is Peter O'Toole who commands the greatest attention. He is seldom off the screen and is probably the main reason for viewing the film today. He is properly enigmatic although without the multiple layers of Lawrence. This may well be the only film in which O'Toole occasionally underacts. After all these years, I still remember the Mad Magazine parody of Lord Jim. Two extras keep asking which emotion O'Toole is displaying - anger, love, determination, fear, doubt.

I did get what the story was about, and that was about a man who needed a second chance to redeem himself after he blew it the first time around. The film stars Peter O' Toole as the main character of Lord Jim, and he was an officer in the British Navy, and he would end up being disgraced as a coward during a hurricane he instead of saving the passengers jumps with the rest of the crew. After being ousted by the British Navy he wanders for a period of time, and then fate brings him to an island that he's trying to open a trade route to, and he ends up leading a coup as a group of islanders(not New York mind you) are fighting against a corrupt group of pirates to bring law and order to their land, or so that's what I got out of the movie, and Lord Jim pays the ultimate price.

Because it's very hard to capture Conrad's psychology of the main character, Jim, onto the big screen.  O'Toole comes very close in a very under-stated performance which ranks as one of his most under-rated in comparison to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" where he was much more flamboyant.  Here he displays his angst and deep disgust at himself for failing at a crucial moment in his life.  Richard Brooks is not David Lean but he is still a very good director and he stages the battle scenes effectively plus utilizing the Super-Panavision scope very well (I did manage to see a rare but badly discolored 70mm print of this film in Hollywood).

He sets out in the hope of gaining a new life and ends up fighting smugglers and pirates in a desperate bid to forget his past.  James Mason, Eli Wallach, and Curt Jurgens play baddies and Jack Hawkins is the officer who sympathizes with Jim.  Is it too late for redemption and love, or will Jim prove a coward once again?Violent ContentThe film includes many skirmishes and battles between natives and money hungry gun-runners.  Men are dispatched in many ways.  The natives throw spears.  Due to the fact that this is a sixties movie, the spears always pass under the persons arm or never actually pierce skin.  There is a lot of shooting.  A few people get strangled.  There are a few kick-boxing matches, and a man is slashed with a machete.The most disturbing scene of violence is saved for Jim himself.  He is tortured by bandits (mostly off-screen, but we see the build-up and the aftermath) and we watch his face as he screams in pain.  The scene is rather tame by todays standards, but some kids will be frightened.Sexual ContentMen are shown shirtless throughout the film.  Jim is shown swimming with naked children.  After torture fails, Eli Wallach's character pushes a beautiful woman in front of Jim, telling him that he may make love to her for the next hour.  He then forcibly rips open her shirt exposing her to Jim (we see her back and then her shoulders from the front, but no real nudity).  Jim refuses Wallach's offer, but later admits to the woman that he ""desired her"".LanguageTerms such as ""damned"" and ""damnation"" are used in context, and hell is briefly referenced.MoralesJim's morales are slightly amibiguous.  Many of the characters in the film seem to have a basic belief in a god of some kind.  Muslims are portrayed in a positive light.  Jim's search for redemption is the focal point of the story.  He refuses to sell out the natives despite being tortured.  Jim desires that ""God give him a second chance.""Lord Jim is based on a classic novel by Joseph Conrad.  It might have been better for the film if it had not been.  The film is too slow to be a good action movie, and has too much action to be a good thought-provoking film.  It follows the books plot loosely at best and for the most part, strays completely from it.  Peter O'Toole, James Mason and company all give good performances, there are some good scenes, and the action is well-handled, but over-all the film is lacking and will probably go down as a cheap imitation of Lawrence of Arabia.  The film is the equivalent of a modern PG-13, and will probably not offend most people, but is likely to bore little kids, teenagers, and many adults.  Plus, the dvd is VERY expensive.

Filmed in Super Panavasion 70 on locations in South East Asia, the film looks breathtaking in this excellent DVD transfer that has been remastered in high definition.  Jack Hawkins narrates as well as appears (sadly, after he had had operations for throat cancer so his rich voice has lost some of its magic) and just when you think the story is reaching a conclusion, James Mason turns up for another chapter.  Bronislau Kaper's music score is one of the greats (also including lots of Asian gamelan instruments) and decades ago was a collector's item LP.  This anamorphic transfer recreates the visual impact of the film's initial theatrical release and the Dolby Digital sound is knockout.

335110,A11ZZ2732YTISO,6302797519,The Bruce,"[4, 4]","The key to enjoying Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim on screen is accepting the hero's personal standard at face value: ""if I lose without honor, then everything will have been for nothing."" We in the West often think of winning, often at all costs, and so to win with honor seems a noble goal. But what of losing without honor? Dramatizing this theme is what distinguishes this movie from practically every other film to come out of Hollywood. And Peter O'Toole's character enunciates this credo explicitly at the end of the movie, as he explains his decision not to run away from the consequences of his actions a second time.The movie was beautifully photographed in Southeast Asia, the screenplay is articulate yet concise, and the acting is uniformly superb. Aside from O'Toole's subtle performance are first-rate contributions from Paul Lukas as the elderly trader who plays a father surrogate role to O'Toole's Jim, an understated Dalia Lavi as his love interest, Eli Wallach enjoying himself as a local warlord, and James Mason almost delectable as an English pirate. Often overlooked is Curt Jurgens, who turns in a quiet but powerful character study of a drunk filled with self-loathing, someone who foreshadows what Lord Jim would have been transformed into had he chose to run away.This is one of the last great films from Hollywood's heyday.",5,A life without honor is no life at all,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,1346,"['key', 'enjoying', 'Joseph', 'Conrad', 'Lord', 'Jim', 'screen', 'accepting', 'hero', 'personal', 'standard', 'face', 'value', 'lose', 'honor', 'then', 'everything', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'nothing', 'West', 'often', 'think', 'winning', 'often', 'costs', 'so', 'win', 'honor', 'noble', 'goal', 'what', 'losing', 'honor', 'Dramatizing', 'theme', 'what', 'movie', 'practically', 'other', 'film', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'character', 'credo', 'explicitly', 'end', 'movie', 'decision', 'not', 'run', 'away', 'consequences', 'actions', 'second', 'time.The', 'movie', 'was', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'screenplay', 'articulate', 'yet', 'concise', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'superb', 'Aside', ""O'Toole"", 'subtle', 'performance', 'are', 'first-rate', 'contributions', 'Paul', 'Lukas', 'elderly', 'trader', 'who', 'father', 'surrogate', 'role', ""O'Toole"", 'Jim', 'understated', 'Dalia', 'Lavi', 'love', 'interest', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'enjoying', 'local', 'warlord', 'James', 'Mason', 'almost', 'delectable', 'English', 'pirate', 'Often', 'overlooked', 'Curt', 'Jurgens', 'who', 'quiet', 'powerful', 'character', 'study', 'drunk', 'filled', 'self-loathing', 'someone', 'who', 'what', 'Lord', 'Jim', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'transformed', 'had', 'chose', 'run', 'away.This', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'heyday']",Lord Jim VHS
