Great story, interesting characters, superb photography all centered around ""nuggets"" learning to fly the late, great, and much missed F-14.  Given the struggle the producers and to get this to the public, thank goodness they persevered.  You can't go wrong with this film, as so many other reviews will attest.One note:  Although the price difference between the DVD and the Blu Ray version has narrowed, the DVD is the better buy.  The Blu Ray version's quality is only marginally superior to the DVD,especially on an upscaling player, possibly because the producers had to expend so much to get it distributed at all that they didn't enough funds left to do a proper HiDef version.  So get the DVD.  You'll save a couple of bucks, still have this magnificent production, and you'll be able to show it on any DVD or Blu Ray player.",5,Possibly the best aviation documentary ever made,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,866,"['ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'praised', 'too', 'much', 'Great', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'superb', 'photography', 'centered', 'nuggets', 'learning', 'fly', 'late', 'great', 'much', 'missed', 'F-14', 'Given', 'struggle', 'producers', 'get', 'public', 'thank', 'goodness', 'persevered', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'will', 'attest.One', 'note', 'price', 'difference', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'narrowed', 'DVD', 'better', 'buy', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'quality', 'only', 'marginally', 'superior', 'DVD', 'especially', 'upscaling', 'player', 'possibly', 'producers', 'had', 'expend', 'so', 'much', 'get', 'distributed', 'did', ""n't"", 'enough', 'funds', 'left', 'do', 'proper', 'HiDef', 'version', 'get', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'save', 'couple', 'bucks', 'still', 'have', 'magnificent', 'production', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'show', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'player']",Speed & Angels Game

1169883,AI5OR1HSYXCCL,B001B187CU,Steve  Dietrich,"[2, 2]","I saw the preview in a theater at the recommendation of one of my grad students who had flown the F-14.The audience reaction was interesting in that both the men and women attending seemed to enjoy the film equally. A very rare case of a movie capturing the challenge of military flying.  Very good job of binding both the human story and great flying scenes into a documentary where the drama is not manufactured.A great chic flick in that one of the two pilots followed is a young woman of exceptional talent.The film follows two pilots through their transitioning training into the F-14 community. For those not familiar with the airplane the F-14 is big, fast and intolerant of neglect on the part of the pilot.The air to air photography is stunning.Highly recommended, I bought the cd for friends to share. Initial reactions from non pilots are very positive.",5,THE REAL DEAL,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,864,"['saw', 'preview', 'theater', 'recommendation', 'one', 'grad', 'students', 'who', 'had', 'flown', 'F-14.The', 'audience', 'reaction', 'was', 'interesting', 'men', 'women', 'attending', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'film', 'equally', 'very', 'rare', 'case', 'movie', 'capturing', 'challenge', 'military', 'flying', 'Very', 'good', 'job', 'binding', 'human', 'story', 'great', 'flying', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'where', 'drama', 'not', 'manufactured.A', 'great', 'chic', 'flick', 'one', 'two', 'pilots', 'followed', 'young', 'woman', 'exceptional', 'talent.The', 'film', 'two', 'pilots', 'transitioning', 'training', 'F-14', 'community', 'not', 'familiar', 'airplane', 'F-14', 'big', 'fast', 'intolerant', 'neglect', 'part', 'pilot.The', 'air', 'air', 'photography', 'stunning.Highly', 'recommended', 'bought', 'cd', 'friends', 'share', 'Initial', 'reactions', 'non', 'pilots', 'are', 'very', 'positive']",Speed & Angels Game
