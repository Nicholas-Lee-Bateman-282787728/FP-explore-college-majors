There is no one BEST performance in the lot.  They are all BEST performances because when this man went before the camera, he always gave it his all...his personal best.  He always understood who he was portraying and shaded his characters with nuances that only an intimate of that character might be aware of. I usually hesitate on collections of any kind because they normally throw in a clunker you wouldn't buy otherwise...but not so with Kirk Douglas.  All you can wish for is more of the same and he shines in everything he does! The extra added fourth attraction of having him speak about himself as he is today is more than I could have asked for.",5,Three Of HIs Best Roles + A Real Bonus,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,875,"['have', 'always', 'adored', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'give', 'even', '34', 'iffy', '34', 'performance', 'collection', 'stunning', 'talents', 'different', 'points', 'stellar', 'career', 'one', 'BEST', 'performance', 'lot', 'are', 'BEST', 'performances', 'because', 'when', 'man', 'went', 'camera', 'always', 'gave', 'personal', 'best', 'always', 'understood', 'who', 'was', 'portraying', 'shaded', 'characters', 'nuances', 'only', 'intimate', 'character', 'might', 'be', 'aware', 'usually', 'hesitate', 'collections', 'kind', 'normally', 'throw', 'clunker', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'otherwise', 'not', 'so', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'can', 'wish', 'more', 'same', 'everything', 'extra', 'added', 'fourth', 'attraction', 'having', 'speak', 'about', 'today', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'asked']",N/A
1544831,A84TOOCIEF6FX,B0082SICCU,David Webb,"[8, 10]","Kirk Douglas has been one of my heroes for decades. His acting had a visceral quality that sought the heart and soul of the characters he portrayed. This compilation contains some of his best works from his early career. His rendition of Vincent van Gogh in ""Lust for Life"" is beyond memorable. However, the real bonus is ""Before I Forget"", a one man show in which he recalls memories that shaped him as a person. While Kirk is most remembered as a dramatic actor, he has a terrific sense of humor that comes out in his live performance. His film of Spartacus (not included) is probably the best Epic film of all time because it dealt with slavery at the apogee of the Civil Rights revolution. He broke the insidious Hollywood Black List by crediting Dalton Trumbo as the screen writer for this important film.",5,Unforgetable Films and Live Performance,1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,810,"['Kirk', 'Douglas', 'been', 'one', 'heroes', 'decades', 'acting', 'had', 'visceral', 'quality', 'sought', 'heart', 'soul', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'compilation', 'best', 'works', 'early', 'career', 'rendition', 'Vincent', 'van', 'Gogh', 'Lust', 'Life', 'memorable', 'However', 'real', 'bonus', 'Forget', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'memories', 'shaped', 'person', 'Kirk', 'most', 'remembered', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'terrific', 'sense', 'humor', 'out', 'live', 'performance', 'film', 'Spartacus', 'not', 'included', 'probably', 'best', 'Epic', 'film', 'time', 'slavery', 'apogee', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'revolution', 'broke', 'insidious', 'Hollywood', 'Black', 'List', 'crediting', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'screen', 'writer', 'important', 'film']",N/A

While I have never warmed to Douglas as an actor the way I have say with Bogart or Mitchum, there is no denying he made so fabulous movies. His stock in trade was intensity but he was able to channel in with amazing results as you seen in these two great movies which make this set worth buying just for these two titles. Gorgeous prints as well. The other titles are a matter of taste dabbling as they do in sentimentality and ego.",5,Lust for Life and The bad and the Beautiful are undeniable Hollywood masterpieces of the ...,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,528,"['Lust', 'Life', 'bad', 'Beautiful', 'are', 'undeniable', 'Hollywood', 'masterpieces', '1950s', 'have', 'never', 'warmed', 'Douglas', 'actor', 'way', 'have', 'say', 'Bogart', 'Mitchum', 'denying', 'made', 'so', 'fabulous', 'movies', 'stock', 'trade', 'was', 'intensity', 'was', 'able', 'channel', 'amazing', 'results', 'seen', 'two', 'great', 'movies', 'make', 'set', 'worth', 'buying', 'just', 'two', 'titles', 'Gorgeous', 'prints', 'well', 'other', 'titles', 'are', 'matter', 'taste', 'dabbling', 'do', 'sentimentality', 'ego']",N/A
