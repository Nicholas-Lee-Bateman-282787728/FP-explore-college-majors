He re-occurs every now and again, but a great deal of the movie focuses on his family, even more so than on his (eventual) love interest.  If a viewer were to fast forward the film every time Sasha disappeared, its length would be cut to a third.Specifically to address one of the early gay elements...perusing gay porn magazines, taking one, trying to hide it from his family, eventually having it found...is an element filmed so frequently as to have become a clich&eacute;.

1405282,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B004FSXRMQ,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[5, 11]","........or is that Shakespeare?Here's my ""Brief-Take"" on this 2010 production from Germany:-- Hiding under this movie's fairly tumultuous family tale is: ""A not-much-screen-time, guy / guy love story.""  Strangely, it's a work quite similar to a 2002 Spanish / German production, ""Food of Love""  Both films involve a young concert pianist-in-training (Sasha / Paul) and his male, concert piano performer / teacher.  While there are ""falling in love"" similarities in these two movies, here are some DIFFERENCES---The older film's near-neurotic and more self-serving, clingy mother vs. this film's selflessly supportive....but sometimes pushy one.  2002's pretty much out of the picture father vs. Sasha's boorish, know-it-all example of what fatherhood should NOT be (despite an end of film attempt to transform this s---head of a man in our eyes).  Oh, and thrown into the film mix for ""Sasha"" is a sometimes funny uncle and a sometimes supportive / sometimes jealously competitive younger brother.  In other words, we're given a whole family of characters this viewer considers as receiving way too much screen time.....while we're being shown little of the title character trying to find his way in love and in life (Hey, this is a film titled ""Sasha"".....is it not?).  To end this two film comparison, while ""Food of Love"" is a film shot in a much more technically accomplished manner, with characters occupying the opposite social class from those inhabiting ""Sasha,"" what it lacks, BIGTIME, is an actor with presence in the lead role.....one we can actually see Grow his character (Sasha's portrayer acts circles around his counterpart in the older film).-- Despite any other negatives associated with the current production, know this:  The actor (Sascha Kekez) portraying ""Sasha"" quickly and easily makes his way into our hearts......and we readily accept him.  Unlike other aspects of the film, this young man easily deserves an 4-Star rating on his own (I predict a bright future).-- Love scene-wise, we are given Hot--Hot kissing shots.  Yet....bed scene-wise, you'll see only above-the-briefs nudity and more of the Hot kissing.  Lack of full body nudity seems strange, coming from these sexually open countries.-- Color and lighting cinematography are sometimes a problem.....with overbright shots and a few near-monotone color scenes intruding on what is otherwise a fairly well camera-managed production.-- Lastly.....and most importantly, your reviewer has this question to ask after watching the closing scene:  What ""Just out of the closet Newbie.....Canoeing on the local river and spotting a certain someone's 'interesting' Ex-partner (who, himself, is ogling).....Is going to very soon be revisiting the area's indoor swimming pool?""  (See this scene for yourself.....there are enough involving just Sasha's activities to make this worth a rental).-- Happy Trolling, Sasha!!PS--Have fun, Viewers, with an initial scene set in a......Magazine Shop (that's right, you got it.....think 1996's ""Beautiful Thing"").

1405283,A1PZ79C82KLNFQ,B004FSXRMQ,Lawrence Oei,"[1, 1]","My take on why coming out stories are mostly traumatic is really simple : we strive to belong to this entity called mankind and feel like freaks because we can't conform, because we don't feel and respond sexually to what ""normal"" people do so, we mask our pain under a shroud of pretense until we either implode or explode. I think the latter is preferable because implosion usually means self-destruction. This brilliant movie is about explosion - an impressionable and naive young gay men refusing to deny his sexuality and broken by unrequited love fumbles through a series of actions that leads to an explosive outcome : his family's eventual acceptance of his sexual orientation and his acceptance that the object of his crush was nothing if not unworthy of his devotion.An excellent movie worth watching, if for nothing else, for its message of hope and the stunning performances of its talented cast.",4,A brilliant coming out story with a hopeful ending,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,908,"['take', 'why', 'coming', 'out', 'stories', 'are', 'mostly', 'traumatic', 'really', 'simple', 'strive', 'belong', 'entity', 'called', 'mankind', 'feel', 'freaks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'conform', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'respond', 'sexually', 'what', 'normal', 'people', 'do', 'so', 'mask', 'pain', 'shroud', 'pretense', 'implode', 'explode', 'think', 'latter', 'preferable', 'implosion', 'usually', 'self-destruction', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'explosion', 'impressionable', 'naive', 'young', 'gay', 'men', 'refusing', 'deny', 'sexuality', 'broken', 'unrequited', 'love', 'fumbles', 'series', 'actions', 'explosive', 'outcome', 'family', 'eventual', 'acceptance', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'acceptance', 'object', 'crush', 'was', 'nothing', 'not', 'unworthy', 'devotion.An', 'excellent', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'nothing', 'else', 'message', 'hope', 'stunning', 'performances', 'talented', 'cast']",Sasha

We observe the clash of two different cultures, two different worlds. On one side there is the generation of young immigrants, who managed to adopt the western standards, on the other, their parents (the best friend of Sasha comes from China), whose mentality and beliefs remain untouched by the German (western) culture. Until...I am happy I bought this dvd, because I really enjoyed the film. Acting is really good (Sasha Kekez is constantly luring the viewers' attention). We can see again Tim Bergmann as a gay musician/teacher (don't miss his performance in very entertaining ""Regular guys"").There are some extras on the dvd (deleted scenes and behind the scenes).

1405285,A1ADZQOL0PLBEW,B004FSXRMQ,Scadhog,"[5, 5]","Bittersweet film touching on many topics:  adolescent coming out, homophobia, family dynamics, cultural clash, and unrequited love.  The story is simple.  A young man, Sasha (Sasa Kekez) falls in love with an older man, Gebhart (Tim Bergmann), who doesn't return his love.There are several very moving scenes.  Two serve as bookends to the film.  Early on Sasha reveals to his female best friend that he is gay.  Unfortunately she thinks his big announcement is that he is in love with her.  Her hurt and sense of betrayal are eloquently expressed.  Sadder is the scene, that takes place the morning after Sasha spends the night with Gebhart.  He prattles on about their relationship while he is getting his breakfast.  Gebhart, for whom this was only a one night stand, clearly regrets what he has done and  grows more and more uncomfortable,  finally lashing out at Sasha, revealing his lack of feelings for him.  It is a particularly moving scene for anyone who has experienced rejection by the object of his affection.Another very well done scene occurs at the end, when Gebhart, almost a victim of Sasha's father's rage, abandons Sasha just when he needs him most, showing his essential shallowness and coldness.  He wanders off in a hazy, sunlit glare, perhaps symbolic of his leaving Sasha behind forever.The actors are uniformly excellent, especially Kekez and Bergmann.  Predrag Bjelac is suitably menacing as Sasha's father.  Zeljka Preksavec as his subservient, yet domineering mother is also noteworthy.The only real flaw is the ending.  The reconciliation that takes place seems rather forced, tacked on to give the film a happy ending.  Of course, a lot of people might prefer it that way.I originally gave this one 4 stars, mainly due to the ending, but 4-1/2 would be more appropriate.

1405286,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B004FSXRMQ,Tommy Dooley,"[3, 3]","This is the story of Sasha (Sascha Kekez) who is living in Germany having left Montenegro. His mother has pushed him to become a virtuoso of the piano and has worked extra hard for his private piano lessons. His father still has both feet placed in the macho centric society of Montenegro and would rather see his son exceeding at something more manly, like swimming or street fighting. Still Sasha's piano lessons are not wasted money as far as he is concerned as he not only gets to `tinkle the ivories' but also to indulge his crush on his piano teacher - self centred gay man about town Gebhard Weber ( Tim Bergmann).Sasha also has a best friend in Chinese, voiln playing Jiao, although she rather fancies him and has been bemused by his reticence in coming on to her. All is soon revealed when Herr Weber decides he is leaving town for ever and a grief stricken Sasha tells her everything. Sashas' Dad thinks Jiao is also the girlfriend of Sasha but things take an awkward turn when his brother Boki takes a liking for Jiao and she don't say no.This is just a beautiful film, when I read the synopsis I thought it was going to be one of those films that tries to be a bit arty in the deconstruct of modern relationships versus old country ways, and in many ways it is, but it is the way in which this is done that makes this so special.Writer and director Dennis Todorovic has got the balance right on absolutely every single level. There is humour, understanding and sympathy for all the characters, and that is very rare indeed, Even though the story is about Sasha we get to feel how all of the people involved have a part to play and how acceptance can be painful for both sides when faced with a son coming out. It can be hard for so called modern parents, but coming from a more conservative background makes it infinitesimally harder.  I mean his father won't even tolerate Boki having a tattoo, on his arm much less another bloke.Not really a bedroom film, but there is a lot of passion, most of it pent up though. There is not a single bad performance and this is up there with my favourite German gay film, `Summer Storm'Summer Storm, it really is that good. It is in German and Montenegrin (sorry not sure what actual language that is) and with good sub titles, this is one I have rented and have now ordered it to own as it is one I want to share with friends and would love to see again.
