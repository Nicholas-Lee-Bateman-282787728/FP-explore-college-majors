236964,A18BB57HXG08E6,6300270904,"Arissa ""Arissa""","[0, 0]","This is an old fashioned enjoyable yarn of the people who come together in the dying days of a grand old hotel in New Orleans, set during the early civil rights movement.  It is fun soap opera, starring Rod Taylor as the earnest, honest man who runs the hotel for his kindly, aging but behind the times boss.  The hotel is under threat of being bought out by the owner of a chain of hotels who wants to turn the elegant St. Gregory into another link in the chain.  Of course, he has a lovely, unhappy young mistress who takes to Taylor.  The other principals are the wonderful Michael Rennie as an English duke, haunted by a tragedy and the superb and still beautiful Merle Oberon as his ambitious, scheming wife, Karl Malden as comic relief as a hotel thief, lots of jazz and glimpses of the French Quarter.  Racial politics of the time thread through: the kindly old hotel owner will not desegregate his hotel, despite Taylor's awareness that this must be done.  The film dodges the issue of whether Taylor's character believes this is the moral or simply pragmatic thing to do; one senses it is the former, but while the film touches on this issue, it doesn't honestly handle it.I am a Rod Taylor fan, which is one of the reasons I enjoy this film.  Rennie and Oberon also make it worth watching.  So don't expect much, but if you enjoy B level dramas from that era, this is a pleasant one.  There is very little action, but the character takes seem to carry the tale along.",4,"For fans of Taylor, Rennie and Oberon",1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,1477,"['old', 'fashioned', 'enjoyable', 'yarn', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'together', 'dying', 'days', 'grand', 'old', 'hotel', 'New', 'Orleans', 'set', 'early', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'fun', 'soap', 'opera', 'starring', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'earnest', 'honest', 'man', 'who', 'hotel', 'kindly', 'aging', 'times', 'boss', 'hotel', 'threat', 'being', 'bought', 'out', 'owner', 'chain', 'hotels', 'who', 'turn', 'elegant', 'St.', 'Gregory', 'link', 'chain', 'course', 'lovely', 'unhappy', 'young', 'mistress', 'who', 'Taylor', 'other', 'principals', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'English', 'duke', 'haunted', 'tragedy', 'superb', 'still', 'beautiful', 'Merle', 'Oberon', 'ambitious', 'scheming', 'wife', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'comic', 'relief', 'hotel', 'thief', 'lots', 'jazz', 'glimpses', 'French', 'Quarter', 'Racial', 'politics', 'time', 'thread', 'kindly', 'old', 'hotel', 'owner', 'will', 'not', 'desegregate', 'hotel', 'Taylor', 'awareness', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'film', 'issue', 'Taylor', 'character', 'moral', 'simply', 'pragmatic', 'thing', 'do', 'one', 'former', 'film', 'touches', 'issue', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'handle', 'it.I', 'am', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'fan', 'one', 'reasons', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Rennie', 'Oberon', 'also', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'enjoy', 'B', 'level', 'dramas', 'era', 'pleasant', 'one', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'character', 'seem', 'carry', 'tale']",N/A

The vindictive Hotel Mogul play by Kevin McCarthy, there to try to buy the St. Gregory to turn it into a tourist trap, his French Gal Pal, played by Catherine Spaak, who falls for Taylors character and one my favorites, Karl Malden as the hotel thief.  You would think that a movie about an aging New Orleans hotel would drag and have slow spots, but this movie keeps the pace going and is very watchable.

236980,A2KNX6Y72E1FVJ,6300270904,"V. Risoli ""black farmer""","[1, 1]","As Judith Crist called ""Airport"" upon its release in 1970, ""the best film of 1944,"" 1967's ""Hotel"" also based on a novel by Arthur Hailey, is indeed old-fashioned in its presentation.  The best-seller it was based on, in a style called an ""omnibus"" probably dates back even before the sensation of 1932's ""Grand Hotel"" wherein a cast of big name actors play inhabitants involved in the machinations of a bigger entity providing even more drama to its latest catastrophe.  With ""Airport"" it heralded the advent of the disaster film which usually utilized this same plot construction.  Involved in 1967's ""Hotel"" are Rod Taylor, Catherine Spaak, Merle Oberon, Kevin McCarthy, Melvyn Douglas, Karl Malden, Richard Conte and Michael Rennie, but there is a more slight catastrophe, the oncoming closing of the hotel due to changing times and possibly its demolition.  Directed by Richard Quine who also brought us ""How to Murder Your Wife"" and ""Synanon"" handled it well and the screenplay by Wendell Mayes was also very good, as usual (he wrote the scripts for Otto Preminger's ""Anatomy of a Murder,"" ""Advise and Consent"" and ""In Harm's Way,"" all the deftly handled scripting of a bestselling book).  The original score by Johnny Keating is very beautiful  and haunting in a somewhat conventional style as well, featuring the songs ""This Year"" and the theme from ""Hotel"" both of which are sung by Carmen MacRae (who is featured in the film), although I was dismayed she did not sing the theme for ""Hotel"" in the film (see my review of the soundtrack CD).  Catherine Spaak is one of those odd happenings why she was considered a sex bomb starlet in the sixties, mostly in European imports like Roger Vadim's ""The Circle of Love"" (here in the U.S., but ""La Ronde"" (the re-make) in Europe); ""The Empty Canvas"" and ""The Little Nuns""), but she did cross into U.S. films in things like ""Hotel"" and ""Weekend at Dunkirk.""  Today she is probably best known for the female lead in Dario Argento's ""Cat o Nine Tails.""  Rod Taylor was never sexier (which he could be, surprisingly) and it featured one of the last roles Merle Oberon had before retiring her supreme beauty from our sights.  In some reviews, Karl Malden is claimed to be a scene stealer, but I found him to be humorous, but lacking the guile of evil-intent to play a criminal as the hotel thief, so I thought he was somewhat mis-cast.  But the film is rather sumptuous, as the beautiful color, beautifully transferred by Warner Archive here, the decor, the music all begin to unravel for an entertaining viewing.  Critics also said Hailey's plot mechanics were re-hashes of old plots as there is nothing really new here as there was to come in ""Airport.""
