The movie is about family life and a family surviving failure in the sense of being unfaithful. It has very good moral content and focuses on situations in current society.,5,sappy but good,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,266,"['have', 'write', '20', 'words', 'movie', 'like', 'sappy', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'movie', 'family', 'life', 'family', 'surviving', 'failure', 'sense', 'being', 'unfaithful', 'very', 'good', 'moral', 'content', 'focuses', 'situations', 'current', 'society']",Comeback Season
1032967,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000KB48A2,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 6]","I enjoyed this film.  While it may not be classic, it has great moments.  Bruce McCulloch, who directed the light comedies ""Stealing Harvard"" & ""Superstar,"" keeps the pace brisk.  Ray Liotta, who won an Emmy for ""ER"" in 2005, plays Walter Pearce.  Walter seems to be a rather weak man.  With a marriage that has gone stale, he gives into temptation with a young assistant at his firm.  His daughter Chloe goes to dinner with her family and her boyfriend Paul.  Chloe is played by the lovely Rachel Blanchard who was in ""Snakes on a Plane.""  Paul is played by Brenden Fehr who was a regular on the TV series ""Roswell.""  On the heels of Paul & Chloe's engagement, Walter feels compelled to confess at the worst possible time that he has strayed.  His wife Deborah played by Glenne Headley who was inThe Amateursbegins to punish him in every way possible, which is the premise for all that follows.  The other daughter Christine is played by Brooke Nevin who I enjoyed as Nikki Hudson on TV's ""4400.""  She had her heart broken by star high school football player Skylar.  Walter winds up crashing at Skylar's house, next door to his family.  As Skylar, Shaun Sipos is a bright spot in the film.  Looking like he could play a cousin to Brad Pitt, he must endure a big change in his life and learn how to be kind.  The ""buddy movie"" aspect of the film greatly appealed to me.  Ron Selmour, who will be in ""2012"" currently being advertised in theatres, has a nice cameo as the yoga teacher Ranja who tries to do more than teach.  Overall, this is a feel-good movie that leaves you with a smile on your face and a warm spot in the heart.

Abrams ""Matty126""","[4, 5]","I personally found this movie very good, it had a good story and I didnt find the acting bad at all considering the type of movie it was. I thought Ray Liotta did a good job with this role. Ray is one of my favorite actors and while he excells in movies like Goodfellas, Unlawful Entry, Hannibal, Smokin Aces, Copland,John Q, Steet Kings 2 Motor City and others like it, This movie proves he can act in any role hes trying to portray.
