Schulz ""Julian""","[12, 13]","Purchasing this DVD, the subject matter seemed intriguing, but i had low expectations, overall.However, after viewing, i came away extremely impressed with the film & 8th grade films.The footage of Todd Youth in his Hell's kitchen (literally), and Dick Manitoba were worth the price alone, yet this well paced & thought out documentary provided so much more.The rivalry between two top KISS tribute bands was fascinating & mirrored the fractured relationships in the actual KISS.Ace Frehley fanatic, Baker, had an interesting story of his own, with his real life bond with his hero & the subsequent rejection he endured.Simmons & Stanley raiding an innocent Kiss convention like the NYPD illustrates just how much these members truly cherish their beloved army of followers.All in all, a great viewing of the troubled relationships between fans & their heroes, and the connection that binds them together.The extras are loaded on the DVD, as well, with some rare 1976 footage of Kiss tearing it up in their heyday.Recommended!",5,Great documentary!,1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,1026,"['Purchasing', 'DVD', 'subject', 'matter', 'seemed', 'intriguing', 'i', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'overall.However', 'viewing', 'i', 'came', 'away', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'film', '8th', 'grade', 'films.The', 'footage', 'Todd', 'Youth', 'Hell', 'kitchen', 'literally', 'Dick', 'Manitoba', 'were', 'worth', 'price', 'alone', 'yet', 'well', 'paced', 'thought', 'out', 'documentary', 'provided', 'so', 'much', 'more.The', 'rivalry', 'two', 'top', 'KISS', 'tribute', 'bands', 'was', 'fascinating', 'mirrored', 'fractured', 'relationships', 'actual', 'KISS.Ace', 'Frehley', 'fanatic', 'Baker', 'had', 'interesting', 'story', 'own', 'real', 'life', 'bond', 'hero', 'subsequent', 'rejection', 'Stanley', 'raiding', 'innocent', 'Kiss', 'convention', 'NYPD', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'members', 'truly', 'cherish', 'beloved', 'army', 'followers.All', 'great', 'viewing', 'troubled', 'relationships', 'fans', 'heroes', 'connection', 'together.The', 'extras', 'are', 'loaded', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'rare', '1976', 'footage', 'Kiss', 'tearing', 'up', 'heyday.Recommended']",Kiss Loves You
1104660,A24MFKJNHJDVZF,B000VWQUE2,Mel Zorro,"[11, 11]","This documentary gets some emotion out of you, that's for sure.  I bought it expecting to laugh at crazy KISS fans, but really it created the opposite reaction.Maybe I'm too close to the source material, being a semi-fanatical KISS Army member myself, as I found this to be a real downer.  But a very well done and interesting downer, with a few funny moments.Here were the high/low points:-The ""KISS Family"" was pretty wacky, it seemed like the Dad was the ring leader and the rest of the family was being dragged along for the ride (or brainwashed, in the case of the Paul Stanley obsessed son).  Even non-family gets roped in when ""Felix"" as Vinnie Vincent joins up.-The ""War of the Tribute Bands"" is interesting and has a nice wrap-up, although the drummer/roadie for Hotter Than Hell looks so road weary at the end, you just feel sorry for the guy.-Bill Baker's story really shows the dangers of idolizing your heroes.  He got to live the dream of being ""friends"" with Ace-but ended up being ""dumped"".  Really though, Bill appears to just have an obsessive personality, as he quickly moves on to idolizing Elvis-a hero that can't hurt or let him down.Other highlights include:-""Nerdy Gene"" at the convention who seems to take no pleasure in being a KISS fan, apparently it's serious business.-Hearing that the ""Paul Stanley Kid"" is now 13 and listens to Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys.-The silent 8mm footage of a Hotter Than Hell/Dressed to Kill show.I recommend this DVD to even the casual KISS fan, as it really places the role of KISS in perspective.  KISS rocks, KISS is fun, but maybe not the best thing to build your life around.Buy it and shed a tear or two...or not.",5,"Not like ""Trekkies"" with KISS",1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,1688,"['documentary', 'emotion', 'sure', 'bought', 'expecting', 'laugh', 'crazy', 'KISS', 'fans', 'really', 'created', 'opposite', 'reaction.Maybe', ""'m"", 'too', 'close', 'source', 'material', 'being', 'semi-fanatical', 'KISS', 'Army', 'member', 'found', 'be', 'real', 'downer', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'interesting', 'downer', 'few', 'funny', 'were', 'high/low', 'points', '-The', 'KISS', 'Family', 'was', 'pretty', 'wacky', 'seemed', 'Dad', 'was', 'ring', 'leader', 'rest', 'family', 'was', 'being', 'dragged', 'ride', 'brainwashed', 'case', 'Paul', 'Stanley', 'obsessed', 'son', 'Even', 'non-family', 'roped', 'when', 'Felix', 'Vinnie', 'Vincent', 'up.-The', 'War', 'Tribute', 'Bands', 'interesting', 'nice', 'wrap-up', 'drummer/roadie', 'Hotter', 'Than', 'Hell', 'so', 'road', 'weary', 'end', 'just', 'feel', 'sorry', 'guy.-Bill', 'Baker', 'story', 'really', 'dangers', 'idolizing', 'heroes', 'got', 'live', 'dream', 'being', 'friends', 'Ace-but', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'dumped', 'Really', 'Bill', 'just', 'have', 'obsessive', 'personality', 'quickly', 'idolizing', 'Elvis-a', 'hero', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'let', 'down.Other', 'highlights', 'include', 'Nerdy', 'Gene', 'convention', 'who', 'take', 'pleasure', 'being', 'KISS', 'fan', 'apparently', 'serious', 'business.-Hearing', 'Paul', 'Stanley', 'Kid', 'now', '13', 'listens', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Backstreet', 'Boys.-The', 'silent', '8mm', 'footage', 'Hotter', 'Than', 'Hell/Dressed', 'Kill', 'show.I', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'even', 'casual', 'KISS', 'fan', 'really', 'role', 'KISS', 'perspective', 'KISS', 'rocks', 'KISS', 'fun', 'maybe', 'not', 'best', 'thing', 'build', 'life', 'shed', 'tear', 'two', 'not']",Kiss Loves You

On one hand the footage of fans and tribute bands is really interesting but the film maker show kiss in a negative light in many scenes and while I know Gene & Paul are not perfect I dont think its fair that they didnt get to say their side of the story.
