He intercepts her on a train on her way to see her lover and, although she resists his attempt at first, later she succumbs.There are flashbacks by the man and woman to happier times, and some of these are pretty good. The best scene is when he first gets on the train: it's only after about ten minutes with the woman that we realize she is his wife - the surprise is wonderful. Lots of the expected Bergman pessimisms about love are here - ""The marriage bed is a death bed of love,"" boredom is the end-all of everything - which are handled well, certainly better than the staged jealous scene near the end and the ""all's well"" ending with cupid! On the whole, the picture is lighter in tone than most of Bergman's fare.

After 15 years of marriage, Marianne and David Erneman hardly lives together anymore but one day David decides to leave his mistress and to reconquer Marianne. Three major feminine figures gravitate round David -Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand- Erneman : his wife played by the sublime Eva Dahlbeck, his daughter played by the juvenile Harriet Andersson and at last his mistress impersonated by the venenous Yvonne Lombard. If this comedy of manners is interesting, it can't be compared with works of the same period likeSawdust and Tinsel - Criterion CollectionorSummer Interlude (Sommarlek) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.0 Import - Great Britain].

Gordon,"[0, 0]","While it may be heresy, I think I like this better than Bergman's much better known and lovedfollow up comedy ""Smiles of a Summer Night"".""A Lesson in Love"" has a wonderful mix of dry sophisticated wit, and much wilder almostscrewball comedy dancing together more smoothly than I would have thought possible, --all the while dealing surprisingly explicitly with such usually unfunny subjects as infidelityand the loss of passion in marriage.Indeed, if you made a comedy, not a tragedy out of `Scenes from a Marriage"" it might havebeen a little like this.Only in the third act does the film run out of steam a bit, starting to feel a bit forced in itsstory twists.  But I can't remember ever smiling, or laughing, so much at a Bergman film before.The Tartan DVD transfer is solid, if a little milky in the blacks.
