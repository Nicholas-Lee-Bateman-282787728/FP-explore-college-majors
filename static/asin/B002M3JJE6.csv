This is the most ""real"" family on TV showing the horseplay and general tomfoolery that are an integral part of having a family business. The crew of four includes ""The Old Man"" who started the business and acts as the voice of experience and keeps his son and grandson in check, ""Big Hoss"", the grandson son who is learning the business, and ""Chumlee"", the lifelong friend of Big Hoss who provides some very funny comic relief.They work together as a team with some frat boy antics that all guys will relate to, but always keep the business in the forefront. This is the background of the Los Vegas Pawn Shop, which is the setting for all manner of strange objects that are brought into the shop, usually to be sold. Each item is examined by the team for value and authenticity, and we learn some arcane history in the process. When there are questions of authenticity, one of the shop's outside experts will come in and examine the piece and provide some interesting information and make a decision as to whether it is what is seems to be.This is Antiques Roadshow without the mannered antiques experts, and serious tone.

Randall,"[0, 0]","With the glut of 'reality' shows out there (including all the trash that gets foisted on us by E!, TLC, and MTV), it's refreshing to find networks like the History Channel providing more genuine, legitimately entertaining, reality fare like ""Pawn Stars"".  ""Pawn Stars"" chronicles three generations of the Harrison family (and family friend Chumlee) as they operating their Las Vegas pawn shop, Gold & Silver Pawn.  The basic premise is the stories and dealings behind fascinating items that people come into the shop to sell.  The items can be intriguing based on their inherent value, like championship sports rings; their history value, such as a 1960's Les Paul guitar; or eclectic curiosity like taxidermy animals.  The story being told about the items is just as important, if not more important, than what it actually sells for.Now, while this could make for a solid show on those merits alone, what really sets ""Pawn Stars"" apart is the personality of its stars.  Rick Harrison opened the pawn shop in the late 80's with his father (referred to as ""The Old Man"") and brought his son Corey (and his friend, Chumlee) in to the business when they were old enough.  The Old Man is a funny curmudgeon; Rick is the often annoyed director of this circus; Corey is the frustrated son trying to prove himself; and Chumlee is the 'village idiot', who is dumb like a fox in how he has managed to parlay his popularity into a major side business.  They have some of the edginess of the Teutul family from ""American Chopper"" without any of the overt hostility and meanness of the Teutuls.Another success component of the show is its arsenal of subject experts who help evaluate the authenticity and value of the items the Harrisons are trying to purchase.  Some of the more notable ones include Mark Hall-Patton, the administrator of the Clark County Heritage Museum, who helps authenticate historical items; the adorable Rebecca Romney, of Bauman Rare Books, who is called in whenever their is an intriguing piece of literature in the shop; and Johnny Jiminez, who assesses vintage toys.  Two of the experts, Rick Dale of Rick's Restoration and Danny Coker of Counts Kustoms, have turned their participation into successful spin-off reality series of their own.There have been criticisms about the staged nature of the some of the deals, but that is just nit-picking and totally beside the point.  It's the interaction of the people and the stories they have that is the point.

Recently, the whole fam was seated in the living room watching this show and my daughter said, ""You know who Rick looks like?"" And I paused and couldn't come up with anything. Finally she said, ""He's Homer Simpson come to life. Look at him - he looks just like Homer!""I love Rick even more now. :)The show is such an interesting sociological study for so many different reasons. There's an awesome and interesting family dynamic between hardworking Rick and ""The Old Man"" and the always-had-everything-handed-to-him third generation son ""Corey."" I've read that many successful family businesses die off at the third generation. Seems the first generation (Hard-working Dad) and the second generation (Hard-working son Rick) remember those lean years and tough times and appreciate the value of a dollar and the joy and satisfaction of success. And then when the third generation comes along, all they've ever known is abundance and having everything they ever wanted dropped in their avoirdupois lap.Enter stage left Corey.It's fun to watch the show, but I cringe when he comes on screen. It pains me to hear how he talks to ""The Old Man."" Maybe he's a swell, upstanding, hardworking kid and the bratty kid spiel is part of the ""show."" I hope so. Gosh, I hope so.Aside from that, it's a fascinating insight into the hidden treasures stashed inside American attics and garages. It also proves that you should be careful about tossing out ""old junk."" Several times, visitors to the shop explain that they found their treasure in a trash pile somewhere.Excellent show, and presents a piece of American history in a most intriguing way!
