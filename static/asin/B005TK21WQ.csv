1503455,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005TK21WQ,A kids review,"[7, 13]","Director Sam Peckinpah was a noted Hollywood maverick for his tendency to court controversy with films punctuated by explicit violence, and his 1971 film Straw Dogs is arguably the most famous of the bunch. Earlier this year, Rod Lurie wrote, produced, and directed a remake of Straw Dogs with James Marsden and Kate Bosworth in the lead roles of the victimized couple, and I was none too impressed by his efforts. Marsden and Bosworth are David and Amy Sumner, a young married couple who decide to return to Amy's Southern hometown after her father's death to help prepare the family home for sale. In doing so, they enlist the help of Amy's ex-boyfriend in fixing up the home, and lingering tensions build until David and Amy find themselves in a deadly confrontation with the locals. For what it's worth, I did feel that the remake succeeded in streamlining the original script a bit, but without the deft hand of Peckinpah at the helm, the film makes the mistake of celebrating its violence, rather than examining it. As such, I give Straw Dogs 1 star, and only those with a hankering for a bit of the old ultraviolence will find this a pleasing affair.",1,Straw Dogs,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,1157,"['Director', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'was', 'noted', 'Hollywood', 'maverick', 'tendency', 'court', 'controversy', 'films', 'punctuated', 'explicit', 'violence', '1971', 'film', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'arguably', 'most', 'famous', 'bunch', 'Earlier', 'year', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'wrote', 'produced', 'directed', 'remake', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'lead', 'roles', 'victimized', 'couple', 'was', 'none', 'too', 'impressed', 'efforts', 'Marsden', 'Bosworth', 'are', 'David', 'Amy', 'Sumner', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'decide', 'return', 'Amy', 'Southern', 'hometown', 'father', 'death', 'help', 'prepare', 'family', 'home', 'sale', 'doing', 'so', 'enlist', 'help', 'Amy', 'ex-boyfriend', 'fixing', 'up', 'home', 'lingering', 'tensions', 'build', 'David', 'Amy', 'find', 'deadly', 'confrontation', 'locals', 'what', 'worth', 'did', 'feel', 'remake', 'succeeded', 'streamlining', 'original', 'script', 'bit', 'deft', 'hand', 'Peckinpah', 'helm', 'film', 'mistake', 'celebrating', 'violence', 'rather', 'examining', 'such', 'give', 'Straw', 'Dogs', '1', 'star', 'only', 'hankering', 'bit', 'old', 'ultraviolence', 'will', 'find', 'pleasing', 'affair']",Straw Dogs

1503459,A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,B005TK21WQ,"Bill Your 'Free Form FM Print DJ ""bill nicholas""","[2, 2]","This is a remake of Sam Peckenpahs 1971's Straw Dogs, a classic film about a pacifist mathematician, David Summner, who flees riot and protest ridden America to live in rural England. He seeks to repair his strained marriage, by moving back to Amy's, his wife, home town. Instead, he is bullied by local villagers who eventually rape his wife and storm his house. He kills all of them using hot acid, a fireplace poker, and a bear trap.Ron Lurie's remake of the film keeps the plot elements, but makes several character and thematic changes. Here, the wife is from the deep south, and David is a screenwriter. Obviously the campus turmoil of the 1971 version was not a reason for David's moving to the south in 2011, so the implication of him ""hiding"" is not here.But how the rape is handled is to me the key shift. In the 1971 version, Amy had more of a history, and sexual energy. with Charlie, one of the men who rapes her. Sexist as it today sounds, the first rape-which Amy eventually submits to, kissing and caressing Charlie-- was filmed show Amy had mixed feelings about Charlie, and her loyalty to David. David slaps Amy in the first film when she is about to dart to the other side, and this makes her role, and David's actions, that much more ambiguous and disturbing.I understand Lurie's impulse to resist making rape erotic and emotionally ambivalent--this is what made Peckenpah's film so controversial in its era- but real world right and wrong does not make for compelling film. Lurie has sacrificed artistically rewarding gray areas for politically safe black and white. Amy's rape here is strictly a violation, and pits the men against Amy and David. Good verses evil. When the final confrontation comes, Amy's loyalties are clearly to David. She is not used as a pawn in the battle as the character was in 1971. Instead is delivered the mentally lazy, heroes and villains action fare that is such lower a target then Straw Dogs aims for.It's production values lift it above a simple revenge flick, but Straw Dogs 2011 gives you dime-a-dozen cinematic vindication, where 1971's version leaves you with nothing but disturbing questions. The two films are as different as the times. You don't come away from this thinking about what it means and what the cost is when violence is needed--after 9/11? Iraq? There is no bigger context here, and that makes this an entertaining under-reach: frustrating when a film about the role of violence, made in the ""age of terror"" could have been as thought provoking about our times as Peckenpah's was about Vietnam and Watts and Kent State.

Tensions flare between David and several of the locals after a few unfortunate altercations, but how far will David go to defend himself when he is pushed over the edge? STRAW DOGS can be counted amongst several of the most unnecessary remakes in the 2000's. Rather than spend his time returning to the original novel in an attempt to present something new entirely, writer/director Rod Lurie has tried (and failed) to recreate Sam Peckinpah's controversial screen adaptation with minimal changes to the plot or characters. The cast, which includes James Marsden and Kate Bosworth in leading roles, is far less effective, and in trying to imitate the timely delivery of the first film, Lurie has forgotten that modern audiences only have a limited attention span. He also feels the need to repeatedly spell out the underlying themes in the film, presuming that the audience is too unintelligent to understand them. This leaves only the controversial rape scene and ultra-violent ending for fans to look forward to, which also serve to disappoint given the level of desensitization that now exists.

Its even rarer to find a remake that out shines it's source material.  This new retelling of Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs is one of those rare finds.  Though a lot has change in the forty years since Dustin Hoffman first picked up a gun and grew into a man, the story is as timeless as the Bible and the end result, though very bloody, is far less pessimistic than the 1970s' version.The story remains faithful with a few changes here and there.  David Sumner (James Marsden; X-Men, Bachelorette) and his new wife Amy (Kate Bosworth; Blue Crush, Superman Returns) have come back to Amy's hometown to fix up her late father's home.  Almost immediately, the town isn't exactly rolling out the red carpet for her Hollywood writer husband.  In fact, they're downright rude (In one scene, David pulls out his credit card to pay for dinner and the waitress says ""Cash only; its what us common folk use."". Sorry, b*tch but I'm as common as they come and I rarely, if ever carry cash.).  But in strolls Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard; ""True Blood"", Battleship), Amy's ex boyfriend and the town's one time football legend.  He seems friendly enough but his calm and cool demeanor masks an ugly side that few people outside his band of redneck friends know about.I'm a big fan of Peckinpah's original vision (I own the now OOP Criterion release bought from Amazon as well) but the man's pessimistic attitude to our kind as well as his mean streak towards women bleeds through and the movie suffered because of it.  And the biggest and best change in the update is with the Amy character.  While Susan George is a beautiful woman, she made Amy out to be like the Paris Hilton of her day.  She was also a completely unsympathetic character so when Charlie and his friend rapes her, you pretty much felt she got what was coming.  Kate, on the other hand, gives Amy a warmth and compassionate side so that when the rape occurs (though less graphic), the abuse she suffers makes it all more realistic that we're almost prompted to shut the movie off.  Plus, she is very much in love with her husband despite his flaws and it shows where, in the original, I was scratching my head trying to figure out how this nerdy mathematician was lucky enough to land such a bombshell of a wife.I think the theaters are over flooded with remakes today so it's not surprising to know that this remake bombed out during its theatrical run.  But if you're willing to give it a shot, you will not be disappointed.  Just be warned that though the film isn't as bleak as its predecessor, its still very violent and not for the faint of heart.

This is her hometown, but its all too foreign to David. The secluded property and beautiful background seem an ideal place for him to finish work on his Stalingrad project. It doesn't take long for this thought to diminish from his mind.As much as David tries to mix with the locals and feel a part of the community, theres always something that doesn't work. Theres several times in the film where he goes out of his way to be courteous, but the locals don't seem to like an outsider in their town. A rich, clean cut outsider to be precise. This film builds an ominous tone very well through the course of the story. While the film feeds off the differences between David and the locals, it also shows David changing in his own way later in the film. Amy's(Bosworth) ex-boyfriend Charlie (Skarsgard)enters the picture early and often in the young couple's life. Skarsgard really does a nice job with his character. You never have a good feeling about Charlie from the first frame, when he starts in on Amy, as David gets a beer at the bar. The situation worsens when he is hired to repair the roof to David and Amy's home. That puts Charlie and his hunting/roofing buddies too close to the couples everyday life. James Woods is very good as well in portraying ""coach"" a beer drinking, raucous legend in the small town. It seems everyone in the town played for coach in the past and he has the respect of most. The coach has his own issues with his daughter and a mentally challenged man. This adds another level of brooding to the story. Another factor is the difference in ideals and beliefs between David and Amy. The couple clearly love each other, but its not a rock solid foundation. The movie continues with a good pace, without any moments of dullness. These storylines set up a brutal, climatic ending.There are several uncomfortable scenes and shocking ones as well. This is not for everyone. That includes a rape scene. The film overall is well done. I think Marsden/Bosworth/Woods/Skarsgard are excellent in the film. There are some well filmed scenes in this one. Including a few with a deer. Although many will compare this to the 1971 classic, this movie has a different setting and an updated story. I like both movies. For me, they're both good in their own way.

Perl ""Dragon""","[2, 3]","Rod Lurie does change the location and time period of ""Straw Dogs,"" but the psychological aspects of the original film are almost completely lost.  Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"" really went deep into the mentalities of the characters. David was a totally non-violent mild mannered mathematician.  Dustin Hoffman plays David as a likable guy who just wants to get his grant work done, and he is very intelligent.  The idea here is what it takes to make a pacifist turn to violence.  What is that turning point?  Hoffman's David is a layered character with real dimension and depth.  James Marsden as a somewhat egotistical Hollywood writer is really not a very likeable character.  Thus the overall impact of the new film is reduced.Amy wanted David to be more of a man and had a stronger connection to her town, and its people, in the Peckinpah film.  She did not like, or try to protect, Henry Niles.  Her mental torment, after the crime committed against her, is fully realized in the original film.  Peckinpah envisioned her character as a confused immature individual who was unsure of what choices she should make.  She had been arguing with David for sometime before she finally started flashing her panties while stepping out of her car and removing her clothing at the window to flash the townie carpenters.  In Lurie's version, there seems to be no reason for Amy to doff her top.  Thus, she becomes very two dimensional.  There is very little depth to Kate Bosworth's characterization of Amy.James Woods does his ""redneck thing"" effectively, but does not really seem like someone who would have the respect of his peers to make them dance to his brutal tune.  The same character in the Peckinpah film was the Cornish town's patriarch, and the viewer could understand why the younger members of the town would follow and obey him.Anyone who has seen Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"" would understand why the remake does not stand up the original.  The intensity of the story is greatly reduced. The irony of the story is surgically removed. One shock scene was totally removed from the remake.

1503475,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B005TK21WQ,Erik North,"[2, 4]","It would appear that in the 21st century, everything old is new again.  And perhaps nowhere is that more true than in Hollywood.  Whether it is in remakes or sequels, Hollywood has this way of repeating itself.  As a result, it seems most unsettling that one of the films from the past that should be remade for a 21st century audience would be a film that, when released near the end of 1971, caused extreme uproar because of its explicit violence and sexual material.  The film in question is director Sam Peckinpah's controversial shocker STRAW DOGS, which remains, alongside Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, among the most hotly debated films of its time or any time in history.  For whatever reason, though, Hollywood thought it needed an updating, and so former film critic turned director/screenwriter Rod Lurie stepped into the shoes of ""Bloody Sam"" to do it.Following both the film's original source material (Gordon M. Williams' 1969 novel ""The Siege Of Trencher's Farm"") and the 1971 screenplay written by David Zelag Goodman and Peckinpah, this particular version was moved from the original's setting on the Cornwall coast of England to a backwater town somewhere along the Mississippi/Louisiana border.  James Marsden takes on the role of David Sumner (played by Dustin Hoffman in 1971), who has come to this small Southern town with his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth, taking over for Susan George) to work on a movie screenplay based on the 1943 battle of Stalingrad.  And as it so happens, his seeming demure nature puts the redneck boys down there in the position of superiority over him, first when Bosworth's pet cat is found strangled in the closet, then, to make matters even more sinister, when Bosworth is raped by her former boyfriend (Alexander Skarsgard) and another man (Rhys Coiro).Marsden, however, comes to his senses when he takes in the local mental invalid (Dominic Purcell) who has unintentionally strangled the daughter (Willa Holland) of the town's ex-football coach (James Woods).  Woods, Coiro, and Skarsgard show up on Marsden's property and brutally demand that Purcell be handed over to them, but Marsden, knowing fully well what will happen to him, Purcell, and Bosworth, does no such thing.  The end result is ultra-violent mayhem in the film's last twenty minutes.Lurie, who made two of the best films of the year 2000 (DETERRENCE; THE CONTENDER) likely set himself up for a fall in trying to tone down the most objectionable parts of the Peckinpah original that made it, in the eyes of some, a ""fascist"" work of art: the rape scene, which is a bit too quickly done and a bit too aimed to show Bosworth as a feminist, though she is every bit as traumatized as George was in the original; and unwisely discounting the idea posited by Peckinpah, and based on the works of noted anthropologist Robert Ardrey, that Man's penchant for brutality and violence, far from the common notion that they would go to any means to protect their ""property"", is ingrained in him from the start.  The other thing that is objectionable about this new version of STRAW DOGS is that, unlike the English village where Peckinpah sees the seemingly primitive villagers as every bit the match for Hoffman, the ones in this small Southern town are the unfortunate stereotypical inbred rednecks, especially Woods, who, normally a solid actor, is allowed by Lurie to overact outrageously.  And the siege, though fairly well staged, is nevertheless so hyper-violent that the audience becomes a tad bit detached, instead of really being forced to confront their inner demons, as Hoffman's character, and to a great extent Peckinpah himself, did in the original film.  Whereas Peckinpah was deliberately ambiguous and thought provoking, and not just a blood-and-guts expert, Lurie makes the mistake of trying to wrap everything up in a neat, albeit very bloody package.Nevertheless, despite these flaws that keep Lurie's film from reaching the nightmarish heights of Peckinpah's, the 2011 STRAW DOGS features solid enough performances from Marsden and Bosworth, who are able to capture the psychological torment that their characters feel.  They are still in the shadow of what Hoffman and George did in 1971, but they are able to bring a certain kind of resolve and emotional gravitas to the situation that Lurie doesn't always provide in his direction or script.  Larry Groupe's score, though distractingly loud at times (this in contrast to the subtlety of the original film's excellent Jerry Fielding score), also works in those moments where it's supposed to.  The end result is, like many remakes, rather imperfect.  Still, there have been far worse remakes that Hollywood has done, and will yet do.",4,Imperfect Remake Of Peckinpah's Nightmarish Classic--But I've Seen Far Worse,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,4717,"['would', 'appear', '21st', 'century', 'everything', 'old', 'new', 'again', 'perhaps', 'nowhere', 'more', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'remakes', 'sequels', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'repeating', 'result', 'most', 'unsettling', 'one', 'films', 'past', 'should', 'be', 'remade', '21st', 'century', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'when', 'released', 'end', '1971', 'caused', 'extreme', 'uproar', 'explicit', 'violence', 'sexual', 'material', 'film', 'question', 'director', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'controversial', 'shocker', 'STRAW', 'DOGS', 'alongside', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'most', 'hotly', 'debated', 'films', 'time', 'time', 'history', 'reason', 'though', 'Hollywood', 'thought', 'needed', 'updating', 'so', 'former', 'film', 'critic', 'turned', 'director/screenwriter', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'stepped', 'shoes', 'Bloody', 'Sam', 'do', 'it.Following', 'both', 'film', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'Gordon', 'M.', 'Williams', '1969', 'Siege', 'Trencher', 'Farm', '1971', 'screenplay', 'written', 'David', 'Zelag', 'Goodman', 'Peckinpah', 'particular', 'version', 'was', 'moved', 'original', 'setting', 'Cornwall', 'coast', 'England', 'backwater', 'town', 'somewhere', 'Mississippi/Louisiana', 'border', 'James', 'Marsden', 'role', 'David', 'Sumner', 'played', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', '1971', 'who', 'come', 'small', 'Southern', 'town', 'wife', 'Amy', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'taking', 'over', 'Susan', 'George', 'work', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'based', '1943', 'battle', 'Stalingrad', 'so', 'seeming', 'demure', 'nature', 'redneck', 'down', 'there', 'position', 'superiority', 'first', 'when', 'Bosworth', 'pet', 'cat', 'found', 'strangled', 'closet', 'then', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'more', 'sinister', 'when', 'Bosworth', 'raped', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgard', 'man', 'Rhys', 'Coiro', '.Marsden', 'however', 'senses', 'when', 'local', 'mental', 'invalid', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'who', 'unintentionally', 'strangled', 'daughter', 'Willa', 'Holland', 'town', 'ex-football', 'coach', 'James', 'Woods', 'Woods', 'Coiro', 'Skarsgard', 'show', 'up', 'Marsden', 'property', 'brutally', 'demand', 'Purcell', 'be', 'handed', 'over', 'Marsden', 'knowing', 'fully', 'well', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Purcell', 'Bosworth', 'such', 'thing', 'end', 'result', 'ultra-violent', 'mayhem', 'film', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes.Lurie', 'who', 'made', 'two', 'best', 'films', 'year', '2000', 'DETERRENCE', 'THE', 'CONTENDER', 'likely', 'set', 'fall', 'trying', 'tone', 'down', 'most', 'objectionable', 'parts', 'Peckinpah', 'original', 'made', 'eyes', 'fascist', 'work', 'art', 'rape', 'scene', 'bit', 'too', 'quickly', 'done', 'bit', 'too', 'aimed', 'show', 'Bosworth', 'feminist', 'bit', 'as', 'traumatized', 'George', 'was', 'original', 'unwisely', 'discounting', 'idea', 'posited', 'Peckinpah', 'based', 'works', 'noted', 'anthropologist', 'Robert', 'Ardrey', 'Man', 'penchant', 'brutality', 'violence', 'far', 'common', 'notion', 'would', 'go', 'means', 'protect', 'property', 'ingrained', 'start', 'other', 'thing', 'objectionable', 'new', 'version', 'STRAW', 'DOGS', 'English', 'village', 'where', 'Peckinpah', 'seemingly', 'primitive', 'villagers', 'bit', 'match', 'Hoffman', 'ones', 'small', 'Southern', 'town', 'are', 'unfortunate', 'stereotypical', 'inbred', 'rednecks', 'especially', 'Woods', 'who', 'normally', 'solid', 'actor', 'allowed', 'Lurie', 'overact', 'outrageously', 'siege', 'fairly', 'well', 'staged', 'nevertheless', 'so', 'hyper-violent', 'audience', 'tad', 'bit', 'detached', 'instead', 'really', 'being', 'forced', 'confront', 'inner', 'demons', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'great', 'extent', 'Peckinpah', 'did', 'original', 'film', 'Whereas', 'Peckinpah', 'was', 'deliberately', 'ambiguous', 'thought', 'provoking', 'not', 'just', 'blood-and-guts', 'expert', 'Lurie', 'mistake', 'trying', 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', 'neat', 'albeit', 'very', 'bloody', 'package.Nevertheless', 'flaws', 'keep', 'Lurie', 'film', 'reaching', 'nightmarish', 'heights', 'Peckinpah', '2011', 'STRAW', 'DOGS', 'solid', 'enough', 'performances', 'Marsden', 'Bosworth', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'capture', 'psychological', 'torment', 'characters', 'feel', 'are', 'still', 'shadow', 'what', 'Hoffman', 'George', 'did', '1971', 'are', 'able', 'bring', 'certain', 'kind', 'resolve', 'emotional', 'gravitas', 'situation', 'Lurie', ""n't"", 'always', 'provide', 'direction', 'script', 'Larry', 'Groupe', 'score', 'distractingly', 'loud', 'times', 'contrast', 'subtlety', 'original', 'film', 'excellent', 'Jerry', 'Fielding', 'score', 'also', 'moments', 'where', 'supposed', 'end', 'result', 'many', 'remakes', 'rather', 'imperfect', 'Still', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'worse', 'remakes', 'Hollywood', 'done', 'will', 'yet', 'do']",Straw Dogs

If you've read other reviews you also know that this contains a rape scene which is a little odd and also pretty graphic but doesn't last too long (at least not enough to want to stop watching). The main part of this movie I didn't care for was the husband and his attitude towards his wife. I felt like he thought she was to do as he told her to - particularly the scene at the picnic when they get back in the care (I figured this had something to do with the year the original movie was made in though). If the movie had been a bit more fast paced with a husband who actually seemed to care, this would have received five stars - the ending definitely makes it worthy.My favorite part of this movie was how the movie unraveled until the very end, which starts at the second football game. I really enjoyed seeing the movie end without any use of guns by our hero who used his wits to outsmart ""the bad guys"" who had guns.

1503480,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005TK21WQ,Grady Harp,"[4, 6]","STRAW DOGS  is a terrifying tale of man's inhumanity to man, terrifying in that it recreates some situations that remain active in certain parts of this country - of this world - and because it is difficult to stand as an observer to such unmitigated abuse.  There are those who decry this updated version of the story and insist on comparing it to the 1971 Sam Peckinpah original, but putting aside the original film this piece of cinema is a finely constructed work that hopefully will leave the viewer disturbed, so grisly is its message. Director Rod Lurie adapted the screenplay from the original written by Sam Peckinpah and David Zelag Goodman who molded the screen version of Gordon Williams novel 'The Siege of Trencher's Farm'.  The story has been updated and certain aspects of the characters have been changed, but this new version of Williams' novel is searingly real and brutally frightening.The title is significant and deserves definition: `Straw dogs were used as ceremonial objects in ancient China. Chapter 5 of the Tao Te Ching begins with the lines ""Heaven and Earth are heartless / treating creatures like straw dogs"". Su Ch'e comments ""Heaven and Earth are not partial. They do not kill living things out of cruelty or give them birth out of kindness. We do the same when we make straw dogs to use in sacrifices. We dress them up and put them on the altar, but not because we love them. And when the ceremony is over, we throw them into the street, but not because we hate them.'Screenwriter David Sumner (James Marsden) and his now-actress wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) are moving from Hollywood to Blackwater, Mississippi - Amy's hometown - to live in Amy's old homestead.  Once there they meet the charming and handsomely macho Charlie (Alexander Skarsgrd) who apparently had dated Amy before she left her home for an acting career in Hollywood.  Charlie has an evil aura but offers to help David and Amy repair their new home that has been tattered by the recent hurricane.  Charlie brings his crew - Norman (Rhys Coiro), Chris (Billy Lush) and Bic (Drew Powell) - to begin work on the Sumner home, but they are a motley crew, barging into the house for beer, and leaving early each day for hunting deer. David, who simply wants a peaceful place to write his script about the 1944 Stalingrad battle is concerned about their brazen behavior but Amy reassures him that is the Southern way: it is obvious that the crew is eyeing the scantily dressed Amy.Visits in town include time in the bar where David encounters the crazy, lethally behaving Coach Tom Heddon (James Woods) interacting with not only his crew but also with abusive behavior to the mentally challenged Jeremy Niles (Domenic Purcell) who is protected by his brother Daniel (Walton Goggins) in the Coach's accusations that Jeremy is too close to the Coach's 15 year old daughter Janice (Willa Holland).  David takes it all in and realizes that all is not as it seems.David and Amy try to fit in to the town - attending parties and football games - but when Charlie and crew invite David to go hunting with them and David reluctantly accepts, the gruesome part of the film begins: David kills a deer against his better judgment only to discover that Charlie and crew have deserted him in the woods and are back at David's home attacking Amy.  The action then becomes  one of protracted violence as the crew and Coach attack the Sumner home (David and Amy are protecting Jeremy from the wrath of the Coach) and the normally peace living David must become a warrior against evil.Though the story is repugnantly similar to some life situations (and this viewer had difficulty simply watching portions of the film), the acting by everyone in the film is unusually fine.  James Marsden, Kate Bosworth, and the brilliant rising star Alexander Skarsgrd make their characters totally credible and Rod Lurie's direction is keenly sensitive to every innuendo in the film.  This is one of the strongest works on the screen and deserves a much larger audience.

This is not a remake but a reinterpretation, an update if you will, to fit 21st century America.What changes: How women are treated and how they react to that treatment from the earlier version of submission to the contemporary version of independence. What doesn't change:  Idolatry persists whether it's on the field or in the pews; hatred persists whether it's race, or mental/physical disabilities. The symbolism of hunting, whether it's deer or women, to prove manhood and superiority is iconic.An implied, and controversial, characterization of regional institutionalized intolerance as a function of mistrust of educational attainment and religious zealotry is present in both versions. What are straw dogs? They are the scapegoats, the easily discarded, the outsiders on which to place blame and thus, perhaps, release inner guilt. Guilt creates tension and the characters, both the locals and the newly arrived couple, hide but cannot escape those tensions.Kudos to the director, cast and crew for building that tension for the audience.

Yes, Lurie provides a suitable stand-in with these small town proto-white trash caricatures, but Marsden never feels like ""the other.""  In the original, his accent will always betray him.

What worked in the original was that Susan George wasn't that strong, a delicate flower that Hoffman's character felt he was protecting.  You could understand why her personality type found something in Hoffman's intellectual.  In the remake, Bosworth is very much her own woman and her attraction to Marsden is somewhat amorphous.  I don't know what she saw in him, really, which weakens what should be the character that the entire story turns on.One last thing.

1503487,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005TK21WQ,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[4, 5]","With Sam Peckinpah's original film of STRAW DOGS, part of the tale (as with most Peckinpah films) is very allegorical. His version, with Dustin Hoffman, is an ugly and brutal film that, thematically, basically says that the true birth of a man is through violence. Rod Lurie's remake of this film moves locale from Britain's countryside to the Deep South of the USA, but thematically works on a similar theme, but it REALLY hits you over the head with it. Lurie also directed the sadly overrated THE CONTENDER (with Joan Allen as the veep with the sex-tape past), so I wasn't looking forward to it for his work. I wasn't looking forward to it for the work of Kate Bosworth either, since she just doesn't have much in the way of charm or genuine appeal. I love Alexander Skarsgard on TRUE BLOOD, but I didn't see much playing to his strengths here. I saw this primarily because I believe that James Marsden (The X-MEN trilogy, HOP, ENCHANTED, GOSSIP, THE 24TH HOUR) is one of the more underrated and under-utilized actors in Hollywood.The tale here is simple; West Coast screenwriter and ""liberal elitist"" Marsden and his new bride Bosworth travel back to her home in Mississippi intend to stay at her ancestral home after her father's passing long enough to square away the estate and for Marsden to finish his screenplay about The Battle of Stalingrad. Skarsgard is her former high-school jock boyfriend who has a housing repair business, and naturally still carries a torch for her. Marsden heads into the town bar, who has the town drunk and former high school football coach James Woods inhabiting it. Marsden looks down his nose at his new neighbors and Woods makes fun of him for having no laces on his sneakers. Marsden also comes across brothers Walton Goggins (in a role that wastes his massive talent) and Dominic Purcell, who are the George and Lenny of the town. Purcell is apparently a special-needs adult who likes to expose himself to young girls, and Goggins tries his best to keep him out of trouble. Woods has a high-school age daughter that, for a TOTALLY INEXPLICABLE reason, keeps coming on to Purcell (I get that he's good-looking at all, but he's a convicted sex-offender), and of course, this angers Woods to no end. Skarsgard and his employees/cronies make crude comments about and do rude things to Marsden and Bosworth, but Skarsgard's steely gaze is so fixed on Bosworth and from a character standpoint, he's wondering to himself how a ""wimp"" like Marsden could have a woman like Bosworth. Through a series of increasingly bizarre and dramatically inorganic events, we eventually get a violent and blood-soaked stand-off between Skarsgard, Woods and Co. versus Marsden and Bosworth.Really, there are so many more problems than solutions in this mess of a film. Firstly, Lurie apparently felt that keeping the original film's rape scene was essential to the storytelling. Now, it's pretty evident through Peckinpah's body of work (e.g. THE WILD BUNCH, THE GETAWAY and the original version of this film) that he was not a feminist pioneer. Violence against women ran rampant in his films and was no less excusable then than it is now, but for whatever reason, the 1970's had a pervasive psychoanalytical belief that rape was a secret fantasy of every woman and somehow was easier to show on screen. In 2011, this belief has been completely and totally invalidated. Therefore, there is NO REASON WHATSOEVER that A: this scene was necessary to the plot or to character development other than to stay true to the original text and B: that a wife would believably keep this a secret from her husband. Second is that Marsden is so handsome and well-built that A: Skarsgard wouldn't believably be quite as insanely jealous since it's someone who's not terribly dissimilar other than, of course, his intelligence and B: when he's flailing around in the final confrontation between himself and Skarsgard (I'm not giving anything away here if you didn't think this was coming from the description of the film), it looks incredibly unrealistic and silly despite the fact that Lurie is desperate to go for realism here. Third, the catalyst of the stand-off is just such a ridiculous contrivance that I honestly find it hard to believe that someone wrote that into a major motion picture.Lurie tries to add more substance to this film than it deserves as Marsden recounts the events of the Battle of Stalingrad to another character and discusses how it was about a very small force that held a vastly superior force at bay and even if you didn't know the story of the film already, it's such a forced story that you know that sometime before the credits roll, the story of Marsden and Bosworth will somehow parallel the soldiers of Stalingrad. THAT'S the kind of film this is. Despite all of this, Marsden still manages to pull off a mostly-convincing and strong performance, but the film doesn't allow the rest of the cast to play to their strengths. Skarsgard has some very wicked blood in him as a performer, but he can also has an incredible sense of comic timing. All this performance requires of him, though, is to be a violent backwater cliche, as also with Woods, who deserves better than this film.It's not a complete waste of time because there are a few moments that are interesting enough from a character standpoint, and a few moments that are laugh-out-loud unintentionally funny (namely the nail gun and the bear trap) that do make this remake of STRAW DOGS kind of worth watching.",2,I'm still waiting for James Marsden to get the star role he deserves.,1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,5510,"['Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'original', 'film', 'STRAW',

The choice of setting the 2011 film in the Red State American South makes a whole lot more sense than putting it in rural Wales. Peckinpah probably chickened out on this most logical choice because he had too many cracker and cowboy drinking buddies. Too bad.

It's not a bad film.  It's just not one of the director's best.  I think he was more comfortable working with stories set in the American West than in rural England.For the most part, I don't like remakes.  But, since the original STRAW DOGS is no classic, I don't have a problem with it being remade.  On the other hand, was a remake really necessary?That said, I do believe that the basic story works better in this new 2011 version than in Peckinpah's picture.  Most of the changes are cosmetic, but they are improvements.Now set in backwoods Mississippi, the story centers on Daivd and Amy Sumner (James Marsden, Kate Bosworth), a Hollywood couple who move to Amy's family home to prepare the house for sale and so that David can have a quiet place to write his screenplay.  Once there, tensions build in their marriage and also with the locals, particularly Amy's old boy friend (Alexander Skarsgard), who resents David and wants to win her back.  Violence erupts, the Sumner home comes under siege and the quiet peace-loving David finds that he must now kill or be killed.Aside from the locale and the fact that the David Sumner character is now a screenwriter, rather than a mathematician, perhaps the most significant change in the this remake from writer/director Rod Lurie is that the wife, Amy, is much more sympathetic.  In the original, the character was very unlikable.James Woods, Dominic Purcell and Willa Holland co-star in this well-acted, suspenseful drama, now available on DVD from Sony Home Entertainment.DVD extras include audio commentary by Lurie, plus four ""Making of"" featurettes.""

Writer/director Rod Lurie takes his time setting up the story, moving slowly but ominously toward its violent conclusion.  Other reviewers felt torn on whom to sympathize with, a problem I didn't share.  Admittedly David's character is egotistical, judgmental and a little snooty and wife Amy a little vapid and flirtatious, but that doesn't reach the level of decadence from the locals who torment a mentally challenged young man, kill the wife's cat, assault and rape the wife and ultimately destroy the couple's home.James Marsden as the husband has a hard time channeling the nebbish writer and the aggressive hero, but his efforts are commendable.  Kate Bosworth fills her role well, going from the flighty ex-cheerleader to the frightened victim.  TRUE BLOOD's Alexander Skarsgard is effectively chilling as Amy's former lover whose striking good looks belie a dark interior.  Dominic Purcell is good as Jeremy, the mentally challenged man whose innocent act of violence propels the film's violent climax.  Oscar nominee James Woods chews up the scenery quite well as the drunken coach who incites the locals to lawless oblivion.STRAW DOGS is a grim movie that shows how far one man goes to protect his family and is an efficient thriller.",4,EFFECTIVE REMAKE,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,1351,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'STRAW', 'DOGS', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'can', 'only', 'offer', 'comments', 'remake', 'Writer/director', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'story', 'moving', 'slowly', 'ominously', 'violent', 'conclusion', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'felt', 'torn', 'whom', 'sympathize', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'share', 'Admittedly', 'David', 'character', 'egotistical', 'judgmental', 'little', 'snooty', 'wife', 'Amy', 'little', 'vapid', 'flirtatious', ""n't"", 'reach', 'level', 'decadence', 'locals', 'who', 'torment', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'young', 'man', 'kill', 'wife', 'cat', 'assault', 'rape', 'wife', 'ultimately', 'destroy', 'couple', 'home.James', 'Marsden', 'husband', 'hard', 'time', 'channeling', 'nebbish', 'writer', 'aggressive', 'hero', 'efforts', 'are', 'commendable', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'role', 'well', 'going', 'flighty', 'ex-cheerleader', 'frightened', 'victim', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgard', 'effectively', 'chilling', 'Amy', 'former', 'lover', 'striking', 'good', 'looks', 'belie', 'dark', 'interior', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'good', 'Jeremy', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'man', 'innocent', 'act', 'violence', 'propels', 'film', 'violent', 'climax', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'James', 'Woods', 'up', 'scenery', 'quite', 'well', 'drunken', 'coach', 'who', 'locals', 'lawless', 'oblivion.STRAW', 'DOGS', 'grim', 'movie', 'how', 'far', 'one', 'man', 'protect', 'family', 'efficient', 'thriller']",Straw Dogs

Having recently purchased and viewed the original Straw Dogs in blu-ray I found it to be very lacking in comparison; And, being a remake it invites the inevitable comparison. One thing lacking is the palpable tension throughout the original movie. This one has the same characters and many of the very same lines and is still without the certain foreboding, tension filled atmosphere. James Woods who is scary just to look at is not as scary as Peter Vaughan. The other characters casting is in doubt as well. Dustin Hoffman was certainly more book-wormish  and out of place than James Marston as David Sumner. Even Dominic Purcell as Jeremy Niles was a stretch that I couldn't see.***(Spoiler Alert)***The modernization and move to the United States didn't help any. How come when someone shoots a car they blow up immediately? The changes didn't help the movie at all.  The death of Hedden without the attack at the end was taken out and lessens the film. Dustin Hoffman was much more convincing and frantic in the hold off at the ranch. The hunting scene was very out of place. The entire change of that to deer hunting was not helpful. The rape scene was weirder as well, lacking the subtle desire versus submission. The connection of Jeremy Niles to Hedden's Daughter(Willa Holland) was not built up either and mis-cast in my opinion.So due to so many little things that I found lacking in comparison to the original I found it very difficult to like anything about this movie. It was like they just took all that was ""good"" about the original and left it out of it. I would give it 2 1/2 stars if I could.

Oleson,"[15, 19]","Director and writer Rod Lurie resurrects the old Sam Peckinpah film from 1971 by moving it from the pretty English countryside to the backwoods of Mississippi.  James Marsden takes on the role of David, a Hollywood screenwriter for mostly TV shows.  While he's no macho man, he's not quite the nebbish mathematician played by Dustin Hoffman.  Amy this time around is played by Kate Bosworth as opposed to Susan George.  Amy is a minor league TV actress who met David on the job.  They return to her Mississippi home where popular pastimes are high school football, drinking and killing stuff.The plot pretty much plays out like the original, so comparisons seem relevant.  Both David and Amy are much more likeable here.  Bosworth's Amy isn't quite the flirt the character was in the original.  Still, she doesn't hide her sexiness.  And while this might not be a problem in some worlds, she should know better than to flaunt it in Blackwater, especially when one of the voyeurs is a hulking 6'6"" former boyfriend (Alexander Skarsgard).  One of my observations of the controversial rape scene in the original was that Susan George seemed to still have feelings for the Charlie character and didn't fight him off with much vigor and in fact began kissing him back.  Not here, as Bosworth fights harder but eventually is overwhelmed.  The second rape by Norman is less focused  as the camera centers on Amy's suffering.  The climatic attack on the house is updated with more explosions, louder guns and the killings are a bit more explicit.I suspect the novel's author was providing a couple moral implications to chew on.  At what point does a man crack to protect his family and home?  Do ultimately violent acts diminish man's peaceful intents?  This version doesn't seem to care about the later.  This is pretty much a revenge movie.

I didn't love the 1971 version starring Dustin Hoffman, but for the time it was released it was very brutal and I got the point the director was trying to make. This telling of Straw Dogs is basically a copy, other than the fact that it's a town full of stereo typical rednecks. You know, a screenwriter and his hot actress wife move into her dad's house after his death. She grew up in this isolated town and her old boyfriend and his buddies spend more time drooling over her than working on the barn roof they were hired for. Things get pushed too far and wimpy screenwriter unleashes Home Alone trap style hell on them.The acting is one of the better aspects of the movie. James Marsden and Kate Bosworth (beautiful, but it wouldn't hurt for her to gain 15 pounds) do the best work of their careers here. Both are very believable, as is the leader of the bad guy gang, Alexander Skarsgard, of True Blood fame. James Woods even shows up to play the town drunk and unofficial town leader with a mean streak.The first 3/4 of the movie is just a slow build up to the final 1/4 bloodbath. The rape scene isn't graphic as say The Last House on the Left, I Spit on Your Grave or even the original Straw Dogs, but that doesn't make it any easier to watch. The violence at the end is gory, though it smartly doesn't stray from realism.I would compare this to The Last House on the Left remake.

The funny thing is I've never seen the original but from what I've heard I can guess it was much better than this.This remake is nothing new at all. I am not speaking of this just being a remake but this movie is no different than a ton of movies out there. To be fair maybe the idea of this plot was new back in '71 with the original but there have been a million movies with this plot.In a nutshell a Hollywood couple, David (James Marsden) and Amy (Kate Bosworth) leave Cali and go back to Amy's backwoods Southern town to rebuild Amy's family home after her father's passed away.Of course stereotypes run rampant. I'm Southern myself and I get so tired of the same old stereotypes about Southerners. We have trashy women, drunk and rowdy locals, a mentally disabled forty-something year-old and a loud, racist ex-coach (James Woods) who still lives in the past.Among these colorful folks is Charlie(Amy's ex) and his sex-craved hillbilly, redneck buddies who make the naive David feel like they are trying to be friendly when in actuality they are jealous of him because of his intellect and liberal outlook. In other words the characters are nothing new.I didn't buy that Charlie would hang around with a bunch of numbskulls like his friends. He seemed more intelligent and on a higher plane than to hang out with such dumb hicks.So of course the rednecks do a bunch of little things that alarm the couple which lead to one lame conclusion that I won't go into. If you wanna know, watch the film.This movie was garbage. The acting was okay but the movie was boring, predictable and idiotic. David is too stupid for words and I am sorry but James and Kate have no chemistry so neither did David and Amy.One thing I must point out is the rape scene. It might've fit in the original but it seemed so out-of-place here. Charlie really showed no emotion toward Amy. He flirted a little but other than that it wasn't like he had feelings for her anymore. So if the rape was to show us Charlie's love for Amy it didn't work.

Whatever it was about the writer that antagonized the local Mississippi good ol' boys - the tension between these characters is palpable and ominous from the start.This re-make of the famous Peckinpah movie does a good job of showing how an undercurrent of disdain can build to a tidal wave of violence. The fact that the protagonist couple is transplanted from mainstream America to the American South rather than to England is actually an improvement on the original film. It peels back the bandage of civility that often patches over the differences between northern-urban and southern-rural lifestyles, and shows some of the bitterness that is still festering underneath.However, the movie seems to lose its way as it progresses. Was there a strong, stereotypical steal from ""Of Mice and Men"" in the original film? I don't remember the town's readiness to persecute a mentally challenged man in Peckinpah's version of this material. Here James Wood flies improbably off the handle every time he loses sight of his nubile teen daughter for even an instant. Over and over again, he starts flailing through his suspicions that the town's ""mental defective"" might have waylaid the girl. Meanwhile, the mentally challenged man stands stoically as a complete innocent. While this subplot does establish the town's readiness for violence and its readiness to find a scapegoat for everyone's sexual insecurities and floating sense of failure and rejection - it generally just drags the movie off on a tangent.Then the movie seems to borrow heavily from another film as it winds to its conclusion. The film becomes an adult version of ""Home Alone."" When the protagonist finds he can't keep the bloodthirsty locals from invading his house with either brute force or superior fire power, he tries to win the day with all sorts of inventive, Macaulay Culkin ploys. I wouldn't exactly say this injects misplaced humor into the plot, but again, it does tend to turn raw realism into something distractingly improbable.Overall though, you are unlikely to be bored by this movie.",4,Shows that Getting Off on the Wrong Foot Can Be Deadly,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,2196,"['Was', 'Jaguar', 'initial', 'refusal', 'he-man', 'drink', 'bar', 'lukewarm', 'response', 'invitation', 'go', 'hunting', 'was', 'writer', 'antagonized', 'local', 'Mississippi', 'good', 'ol', 'boys', 'tension', 'characters', 'palpable', 'ominous', 'start.This', 're-make', 'famous', 'Peckinpah', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'undercurrent', 'disdain', 'can', 'build', 'tidal', 'wave', 'violence', 'fact', 'protagonist', 'couple', 'transplanted', 'mainstream', 'America', 'American', 'South', 'rather', 'England', 'actually', 'improvement', 'original', 'film', 'back', 'bandage', 'civility', 'often', 'differences', 'northern-urban', 'southern-rural', 'lifestyles', 'bitterness', 'still', 'festering', 'underneath.However', 'movie', 'lose', 'way', 'Was', 'strong', 'stereotypical', 'steal', 'Mice', 'Men', 'original', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'town', 'readiness', 'persecute', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'man', 'Peckinpah', 'version', 'material', 'Here', 'James', 'Wood', 'improbably', 'off', 'handle', 'time', 'sight', 'nubile', 'teen', 'daughter', 'even', 'instant', 'over', 'again', 'flailing', 'suspicions', 'town', 'mental', 'defective', 'might', 'have', 'waylaid', 'girl', 'Meanwhile', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'man', 'stoically', 'complete', 'innocent', 'subplot', 'establish', 'town', 'readiness', 'violence', 'readiness', 'find', 'scapegoat', 'everyone', 'sexual', 'insecurities', 'floating', 'sense', 'failure', 'rejection', 'generally', 'just', 'drags', 'movie', 'off', 'tangent.Then', 'movie', 'borrow', 'heavily', 'film', 'conclusion', 'film', 'adult', 'version', 'Home', 'Alone', 'When', 'protagonist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'bloodthirsty', 'locals', 'invading', 'house', 'brute', 'force', 'superior', 'fire', 'power', 'win', 'day', 'sorts', 'inventive', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'would', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'say', 'injects', 'misplaced', 'humor', 'plot', 'again', 'tend', 'turn', 'raw', 'realism', 'something', 'distractingly', 'improbable.Overall', 'are', 'unlikely', 'be', 'bored', 'movie']",Straw Dogs

1503525,A2EY2RBD9C3ZIR,B005TK21WQ,The Seeker,"[7, 9]","""Straw Dogs"" is a remake that was released to theaters in 2011. The genre is thriller, and the film is directed by Rod Lurie, and stars David Marsden, Kate Bosworth, Alexander Skarsgard, and James Woods.THE PLOT:A screenplay writer from Los Angeles, California named David Sumner, and his actress wife Amy Sumner, move to a small Mississippi town to temporarily live in a fieldstone house that Amy grew up in. Her parents are dead, and the property has been left unoccupied for a number of years. David and Amy go there to oversee the help in repairing the damages that were done to Amy's family barn due to Hurricane Katrina. David also plans to work on his newest screenplay, and hopes staying in a rural area will help leave him undisturbed.Upon arriving there, Amy and David go to a local restaurant for lunch, and the couple run into Amy's ex-boyfriend from high school, Charlie Venner, who still clearly has feelings for Amy and is prepared to do anything to get her back. David does not pick up on this sadly, and in an attempt to fit in with the community and make friends, he hires Charlie and his friends to come over to their place, and help fix the roof of the barn that was damaged.Soon, tensions begin to build between the young couple and Charlie with his friends.THE CHARACTERS:David Sumner - He is a pacifist, and overall a nice man who doesn't like conflict and is very passive aggressive. When conflict rises between Amy and Charlie, he tries very hard to be a diplomat. He is also an open Atheist, which makes him twice the outcast he already is in the highly religious town he now lives in.Amy Sumner - An ex-cheerleader at the local high school of the city the couple are now living in. She left Mississippi for California after she graduated high school to become an Actress. She has had a little success on a soap opera that David wrote scripts for, which is where the couple met, and fell inlove.Charlie and his friends - Typical ex-high school jocks who can't seem to get over the past, especially their teen years where they were worshipped because they played high school football. Today, they are just working-class, macho rednecks. They seem to perceive David as a cowardly, snobby, pretentious, and condescending ""Yankee"" who thinks he's too good for everyone. Because of this, they gladly enjoy taking advantage of David's timidness.Tom Heddon - The ex-coach of the local high school football team. Heddon is the leader of the group of Charlie and his friends who all once played football for him. He is a drunk, and has a very bad temper. James Woods plays this role and he steals the show in my view. His performance is amazing. He is down right scary in this movie and made me more uncomfortable then any of the other characters. It's really no wonder Charlie and his friends are so messed up, and have trouble getting over the past because they all look up to Heddon, and he is just as guilty of holding onto the past, and treating life like it's one big football game.Jeremy Niles - A mentally challenged pedophile who had previously been locked up in a mental institution for pedophila. He is now free, and living with his brother Daniel. Jeremy is accused by Heddon of stalking his teen daughter and showing a sexual interest in her, which leads to intense scenes between Heddon and Niles.MY THOUGHTS:For the most part, I am not a fan of remakes, but I enjoyed this one. Mostly because I was able to relate to it since it's set in modern times in the United States of America. I'm also from the South, and originally from a small redneck town (now living in a bigger city, thank goodness) I am an Atheist, and finally I know all about how down here, some people try to force hunting, the rebel flag, revisionist American Civil War history, racism, high school football, and church on you. (Yet still sin like Satan.) I also am aware how certain men cannot let go of their high school years.HOW THIS FILM COMPARES TO THE ORIGINAL:What makes this film different then the original film is the main character ""David"" was not the hero in Sam Peckinpath's film from 1971. He was, according to Peckinpah, the villain of the movie. In the remake, David is just a good and misunderstood man in my view who is sadly caught between a rock and a hard place, and is just trying to survive and keep the peace. Overall, the remake took out the controversy and gave us a thriller of good vs. evil.WHO I THINK WILL ENJOY THIS FILM:I think this is more of an adult film. I think most people in their late-twenties and up will enjoy it. I think some atheists will enjoy it since the lead character is an open atheist, and is judged for it by the villians who are Christians. So atheists may be able to relate to that. I also think some people who have ever been bullied or made to feel like outsiders will enjoy this film as well. Finally, I think some mature adult couples will like the film since facing conflict and standing up for your wife sometimes is all apart of having one. This film all and all will inspire some people.This film can also serve as an educational tool because rather we like it or not, mean people are out there, and they are everywhere in this world, and this film can show you the do's and don'ts when it comes to dealing with certain types of people.WHO I THINK WILL NOT ENJOY THIS FILM:I think some of the testosterone-filled males in the teenage and college crowd, and the young women who love them, as well as the adult children will have trouble getting into this movie because they will be looking for horror and violence, but in this film, the violence builds up. It doesn't just show violence and gore for the sake of it. There's no CGI, no loud music, no fast car chase scenes. It's just a classic fish-out-of water story.Kids should not be allowed to watch it for sure due to the violence. I think some teens and adults who don't like violence in movies should stay away from this one as well. I think some Christians won't like the movie due to the violence too. Some traditional southerners, and some southern sympathizers, as well as former or current popular high school kids may also not enjoy the film because it portrays them all in a very negative light. It will show a side to them that they will not like, and will not be able to handle.For the most part, movies where high school football is the topic, the characters are presented as cool people, but this film shows how some outsiders view them, and like I typed, some former or current popular kids will have trouble dealing with that, knowing not everyone liked or likes them, and that some people may even see them as crazy and/or violent fanatics.Some former or current victims to bullying may also not enjoy the film because certain scenes will remind them of their own experiences, and it will make them uncomfortable and frustrated.FINAL THOUGHTS:I think the pacing was wonderful. Not too fast, not too slow. I enjoyed the instrumental soundtrack. It has a beautiful, yet chilling sound to it which sums up some parts of the South in my view.In this film, I don't think the lesson was just another ""stand up to the bullies"" movie. I think the lesson was learning how to accept those that are different from you. Rather you're a big city Atheist, or a small-town Christian. We're all just people, and it's up to us to make this world a good place.Peace.",3,"""Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power."" - President

Screen writer David (Marsden) and his wife Amy (Bosworth) move from LA to Amy's hometown in the south. They run into one of Amy's ex's named Charlie (Skarsgard) and the tension between them starts. While David and Amy are trying to work through their problems Charlie and his friends begin to mess with David. The only way to review this to me is to think of it as two movies. The first hour and a half is pretty slow and a lot of build up to the climax. The last half hour is tense and makes you glad you kept watching. The big problem to me in this is that the person you are supposed to root for and feel bad for is David, and after ten minutes you realize he is not a likable guy and don't really feel bad at all that he is being messed with. The only person that I felt any sympathy for is a secondary character who is barely in the movie. Having only seen part of the original it's hard to compare the two, but based on the last few re-makes I would have to think the original is better. This one did have it's moments though and the last half hour makes it a decent watch. Overall, a very OK movie with an ending that saves it. The kind movie where you aren't sure who to root for though. I give it a B-.",3,"A movie where the main character is unlikeable and is hard to root for when the problems start. Very OK, end is good.

They then hire the wife's ex-boyfriend & group of redneck friends to repair storm damage done to the barn roof. The town is small, southern, loves their high school football, everyone knows everyone & there seems to be only one cop in town. Most of the movie spends its time building towards the ending & allowing you to get to know the characters which is important. If you don't understand the dynamic between the characters, the end will make little sense. Finally we come to the ending, this is where the suspense, horror & action begins. It doesn't last very long but it does end the movie with a bang. I have not seen the original version of this movie so I can't compare it. Overall, it was an interesting psychological thriller.

1503531,A3OHZODU6YHOZ3,B005TK21WQ,"Written Word ""Written Word""","[0, 1]","This movie suffers from the perfect storm of bad directing, weak screen writing and miscast stars. To start with - we are expected to believe that the hot, young, married couple who breezes into town (or back into town in the case of the wife),  in a 100K vintage Jaguar,  had some compelling reason to leave their cushy careers in LA to return to the isolated and rural ancestral home of the wife (woefully miscast Kate Bosworth).Once in their new hick town, they immediately stand out like sore thumbs with the husband (decently played by James Marsden) using big words and his cell phone a lot and the wife running around in what appears to be her underwear most of the time.  In the local bar, we are introduced to the ""straw dogs"" -  a group of has been local football stars now relegated to eeking out a living doing odd jobs and poaching deer in the woods.  Throw in the apparently alchoholic,bi-polar and over-protective ex football coach (played with maximum over- the- topness including tons of spittle, yelling and crazed body movements by a clearly past his prime James Woods) -  that it seems he may be more inclined to hit the meth pipe than the whiskey bottle.Worlds collide in a series of ridiculous events and bad things start to happen.  Examples include - wife jogs in her underwear (and oddly her bare feet) and gets upset when the straw dogs who are roofing the barn oogle her.  She then berates her husband who rather wisely suggests she may want to put some clothes on and then goes upstairs and does a strip tease for the roofers?  The story line alludes to a past relationship between the wife and the leader of the straw dog pack (Alexander Skarsgard of True Blood and Generation Kill fame) - yet it is never fully explained and who cares anyway?  Viewers are left to surmise that Skarsgard is somehow threatened by the new husband and wants to reclaim the spoiled and annoying wife for his own again?The director has to be seriously faulted for jumps in the story line and overuse of every possible horror trick in the book - murder, rape, explosions and fire everywhere!!  The most ridiculous scene is supposed to be the grand finale of ""the siege"" when the murderous straw dogs and meth tweaking coach attack the home of the wife and husband.  Apparently the straw dogs are too stupid to realize until after they have basically burned down the home, shot out every window and rammed a truck through the front door -  that they could have just entered via using a ladder through an upstairs window which of course the one straw dog with half a brain figured out.  Violence of every type ensures and I will leave you to guess what happens in the end but it won't be a surprise because the director makes it soooo obvious in a prior scene how one of them is going to die - you will laugh out loud!",2,Deliverance with good looking people,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,2823,"['movie', 'perfect', 'storm', 'bad', 'directing', 'weak', 'screen', 'writing', 'miscast', 'stars', 'start', 'are', 'expected', 'believe', 'hot', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'town', 'back', 'town', 'case', 'wife', '100K', 'vintage', 'Jaguar', 'had', 'compelling', 'reason', 'leave', 'cushy', 'careers', 'LA', 'return', 'isolated', 'rural', 'ancestral', 'home', 'wife', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', '.Once', 'new', 'hick', 'town', 'immediately', 'stand', 'out', 'sore', 'thumbs', 'husband', 'decently', 'played', 'James', 'Marsden', 'using', 'big', 'words', 'cell', 'phone', 'lot', 'wife', 'running', 'around', 'what', 'be', 'underwear', 'most', 'time', 'local', 'bar', 'are', 'introduced', 'straw', 'dogs', 'group', 'been', 'local', 'football', 'stars', 'now', 'relegated', 'eeking', 'out', 'living', 'doing', 'odd', 'jobs', 'poaching', 'deer', 'woods', 'Throw', 'apparently', 'alchoholic', 'bi-polar', 'over-protective', 'ex', 'football', 'coach', 'played', 'maximum', 'over-', 'the-', 'topness', 'including', 'tons', 'spittle', 'yelling', 'crazed', 'body', 'movements', 'clearly', 'prime', 'James', 'Woods', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'inclined', 'hit', 'meth', 'pipe', 'whiskey', 'bottle.Worlds', 'collide', 'series', 'ridiculous', 'events', 'bad', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'Examples', 'include', 'wife', 'jogs', 'underwear', 'oddly', 'bare', 'feet', 'upset', 'when', 'straw', 'dogs', 'who', 'are', 'roofing', 'barn', 'then', 'husband', 'who', 'rather', 'wisely', 'may', 'want', 'put', 'clothes', 'then', 'upstairs', 'strip', 'tease', 'roofers', 'story', 'line', 'past', 'relationship', 'wife', 'leader', 'straw', 'dog', 'pack', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgard', 'True', 'Blood', 'Generation', 'Kill', 'fame', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'who', 'anyway', 'Viewers', 'are', 'left', 'surmise', 'Skarsgard', 'somehow', 'threatened', 'new', 'husband', 'reclaim', 'spoiled', 'annoying', 'wife', 'own', 'again', 'director', 'be', 'seriously', 'faulted', 'jumps', 'story', 'line', 'overuse', 'possible', 'horror', 'trick', 'book', 'murder', 'rape', 'explosions', 'fire', 'everywhere', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'supposed', 'be', 'grand', 'finale', 'siege', 'when', 'murderous', 'straw', 'dogs', 'meth', 'tweaking', 'coach', 'attack', 'home', 'wife', 'husband', 'Apparently', 'straw', 'dogs', 'are', 'too', 'stupid', 'realize', 'have', 'basically', 'burned', 'down', 'home', 'shot', 'out', 'window', 'rammed', 'truck', 'front', 'door', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'entered', 'using', 'ladder', 'upstairs', 'window', 'course', 'one', 'straw', 'dog', 'brain', 'figured', 'out', 'Violence', 'type', 'will', 'leave', 'guess', 'what', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprise', 'director', 'obvious', 'prior', 'scene', 'how', 'one', 'going', 'die', 'will', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud']",Straw Dogs
1503532,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B005TK21WQ,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","That's the question explored in this 2011 remake of Sam Peckinpah's film of 40 years prior. The location has been changed from the English countryside to the deep south (shot in Louisiana), but the plot is the same: A well-to-do couple from L.A. move back to the wife's hometown and settle into the now vacant homestead. James Marsden plays the screenwriting husband and Kate Bosworth his wife. They enlist some roofers whom she knows from her high school days, the leader being 6'4"" Alexander Skarsgrd, a former boyfriend of Kate's character. Rivalry is in the air as he subtly tries to emasculate Kate's brainy husband and she starts to question his manhood. Havoc ensues.Although I'm well familiar with Peckinpah and his Westerns, I've never seen the original version of ""Straw Dogs"" so I'm basing this review solely on this version without comparisons to Peckinpah's original.This is a psychological-thriller and so there's a lot of drama and subtle suspense build-up; things don't blow-up until the final act, so to speak. Consequently, anyone looking for mindless action should stay away. Those who enjoy films shot in the deep South, like ""Deliverance,"" ""Squirm,"" ""The General's Daughter,"" ""Undertow,"" ""The Man in the Moon,"" ""Ode to Billy Joe (1976)"" and the remake of ""Cat People"" will likely appreciate this new version of ""Straw Dogs"" (I wasn't joking about including ""Squirm,"" btw).The conflict here is basically brawn vs. brain or Lynyrd Skynyrd vs. Bach. Some have complained that Marsden was wrong for the role of the husband since it called for more of a wimpy nerd like Dustin Hoffman in the original, but I thought Marsden was excellent in the part. This is a totally civilized man of average stature (5'10"") with an intellectual occupation who is forced to shed all his civilized conditioning and revert back to the barbarism of his ancestors. The role didn't require some uber-dweeb.I would've preferred someone else in Bosworth's role as the wife though; she's just too thin for my tastes, but it's a matter of taste. I'm sure the two men in the story find her incredibly sexy (she is good-looking; she just needs to gain about 12-15 lbs imho).After the film I felt dubious about some of the character's actions in the story: Why does a rape-victim keep silent? Why on earth is the hot high school cheerleader interested in the local mentally-challenged hunk? Why does the ex-coach hate this poor sob and why is he so rash? Etc. A little reflection will answer these and other questions. If you're having trouble figuring them out simply go to the IMDb message board for answers. In any event, I like it when films don't spell everything out for the viewer and make you think.FINAL WORD: It's nothing outstanding or anything, but if you appreciate Southern Gothic, regardless of genre (drama, adventure, horror, thriller), this 2011 version of ""Straw Dogs"" is effective enough. It forces you to think and glean answers. I should add that there's a hard-to-watch rape scene and at least one other sexually explicit scene (where you can't make anything out, but you know what's going on), not to mention the mayhem of the climax, but it's mostly an intelligent drama that slowly builds tension.The film runs 110 minutes.GRADE: B",4,How far can a civilized man be pushed?,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,3246,"['question', 'explored', '2011', 'remake', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'film', '40', 'years', 'prior', 'location', 'been', 'changed', 'English', 'countryside', 'deep', 'south', 'shot', 'Louisiana', 'plot', 'same', 'well-to-do', 'couple', 'L.A.', 'move', 'back', 'wife', 'hometown', 'settle', 'now', 'vacant', 'homestead', 'James', 'Marsden', 'screenwriting', 'husband', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'wife', 'enlist', 'roofers', 'whom', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'leader', 'being', '6', '4', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgrd', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'Kate', 'character', 'Rivalry', 'air', 'subtly', 'emasculate', 'Kate', 'brainy', 'husband', 'question', 'manhood', 'Havoc', ""'m"", 'well', 'familiar', 'Peckinpah', 'Westerns', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'version', 'Straw', 'Dogs', ""'m"", 'basing', 'review', 'solely', 'version', 'comparisons', 'Peckinpah', 'original.This', 'psychological-thriller', 'so', 'lot', 'drama', 'subtle', 'suspense', 'build-up', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'blow-up', 'final', 'act', 'so', 'speak', 'Consequently', 'anyone', 'looking', 'mindless', 'action', 'should', 'stay', 'away', 'who', 'enjoy', 'films', 'shot', 'deep', 'South', 'Deliverance', 'Squirm', 'General', 'Daughter', 'Undertow', 'Man', 'Moon', 'Ode', 'Billy', 'Joe', '1976', 'remake', 'Cat', 'People', 'will', 'likely', 'appreciate', 'new', 'version', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'was', ""n't"", 'joking', 'including', 'Squirm', 'btw', 'conflict', 'here', 'basically', 'brawn', 'vs.', 'brain', 'Lynyrd', 'Skynyrd', 'Bach', 'have', 'complained', 'Marsden', 'was', 'wrong', 'role', 'husband', 'called', 'more', 'wimpy', 'nerd', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'original', 'thought', 'Marsden', 'was', 'excellent', 'part', 'totally', 'civilized', 'man', 'average', 'stature', ""5'10"", 'intellectual', 'occupation', 'who', 'forced', 'shed', 'civilized', 'conditioning', 'revert', 'back', 'barbarism', 'ancestors', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'require', 'uber-dweeb.I', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'someone', 'else', 'Bosworth', 'role', 'wife', 'just', 'too', 'thin', 'tastes', 'matter', 'taste', ""'m"", 'sure', 'two', 'men', 'story', 'find', 'incredibly', 'sexy', 'good-looking', 'just', 'gain', '12-15', 'lbs', 'imho', '.After', 'film', 'felt', 'dubious', 'character', 'actions', 'story', 'Why', 'rape-victim', 'keep', 'silent', 'Why', 'earth', 'hot', 'high', 'school', 'cheerleader', 'interested', 'local', 'mentally-challenged', 'hunk', 'Why', 'ex-coach', 'hate', 'poor', 'sob', 'why', 'so', 'rash', 'Etc', 'little', 'reflection', 'will', 'answer', 'other', 'questions', ""'re"", 'having', 'trouble', 'figuring', 'out', 'simply', 'go', 'IMDb', 'message', 'board', 'answers', 'event', 'like', 'when', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'spell', 'everything', 'out', 'viewer', 'make', 'think.FINAL', 'WORD', 'nothing', 'outstanding', 'anything', 'appreciate', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'regardless', 'genre', 'drama', 'adventure', 'horror', 'thriller', '2011', 'version', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'effective', 'enough', 'think', 'glean', 'answers', 'should', 'add', 'hard-to-watch', 'rape', 'scene', 'least', 'one', 'other', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'scene', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'anything', 'out', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'not', 'mention', 'mayhem', 'climax', 'mostly', 'intelligent', 'drama', 'slowly', 'tension.The', 'film', '110', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B']",Straw Dogs

I've never seen the original so this review is going to be specifically about this movie.  I liked it.Seriously I liked it.  The characters are good, the motivation of each character is believable, and the situations are realistic enough that it could actually happen.My only complaints about this movie are about the two female characters.  The cheerleader girl and the wife of the main character.***SPOILERS***The cheerleader flirts with the mentally retarded guy even though she knows it'll get him in trouble and he'll get the crap beaten outta him by her father and the other washed up football guys.  It's like she gets off on seeing him get his ass kicked.  Also it's kinda confusing as to if he kills her by accident when he puts his hands over her face to stop her from screaming.  I know her feet stop moving, but is that cuz she passed out or because she died?  It's just a minor point of confusion but still I'd like a little clarity.Also the wife is just plain annoying.  In one scene she tells her husband that the former football heroes were drooling over her outside and that it was making her uncomfortable and asked him to do something about it.  Yet then she goes upstairs and flashes her breasts to the same people who were just making her feel so uncomfortable.  You can't have your cake and eat it too, either you're not comfortable with them starring at you, or you are.Then later they rape her and she yells at her husband calling him a coward and that he's not a real man.  He wasn't even there when she was raped, and if she's mad at anyone, why isn't she mad at herself for flashing them, and mad at the people who actually raped her rather than be mad at someone who wasn't even there when it happened?  Also the football guys had taken the husband out ""hunting"" to get him away from his wife.  She grew up in the area and she should have said, ""Ummm, honey, it's not hunting season and you don't have a hunting license, plus I'm not comfortable with you being with them, please stay home with me.""***END SPOILERS***Even with those minor complaints, this movie is still worth seeing.Check it out!",3,Pretty Good,1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,2234,"['Okay', 'so', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'comparing', 'original', 'version', 'saying', 'good', 'comparison', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'review', 'going', 'be', 'specifically', 'movie', 'liked', 'it.Seriously', 'liked', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'motivation', 'character', 'believable', 'situations', 'are', 'realistic', 'enough', 'could', 'actually', 'happen.My', 'only', 'complaints', 'movie', 'are', 'two', 'female', 'characters', 'cheerleader', 'girl', 'wife', 'main', 'character', '***SPOILERS***The', 'cheerleader', 'flirts', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'guy', 'even', ""'ll"", 'get', 'trouble', ""'ll"", 'get', 'crap', 'beaten', 'father', 'other', 'washed', 'up', 'football', 'guys', 'off', 'seeing', 'get', 'ass', 'kicked', 'Also', 'kinda', 'confusing', 'accident', 'when', 'hands', 'face', 'stop', 'screaming', 'know', 'feet', 'stop', 'moving', 'cuz', 'passed', 'out', 'died', 'just', 'minor', 'point', 'confusion', 'still', ""'d"", 'like', 'little', 'clarity.Also', 'wife', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'one', 'scene', 'husband', 'former', 'football', 'heroes', 'were', 'drooling', 'outside', 'was', 'making', 'uncomfortable', 'asked', 'do', 'something', 'then', 'upstairs', 'breasts', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'making', 'feel', 'so', 'uncomfortable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'either', ""'re"", 'not', 'comfortable', 'starring', 'are.Then', 'later', 'rape', 'husband', 'calling', 'coward', 'not', 'real', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'when', 'was', 'raped', 'mad', 'anyone', 'why', ""n't"", 'mad', 'flashing', 'mad', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'raped', 'rather', 'be', 'mad', 'someone', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'when', 'happened', 'Also', 'football', 'guys', 'had', 'taken', 'husband', 'hunting', 'get', 'away', 'wife', 'grew', 'up', 'area', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'Ummm', 'honey', 'not', 'hunting', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'hunting', 'license', ""'m"", 'not', 'comfortable', 'being', 'please', 'stay', 'home', '***END', 'SPOILERS***Even', 'minor', 'complaints', 'movie', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing.Check', 'out']",Straw Dogs
