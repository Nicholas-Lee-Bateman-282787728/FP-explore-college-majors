To me the gulf between Downton and Upstairs could be measured in miles so I dismissed the review. Downton is a rare gem that occurs only when story, acting, direction, set/production, and all those other ineffable, hard to quantify qualities come together to make *magic*. That series stands alone. I had just come down from watching first Downton and then the good but not great current rendition of Upstairs when it was time to consider this series.Wow. Magic! It's here. But, it's a different kind of magic. With Downton the magic is apparent in the very first episode. Not necessarily so with Duchess. It takes a while for this series to show its stuff, but the ride is absolutely worthwhile. The lead character Mrs. Trotter (the Duchess), is a bit harsh and abrasive. They did not draw her as likeable (which is actually refreshing). I have no idea what the real person Mrs. Trotter was based on was like, but if you suppress any reflexive urge to turn the show off because of Trotter's demeanor you will be rewarded with a rich and varied tale that winds it way through the events leading up to, during, and after WWI.In fact, I would venture to say that Duchess at the very least rivaled, if not surpassed, conveying the devastating effect the war had on Britain. Regardless, the breadth and depth of this series as a whole is nearly unparalleled. An array of writers produced a far flung, eclectic set of stories such that you never know what's coming next. You are taken here, there, and everywhere as the life and times of Mrs. Trotter - and the people in her life- unfold for your viewing pleasure. By the end of the series you are in love with all the characters (I particularly loved the head waiter) and truly sorry to see it all end. I cried. I am a man, and I cried. More than once.

However, the acting, characters and story were just marvelous.All characters were believable, admirable, human, and interesting.  There were plenty of very funny quips.  The writing and dialogue were great.  There were also a few very sad scenes.  I definitely had tears during one particular scene where Louisa read a letter.  The envelope is pushed a bit with some extreme events.  Some things happen that you don't expect.  It is kept interesting throughout.This is filled with plot, not fillers.  In the first few episodes, there is enough that happens that you would see in a typical entire 3 season tv show.  While there may be 1 or 2 episodes out of the two seasons which felt a bit filler, the rest of it was pure plot development.  And it was done superbly.  I loved Downton Abbey, yet while the camera shots were newer, the acting and characters and plot pale in comparison to the Duchess at Duke Street.Louisa Trotter is an admirable yet human character, with her own flaws.  Her flaws are also her strengths.  She is an inspiration when it comes to having guts, speaking your mind, and holding on to your dreams.:::::Some possible spoilers below but I kept it pretty vague so they're not really spoilers:::::Lastly, there seemed to be some elements of this series that are repeated or were similar to other more current period dramas.  I believe the song with the lyrics &#34;If I were the only boy in the world and you were the only girl&#34; also appeared in Downton Abbey.  Also the way one maid was thrown out was similar to the way a maid was thrown out in Downton Abbey.  And a young girl sneaking out to go dancing also appeared in Downton Abbey.  And there were little cultural references that I've seen repeated in newer shows as well.  E.g. tea leaves being read also appeared in Lark Rise to Candleford.

It is based on the true life story of Rosa Lewis, who set out to become the best cook in England. She became the best in all of Europe!I bought the Rosa Lewis biography book here on Amazon. The title is The Duchess of Jermyn Street. It is truly fascinating. Rosa Lewis was definitely in ""a league of her own.""  I have never seen such a character in real life or in movies. Talk about the liberated woman- she was liberated long before her time.Every time the doors open at the Bentinck Hotel, we have another story. It never becomes dull or slow. We also get to see just how  The Prince of Wales (and most of England's royalty) can influence a commoner's life, ""in more ways than one"".... thought provoking.  The Duchess handles every situation in life with finess, intelligence and downright gall. She was a ""stright shooter"". In real life as well, Rosa Lewis kept up this unusual personna.There are some hilarious parts, especially with her family. Her mother and brother had me literally in tears. And the scenes were  serious! God forbid anyone to have such biting relatives.Gemma Jones is a wonderful actress. I totally missed her in Sense & Sensibility. She was very quiet and low-key. I couldn't believe it was her. In Bridget Jones Diary, she was again, completely different. A truly great actress.We have viewed it with different relatives and everyone agrees on the quality of the acting, the sets, plots and storyline. Superb!If you like The Duchess of Duke Street, you would no doubt enjoy another BBC series: THE GRAND. (Not the Grand Hotel movie of the 1930s.) It is similar, but completely different. Another hotel setting that is a family business. We have the ""upstairs, downstairs"" scenario again. Excellent acting, more upscale than The Duchess' hotel. Again, each time the front door opens, another story walks in. It is delicious!The Grand comes in Series One and Series Two, 5 dvds in all.

The bulk of the episodes take place during WWI and the immediate aftermath, and are, therefore, somewhat dark. They are, however, entertaining.The story slows down badly in the last few episodes, as the whole structure of the story changes.  While the rest of the series (and series 1) tended to focus on the interactions between Louisa, her staff and the guests in her hotel, the last few episodes focus on Louisa and her obnoxious, spoiled daughter.  We barely meet the guests at all. (Even The Major gets married and leaves the hotel, returning only for brief visits.)Lottie is a completely unappealing character and, to make it worse, we are supposed to believe that she is a talented singer who is 'destined to make it to the top' in the theater.  In reality, Lalla Ward (the actress in the role) can barely carry a tune -- making the whole storyline rather ludicrous.One other 'reality check' that brought things down a notch for me was the time-line. Together with series #1, the story covers a full 25 years. (From early 1900 through mid-1925.) Yet, little attempt is made to make the characters look or act any older as time passes.  If we assume that Louisa was in her early 20's at the start, and Mary probably around 16, they should have been in their early-mid 40's by the end.  Yet, not a gray hair or wrinkle is to be seen.  Mrs. Cochrane was a widow with grown children when she joined the staff around 1903, probably around 35-40 -- 22 years later she should be in her late 50's or 60's -- she  doesn't look it. As for Merriman and the Major and Aunt Gwyn ...Small things, but they do show a lack of care by the production staff.Still, an excellent series, with much entertainment to be had.

The love story between Loiusa and Lord &#34;Charlie&#34; was so passionate, complicated, and just downright romantic.  I also loved the rest of the cast, my fave being that old codger the loveable Merryman.  Be warned that the staging, sets, and overall feel of the series are stagy and a little bit stiff.  Please stick with it.  It is also a tad tragic when WW 1 hits.  The show did not shy away from showing (not actual fighting-just what happened to the brave men who returned home) the horrors of this war.  Oh, a big shoutout to the character of the General.  He sure was a steady rock in Loiusa's complicated life.  I cried at the end because it simply ended, and I was going miss all of the cast of characters.

The follow-up season does not disappoint, though viewers need to be aware that the second season is much darker than Season 1.Season 2 continues where season 1 left off - Louisa Trotter [the magnificent Gemma Jones, who may be more familiar to some as Mrs Dashwood in the 1995 version of Sense and Sensibility] has established herself as the proprietress of the Bentinck Hotel in London. There are many interesting developments in this second season - Louisa's great love, Charlie aka Lord Haslemere finds himself trapped in a loveless marriage, Louisa finally meets her daughter Lottie, given up for adoption in Season 1, Mary Phillips the Welsh maid falls in love, and there are plenty of plot twists. Also, WW I looms at the beginning of this season, and Charlie goes off to war. Louisa's hotel gets bombed, and she even goes off briefly to run a canteen for soldiers with Mary and Mrs Cochran, the cook at the Bentinck.There are many tragedies, and a number of deaths in this season, and indeed the second season seems to be a lot more subdued and somber than Season 1, but it makes for riveting viewing.
