1494591,A11635CUI3RRY6,B005MXQCWK,"Chaiam Yankel's bubbie ""Bubbie near and far""","[10, 15]","Minimal instruction in this tape is beyond unhelpful --- if you don't know what you're doing (i.e., have already had a good deal of yoga instruction), you can really hurt yourself. Tara's anorexic-looking body doesn't help things. For an empathic teacher who gives both good instruction and motivation (vs. ""good you guys"" by Tara), see Suzanne Deason'sYoga Conditioning for Weight Loss. Women of various sizes do the poses --- and the most advanced poses are NOT done by the thinnest person. Setting and music are very calming. Also recommend Shiva Rea's Flow Yoga for Beginners. This is a very beautiful DVD --- the settings are spectacular, the music is wonderful and Shiva definitely brings you to a new level of openness and ease.Shiva Rea: Flow Yoga for Beginners",2,Transformation???,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,769,"['Minimal', 'instruction', 'tape', 'unhelpful', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'i.e.', 'have', 'already', 'had', 'good', 'deal', 'yoga', 'instruction', 'can', 'really', 'hurt', 'Tara', 'anorexic-looking', 'body', ""n't"", 'help', 'things', 'empathic', 'teacher', 'who', 'good', 'instruction', 'motivation', 'good', 'guys', 'Tara', 'see', 'Suzanne', ""Deason'sYoga"", 'Conditioning', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Women', 'various', 'sizes', 'do', 'poses', 'most', 'advanced', 'poses', 'are', 'NOT', 'done', 'thinnest', 'person', 'Setting', 'music', 'are', 'very', 'calming', 'Also', 'recommend', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Flow', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', 'very', 'beautiful', 'DVD', 'settings', 'are', 'spectacular', 'music', 'wonderful', 'Shiva', 'definitely', 'new', 'level', 'openness', 'ease.Shiva', 'Rea', 'Flow', 'Yoga', 'Beginners']",Deepak Chopra Yoga Transformation: Weight Loss & Balance
1494592,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B005MXQCWK,Colleen M. Schneider,"[25, 25]","I would say this dvd is ""awesome"", but Tara kind of turned me off of saying that when I heard her use it over and over in this dvd....that would be my only ""con"" on a really well put together dvd.  I like yoga and I do it at least once or twice a week to keep flexible and to get that great ""balanced"" feeling that only yoga can provide to me.  I have never done Tara Stiles, but have done Rodney Yee, Erich Schiffman, Yoga Zone, Brian Kest, Sara Ivanhoe & Shiva Rea.  The thing about yoga is each teacher brings something unique and their own twist to this ancient practice, so it gives me a variety to fit my mood.Tara's practice I would consider to be at an intermediate level and is about 50 minutes long.  There are the normal, classic poses, chair, up dog, down dog, warrior one & two, twists, bridge/wheel, pigeon and many others.  I thought this dvd flowed really well and I loved the twists, that really helped me relax along with, (as always) the deep breathing, which is the key in any yoga program.  The dvd is beautifully shot, in a desert background and the music is calming without being too low-key or too overwhelming.  Tara has three exercisers that demonstrate the poses and she points out form but she does not do the poses herself.  For some people this kind of style is not what they may want, however I felt it really fit and it didn't bother me in the least.  The poses were easy to follow and my hubby also joined in (he does yoga intermittently) and he loved the dvd and wanted to know if I would be purchasing it (highly likely). If you can do the routine without instruction (I personally find this difficult, as I don't know how one would know when to come out of down dog, etc), there is the option to do the dvd muted, with only the music and no instruction.  Not for me, but nice option to have if the instruction bugs you.The dvd also includes a 15 minute meditation sequence.  This is led by Deepak Chopra.  He speaks briefly at the beginning and then it is quiet with only music and changing scenery.  If there was a drawback in this section I would say that the scenery is so pretty that I kept my eyes open for half the time so I wouldn't miss anything instead of closing my eyes like I normally would.  Oh, who cares though, as long as my mind is empty of thoughts and I'm relaxing, right?The dvd also includes segments where Deepak Chopra and Tara Stiles talk about yoga, breath, flow and mindfulness about food.  I found it interesting and would recommend watching this at some point to get a full picture.  It most definitely does not need to be watched prior to doing the exercises.Overall, a really good dvd.  I liked the flow, loved the music, scenery and the way I felt when I finished the yoga and meditation.  If you are looking to try something new and you have done yoga in the past I would recommend.  If you are an absolute beginner, I would recommend a more basic dvd, just to learn the poses and then work into this one.  Otherwise, I would wholeheartedly recommend and am most likely going to purchase this item for myself to add to my yoga practice.",5,Well done yoga dvd.....,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,3104,"['would', 'say', 'dvd', 'awesome', 'Tara', 'kind', 'turned', 'saying', 'when', 'heard', 'use', 'over', 'dvd', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'con', 'really', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'dvd', 'like', 'yoga', 'do', 'least', 'once', 'twice', 'week', 'keep', 'flexible', 'get', 'great', 'balanced', 'feeling', 'only', 'yoga', 'can', 'provide', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'Tara', 'Stiles', 'have', 'done', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Erich', 'Schiffman', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Brian', 'Kest', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'thing', 'yoga', 'teacher', 'something', 'unique', 'own', 'twist', 'ancient', 'practice', 'variety', 'fit', 'mood.Tara', 'practice', 'would', 'consider', 'be', 'intermediate', 'level', 'about', '50', 'minutes', 'long', 'are', 'normal', 'classic', 'poses', 'chair', 'up', 'dog', 'down', 'dog', 'warrior', 'one', 'two', 'twists', 'bridge/wheel', 'pigeon', 'many', 'others', 'thought', 'dvd', 'flowed', 'really', 'well', 'loved', 'twists', 'really', 'helped', 'relax', 'always', 'deep', 'breathing', 'key', 'yoga', 'program', 'dvd', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'desert', 'background', 'music', 'calming', 'being', 'too', 'low-key', 'too', 'overwhelming', 'Tara', 'three', 'exercisers', 'demonstrate', 'poses', 'out', 'form', 'not', 'do', 'poses', 'people', 'kind', 'style', 'not', 'what', 'may', 'want', 'however', 'felt', 'really', 'fit', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'least', 'poses', 'were', 'easy', 'follow', 'hubby', 'also', 'joined', 'yoga', 'intermittently', 'loved', 'dvd', 'wanted', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'purchasing', 'highly', 'likely', 'can', 'do', 'routine', 'instruction', 'personally', 'find', 'difficult', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'one', 'would', 'know', 'when', 'come', 'down', 'dog', 'etc', 'option', 'do', 'dvd', 'muted', 'only', 'music', 'instruction', 'Not', 'nice', 'option', 'have', 'instruction', 'dvd', 'also', '15', 'minute', 'meditation', 'sequence', 'led', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'briefly', 'beginning', 'then', 'quiet', 'only', 'music', 'changing', 'scenery', 'was', 'drawback', 'section', 'would', 'say', 'scenery', 'so', 'pretty', 'kept', 'eyes', 'open', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything', 'instead', 'closing', 'eyes', 'normally', 'would', 'Oh', 'who', 'though', 'as', 'long', 'mind', 'empty', 'thoughts', ""'m"", 'relaxing', 'right', 'dvd', 'also', 'segments', 'where', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'Tara', 'Stiles', 'talk', 'yoga', 'breath', 'flow', 'mindfulness', 'food', 'found', 'interesting', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'point', 'get', 'full', 'picture', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'watched', 'prior', 'doing', 'exercises.Overall', 'really', 'good', 'dvd', 'liked', 'flow', 'loved', 'music', 'scenery', 'way', 'felt', 'when', 'finished', 'yoga', 'meditation', 'are', 'looking', 'try', 'something', 'new', 'have', 'done', 'yoga', 'past', 'would', 'recommend', 'are', 'absolute', 'beginner', 'would', 'recommend', 'more', 'basic', 'dvd', 'just', 'learn', 'poses', 'then', 'work', 'one', 'Otherwise', 'would', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'am', 'most', 'likely', 'going', 'purchase', 'item', 'add', 'yoga', 'practice']",Deepak Chopra Yoga Transformation: Weight Loss & Balance

I have not done the meditation so cannot speak to that yet.Tara Stiles leads the ""class"" live rather than via voiceover.  The class takes place outside with three participants.It is 50 minutes long but the last 5 minutes is Savasanna.Poses I remember are: thread the needle, warrior 2, warrior 1, low lunge, reverse warrior, chair, tree, squat, side planks, bridge, half pigeon and regular pigeon, and lots of twists.  There are also a lot of chatarungas and upward facing dogs, downward facing dogs, and standing forward bends.  There are a lot of variations and modifications mentioned.  The music is very very mellow.The flow is very nice but you do work up a little sweat.  Some poses I noticed not included are: crow,  warrior 3, pose of the dancer, boat, bow, eagle, balancing stick, shoulder stands, and plow.I think this is much more doable than the new york sessions from Tara Stiles and I can't wait to try the other new one she came out with this past Tuesday.
