1508295,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0060ZJ7AI,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","The Ides of March, 2011 filmThe movie begins with a rehearsal in an empty auditorium. There is a primary election between Governor Morris and Senator Pullman. Morris speaks about his beliefs. Who will win? Morris has a good record as governor. Does an opponent have questionable investments in a foreign country? This talk seems boring. A Senator is asked for his endorsement and delegates. They talk about ""National Service"" as a vote getter. [Cynical?] Advisor Steven gets a phone call from another insider. Its important. Is there a trick here? Talk show announcers on the radio are paid to promote the opponent. Will he take the offer? Morris talks against the death penalty (self-defeating?). Two workers talk about the law. There is talk about the polling numbers. Paul believes in what he supports. [Does he have a future?]Morris talks about economics, where taxes were raised on everyone to benefit the rich. Then a fantasy about cars without internal combustion engines! Will he make a deal to win the nomination? [Is that unknown in politics?] Molly gets a telephone call at 2:30 am. ""What's going on?"" Molly tells about her secret. A reporter questions Steven about his meeting with Duffy. Who leaked the story? Molly is given money as a pay-off. Paul leaked the item to get rid of Steven! He explains why he values loyalty. Molly learns the news about Steven. Will her past actions have consequences? Steven goes to see Duffy. What if he has something big? Duffy explains his strategy, a win-win for him. ""Do you know her?"" A cell phone recorded Molly's last words.Thompson offers his deal to Steven: his delegates for a Cabinet post. Morris speaks to the press. Steven makes a call from Molly's cell phone. Later he meets Morris and asks for changes. Steven talks frankly, ""she left a note"". They talk about their status. ""It's your call."" Paul gets the news. He sees Steven at the funeral. Thompson backs Morris. Morris' talk to the audience uses the usual rhetoric and clich&eacute;s. A new intern arrives. [Are they fungible?] Steven's plan works. [The story of Molly is a warning for others.]When Paul opposed making a deal so Morris could win I figured he was going away. Its like some murder mystery where a rich, powerful, and nasty person will become the murder victim. It may not be real life, but a good lesson for having good manners. Some of the language seems unnecessarily crude, as if it was for shock value, or to mask the dull spots in this drama. Deals to win elections go back to the 1820s. Any contrary story you were told in grammar or high school was just fiction. This story comes from a play, but has parts copied from reality. [How many did you count?] Was Morris portrayed as a hypocrite? Was that its message? What if Morris was really the Best Man compared to his opponent? Its easy to rig a piece of fiction. Note how the economy is never mentioned.",3,A Drama about Politics,1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,2891,"['Ides', 'March', '2011', 'filmThe', 'movie', 'rehearsal', 'empty', 'auditorium', 'primary', 'election', 'Governor', 'Morris', 'Senator', 'Pullman', 'Morris', 'beliefs', 'Who', 'will', 'win', 'Morris', 'good', 'record', 'governor', 'opponent', 'have', 'questionable', 'investments', 'foreign', 'country', 'talk', 'boring', 'Senator', 'asked', 'endorsement', 'delegates', 'talk', 'National', 'Service', 'vote', 'getter', '[', 'Cynical', ']', 'Advisor', 'Steven', 'phone', 'call', 'insider', 'important', 'there', 'trick', 'here', 'Talk', 'show', 'announcers', 'radio', 'are', 'paid', 'promote', 'opponent', 'Will', 'take', 'offer', 'Morris', 'talks', 'death', 'penalty', 'self-defeating', 'Two', 'workers', 'talk', 'law', 'talk', 'polling', 'numbers', 'Paul', 'what', '[', 'have', 'future', ']', 'Morris', 'talks', 'economics', 'where', 'taxes', 'were', 'raised', 'everyone', 'benefit', 'rich', 'Then', 'fantasy', 'cars', 'internal', 'combustion', 'engines', 'Will', 'make', 'deal', 'win', 'nomination', '[', 'unknown', 'politics', ']', 'Molly', 'telephone', 'call', '2:30', 'am', 'What', 'going', 'Molly', 'secret', 'reporter', 'questions', 'Steven', 'meeting', 'Duffy', 'Who', 'leaked', 'story', 'Molly', 'given', 'money', 'pay-off', 'Paul', 'leaked', 'item', 'get', 'rid', 'Steven', 'why', 'loyalty', 'Molly', 'news', 'Steven', 'Will', 'past', 'actions', 'have', 'consequences', 'Steven', 'see', 'Duffy', 'What', 'something', 'big', 'Duffy', 'strategy', 'win-win', 'Do', 'know', 'cell', 'phone', 'recorded', 'Molly', 'last', 'words.Thompson', 'deal', 'Steven', 'delegates', 'Cabinet', 'post', 'Morris', 'press', 'Steven', 'call', 'Molly', 'cell', 'phone', 'Later', 'Morris', 'changes', 'Steven', 'talks', 'frankly', 'left', 'note', 'talk', 'status', 'call', 'Paul', 'news', 'Steven', 'funeral', 'Thompson', 'Morris', 'Morris', 'talk', 'audience', 'usual', 'rhetoric', 'clich', 'eacute', 's.', 'new', 'intern', 'arrives', '[', 'Are', 'fungible', ']', 'Steven', 'plan', '[', 'story', 'Molly', 'warning', 'others', ']', 'When', 'Paul', 'opposed', 'making', 'deal', 'so', 'Morris', 'could', 'win', 'figured', 'was', 'going', 'away', 'murder', 'mystery', 'where', 'rich', 'powerful', 'nasty', 'person', 'will', 'become', 'murder', 'victim', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'good', 'lesson', 'having', 'good', 'manners', 'language', 'unnecessarily', 'crude', 'was', 'shock', 'value', 'mask', 'dull', 'spots', 'drama', 'Deals', 'win', 'elections', 'go', 'back', '1820s', 'contrary', 'story', 'were', 'told', 'grammar', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'just', 'fiction', 'story', 'play', 'parts', 'copied', 'reality', '[', 'How', 'many', 'did', 'count', ']', 'Was', 'Morris', 'portrayed', 'hypocrite', 'Was', 'message', 'What', 'Morris', 'was', 'really', 'Best', 'Man', 'compared', 'opponent', 'easy', 'rig', 'piece', 'fiction', 'Note', 'how', 'economy', 'never', 'mentioned']",N/A
1508296,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0060ZJ7AI,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 5]","The Ides of March boasts itself as a modern political thriller, unveiling the sullied underbelly in today's presidential races.  It is seen through the eyes of Stephen ""Stevie"" Meyers played by Ryan Gosling, as he maneuvers difficultly through the chaos, swagger, and rules that follow a presidential hopeful.  Stevie writes the words that Governor Mike Morris (Clooney) takes to the stand for every rally and debate.  He is an idealist, persuading candidates to say words that will cause change while sustaining strong percentages in the polls.  We join this film near the end of the primaries, where it is down to two candidates reaching for support in Ohio.  If they can favor the votes of Senator Thompson, that particular candidate will take the lead, and the dominos for the rest of the election will fall.  Helping Morris and Stevie as head of the campaign is Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), whose arch rival, Tom Duffy (Giamatti) runs the office of the opposing candidate.  Tensions are tight as Thompson wavers between Morris and rival, questioning each one's values and pushing them into dark corners.  Meanwhile, Stevie makes a bold decision to dip his toe in the rival's pool.  This, oddly, is the catalyst for the balance of this film.  We watch, at times nervously and at other times cautiously, as Stevie discovers a young flame within the polling station, only to see that flame extinguished by the man he has pledged allegiance to.  The lines are then blurred between power and corruption, and a very real, very nightmarish vision of politics is discovered.  Remember, those with information hold the puppet's string.There is no question that politics is dirty.  Every four years, we watch as candidates get slung through the mud, hoping to come out the other side with the biggest slice of our apathetic vote.  The Ides of March doesn't try to show us a glorious side to politics, or change the perception of the truth; but in the same sense, it proves that it has nothing new to show us.  George Clooney has crafted an extremely safe film that boasts a phenomenal cast, but a mediocre story.  The journey Clooney takes us on through the eyes of Gosling never quite reaches the level of lukewarm.  Equipped with odd side chapters, lumpy characters, and a twist that could be seen from the posters alone, The Ides of March becomes a cinematic oddity.  What was Clooney's goal?  What type of film is this supposed to be?  Are we witnessing the transformation of a young idealistic staffer into the darkness of politics?  Is Clooney demonstrating the normality of intern struggle with his introduction of Jill Morris?  What does this film mean today?  Or is he showing that no candidate, no matter how good he sounds on paper, is flawed?  These seem like the questions Clooney wanted to ask, but was concerned about mass audience appeal.  Which would be safer; crafting an Oliver Stone-esque conspiracy movie or a film that would resonate with the Thursday afternoon geriatric watcher?  There were no boundaries broken, no political mayhem to sink our teeth into, or any impressive characters.  His Good Night, and Good Luck (or better yet Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) was more of a taut thriller than this film.  The Ides of March had the makings of an impressive film to dazzle your eyes and your mind, but in the end it felt like a political afterthought. (or better yet, a redundancy)With Clooney fumbling behind the camera, it was up to our actors to take control.  If the ship is sinking, do you jump ship or save the remaining passengers?  For Ides of March, everyone jumped ship.  This was Ryan Gosling's year, with Drive and the simple, yet effective, Crazy, Stupid Love, it is disheartening that his worst performance of the year will be his 2011 swan song.  Devoid of emotion and scattered with reason, one could not grasp who Stevie Meyers was, will be, or even wanted to be.  A proprietor of truth and reason, this changes instantly when faced with a dilemma.  Gosling's stumbling introduction also creates chaos for the viewer because as we believe him to be true to Morris' campaign; but he is not afraid to visit with Duffy?  What led Gosling to this point of imbalance?  We need someone to guide us through a film, and Gosling couldn't keep his head above this Clooney mess.  The same can be said for Hoffman, Giamatti, and even Clooney himself.  Pretentiousness aside of casting yourself as the presidential hopeful, at least define yourself.  The ""kitchen"" conflict felt forced and unwelcomed in this film.  The Ides of March felt like a coven of bickering girls vs. a true political pot-boiler.  Clooney would have been more apt to title this Mean Girls 2.  Surprisingly, the only saving character in this film is Marisa Tomei, which speaks to (my opinion) the truth of this movie.  She plays the swarthy reporter assigned to follow the nagging characters.  She is seen bantering back and forth, a playful game of cat and mouse, when Gosling approaches her with his emotions.  She rebuffs with a great speech about not being his friend, that this was a job.  She felt like the only glue to the rest of the characters, and the only interesting character in the entire film.I cannot understand how The Ides of March received the praise that it did.  It is Clooney's sloppiest film to date, and despite the great cast, they all  walk through this film with mediocrity like it was a Tuesday at the office.  The intensity was missing, the big surprise ending wasn't there, and the emotional drama seemed to be forgotten, so it left us with just a splattering of what could have been a great movie.  The Ides of March could have been a political film that really dove deep into the world of presidential candidates, but instead it played soft, gripping us to nothing except the final ending credits.  It was a major disappointment, leaving the average viewer with too many questions and not enough answers.  Gosling and Clooney had better films this year.",2,Attack of the Political Tomatos,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,5992,"['Ides', 'March', 'modern', 'political', 'thriller', 'unveiling', 'sullied',

1508297,A17S1450Y06C86,B0060ZJ7AI,Aidan J. McQuade,"[1, 2]","In this movie Ryan Gosling plays Steven, an idealistic staffer working on the presidential campaign of Mike Morris (George Clooney) a Democratic hopeful who is beginning to look like a near certainty for the White House. A threat to Morris's ambitions begins to emerge in a tightly fought Ohio primary, which brings the principles and ideals of all the protagonists into sharp focus.Clooney directs in his typically generous fashion taking only a supporting role for himself and using his time behind the camera to allow Ryan Gosling to demonstrate further why he is one of the most interesting actors working at the moment. The rest of the supporting cast is flawless, with some of the finest actors working including Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Evan Rachel Wood and in a small but crucial part, Gregory Itzin as a Democratic leader and the father of a young intern on Morris's campaign.This is a fine, morally complex and convincing film drawing on the film makers experiences in politics - it is based on a play by Beau Willimon who worked on Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign, and Clooney's political involvement is well documented, not least with his own father's congressional campaign. The result is a chilling exploration of the compromises, ambiguities and ruthlessness behind the impressively idealistic public face of a political campaign.",4,Bloody hands and feet of clay,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,1369,"['movie', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Steven', 'idealistic', 'staffer', 'working', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'Mike', 'Morris', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Democratic', 'hopeful', 'who', 'beginning', 'look', 'near', 'certainty', 'White', 'House', 'threat', 'Morris', 'ambitions', 'emerge', 'tightly', 'fought', 'Ohio', 'primary', 'principles', 'ideals', 'protagonists', 'sharp', 'focus.Clooney', 'directs', 'typically', 'generous', 'fashion', 'taking', 'only', 'supporting', 'role', 'using', 'time', 'camera', 'allow', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'demonstrate', 'further', 'why', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'actors', 'working', 'moment', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'flawless', 'finest', 'actors', 'working', 'including', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'small', 'crucial', 'part', 'Gregory', 'Itzin', 'Democratic', 'leader', 'father', 'young', 'intern', 'Morris', 'campaign.This', 'fine', 'morally', 'complex', 'convincing', 'film', 'drawing', 'film', 'makers', 'experiences', 'politics', 'based', 'play', 'Beau', 'Willimon', 'who', 'worked', 'Howard', 'Dean', '2004', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'Clooney', 'political', 'involvement', 'well', 'documented', 'not', 'least', 'own', 'father', 'congressional', 'campaign', 'result', 'chilling', 'exploration', 'compromises', 'ambiguities', 'ruthlessness', 'impressively', 'idealistic', 'public', 'face', 'political', 'campaign']",N/A

The star-studded cast includes Ryan Gosling as an idealistic campaign manager who becomes increasingly jaded by politics, Philip Seymour Hoffman as his wily boss, Paul Giamatti as a competitor trying to woo Gosling away from his candidate, Marisa Tomei as a persistent reporter hungry for a scoop, and, of course, Clooney himself as the seemingly perfect presidential candidate who has a few secrets of his own.

Based on the account of an aide to Howard Dean and adapted from the play Beau Willimon's Broadway play Farragut North.  this story is about a democrat(George Clooney) who is running for the president but has a eye for the ladies, which is suicidal in politics. The situation is best summed up by a exchange between Gosling  ( the aide)and Clooney through these lines, ""You can lie, you can cheat, you can start a war, you can bankrupt the country, but you can't f*** the interns. They get you for that"". This is a story about dirty politics, compromised ideals and deal making through the eyes of Gosling, who not only witnesses muckraking but is eventually transformed by it.As I wrote earlier this film has the best casting, Paul Giametti, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei and George Clooney ( He directed) but it offers nothing new that we have not seen earlier.

The weapon of choice, in this case, turns out to be a cell phone.George Clooney plays a Democratic Presidential candidate running in a primary race in Ohio. His junior campaign manager, Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling), is the focus of the story, however. A series of inside political maneuvers, complicated by a love interest (the heartbreakingly beautiful Evan Rachel Wood), thrusts Meyers into confrontation with virtually every other major player in the story.Gosling plays it marvelously as the ambitious and calculating media consultant. But George Clooney has convinced me that the key to male charisma, aside from bulging pecs or piercing eye contact, is the persuasive way you jiggle your head. The head jiggle, apparently a symptom of early-stage Parkinsons, is the key personality trait which will endear all political leaders to the nation. It certainly worked for Ronald Reagan. And probably Adolf Hitler and FDR, too. Clooney has toned it down in recent years, but he's still great at it. (The jiggle.)At any rate, Ides of March is a superb political thriller, which really will give you the feeling of being nose-to-nose with the inner workings of a big-league political campaign. When things start to go wrong for Meyer, it is in an unbearably tragic sense, and yet one must remember that Meyer's life is never in danger. Even his career will survive. But someone must die, and this one really hurts.The political speeches and ill-timed applause struck me as phony, but then so do the real life speeches we hear on the news these days. The audiences are all cued up and ready to create the needed aura of consensus. But even contrived audiences don't applaud and cheer after every single sentence, as they do in Ides of March.Otherwise, Ides of March is just about perfect, and full of unexpected twists and turns, which, in slightly over 90 minutes, are made with great directness and efficiency. I was never, ever bored or in a state of incoherence.Meyers is in a high pressure environment, but under the circumstances he navigates from ethical to unethical. The moral of Ides of March is that, in an electoral system where winning is everything, the unethical will prevail, and under unrelenting pressure, morals will fall by the wayside. I think we've all heard this tale many times, but you've never seen it from the inside before, not like this.",4,"Efficient, Machiavellian thriller",1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,2443,"['possible', 'make', 'thriller', 'anyone', 'pulling', 'gun', 'weapon', 'choice', 'case', 'out', 'be', 'cell', 'phone.George', 'Clooney', 'Democratic', 'Presidential', 'candidate', 'running', 'primary', 'race', 'Ohio', 'junior', 'campaign', 'manager', 'Stephen', 'Meyers', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'focus', 'story', 'however', 'A', 'series', 'inside', 'political', 'maneuvers', 'complicated', 'love', 'interest', 'heartbreakingly', 'beautiful', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Meyers', 'confrontation', 'virtually', 'other', 'major', 'player', 'story.Gosling', 'marvelously', 'ambitious', 'calculating', 'media', 'consultant', 'George', 'Clooney', 'convinced', 'key', 'male', 'charisma', 'aside', 'bulging', 'pecs', 'piercing', 'eye', 'contact', 'persuasive', 'way', 'jiggle', 'head', 'head', 'jiggle', 'apparently', 'symptom', 'early-stage', 'Parkinsons', 'key', 'personality', 'trait', 'will', 'endear', 'political', 'leaders', 'nation', 'certainly', 'worked', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'probably', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'FDR', 'too', 'Clooney', 'toned', 'down', 'recent', 'years', 'still', 'great', 'jiggle', 'rate', 'Ides', 'March', 'superb', 'political', 'thriller', 'really', 'will', 'give', 'feeling', 'being', 'nose-to-nose', 'inner', 'workings', 'big-league', 'political', 'campaign', 'When', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'wrong', 'Meyer', 'unbearably', 'tragic', 'sense', 'yet', 'one', 'must', 'remember', 'Meyer', 'life', 'never', 'danger', 'Even', 'career', 'will', 'survive', 'someone', 'must', 'die', 'one', 'really', 'hurts.The', 'political', 'speeches', 'ill-timed', 'applause', 'struck', 'phony', 'then', 'so', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'speeches', 'hear', 'news', 'days', 'audiences', 'are', 'cued', 'up', 'ready', 'create', 'needed', 'aura', 'consensus', 'even', 'contrived', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'applaud', 'cheer', 'single', 'sentence', 'do', 'Ides', 'March.Otherwise', 'Ides', 'March', 'just', 'perfect', 'full', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'slightly', '90', 'minutes', 'are', 'made', 'great', 'directness', 'efficiency', 'was', 'never', 'ever', 'bored', 'state', 'incoherence.Meyers', 'high', 'pressure', 'environment', 'circumstances', 'ethical', 'unethical', 'moral', 'Ides', 'March', 'electoral', 'system', 'where', 'winning', 'everything', 'unethical', 'will', 'prevail', 'unrelenting', 'pressure', 'morals', 'will', 'fall', 'wayside', 'think', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'tale', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'inside', 'not']",N/A

Few of their constituents know what goes on behind the scenes. Few people knew prior to the breaking of the Watergate scandal that President Nixon regarded political adversaries as enemies and used offensive epithets when referring to them. Few people know that Bill Clinton attacked an aid and threw him to the ground during election night of one of his gubernatorial re-election bids in Arkansas. (That aid has since become a right-wing republican.) And recently, few knew at the time that presidential-hopeful John Edwards was hiding a secret extra-marital affair which is now coming out because of a court case at this writing in April 2012. The Ides of March is about the dark sides of campaign politics exposed.Governor Mike Morris (loosely based on Gov Howard Dean) is just about as ideal as they come in terms of presidential candidates. He's handsome, smart, articulate, and confident. In fact, confidence oozes out of him like toothpaste from a tube. Americans want that in their politicians even more than intelligence. Confidence and good-looks go further than morality and intelligence, albeit with one exception. Americans like to perceive their politicians as moral, especially in regards to their sexual life. As one character will express later, presidents are restricted from certain behaviors, while even doing things like running up national deficits can be forgiven. The only part which is a little fantastical is when Morris says he doesn't believe in God but only the US Constitution. Any presidential hopeful would be roasted alive by other candidates for making such pronouncements.One of his top aids, Stephen Meyers, works for Morris' campaign manager, Paul Zara. They are campaigning in Ohio, one of the final stops on the primary election road. Ohio seems to be slipping from Morris. If he loses Ohio and then loses the next stop, North Carolina, his presidential bid may be over. They need the Senator from North Carolina and former presidential-hopeful Thompson to endorse, but he is reluctant to do so unless he's promised a cabinet post, possibly the Secretary of State. Morris doesn't want to give Thompson this post because he disagrees on his foreign policy. However, if Thompson refuses to endorse Morris and offer his 360 delegates, Morris will be in jeopardy of losing the nomination.Meyers then receives a phone call from the opposition's campaign manager. Unsure what he should do, Meyers agrees to the meeting. Later, Meyers learns a dark secret from one of the interns on the campaign. Both fronts could either derail the entire campaign or jeopardize Meyers position as a top aid to the candidate. All of a sudden, Meyers becomes thrust into the center of a web of political intrigue from which he can't seem to escape.A brilliant film about the dirty laundry of politics. Star and director George Clooney is perfectly cast as the seemingly unflappable presidential candidate. Clooney in interviews related that one of his favorite films is &#34;All the President's Men&#34; which chronicles the investigation by Washington Post reporters who exposed the Watergate Scandal. &#34;Ides of March&#34; is probably Clooney's answer to &#34;All the President's Men&#34;, showing an insider's look into the politics behind the politics.

Hotshot speechwriter/campaigner Stephen Meyers.  Stephen has the experience to make this happen, and he also believes.  But his belief soon becomes his own handicap, and he finds himself immersed in the endless maelstrom that is U.S. politics.The plot of IDES isn't wholly original; it's interesting, and definitely provokes a few thoughts, no matter your political beliefs (Morris is a Democrat, but he could easily belong to either party).  However, three factors help anchor this film.  The first is director George Clooney, who has rarely been this confident behind camera (I've found his previously directorial efforts a mixed bag of goodies, personally).  The second factor is the script, from Clooney and Grant Heslov (GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK), which takes its characters through a wide range of emotions without ever becoming maudlin or cliched (well, mostly).The third factor, and the most important one, is the acting.  Ryan Gosling gave two stand out performances in 2011: DRIVE and IDES.  And the two couldn't be more different.  DRIVE saw him being basically a human android, discovering his heart (or sort of); IDES is the exact reverse, with Gosling going from a (sort of) idealist to a (sort of) realist.  The performance anchors the film; this is Gosling's vehicle, make no mistake, and he carries it magnificently.  Clooney, as Morris, is solid, but he doesn't have much to do; he's a supporting character in his own play.  All of the smaller roles are cast perfectly: Philip Seymour Hoffman as Meyers's boss; Paul Giamatti as the competition's conniving campaign manager; Jeffrey Wright as a senator around whom the whole film hinges; and especially Evan Rachel Wood as an intern who gets tragically caught up in the whole mess.THE IDES OF MARCH isn't quite a political thriller; it's more of a character study that happens to be about politics.  Can you take it as a political metaphor for our times?  Yes.  But at it's heart, IDES is a personal film about one man's realization that the world can get along just fine without him...and what he aims to do about that.  It may not become the award winner that it deserves to be, but make no mistake: it is a great film filled with fantastic performances.

Clooney shares screenwriting credit with frequent collaborator Grant Heslov (Good Night, and Good Luck) and Willimon, and together they provide some insight into the inner workings of the American political system. The movie starts out strong and the dialogue feels quite sharp, but the plot twists turn out to be far less about the subtle intricacies in the current political scene and more about classic Hollywood themes like honor and loyalty. This cautious approach results in a film that is far more conventional in execution than I was hoping it would be based on the trailers.The story focuses on Stephen Meyers, a young politico who is the junior campaign manager for the charismatic Mike Morris, the governor of Pennsylvania who is looking to secure the Democratic nomination for the presidency. Competing against Senator Ted Pullman of Arkansas, Morris is looking to lock down the Ohio primary, but his surest chance for victory ride on getting an endorsement from Senator Thompson of North Carolina, who is pulling out of the election. After a hotly contested debate, Pullman's campaign manager Tom Duffy sets Meyer aside and confidentially asks him to switch camps and work for Pullman. Flattered and understandably paranoid, Meyers keeps this offer a secret from his boss, Morris senior campaign manager Paul Zara. Further complicating matters is Molly Stearns, an intern whom Meyers beds only to find out she had a previous liaison with Morris. She also happens to be the daughter of the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. A fair amount of Machiavellian-level deception and double-crossing among the campaign managers leads to one suicide and Meyers ultimately reconsidering his ideals in pursuit of success and revenge.The performances are as solid as you would expect. Clooney effortless brings his savvy and charm to Morris in a way that makes you wish Obama could pick up pointers from him. If Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman were anything less than stellar as Duffy and Zara respectively, that would have been far more surprising. What would have been more interesting is if the actors switched roles as they would be playing less to their usual archetypes. Evan Rachel Wood effectively plays the pivotal role of Molly, bringing an intriguing mix of youthful moxie and vulnerability to her character's actions, while Marisa Tomei provides just the right level of cynicism to her New York Times reporter (...will she ever return to starring roles?). Jeffrey Wright is criminally underused in just a few scenes as Thompson, but Max Minghella (the late director Anthony's son) lends sharpness to his minor role as a nakedly ambitious member of the Morris campaign staff. At the center of it all, Ryan Gosling proves he has the gravity to carry a mainstream movie, even one as fully loaded as this one.

Gosling may be barely thirty-years-old, but as the junior campaign manager, he has a lot of experience.  One thing he has yet to acquire a lot of is cynicism about the political machine, but that will happen over the course of ""Ides.""Clooney plays a Democratic presidential candidate whose staff includes senior campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  Friction arises when it's suggested that he accept the endorsement of a senator (Jeffrey Wright) who he considers (irony alert!) sleazy.  Meanwhile Gosling is being wooed by the other side, which gives him a shock when he finds out who's actually behind it.  Also there's a pretty intern (Evan Rachel Wood) who becomes involved with Gosling and whose personal dilemma could have far-reaching effects on the campaign.I predict that this movie will get at least a few Oscar-nominations.  Like last year's ""The King's Speech,"" it's based on a play, is dialogue-driven and has a stellar cast consisting almost entirely of men.

It seems our level of tolerance for the constant bickering and mudslinging, and poison secrets, and empty rhetoric from the current political campaign is usurping our media blitz from caucuses to talk shows, to interviews, to newspapers, to blogging, to television and radio overkill.  The degree of credibility of whether what we are slammed with daily is addressed well in this polished film based on the play 'Farragut North' by Beau Willimon who also adapted his play for the screen with the aid of Grant Heslov and director George Clooney. It is a tight script, a keenly photographed (many dark and tight closeups of the characters as they show their true selves) and observed tale of corruption that helps us all understand more of why our political campaigns are hard to believe and tolerate.Stephen Meters (Ryan Gosling in a brilliant performance) is an idealistic staff member of Governor Mike morris (George Clooney) in his race for the Ohio primary against  Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell).  Steve believes in Morris' idealism and is free of corruption until he comes under the spell of the campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman, also superb),  The campaign is close and much depends on the support of Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright) who owns over 300 delegates and is holding out his support for payola as a promised Secretary of State position.  Thompson's campaign manager is the smart and smarmy Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) who is not beyond the darkest moves to manage his candidate's victory. Both camps are hounded by the press in the form of Ida (Marisa Tomei).  One of Morris' interns - Molly (Evan Rachel Wood), who happens to be the daughter of the powerful DNC chairman jack Stearns (Gregory Itzin) - is beautiful and smart and seductive and wins the attention of the idealistic Steve, a liaison that eventually leads to the uncovering of some very dark secrets that alter Steve's idealism, making him just as cynical and dirty as those around him.Yes, political thrillers such as this have been done before, but this one manages to address the issues of idealism versus greedy two-faced cheating and corruption better than the others.  Much of this is due to Clooney's excellent direction but the success of the film is also due to the line of exceptional performances by Gosling, Clooney, Hoffman, Giamatti, Wright and Wood.  There are small supporting roles by Jennifer Ehle and Max Minghella that enhance the overall drama.  It may be too frank for many viewers, but it is a microscopic view of the process through which we move to elect the President of this country - and that process is flawed and difficult to observe as it is defined here.

I liked some of his ideas (his character's ideas that is) about getting America off oil and commitment to ending that dependence.. phasing out petroleum run autos within the next 10 years, etc..The movie starts a bit slow and kind of thick on politics and the details of running a campaign.

It takes a while for things to start happening, but when they do, the show does indeed become a play-for-power thriller and is enjoyable enough.

Clooney and Gosling are both pretty great in this movie, apart from other criticisms that could be made about the film, and it is a fairly fun script once it gets moving.

1508348,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0060ZJ7AI,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[5, 11]","This is a very powerful film that does not really call for a long commentary.We are dealing with the Democratic primaries in Ohio for the presidential election of a year that is not specified, though the various historical elements situate the events after the war in Iraq and yet within a context of hostility against the oil producers in the desert, meaning of course Arab oil producers.The candidate that is shown as the future winner in this campaign is not the incumbent president, is white and strongly hostile to the use of war as a way to achieve supremacy, though supremacy is the openly expressed aim. The way is is calculating his victory can only be understood in the American context: the great electors have to be elected state by state with rules that are different in the various states. The result then is some kind of in the wings negotiations and communication warfare and it has little to do with democracy and the US Constitution and the fundamental rights of the Bill of Rights.Calculations, rumors, shady action in the wings, intimidation and even scapegoats when necessary, or even some violence if that's the only way. American politics are dirty, very dirty with such a system, and yet it is so much better than some other political organization. There is little originality in what we can say on this political system.But there is a lot more to say on three points.Sexual traps and blackmail: any sexual caper, even hidden deep in the shadow of the night, is one of the favorite weapons used to destabilize and even pull down a candidate. That is immoral in the name of morality. This is mean and absurd, but it is true that unwanted sex is too often the case between the candidate or his major aides and the young volunteers and interns the candidate may use in his team.The wild and savage war among the various people at the top of a campaign-team. But this is a game in a way in which one will destroy the others if that one can in order to achieve full control over the campaign and a battle of that type is ne ver finished: one may win one fight but the loser may call for a second fight and win in his turn: no one is supposed to be a bad loser and the best loser is the one who concede defeat and walks out without resisting. He will easily get some job somewhere that will pay for his experience and his connections.The third point that is not even discussed is the desire to bring the USA back to first position by cutting on the consumption of oil drastically and stop buying the oil of the Desert dictatureship that are Moslem at the same time. That is not dictated by any religious beliefs that are rejected from the very start, but only by the ambition to go back to the top and head of the pack of wolves the whole world is identified to.It is where the film is strangest because in 2010 or 2011 it is difficult to say that the main cause of the decline of the USA is the oil producers. The main opponents in the globalized market are the emerging countries that the latest crisis does not seem to have really jeopardized or endangered, even if it has bothered them slightly. In that perspective it would be interesting to suggest the USA and Americans to stop using any kind of high tech product that is produced in these emerging countries. That would cut the ambition to recapture the leading role in technology short and even very short, a crew cut in a way, which would lead to using the marines sooner or later to bring the emerging countries down.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Innuendo and shady facts to climb and stay at the top,1321660800,"11 19, 2011",2011,3517,"['very', 'powerful', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'call', 'long', 'commentary.We', 'are', 'dealing', 'Democratic', 'primaries', 'Ohio', 'presidential', 'election', 'year', 'not', 'specified', 'various', 'historical', 'elements', 'situate', 'events', 'war', 'Iraq', 'yet', 'context', 'hostility', 'oil', 'producers', 'desert', 'meaning', 'course', 'Arab', 'oil', 'producers.The', 'candidate', 'shown', 'future', 'winner', 'campaign', 'not', 'incumbent', 'president', 'white', 'strongly', 'hostile', 'use', 'war', 'way', 'achieve', 'supremacy', 'supremacy', 'openly', 'expressed', 'aim', 'way', 'calculating', 'victory', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'understood', 'American', 'context', 'great', 'electors', 'have', 'be', 'elected', 'state', 'state', 'rules', 'are', 'different', 'various', 'states', 'result', 'then', 'kind', 'wings', 'negotiations', 'communication', 'warfare', 'little', 'do', 'democracy', 'US', 'Constitution', 'fundamental', 'rights', 'Bill', 'Rights.Calculations', 'rumors', 'shady', 'action', 'wings', 'intimidation', 'even', 'scapegoats', 'when', 'necessary', 'even', 'violence', 'only', 'way', 'American', 'politics', 'are', 'dirty', 'very', 'dirty', 'system', 'yet', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'political', 'organization', 'little', 'originality', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'political', 'system.But', 'lot', 'more', 'say', 'three', 'points.Sexual', 'traps', 'blackmail', 'sexual', 'caper', 'even', 'hidden', 'deep', 'shadow', 'night', 'one', 'favorite', 'weapons', 'used', 'destabilize', 'even', 'pull', 'down', 'candidate', 'immoral', 'name', 'morality', 'mean', 'absurd', 'true', 'unwanted', 'sex', 'too', 'often', 'case', 'candidate', 'major', 'aides', 'young', 'volunteers', 'candidate', 'may', 'use', 'team.The', 'wild', 'savage', 'war', 'various', 'people', 'top', 'campaign-team', 'game', 'way', 'one', 'will', 'destroy', 'others', 'one', 'can', 'order', 'achieve', 'full', 'control', 'campaign', 'battle', 'type', 'ne', 'ver', 'finished', 'one', 'may', 'win', 'one', 'fight', 'loser', 'may', 'call', 'second', 'fight', 'win', 'turn', 'one', 'supposed', 'be', 'bad', 'loser', 'best', 'loser', 'one', 'who', 'concede', 'defeat', 'walks', 'out', 'resisting', 'will', 'easily', 'get', 'job', 'somewhere', 'will', 'pay', 'experience', 'connections.The', 'third', 'point', 'not', 'even', 'discussed', 'desire', 'bring', 'USA', 'back', 'first', 'position', 'cutting', 'consumption', 'oil', 'drastically', 'stop', 'buying', 'oil', 'Desert', 'dictatureship', 'are', 'Moslem', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'dictated', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'are', 'rejected', 'very', 'start', 'only', 'ambition', 'go', 'back', 'top', 'head', 'pack', 'wolves', 'whole', 'world', 'identified', 'to.It', 'where', 'film', 'strangest', '2010', '2011', 'difficult', 'say', 'main', 'cause', 'decline', 'USA', 'oil', 'producers', 'main', 'opponents', 'globalized', 'market', 'are', 'emerging', 'countries', 'latest', 'crisis', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'really', 'jeopardized', 'endangered', 'even', 'bothered', 'slightly', 'perspective', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'suggest', 'USA', 'Americans', 'stop', 'using', 'kind', 'high', 'tech', 'product', 'produced', 'emerging', 'countries', 'would', 'cut', 'ambition', 'recapture', 'leading', 'role', 'technology', 'short', 'even', 'very', 'short', 'crew', 'cut', 'way', 'would', 'lead', 'using', 'marines', 'sooner', 'later', 'bring', 'emerging', 'countries', 'down.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

The film is centered on Ryan Gosling's ""awakening"" as to the ugly nature of politics.

He finds himself being too cozy with one of the interns (Evan Rachel Wood), and all too quickly this snowballs into a complicated set of intrigues.  Clooney plays the presidential candidate, Gov. Mike Morris, with equal parts Bill Clinton and John Edwards, a Southern liberal whose major issue appears to be energy conservation.  It doesn't really seem to matter, as Clooney, who also directed the film, focuses on his press secretary's ""transformation.""Young Stephen Meyer (Gosling) finds himself trapped between two cynical campaign managers (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti) who both effectively carry their roles.  Gosling tries to be above them with a cool detached air, as if he had been watchingThe Manchurian Candidate.  The politics are reduced to the most banal level with Jeffrey Wright seeming to channel Herman Cain in the role of Senator Thompson from North Carolina.  All kinds of intrigues are planted, but they are very poorly brought together and in the end you are left wondering what this is all about.

We see a charismatic candidate in the presidential primary in Ohio and we get to watch the jockeying for position among his staff, his supporters and his potential endorsers. We're looking at a highly principled contender with a staff that's determined to win at any cost, so of course it becomes a question of idealism vs pragmatism.

He can resist the siren song of headhunters because he believes in his candidate.* Paul Giamatti (""Win Win"") is the wily campaign manager for the loyal opposition, who understands that sometimes it's easier to give voters a reason to vote against a candidate.* Philip Seymour Hoffman (""Moneyball"") runs the show for our candidate. He's been in the business a long time and understands the value of loyalty.* Marisa Tomei (""Crazy, Stupid, Love"") is a political hack for the New York Times. She has sources that would make any politician weep, but her hair looks like straw!* Jeffrey Wright (""Source Code"") commands a huge block of Ohio delegates but he wants the promise of a Cabinet post before he will endorse anybody!* Evan Rachel Wood (""The Wrestler"") interns for the candidate and his staff: she runs for coffee, delivers hard copy to meetings and generally provides a multitude of services. BTW, they need real coffee in those containers; the actors don't handle them realistically!We see the usual strategy meetings punctuated by the usual profanity but this well-crafted drama is highly watchable and entertaining all the way.

1508357,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0060ZJ7AI,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 8]","George Clooney's latest directorial effort The Ides of March, adapted from the stage play Farragut North, takes place entirely within the confines of a campaign to get Democratic governor Mike Morris (played by Clooney himself) the nomination for President of the United States. Clooney, as a known liberal, treads dangerous waters making a political film, guaranteeing that many with opposing political views will have preconceived notions upon entering the theatre. Despite what some may think and what the marketing has led some to believe, The Ides of March is not a political thriller and does not appear to have any political agenda but chooses to use the political arena as a backdrop for the broad spectrum of themes it wishes to explore. It's also a near-perfect movie that ranks as one of the best films of the year.Ryan Gosling (continuing his 2011 winning streak) plays Stephen Meyers, the idealistic Junior Campaign Manager for Governor Mike Morris. Along with Senior Campaign Manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Stephen is trying to secure a win for Morris in Ohio which will all but guarantee his nomination for President. Stephen is a very driven individual, eager to fight for what he believes in, and by his own admission ""married to the campaign."" The film follows Stephen through the ruthless world of campaigning, as he finds his idealism shaken and faces the fact that he may have to betray his dearly held principles in order to achieve what's most important to him.The Ides of March is not a flashy political thriller, but an elegant drama driven by characters and theme rather than events. The stage origins of the film are apparent in the way that not much happens in the movie. This is a dialogue-heavy film, filled with political banter, speeches, soliloquies, and declarations. It's carried completely by this dialogue and Clooney's ensemble cast who all get their moment in the spotlight.Paul Giamatti comes out strong as a rival campaign manager, while Hoffman turns in a cynical, low-key, and quietly powerful performance. Maria Tomei is more ruthless than usual as a reporter who will do anything to get her story. Evan Rachel Wood in the thankless role of a young intern shares smoking, but unnecessary, chemistry with Gosling and adds a bit of soul to the film. The presence of Mike Morris hangs over the entire film, but Clooney stays relegated to the background only to make a strong impression whenever his character is called upon. With all these great performances, it must be said; 2011 is Gosling's year. This is yet another example of Gosling's infinite range, perfectly capturing boyish idealism and motivation only to capture the cynical, pessimistic nature that his character eventually adapts. His performance gets better with every scene and, by the end of it, it's frighteningly good. If the Academy doesn't nominate Gosling for his nearly wordless role in Drive they would be forgiven for nomination his equally deserving, masterful performance here.The script by Clooney, frequent writing partner Grant Heslov, and Beau Willimon does not attempt to accurately portray what goes on behind the scenes during a political campaign nor does it attempt to avoid sensationalism in portraying morally corrupt politicians. The script is well written enough that its fluid progression and potent dialogue make up for the trivial inconsistencies. About a third of the way through, the film goes in predictable, but intriguing direction some would define as lazy screenwriting, but the film only seems to get better as it moves. 45 minutes in, I thought I was watching a very good movie; 75 minutes in, I realized I may be watching a great one. Clooney is a talented director who knows how to compose a memorable scene and get the most from silence. Three scenes late in the film, one of Hoffman getting into a car and the camera remaining static on that car for a good 20 seconds, a powerful, silent stare between Gosling and Clooney, and that final lingering shot on Gosling are some of the best scenes I've had the privilege to behold this year. This is a very well-made film.The Ides of March is imperfect enough to keep it from being a major Oscar contender, but the acting and directing will likely be honored. Despite the imperfections I've acknowledged, this is one of the year's best films. In such a tense political climate, the film wisely avoids any agenda that could turn away potential viewers and for a film about liberal Democrats made by liberal Democrats, it's a remarkably fair portrayal of the party. While politics are the backdrop, this is not truly a political film and those without much interest in politics may find something to enjoy and embrace here. This is an enticing example of superb filmmaking and acting.GRADE: A-",5,Superb Filmmaking and Acting Make Up for An Inconsistent Screenplay,1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,4795,"['George', 'Clooney', 'latest', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Ides', 'March', 'adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'Farragut', 'North', 'place', 'entirely', 'confines', 'campaign', 'get', 'Democratic', 'governor', 'Mike', 'Morris', 'played', 'Clooney', 'nomination', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'Clooney', 'known', 'liberal', 'treads', 'dangerous', 'waters', 'making', 'political', 'film', 'guaranteeing', 'many', 'opposing', 'political', 'views', 'will', 'have', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'entering', 'theatre', 'what', 'may', 'think', 'what', 'marketing', 'led', 'believe', 'Ides', 'March', 'not', 'political', 'thriller', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'political', 'agenda', 'use', 'political', 'arena', 'backdrop', 'broad', 'spectrum', 'themes', 'explore', 'also', 'near-perfect', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year.Ryan', 'Gosling', 'continuing', '2011', 'winning', 'streak', 'Stephen', 'Meyers', 'idealistic', 'Junior', 'Campaign', 'Manager', 'Governor', 'Mike', 'Morris', 'Senior', 'Campaign', 'Manager', 'Paul', 'Zara', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Stephen', 'trying', 'secure', 'win', 'Morris', 'Ohio', 'will', 'guarantee', 'nomination', 'President', 'Stephen', 'very', 'driven', 'individual', 'eager', 'fight', 'what', 'own', 'admission', 'married', 'campaign', 'film', 'Stephen', 'ruthless', 'world', 'campaigning', 'idealism', 'shaken', 'fact', 'may', 'have', 'betray', 'dearly', 'held', 'principles', 'order', 'achieve', 'what', 'most', 'important', 'him.The', 'Ides', 'March', 'not', 'flashy', 'political', 'thriller', 'elegant', 'drama', 'driven', 'characters', 'theme', 'rather', 'events', 'stage', 'origins', 'film', 'are', 'apparent', 'way', 'not', 'much', 'happens', 'movie', 'dialogue-heavy', 'film', 'filled', 'political', 'banter', 'speeches', 'soliloquies', 'declarations', 'carried', 'completely', 'dialogue', 'Clooney', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'who', 'get', 'moment', 'spotlight.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'out', 'strong', 'rival', 'campaign', 'manager', 'Hoffman', 'cynical', 'low-key', 'quietly', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Maria', 'Tomei', 'more', 'ruthless', 'usual', 'reporter', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'story', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'thankless', 'role', 'young', 'intern', 'shares', 'smoking', 'unnecessary', 'chemistry', 'Gosling', 'bit', 'soul', 'film', 'presence', 'Mike', 'Morris', 'entire', 'film', 'Clooney', 'relegated', 'background', 'only', 'make', 'strong', 'impression', 'whenever', 'character', 'called', 'upon', 'great', 'performances', 'must', 'be', 'said', '2011', 'Gosling', 'year', 'yet', 'example', 'Gosling', 'infinite', 'range', 'perfectly', 'capturing', 'boyish', 'idealism', 'motivation', 'only', 'capture', 'cynical', 'pessimistic', 'nature', 'character', 'eventually', 'performance', 'better', 'scene', 'end', 'frighteningly', 'good', 'Academy', ""n't"", 'nominate', 'Gosling', 'nearly', 'wordless', 'role', 'Drive', 'would', 'be', 'forgiven', 'nomination', 'equally', 'deserving', 'masterful', 'performance', 'here.The', 'script', 'Clooney', 'frequent', 'writing', 'partner', 'Grant', 'Heslov', 'Beau', 'Willimon', 'not', 'attempt', 'accurately', 'portray', 'what', 'scenes', 'political', 'campaign', 'attempt', 'avoid', 'sensationalism', 'portraying', 'morally', 'corrupt', 'politicians', 'script', 'well', 'written', 'enough', 'fluid', 'progression', 'potent', 'dialogue', 'make', 'up', 'trivial', 'inconsistencies', 'third', 'way', 'film', 'predictable', 'intriguing', 'direction', 'would', 'define', 'lazy', 'screenwriting', 'film', 'only', 'get', 'better', '45', 'minutes', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'very', 'good', 'movie', '75', 'minutes', 'realized', 'may', 'be', 'watching', 'great', 'one', 'Clooney', 'talented', 'director', 'who', 'how', 'compose', 'memorable', 'scene', 'get', 'most', 'silence', 'Three', 'scenes', 'late', 'film', 'one', 'Hoffman', 'getting', 'car', 'camera', 'remaining', 'static', 'car', 'good', '20', 'seconds', 'powerful', 'silent', 'stare', 'Gosling', 'Clooney', 'final', 'lingering', 'shot', 'Gosling', 'are', 'best', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'had', 'privilege', 'behold', 'year', 'very', 'well-made', 'film.The', 'Ides', 'March', 'imperfect', 'enough', 'keep', 'being', 'major', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'acting', 'directing', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'honored', 'imperfections', ""'ve"", 'acknowledged', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'films', 'such', 'tense', 'political', 'climate', 'film', 'wisely', 'agenda', 'could', 'turn', 'away', 'potential', 'viewers', 'film', 'liberal', 'Democrats', 'made', 'liberal', 'Democrats', 'remarkably', 'fair', 'portrayal', 'party', 'politics', 'are', 'backdrop', 'not', 'truly', 'political', 'film', 'much', 'interest', 'politics', 'may', 'find', 'something', 'enjoy', 'embrace', 'here', 'enticing', 'example', 'superb', 'filmmaking', 'acting.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

1508359,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B0060ZJ7AI,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[7, 11]","Spoiler alert: This review reveals plot details.This is not a story of success or failure. This is not a love story or one of romantic revenge. Nor is it a war story, or chase, or crime drama-- But, in a way, it is all these things. ""The Ides of March"" is exactly what the title indicates: the story of the devolution of an idealist. Like Brutus before him, Steven Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is the idealist who adheres to a positive political agenda of his candidate-and-boss-in-one. His beliefs are assailed through a young campaign worker, an intern, if you will. Yes, an intern and all the inherent dangers that crowd this position.Ryan Gosling is one of the finest young actors working today in film (as I have proclaimed in another review, that ofBlue Valentine). He possesses a studied intensity portrayed to perfection. Much of his acting in this film is facial performance. The viewer must watch this assistant campaign manager, whose ideals match exactly with the candidate for President, Mike Morris, whose behavior gradually reveals that he has things in common with former President Bill Clinton.The director is George Clooney, who uses foreshadowing, literary devices, musical patterns, light and shadow, and finely-tuned acting to reveal both a devolution of belief and the standard, expected betrayal of character by the candidate. Marisa Tomei, as a highly acclaimed reporter, even warns Steven that ""he [Morris/Clooney] will disappoint you."" Of course, she is right.In fact, the downright most effective scene is the horrifying portrayal of the candidate's corrupt nature in a late night meeting. Director Clooney uses light and shadow on his own face to make that handsome face appear grotesque and frightening. Later, when Morris wears his dazzling smile, the viewer can no longer see him as handsome, but as a gargoyle-like being. To some extent, everyone wears a mask of some sort. Peel off that public mask and there's a degree of evil in all humans. Apparently, Clooney believes this really true of political persons.Behind many scenes which anticipate more revelations of unconscionable character and shady doings, Clooney uses a musical pairing of timpani and violins--the lows and highs (more or less) which exude frisson, a French word referring to that primitive raising of hair on one's neck. This same pairing in the closing credits suggests the repetitive pattern of anticipation, betrayal, anticipation, betrayal, so common in life.Even the advertisement itself is another of Clooney's clever use of contrast. Note the wide-eyed innocence of Steven's face and the darker, more twisted brow of the candidate. Physical appearance is both revelatory and deceptive, just as characters, just as life.The more subtle or blatant foreshadowing (depending upon the viewer's knowledge of Shakespeare and Roman history) Clooney uses is the title itself, ""The Ides of March,"" or literally March 15. In the Shakespearian play Caesar's former and current friends and political buddies publicly assassinate him in the Roman Senate. In Greek plays a protagonist dies usually from hubris, or overweening pride. Caesar's hubris was his political ambition to rule in a time of political unrest, to bring order to the country through his dictatorial rule. But no, his buddies will deny him that absolute power. Morris also has revolutionary and innovative plans to revive this country. There's a twist in this story. Instead of murder, control becomes the ruling factor.In this version Clooney also shows the ""murder"" of idealism with another layer of subterfuge by the idealist character. Steven will see to it that the Morris will do all the worthy things he promises and will make up for his wrongdoings. However, I propose that Clooney suggests that Steven, too, will eventually turn to corruption, perhaps a layer at a time.The multitude of symbols, layers of story, foreshadowing propels the story into dangerous political territory--that is, the nature of involvement, both paid and volunteer, what it means, what it can do, how it can harm, how it can help.Clooney, as director, creates a magnificent product, in some ways reminiscent of Hitchcock. His cast is stellar. Evan Rachel Wood has less to do than the men, but her role is pivotal to all that follows. Paul Giametti, as Duffy, the campaign manager for the other candidate, reveals a shocking motive for his dubious behavior in a short, but brilliant scene. As usual, Philip Seymor Hoffman is masterful.All these factors together, ""The Ides of March"" offers a modern examination of the political system through exquisite acting, meaningful symbols, and subtle, but powerful directing. The closing scene--a focus on Gosling's face--is the epitome of what both Clooney and the film are about.",5,Things never change,1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,4764,"['Spoiler', 'alert', 'review', 'plot', 'details.This', 'not', 'story', 'success', 'failure', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'one', 'romantic', 'revenge', 'war', 'story', 'chase', 'crime', 'drama', 'way', 'things', 'Ides', 'March', 'exactly', 'what', 'title', 'story', 'devolution', 'idealist', 'Brutus', 'Steven', 'Meyers', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'idealist', 'who', 'positive', 'political', 'agenda', 'candidate-and-boss-in-one', 'beliefs', 'are', 'assailed', 'young', 'campaign', 'worker', 'intern', 'will', 'Yes', 'intern', 'inherent', 'dangers', 'crowd', 'position.Ryan', 'Gosling', 'one', 'finest', 'young', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'film', 'have', 'proclaimed', 'review', 'ofBlue', 'Valentine', 'studied', 'intensity', 'portrayed', 'perfection', 'Much', 'acting', 'film', 'facial', 'performance', 'viewer', 'must', 'watch', 'assistant', 'campaign', 'manager', 'ideals', 'match', 'exactly', 'candidate', 'President', 'Mike', 'Morris', 'behavior', 'gradually', 'things', 'common', 'former', 'President', 'Bill', 'Clinton.The', 'director', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'foreshadowing', 'literary', 'devices', 'musical', 'patterns', 'light', 'shadow', 'finely-tuned', 'acting', 'reveal', 'devolution', 'belief', 'standard', 'expected', 'betrayal', 'character', 'candidate', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'reporter', 'even', 'Steven', 'Morris/Clooney', ']', 'will', 'disappoint', 'course', 'right.In', 'fact', 'downright', 'most', 'effective', 'scene', 'horrifying', 'portrayal', 'candidate', 'corrupt', 'nature', 'late', 'night', 'meeting', 'Director', 'Clooney', 'light', 'shadow', 'own', 'face', 'make', 'handsome', 'face', 'appear', 'grotesque', 'frightening', 'Later', 'when', 'Morris', 'dazzling', 'smile', 'viewer', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'see', 'handsome', 'gargoyle-like', 'being', 'extent', 'everyone', 'mask', 'sort', 'Peel', 'off', 'public', 'mask', 'degree', 'evil', 'humans', 'Apparently', 'Clooney', 'really', 'true', 'political', 'persons.Behind', 'many', 'scenes', 'anticipate', 'more', 'revelations', 'unconscionable', 'character', 'shady', 'doings', 'Clooney', 'musical', 'pairing', 'timpani', 'violins', 'lows', 'highs', 'more', 'less', 'exude', 'frisson', 'French', 'word', 'referring', 'primitive', 'raising', 'hair', 'one', 'neck', 'same', 'pairing', 'closing', 'credits', 'repetitive', 'pattern', 'anticipation', 'betrayal', 'anticipation', 'betrayal', 'so', 'common', 'life.Even', 'advertisement', 'Clooney', 'clever', 'use', 'contrast', 'Note', 'wide-eyed', 'innocence', 'Steven', 'face', 'darker', 'more', 'twisted', 'brow', 'candidate', 'Physical', 'appearance', 'revelatory', 'deceptive', 'just', 'characters', 'just', 'life.The', 'more', 'subtle', 'blatant', 'foreshadowing', 'depending', 'viewer', 'knowledge', 'Shakespeare', 'Roman', 'history', 'Clooney', 'title', 'Ides', 'March', 'literally', 'March', '15', 'Shakespearian', 'play', 'Caesar', 'former', 'current', 'friends', 'political', 'buddies', 'publicly', 'assassinate', 'Roman', 'Senate', 'Greek', 'protagonist', 'dies', 'usually', 'hubris', 'overweening', 'pride', 'Caesar', 'hubris', 'was', 'political', 'ambition', 'rule', 'time', 'political', 'unrest', 'bring', 'order', 'country', 'dictatorial', 'rule', 'buddies', 'will', 'deny', 'absolute', 'power', 'Morris', 'also', 'revolutionary', 'innovative', 'plans', 'revive', 'country', 'twist', 'story', 'Instead', 'murder', 'control', 'ruling', 'factor.In', 'version', 'Clooney', 'also', 'murder', 'idealism', 'layer', 'subterfuge', 'idealist', 'character', 'Steven', 'will', 'see', 'Morris', 'will', 'do', 'worthy', 'things', 'will', 'make', 'up', 'wrongdoings', 'However', 'propose', 'Clooney', 'Steven', 'too', 'will', 'eventually', 'turn', 'corruption', 'perhaps', 'layer', 'time.The', 'multitude', 'symbols', 'layers', 'story', 'foreshadowing', 'propels', 'story', 'dangerous', 'political', 'territory', 'nature', 'involvement', 'paid', 'volunteer', 'what', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'how', 'can', 'harm', 'how', 'can', 'help.Clooney', 'director', 'magnificent', 'product', 'ways', 'reminiscent', 'Hitchcock', 'cast', 'stellar', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'less', 'do', 'men', 'role', 'pivotal', 'Paul', 'Giametti', 'Duffy', 'campaign', 'manager', 'other', 'candidate', 'shocking', 'motive', 'dubious', 'behavior', 'short', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'usual', 'Philip', 'Seymor', 'Hoffman', 'masterful.All', 'factors', 'together', 'Ides', 'March', 'modern', 'examination', 'political', 'system', 'exquisite', 'acting', 'meaningful', 'symbols', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'directing', 'closing', 'scene', 'focus', 'Gosling', 'face', 'epitome', 'what', 'Clooney', 'film', 'are']",N/A

It is a fantastic movie with fabulous performance by famous actors: George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Evan Rachel Wood, Marisa Tomei ... as starters.I am exceptionally picky about what I watch. A friend's opinion is good, but never a deciding factor. The well-worn saying, ""You can't judge a book by it's cover"" applies here, albeit it actually doesn't ring true for books. (I judge all books by their cover.) Initially, looking at the cast, you gotta be impressed. But wait ... aren't there a lot of movies (ala Valentine's Day) that have a host of celebrities but fall flat? So far, this cover's looking mighty good.Cast aside, I always base my decision on one famous reviewer: Roger Ebert. Like me, Ebert really loves movies. So, instead of looking at what's wrong, he always starts by looking at what's right. If Ebert likes a movie, it's gotta be a winner. That's why I jumped at the chance to catch ""The Ides of March"" when it was on sale awhile back. If I had known how good it was, I would have watched it immediately. In fact, I'm kicking myself for waiting as long as I did.I'm not gonna discuss the plot except to say it's outstanding, the actors except to say everyone got it right, and the director. OK, maybe I will touch upon the direction. Clooney actually directed this film ... and he did an outstanding job. I've never been a big Clooney fan ... he's not my type ... but I have enjoyed many of his films. I'm not sure I ever believed he could direct, whereas now I'll be on the lookout for those films he does do.All I really want to tell you is don't base your judgment on the rating Amazon viewers gave it (3 out of 5 stars). It's 5 stars all the way. Anyone who doesn't agree with me, clearly knows nothing about movies.I loved it -- that's obvious, right? OK. Now for this prediction: you will, too.

1508363,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0060ZJ7AI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[8, 11]","There's nothing that I enjoy more than an adult political thriller with its smarts, scandal and cynicism front and center. Therefore, I was over-the-moon in anticipation for George Clooney's ""The Ides of March."" Director Clooney has assembled one of the year's most impressive casts including Ryan Gosling, Paul Giamatti, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood, and Clooney himself. It's a dream team and every performance is exemplary. And yet, despite the heavy hitters at the top of their game, the actual story behind ""The Ides of March"" is pretty familiar and, frankly, a tad underwhelming. I certainly wanted to and expected to like this movie, even love it, but it simply offers little new to the well-worn genre of political drama. Adapted from the 2008 play ""Farragut North"" by Beau Willimon, the narrative revolves around a Democratic primary with the standard amount of political hubris and idealistic disillusionment. It's really a very tight story highlighting the arc of Gosling's character and while the limited scope might have made for a focused play, it seems all so less-than-shocking (even typical or expected) on the big screen.Gosling plays a principled staffer working for Governor Mike Morris (Clooney) as he fights to attain his party's nomination in the Democratic primary. Taking place almost exclusively on the campaign trail, we see that Gosling's idealism, savvy, and energetic commitment have made him invaluable to the presidential candidate. He works alongside Hoffman (in another characteristically great performance), spars with Giamatti from the rival candidate's camp, flirts with Wood as a beautiful young intern, is cagey with Tomei as an ambitious reporter, and trades nuggets of wisdom with the great man Clooney. Over the course of the primary, however, Gosling will come to confront the truth inherent in our political system and in humanity. If you place someone on a pedestal, they are surely in for a fall. But Gosling must grow up quick, open his eyes, and determine if he will be defeated by his disillusionment or become complicit in the complexities of the political machine.In a year in which Ryan Gosling could do no wrong from romantic comedy (Crazy, Stupid, Love) to art house actioner (Drive) to this high profile endeavor--it's hard not to commend his versatility. Here, it is easy to see the brash young brilliance of his character, but that just makes his naivete all the more startling. The ""shocking"" turning point of the film is hardly shocking at all if one watches the news with any regularity, and yet it seems to completely undermine this insanely intelligent and politically astute character. And just as things ramp up for a turn-around, the film ends without a huge degree of payoff. I just feel that we've covered this corruption of innocence angle so many times, nothing felt particularly surprising or revelatory about ""The Ides of March."" I would still recommend the film, especially for the performances, but it lacks the groundbreaking allure that would define it as a classic.

However, the art of movie trailer production has reached its pinnacle these days, and often, the trailer gives an impression of a film much better than the actual product. This is a good example. Clooney's finest role was as &#34;Ulysses Everett McGill&#34; in &#34;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&#34; (&#34;My hair!&#34; &#34;We're in a tight spot!&#34; &#34;I don't want Fop, goddam it! I'm a Dapper Dan man!&#34; &#34;Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity. Two weeks from everywhere!&#34;) But as a director, he has a tin ear. In several places, the background music sounded as if it came from a different movie, like &#34;Nightmare on Elm Street&#34; or &#34;The Day the Earth Stood Still.&#34;Advertised as based on the experiences of a staffer on Howard Dean's 2004 campaign, the incident in question must have referred to the staffer replacing his boss right before an important primary. I don't recall Howard Dean getting an intern pregnant, who then got an abortion, and turned up dead shortly thereafter. I know the &#34;Dean scream&#34; pretty much cancelled out the memory of anything else that happened during his campaign, but I'm sure I would have remembered that. Aside from artistic license (and if I was Dean's lawyer, I would sue the filmmakers for libel), the script was plodding, with rare moments of interest when someone showed an emotion. To be fair, the film was adapted from a stage play, which usually results in all talk, no action. Philip Seymour Hoffman was outstanding as always, but the total lack of chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Evan Rachel Wood, doomed the entire production. A plot inconsistency was when Gosling accidentally answered Wood's phone at 2:30 a.m. when Clooney called her. If he knew about the pregnancy, wouldn't he have arranged for the abortion? And after Gosling took care of it, wouldn't Clooney have figured out right away that Wood must have told someone else about it?Another one only for those who have resolved to see every film ever made.",2,Disappointing,1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,2095,"['*', '*', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '*', '*Based', 'trailer', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'political', 'thriller', 'However', 'art', 'movie', 'trailer', 'production', 'reached', 'pinnacle', 'days', 'often', 'trailer', 'impression', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'actual', 'product', 'good', 'example', 'Clooney', 'finest', 'role', 'was', '34', 'Ulysses', 'Everett', 'McGill', '34', '34', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', '34', '34', 'My', 'hair', '34', '34', ""'re"", 'tight', 'spot', '34', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Fop', 'goddam', ""'m"", 'Dapper', 'Dan', 'man', '34', '34', 'Well', 'ai', ""n't"", 'place', 'geographical', 'oddity', 'Two', 'weeks', 'everywhere', '34', 'director', 'tin', 'ear', 'several', 'places', 'background', 'music', 'sounded', 'came', 'different', 'movie', '34', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', '34', '34', 'Day', 'Earth', 'Stood', 'Still.', '34', 'Advertised', 'based', 'experiences', 'staffer', 'Howard', 'Dean', '2004', 'campaign', 'incident', 'question', 'must', 'have', 'referred', 'staffer', 'replacing', 'boss', 'right', 'important', 'primary', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'Howard', 'Dean', 'getting', 'intern', 'pregnant', 'who', 'then', 'got', 'abortion', 'turned', 'up', 'dead', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'know', '34', 'Dean', 'scream', '34', 'pretty', 'much', 'cancelled', 'out', 'memory', 'anything', 'else', 'happened', 'campaign', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'remembered', 'Aside', 'artistic', 'license', 'was', 'Dean', 'lawyer', 'would', 'sue', 'filmmakers', 'libel', 'script', 'was', 'plodding', 'rare', 'moments', 'interest', 'when', 'someone', 'showed', 'emotion', 'be', 'fair', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'usually', 'results', 'talk', 'action', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'outstanding', 'always', 'total', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'doomed', 'entire', 'production', 'plot', 'inconsistency', 'was', 'when', 'Gosling', 'accidentally', 'answered', 'Wood', 'phone', '2:30', 'a.m.', 'when', 'Clooney', 'called', 'knew', 'pregnancy', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'arranged', 'abortion', 'Gosling', 'took', 'care', 'would', ""n't"", 'Clooney', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'right', 'away', 'Wood', 'must', 'have', 'told', 'someone', 'else', 'one', 'only', 'who', 'have', 'resolved', 'see', 'film', 'ever', 'made']",N/A
1508366,A2ED6TMGB6O8DT,B0060ZJ7AI,Lawrence Kinsley,"[1, 2]","Despite its serious intentions, The Ides of March is a thriller without many thrills, and a political movie whose principle premise is sadly flawed to start with, pretty much invalidating the entire narrative process that follows. We are asked to believe that the Ryan Gosling character - presented with no backstory and identified only as the political campaign's veteran idealist - would when contacted personally by the manager of a rival campaign in the midst of a crucial primary decide to accept a private meeting, in which the latter attempts to hire him away from his job. Given what little the movie's writers have offered us so far of Gosling's character, the fact that he would entertain even taking the original phone call, much less a subsequent meeting, is absurd. It would be as if, at the opening of the Godfather, Marlin Brando takes a call from the D.A. asking him to come in for a private meeting, at which he allows himself to be asked to turn state's evidence against his family, and the movie proceeds from his rather tepid refusal to do so. There is simply no reason offered why Gosling would put himself in such a situation given especially the little we know of him.This includes his relationship with the intern. Both are very attractive people who may well give into a momentary affair at some time, though one must wonder how Gosling at this particular point in a crucial campaign event has either the time or the reasoned excuse to succumb to his libido. We then learn that the presidential contender he works for has also had an affair with the woman, and we are supposed to believe that in this one-night stand the man used apparently no protection against pregnancy, and then has followed up the immensely dangerous incident with several cell phone calls. When Gosling is fired for the meeting we are to believe he was both so stupid and so disloyal to have taken, we are then treated with a descent into gutter politics at the slimiest level, with the contender giving into potential blackmail by getting rid of his long-time and loyal manager and hiring the blackmailer in his stead, all in the midst of the closing days of a crucial primary election.Frankly, if there is a `thrill' in this, it is basically at how the writer's could think they'd get away with treating the viewer so insultingly. Gosling has shown signs of being one of the best of young upcoming actors, and Clooney is for me a master at the minimal acting technique as most famously utilized by the likes of Spencer Tracy and Robert Redford. Both Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman turn in expectedly excellent performances, and Evan Rachel Wood was also highly competent. Yet they are all being asked to serve what is to me a disappointing and fatally flawed script, aimed at some sort of cheap and unbelievable melodrama rather than a serious attempt at either a political thriller or a political-themed movie in general.",2,Poor political premise,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,2932,"['serious', 'intentions', 'Ides', 'March', 'thriller', 'many', 'thrills', 'political', 'movie', 'principle', 'premise', 'sadly', 'flawed', 'start', 'pretty', 'much', 'invalidating', 'entire', 'narrative', 'process', 'are', 'asked', 'believe', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'character', 'presented', 'backstory', 'identified', 'only', 'political', 'campaign', 'veteran', 'idealist', 'would', 'when', 'contacted', 'personally', 'manager', 'rival', 'campaign', 'midst', 'crucial', 'primary', 'decide', 'accept', 'private', 'meeting', 'latter', 'attempts', 'hire', 'away', 'job', 'Given', 'what', 'movie', 'writers', 'have', 'offered', 'so', 'far', 'Gosling', 'character', 'fact', 'would', 'entertain', 'even', 'taking', 'original', 'phone', 'call', 'much', 'less', 'subsequent', 'meeting', 'absurd', 'would', 'be', 'opening', 'Godfather', 'Marlin', 'Brando', 'call', 'D.A', 'asking', 'come', 'private', 'meeting', 'be', 'asked', 'turn', 'state', 'evidence', 'family', 'movie', 'proceeds', 'rather', 'tepid', 'refusal', 'do', 'so', 'simply', 'reason', 'offered', 'why', 'Gosling', 'would', 'put', 'situation', 'given', 'especially', 'little', 'know', 'him.This', 'relationship', 'intern', 'are', 'very', 'attractive', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'well', 'give', 'momentary', 'affair', 'time', 'one', 'must', 'wonder', 'how', 'Gosling', 'particular', 'point', 'crucial', 'campaign', 'event', 'time', 'reasoned', 'excuse', 'succumb', 'libido', 'then', 'learn', 'presidential', 'contender', 'also', 'had', 'affair', 'woman', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'one-night', 'stand', 'man', 'used', 'apparently', 'protection', 'pregnancy', 'then', 'followed', 'up', 'immensely', 'dangerous', 'incident', 'several', 'cell', 'phone', 'calls', 'When', 'Gosling', 'fired', 'meeting', 'are', 'believe', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'so', 'disloyal', 'have', 'taken', 'are', 'then', 'treated', 'descent', 'gutter', 'politics', 'slimiest', 'level', 'contender', 'giving', 'potential', 'blackmail', 'getting', 'rid', 'long-time', 'loyal', 'manager', 'hiring', 'blackmailer', 'stead', 'midst', 'closing', 'days', 'crucial', 'primary', 'election.Frankly', 'thrill', 'basically', 'how', 'writer', 'could', 'think', ""'d"", 'get', 'away', 'treating', 'viewer', 'so', 'insultingly', 'Gosling', 'shown', 'signs', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'young', 'upcoming', 'actors', 'Clooney', 'master', 'minimal', 'acting', 'technique', 'most', 'famously', 'utilized', 'likes', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'turn', 'expectedly', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'was', 'also', 'highly', 'competent', 'are', 'being', 'asked', 'serve', 'what', 'disappointing', 'fatally', 'flawed', 'script', 'aimed', 'sort', 'cheap', 'unbelievable', 'melodrama', 'rather', 'serious', 'attempt', 'political', 'thriller', 'political-themed', 'movie', 'general']",N/A

That is mostly because Ryan Gosling is in pretty much every scene, and he is superb, and fun to watch. He plays a deputy campaign manager, whose ideals and ethics are challenged as the political maneuverings of the campaign unfold and get progressively more cut-throat. The other actors - George Clooney as the candidate, Phillip Seymour-Hoffman as the lead campaign manager, Paul Giamatti as the opponent's manager, Marisa Tomei as a journalist, and Evan Rachel Wood as an intern, are all excellent as well. This is a 'tight' film, with most scenes focused on the actors' faces, so it's true that there is not a lot of 'action' a la chase scenes or physical feats. This particular cast is a group whose faces I could never tire of watching in a film, so their excellence keeps it from being boring to me.As for this being an ideological movie, I really don't feel that is the case at all. It is a political drama, in that the setting is political, but it is more of a psychological drama than a political statement. Although we do see George Clooney's candidate making speeches that might very well reflect Clooney's liberal politics, considering the scandal that eventually unfolds I think it's hardly fair to say that the point of this movie is to somehow bolster a liberal position. If anything it is a fairly cynical, unflattering look at the game of politics overall, regardless of ideology. And as I said, it is more of a psychological drama than anything else, as Gosling's character struggles to reconcile his idealism with ethical reality.So if you are looking for an intelligent, psychological film with a superb cast, this is it.",5,"Wasn't Bored for a Second, and Ryan Gosling Is Definitely My New Favorite Movie Star",1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,1763,"[""'m"", 'surprised', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'especially', 'saying', 'boring', 'was', ""n't"", 'bored', 'second', 'mostly', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'pretty', 'much', 'scene', 'superb', 'fun', 'watch', 'deputy', 'campaign', 'manager', 'ideals', 'ethics', 'are', 'challenged', 'political', 'maneuverings', 'campaign', 'unfold', 'get', 'progressively', 'more', 'cut-throat', 'other', 'actors', 'George', 'Clooney', 'candidate', 'Phillip', 'Seymour-Hoffman', 'lead', 'campaign', 'manager', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'opponent', 'manager', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'journalist', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'intern', 'are', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', ""'tight"", 'film', 'most', 'scenes', 'focused', 'actors', 'true', 'not', 'lot', ""'action"", 'la', 'chase', 'scenes', 'physical', 'feats', 'particular', 'cast', 'group', 'could', 'never', 'tire', 'watching', 'film', 'excellence', 'being', 'boring', 'me.As', 'being', 'ideological', 'movie', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'case', 'political', 'drama', 'setting', 'political', 'more', 'psychological', 'drama', 'political', 'statement', 'do', 'see', 'George', 'Clooney', 'candidate', 'making', 'speeches', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'reflect', 'Clooney', 'liberal', 'politics', 'considering', 'scandal', 'eventually', 'think', 'hardly', 'fair', 'say', 'point', 'movie', 'somehow', 'bolster', 'liberal', 'position', 'anything', 'fairly', 'cynical', 'unflattering', 'look', 'game', 'politics', 'overall', 'regardless', 'ideology', 'said', 'more', 'psychological', 'drama', 'anything', 'else', 'Gosling', 'character', 'reconcile', 'idealism', 'ethical', 'reality.So', 'are', 'looking', 'intelligent', 'psychological', 'film', 'superb', 'cast']",N/A

Ides of March proves the truth of this.In George Clooney's more recent movies, he has become an acting chameleon moving with the deftness and surefootedness of a mountain goat, winning five Academy Award nominations and an Oscar for Syriana.Up in the Air I considered good though overhyped, the thriller The American, brilliant but underhyped, a personal favorite. I particularly loved his collaborations with the Coen Brothers, the onscreen chemistry with Catherine Zeta Jones in Intolerable Cruelty, and the epic reimagining O Brother, Where Art Thou?.Ryan Gosling, I consider to be perhaps the greatest actor on the planet. Nearly every movie performance he has given has been nominated for some acting award, even though many of the movies were not mainstream.

He starred in Crazy, Stupid, Love also starring Marisa Tomei, earlier this year, and did an amazing job.Ides of March may be described as a political thriller, and if you're like me it will certainly grip you and have you on the edge of your seat at times, with its twists and turns.Ryan Gosling plays a campaign assistant manager, who works for Paul played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and both work for Governor Morris, played by George Clooney, a man with eyes on the presidency.

Evan Rachel Wood plays a young intern who gets sucked into the intrigues, and Marisa Tomei plays a hardscrabbling reporter always looking for dirt to dish. In fairness, though her methods may be dubious, she is seeking the truth.Ides of March, and its characters portray every shade of dark, and you may wonder how something as innocuous as agreeing to meet a rival for a drink in a bar can become such a potential disaster, and how going on a date with an intern when you're single can lead to such complications. Certainly Stephen Myers (Gosling)is left to wonder how minor personal actions can have such potentially dire personal political consequences.I have to say the story is brilliantly constructed and told, and as you might expect with a political movie, it contains tons of soundbites. We all know that politics can be quite dirty with lowdown tricks and negative campaigning, but I don't think you have seen anything quite like this except in real politics. One persons pain becomes another persons political gain.I loved the setup and payoff of the opening and closing scenes. As the movie opens Gosling cynically delivers soundbites to camera. The movie closes with soundbites to camera.Early in the movie he has passion for his work, and says he wouldn't do it if he does not have faith in the candidate. Will he stay true to this when his values are challenged?I loved the confrontations between Gosling and Hoffman, Giamatti, Tomei, and Clooney in different scenes.I loved the sexual tension in the early scenes between him and Evan Rachel Wood.I loved the the contrast in this character who in some way cares, offering an intern in trouble a ride to and from a place, even helping her out of his own pocket, and then making the hardscrabbling choices he makes, as the Darth road beckons, and romantic ideals can disappear faster than a political friendship.While the movie does not scream surefire Oscar winner it certainly yells, and I think Gosling will get nominated perhaps even win, particularly after being so cruelly overlooked last year for his brilliant turn in Blue Valentine. George Clooney wears three hats as actor, director, and cowriter, and who better to play a smooth politician. Hoffman and Giamatti as usual are brilliant. Either or both could be nominated. In fact you will see few movies with such a strong ensemble this year, with three Oscar winners on board.I think you will enjoy it, and I hope you found this review helpful.",4,It's not personal.

George Clooney once again shows a sure, steady hand as a director, and he is just as effective in front of the camera as a charismatic presidential candidate who may not be all that he seems. Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as a young political operative, a true believer in Clooney whose faith in his candidate and the political system is about to be sorely tested. All of the performances are excellent, and two of them--Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti as rival campaign managers who match each other in sheer, Machiavellian meanness--approach greatness.But it isn't enough for a movie to be well-made. It has to involve its audience, and ""The Ides of March"" leaves its audience on the outside looking in. The screenplay by Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon (based on Willimon's play ""Farragut North"") feels slight and cliched, despite the finely wrought dialogue. It's no secret that politics can be dirty, and that the higher the stakes the dirtier the tricks. But ""The Ides of March"" treats this as a brand-new revelation, as if people haven't been watching the news (which perhaps, to be fair, they haven't).In the end, ""The Ides of March"" is nothing more than the story of a few days in the lives of some shallow, unpleasant people, who excel in con games and one-upmanship and virtually nothing else. That, of course, may be what politics truly is, and if so God help us all.

Willimon worked on Howard Dean's 2004 campaign, among others, so he should have some insight, though this story seems to take inspiration from John Edwards' campaign as much as any other. George Clooney co-wrote and directed the film, in addition to taking on a supporting role. Steven Meyer (Ryan Gosling) is the deputy campaign manager for idealistic Democratic presidential hopeful Mike Morris (George Clooney). Meyer is a shrewd up-and-coming political strategist with a touch of idealism himself, working under seasoned campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman).When Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti), campaign manager for a rival Democratic candidate, asks Meyer to abandon Morris and come work for him, Meyer turns him down...but doesn't tell his boss, Paul Zara. What he does do is have an affair with a well-connected but unstable intern (Evan Rachel Wood), as Paul tries mightily to get the endorsement of North Carolina Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright), who controls a critical 356 delegates. Political and personal intrigues ensue.This script is clever up to a point, though it would have been more fun to watch the clever characters, Paul and Tom, play cat and mouse, instead of watching emotionally unstable characters implode. If ""The Ides of March"" is supposed to be a comment on a corrupt political system, or the corrupting influence of power, or a lament for idealism, its success depends upon convincing the audience of its reality. But I didn't buy it. Meyer comes across as a nut. And would anyone put his political career in the hands of someone who blackmailed his way onto the staff? No. It's unrealistic. Not insightful. Meyer is so irrational that it occurred to me that's why idealistic people shouldn't be in politics.

A sitting Pennsylvania governor (Clooney) appears to be a lock for the Democratic Party's nomination but needs to win the Ohio primary.  The story is really about the back stage hijiinks perpetrated by the campaign managers.  Ryan Gosling is the lynchpin as the assistant manager to Paul (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  Up to this point Stephen (Gostling) has been totally committed to Gov. Morris as one who is principled and honest.  He makes the mistake of talking to the head of the rival campaign (Paul Giamatti) and another by having a brief tryst with an intern (Evan Rachel Wood).

Perhaps because of this, I did not have high expectations for this film and was very pleasantly surprised.  It's a political thriller featuring strong performances by Ryan Gosling as a young, idealistic campaign manager and by a thoroughly believable George Clooney as a charismatic politician.  The pitch-perfect supporting cast is rounded out by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, & Marissa Tomei.  The film provides a sobering look at the brutality of political campaigns and definitely makes a statement on political idealism, ambition, and the nature of relationships between the mentor & the protege, as well as the ""use-or-get-used"" relationship politics has with the media.If this film came out before the John Edwards debacle, I might have reflected on the unlikelihood of this type of drama happening in campaigns.

1508393,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B0060ZJ7AI,Paul Allaer,"[0, 2]","I saw The Ides of March (101 min.) again in the movie theatre this past weekend. If you wonder why this is still playing in the theatres here 3+ months after its original release, read on... The Ides of March is a political drama co-written and directed by George Clooney, and reminding us of some earlier Hollywood election/political dramas. While there is nothing earth-shattering as such in this movie, I nevertheless enjoyed this movie (even after this past weekend's repeated view) tremendously from start to finish for a couple of reasons:(1) the acting is superb, starting with Ryan Gosling who had an amazing year in 2011 with head-turning roles in Crazy Stupid Love, Drive, and The Ides of March. But wait! There is much more: Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are equally terrific as the warring campaign managers, and Marisa Tomei and Evan Racheal Wood also provide some juicy parts. Clooney himself is probably the least interesting part in the movie. But what he lacks on the screen, Clooney makes up for it from the director's chair as he helms this movie confidently and brings us a well-written and at times tense political drama movie.(2) much of the outside scenes of the movie were filmed in and around Greater Cincinnati exactly a year ago. When filming began in Cincinnati, there was a huge buzz around town about spotting Clooney or Gosling here or there. If you live in Greater Cincinnati, it truly adds an extra layer of fun to be able to recognize much of the scenery: Over the Rhine, Fountain Square, Head First Sports Bar (in downtown), the Millenium Hotel (also downtown), the Suspension Bridge viewed from the Northern Kentucky side, Northside, Xavier University, Miami University, etc. etc., just to name those. Ironically (or worse), the film credits as shown in theatres at the end list this as ""filmed in Michigan"", where indeed much of the interior scenes were filmed, but not much of the outside scenes. This ""oversight"" is thankfully being corrected for the DVD release. There are tons other CIncinnati-related references in the movie that will go straight over one's head for anyone not from here. Indeed, watching this movie as being from Cincinnati brought a certain ""insider"" glee that made me smile throughout the movie.

If you're not already sold on how great it is just because these three are the stars, let me continue...  This film exposes the darker side of politics and the deals that are made to get ahead.  I thoroghly enjoyed this film.  The cast was wonderful to watch, the plot was suspenseful, and the issues addressed were something to consider.  That begs the questions:  How far are we willing to go to get ahead?  How much do we want opeople to know about the mechenations of our acent?  This film doesn't clearly answer those questions but shows usone scenario that is followed.  Ryan Gosling plays a rising star in the world of campaigns and politics (he's like their Michael Jordan or something like that.)  As he helps Philip Seymour Hoffman run the campaign of George Clooney's character for the Democractic nomination for President (remember, this isn't the general election, which is a nice spin on these sorts of films), he finds himself in a sudden whirlwind of problems that ultimately leave him on the side of the road (seriously, they aren't nice enough to give him a plane ticket home...that's politics, I guess.)  Gosling's character believes he ultimately did nothing wrong (a notion the viewers can debate on their own) and plots to get himself back in by doing what every politician does...make himself more valuable (and therefore indespensible) than the other guy.  From there on out, deals are made, scandals are hidden away, and values are tested.  George Clooney comes into this film (wait, he's not getting top billing?) as a politician looking to stay honest, fight for the people, and not make any back-room deals with his less scrupulis peers...this must have worked for him somewhere along the way because he managed to become Governor of Pennsylvania, not nessesarily the bluest state in this country, as well as the favorite candidate for the Democractic nomination for President.  If you believe that his values make him soft and a push-over, you are wonderfully mistaken.  Mr. Clooney plays a confident family man and politicain who is easy on the eyes...but he's a politicain, so there are skeletons in his closet, right?  This is a film to get and enjoy over and over again.  My one complaint is that they didn't bring it into theaters on an election year.  That might have been more appropriate though I do consider the possibility of some political supporters not being thrilled about such a move...perhaps it's all for the best.

Throw in a potentially campaign-derailing scandal, some career ending mistakes, and all the treachery you imagine in the world of politics, and you've got...an actually fairly boring movie.This should have been more exciting. The actors all did a fine job. The scenario wasn't bad. But somehow, this movie just seemed drawn out and not terribly exciting. This is, basically, a story of unprincipled scumbags winning the day -- by being even more unprincipled than the next guy.

Ryan Gosling is especially entertaining to watch as Stephen Meyers, a second-in-command campaign head honcho for fallible Governor Mike Morris (played by George Clooney).

Clooney co-wrote the screenplay, a dark, cynical take on the political machine from top to bottom. Though the dramatic shenanigans in the movie don't occur in every major political campaign, the round-the-clock grind and pressure these campaign staffers and volunteers go through seem true to life.With superb acting by Gosling, Clooney, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti, as well as a few unpredictable actions along the way, ""Ides of March"" is a must-see flick if you like tightrope political thrillers. My only small complaint was how fictional governor Mike Morris spewed reform ideas that were likely what the actor who played him wants out of a president.

The film is centered around the Ohio Democratic Primary race and is an uninspired look into the filthy, stab `em in the back world of political ascension.  Of course, we don't really know this until roughly 60% through the movie where, up until that point, it just kind of seems like a movie where George can toss out all of the stereotypical Liberal talking points.It goes from a study inside a heated race for political office, where everyone is seemingly a straight shooter, to a who cares who gets stepped on while I shoot for the stars because everyone's actually a liar.

People you think have your back are actually having secret meetings over a cold Moosehead Ice down at the tavern, Senior campaign officials are leaking information, interns boink higher ups, there's deception, and who can trust who?Well let me tell you something...the one thing I trust is my motion picture intuition and it told me something upon viewing this one:  I'm voting NO to this cast and crew, baby!!I was shocked that Clooney wasn't nominated for Best Supporting Actor or Director with this as he seems to be nominated for everything he's appeared in since `Batman & Robin' (and that performance touched my very soul).

He's in a bitter contest seeking the Democratic Party nomination for his candidate. That being Mike Morris, the governor of Pennsylvania (played by George Clooney).

Perhaps the most famous was the betrayal of Julius Caesar by Marcus Brutus that occurred on March 15, the Ides of March. Thus the title of George Clooney's 2011 political drama, THE IDES OF MARCH.THE IDES OF MARCH revolves around Stephen Meyer (Ryan Gosling) a rising behind the scenes player in the Democratic Party. Stephen is the number two person on the campaign for Gov. Mike Morris (George Clooney). Gov. Morris is in a tight race to secure the Democratic Presidential nomination. It's a neck-and-neck race that comes down to the state of Ohio where Morris is in a dead heat with his opponent, Ted Pullman (Michael Mantell). Meyer is friends with Morris, but Meyer's boss is Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a long-time political campaigner and strategist and Morris's campaign manager. Despite knowing he is young and nave, Morris trusts Meyer to do the right thing and always report to him. In the midst of all this, the Pullman's Senior Campaign Manager, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti), pulls Meyer aside and tells him he wants to secretly meet with him. Also, Meyer's begins having a physical relationship with Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood), a young intern for the Morris campaign and the daughter the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Meyer believes himself to be on top of the world until he becomes a pawn in the political games of others. He's soon forced with a serious of decisions that will illustrate whether he has the true the power of his convictions or if he's just another politician.THE IDES OF MARCH isn't a bad movie, but it's not great either. The acting is superb and everyone in the cast gives find performances. Ryan Gosling says more words in THE IDES OF MARCH than he's said in probably the last ten of his movies combined. Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman are always fun to watch. Evan Rachel Wood is striking and holds her own against such a heavy-hitting cast. Clooney gives his usual performance.Where the movie really lacks is in plot. The political maneuvers of the various characters or typical and the secret that Meyer ends up having about Morris isn't something that's horrifying anymore. The elements would work better on the small screen or on the stage where the setting is more intimate, but on the larger tableau of a major motion picture, the significance of what happens and all the political intrigue is lost. Therefore, what begins as a promising political drama turns into something slightly different: just another betrayal on THE IDES OF MARCH.",3,Lackluster Political Drama Betrays the Promise of What Could Have Been,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,2578,"['nature', 'betrayal', 'politics', 'ancient', 'concept', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'was', 'betrayal', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'Marcus', 'Brutus', 'occurred', 'March', '15', 'Ides', 'March', 'Thus', 'title', 'George', 'Clooney', '2011', 'political', 'drama', 'THE', 'IDES', 'OF', 'MARCH.THE', 'IDES', 'MARCH', 'around', 'Stephen', 'Meyer', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'rising', 'scenes', 'player', 'Democratic', 'Party', 'Stephen', 'number', 'two', 'person', 'campaign', 'Gov', 'Mike', 'Morris', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Gov', 'Morris', 'tight', 'race', 'secure', 'Democratic', 'Presidential', 'nomination', 'neck-and-neck', 'race', 'down', 'state', 'Ohio', 'where', 'Morris', 'dead', 'heat', 'opponent', 'Ted', 'Pullman', 'Michael', 'Mantell', 'Meyer', 'friends', 'Morris', 'Meyer', 'boss', 'Paul', 'Zara', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'long-time', 'political', 'campaigner', 'strategist', 'Morris', 'campaign', 'manager', 'knowing', 'young', 'nave', 'Morris', 'Meyer', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'always', 'report', 'midst', 'Pullman', 'Senior', 'Campaign', 'Manager', 'Tom', 'Duffy', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Meyer', 'aside', 'secretly', 'meet', 'Also', 'Meyer', 'begins', 'having', 'physical', 'relationship', 'Molly', 'Stearns', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'young', 'intern', 'Morris', 'campaign', 'daughter', 'Chairman', 'Democratic', 'National', 'Committee', 'Meyer', 'be', 'top', 'world', 'pawn', 'political', 'games', 'others', 'soon', 'forced', 'serious', 'decisions', 'will', 'illustrate', 'true', 'power', 'convictions', 'just', 'politician.THE', 'IDES', 'MARCH', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'either', 'acting', 'superb', 'everyone', 'cast', 'find', 'performances', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'more', 'words', 'THE', 'IDES', 'MARCH', 'said', 'probably', 'last', 'ten', 'movies', 'combined', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'striking', 'own', 'heavy-hitting', 'cast', 'Clooney', 'usual', 'performance.Where', 'movie', 'really', 'plot', 'political', 'maneuvers', 'various', 'characters', 'typical', 'secret', 'Meyer', 'up', 'having', 'Morris', ""n't"", 'something', 'horrifying', 'anymore', 'elements', 'would', 'work', 'better', 'small', 'screen', 'stage', 'where', 'setting', 'more', 'intimate', 'larger', 'tableau', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'significance', 'what', 'political', 'intrigue', 'lost', 'Therefore', 'what', 'promising', 'political', 'drama', 'something', 'slightly', 'different', 'just', 'betrayal', 'THE', 'IDES', 'MARCH']",N/A

Two hot looking guys in one film - what is there to complain about? The second great pairing is of Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Another great pair. The biggest problem for me is the screenplay. Clooney is good at shooting evocative and moody close-ups of fascinating faces - here he lavishes many loving close-ups of Gosling's face, not unlike the way he beautifully photographed the less photogenic but nevertheless suave actor playing Edward R. Murrow in ""Good Night and Good Luck."" However, pretty images and well-composed close-ups does not a film make, and the tension he creates in the earlier part of the film dissipates as a result of the cliched ending. The premise itself, however, is cliched as well. Polticians are crooked - check. The pretty intern will end up in a bad place - check. Gosling will be disillusioned - check. Nothing new about the political process is being said in this film, all you have to do is read a biography of the Kennedy family, or about Nixon and Watergate, or about Clinton or Monica (the list goes on and on...). The ending, with Gosling presumably sadder and wiser, goes flat. He stares at the camera in a way reminiscent of the way Jean Seberg stares at the audience at the end of ""Breathless"" but that film was edgy and groundbreaking.

Zara wants to win at all costs while Morris claims he doesn't want to compromise his ideals when it comes down to the wire he's more than willing to do so to gain the electoral votes from a senator (Jeffrey Wright) that he despises.The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a top notch transfer. Blacks are deep and rich. Colors don't exactly pop but they are not supposed to as the film has a somewhat subdued palate. Skin tones are nice throughout.Audio isn't all that active but the film has a nice 5.1 mix with dialogue clear. Subtitles in English are provided.The cast is top notch with great casting including Marisa Tomei, Paul Giamatti as the opposing campaign manager, Max Mingella and Rachel Evan Wood as Meyers' love interest. Clooney does a great job of balancing his role as director and co-star in the film avoiding the temptation to make the film about him an dhis performance.Although well made ""The Ideas of March"" works best in the first half of the film as Meyers tries to reconcile his idealistic belief in HIS candidate and Paul with what he finds out truly motivates both of them to achieve their goals. Politics aside, ""The Ides of March"" could have been made about a Republican, Independent or Tea Party candidate and still resonate. The film could just as easily have been made for HBO as a theatrical release.The special features for the film are good but limited.

The twists in the story are contrived and clich&eacute;.  Characters pivot and reveal with the regularity of a murder mystery which this really isn't.As for the politics and political themes, the brief monologues by Clooney as the Democratic Presidential candidate are liberal but, they are undercut more than once by the comments of Gosling's supposedly incredibly media savvy character and the behavior and fate of almost all concerned makes Ides a movie that any Republican or conservative can watch with grim ""I told you so."" satisfaction.So what's the point?  Some decisions are very hard?  Politics can bring out the worst in people?  Okay, so?

1508432,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B0060ZJ7AI,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[2, 6]","The Ides of March is one of those films where you're left wondering why, given the level of talent that went into making it, you're left feeling like you've seen this movie before, so many times in fact that you can sense every twist and turn long before they finally happen. And that no matter how much the extremely talented cast put into their performances, you've seen those roles before. And given the jaded cynicism that seems to pervade the entire film, leaving everyone tainted, what the point of making the film really was.To be fair, for someone who might have studiously avoided seeing any of the myriad political campaign dramas that have been made over the last thirty years or so, The Ides of March might well come across as a meaningful and engaging film. For anyone else however, this will be derivative of any number of films, from Mike Nichols' depressingly similar but superior 1998 film Primary Colors with John Travolta, going back to Michael Ritchie's 1972 film The Candidate with Robert Redford, or even further back to Elia Kazan's 1957 classic A Face in the Crowd with Andy Griffith or Robert Rossen's 1948 classic All the King's Men with Broderick Crawford.The plot, for what it's worth, amounts to this: An idealistic young campaign consultant, Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is working for the Presidential campaign of a politician he really believes will make a difference, Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney), whose campaign is being managed by ruthless seasoned veteran Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), assisted by a campaign staff that includes pretty young intern Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood). It's a tight race against their opponent for the party nomination, Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell) whose campaign is being managed by the equally ruthless seasoned veteran Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti). Both campaigns are vying for a win in an upcoming state primary and for the uncommitted delegates of a third opponent who has dropped out of the race, either of which could be enough to secure the nomination for their candidate. And covering it all is aggressive reporter Ida Horowicz (Marisa Tomei) who is always looking for any sign of weakness or scandal that will make a good story. But then Meyers suddenly discovers that his idol, Morris, has feet of clay, and that everyone around him is cynical and manipulative, and he ends up becoming the most cynical and manipulative player of them all. Sound familiar? It should. The end.I have to be honest - given the massive amount of talent behind this film, I was expecting more. Think about it:George Clooney - Academy award for Best Supporting actor for Syriana, plus three other nominations including one as director for Good Night and Good Luck. Two Golden Globe awards and six nominations. Three Emmy nominations. Four Screen Actors Guild awards and four nominations.Ryan Gosling, Academy award nominee, two Golden Globe nominations, two Screen Actors Guild nominations.Philip Seymour Hoffman - Academy award for Best Actor for Capote, plus two other nominations. One Emmy nomination. Golden Globe award plus two nominations. Screen Actors Guild award plus five nominations.Paul Giamatti - Academy award nominee. Emmy winner for John Adams plus one other nomination. Two Golden Globe awards plus two nominations. Three Screen Actors Guild awards plus one other nomination.Marisa Tomei - Academy award for Best Supporting Actress for My Cousin Vinny plus two other nominations. Two Golden Globe nominations. Two Screen Actors Guild nominations.Evan Rachel Wood - Emmy, Golden Glove and Screen Actors Guild nominee.And yet in spite of all this talent, there's just nothing new here. It's all just a rehash of things we've seen before, leaving the filmgoer with a been-there-done-that at the end. What makes it worse is the pacing. The film spends a tedious hour or so setting things up with characters that are predictable and known almost from the moment you see them, then suddenly lurches into high gear where things are, while still utterly predictable, at least somewhat interesting for about twenty minutes or so. And then suddenly everything just winds down - the idealistic young consultant is now jaded and cynical - and then stops, leaving you wondering what the point of sitting through this was.Recommended for hardcore fans of George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marisa Tomei or Paul Giamatti who do deliver creditable performances, or for anyone who's looking for an okay political campaign thriller and doesn't mind if it's just a rehash of things they've seen before.",3,"Oscar-caliber cast wasted on tedious, cynical formula",1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,4591,"['Ides', 'March',

1508437,AP3B615GM191G,B0060ZJ7AI,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[3, 4]","Some politically-inclined films focus on the individual politicians themselves.  Others deal more with the issues embedded within the rhetoric.  ""The Ides of March"", however, takes a bit of a new approach to the genre by focusing almost solely on the machinations taking place ""behind the scenes"" of a political campaign for office.For a basic plot summary, ""Ides"" deals primarily with Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling), who is working on the campaign of presidential-hopeful Mike Morris (George Clooney).  With the campaign seemingly headed in the right direction, Myers suddenly finds himself involved with a girl (Evan Rachel Wood), at odds with his boss (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and even being recruited by the opposing candidate's top campaign man (Paul Giamatti).  Much emotion and many moral quandaries ensue.The hallmark of this film is that it is always one step ahead of the viewer.  You might think you know what the plot and characters are heading towards, but it never quite turns out that way.  I can't even categorize this film style as ""twists & turns"", but rather just out-thinking the audience.  ""Ides"" seems to know exactly what you will be thinking, and then challenges that notion.The pacing is very good as well.  Never, while viewing, did I feel bored or want things to ""pick up"".  ""Ides"" did a remarkable job of telling a story not especially inherent with action, yet making it an explosive film nonetheless.  Director Clooney likely deserves a good share of the credit for this.Of course, it only helps that the cast is star-studded, to say the least.  Gosling keeps proving (time and again in 2011!) that he is every bit a leading man, while Clooney and the rest are all at their best.  Each cast member adds a little something different to the overall puzzle.Overall, I consider ""The Ides of March"" to be a great political film.  Admittedly, I am a sucker for such cinema, but about the only negative thing I can say about the experience was that I wished it were longer...the film ends so abruptly that you really never see it coming!  Other than that, though, this movie will keep you engaged and make you think about its topics.",4,A Campaign Exposed,1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,2155,"['politically-inclined', 'films', 'focus', 'individual', 'politicians', 'Others', 'deal', 'more', 'issues', 'embedded', 'rhetoric', 'Ides', 'March', 'however', 'bit', 'new', 'approach', 'genre', 'focusing', 'almost', 'solely', 'machinations', 'taking', 'place', 'scenes', 'political', 'campaign', 'office.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Ides', 'deals', 'primarily', 'Stephen', 'Myers', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'who', 'working', 'campaign', 'presidential-hopeful', 'Mike', 'Morris', 'George', 'Clooney', 'campaign', 'seemingly', 'headed', 'right', 'direction', 'Myers', 'suddenly', 'involved', 'girl', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'odds', 'boss', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'even', 'being', 'recruited', 'opposing', 'candidate', 'top', 'campaign', 'man', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Much', 'emotion', 'many', 'moral', 'quandaries', 'ensue.The', 'hallmark', 'film', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'viewer', 'might', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'heading', 'towards', 'never', 'quite', 'out', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'categorize', 'film', 'style', 'twists', 'turns', 'rather', 'just', 'out-thinking', 'audience', 'Ides', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'thinking', 'then', 'notion.The', 'pacing', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'Never', 'viewing', 'did', 'feel', 'bored', 'want', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'Ides', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'not', 'especially', 'inherent', 'action', 'yet', 'making', 'explosive', 'film', 'nonetheless', 'Director', 'Clooney', 'likely', 'good', 'share', 'credit', 'this.Of', 'course', 'only', 'cast', 'star-studded', 'say', 'least', 'Gosling', 'keeps', 'proving', 'time', 'again', '2011', 'bit', 'leading', 'man', 'Clooney', 'rest', 'are', 'best', 'cast', 'member', 'little', 'something', 'different', 'overall', 'puzzle.Overall', 'consider', 'Ides', 'March', 'be', 'great', 'political', 'film', 'Admittedly', 'am', 'sucker', 'such', 'cinema', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'experience', 'was', 'wished', 'were', 'longer', 'film', 'so', 'abruptly', 'really', 'never', 'see', 'coming', 'Other', 'though', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'engaged', 'make', 'think', 'topics']",N/A

However, ""The Ides of March"" shows us just how difficult a campaign can be. Whether you consider yourself Conservative, Liberal or Independent, you can enjoy this film, for I don't believe Clooney's intent was to make a political statement.For a general plot description, the film is about the campaigns of candidates Mike Morris (Clooney) and Arkansas Senator Ted Pullman. Both candidates are going for the Democratic nomination in the presidential election. Morris's campaign is managed by Stephen Meyers (Gosling) and Manager Paul Zara (Seymour Hoffman) while Pullman's campaign is managed by Tom Duffy (Giamatti). Both candidates are trying to get the endorsement of North Carolina Democratic Senator Franklin Thompson, who controls 356 delegates. Whoever gets his endorsement will have enough delegates to take the nomination.What truly makes this film great is the realism that Clooney puts in it. Everything that happens during the campaign could happen and probably has happened in real-life. Anyone who enjoys political dramas or is just interested in the political campaign process should enjoy this film.",4,A Great Political Campaign Drama,1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,1223,"['surface', 'working', 'political', 'campaign', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'not', 'most', 'difficult', 'job', 'world', 'However', 'Ides', 'March', 'just', 'how', 'difficult', 'campaign', 'can', 'be', 'consider', 'Conservative', 'Liberal', 'Independent', 'can', 'enjoy', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Clooney', 'intent', 'was', 'make', 'political', 'statement.For', 'general', 'plot', 'description', 'film', 'campaigns', 'candidates', 'Mike', 'Morris', 'Clooney', 'Arkansas', 'Senator', 'Ted', 'Pullman', 'candidates', 'are', 'going', 'Democratic', 'nomination', 'presidential', 'election', 'Morris', 'campaign', 'managed', 'Stephen', 'Meyers', 'Gosling', 'Manager', 'Paul', 'Zara', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Pullman', 'campaign', 'managed', 'Tom', 'Duffy', 'Giamatti', 'candidates', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'endorsement', 'North', 'Carolina', 'Democratic', 'Senator', 'Franklin', 'Thompson', 'who', '356', 'delegates', 'Whoever', 'endorsement', 'will', 'have', 'enough', 'delegates', 'take', 'truly', 'film', 'great', 'realism', 'Clooney', 'Everything', 'campaign', 'could', 'happen', 'probably', 'happened', 'real-life', 'Anyone', 'who', 'political', 'dramas', 'just', 'interested', 'political', 'campaign', 'process', 'should', 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A
