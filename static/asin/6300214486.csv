This is what I had always seen on on cable movie channels, so I didn't miss a thing! Very sexy story that will give any ""desperate housewife"" something to fantasize about. Steve Bauer portrayed his character very convincingly as a love struck bad boy thief who burglarizes a young couple's home and falls obsessively in love with his female victim played by Barbara Williams. She's in a ho-hum marriage and ends up having an affair with the thief unknowing that he's the one that robbed her home. The whole cast (with a quasi performance by George Wendt) was well cast, and the storyline flowed very smoothly. The music, designs, and wardrobe are so 80's and that really is a blast from the past. Its a shame Steve Bauer's career didn't quite get out of the stereotype of Manolo from Scarface, but this sure is one of his most memorable performances following up to that movie.",5,Very sexy story....,1209513600,"04 30, 2008",2008,947,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'fuss', 'edition', 'missing', 'scenes', 'what', 'had', 'always', 'seen', 'cable', 'movie', 'channels', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'thing', 'Very', 'sexy', 'story', 'will', 'give', 'desperate', 'housewife', 'something', 'fantasize', 'Steve', 'Bauer', 'portrayed', 'character', 'very', 'convincingly', 'love', 'struck', 'bad', 'boy', 'thief', 'who', 'young', 'couple', 'home', 'obsessively', 'love', 'female', 'victim', 'played', 'Barbara', 'Williams', 'ho-hum', 'marriage', 'up', 'having', 'affair', 'thief', 'unknowing', 'one', 'robbed', 'home', 'whole', 'cast', 'quasi', 'performance', 'George', 'Wendt', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'storyline', 'flowed', 'very', 'smoothly', 'music', 'designs', 'wardrobe', 'are', 'so', '80', 'really', 'blast', 'past', 'shame', 'Steve', 'Bauer', 'career', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'stereotype', 'Manolo', 'Scarface', 'sure', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'following', 'up', 'movie']",N/A

213039,A1IWR4FKPGE95C,6300214486,Carlos Rodriguez,"[6, 7]","I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in 1984. I thought it was a good film and really enjoyed it. The music in this movie is really good and it adds a certain sexy appeal to the film's love scenes. I found this movie to be highly erotic which I love and thought the lovemaking scene in the thief's bedroom was done in very good taste without being too ponographic. As far as the acting is concern, Steven Bauer was very convincing as the man who disruptured Mickey's somewhat perfect marriage after stealing her diaries. As for Barbara Williams, no big deal I think she really needs to relax more in front of the camera she looked tense in most scenes. She really would benefit from enrolling in a good drama school and really learning her craft. David Caruso formerly on NYPD BLUE and now on CSI MIAMI, is also quite good as the volatile Bobby Calamara. I gave this movie three stars because I believe the movie could have told more about Scott's personal life and find out more about his background. He was extremely private and the audience I feel felt they were missing a great deal to his way of thinking and why he did what he did for a living. He was a loner, perhaps too much of a loner. Still this was a good movie I'm glad that they finally released it on DVD I wish they would release the soundtrack on CD, I love the music in this movie it is extremely romantic and erotic. Overall, what made this movie appealing to me was no doubt Steven Bauer's performance. He is a great actor is just too bad that we haven't seen too much of him especially in really good movies. Most of the movies that he has done have gone straight to video and they're pretty dissapointing the majority of them. It would be a good thing if he was offered a starring role in a major motion picture that would really show what he is capable of as an actor. Like I said he is a great actor who has not really been the kind of opportunities that actors like Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt have had. Buy this movie is really good and very sexy.

However, this is sort of an enigmatic film. As much as it is part of the 80s it seemed to lack the chic timeliness of those days. I don't know why but David Caruso was the one actor who I remember being indelibly connected to it. Every time I think of this film all I can remember is Caruso's screen presence even though he is a minor yet disquieting character. Steven Bauer is very good and gives a heartfelt performance. Barbara Williams seemed rather detached and added to the obscure feeling this film has along with John Getz's performance as well. Bauer, Williams and Getz remain no more than shadowy figures upon recollection, while the production design, cinematography and story remain imbedded in the psyche. The story is interesting and disturbing at the same time and I wonder who really is the thief of hearts in this tale giving the film's ultimate conclusion. I think Douglas Day Stewart's directed only one other motion picture and he is primarily a screenwriter. The film's ambiguous style seems to bolsters that fact. The film is a very provocative mix of sensuality, sexual repression and seems to represents an era when introverted self gratification and glossy lifestyles replace traditional intimate values between otherwise loved ones.

How I was aloud to watch it at such a young age I'll never know but I'm glad I was. This is one of those films that some how got lost in the cracks and should be more appreciated than it is. I have always thought that Steven Bauer was one of the great under rated actors out there. He has many different ranges as an actor and was never given the proper appreciation. From his loyal,best friend,hardcore Cuban in Scarface to his thief with the heart of gold here, he shows just a peek of his range as a great actor. In my book this is a must own for any movie lover,collector,and just any fan of romantic love triangles. While I saw this film when I was about nine or ten,I would have to say that this one is not for the youngsters. That being said I would recommend movie fans see this one as soon as possible. On a side note while I have done nothing but speak of Bauer there some other great performances in this film such as a young up and comer named David Caruso from C.S.I. Miami fame.

213047,A2YQSGJO83II19,6300214486,Peter Gordon,"[0, 0]","Good mystery-suspense thriller, however, there was one problem with the script that bothered me. Barbara Williams character (Mickey Davis) was missing her secret, forbidden diaries because of a burglary, then all of a sudden a dark, handsome man comes along and happens to show up coincidentally in public here and there in Mickey's life. They start to have an affair and all of a sudden, she notices her lover knows very peculiar things about her. You would think that this dizzy, suburban, sexually frustrated yuppie could put two and two together at that point in the film. Meaning, ""gee, could it be this man broke into my house a month ago and stole my diaries, that is how he knows everything about me, and now he is seducing me, so I can play out my deepest, darkest fantasies?"" Give me a break. Other than that, I loved the score, bought it on Amazon seven years ago, brand new on CD. I was stalking it for 10 years and finally purchased it for $92.00. Harold Faltermeyer is solid as usual, and it really affected the film. Barbara Williams is gorgeous, and I fell in love with her back in 1984. My favorite movie is ""Scarface"" and I loved Steven Bauer in that. A year later he did ""Thief of Hearts"" and turns into the dark, masterful stud. His performance was convincing, thus, something bothered me about his presence in that film. At times, he is borderline cheesy, with a pretty boy cheesy smile, instead of portraying the suave, masculine rugged burglar I was hoping he would be. He is quite the ladies man, I can totally see, however, he might have some issues on the man's side of the ball. Christopher Sarandon in ""Fright Night"" delivered a masterful performance, for example, and was hardly cheesy. Or Mickey Rourke in ""Wild Orchid"" with his 16 inches of applied suntan lotion. Those were the great studs back in the day. As for the rest of the cast, John Getz was perfect as the betrayed, impotent husband, and George Wendt provided needed comic relief. Good movie, not great, more of a chick-flick. If every married, horny bored woman has a ""thief of hearts"" somewhere in their life, one time or another, that's great, just don't tell your husband.
