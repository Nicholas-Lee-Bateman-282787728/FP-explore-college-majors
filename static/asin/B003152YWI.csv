Unfortunately, the movie lost money at the box office which goes to show again that there is no justice in this world.It's hard to classify this film: comedy? drama? science-fiction? all of the above? Paul Giamatti stars himself as an actor who is having emotional problems in portraying a character in ""Uncle Vanya,"" although it's right on target. His agent suggests going through a procedure which has become commonplace, that of removing his soul (which then takes physical shape) and having it temporarily stored. Well, the pain, the angst, the existential whachamacallit is gone, but he is not the same person anymore and his performance actually gets worse. So he wants it back. In the meantime, his life is intersected by a Russian woman who is a ""mule"" for smuggling Russian souls for rent/sale into the US (why they are in demand is left unexplained).The films has a few dead spots here and there, nothing serious, but it diminishes the pace of the movie.Excellent supporting performance by David Strathairn, an actor we do not get enough chances to see.",4,An original plot,1312416000,"08 4, 2011",2011,1099,"['highly', 'unusual', 'original', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'lost', 'money', 'box', 'office', 'show', 'again', 'justice', 'world.It', 'hard', 'classify', 'film', 'comedy', 'drama', 'science-fiction', 'above', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'actor', 'who', 'having', 'emotional', 'problems', 'portraying', 'character', 'Uncle', 'Vanya', 'right', 'target', 'agent', 'going', 'procedure', 'become', 'commonplace', 'removing', 'soul', 'then', 'physical', 'shape', 'having', 'temporarily', 'stored', 'Well', 'pain', 'angst', 'existential', 'whachamacallit', 'gone', 'not', 'same', 'person', 'anymore', 'performance', 'actually', 'worse', 'back', 'meantime', 'life', 'intersected', 'Russian', 'woman', 'who', 'mule', 'smuggling', 'Russian', 'souls', 'rent/sale', 'US', 'why', 'are', 'demand', 'left', 'unexplained', '.The', 'films', 'few', 'dead', 'spots', 'here', 'there', 'nothing', 'serious', 'pace', 'movie.Excellent', 'supporting', 'performance', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'actor', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'chances', 'see']",Cold Souls

He can't quite figure out what's not right, but his agent thinks he has the answer - store your soul for awhile.  Much like the memory erasing process in Eternal Sunshine, you're not really erasing who you are.  Not totally.  Just getting rid of some extra baggage.  There may be some side effects as every soul is different who knows what those will be?This is NOT a movie for everyone.  It's not really a comedy, not a drama, not an action flick.  It just sort of is.  The cover of of the DVD does paint it as the kind of comedy that will pretty much have you on the floor rolling.  That's not what this is.  Luckily I had an idea of what it was before I bought it and knew it was my kind of movie.  Instead of what the cover depicts it as, it's actually one of those movies that has you questioning the impossible.  Would you store your soul if the option did exist?  It has you wondering will Paul get his soul back?  At one point  you start to wonder, should he even try to get it back?  Etc.  I don't want to go too far beyond that for fear I'd give  away too much.I'm giving it 5 stars because it's totally my kind of movie.

Also, as a fan of Mr. Giamatti's work, it was interesting to see allusions to his other films (the white room sequence recalled something similar in ""Amercian Splendor"").In terms of the DVD, there are few extra features.  Deleted scenes, a 5-minute short on the fabrication of the Soul Extractor, and trailers for other films.  The absence of a commentary is a disappointment.

Paul Giamatti plays a beleaguered NYC theater actor (named Paul Giamatti) who is having a hard time dealing with the psychological anxiety of playing the lead in Checkhov's seminal Uncle Vanya, so he enlists the help of a team of Soul-storers led by the excellent (yet dry) David Stratham. They remove his soul under the guise of making his life better, and for a while, it seems to work. Gradually, he realizes tht soullessness is no fun, as a soul makes you human. (there is also a vague subplot concerning the Russian mob and similarly murky dream sequences involving old greying corpse-like men and small children that play like watered-down David Lynch) The film progresses like a slower version of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, without the love-story angle or exciting visuals...and really, come to think about it, without the interesting characters involved in the whole scheme of muddling with intangibility (Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst equalled out Jim Carrey's sadness in that film, here there is no comic relief...just more mopey, flat characters like the Russian girl)  There is a pretty drab blue, smoky color palate at work here, and a lot of talented character actors doing their cold, straight-man routines. There are a lot of scenes of Giamatti just staring off at things in a faux-existential stupor. This tactic, while it reinforces his soulless ennui, is painfully slow. Occasional humor permeates the cloud of despondence, as when Paul admits to his wife that he has been turned into a empty, staggering vessel, or when (soulless) his Uncle Vanya takes on a brash, kooky aspect. Otherwise the film is morose, yet admirably well-lit.

And because the picture on the cover reminded me of his character in one of my favorite movies - Sideways. But that's where the similarities between these two movies end.I was disappointed with this movie for many reasons. First, the DVD cover has raves from some movie reviewers claiming how side-splittingly funny this flick is. Huh? I can't remember laughing once, let alone snickering. Ironically, I found the funniest moment in one of the deleted scenes (the one where Giamatti is rehearsing a scene and is told to act it like the wind). This is not a comedy. Not even a black comedy - which I would have welcomed.Second, though Giamatti's character looks like it was pulled directly from Sideways (complete with the bad brown corduroy blazer), that's where the similarities end. He appeared uncomfortable and self-conscious in his scenes and didn't seem to believe in the premise of the movie or the dialog.Third, well, the movie is just flat. You immediately are reminded by the premise of Being John Malkovich. But Malkovich somehow made you accept its incredible premise; Cold Souls did not. And if you don't buy into the gimmicky basis of the plot, then you are going to have a tough time taking the rest of the movie seriously.The movie left me feeling so gypped that I scoured the bonus features for something to enjoy. The deleted scenes were ok but the documentary on the design of the soul removal machine was ridiculous. The guys who designed it went on and on about their artistic influences for its look. Like they just created the Pieta. Wha? The thing looked like the love child of an MRI machine and the Michelin man. There was nothing impressive about its appearance. The designers should start looking for work in a different field.Very disappointed.

Sadly, this movie didn't live up to its billing.  Admittedly there were a few parts of the story (mostly toward the beginning) that had us laughing out loud, but they were too few and far between to justify the claims on the label.  The longer the story went on, the less funny it became, and most of the second half barely got a chuckle out of us.While the premise of the story was novel and certainly held out some promise for a solid comedy, most of the movie was just plain dark, depressing and surreal.  Much of it is set in Russia, which is depressing enough by itself.  The themes are dark.  The suicide of a marginal character is dark.  The use of lighting is, well, dark.  Yes, there are some places where it works and evokes some laughs, but the rest of the movie just doesn't work -- unless you have an extremely dry, somewhat twisted sense of humor.

I've watched it three times already, having rented it from a video outlet.In any event, anyone who admires the precision and intensely sharp work of Paul Giamatti should find this a great primer on acting. As the film shows, when ""actor Paul Giamatti"" suffers from the burdensome weight of rehearsing Chekhov's *Uncle Vanya* he enlists the services of an entrepreneurial operation which puts souls in cold storage.  The result of a ""soulless actor"" is hilarious (though in interviews Giamatti swears he's not channeling William Shatner's much-parodied histrionics).As always, Giamatti's performance is Academy Award material, casting nuances and fascinating acting choices at every turn. Ably coupled with Emily Watson and a fine supporting cast, this film, in my mind, suffers only in a couple areas--much of the film is visually dark, heavily shadowed on the DVD, and people who approach it thinking (rightfully so) that it's a bang-up comedy might find it slow going.But I would submit the pacing is just right for this material: Soul extraction is not just played for laughs, though there are many to be enjoyed [The film is a scathing satire of the free market gone horribly wrong; see the novel *Jennifer Government* by Maxx Barry for a more free-wheeling examination of this idea]. This is a poignant Ecce-Homo-meets-Memento-Mori film whose ending begs for discussion.Knowing it was partially filmed in Russia heightened my enjoyment of the film and added an extra dimension to the drab existential ""aloneness"" that one of the key players exhibited.  And knowing Boris Leskin knows no English added powerful verisimilitude to the production.  Though the film (again, quite rightly) is being compared to Charlie Kaufman's work, for me *Cold Souls* offered much more heart and hope than any of CK's work, which usually leaves me entertained but cold-souled.Despite its rather measured pacing, somewhat dark transfer, and the soul extractor's appearance (to me) as an oversized roll of Cottonelle, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone who wants to think a bit while enjoying a few great performances.",4,Souls Preserve Us!,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,2211,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'wonder', 'why', 'Amazon', 'slated', 'March', 'release', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'three', 'times', 'already', 'having', 'rented', 'video', 'event', 'anyone', 'who', 'precision', 'intensely', 'sharp', 'work', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'should', 'find', 'great', 'primer', 'acting', 'film', 'shows', 'when', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'suffers', 'burdensome', 'weight', 'rehearsing', 'Chekhov', '*Uncle', 'Vanya*', 'services', 'entrepreneurial', 'operation', 'souls', 'cold', 'storage', 'result', 'soulless', 'actor', 'hilarious', 'interviews', 'Giamatti', 'not', 'channeling', 'William', 'Shatner', 'much-parodied', 'histrionics', '.As', 'always', 'Giamatti', 'performance', 'Academy', 'Award', 'material', 'casting', 'nuances', 'fascinating', 'acting', 'choices', 'turn', 'Ably', 'coupled', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'mind', 'suffers', 'only', 'couple', 'areas', 'much', 'film', 'visually', 'dark', 'heavily', 'shadowed', 'DVD', 'people', 'who', 'approach', 'thinking', 'rightfully', 'so', 'bang-up', 'comedy', 'might', 'find', 'slow', 'going.But', 'would', 'submit', 'pacing', 'just', 'right', 'material', 'Soul', 'extraction', 'not', 'just', 'played', 'laughs', 'are', 'many', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'scathing', 'satire', 'free', 'market', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'see', 'novel', '*Jennifer', 'Government*', 'Maxx', 'Barry', 'more', 'free-wheeling', 'examination', 'idea', ']', 'poignant', 'Ecce-Homo-meets-Memento-Mori', 'film', 'ending', 'begs', 'discussion.Knowing', 'was', 'partially', 'filmed', 'Russia', 'heightened', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'added', 'extra', 'dimension', 'drab', 'existential', 'aloneness', 'one', 'key', 'players', 'exhibited', 'knowing', 'Boris', 'Leskin', 'English', 'added', 'powerful', 'verisimilitude', 'production', 'film', 'again', 'quite', 'rightly', 'being', 'compared', 'Charlie', 'Kaufman', 'work', '*Cold', 'Souls*', 'offered', 'much', 'more', 'heart', 'hope', 'CK', 'work', 'usually', 'entertained', 'cold-souled.Despite', 'rather', 'measured', 'pacing', 'somewhat', 'dark', 'transfer', 'soul', 'extractor', 'appearance', 'oversized', 'roll', 'Cottonelle', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'think', 'bit', 'enjoying', 'few', 'great', 'performances']",Cold Souls

His acting improves, but his wife finds him different, he sees bits of the borrowed soul's life, and he's now deep in sorrow. He wants his own soul back, but there are complications: it's in St. Petersburg. With the help of Nina, a Russian who transports souls to the U.S., he determines to get it back.

1316700,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003152YWI,Turfseer,"[7, 12]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Cold Souls' is another film that defies easy classification. I think it's best to think of it as more of a combination of fantasy and satire than science fiction, since it doesn't take itself at all very seriously. It seems to be set in present day New York, but it could be a few years in the future. Paul Giamatti plays a depressed version of himself who feels he's lost his creative abilities as an actor. While rehearsing the part of Uncle Vanya in the famed Chekov play, he finds he simply cannot bring the character to life.While flipping through The New Yorker magazine, he sees an ad for an outfit that specializes in 'Soul Storage' located (in of all places), Roosevelt Island! He makes an appointment and goes to the see the director of the company, Dr. Flintstein (David Strathaim). Flintstein explains that what his company does is extract souls from peoples' bodies and stores them for a fee. The actual extraction does not affect the consciousness of the person and they retain all their memories. Flinstein further explains to Giamatti that 5% of the soul usually survives the extraction procedure but without the other 95%, supposedly the personality will become 'lighter' and less unencumbered since most of the soul is no longer there to weigh the person down.Giamatti agrees to the procedure and enters a contraption that looks like a modern day 'iron lung'. The actual soul resembles a chickpea and is stored in a container which is then placed in locked drawers inside a room that resembles a bank vault. The company also specializes in renting out other peoples' souls which are smuggled in by black market mules from Russia. When Giamatti's soul is first extracted, he feels the initial procedure doesn't help him with his acting skills so he rents the soul of an anonymous Russian poet which he hopes will make him more proficient in playing Uncle Vanya.While Giamatti's wife perceives him to be a different person, there is no outwardly discernible change in his personality. Even though Giamatti's body is inhabited by the soul of a poet, we the audience cannot perceive the change. Thus the potential for any kind of interesting plot twists or satire is lost.The plot takes a turn when the head of the black market soul extraction operation in Russia orders one of the mules, Nina (Nina Korzun), to steal the soul of a famous American actor for his wife, who wants to improve her acting skills in soap operas. The joke is that the only 'famous actor' they have on file is Giamatti, so Nina steals his soul and it's placed in the actress's body. Giamatti discovers that his soul is missing from the vault and eventually learns from Nina that it's the Russians who have pilfered it. The climax takes place mainly in Russia where Giamatti aided by Nina kidnap the actress and manage to retrieve the missing soul. Along the way, Giamatti discovers the identity of the Russian poet inside his body and it turns out she's committed suicide. The final scene has Giamatti meeting a woman at a beach--is it Nina or the dead poet? Whatever the case, the shot fades to a blur and the two figures seem to merge into one.The problem with Giamatti's attempt to make fun of himself is that it goes on ad infinitum. We GET the idea from the very beginning that he's supposed to be mediocre and narcissistic and half way through the movie, the mugging becomes tiresome. The same goes for the Russians--again the point is played out over and over again that they're a bunch of seedy, amoral characters who are just out to make a buck. The only really enjoyable character is the personable Dr. Flintstein-- David Strathaim does a fine job in conveying the humor of a man who treats the extraction and storage of souls as if he were selling life insurance.'Cold Souls' is often slow-paced, due to the repetitious scenes that feature the various characters undergoing the extraction process. Toward the film's climax, Giamatti puts on special goggle glasses and ""peers into his soul""--there are a few tame flashbacks of his childhood, but nothing very memorable.In the end, 'Cold Souls' has no real targets of value to satirize. The whole idea of 'soul extraction' is also too ludicrous for fantasy which requires some grounding in reality (an actual 'twister' carried Dorothy to the fantasy land of Oz; here, they're extracting souls that look like chickpeas). Some may still find 'Cold Souls' charming in an odd way but if you really look at it, this is a film based on a one-note, one-joke idea.",2,Giamatti attempts to make fun of himself in this one-note fantasy-satire misfire,1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,4545,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'Cold"", 'Souls', 'film', 'easy', 'classification', 'think', 'best', 'think', 'more', 'combination', 'fantasy', 'satire', 'science', 'fiction', ""n't"", 'take', 'very', 'seriously', 'be', 'set', 'present', 'day', 'New', 'York', 'could', 'be', 'few', 'years', 'future', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'depressed', 'version', 'who', 'lost', 'creative', 'abilities', 'actor', 'rehearsing', 'part', 'Uncle', 'Vanya', 'famed', 'Chekov', 'play', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'character', 'life.While', 'flipping', 'New', 'Yorker', 'magazine', 'ad', 'outfit', ""'Soul"", 'Storage', 'located', 'places', 'Roosevelt', 'Island', 'appointment', 'see', 'director', 'company', 'Dr.', 'Flintstein', 'David', 'Strathaim', 'Flintstein', 'what', 'company', 'extract', 'souls', 'peoples', 'bodies', 'stores', 'fee', 'actual', 'extraction', 'not', 'affect', 'consciousness', 'person', 'retain', 'memories', 'Flinstein', 'further', 'explains', 'Giamatti', '5', '%', 'soul', 'usually', 'extraction', 'procedure', 'other', '95', '%', 'supposedly', 'personality', 'will', 'become', ""'lighter"", 'less', 'unencumbered', 'most', 'soul', 'no', 'longer', 'there', 'weigh', 'person', 'down.Giamatti', 'procedure', 'contraption', 'modern', 'day', ""'iron"", 'lung', 'actual', 'soul', 'chickpea', 'stored', 'container', 'then', 'placed', 'locked', 'drawers', 'room', 'bank', 'vault', 'company', 'also', 'renting', 'out', 'other', 'peoples', 'souls', 'are', 'smuggled', 'black', 'market', 'mules', 'Russia', 'When', 'Giamatti', 'soul', 'first', 'extracted', 'initial', 'procedure', ""n't"", 'help', 'acting', 'skills', 'so', 'soul', 'anonymous', 'Russian', 'poet', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'proficient', 'playing', 'Uncle', 'Vanya.While', 'Giamatti', 'wife', 'be', 'different', 'person', 'outwardly', 'discernible', 'change', 'personality', 'Even', 'Giamatti', 'body', 'inhabited', 'soul', 'poet', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'perceive', 'change', 'Thus', 'potential', 'kind', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twists', 'satire', 'lost.The', 'plot', 'turn', 'when', 'head', 'black', 'market', 'soul', 'extraction', 'operation', 'Russia', 'orders', 'one', 'mules', 'Nina', 'Nina', 'Korzun', 'steal', 'soul', 'famous', 'American', 'actor', 'wife', 'who', 'improve', 'acting', 'skills', 'soap', 'operas', 'joke', 'only', ""'famous"", 'actor', 'have', 'file', 'Giamatti', 'so', 'Nina', 'steals', 'soul', 'placed', 'actress', 'body', 'Giamatti', 'soul', 'missing', 'vault', 'eventually', 'Nina', 'Russians', 'who', 'have', 'pilfered', 'climax', 'place', 'mainly', 'Russia', 'where', 'Giamatti', 'aided', 'Nina', 'kidnap', 'actress', 'manage', 'retrieve', 'missing', 'soul', 'way', 'Giamatti', 'identity', 'Russian', 'poet', 'body', 'out', 'committed', 'suicide', 'final', 'scene', 'Giamatti', 'meeting', 'woman', 'beach', 'Nina', 'dead', 'poet', 'case', 'shot', 'blur', 'two', 'figures', 'seem', 'merge', 'one.The', 'problem', 'Giamatti', 'attempt', 'make', 'fun', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'GET', 'idea', 'very', 'beginning', 'supposed', 'be', 'mediocre', 'narcissistic', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'mugging', 'tiresome', 'same', 'Russians', 'again', 'point', 'played', 'out', 'over', 'again', ""'re"", 'bunch', 'seedy', 'amoral', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'make', 'buck', 'only', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'character', 'personable', 'Dr.', 'Flintstein', 'David', 'Strathaim', 'fine', 'job', 'conveying', 'humor', 'man', 'who', 'extraction', 'storage', 'souls', 'were', 'selling', 'life', 'insurance', 'Souls', 'often', 'slow-paced', 'due', 'repetitious', 'scenes', 'feature', 'various', 'characters', 'undergoing', 'extraction', 'process', 'film', 'climax', 'Giamatti', 'special', 'goggle', 'glasses', 'peers', 'soul', 'are', 'few', 'tame', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'nothing', 'very', 'memorable.In', 'end', 'Souls', 'real', 'targets', 'value', 'satirize', 'whole', 'idea', ""'soul"", 'extraction', 'also', 'too', 'ludicrous', 'fantasy', 'grounding', 'reality', 'actual', ""'twister"", 'carried', 'Dorothy', 'fantasy', 'land', 'Oz', 'here', ""'re"", 'extracting', 'souls', 'look', 'chickpeas', 'may', 'still', 'find', ""'Cold"", 'Souls', 'charming', 'odd', 'way', 'really', 'look', 'film', 'based', 'one-note', 'one-joke', 'idea']",Cold Souls
