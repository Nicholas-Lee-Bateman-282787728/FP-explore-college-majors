The Learning Channel had just been added to the cable line-up.  It was late and I was bored, so I started watching this new channel.  They featured this show called Connections with James Burk.  I'd never had any passing interest in history or how it was made up and I totally expected this show to bore me and I could make fun of it.  I even readied myself to make fun of it.The problem was the show totally captivated me.  James Burk's ideas and presentation showed me a history I'd never seen before.  It was a history that was captivating and energetic.  James shows a history that's not full of blood and death, but of exploration and hope.  He shows how wonder and excitement had driven some people to produce the most modern wonders.It's easy to think that we've achieved everything we can, until you see this series.  This series clearly has a great feeling for how to move forward based on where we were.  I suggest the first three seasons of this series, but I tell people to NOT miss the first season.On the flip-side, given every good thing I ever said about this series, my wife of 23+ years fell asleep less than 10 minutes into the first episode.

Indeed, when you start into the series you notice the age of the film.  Shot a couple of decades ago the film and the narration show their age.

Burke does an excellent job making this series of successive inventions interesting and fun to follow.  I found myself enjoying the science and history lesson found in each of the episodes.

The narrator shows the role of geometry and math in general in building civilization and shows how important technology was in warfare.  By comparing civilizations, Burke describes the importance of the profit motive and incentives in achievement and invention.Even though this series originally appeared on the BBC in 1978, and many important inventions have come about since then, this series holds up well.

I watched these quite some time ago as a young lad and now use these in my research classes, ESL situations, to help students think about how to make connections. Despite the dated scenes the content is brilliant and kind of a social time capsule (smoking on airplanes, 70's hair styles, sedans running the streets of Manhattan).I think that if you like to think about technology this is seriously a wonderful series.

James Burke takes us on a trip of a series of seemingly unrelated events, to where it results in something that changes everything, thereby affecting all our lives. We have become so dependent on our technology, so what happens when it fails? We recorded Connections 1 back in 1978 on VHS so we have watch this program over the years before buying it on DVD. In the opening scene of &#34;The Trigger Effect&#34; one will see the World Trade Center at the ground level and on its roof top. As this story unfolds there is a plane on final approach to the JFK airport. Then there is a massive technology failure causing this plane to head right for the downtown Manhattan skyscrapers. Its flight number is 911. Remember this is 1978 not 2001. Everyone who has ever visited our home and saw this opening scene ends up watching the entire 10 episodes.

I was getting these on 16mm from my State Library system up until they stopped offering them at a reasonable price. They started charging $10 per episode and I couldn't afford them any longer. Soon after the whole Pennsylvania State Film Collection disappeared. But,... up until then I was watching these fantastic programs on a giant screen in my living room. The images were nothing less than Stunning through out the entire series I thought and seemed to be Shot in the older style of Big Screen Movies, rather than National Geographic's bow to TV and using way too many super closeups. Now that many of us are acquiring larger screen TV's and even theatre size Video Projection in our homes, I should think a series like this will turn out to be a revelation. I can't wait to get my copy of this and his other Masterpiece The Day The Universe Changed. Here, Here for the BBC and their wonderful film Photographers!!!! The bigger the screen, the more amazing this series is.Update...Ah well... I got a couple episodes to check from the first series from my local library and to my great disappointment they looked pretty terrible. The original film was full of dirt and it's a fuzzy low res transfer and just not what it can be. Certainly James monologue is still compelling. But at least the first season did not have that great photography I remembered. It's fast and quick TV shooting. Even that would still be OK if the transfers were better. Maybe I was looking at The Day the Universe Changed? Or perhaps one of the later entries, but these first DVD's from Ambrose looked pretty bad to me. I hope the other sets are better or they get the money some day to give them the restoration treatment they deserve.",5,BBC Photography not terrific?,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,1832,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'one', 'would', 'knock', 'photography', 'series', 'James', 'Burke', 'Connections', 'see', 'have', 'was', 'getting', '16mm', 'State', 'Library', 'system', 'up', 'stopped', 'offering', 'reasonable', 'price', 'started', 'charging', '10', 'episode', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'longer', 'Soon', 'whole', 'Pennsylvania', 'State', 'Film', 'Collection', 'disappeared', 'up', 'then', 'was', 'watching', 'fantastic', 'programs', 'giant', 'screen', 'living', 'room', 'images', 'were', 'nothing', 'less', 'Stunning', 'entire', 'series', 'thought', 'seemed', 'be', 'Shot', 'older', 'style', 'Big', 'Screen', 'Movies', 'rather', 'National', 'Geographic', 'bow', 'TV', 'using', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'super', 'closeups', 'Now', 'many', 'are', 'acquiring', 'larger', 'screen', 'TV', 'even', 'theatre', 'size', 'Video', 'Projection', 'homes', 'should', 'think', 'series', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'revelation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'copy', 'other', 'Masterpiece', 'Day', 'Universe', 'Changed', 'Here', 'Here', 'BBC', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Photographers', 'bigger', 'screen', 'more', 'amazing', 'series', 'is.Update', 'Ah', 'well', 'got', 'couple', 'check', 'first', 'series', 'local', 'library', 'great', 'disappointment', 'looked', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'full', 'dirt', 'fuzzy', 'low', 'res', 'transfer', 'just', 'not', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'Certainly', 'James', 'monologue', 'still', 'compelling', 'least', 'first', 'season', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'great', 'photography', 'remembered', 'fast', 'quick', 'TV', 'shooting', 'Even', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'OK', 'transfers', 'were', 'better', 'Maybe', 'was', 'looking', 'Day', 'Universe', 'Changed', 'perhaps', 'one', 'later', 'entries', 'first', 'DVD', 'Ambrose', 'looked', 'pretty', 'bad', 'hope', 'other', 'sets', 'are', 'better', 'get', 'money', 'day', 'give', 'restoration', 'treatment', 'deserve']",Connections 1

I recently bought this (did I really pay $90?). I have to say that Burke still holds up and even surpasses most documentaries made since. Somehow, someway, he puts that reserved Brit enthusiasm right through the screen. Other than his modish style clothes, the series holds up very well.If you're thinking of getting it for grandma, be aware there is some brief nudity.Overall still a great series.
