This is how a drama film with a light touch of comedy *should* be created. Take notes all you aspiring film makers!It's about three soldiers that all happen to have their flight cancelled, so they end up driving in a vehicle together and eventually they become good friends. They go on the adventure of a lifetime as they travel across the country, meet several different people along the way, and get involved in many different life-changing experiences.What's amazing about the Lucky Ones is, without a doubt, the brilliant storytelling. This is seriously one of the most memorable and interesting stories I've seen in a movie in a REALLY long time. I totally enjoyed it from beginning to end. It's easy to follow, exciting, and just highly underrated when you realize how many other films have gotten more attention than this one has.The one soldier -the female- was REALLY funny. I was totally laughing hard at every singel sexual related joke she made towards the other soldier (that she gradually became good friends with). The oldest soldier of the bunch probably had the worst luck of the three considering all the stuff he finds out about his family when he returns home.  Luckily he has two friends that help get his life back together.The Lucky Ones also does a really good job showing what it's like going through life from a soldiers point of view.  You see scenes showing their wounds they suffered while fighting, and you see the occasional nightmare segments as well.  These are frequent problems involving soldiers who return home from war.  Good detail there.This is just a simple story about three soldiers who have the time of their lives while spending a lot of time together. The storyline is AMAZINGLY good, the acting skills are rock solid, and the overall film is highly recommended. The only negative is a certain tornado scene near the end. The tornado itself looks incredibly tacky, but other than that, I have nothing but really great things to say about the Lucky Ones.",5,what an underrated movie,1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,2085,"['am', 'honestly', 'REALLY', 'surprised', 'so', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'apparently', 'heard', 'Lucky', 'Ones', 'how', 'drama', 'film', 'light', 'touch', 'comedy', '*should*', 'be', 'created', 'Take', 'notes', 'aspiring', 'film', 'makers', 'three', 'soldiers', 'happen', 'have', 'flight', 'cancelled', 'end', 'up', 'driving', 'vehicle', 'together', 'eventually', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'go', 'adventure', 'lifetime', 'travel', 'country', 'meet', 'several', 'different', 'people', 'way', 'get', 'involved', 'many', 'different', 'life-changing', 'experiences.What', 'amazing', 'Lucky', 'Ones', 'doubt', 'brilliant', 'storytelling', 'seriously', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'interesting', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'REALLY', 'long', 'time', 'totally', 'enjoyed', 'beginning', 'end', 'easy', 'follow', 'exciting', 'just', 'highly', 'underrated', 'when', 'realize', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'attention', 'one', 'has.The', 'one', 'soldier', '-the', 'female-', 'was', 'REALLY', 'funny', 'was', 'totally', 'laughing', 'hard', 'singel', 'sexual', 'related', 'joke', 'made', 'towards', 'other', 'soldier', 'gradually', 'became', 'good', 'friends', 'oldest', 'soldier', 'bunch', 'probably', 'had', 'worst', 'luck', 'three', 'considering', 'stuff', 'out', 'family', 'when', 'home', 'Luckily', 'two', 'friends', 'help', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'together.The', 'Lucky', 'Ones', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'what', 'going', 'life', 'soldiers', 'point', 'view', 'see', 'scenes', 'showing', 'wounds', 'suffered', 'fighting', 'see', 'occasional', 'nightmare', 'segments', 'well', 'are', 'frequent', 'problems', 'involving', 'soldiers', 'who', 'return', 'home', 'war', 'Good', 'detail', 'there.This', 'just', 'simple', 'story', 'three', 'soldiers', 'who', 'have', 'time', 'lives', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'together', 'storyline', 'AMAZINGLY', 'good', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'rock', 'solid', 'overall', 'film', 'highly', 'recommended', 'only', 'negative', 'certain', 'tornado', 'scene', 'end', 'tornado', 'incredibly', 'tacky', 'other', 'have', 'nothing', 'really', 'great', 'things', 'say', 'Lucky', 'Ones']","Lucky Ones, The"

1208526,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B001KP2J2G,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","The previews looked good and I couldn't argue the cast so I figured to give this a shot. This isn't a bad movie by any means, but given everything, it should have been better.I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he's always had a knack for picking nifty, quirkyish kinds of projects, so I was surprised at how pedestrian this was. He does do a better than decent job with the material. I like Rachel McAdams enough but something in her performance here is pushing her to the next level. I'm now thinking she might be someone to keep an eye on. Michael Pena does an OK job. Not bad but not as outstanding as his co-cast members.This is essentially a road trip flick where our 3 heroes come back to the states from the Mid-East (2 are on a 30 day leave with Robbins having finished his tour) and get weather-stranded at the airport. They share the cost of a rental to Robbins' house from which Pena and McAdams will grab flights to their respective destinations. Things go south for Robbins in the form of family troubles and now the 3 will continue west where their bond deepens.The trouble here lies in the script. Their bonding commitment to each other happens way too quickly for my money. There isn't really anything that happens to show why they would treat each other like something other than casual acquaintances. Maybe there is something in the ""band of brothers"" sticktoitiveness I don't get but it simply didn't feel right to me. There were also some scenes that I found no place for. A particular scene involving a sudden desert rainstorm seemed to have little purpose other than to settle another aspect of the plot which could have been done in a much more organic fashion. And there seemed to be a need for the writer to resolve everyone's story, even if not in a conventional Hollywoodish type way. Life is messy and things don't always work out.What I did like was the natural look of things. This was shot to look only slightly better than a home movie which did give the sense of seeing something more real. The music score was decent enough as was the editing. There just seemed to be a forced quality to it all. I felt the writer's hand on virtually everything that went on.This is not a bad movie and I could easily nudge my review up another half star, but don't expect too much from it.

My wife and I love finding independent films that deserve more attention. With a stellar cast, we wanted to see where ""The Lucky Ones"" would take us.This isn't a perfect film, and it doesn't work on every level, but the three performances alone make it a joy to watch. All three play Iraqi vets on the way back home, two for leave, one for good. All three have been wounded. All three have deeper issues than the marks on their outer bodies. Thrown together by flight cancellations, they drive cross country and discover more about each other and themselves in the process.The film makes some subtle observations about society, though the insensitivity of some college students seemed a little much--maybe I've just never met such idiots. McAdams, as always, is likeable and easy to empathize with. Pena, despite one reviewer's distaste for him, is a very fine actor--compare his neurotic, hard-edged side here to the soft-hearted guy in ""Crash."" And Tim Robbins shows some real depth without overdoing it.The ending is not as predictable as it might seem halfway through. In some ways, the lack of predictability seems somewhat forced, but it also provides for a patriotic and poignant look at the struggles of those who serve our nation.

Back then you didn't see the honoring of veterans you do today. I am proud to be a part of the movement to push for the honoring of all who serve in combat. A brief scene in the movie features a couple of saps who are against the war. To these soldiers' honor, they silently tolerated the awkward, outdated foolishness of those characters...except for Rachel who had to(ahem) ""take care"" of a couple of snotty girls in the bar.One of the reasons so many V/N vets died after coming home from the war, were the movies that characterized veterans as grotesque charicatures, that led ultimately to V/N Vets chronic unemployment, and marital failure. That was wrong. The producers and directors of those lies became millionaires at the expense of veterans a thousand times more honorable, who are now dead - while the director owns his own vineyard. Isn't that special?Anyone who has served in the military, especially in a combat zone, or a family member of one will love this film. The script qualifies as 'literary', the acting, absolutely flawless. It's a simple story. Two soldiers each with a wound on 30 day home leave; and Tim Robbins who is also injured, but is mustering out. The story, though slow by 'action hero' standards...no flying, hurtling autos landing in fiery crashes...is nevertheless a ""page turner"". You can't leave the story for a minute. You have to see what happens next. This is good writing, acting, directing, and filming. We get to know each one of them very intimately. We hurt when they hurt, we laugh when they laugh, we cry when they cry, we exalt when they exalt. The term 'simple story' just does not do this film justice. It is far deeper than you would think. it will last as one of the great movies. True art , it has been said, is when a particular age, a specific culture is reflected and frozen in time for all of us to look back on in a hundred years and understand completely what 'that era was about'. Congratulations to all involved in this bona fide masterpiece of contemporary cinema. My hat is off, and I bow to Tim, Michael, and Rachel and the writers who gave us a believable story about three real people, ordinary people like you and I, who just happen to be courageous and selfless enough to leave their lives behind for this nation.

1208529,A5SC9O8TZJ6DK,B001KP2J2G,Gregory William Locke,"[0, 1]","The Lucky Ones was a great idea for a film. A road movie about three soldiers on leave, played my Rachel McAdams, Tim Robbins and Michael Pena. When these three soldiers - who are initially strangers - end up on a plane together (and eventually a rental car due to the grounding of planes) they're forced to spend time together, limping and driving across the country, battle scars everywhere.Directed by Neil Burger, known mostly for 2006's decent enough The Illusionist, The Lucky Ones feels like the work of a filmmaker who has ended up far out of his league. He seems to make some good decisions here and there (the film is well cast and the concept is strong), but, for a $14 million dollar film with three great leads, The Lucky Ones is a major disappointment. For starters, cinematographer Declan Quinn (In America, Rachel Getting Married, Leaving Las Vegas, Monsoon Wedding, etc.) doesn't give this film a $14 million dollar look. In fact, after a few scenes I got excited, thinking that this might be a true indie film with a tiny budget. It's not. And, unless Burger paid his stars big bucks, I can't figure out where the $14 million went - there's nothing in this film that should've cost much more than a Joe Swanberg or Andrew Bujalski film.And while that might seem like a petty complaint (seeing as how most movie watchers don't analyze such things), let me also take this opportunity to point out how sad it is to see Burger, who also wrote the film, piss away a great story idea. Three unconnected modern day soldiers end up stuck in a car together, crossing the country? How can you mess that up?! Especially when you have McAdams, Robbins, Pena and Quinn on your team? Burger finds a way.All that said, there are some enjoyable moments in this pedestrian piece of film art. Whenever the trio pass any sort of landmark or tourist trap, McAdams' character begs to stop, the other two denying her. They three all wake up at night with night terrors. We even get to see the endlessly soft-and-sweet McAdams start a fight at a college bar in southern Indiana where she's eventually backed up by her new solider pals. It could've been a classic moment. Unfortunately, it's not memorable and hardly believable, no matter how convincingly muscular McAdams' jaw and shoulders are. Robbins' and Pena's performances are strong throughout and McAdams' face continues to be the best screen face of her time. But, aside from these minor points, The Lucky Ones is a disappointment. Soldiers are, by average, living the most storyteller-worthy lives of any Americans right now, and this is all Berger can come up with? A bar fight and night terrors? Needless to say, this isn't a very deep or thoughtful film.And the use of music? Damn. Berger offers a selection of super obvious hipster picks mixed in with a score so cheesy that you have to doubt the vision of the director. F'real; it's that bad.I could go on, but why bother. Burger, who with The Illusionist became a director to watch, has become, with The Lucky Ones, a director who is going to have to fight for jobs, stars and production budgets.

The three get accidentally grouped together for a car trip from New York to Las Vegas and experience the difficulties of outsiders in an ambiguous situation.

T.K. (Michael Pena), a leader returning to his fianc&eacute;e in a precarious situation; Cheaver (Tim Robbins), an old veteran who is bidding adieu to his Army career but facing a home life that is potentially more volatile than war; and Colee (Rachel McAdams), a nave but fresh-faced Private returning a loved one's heirloom to his family while dragging around her bum leg.This wonderful tale of three soldiers sharing time on a cross-country road trip moves a bit slowly, but the realism, character development, and impeccable acting helps the pacing move along a bit.  Friendship among the three appears to be real, and their bond forms quickly as they learn about one another's life and troubles.  Charming chemistry is tough to come by; yet the camaraderie among these three returning soldiers feels genuine.Much like Home of the Brave, there are some unfortunate clich&eacute;s holding back the script.  Not all soldiers sleep in their PTs, all soldiers coming home from war do not have PTSD, and despite what Hollywood would have us believe, they don't resort to violence as a first response to difficult situations when they have difficulties fitting into ""normal"" society.  It's just a slanted view of troubled soldiers that gives the impression of people who are different from the rest of us, and I wish there were more movies that showed similarities instead of perceived differences.  Our society has evolved quite a bit since the post-Vietnam days.  I hate to say it, but I suspect this paragraph has something to do with Tim Robbins' politics.  Thankfully, Robbins doesn't let his beliefs get in the way too much, and the majority of the film rightfully shows detractors of the military as close-minded idiots.Despite the mixed politics and predictable ending, the majority of the movie is full of humor and humanity.  Subtle inertia seems to drive the characters' decisions, creating a heart-warming rendering of their time together.  Finding the positive side of one's misfortunes is what truly makes the beginnings of a hero; it's the ability to get back up after life has knocked you down.

1208534,A3PUVLBMBHDNWT,B001KP2J2G,Lissa,"[1, 1]","This movie does have its classic road trip moments, but when all is said and done it's a lot deeper than most of the road trip movies I've seen. And it's hilarious, often in the most surprising and creative ways. Colee, T.K. and Cheever are three soldiers coming home on leave, with not only very different backgrounds but very different goals. They travel together for convenience at first, but soon form a close attachment as they experience twists and turns on their journey that turn their expectations upside down.What's great about this movie is that although it could have been overly political, it isn't. It's not about the war in Iraq, it's about how the war has changed the personal lives of these individual soldiers. They encounter Americans that either deeply respect them or scorn them, and seeing things from their perspective, you see that though the scorn hurts, it is not because they approve of the war, but because the effect of the war on them is more of a personal issue rather than a political issue. They have lived it, and whether other people support the war or not, they have just tried to survive it. They are thinking more of how to pick up the pieces in their lives on their leave, and deal with the personal damage that any war can inflict on a soldier's life.The actors are all excellent and well-cast. Tim Robbins is believable as a humble man who just wants to do right by his family. Michael Pena is perfect as a proud, sometimes cocky young man who faces insecurity (for a pretty funny reason, although you definitely feel for him). But Rachel McAdams in particular really shines in this movie. I think this is probably the most complex role she's ever had, and she does a great job playing Colee, a spunky girl who provides a lot of comic relief on the trip, but at the same time is struggling with extreme loneliness.At its core, this movie is about three people who find companionship and help each other work through life-changing problems.

All three of them have been wounded while on active duty and are sent back home for 30 day rest.  Upon arrival to NYC airport their flights are canceled due to prolonged power outage and the three decide to share a rental car ride on their cross country treck to their respective homes.During their trip from east coast to the west they learn about each other's lives, how they were wounded and try to figure out their next move after 30 day leave is over.  The unexpected realities of the civilian life sends them a curveball that they try to resolve.  In spite of being relative strangers, all three are protective of each other in every possible sense.  Many of their adventures are humorous, but the end of their stories is definitely suprising.I absolutely loved this movie and I recommend it to everyone.

It also shows the other side of the story on how little civilians really understand about military experience and how at times, civilans can be disrespectful even if they mean well.",5,Bonding of three soldiers while they are on leave,1240444800,"04 23, 2009",2009,1304,"['Tim', 'Robbins', 'supporting', 'cast', 'McAdams', 'Pena', 'delivers', 'touching', 'story', 'three', 'wounded', 'soldiers', 'temporarily', 'back', 'home', 'US', 'serving', 'Iraq', 'three', 'have', 'been', 'wounded', 'active', 'duty', 'are', 'sent', 'back', 'home', '30', 'day', 'rest', 'arrival', 'NYC', 'airport', 'flights', 'are', 'canceled', 'due', 'prolonged', 'power', 'outage', 'three', 'decide', 'share', 'rental', 'car', 'ride', 'cross', 'country', 'treck', 'respective', 'homes.During', 'trip', 'east', 'coast', 'west', 'learn', 'other', 'lives', 'how', 'were', 'wounded', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'next', 'move', '30', 'day', 'leave', 'unexpected', 'realities', 'civilian', 'life', 'curveball', 'try', 'resolve', 'spite', 'being', 'relative', 'strangers', 'three', 'are', 'protective', 'other', 'possible', 'sense', 'Many', 'adventures', 'are', 'humorous', 'end', 'stories', 'definitely', 'suprising.I', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'movie', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'will', 'give', 'one', 'perspective', 'what', 'people', 'choose', 'become', 'soldiers', 'what', 'going', 'what', 'bringing', 'back', 'duty', 'also', 'other', 'side', 'story', 'how', 'little', 'civilians', 'really', 'understand', 'military', 'experience', 'how', 'times', 'civilans', 'can', 'be', 'disrespectful', 'even', 'mean', 'well']","Lucky Ones, The"

I like how these three soldiers stories are told at once and they don't get confusing or have some weird thing to do with each other like some movies do.  I thought they did a good job making you feel the pain each person is going through too.  I was hoping for a different ending, but I don't think it could have been too different at the same time.

Crawford,"[6, 8]","There are so many films like this, some people thrown together in a circumstance - this one coming home from the Iraq War to some bad surprises - and they become friends while traveling and find new meaning.  While the actors are quite wonderful, something about it didn't quite ring true for me and there was nothing whatsoever original about it.  There are borderline ridiculous many comedic scenes, but the tone is more serious than not.  You can't have frolicsome tragedy.  McAdams is far too beautiful to be a normal grunt and Robbins' personal crisis is too predictable and conventional.  Pena, I thought, was the best:  a tightly wound guy who slowly started to fall apart later on.  I also liked the presence of the killed boyfriend, who is a very real and evolving character thru the film.  Unfortunately, I was kind of waiting for it to end.Recommended.

Millisor ""vincentpricefan""","[1, 2]","Great, great, great movie that makes all the right choices and seems to have been totally unappreciated by critics for the classic it is.  The characters are so real in this one that by the end you don't want to leave them anymore than they wish to leave each other thoughout.  I thought the script was excellent and gives each actor their moments to shine.  It's unfortunate but I'm sure there will be some flag-wavers who won't want to view soldiers as real human beings, with their own doubts and fears, and will want to judge them as ""disloyal"" at times.  That totally misses the point of this movie since all 3 eventually make their way back to Iraq.  The movie shows just how complicated the war has made it for average Americans to feel about what is or what isn't patriotic.  But more than the war story, this movie has great chemistry going for it and if you're like me you'll be swept up in this dramatic comedy that at times can be laugh out loud funny.

I wasn't expecting much when I put the DVD in my player but before too long I knew I had stumbled on to something great.THE PLOT: Three soldiers coming back from Iraq meet at JFK in NY where all flights are delayed due to a blackout. One soldier is older and getting out of the Army for good (Timothy Robbins), one has a serious groin injury and is trying to heal-up (Michael Pena) and the other is on leave to visit the family of a dead comrade (Rachel McAdams). They end up in a rental vehicle traveling across the country where they experience many sides of American culture and each other's deepest secrets, hopes and pains.All three stars have great chemistry and Rachel McAdams (who I've never seen in a movie before) is a total revelation as Colee. Although Colee isn't highly educated she's not dumb. In fact, she excels socially and is the catalyst to hope and healing for the other two. A more beautiful, spunky, stimulating woman could hardly be found!Both Timothy Robbins as Cheaver and Michael Pena as TK shine in their roles as well. Cheaver becomes the necessary father-figure in the trio and the others become increasingly concerned about the well-being of their temporary ""dad.""The film features a good balance of Eastern and Western locations, shot in Illinois, Missouri, Colorado and Las Vegas.FINAL WORD: I don't want to say anymore.
