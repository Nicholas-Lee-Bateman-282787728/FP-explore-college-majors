The story revolves around Andrea Carson, a young teenage girl who enjoys motocross just as much as her twin brother Andrew. When he brother is injured, she assumes his identity on the track. The film tells the story on how she attempts to hide her true identity through a competition from both her fellow racers and also from her father, who does not approve of girls ridding motocross. Somewhat of a mix between a rated-G teen movie, Shakespeare's comedy ""Twelfth Night"", and Disney's animated ""Mulan"", ""Motocrossed"" is an interesting film for the entire family but especially for fans of the sport and young girls looking for another ""girl-power"" flick.",4,Nice Family Movie,1046390400,"02 28, 2003",2003,775,"['film', 'originally', 'produced', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'one', 'better', 'productions', 'come', 'cable', 'network', 'story', 'around', 'Andrea', 'Carson', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'motocross', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'twin', 'brother', 'Andrew', 'When', 'brother', 'injured', 'identity', 'track', 'film', 'story', 'how', 'hide', 'true', 'identity', 'competition', 'fellow', 'racers', 'also', 'father', 'who', 'not', 'approve', 'girls', 'ridding', 'motocross', 'Somewhat', 'mix', 'rated-G', 'teen', 'movie', 'Shakespeare', 'comedy', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'Disney', 'animated', 'Mulan', 'Motocrossed', 'interesting', 'film', 'entire', 'family', 'especially', 'fans', 'sport', 'young', 'girls', 'looking', 'girl-power', 'flick']",Motocrossed VHS

It almost makes you want to get into motocross racing!  There was friendship, romance, and of course, motocross, in this well-thought out and family friendly movie.  All the characters were enjoyable and easy to relate to.  Alana Austin was especially good as Andrea, the main character.Overall, I would say this was a great movie!

681670,A36N4UO9LQSQQL,B00005T5YG,thunderstorm264,"[5, 5]","Motocrossed is about the Carson family, which consists of dad Edward; mom Geneva; twins Andrew and Andrea; and youngest Jason. Andrew (Trever O'Brien) is an aspiring motocross racer, while his twin Andrea (Alana Austin) is a cheerleader with a tomboy side. The dad manages Andrew, and the mom supports the kids however she can. One day, though, Andrew and Andrea decided to race while their parents aren't home, and Andrew ends up hurting his leg; which, obviously, means he can't go to the big race in a few weeks! So the dad goes to Europe to find a new rider; and while he's gone, the race is moved up to that weekend. The dad can't come back because he doesn't know and the family can't get ahold of him, and if they miss that first race they can't qualify for the Cup. So Andrea cuts her hair and tries to pull off the race as her brother. But her mom finds out, and they eventually end up going anyway. There, Andrea meets Dean Talon (Riley Smith; total cutie), who helps show her the ropes of big-time racing in return for tips on how to get a date with his manager's daughter Farren Henderson. Andrea gets better, and Dean gets his girl, but Andrea also has a crush on Dean. Andrea eventually podiums, and just as all seems well, her dad finds out!That's all I'm gonna tell you. This is a great family film, but I think teens would enjoy it on their own; I do. The music is pretty good, the motocross scenes rock, and there is some definite eye candy (i.e., Riley Smith, Trever O'Brien...). The acting is good, and the plot is good as well. This is one not to be missed.",5,One of the better DCOMs!,1030665600,"08 30, 2002",2002,1578,"['Motocrossed', 'Carson', 'family', 'dad', 'Edward', 'mom', 'Geneva', 'Andrew', 'Andrea', 'youngest', 'Jason', 'Andrew', 'Trever', ""O'Brien"", 'aspiring', 'motocross', 'racer', 'twin', 'Andrea', 'Alana', 'Austin', 'cheerleader', 'tomboy', 'side', 'dad', 'Andrew', 'mom', 'kids', 'however', 'can', 'One', 'day', 'though', 'Andrew', 'Andrea', 'decided', 'race', 'parents', 'are', ""n't"", 'home', 'Andrew', 'up', 'hurting', 'leg', 'obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'big', 'race', 'few', 'weeks', 'dad', 'Europe', 'find', 'new', 'rider', 'gone', 'race', 'moved', 'up', 'weekend', 'dad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', ""n't"", 'know', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'ahold', 'miss', 'first', 'race', 'ca', ""n't"", 'qualify', 'Cup', 'So', 'Andrea', 'hair', 'tries', 'pull', 'off', 'race', 'brother', 'mom', 'out', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'anyway', 'Andrea', 'Dean', 'Talon', 'Riley', 'Smith', 'total', 'cutie', 'who', 'show', 'ropes', 'big-time', 'racing', 'return', 'tips', 'how', 'get', 'date', 'manager', 'daughter', 'Farren', 'Henderson', 'Andrea', 'better', 'Dean', 'girl', 'Andrea', 'also', 'crush', 'Dean', 'Andrea', 'eventually', 'podiums', 'just', 'well', 'dad', 'out', ""'m"", 'gon', 'tell', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'think', 'teens', 'would', 'enjoy', 'own', 'do', 'music', 'pretty', 'good', 'motocross', 'scenes', 'rock', 'definite', 'eye', 'candy', 'i.e.', 'Riley', 'Smith', 'Trever', ""O'Brien"", 'acting', 'good', 'plot', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Motocrossed VHS
