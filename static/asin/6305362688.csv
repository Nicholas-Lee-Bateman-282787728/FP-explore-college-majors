KIRIAKOPOULOS ""iceman""","[3, 5]",Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami is taking you for a ride around Teheran through his hero in the movie Mr. Badii (Homayoun Ershadi).Silence misery povetry and the mixture of different cultures give you the sense that something is going to die in this place and reborn from the ashes. Amazing photography travells you to Iranian landscape taking its time exactly like the oriental mentality. The people dont talk very much or they dont talk at all.What you want to know it is written on their faces on their clothes and the enviroment.Dont look for western type of action dont even look for a story everything you see is symbolic.Just concetrate on what you see and believe me if you never experienced before the taste of cherry you will now and you will never forget it.,5,HOW IRAN LOOKS TODAY?,1021766400,"05 19, 2002",2002,771,"['Iranian', 'director', 'Abbas', 'Kiarostami', 'taking', 'ride', 'Teheran', 'hero', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'Homayoun', 'Ershadi', '.Silence', 'misery', 'povetry', 'mixture', 'different', 'cultures', 'give', 'sense', 'something', 'going', 'die', 'place', 'reborn', 'ashes', 'Amazing', 'photography', 'travells', 'Iranian', 'landscape', 'taking', 'time', 'exactly', 'oriental', 'mentality', 'people', 'dont', 'talk', 'very', 'much', 'dont', 'talk', 'want', 'know', 'written', 'clothes', 'enviroment.Dont', 'look', 'western', 'type', 'action', 'dont', 'even', 'look', 'story', 'everything', 'see', 'symbolic.Just', 'concetrate', 'what', 'see', 'believe', 'never', 'experienced', 'taste', 'cherry', 'will', 'now', 'will', 'never', 'forget']",Taste of Cherry

Some say it's a slow, pretenious, boring film while others dare call it a masterpiece. A beautifully constructed film that was done with compassion and care. No doubt you can tell which group I belong to by the amount of stars I've given the film. But, that doesn't mean I am unable to see both sides of the film myself. As I first started watching this film, I too, became not bored, but, disillusioned with it. I was expecting something completely different, and was not prepared to see a movie which mostly takes place in the main character's van. Now, this does not mean I did not appreciate the obvious craft inwhich this film had been done with. I thought the cinematography was wonderful, the acting by Homayon Ershadi who plays Mr. Badi was enjoyable to watch, and the film was directed with style by Abbas Kiarostami.Some might be tempted to say this is Kiarostami's version of Ingmar Bergman's &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, while that's not entirely true, I can understand why one would say that. Both films try to come to some conclusion as to the meaning of life. What is life all about? How does one find happiness? I admit I like Bergman's film better, but, &quot;Taste of Cherry&quot; in its own way is just as compelling and spellbinding. It has a more subtle tone to it then &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;. There are moments where the film does have a tendency to lag a bit, but, when the film starts to take shape, it's one powerful film.The story-line of &quot;Taste of Cherry&quot; as many if not everyone knows is about a man, Mr. Badii, who wants to committ suicide. His only problem is he cann't find anyone to bury him. This leads him on his own journey to find someone to do this deed. After searching and searching for someone, he finds Mr. Bagheri (Abdolrahman Bagheri). Its when these two meet that &quot;Taste of Cherry&quot; comes full circle. Now, there will be those who say, well, can you really say a movie is good if it only has 20 minutes or so that work? If they managed to swell up the feeling that those 20 minutes do, then yes! But, I do also feel that there is more than just 20 minutes or so of this film that works. &quot;Taste of Cherry&quot; is a wonderful film that is not for all tastes, but, for those who have enjoyed it, and those that might come to enjoy it in the future, we know there are few films that can do what this one does.",4,A &quot;Taste&quot; Of Life!,1010102400,"01 4, 2002",2002,2503,"['read', 'viewer', 'comments', 'film', 'clearly', 'evident', ""'re"", 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'public', 'taken', 'say', 'slow', 'pretenious', 'boring', 'film', 'others', 'dare', 'call', 'masterpiece', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'compassion', 'care', 'doubt', 'can', 'tell', 'group', 'belong', 'amount', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'given', 'film', ""n't"", 'mean', 'am', 'unable', 'see', 'sides', 'film', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'film', 'too', 'became', 'not', 'bored', 'disillusioned', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'see', 'movie', 'mostly', 'place', 'main', 'character', 'van', 'Now', 'not', 'mean', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'obvious', 'craft', 'inwhich', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'thought', 'cinematography', 'was', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'Homayon', 'Ershadi', 'who', 'Mr.', 'Badi', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'style', 'Abbas', 'Kiarostami.Some', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'say', 'Kiarostami', 'version', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'quot', 'Seventh', 'Seal', 'quot', 'not', 'entirely', 'true', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'one', 'would', 'say', 'films', 'try', 'come', 'conclusion', 'meaning', 'life', 'What', 'life', 'How', 'one', 'find', 'happiness', 'admit', 'Bergman', 'film', 'better', 'quot', 'Taste', 'Cherry', 'quot', 'own', 'way', 'just', 'compelling', 'spellbinding', 'more', 'subtle', 'tone', 'then', 'quot', 'Seventh', 'Seal', 'quot', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'film', 'have', 'tendency', 'lag', 'bit', 'when', 'film', 'take', 'shape', 'one', 'powerful', 'film.The', 'story-line', 'quot', 'Taste', 'Cherry', 'quot', 'many', 'not', 'everyone', 'man', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'who', 'committ', 'suicide', 'only', 'problem', 'can', ""n't"", 'find', 'anyone', 'bury', 'own', 'journey', 'find', 'someone', 'do', 'deed', 'searching', 'searching', 'someone', 'Mr.', 'Bagheri', 'Abdolrahman', 'Bagheri', 'when', 'two', 'meet', 'quot', 'Taste', 'Cherry', 'quot', 'full', 'circle', 'Now', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'say', 'well', 'can', 'really', 'say', 'movie', 'good', 'only', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'work', 'managed', 'swell', 'up', 'feeling', '20', 'minutes', 'do', 'then', 'yes', 'do', 'also', 'feel', 'more', 'just', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'quot', 'Taste', 'Cherry', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'film', 'not', 'tastes', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'might', 'come', 'enjoy', 'future', 'know', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'one']",Taste of Cherry
461236,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305362688,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","You ever notice how the best films out there are the films that `aren't for everyone'?  I was thinking about that while I was watching this film.  I kept thinking `this film certainly isn't for everyone' and I tend to think that a lot when watching films I adore.  The fact remains that films that can be classified as `for everyone' are generally your generic Hollywood feel good films.  The reason those films that don't appeal to everyone are so great is that they appeal strongly to you.  They have that certain something that reaches a personal place inside you, moving you in ways that it may not (or will not) move someone else.`Ta'm e Guilass' is that type of a film.The film takes place on one day in one place, a car.  That car belongs to Mr. Badii, a wealthy middle aged man who is looking for someone to help him commit suicide.  It's a hard request because beliefs on suicide vary and some are strongly apposed.  He just wants someone who will bury him after he's committed the act, and he will even pay handsomely, but still, finding someone willing is a difficult task.There may be minor spoilers below...The film may be too slow or uneventful for many, but it is within the films quiet center that the action really exists.  We never know the reason for which Mr. Badii wants to die, but it doesn't matter.  We understand him so implicitly because of his undoubted pain and sorrow.  I think that leaving the end open so-to-speak (on all fronts) was a genius idea here because we are allowed to truly contemplate who this man was, bringing him to a person level of understanding and even begin to relate to him.Wiether we have had similar thoughts of welcoming death or not, we have all felt a pain that at a time felt unbearable.Homayoun Ershadi is sensational here.  His eyes pierce the soul and deliver more than any explanation or confession could have.  He conveys the very pit of this man through a silent acquisition of sorts.It is no wonder to me that this won top honors at the Cannes film festival.  Abbas Kiarostami's tender and personal film is a provocative look at pain and sorrow, but also of hope.  As the film draws towards it's conclusion we are left wondering if Mr. Badii was as moved as we were by the pleading of his eventual `helper'.  His monologue about the mulberries is so passionate and effective that we are renewed in our convictions that life IS worth living.But did Mr. Badii feel the same?",5,Who wants to forget the taste of cherries?,1269907200,"03 30, 2010",2010,2437,"['ever', 'notice', 'how', 'best', 'films', 'out', 'are', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'was', 'thinking', 'while', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'kept', 'thinking', 'film', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'tend', 'think', 'lot', 'when', 'watching', 'films', 'adore', 'fact', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'classified', 'everyone', 'are', 'generally', 'generic', 'Hollywood', 'feel', 'good', 'films', 'reason', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everyone', 'are', 'so', 'great', 'appeal', 'strongly', 'have', 'certain', 'something', 'personal', 'place', 'moving', 'ways', 'may', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'move', 'someone', 'else.', 'Ta', ""'m"", 'e', 'Guilass', 'type', 'film.The', 'film', 'place', 'one', 'day', 'one', 'place', 'car', 'car', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'wealthy', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'who', 'looking', 'someone', 'help', 'commit', 'suicide', 'hard', 'request', 'beliefs', 'suicide', 'vary', 'are', 'strongly', 'apposed', 'just', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'bury', 'committed', 'act', 'will', 'even', 'pay', 'handsomely', 'still', 'finding', 'someone', 'willing', 'difficult', 'task.There', 'may', 'be', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'slow', 'uneventful', 'many', 'films', 'quiet', 'center', 'action', 'really', 'never', 'know', 'reason', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'die', ""n't"", 'matter', 'understand', 'so', 'implicitly', 'undoubted', 'pain', 'sorrow', 'think', 'leaving', 'end', 'open', 'so-to-speak', 'fronts', 'was', 'genius', 'idea', 'here', 'are', 'allowed', 'truly', 'contemplate', 'who', 'man', 'was', 'bringing', 'person', 'level', 'understanding', 'even', 'begin', 'relate', 'have', 'had', 'similar', 'thoughts', 'welcoming', 'death', 'not', 'have', 'felt', 'pain', 'time', 'felt', 'unbearable.Homayoun', 'Ershadi', 'sensational', 'here', 'eyes', 'pierce', 'soul', 'deliver', 'more', 'explanation', 'confession', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'pit', 'man', 'silent', 'acquisition', 'sorts.It', 'wonder', 'won', 'top', 'honors', 'Cannes', 'film', 'festival', 'Abbas', 'Kiarostami', 'tender', 'personal', 'film', 'provocative', 'look', 'pain', 'sorrow', 'also', 'hope', 'film', 'conclusion', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'was', 'as', 'moved', 'were', 'pleading', 'eventual', 'helper', 'monologue', 'mulberries', 'so', 'passionate', 'effective', 'are', 'renewed', 'convictions', 'life', 'IS', 'worth', 'living.But', 'did', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'feel', 'same']",Taste of Cherry

I always had a lot of respect for the Iranian culture but after the Shah there was not much around.  The Islam revolutionaries were more into distruction of culture than into developing one.

And only on the third time I could understand questions I had before.I rated this film five stars.  Why?  I had to realise the problems experienced by the producers and the actors while filming it.

461241,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6305362688,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[4, 4]","There is the old, and often neglected, nostrum about `gilding the lily.' I was reminded of this watching Abbas Kiarostami's acclaimed 1997 film Taste Of Cherry (Ta'm E Guilass), co-winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, for while it comes close to being a great film for the bulk of its running time of 99 minutes (not the oft-claimed 95 minutes), its much discussed ending, of breaking the fourth wall (ala Ingmar Bergman, circa the 1960s) to reveal what has just been witnessed is all a film, is one of the worst endings for a film of quality I've seen; perhaps even worse than the tacked on uplifting ending to Akira Kurosawa's otherwise stellar Rashomon. The basic problem with the ending is that, unlike in Bergman's run of self-conscious films (Persona, Hour Of The Wolf, Shame), the big `revelation' that the film is a film comes after we've sat through it; assuming that even such a fourth wall braking could surprise one in these times. Even worse is that it undermines the penultimate scene, which is a better- if not great ending, but one which would arguably qualify Taste Of Cherry as a great film overall. And it is an all Kiarostami film, good or bad, as he produced, wrote, and edited, as well as directed it.Critics, pro and con, have prattled on about Kiarostami's meaning or intent, in regard to the videotaped, not filmed, ending of verdant hills (contrasting with the rest of the film's ruddy barren rock landscapes), but always seem to miss the result, which is that it emotionally deflates the whole story. They claim things such as Kiarostami's abnegation of preachiness, a disdain for tearjerking, some psychological reason why the reveal of the film's fictive nature, at its end, is profound, or his desire to make indeterminacy the film's major motif. Yet, before the ending of the film, it is not preachy, jerks no tears, is clearly fictive, and the penultimate scene spells out indeterminacy far more powerfully and cogently than the ending does. When confronted by such realities as this it is always amusing to watch fans of an artist alibi for failure when the simplest answer is simply failure- that Kiarostami did not believe enough in his film to let it end at its best point. And what the filmmaker desired to achieve, if any aside from himself could divine such a thing, is immaterial to the viewer.Taste Of Cherry has moments of rapturous almost pure cinema, where the visuals alone can sustain the film and indeed do last longer than the lesser parts of the film, but, ultimately, that quality and its often clever script, are undone by the ending. It does not ruin the film, in terms of making it a bad film, but it does keep it from the elusive goal of greatness, for it plays out as an attempt at innovation when, in reality, it was already decades pass&eacute; (as well as being inappropriate to end the film). Kiarostami's film views the human from a telescopic and microscopic position, and which is the more revealing is debatable. That such an innovative approach is substantially ruined by the poor ending is a shame, even if as human as the dilemma it traces.",4,Good,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,3123,"['old', 'often', 'neglected', 'gilding', 'lily', 'was', 'reminded', 'watching', 'Abbas', 'Kiarostami', 'acclaimed', '1997', 'film', 'Taste', 'Cherry', 'Ta', ""'m"", 'E', 'Guilass', 'co-winner', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'close', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'bulk', 'running', 'time', '99', 'minutes', 'not', 'oft-claimed', '95', 'minutes', 'much', 'discussed', 'ending', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'ala', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'circa', '1960s', 'reveal', 'what', 'just', 'been', 'witnessed', 'film', 'one', 'worst', 'endings', 'film', 'quality', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'perhaps', 'even', 'worse', 'tacked', 'uplifting', 'ending', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'otherwise', 'stellar', 'Rashomon', 'basic', 'problem', 'ending', 'Bergman', 'run', 'self-conscious', 'films', 'Persona', 'Hour', 'Wolf', 'Shame', 'big', 'revelation', 'film', 'film', ""'ve"", 'sat', 'assuming', 'even', 'fourth', 'wall', 'braking', 'could', 'surprise', 'one', 'times', 'Even', 'worse', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'better-', 'not', 'great', 'ending', 'one', 'would', 'arguably', 'qualify', 'Taste', 'Cherry', 'great', 'film', 'overall', 'Kiarostami', 'film', 'good', 'bad', 'produced', 'wrote', 'edited', 'as', 'well', 'directed', 'it.Critics', 'pro', 'con', 'have', 'prattled', 'Kiarostami', 'meaning', 'intent', 'regard', 'videotaped', 'not', 'filmed', 'ending', 'verdant', 'hills', 'contrasting', 'rest', 'film', 'ruddy', 'barren', 'rock', 'landscapes', 'always', 'seem', 'miss', 'result', 'emotionally', 'whole', 'story', 'claim', 'things', 'such', 'Kiarostami', 'abnegation', 'preachiness', 'disdain', 'tearjerking', 'psychological', 'reason', 'why', 'reveal', 'film', 'fictive', 'nature', 'end', 'profound', 'desire', 'make', 'indeterminacy', 'film', 'major', 'motif', 'ending', 'film', 'not', 'preachy', 'tears', 'clearly', 'fictive', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'out', 'indeterminacy', 'far', 'more', 'powerfully', 'cogently', 'ending', 'When', 'confronted', 'such', 'realities', 'always', 'amusing', 'watch', 'fans', 'artist', 'alibi', 'failure', 'when', 'simplest', 'answer', 'simply', 'failure-', 'Kiarostami', 'did', 'not', 'believe', 'enough', 'film', 'let', 'end', 'best', 'point', 'what', 'filmmaker', 'desired', 'achieve', 'aside', 'could', 'divine', 'thing', 'immaterial', 'viewer.Taste', 'Cherry', 'moments', 'rapturous', 'almost', 'pure', 'cinema', 'where', 'visuals', 'alone', 'can', 'sustain', 'film', 'indeed', 'do', 'last', 'longer', 'lesser', 'parts', 'film', 'ultimately', 'quality', 'often', 'clever', 'script', 'are', 'undone', 'ending', 'not', 'ruin', 'film', 'terms', 'making', 'bad', 'film', 'keep', 'elusive', 'goal', 'greatness', 'out', 'attempt', 'innovation', 'when', 'reality', 'was', 'already', 'decades', 'pass', 'eacute', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'inappropriate', 'end', 'film', 'Kiarostami', 'film', 'human', 'telescopic', 'microscopic', 'position', 'more', 'revealing', 'debatable', 'such', 'innovative', 'approach', 'substantially', 'ruined', 'poor', 'ending', 'shame', 'even', 'as', 'human', 'dilemma']",Taste of Cherry

No attempt at paraphrase or rhetoric can add to what's already there on the screen. You might want to talk about the technical features, the lack of music, the point of view shots in the car, the beautifully desolate views of the hills around Tehran,the ambiguity of the ending - it's all just noise in my opinion. This film (like any other of true quality) is not what people say about it. It's to be experienced.

A deftly handled and sensitive tale of a sensitive subject... the contemplation of suicide. The tale is set in modern day Tehran, and it slowly follows the story of  a relatively successful man who drives around, and as the viewer learns, is searching for someone who will help him to kill himself. He meets a succession of individuals and discusses his plans with them. Each man provides his own thoughts on the subject, all ultimately refusing to go along with the plan.

This film is one of Abbas Kiarostami's best films, and the first film from Iran to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes.  It's a hypnotic, fascinating, and intelligent film, which deals with many complex issues.  The film concerns itself with a man driving around Tehran looking for somebody either to kill him or rescue him.  It's really striking the way Kiarostami films things, as there is much driving, many long takes (which are all beautifully filmed), and sometimes Kiarostami lets his camera linger on one of the characters of the shot while never showing the other character.  There is a long conversation at a construction site with the watchman of the site, and during a 2 1/2 minute unbroken take, you only see the main character while listening to the other character.  These directorial decisions never feel forced, but very natural and beautiful.  The cinematography (and terrain) around Tehran is visually stunning, and the performances are top notch here.  The film is also very ambiguous, and never really provides a solid conclusion.  This is one of Kiarostami's finest achievements (even though I like The Wind Will Carry Us more than this film), and it's a great introduction to the poetic, deeply artistic Iranian cinema.",5,"A unique piece of cinema...beautifully filmed, one of Kiarostami's (and Iranian cinema's) best films....",1220400000,"09 3, 2008",2008,1310,"['was', 'introduction', 'Iranian', 'cinema', 'fine', 'introduction', 'film', 'one', 'Abbas', 'Kiarostami', 'best', 'films', 'first', 'film', 'Iran', 'win', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", 'Cannes', 'hypnotic', 'fascinating', 'intelligent', 'film', 'many', 'complex', 'issues', 'film', 'concerns', 'man', 'driving', 'Tehran', 'looking', 'somebody', 'kill', 'rescue', 'really', 'striking', 'way', 'Kiarostami', 'films', 'things', 'much', 'driving', 'many', 'long', 'are', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'sometimes', 'Kiarostami', 'camera', 'linger', 'one', 'characters', 'shot', 'never', 'showing', 'other', 'character', 'long', 'conversation', 'construction', 'site', 'watchman', 'site', '2', '1/2', 'minute', 'unbroken', 'take', 'only', 'see', 'main', 'character', 'listening', 'other', 'character', 'directorial', 'decisions', 'never', 'feel', 'forced', 'very', 'natural', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'terrain', 'Tehran', 'visually', 'stunning', 'performances', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'here', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'ambiguous', 'never', 'really', 'solid', 'conclusion', 'one', 'Kiarostami', 'finest', 'achievements', 'even', 'like', 'Wind', 'Will', 'Carry', 'Us', 'more', 'film', 'great', 'introduction', 'poetic', 'deeply', 'artistic', 'Iranian', 'cinema']",Taste of Cherry

461248,A3OD7GOXPSO9Z,6305362688,JLR,"[0, 2]","Critics honestly think that this is a masterpiece? I rented the Criterion DVD from the public library earlier this week and watched it twice. First time I saw it, I was bored senseless from beginning to end. Then I watched it the second time to try the grasp the supposed depth and meaning, only to feel regret for having to relive the whole experience again. One critic praised the film for establishing ""a desperately needed affirmation of cinema"". Whatever that means.To give you an indication of just how unbearable the experience was, the first 11 minutes of the movie is basically the main protagonist driving through the town and the barren industrial hills interacting with people. Sounds interesting, right? Here's the kicker: nothing happens. Nothing to drive the story, nothing to get us to identify with the character, nothing to show what kind of territory he inhabits, even the camera shots of the driver never change. Only one mild incident occurs, when one of the pedestrians threaten to punch the main character in the face if he doesn't leave. I wish he did, so that he could have saved me from 90 more minutes of torture.Finally, the opening credits roll and what happens after the end? We find ourselves in the car again. Still the same ridiculous medium shot of the driver. Still the same irritatingly emotionless driver. But this time, he picks up some adolescent who turns out to be a soldier. Why does he want to pick up random men off the streets? Is this movie about homosexuality? Is the character a cab driver? We find out that the soldier has a lousy job at the barracks, that he lives with his mother's janitor husband and that he's on holiday. Of course, this still doesn't explain why the driver picked him up, nor does it tell us anything about him. While this is going on, I am nearly an inch away from pressing the eject button on my remote.After three boring, monotonous minutes (which could have been cut by 2 ), we find out that the driver is offering a job. But instead of telling us what it is (cause that would make TOO MUCH sense, even by art house standards), he talks about his time in regiment, teaches the soldier how to count and patronizes him for not acting like a friend. So finally, the soldier (and by a larger extension, the audience) asks what kind of job the driver is offering. And naturally, not only does the driver NOT tell him what it is, but says that it's wise to just do the job and not ask questions, although why we had to wait FIVE MINUTES after the credits to hear THAT is beyond the point of sanity.By the 22-minute mark, the soldier finally argues with the driver that he wants to get out of the car (which any sensible stranger would do at this point). So at 25 minutes, we FINALLY find out the driver's name (Mr. Badii) and that the job for the kid is to bury him alive. Why the director couldn't just clarify that in a couple of minutes instead of 11 is beyond me, but then again, nothing in this film makes sense. Mr. Badii begs him to perform the task (is the driver gay? Who the hell knows?), until the soldier can't take it anymore and runs down the hill. So the whole point of these 32 meaningless minutes? Seeing a kid run down the hill. Sheesh.The rest of the movie is every bit as interminable as the first 32 minutes. For a good portion of the movie, all you get are endless scenes of Mr. Badii driving around the hills and engaging in useless conversations with strangers, only to be denied being buried. The first refuses because suicide is against his religious beliefs (the scene, of course, lasts an excruciating ten minutes) and the second is a taxidermist who fails to convinces Badii to evade suicide. You could fast-forward for 5 minutes at any point and not miss a thing. A talented director would have compressed all this into a 7-15 minute short, but why does Kiarostami make us watch 95 minutes of a guy driving around the hills? To teach kids how to get a driver`s license? Good grief.But wait, forget the nonexistent plot or characterization. We're supposed to admire its cinematography. Big deal. There are hundreds of excllent American, European and Japanese movies that have used cinematography for relevant purposes, such as creating a mood, establishing a tone, defining a character, providing exposition, enhancing excitement or/and telling a story. Since Kiarostami doesn't do any of them, those lovely shots of that stupid quarry and those endless hills mean nothing. And if the director was American, critics would dump THIS movie in the quarry as well.The dialogue is unimaginative to the point of banal. Before watching this movie, I never thought Iranian civilians spoke like a bunch of robots. Every single one of them talks like they're looking at cue cards off the screen. I know that Iran is notorious for its artistic censorship, but there's no way you're that censored into delivering lines straight out of a wooden dummy.To conclude, this movie stinks. Aside from the fact that it was shot in Iran, ""Taste of Cherry"" features the same art-house cliches where characterization and story are disregarded in favor of photography, the same tiresome stock characters where the protagonists are either passive or randomly motivated, the same useless scenes that serve no purpose and a hackneyed ending where everything was revealed to be a movie. If this is the future of movies, I'd rather watch Michael Bay films.Some critics believe that ""Taste of Cherry"" works as a meditation of life and death. No other description is more appropriate, since this movie is all death and no life. If you want better art house movies that deal extensively with themes of reaffirming life and coming in terms with death, pick up ""Ordet"", ""The Seventh Seal"", ""Diary of a Country Priest"" or ""Ikiru"". And if you want a terrific Iranian movie, watch ""The Day I Became a Woman"".

He has a specific task in mind, but drives away without saying a word. His name is Mr. Badii (Homayon Ershadi), and he is seeking an assistant for his planned suicide. He stops to ask strangers about their financial state, surreptitiously interviewing them for the reprehensible job, but leaves without declaring his intentions. He offers a ride to a young soldier (Safar Ali Moradi) on his way back to the barracks. An overhead crane shot follows their vehicle weaving through the narrow, unpaved roads as he drives the soldier to a remote basin where he has dug his burial plot at the foot of a tree. He sees a filial bond with the soft-spoken young man, having himself served in the military, and Mr. Badii reveals his plan: the next day, he asks that the soldier call to him twice. If he responds, the soldier will save him (and literally help him out of the hole that he has dug for himself). If he does not answer, then the soldier will throw twenty spadefuls of earth into the hole and bury him. The young man is horrified by his plan, and runs away. Mr. Badii then begins to follow an earth-moving vehicle and ends up at a closed cement factory occupied by a security guard (Ahmad Ansari) and a seminarist (Hossein Noori) on holiday. He attempts to recruit the religious man by appealing to his compassion, but to no avail. Instead, the gentle seminarist offers him a receptive ear and teachings from the Koran. Disappointed, he leaves the factory and comes upon a construction site, stopping to rest. Note the juxtaposition of Mr. Badii's shadow against the pouring soil. Eventually, he offers a ride to a talkative old man named Mr. Bagheri (Abdolhossein Bagheri) who works at the museum of natural history. Coincidentally, years earlier, Mr. Bagheri had attempted to commit suicide, but was inspirited by the presence of mulberries under his feet. He disapproves of Mr. Badii's plan, but his son's illness compels him to accept the regrettable assignment.Abbas Kiarostami creates a visually austere and serenely contemplative examination of life in A Taste of Cherry: the unchanging, barren scenery outside the car window; the desolate, winding roads leading to the burial plot; the suffocating dust of the construction site. The barren, almost monochromatic landscape serves as a metaphor for the isolation of the soul. In essence, A Taste of Cherry is not about a man's search for death, but his search for a reason for living. By rejecting the laborers (who are undoubtedly qualified to bury him) in favor of his passengers, he is seeking empathy and connection. In the end, a chromatic shift transforms the empty landscape into a lush countryside. Perhaps, Mr. Badii, like Mr. Bagheri before him, has changed his own perspective.",5,Superb,1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,2877,"['impassive', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'busy', 'urban', 'traffic', 'city', 'approached', 'several', 'day', 'laborers', 'hire', 'specific', 'task', 'mind', 'away', 'saying', 'word', 'name', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'Homayon', 'Ershadi', 'seeking', 'assistant', 'planned', 'suicide', 'ask', 'strangers', 'financial', 'state', 'surreptitiously', 'interviewing', 'reprehensible', 'job', 'declaring', 'intentions', 'ride', 'young', 'soldier', 'Safar', 'Ali', 'Moradi', 'way', 'back', 'barracks', 'overhead', 'crane', 'shot', 'vehicle', 'weaving', 'narrow', 'unpaved', 'roads', 'soldier', 'remote', 'basin', 'where', 'dug', 'burial', 'plot', 'foot', 'tree', 'filial', 'bond', 'soft-spoken', 'young', 'man', 'having', 'served', 'military', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'plan', 'next', 'day', 'soldier', 'call', 'twice', 'soldier', 'will', 'save', 'literally', 'help', 'hole', 'dug', 'not', 'answer', 'then', 'soldier', 'will', 'throw', 'twenty', 'spadefuls', 'earth', 'hole', 'bury', 'young', 'man', 'horrified', 'plan', 'away', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'then', 'follow', 'earth-moving', 'vehicle', 'up', 'closed', 'cement', 'factory', 'occupied', 'security', 'guard', 'Ahmad', 'Ansari', 'seminarist', 'Hossein', 'Noori', 'holiday', 'recruit', 'religious', 'man', 'appealing', 'compassion', 'avail', 'Instead', 'gentle', 'seminarist', 'receptive', 'ear', 'teachings', 'Koran', 'Disappointed', 'factory', 'construction', 'site', 'stopping', 'rest', 'Note', 'juxtaposition', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'shadow', 'pouring', 'soil', 'Eventually', 'ride', 'talkative', 'old', 'man', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Bagheri', 'Abdolhossein', 'Bagheri', 'who', 'museum', 'natural', 'history', 'Coincidentally', 'years', 'earlier', 'Mr.', 'Bagheri', 'had', 'attempted', 'commit', 'suicide', 'was', 'inspirited', 'presence', 'mulberries', 'feet', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'plan', 'son', 'illness', 'compels', 'accept', 'regrettable', 'assignment.Abbas', 'Kiarostami', 'visually', 'austere', 'serenely', 'contemplative', 'examination', 'life', 'A', 'Taste', 'Cherry', 'unchanging', 'barren', 'scenery', 'car', 'window', 'desolate', 'winding', 'roads', 'leading', 'burial', 'plot', 'suffocating', 'dust', 'construction', 'site', 'barren', 'almost', 'monochromatic', 'landscape', 'serves', 'metaphor', 'isolation', 'soul', 'essence', 'A', 'Taste', 'Cherry', 'not', 'man', 'search', 'death', 'search', 'reason', 'living', 'rejecting', 'laborers', 'who', 'are', 'undoubtedly', 'qualified', 'bury', 'favor', 'passengers', 'seeking', 'empathy', 'connection', 'end', 'chromatic', 'shift', 'empty', 'landscape', 'lush', 'countryside', 'Perhaps', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'Mr.', 'Bagheri', 'changed', 'own', 'perspective']",Taste of Cherry

There's just not much here to justify the running time.  The improvised conversations are only moderately interesting (and that's assuming you survive the first major one, with the soldier, which is virtually content-free).  The characters are close to being ciphers; I could live with not knowing why Mr. Badii's doing what he's doing, but he hardly says anything personal about anything (&quot;I enjoyed my time in the army&quot; is about as deep as we get).  The shots of roads are not much more artful than random shooting out of a car window with a video camera (at least Antonioni's or Tarkovsky's films are exquisite even when maddeningly empty).  The message is basically the same as the one in American Beauty (life is wonderful because of some quotidian detail of day to day existence).  This is a fairly large bag to hold such a small thought, and it's got a lot of room to bounce around in undisturbed by any others.Compare to another recent Criterion release, Dreyer's Day of Wrath, and you'll see the difference between a filmmaker at peak intensity during every second of a slowly-paced film, and one merely mistaking tedium for significance.",2,It's not just that this is slow...,1012521600,"02 1, 2002",2002,1463,"['not', 'just', 'slow', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', 'Dreyer', 'Bresson', 'Ozu', 'are', 'extremely', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'better', 'concentrate', 'viewer', 'minute', 'details', 'tiny', 'tremors', 'feeling.It', 'slow', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'much', 'deserve', 'concentration', 'required', 'just', 'not', 'much', 'here', 'justify', 'running', 'time', 'improvised', 'conversations', 'are', 'only', 'moderately', 'interesting', 'assuming', 'survive', 'first', 'major', 'one', 'soldier', 'virtually', 'content-free', 'characters', 'are', 'close', 'being', 'ciphers', 'could', 'live', 'not', 'knowing', 'why', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'doing', 'what', 'doing', 'hardly', 'anything', 'personal', 'anything', 'quot', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'army', 'quot', 'as', 'deep', 'get', 'shots', 'roads', 'are', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'artful', 'random', 'shooting', 'car', 'window', 'video', 'camera', 'least', 'Antonioni', 'Tarkovsky', 'films', 'are', 'exquisite', 'even', 'when', 'maddeningly', 'empty', 'message', 'basically', 'same', 'one', 'American', 'Beauty', 'life', 'wonderful', 'quotidian', 'detail', 'day', 'day', 'existence', 'fairly', 'large', 'bag', 'hold', 'such', 'small', 'thought', 'got', 'lot', 'room', 'bounce', 'around', 'undisturbed', 'others.Compare', 'recent', 'Criterion', 'release', 'Dreyer', 'Day', 'Wrath', ""'ll"", 'see', 'difference', 'filmmaker', 'peak', 'intensity', 'second', 'slowly-paced', 'film', 'one', 'merely', 'mistaking', 'tedium', 'significance']",Taste of Cherry

461254,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,6305362688,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[1, 1]","A middle-aged and middle class man drives through the streets of Tehran, searching for someone who might assist him.  He turns away the eager men who crowd his window, in hopes of being hired for day labor.  It's not clear what he wants, and not clear he knows exactly what he's looking for, and when he finally picks up a young man in a military uniform, the young man's growing apprehension mirrors our own.  What kind of job demands such secrecy?  Of course, if you've read the back of the dvd case, you know what he wants is for someone to assist him with suicide.  More precisely, he wants someone to come and bury him when the job has been done.  A paradox of the film is that in order to die alone, to leave behind no trace, this man requires an assistant.  He cannot end his life alone.  What is intriguing about the opening scene is that it sets up the uneasy soldier as a kind of surrogate for the audience, who will witness and assess this man's decision to end his life.  It raises questions for us, not only about the significance of life and what considerations might lead one to end it, but also about what it means to be a witness, what it means to observe a man's life, questions that will be intensified as the story progresses.The film is deceptively simple, following the man as he attempts to convince someone, but not just anyone, to perform this final act, to cover him with dirt when he is gone.  It turns out, upon reflection, to have been structured with a great deal of precision, with two major parts divided by a transition during which the man stops to observe the workings of a nearby gravel site.  The digging of the earth, the anonymous machines hauling gravel and soil, all serve as subtle reminders of the burial contemplated by the man.  There is a powerful moment, as the man looks over the edge of a pit where dirt falls, and it seems as though his shadow is shrouded by the soil and silt.  He sits as the mounting dust obscures him from view, and a man comes and calls to him, in a manner that anticipates what he asks his prospective helpers to do, to call his name and be sure he is dead before burying him.  The three men he solicits as assistants are at different stages in their lives, and may suggest different generations and walks of life in Iran - they also seem to represent three very different perspectives on the theme of the film, on the question whether and why life should be lived at all costs: the perspective of the youth and of the military establishment, where law is decisive; the perspective of religion from a cleric in training, where morality and faith are called upon, and judgment is passed; and the perspective of a wise and aging taxidermist, who does not judge but only asks that the man stop and consider whether there is anything he values and could live for.  In his case, when he had himself contemplated his own end, it had been ""the taste of cherries"" that awakened him to feel and care again.The final scene is both enigmatic and rich, and recalls Kiarostami's deliberate tendency in films such asClose-Upto withdraw from key moments and allow viewers to fill in the gaps, allowing the enigma to intensify the imaginative response.  The exuberant and upbeat ending, in contrast with the style and feel of the film to that point, also points back to the beginning, opening space for reflection on the cinematic techniques and themes of the film as a whole, and manages to introduce new concerns such as the nature of cinema, of realism and fiction.  I have seen this film many times and see more each time.  Rather than make it seem more complicated, it gets simpler, more direct, with each new insight.  This is one of the great works of cinema, by one of the most intriguing of living filmmakers.

The pace of the film starts slow and continues on like that  to the end.  It was the endless driving around in a car by the main character that compelled me to watch and understand what is this man trully looking for.  And then, it becomes obvious that he is exhausted from living; there is something in this man's life that has effected him so much that he is unable to go on.In his quest to find someone to bury him, character comes across several men: young soldier, garbage collector, security guard and a young seminary man.  None of them are willing to help him out with his wishes in spite of the fact that they all need money.  It is the moral code of their faith and their personality to prevents them to participate in such act. Until finally a man comes along who is willing to complete the task.  However, he gives his best shot to change the mind of the unfortunate man by telling simple stories about what is it that makes life worth living.This is a philosophical movie and it is not meant for suprficial souls.  This film is for sophisticates open to the ideas about life and death, man's free will to choose and moral code of helping a person who is in some much grief, sadness and despair that they are unable to reflect on the world around them, life they lead and people in it.

461258,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6305362688,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","A Taste of Cherry (Abbas Kiarostami, 1997)Given everything I've read about Abbas Kiarostami's methods of filmmaking, I had come to the (obviously, in hindsight) erroneous conclusion that A Taste of Cherry was going to put me in mind of Bela Tarr or the French New Wave; that is certainly not the case. If any of you who obsessively read film criticism have been staying away from Kiarostami because it sounds, when people talk about his stuff, like it's not really about anything, let me lay that specter to rest right now. A Taste of Cherry is most definitely about something.Mr. Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) is the central character, and for the first twenty minutes or so of the movie, we follow him around while he tries to get someone to do something for him. We don't know what, and the dialogue cleverly conceals it-- is Badii a homosexual looking for a tryst? (Given the ubiquity of this interpretation, I'm assuming that was Kiarostami's intention.) Eventually, however, we find out (and this isn't a spoiler, as it's in the box copy) Mr. Badii wants to kill himself, and he's looking for someone to come make sure he's done the job properly the next morning. We keep following him, but now the film has taken on an entirely new quality, given that we know what he's after; the other ends of the conversations suddenly make a great deal more sense.I'm not familiar enough with Iranian culture to grasp the cultural allegories I'm sure run through this movie, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying the story for the story's sake. Essentially, it's a feature-length discussion about the value of life, and whether one man's valuation of life is as valid as any other man's. Kiarostami pulls it off because Ershadi is completely believable in his role, and so is everyone with whom he comes in contact (I often felt the minor characters weren't actors at all, and that Ershadi had simply driven up to them and started talking in order to get reactions).

461259,A2N46J4SPXJ09U,6305362688,Robert Stribley,"[46, 51]","If you're going to make a film which largely consists of a man driving his Range Rover along dusty Iranian roads, soliciting various men for their assistance, you'd sure better make an engaging film. For the  philosophically inclined, Abbas Kiarostami has done just that.Though  most of the film takes place on a few dirt roads over-looking Tehran, you  could still see it as a road movie, albeit a sophisticated, intellectually  engaging one.Homayon Ershadi plays Badii, the driver of the Range Rover,  as a strong yet depleted man, a man with resignation etched into his face  in every frame. Mr. Badii is trying to find someone to help him with his  suicide. The job is simple: come to cover his body if he's successful;  rescue him if he is not. He's willing to give a tremendous amount of money  for only a little work. Each man he picks up reacts to his offer in a  different way--each of them conveys the belief that Badii's taking his own  life would be wrong, but each of them gives different a reason for his  inability to help. The only man willing to help Badii is another who once  attempted suicide.  Even he tries to convince him to remain, to remember  the taste of cherry.The end of the movie has been misunderstood by some  reviewers; it's not a trick, the movie is not a sham. The ending simply  provides a jolting coda, reminding us that no matter how barren life may  seem, there is a reality uncolored by emotion and mental disease, and in  that reality there are others leading joyful lives.Not only has  Kiarostami given us food for thought, he reveals gritty, dusty Tehran to be  a city of haunting golden beauty.  Another filmaker would have taken us to  Eden to prove his point, but Kiarostami shows us there is beauty wherever  you are, even in a land seemingly drained of color and steeped in binding  tradition.",4,A taste to be savored,950400000,"02 13, 2000",2000,1841,"[""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'film', 'largely', 'man', 'driving', 'Range', 'Rover', 'dusty', 'Iranian', 'roads', 'soliciting', 'various', 'men', 'assistance', ""'d"", 'sure', 'better', 'make', 'engaging', 'film', 'philosophically', 'inclined', 'Abbas', 'Kiarostami', 'done', 'just', 'most', 'film', 'place', 'few', 'dirt', 'roads', 'over-looking', 'Tehran', 'could', 'still', 'see', 'road', 'movie', 'sophisticated', 'intellectually', 'engaging', 'Ershadi', 'Badii', 'driver', 'Range', 'Rover', 'strong', 'yet', 'depleted', 'man', 'man', 'resignation', 'etched', 'face', 'frame', 'Mr.', 'Badii', 'trying', 'find', 'someone', 'help', 'suicide', 'job', 'simple', 'come', 'cover', 'body', 'successful', 'not', 'willing', 'give', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'money', 'only', 'little', 'work', 'man', 'up', 'reacts', 'offer', 'different', 'way', 'conveys', 'belief', 'Badii', 'taking', 'own', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'different', 'reason', 'inability', 'help', 'only', 'man', 'willing', 'help', 'Badii', 'who', 'once', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'Even', 'convince', 'remain', 'remember', 'taste', 'cherry.The', 'end', 'movie', 'been', 'misunderstood', 'reviewers', 'not', 'trick', 'movie', 'not', 'sham', 'ending', 'simply', 'jolting', 'coda', 'reminding', 'matter', 'how', 'barren', 'life', 'may', 'seem', 'reality', 'uncolored', 'emotion', 'mental', 'disease', 'reality', 'are', 'others', 'leading', 'joyful', 'lives.Not', 'only', 'Kiarostami', 'given', 'food', 'thought', 'gritty', 'dusty', 'Tehran', 'be', 'city', 'haunting', 'golden', 'beauty', 'filmaker', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'Eden', 'prove', 'point', 'Kiarostami', 'beauty', 'are', 'even', 'land', 'seemingly', 'drained', 'color', 'steeped', 'binding', 'tradition']",Taste of Cherry

Mr.Badii  doesn't want to live anymore and he is asking people to bury his body after he commits suicide. Most people don't want to make a deal and finally one guy accepts it. The people reaction ranges from being scared to trying to change Mr.Badii's mind and convince him to stay alive.Obviously, the author was not the first one who brought up these questions. So the content is not a big surprise. But the form! It's  really something interesting.First off, there are not too many Iranian movies around. Second, it's a very different culture. Third, it's a nice slow movie with plenty of time to think. There are a lot small tricks. E.g. the most of the film is really slow moving and you get used to that rythm. And all the sudden the final few events just fly by. I don't speak farsi but it's interesting to look at the faces when the characters are talking about the life and death questions. Sometimes it's not what you'd expect to see.So watching this movie is something similar to visiting a museum. Relax, watch and think. Pay attention to the details.
