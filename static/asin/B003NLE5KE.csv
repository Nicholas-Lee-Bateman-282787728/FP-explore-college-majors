1355664,A3K8JS5ZZL3GGF,B003NLE5KE,Amazon Customer,"[3, 9]","This is not a full Review but a description of the item as it was not orginallyb listed.I have watched a few episodes of this show and liked it. Found it to be funny. I waiting for this in Englih because my son is very interested in watching.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:Princess Resurrection ('''' Kaibutsu 'jo?, lit. Monster Princess) is a supernatural, Horror, Comedy and Action manga by Yasunori Mitsunaga. The manga is serialized monthly in Monthly Sh'nen Sirius magazine and published by Kodansha. An 26 episode anime series by Madhouse aired on TBS in 2007. Both the manga and anime are available in North America with the manga licensed by Del Rey Manga and the anime licensed by Sentai Filmworks and available on the Anime Network website. A new OVA series has been made by Tatsunoko Production with the first episode released in December 2010, along with the 13th volume of the manga and the second episode for the 14th volume.PlotMain article: List of Princess Resurrection charactersHiro Hiyorimi is a boy who has just moved to the city to meet his sister. While walking down the sidewalk, he is suddenly hit by a car (crushed by construction beams in the anime). On the verge of death, he is seen by a young woman clad in gothic clothes. She then resurrects him, leaving him alive in the hospital morgue. He wakes up confused over what happened, only to encounter the woman again as she eliminates some wolf creatures. She addresses Hiro as ""her servant"" and introduces herself as ""Hime"" (Japanese for Princess) and explains that she is a member of the royal family of the Monster Realm.All members of the royal family are endowed with the power to turn a dead body into an immortal warrior that will serve and protect them; this means that a corpse that drinks her blood (or to whom she bestows the flame of immortality in the anime) shall become semi-immortal; this is how Hiro came back to life. They can't be killed, even if their heads are severed; it can be reattached, and appendages can eventually regrow. The ""semi"" means that if Hiro doesn't drink more of Hime's blood (or she replenishes the flame in the anime) every few days, he will die permanentlyHiro is now Hime's immortal warrior, but she herself isn't immortal yet (which is why she needs help from warriors). The story then follows Hiro as he assists Hime in killing creatures that have been sent by her siblings to attack her in the competition for the Monster Kingdom's throne.AnimeA 26 episode anime directed by Masayuki Sakoi and Madhouse aired on TBS, BS-i, KBS Kyoto and its affiliated TV networks from 13 April 2007 to 28 September 2007. Unlike the manga, the anime is less violent and the gore has been toned down. The Opening Theme song was ""BLOOD QUEEN"" by Aki Misato and the Ending Theme song was ""Bow Down and Lick My Feet"" ('''''''', hizamazuite ashi wo oname) by Ali Project. The official soundtrack of the anime series is Princess Resurrection OST - Sympathy for the Belonephobia, that is released on October 3, 2007.",5,Description,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,3024,"['not', 'full', 'Review', 'description', 'item', 'was', 'not', 'orginallyb', 'listed.I', 'have', 'watched', 'few', 'episodes', 'show', 'liked', 'Found', 'be', 'funny', 'waiting', 'Englih', 'son', 'very', 'interested', 'watching.From', 'Wikipedia', 'free', 'encyclopedia', 'Princess', 'Resurrection', 'Kaibutsu', 'lit', 'Monster', 'Princess', 'supernatural', 'Horror', 'Comedy', 'Action', 'manga', 'Yasunori', 'Mitsunaga', 'manga', 'serialized', 'monthly', 'Monthly', ""Sh'nen"", 'Sirius', 'magazine', 'published', 'Kodansha', '26', 'episode', 'anime', 'series', 'Madhouse', 'aired', 'TBS', '2007', 'manga', 'anime', 'are', 'available', 'North', 'America', 'manga', 'licensed', 'Del', 'Rey', 'Manga', 'anime', 'licensed', 'Sentai', 'Filmworks', 'available', 'Anime', 'Network', 'website', 'new', 'OVA', 'series', 'been', 'made', 'Tatsunoko', 'Production', 'first', 'episode', 'released', 'December', '2010', '13th', 'volume', 'manga', 'second', 'episode', '14th', 'volume.PlotMain', 'article', 'List', 'Princess', 'Resurrection', 'charactersHiro', 'Hiyorimi', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'moved', 'city', 'meet', 'sister', 'walking', 'down', 'sidewalk', 'suddenly', 'hit', 'car', 'crushed', 'construction', 'beams', 'anime', 'verge', 'death', 'seen', 'young', 'woman', 'clad', 'gothic', 'clothes', 'then', 'leaving', 'alive', 'hospital', 'morgue', 'up', 'confused', 'what', 'happened', 'only', 'encounter', 'woman', 'again', 'wolf', 'creatures', 'Hiro', 'servant', 'Hime', 'Japanese', 'Princess', 'member', 'royal', 'family', 'Monster', 'Realm.All', 'members', 'royal', 'family', 'are', 'endowed', 'power', 'turn', 'dead', 'body', 'immortal', 'warrior', 'will', 'serve', 'protect', 'corpse', 'blood', 'whom', 'flame', 'immortality', 'anime', 'shall', 'become', 'semi-immortal', 'how', 'Hiro', 'came', 'back', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'killed', 'even', 'heads', 'are', 'severed', 'can', 'be', 'reattached', 'appendages', 'can', 'eventually', 'regrow', 'semi', 'Hiro', ""n't"", 'drink', 'more', 'Hime', 'blood', 'flame', 'anime', 'few', 'days', 'will', 'die', 'permanentlyHiro', 'now', 'Hime', 'immortal', 'warrior', ""n't"", 'immortal', 'yet', 'why', 'help', 'warriors', 'story', 'then', 'Hiro', 'Hime', 'killing', 'creatures', 'have', 'been', 'sent', 'siblings', 'attack', 'competition', 'Monster', 'Kingdom', 'throne.AnimeA', '26', 'episode', 'anime', 'directed', 'Masayuki', 'Sakoi', 'Madhouse', 'aired', 'TBS', 'BS-i', 'KBS', 'Kyoto', 'affiliated', 'TV', 'networks', '13', 'April', '2007', '28', 'September', '2007', 'manga', 'anime', 'less', 'violent', 'gore', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'Opening', 'Theme', 'song', 'was', 'BLOOD', 'QUEEN', 'Aki', 'Misato', 'Ending', 'Theme', 'song', 'was', 'Bow', 'Down', 'Lick', 'My', 'Feet', 'hizamazuite', 'ashi', 'wo', 'oname', 'Ali', 'Project', 'official', 'soundtrack', 'anime', 'series', 'Princess', 'Resurrection', 'OST', 'Sympathy', 'Belonephobia', 'released', 'October', '3', '2007']",N/A

1355667,A21IFUGVOAMTRD,B003NLE5KE,DvtDude,"[1, 1]","First off let me start this off by saying I have not read any of the manga for this series so I can't compare the two at all. All i can tell you is about the anime itself.Well without any serious spoilers, (everything I am about to say happens in episode one.) We meet a boy named Hiro who seems like you're every day guy until he suddenly dies from being impaled by a steel beam. Oh did I mention he pushed the princess of the series out of the way, yeah that's important. Anyway Hiro saves her life by pushing her out of the way and he dies. The Princess (Hime) Brings him back to life as her royal servant with an ability known as the flame of life. This grants Hiro immortality as long as Hime is around, which binds the two together, master and servant.From there each episode is more or less a stand alone, some sort of creature or monster is after Hime for the power she has and through all this we have to see Hiro and his friends do the best job they can to protect her. There is a major plot spread out throughout the series but it doesn't really go into major detail in it until the last few episodes which I found a little disappointing.Throughout the story you're going to meet a cast of wonderful characters each with their own unique personality. All the way from a werewolf to a vampire it's very fun and entertaining to watch these characters interact with each other, the dialogue is fantastic and so is the development of the characters. In many of the shows I watch I don't really care what always happens to the characters, I am more along for the plot, but in this series I truly found myself caring what happened to them.It's a great series to get into and I don't think you will be disappointed. The only issue I had with it, which I mentioned above, is the lack of serious moving plot until the very end, other than that the series is great.One thing I must note, there are 26 episodes in the series, but the last two almost feel like fillers, they don't really go with the pace of the show. When you reach episode 24 it feels the series is over and it ends on a strong note, and sort of a cliff hanger. But then you have two episodes left which really have nothing to do with the plot.If you are a fan of demons, werewolf, vampires, and just the underworld in general, don't let this one slip by.",4,"Clever, Witty, and Charming.",1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,2322,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'manga', 'series', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'i', 'can', 'tell', 'anime', 'itself.Well', 'serious', 'spoilers', 'everything', 'am', 'say', 'happens', 'one', 'meet', 'boy', 'named', 'Hiro', 'who', ""'re"", 'day', 'guy', 'suddenly', 'being', 'impaled', 'steel', 'beam', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'pushed', 'princess', 'series', 'way', 'yeah', 'important', 'Anyway', 'Hiro', 'life', 'pushing', 'out', 'way', 'Princess', 'Hime', 'back', 'life', 'royal', 'servant', 'ability', 'known', 'flame', 'life', 'grants', 'Hiro', 'immortality', 'as', 'long', 'Hime', 'two', 'together', 'master', 'servant.From', 'there', 'episode', 'more', 'less', 'stand', 'alone', 'sort', 'creature', 'monster', 'Hime', 'power', 'have', 'see', 'Hiro', 'friends', 'do', 'best', 'job', 'can', 'protect', 'major', 'plot', 'spread', 'series', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'major', 'detail', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'found', 'little', 'story', ""'re"", 'going', 'meet', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'own', 'unique', 'personality', 'way', 'werewolf', 'vampire', 'very', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'characters', 'interact', 'other', 'dialogue', 'fantastic', 'so', 'development', 'characters', 'many', 'shows', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'always', 'characters', 'am', 'more', 'plot', 'series', 'truly', 'found', 'caring', 'what', 'happened', 'them.It', 'great', 'series', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'only', 'issue', 'had', 'mentioned', 'lack', 'serious', 'moving', 'plot', 'very', 'end', 'other', 'series', 'great.One', 'thing', 'must', 'note', 'are', '26', 'episodes', 'series', 'last', 'two', 'almost', 'feel', 'fillers', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'pace', 'show', 'When', 'reach', 'episode', '24', 'feels', 'series', 'strong', 'note', 'sort', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'then', 'have', 'two', 'episodes', 'left', 'really', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'plot.If', 'are', 'fan', 'demons', 'werewolf', 'vampires', 'just', 'underworld', 'general', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'one', 'slip']",N/A
1355668,A3K4PY8LFVW6VU,B003NLE5KE,George Kelly Th,"[1, 3]","I will say wasnt really sure what to expect when i got this series since i didnt check it out on the web before i purchased it. It just sounded like something i would like so got it and hafta say its 1 of the best series for its guandra. It does start off a bit slow but by time u get a few episodes into the series it really picks up and once all the major players are intrduced it really gets good.Yes this is a stand alone episode series wich i personaly tend to like hate it when they wanna drag a series out for 15 or 20 years like what they did with Bleach.Also i will add it does have a english DUB wich i was worried abouot cause after i started checkin out some other sites they were saying it needed dub and wasnt in english. By the way i reconised most of the english voice actores/actresses and they did a excelant job. Hell Monica Rai ( wich is one of my favs) was 1 of the actresses so if your familar with her work u no what to expect.Also at the end of the series it just doesnt leave u hanging they do a good job of tieing things up with with the main antaganist and our group. They also left it so they could continue with the series if the wanted to make a season 2 (  heres hopeing for that one day)So if u like shows like Hellsing, Trinity Blood, Black Bloodbrothers ect u will most likely enjoy this series. Its not as violent as Hellsing ect but has a very good story and chars that ya really can get into and start likeing. Also love the constant bickering between Liza or Risa as the japs say and Rei Rei its halarious. I kinda felt more sorry for Liza than any one else since everyone rips on her and treats her like she a dog only because she half werewolf. So if u like shows like this or Night Gallery/Twilight Zone try this out u wont be disapointed. Oh by the way this series is set up the was Night Gallery/Twilight Zone was made so if your familar with those 2 shows u will no what to expect from this.If u like all the classic monsters from western culture then by all means check this out you wont be sorry.

1355669,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B003NLE5KE,Graves,"[7, 9]","Resurrection Princess starts  off with Hiro, an orphaned Junior high student who is going to live with his sister who has just gotten a job as the cook in a mansion owned by the mysterious Hime. Hiro saves Hime from a fatal street accident but is himself killed, and learns that she has the ability to bring him back to life, making him immortal so long as he serves her and she occasionally rejuvenates the flame of life within him.Hime is a daughter of the king of the occult monsters, and currently on the losing end of a dynastic struggle and trying to rebuild her power base by hiding among humans. As such she is the subject of attack by various types of monsters who want to either control her or gain favor with one of her siblings by finally removing her from the game.As  the  series evolves others are added to the household, Lisa Wildman, a quick tempered half werewolf and Reirei, a vampire who originally is one of those with plans for Hime but who seems to become a friend too, but since you're never quite sure where her loyalties lie she becomes one of the most interesting anime characters to pop up in a long time. Hime is herself no shrinking violet but a princess quite happy to charge into battle swinging a sword or a chainsaw.To look at this is a pretty standard anime with a somewhat novel twist. The caste builds up over time which has a nicer feel then just having them all presented at once. Hiro is still nicely freaked out by the fact he keeps running into monsters and his sister, busty, dumb fan service, is oblivious to the fact she is sharing a house with creatures of the night, something that become quite funny after a while. Hiro is very nearly the only male character in the series and the only major male character, surrounded by very powerful strong willed women, all of whom seem politely amused by him.I originally saw this in Japanese with subtitles and liked it a lot that way, so much so I was tempted to buy it then. Now available in English it is even more approachable to an audience that might not want to read subtitles, but give those japanese language files a try as well. Weirdly I like some parts better in Japanese though Lisa Wildman saying her name a LEEZAH sort of annoyed me the Japanese voiced Reirei had a playful condescension whose subtlety was lost in the English language version.

She sends him a letter inviting him to come stay with her. She has a new job as caretaker of a mansion. The mansion is the home of the Princess, Hime. She is an immortal that has the power to grant partial immortality to those who have died. On his way to the mansion, Hiro saves Hime from being crushed by steel beams. He is killed, but Hime brings him back to life and employs him as her servant. Living with a royal princess that is also an immortal, a super gorgeous yet clueless sister, a sexy vampire, a go for broke werewolf babe, and Hime's clingy little sister with a stuck up crush on him; life for Hiro is gonna be crazy. It's a good thing he's immortal now; cause he would be dead 100 times over by the end of the story.This anime is fun, funny, and light hearted. There is a good mix of comedy, action, and drama. The problem with this show is that it doesn't really develop a serious story. Anime doesn't need a serious story to be extremely entertaining, but to make up for not being serious, it needs to be very funny or fast paced.

So while this was a reorder of a product I already have for the price it was going for I felt it was worth getting again.  I would be unsure of this product if I didn't know who the dubbed cast, but having heard them from a many previous animes I knew they were all very talented.  The set itself is pretty much what the earlier releases from Sentai Filmworks were like, you had the series dvd's stacked on top of each other onto a single spindle inside the dvd case.  While this is annoying it didn't cause damage to the disc but still I'd advise getting a new multi-disc case for the series regardless.

1355681,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B003NLE5KE,trashcanman,"[14, 18]","""Princess Resurrection"" is an anime that I found surprisingly engrossing considering it has been completely unheralded. I ran into it by coincidence while searching for obscure vampire titles and it was just about love at first sight.  For a show that seems to utilize nearly every anime convention imaginable, this one still manages to feel fresh by combining elements from all sorts of genres within the genre. The primary setting for the show is classic horror with broad swaths of comedy and it reminds me a lot of Buffy The Vampire Slayer in it's approach. It's got the ""monster of the week"", a metric ton of homages for classic horror/sci-fi fans (including, of course, the Lovecraft incantation I used for the title of this review), recognizable archetypes that are allowed to revel in their roles to the point of parody, and a pretty bizarre sense of humor to tie it all together. This may not have gone over big with the masses, but it feels like it was made with me in mind.Every good anime (or any work of fiction, really) thrives one one thing above all else: characters. ""Princess Resurrection"" is a show that is acutely aware of this fact. While the limited cast of the first few episodes leads to a slow start, Princess Hime of the Monster Kingdom soon begins building her femme fatale dream team of supernatural servants and allies and ends up with the usual ragtag group of lovably caustic personalities interacting with each other. Hime herself is a mythological creature, but revealing which one is a spoiler although you will likely smack yourself in the head for not realizing it sooner once it's revealed. She has the ability to resurrect the dead to be her faithful servants using her Flame of Life. It is the fate of all potential royal heirs to do away with each of their siblings before one can ascend to the throne and although our heroine has no interest in becoming Queen, she still lives under constant covert attack from members of her family. Her haughty reptilian gaze and cold mannerisms hide a kind and merciful woman with a passion for medieval weaponry, chainsaws, and general carnage. Flandre is her robotic pint-sized guardian who speaks only using the word ""huga"" and looks more then a little funny in her little maid outfit with her mouth wide open in a perpetually surprised expression. Hiro is an unlucky boy granted the Flame of Life who becomes the first new subject drafted into Hime's service. He requires her Flame regularly to maintain his immortality and is immune to death so long as he receives it. Maybe he would have been better off dead when the alternative is eternal abuse at the hands of a harem of ill-tempered female supernatural creatures.Along the way two more primary characters show up to make the show really cook. First, Liza, the half-werewolf who can only semi-transform (usually her arms), but makes up for it with pure fighting spirit. She's the typical tomboyish loudmouth character. For contrast, the vampire high school idol Reiri comes in initially to drink Hime's blood. But being defeated, she withdraws but remains a part of their lives for the show's duration. Her capricious and demure mannerisms coupled with her scorching wit make her the most entertaining character by far. It doesn't hurt that she seems to have her own agenda as well. Whether she seeks friendship, another shot at Hime's blood, romance with Hiro (or Hime), just wants to be entertained by the struggles and antics, or all of the above is not really made concrete for most for the show and I like it like that. Plus, any vampire that actually lives in an abandoned church is just damn cool. It's also worth noting that Liza and Reiri HATE each other with the vamp typically getting the better of their exchanges. There are many more characters, but this is the primary cast.Okay. Characters: check. What else is there to love? I haven't even gotten started. Mermen, mummies, shapeshifters, an invisible man, spider-bats, triffids, headless horseman, the entire vampire race, a slasher film reject, a ghost ship, a vain witch with an unhinged laugh and goblin servants, an inept tanuki vampire hunter, a catgirl assassin, and some original surprises are just a few of the foes to be taken on before the anime's premature conclusion. Hiro will be pierced, slashed, hit by vehicles, drowned, and vamped among many other demises along the way. He's like an anime Kenny from South Park. Oh yes, and the satire. While ""Princess Resurrection"" utilizes several standard anime devices, it occasionally takes the time to mock itself and it's own fans. One character happens upon the lead character combo and politely inquires what kind of cosplay they are doing. That is some funny stuff. Taking the premise even further, they stage an episode where a group of Hiro's classmates invade the mansion (word to the wise; stay away from the creepy mansion at the top of the hill with a constant vortex of clouds over it) and each fall head-over-heels for their favorite anime-girl fantasy. One goes ga-ga for Hiro's ridiculously chesty and naive sister -who works as Hime's live in maid- and constantly makes groping gestures and repeats ""squishy squishy"". Another admires the Amazonian warrior type and falls for Liza. The third is a shameless masochist who wishes to be dominated and treated poorly by the princess herself, who stomps on his face and then demands Flandre bring her a new unsoiled pair of shoes. It's his dream come true. Thankfully, Reiri wasn't around so I didn't have to suffer an animated version of me making girlish ""squee!"" noises every time the vampire girl was onscreen. They also missed a chance for more laughs by neglecting to point out that Hime's little sister, Sherwood, is the classic loli archetype, which is disturbingly popular among otaku. But then again this particular anime's only real weakness is that it often seems to pull punches on anything potentially offensive, which is both too bad and very odd considering the brazenly salacious closing credits. Speaking of which: the opening and closing credits are both very entertaining and amusing in and of themselves.Now, this show was well on it's way to five star status before the climax. But when Hime's elder brother unleashed the ultimate biological weapon known to horror fans upon her town (and if you don't know what that is, shame on you!), the show closed the deal. But on top of that, there are two bonus standalone episodes that I wish they had put sequentially before the climax because after building up and concluding the story arc that impressively, ending with a few throwaway eps -although very entertaining ones- kind of dampened the ending a bit. Still, this is a show I've enjoyed more then almost any anime in recent memory (and that is a lot of anime). This definitely turned out to be a big sleeper hit for me. Sadly, getting a second season of a show like this one is even less dependable in Japan then it is in America so it appears ""Princess Resurrection"" is doomed to be incomplete as an anime story. But then again, with animated series, there is always hope of it being picked up again down the line. And there's always the manga if you aren't retarded like me and get a headache reading right-to-left. Check this series out if you're a horror fanatic and pray with me for another season.",5,"""That is not dead which can eternal lie.
