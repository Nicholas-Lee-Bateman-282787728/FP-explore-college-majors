1598,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,0563412879,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[5, 5]","Phillip Ashley's cousin and guardian has died in Florence in mysterious circumstances. A life-long bachelor, he married some months before his death. Mysterious letters insinuating that his wife is somehow responsible for his death arrive too late for Phillip to do anything except travel to Florence in time to find Ambrose dead and the mysterious wife Rachel gone. But all is not clear as Ambrose may have had a brain tumor that accounts for his strange preoccupations, the doctors certainly believe so.Not to worry, Rachel is on her way to Cornwall to see Phillip and they finally meet in his ancestral home, a home he doesn't inherit until his twenty-fifth brithday. Phillip falls under the spell of the beautiful and charming Rachel. So much so that he transfers the estate to Rachel, believing that this is what Ambrose would have wanted. Once the estate is hers, Rachel begins behaving very differently towards Phillip, who becomes ill and paranoid in his turn. Is Rachel a conniving adventuress and murderess or is she an unlucky woman who brings tragedy in her wake? As in the novel, the answer remains ambiguous. Based on the classic novel by du Maurier and featuring wonderful performances by de Havilland and Burton this is a minor classic of the silver screen and not to be missed.

My take is that Rachel is so much a child of her particular European culture, being so adverse to the English mindset, that she appears more of an exploiter than she actually is.

1615,A106016KSI0YQ,0563412879,Jay Dickson,"[7, 7]","Daphne du Maurier used this phrase to speak of both of her most famous novels, REBECCA and MY COUSIN RACHEL, which have frequently been compared. They both feature Cornish seaside ancestral homes, and they both explore confusing erotic triangles involving the dead and the living. Fittingly, both novels were turned into great Hollywood Gothic films; though the film of REBECCA is one of the most famous of all films from Hollywood's Golden Age, MY COUSIN RACHEL is far less well known today, although it is as powerful and may even be as great. Like REBECCA, it also features an unforgettable score by Franz Waxman (which can be beautifully isolated on this Twilight Time limited edition DVD), and great costumes, set design, and especially cinematography. The parallels seem to have struck the studio too, since Twentieth-Century Fox cast Olivia de Havilland, the sister of Joan Fontaine (the lead in Paramount's REBECCA), in the title role, and in the male lead, instead of Laurence Olivier (the Max de Winter of the 1940 Hitchcock film), Richard Burton, who in his debut film performance here very much recalls Olivier.Why the film is not better known today is hard to say, and may have something to do with its setting in the very early Victorian period: certainly this was not the most attractive era for women's fashions, and De Havilland's hairstyle in her early scenes (in braids coiled round her ears, like Princess Leia) could not flatter anyone. But when her hair is brought down later in the film she shows herself as still one of the greatest beauties of Hollywood's Golden Age, and her intensity and fine Method training in the Forties serve her in excellent stead too. Originally Fox was said to have wanted Vivien Leigh for the role of Rachel Sangeletti, and though she certainly would have given a more carnal performance than De Havilland (whose exquisite diction is perhaps not put to its best use as the sensual Rachel), she could not have played the role with more intelligence--always De Havilland's best asset as a mature actress. As Philip, the nephew of Rachel's first husband (and like the elder man Rachel's cousin), Burton sometimes recalls Olivier's worst tendencies, such as his habit of speaking too quickly and loudly when he's angry, such that Burton's explosive scene in the church with Audrey Dalton is overdone. But he is here at his most beautiful, and he exhibits an almost palpable passion before De Havilland (reportedly the two did not get along, which may have given heat to their many scenes together).The film's greatest asset, however is Nunnelly Johnson's relative fidelity to Du Maurier's beautifully constructed story. Was Rachel innocent, or was she guilty? MY COUSIN RACHEL is ambiguous in ways even REBECCA was not, and dares to suggest that this key question may ultimately unanswerable. Philip believes Rachel has murdered his cousin, but like his cousin becomes so besotted by her he cannot refuse her anything--his money, his family's jewels, even his own hand in marriage... which the wily Rachel is of course far too canny to accept. Twilight Time made only 3000 copies of this DVD edition, and it is absolutely worth buying. This is one of the forgotten treasures of the Hollywood studio era.",5,"""A study in jealousy""",1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,3251,"['Daphne', 'du', 'Maurier', 'used', 'phrase', 'speak', 'most', 'famous', 'novels', 'REBECCA', 'MY', 'COUSIN', 'RACHEL', 'have', 'frequently', 'been', 'compared', 'feature', 'Cornish', 'seaside', 'ancestral', 'homes', 'explore', 'confusing', 'erotic', 'triangles', 'involving', 'dead', 'living', 'Fittingly', 'novels', 'were', 'turned', 'great', 'Hollywood', 'Gothic', 'films', 'film', 'REBECCA', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'films', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'MY', 'COUSIN', 'RACHEL', 'far', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'today', 'powerful', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'great', 'REBECCA', 'also', 'unforgettable', 'score', 'Franz', 'Waxman', 'can', 'be', 'beautifully', 'isolated', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'limited', 'edition', 'DVD', 'great', 'costumes', 'set', 'design', 'especially', 'cinematography', 'parallels', 'seem', 'have', 'struck', 'studio', 'too', 'Twentieth-Century', 'Fox', 'cast', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'sister', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'lead', 'Paramount', 'REBECCA', 'title', 'role', 'male', 'lead', 'instead', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Max', 'de', 'Winter', '1940', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'who', 'debut', 'film', 'performance', 'here', 'very', 'much', 'recalls', 'film', 'not', 'better', 'known', 'today', 'hard', 'say', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'setting', 'very', 'early', 'Victorian', 'period', 'certainly', 'was', 'not', 'most', 'attractive', 'era', 'women', 'fashions', 'De', 'Havilland', 'hairstyle', 'early', 'scenes', 'braids', 'coiled', 'round', 'ears', 'Princess', 'Leia', 'could', 'not', 'flatter', 'anyone', 'when', 'hair', 'brought', 'down', 'later', 'film', 'still', 'one', 'greatest', 'beauties', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'intensity', 'fine', 'Method', 'training', 'Forties', 'serve', 'excellent', 'stead', 'too', 'Originally', 'Fox', 'was', 'said', 'have', 'wanted', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'role', 'Rachel', 'Sangeletti', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'carnal', 'performance', 'De', 'Havilland', 'exquisite', 'diction', 'perhaps', 'not', 'put', 'best', 'use', 'sensual', 'Rachel', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'more', 'intelligence', 'always', 'De', 'Havilland', 'best', 'asset', 'mature', 'actress', 'Philip', 'nephew', 'Rachel', 'first', 'husband', 'elder', 'man', 'Rachel', 'cousin', 'Burton', 'sometimes', 'Olivier', 'worst', 'tendencies', 'such', 'habit', 'speaking', 'too', 'quickly', 'loudly', 'when', 'angry', 'such', 'Burton', 'explosive', 'scene', 'church', 'Audrey', 'Dalton', 'overdone', 'here', 'most', 'beautiful', 'almost', 'palpable', 'passion', 'De', 'Havilland', 'reportedly', 'two', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'may', 'have', 'given', 'heat', 'many', 'scenes', 'together', '.The', 'film', 'greatest', 'asset', 'however', 'Nunnelly', 'Johnson', 'relative', 'fidelity', 'Du', 'Maurier', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'story', 'Was', 'Rachel', 'innocent', 'was', 'guilty', 'MY', 'COUSIN', 'RACHEL', 'ambiguous', 'ways', 'even', 'REBECCA', 'was', 'not', 'suggest', 'key', 'question', 'may', 'ultimately', 'unanswerable', 'Philip', 'Rachel', 'murdered', 'cousin', 'cousin', 'so', 'besotted', 'can', 'not', 'refuse', 'anything', 'money', 'family', 'jewels', 'even', 'own', 'hand', 'marriage', 'wily', 'Rachel', 'course', 'far', 'too', 'canny', 'accept', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'made', 'only', '3000', 'copies', 'DVD', 'edition', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'buying', 'one', 'forgotten', 'treasures', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'era']",N/A

1618,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,0563412879,lily t.,"[0, 0]","I have to respectfully disagree with the reviewer who panned this movie on the basis that it is a Gothic melodrama. Just as I could not live on a steady diet of filet mignon or Beef Wellington, I wouldn't care to focus exclusively on great literature and art films. Besides, productions should be judged within their own genre and on their own merits.That said, My Cousin Rachel is a delight. Olivia de Havilland is gorgeous as the eponymous cousin, who may be a fortune hunter, a murderess, a charmingly worldly woman or perhaps a combination of any and all those things. Burton is young, passionate, obsessed, violent, generous, remorseful, suspicious and jealous-- the sort of man one would run from in real life, though by his skill, he makes his character sympathetic.Rachel falls short of being in the same category as Rebecca, simply because Rebecca was directed by the great master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock , who could make a cliff, some ocean spume (and judicious use of music ) appear portentous.I enjoyed every minute of this production.  If you agree, and haven't yet seen the following, I would recommend: The Heiress, with de Havilland and Montgomery Clift - based on Henry James' Washington Square; and Hitchock's Parradine Case, with Alida Valli ( one of the best femmes fatales ever ), Gregory Peck and Louis Jordan.",4,If you loved Rebecca,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,1338,"['have', 'respectfully', 'disagree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'panned', 'movie', 'basis', 'Gothic', 'melodrama', 'Just', 'could', 'not', 'live', 'steady', 'diet', 'filet', 'mignon', 'Beef', 'Wellington', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'focus', 'exclusively', 'great', 'literature', 'art', 'films', 'Besides', 'productions', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'own', 'genre', 'own', 'merits.That', 'said', 'My', 'Cousin', 'Rachel', 'delight', 'Olivia', 'Havilland', 'gorgeous', 'eponymous', 'cousin', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'fortune', 'hunter', 'murderess', 'charmingly', 'worldly', 'woman', 'perhaps', 'combination', 'things', 'Burton', 'young', 'passionate', 'obsessed', 'violent', 'generous', 'remorseful', 'suspicious', 'jealous', 'sort', 'man', 'one', 'would', 'run', 'real', 'life', 'skill', 'character', 'sympathetic.Rachel', 'short', 'being', 'same', 'category', 'Rebecca', 'simply', 'Rebecca', 'was', 'directed', 'great', 'master', 'suspense', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'cliff', 'ocean', 'spume', 'judicious', 'use', 'music', 'appear', 'portentous.I', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'production', 'agree', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'following', 'would', 'recommend', 'Heiress', 'de', 'Havilland', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'based', 'Henry', 'James', 'Washington', 'Square', 'Hitchock', 'Parradine', 'Case', 'Alida', 'Valli', 'one', 'best', 'femmes', 'fatales', 'ever', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Louis', 'Jordan']",N/A

Doyle ""film buff""","[23, 24]","If Gothic romance is your thing, you won't find a more absorbing and intriguing tale than this adaptation of Daphne DuMaurier's best-selling novel, MY COUSIN RACHEL. Not only is the atmosphere completely realized, but the elegant performances make the story even more compelling to watch as it unfolds a tale of possible murder and cunning deceit. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards for best costumes, B&W; cinematography, art decoration and Burton's supporting role performance (which is actually a leading role).RICHARD BURTON cuts a fine figure as the romantic hero of the piece--brooding, intense and passionate, reminding one of Heathcliff in the Bronte novel, ""Wuthering Heights."" He's an angry and impressionable youth who intends to accuse his cousin of murder based on his suspicious nature, but instead falls wildly in love with her the instant they meet.OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND matches Burton scene by scene, her charming manners and poise as a woman of the world understandably provoking his interest. At first, he assumes she wants to claim her inheritance when she visits Cornwall. But soon he is able to see her in a different light and when he falls in love with her, he decides to leave his entire inheritance to her on his 25th birthday. It is then that the story becomes even more compelling when the ambiguous nature of Rachel comes at long last to the surface.Franz Waxman has written a very dramatic and powerful background score that adds dimension to the Gothic tale that begins when a boy and his guardian walk across the moors and come to a gibbet where a man is hanging. ""Always remember, Philip, death is the price for murder."" And that's how the film's brief prologue begins.It's richly scored, well directed by Henry Koster and features two outstanding performances from Olivia de Havilland and Richard Burton. Equally fine are John Sutton as Rachel's ill-fated husband, Audrey Dalton, Ronald Squire and George Dolenz.Despite the ambiguous ending, it's an absorbing tale that is satisfying in its execution. The newly restored DVD includes an isolated ""music score only"" for those fascinated by Franz Waxman's wonderful background score.",5,Great performances from de Havilland and Burton...,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,2175,"['Gothic', 'romance', 'thing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'more', 'absorbing', 'intriguing', 'tale', 'adaptation', 'Daphne', 'DuMaurier', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'MY', 'COUSIN', 'RACHEL', 'Not', 'only', 'atmosphere', 'completely', 'realized', 'elegant', 'performances', 'make', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'compelling', 'watch', 'tale', 'possible', 'murder', 'cunning', 'deceit', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'four', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'best', 'costumes', 'B', 'W', 'cinematography', 'art', 'decoration', 'Burton', 'supporting', 'role', 'performance', 'actually', 'leading', 'role', 'BURTON', 'fine', 'figure', 'romantic', 'hero', 'piece', 'brooding', 'intense', 'passionate', 'reminding', 'one', 'Heathcliff', 'Bronte', 'novel', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'angry', 'impressionable', 'youth', 'who', 'accuse', 'cousin', 'murder', 'based', 'suspicious', 'nature', 'instead', 'wildly', 'love', 'instant', 'meet.OLIVIA', 'DE', 'HAVILLAND', 'Burton', 'scene', 'scene', 'charming', 'manners', 'poise', 'woman', 'world', 'understandably', 'provoking', 'interest', 'first', 'claim', 'inheritance', 'when', 'Cornwall', 'soon', 'able', 'see', 'different', 'light', 'when', 'love', 'leave', 'entire', 'inheritance', '25th', 'birthday', 'then', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'compelling', 'when', 'ambiguous', 'nature', 'Rachel', 'long', 'last', 'surface.Franz', 'Waxman', 'written', 'very', 'dramatic', 'powerful', 'background', 'score', 'dimension', 'Gothic', 'tale', 'when', 'boy', 'guardian', 'walk', 'moors', 'come', 'gibbet', 'where', 'man', 'hanging', 'Always', 'remember', 'Philip', 'death', 'price', 'murder', 'how', 'film', 'brief', 'prologue', 'begins.It', 'richly', 'scored', 'well', 'directed', 'Henry', 'Koster', 'features', 'two', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Equally', 'fine', 'are', 'John', 'Sutton', 'Rachel', 'ill-fated', 'husband', 'Audrey', 'Dalton', 'Ronald', 'Squire', 'George', 'Dolenz.Despite', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'absorbing', 'tale', 'satisfying', 'execution', 'newly', 'restored', 'DVD', 'isolated', 'music', 'score', 'only', 'fascinated', 'Franz', 'Waxman', 'wonderful', 'background', 'score']",N/A

Olivia de Havilland and 23-year-old Richard Burton (in his American film d&eacute;but) star in this moody tale of a rich young man in 1840s Cornwall and his relationship with his foster father's enigmatic widow. When his beloved father figure dies mysteriously on his honeymoon in Italy, Philip Ashley (Burton) inherits his entire estate--and the aforementioned widow (de Havilland). He is expected to ""do the right thing"" and provide for the penniless beauty, so he gallantly invites her to his home. What follows are passion, sexual obsession, greed, cat-and-mouse mind games...and possibly murder.This Twilight Time DVD is a welcome addition to my film library--I've placed it on the shelf right next to Hitchcock'sRebecca. I don't know why the folks at 20th Century Fox don't give RACHEL a DVD release, but until they do, this is the one to have.

It centers on a young Englishman whose older cousin and childhood protector is killed in Italy shortly after he marries ""Rachel"" there.  She is the ""cousin"" Rachel of the title.  The husband of this individual writes letters to his young relative strongly suggesting that Rachel is tormenting and destroying him.The young man finds that he has inherited his male relative's considerable fortune.  Rachel inherits nothing but shows up at her late husband's estate in England behaving very charmingly to the heir.  He is soon 'swept of his feet' by this charm and seeming sweetness and devotion towards him.  He finally is so besotted that he gives all the inheritance away to her, after which there is an immediate cooling off of her ardor for him.He learns that she is a notorious prodigal and morally of ill repute and has reason to suspect her of poisoning him and his brother.  At the 'end' of the tale, however, he starts to wonder if he has misjudged her in some important respects.The ending is covenient for the writer (writers can do whatever they want with their characters); she seems to have just abandoned the story and then peddled it as  a ""psychological thriller"" - making convenience seem 'clever'.
