I watched the original series on the Discovery Channel and would try and catch it every time it replayed in reruns.I must admit that I was very pleasantly surprised  because watching the dvd was like watching the shows new, because of the included material that was not the shows when they ran on television.I actually found out that the A Haunting in Georgia actually takes place north of Columbus, Georgia and I live about 60 miles south of Columbus. When watching it on television, I always figured it was set in North Georgia.  Of the two, I like A Haunting in Connecticut better, but only because it seemed to have better closure.  When I went to see the  movie version, I was not happy, because of the liberties they took with the original and it felt like I was watching a very inferior rip off of the original or possibly, I may have like the movie if I had never seen the original.I hate that they ended the series and I have a pretty good collection of them. I purchased theHaunting of Winchester House (2009)because one of the producers also produced the A-Haunting Series. Don't bother with this movie. It really isn't all that good and I remember seeing the Discovery channel show about the Winchester House and Sara Winchester and the only thing that is the same is the Winchester name. This movie sucks, although it does have some of the episodes from the Fox series Ghost Stories, which are not even close to A Haunting.",5,The Best of the Best,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,1502,"['ordered', 'DVD', 'must', 'admit', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'watched', 'original', 'series', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'would', 'try', 'catch', 'time', 'replayed', 'reruns.I', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'watching', 'dvd', 'was', 'watching', 'shows', 'new', 'included', 'material', 'was', 'not', 'shows', 'when', 'ran', 'television.I', 'actually', 'found', 'A', 'Haunting', 'Georgia', 'actually', 'place', 'north', 'Columbus', 'Georgia', 'live', '60', 'miles', 'south', 'Columbus', 'When', 'watching', 'television', 'always', 'figured', 'was', 'set', 'North', 'Georgia', 'two', 'like', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'better', 'only', 'seemed', 'have', 'better', 'closure', 'When', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'liberties', 'took', 'original', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'very', 'inferior', 'rip', 'original', 'possibly', 'may', 'have', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'original.I', 'hate', 'ended', 'series', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'collection', 'purchased', 'theHaunting', 'Winchester', 'House', '2009', 'one', 'producers', 'also', 'produced', 'A-Haunting', 'Series', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'good', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Discovery', 'channel', 'show', 'Winchester', 'House', 'Sara', 'Winchester', 'only', 'thing', 'same', 'Winchester', 'name', 'movie', 'have', 'episodes', 'Fox', 'series', 'Ghost', 'Stories', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'Haunting']",Haunting: (A Haunting in Georgia / A Haunting in Connecticut)

These are the original two documentaries that premiered on the DIscovery Channel which led to the series entitled ""A Haunting"" (which is available in a 39 episode set composed of Seasons 1-4).  You won't be sorry you bought it.  I have watched each episode at least a dozen times and I still find it entertaining.  You will definitely get your money's worth.  I was practiacally in tears when the series ended.  I guess they ran out of real-life hauntings.

A Haunting in Connecticut is the story that was supposed to be portrayed in the motion picture a couple of years ago. However the movie changed the story. This documentary tells the real story, which is much better. A Haunting in Georgia is just as good, and is a long story. Both of these documentaries are an hour and a half long.

1204988,A1K0LPMMIU2UV6,B001IZNJ2C,S. Moon,"[2, 4]","There were the precursors to the series 'A Haunting', one of my favorite shows.  I never watched these or the series when they were new but my sister found the 'A Haunting' box set  in a store for $15 and bought them for my Dad for Christmas.  I saw the box set on a shelf a few times when visiting but never borrowed it but one Halloween when I was there thought 'what the heck'.  Anyway, added these to my Halloween shows I watch during the month of October and was surprised to find out that there were two movies that inspired this series.These are those movies.  They are presented in the old square aspect ratio so if you have a HDTV they won't look as good as the series.  They are presented in the same manner of the series, very 'Unsolved Mysteries'esk, which I really like.  But these are long, maybe it's because I'm used to the 45 minute episodes of the series, but they drag on a little.  The entire time I thought they could have fit the entire story in 45 minutes, they didn't need the 94 that they use.I'm taking off one stars just because the quality wasn't very good, it was sub par even by DVD standards.  I'm not talking about the aspect ratio but because the video is grainy.  The other star is just because they are so long, it seemed to me that they struggled to make these 94 minutes and drug their feet.  The would have been much better as 45 minutes.",3,Good intro to the 'A Haunted' series,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,1376,"['were', 'precursors', 'series', 'A', 'Haunting', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'never', 'watched', 'series', 'when', 'were', 'new', 'sister', 'found', 'A', 'Haunting', 'box', 'set', 'store', '15', 'bought', 'Dad', 'Christmas', 'saw', 'box', 'set', 'shelf', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'visiting', 'never', 'borrowed', 'one', 'Halloween', 'when', 'was', 'there', 'thought', 'heck', 'Anyway', 'added', 'Halloween', 'watch', 'month', 'October', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'were', 'two', 'movies', 'inspired', 'series.These', 'are', 'movies', 'are', 'presented', 'old', 'square', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'so', 'have', 'HDTV', 'wo', ""n't"", 'look', 'as', 'good', 'series', 'are', 'presented', 'same', 'manner', 'series', 'very', ""'Unsolved"", ""Mysteries'esk"", 'really', 'are', 'long', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'used', '45', 'minute', 'episodes', 'series', 'drag', 'little', 'entire', 'time', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'fit', 'entire', 'story', '45', 'minutes', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', '94', 'use.I', ""'m"", 'taking', 'off', 'one', 'stars', 'just', 'quality', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'was', 'sub', 'par', 'even', 'DVD', 'standards', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'video', 'grainy', 'other', 'star', 'just', 'are', 'so', 'long', 'seemed', 'struggled', 'make', '94', 'minutes', 'drug', 'feet', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', '45', 'minutes']",Haunting: (A Haunting in Georgia / A Haunting in Connecticut)
