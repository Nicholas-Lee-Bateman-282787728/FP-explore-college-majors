877199,A38FBEBCI7TM9,B00076ONUU,H. N. Dohe,"[73, 83]","They totally took out the whole core of what made the original movie tick. Barry Newman's Kowalski is an anti-hero of the first order- an ex-hero-cop who left the force because of all the dirty doings going on. He pops pills to stay awake to make his car deliveries. And he gets to be an icon of ""rebellion against the man"", even though he had no intention of doing so. In this movie, Viggo Mortenson's a family man just making car deliveries. His wife is pregnant and almost due, but he wants to make one last big delivery- of a super white Challenger. Course his wife has complications, and he's in a race to get back home to the hospital. He attracts the attention of local law enforcement due to his wild driving and speeding, and for some reason they decide to make an example of him. At one point one of the officers says, 'why don't we just let him go home, see his wife, and pick him up in a week?'. The same thought runs through the viewers mind, oh, right after the law finds out WHY he's off and running! And WORSE, they give this movie a happy ending!The only redeeming feature is the car shots- especially the supercar shoot-out between the Challenger and a Charger. Which is why I gave it two starsBut this remake has cut all the soul out of the original movie. In the first movie, there's a touch of mysticism (there's a scene where Kowalski drives past himself in a car he just delivered going in the oppostite direction). There's a feeling of hopelessness in Kowalski that explains the ending better. And nobody will ever consider the remake to be a cult classic like the original is.Ladies will enjoy all the shots of Viggo in this movie, I'm sure. And if Kowalski had been played by Jessica Alba I probably would've been kinder in my review.

877200,AKTPQ30CT2GYF,B00076ONUU,"H. R.  Pierce ""Sky Dragons""","[4, 7]","Remaking a film that was a cult classic from the 1970's is not an easy thing to do, and there are a million ways one could screw it up.  For all the things that could have gone wrong or angered fans of the original film, this one did okay.Viggo Mortensen is Kowalski this time around, but this time he has more back-story and a wife waiting at home for him.  The whole plot gets tweaked a bit from the original since it changes the whole purpose of why he is trying to get cross-country in a specific amount of time.  Using a 1970 Dodge Challenger, Kowalski in the 1997 remake of a 1971 classic becomes much more of a cult hero with a heart rather than a cool guy who likes to drive fast.  Doesn't hurt it much, and Jason Priestley is the anti-government DJ who helps stir the fire when Kowalski starts to garner major attention to himself.  This film seems to be almost a vehicle of pop culture for the mid-nineties, with two of its major stars being popular from the series ""90210"" and many references done that spin the anti-government machine that was churning at the time, with many mentionings of Ruby Ridge, Waco, and Oklahoma City.While the original film had its own raw mystique, this one doesn't do to bad despite giving more depth to the main character, which of course leads to more possibilities and unanswered questions.

After years of procrastination, I finally watched the 1997 remake. Please save yourself the aggravation and an hour and a half of your life and don't make the same mistake. (That mistake being the watching not the procrastination.)This made-for-TV remake is cheap trash. It's also overly religious. The writer-director, Charles Robert Carner, is prominent in LA-based religious organizations such as Catholics in Media Associates and Holy Cross Family Ministries, and it shows. While the original film had its share of sixties hangover spiritual mysticism along with doobies and uppers, this remake is a stupid mess of over-the-top religious symbolism: crosses on the walls, crossing on the bodies, Kowalski's conversion, the plot markers--Palm Sunday, Good Friday, Easter. It has also been stripped of any offensive language and behavior. In place of the cult-awesomeness of the original is line after line of horrible writing, spoken horribly. I usually like Viggo a lot but he sleepwalks through this tripe. Keith David shows up for his paycheck, too, with an off-the-shelf government agent character. And Jason Priestley is no Cleavon Little.

Fortunately, I had the foresight to tape it because I have watched it at least ten times since. I am so thrilled that they are finally releasing it on DVD! This Vanishing Point is a ""remake"" of the 1971 feature film by the same name. It stars Viggo Mortensen in the lead role and Jason Priestly as ""the Voice"". I have never seen the original Vanishing Point but I understand that quite a few plot points have been changed in this made-for-TV version. Viggo Mortensen plays (excellently, of course!) Kowalski, a former Army Ranger/race car driver living in Idaho with his pregnant wife. He takes a job transporting a (gorgeous) Dodge Challenger across the country to earn enough money to pay for his wife to have her baby in the hospital. Unfortunately, his wife falls ill and Kowalksi must race against time to be by her side. Of course, the police and federal government are hot on his heels. This movie was made shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing and its views on the government may be a little surprising for a post-9/11 viewing audience. Some of the best parts of Vanishing Point come from the interactions Kowalski has with the various people he meets along his way. Guys, who may be bored with all the close-ups of Viggo Mortensen in a white t-shirt and tight blue jeans, will be pleasantly surprised to see Peta Wilson (of La Femme Nikita fame) speeding around on a motorcycle in a bikini midway through the film. See - there is something for everyone. I would highly recommend Vanishing Point as a fun, sweet, poignant, and interesting movie. Bonus: the swearing is almost non-existent and there is only one scene with a couple (a married couple) in bed and even then they are both covered up.

This remake is a modest piece with rather skimpy production values, choppy flow, and a cornball plot.  How many men do you know would steal a car (which is basically what Kowalski, the protagonist, does with the Hemi Challenger) and flee before cops of every stripe across a third of the country to make sure they were there for their wives' childbirths?On the other hand, it was a hoot to see those magnificent Mopars ripping up the screen again.  Not to mention the put-downs of other makes (I paraphrase): ""Ha!, take that Chevy?  It takes a Mopar to catch a Mopar,"" says the cop as he very implausibly fires up his own Charger to put the collar on Kowalski.There is in this movie a not too subtle zinging of overbearing, stifling law enforcement in America at all levels.  Only the county sheriff in the final blockade scene brings any kind of proportion to the whole matter while chewing out the feds.  Shades of sheriffs' power of old!  ""The Voice,"" which is the nickname for the radio jock who follows and praises Kowalski, is constantly ranting against big government before a background of pictures of Thomas Jefferson, New Hampshire's state motto ""Live Free or Die,"" and the like.  This character could have been played over the top in order to ridicule supposed Aryan rednecks, but wasn't.  Waco and Ruby Ridge reminders pop up now and then.However, as if for balance, the desert encounter with a survivalist and his babe really was absurd.Adjust your expectations and this movie makes adequate viewing, especially if you like big musclecars and a little anti-government rhetoric.
