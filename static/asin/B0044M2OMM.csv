It is okay if you have never purchased the Topper series but a while back I bought  TV Classics  THE ADVENTURES OF TOPPER  for only  $ 3.99  which  has 9 episodes.  Volume 3  only has 3  episodes  and  2 episodes out of the  3 are in the other DVD.  there is a  bonus episode of Joe  Palooka  which I didn't think is very good.  Buy the  ADVENTURES OF TOPPER.  Is is a lot cheaper and a lot better.,2,topper,1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,444,"['purchased', 'Topper', 'Volume', '3', '7.69', 'okay', 'have', 'never', 'purchased', 'Topper', 'series', 'while', 'back', 'bought', 'TV', 'Classics', 'THE', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'TOPPER', 'only', '3.99', '9', 'episodes', 'Volume', '3', 'only', '3', 'episodes', '2', 'episodes', '3', 'are', 'other', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'episode', 'Joe', 'Palooka', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'very', 'good', 'Buy', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'TOPPER', 'lot', 'cheaper', 'lot', 'better']",Topper: Volume Three

As someone else stated this is Only Three episodes - and I'll add full of imperfections and NOT restored, and is in Black & White. There are no 'Bonus' features other than 'Joe Palooka' (also Black & White) - some stupid boxing story about 'Joe' going to Mexico to fight - and NOTHING to do with Topper. This DVD should be like in a discount bin for $2.00. The show itself is pretty good given the time period (1950's?).
