275788,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,6301964225,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[1, 1]","Continuing my streak of viewing old favorites from my childhood, I watched this excellent film again and I still adored it. In this day and age I find it despairing when today's youth is raving about the likes ofHappy Feet (Full Screen Edition),Chicken Little], [[ASIN:B000ROAK2W Meet the Robinsons,Madagascar (Widescreen Edition), as well as others (Just shoot me now!). Films that were absolute garbage (And some of the worst films I've ever seen) and an insult to those of us who were raised on the good films, which include this. This film was vastly underrated, but thankfully has gone down to become a cult classic. I was absolutely furious when I saw the critical response (44% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 5.2 out of 10), and my trust in critics was absolutely destroyed. I will never trust the critics ever again. Oh Don Bluth, where have you gone? Please come out of hiding from wherever you may be and please make films again. Animated films are in desperate need of rescuing.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The film takes place in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1939. Charlie and Itchy are best friends and essentially partners in crime. The film starts off with Itchy breaking Charlie out of the dog pound before his execution for a crime he was framed for. Then the two decide to visit the bar in which Charlie is in business relations with another dog named Carface who is a mobster, who wants to break off business relations with Charlie. So after a night of getting Charlie drunk at Marti Gras, Carface and his group of thugs blindfold Charlie and make him sit at the end of a dock, and then push a car down the dock and kill him. Then Charlie ends up in heaven, where he refuses to be and intends on getting revenge against Carface. So he grabs the watch in heaven that was life watch (A watch that stopped when he died), and winds it backwards and goes back down to Earth, where he shocks Itchy with the news that he's still alive (Since Itchy witnessed the incident of his death, but was too far away to do anything about it). So he and Itchy begin to enact their plan to get back at Carface and start off by spying in Carface's place, where they meet a human prisoner who is a little girl named Anne Marie who is gifted with the ability to talk to animals. So Charlie and Itchy take Anne Marie for their own use in gambling so she can ask animals at different racing events which one will win, and from this earn massive amounts of money, and build their own casino. I won't reveal anything else about the story, but the morals it teaches are friendship and redemption, which is why this film is so phenomenal even in this day and age. Sure this story seems more adult-oriented for a kids film and a G-rating for such a film is baffling (I'd say hard PG-rating). Kids may not understand it so well, but it's still a fantastic film that both adults and kids should watch instead of the garbage mentioned at the beginning of this review.MUSIC: This film has a great musical score as well as some catchy musical tunes. There were a couple of musical scenes that I didn't particularly like which damaged the potential flawless rating, but for the most part, this area is really good.ACTION: This more a story-focused experience more than action, but for a kid's film, it can be pretty violent for a G-rating, especially since it has a mobster/revenge-esque storyline on top of moral teachings of friendship and redemption. This feels more like an experience made for adults, but smart children (Not the ones raised on the animated garbage previously mentioned) should get a good time out of this wonderful film. This film will tear at your heart strings and it does make your care about the characters (Unlike most modern animated films).ACTING: The actors in this film were really good and I have no gripes with their performances. Burt Reynolds played the role of Charlie quite well and he seemed suited quite well for it. Dom DeLuise (R.I.P., your voice will be sorely missed from animated films) was quite funny and entertaining as Itchy. Although I didn't recognize any of the other actors, but they all performed their roles wonderfully.OVERALL: While the film deals with issues such as mob organizations, drinking, gambling, as well as a few innuendos, this is a great film for kids and adults alike. This film also teaches great moral values and it may have emotional effects as well. If you didn't have the pleasure of seeing this superb animated film, then you owe yourself a favor to see it. Forget the critics.THE GOOD: Great storytelling, great acting, great music, great moral teachings, and some more mature themes to appeal to adults.THE BAD: A couple of musical scenes weren't exactly great.",5,A VASTLY UNDERRATED FILM  9.5 OUT OF 10,1254528000,"10 3, 2009",2009,4727,"['Continuing', 'streak', 'viewing', 'old', 'favorites', 'childhood', 'watched', 'excellent', 'film', 'again',

275789,A3CDG6F1JKU0W1,6301964225,Alanna Evans,"[16, 17]","I have not seen the DVD of this movie, but will comment on the movie itself:With a movie based around dogs running a gambling (rat races) and bar joint, it already earns coolness factor among children's fare. As a child of about 9 when this movie was originally released (ten years ago) these references went straight over my head.  Strangely the movie is still entertaining, although slipping a bit into typical heartwarming stuff after the introduction of the little girl into the mix (who is being held by Charlie's - the German Shephard-like lead dog voiced wonderfully by Burt Reynolds - nemesis, Carface because she can talk to animals and thus know who will win the day's race.)Set in New Orleans, the main plot (which the rest is filler really) is Charlie and his partner Itchy return to the joint that Charlie and Carface used to run together (up until Charlie was thrown into the clinker - the dog pound - until Itchy got him out, the great escape is where the movie begins) and under the guise of helping Charlie set up his own place, Carface holds a party at Mardi Gras where Charlie gets a little too sloshed and makes him an easy target for a cleancut murder.  All dogs go to heaven of course despite the fact there's little record of our lead actually doing any good in his earthly canine life, but heaven wasn't good enough for Charlie, he wants revenge, so he steals his watch of life, winds it back up and heads back down for Vengeance upon the ones who has done him wrong.  That's when his life gets entangled with the little orphan girl (called &quot;Squeaker&quot; by him through most of the movie after a rather cute scene which I won't spoil here), who he 'rescues' for 'using' her for his own selfish purposes instead of helping the child realize her dreams, but his coming to care for her in turn ends up leading to his own true salvation.A very 'dark' film, in lighting and sometimes even in story, there's many morals to be found underneath, the biggest being that even imperfect people (or animals) have goodness in their heart, they only have to reach out and open their hearts to find it.  The badguys are truly bad although the lead villan's Chihuahua looking scrapgoat shows a kinder side sometimes, and are played out kind of like mobsters and not too over-the-top.  There are no ridiculous ambitions, simply the doing in of Charlie so that his claim to the business is his void (he'd be dead afterall), which is a refreshing pace from superhero movies.  The voice acting is very good in most cases, and a couple of the songs don't even make adults cringe too much (especially the one in heaven is quite nice).A well done film throughout, which spawned a mediocre sequel and animated series.  However, there's no substitute for the original, which is one of the best animated movies to come out of the 90s period.  Children will love it, and adults will be able to watch it without feeling too ill or out of place, and those that grew up on it, probably still hold it close to their hearts.",4,A childhood favorite,976233600,"12 8, 2000",2000,3023,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'DVD', 'movie', 'will', 'comment', 'movie', 'movie', 'based', 'dogs', 'running', 'gambling', 'rat', 'races', 'bar', 'joint', 'already', 'coolness', 'factor', 'children', 'fare', 'child', 'about', '9', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'references', 'went', 'straight', 'head', 'Strangely', 'movie', 'still', 'entertaining', 'slipping', 'bit', 'typical', 'heartwarming', 'stuff', 'introduction', 'little', 'girl', 'mix', 'who', 'being', 'held', 'Charlie', 'German', 'Shephard-like', 'lead', 'dog', 'voiced', 'wonderfully', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'nemesis', 'Carface', 'can', 'talk', 'animals', 'thus', 'know', 'who', 'will', 'win', 'day', 'race', 'Set', 'New', 'Orleans', 'main', 'plot', 'rest', 'filler', 'really', 'Charlie', 'partner', 'Itchy', 'return', 'joint', 'Charlie', 'Carface', 'used', 'run', 'together', 'up', 'Charlie', 'was', 'thrown', 'clinker', 'dog', 'pound', 'Itchy', 'got', 'out', 'great', 'escape', 'where', 'movie', 'guise', 'helping', 'Charlie', 'set', 'up', 'own', 'place', 'Carface', 'party', 'Mardi', 'Gras', 'where', 'Charlie', 'little', 'too', 'sloshed', 'easy', 'target', 'cleancut', 'murder', 'dogs', 'go', 'heaven', 'course', 'fact', 'little', 'record', 'lead', 'actually', 'doing', 'good', 'earthly', 'canine', 'life', 'heaven', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'Charlie', 'revenge', 'watch', 'life', 'back', 'up', 'heads', 'back', 'down', 'Vengeance', 'ones', 'who', 'done', 'wrong', 'when', 'life', 'entangled', 'little', 'orphan', 'girl', 'called', 'quot', 'Squeaker', 'quot', 'most', 'movie', 'rather', 'cute', 'scene', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here', 'who', ""'using"", 'own', 'selfish', 'purposes', 'instead', 'helping', 'child', 'realize', 'dreams', 'coming', 'care', 'turn', 'up', 'leading', 'own', 'true', 'salvation.A', 'very', ""'dark"", 'film', 'lighting', 'sometimes', 'even', 'story', 'many', 'morals', 'be', 'found', 'underneath', 'biggest', 'being', 'even', 'imperfect', 'people', 'animals', 'have', 'goodness', 'heart', 'only', 'have', 'reach', 'out', 'open', 'hearts', 'find', 'badguys', 'are', 'truly', 'bad', 'lead', 'villan', 'Chihuahua', 'looking', 'scrapgoat', 'kinder', 'side', 'sometimes', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'kind', 'like', 'mobsters', 'not', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'ambitions', 'simply', 'doing', 'Charlie', 'claim', 'business', 'void', ""'d"", 'be', 'dead', 'afterall', 'refreshing', 'pace', 'superhero', 'movies', 'voice', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'cases', 'couple', 'songs', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'adults', 'cringe', 'too', 'much', 'especially', 'one', 'heaven', 'quite', 'nice', '.A', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'spawned', 'mediocre', 'sequel', 'animated', 'series', 'However', 'substitute', 'original', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'movies', 'come', '90s', 'period', 'Children', 'will', 'love', 'adults', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'feeling', 'too', 'ill', 'place', 'grew', 'up', 'probably', 'still', 'hold', 'close', 'hearts']",N/A

Sure I grew up with staples such as Bambi, Beauty and tbe Beast, and The Lion King, but I also recollect being hooked on All Dogs Go to Heaven, An American Tail, and The Land Before Time. Don Bluth's films are tragically overlooked. All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie I still watch and enjoy now that I'm sixteen. It's a story about life and death.

275797,A1BFO0O2FT0O3T,6301964225,"Chancie ""Chance""","[1, 1]","""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" is a movie that's geared at children, but perhaps it shouldn't be.It was a favorite of mine growing up, but I think at my young age, I wasn't able to grasp all of the dark undertones and ideas that were going on, such as Charlie finding himself in Hell during a dream or that Satan had appeared in a scene later on.But despite that, I was still able to enjoy it for what it was.Now, seeing it again about fifteen years later, I still love it but I'm starting to think maybe it isn't so good for kids. I've been shocked by the darkness that's sprinkled throughout it, something I never picked up when I was young. However, this isn't a bad thing and it doesn't ruin the movie. It's just slightly changed my view of it.The story follows German Shepherd (apparently a mix?) named Charlie B. Barkin and his Dachshund friend, Itchy Itchiford. After being busted out of ""jail"" (a dog pound), Charlie tries to reunite with old Pit-Bull friend, Carface, only to be murdered by him after a nice night of partying and celebration. However, Charlie cheats the system and is able to send himself back to Earth after a little trip to heaven. Soon after, they ""rescue"" young Ann-Marie, an orphan girl who can talk to animals. Charlie, being the scheming mutt that he is, promises to help her find a family but only intends to use her ability to make himself and Itchy a fortune.Now, this sounds like a cute movie that's okay for the kids. You get talking dogs, afterall. But it's not what it seems. There are quite a few rather violent scenes and if your child would be smart enough to catch on to the fact that a character was just murdered or something like that, it may not be the best movie. Charlie himself isn't even a child-friendly character. He cheats, steals, lies, etc.Personally, I don't think that this makes ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" a bad movie. I grew up watching it, as did all of my friends, and we all turned out fine. However, with the sheltered childhood kids are given anymore, it's no surprise that protective mothers have their reasons for hating this movie.At it's heart, this movie has a good message and it's not all about the bad things in life. There is plenty of good in it that can teach kids more than the bad in the beginning will.It's a very sweet movie that's able to make itself different from other kids' movies, but perhaps, not all kids can enjoy it for what it is. If you're a parent, I'd suggest you take a look at it first or, at least, watch it with them. If you don't think your kiddo can really handle the dark themes that's underlying beneath the ""talking dogs,"" then simply take it out and put in something more child-friendly.""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" is a good movie, but maybe not the best ""kid's movie"" out there.",5,"A movie meant for kids, but probably shouldn't be.",1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,2770,"['Dogs', 'Go', 'Heaven', 'movie', 'geared', 'children', 'perhaps', 'should', ""n't"", 'be.It', 'was', 'favorite', 'mine', 'growing', 'up', 'think', 'young', 'age', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'grasp', 'dark', 'undertones', 'ideas', 'were', 'going', 'such', 'Charlie', 'finding', 'Hell', 'dream', 'Satan', 'had', 'appeared', 'scene', 'later', 'was', 'still', 'able', 'enjoy', 'what', 'was.Now', 'seeing', 'again', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'love', ""'m"", 'starting', 'think', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'so', 'good', 'kids', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shocked', 'darkness', 'sprinkled', 'something', 'never', 'picked', 'up', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'However', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'movie', 'just', 'slightly', 'changed', 'view', 'it.The', 'story', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'apparently', 'mix', 'named', 'Charlie', 'B.', 'Barkin', 'Dachshund', 'friend', 'Itchy', 'Itchiford', 'being', 'busted', 'jail', 'dog', 'pound', 'Charlie', 'reunite', 'old', 'Pit-Bull', 'friend', 'Carface', 'only', 'be', 'murdered', 'nice', 'night', 'partying', 'celebration', 'However', 'Charlie', 'system', 'able', 'send', 'back', 'Earth', 'little', 'trip', 'heaven', 'Soon', 'rescue', 'young', 'Ann-Marie', 'orphan', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'talk', 'animals', 'Charlie', 'being', 'scheming', 'mutt', 'promises', 'help', 'find', 'family', 'only', 'use', 'ability', 'make', 'Itchy', 'fortune.Now', 'cute', 'movie', 'okay', 'kids', 'get', 'talking', 'dogs', 'afterall', 'not', 'what', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'rather', 'violent', 'scenes', 'child', 'would', 'be', 'smart', 'enough', 'catch', 'fact', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'murdered', 'something', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'even', 'child-friendly', 'character', 'steals', 'lies', 'etc.Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'All', 'Dogs', 'Go', 'Heaven', 'bad', 'movie', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'did', 'friends', 'turned', 'out', 'fine', 'However', 'sheltered', 'childhood', 'kids', 'are', 'given', 'anymore', 'surprise', 'protective', 'mothers', 'have', 'reasons', 'hating', 'movie.At', 'heart', 'movie', 'good', 'message', 'not', 'bad', 'things', 'life', 'plenty', 'good', 'can', 'teach', 'kids', 'more', 'bad', 'beginning', 'will.It', 'very', 'sweet', 'movie', 'able', 'make', 'different', 'other', 'kids', 'movies', 'perhaps', 'not', 'kids', 'can', 'enjoy', 'what', ""'re"", 'parent', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'take', 'look', 'first', 'least', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'kiddo', 'can', 'really', 'handle', 'dark', 'underlying', 'talking', 'dogs', 'then', 'simply', 'take', 'out', 'put', 'something', 'more', 'child-friendly', 'Dogs', 'Go', 'Heaven', 'good', 'movie', 'maybe', 'not', 'best', 'kid', 'movie', 'there']",N/A

As a child you watch a cartoon for the animation not for the story.  As an adult though you tend to get more out of films like this because, while being a cartoon, `All Dogs go to Heaven' is so much more.  With a moral that is so profound films of today tackle it over and over, this film succeeds mainly because we are given a timeless lesson in the most unlikely of places.The story revolves around Charlie (voiced by Burt Reynolds) and his partner in crime Itchy (voiced by Dom DeLuise) who are murdered by crime lord Carface (voiced by Vic Taybak).  After ascending to heaven only to return back to earth in order to live a life of crime, Charlie comes across Anne-Marie (voiced by Judith Barsi), a young girl who is being used by Carface to further his gambling efforts.  At first stealing her away for his own selfish gain, Charlie begins to form a strong friendship with Anne-Marie that is soon compromised by not only his own morally corrupt tendencies, but also the growing dangers of Carface and his bloodlust towards Charlie.Yes, as some have mentioned this cartoon borders on the dark overtones, but remember that the reason this is so `scary' if you should so call it is because as adults we can see the truth inside the sad story, but as children they will miss that entirely and will be absorbed in the animation and the `cute little puppies'...I guaranty it.

Charlie is a pro con artist and will do anything for money. In the film, Charlie is double crossed and killed by his boss Carface. When Charlie goes to heaven, he meets a Whippet Angel who he dances with and starts to fall in love with, but then he steals his watch from heaven, winds it up, and comes back to life. But then he hears the angel tell him he can't come back to heaven. As the film goes on, Charlie meets a little orphan girl who can talk to animals. Her name is Anne-Marie, and Charlie wants to use her gift to make money. Charlie then starts making lots of money all the while making Anne-Marie happy by buying her tons of clothing and promising he will find her a family as well as help the poor. Anne-Marie later finds out that Charlie has been stealing money from people for his own benefit, and she gets upset about it. Charlie then begins having nightmares of what the Whippet Angel said to him. The next day, Anne-Marie returns the wallet to the family, and she begins to bond with the loving man and woman, who are surprised to hear that she is an orphan.Near the end of the movie, Charlie gives his life in order to save Anne-Marie, and the Whippet Angel tells Charlie he can come back to heaven for his good deed. The ending made me cry during the scene where Charlie is about to go back to heaven, he wakes up Anne-Marie and tells her he has to go. He then tells her to take care of Itchy because he doesn't have anyone. Anne-Marie hugs Charlie and they both say they will miss each other.

In this 1989, Don Bluth release, even the music seems to further the plot while being weirdly catchy.WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: [some plot spoilers below]The title tells us to expect that 'All DOGS GO TO HEAVEN', but that sometimes the road to deserving to be in heaven is a bumpy one. As the film begins, 'Charlie Barkin' [voice of Burt Reynolds] is breaking out of Doggie Prison, with the help of loyal sidekick 'Itchy' [Dom DeLuise] and that's just where the action begins.You see, Charlie's partner in crime, 'Carface' [Vic Tayback] has been thriving since Charlie's incarceration, in their jointly owned gambling parlor which has done record business. Carface, however, has a secret weapon which Itchy told Charlie was in fact a ""monster"". The monster, as it turns out, is a little orphan girl named Ann-Marie [Judith Barsi], who can speak to animals and thereby find out which animal will win various gaming events. She also will represent Charlie's ultimate test toward being redeemed. Oh, but first he must die! Having decided that Charlie is not welcomed to the new and improved gambling casino, Carface arranges a drowning accident for Charlie and he does drown, but he returns -- somehow [rather clearly presented in the film].YOU SEE -- ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN BECAUSE ALL DOGS ARE 'SUPPOSED' TO BE GOOD!The rest of the film, after Charlies untimely death, is about his road to redemption via Ann-Marie. It is a bumpy road and it has numerous detours, but it does get to the finish line rather nicely. The basic theme hinges around Charlie's ability to get past the temptation of exploiting the little orphan for personal gain in the form of gambling, and doing what's right for her - getting her parents that care for her. This is a hard road for Charlie and an interesting one full of well executed diversions along the way.*-----> PRINCIPAL VOICE TALENTS &lt;-----*Burt Reynolds  - Charlie [Voice]Judith Barsi  - Anne-Marie [Voice]Dom DeLuise  - Itchy [Voice]Vic Tayback  - Carface [Voice]Charles Nelson Reilly  - Killer [Voice]Melba Moore  - Whippet Angel [Voice]Candy Devine  - Vera [Voice]Ken Page  - King Gator [Voice]Loni Anderson  - Flo [Voice]BOTTOM LINE: THEY SING - DANCE & ENTERTAIN YET STILL MANAGE TO HAVE A HIGHLY MORAL PLOTWe only have this animated feature on VHS and have almost worn it out.

When I asked him if he wanted to see the original, he said ""what original?"". I was stunned. How could anyone not have seen the first ADGH? It was mind boggling. I then took it upon myself to look through the hundreds of VHS tapes we had and find ADGH. After hors of searching I finally found it and popped it into the VCR. Wow, I was stunned. I had expected to be disappointed by how bad yet another of the movies I loved as a kid really was. But instead I ended up likening it a whole lot better now that I was older. This movie is so moving at moments that I really think it can make a grown man cry (all through it's not likely to have the same effect on little kids. They just won't understand what's going on). Eth part when Anne Marie is singing in the attic of the abandoned church is one of the saddest parts of any movie that I have ever seen. But the real treat I found was that the songs that I loved as a kid don't annoy me now that I'm 17. In fact, there almost as good (Anne Maries is better now that I know what she's singing about).Word of caution though, in this movie there is a lot of stuff that you won't want a small kid to see. There's drinking, smoking, murder, death, hell, gambling, fist fights, gunfights, a singing alligator, and one of the scariest depictions of hell ever to be shown on screen. But I think that if the kids over 6 years old they can handle it. Just because they see a dog smoking doesn't mean they'll immediately go out and start to smoke.

275822,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,6301964225,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[8, 11]","Around the late 1970's, animator Don Bluth, frustrated with the output his company, Disney was churning, defected from the Mouse House to form his own studio.  His first production, THE SECRET OF NIMH, was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day.  This was followed by AN AMERICAN TAIL and THE LAND BEFORE TIME, both of which were made under the involvement of Steven Spielberg and were commercially successful.  Although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of NIMH, they still are very charming, enjoyable features for both children and grown-ups.  But before long, Don Bluth had his first major misfire with ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN; critics were especially harsh on this film, and matters weren't helped by the fact that it opened alongside Disney's THE LITTLE MERMAID.Considering that the movie has such a friendly-sounding title, one would expect ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN to be pleasant family fare.  Instead Bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling, deceit, crime, mistreatment, and murder.  That itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say, but it does call into question over whether the film is for children.  On the other hand, it's hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN.  In short, it's a movie with a major identity crisis.Set in a dreary junkyard of New Orleans, the movie starts out when Charlie B. Barkin, a rough-and-tumble German shepherd, is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner, a nasty, cigar-puffing pitbull, Carface.  Before you know it, Charlie finds himself in heaven, albeit by default.  Here a whippet angel, Annabelle, tells him that ""all dogs go to heaven because unlike people, dogs are usually loyal and kind.""  This line represents the confused nature of the movie, since the dogs in the movie, the whippet aside, are presented as anything but.Upon realizing that he's been murdered, Charlie steals his way back to Earth and plots to get even with Carface.  With the reluctant help of his dachshund pal Itchy, Charlie ""rescues"" Carface's prize, AnneMarie, a human girl who can talk to animals (in order to predict who will win the rat races).  Charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family, but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring Carface down.  Although he refuses to admit it, Charlie does grow to love AnneMarie...The concept of the story isn't as problematic as the execution.  Aside from the human girl AnneMarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three-quarters through (with the vocal pipes of Ken Page), none of the other characters emerge as likeable, nor frankly, are even worth caring about.  Unfortunately, that also applies to Charlie; in trying to make him an anti-hero, the script (composed by more than ten writers) only succeeds in rendering the character TOO unlovable.  As such, the audience feels no empathy for Charlie, and worse, his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing.  (Further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from Burt Reynolds.)Besides the lack of an endearing lead, the movie's other problem is in the structure of the story.  The slowly-paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie's running time.  The aforementioned musical alligator (who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats) seems to have been thrown in from nowhere, as does a scene where Charlie tries to show his generosity to AnneMarie by feeding a pack of pastel-colored pups pizza.  The whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft; a bit more polish could have made this a tighter, impactful story.Matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by Charlie Strouse and T.J. Kuenster (AnneMarie's song and the gator's ballad are the only good ones; the latter in particular benefits from Ken Page's mellifluous vocal) or the uneven voice cast.  As mentioned, Burt Reynolds' stiff and lifeless Charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further (the only exception is a fiery confession to Itchy about his true intentions toward the end).  Dom DeLuise as Itchy is pretty good, but he's had better roles, notably Tiger in AN AMERICAN TAIL and Jeremy in THE SECRET OF NIMH.  Ken Page, as mentioned, is awesome in anything he does, but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best.  Similarly wasted are Loni Anderson (as a collie who once sired a litter with Charlie), Melba Moore, and Charles Nelson Reilly.  Judith Barsi as AnneMarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable, partially because her character is the sole legitimately likeable one in this depressing and joyless show.Barsi aside, the only real positive about ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN is the animation.  Technically, this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from Bluth's team (by 1980's standards, that is), particularly a frightening scene where Charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine-demon.  If anything, the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling.On the whole, however, I cannot recommend ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN as good entertainment.  Even though I recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion, the overall package is not in the same league as Bluth's better efforts.  Animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry, but by the time it's over, ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth.",2,A luciously animated but unpleasant and

275823,A1T4KKG4E5W5VE,6301964225,"J. P. Suhr ""Slagar""","[0, 7]","A world of warning I recomend unless you are an adolescent 10-12 or older  you do not want to watch the  this movie.  This movie has  gambling in it and thugs and some  old violence seen in the ganster movies.  It talks about Charley.Charley was  a  naugty dog that carried only about himself.  The movie begins with Charlie and his pal Itch a wenner dog  breaking Charly out of prison.  I was real young when I saw this the first time about 9 maybe it scared the crap out of me.Anni Marry who unfortunately was not put in the sequel and the Christmas movie.Killer  and itch wer a hoot.  Carface, his thugs and King Gator not to mention the nightmare sequence when Charlie goes down into hell.  The party at the end when the river catches on fire kills  me.I hated this movie at first because it made dogs look bad but now I love it. I would rent int but because it so old Blockbuster does not have it avilable to rent anymore.The King Gator was  potrayed accurately as being savage.  He scared me  he was so big he was huge this alligator must have been about the size of a killer whale. About  Mabe  30 feet and  weighed probably about 30 tons probably.  Another reason the alligator scared me was he  came really close to eatting Charley.Since it was rate G which I 100 percent disagee with I think I should have been either PG or PG -13 because of the scene befor this when Charlie  and Any Marry ar in the markeet air Carface is on top of this big gun.  He start shoot at charlie with I belivie it was a ray gun.I just found out something really interest the King Gator is not a which doctor I thought he was awhich doctor becase he had a bone coming out of his nose.  Withc doctors  are belived to have supnatural abilities like to be able to steal  souls and stuff like that.The only  thing that saves Charlies from die a painfull death inside the alligator stomach is his howl.  The people who wrote the script for some reason which I have never figured out made the King Gator a music fantic.He thinks Charlie howl is beautiful he takes him out of his mouth.  In the chage with had been partly crushed by his huge teeth. Lets him loose and he refuse to eat Charlie instead the become friends.This I fought was cease and one percent a cat and  a dog possible  like int Oddis and milo. But an alligator the most vicious of all the reptiles next to the crocodile impossible.I also fought some parts where I human.  Like when carfcae ties Charlie up to a big Chain drops him into the water ro kill him was inhuman.  I also thought carface death at the end of the movie was in Human.  Come on you do not have a dog get devouured by and alligator in a movie that  hte book claims is appropriate for all ages rate G.While wher eon it whats with these rating system people they need to be more pick those sickos only made Scare Movie R  It was  alot nastery than that.If you like this see all dogs go to heaven 2.  I recomend that you don't see All dog Christmas Charlie which never should have been made. For it messed up  the whole Story line. Carface is not supposed to be alive he is supposed to be and he is supposed to be in Hell.",4,A good but scarilous film,1084233600,"05 11, 2004",2004,3137,"['world', 'warning', 'recomend', 'are', 'adolescent', '10-12', 'older', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'movie', 'gambling', 'thugs', 'old', 'violence', 'seen', 'ganster', 'movies', 'Charley.Charley', 'was', 'naugty', 'dog', 'carried', 'only', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'pal', 'Itch', 'wenner', 'dog', 'breaking', 'Charly', 'prison', 'was', 'real', 'young', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'time', '9', 'maybe', 'scared', 'crap', 'me.Anni', 'Marry', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'put', 'sequel', 'Christmas', 'movie.Killer', 'itch', 'wer', 'hoot', 'Carface', 'thugs', 'King', 'Gator', 'not', 'mention', 'nightmare', 'sequence', 'when', 'Charlie', 'down', 'hell', 'party', 'end', 'when', 'river', 'catches', 'fire', 'kills', 'me.I', 'hated', 'movie', 'first', 'made', 'dogs', 'look', 'bad', 'now', 'love', 'would', 'rent', 'int', 'so', 'old', 'Blockbuster', 'not', 'have', 'avilable', 'rent', 'anymore.The', 'King', 'Gator', 'was', 'potrayed', 'accurately', 'being', 'savage', 'scared', 'was', 'so', 'big', 'was', 'huge', 'alligator', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'size', 'killer', 'whale', 'Mabe', '30', 'feet', 'weighed', 'probably', '30', 'tons', 'probably', 'reason', 'alligator', 'scared', 'was', 'came', 'really', 'close', 'eatting', 'Charley.Since', 'was', 'rate', 'G', '100', 'percent', 'disagee', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'PG', 'PG', '-13', 'scene', 'befor', 'when', 'Charlie', 'Any', 'Marry', 'ar', 'markeet', 'air', 'Carface', 'top', 'big', 'gun', 'start', 'shoot', 'charlie', 'belivie', 'was', 'ray', 'gun.I', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'something', 'really', 'interest', 'King', 'Gator', 'not', 'doctor', 'thought', 'was', 'awhich', 'doctor', 'becase', 'had', 'bone', 'coming', 'nose', 'Withc', 'doctors', 'are', 'belived', 'have', 'supnatural', 'abilities', 'be', 'able', 'steal', 'souls', 'stuff', 'that.The', 'only', 'thing', 'Charlies', 'die', 'painfull', 'death', 'alligator', 'stomach', 'howl', 'people', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'reason', 'have', 'never', 'figured', 'out', 'made', 'King', 'Gator', 'music', 'fantic.He', 'Charlie', 'howl', 'beautiful', 'mouth', 'chage', 'had', 'been', 'partly', 'crushed', 'huge', 'teeth', 'loose', 'refuse', 'eat', 'Charlie', 'instead', 'become', 'friends.This', 'fought', 'was', 'cease', 'one', 'percent', 'cat', 'dog', 'possible', 'int', 'Oddis', 'milo', 'alligator', 'most', 'vicious', 'reptiles', 'crocodile', 'impossible.I', 'also', 'fought', 'parts', 'where', 'human', 'when', 'carfcae', 'ties', 'Charlie', 'up', 'big', 'Chain', 'water', 'ro', 'kill', 'was', 'inhuman', 'also', 'thought', 'carface', 'death', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'Human', 'Come', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'dog', 'get', 'devouured', 'alligator', 'movie', 'hte', 'book', 'claims', 'appropriate', 'ages', 'rate', 'G.While', 'eon', 'rating', 'system', 'people', 'need', 'be', 'more', 'pick', 'sickos', 'only', 'made', 'Scare', 'Movie', 'R', 'was', 'alot', 'nastery', 'that.If', 'see', 'dogs', 'go', 'heaven', '2', 'recomend', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'dog', 'Christmas', 'Charlie', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'messed', 'up', 'whole', 'Story', 'line', 'Carface', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'alive', 'supposed', 'be', 'supposed', 'be', 'Hell']",N/A

This had some cute and sweet moments, but overall just seemed too violent, difficult to explain, and dated for young children of today. The dogs in the movie are essentially a band of criminals, and one is killed by another. He goes to heaven because 'all dogs go to heaven' but wants to go back to avenge his death. He is told that if he does, he can never return to heaven, but he doesn't listen. On his return, he befriends a young orphan who can talk to animals, mostly because he wants to use her to gain inside info on horse races and the like. He eventually does genuinely come to care for her, and the story centers around his inner conflicts related to this. But for much of the movie he is a lying swindler bent on killing his killer, who is of course also still bent on killing him. It is really kind of a dog-infused mob pic. A far cry from 101 Dalmations or Lady and the Tramp or any animated dog movies of that ilk, which is what I was actually hoping for.The ending is sweet, and made up for some of the movie, but overall the constant killing threats and attempts made me uncomfortable with this film, and seemed to baffle my kids.

275844,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6301964225,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","Charlie B. Barkin is a dog, a German Shepherd mix in 1939 New Orleans. The dogs in this world have their own secret lives though, and Charlie's is one of a selfish crook and con-artist who runs a canine gambling establishment in the junkyard with his partner, gangsterish bulldog (I think) Carface. They each have their jittery sidekicks too. Charlie has sweet best-friend Itchy, and Carface has the psychotic nerd-dog Killer. As the film begins, Charlie and Itchy are breaking out of the pound, where Charlie is on Death Row. It's a little something Carface secretly arranged so he wouldn't have to share the gambling business with Charlie anymore. When Charlie and Itchy turn up at the casino that night, Carface and Killer move on to plan B. Long story short, Charlie goes to Heaven. But, he doesn't stay there long. Charlie finds his way back down (against warnings that he can never come back), and when he discovers Carface's big gambling secret to keep him always on top, a little (human) girl who can talk to animals, he decides to kidnap,... er, rescue her, so he can take his life back as top dog in town. And, so he does, promising the sweet, little, orphan girl (she's like 4 or something', I don't know) they will share their winnings with the poor and that he will help her find parents. Of course, Charlie being Charlie, he struggles to keep little Anne-Marie happy while serving his own ends, and soon he must deal with her wish for a home, Carface's impending retaliation, and the consequences of breaking out of Heaven!Sounds like a pretty intense and unusual plot for a American animated film, huh? Though there are those who complain about it, ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" certainly deserves some credit for braving adult themes and emotions. At times, creator Don Bluth could be found to be more daring in that department than competitors, not that it was Anime level (don't get me wrong, I'm a Disney guy myself, but it's all good). Of course, it was the pre-politically correct 1980's, so that helped too, even if the very end of it (1989). The film is not without a ton of problems though. For one thing, the dialogue, the story, and the animation is nerve-wracking. Imagine the Tex-Avery inspired scene in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (my all-time favorite film) in the beginning, when, in the cartoon being shot, Roger is flying and bouncy all over the kitchen on fire and whatnot. Imagine a whole feature like that! Okay, that is a little bit exaggerated, but there is something about this film that is like that. It is all over the place, it is noisy and confusing even at times it shouldn't be. The characters are stumbling and talking over each other all the time and it is, well, just tough to stay with it because you get a bit annoyed, frankly. This is, more than anything, when there are no humans around, and it's just dogs. I can kinda get that, but it complicates the storytelling, which, in general is not the best here. Bluth may have a major Disney background, and heck, I know he's done great things before this (Secret of NIMH is just awesome and much better than this film), but if one were to just watch this film, you get the idea he is not very good at directing. Oh, I'll give you the redeeming qualities soon though, don't worry, but besides the constant jabbering, wobbling, and sight gags going on, you've also got the problem of the music, plus the most regrettably unused setting. 1930's New Orleans? You could barely tell this was New Orleans aside from a brief shot of a Mardi Gras parade and a quick use of the French Quarter much later. Yeah, there's an alligator in this decked out for Mardi Gras, but he could have just as easily been a trap for the Chipmunks in the Chipmunk Adventure's big finale in the Rainforest (also a better film, by the way). Another key flub here? The use of music. None of it had a New Orleans feel, really. One tune was even Reggae or something. That's just a guess; I don't know much about music, but I know New Orleans type music when I hear it. The songs are all over the place, too. Some of the music here is surprisingly good (a very small fraction), while some is just awful. Like, bad direct-to-video animated musical awful. If you can't get the music right, don't do a musical (why, oh why was Lady and the Tramp 2 made as a musical? But I digress...). As for the 1939 part of it, besides the cars, you wouldn't know it really. And there are a few things here and there that did not look accurate. The idea of setting it in 1939 New Orleans sounds awesome, but it was totally wasted here. For contrast, put on ""The Princess and the Frog"". BIG difference. Now THAT's how you do period New Orleans (circa the 1920's)! And it doesn't let down in the music department either.Okay, so those are the big complaints, the poor use of music and setting, the frenetic scenes that can be irritating pretty much immediately, even when a quieter tone would have served the scene better (for example, the villain's scenes could have been played more like those in Oliver and Company, even though he was human there, and he would have been far more intimidating and far less annoying), and did I mention a key problem with the storytelling yet? It is so random and all over the place! Story shifts come out of nowhere and introduce important elements so suddenly and randomly (more of that freneticism), like the big alligator! In fact, that alligator bit even inspired a phrase, ""big lipped alligator moment,"" coined by the internet's Nostalgia Critic to refer to random, bizarre, and unimportant to the plot scenes like that. I would argue its plot importance since it introduces a character who provides some important help in the climax though (clearly the only reason the alligator is suddenly introduced). But, what about the good points of this much beloved film?There are some good ones. Like I mentioned first, this film has more adult elements than most American animated features (though it was actually made in Ireland, Don Bluth is considered an American filmmaker). The film is beautifully animated, as one would expect from Don Bluth. And, while some would argue this, there are a lot of really enjoyable characters here. Charlie, Anne-Marie, and some of the other good guys, though some can be annoying at times (like Itchy, even though I normally love Dom Deluise) are all pretty lovable in their own way. Burt Reynolds is fantastic as Charlie, by the way. Judith Barsi, the little girl who played Anne-Marie, was adorable. This film was actually released posthumously, after she and her mother were murdered by her father in 1988. Vic Tayback, of TV's ""Alice"" played villain ""Carface"", and he is well-cast considering, though his scenes that come easiest to mind are still far too frenetic (Charles Nelon Riley's ""Killer"" does not help!). The humans are mostly done in rotoscope, which you may or may not like. It's a good contrast with the hyper activity of the dogs though (which I realize is why the film is so frenetic, but for storytelling's sake..., I mean, Oliver and Co. is much easier to watch; even Roger Dangerfield).The emotional moments in ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"", and some of the dramatic elements, can be pretty effective, though I think this is strongest for those who can apply some nostalgic value to it (I probably made it just under the wire for this). If you didn't grow up with this movie, you probably won't fall in love with it now. Too many issues. I am not in love with it myself, and I sorta grew up with it (okay, I was starting High School, but that counts when you're a big animation fan/late bloomer like myself), but I can still enjoy it and have fond memories of it that I consider to be from my growing-up years. Would I take any Disney movie over this one? Yeah. The hand-drawn stuff, anyway, and some of the CGI, but not all of it. I'd take a few of Bluth's movies over this one too, but it isn't among his worst, either. It's somewhere in the middle. There's some cool stuff in this for sure, and you've got to give it originality points too. And it was for sure popular, as it had a theatrical sequel, a TV series, and a Christmas special, all of which I still need to see. Incidentally, I think I still have a couple of Wendy's Kids' Meal toys from this somewhere, or at least I had them for a long time. Notable, as they were among very few Wendy's toys that were comparable in quality to McD's and BK's (but, again, I digress).Overall, if you love animation, you should check this film out, but it's got problems. Be patient, because it gets MUCH better once Anne-Marie is introduced, but it takes a little while. Like most American animation, it is not as good as anything from Disney, but it's as close as anyone had gotten at that time. If you grew up loving this film, you'll definitely want to pick the Blu-Ray up. It doesn't look particularly great to me and is probably no better than the DVD (I'm not an expert on the technical stuff though), but at least it is in Widescreen on Blu, and I think it's the first time this movie has been released that way. That's reason enough to get it on Blu. Sadly though, it is such a low-budget release that there isn't even a menu. It's one of those Blus that runs in a loop. But, at least they still gave it one bonus feature, the theatrical trailer. That's more than some movies with menus get. Anyway, give it a try if you think you'll find something redeeming in this film. It has both good and bad qualities, and it belongs in any animation or Bluth fan's collection. Honestly, if you get through the whole film, I think you'll be glad you watched it, even if it can easily be described as a mess, there is still a story there with some interesting elements and beautiful animation. They put a lot of work into this, even if it needed to be rehashed a lot. A good and original idea at heart.",4,A Beloved Mess,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,9872,"['Charlie', 'B.', 'Barkin', 'dog', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'mix', '1939', 'New', 'Orleans', 'dogs', 'world',

He said as he banged his head against the wall several times.  Oh well.  I think from now on I need to take stock of which films I'm tossing, and which films I'm keeping.But, to the movie.  It's a decent enough flick, telling of the greed and redemption of a dog living on the edge, who passes on, but steals a second chance for himself.  Highly original and extremely inventive story telling, this is one of the best animated children's films with an edge for adults that I've yet to come across.  Reynolds is the perfect voice for a roguish dog, and his ever faithful friend is of course played by the late Dom Deluise.The little girl is just as endearing as the two dogs accompanying her.  It's hard to believe that she got mixed up in the capers of a mutt like Charlie, but her heart of gold sees his true character before time calls him back to his ultimate fate.Don Bluth, master character animator and former Disney veteran, creates a visual feast of a tale, and brings to life his imagery of canine antics by not only drawing key sequences, but also by directing an all star fast.Incredible stuff.  Now, if I could only find my lost dvd... dang it!P.S. I don't know why, but at the time when I rented the VHS I felt really compelled to see it.  I didn't particularly dislike the film, nor was I a huge fan of it either.  But I liked the dog's adventure for what it was.

It does contain some things that may upset younger, or less mature viewers. The plot is slightly on the dark side, a change from the usual happy, peppy cartoons. But I love it none the less. The characters are unique for an animated film. Charlie - although in all respects you should hate, atleast for the begging of the film, is a lovable mutt and is enjoyable to watch. Anne Marie is a darling character, adorable from every aspect. Especially her voice, which was done to perfection by Judith Barsi. I admit the villian is more than annoying, and not incredibly intimidating. The basic plot is good, and the animation is nice. Annabelle (The Whippe in heaven) is a slightly ditzy little creature, who is enjoyable enough in her little part. The songs are okay. &quot;You Can't Keep A Good Dog Down' is good enough, but &quot;Lets Make Music Together&quot; needs a bit to be desired.  In short, do not buy this movie if you want to show your little 3 year old the happy dogs running around, go for 101 Dalmatians if you want that. But if your looking for perhaps a more realistic, darker movie, that is enjoyable and wont make adults cringe too much, this one is for you.",4,Not for younger viewers...,991612800,"06 4, 2001",2001,1281,"['agree', 'movie', 'not', 'real', 'kids', 'movie', 'not', 'younger', 'kids', '7', 'contain', 'things', 'may', 'upset', 'younger', 'less', 'mature', 'viewers', 'plot', 'slightly', 'dark', 'side', 'change', 'usual', 'happy', 'peppy', 'cartoons', 'love', 'less', 'characters', 'are', 'unique', 'animated', 'film', 'Charlie', 'respects', 'should', 'hate', 'atleast', 'begging', 'film', 'lovable', 'mutt', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Anne', 'Marie', 'darling', 'character', 'adorable', 'aspect', 'Especially', 'voice', 'was', 'done', 'perfection', 'Judith', 'Barsi', 'admit', 'villian', 'more', 'annoying', 'not', 'incredibly', 'intimidating', 'basic', 'plot', 'good', 'animation', 'nice', 'Annabelle', 'Whippe', 'heaven', 'slightly', 'ditzy', 'little', 'creature', 'who', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'little', 'part', 'songs', 'are', 'okay', 'quot', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Keep', 'Good', 'Dog', 'Down', 'good', 'enough', 'quot', 'Lets', 'Make', 'Music', 'Together', 'quot', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'short', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'movie', 'want', 'show', 'little', '3', 'year', 'old', 'happy', 'dogs', 'running', 'around', 'go', '101', 'Dalmatians', 'want', 'looking', 'perhaps', 'more', 'realistic', 'darker', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'wont', 'make', 'adults', 'cringe', 'too', 'much', 'one']",N/A
