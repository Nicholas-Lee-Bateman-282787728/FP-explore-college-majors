There were a few shortcuts in the movie and the mother grins like the village fool throughout the movie, but it's a great story with good adventure and wonderful acting by the kid and his grandfather.The story moves along at a pretty good clip. Adults and children will enjoy this romp  through nature, though some of it is a tad contrived, it still came out as solid good entertainment.Review by Dear Miss Mermaid, author of ""Hurricanes and Hangovers""",4,Great Movie!
