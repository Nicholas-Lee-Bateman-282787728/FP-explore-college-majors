1407517,AFMZIREJ0SQIW,B004GZZGVI,A. Mendez,"[8, 10]","Rather than summarizing the episodes (which has excellently been done by other reviewers), I will talk about the major feeling of the story, and why this is a great Anime series worth the purchase.  Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood deals with several ""mature"" situations: war, betrayal, deception, revenge.  What makes this series great is that in the middle of these tragic occurrences, the creators integrate elements of personal redemption, forgiveness and even comedy to ease the tension.  This is a series that all Anime fans can enjoy because of the range of genres/styles and topics touched.I bought the Blu-ray version.  Like the previous three releases, it comes in a dual (standard Blu-ray size) case with two discs  inside a nice paper case, with a set of picture cards.  The reason I am giving 4 stars to this product is not because of the lack of quality, which is great by the way.  I am giving it 4 stars because the episodes in here are a bridge to the conclusion and not much happens.  To truly enjoy this classic in the making, you need to watch the first 3 parts before getting part 4.  Nonetheless, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has a compelling story filled with surprises, a great plot, great character development and overall quality.  Part 4 is 4.3 stars for me; the series overall is 5 stars without a doubt.",4,Towards the end of a great series,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,1336,"['Rather', 'summarizing', 'episodes', 'excellently', 'been', 'done', 'other', 'reviewers', 'will', 'talk', 'major', 'feeling', 'story', 'why', 'great', 'Anime', 'series', 'purchase', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Brotherhood', 'deals', 'several', 'mature', 'situations', 'war', 'betrayal', 'deception', 'revenge', 'What', 'series', 'great', 'middle', 'tragic', 'occurrences', 'creators', 'integrate', 'elements', 'personal', 'redemption', 'forgiveness', 'even', 'comedy', 'ease', 'tension', 'series', 'Anime', 'fans', 'can', 'enjoy', 'range', 'genres/styles', 'topics', 'touched.I', 'bought', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'previous', 'three', 'releases', 'dual', 'standard', 'Blu-ray', 'size', 'case', 'two', 'discs', 'nice', 'paper', 'case', 'set', 'picture', 'cards', 'reason', 'am', 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'product', 'not', 'lack', 'quality', 'great', 'way', 'am', 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'bridge', 'conclusion', 'not', 'much', 'happens', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'making', 'need', 'watch', 'first', '3', 'parts', 'getting', 'part', '4', 'Nonetheless', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Brotherhood', 'compelling', 'story', 'filled', 'surprises', 'great', 'plot', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'overall', 'quality', 'Part', '4', '4.3', 'stars', 'series', 'overall', '5', 'stars', 'doubt']",N/A
1407518,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B004GZZGVI,Arch Stanton,"[0, 0]","This part begins with the past. Finally the origin of the homunculi is revealed along with much that has happened since. These DVD set divisions are well done. The series as a whole has 3 major climaxes before the final one. The death of a major character (who shall remain unnamed) is the first one, the attack on the homunculi at the end of set 2 is the second, and the third comes at the end of the Briggs battle. After these climaxes there are several slower episodes while the show changes direction and sets up the next hurdle. So each set starts off slow and works up to a crescendo. This set doesn't end on a climax because it cuts off near the beginning of the massive final battle. That doesn't make this set any less gripping, but it does mean that if you start this one you'd better have the next one ready to finish it.All of the characters find themselves preparing for the final battle, a fight that they know is unlikely to succeed. The buildup to it is played quite well and by the time the fighting commences it feels like a well-planned and (loosely) coordinated assault as opposed to a more typical set piece battle. There is quite a large space of time covered here and Ed's character design is aged by several months. Given that leap in time it seems unexpected that the rest of the series takes place on a single day. The last five episodes are all part of the final battle. The action scenes are well done and feel unique. None of the fights drag on long enough to wear out their welcome and each one builds up the threat. Al particularly is in serious trouble here while Ed's direction is highly unexpected.",5,The Final Battle Begins,1315699200,"09 11, 2011",2011,1632,"['part', 'past', 'Finally', 'origin', 'homunculi', 'revealed', 'much', 'happened', 'DVD', 'set', 'divisions', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'series', 'whole', '3', 'major', 'climaxes', 'final', 'one', 'death', 'major', 'character', 'who', 'shall', 'remain', 'unnamed', 'first', 'one', 'attack', 'homunculi', 'end', 'set', '2', 'second', 'third', 'end', 'Briggs', 'battle', 'climaxes', 'are', 'several', 'slower', 'episodes', 'show', 'direction', 'up', 'next', 'hurdle', 'So', 'set', 'slow', 'up', 'crescendo', 'set', ""n't"", 'end', 'climax', 'beginning', 'massive', 'final', 'battle', ""n't"", 'make', 'set', 'less', 'gripping', 'mean', 'start', 'one', ""'d"", 'better', 'have', 'next', 'one', 'ready', 'finish', 'it.All', 'characters', 'find', 'preparing', 'final', 'battle', 'fight', 'know', 'unlikely', 'succeed', 'buildup', 'played', 'quite', 'well', 'time', 'fighting', 'well-planned', 'loosely', 'coordinated', 'assault', 'opposed', 'more', 'typical', 'set', 'piece', 'battle', 'quite', 'large', 'space', 'time', 'covered', 'here', 'Ed', 'character', 'design', 'aged', 'several', 'months', 'Given', 'leap', 'time', 'unexpected', 'rest', 'series', 'place', 'single', 'day', 'last', 'five', 'episodes', 'are', 'part', 'final', 'battle', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'feel', 'unique', 'None', 'fights', 'drag', 'long', 'enough', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'one', 'threat', 'Al', 'particularly', 'serious', 'trouble', 'here', 'Ed', 'direction', 'highly', 'unexpected']",N/A
1407519,A3K65JH0785O7V,B004GZZGVI,"Bryce Campbell ""just another anime fan""","[3, 7]","Before I go into this review, I received this as a pre-ordered Christmas present from Rightstuf, who has pretty much delivered each of my previous pre-orders about two weeks before the official release.  However, unlike the others, I had no idea that it arrived three days ago, until I checked its order status yesterday.Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, just like its predecessor anime, is about two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who have committed a taboo and paid a heavy price for it. Edward lost his arm and leg, while his brother lost his body. Now, they are seeking the philosopher's stone to regain what they lost, even if it means joining the military.In this set, Al is still trying to reach Winry and company, in order to warn them that Briggs has been taken over by the enemy. Back in Baschool, Edward, Major Miles, and Miles' fellow Briggs soldiers engage a plan to take out Kimblee, who sees right through the plan. Because of this fact, Edward is attacked by two other chimera, whom were part of the group trying to locate Scar.  In Lior, things seem to be at peace, as some time has passed from when the Elrics exposed their priest as a fraud. It is during this time when Hohenheim makes a visit. Also, Major General Armstrong appears before Bradley. Finally, a former ally of Greed has a not so great reunion with Greed.This series is definitely staying interesting and consistent. The fights that happen it this set are also interesting, such as Ed's first fight with Pride.  If that's not interesting, we get to see the origins of Hohenheim and Father.  There aren't really any major new characters to talk about as the first three DVDs pretty much introduced all of them, in one way or another, but a lot of content from the manga has been covered right from the start, whereas both the first and third DVD releases started off with fillers. Hohenheim's visit to Liore and the way he ""fixed"" Izumi's troubles showed that Father, the leader of the homunculi, was not the only one capable of performing transmutations without a circle or movement, but that's kind of a given, due to what we see from the fall of Xerxes, but it is interesting nonetheless. Alphonse also made a nice stand against Pride, after he had consumed Gluttony.If you think that this review is going to be all good, you are dead wrong.  There are two noticeable problems. First, there is the sub inconsistency for openings and endings that has so far plagued the dub release, which I talked about on my review for Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood Part 3.  In case you have not read it, I complained that one episode they were English subbed and the next they were subbed in Japanese using Roman characters, otherwise called Romaji. Some people like it, but I am not pleased with it. I am just glad that it stayed consistent.  Second, the reunion between Greed and one of his former friends was not so great.  It was dubbed and handled as good as it could, since FUNimation had to get a new voice actor for Greed in the third DVD release of Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. However, it can be confusing.  The former friend of Greed recognizes Greed in his new host due to both his voice and desires. What does not make sense about it though is the last time they had contact was when Greed's old voice actor was around, so Greed does not really have the same voice as before. As I stated before though, FUNimation handled the reunion as good as they could have due to the change, otherwise it would not have stayed as true to the manga as Brotherhood's last part has been.  Outside of those problems, this is definitely a good release and the humor of Major and Major General Armstrong fighting was humorous enough that the flaws can be overlooked.For those that do not like the English dubbed, the Japanese audio track is available with English subs.I recommend this series to everyone for its unique story.  If you already have the other three, I do not see why you should not get this, since it leads exactly into the events that will be picked up in the next and final release of episodes for FMA Brotherhood.",4,"Good Release, but Can be Confusing (and continued subtitle inconsistency)",1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,4110,"['go', 'review', 'received', 'pre-ordered', 'Christmas', 'present', 'Rightstuf', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'delivered', 'previous', 'pre-orders', 'two', 'weeks', 'official', 'release', 'However', 'others', 'had', 'idea', 'arrived', 'three', 'days', 'ago', 'checked', 'order', 'status', 'yesterday.Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'Brotherhood', 'just', 'predecessor', 'anime', 'two', 'brothers', 'Edward', 'Alphonse', 'Elric', 'who', 'have', 'committed', 'taboo', 'paid', 'heavy', 'price', 'Edward', 'lost', 'arm', 'leg', 'brother', 'lost', 'body', 'Now', 'are', 'seeking', 'philosopher', 'stone', 'regain', 'what', 'lost', 'even', 'joining', 'military.In', 'set', 'Al', 'still', 'trying', 'reach', 'Winry', 'company', 'order', 'warn', 'Briggs', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'enemy', 'Back', 'Baschool', 'Edward', 'Major', 'Miles', 'Miles', 'fellow', 'Briggs', 'soldiers', 'engage', 'plan', 'take', 'out', 'Kimblee', 'who', 'right', 'plan', 'fact', 'Edward', 'attacked', 'two', 'other', 'chimera', 'whom', 'were', 'part', 'group', 'trying', 'locate', 'Scar', 'Lior', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'peace', 'time', 'passed', 'when', 'Elrics', 'exposed', 'priest', 'fraud', 'time', 'when', 'Hohenheim', 'visit', 'Also', 'Major', 'General', 'Armstrong', 'Bradley', 'Finally', 'former', 'ally', 'Greed', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'reunion', 'Greed.This', 'series', 'definitely', 'staying', 'interesting', 'consistent', 'fights', 'happen', 'set', 'are', 'also', 'interesting', 'such', 'Ed', 'first', 'fight', 'Pride', 'not', 'interesting', 'get', 'see', 'origins', 'Hohenheim', 'Father', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'major', 'new', 'characters', 'talk', 'first', 'three', 'DVDs', 'pretty', 'much', 'introduced', 'one', 'way', 'lot', 'content', 'manga', 'been', 'covered', 'right', 'start', 'first', 'third', 'DVD', 'releases', 'started', 'off', 'fillers', 'Hohenheim', 'visit', 'Liore', 'way', 'fixed', 'Izumi', 'troubles', 'showed', 'Father', 'leader', 'homunculi', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'capable', 'performing', 'transmutations', 'circle', 'movement', 'kind', 'given', 'due', 'what', 'see', 'fall', 'Xerxes', 'interesting', 'nonetheless', 'Alphonse', 'also', 'made', 'nice', 'stand', 'Pride', 'had', 'consumed', 'Gluttony.If', 'think', 'review', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'are', 'dead', 'wrong', 'are', 'two', 'noticeable', 'problems', 'First', 'sub', 'inconsistency', 'openings', 'endings', 'so', 'far', 'plagued', 'dub', 'release', 'talked', 'review', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'Brotherhood', 'Part', '3', 'case', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'complained', 'one', 'episode', 'were', 'English', 'subbed', 'next', 'were', 'subbed', 'Japanese', 'using', 'Roman', 'characters', 'otherwise', 'called', 'Romaji', 'people', 'am', 'not', 'pleased', 'am', 'just', 'glad', 'stayed', 'consistent', 'Second', 'reunion', 'Greed', 'one', 'former', 'friends', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'dubbed', 'handled', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'FUNimation', 'had', 'get', 'new', 'voice', 'actor', 'Greed', 'third', 'DVD', 'release', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'Brotherhood', 'However', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'former', 'friend', 'Greed', 'Greed', 'new', 'host', 'due', 'voice', 'desires', 'What', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'last', 'time', 'had', 'contact', 'was', 'when', 'Greed', 'old', 'voice', 'actor', 'was', 'around', 'so', 'Greed', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'same', 'voice', 'before', 'stated', 'FUNimation', 'handled', 'reunion', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'due', 'change', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'stayed', 'true', 'manga', 'Brotherhood', 'last', 'part', 'been', 'problems', 'definitely', 'good', 'release', 'humor', 'Major', 'Major', 'General', 'Armstrong', 'fighting', 'was', 'humorous', 'enough', 'flaws', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked.For', 'do', 'not', 'English', 'dubbed', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'track', 'available', 'English', 'subs.I', 'recommend', 'series', 'everyone', 'unique', 'story', 'already', 'have', 'other', 'three', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'why', 'should', 'not', 'get', 'exactly', 'events', 'will', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'next', 'final', 'release', 'episodes', 'FMA', 'Brotherhood']",N/A

1407525,ACFZ53LQVMXCE,B004GZZGVI,Kay One,"[2, 3]","Ok, I'm one of the rare few folks who started into watching FMA:Brotherhood without having seen the original series at all. To be honest, while I like some shounen series like DBZ, I do find the classic shounen anime cliches and tropes to get a little repetitive and when the original FMA series aired on US TV, I caught a few random eps and it seemed pretty good, but something about the show failed to hook me in. Fast foward to the present and I learned about the new remake series that came out in 2009 and thought 'whats the point?' and was intrigued at the premise that this series follows the manga series faithfully, which was reportedly a much better story than the original anime, which thru no fault of its own, had a very incomplete (barely the first quarter) manga story to work with. They stretched out what they had to work with into half a tv series then completed the rest with their own original storyline that concluded with an ending that runs hot or cold with fans.Luckily, hearing about FMA:Bro late, the entire series was already aired and fansubbed but since the first 4 volumes were out commercially, I rented all the available discs released by Funimation and finished the rest of the series with what I could find elsewhere. And all I can say is:Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood probably ranks among my top 10 favorite anime series...of all time.And that is saying something for someone who has been watching anime since the late 80s. Eventually I watched the original series afterwards which I found relatively dissapointing compared to this incredible successor.Part 4 covers eps 40-51 and what can I say that hasn't already been said?  This runaway train of a story continues to dazzle, amaze, horror and uplift as this newest chapter now explores the far past with the tragic origin of Van Hohenheim, the secret to his immortality and his connection to the enigmatic villain 'Father' who is the creator of the Homunculi and new main antagonist of the series.  BTW, Hohenheim's origin story in this series is FAR better than the frankly hackneyed and dull origin story of the original series.  Plus Hohenheim is a far more interesting and likeable character period.  Also, Father, altho introduced in the previous volume also reveals his interesting origin which is closely tied to the tragedy that befalls the ancient Kingdom of Xerxes and is a foreshadow of things to come. Events come to a head as the various characters on both sides of this now extensive cast prepare for the fateful 'Promised day' where all answers are supposed to be revealed.  Ed and Al get separated and follow their own paths each encountering new enemies and allies along the way.  A whole new slew of enemies are revealed in the terrifying form of the zombie, undead warriors in the midst of a grand coup d'etat of the Amnestris central goverment.What I really like about this series is there seem to be no throwaway characters or throwaway plot points. Seemingly insignificant events and people introduced earlier in the series have a strong impact on later events which are revealed in a logical and flowing fashion.  Very little feels forced or contrived in this show so far as all the various, disparate plot threads are weaving into a tight tapestry that all fits very well.  Kudos to manga author Arakawa for creating such an intricate and fantastic story that keeps the attention of even the most jaded anime watchers such as myself.  Again more fantastic fight scenes, great humor and graphic but well done violence, everything done in this series has been elevated a level or two compared to the old show.My only negative is that by the end of this volume...you still have another 11 eps to go before the stunning conclusion of this incredible story and as of the writing of this review, the final volume won't be out for at least another 2 months, oh the pain.",5,Best volume yet!,1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,3879,"['Ok', ""'m"", 'one', 'rare', 'few', 'folks', 'who', 'started', 'watching', 'FMA', 'Brotherhood', 'having', 'seen', 'original', 'series', 'be', 'honest', 'like', 'shounen', 'series', 'DBZ', 'do', 'find', 'classic', 'shounen', 'anime', 'cliches', 'tropes', 'get', 'little', 'repetitive', 'when', 'original', 'FMA', 'series', 'aired', 'US', 'TV', 'caught', 'few', 'random', 'eps', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'good', 'something', 'show', 'failed', 'hook', 'Fast', 'foward', 'present', 'learned', 'new', 'remake', 'series', 'came', 'out', '2009', 'thought', ""'whats"", 'point', 'was', 'intrigued', 'premise', 'series', 'manga', 'series', 'faithfully', 'was', 'reportedly', 'much', 'better', 'story', 'original', 'anime', 'fault', 'own', 'had', 'very', 'incomplete', 'barely', 'first', 'quarter', 'story', 'work', 'stretched', 'out', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'tv', 'series', 'then', 'completed', 'rest', 'own', 'original', 'storyline', 'concluded', 'ending', 'hot', 'cold', 'fans.Luckily', 'hearing', 'FMA', 'Bro', 'late', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'already', 'aired', 'fansubbed', 'first', '4', 'volumes', 'were', 'out', 'commercially', 'rented', 'available', 'discs', 'released', 'Funimation', 'finished', 'rest', 'series', 'what', 'could', 'find', 'elsewhere', 'can', 'say', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Brotherhood', 'probably', 'top', '10', 'favorite', 'anime', 'series', 'time.And', 'saying', 'something', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'watching', 'anime', 'late', '80s', 'Eventually', 'watched', 'original', 'series', 'afterwards', 'found', 'relatively', 'dissapointing', 'compared', 'incredible', 'successor.Part', '4', 'covers', 'eps', '40-51', 'what', 'can', 'say', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'runaway', 'train', 'story', 'dazzle', 'amaze', 'horror', 'uplift', 'newest', 'chapter', 'now', 'far', 'past', 'tragic', 'origin', 'Van', 'Hohenheim', 'secret', 'immortality', 'connection', 'enigmatic', 'villain', 'who', 'creator', 'Homunculi', 'new', 'main', 'antagonist', 'series', 'BTW', 'Hohenheim', 'origin', 'story', 'series', 'FAR', 'better', 'frankly', 'hackneyed', 'dull', 'origin', 'story', 'original', 'series', 'Hohenheim', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'likeable', 'character', 'period', 'Also', 'Father', 'altho', 'introduced', 'previous', 'volume', 'also', 'interesting', 'origin', 'closely', 'tied', 'tragedy', 'ancient', 'Kingdom', 'Xerxes', 'foreshadow', 'things', 'come', 'Events', 'come', 'head', 'various', 'characters', 'sides', 'now', 'extensive', 'cast', 'prepare', 'fateful', ""'Promised"", 'day', 'where', 'answers', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'revealed', 'Ed', 'Al', 'get', 'separated', 'follow', 'own', 'paths', 'encountering', 'new', 'enemies', 'allies', 'way', 'whole', 'new', 'slew', 'enemies', 'are', 'revealed', 'terrifying', 'form', 'zombie', 'undead', 'warriors', 'midst', 'grand', 'coup', ""d'etat"", 'Amnestris', 'central', 'goverment.What', 'really', 'like', 'series', 'there', 'seem', 'be', 'throwaway', 'characters', 'throwaway', 'plot', 'points', 'Seemingly', 'insignificant', 'events', 'people', 'introduced', 'earlier', 'series', 'have', 'strong', 'impact', 'later', 'events', 'are', 'revealed', 'logical', 'flowing', 'fashion', 'Very', 'little', 'feels', 'forced', 'contrived', 'show', 'so', 'far', 'various', 'disparate', 'plot', 'threads', 'are', 'weaving', 'tight', 'tapestry', 'fits', 'very', 'well', 'Kudos', 'manga', 'author', 'Arakawa', 'creating', 'intricate', 'fantastic', 'story', 'attention', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'anime', 'watchers', 'such', 'Again', 'more', 'fantastic', 'fight', 'scenes', 'great', 'humor', 'graphic', 'well', 'done', 'violence', 'everything', 'done', 'series', 'been', 'elevated', 'level', 'two', 'compared', 'old', 'show.My', 'only', 'negative', 'end', 'volume', 'still', 'have', '11', 'eps', 'go', 'stunning', 'conclusion', 'incredible', 'story', 'writing', 'review', 'final', 'volume', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'out', 'least', '2', 'months', 'pain']",N/A

During the episodes included in this set, some major revelations come out concerning Hohenheim and the plot of Father and the Homunculi.  The setup for a final showdown begins over the course of this box set, but is not resolved by the time you hit episode fifty-two.  It will be interesting to see how the series works at building up to its climax in the next DVD set.  Knowing that there's still twelve episodes remaining, I'm afraid this final showdown is going to end up being stretched out; hopefully I'll be proven wrong when I get a chance to view Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood Part Five.When it comes to DVD extras, the only extra on the first disc are two commentaries.  One of the commentaries is for episode forty (""Homunculus (The Dwarf in the Flask)""), and the other is for episode forty-six (""Looming Shadows"").  There are three extras included on the second disc.  The first feature is labeled as ""Textless Opening Song,"" and this is a textless version of the first opening credits that were included on this set.  The next feature is labeled as ""Textless Closing Song,"" and it features the first ending credits that were included on this set.  The final extra on the disc is trailers.  On this disc are trailers for: Hero Tales, Rideback, Yu Yu Hakusho, Soul Eater, Black Butler, Dragon Ball Z Kai, and D. Gray-man.If you're a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, then this release is worth picking up and adding to your DVD library.

While the original anime series was fantastic in its own right, Brotherhood goes above and beyond what the first series accomplished. Brotherhood is the animated incarnation of the Manga's original story and it is beautifully done. I can't say anymore because I would be spoiling the plot but I will say that this is nearing the end for the Elric Brothers story and their journey is coming to a close.Part 4 is a absolute must buy, and if you already own Part 1-3 then it would be a crime if you didn't buy this DVD. With animes I am very picky with my purchases with the dilemna of watching animes online. But I believe this anime is WELL WORTH your hard earned cash, IT'S THAT GOOD. The writing of the anime is brilliant, the characters are memorable and lovable, the animation is stunning and the voice acting is just perfect in english. I am anxiously waiting for Part which comes out on July 26 and I just can't wait. I am very tempted to watch the rest of the series in japanese online but I believe its worth the wait.

1407532,AFV2584U13XP3,B004GZZGVI,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[4, 5]","The set gives us the episodes 40 through 52 showing us the three groups as they set off for their destinations and agendas to stop the homunculus and their creator known only as ""Father"",  along the way we see as they must struggle to reach their goals and fight their enemies both from the very country they're trying to save and the unknown ultimate plan the homunculus creator has for the people in the country of Amestris.  The new characters we've gotten to see with this new released version of FMA from the previous series a few years ago is great from getting to see Major Armstrong's older sister the General of Briggs to the new Homunculus master,  also very appreciated is the somewhat different stories they made for some of the characters of the series.  Like with the previous series the one who killed Winry Rockbell's parents during the Ishval rebellion was Roy Mustang but in this series the one who did was the character Scar so that was one guilt that Roy Mustang didn't have to carry with him in this version of the series,  and as expected there are other changes in this version of the series as well especially with the relationship and background history between the Elric brothers and their father.  The series animation and soundtrack are of course great and of course the Japanese subbed cast did excellent in their roles though they didn't get the original voice for the character of Winry though the actress who played her still did a great job,  and also even though the voices for the character of Scar and Alphonse in the English dubbed audio were a different actor and actress they too did their roles very well.  The extras aren't much just the usual trailer and textless intro/ending songs though you do get some commentaries on a few episodes.
