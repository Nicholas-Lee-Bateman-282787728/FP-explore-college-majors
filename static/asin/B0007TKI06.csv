This is yet another solid, intelligent, haunting, and tearful documentary from the PBS T.V. show.  It is about the horrific genocide of over 800,000 Tutsis by the Hutus in that country in 1994.  There are two main problems though.  It places too much blame on Bill Clinton and the United States for not taking enough action.  The situation was complex and it wasn't like the U.S. could go in there and act like saviors and heroes, especially not after the debacle in Somalia the year before.  Also, the program does not go too deep into why the tension and conflict existed between the two groups in Rwanda to begin with.",5,"Worth the watch, but places too much blame on the United States.",1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,719,"['Frontline', 'best', 'programs', 'television', ""'Ghosts"", 'Rwanda', 'exception', 'yet', 'solid', 'intelligent', 'haunting', 'tearful', 'documentary', 'PBS', 'T.V', 'show', 'horrific', 'genocide', '800,000', 'Tutsis', 'Hutus', 'country', '1994', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'problems', 'too', 'much', 'blame', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'United', 'States', 'not', 'taking', 'enough', 'action', 'situation', 'was', 'complex', 'was', ""n't"", 'U.S.', 'could', 'go', 'there', 'act', 'saviors', 'heroes', 'especially', 'not', 'debacle', 'Somalia', 'year', 'before', 'Also', 'program', 'not', 'go', 'too', 'deep', 'why', 'tension', 'conflict', 'existed', 'two', 'groups', 'Rwanda', 'begin']",N/A

Pouliot,"[2, 2]","Genocide is not pretty, but is especially ugly when it takes place in the full sight of civilized nations with a supposed historical aversion to the slaughter of innocents. But in 1993, in Rwanda, a genocide of enormous proportions occurred, unstopped by the United Nations, the United States and the rest of the world. ""Ghosts of Rwanda"" tells the story of the Hutu-Tutsi conflict, using archival footage and interviews with a range of participants. The footage is raw, with many images of clusters and fields of butchered human bodies. The interviews with then-UN Secretary Madeleine Albright, UN head Kofi Annan, and UN commander Romeo D'Allaire are fascinating and maddening at the same time. D'Allaire emerges as the story's tragic figure -- the man who knew what was happening and was given no latitude to do much about it. Albright and Annan (and US President Bill Clinton, seen in interviews and footage of his speeches) come across as less sympathetic, and less believable as they attempt to frame their failure to act in political terms. Other voices of those on the ground -- aid workers, reporters and locals on both sides of the divide -- provide the on-the-scenes details of how the horror unfolded.For all the savagery of the genocide, there is a strange emotional detachment about the film. Aside from the aftermath of brutality, there is little to show of the madness and hysteria of the acts as they occurred. ""Ghosts"" does not capture the seething hatred and resentments that drove the murders. This might lead viewers to see Rwandan genocide as just another brutal day in a savage land. Only one victim, Valentina, evinces the lingering terror and betrayal of the period. A 12-year-old at the time, she was hacked and left for dead among the corpses of family and friends in a church used as a refuge. Only one scene -- of a white evacuee being whisked to safety past the faces of equally deserving Rwandans, visually tells the story of the abandonment of Rwanda's Tutsis to their fate.""Ghosts of Rwanda"" is compelling and horrifying but not as moving as it needs to be to provoke the searching for the soul lost to political expediency. If the Holocaust-era slogan ""Never again"" had not lost it meaning in the face in the Rwandan genocide, it might be used as a rallying cry in its aftermath.",4,Murder while the world stood by,1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,2313,"['Genocide', 'not', 'pretty', 'especially', 'ugly', 'when', 'place', 'full', 'sight', 'civilized', 'nations', 'supposed', 'historical', 'aversion', 'slaughter', 'innocents', '1993', 'Rwanda', 'genocide', 'enormous', 'proportions', 'occurred', 'unstopped', 'United', 'Nations', 'United', 'States', 'rest', 'world', 'Ghosts', 'Rwanda', 'story', 'Hutu-Tutsi', 'conflict', 'using', 'archival', 'footage', 'interviews', 'range', 'participants', 'footage', 'raw', 'many', 'images', 'clusters', 'fields', 'butchered', 'human', 'bodies', 'interviews', 'then-UN', 'Secretary', 'Madeleine', 'Albright', 'UN', 'head', 'Kofi', 'Annan', 'UN', 'commander', 'Romeo', ""D'Allaire"", 'are', 'fascinating', 'maddening', 'same', 'time', ""D'Allaire"", 'story', 'tragic', 'figure', 'man', 'who', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'was', 'given', 'latitude', 'do', 'much', 'Albright', 'Annan', 'US', 'President', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'seen', 'interviews', 'footage', 'speeches', 'come', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'less', 'believable', 'attempt', 'frame', 'failure', 'act', 'political', 'terms', 'Other', 'voices', 'ground', 'aid', 'workers', 'reporters', 'locals', 'sides', 'divide', 'provide', 'on-the-scenes', 'details', 'how', 'horror', 'savagery', 'genocide', 'strange', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'film', 'Aside', 'aftermath', 'brutality', 'little', 'show', 'madness', 'hysteria', 'acts', 'occurred', 'Ghosts', 'not', 'capture', 'seething', 'hatred', 'resentments', 'drove', 'murders', 'might', 'lead', 'viewers', 'see', 'Rwandan', 'genocide', 'as', 'just', 'brutal', 'day', 'savage', 'land', 'Only', 'one', 'victim', 'Valentina', 'lingering', 'terror', 'betrayal', 'period', '12-year-old', 'time', 'was', 'hacked', 'left', 'dead', 'corpses', 'family', 'friends', 'church', 'used', 'refuge', 'Only', 'one', 'scene', 'white', 'evacuee', 'being', 'whisked', 'safety', 'equally', 'deserving', 'Rwandans', 'visually', 'story', 'abandonment', 'Rwanda', 'Tutsis', 'fate', 'Ghosts', 'Rwanda', 'compelling', 'horrifying', 'not', 'as', 'moving', 'be', 'provoke', 'searching', 'soul', 'lost', 'political', 'expediency', 'Holocaust-era', 'slogan', 'Never', 'again', 'had', 'not', 'lost', 'meaning', 'face', 'Rwandan', 'genocide', 'might', 'be', 'used', 'rallying', 'cry', 'aftermath']",N/A

889666,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0007TKI06,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","This is one powerful documentary! It tells us so much about the history of the genocide in Rwanda when the long standing conflict and distrust between the Hutus and the Tutsis in Rwanda reached such heights that Hutus (especially Hutu extremists) were out primarily to eliminate the Tutsis, a minority in Rwanda. The flow of the story is very good; this documentary takes two hours to tell the story the way it deserves to be told; we learn much in a straightforward way although I must warn you that some of the archival footage is rather graphic and not suitable for small children or anyone else is who quite sensitive. In addition, the interview footage with Dallaire, Kofe Annan, Madeline Albright and more was absolutely excellent.When the film starts, we see an amount of tension and unrest in Rwanda so great that you know something terrible is certainly about to happen. When someone or some group destroys the president's plane mid-flight by shooting a missile at it, riots and a few other disturbances test just how well the UN peacekeeping force would be able to squash any violence. Of course, the people who wanted to hate and kill got the message that they could do just that and the heartbreaking story begins.Of course, there's much more to the story that just that but I won't spoil it for you just in case you are watching this to learn about the genocide in Rwanda.In addition, this film is an excellent teaching device. There is a link to the PBS website for additional information about this horrific chapter in history. I would have liked an extra bonus feature or two; but that is lacking. However, the film is so good that I can just about ignore this.Some people say that this was a film that pointed the finger of blame more on America than on other countries that also could have done something to help--and they are right! For this I have to take off one star; this DVD gets a four star review.Overall, Frontline: Ghosts of Rwanda tells the story of what truly happened there in such a heartbreaking way that it's impossible to forget this tragedy.

I was shocked and dismayed by some of the cold callous acts perpetrated by western governments during Rwanda's hour of need. I use ""hour of need"" of course as a figment of speech, since this atrocity took place over 100 days.This video clearly documents the events of the Rwandan Genocide. It interviews key players in the international community as well as those who participated in, and were victims of the Genocide. For the most part, the video shows the Genocide from an outside perspective. It volleys back and forth between all of the killing in Rwanda and the international communities response. The footage of death is deeply saddening. I was only uplifted by the few stories of individuals who risked their lives to save some.I would have loved to see them make this into a three part special since it does not give the background into the area or the history that led up to such a tension, nor does it explore the colonial legacy that the Rwandans inherited. I was also disappointed that it didn't cover the events that took place after the RPF won the civil war. Understandably, they could not cover all aspects in one film, but and introduction and a follow-up would really help paint a fuller picture of events.
