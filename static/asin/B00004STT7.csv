Well anyway here's the synopsis to this movie...Wah Ying-Hung, a Chinese hero in the early 20th Century who wields a legendary glowing red blade dubbed The Blood Sword. Born under the Star of Death, Wah Ying-Hung the unfortunate destiny of causing harm to those around him. Thus, he must remain alone and such is his tragic end.Ekin Cheng is one of my favorite actor. However, even he could not save this film(besides the fact that Ekin's hair is exactly like Hero from the comicbook). Despite incredible production values and an epic storyline, 'A Man Called Hero' suffers from too much exposition and not nearly enough actual storytelling. there are too many side-stories and too many characters, and they are all crammed in 105 minutes, and the results, BAD.We meet Hero aka Wah ying-Hung primary enemy played by Francis Ng, in the last parts of the film. And nothing was built to make him and Hero's battle special. And let's talk about the final battle, it was just WAY too much.but don't get me wrong.

549871,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00004STT7,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Almost everyone from ""Stormriders"" is back with a new movie combining special effects, martial arts and history to a new level.The story focuses on a man named Hero who believes that he is born under the ""Star of Death"" (everyone around him dies...friends, loved ones and foes).  One one hand he is fighting for his master, the other is getting revenge for the death of his family and last to find his kidnapped daughter.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't answer all what I mentioned thus perhaps a sequel will be coming out.  As for the movie, I tend to enjoy this movie more than ""Stormriders"".  I actually liked the plot which has a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, like most comic book adaptions with many people, trying to throw many characters in will confuse the viewer.  Personally, some people may need to see this movie more than once to feel comfortable with it.  I enjoyed it a lot and enjoyed the different characters in the movie.  It was like a live movie of ""Tekken"" and ""Soul Blade"" mixed with ""Fist of Legend"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".As for the DVD, this movie has to be bought on DVD.  Although the special cut has been edited for the DVD version (they removed the KKK section, a cemetery section and a few other things), the DVD is the best way to watch this movie because it looks good and sounds good.  Also, the special features available is a better offering than most HK DVD's because they actually subtitled the special 17-minute making of featurette.  Also, the inclusion of three trailers for the movie and more.Watch this movie with an open mind and try to enjoy it.

549873,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00004STT7,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[33, 39]","While I've been a longtime fan of the Woo-influenced Hong Kong action pics and I've been any even longertime (is there such a word?) fan samurai films, I've had a dubious love/hate affair with the more traditional 'martial arts' films where would-be superheroes dance on air whilst wiggling and waggling their magical swords to dice and slice the villains. I've loved CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, and I've meddled with THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR. I don't know. Something about traditional martial arts films have seemed to extremist entertainment to me ... but then along comes A MAN CALLED HERO and I find myself in a curious predicament: I'm hooked.I won't go into a massive rehash of the plot b/c the film does suffer a bit from some of the hallmarks of Hong Kong cinema: there's far too much story to be told in two hours, but, somehow, it all manages to fit together. There are a few plot points (Sword Hua's search for his sister, Hero's love-hate relationship with the Elements, Shadow's real intentions, etc.) that don't get enough screen time -- surprisingly -- but sacrifices were made, and what's left for the story is more than enough to chew.This film is dazzling to watch, and I think it so for a variety of reasons. It takes the traditional martial arts formula of the mystical hero, and it turns the film upside down to avoid going overboard in every way possible. Also, it strives to be much more of a contemporary 'period piece' -- set in what one could guess is America, circa 1920/1930 (I honestly don't remember that a date was mentioned) ... a creative choice that does give the principal characters far more of a 'superhero' feel and less of battling martial artists. That and EVERYTHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE WRITTEN ABOUT THE FILM'S CLIMAX ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY MUST BE BELIEVED! While there are a few parts of the Statue's final battle that are hard to swallow, it's easy to look the other way and just be dazzled in the way many other blockbuster films have tried to do.A MAN CALLED HERO (not to be confused with Jet Li's HERO) is a remarkable find, and it's a remarkable piece of work from a man called Andrew Lau.This is a definite owner.

549876,A36H16ZJXUIMZG,B00004STT7,"Gene Cisco ""Moon Man""","[0, 0]","I was drawn to this film because of the body of work of Andrew Lau, without the knowledge of the comic book source. For the most part I was impressed by the charisma of Ekin Cheng and the martial arts scenes that went from exciting to the supernatural. Sometimes, they entered the domain of ""Crouching Tiger"" or ""Iron Monkey,"" which is not bad company considering the source material. It was wonderful to move the story through multi-generations with consistent believability before setting in to stereotypical, racist cardboard American figures with no heart or soul akin to those found in dated ""Kung-Fu"" TV episodes. Setting that aside, whenever the action came back to early New York city scenes the film finds enough realism to rise with your expectations. It is too bad that the script writer had obviously not seen Boorman's ""Excalibur,"" which had its magical sword moving the storyline more thoroughly. Here, the red burning sword is introduced early and then shows up later without explanation, which means the viewer must read the comic first. The ultimate fight on the Statue of Liberty seems to have been attached to impress, though it disappoints as an intrusive futuristic appendage rather than as a flowing extension of the early 20s scenes.  For Shu Qi, her supporting role is well-tuned, sympathetic and brief. Any moment away from the stereotypes, the film rises. I would rate the film higher if the script had the guts to avoid the special effects finale, an obvious appeal to court the looming U.S. market. The fine acting could have risen to the challenge against a mere matte background (a la Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"")saving fantasy animation dollars more wisely spent on polishing the script.",3,A Hero Fights Belief,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,1723,"['was', 'drawn', 'film', 'body', 'work', 'Andrew', 'Lau', 'knowledge', 'comic', 'book', 'source', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'impressed', 'charisma', 'Ekin', 'Cheng', 'martial', 'arts', 'scenes', 'went', 'exciting', 'supernatural', 'Sometimes', 'entered', 'domain', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Iron', 'Monkey', 'not', 'bad', 'company', 'considering', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'wonderful', 'move', 'story', 'multi-generations', 'consistent', 'believability', 'setting', 'stereotypical', 'racist', 'cardboard', 'American', 'figures', 'heart', 'soul', 'akin', 'found', 'dated', 'Kung-Fu', 'TV', 'episodes', 'Setting', 'aside', 'whenever', 'action', 'came', 'back', 'early', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'film', 'enough', 'realism', 'rise', 'expectations', 'too', 'bad', 'script', 'writer', 'had', 'obviously', 'not', 'seen', 'Boorman', 'Excalibur', 'had', 'magical', 'sword', 'moving', 'storyline', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'Here', 'red', 'burning', 'sword', 'introduced', 'early', 'then', 'up', 'later', 'explanation', 'viewer', 'must', 'read', 'comic', 'first', 'ultimate', 'fight', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'have', 'been', 'attached', 'impress', 'intrusive', 'futuristic', 'appendage', 'rather', 'flowing', 'extension', 'early', '20s', 'scenes', 'Shu', 'Qi', 'supporting', 'role', 'well-tuned', 'sympathetic', 'brief', 'moment', 'away', 'stereotypes', 'film', 'would', 'rate', 'film', 'higher', 'script', 'had', 'guts', 'avoid', 'special', 'effects', 'finale', 'obvious', 'appeal', 'court', 'looming', 'U.S.', 'market', 'fine', 'acting', 'could', 'have', 'risen', 'challenge', 'mere', 'matte', 'background', 'la', 'Hitchcock', 'North', 'Northwest', 'saving', 'fantasy', 'animation', 'dollars', 'more', 'wisely', 'spent', 'polishing', 'script']",A Man Called Hero: Special Cut

CGI/computer-generated special effects are now prevalent in films from all over.  Are the effects enough to justify the purchase of this  film?Beyond the effects, there is a descent main plot.  However, the  film suffers from sub-plots that end too suddenly.  In addition, the main  story ends, to be continued in a sequel.  While this is not surprising, I  felt that the movie ended abruptly.  It may sound confusing, but if you  watch &quot;A Man Called Hero&quot;, you'll understand.With the growing  popularity of CGI, I hope that moviemakers will still maintain some  credible fight choreagraphy within the sequence.

549886,APRNS6DB68LLV,B00004STT7,"Rob Slaven ""slavenrm@gmail. com""","[6, 8]","I picked this movie because it looked lonely on Amazon Instant Watch.  At first I had my doubts but by 20 minutes in I was glad that I did.So this is a multi-generational revenge/drama/romance film.  Some innocent people are killed, a son goes in search of revenge in America.  We don't hear much about it until his own son shows up in America almost two decades later.  Eventually fighting and the standard expected stuff ensues.On the positive side, this is a martial arts film rife with all the standard soft of action you'd expect in such.  It should be noted that this is primarily a family drama and not all that much action.  I'd say it's 80% family drama and 20% combat.  it's really, really cheesy combat but combat none the less.  The real joy of this film comes from seeing all the stereotypical portrayals of Americans as viewed from the standpoint of the Chinese.  They're not all QUITE walking around in spurs and chaps but they certainly do dress alike.To the negative, some of the scenes are just ill-constructed.  I'm talking Power Rangers bad here.  Early on we get a glowing-red obviously plastic sword that really steals a scene or two and it is an effort to suspend disbelief.  Other fighting scenes are similarly laughable but that's all part of the fun.In summary, this is a good one to sit down with and not take too seriously early on.  The story's not half bad; you just have to decide to focus on the parts that amuse you.PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews.

Along the way, he befriends a Buddhist monk, who admires his devotion and sense of honor. Falsely accused of murder at the camp, Hero is forced to flee yet again.

With some unforeseen consequences.""A Man Called Hero"" has some excellent special effects, martial arts fans will enjoy. For instance: there is a scene where Hero and the villian are battling on top of the Statue of Liberty which was really breathtaking. There were also several really cool scenes where Hero is battling in the city as well.What really prevented me from giving this movie a five star rating was the choppy plot, and the way it was narrated. Half of the movie is told in 'real time' and the other half seems to be relayed by Hero's friend Shadow. The movie jumps from present to past, without much sense, and this was distracting. Also, the plot seemed to meander a bit, with Hero just taking what life dished out, and never doing much of anything. On the good side, Ekin Cheng was absolutely WONDERFUL as Hero, lending the role the fire it needed to breath life into an otherwise cardboard stiff character.

549889,AHY2KG32696ES,B00004STT7,SL,"[6, 7]","Having finally seen &quot;A Man Called Hero&quot; after reading endless debate as to its entertainment value, I must say that overall, it was an enjoyable film. Granted there were enough flaws to fill a black hole, but it still had some excellent production values. As Andrew Lau's follow-up to &quot;Stormriders,&quot; it's hard to not to make any comparisons when many of the cast and crew worked on both movies. While the special effects didn't break any new ground, the situations were more far-fetched and befitting a comic book.As the movie was made from another comic book by Ma Wing Shing (I haven't read any of them), it had more of a comic book feel. That is both its strength and weakness. The pacing was more fluid by sacrificing characters, reducing them stereotypes. Thankfully there was less brooding from the main characters than in &quot;Stormriders.&quot; Good guys were all morally righteous and the bad guys were all venal and heinous, except for Hsu Chi, who was spared by Hero during one of the fights between Hero and the Japanese ninjas. The stereotyping of the &quot;foreigners&quot; was particularly painful, due to the black and white depictions and the contrived plot. The narrative technique of using flashbacks to tell the story grew tiresome quickly. What saved the movie was the pacing and the interspersed action sequences, but shortchanging the characters into cardboard cut-outs. Regardless, it's always good to see Yuen Biao, as limited as his role was in this outing.The finale duel at the Statue of Liberty is totally outrageous, but it doesn't measure up to the fight where Hero and Shadow go against the Japanese ninjas. Although it's apparent that the actors are in front of a blue or green screen, you soon forget when the action goes overboard.&quot;A Man Called Hero&quot; is something that you can watch during a lazy Saturday or Sunday matinee, when you don't want to strain your brain and can suspend your disbelief with more abandon. The surprising roles were filled by Ken Lo and Francis Ng. Ken Lo seems to have broken out of his bad-guy image of being only a bruiser, playing a monk in this flick (he must have a better agent these days because he seems to be in a lot more than just Jackie Chan movies), and Francis Ng, becasue I always notice that he's left-handed (strange way of identification, I know), and that he has become more of an actor and less of a snarling reactionist. Ekin Cheng appears to have only one expression: stolid and emotionless. He's gotta do something with his hair and the same coif in all his movies. The &quot;Young and Dangerous&quot; look is way over.
