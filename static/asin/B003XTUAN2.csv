1371180,A2JBVRCJ8VS7PQ,B003XTUAN2,Jerry (Celil) Parker,"[0, 1]","Lucas Cruickshank, the eponymous protagonist of ""Fred, the Movie"" as a teenager is a boy of irresistibly epicene beauty. It is not often, however, in this madcap movie, that there is much of any real opportunity to appreciate suchlike of his pleasing physical assets, except for the rarest moments of smiling calm. That is because the character Fred is in a state of hyper-active, utter mania almost all of the time, grimacing, bounding about, and screeching seemingly uncontrollably. I can understand how many viewers who have commented on this film detest the entire thing as rubbish. However, if one takes the film on its own farcical terms, it is quite endearing. Lucas Cruikshank, if his voice is anything in reality as it is in the movie in which he plays this crazed fifteen-years-old junior high school boy, has yet, so far as his voice is concerned, to complete puberty, though he looks decidedly adolescent enough. More likely, the youthful actor's voice has undergone sonic manipulation. The kid certainly knows how to do frolic acrobatically, leaping and dancing to unbelievably energetic effect!I watched this oddity in a state of attempted disbelief, having to turn down the volume when Fred/Lucas' screeching became too ear-splitting. Elsewhere there are accounts of the zanily exaggerated antics through which the movie's plot (such as it is) puts Fred, so I won't bother here to do the same. It is not a film that I would want to view often, maybe once or twice more during the length of life left to me. Despite that, this movie has a maniacally energetic, hysterical charm all of its own. Anyway, there are few motion pictures of its kind, beyond those of the likes starring, variously, Abbott and Costello, Jerry Lewis, and the Keystone Cops, or maybe occasionally early Eddie Cantor or Marx Brothers, in the company of some of whom, however, it probably is improper to place Cruikshank; maybe he is no more than a screaming human equivalent of the advertising world's animated ""Energizer Bunny"".

Lukas Cruikshank (guy who created and plays FR3D) first did the character in youtube videos.  He had some success with this and was even featured on iCarly...Interesting bit that, FAKE internet personalities featuring a REAL internet personality!The character of Fred is supposed to be manic and annoying.  Some of his bits are funnier than others and it surprised us that the iCarly episode seemed to highlight some of his LEAST funny material.As to the movie, we started it not expecting much and even thinking we might have to stop it if it was too bad.  That said we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves ALL enjoying ourselves.  There are LOADS of funny bits that also play on real personal, social and psychological experiences.  For an example, Fred doesn't know his father, is a rather weak, shy and awkward person; so he imagines that his father ""Father Figglehorn"" is a big strong and bold wrestler who will simultaneously give him advice to make him try while also caring and being nurturing.  This character was SURPRISINGLY well played by wrestler John Cena!  There are loads of laugh out loud bits including Fred thinking that Pomerians are squirrels!!If you can watch this movie without being impressed by the talents of this young man than you must be a bitter shell of a person!  The sheer imagination and talent that makes it possible to entertain both adults AND children without getting too silly, nonsensical, lewd or crass is both rare and refreshing.For a SMALL example of this guys talent compare the character of FR3D with D3RF a cool, laid back rocker type!

The first time I saw it, I thought it was annoying and dumb.  My kids loved it, so we watched it again.  The second time, I laughed at a couple of things.  Then I realized the more I watched it, the funnier it got, and now I love this movie.  What were annoying and dumb elements in this movie has turned into the exact reasons why I now watch it over and over--even when the kids are asleep.First, Fred overreacts to everything.  An example is when he sees an Asian family who just moved into Judy's house, he assumes she's been kidnapped by Asian people and calls 911.  Then when he finds out Judy moved, he practically destroys the living room but afterwards, he calmly cleans it all up. Hey, at least he cleans up his messes.Second, he imagines all this stuff of how he's getting even with someone or getting Judy to fall in love with him.  At first, I found these jarring from the flow of the movie, but now they're just hilarious because what he imagines is a lot different from what actually happens.  So the contrast works great, but I think you have to be used to it in order to fully enjoy it.Third, I love the jokes, such as ""It's Judy.  She's been kidnapped...by kidnappers.""  These are corny but they're also funny. And for some reason, the fact that he thinks a dog is a squirrel is hilarious.  I mean, I know we're supposed to think ""boy, is he dumb"" but the humor in it is actually clever from a comedic viewpoint.Fourth, in the end, you can't help but root for Fred.  He means well and has an innocent charm about him.  Sure, he's hyper and has the high-pitch voice, but he's got a good heart and wouldn't do anything to hurt anyone.So while I didn't like the movie at all when I first watched it, it grew on me, and the fact that my kids love it and I don't feel like I have to fast forward through objectionable parts (like I do with some movies), I'm very happy we found this movie.

So maybe it's weird for a 28 year old while male to enjoy this movie, but I did! It reminds me of someone I work with! I saw it on tv, so I can imagine it's better on DVD. It's sweet and funny. It's about a high school kid with a high-pitched voice going after the love-of-his-life, and getting caught up in funny situations along the way. I don't find his voice annoying, but others might. The actos is really good with the facial expressions to match what Fred is feeling. If you don't know what Fred is, I suggest some youtube research. I cannot wait to buy this on DVD!",5,Long-Live Fred!!,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,673,"['was', 'late', 'whole', 'Fred', 'Phenomenon', 'saw', 'special', 'tv', 'was', 'hooked', 'So', 'maybe', 'weird', '28', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'did', 'someone', 'work', 'saw', 'tv', 'can', 'imagine', 'better', 'DVD', 'sweet', 'funny', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'high-pitched', 'voice', 'going', 'love-of-his-life', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'funny', 'situations', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'voice', 'annoying', 'others', 'might', 'actos', 'really', 'good', 'facial', 'expressions', 'match', 'what', 'Fred', 'feeling', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Fred', 'suggest', 'youtube', 'research', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'buy', 'DVD']",N/A
