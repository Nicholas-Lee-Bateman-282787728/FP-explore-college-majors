The unfortunate part is that the production quality is poor. And it was done after the second season so some of the cast members are now different. Fun to watch and see the cast as themselves rather than the shows characters.,3,For fans of Castle,1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,319,"['information', 'documentary', 'was', 'interesting', 'good', 'are', 'real', 'fan', 'Castle', 'unfortunate', 'part', 'production', 'quality', 'poor', 'was', 'done', 'second', 'season', 'so', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'now', 'different', 'Fun', 'watch', 'see', 'cast', 'rather', 'shows', 'characters']",Castle:  Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center

Well, how about an onstage panel discussion featuring the cast & creator of CASTLE, courtesy of the Paley Center for Media? This very entertaining talkfest took place on March 16, 2010, sometime around CASTLE's second season, and here's the roll call: actors Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic, Molly Quinn, Jon Huertas, Tamala Jones, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Susan Sullivan, and Seamus Dever, with producer & series creator Andrew W. Marlowe and executive producer Rob Bowman. If you're not a fan of CASTLE, I don't know that you'll want to plonk down $19 for this DVD. But if you ARE a fan, oboy... For 55 minutes, these folks regale you with their good group chemistry and their behind the scenes anecdotes. Turns out, Nathan Fillion really is that impish. Stana Katic in real life is just as lovely (and a bit shy). Molly Quinn, she's adorable.Tom Bergeron from DANCING WITH THE STARS makes for a consummate moderator (he also plays a corpse in the CASTLE episode ""The Late Shaft""). Bergeron effortlessly goes with the flow and is adept at asking insightful questions. He engages the panel for the first 14 minutes of the DVD and then turns the Q & A over to the audience (not that he ever does stop engaging the cast, but, as mentioned, he does it in the flow). I'm a big fan of CASTLE and so was very curious about the cast & crew's observations and responses to the questions posed them. That they answered them with humor and playfulness and with frankness and good detail only made me a bigger fan.One of the funniest and most touching sequences concerns then 16-year-old Molly Quinn who talks about her real-life father-daughter relationship with Nathan Fillion, except first she hilariously shoots herself in the foot when describing her first impression of the first script: ""I thought the script was great... I thought it was good... but it was, you know, it was TV."" The reaction from the rest of the cast is priceless.I really enjoyed the Stana Katic-oriented moments, Stana who may or may not have been trying to hide behind her hair. Naturally, there was gonna be mention of the show's primary engine, namely the tension between Castle and Beckett and the importance of milking that for as long as possible. At some point during this topic, Stana unexpectedly purrs: ""I think there's nothing sexier than swordplay."" (And then you need to check out Fillion's reaction). Later, Stana is asked to share her thoughts on her fans who call themselves the ""Stanatics."" Some time after that, to Stana's shock, Fillion breezily divulges some of the sly methods employed by the cast to memorize their lines. Fillion, straight-faced, pointedly mentions the folders which Stana seems to carry all the time.Still, for my money, the best reveal is Fillion's smug confession: ""Castle twitters -- and he follows ME!""",5,the 411 on Stanatics and sexy swordplays and the sharing of Twitter followers,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,2928,"['Ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'CASTLE', 'Even', 'are', 'Nikki', 'Heat', 'there', 'now', 'even', 'Derrick', 'Storm', 'comic', 'book', 'Well', 'how', 'onstage', 'panel', 'discussion', 'featuring', 'cast', 'creator', 'CASTLE', 'courtesy', 'Paley', 'Center', 'Media', 'very', 'entertaining', 'talkfest', 'took', 'place', 'March', '16', '2010', 'sometime', 'CASTLE', 'second', 'season', 'here', 'roll', 'call', 'actors', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Stana', 'Katic', 'Molly', 'Quinn', 'Jon', 'Huertas', 'Tamala', 'Jones', 'Ruben', 'Santiago-Hudson', 'Susan', 'Sullivan', 'Seamus', 'Dever', 'producer', 'series', 'creator', 'Andrew', 'W.', 'Marlowe', 'executive', 'producer', 'Rob', 'Bowman', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'CASTLE', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'want', 'plonk', 'down', '19', 'DVD', 'ARE', 'fan', 'oboy', '55', 'minutes', 'folks', 'regale', 'good', 'group', 'chemistry', 'scenes', 'anecdotes', 'out', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'really', 'impish', 'Stana', 'Katic', 'real', 'life', 'just', 'as', 'lovely', 'bit', 'shy', 'Molly', 'Quinn', 'adorable.Tom', 'Bergeron', 'DANCING', 'WITH', 'THE', 'STARS', 'consummate', 'moderator', 'also', 'corpse', 'CASTLE', 'episode', 'Late', 'Shaft', 'Bergeron', 'effortlessly', 'flow', 'adept', 'asking', 'insightful', 'questions', 'panel', 'first', '14', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'then', 'Q', 'A', 'audience', 'not', 'ever', 'stop', 'engaging', 'cast', 'mentioned', 'flow', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'CASTLE', 'so', 'was', 'very', 'curious', 'cast', 'crew', 'observations', 'responses', 'questions', 'posed', 'answered', 'humor', 'playfulness', 'frankness', 'good', 'detail', 'only', 'made', 'bigger', 'fan.One', 'funniest', 'most', 'touching', 'sequences', 'concerns', 'then', '16-year-old', 'Molly', 'Quinn', 'who', 'talks', 'real-life', 'father-daughter', 'relationship', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'first', 'hilariously', 'shoots', 'foot', 'when', 'describing', 'first', 'impression', 'first', 'script', 'thought', 'script', 'was', 'great', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'know', 'was', 'TV', 'reaction', 'rest', 'cast', 'priceless.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Stana', 'Katic-oriented', 'moments', 'Stana', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'hide', 'hair', 'Naturally', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'mention', 'show', 'primary', 'engine', 'namely', 'tension', 'Castle', 'Beckett', 'importance', 'milking', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'point', 'topic', 'Stana', 'unexpectedly', 'think', 'nothing', 'sexier', 'swordplay', 'then', 'need', 'check', 'out', 'Fillion', 'reaction', 'Later', 'Stana', 'asked', 'share', 'thoughts', 'fans', 'who', 'call', 'Stanatics', 'time', 'Stana', 'shock', 'Fillion', 'breezily', 'sly', 'methods', 'employed', 'cast', 'memorize', 'lines', 'Fillion', 'straight-faced', 'pointedly', 'mentions', 'folders', 'Stana', 'carry', 'time.Still', 'money', 'best', 'reveal', 'Fillion', 'smug', 'confession', 'Castle', 'twitters', 'ME']",Castle:  Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center

1396413,A3UVGHUDOY77YR,B004CYF7D0,MissPammy,"[1, 1]","I think all Castle fans want to find out what the actors are like behind the scenes, but this kind of a venue does not really promote that type of exchange very well.  The actors are all sitting in chairs on a stage, which did not appear to be that comfortable. Answering off-the-cuff questions is a bit awkward and not that enlightening about what the actors are really like.  I would rather see a session where the actors, writer, and producer had the reins instead of the audience and were not lined up in chairs like puppets, so that they could just relax and improvise--maybe come up with their own way of showing us who they are.  I watched the whole video but for me it never really took off.  Moreover, while I often pay $1.99 to watch a two-hour movie on Amazon Instant Video, the same price for one that is under an hour and not really very entertaining seems like less than a bargain to me.  Overall, I would not recommend this to any of my friends that are major Castle fans like I am.  I love the show, but this was rather tedious to watch.  Actors are real people; they are not necessarily always ""on,"" and putting them in this kind of awkward situation does not bring out their natural exuberance or wit.  Even Nathan Fillion couldn't rescue it despite his megawatt charm.  Susan Sullivan told a cute anecdote that I enjoyed, but it was not enough to make up for the rest of the footage.  I would say go ahead and see it if you just can't pass up the chance, but be prepared that it isn't too scintillating.  I would rather spend my money buying Castle episodes, which I have already done, and I watch those over and over and enjoy them every time.  I imagine it was exciting for the people who were actually in the studio audience at the time this was shot and who had the opportunity to ask questions, but viewing it was sort of academic.  I think every actor on the show is far, FAR more interesting than this video made them out to be.",2,Not really that exciting,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,1954,"['think', 'Castle', 'fans', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'actors', 'are', 'scenes', 'kind', 'venue', 'not', 'really', 'promote', 'type', 'exchange', 'very', 'well', 'actors', 'are', 'sitting', 'chairs', 'stage', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'comfortable', 'Answering', 'off-the-cuff', 'questions', 'bit', 'awkward', 'not', 'enlightening', 'what', 'actors', 'are', 'really', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'session', 'where', 'actors', 'writer', 'producer', 'had', 'reins', 'instead', 'audience', 'were', 'not', 'lined', 'up', 'chairs', 'puppets', 'could', 'just', 'relax', 'improvise', 'maybe', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'way', 'showing', 'who', 'are', 'watched', 'whole', 'video', 'never', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'Moreover', 'often', 'pay', '1.99', 'watch', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'same', 'price', 'one', 'hour', 'not', 'really', 'very', 'entertaining', 'less', 'bargain', 'Overall', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'friends', 'are', 'major', 'Castle', 'fans', 'am', 'love', 'show', 'was', 'rather', 'tedious', 'watch', 'Actors', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'always', 'putting', 'kind', 'awkward', 'situation', 'not', 'bring', 'out', 'natural', 'exuberance', 'wit', 'Even', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'could', ""n't"", 'rescue', 'megawatt', 'charm', 'Susan', 'Sullivan', 'told', 'cute', 'anecdote', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'rest', 'footage', 'would', 'say', 'go', 'ahead', 'see', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'chance', 'be', 'prepared', ""n't"", 'too', 'scintillating', 'would', 'rather', 'spend', 'money', 'buying', 'Castle', 'episodes', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'time', 'imagine', 'was', 'exciting', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'studio', 'audience', 'time', 'was', 'shot', 'who', 'had', 'opportunity', 'ask', 'questions', 'viewing', 'was', 'sort', 'academic', 'think', 'actor', 'show', 'far', 'FAR', 'more', 'interesting', 'video', 'made', 'out', 'be']",Castle:  Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center
