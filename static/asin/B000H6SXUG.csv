1010599,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B000H6SXUG,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 0]","Claire Parker is having a terrible day.  After getting off work from her overnight shift at the convenience store, she heads outside to wait for her boyfriend Jimmy, but when his truck pulls up, it's not Jimmy behind the wheel.  Duke introduces himself, says he works with Jimmy in the salvage yard.  Jimmy couldn't make it, wanted Duke to give Claire a ride.Um, ok, Claire says, and gets in the truck.  Duke is creeping her out on the drive, but he gets her to her house and she runs inside and locks the door.  Duke knocks, says she dropped her earring in the truck, he'll just leave it on the porch.  The truck drives away and Claire, with the door chained, stretches and strains until she reaches the earring.  Once the door is closed and locked again, she turns toward the kitchen, and freezes.  The back door is opened.Duke appears, knocks Claire down, punches her repeatedly, drags her bloody and screaming into the basement.  Then Claire wakes up back at the convenience store.  She gets off work from her overnight shift, then heads outside to wait for her boyfriend Jimmy.  Jimmy picks her up and Claire tells him about the weird dream she had.I had a weird dream, too, Jimmy says.  I dreamed we were having a threesome with your friend Jen.  That's weird, right?  Surely she wouldn't go for it.  You think she'd go for it?  You should ask her.Claire ignores Jimmy, preoccupied with how intense her dream had been.  So intense, she spends the next couple of days feeling like she's being watched, or like there's something in the house with her.  She keeps seeing Duke in odd places around town.  Maybe, she begins to suspect, what she experienced wasn't a dream after all.  But if it wasn't, how did she get back to the store?  Then one night, Duke attacks her in the store.  She gouges out his eyes and he stops in his attack and says, ""Not yet,"" the disappears into the night.  The police arrive and Claire gives a statement.  Except...well, the police are a little confused because, not only does the surveillance tape show Claire fighting with no one, but Duke Desmond is dead.  The police killed him just a week earlier.Jeff and Josh Crook's 2006 film SALVAGE was a wonderful surprise of a movie.  I bought it for $5 on a 4-pack of horror movies which also included Tobe Hooper's MORTUARY, Billy Zane's MEMORY, and the godawful BLOODY MARY.  Considering the other movies on this set received an average of 1.6 stars by me, I was expecting more of the same when I sat down to watch SALVAGE.  At only 79 minutes and starring no one I'd ever heard of before, this was the sleeper hit of the set.Not only was the story engaging, but the acting was pretty good, coupled with a really well-written script.Lauren Currie Lewis as Claire was up to the task of carrying this movie.  A modern day Nancy Thompson, Claire navigates her weird dreamlike world with equal amounts of caution and determination.  Cody Darbe as Jimmy is just along for the ride, trying to enjoy life, but also trying to be a supportive boyfriend when his girlfriend starts having her breakdown.  Chris Ferry plays Duke Desmond and he's definitely a creeper, but closer to the Buffalo Bill end of the spectrum.The Crook brothers (I'm guessing they're brothers) have an excellent grasp of building tension and using the camera to further the story without the need for too much expository dialogue.Overall, SALVAGE was an excellent movie that kept me interested from start to finish.  If any negatives could be found, it would only be through my own carelessness.  When I'm about to review a movie, I like to read up a little on it first, get some behind the scenes info to help focus my attention on the details.  I never read the plot, though.  But in this case, scrolling down the wikipedia page, my eyes fell upon the last couple of lines in the synopsis, which, unfortunately, gave away the ending.  That's not always a bad thing, but with a movie like this, it diminishes the impact just a bit because SALVAGE fits into a very distinct category of movie that, were I to even name a few similar movies, would automatically give away too much.  Suffice it to say, I wish I hadn't seen those few lines of plot description and had, instead, been able to enjoy this ride on my own.But either way, knowing the ending beforehand has nothing at all to do with the script, the acting, the direction, the camera work, any of that (and I can't forget the soundtrack, provided by Ohio band Devola, which complimented the movie ways unimaginable in something this cheap.  I have to see if they have any albums available!).  The fact remains, SALVAGE was a surprisingly good movie and well worth the time I spent on it.  I wish I could say it's sure to result in a wonderful career for it's writers/directors and it's star.  Unfortunately I have a feeling most people will see it in its association with the other three movies on that ""horror collector's set"" and dismiss it as cheap=bad.  Normally I wouldn't argue that point, but in this case I have to.  SALVAGE may have been made for only $25,000, it may have been shot on digital video, and it may have starred a bunch of unknowns, but the end result easily transcends genre and what we have in the end is just a very good movie that I would gladly watch again.  I can't say that about the films on that set.",4,Salvage,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,5333,"['Claire', 'Parker', 'having', 'terrible', 'day', 'getting', 'off', 'work', 'overnight', 'shift',

Jake Kincaid, Jack of...","[3, 4]","I actually have owned this movie for about six months and have never watched it; it's on a four pack I purchased for an entirely different film, and I honestly never paid much attention to this feature.  The other night, I was bored, and thought I'd try something new, so I gave this one a shot......I have to say, I'm kicking myself for not watching it sooner.There's plenty of plot synopsis' on these pages already, and it's really something that you need to experience without foreknowledge, so I'm not going to go there.  I am going to say that I found this little indie flick very impressive for the budget (or lack thereof) it had.  I found the acting, especially for an outing such as this, to be convincing and powerful.  Lauren Lewis, as our protagonist, was convincing in her depiction of both teenaged defiance and equally so in her portrayal of fear and confusion, without being over the top.  The villian of our piece, in my mind, was chilling; he was a rather affable guy, normal in appearance; and while he was perhaps a bit odd in personality, there is nothing overtly 'sinister' about him in the beginning...much in the vein of a Norman Bates (and Chris Ferry, in my opinion, channeled a young Bill Paxton in his performance).The plot, while not entirely original, had enough of a new spin to make it enjoyable.  It was well-paced and the clues to the mystery were subtle yet noticeable; some images and effects were genuinely spooky, and they were fitting and well-done considering the monetary constraints.A lot of people seem confused with the ending; I myself, whilst I wasn't entirely correct in my deductions, found the ending understandable and satisfying.For a good, spooky little movie that gets you thinking, ""Salvage"" is a good investment for the price you pay...fans of indie horror should definitely give this one a chance...I'm happy that I did.",4,"""The only thing that's real is what you feel...""",1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,1876,"['actually', 'have', 'owned', 'movie', 'six', 'months', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'four', 'pack', 'purchased', 'entirely', 'different', 'film', 'honestly', 'never', 'paid', 'much', 'attention', 'feature', 'other', 'night', 'was', 'bored', 'thought', ""'d"", 'try', 'something', 'new', 'gave', 'one', 'shot', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'kicking', 'not', 'watching', 'plenty', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'pages', 'already', 'really', 'something', 'need', 'experience', 'foreknowledge', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'there', 'am', 'going', 'say', 'found', 'little', 'indie', 'flick', 'very', 'impressive', 'budget', 'lack', 'thereof', 'had', 'found', 'acting', 'especially', 'outing', 'such', 'be', 'convincing', 'powerful', 'Lauren', 'Lewis', 'protagonist', 'was', 'convincing', 'depiction', 'teenaged', 'defiance', 'equally', 'so', 'portrayal', 'fear', 'confusion', 'being', 'top', 'villian', 'piece', 'mind', 'was', 'chilling', 'was', 'rather', 'affable', 'guy', 'normal', 'appearance', 'was', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'odd', 'personality', 'nothing', 'overtly', ""'sinister"", 'beginning', 'much', 'vein', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'Chris', 'Ferry', 'opinion', 'channeled', 'young', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'performance', '.The', 'plot', 'not', 'entirely', 'original', 'had', 'enough', 'new', 'spin', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'well-paced', 'clues', 'mystery', 'were', 'subtle', 'yet', 'noticeable', 'images', 'effects', 'were', 'genuinely', 'spooky', 'were', 'fitting', 'well-done', 'considering', 'monetary', 'constraints.A', 'lot', 'people', 'seem', 'confused', 'ending', 'whilst', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'correct', 'deductions', 'found', 'ending', 'understandable', 'satisfying.For', 'good', 'spooky', 'little', 'movie', 'thinking', 'Salvage', 'good', 'investment', 'price', 'pay', 'fans', 'indie', 'horror', 'should', 'definitely', 'give', 'one', 'chance', ""'m"", 'happy', 'did']",Salvage

The main character has either been killed or is having some serious nightmares or delusions as she is being haunted by a serial killer.  In fact the first two acts are fairly captivating and I was thinking Salvage was on its way to a solid 4 star rating.  Things get a bit dicey and meandering as the films ventures into Jacob's Ladder or Sixth Sense territory.  Unlike those superior films, the writers seem to run out of clever ideas and while resolution is given at the very end, I found the climax somewhat unsatisfying.

I say possibly because she wakes up and it was all a dream' Or was it?

Now since Claire wakes up after repeatedly being killed and clearly every scene is clearly a dream or alternate reality; I simply just stopped caring what happened to Claire and started wondering what lame twist at the end was going to pull this together.I was rooting for a s&eacute;ance (which honestly could have made sense) but instead got one of those too obvious by half surprise endings (Think The Village or Below). Yup, the film collapses faster than Donnie Darko's directors cut. All the great twist endings in horror movies such as The Sixth Sense, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, or even Happy Birthday to Me worked because the audience was simply not expecting it. (Heck even the canoe ending in the original Friday the 13th was worth a jolt)Salvage, on the other hand, screams twist ending with every scene change. Other nagging faults is the one note piano soundtrack, (Though the featured songs were decent), the obvious time padding (Claire doing the dishes, Claire's mother's subplots), and the way Claire says ""hello is anyone there"" every time she thinks there is a serial killer around like she was playing some sort of masochistic game of Marco Polo.In addition, some of the secondary acting roles (In particular Claire's mother played by Maureen Olander, who resembles a Mary Kay zombie) show the first time actor, low budget roots.Salvage is both too clever by half and not nearly clever enough, it does keep your interest; if only to see how they are going to fix this mess.

1010616,AQ2UN38CMK119,B000H6SXUG,P. Mann,"[48, 54]","Kudos to Jeff and Josh Crook, who wrote and directed this taught little (80-minute) thriller and to the cast, especially Lauren Currie Lewis as the frequent victim and Chris Ferry as the killer.The plot of ""Salvage"" is fairly simple, largely because the film can be described asGroundhog Dayin hell. The film begins when Claire (Lewis), a clerk at a gas station, ends her shift at the station. Her boyfriend is supposed to pick her up to take her to her college classes, but a man named Duke (Ferry) shows up instead, claiming that Claire's boyfriend asked him to pick her up. She accepts the ride and is soon murdered. Almost immediately, she is back at the gas station, ending her shift once again. The gas station here plays essentially the same role ""I Got You Babe"" played in ""Groundhog Day."" In other words, the cycle is fairly simple: end shift at the gas station, get murdered, repeat.While Claire tries to figure out why Duke keeps killing her and what, if anything, she can do to stop it, she has to deal with a boyfriend who is more interested in getting Claire's friend to join him and Claire in bed than in listening to her problems--even though he seems to be murdered rather frequently himself. The difference, it seems, is that he does not remember his various deaths. Unlike ""Groundhog Day"" and the similar (and, in my opinion, better than ""Groundhog Day"")12:01, ""Salvage"" does not repeat the same scene every time. Yes, Claire ends up dying again and again, but the world is different each time. The second time, for instance, it really is her boyfriend who picks her up.Dealing with a world in which only her imminent murder seems certain, Claire tries to enlist others' help, but without much success. The police seem to be little help, and Claire's mother is, in a word, creepy. The clues, however, are there, and the ending pays off by tying the film together (in a montage reminiscent ofThe Sixth SenseorThe Illusionist)--at least for those who think about the film carefully enough.""Salvage"" is an independent film, with all that phrase connotes. Those who insist on glossy, high-tech movies with multi-million dollar budgets probably should not watch this film. But for those, like me, who like to look beyond the major studios because, honestly, there are only so many times you can see the same plot again and again, ""Salvage"" is rewarding. Lewis, as Claire, delivers a solid performance, all the more impressive because it is relatively understated. There are hystrionics, yes, but they come at the right time (as, for example, when her face is about to be removed). Ferry, in the role of Claire's killer, is also solid, also without being over the top. He is also gifted with the best line in the film as he earnestly tells Claire, ""All that matters is what you feel [pause] when I cut your head off.""

1010622,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B000H6SXUG,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[3, 4]","When I popped this puppy in the good old DVD player I had no idea what to expect.  The only thing I knew going in was it was an independent horror movie.  Now based off the majority of independent horror movies I have seen, there was a potential and/or formula for disaster.  However, once I finished my viewing, I was pleasantly surprised.I am not going to rehash the plot too much; many other reviewers have already done so.  Basically, a young woman named Claire played by Lauren Currie Lewis (who looks like a young Alicia Silverstone and young Kim Raver combo) is a convenient store clerk who works the graveyard shift.  Well Claire appears to have a problem; no matter what she does she keeps bumping into ""Duke"" (Chris Ferry).Duke isn't your normal guy; as a matter of fact he is rather morbid. The problem Claire has is she keeps getting ""killed"" by Duke.  Yes I said ""keeps""; once she is killed she ends up starting her day all over again.  Alternately, no matter how Claire's day goes she will bump into Duke and is going to meet her demise.  This film sort of has a ""Groundhog's Day"" feel to it, but with an ominous and austere distortion.The acting is pretty solid; Lewis does a pretty good job as the lead and for the most part is believable (given the circumstances of the plot).  Chris Ferry's performance as the psychopath is a little hit and miss.  There are times he is creepy and then down right daft. The one character who was a little insipid was the guy who played Claire's boyfriend.  He's antics were crude and vexing which I felt did nothing for the plot, if anything it brought the movie down a level.This being an independent movie, it had a ""made on a shoe string budget"" feel to it.  Honestly, I liked it and found it very refreshing.  There were some elements in this movie were a little ""silly"", but I don't think it influence the final product.  Digress, I have seen many independent horror movies and more times than I can count they fall back on tons of nudity, profanity, blood and guts and lack of plot.  Not that I have ANYTHING against the former ""techniques"" of horror movie making, but it is invigorating to see something a little different.Overall I found this to be a nice little gem that was well written and directed.  I also found the score to be hypotonic (the bands were sub par).  The film seems a little disconnected while it is being revealed, but ties up all loose ends before the credits roll.  I would recommend this movie to any horror movie buff.",4,An invigorating & different take on the horror movie,1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,2501,"['When', 'popped', 'puppy', 'good', 'old', 'DVD', 'player', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'only', 'thing', 'knew', 'going', 'was', 'was', 'independent', 'horror', 'movie', 'Now', 'based', 'off', 'majority', 'independent', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'was', 'potential', 'and/or', 'formula', 'disaster', 'However', 'once', 'finished', 'viewing', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.I', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'rehash', 'plot', 'too', 'much', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'so', 'Basically', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Claire', 'played', 'Lauren', 'Currie', 'Lewis', 'who', 'young', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'young', 'Kim', 'Raver', 'combo', 'convenient', 'store', 'clerk', 'who', 'graveyard', 'shift', 'Well', 'Claire', 'have', 'problem', 'matter', 'what', 'keeps', 'bumping', 'Duke', 'Chris', 'Ferry', '.Duke', ""n't"", 'normal', 'guy', 'matter', 'fact', 'rather', 'morbid', 'problem', 'Claire', 'getting', 'killed', 'Duke', 'Yes', 'said', 'keeps', 'killed', 'up', 'starting', 'day', 'over', 'again', 'Alternately', 'matter', 'how', 'Claire', 'day', 'will', 'bump', 'Duke', 'going', 'meet', 'demise', 'film', 'sort', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'feel', 'ominous', 'austere', 'distortion.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'solid', 'Lewis', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'lead', 'most', 'part', 'believable', 'given', 'circumstances', 'plot', 'Chris', 'Ferry', 'performance', 'psychopath', 'little', 'hit', 'miss', 'are', 'times', 'creepy', 'then', 'down', 'right', 'daft', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'little', 'insipid', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Claire', 'boyfriend', 'antics', 'were', 'crude', 'vexing', 'felt', 'did', 'nothing', 'plot', 'anything', 'brought', 'movie', 'down', 'level.This', 'being', 'independent', 'movie', 'had', 'made', 'shoe', 'string', 'budget', 'feel', 'Honestly', 'liked', 'found', 'very', 'refreshing', 'were', 'elements', 'movie', 'were', 'little', 'silly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'influence', 'final', 'product', 'Digress', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'independent', 'horror', 'movies', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'count', 'fall', 'back', 'tons', 'nudity', 'profanity', 'blood', 'guts', 'lack', 'plot', 'Not', 'have', 'ANYTHING', 'former', 'techniques', 'horror', 'movie', 'making', 'invigorating', 'see', 'something', 'little', 'different.Overall', 'found', 'be', 'nice', 'little', 'gem', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'also', 'found', 'score', 'be', 'hypotonic', 'bands', 'were', 'sub', 'par', 'film', 'little', 'disconnected', 'being', 'revealed', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'credits', 'roll', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'buff']",Salvage

Lots of things during the first viewing didn't make any sense but after I understood the ending and how it effected everything that had come before it, the second viewing brought out subtleties that brought everything together.  Every cycle of ""her"" waking up and starting the experience all over again took her deeper and deeper down a spiral into what may be the best depiction of hell that I have ever seen.  If you don't get the ending (and a lot of people don't including a very intelligent friend of mine) then it is just a low budget horror film that makes no sense.  If you do get the ending then make sure to watch it again and it becomes all the more interesting.
