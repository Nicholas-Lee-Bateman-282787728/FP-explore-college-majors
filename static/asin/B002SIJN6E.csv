If you have never seen Martin Shaw in a tv series before, you have been missing a ferocious talent.  He is a UK actor, best known for his UK tv work and stage.  As Americans we have to scrounge to find his work here.If you were to refocus the famous film THE EXORCIST so that the focus was instead entirely on the priest as exorcist and modern ways in which he might confront manifestations of evil and saintliness, this series would be the end result.  Shaw plays such a priest, who is at odds with almost everyone over the ancient rites of exorcism.  He does indeed come into contact with satan and evil and the considerable problem of casting him out.This does not play like some teenage slasher horror film.  It is thoughtful, intelligent and incisive with Shaw embodying all of these traits.  It at times can also be frightening so if you do not like frightening fare, it might not be for you.This is not Shaw's very best work, that is his JUDGE DEED, but it is a solid 4 stars.",4,"Martin Shaw, Catholicism & Exorcism",1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,1100,"['Martin', 'Shaw', 'Catholicism', 'Exorcism', 'How', 'can', 'show', 'miss', 'Holy', 'Trinity', 'tv', 'viewing', 'Answer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Martin', 'Shaw', 'tv', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'missing', 'ferocious', 'talent', 'UK', 'actor', 'best', 'known', 'UK', 'tv', 'work', 'stage', 'Americans', 'have', 'scrounge', 'find', 'work', 'here.If', 'were', 'refocus', 'famous', 'film', 'THE', 'EXORCIST', 'focus', 'was', 'instead', 'entirely', 'priest', 'exorcist', 'modern', 'ways', 'might', 'confront', 'manifestations', 'evil', 'saintliness', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'result', 'Shaw', 'priest', 'who', 'odds', 'almost', 'everyone', 'ancient', 'rites', 'exorcism', 'indeed', 'come', 'contact', 'satan', 'evil', 'considerable', 'problem', 'casting', 'out.This', 'not', 'play', 'teenage', 'slasher', 'horror', 'film', 'thoughtful', 'intelligent', 'incisive', 'Shaw', 'embodying', 'traits', 'times', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'frightening', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'frightening', 'fare', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'you.This', 'not', 'Shaw', 'very', 'best', 'work', 'JUDGE', 'DEED', 'solid', '4', 'stars']",N/A

I believe that under better circumstances this show could stand up to others on prime-time.  It appears to be well written and directed and acted.  I escpecially realized in the latest episode that the show of course, is very controversial when it come to addressing issues within the Catholic church, but also addressing issues about sexuality and a variety of personal religious beliefs or non beliefs.  I think that the directors have tied in all aspects of these issues very well and the outcome has been very, well not just entertaining, but very thought provoking.  I hope that it will be made available in the US soon.",5,Great Show Hope available in US soon,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,685,"['others', 'have', 'caught', 'show', 'Chiller', 'network', 'believe', 'better', 'circumstances', 'show', 'could', 'stand', 'up', 'others', 'prime-time', 'be', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'escpecially', 'realized', 'latest', 'episode', 'show', 'course', 'very', 'controversial', 'when', 'come', 'addressing', 'issues', 'Catholic', 'church', 'also', 'addressing', 'issues', 'sexuality', 'variety', 'personal', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'non', 'beliefs', 'think', 'directors', 'have', 'tied', 'aspects', 'issues', 'very', 'well', 'outcome', 'been', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'just', 'entertaining', 'very', 'thought', 'provoking', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'US', 'soon']",N/A

Gordon,"[1, 1]","Intelligent, mostly well acted, but somewhat frustrating BBC mini-series.This story of a priest pulled into battle with the devil feels like it owes too much to 'The Exorcist' and 'The Omen' (among others) for the first episode or two, but then in increasingly develops it's own quirky, complex personality, with more complicated, morally gray characters and issues than are often found in horror. I found myself ever more caught up.But then, it's let down by an ending less dramatic then what's been promised.We've told this is literally going to be the birth of the anti-Christ, the unleashing of all the demons of hell, etc.Spoiler!So when it turns out to be just a plot on the Pope's life, I felt very confused and disappointed. I felt like there must have been a last episode or two missing.Martin Shaw has a lot of strong moments as our hero Priest, but there are times the performance becomes more than a bit theatrical. Indeed, you could say that for a lot of the acting. Fun, but a bit 'actory'Overall I enjoyed it , I had just hoped for even more on both the visceral and thematic sides.",4,"Some terrific stuff, but a rough start and a disappointing end",1312934400,"08 10, 2011",2011,1097,"['Intelligent', 'mostly', 'well', 'acted', 'somewhat', 'frustrating', 'BBC', 'mini-series.This', 'story', 'priest', 'pulled', 'battle', 'devil', 'feels', 'too', 'much', ""'The"", 'Exorcist', 'Omen', 'others', 'first', 'episode', 'two', 'then', 'increasingly', 'own', 'quirky', 'complex', 'personality', 'more', 'complicated', 'morally', 'gray', 'characters', 'issues', 'are', 'often', 'found', 'horror', 'found', 'ever', 'more', 'caught', 'up.But', 'then', 'let', 'down', 'ending', 'less', 'dramatic', 'then', 'what', 'been', 'promised.We', ""'ve"", 'told', 'literally', 'going', 'be', 'birth', 'anti-Christ', 'unleashing', 'demons', 'hell', 'etc.Spoiler', 'So', 'when', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'plot', 'Pope', 'life', 'felt', 'very', 'confused', 'disappointed', 'felt', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'last', 'episode', 'two', 'missing.Martin', 'Shaw', 'lot', 'strong', 'moments', 'hero', 'Priest', 'are', 'times', 'performance', 'more', 'bit', 'theatrical', 'Indeed', 'could', 'say', 'lot', 'acting', 'Fun', 'bit', ""'actory'Overall"", 'enjoyed', 'had', 'just', 'hoped', 'even', 'more', 'visceral', 'thematic', 'sides']",N/A

It is not in the American format so it cannot be played on American DVD players. I plan to purchase a DVD player that will play movies from the United Kingdom. This came from a third party, and I must say that it came quicker than I had expected!
