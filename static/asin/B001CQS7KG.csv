Schoditsch,"[5, 7]","Ice Road Truckers - The Complete Season 1 (History Channel)was a unique query into the phenomena of ""At The Top of The World"" ice road trucking.  An eclectic group of ice road drivers, the bleeped out language, interaction between drivers and the sheer ""man vs the elements"" made for quite an enjoyable series.Season Two was a bit of a disappointment.  The weeks depicting the gas drill rig being moved and reassembled was good but watching week after week of Hugh ""The Polar Bear"" driving a waste truck, Rick transporting dirty snow and Drew delivering candy & soda just killed the novelty of the whole series.  I'll be taking a pass on Season Two!Ice Road Truckers: The Complete Season Threehas been a delight with the show moving to the USA.

1177375,A3373I4II32NA1,B001CQS7KG,Tyler,"[1, 1]","I was hoping for a second season with the truckers hauling more goods back on the same roads as season 1, but these guys tend to go where they're needed, transporting supplies to the natural gas rigs ACROSS THE ARCTIC OCEAN!!! One of the rigs is a bust and is being relocated and these truckers are the ones who make the move driving over barely 35 inches of ice, which is all that stands between them and their 40-ton loads(sometimes heavier)and more than 120 feet of water. It isn't like Season 1, where there are ""land bridges"" and driving over 60-feet deep lakes. The entire ROUTE is nothing but the frozen waters of the MacKenzie River and the Arctic Ocean itself!I was hoping that Drew would make a comeback much better than Season 1, but he ends up quitting on the first day due to his impatience in waiting for a load to come in, and ends up driving a box truck around town much of the time, but he DOES end up making 9 trips across the ice anyway in a semi-truck doing grocery runs. Some would call this rather pathetic comparing to what the other guys would haul, but people gotta eat too! And he still takes the risk of running through the ice especially when it gets warmer and the ice is melting everywhere.Hugh made the most trips, an astonishing 67, and beating the top scorer there by one more load. Most of these trips were made with some kind of vacumn truck, a VAC truck as they call it, emptying waste tanks and stuff, and one review even criticized Hugh for not having the better loads, but he's getting paid just the same and also taking the same risks, and it's a big improvement to the environment considering that the waste tanks HAVE to be emptied somehow. Hugh will take the dirty jobs, but you can tell his pride won't let him go low enough to be like Drew going around town in a 1-ton box truck.Alex is the one I was concerned about. He did some 20-odd trips across the ice, not complaining a single bit like Rick obviously was doing the entire season, and Alex was the one who wasn't in top shape with his health either. He gets lost across the ice missing a turn and doesn't even complain about that either! He only brought the matter of his declining health to the attention of the others when it was apparent that he couldn't make one more load without it being a serious hazard to his health with his increasing illness. He is evacuated and taken back to Yellowstone, the rest of the season being a washout for him. Hugh even shows great concern for his friend by showing up for him in the hospital to be by his side.Rick was quite the restless one this season. He'd take his truck bouncing across the ice at excessive speeds. ""They told me to drive at whatever I was comfortable with."" he explains with a grin, and you see him bouncing around his cab at those speeds, but he didn't take into consideration the fact that his TRUCK wouldn't be as comfortable taking it to the limit on those roads, and he spends some time off the road while an oil pan replacement has to be flown in for his truck, a considerable delay. He complains about the delays, complains that he's not being treated fairly, and even while grudgingly doing jobs like hauling garbage and dirty snow, he even has a bit of a Good Samaritan in him as he goes out of his way to personally help out a fellow trucker who finds out his heater is no longer working in -40 temperatures. He shadows the guy's truck and stops several times with his truck as dead-weight on the ice so the distressed trucker can go to his cab and warm up instead of freezing to death. THAT is friendship right there! But Rick gets FIRED on the LAST DAY of the season due to his impatience when his incoming cargo for the last run can't seem to get onto his flatbed trailer. Should have learned to use a winch after all, right???I give this season 5 stars. And only because I can't put on six or seven stars.
