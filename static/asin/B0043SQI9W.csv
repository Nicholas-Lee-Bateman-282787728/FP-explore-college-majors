I don't think I ever saw his second Bananas appearance, but I did see his DVDs (Full Range of Motion, and I'm No Rockstar.)  Funny mix of songs and clean Christian comedy.  I saw a few clips here and there for this show Insanitized and I laughed hysterically.  I watched the DVD and I laughed even more!  Again, nice mix of funny songs and some very funny stand-up!By the way, there's a tiny bit of overlap between DVDs, but here it's pretty much new stuff which is awesome for someone like Tim Hawkins.  Keep bringing the funny, but in entirely new ways.  A few bits that stand out (this is referencing the Chapter Menu foldout within the DVD: The Government Can (funny but too true song), 3rd Wheel (start-out song on this DVD), Unwashed masses, Bad candy (yep, we've all had bad candy come Halloween time), and a few more tracks later in the show that talks about his kids.  A hysterically funny bit is when he talks about stuff being in the Bible, and when he talks about the Precious Moments Bible not illustrating specific moments.There's a song he does called I'm a Christian.  It's a serious song, and it kind of threw me off (not because it was a bad song or anything, I just wasn't expecting it), but it was a lovely, nice song.  Then he closes it out with a song called Twinkie.  It's a reference to a bit about churches and sermons.All in all, this was an awesome hour and thirteen minutes of clean Christian comedy.
