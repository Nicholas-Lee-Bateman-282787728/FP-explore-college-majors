The story is engaging, about how it would be to actually have Christmas every day of the year.

Charles Durning is a sweet and gentle Santa and my daughter loves seeing Elmo interact with him and the Easter Bunny (a hilarious Harvey Firestein in a bunny costume, raspy singing voice and all)  Though not your usual story of Christmas, and certainly not much learning will be done during this tape, it's pure fun to watch and the songs are catchy.

188411,A307YFSORUAXSQ,1573305588,NYCPickyMom,"[2, 3]","This feature starts off with Maya Angelou reading a story to some of the monsters on Sesame Street during the holidays. Christmas is so much fun on Sesame Street that they wish Christmas could be every day. Maya then recounts the year that Elmo saved Christmas and almost destroyed everyone's Xmas spirit. Santa gets stuck in Elmo's chimney and when Elmo helps him out Santa gives him a magical snowglobe which will grant him 3 wishes. Elmo wishes for Christmas every day and soon comes to realize that too much of a good thing doesn't end up so good after all. Big Bird almost loses it waiting for his best friend Sunffy to return from Christmas at Grandma's....if Christmas would ever end. Santa's elves are in desperate need of a vacation, Santa's ready to retire and Grover has run out of Xmas trees to sell. Nothing's getting fixed since Maria's fix it shop is closed for the holidays and everyone gets tired of the whole Christmas routine pretty quickly. It definitely makes for some funny scenes and songs when we see Christmas on Easter and the 4th of July. Elmo finally decides Christmas would be better off left the way it was and he takes his sled and his reindeer back to the night he pulled Santa out of the chimney. He picks another toy as a reward and Christmas returns to its cherised one day status. In contrary to what some other reviewers feel, I think this story teaches us to appreciate the holidays and not take them for granted. The holidays are special because they only come once a year. If you're looking for a traditional Xmas tale with traditional Xmas songs then this isn't for you. It's good for a different perspective on the holiday and for some lighthearted fun. My daughter is 14 months old and has loved Elmo for quite a while now. She loves this episode and I've even caught her humming along with the truly infectious songs which I catch myself singing throughout the day.

188415,A1C9GCHR99WX3F,1573305588,Stephen Verhaeren,"[0, 0]","In Elmo Save Christmas, Elmo learns that no matter how much he likes it or doesn't like it, you just can't have Christmas every day. And that if every day was Christmas, there wouln't be Christmas at all, and even a lot of business that are closed for holidays like Christmas, would have work piling up, which evnetilyy leads them to go out of business. So if your kids want Christmas every day, or jsut ask for it every day, instead of explaing it to them, just show this video, and let them discover for themselves just why you can't have Christmas every day.As the special opens, some of the Muppets and Maya Angelou, are openning Christmas when Telly decides that he wants to have Christmas every day, which promptes Maya ask Telly, if Elmo ever told him about the time, he save Christmas, and then almost lost it again, so she tells them the tale. Now on Sesame Street, Elmo has gotten some Christmas cookies from Mr. Handford (David Langston Smyrl) and is going home to leave them out there, but the Cookie Monster wants to eat a few of the cookies, to help ligten the load, but Elmo (voice of Kevin Flash) doesn't let him, and he brings the cookies home, and leaves the cookies by the fire, and settles in to watch It's a Wonderful Life on TV, but does fall asleep in front of the TV that is blacked out and all you can see if flash. But wakes up when Santa (Charles Durning) gets stuck inside his chinmony, and Elmo pulls him out, and saves Christmas for girls and boys all over the world, or at least the ones that celbrate Christmas. And when Santa goes to open his bag, a young reindeer in trainning named Lightning is in his bag, and is in trouble with Santa, and he gets grounded, and is ordered by Santa before to sit in the back of the slay, and to be quiet, but before he leaves Santa gives Elmo an extra speical Chirstmas gift, and his chocies are a bear or a magical snowgolbe that grants wishes, and Elmo takes the snowglobe, and his first wish, which turns out to be for a glass of water. He couldn't just get up, and get himself a glass of water, without wasting a wish.So the next morning comes, and Elmo is getting presents from Gordon, and his family, and from Carlo, and a hug from Rosita, and then the idea for his 2nd wish, and that is Christmas Every day. While the elves are planning their vacation, all of a sudden the toy machine starts up and again, and the elves report to Santa, and Santa tells himn that he gaves wishes to Elmo on Sesame Strreet, and has to go to see him, and all the reindeer are sleeping form having to work hard all night long, remember it is Christmas Day. And his only choice of a reindeer to take is Lighting. So they hatch him up on a slay, so back on Sesame Street the gang is at Hooper's store, watching It's a Wonderful Life, when a breaking news store breaks in, coverage gets taken to Kermit T. Frog, where he reports that it is Christmas again, and then they have to start planning for Christmas every day, so they go out to do more shopping, and then Elmo meets up with Santa, and gives him the speech about having Christmas every day, and signs him a song. And then gives him the chance to go in the future, to see what Christmas would look like next spring, when it is warm, annd the summer when it is hot, and then next winter, when it really is Christmas, so Elmo gets the chance to see if he really likes the idea of Christmas every day, and along the way he sees Big Bird (voice of Caroll Spinney) that is missing his best frerind Snuffy who is in Cincinnati, visiting his granny for Christmas, and he spends them time writing postcards to Snuffy telling him how much he misses him, when he knows that it is still Christmas, and that the mail doesn't get picked up or delievered on Christmas. Harvey Fierstein has a cameo, as the Easter Bunny. The songs are It's Christmas Again, Every Day Can't be Christmas, Give Your Freind an Easter Egg for Christmas, All I want for Christmas is You, and Keep Christmas with you (all through the year).
