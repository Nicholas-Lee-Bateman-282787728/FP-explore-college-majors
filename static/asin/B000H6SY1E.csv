I never missed it growing up and am so thankful that unedited episodes are available on DVD.  If there is a volume 3 (I think there will be since volume 1 suprisingly sold well, and vol. 2 will do likewise), there should be a Friday episode from season 4 so we can see the production credits.  They haven't been seen since their original airing so it will be worth it.  Also, more season 1 Friday shows with the now classic Love of Chair segment over the credits.  Apparently, the boy (Skip Hennat), does different things over the credits (including falling asleep!!).  I will stick by that this show (and Sesame Street) are FAR better than any show you will find for kids.  From Barney to Bob the Builder to Spongebob; these shows are idiotic and I would rather die than show these shows to kids.  Shows produced by CTW are the ONLY shows that I would recommend to kids.  I have learned though that some of the episodes have been slightly altered (particularly some of the Spidey segments) but that shouldn't stray people away from this set.",5,better than anything you'll find on TV today for kids,1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,1088,"['amazing', 'how', 'well', 'show', 'held', 'up', 'never', 'missed', 'growing', 'up', 'am', 'so', 'thankful', 'unedited', 'episodes', 'are', 'available', 'DVD', 'volume', '3', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'volume', '1', 'suprisingly', 'sold', 'well', 'vol', '2', 'will', 'do', 'likewise', 'should', 'be', 'Friday', 'episode', 'season', '4', 'can', 'see', 'production', 'credits', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'original', 'airing', 'will', 'be', 'Also', 'more', 'season', '1', 'Friday', 'shows', 'now', 'classic', 'Love', 'Chair', 'segment', 'credits', 'Apparently', 'boy', 'Skip', 'Hennat', 'different', 'things', 'credits', 'including', 'falling', 'asleep', 'will', 'stick', 'show', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'are', 'FAR', 'better', 'show', 'will', 'find', 'kids', 'Barney', 'Bob', 'Builder', 'Spongebob', 'shows', 'are', 'idiotic', 'would', 'rather', 'die', 'show', 'shows', 'kids', 'Shows', 'produced', 'CTW', 'are', 'ONLY', 'would', 'recommend', 'kids', 'have', 'learned', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'slightly', 'altered', 'particularly', 'Spidey', 'segments', 'should', ""n't"", 'stray', 'people', 'away', 'set']",The Best Of The Electric Company - Volume 2

It is funny, educational, and it really works in a very simple way to help the kids to read.  They find it just as corny as it is, but that's the fun of it.  They laugh out loud and read along.

OMG!Anyways, each of the other actor's - Louis Avlos, Skip Hinnant, Hattie Winston, Judy Graubart and Jim Boyd introduce the episodes as well as the trivia bits in between episodes.What's even nicer is those ""missing"" sketches appear to be on here: ex. ""Sweet Sweet Sway"", ""Phantom of Love"", ""Grease This Town"", ""We are out of Sweet Rolls"", ""Happy Birthday Miss Jones Cartoon"" ""The Six Dollar & Thirty Nine Cent Man"", Julie Grown Up (aka Julie The Cook), ""The Kid's  A Hot Shot"" Song, etc.It's also nice to sample a little more episodes from the 2nd season.Of course there are definately a bunch of repeat sketches/cartoons like ""I would Die For A Piece of Your Pie"", ""Unlock Your Love, Unbutton Your Mind"", ""Right On"", ""Silent E"", ""Grin (w/ Louis Avlos), Skip Hinnant Blind Folded with each cast member handing him an object that starts with ""GR"", ""Sneeze, Snore, Sniff"" song, and many more.Unfortunately there are a few sketches/songs still missing in action such as Tom Lerher's version of ""The L-Y Song"", ""Sock Hop"" song, and ""Billy Lick-A-Lolly"".Still it's a very entertaining set - hopefully we'll see a third volume someday!Bottom Line: We All Get Old!  --- oops no I mean This is another great set!!!
