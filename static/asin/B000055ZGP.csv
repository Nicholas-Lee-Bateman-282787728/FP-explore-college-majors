For each body part, there are 2 workouts - a beginner & intermediate.  Each workout is about 15 minutes including a few minutes of stretching to warm up.  I do quite a bit of exercise & think the intermediate is a challenge, so the workouts definitely appeal to different levels.  The great thing is the workouts contain different exercises rather than your ordinary crunches, etc. so you get a nice variety.I love the fact that each workout is only 15 minutes since most of us working women don't have a lot of time for exercise. These are designed to give you maximum results in a short period of time.

I love that there are six intense 15-minute sections I can pick from for arms, abs and buns/legs depending on how much time I have. I love to add these sections onto other workouts, mainly after cardio. I also love that she does about 3 sets of most exercises which makes that difference between 'toning' and getting the muscles really worked.

Tamilee is upbeat but not annoying like many other fitness instructors.  Her style is low key and she always encourages you to squeeze out that last ""set"".This DVD has 6 different 15-minute workouts associated with it: 2 abs, 2 buns, and 2 arm workouts.  You can pick 1, all 6, or a combination of workouts to do in one sitting. Each target zone has 2 workouts with the second one presumably a bit harder than the first.  I myself have not ""graduated"" from the first workout series but I am already noticing well-defined and toned muscles.As a bonus, this DVD also comes with extras.  There is a fitness Q & A section and a 10-day diet plan (your breakfast, lunch, and dinner for 10 days are listed for you on the DVD). The only equipment you need is a set of 3-10 pound weights (if you want to do the arm workout).The one down side of this DVD is that you can't fast forward through the opening credits. I advise you pop the DVD in, THEN get yourself ready for the workout.  By the time you are dressed and ready with your weights the DVD will have advanced to the main menu.Overall, this is a great DVD for target toning.

567828,A37RIRXE3WECZ,B000055ZGP,April Blake,"[2, 2]","I already owned a couple of Tamilee's Quick Toning videos and worried that the exercises covered on this DVD would be just a shuffling around and re-editing of those, but was happy to discover that she's put a lot of new (or new to me) exercises on here.The DVD is organized so that Program One for each body part is &quot;easier&quot; and Program Two is more difficult.  I've been working out pretty faithfully with this DVD since January, and I am still amply challenged by Program One for all the muscle groups (read: I haven't dared to see what's in store for me in Program Two yet).  I find that while each exercise might not be terribly difficult in itself--crunches, dumbbell presses, or lunges--the way Tamilee orders them is very challenging, especially by the second set for abs and by the second and third for the arms and buns.  I do wish that there was more time spent on stretching at the end, because after the exercises, I feel like I really need it, but the Total Stretch for Beginners is excellent for that--highly recommended.Just a word about the Alternate Angle and Music Only features--I can't see where the different angle really helps me get a better picture of how to do the exercises, and the music on this DVD is nothing special.  What makes this a really cool way to work out is that you can go right to the section you want, without messing around with rewind and fast-forward.  And I think it's nice that instead of barking at you to do more reps, Tamilee says &quot;4 more please.  Don't give up on yourself.&quot;  I think that's a lot more motivating than the drill sergeant approach.",5,A Brilliant Way to Work Out,1015977600,"03 13, 2002",2002,1617,"['already', 'owned', 'couple', 'Tamilee', 'Quick', 'Toning', 'videos', 'worried', 'exercises', 'covered', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'shuffling', 'around', 're-editing', 'was', 'happy', 'discover', 'put', 'lot', 'new', 'new', 'here.The', 'DVD', 'organized', 'so', 'Program', 'One', 'body', 'part', 'quot', 'easier', 'quot', 'Program', 'Two', 'more', 'difficult', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'out', 'pretty', 'faithfully', 'DVD', 'January', 'am', 'still', 'amply', 'challenged', 'Program', 'One', 'muscle', 'groups', 'read', 'have', ""n't"", 'dared', 'see', 'what', 'store', 'Program', 'Two', 'yet', 'find', 'exercise', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'terribly', 'difficult', 'crunches', 'dumbbell', 'presses', 'lunges', 'way', 'Tamilee', 'orders', 'very', 'challenging', 'especially', 'second', 'set', 'abs', 'second', 'third', 'arms', 'buns', 'do', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'time', 'spent', 'stretching', 'end', 'exercises', 'feel', 'really', 'need', 'Total', 'Stretch', 'Beginners', 'excellent', 'highly', 'recommended.Just', 'word', 'Alternate', 'Angle', 'Music', 'Only', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'where', 'different', 'angle', 'really', 'get', 'better', 'picture', 'how', 'do', 'exercises', 'music', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'special', 'What', 'really', 'cool', 'way', 'work', 'out', 'can', 'go', 'right', 'section', 'want', 'messing', 'around', 'rewind', 'fast-forward', 'think', 'nice', 'instead', 'barking', 'do', 'more', 'reps', 'Tamilee', 'quot', '4', 'more', 'please', 'Do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'yourself.', 'quot', 'think', 'lot', 'more', 'motivating', 'drill', 'sergeant', 'approach']",The Science of Fitness with Tamilee: I Want That Body!

567833,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000055ZGP,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[37, 39]","Tamilee Webb, a well-known veteran instructor, has put together a new series of ""I want those..."" tapes. Each tape contains two 15-minute workouts focused on a particular part of the body, with the second workout being more challenging than the first.  At the start of each video, Tamilee explains that she did exhaustive research to determine which exercises were the most effective and then included the exercises that rated highest in her workouts.  For each workout, Tamilee is exercising solo in the same studio from her ""Quick Toning"" series (minus the two televisions showing her from different angles).  In fact, the entire feel of this series is similar to the QT workouts, but it moves much more quickly--eg, shorter warmups and cooldowns, and much less transition time between the exercises.The ""I Want That Body!"" tape focuses on strength training for the entire body.  Tamilee starts each workout with a very brief warm-up: only 2-3 minutes of moving around and stretching.  In the first program, she begins with a sequence of four standing moves:  lunges, squats, biceps, and shoulders.  She then moves to floor, where she does a unique tricpes move--sort of a one-armed side pushup--and two abs exercises. Each exercise is done for 8 repetitions, and then the entire sequence is repeated twice, followed by a brief cool-down.In the second workout, there is a greater focus on the buttocks, iincluding some unique leg extensions, squats, and lunges using a chair.  Tamilee then moves on to arms/shoulders and does a set of flies, concentration curls, and tricep dips (with the chair).  The only abs work is a weighted side bend; there are no abs moves on the floor.  In the first set, there are 12 repetitions of all exercises, and then most (but not all) of the sequence is repeated a second time for 8 reps.  Finally, there is a brief cool-down at the end.Tamilee moves very quickly through both workouts. Although her cuing is excellent, she is sometimes on to the next move before you have a chance to adequately set up for it, so I found myself pausing the tape here and there (especially since many of the moves were unfamiliar to me). Although I like Tamilee and enjoyed both workouts, I question their utility, as the workouts are too short to really adequately address each muscle group.  In particular, the few moves for arms left me feeling that I didn't get a very good workout in this area, and the attention to abs is pretty minimal, especially in the second workout.  On the other hand, however, my butt and thighs were definitely sore the next day, so those areas seemed to get more of a workout than I had originally thought (after doing both workouts on the same day).So, I think that this tape might be useful in the following scenarios: 1) beginners would probably find the tape useful using light weights and doing the two workouts on alternate days; 2) intermediates would probably find it useful to do both workouts together using moderate/heavy weights on days that they are time-crunched; and 3) advanced could probably use this tape as a warm-up to more intense toning by doing one or both workouts.",4,"Two good full-body programs, but some areas neglected.",1029110400,"08 12, 2002",2002,3139,"['Tamilee', 'Webb', 'well-known', 'veteran', 'instructor', 'put', 'together', 'new', 'series', 'want', 'tapes', 'tape', 'two', '15-minute', 'workouts', 'focused', 'particular', 'part', 'body', 'second', 'workout', 'being', 'more', 'challenging', 'first', 'start', 'video', 'Tamilee', 'did', 'exhaustive', 'research', 'determine', 'exercises', 'were', 'most', 'effective', 'then', 'included', 'exercises', 'rated', 'highest', 'workouts', 'workout', 'Tamilee', 'exercising', 'solo', 'same', 'studio', 'Quick', 'Toning', 'series', 'two', 'televisions', 'showing', 'different', 'angles', 'fact', 'entire', 'feel', 'series', 'similar', 'QT', 'workouts', 'much', 'more', 'quickly', 'eg', 'shorter', 'warmups', 'cooldowns', 'much', 'less', 'transition', 'time', 'exercises.The', 'Want', 'Body', 'tape', 'strength', 'training', 'entire', 'body', 'Tamilee', 'workout', 'very', 'brief', 'warm-up', 'only', '2-3', 'minutes', 'moving', 'around', 'stretching', 'first', 'program', 'sequence', 'four', 'standing', 'moves', 'lunges', 'squats', 'biceps', 'shoulders', 'then', 'floor', 'where', 'unique', 'tricpes', 'move', 'sort', 'one-armed', 'side', 'pushup', 'two', 'abs', 'exercises', 'exercise', 'done', '8', 'repetitions', 'then', 'entire', 'sequence', 'repeated', 'twice', 'followed', 'brief', 'cool-down.In', 'second', 'workout', 'greater', 'focus', 'buttocks', 'iincluding', 'unique', 'leg', 'extensions', 'squats', 'using', 'chair', 'Tamilee', 'then', 'arms/shoulders', 'set', 'flies', 'concentration', 'curls', 'tricep', 'dips', 'chair', 'only', 'abs', 'work', 'weighted', 'side', 'bend', 'are', 'abs', 'moves', 'floor', 'first', 'set', 'are', '12', 'repetitions', 'exercises', 'then', 'most', 'not', 'sequence', 'repeated', 'second', 'time', '8', 'reps', 'Finally', 'brief', 'cool-down', 'end.Tamilee', 'very', 'quickly', 'workouts', 'cuing', 'excellent', 'sometimes', 'next', 'move', 'have', 'chance', 'adequately', 'set', 'up', 'so', 'found', 'pausing', 'tape', 'here', 'there', 'especially', 'many', 'moves', 'were', 'unfamiliar', 'like', 'Tamilee', 'enjoyed', 'workouts', 'question', 'utility', 'workouts', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'really', 'adequately', 'address', 'muscle', 'group', 'particular', 'few', 'moves', 'arms', 'left', 'feeling', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'good', 'workout', 'area', 'attention', 'abs', 'pretty', 'minimal', 'especially', 'second', 'workout', 'other', 'hand', 'however', 'butt', 'thighs', 'were', 'definitely', 'next', 'day', 'areas', 'seemed', 'get', 'more', 'workout', 'had', 'originally', 'thought', 'doing', 'workouts', 'same', 'day', '.So', 'think', 'tape', 'might', 'be', 'useful', 'following', 'scenarios', '1', 'beginners', 'would', 'probably', 'find', 'tape', 'useful', 'using', 'light', 'weights', 'doing', 'two', 'workouts', 'alternate', 'days', '2', 'intermediates', 'would', 'probably', 'find', 'useful', 'do', 'workouts', 'together', 'using', 'moderate/heavy', 'weights', 'days', 'are', 'time-crunched', '3', 'advanced', 'could', 'probably', 'use', 'tape', 'warm-up', 'more', 'intense', 'toning', 'doing', 'one', 'workouts']",The Science of Fitness with Tamilee: I Want That Body!

She has a friendly yet professional demeanor, and her instruction and queuing are right on the mark. Tamilee demonstrates the exercises alone in a spacious, neatly decorated set and the workout is set to upbeat instrumental music which is heard more in the background. She herself is in fantastic shape, displaying a petite, curvy yet lean, defined, healthy-looking body.This video contains three 30-minute body part-focused segments - with two 15-minute sub-segments each for the abdominals, arms and buttocks. There is also a stretch for the area of the body worked at the end of each sub-segment.  Beginners can choose to only do part one of each sub-segment, while intermediates or advanced can combine all segments for more of a challenge. All of the exercises are done with high repetitions and either light dumbells or no weight for the lower body, so you'll build muscle definition but won't get bulky.The ""I Want Those Abs"" segment includes forward, reverse and oblique crunches, which also incorporate leg lifts, knee bends, as well as standing abdominal exercises with light dumbells to really hit all of the muscles in the abdominal area.The ""I Want Those Arms"" segment includes a variety of basic exercises using light dumbbells while sitting in a chair. This not only works every part of the arms, but also works the shoulders and even back.The ""I Want Those Buns"" segment includes various forward and plie squats and lunges, which although Tamilee demonstrates without any weights, dumbells can be used for more advanced exercisers who want added intensity. These exercises not only help to reshape the buttocks but work the legs as well. Also included are isometric contractions, single-legged squats and kickbacks performed while holding onto a chair that can also be intensified with ankle weights.As others have noted, I also think it would've been more practical to have a single, separate introduction and total-body warm-up, instead of including the same introduction at the beginning of both the Abs and Arms portions, as well as a separate warm-up for each routine, which one will likely want to skip through if they're doing the entire workout. But this is a niggling complaint when taken into account how wonderfully effective and expertly queued the actual exercises are! So just keep the remote handy in case you'll want to skip through some parts. The bonus features include insightful information with a nice Q&A; section about fitness and diet and nutritional tips.Because all of the exercises are proven to be effective, can be modified for all fitness levels, and are divided into body part-focused segments, I'd recommend this video to absolutely anyone.",5,Effective and thorough body-sculpting workout for all fitness levels.,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,2909,"['Best', 'known', 'star', 'Abs', 'Steel', 'Buns', 'Steel', 'videos', 'Tamilee', 'Webb', 'variety', 'basic', 'easy-to-follow', 'exercises', 'have', 'been', 'scientifically', 'tested', 'yielded', 'most', 'effective', 'friendly', 'professional', 'demeanor', 'instruction', 'queuing', 'are', 'right', 'mark', 'Tamilee', 'exercises', 'alone', 'spacious', 'neatly', 'decorated', 'set', 'workout', 'set', 'upbeat', 'instrumental', 'music', 'heard', 'more', 'background', 'fantastic', 'shape', 'displaying', 'petite', 'curvy', 'yet', 'lean', 'defined', 'healthy-looking', 'body.This', 'video', 'three', '30-minute', 'body', 'part-focused', 'segments', 'two', '15-minute', 'sub-segments', 'abdominals', 'arms', 'buttocks', 'also', 'stretch', 'area', 'body', 'worked', 'end', 'sub-segment', 'Beginners', 'can', 'choose', 'only', 'do', 'part', 'one', 'sub-segment', 'intermediates', 'advanced', 'can', 'combine', 'segments', 'more', 'challenge', 'exercises', 'are', 'done', 'high', 'repetitions', 'light', 'dumbells', 'weight', 'lower', 'body', ""'ll"", 'build', 'muscle', 'definition', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'bulky.The', 'Want', 'Abs', 'segment', 'forward', 'reverse', 'oblique', 'crunches', 'also', 'incorporate', 'leg', 'lifts', 'knee', 'bends', 'as', 'well', 'standing', 'abdominal', 'exercises', 'light', 'dumbells', 'really', 'hit', 'muscles', 'abdominal', 'area.The', 'Want', 'Arms', 'segment', 'variety', 'basic', 'exercises', 'using', 'light', 'dumbbells', 'sitting', 'chair', 'not', 'only', 'part', 'arms', 'also', 'shoulders', 'even', 'back.The', 'Want', 'Buns', 'segment', 'various', 'forward', 'plie', 'squats', 'lunges', 'Tamilee', 'weights', 'dumbells', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'more', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'who', 'want', 'added', 'intensity', 'not', 'only', 'help', 'reshape', 'buttocks', 'work', 'legs', 'as', 'well', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'isometric', 'contractions', 'single-legged', 'squats', 'kickbacks', 'performed', 'holding', 'chair', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'intensified', 'ankle', 'weights.As', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'also', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'practical', 'have', 'single', 'separate', 'introduction', 'total-body', 'warm-up', 'instead', 'including', 'same', 'introduction', 'beginning', 'Abs', 'Arms', 'portions', 'as', 'well', 'separate', 'warm-up', 'routine', 'one', 'will', 'likely', 'want', 'skip', ""'re"", 'doing', 'entire', 'workout', 'niggling', 'complaint', 'when', 'taken', 'account', 'how', 'wonderfully', 'effective', 'expertly', 'queued', 'actual', 'exercises', 'are', 'So', 'just', 'keep', 'remote', 'handy', 'case', ""'ll"", 'want', 'skip', 'parts', 'bonus', 'include', 'insightful', 'information', 'nice', 'Q', 'A', 'section', 'fitness', 'diet', 'nutritional', 'tips.Because', 'exercises', 'are', 'proven', 'be', 'effective', 'can', 'be', 'modified', 'fitness', 'levels', 'are', 'divided', 'body', 'part-focused', 'segments', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'video', 'absolutely', 'anyone']",The Science of Fitness with Tamilee: I Want That Body!

Each 15 minute workout is very effective and the length is perfect so that you can't say you don't have time to do at least one workout.  Program 1 of the Buns section is amazing.  It's really tough.  I hate doing just squats and lunges but boy are they effective.  I have a tendancy to avoid this workout but when I do it, I am sore for several days afterward.  It definitely works!  Both ab programs are awesome as well.  Program 2 focuses more on the obliques and that's another one you'll feel the next day.  My only complaint is with program 1 of the arms segment.  I have a tendancy to avoid this workout, just because I've gotten so bored with it.  Instead of doing 3 sets of the arm workouts, I wish she would have included more workouts with fewer sets because I get tired of doing the same thing over and over again.  For some reason the 3 set thing doesn't bother me with program 2 of the arms and both bun programs but I just get annoyed at program 1 of the arms.  It's probably just me though.

I'd say this workout is no different -- it will work if you stick with it. I'd put this workout in the intermediate/advanced category because some of the workouts (mainly buns section) require a lot of balance at a quick pace. Also, she does give some instruction as to the correct form of the exercises, but not for every exercise, so I would say that someone who already understands the correct forms of the exercises (like squats, lunges, etc) would do the best with this. This DVD also leaves a lot of room for advancement because it has 2 programs for each section.

I have no experience with weight lifting and going to the gym is really intimidating (I run on the treadmill but stay away from the machines...too scary) I have 5 lbs dumb bells but I'm thinking of getting a pair of 4 lbers too. All you need is dumb bells, a yoga mat (or carpet would work) and a chair to hold on to during bun work out.Abs:I'm able to do Abs 1 and 2 so I've done both.

Each workout has two parts, the second part being more difficult than the first.I haven't SEEN results just yet in my arms, but I can feel that the muscles have been worked. I've only done the abs a couple of times (I have trouble with my abs--the only places I ever feel the work are my neck, shoulders, and hips), but the buns portion is unlike any bun work I've ever done! There are plenty of lunges and squats to work your muscles and get your heart rate up, but the one that really kills me is the sumo. I was very sore after I did part one of the bun work--it may take me a while to get to the harder work on part two.In addition to the workouts and science, you have the option of seeing the moves from different angles.

Another reviewer commented that Tamilee talks too much through the video. I would have to agree that she does talk a lot, but many of the comments she offers are truly helpful. It's almost like she reads your mind - everything she says ""make sure you're not..."", I have found myself doing at one time or another.

No getting bored, lots of variety, and you can mix it up however you want.2. Tamilee is renowned and experienced, as well as educated. No one likes watching a dippy blond with size D implants and no high school diploma telling them to squeeze their buns. 'Nuff said.3. It's challenging! I thought I was in pretty decent shape but apparently Tamilee says otherwise! Definitely not a beginner workout but still okay for beginners. You feel it afterwards and that's what you want!4. Workouts are short and can fit into anyone's schedule. I hate when I find a DVD I think I want, then read that it's a 64 minute workout. ICK!CONS:1. Not enough stretching before or after. Granted, the idea is a ""quick"" workout, but anyone will tell you stretching is crucial to avoiding pulled muscles. Tamilee even says so at one point in the workout. But she doesn't incorporate it well.2. The arm workout is too fast. It's like she's trying to cram so much into one workout so she does the exercises very fast. When you're holding weights in your hand it can cause injury if you move just the wrong way too quickly. Again I know the idea of the DVD is ""quick workout"" but I think she should slow down here.3. What is with the angle icon???? I have tried every way humanly possible to get that annoying video camera icon off my screen. I read the ""directions"" in the DVD case but it just won't go away. I also don't like how you can't FF through the opening garbage on the DVD.So I suppose if you can overlook the petty annoyances then you'll be okay.

You will feel the burn and there are some new moves here to keep it interesting and challenging.  Beware, there is some techno music in this one that sounds like an unhappy cat--it took me a few minutes to realize that it was coming from the DVD, and not outside the window.The arms sections are what I do at the gym anyway, just with a ""trainer"" in a structured way so it works for me.  I found that having a variety of weights was helpful as some moves are harder then others.The second buns program was a little difficult for me to follow (I like program 1 better).  I'm sure with repetition I'll get it down. The buns program works the legs in general including the thighs.Overall a fantastic DVD that delivers.

I only turn it on about once a fortnight now, but it still is on regular rotation.Pros:- Has Tamilee in it. She is a great role model and a great instructor. She is very cheerful and does not annoy me even if I have her DVD on every day (rotating between the segments, of course).- Combines strength training and cardio - everything is done at a fairly fast pace (yet see 'Cons' below).- The Buns 1 program rocks! I've yet to see anything as challenging and as rewarding as that little 15 minute segment.Cons:- The pace is quite challenging at times. Beginners will feel compelled to cut corners and compromise form for speed. Tamilee doesn't remind you much of proper form for exercises - the emphasis is on keeping up with her. Resist this and SLOW DOWN if you are resuming exercise after a long break - I didn't and in the early days managed to pull a hamstring muscle during the Buns 1 program and then throw out my back during the Abs 2 program. I learned my lesson after that.- The programs target just a subset of muscles, not the whole body. It doesn't matter as much with the Buns programs, as while doing the squats you'd be strengthening your quads, your hamstrings, and to some extent even your ankles as you do the squats and lunges. But it does matter with the Arms and Abs segments!- The Abs 1 program targets exclusively abs, there are no lower back strengthening exercises. If you use this DVD as the mainstay of your strength training regime, you'll develop an imbalance of these two areas. And then you progress to Abs 2 and all of a sudden you need to use your lower back muscles as well as your abs to get off the floor, and if you haven't strengthened them already, you're going to hurt yourself.- Same with the Arms program: Arms 1 goes for biceps, triceps, and a little bit of the shoulders. No attention whatsoever is given to upper back muscles or even posterior deltoids. I have since discovered pilates and corrected this imbalance, but I wish more thought was given to it when designing this DVD.The cons section is a lot longer than the pros, ahem, I don't know how that came about. It still is a solid 4 stars DVD - it's great if you just want to target specific muscles, not so great if you use it as your only source of strength training guidance in addition to cardio exercise elsewhere.",4,A modern classic - but not without faults,1300752000,"03 22, 2011",2011,2400,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'DVD', 'close', 'four', 'years', 'now', 'perennial', 'favourite', 'only', 'turn', 'once', 'fortnight', 'now', 'still', 'regular', 'rotation.Pros', 'Tamilee', 'great', 'role', 'model', 'great', 'instructor', 'very', 'cheerful', 'not', 'annoy', 'even', 'have', 'DVD', 'day', 'rotating', 'segments', 'course', '.-', 'Combines', 'strength', 'training', 'cardio', 'everything', 'done', 'fairly', 'fast', 'pace', 'yet', 'see', ""'Cons"", '.-', 'Buns', '1', 'program', 'rocks', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'anything', 'challenging', 'as', 'rewarding', 'little', '15', 'minute', 'segment.Cons', 'pace', 'quite', 'challenging', 'times', 'Beginners', 'will', 'feel', 'compelled', 'cut', 'corners', 'compromise', 'form', 'speed', 'Tamilee', ""n't"", 'remind', 'much', 'proper', 'form', 'exercises', 'emphasis', 'keeping', 'up', 'Resist', 'SLOW', 'DOWN', 'are', 'resuming', 'exercise', 'long', 'break', 'did', ""n't"", 'early', 'days', 'managed', 'pull', 'hamstring', 'muscle', 'Buns', '1', 'program', 'then', 'throw', 'out', 'back', 'Abs', '2', 'program', 'learned', 'lesson', 'that.-', 'programs', 'target', 'just', 'subset', 'muscles', 'not', 'whole', 'body', ""n't"", 'matter', 'as', 'much', 'Buns', 'programs', 'doing', 'squats', ""'d"", 'be', 'strengthening', 'quads', 'hamstrings', 'extent', 'even', 'ankles', 'do', 'squats', 'lunges', 'matter', 'Arms', 'Abs', 'segments', 'Abs', '1', 'program', 'targets', 'exclusively', 'abs', 'are', 'lower', 'back', 'strengthening', 'exercises', 'use', 'DVD', 'mainstay', 'strength', 'training', 'regime', ""'ll"", 'develop', 'imbalance', 'two', 'areas', 'then', 'progress', 'Abs', '2', 'sudden', 'need', 'use', 'lower', 'back', 'muscles', 'as', 'well', 'abs', 'get', 'off', 'floor', 'have', ""n't"", 'strengthened', 'already', ""'re"", 'going', 'hurt', 'yourself.-', 'Same', 'Arms', 'program', 'Arms', '1', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'little', 'bit', 'shoulders', 'attention', 'whatsoever', 'given', 'upper', 'back', 'muscles', 'even', 'posterior', 'deltoids', 'have', 'discovered', 'pilates', 'corrected', 'imbalance', 'wish', 'more', 'thought', 'was', 'given', 'when', 'designing', 'DVD.The', 'cons', 'section', 'lot', 'longer', 'pros', 'ahem', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'still', 'solid', '4', 'stars', 'DVD', 'great', 'just', 'want', 'target', 'specific', 'muscles', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'use', 'only', 'source', 'strength', 'training', 'guidance', 'addition', 'cardio', 'exercise', 'elsewhere']",The Science of Fitness with Tamilee: I Want That Body!

I find it really hard on my knees. So on a typical Tamilee Webb day, I'd pick abs 1 or 2, arms 2 and buns 2, that's it. Abs 2 is tough but doable. When I pick abs 2, I take a deep breath before starting it 'coz I know I'd be up for a challenge BUT in the end I'd be glad I picked it over abs 1. The obliques and the lower abs are my problem areas and abs 2 has a lot of moves to tone them. I like Tamilee. She talks a lot but mainly to explain the moves and what they do to which muscle groups. This might be missing exercises on chest, inner and outer thighs but hey, she was specific that this DVD was for abs, arms and buns. We're lucky enough to have a little bit of shoulders and back. Bottomline, this program has helped me slim down a bit....well, I mixed this with others + sensible eating.

(Which is why it only gets 4, instead of 5 stars from me). As it is, a great workout that you can mix and match to make it as tough as you want.  The exercises are solid and Tamilee really knows her stuff.

There are 2 programs each for your abs, legs, and arms. Each program is challenging and effective (especially the 2nd Abs program!!!). Try it out on a day that you don't have to walk the next day! The sumo-squats in the Legs program one are a killer!! The DVD is great, because you can pick and choose what parts you want to work out. I like to do one program from each category. I love Tamilee Webb because her cueing is right on and she is serious, but also fun to watch and listen to.... not annoying (like some other video instructers).

Each body is different, so you might be at level 1 on one bodypart and on level 2 for another.  For example, when I first got this DVD, I could get through both the level 1 and 2 arms workout but wasn't even close to being able to get through the level 1 abs workout.  Now I am able to get through the entire abs level 1 workout and really feel that I have progressed in a relatively short time!  I've also progressed from 2 lb. weights to 5 lbs. weights on the arms workout.  The buns workout is tough on the knees with all the lunges (then again, I am over 50 so this may not be of concern to you if you're 20 or 30) so I don't do it as frequently as the others.When I first bought this DVD, it was clear to everyone in my office that I'd done some new workout because I was walking gingerly!

As for Toning, this is one of the very best videos I've EVER had! All you need is a mat, handweights and (for Level 2) a chair...You can feel each muscle working when done as Tamilee directs and you begin to see definition fast. Tamilee gives clear and concise instruction (as always) and I've worked out to her videos for years.It's best to start with Level 1's and work toward Level 2's gradually. All in all, it's like having 6 workouts on one dvd.I think the hardest moves are the sumo squats and the ""Jane Fonda's"" but By God they work! My bod is already getting ""ripped"" again after working out with this for a couple of weeks now. I do use other videos as well, but this one is one of the VERY best ones for toning and defining my arms, abs and buns the way I want them!The best thing is, if you are on a time crunch, these workouts only average to be about 15 mins apiece!
