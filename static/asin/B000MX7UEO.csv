Amy Seccombe does a reasonable job as Princess Diana, as does the man who played Dodi.  This movie takes us through Diana's last days - at times you can feel her pain and during the landmine scenes you can see her determination to do something about this dreadful problem - Diana cared, that came across. You find yourself wishing you could change the ending - if you cared about Princess Diana I recomend you purchase this video.  I got my copy from Amazon, it arrived quickly and in excellent condition - the picture and sound are of good quality.",4,Diana (A Tribute To A Princess),1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,608,"['movie', 'was', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Amy', 'Seccombe', 'reasonable', 'job', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Dodi', 'movie', 'Diana', 'last', 'days', 'times', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', 'landmine', 'scenes', 'can', 'see', 'determination', 'do', 'something', 'dreadful', 'problem', 'Diana', 'cared', 'came', 'find', 'wishing', 'could', 'change', 'ending', 'cared', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'recomend', 'purchase', 'video', 'got', 'copy', 'Amazon', 'arrived', 'quickly', 'excellent', 'condition', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'good', 'quality']",Diana

For one thing, the actors look similar to the real people whom they portray...of course, no woman, no matter how beautiful could ever look EXACTLY like Diana, its like Jennifer Lopez playing Selena. In some scenes however, Amy does look almost exactly like Diana, either because of the hair style, clothing or combination of both. Diana cried a lot in real life as the movie portrays because she was a suffering woman. Amy does however look more like Diana then the previous British movie made of her in 1992 called ""Diana: Her true story."" Not only that, but the accent and personality are much more accurate. If you really like Diana and everything about her, this movie is not that bad. Obviously, it is NOT a Hollywood film, but the final year of Diana's life are very accurately portrayed; from her divorce, to her public role as the ""People's Princess,"" the harrassement by the media, the banning of landmines, the famous metting with Mother Teresa, and finally the romance which blossomed with millionaire playboy Dodi Al Fayed. There is also of course, the wonderful relationship Diana had with her two boys William and Harry. It is a very powerful film but the end is of course heartbreaking!PS There is talk in Hollywood to make the first ever American movie about Diana, supposedly Pirates of the Carribnean actress Keira Knightly is up for the roll, but so far there is no further update.",5,BEST DIANA MOVIE SO FAR,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,1505,"['people', 'will', 'say', 'scene', 'actors', 'were', 'awful', 'are', 'not', 'BAD', 'one', 'thing', 'actors', 'look', 'similar', 'real', 'people', 'whom', 'portray', 'course', 'woman', 'matter', 'how', 'beautiful', 'could', 'ever', 'look', 'EXACTLY', 'Diana', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'playing', 'Selena', 'scenes', 'however', 'Amy', 'look', 'almost', 'exactly', 'Diana', 'either', 'hair', 'style', 'clothing', 'combination', 'Diana', 'cried', 'lot', 'real', 'life', 'movie', 'portrays', 'was', 'suffering', 'woman', 'Amy', 'however', 'look', 'more', 'Diana', 'then', 'previous', 'British', 'movie', 'made', '1992', 'called', 'Diana', 'true', 'story', 'Not', 'only', 'accent', 'personality', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'accurate', 'really', 'Diana', 'everything', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'Obviously', 'NOT', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'final', 'year', 'Diana', 'life', 'are', 'very', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'divorce', 'public', 'role', 'People', 'Princess', 'harrassement', 'media', 'banning', 'landmines', 'famous', 'metting', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'finally', 'romance', 'blossomed', 'millionaire', 'playboy', 'Dodi', 'Al', 'Fayed', 'also', 'course', 'wonderful', 'relationship', 'Diana', 'had', 'two', 'boys', 'William', 'Harry', 'very', 'powerful', 'film', 'end', 'course', 'heartbreaking', 'PS', 'talk', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'first', 'ever', 'American', 'movie', 'Diana', 'supposedly', 'Pirates', 'Carribnean', 'actress', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'up', 'roll', 'so', 'far', 'further', 'update']",Diana

Note: It was a made for tv movie and embellished some, on the actual events....however, based on all that I've read and watched in the media with regard to Diana's life the final year or so of her life, this is pretty accurate. The actors who portray Dodi and Diana look very much like Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed (both in physical characteristics and subtle mannerisms/facial expressions,stance, etc)If you are a major fan of Princess Diana, and would enjoy a sneak peak of how her life played out that final year from 1996 to 1997,  it's definitely worth a viewing!!Enjoy.",5,Diana: The People's Princess,1268352000,"03 12, 2010",2010,615,"['Fantastic', 'film', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Note', 'was', 'made', 'tv', 'movie', 'embellished', 'actual', 'events', '.however', 'based', ""'ve"", 'read', 'watched', 'media', 'regard', 'Diana', 'life', 'final', 'year', 'so', 'life', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'Dodi', 'Diana', 'look', 'very', 'much', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'Dodi', 'Al', 'Fayed', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'subtle', 'mannerisms/facial', 'expressions', 'stance', 'etc', 'are', 'major', 'fan', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'would', 'enjoy', 'sneak', 'peak', 'how', 'life', 'played', 'out', 'final', 'year', '1996', '1997', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'Enjoy']",Diana

I will never forget where I was when my husband phoned to tell me the news of what happened to Princess Diana that tragic night.  She was such a special person to so many people, especially her sons.  She worked to give her life meaning to so many charities and the less fortunate.  If only more of us could and would do that?  The film is a good portrayal of Diana's last years of happiness.
