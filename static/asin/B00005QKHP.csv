What was the point of this?????2.  The poor casting of the younger brother....a hispanic kid (this would have been credible if they said he was adopted or something or that the mother was hispanic).  Plus, the fact that this kid cannot act.3.  The script needs editing badly.  The movie, even more so.4.  SHould have focused more on the relationship between the two young men instead of shifting back and forth between them and the ""fluff characters and scenes"".5.  The acting by most of the cast.....(with the exception of the four leads) is wooden and stilted.6.  Better direction to the actors would have helped.NOW THE GOOD:1.  A beautiful SOUNDTRACK!!2.  A great final three scenes.....with Seth coming out full force at the dinner table, following the church scene with his brother and the scene with Billy and his brother.  The movie is worth sitting through for these three scenes.3.  Nice cinematography.4.  The acting and chemistry between the two leads is very good.5.  Brilliantly written and acted scene with the character of Seth describing what we went through trying to get de-programmed.  (I am waiting for someone to tackle this subject as the basis for a full length film).In the final analysis, this film merits 2.5 stars.  Again, what was the point of the scene with the three women in the kitchen with the pies?????  Bad, Bad, Bad!!But as others have reviewed here...fast forward through the scenes between the two fathers and the women and see only the scenes with Billy and Seth and you have an o.k. but not great movie until the final three scenes.",3,Worth it for the Last three Scenes in the Film...,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,1690,"['O.k', ""'ll"", 'start', 'bad:1', 'Too', 'much', 'attention', 'focused', 'unnecessary', 'characters', 'who', 'add', 'nothing', 'plot', 'What', 'was', 'point', '2', 'poor', 'casting', 'younger', 'brother', '.a', 'hispanic', 'kid', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'credible', 'said', 'was', 'adopted', 'something', 'mother', 'was', 'hispanic', 'fact', 'kid', 'can', 'not', 'act.3', 'script', 'editing', 'badly', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'so.4', 'SHould', 'have', 'focused', 'more', 'relationship', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'instead', 'shifting', 'back', 'forth', 'fluff', 'characters', 'scenes', '.5', 'acting', 'most', 'cast', '..', 'exception', 'four', 'leads', 'wooden', 'stilted.6', 'Better', 'direction', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'helped.NOW', 'GOOD:1', 'beautiful', 'SOUNDTRACK', '2', 'great', 'final', 'three', 'scenes', '..with', 'Seth', 'coming', 'out', 'full', 'force', 'dinner', 'table', 'following', 'church', 'scene', 'brother', 'scene', 'Billy', 'brother', 'movie', 'worth', 'sitting', 'three', 'scenes.3', 'Nice', 'cinematography.4', 'acting', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'very', 'good.5', 'Brilliantly', 'written', 'acted', 'scene', 'character', 'Seth', 'describing', 'what', 'went', 'trying', 'get', 'de-programmed', 'am', 'waiting', 'someone', 'tackle', 'subject', 'basis', 'full', 'length', 'film', 'final', 'analysis', 'film', '2.5', 'stars', 'Again', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'scene', 'three', 'women', 'kitchen', 'pies', 'Bad', 'Bad', 'Bad', 'others', 'have', 'reviewed', 'here', 'fast', 'forward', 'scenes', 'two', 'fathers', 'women', 'see', 'only', 'scenes', 'Billy', 'Seth', 'have', 'o.k', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'final', 'three', 'scenes']",Then Came Summer

675514,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005QKHP,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Jeff London wrote, directed, and produced this little Indie film, and had he assumed only one of the duties, the result would probably have been a much better movie.  The running time is 115 minutes and could have easily been edited down to about 85 minutes by excluding the corniest 'homey scenes' with Aunt Lillian sharing pie recipes and girl talk that add nothing to the plot and only tire the viewer.David (Jesse Petrick) and his little brother Ricky (Anthony J. Domingues) have traveled with their divorced father Brian (Jeff Davis) from their big city home to Brian's beach hometown to visit Aunt Lillian (Phyllis Rodenberger) for the summer. As this seemingly happy family (though broken by divorce) settles in, and Brian reunites with his old buddy Tommy (Jeremy Douglas) who has taken in his younger brother Seth (Mathieu Smith) as a favor to his family, the reason for the change of home will be revealed later.  As Brian and Tommy re-bond, both having losses in their lives since their boyhood, David and Seth get to know each other and gradually  discover an attraction that goes beyond friendship.  After a tender and quiet kiss at night on the beach, they acknowledge their attraction, only to be betrayed by the threat young Ricky poses as he declares he will inform David's father of his brother's perversion! The boys confront their feelings with the David's father and  Seth's brother and find acceptance and unconditional love from families mature enough to accept them.  Seth reveals his several month's history of  'rehabilitation clinic for gays' experience which led to his moving in with his brother Tommy and the bigotry and tragedy of that event solidly bonds all of the families during the summer referenced in the title.Much has been said about the amateur acting in this film, but for this viewer the acting on the part of the four main characters is not at all weak: the direction is flaccid and begs for focus and tightening of scenes that would have made the edited down version of this film a very moving story.  An additional annoyance is the insipid music score (piano only) that breaks into 'Simple Gifts' at the most inappropriate time.  But the message of acceptance of gay boys coming out is handled well and has enough original thought and subtlety to merit watching.

675515,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B00005QKHP,J. Martin,"[1, 2]","A few days ago I wrote my first-ever positive review of a bad movie, because it was very well-intentioned and had a couple of other redeeming qualities. I'm going to do that again for ...And Then Came Summer.I was only about three minutes into it when I paused it and came running to read the reviews. It was _SO_ bad that I didn't think I could keep watching it, but I wanted to see what other people said before I gave up completely. I'm very glad I did that.A few previous reviewers have given more or less the same advice, and it turns out to be excellent: skip over every scene that doesn't have either Seth or David alone, or the two of them alone together with nobody else in the scene. (Conveniently, they're the two blond boys, so you don't even have to watch the bad parts long enough to find out who they are.) Then watch the last few scenes of the movie.I didn't follow that advice exactly--I watched a good bit more than that just to make sure, but I needn't have. If you follow that advice, you won't have missed anything worth watching, you'll save yourself a whole lot of frustration, minor holes in the story (if any) will be filled in by what happens at the end, and you'll end up feeling like you watched a much better movie than you really watched.I found that it became watchable just about where Chapter 7 on the DVD starts, a little before the one-hour mark. That leaves a total of less than 20 minutes to watch, including the end credits, which indicates that with some smart editing this might have been a fairly good short film instead of a terrible feature.Even the end is not what I'd call good filmmaking. The things that make most of the movie unwatchable--very sloppy writing, directing, editing, and weak acting--don't suddenly get dramatically better. But what happens is that the irrelevant story lines fall away, leaving the focus on Seth and David, where it should have been all along. Seth's brother and David's father (who were childhood best friends), Aunt Lillian (who has no function at all in this movie but takes up huge chunks of screen time), the obnoxious redneck friend, and David's incongruously Hispanic younger brother all drop into the background where they belong, and something magic happens.I'm using the word ""magic"" reluctantly, but I can't think of a better word to use when parts that are mediocre at best come together to make something lovely and touching, which the end of this movie is. I don't understand it. So I'm giving three stars for the magic at the end, but only if the movie is edited on the fly with the remote as described above. If you insist on watching Aunt Lillian, take away two of those stars.",3,Very bad movie improves significantly with judicious use of the remote,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,2672,"['few', 'days', 'ago', 'wrote', 'first-ever', 'positive', 'review', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'well-intentioned', 'had', 'couple', 'other', 'redeeming', 'qualities', ""'m"", 'going', 'do', 'again', 'Then', 'Came', 'Summer.I', 'was', 'only', 'three', 'minutes', 'when', 'paused', 'came', 'running', 'read', 'reviews', 'was', '_SO_', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'keep', 'watching', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'said', 'gave', 'up', 'completely', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'that.A', 'few', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'advice', 'out', 'be', 'excellent', 'skip', 'scene', ""n't"", 'have', 'Seth', 'David', 'alone', 'two', 'alone', 'together', 'nobody', 'else', 'scene', 'Conveniently', ""'re"", 'two', 'blond', 'boys', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'watch', 'bad', 'parts', 'long', 'enough', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'Then', 'watch', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'movie.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'advice', 'exactly', 'watched', 'good', 'bit', 'more', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'follow', 'advice', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'missed', 'anything', 'worth', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'save', 'whole', 'lot', 'frustration', 'minor', 'holes', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'filled', 'what', 'end', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'watched', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'really', 'watched.I', 'found', 'became', 'watchable', 'just', 'where', 'Chapter', '7', 'DVD', 'little', 'one-hour', 'mark', 'total', 'less', '20', 'minutes', 'watch', 'including', 'end', 'credits', 'smart', 'editing', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'good', 'short', 'film', 'instead', 'terrible', 'feature.Even', 'end', 'not', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'things', 'make', 'most', 'movie', 'unwatchable', 'very', 'sloppy', 'writing', 'directing', 'editing', 'weak', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'suddenly', 'get', 'dramatically', 'better', 'what', 'irrelevant', 'story', 'lines', 'fall', 'away', 'leaving', 'focus', 'Seth', 'David', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'along', 'Seth', 'brother', 'David', 'father', 'who', 'were', 'childhood', 'best', 'friends', 'Aunt', 'Lillian', 'who', 'function', 'movie', 'up', 'huge', 'chunks', 'screen', 'time', 'obnoxious', 'redneck', 'friend', 'David', 'incongruously', 'Hispanic', 'younger', 'brother', 'drop', 'background', 'where', 'belong', 'something', 'magic', 'happens.I', ""'m"", 'using', 'word', 'magic', 'reluctantly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'word', 'use', 'when', 'parts', 'are', 'mediocre', 'best', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'something', 'lovely', 'touching', 'end', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', ""'m"", 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'magic', 'end', 'only', 'movie', 'edited', 'fly', 'remote', 'described', 'insist', 'watching', 'Aunt', 'Lillian', 'take', 'away', 'two', 'stars']",Then Came Summer
