Sam (Richard Dreyfuss) is a rich older man falling for the younger Renata (Holly Hunter) while her  family looks on, not sure what to make of Whirlwind Sam.  Is Sam simply a  superficial, living-for-the-moment egotist?  Or is he a rare, and easily  misunderstood, creature of guileless passion as Renata believes?Superb, subtle cinematography and perfect casting.  Hunter and Dreyfuss  are the name stars, but Gena Rowlands is every bit as good.  And one could  say that Danny Aiello's actually makes this 'his' film.Another gem  from Lasse Hallstrom, master of the honest sentimental film.

He acted like a sleaze, and then he acted like a great guy, totally sincere, etc.  Then he acted like a sleaze, flattering people, snowing them with gifts, etc.  I simply think the screenwriter was trying for something he couldn't bring off.Similarly with the movie as a whole.  This is not simply a feel-good family, although obviously the screenwriter was trying to paint such a family.  There needed to be more interaction than the stereotyped hugs and such.  Something was missing.Also, the story went nowhere.  There was no plot, and very little story, and it lasted a long, long time.

294046,AG8U6F6226GBZ,6302068983,Lotte,"[1, 7]","I started watching this film during a commercial of a baseball game.  I got hooked on it in the 7th inning, unusual because we were winning,  and was glad we won, because I couldn't turn off the film.Though my favorite films with R. Dreyfuss are Close Encounters and The Goodbye Girl, I was a bit shocked at how old Dreyfuss looked in this film.  But even though I missed the first part, and it took me a while to get the hang of it, I couldn't turn it off.  Interesting, because I'm not sure if I liked it or not. My father's family are of Lithuanian descent, though because they were Jews, they were not considered real Lithuanians.  No matter how long Jews lived in any country in eastern Europe, they were never accepted as part of the country they lived in. And in some Eastern European countries they were forced to live in ghettos even as late as the late 1800's, which is why so many Jews from that part of Europe came to America or Sweden in the late 1800s's as my family did. In any case, I saw no relationship between my Jewish grandparents and this Lithuanian man. We were far more like the Italians than the Lithuanians.In fact, I couldn't understand this guy and his strange ways. I was sympathetic to the Italian family for not understanding him.  It was a nice romance, I guess, but with one messy problem following another, I could have done without a sad ending too.  So, I'm not sure if I liked the picture or not.  The other thing was that Dreyfuss looked about 40 years older than Hunter, and Hunter's faster than lightening attraction to him seemed very odd. I just couldn't understand that attraction, not only because of the age difference, but because Dreyfuss acted so bizarre. Maybe it's because I missed the first part of the film.  I'm thinking about ordering it just so I can figure that out.  I recognized the sister as the wise cracking Kit De Luca from Pretty Woman. She does that kind of smart ass role much better than the depressing sister in this film. Well, that's horseracing.",2,once around....may be enough,1282435200,"08 22, 2010",2010,2015,"['started', 'watching', 'film', 'commercial', 'baseball', 'game', 'got', 'hooked', '7th', 'inning', 'unusual', 'were', 'winning', 'was', 'glad', 'won', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'film.Though', 'favorite', 'films', 'R.', 'Dreyfuss', 'are', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Goodbye', 'Girl', 'was', 'bit', 'shocked', 'how', 'old', 'Dreyfuss', 'looked', 'film', 'even', 'missed', 'first', 'part', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'hang', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'Interesting', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'liked', 'not', 'father', 'family', 'are', 'Lithuanian', 'descent', 'though', 'were', 'Jews', 'were', 'not', 'considered', 'real', 'Lithuanians', 'matter', 'how', 'long', 'Jews', 'lived', 'country', 'eastern', 'Europe', 'were', 'never', 'accepted', 'part', 'country', 'lived', 'Eastern', 'European', 'countries', 'were', 'forced', 'live', 'ghettos', 'even', 'as', 'late', 'late', '1800', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'Jews', 'part', 'Europe', 'came', 'America', 'Sweden', 'late', '1800s', 'family', 'did', 'case', 'saw', 'relationship', 'Jewish', 'grandparents', 'Lithuanian', 'man', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'Italians', 'Lithuanians.In', 'fact', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'guy', 'strange', 'ways', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'Italian', 'family', 'not', 'understanding', 'was', 'nice', 'romance', 'guess', 'one', 'messy', 'problem', 'following', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'sad', 'ending', 'too', 'So', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'liked', 'picture', 'not', 'other', 'thing', 'was', 'Dreyfuss', 'looked', '40', 'years', 'older', 'Hunter', 'Hunter', 'faster', 'lightening', 'attraction', 'seemed', 'very', 'odd', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'attraction', 'not', 'only', 'age', 'difference', 'Dreyfuss', 'acted', 'so', 'bizarre', 'Maybe', 'missed', 'first', 'part', 'film', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'ordering', 'just', 'can', 'figure', 'recognized', 'sister', 'wise', 'cracking', 'Kit', 'De', 'Luca', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'kind', 'smart', 'ass', 'role', 'much', 'better', 'depressing', 'sister', 'film', 'Well', 'horseracing']",Once Around VHS

294049,A1V6X3STFFESI3,6302068983,neverwithoutespresso,"[14, 15]","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.I loved everything about it: the acting, directing, and screenplay are top-notch.  Richard Dreyfus knocked me out with his brilliant, ought-to-get-an-Academy-Award performance as the Lithuanian suitor.  He is so intensely outgoing, he wants so much to embrace and touch people that it hurts to watch him.  He is vibrant, enthusiastic, life-loving and warm, but one of the pivotal themes of the movie is that he is socially very clumsy.  Typically, in a social situation Dreyfuss gives it his all with zeal and falls flat on his face.There are equally brilliant performances by Danny Aiello as the bride-to-be's father and Holly Hunter as the bride to be.The story is about an Italian-American woman from an upper-middle-class family in Winchester, Massachusetts.  I mention the location because one of the charms of the movie is its attachment to place.  Not only does Holly Hunter carry off the Boston accent perfectly (often attempted, seldom achieved), but the subtle social nuances are embroidered in the story.  If you are not from this area, unfortunately, they will be lost on you.  If you are, it will be a rich experience.  Holly meets Richard Dreyfuss on a trip to Aruba.  Dreyfuss falls madly in love with her, and she starts to fall in love with him.  They see each other back in the States and decide to marry.  A source of tension and drama is that Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss are ""odd ducks.""  The other members of the family have always handled their rara avis daughter with love and understanding (with the possible exception of her younger sister).  But the pair of  them start to rub these traditionalists the wrong way, and to an escalating degree.One of the most affecting moments is when Holly Hunter's family gives a memorial service for Danny Aiello's mother.  It is a large gathering of the family.  Close friends and relatives get up on stage and make heartfelt speeches.When Danny Aiello steps on stage to sing ""Mama,"" the room goes quiet.  When he finishes, everyone is overcome.At that moment, Richard Dreyfuss insists on taking the stage to make his own speech.  Danny Aiello's wife gasps, because she knows that somehow this would absolutely be just the wrong thing, perhaps the straw that breaks the camel's back after a series of so many resoundingly off-key gestures so many times by Dreyfuss.But I found myself rooting for him and his bride when I thought the director and screenwriter didn't want me to.  I thought they meant Mr. and Mrs. Danny Aiello and family  to be the heroes and Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss to be--not the villains, but the losers, the misfits, the inappropriate ones.I won't tell you how the movie turns out, but it had me emoting and emoting and emoting and sometimes thinking and it had me to-ing and fro-ing, sometimes confused, and at one time sobbing deep, aching, profound sobs.I must mention that in Dreyfuss's brilliant characterization of a Lithuanian man, he created a Lithuanian man.  I don't know if it was his idea or the director's, but two devices that were used so brilliantly were music and religion, when Dreyfuss marries Holly Hunter and when their first child is born.The marriage ceremony takes place in a real Lithuanian church with a real Lithuanian priest singing the real Lithuanian mass, which is chanted in a deep basso voice, something like the Orthodox Russian mass.  The scene in the hospital room with Holly and the baby is totally awesome.  There is beatific Holly, holding her newborn child, and in comes Richard Dreyfuss bringing a small chorus of Lithuanian women folk singers in beautiful folk costumes replete with flowers and embroidery.  They sing several of the most beautiful a capella folk tunes.

His blue eyes twinkle with love for this girl, her family and for life.  One of the things I most like about the film is that we are never sure if ""Sam,"" the Dreyfus character, is for real or not.  I kept thinking that he might run out on her or turn out to be a criminal or something.  She goes with her heart, takes a big chance, and.....well you have to watch it to find out.  The characters are all so realistic...I loved seeing their varying and varied reactions to larger-than-life, improbable Sam Sharpe.",5,"Wonderful, funny, surprising, and heart-felt",1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,646,"['Great', 'story', 'terrific', 'cast', 'totally', 'worth', 'watching', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'always', 'good', 'seemed', 'especially', 'sparkling', 'one', 'blue', 'eyes', 'twinkle', 'love', 'girl', 'family', 'life', 'One', 'things', 'most', 'film', 'are', 'never', 'sure', 'Sam', 'Dreyfus', 'character', 'real', 'not', 'kept', 'thinking', 'might', 'run', 'out', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'criminal', 'something', 'heart', 'big', 'chance', '..well', 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'realistic', 'loved', 'seeing', 'varying', 'varied', 'reactions', 'larger-than-life', 'improbable', 'Sam', 'Sharpe']",Once Around VHS

His persona as a self-absorbed success who is unaware that he hurts others, reminds me of so many people I know in real life. Ditto Holly Hunter as a  Plain Jane searching for love. Danny Aiello and Gena Rowlands, once again,  show us that thier talents are used to perfection. Halle Hallstrom seems  incapable of making a bad movie. That this picture failed to find its  audience in first run, can now be corrected thru home video. I am looking  for a DVD release, but in the meantime, my VHS tape holds up after repeated  viewings.
