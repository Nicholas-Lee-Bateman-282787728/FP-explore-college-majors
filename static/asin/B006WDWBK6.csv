Still wholesome, with a slight modern edge- malls, computers, giant cells, ""dis"" (as in: ""Yo, you dissin' me?"").

1521199,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,B006WDWBK6,DarthJustice,"[1, 1]","I didn't see Archie's Weird Mysteries back when it ran originally. I think I first discovered this show maybe around a year or two ago (in 2010 or 2011 for you down the road people in future years) on the CW. I only caught a few episodes of it, but from what I could tell it seemed to be an entertaining enough cartoon. Definitely not one that shoved stupidity at the expense of being actually entertaining down your throat like some shows.Archie's Weird Mysteries follows the traditional cast from Archie's Comics--Archie, Jughead, Betty, Veronica, and Reggie. However, this show takes a more supernatural and sci-fi spin than Archie Comics do. Here we have the gang living in Riverdale and each episode finds the characters dealing with strange things threatening Riverdale. These include a giant potato alien trying to turn people into potatoes, a genie who will destroy Riverdale if three wishes are granted, an Egyptian mummy who doesn't like having pictures of him taken, and more.All the characters are pretty much the same as their comic counterpart. Here though, Archie runs an article in the paper called the titular ""Archie's Weird Mysteries"" and at the end of each episode he writes about what a character or everyone learned through the episode's experience.The animation is pretty well done and is traditionally drawn. By that I mean it's 2D instead of CGI or the like. Which I definitely think this show benefits from that. I think a CGI version of this show just wouldn't have had the same charm.I haven't watched all the episodes yet but currently I'm on the second disc. So far there hasn't been an episode that I've really disliked. On the flip side,  the show doesn't seem to be terribly continuity concerned. There will be episodes where a character or characters will clearly witness something not normal by our standards but in the next episode will conveniently forget it happened.One example is Archie. In the first episode, Archie clearly witnesses a UFO and alien and people apparently remember what happened during the episode after the event was over. In another episode that dealt with different aliens, Archie acts like this was the first time he ever saw aliens. Another character witnesses clear supernatural events and come next episode, anything ""weird"" that the show deals with is nothing more than a silly affair or something.Not a big deal but just something I noticed repeatedly happen.The only special features I've noticed this set comes with is several episodes of two other cartoons. Neither of which I could less about seeing, to be honest. But one is the old Sabrina the Teenage Witch cartoon (not the live action one with Melissa Joan Hart) and some show about a girl vampire.The biggest question I had with this boxset is how they packaged the discs themselves. Looking at the box, it's such a nice case and then you open it up and the four discs just in papery slip cases. Not a big deal either but something I wondered why they didn't just spend a little more on something a little better.All in all, a good show worth the few dollars. I enjoy the show a lot.",5,Archie Comics Meets 1950s B-Movies,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,3108,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Archie', 'Weird', 'Mysteries', 'back', 'when', 'ran', 'originally', 'think', 'first', 'discovered', 'show', 'maybe', 'year', 'two', 'ago', '2010', '2011', 'down', 'road', 'people', 'future', 'years', 'CW', 'only', 'caught', 'few', 'episodes', 'what', 'could', 'tell', 'seemed', 'be', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'cartoon', 'Definitely', 'not', 'one', 'shoved', 'stupidity', 'expense', 'being', 'actually', 'entertaining', 'down', 'throat', 'shows.Archie', 'Weird', 'Mysteries', 'traditional', 'cast', 'Archie', 'Comics', 'Archie', 'Jughead', 'Betty', 'Veronica', 'Reggie', 'However', 'show', 'more', 'supernatural', 'sci-fi', 'spin', 'Archie', 'Comics', 'do', 'Here', 'have', 'gang', 'living', 'Riverdale', 'episode', 'characters', 'dealing', 'strange', 'things', 'threatening', 'Riverdale', 'include', 'giant', 'potato', 'alien', 'trying', 'turn', 'people', 'potatoes', 'genie', 'who', 'will', 'destroy', 'Riverdale', 'three', 'wishes', 'are', 'granted', 'Egyptian', 'mummy', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'having', 'pictures', 'taken', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'comic', 'counterpart', 'Here', 'Archie', 'article', 'paper', 'called', 'titular', 'Archie', 'Weird', 'Mysteries', 'end', 'episode', 'what', 'character', 'everyone', 'learned', 'episode', 'experience.The', 'animation', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'traditionally', 'drawn', 'mean', '2D', 'instead', 'CGI', 'like', 'Which', 'definitely', 'think', 'show', 'benefits', 'think', 'CGI', 'version', 'show', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'same', 'charm.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'episodes', 'yet', 'currently', ""'m"", 'second', 'disc', 'So', 'far', ""n't"", 'been', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'really', 'disliked', 'flip', 'side', 'show', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'terribly', 'continuity', 'concerned', 'will', 'be', 'episodes', 'where', 'character', 'characters', 'will', 'clearly', 'witness', 'something', 'not', 'normal', 'standards', 'next', 'episode', 'will', 'conveniently', 'forget', 'happened.One', 'example', 'Archie', 'first', 'episode', 'Archie', 'clearly', 'UFO', 'alien', 'people', 'apparently', 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'episode', 'event', 'was', 'over', 'episode', 'different', 'aliens', 'Archie', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'aliens', 'character', 'clear', 'supernatural', 'events', 'come', 'next', 'episode', 'anything', 'weird', 'show', 'deals', 'nothing', 'more', 'silly', 'affair', 'something.Not', 'big', 'deal', 'just', 'something', 'noticed', 'repeatedly', 'happen.The', 'only', 'special', 'features', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'set', 'several', 'episodes', 'two', 'other', 'cartoons', 'Neither', 'could', 'less', 'seeing', 'be', 'honest', 'one', 'old', 'Sabrina', 'Teenage', 'Witch', 'cartoon', 'not', 'live', 'action', 'one', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'show', 'girl', 'vampire.The', 'biggest', 'question', 'had', 'boxset', 'how', 'packaged', 'discs', 'Looking', 'box', 'such', 'nice', 'case', 'then', 'open', 'up', 'four', 'discs', 'just', 'papery', 'slip', 'cases', 'Not', 'big', 'deal', 'something', 'wondered', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'spend', 'little', 'more', 'something', 'little', 'better.All', 'good', 'show', 'few', 'dollars', 'enjoy', 'show', 'lot']",Archie's Weird Mysteries - The Complete Series

1521203,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B006WDWBK6,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[6, 6]","I'm reluctant to give this set five stars, as I think some viewers would instantly cavil. But I must say I found watching it extremely enjoyable. That apart, it's an whopping good deal: 40 episodes for under ten bucks. The four one-sided discs are held within the case in black paper sleeves, but this economical approach works and is safe for the discs. This was a DIC series dating from 1999, and the set also includes bonus episodes of Mona the Vampire, Sabrina's Secret Life, and Sabrina: The Animated Series, which was produced by Savage Steve Holland of Eek the Cat fame. However, in these series, Sabrina is a pre-teen, which is odd. A free Archie's Weird Mysteries comic book was given out in 1999 for Free Comic Book Day in which Archie asks Sabrina why she seems to be about twelve years old, instead of sixteen, as when she originated in Archie's Mad House comicsThe Best of Archie's Mad House. So what about the series?Archie's Weird Mysteries is quite different from the Filmation cartoons of the '60sThe Archie Show: The Complete Series,Sabrina the Teenage Witch - The Complete Animated Series, which already veered somewhat from the comic books. But there've been a lot of changes in the comics as well since the '40s. I was curious about the Weird Mysteries series, which almost seems like Archie meets Scooby Do, but it's really rather clever. It's the stuff of which ""B"" movies are made, and they have that sort of story arc. Most episodes are self-contained but two three-parters rev back up on the fourth disc. As for the characters, Veronica is played a bit too arch, and there aren't enough shenanigans from Reggie. Jughead, however, comes into his own. For some reason, Archie's red jalopy has been replaced by a red sports car.The writing seems more like comics than cartoons. The dialogue is endlessly fascinating and witty, with parallels between the normal life of Riverdale's teens and the science-fiction happenings overtaking the town. For some reason, the shows open with a melodramatic summary of the upcoming adventure and are bookended at the end with Archie writing his ""Weird Mysteries"" newspaper column. An odd format, but it works, owing to the skillful writers. Archie and his friends are so personable and individual that they can take on such novel terrain. No wonder after half a century they're still going strong.",4,"Archie Andrews, Ace Reporter",1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,2357,"[""'m"", 'reluctant', 'give', 'set', 'five', 'stars', 'think', 'viewers', 'would', 'instantly', 'cavil', 'must', 'say', 'found', 'watching', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'apart', 'whopping', 'good', 'deal', '40', 'episodes', 'ten', 'bucks', 'four', 'one-sided', 'discs', 'are', 'held', 'case', 'black', 'paper', 'sleeves', 'economical', 'approach', 'works', 'safe', 'discs', 'was', 'DIC', 'series', 'dating', '1999', 'set', 'also', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'Mona', 'Vampire', 'Sabrina', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Sabrina', 'Animated', 'Series', 'was', 'produced', 'Savage', 'Steve', 'Holland', 'Eek', 'Cat', 'fame', 'However', 'series', 'Sabrina', 'pre-teen', 'odd', 'free', 'Archie', 'Weird', 'Mysteries', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'given', 'out', '1999', 'Free', 'Comic', 'Book', 'Day', 'Archie', 'Sabrina', 'why', 'be', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'instead', 'sixteen', 'when', 'originated', 'Archie', 'Mad', 'House', 'comicsThe', 'Best', 'Archie', 'Mad', 'House', 'what', 'series', 'Archie', 'Weird', 'Mysteries', 'quite', 'different', 'Filmation', 'cartoons', ""'60sThe"", 'Archie', 'Show', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Sabrina', 'Teenage', 'Witch', 'Complete', 'Animated', 'Series', 'already', 'veered', 'somewhat', 'comic', 'books', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'changes', 'comics', 'well', ""'40s"", 'was', 'curious', 'Weird', 'Mysteries', 'series', 'almost', 'Archie', 'meets', 'Scooby', 'Do', 'really', 'rather', 'clever', 'stuff', 'B', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'have', 'sort', 'story', 'arc', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', 'self-contained', 'two', 'three-parters', 'rev', 'back', 'fourth', 'disc', 'characters', 'Veronica', 'played', 'bit', 'too', 'arch', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'shenanigans', 'Reggie', 'Jughead', 'however', 'own', 'reason', 'Archie', 'red', 'jalopy', 'been', 'replaced', 'red', 'sports', 'car.The', 'writing', 'more', 'comics', 'cartoons', 'dialogue', 'endlessly', 'fascinating', 'witty', 'parallels', 'normal', 'life', 'Riverdale', 'teens', 'science-fiction', 'happenings', 'overtaking', 'town', 'reason', 'shows', 'open', 'melodramatic', 'summary', 'upcoming', 'adventure', 'are', 'bookended', 'end', 'Archie', 'writing', 'Weird', 'Mysteries', 'newspaper', 'column', 'odd', 'format', 'owing', 'skillful', 'writers', 'Archie', 'friends', 'are', 'so', 'personable', 'individual', 'can', 'take', 'such', 'novel', 'terrain', 'wonder', 'century', ""'re"", 'still', 'going', 'strong']",Archie's Weird Mysteries - The Complete Series

1521232,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B006WDWBK6,trebe,"[0, 0]","Led by red headed Archie Andrews, The Archies are a group of high school aged kids who live in Riverdale.  Originally comic book characters created over seventy years ago, The Archies eventually made the leap to cartoons in 1968 withThe Archie Show, where the characters became involved in bubblegum music, producing the chart topping hit ""Sugar, Sugar"", among others.Besides Archie Andrews, the primary characters are Reggie Mantle, Veronica Lodge, Betty Cooper, and Jughead Jones.  Although The Archies were quite popular on television into the 70's, Archie's Weird Mysteries (1999) was the first cartoon to feature the characters in some time.  Centered around the lives of the mostly unsupervised teens, who attend Riverside High, the series does live up to the characterization of ""weird"", as the stories feature unusual phenomena, strange creatures, ghosts, and monsters.  Also featured is Dilton Doiley, who spends most of his time working on projects in the school's science lab.  The author of a column on weird mysteries, Archie is constantly on the lookout for anything strange or mysterious.Rather than playing music, the new series features a different approach to try and reach a completely new audience, who may have never have read an Archie comic, or heard the song ""Sugar, Sugar"".  These adventures may not have that much in common with any of the previous cartoon series, but overall, it's not too radical a makeover, as the characters lives remain centered mostly around school and home, and parents or other authority figures, are at a minimum.  Times have changed, technology has advanced, and science usually plays some role, but the clean cut nature of The Archies, remains mostly true to form.Archie, Jughead, and Reggie, are drawn bulked up a bit, but the dynamic between the characters is much the same.  Betty and the ultra rich and slightly spoiled Veronica, are close friends, but also rivals for Archie's affections.  Veronica who dating Archie, is involved more heavily in many of the adventures, and often refers to him by her traditional pet name, ""Archiekins"".  Reggie is still a bit stuck up, but is less conceited and malicious than he has been in the past.  Jughead still consumes tons of hamburgers, but unfortunately there's not much time for Juggie's pooch, Hot Dog.Fans of the cartoons from the 60's and 70's may get some enjoyment from this series, as Archie's Weird Mysteries is mostly silly escapist fun intended for younger teens, and the animation does a pretty good job of adhering to the basic visual style from the comics.This rather inexpensive collection contains all 40 episodes produced, with a normal sized DVD case, containing four discs housed in paper sleeves.  There are no subtitles, and the set also includes bonus episodes of the cartoons Sabrina The Animated Series, Sabrina's Secret Life, and Mona the Vampire.",4,the archies featured in some strange and really far out adventures...,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,2874,"['Led', 'red', 'headed', 'Archie', 'Andrews', 'Archies', 'are', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'aged', 'kids', 'who', 'live', 'Riverdale', 'Originally', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'created', 'seventy', 'years', 'ago', 'Archies', 'eventually', 'made', 'leap', 'cartoons', '1968', 'withThe', 'Archie', 'Show', 'where', 'characters', 'became', 'involved', 'bubblegum', 'music', 'producing', 'chart', 'topping', 'hit', 'Sugar', 'Sugar', 'others.Besides', 'Archie', 'Andrews', 'primary', 'characters', 'are', 'Reggie', 'Mantle', 'Veronica', 'Lodge', 'Betty', 'Cooper', 'Jughead', 'Jones', 'Archies', 'were', 'quite', 'popular', 'television', '70', 'Archie', 'Weird', 'Mysteries', '1999', 'was', 'first', 'cartoon', 'feature', 'characters', 'time', 'Centered', 'lives', 'mostly', 'unsupervised', 'teens', 'who', 'attend', 'Riverside', 'High', 'series', 'live', 'characterization', 'weird', 'stories', 'feature', 'unusual', 'phenomena', 'strange', 'creatures', 'ghosts', 'monsters', 'Also', 'featured', 'Dilton', 'Doiley', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'working', 'projects', 'school', 'science', 'lab', 'author', 'column', 'weird', 'mysteries', 'Archie', 'constantly', 'lookout', 'anything', 'strange', 'mysterious.Rather', 'playing', 'music', 'new', 'series', 'different', 'approach', 'try', 'reach', 'completely', 'new', 'audience', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'have', 'read', 'Archie', 'comic', 'heard', 'song', 'Sugar', 'Sugar', 'adventures', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'common', 'previous', 'cartoon', 'series', 'overall', 'not', 'too', 'radical', 'makeover', 'characters', 'remain', 'centered', 'mostly', 'school', 'home', 'parents', 'other', 'authority', 'figures', 'are', 'minimum', 'Times', 'have', 'changed', 'technology', 'advanced', 'science', 'usually', 'role', 'clean', 'cut', 'nature', 'Archies', 'mostly', 'true', 'form.Archie', 'Jughead', 'Reggie', 'are', 'drawn', 'bulked', 'up', 'bit', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'much', 'same', 'Betty', 'ultra', 'rich', 'slightly', 'spoiled', 'Veronica', 'are', 'close', 'friends', 'also', 'rivals', 'Archie', 'affections', 'Veronica', 'who', 'dating', 'Archie', 'involved', 'more', 'heavily', 'many', 'adventures', 'often', 'refers', 'traditional', 'pet', 'name', 'Archiekins', 'Reggie', 'still', 'bit', 'stuck', 'up', 'less', 'conceited', 'malicious', 'been', 'past', 'Jughead', 'still', 'tons', 'hamburgers', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'Juggie', 'pooch', 'Hot', 'Dog.Fans', 'cartoons', '60', '70', 'may', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'series', 'Archie', 'Weird', 'Mysteries', 'mostly', 'silly', 'escapist', 'fun', 'intended', 'younger', 'teens', 'animation', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'adhering', 'basic', 'visual', 'style', 'comics.This', 'rather', 'inexpensive', 'collection', '40', 'episodes', 'produced', 'normal', 'sized', 'DVD', 'case', 'containing', 'four', 'discs', 'housed', 'paper', 'sleeves', 'are', 'subtitles', 'set', 'also', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'cartoons', 'Sabrina', 'Animated', 'Series', 'Sabrina', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Mona', 'Vampire']",Archie's Weird Mysteries - The Complete Series
