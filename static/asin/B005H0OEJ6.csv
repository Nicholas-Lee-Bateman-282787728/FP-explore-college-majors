While I still think Memories of Nobody was the best of the movies, this one offers a few reasons to watch and enjoy. As with the other movies, Fade to Black brings in your favorite characters, an interesting enough plot, and a step-up from the series in terms of art and fluidity of the animation. Fans of the series will find this to be a welcome addition to the Bleach universe, particularly as Rukia plays a central role in the film. Aside from her added screen time (which I loved, as she was one of the reasons I started watching the series to begin with) there are bits and pieces of her background that are filled in throughout the story. All this and her ""transformation"" make this a film well crafted for its faithful audience.That being said, I do have a few gripes that don't necessarily take away too much (and are rather characteristic of the series in general) but that bug me nonetheless. First, as in Diamond Dust Rebellion (and to a lesser extent in Memories of Nobody), there is a bit too much overly-emotional sermonizing. While the core canon of the Bleach series (those episodes based off the manga) contain little of this, the side stories and movies seem to add it for filler. Again, this is nothing new, but it steals a little from the drama. Second, this film sets up interesting questions about the limits of ""humanness"" (or, personhood might be a better term) on par with those that Kube brings out through Memories of Nobody and through the Arrancar and their seeming humanity, but just as in that narrative arc there is little down to delve into the question. It is presented (imaginatively so) to the viewer, but is left to hang their unexplored and unresolved. Again, this doesn't hurt the quality too much, but once I would like to see Tite Kubo raise the dramatic tension a bit more.Oh, and the fights are awesome. But you knew that already.",4,Fan pleaser. decent beyond that.,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,1982,"['Fade', 'Black', 'third', 'Bleach', 'full', 'length', 'movies', 'improvement', 'Diamond', 'Dust', 'Rebellion', 'still', 'think', 'Memories', 'Nobody', 'was', 'best', 'movies', 'one', 'few', 'reasons', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'other', 'movies', 'Fade', 'Black', 'brings', 'favorite', 'characters', 'interesting', 'enough', 'plot', 'step-up', 'series', 'terms', 'art', 'fluidity', 'animation', 'Fans', 'series', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'welcome', 'addition', 'Bleach', 'universe', 'particularly', 'Rukia', 'central', 'role', 'film', 'Aside', 'added', 'screen', 'time', 'loved', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'started', 'watching', 'series', 'begin', 'are', 'bits', 'pieces', 'background', 'are', 'filled', 'story', 'transformation', 'make', 'film', 'well', 'crafted', 'faithful', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'gripes', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'take', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'rather', 'characteristic', 'series', 'general', 'bug', 'nonetheless', 'First', 'Diamond', 'Dust', 'Rebellion', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Memories', 'Nobody', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'overly-emotional', 'sermonizing', 'core', 'canon', 'Bleach', 'series', 'episodes', 'based', 'off', 'manga', 'contain', 'little', 'side', 'stories', 'movies', 'seem', 'add', 'filler', 'Again', 'nothing', 'new', 'little', 'drama', 'Second', 'film', 'up', 'interesting', 'questions', 'limits', 'humanness', 'personhood', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'term', 'par', 'Kube', 'out', 'Memories', 'Nobody', 'Arrancar', 'seeming', 'humanity', 'just', 'narrative', 'arc', 'little', 'down', 'delve', 'question', 'presented', 'imaginatively', 'so', 'viewer', 'left', 'hang', 'unexplored', 'unresolved', 'Again', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'quality', 'too', 'much', 'once', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Tite', 'Kubo', 'raise', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'bit', 'more.Oh', 'fights', 'are', 'awesome', 'knew', 'already']",Bleach Movie: Fade to Black
