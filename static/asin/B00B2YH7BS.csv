I actually will admit to watching it twice because I'm having a Lazy Sunday!This is just an awesome documentary looking at one of the most legendary recording studios in music. If you are a fan of rock music that was made in the 70's, 80's, 90's...you'll enjoy this quite a bit. It's worth the $5 or $6, and I will likely buy it on DVD or download it at some point as well.The documentary looks at the beginning of the studio, the first bands to record there and big albums. Interviews with tons of well known music artists and producers are mixed with Sound City employees sharing their memories of working at the studio.It also shows the change, either good or bad, between old-school tape recording and the shift in the music industry to using digital production and computer programs like Pro Tools to produce records quicker and cheaper. The documentary, not surprisingly, tries to make the point that the old way was better, but really, that's subjective.The final part shows Dave Grohl purchasing the Neve mixing console (what made artists come to Sound City) when Sound City went out of business in 2011. It follows the move and hook-up of the equipment in his own studio and the creation of new music on the same recording console by a number of artists who recorded at Sound City in the past.This is the first film that I've felt moved to purchase and view right away in years (I'm not really into movies much) and I highly recommend it to music fans of the period of time between the 1970's and 1990's.",5,A very enjoyable look at a part of music history,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,1580,"['just', 'got', 'done', 'watching', 'demand', 'Cable', 'provider', 'actually', 'will', 'admit', 'watching', 'twice', ""'m"", 'having', 'Lazy', 'Sunday', 'just', 'awesome', 'documentary', 'looking', 'one', 'most', 'legendary', 'recording', 'studios', 'music', 'are', 'fan', 'rock', 'music', 'was', 'made', '70', '80', '90', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'quite', 'bit', '5', '6', 'will', 'likely', 'buy', 'DVD', 'download', 'point', 'well.The', 'documentary', 'looks', 'beginning', 'studio', 'first', 'record', 'there', 'big', 'albums', 'Interviews', 'tons', 'well', 'known', 'music', 'artists', 'producers', 'are', 'mixed', 'Sound', 'City', 'employees', 'sharing', 'memories', 'working', 'studio.It', 'also', 'change', 'either', 'good', 'bad', 'old-school', 'tape', 'recording', 'shift', 'music', 'industry', 'using', 'digital', 'production', 'computer', 'programs', 'Pro', 'Tools', 'produce', 'records', 'quicker', 'cheaper', 'documentary', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'tries', 'make', 'point', 'old', 'way', 'was', 'better', 'really', 'subjective.The', 'final', 'part', 'shows', 'Dave', 'Grohl', 'purchasing', 'Neve', 'mixing', 'console', 'what', 'made', 'artists', 'come', 'Sound', 'City', 'when', 'Sound', 'City', 'went', 'business', '2011', 'move', 'hook-up', 'equipment', 'own', 'studio', 'creation', 'new', 'music', 'same', 'recording', 'console', 'number', 'artists', 'who', 'recorded', 'Sound', 'City', 'past.This', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'moved', 'purchase', 'view', 'right', 'away', 'years', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'movies', 'much', 'highly', 'recommend', 'music', 'fans', 'period', 'time', '1970', '1990']",Sound City

1621388,A1LACLRU1P4GTE,B00B2YH7BS,Bill,"[0, 0]","Recording studios that are famous among non-musicians or anyone who isn't a serious music aficionado can be counted on one hand. There's Abbey Road in London, Sun Studio in Memphis, possibly Capitol Studios in Hollywood or The Hit Factory or Electric Lady in New York. Dave Grohl's eulogy for Sound City will undoubtedly make it as famous as some of the others, albeit a bit too late to save it. The first half of Sound city tells the story of the studio and how it became the choice of artists as diverse as Barry Mannilow, Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, Rage Against the Machine, REO Speedwagon and of course, Nirvana.  Along the way, we learn how the studio became instrumental in the merger of Fleetwood Mac and Buckingham Nicks, and how an almost accidental combination of the room and a custom made Neve console gave Sound City a unique drum sound. There is also unseen home video of the recording of Tom Petty's Damn the Torpedoes and Nirvana's Nevermind.As much as being a history of the studio, Sound City is also a celebration of the old ways of recording music.  While there may be a certain irony in ageing punks like Grohl, Josh Homme and Corey Taylor saying the young kids of today don't get it, they do have a point. Prior to computerised recording, the studio and its equipment were an integral part of a recording's sound. The once unique characteristics of legendary studios and gear have all been digitally modelled now and are available on the device you're looking at right now. It hasn't made recordings better though. As digital defender Trent Reznor points out in the film, there are people who have never used the real versions of the equipment they have digitally emulated on their computers and therefore, don't really know what they're for or how to use them.The second half of the film shows the relocation of the classic console to Grohl's studio and the making of theSound City: Real To Reelalbum with a range of old friends and Sound City alumni. Of all the participants, Paul McCartney comes across as a bit of a ring-in since he never recorded at Sound City like all the others.  However, as Grohl says, he's recording on the console that gave him the life he has with one of the people who made him want to make music in the first place. You can't ask for much more than that.In every way, Sound City is a beautiful, fond and humourous documentary which should educate and entertain both musical obsessives and more casual fans alike.There are three bonus programs, each focussing on the recording of a song for the album. They are all presented in multi-angle, fly-on-the-wall style and provide a fascinating insight into the recording process.Feature:  * * * * *Extras:  * * * * *Audio:  LPCM Stereo, Dolby 5.",5,A loving eulogy and defence of the Old Ways,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",2013,2753,"['Recording', 'studios', 'are', 'famous', 'non-musicians', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'serious', 'music', 'aficionado', 'can', 'be', 'counted', 'one', 'hand', 'Abbey', 'Road', 'London', 'Sun', 'Studio', 'Memphis', 'possibly', 'Capitol', 'Studios', 'Hollywood', 'Hit', 'Factory', 'Electric', 'Lady', 'New', 'York', 'Dave', 'Grohl', 'eulogy', 'Sound', 'City', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'make', 'as', 'famous', 'others', 'bit', 'too', 'late', 'save', 'first', 'half', 'Sound', 'city', 'story', 'studio', 'how', 'became', 'choice', 'artists', 'as', 'diverse', 'Barry', 'Mannilow', 'Neil', 'Young', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Rage', 'Against', 'Machine', 'REO', 'Speedwagon', 'course', 'Nirvana', 'way', 'learn', 'how', 'studio', 'became', 'instrumental', 'merger', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'Buckingham', 'Nicks', 'how', 'almost', 'accidental', 'combination', 'room', 'custom', 'made', 'Neve', 'console', 'gave', 'Sound', 'City', 'unique', 'drum', 'sound', 'also', 'unseen', 'home', 'video', 'recording', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Damn', 'Torpedoes', 'Nirvana', 'Nevermind.As', 'much', 'being', 'history', 'studio', 'Sound', 'City', 'also', 'celebration', 'old', 'ways', 'recording', 'music', 'may', 'be', 'certain', 'irony', 'ageing', 'punks', 'Grohl', 'Josh', 'Homme', 'Corey', 'Taylor', 'saying', 'young', 'kids', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'have', 'point', 'Prior', 'computerised', 'recording', 'studio', 'equipment', 'were', 'integral', 'part', 'recording', 'sound', 'once', 'unique', 'characteristics', 'legendary', 'studios', 'gear', 'have', 'been', 'digitally', 'modelled', 'now', 'are', 'available', 'device', ""'re"", 'looking', 'right', 'now', ""n't"", 'made', 'recordings', 'better', 'though', 'digital', 'defender', 'Trent', 'Reznor', 'out', 'film', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'used', 'real', 'versions', 'equipment', 'have', 'digitally', 'emulated', 'computers', 'therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'how', 'use', 'them.The', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'relocation', 'classic', 'console', 'Grohl', 'studio', 'making', 'theSound', 'City', 'Real', 'Reelalbum', 'range', 'old', 'friends', 'Sound', 'City', 'alumni', 'participants', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'across', 'bit', 'ring-in', 'never', 'recorded', 'Sound', 'City', 'others', 'However', 'Grohl', 'recording', 'console', 'gave', 'life', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'want', 'make', 'music', 'first', 'place', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'more', 'that.In', 'way', 'Sound', 'City', 'beautiful', 'fond', 'humourous', 'documentary', 'should', 'educate', 'entertain', 'musical', 'obsessives', 'more', 'casual', 'fans', 'are', 'three', 'programs', 'focussing', 'recording', 'song', 'album', 'are', 'presented', 'multi-angle', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'style', 'provide', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'recording', 'process.Feature', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*Extras', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*Audio', 'LPCM', 'Stereo', 'Dolby', '5']",Sound City

1621418,A2JYYTQ64J5Y44,B00B2YH7BS,Drive-In Kid,"[46, 92]","The film works as a historical piece but the premises of some of the participants are based on flawed assumptions. Here are a few:1) Digital recording makes it too easy to ""fix"" or manipulate things and this causes the finished product to lack ""humanity"".First of all, since the dawn of multi-track recording decades ago, it has always been possible to fix things with studio trickery. Overdubbing, punching in multiple times, ""comping"" multiple takes together into one, re-recording individual parts dozens of times until they are ""right"" or having session players come and just play the instruments outright. All of these techniques have been used extensively over the years.The choice to do these things or not rests with the artist. If someone wants to do things organically with a band in a room laying down the tracks live that can be done with digital as well. Digital makes it easier to fix things, but I would argue that allows the artist to focus more on the songs and less on the complexities of the recording process. You have to be quite the rocket scientist to mix on a Neve console, not so with digital recording.2) Analog recording (and the Neve console in particular) sounds better than digital.This isn't true anymore and what sounds ""good"" is highly subjective. The Neve might sound different but it isn't necessarily better. Someone with a good pair of ears can make things sound good as long as the gear being used is at least decent. Someone with crummy ears and technical expertise won't get a good sound using a Neve either.The premise put forth in this film is that everything that came out of Sound City sounded great. That isn't true either. Some of those old albums stand up well sonically and some don't. Obviously most of the recordings were ""good enough"" to get on the radio at the time.3) The fact that ""anyone"" can lay down professional sounding recordings is a bad thing.Not everyone in this doc says this outright but some do and others imply it. Digital recording has been a GREAT thing for artists, but the music BUSINESS was upset by it. In the days when places like Sound City dominated, you had to be signed to a big label to record there because of the expense. Only a chosen few had deals like that.They got big advances to record, the program directors at radio stations got paid off to put their songs in heavy rotation and the label made sure MTV played the videos. This was a great system for people like Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, et al. It made them rich and famous. Who it wasn't great for is struggling artists who didn't have a major record deal. They couldn't afford to get a decent sounding recording or have anyone play it.Nowadays digital recording has empowered average people with musical ability to do quality recordings. They can immediately promote those songs on the Internet or with outlets like iTunes inexpensively. Does this mean alot of stuff gets put out that isn't up to snuff? Yes. However, there are thousands of smaller time acts that DO put out amazing music that would never have been heard under the old system.I would argue the indie bands of today are putting out music far more interesting than the crap the ""professional"" artists in this documentary were playing toward the end of the film. There were some great albums that came out when the big labels ruled. However, there was alot of crap too and other worthy artists couldn't even get an audience.In the final analysis the songs are the main thing. Using a Neve console and a 2 inch 24 track Studer deck might be cool but it won't make the music better. A good song is good even if it is recorded with 1 mic and a cassette deck. Recording a great song with digital gear won't make it bad either. What Dave Grohl has done is set up an analog recording museum. It is nice that he preserved a piece of music history. He has the money to spend on a vanity project like that.Meanwhile there are thousands of musicians who dream just as big recording songs into their laptops with hopes of producing great music.

Kentros ""SharkByte""","[0, 0]","There is far more to this film than just the story of the rundown building where some of the greatest albums of all time have been recorded.  It's an insider's look at the recording process and its evolution, featuring insightful commentary from an impressive list of artists who have made some of their best music there and the people behind the scenes.  Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) made this film to tell the story of the studio where one of the most important albums of his career, ""Nevermind"", was recorded.  In doing so, he gave viewers a backstage pass to see the inner workings of a recording studio and what made Sound City the premier recording location for decades (thanks to the Neve recording console), and the switch to the digital era and its impact on music.The first 70 minutes cover the history of Sound City, followed by footage from the recording sessions of the ""Sound City: Real to Reel"" album, which features many of the artists that had recorded there.  The album was recorded at Dave's Studio 606 on that Neve console that came from Sound City, which started the whole idea for the film when Dave purchased it.

Even as a musician, composer, producer, and engineer of my own music, I never really followed the music industry &#34;who's who&#34; and all that stuff. Personally, only bands that I really love get my attention, and even some of them I couldn't tell you the names of the members. I'm a real rarity when it comes to music: I listen to music for the music. Not the photos, videos, press, People Magazine and Rolling Stones coverage and I do not care what other people or the industry tries to tell me is good. I know good because I'm listening to the talent, the arrangement, the composition, the lyrics... all of the things missing from 99% of todays &#34;AutoTune&#34;-ed world.So getting back to this movie, I was spellbound. I had no idea that a large percentage of the great music that came before and made an indelible mark on the music industry was recorded in this shabby little 24-track 2-Inch tape analog studio in LA.But what really impressed me was the fact that Dave Grohl saw what I saw, and knows what I know, and sees a need, a market, and a longing for real music to come out of the mainstream music industry again. I think we are on the cusp of something big, another wave of amazing stadium filling bands and talent, and the wholesale rejection of manufactured, fast-food music created by less than talented individuals that can't program much more than a 4/4 time with only downbeats on the kick drum.I don't want to give it away, but I will say this: after watching this movie, I've been thinking very hard about that 24-track 2-Inch tape studio I had a chance to purchase about a year ago and passed on it because &#34;everything can be done on a computer&#34;. Nothing can replace a good board, hardware in racks, and the warmth and musicality of tape. I just might be joining Dave and opening a Florida Gulf Coast analog recording studio after watching this movie. Of course, there will be computers, but they'll be used as tools, not as crutches.Check out my music at jerryboutotmusic.com - you will love it if you're tired of twerking and dumbloops.

This tell's the story of the rise to fame and demise of Sound City Studios. One of the most freak, yet sought out studios in California all because of it's recording rooms and it's legendary Neve recording desk. I don't want to give spoilers to this fine documentary but...SPOILER ALERT: The master, Dave Grohl had been building his own studio and he wanted that Neve board and made an offer to one of the original owners of sound city as the rest of that studio was being torn down. He had it carefully installed into his new 606 Studios in California. It has newly become the place were real musicians now do at least one song at for their new albums. It is 100% analog with digital being used as an instrument not a crutch. In a world of Pro-tools being used with &#34;perfect pitch&#34; control and easy editing, that even make the worst sound tolerable. The Foo Fighters studio is a studio for musicians! There is a soundtrack you can buy separately, that has all the collaborations done in this documentary towards the end of the film. With the likes of Sir Paul McCartney standing in for the late Kurt Cobain in a sort of &#34;Nirvana 2.0&#34;, Rick Neilsen of Cheap Trick, Stevie Nicks, Rick Springfield, Trent Reznor and of course all of those marvelous Foo's!

1621487,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00B2YH7BS,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","For first time director Dave Grohl, this documentary was certainly a labor of love.  And that feeling resonates throughout this film.  Grohl currently with Foo Fighters and other collaborations, cut his musical teeth with the acclaimed Nirvana.  They first recorded in the Van Nuys, California legendary studio, Sound City.Grohl takes us back to the early days (late `60's) where their first customers were Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham (""Nicks Buckingham"" album).  Later, Mick Fleetwood of British blues band Fleetwood Mac remembered hearing the duo at the studio as he was scouting recording sites in the U. S.  That led to the combination that became music icons.  This and many similar stories are introduced along with the people involved, musicians and the talented owners and employees of the studio.Even after computers and digital technology began to transform the music business, analog purists returned to Sound City which did little to change its ways.  This led to their eventually demise unfortunately.  Grohl for his part bought the one-of-a-kind mixing board that everyone loved.  The Neve's board is certainly a central character in the story and Grohl even interviews designer Rupert Neve who provides technical rationale for the design which sails right past Dave's head.  He supplies some hilarious subtitles as to what he was thinking.The film has its share of emotional moments as the studio is in its last throws but perhaps the most poignant is when Rick Springfield reminisces about his relationship with Joe Gottfried who guided Springfield's early career.  Springfield unexpectedly left for greener pastures which caused great distress to Gottfried who died in 1991.  This is a wonderful documentary, crafted with care and includes interviews with some of the greats in rock `n roll most of whom are still at it.  Watch for it on the Oscar list next January.The fine 1080p transfer comes with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and looks very good.  Much of the film includes archival segments include amateur tape, VHS and other.  It is about as good as it gets.  There is no use of compression that I could identify.  Colors and clarity are good.

Seems to be totally un-jaded, his enthusiasm for the subject of The Studio is boundless, and he's pretty funny to boot. The heartbeat of the True Believer drives this film and it's what I love about it.Documentaries like this can be hit-or-miss, especially where music is concerned; frankly, a lot of them suck. I approached this with caution, having been disappointed in other labors of love like the recent Big Star film, but my badittude was totally unwarranted. It grabbed me at the opening sequence. I know squat about the nuts and bolts of film making, but this felt high-budget to me--not only is it pleasantly glossy, but it's sequenced really beautifully, the whole narrative flowing along while still allowing for plenty of long geeky shots of the interiors of recording rooms, the reels of the Studers and Ampexes spinning, and the battle-ship beauty of Neve modules. The interviews are excellent,  having rounded up a crew of Sound City a-listers like Stevie Nicks, Neil Young and Tom Petty, all of whom have studio stories that will interest Fanboys/Audio Nerds and normal human beings alike. The film neatly walks the fine line of discussing the studio technology while never devolving into a discussion about the relative merits of various Neve modules or the Great Studer versus Ampex debate. It's always about the human beings involved.Some have complained about the last segment of the film, with the various Sound City vets (and Sir Paul) making a record with Dave at his studio, but I don't know what they're on about. Who wouldn't want to be a fly on the wall and get to watch an exceptionally talented bunch of musicians, engineers, and producing-types collaborating, working up new material, running down arrangements and generally having a good time in a beautiful studio? Granted, it's a little weird to see my man Paul getting all alt-rocky, ditto to Rick Springfield, but so what if the tunes are only meh? Anyone who's been lucky enough to get to spend time in the studio as a musician knows the feeling and will relate to what's going on in that room, even if it sometimes seems like, Sir Paul included, everyone except Trent Reznor sounds like they're really smitten with The Foo Fighters.",5,Way better than I had any right to expect,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,2424,"['Let', 'preface', 'saying', 'Dave', 'Grohl', 'one', 'Good', 'Guys', 'true', 'fan', 'got', 'great', 'taste', 'what', 'b-side', 'single', 'big', 'heart', 'upbeat', 'attitude', 'excellent', 'musician', 'be', 'totally', 'un-jaded', 'enthusiasm', 'subject', 'Studio', 'boundless', 'pretty', 'funny', 'boot', 'heartbeat', 'True', 'Believer', 'film', 'what', 'love', 'it.Documentaries', 'can', 'be', 'hit-or-miss', 'especially', 'where', 'music', 'concerned', 'frankly', 'lot', 'suck', 'approached', 'caution', 'having', 'been', 'disappointed', 'other', 'labors', 'love', 'recent', 'Big', 'Star', 'film', 'badittude', 'was', 'totally', 'unwarranted', 'grabbed', 'opening', 'sequence', 'know', 'squat', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'film', 'making', 'felt', 'high-budget', 'not', 'only', 'pleasantly', 'glossy', 'sequenced', 'really', 'beautifully', 'whole', 'narrative', 'flowing', 'still', 'allowing', 'plenty', 'long', 'geeky', 'shots', 'interiors', 'recording', 'rooms', 'reels', 'Studers', 'Ampexes', 'spinning', 'battle-ship', 'beauty', 'Neve', 'modules', 'interviews', 'are', 'excellent', 'having', 'rounded', 'up', 'crew', 'Sound', 'City', 'a-listers', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'Neil', 'Young', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'whom', 'have', 'studio', 'stories', 'will', 'interest', 'Fanboys/Audio', 'Nerds', 'normal', 'human', 'beings', 'alike', 'film', 'neatly', 'fine', 'line', 'discussing', 'studio', 'technology', 'never', 'devolving', 'discussion', 'relative', 'merits', 'various', 'Neve', 'modules', 'Great', 'Studer', 'versus', 'Ampex', 'debate', 'always', 'human', 'beings', 'involved.Some', 'have', 'complained', 'last', 'segment', 'film', 'various', 'Sound', 'City', 'vets', 'Sir', 'Paul', 'making', 'record', 'Dave', 'studio', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'fly', 'wall', 'get', 'watch', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'bunch', 'musicians', 'engineers', 'producing-types', 'collaborating', 'working', 'up', 'new', 'material', 'running', 'down', 'arrangements', 'generally', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'beautiful', 'studio', 'Granted', 'little', 'weird', 'see', 'man', 'Paul', 'getting', 'alt-rocky', 'ditto', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'so', 'what', 'tunes', 'are', 'only', 'meh', 'Anyone', 'who', 'been', 'lucky', 'enough', 'get', 'spend', 'time', 'studio', 'musician', 'feeling', 'will', 'relate', 'what', 'going', 'room', 'even', 'sometimes', 'Sir', 'Paul', 'included', 'everyone', 'Trent', 'Reznor', ""'re"", 'really', 'smitten', 'Foo', 'Fighters']",Sound City

The guy is a rock 'n' roll renaissance man who gives every different project his all in a genuinely passionate way that rubs off on others. The review I read about ""Sound City"" after it came out wasn't all that flattering, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it's a quality movie, with a solid soundtrack to accompany it. Grohl obviously has the connections to interview hugely successful artists, and that's what he does. I like how he sits back and lets others tell a large part of the tale, drawing out vivid behind-the-scenes descriptions of a proudly analog world.Sound City Studios -- and its soundboard, an instrument unto itself -- was once a dilapidated recording mecca for some of the most famous artists and albums of all time. As the diverse slew of rockers and studio employees personally relate the place's history and ups and downs, you can't help but hope that the good, organically created music will continue to be churned out forever. It isn't, of course, but Grohl, in an amazingly endearing way, helps makes sure that at least a part of the studio's history lives on. (I won't give away what he does.)The movie glosses over the 1980s heavy metal bands that recorded at Sound City rather quickly, which is too bad. Still, it relates in detail the musical transition during that time to compact discs, drum machines, sequencers, synthesizers and the infancy of digitally created sounds. As if to offset this wave of technology, Grohl makes his presence felt on the other side of the camera, collaborating with classic artists on new music (with a remnant from Sound City Studios).From Trent Reznor and Paul McCartney to Stevie Nicks and former Nirvana bass player Krist Novoselic (who it was great to see), ""Sound City"" comes alive with music that feels both spontaneous and professional. Watching artists like Reznor, McCartney, Grohl, Nicks, Josh Homme and Rick Springfield hammer out compositions is a real treat, and it proves that talent and camaraderie beat out Pro Tools and digitized playback any day of the week.For Grohl, the story touchingly turned out to be a full-circle experience that he relates with both glee and a sentimental heart.

1621550,AZMZB6YUWIBGV,B00B2YH7BS,Za09,"[0, 0]","I think Dave Grohl has just done a splendid job on this documentary. He's been able to explain to the uninitiated &#8220;why&#8221; a certain recording environment attains a &#8220;presence&#8221; that is unique.I was one of the guitarists of a hard rock progressive band signed to a major label and, we were at Sound City at the same time that Fleetwood Mac was recording the &#8220;Rumors&#8221; album. They, were in the big studio, we were in the &#8220;smaller&#8221; studio. Both studios had Neve consoles.My reaction, when I first walked in the Sound City building, was exactly as many of the others in the documentary stated... &#8220;Is this place for real? It looks like a dump&#8221;. When one of the interviewees recalls, &#8220;At Sound City, we always said if someone pissed in the corner, nobody would care&#8221; that is exactly how I felt too. It was grungy. You had to really &#8220;trust&#8221; that it was worth it to be in that kind of &#8220;place&#8221; to record. So... was it worth it? Well, we came out with a good album, the engineers were good, the technical folks were dependable, so... I guess, the answer would be &#8220;Yes&#8221; but, I would much rather have been at one of the more upscale studios like... Electric Ladyland?Was it the -greatest- recording studio in the world? That claim, is made out of nostalgia. There are numerous other studios around the world that could make that claim too.The &#8220;studio&#8220; does not make a band great, it helps, but it is the songwriting and the artists &#8220;vision&#8220; of how they want their music to sound. It is a totally different animal from performing live. The difference between a &#8220;live&#8220; performance and a studio recording is night-and-day.Following are some facts (in regards to analog) that most audience/fans may not be aware of:1 &#8211; being in a studio can be hell... a lot of stress... a lot of pressure to &#8220;produce&#8220; creativity...heavy expectations especially if you are being backed by big bucks2 &#8211; a LOT of waiting around, waiting around more, and then, even MORE waiting aroundWaiting around for what?* in an &#8220;analog&#8220; studio like Sound City, you wait to the equipment to be turned on and warm up, you wait for the technician (usually permanently onsite) to perform &#8220;alignment&#8221; procedures on all of the tape machines* then, you wait for the engineer to bring up the song and reset all of the channel &#8220;sliders&#8220; to the proper volume level, then wait for the engineer and assistant engineer to reset all the levels of the &#8220;outboard&#8220; effects units (like compressors, limiters, EQ etc) &#8211; then, you may have to wait for miking levels to be re-established on all of the guitar/bass amps and drum levels to be re-checked (if your record company &#8220;block booked&#8221; contiguous days/weeks in a row you, possibly, may not have to wait so long)* then, you wait for whoever has to do overdubs such as, guitar leads, vocals, background vocals etc until it's your turn and then, everybody has to wait for you and... during overdubs, EVERYONE has to wait for the tape units to be rewound back to the &#34;punch in&#34; point* then, you all go back into the Control Room and wait as the tape machines rewind to the beginning for playback and... believe me, when you're running 2 inch tape with 16-24 tracks, it takes a good bit of time for a &#8220;listen back&#8221;* then, if it is agreed that something can be done better, you wait for the tape machines to be repositioned to the &#8220;punch in points&#8220; and start all over again &#8211; sound creative? It is, but you have to reset/steel your mind and get it back in top-focus and concentration each and every time until you get it right.Oh yes... how about waiting 4-5 hours to get the initial drum sound? Yes... it IS worth it but it's very tough waiting.I recall one night, we were in the middle of a recording session and the tape machine had problems. The technician was called into the room and he announced he had to replace some part and then realign the tape heads. He said it would take 1-2 hours so he suggested we go out and get something to eat and come back. When we returned, about an hour and a half later, we were told the problem was more extensive than they first thought and that the session was &#8220;over&#8221; for that night. We were told to go home, get some sleep and after we had breakfast the next morning, to come back BUT... they stressed that we should CALL first! It certainly was a &#8220;creative letdown but... what could you do? You were at the mercy of analog. That type of situation rarely happens in the digital domain.The bottom line is, &#8220;waiting&#8220; is synonymous with analog/tape recording... AND the analog environment incurs a LOT of downtime and costs great $$ to maintain equipment. Do you really believe that Dave Grohl performs the alignments on his machines before and after every single recording session (as is required to assure tip-top performance)?Do you think he takes apart channel strips, amps, tape machines and repairs, solders and replaces parts and/or whole sections of electronics if/when required?Good technicians, especially those with analog experience, are VERY highly paid nowadays.We, &#8220;laptop&#8221;, musicians could NEVER afford those costs. An analog/tape environment takes so long to get at what musical artists want to get at most quickly, CREATIVITY! The &#8220;laptop&#8221; DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) environment allows me to get to creativity IMMEDIATELY!Even if I could afford to record at Grohl's Neve console, I would rather record in the digital domain, sitting at my kitchen table, looking out my picture window at our high desert view than have to endure going down into some dark, dank &#8220;Control Room&#8221; and... WAIT and WAIT and WAIT.Neil Young (and I have great respect for Neil Young) claims that they got the algorithm wrong when they wrote and standardized the &#8220;conversion&#8221; code to create digital wave forms based on experience with analog wave form analysis. I disagree. I guarantee you that NOBODY, no matter WHAT their technical expertise or experience could tell the difference between a well produced (not overblown) digital recording of today and another done in an analog studio AND, I can almost assure you that if there WAS a discernible difference, it would be the digital that comes out on top.People in the documentary state that &#8220;Now, anybody with a laptop can produce music&#8221; - that... is true, however, what they are smugly referring to is that, in their opinions, people who are &#8220;not worthy&#8221; are able to produce their own recordings.Well... I liken the music recording environment of today like this:Back in &#8220;the day&#8221; when you had to go up against the &#8220;big guy&#8221; or &#8220;bully&#8221; (i.e. the Record Companies)well... ya couldn't do it... YOU were the 90lb weakling because it took great $$ and extensive expertise to make a decent recording.Today, thankfully, those of us who do NOT have the big bucks now have our &#8220;equalizers&#8221; to counter them with, our laptops! Today, we don't HAVE to go to a record company and beg for recognition. We don't have to acquire big bucks or suck up to someone &#8220;in the know&#8221; who just might smile upon us to give us our &#8220;big break&#8221;. We can do it without ANYONE's help... all by ourselves. We don't even need other musicians to make an album.I will tell you one other thing... I am a musician and songwriter and always will be... that being said, I will tell you that 99% of ALL musicians are a##holes. They are NOT dependable, they are NOT people I even really want to associate with thus, I now have my laptop, REAPER DAW, EZ Drummer, basses, guitars, keyboards and I LOVE the freedom I have. Us &#8220;laptop&#8221; songwriters approach our recordings very much like a film composer would/does. Formally trained composers write their music down for other musicians to read and play however, the &#8220;composer&#8221; always has, and always will, compose it all in their heads without any outside interferences. As Mozart once stated &#8220;It's all in my head... the rest is just scribbling and bibbling&#8221; Digital allows us to achieve our musical visions we hear in our heads almost instantaneously.Sound City pooh-poohed the coming of the digital revolution. They would still be here today if they would have turned over one of their studios to digital and left the big studio analog. Analog is dead, Long Live Analog!I know this &#8220;review&#8221; if very verbose but, I couldn't write it any other way.Those that Rock nowadays, Rock Digital &#8211; Kick Out the JAMS!!!",5,All that is analog is great?
