Yes, gay vampires/witches are running a sex club called ""The Lair""  that is actually a front for more sinister activities. Newspaper journalist Thom (David Moretti) investigates a series of ""John Doe Murders"" linked to The Lair.  Vampire Lord Damien (Peter Stickles) discovers that Thom looks like the reincarnation of his  former lover, whom he betrayed, 200 years ago. Fellow vampire Colin (Dylan Vox) sees this as the perfect opportunity to bring about Damien's downfall.""The Lair"" is campy and gratuitous. There's lots of sex and nudity thrown in for, mostly,  no good reason-- except, perhaps-- it is included because you can do that on cable. The acting and dialogue are, mostly, terrible. So, why am I giving ""The Lair"" three stars? Because I think it's good, campy, gay fun. It's all over the top; and I think that was the intention. Plus, Stickles and Vox do exude the necessary charisma and sex appeal in the lead vampire roles. Vox's Colin, looking like a carbon copy of Kiefer Sutherland in ""The Lost Boys"", is a sexy, smarmy brat who can't wait to usurp Damien's/Stickles' power.If you're an adult who wants some campy, sexy fun, instead of scares, for Halloween, I do recommend these six episodes of ""The Lair."" Just enjoy it for what it is; but don't expect anything else.

1094160,A1DA6E4FNRSAWN,B000UAE7NQ,Furio,"[5, 7]","As far as entertainment goes this is not the worst serial I have ever come accross but it smells rank like lost opportunities.Set somewhere in the US, presumably along the coast in a not too large town, the serial -each episode ends with a cliffhanger- tries to mesh small town thriller, vampire flair, soft core gay sex and some social issues in the pot of gay subculture and underworld.All this is done by a very low budget: in a time when we are accustomed to expensive special effects this forces the viewer to adjust his expectations, but personally speaking I do not find it too difficult,provided the other forces at play are up to the task.Here such forces cannot be rated too highly but the general result is acceptable. More or less.The first thing I wish to pinpoint is that the six short (about half an hour) episodes that make up the first ""season"" are unfortunately divided in two, the first three being by far better done.In the second part, where atmosphere creation, settings establishing and character building leaves the place to action, the script becomes much more hurried; acting, filming and direction become less and less convincing as if time and money had been at an end by then.Not that acting or script were THAT good in the first place: one can hardly point out an original scene or conversation; as far as actors are concerned, the only one I could watch with no complaint was Beverly Lynne -the only woman- as Laura: she is pretty, she has a pleasant voice and appears at ease in front of the camera. Truth to be told she is served with the best character and by the best lines of the script.Former gay porn star Colton Ford as the Sheriff is such a handsome stud as to make one nearly forget the silly lines he is given: he does not appear to have had a great training as an actor but he can be watched without pain and I am not telling this because he is gorgeous: he is the only main character in the show who is always fully dressed.Brian Nolan would not be bad were he not constantly over the top.Dylan Vox as Colin has some good moments, especially when he manages to keep his voice soft and expressive, elsewhere he is mediocre and not quite as handsome as most of the cast -body builders, all buff, all quite attractive_ is.Jesse Cutlip and David Moretti are simply there, they pronounce their lines and that is all. Though I suppose they could be considered good looking, even their looks left me cold.Peter Stickles was presumably cast because of his actor skills, being far from handsome, but his performance is convincing only at times and sounds overwrought or shabby everywhere else.This serial can be entertaining if watched with little expectations and no intermission between the six parts. It can be a couple of hours of simple fun spoilt by the the rather longish previews and by the sloppy production and editing: one reviewer has rightly mentioned wounds that move from one spot to the other but this is not the worst slip by far.",2,could have been worse,1211500800,"05 23, 2008",2008,2982,"['As', 'far', 'entertainment', 'not', 'worst', 'serial', 'have', 'ever', 'come', 'accross', 'rank', 'lost', 'opportunities.Set', 'somewhere', 'US', 'presumably', 'coast', 'not', 'too', 'large', 'town', 'serial', '-each', 'episode', 'cliffhanger-', 'tries', 'mesh', 'small', 'town', 'thriller', 'vampire', 'flair', 'soft', 'core', 'gay', 'sex', 'social', 'issues', 'pot', 'gay', 'subculture', 'underworld.All', 'done', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'time', 'when', 'are', 'accustomed', 'expensive', 'special', 'effects', 'viewer', 'adjust', 'expectations', 'personally', 'speaking', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'too', 'difficult', 'provided', 'other', 'forces', 'play', 'are', 'up', 'task.Here', 'such', 'forces', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'rated', 'too', 'highly', 'general', 'result', 'acceptable', 'More', 'less.The', 'first', 'thing', 'wish', 'pinpoint', 'six', 'short', 'hour', 'make', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'divided', 'two', 'first', 'three', 'being', 'far', 'better', 'done.In', 'second', 'part', 'where', 'atmosphere', 'creation', 'settings', 'establishing', 'character', 'building', 'place', 'action', 'script', 'much', 'more', 'hurried', 'acting', 'filming', 'direction', 'become', 'less', 'less', 'convincing', 'time', 'money', 'had', 'been', 'end', 'then.Not', 'acting', 'script', 'were', 'THAT', 'good', 'first', 'place', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'point', 'out', 'original', 'scene', 'conversation', 'as', 'far', 'actors', 'are', 'concerned', 'only', 'one', 'could', 'watch', 'complaint', 'was', 'Beverly', 'Lynne', '-the', 'only', 'woman-', 'Laura', 'pretty', 'pleasant', 'voice', 'ease', 'front', 'camera', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'served', 'best', 'character', 'best', 'lines', 'script.Former', 'gay', 'porn', 'star', 'Colton', 'Ford', 'Sheriff', 'such', 'handsome', 'stud', 'make', 'one', 'nearly', 'forget', 'silly', 'lines', 'given', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'training', 'actor', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'pain', 'am', 'not', 'telling', 'gorgeous', 'only', 'main', 'character', 'show', 'who', 'always', 'fully', 'dressed.Brian', 'Nolan', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'were', 'not', 'constantly', 'top.Dylan', 'Vox', 'Colin', 'good', 'moments', 'especially', 'when', 'keep', 'voice', 'soft', 'expressive', 'elsewhere', 'mediocre', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'handsome', 'most', 'cast', '-body', 'builders', 'buff', 'quite', 'attractive_', 'is.Jesse', 'Cutlip', 'David', 'Moretti', 'are', 'simply', 'there', 'pronounce', 'lines', 'suppose', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'good', 'looking', 'even', 'looks', 'left', 'cold.Peter', 'Stickles', 'was', 'presumably', 'cast', 'actor', 'skills', 'being', 'far', 'handsome', 'performance', 'convincing', 'only', 'times', 'sounds', 'overwrought', 'shabby', 'everywhere', 'else.This', 'serial', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'watched', 'little', 'expectations', 'intermission', 'six', 'parts', 'can', 'be', 'couple', 'hours', 'simple', 'fun', 'spoilt', 'rather', 'longish', 'previews', 'sloppy', 'production', 'editing', 'one', 'reviewer', 'rightly', 'mentioned', 'wounds', 'move', 'one', 'spot', 'other', 'not', 'worst', 'slip', 'far']",The Lair: Season 1
