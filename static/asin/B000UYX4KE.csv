1097610,A1A3485UTN4SS,B000UYX4KE,The Delite Rancher,"[8, 8]","""Mojave Phone Booth"" is the dramatization of a real phenomenon. Located in Mojave National Preserve, the phone booth became popular as strangers called to talk to the strangers who drove to the remote booth. Spread through the Mojave Phone Booth Project's web page, the experience brought together people from all over the world. The cult following is yet another testament to desert weirdness. Indeed, my curiosity in the film is based on an interest in the eccentric things that people do in dry places. As for the actual movie, I enjoyed it. Set in Las Vegas, the story brings together seemingly unrelated characters. Told in separate chapters, the stories ultimately tie together. In this respect, the plot's architecture is similar to ""Crash."" The story has a creepy, existential mood. The central theme is communication. The main characters all suffer from an inability to effectively communicate within their interpersonal relationships. In this sense, the dilapidated phone booth is a metaphor for the flick's theme. In regards to the characters, they are at times unbelievable and surprisingly unsympathetic. Despite such issues, the film is strangely captivating. The postmodern storytelling really keeps you hanging on to figure out how everything will finish. The DVD's extras contain a few enjoyable vignettes such as a piece about the real phone booth. As far as authenticity goes, the characters are purely fictional and most who made the trek out to the booth didn't come from Vegas but LA. Not to be taken as historically accurate, this is about entertainment. The mythology of the actual phone booth lends the film a uniquely interesting premise. All in all, ""Mojave Phone Booth"" is entertaining and wonderfully weird.",4,"pick up the phone, you'll want to take this call",1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,1736,"['Mojave', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'dramatization', 'real', 'phenomenon', 'Located', 'Mojave', 'National', 'Preserve', 'phone', 'booth', 'became', 'popular', 'strangers', 'called', 'talk', 'strangers', 'who', 'drove', 'remote', 'booth', 'Mojave', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'Project', 'web', 'page', 'experience', 'brought', 'together', 'people', 'world', 'cult', 'following', 'yet', 'testament', 'desert', 'weirdness', 'Indeed', 'curiosity', 'film', 'based', 'interest', 'eccentric', 'things', 'people', 'do', 'dry', 'places', 'actual', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'Set', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'story', 'together', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'characters', 'Told', 'separate', 'chapters', 'stories', 'ultimately', 'tie', 'together', 'respect', 'plot', 'architecture', 'similar', 'Crash', 'story', 'creepy', 'existential', 'mood', 'central', 'theme', 'communication', 'main', 'characters', 'suffer', 'inability', 'effectively', 'communicate', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'sense', 'dilapidated', 'phone', 'booth', 'metaphor', 'flick', 'theme', 'regards', 'characters', 'are', 'times', 'unbelievable', 'surprisingly', 'unsympathetic', 'such', 'issues', 'film', 'strangely', 'captivating', 'postmodern', 'storytelling', 'really', 'hanging', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'everything', 'will', 'finish', 'DVD', 'extras', 'contain', 'few', 'enjoyable', 'vignettes', 'such', 'piece', 'real', 'phone', 'booth', 'As', 'far', 'authenticity', 'characters', 'are', 'purely', 'fictional', 'most', 'who', 'made', 'trek', 'booth', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'Vegas', 'LA', 'Not', 'be', 'taken', 'historically', 'accurate', 'entertainment', 'mythology', 'actual', 'phone', 'film', 'uniquely', 'interesting', 'premise', 'Mojave', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'entertaining', 'wonderfully', 'weird']",Mojave Phone Booth
