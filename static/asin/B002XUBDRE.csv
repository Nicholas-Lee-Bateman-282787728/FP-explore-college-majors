1298740,A30TQET02FLSUX,B002XUBDRE,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[0, 2]","Sometimes I think it may seem to others like I only watch more ""mainstream"" big budget Hollywood movies and less of the small controversial indies. But I really do watch a variety of films that interest me regardless of who made them, who's in them, how much they were made for, or whether they had box office success.  It's the story that is most important to me.  I love a well made $200 million summer blockbuster as much as the next person, but I also love a well-crafted little indie film shot for pennies on the dollar compared to what James Cameron & Michael Bay get for budgets.DVD and the internet have been the best thing to happen to small films in my opinion. They've made these films accessible to people in the comfort and privacy of their home where they can enjoy these stories that they might not pay $10 to see in a theater, assuming they could even find a theater showing them. Dare (2009) is a small movie that fits into this category. When I first heard about this movie because of its appearance at Sundance in 2009, I was intrigued by the story and wanted to watch it. Who doesn't like a ""coming-of-age"" story.  There are hundreds of them out there in books, movies, television, and music.  We've all come of age and know the difficulties of that process.  And we seem to love to reminisce about it as we get older...in both positive and negative ways.Actor Zach Gilford, the ""star"" of Dare, was introduced to me in the TV show Friday Night Lights and I thought he was very good in that show, so seeing his name on this movie certainly helped. Dare came out in theaters at the end of last year and didn't see much box office moola. But it was recently released on DVD and Netflix Instant Viewing, where I watched it recently...which by the way, is part of the future of movies. Having on-demand access at your TV in your Living Room to anything and everything at anytime, like iTunes has done for music, is where movie distribution is going IMO. Goodbye to the DVD and Blu-Ray discs as soon as we get the bandwidth issues resolved on the internet.Anyways, back to Dare. Dare is basically a story about 3 high school seniors finding themselves in their final year of high school and before they become ""adults"".  Johnny, as played by Zach Gilford, is the ""popular"" jock-type rich kid that seems to always be in these tales, but he's really not that guy, as we discover through the journey of the film.  Johnny is actually a depressed and lonely lost soul whose lack of parental involvement in his life has taken a toll on his psyche.  He has lots of ""friends"", but he doesn't have a connection with any of them seemingly because they are all too shallow and fake.  He's searching for real people to have a real connection with and whom he can share his desire to love and feel loved with.  Love is what has been missing from his young life.Alexa is the repressed girl who hasn't really expressed herself or allowed herself to experience anything outside of what she was told to do.  She's yearning to experience life and to take risks and be bold, simply I think so that she can know how those things feel.  She wants to feel like she's living her life. And finally, Ben is the awkward nerdy guy who doesn't have many friends, isn't popular, and is hiding from being gay.  His best friend is Alexa, whom he's known since they were young kids.All three of these characters are on that search for who they are and how to be themselves.  As part of Alexa's journey, she decides to go after Johnny and become the girl Johnny normally goes for.  Seeing that transformation in Alexa, Ben decides to do the same...with Johnny as well.  So a love triangle and friendship triangle ensues for the three of them.  The movie is divided into 3 acts, each act focused on telling the intertwined stories of these three people from the point of view of each of them.What was interesting to me about this story was that I was able to relate to all three characters, each in a different way.  There was a part of my story, and I'm assuming this is true for most people, in each of these teenagers.  But Johnny and his 3rd-act story was the one that I connected most powerfully with, certainly by design I think from Director Adam Salky.  Being lost and confused in so many ways in his life, Johnny is who represents young men today in my opinion.  Women have been on an incredible journey to equality in our culture, but at the same time, the roles of men and the expectations of who they should be have changed dramatically in the past 40 years.  And I think that young men are having a harder time right now finding their place in our new culture of strong and empowered women.  Don't get me wrong, I'm 100% supportive of strong women's rights and equality within society, but not at the sacrifice of the same thing for men.  I think the scales have tilted from men to women and that we are in search of balance now.  And as a young man, Johnny represents this new confusing journey that we men are going through.  And that is what I connected with in the story of Dare.",3,Three Act Journey,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,5076,"['Sometimes', 'think', 'may', 'seem', 'others', 'only', 'watch', 'more', 'mainstream', 'big', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'less', 'small', 'controversial', 'indies', 'really', 'do', 'watch', 'variety', 'films', 'interest', 'regardless', 'who', 'made', 'who', 'how', 'much', 'were', 'made', 'had', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'story', 'most', 'important', 'love', 'well', 'made', '200', 'million', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'person', 'also', 'love', 'well-crafted', 'little', 'indie', 'film', 'shot', 'pennies', 'dollar', 'compared', 'what', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'get', 'budgets.DVD', 'internet', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'thing', 'happen', 'small', 'films', 'opinion', ""'ve"", 'made', 'films', 'accessible', 'people', 'comfort', 'privacy', 'home', 'where', 'can', 'enjoy', 'stories', 'might', 'not', 'pay', '10', 'see', 'theater', 'assuming', 'could', 'even', 'find', 'theater', 'showing', 'Dare', '2009', 'small', 'movie', 'category', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'appearance', 'Sundance', '2009', 'was', 'intrigued', 'story', 'wanted', 'watch', 'Who', ""n't"", 'like', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'are', 'hundreds', 'out', 'there', 'books', 'movies', 'television', 'music', ""'ve"", 'come', 'age', 'know', 'difficulties', 'process', 'seem', 'love', 'reminisce', 'about', 'get', 'older', 'positive', 'negative', 'ways.Actor', 'Zach', 'Gilford', 'star', 'Dare', 'was', 'introduced', 'TV', 'show', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'seeing', 'name', 'movie', 'certainly', 'helped', 'Dare', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'end', 'last', 'year', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'box', 'office', 'moola', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'DVD', 'Netflix', 'Instant', 'Viewing', 'where', 'watched', 'recently', 'way', 'part', 'future', 'movies', 'Having', 'on-demand', 'access', 'TV', 'Living', 'Room', 'anything', 'everything', 'anytime', 'iTunes', 'done', 'music', 'where', 'movie', 'distribution', 'going', 'IMO', 'Goodbye', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'discs', 'as', 'soon', 'get', 'bandwidth', 'issues', 'resolved', 'internet.Anyways', 'back', 'Dare', 'Dare', 'basically', 'story', '3', 'high', 'school', 'seniors', 'finding', 'final', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'become', 'adults', 'Johnny', 'played', 'Zach', 'Gilford', 'popular', 'jock-type', 'rich', 'kid', 'always', 'be', 'tales', 'really', 'not', 'guy', 'discover', 'journey', 'film', 'Johnny', 'actually', 'depressed', 'lonely', 'lost', 'soul', 'lack', 'parental', 'involvement', 'life', 'taken', 'toll', 'psyche', 'lots', 'friends', ""n't"", 'have', 'connection', 'seemingly', 'are', 'too', 'shallow', 'fake', 'searching', 'real', 'people', 'have', 'real', 'connection', 'whom', 'can', 'share', 'desire', 'love', 'feel', 'loved', 'Love', 'been', 'missing', 'young', 'life.Alexa', 'repressed', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'expressed', 'allowed', 'experience', 'anything', 'what', 'was', 'told', 'do', 'yearning', 'experience', 'life', 'take', 'risks', 'be', 'bold', 'simply', 'think', 'so', 'can', 'know', 'how', 'things', 'feel', 'feel', 'living', 'life', 'finally', 'Ben', 'awkward', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'friends', ""n't"", 'popular', 'hiding', 'being', 'gay', 'best', 'friend', 'Alexa', 'whom', 'known', 'were', 'young', 'kids.All', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'search', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'be', 'part', 'Alexa', 'journey', 'go', 'Johnny', 'become', 'girl', 'Johnny', 'normally', 'Seeing', 'transformation', 'Alexa', 'Ben', 'do', 'same', 'Johnny', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'triangle', 'friendship', 'triangle', 'ensues', 'three', 'movie', 'divided', '3', 'acts', 'act', 'focused', 'telling', 'intertwined', 'stories', 'three', 'people', 'point', 'view', 'was', 'interesting', 'story', 'was', 'was', 'able', 'relate', 'three', 'characters', 'different', 'way', 'was', 'part', 'story', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'true', 'most', 'people', 'teenagers', 'Johnny', '3rd-act', 'story', 'was', 'one', 'connected', 'most', 'powerfully', 'certainly', 'design', 'think', 'Director', 'Adam', 'Salky', 'Being', 'lost', 'confused', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'life', 'Johnny', 'who', 'young', 'men', 'today', 'opinion', 'Women', 'have', 'been', 'incredible', 'journey', 'equality', 'culture', 'same', 'time', 'roles', 'men', 'expectations', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'have', 'changed', 'dramatically', 'past', '40', 'years', 'think', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'having', 'harder', 'time', 'right', 'now', 'finding', 'place', 'new', 'culture', 'strong', 'empowered', 'women', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", '100', '%', 'supportive', 'strong', 'women', 'rights', 'equality', 'society', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'same', 'thing', 'men', 'think', 'scales', 'have', 'tilted', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'search', 'balance', 'now', 'young', 'man', 'Johnny', 'new', 'confusing', 'journey', 'men', 'are', 'going', 'what', 'connected', 'story', 'Dare']",N/A

The tagline of that earlier film, ""One girl. Two guys. Three possibilities,"" might have been adopted for Dare as well. The elephant in the room is the excellent Dare (2005) short included on the Blu-ray disc. While the swimming pool ""dare"" scene that is most of the short also appears in the new film, it has been truncated for no obvious reason, and it is not one of the deleted scenes. The new film also suffers by comparison because the chemistry between Johnny and Ben seems stronger in the short.The new film is really not a gay film anymore. Alexa, who is peripheral to the short, drives the new film from the opening frames. Johnny's backstory of a distant father and a youthful stepmother certainly explains his vulnerability, but his friends are not privy to the same personal details the audience sees, and that sets up the somewhat unsatisfactory, though perhaps realistic, ending. Threesome, based on the college experiences of the director, was shot with an alternative ending that appeared on the 2001 release (unlike some male-male scenes that were cut and never seen) which also had problems. How do you resolve any threesome satisfactorily? We never learn how Johnny vanquished his personal demons except to see the sign on the door he enters in the last frames.Threesome has about the same rating as this film overall, but has more five-star votes than otherwise.

1298746,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B002XUBDRE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 7]","With its high school setting and the evocative title ""Dare,""  I was prepared for this film to be either a standard teenage romp or perhaps a cautionary tale about alienated youth causing mischief.  In fact, it is a rather sensitively wrought tale of conflicted emotions and youth struggling for identity.  Blurring lines between sex and friendship, ""Dare"" introduces a somewhat accidental threesome that is as intriguing as it is believable.  This non-traditional bond is purely unintentional with each party seeking something from the relationship that will never be fully realized.  Earnest, and even heartbreaking, the film grows more disturbing as it progresses--with the teens both liberating one another while causing emotional damage.The film is split into three parts--one to represent each of the young protagonists.  Emmy Rossum effectively plays an overachiever who doesn't quite click with the popular crowd.  When paired for an assignment with rebel jock Zach Gilford, she takes this as a chance to challenge the good girl expectations placed on her by advancing a sexual liaison with him.  Her best guy pal, Ashley Springer, is struggling with his own sexual identity--he's both jealous of the new couple and wanting some alone time with Gilford as well.  And Gilford, for his part, is much more troubled and complex than he seems and simply yearns for the closeness and normalcy of having real friends.  Soon something rather illicit is happening--but with all the conflicting expectations, it seems a recipe for disaster.All of the performances are terrific.  Springer and Rossum capture the push/pull dynamic of a close friendship.  Ana Gasteyer has a pivotal and effective role as Springer's mother, and Rooney Mara, Sandra Bernhard, and Alan Cumming lend able support.  But in many ways, the film belongs to Gilford--likable on Friday Night Lights, but displaying unexpected depth and poignancy here.  It is a star performance layered with complexity.  What I like most about ""Dare,"" ultimately, is that it is messy, emotional and confused.  It has much to say about contemporary relationships even in its unconventional and daring set-up.  All in all, this drama of teen angst is refreshingly adult!

I'm not sure I buy the premise but hey what do I know.  Yes, there's lots of talk and clothes-on action, but when the rubber meets the road, the cast and filmmakers cop out.

1298749,AZL8ZFJMYLSV3,B002XUBDRE,P. Walker,"[7, 10]","Dare is a wonderful film that forces you to realize that things are not always what they appear. Is Johnny gay? Is he straight? Is he bisexual? Well, we learn that it doesn't matter, in this case it's not important, it isn't about sex. Johnny is starved for true affection, wanting to matter, to be substantial in someone's heart, to be loved as a person, having come from a wealthy, but indifferent, family whom he rarely interacts with. Alexa and Ben, his new friends, are caught up in their own pursuits. Ben has a crush on Johnny to the point that it forces Ben out of the closet. Alexa is ambitious, but she's confused as to why she really finds Johnny attractive. She wants to be an actor and is drawn to those who have a natural gift for it. This film defies the labels we apply to ourselves and others in order for us to follow some safe stereotypical path, to create a sense of security for ourselves. We want to follow the road most travelled so that we can believe we are ""normal"". The problem arises in the trio's relationship when Johnny mistakes the interest that his friends show toward him for honest affection. And, as many young people do, Alexa and Ben are oblivious to what Johnny really needs, being consumed by their own goals. Sex really doesn't matter to Johnny and so it is left as a side issue and we never know what his true sexual inclination is. One of the most revealing and heartwarming moments in the film is when Ruth (Ana Gasteyer) is taken aback by Johnny's forwardness when he reacts to her genuine compassion with sincere affection and love. A great film that reveals the confusion of youthful pursuits stem from the innermost needs that we really have.",5,See people for who they really are.,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,1690,"['Dare', 'wonderful', 'film', 'realize', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'what', 'appear', 'Johnny', 'gay', 'straight', 'bisexual', 'Well', 'learn', ""n't"", 'matter', 'case', 'not', 'important', ""n't"", 'about', 'sex', 'Johnny', 'starved', 'true', 'affection', 'wanting', 'matter', 'be', 'substantial', 'someone', 'heart', 'be', 'loved', 'person', 'having', 'come', 'wealthy', 'indifferent', 'family', 'whom', 'rarely', 'Alexa', 'Ben', 'new', 'friends', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'pursuits', 'Ben', 'crush', 'Johnny', 'point', 'Ben', 'closet', 'Alexa', 'ambitious', 'confused', 'why', 'really', 'Johnny', 'attractive', 'be', 'actor', 'drawn', 'who', 'have', 'natural', 'gift', 'film', 'labels', 'apply', 'ourselves', 'others', 'order', 'follow', 'safe', 'stereotypical', 'path', 'create', 'sense', 'security', 'ourselves', 'want', 'follow', 'road', 'most', 'travelled', 'so', 'can', 'believe', 'are', 'normal', 'problem', 'trio', 'relationship', 'when', 'Johnny', 'interest', 'friends', 'show', 'honest', 'affection', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'do', 'Alexa', 'Ben', 'are', 'oblivious', 'what', 'Johnny', 'really', 'being', 'consumed', 'own', 'goals', 'Sex', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Johnny', 'so', 'left', 'side', 'issue', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'true', 'sexual', 'inclination', 'One', 'most', 'revealing', 'heartwarming', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'Ruth', 'Ana', 'Gasteyer', 'taken', 'aback', 'Johnny', 'forwardness', 'when', 'genuine', 'compassion', 'sincere', 'affection', 'love', 'great', 'film', 'confusion', 'youthful', 'pursuits', 'stem', 'innermost', 'really', 'have']",N/A

1298751,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002XUBDRE,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","In ""Dare,"" Alexa (played by the winning Emmy Rossum) is an inexperienced, socially inept teenaged actress who decides to become a ""bad girl"" so she'll be more in touch with the characters she`s playing (her current role is that of the world-weary Blanche Dubois in a high school production of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"").  Not only does this open up a whole new realm of experiences for the young lady herself, but it leads to a chain reaction for the two most important people in her life:  her geeky best friend, Ben (Ashley Springer), who becomes seemingly jealous when Alexi takes up with the school's brooding, arrogant jock, Johnny (Zach Gilford); and Johnny himself who reveals some surprising truths about himself before the story's over. ""Dare"" is all about the roles we take on at various points in our lives, and how different we can appear to the world once the masks we are wearing are stripped off - thereby making the theatrical context the story uses a metaphor for real life.Writer David Brind has divided his story into three parts, each focused on a different main character (Alexi comes first, followed by Ben, then Johnny).  Since this has been largely conceived and constructed as a parable, the narrative lacks credibility on occasion and the storytelling does become a bit heavy-handed at times, but some genuinely unexpected plot twists, a blunt and honest approach towards sex and sexuality, an intriguing look at the boundaries of friendship, and an overall complexity of character make the film difficult to dismiss out of hand.  In fact, its strangeness is probably its most compelling feature.  Brind and director Adam Salky are obviously going for something offbeat and unusual here, and it is all to the movie's advantage (""Dare"" is actually a fleshed-out version of a short film Salky made a few years earlier).Fans of ""Friday Night Lights"" will be intrigued at seeing Gilford in a role that appears at first blush to be diametrically opposed to the sweet and likable Matt Saracen he plays on the series, though, as the story progresses and more layers are peeled off the character, we discover that Matt and Johnny actually have quite a bit in common with one another - mainly their feeling that they are largely unloved and alone in the world (Matt just deals with it better).In addition to the three striking leads, Alan Cumming and Sandra Bernhard lend their support to the project in small but significant roles.Despite its imperfections, this tale of youthful self-discovery emerges as a thoughtful and insightful look at the often painful, confusing, fumbling - yet wholly necessary - efforts teenagers must go through to find their place in the world.",4,theater as metaphor,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,2692,"['Dare', 'Alexa', 'played', 'winning', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'inexperienced', 'socially', 'inept', 'teenaged', 'actress', 'who', 'become', 'bad', 'girl', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'touch', 'characters', 's', 'playing', 'current', 'role', 'world-weary', 'Blanche', 'Dubois', 'high', 'school', 'production', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Not', 'only', 'open', 'up', 'whole', 'new', 'realm', 'experiences', 'young', 'lady', 'chain', 'reaction', 'two', 'most', 'important', 'people', 'life', 'geeky', 'best', 'friend', 'Ben', 'Ashley', 'Springer', 'who', 'seemingly', 'jealous', 'when', 'Alexi', 'up', 'school', 'brooding', 'arrogant', 'jock', 'Johnny', 'Zach', 'Gilford', 'Johnny', 'who', 'surprising', 'truths', 'story', 'Dare', 'roles', 'take', 'various', 'points', 'lives', 'how', 'different', 'can', 'appear', 'world', 'masks', 'are', 'wearing', 'are', 'stripped', 'thereby', 'making', 'theatrical', 'context', 'story', 'metaphor', 'real', 'life.Writer', 'David', 'Brind', 'divided', 'story', 'three', 'parts', 'focused', 'different', 'main', 'character', 'Alexi', 'first', 'followed', 'Ben', 'then', 'Johnny', 'been', 'largely', 'conceived', 'constructed', 'parable', 'narrative', 'lacks', 'credibility', 'occasion', 'storytelling', 'become', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'times', 'genuinely', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'twists', 'blunt', 'honest', 'approach', 'towards', 'sex', 'sexuality', 'intriguing', 'look', 'boundaries', 'friendship', 'overall', 'complexity', 'character', 'make', 'film', 'difficult', 'dismiss', 'hand', 'fact', 'strangeness', 'probably', 'most', 'compelling', 'feature', 'Brind', 'director', 'Adam', 'Salky', 'are', 'obviously', 'going', 'something', 'offbeat', 'unusual', 'here', 'movie', 'advantage', 'Dare', 'actually', 'fleshed-out', 'version', 'short', 'film', 'Salky', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', '.Fans', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'will', 'be', 'intrigued', 'seeing', 'Gilford', 'role', 'first', 'blush', 'be', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'sweet', 'likable', 'Matt', 'Saracen', 'series', 'though', 'story', 'more', 'layers', 'are', 'peeled', 'off', 'character', 'discover', 'Matt', 'Johnny', 'actually', 'have', 'quite', 'bit', 'common', 'one', 'mainly', 'feeling', 'are', 'largely', 'unloved', 'alone', 'world', 'Matt', 'just', 'better', 'addition', 'three', 'striking', 'leads', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'Sandra', 'Bernhard', 'lend', 'support', 'project', 'small', 'significant', 'roles.Despite', 'imperfections', 'tale', 'youthful', 'self-discovery', 'emerges', 'thoughtful', 'insightful', 'look', 'often', 'painful', 'confusing', 'fumbling', 'yet', 'wholly', 'necessary', 'efforts', 'teenagers', 'must', 'go', 'find', 'place', 'world']",N/A
1298752,A25K1BQ8II6QSM,B002XUBDRE,R. T. Wilcoxon,"[1, 2]","Spoilers included below....The story is divided in to 3 parts.  First the good:It starts with Alexa the female lead...I will admit her story was a good start that peaked my interest.  She plays the eager overachiever that just doesn't fit in with the cool kids despite being fairly attractive and super intelligent.  She just isn't cool.  Her dream is to act.  A visting famous actor stops by school and sees her scene with cool kid bad boy Johnny...after the scene the actor tells Johnny he is great but really ignores Alexa.  She begs him for time after class to discuss her craft and he tells her she wasn't convincing because she has dared to step out of her box (always a straight student, who make the right choice but never really lived to convey the emotion).  So Alexa takes his challenge and dares to step out of her comfort zone.  Like I said I liked her story and it got me interested.Then the bad...The next story in Ben.  He appears to be in love with his best friend Alexa and is jealous of Johnny...but within his 30 minute story he completely changes and decides he is in love with Johnny and is jealous of Alexa...it an abrupt change that doesn't really explore any of the difficulties of someone determining they are gay or bi.  It also was done in such a way that was neither erotic or even interesting...Finally we have Johnny's story...at first he just appears to be the rich bad boy but in his story it appears that more than anything he is looking for family, friends, and love but he doesn't know how to get it.  While this is a compelling topic, it is handled so poorly.  For story that treads on the edges of sexual and erotic as well as have very serious issues and deep story, the movie misses both.  The actors have plenty of clothes on action but cut away before we get too erotic and the deeper themes are handled poorly...a completely forgettable movie in the end",2,Good start but falls quickly,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,1896,"['Spoilers', 'included', '.The', 'story', 'divided', '3', 'parts', 'First', 'good', 'Alexa', 'female', 'lead', 'will', 'admit', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'start', 'peaked', 'interest', 'eager', 'overachiever', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'cool', 'kids', 'being', 'fairly', 'attractive', 'super', 'intelligent', 'just', ""n't"", 'cool', 'dream', 'act', 'visting', 'famous', 'actor', 'stops', 'school', 'scene', 'cool', 'kid', 'bad', 'boy', 'Johnny', 'scene', 'actor', 'Johnny', 'great', 'really', 'Alexa', 'begs', 'time', 'class', 'discuss', 'craft', 'was', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'dared', 'step', 'out', 'box', 'always', 'straight', 'student', 'who', 'make', 'right', 'choice', 'never', 'really', 'lived', 'convey', 'emotion', 'Alexa', 'challenge', 'dares', 'step', 'out', 'comfort', 'zone', 'said', 'liked', 'story', 'got', 'interested.Then', 'bad', 'next', 'story', 'Ben', 'be', 'love', 'best', 'friend', 'Alexa', 'jealous', 'Johnny', '30', 'minute', 'story', 'completely', 'changes', 'decides', 'love', 'Johnny', 'jealous', 'Alexa', 'abrupt', 'change', ""n't"", 'really', 'explore', 'difficulties', 'someone', 'determining', 'are', 'gay', 'bi', 'also', 'was', 'done', 'such', 'way', 'was', 'erotic', 'even', 'interesting', 'Finally', 'have', 'Johnny', 'story', 'first', 'just', 'be', 'rich', 'bad', 'boy', 'story', 'more', 'anything', 'looking', 'family', 'friends', 'love', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'get', 'compelling', 'topic', 'handled', 'so', 'poorly', 'story', 'edges', 'sexual', 'erotic', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'very', 'serious', 'issues', 'deep', 'story', 'movie', 'actors', 'have', 'plenty', 'clothes', 'action', 'cut', 'away', 'get', 'too', 'erotic', 'deeper', 'themes', 'are', 'handled', 'poorly', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'movie', 'end']",N/A
