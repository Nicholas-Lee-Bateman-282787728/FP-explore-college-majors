A group of boat people land on Australia's shores with all their hopes.  They all face adversity in their own way as they move toward their hopes and dreams in a strange new land.  They are gently pursued by the authorities and all encounter serious obstacles and humorous situations.  Each character is well developed and well played.  If you are looking for high speed chases and special effects, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for more gentle adventure, I highly recommend this film.",4,"Hope, Adversity, Some Laughs",1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,558,"['entertaining', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'Australia', 'A', 'group', 'boat', 'people', 'land', 'Australia', 'shores', 'hopes', 'face', 'adversity', 'own', 'way', 'move', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'strange', 'new', 'land', 'are', 'gently', 'pursued', 'authorities', 'encounter', 'serious', 'obstacles', 'humorous', 'situations', 'character', 'well', 'developed', 'well', 'played', 'are', 'looking', 'high', 'speed', 'chases', 'special', 'effects', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'gentle', 'adventure', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",Lucky Miles [Region 4]

Stuck in the Outback with no food and miles from any settlement, an Arab immigrant is trying to get a broken down truck to be roadworthy, he struggles to remove and replace a flat tire only to find the replacement does not fit the hub. He throws a fit, throwing the wheeling, kicking the truck.
