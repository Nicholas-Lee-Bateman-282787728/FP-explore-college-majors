According to the film's director, William Friedkin, over 40-minutes of additional footage was cut from the original movie and has since disappeared. And though he would have liked to include the 40+-minutes on this dvd, Friedkin says that he feels that the movie is complete as is.For those who aren't familiar with this movie, it's about a New York city cop (Pacino) who goes undercover in the S&M;(Sado-masochism)/Leather subculture of the gay community looking for a serial killer who's targeting gay men. Even though he's a rookie, the cop is chosen for this assignment because he looks like most of the victims. The film is a gritty whodunnit and exposes an aspect of gay life that most will never see, and raises more questions than it answers. It can be very confusing at times and you never really know if the actual killer is caught; if the guy caught is the actual killer or if there's more than one.For those who are familiar with CRUISING, I just like to say that the porn frames are still in it. I thought that they would take them out because of the dvd transfer, but they didn't, which is good. The film looks sharp and there are some graphic enhancements that I don't remember being on the original video, but it doesn't take away anything from the movie.***Bonus Material******Friedkin's commentary***Two featurettes that total about 45-minutes and include interviews with some of the actors from ""Cruising,"" along with Friedkin (Pacino is not on it), which also talks about the controversy and backlash from the gay commmunity***Theatrical trailer",4,The Frames Are Still There!!!,1190764800,"09 26, 2007",2007,1669,"['CRUISING', 'DELUXE', 'EDITITON', 'dvd', 'restored', 'movie', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'new', 'According', 'film', 'director', 'William', 'Friedkin', '40-minutes', 'additional', 'footage', 'was', 'cut', 'original', 'movie', 'disappeared', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'include', '40+-minutes', 'dvd', 'Friedkin', 'movie', 'complete', 'is.For', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'movie', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'cop', 'Pacino', 'who', 'undercover', 'S', 'M', 'Sado-masochism', 'subculture', 'gay', 'community', 'looking', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'targeting', 'gay', 'men', 'Even', 'rookie', 'cop', 'chosen', 'assignment', 'most', 'victims', 'film', 'gritty', 'whodunnit', 'aspect', 'gay', 'life', 'most', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'more', 'questions', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'confusing', 'times', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'actual', 'killer', 'caught', 'guy', 'caught', 'actual', 'killer', 'more', 'one.For', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'CRUISING', 'just', 'say', 'porn', 'frames', 'are', 'still', 'thought', 'would', 'take', 'out', 'dvd', 'transfer', 'did', ""n't"", 'good', 'film', 'sharp', 'are', 'graphic', 'enhancements', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'being', 'original', 'video', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'anything', 'movie', 'Material******Friedkin', 'commentary***Two', 'total', '45-minutes', 'include', 'interviews', 'actors', 'Cruising', 'Friedkin', 'Pacino', 'not', 'also', 'controversy', 'backlash', 'gay', 'commmunity***Theatrical', 'trailer']",Cruising VHS

259299,A2USVBMAB7GRKI,6301640659,andy g,"[3, 4]","all you reviewers are right, this film is gutsy, controversal, dark, and lurid. As a gay man i dont find it rude or an insult to homosexuality. there are to this day and age a certain group of gay men who are working class citizens, pay taxes and contribute to society that enjoy this lifestyle depicted in the film. It does exist in big cities to small towns. Then there are gay men who simply choose not to be involved in this lifestyle. Friedkins own film from 1970, THE BOYS IN THE BAND focuses on that group of gay men who are happy, witty, sad, hilarious, and thought provoking. It is these gay men back in 1979 1980 that despised this film back then and to this day. - kudos to AL PACINO for taking on this role. he is a very open minded actor doing gay related work from playing gay in DOG DAY AFTERNOON to the great ANGELS IN AMERICA. Yes CRUISING is unsettling to watch at times but so are alot of other films like NIGHTMARE, a ghastly 80s horror film i just reviewed here on amazon. heck, THE WALKING DEAD is unsettling to watch and thats on cable tv. point here is CRUISING is just a movie like PSYCHO, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and BASIC INSTINCT all with gay lurid undertones that all had there share of controversy in there times of release.

259300,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6301640659,Austin Somlo,"[1, 9]","Viewed: 12/07Rate: 312/07: Cruising is a big disappointment. Even bigger disappointment is Al Pacino. That was absolutely nothing. He basically tip-toed walked through this film. In result, he made Cruising look totally unconvincing. He didn't kiss a guy, let alone have sex with one of them. I think the movie tried to tell me that he did, but come on...that's pretending. As far as the story goes, take away the gay men with leather in the background, the film is so ordinary that it could have been a TV episode itself. The only best part of Cruising is the atmosphere, the background, and the gay club scene. Hadn't it was for Al Pacino, somebody would have stepped in, made it a very believable film, and convince me that it would be truly unique. But Al Pacino never looked the part, didn't blend in quite well, and acted nowhere near what he did in Serpico. If I have to be remiss about anything by Al Pacino, it's Cruising by a mile. He chickened out, plain and simple. The ending had a twist, which was telling me that it was Al Pacino's character the whole time, doing the killings. Honestly, I don't buy it, not even for a slight second. I find it hard to believe if the suspected killer confesses his crimes, he can get eight years for killing five homosexuals. Something in that equation doesn't add up.

259303,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,6301640659,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[25, 25]","Back in 1980, this William Friedkin shocker caused such a controversy that it seemed that everyone condemned it.  The gay community was in an uproar over ""Cruising""'s frank display of male sexuality and what amounted for many to be the generalization of a ""lurid"" gay lifestyle depicted in the film.  The religous community followed with their own  uproar over many of the same issues (albeit for different reasons). The movie was further slammed by critics and audiences alike, who either found the film to be homphobic, dull, nasty, and/or overly sensational. Personally, I think that critics, in particular, were disappointed because they found ""Cruising"" to be a  major step down from William Friedkin's previous hits (""The Exorcist"" and ""The French Connection""). However, after viewing the recently released DVD of the deluxe edition, I have to say that ""Cruising"" is not nearly as bad as it's reputation might suggest.  First of all, as a gay man who was recently out and about in 1980, I don't think that the gay culture of the time is misrepresented here.  Friedkin made the film shortly before the spectre of AIDS descended upon the community, and there was a wide open, hedonistic  sexuality that seemed to be prevalent in every aspect of gay life.  The homosexuality depicted in ""Cruising"" was in context with the reality of the times, regardless of what revisionists may proclaim.  I remember being very disturbed, at the time, by the hypocrisy of gay leaders who wanted to deny the overt sexuality that was a fact of our existence.Second of all, I don't find ""Cruising"" to be a dull film.  While I don't find it to be erotic, or exciting in the tradition of other detective films of the time--there are no car chases ala ""The French Connection""--I do think that it is an effective psychological thriller detailing one man's very dark journey into unknown territory, encompassing both his environment and his very heart and soul.  Al Pacino is surprisingly good as Steve Burns, a plucky, green young cop selected by his superior officer (Paul Sorvino) to go undercover and track down a serial killer of gay men frequenting S&M; clubs, parks, and sex shops.  After his performances in the Godfather films, ""Dog Day Afternoon"", and ""Serpico"", among others, it's interesting to note that Pacino was able to bring the depth of believable naivete to his character; it makes the character's transformation all the more shocking.  Paul Sorvino also delivers a first-rate performance as Pacino's boss, a longtime cop who always seems to be withholding something (information, concern, money).  A pre-""Indiana Jones"" Karen Allen is also on hand as Pacino's girlfriend, although her scene of primary impact is reserved for the final seconds of the film.The quality of the deluxe edition is pristine, with the gorgeously restored cinematography suggesting that the film is of more recent vintage than 1980.  Yet, the clothes, hairstyles, scenes of New York street life--all suggest a New York of another time, not so long ago, yet long gone, in so many ways.I don't have any major problems with ""Cruising"", certainly not the ambiguous ending nor the fact that not all the loose ends are neatly tied up for the viewer.  I actually prefer it that way, and it makes for a more interesting experience that is open to interpretation.  And it's interesting that about half the people on the screen actually look like Pacino and there are scenes where you think that you're watching Pacino, only to discover that it's somebody else. And vice versa. And sometimes you're never 100% certain who you're watching.  I think it's an interesting idea because it forces the viewer to come to his own conclusions, it doesn't offer easy answers. The same goes for the film's suggestion that there may be multiple killers--again, the viewer is forced (like the police at the end of the film) to draw his or her own conclusions. ""Cruising"" is, in may ways, a demanding film with characters that many may find disagreeable or downright unlikeable.  I like ""Cruising"" because it does make you think and because it offers no apologies, no easy way out.",4,Not nearly as bad as its reputation suggests,1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,4131,"['Back', '1980', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'shocker', 'caused', 'controversy', 'seemed', 'everyone', 'condemned', 'gay', 'community', 'was', 'uproar', 'Cruising', 'frank', 'display', 'male', 'sexuality', 'what', 'amounted', 'many', 'be', 'generalization', 'lurid', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'depicted', 'film', 'religous', 'community', 'followed', 'own', 'uproar', 'many', 'same', 'issues', 'different', 'reasons', 'movie', 'was', 'further', 'slammed', 'critics', 'audiences', 'alike', 'who', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'homphobic', 'dull', 'nasty', 'and/or', 'overly', 'sensational', 'Personally', 'think', 'critics', 'particular', 'were', 'disappointed', 'found', 'Cruising', 'be', 'major', 'step', 'down', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'previous', 'hits', 'Exorcist', 'French', 'Connection', 'However', 'viewing', 'recently', 'released', 'DVD', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'have', 'say', 'Cruising', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'reputation', 'might', 'suggest', 'First', 'all', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'recently', '1980', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'gay', 'culture', 'time', 'misrepresented', 'here', 'Friedkin', 'made', 'film', 'shortly', 'spectre', 'AIDS', 'descended', 'community', 'there', 'was', 'wide', 'open', 'hedonistic', 'sexuality', 'seemed', 'be', 'prevalent', 'aspect', 'gay', 'life', 'homosexuality', 'depicted', 'Cruising', 'was', 'context', 'reality', 'times', 'regardless', 'what', 'revisionists', 'may', 'proclaim', 'remember', 'being', 'very', 'disturbed', 'time', 'hypocrisy', 'gay', 'leaders', 'who', 'wanted', 'deny', 'overt', 'sexuality', 'was', 'fact', 'existence.Second', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'Cruising', 'be', 'dull', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'erotic', 'exciting', 'tradition', 'other', 'detective', 'films', 'time', 'are', 'car', 'French', 'Connection', 'do', 'think', 'effective', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'detailing', 'one', 'man', 'very', 'dark', 'journey', 'unknown', 'territory', 'encompassing', 'environment', 'very', 'heart', 'soul', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Steve', 'Burns', 'plucky', 'green', 'young', 'cop', 'selected', 'superior', 'officer', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'go', 'undercover', 'track', 'down', 'serial', 'killer', 'gay', 'men', 'frequenting', 'S', 'M', 'clubs', 'parks', 'sex', 'shops', 'performances', 'Godfather', 'films', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Serpico', 'others', 'interesting', 'note', 'Pacino', 'was', 'able', 'bring', 'depth', 'believable', 'naivete', 'character', 'character', 'transformation', 'more', 'shocking', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'also', 'first-rate', 'performance', 'Pacino', 'boss', 'longtime', 'cop', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'withholding', 'something', 'information', 'concern', 'money', 'pre-', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'also', 'hand', 'Pacino', 'girlfriend', 'scene', 'primary', 'impact', 'reserved', 'final', 'seconds', 'film.The', 'quality', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'pristine', 'gorgeously', 'restored', 'cinematography', 'suggesting', 'film', 'more', 'recent', 'vintage', '1980', 'clothes', 'hairstyles', 'scenes', 'New', 'York', 'street', 'life', 'suggest', 'New', 'York', 'time', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'yet', 'long', 'gone', 'so', 'many', 'ways.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'major', 'problems', 'Cruising', 'certainly', 'not', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'fact', 'not', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'neatly', 'tied', 'up', 'viewer', 'actually', 'prefer', 'way', 'more', 'interesting', 'experience', 'open', 'interpretation', 'interesting', 'people', 'screen', 'actually', 'look', 'Pacino', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'think', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Pacino', 'only', 'discover', 'somebody', 'else', 'vice', 'versa', 'sometimes', ""'re"", 'never', '100', '%', 'certain', 'who', ""'re"", 'watching', 'think', 'interesting', 'idea', 'viewer', 'come', 'own', 'conclusions', ""n't"", 'offer', 'easy', 'answers', 'same', 'film', 'suggestion', 'may', 'be', 'multiple', 'killers', 'again', 'viewer', 'forced', 'police', 'end', 'film', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'Cruising', 'may', 'ways', 'demanding', 'film', 'characters', 'many', 'may', 'find', 'disagreeable', 'downright', 'unlikeable', 'Cruising', 'make', 'think', 'apologies', 'easy', 'way']",Cruising VHS

This marks the long overdue release of this controversial film on DVD, and it is good to see that there shall be plenty of extra features, since I have been arguing with other people about the meaning of this film's ending since its release in 1980. Cruising stars Al Pacino as a cop who infiltrates the homosexual S&M; night life scene in order to solve a murder. Unable to just leave his work at the office in this case, the experience begins to affect his whole life - his outlook, his relationship with his girlfriend, everything. This is one of those love-it-or-hate-it movies. Few people come out on the fence on this one. It is a shocking dark film any way you approach it, but it is also just about the first major motion picture to portray homosexual men as strong masculine types, not just as the effeminite stereotypes that had been characteristic of the role since the birth of motion pictures.

Though not by any means a masterpiece, ""Cruising"" is an intermittently fascinating study of an undercover cop (played by Al Pacino) investigation of a string of brutal murders of local gay men. Filmed in and around several gay bars and hard-core sex clubs located in the heart of New York City's Greenwich Village (with actual patrons--not only extras--and club life serving as the backdrop), the film was quite controversial at the time of its release.  ""Cruising prompted a good number of protests for the graphic, no-holds-barred nature of its subject matter and also for its sensationalism, with the potential to incite or increase violence against gays (this movie was made at the height of the ""gay (sexual) liberation"" movement). ""Cruising"" is best seen for Pacino's stirring performance as the sexually ambivalent Steve Burns, who infiltrates the furtive gay underground scene and finds a powerful, addictive environment that has an intoxicating mixture of danger and gutter glamour.Like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Boys in the Band"" (both of which Friedkin directed), ""Cruising"" is often heavy-handed and it raises far more questions about sexuality, cultural identity and societal permissiveness than it answers. Yet the film still holds one's attention as it telescopes a specific cultural phenomenon circa 1979.

259317,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6301640659,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","Just before the outbreak of AIDS came this lightning rod of a thriller from director/screenwriter William Friedkin (The French Connection,The Exorcist), a grisly murder mystery set deep within Lower Manhattan's gay, S&M; subculture. It comes as no surprise that it has taken so long for this 1980 movie to come to DVD because it is difficult to watch just as much for the weak storytelling as its more unsavory elements.  Based on a 1970 novel by New York Times reporter Gerald Walker, it is heavy on atmosphere, which Friedkin and cinematographer James Contner realistically capture in often graphic detail, but extremely light on character development. This turns out to be the film's ultimate deficiency since it is hard to assess what motivates a lot of the characters' actions beyond the plot circumstances.A serial killer is on the loose in the aptly named meat packing district, and Captain Edelson assigns ambitious young cop Steve Burns to go undercover to find him. Burns pretends to be a gay commercial artist named John Forbes and immediately befriends his neighbor Ted to get to know the area. Soon enough he enters the underground leather bar scene and is simultaneously shocked and intrigued by what he sees and experiences. In hindsight, these scenes still have punch but now have an added layer of emotional complexity with the spread of the AIDS crisis. At the same time, Friedkin spends too much time on this aspect of the story at the expense of the crime drama itself. What happens is that plot points rush by with one innocent suspect brutalized at the police station and then an overlong sequence when the real killer is revealed and methodically pursued. All the while, Burns keeps his girlfriend Nancy in the dark about his undercover work, while he grapples with aspects of his own identity. This is where the story gets the most muddled, and the overly ambiguous ending is the result.In 1980, Al Pacino suffered a temporary career setback playing Burns, but his relatively subtle performance is actually one of the film's redeeming qualities. As Edelson, Paul Sorvino is a somber presence, while Richard Cox does what he can playing a man driven by his father's disapproval. Karen Allen, just before hitting it big inRaiders of the Lost Ark, has little to do but look understandably confused as Nancy. Friedkin provides a detailed and fairly interesting commentary track on the 2007 DVD.

I was 13 when this came out.  I remember it was the talk of the town for a few weeks before disappearing from theaters. Some of the scenes are so vile and make one's stomach turn. In 1980 homosexuality was not quite as accepted as it it today, and it was pretty much okay to call yourself a ""homophobe.""  This movie played on those fears that people had- and some still have. While it's undeniable that this type of underworld existed- and I'm sure still exists- I think the movie implied that this is how most gay men probably live.I do agree with an earlier reviewer who said that the movie gets more interesting after watching it several times.

259319,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6301640659,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[43, 73]","Gay characters began to reach the American screen in the 1960s, but they would not be portrayed with any validity until the 1980s.  Curiously, one of the most homophobic films created by Hollywood would mark the transition: the 1980 William Friedkin CRUISING starring Al Pacino, Paul Sorvino, and Karen Allen.Based on the novel of the same name, CRUISING might best be described as a sexual thriller.  Police officer Steve Burns (Al Pacino) is sent undercover into the gay community to attract and identify a serial killer who stalks New York City S&M; bars, slashing and sometimes dismembering his victims with a serrated knife.  But even as the killer strikes again and again, Burns becomes more and more entangled in this extremely dark world, comes to identify with the killer, and eventually self-destructs in a particularly nightmarish way.From an artistic standpoint, CRUISING has several things going for it.  Director Friedkin has an interesting eye, and the film has an unexpectedly gritty, at times almost documentary-like style.  It also has tremendous atmosphere; it is adept at making the viewer feel unsettled.  The cast is also effective in heightening the disturbing tone of the film as a whole.  What the film does not have is a coherent plot, nor does it have anything approaching a decent script, and it is grotesquely insulting to the gay community in several ways.CRUISING equates homosexuality with an extreme sexual lifestyle, and what emerges is a portrait of ""nasty men doing nasty things in nasty bars.""  Does such a subculture exist in the gay community?  Of course it does, just as it does in the heterosexual community--but CRUISING posits this as the norm for homosexuals.  Even more distastefully, what ultimately emerges is the idea that a heterosexual man can be seduced into the gay community in which (at least according to the film) extreme sex, insanity, and violent death all go hand in hand.  And it was precisely this that so outraged many in the gay community when the film was made.  Film shoots were repeatedly disrupted by protests, and director Friedkin tried to calm the matter by stating that CRUISING was not ""about"" homosexuals--an extremely bizarre statement that only fueled community ire.A number of gay organizations greeted the film with boycotts, but as it happened their efforts were unnecessary.  Few critics and even fewer moviegoers liked the film and it soon faded from view.  Seen today it reads very much like a snapshot of American homophobia in 1980 and little more.  But CRUISING does have a certain historical significance: by and large it would be the last major Hollywood film to present the entire gay community in a wholly negative light.The very outrageousness of the film seemed to prompt American film makers to a much needed reevaluation of the way in which gay characters were portrayed on screen.  Although ""gay man equals bad man"" characters have cropped up in a few films since--Kevin Costner's NO WAY OUT and several of Mel Gibson's films come to mind--the overall reaction to CRUISING killed the stereotype.  And so the film, in an accidental sort of way, is significant from a historical standpoint; film historians and movie buffs will find it interesting, and I give it three stars for their sake.  But just about everyone else should leave it alone.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Distasteful But Historically Significant,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,3354,"['Gay', 'characters', 'began', 'reach', 'American', 'screen', '1960s', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'portrayed', 'validity', '1980s', 'Curiously', 'one', 'most', 'homophobic', 'films', 'created', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'mark', 'transition', '1980', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'CRUISING', 'starring', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'Karen', 'Allen.Based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'CRUISING', 'might', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'sexual', 'thriller', 'Police', 'officer', 'Steve', 'Burns', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'sent', 'undercover', 'gay', 'community', 'attract', 'identify', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'S', 'M', 'bars', 'slashing', 'sometimes', 'dismembering', 'victims', 'serrated', 'knife', 'even', 'killer', 'strikes', 'again', 'again', 'Burns', 'more', 'more', 'entangled', 'extremely', 'dark', 'world', 'identify', 'killer', 'eventually', 'self-destructs', 'particularly', 'nightmarish', 'artistic', 'standpoint', 'CRUISING', 'several', 'things', 'going', 'Director', 'Friedkin', 'interesting', 'eye', 'film', 'unexpectedly', 'gritty', 'times', 'almost', 'documentary-like', 'style', 'also', 'tremendous', 'atmosphere', 'adept', 'making', 'viewer', 'feel', 'unsettled', 'cast', 'also', 'effective', 'heightening', 'disturbing', 'tone', 'film', 'whole', 'What', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'coherent', 'plot', 'have', 'anything', 'approaching', 'decent', 'script', 'grotesquely', 'insulting', 'gay', 'community', 'several', 'ways.CRUISING', 'equates', 'homosexuality', 'extreme', 'sexual', 'lifestyle', 'what', 'portrait', 'nasty', 'men', 'doing', 'nasty', 'things', 'nasty', 'bars', 'subculture', 'exist', 'gay', 'community', 'course', 'just', 'heterosexual', 'community', 'CRUISING', 'norm', 'homosexuals', 'Even', 'more', 'distastefully', 'what', 'ultimately', 'idea', 'heterosexual', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'seduced', 'gay', 'community', 'least', 'according', 'film', 'extreme', 'sex', 'insanity', 'violent', 'death', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'was', 'precisely', 'so', 'outraged', 'many', 'gay', 'community', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Film', 'shoots', 'were', 'repeatedly', 'disrupted', 'protests', 'director', 'Friedkin', 'tried', 'calm', 'matter', 'stating', 'CRUISING', 'was', 'not', 'homosexuals', 'extremely', 'bizarre', 'statement', 'only', 'fueled', 'community', 'ire.A', 'number', 'gay', 'organizations', 'greeted', 'film', 'boycotts', 'happened', 'efforts', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'Few', 'critics', 'even', 'fewer', 'moviegoers', 'liked', 'film', 'soon', 'faded', 'view', 'Seen', 'today', 'very', 'much', 'snapshot', 'American', 'homophobia', '1980', 'little', 'more', 'CRUISING', 'have', 'certain', 'historical', 'significance', 'large', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'present', 'entire', 'gay', 'community', 'wholly', 'negative', 'light.The', 'very', 'outrageousness', 'film', 'seemed', 'prompt', 'American', 'film', 'makers', 'much', 'needed', 'reevaluation', 'way', 'gay', 'characters', 'were', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'gay', 'man', 'equals', 'bad', 'man', 'characters', 'have', 'cropped', 'up', 'few', 'films', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'NO', 'WAY', 'OUT', 'several', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'films', 'come', 'mind', 'overall', 'reaction', 'CRUISING', 'killed', 'stereotype', 'so', 'film', 'accidental', 'sort', 'way', 'significant', 'historical', 'standpoint', 'film', 'historians', 'movie', 'buffs', 'will', 'find', 'interesting', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'sake', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'should', 'leave', 'alone.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Cruising VHS

Mitchell ""greggmitch""","[13, 17]","I snuck into the theater when I was 13 years old to see this and was disturbed to say the least - as a young gay teen, Friedkin's own brand of ""horrorshow"" made me (wrongly) assume that all gay men were leather-clad, freaky serial killers! Still, when you look at the f*d-up film now, you see many of the same techniques the director used for his earlier hits like ""Exorcist,"" most notably shock tactics and in-your-face blunt sexually violent imagery to get a reaction out of conservative critics and audiences alike. In fact, in retrospect, I'd say all the negative press coverage and gay rights protests that met ""Cruising"" upon its initial 1982 theatrical release were a bit overkill - sure this movie decidedly portrays (some) gays in a negative, one-note light, but this isn't a documentary (even if it feels like one), but a fictional murder-mystery thriller with a gay angle as thematic hook.  Oddly, I actually wish Friedkin would have gone further - funny, he doesn't shy away from showing seedy, explicit, severely cruel gay murders (*the scene where the killer knifes the cute Columbia professor in the back saying ""You made me do that!"" ranks as one of the most disturbing death scenes ever!), Friedkin doesn't have the BALLS to show male-on-male affection - this explains why Pacino in the lead role seems so UNCOMFORTABLE at doing his P.I. work - he's willing to go underground, but he's NOT willing to GO DOWN!  And what are we to make of the notoriously ""ambivalent"" final shot - to me, it feels more like a COP-OUT than a genuine mystery - is Pacino's cop gay? the killer? in denial? Is it all a dream? Who knows - the film itself looks like it was SEVERELY EDITED prior to release - so here's hoping when and IF it ever re-surfaces on DVD we will be treated to DELETED SCENES which censors cut out that might finally explain it all?  Or at least an indepth documentary illuminating the process behind the camera?  As it is, CRUISING remains a flawed, but undeniable ground-breaking, ahead-of-its-time movie - do you think a major studio movie covering gay sexuality would ever be THIS unflinching in its depicting or honesty of some segements of extreme gay sex culture? Hell NO! At times, it looks like a bleak, sad glimpse at another world - and it was to my eyes: a decadent 70s idyll in NYC that we've all heard about, but now post-AIDS seems like centuries ago, the Roman era if you will.  At least we have this sordid little flick as a kind of document of that long lost Mappelthorpe-esque era.  **FINAL NOTE: During the graphic gay murder scenes, if you look VERY close, you can tell that Friedkin has INSERTED SUBLIMINAL XXX GAY PORNO SCENES in the midst of the violence, equating gay intercourse with the act of murder?  Aside from the fact I am AMAZED this got past the censors in the 80s, this kind of directorial decision is very very upsetting to say the least - what is Friedkin trying to say in these sequences - or just get us all collectively off with homophobic violence?

As a time capsule, it's fascinating.  It was shot in NYC in 1980 when the city was dying all around, and many of these gay ""meat markets"" were in full swing.  The gay bar scenes are incredibly intense and realistic, and they can still shock most viewers today.  The film has a real dirge, detached atmosphere to it, giving it an unexplainable vibe.  The dialogue is flatly rendered, and at first I disliked this.  This may have been due to gay groups very loud protests during the actual shooting.  While they were location shooting in NYC, various gay groups disturbed the filming by shouting, whistling, blowing off sirens, etc., etc., in other words, they made sound recording almost impossible.  On the featurette (which is fascinating), the producer and Friedkin said they took a month and a half to do ADR (automatic dialogue replacement) on the film.  I believe gay groups were angry that the ""leather scene"" was the only type of gay subculture portrayed in the film, and I understand their concerns, but that was no reason to attempt and stop the film being made, which is essentially what they did.The film's plot isn't particularly well developed, and Pacino's character is mostly confused (as is his performance, which supposedly he was unhappy with).  Friedkin made one of the greatest gay films ever with The Boys in the Band, but here his film feels exploitative, like he enjoyed showing the bondage/leather gay scene of NYC instead of showing relatively straightforward gay people.  The film feels unfinished, but not by design.  The only deliberate ambiguity I feel is the ending.  SPOILER.  The killer is caught, but a murder happens after the killer is caught which is indirectly connected to the case, and that really leaves a creepy vibe when the film ends.Look quickly for James Remar and Ed O'Neil as a gay roomate and a detective, respectively.

259326,A9I40WFF40R4,6301640659,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[2, 5]","I saw this movie in the theatres when it was released in 1980 and defended Mr. Friedkin's (""The Exorcist"" and ""Boys In The Band"") right to make it when my friends protested its opening. I was curious to see what ""Cruising"" looks like over twenty-five years later. It does not wear well with time. Taken from a book by the same name, it's all about a homosexual serial killer who is making a bloody path through New York City's leather community. Al Pacino as Steven Burns of NYPD complete with a full set of leather goes undercover to catch the killer. The plot is still hard to follow and often doesn't make much sense; Pacino, who is such a fine actor, doesn't get his act together here, probably through no fault of his. (He allegedly said that this is the worst movie he ever made.) Much of the film is shot in a leather bar in New York City to give-- I supose-- realism to the story.The DVD contains a long and winding defense of this film by the director William Friedkin. He should have left well enough alone. He tries unsuccessfully to convince us that ""Cruising"" is in no way homophobic. If he is not attempting the sensational, then why does he use what he calls more edgy music than the music that was playing in the bars when he made this film since he only wants to give an accurate depiction of the gay leather community? Do members of that community have women's names and constantly refer to each other with feminine pronouns? Are we really to believe that a muscle-bound member of the NYPD force wearing only a cap, boots and a jock strap roughs up a suspect at the precinct station? Mr. Friedkin says a similar event actually occurred but offers no proof of that. The ending is laughable. All of Pacino's soulful staring into the mirror will not make a great, serious film out of a homophobic slasher. In addition to all the footage of Friedkin, the minor characters give interviews although we do not get one word from or glimpse of Mr. Pacino. Jerry Weintraub, the producer, says that the novel from which the film is made is an ""important piece of literature."" I kid you not.If Mr. Friedkin had depicted the African America or Jewish community-- or any other minority for that matter-- in such a way, he would have been vilified to the heavens. While you certainly do not have to be homosexual to make a movie about gay people that portrays them as complex, flesh-and-blood individuals-- Mike Nichols, for example, does a wonderful job in ""Birdcage"" of making a funny but honest movie-- it would be interesting to see what a gay director would have done with this story. Probably nothing.I rant on. The good news is that I didn't pay a lot for the rental of the movie and that it will have the fate of most dull movies and become a bit of the history of gay cinema since it's not quite bad enough to make cult status, at least not for me.",3,Both Homophobic and Mediocre,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,2860,"['saw', 'movie', 'theatres', 'when', 'was', 'released', '1980', 'defended', 'Mr.', 'Friedkin', 'Exorcist', 'Boys', 'Band', 'right', 'make', 'when', 'friends', 'protested', 'opening', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'Cruising', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'later', 'not', 'wear', 'well', 'time', 'Taken', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'homosexual', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'making', 'bloody', 'path', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'leather', 'community', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Steven', 'Burns', 'NYPD', 'complete', 'full', 'set', 'leather', 'undercover', 'catch', 'killer', 'plot', 'still', 'hard', 'follow', 'often', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'Pacino', 'who', 'fine', 'actor', ""n't"", 'get', 'act', 'together', 'here', 'probably', 'fault', 'allegedly', 'said', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Much', 'film', 'shot', 'leather', 'bar', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'give', 'supose', 'realism', 'story.The', 'DVD', 'long', 'winding', 'defense', 'film', 'director', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'unsuccessfully', 'convince', 'Cruising', 'way', 'homophobic', 'not', 'attempting', 'sensational', 'then', 'why', 'use', 'what', 'more', 'edgy', 'music', 'music', 'was', 'playing', 'bars', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'only', 'give', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'gay', 'leather', 'community', 'Do', 'members', 'community', 'have', 'women', 'names', 'constantly', 'refer', 'other', 'feminine', 'pronouns', 'Are', 'really', 'believe', 'muscle-bound', 'member', 'NYPD', 'force', 'wearing', 'only', 'cap', 'boots', 'jock', 'strap', 'up', 'suspect', 'precinct', 'station', 'Mr.', 'Friedkin', 'similar', 'event', 'actually', 'occurred', 'proof', 'ending', 'laughable', 'Pacino', 'soulful', 'staring', 'mirror', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'great', 'serious', 'film', 'homophobic', 'slasher', 'addition', 'footage', 'Friedkin', 'minor', 'characters', 'give', 'interviews', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'one', 'word', 'glimpse', 'Mr.', 'Pacino', 'Jerry', 'Weintraub', 'producer', 'novel', 'film', 'made', 'important', 'piece', 'literature', 'kid', 'not.If', 'Mr.', 'Friedkin', 'had', 'depicted', 'African', 'America', 'Jewish', 'community', 'other', 'minority', 'matter', 'such', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'vilified', 'heavens', 'certainly', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'homosexual', 'make', 'movie', 'gay', 'people', 'complex', 'flesh-and-blood', 'individuals', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'example', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Birdcage', 'making', 'funny', 'honest', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'gay', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'story', 'Probably', 'nothing.I', 'rant', 'good', 'news', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'lot', 'rental', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'fate', 'most', 'dull', 'movies', 'become', 'bit', 'history', 'gay', 'cinema', 'not', 'quite', 'bad', 'enough', 'make', 'cult', 'status', 'least', 'not']",Cruising VHS

The shocking or disturbing murder scenes, with the exception of the first, are dull and lackluster. There was nothing disturbing about them. Bigger drawbacks were the overall gay scenes were not convincing enough. So much looked staged and rehearsed, specifically the cruising scenes in the woods or city.

259329,A18OUQEK7IZ2F2,6301640659,"Jason Kirkfield ""The Pride and Sorrow of chil...","[6, 10]","While I disagree with the Turkey (1-star) rating given byMick Martin--at nine words, it was also one of the shortest reviews in the guide: ""A horror in the real sense of the word.""--William Friedkin's 1980 film is very far from perfect.I have seen Cruising three times, each viewing separated by several months. The film is disturbing every time. It's not just the unbelievable level of risk (and nonexistent backup) that the undercover assignment affords. It's also the unease with which Friedkin retells thestory. This seems to be a case of not knowing how offensive to be. Protesters from New York City's gay community besieged the on-location production, and Friedkin admits during the commentary track that post-production looping was necessary due to the noise. Richard Gere (And the Band Played On) was said to have been Friedkin's first choice for the lead, and maybe the first instinct was right. Al Pacino (looking eerily like a young John Turturro) seems willing to get his hands dirty--some of the club scenes, which may or may not include stolen footage, evidence fisting--but he remains hamstrung by the script. Ultimately, the filmmakers got it wrong: the film is too disturbing for the general public and yet not disturbing enough for enthusiasts of the genre.More objectively, the film is simply not shot well. Or maybe the editing is to blame. A late scene of Pacino stalking his suspect goes dark except for a spotlight around Pacino. Apparently this is a ""Director's Cut"" tweak to make the scene's intent more clear. The same suspect's father, seen in flashback sequences, is a confusing and unsatisfying red herring. Moreover, the director's decision to interchange actors as the killer in an attempt to deliberately confuse the whodunit seems misguided. Cruising's ambiguity leaves this viewer unclear whether that was the goal or whether Friedkin simply could not decide what story to tell (or how to tell it). Too, the film suffers from an inability to connect emotionally with its hero.The Village Voice's Nathan Lee opined recently that Cruising is ""a lurid fever dream of popper fumes, color-coded pocket hankies, hardcore disco frottage, and Crisco-coated forearms."" Certainly it remains a time capsule despite its many faults. Clubs like the Ramrod are long since gone and sadly so must be many of the men who played extras here. Unfortunately, this exploitative film does nothing to dispel the posited association between homosexuality and antisocial behavior. Witness Friedkin's decision to intersplice frames of hardcore gay pornography into some of the murder scenes.Somewhat infamously, the film and its director were nominated for the first ever RAZZIE Awards. Poor commentary track here in the Deluxe Edition: Director Friedkin alternates between simply describing the action and dead air. It is much less informative and engaging than his insight onThe French Connection. Better is the long interview with Friedkin from the September 2007 issue of Venice Magazine.

So when Cruising came out when I was 13, I talked my parents into taking me, without any knowledge what the film was about(the TV spots were obscure, as you can imagine). About half way through the film my parents took me home, much to my relief. However, they thought there was something ""wrong"" with me for wanting to see the film in the first place. I tried to explain that I had no idea the film's subject matter, which was the truth. Ironically, when I came out four years later I think they actually blamed the film. Haha!So a few years later when I was old enough to rent the film on my own, I watched it all the way through. I'm a big Exorcist fan and Pacino fan, so I thought this film would be a grand slam, but it was endlessly strange to the point of confusing, and despite some intriguing visual shocks, it was basically flat and boring. Although the film does portray homosexuals as eithef effeminate or hyper masculine leathermen, I don't find it ""homophobic"" anymore than I find Animal House heterophobic (Animal House doesn't exactly show the heterosexual community in the best light either). Anyone who sees this film and assumes that's how gay people act aren't worth much effort convincing anyway. The acting is below par, the script nonsensicle, the direction choppy. About the only redeeming quality of the film is the cinematography. I would reccommend this film only if you are curious how wacked out a filmaker can get.

I don't think it was trying to portray them accurately and I don't think it was trying to market itself to the ""gay crowd"" like Will&Grace does.  I think it was simply an idea that was well executed (considering how fantastical the plot is, really, it makes sense that gay people wouldn't be realistically portrayed, just like Moms aren't realistically portrayed on television, 'CAUSE IT'S FANTASY!!!. anyway).  I liked it, but it's really kinda naggin' me that people think it's ""homophobic"".

259336,A2VP5OOKKLLCPV,6301640659,"Julie Vognar ""Julie""","[4, 8]","The VHS tape I rented of this film was excellent; I bought the DVD not so much for a better print, as to hear Friedkin's voiceover of the film. There are confusing things in it, I thought; perhaps Friedkin will explajn them. Although it is very intersting to hear almost all of what Friedkin says (and he analyses almost every scene in detail), a summary might be: an intelligent viewer will agreee with Socretes that a wise man knows he knows nothing! Things I thought I understood were not meant to be understood, but to raise more questions.This doesn't mzke the film, or the commentary,  any less fascinating. It's also interesting to know that the film was lagely made as a real slice of life in that the leather bars, the hotel, and the minor actors (not acting)--were all real, and filmed on location, in 1979.The opposition to the making of the film, expressed in demonstrations by sections of the gay community in New York, are understandable (""Don't we have ENOUGH troubles?""), but objectively speaking, for anyone to take this film as representing the whole of gay life, at any time, would be the equivelent of watching an episode of ""The Sopranos,"" and concluding that all Italian-Americans made huge amounts of money dealing mostly illegally in mostly illegal goods, and that none of them had any understanding of the value of human life.The following poem came about with the realization that ""Master and Commander"" and ""Cruising"" end with exactly the same part of the same Boccherini quartet, and my initial consternation that I was not going to be told any more about the plot of the film than I already knew. In fact--less!There is one added line of dialogue, and some minor, but nifty special effects.Boccherini QuartetTwo men, a captain and his first mate,Sit in the captain's cabin, and play Boccherini,The captain with his viola, the mate with an instrumentI would call a cello--were it not so long ago. It isThe most tuneful part of the quartet, ending in aFeathery lightness, as the scene dissolves to their four-masted shipBecoming little more than a spot on the great ocean.A pretty girl puts a phonograph record on--why,The captain and the first mate are still playing, after all!They have begun their tune again.As she tries on a killer's hat, and her boyfriend's leather jacket,He is shaving in the bathroom mirror, and catches his own eyes there.Those great, dark eyes, thoughtful at first, and then, questioning: who am I now?  Their question overrides their sophistication, and the scene moves toThe Hudson River, outside the window, as a dirty yellow tugboatPasses in front of the setting sun, to the feathery lightnessOf the music.ADDENDA: yes, well, that's all very well. But Friedkin's screenplay acknowledges being based on a 1970 novel by Gerald Walker, which is a horror beyond your imagining--according to Russo (who occasionally makes mistakes). According to Vito Russo (""The Celluloid Closet""--the BOOK), because of the ambiguity of the film, it is possible to interpret the film this way: In Walker's book, a policeman goes undercover to trap a killer of homosexual men, and in the process, discovers his own homosexuality--and starts killing gays himself. According to Russo, homosexuality in the book is spread like being a vampire (one bite does the trick), and the book is not about ""Cruising"" being violent (which in itself is bad enough as a theory), but about homosexuality itself being violent.  For homophobes, ordinary, and gay people with this book in the back of their minds, THIS WILL NOT DO, obviously. Friedkin has changed the focus of his film--to soft. Pacino's character's sexuality may change (reveal itself as other than he thought it to be), and it may not. The ""serial killer"" turns out to be several killers (the killers are played by different actors)--WHY?, Pacino may have killed his friend (the last murder in the film)--though God knows why.Friedkin perhaps should have hung his script on a less horrifying book. However much he has changed, or softened it, it remains confusing--and open to the interpretation that Walker gave his novel. I like confusion, but being told that my lifestyle, or sexual proclivities, leads to self-hatred and hatred of him ""who made me that way""--doesn't sit well at all.More addenda:A: My mother made me a homosexual!B: Oh!

Right from that great line, ""Have you ever been porked?"" between stars Paul Sorvino and a fresh-faced Al Pacino, this film draws me in like few others.While the police action and the chase mystery are interesting, what I enjoy most about this film is Pacino's transformation from all-American boy cop to undercover cop to feigning homosexuality in the leather underground of New York and the changes he goes through to get there. The script suggests he and girlfriend Karen Allen lose their love life in the process; how could they not? Try chaning your sexual orientation sometime for the focus of your job.The scene between investigative chieftain Sorvino and his boss, who makes it clear to Paul that he either catches the killer by the time of the upcoming 1980 political convention or ""I'll put someone in your seat who can do just that"" adds an element or reality to the film, which straddles the line between fantasy and reality much of the time.After being given the ultimatum, Sorvino turns up the heat on his undercover cop turning gay man, Pacino. In a touching and dramatic scene, Sorvino not only turns down Pacino's request to be released from the case, he hands him potential new leads and in effect says, ""Catch this guy.""So, for me, this film is full of human realities and conflicts that make it a great film. This transcends the somewhat mundane material -- the norish police drama focused on catching a serial killer in the gay leather underground -- that makes it a compelling film about people and situations and how the two come together in art.One thing I've never understood -- the ending. All seems well afterward, but is it? Does the tug in the harbor signal some rumbling beneath the surface? Or does this signal a return to normalcy for everyone. This is the kind of emotion Friedkin generated in all his films. Since no sequel was produced, I may go to my grave wondering about this.

The theme is murder.Al Pacino is cast as an undercover cop out to get the  bad guy who is murdering homosexual men who participate in this bondage and dominance world.  This is a world and a lifestyle that flourished before AIDs, and many of the scenes were filmed in the actual clubs such as the Ramrod, the Anvil, the Mine Shaft and the Eagle's Nest that catered to the tastes of this subculture at the time.  It was filmed in New York's Greenwich Village and the infamous meat packing district and waterfront which has since been converted into a beautiful waterside park and upscale apartment living areas.  But then was then and this is now.The film is raw with tension throughout as the serial killer brutally murders his victims.  When Al Pacino comes into the picture we experience it all through his eyes.  He's actually straight and we see him in various scenes with his girlfriend, played by Karen Allen.  Naturally he can't tell her about his assignment which creates tension between them.  But there is tension throughout the film in other ways too.  Men are attracted to Pacino and he must play his part of being gay.  The murderer keeps killing victims.  Paul Sorvino, cast as the detective who encourages Pacino to keep going is understanding.  But he pushes Pacino hard.  There's pressure to solve the crimes.  And there's conflict in Pacino's mind about this lifestyle.How it all turns out is predictable but not before there are many false leads and a depiction of how the cops intimidate and abuse possible perpetrators.This is a good film and Pacino once again proves his acting ability.

Unfortunately, Friedkin winds  up talking to himself.  It was obvious he was hinting that Pacino himself  was struggling with latent desires, but I didn't care when it was all said  and done.  It's apparent that Friedkin was more hyped on creating a  mixed-bag soundtrack of early 80s New York punk entries and ECM snatches by  Barre Phillips and Ralph Towner, none of which fit very well into this  choppy exercise.  There's no moral excuse for the vivid depiction and  sadistic sexualization of the film's first brutal stabbing; it's the most  reprehensible and artistically irresponsible thing I've ever seen this side  of a snuff movie.  One can smell Friedkin getting a rise from setting up  and lighting this 'fascist-erotica scene which equates penetration with  repeated knife-weilding (not a breakthough thought) The whole thing left me  feeling sad and sleazy, and the only other two films that have had that  effect on me where the risible, pornographic 52 PICKUP, and the gutter-born  I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE.

259346,A363QRXP83K8ZE,6301640659,"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[10, 16]","Simply stated, Cruising looks like a serious career-killer for any filmmaker or actor. Try to imagine a major American director pulling this off today. Might be possible, but for William Friedkin this was an atomic bomb.Interesting and very telling - not long after the release of this film Friedkin had a heart attack and began to re-examine his life and career. He became less intense.This is a film that just had me asking, ""What was he thinking?"" It's not even that it's bad--there are far, far worse films that are less watchable. Friedkin is a great technical director. Even when his films don't work they're still compelling to watch. There's a documentary style that he employs in his work (stemming from his early career in TV and docu-drama) as well as excellent locations and art direction. It's just that Cruising is...very strange indeed.  After reading quite a bit about the film and the pains it took to produce, it's apparent that Friedkin was DETERMINED to make it, no matter what. It was definitely the work of an angry, self-destructive man who had to get his way, no matter what the cost. I believe Friedkin knew this film would bomb and boy, did it. He knew the movie would hurt him and his credibility, but he fought on, attacked by the Village Voice, picketed on location, and blasted in the press by critics.Cruising is more valuable as a career statement on Friedkin than as the cop-murder-drama it purports to be. Al Pacino, sporting a jaw-droppingly bad perm(!) goes undercover in NYC's West Village to hunt a killer who preys on leather-bar patrons. The film delves into the world of gay leather S&M;, and it drew such hatred from gay communities that a disclaimer was added at the beginning. It states that the portrayal of the gay crowd in the film is not typical of the entire gay community blah blah blah, but make no mistake, I think Friedkin was out to shock peolpe. I think Friedkin wanted to be the bad guy and bring the house down around him.A working director who struck gold with The French Connection, Friedkin followed up that classic with The Exorcist, still considered the top horror film. After that he had free reign...and so he chose to make an incredibly difficult film in Sorcerer. A great remake of the French classic The Wages of Fear, that film was grittier and visually amazing. It didn't grab audiences. Friedkin made The Brinks Job next as a kind of makeup, but then he chose Cruising. And Friedkin has never really recovered.To be honest, this film has a gritty look. There are some creepy moments. There is atmosphere. Apparently the original print had an amazingly intricate sound mix, constructed partially by Friedkin himself, but unfortunately this is not present on the VHS version. Pacino looks like he's somewhere else in this film. Still to this day he doesn't talk about Cruising in interviews. Friedkin admit that he's wrong for the part. Otherwise we get dependable, somber support from Paul Sorvino while Karen Allen has little to do as Pacino's girlfriend.This is a whodunit where we never know who dun it! The movie is so ambiguous about the murderer that the resolution is irrelevant in the face of the overwhelmingly seedy atmosphere. Are there 2 killers? Or is there only 1? Is Al Pacino gay? Is he a killer? Is the killer gay? Why is there a cop wearing a cowboy hat and only a jockstrap in the police station, slapping witnesses? What on earth is going on?Plain and simple, William Friedkin lost his mind for a while when he made this. I think he's much better now. Pacino managed to recover from the perm, but this is some kind of dark period for him.Recommended for die-hard Friedkin fans, otherwise most will want to avoid.  Even die-hard Pacino fans may not want to see Michael Corleone learning the meaning of different colored hankerchiefs in one's back pocket...",2,An atomic career bomb for Friedkin,1031443200,"09 8, 2002",2002,3844,"['Simply', 'stated', 'Cruising', 'looks', 'serious', 'career-killer', 'filmmaker', 'actor', 'Try', 'imagine', 'major', 'American', 'director', 'pulling', 'off', 'today', 'Might', 'be', 'possible', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'was', 'atomic', 'bomb.Interesting', 'very', 'telling', 'not', 'long', 'release', 'film', 'Friedkin', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'began', 're-examine', 'life', 'career', 'became', 'less', 'intense.This', 'film', 'just', 'had', 'asking', 'What', 'was', 'thinking', 'not', 'even', 'bad', 'are', 'far', 'far', 'worse', 'films', 'are', 'less', 'watchable', 'Friedkin', 'great', 'technical', 'director', 'Even', 'when', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', ""'re"", 'still', 'compelling', 'watch', 'documentary', 'style', 'work', 'stemming', 'early', 'career', 'TV', 'docu-drama', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'locations', 'art', 'direction', 'just', 'Cruising', 'very', 'strange', 'indeed', 'reading', 'quite', 'bit', 'film', 'pains', 'took', 'produce', 'apparent', 'Friedkin', 'was', 'DETERMINED', 'make', 'matter', 'what', 'was', 'definitely', 'work', 'angry', 'self-destructive', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'get', 'way', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'believe', 'Friedkin', 'knew', 'film', 'would', 'bomb', 'boy', 'did', 'knew', 'movie', 'would', 'hurt', 'credibility', 'fought', 'attacked', 'Village', 'Voice', 'picketed', 'location', 'blasted', 'press', 'critics.Cruising', 'more', 'valuable', 'career', 'statement', 'Friedkin', 'cop-murder-drama', 'be', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'sporting', 'jaw-droppingly', 'bad', 'perm', 'undercover', 'NYC', 'West', 'Village', 'hunt', 'killer', 'who', 'leather-bar', 'patrons', 'film', 'world', 'gay', 'leather', 'S', 'M', 'drew', 'such', 'hatred', 'gay', 'communities', 'disclaimer', 'was', 'added', 'beginning', 'portrayal', 'gay', 'crowd', 'film', 'not', 'typical', 'entire', 'gay', 'community', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'make', 'mistake', 'think', 'Friedkin', 'was', 'out', 'shock', 'peolpe', 'think', 'Friedkin', 'wanted', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'bring', 'house', 'down', 'around', 'him.A', 'working', 'director', 'who', 'struck', 'gold', 'French', 'Connection', 'Friedkin', 'followed', 'up', 'classic', 'Exorcist', 'still', 'considered', 'top', 'horror', 'film', 'had', 'free', 'reign', 'so', 'chose', 'make', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'film', 'Sorcerer', 'A', 'great', 'remake', 'French', 'classic', 'Wages', 'Fear', 'film', 'was', 'grittier', 'visually', 'amazing', 'did', ""n't"", 'grab', 'audiences', 'Friedkin', 'made', 'Brinks', 'Job', 'next', 'kind', 'makeup', 'then', 'chose', 'Cruising', 'Friedkin', 'never', 'really', 'recovered.To', 'be', 'honest', 'film', 'gritty', 'look', 'are', 'creepy', 'moments', 'atmosphere', 'Apparently', 'original', 'print', 'had', 'amazingly', 'intricate', 'sound', 'mix', 'constructed', 'partially', 'Friedkin', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'present', 'VHS', 'version', 'Pacino', 'somewhere', 'else', 'film', 'Still', 'day', ""n't"", 'talk', 'Cruising', 'interviews', 'Friedkin', 'admit', 'wrong', 'part', 'Otherwise', 'get', 'dependable', 'somber', 'support', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'little', 'do', 'Pacino', 'girlfriend.This', 'whodunit', 'where', 'never', 'know', 'who', 'dun', 'movie', 'so', 'ambiguous', 'murderer', 'resolution', 'irrelevant', 'face', 'overwhelmingly', 'seedy', 'atmosphere', 'Are', 'there', '2', 'killers', 'only', '1', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'gay', 'killer', 'killer', 'gay', 'Why', 'there', 'cop', 'wearing', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'only', 'jockstrap', 'police', 'station', 'slapping', 'witnesses', 'What', 'earth', 'going', 'Plain', 'simple', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'lost', 'mind', 'while', 'when', 'made', 'think', 'much', 'better', 'now', 'Pacino', 'managed', 'recover', 'perm', 'kind', 'dark', 'period', 'him.Recommended', 'die-hard', 'Friedkin', 'fans', 'otherwise', 'most', 'will', 'want', 'avoid', 'Even', 'die-hard', 'Pacino', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'learning', 'meaning', 'different', 'colored', 'hankerchiefs', 'one', 'back', 'pocket']",Cruising VHS

259348,A3N0BMJ1YTJJZ8,6301640659,Oliver Pennington,"[0, 5]","After CRUISING came out, I saw the author of the original book interviewed on a NY television news show. He was as confused as most of the audience who saw the film.  ""It doesn't make any sense,"" he said. ""They cut out the principle parts of my book and bowed to pressure.  It's a mess.""I went to see CRUISING at a huge theatre on Broadway and saw it with a packed house. Some guys I personally knew were in the film (I was supposed to audition but had to leave town because Mommy was ill).  I didn't dislike the movie, per se, I just don't like to be blind-folded and led down a dark ""cul de sac.""  This movie was mostly a tease: is Al Pacino getting turned on by all the sex he's witnessing, or, is he just amazed that good-looking gay men, most of whom are as masculine as straight guys, are actually doing these things?  The Central Park, Village and other cruising activity was very realistic and ominous.Pacino was in a rather dull, ""let's-eat-and-watch-television"" type of relationship and was suddenly thrusted into the dark underworld of leather bars and anonymous sex.  It was obvious that the Pacino character was ""interested"" in the raunchy goings on at the underground haunts.  He really got caught up in the scene filmed at The Bar in the East Village where he unwittingly sees the killer for the first time.  Al gets swept up in some frenzied dancing and popper sniffing during this scene and actually looked like ""one of the muscled boys.""On Uniform Night at dark dive, he witnesses some heavy sex activity which included a sling and a can of Crisco.  Freidkin fought like made to keep Al straight, but curious, and I think that he really did have catching the murderer as his #1 priority.  But there were holes in the script.  The main one came when Al felt he had found the killer and where he lived.  He breaks into the guy's apartment, snoops around, but doesn't take anything that might have the guy's fingerprints!  The police have the killer's print on the coin found in the gay book store's porn peep booth.  Al ignores or forgets his training as an undercover cop.  I think he was more interested in ""getting under the covers"" with some of those oversexed studs he stared at in the bars.I hated seeing Malo turning into such a wuss during the stabbing scene in the Times Squre hotel.  He could have taken that guy, or at least fought for his life!My friend Denny did a wonderful job of cruising the guy who became the second victim who gets stabbed to death in the peep show at the book store over on Eighth Avenue.And where did the idea come from to put two drag queens in leather and high-heeled boots, stomping through the Village in this mix?!!!.  I've never seen any NY characters like that in real-life!  And then, to have two wayward cops force ""the girls"" to have sex in the back of the police car?  Please.  It was nice seeing Keith Prentice (Larry in ""Boys in the Band"") as the partner of victim #2.  He was a good actor and should have gotten more work.You could see Pacino ""changing"" during the latter part of the movie. He felt self-conscious about his body after seeing all the perfectly-built gay men and he starts to work out.  His love-making with his girlfriend became rough and abusive while the sounds of the depraved gay-bar-sex played in his head.At the end (after he has solved the crime), we see Al Pacino, dressed completely in leather, headed for a night out in the sleazy leather bars...Pacino, gives a realistic, but confused performance (as written and directed) and I enjoyed Paul Sorvino as the police chief.  I liked the film noir quality of this piece, even though it was in color.

259351,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,6301640659,PJR,"[3, 6]","Cruising seemed like superficial cheap exploitation when it came out. But I decided to give it another chance when I found a used inexpensive copy recently with director's comments and all. I think now that it stands up reasonably well for the photography and Pacino's reasonably OK acting.It is interesting to get the commentary. What were they thinking?!Also, I will take the director and producer's word for it that it is a one dimensional snapshot of a unique scene (a few leather bars) at a unique time (post-sexual revolution,pre-aids)and place (New York). They say they had to fly out from Hollywood to see if it was really true. OK, that is interesting, even though the film the scene quickly and leave. All told this is a rather three stars cheap thrills film at best.It never gets into the heads of the leatherboys or the variety of their sex play and what their various practices do for them. The commentary implied that the leatherboys were only too happy to cooperate and be seen and filmed(surprise, surprise), and that was an interesting historical note that rings quite plausible.Sorry, but it still seems after 30 years that Cruising was hastily knocked out to make some bucks and get some attention for those who made it. The dialogue is wooden. The characters are very thin and the mystery parts are gimmicky and even corny. Good lord! The killer is a mystery because he has no sperm in his semen. So what? And he is a nut case who has had problems relating to his father!! And they admit that they were switching voices on characters because they wanted to keep viewers disoriented and involved; but there was nothing artsy about it. What depth. LOL.It is implied that Pacino is being lured into the mentality he is supposed to be impersonating, but there is no character development that makes that implication in anyway interesting artistically. They do keep you wondering, but why should you be very interested in whether this more or less one-dimensional cop is some kind of closet case? OK hint, hint, kinky sex can be intoxicating. I get it. But for me that is a problem -- why just hint, hint? Show some guts and talent and put it out there and explore it. Several other good films have done that with SM -- I can't remember them all. There was one with Eastwood, 9 1/2 Weeks, Belle Du Jour, The Night Porter, Love is the Devil, even Crimes of Passion -- and a fascinating French one that I have never seen on DVD, translates roughly The Prisoner.

( I'm joking)Why did I like this movie?Because it did give atrue portrayal of the leather scene sub culture.It wasn't one of those black water melon moviesthat make todays black people cringe at.Al Pacino does give a compelling performance ofa man who is losing himself in this sub culturelife style.Is this movie worth seeing ?

259365,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,6301640659,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[10, 13]","The colossal failure of ""Cruising"" in 1980 should have been easy to predict. When you make a story about extreme taboo topics (Gay SM murders) and couple it with a bizarre, disjointed script, then outright refuse to make a linear story out of it (I could never figure out why the killer always seemed to be a different person with the same creepy voice), then you arrive with a film that hardly anyone in 1980 would sit through.Ironically enough, one of the most controversial points to the movie now seems almost nostalgic. The seedy SM underground bars like The Cellblock or The Anvil that used to inhabit lower Manhattan's Meat Packing district are a memory now, replaced by nightclubs, condos, yuppies and the locations of a bunch of ""Sex in the City"" shoots. The notorious Lure Bar, the final and long gone holdout of this era, was even used as a ""Sex in the City"" backdrop - with little or no controversy attached. How things have changed.That makes the ""shocking"" hyper-sexuality of the bar scenes somewhat bemusing. Yes, in the ""Boogie Nights"" mania of the late 70's, prior to AIDS, skyrocketing property values and Rudy Giuliani, these playspaces and these activities did happen. It was underground, wild, crazy...and as William Friedkin saw it, a perfect backdrop for a crime mystery. Al Pacino (who has professed his distaste for the final cut of ""Cruising"" and is conspicuous in his absence from the DVD extras) was keen on taking a part that would be unconventional and nonconformist. So he donned a leather jacket and took the role of Steve Burns, a young undercover cop who fits a ""common victim"" profile.Thus begins a peculiar game of cat and mouse, with Pacino trying to pass as a gay leather daddy and showing all the signs of a conflict with his inner closet. Which, in the bizarre ending to this movie, is left a hanging question...especially with the little piece of business concerning Karen Allen. There are some bits of unintended humor, like when Powers Boothe attempts to explain the Hankie Code to Pacino and when an irritated bar patron snaps at Pacino about flagging the wrong color. But for the most part, the focus on seediness and the disconnected pacing of the script keep most of ""Cruising"" at a level where the suspense is at a minimum.In fact, the most revealing thing about this ""deluxe"" DVD (hard to define it as such, since there has never been a ""basic"" edition) is the pair of featurettes. In ""The History of Cruising"" and ""Exorcising Cruising,"" Friedkin and others dissect what they were trying to accomplish with ""Cruising"" and why they didn't look at it as a gay movie. They also partially explain the ambiguity with the killer's many faces/one voice trick (giving it an almost horror/supernatural bent, and consideringThe Exorcist, hardly a stretch). A former detective who was a consultant for the movie explains the presence of the musclebound cop in the jock-strap, among other plot points. The interviews with minor cast members almost 30 years later are interesting as well.The features (in particular, ""Exorcizing Cruising"") also address the controversy. While I can see the point that there was a dearth of gay characters in the movies and therefore a gay serial killer made lots of folks virulently uneasy, I was personally more insulted byThe Boys in the Bandthan ""Cruising."" Even with the backdrop a serial killer movie, the men in the bar scenes are looking like they are hitting the bars because they belong there and are enjoying themselves; as opposed to the bitter, regretful losers of TBITB cast of closet queens.What the commentaries don't address is why ""Cruising,"" which is a dynamite movie for atmosphere and grit, was ultimately such an incoherent mess. There's a great soundtrack featuring The Germs, Mink DeVille and John Hiatt when he was punky, a twist from the usual disco-drenched music of any movie tagged as ""gay."" And finally, there is Pacino. Looking for all the world like a damaged and conflicted man, the ambiguity of the final third of ""Cruising"" (Is he gay or not? Is Burns maybe a killer, too? Who is that leatherman going into the bar at the end?) made for an unsatisfying finale. More a curiosity now than a controversy, ""Cruising"" is now a strange look into a time long passed.Incidentally, given the notorious bent to ""Cruising's"" history, it is interesting to think about some of the movies after that bear a resemblance.Hard,8MMand even modern horror movies likeHostelor theSawmovies owe a debt to ""Cruising.""",3,"On a cruise to nowhere, 27 years later",1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,4497,"['colossal', 'failure', 'Cruising', '1980', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'predict', 'When', 'make', 'story', 'extreme', 'taboo', 'topics', 'Gay', 'SM', 'murders', 'couple', 'bizarre', 'disjointed', 'script', 'then', 'outright', 'refuse', 'make', 'linear', 'story', 'could', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'killer', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'different', 'person', 'same', 'creepy', 'voice', 'then', 'arrive', 'film', 'hardly', 'anyone', '1980', 'would', 'sit', 'through.Ironically', 'enough', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'points', 'movie', 'now', 'almost', 'nostalgic', 'seedy', 'SM', 'bars', 'Cellblock', 'Anvil', 'used', 'inhabit', 'lower', 'Manhattan', 'Meat', 'Packing', 'district', 'are', 'memory', 'now', 'replaced', 'nightclubs', 'condos', 'yuppies', 'locations', 'bunch', 'Sex', 'City', 'shoots', 'notorious', 'Lure', 'Bar', 'final', 'long', 'gone', 'holdout', 'era', 'was', 'even', 'used', 'Sex', 'City', 'backdrop', 'little', 'controversy', 'attached', 'How', 'things', 'have', 'changed.That', 'shocking', 'hyper-sexuality', 'bar', 'scenes', 'somewhat', 'bemusing', 'Yes', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'mania', 'late', '70', 'prior', 'AIDS', 'skyrocketing', 'property', 'values', 'Rudy', 'Giuliani', 'playspaces', 'activities', 'did', 'happen', 'was', 'underground', 'wild', 'crazy', 'William', 'Friedkin', 'saw', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'crime', 'mystery', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'who', 'professed', 'distaste', 'final', 'cut', 'Cruising', 'conspicuous', 'absence', 'DVD', 'extras', 'was', 'keen', 'taking', 'part', 'would', 'be', 'unconventional', 'nonconformist', 'donned', 'leather', 'jacket', 'took', 'role', 'Steve', 'Burns', 'young', 'undercover', 'cop', 'who', 'common', 'victim', 'profile.Thus', 'peculiar', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Pacino', 'trying', 'pass', 'gay', 'leather', 'daddy', 'showing', 'signs', 'conflict', 'inner', 'closet', 'Which', 'bizarre', 'ending', 'movie', 'left', 'hanging', 'question', 'especially', 'little', 'piece', 'business', 'concerning', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'are', 'bits', 'unintended', 'humor', 'when', 'Powers', 'Boothe', 'attempts', 'explain', 'Hankie', 'Code', 'Pacino', 'when', 'irritated', 'bar', 'patron', 'snaps', 'Pacino', 'flagging', 'wrong', 'color', 'most', 'part', 'focus', 'seediness', 'disconnected', 'pacing', 'script', 'most', 'Cruising', 'level', 'where', 'suspense', 'minimum.In', 'fact', 'most', 'revealing', 'thing', 'deluxe', 'DVD', 'hard', 'define', 'such', 'never', 'been', 'basic', 'edition', 'pair', 'featurettes', 'History', 'Cruising', 'Exorcising', 'Cruising', 'Friedkin', 'others', 'dissect', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'Cruising', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'gay', 'movie', 'also', 'partially', 'explain', 'ambiguity', 'killer', 'many', 'faces/one', 'voice', 'trick', 'giving', 'almost', 'horror/supernatural', 'bent', 'consideringThe', 'Exorcist', 'hardly', 'stretch', 'former', 'detective', 'who', 'was', 'consultant', 'movie', 'presence', 'musclebound', 'cop', 'jock-strap', 'other', 'plot', 'points', 'interviews', 'minor', 'cast', 'members', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'interesting', 'well.The', 'features', 'particular', 'Exorcizing', 'Cruising', 'also', 'address', 'controversy', 'can', 'see', 'point', 'was', 'dearth', 'gay', 'characters', 'movies', 'therefore', 'gay', 'serial', 'killer', 'made', 'lots', 'folks', 'virulently', 'uneasy', 'was', 'personally', 'more', 'insulted', 'byThe', 'Boys', 'Bandthan', 'Cruising', 'Even', 'backdrop', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'men', 'bar', 'scenes', 'are', 'looking', 'are', 'hitting', 'bars', 'belong', 'there', 'are', 'enjoying', 'opposed', 'bitter', 'regretful', 'losers', 'TBITB', 'cast', 'closet', 'commentaries', 'do', ""n't"", 'address', 'why', 'Cruising', 'dynamite', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'grit', 'was', 'ultimately', 'such', 'incoherent', 'mess', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'Germs', 'Mink', 'DeVille', 'John', 'Hiatt', 'when', 'was', 'punky', 'twist', 'usual', 'disco-drenched', 'music', 'movie', 'tagged', 'gay', 'finally', 'Pacino', 'Looking', 'world', 'damaged', 'conflicted', 'man', 'ambiguity', 'final', 'third', 'Cruising', 'not', 'Burns', 'maybe', 'killer', 'too', 'Who', 'leatherman', 'going', 'bar', 'end', 'made', 'unsatisfying', 'finale', 'More', 'curiosity', 'now', 'controversy', 'Cruising', 'now', 'strange', 'look', 'time', 'long', 'passed.Incidentally', 'given', 'notorious', 'bent', 'Cruising', 'history', 'interesting', 'think', 'movies', 'bear', 'resemblance.Hard,8MMand', 'even', 'modern', 'horror', 'movies', 'likeHostelor', 'theSawmovies', 'owe', 'debt', 'Cruising']",Cruising VHS

This sub-culture of leathermen in leatherbar is truly bizarre and Friedkin captures the atmosphere precisely.Pacino's performance must have been one of the hardest he had to do since there are so many layers of sexuality and doubt and mystery surrounding his character that to give a convincing portrayal of a possible murderer of gay men must have tested his acting abilities to the limit.  He succeeds.Since today is World Aids Day - 1 Dec 2007 - I am just wondering how many of the ""extras"" are still alive since their performances are so real and convincing.
