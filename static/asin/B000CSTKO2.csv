The ""Movemaster"" section was supposed to help those of us who are challenged with step aerobics and it doesn't help at ALL!  She goes straight through the combos which twirl around, over, up, stretch, kick, knee up without slowing down or breaking the steps down.  There is no way I can ""master each move to perfection"" as advertised.  This DVD is a joke!  And the ""Invisible Warm Up""  ha!  She jumps right into aerobics without stretching anything BUT then I couldn't keep up anyway because she changed everything so fast.  NOT FUN!  WASTE OF MY MONEY when I thought I would get a DVD with Step Aerobics I could do!

She is totally profesional and a joy to watch.  She has great personality, and she knows her stuff.  She is so quick on the step, I don't know how she calls out all the moves.  She'll cues exceptionally well - she'll sing out the cues to the tune of the great music her dvds have.  This one has We Will Rock You, Heard It Through The Grapevine and I Love Rock and Roll to name a few.  She's quick and on the ball.  The choreography is sometimes complex, but once you've done it a couple of times, you'll get the hang of it and wonder how on earth you are doing it.  If you are still stuck, there are some exercisers in the back row, who do easier versions that makes following easier.  There is also a bonus ab workout.  Christie really is the very best instructor and fun to watch.",5,The best instructor EVER,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,910,"['bought', 'Collage', 'Video', 'time', 'have', 'Christies', 'workouts', 'reason', 'have', 'AMAZING', 'totally', 'profesional', 'joy', 'watch', 'great', 'personality', 'stuff', 'so', 'quick', 'step', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'out', 'moves', ""'ll"", 'cues', 'exceptionally', 'well', ""'ll"", 'sing', 'out', 'cues', 'tune', 'great', 'music', 'dvds', 'have', 'one', 'Will', 'Rock', 'Heard', 'Grapevine', 'Love', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'name', 'few', 'quick', 'ball', 'choreography', 'sometimes', 'complex', 'once', ""'ve"", 'done', 'couple', 'times', ""'ll"", 'get', 'hang', 'wonder', 'how', 'earth', 'are', 'doing', 'are', 'still', 'stuck', 'are', 'exercisers', 'back', 'row', 'who', 'do', 'easier', 'versions', 'following', 'easier', 'also', 'bonus', 'ab', 'workout', 'Christie', 'really', 'very', 'best', 'instructor', 'fun', 'watch']",Christi Taylor: Totally Cool Step - Step Aerobic Workout
962548,A39UVOHPGARCM,B000CSTKO2,Lori T. Sly,"[1, 2]","I do not like overcomplicated stepping routines with lots of twisting and turning, and this was such a video.  I tried it twice, and had to concentrate so hard on not tripping and falling, that I got a poor workout. I don't mind having to take 2-10 times to really learn a routine and follow it well, but this one discouraged me, making me think it would take forever to get, and I might eventually hurt myself in the process.  It's for very coordinated people, not me!  I like good workout and a bit of a challenge in following to keep me interested, but not this much.

962549,A6NOM7R41JXQG,B000CSTKO2,N. Armstrong,"[2, 2]","If you are a beginner, this DVD is not for you.  Christi does not detail the steps with you at the beginning.  The routine goes directlly into a fast pace, with many different steps, hard to keep up with if you don't know the routine.  If she had started out with a slow version, for us to learn it first, then speed it up, that would be better.  She tells you the name of each step, but if you are not familiar with those steps, it doesn't help.  Certainly the girls in the DVD have worked many hours to perfect these steps at a fast, continuous pace, but as a first time viewer, very hard to catch on.",3,Not for beginners.,1267747200,"03 5, 2010",2010,603,"['are', 'beginner', 'DVD', 'not', 'Christi', 'not', 'detail', 'steps', 'beginning', 'routine', 'directlly', 'fast', 'pace', 'many', 'different', 'steps', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'routine', 'had', 'started', 'out', 'slow', 'version', 'learn', 'first', 'then', 'speed', 'up', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'name', 'step', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'steps', ""n't"", 'help', 'Certainly', 'girls', 'DVD', 'have', 'worked', 'many', 'hours', 'perfect', 'steps', 'fast', 'continuous', 'pace', 'first', 'time', 'viewer', 'very', 'hard', 'catch']",Christi Taylor: Totally Cool Step - Step Aerobic Workout

I really wanted to add some new routines to my step workout and thought I'd try some Christi Taylor workouts due to their high ratings. I purchased her Mission Possible along with this dvd. First off, I consider myself an intermediate/advanced stepper...I am not new to step. I realize whenever I work with a new routine, there's going to be a learning curve. I found this dvd to be so frustrating. I quit before finishing the workout. Instead of feeling as though I'd exercised, I was angry. I think it will take some time to learn her moves. Even the &#34;move master&#34; doesn't repeat enough, and any turning move is problematic because your back is to the screen some of the time. I will give it another try, but will expect to start and stop the dvd frequently so as to better learn the move. If you're familiar with Christi Taylor, you will probably like this dvd. If you've not done her routines before or are new to step, expect a steep learning curve.",3,Advanced,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,1001,"['years', ""'ve"", 'had', 'only', 'one', 'step', 'dvd', 'really', 'wanted', 'add', 'new', 'routines', 'step', 'workout', 'thought', ""'d"", 'try', 'Christi', 'Taylor', 'workouts', 'due', 'high', 'ratings', 'purchased', 'Mission', 'Possible', 'dvd', 'First', 'consider', 'intermediate/advanced', 'stepper', 'am', 'not', 'new', 'step', 'realize', 'whenever', 'work', 'new', 'routine', 'going', 'be', 'learning', 'curve', 'found', 'dvd', 'be', 'so', 'frustrating', 'quit', 'finishing', 'workout', 'Instead', 'feeling', ""'d"", 'exercised', 'was', 'angry', 'think', 'will', 'take', 'time', 'learn', 'moves', 'Even', '34', 'move', 'master', '34', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'enough', 'turning', 'move', 'problematic', 'back', 'screen', 'time', 'will', 'give', 'try', 'will', 'expect', 'start', 'stop', 'dvd', 'frequently', 'so', 'better', 'learn', 'move', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Christi', 'Taylor', 'will', 'probably', 'dvd', ""'ve"", 'not', 'done', 'routines', 'are', 'new', 'step', 'expect', 'steep', 'learning', 'curve']",Christi Taylor: Totally Cool Step - Step Aerobic Workout

On this particular DVD, her enthusiasm is contagious.  She sings, moves and steps along with the music with a ton of energy!I like the modifiers on this DVD.  They show you how to keep moving while learning the more difficult DVD's.  It will take a few times to learn the ""flipper"" moves, but, it will be worth the practice, because your body will change while you're learning.My heart rate stayed up the entire time I was practicing this DVD even with the modified moves.  I also did the Bonus Cardio, which is a repeat of the entire routine, without the beginning instruction so you feel like you are in a dance show.Love this DVD..I did sweat and keep my heart-rate up!Thank you Christi",5,I'm a fan!,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,762,"['Christi', 'Taylor', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'aerobic/step', 'instructors', 'particular', 'DVD', 'enthusiasm', 'contagious', 'moves', 'steps', 'music', 'ton', 'energy', 'modifiers', 'DVD', 'show', 'how', 'keep', 'moving', 'learning', 'more', 'difficult', 'DVD', 'will', 'take', 'few', 'times', 'learn', 'flipper', 'moves', 'will', 'be', 'practice', 'body', 'will', 'change', ""'re"", 'learning.My', 'heart', 'rate', 'stayed', 'up', 'entire', 'time', 'was', 'practicing', 'DVD', 'even', 'modified', 'moves', 'also', 'did', 'Bonus', 'Cardio', 'repeat', 'entire', 'routine', 'beginning', 'instruction', 'feel', 'are', 'dance', 'show.Love', 'DVD..I', 'did', 'sweat', 'keep', 'heart-rate', 'up', 'Thank', 'Christi']",Christi Taylor: Totally Cool Step - Step Aerobic Workout
