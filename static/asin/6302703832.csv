328411,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6302703832,Charles Ashbacher,"[28, 29]","Anyone who thinks that the horror of nuclear war makes it impossible should read ""The Guns of August"" by Barbara Tuchman. Immediately after the Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated by Serbian agents, it appeared to be a crisis, but not a severe one. Then suddenly, it all spiraled out of control into a conflagration that engulfed the world, which is now known as World War I. Monarchs signed decrees that led to their dethronement and in one case, their death and the entire order of Europe was destroyed. The leaders were pushed to a point where they felt their only option was to have their nations fight to the death. This tape is based on that book and on the whole, gives a reasonably accurate portrayal of the events of that time.One omission is a brief rehash of the Franco-Prussian war, the subsequent German annexation of Alsace-Lorraine and the French desire for revenge. This was the strongest force among the French that pushed them towards the war. The narrative is also somewhat biased against the central powers, in that the footage is almost exclusively  from the allied side. The critical involvement of Turkey on the side of the central powers is also ignored. If Turkey had at minimum stayed neutral instead of entering the war on the side of the central powers, it is most likely that the war would have ended in 1917. Had she entered the war on the side of the allies, it may have ended even earlier. Of all the countries who was heavily engaged, she was the one who most easily could have stayed out.Diplomacy and statecraft will never be exact sciences, so nothing is ever certain. If you read the book or see this tape, you will learn how true that is. Our only hope to do better next time is to understand the mistakes of the last times. This tape is a reasonably accurate portrayal of how what should have been a minor event can escalate to a disaster due to inept leadership, a lesson that should be re-learned on a regular basis.",4,Demonstration of statecraft at its' worst,1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,1957,"['Anyone', 'who', 'horror', 'nuclear', 'war', 'impossible', 'should', 'read', 'Guns', 'August', 'Barbara', 'Tuchman', 'Immediately', 'Archduke', 'Ferdinand', 'was', 'assassinated', 'Serbian', 'agents', 'appeared', 'be', 'crisis', 'not', 'severe', 'one', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'spiraled', 'control', 'conflagration', 'engulfed', 'world', 'now', 'known', 'World', 'War', 'Monarchs', 'signed', 'decrees', 'led', 'dethronement', 'one', 'case', 'death', 'entire', 'order', 'Europe', 'was', 'destroyed', 'leaders', 'were', 'pushed', 'point', 'where', 'felt', 'only', 'option', 'was', 'have', 'nations', 'fight', 'death', 'tape', 'based', 'book', 'whole', 'reasonably', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'events', 'time.One', 'omission', 'brief', 'rehash', 'Franco-Prussian', 'war', 'subsequent', 'German', 'annexation', 'Alsace-Lorraine', 'French', 'desire', 'revenge', 'was', 'strongest', 'force', 'French', 'pushed', 'war', 'narrative', 'also', 'somewhat', 'biased', 'central', 'powers', 'footage', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'allied', 'side', 'critical', 'involvement', 'Turkey', 'side', 'central', 'powers', 'also', 'ignored', 'Turkey', 'had', 'minimum', 'stayed', 'neutral', 'instead', 'entering', 'war', 'side', 'central', 'powers', 'most', 'likely', 'war', 'would', 'have', 'ended', '1917', 'Had', 'entered', 'war', 'side', 'allies', 'may', 'have', 'ended', 'even', 'earlier', 'countries', 'who', 'was', 'heavily', 'engaged', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'stayed', 'out.Diplomacy', 'statecraft', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'exact', 'sciences', 'nothing', 'ever', 'certain', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'tape', 'will', 'learn', 'how', 'true', 'only', 'hope', 'do', 'better', 'next', 'time', 'understand', 'mistakes', 'last', 'times', 'tape', 'reasonably', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'how', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'minor', 'event', 'can', 'escalate', 'disaster', 'due', 'inept', 'leadership', 'lesson', 'should', 'be', 're-learned', 'regular', 'basis']",N/A

328414,A2ZNJKY01ANDHG,6302703832,"John A. Kuczma ""RogueUlfric""","[35, 36]","The Guns of August takes its title, its pace and its studious approach to the events of the First World War from Barbara Tuchman's extraordinary book.  The film cannot provide the detail or the masterful objectivity of  the book, and wisely makes no attempt to be a visual clone.Although both  start well before the beginning of hostilities, the printed version draws  to a close at the end of August 1914, whereas the movie takes us through to  the cessasation of the fighting.A great deal of archival film is  included in this ambitious production, adding to the authenticity and the  odd sense of disbelief one gains as the incredible series of  miscalculations leading to war unfold before the viewer's eyes.The Guns  of August is presented in a straight-forward documentary style, making no  effort to embellish the accounts included or to make itself entertaining.  It is a thoughtful, often morose recounting of the tragic events that  consumed an entire generation of Europe's fighting men and untold numbers  of innocent civilians unable to avoid its terrible path.  It leaves the  viewer unable to believe that such horrors could be loosed on the world  again, yet knowing that they were a scant two decades later.For any  student of military or political science, this is a film not to be missed.  The awful depiction of the results of failed diplomacy is a lesson not to  be dismissed, lest it must be relearned yet again.",5,Builds on the foundation of Tuchman's literary masterpiece.,945648000,"12 20, 1999",1999,1434,"['Guns', 'August', 'title', 'pace', 'studious', 'approach', 'events', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'Barbara', 'Tuchman', 'extraordinary', 'book', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'provide', 'detail', 'masterful', 'objectivity', 'book', 'wisely', 'attempt', 'be', 'visual', 'clone.Although', 'start', 'well', 'beginning', 'hostilities', 'printed', 'version', 'close', 'end', 'August', '1914', 'whereas', 'movie', 'cessasation', 'fighting.A', 'great', 'deal', 'archival', 'film', 'included', 'ambitious', 'production', 'adding', 'authenticity', 'odd', 'sense', 'disbelief', 'one', 'gains', 'incredible', 'series', 'miscalculations', 'leading', 'war', 'unfold', 'viewer', 'eyes.The', 'Guns', 'August', 'presented', 'straight-forward', 'documentary', 'style', 'making', 'effort', 'embellish', 'accounts', 'included', 'make', 'entertaining', 'thoughtful', 'often', 'morose', 'recounting', 'tragic', 'events', 'consumed', 'entire', 'generation', 'Europe', 'fighting', 'men', 'untold', 'numbers', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'unable', 'avoid', 'terrible', 'path', 'viewer', 'unable', 'believe', 'such', 'horrors', 'could', 'be', 'loosed', 'world', 'again', 'yet', 'knowing', 'were', 'scant', 'two', 'decades', 'later.For', 'student', 'military', 'political', 'science', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'awful', 'depiction', 'results', 'failed', 'diplomacy', 'lesson', 'not', 'be', 'dismissed', 'must', 'be', 'relearned', 'yet', 'again']",N/A
