I just finished watching it on DVD and I am truly moved not only by your artistry and confidence in filmmaking but also by the subject you so sensitively depict.  You created an immense emotional human drama from a taboo subject.Fortunately social norms are in constant change, but we are still living with so many stigmatized topics from the past, and films like yours bring a great contribution to slowly but surely erase society's negative behavior about unusual or dissimilar people.  We are all human beings made of the same stuff.Your film is HONEST.  You succeeded to create a non-exploitive wonderful film encouraging us to be sensitive to each other, understand and enjoy the diversity this noble nature is offering.  The major characters in your film are interesting, different and talented, young Alex and Alvaro are convincing and touching.I will cherish this film for a long, long time to come.  I will recommend to all my friends and eagerly waiting for your next creation.

1172442,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B001BMN35K,Charles Ashbacher,"[1, 1]","As the gay rights movement becomes stronger around the world, it is becoming clear that for some, the issue of gender identity is greater than that of where they are psychologically. In this movie, the fifteen-year-old Alex is a true hermaphrodite, having the functional sex organs of both genders, although she urinates like a man. When she was born, the doctors wanted to surgically remove the ambiguity, but her parents (really her father) refused to allow it.Now that Alex is developing a sexual identity and is interacting with boys where there are sexual undertones, the matter has become critical. A surgeon friend and his wife are visiting Alex's family and they have a boy Alex's age. Alex's mother invited them so that there could be a discussion of Alex's condition and the surgeon is experienced in removing physical gender ambiguities.Alexis very uncertain regarding what she wants, she feels the enormous social pressure to choose which way she wants to go. In this instance, her father is very helpful; he has deliberately waited until Alex was old enough to make the decision, feeling it would be wrong to make it for her. To aid him in his dealing with the issue, Alex's father consults a man that was born ambiguous and had it ""fixed"" at a young age. Living as a man, he openly admits that he sometimes wonders how things would have been different had the surgery not been performed.This is a very well done movie; you feel the turmoil in Alex as she deals with the pressure of being considered a freak by most of her society. The struggles of the parents in dealing with issues of gender identity when the child can literally be either gender will yank the emotional strings of all parents. However, your thoughts on what should be done are as ambiguous as Alex's gender; it is hard to reach a conclusion as to what you think should be done.This situation is not as rare as one might think; years ago when I was writing a book about non-standard logic I investigated gender ambiguity as an instance where a logic of uncertainty could be applied. Somewhere between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births are ambiguous enough to become the subject of surgical interest, most are surgically ""corrected"" shortly after birth. This movie is a powerful statement about the tensions that people with gender ambiguity face as they try to integrate themselves into a society that does not know how to deal with them.",5,Is it really necessary to choose?,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,2415,"['gay', 'rights', 'movement', 'becomes', 'stronger', 'world', 'becoming', 'clear', 'issue', 'gender', 'identity', 'greater', 'where', 'are', 'psychologically', 'movie', 'fifteen-year-old', 'Alex', 'true', 'hermaphrodite', 'having', 'functional', 'sex', 'organs', 'genders', 'man', 'When', 'was', 'born', 'doctors', 'wanted', 'surgically', 'remove', 'ambiguity', 'parents', 'really', 'father', 'refused', 'allow', 'it.Now', 'Alex', 'developing', 'sexual', 'identity', 'interacting', 'boys', 'where', 'are', 'sexual', 'undertones', 'matter', 'become', 'critical', 'surgeon', 'friend', 'wife', 'are', 'visiting', 'Alex', 'family', 'have', 'boy', 'Alex', 'age', 'Alex', 'mother', 'invited', 'so', 'could', 'be', 'discussion', 'Alex', 'condition', 'surgeon', 'experienced', 'removing', 'physical', 'gender', 'ambiguities.Alexis', 'very', 'uncertain', 'regarding', 'what', 'enormous', 'social', 'pressure', 'choose', 'way', 'go', 'instance', 'father', 'very', 'helpful', 'deliberately', 'waited', 'Alex', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'make', 'decision', 'feeling', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'make', 'aid', 'dealing', 'issue', 'Alex', 'father', 'consults', 'man', 'was', 'born', 'ambiguous', 'had', 'fixed', 'young', 'age', 'Living', 'man', 'openly', 'how', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'had', 'surgery', 'not', 'been', 'performed.This', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'feel', 'turmoil', 'Alex', 'pressure', 'being', 'considered', 'freak', 'most', 'society', 'struggles', 'parents', 'dealing', 'issues', 'gender', 'identity', 'when', 'child', 'can', 'literally', 'be', 'gender', 'will', 'yank', 'emotional', 'strings', 'parents', 'However', 'thoughts', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'are', 'as', 'ambiguous', 'Alex', 'gender', 'hard', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'what', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'done.This', 'situation', 'not', 'as', 'rare', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'writing', 'book', 'non-standard', 'logic', 'investigated', 'gender', 'ambiguity', 'instance', 'where', 'logic', 'uncertainty', 'could', 'be', 'applied', 'Somewhere', '0.1', '%', '0.2', '%', 'live', 'births', 'are', 'ambiguous', 'enough', 'become', 'subject', 'surgical', 'interest', 'most', 'are', 'surgically', 'corrected', 'shortly', 'birth', 'movie', 'powerful', 'statement', 'tensions', 'people', 'gender', 'ambiguity', 'face', 'try', 'integrate', 'society', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'deal']",XXy

Unlike many films with content of this nature,meaning sexual ambiguity,Inter Sexism,Transgender issues or anything that strays away from the male or female ""norm"". Norm or normal not being my words but society's.XXY is heartbreaking and tense in some scenes,Loving and accepting in others.Most of the acceptance comes from her father who thinks she ""Alex"" is perfect just the way she is and she herself is accepting of who she is so she stops taking the female hormones that will alter her body to be more feminine because  she is confused and not sure what gender she really identifies with or maybe she just identifies with both.Something most people do on some levels.This film brought me to tears in several scenes because I understand the pain and weight of the ""what if someone finds out factor"". The surgeons son that is visiting Alex's family starts hanging out with Alex and she becomes quite sexually aggressive with him straight out of the gate.He shy's away at first,not because of her XXY condition  because he is unaware of it even though his father is there to see if all involved will allow an operation to fix Alex's so called handicap.When they do have sex I was shocked at what occurred and that they showed it.I wasn't shocked as in it doesn't happen but as in that they had the guts to actually show the act itself.There is also a very disturbing scene where three boys ""older"" decide they want to see for themselves what she has as they say ""down there"".She was so tough and bold throughout the film that when this occurs you finally see how emotionally and physically vulnerable she really is.It's a film that would be entertaining to anyone not just someone close to this issue.I say bravo to the film makers and writers for being so brutally honest,after all this is how it really is.",5,Bold and Uncompromising,1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,1985,"['have', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'amazing', 'film', '.I', 'was', 'amazed', 'did', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'tip', 'toe', 'issues', 'was', 'clear', 'day', 'directly', 'point', 'many', 'films', 'content', 'nature', 'meaning', 'sexual', 'ambiguity', 'Inter', 'Sexism', 'Transgender', 'issues', 'anything', 'away', 'male', 'female', 'norm', 'Norm', 'normal', 'not', 'being', 'words', ""society's.XXY"", 'heartbreaking', 'tense', 'scenes', 'Loving', 'accepting', 'others.Most', 'acceptance', 'father', 'who', 'Alex', 'perfect', 'just', 'way', 'accepting', 'who', 'so', 'taking', 'female', 'hormones', 'will', 'alter', 'body', 'be', 'more', 'feminine', 'confused', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'gender', 'really', 'maybe', 'just', 'identifies', 'both.Something', 'most', 'people', 'do', 'levels.This', 'film', 'brought', 'tears', 'several', 'scenes', 'understand', 'pain', 'weight', 'what', 'someone', 'out', 'factor', 'surgeons', 'son', 'visiting', 'Alex', 'family', 'hanging', 'out', 'Alex', 'quite', 'sexually', 'aggressive', 'straight', 'gate.He', 'shy', 'away', 'first', 'not', 'XXY', 'condition', 'unaware', 'even', 'father', 'there', 'see', 'involved', 'will', 'allow', 'operation', 'fix', 'Alex', 'so', 'called', 'handicap.When', 'do', 'have', 'sex', 'was', 'shocked', 'what', 'occurred', 'showed', 'it.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'shocked', ""n't"", 'happen', 'had', 'guts', 'actually', 'show', 'act', 'itself.There', 'also', 'very', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'where', 'three', 'older', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'say', 'down', 'there', '.She', 'was', 'so', 'tough', 'bold', 'film', 'when', 'finally', 'see', 'how', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'vulnerable', 'really', 'is.It', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'entertaining', 'anyone', 'not', 'just', 'someone', 'close', 'issue.I', 'say', 'bravo', 'film', 'makers', 'writers', 'being', 'so', 'brutally', 'honest', 'how', 'really']",XXy
1172444,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001BMN35K,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","XXY (a/k/a ""XXy"", 2007, 85 minutes, in VERY bad Spanish with subtitles) is perhaps one of the most disgusting films I have ever seen, precisely because it pretends to deal with a true and painful subject: it deals with a hermaphrodite teen. It addresses a few items about the subject but is generally just plain awful. It's a pretentious, arrogant and nearly impossible-to-follow piece of Eurotrash even if they do say it is from Argentina.The victim of the day here is beautiful young Mexican actress In&eacute;s Efron who plays Alex, a hermaphrodite who seems to have been raised as a girl by her parents. Though her father lovingly accepts Alex's true physical condition, it appears he struggles a bit with Alex's psychology--well, who wouldn't?! The title is mostly a symbol.However, if I may: XXY, a/k/a Klinefelter's Syndrome, is a type of hermaphroditism. What is typically seen is a male who has very small testicles and insufficient hormones to carry him all the way to ""normal"" malehood. The result is a male child, but a child suffering from female characteristics that can be painful, dangerous and even life-threatening (they have breasts and usually get breast cancer). One extremely interesting characteristic is XXY kids tend to be much taller than their peers, and this is usually due to abnormally long legs.My old review had a loud complaint posted about Alex's ""issue"" that is being swept under the rug--and I was insulted just for pointing out what the movie tells us up-front. In an ugly 'rape' scene (I call this 'non-sexual rape') Alex is forcibly undressed in order to see if the rumors are true. What the boys see after they have attacked and brutalized Alex goes beyond the rumors.So what the hell issue is THAT? Is it not hermaphroditism?--they SAY SO in the film! Alex's father states Alex was born a hermaphrodite and that's not a euphemism for ""gay""! This isn't about your average gay teen, and THAT is the whole point of this movie. Alex's father defends and accepts her.The rest of this film is so distasteful that I will leave it up to you to decide. I find it far too intense and frankly a bit dishonest to recommend it at all--and I definitely would not recommend it for kids. All I can do to ease this attitude is to praise them for making a film about a true physical medical hermaphrodite--surely a way to get everyone's attention.However, these issues need to be approached with respect, as educational issues and not in the way this film does it, with exploitation.Since I devoted my 23-year ministry to fight for the rights of all transgender people, the gay community, and everyone else who falls on the spectrum, from bisexual to true hermaphrodite, I will not dignify this film with anything other than this review and a strong warning. It was a disrespectful approach to a horrid set of problems this world suffers--but we need to really understand those who are really suffering.I can't fathom this representing Argentina at the Oscars for Best Foreign Film--and that should be a big red flag for film buffs. What this does tell us is the entire subject requires a good, well-directed film on the subject. I am truly sorry for those review-readers out there who can't read well enough to understand what this review is trying to say.Two stars, one for the young actors and one for trying.",2,"Not the right delivery system for this message, or, How about a little RESPECT?!",1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,3335,"['XXY', 'XXy', '2007', '85', 'minutes', 'VERY', 'bad', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'disgusting', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'precisely', 'deal', 'true', 'painful', 'subject', 'hermaphrodite', 'teen', 'few', 'items', 'subject', 'generally', 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'pretentious', 'arrogant', 'nearly', 'impossible-to-follow', 'piece', 'Eurotrash', 'even', 'do', 'say', 'Argentina.The', 'victim', 'day', 'here', 'beautiful', 'young', 'Mexican', 'actress', 'eacute', 'Efron', 'who', 'Alex', 'hermaphrodite', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'raised', 'girl', 'parents', 'father', 'lovingly', 'Alex', 'true', 'physical', 'condition', 'bit', 'Alex', 'psychology', 'well', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'title', 'mostly', 'symbol.However', 'may', 'XXY', 'a/k/a', 'Klinefelter', 'Syndrome', 'type', 'hermaphroditism', 'What', 'typically', 'seen', 'male', 'who', 'very', 'small', 'testicles', 'insufficient', 'hormones', 'carry', 'way', 'normal', 'malehood', 'result', 'male', 'child', 'child', 'suffering', 'female', 'characteristics', 'can', 'be', 'painful', 'dangerous', 'even', 'life-threatening', 'have', 'breasts', 'usually', 'get', 'breast', 'cancer', 'One', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'characteristic', 'XXY', 'kids', 'tend', 'be', 'much', 'taller', 'peers', 'usually', 'due', 'abnormally', 'long', 'legs.My', 'old', 'review', 'had', 'loud', 'complaint', 'posted', 'Alex', 'issue', 'being', 'swept', 'rug', 'was', 'insulted', 'just', 'pointing', 'out', 'what', 'movie', 'up-front', 'ugly', ""'rape"", 'scene', 'call', ""'non-sexual"", 'rape', 'Alex', 'forcibly', 'undressed', 'order', 'see', 'rumors', 'are', 'true', 'What', 'boys', 'see', 'have', 'attacked', 'brutalized', 'Alex', 'rumors.So', 'what', 'hell', 'issue', 'not', 'hermaphroditism', 'SAY', 'SO', 'film', 'Alex', 'father', 'states', 'Alex', 'was', 'born', 'hermaphrodite', 'not', 'euphemism', 'gay', ""n't"", 'average', 'gay', 'teen', 'THAT', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'Alex', 'father', 'defends', 'her.The', 'rest', 'film', 'so', 'distasteful', 'will', 'leave', 'up', 'decide', 'find', 'far', 'too', 'intense', 'frankly', 'bit', 'dishonest', 'recommend', 'definitely', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'kids', 'can', 'do', 'ease', 'attitude', 'praise', 'making', 'film', 'true', 'physical', 'medical', 'hermaphrodite', 'surely', 'way', 'get', 'everyone', 'attention.However', 'issues', 'need', 'be', 'approached', 'respect', 'educational', 'issues', 'not', 'way', 'film', 'exploitation.Since', 'devoted', '23-year', 'ministry', 'fight', 'rights', 'transgender', 'people', 'gay', 'community', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'spectrum', 'bisexual', 'true', 'hermaphrodite', 'will', 'not', 'dignify', 'film', 'anything', 'other', 'review', 'strong', 'warning', 'was', 'disrespectful', 'approach', 'horrid', 'set', 'problems', 'world', 'need', 'really', 'understand', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'suffering.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'representing', 'Argentina', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'should', 'be', 'big', 'red', 'flag', 'film', 'buffs', 'What', 'tell', 'entire', 'subject', 'good', 'well-directed', 'film', 'subject', 'am', 'truly', 'sorry', 'review-readers', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'well', 'enough', 'understand', 'what', 'review', 'trying', 'say.Two', 'stars', 'one', 'young', 'actors', 'one', 'trying']",XXy
1172445,A129PCCR3F6J2Y,B001BMN35K,"Elliot ""Son of Nietzsche""","[24, 26]","15 year old Alex (In&eacute;s Efron) was born intersex; she resembles a female (and takes hormones to enhance this), but has male genitals. As she has grown older, her parents moved her from her home in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to an isolated fishing village on the coast of Uruguay, to avoid the questions of friends and relatives. Her mother is desperate for her to become wholly female, and invites a plastic surgeon (along with his wife and son) to their village to discuss surgical options. The son, Alvaro (Martin Piroyansky), is questioning his own sexuality...which becomes all the more confused as he and Alex grow attracted to one another.XXY (Spanish, English subtitles) deals with age-old themes (social stigma, parental conflict, societal demands for sexual conformity) in a refreshing context. What does it mean to be 'male' or 'female'? Is the pressure to choose one gender or another innate, or socially-enforced? Are the neuroses that young people suffer wholly attributable to parental desire for social orthodoxy? A post-op female-to-male acquaintance of Alex's father advises: ""Making her afraid of her body is the worst thing you can do to a child""...(oddly reminiscent of Van Dijk's classic quote: ""Sexuality is something granted to everyone, and to teach a child to abstain from this evident intimacy is perhaps the first form of sexual violence to which it is subjected""). XXY does not seek to resolve these (perhaps unresolvable) questions, but does an excellent job of casting light onto such neglected areas of social life.The acting is remarkable for what must have been challenging roles; completely natural and unselfconscious. The lead characters do a superb job of conveying (frequently through body language and eye movement) the turmoil that they undergo, but credit also to an exceptional supporting cast, including the powerful performance of Ricardo Dar&iacute;n in the role of Alex's father. The camera work and lighting combine with these other aspects to result in a moody, poignant and most memorable film.

1172446,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001BMN35K,Grady Harp,"[41, 43]","The chromosomal abnormality of XXY has been labeled as Klinefelter's Syndrome, hermaphroditism, and Intersex.  The 'conception' defect results in a child with both male and female organs and when detected at birth usually results in a decision between physicians and parents to surgically alter the child to be one or the other phenotypic assignments - male or female.  In this remarkably sensitive film based on a short story 'Cinismo' by Sergio Bizzio and adapted for the screen by writer/director Luc&iacute;a Puenzo, XXY becomes a story of understanding and acceptance of a diagnosis by both child and parents and the conflicts such gender variation can present.Alex (In&eacute;s Efron) is the XXY patient of the story, having been raised on the isolated coastline of Uruguay as a girl with the aid of supplemental hormones until age 15, the age when her loving Argentinean parents Kraken (Ricardo Dar&iacute;n) and Suli (Valeria Bertuccelli) have decided she should have her 'offending member' removed, allowing her to become a completely phenotypic female.  Alex is deeply conflicted about her situation, refuses to take her medications and enjoys being 'one of the boys' in secret.  When Alex's parents invite their surgeon friend Ramiro (Germ&aacute;n Palacios) and his wife Erika (Carolina Pelleritti) to their home to advise them on the surgical alternatives, they are accompanied by their artistic son Alvaro (Mart&iacute;n Piroyansky). There is an attraction between Alex and Alvaro and this ultimately results in a crisis that results in the coming of age and self-acceptance of both youngsters. Luc&iacute;a Puenzo and her fine cast sensitively explore the interaction between parents and children and the coming to grips with choice of identity.  This is yet another challenging and rewarding film from Argentina, one that stands alone as a fine movie, but one that also would be wise to add to the film libraries  of high school and college students and of patient resource facilities who deal with problems of gender identity.

1172447,AOS6E2MVT8ZL0,B001BMN35K,"Judy Croome ""Judy Croome | @judy_croome""","[3, 4]","XXY is a sensitive and poignant portrayal of the issues facing intersex people. The issues raised for both the intersexed person and their families, the callousness of the medical scientists (to whom the intersexed person is an object for study rather than a person) and how town communities react were unflinchingly examined. Humanity is supposedly civilised, but still as cruel as ever to anything considered different from the norm (the parallel cruelty to the endangered turtles was also significant.)Both acting and directing in this movie is superb.In&eacute;s Efron as Alex, and Ricardo Dar&iacute;n as her compassionate father Kraken, were both outstanding.

The movie is about Alex, an &#34;intersexed&#34; or hermaphoditic child of fourteen who does his/her own version of pulsing and floating in a formless void. It was filmed on what appears to be an isolated island off the coast of Argentina where Alex's parents have retreated in order to provide a safe environment for their sport of nature. Alex's mother leans towards a surgical intervention to make her definitively female; her father does not want to force the issue, preferring to let Alex decide. Alex alternates between boyishness, intense curiosity about boys, and a little girl's vulnerability. None of the characters, including a visiting plastic surgeon eager to reassign Alex's sex and an assortment of adolescent boys simultaneously fascinated and repelled by Alex's condition appear able to communicate with one another. This strikes me less as a reflection on Argentinean machismo as that they are all in the kind of international art house drama in which extreme personal alienation amounting to social mutism is de rigeur.

What can parents do to help their child choose his/her sex when that child has both?  When a person is born with both sexual organs, most parents decide the sex of the child shortly after birth.  But Alex's parents felt that is should be their child who should decide their sex.  Alex is raised as a girl.  But puberty is bringing some hard decision for Alex, her friends and family.  Shall Alex remain a girl and have an operation to remove her other organ?  This would be easier to answer is Alex knew her sexual preference.  She feels she is a boy but there is a fragility in her that is very obvious.  There is a moment in a film that I found heartbreaking.  Alex sits with her closest friends: high school girlfriend who is sexually active,intrigued and not frightened about Alex's body; Alex's best friend from the local schoool who was stunned to discover that Alex is not just an ordinary girl.  Alex's accidental lover, a slightly older boy who discovers after being with Alex that he is really gay - to the shock of his own parents.  The bravest decision Alex can make is to acknowledge publicly  what she is, not have any surgeries and let time show on who her live partner will be as the time goes by when she can sort out her own emotions.  This film is like no other film I have seen so far.

I'd watched it because someone had mentioned seeing it (a friend on Facebook) and she'd described it as ""disturbing.""  Living in PA, a relatively conservative area, I'm assuming now it was not a positive ""disturbing"" that she inferred.My take away on this film was it's beautiful simplicity.  I ache for the decisions and categorization that those who are not ""gender specific"" must go through.  It can not be easy.  But who are we to make these breathing, living, emotional people feel that they must categorize themselves? The girl, Alex whom this story is about summed it up perfectly ""maybe there is no choice.""  I'd like to know more about the background of this film, the actors, etc.  But taking it as a movie, I know there are many who have had to deal with this situation and it can't be easy.  Are we as society forcing them to deal with what they were born as/with?  Yes, to some extent we are.  But we must also realize that with both male and female traits and body aspects, comes hormonal signals that must be very difficult to deal with.  Knowing that you look like a girl on the outside, but act with agression at times due to the male aspects of yourself, yet being attracted to one particular sex or both, can not make it any easier.It is a two fold (society and self) anxiety that these folks must deal with (just as transgendered/transexual folks deal with).  Some don't have both sets of genitalia but their minds or bodies often do not agree with the physical representation that they present, male or female.  We as a society have a long way to go to accept people as they are.  Who are we to judge? We can not know what a person feels (unless it is ourself!).I love this film, the contrast of the simplicity of dialogue, the slow pace of the film with the extreme pain this character was experiencing.  The beautiful thing in this film was the undying support that her parents provided.  They had the option to have the situation surgically ""taken care of"" at Alex's birth, however they opted not to, the father stating that when Alex was born ""she was perfect.""",5,"Quietly Simple, Emotionally Complex",1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,2140,"[""'m"", 'still', 'reeling', 'watching', 'film', 'last', 'night', ""'d"", 'watched', 'someone', 'had', 'mentioned', 'seeing', 'friend', 'Facebook', ""'d"", 'described', 'disturbing', 'Living', 'PA', 'relatively', 'conservative', 'area', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'now', 'was', 'not', 'positive', 'disturbing', 'inferred.My', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'was', 'beautiful', 'simplicity', 'ache', 'decisions', 'categorization', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'gender', 'specific', 'must', 'go', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'who', 'are', 'make', 'breathing', 'living', 'emotional', 'people', 'feel', 'must', 'categorize', 'girl', 'Alex', 'whom', 'story', 'summed', 'up', 'perfectly', 'maybe', 'choice', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'more', 'background', 'film', 'actors', 'etc', 'taking', 'movie', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'deal', 'situation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'Are', 'society', 'forcing', 'deal', 'what', 'were', 'born', 'as/with', 'Yes', 'extent', 'are', 'must', 'also', 'realize', 'male', 'female', 'traits', 'body', 'aspects', 'hormonal', 'signals', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'deal', 'Knowing', 'look', 'girl', 'outside', 'act', 'agression', 'times', 'due', 'male', 'aspects', 'yet', 'being', 'attracted', 'one', 'particular', 'sex', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'easier.It', 'two', 'fold', 'society', 'self', 'anxiety', 'folks', 'must', 'deal', 'just', 'transgendered/transexual', 'folks', 'deal', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sets', 'genitalia', 'minds', 'bodies', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'physical', 'representation', 'present', 'male', 'female', 'society', 'have', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'accept', 'people', 'are', 'Who', 'are', 'judge', 'can', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'person', 'feels', '.I', 'love', 'film', 'contrast', 'simplicity', 'dialogue', 'slow', 'pace', 'film', 'extreme', 'pain', 'character', 'was', 'experiencing', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'undying', 'support', 'parents', 'provided', 'had', 'option', 'have', 'situation', 'surgically', 'taken', 'care', 'Alex', 'birth', 'however', 'opted', 'not', 'father', 'stating', 'when', 'Alex', 'was', 'born', 'was', 'perfect']",XXy
