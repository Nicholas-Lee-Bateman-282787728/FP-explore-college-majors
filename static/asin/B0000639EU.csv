Unfortunately, this one falls short.The translation from book to film doesn't quite synchronize, and the performances vary in quality. Some of the scenes come off as set-pieces lifted from the book. I found Ian Holm the standout as Cpl Himmelstoss. Pleasance is creditable as the school teacher. Borgnine seems over-animated at times, then wooden, as the veteran of the trenches imparting his wisdom to the young -- not an organic performance. Richard Thomas is able to LOOK the part of Paul Baumer, but the role seems mostly to escape him. He's too earnest and not relaxed enough to ""become"" Baumer.There are, however, a number of strengths in the film. The battle scenes are very well staged and the no man's land of the trenches is  convincing as a shell-shredded landscape, not to mention the muddy, rat-infested trenches themselves. The costuming evokes the period, as do the towns and railway stations of the Czechoslovakian Socialist Republic (standing in for France and Germany) -- no false building fronts here. One of my favorite scenes was the assembling of the troops in a town square for the awarding of Iron Crosses. The pan of the camera as the general arrives in his command car, preceded by cavalry and motorcycles established the event with credibility and a certain beauty -- and ironic gravitas.",3,"good set design, costumes -- acting uneven",1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,1366,"['are', 'need', 'up-to-date', 'treatment', 'AQWF', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'short.The', 'translation', 'book', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'synchronize', 'performances', 'vary', 'quality', 'scenes', 'come', 'off', 'set-pieces', 'lifted', 'book', 'found', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'standout', 'Cpl', 'Himmelstoss', 'Pleasance', 'creditable', 'school', 'teacher', 'Borgnine', 'over-animated', 'times', 'then', 'wooden', 'veteran', 'trenches', 'imparting', 'wisdom', 'young', 'not', 'organic', 'performance', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'able', 'LOOK', 'part', 'Paul', 'Baumer', 'role', 'mostly', 'escape', 'too', 'earnest', 'not', 'relaxed', 'enough', 'become', 'Baumer.There', 'are', 'however', 'number', 'strengths', 'film', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'staged', 'man', 'land', 'trenches', 'convincing', 'shell-shredded', 'landscape', 'not', 'mention', 'muddy', 'rat-infested', 'trenches', 'costuming', 'period', 'do', 'towns', 'railway', 'stations', 'Czechoslovakian', 'Socialist', 'Republic', 'standing', 'France', 'Germany', 'false', 'building', 'fronts', 'here', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'was', 'assembling', 'troops', 'town', 'square', 'awarding', 'Iron', 'Crosses', 'pan', 'camera', 'general', 'arrives', 'command', 'car', 'preceded', 'cavalry', 'motorcycles', 'established', 'event', 'credibility', 'certain', 'beauty', 'ironic', 'gravitas']",N/A

After seeing the 1979 picture, I've come to see how well made it was also. It's not right up there with the 1930 classic which I regarded to be one of the greatest movies made, but it certainly had merits. I really liked the story and how closely it resembled the original plot in the book. Probably the best feature of the remake was the use of color and how alive that came during the battles. There was a lot of touching scenes that seemed to prove the point in how war is unthinkable and wrong. I was surprised that it was made for television because I saw no indication of it.

694111,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0000639EU,C. B Collins Jr.,"[20, 23]","This film is really excellent, with a great cast, and a thoughtful and frightening message. We see the story of a group of high school boys graduating and then immediately joining the German army to fight in World War I.  The story revolves around Paul Baumer, a thoughtful and sensitive young man who gradually sees so many horrors of war, and loses so many of his friends, that he is transformed into a different person, a war-weary pessimist with no illusions, no dreams, no purpose, and no homeland.  Richard Thomas does a masterful job of playing Paul Baumer. He is supported with a fantanstic cast of actors.  Ernest Borgnine plays the peasant shoe maker who leads their platoon. He is an earthy fatherly survival focused man who does his best to ensure his men have food, rest, shelter, and take no outrageous risks of glory. Paul learns much from this man, who becomes a surrogate father and mentor. Ian Holm plays a military school drill instructor who is a sadist. Eventually his sadism goes too far and he is sent to the front lines where he exhibits cowardly actions that ironically result in his receiving a medal from the Kaiser. Patricia Neal plays Paul's dying mother. Paul has seen so much death that he is only able to show dispassionate empathy with his mother and tells her lies about the front lines so that she does not die of cancer worrying about her son. Donald Pleasance plays a high school instructor who fills the heads of young men on concepts of national glory, heroism, manhood, and other nonsense to which 18 year old boys fall victim.The oddessey of pain is carefully told as Paul experiences one loss and disillusionment after another. The tired eyes of the German infantry speak volumes as the Kaiser urges them on to give their lives for the fatherland. Paul's return home is a wonderful turn in the film as he finds that his father and the older fellows have no idea of the reality and horror of the war. They make simplistic overgeneralized comments such as 'the war will be won if we surround them' and other such nonsense. Paul's eyes glaze over as they discuss these abstractions while his young friends die in the muddy trenches. Paul's best friend, a gymnast and forrester, dies after a leg amputation. Paul tells his mother a story that her son died immediately and painlessless, which is far from the truth. She makes Paul swear by everything he holds sacred that this is the truth. He does so. Then she makes him swear by his own safe return home that this story is the truth. Again, he does so. In this extremely painful scene we see that Paul has beent totally transformed by the war. He no longer believes in anything but his ability to periodically protect himself and others against random and senseless violence and pain. He also realizes that he is no longer able to feel comfortable in his past or in the land of the living away from the war. He returns to the front lines fully expecting that the random nature of war may soon take him.Exceptionally well done, this is a film every family should see. It is only when peopel face the reality of war rather than the abstractions that war would ever end.",5,"Very well made, well acted, important message.",1142035200,"03 11, 2006",2006,3156,"['film', 'really', 'excellent', 'great', 'cast', 'thoughtful', 'frightening', 'message', 'see', 'story', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'boys', 'graduating', 'then', 'immediately', 'joining', 'German', 'army', 'fight', 'World', 'War', 'story', 'around', 'Paul', 'Baumer', 'thoughtful', 'sensitive', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'gradually', 'so', 'many', 'horrors', 'war', 'so', 'many', 'friends', 'transformed', 'different', 'person', 'war-weary', 'pessimist', 'illusions', 'dreams', 'purpose', 'homeland', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'masterful', 'job', 'playing', 'Paul', 'Baumer', 'supported', 'fantanstic', 'cast', 'actors', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'peasant', 'shoe', 'maker', 'who', 'platoon', 'earthy', 'fatherly', 'survival', 'focused', 'man', 'who', 'best', 'ensure', 'men', 'have', 'food', 'rest', 'shelter', 'take', 'outrageous', 'risks', 'glory', 'Paul', 'much', 'man', 'who', 'surrogate', 'father', 'mentor', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'military', 'school', 'drill', 'instructor', 'who', 'sadist', 'Eventually', 'sadism', 'too', 'far', 'sent', 'front', 'lines', 'where', 'cowardly', 'actions', 'ironically', 'result', 'receiving', 'medal', 'Kaiser', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'Paul', 'dying', 'mother', 'Paul', 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'death', 'only', 'able', 'show', 'dispassionate', 'empathy', 'mother', 'lies', 'front', 'lines', 'not', 'die', 'cancer', 'worrying', 'son', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'high', 'school', 'instructor', 'who', 'heads', 'young', 'men', 'concepts', 'national', 'glory', 'heroism', 'manhood', 'other', 'nonsense', '18', 'year', 'old', 'fall', 'victim.The', 'oddessey', 'pain', 'carefully', 'told', 'Paul', 'one', 'loss', 'disillusionment', 'tired', 'eyes', 'German', 'infantry', 'speak', 'volumes', 'Kaiser', 'give', 'lives', 'fatherland', 'Paul', 'return', 'home', 'wonderful', 'turn', 'film', 'father', 'older', 'fellows', 'have', 'idea', 'reality', 'horror', 'war', 'make', 'simplistic', 'overgeneralized', 'comments', 'such', ""'the"", 'war', 'will', 'be', 'won', 'surround', 'other', 'such', 'nonsense', 'Paul', 'eyes', 'glaze', 'over', 'discuss', 'abstractions', 'young', 'friends', 'die', 'muddy', 'trenches', 'Paul', 'best', 'friend', 'gymnast', 'forrester', 'dies', 'leg', 'amputation', 'Paul', 'mother', 'story', 'son', 'died', 'immediately', 'painlessless', 'far', 'truth', 'Paul', 'swear', 'everything', 'sacred', 'truth', 'so', 'Then', 'swear', 'own', 'safe', 'return', 'home', 'story', 'truth', 'Again', 'so', 'extremely', 'painful', 'scene', 'see', 'Paul', 'beent', 'totally', 'transformed', 'war', 'no', 'longer', 'anything', 'ability', 'periodically', 'protect', 'others', 'random', 'senseless', 'violence', 'pain', 'also', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'past', 'land', 'living', 'away', 'war', 'front', 'lines', 'fully', 'expecting', 'random', 'nature', 'war', 'may', 'soon', 'take', 'him.Exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'family', 'should', 'see', 'only', 'when', 'peopel', 'face', 'reality', 'war', 'rather', 'abstractions', 'war', 'would', 'ever', 'end']",N/A

Uniforms are correct, and it follows the book plotline pretty well.It doesn't get the critical reviews that the 1930s film does, but I think that may be due to the wide acclaim that old classic has - and maybe due to some effects like the 1979 version being in color whilst the book never mentions colors - in fact, one can almost feel that era was all gray or black & white (and the 1939 film follows that theme, by necessity).I think this film should be better known than it is, especially with some of the re-newed interest in the Great War after so long being overshadowed by WW2 and Vietnam...but understand, the book is not a happy one - its about hopelessness.

694116,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B0000639EU,Graves,"[2, 2]","In the late 1970's Richard Thomas and a production company went to Yugoslavia to make one of the most accurate portrayals of Remarque's Brilliant book All Quiet on the Western Front.The book follows the adventures of Paul Baumer, an adventuresome young man who, along with his classmates on their graduation day join up for the army to go fight the French. Through adventures, laughter and horror the myth of the `grand adventure' slips away and Paul grows up, going from the young kid to the experienced vet who can keep an eye on the new boys and maybe they'll make it.Although famously the subject one of the best early films, this remake was true to the book's plot points in amazing detail. Add to that the attention to detail on the weapons, uniforms and the set was an actually period correct town being demolished by the government for a housing development so when you see a house blow up, It isn't f/x or CGI, they really did blow it up.Arguably this was when it came out, one of the best films on the First World War ever made. So why only 3 stars? Because this isn't that film! The original film was a little over 3 hours long. To make it fit onto a standard 2 hour VHS tape it was edited to pieces taking out all the fascinating plot points of human development. As an example of this, when Paul gets back from leave one of the men declares ""He said I could have them"" and they all look at his boots. In the edited film this means nothing because they cut out the human interest of earlier scenes as these expensive high quality boots, privately bought, are passed between friends when the old owner has no use for them. In saying ""He said I could have them"" the friend is telling Paul that while he was away, another buddy has died, but the film, edited to death besides the boot's last owner, this scene has no meaning.If you never read the book or saw this in its original format, you'll love it, but if like me, you saw the original, this will only leave you wondering how on earth someone could butcher such a wonderful film.

694124,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,B0000639EU,Octavius,"[33, 34]","'War devours everything' is the general theme of this more recent adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's famous novel. Directed by Delbert Mann, the film satisfies on many levels with a very good script; good cinematography and direction; and, the good acting talents of Richard Thomas, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasance, and Ian Holm. The story is a first-person narrative detailing the life of its author, Paul Baumer (Richard Thomas), during the period of The Great War from 1916-1918.  Baumer just graduated from high school and, like every other good German, he signs up for the war along with his classmates to serve his Fatherland: it is the ideal that has been pounded into them by their school teacher (Donald Pleasance.)  At first all gleaming with overconfidence, the narrator and his friends soon realize that there's no glory in war even if one has dutifuly served the Fatherland and received an Iron Cross pinned to their chest by the Kaiser himself.As with the book, the narrative uses the characters to show how the reality of war, in one way or another, destroys or changes the ideals of life: it is rich in showing the futility and beastiality of war.  The film really looks at the two main schools of thought that were a product of WWI; positivists such as Bertrand Russel who thought that modern progress was a positive factor to humanity if guided by moral values and, the school of nihilism that thought morality was relative and human existence purposeless: that modern industrialization was not a sign of progress but the beginning of the end.  Baumer and his friends are, at first, the voices of the positivists: despite the war, they're all still obsessed with their dreams of becoming artists/writers, theologists, farmers, and foresters.  Their  sergeant (Ernest Borgnine) is the sobering pragmatist who teaches the youths to dispense with idealism and to bear only the brutal reality of war in their thoughts: he teaches them the practical skills of finding good food and to survive by using their shovels to kill the enemy instead of the bayonet.  Slowly but surely, each of the narrator's friends become victims of the war despite their idealism: some of them are killed precisely because of their idealism.  In short, the narrative subtly explores every possible facet of war in how it permanently destroys, disfigures, or otherwise changes life and the human spirit: it explores the utter futility and dehumanization of war.  Although one follows Baumer's optimism throughout the story, one realizes that optimism ultimately changes nothing in terms of the reality of war: only one's perception of it. The story actually leaves the question open as to whether an optimistic outlook serves any purpose at all in either war or peace. The film also shows the growing gap between the young soldiers and the elder generations who still saw war in the context of the 19th century: as a glorious and heroic duty/sacrifice to the State. In contrast, the youths are ages apart as they've experienced first hand the horror and desolation of modern warfare which their elders cannot possibly understand (e.g. machine guns, planes, mustard gas, etc.)This is an excellent film that has great direction, cinematography, and acting that is far above the standards of a made-for-tv film.  The filming in the Czech Republic is always a good place for German/Austrian related films (i.e. Amadeus.)  The script was well done to bring out the poignant themes in the book.  There are some inaccuracies and limitations in its depiction of the military and equipment during that time but a lot of it is budget related as opposed to being signs of incompetence (i.e. no artillery is shown, few aircraft, no tanks, etc.)  With the way the soldiers are constantly placing their rifles muzzle first into the mud in every scene, it makes you wonder whether it was the script's soldiers or the actors who received such incompetent training in handling a firearm in battle.  There's also a scene where a corporal badmouths a sergeant and everyone seems to think it's normal.  Anyway, these are simply minor defects that have no major impact on the film.  I strongly recommend it as the only other version, although a classic film, is black and white and over 70 years old.  Good companions to this film would be 'The Lost Batallion', 'Gallipoli', and 'The Blue Max' which all deal with WWI.  In terms of theme, a good counterpoint to this film is 'Cross of Iron' which is also a great film in exploring the futility/absurdity of war except that it is set in WWII from the German perspective.  Unlike this film, 'Cross of Iron' is grounded in a nihilistic theme that rejects the notion of idealism having any use either in warfare or life in general: making the theme perhaps even bleaker than this one.",5,Bellum Omni Vorat,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,4803,"['devours', 'everything', 'general', 'theme', 'more', 'recent', 'adaptation', 'Erich', 'Maria', 'Remarque', 'famous', 'novel', 'Directed', 'Delbert', 'Mann', 'film', 'satisfies', 'many', 'levels', 'very', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'cinematography', 'direction', 'good', 'acting', 'talents', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'story', 'first-person', 'narrative', 'detailing', 'life', 'author', 'Paul', 'Baumer', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'period', 'Great', 'War', '1916-1918', 'Baumer', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'other', 'good', 'German', 'signs', 'up', 'war', 'classmates', 'serve', 'Fatherland', 'ideal', 'been', 'pounded', 'school', 'teacher', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'first', 'gleaming', 'overconfidence', 'narrator', 'friends', 'soon', 'realize', 'glory', 'war', 'even', 'one', 'dutifuly', 'served', 'Fatherland', 'received', 'Iron', 'Cross', 'pinned', 'chest', 'Kaiser', 'himself.As', 'book', 'narrative', 'characters', 'show', 'how', 'reality', 'war', 'one', 'way', 'ideals', 'life', 'rich', 'showing', 'futility', 'beastiality', 'war', 'film', 'really', 'two', 'main', 'schools', 'thought', 'were', 'product', 'WWI', 'positivists', 'such', 'Bertrand', 'Russel', 'who', 'thought', 'modern', 'progress', 'was', 'positive', 'factor', 'humanity', 'guided', 'moral', 'values', 'school', 'nihilism', 'thought', 'morality', 'was', 'relative', 'human', 'existence', 'purposeless', 'modern', 'industrialization', 'was', 'not', 'sign', 'progress', 'beginning', 'end', 'Baumer', 'friends', 'are', 'first', 'voices', 'positivists', 'war', ""'re"", 'still', 'obsessed', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'artists/writers', 'theologists', 'farmers', 'foresters', 'sergeant', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'sobering', 'pragmatist', 'who', 'youths', 'dispense', 'idealism', 'bear', 'only', 'brutal', 'reality', 'war', 'thoughts', 'practical', 'skills', 'finding', 'good', 'food', 'survive', 'using', 'shovels', 'kill', 'enemy', 'instead', 'bayonet', 'Slowly', 'surely', 'narrator', 'friends', 'become', 'victims', 'war', 'idealism', 'are', 'killed', 'precisely', 'idealism', 'short', 'narrative', 'subtly', 'possible', 'facet', 'war', 'how', 'permanently', 'disfigures', 'otherwise', 'changes', 'life', 'human', 'spirit', 'utter', 'futility', 'dehumanization', 'war', 'one', 'Baumer', 'optimism', 'story', 'one', 'optimism', 'ultimately', 'nothing', 'terms', 'reality', 'war', 'only', 'one', 'perception', 'story', 'actually', 'question', 'open', 'optimistic', 'outlook', 'purpose', 'war', 'peace', 'film', 'also', 'growing', 'gap', 'young', 'soldiers', 'elder', 'generations', 'who', 'still', 'saw', 'war', 'context', '19th', 'century', 'glorious', 'heroic', 'duty/sacrifice', 'State', 'contrast', 'youths', 'are', 'ages', 'apart', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'first', 'hand', 'horror', 'desolation', 'modern', 'warfare', 'elders', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'understand', 'e.g', 'machine', 'guns', 'planes', 'mustard', 'gas', 'etc', 'excellent', 'film', 'great', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'far', 'standards', 'made-for-tv', 'film', 'filming', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'always', 'good', 'place', 'German/Austrian', 'related', 'films', 'i.e', 'Amadeus', 'script', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'bring', 'out', 'poignant', 'themes', 'book', 'are', 'inaccuracies', 'limitations', 'depiction', 'military', 'equipment', 'time', 'lot', 'budget', 'related', 'opposed', 'being', 'signs', 'incompetence', 'i.e', 'artillery', 'shown', 'few', 'aircraft', 'tanks', 'etc', 'way', 'soldiers', 'are', 'constantly', 'placing', 'rifles', 'muzzle', 'first', 'mud', 'scene', 'wonder', 'was', 'script', 'soldiers', 'actors', 'who', 'received', 'such', 'incompetent', 'training', 'handling', 'firearm', 'battle', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'corporal', 'badmouths', 'sergeant', 'everyone', 'think', 'normal', 'Anyway', 'are', 'simply', 'minor', 'defects', 'have', 'major', 'impact', 'film', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'only', 'other', 'version', 'classic', 'film', 'black', 'white', '70', 'years', 'old', 'Good', 'companions', 'film', 'would', 'be', ""'The"", 'Lost', 'Batallion', ""'Gallipoli"", 'Blue', 'Max', 'deal', 'WWI', 'terms', 'theme', 'good', 'counterpoint', 'film', ""'Cross"", 'Iron', 'also', 'great', 'film', 'exploring', 'futility/absurdity', 'war', 'set', 'WWII', 'German', 'perspective', 'film', ""'Cross"", 'Iron', 'grounded', 'nihilistic', 'theme', 'notion', 'idealism', 'having', 'use', 'warfare', 'life', 'general', 'making', 'theme', 'perhaps', 'even', 'bleaker', 'one']",N/A

Both Richard Thomas and Ernest Borgnine give compelling performances. The war scenes, right down to the rifle stocks, are surprisingly realistic, with the exception of some of the artillery explosions.For me though, this review is less about this film as a production than it is a critique of the underlying story. I have always been interested in the story, but I think I was afraid it might depress me, so I stayed away from it. However, having achieved a measure of understanding of WWI, I finally felt I was prepared to see how this film would stack up against what I've learned. Not well, I'm afraid.Granted, the author of the literary work ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was a veteran of WWI and it is hard to argue with experience, but it is also true he only served near the front lines for about 5 weeks before he was wounded by shrapnel and exited the war - very unlike his primary protagonist, Paul, who served much, much longer.It is a very simple thing to underscore the alleged futility of war if one avoids all examinations of causes. In fact, the outbreak WWI was all but inevitable, like the Titanic disaster just five years prior. In 1917 the western world was in the midst of unprecedented upheaval brought on by rapid transformation of society from slow paced agrarian, to high paced mechanization. These were heady times and western man was abounding with an unprecedented sense of impressive new vistas for mankind. The same blind ego that sank the Titanic convinced major powers of that era that the newly equipped, untested, mechanized armies they were developing would be capable of overcoming any obstacle. Ernest Hemingway, who also served in WWI, is a prime example of the kind of men this age produced. A barreled-chest and a willingness to face the charge, gun in hand, of a cornered bull elephant were characteristics men admired in this age. This age also gave us Teddy Roosevelt, and the uncompromising Woodrow Wilson, who only compromised (with France) in the end after God weakened his resolve, and addled his brain, through an encounter with the horrific Spanish Influenza.Yes, war fought to exercise the ambitions of vainglorious men is futile (the point of this movie), but the first world war happened because vainglorious ambition was the predominant ethos of the age. It is futile to die of drowning in the North Atlantic adrift from an ""unsinkable"" ship but restraining the folly of men is like trying to restrain the wind.All Quiet on the Western Front characterizes war a futile but fails to get at the root causes of the futility. Moreover, there are plenty of causes worth dying for.

Originally made for American television as one of a slew of superior adaptations of classic novels by producer Norman Rosemont that also included The Man in the Iron Mask, The Count of Monte Cristo, Oliver Twist and A Christmas Carol, this earned a theatrical release outside the US and certainly stood up admirably on the bigger screen.Unlike the 1931 version, this version follows the flashback structure of Remarque's novel much more closely and provides a slightly different ending (because it was a new adaptation of the novel rather than a remake of the Universal film, they couldn't use the butterfly ending invented for the 1930 film), but still retains much of its power. The cast is starrier but good - Richard Thomas, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasance, Patricia Neal and Ian Holm are all memorable - the attack sequences are well staged and the ugliness and daily horrors of life in rat-infested trenches are portrayed with more discomforting realism than you'd expect for 70s US TV.
