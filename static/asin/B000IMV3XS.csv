This was officially the first time American women served in a combat area where they could also be wounded or killed. They served, they treated and they provided for the wounded and the dying - not an easy challenge for the most hardened combat vet. Women in combat, especially these very brave women in Viet Nam, deserve all the credit they receive and more. There are many veterans today who give credit to their survival, not to the doctors, but to the American nurses who took care of them.Semper Fi, nurses. You deserve much more than you received from that war.",5,Salute to Combat Nurses,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,855,"['surviving', 'combat', 'Marine', 'Grunt', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'war', 'want', 'laud', 'movie', 'very', 'real', 'part', 'American', 'nurses', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'played', 'support', 'not', 'war', 'soldiers', 'Marines', 'who', 'were', 'wounded', 'med-evaced', 'aid', 'station', 'surgical', 'unit', 'hospital', 'ship', 'was', 'officially', 'first', 'time', 'American', 'women', 'served', 'combat', 'area', 'where', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'wounded', 'killed', 'served', 'treated', 'provided', 'wounded', 'dying', 'not', 'easy', 'challenge', 'most', 'hardened', 'combat', 'vet', 'Women', 'combat', 'especially', 'very', 'brave', 'women', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'deserve', 'credit', 'receive', 'more', 'are', 'many', 'veterans', 'today', 'who', 'give', 'credit', 'survival', 'not', 'doctors', 'American', 'nurses', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'them.Semper', 'Fi', 'deserve', 'much', 'more', 'received', 'war']",Vietnam Nurses with Dana Delany

They speak to the anguish of having a young man die under their care and while I acknowledge their pain, it all became a bit boring after only a few minutes.  Very little mention was made of the men in the field who experienced the very same things as the nurses but while at the same time were being shot at, fought in the rain and mud and heat and dust, slept on the ground, and had C-rations for days on end.  I realize this was about the nurses, but they were not the ones who had it the most difficult and it would have helped had they acknowledged that.  When the nurses started talking about the parties they had and the music they played, I turned it off.  I had all I could take.  I was one of those guys fighting the war who did not sleep in a clean bed each night, who did not get a shower each day, who did not go to the messhall for meals, and who did not go to frequent parties.

I watched every episode till they were no more.  I will re- watch it again. VIETNAM NURSES is about the women who were portrayed through out China Beach as their nurses.  So many nurses were there caring for our boys in viet nam and did such a man filled job as far as Doctoring and trying so hard to keep them a live,with their  bravery and gutting up. I was never more proud as a woman then I was watching China Beach. Then I saw Dana Delany ,was hosting this documentry and I knew I wanted to own it and watch it.  Dana Delany won a Emmey for this show You will not be disappointed. Like China Beach (and Platoon which I saw at the show when it first came out,there will be tears, a lot of tears.

1021377,A1MG78N06W1BZU,B000IMV3XS,Murrell R. Morgan,"[10, 10]","This is a poignant and powerful film that resonates with truth that needed to be told. War forever changes all those who took part and these very brave young women, raised with the myths of the 1950's early 60's US culture were stepping into a crucible of revolutionary cultural change and chaotic violence. How they dealt with these pressures along with numerous 24 hour non stop shifts of unending carnage is a tribute to their courage and resilience. The most moving part of this film, which is short 45 min-but not one minute is wasted, was when  Diane Carlson Evans, the Vietnam Nurse who spearheaded the drive to have a monument in Washington DC honoring the nurses who served in Vietnam, recalled how she had been raised in hte Lutheran faith, and a while after she returned from Vietnam, someone from the Lutheran Church contacted her and wanted to interview her, and she said"" I'm not the person you want. I prayed every day I was in Vietnam for the war to stop and the killing and maiming to stop and it did not. So God is dead.The interviewer remarked that maybe God was in Vietnam through the empathy and love and care shown by nurses like herself during the insanity of war.
