It is the ONLY DVD of a movie or of a TV program where they bleep words you can see the actors form with their mouths both on the tv program and on the DVD.  VERY STRANGENow they are taking this 13 episode Season 3 and making 2 DVD sets out of it?  UNBELIEVABLE!No wonder the sales for DVDs are going down.  Just a few years ago DVDs were full of extras including booklets.  Now you are lucky if you get a working disc with  front and back art work.Oh, and I forgot to mention that this 1/2 episodes of Season 3 (6 or 7 episodes) costs MORE that the 12 episodes of Season 1 or Season 2.MORE UNBELIEVABLE!!!!",1,WHO is going to buy a 1/2 season of a 22 minute show????,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,673,"['enjoy', 'show', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'ONLY', 'DVD', 'movie', 'TV', 'program', 'where', 'bleep', 'words', 'can', 'see', 'actors', 'form', 'mouths', 'tv', 'program', 'DVD', 'VERY', 'are', 'taking', '13', 'episode', 'Season', '3', 'making', '2', 'DVD', 'sets', 'UNBELIEVABLE', 'wonder', 'sales', 'DVDs', 'are', 'going', 'down', 'Just', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'DVDs', 'were', 'full', 'extras', 'including', 'booklets', 'Now', 'are', 'lucky', 'get', 'working', 'disc', 'front', 'back', 'art', 'work.Oh', 'forgot', 'mention', '1/2', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', '6', '7', 'episodes', 'MORE', '12', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '2.MORE', 'UNBELIEVABLE']","Awkward: Season 3, Part 1"

I was looking forward to seeing Jenna get caught up in many incidents, which didn't happen. Also, Sadie didn't deliver many laughs. This season was more serious/dramatic. I still love the show and will continue watching Season 3 Part 2 in the fall!",4,MatthewCross,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,324,"['show', 'changed', 'even', 'slogan', 'season', 'change', 'blows', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Jenna', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'many', 'incidents', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Also', 'Sadie', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'many', 'laughs', 'season', 'was', 'more', 'serious/dramatic', 'still', 'love', 'show', 'will', 'continue', 'watching', 'Season', '3', 'Part', '2', 'fall']","Awkward: Season 3, Part 1"

It's a great way for them to make more money offDVD sell, looks like MTV is making a habit of this like with Teen Wolf.  But with a show like this they know it will stillSell!!! This season finds Jenna figuring herself  and her relationships out, and rebellion seems to be on her herizon!!It's about time Jenna loosened up, but she takes it too far and regrets come quick ly to her, leaving her with  no friendsOr family to lean on!! Hazards of a teenager for sure!!!All ends as it should. Lessons are learned. Can't wait for season 4, with a part 1 I bet!!",5,Awkward,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,626,"['love', 'show', 'hate', 'when', 'do', 'part', '1', '2', 'stuff', 'great', 'way', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'offDVD', 'sell', 'MTV', 'making', 'habit', 'like', 'Teen', 'Wolf', 'show', 'know', 'will', 'stillSell', 'season', 'Jenna', 'figuring', 'relationships', 'out', 'rebellion', 'be', 'herizon', 'time', 'Jenna', 'loosened', 'up', 'too', 'far', 'come', 'quick', 'ly', 'leaving', 'friendsOr', 'family', 'lean', 'Hazards', 'teenager', 'sure', 'should', 'Lessons', 'are', 'learned', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '4', 'part', '1', 'bet']","Awkward: Season 3, Part 1"
