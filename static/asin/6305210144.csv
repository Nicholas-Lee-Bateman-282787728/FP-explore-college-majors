454572,A272G1285GP5QO,6305210144,Ary Luiz Dalazen Jr.,"[3, 5]","During the seventies, the 54 studio was the most famous, celebrated and disputed disco around in New York. It was the house of the polemic Steve Rubell, a man willing to satisfy his rich customers' desiree, influential  people such as Gore Vidal and Princess Grace. 54 , an original and  interesting drama, is almost a documentary of the hot and sensual nights  placed inside the club,but it also narrates Shane's saga, a youth who sees  in the disco the chance of a life time in stablishing himself as a  respectable and powerful person, and the plot narrates the ascension and  the decadence of Shane, Rubell, the 54 and of the seventies fever. Very  similar to Boogie Nights (although inferior), this drama delivers great  surprises,  like Mike Meyers's dramatic and talented performance,  unrecognizable as the homosexual and crazed Rubell. With strong moments  and, per times, explicit and shocking scenes, the filmmaker Mark  Christopher demonstrates courage and daring in his craft. Christopher knows  that the basic elements of the story are dangerous and may mean the film's  failure(drugs, sex) but, instead of attenuating the explosive issues, he  explores them in a realistic and direct way, and this is evident in  memorable minutes (Ryan Phillippe and Sela Ward have the most difficult  part) . For those who want to see a vigorous drama about the violence, the  madness, the pleasures and the drugs that marked the seventies, 54 is a  great option. For those who just want to have a good time with a lineal and  pleasant film, 54 is also a good choice!",4,"An interesting drama, with strong supporting performances",944611200,"12 8, 1999",1999,1567,"['seventies', '54', 'studio', 'was', 'most', 'famous', 'celebrated', 'disputed', 'disco', 'around', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'house', 'polemic', 'Steve', 'Rubell', 'man', 'willing', 'satisfy', 'rich', 'customers', 'desiree', 'influential', 'people', 'such', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'Princess', 'Grace', '54', 'original', 'interesting', 'drama', 'almost', 'documentary', 'hot', 'sensual', 'nights', 'placed', 'club', 'also', 'Shane', 'saga', 'youth', 'who', 'disco', 'chance', 'life', 'time', 'stablishing', 'respectable', 'powerful', 'person', 'plot', 'ascension', 'decadence', 'Shane', 'Rubell', '54', 'seventies', 'fever', 'Very', 'similar', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'inferior', 'drama', 'great', 'surprises', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'dramatic', 'talented', 'performance', 'unrecognizable', 'homosexual', 'crazed', 'Rubell', 'strong', 'moments', 'times', 'explicit', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'filmmaker', 'Mark', 'Christopher', 'courage', 'daring', 'craft', 'Christopher', 'basic', 'elements', 'story', 'are', 'dangerous', 'may', 'mean', 'film', 'failure', 'drugs', 'sex', 'instead', 'attenuating', 'explosive', 'issues', 'realistic', 'direct', 'way', 'evident', 'memorable', 'minutes', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'have', 'most', 'difficult', 'part', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'vigorous', 'drama', 'violence', 'madness', 'pleasures', 'drugs', 'marked', 'seventies', '54', 'great', 'option', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'lineal', 'pleasant', 'film', '54', 'also', 'good', 'choice']",54 VHS

From start to finish, I am quite amazed how 54 had no plot to speak of along with horrible set of undeveloped characters. As many films as I've seen Ryan Phillippe star in, it is becoming quite apparent that it's just too darned impossible to cure him of bad acting. He may be good looking, but that boy has no acting ability of any kind. I just wonder to myself if I can do it better than he can, or I just wonder how did he become allowed to act in Hollywood movies. The sheer sight of him trying to act is incredible. It is like an undoing of everything that Marlon Brando had created. When the plot is basically nonexistent, there isn't much to talk about 54. On the other hand, Mike Myers takes a detour in his career to do a dramatic role for 54. I must say, I think what he did was so-so despite the fact that he showed an extremely limited range. It would have been much nicer if 54 was more focused on Steve Rubell instead of the rubbish I saw. Had that happened, Mike Myers would have shot himself into the front of the race for Best Actor of the Year. Potential was written all over this one. As much as it pains me to say this, Boogie Nights is better than 54. All in all, 54 has the impression of looking at a picture that's got lots of colors but no definite meaning out of them. In other words, if you want watch the ruler of dance club films, get Saturday Night Fever and be mesmerized by John Travolta, the disco king of Brooklyn.",1,Utterly Crap.,1316736000,"09 23, 2011",2011,1550,"['Viewed', '2/08Rate', '22/08', 'Imagine', 'reaction', 'when', 'saw', '54', 'movie', 'utterly', 'stupid', 'pointless', 'start', 'finish', 'am', 'quite', 'amazed', 'how', '54', 'had', 'plot', 'speak', 'along', 'horrible', 'set', 'undeveloped', 'characters', 'many', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'star', 'becoming', 'quite', 'apparent', 'just', 'too', 'darned', 'impossible', 'cure', 'bad', 'acting', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'looking', 'boy', 'acting', 'ability', 'kind', 'just', 'wonder', 'myself', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'can', 'just', 'wonder', 'how', 'did', 'become', 'allowed', 'act', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'sheer', 'sight', 'trying', 'act', 'incredible', 'undoing', 'everything', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'had', 'created', 'When', 'plot', 'basically', 'nonexistent', ""n't"", 'much', 'talk', '54', 'other', 'hand', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'detour', 'career', 'do', 'dramatic', 'role', '54', 'must', 'say', 'think', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'so-so', 'fact', 'showed', 'extremely', 'limited', 'range', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'nicer', '54', 'was', 'more', 'focused', 'Steve', 'Rubell', 'instead', 'rubbish', 'saw', 'Had', 'happened', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'would', 'have', 'shot', 'front', 'race', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Year', 'Potential', 'was', 'written', 'one', 'As', 'much', 'say', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'better', '54', '54', 'impression', 'looking', 'picture', 'got', 'lots', 'colors', 'definite', 'meaning', 'other', 'words', 'want', 'watch', 'ruler', 'dance', 'club', 'films', 'get', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'John', 'Travolta', 'disco', 'king', 'Brooklyn']",54 VHS

454577,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6305210144,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","This film is a morality tale of a young man dazzled by the bright lights of the big city. Ryan Phillippe does a credible job playing young Shane O'Shea, a gas station attendant from New Jersey who becomes a boy-toy bartender in Studio 54 in the 1970s. Young Shane is allowed into the club and then hired as an employee by Steve Rubell, played by Mike Myers. Myers offers the best acting in the film as he plays the outrageous Rubell. Drugs and alcohol are rampant in this exclusive nightclub for the stars , millionaires, models, and other folks in the New York and International jet set. Salma Hayek plays Anita the coat check girl who becomes a disco diva while her husband Greg, played by Breckin Meyer, struggles as a busboy in the club. This married couple takes young Shane into their apartment as a house-mate but this was not a match made in heaven. Tensions develop since Shane and Greg are competing to move up from busboy to bartender. Sexual tensions also develop between Shane and Anita. Shane moves up quick in the chaos of the club becoming the lover of a record producer, played very well by Sela Ward. Sela Ward's acting is excellent as she plays the older woman who is using a younger man for his sexual energy and physical beauty. This is a nice twist on the theme of the older successful man seducing and supporting a younger woman. The character played by Ward, Billie Auster, is sophisticated and worldly and has very low expectations. She just settles for money and sex in her life. There is a scene in the film where Shane is making love to Billie Auster and Billie passes out from drugs while they are having intercourse. Shane continues to move inside her and he catches a look at himself in a mirror, full length nude on top of her, being confronted with what he has become. Shane's fantasy however is soap-opera star Julie Black, played by Neve Campbell, a New Jersey actress who has made it big in Shane's eyes. Enough said about the plot since it is in the end an old fashioned story of young man loses and then finds himself. One fun aspect of the film is to spot all the famous folks who appear in the film either as extras or as offering one or two lines. This includes Thelma Houston, Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Hutton, Michael York, Cheryl Crow, Cindy Crawford, Heidi Klum, Donald Trump, Art Garfunkel, Valerie Perrine, Michael Pitt, and Lorna Luft.",4,Boy-toy gets lost and then gets found,1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,2378,"['film', 'morality', 'tale', 'young', 'man', 'dazzled', 'bright', 'lights', 'big', 'city', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'credible', 'job', 'playing', 'young', 'Shane', ""O'Shea"", 'gas', 'station', 'attendant', 'New', 'Jersey', 'who', 'boy-toy', 'bartender', 'Studio', '54', '1970s', 'Young', 'Shane', 'allowed', 'club', 'then', 'hired', 'employee', 'Steve', 'Rubell', 'played', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'Myers', 'best', 'acting', 'film', 'outrageous', 'Rubell', 'Drugs', 'alcohol', 'are', 'rampant', 'exclusive', 'nightclub', 'stars', 'millionaires', 'models', 'other', 'folks', 'New', 'York', 'International', 'jet', 'set', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Anita', 'coat', 'check', 'girl', 'who', 'disco', 'diva', 'husband', 'Greg', 'played', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'busboy', 'club', 'married', 'couple', 'young', 'Shane', 'apartment', 'house-mate', 'was', 'not', 'match', 'made', 'heaven', 'Tensions', 'develop', 'Shane', 'Greg', 'are', 'competing', 'move', 'up', 'busboy', 'bartender', 'Sexual', 'tensions', 'also', 'develop', 'Shane', 'Anita', 'Shane', 'up', 'quick', 'chaos', 'club', 'becoming', 'lover', 'record', 'producer', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'acting', 'excellent', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'using', 'younger', 'man', 'sexual', 'energy', 'physical', 'beauty', 'nice', 'twist', 'theme', 'older', 'successful', 'man', 'seducing', 'supporting', 'younger', 'woman', 'character', 'played', 'Ward', 'Billie', 'Auster', 'sophisticated', 'worldly', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'just', 'settles', 'money', 'sex', 'life', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'Shane', 'making', 'love', 'Billie', 'Auster', 'Billie', 'out', 'drugs', 'are', 'having', 'intercourse', 'Shane', 'move', 'look', 'mirror', 'full', 'length', 'nude', 'top', 'being', 'confronted', 'what', 'become', 'Shane', 'fantasy', 'however', 'soap-opera', 'star', 'Julie', 'Black', 'played', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'New', 'Jersey', 'actress', 'who', 'made', 'big', 'Shane', 'eyes', 'Enough', 'said', 'plot', 'end', 'old', 'fashioned', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'then', 'One', 'fun', 'aspect', 'film', 'spot', 'famous', 'folks', 'who', 'appear', 'film', 'extras', 'offering', 'one', 'two', 'lines', 'Thelma', 'Houston', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'Michael', 'York', 'Cheryl', 'Crow', 'Cindy', 'Crawford', 'Heidi', 'Klum', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Lorna', 'Luft']",54 VHS
454578,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6305210144,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[3, 3]","Some may see 54 as a cautionary tale, others as a how-to manual--I see it as a mixture of both. The late 70's early 80's were an extraordinary time. On the one hand there was recession, gas shortages, the Iran hostage situation, the Lennon assassination, horrible fashion, and disco; on the other hand there was sex, drugs, and disco. It was the best of times; it was the tackiest of times. Before AIDS, before people knew that coke just made you even more of a jerk than you were already, before people realized that leisure suits looked ridiculous, and mullets and perms were the devil's haircut; it looked like the party would never end. When we woke up it was either the big chill, or the big hangover. What were we thinking? Still, this film is really an important historical document that sums up the zeitgeist of those turbulent days of disco inferno.Studio 54 proprietor Steve Rubell (Mike Meyers) is both crass and sensitive. He wants the party to last forever, but you'll only get in if you are beautiful, powerful, rich, a celebrity, or some combination of the above. Mike Meyers acts his pants off in a rare dramatic role. Though at times his version of Rubell shows flashes of Austin Powers, and even Dr. Evil, he mostly plays him straight. Or as straight as you can play someone who uses the bartenders and bus boys of Studio 54 as his own personal male harem.54 is similar to 24 Hour Party People, centering on the scene around a night club, but in 24 Hour PP the club is in Manchester, not Manhattan. 54 is also different in that rather than focusing on the impresario the story is told through the eyes of an outsider who starts as a busboy then becomes a star bartender, Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe). His character is based on Tieg Thomas who worked at Studio 54 from 1977 to 1982. Shane is a New Jersey boy who dreams of the night life just over the bridge when he sees a picture of Julie Black (Neve Campbell), a New Jersey girl who acts in a soap opera, in the gossip column. He has the looks that get him in, even though his Jersey friends can't get in, even when he becomes a star bartender and begs Steve to put them on the list.The most poignant scene in my opinion is when the newly hired Shane moves to New York. He walks down the dreary stairs of his New Jersey home while his father just sits there glumly and says good-bye.Shane moves in with a couple who both work at 54, Greg & Anita Randazzo (Breckin Meyer and Salma Hayek). Greg is a busboy like Shane, but he is unwilling to do what it takes to get ahead and be promoted to bartender. Anita is a coat check girl, but she has disco dreams of her own. Salma Hayek is smokin' hot, and she even does get to finally sing, quite well, I might add. Though 54 is not so much a film with Hollywood endings as an elegy for a bygone era, those halcyon days that did not end so well...I think that Ryan Phillippe did a great job here, the best I've seen him since he played Sebastian Valmont in Cruel Intentions. Neve Campbell does well as Shane's love interest. A couple of kids from New Jersey, they go bowling, and could almost end up living happily ever after if they hadn't both sold their souls to the demons who preside over Studio 54.There are tons of celebrity cameos: Michael York plays an ambassador, Ron Jeremy plays Ron, Elio Fiorucci plays himself, and we have Cindy Crawford, Sheryl Crow, Heidi Klum, Donald Trump, and a host of others who probably walked through the famous doors of Studio 54 in its heyday. Ellen Albertini Dow plays Disco Dottie, and she was of course the rappin' Grandma Rosie in The Wedding Singer. The disco music, heard in retrospect, is actually kind of thrilling, especially with the excitement of the dancing, and the wall to wall decadence. There is a great disco version of Gordon Lightfoot's ""If You Could Read My Mind"" I kid you not!!!The Bottom Line is that 54 is a really fun film about a certain bygone era. If you remember it that proves you weren't there. If you can find it, if they ever release it on DVD, it would behoove you to see the director's cut. They watered it down, cut out 45 minutes, and inserted 25 minutes of exposition to smooth over the plot gaps. In spite of their tinkering, it was still a flop, so it would have been better to go down in flames with the original cut by director Mark Christopher. A film like 54 is just too fabulous for the masses, and that is why they had to stand behind the velvet rope wishing they could get into Studio 54 and dance the night away.Steve Rubell: Is he gorgeous?Viv: He's gorgeous. Look for yourself.Shane O'Shea: [voiceover] I was warned that Steven didn't hire any dummies and I should be on my toes because he could ask some really tricky questions.Steve Rubell: What's two plus

I  find that period of freedom fascinating and 54 was where the party was.  I'm sure this movie was going somewhere very interesting before the studio  got a hold of it. Laced with sex, drugs, homosexuality and energy, as that  time was, the original cut was probably very good. But, alas, someone got  nervous and added these horrible scenes, and cut the heart out of the film.  They beefed up Neve's role, which was bad, beefed up Mike Myers role, which  he played well but it just didn't work, and just plain messed up the movie.  You can tell all the stuff that was reshot by Ryan's afro wig which looks  nothing like real hair. Watch the original trailer to see things that look  good but never made the final cut. I'm sad to see the DVD has no deleted  scenes, and no Director's Cut edition, I would like to see the real film.  And until these become available, don't waste your time.

Yes, it shows the viewer some of the things that went on in  the club, but not enough.The acting is excellent though. Ryan Phillipe  is much more than just another Hollywood pretty face; he's a good actor.  But the real treat in this film is Mike Myers; his portrayal of the club's  ringmaster is quite impressive.

The film is not so much a celebration of the nightlife but rues the decay that ended the party.  Makes you wonder if the makers of the film were partisans or foes of the disco lifestyle.  Ryan Phillippe is quite good as Shane, a working-class Jersey kid, who is seduced by the artifice of easy sex and drugs that 54 offered.

In this story of New York's world-famous Studio 54, the story is told through the eyes of Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe), a young man from New Jersey who manages to get onto the guest list and into the very exclusive club.  A gas station attendant by day, Shane soon finds himself as one of the regulars and manages to secure himself a job at the club as a bus boy/bartender.Shane befriends two of the club's workers, Greg Randazzo (Brechin Meyer) and his wife Anita (Salma Hayek).  They invite Shane to move in to their apartment, but Greg soon suspects that Shane and Anita are having an affair.  Shane actually has fallen for Julie Black (Neve Campbell), another regular.  A soap opera star, Shane is intrigued by her beauty and is immediately drawn to her.  After a while, the two begin a relationship.Meanwhile, Steve Rubell, played magnificently by Mike Myers, has been laundering money from the club.  Each night, he sends bags full of money out with the trash to be picked up and taken away, out of sight of the I.R.S.  This scam goes on for quite some time until finally the I.R.S. finds out about Rubell's operation and raids the club.Shane, spurned in the end by Julie, eventually leaves 54 to become a college student and restaurant manager.  Steve Rubell is sentenced to 18 months in prison and is forced to sell 54 in a plea agreement. He is allowed to remain as a ""consultant"" to the new ownership, and he also throws a big party at the club's re-opening, attended by Shane, Greg, and Anita.Studio 54 was indeed the king of the discos.  Celebrities from all over the world, including Andy Warhol and Truman Capote, were regular visitors to the club.  The music was loud, and sex and drugs were freely available. Unfortunately, 54 never really regained its prominence after its re-opening, and it closed down for good in 1986.  Steve Rubell died in 1989 at age 45.This movie does an excellent job of showcasing the very famous club, right down to the throngs of people who begged to get in each night.  The acting in the film is very good, but Mike Myers stands out above the rest.  His superb portrayal of the eccentric but troubled Steve Rubell is the highlight of the film.Having grown up in the 70s, I remember reading about Studio 54 and what a fantastic place it was.

When it chooses to concentrate the zeitgeist of a decade into a simple-minded ""don't do drugs"" morality tale. In addition, the film is cynical, naive, historically incomplete, borderline homophobic, and regionally offensive to both New Jersey and New York City! No plot point is fully explored, and some are just abandoned mid way through (the father?!). And despite the critical accolades, I thought Mike Myers portrayal of Steve Rubell was just another vampy facet of his Austin Powers or Cat in the Hat character. He played it as more of a klutzy impression than a living person with real flaws. Had any single uncomfortable scene with Rubell, and there were many, been given more than five minutes of screen time, it might have been a very different and effective film.In the end, ""54"" doesn't have a leg to stand on. It can't successfully moralize against the supposed slick emptiness of disco because it is far emptier at its core, and the story it's trying to tell us is older than the hills.

The patrons were either celebrities or those chosen at the front door because they had the ""look"" of the beautiful people.  Inside was a fantasy of dancing and drugs, all lit by strobe lighting.  And, as it had formerly been a theater, there was a even balcony for those almost private moments of brief romantic encounters.  The waiters and bartenders were all gorgeous young men and wore nothing but shorts and a bow tie.  This is a story of one of these guys.Ryan Phillips is cast in the role of Shane O'Shea, a 19 year old from New Jersey who yearns for a star-studded life.  He's chosen at the door and is big eyed with wonder and desire.  Eventually, he becomes a waiter and later is promoted to bartender.  There are a lot of women.  And there is a lot of money.  He even gets his picture in a magazine.  Everything comes easy for him but he really is interested in a New Jersey girl who's a rising soap opera star.The best role in the film goes to Mike Myers, who plays the legendary Steve Rubell who made it all happen.  He's a strange bird with an eccentric personality and he does a lot of drugs.  The money rolls in and he is in trouble with the IRS.  But he's so puffed up with his own importance that he even brags about it on TV.  Eventually, he's arrested and the party ends.  But before it does, the filmgoers are treated to a small view of what it was back then.I found the story silly, but I loved the nostalgia.  Here was the music and the lights and the feeling of decadence that characterized a time that no longer exists.  I lived through that time period. I remember.

454611,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305210144,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","In the 1970s, a young man named Steve Rubell opened a dance club in New York City called Studio 54. It became the hottest, most fashionable and most notorious nightclub in the world. It was frequented by famous people who were legends in their day, such as Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, Andy Warhol, Princess Grace of Monaco, Liza Minnelli and The Rolling Stones. As for the rest of the customers, admission was granted by Rubell and his doormen not based on how long you had wait in line, but on how beautiful you were. Super models, wall street executives, hookers and hustlers all mingled with the rich and famous. Studio 54 stood as the cathedral of the Me Generation, and many people waited eagerly to see it crumble and fall.54 tries hard to replicate life in and around the ultimate disco. The tale is told by narrator Shane [Ryan Phillippe], a blonde young Adonis from across the river in Jersey. Shane, who's a sheltered dreamer, manages to get a job as a busboy at the club. The allure, the glamour and the attitude there are his vision of Heaven, although from our vantage point, it often look like Hell.There is not much a story. The film paints portraits of some of the customers and employees instead. Mike Myers, playing Steve Rubell, gives a powerful, Oscar caliber performance. His interpretation of this mad Emperor of Dance manages to make Rubell as much of a victim of his generation's excess as a perpetrator.While the film is full of drugs, sex [of all kinds] and rock and roll, it is strangely timid. By pulling their punches, the film's makers never grab the audience. It's as though they were still embarrassed by the excesses of the times. Compared to 1997's boisterous Boogie Nights, it's tame stuff.54 encounters a problem that has plagued many movies. Shane and his new friends who work at the club may be beautiful, but they are so relentlessly self-centered that, in the end, we don't much care where they wind up. It takes a master of the medium to make us feel for characters who take and never give. Only Rubell elicits any sympathy, but the picture does not center on him, as perhaps it should have.The movie does manages to show the high energy of Studio 54. The music, dancing and lighting are fairly faithfully reproduced. The crowds are fun to look at. Rubell's descent into drug-induced madness is similar to the articles I have read about him.54 is in the pop culture class and entertains us a sleek yet trashy way.

It was always going to be hard enough garnering teenage interest in a movie about the 70's disco scene even if it did have some of the hottest young talent out there.  However, despite bad reviews this is actually a good movie.The plot follows Jersey kid Shane (Phillipe) desperate to make it big and ending up as a topless waiter in Studio 54, the hottest nightclub in New York.  There he hooks up with Meyer and Hayek and begins his road to corruption along drugs and meaningless sex in an effort to make something of his life.  Basically that seems to be the main message of the film, collecting together a group of seemingly perfect beautiful people that aren't happy with their lives and seek direction.  Phillipe's wants fame, Hayek wants a singing career, Meyer wants a promotion and more money whilst club owner Steve Rubell (Myers) is the most self-deprecating figure in the movie.Myers gives the performance of his career as the ultimately pathetic Steve Rubell, and the cast of hot young hopefuls surrounding him almost echo their characters in a way, each on the brink of the big time.  Looking at this it's a shame Phillip can't pick better material than 'Antitrust' because he does manage to uphold his role whilst real life friend Meyer and sultry Hayek are both equally good.  Also watch out for a performance from Sherry Stringfield (aka Susan from 'ER').  The only problem is that one of the big-listed stars, Neve Campbell, has all of three scenes in the movie but still manages to sparkle.This is be no ways a bad film, but it's also no classic.  Still it's rare that a cast of teenage hopefuls can uphold such an ultimately bleak movie.

Ryan Phillipe is a young kid from New Jersey who dreams of the big time across the river.  He and two of his pals try to get into 54, but only he is admitted.  Once inside, he is taken back by the scene. The loose sex, lights, drugs and the pounding disco beats are exactly what he is looking for in life.  He eventually gets a job as a bar back and befriends fellow bar back Breckin Meyer and his wife, Selma Hayek, who works in the coat room.  Ms. Hayek has dreams of a singing career.  54 isn't just a job for these people, it's a way of life.  Neve Campbell shows up as a soap star who Mr. Phillipe gets somewhat involved with.  The young stars are all fairly likable, but Mike Myers, who appears as 54's co-founder, the late Steve Ruebell, shines above them all.

454629,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,6305210144,S. Schell,"[4, 4]","What a sad depiction of the verve that existed at the ever notorious and  hedonistic nightclub  residing in the middle of New York's party scene with  crowds of day-trippers, opportunists and native New Yorkers dying to get  past the infamous velvet ropes to make it on the list of ingredients for  Steve Rubell's social &quot;salad bowl&quot;. Instead of taking a detailed  look at the club's corrupt commerce from a legal perspective, it focuses on  a simplistic schmoe who lives across the tracks in New Jersey, just another  speculator with a febrile desire to enter the illustrious doors of the  scandalous hotspot. Ryan Phillippe as the meek-minded Shane O'Shea is  mediocre at best, consistently flaunting his virile physique and golden  skin, his Greek visage a perfect comparison to a depiction a one-night  stand named Billie Auster (Sela Ward in a breathlessly short role)  bequeaths him.Salma Hayek and Breckin Meyer as the utterly piteous and  star-struck couple Anita and Greg are terribly tacky characters and  hopelessly naive. Hayek's only worthy showcase is the skimpy spandex she  dawns when she finally gets her fantasy spot in one of the club's various  stage shows. The only redeeming performance in this whole movie is Mike  Meyers as the seedy Steve Rubell, the man behind the magic and the  instigator of Studio 54. He exhibits the drunken queerness convincingly,  and I was almost repelled by how well he infused himself with the character  to beget Steve's bizarre and almost creepy aura.Where this film really  falls short is cheapening the audience on the history of the kitsch club,  excluding the names of its renowned employees and promoters. A good example  of a missing link is the more notable omission of Ian Schrager, Rubell's  right-hand man and business partner. It was widely whispered that Schrager  demanded he be omitted from the film's script to protect his privacy. Who  also was never mentioned is Carmen D'Alessio, Studio 54's promoter and  party coordinator. This woman did a lot of work for Schrager and Rubell,  telephoning numerous agents and mailing out invites for some of their more  stylish celebrations they held during the years that the establishment's  doors were wide open to the lucky few. It is far more fascinating and  edifying to watch VH1's Behind the Music documentary on the lurid and  legendary discotheque that was populated by countless celebrities in the  past, including superstars like Michael Jackson, Liza Minelli, Muriel  Hemingway, Brooke Shields, Grace Jones, Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall. What I  think would've added a good deal of pizzazz and nostalgia to the movie is a  wide variety of cameos from celebrities who frequented the club most in its  glory days and even the disreputably offensive doormen. If you're going to  make a movie about one of America's most riotous eras, why not throw some  of its more eminent faces into it?What this movie did manage to portray  very well is the self-indulgence of all its patrons and the showmanship of  the extravagant parties. The balloons, the confetti, the disco lights and  the shrine-like display of the moon and its cocaine spoon were recreated  with the panache of its decade. 1978 screamed from the screen unto the  viewer's eyes each time Shane took a romp around the dance floor. Couples  kissed, tongued, sniffed, popped and even openly had sex among other  partygoers. As far as capturing the time period, there's no dispute  regarding accuracy.Overall, I grant this film a two-and-a-half star  rating for its honest effort and Meyer's enthralling portrayal of the  wizard behind New York's version of Oz. However, I would like to point out  the deficient segment where Shane traverses into the basement. There's  nothing remotely close going on in there to what people have described or  refused to describe. This was THE basement, people. Just watch the  documentary and you'll see many a celebrity raise an eyebrow when asked  about what went on down there. I kept wishing that the director would give  a more informative lead into the sordid activity that was rumored to have  occurred. I guess that, like other things, should remain reasonably  confidential...",2,"All Melodrama, No Mystique (2.5 stars)",968198400,"09 6, 2000",2000,4203,"['What', 'sad', 'depiction', 'verve', 'existed', 'ever', 'notorious', 'hedonistic', 'nightclub', 'residing', 'middle', 'New', 'York', 'party', 'scene', 'crowds', 'day-trippers', 'opportunists', 'native', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'dying', 'get', 'infamous', 'velvet', 'ropes', 'make', 'list', 'ingredients', 'Steve', 'Rubell', 'social', 'quot', 'bowl', 'quot', 'Instead', 'taking', 'detailed', 'look', 'club', 'corrupt', 'commerce', 'legal', 'perspective', 'simplistic', 'schmoe', 'who', 'tracks', 'New', 'Jersey', 'just', 'speculator', 'febrile', 'desire', 'enter', 'illustrious', 'doors', 'scandalous', 'hotspot', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'meek-minded', 'Shane', ""O'Shea"", 'mediocre', 'best', 'consistently', 'flaunting', 'virile', 'physique', 'golden', 'skin', 'Greek', 'visage', 'perfect', 'comparison', 'depiction', 'one-night', 'stand', 'named', 'Billie', 'Auster', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'breathlessly', 'short', 'role', 'him.Salma', 'Hayek', 'Breckin', 'Meyer', 'utterly', 'piteous', 'star-struck', 'couple', 'Anita', 'Greg', 'are', 'terribly', 'tacky', 'characters', 'hopelessly', 'naive', 'Hayek', 'only', 'worthy', 'showcase', 'skimpy', 'spandex', 'when', 'finally', 'fantasy', 'spot', 'one', 'club', 'various', 'stage', 'shows', 'only', 'redeeming', 'performance', 'whole', 'movie', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'seedy', 'Steve', 'Rubell', 'man', 'magic', 'instigator', 'Studio', '54', 'drunken', 'queerness', 'convincingly', 'was', 'almost', 'repelled', 'how', 'well', 'infused', 'character', 'beget', 'Steve', 'bizarre', 'almost', 'creepy', 'aura.Where', 'film', 'really', 'short', 'cheapening', 'audience', 'history', 'kitsch', 'club', 'excluding', 'names', 'renowned', 'employees', 'promoters', 'good', 'example', 'missing', 'link', 'more', 'notable', 'omission', 'Ian', 'Schrager', 'Rubell', 'right-hand', 'man', 'business', 'partner', 'was', 'widely', 'whispered', 'Schrager', 'demanded', 'be', 'omitted', 'film', 'script', 'protect', 'privacy', 'Who', 'also', 'was', 'never', 'mentioned', 'Carmen', ""D'Alessio"", 'Studio', '54', 'promoter', 'party', 'coordinator', 'woman', 'did', 'lot', 'work', 'Schrager', 'Rubell', 'telephoning', 'numerous', 'agents', 'mailing', 'out', 'invites', 'more', 'stylish', 'celebrations', 'held', 'years', 'establishment', 'doors', 'were', 'wide', 'open', 'lucky', 'few', 'far', 'more', 'fascinating', 'edifying', 'watch', 'VH1', 'Music', 'documentary', 'lurid', 'legendary', 'discotheque', 'was', 'populated', 'countless', 'celebrities', 'past', 'including', 'superstars', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Liza', 'Minelli', 'Muriel', 'Hemingway', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'Grace', 'Jones', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'Jerry', 'Hall', 'What', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'added', 'good', 'deal', 'pizzazz', 'nostalgia', 'movie', 'wide', 'variety', 'cameos', 'celebrities', 'who', 'frequented', 'club', 'most', 'glory', 'days', 'even', 'disreputably', 'offensive', 'doormen', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'riotous', 'eras', 'why', 'not', 'throw', 'more', 'eminent', 'What', 'movie', 'did', 'manage', 'portray', 'very', 'well', 'self-indulgence', 'patrons', 'showmanship', 'extravagant', 'parties', 'balloons', 'confetti', 'disco', 'lights', 'shrine-like', 'display', 'moon', 'cocaine', 'spoon', 'were', 'recreated', 'panache', 'decade', '1978', 'screamed', 'screen', 'viewer', 'eyes', 'time', 'Shane', 'took', 'romp', 'dance', 'floor', 'Couples', 'kissed', 'tongued', 'sniffed', 'popped', 'even', 'openly', 'had', 'sex', 'other', 'partygoers', 'As', 'far', 'capturing', 'time', 'period', 'dispute', 'regarding', 'accuracy.Overall', 'grant', 'film', 'two-and-a-half', 'star', 'rating', 'honest', 'effort', 'Meyer', 'enthralling', 'portrayal', 'wizard', 'New', 'York', 'version', 'Oz', 'However', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'deficient', 'segment', 'where', 'Shane', 'basement', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'close', 'going', 'what', 'people', 'have', 'described', 'refused', 'describe', 'was', 'basement', 'people', 'Just', 'watch', 'documentary', ""'ll"", 'see', 'many', 'celebrity', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'when', 'asked', 'what', 'went', 'there', 'kept', 'wishing', 'director', 'would', 'give', 'more', 'informative', 'lead', 'sordid', 'activity', 'was', 'rumored', 'have', 'occurred', 'guess', 'other', 'things', 'should', 'remain', 'reasonably', 'confidential']",54 VHS
