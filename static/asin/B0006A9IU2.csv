864712,A3K1LK6DJCVPUK,B0006A9IU2,K. Palmer,"[119, 120]","Rodney Dangerfield was the King of Comedy.  When he was on, there wasn't anybody funnier on the planet.  So I was looking forward to the release of this 3 DVD set that would chronicle Rodney through the years.The discs contain 3 shows that ran on network TV in the early 1980s along with 4 HBO specials where Rodney was the host, but the main focus was on the young comedians of the day (you see Tim Allen, Roseanne Barr, Jerry Seinfeld, Robert Townshend all before they hit the big time along with others who you never saw again).  Also included was Rodney's appearance on ONE Tonight Show episode (Rodney appeared on the show over 70 times according to the disc). In addition, a 45 minute standup routine taped in 1995 is included as well as a segment of ""This is Your Life"".The network TV shows are disappointing because they primarily contain fairly lame skits and lame musical numbers (although I did get a kick out of ""Rappin' Rodney"") and because they were network shows, they were not very risque.  The HBO shows also disappoint because the focus is not on Rodney, but the other comedians.  He does do an opening monologue in each along with skits in between performers, but these also don't generate a lot of laughs (except for the skits Rodney did with Roseanne, she actually was pretty funny).  Sam Kinison also does a funny bit at a piano in a skit with Rodney.The ""This Is Your Life"" segment was interesting as they trotted out people from Rodney's life, but having read his recent autobiography, I knew most of the information anyway.The 1995 standup routine was disappointing because most of the jokes were the same ones he told 15 to 20 years earlier on the ""No Respect"" album.  It doesn't appear like he added much new material.  And I believe the audience must have heard the jokes many times before because they don't seem to be laughing much.  Rodney also seems very cranky as well and it looks and sounds like he just wanted to get off the stage.  In addition, the video quality of this is very poor for something done in 1995.The best part of the disc is his appearance on the Tonight Show (I would guess in the late 70s or early 80s).  It was Rodney at his very best.  After a funny monologue, he went to sit next to Carson and just started rifling off one liners in rapid fire motion.  All were fairly fresh and the timing was perfect.  Carson knew when to interject to set Rodney up.  The only disappointing thing about this is that it is only about 8 minutes long, but its the best thing on the set.I'm glad to see something come out for this late, great comedian.  I just wish it would have better showcased his talents.  I would love to see a disc of his best moments on Carson's show.  That would be great.",2,A Little Disappointed In This Package,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,2735,"['Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'was', 'King', 'Comedy', 'When', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'anybody', 'funnier', 'planet', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'release', '3', 'DVD', 'set', 'would', 'chronicle', 'Rodney', 'years.The', 'discs', 'contain', '3', 'shows', 'ran', 'network', 'TV', 'early', '1980s', '4', 'HBO', 'specials', 'where', 'Rodney', 'was', 'host', 'main', 'focus', 'was', 'young', 'comedians', 'day', 'see', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Roseanne', 'Barr', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Robert', 'Townshend', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'others', 'who', 'never', 'saw', 'again', 'Also', 'included', 'was', 'Rodney', 'appearance', 'ONE', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'episode', 'Rodney', 'appeared', 'show', '70', 'times', 'according', 'disc', 'addition', '45', 'minute', 'standup', 'routine', 'taped', '1995', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'segment', 'Your', 'Life', '.The', 'network', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'disappointing', 'primarily', 'contain', 'fairly', 'lame', 'skits', 'lame', 'musical', 'numbers', 'did', 'get', 'kick', 'Rappin', 'Rodney', 'were', 'network', 'shows', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'risque', 'HBO', 'shows', 'also', 'disappoint', 'focus', 'not', 'Rodney', 'other', 'comedians', 'do', 'opening', 'monologue', 'skits', 'performers', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'generate', 'lot', 'laughs', 'skits', 'Rodney', 'did', 'Roseanne', 'actually', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'also', 'funny', 'bit', 'piano', 'skit', 'Rodney.The', 'Your', 'Life', 'segment', 'was', 'interesting', 'trotted', 'out', 'people', 'Rodney', 'life', 'having', 'read', 'recent', 'autobiography', 'knew', 'most', 'information', 'anyway.The', '1995', 'standup', 'routine', 'was', 'disappointing', 'most', 'jokes', 'were', 'same', 'ones', 'told', '15', '20', 'years', 'earlier', 'Respect', 'album', ""n't"", 'appear', 'added', 'much', 'new', 'material', 'believe', 'audience', 'must', 'have', 'heard', 'jokes', 'many', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'laughing', 'much', 'Rodney', 'also', 'very', 'cranky', 'well', 'just', 'wanted', 'get', 'off', 'stage', 'addition', 'video', 'quality', 'very', 'poor', 'something', 'done', '1995.The', 'best', 'part', 'disc', 'appearance', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'would', 'guess', 'late', '70s', 'early', '80s', 'was', 'Rodney', 'very', 'best', 'funny', 'monologue', 'went', 'sit', 'next', 'Carson', 'just', 'started', 'rifling', 'off', 'one', 'liners', 'rapid', 'fire', 'motion', 'were', 'fairly', 'fresh', 'timing', 'was', 'perfect', 'Carson', 'knew', 'when', 'interject', 'set', 'Rodney', 'up', 'only', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'only', 'about', '8', 'minutes', 'long', 'best', 'thing', 'set.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'something', 'come', 'out', 'late', 'great', 'comedian', 'just', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'showcased', 'talents', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'disc', 'best', 'moments', 'Carson', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'great']",N/A

In a word the man was without doubt the greatest male stand up comedian ever (Phyllis Diller the female). These were the Ed Sullivan years and the early Tonight Show years. However. Working close with him I could see something creeping in that began to affect and cloud his good judgement. Call it keeping up with the times, wanting to compete with younger comedians (I have my own theory which I will not comment on) and what happened was a deep slide from self depreciating good clean fun to offensive barbs at his children and wife that were down right humiliating and embarrassing. The problem was he was such a master at his craft that you didn't realize just how offfensive the jokes were until you gave them thought later. Much of the material offered here is offensive as stated by a recent viewer who bought the collection. This should serve as a warning. If you really want to remember Rodney for the genious he was then unfortunately you'll have to wait for the Sullivan and Tonight Show routines to be released. Otherwise you are very likely to be offended and put off by some of this very off color material.

However, before you buy and sit down to watch with your younger and even senior family members or friends, be prepared for comedy with lots of sexual overtones and risque language.  Much of the early standup comedy of very popular comedians centered around R and X rated material and this dvd pack does not go against this premise.  The standup act of Andrew ""Dice"" Clay speaks for itself but even the likes of early Jeff Foxworthy, Jerry Seinfeld, and Tim Allen among others were created for the adult audience and you will most likely be embarrassed watching it with anyone in their senior years and it is definatley not appropriate for the younger set.  The 3 dvd set is a progression in the rating system.  In my opinion, dvd #1 was PG to PG-13, dvd #2 was R to NC-17, and dvd #3 was NC-17 to X.  Being middle aged, I found the dvd's very funny and entertaining but not while watching with my elderly mother. I bought this because she loved Rodney Dangerfield but she never saw him and other comedians she regularly sees on network TV such as Roseanne Barr, Tim Allen, etc. in this venue.

864716,A1WLZYEOIL1HLT,B0006A9IU2,"Michael King ""Mike""","[15, 16]","It's great to finally have so many TV specials and rare concert footage of Rodney Dangerfield available on DVD, but it's a shame that it wasn't released until after he died.  Disc 1 contains three ABC TV specials: ""It's Not Easy Bein' Me (1981), ""I Can't Take It No More"" (1983), and ""Exposed"" (1984).  Rodney's skits are very funny, although some of the musical numbers have not aged well.  The 1983 special is outstanding, especially the skits ""Flashpants"" (a spoof of the movie Flashdance), where Rodney plays a male stripper who dreams of being a welder, and ""The Party Saver,"" where Rodney changes from a mild-mannered party pooper to the hilarious life of the party.Disc 2 contains three HBO specials: ""It's Not Easy Bein' Me"" (1986), ""Nothin' Goes Right"" (1987), and ""The Really Big Show"" (1991).  Basically, Rodney acts as host and does some skits in-between standup routines of other comedians.  Since the specials aired on cable TV, the language and subject matter are more adult than on the first disc.  In the 1986 special, Roseanne plays Rodney's blushing bride and later pregnant wife with hilarious results.  Sam Kinison and Jerry Seinfeld turn in outstanding performances.  The 1987 special features great sets by Lenny Clarke, Dom Irrera and Andrew Dice Clay.  The first two specials were filmed at Dangerfield's nightclub in New York City.  The 1991 special was filmed at various comedy clubs and concert halls in California, such as the Improv.  None of the featured comedians are famous, and the way Rodney is treated by everyone is not just disrespectful but downright mean.  ""The Really Big Show"" is the weakest special in the boxed set.Disc 3 could be subtitled the Vegas disc.  It starts off with ""Opening Night At Rodney's Place"" (1989), which was filmed at the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas.  Tim Allen and Jeff Foxworthy are in top form doing their standup routines.  The best skit finds Rodney auditioning for a role in a porno movie, and meeting adult film star Ron Jeremy, which prompts Rodney to declare that all men are not created equal!  This is followed by the TV special ""This Is Your Life,"" which was filmed after Rodney's act at the Alladin Hotel in Las Vegas.  We finally get to see Rodney's son and daughter from his first marriage.  The only non-Vegas segment is an outstanding performance by Rodney on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.  After a brilliant routine, Rodney takes a seat next to Johnny.  Instead of having a conversation, Rodney keeps firing off jokes, while Johnny can barely get a word in edgewise.  The final section is a 1988 concert performance of Rodney's entire act, filmed at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, which is incorrectly noted as being recorded at Bally's Hotel.  The video quality is that of a good bootleg, and the crowd is somewhat unresponsive.  Still, it's great to be able to see the master at work in Las Vegas.",5,A Treasure Trove Of Rodney Dangerfield,1106956800,"01 29, 2005",2005,2887,"['great', 'finally', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'TV', 'specials', 'rare', 'concert', 'footage', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'available', 'DVD', 'shame', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'died', 'Disc', '1', 'contains', 'three', 'ABC', 'TV', 'specials', 'Not', 'Easy', 'Bein', 'Me', '1981', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'More', '1983', 'Exposed', '1984', 'Rodney', 'skits', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'musical', 'numbers', 'have', 'not', 'aged', 'well', '1983', 'special', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'skits', 'Flashpants', 'spoof', 'movie', 'Flashdance', 'where', 'Rodney', 'male', 'stripper', 'who', 'being', 'welder', 'Party', 'Saver', 'where', 'Rodney', 'mild-mannered', 'party', 'pooper', 'hilarious', 'life', 'party.Disc', '2', 'contains', 'three', 'HBO', 'specials', 'Not', 'Easy', 'Bein', 'Me', '1986', 'Nothin', 'Goes', 'Right', '1987', 'Really', 'Big', 'Show', '1991', 'Basically', 'Rodney', 'host', 'skits', 'in-between', 'standup', 'routines', 'other', 'comedians', 'specials', 'aired', 'cable', 'TV', 'language', 'subject', 'matter', 'are', 'more', 'adult', 'first', 'disc', '1986', 'special', 'Roseanne', 'Rodney', 'blushing', 'bride', 'later', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'hilarious', 'results', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'turn', 'outstanding', 'performances', '1987', 'special', 'features', 'great', 'sets', 'Lenny', 'Clarke', 'Dom', 'Irrera', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'first', 'two', 'specials', 'were', 'filmed', 'Dangerfield', 'nightclub', 'New', 'York', 'City', '1991', 'special', 'was', 'filmed', 'various', 'comedy', 'clubs', 'concert', 'halls', 'California', 'such', 'Improv', 'None', 'featured', 'comedians', 'are', 'famous', 'way', 'Rodney', 'treated', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'disrespectful', 'downright', 'mean', 'Really', 'Big', 'Show', 'weakest', 'special', 'boxed', 'set.Disc', '3', 'could', 'be', 'subtitled', 'Vegas', 'disc', 'Opening', 'Night', 'Rodney', 'Place', '1989', 'was', 'filmed', 'Tropicana', 'Hotel', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'doing', 'standup', 'routines', 'best', 'skit', 'Rodney', 'auditioning', 'role', 'porno', 'movie', 'meeting', 'adult', 'film', 'star', 'Ron', 'Jeremy', 'Rodney', 'declare', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'created', 'equal', 'followed', 'TV', 'special', 'Your', 'Life', 'was', 'filmed', 'Rodney', 'act', 'Alladin', 'Hotel', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'Rodney', 'son', 'daughter', 'first', 'marriage', 'only', 'non-Vegas', 'segment', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Rodney', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'brilliant', 'routine', 'Rodney', 'seat', 'next', 'Johnny', 'Instead', 'having', 'conversation', 'Rodney', 'firing', 'off', 'jokes', 'Johnny', 'can', 'barely', 'get', 'word', 'edgewise', 'final', 'section', '1988', 'concert', 'performance', 'Rodney', 'entire', 'act', 'filmed', 'MGM', 'Grand', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'incorrectly', 'noted', 'being', 'recorded', 'Bally', 'Hotel', 'video', 'quality', 'good', 'bootleg', 'crowd', 'somewhat', 'unresponsive', 'Still', 'great', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'master', 'work', 'Las', 'Vegas']",N/A

Rodney has been making me laugh since I was a little kid, and along with a few others, Rodney was a crucial part of the forming of my sense of humor.  I was sad when he died.  I'm always a bit sad when a celebrity I like dies, but Rodney's death hit me hard.  Sure, he was older and it was his time, but since he'd always been there throughout childhood and adolescence, I guess I was beginning to think the guy was actually gonna live forever.  He will though thanks to this dvd collection.  Many of these shows I haven't seen in over a decade and some I've never seen.  There isn't a lot of Rodney's actual standup(from what I understand not alot was filmed), but his specials which showcase young comedians.  Rodney always pops up between performances with some amusing words.  I remember seeing Tim Allen and Jeff Foxworthy on his special before they got big, but the difference here is that they're both actually funny.  Maybe it's because their language wasn't restricted.  It's also a trip down memory lane to see Sam Kinison(RIP) and Andrew Dice Clay.  I never liked Dice, but it was still cool to see him after so many years.  You get to see Rosanne's first appearance which is good or bad depending on your taste.  And of course, a young Jerry Seinfeld.  Time hasn't changed him one bit. With so many rotten comics anymore, you really owe it to yourself to check this set out.  Rodney may not be with us anymore, but he can still make us laugh.  Funny how he based his entire act around getting no respect, coz that's all he'll ever get from me.",5,Never Equalled,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,1611,"['ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'happy', 'was', 'see', 'released', 'Rodney', 'been', 'making', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'along', 'few', 'others', 'Rodney', 'was', 'crucial', 'part', 'forming', 'sense', 'humor', 'was', 'sad', 'when', 'died', ""'m"", 'always', 'bit', 'sad', 'when', 'celebrity', 'dies', 'Rodney', 'death', 'hit', 'hard', 'Sure', 'was', 'older', 'was', 'time', ""'d"", 'always', 'been', 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'guess', 'was', 'beginning', 'think', 'guy', 'was', 'actually', 'gon', 'live', 'forever', 'will', 'though', 'thanks', 'dvd', 'collection', 'Many', 'shows', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'decade', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', ""n't"", 'lot', 'Rodney', 'actual', 'standup', 'what', 'understand', 'not', 'alot', 'was', 'filmed', 'specials', 'showcase', 'young', 'comedians', 'Rodney', 'always', 'up', 'performances', 'amusing', 'words', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'special', 'got', 'big', 'difference', 'here', ""'re"", 'actually', 'funny', 'Maybe', 'language', 'was', ""n't"", 'restricted', 'also', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'see', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'RIP', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'never', 'liked', 'Dice', 'was', 'still', 'cool', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'get', 'see', 'Rosanne', 'first', 'appearance', 'good', 'bad', 'depending', 'taste', 'course', 'young', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Time', ""n't"", 'changed', 'one', 'bit', 'so', 'many', 'rotten', 'comics', 'anymore', 'really', 'owe', 'yourself', 'check', 'set', 'out', 'Rodney', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'anymore', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'Funny', 'how', 'based', 'entire', 'act', 'getting', 'respect', 'coz', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'get']",N/A

But it was on the Ed Sullivan show where Rodney first made his TV debut.  The disc provides some of those great tonight show appearances.  I only wish some of those Sullivan appearances were there too.Then we have in full some of Rodney's great TV and cable specials.  his self-deprecating humor and classic ""I tell ya I get no respect"" are some of the most well-known bits in comedy history.His special ""It's not Easy Bein Me"" from 1986 presents Rodney at perhaps the pinnacle of his popularity.  Fresh from hit movies like Caddyshack and EasyMoney, Rodney would do what he does best..a great stand=up act as well as introducing the world to some of the hot young comedians like Jerry Seinfeld, Jeff Altman, and the immortal Sam Kinnison.A wonderful tribute to one of the all-time greats!",5,Great Tribute to a Great Comedian,1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,1044,"['world', 'lost', 'one', 'greatest', 'stand-up', 'comedians', 'when', 'Rodney', 'passed', 'away', 'recently', 'will', 'always', 'live', 'thanks', 'great', '3', 'disc', 'set.Like', 'many', 'first', 'saw', 'Rodney', 'one', 'many', 'tonight', 'Show', 'where', 'appeared', '70', 'times', 'was', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'show', 'where', 'Rodney', 'first', 'made', 'TV', 'debut', 'disc', 'great', 'tonight', 'show', 'appearances', 'only', 'wish', 'Sullivan', 'appearances', 'were', 'there', 'too.Then', 'have', 'full', 'Rodney', 'great', 'TV', 'cable', 'specials', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', 'classic', 'tell', 'ya', 'get', 'respect', 'are', 'most', 'well-known', 'bits', 'comedy', 'history.His', 'special', 'not', 'Easy', 'Bein', 'Me', '1986', 'presents', 'Rodney', 'perhaps', 'pinnacle', 'popularity', 'Fresh', 'hit', 'movies', 'Caddyshack', 'EasyMoney', 'Rodney', 'would', 'do', 'what', 'best..a', 'great', 'stand=up', 'act', 'as', 'well', 'introducing', 'world', 'hot', 'young', 'comedians', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Jeff', 'Altman', 'immortal', 'Sam', 'Kinnison.A', 'wonderful', 'tribute', 'one', 'all-time', 'greats']",N/A
864723,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0006A9IU2,trebe,"[2, 2]","Known for years mostly as a standup comedian, the films Caddyshack (1980), Easy Money (1983), and Back To School (1986), introduced Rodney Dangerfield (1921-2004) to a new younger audience, reinvigorating his career.  The comic who largely built his act upon a deadpan delivery, and getting ""no respect"", is featured in this three DVD collection Rodney Dangerfield: No Respect (2004), which contains material mostly from the 1980's, when he was at the height of his popularity.  This collection includes some comedy specials that are available separately, as well as some new material.Disc One contains three variety type specials, It's Not Easy Being Me (1981) featuring Bill Murray, Valerie Perrine, and Roseanne Barr; I Can't Take It No More (1983) featuring Robert Urich, Angie Dickinson, and Andy Kaufman; and Exposed! (1984), with Morgan Fairchild, and Harvey Korman.  These ABC productions are mostly a mixture of standup and sketch comedy, and do not feature profanity.  Dangerfield had a thing for blondes, and among the ladies in these specials, Morgan Fairchild probably displays the most versatility and enthusiasm.Disc Two contains three HBO specials, It's Not Easy Being Me (1986), Nothin' Goes Right (1987), and The Really Big Show (1991).  Standup comedy was immensely popular in the late 80's, and these programs mostly feature various standup comics from the era, with Rodney acting as host, and also doing some sketch comedy.  The material is adult, the language uncensored, and there is even some brief nudity.  Among the comedians featured are Robert Schimmel, Jeff Altman, Carol Leifer, Bob Nelson, Andrew Dice Clay, Jerry Seinfeld, Dom Irrera, and the always demure Sam Kinison.Disc Three features the cable special, Opening Night At Rodney's Place (1989), recorded at the Tropicana Hotel in Vegas, with Tim Allen, Jeff Foxworthy, Thea Vidale, and Sam Kinison.  In a riotous spoof of The Tonight Show, Rich Little appears as Johnny Carson, and Chuck McCann as Ed McMahon, in a profanity laden sketch, that also features Heather Thomas impersonating Joan Embery from the San Diego zoo.  More definitely adult content.Quite touching is an episode of This Is Your Life from 1981, where host David Frost bushwhacks Rodney onstage during a performance at the Aladdin Hotel, in Las Vegas, to celebrate the comedian's career.  For once, even Rodney is knocked a little off his game, and is genuinely surprised and touched, as the guy who gets no respect, finally gets some recognition.One of Dangerfield's many appearances on The Tonight Show is included.  And lastly a never before released 48 minute standup performance from 1988, recorded at the MGM Grand in Vegas.  The video quality isn't the greatest, but it is an authentic uncensored look at Rodney Dangerfield in his true element.While some of this material spotlights Rodney Dangerfield, much of it features him as a host, with significant time devoted to other comedians performing their routines.  Those expecting to see Rodney Dangerfield at the center of attention, may be disappointed.  This is a fair criticism, and while it certainly would be fabulous to see more of Dangerfield, for now this collection appears to be the best available.Dangerfield had a long history of aiding the careers of others.  He had opened his own comedy club in New York City called Dangerfield's in 1969, and through the years, the club helped keep the art of standup alive, and also provided a place for rising comedians to hone their craft.  These contributions are also part of Rodney Dangerfield's legacy, and are another reason why he is in fact highly respected, by his comedy brethren.",3,"variety, standup, skits, career retrospective, a ton of sweat, and more, from Rodney Dangerfield . . .",1280620800,"08 1, 2010",2010,3653,"['Known', 'years', 'mostly', 'standup', 'comedian', 'films', 'Caddyshack', '1980', 'Easy', 'Money', '1983', 'Back', 'School', '1986', 'introduced', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', '1921-2004', 'new', 'younger', 'audience', 'reinvigorating', 'career', 'comic', 'who', 'largely', 'built', 'act', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'getting', 'respect', 'featured', 'three', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'Respect', '2004', 'material', 'mostly', '1980', 'when', 'was', 'height', 'popularity', 'collection', 'comedy', 'specials', 'are', 'available', 'separately', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'material.Disc', 'One', 'three', 'variety', 'type', 'specials', 'Not', 'Easy', 'Being', 'Me', '1981', 'featuring', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'Roseanne', 'Barr', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'No', 'More', '1983', 'featuring', 'Robert', 'Urich', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'Exposed', '1984', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'Harvey', 'Korman', 'ABC', 'productions', 'are', 'mostly', 'mixture', 'standup', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'do', 'not', 'feature', 'profanity', 'Dangerfield', 'had', 'thing', 'blondes', 'ladies', 'specials', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'probably', 'most', 'versatility', 'enthusiasm.Disc', 'Two', 'contains', 'three', 'HBO', 'specials', 'Not', 'Easy', 'Being', 'Me', '1986', 'Nothin', 'Goes', 'Right', '1987', 'Really', 'Big', 'Show', '1991', 'Standup', 'comedy', 'was', 'immensely', 'popular', 'late', '80', 'programs', 'mostly', 'feature', 'various', 'standup', 'comics', 'era', 'Rodney', 'acting', 'host', 'also', 'doing', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'material', 'adult', 'language', 'uncensored', 'even', 'brief', 'nudity', 'comedians', 'featured', 'are', 'Robert', 'Schimmel', 'Jeff', 'Altman', 'Carol', 'Leifer', 'Bob', 'Nelson', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Dom', 'Irrera', 'always', 'demure', 'Sam', 'Kinison.Disc', 'Three', 'cable', 'special', 'Opening', 'Night', 'Rodney', 'Place', '1989', 'recorded', 'Tropicana', 'Hotel', 'Vegas', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'Thea', 'Vidale', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'riotous', 'spoof', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'Rich', 'Little', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'Chuck', 'McCann', 'Ed', 'McMahon', 'profanity', 'laden', 'sketch', 'also', 'Heather', 'Thomas', 'impersonating', 'Joan', 'Embery', 'San', 'Diego', 'zoo', 'More', 'definitely', 'adult', 'content.Quite', 'touching', 'episode', 'Your', 'Life', '1981', 'where', 'host', 'David', 'Frost', 'bushwhacks', 'Rodney', 'onstage', 'performance', 'Aladdin', 'Hotel', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'celebrate', 'comedian', 'career', 'once', 'even', 'Rodney', 'knocked', 'little', 'off', 'game', 'genuinely', 'surprised', 'touched', 'guy', 'who', 'respect', 'finally', 'recognition.One', 'Dangerfield', 'many', 'appearances', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'included', 'lastly', 'never', 'released', '48', 'minute', 'standup', 'performance', '1988', 'recorded', 'MGM', 'Grand', 'Vegas', 'video', 'quality', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'authentic', 'uncensored', 'look', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'true', 'element.While', 'material', 'spotlights', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'much', 'host', 'significant', 'time', 'devoted', 'other', 'comedians', 'performing', 'routines', 'expecting', 'see', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'center', 'attention', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'fair', 'criticism', 'certainly', 'would', 'be', 'fabulous', 'see', 'more', 'Dangerfield', 'now', 'collection', 'be', 'best', 'available.Dangerfield', 'had', 'long', 'history', 'aiding', 'careers', 'others', 'had', 'opened', 'own', 'comedy', 'club', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'called', 'Dangerfield', '1969', 'years', 'club', 'helped', 'keep', 'art', 'standup', 'alive', 'also', 'provided', 'place', 'rising', 'comedians', 'hone', 'craft', 'contributions', 'are', 'also', 'part', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'legacy', 'are', 'reason', 'why', 'fact', 'highly', 'respected', 'comedy', 'brethren']",N/A
