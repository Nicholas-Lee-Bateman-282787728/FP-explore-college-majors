200729,A25A0MJV5TXDR8,630018207X,"A customer ""yourpalvince""","[1, 10]","Not liking this movie in no way reflects critically on the skier's life and misfortune; understand that first.  That having been said, I have to tell you that I hated this movie and the  Hallmarkesque treatment it gave this skier's tragic story.  The filmmakers didn't care about Kinmont; they had both eyes on the audience, with plenty of Kleenex at the ready.  I used to discuss one part of this movie in my college English classes as an example of how not to tell a story:SPOILER ALERTFor those of you who saw it, remember when the phone call comes, informing the family of her lover's death?  I swear, that call was followed by a slow pan across each family member's face as he or she cried, culminating in Marilyn Hassett bawling away for us.  Am I right?  How can a movie move anyone to tears when it's doing all the crying?  This was the visual equivalent of purple prose, but, as you can see from the other posts here, purple prose sells, else it wouldn't exist.",1,From the So-bad-it's-good Dept.,977097600,"12 18, 2000",2000,970,"['Not', 'liking', 'movie', 'way', 'critically', 'skier', 'life', 'misfortune', 'first', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'have', 'tell', 'hated', 'movie', 'Hallmarkesque', 'treatment', 'gave', 'skier', 'tragic', 'story', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Kinmont', 'had', 'eyes', 'audience', 'plenty', 'Kleenex', 'ready', 'used', 'discuss', 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'college', 'English', 'classes', 'example', 'how', 'not', 'tell', 'story', 'SPOILER', 'ALERTFor', 'who', 'saw', 'remember', 'when', 'phone', 'call', 'informing', 'family', 'lover', 'death', 'swear', 'call', 'was', 'followed', 'slow', 'pan', 'family', 'member', 'face', 'cried', 'culminating', 'Marilyn', 'Hassett', 'bawling', 'away', 'Am', 'right', 'How', 'can', 'movie', 'move', 'anyone', 'tears', 'when', 'doing', 'crying', 'was', 'visual', 'equivalent', 'purple', 'prose', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'posts', 'here', 'purple', 'prose', 'else', 'would', ""n't"", 'exist']","The Other Side of Mountain, Part 2 VHS  1978"
200730,A39FJV2G99WGQI,630018207X,Anibeth,"[6, 9]","The continuation of the struggle of Kinmont is occassionally met with setbacks, and her insensitivity to other people as well as to her own. The dialogues tends to be off the mark, but the most heart warming scene is the extreme sensitivity of her new boyfriend who loves her unconditionally and who wants to help her inspite of her disability. The fault is not the actors who portayed the life of Kinmont with dignity, and those who surround her with their influence. Its hard to say how much I like the movie on the first part, but I love the part of  love and how it is spoken from the heart.

200733,A1VWHBVNS1P2N3,630018207X,George Redding,"[0, 0]","This has to be one of the most touching movies I have ever seen. Marilyn Hassett is so appealing as the sweet but very unhappy Jill Kinmont, the one who wrongly comes to believe that she is a ""jinx"" to others around her; in a sense she blames herself for the death of her father and her first lover. Timothy Bottoms, in perhaps in best role, plays the part of a person unhappy himself, thanks to a previous unfortunate, failed relationship. The two come to realize that they cannot do without each other, both feeling so much void in their lives and each finding in the other the one that can fill the void. I choke up thinking about this wonderful movie. The California scenery was beautifully breath-taking and, again, the story was heart-warming.",5,Unusually warm,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,749,"['be', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Marilyn', 'Hassett', 'so', 'appealing', 'sweet', 'very', 'unhappy', 'Jill', 'Kinmont', 'one', 'who', 'wrongly', 'believe', 'jinx', 'others', 'sense', 'death', 'father', 'first', 'lover', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'perhaps', 'best', 'role', 'part', 'person', 'unhappy', 'thanks', 'previous', 'unfortunate', 'failed', 'relationship', 'two', 'come', 'realize', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'other', 'feeling', 'so', 'much', 'void', 'lives', 'finding', 'other', 'one', 'can', 'fill', 'void', 'choke', 'up', 'thinking', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'California', 'scenery', 'was', 'beautifully', 'breath-taking', 'again', 'story', 'was', 'heart-warming']","The Other Side of Mountain, Part 2 VHS  1978"
200734,A2BIG1DQVEH41W,630018207X,jeanette chisholm,"[14, 14]","I have seen both movies, of course &quot;The Other Side of the Mountain&quot; and this one.  It's always heartbreaking to see a young life at the peak of a dream they have worked so hard for, come to such a disasterous end.  Jill Kinmont was a great skier and slated for the olympics until she dived off a mountain leaving her paralyzed from the chest down.  She is a very brave person and I have great admiration for all her courage and the way she fought her way back to doing something in life she loved. She had many tragedies in her life, with her boyfriend deserting her after the accident, and the boy she later loved getting killed in a plane accident, and the Father she adored dying.  Thank goodness she had a wonderful Mother willing to care for her completely and she had her job cut out for her.  She required a lot of care.Timothy Bottoms came on the scene and it was almost love at first sight for both of them.  How many men in the world would want that kind of responsibility?  Yet, he did!  It would take someone very special and obviously he is.  She was fortunate enough to have had two men love her like that.  I thought this was a wonderful movie and knowing it is a true story makes it even more special.  I will watch it over and over and recommend it highly to anyone.",5,A wonderfully heartfelt movie,997142400,"08 7, 2001",2001,1293,"['have', 'seen', 'movies', 'course', 'quot', 'Other', 'Side', 'Mountain', 'quot', 'one', 'always', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'young', 'life', 'peak', 'dream', 'have', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'come', 'disasterous', 'end', 'Jill', 'Kinmont', 'was', 'great', 'skier', 'slated', 'olympics', 'dived', 'off', 'mountain', 'leaving', 'paralyzed', 'chest', 'down', 'very', 'brave', 'person', 'have', 'great', 'admiration', 'courage', 'way', 'fought', 'way', 'back', 'doing', 'something', 'life', 'loved', 'had', 'many', 'tragedies', 'life', 'boyfriend', 'deserting', 'accident', 'boy', 'later', 'loved', 'getting', 'killed', 'plane', 'accident', 'Father', 'adored', 'dying', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'had', 'wonderful', 'Mother', 'willing', 'care', 'completely', 'had', 'job', 'cut', 'out', 'required', 'lot', 'care.Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'came', 'scene', 'was', 'almost', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'How', 'many', 'men', 'world', 'would', 'want', 'kind', 'responsibility', 'Yet', 'did', 'would', 'take', 'someone', 'very', 'special', 'obviously', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'have', 'had', 'two', 'men', 'love', 'thought', 'was', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'knowing', 'true', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'special', 'will', 'watch', 'recommend', 'highly', 'anyone']","The Other Side of Mountain, Part 2 VHS  1978"
200735,A3TXLUS98BJXWL,630018207X,Mary Hope Doran,"[0, 0]","This movie was a really good movie. It is the continuing true story of Jill Kinmont the Olympic hopeful in skiing who had a tragic accident that left her alive but with so many challenges to meet afterward. She finds her way in the world through teaching and in meeting her husband-to-be John Boothe. This sequel is mainly about her courtship, romance and eventual marriage to John. Marilyn Hassett and Timothy Bottoms do great jobs portraying Jill and John. It is very moving inspiring and real. REAL LOVE does happen for some people in this life and this couple found it with each other. Jill's mother has always been Jill's caretaker so John must learn how to take on that responsibility. Jill has some serious emotional challenges to work through before she can marry John. In the end they marry and are now livivg in Bishop California where they both grew up.
