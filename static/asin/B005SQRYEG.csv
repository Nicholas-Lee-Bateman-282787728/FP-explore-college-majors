1502645,A285W3N2KHGII1,B005SQRYEG,Andrew Greimann,"[0, 0]","Most of the time, the four and five-star reviews triumph when movies are released, because the lower ratings are written with little effort at times, or can just be over getting a bad connection/DVD. In this case, I really wanted to honestly critique this from several points of view that I think everyone should read, and also to give the movie's story quickly for anyone considering the movie.Story----------------------------------------In a quick synopsis, this is a fictional film, or as far as I can tell--I may be wrong on this. The coach for the &#34;River Rats&#34; baseball team needs to hire a new pitcher, as his team has been performing poorly. He is sent out into the country by the manager to find a prospective player, but his car gets stuck in the ditch and he discovers &#34;Mickey&#34;, a young man who fast-throws apples to mash them for his family's pigs on the farm (as their pigs like eating the apples that way, according to the movie). The coach is impressed with Mickey, though he discovers Mickey has Asperger's, and convinces his parents to let him play. At first, Mickey has trouble with pitching during training and gets his shoes nailed to the bench by the former pitcher, but quickly becomes a star for the team. Eventually, the former pitcher uses his girlfriend to lure Mickey into a trap, where he gets beat up badly enough he can't pitch for a while. The other pitcher quickly becomes good at Mickey's position, and his girlfriend confessed to being an accomplice at the night of Mickey's assault. Eventually, Mickey pitches once again, and is restored to his position from scorekeeper once he recovers. The parents come right before the final game, and are about to take Mickey home over what happened, when the coach confronts his father and Mickey makes the choice to finish. Finally, the movie ends with a successful final game, and Mickey comes back home with his father, (who now is playing catch with the baseball).Review----------------------------------------As with &#34;Adam&#34;, I decided to watch a few movies in this genre to discover more about it and learn as much as I could. The movie's storyline is simple, but almost too simple. There aren't real challenges shown that Mickey has to live with, and when trying to introduce people to this genre, it is completely unrealistic, which is why I will give this film two stars.- Where is the sense of reality? The parents mention that Mickey needs structure, and the mother asks the coach if &#34;he's had one of his moments&#34;, but every single time, he conveniently solves situations in the film, and there is not once where we have a meltdown, shutdown, or even a serious problem with something--which I believe someone with HFA/AS will encounter at least once. The loudspeakers and crowd, for example, could easily be a potential problem to someone with ASD, not because of mere choice, but because it can be physically taxing/painful on the nervous system, or otherwise incredibly stressful to endure (think of fight-or-flight and double it). The movie doesn't really explain this. The red mark being removed in the glove is also a scene that went too quickly, and should have received more attention... but it didn't. However, the part that was the hardest to watch was when the shoes were nailed to the bench and Mickey ripped the soles off, mentioning it was a problem that he did so. In a real situation, that most likely would have led to a meltdown if he considered it a serious enough issue--but the movie resolves this within literally less than a minute. Deciding to go to the party was also a quick situation, but in everything, in giving the filmmakers credit, no two people with an ASD are the same, and most likely, Mickey could have been simply reflecting a really mild case, which may be why these oversights exist.- Mickey is counting throughout the movie. I would have no problem with this, except that it has been a stereotype which has lingered for the last several decades. While there definitely are calculating savants, and perhaps the character Mickey in this movie was had savant skills, not everyone who has autism, whether mild or severe, will be a savant--and not all savants have an ASD, either. The movie also could have chosen a different area to demonstrate this, such as simulation of real-life objects, eclectic memory and recall, or information retrieval--but this is never mentioned, and thus, the un-informed viewer could easily correlate ASD = counting once again as in &#34;Rain Man&#34;.- &#34;He is mentally disabled, sir!&#34; was one line in the movie. I think hearing this said was worth removing one star alone--otherwise, I would have given the film four for an effort at a tough genre. The truth is that someone having an ASD does not mean retardation, as people used to think in previous generations. Rather, as a spectrum, it can range from an individual having a tinge of mental retardation to genius-level intelligence, and it was not fair for this judgment to be made in this film using Asperger's as the only criterion for this statement. We do not know the character Mickey's intelligence that well in the movie, with the exception of the scene where the coach speaks with his mother, and she mentions his school life and abilities.We are given flashback scenes of Mickey hiding under the table, but we are not given much else outside of the baseball storyline. The movie moves quickly, while accidentally forgetting critical details needed for such a movie, and from the cliche-title of &#34;in his shoes&#34;, I was quite literally expecting the movie to show the games through the vision and life of the character. Instead, it was centered around the baseball story, not the sight of the character. Perhaps, it was because of the title that this expectation was there.In summary, however, if you are looking for a good movie to watch on the weekend, it is definitely a well-done and clean Christian movie (despite a review that I read, which I find exaggerated--though there is one party scene) and it does have a good storyline, despite its faults.However, if you are looking to better understand autism, this is not the movie to watch, as I think it does a rather bad job of doing so. &#34;Adam&#34; actually would be better suited for understanding Asperger's, with much more dedication throughout. As one extra note, for those truly interested in learning more, I would watch Temple Grandin, &#34;The Autistic Me&#34; by BBC, the two-part episode on autism as part of a television series by Joni, or real-life situations to research the entire spectrum accurately, as well as reading people's personal experiences and posts from Wrong Planet or biographical books, the pages by Mayo Clinic and other respectable/reliable sources (and not the quackery that thrives on the Internet on this subject).And, lastly, but certainly not least, I will credit this movie with all my heart for focusing on a young adult character, and not a little child, as I think it takes a much bolder person to address and present an adult than a defenseless child. After watching this film, I truly do think it delivers an effort to be more understanding and to present a new approach on this subject, regardless of the areas where it lacks. Thanks for reading this long review, and please mark it as helpful, if you found it helpful to you.",3,"Good movie, simple storyline, bad look at AS",1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,7385,"['Most',

1502646,A2MXDO1Q67U46W,B005SQRYEG,bassgiraffe,"[3, 3]","I'm not one to watch and like sports related movies but ""A Mile in His Shoes"" really touched my heart. it's about a baseball team that is struggling to make it, when the coach is asked to travel somewhere to recruit a new player he has some car issues and stops at a farm. There he meets this boy with an amazing arm. His parents are reluctant to let him go join this team because he has aspergers. They don't want to see him get hurt like he had been all his live. He does join and the team becomes the talk of the State.While watching this movie, I kept hoping that Mickey wont get hurt or picked on. I found myself cheering him on and crying when his teammate were so supportive of his aspergers.I don't know much about aspergers, so I can't say if the actor was believable or not. But I can say Luke Schroder made his character lovable.This movie will make you laugh, cry, get mad and smile. This is one we will be keeping on our shelves for a long time. I can't wait to watch it with my kids. The only thing I could have done without was the country music. But that's just a personal preference, I know a lot of people who would love it.I would totally recommend this movie for all ages.

It was enjoyable to watch the support Cain and most of the teammates gave the young man with Asperger's.  It was painful to watch the stupidity and outright meanness of teammates, one in particular, who did not support him.  I hate bullies, and this one was the worst kind.  I might have rated the film a 4 if the young man's Autism had been more completely portrayed.  I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I noticed that Shroeder's character always made eye contact with those he talked with.  I've worked as a one-on-one teacher's aide with boys with Asperger's for a few years now and the boys I spend time with rarely make eye contact.  Even when you lift their chins and tell them to look at your eyes, they always look slightly off to the side, avoiding your eyes.  There may be exceptions to the rule, but I feel that if you're going to make a film focused on a character with Autism, that character should be an example of the norm, not the exception.  I also feel that the movie did not display the characteristic ""tunnel vision"" or narrow focus aspect of Asperger's/Autism as a dominant aspect of the young man's nature.",3,Love baseball movies.

I wasn't disappointed.""A Mile in His Shoes"" stars Dean Cain as a minor league baseball coach named nicknamed ""Murph."" Murph enjoys his job, but can't quite shake the losing streak his team has been experiencing lately. When Murph goes in search of a possible recruit, he accidentally runs his car off the road and becomes stranded on a country highway. A young man named Mickey offers him the use of his family's phone. Murph takes Mickey up on his offer, and that's when Murph discovers something amazing - Mickey's pitching arm could be just the thing needed to end Murph's team's losing streak.There's only one problem - Mickey has Asperger's Syndrome (a form of Autism), and as such, his parents (especially his dad) are very protective of him. Can Murph convince Mickey's parents to allow their son the chance of a lifetime? And if Mickey's parents do agree, how will Mickey fit in with the rest of the team? How will he adapt to life away from his family's farm - the only life he's ever known?This movie has wonderful discussion points including the topics of faith, loyalty, friendship, never giving up,  envy, mistreatment of others because they are different, grief, worry, and telling the truth.A word of caution to those with young children: there is a brief scene at a party where Mickey is injured that will scare younger viewers.Beautiful scenery, an inspiring story line based on a true story, and a well-rounded family movie make this a must-see.

Based on a true story, Dean Cain and Luke Schroder star in movie based on the book, The Legend of Mickey Tussler.A Mile In His Shoes tells the story of a failing baseball coach Arthur Murphy (Dean Cain) who is trying to find a way to salvage his minor league teach, The River Rats. Taking a drive to interview a prospective candidate who may just turn out to be the next big thing, Murphy has a minor accident while trying to find his way into town. When he seeks the aid from a young boy, Mickey Tussler searching for his lost pig, Oscar  to use a phone, he soon discovers God has bigger plans in store for Murphy and Tussler.Watching Tussler 'smash apples' as he's feeding the pigs, Murphy discovers the boy can deliver the heat in his accurate pitches to throw apples into a tin barrel. Sensing a bright spot in both their lives, Murphy must convince the Tussler family of Mickey's potential at pitching baseball. However he discovers that Mickey has Asperger's syndrome, which is a form of autism that can overwhelm his sense if he is surprised or confused. They relent to allow Mickey to try out and soon discover that all roads lead to where God will call those who are willing to listen.I received this DVD, A Mile in His Shoes compliments of Propeller, Thomas Kinkade and Nasser Group North for my honest review. This was is sure to be a homerun for fans of baseball, under dog stories of determination and the love of friendship and family and is also a movie from the director of Angels in the Outfield.

Coach Murphy, played well by Dean Cain, is sent to find a baseball prospect and stumbles across a natural pitching phenomenon who incidentally also has Aspberger's Syndrome (a type of Autism).  ""Murph"" encourages the young man, Tyler, to come and play with his team, where he finds rapid pitching success and general acceptance from his team (with jealousy from one teammate).  Tyler does struggle with dealing with the world as a whole, and his protective father attempts to shelter him from harm.  However Tyler overcomes his situation and performs very well.Production is limited, and other than Dean Cain there were no recognizable actors.  In many ways I felt as though I was watching a film on Hallmark or another tv channel.However the film has a great message, with the redemption and success of Tyler, Coach Murphy, the father and others.

While on a trip to find a hot prospect ""Murph"" gets stuck in a ditch outside of a farm.  While waiting for a tow he sees Micky throwing apples and sees what he is looking for.  I have said this before...I am a sucker for all sports movies.  There has been a long string of sports movies lately that I have really enjoyed.  It stopped here.  While this is not a terrible movie it has the same problem that a lot of family movies have lately.  I know that it has to be this way because it is a family movie but it seems like there is no push back against the ""good guys"" at all.  For example : Murph sees Micky...he has no pitching mechanics...he says I'll work with him...paint's a red dot on a glove...Micky is now best pitcher ever.  To me when a movie is unbelievable it's not good to me.  Overall, not a bad movie, but too unbelievable for me to fully enjoy.

The main actors are Dean Cain and Luke Schroder. This is the first movie I've seen Luke Schroder play in and thought what a marvelous story. This movie was based on the book ""The Legend of Mickey Tussler.""Mickey has Asperger's Syndrome and Luke does a wonderful job of portraying a boy with this syndrome. He is quiet and really is respectful of this syndrome and doesn't make it seem dumb or stupid.I like how the team doesn't give up even when they are losing and neither does Mickey. It is really hard for Mickey to keep himself from being to overwhelmed, but with help and his own determination he does it.Of course you have your bully's in this movie as you do in real life and I really liked how this movie ended and the faith and love Mickey had to do the right thing.This is a very enjoyable movie that is very family friendly and would be an excellent addition to your library.
