If you insist on nitpicking, then obviously you're not going to enjoy it -- but if you can suspend your disbelief, then you may find it to be a fairly entertaining show.However, be aware that Season 2 requires a bit *more* of an effort to swallow than Season 1 did. While some of the stories are noticeably sillier, the main reason it's harder to swallow is the addition of the ""H.G. Wells"" character. The notion that the historical H.G. Wells was ""really"" a woman -- Helena -- who allowed her brother to take the credit for Wells' writing...? I'm sorry, but that's just asinine. And the suggestion that she had to do this because Society allegedly refused to accept a woman as a writer is laughably stupid. It's not merely an annoying and pointless rewrite of History, but also patently false. Women may not have been entirely ""liberated"" yet, but there were already *many* female writers in that time period, and there would have been no reason at all for a female H.G. Wells to hide her identity and pretend to be a man just to get printed. So listening to the ""Helena Wells"" character prattle about the non-existent discrimination she faced is a real eye roller.It's also, unfortunately, symptomatic of a general lowering of the quality of the writing. Where Season 1 was fairly imaginative and fun, Season 2 is mostly just More Of The Same -- with the annoying ""Helena Wells"" character thrown into the mix, for whatever absurd reason the producers thought she was necessary. (Perhaps because she's pretty?)Mind you, the show is still worth watching, particularly if you like the characters of Pete and Myka. But if you're like me, you'll soon find yourself getting a bit restless, and wishing that they'd use Claudia and Leena more often -- and that they'd either *gag* the annoying ""Helena Wells"" character, or just get rid of her entirely.",3,Moderately Fun,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,1944,"['SF', 'Warehouse', '13', 'active', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'order', 'appreciate', 'insist', 'nitpicking', 'then', 'obviously', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'enjoy', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'then', 'may', 'find', 'be', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'show.However', 'be', 'aware', 'Season', '2', 'bit', '*more*', 'effort', 'swallow', 'Season', '1', 'did', 'stories', 'are', 'noticeably', 'sillier', 'main', 'reason', 'harder', 'swallow', 'addition', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'character', 'notion', 'historical', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'was', 'really', 'woman', 'Helena', 'who', 'allowed', 'brother', 'take', 'credit', 'Wells', 'writing', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', 'asinine', 'suggestion', 'had', 'do', 'Society', 'allegedly', 'refused', 'accept', 'woman', 'writer', 'laughably', 'stupid', 'not', 'merely', 'annoying', 'pointless', 'rewrite', 'History', 'also', 'patently', 'false', 'Women', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'entirely', 'liberated', 'yet', 'were', 'already', '*many*', 'female', 'writers', 'time', 'period', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'reason', 'female', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'hide', 'identity', 'pretend', 'be', 'man', 'just', 'get', 'printed', 'So', 'listening', 'Helena', 'Wells', 'character', 'prattle', 'non-existent', 'discrimination', 'faced', 'real', 'eye', 'roller.It', 'also', 'unfortunately', 'symptomatic', 'general', 'lowering', 'quality', 'writing', 'Where', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'fairly', 'imaginative', 'fun', 'Season', '2', 'mostly', 'just', 'More', 'Same', 'annoying', 'Helena', 'Wells', 'character', 'thrown', 'mix', 'absurd', 'reason', 'producers', 'thought', 'was', 'necessary', 'Perhaps', 'pretty', 'show', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'particularly', 'like', 'characters', 'Pete', 'Myka', ""'re"", ""'ll"", 'soon', 'find', 'getting', 'bit', 'restless', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'use', 'Claudia', 'Leena', 'more', 'often', ""'d"", '*gag*', 'annoying', 'Helena', 'Wells', 'character', 'just', 'get', 'rid', 'entirely']",N/A

After an explosive opening (literally) ""Warehouse 13 Season Two"" charges through the season with even more weird artifacts, bizarre problems caused by them, and a clever new character joining the cast. It has some wobbles early on, but is still lots of fun.After Artie (Saul Rubinek) is unceremoniously resurrected, the agents find that MacPherson has escaped the Warehouse -- and he took a newly-debronzed H.G. Wells along for the ride. While Archie races to Europe to find Claudia (Allison Scagliotti), Pete (Eddie McClintock) and Myka (Joanne Kelly) try to figure out what MacPherson want from H.G. Wells... but they haven't reckoned with their new enemy's skills.And they have a lot of other artifacts to investigate -- a vigilante superhero, mysterious holograms, supermodels aging into crones, a computer that takes over the Warehouse, spontaneous combustion on a wrestling team, Pete's delusions about a conspiracy among the Regents, body-swapping, time-traveling to the 1960s, and a mysterious Russian enemy out to kill Artie. And finally, an ancient Warehouse is unexpectedly reactivated, leading to what may be Pete and Myka's most dangerous mission yet.""Warehouse 13's"" second season is a bit wobbly in the first half, since a few of the episodes are a bit silly (Claudia and Leena having a ""victim-off""!). We've still got weird artifacts all over the place, including Mata Hari's stockings, Harriet Tubman's thimble, a steampunk vest, the sword Excalibur and stones from the Tower of Babel. Ah, it's a fun concept.The stories here are a fun blend of action (shootout in a wrecking yard!), sci-fi and comedy (""You, sir, have been growing back your appendix in an attempt to get Vanessa to visit the warehouse...that's so romantic!""), and some mildly surprising twists. But there are some hints that something sinister is on the horizon, and that MacPherson was just the tip of the iceberg.McClintock and Kelly make a fun team -- Pete is still too goofy, but McClintock gets to show his wilder, darker side when Pete briefly goes in sane ""Around The Bend,"" while Kelly gets to prance around in fluffy slippers with a stuffed animal. Scagliotti remains the punky little sister figure, but sadly Genelle Williams is as wooden as ever... and she loses ALL her eerie mystique.But Rubinek is still the center of the story as the grumpy, crusty curmudgeon with a heart of gold (especially when we find out why he helped the Soviet-era Russians).

My thought going into this season was that this show was still shy of a truly compelling story arc to really propel it over the top. However, the two-part finale to this Season 2 delivers big. I have friends who put down WAREHOUSE 13 because they think it's too addicted to the goofy and lighthearted structure, but it's just one more element that I like about the show. SANCTUARY, for example, is a bit too stuffy. Like my friends.Remember last season when Myka Bering was introduced as this driven, tightly wound Secret Service operative? Maybe the biggest discrepancy - this season versus the last - is that Myka has loosened up so much that she's practically a clone of Pete in terms of kooky lightheartedness. Not that I'm complaining. I actually like this shift in character, and there are moments enough in which she reverts back to her intense persona. Conversely, carefree Pete Lattimer gets a crack at romantic stability (and, dammit, it's not with Myka).WAREHOUSE 13's hook is irresistible for fans of sci-fi & fantasy, and it's a wide umbrella of a hook that lends potential for the plot to go pretty much anywhere. It's a neat mash-up of THE X-FILES and Indiana Jones, THE LOST ROOM mini-series and TNT's The Librarian movies, and someone somewhere even threw in a MOONLIGHTING reference. And for the seven people who aren't aware of the premise, it's like this: Two squabbling Secret Service agents save the President's life and are re-assigned to Warehouse 13, an off-the-grid storage facility somewhere in the remote wastelands of South Dakota. Warehouse 13 stores and safeguards supernatural (and often dangerous) artifacts procured by the U.S. government, now procured by these two agents, Myka and Pete.Exit the villain of last season, James MacPherson, as he makes way for the enigmatic H.G. Wells, once a Warehouse agent gone rogue. Who, in a neat twist, turns out to be a woman (well played by Jaime Murray) and still tortured by the murder of her young daughter. The guessing game, for most of the season, centers around H.G.'s obscured agenda. Her recurring appearances lend welcome suspense to the episodes she's in; Murray adds a different energy to the cast dynamics. Pete initially seems smitten with her. Myka trusts her. Artie smells something rotten. So who's right? Season 2 further expands the show's mythology (I dig the Escher Vault!), but never more so than in the final story arc (""Buried"" and ""Reset"") which introduces the long lost Warehouse 2, which had been buried for thousands of years in Egypt. This arc also hints at what possibly lies in store for the Warehouse's resident teen tech support Claudia Donovan. And, finally, we find out what's what with H.G. Wells. Oh, and we learn the nature of the world's first ever weapon of mass destruction.I've got several favorite episodes. ""Mild Mannered"" - introducing the mysterious vigilante Iron Shadow and featuring Jack Kirby's belt as the artifact - not only is WAREHOUSE 13's nod to the superhero genre but it also features a FIREFLY mini-reunion with guest-stars Sean Maher and Jewel Staite. And I love that Pete is such a comic book geek. ""13.1"" is the crossover with EUREKA. It has Douglas Fargo visiting Warehouse 13 to upgrade its computer system, but since this is Fargo, the fit promptly hits the shan. Now ""Around the Bend,"" if it only had the guts to follow thru, would have been a hellacious episode rife with grave ramifications. However, the plot's resolution opts to go the Newhart route, and that's disappointing. ""Merge with Caution"" is the fun Myka/Pete body-swapping episode, and I don't have to say anything more than that, right? ""Where and When"" is a marvelous time travel story that catapults the agents to 1961 to solve a murder case. It also reintroduces a former Warehouse operative (from Season 1's ""Burnout""). And, of course, the terrific two-part finale ""Buried"" and ""Reset"" (loved the bits about Daedalus's wings and ""Jerusalem Jones""). Season 2 actually closes with ""Secret Santa,"" the tepid holiday episode in which they really went overboard with the frivolous ""artifact."" Not that this episode is in this Season 2 collection.Still have some reservations: Once in a while the show does suffer from feeble execution, but that probably has more to do with the weaker scripts. And while I've been pimping the premise, the downside to showcasing these supernatural artifacts is that there's a tendency to use them as the deus ex machina that resolves the plot. There's a danger of going to that well too often. Saul Rubinek, by virtue of being Saul Rubinek, is not easy to like, and I'm rendered indifferent whenever his character Artie is featured. For those who do like Artie, more is learned about his shady past in the episode ""Vendetta."" However, I do like his scenes with Claudia Donovan, giving us a stage for the bitter curmudgeon and the sassy teenager who looks up to him. For me, though, it's all about Myka and Pete and that bantery thing they got going. Oh, and I likes the Farnsworth and the Tesla gun, too... these devices just smack of steampunk.WAREHOUSE 13 - SEASON TWO contains 12 episodes on 3 discs. Bonus stuff goes like this:- cast & crew audio commentary on 3 episodes (""Time Will Tell,"" ""Merge with Caution,"" & ""Reset"")- Deleted Scenes from 10 episodes (basically, only ""Beyond Our Control"" and ""Buried"" don't have deleted scenes)- gag reel (00:03:15 minutes long)- ""A Thrilleromedy - the cast and crew discuss the evolution of the show and expand on the relationships of the characters"" (00:07:33 minutes)- ""A Stitch in Time - Get to know the team's unexpected new nemesis, the time-traveling H.G.

One improvement is a better integration of the Claudia character into the series, and the nice relationship formed with irascible Artie.  Focusing more on the character's personal dramas wasn't especially significant, and many of the episodes were almost like parodies of the series itself.  The ""crossover"" with fellow SyFy series EUREKA was merely a ratings ploy and acted as a romantic tryst for Claudia and EUREKA's resident nerd.The artifacts this season:  underwear (?!) that transform a normal guy into a dangerous super-hero; a device that makes TV characters come to life; an artifact that ages supermodels into elderly hags; a deadly energy drink that's killing wrestlers; HG Wells time machine; a former warehouse in Egypt; and a deadly trident in the uber-villain's clutches.  The cast tries gamely but are sometimes hampered by the oiverly contrived subplots.  Saul Rubinek and Allison Scagliotti play off each other well; Jaime Murray (once DEXTER's foe) has a nice accent but making her HG Wells isn't totally plausible; Paula Garces as Pete's love interest bombs; CCH Pounder is like a live cartoon character in a monotonous role; Genelle Williams as Lila is basically superfluous.  That leaves Eddie McCormack and Joanne Kelly as Pete and Myka who banter playfully and rescue each other from various artifacts.  I got tired of this after the first couple of episodes and found them harder and harder to believe.Yes, this is fantasy and the premise of some of the artifacts intriguing.  But the FX are fairly pedestrian and the erratic pacing made me feel uninvolved.Will Myka return for Season 3?

While I wasn't crazy about the first season, season 2 starts strong and gets more interesting and fun with every episode.Season 2 starts with a strong plot line, lots of action, and quite a bit of comic relief. The main plot remains the same, ie the team trying to locate an artifact that is playing havoc with reality...or, well, killing people. In season 2  there  are finally unifying story lines that connect the episodes, leaving us wanting to see the next piece of the puzzle. The writers have also done a brilliant job of developing the characters and making them feel like a really fun dysfunctional family.While I have trouble seeing Agent Lattimer as a secrete service agent his character adds fun, silliness, and life to the show. I'm glad that they didn't pair agents Lattimer and Bering romantically. Their chemistry works as friends but would probably fizzle as a romance. It also gives the show more room to grow if they aren't romantically attached. The writers do a good job playing with subplots as the agents try to maintain romantic relationships outside of work. I especially like when Agent Lattimer was spending the day in bed with his new girlfriend and a crisis had him not only scurrying into work but locking her out of the room 1/2 dressed...did I mention their cover story is that they are IRS agents, what type of life or death crisis's can an IRS agent have.The addition of Jamie Murray playing HG Wells has made the show much more interesting and fun.

It took everything that you loved from season 1 and made it even better. All of the main characters seemed to grow a lot over the course of the season and become even that more likable or in some cases hated. Claudia had more of the spotlight this season as her character began to really mature into more of an adult but not too much as to ruin that curious spirit she's always had. She even got a love interest this season which helped to create some great depth to her character. As for Pete and Myka they both seemed to grow out of their shells, and be just more fun especially when they banter back and forth on a mission. They really remind me of Shawn and Gus on Psych how they have a palpable chemistry that makes them perfect partners.Also the missions themselves seemed more exciting and outrageous this season and made the show a lot more fun. A new character joined the cast as well to spice things up. I won't ruin who that is but let's just say that you go back and forth on who she's working for as the season progresses. Overall Warehouse 13's second season was phenomenal as the characters were just so much more interesting as the writers and actors have figured out these people that they want to portray.

Introducing these criminal masterminds always leaves me cold -- but I'm sure it appeals to the majority of viewers, because this theme is nearly omnipresent in television (see, for instance: Burn Notice, CSI Miami, Bones, Criminal Minds, among many others).
