982167,A26PEFWHKUHN7O,B000F3UACU,Captain Insanity,"[10, 13]","The Masters of Horror Series has a tendency to over-emphasize the ""Master"" part.  While Lucky McKee may be well on his way to entering that hall, he is by no means a master.  But at the very least, he does direct horror movies.  (When did half these guys become ""Masters of Horror""?  Was I Sleeping?)Anyway I loved his first movie ""May"" but never saw his second one ""The Woods""  So I went into this flick with almost no expectations what-so-ever. And what I got was a lesbian love story with a 6-legged twist.  The best way I can descibe it is if ""David Cronenberg"" directed an episode of ""Tales from the Crypt"".There's relatively no blood in this film.  (Something I generally need in a horror movie) And yet suprisingly I wasn't disappointed.  The acting was pretty convincing. (Which I think was a good distraction from the lack of gore.) Misty Mundae played the childish, fast-talking, artist Misty, and Angela Bettis seemed at home as the ""stiff as a stiff"" entimologist Ida Teeter.  They did such a good job with their roles, they actually forced me to like the characters.  Even the supporting cast was enjoyable.The plot was straight foward.  Lesbian gets a bug in the mail; Lesbian falls in love; Bug bites Lesbians Lover; Lover becomes impregnated with bugs love children and as a result completely flips out of her brain cell.All in all, it was a quick story, with good pacing, a few gross out scenes to drive it along, believable acting, hokey yet enjoyable special effects, (I don't know if I mentioned naked lesbians, or not), a hilarious scene in a chinese restaurant, all ultimately leading to its metamorphic ending, which will disappoint some but please most.1 Star for the pace1 for the characters (What can I say? I Love Lesbians)1 for the gross-out factor,(Her ear, the pillow, and finally the metamophisis) and1 Star for the twists & turns(o.k. so there's only 1 or 2 minor twists;but this flick deserves a 4th star because its definitlybetter than average)MORAL OF THE STORY:  Safe Sex means Checking your Pillowsfor Man-Eating Bugs",4,The Day The Insect  Stole My Lesbian,1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,2055,"['Masters', 'Horror', 'Series', 'tendency', 'over-emphasize', 'Master', 'part', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'may', 'be', 'well', 'way', 'entering', 'hall', 'master', 'very', 'least', 'direct', 'horror', 'movies', 'When', 'did', 'guys', 'become', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'Was', 'Sleeping', 'Anyway', 'loved', 'first', 'movie', 'May', 'never', 'saw', 'second', 'one', 'Woods', 'went', 'flick', 'almost', 'expectations', 'what-so-ever', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'lesbian', 'love', 'story', '6-legged', 'twist', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'descibe', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'directed', 'episode', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'relatively', 'blood', 'film', 'Something', 'generally', 'need', 'horror', 'movie', 'yet', 'suprisingly', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'Which', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'distraction', 'lack', 'gore', 'Misty', 'Mundae', 'played', 'childish', 'fast-talking', 'artist', 'Misty', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'seemed', 'home', 'stiff', 'stiff', 'entimologist', 'Ida', 'Teeter', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'roles', 'actually', 'forced', 'like', 'characters', 'Even', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'enjoyable.The', 'plot', 'was', 'straight', 'foward', 'Lesbian', 'bug', 'mail', 'Lesbian', 'love', 'Bug', 'Lesbians', 'Lover', 'Lover', 'impregnated', 'bugs', 'love', 'children', 'result', 'completely', 'brain', 'cell.All', 'was', 'quick', 'story', 'good', 'pacing', 'few', 'gross', 'scenes', 'drive', 'along', 'believable', 'acting', 'hokey', 'yet', 'enjoyable', 'special', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'mentioned', 'naked', 'lesbians', 'not', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'chinese', 'restaurant', 'ultimately', 'leading', 'metamorphic', 'ending', 'will', 'disappoint', 'please', 'most.1', 'Star', 'pace1', 'characters', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'Love', 'Lesbians', '1', 'gross-out', 'factor', 'ear', 'pillow', 'finally', 'metamophisis', 'Star', 'twists', 'turns', 'o.k', 'only', '1', '2', 'minor', 'twists', 'flick', '4th', 'star', 'definitlybetter', 'average', 'MORAL', 'THE', 'STORY', 'Safe', 'Sex', 'Checking', 'Pillowsfor', 'Man-Eating', 'Bugs']",Sick Girl masters Of Horror

982170,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B000F3UACU,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 0]","Although this entry in the ""Masters of Horror"" series is very light on chills, it followed the formula of other installments from Season 1- Deer Woman, Pick Me Up, Haeckel's Tale, Dance of the Dead etc and it delivered on being goofy. Argento's ""Jenifer"" differed in that it counteracted it with insanely grotesque and disturbing moments, this one, is surprisingly mild. If the gratuitous bare breast scenes were omitted, ""Sick Girl"" could have been a PG-13 rated Sci-Fi comedy that may please some but infuriate those who are in need of thrills, chills and graphic horror. With that sad, this quirky entry is highly watchable thanks largely to the over the top performance of Angela Bettis who plays a gentle but nerdy entomologist who is in search of love and just when the perfect girl (Erin Brown) enters her life, a mysterious insect (who was sent to her via mysterious circumstances from Brazil) infects the girlfriend thus jeopardizing the relationship and their very lives. There are a few moments of slimy gore and the climax is decent enough however more was needed to make this truly frightening. I will admit, I am not familiar with Lucky McKee's work. Maybe if I had watched some of his previous work, I would have known what to expect from this. As I already mentioned, Bettis' performance is what kept me entertained. She puts everything she has into her peculiar character in need of love and acceptance and her quirky accent and tone just adds to the fun factor. Brown's performance is not as memorable but she isn't bad either and it's not her fault her character is a little lackluster however since she does become the insects feeding ground, she has the opportunity to make her character a bit more interesting and she does.""Sick Girl"" is a twisted mix of Sci-Fi and comedy with little to no suspense and no real scares. It does offer some mild gore, insect FX and mutations, truly ridiculous characters and a love triangle involving an unlikely threesome. It may not scare you the way you expected but you may find yourself being entertained regardless. Not the best of the series but not the worst either and if you are a fan of Angela Bettis, you definitely want to give this odd little love story a try.",3,"Sick Girl is Sick, Twisted, Entertaining but Not Scary",1257897600,"11 11, 2009",2009,2228,"['entry', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'series', 'very', 'light', 'chills', 'followed', 'formula', 'other', 'installments', 'Season', '1-', 'Deer', 'Woman', 'Pick', 'Me', 'Up', 'Haeckel', 'Tale', 'Dance', 'Dead', 'etc', 'delivered', 'being', 'goofy', 'Argento', 'Jenifer', 'differed', 'counteracted', 'insanely', 'grotesque', 'disturbing', 'moments', 'one', 'surprisingly', 'mild', 'gratuitous', 'bare', 'breast', 'scenes', 'were', 'omitted', 'Sick', 'Girl', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'Sci-Fi', 'comedy', 'may', 'please', 'infuriate', 'who', 'are', 'need', 'thrills', 'chills', 'graphic', 'horror', 'sad', 'quirky', 'entry', 'highly', 'watchable', 'thanks', 'largely', 'top', 'performance', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'who', 'gentle', 'nerdy', 'entomologist', 'who', 'search', 'love', 'just', 'when', 'perfect', 'girl', 'Erin', 'Brown', 'life', 'mysterious', 'insect', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'Brazil', 'girlfriend', 'thus', 'jeopardizing', 'relationship', 'very', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'slimy', 'gore', 'climax', 'decent', 'enough', 'however', 'more', 'was', 'needed', 'make', 'truly', 'frightening', 'will', 'admit', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'work', 'Maybe', 'had', 'watched', 'previous', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'what', 'expect', 'already', 'mentioned', 'Bettis', 'performance', 'what', 'kept', 'entertained', 'everything', 'peculiar', 'character', 'need', 'love', 'acceptance', 'quirky', 'accent', 'tone', 'just', 'fun', 'factor', 'Brown', 'performance', 'not', 'memorable', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'not', 'fault', 'character', 'little', 'lackluster', 'however', 'become', 'insects', 'feeding', 'ground', 'opportunity', 'make', 'character', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'Sick', 'Girl', 'twisted', 'mix', 'Sci-Fi', 'comedy', 'little', 'suspense', 'real', 'scares', 'offer', 'mild', 'gore', 'insect', 'FX', 'mutations', 'truly', 'ridiculous', 'characters', 'love', 'triangle', 'involving', 'unlikely', 'threesome', 'may', 'not', 'scare', 'way', 'expected', 'may', 'find', 'being', 'entertained', 'regardless', 'Not', 'best', 'series', 'not', 'worst', 'are', 'fan', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'definitely', 'want', 'give', 'odd', 'little', 'love', 'story', 'try']",Sick Girl masters Of Horror

A strangely perfect mix of horror, romance and drama. Angela Bettis plays beyond godly in that film. McKee's SICK GIRL is a so-so entry in the series, but you'll most likely see better episodes.Again, you'll meet Angela Bettits who plays Ida, a nerdy entomologist who sexual preference is for the home team. Heartbroken and frustrated that yet another woman has left her because of her love for insects, Ida is hesitant to advance on an equally shy, young woman seems to have a crush on her. Still irked about her love life, Ida returns home one night only to find a mysterious package left on her doorstep. The box contains a peculiar fist-sized insect that instantly intrigues the scientist, as she has never seen such a specimen. Pestered and persuaded by her co-worker Max (Jesse Hllubik) to ask the mystery girl out, Ida eventually proceeds and successfully snags a date from the introverted cutie named Misty, (Erin Brown) after days of parting glances. The awkward tension on their first date is thick enough to slice with a putty knife, and while they do make it to Ida's, the night is relived with some straight-up whisky to loosen the inhibitions.I personally thought Angela Bettis makes a great quirky lead, but her voices was sort of scary. What I mean by that is one moment she sounds feminine and the other times she sounds like a dude.  I fine her to be a great actress who is very poised for an interesting career in independent films. Erin Brown, who is best known for direct-to-video, Seduction Cinema dreck under the name Misty Mundae, actually shows a glimmer of acting ability. While the baby-faced, blue-eyed, jailbait act is cute, she looks better with her shirt on. Fans of the scream queen should be pleased to know, however, that she does have some nudity here. When it boils down to the last act of the picture, it's Bettis who holds her own the best, as Brown can quite pull off the deranged infected wickedness her character goes through by the end. As a couple, the two have an interesting chemistry together, but I don't quite buy the attraction on-screen.Co-scripted by McKee and Sean Hood, SICK GIRL is appropriately billed as a modernized 1950's mutant, big bug monster movie with lesbians.

It seems to be unlike anything currently known and it is unknown who sent it.The bug escapes just as the two women embark on their relationship.  Thing really spark between the two even though they are both unsure just how to proceed.  Then one of them gets bitten by the bug and begins to change emotionally.  But while that happens, the other is unaware of what is going on bug-wise.  But the changes escalate and things start to get a little less idyllic.  Eventually their status in their building becomes affected.  It is at this point that we really start to learn what is really going on and why.This is an interesting film with a good build-up and acting.  The bug is seldom actually seen and we never really get a clear view of it.  But it is the ending that is less than stellar.  After a wonderful start and many tense scenes, the ending is like one of the goofier episodes of Tales From the Crypt (watch it and you will see what I mean).  The film still works but just not in the way one hopes based on the beginning.

Take ""Sick Girl,"" for example.An entomologist who has a bad habit of taking her work home with her loses in her apartment a bizarre Brazilian bug.  This happens at about the same time that she finds an equally bizarre girlfriend.  The two sexy ladies frolick and cavort, but one of them has an encounter with the AWOL insect, an encounter that leaves her ... altered.  What fate lies in store for the lovers?  What will become of the strictly conservative granny-ish landlady?  The lovably sexist coworker?  The adorable little girl in the ladybug costume?This horror-less gem takes an hour to answer these questions, and by the time they're resolved, it's hard to remember why you were ever supposed to care.  Adding to the mix of Reasons Why This Thing Bites is the incompetent acting of our two lesbian leads.  I'll admit I know little about horror veteran Erin Brown, but if her performance here as Misty Falls is any indication, she's very good at moaning, screaming, and looking through her bangs in a sultry, come-hither kind of way.  And that's all she's good at.  Angela Bettis was great in ""May,"" but she performs every scene here with the studied grace of a telephone pole, and she delivers every line as if she just underwent orthodontic surgery.  If those idiosyncracies are meant to be intentional, then I guess at least they're employed with some consistency, but I found them grating.  They are to acting what constipation is to reticence.Worst of all, however, is the tongue-in-cheek attempt of the movie to make a sly little statement about true love, about infidelity and dedication, and about the supernaturally wholesome power of childbirth and rearing.  I'm known for reading too much into things, and I (really really really) don't want to give the MOH overlords any more credit than they're due, but there was so much empty space in the script that they had to fill it with something.  Instead of tension, spookiness, or dread -- y'know, stuff you'd expect in a horror -- there's a lot of pablum about relationships and dating.  It doesn't take much of a leap to see there's a theme at play, and it's as flat and uninspired as every other part of the product.  I'm not saying I disagree with the message (such as it is), but the delivery needs some serious work.

982179,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B000F3UACU,Matthew King,"[3, 7]","This particular episode of Masters of Horror is directed by Lucky McKee, of ""May"" fame.  When McKee was appointed to be a contributor to the series there was some rumblings among the horror contingent.  This is a director, after all who had only contributed one picture to the horror genre so the ""Master"" title seemed a bit of a stretch (Mckee has since directed a second feature film, ""The Woods"", which is currently sitting on the shelf without distribution).  I don't see what the fuss is about.  McKee is an up-and-comer who is clearly devoted to the horror genre.  Eli Roth only has two pictures to his name as well but nobody disputes his place in the genre so let's give McKee a chance...A lesbian entymologist (Angela Bettis) is sent a package from Brazil that contains an insect that is not just your typical bug; slimy tentacles, long spider legs and a set of peering, intense eyes.  One day she accidentally lets the content break loose around her apartment.  Meanwhile our insect-loving girl falls in love with fellow strange girl Misty (Misty Mundae), a sketch artist who hangs around Bettis' workplace.  Eventually Misty ends up sleeping over at Bettis' place, is bit by the bug and all hell breaks loose.Bettis is perfectly cast as the lonely, detached scientist looking for love.  Her quirky gestures and personality traits make her truly an interesting actress to watch.  Witness her talking to her bugs for proof of this.  She lends a certain professionalism and skill to a genre that is certainly not known for great female acting.  Misty Mundae is also great in her role.  Mundae has never been know for great acting of course but she is perfectly cast here in a story involving lesbianism and slimy insects.  And yes Misty fans, she gets buck naked.Mundae and Bettis have a very nervous relationship, which brings an amount of tenderness to this episode.  We truly do care for these characters and feel a deep emotional attachment to them.  That being said, perhaps a little too much time was spent on developing the relationship between the two heroines as there is far more talking throughout this episode than there is chomping (the whole insect-run-amok piece is not unleashed until the final 10 minutes of the flick).  But despite its sedentary nature, ""Sick Girl"" towers above most other episodes in the Masters series due to the strength of its two actresses, the convincing non-CGI bug and the comical absurdity of it all.

982184,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000F3UACU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Masters of Horror: Sick Girl (Lucky McKee, 2006)I've been a fan of the Masters of Horror series for a while, but one of those I've never been able to track down until now is the one I always figured would be my favorite, Sick Girl. Lucky McKee is one of those artists who makes far too few pictures (in fact, if you consider Sick Girl a short--it weighs in at exactly sixty minutes--McKee has directed only three features, and co-directed a fourth, since he burst on the scene in 2001), and since everything he releases is a gem, that can be frustrating. Put McKee and Angela Bettis together and every time, at least so far, the result has been magic. Really, there was no way to go wrong with this. Then I popped it in, once I'd finally gotten my hands on a copy, and I see the name ""Erin Brown"" go by. And I start thinking, ""why does that name sound so familiar?"" And it just wouldn't come to me. Then, a few minutes later, I see one of the most downright beautiful women in all of film, and it's as if someone had wheeled in a huge cake and strippers had jumped out of it, right in my living room: LUCKY MCKEE IS DIRECTING MISTY MUNDAE! (Erin Brown is Mundae's real name.) Misty Mundae, the most beautiful softcore star on the planet! Honestly, I can't even begin to imagine a better definition of ""all's right with the world"" than that.Plot: Ida (Bettis, who teamed up with McKee in May), an attractive but socially awkward entomologist, has just had her most recent girlfriend break up with her because she was ""really creeped out"" by Ivy's menagerie of pet insects. Ida's landlord, Miss Beasley (Marcia Bennett, who's appeared in both of McKee's features since this came out), isn't happy with them either, though her granddaughter Betty (Presumed Dead's Chandra Cain, cute as a button) thinks Ida and her bug collection is the bees' knees, no pun intended. (Betty has a thing for dressing as a ladybug; it's rare you'll see her dressed in anything but a ladybug costume in the entire movie.) In any case, Ida is girlfriend-less, and her jock-macho-chick-obsessed co-worker Max (Jesse Hlubik, another McKee veteran, who most recently teamed up with the director in Red)'s advice isn't helping much. Max does, however, get her to work up the courage to approach the odd, seemingly shy artist who spends her days in the lobby of the building sketching things. While said artist seems just as nervous and socially awkward as Ida, she eventually introduces herself as Misty (Brown), tossing off a self-deprecating ""I'm not a hippie!"" afterwards, and the two of them end up making a dinner date. Magic happens. However, just before magic happens, Ida is sent a mysterious package from Brazil containing a kind of bug she's never seen before. She means to take it into work and have Max take a look at it to see if the two of them can puzzle out what it is, but it gets loose. And, this being a horror flick, it is of course no ordinary bug...As I suspected, it's impossible to go wrong with Lucky McKee. It's even more impossible to go wrong with a juxtaposition of Lucky McKee and Misty Mundae, who despite being known for appearing in bad softcore movies, does have some pretty solid acting chops when pushed to do something with them (as she is here). Sean Hood (currently writing the Conan reboot)'s script is overflowing with black, black comedy and features the kind of fountains-of-gore climax that you can't help but laugh at while being repulsed by; it's easily his best work to date. Sick Girl is some kind of perfect storm of creativity all coming together at once. This has been the case with a number of Masters of Horror episodes (when was the last time Joe Dante directed something as good as Homecoming, or Billy Zane act as well as he did in Imprint, for example?), but Sick Girl stands out even in a high-class crowd. As much as I loved Argento's Jenifer, this one's even better. ****",4,"Lucky McKee rocks, as always.",1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,3903,"['Masters', 'Horror', 'Sick', 'Girl', 'Lucky', 'McKee', '2006', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'series', 'while', 'one', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'able', 'track', 'down', 'now', 'one', 'always', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'favorite', 'Sick', 'Girl', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'one', 'artists', 'who', 'far', 'too', 'few', 'pictures', 'fact', 'consider', 'Sick', 'Girl', 'short', 'exactly', 'sixty', 'minutes', 'McKee', 'directed', 'only', 'three', 'features', 'co-directed', 'fourth', 'scene', '2001', 'everything', 'gem', 'can', 'be', 'frustrating', 'Put', 'McKee', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'together', 'time', 'least', 'so', 'far', 'result', 'been', 'magic', 'Really', 'was', 'way', 'go', 'wrong', 'Then', 'popped', 'once', ""'d"", 'finally', 'gotten', 'hands', 'copy', 'see', 'name', 'Erin', 'Brown', 'go', 'start', 'thinking', 'why', 'name', 'sound', 'so', 'familiar', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'come', 'Then', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'see', 'one', 'most', 'downright', 'beautiful', 'women', 'film', 'someone', 'had', 'wheeled', 'huge', 'cake', 'strippers', 'had', 'jumped', 'right', 'living', 'room', 'LUCKY', 'MCKEE', 'IS', 'DIRECTING', 'MISTY', 'MUNDAE', 'Erin', 'Brown', 'Mundae', 'real', 'name', 'Misty', 'Mundae', 'most', 'beautiful', 'softcore', 'star', 'planet', 'Honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'imagine', 'better', 'definition', 'right', 'world', 'that.Plot', 'Ida', 'Bettis', 'who', 'teamed', 'up', 'McKee', 'May', 'attractive', 'socially', 'awkward', 'entomologist', 'just', 'had', 'most', 'recent', 'girlfriend', 'up', 'was', 'really', 'creeped', 'out', 'Ivy', 'menagerie', 'pet', 'insects', 'Ida', 'landlord', 'Miss', 'Beasley', 'Marcia', 'Bennett', 'who', 'appeared', 'McKee', 'features', 'came', 'out', ""n't"", 'happy', 'granddaughter', 'Betty', 'Presumed', 'Dead', 'Chandra', 'Cain', 'cute', 'button', 'Ida', 'bug', 'collection', 'bees', 'knees', 'pun', 'intended', 'Betty', 'thing', 'dressing', 'ladybug', 'rare', ""'ll"", 'see', 'dressed', 'anything', 'ladybug', 'costume', 'entire', 'movie', 'case', 'Ida', 'girlfriend-less', 'jock-macho-chick-obsessed', 'co-worker', 'Max', 'Jesse', 'Hlubik', 'McKee', 'veteran', 'who', 'most', 'recently', 'teamed', 'up', 'director', 'Red', 'advice', ""n't"", 'helping', 'much', 'Max', 'however', 'get', 'work', 'up', 'courage', 'approach', 'odd', 'seemingly', 'shy', 'artist', 'who', 'days', 'lobby', 'building', 'sketching', 'things', 'said', 'artist', 'just', 'as', 'nervous', 'socially', 'awkward', 'Ida', 'eventually', 'Misty', 'Brown', 'tossing', 'off', 'self-deprecating', ""'m"", 'not', 'hippie', 'afterwards', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'dinner', 'date', 'Magic', 'However', 'just', 'magic', 'happens', 'Ida', 'sent', 'mysterious', 'package', 'Brazil', 'containing', 'kind', 'bug', 'never', 'seen', 'take', 'work', 'have', 'Max', 'take', 'look', 'see', 'two', 'can', 'puzzle', 'out', 'what', 'loose', 'being', 'horror', 'flick', 'course', 'ordinary', 'bug', 'suspected', 'impossible', 'go', 'wrong', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'even', 'more', 'impossible', 'go', 'wrong', 'juxtaposition', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'Misty', 'Mundae', 'who', 'being', 'known', 'appearing', 'bad', 'softcore', 'movies', 'have', 'pretty', 'solid', 'acting', 'chops', 'when', 'pushed', 'do', 'something', 'here', 'Sean', 'Hood', 'currently', 'writing', 'Conan', 'reboot', 'script', 'overflowing', 'black', 'black', 'comedy', 'kind', 'fountains-of-gore', 'climax', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'being', 'repulsed', 'easily', 'best', 'work', 'date', 'Sick', 'Girl', 'kind', 'perfect', 'storm', 'creativity', 'coming', 'together', 'once', 'been', 'case', 'number', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'episodes', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'directed', 'something', 'as', 'good', 'Homecoming', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'act', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'Imprint', 'example', 'Sick', 'Girl', 'out', 'even', 'high-class', 'crowd', 'As', 'much', 'loved', 'Argento', 'Jenifer', 'one', 'even', 'better', '****']",Sick Girl masters Of Horror

982186,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B000F3UACU,titania86,"[1, 1]","* Spoilers *Ida Teeter is an entomologist who loves her job, but finds it hard to find a girlfriend that accepts it. Being shy and kind of awkward doesn't help either. All of this changes when her co-worker points out a beautiful girl who sketches in their office lobby every day. Ida is dubious, but eventually learns that her name is Misty Falls and awkwardly asks her out a couple days later. Their relationship steadily progresses and they move in together. Before they met, a large, strange bug was sent to Ida by an anonymous source. It escapes, nests in her pillow, and bites her girlfriend. Misty starts to act strangely, but she dismisses it as sickness. Bad idea.Lucky McKee's Sick Girl was featured as an episode in the Masters of Horror TV series. Despite its short runtime, it proved to be an excellent film. Angela Bettis and Erin Brown were perfect as Ida and Misty. Their chemistry was slightly awkward, but sweet and romantic all the same. I found Ida's old fashioned style and deliberate way of speaking, as well as Misty's frenetic energy, endearing. These characters were unique and surprisingly well fleshed out for the short time allotted to setting up their relationship and their personalities. Their relationship and their sexuality were never used solely to titillate the male audience (as is true with many horror films), but as a normal, heart-warming love story with a deeper meaning than just putting nudity on the screen.I believe this film is about the demonization of the homosexual lifestyle by the majority of our society.  Each person in the film that interact with Ida and Misty are representative of an aspect of society and their typical opinions about homosexuality. Ida's landlady Lana Beasley and Misty's father Malcolm Wolf (who is also Ida's teacher) represent the political far right, who are typically older people. They disapprove of Misty and Ida's lifestyle and go so far as to do the harm (by depriving them of a place to live and sending them a giant homicidal bug). Lana even accuses Ida of being a pedophile, a typical and false argument of someone opposing homosexuality. Betty Beasley, Lana's granddaughter, represents the younger people in society who typically are more progressive and generally support homosexuality. Betty looks up to Ida and sees her as a good friend. She also views Ida's relationship with Misty as nice and normal. Ida's coworker Max Grubb represents the typical heterosexual male. If her lesbian relationship isn't titillating him in some way, he doesn't really care about it. He disapproves of Misty and Ida's long term relationship and asks crude questions about it. Of course, these characters don't encompass the entirety of the people they represent, but the general majority.The film ends with both Misty and Ida largely pregnant with thousands of monstrous insect babies and being controlled by the large original insect that infected Misty. This ending puts into reality the fear that people against homosexuality have: that gay people will somehow destroy society if their relationships and lifestyle become normal. This is a ridiculous notion and shown to be so by this short film. I think Sick Girl portrays American opinions towards homosexuality in a concise and symbolic way while portraying realistic and nuanced characters. I highly recommend this film and also Lucky McKee's other films May and The Woman.",5,Great commentary on gay rights,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,3402,"['*', 'Spoilers', '*Ida', 'Teeter', 'entomologist', 'who', 'job', 'hard', 'find', 'girlfriend', 'Being', 'shy', 'kind', 'awkward', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'changes', 'when', 'co-worker', 'points', 'out', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'who', 'office', 'lobby', 'day', 'Ida', 'dubious', 'eventually', 'name', 'Misty', 'Falls', 'awkwardly', 'out', 'couple', 'days', 'later', 'relationship', 'steadily', 'move', 'together', 'met', 'large', 'strange', 'bug', 'was', 'sent', 'Ida', 'anonymous', 'source', 'nests', 'pillow', 'girlfriend', 'Misty', 'act', 'strangely', 'sickness', 'Bad', 'idea.Lucky', 'McKee', 'Sick', 'Girl', 'was', 'featured', 'episode', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'TV', 'series', 'short', 'runtime', 'proved', 'be', 'excellent', 'film', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'Erin', 'Brown', 'were', 'perfect', 'Ida', 'Misty', 'chemistry', 'was', 'slightly', 'awkward', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'same', 'found', 'Ida', 'old', 'fashioned', 'style', 'deliberate', 'way', 'speaking', 'as', 'well', 'Misty', 'frenetic', 'energy', 'endearing', 'characters', 'were', 'unique', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'short', 'time', 'allotted', 'setting', 'up', 'relationship', 'personalities', 'relationship', 'sexuality', 'were', 'never', 'used', 'solely', 'titillate', 'male', 'audience', 'true', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'normal', 'heart-warming', 'love', 'story', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'just', 'putting', 'nudity', 'screen.I', 'believe', 'film', 'demonization', 'homosexual', 'lifestyle', 'majority', 'society', 'person', 'film', 'interact', 'Ida', 'Misty', 'are', 'representative', 'aspect', 'society', 'typical', 'opinions', 'homosexuality', 'Ida', 'landlady', 'Lana', 'Beasley', 'Misty', 'father', 'Malcolm', 'Wolf', 'who', 'also', 'Ida', 'teacher', 'represent', 'political', 'far', 'right', 'who', 'are', 'typically', 'older', 'people', 'disapprove', 'Misty', 'Ida', 'lifestyle', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'do', 'harm', 'depriving', 'place', 'live', 'sending', 'giant', 'homicidal', 'bug', 'Lana', 'even', 'Ida', 'being', 'pedophile', 'typical', 'false', 'argument', 'someone', 'opposing', 'homosexuality', 'Betty', 'Beasley', 'Lana', 'granddaughter', 'younger', 'people', 'society', 'who', 'typically', 'are', 'more', 'progressive', 'generally', 'support', 'homosexuality', 'Betty', 'up', 'Ida', 'good', 'friend', 'also', 'Ida', 'relationship', 'Misty', 'nice', 'normal', 'Ida', 'coworker', 'Max', 'Grubb', 'typical', 'heterosexual', 'male', 'lesbian', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'titillating', 'way', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Misty', 'Ida', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'crude', 'questions', 'course', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'encompass', 'entirety', 'people', 'represent', 'general', 'majority.The', 'film', 'Misty', 'Ida', 'largely', 'pregnant', 'thousands', 'monstrous', 'insect', 'babies', 'being', 'controlled', 'large', 'original', 'insect', 'infected', 'Misty', 'ending', 'reality', 'fear', 'people', 'homosexuality', 'have', 'gay', 'people', 'will', 'somehow', 'destroy', 'society', 'relationships', 'lifestyle', 'become', 'normal', 'ridiculous', 'notion', 'shown', 'be', 'so', 'short', 'film', 'think', 'Sick', 'Girl', 'American', 'opinions', 'towards', 'homosexuality', 'concise', 'symbolic', 'way', 'portraying', 'realistic', 'nuanced', 'characters', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'also', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'other', 'films', 'May', 'Woman']",Sick Girl masters Of Horror
