It's unfortunate too because it could have been much better, if it had managed to tell its story a better. The story is about a couple who go to visit the boyfriends father in Spain. While out one night, the girlfriend, Georgie, is abducted and is held hostage on a boat where women are used as sex slaves. The boyfriend, David, then goes on a mission to find her.This is plotline that might have actually worked, however, the movie doesn't do a good job on making us feel bad for Georgie because it doesn't reveal the sex slavery angle enough. While the movie is titled Slave, it really only shows that world a couple times in the film. The rest is just the boyfriends mission to find her. I don't mind the boyfriends mission at all but we don't know enough on what goes on the boat. I know it sounds cruel, but the more you expose the sex slavery angle, the more sympathy we feel towards the character of Georgie and the more you want to see her saved. By not really revealing it, we really don't know her sufferings or what has happened to her. We know she's kidnapped and they do show one scene of her being raped and drugged but it's not enough for a film that's supposed to be solely based on that plot, there has to be more build. By not doing so, the movie comes off as really half-baked and doesn't feel like a complete film.The movie also does a poor job leading to the ending. The ending is completely rushed and poorly edited. It's so bad that I wish anyone luck in following it (if you actually managed to make it up to the ending).The acting is okay, especially from Natassia Malthe as Georgie, she is one of the most beautiful and underrated actresses from this generation. She's an actress who should have had a great career but never could quite get the big parts. Sam Page as David is okay too, a bit over the top on occasions.Overall, it's one of many straight to DVD films that didn't have the budget to really come through on the plot that they had. Again, the film had a great premise, it just needed to tell it right but it failed to do so unfortunately.",1,An Interesting Plotline That's Horribly Told,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,2161,"['Slave', 'one', 'straight', 'DVD', 'films', 'straight', 'DVD', 'film', 'unfortunate', 'too', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'managed', 'tell', 'story', 'better', 'story', 'couple', 'who', 'go', 'visit', 'boyfriends', 'father', 'Spain', 'out', 'one', 'night', 'girlfriend', 'Georgie', 'abducted', 'held', 'hostage', 'boat', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'used', 'sex', 'slaves', 'boyfriend', 'David', 'then', 'mission', 'find', 'her.This', 'plotline', 'might', 'have', 'actually', 'worked', 'however', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'feel', 'bad', 'Georgie', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'sex', 'slavery', 'angle', 'enough', 'movie', 'titled', 'Slave', 'really', 'only', 'world', 'couple', 'times', 'film', 'rest', 'just', 'boyfriends', 'mission', 'find', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'boyfriends', 'mission', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'what', 'boat', 'know', 'cruel', 'more', 'expose', 'sex', 'slavery', 'angle', 'more', 'sympathy', 'feel', 'character', 'Georgie', 'more', 'want', 'see', 'saved', 'not', 'really', 'revealing', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sufferings', 'what', 'happened', 'know', 'kidnapped', 'do', 'show', 'one', 'scene', 'being', 'raped', 'drugged', 'not', 'enough', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'solely', 'based', 'plot', 'be', 'more', 'build', 'not', 'doing', 'so', 'movie', 'off', 'really', 'half-baked', ""n't"", 'feel', 'complete', 'film.The', 'movie', 'also', 'poor', 'job', 'leading', 'ending', 'ending', 'completely', 'rushed', 'poorly', 'edited', 'so', 'bad', 'wish', 'anyone', 'luck', 'following', 'actually', 'managed', 'make', 'up', 'ending', '.The', 'acting', 'okay', 'especially', 'Natassia', 'Malthe', 'Georgie', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'underrated', 'actresses', 'generation', 'actress', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'career', 'never', 'could', 'quite', 'get', 'big', 'parts', 'Sam', 'Page', 'David', 'okay', 'too', 'bit', 'top', 'occasions.Overall', 'one', 'many', 'straight', 'DVD', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'budget', 'really', 'come', 'plot', 'had', 'Again', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'premise', 'just', 'needed', 'tell', 'right', 'failed', 'do', 'so', 'unfortunately']",Slave

1384356,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0043K8LXQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Slave (Darryn Welch, 2009)What's really interesting about this movie--and I am not using that word in any sort of ironic sense--is the bait-and-switch Darryn Welch and his marketing folks used here. It's one of those rare cases where I went into a movie expecting one thing and got another, but then found ""another"" to be more interesting than ""one thing."" That's happened maybe half a dozen times in my movie-watching career, and it makes me wish even more that this had been a better movie than it is; it had a great deal of potential, most of which went unrealized. But I have to give Darryn Welch a lot of points for trying to do something entirely different from the usual exploitation/torture-porn-wannabe thriller that is all too common these days.Plot: a father, Robert Dunsmore (Wish You Were Here's Michael Maxwell), and son, David (Cruel World's Sam Page), have grown up on opposite sides of the Atlantic and in opposite ways. Robert is involved in organized crime; David is an aspiring lawyer. David is also about to get married to the lovely Georgie (Lake Placid's Natassia Malthe), who has placed one single stricture on David before they tie the knot: he's got to take her over to Spain to meet dear old Dad. (He must be over there spending a year dead for tax reasons.) Away they go, but when they get to the ancestral pile, dad's not around, so they decide to head out to a club. They meet, and hang out with, Alejandro (Serie B's Roger Pera), a slimy drug dealer who claims to be a great friend of Robert's, getting royally pissed along the way (in the British sense of the word). David stumbles off to the restroom to do the kinds of things you do there, leaving Georgie in Alejandro's seemingly-capable hands...but when he gets back, she has disappeared, and Alejandro claims to have never met her. The next morning, both Robert and the police seem entirely uninterested in helping David find her, so it's left to him to track down Alejandro, find out what's really going on, and recover his lady.Welch is definitely going for something different here; this is far more talk-piece than it is action thriller, working in the mind-game realm more than anything during its first half. Then comes the second, and the movie starts on its way down the hill. For one thing, I can't tell if some of the movie's characterizations of its bad guys are incompetently racist, or just racist in general. (I ended up not wanting to think about it too hard.) For another, the movie moves from the interesting and cerebral into the generic-action-thriller, which was quite the letdown. And then... the climax. Oh, man, the climax. I understand what Welch was trying to do there, and while the symbolism was a little heavy-handed, it did make sense. But the contortions he had to go through in order to get there are ridiculous (any time your movie forces you to insert a flashback-from-another-character's-perspective scene to explain a character's actions, either your script has failed or you're not giving your audience enough credit for understanding said character's motivation). Still, I found it worth watching for the portion of its first half after Georgie disappears. **",2,Much potential not well realized.,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,3183,"['Slave', 'Darryn', 'Welch', '2009', 'What', 'really', 'interesting', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'using', 'word', 'sort', 'ironic', 'sense', 'bait-and-switch', 'Darryn', 'Welch', 'marketing', 'folks', 'used', 'here', 'one', 'rare', 'cases', 'where', 'went', 'movie', 'expecting', 'one', 'thing', 'got', 'then', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'one', 'thing', 'happened', 'maybe', 'dozen', 'times', 'movie-watching', 'career', 'wish', 'even', 'more', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'potential', 'most', 'went', 'unrealized', 'have', 'give', 'Darryn', 'Welch', 'lot', 'points', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'entirely', 'different', 'usual', 'exploitation/torture-porn-wannabe', 'thriller', 'too', 'common', 'days.Plot', 'father', 'Robert', 'Dunsmore', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'Michael', 'Maxwell', 'son', 'David', 'Cruel', 'World', 'Sam', 'Page', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'opposite', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'opposite', 'ways', 'Robert', 'involved', 'organized', 'crime', 'David', 'aspiring', 'lawyer', 'David', 'also', 'about', 'get', 'married', 'lovely', 'Georgie', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'Natassia', 'Malthe', 'who', 'placed', 'one', 'single', 'stricture', 'David', 'tie', 'knot', 'got', 'take', 'Spain', 'meet', 'dear', 'old', 'Dad', 'must', 'be', 'there', 'spending', 'year', 'dead', 'tax', 'reasons', 'Away', 'go', 'when', 'get', 'ancestral', 'pile', 'dad', 'not', 'around', 'decide', 'head', 'out', 'club', 'meet', 'hang', 'out', 'Alejandro', 'Serie', 'B', 'Roger', 'Pera', 'slimy', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'be', 'great', 'friend', 'Robert', 'getting', 'royally', 'pissed', 'way', 'British', 'sense', 'word', 'David', 'restroom', 'do', 'kinds', 'things', 'do', 'there', 'leaving', 'Georgie', 'Alejandro', 'seemingly-capable', 'hands', 'when', 'back', 'disappeared', 'Alejandro', 'claims', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'next', 'morning', 'Robert', 'police', 'seem', 'entirely', 'uninterested', 'helping', 'David', 'find', 'left', 'track', 'down', 'Alejandro', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'recover', 'lady.Welch', 'definitely', 'going', 'something', 'different', 'here', 'far', 'more', 'talk-piece', 'action', 'thriller', 'working', 'mind-game', 'realm', 'more', 'anything', 'first', 'half', 'Then', 'second', 'movie', 'way', 'hill', 'one', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'movie', 'characterizations', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'incompetently', 'racist', 'just', 'racist', 'general', 'ended', 'up', 'not', 'wanting', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'movie', 'interesting', 'cerebral', 'generic-action-thriller', 'was', 'quite', 'letdown', 'then', 'climax', 'Oh', 'man', 'climax', 'understand', 'what', 'Welch', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'there', 'symbolism', 'was', 'little', 'heavy-handed', 'did', 'make', 'sense', 'contortions', 'had', 'go', 'order', 'get', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'time', 'movie', 'forces', 'insert', ""flashback-from-another-character's-perspective"", 'scene', 'explain', 'character', 'actions', 'either', 'script', 'failed', ""'re"", 'not', 'giving', 'audience', 'enough', 'credit', 'understanding', 'said', 'character', 'motivation', 'Still', 'found', 'worth', 'watching', 'portion', 'first', 'half', 'Georgie', 'disappears', '**']",Slave
