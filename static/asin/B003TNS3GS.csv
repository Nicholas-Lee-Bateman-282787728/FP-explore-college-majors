It had potential - as most ghost stories do - but it wasn't scary at all and the storyline was only so-so.*SPOILER* The gas leak explanation for everyone's halucinations undermined the whole premise of a ghost story and left the viewer confused.  The bracelet and pendant got us back on track but by then it was too late. I already felt cheated because the movie was pretty much over.  I guess that was intended to leave us questioning whether it really was all about the gas leak.  For me, it seemed like a clumsy way of tying up an already weak storyline.It's a good movie for small budget, I guess, as long as your expectations are realistic. If I were the person who wrote this story, I'd be thrilled to see it on screen.

1362279,A2364DJDJWF5LO,B003TNS3GS,Chase Leon,"[13, 27]","Even though I'm an Indie movie fan in general, I have always detested when casts and crew members involved in an Indie film go to various sites and falsely pose as casual ""fans"" of the film, and then praises the film to the high heavens. (usually to the point of absurdity)Your average, true film fan can detect these phony reviews instantly (it doesn't take a rocket scientist) and it actually does more harm than good for the film. We viewers figure if someone has to practice deception to get you to watch the film, then it must be a weak film. Trust me, when an Indie film is great, word-of-mouth (the honest kind) will eventually bring success for the film. Sometimes it takes awhile, but, it will happen. (Consider Sling Blade for example)We understand that all involved in the film want it to be a success, but, trying to dupe someone into believing your film is uber-great is an extremely tacky thing to do, and is very off-putting to movie fans.I have discovered this deceptive praise for Ghosts Don't Exist on two different sites thus far. With just a tiny bit of investigating, I have proved my suspicions to be correct. Because of this, I almost completely lost interest in actually seeing the film.So, those who are guilty of doing this, I promise you, you would get better reactions and results if you would just be honest. Don't lie and pretend you are a casual ""fan"" of the film. Be honest and state how you were involved in the making of the film, and how you really believe in its merits.Honesty IS the best policy.BTW, I would give this film 2 and a half stars if I could, but Amazon only allows full stars.",2,Beware,1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,1626,"['Even', ""'m"", 'Indie', 'movie', 'fan', 'general', 'have', 'always', 'detested', 'when', 'casts', 'crew', 'members', 'involved', 'Indie', 'film', 'go', 'various', 'sites', 'falsely', 'pose', 'casual', 'fans', 'film', 'then', 'film', 'high', 'heavens', 'usually', 'point', 'absurdity', 'average', 'true', 'film', 'fan', 'can', 'detect', 'phony', 'reviews', 'instantly', ""n't"", 'take', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'actually', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'film', 'viewers', 'figure', 'someone', 'practice', 'deception', 'get', 'watch', 'film', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'weak', 'film', 'Trust', 'when', 'Indie', 'film', 'great', 'word-of-mouth', 'honest', 'kind', 'will', 'eventually', 'bring', 'success', 'film', 'awhile', 'will', 'happen', 'Consider', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'example', 'understand', 'involved', 'film', 'want', 'be', 'success', 'trying', 'dupe', 'someone', 'believing', 'film', 'uber-great', 'extremely', 'tacky', 'thing', 'do', 'very', 'off-putting', 'movie', 'fans.I', 'have', 'discovered', 'deceptive', 'praise', 'Ghosts', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Exist', 'two', 'different', 'sites', 'thus', 'far', 'just', 'tiny', 'bit', 'investigating', 'have', 'proved', 'suspicions', 'be', 'correct', 'almost', 'completely', 'lost', 'interest', 'actually', 'seeing', 'film.So', 'who', 'are', 'guilty', 'doing', 'promise', 'would', 'get', 'better', 'reactions', 'results', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'honest', 'Do', ""n't"", 'lie', 'pretend', 'are', 'casual', 'fan', 'film', 'Be', 'honest', 'state', 'how', 'were', 'involved', 'making', 'film', 'how', 'really', 'believe', 'merits.Honesty', 'best', 'policy.BTW', 'would', 'give', 'film', '2', 'half', 'stars', 'could', 'Amazon', 'only', 'full', 'stars']",N/A

There is scene after scene of the actors standing in one position, woodenly delivering their lines without any movement of the cameras for several minutes at a time. Or, there are several scenes with the actors just standing around,NOT saying anything at all! Even an A/V student in high school knows to move the camera for different views. And one of the biggest problems of the script is that ghosts do not  exist! Period. This will be a bit of a spoiler but there aren't any ghosts or scares in this film. I don't mean I've seen so many, nothing scares me anymore, I mean there just aren't any frightening moments or spirits! There isn't anything supernatural in this story.

It started out slow with poor acting and no explanation of who the characters were.  And it was never clarified throughout this mess.  Unless it was done during one of the times I fell asleep.  When I thought the movie was going to get better, it fizzled out and returned to slow, boring, and stupid.  The ending explained why the characters where seeing 'ghosts' and it was believable.  The ending just fell apart.  I was hoping for more because I actually bought this garbage.These idiots had the opportunity to take this movie in so many directions.  Even with a low budget.  This is not a scary movie!  So what if some of the characters died... it should have happened within the first 5 minutes.  I bought this DVD based on the inflated reviews... It seems the rave reviews were given by employees of the film... now I know what an ""Indie"" is.  I should have read ALL the reviews.  Save your money.  This movie is not even worthy as a rental.
