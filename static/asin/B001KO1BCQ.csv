She's sentenced to hang but manages to escape with the aid of Jack Cooper (Sheffer). Marshal Speakes will do almost anything to bring her to justice and avenge his son's death.ROUGH RIDERS--  Made-for-TV biopic about Teddy Roosevelt (Berenger) and the volunteer cavalrymen who in the Spanish-American War of 1898 charged up the heavily-defended San Juan Hill alongside him. Top-notch cast includes co-star Elliott as Capt. Bucky O'Neil.YOU KNOW MY NAME--  TV movie about real life cowboy and pioneering film director Bill Tilghman (Elliott). An ex-buffalo hunter and deputy of Wyatt Earp, Tilghman is intent on producing realistic westerns, but faces opposition when he favors unknowns for his pictures rather than established stars like Tom Mix. Tilghman also has to deal with a former lawman rival named Wiley (Howard), who makes constant trouble for him.Also recommended:In the 4-hour epicGETTYSBURG(1993), Elliott portrays Gen. John Buford. On July 1st, 1863, the heroic efforts of Buford's two brigades of dismounted cavalrymen slowed Gen. Rob't E. Lee's advance on the town of Gettysburg, and made possible the victory that came two days later.Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to 10 viewer poll ratings found at a film resource website.(6.0) The Desperate Trail (1995) - Sam Elliott/Craig Sheffer/Linda Fiorentino/Frank Whaley/John Furlong/Robin Westphal(7.2) Rough Riders (TV-1997) - Tom Berenger/Sam Elliott/Gary Busey/Brad Johnson/Illeana Douglas/Chris Noth/Brian Keith/George Hamilton/R.

Rough riders (a two part mini series) is a great movie how ever I wouldn't expect to see it in a Sam Elliot collection as his screen time is minimal compared to the &#34;star&#34; who is Tom Berenger. &#34;You know my name&#34; is, in my opinion the weakest of the three with &#34;The desperate trail&#34; being the outstanding feature.  You can't help feeling that once you've seen Elliot in a western role you've seen them all. His characterization tend to be very similar whether you're watching Roadhouse or Tombstone, that said I'm still a fan of his work.This is a very good set and still better than most. &#34;Desperate trail&#34; is worth the purchase alone so value for money is not an issue.I've given it three stars because Elliot, in my mind is only loosley the feature. It have more accurately  been titled Western collection with Sam elliot (a subtle but nonetheless better discription). If you want a comparison the Tom Selleck collection is a better set.
