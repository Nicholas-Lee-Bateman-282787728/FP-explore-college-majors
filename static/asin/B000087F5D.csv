Also, on this dvd Frankie gets personal and in touch with the audience.Frankie delivers another great show as usual. All, I have to say is that I recommend this dvd to any MAZE fan. I love this whole dvd. I enjoy every song on this dvd.  He sings some of his best songs. I was glad to see him perform ""We Are One"". Frankie's band is always full of energy they can really put on a good show. You can't lose with this dvd. I love his performance of Running Away and We Are One. Frankie is just indescribeable he is increduously talented and there are no words to describe him.",5,NO WORDS CAN DESCRIBE!!!!,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,619,"['Frankie', 'did', 'again', 'time', 'was', 'LA', 'Also', 'dvd', 'Frankie', 'personal', 'touch', 'audience.Frankie', 'great', 'show', 'usual', 'have', 'say', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'MAZE', 'fan', 'love', 'whole', 'dvd', 'enjoy', 'song', 'dvd', 'best', 'songs', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'perform', 'Are', 'One', 'Frankie', 'band', 'always', 'full', 'energy', 'can', 'really', 'put', 'good', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lose', 'dvd', 'love', 'performance', 'Running', 'Away', 'Are', 'One', 'Frankie', 'just', 'indescribeable', 'increduously', 'talented', 'are', 'words', 'describe']",N/A
