It is in English with subtitles if needed.This black and white film is useful for allied health classes studying the history of infectious disease. You know how ""British English"" films are often difficult to understand because they speak so rapidly? That's not the case here. The plot, action, and language are easy to follow.

Created in the days when a film could tell a simple story, 1936, with a few dramatic embellishments, it has a balance of historical fact and drama.  By today's standards it might be considered a &#34;docudrama.&#34;  The film shows Pasteur as a simple but devoted family man, a dedicated scientist with a deep desire to help humanity root out diseases.  His almost childish curiosity will appeal to young, dare I say it, budding scientists.  There is honesty, clarity of purpose, and a few tear-jerking moments when a mother brings her sick child to Dr. Pasteur.  The film is suitable for viewing in classrooms although students must be warned that it is black and white, contains no special effects and is a simple but well-told story.
