995588,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B000FSMEDI,Chris Luallen,"[0, 1]","Three couples are caught up in various sexual escapades. The young school teacher who is having an affair with an older writer, a businessman, Alvaro, who is cheating on his pregnant wife and the old married couple of Macha and Emilio who are having trouble stirring up any passion in the bedroom, mostly due to Emilio's utter sexual incompetence.It plays out like a comic farce with no serious tone of moral condemnation. But to fully appreciate it I think you must try to understand it within the context of Chilean society, with all the infidelity and sexual obsession that takes place in a superficially puritanical society. Of course, characters like the womanizing Alvaro and clueless Emilio are exaggerated for comic effect. But my wife, who is originally from Ecuador, says that what happens in this movie is really not that far from what happens in reality among some couples in Latin America. So I can see why this film made such a big splash in Chile.",4,Exposes The Underlying Sexual Issues In Chilean Society,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,962,"['Three', 'couples', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'various', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'young', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'older', 'writer', 'businessman', 'Alvaro', 'who', 'cheating', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'old', 'married', 'couple', 'Macha', 'Emilio', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'stirring', 'up', 'passion', 'bedroom', 'mostly', 'due', 'Emilio', 'utter', 'sexual', 'incompetence.It', 'out', 'comic', 'farce', 'serious', 'tone', 'moral', 'condemnation', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'think', 'must', 'try', 'understand', 'context', 'Chilean', 'society', 'infidelity', 'sexual', 'obsession', 'place', 'superficially', 'puritanical', 'society', 'course', 'characters', 'womanizing', 'Alvaro', 'clueless', 'Emilio', 'are', 'exaggerated', 'comic', 'effect', 'wife', 'who', 'originally', 'Ecuador', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'far', 'what', 'reality', 'couples', 'Latin', 'America', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'made', 'big', 'splash', 'Chile']",N/A
995589,AGRP8AW530HAQ,B000FSMEDI,"Julio Lopez ""soundtrack fan""","[5, 8]","A big hype in Chile a couple of years ago, ""Sexo con Amor"" is well acted and has some funny moments, although it looks rather old-fashioned and a little vulgar. It's similar to those famous italian sexual comedies from the 70's, with Gloria Guida, Edwige Fenech or Laura Antonelli. They used to be very popular and producers made good profits out of them. Yet, artistically speaking, doubts arise...Essentially, it was conceived as a commercial massive product, and that's exactly what you get. It will be specially enjoyed by the ones who like rancid jokes on sexuality and similarities.

995590,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000FSMEDI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","""Sexo Con Amor"" isn't really what I had expected. It's been a long time since I've seen a picture so sex obsessed. Every character in the movie is ruled by his/her urges. Men, in particular, are completely unable to control themselves--and fidelity, love and commitment fall by the wayside whenever a hot woman is present. It's a pretty limited worldview, but that would be OK if anything was going on intellectually in this film. Content to be a slapstick farce, however, I gave up trying to divine any kind of understanding or logic in these characters.That said, there are moments in ""Sexo Con Amor"" that are amusing. It's not a laugh out loud type of humor (to me, anyway)--more of a roll my eyes in disbelief type. It's fast paced, the actors engaging and really throwing themselves into their roles. So I appreciated that--but I can't help it, I kept feeling like I was watching some crazy sexed-up foreign version of ""Three's Company."" That is the level of sophistication.I didn't particularly dislike this film, but in a few months I'm sure I won't remember a second of it. It could have been something special, especially with this cast--but it's content to be an empty headed amusement. While I'd rate this 2 1/2 stars, I am going to round up in this case for an absolute lack of pretension. Check this out with very limited expectations--and if you have serious issues with casual adultery, avoid this movie at all costs.

995592,AUTBHG6070SL4,B000FSMEDI,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[2, 3]","One of these dysfunctional couples includes a husband whose philandering borders on obsession, but driven to rage by the idea that his wife even thinks that kind of thought herself. She doesn't, of course, but that's no excuse. Another couple consists of a man and his son's pretty teacher - never mind that each is already coupled somewhere else. The third pairs long-suffering Maca with a husband that no woman deserves, at least in bed. His idea of foreplay seems to consist of tugging her undies out of the way. No wonder the poor woman doesn't get much out of it. Even her gyno exam, usually about as sexy as an oil change from what I'm told, gives her more and gentler attention than she ever gets at home.The males come in for some well-deserved bashing: the supposed adult with teenage libido and impulsiveness, the graying guy after the cute yonger woman, and the insensitive boor. All of this gives plenty to laugh at, with pleasant eroticism (well, mostly pleasant) throughout. And in the end, pretty much everyone gets what they deserve - especially Maca, the poster girl for the idea that there are no frigid women, just clumsy men.
