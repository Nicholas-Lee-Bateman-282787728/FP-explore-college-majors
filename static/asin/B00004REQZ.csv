Instead, it was interrupted by boring old farts talking about the technical details of the songs. I was expecting to see baby o Riley, but  all I kept getting was  some prima donna messing things up. Why didn't they keep the chit-chat  between the songs instead of during the songs. I liked the Join Together  song on the top-of-the pops at the end becuase it was not interrupted.

548157,AGHJ9BMVMGIOL,B00004REQZ,colinwoodward,"[5, 5]","I've heard all the of Who's major albums many times, have read the Dave Marsh history of the band as well as biographies of Moon and Townshend, have a live concert bootleg, find the post-Moon albums disappointing, have seen plenty of concert footage (of which there is never enough), and saw the boys perform Quodrophenia in 1996. That said, this DVD contains something for just about every level of Who fan. What I would have wanted is more footage from 1971-2, when the Who recorded the album and went on tour. There's no footage of the band in the studio making the album. Perhaps no such footage exists. But we do get some scenes of Pete working on the synthesizer parts. It's amazing to see how far technology has come. What took up a whole room of equipment in the early 70s can now fit on a Casio keyboard. The concert footage of ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" and ""Baba O'Riley,"" which is shown repeatedly, is from the late 70s film the Kids are Alright. Novice fans might not be able to tell. Entwhistle's concert performance of ""My Wife"" looks to be from 1972, perhaps the closest the DVD comes to showing the Who at their peak. Still, this making-of DVD contains many pleasures. I had never heard Pete's ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" demo, which demonstrates that he was a one-man band (as those who have heard ""Who Came First"" can attest). I've always wanted to see Pete playing piano, and here the DVD obliges by showing him perform some of ""Pure and Easy."" Also nice here is Pete's solo, acoustic rendition of ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" near the end of the disk. I also liked it when the album tracks were isolated to emphasize the voice, bass, drums, or guitar parts. It's almost touching to see Roger get giddy over Keith's drum playing on ""Behind Blue Eyes."" Anyone who is familiar with the Who will know a lot about the Lifehouse project, and one can read liner notes of the ""Who's Next"" reissues to learn even more. This DVD goes heavy on the blockbuster songs ""Baba O'Riley,"" ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" and ""Behind Blue Eyes."" ""Bargain"" and ""Getting in Tune"" are only played as background music clips, and ""Love Ain't for Keeping"" isn't mentioned at all. The commentary is good. Pete is the kind of guy incapable of giving a boring interview, and this DVD is no exception. It's particularly nice to see him talk without having to explain for the millionth time why the Who smashed their instruments--a question by the way, to which he has given various answers. The rivalry between Pete and Roger is also preserved when Pete jokingly refers to Roger as a ""furry animal."" In short, it's always great to see the Who, whether live or on tape. I would have liked this DVD to have been 2 hours or more, but it does give a good overview of perhaps the best rock album of the 1970s.",4,"Great album, good DVD",1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,2781,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'Who', 'major', 'albums', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'read', 'Dave', 'Marsh', 'history', 'band', 'as', 'well', 'biographies', 'Moon', 'Townshend', 'have', 'live', 'concert', 'bootleg', 'find', 'post-Moon', 'albums', 'disappointing', 'have', 'seen', 'plenty', 'concert', 'footage', 'never', 'enough', 'saw', 'boys', 'perform', 'Quodrophenia', '1996', 'said', 'DVD', 'something', 'just', 'level', 'Who', 'fan', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'more', 'footage', '1971-2', 'when', 'Who', 'recorded', 'album', 'went', 'tour', 'footage', 'band', 'studio', 'making', 'album', 'Perhaps', 'such', 'footage', 'exists', 'do', 'get', 'scenes', 'Pete', 'working', 'synthesizer', 'parts', 'amazing', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'technology', 'come', 'What', 'took', 'up', 'whole', 'room', 'equipment', 'early', '70s', 'can', 'now', 'fit', 'Casio', 'keyboard', 'concert', 'footage', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Fooled', 'Again', 'Baba', ""O'Riley"", 'shown', 'repeatedly', 'late', '70s', 'film', 'Kids', 'are', 'Alright', 'Novice', 'fans', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'Entwhistle', 'concert', 'performance', 'Wife', 'be', '1972', 'perhaps', 'closest', 'DVD', 'showing', 'Who', 'peak', 'Still', 'making-of', 'DVD', 'many', 'pleasures', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Pete', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Fooled', 'Again', 'demo', 'was', 'one-man', 'band', 'who', 'have', 'heard', 'Who', 'Came', 'First', 'can', 'attest', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'Pete', 'playing', 'piano', 'here', 'DVD', 'obliges', 'showing', 'perform', 'Pure', 'Easy', 'Also', 'nice', 'here', 'Pete', 'solo', 'acoustic', 'rendition', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Fooled', 'Again', 'end', 'disk', 'also', 'liked', 'when', 'album', 'tracks', 'were', 'isolated', 'emphasize', 'voice', 'bass', 'drums', 'guitar', 'parts', 'almost', 'touching', 'see', 'Roger', 'get', 'giddy', 'Keith', 'drum', 'playing', 'Blue', 'Eyes', 'Anyone', 'who', 'familiar', 'Who', 'will', 'know', 'lot', 'Lifehouse', 'project', 'one', 'can', 'read', 'liner', 'notes', 'Who', 'Next', 'learn', 'even', 'more', 'DVD', 'heavy', 'blockbuster', 'Baba', ""O'Riley"", 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Fooled', 'Again', 'Blue', 'Eyes', 'Bargain', 'Getting', 'Tune', 'are', 'only', 'played', 'background', 'music', 'clips', 'Love', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Keeping', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'commentary', 'good', 'Pete', 'kind', 'guy', 'incapable', 'giving', 'boring', 'interview', 'DVD', 'exception', 'particularly', 'nice', 'see', 'talk', 'having', 'explain', 'millionth', 'time', 'why', 'Who', 'smashed', 'instruments', 'question', 'way', 'given', 'various', 'answers', 'rivalry', 'Pete', 'Roger', 'also', 'preserved', 'when', 'Pete', 'jokingly', 'Roger', 'furry', 'animal', 'short', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'Who', 'live', 'tape', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', '2', 'hours', 'more', 'give', 'good', 'overview', 'perhaps', 'best', 'rock', 'album', '1970s']",N/A

First, these were fantastic musicians.  Second, Townshend is really a great musical talent.  Third, you realize that music just isn't at the same level any more.  Not because there are not great musicians around, but rather the art form itself has changed.  It is because this current generation has moved onto other musical forms.  The concept album doesn't speak to younger generations. Too bad, because The Who show what power great rock music can have.  It truly is a great art form.When I heard this album in college, I was blown away.  From Baba O'Riley - which is not about getting wasted, but rather is about wasted life - to Won't Get Fooled Again, the quality of the music is amazing.You will get to see acoustic performances of several songs, a discussion of the Lifehouse concept which led to Who's Next (you could call it Townshend's Smile), several engineers discussing the individual tracks and how the totality of the music was created, and interviews with Townshend, Entwistle and Daltrey.

I'll spare you all the ins and outs of Townshends's ill-fated Lifehouse project; suffice it to say, he was left with a cache of wonderfully timeless tunes: ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" and ""Bargain"" and ""Goin' Mobile"" and ""Behind Blue Eyes"" are only a few.  The entire album, which is rather cohesive despite the lack of a linear storyline, is taut, focused, and about as well produced as any album from the era (1972).This DVD sheds light on the recording process, the band's use of synthesizers, and even the wonderfully erratic personality of the band's late drummer, Keith Moon.  There are even full length acoustic performances of Townshend, which are a nice bonus.

Stupid of you, sorry to say but true.This is not a concert. You will just need to turn around the box and read what it's all about. Don't make the same mistake as the brainless hzli.Here, you will get an amazing journey with interviews and behind-the-recording-mixing-console, to know details and secrets about the recording of the album &quot;WHO'S NEXT&quot;, and the reasons why it happened the way it did. It's absolutely interesting to see.Includes some very rare footage of Pete Townshend at his home studio back in 1971 taping some demos for the Lifehouse project, and you will hear him explaining the way he got that incredible ORGAN background for &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;.Also you will have rare footage of The Who performing live some of the songs from this album in different moments of their career.Plain and simple.

548171,A3EZ2PLA8AFPIF,B00004REQZ,"""The Woj""","[11, 12]","This dvd provides many insights into the Who's classic album, ""Who's Next"", from it's genesis as Townshend's failed ""Lifehouse"" project to the finished product we know today.The dvd includes several  acoustic solo numbers performed by Townshend exclusively for this release (by far this dvd's strongpoint).  My only fault with this title is the length and hence it being incomplete.  It only runs an hour with no bonus material added.  Only  a handful of songs from the album are viewed in any depth, consequently the documentary seems incomplete.  It leaves the fan wanting & expecting more.  Obviously there is no commentary from Keith Moon presented here, but it would have been great to see more video footage showing Moon & his bandmates in the studio.  All in all a very good dvd for the devoted Who fan.  However, its not the best place to start for the novice.  I would recommend the 5 star 2 dvd set of ""The Kids Are Alright"" as your first Who dvd purchase.",4,Required Viewing For Any Who Fan...,1069804800,"11 26, 2003",2003,966,"['dvd', 'many', 'insights', 'Who', 'classic', 'album', 'Who', 'Next', 'genesis', 'Townshend', 'failed', 'Lifehouse', 'project', 'finished', 'product', 'know', 'today.The', 'dvd', 'several', 'acoustic', 'solo', 'numbers', 'performed', 'Townshend', 'exclusively', 'release', 'far', 'dvd', 'strongpoint', 'only', 'fault', 'title', 'length', 'hence', 'being', 'incomplete', 'only', 'hour', 'bonus', 'material', 'added', 'Only', 'handful', 'songs', 'album', 'are', 'viewed', 'depth', 'consequently', 'documentary', 'incomplete', 'fan', 'wanting', 'expecting', 'more', 'Obviously', 'commentary', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'presented', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'see', 'more', 'video', 'footage', 'showing', 'Moon', 'bandmates', 'studio', 'very', 'good', 'dvd', 'devoted', 'Who', 'fan', 'However', 'not', 'best', 'place', 'start', 'novice', 'would', 'recommend', '5', 'star', '2', 'dvd', 'set', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Alright', 'first', 'Who', 'dvd', 'purchase']",N/A
