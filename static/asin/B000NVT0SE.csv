And how it carries over into later life.""Rising"" tells the early story of today's most popular villian, when he was a young boy in Lithuania, with caring parents, a nice home, and a close relationship with his baby sister. The film makers stress on this relationship, taking care to portray him as the doting brother over this very sweet, likable little girl, and when Nazi occupiers storm the region, it is very tough segment to watch. The family takes refuge in a home in a wooded area, with some friends, and a Russian tank pulls up to the house, but the soldiers only want some water. German fighter planes appear overhead, along with German tanks on the ground, accompanied with gunfire and bombs, and these two horrified little kids see their parents die in a hail of bullets and shrapnel. The homes in the area are looted, and those in the Nazi's way are exterminated (""...Are you a Jew? Are you a Gypsy?...""). It's a harsh Winter, and these men are starving, and since little Mischa has Pneumonia, she is put on the menu.Cut to eight years later...Hannibal is then sent to live in an academy, which is located in the building which was once his home. You can see his bitterness. He won't join in the mindless behavior expected of the cadets, and is punished for hurting bullies. He escapes the academy, and manages to locate his aunt, a Japanese woman his late uncle married after she lost it all in Hiroshima, and she provides him with some desperately needed structure in his life. She teaches him self-discipline, and Japanese swordsmanship, which comes in handy when a truly repulsive man insults her honor in a public market. He slaughters this slob like a hog, and he becomes young Hannibal's first victim, his head removed with one slice to the neck.The story takes on a ""Death Wish"" tone, as Hannibal becomes a vigilante, locating the men who looted his home and killed and devoured his beloved little sister, a man on a mission. But perverse twists of events in the story lead to what would become his transformation, from crusader, to the icy-eyed sociopath he would later become, and he really has a heavy load he has to carry for the rest of his life.I found myself rooting for him wholeheartedly all the way through, and toward the end, when he gets his ultimate shock, I really felt bad for him.Thomas Harris is a compelling writer, and where I have to admit I haven't read the book this is based on, I have read the others in the series, and even though many points in the novels were changed or deleted, it still makes for some truly gripping viewing.",5,"""...rudeness is epidemic...""",1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,2668,"['How', 'began', 'What', 'can', 'happen', 'nice', 'boy', 'enough', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'rapid', 'succession', 'how', 'over', 'later', 'life', 'Rising', 'early', 'story', 'today', 'most', 'popular', 'villian', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'Lithuania', 'caring', 'parents', 'nice', 'home', 'close', 'relationship', 'baby', 'sister', 'film', 'makers', 'stress', 'relationship', 'taking', 'care', 'portray', 'doting', 'brother', 'very', 'sweet', 'likable', 'little', 'girl', 'when', 'Nazi', 'storm', 'region', 'very', 'tough', 'segment', 'watch', 'family', 'refuge', 'home', 'wooded', 'area', 'friends', 'Russian', 'tank', 'up', 'house', 'soldiers', 'only', 'want', 'water', 'German', 'fighter', 'planes', 'appear', 'overhead', 'German', 'tanks', 'ground', 'accompanied', 'gunfire', 'bombs', 'two', 'horrified', 'little', 'kids', 'see', 'parents', 'die', 'hail', 'bullets', 'shrapnel', 'homes', 'area', 'are', 'looted', 'Nazi', 'way', 'are', 'exterminated', 'Are', 'Jew', 'Are', 'Gypsy', 'harsh', 'Winter', 'men', 'are', 'starving', 'little', 'Mischa', 'Pneumonia', 'put', 'menu.Cut', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'Hannibal', 'then', 'sent', 'live', 'academy', 'located', 'building', 'was', 'once', 'home', 'can', 'see', 'bitterness', 'wo', ""n't"", 'join', 'mindless', 'behavior', 'expected', 'cadets', 'punished', 'hurting', 'bullies', 'academy', 'locate', 'aunt', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'late', 'uncle', 'married', 'lost', 'Hiroshima', 'desperately', 'needed', 'structure', 'life', 'self-discipline', 'Japanese', 'swordsmanship', 'handy', 'when', 'truly', 'repulsive', 'man', 'honor', 'public', 'market', 'slob', 'hog', 'young', 'Hannibal', 'first', 'victim', 'head', 'removed', 'one', 'slice', 'neck.The', 'story', 'Death', 'Wish', 'tone', 'Hannibal', 'vigilante', 'locating', 'men', 'who', 'looted', 'home', 'killed', 'devoured', 'beloved', 'little', 'sister', 'man', 'mission', 'perverse', 'twists', 'events', 'story', 'lead', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'transformation', 'crusader', 'icy-eyed', 'sociopath', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'really', 'heavy', 'load', 'carry', 'rest', 'life.I', 'found', 'rooting', 'wholeheartedly', 'way', 'end', 'when', 'ultimate', 'shock', 'really', 'felt', 'bad', 'him.Thomas', 'Harris', 'compelling', 'writer', 'where', 'have', 'admit', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'based', 'have', 'read', 'others', 'series', 'even', 'many', 'points', 'novels', 'were', 'changed', 'deleted', 'still', 'truly', 'gripping', 'viewing']",N/A

1061149,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B000NVT0SE,barry,"[3, 3]","To begin a review of this film I think it is very important to acknowledge that it is is no way of the caliber of the Hannibal Lecter films with Anthony Hopkins and is in no way an intense psychological profile based horror film with deep characterizations.  It is in no way a SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Luckily, I came into this knowing the book and movie both got bad reviews so I had no expectations.  And this allowed me to watch this film and enjoy it as a separate entity from SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.The idea of seeing how the young Hannibal developed his desires and tastes for cruelty and sadistic murder is very intriguing and the plot certainly is overblown.  His family lived in Lithuania during the war and he watched his parents get killed and when he and his sister were alone, he saw soldiers invade the house and eventually devour his sister - supposedly in order to survive for they had no food.  Of course if a person viewed all this they would be affected for life.I found Gaspard Ulliel, who plays Hannibal, to have a very strong screen presence and totally believed his madness and the purpose of avenging the death of his sister as a reason/excuse to begin his avenging those who were a part of her death.  What was difficult for me was that he did not speak until he finds his way to the home of his aunt and when he finally spoke it was very quietly and he had a very strong accent that had no hint whatsoever of how Hannibal spoke later in life as played by Anthony Hopkins.  The introduction of the aunt causes some confusion in the script.  She teaches him martial arts and how to use swords.  We do see how he possesses this ability but we don't see why she taught him this.The last half of the film was excellent but not as a prequel explaining the true story of Hannibal Lecter but as an excellent horror film.  Each murder he commits is gruesome and very well filmed.  It is a quality horror film.  I believed his intensity and developing madness and was able to appreciate this film for what it was.If you watch this film thinking you will see an intriguing intro ino the madness of Hannibal Lecter of the quality of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS you will be greatly disappointed.  But as a horror movie in its own right it is excellently made.  The acting is all around very good, the scares are there and the gore is plentiful and utilized in believable ways.  I ended up really enjoying this film for what it was.Watch this with no more expectations than seing a fun, quality horror film that happens to have Hannibal Lecter in it.  The reasons for his desire to kill are fully explained but in a simple way but why his madness kept on evolving and he took pleasure in being a true monster is left alone.  You believe he is a monster but it is meant to just be accepted.",4,Very Good Horror Film - Nothing More,1223164800,"10 5, 2008",2008,2790,"['begin', 'review', 'film', 'think', 'very', 'important', 'acknowledge', 'way', 'caliber', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'films', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'way', 'intense', 'psychological', 'profile', 'based', 'horror', 'film', 'deep', 'characterizations', 'way', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'Luckily', 'came', 'knowing', 'book', 'movie', 'got', 'bad', 'reviews', 'had', 'expectations', 'allowed', 'watch', 'film', 'enjoy', 'separate', 'entity', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS.The', 'idea', 'seeing', 'how', 'young', 'Hannibal', 'developed', 'desires', 'tastes', 'cruelty', 'sadistic', 'murder', 'very', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'certainly', 'overblown', 'family', 'lived', 'Lithuania', 'war', 'watched', 'parents', 'get', 'killed', 'when', 'sister', 'were', 'alone', 'saw', 'soldiers', 'invade', 'house', 'eventually', 'devour', 'sister', 'supposedly', 'order', 'survive', 'had', 'food', 'course', 'person', 'viewed', 'would', 'be', 'affected', 'life.I', 'found', 'Gaspard', 'Ulliel', 'who', 'Hannibal', 'have', 'very', 'strong', 'screen', 'presence', 'totally', 'believed', 'madness', 'purpose', 'avenging', 'death', 'sister', 'reason/excuse', 'begin', 'avenging', 'who', 'were', 'part', 'death', 'What', 'was', 'difficult', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'speak', 'way', 'home', 'aunt', 'when', 'finally', 'spoke', 'was', 'very', 'quietly', 'had', 'very', 'strong', 'accent', 'had', 'hint', 'whatsoever', 'how', 'Hannibal', 'spoke', 'later', 'life', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'introduction', 'aunt', 'confusion', 'script', 'martial', 'arts', 'how', 'use', 'swords', 'do', 'see', 'how', 'ability', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'taught', 'this.The', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'excellent', 'not', 'prequel', 'explaining', 'true', 'story', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'excellent', 'horror', 'film', 'murder', 'gruesome', 'very', 'well', 'filmed', 'quality', 'horror', 'film', 'believed', 'intensity', 'developing', 'madness', 'was', 'able', 'appreciate', 'film', 'what', 'was.If', 'watch', 'film', 'thinking', 'will', 'see', 'intriguing', 'intro', 'ino', 'madness', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'quality', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'will', 'be', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'horror', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'excellently', 'made', 'acting', 'around', 'very', 'good', 'scares', 'are', 'there', 'gore', 'plentiful', 'utilized', 'believable', 'ways', 'ended', 'up', 'really', 'enjoying', 'film', 'what', 'was.Watch', 'more', 'expectations', 'seing', 'fun', 'quality', 'horror', 'film', 'have', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'reasons', 'desire', 'kill', 'are', 'fully', 'explained', 'simple', 'way', 'why', 'madness', 'kept', 'evolving', 'took', 'pleasure', 'being', 'true', 'monster', 'left', 'alone', 'believe', 'monster', 'meant', 'just', 'be', 'accepted']",N/A

Hannibal Lecter (Gaspard Urriel) is a young man w/ no goal in life, other than to avenge the cannibalistic death of his little sister, Mischa. His mind is set. His conscience is clear. His mission is absolute. Hannibal lives only to keep his promise to Mischa, and there will be much blood shed in the process. Learning the ways of the Samurai from his aunt, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li), Hannibal hones his skills in medical school, using cadavers as practice subjects. Human anatomy becomes Hannibal's roadmap in his quest for the most efficient methods of extermination. This will be very useful to him later on. Hannibal Lecter has grown up.

Didn't watch the movie until just now, purchased here through Prime Instant Video.  Acting superb, film editing A++++ (my big complaint about most films regards editing).  The movie strays from the book at key points, yet depends on you knowing the book.  You get a different idea of the story, if you've not read the book.  If you have, the 'straying' complements the book instead of contradicting it, especially with regard to certain elements in the book which weren't much explained.  Good to see them depicted, here.It is a brutal movie;  not gory, but the story line demands the brutality shown.  Good restraint in showing it, too.  Some moments were less-than-believable, but it didn't harm the viewing.  Key here is how people deal with trauma.  Like the other viewers, I hope to see a followup prequel covering the period between the end of this movie, up to where Red Dragon begins.I don't want to give away the plot.

One thing that I wished that the director might have done:  have the actors speak in the natural language of the particular countries and use English subtitles.  I think that that would have made it more realistic.  However, since I believe that the movie was filmed in Lithuania, France and perhaps Germany (at least according to the film), ""Hannibal Rising"" might have then become a foreign film, which most likely wasn't the intent.  It would have been interesting in some scenes, however, for actors to have spoken in their native tongue.I didn't like how the Hannibal Lecter character stretched out some of his murders.  This was not realistic to me, as most serial killers tend to take few risks and get things over in a hurry, and yes, I know there are exceptions.  I do understand that the director did this for dramatic effect, and that worked well sometimes; other times, not so much.  The ending in particular was a little grisly, and I would imagine that quite a few viewers would be turned off by that.  Most likely, real-life serial killers would actually even groan while watching that scene.I believe that the main theme of the film might be:  ""Evil begets evil.""  After all, something really evil happens to the young Hannibal at the beginning -- I won't say what that is since it might be an unnecessary giveaway -- and from then on, his entire existence appears to be just getting vengeance.  He is shown becoming a doctor at a very young age, and if the old doctors' mantra ""Do no harm"" should be followed, Hannibal is surely a poor example of that.A mixed bag for me, but overall, probably the second best film in the series.  That doesn't necessarily mean that it's very realistic, however, and it doesn't necessarily mean that it's any good.  And it's surely not for everyone.

1061164,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000NVT0SE,Chris Pandolfi,"[47, 55]","""Hannibal Rising"" is one of the darkest, most heavy-handed films I've ever seen. Yet I absolutely loved it. Even I don't understand why: the circumstances of the plot are ugly, focusing on the deepest, most disturbed recesses of the mind; a majority of the characters are malicious, having little if any regard for humanity; the visuals are more than a little difficult to watch, with disturbing scenes of torture and murder. Such unpleasant material doesn't easily make for an engrossing experience. Nonetheless, I found myself utterly fascinated, unable to avert my eyes from the screen. This is an engaging, shocking, beautifully photographed story of how the quest for vengeance can turn a hurt soul into a monster.Such a person is Hannibal Lecter, the cannibalistic criminal mastermind made famous by Anthony Hopkins in 1991's ""The Silence of the Lambs."" This new film chronicles Lecter's early descent into madness, beginning in 1944 with the deaths of his mother, father, and sister in war torn Lithuania (he was only a child then, no more than eight). While his parents were merely shot to death, his baby sister, Mischa (Helena Lia Tachovska), was targeted by a group of German soldiers using the Lecter family lodge as a hideout. Because of the lodge's remoteness, and because it's the dead of winter, the soldiers quickly discover that food is scarce. ""If we want to live,"" says Vladis Grutas (Rhys Ifans) as he savagely eats a puny rabbit, ""we must eat!"" That's when they all look over at the children, specifically at Mischa.The story then flashes forward eight years. Lecter is now a teenager (Gespard Ulliel), living in an orphanage that was once his family's castle. How tragic: what was once his home is now strictly controlled housing for hundreds of young men. As one might expect, he's not exactly popular among the other boys, especially since he remains silent during the day and screams every night as he dreams of his sister's death. There's some clever manipulation at work here; his painful childhood almost forces us to feel sympathy for the young Hannibal Lecter, even though we know he will eventually become a murderous lunatic. Is he truly insane, like the previous films would lead you to believe, or is he the unfortunate result of humanity's cruelty?No one can definitely answer those questions. All one can do is witness Lecter spiraling out of control, sinking further and further into the depths of hate. At some point, he promises his sister that he will find her murderers and make them pay. Such is the way with revenge: it clouds judgment, reason, and morality, and it leaves a void that cannot be filled, no matter what. Lecter fell victim to such a void as a child, which serves as his driving force for the rest of the film. He devises a plan to escape the orphanage. He then leaves for France and meets his Japanese aunt, Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Gong Li). They immediately bond despite his initial reluctance to speak. The bond is made stronger as he watches her pray to her ancestors; she bows in front of her father's samurai armor, seeking strength and courage.We know Lecter is seeking the same thing, especially since an emotional eruption is fast approaching. It finally arrives when he brutally murders a butcher using Murasaki's samurai sword. The butcher was intentionally crafted to be a despicable man; not only did he debase Murasaki, he had also aided the German's in transporting and exterminating Jews during the war. I can't say I felt sorry for him, which I suppose was the intended effect. The scene also establishes Lecter as a cold, calculating psychopath, a personality that's rarely indicative of a sympathetic character. But keep in mind that his family was needlessly murdered; who wouldn't be emotionally scarred by such a dark turn of events? I continuously questioned how I was supposed to feel about this character, even after he enrolls in a prestigious medical school in Paris. His main task, interestingly enough, is preparing cadavers for examination and experimentation.The story's morbidity increases dramatically as Lecter tracks down the German soldiers responsible for his sister's death. Unfortunately, executing his plan will not be as easy as he thought; hot on his trail is Inspector Popil (Dominic West), in charge of capturing and incarcerating war criminals. To some extent, he understands Lecter's pain. This is because he, too, lost family during the war. However, he's also a man of the law, and he refuses to let Lecter's vendetta against a group of soldiers slip through the cracks. The situation is also hard on Murasaki; her family was killed when Hiroshima was bombed. She finds herself torn between loving her nephew and desiring for inner peace.But for Lecter, absolutely everything is clear-cut; all he has left is the need for revenge, something that can never be alleviated even after the wrongdoers are caught. Having his way with the German soldiers makes for some uncomfortable moments, especially since they involve methods of torture that are best left unmentioned. I suppose you can understand why some will be turned off by this movie; as I've already said, it's a dark, dark story of cruelty, obsession, and pain. Writing this review still hasn't helped me to understand why I enjoyed ""Hannibal Rising"" so much. Maybe it's because I have a deeper understanding of a previously unknown character. True, Hannibal Lecter would go on to do terrible things. Still, I no longer view him as a loathsome monster. I now view him as a pitiable monster, made evil because of a deplorable environment.",5,Revenge is Best Served with Fava Beans and a Nice Chianti,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,5598,"['Hannibal',

But whereas most of us can relate so far...be forwarned that this gentleman likes eating PEOPLE!  Yikes.  I better watch my step reviewing this one or he may come after me!Note to Hannibal Lecter:  Please don't come after me.

It will totally creep you out in ways that the first one (Hannibal) did not.  I would still like to see the one with Jodie Foster in it too.I don't believe this movie is good for children under 7, but it does have an excellent message for all others which is that if you do the crime, you're gonna do the time.  Since the real-life Hannibal Lecter, according to news reports, is still out there on the loose, parents should probably take a few moments to sit with their younger kids and tell them to take a chill pill and relax--that Hannibal isn't into eating kids.  Of course maybe Hannibal Rising II will change all that.  I hope not!  Spooky.In summation, Hannibal Lecter should have his own show on the Food Network.

1061166,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B000NVT0SE,C. Middleton,"[9, 11]","It is a rare event indeed when a film adaptation surpasses the novel in just about all aspects.Although Thomas Harris penned the screenplay, when the last credits began to roll, my thought was that the book was merely an incidental, written with the ultimate goal in mind to put the story on the screen. This is a very well produced film, well paced with spectacular detail, and an outstanding performance by unknown, Gaspard Ulliel, capturing that sophisticated, pure evil which we have come to expect from the good doctor: a truly mesmerising performance as the character grows to understand his true nature.To be fair, the book was a sad disappointment, (see my review) making Hannibal into a card- board -cut- out- run-of-the-mill serial killer. It took a lot for me to spend the money to see the film, expecting the adaptation to fall short of the novel, thus when considering the blandness of the text, one would assume the film to be a disaster, not so in the least.Gong Li as Lady Murasaki Shikibu is not only stunning but her gentle expressions reveal a sensitive soul and one that truly cared for Hannibal, staging a cover-up for his first murder. Interestingly, it is here we discover Hannibal's prime motivation to kill: terribly rude people, and that poor French butcher, (a Nazi collaborator) after being extremely rude to Lady Shikibu, copped it from Hannibal in a cruel, slow and creative fashion. This was an extremely tense scene in the film, where we first witness Hannibal's creative and great love for the kill.In the film and the novel, including a mention in the last novel, `Hannibal', the reason the good doctor developed his tendency towards the eating of human flesh, still doesn't wash with me. The character is too complex, too intelligent, too self aware to suddenly carve out the delectable cheeks of his second victim and have a one-man barbecue. Harris should have researched a little harder and find what turns highly intelligent people into meat eaters of the human variety.Although the professional critics panned this film, compared with the novel, Hannibal Rising is a good story and a good and fitting contribution to Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs films... a wonderful surprise...a solid four star rating.",4,A great surprise...Hannibal has Risen,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,2248,"['rare', 'event', 'indeed', 'when', 'film', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'just', 'aspects.Although', 'Thomas', 'Harris', 'penned', 'screenplay', 'when', 'last', 'credits', 'began', 'roll', 'thought', 'was', 'book', 'was', 'merely', 'incidental', 'written', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'mind', 'put', 'story', 'screen', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'film', 'well', 'paced', 'spectacular', 'detail', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'unknown', 'Gaspard', 'Ulliel', 'capturing', 'sophisticated', 'pure', 'evil', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'good', 'doctor', 'truly', 'mesmerising', 'performance', 'character', 'understand', 'true', 'nature.To', 'be', 'fair', 'book', 'was', 'sad', 'disappointment', 'see', 'review', 'making', 'Hannibal', 'card-', 'board', '-cut-', 'out-', 'run-of-the-mill', 'serial', 'killer', 'took', 'lot', 'spend', 'money', 'see', 'film', 'expecting', 'adaptation', 'fall', 'short', 'novel', 'thus', 'when', 'considering', 'blandness', 'text', 'one', 'would', 'assume', 'film', 'be', 'disaster', 'not', 'so', 'least.Gong', 'Li', 'Lady', 'Murasaki', 'Shikibu', 'not', 'only', 'stunning', 'gentle', 'expressions', 'reveal', 'sensitive', 'soul', 'one', 'truly', 'cared', 'Hannibal', 'staging', 'cover-up', 'first', 'murder', 'Interestingly', 'here', 'discover', 'Hannibal', 'prime', 'motivation', 'kill', 'terribly', 'rude', 'people', 'poor', 'French', 'butcher', 'Nazi', 'collaborator', 'being', 'extremely', 'rude', 'Lady', 'Shikibu', 'copped', 'Hannibal', 'cruel', 'slow', 'creative', 'fashion', 'was', 'extremely', 'tense', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'first', 'witness', 'Hannibal', 'creative', 'great', 'love', 'kill.In', 'film', 'novel', 'including', 'mention', 'last', 'novel', 'Hannibal', 'reason', 'good', 'doctor', 'developed', 'tendency', 'eating', 'human', 'flesh', 'still', ""n't"", 'wash', 'character', 'too', 'complex', 'too', 'intelligent', 'too', 'aware', 'suddenly', 'carve', 'out', 'delectable', 'cheeks', 'second', 'victim', 'have', 'one-man', 'barbecue', 'Harris', 'should', 'have', 'researched', 'little', 'harder', 'find', 'what', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'people', 'meat', 'eaters', 'human', 'professional', 'critics', 'panned', 'film', 'compared', 'novel', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'fitting', 'contribution', 'Hannibal', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'films', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'solid', 'four', 'star', 'rating']",N/A

We see Hannibal and his sister Misha with their whole family in a rich, beautiful and loving family. As the movie begins director Peter Weber opens the movie to one of the most beautiful scenes in the woods by a lake with the Lecter Castle magically situated in the background. Hannibal and Misha are playing and we feel so close to these unknown children. They are giggling and laughing reminding me of days with one of my younger sisters who was too young to really communicate. Misha has such a wonderful innocence and trusting character that you wish she were your daughter.Tragedy quickly strikes as fast as lightening and we are swept up into a war with our wonderful Lecter family's get away. We wish them to move faster. They finally reach their cabin and war breaks out as they have all been told where to stand while Hannibal and Misha may stay in the house. Russian planes attack the opposing soldiers getting water from the cabin's well. A plane crash hits an object while other planes fire on any one they choose.Thus begins Hannibal's relentless protection of Misha as long as he can. Then the memories of life with Misha seems like a spike in Gaspard's heart as he searches for Misha's killers. Gaspard begins the construction of understanding Anthony Hopkins Oscar winning performance of the Hannibal we all know and hate/love.Every scene explains why Hopkins did this or that or how he knows fine things. Gaspard is highly intelligent and has no free time but to build on the rage burning in Gaspard from his childhood.This movie is thrilling to watch. My roommate and I know all the words. We have watched it at least 30 times and have enjoyed it more on each viewing. Tonight we listened to director Peter Weber and Ms De Laurentiis. They are just fantastic speakers concentrating on what we were seeing. I've listened to other directors who are lackluster or talk too much to their guests; we never learn the anatomy of each scene that we come upon.Like the movie HostelHostel (Unrated Widescreen Edition). Even though there are 4 director commentaries he talks too much about Hollywood and film making and we barely ever learn more than what we see. Commentaries have to become more informative and people friendly.Hannibal Rising is a masterpiece of collaborate effort and we have to thank it mostly to the wonderful writing of Thomas Harris. Now I'm tempted to read the book.See Hannibal Rising and discover how Gaspard grows up to be the horrific Anthony Hopkin's as Hannibal. Believe me this ties all the know-hows and reasons for all the Hannibal movies.Bravo to Gaspard Utilliel, Li Gong, and especially for Thomas Harris the writer and director Peter Weber.

What I got instead was more of a simple revenge story than the character study. Oh, yeah, we do learn some background of the famous ""Dr. Lector,"" but not enough of what really made him the weird combination of intellectual and cannibal.Although portraying and having someone in the film label the young adult as ""monster,"" the filmmakers (actually, author Thomas Harris) really made him more of a sympathetic character instead. They took the easiest road, out, too, making an easy target the villains: the Nazis. How often has Hollywood done that, even today 60 years after the conclusion of WWII. What we get is a revenge story of how Lector went from a child captive of the Nazis for a short time, to a medical student in Paris and how he tracked down the Nazis who killed the rest of his family.The best part of the film was the absolutely gorgeous cinematography.

Later at dinner at the long table in the ancient Dining Hall, Hannibal stares at his plate: some venison with a cranberry glaize. Some boiled, chopped carrots. A slab of whitefish. Peas. Leafy greens. He looks up at Mommy Lecter.""Mummy, am I a carrot?"" he asks. ""No darling.""""A pea?"" Not at all my sweet.""A potato?"" I think not. ""A little deer?"" Absolutely not, my darling Hannibal.""Then what am I, Mummy?"" the little boy wails, in a fit of bewilderment.""Why my sweet, sweet child, you're a little boy.

Ask director Peter Webber, he did it.LONG REVIEW, or, PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO EAT PEOPLE, ARE THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. The little nihlist spin Jon Demme gave ""The Phantom of the Opera"" could be summarized in three words: nasty, shocking, evil. When I first saw it, for a few weeks I recommended it be burned. The effect of that chicken-skin netherworld of inky-black grue was like standing in a meat locker and having a spitting black electric eel, its skin still slick with tepid water, dumped down your pants.""Silence of the Lambs"" felt like pure Evil because it was meant to: it was a bleak nightworld highway of Hell with no offramps. The audience was dumped into a world where sanity stood on its head. Hannibal Lecter, society psychiatrist, was the very epitome of that film's brutal wrongness: a finely concocted, meticulously educated, disarmingly sophisticated monster whose refinement only serves as a pressure cooker for the ferocity and savagery lurking just within the urbane exterior.Take any two minutes of grandmaster Anthony Hopkins's performance: it practically bristles a perfectly modulated, barely contained menace.That menace---that sense of a hinged trapped set to spring on naught but a muscle tremor---is totally absent in ""Hannibal Rising"": Young Sherlock Hannibal (French actor Gaspard Ulliel, who probably does a fine job when he's talking Frog) bristles with all the menace of a cow-eyed virgin schoolboy visiting Europe for the first time. The only time Ulliel really rises to the occasion is when he gets all jiggy with a samurai mask and sword. And then, only for a moment.And it's really not even poor Mr. Ulliel's fault that ""Hannibal Boring"" struggles to breathe and dies on the slab: more than anything it's the flick's whole schizophrenic struggle to humanize a guy who likes nothing better than a little Homo Sapiens pate with his champagne breakfest. Hey, who are we to judge! The SS ate his sister! Imagine what a little kidney-biting could have done for Schindler's List!Nor can you blame the screenwriter for the flaccid storyline: lay that at writer Thomas Harris's door, an author who hasn't had magic in his typewriter since, well, ever. Harris's backstory to his foodie supervillain was: Hannibal, budding Lithuanian aristocrat, has to deal with World War 2! Hannibal loses baby sister to some fascists with, uhm, diverse palates! Hannibal makes it through, baby! Hannibal gets even, along with a nice first edition copy of Julia Child's ""Joy of Cooking"".At the end of the day, though, ""Hannibal Sleeping"" fails because it spends all its time answering the most tiresome question of our dull Age: ""Why"". Asking ""Why?"" is a nice long drive up Nowhere Lane. Why did the big bad man capture a schoolbus full of little kids, cut them up into a million pieces, and airmail all the parts to Guam?Why is pointless: why not? (the central question in ""Silence of the Lambs"") is far more amusing. Why does there need to be a why? Sexuality leads us to the precipice from which we may view the futility of the question, where why is buried beneath thrashy seconds, minutes, hours, days of sweaty insanity and pheremonal depravity.Why? Because it feels good, Clarisse.Which can't be said of this flop. ""Hannibal Rising"" is zero red meat and lots of tofu, sprouts, and sushsi: fifteen minutes later and you'll be hungry again.JSG",1,Trying the Kids Menu---literally!,1204848000,"03 7,

However, it just doesn't ring true for me.  Here, Hannibal is on a righteous, if gruesome, mission to avenge the murder of his little sister, which provides an arc and dramatic sweep to his violence.  We never see him engaging in any of the childhood behaviors with have been pretty well established as classic precursors of serial killing, such as cruelty to animals.  When we contrast this with his behavior in earlier films, such as biting the face off a nurse who was leaning over him (referred to in ""Silence of the Lambs"") or killing and cooking a musician for hitting a bad note (""Red Dragon""), we are left to conclude that he must have developed a taste for murder as a result of his actions in this movie rather than his traumatic childhood.  Of course, I'm overanalyzing it.  The obvious reason for constructing the plot in this way is that the filmmakers want to build sympathy for Hannibal by rationalizing his despicable behavior as the product of a sensitive, hurt soul.  Actor Anthony Hopkins, ""Silence"" director Jonathan Demme, and even ""Red Dragon"" director Brett Ratner created a compelling character by making us fear Hannibal, not empathize with him.On its own terms, this is just an okay movie (albeit one that wastes the wonderful Gong Li as a ridiculous Japanese stereotype).

Having reviewed the ""novel""  (actually a poorly written novelization of the movie script) a few weeks back, I decided to rent the movie on cable.  First of all, not a single scene after the first twenty minutes or so (the Soviet and German combat) was even remotely plausable. Hannibal is able to  track down and kill the killers of his sister because one of them just happens to be an intelligence officer in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic  who just happens to be alerted that Hannibal is in Lithuania, and who just happens to find Hannibal on the grounds of his family's estate- Hannibal somehow manages to walk freely around all kinds of interesting area in the Police State of the Soviet Union.  At just the right moment the intelligence officer finds and tries to kill Hannibal. A minute earlier or a minute later and we probably have no movie (which would have been preferred).  Guess what- it gets worse!  Every character- except maybe the police inspector in France and possibly Lady Murasaki- is as one dimensional as the ideal line segment.  I could go on and on but I will just say this: Thomas Harris used to be a very good writer.  Black Sunday, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs were all very good novels. Everything following is cartoonish nonsense.

But that's how Hannibal deals with it.Just like the Anthony Hopkins Hannibal manages - through the horrors of what he does - to sort of be likeable in a weird way, so was this young guy.  Lecter never harms children or animals (see below), for example.  I guess what makes him a ""monster"" in his world's eyes is that he acts on his desire for revenge.  And once he got a taste (no pun intended), he never could stop.Later in life, the issue wasn't revenge. So what was it? In ALL the movies, even he has boundaries.  And we love him for it.  He only ""eats the rude.""

He chopped off his hand to spare her...which makes him all the more endearing)3) Kids and animals are off limits, if I recall right (though he did feed human brain to a child...okay, that is bad.

This film, however, is the very weakest of them.  It was beautifully filmed, however, it just didn't do it for me, I can't really explain why.  Maybe because it was more like a war movie or the great Anthony Hopkins was not in it.  However, this was about the young Lecter, so Hopkins, couldn't have been in it.  The surround sound was unbelievable and during the war scenes, I heard gun fire and explosions from everywhere, like I was there.The movie does give us a glimpse of why Hannibal turned out the way he did.  His parents were wiped out by the Nazis during World War II and his young sister (Misha) killed and eaten by starving soldiers.  He was the only member of his family to survive and he received no mental counseling.  Hannibal grows up to seek revenge on all those involved with Misha's death.A friend of mine, CLINT BRONSON, placed a comment on one of my reviews, Red Dragon (a great film in the Hannibal Lecter series) that stated, ""These are movies that are great for school bullies to watch. For they pick on a kid who is weaker or a nerd. But the kid grows up! And likes knives and never forgives!""  I didn't know what he meant at the time and questioned the comment, but he should have told me to watch this movie and that would explain.  I must apologize CLINT, for not understanding your comment.  For this truly is a movie for school bullies to watch.  Hannibal does get revenge on those who wronged him and his family.While I was very disappointed in this film---it does explain Hannibal's mental state and why he commits those atrocious killings and you should watch all of the series in sequence starting with this one, then Manhunter, Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.",2,Very disappointing...,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,1843,"['movie', 'prequel', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'love', 'whole', 'series', 'diabolical', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'M.D..', 'film', 'however', 'very', 'weakest', 'was', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'however', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'why', 'Maybe', 'was', 'more', 'war', 'movie', 'great', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'was', 'not', 'However', 'was', 'young', 'Lecter', 'so', 'Hopkins', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'surround', 'sound', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'war', 'scenes', 'heard', 'gun', 'fire', 'explosions', 'everywhere', 'was', 'there.The', 'movie', 'give', 'glimpse', 'why', 'Hannibal', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'did', 'parents', 'were', 'wiped', 'out', 'Nazis', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'young', 'sister', 'Misha', 'killed', 'eaten', 'starving', 'soldiers', 'was', 'only', 'member', 'family', 'survive', 'received', 'mental', 'counseling', 'Hannibal', 'up', 'seek', 'revenge', 'involved', 'Misha', 'death.A', 'friend', 'mine', 'CLINT', 'BRONSON', 'placed', 'comment', 'one', 'reviews', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'great', 'film', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'series', 'stated', 'are', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'school', 'bullies', 'watch', 'pick', 'kid', 'who', 'weaker', 'nerd', 'kid', 'up', 'knives', 'never', 'forgives', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'meant', 'time', 'questioned', 'comment', 'should', 'have', 'told', 'watch', 'movie', 'would', 'explain', 'must', 'apologize', 'CLINT', 'not', 'understanding', 'comment', 'truly', 'movie', 'school', 'bullies', 'watch', 'Hannibal', 'get', 'revenge', 'who', 'wronged', 'family.While', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'film', '-it', 'explain', 'Hannibal', 'mental', 'state', 'why', 'atrocious', 'killings', 'should', 'watch', 'series', 'sequence', 'starting', 'one', 'then', 'Manhunter', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Hannibal']",N/A

Where this version of how the child Hannibal became the crazed and bizarre man due to his witnessing the loss of his young sister to the appetites of hungry soldiers is less successful than the studies of the grown man is the lack of including the genius mind, epicurean stance, highly sophisticated art lover, and macabre sense of human relationships as shown in the boy to young man period.Filmed in beautiful color and atmosphere the story begins in WW II as stated above and as Hannibal the lad escapes the carnivorous appetites of the Nazi solders (including the evil Grutas as portrayed with gusto by Rhys Ifans!) and becomes Hannibal the young man (Gaspard Ulliel) who with the aid of his aunt Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Gong Li) continues to search out all of the soldiers who ate his sister.  And in the end we do discover some hidden secrets about the now mature Hannibal Lecter.Director Peter Webber keeps the pace and the gore going and has at his side a fine supporting cast (Richard Brake, Kevin McKidd, Stephen Walters,  Ivan Marevich, and Goran Kostic among others).  Ulliel is credible in the minimal dialog is given and it probably is the fault of Thomas Harris that this young Hannibal doesn't show all the key characteristics he will eventually flaunt.

1061209,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000NVT0SE,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","The book was perfect, the film is even more perfect than perfect. It is exactly what we could have dreamed of. The story is the absolute logical explanation of the previous volumes about Hannibal Lecter and we cannot think of one detail in these earlier volumes that is not the direct consequence of what happens in this later volume that tells the infancy, teenage and youth of Hannibal Lecter. What makes it so fascinatingly believable is that this period of his life is situated in Lithuania during the war and in the Soviet union and in France after the war. The political elements, allusions or direct references are correct even if at times slightly simplified, for instance the butcher, the first victim of Hannibal Lecter's on the French territory, who was a collaborator during the war and took part in the sending of some Jews to deportation could go on with his profession in spite of the hatred he had accumulated among people because as a butcher he must have taken part in a lot of black market operations and most post war higher ups or councilors and representatives in his zone must have used his services in a way or another during the war, to sell the meat they produced on their farms or to buy the meat they could not have with the food coupons. But that lack of precision is already in the book. But a little bit of research on such a point, and others, would have made the film even more believable. The man Hannibal Lecter, and his psychology are really clarified. He was traumatized by what he went through and he never managed to get out of it, to forget it, to forgive the criminals, etc. But is a man that resilient to be able to forgive and forget seeing his own younger sister being cooked in her own copper bathtub and then eaten by a bunch of wild human beasts? I guess we would like to think so. But what we are sure of is that no matter how much you forget something, that thing remains in your mind and can manipulate you any time anywhere unconsciously. All people who suffer such traumas do not become criminals but most of them have some blank moments and their general attitude is either one of distantiation or one of extreme orthodoxy along some ethical or ideological line. For example we have not really thought of the impact of the torturing and execution of the early Christians on the very corpus of their beliefs and principles. How can some persecuted group defend the principle of loving their enemies who are putting them to death in atrocious ways everyday?  That is what this film is all about and it shows how relentless the victim of such violence can become, and that is not vengeance. It is justice in the eye of plain humanity, in the eye of what they have suffered, in the eye of God even. But the good question remains to know where the police, or more generally the forces that are supposed to defend law, order, justice, freedom and many other principles, were at the time of the crimes. No one can answer even when one war criminal of that type is caught up like Papon in France who was tried in the late 1990s for crimes against humanity he committed in Bordeaux in 1944 after a complete career in the top administration or the government of the country. He was the police and the direct representative of the state in Bordeaux hence law and order in 1944. The problem we have to solve is then what do we do for these people who suffered such horrible crimes after the end of the period concerned. What do we do with the victims of the war in Iraq, both American GIs who come back completely disturbed and Iraqis who are going to be haunted by what they suffered for decades. There is no easy answer to that question.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,No crime against humanity can go unpunished,1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,3816,"['book', 'was', 'perfect', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'perfect', 'perfect', 'exactly', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'dreamed', 'story', 'absolute', 'logical', 'explanation', 'previous', 'volumes', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'one', 'detail', 'earlier', 'volumes', 'not', 'direct', 'consequence', 'what', 'later', 'volume', 'infancy', 'teenage', 'youth', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'What', 'so', 'fascinatingly', 'believable', 'period', 'life', 'situated', 'Lithuania', 'war', 'Soviet', 'union', 'France', 'war', 'political', 'elements', 'allusions', 'direct', 'references', 'are', 'correct', 'even', 'times', 'slightly', 'simplified', 'instance', 'butcher', 'first', 'victim', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'French', 'territory', 'who', 'was', 'collaborator', 'war', 'took', 'part', 'sending', 'Jews', 'deportation', 'could', 'go', 'profession', 'spite', 'hatred', 'had', 'accumulated', 'people', 'because', 'butcher', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'part', 'lot', 'black', 'market', 'operations', 'most', 'post', 'war', 'higher', 'ups', 'councilors', 'representatives', 'zone', 'must', 'have', 'used', 'services', 'way', 'war', 'sell', 'meat', 'produced', 'farms', 'buy', 'meat', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'food', 'coupons', 'lack', 'precision', 'already', 'book', 'little', 'bit', 'research', 'point', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'believable', 'man', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'psychology', 'are', 'really', 'clarified', 'was', 'traumatized', 'what', 'went', 'never', 'managed', 'get', 'forget', 'forgive', 'criminals', 'etc', 'man', 'resilient', 'be', 'able', 'forgive', 'forget', 'seeing', 'own', 'younger', 'sister', 'being', 'cooked', 'own', 'copper', 'bathtub', 'then', 'eaten', 'bunch', 'wild', 'human', 'beasts', 'guess', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'so', 'what', 'are', 'sure', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'forget', 'something', 'thing', 'mind', 'can', 'manipulate', 'time', 'anywhere', 'unconsciously', 'people', 'who', 'suffer', 'such', 'traumas', 'do', 'not', 'become', 'criminals', 'most', 'have', 'blank', 'moments', 'general', 'attitude', 'one', 'distantiation', 'one', 'extreme', 'orthodoxy', 'ethical', 'ideological', 'line', 'example', 'have', 'not', 'really', 'thought', 'impact', 'torturing', 'execution', 'early', 'Christians', 'very', 'corpus', 'beliefs', 'principles', 'How', 'can', 'persecuted', 'group', 'defend', 'principle', 'loving', 'enemies', 'who', 'are', 'putting', 'death', 'atrocious', 'ways', 'everyday', 'what', 'film', 'how', 'relentless', 'victim', 'such', 'violence', 'can', 'become', 'not', 'vengeance', 'justice', 'eye', 'plain', 'humanity', 'eye', 'what', 'have', 'suffered', 'eye', 'God', 'even', 'good', 'question', 'know', 'where', 'police', 'more', 'generally', 'forces', 'are', 'supposed', 'defend', 'law', 'order', 'justice', 'freedom', 'many', 'other', 'principles', 'were', 'time', 'crimes', 'one', 'can', 'answer', 'even', 'when', 'one', 'war', 'criminal', 'type', 'caught', 'up', 'Papon', 'France', 'who', 'was', 'tried', 'late', '1990s', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'committed', 'Bordeaux', '1944', 'complete', 'career', 'top', 'administration', 'government', 'country', 'was', 'police', 'direct', 'representative', 'state', 'Bordeaux', 'hence', 'law', 'order', '1944', 'problem', 'have', 'solve', 'then', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'people', 'who', 'suffered', 'such', 'horrible', 'crimes', 'end', 'period', 'concerned', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'victims', 'war', 'Iraq', 'American', 'GIs', 'who', 'come', 'back', 'completely', 'disturbed', 'Iraqis', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'haunted', 'what', 'suffered', 'decades', 'easy', 'answer', 'question.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

Gaspard Ulliel plays Hannibal Lector who wants revenge on starving soldiers who ate his little sister right in front of him when he was young. Once he starts killing he starts to enjoy it a little too much.The movie plays a little like Batman Begins. He gets some training in the way of the sword. Then all of a sudden he's ready to be a killer and it comes easy to him. ""Spoiler"", he kills a guy that disrepects a woman he has feelings for. She's even a bit out there, she acts as if receiving the head is like getting a dosen roses and says ""you shouldn't have done this for me"".Things like that are a bit silly but Gaspard Ulliel still does a good job carrying the movie as Hannibal Lector even if he is no Anthony Hopkins. His expressions basically make his performance though. He has fun in the movie playing Hannibal and throwing out one-liners here and there. But I doubt viewers will have as much of a good time with all the over the top violence. So for that I can only mildly recommend this movie. Also eventhough Gaspard faired well as Hannibal, I rather see Anthony Hopkins back one more time to make a better movie than Hannibal.

1061217,A72A8JDQK4D8S,B000NVT0SE,John A. Lind,"[0, 0]","There are a number of things that can result in a dog pile of critics ganging up on a film to trash it. One of them is production problems, notably over budget and over schedule. Examples: Cimino's &#34;Heaven's Gate&#34; and more recently &#34;The Lone Ranger.&#34; Seems that many critics feel compelled to exact revenge and inflict punishment on a troubled film and its director on behalf of the film industry.Another is what occurred with this film. Rumor on the street is Dino De Laurentis, the producer heavily involved with the last three films in the Lecter &#34;franchise&#34; coerced the novel series author, Thomas Harris, to write a fourth prequel novel, and then do the screenplay for this film (or De Laurentis would find someone else to do it). I have no idea whether that's true or not, but have little doubt a good portion of the thrashing this film has suffered at the hands (pens) of critics has more to do with that than the merits of the film itself.Overview of Lithuania, 1918-1953 (skip this if you know the history):The country was steamrollered by invading armies three times during WWII, first by the Soviets (1940), then by the Germans (1941), and finally by the Soviets again (1944; they didn't leave until 1993). It's a Nordic-Baltic country on the eastern side of the Baltic sea, across from Sweden and Denmark. During the rise of the Russian Empire, it was sucked by the end of the 18th Century along with Estonia, Latvia and Finland, the first two being the other smaller countries along the Baltic. Look at maps of the former Russian Empire and the former Soviet Union. The massive country was nearly landlocked. A major part of their strategic importance was an outlet to the Baltic. At the end of WWI in 1918 with the Russian revolution, Lithuania successfully declared its independence from Russia and was able to maintain it. This continued until 1939 with the secret Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact that partitioned Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union. Part of that deal that isn't widely known was the Soviet Union being allowed to occupy Lithuania without German intervention. The Soviet Union invades Lithuania in 1940 and annexes it, brutally wreaking havoc on Lithuanians to properly collectivize and &#34;Sovietize&#34; them. A year later in June 1941, Germany launches Operation Barbarossa, their invasion of the Soviet Union, which includes invading and occupying what had been Lithuania a year earlier. They proceed to wreak havoc on the civil population, especially the Jews and anyone suspected of having been a Soviet &#34;collaborator.&#34; In 1944, Germany retreats from the Baltic and the Soviet Union invades again, only to wreak havoc once more with revenge on anyone remotely suspected of collaborating or even sympathizing with the Germans. After the war, Lithuania remained part of the Soviet Union, sold down the river by Churchill and Roosevelt by pointedly failing to address the three Baltic states (Estonia and Latvia the other two) in the Yalta Conference. Large numbers of highly organized partisans with uniforms, insignia and formal rank/command structure continued to pursue an effective revolt against Soviet occupation until about 1953 when resistance finally fell apart, although it continued in very small numbers into the 1960's. The historical aspect of the film's Lithuanian setting in WWII is sufficiently accurate; it isn't about the war per se, but about what the rogue German armed Lithuanian partisans did as the Soviets reoccupied the country in 1944.The film uses WWII and what occurred in Lithuania to provide the backdrop and horrific events with the rest of his immediate family (mother, father and younger sister) that set Hannibal Lecter on his psychopathic trajectory as a serial killer. We get to see him as a young boy during WWII that ultimately travels from Lithuania through Eastern Europe, through West Germany and ultimately to the widow of his uncle in France. Initially he cannot consciously remember what occurred at the family lodge in Lithuania. While in France under the care of his aunt, he begins medical school and eventually is able to consciously remember the events that killed his family, setting him on a course of revenge that continues to the end of the film. There is a time gap between this film and Red Dragon, but it's not difficult to fill it with the list of serial killings in the ongoing investigation revealed at the beginning of Red Dragon. Knowing more than that wouldn't be of much benefit to Hannibal Rising as it already provides more than enough to fully understand the root cause of Lecter's psychopathy. There's plenty of material for empathy with Lecter, if one chooses to feel it. There are also plenty of horrifically abhorrent acts to revile. That's where I believe the strength of this film lies: a character whose childhood experiences and desire for revenge can evoke strong empathy combined with his revoltingly repulsive acts of revenge.",4,Excellent Prequel -- Unfairly Bashed By Critics,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,4974,"['are', 'number', 'things', 'can', 'result', 'dog', 'pile', 'critics', 'ganging', 'up', 'film', 'trash',

That's just me to me it is a trilogy Manhunter Silence Of The Lambs & Hannibal. Hannibal Rising directed by Peter Webber who I hope this is the only movie I ever watch that you have directed. Thomas Harris himself wrote the screen play & Dino De Laurntiis produces for the last time. It stars Gaspard Ulliel as a Young Hannibal & Lo Gong as Murasaki there the only decent thing about this movie  the dumb a  s  s who played Jigsaw in Punisher War Zone Dominic West in this. You start off in 1944 the Lecter family during the end of WW II in Lithuania the whole family is killed except for Hanninbal & his little sister SS forces cannibalize the girl. Hannibal is later found by Soviet Forces the Lecter Castle has been turned into an orphange 8 years later Hannibal has been rendared mute due to tramatic experances & later escapes to Paris to live with his Aunt she helps him speak again. We get Hannibal going for revenge Crow or Punisher style I'm sorry but I'm supppose to care about this character I know it is a prequel but this character who would go on to serve human to party guests drove Will Graham to insanity had Dr Chilton for dinner savaged the gaurds in Silence cooked Ray Liotta's brain which we will never forget for different reasons & we are suppose to pity poor Hannibal. The Boogeyman should remain The Boogeyman the tramatic childhood stuff worked for Francis Dollarhyde & Jame Gumb but it doesn't for Hannibal. It is just what it is cliche. This movie is so slow paced & I don't mind slow paced movies as long as the characters keep me involved but out of all 5 films this has the most forgettable character & forgetable score. I guess I can say it is shot well but so was The NOES remake & I don't think much of Samuel Bayer as a director.

I don't want to lose this franchise & the audience they want it."" It was made out of greed. Harris shouldn't of done it he wouldn't have had to take the blame for a s h i  t t y novel.

1061229,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000NVT0SE,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 3]","In the history of cinema there are many great cinematic villains that have terrified movie audiences over the years. Often times they are frightening in appearance or deeds, sometimes they are misunderstood or victims of circumstance, and they can even be so captivating that you can't help but pay attention to their many evil acts. These great villains range from the dreaded Darth Vader, to the slashers known as Freddy, Jason, and Leatherface, or the brilliant evil genius' of the James Bond films, to the most feared psychological villain of all time, Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter. Moviemakers lately have felt the need to explain the origins to some of cinema's classic villains from George Lucas' prequel trilogy of 'Star Wars' films, to Leatherface's lackluster origin story in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"", the most recent addition to the list of villains getting the origin treatment would be Hannibal Lecter in the Weinstein Company's adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel, ""Hannibal Rising"".""Hannibal Rising"" is the origin story of Hannibal Lecter, showing how he went from being an innocent young boy in Lithuania to society's most deadly, cannibalistic serial killer. As a young boy in Lithuania, Hannibal witnessed the deaths of his parents in World War 2, leaving he and his sister Mischa to fend for themselves. Just when Hannibal thought things couldn't get worse, a group of militia men invade their home, taking Hannibal and Mischa hostage. Soon, food begins to become sparse, and the militia gets desperate and chooses to survive by taking Mischa's life for food. Some time after that, grown up and in college, Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel), is mastering every course he takes, and well on his way to earning his doctorate. Little does his professors know that Hannibal hides a dark, deadly secret. In his own time he is obsessively pursuing the men that formed the militia that took his sister's life, and if there's one thing Hannibal intends to do when he finds them, it's take his pound of flesh for their crime.The decision to make a prequel to the popular Hannibal Lecter trilogy of films seemed like a waste of time and space, simply a way for the studio to just cash in on the character's well-known name. Which left me feeling like this would be a pathetic movie, because more than likely not a single person associated with the previous films would be involved, and for the most part I was right on that count, but there was a glimmer of a chance that this movie would be more than expected. Shortly after the film was greenlit, it was announced that the movie was being written by none other than Thomas Harris, the creator of Hannibal Lecter, based on his novel of the same name that he was in the process of finishing up. With that prospect, I thought that ""Hannibal Rising"" (at the time the movie was being called ""Young Hannibal"") just may stand a chance of equaling its predecessors in terms of quality storytelling and acting that is among the best Hollywood has to offer.Well, as good of a writer Thomas Harris is, or I should say was (his other three books in the Lecter series are great works of fiction), this novel and the screenplay that was based on it are far inferior to anything offered in the other installments. I was disappointed by the movie for several reasons; first I felt the actor chosen to portray young Hannibal was only okay. I understand he was trying to only give hints as to what this character will become later on, and I'll give it to the actor, there were a couple of times that I saw a glimpse of Anthony Hopkins' creepy portrayal seep in, but these were few and far between. For the most part the actor was just flat in his performance and apparently the only expression he really knew how to make was a snarl, he didn't really have any of the nuances that Anthony perfected in this character. Second, it seemed like Hannibal took to cannibalism a little too easily. I understand that he saw his sister suffer at the hands of evil militia men, and seeing that would definitely scar a young child, but when he kills the first soldier and commits his first act of cannibalism, there is no uncertainty or disdain for what he's doing. He simply does the deed, doesn't appear to be bothered by it, in fact he may even have enjoyed it (the movie really doesn't explain this), and moves on in search of the next victim on his list. Which brings me to my third problem with this movie; aside from revenge being his motive for killing the killers of his sister, he doesn't show any further conviction to commit murder. Leaving one to wonder why he continued after achieving his vengeance, did committing all those acts of murder and cannibalism become such an obsession for him outside of revenge that he just felt compelled to do more or what? This was an aspect that wasn't explained, and I felt should have been, especially since this was to be the origin of his evil life and a deep psychological profile into the why of his life of crime. Instead, Thomas Harris' screenplay and novel barely scratched the surface, no doubt because the Weinstein's are hoping to cash in on further installments of prequels, since Hopkins is probably through portraying the character. And my final complaint would have to be that there was no cameo by Anthony Hopkins, the least they could have done was bring him in during the final moments of the film to link it in to the other three. Instead, he gets his revenge, the story ends, and the credits roll. Nothing linking it in to the other films, aside from the name of the lead character.""Hannibal Rising"" is not the worst film ever made, it's actually an average movie, and if it was the first in the series to be made, it may have seemed better, but when comparing it to the other three already in the franchise, it pales in comparison. The other movies contained many psychological aspects to them, especially ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""Red Dragon"" and ""Hannibal"" did to an extent just not as much, but this film didn't contain any. There was potential, especially given that Hannibal endured a horrific childhood which is the root of his evil, but aside from a few dream sequences we don't get much insight into his character, and the dreams only serve to show us exactly what the militia did to him and his sister. Which is probably where the biggest problem of this film lies, is that in trying to explain why Hannibal is who he is, the makers of the film try to make the audience feel sympathy for him. This is one of modern cinema's greatest movie villains, I don't want to feel sorry for him, I want to see what made him who he is. The filmmakers tried to accomplish the why of the character, but went about it wrong, all they explained was why he was killing the militia, it never explained why he felt the need to continue killing other people that weren't involved in his sister's death. So, because of that the audience feels that his killing is justified, at least in this movie (it's just a really sick brand of justice), and in doing so you sympathize with him. What this all boils down to is that the filmmakers, especially Thomas Harris, really dropped the ball on explaining the origin of Hannibal Lecter, opting simply to give audiences an average revenge tale, just a little gorier than most.""Hannibal Rising"" is unrated containing violence, gore, and language.",2,It Started With Revenge and Ends With Disappointment...,1183075200,"06 29,

There's nothing in this movie that remotely hints at the sophisticated genius and savage animal that both grow within Hannibal at equal measure.

His relationship with Starling herself was one that bordered on something between paternal and collegial as though she were a rare find of a colleague.

1061246,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000NVT0SE,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[0, 0]","It's hard to review ""Hannibal Rising"" without taking into consideration the other films in the franchise.  UnlikeBatman Begins, which can and does stand apart from its batty bretheren, this film's punch relies in many ways on the Lecter mythos, much to its detriment.I suppose you could attempt to view the movie as an isolated incident, a self-contained story, but that would be both wrong-headed and, for anyone who knows anything aboutThe Silence of the Lambs, virtually impossible.  Besides, even if you could take away expectations and biases from the viewing experience, you still end up with a pretty watered down treatise on what makes a monster.Much like Showtime's deliciously dark seriesDexter, ""Hannibal Rising"" hopes to show us how serial killers are born.  Their answers aren't that different: a mind-boggingly horrific childhood experience combined with the tutelage of a fighting/killing master.  Dexter's seemed a bit more plausible -- he was adopted by a police officer who sagely tried to channel Dexter's murderous tendencies into more productive veins; Hannibal, on the other hand, is taken under the wing of his obscenely wealthy Aunt, Lady Murasaki, a sexy Japanese immigrant who teaches Hannibal the arts of sword play and flower arranging and why it's okay to make out with your aunt if she's only a relative by marriage.  Also, her chef gives Hannibal lots of great cooking advice.  ""The cheeks are the best part of an animal!""  Hannibal does not have to ask which cheeks the chef is talking about; I would've.Hannibal's childhood trauma involves the grisly death of his sister at the hands of war profiteering Lithuanians.  The rest of the movie follows Hannibal as he exacts his vengance on these men, who are still pretty bad guys.  I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say this: it's a prequel, so if you're guessing that Hannibal gets away scott free, you're on the right track.Under normal circumstances, I'd be compelled to give a movie like this three stars instead of two, but ""Hannibal Rising"" does such a thorough job of squeezing all of the sick mystery out of the character of Lecter that I found the whole experience rather patronizing.  Part of what makes Lecter such a fabulous anti-hero is that he is essentially unknowable.  The darkest and most disturbing element of his personality isn't his amazing intelligence, his erudite charm, or his transcedentally creepy calm.  It is the fact that his reasons are his own to know, and only for us to guess at.""Hannibal Rising"" not only removes the mystique from the man, but it also reduces his actions to those of sullen kid.  Hannibal is not the anti-hero in this movie; he's the actual, legitimate hero, and the label doesn't suit the character, at least not as he's ever been portrayed in any other film.  It turns him into a puppet that's holding its own strings.  Even worse, the film insultingly holds the audiences hands through some of its weightier images.  When Hannibal passes through an open-air butcher market or when he sees a bracelet that his sister used to wear, we are treated to flashbacks of Hannibal's last moments with his sister, as if we can't already guess on our own the connections to be made.The closest thing to Foster's Clarice here is Inspector Popil, a man smart enough to know that Hannibal is responsible for the sudden outbreak of beheadings and cheek eatings.  The victim of his own fair share of war crimes, Popil even sympathizes with what makes Hannibal kill, but he has, of course, chosen the path of law and order.  Hannibal respected Clarice's weaknesses as they could be found in the virtues she chose to valiantly uphold.  That respect is missing here, and so the character of Popil remains woefully unused, his status relegated to that of a narrative mouthpiece.  ""That young boy died out there with his sister,"" Popil says.  ""What came out of that woods was no longer human.  It was ... a monster!""If you say so.  Gaspard Ulliel's portrayal of Hannibal does have hints of ""monster"" about it, but it lacks depth and coherency.  He spends much of the movie grinning quietly and looking at people out of the corners of his eyes.  It's all well and good, I suppose, but you'll get the impression that something's missing.  What's missing is the uncertainty, the creepiness, the indefinable menace that made the man such a great character.  It's been said that we hate most the things we understand most; Hannibal's not hard to figure out in this film.  I guess it's fair to say that that doesn't necessarily make it a hate-worthy film, but it does make it boring.",2,Psycho Babble,1184630400,"07 17, 2007",2007,4606,"['hard', 'review', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'taking', 'consideration', 'other', 'films', 'franchise', 'UnlikeBatman', 'Begins', 'can', 'stand', 'apart', 'batty', 'bretheren', 'film', 'punch', 'relies', 'many', 'ways', 'Lecter', 'mythos', 'much', 'detriment.I', 'suppose', 'could', 'attempt', 'view', 'movie', 'isolated', 'incident', 'self-contained', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'wrong-headed', 'anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'aboutThe', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'even', 'could', 'take', 'away', 'expectations', 'biases', 'viewing', 'experience', 'still', 'end', 'up', 'pretty', 'watered', 'down', 'treatise', 'what', 'monster.Much', 'Showtime', 'deliciously', 'dark', 'seriesDexter', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'show', 'how', 'serial', 'killers', 'are', 'born', 'answers', 'are', ""n't"", 'different', 'mind-boggingly', 'horrific', 'childhood', 'experience', 'combined', 'tutelage', 'fighting/killing', 'master', 'Dexter', 'seemed', 'bit', 'more', 'plausible', 'was', 'adopted', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'sagely', 'tried', 'channel', 'Dexter', 'murderous', 'tendencies', 'more', 'productive', 'veins', 'Hannibal', 'other', 'hand', 'taken', 'wing', 'obscenely', 'wealthy', 'Aunt', 'Lady', 'Murasaki', 'sexy', 'Japanese', 'immigrant', 'who', 'Hannibal', 'arts', 'sword', 'play', 'flower', 'arranging', 'why', 'okay', 'make', 'out', 'aunt', 'only', 'relative', 'marriage', 'Also', 'chef', 'Hannibal', 'lots', 'great', 'cooking', 'advice', 'cheeks', 'are', 'best', 'part', 'animal', 'Hannibal', 'not', 'have', 'ask', 'chef', 'talking', ""would've.Hannibal"", 'childhood', 'trauma', 'grisly', 'death', 'sister', 'hands', 'war', 'profiteering', 'Lithuanians', 'rest', 'movie', 'Hannibal', 'vengance', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'pretty', 'bad', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'will', 'say', 'prequel', 'so', ""'re"", 'guessing', 'Hannibal', 'away', 'scott', 'free', ""'re"", 'right', 'track.Under', 'normal', 'circumstances', ""'d"", 'be', 'compelled', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'instead', 'two', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'thorough', 'job', 'squeezing', 'sick', 'mystery', 'character', 'Lecter', 'found', 'whole', 'experience', 'rather', 'patronizing', 'Part', 'what', 'Lecter', 'fabulous', 'anti-hero', 'essentially', 'unknowable', 'darkest', 'most', 'disturbing', 'element', 'personality', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'intelligence', 'erudite', 'charm', 'transcedentally', 'creepy', 'calm', 'fact', 'reasons', 'are', 'own', 'know', 'only', 'guess', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'not', 'only', 'mystique', 'man', 'also', 'actions', 'sullen', 'kid', 'Hannibal', 'not', 'anti-hero', 'movie', 'actual', 'legitimate', 'hero', 'label', ""n't"", 'suit', 'character', 'least', 'not', 'ever', 'been', 'portrayed', 'other', 'film', 'puppet', 'holding', 'own', 'strings', 'Even', 'worse', 'film', 'insultingly', 'audiences', 'weightier', 'images', 'When', 'Hannibal', 'passes', 'open-air', 'butcher', 'market', 'when', 'bracelet', 'sister', 'used', 'wear', 'are', 'treated', 'flashbacks', 'Hannibal', 'last', 'moments', 'sister', 'ca', ""n't"", 'already', 'guess', 'own', 'connections', 'be', 'made.The', 'closest', 'thing', 'Foster', 'Clarice', 'here', 'Inspector', 'Popil', 'man', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'Hannibal', 'responsible', 'sudden', 'outbreak', 'beheadings', 'cheek', 'eatings', 'victim', 'own', 'fair', 'share', 'war', 'crimes', 'Popil', 'even', 'what', 'Hannibal', 'kill', 'course', 'chosen', 'path', 'law', 'order', 'Hannibal', 'respected', 'Clarice', 'weaknesses', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'virtues', 'chose', 'valiantly', 'uphold', 'respect', 'missing', 'here', 'so', 'character', 'Popil', 'woefully', 'unused', 'status', 'relegated', 'narrative', 'mouthpiece', 'young', 'boy', 'died', 'there', 'sister', 'Popil', 'What', 'came', 'out', 'woods', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'human', 'was', 'monster', 'say', 'so', 'Gaspard', 'Ulliel', 'portrayal', 'Hannibal', 'have', 'hints', 'monster', 'depth', 'coherency', 'much', 'movie', 'grinning', 'quietly', 'looking', 'people', 'corners', 'eyes', 'well', 'good', 'suppose', ""'ll"", 'get', 'impression', 'something', 'missing', 'What', 'missing', 'uncertainty', 'creepiness', 'indefinable', 'menace', 'made', 'man', 'great', 'character', 'been', 'said', 'hate', 'most', 'things', 'understand', 'most', 'Hannibal', 'not', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'film', 'guess', 'fair', 'say', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'hate-worthy', 'film', 'make', 'boring']",N/A

After being introduced to Anthony Hopkins in the Hannibal series, fans now get an end cap with the origin of the character.  With WWII raging on in the background I found that there were some very plausible scenes with this film.It is sometimes hard to connect it with Hannibal of old, because I am so used to the other films like Silence of the Lambs as well as Red Dragon, which really captured a scary mood within the character of Hannibal.

1061256,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B000NVT0SE,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","This movie tries to explain why Hannibal Lecter turned out the way he did.  It tells the tale of a young Lecter, played by Gaspard Ulliel, who seeks revenge on soldiers that killed his family during World War II, and how what they did to his little sister specifically tuned him into a killer. We see the transformation from a scared kid, into what he ultimately becomes.  It has a strong supporting cast including Dominic West, Rhys Ifans (as the leader of the group of soldiers that kills his family) and Gong Li who plays his widowed Aunt and the person he tries to have a ""normal"" relationship with.  Even that relationship is far from normal.Obviously anyone playing the character is going to be measured against Anthony Hopkins' iconic portrayal.  I think Gaspard Ulliel did a good job with the character at this point in the story.  You can tell he tried to mirror some of what Hopkins did, but he also played him different than the adult version.  In my opinion it is not as good as Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal or even Red Dragon, but if you look at it as its own story and accept someone else in the role than it is enjoyable.As far as extras goes, there are a couple trailers, some deleted scenes a commentary track, and a 16 min making of featurette.

Hannibal needed time to develop the complex professorial character that made him so thrilling, and this is before it happened... this is the emergence of a tormented soul that will find solace in repeated and increasingly brutal sacrifices that he commits with his own hands and teeth. This is Hannibal Rising, so expect to see a gradual and straightforward progression into evil through a story that provides roots and justification to the monster that will eventually emerge. And emerge it eventually does, in all its blood-curling glory. Hannibal... ecstasy through redemptive monstrosity! Would you blame him? Maybe not, not anymore. Would you fear him?

Hannibal Rising is a prequel to everything else we've seen our favorite cannibal in, and upon viewing it you may wish you hadn't.  If you read Thomas Harris' Hannibal novel, then you'll probably remember the brief glimpse of backstory given to Hannibal Lecter's (Gaspard Ulliel) origin, of which this prequel capatilizes on.  As we witness the atrocities performed on Lecter and his family, we see the boy grow towards adulthood with revenge on his mind, and who can blame him really?  What kills Hannibal Rising is that Lecter isn't frightening at all throughout the film.  What helped make Silence of the Lambs so good, and to a degree Red Dragon (I wasn't fond of Ridley Scott's Hannibal at all) is that Lecter was a frightening, and brilliant, psychopath who became one of the most memorable screen villians of all time.  Here, he's relegated to a sympathetic state, and it doesn't work.  Not to mention that to say that Gaspard Ulliel doesn't fit the role is saying it lightly, and the rest of an otherwise solid cast (including Gong Li, Kevin McKidd, and Dominic West) are pretty much wasted in their roles.  Peter Webber's direction, while stylish, is ultimately empty, and a majority of the film plays out like an overlong slasher.  While there are a good amount of creepy moments and some solid, grisly effects, Hannibal Rising is a dud, and hopefully, the means to an end for a franchise that has been picked clean.",2,Means to an end,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,1506,"['franchises', 'should', 'just', 'know', 'when', 'time', 'hang', 'up', 'once', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'prequel', 'everything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'favorite', 'cannibal', 'viewing', 'may', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'Thomas', 'Harris', 'Hannibal', 'novel', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'remember', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'backstory', 'given', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Gaspard', 'Ulliel', 'origin', 'prequel', 'witness', 'atrocities', 'performed', 'Lecter', 'family', 'see', 'boy', 'grow', 'towards', 'adulthood', 'revenge', 'mind', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'really', 'What', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'Lecter', ""n't"", 'frightening', 'film', 'What', 'helped', 'make', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'so', 'good', 'degree', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'was', ""n't"", 'fond', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'was', 'frightening', 'brilliant', 'psychopath', 'who', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'screen', 'villians', 'time', 'Here', 'relegated', 'sympathetic', 'state', ""n't"", 'work', 'Not', 'mention', 'say', 'Gaspard', 'Ulliel', ""n't"", 'fit', 'role', 'saying', 'lightly', 'rest', 'otherwise', 'solid', 'cast', 'including', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'Dominic', 'West', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'wasted', 'roles', 'Peter', 'Webber', 'direction', 'stylish', 'ultimately', 'empty', 'majority', 'film', 'out', 'overlong', 'slasher', 'are', 'good', 'amount', 'creepy', 'moments', 'solid', 'grisly', 'effects', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'dud', 'hopefully', 'means', 'end', 'franchise', 'been', 'picked', 'clean']",N/A

It doesn't hold light to the Silence of the Lambs, but it's a good stand alone movie. They choose a good lead actor to play Hannibal. You feel like this is really him as a young adult.The story allows Hannibal to come back to life once again in a very disturbing way, and it gives you a nice back story that has him slowly becoming more psychopathic. It starts off during 1944, and continues eight years later. Some drastic events happen, which pushes the story in motion. While the story is really good, I don't like the woman at the second half of the movie due to her making some contradictory decisions.They picked the right character to portray the iconic image of Hannibal Lector. You really feel like this is what he would be like when he is a young man, and how these events later shaped him into the man we see in the latter movies. Also, you can tell the character starts enjoying what he is doing more and more, and that just makes it more twisted.Takes place during and post World War II; but has its own feel too it. What I mean is with so many World War II movies out there, this area of France is different than what has been filmed before. You get to see different season during the movie, and it is pulled off well. I believed it was winter when they showed the vast area with snow, along with summer and whatnot.The music adds to the movie, especially with that children's song that just becomes chilly when the movie goes along. Sound effects of the swords, cleavers, and gun fire sound loud and real. With this movie many different guns are being fired and each one has its only unique sound (like it obviously would in real life).This movie has some special features, but most of it is lackluster. Like so many movies with behind the scenes, they show so many scenes from the movie that doesn't need to be there. The only time you should have something like that is when you're showing either story boarding or CG stuff. Even with that, they only show the people sitting in a chair and talking about it, which most if not all of that information is told during the commentary. Commentary is insightful into how the movie was made (like most commentaries out their), and can be interesting at times. You can tell why they removed the deleted scenes, they're nothing spectacular.Overall I think you should pick this movie up if you enjoyed the other Hannibal movies. It gives you more insight to the mind of him, and how he became the person he is in those movies.~ Written: July, 2010Positives:* Nice starting point for Hannibal* Insight into Hannibal's mind* Unique and cool kills* Nice environments and setting* FreakyNegatives:* Deleted scenes kind of suck* Behind the scenes are same as the commentary* Sub-Character makes contradictory decisions during the movie",4,Hannible the cannible origins,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,2913,"['movie', 'finally', 'origins', 'Hannibal', 'Cannibal', 'pretty', 'twisted', 'movie', 'what', 'good', ""n't"", 'hold', 'light', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'good', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'choose', 'good', 'lead', 'actor', 'play', 'Hannibal', 'feel', 'really', 'young', 'adult.The', 'story', 'Hannibal', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'once', 'again', 'very', 'disturbing', 'way', 'nice', 'back', 'story', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'more', 'psychopathic', '1944', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'drastic', 'events', 'happen', 'story', 'motion', 'story', 'really', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'woman', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'due', 'making', 'contradictory', 'decisions.They', 'picked', 'right', 'character', 'portray', 'iconic', 'image', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'really', 'feel', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'how', 'events', 'later', 'shaped', 'man', 'see', 'latter', 'movies', 'Also', 'can', 'tell', 'character', 'enjoying', 'what', 'doing', 'more', 'more', 'just', 'more', 'twisted.Takes', 'place', 'post', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'own', 'feel', 'too', 'What', 'mean', 'so', 'many', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'movies', 'there', 'area', 'France', 'different', 'what', 'been', 'filmed', 'get', 'see', 'different', 'season', 'movie', 'pulled', 'off', 'well', 'believed', 'was', 'winter', 'when', 'showed', 'vast', 'area', 'snow', 'summer', 'whatnot.The', 'music', 'movie', 'especially', 'children', 'song', 'just', 'chilly', 'when', 'movie', 'along', 'Sound', 'effects', 'swords', 'cleavers', 'gun', 'fire', 'sound', 'loud', 'real', 'movie', 'many', 'different', 'guns', 'are', 'being', 'fired', 'one', 'only', 'unique', 'sound', 'obviously', 'would', 'real', 'life', '.This', 'movie', 'special', 'features', 'most', 'lackluster', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'scenes', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'movie', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'there', 'only', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'something', 'when', ""'re"", 'showing', 'story', 'boarding', 'CG', 'stuff', 'Even', 'only', 'show', 'people', 'sitting', 'chair', 'talking', 'most', 'not', 'information', 'told', 'commentary', 'Commentary', 'insightful', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'most', 'commentaries', 'out', 'can', 'be', 'interesting', 'times', 'can', 'tell', 'why', 'removed', 'deleted', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'nothing', 'spectacular.Overall', 'think', 'should', 'pick', 'movie', 'up', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'Hannibal', 'movies', 'more', 'insight', 'mind', 'how', 'became', 'person', 'movies.~', 'Written', 'July', '2010Positives', '*', 'Nice', 'starting', 'point', 'Hannibal*', 'Insight', 'Hannibal', 'mind*', 'Unique', 'cool', 'kills*', 'Nice', 'environments', 'setting*', 'FreakyNegatives', '*', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'kind', 'suck*', 'scenes', 'are', 'same', 'commentary*', 'Sub-Character', 'contradictory', 'decisions', 'movie']",N/A
1061271,A12FLZREV32JOP,B000NVT0SE,Noelle Eiram,"[4, 7]","It is best not to watch this film comparing this Hannibal to Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal. Expect a very bad movie and you may just enjoy it.Very young Hannibal Lecter watches his parents die during World War II. He and his baby sister, whom he fiercely protects, hide out in his wealthy family's lodge until a group of SS looters spot their lights. These men terrorize Hannibal and his little sister until they realize that they could all starve in this desolate winter. Then they eat her.Years later, Hannibal (now Gaspard Ulliel) attends a harsh boarding school set up on his old estate. It is evident that he is no longer a scared and distressed little boy. When a bully makes a move to strike him, Hannibal silently, swiftly, and expressionlessly stabs a fork through his aggressor's hand.Hannibal escapes the school to his uncle's gorgeous widow, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li). His aunt's wardrobe and manor are as beautiful as she. Basically, there a strange romance evolves between the two of them, despite his obsession with cannibalistic images and obvious delight in blood. Somehow Lady Murasaki doesn't seem to mind this, though she doesn't approve. (Are we supposed to believe it's because she is also scarred by losing her family in Hiroshima? Um. Okay.)Hannibal realizes that he must quiet the echoing screams of his dead sister by eating those who ate his sister. Again, okay. While working at medical school, our ""hero"" tracks these killers down and brutally disposes of them.Hannibal's position in the film is a funny one. He is almost heroic, in that he delivers just desserts to deserving specimen's of depravity. He even saves the damsel in distress and tells her that he loves her. On the other hand, he takes such obvious delight in sadistic murder and cannibalism, we are hardly meant to identify with him.It is difficult to believe that a single event, however traumatic, would turn someone into a psychopathic serial killer. Hannibal screams at night, but he is otherwise cold and merciless. He shows no hesitation whatsoever at his first bloody kill. Ulliel has a distinct but attractive face, and in spite of the horrible dialogue, manages to come across as rather creepy and beyond disturbed.Indeed, scattered throughout the long periods of silence is laughable dialogue. There are many unnecessary lines and moments in homage to later films. 'Hannibal Rising's conclusion is one of the worst I've seen because I didn't see it coming. I didn't realize that the climax was the climax.Acting is difficult to gauge, as the script is so limiting. However, the music and cinematography are gorgeous.I mildly enjoyed watching a budding serial killer wreak vengeance on awful people. If you love all things Hannibal, go for it. This is even for those who don't mind an almost intriguing drama with a bit of gore. Note that it is not exactly adrenaline pumping, though - it is rather slow and seems ultimately pointless. I doubt that 'Hannibal Rising' is for Hannibal purists. This Hannibal is quite different from the Hannibal we know. I simply accepted that Hannibal was much younger and therefore very unlike his later self. Whatever. It's a ridiculous but somewhat enjoyable film. Go see it if you want.

While Chilton fretted over figuring out what made Hannibal tick to broker a book deal, Starling was all too busy trying to solve a crime while becoming emotionally attached to a psychopath. The enigma of Hannibal Lector is what drove that detective story. The sequel `Hannibal' is a pure tale of horror with Hannibal on the loose in society. Within the framework of that story one tempting revelation came to pass... that Hannibal had been through a traumatic World War II experience involving his family and starvation. Nothing could have been more deliciously tempting. Let's face it by the end of `Hannibal' it was the single most mouth-watering eye-opener into the Hannibal diagnosis since we learned that his pulse did not go above 72 while chewing on a nurse.`Hannibal Rising' serves up the best dish yet. The whole movie is one big boiling frothing pot that feeds a Harris fan's ravenous need. For those who are interested, you will be licking the spoon and asking for more. Not only that but this movie is a whole new type of thriller. Who can accuse Harris of being uninspired and clich&eacute;d? The risk of `Hannibal' is worth the experience of `Rising' and then some more. Harris should be commended for rattling our brains and stomach with suggestive images of a boiling child's bath tub while relating it to the horrific incident that is slowly revealed throughout the frames.We get one most realistic depictions of a post-WWII France. Hannibal (a tremendously impressive Gaspard Ulliel), a young holocaust survivor of an all different type, has gaps in his memory and tries to remember the horrible thing that happened to him. Brought up and educated to higher than high standards, his only relation his Japanese aunt (Li Gong, a wonderful addition with Samaria swords and masks included!), the damaged child ferments between the cuts, encountering incidents that illuminate the darkness to reveal an evil so unsettling that drives him on to a type of shocking avenge operation for a motive that exposes you to a awfulness that you have never experienced before.

1061284,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B000NVT0SE,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[41, 58]","""Hannibal Rising"" gives us an account of the childhood through young adult years of Thomas Harris' notorious Dr. Hannibal Lecter. I won't synopsise the plot because several key events occur very early on in the movie - suffice it to say that the boy Lecter has his humanity removed by exposure to several inhuman characters, as well as the death of his family, during WWII Lithuania. Subsequently, the introverted and silent Lecter is taken in by his beautiful Japanese Aunt and, as the body count begins to multiply, Hannibal comes out of his shell and becomes more and more the character we remember from ""Silence of the Lambs"".This isn't a great movie. Mind you, it's not a bad one, either, not at all - Gong Li and Rhys Ifans give solid supporting performances to Gaspard Ulliel's confident, dynamic reading of Lecter, and Peter Webber's direction, while neither memorable nor original, is at least competent. Production design is duly lush, and the script is also reasonably sound. But the overall feeling you're left with at the end of the picture is that of Yet Another Blockbuster, and nothing at all like a study of the twisted psyche of a cannibalistic murderer.Possible Spolier Alert: Several of the elements of Hannibal's past are overblown and campy, not least the flashback scenes involving the Lithuanian militia and Lecter's sister Mischa. Far from a proposed sense of the inhuman, the bawdy antics of the group of soldiers recall Monty Python in a very undramatic way. There's nothing here we haven't seen before.Similarly, the heritage of Hannibal's Japanese Aunt feels slightly overconvenient and tacked-on, when, for his first murder, Lecter ""borrows"" the Samurai mask of her ancestors, providing a visual link to the most terrifying image of Hopkins' Lecter. But since that wasn't a choice on the part of the Hopkins character, why use it here? Like much of the film (the Lara Croft-style leather & motorcycle antics of Gong Li, samurai training montages in post-WW II France, exploding barges that belong in James Bond, and so forth), this image rings false, and Gaspard Ulliel's essentially sound portrayal of the young Hannibal Lecter is overdressed and dumbed-down because of this.On the other hand, if you haven't seen or read any of the other movies or novels in this series, this might be a good place to start: it's a lightweight, blockbustery sort of film, very flawed, but containing several decent elements of cast and production that save it from being a plain old bad movie.

But still, you have to ask yourself: how memorable was Hannibal Rising if I forgot about it while listing out the movies I'd seen this weekend to review, and not remembered to add it to that list for over an hour?Now, I'll admit that I'm judging this movie more harshly than I otherwise would because it's from the long-bleeding and damned-close-to-dead Hannibal franchise, but screenwriter Harris (adapting from his own novel) and director Webber (Girl with a Pearl Earring) really invite that sort of thing; there are little visual clues to the other movies littered throughout, including the infamous scene of a young Lecter (A Very Long Engagement's Gaspard Ulliel) trying on the bottom half of the samurai mask, which directly resembles the masked forced upon Anthony Hopkins in the Silence of the Lambs. Even that would be forgivable if the armor ever ended up being more than set decoration in this movie. But no-- it's there for the sole purpose of throwing the audience a biscuit. Really, what can you say to that?Divorced from the mythology, it would probably be a serviceable little thriller, a kind of I Spit on Your Grave-lite. Lecter and his family are living in Lithuania in 1944-- not a very nice place to be, as the Germans and the Russians are about to collide on their doorstep. Eight-year-old Hannibal, his younger sister Mischa, and his mother and father, along with some servants, retreat to the country house just before the Germans, with some SS-wannabe tagalongs headed by Grutas (Danny Deckchair's Rhys Ifans), get to Lecter Castle and start murdering the help. Through various chains of coincidence, the surviving Lecters and Grutas' band both end up barricaded in the country house, where bad things happen, and Hannibal vows revenge. Yeah, you've heard it all a million times before. And it works, kind of, in the sense that you know what's coming within a few minutes of the opening (really, if you've seen the rest of the movies in the canon, you knew what was coming from the moment you first heard this movie was in production). In that respect, it's analogous to any of the Friday the 13th or Halloween sequels; you're looking forward to the next inventive death, rather than worrying about such details as plot, characterization, etc. All of which do exist here as a kind of thin veneer, so at least it ranks above any Friday the 13th after the second one.One high point n the movie bears mentioning, though.

1061296,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000NVT0SE,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","*SPOILERS*So just how does one go from being a carefree, apple-cheeked schoolboy to becoming the most notorious, cannibalistic serial killer in literary history?  ""Hannibal Rising"" thinks it has the answer.  First, you watch as Nazis mow down your parents in cold blood.  Then, you look on helplessly as a band of starving Lithuanian soldiers carve up and eat your little sister.  Finally, you enroll in med school so you will not only acquire intimate knowledge of the human anatomy but will have unlimited access to disemboweled cadavers and tools of dismemberment that will come in mighty handy in your off-duty hours.The very concept of Hannibal Lecter is so off-putting and distasteful (pardon the pun) that it really only works when you have an actor of the caliber of Anthony Hopkins on hand to, in some way at least, ""humanize"" the character.  For without the ""charisma"" Hopkins brought to the role, Lecter becomes just another garden-variety psycho - and the movies themselves mere exercises in cheap, tawdry exploitation.This is the single greatest problem with this alleged ""prequel"" to the Academy Award-winning ""Silence of the Lambs.""  Hard as it tries, it really can't make Lecter's transformation all that compelling or believable.  And without that shield to protect us, the goriness and unpleasantness come rushing over us with full, unabated force.  Admittedly, there`s a certain purgative kick in watching the cannibals get their comeuppance at the hand of one of their victims, but you`ll still probably feel like taking a shower after the movie.  About the only interesting aspect to the story is how each of the three main characters has chosen a different way to cope with the loss of family members in the war:  Lecter (Gaspard Ulliel), of course, turns to revenge murders and cannibalism; the chief inspector (Dominic West) goes after unpunished war criminals; and Lecter's beautiful Japanese aunt (Li Gong) helps protect her nephew from the full force of the law.  But such analysis is going way too far in justifying a movie whose sole purpose for existing is to turn the audience's stomach as it caters to the propensity for vicarious sadism that resides in the human species.Those who made ""Hannibal Rising"" have taken a character who was terrifying precisely because his actions COULDN'T be explained in any rational manner - and thus any one of us could fall victim to his madness - and have turned him into a conventional Angel of Vengeance stamping out evildoers and injustice, with the imprimatur of ""divine righteousness"" to give him moral cover.  In short, they have transmogrified him into little more than a comic book action figure (albeit an extremely dark one).  Not that it`s any big deal in the grand scheme of things, but ""Hannibal Rising"" might be more accurately entitled ""Hannibal Falling.""",2,Hannibal Lecter as comic book avenger,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,2837,"['*SPOILERS*So', 'just', 'how', 'one', 'go', 'being', 'carefree', 'apple-cheeked', 'schoolboy', 'becoming', 'most', 'notorious', 'cannibalistic', 'serial', 'killer', 'literary', 'history', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'answer', 'First', 'watch', 'Nazis', 'mow', 'down', 'parents', 'cold', 'blood', 'Then', 'look', 'helplessly', 'band', 'starving', 'Lithuanian', 'soldiers', 'carve', 'up', 'eat', 'little', 'sister', 'Finally', 'enroll', 'med', 'school', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'acquire', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'human', 'anatomy', 'will', 'have', 'unlimited', 'access', 'disemboweled', 'cadavers', 'tools', 'dismemberment', 'will', 'come', 'mighty', 'handy', 'off-duty', 'hours.The', 'very', 'concept', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'so', 'off-putting', 'distasteful', 'pardon', 'pun', 'really', 'only', 'when', 'have', 'actor', 'caliber', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'hand', 'way', 'least', 'humanize', 'character', 'charisma', 'brought', 'role', 'Lecter', 'just', 'garden-variety', 'psycho', 'movies', 'mere', 'exercises', 'cheap', 'tawdry', 'exploitation.This', 'single', 'greatest', 'problem', 'alleged', 'prequel', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Hard', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'Lecter', 'transformation', 'compelling', 'believable', 'shield', 'protect', 'goriness', 'unpleasantness', 'come', 'rushing', 'full', 'unabated', 'force', 'Admittedly', 's', 'certain', 'purgative', 'kick', 'watching', 'cannibals', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'hand', 'one', 'victims', 'll', 'still', 'probably', 'feel', 'taking', 'shower', 'movie', 'only', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'story', 'how', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'chosen', 'different', 'way', 'cope', 'loss', 'family', 'members', 'war', 'Lecter', 'Gaspard', 'Ulliel', 'course', 'revenge', 'murders', 'cannibalism', 'chief', 'inspector', 'Dominic', 'West', 'unpunished', 'war', 'criminals', 'Lecter', 'beautiful', 'Japanese', 'aunt', 'Li', 'Gong', 'protect', 'nephew', 'full', 'force', 'law', 'such', 'analysis', 'going', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'justifying', 'movie', 'sole', 'purpose', 'existing', 'turn', 'audience', 'stomach', 'propensity', 'vicarious', 'sadism', 'human', 'species.Those', 'who', 'made', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'have', 'taken', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'terrifying', 'precisely', 'actions', 'COULD', ""N'T"", 'be', 'explained', 'rational', 'manner', 'thus', 'one', 'could', 'fall', 'victim', 'madness', 'have', 'turned', 'conventional', 'Angel', 'Vengeance', 'stamping', 'out', 'evildoers', 'injustice', 'imprimatur', 'divine', 'righteousness', 'give', 'moral', 'cover', 'short', 'have', 'transmogrified', 'little', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'action', 'figure', 'extremely', 'dark', 'one', 'Not', 's', 'big', 'deal', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'accurately', 'entitled', 'Hannibal', 'Falling']",N/A

But don't listen to me and never start watching a movie with a preconceived notion that it will be a good film.I am a fan of Thomas Harris, the author of Silence of the Lambs and all of the Hannibal works. If you have read his books, you will understand what I am about to say. I feel sorry for Hannibal; I sympathize for him. My feelings, however, did not begin with this film (I have not read the book), but with Hannibal, the previous book. The previous work briefly touched on his history and that his sister was eaten on the Eastern Front during World War II. Note that I preferred the book over the butchered (no pun intended) story that arrived onscreen. As a natural course, Hannibal Rising visits that dark place in Hannibal's life and emerges us, the audience, in his ordeal.For Hannibal fans, everything comes full circle. Now we know how and why. I see this film as an inspiring art form. The total vision, from story, production, to acting, is unique and fresh, in a dark way. It also helps greatly that Thomas Harris wrote the screenplay.

Why feel the need to explain Hannibal - isn't he 10,000 times more fun when he's an inexplicable sociopath?  People may think my review is unfair because I'm comparing the movie to those previously made, but one cannot judge this as a stand-alone movie!  If pre-quels or sequels do not have anything to add or don't come close to the expectations previously set, why even make them??The movie starts out with the Lecter family living a bucolic life in their huge Luthuanian castle during WWII.  The family gets caught in the middle of a battle, and everyone is killed except Hannibal and his little sister, Mischa, who are taken captive by stranded soldiers.  The following events explain why Hannibal develops a predilection for consuming human flesh.  He spends the rest of the movie galavanting around Europe to track down the men who killed his sister, and murdering them.A very serious storyline, but parts of the movie were so ridiculous, they were laugh-out-loud funny.  Hannibal's attraction to his random Japanese aunt, his ability to easily travel throughout post-war Europe when the police know he is a murderer, the speed in which he tracks down the soldiers who killed his sister, the mask from the samurai warrior ""foreshadowing"" the mask from Silence of the Lambs, and many other visual images that are just bizarre...The sad part about the whole movie is that it completely destroys the mystique that Harris has built around Lecter.  In previous books/movies, Hannibal is refined, thoughtful, witty and a true gentleman (albeit in a backwards manner).  This Hannibal is a savage animal solely driven by vengeance.  The Silence of the Lambs Hannibal wouldn't waste his brain cells thinking about his counterpart in Hannibal Rising because he is so base and un-interesting.  Plus, this storyline gives the viewer a reason to feel bad for Hannibal and gives him an excuse for his behavior.

So I was kind of hyped to see ""Rising"" and dashed out to see one of the first shows. I guess I hyped myself up alittle too much. What I was expecting to see was a tale of Hannibal developing his psychosis and later having it overcome and posses him. What I got instead was a revenge story that has been done to death in many a previous movie. It seemed almost cookie-cutter in it's delievery. The story starts off with a young Hannibal who flees his affluent house in Lithuania from the advancing Nazi army. Hannibals parents are killed leaving Hannibal to take care of his little sister. The two are held up in a little house in the forest in the dead of winter. The house is discovered by some nasty Nazis and soon the food runs out. This is where Hannibal is introduced to cannibalism and the tragic loss of his sister. The rest of the movie is very predictable. Hannibal grows up, is haunted by nightmares, finds out who the nazis are and exacts revenge. That's the movie. The silliest part is when Hannibal meets his uncle's wife and finds that she has a Samurai shrine in her basement. The rest of the movie Hannibal walks around sporting a Katana like a ronin wana be. What bothered me most is that they made Hannibal out as an anti-hero. He was a wronged victim running about wielding a Samurai sword killing big bad Nazis like a super hero. The film wanted you to like him. The image of Hannibal as a frightening Phychopathic killer never made an apprearance and was some what distroyed in the film.

1061311,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B000NVT0SE,Sky,"[6, 7]","Hannibal Rising suffered severely at the box office because it was implied in the trailers that we'd mainly see a young Hannibal Lecter slashing up the countryside. That kind of marketing certainly didn't lure me into theaters to see it, and--based on its less than $30 million box office gross--much of the public had the same sentiment.At the end of May, Hannibal Rising gets released on DVD and the memory of the slash-'em-up trailer is still in my head, so I'm not compelled to see it, but 4 weeks later I finally do. And it turns out to be one of the better movies that I've seen this year.Funny though...I'm not sure that I'd have appreciated Hannibal Rising as much without first seeing 1991's Silence of the LambsThe Silence of the Lambs (Two-Disc Collector's Edition). Oh, it certainly isn't necessary to see Silence of the Lambs prior to seeing Hannibal Rising. Ironically, seeing Lambs before seeing this prequel just puts a better perspective on the things to come as you watch Lecter in his early years. It did for me anyway.In Silence of the Lambs you fear Lecter and what he'll do next. In Hannibal Rising you actually find yourself rooting for him with a kind of sympathy. Hannibal Rising is more a story of revenge than it is a story about a serial killer...kind of like a RamboFirst Blood (Special Edition)with class.In Hannibal Rising, you get a great directorial from little known Peter Webber and a terrific performance out of mostly French film actor Gaspard Ulliel. In the beginning sequence Webber went a little overboard with getting us to believe that those who committed the atrocities that ultimately turned Lecter into what he bacame would all be so unified in the decision to commit the atrocities. But the movie really is done well overall and Ulliel played a masterfully diabolical young Hannibal Lecter.So forget that the movie poster and DVD cover have a picture of Lecter in what looks like that this'll-prevent-you-from-bitng-me mask (turns out that's not what it is at all). And forget that the trailers showed mainly a young, sinister looking Hannibal Lecter as if about to cut someone open. Hannibal Rising ultimately is less gory than you probably think it will be, and less gory than 2001's HannibalHannibal. It's not a Horror movie. It's just a very good movie like 1986's ManhunterManhunter (Restored Director's Cut Divimax Edition)and/or its 2002 remake Red DragonRed Dragon - Collector's Edition (Widescreen).I wouldn't go so far as to say that Hannibal Rising is a classic, as Silence of the Lambs was, but it's very good. Fans of Lambs should take a chance with Hannibal Rising.The missing story in the Lecter chronicles is his doings in the US leading up to his capture by FBI Agent Will Graham (between Hannibal Rising and Red Dragon).

And this time it's been done with a prequel that goes all the way back to Hannibal's childhood, a story that I - and probably quite a few other fans - wasn't sure was a good idea to tell.  Didn't the excellent ""Red Dragon"" reveal enough of Lecter's backstory?  Was going back further going to do anything other than take away the air of mystery to the character?Fortunately, ""Hannibal Rising"" only deepens the impact of the character and his previous films.  Beginning in World War II Lithuania, we see the deaths of young Lecter's family, not at the hands of Hannibal  himself, but by Nazis and a band of marauding Lithuanian ex-Nazi collaborators/turned 'freelance' looters and terrorizers.  Through a ghastly set of circumstances best left to be seen in the movie itself, the surviving Hannibal is found by the Russian forces moving in at the end of the war, a mute child wandering through the woods with a chain around his neck.  Raised in a Soviet orphanage, the amnesiac and still-mute Hannibal seemingly develops into an unlikely defender of the oppressed  (""You go against the way of nature, Hannibal"", an orphanage official tells him, ""Always hurting the bully""), Lecter eventually frees himself and makes his way across Europe to the residence of some disrant relatives, where the bulk of the movie takes place.  The older but still mute Hannibal (played by Gaspard Ulliel in the male breakout performance of the year so far) is cared for by the widow (Gong Li, another great performance in a highly well-acted movie) of his deceased uncle, later becoming more deeply involved with her.It's upon regaining his memory of the events in the war that the transformation really begins.  The bloody path of Hannibal Lecter as we know him begins as revenge, but as we already know from the previous movies, it doesn't end there.  Hannibal ends up travelling from innocent child to a dark, violent avenger, to what he is when ""Red Dragon"" takes place (although ""Hannibal Rising"" wraps up many years before Dragon commences - maybe we haven't seen the last of the pre-Anthony Hopkins Hannibal).  As the end of Hannibal Rising nears, it enters extreme territory that makes the legendary 'banquet' scene from 2001's ""Hannibal"" look like a tranquil countryside brunch.*WARNING - POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD*In ways, we see Hannibal Lecter die twice in this movie.  The first is in the World War II Lithuanian winter, where the little boy effectively ceases to be, and begins the path to his new incarnation as a passion-driven dark avenger.  The second death though, the passing from avenger to psychopath, could be considered to be a metaphorical suicide (as opposed to the way his days as a happy child were 'murdered' when his family's lives were taken).  What drives Lecter to this point - and the violence with which this path begins: the death of one of the last surviving members of his family's killers, in a fashion so savage and shocking it outdoes anything in the previous three Lecter movies; makes his dispatching of previous guilty parties seem tame; and is enough to floor even the seasoned horror fan - is the kind of thing to stay with one, to haunt you long after the movie is over.  And with it the evil, fully-formed Hannibal Lecter, is truly risen.  Great stuff, managing to be on par with Anthony Hopkins's Lecter movies.",5,Truly Shocking And Extremely Well-Made Origin Tale For Dr. Lecter,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,3476,"['new', 'entry', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'story', 'appreciation', 'series', 'whole', 'previous', 'chapter', 'time', 'been', 'done', 'prequel', 'way', 'back', 'Hannibal', 'childhood', 'story', 'probably', 'quite', 'few', 'other', 'fans', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'tell', 'Did', ""n't"", 'excellent', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'reveal', 'Lecter', 'backstory', 'Was', 'going', 'back', 'further', 'going', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'take', 'away', 'air', 'mystery', 'character', 'Fortunately', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'only', 'impact', 'character', 'previous', 'films', 'Beginning', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Lithuania', 'see', 'deaths', 'young', 'Lecter', 'family', 'not', 'hands', 'Hannibal', 'Nazis', 'band', 'marauding', 'Lithuanian', 'ex-Nazi', 'collaborators/turned', ""'freelance"", 'looters', 'terrorizers', 'ghastly', 'set', 'circumstances', 'best', 'left', 'be', 'seen', 'movie', 'surviving', 'Hannibal', 'found', 'Russian', 'forces', 'moving', 'end', 'war', 'mute', 'child', 'wandering', 'woods', 'chain', 'neck', 'Raised', 'Soviet', 'orphanage', 'amnesiac', 'still-mute', 'Hannibal', 'seemingly', 'unlikely', 'defender', 'oppressed', 'go', 'way', 'nature', 'Hannibal', 'orphanage', 'official', 'Always', 'hurting', 'bully', 'Lecter', 'eventually', 'way', 'Europe', 'residence', 'disrant', 'relatives', 'where', 'bulk', 'movie', 'place', 'older', 'still', 'mute', 'Hannibal', 'played', 'Gaspard', 'Ulliel', 'male', 'performance', 'year', 'so', 'far', 'cared', 'widow', 'Gong', 'Li', 'great', 'performance', 'highly', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'deceased', 'uncle', 'later', 'becoming', 'more', 'deeply', 'involved', 'her.It', 'regaining', 'memory', 'events', 'war', 'transformation', 'really', 'bloody', 'path', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'know', 'revenge', 'already', 'know', 'previous', 'movies', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'Hannibal', 'up', 'travelling', 'innocent', 'child', 'dark', 'violent', 'avenger', 'what', 'when', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'place', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'wraps', 'up', 'many', 'years', 'Dragon', 'commences', 'maybe', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'last', 'pre-Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Hannibal', 'end', 'Hannibal', 'Rising', 'nears', 'extreme', 'territory', 'legendary', 'scene', '2001', 'Hannibal', 'look', 'tranquil', 'countryside', 'brunch', '*WARNING', 'POSSIBLE', 'SEMI-SPOILERS', 'AHEAD*In', 'ways', 'see', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'die', 'twice', 'movie', 'first', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Lithuanian', 'winter', 'where', 'little', 'boy', 'effectively', 'be', 'path', 'new', 'incarnation', 'passion-driven', 'dark', 'avenger', 'second', 'death', 'passing', 'avenger', 'psychopath', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'metaphorical', 'suicide', 'opposed', 'way', 'days', 'happy', 'child', 'were', ""'murdered"", 'when', 'family', 'lives', 'were', 'taken', 'What', 'Lecter', 'point', 'violence', 'path', 'death', 'one', 'last', 'surviving', 'members', 'family', 'killers', 'fashion', 'so', 'savage', 'shocking', 'anything', 'previous', 'three', 'Lecter', 'movies', 'dispatching', 'previous', 'guilty', 'parties', 'seem', 'tame', 'enough', 'floor', 'even', 'seasoned', 'horror', 'fan', 'kind', 'thing', 'stay', 'one', 'haunt', 'long', 'movie', 'evil', 'fully-formed', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'truly', 'risen', 'Great', 'stuff', 'managing', 'be', 'par', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Lecter', 'movies']",N/A

I thought ""Silence of the Lambs"" was a good, scary book, and the film was ""tastefully"" done, given the material.The original ""Manhunter"" I thought was almost laughable, but ""Red Dragon,"" on which it is based was another scary book, and the film of the same title was exciting and worth seeing.The book ""Hannibal"" was Harris busy trying to outdo himself. Too busy. And the film was nominal at best.Now, the good things about ""Hannibal Rising"": The set was fabulous. The music was appropriate to a morbid murder story. But, to summarize my distaste for it, first, it was sometimes hard to understand what the characters were saying. (Dominic West, by the way, does a great American accent, like in ""The Wire."" I wasn't impressed with his French accent.)But worst of all--and this is unforgiveable, and the reason I describe it as ""like a cartoon""--too many things happened like they only could in essentially a kids' story. For example, Hannibal's antagonists catch him, they're just about to kill him (I won't say how, and give anything away) just as the fire starts and his death is prevented. In the nick of time. Another two seconds and he'd have been dead.Next, and even worse, Hannibal is on board the ""houseboat"" in the canal, breaks into the cabin in which his aunt/lover is being held. Her captor shoots him. He falls, only to rise a few minutes later. It seems--wow, such a perfect shot!--the bullet hit the sword that he'd been taught to use early in the script.

The over-the-top plot events, such as his sister getting eaten, living with an aristocratic Japanese woman who is also a martial arts expert, lots of ridiculously difficult feats requiring nearly superhuman skill, etc, give it a very comic book-ish feel. It has an atmosphere sort of like the superhero movies that have come out lately, and sort of like a less stylised Sin City. It certainly has little, if any, resemblance to the other films in the Hannibal series. The events and characters are very inventive, the ""coolness"" factor permeates everything (eg: he goes to medical school, and is also secretly a martial arts expert and murderer... how cool is that?), and it's generally a neat movie. Hannibal's character tends to come across as a superhero turned supervillian, a la comic book, and the character development is very convincing. When I saw this movie in the theater, it definitely seemed to arouse in the audience a sense of excitement and energetic anticipation, as most movies that start out really well do.However, that anticipation was greatly disappointed by the last third or so of the movie. At that point everything happens exactly as you'd expect. The audience is already expected to know that Hannibal becomes a sociopathic cannibalistic murderer, so I won't be spoiling much when I say that the third half is just Hannibal killing people. He goes, he kills the people he's expected to kill, and that's it. The inventiveness of the first part of the movie disappears and everything just sort of happens in the most unimaginative way possible.

This applies 100% to ""Hannibal Rising"", a film that is completely unnecessary to the Hannibal cannon and should never have been made.For a basic plot summary, ""Hannibal Rising"" tells the story of young man Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel) who comes into his psychotic personality after a terrifying experience involving his young sister & cannibalism.  After becoming an orphan and moving in with his aunt Lady Murasaki (Li Gong), Hannibal vows to find his sister's tormentors and inflict grisly punishment on them.Besides all the other laughable stuff (for example, the young Hannibal putting on a barred mask) in this film, the glaring weakness is easy to identify: Hannibal Lecter was scary because he couldn't be understood.  As human beings, it is difficult for us to understand the mentality behind a cannibal, and that is why Anthony Hopkins' Lecter was so creepy.  Trying to explain Lecter's flesh-hungers is not only probably impossible, but also just plain dumb.  There needed to be some endgame thoughts before even pitching this movie, such as ""what purpose will it serve?"" or ""does this story really need to be told?"".It doesn't help that the acting is nothing special and there is no psychological tension whatsoever.  Pretty much just emotionally flat all the way through.Overall, then, I consider ""Hannibal Rising"" to be one of the most ill-conceived movies of all-time.  It didn't need to be made, and then even when it was it was made very poorly (likely in order to try and attract a younger audience to the Hannibal franchise).
