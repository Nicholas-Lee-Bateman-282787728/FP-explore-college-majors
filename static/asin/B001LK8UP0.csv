1214525,A1248JRIINWRTH,B001LK8UP0,"Angela Wilson ""I love books & DVDs!""","[0, 1]","Filled with cliches and self-importance, this 98-minute plodding film is nothing more than the Puerto Rican version ofThe Family Stone (Widescreen Edition).In Nothing Like the Holidays, the children of Puerto Rican parents descend on their hometown to celebrate the holidays. Each has their own set of problems. The couple played by Debra Messing and John Leguizamo argue about having kids while she harbors a secret from her temperamental husband. Freddy Rodriguez plays the prodigal son, coming home from a tour in Iraq with demons from the battlefield. An odd assortment of other brothers and a sister who is trying hard to make it big in Hollywood make up the rest of the cast.The formula used was so similar I could have been watching The Family Stone with different actors. The only major difference is that this film features a Puerto Rican family instead. I know this formula as been used previously, but offhand I cannot think of other titles.The acting is the only thing that saves this cliched film. Unfortunately, the characters are so stereotypical, it shouldn't take much talent to play them. Sometimes, they seemed two-dimensional simply because they were so obvious.Nothing Like the Holidays is not a comedy, yet not quite a drama. It is a plodding, wasted use of cinematic space.

1214527,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001LK8UP0,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Nothing Like the Holidays is, to sum it up, a severely bland film without any interesting storyline to speak of.  I gave it a lot of time to develop into *something* but it never really happens.  Instead the movies drawing point seems to be gathering a few big name actors and putting them together without any regard for storyline development to take place.I've seem a bunch of movies attempt the same thing, and in fact, I'm now convinced that whenever a film has too many popular actors and actresses at once, you should be worried about the quality of the content.No, this isn't supposed to be a comedy- it's entirely a drama, and a very boring one at that.  The only segment that even caught my interest is when the mother and father were sitting at the dinner table with their huge family and the mother revealed a huge surprise that was initially taken as a joke, but quickly turns into a serious situation.  This was the only time the movie was interesting for me.As for this being a ""timeless Christmas movie for the entire family""... nah.  I wouldn't even call it a Christmas movie, let alone one that the entire family should watch because the entire family will probably be bored senseless.What it comes down to is this- WAY too much time is devoted to this family doing absolutely nothing, saying nothing interesting, and just hanging around enjoying being a family together in a Chicago home.  That's all fine and good, but for those of us watching the movie, it doesn't make for interesting storytelling so it feels like an overrated film to me.

O'DELL ""njsquarebear""","[3, 3]","I really wanted to love this move... and while I think it has a great cast of Latinos/as, it just seemed like a drama one would find on tv.  The script just wasn't all that great... and except for the music and the one scene where the neighborhood residents parade through the streets singing a latin-tinged holiday carol, it struck me that this movie wasn't all that latin in flavor.  It just seemed to be a script which could have easily been cast with all African-Ameicans (perhaps because it was produced by the same folks who did 'Barbershop 1+2'?), or Asians or White folk!  The script is not particularly Christmas-y either, it is basically a family 'dining room table' drama set against holidays... and that's been so repeated so much, that it really isn't very interesying.  I'm not saying that I won't watch the move each year (I will), or that I hated the move (I don't), but just that it isn't up there in classic Christmas movies that future generations will want to see?

While this made the film richer, it perhaps shortchanges the viewers of this short (98 minutes)film. With so many characters and storylines, and so little time, I found myself wanting to know more about each of them (was Ozzie in a gang?, was the Dad really a lothario?). This film would have been a good pilot for an hour long tv series. Nevertheless, I found it enjoyable and captivating, wanting to know how each of the characters stories would turn out (I'm writing this very generally to avoid multiple spoilers).As I was watching this, I completely forgot it was a ""holiday"" film. Although the film takes place at Christmas time, and this is used as a plot mechanism to explain the gathering of all the family members from around the globe, with the exception of a few scenes (opening presents, singing carols), Christmas isn't essential to make this film work- it's the family, the characters, and their stories.I recommend watching this film any time of year, not just around the holidays.",4,Not what I expected- better than I expected; not just for holidays!,1256083200,"10 21, 2009",2009,1323,"['was', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'typical', 'wacky', 'Home', 'Holidays', '/', 'Four', 'Christmases', 'kind', 'holiday', 'film', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'twist.Boy', 'was', 'surprised', 'many', 'humorus', 'moments', 'Nothing', 'Holidays', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'many', 'dramatic', 'subplots', 'intertwined', 'film', 'made', 'film', 'richer', 'perhaps', 'viewers', 'short', '98', 'minutes', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'storylines', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'found', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'was', 'Ozzie', 'gang', 'was', 'Dad', 'really', 'lothario', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'pilot', 'hour', 'long', 'tv', 'series', 'Nevertheless', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'captivating', 'wanting', 'know', 'how', 'characters', 'stories', 'would', 'turn', 'out', ""'m"", 'writing', 'very', 'generally', 'avoid', 'multiple', 'spoilers', '.As', 'was', 'watching', 'completely', 'forgot', 'was', 'holiday', 'film', 'film', 'place', 'Christmas', 'time', 'used', 'plot', 'mechanism', 'explain', 'gathering', 'family', 'members', 'globe', 'exception', 'few', 'scenes', 'opening', 'presents', 'singing', 'carols', 'Christmas', ""n't"", 'essential', 'make', 'film', 'work-', 'family', 'characters', 'stories.I', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'time', 'year', 'not', 'just', 'holidays']",Nothing Like the Holidays
1214531,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B001LK8UP0,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[1, 1]","Holidays will always provide for good reasons to make movies - not only because of their entertainment values, but also because the say a lot about our culture and our times. Because most films about Christmas, Thanksgiving and other special occasions are mostly about white and black families, the wonderful ""Nothing like the Holidays"" fits in perfectly: its story is about a Puerto Rican family, a rarity that was missing from the big screen.""Nothing like the Holidays"" has plenty of drama and laughs, for sure. It centers on the Rodriguez family, headed by Edy (Alfred Molina), the father, and Anna (Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a), the mother. It begins with the arrival of son Jesse (Freddy Rodriguez) from Iraq. He was eagerly awaited by his friends Johnny (Luis Guzm&aacute;n), who provides most of the humor in the film, and Ozzy (Jay Hern&aacute;ndez). He would later be joined by his parents, as well as his brother Mauricio (John Leguizamo) and sister Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito). In addition, there is also Sarah (Debra Messing), Mauricio's wife. All of them will celebrate Christmas together. Everything is going well, that is, until Anna drops a bomb that takes everybody by surprise and will determine the success or failure of the family reunion.""Nothing like the Holidays"" feels like we have been there before in many ways, because almost all holidays movies have a dose of last-minute problems that bring negativity to the festivities. However, as I said before, the movie succeeds in bringing the joys and sorrows of a Puerto Rican family to the screen, and shows another side of the so-called American dream. We see the Bodegas, the aguinaldos, the food, and also hear good salsa music. Messing is really good as the Anglo outsider, who tries to blend with a different culture than her own. It's all there to enjoy. The DVD includes audio commentary by Freddy Rodriguez, who also co-produced, director Alfredo De Villa, and producer Robert Teitel; making-of feature; bloopers, and more.

1214532,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001LK8UP0,Chris Pandolfi,"[25, 31]","Allow me to quote from my review of ""Four Christmases,"" released only a few weeks ago: ""I don't need to spend $8.75 to be told that we should spend time with our loved ones, even if they're completely insane. By now, I think we all know."" As much as I believe this to be true, films like ""Nothing Like the Holidays"" prove that even well established messages can still be effective. This movie is everything ""Four Christmases"" was not: funny, touching, and intelligent, with drama that actually feels genuine. While it gives us just about everything we've come to expect from the typical holiday movie, it makes the most of what it's got, and I have a feeling that just about everyone will find it relatable to certain degree. It's a family drama that has just the right balance of humor and heart, and it features a number of actors that naturally fit into the material.""Nothing Like the Holidays"" tells the story of the Rodriguez family and the drama that befalls them during the Christmas holiday. The father, Edy (Alfred Molina), is the owner of a Puerto Rican grocery store in the middle of Chicago, and he'd like nothing more than for one of his sons to someday take over the business. Unfortunately, he and his wife, Anna (Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a), are having a great deal of problems. Anna is a very unhappy woman. For one thing, she has reason to believe that Edy is cheating on her, with his constant cell phone calls and late nights out. Furthermore, she would like nothing more than for her son, Mauricio (John Leguizamo), and his wife, Sarah (Debra Messing), to bless her elderly years with a grandchild. When in the same room together, Anna regards Sarah not with scorn, but with a quiet air of disappointment, as if to say she could be doing a much better job.Sarah and Mauricio are having problems of their own. While they're successful executives in New York City, business opportunities are threatening both their marriage and their prospects for having children, which Sarah may not be ready for right now. It would help if Anna would stop asking for a grandchild. She's trying her hardest to be on friendly terms with Anna, offering to help clean, practicing Spanish, insisting that she's learned a great deal about Puerto Rican cuisine. There's a wonderful moment just after Anna announces at the dinner table that she's divorcing Edy; after everyone leaves in disgust, Sarah remains where she is, calmly asserting that she isn't finished eating. For the first time, Anna gives Sarah a genuinely loving look.Unfortunately, Mauricio is unwilling to accept his parents' divorce, probably because, as a married man himself, he believes that spouses are supposed to ride the ups and downs of life together. Ultimately, he says, you end up falling in love all over again. What he seems to be forgetting is that his mother suspects his father of cheating, which is unforgivable after over thirty years of marriage.And then there are the other two children. The younger son, Jesse (Freddy Rodriguez, also one of the film's executive producers), is a soldier returning home from the Iraq war. He carries a lot of guilt, not only because he broke up with his girlfriend, Marissa (Melonie Diaz), but also because of an event that went horribly wrong in Iraq. Now back home, Edy is putting pressure on Jesse to take control of the grocery store. But does Jesse want that kind of responsibility? What exactly does he want? Whatever it is, he doesn't believe he'll find it in the Humboldt Park area of Chicago. He certainly won't be getting any support from Mauricio, who has always felt that Jesse had virtually everything handed to him.The sister, Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito), is an actress visiting from Los Angeles. While she has managed a few small roles, she has yet to get her big break. She is being considered for a part in a new television series, but given the fact that her agent calls frequently with little to no news, it's difficult to say what will happen. What she really doesn't understand is why everyone around her thinks she has been living such a glamorous life; they seem to forget that many actors struggle to pay their bills.Intertwined with all this are a couple of minor subplots, including the Rodriguez's outspoken cousin, Johnny (Luis Guzm&aacute;n), Marissa's relationship with a new man, and Roxanna's friend, Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), a former gang member who still has some unfinished business. There are also a few interesting scenes with a tree that's been standing on the Rodriguez's front lawn for years. Anna has always wanted it cut down; it doesn't give her a view. Attempts to destroy it only make its metaphor for family all the more obvious--it may by twisted, obstructive, and just plain ugly, but it's also indestructible and deeply rooted. Messages like this are expected in holiday movies, and I can't fool myself into believing that ""Nothing Like the Holidays"" gives us anything new in the way of family drama. But I also can't deny the fact that the filmmakers made it work. This movie, for all intents and purposes, feels authentic from beginning to end. It's funny at times, yet it never goes for a series of cheap laughs. It's sad at times, yet it doesn't resort to overblown moments of melodrama. It gave me the gift of an enjoyable movie going experience, and I'm sure it will do the same for you.",4,We're Spending Christmas Together Whether You Like it or Not,1229212800,"12 14,

It's a joy to watch the stellar cast create such a believable family of characters that every scene feels right and true... especially since some of the challenges being faced aren't neatly resolved in every case.More of a drama than a laugh-a-minute comedy, this ensemble film hits the right chord when dealing with the ways some family members are treated differently than others, as well as the way some families seem like they're arguing every time they talk.

1214539,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B001LK8UP0,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[3, 4]","This warm, often amusing, holiday film can be described as the Puerto Rican version ofHome for the Holidays, set at Christmas rather than Thanksgiving, but still with a dysfunctional family, each member with his/her own drama, at its heart.  Jessie, an Iraqi War veteran, returns home to for the holidays, wounded both physically and mentally.  His sister Roxanna, the one everyone calls their Hollywood star, plays her family role despite the undercurrents of hidden failure.  Brother Mauricio and his Jewish wife Sarah, who tries gamely to embrace the culture, have their own issues. The family is presided over by father Edy and mother Anna, a couple obviously in love but unwilling to confront their unhappiness until Anna does so, dramatically, at the dinner table.  Add a cast of extended relatives, lost loves, and a potentially deadly confrontation, and you have this boisterous family drama where you cannot help rooting for the happiness and safety of everyone involved.  The cultural details arise naturally out of the setting and plot, and they make this film memorable, more than just another holiday movie about people who want to be happy.Alfred Molina as Edy is quietly effective; I couldn't help liking him despite his character's occasional idiocy, and Elizabeth Pena as his wife Anna is even better.  Debra Messing's Sarah is upright and staid, awkward at first until she wins the trust of her in-laws.  Freddy Rodriguez's performance is understated, although his mental turmoil is palpable.  John Leguizamo as Mauricio is less memorable.  The best part of this film is the ensemble acting, where everyone fits in naturally, without any one person stealing the show.  The result feels more like a real family than a manufactured one.The one thing that really bugged me about this DVD was the after-dubbing that sometimes doesn't match the lip movements of the actors.  At first I thought that the film might have been originally in Spanish and that I had accidentally watched the dubbed version.  However, the actors' voices are their own, in English, with occasional subtitles when the characters speak Spanish.  I suspect that some scenes needed to be re-shot, and that they had to re-record the voices without re-shooting the scenes.This film has the typical holiday message behind it:  life is short, and you should embrace your family for what it is.  Take your happiness while you can.  But the Puerto Rican culture, the Chicago landscape, and the ensemble acting give this film enough heart to elevate it above more mundane holiday efforts.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",4,"Christmas Near Humboldt Park, Puerto Rican Style",1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,2590,"['warm', 'often', 'amusing', 'holiday', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'version', 'ofHome', 'Holidays', 'set', 'Christmas', 'rather', 'Thanksgiving', 'still', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'member', 'his/her', 'own', 'drama', 'heart', 'Jessie', 'Iraqi', 'War', 'veteran', 'home', 'holidays', 'wounded', 'physically', 'mentally', 'sister', 'Roxanna', 'one', 'everyone', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'family', 'role', 'undercurrents', 'hidden', 'failure', 'Brother', 'Mauricio', 'Jewish', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'who', 'gamely', 'embrace', 'culture', 'have', 'own', 'issues', 'family', 'presided', 'father', 'Edy', 'mother', 'Anna', 'couple', 'obviously', 'love', 'unwilling', 'confront', 'unhappiness', 'Anna', 'so', 'dramatically', 'dinner', 'table', 'Add', 'cast', 'extended', 'relatives', 'lost', 'loves', 'potentially', 'deadly', 'confrontation', 'have', 'boisterous', 'family', 'drama', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'rooting', 'happiness', 'safety', 'everyone', 'involved', 'cultural', 'details', 'arise', 'naturally', 'setting', 'plot', 'make', 'film', 'memorable', 'more', 'just', 'holiday', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'happy.Alfred', 'Molina', 'Edy', 'quietly', 'effective', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'liking', 'character', 'occasional', 'idiocy', 'Elizabeth', 'Pena', 'wife', 'Anna', 'even', 'better', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Sarah', 'upright', 'staid', 'awkward', 'first', 'trust', 'in-laws', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'performance', 'understated', 'mental', 'turmoil', 'palpable', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Mauricio', 'less', 'memorable', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'where', 'everyone', 'naturally', 'one', 'person', 'stealing', 'show', 'result', 'more', 'real', 'family', 'manufactured', 'one.The', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'bugged', 'DVD', 'was', 'after-dubbing', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'match', 'lip', 'movements', 'actors', 'first', 'thought', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'originally', 'Spanish', 'had', 'accidentally', 'watched', 'dubbed', 'version', 'However', 'actors', 'voices', 'are', 'own', 'English', 'occasional', 'subtitles', 'when', 'characters', 'speak', 'Spanish', 'suspect', 'scenes', 'needed', 'be', 're-shot', 'had', 're-record', 'voices', 're-shooting', 'scenes.This', 'film', 'typical', 'holiday', 'message', 'life', 'short', 'should', 'embrace', 'family', 'what', 'Take', 'happiness', 'can', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'culture', 'Chicago', 'landscape', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'give', 'film', 'enough', 'heart', 'elevate', 'more', 'mundane', 'holiday', 'efforts.', 'Debbie', 'Lee', 'Wesselmann']",Nothing Like the Holidays

1214543,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001LK8UP0,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","If you can envision mixing Thomas Bezucha'sThe Family Stone(2005) with Lin-Manuel Miranda'sIn The Heights(still running on Broadway), you will get a rough idea of what this 2008 family drama is all about. It's refreshing to see a holiday feature focused on the vibrancy of the Hispanic community, and director Alfredo De Villa does an energetic job celebrating the ethnicity found in Chicago's Puerto Rican-dominated Humboldt Park neighborhood. However, he gets little help from the by-the-numbers screenplay by Rick Najera and Alison Swan, which is mired in clich&eacute;s and stock characters. The story works strictly within predictable convention by using a Christmas family reunion as an excuse for melodramatic revelations and confrontations among its members.The plot elements are laid on thick. The Rodriguez family is headed by jovial bodega owner Edy, whose recently secretive behavior has convinced his hot-tempered wife Emma that he is having an affair. She unceremoniously announces at the family dinner table that she wants to file for a divorce. Oldest son Mauricio has become a smug, rather insufferable New Yorker and brings with him his high-powered wife Sarah, an uptight gringo on the verge of managing her own $300 million hedge fund. Much to Emma's chagrin, they have decided to put off having children to focus on their careers. Looking battle-weary and acting disengaged, younger son Jesse has just come home from a tour of duty in Iraq to find his ex-girlfriend settled down with another man. Daughter Roxanna is a struggling actress in LA whom the neighborhood thinks is going to be the next big star. Her life gets complicated by a budding romance with ex-gang member Ozzy, who is tormented by the shooting death of his brother. And as if it isn't obvious, an old, ugly tree in the Rodriguez front yard stands as a symbol of the family's solidarity.All the characters are sketched in broad strokes rather than developed with nuance, so the film feels more  suitable as a TBS TV show. Nonetheless, the cast is likeable and sometimes a bit more when given the chance. Alfred Molina (Spider-Man 2), a Brit of Spanish-Italian ancestry, has mastered a diverse array of ethnic roles in his career and plays Edy with convincing Latino flavor. Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a (Lone Star) is a welcome sight as Emma. A surprisingly restrained John Leguizamo (Moulin Rouge!) plays Mauricio, and an unsurprising Debra Messing (Will & Grace) plays to type as Sarah. Effective albeit limited work comes from Vanessa Ferlito (Grindhouse) as Roxana, Jay Hernandez (World Trade Center) as Ozzy, and Luis Guzm&aacute;n providing comic relief as a jokester cousin obsessed with his hair. The film's best performance comes from Freddy Rodriguez (Federico inSix Feet Under) who realistically conveys Jesse's pain with a minimum of help from the trite script. Paul Oakenfold contributes the percolating soundtrack. The 200 DVD offers an entertaining commentary track from De Villa, Rodriguez, and producer Robert Teitel; a 12-minute featurette that reunites some of the cast members to discuss the making of the film; the original theatrical trailer; and the inescapable blooper reel.",3,A Latino Family Christmas Well Cast But the Story Is Mired in Clich&eacute;s,1259366400,"11 28, 2009",2009,3180,"['can', 'envision', 'mixing', 'Thomas', ""Bezucha'sThe"", 'Family', 'Stone', '2005', 'Lin-Manuel', ""Miranda'sIn"", 'Heights', 'still', 'running', 'Broadway', 'will', 'get', 'rough', 'idea', 'what', '2008', 'family', 'drama', 'refreshing', 'see', 'holiday', 'feature', 'focused', 'vibrancy', 'Hispanic', 'community', 'director', 'Alfredo', 'De', 'Villa', 'energetic', 'job', 'celebrating', 'ethnicity', 'found', 'Chicago', 'Puerto', 'Rican-dominated', 'Humboldt', 'Park', 'neighborhood', 'However', 'little', 'help', 'by-the-numbers', 'screenplay', 'Rick', 'Najera', 'Alison', 'Swan', 'mired', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'stock', 'characters', 'story', 'strictly', 'predictable', 'convention', 'using', 'Christmas', 'family', 'reunion', 'excuse', 'melodramatic', 'revelations', 'confrontations', 'members.The', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'laid', 'thick', 'Rodriguez', 'family', 'headed', 'jovial', 'bodega', 'owner', 'Edy', 'recently', 'secretive', 'behavior', 'convinced', 'hot-tempered', 'wife', 'Emma', 'having', 'affair', 'unceremoniously', 'family', 'dinner', 'table', 'file', 'divorce', 'Oldest', 'son', 'Mauricio', 'become', 'smug', 'rather', 'insufferable', 'New', 'Yorker', 'brings', 'high-powered', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'uptight', 'gringo', 'verge', 'managing', 'own', '300', 'million', 'hedge', 'fund', 'Much', 'Emma', 'chagrin', 'have', 'decided', 'put', 'off', 'having', 'children', 'focus', 'careers', 'Looking', 'battle-weary', 'acting', 'disengaged', 'younger', 'son', 'Jesse', 'just', 'come', 'home', 'tour', 'duty', 'Iraq', 'find', 'ex-girlfriend', 'settled', 'down', 'man', 'Daughter', 'Roxanna', 'struggling', 'actress', 'LA', 'whom', 'neighborhood', 'going', 'be', 'next', 'big', 'star', 'life', 'complicated', 'budding', 'romance', 'ex-gang', 'member', 'Ozzy', 'who', 'tormented', 'shooting', 'death', 'brother', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'old', 'ugly', 'tree', 'Rodriguez', 'front', 'yard', 'symbol', 'family', 'characters', 'are', 'sketched', 'broad', 'strokes', 'rather', 'developed', 'nuance', 'film', 'feels', 'more', 'suitable', 'TBS', 'TV', 'show', 'Nonetheless', 'cast', 'likeable', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'more', 'when', 'given', 'chance', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'Brit', 'Spanish-Italian', 'ancestry', 'mastered', 'diverse', 'array', 'ethnic', 'roles', 'career', 'Edy', 'convincing', 'Latino', 'flavor', 'Elizabeth', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'Lone', 'Star', 'welcome', 'sight', 'Emma', 'A', 'surprisingly', 'restrained', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Mauricio', 'unsurprising', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Will', 'Grace', 'type', 'Sarah', 'Effective', 'albeit', 'limited', 'work', 'Vanessa', 'Ferlito', 'Grindhouse', 'Roxana', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Ozzy', 'Luis', 'Guzm', 'aacute', 'providing', 'comic', 'relief', 'jokester', 'cousin', 'obsessed', 'hair', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'Federico', 'inSix', 'Feet', 'who', 'realistically', 'conveys', 'Jesse', 'pain', 'minimum', 'help', 'trite', 'script', 'Paul', 'Oakenfold', 'percolating', 'soundtrack', '200', 'DVD', 'offers', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'track', 'De', 'Villa', 'Rodriguez', 'producer', 'Robert', 'Teitel', '12-minute', 'featurette', 'cast', 'members', 'discuss', 'making', 'film', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'inescapable', 'blooper', 'reel']",Nothing Like the Holidays

We enter this club by accepting free copies of products but we promise in return to submit an opinion.Nothing like the holidays evokes the feelings we share during the Christmas holiday season, as family members that have moved away and created new lives come back to the nest only to realize that family is the number one priority in their lives.The movie reminded me of ""A big, fat, Greek wedding"" as it celebrates the lives of a Puerto Rican family, deep into family traditions, sharing music, food, stories, and beliefs as they come together in celebration of the greatest tradition of all; the Christmas Holidays.The movie invites us to become part of the celebration as it honestly presents the dysfunction that goes along with relationships that comprehend different cultures, language and generations. We become part of the group, rather than mere observers, laughing at their joy and happiness, but dealing with the pain of suppressed emotions, betrayal and career frustration.The movie takes us to Chicago, into the home of Eduardo and Anna Rodriguez masterfully played by Alfred Molina and Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a, as they welcome their children and their partners for the holidays.The daughter moved away to California to find success in acting, but she soon reveals that her life does not reflect the glamour they all dream, in reality she is nothing but a struggling want to be who lives in expectation of her agent's call to know whether she will get a part on something promising.One of the sons has done a tour in Iraq and is emotionally scarred by the War because a dear friend died and he was unable to prevent it. Freddy Rodriguez plays the part of Jesse with such ardor that we suffer right along with him as he tries to find purpose with his family and an ex-girlfriend.The other son, an attorney by the name of Mauricio, played by John Liguizamo comes home with his wife, Sarah, played by Debra Messing, adding the cultural mix that tests what they stand for, in the end, Sarah becomes integral in the resolution of generational differences.The movie has a bit of it all, romance, sex, revenge, comedy, all woven together to provide a view to the traditions of a family with a Puerto Rican heritage. One of the most enjoyable scenes is the celebration of a ""parranda."" Puerto Ricans are known for their unforgettable ""parrandas or trullas navide&ntilde;as."" A parranda is when a small group of friends gathers together to surprise another friend, sort of Christmas caroling.Most participants play some sort of instrument, either guitars, drums, or maracas while they sing. The group arrives at a neighbor's doorstep quietly and at a given signal they play their instruments, singing and inviting them to join in the celebration.This repeated from house to house until the entire vicinity joins in the celebration which culminates at a pre-determined place to enjoy music, dancing and deliciously prepared dishes shared by all friends and relatives.The movie invites us to celebrate Christmas in Chicago... thanks to the family values of Puerto Ricans in exile.Rather enjoyable, don't miss it!",4,Family values Puerto Rico style...,1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,3303,"['movie', 'review', 'part', 'obligation', 'Amazon', 'accepting', 'be', 'member', 'Vine', 'program', 'club', 'selected', 'customers', 'provide', 'opinions', 'new', 'pre-released', 'items', 'enter', 'club', 'accepting', 'free', 'copies', 'products', 'promise', 'return', 'submit', 'opinion.Nothing', 'holidays', 'evokes', 'feelings', 'share', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'season', 'family', 'members', 'have', 'moved', 'away', 'created', 'new', 'lives', 'come', 'back', 'nest', 'only', 'realize', 'family', 'number', 'one', 'priority', 'lives.The', 'movie', 'reminded', 'A', 'big', 'fat', 'Greek', 'wedding', 'lives', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'family', 'deep', 'family', 'traditions', 'sharing', 'music', 'food', 'stories', 'beliefs', 'come', 'together', 'celebration', 'greatest', 'tradition', 'Christmas', 'Holidays.The', 'movie', 'become', 'part', 'celebration', 'honestly', 'dysfunction', 'along', 'relationships', 'comprehend', 'different', 'cultures', 'language', 'generations', 'become', 'part', 'group', 'rather', 'mere', 'observers', 'laughing', 'joy', 'happiness', 'dealing', 'pain', 'suppressed', 'emotions', 'betrayal', 'career', 'frustration.The', 'movie', 'Chicago', 'home', 'Eduardo', 'Anna', 'Rodriguez', 'masterfully', 'played', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Elizabeth', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'welcome', 'children', 'partners', 'holidays.The', 'daughter', 'moved', 'away', 'California', 'find', 'success', 'acting', 'soon', 'reveals', 'life', 'not', 'reflect', 'glamour', 'dream', 'reality', 'nothing', 'struggling', 'want', 'be', 'who', 'expectation', 'agent', 'call', 'know', 'will', 'get', 'part', 'something', 'promising.One', 'sons', 'done', 'tour', 'Iraq', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'War', 'dear', 'friend', 'died', 'was', 'unable', 'prevent', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'part', 'Jesse', 'such', 'ardor', 'suffer', 'right', 'find', 'purpose', 'family', 'ex-girlfriend.The', 'other', 'son', 'attorney', 'name', 'Mauricio', 'played', 'John', 'Liguizamo', 'home', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'played', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'adding', 'cultural', 'mix', 'what', 'stand', 'end', 'Sarah', 'integral', 'resolution', 'generational', 'differences.The', 'movie', 'bit', 'romance', 'sex', 'revenge', 'comedy', 'woven', 'together', 'provide', 'view', 'traditions', 'family', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'heritage', 'One', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'scenes', 'celebration', 'parranda', 'Puerto', 'Ricans', 'are', 'known', 'unforgettable', 'parrandas', 'trullas', 'ntilde', 'parranda', 'when', 'small', 'group', 'friends', 'gathers', 'together', 'surprise', 'friend', 'sort', 'Christmas', 'caroling.Most', 'participants', 'play', 'sort', 'instrument', 'guitars', 'drums', 'maracas', 'sing', 'group', 'neighbor', 'doorstep', 'quietly', 'given', 'signal', 'play', 'instruments', 'singing', 'inviting', 'join', 'celebration.This', 'repeated', 'house', 'house', 'entire', 'vicinity', 'celebration', 'pre-determined', 'place', 'enjoy', 'music', 'dancing', 'deliciously', 'prepared', 'dishes', 'shared', 'friends', 'relatives.The', 'movie', 'celebrate', 'Christmas', 'Chicago', 'thanks', 'family', 'values', 'Puerto', 'Ricans', 'enjoyable', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss']",Nothing Like the Holidays

1214548,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B001LK8UP0,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[2, 2]","NOTHING LIKE THE HOLIDAYSWhen watching this movie I noticed something crazy going on and it hit home with me a little, well more so than that. This movie more or less is actually happing to me right now, so that may affect how much I like or dislike this film. This may be a spoiler so you may want to turn away now if you don't want to know. But as of now during Christmas my family has come together up at my mom's in Maryland. Nextly and to add to the time period comparison is that this film about a Latin family is true with me as well since my brother, sister, and girl all are at least half Latin of some kind. And lastly much like the father in this film my mother has cancer; she will beat it no doubt as she has before [twice]. So I can relate with this film in many ways and thusly appreciate it a lot more.The Rodriguez family is finally all going to be home together as all members from direct to family friends will all be coming back to Chicago. Of course some are still there like the parents and family friends, cousins and such. But one son and wife are coming away from their big jobs, the daughter is coming home from Hollywood, and another son is coming back from serving time in the military over in the war. Of course the parents could not be happier and the family business is going good but a lot of tension and jealousy is bubbling underneath the surface. For the parents the husband is getting mysterious phone calls that are putting a strain on the relationship, potentially leading to a divorce. The married son is having marital problems of his own since his career driven wife does not want kids like he does, and the famous movie star daughter is not as famous as she says. In fact she is still waiting on a call from her agent that could lead to her biggest role yet. And then there is the war hero son that is not so proud of what happened over seas that lead to his return home and the pressure put on him by his father to take over the family business is crushing him. Add in a bitter ex girlfriend who has moved on with someone else and you have the makings of the typical family Christmas.We open with nothing more than good times as war hero son Jesse Rodriguez [Freddy Rodriguez] is being picked up by best friend Johnny [Luis Gusman] and Ozzy [Jay Hernandez]. Good times are had after as all of the family makes their way to the parent's house [Alfred Molina & Elizabeth Pena], son Mauricio [John Leguizamo] and his wife Sarah [Debra Messing] arrive as well. Their acting sister Roxanna [Vanessa Ferlito] shows as well of course and the family is all together once more for the first time in forever apparently. Still the good times role even after Jesse's ex and her new man show up, as the family gathers for a huge meal the fun kicks in. It is at this point that all is revealed and the family starts to fight like only a family can. We all know how that works out since your family can throw all kinds of personal hurtful stuff out there.Of course the film not only deals with the family's problems but with the friends as well and Johnny wants to kill the man that killed his brother and is now free on the streets. That is explored as far as it could be and results in a good moment. Of course as mentioned before the father has cancer and is battling that through the holidays. This is the par that hits home with me the most as it is happening right now with my mama, I love my mama. This story arc got especially emotional for not only me, my brother, and sister but mostly for my grandparents [her parents]. My grandmother in particular has she cannot stand what is happing to her baby. But much like the father in this my mother is strong and will beat this without a doubt. She will be the three time defending champ against cancer after battling and beating brain cancer since that tumor was supposed to kill her. Then there was a separate non related cancer in her uterus, and now another different non related cancer that attacked many different parts of her.Aside from my personal stuff going on there is also wonderful performances and such from all. Alfred Molina is brilliant as the father in this film giving a wonderful performance, his battle with cancer hits home. His wife played by Elizabeth Pena is very strong and should be noted that she steals scenes easily. Freddy Rodriguez is great as the son who returns home after being injured in the war, he also is scared in more ways than one. Luis Gusman and  Jay Hernandez are great as well as the two friends that are there to pick him up, one is really funny and the other is a little more deep. Vanessa Ferlito is wonderful as always as the sister aspiring for an acting career.  John Leguizamo and Debra Messing are absolutely perfect as a married couple who are having problems in deciding if they want a baby, add in Debra is white in an all Latin family and you have real fun then. Alexander Bautista, Melonie Diaz, Ramses Jimenez, and Manny Sosa all turn in great performances as well. Turns out to be very wonderfully acted, of course it is all in how much you relate.To be honest I may have enjoyed this more so than the average viewer but I would still recommend this film. Check it out as a rental at least because it is a good movie regardless. Director Alfredo De Villa and writers Alison Swan, Rick Najera, Robert Teitel, and Rene M. Rigal all did a good job with this film. The film is funny at times and a little more dramatic at others, there is something for everybody in this. Does this film have problems, to be honest it probably does but I liked it. Maybe the situation affected my judgment but isn't that the point of a review.",5,I CAN RELATE TO THIS,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,5665,"['NOTHING', 'THE', 'HOLIDAYSWhen', 'watching', 'movie',

Well almost anything.What I don't care for are movies that rely on time-tested story material with only minor changes based on family ethnicity and general dynamics.I'm a realist; many American holiday tales look the same from family to family regardless of cultural heritage. Having been raised in several ethnically diverse households, the biggest differences lie in what we eat, when we go to church, and some activities the family does when they get together.But the basic plot and players are the same.Nothing Like the Holidays was enjoyable for its acting primarily. I got a few good laughs out of it.Beyond this, I felt there were too many sub-stories going on that were only held together loosely by the meta-story. Further, I often found myself thinking ""Oh, I've seen this character's story in __________"".Overall, this is a serviceable holiday film enhanced by Puerto Rican aspects. I wondered if this would be more enjoyable to Puerto Ricans (particularly in the Chicago area) or if they'd think it was too flat as well.I give it three stars because it's a relatively cute albeit mindless holiday dramedy.

1214552,A8MZA6YR9UAN9,B001LK8UP0,JET,"[2, 2]","""Nothing Like the Holidays,"" with quite a few great actors (Alfred Molina, Debra Messing, John Leguizamo), had me expecting something special. The back description promises that it is ""touching and laugh out loud funny."" Other reviews have described the premise in detail, so I won't rehash it here, but will just summarize it by saying that the core members of the Puerto Rican Rodriguez family, and some extended members, are all together for Christmas. There are many misunderstandings, old relationships, personal struggles, and troubled relationships, but all ends up (more or less) well in the end.My biggest problem with the movie was that it tries to straddle the shaky ground of holiday movies between ""touching"" and ""funny,"" but ends up being neither and just being mostly depressing. Rest assured, this is no ""Love, Actually,"" which is both touching and laugh-out-loud funny, and also a movie that I look forward to watching every holiday season. Overall, the movie is fine. The acting is solid (with a couple of understated performances by Debra Messing and John Leguizamo), the movie is well done, but it just doesn't get off the ground. I found very little funny, and there is a lot of heavy material here. There's nothing wrong with that in a holiday movie, but there is so much of it (illnesses, loves lost, dead soldiers, philandering husbands) that none of it reaches very deeply, either in story line or in touching the audience.Coming away from this movie, I knew that I wouldn't repeat the experience and wouldn't recommend it for others looking for a touching or funny holiday movie. Two things I did like: the nice, scenic views of Chicago that were scattered throughout the movie and the insight into Puerto Rican holiday traditions, although some of the scenes were a bit cheesy and cliched.

Menta, Jr.","[1, 1]","Enjoyable Christmas drama that, due to its setting in a Puerto Rican neighborhood in Chicago and the Puerto Rican family at the heart of the story, doesn't feel like the million other Christmas-themed movies out there.  The scattered family members in ""Nothing Like the Holidays"" come together one Christmas and interact in entertaining fashion.  They compare problems, gently poke and criticize each other, witness one or two crises that family members openly or reluctanly reveal, and generally act like the imperfect but loving parents and offspring they are.While definitely not choppy, I got the sense that the movie might have been longer its its first cut, but then trimmed down to keep things moving.  Which is okay, because while certain individual stories seemed to cry out for more detail, each character at least gets the minimum needed to sufficiently sketch out his or her individual situation.A highlight of the film is Debra Messing's character, a Jewish investment banker who married into the family and is having trouble fitting in.  What's interesting about her character is that the same attributes that are making it difficult for her to form a bond with her husband's family (hesitating about having kids, her job taking precedence over family issues, etc.) give her the distance to to avoid being judgemental when a crisis involving her mother and father in law pops up.  Her unexpected bonding and support with her in-laws is touching to see.I liked that the movie moved toward a generally upbeat conclusion, but without everything turning out perfect for everyone.  Among the many characters, there's hope but still uncertainty, and mature but bittersweet acceptance.  And, oh yes- there's lots of good food and music and overlapping family conversations to hold it all together.""Nothing Like the Holidays"" looks and sounds great on standard DVD and there are a few short but entertaining extra features, as well as a commentary track.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 6]","Films with the same premise as ""Nothing Like The Holidays"" are abundant--in fact, I've seen more family homecoming stories centered around the holidays than I care to admit.  Generally amiable and predictable, you can count on a few laughs at the typical dysfunction, a bit of tension at the long held grudges, and finally some warmth as mutual understanding and the meaning of ""family"" send us to the finale.  But I'm no Scrooge, just because I know where we're headed doesn't mean it can't be an enjoyable ride!  And I was pleasantly entertained by ""Nothing Like The Holidays.""  It may not be a new Yuletide classic but a colorful and committed cast breathe fresh life into rather familiar situations.  Alternately touching and humorous, the film ultimately won me over with its heart.Set in Chicago, ""Nothing Like The Holidays"" presents Christmas from a Puerto Rican family's vantage point.  The nominal star of this ensemble picture is Freddy Rodriguez (""Six Feet Under""), a son returning from overseas service.  He's solid here providing a center for the movie.  But he's surrounded by many familiar faces such as Elizabeth Pena and Alfred Molina as the parents, John Leguizamo as his brother, Debra Messing as Leguizamo's non-Puerto Rican wife, and Luiz Guzman and Jay Hernandez as his cousin and friend respectively.  Everyone does a nice job, but to single two people out--I'd have to look to the ladies.  Debra Messing is certainly NOT a favorite of mine in general, but she manages to pull a lot of dignity out of what could have been the film's most thankless role.  It is Elizabeth Pena, however, that I most appreciated--a talented actress who finally has a meaty role to showcase her abilities.Well executed and well acted, ""Nothing Like The Holidays"" certainly plays as a comedy first and foremost.  I think that's where it is on its firmest footing with many scenes being laugh out loud funny.  The humor comes from identifiable situations that anyone who has been a part of family gatherings can appreciate.  The more serious bits work as well, but only because the comedy has drawn you into the family dynamic.  Ultimately I was rooting for this group.  And that's really all you can hope for, in the end.  I cared for the family and wanted to see where their journey led me.  So how can I not recommend ""Nothing Like The Holidays?""  It's a modest film, and if you approach it with modest expectations--you might just be pleasantly surprised.

It's like a who's who of Hispanic actors, although many of them are not actually Puerto Rican.  Some are Cuban, Spanish, Italian and Mexican.

His mother Anna played by the delightful Elizabeth Pena gets angrier with each call, assuming her husband is having yet another affair.  Luiz Guzman plays Johnny who has a knack for saying exactly the wrong thing at the wrong time.  John Leguizamo plays Mauricio who brings his wife Sarah home for the holidays.  Debra Messing's Sarah is the only non-Latina in the family, which seems to create misunderstandings.  The chaotic lack of communication swirls around the symbol of an old tree that mother Anna wants cut down.

1214561,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001LK8UP0,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Ever since the beginning of film, holidays features have found their way into the hearts and pocketbooks of film goers everywhere. For the most part they have been touching remembrances of winters past, Christmas extravaganzas or touching tributes to family and friends as they gather together to celebrate. But times change and while the family may yet come together, they do so a bit differently as seen in NOTHING LIKE THE HOLIDAYS.The story involves the Christmas get together of the Rodriguez family, a moderately successful group in the Humboldt Park area of west Chicago. This Puerto Rican family does things in a style that stimulates and displays life out loud. And that's a good thing.Coming together for the first time in ages are all of the children. Jesse (Freddy Rodriguez) has just returned home from a tour of duty in Iraq where he witnessed the death of a fellow solider, blaming himself in the process. Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) is in from California where the family thinks she's become a major movie/TV star. And Mauricio (John Leguizamo) and his wife Sarah (Debra Messing), a successful white collar couple, are in town as well, all the while questioned by mother Anna (Elizabeth Pena) why they haven't given her grandchildren yet.Yes, this family celebrates life passionately. Along with uncle Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), the young man who works in father Edy's (Alfred Molina) store, the whole bunch comes together to celebrate family. Until mom drops the bomb on them that she's divorcing dad.It seems Edy cheated once on Anna and she's never forgiven him. And now he's taken to being secretive about something, taking phone calls in private and hiding whatever it is. It's enough to convince her that he's doing it once again.The family is torn by this idea of the divorce. On one hand they want to support both their parents. On the other they want them to remain together. And at the same time each one has demons of their own to deal with.Roxanna is not the star everyone back home thinks she is, waiting with cell phone in hand to find out if she's gotten the part to make or break her career. Jesse is disturbed by his time at war as well as dealing with the girl he left behind who is now involved with someone else. And Mauricio is dealing with bouncing between allegiance to his wife or to his mother.Watching over all is Edy, taking in the whole picture. This character has more depth than is witnessed in words alone. He is the quiet one, trying to have a family holiday to outdo all others. And at the same time he has a secret that could prove devastating to them all. And it's not at all what Anna suspects.This film offers a great combination of humor and tenderness that shows what being a family is all about. Its not about just the good times or the bad, it's about living life. You can take the safe path as long as you like, but never see the beauty of the world in doing so.In the midst of this family is Sarah, the outsider, who may take a lot of guff from Anna, but who loves her husband and wants so much to be a part of this family. She gets her wish when she accidentally discovers Edy's secret. It's a burden more than the rest carry and one that is revealed by the end of the film.Not sweet as the candy of RUDOLPH, not as bitter as A CHRISTMAS CAROL and not as tear jerking as ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE, this film presents a different world at Christmas than we're used to. And perhaps that's a good thing.In a world where the family is falling apart, where single parents are becoming the norm, it's nice to see a film that focuses on the family, even if they are a bit different. It reminds us that the holidays are a time to get together. They are a time when family should be as one. With love, with laughter, with plenty of heart and with a touch of sadness, this film triggers all the emotions that a good holiday film can.

But, when there are movies that do make that attempt, they don't seem to carry well. That honestly does come to that same point with the movie Nothing Like The Holidays. The film about a mixed-up and awkward Hispanic family that reunites for a Christmas they won't forget. While the movie seemed to be a bit catchy with the all-star cast, including John Leguizamo from Ice Age and Will & Grace's Debra Messing.I saw the comedy and I was a bit unhappy at times. The movie focused on a Hispanic-oriented family with all different kinds of backgrounds from a soldier coming home from Iraq, to a wannabe actress whom doesn't get her roles, going apart at the seems. It goes into a harsher tailspin when the parents decide to go ahead with a possibilty of a divorce. As a result, the family learns that there is more for themselves from John & Debra's characters trying to go for a attempt to have children of their own, for her to please the in-laws, to the mother & father, a bodega owner, going through the consideration of the divorce, while in the process, finding out he has cancer and not telling the family, over the feeling that he knew his family wasn't going to care about it, and not let it spoil the holidays for the family.All in all, I thought Nothing Like The Holidays was going to be a funny movie. While there were some moments that were entertaining, I felt that it just doesn't match the feeling other holiday comedies have shown, like Mixed Nuts with Steve Marin or Home Alone have shown.

1214564,A2I3XS9TO93Q0F,B001LK8UP0,"Michael Meredith ""e-Mike""","[1, 1]","I think that Christmas movies deserve to be regarded with a separate set of criteria than that applied to the rest of cinema.  If the movie revolves around the Christmas holiday, we're likely to forgive the extra cliche' or manipulative tear-jerking moment that might just cost a non-holiday ensemble comedy a star or two.  So with that said, Nothing Like the Holidays might just be worth adding to your collection of DVDs.  How better to amuse the out-of-town family guests (or their adolescent kids) during those post-feedbag hours?If I sound like I'm damning this movie with faint praise, I don't exactly intend to.  In some respects, Nothing Like the Holidays is a perfect little niche DVD to have around; entertaining, funny and one that your guests probably didn't see when it hit the theaters.  It's anchored by Alfred Molina as the father of the Puerto Rican clan that's scattered somewhat geographically and reassembles for Christmas.  Molina is a solid actor, and I hope he someday gets another role like the one he had in Frida (as Diego Rivera).  This isn't that vehicle, but Molina can deliver even holiday cliche's and still seem genuine.One other notable within the cast is Luis Guzman, who at times steals the show away from other better known names in the cast.  You may not recognize his name, but I guarantee that you'll recognize his face.If this movie was titled ""Nothing Like the Third Week in July"", I would probably have just given it 3 stars.  It's pleasant, funny and you will probably enjoy it just fine.

However in ""Nothing Like The Holidays,"" the script led this movie all over the place. The heavy-handed direction didn't help matters. I was pulling for this movie, but I just simply got pulled out of caring about it.For instance, the movie opens with the son coming home from serving in Iraq, obviously injured (eye patch). Fun-loving cousins pick him up from the airport and joke around in the car on the way home, then suddenly it's ominous and tense as the son looks out car window and sees...people? Places? that make him scared and tense and grim. (GET IT? He's scared and tense at something he sees, GET IT?) But there's no explanation and the movie goes back then to being a big-family holiday movie, as we get to the house.Then tense tight-a** daughter-in-law Debra Messing (Love her!) from Will and Grace is introduced. We see she doesn't like to hug, but the other family members hug and kiss each other with wild abandon. (GET IT? They don't get along with her because she's a tense repressed tight a**, GET IT?) We see the family-owned bodega. Clumsy amateurish foreshadowing of dad flirting with pretty customer. (GET IT? He's an old married man but he's a FLIRT, get it??)As obvious as the direction was in some cases, in other cases the script completely falls apart and we have no idea how things happened. The mother drops a bombshell, the family fights, Debra Messing is having a blast with the family in a bar...wait, how did that happen? No idea. She and John Leguizamo are close, warm and happily married. Wait, how did that happen? No idea. The scary people or places the son saw...who were they? No idea. Is that the same scary guys, who enter the bodega, then leave quickly? No idea.The actors and actresses give fantastic performances all around.

When a Puerto Rican family gathers to celebrate Christmas, they end up celebrating Life as each family member's story unfolds.The family comprises a father (owner of a local Bodega/supermarket), his wife and three grown children, scattered across the U.S. and Iraq. One son is vying for partner in a New York law firm and is married to a successful Wall Street fund manager, who is not Puerto Rican and does not share her mother-in-law's urgency to produce a grandchild.  Another son is a war hero, returning from Iraq and plagued by guilt because by a stroke of fate, one of his fellow soldiers dies instead of him.  Though family and friends believe the daughter is very successful, she is striving with minimal success to ""make it"" in Hollywood.  Buried in all this are family secrets.  After 36 years and seemingly in love, was the father unfaithful to his wife?  What else can the family conclude?This is a happy, upbeat movie, perfect as a Holiday diversion and filled with dancing and music.

We have Jesse, who is  war hero and faces guilt over something that happened while in Iraq and his friend was killed.  Johnny, a comic side kick and Jesse's cousin.  Ozzy, whose brother was killed and he wants revenge. Mauricio, Jesse's brother, married to a woman, Sarah,  not of their nationality, is a work addict. Sarah also wants to get ahead with her work, is not ready for children, even though she is 36, and is trying to fit into the family. And sister Roxanna, a hopeful actress who secures a role in a film but turns it down for personal reasons.

Each with their own personal issues that come front and center within the span of the movie.I have to admit that I thought this movie would be one of comedy, and although it had its moments, generally speaking it was a movie of deep seated emotions within each family member that needed to be dealt with and resolved to the best ends possible. Secrets were revealed, hidden emotions freed as each family member worked their part in the drama being played out. I feel it did show the complexity of family, the different paths each individual life had taken and the results thereof, yet the bond that is somehow placed within most families was drawn upon in many occasions to help one another.

If it isn't the first, it's certainly a rare thing.  And for that reason alone ""Nothing Like the Holidays"" is probably worth watching.  I can certainly see it being valued by Hispanics or, at the very least, Puerto Ricans.But as others have noted, there isn't a lot here.  The acting is excellent for the most part.  But the various stories within the movie had all been told before and better.Given that Rodriguez produced the film and grew up in Chicago, I'm going to assume that it was faithful to the culture it was presenting.  However, there are spots when Rodriquez specifically fails to be authentic when it comes to him playing the role of a soldier.At the beginning of the film we see him with quite a bit of facial hair on his chin while he's in uniform.  It's easily a week's worth of growth if not more.  As an ex-soldier, I can't imagine how he'd get away with this even if he wanted to.  In the same scene he puts his hands nonchalantly in his uniform pants pockets.  Not something someone from the service (especially a Marine!) typically does.  And then there were multiple scenes where Rodriquez was shown with his dog tags outside his shirt ala John Wayne.  Again, that's not how real soldiers behave.  Those are the actions of a wannabe soldier who's trying to look tough.  All of this is rather minor I suppose, but it pulled me out of the story because it lacked authenticity and Rodriquez's character is central to the movie.  I couldn't get past the fact that he didn't act like a soldier home from the war.I'm betting most probably won't care about this issue or even notice.  With that in mind, I give a guarded recommendation - watch it for the acting and the ethnic diversity we've lacked in mainstream movies, but don't expect a great story.",3,"Groundbreaking for the ethnic presentation, but not the story",1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,1939,"['Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'who', 'stars', 'movie', 'produced', 'stated', 'interview', 'as', 'far', 'knew', 'was', 'first', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'Latin', 'stars', ""n't"", 'first', 'certainly', 'rare', 'thing', 'reason', 'alone', 'Nothing', 'Holidays', 'probably', 'worth', 'watching', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'being', 'valued', 'Hispanics', 'very', 'least', 'Puerto', 'Ricans.But', 'others', 'have', 'noted', ""n't"", 'lot', 'here', 'acting', 'excellent', 'most', 'part', 'various', 'stories', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'better.Given', 'Rodriguez', 'produced', 'film', 'grew', 'up', 'Chicago', ""'m"", 'going', 'assume', 'was', 'faithful', 'culture', 'was', 'presenting', 'However', 'are', 'spots', 'when', 'Rodriquez', 'specifically', 'be', 'authentic', 'when', 'playing', 'role', 'soldier.At', 'beginning', 'film', 'see', 'quite', 'bit', 'facial', 'hair', 'chin', 'uniform', 'easily', 'week', 'worth', 'growth', 'not', 'more', 'ex-soldier', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', ""'d"", 'get', 'away', 'even', 'wanted', 'same', 'scene', 'hands', 'nonchalantly', 'uniform', 'pants', 'pockets', 'Not', 'something', 'someone', 'service', 'especially', 'Marine', 'typically', 'then', 'were', 'multiple', 'scenes', 'where', 'Rodriquez', 'was', 'shown', 'dog', 'tags', 'shirt', 'ala', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Again', 'not', 'how', 'real', 'soldiers', 'behave', 'are', 'actions', 'wannabe', 'soldier', 'who', 'trying', 'look', 'tough', 'rather', 'minor', 'suppose', 'pulled', 'story', 'lacked', 'authenticity', 'Rodriquez', 'character', 'central', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'soldier', 'home', 'war.I', ""'m"", 'betting', 'most', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'issue', 'even', 'notice', 'mind', 'give', 'guarded', 'recommendation', 'watch', 'acting', 'ethnic', 'diversity', ""'ve"", 'lacked', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'story']",Nothing Like the Holidays

1214587,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001LK8UP0,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[2, 3]","Movies about the Christmas Holiday tone are a dime-a-dozen. Truthfully, most movies have the same plot clich&eacute;s, themes and Holiday cheers. Director Alfredo De Villa's ""NOTHING LIKE THE HOLIDAYS"" is nothing different; family issues, disappointments and hope abound in this dramedy. It does have a very strong Puerto Rican theme to it; with full emphasis on Puerto Rican.There is nothing like Christmas in the Rodriguez household, as parents Edy (Alfred Molina) and Anna (Elizabeth Pena) is welcoming their children back for the Christmas festivities. Special welcome is given to their son, Jesse (Freddy Rodriguez) since he is coming home after a tour in Iraq, Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) is struggling to make ends meet in Hollywood, and Mauricio (John Leguizamo) is arriving with his career-minded wife Sarah (Debra Messing). Old Friends are also coming to visit including Jesse's old flame, Marissa (Melanie Diaz) who has moved on, Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez) who works in Edy's bodega. Brought together more by Holiday obligation than actual ""wanting to be there""; family secrets and brewing feuds begin to threaten the enjoyment of the holidays...""Nothing Like the Holidays"" wears its Puerto Rican themes like a badge. The viewer is privy to some of the holiday traditions observed. The cultural disconnection may be tempting at first, but the film does manage to warm up with the familiar themes of the Christmas season. Actually, I was a little more curious as to what other traditions they have and after awhile, I kind of wished that it got more into those cultural traditions than the clich&eacute;d familial trappings of a holiday movie.There is nothing original in the manner things are set up in the movie. The film's characters all have their baggages to carry and the film's screenplay goes back and forth from humor to dramatic moments. There was a couple of plot elements that had potential; the subplots with Jesse and Ozzy was interesting enough but the film has too many performers vying for the limited screen time. The complications that gets revealed in the film's first half can get irritating, after all, how many things can possibly go wrong in a limited time frame but they do. The airing of grievances appear to be a little far-fetched to occur in such a short period of time (maybe my family dinners are more civilized?) that it would be hard to connect with those grievances. Not to get me wrong, it is possible, but I guess the set ups were a little too heavy-handed for me. It would've been a better move to stick to one theme but De Villa exhausts his viewers into pitching in too many subplots and then leaving them half-baked. The film feels like it is in a rush to cover too much ground that it ends up really going nowhere significant.The acting by Alfred Molina and Elizabeth Pena are very charismatic and effective; heck even Debra Messing was pretty good as the lone Caucasian woman in the Puerto Rican household. I suppose credit needs to be given to the performers but truth be told, Leguizamo is too old and Pena too young to be his mother (4 Years apart in real life?!). This is a major goof on the part of the direction. However, Pena and Molina does save the film's clich&eacute;d script by the potential divorce subplot and the two manages to convince that the situation is real. Despite some of my complaints, the cast do manage to pull it off by carrying most of the film's burden.""Nothing Like the Holidays"" can be fun to watch at times but I feel that the raw talent in the film is somewhat wasted because of the manner by which that there was too many subplots and that really didn't go anywhere. It covered too much ground without careful development and viewers may have issues connecting to the characters. The film can be endearing and it does have a lot of qualities; problem is, it just couldn't breathe and the direction struggles to really find its footing. Then again, I guess it may be this way on some households...?Rental [2  +Stars= mediocre to fair]",3,"""Anything Like Any Other Holiday Movie""",1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,4037,"['Movies', 'Christmas', 'Holiday', 'tone', 'are', 'dime-a-dozen', 'Truthfully', 'most', 'movies', 'have', 'same', 'plot', 'clich', 'eacute', 'themes', 'Holiday', 'cheers', 'Director', 'Alfredo', 'De', 'Villa', 'NOTHING', 'HOLIDAYS', 'nothing', 'different', 'family', 'issues', 'disappointments', 'hope', 'abound', 'dramedy', 'have', 'very', 'strong', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'theme', 'full', 'emphasis', 'Puerto', 'Rican.There', 'nothing', 'Christmas', 'Rodriguez', 'household', 'parents', 'Edy', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Anna', 'Elizabeth', 'Pena', 'welcoming', 'children', 'back', 'Christmas', 'festivities', 'Special', 'welcome', 'given', 'son', 'Jesse', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'coming', 'home', 'tour', 'Iraq', 'Roxanna', 'Vanessa', 'Ferlito', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Hollywood', 'Mauricio', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'arriving', 'career-minded', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Old', 'Friends', 'are', 'also', 'coming', 'visit', 'including', 'Jesse', 'old', 'flame', 'Marissa', 'Melanie', 'Diaz', 'who', 'moved', 'Johnny', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'Ozzy', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'who', 'Edy', 'bodega', 'Brought', 'together', 'more', 'Holiday', 'obligation', 'actual', 'wanting', 'be', 'there', 'family', 'secrets', 'brewing', 'feuds', 'begin', 'threaten', 'enjoyment', 'holidays', 'Nothing', 'Holidays', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'themes', 'badge', 'viewer', 'privy', 'holiday', 'traditions', 'observed', 'cultural', 'disconnection', 'may', 'be', 'tempting', 'first', 'film', 'manage', 'warm', 'up', 'familiar', 'themes', 'Christmas', 'season', 'Actually', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'curious', 'what', 'other', 'traditions', 'have', 'awhile', 'kind', 'wished', 'got', 'more', 'cultural', 'traditions', 'clich', 'eacute', 'familial', 'trappings', 'holiday', 'nothing', 'original', 'manner', 'things', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'movie', 'film', 'characters', 'have', 'baggages', 'carry', 'film', 'screenplay', 'back', 'forth', 'humor', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'was', 'couple', 'plot', 'elements', 'had', 'potential', 'subplots', 'Jesse', 'Ozzy', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'performers', 'vying', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'complications', 'revealed', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'can', 'get', 'irritating', 'how', 'many', 'things', 'can', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'limited', 'time', 'frame', 'do', 'airing', 'grievances', 'appear', 'be', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'occur', 'such', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'maybe', 'family', 'dinners', 'are', 'more', 'civilized', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'connect', 'grievances', 'Not', 'get', 'wrong', 'possible', 'guess', 'set', 'ups', 'were', 'little', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'move', 'stick', 'one', 'theme', 'De', 'Villa', 'viewers', 'pitching', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'then', 'leaving', 'half-baked', 'film', 'feels', 'rush', 'cover', 'too', 'much', 'ground', 'up', 'really', 'going', 'nowhere', 'significant.The', 'acting', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Elizabeth', 'Pena', 'are', 'very', 'charismatic', 'effective', 'heck', 'even', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'lone', 'Caucasian', 'woman', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'household', 'suppose', 'credit', 'needs', 'be', 'given', 'performers', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'Leguizamo', 'too', 'old', 'Pena', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'mother', '4', 'Years', 'apart', 'real', 'life', 'major', 'goof', 'part', 'direction', 'However', 'Pena', 'Molina', 'save', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'script', 'potential', 'divorce', 'subplot', 'two', 'manages', 'convince', 'situation', 'real', 'complaints', 'cast', 'do', 'manage', 'pull', 'off', 'carrying', 'most', 'film', 'burden', 'Nothing', 'Holidays', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'watch', 'times', 'feel', 'raw', 'talent', 'film', 'somewhat', 'wasted', 'manner', 'was', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'covered', 'too', 'much', 'ground', 'careful', 'development', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'issues', 'connecting', 'characters', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'endearing', 'have', 'lot', 'qualities', 'problem', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'breathe', 'direction', 'really', 'find', 'footing', 'Then', 'again', 'guess', 'may', 'be', 'way', 'households', 'Rental', '[', '2', '+Stars=', 'mediocre', 'fair', ']']",Nothing Like the Holidays
