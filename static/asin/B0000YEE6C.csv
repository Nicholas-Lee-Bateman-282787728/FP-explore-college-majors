788945,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B0000YEE6C,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 0]","Amazingly, I didn't hate this movie. This zombie movie is universally hated, and yet I'm one of the few who managed to extract value out of it for it's stupidity. I don't know, maybe I have an immunity to hating zombie movies. This movie is definitely no Resident Evil in terms of a quality movie-game, but I got a kick out of it. This plays out like a stupid parody of Day of the Dead, Resident Evil, 28 Days Later, The Matrix, some pirate movie, and a kung fu movie of some sort.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The story starts off with the character Rudy, telling of the hellish nightmare that happened on an island days earlier. It was Spring Break, and the college kids are going to a mysterious island to a party called the Rave of the Year. Five college kids miss the boat to the party and instead ask of the services of a fishing boat and pay $1000 for the captain to take them to the island, while having their boat pursued by a female cop named Casper who suspects the captain is smuggling items. The island is said to have a curse and is referred to as the Island of the Dead (Wait... this is supposed to be House of the Dead). When the kids get there they find it's completely deserted, and wander to find them (If you find ripped clothes with blood stains and the place is trashed, would you stay to investigate? Stupid people!). They find survivors hiding in a strange old house and team up with them, and their hellish nightmare (Or a comedy zombie adventure) begins when they figure out what's going on.MUSIC: I liked this movie's music, it was actually pretty good to listen to and it had some nice tunes to it as well.ACTION: This movie loaded with cheesyness in every possible aspect. Zombies that jump high, can do Matrix moves, and can do karate. They can also wield weapons like axes, maces, and more (Wait, where did they get all these weapons from?). I also love the fact during the shooting scenes it seems as if the characters seem to have unlimited ammo for a long period of time. Why is this movie loaded with so many slow-motion sequences? And why were there clips from the games inserted in here? It looks stupid. The gore felt a little hammed up and cheesy and it felt a bit unnatural. I also booed the fact that it really didn't show people being eaten, just zombies being killed. Not to mention, some of these zombies don't adhere to the zombie rules. If you get shot in the head or you're decapitated you're supposed to die. One last note during the swimming scenes: Did we learn nothing from Jaws?DIALOGUE: It felt as if maybe only one character; Rudy; tried to salvage his role in this movie. Everyone else is terrible at acting and it's quite funny when they try to be serious about someone dying. Overall the dialogue is mostly laughably bad.OVERALL: Most people out there hate this movie, a lot. If you have interest in this movie, only rent it, do not buy. But at least the quality felt better than Day of the Dead 2: Contagium.THE GOOD: The cheesyness and the music.THE BAD: The cheesyness.",3,A VERY STUPID MOVIE THAT MADE ME LAUGH  6.5 OUT OF 10,1228953600,"12 11, 2008",2008,3016,"['Amazingly', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'movie', 'zombie', 'movie', 'universally', 'hated', 'yet', ""'m"", 'one', 'few', 'who', 'managed', 'extract', 'value', 'stupidity', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'have', 'immunity', 'hating', 'zombie', 'movies', 'movie', 'definitely', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'terms', 'quality', 'movie-game', 'got', 'kick', 'out', 'stupid', 'parody', 'Day', 'Dead', 'Resident', 'Evil', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Matrix', 'pirate', 'movie', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'sort.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'story', 'character', 'Rudy', 'telling', 'hellish', 'nightmare', 'happened', 'island', 'days', 'earlier', 'was', 'Spring', 'Break', 'college', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'mysterious', 'island', 'party', 'called', 'Rave', 'Year', 'Five', 'college', 'kids', 'miss', 'boat', 'party', 'instead', 'ask', 'services', 'fishing', 'boat', 'pay', '1000', 'captain', 'take', 'island', 'having', 'boat', 'pursued', 'female', 'cop', 'named', 'Casper', 'who', 'captain', 'smuggling', 'items', 'island', 'said', 'have', 'curse', 'referred', 'Island', 'Dead', 'Wait', 'supposed', 'be', 'House', 'Dead', 'When', 'kids', 'get', 'there', 'find', 'completely', 'deserted', 'wander', 'find', 'find', 'ripped', 'clothes', 'blood', 'stains', 'place', 'trashed', 'would', 'stay', 'investigate', 'Stupid', 'people', 'find', 'survivors', 'hiding', 'strange', 'old', 'house', 'team', 'up', 'hellish', 'nightmare', 'comedy', 'zombie', 'adventure', 'when', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'liked', 'movie', 'music', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'listen', 'had', 'nice', 'tunes', 'well.ACTION', 'movie', 'loaded', 'cheesyness', 'possible', 'aspect', 'Zombies', 'jump', 'high', 'can', 'do', 'Matrix', 'moves', 'can', 'do', 'karate', 'can', 'also', 'wield', 'weapons', 'axes', 'maces', 'more', 'Wait', 'where', 'did', 'get', 'weapons', 'also', 'love', 'fact', 'shooting', 'scenes', 'characters', 'seem', 'have', 'unlimited', 'ammo', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'Why', 'movie', 'loaded', 'so', 'many', 'slow-motion', 'sequences', 'why', 'were', 'clips', 'games', 'inserted', 'here', 'stupid', 'gore', 'felt', 'little', 'hammed', 'up', 'cheesy', 'felt', 'bit', 'unnatural', 'also', 'booed', 'fact', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'people', 'being', 'eaten', 'just', 'zombies', 'being', 'killed', 'Not', 'mention', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'adhere', 'zombie', 'rules', 'get', 'shot', 'head', ""'re"", 'decapitated', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'die', 'One', 'last', 'note', 'swimming', 'scenes', 'Did', 'learn', 'nothing', 'Jaws', 'DIALOGUE', 'felt', 'maybe', 'only', 'one', 'character', 'Rudy', 'tried', 'salvage', 'role', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'else', 'terrible', 'acting', 'quite', 'funny', 'when', 'try', 'be', 'serious', 'someone', 'dying', 'dialogue', 'mostly', 'laughably', 'bad.OVERALL', 'Most', 'people', 'out', 'there', 'hate', 'movie', 'lot', 'have', 'interest', 'movie', 'only', 'rent', 'not', 'buy', 'least', 'quality', 'felt', 'better', 'Day', 'Dead', '2', 'Contagium.THE', 'GOOD', 'cheesyness', 'music.THE', 'BAD', 'cheesyness']",House Of The Dead

Where to start? This has to be the most flawed movie I have ever seen, and as a huge fan of zombie movies it gets me mad to see people comparing this to the works of Lucio Fulci and George Romero. How stupid can they get? It begins with a bunch of young friends going together to a party, that's held on an island, called Isle Del Morte, or something along those lines. Anyways they don't explain how the zombies were created, you may think they do when Kirk (the captain) tells them about the Spanish, but he actually doesn't say much. I am not going to go deep into the story because there isn't really a story, most of the movie is spent shooting zombies. Here are a list of amazingly wrong things in this movie:- The acting was horrible by most of the people in this film, a girl gets thrown up on and it looks like she is laughing.- When Kirk lights up a cig on his boat it is raining, but when the camera goes to the people on the island there is no rain. Amazing isn't it?- The first zombies encountered look like mole people.- The short video game sequences shown every 10 minutes is not only annoying but so out of place and stupid.- Most of the humans deaths are off screen and not shown to the viewer.- The zombies can move fast, which they sure as hell shouldn't be doing, they can whistle, and get this, they can spit acid and jump in huge leaps!!!- One idiot in the film uses his camcorder even though his life is in danger.- When Kirk was telling the story about the Spaniards they spoke English, I wonder how if the zombie that was killed on the ship didn't know English when it met with a human?- The police woman tells Greg to come with her to hunt down zombies, but when they appear she tells him to run away.- Extremely cheesy closeups of the zombies and Greg when they are chasing him.- Kirk brought a box full of automatic weapons, as if he knew what he was headed for. If he did why did he go on the island in the first place?- Everyone that is given a gun knows how to fire it perfectly and aim dead on even though they obviously didn't use guns before. Not only can they do that, but they know KARATE!!!- If the ship was in the water and they were armed with tons of weapons why didn't they try to make it to the ship?- Most of the zombies are not shot in the head, but they still die, how can you break the biggest rule of zombies???- The Matrix style camera angles are so annoying because they are used way too often in this movie, they literally do it every minute or so!!!!! How many times do we have to see the same thing???- One of the dumbest things in the movie, is during the huge fight scene, the zombies walk around, and even walk past the humans without looking at them or even touching them, they wait till the humans are done shooting up other zombies then they move towards them!! How unrealistic is that?- The techno music is annoying and does not fit in with this movie, it destroys the little ammount of atmosphere that the movie had.- The zombies move very fast during some parts and very slow during others.- The director uses lame ways to show breasts in this movie.- This movie has no suspense at all.- The captain was bitten by a zombie but didn't turn into one!- When one of the guys shoots a zombie attacking the female police officer, the bullet does not go through the head of the zombie, but in other scenes bullets would go through numerous zombies, what gives?- The female police officer dies immediately after having both leggs chopped off a little bit above the knees, but there are no vital organs in your legs, you would die from loss off blood, but definately not that fast.- There's a corpse in the room but these people still have time to makeout?This movie was horrible, I wasted alot of my time watching it, don't take the good reviews seriously, they obviously don't know what a good horror movie is, the onlything I liked about this film was some of the zombies, and some of the gore scenes, you won't find anything else. Anybody can make a film about just killing monsters the whole time, horror these days is getting more uncreative everytime around.

Griffiths ""Adrian""","[3, 4]","I can't beat about the bush, House of The Dead is terrible, you only have to look at all the negative reviews that already exist to realise how bad it is. Why on earth this film was &quot;based&quot; on the Sega game is beyond me, it bears no relation to the plot of that game at all. I have played House of the Dead and the action in the game is far better directed and presented than this movie. Basically, a bunch of teens arrive on an island where a music festival is taking place, only to find everyone dead and the place overrun with zombies. Thats it. There's no acting or character development to speak of, just a lot of fighting with cheap looking zombies. Some of the girls take their tops off. The teens then come across a stash of weapons and instantly transform into action heros with superhuman gun skills, after which a 45 minute gun battle against the undead ensues, all accompanied by screeching thrash music. The effects are cheap and unimpressive, and the logical flaws littering the movie will make you want to throw things at the screen. I don't mind a lack of realism if the movie has a tongue in cheek atmosphere, but there's no hint of a sense of humour here. If you are still awake by the end, you will get to see the explanation and twist (gasp!) ending, but I doubt that you will even care by this time.The only bits I enjoyed of the whole movie were the screen wipes which flashed actual footage from the game on screen (!).

I thought the first exposed breast was a 'gimme'.  The second, however, was too outrageous.  To see the lovely young topless female turn around and face ron howard's crazy ugly little brother and not even manage to flinch was an awe-inspiring moment in wretchedness for me.This movie is a tragedy.  If Rob Zombie would have had this budget, 'House Of 1000 Corpses' would have looked like 'Citizen Kane' compared to this movie.  The incongruous 'bullet time' shots that interrupt the fight scenes are, to say the least, confusing.  The video game clips seemingly inserted at random serve to only break the monotany provided by the actors.The only saving grace is that, in the beginning, no one seems to be able to even throw a punch, but by the halfway point, everyone somehow learns kung fu and becomes an expert with the firearm they happen to be holding at the moment.

Personally, I did not want to see this movie. I went with my father to see the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (last showing of the evening!) and it was filled up. I saw some other people choose to see House of the Dead instead after they saw it was filled up, including one elderly couple. Half of us left the movie theater the first thirty minutes, no joke, and from a fourth of the way filled movie theater, that's just pathetic.The acting was horrible, the script was laughable, the nude scenes were a sad attempt to get dirty old men and frat boys into the theater, the zombie makeup was pure comedy, the horror was nowhere, the obsessively played rap music where some kind of screeching sound or foreshadowing tune should have been played was revoluting.

I know it ain't gonna win an award for anything, except maybe the goriest movie to get an R in the past 10 years.  I thought that Freddy Vs. Jason was the goriest film in a long time, but this just put it to shame.  It's a horror movie people.  Horror movies are about the body count.  If you want something scary go see a thriller like Gothika.  If you're a wimp, go see the Ring.  This movie is based upon a game and that's why I give it 5 stars.  It had some cool action, with some great gore.  I hoped it would be bloody and I wasn't disappointed.  For anyone that says that the gore looks fake, that's 'cuz it is.  They can't exactly run around with real bullets killing extras left and right.  That's murder, like the reviews I've been reading.

A video game that has no story, no good voice acting, but excellent violence and gore.  For those saying that this movie sucks, probably weren't fans of the game or tried to take this movie seriously.  It's just a fun movie with very little plot, due to the lack of things they had to work with in the first place, and with what the game had that makes it so great, graphic, bloody violence.

Take some bratty Gen-Xers, throw them on an island for a stupid rave, have some zombies attack and what do you get?  Pure, unadulterated defecation.There's a little know fact about this flick:  the entire behind-the-camera crew was made up completely of six-year olds.  And these wunderkind pretty much deliver what you'd expect:  crap acting, a crap script, crap special effects(i just love seeing the jump pads that throw stuntmen actually on screen during the film).  This movie is so crappy, the only thing they didn't do was wipe feces on the camera lens.Also, the best line in the movie(and my personal favorite part of the entire flick)is at the end when the lame-o hero comes face-to-face with the king zombie.  It is probably the worst bit of dialogue ever filmed.  Here's more-or-less how it goes:LAME-O HERO:  Why do you want to be immortal?KING ZOMBIE:  So I can live forever.Doesn't the fact that the king zombie wants to be immortal make it pretty obvious that its because he wants to live forever?  Well apparently not to the lame-o hero or to the makers of this crapfest.  With stuff like this, how did this film not win an Oscar?  Pathetic.The only decent thing in the film is the long shootout during about the middlepoint of the film.  The regular crew must have taken the day off and some people that weren't mentally challenged came in and shot it.  Its actually a pretty good scene.  Too bad that it can't make up for the pure putridness of the rest of the film.'House Of The Dead' is a pure crapfest, directed by probably the crappiest director ever, Uwe Boll(check out his equally stinky 'Alone In The Dark' for confirmation of his unequaled crappiness).

A group of college kids go out to an island for a rave (sponsored by Sega, of all things), which is suddenly overwhelmed with zombies, forcing them to fight for their lives and walk around in slow motion.

You'll notice that this philosophy has nothing to do with GOOD special effects, or even effects used at the appropriate time. Perish forbid the actors exhibit any emotion, either. There's a scene where a girl is turned into a zombie, tries to eat her friends and gets her head blown off, and her BOYFRIEND'S emotionless reply is simply, ""what was that?""I'm not the sort of person who watches movies and thinks, ""I could have done better than that,"" but I felt that way about EVERY SINGLE PERSON associated with this film -- writers, actors, director, makeup artists, the guy who dropped off the vegetable tray on day four of shooting... the only thing I couldn't do is provide the sheer eye candy of Erica Durance.

I actually watched it that day and that night.  It was awesome!  It didn't play in any theatres in my state so I couldn't enjoy that experience.  The film is about a bunch of young college kids going to the rave of the year on an island named the Island of the Dead (of course after the translation from Spanish) and meet up with a bunch of blood thirsty zombies.  What follows is lots of gore, action, and some good nudity.  I love this movie and I'm gonna watch it again tonight.  I love all of the action and the gore.  I'm a gorehound, if you haven't guessed already.  This film should have done a lot better than what it did.  I'm hoping for a sequel soon.  I doubt it will happen, but I can always submit a script myself.  I don't understand why people didn't like this film so much.  What was wrong with it.

From the very beginning, when we get the flashback intro and the clunky ""exposition"" that introduces the poorly-drawn meat (whoops, characters), you can tell this movie is going to be something special.  All of that exposition at the beginning is ultimately useless, because our surly band of rich and superficial young adults turn into hardcore swordfighters and gunfighters at the end of the movie, capable of out-swording an immortal conquistador.Having missed the boat to the ""largest rave of the year,"" which appears to have had all of 40 extras in attendance, our spoiled youth bribe a decent actor to take them to the island where the rave is, while Clint Howard begs him not to.  I imagine Uwe Boll standing in front of Jurgen Prochnow with a stack of Benjamins doing the exact same thing, while Jurgen's agent desperately tries to stop him.Upon arriving at the island, zombies attack.  OK, that's cool, because who doesn't like zombies?  Of course, Boll makes the key mistake of reminding us of other, better movies during his film.  (Don't do that again, Uwe!)  Oops, the island is home to an immortal Spanish conquistador who makes zombies.  There's some fighting, some bad dialogue, some questionable decision making by the only law enforcement person to show up, and massive overuse of bullet time.At the end, we get overdosed on bullet time and on the spinning Cam of Vomit, which makes you a little queasy while at the same time providing no visual information or interest whatsoever.  There's some kung fu, some swordfighting, and some Monty Python-eqsue Black Knight type fighting.  I don't think we were supposed to be laughing when the headless guy's body starts attacking our heros, but it's darn funny.Then, inexplicably, some FBI types show up on a chopper, do nothing, and we get a voiceover musing if this is the end, or (dum dum DUM) ""just the beginning""!Criswell and Tor Johnson would have been right at home in this mess.

Most of us look back on Ed Wood as one of the very worst directors who ever stepped behind a camera. Right now, I would have to say that Uwe Boll makes Wood look like Steven Spielberg!

How that happened is a mystery that will probably plague me for the rest of my natural life. I cannot begin to speculate how I would have reacted after paying my hard earned money to see this junk in a theater. Renting it free from the video store I used to work at was bad enough, because I still lost 90 minutes of my life that I'm never going to have again!Somebody needs to put Boll in a paper bag and ship him away somewhere! He has no passion for what he does, no common sense, and he very obviously takes the vast majority of us fans out there for fools! To hear him prattle on about this movie in the special features portion of the DVD, you would think he had just filmed the second coming of Christ! He is delusional and clearly needs to seek professional help if he seriously believes this happy-horse-dung was, in any way, entertaining.This had no business being made, bottom line, and is a total slap in the face to anybody--like me--who considers themselves horror fans.

Tons of boobs and blood, acting that ranges from average to ""I'm reading this off a cue card"", a story that was vaguely interesting, and a script that was crap, but not much worse than the average zombie flick.  The truly  hilarious part is the camera work and editing - it's as if someone let a group of hyperactive kindergartners loose in a room full of professional editing equipment, and five days later, this is the result.  Every camera gimmick you saw in the Matrix is repeated here, over and over, and over and over, and over and over again.  And then it's repeated a bunch more times.  For some reason, there's a flashback sequence in the middle of the movie where the last 30 minutes is run again in about 30 seconds.  Why?  Because Ewe Boll forgot he was making a movie and though he was working on an MTV video.  There are also hundreds of quick video game shots thrown in at random intervals.  They're actually kind of amusing.  This film could have been improved by removing about 3,000 edits from the final product, but did I mention it was edited by a group of hyperactive kindergartners flying on sugar and caffeine?If you can laugh at the fact that the camera gimmicks completely overshadow the story on several occasions, this is actually an enjoyable film.

One of the stars I gave is for the good looking cast, unfortunately they can't act at all.

I was so confused at first, because I swear I was watching J&uuml;rgen Prochnow one of the greatest German actors trading lines with the king of all cheesy cameos, Opie Cunningham's brother, Clint Howard!! My eyes weren't deceiving me, it was J&uuml;rgen he must have really bumped his head on the door of his submarine to be coaxed into doing this. The whole premise behind this trash heap was a rave that takes place on an island ""isle de los mort"" which I am pretty sure has dinosaurs on it, anyway, all these ""kids"" who looked suspiciously in their late late 20's, converge on the island to drink beer and dance (although I have never seen a ""rave"" that looked like that in my life). When I saw the Asian chick in the stars and stripes I thought that ""Fook me"" from Austin powers had made a cameo. During the rave Zombies come and massacre the whole lot, therefore creating more zombies I guess. All I knew was that there were about 3 sets of boobs (one set of which had the smallest nips I have ever seen in my life), and it seemed the zombies all shared the same baldheaded mask that I saw on sale during the post Halloween sale at Spencer's .It was obvious the budget was akin to maybe a UPN or even a bad VH1 spoof commercial. There was no point to this movie at all, the plot? A Spaniard mad scientist who wanted to live forever, he created a virus? Potion? New sports drink? To reanimate corpses to keep him company in that haunted pirate house? Throughout the whole movie was flashes from the video game which was completely unnecessary. The major giant fight scene between the zombies and the remaining kids plus captain J&uuml;rgen and Casper the friendly cop, lasted about 25 minutes I swear. The director had a brainstorm that sounded something like this ""lets take each person, with their weapon, set up cameras matrix style and slow mo them shooting zombies, that way we can extend the movie about 25 minutes and use up all the money meant for the effects makeup because who needs that?"" And in the end? The bad guy, Mr. FrankenScarface Spaniard dies because someone chops off his head and squishes it, now why didn't anyone think of that when they were trying to kill him centuries ago? Please don't waste your time on this movie, please don't think it's a horror movie, or a zombie movie, or a teen comedy, or a fun thriller ,its none of those things. And J&uuml;rgen?

788974,A78UK4PFXMLH4,B0000YEE6C,Christian Hokenson,"[20, 25]","Folks, save yourselves from ""House of the Dead."" This is pretty atrocious filmmaking at its most insulting.  Worse than even ""Resident Evil.""  I know, I know... they are just videogames, not a movies (but if you check out the special features junk on the ""House of the Dead"" DVD you can find out the filmmakers had a much different, and much higher opinion of their effort).""House of the Dead"" offers lots of action but, as usual for today's young auteurs weened on MTV, it's pretty damn hard to follow and, after a while, it becomes repetitious to the point of sheer boredom.  The acting is rotten (save for Jurgen Prochnow (it's a long way from Das Boot, ain't it captain) and the ever weird, always interesting Clint Howard (it's a long way from ""Evilspeak"" isn't it Coopersmith)), the special effects are decent (when you can see them, and hey... ALL special effects should be decent nowadays, shouldn't they... no points there).  The direction is nearly non-existent, and the screenwriting is simply bad... but not bad in a fun way-- the way you can play drinking games with a movie or MST3K it to death on a Friday night around the hookah.  I can't even really bring myself to call this a horror film, for not once was I horrified save for the moment, toward the end, where I thought to myself, ""y'know, you've actually wasted nearly two hours of your life on this inglorious piece of poop, man.""This ""film"" has the temerity to namecheck George A. Romero and his (as one character aptly puts it) ""Holy Trilogy"" of zombie classics: ""Night, Dawn and Day"" natch.  Well, 'tis true.. Romero is clearly sui generis when it comes to apocalyptic zombie horror.  No need to run (as the current spate of zombies is wont to do), for there's nowhere to hide.  Romero at the very, very least has an understanding of the basic rules of filmmaking that at least keep a viewer's interests alive for his dead folks... not only that, but he clearly understands the most basic rules of drama and character.  I know many folks that didn't grow up with Romero's films might look at them with some derision regarding black n' white zombies in ""Night of the Living Dead"" or the baby-blue flesh and Crayola day-glow colors of blood from ""Dawn of the Dead.""  Yet, Romero knew how to handle the gory violence in his films (over-the-top and with great shock-value) and, in the end, Romero wasn't simply striving for realism in gore so much as he was trying to make a valid (still valid!) point about how human beings act in a society under severe stress. He had something to SAY, and he was able to SHOW it without lots of lame-assed exposition that passes for dialogue these days.Uwe Boll on the other hand, knows at least how to load a camera and keep it running (and running and running and running).  But he has no sense of story whatsoever, no sense of pace, no sense of continuity and no sense of fun.  This is a dreary exercise in crap filmmaking with a decent-sized budget... the kind of budget Romero should have had for his underrated films, but hey! at least Romero knows how to use a dollar wisely.  Boll seems to be a kid on the ultimate sugar high as he spends money on fancy camera angles, weird point-of-view shots, CGI gore, and buffed out stuntpeople as decayed corpses... and yes, I know this movie is really just a videogame.  In fact, the ""director"" even goes so far as to include shots from that videogame as segues to his badly choreographed action sequences.  After the first few heads a-poppin' (yay, for gun violence) it gets rather dull, and then the action speeds up even more in order to keep the audience awake and, well, just plain confused from what I could see.  Boll hits all the cliches just right... POV of the bullet going into flesh and inanimate objects, bullet-time cinematography (can someone please put a stake in the heart of this visual stunt once and for all?!?) and of course some good-lookin' young adults with sawdust for brains and the martial arts skill of Bruce Lee flippin' the bird to the laws of physics.  It's inane, it's astonishingly lame and it's insulting to sit through, and yet I did, just so you can avoid having to sit through it too!One thing about George A. Romero and his highly regarded trilogy of zombie films: the zombies themselves were often secondary to the living human characters they sought to munch on.  They were scary because you could clearly see they were no longer reasonable human beings-- your family, your friends-- but just dead things with a devastating single-minded instinct for moving foward toward a hot lunch. It didn't matter if they ran or did Cirque d'Soleil-style acrobatics in order to get to you, or just simply lurched.  The zombies were always a wave of nearly unstoppable slowness, and thus a very handy metaphor for everything from groupthink to mall shoppers on a Sunday afternoon.  In ""House of the Dead"" the zombies are just fodder, nothing but magnets for lead projectiles... and yes, I know, it's just a videogame.In the end, avoid this load of manure and check out Romero's films if you haven't yet (and, really, what self-respecting zombie fan has not seen them yet?!?).  If you can't handle character building, drama and a fairly amazing story of the breakdown of society due to lack of cooperation among the living (and, yes, plenty of gore), then I say turn to either ""Re-Animator"" or, better yet, ""Return of the Living Dead"" which at least also manages to tell a story and offer up some halfway decent acting with he gore. Both of those films also offer copious amounts of nudity for you teenage horror fans who seemingly can't get close to the real thing... and yes, I know the videogame movie does too, but the other movies have the added benefit of actual skilled filmmakers behind the scenes, while ""House of the Dead"" does not.  ""Return of the Living Dead"" actually gives the horror fan a shining example of what ""House of the Dead"" could have been in the right hands.  One film is loads of fun (and hey, by the way, Romero's films offer fun and humor in spades lest you think they are simply turgid sociological dissertations), and the other is so much less than fun it could lead to suicide.  I know I wanted to off myself just for getting through to the credits.The films of Romero along with Peter Jackson's brilliant, low-budget ""Braindead/Dead Alive,"" and the recent releases of ""28 Days Later"" (a quasi-zombiefest) and the hilarious (and quite bloody) ""Shaun of the Dead"" all offer far more entertainment value (key words here, folks) than ""House of the Dead.""  These films all have some quirky things to say about life along with loads of furious bloodletting, while ""House of the Dead"" is simply a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.",1,"Bad, but not

788976,A1BAU33PV3HMK7,B0000YEE6C,Cobalt,"[0, 0]","Uwe Boll has been called one of the worst directors on the face of the earth by pretty much everyone.  This movie is the absolute rock bottom of his entire career.  It's so abhorrantly bad in every way, shape, and form.  The acting sucks, the camera work is sloppy, there's pointless sexual content, and segments from the actual House Of The Dead game are spliced into the movie, when it has no relation whatsoever to the plot.  Uwe Boll has single-handedly made Michael Bay look like Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsece.  I'd rather watch Bad Boys, Transformers, The Island, The Rock, and even Pearl Harbor if it meant I never had to watch this steaming pile of dog excrement again.Basically, the plot of the HOTD movie (which, again, does not have anything to do with the actual game) is about this group of kids that want to go to the ""Rave of the Century.""  They give $1,000 to the captain of a fishing boat to take them there.  When they arrive, they discover the rave sight is destroyed and there's blood everywhere.  As they're investigating, zombies appear out of nowhere, they find an actual house that's much bigger on the inside than the outside, and they stumble upon some ancient prophecy.If a movie has crappy acting and a crappy story, but well-done action scenes, then it could possibly qualify as a guilty pleasure.  The movie title alone guarantees that it's not going to be deep in any way.  However, the greatest sin this movie commits is completely tarnishing the action scenes with ameteurish, cheesy, garbage camera tricks and spliced-in footage of the actual HOTD video game.  The worst example of this is in the middle of the movie, where there's a long extended gunfight between the survivors and the zombies.  Slo-mo is way, way too overused, and then the camera will even freeze time and then pan 360 degrees around the scene before everything resumes again.  In the middle of all this, the video game footage flashes in and out like a subliminal message, laughing at you because you wasted your money on this s***ty movie.The final battle against the zombie's immortal leader is just as bad.  The leader stabs one of the last two survivors, but gets his head cut off.  However, he's still alive!  As he starts choking the other guy to death, the girl gets up, limps over to the severed head, and squashes it with her foot.  Then the leader actually dies.  I was cursing out loud at the movie at that point, but then what angered me even more was that it tried to relate itself directly to the video game, as well as a real zombie movie like George Romero's pictures.  It doesn't even deserve to be compared to the Resident Evil series, let alone the Father of the zombie genre!This movie proves that Uwe Boll is quite possibly the worst director alive.  Video-game-based movies has traditionally been a slippery genre, but Boll takes it and just mashes the genre into a bunch of massive, bloody chunks.  This movie is the ultimate rock bottom for filmmaking in general.  It has no redeemable qualities and is not even a guilty pleasure.  All copies of this movie should be destroyed, never to be recovered again.",1,The absolute worst movie that is based on a video game ever made!,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,3142,"['Uwe', 'Boll', 'been', 'called', 'one', 'worst', 'directors', 'face', 'earth', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'movie', 'absolute', 'rock', 'bottom', 'entire', 'career', 'so', 'abhorrantly', 'bad', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'acting', 'sucks', 'camera', 'work', 'sloppy', 'pointless', 'sexual', 'content', 'segments', 'actual', 'House', 'Dead', 'game', 'are', 'spliced', 'movie', 'when', 'relation', 'whatsoever', 'plot', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'single-handedly', 'made', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'look', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Martin', 'Scorsece', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'Transformers', 'Island', 'Rock', 'even', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'meant', 'never', 'had', 'watch', 'steaming', 'pile', 'dog', 'excrement', 'again.Basically', 'plot', 'HOTD', 'movie', 'again', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'actual', 'game', 'group', 'kids', 'want', 'go', 'Rave', 'Century', 'give', '1,000', 'captain', 'fishing', 'boat', 'take', 'there', 'When', 'arrive', 'discover', 'rave', 'sight', 'destroyed', 'blood', 'everywhere', ""'re"", 'investigating', 'zombies', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'find', 'actual', 'house', 'much', 'bigger', 'inside', 'outside', 'stumble', 'ancient', 'prophecy.If', 'movie', 'crappy', 'acting', 'crappy', 'story', 'well-done', 'action', 'scenes', 'then', 'could', 'possibly', 'qualify', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'movie', 'title', 'alone', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'deep', 'way', 'However', 'greatest', 'sin', 'movie', 'completely', 'tarnishing', 'action', 'scenes', 'ameteurish', 'cheesy', 'garbage', 'camera', 'tricks', 'spliced-in', 'footage', 'actual', 'HOTD', 'video', 'game', 'worst', 'example', 'middle', 'movie', 'where', 'long', 'extended', 'gunfight', 'survivors', 'zombies', 'Slo-mo', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'overused', 'then', 'camera', 'will', 'even', 'freeze', 'time', 'then', 'pan', '360', 'degrees', 'scene', 'everything', 'resumes', 'again', 'middle', 'video', 'game', 'footage', 'flashes', 'subliminal', 'message', 'laughing', 'wasted', 'money', 's***ty', 'final', 'battle', 'zombie', 'immortal', 'leader', 'just', 'bad', 'leader', 'stabs', 'one', 'last', 'two', 'survivors', 'head', 'cut', 'off', 'However', 'still', 'alive', 'choking', 'other', 'guy', 'death', 'girl', 'up', 'limps', 'severed', 'head', 'foot', 'Then', 'leader', 'actually', 'was', 'cursing', 'out', 'loud', 'movie', 'point', 'then', 'what', 'angered', 'even', 'more', 'was', 'tried', 'relate', 'directly', 'video', 'game', 'as', 'well', 'real', 'zombie', 'movie', 'George', 'Romero', 'pictures', ""n't"", 'even', 'deserve', 'be', 'compared', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'series', 'let', 'alone', 'Father', 'zombie', 'genre', 'movie', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'quite', 'possibly', 'worst', 'director', 'alive', 'Video-game-based', 'movies', 'traditionally', 'been', 'slippery', 'genre', 'Boll', 'just', 'mashes', 'genre', 'bunch', 'massive', 'bloody', 'chunks', 'movie', 'ultimate', 'rock', 'bottom', 'filmmaking', 'general', 'redeemable', 'qualities', 'not', 'even', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'copies', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'destroyed', 'never', 'be', 'recovered', 'again']",House Of The Dead

788978,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B0000YEE6C,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[7, 9]","There are things in our world that were never meant for human eyes to behold nor human mind to fathom:---the tentacled, slumbering horror that is Mighty Cthulhu, imprisoned dreaming beneath the sunken city of R'lyeh, sending nightmares of horror, madness and death to mortal men!---the fearsome mutilations carried out by the Yeti-men of Yuzulak in the frozen reaches of Siberia!---the gigantic, slobbering, galactically brilliant and monumentally psychotic denizens of the Martian canals, eternally crafting their tripod death machines and bent on ruling Earth!---anything filmed by Teutonic Madman Herr Doktor Uwe Boll, who gave the world ""House of the Dead"", cinema's answer to Pol Pot!First off, you've got to know something about the fiendish Herr Doktor Boll, so you can appreciate what you're in for. In a saner, God-fearing age, Uwe Boll would be quickly hauled before an Inquisitorial Tribunal, convicted of being a tool of the Evil One, and burned at the stake. In 21st century America, producers throw money at him to make movies like ""House of the Dead"" (and now ""Alone in the Dark"").Smuggled out of Nazi Germany during the last days of the Third Reich, shipped to Argentina with a directive to obliterate Allied filmmaking as we know it, bankrolled by a trove of secret Nazi gold, Uwe Boll owns rights to every single videogame ever made (""Far Cry"", ""Hunter: the Reckoning"", ""Bloodrayne""---everything, kids, I'm sorry---Boll owns the rights to all of `em), and intends to make a movie out of every last one of them. A bad movie. A godawful movie that will make God in his Heaven cry, that may, in fact, even rip open a gate to Hell. A Legion of bad movies that look, sound, smell and taste like a**.First understand this: ""House of the Dead"" (hereafter referred to as HoTD) is a cinematic cat turd, tossed in a blender, pureed, stuck in a microwave, and served to you, Gentle Viewer, piping hot, straight from Chef Boll's kitchen! Bon appetit!HoTD dumps the following into the cauldron: a boatload of stupid (but nubile) teens; a super-secret island rave; a raving 19th century pirate, mad scientist, and flesh-eating liche big into gene-splicing; a horde of running and hopping flesh eating zombies; and a big Undead Tuff Shed. Seriously, the ""House"" is a shed. Only the greediest, most feverishly optimistic real estate agent would describe it as a House.No matter. Teens get a ride to the island rave by way paying a wad of cash to Captain Victor Kirk (Captain Kirk---get it? get it?---played stoically to the end by Jurgen Prochnow) and his sidekick Salish (played horrifically by the Ice Cream Man himself, Clint Howard).From there it's by the numbers: 1) Teens find rave deserted, 2)Teens split up, 3)Teens meet Zombies, 4) Teens get eaten and pooped out; 5) Surviving Teens turn into wire-fu machine-gun toting killing Machines.The acting is uniformly awful, and comes in two flavors: 1) Good Sport 2)Bad Sport. Good Sport:The raver kids (Ona Grauer and Jon Cherry come to mind, since most of the raver kid actors just blend together) do what they have to do: spew projectile vomit that passes as HoTD's ""dialogue"", smooch while hordes of flesh-rending zombies close in---one kid worries about his good looks even as the zombies tear through the walls hankering for flesh.Jurgen Prochnow is HoTD's Uber-Good Sport: he takes those zombies down with extreme prejudice and cigar-chomping dedication, courtesy of his laser-sighted assault rifle, spits out terse little quips, and smokes Cuban cigars furiously, all while tending to his zombie ravaged leg. Like Val Kilmer in the equally horrific ""Island of Dr. Moreau"", Jurgen, it seems, has had an epiphany---there's no way outta this thing, so might as well enjoy myself. And hey---the check cleared.On the Bad Sport side, we had the two 'veteran' actors: Howard and Elie Cornell, who phone their performances in. Howard is so bad you're thrilled to see him die, but Cornell eventually grew on me, brutal death and all.It takes true wicked genius, a strain of deranged brilliance, to make a movie as genuinely, astonishingly, consistently awful as HoTD. Boll doesn't just hobble his flick with incompetent acting, a brain-damaged script, and incoherent editing---oh no. At the very height of his action sequences, just when the movie is attempting to get some traction and draw the audience in, the rare seconds when HoTD actually works, Boll grafts in screen shots from the ""House of the Dead"" videogame.No---really. Better still, pixellated screenshots. At the height of the action sequences.Now, understand this: I *bought* the DVD for House of the Dead, having seen it---under the influence of much firewater---in the movie theater. Why? Because it takes iron nads to make a flick that s*cks this bad. Because in the nasty, brutal, merciless Desert of the Real, I don't get many laughs---and I hooted like a fool while watching HoTD. Because we don't have enough funny, and HoTD---whether Herr Doktor Boll intended it to be or not---is funny. No, really---it stinks so bad, so hard, so monstrously, that it's divinely hysterical.Is it a nasty 100-car-pileup of a bad flick? Absolutely.

I missed alot of lines in the movie due to laughter. about the first 20 minutes its an absolute riot, but immediatly after that you are laughed out, and you really get a chance to see how bad it is. i couldn't help but notice that actual scenes from the arcade game pop on the screen randomly, no warning, no reason, just bam, there and gone. there was one great scene when a guy got flipped in a port-o-potty, that was funny. the acting in this movie is definitly noteworthy. i'm sure everyone will hear of these actors and actresses eventually when they truely get discovered for their talents, you may see them in your town, directing your children, in the elementary school production of the wizard of oz. what a brief acting carrer these youngsters had, and none of them can say they went out with a bang, all they can say is, &quot;yeah, i made about 500 bucks to be in house of the dead, i was the star, now i work as a lifeguard at a lake in north dakota.&quot; i can say though, a friend rented this movie, brought it over, we watched about 32 minutes worth, stopped it and returned it immediatly, he probably couldn't drive fast enough to get it back there, before the oder of the dvd started to fill his car. i think we will be seeing the entire cast at the academy awards next year, they must've missed them this last time around, i am of course speaking about the makeup for this poor excuse of a movie. really made you scared didn't it. oh yeah, and whats the guys problem, at the begining, a nude broad rips into the water, but he wouldn't join her. if you ask me, he was probably &quot;tieing his shoes&quot; right when he got attacked, probably moaned too. but back to the makeup. the makeup (done by the american school of the blind and untalented) was nothing short of awful, not scarry, not cool, nothing. but the wardrobe, the wardrobe my friends, is also awful. the acting, you guessed it, awful. the script, the directing, the casting, the editing, all fantastic. thats what saved this movie, the directing. woooh. i can't wait until the next video game movie comes out, last i heard it was going to be tetris the movie, with music by raisin hill. you are all welcome.",1,Worse than Ax 'Em,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,2600,"['least', 'bad', 'Boy', 'movie', 'gem', 'suppose', 'everyone', 'should', ""'ve"", 'known', 'when', 'menu', 'screen', 'actually', 'Insert', 'Coins', 'am', 'willing', 'bet', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone', 'next', 'comment', 'When', 'group', 'dingles', 'approach', 'boat', 'begining', 'movie', 'mongoloid', 'flying', 'corner', 'speaking', ""'d"", 'been', 'trapped', '37', 'tons', 'fecies', 'last', '8', 'years', 'was', 'hilarious', 'missed', 'alot', 'lines', 'movie', 'due', 'laughter', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'absolute', 'riot', 'immediatly', 'are', 'laughed', 'out', 'really', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'how', 'bad', 'i', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'actual', 'scenes', 'arcade', 'game', 'pop', 'screen', 'randomly', 'warning', 'reason', 'just', 'bam', 'gone', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'scene', 'when', 'guy', 'got', 'flipped', 'port-o-potty', 'was', 'funny', 'acting', 'movie', 'definitly', 'noteworthy', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'everyone', 'will', 'hear', 'actors', 'actresses', 'eventually', 'when', 'truely', 'get', 'discovered', 'talents', 'may', 'see', 'town', 'directing', 'children', 'elementary', 'school', 'production', 'wizard', 'oz', 'what', 'brief', 'acting', 'carrer', 'youngsters', 'had', 'none', 'can', 'say', 'went', 'out', 'bang', 'can', 'say', 'quot', 'i', 'made', '500', 'bucks', 'be', 'house', 'dead', 'i', 'was', 'star', 'now', 'i', 'work', 'lifeguard', 'lake', 'north', 'dakota.', 'quot', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'friend', 'rented', 'movie', 'brought', 'over', 'watched', '32', 'minutes', 'worth', 'stopped', 'returned', 'immediatly', 'probably', 'could', ""n't"", 'drive', 'fast', 'enough', 'get', 'back', 'there', 'oder', 'dvd', 'started', 'fill', 'car', 'i', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'entire', 'cast', 'academy', 'awards', 'year', 'must', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'last', 'time', 'i', 'am', 'course', 'speaking', 'makeup', 'poor', 'excuse', 'movie', 'really', 'made', 'scared', 'did', ""n't"", 'oh', 'yeah', 'guys', 'problem', 'begining', 'nude', 'broad', 'rips', 'water', 'would', ""n't"", 'join', 'ask', 'was', 'probably', 'quot', 'tieing', 'shoes', 'quot', 'right', 'when', 'got', 'attacked', 'probably', 'moaned', 'too', 'back', 'makeup', 'makeup', 'done', 'american', 'school', 'blind', 'untalented', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'awful', 'not', 'scarry', 'not', 'cool', 'nothing', 'wardrobe', 'wardrobe', 'friends', 'also', 'awful', 'acting', 'guessed', 'awful', 'script', 'directing', 'casting', 'editing', 'fantastic', 'thats', 'what', 'saved', 'movie', 'directing', 'woooh', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'out', 'last', 'i', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'tetris', 'movie', 'music', 'raisin', 'hill', 'are', 'welcome']",House Of The Dead
788982,A24SC3EXWOIK2P,B0000YEE6C,"Dead Kev ""Zombie Advocate""","[0, 0]","Five college students take an ill-fated trip to a remote island, endearingly called ""Isla del Muerte"". That's ""Island of the Dead"" for you non-Spanish speakers. They're expecting to take in a rave, but they get oh so much more than that. There be zombies on that thar island! That's about all the setup that you need, sadly it's not any more elaborate than that. And sadly, such a simple concept is convoluted by the fact that it's told as one big flashback with a bunch of flashbacks scattered throughout.I was completely disappointed by the garbage script that was churned out. Completely abysmal. I wouldn't have been as disgruntled if I hadn't seen the writers' other work. I thought that Dave Parker's THE DEAD HATE THE LIVING was a much more inspired effort, and Mark Altman's screenplay of FREE ENTERPRISE was complete genius compared to this tripe. Some of the lines are complete head-shakers. Much like the boat captain's name, Captain ""Kirk"" (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow), the movie seems like it wants to be tongue-in-cheek, but Boll directs it completely straight. That's where it all unravels.The action sequences would have been a positive for the film, but alas, Uwe Boll drops the ball again. If I see another bullet-time action sequence, it'll be too soon. The way it's callously thrown around, you'd think that Boll was the creator of the effect and this is the first time it's ever been seen or something. The main battle between humans and zombies is ruined by the insertion of distracting video game shots (which appear throughout the whole film) and the far too generous dose of slow-motion bullet-time. Every single character is granted a useless 360 degree slow-mo shot of them shooting off their weapon. It makes the transition from ""ridiculous"" to ""completely ridiculous"" when Rudy (Jonathan Cherry) takes a moment, in the middle of the carnage, to reflect on the events so far. The flashback is simply a super-fast collage of clips from the movie up to that point. I don't know about you, but the last thing that I'd do in the middle of a battle for my life would be to take time out to think about things. Utterly pointless and insulting. It's like we needed a refresher because we hadn't remembered what we've seen in the last 30 minutes.This film should have never made it into the theaters, plain and simple. There's nothing redeemable, nothing original, nothing even fun. I can imagine Uwe Boll thinks he's very clever and his use of all the flashbacks was creative...it wasn't. He probably thinks his action scenes were mind-blowing with all the slow-mo and his camera tricks...they weren't. He, for some odd reason, thinks he can actually direct. He can't.",1,Stay Away...Far Away.

Specifically, he pushes the boundaries of just how wretched a movie can be, and makes viewers ask, ""Why is this guy allowed anywhere near a camera?""""House of the Dead"" is the perfect example of this, as the first of Boll's still-going stream of video-game adaptations. Put simply, this movie is a perfect example of everything that is wrong in video-game adaptations, zombie movies, and trashy action movies in general.A gang of twentysomethings are planning the Rave of the Century, and for some inexplicable reason, they decide to have it on a remote island called the Island of the Dead (ooh, foreshadowing! Subtle!). The boatman warns a gathering of eight young people that they are all utterly doomed, but when they show him the money, he takes them anyway.But when they get to the rave site, they find that someone has wrecked it and is presumably lurking nearby -- and they find a mysterious house in the woods. Of course, they go inside. And then they are attacked by hordes of zombies, who are at the beck and call of an evil creature living in the House of the Dead -- an immortal conquistador. (Oooookaaayyyy....)No, it doesn't make sense, and it never STARTS making sense. You know a movie is doomed when it doesn't make sense from the get-go. Why would they host a rave at a campsite... on a remote island... with only a few people? That's pretty brainless, even for a low-rent game-adaptation/zombie flick. But sadly, the illogic isn't the worst thing about it. Boll is.To be honest, Boll could not have made a worse movie if he had tried. He inserts bits of the video game, seemingly at random, and tries to make up for the limp plot with lots of Matrixy slow-motion and spinning camerawork. If that doesn't make you sick to your stomach, the dialogue will: ""You did all this to become immortal. Why?"" ""To live forever!""And the action scenes are the worst -- not a single fight looks real, and the zombies are distinctly unscary. At times it reminded me of King Arthur's fight with the dismembered, blood-spurty black knight... except Boll is utterly serious.

788992,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B0000YEE6C,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[0, 3]","A few weeks ago I declared &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; the worst movie of 2003, and then I saw &quot;House of the Dead.&quot; This is was most pointless, stupidest, and dumbest movie I have ever seen, even before 2003. The biggest problem with the movie was that you didn't care about any of the characters. The point of the characters was to die, and not for you to hope they don't die, or for you to relate to. That usually happens in most horror movies, but some work. This was just a compliation of scenes where you just want the movie to end. &quot;House of the Dead&quot; is based on the video game by the same name. I have played the video game, and I don't think its that bad. It a first person game with plastic guns, and you shoot the dead bad guns using the guns. The game is fun and although it lacks on story, it exceeds on the thrill of making sure that you don't die. But in the movie, you just don't care.You know that just about all the characters die, because in the beginning of the movie the character Greg says that just about all the characters die. You can't even guess which characters survive because of this. After that we see earlier that Greg, Cynthia, Simon, Karma, and Alicia are trying to get to a rave party on an island. They miss there boat and pay Captain Kirk to bring them to the island. Kirk's first mate Salish is not thrilled about going to that island, because the name of it translates into the Island of Death. They don't care, but are almost in trouble when the coast guard Casper chases after Kirk, because she wonders about what he is carrying in his boat. Kirk brings them to the island and then sends Salish to try and get rid of his cargo before Casper can catch up to them. The kids then find that the party is deserted. Soon they find out that these zombie creatures found the party and killed everybody there. Most of the kids think that it is just a pratical joke as part of the rave, but they find out that the dead walk the island. They meet humans like Liberty and Rudy, and with the help of Kirk and Casper they try to stay alive.&quot;House of the Dead&quot; was just plain terrible. The character of Salish is played by Clint Howard, the brother of Ron Howard, who is a good actor and has been in over a hundred movies. You wonder to yourself how such a good actor could be in a movie this bad. Usually I like movies that are pointless, but this movie was a movie where you know what happens, you can't care about the characters because none have the qualities of a hero. A final point that I am going to make is how the director inserted action from the video game. It was ok during the opening credits. It wasn't a clever idea and it got annoying after a long time. The movie also has clear rip-offs of the Matrix. How about an orignal horror movie next time. I didn't like it, but you might.ENJOY!Rated R for pervasive strong violence/gore, language and some nudity.",1,The Worst Film of 2003!,1075420800,"01 30, 2004",2004,2926,"['few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'declared', 'quot', 'A', 'Mighty', 'Wind', 'quot', 'worst', 'movie', '2003', 'then', 'saw', 'quot', 'House', 'Dead.', 'quot', 'was', 'most', 'pointless', 'stupidest', 'dumbest', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'even', '2003', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'point', 'characters', 'was', 'die', 'not', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'die', 'relate', 'usually', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'work', 'was', 'just', 'compliation', 'scenes', 'where', 'just', 'want', 'movie', 'end', 'quot', 'House', 'Dead', 'quot', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'same', 'name', 'have', 'played', 'video', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'first', 'person', 'game', 'plastic', 'guns', 'shoot', 'dead', 'bad', 'guns', 'using', 'guns', 'game', 'fun', 'story', 'thrill', 'making', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'die', 'movie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care.You', 'know', 'just', 'characters', 'die', 'beginning', 'movie', 'character', 'Greg', 'just', 'characters', 'die', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'guess', 'characters', 'survive', 'see', 'earlier', 'Greg', 'Cynthia', 'Simon', 'Karma', 'Alicia', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'rave', 'party', 'island', 'miss', 'there', 'boat', 'pay', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'bring', 'island', 'Kirk', 'first', 'mate', 'Salish', 'not', 'thrilled', 'about', 'going', 'island', 'name', 'Island', 'Death', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'are', 'almost', 'trouble', 'when', 'coast', 'guard', 'Casper', 'Kirk', 'what', 'carrying', 'boat', 'Kirk', 'island', 'then', 'Salish', 'try', 'get', 'rid', 'cargo', 'Casper', 'can', 'catch', 'up', 'kids', 'then', 'find', 'party', 'deserted', 'Soon', 'find', 'out', 'zombie', 'found', 'party', 'killed', 'everybody', 'there', 'Most', 'kids', 'think', 'just', 'pratical', 'joke', 'part', 'rave', 'find', 'out', 'dead', 'walk', 'island', 'meet', 'humans', 'Liberty', 'Rudy', 'help', 'Kirk', 'Casper', 'try', 'stay', 'alive.', 'quot', 'House', 'Dead', 'quot', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'terrible', 'character', 'Salish', 'played', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'brother', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'who', 'good', 'actor', 'been', 'hundred', 'movies', 'wonder', 'yourself', 'how', 'such', 'good', 'actor', 'could', 'be', 'movie', 'bad', 'Usually', 'like', 'movies', 'are', 'pointless', 'movie', 'was', 'movie', 'where', 'know', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'none', 'have', 'qualities', 'hero', 'final', 'point', 'am', 'going', 'make', 'how', 'director', 'inserted', 'action', 'video', 'game', 'was', 'ok', 'opening', 'credits', 'was', ""n't"", 'clever', 'idea', 'got', 'annoying', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'also', 'clear', 'rip-offs', 'Matrix', 'How', 'orignal', 'horror', 'movie', 'next', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'might.ENJOY', 'Rated', 'R', 'pervasive', 'strong', 'violence/gore', 'language', 'nudity']",House Of The Dead

788998,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,B0000YEE6C,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[8, 20]","I have to wonder what is going on with the popular opinions of many recent horror films such as House of the Dead and Cabin Fever.  There seems to be somewhat of a backlash against at least the mainstream examples of the genre--mainstream in the ""now playing in a Cineplex near you"" variety, not necessarily in terms of the origin or attitude of the film.I can't imagine that many of the negative reviews are coming serious horror fans, and before everyone gets up in arms, let me explain what I mean by ""serious horror fans"".  I don't mean someone who likes horror films a lot ""if they're good"", which is tautological and implies a person who probably would think that most of them aren't good.  I also don't mean someone who has seen, say, 20 or 30 horror films along the lines of The Exorcist, Halloween, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Silence of The Lambs, etc. and who says that they like more of those ""classics"" than they dislike (whether they really believe this, or think that they're supposed to believe this).  I mean someone who has been watching the genre for many years, who tries to see every horror film they can make available to themselves for viewing, and who likes a majority of those films.Most of the negative criticisms being lobbed at these recent films, although I think they are ultimately unjustified, could be lobbed in the same way against most of the films in the horror genre.  So anyone being consistent, and taking a serious look at the objective properties of the films, would have to also not like most of the hundred or so horror films made worldwide each year.  Note that I'm not saying anything elitist about ""serious horror fans"", although I am one of them.  I'm merely pointing out that I can't believe that the recent negative reviews of films like House of the Dead, House of 1000 Corpses, Cabin Fever, Wrong Turn, etc. can be written by people who fit the ""serious horror fan"" description as I have defined it above.All of these recent films lie solidly within the genre, with characteristic scripts, performances, effects, editing, etc.  They are also clearly made by crews (and not just the directors, but scriptwriters, effects persons, and so on) with a deep love of the genre, who are both transparently acknowledging their influences and trying to bring something new to the table.So what about House Of The Dead?  I thought it was brilliant.  For anyone who doesn't know already, it is an example of the recent ""video game film"" subgenre.  The game was a first-person shooter with lots of gory zombie action, but the filmmakers were also big fans of the zombie film genre, especially the George Romero films.  Additionally, the Sega folks wanted it to not just be an adaptation of either of the House of the Dead games, so the film has an original plot, which could be seen as a prequel to the games.Yes, you read that correctly, this film has a plot.  Most films do.  It would be very difficult to create a film without a plot, although there might be some examples of this, such as Brian Eno's Thursday Afternoon, if we can say that it isn't just a music video.  But even the Godfrey Reggio/Philip Glass trilogy, consisting of Koyaanisqatsi, Powaqqatsi and Naqoyqatsi, could be said to have a plot.  Plots can be poetic as well as prosaic.  House of the Dead however, has a fairly straightforward, linear plot.A quintet of young adults is headed to a rave on a secluded island.  They hire a wonderfully campy duo of sailors (one played by Clint Howard, who at this point in his enjoyable career suggests camp the moment he appears) to take them to the island, despite their protests about its safety.  When they arrive, things immediately go wrong, and they are quickly confronted with zombies.  I don't like to give to much of the film away to anyone who hasn't seen it already, but there are also subplots having to do with the sailors and the police, and two of the young adults who used to be mates.  There is also a great backstory about the origin of the zombies, which seems partially like a nod to Spanish horror maven Amando de Ossorio and his Blind Dead films.Although the story is enjoyable enough, and the performances are good, and standard for a horror film, ranging from campy to a kind of earnest obliviousness, what really stands out in this film is the zombie material, which is just as heavy on action as horror.  Director Uwe Boll achieves a thrilling, almost chaotic mayhem, and even better, goes over the top with some postmodern techniques.  Rather than shying away from the modern aspects of the genres he's working in, and the peculiarities of the video game film subgenre, he embraces them in a visceral way, producing an emotional effect that is akin to taking a loop in a roller coaster at 60 miles per hour.  The most prominent of these techniques is Boll's insertion of actual video game footage into the film, at first under the credits, then as a very creative wipe, and finally intercut with some of the action.  These work beautifully, as long as you view them less linearly and more like a Warhol painting.  Other embraced techniques include Mach 5 sequences of music-video style edits (during characters' mental flashbacks) and post-Matrix action sequences, which also have to be read more poetically.Of course, you don't have to analyze any of this stuff to enjoy the film.  But you probably have to be a (or at least be a potential) ""serious horror fan"" to enjoy it.",5,It's Difficult to Understand These Negative Reviews,1075248000,"01 28, 2004",2004,5458,"['have',

Not only does the driector think that we are idiots but he laces every line as if it's the best dialogue when really it feels like four year olds conversing in a playground. This kind of movie makes you ball up your fists and scream 'stop being so crappy!' This movie deserves zero stars. Although it did have a good cinematic style the plot of the movie was lost in a number of, I counted seven, scenes where the characters just run around shouting some lots person's name. Even the deleted scenes make no sense. How awful is that? If there's one little nugget that I have to leave you consider it this: There are some people who just don't know how to make a movie. If anything, rent it to laugh at it. It could turn into a great party game.

Although I didn't quite like Paul Anderson's RESIDENT EVIL of 2002, I must acknowledge that it had professionalism and at least some degree of tension. Oh yeah, and its coolness factor was through the roof.This film is utterly mind-blowing in its stupidity and sheer awfulness. I didn't give one hoot about any of these characters They are given mind-numbingly bad dialogue that no actor is capable of delivering. Not that any of them could. This movie will always be remember for this timeless line &quot;You did it all so you could be immortal. Why?!?&quot; I doubt I need to elaborate on the staggering stupidity of that statement. And I swear on my mother's grave, that is exactly how it appears in the movie.The really sad thing is that it isn't the least bit scary. With all the darkness and idea of the setting on an island, there is not a shred of tension or fear to be found. The zombies run around like confused extras, not even making an attempt to fit the conventional zombie-stagger. The gore is present but not done in any creative or interesting ways. If zombie gore with wit and hilarity is your thing, find DEAD ALIVE.As far as I counted, the film rips off to varying degrees, besides the obvious zombie films, Jaws, the Lord of the Rings (the now semi-famous shot of the creature looking out over the grove while characters huddle directly underneath him), I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (why, God, why?) and the Matrix. Notice that I said &quot;rip-off&quot; and not &quot;pay homage,&quot; which would suggest that they did it with some success.I am telling you all this a conniseur of direct-to-video horror films (I like creature in the water films) and I can tell you that this is easily as bad as most of them, and worse than some. This thing was a theatrical release, (albeit limited) and so it goes without saying that it should deliver some degree of quality. At least you will have a newfound respect for the horror-movie-victim who wanders off alone in the dark saying &quot;C'mon Matt.

Firstly, in answer to some of what I've read, and as many of the reviews I've written will bear out, I love horror crap movies. I've got a whole rampart of them on my shelf. But, here are some examples of good crap movies: Pieces, Burial ground &quot;The Nights of Terror&quot;, Humanoids From the Deep, Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things. This movie is not, NOT, on the good crap list in any way. With the exception of that one chick with the pleasing swells, I think that you would turn to a pillar of salt if you tried to watch this more than once.A bunch of dorks hop a boat with a cliche pirate captain (who is luckily smuggling one crate of weapons) and end up on this stupid island where some kind of lame party is now the sight of a massacre---without the massacre. Where did those original victims go? Most of the zombies you saw later looked too decomposed to have been the original party-goers. This, unfortunately, is one continuity problem in a thousand. So now the boat dorks, armed and ready for love, do cheesy stupid-looking battle with lame boogie-music zombies until they run out of ammo and die---BUT NOT QUICKLY ENOUGH. The only zombie movie I've seen that sucks worse than this one is Children of the Living Dead, but only by a very narrow margin. No self-respecting zombie would even spit on this movie.It turns out the guy in charge is some Reanimator rip-off bald dillweed from Spain or somewhere. He's been transplanting body parts and making these dizzy latex-headed zombies for no apparent reason. But of course his evil scheme finally comes to fruition, when somebody decides to have a party on an island in the middle of nowhere, dropped off, I might add, by ships that don't even stayed moored in the general vicinity. Also, I would like to say that I agree with the reviewer who wanted to give this movie negative stars; alas, if only we could.",1,Worse than a lard roll with mayonnaise,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,1997,"['loathing', 'difficult', 'center', 'organized', 'review', 'festering', 'stink', 'bomb', 'movie', 'Firstly', 'answer', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'many', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'written', 'will', 'bear', 'out', 'love', 'horror', 'crap', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'got', 'whole', 'rampart', 'shelf', 'here', 'are', 'examples', 'good', 'crap', 'movies', 'Pieces', 'Burial', 'ground', 'quot', 'Nights', 'Terror', 'quot', 'Humanoids', 'Deep', 'Children', 'Should', ""n't"", 'Play', 'Dead', 'Things', 'movie', 'not', 'NOT', 'good', 'crap', 'list', 'way', 'exception', 'one', 'chick', 'pleasing', 'swells', 'think', 'would', 'turn', 'pillar', 'salt', 'tried', 'watch', 'more', 'once.A', 'bunch', 'dorks', 'hop', 'boat', 'cliche', 'pirate', 'captain', 'who', 'luckily', 'smuggling', 'one', 'crate', 'weapons', 'end', 'up', 'stupid', 'island', 'where', 'kind', 'lame', 'party', 'now', 'sight', 'massacre', 'massacre', 'Where', 'did', 'original', 'victims', 'go', 'Most', 'zombies', 'saw', 'later', 'looked', 'too', 'decomposed', 'have', 'been', 'original', 'party-goers', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'continuity', 'problem', 'thousand', 'So', 'now', 'boat', 'dorks', 'armed', 'ready', 'love', 'do', 'cheesy', 'stupid-looking', 'battle', 'lame', 'boogie-music', 'zombies', 'run', 'ammo', 'die', 'NOT', 'QUICKLY', 'ENOUGH', 'only', 'zombie', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'one', 'Children', 'Living', 'Dead', 'only', 'very', 'narrow', 'margin', 'self-respecting', 'zombie', 'would', 'even', 'spit', 'movie.It', 'out', 'guy', 'charge', 'Reanimator', 'rip-off', 'bald', 'dillweed', 'Spain', 'somewhere', 'been', 'transplanting', 'body', 'parts', 'making', 'dizzy', 'latex-headed', 'zombies', 'apparent', 'reason', 'course', 'evil', 'scheme', 'finally', 'fruition', 'when', 'somebody', 'have', 'party', 'island', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'dropped', 'might', 'add', 'ships', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'stayed', 'moored', 'general', 'vicinity', 'Also', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'wanted', 'give', 'movie', 'negative', 'stars', 'alas', 'only', 'could']",House Of The Dead

789013,A319SKSB556033,B0000YEE6C,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[101, 111]","There are people out there who will greenlight anything! That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists. And that's only scary part to the whole movie. It's so bad you'll go off movies forever. I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing. I don't know why I do these bad things to myself.As if it matters, here's the basic jist of the 'story'. A group of twenty-somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Pacific Northwest (Canada actually, because it's cheap) for the 'Rave of the Century' (which consists of about 8 people and un-raving music) that they pay some craggy old fisherman $1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry. That's gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead (hang on-I thought this was HOUSE of the Dead?) and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda.First faults here. Why would a tiny little rave (of the Century my foot!) be held on some remote island? Why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it? Why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others?Once they arrive they discover that the rave (which consists of about 2 tents, a small stage and a port-a-john) has been smashed, there's blood everywhere and no one is around. What would any rationally thinking person do? Run for their lives of course. But no, these clueless, obviously blind people decide to go look for them. Soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside. Another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows, as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters, and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again. The characters, like the movie, go nowhere.Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue, heinous acting, mumbo-jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once-popular arcade game of the same name. Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I'll never know. The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further, if that is at all possible.It has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap, throwaway line at the end. It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems multi-Oscar worthy in comparison to this junk. The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow. He could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast suck I'm afraid. The characters are idiots and deserve to die.Plus, if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity, I see no reason why this film cannot be shown on Saturday morning TV. It's not frightening in the slightest. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film. And where did all those bad guys come from anyway? There were only a few people on the island to begin with. I guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over. I kid you not, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times.Who's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than director Uwe Boll. His control over the movie is non-existent. You can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren't really taking it all seriously. The actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card. It all feels very unnatural.Plus the film is shot like a two-part mini-series. I have indeed seen better TV productions. And don't get me started on the editing. The film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans. No real skill or talent was put into making this at all. It truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and George A. Romero can't even get anyone to take his calls. House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be 'post-modern' but it only irritates that they think THIS is in the same league as a REAL zombie movie.For what it's worth, the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over-used ADR even more. The DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself. Isn't this review warning enough? Stay away! You are all doomed I tell you! Doomed!

789018,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0000YEE6C,Jason,"[3, 3]","House of the Dead is a story of friends with intentions of going to the ""Rave of the Year"", but end up starring in one of the worst movies of all time.  If this movie wasn't specifically made for Mystery Science Theatre 3000 ridicule, then it was created with intentions of breaking the cinema scale of unintentional comedy.Narrated by dim-witted protagonist Rudy, the friends fill out the cornucopia of stereotypical horror movie: Greg, the hormonally hyper best friend; Simon, the superficially idiotic third wheel; Cynthia, the blonde who serves as cannon fodder; Alicia, Rudy's ex-girlfriend who provides the unnecessary pointless love side-story; the Asian chick wearing a red, white, and blue spandex outfit (conveniently named Liberty); and a token black chick with a ROBOTIC.ACTING.DELIVERY.The group is attempting to get to a remote island rave on Isla del Muerte, which translates loosely in Spanish to ""Site of the Lamest Rave ever"".  They hire a gun-smuggling German ship-captain named Captain Kirk - yeah, Cpt. Kirk - to take them to the isolated rave for $1000 on an island that will henceforth be named ""Thousand Island"".  Captain Kirk, and his first-mate (Clint Howard), take the group to the island, where previous scenes displayed a Sega-sponsored rave, where, naturally, there is at least one big-breasted Asian chick hired for some topless dancing.In no time at all, a guy named Matt dies a deserved death for the travesty of wearing white penny loafers, and full-frontal, gratuitous nudity fills the time before the inevitable zombie attack wave.  It's also clear early on that horny kid = dead kid, and skinny dipper = dead kid.  Meanwhile, there are completely random and pointless insertions of video game footage - as if a viewer needed to be reminded about the inspiration for such insipid nonsense.When the attack finally happens, the viewer quickly learns about the unique abilities of this island's zombies.  After Simon utters, ""Simon says"" - a phrase no person named Simon should ever say - he learns that some zombies can spit face-disfiguring acid roughly five feet.  Simon says, get that man some aloe vera!  Along with acid-spitters, there is a swarm of completely coordinate zombies that can climb, swim, and use weapons.  When the pop-out of the water during surprise attacks, the group engages in two compelling games of Whack-a-Mole, blasting each swim-team zombie as they surface.The rest of the movie explores the hunting and killing abilities of the zombie axe-throwing gymnastic team (you have to see it to believe it), zombie track team, and Gallagher Zombie - a man who has fallen on hard times since the price of watermelon has skyrocketed - chase down the group, Cpt. Kirk, and a female shore patrol officer named Casper who has a magic pistol with unlimited ammo refills.This is easily one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and there isn't a single second that goes by without the potential for unintentional comedy and MST3K fun.

789020,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0000YEE6C,Jeffrey Leach,"[2, 3]","""House of the Dead"" should have been a wonderful film. Based on a shoot 'em up video game that I've never played, the story deals with a bunch of kids trying to stay alive on a deserted island overflowing with hundreds of flesheating zombies. Sounds like a winner, doesn't it? I thought so too. I generally enjoy zombie pictures, everything from Lucio Fulci's gorefests ""The Beyond"" and ""Zombie"" to George Romero's Dead Trilogy. I am, in fact, quite excited by the news that Romero is making a brand new zombie film as we speak, the anxiously awaited ""Land of the Dead."" ""House of the Dead,"" I thought, would easily claim a respectable place in the zombie canon. The growing sense of unease I felt within the first five minutes didn't set off alarm bells. ""O.k.,"" I thought, ""Maybe it just needs to warm up a bit before the good stuff starts."" I waited. Then I waited some more. Ever increasing glances at my watch began to instill in me a dread that grew rather than decreased. As the end credits rolled, I sat back to do a mental post-mortem on what went wrong with ""House of the Dead."" My conclusion? Everything. Everything that could go wrong went horribly wrong in this clunker of a horror movie. Even the gore couldn't save it.""House of the Dead"" begins by introducing us to a group of airheads that should be instantly recognizable to anyone with horror film experience. You have the testosterone fueled jerk, the snobby girl, the smart one, blah blah blah. Frankly, I don't even remember most of their names except for Rudy (Jonathan Cherry) and Alicia (Ona Grauer). It helps to realize that you don't really need to remember names in films like this one. They don't make the characters stand out and, most importantly, nearly all of the kids are cannon fodder anyway. Our little group plans on attending a rave on a deserted island, but discovers the boat left without them when they arrive at the wharf. One of the youngsters hires Captain Kirk (Jurgen Prochnow) to take them to the island. When Kirk's helper Salish (Clint Howard) hears about the plan, he expresses serious reservations about the jaunt. He regales the travelers with grave warnings about death and destruction on the island, a warning that goes unheeded by the kids. They just want to get to the party, which they eventually do when Kirk drops them off. Oddly, not a soul is at the rave when our heroes show up. The stage is there, as is the music equipment and alcoholic beverages, but nary a raver turns up to welcome them. Cue Twilight Zone theme music.We know something horrible happened to the kids on the island, and the new arrivals soon find out what it was when they uncover a survivor and a videotape of the incident. Sure looks to me like a mess of zombies ripping it up, literally, on the dance floor. These aren't your normal shambling zombies of yesteryear, but reanimated corpses that like to jump, run fast, and swim. Eventually the kids stumble over a heavily armed Coast Guard officer named Jordan Casper (Ellie Cornell) and reunite with a now sans Salish Captain Kirk. We discover that Kirk is a smuggler of military hardware, which comes in mighty handy when faced with hordes of hungry undead. After passing the weapons out, the group marches inland toward a small cabin. What follows is a massive confrontation between human and zombie, done with heaps of slow motion and ""The Matrix"" style special effects. Neat, huh? Not really. The movie becomes more ridiculous once the action moves into the house. We learn that Salish's vague warnings about the island were spot on, that some Spanish priest/black magic guy back in the seventeenth century tried to figure out a way to achieve immortality. He moved his operations to the island to practice his arcane arts. Needless to say, he succeeded in part. More's the pity for us.The best thing I can say about ""House of the Dead"" is that the gore isn't half bad. It's always nice to see a movie with exploding heads. But it stops there. The acting in the film is atrocious, which I expect from the largely no name kids. But to see Jurgen Prochnow, the man who starred in ""Das Boot,"" appearing in dreck like this really hurts. The fact that someone makes a ""Das Boot"" joke seconds after Prochnow's character shows up hurts even more. And why name him Captain Kirk? What's the connection between his character and Star Trek? None, as far as I can see. Even more disconcerting is the presence of the venerable Clint Howard as Salish. Howard, whose B movie credits are extensive and often entertaining, doesn't have much to do here. He mostly stumbles around in a rain slicker while mumbling his lines in a harsh, gravelly tone that is supremely irritating. It's sad to see two actors lower themselves to this level. But what really annoys me about this movie was director Uwe Boll's inexplicable decision to insert images from the videogame in the film. When the characters are blowing away zombies, we occasionally see a scene from the videogame flash by on the screen. This is one of the most incomprehensible things I've ever seen in a movie.The ""House of the Dead"" DVD comes with plenty of extras--including deleted scenes, storyboards, a documentary on the film, trailers, and two commentary tracks--but you won't care about them after watching the film. It is disappointing to see George Romero and Tom Savini talking this film up, but such is the world of Hollywood hype. In the future, I'm sticking to the classic zombie standbys. Incredibly, I hear a ""House of the Dead 2"" will soon arrive on the scene. I sure hope not.",1,Oh the humanity!,1102723200,"12 11, 2004",2004,5571,"['House', 'Dead', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Based', 'shoot', 'up', 'video', 'game', ""'ve"", 'never',

(Evil Dead, Day of the Dead, heck Shaun of the Dead).This is one giant craptacular commercial for a Sega game of the same name: House of the Dead.  Since Hollywood refuses to kill all its current writers and hire new ones, we are treated to Remakes of old classics, Sequels that should never be made (I'm still waiting for Titanic 2... don't disappoint me hollywood) and VIDEO GAMES being made into movies.  ::sigh::  The canadian bunch that made this mess and dragged poor Jurgen Pronchow and even Clint Howard into this should be dragged into the street and flogged.  First as the movie goes from scene to scene we are treated to video game clips of the actual SEGA game... as well as tons of SEGA placed ads.  (If this mess cost 7 million to make, SEGA put up 6 of it I'm sure.) If a character dies in the movie we are treated to a psuedo-matrix 360 degree spin and a cheesy red tint wipe effect, exactly like the game.  When Mortal Kombat came out as a movie, I actually saw it in the theatre.  It wasn't the best, but at least they didn't have giant ""FINISH HIM"" graphics or cut scenes from the game interspersed through out the movie.  I GET IT.  IT'S A GAME. NOW IT'S A MOVIE.  NOW YOU ARE SMOOSHING BOTH TOGETHER.  Let's continue down the list, the acting for all intents and purposes is flat, boring and uninspired.  I've seen worse, but nothing here made me care about the characters at all.  I take that back.  Sporting a laced up corset, Ona Grauer's character, Alicia, runs around most of the movie making sure her ample cleavage is visible and bust is swaying.  Indeed she is the sole redeeming special effect to this god awful trash.  The otherwise ham-fisted plot shoved down our throats in 2.5 minutes of dialogue. (1 minute from jurgen pronchow the other full minute from the head bad guy and 30 seconds from Ona Grauer stumbling across a book with all the other plot points, No doubt the cover read ""SCRIPT"" *smirk*)Let's sum up.  The good: Ona Grauer's cans and it's less than 2 hours long.  The bad: under developed plot, poor dialogue, clunky execution, sound quality, sega ads, sega scene changes, wooden acting. I'm voluntarily giving this 1 star.  Which is actually a compliment.  I have been FORCED to gave far worse ""movies"" the same. Amazon won't let me give zero or negative scores.",1,Say it.....

This film scrapes the bottom of the barrel for any originality at all. Yes it is based on a video game which can only mean one thing, advertisement for the game itself. In Mortal Kombat a loose plot was centralized around getting as many characters onto the screen whether they fit into the story or not. However House of the Dead takes this ine step lower.As you watch the movie, inserted into the fight scenes are 'actual' scenes from the game! That's right folks, whoever came up with this, thought it would be wonderful to watch the video game pixels as you watched the movie. I coudldn't believe they actually did this. They took an otherwise bad movie and melted the cheese all over it.Second we also have to endure a super long extended fight scene with not only the video game scenes but with second rate and very overused 'Matrix' stunts. They are terrible. Maybe the shot spreading out from the shotgun was a good idea, but it was executed horribly.The characters are as thin as paper and as wooden as Grandma's breakfast table.

I really was expecting to see a skinemax movie break out at any second, but alas, no gratuitous dry humping... only exploding heads and moss monsters running back and forth mercifully out of focus and barely in frame. The production team blew their proverbial wad on one fight scene that has about 30 examples of the worst execution of the now cliche Matrix roto-camera effect. In any *ahem* self respecting knock off, they would attempt to give the effect a little bit of justice with some sort of cool pose to capture, but in House of the Dead they bust it out on almost every shot in this one scene. I thought I caught a roto-action shot of one of the characters picking their nose. The rest were just ho-hum captures of the heroes walking through the graveyard popping caps in some really lame looking zombies, intercut with A-Team quality , zombie launching, explosions. Oh yeah, everybody becomes a blackbelt weapons expert in this scene after being a bunch of screaming, useless teens up until then. It is jaw-droppingly bad.There's even the obligatory ""look at me, I'm a terrible movie with weak narrative,"" voiceover. The narrator tells you right at the beginning that none of the characters are likeable and that all of them will die. Gee... Smart way to start it off geniuses.  Tell us to hate the characters before we even get a chance to by seeing the dumb stuff they do. He pops up at other random times during the movie to throw in some more completely useless info.

789039,A1ZKAHFYCJRGQM,B0000YEE6C,Kenneth V. Cockrel,"[0, 0]","(...)""House of the Dead"" has to be one of the worst movies of 2003.  Though I'd heard nothing but bad things about it, I had a free rental coupon from my local video store and opted to take a chance.Plus the movie is executive produced by Mark Altman, whose columns I've enjoyed in Cinescape Magazine.  Altman also wrote and directed ""Free Enterprise,"" a sort of ""Swingers"" for the ""Star Trek"" set that was at times howlingly funny.  Given Altman's obvious knowledge of and love for genre films, I figured the movie couldn't be that bad.Big mistake! It's not just that bad.  It's worse!  My advice is to avoid this movie  even when it hits cable as watching it will only make you feel like you deserve hazard pay for the hour and 45 minutes you'll spend suffering through it.This is the sort of movie where characters actually utter such banal cliches as ""It's too quiet,"" the type of film where people who've never fired guns before are suddenly able to mow down zombies like seasoned soldiers of fortune after only five minutes of weapons training.It's also the type of flick made by a director and producer who apparently haven't figured out that after rip-offs in everything from ""Mission Impossible 2"" to ""Scary Movie,""  ""Matrix""-style bullet-time fight scenes are about as fresh and hip as pet rocks and hula hoops.The film features a nonsensical plot, characters who serve no purpose other than to be killed by numbers, and zombie makeup that the average high school kid with a vivid imagination and too much time on his hands can surpass.  And while the film tries to overcompensate with T and A, there's not even enough of that to make the film watchable on a horny frat boy level.The DVD's sole redeeming quality is a documentary which features interviews with George Romero, the director of the original Dead Trilogy and Tom Savini, who did the makeup effects for both the original  ""Dawn of the Dead""  and ""Day of the Dead.""It's great to see that the team behind ""House"" thought enough of the originators of the zombie genre to pay tribute to them.  However, this only highlights what a vastly inferior film this is when compared to the original Dead Trilogy.Of course there are those who'd say, ""It's a movie based on a video game so what do you expect?""  (...)Of couse, with a ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake on the horizon and ""Resident Evil 2"" not far behind, it would seem the zombie movie genre is about to enjoy a full-fledged comeback.But even if those movies end up being major disappointments, they will likely not be even half as bad as ""House of the Dead.""",1,House of the Dumb,1079913600,"03 22, 2004",2004,2574,"['House', 'Dead', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', '2003', ""'d"", 'heard', 'nothing', 'bad', 'things', 'had', 'free', 'rental', 'coupon', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'opted', 'take', 'chance.Plus', 'movie', 'executive', 'produced', 'Mark', 'Altman', 'columns', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Cinescape', 'Magazine', 'Altman', 'also', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Free', 'Enterprise', 'sort', 'Swingers', 'Star', 'Trek', 'set', 'was', 'times', 'howlingly', 'funny', 'Given', 'Altman', 'obvious', 'knowledge', 'love', 'genre', 'films', 'figured', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad.Big', 'mistake', 'not', 'just', 'bad', 'worse', 'advice', 'avoid', 'movie', 'even', 'when', 'cable', 'watching', 'will', 'only', 'make', 'feel', 'deserve', 'hazard', 'pay', 'hour', '45', 'minutes', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'suffering', 'it.This', 'sort', 'movie', 'where', 'characters', 'actually', 'utter', 'such', 'banal', 'cliches', 'too', 'quiet', 'type', 'film', 'where', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'fired', 'guns', 'are', 'suddenly', 'able', 'mow', 'down', 'zombies', 'seasoned', 'soldiers', 'fortune', 'only', 'five', 'minutes', 'weapons', 'training.It', 'also', 'type', 'flick', 'made', 'director', 'producer', 'who', 'apparently', 'have', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'rip-offs', 'everything', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'Matrix', '-style', 'bullet-time', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'fresh', 'hip', 'pet', 'rocks', 'hula', 'hoops.The', 'film', 'nonsensical', 'plot', 'characters', 'who', 'serve', 'purpose', 'other', 'be', 'killed', 'numbers', 'zombie', 'makeup', 'average', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'can', 'surpass', 'film', 'tries', 'overcompensate', 'T', 'A', 'not', 'even', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'watchable', 'horny', 'frat', 'level.The', 'DVD', 'sole', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'George', 'Romero', 'director', 'original', 'Dead', 'Trilogy', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'who', 'did', 'makeup', 'effects', 'original', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Day', 'Dead', 'great', 'see', 'team', 'House', 'thought', 'enough', 'originators', 'zombie', 'genre', 'pay', 'tribute', 'However', 'only', 'what', 'vastly', 'inferior', 'film', 'when', 'compared', 'original', 'Dead', 'Trilogy.Of', 'course', 'are', 'who', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'so', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'couse', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'remake', 'horizon', 'Resident', 'Evil', '2', 'not', 'far', 'would', 'seem', 'zombie', 'movie', 'genre', 'enjoy', 'full-fledged', 'comeback.But', 'even', 'movies', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'major', 'disappointments', 'will', 'likely', 'not', 'be', 'even', 'half', 'as', 'bad', 'House', 'Dead']",House Of The Dead

I suspect that everybody who worked on this film was serious. This movie is so bad it's pathetic. It' likes watching Old Yeller get shot, seeing Litte Timmy drown in the well and finding out that the department store Santa is just a guy from Skid Row who was sobered up for the evening.I won't get into the plot becuase there aint any but there's a  scene in it that's  so dumb it haunts me and is a perfect example of the whole film.  One of the ""teens"" (Why do teenagers in horror movies all look like they're on the wrong side of 30?) decides to fight the zombies with karate. Karate on the undead. Think about that.I don't care if you studied for five years under  Pei Mei and David Carradine was your sensei, karate is not going to cut it when fighting zombies unless you're going to do the flying walk to safety thing. She gets eaten of course and one of her companions just stands there and looks. He has no reaction at all.

789050,A36EMEZX84IKSB,B0000YEE6C,Michael Greenwaldt,"[0, 2]","Everyone kept saying how awful this movie was, but I didn't think it could be THAT bad. Even if it was cheesy, it looked like it would be fun and entertaining. Well, I was proved wrong. The acting in this movie is easily some of the very worst of the year and the lines are hilariously stupid. I couldn't believe my ears. Stuff like this usually makes for good entertainment though, something to laugh at, yet it was actually kind of boring. Don't get me wrong, there's still plenty to laugh at, but this movie just wasn't as entertaining as it should have and could have been. If you're going to make a bad movie, at least make it entertaining! It had too many boring moments. I've seen a lot better horror movies go straight-to-video.I loved Ellie Cornell in Halloween 4 and 5, and was looking forward to seeing her in something again. But sadly, the awful acting of the other actors must have rubbed off on her, or she lost her touch (she was never this bad in Halloween 4 and 5), because her performance is bad too. Hopefully she'll show up in a good movie giving a good performance soon. Of course, she's nowhere near the worst of the bunch, and next to the others, she actually manages to come out of this unscathed. Clint Howard was downright awful here. Oh my god, I couldn't believe how bad his acting was and the awful lines he said. One of the worst and most hilarious ones was ""Why? Why? Why? They always ask why!"" It might not sound that hilarious on its own, but when you hear it in the movie and how badly the line is delivered, you'll surely find it hilariously awful too. Another one of the worst performances in this movie comes from Jonathan Cherry as Rudy. Everything he said sounded so bad, especially the ending voice-over. Tyron Leitso was also really bad as Simon. Instead of going through every person though and saying they were bad, I'll just save myself the trouble and say that they're all bad. That includes Jurgen Prochnow as Capt. Victor Kirk and Ona Grauer as Alicia. I did love Alicia's hilariously ridiculous line ""Why aren't these zombies alive like the other ones?"" (Umm, because they're dead! That's like going to a cemetery and going ""Why aren't these people alive like us?"") That line was so stupid and so funny. And when Liberty (Kira Clavell) yells out ""There must be some kind of scientific explanation for this!"" I was immediately reminded of something Anna Faris would say in one of the Scary Movie movies, and the way Clavell said it even sounded like how Anna Faris would say it. It's pretty bad when a line in a movie sounds like it's something out of a spoof. Of course, it's hilarious nonetheless. While watching this movie, you can't help but think that they had to have made it this bad on purpose. How could you not have? There's no way you couldn't know that the movie you were making was awful.House of The Dead is proof that you don't have to have any talent in order to be an actor. Anyone can be an actor, however, your talent or lack of will determine what kind of movies you're in. For people that have absolutely no acting talent, you will be in movies like House of The Dead. If any aspiring actors out there think that they stink and will never get cast in a movie, watch House of The Dead and you'll be given hope. I mean, this even got a wide release in theaters and didn't go straight-to-video. Speaking of which, it's pretty sad when movies like this can get a wide release in theaters but not actual good/great horror films like May or Ginger Snaps. I highly recommend anyone thinking about renting this movie that hasn't seen those yet to rent one of them instead. Or if you want a zombie movie, get the far superior 28 Days Later.House of The Dead has its entertaining moments, and the movie does look good, but that's about it. I recommend skipping it.P.S. Uwe Boll, please pull some strings and cast me in House of The Dead 2, I'm sure I wouldn't be any worse than the actors in this one.Grade: 4/10 (D+)",2,I didn't think it could be THAT bad.

From zombies that seem out ofCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonwith their tree jumping abilities, to swimming zombies, to the director's use of video game like approach to shooting the movie, to the really really really bad accents.The movie is about a group of friends that go to a rave in an island by the name of 'Isla de la Muerte' (Island of Death). There, they encounter zombies, tons of zombies and start dropping one by one.As I mentioned the director used a video game like approach, with images from the arcade gameHouse of The Deadand whenever someone dies the screen revolves around the character and becomes red. The director also uses this revolving camera motion for the action and shooting scenes.  The soundtrack is pretty good (befitting of a rave), at least much better than the movie itself. The director uses a lot of slow motion techniques to show the bullets firing and some action sequences.There are a lot of clich&eacute;s in the movie: from ""there must be a scientific explanation"", a member of the group wearing the requisite goofy outfit with 'Matrix-like' moves, stupidity, and of course the zombies. The people got tough fast, as soon as they were given weapons and instantly learned how to use them. ""Movie Rapid Learning Technique"": All for the sake of some action! I mean, these people are fighting like pros. And swords, let's not forget the swords or the machetes!The movie also has 'Matrix-like scenes' downright to ripping off the moves.

789062,ARIHVRQ9VH0OQ,B0000YEE6C,Nick Schwartz,"[0, 1]","I was really excited to see the House of the Dead in the theaters.  I had been following its progress in the pages of a couple of different gaming magazines since it was announced, and as a huge fan of the original, (and second) arcade games, as well as the Typing of the Dead spin-off for Dreamcast, I was almost sure I'd like the movie.Well, it came and went from the theaters in a matter of two weeks or so, so I never got a chance to go see it.  But now that's it out on DVD, I recently rented a opy, and got more or less exactly what I expected, and didn't anything by not seeing it on the big screen.Many reviews of the movie I've read online have been unbelievably hard on the movie.  Some of what those reviews said are true.  The editors of the movie did insert little bits of footage from the game trilogy in the middle of the film, but I personally feel they add to the overall mood of the movie, and put further emphasis on some key parts, as well as offer transitions from one scene to the next.  But why someone would pan this movie for using this game footage is a little beyond my understanding for the two following reasons: A.) We're not talking minutes of footage at a time here.  The game footage is only seconds long each time you see it, and it couldn't possibly amount to more than one or two minutes of the total movie length, (excluding the opening credits, which use some game footage as a background).  B.)it's a movie based on A GAME!  The game footage simply adds to that overall atmosphere, and does it quite well.Now, moving on to the actual movie.  I'll start by saying something other reviews have already said countless times: The acting is horrible.  Especially in the beginning, it really is quite bad.  But, again, this is exactly what I expected renting a B-movie like this one, and I wasn't in the least bit surprised.But beyond the poor acting is actually a pretty fun movie, blending action elements from movies like Resident Evil and Blade, with some special effects and fight scenes from the Matrix.  This isn't a horror movie by any means.  It is gory, limbs are hacked off, etc, but it isn't meant to be frightening.The action scenes were actually really entertaining.  The main one towards the middle of the film, when the heroes are seeking shelter in the house, (more of a large shack), was long and a bit repetitive, but very fun to watch.  The camera pans around each character as they pose in action, frozen still, and the shows that specific charcater in combat, which reminded me of perhaps switching charcaters in a videogame.  The slowmotion, ""bullet-time"" effects don't add anything to the movie, but didn't take away anything either, and there are two shots in particular I thought were very impressive.When characters die, the camera shows them standing up again, frozen still, and pans around them as blood drips down the screen, also reminding me of ""game over"" screens in a number of different games.And, most importantly, the movie does a remarkable job of capturing what it felt like playing the original arcade game.  Sure, the run-down shack of a house isn't anything like the mansion in the first game, but some of the scenes - particularly the underground tunnels in the end of the movie - are almost straight out of the game, and the movie proves this by splicing in footage of the game during these sequences.So, overall, if you were a fan of Blade or the Resident Evil movie, and can stand some terrible acting, then by all mean,s enjoy this movie.  Better still, if you liked the game, check this movie out just for fun, and you might actually enjoy it.",3,3 and a Half Stars-Good for Fans of the Game,1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,3624,"['was', 'really', 'excited', 'see', 'House', 'Dead', 'theaters', 'had', 'been', 'following', 'progress', 'pages', 'couple', 'different', 'gaming', 'magazines', 'was', 'announced', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'second', 'arcade', 'games', 'as', 'well', 'Typing', 'Dead', 'spin-off', 'Dreamcast', 'was', 'almost', 'sure', ""'d"", 'like', 'movie.Well', 'came', 'went', 'theaters', 'matter', 'two', 'weeks', 'so', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'go', 'see', 'now', 'out', 'DVD', 'recently', 'rented', 'opy', 'got', 'more', 'less', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'did', ""n't"", 'anything', 'not', 'seeing', 'big', 'screen.Many', 'reviews', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'read', 'online', 'have', 'been', 'unbelievably', 'hard', 'movie', 'what', 'reviews', 'said', 'are', 'true', 'editors', 'movie', 'did', 'insert', 'little', 'bits', 'footage', 'game', 'trilogy', 'middle', 'film', 'personally', 'feel', 'add', 'overall', 'mood', 'movie', 'put', 'further', 'emphasis', 'key', 'parts', 'as', 'well', 'offer', 'transitions', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'pan', 'movie', 'using', 'game', 'footage', 'little', 'understanding', 'two', 'following', 'reasons', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'minutes', 'footage', 'time', 'here', 'game', 'footage', 'only', 'seconds', 'long', 'time', 'see', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'amount', 'more', 'one', 'two', 'minutes', 'total', 'movie', 'length', 'excluding', 'opening', 'credits', 'use', 'game', 'footage', 'background', 'B', 'movie', 'based', 'A', 'GAME', 'game', 'footage', 'simply', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'quite', 'moving', 'actual', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', 'something', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'countless', 'times', 'acting', 'horrible', 'Especially', 'beginning', 'really', 'quite', 'bad', 'again', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'renting', 'B-movie', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'least', 'bit', 'surprised.But', 'poor', 'acting', 'actually', 'pretty', 'fun', 'movie', 'blending', 'action', 'elements', 'movies', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Blade', 'special', 'effects', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Matrix', ""n't"", 'horror', 'movie', 'means', 'gory', 'are', 'hacked', 'off', 'etc', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'frightening.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'actually', 'really', 'entertaining', 'main', 'one', 'middle', 'film', 'when', 'heroes', 'are', 'seeking', 'shelter', 'house', 'more', 'large', 'shack', 'was', 'long', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'camera', 'character', 'pose', 'action', 'frozen', 'still', 'shows', 'specific', 'charcater', 'combat', 'reminded', 'perhaps', 'switching', 'charcaters', 'videogame', 'slowmotion', 'bullet-time', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'anything', 'are', 'two', 'shots', 'particular', 'thought', 'were', 'very', 'impressive.When', 'characters', 'die', 'camera', 'standing', 'up', 'again', 'frozen', 'still', 'pans', 'around', 'blood', 'drips', 'down', 'screen', 'also', 'reminding', 'game', 'screens', 'number', 'different', 'games.And', 'most', 'importantly', 'movie', 'remarkable', 'job', 'capturing', 'what', 'felt', 'playing', 'original', 'arcade', 'game', 'Sure', 'run-down', 'shack', 'house', ""n't"", 'anything', 'mansion', 'first', 'game', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'underground', 'tunnels', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'almost', 'straight', 'game', 'movie', 'splicing', 'footage', 'game', 'sequences.So', 'overall', 'were', 'fan', 'Blade', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'movie', 'can', 'stand', 'terrible', 'acting', 'then', 'mean', 's', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Better', 'still', 'liked', 'game', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'just', 'fun', 'might', 'actually', 'enjoy']",House Of The Dead

Ferrigno ""firehouse444""","[2, 2]","Obviously attempting to cash in on the box office success of the ""Resident Evil"" video game film adaptation, comes this shoddy on screen version of the equally highly popular arcade game ""House of the Dead"". Once again, the living dead are the threat, and a small group of people must do battle with a seeming army of decaying, flesh eating corpses.However, ""House of the Dead"" looks to have been made on a very lean budget, mostly spent on ghoulish make up, exploding corpses and rattling semi-automatic weapons. It certainly wasn't spent on actors with the only two notable names in the cast being Jurgen Prochnow, playing another steely sea captain ( although he looks a long way away from the set of ""Das Boot"" ) , and weirdo character actor Clint Howard, ditto playing another slighty oddball role, like many of his previous performances. The remainder of the highly disposable early twenties aged cast swing between woeful and mediocre in their on screen displays.....no threat to the Oscars from this bunch.The story basically kicks off with a large group of over-sexed 18-25 year olds ( plenty of gratuitous breast shots abound to keep young minds interested ) attending a rave party on a spooky island.....heck knows, why you would hold a rave party in broad daylight in the middle of a forest on a haunted island ?? A further half dozen youngsters turn up later to find out that the rave party was closed early due to the arrival of the aforementioned zombies, who proceeded to eat most of the drugged out dance fans. What follows then is the standard ""cat and mouse"" game of the kids being pursued by the living dead, and generally one by one they fall victim to a sharp set of zombie teeth. Luckily for them, Jurgen Prochnow was smuggling cigars & guns, so there's plenty of hardware for the embattled survivors to utilise in their battle with the zombies....most of which looks like a Rob Zombie video clip, and to make sure you remember you're watching ""House of the Dead"", they regularly insert screen shots from the video game amongst the live action ???  Which makes it look like a strange, disjointed ""Scooby Doo"" episode !!And I also forgot to mention that there is plenty of ""The Matrix"" type slo-mo camera work, levitating action heroes and bullets and hatchets whistling through the air, also in slow motion ( but Keanu Reeves is nowhere to be seen ! )And finally the film climaxes with some strange revelation that the entire zombie fraternity is being run by a 500 year old Spanish sadist / witch doctor who is constantly on the look out for new recruits for his decaying ranks, before the FBI arrives to rescue the survivors. In summary, a very lack lustre ""zombie genre"" effort that seems to be aimed at an audience somwhere between 12-16 years of age ( at least ""Resident Evil"" was aiming a few years higher ). And its weak plot and shocking characterisations are further hampered by the very low budget feel of the entire production.....strictly watch for curiosity's sake only, or a ""How To Guide"" on how NOT to make a zombie film.",2,"This is ""Scoobie Doo"" meets ""Dawn of the Dead"" !!",1100563200,"11 16, 2004",2004,3060,"['Obviously', 'attempting', 'cash', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'video', 'game', 'film', 'adaptation', 'shoddy', 'screen', 'version', 'equally', 'highly', 'popular', 'arcade', 'game', 'House', 'Dead', 'Once', 'again', 'living', 'dead', 'are', 'threat', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'must', 'do', 'battle', 'seeming', 'army', 'decaying', 'flesh', 'eating', 'corpses.However', 'House', 'Dead', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'very', 'lean', 'budget', 'mostly', 'spent', 'ghoulish', 'make', 'up', 'exploding', 'corpses', 'rattling', 'semi-automatic', 'weapons', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'spent', 'actors', 'only', 'two', 'notable', 'names', 'cast', 'being', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'playing', 'steely', 'sea', 'captain', 'long', 'way', 'away', 'set', 'Das', 'Boot', 'weirdo', 'character', 'actor', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'ditto', 'playing', 'slighty', 'oddball', 'role', 'many', 'previous', 'performances', 'remainder', 'highly', 'disposable', 'early', 'twenties', 'aged', 'cast', 'swing', 'woeful', 'mediocre', 'screen', 'displays', '..no', 'threat', 'Oscars', 'bunch.The', 'story', 'basically', 'off', 'large', 'group', 'over-sexed', '18-25', 'year', 'olds', 'plenty', 'gratuitous', 'breast', 'shots', 'abound', 'keep', 'young', 'minds', 'interested', 'attending', 'rave', 'party', 'spooky', 'island', '..heck', 'knows', 'why', 'would', 'hold', 'rave', 'party', 'broad', 'daylight', 'middle', 'forest', 'haunted', 'island', 'further', 'half', 'dozen', 'youngsters', 'turn', 'up', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'rave', 'party', 'was', 'closed', 'early', 'due', 'arrival', 'aforementioned', 'zombies', 'who', 'proceeded', 'eat', 'most', 'drugged', 'out', 'dance', 'fans', 'What', 'then', 'standard', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'kids', 'being', 'pursued', 'living', 'dead', 'generally', 'one', 'one', 'fall', 'victim', 'sharp', 'set', 'zombie', 'teeth', 'Luckily', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'was', 'smuggling', 'cigars', 'guns', 'plenty', 'hardware', 'embattled', 'survivors', 'utilise', 'battle', 'zombies', '.most', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'video', 'clip', 'make', 'sure', 'remember', ""'re"", 'watching', 'House', 'Dead', 'regularly', 'insert', 'screen', 'shots', 'video', 'game', 'live', 'action', 'look', 'strange', 'disjointed', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'episode', 'also', 'forgot', 'mention', 'plenty', 'Matrix', 'type', 'slo-mo', 'camera', 'work', 'levitating', 'action', 'heroes', 'bullets', 'hatchets', 'whistling', 'air', 'also', 'slow', 'motion', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'finally', 'film', 'climaxes', 'strange', 'revelation', 'entire', 'zombie', 'fraternity', 'being', 'run', '500', 'year', 'old', 'Spanish', 'sadist', '/', 'witch', 'doctor', 'who', 'constantly', 'look', 'out', 'new', 'recruits', 'decaying', 'ranks', 'FBI', 'rescue', 'survivors', 'summary', 'very', 'lack', 'lustre', 'zombie', 'genre', 'effort', 'be', 'aimed', 'audience', 'somwhere', '12-16', 'years', 'age', 'least', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'was', 'aiming', 'few', 'years', 'higher', 'weak', 'plot', 'shocking', 'characterisations', 'are', 'further', 'hampered', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'feel', 'entire', 'production', '..strictly', 'watch', 'curiosity', 'sake', 'only', 'How', 'Guide', 'how', 'NOT', 'make', 'zombie', 'film']",House Of The Dead

Altman claims House of the Dead is supposed to be an ode to the B- movie thrills and it lives up to most expectations.The film starts out as your average teen horror flick: bad twenty- something actors playing horny teens, who are on their way to a rave on a deserted island. Deserted by the living, that is, because not long after the party gets started, the boobie flashing ""teens"" (as opposed to the characters in the sexually correct late 90's horror flicks) get attacked by decaying, flesheating zombies!House of the Dead is based on the Sega video game and, unfortunately, director Uwe Boll added lots of annoying clips from that game in between scenes. This disturbs the atmosphere by reminding the viewers that it's just a movie and what they're seeing isn't real. These clips might work for superhero films, but are totally out of place in a horror movie.That, along with the not so ""B"" and overexagurated Mortal Kombat/ the Matrix/ Commando/ shoot 'em up- like fighting scene in the middle section of the film, are the only downsides to this movie.However, once that scene is over and done with, the main characters actually enter the House of the Dead and the film developes into a totally different movie with a much darker and more creepy atmosphere, especially as we find out about the sickening experiments that are at the origin of these living corpses.All in all, House of the Dead combines Lucio Fulci's setting, the Return of the Living Dead's zombies, a couple of references to George Romero's famous trilogy and lots of gore from all of the above to indeed create a very decent tribute to the 80's low budget horror movie genre, that is a must see for every fan.",3,A tribute to the 80's B- horror movies,1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,1725,"['Executive', 'producer', 'co-', 'writer', 'Mark', 'A.', 'Altman', 'House', 'Dead', 'supposed', 'be', 'ode', 'B-', 'movie', 'thrills', 'up', 'most', 'expectations.The', 'film', 'out', 'average', 'teen', 'horror', 'flick', 'bad', 'twenty-', 'something', 'actors', 'playing', 'horny', 'teens', 'who', 'are', 'way', 'rave', 'deserted', 'island', 'Deserted', 'living', 'not', 'long', 'party', 'started', 'boobie', 'flashing', 'teens', 'opposed', 'characters', 'sexually', 'correct', 'late', '90', 'horror', 'flicks', 'get', 'attacked', 'decaying', 'flesheating', 'zombies', 'House', 'Dead', 'based', 'Sega', 'video', 'game', 'unfortunately', 'director', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'added', 'lots', 'annoying', 'clips', 'game', 'scenes', 'atmosphere', 'reminding', 'viewers', 'just', 'movie', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', ""n't"", 'real', 'clips', 'might', 'work', 'superhero', 'films', 'are', 'totally', 'place', 'horror', 'movie.That', 'not', 'B', 'overexagurated', 'Mortal', 'Kombat/', 'Matrix/', 'Commando/', 'shoot', 'up-', 'fighting', 'scene', 'middle', 'section', 'film', 'are', 'only', 'movie.However', 'once', 'scene', 'done', 'main', 'characters', 'actually', 'enter', 'House', 'Dead', 'film', 'totally', 'different', 'movie', 'much', 'darker', 'more', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'especially', 'find', 'out', 'sickening', 'experiments', 'are', 'origin', 'living', 'corpses.All', 'House', 'Dead', 'combines', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'setting', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', 'zombies', 'couple', 'references', 'George', 'Romero', 'famous', 'trilogy', 'lots', 'gore', 'above', 'indeed', 'create', 'very', 'decent', 'tribute', '80', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'movie', 'genre', 'must', 'see', 'fan']",House Of The Dead

(Just watch MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE, THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS or THE CREEPING TERROR, anyone of those will make you forget of this film as the worst movie ever.) Heck, this may not even be as awful as THE SLUMBER PARTY MASSACURE 2 or EEGAH.Now, make no mistake, I am not trying to defend this film in any way. This movie is BAD. Thankfully, though, it's bad in a laughable way. It may be best enjoyed with friends who are fans of really cheesy movies and who can come up with their own improventional MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000-type commentary. I won't bother describing the plot, since chances are you've read it already in Amazon's own plot description. Instead, I'll just point out some of the things that make this such a cheese-fest: scenes that flash-cut to scenes from the video game this is supposedly based on (sometimes for no apparent reason). Zombies that have glowing red eyes. (Oooh, scary!) The fact that sometimes when a main character dies we then cut to a shot of the character standing there and the camera spinning around him or her and then the screen turns red. Then of course there's the usual things, such as wooden acting and bits of immortal dialoge. (The most famous of which would seem to be when one of the main characters asks the main bad guy,&quot;You did all this to become immortal? Why?&quot; And the response,&quot;To live forever!&quot;) The one nice thing I can say about this one is it does aknowlege George A. Romero's holy trilogy. (That's the origonal NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, DAWN OF THE DEAD and DAY OF THE DEAD for anyone who doesn't know.)Lastly, I'm not sure how the plot of the movie is suppposed to tie in with the plot of the arcade game it's based on...uh, named after. Having played through the game, I seem to remember it being about one or (if you're playing with a friend) two goverment agents who go into a mansion where a mad scientist has found a way to ressurect the dead.Finally, to sumerize: this strictly for bad movie buffs.

789073,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,B0000YEE6C,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[5, 5]","I feel sorry for Uwe Boll. Everyone basically hates him for releasingsuch garbage and ruining the videogames he takes off with (though is""ruining"" the right term? This is, after all, House of the Dead...).After watching the commentary on Alone in the Dark to hear what he hadto say for himself, I learned that Uwe Boll does not create suchterrible, terrible film out of a lack of caring or complete negligence,he really does believe in every mis-cut one-dimensional broken piece ofaction shot quipped with bad dialog he is responsible for.This movie doesn't even need to have the commentary to feel this fromhim. Immersed in all of it's terrible glory, one can still feel thelove Uwe Boll has from the camera as he misdirects scene afterhorrible, horrible scene.A rave is being held on the Isle del Muerte (and in this case Uwe Boll insults our intelligence again by actually having a character translate this to us: ""That means The Island of the Dead!""  He's the same character who states ""Sprechen Sie English?""  What a multilingual type!)  Some characters pay over a thousand dollars to get to this party (why?!?!?!), but when they get there, no one's around.  Irregardless, they go about dancing, drinking beer, sexing it up...  but despite their total lack of ability to do anything anybody normal would do, like wonder where everybody went or whatever, they get pulled into the action anyways.  Or whatever.Rain falls on a boat but never on the island.  Day and night seem to come whenever it feels like it.  Zombies are scary by putting their hands on trees and flying.  The action is either akin to that movie your younger brother shot with his friends in the woods behind the house, or it's faux-Matrixy bullet-time.  There are boobs for no good reason whatsoever, and even more pathetically, men who are around those boobs who don't go anywhere with it because they're either insane (fisherman guy), idiotic (""I have to take a piss!"") or just wimps, (""No way, the water's too cold!"").  And mixed with it all is a lot of screenshots from the game, an idea that might have worked out if Boll didn't use it to transition between scenes randomly or whatever.Good things this movie has, since it's appeal, action, continuity, editing, and dialog are terrible, are its allusions to other films... Romero gets a significant nod (what's a zombie movie without questioning whether Romero will come out with another zombie movie?), Scooby Doo, The Elephant Man, Lord of the Rings, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, they all get their respective shout-outs.It's better than Alone in the Dark.  It had one scene that was at least fun to watch, the action one outside of house.  Too bad it takes too long, being that the terrible song that plays entirely through during it ends... and a new one begins.  But it was fun to watch.  The rest of it is rather exhausting, trying to keep up with it, trying not to vomit from the absurd dialog, trying not yell at the film for wasting your time...  Meh.I could go on forever, but you have more reviews to read about it.  You know you read these reviews to hear the many various ways people hate this movie!

That's just how bad it is.I'd probably give it zero stars. The acting wasn't too bad, but there was absoulutey no drama. It's like one woman says 'I'm sorry, your best friend is dead' and they just stand there looking bored and staring into space, not one tiny morsel of sadness in thier bodies. If you've been thinking about buying this, think again. If you're tempted, turn off your computer and run, run away as far as you possibly can. This movie isn't even worth renting.

I mean how did this piece of [crud] ever find it's way into theaters? I mean this movie isn't even direct to video quality. But I don't understand where the budget went. They had millions of dollars! I mean they couldn't have spent it on getting such great actors. And the special effects pretty much sucked. So my brother and I have come to the conclusion that all of the cast and crew went to the island to shoot, but instead spent all the money on beer, got drunk and partied, right up til the day the movie was supposed to be done. So they had approximately $11 dollars to spend. That's the only logical explanation that I can find.Now if your wondering what the heck this movie is about, I'm not sure I can tell you a whole lot. All I know, is that there was a huge rave on this &quot;deserted&quot; island. So all these 20-something people arive to drink beer and party. So go figure there is a lot of pointless nudity that adds nothing to the story line. All it does is wake up a few people in the audience. Then all of a sudden, these zombies start appearing.

789077,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0000YEE6C,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 6]","House of the Dead (Uwe Boll, 2003)I have heard so many horrible things about House of the Dead, which presently holds the distinction of being one of the few movies in IMDB's bottom 100 that wasn't on Mystery Science Theater 3000, that I had to rent it. In general, I think if something is that universally reviled, it can't be all that bad. Most of the time, I'm wrong. This time, though, I wasn't.Uwe Boll, who has until now been a low-budget horror flick director (and is now specializing in videogames, helming both the upcoming films of Alone in the Dark and Bloodrayne; note, however, he is not mentioned as the director of House of the Dead 2, which is in production...), and longtime cinematographic sidekick Matthias Neumann had a chance to do something fantastic here. The potential absolutely drips from this movie. Okay, so it's your basic horror film. You have to expect at least one scene of gratuitous nudity from a character who has ""I'm going to die soon"" tattooed on her forehead. And you have to expect a decent amount of gore. And you get both, though arguably the film could have done with about ten times as much of both. What you don't expect from this type of horror film (which, despite its professional atmosphere, does have all the low-budget hallmarks about it) is some stunning camerawork. Makes me wonder what Neumann has been doing all these years when he could have been making great films. Unfortunately, the really good stuff is patchy (the early scene where the previously-nude swimmer goes into the House of the Dead, for example, is just gorgeous) and usually followed by a shot so unbearably cheesy that it's hard to keep watching.If you really need a plot summary, a group of kids charter a boat out to an island. They find it overrun by zombies. Bad things happen.Sound familiar? It should. While much is made of the influence of George Romero, both in the movie and in the DVD extras, this is most obviously a direct descendant of Fulci's classic Zombie. Let's see, you've got the boat, the kids, the eerie abandoned-looking building (I really thought it was supposed to be an abandoned church while watching the movie, still think so), the flesh-eating zombies picking everyone off one by one... yeah. Except, okay, Tisa Farrow didn't know kung fu.Not that House of the Dead will end up with the hardcore cult following of Zombie. Far from it. But you've got a bevy of beautiful babes armed to the teeth, some great makeup work on the zombies, hysterically bad videogame-esque footage intercut with scenes from the actual videogame (something for which the executive producer just short of apologized for in the DVD extras; one assumes that at least part of the funding for this came from Sega, and they were only allowed to have it with those pieces cut into the movie), and every once in a while a fantastic piece of camerawork. Just turn your brain off before you start watching, and you'll be fine. ** ",3,"If no one hates it, it's not worth listening to.",1076284800,"02 9, 2004",2004,2948,"['House', 'Dead', 'Uwe', 'Boll', '2003', 'have', 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'horrible', 'things', 'House', 'Dead', 'presently', 'distinction', 'being', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'IMDB', 'bottom', '100', 'was', ""n't"", 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'had', 'rent', 'general', 'think', 'something', 'universally', 'reviled', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'Most', 'time', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'time', ""wasn't.Uwe"", 'Boll', 'who', 'now', 'been', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'flick', 'director', 'now', 'specializing', 'videogames', 'helming', 'upcoming', 'films', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'Bloodrayne', 'note', 'however', 'not', 'mentioned', 'director', 'House', 'Dead', '2', 'production', 'longtime', 'cinematographic', 'sidekick', 'Matthias', 'Neumann', 'had', 'chance', 'do', 'something', 'fantastic', 'here', 'potential', 'absolutely', 'movie', 'Okay', 'basic', 'horror', 'film', 'have', 'expect', 'least', 'one', 'scene', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'character', 'who', ""'m"", 'going', 'die', 'soon', 'tattooed', 'forehead', 'have', 'expect', 'decent', 'amount', 'gore', 'get', 'arguably', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'about', 'ten', 'times', 'as', 'much', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'type', 'horror', 'film', 'professional', 'atmosphere', 'have', 'low-budget', 'hallmarks', 'stunning', 'camerawork', 'Makes', 'wonder', 'what', 'Neumann', 'been', 'doing', 'years', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'making', 'great', 'films', 'Unfortunately', 'really', 'good', 'stuff', 'patchy', 'early', 'scene', 'where', 'previously-nude', 'swimmer', 'House', 'Dead', 'example', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'usually', 'followed', 'shot', 'so', 'unbearably', 'cheesy', 'hard', 'keep', 'watching.If', 'really', 'need', 'plot', 'summary', 'group', 'kids', 'charter', 'boat', 'out', 'island', 'find', 'overrun', 'zombies', 'Bad', 'things', 'happen.Sound', 'familiar', 'should', 'much', 'made', 'influence', 'George', 'Romero', 'movie', 'DVD', 'extras', 'most', 'obviously', 'direct', 'descendant', 'Fulci', 'classic', 'Zombie', 'Let', 'see', ""'ve"", 'got', 'boat', 'kids', 'eerie', 'abandoned-looking', 'building', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'abandoned', 'church', 'watching', 'movie', 'still', 'think', 'so', 'flesh-eating', 'zombies', 'picking', 'everyone', 'one', 'one', 'yeah', 'okay', 'Tisa', 'Farrow', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'kung', 'fu.Not', 'House', 'Dead', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'hardcore', 'cult', 'following', 'Zombie', 'Far', ""'ve"", 'got', 'bevy', 'beautiful', 'babes', 'armed', 'teeth', 'great', 'makeup', 'work', 'zombies', 'hysterically', 'bad', 'videogame-esque', 'footage', 'intercut', 'scenes', 'actual', 'videogame', 'something', 'executive', 'producer', 'just', 'short', 'apologized', 'DVD', 'extras', 'one', 'least', 'part', 'funding', 'came', 'Sega', 'were', 'only', 'allowed', 'have', 'pieces', 'cut', 'movie', 'once', 'while', 'fantastic', 'piece', 'camerawork', 'Just', 'turn', 'brain', 'start', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fine', '**']",House Of The Dead

Rodden II,"[2, 8]","I got a chance to catch this movie on its first DVD release, and I had high hopes, since at the time, Zombie movies had not taken off sprinting like they have since the remake of Dawn of the Dead.  It seemed like a great premise for a zombie film, strand a lot of college kids on an island, and then release the flesh eaters.  But the characters were mostly stock let's-get-stoned, -drunk, -screwed, whatever, and then let's get eaten and become zombies. The actions of the characters seemed so contrived, I felt compelled to see if Roger Corman had published another book, this one called, ""How I Made 100 Zombie Movies and Never Lost a Dime""). I'm not sure why they are releasing this movie a second time to DVD, as I found the first release more than enough to put me to sleep.For very good zombie horror, watch any of the original Romero films, except for the very bland, unfrightening Land of the Dead.  Of course the remake of the Dawn of the Dead was incredibly well done.  And if you feel like squirming a bit more, try the movie Zombie (sometimes known as Lucio Fulci's Zombie 2, an homage to Romero's orignal Dawn of the Dead) for incredibly disgusting gut munching and claustraphopic feeling of being trapped on an island with the walking dead.",1,Geez - Not again,1219449600,"08 23, 2008",2008,1255,"['got', 'chance', 'catch', 'movie', 'first', 'DVD', 'release', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'time', 'Zombie', 'movies', 'had', 'not', 'taken', 'off', 'sprinting', 'have', 'remake', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'seemed', 'great', 'premise', 'zombie', 'film', 'strand', 'lot', 'college', 'kids', 'island', 'then', 'release', 'flesh', 'eaters', 'characters', 'were', 'mostly', 'stock', ""let's-get-stoned"", '-drunk', '-screwed', 'whatever', 'then', 'let', 'get', 'eaten', 'become', 'zombies', 'actions', 'characters', 'seemed', 'so', 'contrived', 'felt', 'compelled', 'see', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'had', 'published', 'book', 'one', 'called', 'How', 'Made', '100', 'Zombie', 'Movies', 'Never', 'Lost', 'Dime', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'are', 'releasing', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'DVD', 'found', 'first', 'release', 'more', 'enough', 'put', 'sleep.For', 'very', 'good', 'zombie', 'horror', 'watch', 'original', 'Romero', 'films', 'very', 'bland', 'unfrightening', 'Land', 'Dead', 'course', 'remake', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'was', 'incredibly', 'well', 'done', 'feel', 'squirming', 'bit', 'more', 'try', 'movie', 'Zombie', 'sometimes', 'known', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'Zombie', '2', 'homage', 'Romero', 'orignal', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'incredibly', 'disgusting', 'gut', 'munching', 'claustraphopic', 'feeling', 'being', 'trapped', 'island', 'walking', 'dead']",House Of The Dead

789083,A3AKPY4LXIC24O,B0000YEE6C,Ryan Costantino,"[4, 7]","this movie.  First let me say that as far as arcade shooters go The House of the Dead is top notch, fill your pockets with quarters, and blast the hell out of zombies and other such monsters, fun.  A great concept for a lightgun game.  Horror fans and even shooter fans loved it, I know I looked for it whenever I visited arcades.  So yes there was a built in fanbase surrounding the game.  At one time the concept of turning this really fun game into a movie might have been a good idea if given a proper budget and maybe even an adequate director, but alas it wasn't meant to be.Your head starts aching less than 10 minutes into this film, you start fidgeting when quick glimpses of the so called &quot;rave of the year&quot; seems to be about twenty people gyrating to something or other, with some mild interest at the quick topless shots (and I mean quick) but then it starts sucking all over again.  Then the &quot;zombies&quot; appear looking like the product of some washed out makeup artist's deep rooted hatred of Tom Savini being expressed through a Halloween paint by numbers kit.The gore is pathetic and not even remotely realistic, the actors playing zombies think they're doing a good job emulating Romero's undead, but the result is insulting at best.  However, some of the zombies can jump really far, so that's, wait no that isn't cool that's just stupid.  As for the blood, well some hardware store is missing red paint and they'd like it back.There were some good points to this film, Jonathan Cherry gets to play the Bruce Campbell look alike and damned if he don't kinda look like Ash, even the costuming seems to mirror the Evil Dead, so if any one were to do a remake of those films here's your potential new slayer of Deadites.  Also Ona Grauer (whose apparent skill in this film was fencing) was fun to look at.  Other than that this film lends a helluva lot of credence to the idea that the Horror genre is crap, which it most certainly is not.Hopefully Uwe Bol will go back to watching movies and stop making them (I'd say he's seen the Matrix at least twice). Whoever greenlighted this film, you're an idiot.  I'm sorry for the newer members of the cast as it might be hard to find parts after this.  Clint Howard and Jurgen Prochnow what happened?If you have to see every zombie movie see this one too, if not save your money for the video game that's at least a little fun.  As for movies made from video games the only one that has gotten it right so far is Resident Evil, so if you haven't seen Milla Jovovich kicking Umbrella Corp zombie ass you might want to.My sincerest apologies to George Romero, Tom Savini, Bruce Campbell, Sam Raimi, Milla Jovovich, and Capcom for even mentioning their names or properties in this review.",1,The rotten smell of...,1075680000,"02 2, 2004",2004,2762,"['movie', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'as', 'far', 'arcade', 'shooters', 'go', 'House', 'Dead', 'top', 'notch', 'fill', 'pockets', 'quarters', 'blast', 'hell', 'zombies', 'other', 'such', 'monsters', 'fun', 'great', 'concept', 'lightgun', 'game', 'Horror', 'fans', 'even', 'shooter', 'fans', 'loved', 'know', 'looked', 'whenever', 'visited', 'arcades', 'So', 'yes', 'was', 'built', 'fanbase', 'surrounding', 'game', 'one', 'time', 'concept', 'turning', 'really', 'fun', 'game', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'idea', 'given', 'proper', 'budget', 'maybe', 'even', 'adequate', 'director', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be.Your', 'head', 'aching', 'less', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'start', 'fidgeting', 'when', 'quick', 'glimpses', 'so', 'called', 'quot', 'rave', 'year', 'quot', 'be', 'twenty', 'people', 'gyrating', 'something', 'other', 'mild', 'interest', 'quick', 'topless', 'shots', 'mean', 'quick', 'then', 'sucking', 'over', 'again', 'Then', 'quot', 'zombies', 'quot', 'appear', 'looking', 'product', 'washed', 'out', 'makeup', 'artist', 'deep', 'rooted', 'hatred', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'being', 'expressed', 'Halloween', 'paint', 'numbers', 'kit.The', 'gore', 'pathetic', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'realistic', 'actors', 'playing', 'zombies', 'think', ""'re"", 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'emulating', 'Romero', 'undead', 'result', 'insulting', 'best', 'However', 'zombies', 'can', 'jump', 'really', 'far', ""n't"", 'cool', 'just', 'stupid', 'blood', 'well', 'hardware', 'store', 'missing', 'red', 'paint', ""'d"", 'like', 'were', 'good', 'points', 'film', 'Jonathan', 'Cherry', 'play', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'look', 'alike', 'damned', 'do', ""n't"", 'kinda', 'look', 'Ash', 'even', 'costuming', 'mirror', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'so', 'one', 'were', 'do', 'remake', 'films', 'here', 'potential', 'new', 'slayer', 'Deadites', 'Also', 'Ona', 'Grauer', 'apparent', 'skill', 'film', 'was', 'fencing', 'was', 'fun', 'look', 'Other', 'film', 'helluva', 'lot', 'credence', 'idea', 'Horror', 'genre', 'crap', 'most', 'certainly', 'not.Hopefully', 'Uwe', 'Bol', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'watching', 'movies', 'stop', 'making', ""'d"", 'say', 'seen', 'Matrix', 'least', 'twice', 'Whoever', 'greenlighted', 'film', ""'re"", 'idiot', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'newer', 'members', 'cast', 'might', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'parts', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'what', 'happened', 'have', 'see', 'zombie', 'movie', 'see', 'one', 'too', 'not', 'save', 'money', 'video', 'game', 'least', 'little', 'fun', 'movies', 'made', 'video', 'games', 'only', 'one', 'gotten', 'right', 'so', 'far', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'kicking', 'Umbrella', 'Corp', 'zombie', 'ass', 'might', 'want', 'to.My', 'sincerest', 'apologies', 'George', 'Romero', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Capcom', 'even', 'mentioning', 'names', 'properties', 'review']",House Of The Dead

I am a huge fan of movies and an even bigger fan of cheesy, low budget horror movies, but this thing just leaves me without words. I can't even believe that Clint Howard decided to be in it, and he's been in some winners.I wasn't expecting much, maybe an hour and a half of entertaining blood and gore, super cheesy acting, and something of a plot. I didn't get any of that. The only thing that kept me going was the sheer amazement that this thing was ever approved to be shipped out. My rats could write a more intelligent story line, and they could probably act better too.And then it happened... They decided to throw in some random shots of the video game. Being stupefied already, I think I lost several brain cells when this occurred. Now why would you do that? Someone actually thought it would be a good idea to add scenes from a dated video game, to what, enhance the movie? And then a bunch of other people agreed to it! Why??! I'm all for video games, believe me. But that was just wrong.The fact that during the intro the narrator had to describe every characters purpose in the film should say something. Instead of incorporating some kind of character building dialog, they decided to list it all out for you right in the beginning. There was the stupid one, the comic relief, and the three girls, who I can't remember what they were good for. Then all through the movie they kept trying to verify the characters descriptions at the beginning. You know, by calling the stupid one, ""stupid"", and by telling the comic relief that he was, ""goofy"". There was no comic relief and they were all stupid. And then at the very beginning they go and tell you that everyone dies. So there you go. Heck, all you need to watch is the first few minutes and you'll be all set to turn it off. You could just imagine what happens, and it would probably be more entertaining and make more sense.Oh man, and don't you know it I checked out the extras. The deleted scenes to be exact, because I couldn't even fathom what they decided was not movie material. It was bad, really bad. I mean boom mics galore and just the most awkward, brain dead acting ever.I love cheesy films, I live for them. But this movie had absolutely no cheese to it. It was just sad. Very, very sad. There are about a sea of zombie movies I would recommend instead of this one. DEAD-ALIVE, being my favorite movie of all time and then the EVIL DEAD series after that (Bruce Campbell is my hero). In fact, I don't think you can get any worse than the HOUSE OF THE DEAD.

The premis, in the hands of a better director, writers, actors, grips and just about everyone else that had anything to do with the film, may have made somthing at least watchable, but this film is so bad you have a hard time staying awake let alone being scared.The acting is just bad. The only recognizable actor is the man who plays the captian (I won't mention the actors name becouse if you'r looking for a good movie he did go watch Das Boot) other than that no noe I had seen before. And what worse they almost seem like they are setting up for a sequel, the one word in the english language that sends shivers down the spine of any horror fan.

Clint Howard's terrible performance made me think that he was Mentally Retarded.  I liked Jonathan Cherry in Final Destination 2, but he made up for it in this movie.  The best part to the movie besides the NUDITY (which there isn't much of) was when that stupid PUNK was tipped in the PORTO-POTTY.  The special effects in the movie were BADONG (thats not good).  Rotating cameras just dont cut it.  The main fight was way too ... long and boring.  All they did was kill endless hordes of zombies which looked bland.  By the way, besides the main evil professor guy who looks homosexual, the only monsters are zombies.  Anyway, back to the main fight.  Only one person dies in this fight(the special forces ...).

The acting was so bad that it leapt from the realm of disgusting to the mirthful land of comedy. I laughed myself silly through most of it. This movie makes video game acting Oscar worthy.A reviewer a few posts below mine was actually shocked by the negative reviews this movie has garnered. Why? It was a terrible film in every possible way a film can be terrible. There wasn't a single defining moment that could possibly redeem the mental rape I felt I had taken by subject myself to 90 minutes of this nonsense. I felt like a guinea pig in some twisted experiment testing the effects of forced lower standards on a human subject.Maybe I've been in a coma the last ten years or so, but from what I can remember horror films were supposed to elicit fear...horror...hence the title of the genre. Gun battles and Kung-Fu theatre quality fight scenes have no business in a scary movie. It seems everyone in the industry has Buffy-fever, feeling it's essential for the main character to be well adept in the knowledge of Asian self defense.This movie reminded me a porn movie without the porn. Take out the sex and imagine trying to sit through 90 minutes of a silly plot and acting that sounded as if the actors were reading their line from a cue card.If being a ""serious horror fan"" means having to accept this movie into the genre I love, then I hereby hand in my membership card.

This movie does not deserve a rating above zero, but being that it has to be rated anything above a 1 is too much!!!There is nothing in this movie that is good at all.  House of the Dead is actually a Sega video game, that was made into a movie.  Just watch the game while you play it, trust me it's better then this cinematic piece of garbage.  House of the Dead starts off with some young adults trying to go to an island where a wild rave is.  What they don't know is the rave has suddenly been taken over by some relentless zombie.  The party goers are warned that they should not go to the island, but they flash $1,000 bucks and the captain is willing to take them.  During the party scene you get to see some scantily clad women, and a topless woman that has nothing to do with the plot at all.  Just some senseless eye candy for the fellas.  When the young group arrive to the Rave they wonder if they missed the party and go in searching to see if they can find anyone.The action is somewhat okay, but the lines are so corny all I could do is groan.  ""Who said size does not matter"" as the captain hold his weapon of choice.  ""Mine is bigger"", officer bad actress would retort.  I told you corny lines!!! When Howard's character is trying to give one of the female characters a cross for protection her line is ""It's all right I'm on the pill"" pathetic!!!!Mixed in the story line is something weak about a slave ship.  There is this guy who wants to live forever.  He created some kind of formula for that purpose, but the downside is you will be a stupid, kung-fu fighting, quick moving zombie.When I watch a horror movie I want to see the gore, and the action behind the killings.  Folks are dying in this film but you don't see it.  This movie is not scary, its not entertaining, it's not thrilling.  The acting is terrible, the lines are corny, and the plot is simply pathetic.  Why did some of the zombies not look like zombies?  The make up team must have ran out of make up.  How is it that Kirk lights a cigarette in his boat, it's raining, then in the next shot it' not raining, and then it' raining again the shot after that? Did the rain machine malfunction?  The police woman tells Greg to come with her to hunt for zombies, and when the zombies appear she tells Greg to run.  Why hunt them if you are going to run?  Stupid, stupid, and more stupid.  I actually liked the swimming zombies.  In the actual game the zombies do swim.  One thing that was very annoying were the scenes where the actual game was included.  It was stupid, and it took away from watching the movie.

789092,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B0000YEE6C,Stuart Conover,"[1, 1]","I was recently discussing this pile of steaming garbage that Uwe Boll served up claiming it was a film. For those of you who aren't movie buffs let me first tell you a little about Uwe Boll. He's made himself famous taking video game franchises and turning them into commercial successes.For those of you who knows what kind of garbage Uwe Boll creates you may be asking how I could say that. Well FINANCIALLY all of his films have made money. Look, I don't understand it either. What anyone who has seen ANY piece of one of Uwe Boll's films knows is that he also creates films that are unbearable to watch, taking OK to good actors and making them do a good job at quite possible ruining their careers. He also ruins any video game to film translation in the process.It's amazing but because the financial portion always ends up solid he keeps getting franchises to mutilate. Let me tell you if I owned a successful gaming franchise I think I'd rather bite the bullet and not making extra money giving him the rights to film it out of pure pride for my work.Still. This isn't about Mr. Boll but about his work.As I was saying I had recently been talking about this film and he bet that not only could I NOT re-watch this film in it's entirety. (I did actually watch it through in 2004 and watched it again to create this review. Yes. I am either really brave or really stupid.) Not only could I not re-watch the film but I couldn't find one redeemable aspect to it.Well with a horrible director do we have anything redeeming? Let's go through the list.Acting? No. Only Ellie Cornell gave even a half assed performance and that was REALLY stretching it. I mean she did a decent job in Halloween 4 and 5. However she DID sign on for House of the Dead 2. Actually I can't say anything on that. I've never actually watched House of the Dead 2. I'm sure however it is that it has to be better then this one since Uwe didn't direct it but who knows. We'll see. Someday. When I get really desperate for something new to watch.Special effects? ... hah... HAH..... AHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA. Oh wow that brings tears to my eyes. So the zombie scenes mix between far out scenes of clearly poorly done zombies that morph into gameplay footage. We're not talking about a game that just came out. House of the Dead was by NO MEANS a new game when this was filmed and they still used the zombies from it IN THE MOVIE. I mean shit it looks horrible. The zombies they do show? Like I said poorly done and I believe there was a total of one almost decent headshot in the entire film. Which was ruined from being smack dab in the middle of a horrible action scene. They speed by the only decent looking headshot to instead show horrible shots panning around the actors shooting guns and mixed in with more of the game's graphics. Oh yes and the entire scene kept mixing in horrible slow motion that just looked wrong.It's hurting my brain to remember how this was filmed.So what's left. Plot? Well it was about a zombie infection that took place on an island in the middle of nowhere. Sounds exactly like it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GAME HIS COMPANY SPENT MONEY LICENSING. NOTHING. NOT A SINGLE THING. I mean the film has nothing to do with the video game aside from stealing it's name and 'special effects' which makes me wonder why they spent the money even getting it. Maybe the guys who owned the license at the time lost a bet.So apparently a group of kids missed the last boat to this giant rave and pay someone off to take them. When they get to the island they have to then walk through the forest to get to the rave and when they arrive? No one is there. Quickly we realize though that the place is ruined and covered in blood. Only one of the cast members even gives a damn.  Shortly (it feels like 3 hours) after we finally get zombies coming in and attack the crew of the boat that took them out to the island. Fortunately for all involved said crew were smuggling weapons and the rest of the film turned into a cast vs zombie mess that want to get into a house in a graveyard which they've determined is the source of the undead. Clearly the best idea.So my friend was wrong. I watched the film again. However he was also right as I can't say there was anything redeemable in the film. I mean we had a few nude shots in there for the male viewers and even those can't cast a shade on the lack of quality in this movie. I mean I remember they were there. I remember it was a raver chick. I can't remember anything past that aside from how horrible the movie is.So. I can't even recommend this for a B-Movie night for those that enjoy them. This is a pile of trash and anyone who has to watch it surely will agree that it's creator should be flogged in the streets.",1,Just so no to Boll,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,4758,"['was',

789095,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0000YEE6C,Terry Mesnard,"[2, 2]","Video game movies are a dubious section of the movie business.  After seeing movies like this one, it's amazing that video game movies continue to get greenlit.  I guess I should be thankful that isn't the case because I'm an avid gamer and I love movies.  What I don't like are movies like this...Uwe Boll is a name video game enthusiasts will have to get used to hearing in the coming years.  What started with this movie and continues with Alone in the Dark (you can see my review to see what I think of that) will include some potentionally interesting video games movies (including Hunter and Blood Rayne)...well, interesting video game movies, that is, if they weren't on Uwe Boll's hit list, which they are along with another 5 or so others.The first problem with this movie is that it was even made.  The video game itself is based on someone running through a mansion/science lab/etc and shooting anything that movies, while saving scientists who can't find their way out of a box.  It's mildly amusing as a game, not so much as a movie.  It's a game that I refer to as, ""Plot?  We don't need no stinkin' plot"" game.  To make a movie out of this seems ludicrous.  Yet here we are...So we already know the movie has no plot...well, except for teenagers at the island of the dead (wait wasn't that the plot for the Scooby Doo movie....?) at a Rave and of course zombies come running, literally running, to kill everyone until you have the band of fearless people who 1) can't act and 2) would rather have sex than deal with their worsening condition.  Got that so far?  Good.  It's so bad it's not even campy.  And I have a fondness for campy horror movies.Well, does the movie have action?  At least Uwe Boll can entertain me with some cool action.  Video game movies don't have to be Oscar worthy performances (Resident Evil proved that) as long as they have action.  Well, there's action...but is it exciting?  Not in the least.  In fact, in order to help cement the fact that this IS truly based on the video game, Uwe Boll was nice enough to include very pixilated scenes from the first video game!  How nice!  It's as if he's saying ""See, this scene was in the game, aren't I clever?""In an interview, Uwe Boll discussed how excited he was at including a matrix-y shot involving a camera spinning around an individual while he or she shoots their shotgun.  Amazing!  We get to see a 360 degree turn around a character!  Score!  Worth my 8 bucks alone!I know I'm being overtly sarcastic about this movie.  I've already spent more words on this movie than it warrants.  It's just a horrible, horrible film.  It has no redeeming value.  There's no plot, there's no exciting action, the acting is absolutely horrible, and the characters are just robots for all we could care.  It's not even funny.  If it doesn't have anything, why is it here?Depending on how you look at it, there is a shining light at the end of this tunnel of bores...however much your brain hurts from watching it, at least your fingers won't be tired because this atrocity does not come with a light gun.",1,Wish I could give it a 0 star rating...,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,3084,"['Video', 'game', 'movies', 'are', 'dubious', 'section', 'movie', 'business', 'seeing', 'movies', 'one', 'amazing', 'video', 'game', 'movies', 'continue', 'get', 'greenlit', 'guess', 'should', 'be', 'thankful', ""n't"", 'case', ""'m"", 'avid', 'gamer', 'love', 'movies', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'are', 'movies', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'name', 'video', 'game', 'enthusiasts', 'will', 'have', 'get', 'used', 'hearing', 'coming', 'years', 'What', 'started', 'movie', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'can', 'see', 'review', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'will', 'include', 'potentionally', 'interesting', 'video', 'games', 'movies', 'including', 'Hunter', 'Blood', 'Rayne', 'well', 'interesting', 'video', 'game', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'hit', 'list', 'are', 'along', '5', 'so', 'others.The', 'first', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'video', 'game', 'based', 'someone', 'running', 'mansion/science', 'lab/etc', 'shooting', 'anything', 'movies', 'saving', 'scientists', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'way', 'box', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'game', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'game', 'refer', 'Plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'stinkin', 'plot', 'game', 'make', 'movie', 'ludicrous', 'here', 'are', 'already', 'know', 'movie', 'plot', 'well', 'teenagers', 'island', 'dead', 'wait', 'was', ""n't"", 'plot', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'movie', 'Rave', 'course', 'zombies', 'come', 'running', 'literally', 'running', 'kill', 'everyone', 'have', 'band', 'fearless', 'people', 'who', '1', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', '2', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'sex', 'deal', 'worsening', 'condition', 'Got', 'so', 'far', 'Good', 'so', 'bad', 'not', 'even', 'campy', 'have', 'fondness', 'campy', 'horror', 'movies.Well', 'movie', 'have', 'action', 'least', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'can', 'entertain', 'cool', 'action', 'Video', 'game', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performances', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'proved', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'action', 'Well', 'action', 'exciting', 'Not', 'least', 'fact', 'order', 'help', 'cement', 'fact', 'IS', 'truly', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'was', 'nice', 'enough', 'include', 'very', 'pixilated', 'scenes', 'first', 'video', 'game', 'How', 'nice', 'saying', 'See', 'scene', 'was', 'game', 'are', ""n't"", 'clever', 'interview', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'discussed', 'how', 'excited', 'was', 'including', 'matrix-y', 'shot', 'involving', 'camera', 'spinning', 'individual', 'shoots', 'shotgun', 'Amazing', 'get', 'see', '360', 'degree', 'turn', 'around', 'character', 'Score', '8', 'bucks', 'alone', 'know', ""'m"", 'being', 'overtly', 'sarcastic', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'already', 'spent', 'more', 'words', 'movie', 'warrants', 'just', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'film', 'redeeming', 'value', 'plot', 'exciting', 'action', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'robots', 'could', 'care', 'not', 'even', 'funny', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'why', 'here', 'Depending', 'how', 'look', 'shining', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'bores', 'however', 'much', 'brain', 'hurts', 'watching', 'least', 'fingers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'tired', 'atrocity', 'not', 'come', 'light', 'gun']",House Of The Dead

I was one of the zombies in the sequel which was a painful and interesting experience.  More on this later.  Anyway, the first movie is not the best zombie flick out there.  Action isn't too bad, but the forced tie in with the video game is ridiculous.  The movie would of been much better without the video game clips placed throughout the movie.  This is a definate B-movie.  The second one, I worked on as an extra during the last day of shooting.  As far as I know, this movie is probably as campy as the first.  The zombie invasion happens on a college campus, shot at Occidental College in Glendale, CA.  There was a lot of night time shooting during December which was grueling because it was so cold being outdoors and it was a 16 hour day of filming, and with all the makeup on my face and hands and the bad tasting black ooz the make up crew periodically places in my mouth, it was a hard night.  Other than the discomfort, make up wasn't too bad.  The action scenes look pretty decent.  Two of the principle actors, the heroes, are dressed up like Lara Croft wannabees.

789104,A96JD9312DHWC,B0000YEE6C,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[3, 3]","Picture this: The biggest rave of the year is about to start on a island in the middle of nowhere, complete with the party lights and ladies and all the alcoholic trimmings you can ingest, and you're invited. All you have to do is get yourself and your friends to a boat departing for it by 5:00, strap on your party privies, and go all out.Now picture this: You arrive at the dock, find the place a little on the empty side while you're waiting for the three ladies you're with to arrive, and that's when you figure out that you've missed your ticket to play by all of fifteen minutes. So you know you need to get there, even if you have to charter a fishing boat with a questionable two-man crew and getting there after the initial celebration kickoff.Now picture that, but with a horror movie twist: When you arrive, you find everything in order, all the stuff still standing and waiting and blinking those neon blinks you envisioned, but the people that should be accompanying them are nowhere to be found. All you find are bloody tatters forecasting a probability that disaster has taken place, and you also notice the other not-quite living and not-quite-dead things traveling keeping the stuff company as well.Its sad to say this in retrospect, but this movie really had the potential to be something entertaining. It had a basis that was build on the ever-giving blood and violence some many love to partake in, enough commercial backing to actually make money with the project and to spawn sequels if it were done correctly, and something of a schematic to draw on. All a director really had to do was take the plotline to the zombie shooter, change it around so it would work outside of the videogame arena, and then go to town with all the ideas they could dream up. Add to that the fact that the ""House of the Dead"" videogame series were widely known, that the trailers for the film said that this would be worth watching, and you had yourself a ballgame. Unfortunately, all of that made me think I should see it, that it might be good because I have always been a sucker for zombie movies (even some pretty bad ones), and that this might fit into the new trend to make horror bigger and better. Yes, what could go wrong?Everything.Instead of being a movie that was scary or funny or something shoved somewhere in-between, House of the Dead simply started out as a bad piece of cinema and ended as a well-rounded diet of annoying and tiresome. Not only did it sport a cast that didn't seem to understand the meaning of the word ""acting,"" but the way the zombies worked in this film and some of the mechanics of the directors vision (if we can call it that) were tiresome.First, the zombies were something that went beyond being disposable, with them somehow managing to slaughter droves of people without so much as a sign left in the initial (and not shown, to make matters all-the-more boring) struggle but still being fragile enough to be take out with kicks, bullets to the arms or legs, and even the occasional panic-hurled jar.Next, there were the occasional shots of the wonderfully-aged videogame that appear for absolutely no reason and take up space in moments that were supposed to be both cryptic and dramatic and worth wathcing. Sometimes, when zombies were being shot, the all-too-human monsters and their exploding heads would be replaced with a pixelated image (and a bad one at that) of a zombie, some slash marks made by it, and a ""1st Player, press start"" icon in the corner.After that, there were the forced portions of the movie that tried to work in zombies and action but did none of the above with any clarity, the scenes of the rave of the year that didn't look like much of a party, and the interaction of completely worthless characters as they struggled to survive. Yes, the party of the year seemed to consist of one stage, a bar, some tents and beanbags, and an island with a score or two of party-people. It was then visited by five people, some additional weight they brought with them, and some cops that didn't make me want them to live or die; their actions as rigid as some of the zombies. And did I mention the horrible plot and the ""outhouse of doom"" that was, for some reason, supposed to be scary (and a laboratory) to boot?Perhaps, had the movie not been hyped to be good, I could have forgiven it and I could have laughed. I actually like quite a few Italian movies with zombies that aren't that effect-prone, and I like many of the Trouma releases despite their lack of budgets. I can even go as far as to say that I enjoy movies that look like they were shot on camcorders from time to time. The thing I couldn't forgive in this is that it pitched itself to be something it wasn't, causing me to think I'd missed something when I skipped it at the movies when I hadn't. Added to that, the DVD features are meaningless; with 3 deleted scenes, some storyboard ""could have been"" scenarios, a little ""how we made our cheap monsters move"" skit, and commentary. At least the nudity in the beginning, all be it a short drive down ""swimming topless in a thong"" lane, was nice. That's the only thing keeping it out of the one-star gutter.",2,Zombies and the Plot That Flew South for the Winter,1075161600,"01 27, 2004",2004,5185,"['Picture', 'biggest', 'rave', 'year', 'start',

'Bad' is not enough; 'Terrible' is too kind; my choice is 'Atrocious' which I am afraid is not strong enough to fully convey the truths about the wretched film and my miserable feelings after watching it.Yet another TV-game based film that does not know what it wants to do, 'House of the Dead' shows the bloody battles between the zombies and the teenagers, plus a few middle-aged actors who should have read the script before singing on.  Anyway, the plot is just a standard one, about the five young Americans who join in the secret party held on an isolated island, as you see a wild party going on, which is apparently sponsored by SEGA Company, who provided the zombie-hunting game, basis of this film.[NO IMAGINATION AT ALL]  There is nothing new or innovative about this Agatha Christie-meets-Down of the Dead story, but that's OK with me.  More damaging thing about 'House of the Dead' is that the film director Uwe Boll seems to have no sense of storytelling, thrills (cheap ones or not), or even humor.  The film freewheels exactly like a TV game you're watching over someone else's shoulders, and as if we don't know its origin, Uwe Boll repeatedly inserts the cuts from the TV games between the film's action scenes, reminding us of the fact that after more than 10 years, some film producers are no wiser than when they were making 'Super Mario Brothers.'But most shocking part is the inclusion of Clint Howard and Jurgen Prochnow, both having been in more respectable films in the past.  Prochnow even allows one character to make fun of his being in 'Das Boot,' a parody that he should have refused.

What I like about this zombie movie is that is different from any other zombie movie I've seen so far. I've seen all the George Romero zombie movies: Day of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead etc. I've also seen the Resident Evil movies but they are different than this one. Like Resident Evil, this one is also based on a famous video game. Most of the shooting scenes are in slow motion and they take you back to the game itself. It is as if you were playing the game yourself but in real life. It feels like that. Somewhere in the shooting scenes they will show a shooting scene of the game itself. This makes the movie different. It keeps reminding you of the actual game itself. The zombies here are more alive and faster as well. They are still dumb but they are a little faster and more active-- and they use weapons as well.  I would say the zombie makeup is not very impressive but it's still good. There is a lot of zooming in and camera angle rotations. This makes the zombies more scary by showing all their face features real closely. That's kind of cool. I would say the special features are good and the location as well. The environment suits and connects the movie with the game itself. It takes place in an island somewhere in the Caribbean.

This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen.Now, there are good videogame based movies out there. Like ""Mortal Kombat"", ""Resident Evil"", and ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"". Being an 8 year fan of the game, I was happy to hear that they made a movie off of it, but after I saw it I was just pissed. It was hoping it would be good like the three I listed, but no. Instead Uve Boll decides to have lots of stupid shots involving some rotating platform. That really killed the action scenes. The acting, seemed like an other cheesy movie like those in the zombie movies of the 60's, 70's, and 80's. However, the dialogue was pitiful. ""We need to get out of here, and check the rest of this house."" Meaning we need get out of this house, and check the rest of this house.Now, the story is pitiful, but I don't care. A story is not what makes a good movie. Entertainment does, but this fails to be entertaining. The only thing I liked was that chick that went topless in the beginning.The only part I liked was the ending because they brought in the charaters Rogan and G, who are from the game, as well as the AMS team.Now, let me say something I've always believed in. When you get the right to do a movie based off of something such as: a book, a game, a comic book, an old movie, that means you have the right to take ideas from this thing you're basing the movie off of and put it in the movie. Such as I, Robot. Not alot like the book, but it took ideas. The Dawn remake. Took the same ideas.  It never said it was an adaption. It said it was based off a screenplay by that terrible director George Romero. So stop complaining when it's not exactly like whatever it is it's based off of.Incase you don't know, they're making a sequal. Yeah... a sequal.Hey. Where are all those people to say this is a rip off of that crappy ""28 Days Later""?By the way. I'm tired of people saying bad things about the swimming zombies.

He kept watching for my reactions during the film and I had to put on the best act of my life.  I wanted to bash the DVD player in the whole time it was playing.  I kept making excuses to leave the room, and then I would keep asking ""Did Liberty die yet?, did Liberty die yet?  Finally she did and that was the most monumental thing in the entire movie.
