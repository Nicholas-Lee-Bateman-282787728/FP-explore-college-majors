This is not a horror tale like ""The Grudge"" but rather, a psychological thriller with a romantic twist. It is nice to see Lee Pace in a different light, away from the ""Pushing Daisies"" persona. Sarah Michelle Gellar also did a tremendous job in this little known flick.The plot is good and it is rare to find a film which deals with this kind of story.

Ms. Gellar is quite good as always, this time as Jess, the wife of the world's most attentive husband, Ryan (Michael Landes from FINAL DESTINATION 2). Ryan writes love letters and gives Jess roses every day! He whispers sweet nothings in her ears and buys her jewelry every ten seconds or so! Yep, he's perfect! All is well in the couple's cozy love-nest except for their house-guest, Ryan's eeevil, violent brother, Roman (Lee Pace from THE FALL). This uncomfortable triangle is blown apart when Ryan and Roman are in a car accident that leaves them both in a coma. Oh no! Icky Roman regains consciousness, while wonderful Ryan remains vegetative! To make matters worse, Roman now claims to be Ryan, and says / does all those cutesy things that his brother did! Poor Jess! Of course, there's a twisty story involved, and things just might not be as they seem. Though there is mystery and a bit of suspense, POSSESSION does drag in places, making it feel longer than it needs to be.

1239076,A23UGT76JP6PVX,B001UJUGZY,Gotham Night,"[23, 27]","Jess and her husband, Ryan, have it all.  A great marriage, a beautiful home, and she is a successful lawyer.  Life is good - until Ryan's prodigal brother, Roman, is jailed for assault and is now out on parole.  He has to stay with his brother and his wife during his probation period, but he and Ryan are like night and day.  Ryan loves his brother and wants to support him despite his violent background and bad attitude.  Roman is not beyond redemption, he just had a bad past relationship with his father and doesn't know how to deal with his anger and resentment.  Jess does not like Roman, he frightens her, and she wants him out of the house.  Ryan cannot throw his own brother out after all he's been through.  Roman overhears their argument one day regarding this and leaves on his own, his belongings in trash bags slung over his shoulder as Jess looks on.  She calls Ryan and tells him Roman has left the house.  Roman is not supposed to leave the state.  Ryan says he is going to return home immediately and as he is crossing the Golden Gate bridge, he is trying to call his brother Roman, unaware that Roman is on that very same bridge heading right toward him from the opposite direction.  The fog is thick, Roman is driving recklessly and as he passes a car, his own brother is in his path and they collide.  Moments later they are both laying on the road, unconcious and badly injured.  They are taken to the hospital and put in the same room together, still unconcious, their faces badly bruised, so much so that Jess cannot tell which man is her husband.And therein lies the rub, as they say, in this suspenseful thriller starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lee Pace, and Michael Landes.  It is a story about love, loss, loyalty, redemption, deception, second chances, and forgiveness.  This film goes a lot deeper into the human psyche than most thrillers normally do.  It asks, `Can love heal all past hurts?'  It also confronts the viewer with the question - `Can one become so lonely and wracked with grief over the loss of a loved one that your morality and all that you believe in can be disregarded in order to have the comfort of love once again?'Lee Pace is heartbreakingly wonderful in the role of Roman and Sarah Michelle is very believable as the wife who is caught in the middle of the emotional relationship between the two brothers.  My only wish is that the directors and producers had the guts enough to use the alternative ending shown in the special features instead of the ending used in the actual film.  But I guess I can applaud them for even considering such a thought provoking alternative ending to this movie, because it certainly deserved it.  It leaves you wondering what you would do in Jess' place.  I recommend this mainly for Lee Pace's heartfelt performance.  Without his acting ability, it would have been a mediocre movie at best.  I highly recommend ""Possession"".",5,Possessed by this movie,1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,2915,"['Jess', 'husband', 'Ryan', 'have', 'A', 'great', 'marriage', 'beautiful', 'home', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'Life', 'good', 'Ryan', 'prodigal', 'brother', 'Roman', 'jailed', 'assault', 'now', 'out', 'parole', 'stay', 'brother', 'wife', 'probation', 'period', 'Ryan', 'are', 'night', 'day', 'Ryan', 'brother', 'support', 'violent', 'background', 'bad', 'attitude', 'Roman', 'not', 'redemption', 'just', 'had', 'bad', 'past', 'relationship', 'father', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'anger', 'resentment', 'Jess', 'not', 'Roman', 'house', 'can', 'not', 'throw', 'own', 'brother', 'been', 'Roman', 'argument', 'one', 'day', 'regarding', 'own', 'belongings', 'trash', 'bags', 'slung', 'shoulder', 'Jess', 'Ryan', 'Roman', 'left', 'house', 'Roman', 'not', 'supposed', 'leave', 'state', 'Ryan', 'going', 'return', 'home', 'immediately', 'crossing', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'bridge', 'trying', 'call', 'brother', 'Roman', 'unaware', 'Roman', 'very', 'same', 'bridge', 'heading', 'right', 'opposite', 'direction', 'fog', 'thick', 'Roman', 'driving', 'recklessly', 'car', 'own', 'brother', 'path', 'collide', 'Moments', 'later', 'are', 'laying', 'road', 'unconcious', 'badly', 'injured', 'are', 'taken', 'hospital', 'put', 'same', 'room', 'together', 'still', 'unconcious', 'badly', 'bruised', 'so', 'much', 'Jess', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'man', 'husband.And', 'therein', 'rub', 'say', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'starring', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'Michael', 'Landes', 'story', 'love', 'loss', 'loyalty', 'redemption', 'deception', 'second', 'chances', 'forgiveness', 'film', 'lot', 'deeper', 'human', 'psyche', 'most', 'thrillers', 'normally', 'do', 'Can', 'love', 'heal', 'past', 'hurts', 'also', 'viewer', 'question', 'Can', 'one', 'become', 'so', 'lonely', 'wracked', 'grief', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'morality', 'believe', 'can', 'be', 'disregarded', 'order', 'have', 'comfort', 'love', 'once', 'again', ""'Lee"", 'Pace', 'heartbreakingly', 'wonderful', 'role', 'Roman', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'very', 'believable', 'wife', 'who', 'caught', 'middle', 'emotional', 'relationship', 'two', 'brothers', 'only', 'wish', 'directors', 'producers', 'had', 'guts', 'enough', 'use', 'alternative', 'ending', 'shown', 'special', 'features', 'instead', 'ending', 'used', 'actual', 'film', 'guess', 'can', 'applaud', 'even', 'considering', 'thought', 'provoking', 'alternative', 'ending', 'movie', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'Jess', 'place', 'recommend', 'mainly', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'acting', 'ability', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'best', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Possession']",N/A

They give everything away in a very short time. The movie itself is only a little over 80 minutes long.
