1261680,A2A7NHE5HTK79N,B002C07AU4,"J. Lovins ""Mr. Jim""","[54, 58]","Tales of Wells Fargo is an American Western television series that ran from March 18, 1957 to June 2, 1962 on NBC --- Set in the mid-1800s, the series starred Dale Robertson as special agent Jim Hardie, noted at the time as ""the left-handed gun"". The concept of the Wells Fargo series, a company troubleshooter in the American West --- Produced by Revue Productions, the series aired in a half-hour format until its final season when it expanded to an hour --- For its first two years, the show was also in the top ten Nielsen Ratings. During the 1957-58 season, it was ranked No. 3. --- Check out 46 Classic Episodes on 6 DVD Discs with some of the best character actors in the business.Dale Robertson, the actor who made his name in television Westerns in the 1950s and '60s, was born on July 14, 1923, in Harrah, Oklahoma. After serving in a tank crew and in the combat engineers in North Africa and Europe during World War II, the twice-wounded Robertson started his acting career while still on active duty in the U.S. Army. While stationed at San Luis Obispo, California, had a photograph taken for his mother. A copy of the photo displayed in the photo shop window attracted movie scouts, and the six foot tall, 180-lb. Roberson soon was on his way to Hollywood. Will Rogers Jr., whose father is the most famous son of Oklahoma, told him to avoid formal training and keep his own persona""Don't ever take a dramatic lesson,"" Rogers told him. ""They will try to put your voice in a dinner jacket, and people like their hominy and grits in everyday clothes."" Robertson took his advice and avoided acting classes.Robertson was typecast in Western movies and TV shows when the genre was still America's favorite. He headlined two TV series, ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" (1957), in which he played the roving trouble-shooter Jim Hardie, and ""The Iron Horse"" (1966), in which he won a railway in a poker game. He also served as one of the hosts, along with Ronald Reagan, of the syndicated series ""Death Valley Days"" (1952) during the 1960s. Robertson later appeared in the inaugural season of ""Dynasty"" (1981).Inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1983 --- Robertson is a recipient of the Golden Boot Award in 1985 --- He is retired on a ranch near Oklahoma City, not far from his birthplace of Harrah.

Like meeting an old friend that you've not seen for years. Dale Robertson was perfect for the part and his voice over narration at beginning and end of show adds class and substance to the episodes. The man knew how to ride a horse. And a handsome mount they gave him to work with. About half way through the 40 odd episodes and have enjoyed everyone. And is a real kick to see actors performing in these episodes that went on to stardom in later years.The only gripe I would have is the current $60 price for the boxed set. I bought it at a significant price reduction a few weeks back from Amazon and am well pleased with the value received. However before the temporary, it seems, reduction, I was hesitant to expend the funds and had ""saved for later"" in my cart for several months. Not saying it's not worth the current price, because I think it is, but it was sure a great deal at the lower one.",5,Great rendition of above average classic TV western series,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,988,"['Recalled', 'enjoying', 'series', 'when', 'saw', 'back', 'when', 'Bought', 'am', 'super', 'pleased', 'meeting', 'old', 'friend', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'years', 'Dale', 'Robertson', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'voice', 'narration', 'beginning', 'end', 'show', 'class', 'substance', 'episodes', 'man', 'knew', 'how', 'ride', 'horse', 'handsome', 'mount', 'gave', 'work', 'half', 'way', '40', 'odd', 'episodes', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'everyone', 'real', 'kick', 'see', 'actors', 'performing', 'episodes', 'went', 'stardom', 'later', 'only', 'gripe', 'would', 'have', 'current', '60', 'price', 'boxed', 'set', 'bought', 'significant', 'price', 'reduction', 'few', 'weeks', 'back', 'Amazon', 'am', 'well', 'pleased', 'value', 'received', 'However', 'temporary', 'reduction', 'was', 'hesitant', 'expend', 'funds', 'had', 'saved', 'later', 'cart', 'several', 'months', 'Not', 'saying', 'not', 'worth', 'current', 'price', 'think', 'was', 'sure', 'great', 'deal', 'lower', 'one']",Tales of Wells Fargo Best of the First 5 Seasons SET!
