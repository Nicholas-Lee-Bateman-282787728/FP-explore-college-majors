The exterior box is just that... a box. It's not a slipcase as is common with dvd box sets, one literally has to open the side of the box and close it every time. That combined with the flimsy cardboard that the box is made of results in crumpling, wrinkling, and tearing... all of which would be unnecessary if any thought whatsoever had gone into the packaging design.

What does make them different, however, is that they feel the need to correct their boredom by altering what the viewers (their customers) have come to love. Imagine if the people at McDonalds decided to change the meat recipe because they were ""bored"". I doubt the customer would approve.And I don't approve here.Season 13 is nothing like season 1 or 2 or anything up to 11 (where I feel it really started to go down hill). It isn't just that the writers have decided to start every episode with overdrawn, unrelated plot setups, but the characters are not even the same any more. Watch a few episodes from seasons 1 or 2 and compare that Homer to one you will see in season 13. Homer used to be pleasantly naive, now he's 'Three Stooges"" stupid. He used to be a big lovable boob who cared about his family, now he's a jerk. Not even Lisa, that pinnacle of elitist humor, has escaped being turned into a absurd fool. Now ever member of the family finds themselves getting involved in the most absurd, unrealistic scenarios that one can imagine. The Simpons used to have their adventures camping, now they have them while competing in obscure Olympic sports? What happened?What truly disappoints me is the political satire. The Simpsons used to be subtle, clever. Their quick comments only meant something to those who were actually engaged, and they made fun of everyone! No one was safe. Now, every political comment is as obvious as a Code Pink protester, and virtually every political crack is reserved for Republicans. When did the writing staff staff start drinking Democratic Kool-Aid? I don't want yellow cartoons telling me who to vote for! I just want them to make me laugh, and apparently they can't do that anymore.The final things I have to say about the ""new"" simpsons is that the Simpsons Movie is proof positive that the writers still can write a funny, well developed, endearing story.

The erratic quality of the show began about 1999, but there were still many great episodes produced in that time. Season 13 (which aired between 2001/2002) isn't a bad season, as a matter of fact it has mostly brilliant episodes, but the episodes which ARE bad, are among the worst ever, and drag the rest of it down.Of the 22 episodes featured about 18 get a 4-star rating. A couple get 2 or three stars, and the worst of the bunch...get minus infinity. First of all, the episode 'Gump Roast' is a cheap clip show. I think it's appalling that 13 years into a billion-dollar cash cow they thought it was still acceptable to churn out a half-assed episode filled with recycled animation, mostly of things that weren't funny first time around. The other bad one is 'The Lastest Gun in the West', starring Dennis Weaver as a old-time cowboy. Weaver's heart isn't in it, his voice is completely wrong for the character, and the story of the episode itself is grim and depressing. Really not funny. I can't stress enough how utterly awful these two are. The writers try to cover it up with self-referential, depreciating humor, but it doesn't, and never has, worked. They use this cheap trick time and time again and I wish they'd focus more on making a better show than trying to jokingly cover-up their failings by wearing them on their sleeve.But, like I said, the remaining 18 are well-written, have smart stories, and loads of great humor. Where else would you learn that Otm Shank is the biggest star in India? It's just a shame that two bad shows reduced the overall rating to 3/5.The Blu Ray looks great in 1.33:1 1080p, with DTS HD-MA sound. I wish Fox would release all the early seasons on BD, but in order to upgrade the picture they'd have to re-edit every episode digitally from scratch, as the were edited in video-quality before, and would not hold up well in HD.

When we complained about Season 20, they release Season 13 with the same packaging. It's almost like they're going out of their way to make things worse.

1348274,A19552QR80XTOX,B003KZ27N0,Jungle Red,"[2, 2]","I hesitated writing this review because, while I love The Simpsons, I'm not in love with them anymore. I don't want to be yet another fan wailing into the ether, ""What the hell happened to The Simpsons?"", but yet here I am. Seriously, what happened to this show? It used to be so damn good! Memorable lines, hilarious plots, guest stars that were more than just the flavor of the minute, smart yet stupid humor - it was pretty damn perfect. So perfect that I memorized all the requisite lines and rarely missed an episode. Then Season 12 aired and something changed (some say the decline happened sooner). The feel of the show changed and I stopped watching new episodes around that time. In fact, I haven't sat through an entire new episode in over six years. I chalked it up to me being an old fogey (I did start watching the show when I was in junior high after all), and moved on.Despite my waning love for The Simpsons, I still remembered to good times we shared so I bought the DVD sets when they were released. I have nearly every season on DVD up to Season 12 (I never really enjoyed season 1 so I never bothered to buy it). After watching the same episodes from Seasons 2-12 repeatedly over the years, I got a little restless and wondered if perhaps I was being too harsh in my judgement of the newer episodes. So I caved and bought Season 13 and 14 a week ago.Since I haven't watched the show in years, a lot of the episodes from Season 13 are brand new to me. After watching them over the course a few days, I agree with other reviews that this is a pretty average season. There's not one episode that truly stands out. I think some of the stronger episodes in the season are ""The Blunder Years"", ""Jaws Wired Shut"", and ""Half Decent Proposal"". The weaker ones like ""A Hunka Hunka Burns In Love"" just didn't work for me because Mr. Burns isn't a strong enough character to sustain an entire episode (we get it, he's old and weak), ""The Frying Game"" was just irritating and ""Tales From the Public Domain"" reminds me of ""Simpsons Tall Tales"" which was only mildly funny. I actually didn't mind ""Gump Roast"" because Simpsons clip shows are usually pretty good (with the exception of ""Another Simpsons Clip Show""...ugh), and the song ""They'll Never Stop the Simpsons"" was funny (and evidently true).As for the packaging, that's been covered by many here too. I have nothing of real substance to add except to say that yeah, it is horrendous and annoying. I think whomever designed the packages for the newer seasons is trying too hard to be inventive when they should just stick to the classic, non-scratchy design.

1348278,ATSOWPQ1N12WX,B003KZ27N0,"mafiaboy ""josh""","[1, 12]","I am writing this review to not just comment on the episodes but, to shed a little light on a long argument between fox broadcasting and consumer. I have seen most of these episodes, they are for the most part memorable The parent Rap is my favorite I love the spoof on judge Judy. My second most would have to be when Homer gets his jaws wired shut mainly because it reminds me a little of the first two seasons where they put sap into many episodes. This season will most likely be one of the last I buy, mainly because the show starts to fizzle and the writers try way too hard to be funny. Now that I have taken part in my consumer report on how I feel about the season I would like to throw my 2 cents in about packaging. I know it sucks I completely agree with every person that has complained about it but, I also understand a few things for instance Fox is nothing but a big corporation it's common sense people whatever saves them money on packaging is a plus for them it most likely does not take more than a few bucks to make this junk anyway. If they make it look 3D and can slap a collector's label on it to make a few extra bucks, well then they are doing what big corporate does, No matter how many people whine and cry about how value goes down on their 2 cents worth of plastic there is some big corp. guy that will turn down the little people, and that's another thing the value will most likely never be seen in this lifetime why? you may ask because they are mass produced, stores are flooded with these seasons you will not see value for a long time and I highly doubt anyone would be so anal as to keep their collection in mint that long when they finally do show value. The best thing to do is to suck it up, accept what most likely will not change and enjoy what you pay for after all it is only entertainment I state that in most of my recent views because I notice how people are taking things way too seriously these days. No one should let entertainment control their life.",4,All I can say is wow,1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,2001,"['am', 'writing', 'review', 'not', 'just', 'comment', 'episodes', 'shed', 'little', 'light', 'long', 'argument', 'fox', 'broadcasting', 'consumer', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'memorable', 'parent', 'Rap', 'favorite', 'love', 'spoof', 'judge', 'Judy', 'second', 'most', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'when', 'Homer', 'jaws', 'wired', 'shut', 'mainly', 'little', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'where', 'put', 'sap', 'many', 'episodes', 'season', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'one', 'last', 'buy', 'mainly', 'show', 'fizzle', 'writers', 'try', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'Now', 'have', 'taken', 'part', 'consumer', 'report', 'how', 'feel', 'season', 'would', 'like', 'throw', '2', 'cents', 'packaging', 'know', 'completely', 'agree', 'person', 'complained', 'also', 'understand', 'few', 'things', 'instance', 'Fox', 'nothing', 'big', 'corporation', 'common', 'sense', 'people', 'saves', 'money', 'packaging', 'plus', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'take', 'more', 'few', 'bucks', 'make', 'junk', 'anyway', 'make', 'look', '3D', 'can', 'slap', 'collector', 'label', 'make', 'few', 'extra', 'bucks', 'well', 'then', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'big', 'corporate', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'whine', 'cry', 'how', 'value', 'down', '2', 'cents', 'worth', 'plastic', 'big', 'corp.', 'guy', 'will', 'turn', 'down', 'little', 'people', 'thing', 'value', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'lifetime', 'why', 'may', 'ask', 'are', 'mass', 'produced', 'stores', 'are', 'flooded', 'seasons', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'value', 'long', 'time', 'highly', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'anal', 'keep', 'collection', 'mint', 'long', 'when', 'finally', 'do', 'show', 'value', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'suck', 'up', 'accept', 'what', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'not', 'change', 'enjoy', 'what', 'pay', 'only', 'entertainment', 'state', 'most', 'recent', 'views', 'notice', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'taking', 'things', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'days', 'one', 'should', 'let', 'entertainment', 'control', 'life']",The Simpsons: Season 13

1348280,A3ATD1VNKRQ23C,B003KZ27N0,Mr. Howell,"[9, 19]","We witnessed The Simpsons losing steam last season (S12); As we enter season 13, it is painfully obvious that the producers have abandoned the tried and true techniques which made the earlier seasons such masterpieces of Hollywood history. Gone is the wit and intelligent humor; Gone is the satire and parody of contemporary American culture; Gone are the memorable quotes and most of all, gone is the laughter. In their place are plot-driven cartoon dramas, reminiscent of your average live-action sit-com, with dull humor which appears to be aimed the lowest common denominator (as if the producers felt that anything witty or intelligent would be far above the heads of their intended audience and offend them).Whereas previously, you could watch Simpsons episodes countless times and still laugh and enjoy them and even find things you had missed in the previous 30 viewings, with this new crop of crud, you watch the episode and are bored immediately, and have no desire to ever re-watch them, because once you have seen the story (the drama which has replaced all the jokes) you've seen all that there is to see.Perhaps the producers felt that if they had continued on in the footsteps of previous seasons, that they would grow stale; but there was nothing wrong with that formula, as it did not even seem formulaic, as it always managed to generate interest and enjoyment and contained many levels so that the show was appropriate for every demographic group; but in departing from what had made the show so beloved and great, they have made the show one-dimensional and formulaic, and have removed all satire and intelligence, and all the little references to obscure things and the jokes that only a percentage of the audience would ""get"" but which would keep that percentage coming back for more, because this had been the only TV show to offer us such treats.In addition to the show itself, the quality of the commentaries has also seriously declined. With the previous seasons, I'd enjoy the commentaries as much as the show itself, and would watch them every time I watched the corresponding episode....but now, it seems the commentaries consist largely of cast and crew members sitting around watching the episodes and laughing at them (at what, I don't know) and occasionally making a semi-relevant comment or observation.The packaging, as with the previous season, is abhorrent and ridiculous, and seems to suggest that this DVD set is a disposable item. I formerly felt no shame in admitting that I- a 48 year-old man- was a fan of a cartoon.....but I would never want to admit to watching this stale witless garbage which is season 13. Not that I was expecting too much with S13, as I had heard that the quality decreased markedly- but as one who does not watch TV, purchasing these DVDs was the only way I could view previously unseen episodes. I had looked forward to seeing these virgin (to me) episodes which I'd never before seen, but as I quickly came to observe: The magic is gone and we are left with just another bland empty sitcom. Somewhere before this season, The Simpsons jumped the shark. The show has become as bad as the cheap packaging in which it now comes. :(",1,Where Did The Comedy Go?,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,3196,"['witnessed', 'Simpsons', 'losing', 'steam', 'last', 'season', 'S12', 'enter', 'season', '13', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'producers', 'have', 'abandoned', 'tried', 'true', 'techniques', 'made', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'such', 'masterpieces', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'Gone', 'wit', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'Gone', 'satire', 'parody', 'contemporary', 'American', 'culture', 'Gone', 'are', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'most', 'gone', 'laughter', 'place', 'are', 'plot-driven', 'cartoon', 'dramas', 'reminiscent', 'average', 'live-action', 'sit-com', 'dull', 'humor', 'be', 'aimed', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'producers', 'felt', 'anything', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'heads', 'intended', 'audience', 'offend', 'previously', 'could', 'watch', 'Simpsons', 'countless', 'times', 'still', 'laugh', 'enjoy', 'even', 'find', 'things', 'had', 'missed', 'previous', '30', 'viewings', 'new', 'crop', 'crud', 'watch', 'episode', 'are', 'bored', 'immediately', 'have', 'desire', 'ever', 're-watch', 'once', 'have', 'seen', 'story', 'drama', 'replaced', 'jokes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'see.Perhaps', 'producers', 'felt', 'had', 'continued', 'footsteps', 'previous', 'seasons', 'would', 'grow', 'stale', 'was', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'formula', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'seem', 'formulaic', 'always', 'managed', 'generate', 'interest', 'enjoyment', 'contained', 'many', 'levels', 'show', 'was', 'appropriate', 'demographic', 'group', 'departing', 'what', 'had', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'beloved', 'great', 'have', 'made', 'show', 'one-dimensional', 'formulaic', 'have', 'removed', 'satire', 'intelligence', 'little', 'references', 'obscure', 'things', 'jokes', 'only', 'percentage', 'audience', 'would', 'get', 'would', 'keep', 'percentage', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'had', 'been', 'only', 'TV', 'show', 'offer', 'such', 'treats.In', 'addition', 'show', 'quality', 'commentaries', 'also', 'seriously', 'declined', 'previous', 'seasons', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'commentaries', 'as', 'much', 'show', 'would', 'watch', 'time', 'watched', 'corresponding', 'episode', '.but', 'now', 'commentaries', 'consist', 'largely', 'cast', 'crew', 'members', 'sitting', 'watching', 'episodes', 'laughing', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'occasionally', 'making', 'semi-relevant', 'comment', 'observation.The', 'packaging', 'previous', 'season', 'abhorrent', 'ridiculous', 'suggest', 'DVD', 'set', 'disposable', 'item', 'formerly', 'felt', 'shame', 'admitting', 'I-', '48', 'year-old', 'man-', 'was', 'fan', 'cartoon', '..but', 'would', 'never', 'want', 'admit', 'watching', 'stale', 'witless', 'garbage', 'season', '13', 'Not', 'was', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'S13', 'had', 'heard', 'quality', 'decreased', 'markedly-', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'watch', 'TV', 'purchasing', 'DVDs', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'view', 'previously', 'unseen', 'episodes', 'had', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'virgin', ""'d"", 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'quickly', 'came', 'observe', 'magic', 'gone', 'are', 'left', 'just', 'bland', 'empty', 'sitcom', 'Somewhere', 'season', 'Simpsons', 'jumped', 'shark', 'show', 'become', 'as', 'bad', 'cheap', 'packaging', 'now']",The Simpsons: Season 13

But since I need to in order to leave this review, I'm giving it 1 star, because I predict it will have the new packaging the last few seasons have had. I love the Simpsons and was never able to catch it when its being aired so I'm always excited when a new season is released to dvd.However, given the way the last few seasons have been packaged, I would recommend the everyone holding off and seeing if they've fixed the packaging issue before spending (wasting)$30 on it. The last few season have been packaged in an accordion style box that makes removing/inserting the disks very difficult and almost always ends up in resulting in a scratch on the disk every time its used. My solution for the last season I bought ( I stopped buying it after season 10) was to store the disks in separate cases, but the amount of room required to do this over and over and over again for me isn't worth it. You can call fox at 310-369-1000 and ask for the Simpsons department and leave your thoughts there on voicemail, if you share my sentiments, but they don't seem to care enough about the fans to bother returning calls or acknowledge the feedback given to them.I will wait to see the newer reviews left about the packaging and let that determine whether or not I purchase this season.

1348295,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B003KZ27N0,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[13, 15]","Ever since season 9 there have been complaints from the fans about what they see as a decline in quality of The Simpsons. I'm sorry but I have to agree, I love the earlier Simpsons episodes and seasons but that doesn't mean the latter ones don't have any value. Actually I still find enjoyment in watching the show even today but you can't just ignore that the show is not as good as it once was, and that' being objective. I loved the first 9 seasons, 10-12 are still good to me, season 13 less so but is still watchable.  Season 13 definitely has some good moments and provides laughs. As it turns out, I enjoy those episodes much more now than I did when they initially aired. The thing is, after so many seasons it gets incredibly hard for a television show to stay fresh and keep all viewers happy, season 13 struggles with this. I like season 13, I do not LOVE it like I did earlier season but that's normal, I'm just glad it's still watchable and entertaining. There's no real problem, a show changes and sometimes it's not as good as it once was. No one is forcing you those buy anything as far as I'm concerned.Some episodes I particularly enjoyed from season 13 were ""A Honka Honka Burns In Love"" which had Mr. Burns falling in love, the three story episode ""Tales From The Public Domain"" was particularly a good and clever one in my opinion, and ""I Am Furious Yellow"" in which Bart makes a comic based on Homer called ""Angry Dad"" and gets successful. I thought this season's Halloween episode was average, the Harry Potter story was a great one thought. Interesting to note, this season brought back Homer and Ned's Las Vegas wives and Marge's admirer Artie Ziff, also from this season on the Halloween shows would not be shown in October but rather in early November. I don't hate any episodes in season 13, for a letter season there's plenty of good in it, I'm just being objective an expressing my feelings towards this season (please don't see this as bashing!). If seasons of the show are still being released on DVD there must be fans who want them right?Now an issue I feel is important to address; the packaging. The first season of The Simpsons was first released on DVD in 2001, since then they've kept coming and now, in 2010 season 13 was recently released. The history of the packaging seems to interest many here but the reality is that it is not all about packaging, there's the content as well. Season 6 introduced the ""limited edition"" character set, there is also the regular edition of season 13, this year it's Ralph that's on the cover (One has to wonder who's next? Bumblebee man or Kent Brockman perhaps?). Season 11 introduced bad packaging; season 12 continued this trend but season 13 aims towards perfecting the art of bad packaging.At this point if you're obviously going to have an opinion about the quality of the show, good or not. There are good episodes in this season and the show is still worth watching if you're a fan. If you can live with the fact that it's not as good as some of the previous season, and the packaging that comes with it, I bet you'll find plenty to like from season 13. 3/5.",3,Still something for Simpsons fans to enjoy,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,3142,"['Ever', 'season', '9', 'have', 'been', 'complaints', 'fans', 'what', 'see', 'decline', 'quality', 'Simpsons', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'have', 'agree', 'love', 'earlier', 'Simpsons', 'episodes', 'seasons', ""n't"", 'mean', 'latter', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'value', 'Actually', 'still', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'show', 'even', 'today', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'ignore', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'once', 'was', 'being', 'objective', 'loved', 'first', '9', 'seasons', '10-12', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'season', '13', 'less', 'so', 'still', 'watchable', 'Season', '13', 'definitely', 'good', 'moments', 'laughs', 'out', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'much', 'more', 'now', 'did', 'when', 'initially', 'aired', 'thing', 'so', 'many', 'seasons', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'television', 'show', 'stay', 'fresh', 'keep', 'viewers', 'happy', 'season', '13', 'struggles', 'season', '13', 'do', 'not', 'LOVE', 'did', 'earlier', 'season', 'normal', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'still', 'watchable', 'entertaining', 'real', 'problem', 'show', 'changes', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'once', 'was', 'one', 'forcing', 'buy', 'anything', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned.Some', 'episodes', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'season', '13', 'were', 'A', 'Honka', 'Honka', 'Burns', 'Love', 'had', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'falling', 'love', 'three', 'story', 'episode', 'Tales', 'Public', 'Domain', 'was', 'particularly', 'good', 'clever', 'one', 'opinion', 'Am', 'Furious', 'Yellow', 'Bart', 'comic', 'based', 'Homer', 'called', 'Angry', 'Dad', 'successful', 'thought', 'season', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'was', 'average', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'one', 'thought', 'Interesting', 'note', 'season', 'brought', 'back', 'Homer', 'Ned', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'wives', 'Marge', 'admirer', 'Artie', 'Ziff', 'also', 'season', 'Halloween', 'shows', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'shown', 'October', 'rather', 'early', 'November', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'episodes', 'season', '13', 'letter', 'season', 'plenty', 'good', ""'m"", 'just', 'being', 'objective', 'expressing', 'feelings', 'season', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'bashing', 'seasons', 'show', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'must', 'be', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'right', 'Now', 'issue', 'feel', 'important', 'address', 'packaging', 'first', 'season', 'Simpsons', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'DVD', '2001', 'then', ""'ve"", 'kept', 'coming', 'now', '2010', 'season', '13', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'history', 'packaging', 'interest', 'many', 'here', 'reality', 'not', 'packaging', 'content', 'as', 'well', 'Season', '6', 'introduced', 'limited', 'edition', 'character', 'set', 'also', 'regular', 'edition', 'season', '13', 'year', 'Ralph', 'cover', 'One', 'wonder', 'who', 'next', 'Bumblebee', 'man', 'Kent', 'Brockman', 'perhaps', 'Season', '11', 'introduced', 'bad', 'packaging', 'season', '12', 'continued', 'trend', 'season', '13', 'aims', 'towards', 'perfecting', 'art', 'bad', 'packaging.At', 'point', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'going', 'have', 'opinion', 'quality', 'show', 'good', 'not', 'are', 'good', 'episodes', 'season', 'show', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', ""'re"", 'fan', 'can', 'live', 'fact', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'season', 'packaging', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'find', 'plenty', 'like', 'season', '13', '3/5']",The Simpsons: Season 13

Anyway, Season 13 is a long awaited release, as we got Season 20 for the 20th anniversary.  Al Jean took over as show-runner, who is still in that position today, although he is no longer doing this (at this point) with Mike Reiss.  Lots of people say this season (maybe not 13 specifically...say the 12-15 area) is where the quality of the show started to decline.  I am diehard Simpsons fan.  I have seen every episode, many times.  I own every season, and the movie, that is available.  Now, Season 13 is certainly a time of change, but while the show is changing, I don't think that the quality has changed necessarily.  We see more episodes that have two (or sometimes even a third) plot or story.  An ""A"" and a ""B"" story, if you will.  One thing you do see happen often in these latter seasons is that the ""B"" story that is supposed to be the subplot, is more exciting or interesting the main plot.  The Simpsons still today, and in Season 13 do things very well.  They can still entertain better than anything on television.  They are still able to touch your heart in more ways than one.Below is a list of the episodes with brief tidbits :)Treehouse of Horror XII--There's a Gypsy story here, a ""smart house"" with Pierce Brosnan, and a Harry Potter spoof this year.The Parent Rap--A solid episode with Homer and Bart being tethered together until Marge frees them.  The judge then decides Bart only acts out because of Marge and Homer being poor parents.Homer the Moe--This is one of the gems of this season in my opinion.  Moe returns to bartender school after losing the passion for his work.  He completely renovates his bar leaving Homer and the rest of the regulars feeling out of place, prompting Homer to open a bar in his garage...guests R.E.M.A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love--This episode is both funny, and fairly emotional.  I always really tend to enjoy episodes that feature heavily on Mr. Burns.  Homer gets a job writing fortune cookie fortunes, one which leads Mr. Burns to love, unfortunately to Snake's (ex)girlfriend.The Blunder Years--This episode has a few good laughs, but is mediocre overall.  Homer sees a hypnocist and relives a tragedy from his childhood, that for some reason ties into Smithers and Mr. Burns...She of Little Faith--Bart and Homer destroy the Church with a rocket which prompts Mr. Burns to buy and sponor the rebuilding.  Lisa becomes fed up with this and begins exploring other religions, eventually deciding to be Buddhist.Brawl in the Family--This is not only the worst episode of the season, but one of the worst of the whole show.  Homer and Ned's Vegas Wives return, and the family gets arrested while having a fight break out while playing a board game...Sweets and Sour Marge--Here's another magnificent episode.  Homer and the town are trying to get themselves into the Guiness Book of World Records, which they do, but for being the worlds fattest town.  Marge, doing her humane duty, bans sugar in Springfield, causing Homer to start boot-legging the goods into town.Jaws Wired Shut--Homer accidentally runs into a statue of Drederick Tatum and break his jaw.  Dr. Hibbert puts head and mouth gear on him that completely leaves him unable to talk, or eat essentially.  He becomes a great loving, listening, and compassionate father.  However, Marge is bored when Homer heals and doesn't revert to his old self.Half-Decent Propsal--Another mediocre episode this season, Artie Ziff, for one weekend, gets Marge to stay with him, for $1 million (if I recall correctly) to pay for home repairs.  Artie recreates the senior prom and forces himself on Marge, and Homer thinks she doesn't want him anymore.The Bart Wants What It Wants--Bart ends up in a relationship with Rainer Wolfcastle's daughter, Gretta.  He blows her off for a date and they break up, leading her to a sympathy relationship with Milhouse, leading the Simspons to Canada.  Principal Skinner works on coffeehouse/bar stand-up comedy, a la Seinfeld.The Latest Gun in the West--Bart and Lisa befriend an old TV actor, who was a cowboy.  They arrange for him to have a comeback special on Krusty's show, but turns out Buck is an alcoholic, who ends up shooting Krusty on live TV.The Old Man and the Key--Grandpa uses Homer's car to woo women but they are only using him for his ability to drive, as he is warned by Homer and Marge.Tales From the Public Domain--Shows like this I usually don't enjoy, Homer finds a years overdue library book, and reads Simpson style parodies of the Odyssey, Joan of Arc, and Hamlet.Blame it on Lisa--The pun in the title might be the most humourous part of this episode.  I may be wrong, but didn't Rio de Janerio sue the Simpsons and/or Fox for how the place was portrayed?  Anyway, the family visits this place as Lisa looks for an orphan.Weekend at Burnsie's--Homer after picking a fight with a murder of crows has his eyes pecked, and Dr. Hibbert prescribes him medical marijuana.  This leads Homer to become Burns' Vice President from always laughing at his jokes while high.  Meanwhile, the town votes on whether or not to ban medical marijuana.Gump Roast--Another clip show, which is just a roast of Homer.  Kang and Kodos make an appearance, and Maggie saves the day.  The end actually is rather touching.I am Furious Yellow--After seeing an assembly, Bart creates a comic that stars Homer, which becomes an ultra-popular internet cartoon.  Guest Stan Lee as himself, who harasses the Comic Book Guy.The Sweetest Apu--A reasonably sentimental episode (eventually) as Homer and Marge discover Apu having an affair with the Squishee lady, until Manjula finds out by watching the Kwik-E-Mart security tapes.Little Girl in the Big Ten--Lisa befriends some college students, and begins leading a double life while still going to Springfield Elementary, and attending Springfield Community College.  Meanwhile, Bart gets bitten by a chinese mosquito and must live for a week in a bubble.The Frying Game--Homer buys Marge a coi pond, which neither of them knows, contains a rare ""Screamapillar"" which Homer kills, or so he thinks, and obviously is unable to care for.  Homer and Marge get sentenced to care for an elderly woman, who is murdered, with them as the prime suspects.Papa's Got a Brand New Badge--Season finales are usually hit or miss, here we have a bullseye.  During a blackout, Homer, Lenny, and Carl become Spring-Shield, a police force, that Mayor Quimby lets replace the police.  All is well, and Homer is even good at this, until Fat Tony steps into play.In short, I'll be buying this set, along with every other season, as I figure all true fans will.  Take my review for what you will.",5,Season 13,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,6757,"['First', 'off', 'rating', 'should', 'really', 'be', '4.5', '5', 'half', 'star', ""n't"", 'really', 'option',
