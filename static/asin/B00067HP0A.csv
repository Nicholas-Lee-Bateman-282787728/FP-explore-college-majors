This dvd has different options/premixes you can choose from (like Cathe's dvds).Workout Options (noted on back of DVD):-Complete Circuit (56 min)-this is the one I am reviewing-Cardio Circuit (32 min)-Strength Circuit (32 min)-A La Carte Segments (""If you're short on time, the A La Carte menu brings you straight to the segments you want most"")-time not noted. This is most likely where you can choose exactly what parts to do from the whole dvd. :)I love Karen Voight and I own many of her workouts. I like that her step and aerobics are not too complicated or dancey which is why I often choose her workouts to do for the day!The warm up is nice and not too long. The step is more basic than Cathe's so its easy to follow if you are not new to step. If you are new to step, then you may need to rewind a few times, but the steps are very easy to follow just after the 1st try. I felt like the step circuit combos went by really fast. They weren't too high impact to me, but more of a good solid intermediate. You can always modify by using a higher inch step (I used a 6 inch and still got a good workout).The weight segments weren't too long, but she works them well considering the short amount of time you are working them. I felt the burn really good with the shoulder segment! :)The abs segment and short lower body (done on the step) were also very good and challanging. Time flew by really fast with this one! Her cuing was off a few times which is only why I gave it 4 stars, but it wasn't too bad where you couldn't keep up. ;) Remember, if you are a Cathe fan, then you would know that her step is way more complicated and sometimes it would take me 4 times of doing the workout until I really could follow without having to stop and rewind! ;)Overall solid A and great workout. I felt refreshed and not out of breath with this one but still felt a great burn!",4,Very good workout!,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,1919,"['review', 'only', 'complete', 'workout', 'dvd', 'different', 'can', 'choose', 'Cathe', 'dvds', '.Workout', 'Options', 'noted', 'back', 'DVD', '-Complete', 'Circuit', '56', 'min', '-this', 'one', 'am', 'reviewing-Cardio', 'Circuit', '32', 'min', '-Strength', 'Circuit', '32', 'min', 'La', 'Carte', 'Segments', ""'re"", 'short', 'time', 'A', 'La', 'Carte', 'menu', 'straight', 'segments', 'want', 'most', 'not', 'noted', 'most', 'likely', 'where', 'can', 'choose', 'exactly', 'what', 'parts', 'do', 'whole', 'dvd', 'love', 'Karen', 'Voight', 'own', 'many', 'workouts', 'like', 'step', 'aerobics', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'complicated', 'dancey', 'why', 'often', 'choose', 'workouts', 'do', 'day', 'warm', 'up', 'nice', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'step', 'more', 'basic', 'Cathe', 'so', 'easy', 'follow', 'are', 'not', 'new', 'step', 'are', 'new', 'step', 'then', 'may', 'need', 'rewind', 'few', 'times', 'steps', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'just', '1st', 'try', 'felt', 'step', 'circuit', 'combos', 'went', 'really', 'fast', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'high', 'impact', 'more', 'good', 'solid', 'intermediate', 'can', 'always', 'modify', 'using', 'higher', 'inch', 'step', 'used', '6', 'inch', 'still', 'got', 'good', 'workout', '.The', 'weight', 'segments', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'well', 'considering', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'are', 'working', 'felt', 'burn', 'really', 'good', 'shoulder', 'segment', 'abs', 'segment', 'short', 'lower', 'body', 'done', 'step', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'challanging', 'Time', 'flew', 'really', 'fast', 'one', 'cuing', 'was', 'few', 'times', 'only', 'why', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'Remember', 'are', 'Cathe', 'fan', 'then', 'would', 'know', 'step', 'way', 'more', 'complicated', 'would', 'take', '4', 'times', 'doing', 'workout', 'really', 'could', 'follow', 'having', 'stop', 'rewind', 'Overall', 'solid', 'great', 'workout', 'felt', 'refreshed', 'not', 'breath', 'one', 'still', 'felt', 'great', 'burn']",Karen Voight: Ultimate Step Circuit

Or she does it when she is already in the next move which is a little bit confusing for me. I think this is a very fun workout once you learn the moves, and Oh my! I sweat like crazy!The strength training is very complete, but I don't like that you have to use a step mat which I don't have.I wasn't too crazy about the stretch part, which in my opinion was hard to do and too short.

Karen is such an instructor.  She is such a clear cuer and talks ahead of the next move so you know what's comming up.This workout alternates fast cardio intervals with toning moves.  They are tough but worth it.  The aerobic intervals are between 7-9 minutes and each one gets a little tougher.  The toning segments are shorter but work multi muscle groups.  There is a great workout for the abs that will kill.  You'll need for the workout some dumbells, and a lot of energy.  This is a great workout to do often as you will definately get the results you want.

862731,A20J4FB33G3X4X,B00067HP0A,Reviewer,"[10, 11]","The first time I tried this video, I was extremely annoyed - her cuing is absolutely awful on this one.  She tells you what she's doing next as she already starts doing it - no warning at all!  So the first couple times I did this video, I cursed her the whole time.  However, once I got it down, I realized that it is a really good, high-impact workout.  I have a lot of step videos, and this one keeps my heart rate higher than any of the rest.  It is really fast-paced, as other reviewers have mentioned.  You're definitely stepping quicker than in most other step videos, and the routines are strenuous, with a lot of jumps - however, you can usually substitute lower impact moves if you don't prefer to do the jumps.  As for the weight section, if you do it in conjunction with the step portions, it is somewhat difficult, because your heart rate gets up pretty high and then you go right into weight lifting - this makes the weight lifting parts seem hard because you're already huffing and puffing, but on their own, I don't feel like I get a good total body weight lifting workout from this video.  Some of the body parts are only worked on for a few minutes, and in moves that don't seem like they're doing much for me.  I recommend this video more for the step aerobics than for the weight portion.",5,"Works your nerves at first, but overall a great workout",1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,1308,"['first', 'time', 'tried', 'video', 'was', 'extremely', 'annoyed', 'cuing', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'one', 'what', 'doing', 'next', 'already', 'doing', 'warning', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'did', 'video', 'cursed', 'whole', 'time', 'However', 'once', 'got', 'down', 'realized', 'really', 'good', 'high-impact', 'workout', 'have', 'lot', 'step', 'videos', 'one', 'heart', 'rate', 'higher', 'rest', 'really', 'fast-paced', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', ""'re"", 'definitely', 'stepping', 'quicker', 'most', 'other', 'step', 'videos', 'routines', 'are', 'strenuous', 'lot', 'jumps', 'however', 'can', 'usually', 'substitute', 'lower', 'impact', 'moves', 'do', ""n't"", 'prefer', 'do', 'jumps', 'weight', 'section', 'do', 'conjunction', 'step', 'portions', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'pretty', 'high', 'then', 'go', 'right', 'weight', 'lifting', 'weight', 'lifting', 'parts', 'seem', 'hard', ""'re"", 'already', 'huffing', 'puffing', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'get', 'good', 'total', 'body', 'weight', 'lifting', 'workout', 'video', 'body', 'parts', 'are', 'only', 'worked', 'few', 'minutes', 'moves', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', ""'re"", 'doing', 'much', 'recommend', 'video', 'more', 'step', 'aerobics', 'weight', 'portion']",Karen Voight: Ultimate Step Circuit

I bought it because I was hoping that I'd get a great step workout from an instructor that brings a lot of positives to the field of video exercise.  Unfortunately, there's only about 30 minutes of stepping and even when I chose the option where you do all the step segments at once, I couldn't hit my target heart rate for long enough to make it worthwhile.
