The movie portrays her attempts to hold on to the family home (her sister and fiance want to sell it) whilst learning to be responsible and changing as a person.The movie is light hearted with some genuinely funny moments, (Frannie and the pigs), pathos, and drama.

When I saw the title and read the short blurb in the movie description, and being fans of Farrah, my wife and I decided to watch it.  We liked it.  It had a plot, character developement, and good dialogue.  We were disappointed in the accident scene as we felt it did not seem to picture the extent of the inuury.  One person's character was transparent enough that both my wife and I guessed ahead of time about him. The story also showed how motive and a goal can change a person such as wanting to keep the farm kept Frannie to her task.  And she falls in love to boot.  It is a decent movie and one we would recommend to anyone who wants to watch and enjoy a wholesome movie and is also a fan of Farrah's.  This review is based on the  movies shown on TV.",5,Better than Expected,1103500800,"12 20, 2004",2004,780,"['liked', 'movie', 'When', 'saw', 'title', 'read', 'short', 'blurb', 'movie', 'description', 'being', 'fans', 'Farrah', 'wife', 'decided', 'watch', 'liked', 'had', 'plot', 'character', 'developement', 'good', 'dialogue', 'were', 'disappointed', 'accident', 'scene', 'felt', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'picture', 'extent', 'inuury', 'One', 'person', 'character', 'was', 'transparent', 'enough', 'wife', 'guessed', 'ahead', 'time', 'story', 'also', 'showed', 'how', 'motive', 'goal', 'can', 'change', 'person', 'such', 'wanting', 'keep', 'farm', 'kept', 'Frannie', 'task', 'love', 'boot', 'decent', 'movie', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'wholesome', 'movie', 'also', 'fan', 'Farrah', 'review', 'based', 'movies', 'shown', 'TV']",N/A

I liked the evolution of Fawcett's character, you gathered that she had been and still was, to an extent, conflicted, but evolved to be quite genuine and likeable. I loved the warmness and sensitivity portrayed by Brad Johnson's character (the strong, yet sensitive male).  Bottom line the movie was wholesome, man, woman, love.....  I even liked the theme song, I think it's called ""Carolina Skies"".  Anyone know where I can get a copy?",4,Wholesome,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,564,"['liked', 'movie', 'entire', 'family', 'could', 'watch', 'change', 'was', 'nudity', 'profanity', 'etc.', 'thank', 'goodness', 'liked', 'evolution', 'Fawcett', 'character', 'gathered', 'had', 'been', 'still', 'was', 'extent', 'conflicted', 'evolved', 'be', 'quite', 'genuine', 'likeable', 'loved', 'warmness', 'sensitivity', 'portrayed', 'Brad', 'Johnson', 'character', 'strong', 'yet', 'sensitive', 'male', 'Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'was', 'wholesome', 'man', 'woman', 'love', '..', 'even', 'liked', 'theme', 'song', 'think', 'called', 'Carolina', 'Skies', 'Anyone', 'know', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'copy']",N/A
