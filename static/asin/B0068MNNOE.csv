And while it is well-done, it lacks the coherency and definitive persuasiveness one would hope such a film possessed.What this movie deserves praise for is its superb acting, especially by Joely Richardson and Vanessa Redgrave, expanse art direction, well-crafted script, fantastic sets that transform the audience into Elizabethan London, and plenty of action and intrigue.The film starts, surprisingly, in modern-day New York City, with a narrator leading us to question Who Was Really Shakespeare? It loses some of that tremendous creative goodwill, by tackling the Prince of Tudor subplot, which states that Shakespeare was Queen Elizabeth I's son (and, later, her lover, although she was unaware of the fact that their relationship was incestuous) -- the movie this loses credibility. It's almost as if Emmerich is too afraid to profess his belief that Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford was Shakespeare, and must masquerade such belief behind an elaborate plot that will be liked by the Hollywood masses expecting a good, entertaining story and nothing more.",3,"entertaining movie that is meant for Hollywood, not for an academic discussion",1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,1163,"['someone', 'fascinated', 'Authorship', 'Question', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'well-done', 'coherency', 'definitive', 'persuasiveness', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'film', 'movie', 'praise', 'superb', 'acting', 'especially', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'expanse', 'art', 'direction', 'well-crafted', 'script', 'fantastic', 'sets', 'transform', 'audience', 'Elizabethan', 'London', 'plenty', 'action', 'intrigue.The', 'film', 'starts', 'surprisingly', 'modern-day', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'narrator', 'leading', 'question', 'Who', 'Was', 'Really', 'Shakespeare', 'tremendous', 'creative', 'goodwill', 'tackling', 'Prince', 'Tudor', 'subplot', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'son', 'later', 'lover', 'was', 'unaware', 'fact', 'relationship', 'was', 'incestuous', 'movie', 'credibility', 'almost', 'Emmerich', 'too', 'afraid', 'profess', 'belief', 'Edward', 'de', 'Vere', '17th', 'Earl', 'Oxford', 'was', 'Shakespeare', 'must', 'masquerade', 'such', 'belief', 'elaborate', 'plot', 'will', 'be', 'liked', 'Hollywood', 'masses', 'expecting', 'good', 'entertaining', 'story', 'nothing', 'more']",Anonymous

While scholars are never able to prove with any solid evidence precisely who this other man was, many believe the most likely candidate was Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Anonymous aims to dramatize this angle, dressing the story up in political conspiracy, romantic intrigue, and the power struggles of the Elizabethan elite. And who better to bring you this story than... Roland Emmerich? The guy who did Stargate, Independence Day, and 2012? Yes, that Roland Emmerich. And while the film is horrible, I felt it certainly could have been much worse.

I was in love with it since the trailer. When I saw the movie, everything went even better than expected. I'm not an avid Shakespeare fan, et cetera, so it was easy to think of this as a theory, however entertaining, however flawed, without opening myself up to personal offense. You have to admit it: the movie was interesting. The costumes and makeup were great. The special effects were neat. I'm not exactly the most cultured person in the world, but I could still follow the story and even I found it very interesting. I don't see movies three times and then buy the DVD if they're run of the mill.My review is on its entertainment value, which I PERSONALLY rate FIVE STARS.It was a well put-together story, ALL HISTORY ASIDE. If you think Shakespeare wrote his stuff, good for you. If you think he didn't, fabulous. Get together and go have a soda; no need to get religious about it on Amazon.

1513379,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0068MNNOE,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 7]","So, if you are looking for an authenticated look at Shakespeare, look elsewhere.  This is a film that is obviously manipulated in many areas and serves for mere entertainment value at best.  It becomes apparent about halfway through that they aren't even trying to be logical here, but are merely trying to stir up controversy at every corner because that will keep people glued to the seats.  Sadly, the horrific acting almost made me want to get up and leave.`Anonymous' raises doubt to the authenticity of Shakespeare's fame.  This is a theory that has been around for years.  In fact, in school we debated this in Litt. Class and so I was well aware with the idea that Shakespeare himself didn't actually pen those epic plays that serve as the basis for so many of what we see and read today.  In `Anonymous', those beautiful stories were penned by a prominent figure, the Earl of Oxford, who hid his love of poetry from those closest to him out of shame.  Raised in a household that forbid the arts, Edward de Vere (the Earl) was constantly battling his paternal figures until a scandal trapped him in a life he didn't necessarily desire.  Decades later, and he is searching for an outlet for his life's passion, and he finds that outlet in a young aspiring playwright named Ben Jonson.  Ben, reluctant to brandish his name to the works of the Earl, is taken aback when his friend William Shakespeare steals the credit and becomes an overnight sensation.  While the film could have easily focused on the plays themselves and the controversy surrounding their author, it wants to encompass more than that and so soon we are divided between this story and that of Queen Elizabeth's successor, or the pursuit of one.  The two are obviously interwoven in a way that feels oddly soap operatic by film's end, and the scandalous twists that are thrust at us in the finale are an obvious ploy at `one upping' Shakespeare himself.It tries too hard.Overall, this was interesting conceptually, but it wasn't entirely handled with care.  It gets choppy and a little lazy in the way that things are tied together, and the cast is atrocious here, outside of Rhys Ifans, who is enticing and compelling and heartfelt in his every delivery.  Vanessa Redgrave, whom I love, is oddly uneven here.  Sebastian Armesto tries far too hard to add gravel to his voice and sounds like an idiot.  Rafe Spall is repulsive.  Jamie Campbell Bower is oddly effeminate and acts like a little boy, which is unbecoming considering the man he is playing.  Joely Richardson pulls out her inner Cate Blanchett, and not the good kind, and basically overacts EVERYTHING.  I mean, this is like a cesspool of performances that makes me cringe the more I think of it.  But yes, Rhys Ifans might make my top twelve Supporting Actor ballot for 2011, he was that good (and that out of place here).The film is beautiful to look at and rightfully garnered a Costume nomination at the Oscars, but the absurdity of the film's final plot lines and the performances contained make this a semi-mockery of a film.I should have known Roland Emmerich would drop this ball!",3,An interesting concept gets muddled along the way...,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,3122,"['So', 'are', 'looking', 'authenticated', 'look', 'Shakespeare', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'film', 'obviously', 'manipulated', 'many', 'areas', 'serves', 'mere', 'entertainment', 'value', 'best', 'apparent', 'halfway', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'trying', 'be', 'logical', 'here', 'are', 'merely', 'trying', 'stir', 'up', 'controversy', 'corner', 'will', 'keep', 'people', 'glued', 'seats', 'Sadly', 'horrific', 'acting', 'almost', 'made', 'want', 'get', 'up', 'leave.', 'Anonymous', 'doubt', 'authenticity', 'Shakespeare', 'fame', 'theory', 'been', 'years', 'fact', 'school', 'debated', 'Litt', 'Class', 'so', 'was', 'well', 'aware', 'idea', 'Shakespeare', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'pen', 'epic', 'plays', 'that', 'serve', 'basis', 'so', 'many', 'what', 'see', 'read', 'today', 'Anonymous', 'beautiful', 'stories', 'were', 'penned', 'prominent', 'figure', 'Earl', 'Oxford', 'who', 'hid', 'love', 'poetry', 'closest', 'shame', 'Raised', 'household', 'forbid', 'arts', 'Edward', 'de', 'Vere', 'Earl', 'was', 'constantly', 'battling', 'paternal', 'figures', 'scandal', 'trapped', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'desire', 'Decades', 'later', 'searching', 'outlet', 'life', 'passion', 'outlet', 'young', 'aspiring', 'playwright', 'named', 'Ben', 'Jonson', 'Ben', 'reluctant', 'brandish', 'name', 'works', 'Earl', 'taken', 'aback', 'when', 'friend', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'credit', 'overnight', 'sensation', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'focused', 'plays', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'author', 'encompass', 'more', 'so', 'soon', 'are', 'divided', 'story', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'successor', 'pursuit', 'one', 'two', 'are', 'obviously', 'interwoven', 'way', 'feels', 'oddly', 'soap', 'operatic', 'film', 'end', 'scandalous', 'twists', 'are', 'thrust', 'finale', 'are', 'obvious', 'ploy', 'one', 'upping', 'Shakespeare', 'himself.It', 'tries', 'too', 'hard.Overall', 'was', 'interesting', 'conceptually', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'handled', 'care', 'choppy', 'little', 'lazy', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'cast', 'atrocious', 'here', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'who', 'enticing', 'compelling', 'heartfelt', 'delivery', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'whom', 'love', 'oddly', 'uneven', 'here', 'Sebastian', 'Armesto', 'tries', 'far', 'too', 'hard', 'add', 'gravel', 'voice', 'sounds', 'idiot', 'Rafe', 'Spall', 'repulsive', 'Jamie', 'Campbell', 'Bower', 'oddly', 'effeminate', 'acts', 'little', 'boy', 'unbecoming', 'considering', 'man', 'playing', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'out', 'inner', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'not', 'good', 'kind', 'basically', 'overacts', 'EVERYTHING', 'mean', 'cesspool', 'performances', 'cringe', 'more', 'think', 'yes', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'might', 'make', 'top', 'twelve', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'ballot', '2011', 'was', 'good', 'place', 'here', '.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'look', 'rightfully', 'garnered', 'Costume', 'nomination', 'Oscars', 'absurdity', 'film', 'final', 'plot', 'lines', 'performances', 'contained', 'make', 'semi-mockery', 'film.I', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'would', 'drop', 'ball']",Anonymous
1513380,A3W3LP0RSWLJCS,B0068MNNOE,Annihilatrix1138,"[6, 9]","To really get the most out of ANONYMOUS, you'll need to go into the film with a few things handy in memory. First, you'll need a basic knowledge of Shakespeare's plays. Not ALL of them or anything, just some of the mainstays like HAMLET, MACBETH, HENRY V, and maybe RICHARD III. Second, you'll need to know a little bit about theater during the Elizabethan Era, and that Ben Jonson (VOLPONE and THE ALCHEMIST) and Christopher Marlowe (DOCTOR FAUSTUS) would have occupied the same circles as Shakespeare. Third, you'll have to know a little bit about what the film is trying to accomplish. Though it sets things up plainly enough, that perhaps that man we call Shakespeare may have had little to no part in writing the plays we're all aware of in some way, it doesn't really explicitly start pinning authorship on Edward de Vere until a ways into the story. By then so much is flying around, it's easy to miss that subtle build up.It was for me, at least - and I don't claim to have known everything listed above when I first watched the film. It took a bit of research! But that's what I love about ANONYMOUS, that it's drawing upon so much to tell a story so unique to that era. Is it historically accurate? Well, about as much as SCHINDLER'S LIST. That is to say much of what happens here actually happened, but things are definitely skewed for the sake of drama. But it's fantastic drama!There are two storylines at work here, with the primary belonging to Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. He's our tormented artist and the man for which the film is building the case of authorship. He's a member of the English court, the upper crust, and, as such, is supposed to carry himself a certain way. Unfortunately, this does not extend to his writings, which are seen a kind of taboo. Nevertheless, he does continue writing in private, and enlists the aid of Ben Jonson, whom the other half of the film follows. de Vere wishes to see his plays performed, but cannot put his own name on them, so he asks Jonson to have them performed in his name.Unfortunately, mistakes were made, and a drunken actor named William Shakespeare ends up taking full credit for the plays we all know and love.The film continues to follow the growing popularity of de Vere's plays, while giving us insight into his childhood and formal education, from which he drew inspiration for his works. All of this against the background of an unstable political climate being created by Queen Elizabeth's deteriorating health, leaving the next heir to the throne in question. Throw in a few twists and turns that absolutely shocked me and you have some fantastic drama.The story for ANONYMOUS is marvelously written by John Orloff, one of the writers of BAND OF BROTHERS, and directed by Roland Emmerich, who steps up his game tremendously to deliver a film that more than complements the screenplay. Emmerich, an aficionado of ""popcorn flicks"", doesn't drift towards drama too often, preferring large scale disaster/action films, but when he wants drama in front of his camera, he gets it. As such, nearly all of the actors and actresses here turn in A grade performances across the board, with special mention of Rhys Ifans, whose depiction of Edward de Vere manages to channel the torment of an artist born into the wrong station, and the passion of a man who could write HAMLET. I also really enjoyed Rafe Spall's hilarious take on William Shakespeare, not the man who would write HAMLET, but a man who would eventually leave his ""second best bed"" to his wife in his will.All of this to say: I really enjoyed this film. It's clear that everyone in front of and behind the camera were really passionate about the source material. It's detailed enough to be historical but, to a Stratfordian, could even be counted as pleasant alternate history. Thankfully, ANONYMOUS doesn't require you to take its side over the other because, at the end of the day, it's still a celebration of the works we know as ROMEO AND JULIET, TWELFTH NIGHT, and A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (complete with accurate performances of the plays) and concedes that although the authorship of the plays is in question, the impact they've had on the world is undeniable.",5,"""Be all my sins remembered.""",1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,4203,"['really', 'get', 'most', 'ANONYMOUS', ""'ll"", 'need', 'go', 'film', 'few', 'things', 'handy', 'memory', 'First', ""'ll"", 'need', 'basic', 'knowledge', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'Not', 'anything', 'just', 'mainstays', 'HAMLET', 'MACBETH', 'HENRY', 'V', 'maybe', 'RICHARD', 'III', 'Second', ""'ll"", 'need', 'know', 'little', 'bit', 'theater', 'Elizabethan', 'Era', 'Ben', 'Jonson', 'VOLPONE', 'THE', 'ALCHEMIST', 'Christopher', 'Marlowe', 'DOCTOR', 'FAUSTUS', 'would', 'have', 'occupied', 'same', 'circles', 'Shakespeare', 'Third', ""'ll"", 'have', 'know', 'little', 'bit', 'what', 'film', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'things', 'up', 'plainly', 'enough', 'perhaps', 'man', 'call', 'Shakespeare', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'little', 'part', 'writing', 'plays', ""'re"", 'aware', 'way', ""n't"", 'really', 'explicitly', 'start', 'pinning', 'authorship', 'Edward', 'de', 'Vere', 'ways', 'story', 'then', 'so', 'much', 'flying', 'around', 'easy', 'miss', 'subtle', 'build', 'up.It', 'was', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'claim', 'have', 'known', 'everything', 'listed', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'film', 'took', 'bit', 'research', 'what', 'love', 'about', 'ANONYMOUS', 'drawing', 'so', 'much', 'tell', 'story', 'so', 'unique', 'era', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Well', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'SCHINDLER', 'LIST', 'say', 'much', 'what', 'here', 'actually', 'happened', 'things', 'are', 'definitely', 'skewed', 'sake', 'drama', 'fantastic', 'drama', 'are', 'two', 'storylines', 'work', 'here', 'primary', 'belonging', 'Edward', 'de', 'Vere', 'Earl', 'Oxford', 'tormented', 'artist', 'man', 'film', 'building', 'case', 'authorship', 'member', 'English', 'court', 'upper', 'crust', 'such', 'supposed', 'carry', 'certain', 'way', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'extend', 'writings', 'are', 'seen', 'kind', 'taboo', 'Nevertheless', 'continue', 'writing', 'private', 'aid', 'Ben', 'Jonson', 'whom', 'other', 'half', 'film', 'de', 'Vere', 'wishes', 'see', 'plays', 'performed', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'own', 'name', 'so', 'Jonson', 'have', 'performed', 'name.Unfortunately', 'mistakes', 'were', 'made', 'drunken', 'actor', 'named', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'up', 'taking', 'full', 'credit', 'plays', 'know', 'love.The', 'film', 'follow', 'growing', 'popularity', 'de', 'Vere', 'plays', 'giving', 'insight', 'childhood', 'formal', 'education', 'drew', 'inspiration', 'works', 'background', 'unstable', 'political', 'climate', 'being', 'created', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'deteriorating', 'health', 'leaving', 'next', 'heir', 'throne', 'question', 'Throw', 'few', 'twists', 'absolutely', 'shocked', 'have', 'fantastic', 'drama.The', 'story', 'ANONYMOUS', 'marvelously', 'written', 'John', 'Orloff', 'one', 'writers', 'BAND', 'OF', 'BROTHERS', 'directed', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'who', 'up', 'game', 'tremendously', 'deliver', 'film', 'more', 'complements', 'screenplay', 'Emmerich', 'aficionado', 'popcorn', 'flicks', ""n't"", 'drift', 'towards', 'drama', 'too', 'often', 'preferring', 'large', 'scale', 'disaster/action', 'films', 'when', 'drama', 'front', 'camera', 'such', 'nearly', 'actors', 'actresses', 'here', 'turn', 'A', 'grade', 'performances', 'board', 'special', 'mention', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'depiction', 'Edward', 'de', 'Vere', 'channel', 'torment', 'artist', 'born', 'wrong', 'station', 'passion', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'write', 'HAMLET', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Rafe', 'Spall', 'hilarious', 'take', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'not', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'write', 'HAMLET', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'eventually', 'leave', 'second', 'best', 'bed', 'wife', 'will.All', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'clear', 'everyone', 'front', 'camera', 'were', 'really', 'passionate', 'source', 'material', 'detailed', 'enough', 'be', 'historical', 'Stratfordian', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'counted', 'pleasant', 'alternate', 'history', 'Thankfully', 'ANONYMOUS', ""n't"", 'require', 'take', 'side', 'other', 'end', 'day', 'still', 'celebration', 'works', 'know', 'ROMEO', 'AND', 'JULIET', 'TWELFTH', 'NIGHT', 'A', 'MIDSUMMER', 'NIGHT', 'DREAM', 'complete', 'accurate', 'performances', 'plays', 'authorship', 'plays', 'question', 'impact', ""'ve"", 'had', 'world', 'undeniable']",Anonymous
1513381,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B0068MNNOE,Arch Stanton,"[6, 10]","This movie isn't remotely accurate. But that's ok. It clearly isn't trying to be. Where it does fall down is that it isn't even believable. Nor is it thrilling. It's plodding and dull. I went in hoping that it would either be ridiculously bad or decently good, but it falls somewhere in the middle which makes it surprisingly unmemorable. It is however, at least original.What's quietly infuriating about this movie is Roland Emmerich's apparent desire to tear down the English. Shakespeare is a buffoon. That's to be expected from the very premise. But did they have to make Elizabeth an incompetent too? As a young woman she acts like a horny high schooler. She sleeps with everyone and has had several bastards which somehow nobody noticed despite her highly public position. She displays no evidence of nobility and simply acts like one of the girls. She is also under the control of William Cecil, the arch-villian of the piece. As an old woman she fares no better, suffering from dementia or at least deteriorating mentally. And do we really need tales of incest as well? At no point does she display any trace of class. In fact, the only character who does display this is De Vere, and he's the one that everyone keeps berating for not following his (ill-defined) role as a nobleman. The Cecils do display a bit of this, but they're so cartoonishly evil that it never really sticks. Between this, the scene of the British burning villagers to death inThe Patriot, and the unnecessary scene of Queen Elizabeth II walking her dogs onto the escape ship in2012I'm detecting a real pattern here.Emmerich really doesn't get Shakespeare at all. Everything that Shakespeare wrote served one fixed political purpose? It doesn't take a literary critic to see that that makes no sense. His use of the plays for political ends displays only the most superficial examples. For example, Polonius from Hamlet is dressed like William Cecil. Therefore his getting stabbed is a strike against Cecil. My only question is this: How? How does dressing a character up as a political figure count as making a political point? Polonius wasn't one of Shakespeare's arch-villains (Robert Cecil gets a much better one in Richard III), he was just a somewhat crafty man assisting the king. So what was the implication of it? There's nothing damaging to Cecil's reputation there, and the only reason that there is any connection made is because of the costuming. Which isn't anything to do with the written play at all. He could have dressed anyone up as Cecil and it would have had the same effect is what I gather. So that means the choice of ""Shakespeare's"" plays is unnecessary. They could have used anyone. And watching a play wherein the villain looks like a famous figure is reliably going to provoke a riot calling for his overthrow? Really? How dumb does he think people are? If somebody digitally placed Obama's head on Hitler's body could we expect the same reaction here?A really confusing aspect of this film is its tendency to switch between modern and Elizabethan English at the drop of a hat and for no reason. It's like they remember to match the tone of the plays only occasionally and then ad lib the rest. Another confusing feature is how they keep switching back and forth in time. The only way to keep track is to spot the younger actors playing the part. Not always easy to tell in all those elaborate costumes.So the good points: Rhys Ifans is excellent as Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. He's pretty much the only character who manages to be interesting and sympathetic. While they never give him any motivation or insight (being a genius is considered enough of an explanation apparently) he does at least come off well. Also coming off pretty well (or at least entertaining) is Rafe Spall as Shakespeare. He's a pathetic, greedy little man and it is immensely fun. Apart from them and a brief introduction by Derek Jacobi (performing the same role he did better in Henry V) the acting in this film is uniformly horrible. The look of the city is superb and manages to capture a good deal of the griminess that most films manage to leave out while still maintaining a sense of scale. It was very nice to see London Bridge rendered in beautiful CGI. Also, some of the staging (although stolen from better films) wasn't too bad. But apart from these fairly minor points the movie has nothing to offer. You're better off seeingShakespeare in Loveor one of the many films based off his plays. This one offers a fresh idea, but cannot decide whether it is a realistic drama or an over-the-top spectacle. Either one would be fine, but this film never commits.",2,Rather a Wasted Effort,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,4656,"['movie', ""n't"", 'remotely', 'accurate', 'ok', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'Where', 'fall', 'down', ""n't"", 'even', 'believable', 'thrilling', 'plodding', 'dull', 'went', 'hoping', 'would', 'either', 'be', 'ridiculously', 'bad', 'decently', 'good', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'surprisingly', 'unmemorable', 'however', 'least', 'original.What', 'quietly', 'infuriating', 'movie', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'apparent', 'desire', 'tear', 'down', 'English', 'Shakespeare', 'buffoon', 'be', 'expected', 'very', 'premise', 'did', 'have', 'make', 'Elizabeth', 'incompetent', 'too', 'young', 'woman', 'horny', 'high', 'schooler', 'everyone', 'had', 'several', 'bastards', 'somehow', 'nobody', 'noticed', 'highly', 'public', 'position', 'evidence', 'nobility', 'simply', 'acts', 'one', 'girls', 'also', 'control', 'William', 'Cecil', 'arch-villian', 'piece', 'old', 'woman', 'better', 'suffering', 'dementia', 'least', 'deteriorating', 'mentally', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'tales', 'incest', 'well', 'point', 'display', 'trace', 'class', 'fact', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'display', 'De', 'Vere', 'one', 'everyone', 'berating', 'not', 'following', 'ill-defined', 'role', 'nobleman', 'Cecils', 'do', 'display', 'bit', ""'re"", 'so', 'cartoonishly', 'evil', 'never', 'really', 'sticks', 'Between', 'scene', 'British', 'burning', 'villagers', 'death', 'inThe', 'Patriot', 'unnecessary', 'scene', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'II', 'walking', 'dogs', 'escape', 'ship', 'in2012I', ""'m"", 'detecting', 'real', 'pattern', 'here.Emmerich', 'really', ""n't"", 'get', 'Shakespeare', 'Everything', 'Shakespeare', 'wrote', 'served', 'one', 'fixed', 'political', 'purpose', ""n't"", 'take', 'literary', 'critic', 'see', 'sense', 'use', 'plays', 'political', 'ends', 'only', 'most', 'superficial', 'examples', 'example', 'Polonius', 'Hamlet', 'dressed', 'William', 'Cecil', 'Therefore', 'getting', 'stabbed', 'strike', 'Cecil', 'only', 'question', 'How', 'How', 'dressing', 'character', 'up', 'political', 'figure', 'count', 'making', 'political', 'point', 'Polonius', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'Shakespeare', 'arch-villains', 'Robert', 'Cecil', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'Richard', 'III', 'was', 'just', 'somewhat', 'crafty', 'man', 'assisting', 'king', 'what', 'was', 'implication', 'nothing', 'damaging', 'Cecil', 'reputation', 'there', 'only', 'reason', 'connection', 'made', 'costuming', 'Which', ""n't"", 'anything', 'do', 'written', 'play', 'could', 'have', 'dressed', 'anyone', 'up', 'Cecil', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'effect', 'what', 'gather', 'choice', 'Shakespeare', 'unnecessary', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'anyone', 'watching', 'play', 'villain', 'famous', 'figure', 'reliably', 'going', 'provoke', 'riot', 'calling', 'overthrow', 'Really', 'How', 'dumb', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'somebody', 'digitally', 'placed', 'Obama', 'head', 'Hitler', 'body', 'could', 'expect', 'same', 'reaction', 'here', 'A', 'really', 'confusing', 'aspect', 'film', 'tendency', 'switch', 'modern', 'Elizabethan', 'English', 'drop', 'hat', 'reason', 'remember', 'match', 'tone', 'plays', 'only', 'occasionally', 'then', 'ad', 'lib', 'rest', 'confusing', 'feature', 'how', 'keep', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'only', 'way', 'keep', 'track', 'spot', 'younger', 'actors', 'playing', 'part', 'Not', 'always', 'easy', 'tell', 'elaborate', 'costumes.So', 'good', 'points', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'excellent', 'Edward', 'Vere', 'Earl', 'Oxford', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'be', 'interesting', 'sympathetic', 'never', 'give', 'motivation', 'insight', 'being', 'genius', 'considered', 'enough', 'explanation', 'apparently', 'least', 'come', 'off', 'well', 'Also', 'coming', 'off', 'pretty', 'well', 'least', 'entertaining', 'Rafe', 'Spall', 'Shakespeare', 'pathetic', 'greedy', 'little', 'man', 'immensely', 'fun', 'Apart', 'brief', 'introduction', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'performing', 'same', 'role', 'did', 'better', 'Henry', 'V', 'acting', 'film', 'uniformly', 'horrible', 'look', 'city', 'superb', 'capture', 'good', 'deal', 'griminess', 'most', 'films', 'manage', 'leave', 'out', 'still', 'maintaining', 'sense', 'scale', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'see', 'London', 'Bridge', 'rendered', 'beautiful', 'CGI', 'Also', 'staging', 'stolen', 'better', 'films', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'apart', 'fairly', 'minor', 'points', 'movie', 'nothing', 'offer', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'seeingShakespeare', 'Loveor', 'one', 'many', 'films', 'based', 'off', 'plays', 'one', 'fresh', 'idea', 'can', 'not', 'decide', 'realistic', 'drama', 'over-the-top', 'spectacle', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'film', 'never', 'commits']",Anonymous

Hardly a suppression of evidence.If anyone reads none-Oxford books, like Andrew Gurr's ""The Shakespearean Stage, 1574 - 1643 (Elizabethan to Jacobean), There is an appendix of a Selected list of plays and their playhouses, authors, companies, and dates.:""Fair Em"", author Anonymous, c.1590 Strange's Men at the Rose""The Fair Maid of Bristol: Anonymous, c.1604, the King's Men, at the Globe, Shakespeare's group!!!

He only wrotee two plays a year. His troupe may have performed some of his past plays, but they also needed new plays, even from anonymous authors. as this list shows. Some were no doubt better than others.  But de Vere certainly did not need to pay Shakespeare to put his name on plays.  The concept is totally, incomprehensible, does not make sense, and is not relevant with events in Shakespeare's world, as this list shows.I am not a film critic, so I will not judge the acting, directing, set design, sounds effects, costumes, and the rest....actually, I don't think that this film will convince anybody who wasn't already convinced.  If it actually did some intellectual damage on viewers, they did not have much inside anyway.The case for Eddie de Vere has not improved in 100 years. In Bill Bryson's words""""In short, it is possible, with a kind of selective squinting, to endow the alternative claimants with the necessary time, talent, and motive for anonymity to write the plays of William Shakespeare.  But no one has ever produced the tiniest particle of evidence that they actually did so.""""Looney never produced evidence to explain why Oxford, a man of boundless vanity, would seek to hide his identity.""  ....""All Looney would say is 'That, however, is his business, not ours"".Of course, as Ogburn anticipated, Shakespeare will have to be decapitated before Eddie de Vere is made the King. And Ogburn took the torch from Delia Bacon, calling Will an illiterate country bumbkin, with absolutely no evidence that his was true, but facts did not bother Ogburtn.  What he wanted to believe, that was his own truth.No records that Will attended school...therefore he didn't.  That was current for awhile.  Without attending school, it is very unlikely that he would have been able to write the plays.  But ""absence of evidence is not evidence of absence"" and if you know anything about John Shakespeare, you are pretty sure he would have walked his son to his first day of school and made sure he stayed there.So now we have a literate person, who can translate Latin, knows some rhetoric, and who is ready to go to London to write plays....ButWAIT...A new book comes out that does not deny that Will went to school, but that the school was more inferior than is stated in most biographies make out...And so it goes on...he had to have visited Italy...he had to have been a lawyer...he had to have gone to a Univeristy...he had to have been in the military....My God! If Will had done all that, when would he have found time to write the plays and sonnets?This entire bogus discussion will go on for another century, perhaps more claimants will arise....But Shakespeare's name will remain on the plays, mainly because HE WROTE THEM....",1,one thumbs down,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,4640,"['film', 'based', 'false', 'ridiculous', 'premise', 'aristocratic',

1513387,AB34G6VKP28L,B0068MNNOE,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[26, 35]","This film has Elizabethan and Shakespearian scholars alike up in arms, because it suggests that the great, learned man known as William Shakespeare may not have written his own plays. I am a scholar of Elizabeth, and I saw it with a scholar of Shakespeare. Both of us were offended... and both of us were impressed.Poet Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) has been dragged into the Tower of London for concealing the politically motivated plays of the late, lamented William Shakespeare. His belief that they have burn down with the Globe Theater sends the audience into earlier times, and the artistic merits of the Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans). A man of title but no longer a fortune thanks to his debts and his insistence upon writing, he searches for a name to put with his voice. Ben seems the ideal choice, a poet of little regard and no actual voice, a playwright whose works are of little account. But he is offended at the notion of putting his name to another man's plays and passes the manuscript along to William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), an actor who snatches up the opportunity to become famous. His plays swiftly come to the attention of the aging Elizabeth Tudor (Vanessa Redgrave), who recalls a much earlier time when she was similarly impressed by the Earl's works.Their romance (Joely Richardson, Jamie Campbell Bower) plays out against the political scheming of her advisors, among whom is the hunchbacked Robert Cecil (Edward Hogg). Much later, the Earl of Oxford intends to influence the decision of the queen as to which of her heirs will inherit the throne -- and the play Richard III will incite the peasants against her trusted advisor. What results is a clever blending of actual events and fictitious conclusions. Some of them, like the curiosity surrounding how a man of little learned means could have written such magnificent plays, are valid questions. Others, like the fact that Elizabeth had numerous illegitimate children, stretch the imagination a bit. But as far as rearranging history goes, it is exceptionally well done and will make you wonder at the end if any of it is possible. My friend began with the assurance that Shakespeare wrote his own plays and concluded wondering if her initial theory is in fact the truth. In that regard, the film is a masterpiece of manipulation, lent an air of seriousness through the early narration of renowned Shakespearian performer Derek Jacobi. But when it comes right down to it, some of the conclusions it draws are far too unbelievable and do no service to my favorite historical monarch.Many have complained that this film is difficult to follow, since it jumps back and forth between three different timelines -- the semi-modern story surrounding the arrest of the poet concealing the literary masterpieces, earlier in his own life as the Earl found a voice for his plays, and as a young man when he was romantically linked to Elizabeth. It does require the audience pay attention but I had little trouble keeping up with events. In all regards, it is an accomplishment of costuming and actor choices. Everyone is magnificent in their respective roles and the dialogue flows with ease. I am curious, however, as to why so much of the score was slight revision on Elizabeth's score.A decent way to reference this film would be ""intriguing."" It leaps to wild conclusions but carries the audience along for the ride. It has a leading man who is unlikable yet we are too fascinated to abandon him entirely. I'm honestly torn in my opinion of it because on one hand, it makes a startling argument and blends history so well that it left even me questioning the motivations behind certain events. But on the other, I hate revisionist history and that is what it is actively engaged in doing, smearing the reputation of Elizabeth I along the way. But as much as it started steam rising over my head, it also entertained me. So what am I left with?

1513388,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B0068MNNOE,Chip Kaufmann,"[4, 8]","As someone who believes that Shakespeare did write his own plays, I am rather puzzled by the outright hostility that ANONYMOUS is receiving in some quarters. Most (but not all) of the negative reviews are from people who cannot get past the central conceit that someone else may have written them. ANONYMOUS never claims to be historically accurate. In fact it is littered with several blatant historical inaccuracies (Shakespeare murdering Christopher Marlowe 5 years after the fact, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM written by a child of 10, Queen Elizabeth's funeral procession on a frozen river Thames, the Tudor Rose as a flower not an emblem) that make it quite clear that this is intended to be a work of historical fiction. So was SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE but no one got upset over that film at least not to the extent that they have here.What we do have is a major ""what if"" scenario that works quite well as an Elizabethan costume drama with some seriously heavy overtones (""Delicious isn't it? Right out of a Greek tragedy"" says Robert Cecil toward the end). Edward Hogg's portrayal of Robert Cecil is outstanding and David Thewlis as his father William is virtually unrecognizable. Kudos also to Sebastian Armesto as a conflicted Ben Jonson. In fact, I found all of the performances to be solid and above average and they kept me interested in the proceedings. The recreation of Elizabethan London is marvelous and shows that CGI can be used to great effect (like glass painting in old Hollywood movies) without resorting to blowing things up. I truly got the feeling that I was actually watching a performance at the Globe Theater especially when the rain began to fall.I should point out that I saw this film in a movie theater on more than one occasion. The last time was with a bunch of college students in attendance. While they knew that what they were seeing was historically false, they still got caught up in the dramatic storyline and were shaken by the final revelation(s) which is what classic tragedy is supposed to do. We had a lovely discussion afterwards, a 60 year man and a group of college students. It was refreshing and invigorating! As stated earlier, I do believe that Shakespeare wrote his plays but in the end it doesn't really matter. The important thing is that we do have the plays and, to quote Derek Jacobi at the end, they ""shall be remembered as long as words are made of breath and breath of life.""

1513389,ACJVGDN8G386P,B0068MNNOE,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[12, 19]","About 300 years after the publication of the first collected works of Shakespeare, the so-called First Folio (1623), a schoolmaster named J. Thomas Looney (pronounced ""loanee"") facilitated his students in readings of the Shakespeare plays, particularly ""the Merchant of Venice"". Over the years while watching the plays, hearing their rhetoric, and absorbing this remarkable voice whose Elizabethan presence is still revered and studied today, Looney became convinced the man from Stratford who is attributed to having written the plays (the Orthodox View), was not the true author. He came to believe the name ""William Shakespeare"" which appeared on two published poems, the later quartos and the First Folio was in reality a pseudonym for someone else, possibly a nobleman. Previously, those who questioned the Orthodox View, sometimes called Anti-Stratfordians, had proposed others of the Elizebethan Age, such as Sir Francis Bacon and Christopher Marlowe, but Looney was convinced the true author was someone never before put forth since Shakespearian scholarship began in the 18th century. Shakespeare has and still does remain shrouded in mystery.Because Shakespeare biographical detail has been sketchy at best, Looney developed a profile similar to those used by detectives to paint a picture of his candidate, based on elements in the plays. He determined the writer was a nobleman, a Falconer, possibly sympathetic to the Lancastrian side of the Wars of the Roses, and someone who loved Italy and Italian culture. And, most important of all, that he was a poet who possibly had written poems and/or plays under his own name before going under the name of William Shakespeare. After finding a number of primary sources at the British Library, he came up with his findings. Looney proposed a somewhat forgotten nobleman named Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, as being the true identity of the poet/playwright William Shakespeare in a book called simply ""Shakespeare Identified"".""Anonymous"" is a film based on Looney's original notion that Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, penned the plays which would become the greatest literary canon of the English language. The events surrounding the plays, their performances, Oxford's conscious willingness to stay behind the scenes, and the attribution of the plays to the man from Stratford, a businessman who had little or no experience in theatre, are all dramatized in a period film which takes you back to the world of the Elizabethan Stage. One of the best aspects of ""Anonymous"" is how it relates the plays to political rhetoric of the period. In recent years, Shakespearian scholars have proposed that many figures of the Elizabethan Court were satirized in the plays, such as William Cecil and his son Robert Cecil. The links between the plays and contemporary politics are brought to the fore much more directly than in ""Shakespeare in Love"".Character actor Rhys Ifans offers an Oscar-caliber performance as the man who some believe was the real Shakespeare. Ifans finds that delicate balance between the remarkable artist and the troubled nobleman who could not reconcile the two worlds of his life. If Shakespeare was in fact a nobleman who went under a pseudonym, many of the events portrayed in ""Anonymous"" are plausible. Unlike today, playwrights and poets lived on the periphery of society, and a nobleman of the rank of Oxford writing plays containing charged political rhetoric would have been scandalous, hence the Shakespeare-Oxford theory.The hero of the movie is actually his colleague Ben Johnson, the Elizabethan playwright who has always dwelt under the shadow of Shakespeare, especially in modern times. Johnson would have been the greatest playwright of his age if Shakespeare had not been writing. In this story, he becomes the guardian of the Shakespeare plays, and supposedly the man who saves the canon for posterity. Johnson in fact wrote the preface to the First Folio of 1623. If there had been a cover-up of Shakespeare's true identity, Johnson would have known.While the film bases many of its embellishments on facts known about Edward de Vere, the film does take a few rather implausible historical licenses, not unlike Amadeus which appeared about 25 years ago. Edward de Vere may have flirted with Queen Elizabeth when he was younger, but whether they bore a child does seem quite fantastic. Later in the film, an extraordinary truth about Oxford's own heritage is revealed. However, films have to tell a story, and some licenses are made in order the story remain interesting and compelling. Shakespeare in many of his plays bent history to fulfill his dramatic goals and theatrical visions.Many Shakespeare enthusiasts not only dismiss the Oxfordian argument but do not approve of the subject altogether. Some Stratfordians' view is that there is no ""authorship question"" and that any attempt to discredit the man from Stratford does a disservice to Shakespare. I think ""Anonymous"" is not so much about changing minds but about bringing the question out into the open. Regardless on which side of the fence you may be, there are a lot of questions concerning the life of Shakespeare. Answers to mundane questions, such as primary sources concerning his composing, are strangely absent. No one seems to have mentioned Stratford being any kind of a poet, playwright or actor in Stratford. However, as shown in the film, primary source evidence survives which speaks of Edward de Vere as an adolescent putting on a short play for the young Queen Elizabeth.So the film brings us back to the fundamental question: did Oxford write the Shakespeare Canon or was it the man from Stratford? Primary source evidence is sparse, and documents which could have shed light on this problem may have perished in the Great Fire of London in 1666. In short, we may never know. But Oxford's star is on the rise, and in years to come, this may be the first film to acknowledge there is indeed a question. Whether it has been answered is up to each viewer.",5,"Possibly the Greatest Literary Deception of All Time Gets Suberp Cinematic Treatment--Superior to ""Shakespeare In Love"",",1331251200,"03 9,

His performance here is great, showing great maturity compared to some of his earlier films.Rafe Spall is best known to British TV viewers although he did appear in several films including a role as Jonathan Harker in a 2006 version of ""Dracula"" and played Noel in ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004).German born Roland Emmerich produced and directed the film. Emmerich is best known for his work as writer and director of the block buster hit ""Independence Day"" (1996) as well as ""Stargate"" (1994), ""Godzilla"" (1998), ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004). ""Anonymous"" is a clear change of pace for Emmerich, however, it handles it very well.There's lots of material for those who are interested in Shakespeare and his plays, plus a secondary plot about politics (almost mandatory in any British film) as well as fabled stories about the sexcapades of the Virgin Queen.BTW - Redgrave does a great job as the Queen, but my personal favorite remains Bette Davis.The costumes, photography (and new CGI technology) and scenery are breath taking, giving us the feeling that we are really in 17th Century England.The film earned over $1 million in its opening weekend in the US in October 2011, which is a poor showing given the $30 million budget. Through the end of the year the total earnings were about $15 million.Roger Ebert called the film ""ingenious"" and ""a marvelous historical film"" and Rex Reed called it a ""dazzling panorama of Tudor history"". Variety, however, was disappointed and said the drama ""veers close to comedy"" and the reporter from The New Yorker found it too confusing.Bottom line - a clever, entertaining look at Tudor England and the works of Shakespeare.(FWIW - I believe that films like this, which don't cater to the normal popcorn crowd, need to be supported so that we continue to get thought provoking cinema.

1513399,A1LKQ81O0BP49Q,B0068MNNOE,Dr. Miguel Faria,"[4, 6]","I first learned about this controversy after reading an article by essayist and editor Joseph Sobran in National Review (NR) in 1991. Suddenly many murky questions I had about William Shakespeare became very clear. The real author of his plays, Sobran claimed, was Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, a very learned man and a literary scholar but whose authorship of those plays was not acceptable for a man of his rank. Rhys Ifans is magnificent in his role as the Earl of Oxford.The veracity and revisionism of the Sobran article was answered in a subsequent NR issue by none other than Charlton Heston, who vigorously defended Shakespeare and the accepted conventional historical account.The movie is magnificently made, the acting and cast superb, the setting (e.g. the Globe Theater, circa 1600 London, etc.) and cinematography outstanding, but the historical additions and elaborations, interwoven with pompous fictional exuberance, detract from the more serious literary debate. So I for one was disappointed for example when as someone else wrote Queen Elizabeth I was transformed in the film from the austere, dignified Tudor Virgin Queen, who placed the throne and England above everything else, to a young, fluttering nymphomaniac monarch butterfly and later to a befuddled old hag of a queen.In those days of the Renaissance when monarchs had no real private lives, Queen Elizabeth I could not have been another Catherine the Great without the court and courtiers knowing of her sexual liaisons and gossipy peccadilloes, nor could she have prevented these transgressions from seeping into the fabric of historical accounts.Likewise, the character of William Shakespeare, the literary wraith, is needlessly distorted beyond belief for the purpose of contrast and the sensationalization of the film.The elaboration and interweaving of fictitious events leading to the Earl of Oxford as one of the former lovers of the queen and whose sexual consummation led to the bastardy of the Earl of Southampton also adds to our sense of disbelief.I recommend a little homework for those who seek historical accuracy before watching this movie. Look up the main historical characters and learn a bit about them, i.e., Queen Elizabeth; the Earls of Essex and Southampton; William Cecil and Robert Cecil, his son; Ben Jonson; and of course the Earl of Oxford and William Shakespeare.If one watches this movie with a sense for historical accuracy, not to mention if seeking clarification as to the dispute of who actually wrote the Shakespearean plays -- the film is disappointing. Admirers of Queen Betsy will be enraged. Ben Jonson fans will be delighted. Those seeking historical entertainment and those who enjoy alternative history for its sake - will be entertained. Those who watch historical films to learn history and use that ""history"" for conversational purposes will be deceived, and will be unwitting deceivers to others, unless they are careful historical connoisseurs, who can separate very carefully the wheat from the chaff in this fictionalized historical movie!Dr. Miguel A.

1513407,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0068MNNOE,Grady Harp,"[14, 20]","`All art is political, otherwise it would just be decoration.' ANONYMOUS is first and foremost a beautifully crafted film  - script, direction, lighting, costume, music, cinematography, acting - and whether or not the viewer buys into the premise that the plays and sonnets of Shakespeare were the work of Edward de Vere instead of the apparently illiterate actor 'William Shakspar' is unimportant.  Controversy abounds in every field of study - politics, religion, science, poetry, the origin of man, etc - so the veracity of the film's take on history is not the issue.  The film so beautifully brings to life the period of Queen Elizabeth and the flavor of those times and so richly floods the screen with delicious dialogue and comedy and human frailty that it is immensely successful. Roland Emmerich directs with a firm grasp on Elizabethan ambience and John Orloff's screenplay is wholly convincing.The film's beginning - after Derek Jacobi introduces the concept of the possible misconception of the true William Shakespeare's identity to a contemporary audience, underlining the fact that Shakespeare is as alive today as when the following story begins - is a bit difficult to follow as the timeframes change back and forth throughout the film to make the story plausible. The young Queen Elizabeth (Joely Richardson, daughter of Vanessa Redgrave who plays the aged Elizabeth later) is a flirt and has affairs, one with the young Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford (Jamie Campbell Bower), becomes pregnant, and gives birth to a son whom the Earl is banned from ever seeing or knowing.  Years later their son is the Earl of Southhampton (Xavier Samuel). Edward de Vere as the older Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans in a brilliant performance) who rather than tend to wealth prefers to write plays, works that he passes on to Ben Jonson (Samuel Armesto) in whose theater the plays are performed by an `anonymous' playwright.  The plays have become the favorite entertainment of the aged Elizabeth I (now Vanessa Redgrave) and De Vere soon feels the need to protect his privacy and asks Jonson to accept credit for writing the plays, but Jonson in turn passes that authorship to an illiterate actor named William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) who uses the lie to increase his popularity and wealth.Coloring the atmosphere is the palace intrigue of who will be Elizabeth's heir - and the Cecils (David Thewlis father and Edward Hogg son) decide it must be James of Scotland (not a choice Elizabeth would make).  But since only Elizabeth and de Vere know who the blood heir is the intrigue passes into near warfare with the Essex rebellion against the Queen.Many of the known characters of the period are included  - Christopher Marlowe (Trystan Gravelle), the Earl of Essex (Sam Reid) - making the notion of keeping tack of all the derring-do of the court a bit tedious at times.  But there are so very many moments of memorable beauty in this film that the occasional befuddlement of who is who and what is what simply doesn't matter.  Whether the viewer buys into the identity of William Shakespeare as history has described him or to this far more credible story of the man responsible for writing the greatest plays the world has ever known is inconsequential.

The facts I learned about the period, such as that there was so much mud around the Globe theater that boards were walked upon since there were no concrete sidewalks, give this film the feel of one that has been extraordinarily well researched to the finest details. I like that. A lot.Movies that wreak of stupidity drive me nuts. Thus, this mastery of intrigue of a motion picture, done with extremely precise costuming for the period, sets to create that feeling on actually being in the period, and even the accents used, most especially by Vanessa Redgrave, who is so brilliant a character actor, doing period pieces and historical dramas, who can also make the most serious of moments fill up with such human emotion that audiences feel more than one emotion at a time. I mean, I know the scene is serious but somehow Vanessa Redgrave injects it with an aire of lightness of being that is nearly funny. At the very least, amusing. The heaviness of the topic of who authored the plays attributed to Shakespeare is de-centered by Redgrave's talent for taking me along her journey through becoming a character. Bette Davis is the only other actor who could do that for me.

1513413,A3TXY9E0HDWMXK,B0068MNNOE,Howard Schumann,"[13, 20]","Actor George Dillon has said, ""The purpose of drama is to challenge people and to make people see things slightly differently."" The challenge is laid down in stunning fashion by German director Roland Emmerich in his latest work, Anonymous, one of the best films of the year. Focusing on two of the most important events of the Elizabethan age: the Essex Rebellion of 1601 and the succession to the throne of Queen Elizabeth I, the film supports the premise that Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, a prominent aristocrat and court insider, was the real author of the works attributed to William Shakespeare, plays and poems of romance, tragic political intrigue, and comedy that contain such a compelling beauty and searing intensity that, after 400 years, still reach directly into our hearts and remain there forever.Described as a ""political thriller"", Anonymous creates an atmosphere of foreboding and intrigue that, like many films of the genre, begins with a jumble of names, images, and flashbacks that challenge us to sort it all out. We are not certain of anything, but Emmerich invites us, in the words of Diane Ackerman ""to groom our curiosity like a high-spirited thoroughbred, climb aboard, and gallop over the thick, sunstruck hills."" Steering us through the maze of Tudor history, the film makes credible the startling events of the time, providing an authentic recreation of London in the 16th century with its crowded theaters and raucous audience, cluttered streets, and court royalty decked out in fine jewels.Though some may point out historical inaccuracies in the film, Emmerich, citing Shakespeare in Love as an example, says that the film contains an ""emotional truth"" rather than a literal one because ""the drama is the primary concern."" He need not have had concern on that aspect. Through Emmerich's direction, the writing of John Orloff, the cinematography of Anna Foerster, and the superlative performance of an all British cast including Oscar-worthy performances by Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth I and Rhys Ifans as Oxford, Anonymous succeeds both as an authentic drama and a plausible explanation for many of the problems surrounding the authorship question. While the film may lack a certain depth of characterization, it more than makes up for it with style, spectacle, and an involving story.To some, the film may be skating on narrative thin ice, Emmerich, however, told an interviewer that ""if we provoke, let's provoke all the way,"" and provoke he does. According to Anonymous, de Vere, in addition to being Shakespeare, was also the illegitimate son of the Queen and, in 1573, the father of a son with Elizabeth, Henry Wriothesley, the 3rd Earl of Southampton (Xavier Samuel). Emmerich handles the subject of incest with great taste, with neither the ""Virgin Queen"" nor Oxford knowing the truth until close to the end of their lives. After a brief prologue by actor Sir Derek Jacobi, the film begins with the arrest of playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armento) by faceless men in knight's armor in the middle of a theatrical performance.The author of the play is a well-known writer who, though he is soon released, is taken to the Tower and accused of sedition and slandering the State by the mere act of authoring a play, the mark of a totalitarian society reflecting a growing disdain for the arts. The film then flashes back five years, then forty years, as we become acquainted with the young Earl of Oxford (Jamie Campbell Bower), taught by highly educated tutors with access to a vast library in the home of William Cecil (David Thewlis), where he was brought up as a ward of the court after his father's death. We also witness his marriage to a teenage Anne Cecil (Amy Kwolek), daughter of William, a marriage that never produced any lasting satisfaction for either party.As we return to present time, Oxford is forced to hide his identity because of the biting satire of his plays that lampoon some of the more prominent members of the court, and also as a result of a political arrangement that becomes clearer later in the film. His initial choice to front for him is the same Ben Jonson but Jonson refuses, passing the mantle to Will Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), an actor for the Lord Chamberlain's Men who seizes the opportunity. In a superbly comic performance, Spall portrays Will as an illiterate money-grubber who can barely speak coherently but is willing to sell his name to Oxford at a premium cost. The heart of the plot, however, focuses on the attempt to seize power from Cecil's son Robert, an episode that is known to history as The Essex Rebellion of 1601.This insurrection, led by Robert Devereaux, the Second Earl of Essex (Sam Reid) results in his beheading and the imprisonment of Southampton who is sent to the Tower awaiting certain death. Oxford's attempt to persuade Elizabeth to save their son results in a political deal that makes us privy to why Oxford was never able to reveal his authorship of the Shakespeare canon. While some critics may proclaim the movie a moment of singularity that indicates the end of the world as we know it (even before 2012), Anonymous may have the opposite effect, opening the subject to a wider audience who may be able to view Shakespeare and his times from a totally new perspective.In Robert Heinlein's ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" Jubal said we're prisoners of our early indoctrinations, ""for it is hard, very nearly impossible, to shake off one's earliest training."" If my intuition is correct, the prison gates will soon be swinging wide open, and the shaking will begin in earnest.

1513416,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B0068MNNOE,John's Horror Corner,"[4, 7]","I was getting far too comfortable seeing Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill, Pirate Radio, The Replacements) playing shaggy, directionless buffoons.  FINALLY he has received a strong lead giving a command performance as the Earl of Oxford.  In this compelling period piece it is he, and not the otherwise famed name, who actually penned the works of William Shakespeare.  Growing up in a noble household in which poetry and theater are analogous with sin, he finds himself the recipient of voices, rich with prosaic observations of life, which plague him until they are inked to parchment.  The products of which are the works of Shakespeare.This comes to pass as the Earl bribes a mediocre playwright (Ben Johnson, played by Sebation Armesto) to claim his plays as his own.  However, when the time comes to assume credit before his invigorated audience, Johnson hesitates.  Opportunistically, William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), a desperate actor in the play privy to Johnson's secret deal, steps forward and assumes the role.  What ensues is a web of political deception and betrayal, littered with twists which culminate in a tale more tragic than ""Shakespeare"" himself ever penned.  While I'd love to explain how, I'm NO SPOILER.Online reviews of Anonymous vary wildly in ratings from ""amazing"" to ""boring.""  While I advocate that my opinion is unique to any other and we all have our preferences, I have difficulty understanding how anyone but an ill-educated child could possibly find this ""boring"" unless we're confusing ""boring"" with plotty or ""I didn't like it.""  In defense of other aspects of this film, the set design and cinematography (occasionally CGI-enhanced) didn't quite receive the budget it deserved.  At first, this was disappointing.  However, as I watched on, I appreciated how the budget was used and enjoyed shots of poverty-stricken cityscapes and aerial views of gross architecture.  I get it--these sets are expensive.  It is also worth mentioning that I did not enjoy the characters of William Shakespeare and Ben Johnson.  These characters do little more than serve humbly as the spoon delivering the castor oil that is the ""truth"" of the plot.  I won't rule out that they could have been written considerably better, but this movie is more about the Earl of Oxford, political subterfuge, and his secret.  It's not about the over-the-top, illiterate William Shakespeare.  In fact, the least tragic element of this movie was Shakespeare's fraud.My defense of these flaws clearly identifies my stance on the movie.  I liked it a lot--really, I loved it.  Rhys Ifans has never failed to entertain me, but has never entertained me like this.  The Earl is strong yet desperate, vulnerable with respect to his work yet callous to his wife and civic responsibilities, and deeply methodical yet inconsiderate of consequence.  The Earl is the object of political and romantic turns which drive the story forward, and he is well-complemented by the Queen (played young and old by Joely Richardson of Nip/Tuck and Vanessa Redgrave, respectively) and the manipulative Cecils (played by David Thewlis and Edward Hogg).By the way, the ending...very heavy, very touching, very real.

1513423,A356RFKNIG043B,B0068MNNOE,K. Swanson,"[0, 1]","4.7 starsFirst, the film. Is there a more sumptuous and accurate visual depiction of the Elizabethan Age somewhere else in cinema-land? Pray tell, as I've not seen it. The care for detail and feel from the art directors and costumers here is lush and stunning. That alone makes this worth watching for fans of the period.Likewise the language; Orloff turns many a phrase with great aplomb, and his words flow beside the words of The Bard quite well: no mean feat indeed. Rhys Ifans is extraordinary, though the main fault in his performance lies in the script--more humor is needed! WS was one very very funny guy, and that's missing here. But this is played more as Greek tragedy than bawdy Chaucerian comedy, so it's understandable.The direction is excellent, with non-stop mind-boggling detail from both the sights and sounds, never a dull moment for any intelligent mind, and I was amazed that Emmerich could have this much feel for historical drama after seeing some of his bombastic popcorn flicks. But good on him for taking this much time and effort to produce a real piece of eye candy for period film fans. And his brilliant idea to make this a play within a play within a film dovetails perfectly with WS's own frequent dissections of the layers of reality within the artifice of theater.The plotting is fascinating, presenting a wild yet mostly plausible historical scenario despite various inaccuracies (this is historical fiction, after all), which brings us to the whole did he or didn't he aspect. In short, this film is for those who love WS's work above all, and are not blindly obsessed with who wrote it.Let's be honest: whatever the name of the writer or writers of Shakespeare's frighteningly brilliant canon, the real author is The Muse, or God or whatever you call that spirit that lifts artists into the realm of deep truth. That WS was so possessed so often is the real mystery, whoever he or even they might have been.I find it rather funny and not a little ironic to see how painfully anal some &#34;scholars&#34; can be on this issue (you know, those folks who can't write well enough to live from it, so they have to write about those who could. In other words, a large chunk of Academia. Ouch! If that stung you, imagine what Shakespeare would say about your hero worship...). And miss the forest for the trees much? The real author was clearly brilliant enough to enjoy the mystery, and probably even stoked those fires on purpose out of a sheer love of mankind's endless stupidity. Who invented fire? Does it matter? What counts is that it warms our hearth and cooks our food and lights our way.And so with the works of Shakespeare (but best to burn the collected volumes for maximum warmth). One fact most anti-Oxfordians conveniently ignore is that the children of the actor William Shakespeare could not even write their names; they all signed their papers with an X. That's how the finest writer of perhaps all time educated his kids? Sure it is.And how could a man who'd barely traveled and who didn't speak Greek or Latin or Italian know so much about those tongues or histories or lands?But once again, the main thing is the words he/she/it wrote. And those words are and will forever be truly golden, as the scenes here make so clear. His words ring so true in context of all the drama here, and the Babelsberg extras in the Globe scenes seem truly transfixed by them. Imagine seeing the first production of Hamlet!! The mind fairly reels.And that's what I loved most about this film: the filmmakers' sheer love of the work itself shines through (like me, they seem more amazed by the thoughts than obsessed with who wrote them). And a true bonus here is the commentary by Emmerich and Orloff, one of the best, most revealing and detailed commentaries I've ever heard. I was even more impressed upon finding out how they'd made this, and how incredibly skilfully the green screen was used. I watched it on dvd, but I'll be getting the blu-ray to really appreciate the wondrous costumes and sets. I almost never do that, but this is a film worth watching many times just to take in the many many details.The director and writer also make some very convincing points for the Oxford argument, but if you're one of those folks for whom the pedantry of endless authorship arguments is more vital than the sheer beauty and scope of the Bard's wisdom, then I can only say, good luck with that.Those who understand that Shakespeare is just a name attached to some of the finest thoughts ever written down by any human will continue to focus on what matters: the wit and wisdom of the work itself. The rest is merely smoke and mirrors. It's the truth within the words that makes the Shakespearean canon literally beyond belief, and Anonymous does those words justice in many ways.A gorgeous film that will no doubt be regarded as a true period classic in time.",5,"Visual splendor, excellent script, provocative ideas",1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,4892,"['4.7', 'starsFirst', 'film', 'more', 'sumptuous', 'accurate', 'visual',

Power ""nlp trainer""","[18, 26]","I always accepted the idea that Shakespeare wrote his own plays, and considered anything to the contrary to be merely speculation not fact.  So, the premise-what if Shakespeare never wrote a word, I found not to be appealing.Upon reading some good reviews, I decided to see it, and found it to be a high quality production and a wonderful experience. Director Roland Emmerich  previously directed 2012, and Independence Day, and writer John Orloff previously wrote some episodes of Band of Brothers, and as you watch this movie you will realise this term  BoB originated with Shakespeare.Anonymous proposes the Earl of Oxford wrote all the plays, anonymously donated them to Ben Johnson, a well known writer of the time for him to take credit. Then an uncouth illiterate actor, named Shakespeare steps in to claim the credit.  The peer remained anonymous for reasons of social acceptability.Another reason he may have remained anonymous which I totally loved was the parallel structure between what happened in the plays, and the real life events of the courtiers and Queen Elizabeth. Cecil, the courtier villain in this movie is a hunchback (historical fact), and brother in law of the Earl of Oxford. Richard 3 in Shakespeare's play is a hunchback, so the play becomes a social satire.A scene where a man is stabbed through a curtain mirrors a scene in Hamlet. A usurped heir is sent to Ireland, and there is a plot to kill him, similar to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Hamlet.Emmerich's direction gives Anonymous a much grander scope. We have big set pieces, such as a rebel attack on a bridge leading to the tower of London, rowing a boat in the Thames with the London skyline looming behind, an aerial shot of a huge crowd in the snow, and visual scenes of quite unsanitary London of the time, and he evokes the period very well. For example it rains on the actor in the theater, as he recites his lines.  Certain scenes play out in ways we have not scene before, particularly Hamlet's soliloquy where he holds a knife, Richard 3 as caricature, crowd interaction and participation, sweet talking bawdy ladies with Shakespeare's words. I loved this. Visually outstanding, with exquisite and intricate costumes.I liked the lead actors charisma and presence. He was so in character and looked older for the part that I did not recognise him till the credits. Rhys Ifans starred in Notting Hill, and Pirate Radio.  He does a terrific job, perhaps his best work, as does the actor who plays Johnson.  There is a particular scene between the two of them at the end that makes me tear up even as I write.  Derek Jacobi, begins and ends the movie opening and closing the premise.Vanessa Redgrave plays the doddering confused queen, and her daughter Joely Richardson plays her younger self, who has a torrid affair with the Earl of Oxford when she was young, producing an illicit heir. The queen has several torrid affairs which become part of the plot of succession. Shakespeare was played by Rafe Spall, son of Timothy Spall, who you have probably seen in several movies.If the screenwriter was hoping to persuade me,  he certainly made me think. Perhaps he goes too overboard with Shakespeare having a unique form of illiteracy, he can read words and memorise them but he can't write, and yet he is a scheming manipulative lout, a criminal, a drunkard, a successful entrepreneur, and a sociopath.  Asked to speak to a crowd he stumbles inarticulately over his words. If Shakespeare was as inarticulate, and uneducated as portrayed, how could he have convinced anyone of his genius when he lacked the most basic skills of expression.If not Shakespeare, then who?I did some online research.  Apparently, almost two centuries passed before anyone seriously questioned Shakespeare's authorship.  It has been suggested that Sir Francis Bacon wrote these plays, but why would an already famous writer give credit to someone else.  DeVere appears to be the current favorite among conspiracy theorists.  If DeVere was excluded from the court, as he is in the movie then he would not be in a position to satirise the court, or include such pointed commentary in his plays.  DeVere as a child in the movie performs a piece from Midsummer nights dream for the queen. He could hardly have written it as an adult then, could he?Curiously, at times the movie appears to undermine its own premise.It has been suggested that Sir Thomas North,North of Shakespeare: The True Story of the Secret Genius Who Wrote the World's Greatest Body of Literature, wrote the materials on which some of Shakespeare's plays were based.He did translate Plutarch which Shakespeare used as a source in several plays such as Julius Caesar, Troilus and Cressida, Coriolanus, and Anthony and Cleopatra, adapting them for the stage, converting the words from prose to verse. According to this book, Shakespeare purchased North's works, and then adapted them from the page to the stage.  In some cases the corresponding passages in Shakespeare are word for word what was written by North. Somehow North did not get credit.  Rosalinde from As You Like It apparently is Elisa Nord, (north)North's daughter.Hamlet was adapted from a centuries old story called Amleth, and had several iterations, including Dial of Princes by North. Shakespeare made numerous changes to the original story  Amleth, making it way darker according to a book I readSeven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories.In the movie Ben Johnson proclaims sincere affection for DeVere's language skills.In reality, Ben Johnson famously said of Shakespeare: ""he would... buy the reversion of old plays,""but then mark not whose 'twas first: and after-times may judge it to be his...""Epigram no.56.The movie claims no manuscript written by Shakespeare survives. If you don't have evidence that Shakespeare wrote something, does that mean you have evidence someone else wrote it?  You cannot infer alternative authorship from a negation, only from evidence. If you have evidence that these plays were previously written, and performed or were adapted from books, then you can verify that Shakespeare was not the originator, merely wrote a version, and credit the original source.  It seems that with some of these plays, they were circulating already, and then Shakespeare wrote a version, or made his own adaptation, which then became the definitive version.Undoubtedly, this movie will stimulate debate and controversy.  The idea that he didn't write a single word goes too far in my opinion, it would be interesting to know for sure what he did and did not write.  I do think this is one of the best movies I have seen all year.Wherever you stand on this,  I highly recommend you see it, consider it, and form your own opinion.  For me, it's too tabloidy to be taken seriously, the once virgin queen now a nympho, having an illegitimate son with the real Shakespeare, and so on.Even if like me you do not agree with the premise, you might be surprised to discover you still love the movie.I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.",4,The truth about Shakespeare's lies elsewhere,1319846400,"10 29,

1513427,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B0068MNNOE,MadMacs,"[4, 8]","***Spoiler Warning***This film struck very much the same chord as Oliver Stone's 'JFK' - an extremely well-executed, high quality production that, if my read is correct, a consensus majority of academics and historians dismiss.I claim absolutely no insight into Elizabethan Politics and any struggle for the British throne four-hundred years ago, but simply judge this as a standalone production. Additionally, I have a zero stake in the on-going battle between Oxfordians and Shakespearean Traditionalists. So tossing academic molotov cocktails at my review gains you nothing. Jusy sayin'.'Anonymous' is a sumptuously crafted and textually rich film; one of the few movies where I can say I truly enjoyed this period of history without bloodshed. It's not populist opinion, but I tend to prefer modern interpretations of the Middle-Ages that involve a bit of bladework, shields, flails, and a truncheon mace or two. Not necessarily all-out warfare, but the 16th and 17th Centuries without plagues, fecal-filled streets and the occasional strutting wench tends to wear on my patience, 'The Tudors' notwithstanding.A superbly staged drama with fascinating suggestions of a lost history, illuminating several arguments and posits about the authorship of the works attributed to William Shakespeare. Again, this review simply addresses the film itself and not its place in history. There's real enchantment involved as Director Roland Emmerich deftly and completely pulls us into a time of political turmoil and royal intrigue - and punishment by death for any who dare expose or challenge its secrets.One of the court, Sir Edward De Vere, The Earl of Oxford, has for the entirety of his life disavowed his heritage - dodging court politics and avoiding fiscal endeavors. Why? Forced to suffocate his true calling - to write - he draws out his days with no effort to maintain his estates or manage his affairs. The passion he's forced to sublimate kills his sense of life, becoming listless, bored and withdrawn. But despite a lifelong effort to resist the urge of pen and quill, his passion overcomes his better sense; secretly reaching out to established playwright Ben Jonson, he makes a deal. Paid to be a cut-out, Jonson will front for the noble, allowing his words to be publicly fielded and enjoyed while the earl maintains his anonymity and proper societal standing.And that's how things would've stayed, except, a confluence in history is about to take place.As the rule of childless Elizabeth The First reaches its twilight, the battle for the throne of England dawns. And it's Sir Edward who stands at the nexus.With no legal heir, various factions begin to plot their choice for the throne. None more ambitious than Robert Cecil, prime counselor and advisor to the crown. A machiavellian plan put into action by the infamous humpbacked bureaucrat, intent on insuring his continued existence at court by installing a distaff cousin to Elizabeth as the heir apparent, circumventing her majesty's expressed wishes for his own benefit. Her isolation Cecil's greatest tool, as the hump whispers lies and half-truths in order to maintain control of the royal succession.His plan requires the removal of the one of the leading candidates, Sir Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl Of Essex. And guiltly by association, Sir Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton - unknown to all but three people - as the illegitimate child born of the union between Edward and Elizabeth.After the failure of a direct action assassination attempt, Cecil plots to have Robert and Henry accused of treason against crown and state.Cornered with no visible way out, the pair seek out Sir Edward for advice. Having insinuated himself to young Henry as a family friend and court ally, it's his sage wisdom that has guided his son over the years. And to save both from the executioner's block - he intends on exposing the treacherous plan to remove them from the line of succession.In a final bid to reach the queen's heart, Edward employs his only skill - the written word. Quickly producing ""The Tragedy Of King Richard The Third"" - a thinly disguised jab, scathing admonition and outright mockery of his hunched nemesis. Edward's plan is to inflame the populace, delivering vox populi, vox dei - as the people are already aware of the seedy dark manipulations to install James VI Of Scotland as their new king; a northern royal that many English feel is a foreign-born usurper only remotely related to the bloodline.However, his plans go awry with the unintentional interference by the angry and jealous proxy. Unaware of the larger game being played and hurt by Shakespeare's undeserved fame and accolades, Jonson inadvertently alerts the power brokers of De Vere's intentions. Outmaneuvered and outplayed by Cecil - the execution of the Earl Of Essex as a traitor means his efforts, both private and public, are dealt an unsurvivable blow. He's lost all. His attempt at saving the British crown for an Englishman, giving Henry a place at court, and preserving his legacy are utterly destroyed.All that remains are his words.Oh yes, almost forgot about William Shakespeare. In this proposed alternate history, an insipid and illiterate stage actor who bumbles into the secret of Sir Edward's playwright proxy. With moronic bravery born out of ignorance and avarice - grabs ahold of the notoriety, revels in the infamy and happily blackmails Sir Edward for hush money to maintain the popular pretense. That's it. A hack whom history should've placed as a footnote, instead stands at the illustrious center spotlight, heralded as the greatest English writer in history.And in the context of this production: Dramatic irony that Sir Edward would likely find quite amusing.",4,Gritty Plushdom,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,5739,"['***Spoiler', 'Warning***This', 'film', 'struck', 'very', 'much', 'same',

1513430,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0068MNNOE,Mark Turner,"[5, 8]","It's amazing the stories that come up and even more so to think that they are all completely original. Some say there are truly only several different stories available to tell but that these 3-4 are embellished enough to make them different. Then there are the classics, the tales told for what seems like forever. Take for instance Shakespeare. His plays and sonnets are considered the best ever written in the English language. But what if he wasn't the actual author?There are historical discussions on just this topic and that's where the inspiration for the movie ANONYMOUS comes from. It takes the idea that Shakespeare was actually illiterate and that someone else wrote everything he is credited with.Edward De Vere, the Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans) is an aristocrat dedicated to his queen, Elizabeth I (Vanessa Redgrave). But he sees those around her manipulating things to the way they wish them to be as opposed to what is best for England. It seems that the Queen takes the word and influence of William Cecil (David Thewliss) more than that of anyone and past history has yielded De Vere and Cecil as mortal enemies even though De Vere is married to Cecil's daughter.De Vere is a man of words as well as action. It is through these words that he has always reached the Queen. The movie moves forward and back in time showing them as subject and royalty and also as lovers. But there are dark secrets looming which aren't revealed until much later. The movie is filled with secrets and plotting turning what would at first seem the tale of Shakespeare into a political thriller instead.Watching the lowly crowds during performances of plays De Vere realizes the power one could have by controlling this crowd. They react to the words being performed but none is enough to spark them or inspire them. He has those words and the ability to write them but his position prevents him from doing so. Instead he hires playwright Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armento) to produce the plays he writes using his name instead. Johnson backs out on the deal though, releasing the play as written by Anonymous. When the crowd calls for the author actor William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), who knows of the deal, steps forward to take credit where it isn't due.The plays continue to be written and performed and the crowd can't get enough. And in various stories they can see that they relate to things happening in England, slightly camouflaged but not quite enough to hide their true meaning. At the same time the members of the Queen's court are made aware as well and manipulations are implemented to sway her majesty. The center of their disagreement lies in an heir to the throne. Elizabeth has no legitimate children to inherit the crown and Cecil wants to insert James, the son of Mary and a Scot. Those who believe that only a true Englishman should rule are seeking someone else.The behind the scenes wheeling and dealing, the deceptions that come into play and the final twist in this story make for an interesting film. With so many characters with so many titles, it becomes slightly confusing at times but not enough to take away from the story going on. Instead it's like watching one of the classic BBC series that used the same subject matter just turning it into a 2 hour film rather than a month long series.The acting is amazing. As always to me the sign of a fantastic actor is one who so immerses himself in the role that you never even consider that someone is acting but accept them as that person. Ifans does an amazing job setting so into the role that you would barely recognize him from previous films. The supporting cast does an extremely great job as well and casting Joely Richardson to play the young Queen while her mother portrays the aging Queen was a smart move.The film may not be for everyone. It offers little to no action or true comedy. Instead it tells a possibility that may have existed in history, the true author of the plays of Shakespeare and their real reason for being written. It offers intrigue to the fullest extent making current spy movies seem rather cumbersome and this one more filled with finesse. It's an interesting movie that will entertain you if you give it a chance and perhaps influence you to look deeper. The question of who actually wrote the plays is still in doubt and argued by scholars around the world. Watching a movie like this could inspire you to look deeper into finding an answer.",4,WHAT IF...,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4450,"['amazing', 'stories', 'come', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'think', 'are', 'completely', 'original', 'say', 'are', 'truly', 'only', 'several', 'different', 'stories', 'available', 'tell', '3-4', 'are', 'embellished', 'enough', 'make', 'different', 'Then', 'are', 'classics', 'tales', 'told', 'what', 'forever', 'Take', 'instance', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'sonnets', 'are', 'considered', 'best', 'ever', 'written', 'English', 'language', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'actual', 'author', 'are', 'historical', 'discussions', 'just', 'topic', 'where', 'inspiration', 'movie', 'ANONYMOUS', 'idea', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'actually', 'illiterate', 'someone', 'else', 'wrote', 'everything', 'credited', 'with.Edward', 'De', 'Vere', 'Earl', 'Oxford', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'aristocrat', 'dedicated', 'queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'manipulating', 'things', 'way', 'wish', 'be', 'opposed', 'what', 'best', 'England', 'Queen', 'word', 'influence', 'William', 'Cecil', 'David', 'Thewliss', 'more', 'anyone', 'past', 'history', 'yielded', 'De', 'Vere', 'Cecil', 'mortal', 'enemies', 'even', 'De', 'Vere', 'married', 'Cecil', 'daughter.De', 'Vere', 'man', 'words', 'as', 'well', 'action', 'words', 'always', 'reached', 'Queen', 'movie', 'forward', 'back', 'time', 'showing', 'subject', 'royalty', 'also', 'lovers', 'are', 'dark', 'secrets', 'looming', 'are', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'much', 'later', 'movie', 'filled', 'secrets', 'plotting', 'turning', 'what', 'would', 'first', 'seem', 'tale', 'Shakespeare', 'political', 'thriller', 'instead.Watching', 'lowly', 'crowds', 'performances', 'plays', 'De', 'Vere', 'power', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'controlling', 'crowd', 'react', 'words', 'being', 'performed', 'none', 'enough', 'spark', 'inspire', 'words', 'ability', 'write', 'position', 'prevents', 'doing', 'so', 'Instead', 'playwright', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Sebastian', 'Armento', 'produce', 'plays', 'using', 'name', 'instead', 'Johnson', 'out', 'deal', 'releasing', 'play', 'written', 'Anonymous', 'When', 'crowd', 'author', 'actor', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'Rafe', 'Spall', 'who', 'deal', 'steps', 'forward', 'take', 'credit', 'where', ""n't"", 'due.The', 'plays', 'continue', 'be', 'written', 'performed', 'crowd', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'various', 'stories', 'can', 'see', 'relate', 'things', 'happening', 'England', 'slightly', 'camouflaged', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'hide', 'true', 'meaning', 'same', 'time', 'members', 'Queen', 'court', 'are', 'made', 'aware', 'well', 'manipulations', 'are', 'implemented', 'sway', 'majesty', 'center', 'disagreement', 'heir', 'throne', 'Elizabeth', 'legitimate', 'children', 'inherit', 'crown', 'Cecil', 'insert', 'James', 'son', 'Mary', 'Scot', 'who', 'believe', 'only', 'true', 'Englishman', 'should', 'rule', 'are', 'seeking', 'someone', 'else.The', 'scenes', 'wheeling', 'dealing', 'deceptions', 'come', 'play', 'final', 'twist', 'story', 'make', 'interesting', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'so', 'many', 'titles', 'slightly', 'confusing', 'times', 'not', 'enough', 'take', 'away', 'story', 'going', 'Instead', 'watching', 'one', 'classic', 'BBC', 'series', 'used', 'same', 'subject', 'matter', 'just', 'turning', '2', 'hour', 'film', 'rather', 'month', 'long', 'series.The', 'acting', 'amazing', 'always', 'sign', 'fantastic', 'actor', 'one', 'who', 'so', 'role', 'never', 'even', 'consider', 'someone', 'acting', 'accept', 'person', 'amazing', 'job', 'setting', 'so', 'role', 'would', 'barely', 'recognize', 'previous', 'films', 'supporting', 'cast', 'extremely', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'casting', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'play', 'young', 'Queen', 'mother', 'aging', 'Queen', 'was', 'smart', 'move.The', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'little', 'action', 'true', 'comedy', 'Instead', 'possibility', 'may', 'have', 'existed', 'history', 'true', 'author', 'plays', 'Shakespeare', 'real', 'reason', 'being', 'written', 'intrigue', 'fullest', 'extent', 'making', 'current', 'spy', 'movies', 'seem', 'rather', 'cumbersome', 'one', 'more', 'filled', 'finesse', 'interesting', 'movie', 'will', 'entertain', 'give', 'chance', 'perhaps', 'influence', 'look', 'deeper', 'question', 'who', 'actually', 'wrote', 'plays', 'still', 'doubt', 'argued', 'scholars', 'world', 'Watching', 'movie', 'could', 'inspire', 'look', 'deeper', 'finding', 'answer']",Anonymous
1513431,A3KO4IGP2ALW63,B0068MNNOE,Mea,"[1, 6]","I picked up ""Anonymous"" as an afterthought, having failed to find any other recent releases that looked appealing. The dvd cover called it a ""cloak-and-dagger"" mystery about the possible identity of William shakespeare, set in ""the political snakepit of Elizabethian England"". I'm not overly interested in Elizabethian England, but I'm willing to give most movies a shot if the jacket has more than one good review on it. Ebert called it ""splendid""; another critic said it "" bursts with energy, wit, and drama"". Were it not for these accolades, I would have overlooked what is probably one of the most interesting movies released last year.My basic review: A great story, well-written, with top-notch actors, (Vanessa Redgrave is Queen), lush sets and beautiful period costumes.Warning: if you're looking for entertainment, this is not an easy film. The first time around I drifted off. By the end of the movie I had only a vague idea of what was going on. I had to watch it twice, and really concentrate the second time, to even begin to understand the complex and deeply layered plot.One of my biggest problems with Royal Court dramas is the use of titles in addition to names; Robert the So-and-So is also the Earl of Such-and Such. There are at least a half a dozen titled major characters to keep track of.Add to that a complicated, non-chronological timeline that spans more than 40 years. Amidst the action, (and there's plenty), flash-backs and forwards occur frequently and without warning; the viewer has to really focus to keep up. I had a lot of difficulty keeping track of who was who; Is the young Queen the same Queen as the older Queen shown at the beginning of the film, or another Queen altogether? The elderly Earl looks nothing like the younger Earl, but he does look exactly like his son the Earl. (At least I think they're father and son. I'm pretty sure they were the same actor. You'll see what I mean if you watch the movie.)I have the dvd for 24 hours, so I'm going to watch it again. I don't mind, I enjoy a really demanding film.If you prefer easier entertainment, and are drawn to Shakespeare and the Royal Court, I'd recommend ""Stage Beauty"", one of my all-time favorite movies. I'm hoping to put ""Anonymous"" on that list, but I'll have to study it a bit more first.Great watch for the serious film or Shakespeare buff.Final note: I did watch this a third time, and still find the timeline confusing. I'd hoped the pleasure of watching it would improve with successive viewings, but it stayed about the same. I have to give it 3 stars instead of my original 4. I think this film was a great idea that would have made a much better film had its makers subscribed to the less-is-more school of filmmaking. It might even benefit from some rigorous editing. I still think it's a fascinating story and well worth watching, especially compared to the tons of mediocre, formulaic films you have to dig through to find one as good as this.",3,wonderful but very demanding film,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,2961,"['picked', 'up', 'Anonymous', 'afterthought', 'having', 'failed', 'find', 'other', 'recent', 'releases', 'looked', 'appealing', 'dvd', 'cover', 'called', 'cloak-and-dagger', 'mystery', 'possible', 'identity', 'William', 'shakespeare', 'set', 'political', 'snakepit', 'Elizabethian', 'England', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'interested', 'Elizabethian', 'England', ""'m"", 'willing', 'give', 'most', 'movies', 'shot', 'jacket', 'more', 'one', 'good', 'review', 'Ebert', 'called', 'splendid', 'critic', 'said', 'energy', 'wit', 'drama', 'Were', 'not', 'accolades', 'would', 'have', 'overlooked', 'what', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'movies', 'released', 'last', 'year.My', 'basic', 'review', 'great', 'story', 'well-written', 'top-notch', 'actors', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Queen', 'lush', 'sets', 'beautiful', 'period', 'costumes.Warning', ""'re"", 'looking', 'entertainment', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'drifted', 'off', 'end', 'movie', 'had', 'only', 'vague', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'had', 'watch', 'twice', 'really', 'concentrate', 'second', 'time', 'even', 'begin', 'understand', 'complex', 'deeply', 'layered', 'plot.One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'Royal', 'Court', 'dramas', 'use', 'titles', 'addition', 'names', 'Robert', 'So-and-So', 'also', 'Earl', 'Such-and', 'Such', 'are', 'least', 'half', 'dozen', 'titled', 'major', 'characters', 'keep', 'track', 'of.Add', 'complicated', 'non-chronological', 'timeline', 'more', '40', 'years', 'action', 'plenty', 'flash-backs', 'forwards', 'occur', 'frequently', 'warning', 'viewer', 'really', 'focus', 'keep', 'up', 'had', 'lot', 'difficulty', 'keeping', 'track', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'young', 'Queen', 'same', 'Queen', 'older', 'Queen', 'shown', 'beginning', 'film', 'Queen', 'altogether', 'elderly', 'Earl', 'nothing', 'younger', 'Earl', 'look', 'exactly', 'son', 'Earl', 'least', 'think', ""'re"", 'father', 'son', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'were', 'same', 'actor', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', 'dvd', '24', 'hours', ""'m"", 'going', 'watch', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'enjoy', 'really', 'demanding', 'film.If', 'prefer', 'easier', 'entertainment', 'are', 'drawn', 'Shakespeare', 'Royal', 'Court', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Stage', 'Beauty', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'put', 'Anonymous', 'list', ""'ll"", 'have', 'study', 'bit', 'more', 'first.Great', 'watch', 'serious', 'film', 'Shakespeare', 'buff.Final', 'note', 'did', 'watch', 'third', 'time', 'still', 'find', 'timeline', 'confusing', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'would', 'improve', 'successive', 'viewings', 'stayed', 'same', 'have', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'instead', 'original', '4', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'makers', 'subscribed', 'less-is-more', 'school', 'filmmaking', 'might', 'even', 'benefit', 'rigorous', 'editing', 'still', 'think', 'fascinating', 'story', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'compared', 'tons', 'mediocre', 'formulaic', 'films', 'have', 'dig', 'find', 'one', 'as', 'good']",Anonymous

The good news is that as badly received as this film was we can all breathe easy that there will be no other bizarre conspiracy films like it made again anytime soon.

Much of the drama centers on court intrigues involving Elizabeth, brilliantly portrayed in her later years by Vanessa Redgrave and, as a younger woman, by Redgrave's daughter, Joely Richardson.I am not going to divulge specific plot details, because that would make me a spoiler and this saga has too many deliciously intriguing twists-and-turns that a viewer should discover for himself.The entire cast, which includes David Thewlis (as the nefarious Robert Cecil), Jamie Campbell Bower (as the younger Edward De Vere) and Derek Jacobi, who bookends the story as sort of a narrator, are magnificent.ANONYMOUS, which has received an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design, uses CGI to craft an astounding recreation of Elizabethan England.Extras on the DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment include audio commentary with Emmerich and Orloff, deleted scenes and a featurette, ""Who Is the Real William Shakespeare?"".

C."") goes full costume in this theoretical mystery surrounding the works of William Shakespeare.  For centuries, Shakespeare's numerous plays, poems and sonnets have been probed for authenticity as little, if any, of original Shakespeare's handwritten documents survived.  Writer John Orloff makes a case for the Earl of Oxford being the ghost writer in collusion with Will (Rafe Spall) and Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto).The numerous subplots are often hard to follow what with all the earls, dukes, kings and queens all involved in subterfuge to name the heir to Queen Elizabeth I (Vanessa Redgrave).  Oxford (nicely played by Rhys Ifans) has a burning desire to write and write he does.  Because of his nobility however, publishing would be unheard of.  Writing was perceived by the religious right as blasphemous although that was not the Queen's belief.  In any case writing would be beneath the stature of the Earl.Integrated into the story are numerous bastard children including those born of the Queen herself.

In fact it tries perhaps just a little too hard. Yes the story is presented reasonbly well, all the actors do a fine job butthere are problems. The movie makes many inferences that it would be nice to be able to see a little more proof to back them up. Warning Spoilers ahead! First that the queen had a number of children out of wedlock. That Two of the earls were among them, that she had a relationship with at least two of them unknowingly commiting incest with them. That Shakespeare was actually some sort of special illiterate who took advantage of the earls need of silence and to remain anonymous since if the queen and the court knew that he was the author could have sent him to the tower or at least could have cost him his position at court. There are a number of other inferences in the film, but I will not discuss them here. Though it is interesting that there are no available examples of Shakespeare's or the Earl's works. I found it interesting that the film makers mixed a fair amount of the historical truth in the story. Such as the burning of the Globe Theater, The events surrounding Exxex,the death of the queen, and death of Christopher Marlow. No I don't believe that Shakespear killed him, but he did die mysteriously. The film is a good effort to tell an interesting story. Do I believe any of it to be completely true? No. Is it possible?

1513443,A237RLQXTL55RG,B0068MNNOE,off the tropic,"[3, 7]","Roland Emmerich's film ""Anonymous"" is  worth a look. It resurrects one side of the Shakespeare authorship question by introducing the mass audience to the theory that Edward De Vere, the Earl of Oxford, was Shakespeare's ghost writer. If you are an ""Oxfordian"" this may be the movie for you, not for what it substantiates but for what it dramatizes.I have not paid any attention to the Shakespeare authorship controversy and I continue to remain indifferent to the conclusions of either camp. The fact of the inimitable plays is proof enough for me that there was a committed hand and a matchless imagination behind them. Whether it was Devere, Bacon, Marlowe, or Shakespeare himself is less important for a viewer who judges the merit of a film by the story it tells.  I enjoyed the film, because it takes a position on the authorship question, extracts the dramatic core of the theory and does a great job of movingly telling a story of an unparalleled life committed to art. The film evokes the fun, the labor, the inspiration, and the obsession behind the astonishing feat that is the Shakespeare (or according to this film, the Devere) corpus.The fast paced dramatic narrative is not only entertaining but also imbued with pathos of the story of an artistic life consumed by genius. There are the usual maladies that a big budget Hollywood film suffers from. The director, Roland Emmerich, one of the leading lights of Hollywood, has built his reputation with big budget disaster/science fiction productions (his resume includes ""Independence Day"", ""The Day after tomorrow"", and ""2012""). Even if we continue to get plenty of spectacle and sensationalism here the pathos of the story of the obscure, anonymous, artist shines through. What Emmerich leaves us in this version of the genesis of Shakespeare's plays is the universal tale of the tragedy of the artist.Emmerich's films have their place in world cinema and I am glad that a person of his talent has made a film on Shakespeare's plays. The story that unfolds about Devere as author is an intriguing possibility. Plausibility is what is aimed at here given the fact that the life of the author of these plays will always be shrouded in mystery. Even if this fictional recount of the genesis of the greatest plays in the English language is not history, the major premise of this story is plausible. The film meets that delicate balance of truth and fiction. Any perceived factual weaknesses in the script is adequately balanced by the authentic telling of the story of an artist passionately committed to his art. Stories like this are valuable reminders that legacy of an artist can transcend history and its petty squabbles, and poetic truth is ever at odds with historic truth.The film brings us top notch performances from Sebastian Armesto as Ben Johnson, Vanessa Redgrave as the aged Queen Elizabeth, Joely Richardson as the young Queen Elizabeth, David Thewlis as William Cecil, and Edward Hogg as Robert Cecil. The guy who plays DeVere (Rhys Ifans) is quite brilliant and Rafe Spall as ""Will"" Shakespeare is amusingly appropriate for the role of a dumbed down fraud who happily took the credit for Devere's labors. To take the film on its own terms is important in order to appreciate Ifans's portrayal of DeVere as a person who lives for his art and nothing else. The idea that anyone can live solely for art even if it comes at the cost (or from the artistic/political point of view - benefit) of near universal anonymity drives the pathos of this ""biography"". The obscurity that is the lot of the genuine artist is hardly a deterrent for the passion of  genius. Genius, this story repeatedly reminds us, disdains acclaim, honor, and embraces fate even if that turns out to be tragic. The pathos of cheerfully embracing the dismal lot of genius is the transcendent theme of this story.Director Roland Emmerich's greatest merit is to evoke the passion of the artist to life for us. ""Anonymous"" reminds me of Peter Shaffer's ""Amadeus"" for its soaring tribute to the spirit of the artist who composes his works, not for popular aclaim, but for a much more deeper source of validation. Devere writes because he must. Only an inner compulsion to delight the audience explains the creative act that is the Devere/Shakespeare corpus. Devere desperately wants to entertain the popular audience with his plays but we movingly see how the deeper notes of his plays stuns not only the festive crowd into a thoughtful silence but the greatest poets of the age - from Marlowe to Jonson - who look at the performances of his plays with envy and awe.Devere we learn in the end is seeking validation from one solitary voice. In this case, Devere's audience of one will be Ben Jonson, who we have repeatedly seen being stunned by the artistry of Devere's plays. He is floored at the end of each performance like his distinguished peer, Marlowe. The scene with Devere at his death bed with everything lost - his office, reputation, honor, his son - outwitted by the Machiavellian Robert Cecil shows at once the peculiar liberty of the anonymous artist and the agony of his isolation. But the divinely unconcerned look in the dying Devere despite losing everything confirms his rising hope in the legacy of his words. His real worry is to secure the posthumous life of his words. He does not seem to be bothered about restoring the rightful authorship of these plays under his name. Honor is a distant concern; the survival of his art is only obsession. As an artist he is happy to stay invisible; he is at peace despite betrayal and dispossession. The only endorsement Devere seeks is Ben Jonson's verdict of his plays.Jonson's ecstatic note of acknowledgement that the poetry, the words, are the most wondrous he has heard, and his confidence that those plays will continue to amaze future readers, is a scene of great dramatic power. This is the high point of the film. Devere's story may end up in obscurity but the plays will transcend his age; his writings will soar past the political intrigues and conspiracies of the age and live for all ages. Ultimately the wider audience will keep the meaning of these plays alive and well. The author is unimportant but his literary legacy will never be condemned to anonymity.Mainstream films that attempt to resurrect the life of genius this way ought to be encouraged. Films that entertain can also happily bring with it moments of surprise. If only films like this could be brought to screen more often and be a more regular part of Hollywood's friday night fare, we would perhaps have more readers taking up Shakespeare. The story brought to life here is not unlike a Shakespearean play - with themes that resonate with a popular audience. The film, like the plays, offers subterfuge, deceit, war, obsession, love, friendship, loyalty, and betrayal, the ingredients for great drama; but there are also moments of moral redemption and loftiness, with the narrative offering an eloquent argument for the high value of the uncompromising artistic life utterly devoted to art.Roland Emmerich's ""Anonymous"" is a film of undeniable emotional power. This retelling of the ""Oxfordian theory"" should be seen with reasonable expectations, and by this I mean, the claims of the story offered here ought not to be seen as a serious excursion into history. ""Anonymous"" shines as a story passionately told about a writer in love with writing, who seemingly disdained authorship by risking complete anonymity, to create the greatest poetry of the Elizabethan age.",4,Blissfully Anonymous,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,7552,"['Roland', 'Emmerich', 'film', 'Anonymous', 'look', 'one', 'side', 'Shakespeare', 'authorship', 'question', 'introducing',

This has produced many entertaining and well-reasoned reviews and posts, seemingly because the movie itself is a diatribe, and arguments beget arguments.Still, when you look at a movie, you have to ask whether it succeeds at more than merely being provocative.  In this case, I would say no, not really.  'Anonymous' is off-putting.  Just out of the gates, in the beginning segment, the beguiling Mr. DeVere announces that ""all art is political...""  Well, that is a very postmodern statement from an Elizabethan personage, parroting the common modern 'wisdom' that history is but an agreed-upon set of lies.It also seems a bit disingenuous to present a 'hot' controversy that in fact has been debated for centuries.  And this movie nearly succeeds in creating a reductio ad absurdum.  Marlowe, Jonson and other playwrights of the period are depicted as semi-competent and glib, sort of like a fraternity of precocious underclassmen.  And then the dubious 'true author' is presented as a shadowy, Phantom-of-the-Opera figure--an isolated, bitter genius, who is quite professorial in his outlook, and sports a desk and study bedecked with cliches.This also feeds into a current love of conspiracy theories in the movie-going public, which has been treated to ""Amadeus"", and ""The DaVinci Code"".  Are these speculations really brave, or are they manipulative?  They certainly are moneymaking.In the end, the argument seems to hinge on whether a lowly actor could indeed possess the imagination and knowledge to have produced these masterpieces.  Actors are cattle, right?  But doesn't an actor succeed on innate understanding of human nature?  That is a question this movie doesn't answer, because Shakespeare had perhaps the best understanding of human nature ever known to mankind.  One would think he would also have been a terrifically social individual, and not really a reclusive man who hid in darkness.It reminds me of one of my favorite song lyrics.  ""All in all, it's all the same--but, call me if there's any change"" , from a baroque-rock upstart named Keith Reid.  It doesn't matter.  It will never be resolved.

1513447,A1CA1A1MGW0I3J,B0068MNNOE,Raisuli the Magnificent,"[4, 10]","The question of the authorship regarding the ""first folio"" is a very valid one.  So when a SFX bonanza director takes camera, crew and cast in hand to create one of the most appalling addresses of the issue, one cannot but wonder what possessed him to even consider making the script in the first place.The whole thing smacks of a paranoid fantasy gone awry.  As if someone took a syringe of ""paranoid serum"" and injected it into the celluloid or hard drive upon which the images were gathered.  It's as if the screenwriter and everyone else on the bandwagon of questioning the authorship decided to get in on the joke and make a farce of a film that plays up to every conspiracy hack's nightmare come true.The technical merits of the film are fine, but the trouncing of beliefs by the critical thinkers who wonder if William Shakespeare actually penned the plays and poems he did, is taken to new heights of ""I am an actor, believe in the emotional correctness of my position... therefore I am, and anybody who challenges that, is dead wrong, and unworthy of consideration"".I mean, wow.  The idea of wanting a confident persona to play a part for a stage play or film is all well and fine, but when those people substitute critical analysis for emotional hubris, one can't help but be glad that they are not mathematicians, detectives, judges, lawyers, chemists, physicists, engineers of all stripes, and any other career that requires left brain conviction in facts and the mechanisms that churn those facts to present truth.  One truly is glad of that.But a person wonders, have any of them really considered the arguments, or are they just there trying to garnish yet another set of praises and appeal for the sake of a stroke of ego and dollar signs?  Probably the later.  The research is too long and boring, and challenges the emotional investment they have and that of their friends.  It's a very incestuous relationship being in a theatre troupe, because no one wants to be confronted with the cold hard logic of ""you're wrong"".Because the minute you do that, you tear away at their being.  So it is with this film.  A piece of cinematic trash created to draw out the lunatics of society who believe that Edward De Vere by himself penned all the great literary works of our time.  And that William Shakespeare was nothing more than a whoring buffoon with money on his mind.The amount of effort that went into this production is phenomenol.  But alas, it is for naught (oops, did I mispell a word?  Naughty me), as the obligatorily and mercifully free from intelligence and analysis thereof, have taken camera, lights, sets, stage and location in hand, and created a visually appealing, but substance-lacking, cinematic experience.Me, I think I would've preferred to rent ""Porky's"" than watch this drivel again.  A real piece of cinematic trash that belongs on the ash pile of history.Having worked with and known many actors (including some current coworkers) I'd like to think that any person, regardless of their walk of life, their vocation, profession, avenue they've taken, will stand on their own two feet and say ""You know, I wonder about this subject, and I just don't really know, but here's what I think...""  Yet, born and bread to be inserted into a clique and servitude of social popularity, those involved with the film, save one man, will not.  They will don their skills, ""act"" as if outraged that the truth has been with held for nearly a millennial, and then smirk to those who believe in them that the ""crazies"" have finally had their say with their piece of work.Could a production team be any more insulting?Skip this film.It's trash.",1,A Travesty,1321833600,"11 21, 2011",2011,3663,"['question', 'authorship', 'regarding', 'first', 'folio', 'very', 'valid', 'one', 'So', 'when', 'SFX', 'bonanza', 'director', 'camera', 'crew', 'cast', 'hand', 'create', 'one', 'most', 'appalling', 'addresses', 'issue', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'wonder', 'possessed', 'even', 'consider', 'making', 'script', 'first', 'place.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'smacks', 'paranoid', 'fantasy', 'gone', 'awry', 'someone', 'took', 'syringe', 'paranoid', 'serum', 'injected', 'celluloid', 'hard', 'drive', 'images', 'were', 'gathered', 'screenwriter', 'everyone', 'else', 'bandwagon', 'questioning', 'authorship', 'decided', 'get', 'joke', 'make', 'farce', 'film', 'up', 'conspiracy', 'hack', 'nightmare', 'come', 'true.The', 'technical', 'merits', 'film', 'are', 'fine', 'trouncing', 'beliefs', 'critical', 'thinkers', 'who', 'wonder', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'actually', 'penned', 'plays', 'did', 'taken', 'new', 'heights', 'am', 'actor', 'believe', 'emotional', 'correctness', 'position', 'therefore', 'am', 'anybody', 'who', 'dead', 'wrong', 'unworthy', 'consideration', '.I', 'mean', 'wow', 'idea', 'wanting', 'confident', 'persona', 'play', 'part', 'stage', 'play', 'film', 'well', 'fine', 'when', 'people', 'substitute', 'critical', 'analysis', 'emotional', 'hubris', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'glad', 'are', 'not', 'mathematicians', 'detectives', 'judges', 'lawyers', 'chemists', 'physicists', 'engineers', 'stripes', 'other', 'career', 'left', 'brain', 'conviction', 'facts', 'mechanisms', 'churn', 'facts', 'present', 'truth', 'One', 'truly', 'glad', 'that.But', 'person', 'wonders', 'have', 'really', 'considered', 'arguments', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'trying', 'garnish', 'yet', 'set', 'praises', 'appeal', 'sake', 'stroke', 'ego', 'dollar', 'signs', 'Probably', 'later', 'research', 'too', 'long', 'boring', 'emotional', 'investment', 'have', 'friends', 'very', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'being', 'theatre', 'troupe', 'one', 'be', 'confronted', 'cold', 'hard', 'logic', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'minute', 'do', 'tear', 'away', 'being', 'film', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'trash', 'created', 'draw', 'out', 'lunatics', 'society', 'who', 'believe', 'Edward', 'De', 'Vere', 'penned', 'great', 'literary', 'works', 'time', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'whoring', 'buffoon', 'money', 'mind.The', 'amount', 'effort', 'went', 'production', 'phenomenol', 'alas', 'naught', 'oops', 'did', 'mispell', 'word', 'Naughty', 'obligatorily', 'mercifully', 'free', 'intelligence', 'analysis', 'thereof', 'have', 'taken', 'camera', 'lights', 'sets', 'stage', 'location', 'hand', 'created', 'visually', 'appealing', 'substance-lacking', 'cinematic', 'experience.Me', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'rent', 'Porky', 'watch', 'drivel', 'again', 'real', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'trash', 'ash', 'pile', 'history.Having', 'worked', 'known', 'many', 'actors', 'including', 'current', 'coworkers', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'person', 'regardless', 'walk', 'life', 'vocation', 'profession', 'avenue', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'will', 'stand', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'say', 'know', 'wonder', 'subject', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'here', 'what', 'think', 'born', 'bread', 'be', 'inserted', 'clique', 'servitude', 'social', 'popularity', 'involved', 'film', 'save', 'one', 'man', 'will', 'not', 'will', 'don', 'skills', 'act', 'outraged', 'truth', 'been', 'held', 'nearly', 'millennial', 'then', 'smirk', 'who', 'believe', 'crazies', 'have', 'finally', 'had', 'say', 'piece', 'work.Could', 'production', 'team', 'be', 'more', 'insulting', 'Skip', 'film.It', 'trash']",Anonymous

I never cared. Fodder for scholars? Not here. This is one of the best movies I've seen this year. If you want to see a movie with intellectual depth, suspense, intrigue, this is it.Why? That is the big question and this movie poses a tantalizing premise of not only who wrote the plays, the Earl of Oxford, but why he wrote them and why he could have had his head loped off if he had signed them. Shakespeare is portrayed as a semi-illiterate patsy, selected by intermediary Ben Johnson, who would go on the be the most beloved poet of his day. I won't give away more plot except to say that the movie implies that nearly ALL of the plays credited to the (supposedly) illiterate Shakespeare were political, portraits about the Elizabethan times, Midsummer's Night, Julius Caesar, King Leer, especially Richard the Third, were all oblique and therefore potentially treasonous commentaries about contemporary Elizabethan court and government figures. What happened to Kit Marlowe? Murder , mystery, intrigue.This movie presents a really diffferent slant on various semingly unrelated historical events. Whether you agree or not with the author's premise, it's a clever, interesting movie. A different slant.You have to get used to the available light, candlelight, torchlight shots, and in the beginning the movie jumps back and forth present,  and past and a large cast of character at various stages of their life, but this is a movie you can really get your teeth into. A really different look at Elizabethan times, for those familiar with the subject. Vanessa Redgrave plays a part she has played for the last 40 some years, Elizabeth I, Rhys Ifans plays the Earl of Oxford.  Very Plausible! A contemporary Derek Jacobi comes in at the beginning and end with some shocking Shakespear details.Highest recommendation.

1513453,A1JM0VX0AK5UA9,B0068MNNOE,"Richard A. Nathan ""Fan of Shakespeare""","[25, 44]","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.As a firm believer that William Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the plays attributed to him, I thought that ""Anonymous"" would make my blood boil with its myriad historical inaccuracies and its nonsensical conspiracy theories. Instead, it nearly put me to sleep. None of the characters aroused any interest or sympathy. None of the characters had any life, so how could they interest me? None of the characters had a character arc, meaning that no one significantly changes or grew during the film. (Well, that's not completely true. The young de Vere played by Jamie Campbell Bower seemed to be an immature horn dog, while the older de Vere played by Rhys Ifans seems to have no interest in sex at all, but that wasn't character growth - that was an unlikeable character mysteriously becoming a very different unlikeable character with no explanation for the change.) As Edward de Vere, Rhys Ifans attempted to show his poetic soul by looking constipated. He didn't show a shred of humor, which is decidedly odd for a man who supposedly (if he was the real author, as the Oxfordians would have it) wrote more comedies than tragedies. His character claims that art must be political or else it is merely decorative, but he never expressed any political beliefs in the film. He had a personal grudge against the Cecil family, but there is a difference between the personal and the political. (By the way, I find the statement that art must be political or else it is merely decorative to be the most offensive thing in the entire film.)According to the film, Edward's consummate goal was to install Essex on the throne rather than James. But why did he care? Was it some sort of prejudice against the Scottish? Was it out of some sort of affection for Elizabeth? He lusted for her as a youth, but we never see him show any affection for her as a woman, rather than as sex object (when they were young). (And if he had felt any deep affection for Elizabeth, one would have to question why he would care for such an empty-headed libertine.) Did de Vere actually think Essex's political policies were superior to James's political policies? If so, why didn't the film ever differentiate between their policies? Does this mean that Oxford would have thought the screenplay of ""Anonymous"" was merely decorative?As played by Ifans, de Vere didn't seem to have a passion for anything, or any joy in living. He didn't even enjoy writing - he wrote to keep his ""voices"" from troubling him. (At the very end of the film, he shows some love for his son, but by that point it was too late for me to care about this cold fish.)Perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised that I was bored. I have long thought that it would be difficult to make a film with Oxford as the hero of an ""Oxfordian"" movie, because you would either have to portray him as a prig who was ashamed of writing ""Hamlet,"" or as someone who would like to have taken credit, but was too big a wimp to say anything. This film manages to portray Oxford (at least when he is Ifans) as both a wimp and a prig.The film did not bother me primarily for the way it treated William Shakespeare. It bothered me primarily because it was so damned boring.Even if you accept the premises of the film, it doesn't make sense on its own terms. Queen Elizabeth is not presented as a Puritan (quite the opposite) and she clearly enjoys plays. Why, at the very end of the film, does she suddenly insist that de Vere's name never be on the plays? That comes completely out of left field. And Robert Cecil is supposed to be an ultimate political games-player and spy master. Why doesn't he know that the man he installs as King likes plays? Why did de Vere first learn about the power of plays to move people when he was a mature man (played by Ifans) who attended a public performance of a play by Ben Jonson? According to the film, de Vere had already written ""Romeo & Juliet"" and the ""Henry IV"" plays and had them performed atcourt - wouldn't he have already known about the power of plays to movepeople???The second most offensive thing in the film (i.e., after the statement that art must be political or it is merely decorative) was changing the line ""that can sing both high and low"" to ""that can kiss both high and low"" - turning it into a cheap oral sex joke.",1,An Awful Film For Many Reasons,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,4325,"['THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS.As', 'firm', 'believer', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'Stratford', 'wrote', 'plays', 'attributed', 'thought', 'Anonymous', 'would', 'make', 'blood', 'boil', 'myriad', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'nonsensical', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'Instead', 'nearly', 'put', 'sleep', 'None', 'characters', 'aroused', 'interest', 'sympathy', 'None', 'characters', 'had', 'life', 'how', 'could', 'interest', 'None', 'characters', 'had', 'character', 'arc', 'meaning', 'one', 'significantly', 'grew', 'film', 'Well', 'not', 'completely', 'true', 'young', 'de', 'Vere', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Campbell', 'Bower', 'seemed', 'be', 'immature', 'horn', 'dog', 'older', 'de', 'Vere', 'played', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'have', 'interest', 'sex', 'was', ""n't"", 'character', 'growth', 'was', 'unlikeable', 'character', 'mysteriously', 'becoming', 'very', 'different', 'unlikeable', 'character', 'explanation', 'change', 'Edward', 'Vere', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'attempted', 'show', 'poetic', 'soul', 'looking', 'constipated', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'shred', 'humor', 'decidedly', 'odd', 'man', 'who', 'supposedly', 'was', 'real', 'author', 'Oxfordians', 'would', 'have', 'wrote', 'more', 'comedies', 'tragedies', 'character', 'claims', 'art', 'must', 'be', 'political', 'else', 'merely', 'decorative', 'never', 'expressed', 'political', 'beliefs', 'film', 'had', 'personal', 'grudge', 'Cecil', 'family', 'difference', 'personal', 'political', 'way', 'find', 'statement', 'art', 'must', 'be', 'political', 'else', 'merely', 'decorative', 'be', 'most', 'offensive', 'thing', 'entire', 'film', 'According', 'film', 'Edward', 'consummate', 'goal', 'was', 'install', 'Essex', 'throne', 'rather', 'James', 'why', 'did', 'care', 'Was', 'sort', 'prejudice', 'Scottish', 'Was', 'sort', 'affection', 'Elizabeth', 'lusted', 'youth', 'never', 'see', 'show', 'affection', 'woman', 'rather', 'sex', 'object', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'had', 'felt', 'deep', 'affection', 'Elizabeth', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'question', 'why', 'would', 'care', 'such', 'empty-headed', 'libertine', 'Did', 'de', 'Vere', 'actually', 'think', 'Essex', 'political', 'policies', 'were', 'superior', 'James', 'political', 'policies', 'so', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'ever', 'differentiate', 'policies', 'mean', 'Oxford', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'screenplay', 'Anonymous', 'was', 'merely', 'decorative', 'played', 'Ifans', 'Vere', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'passion', 'anything', 'joy', 'living', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'enjoy', 'writing', 'wrote', 'keep', 'voices', 'troubling', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'love', 'son', 'point', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'care', 'cold', 'fish', 'Perhaps', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'was', 'bored', 'have', 'long', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'make', 'film', 'Oxford', 'hero', 'Oxfordian', 'movie', 'would', 'either', 'have', 'portray', 'prig', 'who', 'was', 'ashamed', 'writing', 'Hamlet', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'taken', 'credit', 'was', 'too', 'big', 'wimp', 'say', 'anything', 'film', 'portray', 'Oxford', 'least', 'when', 'Ifans', 'wimp', 'prig.The', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'primarily', 'way', 'treated', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'bothered', 'primarily', 'was', 'so', 'damned', 'boring.Even', 'accept', 'premises', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'own', 'terms', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'not', 'presented', 'Puritan', 'quite', 'opposite', 'clearly', 'plays', 'Why', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'suddenly', 'insist', 'de', 'Vere', 'name', 'never', 'be', 'plays', 'completely', 'left', 'field', 'Robert', 'Cecil', 'supposed', 'be', 'ultimate', 'political', 'games-player', 'spy', 'master', 'Why', ""n't"", 'know', 'man', 'King', 'plays', 'Why', 'did', 'de', 'Vere', 'first', 'power', 'plays', 'move', 'people', 'when', 'was', 'mature', 'man', 'played', 'Ifans', 'who', 'attended', 'public', 'performance', 'play', 'Ben', 'Jonson', 'According', 'film', 'de', 'Vere', 'had', 'already', 'written', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Henry', 'IV', 'plays', 'had', 'performed', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'already', 'known', 'power', 'plays', 'movepeople', 'second', 'most', 'offensive', 'thing', 'film', 'i.e.', 'statement', 'art', 'must', 'be', 'political', 'merely', 'decorative', 'was', 'changing', 'line', 'can', 'sing', 'high', 'low', 'can', 'kiss', 'high', 'low', 'turning', 'cheap', 'oral', 'sex', 'joke']",Anonymous

I read that the Red One just didn't render the light practicals (the lights that are used in a scene rather than placed out of the scene) well; at least the candles which apparently were the main source of light for much of the film (as well, of course, exterior lighting).The story has been related elsewhere completely and in detail, so I won't re-invent the wheel.

The acting was excellent as well, and features Rhys Ifans as the Earl of Oxford (the supposed author of the plays) and Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth.Over-all, the film would appeal more to the history buff, especially someone who is familiar with the English history of the time.

1513465,A2S8LOJ20Y3S0F,B0068MNNOE,Steve,"[2, 2]","Roland Emmerich has specialized in destroying the world on screen: by alien invasion (Independence Day); monsters (Godzilla); climate change (The Day After Tomorrow); and fulfillment of an ancient prophecy (2012). In the films, humanity (or some of it) manages to survive. 2012 is all special effects, with no real characters or story. But the first two films are wildly entertaining if you don't take them too seriously. Emmerich knows his genres, and the films are full of sly allusions to 1950's alien invasion and giant monster spectacles, with dialog that owes something to Hollywood screwball comedies. The Day After Tomorrow is more serious, with a plausible climate change premise that Emmerich expands to the limit.In Anonymous, Emmerich adopts the same strategy. All the characters and incidents start with a premise that seems plausible (if you don't look too closely at it) and is then developed to the grotesque limit. Historians and Shakespeare scholars may be outraged, but they miss the point. The main purpose of films (like Shakespeare's plays) is to be entertaining. And the main pleasure of this film (to someone who is familiar with the plays and some of the Shakespeare scholarship) is to see how the film develops its premises: that Edward DeVere was a brilliant writer who could only express himself in plays and poetry; that Shakespeare was a semi-literate schemer; and Elizabeth a promiscuous and insecure woman completely dependent on the diabolical Cecils. None of these premises will bear close examination, but neither will some of the premises of most other films about Shakespeare (Shakespeare In Love) or Queen Elizabeth (Elizabeth and its sequel Elizabeth: The Golden Age). But these are films, not scholarly treatises, and if they get enough historical detail right so that you can suspend your disbelief, they can be very entertaining, even if you know the history.Even if you believe (like almost all Elizabethan scholars) that Shakespeare's plays were written by Shakespeare, Anonymous is a very entertaining film provided that you don't take it too seriously, and enjoy seeing how an alternate view of history can be developed from a few apparently plausible premises.",4,World destroyer takes aim at Shakespeare,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,2207,"['Roland', 'Emmerich', 'specialized', 'destroying', 'world', 'screen', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Independence', 'Day', 'monsters', 'Godzilla', 'climate', 'change', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'fulfillment', 'ancient', 'prophecy', '2012', 'films', 'humanity', 'survive', '2012', 'special', 'effects', 'real', 'characters', 'story', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'Emmerich', 'genres', 'films', 'are', 'full', 'sly', 'allusions', '1950', 'alien', 'invasion', 'giant', 'monster', 'spectacles', 'dialog', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'more', 'serious', 'plausible', 'climate', 'change', 'premise', 'Emmerich', 'limit.In', 'Anonymous', 'Emmerich', 'same', 'strategy', 'characters', 'incidents', 'start', 'premise', 'plausible', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'closely', 'then', 'developed', 'grotesque', 'limit', 'Historians', 'Shakespeare', 'scholars', 'may', 'be', 'outraged', 'miss', 'point', 'main', 'purpose', 'films', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'be', 'entertaining', 'main', 'pleasure', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'familiar', 'plays', 'Shakespeare', 'scholarship', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'premises', 'Edward', 'DeVere', 'was', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'who', 'could', 'only', 'express', 'plays', 'poetry', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'semi-literate', 'schemer', 'Elizabeth', 'promiscuous', 'insecure', 'woman', 'completely', 'dependent', 'diabolical', 'Cecils', 'None', 'premises', 'will', 'bear', 'close', 'examination', 'will', 'premises', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'Shakespeare', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Elizabeth', 'sequel', 'Elizabeth', 'Golden', 'Age', 'are', 'films', 'not', 'scholarly', 'treatises', 'get', 'enough', 'historical', 'detail', 'right', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'even', 'know', 'history.Even', 'believe', 'almost', 'Elizabethan', 'scholars', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'were', 'written', 'Shakespeare', 'Anonymous', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'provided', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'how', 'alternate', 'view', 'history', 'can', 'be', 'developed', 'few', 'apparently', 'plausible', 'premises']",Anonymous

""An actor, for God's sake!"" But Shakespeare it is, and Oxford continues to launder his material through this semi-literate idiot.This film is based upon a class-obsessed,anti-democratic agenda,looking back to feudalism rather than forward to modernity,based upon Looney's counterfactual bible,for true believers,rather than believers in truth.Yet a good film.Rylance turns in a radiant performance as an actor at the Globe,Armesto is excellent as Ben Jonson,Redgrave plays Elizabeth in her dotage and Hogg is brilliant as Robert Cecil.It's fitting that De Vere is plagued by voices he writes into the plays.Some of the chronology gets lost as the film jumps in the darkly lit scenes.Ben Jonson,now there's a subject,life and works,for film treatment!",3,Counterfactual history based on a Looney tune,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,3074,"['Watching', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'Anonymous', 'made', 'realize', 'what', 'ridiculous', 'lengths', 'have', 'go', 'when', 'cite', 'other', 'usually', 'more', 'noble', 'men', 'be', 'true', 'authors', 'Shakespeare', 'plays.Here', 'Gloriana', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'whore', 'hussy', 'having', 'illegitimate', 'children', 'place.The', 'Earl', 'Oxford', 'son', 'lover', 'really', 'being', 'supposed', 'author', 'works', 'Shakespeare', 'who', 'here', 'depicted', 'illiterate', 'buffoon', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'sign', 'name.The', 'Earl', 'Southampton', 'De', 'Vere', 'son.Ben', 'Jonson', 'messenger', 'works', 'De', 'Vere', 'pen', 'slagging', 'off', 'Shakespeare', 'fraud', 'unable', 'get', 'own', 'works', 'put', 'on.Marlowe', 'killed', 'Shakespeare.Behind', 'snobbish', 'idea', 'only', 'aristocratic', 'education', 'could', 'produce', 'Shakespeare', 'range', 'reference', 'Oxford', 'study', 'books', 'astrolabes', 'stuffed', 'exotica', '.This', 'not', 'just', 'what', 'fantasy', 'propaganda', 'campaign', 'unseat', 'bard', 'backing', 'actors', 'Jacobi', 'Rylance', 'Redgave', 'Richardson', 'publically', 'casting', 'doubt', 'Shakespeare', 'authorship.Emmerich', 'conspiracy', 'film', 'not', 'reveal', 'true', 'author', 'world', 'surveillance', 'not', 'shred', 'documentary', 'evidence', 'connects', 'De', 'Vere', 'plays', 'died', '1604', '10', 'Jacobean', 'plays', 'were', 'written.German', 'director', 'American', 'scriptwriter', 'flippantly', 'English', 'past.A', '9', 'year', 'old', 'De', 'Vere', 'A', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'young', 'queen.We', 'see', 'various', 'stagings', 'plays', 'aloof', 'discrete', 'eye', 'De', 'Vere', 'magisterial', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'viewed', 'narrow', 'prism', 'Elizabethan', 'court', 'politics-so', 'screenwriter', 'Orloff', 'Hamlet', 'parodies', 'Lord', 'Burleigh', 'queen', 'aged', 'counsellor', 'Richard', 'III', 'hunchbacked', 'son', 'Robert', 'Cecil.If', 'realise', 'film', 'theory', 'not', 'based', 'fact', 'then', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'can', 'enjoy', 'aid', 'CGI', 'stunning', 'capture', 'architectural', 'details', 'mud-splatttered', 'streets', 'London', 'seeping', 'sewage', 'meticulously-crafted', 'well-acted', 'film.We', 'get', 'lush', 'interior', 'court', 'scenes', 'candle-lit', 'chambers', 'swarming', 'groundlings', 'brilliantly-realised', 'Globe', 'theatre', 'bear', 'portays', 'De', 'Vere', 'understated', 'melancholy', 'gracefulness', 'actor', 'actor', 'God', 'sake', 'Shakespeare', 'Oxford', 'launder', 'material', 'semi-literate', 'idiot.This', 'film', 'based', 'class-obsessed', 'anti-democratic', 'agenda', 'looking', 'back', 'feudalism', 'rather', 'forward', 'modernity', 'based', 'Looney', 'counterfactual', 'bible', 'true', 'believers', 'rather', 'believers', 'truth.Yet', 'good', 'film.Rylance', 'turns', 'radiant', 'performance', 'actor', 'Globe', 'Armesto', 'excellent', 'Ben', 'Jonson', 'Redgrave', 'Elizabeth', 'dotage', 'Hogg', 'brilliant', 'Robert', 'Cecil.It', 'fitting', 'De', 'Vere', 'plagued', 'voices', 'plays.Some', 'chronology', 'lost', 'film', 'jumps', 'darkly', 'lit', 'scenes.Ben', 'Jonson', 'now', 'subject', 'life', 'works', 'film', 'treatment']",Anonymous

A movie that explores the theory that Shakespeare didn't write any of the things that he is said to. The theory is that The Earl of Oxford (Ifans) wrote them all as a stab at the new Queen (Redgrave) of England. I have said this before but I am not a Shakespeare fan at all, I just don't get him. There are a few movies of his I like but for the most part I am not a fan. Needless to say before watching this I was not that excited at all. Almost instantly the movie grabbed me and I was hooked. For those like me this is not really about Shakespeare at all, but more of a political thriller about trying to start and control a rebellion against Queen Elizabeth I in the 1600's. Weather this is true or not to me doesn't matter but the idea of writing plays as a way to begin a rebellion is a very interesting theory and makes for a very interesting movie.

1513470,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B0068MNNOE,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[0, 2]","I love Elizabethan costume drama. Not sure why. Maybe it's the costumes, or the characters.Elizabeth I has a pivotal role in this film, although it is not really about her. But it is always fun to watch her strut her stuff on the screen.Elizabeth I, who was obviously a real monarch, is such a powerful personage that she makes a great film character. And she does in this movie, which is half the reason for watching it.Vanessa Redgrave's Elizabeth is a lavish, but aged, confused, and weak Queen who is frightened and vulnerable - very different from what we are used to in 'Bess Movies'. She's also the female equivalent of a 'stud', having given birth to many illegitimate children, in secret, of course - yeah, sure.The historical Bess was as much an actress as a monarch. The design of her clothes was chosen carefully to make her look larger than life. He father, Henry VIII started the trend, but then he WAS larger than life, at over 6 feet tall, and by the end of his life, so heavy (let's avoid the unkind word 'fat') that he had to be carried on a litter.Like Henry, Bess held a lavish court to impress diplomats and visiting dignitaries. England was an emerging power and needed to look the part. Court drama and intrigue were in high gear, or so we are told in our time.Which brings to mind the words: ""All the world's a stage..."" Truth and fiction become mixed and indistinguishable. And this film is a perfect example of it, but it's fun to watch, none the less.And of course, Elizabeth reigned when Will Shakespeare was writing all those boffo plays and sonnets. Or did he?That's the absurd yet tantalizing crux of this movie, that Shakespeare was a manipulative blackmailing fraud and the Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere, was the true author of all Shakespeare's works. Only he had to stay anonymous for political and social reasons, and the religious fanatics, the Cecil's, didn't like him, or he didn't like them, and he was in a loveless marriage of inconvenience, or blackmail, or something - it's all very confusing. Again, why the film is fun, it keeps you as off balance as the entire concept is unbalanced!So watch it with tongue-in-cheek and wink-of-eye. Then it works and works well.It's an intriguing concept, but a bit of a mash up as a film. I dismissed the plausibility of the premise as soon as I saw that Edward de Vere was wearing more eye makeup than Elizabeth I (the Queen of Makeup) herself! Although it really made his face stand out and brought out his features, anyone who can out do Elizabeth in the make up department - and not be confined to the Tower - is obviously not for real!Which leaves the film to be enjoyed for what I feel it really is, a highly fanciful historical costume drama.I liked the film, for its costumes (Elizabeth was really well decked out!), the court intrigue (those evil puritanical, fanatical, pro-Scottish Cecils), and the commoner's intrigue -- Shakespeare, Marlow and Jonson all plotting against and threatening each other in between visits to the ale house and brothel -- with an occasional play thrown in to keep us on track.I recommend the film for the fun of seeing Elizabethan England yet again, with the contrasts between the squalor and the opulence (the squalor being the common folk, the opulence, the court).Watch it for the great actors - all of them -  and their convincing portrayals of historical characters who are so distorted that they are fictional (if they were accurate, they'd have been unbelievably dull). History is written by the victors, or something like that!Enjoy it for the fantasy that Elizabeth I, far from being the ""Virgin Queen"", was the mother of many who became nobles.Yes, in this adventure, Bess has children, SEVERAL children yet does not know who they are (not even their names), but the Cecil's do? Uh huh, one of the greatest political leaders and strategists of England is clueless about her secret offspring... okay...And, she -- one of the most publicly recognized and closely guarded monarchs in history (she was under threat of death by Pope Pius V who had excommunicated her, among other problems) -- does this in secret-- in a world where secrets were really hard to keep? Look at Henry's reign, everyone was telling on everyone else! Wonderfully absurd!That should be a giveaway that the movie is a mash up. If they threw in a few zombies (I think I saw some in the Globe Theater audience) it could not have been more absurd!But it is not the absurdity of the premise of the film that should be an issue. This can be dismissed as an elaborate joke on us.If done so, I think you can enjoy the film for the interplay of the characters, the brilliant acting, the very well composed dialog (okay, Shakespeare wrote half of it anyway), the cinematography the costumes, the sets. All this is very well done and there is enough eye candy to satisfy any historical fan. As cinema, this is a very fine and well crafted movie.I admit, there aren't any high speed car chases (how'd they miss out on those?) but there are some pseudo explosions (mostly staged explosions and cannon fire) for fans of such stuff.They also used an intriguing approach to the whole thing by wrapping it in a kind of flashback.The film opens in modern day New York supposedly as a stage play itself, narrated by noted Shakespearean actor, Derek Jacobi. As Jacobi (always a treat) narrates, the film morphs from stage to full screen and we are transported to Elizabethan London. At the end of the film (after everyone dies), we are transported back with equal grace and hear some very serious conjecturing about the truth and validity of the whole thing, and the glory of the plays and sonnets (which at least IS true). As silly as that is, it moved me because I really liked the characters and was still getting over their dying off. That's the problem with historical fiction, everyone dies in the end. Nevertheless, I liked this approach in the film, I thought it was clever.The film also does two things that most historical dramas ignore:1. It actually rains - a LOT - in England. What a concept!2. The interiors are all dark, in spite of many, many candles burning as brightly as they can. (The lighting in this film must have been very tricky to engineer)We know from history and climate that this, at least, is accurate. It was a wet, dank, dark, dirty age.So we have some 'authentic' stuff mixed in with the most fantastical plot, confusing the whole thing for us.Yet it is an enjoyable film and a 'who-done-it-to-whom.'I say, enjoy the confusion -- especially the flashbacks that make it impossible until the end to know what's really going on. Robert Cecil, like any good villain, can't help but brag at the end when he's truly defeated Edward de Vere (whom he hates with a passion) just how he did it! Thank goodness, I'd never have figured it out otherwise!Bottom Line:This is a very well crafted and fun film when taken for what it is, an elaborate fantasy suggesting alternative history. It's a fun ride to explore 'what if Shakespeare didn't write his plays'. It's fun to go back in time and once more see how bad living conditions were -- maybe we wouldn't complain so much if we appreciated how far we have come.And there's Elizabeth I.Any film with her in it is a must see for me.",5,A Fun Film - Entertaining Costume Drama and Mash Up,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,7287,"['love', 'Elizabethan', 'costume', 'drama', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'Maybe',

I was so excited to see this movie when I learned of it. The theory that Shakespeare never wrote his own plays was one that I'd heard in college and always thought of as intriguing. I've also read several books about Elizabeth and her court so I was also familiar with many of the main characters that the movie portrays. Unfortunately the writers of the movie must have assumed that the movie's viewers wouldn't know anything about that era of history since they either distorted, changed, or even omitted many historical figures to suit their own ends. I know that it isn't a documentary, and shouldn't be treated as such. It is classified as fiction so we should allow for some licence to be taken. Honestly I've never seen a movie set during this era that was completely accurate. But the liberties taken here are the worst I've seen! In my opinion the movie's premise would be more credible if it demonstrated a higher level of accuracy with the time period. I love the look and feel of the movie, and I wanted to like this movie so much more than I actually did.

G Zinzel ""zzinzel""","[3, 7]","I am rather new to this issue, and normally against most ""Conspiracy"" Theories; but IMHO, the Shakespeare Authorship Controversy IS a legitimate mystery.If you listen to the commentary on this DVD, the film makers honestly admit that they took liberties with the factual record while making this movie. They acknowledge several of those liberties, and openly imply that there are others that they didn't elaborate on. This is one reason why I wish films like this would ALWAYS include additional commentaries by 'real' historians who comment on the facts relating to the action on-screen, but I'm not aware of ANY movie that has this type of commentary.AS RELATES TO THE AUTHORSHIP QUESTION- IMHO there is little doubt that the man from Stratford-on-Avon is not the author of the works attributed to him.(1) It is undisputed that the Stratford=Shakespeare was a well-known stage-actor, and part-owner of theater(s); but the record of him ACTUALLY writing those works, is mostly built on ASSUMPTIONS, i.e, that he simply MUST HAVE, written them.Which is actually the same argument about his education. We KNOW nothing-nada-zip-zilch about his education, but, in a similar vein, the traditionalists insist that he certainly MUST HAVE gotten an education similar to what they propose.(2) It is unknown about whether Stratford-Shakespeare was literate or not.It is almost certain, that his father, who was, at various times in his life, VERY SUCCESSFUL in business, and in local politics, was illiterate, and signed legal documents using the method of ""making a mark"".One of Stratford-Shakespeare's daughters seems to have been fairly literate, while the other one, probably not.The Stratford-Shakespeare was VERY financially successful, and as a Stage-Actor, he certainly must have known how to read, in order to learn his lines.BUT, in spite, of all the amazing output from ""Shakespeare-the-Author"", there is not one surviving document written by the hand of 'William Shakespeare' from Stratford-on-Avon, nor is there any known document that ever existed, and is now known to have been lost.There is a very rich public record of many activities and events in the Statford-Shakespeare's life, but the only things in existence from his own hand, are SIX(6) signatures, all of which are virtually unrecognizable- AND THIS IS THE SMOKING GUN.(3) IF THE MAN FROM STRATFORD DIDN'T WRITE THAT STUFF, WHO DID ??? There are lots of good theories, but none of them without problems. And this is a wonderful mystery to investigate, which will probably never be solved.(4) FINALLY, I learned lots of little tidbits in from this film; mostly about the Cecil's",5,"GREAT FILM, IMO, but this is historical fiction, not a documentary",1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,2644,"['am', 'rather', 'new', 'issue', 'normally', 'most', 'Conspiracy', 'Theories', 'IMHO', 'Shakespeare', 'Authorship', 'Controversy', 'legitimate', 'mystery.If', 'listen', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'film', 'makers', 'honestly', 'admit', 'took', 'liberties', 'factual', 'record', 'making', 'movie', 'acknowledge', 'several', 'liberties', 'openly', 'imply', 'are', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'elaborate', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'wish', 'films', 'would', 'ALWAYS', 'include', 'additional', 'commentaries', ""'real"", 'historians', 'who', 'comment', 'facts', 'relating', 'action', 'on-screen', ""'m"", 'not', 'aware', 'ANY', 'movie', 'type', 'commentary.AS', 'RELATES', 'TO', 'THE', 'AUTHORSHIP', 'QUESTION-', 'IMHO', 'little', 'doubt', 'man', 'Stratford-on-Avon', 'not', 'author', 'works', 'attributed', '1', 'undisputed', 'Stratford=Shakespeare', 'was', 'well-known', 'stage-actor', 'part-owner', 'theater', 's', 'record', 'ACTUALLY', 'writing', 'works', 'mostly', 'built', 'ASSUMPTIONS', 'i.e', 'simply', 'MUST', 'HAVE', 'written', 'them.Which', 'actually', 'same', 'argument', 'education', 'KNOW', 'nothing-nada-zip-zilch', 'education', 'similar', 'vein', 'traditionalists', 'insist', 'certainly', 'MUST', 'HAVE', 'gotten', 'education', 'similar', 'what', 'propose', '2', 'unknown', 'Stratford-Shakespeare', 'was', 'literate', 'not.It', 'almost', 'certain', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'various', 'times', 'life', 'VERY', 'SUCCESSFUL', 'business', 'local', 'politics', 'was', 'illiterate', 'signed', 'legal', 'documents', 'using', 'method', 'making', 'mark', '.One', 'Stratford-Shakespeare', 'daughters', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'literate', 'other', 'one', 'probably', 'not.The', 'Stratford-Shakespeare', 'was', 'VERY', 'financially', 'successful', 'Stage-Actor', 'certainly', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'how', 'read', 'order', 'learn', 'lines.BUT', 'spite', 'amazing', 'output', 'Shakespeare-the-Author', 'not', 'one', 'surviving', 'document', 'written', 'hand', ""'William"", 'Shakespeare', 'Stratford-on-Avon', 'there', 'known', 'document', 'ever', 'existed', 'now', 'known', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'rich', 'public', 'record', 'many', 'activities', 'events', 'Statford-Shakespeare', 'life', 'only', 'things', 'existence', 'own', 'hand', 'are', 'SIX', '6', 'signatures', 'are', 'virtually', 'unrecognizable-', 'AND', 'THIS', 'THE', 'SMOKING', 'GUN', '3', 'MAN', 'FROM', 'STRATFORD', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'WRITE', 'THAT', 'STUFF', 'WHO', 'DID', 'are', 'lots', 'good', 'theories', 'none', 'problems', 'wonderful', 'mystery', 'investigate', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'be', 'solved', '4', 'FINALLY', 'learned', 'lots', 'little', 'tidbits', 'film', 'mostly', 'Cecil']",Anonymous
