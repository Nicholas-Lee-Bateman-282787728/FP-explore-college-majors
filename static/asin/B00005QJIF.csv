McKaig,"[2, 2]","I wasn't sure what to expect with this one but the plot sounded interesting and anything with Adrienne Barbeau is worth the price of admission.Some of the acting is rough and the plot is on the skimpy side but once you get into the movie, who cares!  This was a hoot and a half.  Interesting effects and characters and of course upon the first glimpse of Ms. Barbeau as Christine, you feel like you're seeing a familiar friend.This is a fun romp that gives you a taste of horror, comedy, drama, and is good old fashion popcorn movie.  I'd like to thank the writers, producers and actors for making a quiet evening at home much more interesting.I recently met Ms. Barbeau before seeing this movie and when I mentioned it she told me I'd enjoy it and she was on target.  (I also must mention that it was a dream come true to meet this acting Icon and she was an absolute delight!!!).If you want a great movie with a dash of everything this is the one for you.

It just so happens that, according to legend, a massacre occured in this very convent 40 years earlier. Our zany bunch of scholars simply must enter these accursed halls so they can party more effectively. Well, a group of rather un-sinister satanists are already inside, looking for a virgin to sacrifice to their dark lord. Uh-oh! Real demons emerge to spoil everyone's good time! The rest of the evening is spent trying to stay alive. Much blood and goo is sprayed. Enter Christine (Adrienne Barbeau!!!!), who is the same gal that slaughtered a sanctuary full of nuns and a priest on that fateful day in 1960! She is one tough babe, complete w/ motorcycle, a machete, and a huge cache of guns! Together w/ the sole surviving coed, Christine chops off many demonized heads and fires innumerable bullets. Her prayer near the film's explosive climax is what I want chiseled on my headstone! It's my favorite part of the movie.

The humor at times is hilarious (at one point the main character says ""You mean my brother could become the antichrist? My mom's gonna be PISSED!"") and sometimes it's just annoying.Adrienne Barbeau is awesome as the nun-killing ""psycho""...she reminded me of an exaggerated Sigourney Weaver from the alien movies...she is the reason this movie somewhat succeeds.  Other than that, the gore factor is pretty high (lots of blood, head-chopping, etc.).  The main low-point of this movie is the bad acting of ALL the main character teens except the main girl.  Some of their humorous lines would be a lot funnier if they knew how to deliver them.But, if you can look past the bad acting (and the pointless and confusing cameo of Coolio as a pot-smoking cop), this movie does have some redeeming qualities.The DVD has not much to offer except widescreen and a very short, pointless deleted scene.

675383,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B00005QJIF,Carl Manes,"[0, 0]","THE CONVENT may be the most fun I have had with a low-budget Indie Horror film since PLAGA ZOMBIE. It combines elements of CHILDREN SHOULDNT PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS and the classic 80s demon flicks DEMONS and NIGHT OF THE DEMONS in a crazy, gory throwback flick that is sure to please any genre fan! A group of college co-eds head to a haunted convent to screw around, when their drunken debaucheries unleash the evil spirits of the devil-worshiping nuns that were killed by one of their students decades earlier. Director Mike Mendez uses simple make-up appliances and creative use of neon paint with black lighting to bring the demons to life, and though the FX work and techniques are clearly visible, they are equally effective. Though each of the characters are pure stereotypes, they function perfectly in the film since it is entirely self-aware and played up. There is also an excellent balance of horror and comedy that genuinely had me laughing the entire film. The film is also set to a booming electric score that energizes the action sequences and gives the film a much larger feel. If all that wasn't enough, the gore is absolutely over the top and absurdly awesome, with countless decapitations, head explosions, face-ripping, and gut-munching. 100% enjoyable from start to finish, a highly recommended and grossly underrated gorefest!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,The Convent,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,1379,"['CONVENT', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'fun', 'have', 'had', 'low-budget', 'Indie', 'Horror', 'film', 'PLAGA', 'ZOMBIE', 'elements', 'CHILDREN', 'SHOULDNT', 'PLAY', 'WITH', 'DEAD', 'THINGS', 'classic', '80s', 'demon', 'flicks', 'DEMONS', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'DEMONS', 'crazy', 'gory', 'throwback', 'flick', 'sure', 'please', 'genre', 'fan', 'group', 'college', 'co-eds', 'head', 'haunted', 'convent', 'screw', 'around', 'when', 'drunken', 'debaucheries', 'unleash', 'evil', 'spirits', 'devil-worshiping', 'nuns', 'were', 'killed', 'one', 'students', 'decades', 'earlier', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Mendez', 'simple', 'make-up', 'appliances', 'creative', 'use', 'neon', 'paint', 'black', 'lighting', 'bring', 'demons', 'life', 'FX', 'work', 'techniques', 'are', 'clearly', 'visible', 'are', 'equally', 'effective', 'characters', 'are', 'pure', 'stereotypes', 'function', 'perfectly', 'film', 'entirely', 'self-aware', 'played', 'up', 'also', 'excellent', 'balance', 'horror', 'comedy', 'genuinely', 'had', 'laughing', 'entire', 'film', 'film', 'also', 'set', 'booming', 'electric', 'score', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'much', 'larger', 'feel', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'gore', 'absolutely', 'top', 'absurdly', 'awesome', 'countless', 'decapitations', 'head', 'explosions', 'face-ripping', 'gut-munching', '100', '%', 'enjoyable', 'start', 'finish', 'highly', 'recommended', 'grossly', 'underrated', 'gorefest', '-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",The Convent

675388,AJBRZIEQYQOBA,B00005QJIF,Matthew Mclaughlin,"[1, 1]","You know, it was really hard for me to dislike this movie, because I really wanted to like it. I first heard of it having trouble finding a distributor a few years ago, and heard it was outrageous, wild, gory, stylish - and so much more. I thought I was in for something new, but after a rousing start (nice, nice), the film becomes stunningly mediocre. Cardboard characters that have been in every teen fright flick since the late 70's populate the picture, and even the one character who should be original - the goth girl (who is absolutely beautiful) - is basically Angela from the Night of the Demons series. In fact, the echoes of NOTDs are everywhere from the makeup to the gore (yes, NOTDs 2 even had decapitated nuns).At a trim 81 minutes, you'd expect the sensational subject matter to pack a wallop, but outside of the opening and a neat flashback sequence, its all really rather contrived. At times, it seems the filmmakers were trying overly hard to be un-pc, and it does feel a bit juvenile. With such a short running time, there should be no pointless scenes, but instead of wall to wall carnage, we get a couple of scenes in a diner, some inane chatter amongst the teens to establish 'character', and a really cheesy ending.It does have its moments, some good gore, a bit of stylish photography.

675389,A3V2THQU2RQ1AG,B00005QJIF,Molly C.,"[0, 0]","A group of college students (cheerleader, goth, stoner, jock, virgin) decide to visit the old convent that was shut down due to a nasty incident that occurred. The goth chick, Mo, is captured by wannabe devil worshipers and they unwittingly unleash demons. As demons take over the bodies of nice girl Clorissa's boyfriend and friends, only Adult Christine (played awesomely well by Adrienne Barbeau) can stop them.The opening scene sums up what is to follow. A beautiful babe in a school girl outfit and leather jacket with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth slaughters nuns and priests with a baseball bat, shotgun, and matches while ""You Don't Own Me"" plays. If you like this sequence, you will like the rest. Nuttiness ensues involving drugs, virgin sacrifices, forced abortions, gay Satanists, ditzy cheerleaders, and a pugnacious pug. Oh, and Coolio and Bill Moseley make appearances as no-good coppers.It should be noted that this is one of the earlier works from The Gravedancers director, Mike Mendez and won the Audience Award at Fantafestival.I have to say that my favorite scene (other than the opening) was set to the song ""Dreamweaver"" where stoner Biff gets high off shrooms and weed, hears Jesus talking to him, and tries unsuccessfully to mate with a demon.There were incredibly likable characters you watched run around. Goth chick Mo (also in The Gravedancers) is adorable, Stoner dude Biff was hilarious, and Young/ Adult Christine oozed coolness. Unfortunately, none of these great characters get more than a half hour screen time. Instead, we are stuck with the good girl Clorissa.As for the religious undertones, or in this case, way overtones, it is not preachy or sacrilegious. Mendez comes across as showing what is scary about the idea of having to conform within the confines of a convent.I saw that the SFX received bad comments in other reviews, but I felt was okay overall. The make-up was a tad silly in some parts like glow in the dark veins and neon blood. However, the prosthetics used to raise the demons foreheads looked realistic and the ""blood shower"" scene was cool. The ""Antichrist birth"" scene was especially good considering this was low budget and it was only on screen for about one minute.Favorite Quote: Satanist asks, ""Are you the spawn of the Devil?"" Nerd replies, ""No, I'm a Lambda.""... Or when Clorissa says, ""My brother's going to be the next Antichrist? Mom's gonna be pi*ssed."" DVD Extras: Audio Options (inc. Spanish Subtitles), Commentary, Behind the Scenes, 1 Deleted short Scene, and ""Gore on Demand"" which showed the death scenes up close and in slow motion.Bottom Line: A very goofy, fun film with lots of gore.

She gets knocked out and later wakes up tied to a pentagram, about to be sacrificed by a bunch of loser satanists.  Meanhwile, outside, one campus cop, played by Coolio, is a psycho.  Get this, a girl, covered in blood, runs screaming towards him yelling ""help me officer, they're being killed"".  What does he do?  He PULLS HIS GUN ON HER and yells ""stay back creature of the night!"".  What?Then, later on, we are told that the girl who killed all the nuns actually did it to drive away the demons that had taken over the convent.  Get this, the nuns all turned into demons, and started writing ""Hail Satan"" on the blackboard, and NO ONE notices and keeps their kids home.  OOOOoh, that sounds good.  Gee, didn't the nasty, glow in the sark faces and fangs at least make people think maybe there was a problem?  Oh, I forgot about the dumbass satanist wannabes who summon up the evil.  They are lead by a wimp with a highpitched voice.  His followers say wonderful things like ""Am I worthy, master? And, I would die for you, son of Satan"".  Luckily, he gets stabbed in the eye and dies.  I would go on, but I think you get the point.It's a shame, this movie really had potential.  It could have been really scary.

675394,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005QJIF,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","The Convent (Mike Mendez, 2000)I really should check these things out before I decide to watch them. Mendez was responsible, six years after this, for the execrable After Dark movie The Gravedancers. And what a surprise, he resurrected a lot of the cast from his earlier, even stupider movie, The Convent, for that one. Had I known this before I decided to try watching this dog, I would probably have not felt like I just killed, tortuously, the last seventy-nine minutes of my existence. At least The Convent does have a bit of humor, but it's not nearly enough to save this.The story: the opening scene shows us a young woman walking into a convent, pulling out weaponry, and going to town. We skip to forty years later, and one of those hoary old horror film clich&eacute;s--the college students breaking into the haunted building to do some partying. All is your typical brand of creepy until one of the partiers, Mo (Megahn Perry, one of many here who came back for The Gravedancers), runs across a band of amateur Satanists (led by the counter guy at the local Dairy Queen, no less; he provides most of the film's laughs) who are looking for a human sacrifice to initiate a new member. Of course, the ghosts are perfectly happy with a human sacrifice as well, and everything kinda blows up from there...I am convinced, as I was when watching The Gravedancers, that somewhere within Mike Mendez there's a decent filmmaker straining to get out. There were so many places where this movie had potential and failed to live up to it (though it does succeed more than The Gravedancers managed to). A lot of this has to do with Chaton Anderson's script, which never does manage to do anything remotely unpredictable. The actors, for what it's worth, do the best they can with the material they're given, and some of them manage to do something close to shine here, if you take into account the material they're working with. (Again, I hasten to remind the reader that I'm comparing this to The Gravedancers rather than any other horror film I've seen this week.) Mendez looks sometimes like he's going to do something fun, but ultimately sticks with convention from start to finish. This could have been a much, much better film than it ended up being, but, as Mendez' more recent effort shows us, this could have been a whole lot worse as well. * ",2,Someone stop Mike Mendez before he films again!,1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,2348,"['Convent', 'Mike', 'Mendez', '2000', 'really', 'should', 'check', 'things', 'out', 'decide', 'watch', 'Mendez', 'was', 'responsible', 'six', 'years', 'execrable', 'Dark', 'movie', 'Gravedancers', 'what', 'surprise', 'resurrected', 'lot', 'cast', 'earlier', 'even', 'stupider', 'movie', 'Convent', 'one', 'Had', 'known', 'decided', 'try', 'watching', 'dog', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'not', 'felt', 'just', 'killed', 'tortuously', 'last', 'seventy-nine', 'minutes', 'existence', 'least', 'Convent', 'have', 'bit', 'humor', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'save', 'this.The', 'story', 'opening', 'scene', 'young', 'woman', 'walking', 'convent', 'pulling', 'out', 'weaponry', 'going', 'town', 'skip', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'one', 'hoary', 'old', 'horror', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'college', 'students', 'breaking', 'haunted', 'building', 'do', 'partying', 'typical', 'brand', 'creepy', 'one', 'partiers', 'Mo', 'Megahn', 'Perry', 'one', 'many', 'here', 'who', 'came', 'back', 'Gravedancers', 'band', 'amateur', 'Satanists', 'led', 'counter', 'guy', 'local', 'Dairy', 'Queen', 'less', 'most', 'film', 'laughs', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'initiate', 'new', 'member', 'course', 'ghosts', 'are', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'as', 'well', 'everything', 'kinda', 'up', 'am', 'convinced', 'was', 'when', 'watching', 'Gravedancers', 'somewhere', 'Mike', 'Mendez', 'decent', 'filmmaker', 'straining', 'get', 'out', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'places', 'where', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'failed', 'live', 'up', 'succeed', 'more', 'Gravedancers', 'managed', 'lot', 'do', 'Chaton', 'Anderson', 'script', 'never', 'manage', 'do', 'anything', 'remotely', 'unpredictable', 'actors', 'what', 'worth', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'material', ""'re"", 'given', 'manage', 'do', 'something', 'close', 'shine', 'here', 'take', 'account', 'material', ""'re"", 'working', 'Again', 'hasten', 'remind', 'reader', ""'m"", 'comparing', 'Gravedancers', 'rather', 'other', 'horror', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'week', 'Mendez', 'sometimes', 'going', 'do', 'something', 'fun', 'ultimately', 'sticks', 'convention', 'start', 'finish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'Mendez', 'more', 'recent', 'effort', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'whole', 'lot', 'worse', 'as', 'well', '*']",The Convent

Background music, Lesley Gore's hit song, ""You Don't Own Me.""  And she takes out a shotgun, kills all the nuns there, and torches the place.  Ugh.40 years later, as you expect, a group of college students breaks into this now deserted convent for fun.  And you know what happens next, with demon worshippers and massive attack of zombies.  ""The Convent"" is, in fact, a knowingly cheezy B-horror film that is meant for fun, fun like sitting back and drinking beer.  So, there's no point in saying that the story is hackneyed, the characters are caricatures -- a cheerleader, a Goth girl, etc.  If you're in good mood, you may enjoy the film's sheer stupidity.  If you're not, just stay away.For film fans who loves to have any knowledge, trivial or not, the following might be useful.  Coolio appears as a crazy cop, but, remember, his part is just a cameo.  And another special appearance is by Adrienne Barbeau, who is cool clad in black lether jacket, chopping off the zombies' heads.  And Ms. Barbeau's character, an adult released from 40 years' hietus after murdering those nuns (she got some reason, she says), is named ""Christine"" ... the director's obvious homage to one Carpenter film of the same title, and his ""Escape from N.Y."" in which she also appeared.  (And as you know, she is ex-Mrs. Carpenter.)  Brief as it is, her screen presense gives a good stimulant to this film.As to the film itself, the scare is scarcely found, but sometimes it certainly is funny.  The special make-up is very good, and gives precious power to the entire film that tends to sag sometimes.  This is for those who likes the types of films like ""Creepshow"" and ""The Evil Dead.""
