1098701,A28MYC8KKCK2FZ,B000V5IP6K,Alice L. Moore,"[0, 0]","This is a prequel/3rd season+ sequel for Battlestar Galactica.  It introduces a new character, Kendra Shaw.  She is a protege of Admiral Cain from the 2nd season.This is the miniseries to fill in the blanks.  It flashes to the Cylon nuclear attack and how Battlestar Pegasus dealt with it.  If you have seen the 1st miniseries, you will be able to compare and contrast their actions with Battlestar Galactica's actions.  There were the backstories of Admiral Cain's and Adama's formative experiences.  Without giving anything away, these events shape these two leaders philosophies.  The miniseries doesn't seem to try to rationalize or idealize this.  That is positive.  Stephanie Jacobs was outstanding as Kendra Shaw.  It is regrettable that she wasn't made a regular character of BSG.What I didn't like were the multiple flashbacks.  I know this is mostly a backstory series to help us fill in the blanks.  This is fine.  You never know which flashback you were getting when they happened in the film.  The present day plot seemed to be an add-on.I liked the special bonus features; particularly the minisodes that inspired this film.  the Season 4 trailers and teasers were good as well.  This is from someone who usually clicks the ""Next"" button on the DVD remote and ignores ""Bonus Materials"".In summary, if you  like backstory and want to have some of the blanks filled in up to the point of the Season 3 finale this is for you.

Being a sick fan of BSG got the DVD the day it was released.  Now that I watched it must say that the extended version is the way to go.There are a few key flash backs - esp. for the Character Cain that gives you more insight into the actions that take place in the movie. Makes it easier to understand how Cain became such a tough customer when it came to dealing with Cylons.Overall - good piece of TV. While it does suffer for the one thing that drives me nuts when it comes to SCI-Fi = lack of additional funds to make some of the human vs. cyclon battles truly epic.  Sci-Fi should cease flushing their money down the drain when it comes to their stupid Sat Night cheapo flicks and invest in quality programs like BSG. This ""mini-movie"" could have been even bigger and better in its production and where the story goes.That being said - the ""guerilla"" style film making that Moore, the director, and rest of the great production and acting crew really scores a solid B +.  Bear's haunting score over the end credits is beautiful and I can not wait for him to add it to the season 4 CD - check out the rest of his music for some great soundtrack pieces.Worth a view - not as great as the miniseries or the 1st 2 seasons but still much better TV than you get almost anywhere on the old ""idiot box"".So Say We All!",4,THE EXTENDED EDITION IS THE ONLY ONE TO WATCH,1197417600,"12 12, 2007",2007,1396,"['went', 'theatre', 'free', 'pass', 'watched', 'went', 'sci-fi', 'Being', 'sick', 'fan', 'BSG', 'got', 'DVD', 'day', 'was', 'released', 'Now', 'watched', 'must', 'say', 'extended', 'version', 'way', 'are', 'few', 'key', 'flash', 'backs', 'esp', 'Character', 'Cain', 'more', 'insight', 'actions', 'take', 'place', 'movie', 'Makes', 'easier', 'understand', 'how', 'Cain', 'became', 'such', 'tough', 'customer', 'when', 'came', 'dealing', 'Cylons.Overall', 'good', 'piece', 'TV', 'suffer', 'one', 'thing', 'when', 'SCI-Fi', '=', 'lack', 'additional', 'funds', 'make', 'human', 'vs.', 'cyclon', 'battles', 'truly', 'epic', 'Sci-Fi', 'should', 'cease', 'flushing', 'money', 'drain', 'when', 'stupid', 'Sat', 'Night', 'cheapo', 'flicks', 'invest', 'quality', 'programs', 'BSG', 'mini-movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'bigger', 'better', 'production', 'where', 'story', 'goes.That', 'being', 'said', 'guerilla', 'style', 'film', 'making', 'Moore', 'director', 'rest', 'great', 'production', 'acting', 'crew', 'really', 'solid', 'B', '+', 'Bear', 'haunting', 'score', 'end', 'beautiful', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'add', 'season', '4', 'CD', 'check', 'rest', 'music', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'pieces.Worth', 'view', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'miniseries', '1st', '2', 'seasons', 'still', 'much', 'better', 'TV', 'get', 'almost', 'anywhere', 'old', 'idiot', 'box', '.So', 'Say']",N/A
1098703,AJYILFULOQ3CX,B000V5IP6K,a man from the east coast,"[2, 3]","What is the most intriguing in this extended episode is the developement of Helena Cain's character; we are shown in vivid detail why she never, under any circumstances whatsoever, should have been promoted above the rank of ensign.There are plot spoilers to follow, folks.  If you don't want your good time ruined, stop ready this review right now.At one point Helena demands the sidearm of her XO, who is taking a moral stand and refusing to obey one of her illegal orders.  He (rather foolishly) accepts that order, surrenders his sidearm, and is summarily shot in the head by Cain.So now she's shot a man in cold blood.  But wait, there's so much more!It is discovered that Helena's love interest, a woman working on Pegasus' computers, is really a Cylon.  Since Helena is obviously wounded and angered by this betrayal, she proves to all observers that she is no better than the Cylons who exterminated the vast majority of the colonials.How does she achieve this?  Simple:  She orders the Cylon female tortured, so as to extract any and all relevant info the Cylon might have.This is NEVER an acceptable choice.  First, the Cylons would never be so GALACTICALLY STUPID as to send into humanities' midst an infiltrator who had knowledge of vital Cylon intelligence.  The Cylons would realize the high risk of capture and torture, and therefore tell the infiltrator only what she absolutely had to know to do her job, and nothing more.Torturing such an individual is pointless and inhuman ... and it's obviously right up Cain's alley.  She feels betrayed by her former lover, and now she wants vicious revenge.Next, Cain orders that any relevant supplies and technically savvy survivors of a small fleet discovered by Pegasus be brought aboard and utilized for the guerilla war effort initiated by Cain.  She feels no responsibilty to ""defend and protect"" these survivors, and thereby abandon her quest of guerilla warfare (a.k.a mindless, idiotic revenge).  Any refusal will be answered with orders to kill the family of the refuser.  This is put to the test, and several innocent people are killed to gain the compliance of the survivors.Cain does not even try to game out a few scenarios here; she just jumps to the conclusion that the only way to gain the needed supplies and expertise is to threaten vicious retaliation if anyone refuses.Which brings us to another of Helena's many mistakes:  Her brainless notion to wage a guerilla war on the Cylons.After having destroyed the 12 Colonies, the Cylons are obviously in a position of great military superiority over one single Battlestar.  What usually happens in such cases is that the greatly superior (in force and firepower) occupying force just picks the guerillas off, one by one.  The guerillas attack, again and again, and lose blood and treasure each time.  The occupying army, much greater in number and power, simply accepts whatever losses it has to as it continually degrades the force and the efficacy of its adversary.  Cain's plan, had it been carried out, would have eventually resulted in the destruction of the Pegasus.And last, but certainly not least, that brings us to Cain's most spectacular failure:  Her abandonment of her little sister during the first Cylon war.We are shown a flashback sequence in which a very young Helena is shown fleeing the Cylons, her little sister in tow.  However, her sister falls and becomes stuck.  Helena's sister repeatedly cries out to Helena for help, and it is shown quite clearly that Helena hears her sister's pleas and decides to abandon her to the Cylons.The lesson Helena takes from this?""Sometimes we have to leave certain people behind.""The characterization here is fascinating, as Michelle Forbes plays this character as a complex woman, who is highly intelligent and decisive.  Yet perhaps Michelle Forbes' greatest accomplishment here is that her portrayal of Helena Cain is a classic example of the vast difference between one who is dominant, and one who is domineering.  Cain is clearly the latter, being possessed of a deep, insatiable hunger for power, and yet having not a whit of the character necessary to handle being given authority and command.If you're a student of Jungian personality analysis (commonly expressed today in the Myers-Briggs personality type indicator), you'll quickly recognize Cain as a very poorly developed ENTJ (Extroverted, iNtuitive, with Thinking and Judging).  She is very much possessed of the decisiveness and tough-mindedness quite common to ENTJ's, yet her instincts are terrible, as they are constantly overshadowed by Cain's tormented emotions.It is clear that Cain is a miserable human being, thinking that gaining power and control (i.e., being an admiral commanding a battlestar) will somehow change the fact that there is no courage in her heart.  When her little sister was in her hour of desperate need, Helena willfully abandoned her to the Cylons.  Granted, Helena was very little at the time, and that must be taken into account.  Still, Helena never expresses any remorse for what she did, but rather rationalizes it into her pathetic ""razor"" philosophy of doing whatever it takes to survive:  Turning fear into anger, focusing that anger to gain control.""Don't hate your enemies; it clouds your judgment"" wrote Mario Puzo.  Helena Cain was clearly consumed with hatred for the Cylons, although she used her highly intelligent mind to hide this fact rather well.Cain was smart, hungry for power, cowardly, domineering, and devoid of any real concern for anything outside of herself.  Unlike most ENTJ's, she had no grasp of the ""big picture"", no insight into her own illogical and irrational impulses to both take on the impossible and rule as judge, jury, and executioner over anyone who dared to take a stand and oppose her.Michelle Forbes played this role quite well; this is exactly the kind of person you'd never want to see in any position of power whatsoever.  Forbes' portrayal is at one time complex and uncompromising (again, classic personality traits of the ENTJ), while at the same time inspiring the audience to contemplate Cain's actions and attitudes in light of their context.Did Cain have to make the choices she did?  Of course not.  We see Cain's justifications and rationalizations for her actions, but we see through them, too.  Forbes deserves a lot of credit for that, because she plays her part so as to make her character very much understood by the audience, while never trying to persuade the audience to condone or approve of exactly who and what Helena Cain really is.  Forbes does an excellent job of protraying someone who deliberately projects an image of strength, while all the while being the farthest thing from indomitable there is.I strongly recommend this extended version; we get to know Cain better, and it's a fascinating pshchological study of who should never be in charge, and why.",4,intriguing as always; this was a hell of a good

The flashback material, showing cylon centurions and raiders like those from the original show, was a treat, but what makes this movie really compelling is the story of Kendra Shaw.  It's a very tragic, and very human story (spoilers to follow).  Lieutenant Shaw is shown as an outstanding young officer who, in the course of peacetime, would have gone far in the Colonial service.  Had she been posted to the Galactica at the time of the attack, she would doubtless have risen to become one of Adama's most trusted and most valued officers.  Unfortunately, when the cylons attacked she found herself serving under Admiral Cain, a smart, driven leader, but one with a broken moral compass.  In Cain's service, she is induced to commit a war crime, which impresses the admiral, but leads Lieutenant Shaw, in the end, to be consumed with self-loathing.  It's convincingly done.  Shaw having served aboard Pegasus long enough to see how the admiral runs her ship, what she expects from her subordinates, and the way she deals with those who fail to measure up to her standards, Shaw takes an action in a split-second, in the heat of a very tense moment, that can never be undone, and which changes the course of her life.  Deep down, however much she listened to and absorbed Cain's speeches about being a ""razor"" as sharp and hard and cold as steel, and doing absolutely whatever it takes to survive, or to win, no matter the cost and no matter who else pays, Shaw's an innately good enough person to know that some actions are unjustifiable, and she can't forgive herself for the things she's done.The movie also includes as scene which explains, again convincingly, what made Admiral Cain into someone who could act without honor.  We see that when she was a little girl, during the first Cylon War, her father, just before dying, charged her with caring for and protecting her younger sister.  When the little sister panics and freezes, the young Helena Cain is faced with the choice to stay and try to save her, or run and save herself.  She chooses to save herself, and when she returns after the cylons have gone, finds her sister taken (chillingly, probably to become the subject of gruesome medical experiments and vivisections that created cylon/human hybrids).  From this, we are clearly meant to infer that Helena Cain spent the rest of her life thereafter justifying to herself the fact that she abandoned her sister, and probably telling herself that it was actually the correct, even brave thing to do: do whatever it takes to survive, no matter the cost, and be willing to live with the consequences.  With such a philosophy, it's no wonder that an older Helena Cain finds it easy to justify committing atrocities and war crimes.Not only does this story manage, simultaneously, to flesh out (no pun intended) the cylons' history and their journey from the purely machine to the organic, and give an explanation of how Admiral Cain became the villain she ultimately proved to be, and finally wrap it up in such a way that explains why such a capable young officer as Kendra Shaw was never seen during the series itself.  It also does all this while being an excellent and gripping story that can stand alone on its merits as a well-told tale.

By any measure BSG is a class of its own as a Science fiction Television/Cable series. BSG Razor reaches a whole new level. The acting in Razor is truly top notch and the story is as always written.Razor is a reinvestigation of second seasons superb ""Pegasus"" episodes. Starting just before the Cylon attacks and develops as a ""Pegasus'"" parallel to the Galactica Mini Series and seasons one and two as told by Kendra Shaw (Stephanie Jacobsen) a young Bridge Officer. The story is told using a numerous flashbacks is while challenging it is rich with details and rewards.Razor using Shaw's flashback vehicle fills in many of the questions left in the wake of Season 2.5.We now know the reasons for Admiral Cain's Sadistic treatment of the ""Six"" Cylon.We are left in shock by the details murder the Pegasus' First Officer by Admiral Cain along with the unjustifiable abandonment and killings of helpless civilians by Pegasus' crew members.  A future detailed investigation of both off these incidents and inappropriate behavior by Pegasus' Officers and Crews is still required.The story line owes much to Apocalypses Now with Michelle Forbes continuing a ""knife edge""performance as Admiral Cain (Kurtz). She is truly outstanding! Stephanie Jacobsen in her role as Lt. Kendra Shaw like wise is excellent and transcends herself as an actor in her role as a Willard or Marlow.  Both dramatically overshadow the rest of the cast.  Razor is clearly their story. The emotional connections and undercurrents of their mentor vs.  awestruck Junior Officer relationship a joy to watch and an excellent character study.In the realm of minor complaints I point to the way Admirals Cain's ""Dinning In"" was handled. Very clumsy introduction of the Admirals relationship with Six. In what alternate universe is any Commanding Officer going to introduce an improper relationship with a subordinate at a dinning in with her command staff.

If they ever make a filler like this again, it should be all about Husker and whatever battlestar or ship he served on.  I'm sure, the original series fans would frakking love it.  Overall, it was good but I expected better.  I was hoping to see the Pegasus and Galactica fighting side by side or better yet fighting each other but to everyone's surprise it would have been only a military exercise or simulated.The Bad.  Kendra Shaw, no disrespect, but this role wasn't for her.  I'm sure she is fine actress, however dare I say it, it may have been better suited for someone who isn't cute as a button even when she's mad.  Also the scene when they are boarding the civilian ship, she looked like a child compared to the others.  She did not strike me as a leading figure at all.The Ugly.  Commander Cain, at least in the original series was a tactical genius.  This Admiral Cain didn't know whether she was coming or going.  First of all, a real military tactician would see the benefit of encountering a civilian fleet after loosing over 800 of her own crew to augment every profession onboard.  Secondly, transporting the essential personnel to the Pegasus's and then moving all the personnel from the ships that did not have FTL onto the ones that did have FTL wouldn't be tactical wizardry but just good common sense.  Thirdly, using the ships that did have FTL as bait or decoys would have been another tactic a true master mind wouldn't even need to think about.Now for the Fugly.  The one scene I really didn't like was where Husker and the centurion were free-falling.  The centurion does a nose dive from hundreds of feet in the air and still manages to be functional when Husker crash's through the roof.  Husker then beats it with a metal rod and ""that"" puts the centurion out of commission, not the fall.

To me the Battlestar Galactica concept has always made more sense intellectually because there are no fury animals or cute robots a la Star Wars or aliens that look like us and speak English a la Star Trek. The genius of BSG is that there are no aliens and the universe is essentially unimaginably vast and empty accept for those few scattered outposts occupied by humans.So on top of this realistic, believable and accessible foundation comes this brilliant, very cinematic full-length movie with pace, strong characters, great acting, jaw-dropping special effects and production values as good as I've ever seen on film.I'm glad they revisited the Pegasus saga to give it depth and rich texture. This movie stands on its own but of course it helps to be conversant with the BSG universe, including having some familiarity with the original series. Otherwise you may not realize that they are flashing back decades prior to a time of early generation Cylons who were vastly more mechanical than the newer generation humanoids who are indistinguishable from people. And Razor presents sort of the missing link, the intersection at which the Cylons begin to humanize some of their models and the barbaric nature of that transformation.This is maybe the best space-based science fiction film I've ever seen.

1098723,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,B000V5IP6K,Chris Fung,"[10, 11]","This discussion is based on the extended version in the DVD and not the broadcast version.WARNING: SPOILERS BELOWI just watched Battlestar Galactica: Razor (the movie-length extra that chronologically fits between Series 3 and Series 4 of one of the best TV dramas of recent memory) a couple of nights ago. Wow. This was certainly one of the most intense peices of TV I've ever watched in my life.The stellar performances of Michelle Forbes as Admiral Helena Cain and Stephanie Jacobsen as Major Kendra Shaw just have to be seen to be believed. Forbes brings charisma and a riveting coercion to her role while Jacobsen is utterly absorbing. One of the interesting aspects of both these characters is the way in which they are played so internally. You feel more than see a lot of the tensions that each woman experiences and this is a very hard act to pull off. The kind of micro-expressiveness you have to use in body language as well as facial expression only comes  from being able to mentally inhabit the world of the character you are creating.""Razor"" kind of works as a standalone episode but is much more effective if you have seen Seasons 2 AND 3. It is structured in a much more intelligent way than most TV episodes, and in some ways is more like ""Memento"" or ""Mulholland Drive"" in it's use of flashbacks and multiple points of view.Much has been made of the way in which the movie brings alive the back story to Admiral Cain, and the way in which the main protagonist, Major Shaw evolves through her relationship both actual and inspirational with Cain to become the Razor of the title: an instrument with neither feelings nor volition other than the will to carry out the mission.The obvious subtext to the whole Pegasus/Cain story arc is the notion of Military Necessity and what it means. Helena Cain believes so thoroughly in the pre-eminence of her goals that she will sacrifice anything and anyone in order to follow her purpose through to the end. She articulates layers of ""truth"" with one explanation for the crew, and one for her command staff and finally the need for revenge that blinds her to everything else in its path (her escalation of the raid on the ""relay station"", her execution of her only real friend among the crew, her deliberate handing over of her lover to the interrogator).Of course Cain's anger and venom towards Gina is amplified, not only by the notion that Gina was a Cylon agent, but that she (Cain) was also literally sleeping with the enemy: a double or triple betrayal given Cain's own personal history with the Cylons.In fact, betrayal and conflict in many different forms lurks throughout the whole episode. The actual gunfights with the Cylons are easy by comparison with everything else and this I think is another reason why BSG as a whole is such a rich literary milieu.It is of course, as the series from the very beginning has been, an extended exploration of the ethical and humanist consequences of the so-called war on terror and the military occupation of Iraq. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? (Who watches those who watch?) in the words of Juvenal. Invoking Military Necessity, Cain shoots her XO through the head on the bridge of her own ship. Invoking Military Necessity she has her crew cannibalize, massacre and abandon civilian ships and their passengers and crew. Invoking Military Necessity she grinds her officers down until they become what she imagines herself to be: efficient tools in the prosecution of military objectives.Kendra Shaw stands here for the modern junior career military officer (and by extension, the eyes of the viewer): intelligent, ambitious, a bit cynical, yet anxious to show her superiors she has what it takes. A product of wealth, she nonetheless believes in the military, and when her home is destroyed she makes the military her home and military people her emotional and professional center. Cain looms large on Kendra's horizon as the charismatic and successful mentor many of us have orbited hopefully in the beginning stages of our professional lives. Cain strives for achievement and uses a Prussian style of discipline to run her outfit. She lets her personal side show only in brief unguarded moments, and for the rest, she is all about the mission. But what are her default parameters? In the end, Cain has nothing to hold her in the world of human relations. She has duty, purpose and determination, but the center is filled with nothing but homicidal rage.Can there be a more stunning indictment in modern popular culture of the dangers of excessive commitment to ""the mission""? This dilemma lies at the heart of any military engaged in an occupation. Or indeed in anyone whose career significantly involves the prosecution of the interests of one's leaders. Modern military training has emphasized the notion that military personnel cannot indulge in the luxury of second-guessing the civilian leadership. ""If they say go, we go"". And while this is a good idea in theory, like all theoretical positions, it is capable of cynical manipulation especially by those in ultimate command.Cain did what she did because she believed it was the best way to achieve her goals and for the survival of her crew (as long as they did what she told them to). Too often, we confuse a concern for the mission with a concern for the soldiers who carry it out. If you show caring for people in order to carry out the mission, do you care about them or are you more concerned with being able to continue to succeed militarily? The same quandary flitted across the mind of Henry V on the eve of Agincourt, and must inevitably haunt the minds of any leader of conscience. What and who do you sacrifice in order to carry out your goals?In a way, Cain's decision to hand Gina over to the interrogators was the last act in her slide away from humanity. For not only was she encouraging torture (even of a ""thing""), she was aiding and abetting the destruction of her own desire for love and companionship. As Adama argues at the end of the episode, it was the notion that he would be accountable to his own people that kept Adama from going down the same path as Admiral Cain. This sense that we are part of something for which we have a moral responsibility is what separates tools from people whether they be human or machine, us or them, ""Americans"" or ""terrorists"". Without that sense, we become slaves to the mission and in the process, as RDM and the cast and crew of ""Razor"" show us so brilliantly, we lose what it is that makes us people in the first place.",5,All About the Mission,1210377600,"05 10, 2008",2008,6548,"['discussion', 'based', 'extended', 'version', 'DVD', 'not', 'broadcast', 'version.WARNING', 'SPOILERS', 'BELOWI', 'just',

First the good: It's great to see Starbuck and the Adamas back on TV, and their performances don't disappoint.  Also good is the decision to travel back to the initial Cylon attack-- so much has happened to ""humanize"" the Cylons since the pilot that I'd forgotten the way they were initially presented.  And the few revelations sprinkled around are very good, along with a surprisingly creepy moment.  I'm definately more excited for Season 4 after seeing this.The bad, for me, was largely in the execution.  Many have applauded the visual effects but I felt they were a step down from past seasons.  Everything seemed a touch too smooth and shiny, and that ""shaky cam"" I liked so much was less convincing here.  Perhaps the f/x budget was stretched too far.  Much more dire, however, is lame featured character Kendra Shaw.  Not that it's all her fault: Her character arc saddles the viewer with so much belabored, melodramatic moralizing, you'd think you were watching one of those awful ""Saint Helo"" episodes.  The most effective BSG for me lies in what characters don't have time to say, because they have to push on (see ""33""); slow-motion sad faces and silly razor allegories need not apply.  Above all, there's the feeling that all of the elements in this story have been handled before (and better) in seasons 1 and 2.At the end of the day, I'm delighted with the new ideas brought into the universe, and this is still much better and gutsier than most anything else on TV, even if it isn't the best BSG.

Razor was great! But, I don't know why anyone would purchase it separately, because it is included elsewhere. The one star on my review is for the horrible marketing, not for the show.While looking for the last piece of the series (see the end of the review), I came across some great deals (in terms of price), but was dismayed to see just how confusing things have become on Amazon. This review below is meant to help you wade through the mess in the marketplace, purchase the series, and enjoy it. I originally posted it for the combined Seasons 4.0 and 4.5 set, but someone kindly suggested I post it elsewhere as well. I hope you find it helpful.DVD CONFUSION-------------------------------------------------------The show is incredible. However, the whole DVD thing has been a disaster. They released it in the worst way possible (see below), Amazon compounded the problem by lumping together reviews for DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, and the DVD manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some products. I cannot imagine how someone who is not deeply familiar with it is supposed to purchase this wonderful show. Certainly, they would hesitate to give it as a gift! Let's hope this solves your problem.In one sentence, I can say that here is what you want to get: Seasons 1, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4.0, 4.5, and The Plan. I have links to them below. If you get these, then you will be sure to have it all.========================================-Season One was released as (Battlestar Galactica  - Season One) altogether with the pilot in one box.-Season Two was released asBattlestar Galactica - Season 2.0 (Episodes 1-10)andBattlestar Galactica: Season 2.5 (Episodes 11-20)in two boxes. You can now purchase them together asBattlestar Galactica (2004): Seasons 2.0 & 2.5-Season Three was released together in one box asBattlestar Galactica - Season Three.-Season Four was released asBattlestar Galactica - Season 4.0andBattlestar Galactica: Season 4.5with the Razor episode. Those are now available together asBattlestar Galactica (2004): Season 4.0 & 4.5. Occasionally I come across things like ""Battlestar Galactica: Season 4.5 - Limited Edition Gift Set (2009)."" It seems like a lot of money for one part of the full season, but you get some dog tags with it, so if you are into collecting memorabilia, you might want to consider it.-The Plan was released on its own asBattlestar Galactica: The Plan========================================OPTIONS FOR PURCHASING THEM ALL TOGETHER: BAD TO GOOD--------------------------------------------------------Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON). Not recommended. I do not own this, but according to the reviews, it is packaged poorly WITHOUT AN EPISODE LIST. That seems like a horrible idea for four seasons of a tv show. Apparently, it contains the same DVDs as the ones sold separately (explained above).-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (the one in the GRAY BOX). *Recommended*. I do not own this. Good reviews of it so far. Packaging problems were fixed. According to a comment from Leif Sheppard, it does include The Plan.-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON) [BLU-RAY] or the gray box [BLU-RAY] set. *Recommended*. I do not own this. Seems to include some extras, but not significant. It also has an episode list, according to the reviews. It might be worth buying if you wanted to get everything together.BOTTOM LINE:-------------------------------------------------------As far as I can tell from the reviews, I think there are two choices:(1) Buy either Blu-Ray set or the Gray DVD set.(2) Purchase everything separately (make sure to get all of the stuff mentioned above).NOTE:--------------------------------------------------------The ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes (episodes shown only online) have not been made available for purchase in any of the sets as far as I can tell. What a shame!-Also, if anyone sees any mistakes in this review, please tell me and I will edit it. Frustratingly, the manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some sets, so it is possible that my information has become outdated.",1,Don't Buy This!

1098727,A1DBQOB2CVLDOS,B000V5IP6K,"Chris Van Deelen ""Chris Van Deelen""","[1, 1]","Life is all about the choices we make. Our entire existence is governed by decision... Well, that and the need for food, shelter, and sex.But what it comes down to is this. We all make decisions every single day of our lives. Most of the time, the choices are minor. What colour shirt to wear, what to eat for breakfast, what show we're going to watch, music we're going to listen to.The vast majority of these choices and decisions we have to make have little to no impact on our lives.But, what if we had to make those life or death decisions? What if we were forced because of circumstance to choose between what's right and what's wrong? Would we be able to make these choices?Or, by finally choosing and following through, do we lose what it means to be human? Do we lose our humanity?Do we become something less?These were the choices and decisions forced upon Admiral Cain of the Battlestar Pegasus.In the future of those who survived the Cylon apocalypse, how will they judge Admiral Cain for her actions?Of course, this is all pure fiction. Battlestar Galactica will end at the end of season four, and there will be no future generations to look back upon the actions and choices of those few survivors who escaped the Cylon attack.In the original Battlestar Galactica series, there were several episodes that dealt with the Battlestar Pegasus joining up with the Galactica. I remember these episodes fondly, as it was really cool back then to see two Battlestars fighting against the Cylons.So, when the Pegasus was brought into the revamped series, I was ecstatic! And those episodes were a couple of the best of the series in my opinion. Extremely hard choices had to be made, and it led to Adama and Cain plotting to assassinate one another.For the good of the fleet and the survivors.When it was announced that Razor was coming out, again, I was excited. It's been several long months since I watched the finale of Season 3 of Battlestar Galactica, and it's going to be at least another month or more before the opener of season 4 is slated to air.So, having a BSG movie was great!Razor dealt with the events that led to the Battlestar Pegasus escaping total destruction with the rest of the Colonial fleet during the Cylon attack. Pure luck saved them, and I guess in a way, a sense of timing.It was two stories really in one. It showed how the Pegasus escaped destruction, and the events that took place - including the execution of Cain's original XO, the discovery of the Cylon infiltrator and saboteur, and the horrible events that were brought up in the original episodes.The second part of the movie showed Lee Adama being given the command of the Pegasus, the conflict between his new XO and Thrace, and a mission that brought closure to events that took place forty one years prior, that involved William Adama.The entire movie was about choices, those made and the sometimes terrible consequences involved.This movie is only for a fan of the series. Anyone who hasn't followed at least the first two seasons will be lost. Although the return of the `classic' Cylon and Cylon raider was a very pleasant surprise.And, I won't spoil it for anyone, but we learn some very disturbing things about one of the main characters.The effects were great, and we were treated to far more ship to ship battles in this movie than we've had in a long time.In the end, all it has done is whetted my appetite for season 4.Four out of five.",4,Bridging the gap,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,3445,"['Life', 'choices', 'make', 'entire', 'existence', 'governed', 'decision', 'Well', 'need', 'food', 'shelter', 'sex.But', 'what', 'down', 'make', 'decisions', 'single', 'day', 'lives', 'Most', 'time', 'choices', 'are', 'minor', 'What', 'colour', 'shirt', 'wear', 'what', 'eat', 'breakfast', 'what', 'show', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'music', ""'re"", 'going', 'listen', 'to.The', 'vast', 'majority', 'choices', 'decisions', 'have', 'make', 'have', 'little', 'impact', 'lives.But', 'what', 'had', 'make', 'life', 'death', 'decisions', 'What', 'were', 'forced', 'circumstance', 'choose', 'what', 'right', 'what', 'wrong', 'Would', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'choices', 'finally', 'choosing', 'following', 'do', 'lose', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'Do', 'lose', 'humanity', 'Do', 'become', 'something', 'less', 'were', 'choices', 'decisions', 'forced', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'Battlestar', 'Pegasus.In', 'future', 'who', 'survived', 'Cylon', 'apocalypse', 'how', 'will', 'judge', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'actions', 'course', 'pure', 'fiction', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'will', 'end', 'end', 'season', 'four', 'will', 'be', 'future', 'generations', 'look', 'back', 'actions', 'choices', 'few', 'survivors', 'who', 'escaped', 'Cylon', 'attack.In', 'original', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'series', 'were', 'several', 'episodes', 'dealt', 'Battlestar', 'Pegasus', 'joining', 'up', 'Galactica', 'remember', 'episodes', 'fondly', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'back', 'then', 'see', 'two', 'Battlestars', 'fighting', 'Cylons.So', 'when', 'Pegasus', 'was', 'brought', 'revamped', 'series', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'episodes', 'were', 'couple', 'best', 'series', 'opinion', 'Extremely', 'hard', 'choices', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'led', 'Adama', 'Cain', 'plotting', 'assassinate', 'one', 'good', 'fleet', 'survivors.When', 'was', 'announced', 'Razor', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'again', 'was', 'excited', 'been', 'several', 'long', 'months', 'watched', 'finale', 'Season', '3', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'going', 'be', 'least', 'month', 'more', 'opener', 'season', '4', 'slated', 'air.So', 'having', 'BSG', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'Razor', 'dealt', 'events', 'led', 'Battlestar', 'Pegasus', 'escaping', 'total', 'destruction', 'rest', 'Colonial', 'fleet', 'Cylon', 'attack', 'Pure', 'saved', 'guess', 'way', 'sense', 'timing.It', 'was', 'two', 'stories', 'really', 'one', 'showed', 'how', 'Pegasus', 'escaped', 'destruction', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'including', 'execution', 'Cain', 'original', 'XO', 'discovery', 'Cylon', 'infiltrator', 'saboteur', 'horrible', 'events', 'were', 'brought', 'up', 'original', 'episodes.The', 'second', 'part', 'movie', 'showed', 'Lee', 'Adama', 'being', 'given', 'command', 'Pegasus', 'conflict', 'new', 'XO', 'Thrace', 'mission', 'brought', 'closure', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'forty', 'one', 'years', 'prior', 'involved', 'William', 'Adama.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'choices', 'made', 'sometimes', 'terrible', 'consequences', 'involved.This', 'movie', 'only', 'fan', 'series', 'Anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'followed', 'least', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'return', 'classic', 'Cylon', 'Cylon', 'raider', 'was', 'very', 'pleasant', 'surprise.And', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anyone', 'learn', 'very', 'disturbing', 'things', 'one', 'main', 'characters.The', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'were', 'treated', 'far', 'more', 'ship', 'ship', 'battles', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'had', 'long', 'time.In', 'end', 'done', 'whetted', 'appetite', 'season', '4.Four', 'five']",N/A

1098734,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000V5IP6K,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Sigh. It's been a long time since a new episode of my two favorite sci-fi shows aired a new episode and still months more until ""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""Lost"" are back on television. Fortunately, I get to have my ""Battlestar Galactica"" fix again with the release of ""Battlestar Galactica Razor: Unrated Extended Edition"".I've been watching the remake of ""Battlestar Galactica"" since it first premiered on Sci-Fi channel and have been really engrossed in each episode's storyline. Very well-written (although I do question the direction of the latter of Season 3), one of the interesting storylines was the introduction of Admiral Cain (Michelle Forbes).At the end of Season 2, we watch as the crew of the Battlestar Galactica and the crew of Battlestar Pegasus come head to head. You wondered why Admiral Cain was hard edge and you were stuck in your seat wondering if the two battlestar's and their crew would go head to head and destroy each other.""Battlestar Galactica Razor"" provides the backstory of what took place on the Battlestar Pegasus after New Caprica was nuked by the Cylons. How Admiral Cain runs her ship and what happens if you are disloyal to her.She's totally opposite of Admiral Adama, thus the title ""razor"". She's hard edge, stone cold, she'll cut you like a knife and she's unstable.Under Cain, we are introduced to Officer Kendra Shaw (played by Stephanie Jacobsen - who is Portugese, Chinese and Norwegian btw...), as we watch as she joins the Pegasus and in the beginning is already taking hell from Admiral Cain for showing up late.But we get to see the transformation of Kendra Shaw. A proper and rule-abiding officer and then how being under Admiral Cain has turned her to a razor and also a junkie.""Battlestar Galactica Razor"" is jam-packed with drama, action and a well-written storyline as viewers get the back story of why Admiral Cain became what she is but definitely some interesting revelations that helps set things up for season 4 (the final season of ""Battlestar Galatica"").Although I missed the televised version of Razor, I can imagine that the unrated extended edition featured on DVD lies within the violence of the film. For example, in one scene, Admiral Cain's second in command gets shot point blank in the head and blood is splattered all over the command area. Something you don't see in the normal edition of the series.I also enjoyed how the film has three parts to it. More like three time lines.The first time line revolves around Kendra Shaw (played by Stephanie Jacobsen), as you watch her as she becomes an officer on the Pegasus under Admiral Cain and having to do things that may seem very morally wrong to viewers but in a way, as you think about it, Admiral Cain's decisions is what kept the crew of the Pegasus alive.This includes Shaw and security crew of the Pegasus shooting and killing innocent civilians who thought the Pegasus were there to save them and you also see what happens when you become disloyal to Cain.The second time line features Shaw under Apollo's command of the Pegasus (taking place after the death of Cain) and the third timeline revolves around Adama when he was much younger and a pilot during the first Cylon war.What's interesting is that we get to see the original Cylon (yes, the one from the ""Battlestar Galactica"" that aired nearly three decades ago. Adama discovers a warehouse where cylons are experimenting on humans and you get to learn about the hybrids that the Cylons are creating.All in all, I like the balance and how everything was tied together. I expected as much from the current Battlestar Galactica cast but I was really impressed with the work of the newbies on the show, specifically Stephanie Jacobsen.I've never seen Stephanie Jacobsen's work before and also among the first times I have seen an Asian woman sporting a thick English accent and Jacobsen's role as Kendra Shaw who has been transformed to somewhat of a razor is convincing and you learn how she became nearly like Admiral Cain but at the same time, what made her different from Cain and trying to make amends for the things that transpired while working under Cain.The other major cast members make their appearance in the film and I expected nothing less from those actors such as Olmos, Bamber, Sackhoff, McDonnel, Helfer, etc. Each of the Galactica originals did a great job but I was really impressed by Michelle Forbes and that she returned back in uniform to play Admiral Cain again.The character is so cold and unstable that to see how tyrannical she was as the head of Battlestar Pegasus was shocking but at the same time, you can see her reasoning and why her crew never really fought it. A different perspective from what we have been used to seeing on the television series.As for the DVD, the DVD is jam packed with a lot of bonus material. Deleted scenes, a featurette titled ""The Look of Battlestar Galactica"", a featurette titled ""My Favorite Episode So Far"" with the crew discussing their favorite episodes from the first three seasons, a sneak peak of season 4, a trailer of season 4, commentary on the unrated extended edition with executive producer Ronald D. Moore and Writer Michael Taylor, as well as webisodes featuring Oscar Adama when he fought in the first Cylon War.If you are a fan who has been watching the series and enjoying the storyline, you're going to dig ""Battlestar Galactica Razor"".Not only is it well-written and well-acted, but you get answers of why Admiral Cain is the way she is and what led to her downfall. But most of all is the surprise ending that leads into Season 4 regarding Starbuck. Wow!I think that people not familiar with the show, watching it for the first time will still enjoy the series but there's a lot of backstory (especially when they recap the series) of what has happened during seasons 2.0 and 2.5, that perhaps they may not enjoy it as much as one who is already enjoying the television series.But nevertheless, it's an awesome film that I really enjoyed and as for the DVD, it's jam packed with special features, you really can't go wrong.I will say that I highly recommend the ""Best Buy"" edition if you are planning to purchase the DVD.  I think it sucks that the DVD that is going on sale is missing this featurette because it's the only interview with Forbes and Jacobsen and if you don't buy the ""Best Buy"" version, you won't seem them in the special features on other releases from different stores.All in all, if you enjoy series (especially if you are collecting the series on DVD), you owe it to yourself to buy this

The movie takes place around midway through the TV series, with flashbacks to Admiral Cain's command of the Pegasus battlestar. So, watch at least the first two seasons of BSG before watching this movie.If you've seen the first two seasons of BSG, Razor is a great companion to the TV series. The movie follows Kendra Shaw, a staff officer on Cain's Pegasus who then joins Admiral Adama's fleet. Both the flashback and present time scenes follow Shaw's character. Fortunately, Shaw is a pretty compelling character in her own right. She's got a bit of an edge as a younger officer trying to work her way up. This is the first and only time we see her in BSG, but her character arc is much more interesting than many of the primary characters in the show (I won't say more for fear of spoilers).Also, Razor shows Admiral Cain's ruthless stewardship of the fleet and its repercussions. Characters make brutally hard decisions and suffer the consequences. However, what makes the movie work is that all of the characters, including Cain, are multifaceted characters. Viewers can understand, if not sympathize with, even the characters who commit war crimes.I enjoyed Razor far more than most episodes of BSG. In fact, in many ways Razor represents what the series could and should have been. By season three, BSG focused more on the pseudo-religious plot involving the Cylons, which I found utterly annoying. By contrast, Razor explores interesting philosophical issues and conveys an intense personal journey in the character of Kendra Shaw.",5,what BSG could have been,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,1653,"['First', 'all', 'NOT', 'standalone', 'movie', 'rather', 'movie', 'accompanies', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'series', 'movie', 'place', 'around', 'midway', 'TV', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'command', 'Pegasus', 'battlestar', 'So', 'watch', 'least', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'BSG', 'watching', 'movie.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'BSG', 'Razor', 'great', 'companion', 'TV', 'series', 'movie', 'Kendra', 'Shaw', 'staff', 'officer', 'Cain', 'Pegasus', 'who', 'then', 'Admiral', 'Adama', 'fleet', 'flashback', 'present', 'time', 'scenes', 'follow', 'Shaw', 'character', 'Fortunately', 'Shaw', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'character', 'own', 'right', 'got', 'bit', 'edge', 'younger', 'officer', 'trying', 'work', 'way', 'up', 'first', 'only', 'time', 'see', 'BSG', 'character', 'arc', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'many', 'primary', 'characters', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'fear', 'spoilers', '.Also', 'Razor', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'ruthless', 'stewardship', 'fleet', 'repercussions', 'Characters', 'make', 'brutally', 'hard', 'decisions', 'suffer', 'consequences', 'However', 'what', 'movie', 'work', 'characters', 'including', 'Cain', 'are', 'multifaceted', 'characters', 'Viewers', 'can', 'understand', 'not', 'sympathize', 'even', 'characters', 'who', 'commit', 'war', 'crimes.I', 'enjoyed', 'Razor', 'far', 'more', 'most', 'episodes', 'BSG', 'fact', 'many', 'ways', 'Razor', 'what', 'series', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'season', 'three', 'BSG', 'focused', 'more', 'pseudo-religious', 'plot', 'involving', 'Cylons', 'found', 'utterly', 'annoying', 'contrast', 'Razor', 'interesting', 'philosophical', 'issues', 'conveys', 'intense', 'personal', 'journey', 'character', 'Kendra', 'Shaw']",N/A

They did. Not only was this a very lackluster digression into back stories that we already knew, it seriously muddied the waters.Razor is supposed to be the story of the Pegasus.  It amplifies the stories of Admiral Cain, the Cylon (No 6) that had worked aboard the Pegasus, and Lee Adama's role as Captain of the Pegasus--all told from the perspective (more or less) of Cain's assistant Kendra Shaw. The story should have given us new insights, or at least answered some lingering questions.  It did neither.  There was no information that was presented in this story that we didn't already know from watching the series.  Going into details was not only unecessary, it some respects it actually took away from the dramatic impact of the series.  (Did we really have to know the specifics of the relationship between Cain and No 6? How was that important?)  Introducing an entirely new main character, Kendra Shaw, certainly did not help. We didn't know her well enough to identify with her, and, frankly, I found her a bit dull.But the worst aspect of this film was that it ran against what we already knew about characters we had come to love and respect.  The first rule of writing (one of the many first rules) is that you protect your characters.  You can kill them, but what you can't do is destroy their integrity, especially not for the sake of a plot contrivance.  Admiral Adama's integrity was seriously compromised at the end of Razor, and for no good reason. The story simply wasn't significant enough to warrant tarnishing the strongest character of the series.If you skip Razor, you will have missed nothing.  In fact, you might even enjoy the rest of the series more if you do.",2,A less than enthralling digression,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,1928,"['fan', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'series', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'Razor', 'part', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'intro', 'season', '4', 'part', 'series', 'stunning', 'figured', 'could', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'did', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'very', 'lackluster', 'digression', 'back', 'stories', 'already', 'knew', 'seriously', 'muddied', 'waters.Razor', 'supposed', 'be', 'story', 'Pegasus', 'stories', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'Cylon', 'No', '6', 'had', 'worked', 'Pegasus', 'Lee', 'Adama', 'role', 'Captain', 'Pegasus', 'told', 'perspective', 'more', 'less', 'Cain', 'assistant', 'Kendra', 'Shaw', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'new', 'insights', 'least', 'answered', 'lingering', 'questions', 'did', 'neither', 'was', 'information', 'was', 'presented', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'watching', 'series', 'Going', 'details', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'unecessary', 'respects', 'actually', 'took', 'away', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'series', 'Did', 'really', 'have', 'know', 'specifics', 'relationship', 'Cain', '6', 'How', 'was', 'important', 'Introducing', 'entirely', 'new', 'main', 'character', 'Kendra', 'Shaw', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'well', 'enough', 'identify', 'frankly', 'found', 'bit', 'worst', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'ran', 'what', 'already', 'knew', 'characters', 'had', 'come', 'love', 'respect', 'first', 'rule', 'writing', 'one', 'many', 'first', 'rules', 'protect', 'characters', 'can', 'kill', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'destroy', 'integrity', 'especially', 'not', 'sake', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'Admiral', 'Adama', 'integrity', 'was', 'seriously', 'compromised', 'end', 'Razor', 'good', 'reason', 'story', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'significant', 'enough', 'warrant', 'tarnishing', 'strongest', 'character', 'series.If', 'skip', 'Razor', 'will', 'have', 'missed', 'nothing', 'fact', 'might', 'even', 'enjoy', 'rest', 'series', 'more', 'do']",N/A

Almost all the ""dramatic moments"" were events we already knew about from the series and which didn't benefit at all from being shown to the audience.

We go behind-the-scenes of Cylon Agent number Six's relationship to the Admiral and the events that lead to her capture and torture.

Unfortunately towards the end of last season, it is generally accepted,  the show jumped the shark with 'unknown models' of Cylons and the fact the Cylons DON'T have a plan afterall. But BSG:Razor reminds fans of why we fell in love with this show from the start.Done in mainly flashbacks as newly promoted Commander Lee Adama takes over the Pegasus, we are shown the early days of the war when Admiral Cain saved the Pegasus from the Cylon attack that destroyed the colonies and went on the offensive.As the episode unrolls Adama's Pegasus encounters earlier styles of Cylon raiders which invokes flashbacks to one of his father's early adventures in the last Cylon war where he finds early attempts for the Cylons to go from toasters to human seeming cyborgs, and pressing forward towards a group of lost but elite Cylons. While still harking back to the days of Admiral Cain before she rejoined the fleet.Cain has become a bogey in BSG equal almost to #6 in bitchiness but this episode shows her in a differnet light. Yeah she's still nasty as all get out but she becomes far more realistic. One scene this shows Cain at her best, holding the battered crew together in a scene very similar to that at the end of the pilot episode where Adama rallies the spirits of his crew after fighting clear of the Cylons. It shows this tough commander as really cut from a cloth very similar to Bill Adama, and much more believable.As fans wait for the final season of BSG and desperately hope that it will bounce back in quality from last season's frak up, ""BSG:Razor"" is a wonderful reminder of that its creators also understand it.

Galactica, to me, has always excelled in it's ""on board the ship"" episodes. That being said, even the ""planet-side"" stories are superior to most of what else is on TV, but for it's own sake, I've found that some of them tend to slow down the momentum somewhat.

1098763,A39VKDG484JXXA,B000V5IP6K,H. E. Paul,"[13, 18]","I might have somewhat of a unique perspective on this DVD from some of the other reviewers. I have been watching the new series on DVD as my current TV package does not include SCI-FI and I am not willing to double my monthly cost for TV just to add that station. I also have not purchased or pirated the digital copies of Season 3, so at the time I watched this DVD I have only seen the mini-series, season 1 and season 2. I watched this ""movie"" a couple of months after finishing season 2.I loved the mini-series. I am a die-hard fan of the original show from the 70s and a friend of mine got me hooked on the new series be lending me his copy of the mini-series. To say that I have been blown away by the new series is nothing short of an understatement. I can't remember how long it has been since I have been so totally captivated by a television series, well, it has probably been since the original aired in 78.Taking into account the purchase price, the content of the DVD, and the special features this is really quite a mediocre offering compared to any of the previous DVD releases of this series. Most of the useful footage in the short webisodes is a part of the actual show itself, so their inclusion is just duplicating footage. There's a sneak peek and a trailer for Season 4 which are nice. The deleted scenes are also quite lacking on this release as compared to others.The story itself does not stand on its own. You are more likely to turn someone off to the show as a whole by using this DVD to introduce them to the series than to get them hooked on it. The story is centered around events from seasons 1 and 2 and even though I have seen both of them recently, I still found myself struggling to keep up with the story. The pivotal character is shallow, useless, and merely a placeholder for continuity, and she doesn't even perform that role very well. We are given graphic dipictations of events related about the history of the Pegasus prior to its meeting up with the Galactica. There is nothing much new or relevant here. Is it important to know how Pegasus discovered their cylon spy? No. Is it important to know of her relationship with Cain? No. It's all filler. This is supposed to be the better of the two story lines.The other main storyline is told as ""present day"", but it's not present day post season 3, it's present day mid season 2 after Lee Adama has been given command of the Pegasus. Other than the event called the ""surprise twist"", there is nothing even moderately interesting about this storyline. We are not given enough time to connect with any of the characters in any of the storylines to even gain a spark of empathy with their character save with Bill Adama. The flashbacks could have been handled in a much more linear fassion without having to jump between time periods every few minutes leaving the viewer dazed, confused, and reaching for their drammamine.The story line I found the most interesting is during the flashback to the first cylon war. Some of the events leading to the conclusion of the war are depicted, including the battle where the Columbia was lost. These are some really touching parts of the show, because the original cylon units from the original series make a comeback with their accompanying raider fighters. Even the show's original theme makes an appearance in the battle sequence. The most revealing information about the series to date comes from this continuity where the origins of the modern humanoid cylon units is introduced.My biggest beef with this show is the about-face depiction of some of the pivotal characters personalities. Bill Adama essentially defends Admiral Cain's egregious crimes against humanity by attempting to justify her decisions due to her not having characters of morality at her side to oppose her. Come on. To say that Adama's son and the Colonial President are the only people that made sure Bill Adama made moral decisions is a complete reversal of the character of Bill Adama that has been developed since the very first episode. The only errors I have seen Adama commit, and maybe this is more due to my lack of memory, is he has been restrained at times by counsel from his associates where he would have unnecessarily risked an excessive amount of resources for objects of little strategic importance. Cain was a war criminal. Period.

1098768,A3R56AWX8PRQLP,B000V5IP6K,Indy Reviewer,"[132, 151]","""Razor"" is a satisfying addition to Battlestar Galactica in what is more a couple extra episodes from Season 2 than a standalone movie.  1 star off for a slightly plodding second plot line and a half star off for an incomplete set of extras on the DVD leaves 3.5 stars, which I round up to 4 stars for both getting to see more of Michelle Forbes as Admiral Cain and one DVD-only scene that gives hints about Season 4.Razor combines past and present storylines of the Pegasus through focusing on a new character, Pegasus deck officer Kendra Shaw, and how her experiences in the past storyline transformed her into the unfeeling tool of the title that Cain believes is the ideal squared away leader.  The past storyline is the better of the two, with the backfill of what happened to the Pegasus until it met up with Galactica providing some riveting scenes.  While generally the best forty minutes of the show since Exodus II thanks to a couple of intriguing additions like the background of Gina and Cain, by only developing Fisk's drunken stories and largely neglecting character development outside of Shaw, the writers don't quite get this up to the superb quality of the rest of the Pegasus story arc.The present storyline is less compelling, set in between ""Captain's Hand"" and ""Lay Down Your Burdens"" as Apollo runs his first mission as commander of the Pegasus with some help from his father and Starbuck.  Once ""Razor"" begins focusing on this latter storyline in the second hour things begin to drag somewhat; on the commentary, Ron Moore explains that a good slug of the second plotline was his brainchild for the sake of continuity, and while probably easier to follow than the original script it feels somewhat like the padding it is.Despite that, Razor is still fun stuff.  The season 2 version of Starbuck is a lot more enjoyable to watch, and the interactions between Apollo, Shaw and her make one hope that the writers remember her importance for the final season. Another plus is Michelle Forbes' superb performance, which makes you wish they could somehow bring Cain back.  This also has the best special effects of the entire series; having seen them in a theater as well as the DVD, they're just eyepopping.  FX wiz Gary Hutzel got a real budget for once and Ron Moore admits that some of his CGI work actually drove parts of the plot rather than the reverse.  Considering Moore once said the original Pegasus sets were limited to a corridor, a multi-purpose utility room, the CIC, and Cain's quarters, props to him and his effects guys for figuring out how to make things work around mostly those locations.  The DVD is worth buying on this alone.The majority of the new material is visually stunning but doesn't add much.  The ""favorite episode"" feature reveals ""33"" as the choice of the wise, another brief feature reveals a bit about the production, Adama and Cain have ""formulative experiences"" during the first Cylon war (the former having already been shown in the webisodes), Shaw and Apollo have their own pre-war sequence, and Baltar and his dream Six make a brief appearance.  None of this adds much to the characters or plot, and weirdly Moore and Taylor refer to some additional footage that didn't make it even into the deleted scenes category during a commentary that is good but essentially similar to the average podcast.  Slightly disappointing.However, what's truly compelling in the new material are the additional Cylon prophecies given to the hybrid, which both flesh that character out as more than ""babbling"" and provide some tantalizing insights into Season 4 well beyond the spoiler at the end of the movie.  Taylor admits its inclusion may be a creation of the home video department, but it's the one must-watch bit of new material that makes the DVD worthwhile on its own.  4 stars.",4,"Decent plot, gorgeous FX, and an intriguing insight into Season 4",1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,3829,"['Razor', 'satisfying', 'addition', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'what', 'more', 'couple', 'extra', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'standalone', 'movie', '1', 'star', 'slightly', 'plodding', 'second', 'plot', 'line', 'half', 'star', 'off', 'incomplete', 'set', 'extras', 'DVD', '3.5', 'stars', 'round', 'up', '4', 'stars', 'getting', 'see', 'more', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'one', 'DVD-only', 'scene', 'hints', 'Season', '4.Razor', 'combines', 'past', 'present', 'storylines', 'Pegasus', 'focusing', 'new', 'character', 'Pegasus', 'officer', 'Kendra', 'Shaw', 'how', 'experiences', 'past', 'storyline', 'transformed', 'unfeeling', 'tool', 'title', 'Cain', 'ideal', 'squared', 'away', 'leader', 'past', 'storyline', 'better', 'two', 'backfill', 'what', 'happened', 'Pegasus', 'met', 'up', 'Galactica', 'providing', 'riveting', 'scenes', 'generally', 'best', 'forty', 'minutes', 'show', 'Exodus', 'II', 'thanks', 'couple', 'intriguing', 'additions', 'background', 'Gina', 'Cain', 'only', 'developing', 'Fisk', 'drunken', 'stories', 'largely', 'neglecting', 'character', 'development', 'Shaw', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'up', 'superb', 'quality', 'rest', 'Pegasus', 'story', 'arc.The', 'present', 'storyline', 'less', 'compelling', 'set', 'Captain', 'Hand', 'Lay', 'Down', 'Burdens', 'Apollo', 'first', 'mission', 'commander', 'Pegasus', 'help', 'father', 'Starbuck', 'Razor', 'focusing', 'latter', 'storyline', 'second', 'hour', 'things', 'begin', 'drag', 'somewhat', 'commentary', 'Ron', 'Moore', 'good', 'slug', 'second', 'plotline', 'was', 'brainchild', 'sake', 'continuity', 'probably', 'easier', 'follow', 'original', 'script', 'somewhat', 'padding', 'is.Despite', 'Razor', 'still', 'fun', 'stuff', 'season', '2', 'version', 'Starbuck', 'lot', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'interactions', 'Apollo', 'Shaw', 'make', 'one', 'hope', 'writers', 'remember', 'importance', 'final', 'season', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'superb', 'performance', 'wish', 'could', 'somehow', 'bring', 'Cain', 'back', 'also', 'best', 'special', 'effects', 'entire', 'series', 'having', 'seen', 'theater', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'just', 'eyepopping', 'FX', 'wiz', 'Gary', 'Hutzel', 'got', 'real', 'budget', 'once', 'Ron', 'Moore', 'CGI', 'work', 'actually', 'drove', 'parts', 'plot', 'rather', 'reverse', 'Considering', 'Moore', 'once', 'said', 'original', 'Pegasus', 'sets', 'were', 'limited', 'corridor', 'multi-purpose', 'utility', 'room', 'CIC', 'Cain', 'quarters', 'props', 'effects', 'guys', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'around', 'mostly', 'locations', 'DVD', 'worth', 'buying', 'alone.The', 'majority', 'new', 'material', 'visually', 'stunning', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'favorite', 'episode', 'feature', '33', 'choice', 'wise', 'brief', 'feature', 'bit', 'production', 'Adama', 'Cain', 'have', 'formulative', 'experiences', 'first', 'Cylon', 'war', 'former', 'having', 'already', 'been', 'shown', 'webisodes', 'Shaw', 'Apollo', 'have', 'own', 'pre-war', 'sequence', 'Baltar', 'dream', 'Six', 'make', 'brief', 'appearance', 'None', 'much', 'characters', 'plot', 'weirdly', 'Moore', 'Taylor', 'refer', 'additional', 'footage', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'even', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'category', 'commentary', 'good', 'essentially', 'similar', 'average', 'podcast', 'Slightly', 'disappointing.However', 'what', 'truly', 'compelling', 'new', 'material', 'are', 'additional', 'Cylon', 'prophecies', 'given', 'hybrid', 'flesh', 'character', 'out', 'more', 'babbling', 'provide', 'tantalizing', 'insights', 'Season', '4', 'well', 'spoiler', 'end', 'movie', 'Taylor', 'inclusion', 'may', 'be', 'creation', 'home', 'video', 'department', 'one', 'must-watch', 'bit', 'new', 'material', 'DVD', 'worthwhile', 'own', '4', 'stars']",N/A

Sidhu ""Cylon God.""","[0, 0]","Plot:A two-hour Battlestar Galactica special that tells the story of the Battlestar Pegasus several months prior to it finding the Galactica.My Review:With the recent news the possibly one of the most brilliant Science Fiction shows coming to its conclusion, producer Ronald D. Moore felt he owed Battlestar fans to a 2 hour short of a commemoration to the show in between Seasons 3 and 4, and with it he gives us the Battlestar Pegasus' history.One can only construe that with the show ending on Moore's terms he does have the resources and realistic approach to make his ideas work. Albeit there will be no sixth or seventh season, he gives us a episodic filler that shows us the short spent life of a Pegasus office named Kendra Shaw (Stephanie Chaves-Jacobsen). Our focus encompasses her trial and tribulations associated with a unknown character. She passes the role of being likable in all aspects, even her darkest hours ascertain her character flaws but her hard-headed impiety and realist approach to a situation, even if it crosses a line.For some it may be an uninteresting stop gap to fill in the void of the shows extended break, however it does remarkably well in providing some amazing visual treats. It gives us a crews account of tragic events as well as some character history, new and old faces reprise themselves with the same faade.Whilst the story unfolds, we see flashbacks of Kendra's time on Pegasus during the chronological Season 2 episodes which the film is set and suggests that it took place during that time, while it flashbacks to her time under the command of Admiral Cain (Michelle Forbes); whom proves that she can smile. The contrasting hard decisions she makes and if or not to follow her Admiral. We are also treated to a flashback of Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) of which gets the shock treatment with a younger actor who portrays him right down to the voice and mannerisms. A revelation ensues the flashback, in which we are given a rather disturbing insight into 'those skin-jobs'.We are given a trip down in the melancholy road, visually; as we get to see the classic Cylon and Cylon raiders that were ever-present in the 70's version, that fit the modern re-imagining as they were constantly mentioned throughout the series as have being been in first war 40 years prior to the current Cylon war. They are given a reboot with the same familiar charisma, even for a machine as old catch phrases make a reprisal.Some may suggest and argue that it was never logical idea to make this 2 hour special; as it really only keeps the fans on edge before the fourth and final Season returns. Nevertheless, us fan boys, and girls, need something to take the heat off.Verdict:Filler; but a very good one, emotionally and visually enthralling as it keeps in tune with the series and keeps it fresh and fun. 8.5/10.",4,Enigmatic Entertainment.,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2850,"['Plot', 'two-hour', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'special', 'story', 'Battlestar', 'Pegasus', 'several', 'months', 'prior', 'finding', 'Galactica.My', 'Review', 'recent', 'news', 'possibly', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'coming', 'conclusion', 'producer', 'Ronald', 'D.', 'Moore', 'felt', 'owed', 'Battlestar', 'fans', '2', 'hour', 'short', 'commemoration', 'show', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'Battlestar', 'Pegasus', 'history.One', 'can', 'only', 'construe', 'show', 'ending', 'Moore', 'terms', 'have', 'resources', 'realistic', 'approach', 'make', 'ideas', 'work', 'Albeit', 'will', 'be', 'sixth', 'seventh', 'season', 'episodic', 'filler', 'short', 'spent', 'life', 'Pegasus', 'office', 'named', 'Kendra', 'Shaw', 'Stephanie', 'Chaves-Jacobsen', 'focus', 'trial', 'tribulations', 'associated', 'unknown', 'character', 'role', 'being', 'likable', 'aspects', 'even', 'darkest', 'hours', 'ascertain', 'character', 'flaws', 'hard-headed', 'impiety', 'realist', 'approach', 'situation', 'even', 'line.For', 'may', 'be', 'uninteresting', 'stop', 'gap', 'fill', 'void', 'shows', 'extended', 'break', 'however', 'remarkably', 'well', 'providing', 'amazing', 'visual', 'treats', 'crews', 'account', 'tragic', 'events', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'history', 'new', 'old', 'reprise', 'same', 'story', 'unfolds', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'Kendra', 'time', 'Pegasus', 'chronological', 'Season', '2', 'episodes', 'film', 'set', 'took', 'place', 'time', 'time', 'command', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'whom', 'can', 'smile', 'contrasting', 'hard', 'decisions', 'not', 'follow', 'Admiral', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'flashback', 'Admiral', 'Adama', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'shock', 'treatment', 'younger', 'actor', 'who', 'right', 'down', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'revelation', 'flashback', 'are', 'given', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'insight', ""'those"", ""skin-jobs'.We"", 'are', 'given', 'trip', 'down', 'melancholy', 'road', 'visually', 'get', 'see', 'classic', 'Cylon', 'Cylon', 'raiders', 'were', 'ever-present', '70', 'version', 'fit', 'modern', 're-imagining', 'were', 'constantly', 'mentioned', 'series', 'have', 'being', 'been', 'first', 'war', '40', 'years', 'prior', 'current', 'Cylon', 'war', 'are', 'given', 'reboot', 'same', 'familiar', 'charisma', 'even', 'machine', 'old', 'catch', 'phrases', 'make', 'reprisal.Some', 'may', 'suggest', 'argue', 'was', 'never', 'logical', 'idea', 'make', '2', 'hour', 'special', 'really', 'only', 'fans', 'edge', 'fourth', 'final', 'Season', 'returns', 'Nevertheless', 'fan', 'boys', 'girls', 'need', 'something', 'take', 'heat', 'off.Verdict', 'Filler', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'emotionally', 'visually', 'enthralling', 'tune', 'series', 'fresh', 'fun', '8.5/10']",N/A

I thought it was decent, not great, and most of the sci fi & Battlestar fans I know seem to feel the same.I'll focus on some of the worse aspects only because there's so many raves here.The acting of Kendra--the main character is flat.  I'm talking Anakin Skywalker/Padme Amidala flat.  Just like Star Wars Ep 1-3, that flat acting mars the movie which is incredible in so many other aspects.The story is good, but the flat acting dulls the delivery of the punch.  It also made what should've been heart stopping moments into something I didn't really care for.  Its kind of a shame because some of the scenes in this movie are very well written if you think about the movie purely in terms of a script.  It had some of the same exact goings on that the fans wanted to see that were mentioned in the Pegasus episodes.It also didn't have the benefit of being part of the long story arcs that make Battlestar a much deeper show than 1 episode (or in this case movie) could present.  It does contribute to the larger Battlestar plotlines, but its a side contribution.  It doesn't have any of those shocking discoveries you see in the show that took seasons to build up.What makes this movie worth watching is that it adds to the Pegasus story arc, adds backstory to Adama, has some incredible shots of the Colonial fleet before it was destroyed & aside from the main character, the acting on the part of the other actors is very well done.

The special effects are stunning, perhaps better than anything you even see in film these days; and as always the acting is top-notch. But the dark tone of the series is dimmed even further in this film which centers upon a former officer in Helena Cain's staff aboard the Battlestar Pegasus taking on a new mission for the Pegasus's new commander (as of the end of season 2), Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber). Most of the episode is taken up with flashbacks, and most of these are to wartime atrocities committed by Cain mentioned in Seasons 1 and 2 and those of her Cylon nemeses: to say that that doesn't mean much fun for the viewer is putting it mildly. Since there's very little emphasis on the more hopeful characters (like Laura Roslin) or the more amusing characters (like Gaius Baltar), the whole thing gets very mired down in its own grimness, and though Michelle Forbes, as Admiral Cain, is a fine actress here, she does not (as they say) bring much to a party. Even in the more contemporary sequences of the movie, involving an attempt to bomb a Cylon station devoted to creating a new human-Cylon hybrid, get bogged down, especially when the hybrid starts spouting prophetic apothegms that are almost impossible to make out because of his raspy voice (I had to go back and use the closed-captioning).

1098780,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B000V5IP6K,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[3, 4]","""Battlestar Galactica: Razor"" reminded me a little of those old Marvel Comics ""Annuals"" that were popular in the 70's, 80's, and 90's: you'd get a special, extra-long, stand-alone comic book featuring the Hulk, Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, etc. and the stories were sometimes good and sometimes not so good, but usually had little impact on the ongoing continuity of those characters' regular monthly titles.Why do I say this?  Well, ""Razor"" is an entertaining, extra, stand-alone episode that, in fairness, does offer a FEW plot tidbits that will resonate in season 4 of BSG, but for the most part still feels like an unneeded though diverting ""filler"" episode, like so many of those Marvel Annuals.Another small critical observation: There's a kind of haphazard, patchwork quality to ""BSG: Razor"" that prevents total immersion in the experience.  It feels like they already had 30 or 40 percent of these scenes left over from the season 2 ""Pegasus"" storyline (don't know if they did or not), and just decided to film new connective scenes to place between them, and while they were at it, toss in a few additional brief storylines: glimpses of the first Cylon War, a new rescue mission for Lee Adama's Pegasus, etc.The result is entertaining, but all over the map: a character on Lee Adama's Pegasus flashes back to the time when Admiral Cain was in charge of the Pegasus, where we then see Admiral Cain (in a flashback within a flashback) flash back to both the first Cylon War (when she was a child) and then to the Cylon attack on the Pegasus just months before.  And all that is mixed in with a new, previously unseen adventure (along with previously unseen characters) while Lee was in charge of the Pegasus, which is itself ultimately a flashback, as the Pegasus was destroyed many episodes ago.  And, oh yes, don't forget Commander Adama's flashbacks to the first Cylon War... we have to stir those into the mix, too.  Whew, it's enough to make your head spin.But while the structure is patchwork and kind of crazy, individual scenes are very good, and several revelations (about past events and things we'll be dealing with in season 4) are quite interesting.  Also, the action set pieces and special effects are very ambitious and all top notch, even by BSG's excellent standards.But, alas, in the end, ""Battlestar Galactica: Razor"" is indeed like one of those old Marvel Annuals: a longer, bonus story that isn't necessary to experience in order to keep up with the regular series' continuity.  But- and this is a big ""but""- it's definitely like one of the better Marvel Annuals, the ones that would deliver some genuine ""wow"" moments and maybe even come up with a character or situation that might actually warrant at least SOME further exploration in the monthly Marvel title in question.  So, yeah, quibbles aside, I'd say get this thing.  Heck, I'll even give this four stars, even though I wish three-and-a-half stars was an option.Oh, yes- the DVD's extra features aren't lavish but are quite interesting, especially for hardcore fans of the show.",4,"Maybe not a ""must see"" but definitely intriguing to see",1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,3064,"['Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Razor', 'reminded', 'little', 'old', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'Annuals', 'were', 'popular', '70', '80', '90', ""'d"", 'get', 'special', 'extra-long', 'stand-alone', 'comic', 'book', 'featuring', 'Hulk', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Spider-Man', 'etc', 'stories', 'were', 'sometimes', 'good', 'sometimes', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'usually', 'had', 'little', 'impact', 'ongoing', 'continuity', 'characters', 'regular', 'monthly', 'titles.Why', 'do', 'say', 'Well', 'Razor', 'entertaining', 'extra', 'stand-alone', 'episode', 'fairness', 'offer', 'FEW', 'plot', 'tidbits', 'will', 'resonate', 'season', '4', 'BSG', 'most', 'part', 'still', 'unneeded', 'diverting', 'filler', 'episode', 'so', 'many', 'Marvel', 'Annuals.Another', 'small', 'critical', 'observation', 'kind', 'haphazard', 'patchwork', 'quality', 'BSG', 'Razor', 'total', 'immersion', 'experience', 'already', 'had', '30', '40', 'percent', 'scenes', 'left', 'over', 'season', '2', 'Pegasus', 'storyline', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'decided', 'film', 'new', 'connective', 'scenes', 'place', 'were', 'few', 'additional', 'brief', 'storylines', 'glimpses', 'first', 'Cylon', 'War', 'new', 'rescue', 'mission', 'Lee', 'Adama', 'Pegasus', 'etc.The', 'result', 'entertaining', 'map', 'character', 'Lee', 'Adama', 'Pegasus', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'was', 'charge', 'Pegasus', 'where', 'then', 'see', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'flashback', 'flashback', 'flash', 'back', 'first', 'Cylon', 'War', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'then', 'Cylon', 'attack', 'Pegasus', 'just', 'months', 'mixed', 'new', 'previously', 'unseen', 'adventure', 'previously', 'unseen', 'characters', 'Lee', 'was', 'charge', 'Pegasus', 'ultimately', 'flashback', 'Pegasus', 'was', 'destroyed', 'many', 'episodes', 'ago', 'oh', 'yes', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Commander', 'Adama', 'flashbacks', 'first', 'Cylon', 'War', 'have', 'stir', 'mix', 'too', 'Whew', 'enough', 'make', 'head', 'spin.But', 'structure', 'patchwork', 'kind', 'crazy', 'individual', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'several', 'revelations', 'past', 'events', 'things', ""'ll"", 'be', 'dealing', 'season', '4', 'are', 'quite', 'interesting', 'Also', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'ambitious', 'top', 'notch', 'even', 'BSG', 'excellent', 'standards.But', 'alas', 'end', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Razor', 'indeed', 'one', 'old', 'Marvel', 'Annuals', 'longer', 'bonus', 'story', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'experience', 'order', 'keep', 'up', 'regular', 'series', 'continuity', 'But-', 'big', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'Marvel', 'Annuals', 'ones', 'would', 'deliver', 'genuine', 'wow', 'moments', 'maybe', 'even', 'come', 'up', 'character', 'situation', 'might', 'actually', 'warrant', 'least', 'SOME', 'further', 'exploration', 'monthly', 'Marvel', 'title', 'question', 'So', 'yeah', 'quibbles', 'aside', ""'d"", 'say', 'get', 'thing', 'Heck', ""'ll"", 'even', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'even', 'wish', 'three-and-a-half', 'stars', 'was', 'option.Oh', 'yes-', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'lavish', 'are', 'quite', 'interesting', 'especially', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'show']",N/A

I didn't feel such a need because IMO the two-parter from season 2 was both satisfying story-wise and an interesting drama in its own right.Nevertheless, they made Razor, which IMO is one of the best 1.5 hours of BSG to date. The story is poignant and Acting is spot on, both from the Galactica's crew but most importantly from the newcomers. Centering the story around previously unseen character of Kendra Shaw (Stephanie Jacobsen) might seem risky at first but the result was great.From a pure dramatic standpoint it's probably the best BSG has ever been. And the way they showed this tragic backstory (no happy ending for this one, sorry folks!) with some heavy character development (although not perfect) deserves a praise (as if they needed more praise... LOL).I hated the character of Adm. Cain (Michelle Forbes) and how she treated people. Thought she was too tough in season 2 but still could understand her reasoning. In Razor she is mad and ruthless (I must admit I haven't looked at the extended cut yet, leaving that one for laters with the commentary on, of course... and hearing that they sugarcoated the character a bit in added scenes... who knows...).However, it's good they didn't push her that far in ""Pegasus"", which would rightfully (IMO) deny Adama an honest dilemma what to do with her other than terminate on the spot.This episode in a way reminds me of an episode of Voyager where they showed an evil counterpart of the crew, with evil Janeway at the helm... but that one had a noticeable comedic touch (regardless if on purpose or not), and it was obvious those characters were caricatures. Here, Cain, Shaw, and some other characters are very serious indeed.

1098791,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000V5IP6K,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[0, 0]","Razor is an interesting item. In essence there was a long gap between Battlestar Galactica season 3 and season 4. The people in charge of Battlestar Galactica literally said ""let us make some sort of instant-to-DVD movie we can get the fans to buy. Hey, you writers, what can you write for us to sell?"" The writers tossed around the idea and realized that we had seen little of the Pegasus battlestar. That ship shows up in the series and then is demolished. The writers thought it would be perfect to tell more about the Pegasus and also to bring back Admiral Cain who was played incredibly well by Michelle Forbes. So this was a perfect way to get more Admiral Cain time, to get some back story fleshed out and to give Battlestar Galactica fans a fix while they eagerly awaited Season 4 to begin.On one hand it's easy to be cynical about a company saying ""how can we create more things for fans to buy."" On the other hand, if right now Peter Jackson said ""let me make a 2 hour movie in the Lord of the Rings universe for fans to buy"" I honestly wouldn't care WHAT aspect of Middle Earth he chose to cover. If he was bringing in my favorite actors, in my favorite world, to tell ANY story I would buy it and watch it repeatedly. So in the same sense if Razor brings us more acting time and storyline in Battlestar Galactica's world that can be seen pretty much as a good thing.Interestingly, the story is really all about Kendra Shaw - played well by Australian Stephanie Jacobsen. Kendra is one of the ONLY characters on this show to speak with a ""non-American accent"" and it helps her to stand out. Kendra is a fresh officer coming on to help Cain when the Pegasus is initially attacked. The rest of the story is really all from Kendra's point of view - how Cain handles the issues that come up, how Kendra changes over time based on what she goes through. Certainly she runs into Apollo and Starbuck and others, but she is always the focus.A lot of what went on in Season 3 is now explained with Razor, i.e. you understand characters' motivations. That being said, I think they try a little TOO hard to ""justify"" decisions that people made which simply were not the right ones. They do show that certain characters had mixed feelings about what they did, but it would have been nice if they went into that more rather than just hinting at ""oh person X had a tummy ache sometimes when they thought about having wreaked genocide down onto an entire planet"". I've of course changed the situation for spoiler reasons :)There are certain key issues I have with this episode but that would get into spoiler area, so I'll keep those all separate in my longer review. I know Amazon is very sensitive about spoilers anywhere in their site area.It is definitely important to see the ""long and short"" version on this DVD as well as the commentary track. If you've only seen the broadcast short version you've missed out on a lot of the story. Even watching the long version still leaves some areas murky - areas that start to make sense when you hear the commentary track.Definitely a must-watch before season 4 comes around since it informs what they are going to do in season 4.",4,Great to see more of Cain,1225324800,"10 30, 2008",2008,3173,"['Razor', 'interesting', 'item', 'essence', 'was', 'long', 'gap', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'season', '3', 'season', '4', 'people', 'charge', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'literally', 'said', 'let', 'make', 'sort', 'instant-to-DVD', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'fans', 'buy', 'Hey', 'writers', 'what', 'can', 'write', 'sell', 'writers', 'tossed', 'idea', 'realized', 'had', 'seen', 'little', 'Pegasus', 'battlestar', 'ship', 'up', 'series', 'then', 'demolished', 'writers', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'tell', 'more', 'Pegasus', 'also', 'bring', 'back', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'incredibly', 'well', 'Michelle', 'Forbes', 'So', 'was', 'perfect', 'way', 'get', 'more', 'Admiral', 'Cain', 'time', 'get', 'back', 'story', 'fleshed', 'out', 'give', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'fix', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'Season', '4', 'begin.On', 'one', 'hand', 'easy', 'be', 'cynical', 'company', 'saying', 'how', 'can', 'create', 'more', 'things', 'fans', 'buy', 'other', 'hand', 'right', 'now', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'said', 'let', 'make', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'universe', 'fans', 'buy', 'honestly', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'WHAT', 'aspect', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'chose', 'cover', 'was', 'bringing', 'favorite', 'actors', 'favorite', 'world', 'tell', 'ANY', 'story', 'would', 'buy', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'So', 'same', 'sense', 'Razor', 'more', 'acting', 'time', 'storyline', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'pretty', 'much', 'good', 'thing.Interestingly', 'story', 'really', 'Kendra', 'Shaw', 'played', 'well', 'Australian', 'Stephanie', 'Jacobsen', 'Kendra', 'one', 'ONLY', 'characters', 'show', 'speak', 'non-American', 'accent', 'stand', 'out', 'Kendra', 'fresh', 'officer', 'coming', 'help', 'Cain', 'when', 'Pegasus', 'initially', 'attacked', 'rest', 'story', 'really', 'Kendra', 'point', 'view', 'how', 'Cain', 'issues', 'come', 'up', 'how', 'Kendra', 'time', 'based', 'what', 'Certainly', 'Apollo', 'Starbuck', 'others', 'always', 'focus.A', 'lot', 'what', 'went', 'Season', '3', 'now', 'explained', 'Razor', 'i.e', 'understand', 'characters', 'motivations', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'try', 'little', 'TOO', 'hard', 'justify', 'decisions', 'people', 'made', 'simply', 'were', 'not', 'right', 'ones', 'do', 'show', 'certain', 'characters', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'what', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'went', 'more', 'rather', 'just', 'hinting', 'oh', 'person', 'X', 'had', 'tummy', 'ache', 'sometimes', 'when', 'thought', 'having', 'wreaked', 'genocide', 'down', 'entire', 'planet', ""'ve"", 'course', 'changed', 'situation', 'spoiler', 'reasons', 'are', 'certain', 'key', 'issues', 'have', 'episode', 'would', 'get', 'spoiler', 'area', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'separate', 'longer', 'review', 'know', 'Amazon', 'very', 'sensitive', 'spoilers', 'anywhere', 'site', 'area.It', 'definitely', 'important', 'see', 'long', 'short', 'version', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'commentary', 'track', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'broadcast', 'short', 'version', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'out', 'lot', 'story', 'Even', 'watching', 'long', 'version', 'still', 'areas', 'murky', 'areas', 'start', 'make', 'sense', 'when', 'hear', 'commentary', 'track.Definitely', 'must-watch', 'season', '4', 'around', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'season', '4']",N/A

It's been a long time since the Season 3 cliffhanger left us all with our jaws on the floor, and even though the new season won't begin until March 2008, ""Razor"" gives us a lot to look forward to.This extended episode/movie is not a continuation of the last season. Instead, it offers a glimpse of events that occurred off-camera several seasons ago, back when Admiral Helena Cain (Michelle Forbes) was in charge of the Pegasus following the initial cylon attack, and also when Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) took over as commander of the ship many months later. There are two stories that interweave simultaneously and focus on Cain's motivations, as well as her interactions with young officer Kendra Shaw (Stephanie Jacobsen), who eventually becomes Lee's XO. Although Cain has generally been perceived by viewers as a ruthless you-know-what, ""Razor"" forces us to put ourselves in her shoes and think about how we would have acted if we'd been placed in similar situations.There are some great moments in this movie, including an interesting revelation about Cain's personal life, a shocking appearance by the original cylons (I'm talking about the ones from the crappy 1970's series), and a cryptic message regarding Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff) that never gets passed along, which can be interpreted in a variety of ways and is guaranteed to leave fans clamoring for Season 4 to begin.""Razor"" is yet another great chapter in the BSG saga.

Probably the biggest reason is the emphasis on female characters.  Probably no other sci-fi or fantasy franchise (TV or big-screen) places such large emphasis on its female characters.  This made-for-DVD movie offshoot from the TV series exemplifies this emphasis on the female characters with more gusto than probably any of the regular episodes.  This movie is actually a series of flashbacks interspersed within the present time frame; the latter being the period right after Admiral Cain is shot, and right before Baltar's election to the presidency.  The show follows four female leads; Admiral Cain of the Battlestar Pegasus, one of her officers, Kendra Shaw, Starbuck, and the Model Six cylon that operated on Pegasus.  There are also cameo appearances by Boomer and President Roslin, two other key female characters from the TV series.  Between the six of them, we have a whole gamut of emotions, roles, and relations.  First is the romance and then bitter fallout between Model Six and Admiral Cain.  This runs in parallel with Cain's condenscension towards Kendra.  This is followed up by the personal hatred and professional rivalry of Kendra Shaw and Starbuck.  In the background is Roslin's distrust of Admiral Cain.  In fact, the only male character with any role in the movie is Adama's flashback to the last days of the first Ceylon war.

If you are expecting another Battlestar Galactica (2003 Miniseries), Razor has all the action but is not the groundbreaking three hours long that that film was, running in at 101 minutes,  but is still cutting edge television none-the-less. Razor is not yet available as part of Battlestar Galactica seasons, so the only way to get it is as a standalone DVD.Battlestar Galactica  is barely recognizable from the 1970s original series. Such is the scope of the makeover and development of the original storyline that all previous Battlestar Galactica series history has been declared void by the writers and the story has gone through a creative renewal. This reimagining was done to enhance the concept... and the reboot has paid off in aces.The Cylons were created by man. They evolved. There are many copies. And they have a plan. In the past, there was a war. The Cylons left Earth. Now they are back and they want revenge. They chase and try to kill the fleet across the galaxy.Battlestar Galactica has a lot of surprises in store. The story itself is kept tightly under wraps because there is a huge twist concerning the Cylons. Even the box covers are illusive.There is lots of powerhouse acting. Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) quickly becomes one of the most memorable characters in television history (you can rank him up there with the likes of Captain Picard). Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) slowly transcends into a pivotal character as catastrophes unfold. Starbuck is somebody very new and the role will amaze fans. Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama (Jamie Bamber) brings a new breed of hero to the table and Dr. Gaius Baltar (James Callis) is the science geek with a secret to hide. Number Six (Tricia Helfer) will stun everybody with her looks and cold-blooded cruelty. Leoben Conoy (Callum Keith Rennie) is the con on the loose. Colonel Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) is the second in command with a drinking problem and who has no qualms about venting his staff into space. Lt. Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii (Grace Park) is a pilot with a heart of gold dating Chief Petty Officer Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) who does his best to make sure the ships are ready for launch and not blowing up in the service area. This is but a small section of the enormous cast that Battlestar Galactica has to offer. Expect lots of high-voltage drama in with the rapid paced action scenes.Razor is twofold. It is a back story about Commander William Adama's experience with the cylons (retro looking like from the 70s series) and explains some time lapses found in Season 2 when Lee 'Apollo' Adama assumed command of the Pegasus. While this isn't an essential (you can still follow BGS without seeing it) it does reveal more about the prelude to the cylon invasion, the development of the evolved cylons and hybridizing. There are some awesome action sequences and high voltage tension.If you are a fan of the show, get it. If you haven't seen the series, hold back until you have seen up to Season 3. When it comes to SF on TV, the makers of Battlestar Galactica are trying to actually match the superiority of Star Trek... and they are doing just that!",5,Buy Your Command,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,3193,"['Watch', 'finish', 'Season', '3', 'BGS', 'are', 'expecting', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', '2003', 'Miniseries', 'Razor', 'action', 'not', 'groundbreaking', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'film', 'was', 'running', '101', 'minutes', 'still', 'cutting', 'edge', 'television', 'none-the-less', 'Razor', 'not', 'yet', 'available', 'part', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'seasons', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'standalone', 'DVD.Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'barely', 'recognizable', '1970s', 'original', 'series', 'Such', 'scope', 'makeover', 'development', 'original', 'storyline', 'previous', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'series', 'history', 'been', 'declared', 'void', 'writers', 'story', 'gone', 'creative', 'renewal', 'reimagining', 'was', 'done', 'enhance', 'concept', 'reboot', 'paid', 'off', 'aces.The', 'Cylons', 'were', 'created', 'man', 'evolved', 'are', 'many', 'copies', 'have', 'plan', 'past', 'was', 'war', 'Cylons', 'left', 'Earth', 'Now', 'are', 'back', 'want', 'revenge', 'chase', 'try', 'kill', 'fleet', 'galaxy.Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'lot', 'surprises', 'store', 'story', 'kept', 'tightly', 'wraps', 'huge', 'twist', 'concerning', 'Cylons', 'Even', 'box', 'covers', 'are', 'illusive.There', 'lots', 'powerhouse', 'acting', 'Commander', 'William', 'Adama', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'quickly', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'television', 'history', 'can', 'rank', 'up', 'there', 'likes', 'Captain', 'Picard', 'Laura', 'Roslin', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'slowly', 'pivotal', 'character', 'catastrophes', 'unfold', 'Starbuck', 'somebody', 'very', 'new', 'role', 'will', 'amaze', 'fans', 'Captain', 'Lee', ""'Apollo"", 'Adama', 'Jamie', 'Bamber', 'new', 'breed', 'hero', 'table', 'Dr.', 'Gaius', 'Baltar', 'James', 'Callis', 'science', 'geek', 'secret', 'hide', 'Number', 'Six', 'Tricia', 'Helfer', 'will', 'stun', 'everybody', 'looks', 'cold-blooded', 'cruelty', 'Leoben', 'Conoy', 'Callum', 'Keith', 'Rennie', 'con', 'loose', 'Colonel', 'Saul', 'Tigh', 'Michael', 'Hogan', 'second', 'command', 'drinking', 'problem', 'who', 'qualms', 'venting', 'staff', 'space', 'Lt.', 'Sharon', 'Valerii', 'Grace', 'Park', 'pilot', 'heart', 'gold', 'dating', 'Chief', 'Petty', 'Officer', 'Galen', 'Tyrol', 'Aaron', 'Douglas', 'who', 'best', 'make', 'sure', 'ships', 'are', 'ready', 'launch', 'not', 'blowing', 'up', 'service', 'area', 'small', 'section', 'enormous', 'cast', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'offer', 'Expect', 'lots', 'high-voltage', 'drama', 'rapid', 'paced', 'action', 'scenes.Razor', 'twofold', 'back', 'story', 'Commander', 'William', 'Adama', 'experience', 'cylons', 'retro', 'looking', '70s', 'series', 'time', 'lapses', 'found', 'Season', '2', 'when', 'Lee', ""'Apollo"", 'Adama', 'assumed', 'command', 'Pegasus', ""n't"", 'essential', 'can', 'still', 'follow', 'BGS', 'seeing', 'reveal', 'more', 'prelude', 'cylon', 'invasion', 'development', 'evolved', 'cylons', 'hybridizing', 'are', 'awesome', 'action', 'sequences', 'high', 'voltage', 'tension.If', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'get', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'hold', 'back', 'have', 'seen', 'up', 'Season', '3', 'When', 'SF', 'TV', 'makers', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'are', 'trying', 'actually', 'match', 'superiority', 'Star', 'Trek', 'are', 'doing', 'just']",N/A

After reviewing the files of the officers Apollo lands on Officer Kendra Shaw (Stephanie Jacobsen). After Kendra's introduction, her perspective of the events that took place on Pegasus prior to meeting up with the Galactica are interwoven with a tale taking place in the present which is connected with something that happened to Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) in the past. Present and past adventure ensues...The description of ""Razor"" may leave you thinking this is a convoluted telling but the stories are actually cleverly interwoven and well told. We see on Pegasus the way things may have unfolded on Galactica if Adoma had been without his moral sounding board of Leigh and President Roslin. A much darker turn of event took place on Pegasus which was spoken of in the regular series but the blanks are filled in here.The Good: All the same things you enjoy in the regular on going series from most of your favorite characters to surprisingly good effects for space battle scenes and interesting directing which is always present and gives the show its unique look.

1098812,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B000V5IP6K,Patrick L. Randall,"[0, 0]","""Razor"" is an interesting untold story from the BSG universe.  It covers the period of time from just before the Cylon holocaust to the conclusion of events aboard the Battlestar Pegasus with Admiral Cain (Michelle Forbes) from the point of view of the Pegasus crew.In the main BSG series, Admiral Cain's cruelty and unyielding nature was quite evident.  In ""Razor"" many of the stories that were told about her cruelty are depicted graphically here, including her assassination of her first officer for refusing obey an order sending the fighters out into a certain slaughter, and the cannibalization of a civilian ship that survived that Cylon attack, leaving the non-valuable members of the crew behind, without supplies, to be killed when the Cylons eventually found them.  In addition, greater weight is leant to the backstory of the Six named Gina, who Cain ordered to be brutally tortured.The title ""Razor"" has a double meaning.  It references the type of edge Admiral Cain expects all of her military to be because she believes it is truly the only way they can survive and defeat the Cylons.  It is also a reference to XO Kendra Shaw, a green recruit who joined the Pegasus crew immediately before the Cylons launched their attack.  Cain saw to it that Shaw was molded in her image and served in that capacity throughout the missions depicted in ""Razor""; missions which began to completely change the focus of how the humans viewed their interaction, and war, with the Cylons.Shaw is an interesting addition to the canon of characters (she was not in any of the main series episodes), and ""Razor"" is a good addition to the BSG narrative.

All in all, it makes me have even less sympathy for some characters that didn't garner a lot of it to begin with.  It's like an entire show based around The Wicked Witch of the West where we're sitting there watching a character we don't like do things we don't approve of.  What's the point?  There were no emotional highs and it just wasn't very entertaining.  We're introduced to a new ""one off"" character that doesn't drive the plot and is just another person we can't sympathize with.I feel like BSG has been injecting too much politics into the show lately.  Cylons as the occupiers?  Colonials as terrorists engaging in suicide bombings?  Ruthless officers who shoot civilians and leave the rest of them to die, then shoots anyone who objects?I mean really, where is this show even going anymore?  It started out strong but lately it's been injecting an awful lot of rubbish.We even find that the younger Adama is willing to sacrifice his friends for military objectives of rather dubious, vaguely defined importance -- something he certainly didn't seem willing to do in Exodus II (season 3, ep 4).Am I watching epic sci-fi or am I watching MSNBC?Lets get back to a powerful show with powerful characters.  If I want to feel bad about humanity I can watch Pan's Labyrinth again, or the evening news.For BSG fans, I think you can skip this episode entirely.

I've not experienced this level of fresh, original writing in .... well, forever!  The acting is top notch, the sci-fi is believable, and most of all, the characters are the the kind you like, you love, you hate, you FEEL something for.  Even the Galactica looks and FEELS SIMILAR to the ship on which I served during my Naval service.  It's a no-frills fighting machine that carries people, just like any ship in our fleet today.  Go down to the ""hole"" (engine room), of the BSG, and I'm willing to bet the biggest difference between that ship and the USS Ogden LPD-5 (my old ship), would be the FTL Drive, their power systems, O2 generators, but the pipes, screws, grease, and passageways will all be similar.It's these similarities that make this series a HIT in my book.But, what about RAZOR???This show gives the viewer a different side of human survival.  This group do the things we hope none of us would EVER do under the color of war.  We see how the Battlestar Atlantis escaped certain destruction when the Cylons attacked the Colonies.  We find out why Adm. Cain HATED her #6 with such venom (with good cause).  After all, hell hath no fury as a woman scorned by a very HOT, Wiley, yet murderous cyborg.This movie is worthwhile, and human.  However, RAZOR is for those of us who are BSG fans already.  It's full of insider information, answers to questions raised in shows already aired.  RAZOR introduces some new characters, fleshes out others and even shows us the Commander when he was a mere Lt flying against Cylons in the first war when the bad guys looked like ""Toasters with legs"".  The disc has several ""minisodes"" of the adventures of Lt Adama, and the first war against Cylons.

Humans ventured into space as outcasts aboard the military spaceship Galactica and a few other civilian spaceships. They thought that they were the only survivors, and they set out to find a planet called Earth. However, they soon find out that another military spaceship survived the Ceylon attack--the Pagasus. Its commander, the ruthless Admiral Cain, was introduced to us in seasons 1 and 2. Now in Razor, the untold story of Pegasus is told. We are introduced to a new character, Kendra Shaw, who has been reshaped into a razor--a tool of war.This is actually the first episode of season 4. I loved the character of Kendra Shaw, but overall, I found the show a bit slow and unbelievable. I also didn't like the jumping back and forth in time to tell the story of Cain and Shaw.

This was typical BSG and I was extremely happy with this intro movie for the next season chronicaling what happened on the Pegasus before and after Lee Adama's command. I would advise any Battlestar fan to get it.This movie shows you that Admiral Cain was once a warm, and caring commander with a great sense of humor before the Cylons turned her into a crazed bloodthirsty warlord. I'm a Cain fan, before and after her change, I see her as a true war Admiral but the fans and I have already had that argument. This movie was very revealing, and after watching it I cannot imagine the series without it.This is not a stand-alone movie, it is for collectors as a ""what happened"" for explanation on the Pegasus tragedy. The movie starts with Kendra Shaw, an ex-Captain of the Pegasus being interviewed by Lee Adama about some of the happenings on the Pegasus. We are treated to flashbacks of Admiral Cain as a softer dynamic, being a leader and mentor to her staff along with having meals full of laughter and love from her friends.  The cylons break the peace and shatter the hull of the Pegasus killing a quarter of the crew, and breaking the Admiral's heart and producing a ruthlessly cold weapon in Admiral Cain.Razor: The DVDWell after purchasing the DVD I must say that I am extemely happy for doing so. The extras that comes coupled with the movie includes some mini-film goodies of young Bill ""Husker"" Adama and also some footage of young Admiral Cain.

1098837,A2FIMQIKNOHFPK,B000V5IP6K,S. White,"[2, 2]","The story of RAZOR has already been well detailed by other reviewers here so I will keep my review to pure analysis of the episode assuming that people reading this are already fans of the BSG series.In Razor we get the missing back story of the Pegasus told in parallel time lines - Past with Admiral Caine and present with Lee Adama. The bridge between these two times lines, apart from the Pegasus crew under Caine, is one Kendra Shaw played by Australian actress Stephanie Jacobsen. It should be said from the outset that most North Americans will not recognize her accent and think it is English ... it is not, it is a standard neutral Australian accent.It was great to hear a familiar Aussie accent within the BSG story line and Jacobsen as Kendra Shaw proves herself to be every bit as tough and resourceful as Kara Thrace ( Starbuck ). In one scene when William Adama and Lee are watching Kendra Shaw drill a team of marines for weapons training Adama Snr comments ""I'd like to sell tickets to that dance"" when it is revealed that Starbuck and Shaw don't get along. We get the distinct impression that something inside Kendra Shaw is quite broken, perhaps even more broken than Starbucks emotional past. This sets us up for the past events of the Pegasus under Caine which begin to unfold.Kendra Shaw is the legacy and product of Admiral Caine, during Razor we witness the back story explaining what makes Admiral Caine the woman she is, as well as what drives her ultimate Raison D'etre. The results of her hard nosed and single bloody mindedness culminate with devastating consequences on two occasions during RAZOR's back story as well as revealing her motivation behind the treatment under interrogation of the Cylon No6. In one scene we see Caine playing with a folding knife keepsake where she states to Kendra Shaw ... ""When you can be this, as long as you have to be ... then you become a razor"".The story of Razor in a metaphorical sense explores the theme that in a war of survival of the human race people are often required to do things and act in ways that are contrary to our morality and common code of normal behaviour. That to win against machines human beings are often required to set their emotional life aside and become nothing more than a weapon ... a razor. The dilemma in all this however is that nobody can survive being a Razor indefinitely without having it exact a heavy toll. Everybody is emotionally scarred, nobody is left unscathed - this is the paradox of our humanity. We even realize as the seasons roll on that the Cylons themselves are not free from the heavy burden of human feelings and emotions, this seems to be their very own Achilles heel.In the modern day we see Lee Adama being given command of the Pegasus where we initially find Kendra Shaw working the kitchens having been previously busted back to nothing for repeated insubordination after Admiral Caine's murder at the hands of the Cylons. Lee Adama realizes that he needs a strong personality who represents the past life of the Pegasus crew and after some verbal jousting assigns Shaw as his new Executive Officer.As the episode gathers pace Adama Snr transfers over the Pegasus to oversee a mission to discover the nature of a strange hybrid fleet of Cylons which takes us into a third back story involving William Adama and the first Cylon  War. It is this back story that really impressed me as a BSG fan from the orignal series in the late 70's ... I grew up with the original Galactica and the entire sequence with young Adama quite frankly rocked! There were many cool references to old school Cylons ( Toasters ) and the old school Cylon Raiders and Vipers. There is one particular scene in this sequence where the rookie Adama takes on two Cylon Raiders resulting in an incredible free falling fight scene.To spell anything else out would get into spoilers but while I loved this addition to the series there were a couple of moments that I found a tad weak - sadly I will not be able to reveal them here for the sake of those who have yet to watch Razor but rest assured they aren't big enough to drop this rating from 5 stars. RAZOR is superb and we need more BSG!I wish they would make more prequels and back stories for BSG ... the guy that plays the young Adama could easily lead up a series based on the first Cylon Wars ...

Tight writing. Non stop action. And the hint of what is to come...""Razor"" is an amazing episode. The story of power transfer aboard the Pegasus with the death of Commander Cain to Lee Adama is compelling, and the multi-layered plot lines interset at a single fine line...a razor sharp knife handed down from Cain to Kendra Shaw to Starbuck. Lee Adama, with his assumption of command of the Pegasus, struggles with the assignment. Choosing non-Pegasus officers will alienate the crew of the ship. Choosing Pegasus personel will ensure a less than peaceful transfer of power.The son of Adama chose wisely. Kendra Shaw was both Cains' XO and a natural choice for Lee. Even with her checkered past and blind obedience to Cain, her experience and mental toughness were assets to the fleet. Survival in space could and did mean difficult choices. Killing for supplies, and abandonment of surivors brought both commendation and condemnation. Survivors tells tales where dead men cannot. Shaw survived sharper, more wise, and colder.Her final test came when a bold plan to draw the cylons away (the old ones) from the fleet lead to one ship and a chilling prediction of the future of mankind. While Adama fought with Adama over deployment of nuclear weaons, Shaw learned and warned as she could. Her final revelation could not be delivered, and her final act was one of heroism and legacy.This is such an important episode. Drawing viewers back and forth from past to present, the direction and plot lines fill in many gaps. The revelation that Adama was there at the armistice and witnessed the `birth`of the hybrid Cylons gives much clarity to his cynicism.

BSG is one of the few shows that I've kept in my DVD collection (along with Wonderfalls and a couple of others) after first viewing.  It's usually always good enough to warrant more than one viewing.The two best episodes in the new BSG series are arguably (if not definitively) ""33"" and ""Exodus Part II.""  The former for its tension and psychological drama, the latter for special effects and the whole victorious (ala ""Rocky"" winning the title fight) feeling it induces as the humans kick Cylon butt for once.  So an extended movie length episode, fans would hope, would strive to reach the heights of these great moments in the series.As good as it is, ""Razor"" really is just a filler episode to fend off the the demanding fans in the lengthly lull between seasons three and four.This episode focuses mostly on Kendra Shaw, a completely new character, who carries on the heavy stick personality of Adm. Cain.  Stephanie Chaves-Jacobsen, who plays Shaw, is yet another BSG looker and she can act.  She just can't act this specific role which demands that she be Cain's legacy.  Michelle Forbes, who plays Cain, is an psychopathic ice queen.  You believe she's capable of killing innocent civilians to fulfill her military goals.  Shaw . . . not so much.  Too petite, too sweet looking.  I guess they were looking for some ambiguity, someone that viewers wouldn't hate like so many do with Cain.  It's just not a compelling character to watch.The second flaw, and perhaps far bigger than the Shaw character, is the constant flipping back and forth through time.  There's the first Cylon war, the second war - the invasion, and present day.  This destroys whatever dramatic tension that's built in the show.  Look at ""33"" and ""Exodus Part II"" and you'll see that they're tight and focused.  This one is all over the map.  Why the producers didn't see this problem is baffling. They were so concerned with making sure we understood everything (too excess IMO - e.g. the depiction of young Cain abandoning her younger sister seemed unnecessary) that they forgot they needed to make a compelling show.The extras on the DVD are cool.  The ""Favorite Episode"" is interesting as is ""The Look of Battlestar Galactica"" - although that ground has been covered before.  Haven't watched the commentary version, but I suspect it will be good as well.Razor is worth watching, despite these flaws.

What about her shooting of her XO when he won't follow her orders, or when she orders the killing of several families when they resist her orders as well?She is willing to do whatever is necessary to defeat the Cylons, but one must wonder if her actions ever keep her up at night and if she can ever fully recover her humanity later.

1098851,AQFGSOIZXWRS7,B000V5IP6K,Your Role Model,"[8, 8]","Just finished watching the entire DVD, 'extras' and all, and I was moderately impressed. It's not quite up to par with the best of the new Galactica (the Miniseries, '33', 'Home', 'Scar'), but it's a lot better than most of the terribly mediocre Season 3, which gives me hope.Before I go on, let me say that the above point is important because Galactica has been in a downward quality spiral ever since they switched from 13 episode seasons to 20 episode seasons. As showrunner Ronald Moore said once, when you have so much less time, it's harder to make each episode special, and that's exactly what happened when the new production schedule started to catch up to Galactica late in Season 2.Thus we had such memorably mediocre episodes as ""Black Market"" and ""Sacrifice"", and BSG fans started to wonder what the heck had happened, when such a great show had seemingly become so hit-or-miss from episode to episode.Season 3 unfortunately confirmed our worst fears. BSG's creators worried that putting everyone on a planet (New Caprica) would be a leap too far, but really, the idea was fine. It was the EXECUTION of that idea that was lacking. Honestly, if it wasn't for the uber-cool way they got off New Caprica (burning Battlestars and such), it would have been a total wash.Then we got a bunch of mostly filler episodes (anyone remember 'The Woman King'? Bad, huh?), and then, FINALLY, a good story arc in the middle of the season with the 'Eye of Jupiter' two-parter. Then back to bunch of mostly filler/bad episodes, until the courtroom season finale, which was a lot less cool and a lot more forced/contrived than we'd like to remember (Galactica REALLY needs to get away from the idea that one of the 'Big Three'- Apollo, Starbuck, Adama- has to be front and center in EVERY subplot. Apollo as a lawyer in a key trial is even more silly/out of place than Starbuck as a sniper/SWAT team member, as she has been at times. If you need a central marine character for some episodes, make one. New characters are good.What's next, Adama elbowing Doc Codell aside to perform open-heart surgery? Yeesh.)Then there was Starbuck coming back from the dead, which was great, except that we kinda all saw it coming, and we, sadly, didn't care that much when she died in the first place, because the character had been allowed to degenerate so much since her glory days in Seasons 1 and 2.Whew! Sorry about all that, but it helps put my comments on 'Razor' into context.For example, if you've had to suffer through the crappy, childish, unsympathetic dud of a Starbuck that was Season 3 Kara Thrace (and we all have), then watching 'Razor' will be a revelation. ""Ohhh-hhh!"", you'll go. ""That's the OLD Kara, the one I actually LIKED! Why the FRAK did they stop writing her like that?!?"".There's also a certain increase in the passion and energy level in general. I dunno, it's hard to put one's finger on it, but watching most of Season 3, you get the feeling sometimes that everyone was sort of going through the motions... the writers, directors, producers, some of the actors, the crew, the entire food chain from top to bottom in general, not because they're bad at what they do (on the contrary, they're some of the best), but because they were being pushed along at an unreasonable pace, and just had to get the damn episode DONE.For what it's worth, this was a huge problem on the original Battlestar Galactica as well, with, in some cases, actors having to read lines off of cue cards. I doubt things got quite THAT bad with the new series, but you can definitely feel the energy/sharpness difference between Season 3 and S1/early-mid S2.Doesn't hurt that Michelle Forbes is back as Cain, and as good as ever. The backstory on her and her rationale for what she does and how she does it is important, as it was too easy to see Cain as simply an over-zealous nutjob before, in the Season 2 Pegasus two-parter (and I think it says a lot about Michelle Forbes' ability that we mostly DIDN'T dismiss her as such back then, even without backstory, but it was close).You can actually understand why Kendra Shaw becomes her protege. Cain is strong, and there is no doubt, remorse, or second-guessing in her world. So when the Apocalypse hits and your entire civilization has been wiped out, who's more charismatic, and who are you more likely to follow... a strong, decisive leader, a 'razor', even if they have huge flaws; or someone who's merely human and let's you see it?We'd all LIKE to believe that we'd still choose the latter, but I have my doubts. There are parallels to 9/11 and a certain President I could name.Of course, if there is a flaw in 'Razor' (aside from the slightly confusing back-and-forth jumps in time between plotlines, as others have mentioned), it's that we aren't given quite backstory ENOUGH on Cain and the Pegasus' travails to fully come to see why she does some of the things she does. Her attack and pyrrhic victory over a Cylon base doesn't make much sense and needed a better explanation, as did her stripping of the civilian fleet for spare parts, food, fuel, and skilled personnel. Yeah, I suppose I can fill in the blanks on my own, but a couple of brief scenes along those lines would've made a big difference, and I sense I'm far from alone on this.And it would've helped 'Razor' actually EARN it's ending, where Adama basically says if he had had to walk a mile in Cain's moccasins, perhaps he would've done the things she did. It's a nice try, but it doesn't quite ring true, for the reasons I mention above.Another, though more minor, disappointment is that the extent of Cain and Gina's personal relationship is only touched on very briefly. There should've been at least one scene between the two of them as (no other way to put it) lovers, so that the extent of Gina's betrayal and Cain's horrifyingly brutal reaction would've had more power behind it.I'm making it sound like I don't like 'Razor', but actually I do. It's great to see Kara and Cain chew up the scenery like there's no tomorrow, the special effects budget was given a BIG boost (and boy does it show), the return of the original series Cylon centurions and raiders was a nice touch, and there's just more energy, grittiness, passion, and sharpness all around. Plus, the guy they have playing young Bill Adama in one of the flashbacks positively NAILS the role! (hope we see more of Adama's past in Season 4).In any case, THIS is the Galactica I've been missing since late Season 2, and if I'm pointing out weaknesses, its only out of frustration due to the fact that they were so CLOSE to knocking it out of the park on this one. This one's more like a solid ground-rule double.In the end, 4 stars out of 5 (didn't help that the DVD extras were so skimpy). I'm really REALLY hoping Season 4 is five stars... Ronnie D, don't get distracted by your other projects, the show needs you to have a tight hand on the rudder for Galactica to truly go out with the bang it deserves.So say we all.",4,Oh My Gods!
