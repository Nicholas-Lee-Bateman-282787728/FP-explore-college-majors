This is one of those you'll wonder whether you've watched it or not a few years down the road.  You just can't remember.All in all, I figure it's still better to watch a so-so Sci Fi/Horror movie than ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Evita"".

22287,A13O657KERIMMX,0767848535,Harry F. Korbl,"[2, 3]","Written, Directed & Produced by Phillip J. Roth, this film is a good example of how to make a B Movie (B for BAD not B for 2nd rate). This was Roth's 9th film as Director, so I would have thought that he would have learned something about film making by the time he got this far. I suppose directors have to learn their craft somehow, however, I don't believe that this excuses the release of such a bad film. Phillip J. Roth is now on my list of filmmakers to avoid.As for Olivier Gruner, what the film world doesn't need is a mannequin that talks. He should have stuck to skiing or kick-boxing or modelling if that's what he was good at. He would be OK as an Extra so long as he didn't get any lines.None of the players (I can't bring myself to call them actors) are believable in their roles. Once I had reached the shootout sequence, I couldn't watch any longer. I got so irritated by the predictability and stupidity of the story as well as the poor acting, that I hit the stop button.How this film ever got released is beyond me. This disk ended up in the rubbish bin where the original print should have gone instead of being transferred to DVD and unleashed on unsuspecting buyers.",1,Don't waste your time & money on this one,1209513600,"04 30, 2008",2008,1189,"['Written', 'Directed', 'Produced', 'Phillip', 'J.', 'Roth', 'film', 'good', 'example', 'how', 'make', 'B', 'Movie', 'B', 'BAD', 'not', 'B', '2nd', 'rate', 'was', 'Roth', '9th', 'film', 'Director', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'learned', 'something', 'film', 'making', 'time', 'got', 'far', 'suppose', 'directors', 'have', 'learn', 'craft', 'somehow', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'release', 'such', 'bad', 'film', 'Phillip', 'J.', 'Roth', 'now', 'list', 'filmmakers', 'avoid.As', 'Olivier', 'Gruner', 'what', 'film', 'world', ""n't"", 'need', 'mannequin', 'talks', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'skiing', 'kick-boxing', 'modelling', 'what', 'was', 'good', 'would', 'be', 'OK', 'Extra', 'so', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'lines.None', 'players', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'call', 'actors', 'are', 'believable', 'roles', 'Once', 'had', 'reached', 'shootout', 'sequence', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'longer', 'got', 'so', 'irritated', 'predictability', 'stupidity', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'poor', 'acting', 'hit', 'stop', 'button.How', 'film', 'ever', 'got', 'released', 'disk', 'ended', 'up', 'rubbish', 'bin', 'where', 'original', 'print', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'instead', 'being', 'transferred', 'DVD', 'unleashed', 'unsuspecting', 'buyers']",N/A
22288,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,0767848535,Michael Butts,"[12, 12]","VELOCITY TRAP is thematically an intergalactic western, replete with shootouts and bad guys vs. good guys.  Martial arts hero Olivier Gruner plays a cop who is framed for the murder of a fellow police officer and transferred as a security guard on a vessel hauling forty billion dollars in cash from banks from 32 planets!  Of course, some space pirates want that money so they dock onto the ship and proceed to terrorize the crew.  This crew includes Alicia Coppola (any relation to Francis Ford?) and Bruce Weitz as its crusty captain.  The thieves include Ken Olandt (A Time for Revenge), Jorja Fox and Jaason Simmons.  Craig Wasson has a brief role as a mining executive who also has a contract on Gruner's ex-wife; in the future, marriages are contracts that can be purchased for the right price.  This interesting element never gets full attention; we never know what happens in this regard.  The movie suffers from a quick climax, and one that tries hard to be ""cute"".  But not a bad film all around.  Special effects are pretty good for low budget film.",3,SPACE SHOOTOUT,1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,1061,"['VELOCITY', 'TRAP', 'thematically', 'intergalactic', 'western', 'replete', 'shootouts', 'bad', 'guys', 'vs.', 'good', 'guys', 'Martial', 'arts', 'hero', 'Olivier', 'Gruner', 'cop', 'who', 'framed', 'murder', 'fellow', 'police', 'officer', 'transferred', 'security', 'guard', 'vessel', 'hauling', 'forty', 'billion', 'dollars', 'cash', 'banks', '32', 'planets', 'course', 'space', 'pirates', 'want', 'money', 'dock', 'ship', 'proceed', 'terrorize', 'crew', 'crew', 'Alicia', 'Coppola', 'relation', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Bruce', 'Weitz', 'crusty', 'captain', 'thieves', 'include', 'Ken', 'Olandt', 'Time', 'Revenge', 'Jorja', 'Fox', 'Jaason', 'Simmons', 'Craig', 'Wasson', 'brief', 'role', 'mining', 'executive', 'who', 'also', 'contract', 'Gruner', 'ex-wife', 'future', 'marriages', 'are', 'contracts', 'can', 'be', 'purchased', 'right', 'price', 'interesting', 'element', 'never', 'full', 'attention', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'regard', 'movie', 'suffers', 'quick', 'climax', 'one', 'hard', 'be', 'cute', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'around', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'low', 'budget', 'film']",N/A
