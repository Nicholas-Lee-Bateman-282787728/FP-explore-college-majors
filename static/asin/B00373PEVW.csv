I've attended many training courses and have been taught different styles of combative handgun shooting.  These DVD's are a summary of many of the courses that are being taught across the country.This is a good DVD set to get if you are new or an experienced shooter.The quality of the production is extremely well done.Excellent purchase at an amazing price for the quality of the content and the amount of information given.,5,Excellent training DVDs,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,487,"['well', 'made', 'training', 'DVD', 'use', 'handgun', ""'ve"", 'attended', 'many', 'training', 'courses', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'different', 'styles', 'combative', 'handgun', 'shooting', 'DVD', 'are', 'summary', 'many', 'courses', 'are', 'being', 'taught', 'country.This', 'good', 'DVD', 'set', 'get', 'are', 'new', 'experienced', 'shooter.The', 'quality', 'production', 'extremely', 'well', 'done.Excellent', 'purchase', 'amazing', 'price', 'quality', 'content', 'amount', 'information', 'given']",N/A

The attempts to dramatize (especially in the final exam scenarios) was a bit much, but I think Costa and Haley were probably making some correct assumptions about their average viewer.

1329446,AN81JUYW2SL24,B00373PEVW,Gearhead Mania,"[6, 6]","Magpul Art of the Dynamic HandgunAfter having lots of trigger time with rifles and carbines, the handgun was difficult for me mainly for accurate/precision shooting at 25-50 yards. I didn't have an instructor teaching me, I only relied on books, articles, and help from Internet postings. After reading some reviews for the Magpul DVDs, I gave the Dynamic Handgun set a try to learn more about how to shoot these properly.The participants/cast didn't contribute much, although I found the Smith and Wesson rep to be very focused and hardcore. I kind of grew fond of the desert tan pistols. The red head female, Willard, was easy on the eyes but it seemed odd that at the end of Disc 2, where she dressed up like an executive and engaged the targets from the car, she seemed to totally forget all of the basic principles taught on Disc 1. She did the typical female shooter stance, where she arches backwards and as far away from the gun as possible and fired while standing. She even managed to hit the top of the car that she used as cover, which is what new Glocker shooters tend to do due to being unfamiliar with the trigger. I wonder if they filmed the dynamic scenarios first and then had the participants run through the course.Chris Costa is the better speaker, although Travis Haley doesn't seem like a bad instructor either. The first disc starts with the basics, which are the most important since that is half the battle with handguns. The instructions on proper grip was well done and the most useful. The pacing and layout of the exercises was just right and very fluid. Each course flowed into the next one, and it even felt real because Costa or Haley may forget a lesson and then catch up on the fly. It's not dry like a classroom lecture.I recommend new shooters and even experienced shooters check out this DVD set to brush up on handguns. They're not as easy to shoot as rifles/carbines in my opinion, and this DVD breaks down the mechanism into easy to understand portions.Overall: 4/5 stars.",4,Excellent primer on handguns and covers some advanced tactics,1323648000,"12 12, 2011",2011,2013,"['Magpul', 'Art', 'Dynamic', 'HandgunAfter', 'having', 'lots', 'trigger', 'time', 'rifles', 'carbines', 'handgun', 'was', 'difficult', 'mainly', 'accurate/precision', 'shooting', '25-50', 'yards', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'instructor', 'teaching', 'only', 'relied', 'books', 'articles', 'help', 'Internet', 'postings', 'reading', 'reviews', 'Magpul', 'DVDs', 'gave', 'Dynamic', 'Handgun', 'set', 'try', 'learn', 'more', 'how', 'shoot', 'properly.The', 'participants/cast', 'did', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'much', 'found', 'Smith', 'Wesson', 'rep', 'be', 'very', 'focused', 'hardcore', 'kind', 'grew', 'fond', 'desert', 'tan', 'pistols', 'red', 'head', 'female', 'Willard', 'was', 'easy', 'eyes', 'seemed', 'odd', 'end', 'Disc', '2', 'where', 'dressed', 'up', 'executive', 'engaged', 'targets', 'car', 'seemed', 'totally', 'forget', 'basic', 'principles', 'taught', 'Disc', '1', 'did', 'typical', 'female', 'shooter', 'stance', 'where', 'backwards', 'far', 'away', 'gun', 'possible', 'fired', 'standing', 'even', 'managed', 'hit', 'top', 'car', 'used', 'cover', 'what', 'new', 'Glocker', 'shooters', 'tend', 'do', 'due', 'being', 'unfamiliar', 'trigger', 'wonder', 'filmed', 'dynamic', 'scenarios', 'first', 'then', 'had', 'participants', 'run', 'course.Chris', 'Costa', 'better', 'speaker', 'Travis', 'Haley', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bad', 'instructor', 'first', 'disc', 'basics', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'battle', 'handguns', 'instructions', 'proper', 'grip', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'most', 'useful', 'pacing', 'layout', 'exercises', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'very', 'fluid', 'course', 'flowed', 'next', 'one', 'even', 'felt', 'real', 'Costa', 'Haley', 'may', 'forget', 'lesson', 'then', 'catch', 'up', 'fly', 'not', 'dry', 'classroom', 'lecture.I', 'recommend', 'new', 'shooters', 'even', 'experienced', 'shooters', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'set', 'brush', 'up', 'handguns', ""'re"", 'not', 'easy', 'shoot', 'rifles/carbines', 'opinion', 'DVD', 'down', 'mechanism', 'easy', 'understand', 'portions.Overall', '4/5', 'stars']",N/A

1329448,A2GVVAO242EK1D,B00373PEVW,J. W. Mullins,"[32, 32]","Magpul has done it again. This new four disc set covers a course worth of material on the use of the Dynamic Handgun. Magpuls two previous videos, The Art of the Tactical Carbine I&II; where both outstanding as well and set high benchmarks for firearm training DVDs. I am glad to see that The Art of the Dynamic Handgun has maintained that and in places raised the bar.The DVD is really a recording of a class they are actually teaching and it helps you feel like you are there to learn, not just watch. The level of shooters in the class various from military, police and civilian and includes one woman who is new to guns and just wants to learn more who you can really see progress over the course of the training. They show all the good and the bad, if someone screws up they identify what they did, why, and how to fix it and then watch them fix it. A lot of schools have their own 'methods and rules' they follow and teach. Magpul's instructors do things a certain way as well, but they make it clear it isn't the only way, its is one way that works and you should try it and if there is something that works better for you, use that. I enjoy that.The camera work and production values are of course exceptional. That is really the greatest things Magpul has done for firearm training DVDs, they made them interesting to watch. My wife shoots but only to proficiency, its not something she does for fun, but she watched the Magpul videos and even enjoyed them. That says a lot to me. There is so much good information on this four disc set you are sure to watch it more than once and parts more often than that. The last disc is a series of lessons where they show you draws, drills and the like but do so at varying speed, starting at 100% and then slowing it down so you can really watch in detail what is going on. That is a great touch.This set is well worth the money for any serious shooter or anyone who wants to get better. You don't need to be a shooter already to enjoy this, it might actually even help if you aren't since it would help you learn it right the first time instead of having to relearn it right later. So if you just picked up your first gun, are thinking about it, or have been a Special Forces soldier for thrity years, there is something in this video for everyone who wants to learn and my need to rely on their weapon to save a life",5,The closest you can get without going to class,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,2368,"['Magpul', 'done', 'again', 'new', 'four', 'disc', 'set', 'course', 'worth', 'material', 'use', 'Dynamic', 'Handgun', 'Magpuls', 'two', 'previous', 'videos', 'Art', 'Tactical', 'Carbine', 'II', 'where', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'set', 'high', 'benchmarks', 'firearm', 'training', 'DVDs', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'Art', 'Dynamic', 'Handgun', 'maintained', 'places', 'raised', 'bar.The', 'DVD', 'really', 'recording', 'class', 'are', 'actually', 'teaching', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'learn', 'not', 'just', 'watch', 'level', 'shooters', 'class', 'various', 'military', 'police', 'civilian', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'new', 'guns', 'just', 'learn', 'more', 'who', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'progress', 'course', 'training', 'show', 'good', 'bad', 'someone', 'identify', 'what', 'did', 'why', 'how', 'fix', 'then', 'watch', 'fix', 'lot', 'schools', 'have', 'own', ""'methods"", 'rules', 'follow', 'teach', 'Magpul', 'instructors', 'do', 'things', 'certain', 'way', 'well', 'make', 'clear', ""n't"", 'only', 'way', 'one', 'way', 'should', 'try', 'something', 'better', 'use', 'enjoy', 'that.The', 'camera', 'work', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'course', 'exceptional', 'really', 'greatest', 'things', 'Magpul', 'done', 'firearm', 'training', 'DVDs', 'made', 'interesting', 'watch', 'My', 'wife', 'shoots', 'only', 'proficiency', 'not', 'something', 'fun', 'watched', 'Magpul', 'videos', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'information', 'four', 'disc', 'set', 'are', 'sure', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'parts', 'more', 'often', 'last', 'disc', 'series', 'lessons', 'where', 'show', 'draws', 'drills', 'like', 'do', 'so', 'varying', 'speed', 'starting', '100', '%', 'then', 'slowing', 'down', 'so', 'can', 'really', 'watch', 'detail', 'what', 'going', 'great', 'touch.This', 'set', 'well', 'money', 'serious', 'shooter', 'anyone', 'who', 'get', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'shooter', 'already', 'enjoy', 'might', 'actually', 'even', 'help', 'are', ""n't"", 'would', 'help', 'learn', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'instead', 'having', 'relearn', 'right', 'later', 'So', 'just', 'picked', 'up', 'first', 'gun', 'are', 'thinking', 'have', 'been', 'Special', 'Forces', 'soldier', 'thrity', 'years', 'something', 'video', 'everyone', 'who', 'learn', 'need', 'rely', 'weapon', 'save', 'life']",N/A
