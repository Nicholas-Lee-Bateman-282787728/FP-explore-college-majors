909583,A3NW2MN6JH8OL3,B0009OL89Y,Almost 50 Lassie fan,"[3, 3]","Other reviewers have well-documented the film's story, so I won't repeat that.  Like the Magdalene Sisters (Anne-Marie Duff), this film deals with Catholic church-related controversy in Ireland; however, unlike the Magdalene laundries, the issues of celibacy and gayness among priests (and homophobia within the church because of it) occur globally within the church.  The story is very well-acted by many familiar faces, for those of us who watch PBS or Masterpiece Theater.  Pacing is adequate for the message.  Yes, issues are left unresolved at the end of the film, but that is a realistic ending, as those issues are unresolved in the church today.  Only one thing perhaps IS solved at the end, the conspiracy of silence is shattered and the church's hypocricy exposed on the previously mentioned issues.  I might also add, as is often the case, the priests in the film repeatedly mention God's will or God's church.  What the film condemns is NOT the Catholic church, but man's corruption within ""God's church"".",4,Strong film,1309824000,"07 5, 2011",2011,1017,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'well-documented', 'film', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'film', 'deals', 'Catholic', 'church-related', 'controversy', 'Ireland', 'however', 'Magdalene', 'laundries', 'issues', 'celibacy', 'gayness', 'priests', 'homophobia', 'church', 'globally', 'church', 'story', 'very', 'well-acted', 'many', 'familiar', 'who', 'watch', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'Pacing', 'adequate', 'message', 'Yes', 'issues', 'are', 'left', 'unresolved', 'end', 'film', 'realistic', 'ending', 'issues', 'are', 'unresolved', 'church', 'today', 'Only', 'one', 'thing', 'perhaps', 'solved', 'end', 'conspiracy', 'silence', 'shattered', 'church', 'hypocricy', 'exposed', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'issues', 'might', 'also', 'add', 'often', 'case', 'priests', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'mention', 'God', 'will', 'God', 'church', 'What', 'film', 'condemns', 'NOT', 'Catholic', 'church', 'man', 'corruption', 'God', 'church']",N/A

909585,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0009OL89Y,Grady Harp,"[13, 13]","CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE is a moody, dark, probing inquiry into the concept of celibacy of priests in the Catholic Church in Ireland and all the way to the Vatican.  The concept, story and script by Writer/Director John Deery are tight, arrow sharp in aim, but ultimately unresolved issues cloud the success of what could have been a pungent movie.Set in a seminary in Ireland for preparing young men for the priesthood, we are introduced to some warmly human characters such as Daniel McLaughlin (Jonathan Forbes), a squeaky clean lad who gave up a girlfriend Sinead (Catherine Walker) to follow his (and his family's) life ambition to become a priest.  Naive, warm, loving, athletic and bright, he is the seminary poster boy - until one evening after hours he innocently visits a fellow seminarian's room and is the focus of seduction by the student who kindly says 'we're all only human and have our needs'.  Daniel gently declines the advances, leaves the student's room but is observed by an old priest with demons of his own.  The priest reports the incident and Daniel is abruptly thrown out of the seminary by the evil Rector Cathal (Sean McGinley) for being homosexual - a charge that couldn't be farther from the truth.At the same time in another part of the seminary the fine Father Sweeney dresses in all his priestly regalia and commits suicide is a gruesome way.  His suicide is threatening to the staff of the seminary and a cover-up is immediately put in place. It seems Father Sweeney some four years ago had stirred controversy in the Vatican by publicly exposing his HIV status, alerting the Church and the world that HIV was rampant in the world wide Church. His partner left the priesthood, disillusioned, but following FR Sweeney to the seminary in Ireland.An earnest reporter David Foley (Jason Barry) begins the investigation of the suicide and in doing so finds the reason for Daniel's expulsion as well as the myriad dark secrets being covered by the Church - all to do with the concept of celibacy and the inevitable sequelae of sensual deprivation on priests.  One Father Jack Dowling (Hugh Bonneville) supports David and Daniel and is disenchanted with the behavior of the Church against its own priests.  Then, without resolving any of these fascinating strings of thought the movie ends, leaving many questions unanswered - as though there are no answers.The acting is uniformly strong (including the likes of Brenda Fricker as Daniel's mother et al), for once giving a spectrum of the priesthood that is not favoring bad or good.  These characters are men with convictions and none can be faulted for their stances.  The setting in Ireland is magnificently captured by cinematographer Jason Lehel,  and Francis Haines and Stephen W. Parsons provide a hauntingly beautiful musical score. As far as it takes us this is a fine film.  Perhaps Deery is planning Part II to finish this story!

909586,A2JBVRCJ8VS7PQ,B0009OL89Y,Jerry (Celil) Parker,"[0, 0]","This is yet another film about the tensions and hypocrisy regarding the interlinked issues of celibacy and homosexuality among Roman Catholic Church clergy, as much within the higher ranks of the clergy (bishops and cardinals) as among priests. Apparently the movie is based upon real events, but the kind of interlocking scandals that the film depicts have become ever more so common that one wonders just which scandal, of so many, inspired this film! Well, it was, obviously, one that took place in Ireland, the setting of the film; that nation (rather later than most in Europe and the Americas) has joined the ranks of Catholic countries whose populations have been setting themselves adrift in recent decades from the Roman Church over the likes of such issues and scandals.Here, an honest seminarian suffers from seminary staff's and administrators' harsh legalism and unjustly lewd accusations. As well, a bishop's hypocrisy, impacts directly two priests in the plot and blows ""the Church"" open to public scandal. Blah-blah-blah, but the film is a fine one, for the most part, and rather gripping. The chief criticism is that the action stops so abruptly after the sudden and dramatic revelation, on the the broadcast media, of the bishop's probable turpitude and dishonesty which have resulted in so much harm to others. The viewer cannot help, with frustration, but to wonder what the immediate consequence of all of that would be, especially for the seminarian and for the journalist, not to mention for the roguish bishop. (For more detailed accounts of the film's plot, the reviews, though few in number, on Amazon-U.S. are helpful in recounting it, as Wikipedia's article about the film also is useful.)As for the bilingual edition (French and English) of the DVD product (marketed in Canada as Chrystal Films 50631), it would have helped if there had been a ""special feature"" that would inform about the topical context of the motion picture and provide other insights into it. Given the Irish accents of the cast, subtitles would have proved helpful; even most Anglophones with better ears than the reviewer's have become with age are likely to have difficulty discerning all of the English dialogue without them. (The film can be viewed in French, too, again with no subtitles.)""Conspiracy of Silence"" is an enjoyable film, but one which is rather too stunted due to its excessively abrupt ending.",3,Gripping Drama of Clerical Abuse of Authority and Hushed-up Sexual Licentiousness,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,2414,"['yet', 'film', 'tensions', 'hypocrisy', 'regarding', 'interlinked', 'issues', 'celibacy', 'homosexuality', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'clergy', 'much', 'higher', 'ranks', 'clergy', 'bishops', 'cardinals', 'priests', 'Apparently', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'kind', 'interlocking', 'scandals', 'film', 'depicts', 'have', 'become', 'ever', 'more', 'so', 'common', 'one', 'wonders', 'just', 'scandal', 'so', 'many', 'inspired', 'film', 'Well', 'was', 'obviously', 'one', 'took', 'place', 'Ireland', 'setting', 'film', 'nation', 'rather', 'later', 'most', 'Europe', 'Americas', 'joined', 'ranks', 'Catholic', 'countries', 'populations', 'have', 'been', 'setting', 'adrift', 'recent', 'decades', 'Roman', 'Church', 'likes', 'such', 'issues', 'scandals.Here', 'honest', 'seminarian', 'suffers', 'seminary', 'staff', 'administrators', 'harsh', 'legalism', 'unjustly', 'lewd', 'accusations', 'well', 'bishop', 'hypocrisy', 'directly', 'two', 'priests', 'plot', 'Church', 'open', 'public', 'scandal', 'Blah-blah-blah', 'film', 'fine', 'one', 'most', 'part', 'rather', 'gripping', 'chief', 'criticism', 'action', 'so', 'abruptly', 'sudden', 'dramatic', 'revelation', 'broadcast', 'media', 'bishop', 'probable', 'turpitude', 'dishonesty', 'have', 'resulted', 'so', 'much', 'harm', 'others', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'frustration', 'wonder', 'what', 'immediate', 'consequence', 'would', 'be', 'especially', 'seminarian', 'journalist', 'not', 'mention', 'roguish', 'bishop', 'more', 'detailed', 'accounts', 'film', 'plot', 'reviews', 'few', 'number', 'Amazon-U.S.', 'are', 'helpful', 'recounting', 'Wikipedia', 'article', 'film', 'also', 'useful', 'bilingual', 'edition', 'French', 'English', 'DVD', 'product', 'marketed', 'Canada', 'Chrystal', 'Films', '50631', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'had', 'been', 'special', 'feature', 'would', 'inform', 'topical', 'context', 'motion', 'picture', 'provide', 'other', 'insights', 'Given', 'Irish', 'accents', 'cast', 'subtitles', 'would', 'have', 'proved', 'helpful', 'even', 'most', 'Anglophones', 'better', 'ears', 'reviewer', 'have', 'become', 'age', 'are', 'likely', 'have', 'difficulty', 'discerning', 'English', 'dialogue', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'French', 'too', 'again', 'subtitles', 'Conspiracy', 'Silence', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'one', 'rather', 'too', 'stunted', 'due', 'excessively', 'abrupt', 'ending']",N/A

The Roman Catholic Church paid out $50 M to 100 Alaskan Natives for sexual abuse practices makes this film all the more timely.The Church cannot continue to turn its back on the truth...because eventually the truth WILL set them and their victims free.",4,Celibate or not to be celibate?
