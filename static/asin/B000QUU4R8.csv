1077753,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B000QUU4R8,Amanda Richards,"[3, 6]","This adrenaline-pumping action movie is jam packed with exceptional performances, breath-taking high octane stunts, and beautiful bodies with trim hard lines. Never before has such a high level cast been assembled for a movie, and grown men have been known to break down and cry at the truly touching death scenes that will rock you to the core.Of course, I'm talking about the cars here, the only reason to watch this film with its absolutely horrible plot, worse acting and atrocious dialogue.  This is the point where I really should recap the plot for you, but then I'd have to look for it, which would mean watching the movie again without laughing.Using the Amazon rating system:Plot = 1 star (merely because I think it has one somewhere)Acting = 1 star (there's no lower rating)Tim Matheson + Eddie Griffin = 1 star (being generous)Nadia Bjorlin = 2 stars (a nice pair of ..... eyes)Cars and Stunts = 5 stars (there's no higher rating)Average: 2 starsConclusion: The cars ARE the only reason to watch this movie.A movie for car aficionados and gamers.Amanda Richards, September 25 2007",2,Give the cars an Oscar!!,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,1092,"['adrenaline-pumping', 'action', 'movie', 'jam', 'packed', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'breath-taking', 'high', 'octane', 'stunts', 'beautiful', 'bodies', 'trim', 'hard', 'lines', 'Never', 'before', 'such', 'high', 'level', 'cast', 'been', 'assembled', 'movie', 'grown', 'men', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'break', 'down', 'cry', 'truly', 'touching', 'death', 'scenes', 'will', 'rock', 'core.Of', 'course', ""'m"", 'talking', 'cars', 'here', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'plot', 'worse', 'acting', 'atrocious', 'dialogue', 'point', 'where', 'really', 'should', 'recap', 'plot', 'then', ""'d"", 'have', 'look', 'would', 'mean', 'watching', 'movie', 'again', 'laughing.Using', 'Amazon', 'rating', 'system', 'Plot', '1', 'star', 'merely', 'think', 'one', 'somewhere', 'Acting', '1', 'star', 'lower', 'rating', 'Tim', 'Matheson', '+', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', '=', '1', 'star', 'being', 'generous', 'Nadia', 'Bjorlin', '=', '2', 'stars', 'nice', 'pair', '..', 'eyes', 'Cars', 'Stunts', '=', '5', 'stars', 'higher', 'rating', 'Average', '2', 'starsConclusion', 'cars', 'ARE', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie.A', 'movie', 'car', 'aficionados', 'gamers.Amanda', 'Richards', 'September', '25', '2007']",N/A

A good villian is someone you want to be like...minus the bad traits. Darth Vader, Star Trek's Khan, the Joker, Hannibal Lector, and so on. Well add another role model villian on that list. Angus Macfadyen plays Michael D' Orazio...a billionaire who gambled big and lost. Some may see him as bizarre, but Michael is a complex, sensitive, and deep character. He has totally achieved what few people have: he isn't influenced by anyone else. This is the achievement of zen masters...thus, Michael has a master quality about him. Of course, in the movie he chooses to do foolish things that results in negative things happening to him. But that is just a movie role...but the character serves as a role model of rising above outward influence, above peer pressure, above anything other than what one wants.

1077758,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B000QUU4R8,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[1, 3]","The Fast and the Furious has become the recent standard by which all other car movies are compared to.  Not that there are even many out there to compare to, but Red Line is one of those few.  I was quite excited to learn that another racer was being released in theatres similar to Fast and the Furious.  I rather enjoyed those three movies thus far, and was hoping Red Line could add to the car movies with some orginality.  The previews showed us some great cars and race action.  Unfortunately, a preview can't quite show what an overall dissapointment the film can be.What makes Red Line still worth its buck are the cars.  These are true sports cars.  The real exotic deals.  Not that tricked out stuff in Fast and the Furious.  There is some race action, but that's where things begin to dwindle.  The race action was no where as intense as Fast and the Furious, and the final race was really the only scene I really enjoyed.  There are some scenes of Vegas in the movie, with lots of all those gorgeous bright neon lights.  And a small chase scene on the strip as well, too bad it was over rather quickly.Everyhting else about this movie suffers.  The story is basically about crazy men desperate to gamble big bucks on races.  They'll do almost anything, and one guy puts his nephews life on the line.  There are a variety of elements to the story that could provide some emotional depth and drama, but unfortunately a lacking script and ameatur actors keep things simple.  The soundtrack is what one would expect in this kind of movie - hip hop type tracks with a beat, though no songs I really found too familiar.  Most viewers seems to be in awe with all the girls in this movie too, but honestly it felt like pointless redundance, all of them standing around doing nothing.Overall, this is a weak film, but considering it was done in a b-movie tradition, its not too shabby.  The cars make this.  You may never see such a collection of exotic rides on the screen - and get destroyed.Acting - 2.5Action - 3Characters - 3Story - 3Overall - 3",3,Not quite what we were hoping for,1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,2052,"['Fast', 'Furious', 'become', 'recent', 'standard', 'other', 'car', 'movies', 'are', 'compared', 'Not', 'are', 'even', 'many', 'out', 'there', 'compare', 'Red', 'Line', 'one', 'few', 'was', 'quite', 'excited', 'learn', 'racer', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'theatres', 'similar', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'movies', 'thus', 'far', 'was', 'hoping', 'Red', 'Line', 'could', 'add', 'car', 'movies', 'orginality', 'previews', 'showed', 'great', 'cars', 'race', 'action', 'Unfortunately', 'preview', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'show', 'what', 'overall', 'dissapointment', 'film', 'can', 'be.What', 'Red', 'Line', 'still', 'worth', 'buck', 'are', 'cars', 'are', 'true', 'sports', 'cars', 'real', 'exotic', 'deals', 'Not', 'tricked', 'out', 'stuff', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'race', 'action', 'where', 'things', 'begin', 'dwindle', 'race', 'action', 'was', 'where', 'as', 'intense', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'final', 'race', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'scene', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'are', 'scenes', 'Vegas', 'movie', 'lots', 'gorgeous', 'bright', 'neon', 'lights', 'small', 'chase', 'scene', 'strip', 'as', 'well', 'too', 'bad', 'was', 'rather', 'quickly.Everyhting', 'else', 'movie', 'suffers', 'story', 'basically', 'crazy', 'men', 'desperate', 'gamble', 'big', 'bucks', 'races', ""'ll"", 'do', 'almost', 'anything', 'one', 'guy', 'nephews', 'life', 'line', 'are', 'variety', 'elements', 'story', 'could', 'provide', 'emotional', 'depth', 'drama', 'unfortunately', 'lacking', 'script', 'ameatur', 'actors', 'keep', 'things', 'simple', 'soundtrack', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'kind', 'movie', 'hip', 'hop', 'type', 'tracks', 'beat', 'songs', 'really', 'found', 'too', 'familiar', 'Most', 'viewers', 'be', 'awe', 'girls', 'movie', 'too', 'honestly', 'felt', 'pointless', 'redundance', 'standing', 'doing', 'nothing.Overall', 'weak', 'film', 'considering', 'was', 'done', 'b-movie', 'tradition', 'not', 'too', 'shabby', 'cars', 'make', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'such', 'collection', 'exotic', 'rides', 'screen', 'get', 'destroyed.Acting', '2.5Action', '3Characters', '3Story', '3Overall', '3']",N/A
1077759,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000QUU4R8,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[4, 8]","REDLINEI really have never been more disappointed in a movie before, I should have known from a Fast & Furious knock off. I was never a huge fan of those three films so I should not have expected much from this movie, but Eddie Griffin was in it so I just had to buy it. For that reason alone I bought this movie and now I am not sure if it was reason enough, Griffin is a great entertainer, this movie is far from entertaining. It seems every time I just buy something for one reason or another with out seeing it I end up regretting it, there are a few exceptions like ""Illusion"" but those a very few. The Fast & the Furious was entertaining, 2 Fast 2 Furious was at least some what entertaining, and even Tokyo Drift was much better then this despite it being about high school kids.The plot [if there really is one] and story is about a lady who is good at racing and is forced into it, and a guy who comes back from the military only to witness his brother die in a race. Sure that sounds kinda good but trust me it really is not all that great, but you can see were the potential was. The idea seems a little ok when you read it on paper or on a screen but the execution is really not grand at all and should have been handed over to Fast & the Furious guys for a part four. If that would have happened maybe it would have been at the very least ok. I don't enjoy speaking ill of any film because I really believe no one wants to make a bad movie but come on this movie needs help in a bad way. The story follows a man that comes home from the military just to find his younger brother involved in an illegal racing circuit working for their uncle who is a very shaky sketchy guy. At the same time a woman who is forced into racing becomes the uncles new prize when he wins her from Eddie, of course these two come together when his little brother dies and they go against the big bad uncle.Producer/co-writer Daniel Sadek seems to be proud of the final product but I have to believe that is just a front because I would not be happy with this final product. I guess most of the blame should fall on Sadek and Robert Foreman as they wrote this disaster, their story is almost non existent and the characters are not very dimensional at all. You would think that the story would be some what ok, I mean even the F & the F franchise tried a little harder. Director Andy Cheng it seems may want to stick to stunt work because this film is no were near great, although I liked his debut ""End Game"" so maybe he just didn't have the write script. Still the direction is not there and the final product suffers for it, he needs to care more about projects I guess.The acting is bad and I mean bad for this type of film, I say that because this was not a direct to DVD feature it actually had a theatrical run. As unbelievable as that it is you should see the performances in this movie, some are ok but most are bad. Eddie Griffin is one of the few to do an ok job in this film, but you can tell that he was in this for a pay check. Same can be said for Tim Matheson since he seems believable in this film as hard as that is to pull off. Every one else just seems to be on cruise control and maybe it is because they are there for a pay check, or maybe it is because the are not good you decide. I don't know, Angus Macfadyen as the uncle was ok and good in the villain role but Nadia Bjorlin should be ashamed with her performance. Nathan Phillips should feel the same way because I know he can do better then this right here.This is not a good movie in my mind and I do not really recommend it to any body unless you like cars or want to see a few good looking women.

Yep, Don Johnson's kid.  Although, if I had to put money on it, I'd say that at the very least Rod Stewart and/or James Van Der Beek were invited over for a wild night at the Johnson house.

He's possesses neither Vin Diesel's muscles nor Nicolas Cage's male pattern baldness, not to mention the fact that he can't act as well either.

1077762,A2PIX2K56IZZYX,B000QUU4R8,Jason W. Kaiser,"[2, 6]","Soooooooooo bad!!!! I give up!!! There has been 1, count 'em, 1 good car movie made in say the last 5-10 years. The Fast and the Furious was so good, and everything else has been so friggin' bad, and you can just add this piece of trash to the list. From the terrible 'Gone in 60 seconds, to both furious sequels (the 3rd being even worse then the 2nd, if you can believe that) Now we get 'Red Line' one of the worst acted movies I have EVER seen, and I've seen some duds. Now I know everyone is going to say, ""Why do you need good acting when it's about cars?"" It's simple people, good acting, leads to strong, credible characters which in turn leads to a great movie, no matter how simple the plot. Oh by the way, the plot in this is so simple and just dumb, I'll save you the details.The Fast and the Furious was exceptional because the acting and the writing were above average, so we cared alot about the characters, the story and the excellent ending. That's where this fluff fails and fails miserably. We get these cardboard characters who I swear to god are staring right at the cue-cards while delivering there 'lines' There is no emotion, no passion, no fun being had by any of the actors who you can tell where only in this for one thing and one thing only, a paycheck!!! The 2nd Fast and Furious was terrible, but I atleast was able to make it to the end by enjoying the awesome cars, not here, re-treads everywhere, seen them all before, in fact, several cars form the 1st Fast and Furious are here yet again, yawn........I think I will stop watching and hoping for another Fast and the Furious because I'm starting to think it can't be done. No matter how many explosions, car chases, hot women barely dressed, and patheticly pimped out cars, can save a movie from what it is, a brainless piece of crap, not even worthy of being enjoyed for 'eye candy' Also, Eddie Griffin need not be in any movie ever again, even though I somewhat enjoyed both Deuce movies (see, I do like terrible movies) He has shown time and time again that he can't act, and his comic timing is, well, lame. Our female leads in this movie, while nice to look at, couldn't act there way out of a cardbaord box, they need to just go back to the erotic thrillers they were making and stay out of main-stream movies.I complain alot about people being so negative when it comes to reviewing a movie. I try not to, but when a movie is this bad, it's difficult to be kind. I have no problem giving a movie that either bombed something fierce in the theatres or was critically dumped by every reviewer and critic a positive tag. But in doing so, there has to be some element I can brag about that was so well done that in made me forget about the many negatives, I was not able to do that with ""Red Line' You have seen everything here a zillion times before and will see again, probably real soon as I'm sure there is a Fast and the Furious 4' on the way.

Other than that, I nearly lost count of the number of errors. This film was like an extended rap video, minus the rappers and their bling bling. I thought Fast & The Furious 3 was as horrible as it could get. I was wrong.First of all, if you're going to gamble with a movie that has only one actor people can name (Eddie Griffin who plays ""Infamous"") then your script and plot better compensate for it. Redline missed this one by much more than a quarter mile and their solution was to fill scene after scene with half-nude women.Gone In 60 Seconds was a perfect example of having a good plot, nice cars and familiar faces playing characters. Plus, in that film at least there were numerous opponents the lead characters had to take on (i.e. the police, other car thieves, the murderous bad guy, etc.). In Redline the villainous Uncle is easier to laugh at than fear.And what half-brain decided to bring this expert race-car driver in towards the end for two scenes, who supposedly killed Natasha's father, and then eliminate him before the race is over? The level of suspense didn't increase at all because he wasn't identified early on as he should've been to up the pressure on the lead character.Then there's the cheesy fight sequences and shooting scenes. A little choreography never hurt anyone. All of The Bourne movies with Matt Damon have terrific scenes with both armed and unarmed combat and two were released prior to this film. Too bad the writer(s) didn't watch them.The predictability of each action sequence or major shift in the story is uncanny. I could watch this movie blindfolded and know what would happen next.A little music from the Top 40 is usually helpful too so it doesn't sound like we're listening to the tunes from a porn flick. This can lead to a little more income as well from selling the soundtrack.I realize the budget on this film was low just by watching the trailer. However, the writers failed to make up for that and just didn't put the heroes of the film through enough challenges or emotional situations that an audience could find a way to relate to.But then again, I'm glad I saw this film. If Hollywood is willing to lower its standards like this, then I know I truly stand a chance at becoming a successful actor and screenwriter.It doesn't surprise me that some wealthy real estate investor produced this film as a gift for his girlfriend - Nadia Bjorlin who plays Natasha - because no major production studio in Hollywood would allow such shallow and sloppy filmmaking with their dollars on the line.I walked away from this movie feeling sorry for all of those cars they destroyed and the B-list actors who may have postponed their next big roll by accepting such a pointless one.",1,Porn flicks have better plots,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,2814,"['Redline', 'one', 'positive', 'thing', 'Beautiful', 'machines', 'are', 'more', 'houses', 'Other', 'nearly', 'lost', 'count', 'number', 'errors', 'film', 'was', 'extended', 'rap', 'video', 'rappers', 'bling', 'bling', 'thought', 'Fast', 'Furious', '3', 'was', 'as', 'horrible', 'could', 'get', 'was', 'wrong.First', ""'re"", 'going', 'gamble', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'actor', 'people', 'can', 'name', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'who', 'Infamous', 'then', 'script', 'plot', 'better', 'compensate', 'Redline', 'missed', 'one', 'much', 'more', 'quarter', 'mile', 'solution', 'was', 'fill', 'scene', 'scene', 'half-nude', 'women.Gone', '60', 'Seconds', 'was', 'perfect', 'example', 'having', 'good', 'plot', 'nice', 'cars', 'familiar', 'playing', 'characters', 'film', 'least', 'were', 'numerous', 'opponents', 'lead', 'characters', 'had', 'take', 'i.e', 'police', 'other', 'car', 'thieves', 'murderous', 'bad', 'guy', 'etc.', 'Redline', 'villainous', 'Uncle', 'easier', 'laugh', 'fear.And', 'what', 'half-brain', 'decided', 'bring', 'expert', 'race-car', 'driver', 'towards', 'end', 'two', 'scenes', 'who', 'supposedly', 'killed', 'Natasha', 'father', 'then', 'eliminate', 'race', 'level', 'suspense', 'did', ""n't"", 'increase', 'was', ""n't"", 'identified', 'early', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pressure', 'lead', 'character.Then', 'cheesy', 'fight', 'sequences', 'shooting', 'scenes', 'little', 'choreography', 'never', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'have', 'terrific', 'scenes', 'armed', 'unarmed', 'combat', 'two', 'were', 'released', 'prior', 'film', 'Too', 'bad', 'writer', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'them.The', 'predictability', 'action', 'sequence', 'major', 'shift', 'story', 'uncanny', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'blindfolded', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next.A', 'little', 'music', 'Top', '40', 'usually', 'helpful', 'too', 'so', ""n't"", 'sound', ""'re"", 'listening', 'tunes', 'porn', 'flick', 'can', 'lead', 'little', 'more', 'income', 'as', 'well', 'selling', 'soundtrack.I', 'realize', 'budget', 'film', 'was', 'low', 'just', 'watching', 'trailer', 'However', 'writers', 'failed', 'make', 'up', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'heroes', 'film', 'enough', 'challenges', 'emotional', 'situations', 'audience', 'could', 'find', 'way', 'relate', 'to.But', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'willing', 'lower', 'standards', 'then', 'know', 'truly', 'stand', 'chance', 'becoming', 'successful', 'actor', 'screenwriter.It', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'wealthy', 'real', 'estate', 'investor', 'produced', 'film', 'gift', 'girlfriend', 'Nadia', 'Bjorlin', 'who', 'Natasha', 'major', 'production', 'studio', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'allow', 'such', 'shallow', 'sloppy', 'filmmaking', 'dollars', 'line.I', 'walked', 'away', 'movie', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'cars', 'destroyed', 'B-list', 'actors', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'postponed', 'next', 'big', 'roll', 'accepting', 'pointless', 'one']",N/A

I remember seeing ads for this movie back in 2007 prior to its release. Even back then, I was able to see that it was a poor man's ""Fast and Furious,"" but with some beautiful cars that are worth beyond anybody's salary. What I mostly remember from seeing TV spots and trailers was the fact that the biggest name of the bunch was Eddie Griffin. The rest of the cast I knew nothing of and the only other redeeming quality of the movie was the lovely Nadia Bjorlin. The rest of the movie had SO MANY problems that I can't even begin to describe. For example, gratuitous fight scenes, a contrived romantic subplot that didn't even seem remotely believable, forced comedic sequences, a lame villain played by an actor who you can tell didn't want to be there, also bad acting especially from the male lead. And guess what, that isn't even all of what was wrong with it.This movie had B-movie and straight to DVD written all over it. I guess some producers wanted to give the beautiful female lead some exposure, but she didn't do well in this movie either. Also, let's not forget the music from her in this movie. I read that Nadia Bjorlin is an actual singer and from what I saw, she didn't sing badly, but the songs sucked because it's obvious that they were about cars or love songs with car references thrown in there. I guess that was why it was given a theatrical release because it baffles me how it was even released in theaters at one point.Also, I regret ever buying this movie, even though I bought it at a closing Blockbuster store and it didn't cost me much money, but it cost me about an hour and a half that I would never get back.

It is not hard for us to imagine what the story of ""Redline"" would be like as ""Redline"" happens to be one of the working titles of ""The Fast and the Furious,"" but that is fine. Despite its silly and incredible story, I liked ""The Fast and the Furious"" series and the car race scenes (yes, I have seen all of them).Sadly ""Redline"" directed by stunt-turned-director Andy Cheng is not as enjoyable as any of them, not even the second ""FF"" which I consider the least successful of the three. Actually, ""Redline"" turned out much worse than I expected in more than one way (and I didn't expect very much).As other reviewers have rightly pointed out here, ""Redline"" has no coherent storyline, no charismatic actor (where is Vin Diesel?) or no great acting; instead it has so many stereotypical or unbelievable characters (Eddie Griffin's character and a singer/street car driver played by Nadia Bjorlin are easily the worst), but there is more to this terribly directed film.I thought there should be a great car action or two that would make up for the lack of reasonable story or decent acting. I was wrong. Yes, you will be seeing cool cars running wildly, but the film's ""action"" scenes, all poorly-shot and edited, always remain un-thrilling throughout and the results of the race are transparent from thousand miles away. Moreover, these illegal racers cause car crashes on the road involving innocent vehicles, and we are supposed to cheer for them.According to IMDb, a Porsche ($400,000 worth) was really used in a car crash scene. I should report this as trivia here. Actually this wasted car is the only thing I find really interesting in ""Redline.""",1,"""The Fast and the Furious"" It Is Not",1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,1778,"['OK', 'knew', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'anything', 'knew', 'not', 'contender', 'Oscar', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'not', 'hard', 'imagine', 'what', 'story', 'Redline', 'would', 'be', 'Redline', 'be', 'one', 'working', 'titles', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'fine', 'silly', 'incredible', 'story', 'liked', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'series', 'car', 'race', 'scenes', 'yes', 'have', 'seen', '.Sadly', 'Redline', 'directed', 'stunt-turned-director', 'Andy', 'Cheng', 'not', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'even', 'second', 'FF', 'consider', 'least', 'successful', 'three', 'Actually', 'Redline', 'turned', 'out', 'much', 'worse', 'expected', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'very', 'much', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'rightly', 'pointed', 'out', 'here', 'Redline', 'coherent', 'storyline', 'charismatic', 'actor', 'where', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'great', 'acting', 'instead', 'so', 'many', 'stereotypical', 'unbelievable', 'characters', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'character', 'singer/street', 'car', 'driver', 'played', 'Nadia', 'Bjorlin', 'are', 'easily', 'worst', 'more', 'terribly', 'directed', 'film.I', 'thought', 'there', 'should', 'be', 'great', 'car', 'action', 'two', 'would', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'reasonable', 'story', 'decent', 'acting', 'was', 'wrong', 'Yes', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'cool', 'cars', 'running', 'wildly', 'film', 'action', 'scenes', 'poorly-shot', 'edited', 'always', 'remain', 'un-thrilling', 'results', 'race', 'are', 'transparent', 'thousand', 'miles', 'away', 'Moreover', 'illegal', 'racers', 'cause', 'car', 'crashes', 'road', 'involving', 'innocent', 'vehicles', 'are', 'supposed', 'cheer', 'them.According', 'IMDb', 'Porsche', '400,000', 'worth', 'was', 'really', 'used', 'car', 'crash', 'scene', 'should', 'report', 'trivia', 'here', 'Actually', 'wasted', 'car', 'only', 'thing', 'find', 'really', 'interesting', 'Redline']",N/A
