However Part 2's good side is that it explores the deep changes within our main character Shu quite a bit and some tragic things do happen here and there. I really did appreciate Part 2 after finishing it. While watching the first few episodes of Part 2, it really did bug me how the story started to drop a bit. Overall I'd say the anime is in my top 5 favorites, I would give the series an 8.5/10 and I absolutely love the characters.

1651158,A21IFUGVOAMTRD,B00CU6WC94,DvtDude,"[4, 8]","Right off the bat I will say this, I don't think the second part of the series is nearly as good as the first part. That being said I didn't find it terrible. I understand why some people have issues with it but I don't think it's any reason to stray away from the series.With any show we are going to have characters make choices we don't want to make, and this happens a lot in the second part, but it makes sense. Every action that the characters make, it makes sense. You may be left in the dark for a bit on why they made it, but it all comes together in an almost suspense/mystery kind of way. Overall it worked.Enough on that. The show picks up right after the first series ends. Our main protagonist (Shu) has stopped the plight, for the moment. But of course everything goes to hell and bonds are tested and friendships are shattered. Characters undergo traumatic events and are sometimes changed for the worst. But as this all happens I found myself understanding why, sure I may have gotten upset over what was happening, but it made sense.As before the art and music is top notch, and the story threw me for a bit of loop at the end and I didn't actually expect the outcome that happened. If you already finished the first part I urge you to finish the second part. As I stated in the last review, take the show for what it is, when everything is said and done I found myself actually enjoying the show!",4,You've come this far!

I watched the video where the three creators talked about how they want to make original anime series and make them as good a production as a hollywood movie and have a moving story that you walk away from and feel something for the work and the characters....well they should probably learn the key to success is a HAPPY ENDING not this BS! I'm sorry but I get real sick and tired of feeling for the characters and getting involved in the story just to have it end the way it did. Not going to ruin the ending with any spoilers or anything but seriously WTF! I'm a little bit annoyed at how many anime series do this....suck you in, get you to feel for the characters and their plight and make you want them to have a happy ending and have things work out (best part about fiction is the happy ending IMHO as happy endings don't exist that often in the real world so at least in the fiction world they can/should give a little ray of hope to viewers who love the work and that's why MOST every successful movie/show has a happy ending and people like them because of that) By leaving this show off the way they did I feel robbed and just feel crappy about what happened to the main characters....great animation quality, unique story line and world they created but next time if you guys make a show...make it right and not this sad drama ending crap that most people don't want to relate to as it's painful and makes us want to just forget the show ever existed.",3,WTF!,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,1670,"['first', 'part', 'series', 'part', '1', 'was', 'awesome', 'beginning', 'second', 'part', 'part', '2', 'was', 'kinda', 'okay', 'weird', 'then', 'got', 'better', 'then', 'absolutely', 'RUINED', 'ending', 'watched', 'video', 'where', 'three', 'creators', 'talked', 'how', 'want', 'make', 'original', 'anime', 'series', 'make', 'good', 'production', 'hollywood', 'movie', 'have', 'moving', 'story', 'walk', 'away', 'feel', 'something', 'work', 'characters', '.well', 'should', 'probably', 'learn', 'key', 'success', 'HAPPY', 'ENDING', 'not', 'BS', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'get', 'real', 'sick', 'tired', 'feeling', 'characters', 'getting', 'involved', 'story', 'just', 'have', 'end', 'way', 'did', 'Not', 'going', 'ruin', 'ending', 'spoilers', 'anything', 'seriously', 'WTF', ""'m"", 'little', 'bit', 'annoyed', 'how', 'many', 'anime', 'series', 'do', '.suck', 'get', 'feel', 'characters', 'plight', 'make', 'want', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'have', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'best', 'part', 'fiction', 'happy', 'ending', 'IMHO', 'happy', 'endings', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'often', 'real', 'world', 'so', 'least', 'fiction', 'world', 'can/should', 'give', 'little', 'ray', 'hope', 'viewers', 'who', 'love', 'work', 'why', 'MOST', 'successful', 'movie/show', 'happy', 'ending', 'people', 'leaving', 'show', 'way', 'did', 'feel', 'robbed', 'just', 'feel', 'crappy', 'what', 'happened', 'main', 'characters', '.great', 'animation', 'quality', 'unique', 'story', 'line', 'world', 'created', 'next', 'time', 'guys', 'make', 'show', 'make', 'right', 'not', 'sad', 'drama', 'ending', 'crap', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'relate', 'painful', 'want', 'just', 'forget', 'show', 'ever', 'existed']",Guilty Crown: Complete Series - Part 2
1651167,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B00CU6WC94,Stephen M. Lerch,"[0, 1]","Guilty Crown set 1 ends with a NASTY cliffhanger. Like, Pickard being assimilated at the end of the season in Star Trek:TNG. OK, Guilty Crown isn't THAT good of a series, but if I didn't know better (or think a little more highly of FUNimation) I would say they did this on purpose. Maybe they really did this on purpose after all, since the second half isn't as strong as the first...In part 2, Shu continues to develop, becoming less of a wishy washy whiner and more into a much stronger person who is a lot more assertive.Don't forget that FUNimation still offers this show for streaming, so you can try the entire series before you buy if you like.I've copied a bit from my Guilty Crown part 1 LE because the audio and video portion of this set is just as good as the first set in these regardsVideo:I only watched the Blu Ray and spot checked the DVD. The Blu Ray is AVC encoded and was originally animated in 2011/2012, so was created digitally. The animation is smooth, the bit rate is high and there are no video blemishes to be seen. The DVD quality is MPEG video and looks really good for a DVD.There isn't anything amazing about the encode or the show itself that would lend this to being an Anime to showcase your awesome home theater system, but it's rock solid regardless.Audio:You have two options. You can watch in 5.1 Dolby TrueHD in English or Dolby TrueHD in stereo for the Japanese language track. The English track uses the 5.1 sound stage nicely, and doesn't overpower you with effects all over the place all the time. The acting is OK as well, so that's a plus.The Japanese language tracks seems to be a bit quieter than the English track (I've noticed a slight difference in other FUNi releases in the past as well). This is no problem, just turn up the volume. The stereo sound stage has really good separation as well, so there's another plus.Subtitles aren't 100% direct translations, but do a really good job of mimicking the intent of the original. Very good.Extras:Here are the video extras. There are no physical extras like there were in the LE of part 1Episode 15 commentaryEpisode 19 commentaryGuilty Crown 4-panel theaterEpisode previewsTextless opening songsTextless ending songsU.S. trailerTrailersThe extras are worth watching for sure. The episode previews weren't part of the original broadcast and are NOT shown while watching all the episodes in order. The commentaries, of you like English commentaries, are worth listening to. They aren't amazing, but fun.Over all-Guilty Crown is a little of a guilty pleasure. Parts are clich&eacute;, some parts are contrived and sometimes the main character can be an annoying pain. The story in part 2 isn't as strong as the first, bit still well animated and worth viewing.It won't blow you away, bit it's worth a viewing.Blu-Ray quality is a 5 as is the DVD.
