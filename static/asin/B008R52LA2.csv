1574417,A1ZI2W162HAVWD,B008R52LA2,David Pierce,"[0, 0]","I saw the entire 4 seasons both when it first aired and I own the collection. From the Lich assassin which reminds me of Dr. Phibes but he is my favorite character of the show to Stanley which I hated - his constant whine just got under my skin. The robot I didn't care for but fans of Hitchhiker may like him. The sex kitten I liked but found her to be a bit of a bully. I loved the sets, But mostly what I loved was the journeys. I got a kick out of the music. The show is not always pretty and it can be a bit redundant at times. But love it or hate it. I bet you haven't seen anything like it. But Red Dwarf has the same type of humor.",4,Lexx is a puzzle: at times good and at times bad: It takes some getting use to.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,639,"['saw', 'entire', '4', 'seasons', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'own', 'collection', 'Lich', 'assassin', 'Dr.', 'Phibes', 'favorite', 'character', 'show', 'Stanley', 'hated', 'constant', 'whine', 'just', 'got', 'skin', 'robot', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'fans', 'Hitchhiker', 'may', 'like', 'sex', 'kitten', 'liked', 'found', 'be', 'bit', 'bully', 'loved', 'sets', 'mostly', 'what', 'loved', 'was', 'journeys', 'got', 'kick', 'music', 'show', 'not', 'always', 'pretty', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'redundant', 'times', 'love', 'hate', 'bet', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'same', 'type', 'humor']",N/A
