The first one played like a good b horror movie while this one plays like a classic murder mystery, trust me that is a good thing. This series has always been an interesting one to me, even the truly horrible ones I find really entertaining. This one is really one of the most interesting werewolf  movies I have ever seen and I really mean that. Sure the acting is B movie bad but that means it is B movie cheese good, but the concept and lay out of this film is truly A level stuff. Honestly if you were to give a film from this franchise a chance it should be this one, go into it with low 2 no expectations and you will come truly entertained.The film is all about a group of randomly chosen people [or are they] that make a trip to a castle in Europe for its grand opening. Once there they are treated to an open house of a mysterious castle with something running around picking them off one by one. From here we are treated to something more in the vein of a good mystery film kinda like a ""who done it"" kind of thing more so then a horror movie. I think since it was made like this that is the reason why a lot of people enjoy this movie more so then the other films in this series. Once people start to disappear they realize that they are stuck in the castle because of a huge blizzard, and then not only are they lost inside a huge castle but they have to run around labyrinth like tunnels under the castle. When it comes down to the last 4 or 5 people this really turns into a ""who is the werewolf"" situation between the survivors. That who done it mentality really makes this film an interesting watch and actually keeps you interested all the way through.Director Neal Sundstrom really took something that would normally have been just another sequel and turned it into a very entertaining stand alone in the series. I really feel that Neal along side screen writers Clive Turner and Freddie Rowe saved this film from being horrible. Don't get me wrong the script is not an academy award winner in aspect [except maybe the idea of it] but it is still very interesting. I think it is the bad acting in this film that also adds a little something to it, bad acting in this type of film equals good cheese. Other then maybe Philip Davis every one in this film are so bad they are good, well maybe not that bad but still not award winning. Everything in this film just kinda has a likeable quality about it that even the cons are over shadowed by the pros.I highly recommend this film to any and every body out there, and if there was ever a film in this series you should see it is this one. The first film is also a really good flick in this franchise, I recommend a viewing of both, well just watch all of them.",5,INTERESTING IDEA AND STORY + CHEESE = 5 STARS,1223337600,"10 7, 2008",2008,2873,"['5THE', 'REBIRTHThis', 'got', 'be', 'most', 'entertaining', 'film', 'series', 'far', 'first', 'may', 'even', 'surpass', 'first', 'ways', 'first', 'one', 'played', 'good', 'b', 'horror', 'movie', 'one', 'classic', 'murder', 'mystery', 'trust', 'good', 'thing', 'series', 'always', 'been', 'interesting', 'one', 'even', 'truly', 'horrible', 'ones', 'find', 'really', 'entertaining', 'one', 'really', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'really', 'mean', 'Sure', 'acting', 'B', 'movie', 'bad', 'B', 'movie', 'cheese', 'good', 'concept', 'lay', 'out', 'film', 'truly', 'A', 'level', 'stuff', 'Honestly', 'were', 'give', 'film', 'franchise', 'chance', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'go', 'low', '2', 'expectations', 'will', 'come', 'truly', 'entertained.The', 'film', 'group', 'randomly', 'chosen', 'people', '[', 'are', ']', 'make', 'trip', 'castle', 'Europe', 'grand', 'opening', 'Once', 'are', 'treated', 'open', 'house', 'mysterious', 'castle', 'something', 'running', 'around', 'picking', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'here', 'are', 'treated', 'something', 'more', 'vein', 'good', 'mystery', 'film', 'kinda', 'who', 'done', 'kind', 'thing', 'more', 'so', 'then', 'horror', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'made', 'reason', 'why', 'lot', 'people', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'more', 'so', 'then', 'other', 'films', 'series', 'Once', 'people', 'start', 'disappear', 'realize', 'are', 'stuck', 'castle', 'huge', 'blizzard', 'then', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'lost', 'huge', 'castle', 'have', 'run', 'around', 'labyrinth', 'tunnels', 'castle', 'When', 'down', 'last', '4', '5', 'people', 'really', 'who', 'werewolf', 'situation', 'survivors', 'who', 'done', 'mentality', 'really', 'film', 'interesting', 'watch', 'actually', 'keeps', 'interested', 'way', 'through.Director', 'Neal', 'Sundstrom', 'really', 'took', 'something', 'would', 'normally', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'sequel', 'turned', 'very', 'entertaining', 'stand', 'alone', 'series', 'really', 'feel', 'Neal', 'side', 'screen', 'writers', 'Clive', 'Turner', 'Freddie', 'Rowe', 'saved', 'film', 'being', 'horrible', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'script', 'not', 'academy', 'award', 'winner', 'aspect', '[', 'maybe', 'idea', 'still', 'very', 'interesting', 'think', 'bad', 'acting', 'film', 'also', 'little', 'something', 'bad', 'acting', 'type', 'film', 'equals', 'good', 'cheese', 'Other', 'then', 'maybe', 'Philip', 'Davis', 'one', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'are', 'good', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'bad', 'still', 'not', 'award', 'winning', 'Everything', 'film', 'just', 'kinda', 'likeable', 'quality', 'even', 'cons', 'are', 'shadowed', 'pros.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'body', 'there', 'was', 'ever', 'film', 'series', 'should', 'see', 'one', 'first', 'film', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'flick', 'franchise', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'well', 'just', 'watch']",Howling V: The Rebirth / Howling VI: The Freaks

A group of people are gathered together at a castle in Budapest. A werewolf picks them off one by one. I kept on guessing until in the final half hour I was pretty sure who it was and I was correct. I will not spoil it for you. For what was a name brand off the shelf rental and now great on DVD this is really suspenseful. All the group, each of them has a gimmick. A surprisngly intelligient horror film.The Howling 6 The Freaks is just that- a freak show. I hadn't seen it before. A vampire is also thrown in.It's too bad I'd imagine only diehard horror fans have probably seen this/ will see it as it is one of the most suspensful movies I have seen in my life, Howling 5 that is. I've seen this series called mediocre by critics, they're not. I grew up on Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween and they were called mediocre, too.

I loved the first one, hated the second one, and thought the third one was weirder than hell. I saw this DVD for sale for real cheap so I picked it up. I wasn't expecting much since Howling II &amp; III weren't very good (I still haven't seen IV), and I was actually surprised by Howling V. Of course its lower budget and it has its downfalls, but I really enjoyed it. I really liked the the idea of people being trapped inside a castle because of a ragging blizzard only to be terrorized by a werewolf. I only wished they showed the werewolf a little more, because of the few shots it had, it looked pretty cool. Howling V, since it was made in Europe, has a real unique atmosphere to it. Howling VI on the other hand, I didn't like so well. Even compared to the other sequels, this one fells a lot cheaper made. The idea is intersting, but it just plods along. The werewolf in this one looks more like big foot than a lycanthrope. Already I have watched Howling V three times and VI only once. What I want to know is why didn't Artisan throw Howling IV on this DVD as well? I mean they fit V &amp; VI onto one side of the DVD so they could have put IV on the other? Artisan does own the rights to Howling IV, so this makes me wonder if they are ever goint to release it. Overall this disc was worth the ten bucks I spent. I really like when movie companies put two movies on a disc, and Artisan is doing it a lot latly. I only wish that Artisan would remaster these movies. MGM does, why not Artisan.

764534,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B0000ALPFI,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[0, 0]","HOWLING movies are especially reviled amongst horror afficianados for their unremitting awfulness. That's a fancy way of saying they suck.  And by and large it is true. Part II is one of the best unintentional comedies ever filmed bar none, Part III is often included on ""worst ever"" film lists, and Part VII actually has the lowest rating ever recorded on IMDB for a movie - one point five. So most people won't expect much from ""The Rebirth."" They'd be wrong, however. This flick, while hardly a masterpiece and riddled with flaws of every description, is actually not half bad.Basically the story is this: a dozen tourists staying in Budapest get invited by the mysterious Count Istvan to visit a castle in a remote area of Hungary which hasn't been open to the public since its owners, a wealthy noble family, killed themselves (or were murdered) exactly 500 years ago that night. Upon arrival a blizzard socks them in, and soon guests begin to go missing one by one, even as the Count explains some - but not all - of the castle's dark history, which includes whispers about the Devil and rumors of a pack of werewolves that allegedly roamed the forest in ancient times. Paranoia and suspicion grow as the fast-dwindling number of survivors realize they have to unearth what seems to be a killer in their midst. But is the killer a human agent, an animal...or something much worse? And why did he, she, or it go to such lengths to trap these particular people here like lambs in a slaughter pen? The mystery's worth solving...provided anyone lives long enough to solve it.REBIRTH's formula is an old and familiar one. Take your classic TEN LITTLE INDIANS scenario - buncha folks stuck in a creepy place getting offed one by one - mash it up with THE BEAST MUST DIE, and presto! You have yet another HOWLING movie. And let's face it, REBIRTH has a lot, and I do mean a LOT, of problems. Like all horror movies the acting and writing both are terribly inconsistent, going from clever and witty one moment to God-awful the next. Ditto the editing, camerawork and scene transitions. The plot, simple as it is, is not so much riddled with holes as a giant hole itself, around which exists a thin rim of story. (Honestly, the more Count Istvan tries to explain, the less things made any kind of sense.) And the behavior of the characters is often so mindl-bogglingly stupid that it's as if they are actually doing a kind of tutorial on What Not To Do In A Horror Flick (""Let's keep going into the labyrinth beneath the castle!"") Finally, there is precious little in the way of werewolves in this movie - so much so that if you simply took them out of the equation entirely you might arguably have had a creepier film, simply by adding to the storyline's deliberate ambiguity.Balancing this to some extent is the fact that some real effort is made here. The budget is low and the cast obscure, but some of them aren't half-bad actors, the musical score is kind of cool, and a few scenes actually achieve strong tension and mild frights, not to mention the occasional (intentional) laugh. Though the characters are stock (athlete, bimbo female, professor, ice queen doctor, elegant actress, playboy, mysterious Count, etc., etc.), they are given sufficient time before the slaughter begins to manifest some personality. What's more, borrowing a page from ALIEN, the story does a lot of baiting and switching in the early going about who the actual ""star"" is going to be, with the result that you begin to suspect - rightly - that no one is actually safe in the story (as opposed to, say, an F-13 film, where 5 minutes in you know precisely who will live and who is machete-bait). Plus, continuing the tradition laid down in Part II of gratuitous but welcome nudity, we get a terrific shot of the lovely Elizabeth Sh&eacute; getting into and out of a hot tub stark naked, a scene I still find very appealing despite the existence of the Internet and its limitless abyss of porn. And the ending of the movie is surprisingly well done if a touch abrupt, relying on a lot of misdirection to deliver the final twist.So there ya have it. This is not a great or even a good movie; but it's surprisingly not-bad, and it has just enough redeeming moments to entertain you for 90 minutes if you happen to be in the right mood. If that's not exactly a ringing endorsement, all I can say is, ""Forget it, Count Istvan -  it's Howlingtown.""",4,Shockingly Not Bad,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,4423,"['HOWLING', 'movies', 'are', 'especially', 'reviled', 'amongst', 'horror', 'afficianados', 'unremitting', 'awfulness', 'fancy', 'way', 'saying', 'suck', 'large', 'true', 'Part', 'II', 'one', 'best', 'unintentional', 'comedies', 'ever', 'filmed', 'bar', 'none', 'Part', 'III', 'often', 'included', 'worst', 'ever', 'film', 'lists', 'Part', 'VII', 'actually', 'lowest', 'rating', 'ever', 'recorded', 'IMDB', 'movie', 'one', 'point', 'five', 'most', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'Rebirth', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'however', 'flick', 'hardly', 'masterpiece', 'riddled', 'flaws', 'description', 'actually', 'not', 'half', 'bad.Basically', 'story', 'dozen', 'tourists', 'staying', 'Budapest', 'get', 'invited', 'mysterious', 'Count', 'Istvan', 'visit', 'castle', 'remote', 'area', 'Hungary', ""n't"", 'been', 'open', 'public', 'owners', 'wealthy', 'noble', 'family', 'killed', 'were', 'murdered', 'exactly', '500', 'years', 'ago', 'night', 'arrival', 'blizzard', 'soon', 'guests', 'begin', 'go', 'missing', 'one', 'one', 'even', 'Count', 'not', 'castle', 'dark', 'history', 'whispers', 'Devil', 'rumors', 'pack', 'werewolves', 'allegedly', 'roamed', 'forest', 'ancient', 'times', 'Paranoia', 'suspicion', 'grow', 'fast-dwindling', 'number', 'survivors', 'realize', 'have', 'unearth', 'what', 'be', 'killer', 'midst', 'killer', 'human', 'agent', 'animal', 'something', 'much', 'worse', 'why', 'did', 'go', 'such', 'lengths', 'trap', 'particular', 'people', 'here', 'lambs', 'slaughter', 'pen', 'mystery', 'worth', 'solving', 'provided', 'anyone', 'long', 'enough', 'solve', 'it.REBIRTH', 'formula', 'old', 'familiar', 'one', 'Take', 'classic', 'TEN', 'LITTLE', 'INDIANS', 'scenario', 'buncha', 'folks', 'stuck', 'creepy', 'place', 'getting', 'one', 'one', 'mash', 'up', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'MUST', 'DIE', 'presto', 'have', 'yet', 'HOWLING', 'movie', 'let', 'face', 'REBIRTH', 'lot', 'do', 'mean', 'LOT', 'problems', 'horror', 'movies', 'acting', 'writing', 'are', 'terribly', 'inconsistent', 'going', 'clever', 'witty', 'one', 'moment', 'God-awful', 'next', 'Ditto', 'editing', 'camerawork', 'scene', 'transitions', 'plot', 'simple', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'riddled', 'holes', 'giant', 'hole', 'thin', 'rim', 'story', 'Honestly', 'more', 'Count', 'Istvan', 'explain', 'less', 'things', 'made', 'kind', 'sense', 'behavior', 'characters', 'often', 'so', 'mindl-bogglingly', 'stupid', 'are', 'actually', 'doing', 'kind', 'tutorial', 'What', 'Not', 'Do', 'A', 'Horror', 'Flick', 'Let', 'keep', 'going', 'labyrinth', 'beneath', 'castle', 'Finally', 'precious', 'little', 'way', 'werewolves', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'simply', 'took', 'equation', 'entirely', 'might', 'arguably', 'have', 'had', 'creepier', 'film', 'simply', 'adding', 'storyline', 'deliberate', 'ambiguity.Balancing', 'extent', 'fact', 'real', 'effort', 'made', 'here', 'budget', 'low', 'cast', 'obscure', 'are', ""n't"", 'half-bad', 'actors', 'musical', 'score', 'kind', 'cool', 'few', 'scenes', 'actually', 'achieve', 'strong', 'tension', 'mild', 'frights', 'not', 'mention', 'occasional', 'intentional', 'laugh', 'characters', 'are', 'stock', 'athlete', 'bimbo', 'female', 'professor', 'ice', 'queen', 'doctor', 'elegant', 'actress', 'playboy', 'mysterious', 'Count', 'etc.', 'etc', 'are', 'given', 'sufficient', 'time', 'slaughter', 'manifest', 'personality', 'What', 'more', 'borrowing', 'page', 'ALIEN', 'story', 'lot', 'baiting', 'switching', 'early', 'going', 'who', 'actual', 'star', 'going', 'be', 'result', 'begin', 'suspect', 'rightly', 'one', 'actually', 'safe', 'story', 'opposed', 'say', 'F-13', 'film', 'where', '5', 'minutes', 'know', 'precisely', 'who', 'will', 'live', 'who', 'machete-bait', 'continuing', 'tradition', 'laid', 'down', 'Part', 'II', 'gratuitous', 'welcome', 'nudity', 'get', 'terrific', 'shot', 'lovely', 'Elizabeth', 'Sh', 'eacute', 'getting', 'hot', 'tub', 'stark', 'naked', 'scene', 'still', 'find', 'very', 'appealing', 'existence', 'Internet', 'limitless', 'abyss', 'porn', 'ending', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'done', 'touch', 'abrupt', 'relying', 'lot', 'misdirection', 'deliver', 'final', 'twist.So', 'ya', 'have', 'not', 'great', 'even', 'good', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'not-bad', 'just', 'enough', 'redeeming', 'moments', 'entertain', '90', 'minutes', 'happen', 'be', 'right', 'mood', 'not', 'exactly', 'ringing', 'endorsement', 'can', 'say', 'Forget', 'Count', 'Istvan', 'Howlingtown']",Howling V: The Rebirth / Howling VI: The Freaks

So before you run out the door just hearing the words Howling part...., bear with me.The movie opens up with a really cool baby cradle rocking, and then jumps ahead to a pretty depressing dinner scene, and then jumps forward yet again to the basic plot. A group of people have been called together to stay a week at a castle that has been boarded up for 500 years. They all are itching at the bits to see this thing but have no idea why they were chosen; most of them believe they won the honor somehow. Once there in the hotel about to be transported, some of them see they know another person in the group, but for the most part they're all strangers about to embark on a very strange vacation. The ""Count"" escorts them on a bus, to where they narrowly miss hitting some 'strange dog' on the road. Once at the castle, in it's old and candle lit glory, the fun begins. Locked in from a storm blowing fiercely outside, they slowly find people are dead or have disappeared. The cool castle even has a secret chamber/tunnel, which sets up some truly unnerving sequences when they go hunting for missing persons.At first they are believing the deaths are from sort of wild animal that somehow got trapped in the castle and is starving to death. When they begin exploring the tunnels and finding bodies however, one person says ""Werewolf"" before breathing their final breath. Knowing it is odd that anyone would use this as their last dying word, they're even more disturbed. They also discover other creepy instances, such as that someone has been rubbing off the chalk marks on the wall letting them get back. The count can't wait to tell them that he has brought them all to the castle for one reason, and that he believes one of them is the last descendant werewolf. Most don't believe him, while others try to figure out who is who before it's too late.Where many will complain is the lack of the furry. The werewolf is shown with small glimpses here and there but never outright, and is also not given a whole lot of screen time. The howling flicks don't get a big budget, so personally I think they did the right thing here. Showing a werewolf that's cheesy in all it's glory is less appealing that 'hints' that look convincing yet freaky. This directional technique, forced my $$$, actually helped the film retain a certain level of eeriness. Many times the death is scene through another character peeking in, or else in close ups of the persons face before they're slaughtered.I really dug the castle. It was huge, gothic looking, and claustrophobic. The insides were lit with candle light and the rooms were fantastic. I hadn't seen a werewolf flick in this type of setting only, it works well. The whole gothic stone thing matches and suits the mood to a T.Making this movie must have been a pretty depressing experience, as it was the final role for many of the actors. Victoria Catlin, who played the good doctor, also starred in Ghoulies, Mutants on the bounty, and Maniac Cop, but stopped here. The same can be said for Stephanie Faulkner. They really didn't do that bad of a job though. Some of the other actors went on to do very well. Victoria Catlin convinced me of her personality and did an admirable thing with the material she was given.The character of Mary Lou, played by Elisabeth Sh&eacute;, was laughable. She was over the top stupid and it showed but not in a tacky way. This helped inject a mild amusement in the viewing experience. The Howling 5 isn't a comedy but you can't help but dig some of the characters eventually for their quirks alone. Mary Ann Catrin Stavin, who was Miss World 1977 - she really is good on the eyes, was the gorgeous bombshell in House - stars as Anna. There's something about her personality that, while not the best actress ever, comes through and endears her to me. Ben Cole as David is hit and miss. I dug his serious appeal but he is too stiff and awkward. Richard, who is the sleaze bag man on the prowl to get laid, is played pretty well by William Shockley. Phillip Davis is over the top and rightfully so as the Count, making his character seem too much, but it actually works.There are some way the Howling 5 fails, primarily the pace. Sometimes it's creeps along a little too slow. Also, some more gore and shown violence instead of implied would have helped the film instead of hurting it slightly. I didn't guess the ending, but I also didn't think too hard about it, but they could have been less obvious when you come around to it.Overall it's a movie worth watching, and that's hard to say with a straight face when referring to the howling sequels. I have no wish to revisit six and seven, so it is unlikely there will be a review of those. Consider it ended here for now, but at least it ended well, even though the journey to get here got a bit perilous at times.",3,Not that bad,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,5302,"['What', ""'m"", 'say',

764539,A2ONX15N6TWDR,B0000ALPFI,Vincenzo L.,"[1, 1]","This is a review of BOTH movies, so please bear with me...HOWLING V - The Rebirth.After being shuttered for over 500 years following a horrific, intentionally staged family massacre, a mysterious Hungarian castle opens its doors with the apparent intention of attracting tourist business. A diverse group of people from different parts of the globe is assembled at the eerie dwelling after having been chosen when they applied for a visa. But once they arrive some begin to wonder if there is more going on than meets the eye. First they hear terrible stories about savage packs of wolves that used to roam the area and then people begin to disappear, only some of whom are found later with their throats torn out. It soon becomes clear that a murderer is among them, and the culprit may only partially be human.However, as the story progresses and the ultimate truth is revealed, ties between predator, prey and the very castle itself will be fatally exposed.  This movie is a well done attempt to mimic another classic werewolf mystery film THE BEAST MUST DIE.  We are lead down a well crafted trail of mystery and horror as the viewer attempts to figure out who the werewolf is in this slasher/mystery film.  One by one the 'guests' of a party at an isolated castle are dismembered by an unknown force that leaves the viewer wanting more.  The story is well told, the special effects are good, and the pace is quick and enjoyable.  Without giving anything away, I will admit that I was surprised at who the villainous lycanthrope was.If you like werewolf and/or whodunnit films, this one is twice the guilty pleasure.  For the price of this film alone, it was worth the purchase... but, it comes with a second disc...HOWLING VI - The Freaks.THE HOWLING VI, released right under the heels of THE HOWLING parts four and five, revolves around a carnival of sideshow freaks commanded by a vampire named Harker, who is played by British actor Bruce Martyn Payne.  The vampire is this film is mostly nocturnal, and sports long blonde hair, with a nassaly, sneering British accent.  He is hardly convincing and is barely tolerable as the central menace, but he is nonetheless depicted as a sinister creature of sorts.Actor Brandon Hughes (TO DIE FOR) plays the film's new werewolf, who is first conceived as the evil monster responsible for slaying the inhabitants of a small American town.  In a ridiculous scene, he is captured by the vampire and displayed in his circus of freaks as an oddity of natures 'dark side'.  Naturally the premise leads to the ultimate battle in which the werewolf becomes the hero and slays the vampire by driving a metal spike into his throat (whoops - spoiler).  To add excitement to this otherwise dull film, the werewolf dramatically leaps onto a curtain and shreds it with his claws, allowing the sun to burst through the window and onto the vampire.  The sun's rays literally roasts the vampire to a pile of black ashes.Of course, vampire film buffs will know that this scene is completely inspired by the climactic final battle in HORROR OF DRACULA.  But what is puzzling is how the werewolf, a savage and bloodthirsty beast void of human emotions, thought and temperament, can actually think and reason clearly enough to be able to rip some curtains apart in order to allow the sun's rays to enter the room?THE HOWLING VI is far removed from the original concept created way back in 1981 with the original HOWLING film.  Somehow, the series has lost its impact along the way, the novelty of adding a vampire into the series was simply a commercial device to increase its video sales.  This particular film in the series was never released theatrically, and for that we can all be grateful.",4,"Two Films for the price of one, but only one is worth the having.",1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,3723,"['review', 'BOTH', 'movies', 'please', 'bear', 'HOWLING', 'V', 'Rebirth.After', 'being', 'shuttered', '500', 'years', 'following', 'horrific', 'intentionally', 'staged', 'family', 'massacre', 'mysterious', 'Hungarian', 'castle', 'doors', 'apparent', 'intention', 'attracting', 'tourist', 'business', 'diverse', 'group', 'people', 'different', 'parts', 'globe', 'assembled', 'eerie', 'dwelling', 'having', 'been', 'chosen', 'when', 'applied', 'visa', 'once', 'arrive', 'begin', 'wonder', 'more', 'going', 'meets', 'eye', 'First', 'hear', 'terrible', 'stories', 'savage', 'packs', 'wolves', 'used', 'roam', 'area', 'then', 'people', 'begin', 'disappear', 'only', 'whom', 'are', 'found', 'later', 'throats', 'torn', 'out', 'soon', 'clear', 'murderer', 'culprit', 'may', 'only', 'partially', 'be', 'human.However', 'story', 'ultimate', 'truth', 'revealed', 'ties', 'predator', 'prey', 'very', 'castle', 'will', 'be', 'fatally', 'exposed', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'attempt', 'mimic', 'classic', 'werewolf', 'mystery', 'film', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'MUST', 'DIE', 'are', 'lead', 'well', 'crafted', 'trail', 'mystery', 'horror', 'viewer', 'attempts', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'werewolf', 'slasher/mystery', 'film', 'One', 'one', ""'guests"", 'party', 'isolated', 'castle', 'are', 'dismembered', 'unknown', 'force', 'viewer', 'wanting', 'more', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'pace', 'quick', 'enjoyable', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'surprised', 'who', 'villainous', 'lycanthrope', 'like', 'werewolf', 'and/or', 'whodunnit', 'films', 'one', 'twice', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'price', 'film', 'alone', 'was', 'worth', 'purchase', 'second', 'disc', 'HOWLING', 'VI', 'Freaks.THE', 'HOWLING', 'VI', 'released', 'right', 'heels', 'THE', 'HOWLING', 'parts', 'four', 'five', 'carnival', 'sideshow', 'freaks', 'commanded', 'vampire', 'named', 'Harker', 'who', 'played', 'British', 'actor', 'Bruce', 'Martyn', 'Payne', 'vampire', 'film', 'mostly', 'nocturnal', 'sports', 'long', 'blonde', 'hair', 'nassaly', 'sneering', 'British', 'accent', 'hardly', 'convincing', 'barely', 'tolerable', 'central', 'menace', 'nonetheless', 'depicted', 'sinister', 'creature', 'sorts.Actor', 'Brandon', 'Hughes', 'TO', 'DIE', 'FOR', 'film', 'new', 'werewolf', 'who', 'first', 'conceived', 'evil', 'monster', 'responsible', 'slaying', 'inhabitants', 'small', 'American', 'town', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'captured', 'vampire', 'displayed', 'circus', 'freaks', 'oddity', 'natures', ""'dark"", 'side', 'Naturally', 'premise', 'ultimate', 'battle', 'werewolf', 'hero', 'vampire', 'driving', 'metal', 'spike', 'throat', 'whoops', 'spoiler', 'add', 'excitement', 'otherwise', 'dull', 'film', 'werewolf', 'dramatically', 'curtain', 'claws', 'allowing', 'sun', 'burst', 'window', 'vampire', 'sun', 'rays', 'literally', 'vampire', 'pile', 'black', 'ashes.Of', 'course', 'vampire', 'film', 'buffs', 'will', 'know', 'scene', 'completely', 'inspired', 'climactic', 'final', 'battle', 'HORROR', 'OF', 'DRACULA', 'what', 'puzzling', 'how', 'werewolf', 'savage', 'bloodthirsty', 'beast', 'void', 'human', 'emotions', 'thought', 'temperament', 'can', 'actually', 'think', 'reason', 'clearly', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'rip', 'curtains', 'apart', 'order', 'allow', 'sun', 'rays', 'enter', 'room', 'HOWLING', 'VI', 'far', 'removed', 'original', 'concept', 'created', 'way', 'back', '1981', 'original', 'HOWLING', 'film', 'Somehow', 'series', 'lost', 'impact', 'way', 'novelty', 'adding', 'vampire', 'series', 'was', 'simply', 'commercial', 'device', 'increase', 'video', 'sales', 'particular', 'film', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'theatrically', 'can', 'be', 'grateful']",Howling V: The Rebirth / Howling VI: The Freaks
764540,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0000ALPFI,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Despite the lousy cover of this DVD double feature, ""Howling V: The Rebirth"" and ""Howling VI: The Freaks"" are two of the better sequels in this werewolf non-series that currently has eight entries, all self-contained stories.There are zero extras, but both films look fine (this refers to Timeless Media Group DVD).HOWLING V: THE REBIRTH (1989, 96 minutes)Shot in an actual Hungarian castle, the plot is borrowed from ""The Beast Must Die"" (1974) wherein a group of people spend the night in a huge European estate while one of the party, a werewolf, systematically butchers the guests. It's basically a whodunit a la Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None."" It's also reminiscent of the underrated ""Devil's Nightmare"" aka ""The Devil Walks at Midnight"" (1971), albeit not as good.Still, it comes close, and although the werewolf is barely seen I found this a solid low-budget mystery flick with a werewolf. Besides, Elizabeth Sh&eacute; (Marylou) has an exceptional scene and there's a great gothic score. But gorehounds who want to see loads of bloody werewolf action should pass (there's a little, but not enough to appease modern gorehounds).GRADE: B-HOWLING VI: THE FREAKS (1991, 102 minutes)A Brit named Ian (Brendan Hughes) drifts into a Southwestern town around the same time as a carnival freak show. He picks up work with a pastor and stays at his house where his cute daughter, Elizabeth (Michele Matheson), takes interest. Harker (Bruce Payne), the darkly man who owns the freak show, may be more than what he appears.This one is too dramatic and slow for those with ADHD and the werewolf's face looks more like a member of Twisted Sister than a werewolf, although the way the beast walks on canine legs is notable. In any case, ""Howling VI"" delivers. In fact, I think it's the best of the sequels, followed by IV and V, although I haven't yet seen 1995's ""The Howling: New Moon Rising [VHS]"" (VII) or 2011's ""The Howling Reborn"" (VIII).What makes ""Howling VI"" stand out is its focus on characters. The casting is excellent and all the characters are well fleshed-out for a 102-minute micro-budget horror flick. For instance, Ian clearly has a dark secret, but it's also obvious that he's a quality soul. Elizabeth is innocent to the ways of the world but she instinctively senses goodness in Ian, as does the ""alligator boy."" Harker, by contrast, possesses a sinister edge despite his great charisma. Speaking of which, Bruce Payne is outstanding here.GRADE: B+FINAL WORD: In view of the DVD cover, I was expecting two crappy sequels and instead got two quality low-budget werewolf flicks.
