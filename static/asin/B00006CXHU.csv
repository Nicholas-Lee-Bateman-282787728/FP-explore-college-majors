711838,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00006CXHU,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 3]","'Ice Age' deserves to be called the classic it is.  With a quirky, mismatched group of sojourners, including Manfred the Mammoth (Ray Romano), Sid the silly Sloth (John Leguizamo), and Diego, the savvy, saber-toothed tiger (Denis Leary), the elements are all in place for some funny, pre-historic fun.  When Diego's pack of tigers discover the cavemen have a baby child, they plot to avenge the predator humans by constructing a kidnapping.  It first goes awry, but the baby is sent down the river, where he is saved by the goofy Sid, who brings the reluctant Manfred into the fold of his plan to return the little bugger.  Diego has to earn his credibility with his pack by retrieving the child, but he ends up in the entourage of our Cenozoic Era misfits.  Will he betray his pack or his new found friends?'Ice Age' has good, character laughs and some fun adventure with a polar slide that is hard to beat.  The sight gags work well, too.  Clocking in before an hour and a half doesn't hurt, either, as Hollywood learns that they don't have to always give us extraneous director's cuts that are tiresome at best.  Even the gratuitous ancestor of the squirrel is hysterical for his ""nutty"" adventures that only have a slight connection to the plot.",4,Cool Laughs,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,1249,"[""'Ice"", 'Age', 'deserves', 'be', 'called', 'classic', 'quirky', 'mismatched', 'group', 'sojourners', 'including', 'Manfred', 'Mammoth', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'Sid', 'silly', 'Sloth', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Diego', 'savvy', 'saber-toothed', 'tiger', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'elements', 'are', 'place', 'funny', 'pre-historic', 'fun', 'When', 'Diego', 'pack', 'tigers', 'discover', 'cavemen', 'have', 'baby', 'child', 'plot', 'avenge', 'predator', 'humans', 'constructing', 'kidnapping', 'first', 'awry', 'baby', 'sent', 'river', 'where', 'saved', 'goofy', 'Sid', 'who', 'reluctant', 'Manfred', 'fold', 'plan', 'return', 'little', 'bugger', 'Diego', 'earn', 'credibility', 'pack', 'retrieving', 'child', 'up', 'entourage', 'Cenozoic', 'Era', 'misfits', 'Will', 'betray', 'pack', 'new', 'found', 'friends', 'Age', 'good', 'character', 'laughs', 'fun', 'adventure', 'polar', 'slide', 'hard', 'beat', 'sight', 'gags', 'work', 'well', 'too', 'Clocking', 'hour', 'half', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either', 'Hollywood', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'always', 'give', 'extraneous', 'director', 'cuts', 'are', 'tiresome', 'best', 'Even', 'gratuitous', 'ancestor', 'squirrel', 'hysterical', 'nutty', 'only', 'have', 'slight', 'connection', 'plot']",N/A

But it is a good movie to sit down with the whole family to watch. There's little violence and no sexual content. The animation is a little cartoony--but the animators aren't shooting for realistic here, they are looking for more of a 'Shrek' type look. It has its charm. It does have a strong cast. I'd never have pictured Ray Romano as a mammoth, but his dead pan delivery does fit well with the personality of a gigantic mammoth. Dennis Leary plays the saber-tooth tiger, but holding Leary back to a PG rating takes away from his appeal. Still, he does a fairly good job with what he has, and the funniest moments in the movie come from his interaction with John Leguizamo, who is brilliant as the sloth. Cedric the Entertainer, Jack Black, and Gorin Visjnic (casting him as the leader of the tigers was a stroke of genius, I wish there had been more scenes featuring him) have small supporting roles. The dvd contains all kinds of extras, but it is the short animation 'Bunny' that really makes this dvd worth buying (and the cave painting scene in the movie). You can see the animators genius there.

The film tells the story of a lonely mammoth named Manfred.  With the rest of civilization (or animal-kind) heading south, Manfred finds himself working against nature (as is his nature) until he meets an obnoxious creature named Sid who, through a series of events, changes Manfred's course.  They soon encounter a dying human mother who has just been attached (along with her village) by some dastardly saber-toothed tigers.  Before she expires, this human hands off her child to the unlikely pair who then make it their goal to return the child to his tribe.  Before they can make any progress, they are accosted by Diego, one of the saber-toothed tigers.  Scheming to get the child for himself (and his pack) he pretends to have the child's best interest at heart, and accompanies Manfred and Sid on their journey to find the humans.That's pretty much the movie in a nutshell.What I loved so much about this film is that it doesn't beat you over with sentiment and poignancy, but it subtly wraps those important themes around endless scenes of warm hearted comedy.  The film is just really, really funny.  The sequences never seem to be lacking, whether it be physical comedy or witty intellect or even slapstick child-like comedy.  The film perfectly fuses the three variations of comedic delivery into a nicely balanced feature film.And who doesn't think that Scrat is like the best animated character of all time?In the end I am more than pleased with this film.  It is not the best animated film of all time, but it deserves more respect than I think it garners.  It is nice to see that more animated films are carrying weightier messages and delivering strongly, and I applaud Pixar for taking the lead in adding depth to a genre that is all too often disregarded as `childsplay' (I am at fault of this very act of blasphemy in the past), but we don't want to forget that the heart of the animated feature lies in the smile plastered on our son or daughter's face, and it is films like `Ice Age' that bring those smiles in spades.",5,One delicious nut...,1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,2466,"['Friendship', 'loyalty', 'danger', 'adventure', 'love', 'family', 'are', 'just', 'many', 'themes', 'presented', 'delightful', 'form', 'crowd', 'pleasing', 'animated', 'feature', 'staring', 'prehistoric', 'creatures.With', 'vocal', 'talents', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'awkward', 'sloth', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'minor', 'moments', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Ice', 'Age', 'comedic', 'talent', 'back', 'up', 'premise', 'film', 'story', 'lonely', 'mammoth', 'named', 'Manfred', 'rest', 'civilization', 'animal-kind', 'heading', 'south', 'Manfred', 'working', 'nature', 'nature', 'obnoxious', 'creature', 'named', 'Sid', 'who', 'series', 'events', 'changes', 'Manfred', 'course', 'soon', 'encounter', 'dying', 'human', 'mother', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'attached', 'village', 'dastardly', 'saber-toothed', 'tigers', 'human', 'child', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'who', 'then', 'make', 'goal', 'return', 'child', 'tribe', 'can', 'make', 'progress', 'are', 'accosted', 'Diego', 'one', 'saber-toothed', 'tigers', 'Scheming', 'get', 'child', 'pack', 'have', 'child', 'best', 'interest', 'heart', 'accompanies', 'Manfred', 'Sid', 'journey', 'find', 'humans.That', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'nutshell.What', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'film', ""n't"", 'beat', 'sentiment', 'poignancy', 'subtly', 'important', 'themes', 'endless', 'scenes', 'warm', 'hearted', 'comedy', 'film', 'just', 'really', 'really', 'funny', 'sequences', 'never', 'seem', 'be', 'lacking', 'be', 'physical', 'comedy', 'witty', 'intellect', 'even', 'slapstick', 'child-like', 'comedy', 'film', 'perfectly', 'three', 'variations', 'comedic', 'delivery', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'feature', 'film.And', 'who', ""n't"", 'think', 'Scrat', 'best', 'animated', 'character', 'time', 'end', 'am', 'more', 'pleased', 'film', 'not', 'best', 'animated', 'film', 'time', 'more', 'respect', 'think', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'animated', 'films', 'are', 'carrying', 'weightier', 'messages', 'delivering', 'strongly', 'applaud', 'Pixar', 'taking', 'lead', 'adding', 'depth', 'genre', 'too', 'often', 'disregarded', 'childsplay', 'am', 'fault', 'very', 'act', 'blasphemy', 'past', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'forget', 'heart', 'animated', 'feature', 'smile', 'plastered', 'son', 'daughter', 'face', 'films', 'Ice', 'Age', 'bring', 'smiles', 'spades']",N/A

711855,A2Y0N656MWUCXU,B00006CXHU,Archanubis80,"[1, 1]","While the reign of the dinosaurs has been a subject movies have done to death, the era and animals that came afterwards has seen little screen time. This changed in the period between November 2001 and March 2002 with the release of the BBC's ""Walking With Beasts"" and Fox's ""Ice Age"".""Ice Age"", starring the voice talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Leary, is the story of three unlikely heroes who band together to return a human child to its tribe. As the story goes, Manny the Mammoth (Romano) and Sid the Sloth (Leguizamo) run across a dying mother and her baby, both of which have been seperated from their tribe by a pack of saber-tooth cats seeking revenge on the baby's father. One of the ""tigers"", Diego (Leary) is sent by the pack's leader to retrieve the baby, and attempts to lead Manny and Sid to the tigers' liar for dinner, with the two unsuspecting herbivores as the main course. Meanwhile, the audience is treated to the antics of a prehistoric rodent, Scrat (voiced by the director, Chris Wedge), a combination of a rat, squirrel, and raccoon, as he tries, unsuccessfully, to bury his acorn for the winter.Coming on the coat tails of Dreamwork's ""Shrek"" and Disney and Pixar's ""Monsters Inc."", comparisons with the latter movies are unavoidable. And there are parallels with the earlier movies; the ""return the kid"" plot is shared by ""Monsters Inc."", Manny does have the same sort of ""loner"" attitude that Shrek had, and Sid has attributes that are shared by Eddie Murphy's Donkey in ""Shrek"". There is also elements of the original ""Jungle Book"" spinkled in; the lead saber, Soto, is a near perfect copy of Shere Kahn. However, ""Ice Age"" has enough twists in it to be unique from the other movies.If you're looking for this movie to match the animation quality seen in ""Walking with Beasts"", forget it. The animation is not done in any ""realistic"" sense, and it doesn't pretend to, unlike Disney's ""Dinosaurs"". Although the animators for ""Ice Age"" did study the fossils from this period, it is clear they took a more artistic license to the animals. However, for Blue Skies and Fox's first foray into a CGI feature film, it isn't bad. The story and humor are enough to keep even adult's minds off the more artistic animation this film presents. The character interaction is nearly priceless; despite the fact the actors more than likely never saw each other, the chemistry comes off very well.Fans of DVDs will also be pleased with the extras that can be found on the second disc. Along with ""Scrat's Missing Adventure"", one can find the ""Making of..."" documentaries, will be amused by ""Sid on Sid"", and can see the scenes and concepts that never made it into the final cut. There are also games for youngsters for PCs with DVD drives.In all, *Ice Age* proves that can stand up to other movies such as ""Shrek"" or the ""Toy Story"" series. Although not as funny as ""Shrek"", it does rank above ""Monsters Inc."", IMHO. Although it will probably not become a true ""classic"", it will certainly keep audiences amused for years to come.",5,An Ice Age Comedy That's Not Frozen,1053561600,"05 22, 2003",2003,3059,"['reign', 'dinosaurs', 'been', 'subject', 'movies', 'have', 'done', 'death', 'era', 'animals', 'came', 'afterwards', 'seen', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'changed', 'period', 'November', '2001', 'March', '2002', 'release', 'BBC', 'Walking', 'Beasts', 'Fox', 'Ice', 'Age', 'Ice', 'Age', 'starring', 'voice', 'talents', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'story', 'three', 'unlikely', 'heroes', 'who', 'band', 'together', 'return', 'human', 'child', 'tribe', 'story', 'Manny', 'Mammoth', 'Romano', 'Sid', 'Sloth', 'Leguizamo', 'run', 'dying', 'mother', 'baby', 'have', 'been', 'seperated', 'tribe', 'pack', 'saber-tooth', 'cats', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'baby', 'father', 'One', 'tigers', 'Diego', 'Leary', 'sent', 'pack', 'leader', 'retrieve', 'baby', 'attempts', 'lead', 'Manny', 'Sid', 'tigers', 'liar', 'dinner', 'two', 'unsuspecting', 'herbivores', 'main', 'course', 'Meanwhile', 'audience', 'treated', 'antics', 'prehistoric', 'rodent', 'Scrat', 'voiced', 'director', 'Chris', 'Wedge', 'combination', 'rat', 'squirrel', 'raccoon', 'unsuccessfully', 'bury', 'acorn', 'winter.Coming', 'coat', 'tails', 'Dreamwork', 'Shrek', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'comparisons', 'latter', 'movies', 'are', 'unavoidable', 'are', 'parallels', 'earlier', 'movies', 'return', 'kid', 'plot', 'shared', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Manny', 'have', 'same', 'sort', 'loner', 'attitude', 'Shrek', 'had', 'Sid', 'attributes', 'are', 'shared', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Donkey', 'Shrek', 'also', 'elements', 'original', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'spinkled', 'lead', 'saber', 'Soto', 'near', 'perfect', 'copy', 'Shere', 'Kahn', 'However', 'Ice', 'Age', 'enough', 'twists', 'be', 'unique', 'other', 'movies.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'match', 'animation', 'quality', 'seen', 'Walking', 'Beasts', 'forget', 'animation', 'not', 'done', 'realistic', 'sense', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'Disney', 'Dinosaurs', 'animators', 'Ice', 'Age', 'did', 'study', 'fossils', 'period', 'clear', 'took', 'more', 'artistic', 'license', 'animals', 'However', 'Blue', 'Skies', 'Fox', 'first', 'foray', 'CGI', 'feature', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'story', 'humor', 'are', 'enough', 'keep', 'even', 'adult', 'minds', 'more', 'artistic', 'animation', 'film', 'presents', 'character', 'interaction', 'nearly', 'priceless', 'fact', 'actors', 'more', 'likely', 'never', 'saw', 'other', 'chemistry', 'off', 'very', 'well.Fans', 'DVDs', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'pleased', 'extras', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'second', 'disc', 'Scrat', 'Missing', 'Adventure', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'Making', 'documentaries', 'will', 'be', 'amused', 'Sid', 'Sid', 'can', 'see', 'scenes', 'concepts', 'never', 'made', 'final', 'cut', 'are', 'also', 'games', 'youngsters', 'PCs', 'DVD', 'drives.In', 'all', '*Ice', 'Age*', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'Shrek', 'Toy', 'Story', 'series', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'Shrek', 'rank', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'IMHO', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'become', 'true', 'classic', 'will', 'certainly', 'keep', 'audiences', 'amused', 'years', 'come']",N/A

Among the fun things for adults is a flock of dodos who will make it clear why they didn't make it. So we have this unlikely band of critters who were left behind when the great migration south took place: Manny the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth, and Diego the Saber-tooth Tiger. There's also a squirrel who never actually joins the ""herd,"" as Sid calls it, but whose whole purpose seems to be hanging onto the very last acorn. And there is a human baby.Diego was part of a gang of tigers that came across a human settlement and were vanquished by the hunters and their wolf-dogs. But one female, carrying her baby, was separated from the tribe and ""run to ground,"" or rather to leap into the water to escape. She manages to get her baby safely to shore just before she is swept away. Manny and Sid found the baby, and decide to return it to its tribe. Manny never actually meant to let Sid follow him, but Sid just won't let him alone.Diego, on the other hand, is blamed for losing the baby by the head tiger, and told to go get it and not to come back without it. So he joins Manny and Sid ostensibly to help them track the human tribe, but actually to get his paws on the baby and take it back to his leader.But the baby is just too, too cute, and wins the heart of all concerned. I won't spoil it by telling you how they do it, but they do manage to return the baby to his father.One of the very best parts of the movie is the ""epilogue,"" which takes place some 20,000 years later.

Now moving into computer animation, the studio probably has a big hit on their hands but it's nothing worth admiring. Whereas Anastasia had its beautiful widescreen photography and incredible musical score, and Titan A.E. had its imaginative settings and rock music soundtrack, Ice Age really has nothing to it that sets it apart from the rest of its crowd: the basic plot, that of three (male) prehistoric animals who come across a (male) Cro-Magnon baby and have to return it to its (seemingly all-male) herd before the titular geological era decimates them all (though with the lack of female company for all of them you begin to wonder if maybe it wasn't the weather that took them off the planet), is an easy buddy-buddy rehash of Pixar's latest offerings, most notably similar to Monsters, Inc.. On top of that, the animation is well achieved but nowhere the eye-popping work that was featured in the aforementioned Disney hit or previous wonders like A Bug's Life or the Toy Story movies. There are laughs (though not aplenty) and the kids will enjoy it, while anyone older than ten will find the blend of slapstick humour and touching camaraderie to be awkward and hapharzadly thrown together. Everyone else will find themselves annoyed at this continued theme in films that sees a man's discovery of his emotional side to be equal in historical importance to the invention of the printing press.

So we were unmoved by Toy Story and the genre it spawned of big-budget digital animations.  This one is different.  With an eerily lit backdrop of icy landscapes and a story borrowed from the classic western The Three Godfathers, this film treats the viewer to some of the most watchable animation this reviewer has ever seen -- especially facial expressions, which are wonderfully done.  The lead characters, voiced by comics Ray Romano (as Manfred, a laconic, anti-social Wooly Mammoth), John Leguizamo (as Sid, an annoying, lisping Sloth) and Denis Leary (outstanding as Diego, a duplicitous Sabre-toothed Tiger) bond into a herd while attempting to return a human baby to it's Cro-Magnon tribe.  On the serious side, this film deals directly with the different sides of the predator-prey relationship between humans and animals (most touching is the brilliantly animated scene in which cave paintings remind Manfred of how his own family was devastated by hunters); on the funny side -- well, it's hilariously funny from start to finish -- witty dialog, fast slapstick, and the running joke of a non-speaking pre-historic squirrel Scrat(who fights all the forces of Nature to hang onto his prized acorn) was so strong I suspect a sequel.

He usually has something funny to say throughout the movie.Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the big character of the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tiger.This isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice, sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters.

The film is extremely reminiscent of  PIXAR films such as ""Toy Story"" and ""A Bug's Life"", and ""Monster's Inc"" in pacing, comedy, and feel. However, it does not  come quite close enough to the quality of the previously mentioned movies. The plot follows a group of pre-historic creatures, including a gruff mammoth named Manny, a goofy sloth named Sid, and a saber-toothed tiger with questionable motives named Diego, who risk all odds to return a lost human child to its family. None of the characters are extremely likable and somewhat annoying with the exception of a supporting played named Scrat who does not utter a single word in the film. The animation is not up to the same quality of the PIXAR films, but is not too bad.

""Ice-Age"" is an exception as it is concise and interesting and is over so fast I found myself wishing it would just go on a while longer. While the technology is impressive as seen in the remarkable fire, moving water and smoke filled scenes, the technology is used sparingly which is good, as it gives the story a chance to shine, and it does.

After unsuccessfully trying to get rid of Sid, Manny and Sid stumble upon a human baby.The 2 then plan to bring the child back to the humans but they'll need help, so enter Diego (Leary) the Saber Tooth Tiger who seems a little shady.

Not only does this film work brilliantly as an allegory about bridging ethnic and cultural divides, but it is by turns hilarious and deeply touching.  The story follows a group of migrating prehistoric mammals (a saber-toothed tiger which is a predator; and a sloth and woolly mammoth, which are prey species) who find a lost human infant and ultimately make the difficult and dangerous decision to reunite it with its human tribe.  The personalities of all three are well developed, and their nonstop bickering is a riot.  Naturally, there are many internal divisions, and the saber-toothed tiger is secretly plotting to ambush the group, but in the end the shared experience of bonding with the infant unites them.  There is a highly entertaining scene where the group travels through an ice cave in which is embedded hilarious references to other life forms including extraterrestrials.  There is a very touching scene in which the mammoth contemplates human pictographs of hunters killing a family of mammoths with spears, only to be comforted by the human infant in his care.  The animation, especially the facial expressions for the animals, and of course the ill-fated squirrel whose attempts to gather and store nuts form a cruelly funny sub-theme, is incredibly clever.

The details in the animation isn't very sharp, but much of the visuals are still nice to look at. Our three main characters (Manny, Sid, & Diego) are very likable, and their clever dialogue makes all three of them act distinctive (except maybe Sid). The coolest character here is obviously Diego. The saber-toothed tiger has a slick & sarcastic attitude and a very no-nonsense approach to doing things. Denis Leary provides the voice, which is perfect for a character like this. As for Manny, I admired his personality but I didn't like his voice very much. I have nothing against Ray Romano, but his voice sounds very degrading here.

Grumpy and bothered by the rest of the animals, he decides to stick out the winter weather and heads for the glaciers. He runs into Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo), who nearly gets flattened by a pair of rhinos after unintentionally eating their favourite snack, a lone dandelion. Sid is a funny character, who's clumsiness and slow witted actions are annoying, but still rewarding to viewers as a big dose of comic relief.Elsewhere, Diego the sabertoothed tiger (Denis Leary) and his 'gang' of feline predators nearly snack on a group of humans, when they are fended off-but not before a mother and child are forced to leap over a waterfall to avoid certain death.  Manfred and Sid encounter the woman and child in a river later, and as the mother hands the child to the two bewildered animals, she passes on peacefully, leaving the animals with her son. Manfred wanted nothing more than to simply roam the wild on his four heavy feet, and not be bothered with such a burden. He's a classic loner with nothing on his mind but to be alone with his thoughts, yet he finds a lot of changes in himself in the days ahead. Their first meeting with Diego gives Manfred suspicions, and painfully takes charge to protect the baby, although he at first almost doesn't care. Diego does manage to convince the two that he  would be an asset to their team, and tags along, playing the wolf in sheep's clothing.A lot happens with the trio, like wrestling with a large number of hilarious do-do's who are desperate to protect a mere three melons for the possible oncoming 'Ice Age', or dangerous predicaments that force them to work as a team. I gotta admit that some of the jokes that refer to modern days are so typical regardless of how great this movie is (a small volcanic hole poofs out 'red' and 'green' for 'go' and 'stop' at a crossing, and the little boy spots a UFO in ice and gives it the Vulcan greeting with his hand), but those references are really the only smelly parts of the film.The little boy realistically gurgles and squeaks just like any toddler would, and innocently gets into mischief from time to time. He also starts to recognize the three animals as friends, and adores them all the way. A lot of the audience will adore the tyke too, who Sid refers to as the 'cute little wormy worm'.Also on hand is Scrat, a sabertoothed kangaroo squirrel who makes several appearences and has his own little run in's with the three as he constantly tries to bury a single accorn for later, and fails at every turn. He also helps start the film  by setting off a monsterous disaster that will leave you in stitches.The animation and colours are eye candy for everyone. And the sound effects are top notch, from footsteps, to echoes in ice caverns, to snowflakes falling,and it really sounds like it's snowing in the theatre/livingroom (if you have a good home theatre hooked up, listen to the flakes sprinkle!).Other voices supplied for the film, like Jack Black as the fidgity pathetic tiger Zeke, or Jane Krakowski and Lorri Bagley as two voluptious sloths who meet up with Sid in a mud bath hot tub, help round out the movie's characters. Leary plays it smart, and gives Diego a cynical shell to hide his underlying verocious intentions, but also sways him from his cunning tiger traits as he learns the value of caring. Manfred also starts to give into his heart now and then. Ramano's authoritive machoism starts to show cracks as the little boy touches them all. And Sid....what a character. John Leguizamo never lets us down. Watch how Sid gets ready for sleep, but gets under Manfred's skin immediately with his bad habits that would annoy anyone but himself. His buck toothed lisped vocabulary is just a hoot.I have never watched an animated film that has entertained me this much, than Ice Age.

The critter's big opening scene was added because Wedge felt a movie titled &quot;Ice Age&quot; had to open with tons of snow and ice. Scrat turned into &quot;arguably the most endearing and popular character in the film,&quot; he says.Wedge and Saldanha's talk seems aimed at pros and animation buffs. The directors point out a change in acts, discuss test screenings and reveal a few of their formulas (any emotion must be immediately chased with slapstick). The commentary doesn't have a lot of entertainment value, but it is informative and moves right along.The bonus materials on disc 2 should appeal to a wider audience. John Leguizamo vamps &quot;Mystery Science Theater&quot;-style as his Sid the Sloth character views clips. A making-of shows the highly engaged Wedge directing Leguizamo, Ray Romano (the wooly mammoth) and Denis Leary (the tiger) as they record their parts. All three actors complain a bit about having to work separately.Leguizamo put together &quot;a term paper&quot; on the ice age and his character before he came to work, Wedge says. The actor came up with about 40 voices to try out, taking into consideration things like sloths usually have a mouth full of grass.&quot;All you've got to do is watch a lot of Mel Blanc,&quot; Leguizamo says of voice work. &quot;Mel Blanc is a god to me.&quot;The menu is packed with shorts that break down the animation process. The basic but well-edited pieces cover lighting, rigging and how animators employed their own acting.

The way they designed him - with that long bendable neck - was just beyond hilarious. It made for so many ridiculous situations, like for him trying to get comfortable sleeping on a rock, falling crookedly while trying to climb a cliff, etc. And this didn't happen until movie #2 (I think), but when all the other sloths (in rainbow colors!) kidnapped him to make him fire god and proceeded to imitate all his movements, it turned into a song and dance.

711964,AWA0CA9AYL5YQ,B00006CXHU,Jennifer Litchfield,"[1, 2]","Ice Age is the next amusing chapter in the computer-animated family film genre.  Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say it is a rehash of the previous chapters.  It is certainly a fun film, with witty word play and some exciting action sequences, including an ice-slide ride which every child (and probably most adults too) would love to try out.  But one can't help feeling that the story is a little tired through previous overuse.  A group of unlikely acquaintances - this time comprised of a mammoth, a sloth and a sabre-toothed tiger - set out on a quest to return the obligatory lost-but-cute child to his family.The animation is adequate, but nowhere near the high standard set by Monsters, Inc.  This is particularly noticeable with regards to the various animals' fur, which is disappointingly static.  Additionally the background landscapes are very basic and the snow is somehow just too pristine.  Having said that however, the film does have some nice attention to detail, such as the eye tic in Scrat - the acorn-obsessed and incredibly unlucky squirrel.  The misadventures of Scrat are the best parts of the movie, and made more impressive by the fact that, as he doesn't speak a single word of dialogue, the humour is entirely visual.There are also nice character touches evident in Manny the mammoth (who has amazingly emotive eyes), and a sequence in which a cave painting comes alive and depicts a tragic scene from his past is very effective.  While an emotional sequence like this gives the movie a heart, its descent at the finale into saccharine sentimentality is somewhat cloying, but will probably satisfy the kids (and anyone else who requires a film to have a happy ending).",3,&quot;We are the weirdest herd I've ever seen&quot;,1046563200,"03 2, 2003",2003,1706,"['Ice', 'Age', 'next', 'amusing', 'chapter', 'computer-animated', 'family', 'film', 'genre', 'perhaps', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'say', 'rehash', 'previous', 'chapters', 'certainly', 'fun', 'film', 'witty', 'word', 'play', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'including', 'ice-slide', 'ride', 'child', 'probably', 'most', 'adults', 'too', 'would', 'love', 'try', 'out', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'story', 'little', 'tired', 'previous', 'overuse', 'group', 'unlikely', 'acquaintances', 'time', 'comprised', 'mammoth', 'sloth', 'sabre-toothed', 'tiger', 'set', 'out', 'quest', 'return', 'obligatory', 'lost-but-cute', 'child', 'family.The', 'animation', 'adequate', 'nowhere', 'high', 'standard', 'set', 'Monsters', 'Inc', 'particularly', 'noticeable', 'regards', 'various', 'animals', 'fur', 'disappointingly', 'static', 'Additionally', 'background', 'landscapes', 'are', 'very', 'basic', 'snow', 'somehow', 'just', 'too', 'pristine', 'Having', 'said', 'however', 'film', 'have', 'nice', 'attention', 'detail', 'such', 'eye', 'tic', 'Scrat', 'acorn-obsessed', 'incredibly', 'unlucky', 'squirrel', 'misadventures', 'Scrat', 'are', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'made', 'more', 'impressive', 'fact', 'that', ""n't"", 'speak', 'single', 'word', 'dialogue', 'humour', 'entirely', 'are', 'also', 'nice', 'character', 'touches', 'evident', 'Manny', 'mammoth', 'who', 'amazingly', 'emotive', 'eyes', 'sequence', 'cave', 'painting', 'alive', 'tragic', 'scene', 'past', 'very', 'effective', 'emotional', 'sequence', 'movie', 'heart', 'descent', 'finale', 'saccharine', 'sentimentality', 'somewhat', 'cloying', 'will', 'probably', 'satisfy', 'kids', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'film', 'have', 'happy', 'ending']",N/A

711970,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00006CXHU,Joe Sherry,"[2, 4]","A film by Chris Wedge and Carlos SaldanhaThe first hint I had of what ""Ice Age"" would be was a preview long before the movie ever came out.  The preview featured a squirrel trying to bury an acorn in the snow, but nothing was working and in the attempt to bury the acorn, the poor little squirrel inadvertently caused an avalanche.  It was funny, and it was the one of the best previews that I had seen.  Fortunately, this squirrel makes several appearances throughout ""Ice Age"" and steals every scene that he appears in (which is saying something for a piece of animation).  However, the main story of the film has nothing to do with the squirrel.A pack of saber tooth tigers are seeking to attack a human settlement in revenge for some of their own being killed by human hunters.  The plan is to take the human baby of the lead hunter.  The tigers attack, but the baby's mother manages to escape and dives into the river.  With her last breath the mother places the baby at the feet of a mastodon who is standing by the riverbank.This much is still set up for the primary story being told, and that is the story of Manfred the mastodon (Ray Romano) and Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo).  Since the world is in the middle of an ice age, the animals are migrating south to get out of the cold.  Manfred is initially going north to get away from everyone else when he comes upon Sid.  Sid was left behind and he also needs protection.  He's a sloth, but rather than being exceptionally slow, he appears to be more clumsy than anything else.  The two animals end up traveling together (over the objections of the mastodon), and it is then that they come across the human baby.  Manfred is ready to leave the baby behind, but Sid insists on keeping the child until they can find another human settlement.  Enter Diego (Denis Leary).  Diego is a saber tooth tiger who has been sent by his pack to reclaim the human baby as revenge for the pack.  Even a tiger fears to go up against a mastodon, so Diego pretends to have the best interests of the baby at heart and now we have the rather strange group of Manfred, Sid, and Diego all trying to return the baby (except for Diego, who is only pretending).""Ice Age"" is a very cute movie, suitable for children of all ages.  It is funny at times (any time the squirrel gets to make an appearance is a highlight for me), and it should be enjoyable for children and adults.  Excellent animation and excellent voice acting.  ""Ice Age"" is a good movie that should not be overlooked (even though it was overlooked in the theatre because of Pixar's ""Monsters Inc"").",5,"very cute, and the squirrel is a riot!",1083024000,"04 27, 2004",2004,2597,"['film', 'Chris', 'Wedge', 'Carlos', 'SaldanhaThe', 'first', 'hint', 'had', 'what', 'Ice', 'Age', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'preview', 'long', 'movie', 'ever', 'came', 'out', 'preview', 'featured', 'squirrel', 'trying', 'bury', 'acorn', 'snow', 'nothing', 'was', 'working', 'attempt', 'bury', 'acorn', 'poor', 'little', 'squirrel', 'inadvertently', 'caused', 'avalanche', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'previews', 'had', 'seen', 'Fortunately', 'squirrel', 'several', 'appearances', 'Ice', 'Age', 'steals', 'scene', 'saying', 'something', 'piece', 'animation', 'However', 'main', 'story', 'film', 'nothing', 'do', 'squirrel.A', 'pack', 'saber', 'tooth', 'tigers', 'are', 'seeking', 'attack', 'human', 'settlement', 'revenge', 'own', 'being', 'killed', 'human', 'hunters', 'plan', 'take', 'human', 'baby', 'lead', 'hunter', 'tigers', 'attack', 'baby', 'mother', 'escape', 'river', 'last', 'breath', 'mother', 'baby', 'feet', 'mastodon', 'who', 'standing', 'riverbank.This', 'much', 'still', 'set', 'up', 'primary', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'story', 'Manfred', 'mastodon', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'Sid', 'sloth', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'world', 'middle', 'ice', 'age', 'animals', 'are', 'migrating', 'south', 'get', 'cold', 'Manfred', 'initially', 'going', 'north', 'get', 'away', 'everyone', 'else', 'when', 'Sid', 'Sid', 'was', 'left', 'behind', 'also', 'protection', 'sloth', 'rather', 'being', 'exceptionally', 'slow', 'be', 'more', 'clumsy', 'anything', 'else', 'two', 'animals', 'end', 'up', 'traveling', 'together', 'objections', 'mastodon', 'then', 'come', 'human', 'baby', 'Manfred', 'ready', 'leave', 'baby', 'Sid', 'keeping', 'child', 'can', 'find', 'human', 'settlement', 'Enter', 'Diego', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'Diego', 'saber', 'tooth', 'tiger', 'who', 'been', 'sent', 'pack', 'reclaim', 'human', 'baby', 'revenge', 'pack', 'Even', 'tiger', 'fears', 'go', 'up', 'mastodon', 'so', 'Diego', 'pretends', 'have', 'best', 'interests', 'baby', 'heart', 'now', 'have', 'rather', 'strange', 'group', 'Manfred', 'Sid', 'Diego', 'trying', 'return', 'baby', 'Diego', 'who', 'only', 'pretending', 'Ice', 'Age', 'very', 'cute', 'movie', 'suitable', 'children', 'ages', 'funny', 'times', 'time', 'squirrel', 'make', 'appearance', 'highlight', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'children', 'adults', 'Excellent', 'animation', 'excellent', 'voice', 'acting', 'Ice', 'Age', 'good', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'even', 'was', 'overlooked', 'theatre', 'Pixar', 'Monsters', 'Inc']",N/A

711972,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00006CXHU,John F. Rooney,"[2, 2]","In ""Ice Age"" (2002), the first of the superb three-part series, some traditions are established that hold true for later films in the series. Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel, is wrestling with his prized acorn although in this outing some of his vignettes become brief interactions with the main characters. In later movies of the series he becomes more of an independent entity and even finds a soul mate. The stage is set for the later independently embedded cartoons in which the squirrel is constantly trying to conquer that iconic acorn, at battle with nature and his nut.At the beginning of this film there's a huge migration to warmer climes going on with lots of different species heading south. Manny, the mammoth (voice of Ray Romano) is going against the tide, headed in the other direction.This first film is noteworthy because of the presence of human beings, a sight of Stonehenge, and the very interesting episode with the prehistoric human cave drawings. Manny sees a mammoth family and becomes very lonesome about his own isolated plight without a mate.There is a great deal of story-building in this movie with many ideas planted for further chapters which will bring on the introduction of more characters, and mating instincts will flower.Manny meets Sid, the sloth, and immediately develops a dislike for the pushy Sid. Later they find a human baby, and both develop a love for the child. The baby is the catalyst for forming a new herd.Diego, the carnivorous saber-toothed tiger, is introduced as a predator, and he wants to grab the human baby for his tiger gang to devour.There's an inspired musical section with the extinct dodo birds who seemed too dumb to survive.For kids and adults watching there are of a lot of lessons to be learned. Manny saves Diego's life which transforms him into a loyal member of the new herd. He shows gratitude, and the baby helps to ""humanize"" him. The importance of friendship and loyalty, the need for belonging to a group, and the need for companionship-all of these come out of the dramatic action.In Blu-Ray this movie has stunning color and visual effects. There are a lot of scary adventures including cascading ice, molten lava, teetering icy crags. There's some bathroom humor that kids will probably get and titter over. Even though these are animals, the moviemakers have concentrated on characterization. They give human qualities to the animals (in fact they are almost ideal humans), and, of course, the animals speak English. It's full of vocal and sight gags. The movie is a treat for all.",5,A Great Start to a Great Series,1260662400,"12 13, 2009",2009,2564,"['Ice', 'Age', '2002', 'first', 'superb', 'three-part', 'series', 'traditions', 'are', 'established', 'hold', 'true', 'later', 'films', 'series', 'Scrat', 'saber-toothed', 'squirrel', 'wrestling', 'prized', 'acorn', 'outing', 'vignettes', 'become', 'brief', 'interactions', 'main', 'characters', 'later', 'movies', 'series', 'more', 'independent', 'entity', 'even', 'soul', 'mate', 'stage', 'set', 'later', 'independently', 'embedded', 'cartoons', 'squirrel', 'constantly', 'trying', 'conquer', 'iconic', 'acorn', 'battle', 'nature', 'nut.At', 'beginning', 'film', 'huge', 'migration', 'warmer', 'climes', 'going', 'lots', 'different', 'species', 'heading', 'south', 'Manny', 'mammoth', 'voice', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'going', 'tide', 'headed', 'other', 'direction.This', 'first', 'film', 'noteworthy', 'presence', 'human', 'beings', 'sight', 'Stonehenge', 'very', 'interesting', 'episode', 'prehistoric', 'human', 'cave', 'drawings', 'Manny', 'mammoth', 'family', 'very', 'lonesome', 'own', 'isolated', 'plight', 'mate.There', 'great', 'deal', 'story-building', 'movie', 'many', 'ideas', 'planted', 'further', 'chapters', 'will', 'bring', 'introduction', 'more', 'characters', 'mating', 'instincts', 'will', 'flower.Manny', 'meets', 'Sid', 'sloth', 'immediately', 'dislike', 'pushy', 'Sid', 'Later', 'find', 'human', 'baby', 'develop', 'love', 'child', 'baby', 'catalyst', 'forming', 'new', 'herd.Diego', 'carnivorous', 'saber-toothed', 'tiger', 'introduced', 'predator', 'grab', 'human', 'baby', 'tiger', 'gang', 'devour.There', 'inspired', 'musical', 'section', 'extinct', 'dodo', 'birds', 'who', 'seemed', 'too', 'dumb', 'survive.For', 'kids', 'adults', 'watching', 'are', 'lot', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'Manny', 'Diego', 'life', 'loyal', 'member', 'new', 'herd', 'gratitude', 'baby', 'humanize', 'importance', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'need', 'belonging', 'group', 'need', 'companionship-all', 'come', 'dramatic', 'action.In', 'Blu-Ray', 'movie', 'stunning', 'color', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'lot', 'scary', 'adventures', 'including', 'cascading', 'ice', 'molten', 'lava', 'teetering', 'icy', 'crags', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'titter', 'Even', 'are', 'animals', 'moviemakers', 'have', 'concentrated', 'characterization', 'give', 'human', 'qualities', 'animals', 'fact', 'are', 'almost', 'ideal', 'humans', 'course', 'animals', 'speak', 'English', 'full', 'vocal', 'sight', 'gags', 'movie', 'treat']",N/A

711974,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B00006CXHU,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[1, 1]","***This review may contain spoilers***Of course, we're used to animated features with truly anthropomorphic (human-like) animal characters, like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Yogi Bear, who act much more like humans than the animals they represent. But then, we have animated features where the animal characters are only partly anthropomorphic; that is, they largely behave and react like the animals they represent, except they talk and think like humans.  Almost any Disney animated animal is a good example.  The unlikely Pleistocene mammal trio in ""Ice Age"" - Sid the zany ground sloth (John Leguizamo), Manfred (Manny) the melancholy woolly mammoth (Ray Romano), and Diego the fierce sabre-toothed cat (Denis Leary) are even better examples of quasi-anthropomorphic animated critters.  Generally, in my opinion, it's harder to create a movie with quasi-anthropomorphic creatures than with fully anthropomorphic ones because the plot is limited by the characters' animal natures and capabilities.  I addressed that limitation in my Amazon.com ""Lion King"" review, and I wish to address it here.  As ""Lion King"" rose above that limitation with compelling, dynamic, and endearing characters and Shakesperean grandeur, ""Ice Age"" overcomes its quasi-anthropomorphism with sharply defined personalities and intense feeling.I'll do my best not to reveal all of the plot, which is basically ""The Land Before Time"" meets ""Three Men and a Baby"".  Manny reluctantly saves the Sid from two brontotheres; a grateful Sid sticks by Manny and tries to befriend him, although Manny constantly insists upon being left alone. They accidentally run into Diego and his ravenous pride, who are stalking a Paleo-Indian tribe in hopes of snagging the chief's toddler son for a meal.  While fleeing the pride, the child's mother encounters Sid and Manny and sacrifices herself in a raging river to leave the baby in the duo's care.  The duo run into Diego, who pretends to lead them to the humans to return the baby, but is actually planning to lead them into an ambush, where the pride can not only have a light snack, but a mammoth smorgasbord.I think you can see the obstacle with quasi-anthropomorphic animals.  If the animals were more human, or basically humans in animal clothing, it would be easier to accept the plot.  But with the ""quasis"" you have to suspend logical belief, because of course no wild mammal would be interested in a human infant except to satisfy its curiosity, or its hunger.  And yet, ""Ice Age"" manages to do it, because each mammal has its own compelling personality, the two-edged plot creates suspense, and the baby is illegally winsome and cute.""Ice Age"" also succeeds because the environmental and animal obstacles are amazingly but believably vivid and awe-inspiring and helps the ""Odd Triple"" surmount their bickering differences and pull together as a team (the weirdest team ever, according to Sid. Amen.).  The comedy that leavens the prehistoric proceedings also usually arises out of natural, general circumstances, instead of resorting to anachronistic refereneces for easy laughs (although the Sid/dodo football parody was ingeniously hilarious).  Besides danger and funny, witty dialogue and natural slapstick, there is genuine tenderness and pathos, not just because of the baby but because of the revelation of the reason for Manny's dour solitude.  Given that traumatic reason, Manny rises in our estimation because you'd think the last thing he would want to do is save a HUMAN baby.  And of course, we do see character development, not so much from Sid, who remains his cheerful, inept, happy-go-lucky self, but from Manny and Diego, who transcend mutual distrustful instincts and help forge an effective unit.What is ""Ice Age's"" final resolution? What do you think (hint: there have been multiple sequels, just like in ""Land Before Time"")?

You almost wonder if any of them are any good.  Do any of these movies stand a chance of becoming long-lasting favorites, such as ""Toy Story"", ""Monsters, Inc."", and ""Shrek"", among moviegoers, and not just the pre-teen ones, or are they merely thrown together by the major studios to compete with one another while offering vary little substance outside of what will entertain kids for roughly 90 minutes.  Well, there have been some success stories that have been released recently, though most are watched and then forgotten, but Fox Animation Studios' prehistoric laugh-fest ""Ice Age"" is one of the best and is sure to become another classic animated comedy joining the ranks of those I listed a moment ago.""Ice Age"" follows the hilarious exploits of Manny (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo), and Diego (Denis Leary) as they struggle to survive the impending ice age (hence the title) and each other, while they attempt to reunite a lost human baby with his tribe.  While all of this is going on, a prehistoric non-talking squirrel named Scrat is attempting to collect all the acorns he can to prepare for the deep freeze; however, this simple task may be too much for this stressed-out little guy to handle.Fox Animation Studios managed to create not only a hilarious computer animated comedy that will entertain audiences both young and old, but also managed to make one that stands out from the rest of the crowd.  The animation is very well done, though not as detailed as some of the competition from studios such as Dreamworks (creators of ""Shrek"") or Pixar (creators of ""Toy Story""), but it is still fun and visually interesting to watch with more of an abstract style than most other animated movies.  Featuring a hilarious voice cast, a story that keeps the audience rolling with laughter while still presenting moments of drama that propel the story onward, the creators of ""Ice Age"" have crafted a heart-warming comedy that the entire family will enjoy and want to watch over and over again.With all the computer animated movies released today, most are enjoyed by kids, but few are actually enjoyed by adults and teenagers, but it is nice when one comes along that caters to all audiences, and I'm sure the creators of ""Ice Age"" are happy that it will no doubt be one of the animated classics of our time.""Ice Age"" is rated PG for mildly rude humor.",4,Enjoy the Cold...,1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,2530,"['time', 'where', 'computer', 'animated', 'movies', 'seem', 'come', 'out', 'other', 'week', 'point', 'where', 'hard', 'know', 'ones', 'have', 'seen', 'ones', 'have', ""n't"", 'almost', 'wonder', 'are', 'good', 'Do', 'movies', 'stand', 'chance', 'becoming', 'long-lasting', 'favorites', 'such', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Shrek', 'moviegoers', 'not', 'just', 'pre-teen', 'ones', 'are', 'merely', 'thrown', 'together', 'major', 'studios', 'compete', 'one', 'offering', 'vary', 'little', 'substance', 'what', 'will', 'entertain', 'kids', 'roughly', '90', 'minutes', 'Well', 'have', 'been', 'success', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'recently', 'most', 'are', 'watched', 'then', 'forgotten', 'Fox', 'Animation', 'Studios', 'prehistoric', 'laugh-fest', 'Ice', 'Age', 'one', 'best', 'sure', 'become', 'classic', 'animated', 'comedy', 'joining', 'ranks', 'listed', 'moment', 'ago', 'Ice', 'Age', 'hilarious', 'exploits', 'Manny', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'Sid', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Diego', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'struggle', 'survive', 'impending', 'ice', 'age', 'hence', 'title', 'other', 'attempt', 'reunite', 'lost', 'human', 'baby', 'tribe', 'going', 'prehistoric', 'non-talking', 'squirrel', 'named', 'Scrat', 'attempting', 'collect', 'acorns', 'can', 'prepare', 'deep', 'freeze', 'however', 'simple', 'task', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'stressed-out', 'little', 'guy', 'handle.Fox', 'Animation', 'Studios', 'managed', 'create', 'not', 'only', 'hilarious', 'computer', 'animated', 'comedy', 'will', 'entertain', 'audiences', 'young', 'old', 'also', 'managed', 'make', 'one', 'out', 'rest', 'crowd', 'animation', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'detailed', 'competition', 'studios', 'such', 'Dreamworks', 'creators', 'Shrek', 'Pixar', 'creators', 'Toy', 'Story', 'still', 'fun', 'visually', 'interesting', 'watch', 'more', 'abstract', 'style', 'most', 'other', 'animated', 'movies', 'Featuring', 'hilarious', 'voice', 'cast', 'story', 'audience', 'rolling', 'laughter', 'still', 'presenting', 'moments', 'drama', 'story', 'onward', 'creators', 'Ice', 'Age', 'have', 'crafted', 'heart-warming', 'comedy', 'entire', 'family', 'will', 'enjoy', 'want', 'watch', 'again.With', 'computer', 'animated', 'movies', 'released', 'today', 'most', 'are', 'enjoyed', 'kids', 'few', 'are', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'adults', 'teenagers', 'nice', 'when', 'one', 'caters', 'audiences', ""'m"", 'sure', 'creators', 'Ice', 'Age', 'are', 'happy', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'one', 'animated', 'classics', 'time', 'Ice', 'Age', 'rated', 'PG', 'mildly', 'rude', 'humor']",N/A

Ray Romano is cast as &quot;Manfred.&quot;  Like another reviewer I was a little skeptical of his playing the role of a mammoth, but he pulls it off brilliantly.  John Leguizamo played &quot;Sid,&quot; and proves once again that he can play just about any character.  He is non-stop comedy animated through this entire flick.  Denis Leary is fine as &quot;Diego,&quot; who undergoes changes through the whole movie.  There is a very touching scene with him near the end of this movie that almost made me tear up.This movie isn't too violent.  There was no bloodshed viewed onscreen, and the animation actually softens up the battle between the humans and the sabre-toothed tigers.  It's funny how such a rigid animation style makes battle sequences look less violent than they are.  There are plenty of funny moments for the little ones, especially with &quot;Scrat.&quot;  The writing is intelligent, fun and none too boring for adults.

The heroes in this story don't start out as heroes at all.  Sid is an annoying and rather pathetic sloth who is left behind when all his friends migrate.  Manfred is a mammoth with ""issues"" who at the beginning is walking the wrong way for some reason.  Why?  Does the scene with the moving cave drawings explain this?  Was his wife and offspring killed, and was he walking the wrong way to end his own life?  Diego the sabertooth tiger is an order following killer on a mission.Each of these characters grow beyond themselves to save a human baby.  Sid assumes responsiblity and develops courage.  Diego learns to think for himself and do the right thing.  Manfred overcomes his grief and self-centerdness and endures all kinds of trials to save a baby who may grow up to be a hunter of mammoths.  This is a story how anyone, regardless of how non-heroic they may be, can rise above themselves and do what is right when they have to.Second, this DVD lets you watch the movie five different ways: Widescreen, Fullscreen, ""Nutty Movie"" mode where you can watch the deleted scenes as if they'd been spliced back into the movie, commentary mode, and ""extreme cool"" mode where you watch the movie in a window while documentary material plays in another window.  How cool is that?Third, the deleted scenes are actually very interesting.  They have their own commentary too.

On to the movie: You start off with a simple heard of mammoths, along with other species like rhinoceroses, sloths, and others.  A sloth (John Leguizamo) named Sid was abandoned by his own family and he runs into a mammoth (Ray Romano) named Manfred and he is continually annoyed by the sloth and his annoying self and sense of humor.  They later come across a mother holding her baby after she had jumped off a cliff next to a waterfall as a sacrifice to save her only kid.  After a moment of the sloth and mammoth arguing, they come to an agreement that they'd bring the kid back to his parents.  Shortly afterwards, they come across a sabre-tooth tiger (Denis Leary) named Diego, that played apart in the attack of the humans who asks to deliver the baby himself even though it wasn't for that purpose.  The tiger and mammoth compromise and all three find the humans together.  Through all the annoying moments with each other and mostly Sid, heh heh, they start adapting with each other.  Once they get close to the human tribe, they enter a cave and come to a point where there are drawings of their own kind printed on the rock...That's when they learn a little bit about themselves and who they are as a part of their own species.  They become very good friends with each other and they call themselves the weirdest heard, but they start to smile and have fun, along with Diego defending his friends from the rest of the heard of sabre-tooth tigers.  They start looking after each other in the funny times of danger that they have and, in the end, the mammoth proves that he does not want to harm the human tribe, but return their baby and part in peace.  The message that I see coming out of this animated movie is the friendship they have even though each of these three characters are different (sloth, mammoth, & a sabre-tooth tiger).  Along with fantastic animation and silly comedy for kids and adults, it has a great story for everyone.

I have seen reviewers for this movie and for ""Monsters, Inc."" choose one over the other.  There is no need to choose one movie over the other.  Both are funny, both are good, and both are worth watching and having.  Each movie has its own good and bad points, and I think there is no need to compare the two to each other, particularly since the only reason they are compared to each other is because of they were released relatively closely together.About 20,000 years ago an ice age is impending, and animals are migrating to escape the advancing ice.  During the general turmoil saber tooth tigers attempt to take a baby from a tribe of humans.  The baby escapes, but is now separated from his tribe.  The baby is discovered by an obnoxious sloth named Sid, voiced by John Leguizamo.  John enlists the aid of Manfred, a woolly mammoth voiced by Ray Romano, to aid in returning the baby to his tribe.  Manfred drafts Diego, a saber tooth tiger voiced by Denis Leary, to help track the humans.  Diego agrees since it allows him to steer the trio into an ambush.  This movie is thus the story of how this unlikely group attempts to return the baby to his tribe.What a journey this group makes.  It seems as though they skirt disaster and suddenly their salvation is a source of another laugh.  The movie continues in this vein up to the ending of the movie, which is well done and satisfying.  The ending was predictable, but for this movie the fun was not in the ending, but in the journey itself.This movie plays out like a Bugs Bunny or Road Runner cartoon.  The characters are not overly cute, and are often behave somewhat crudely.  With their relatively crude behavior, the characters appeal to an older audience than other animated movies focused on earning a G rating.  The animation was also interesting in that it was not the highly polished and detailed look of other recent animated features.  The characters are often angular and simplified in their execution.  Since the focus is on the action and the story, and since I quickly felt comfortable with the art style, I didn't notice the lack of detail in the characters until after I finished watching the movie and was preparing to review it.This movie is one of the best animated movies created in recent years.  The humor is slapstick and will remind older viewers of cartoons from the 40s through the 60s.  This film will appeal to children from about age 5 to adults.  Very young children may find the occasional violence and some of the situations the animals find themselves to be a little too intense.  For everyone else, sit back, relax, and get ready for one laugh after another.",5,Excellent Animation and Very Funny,1058918400,"07 23, 2003",2003,2720,"['movie', 'very', 'funny', 'loud', 'funny', 'Slapstick', 'funny', 'have', 'seen', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'choose', 'one', 'other', 'need', 'choose', 'one', 'movie', 'other', 'are', 'funny', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'having', 'movie', 'own', 'good', 'bad', 'points', 'think', 'need', 'compare', 'two', 'other', 'particularly', 'only', 'reason', 'are', 'compared', 'other', 'were', 'released', 'relatively', 'closely', '20,000', 'years', 'ago', 'ice', 'age', 'impending', 'animals', 'are', 'migrating', 'escape', 'advancing', 'ice', 'general', 'turmoil', 'saber', 'tooth', 'tigers', 'attempt', 'take', 'baby', 'tribe', 'humans', 'baby', 'now', 'separated', 'tribe', 'baby', 'discovered', 'obnoxious', 'sloth', 'named', 'Sid', 'voiced', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'John', 'aid', 'Manfred', 'woolly', 'mammoth', 'voiced', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'aid', 'returning', 'baby', 'tribe', 'Manfred', 'drafts', 'Diego', 'saber', 'tooth', 'tiger', 'voiced', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'help', 'track', 'humans', 'Diego', 'steer', 'trio', 'ambush', 'movie', 'thus', 'story', 'how', 'unlikely', 'group', 'attempts', 'return', 'baby', 'tribe.What', 'journey', 'group', 'skirt', 'disaster', 'suddenly', 'salvation', 'source', 'laugh', 'movie', 'vein', 'up', 'ending', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'was', 'predictable', 'movie', 'fun', 'was', 'not', 'ending', 'journey', 'itself.This', 'movie', 'out', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'Road', 'Runner', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'overly', 'cute', 'are', 'often', 'behave', 'somewhat', 'crudely', 'relatively', 'crude', 'behavior', 'characters', 'appeal', 'older', 'audience', 'other', 'animated', 'movies', 'focused', 'earning', 'G', 'rating', 'animation', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'was', 'not', 'highly', 'polished', 'detailed', 'look', 'other', 'recent', 'animated', 'features', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'angular', 'simplified', 'execution', 'focus', 'action', 'story', 'quickly', 'felt', 'comfortable', 'art', 'style', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'lack', 'detail', 'characters', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'preparing', 'review', 'it.This', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'movies', 'created', 'recent', 'years', 'humor', 'slapstick', 'will', 'remind', 'older', 'viewers', 'cartoons', '40s', '60s', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'children', 'age', '5', 'adults', 'Very', 'young', 'children', 'may', 'find', 'occasional', 'violence', 'situations', 'animals', 'find', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'intense', 'everyone', 'else', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'get', 'ready', 'one', 'laugh']",N/A

What the sloth and mammoth do not know is that the tiger is a spy for a group of tigers who want to kill the baby as revenge against its tribe. Since this is a kids' movie, this little problem is happily resolved at the end, but the setup does lend some suspense to the story. Along the way, the little troop has lots of funny adventures, many of them involving sliding around on the ice and falling about in the snow. It's the kind of stuff kids [and some adults] laugh at.

712010,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00006CXHU,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 3]","Ice Age had the unfortunate timing to be released at the same time as Monsters, Inc. The plots are quite similar: creatures whose livelihood depends on their conflict with humanity accidentally acquire a human child and must return him or her to his home. Monsters, Inc. does it better.That said, Ice Age tries very hard, and I found myself unwilling to brush it off as just a cheap version of Monsters, Inc. The animation isn't as good. The voice acting isn't as good. The script isn't as punchy or funny. And John Leguizamo is, if this is possible, even more annoying as a sloth.The animation is good enough to make the characters look like muppets but not so good that you're really drawn into the movie. There are moments of ice reflection and water rippling that scream, &quot;LOOK AT HOW COOL OUR ANIMATION IS&quot; -- and they are oddly disjointed from the rest of the movie's cartoony animation. To Monsters, Inc.'s credit, you never stop and gawk at the graphics in the background even though they're vivid and colorful.Surprisingly, the best voice acting comes from Ray Romano, of Everybody Loves Raymond fame. His brooding mammoth is compelling and a little sad. There's also a funny ice slide scene that's entertaining. There are also some very sad moments, like when the mammoth stares at a cave painting and relives the death of his family. Which explains why a mammoth is willing to take care of a &quot;pink thing&quot; (the baby) and return him to his family.And yet, Ice Age does not act on the strength of its convictions. In Monsters, Inc. when the bad guys are acting bad -- they're really bad. They mean to do bad things to children and even though they never pull it off, the audience is afraid that it will actually happen. In Ice Age, the threats should be twice as realistic. Although the movie actually has more violence and danger, it ultimately cops out: the mother of the baby just disappears into a fast moving stream (off camera, no less). Diego, the sabretoothed tiger who realizes he likes his new friends more than his own pack, seems to die and then -- SURPRISE! -- limps onto the scene at the end of the movie to joins his new &quot;herd.&quot; Ugh.In short, Ice Age is a first time effort for a production house that's not as mature as Pixar.

Ice Age comes along on their coat tails, aimed establishing nothing except direct access to your wallet.Of these two predecessors, Shrek is the fairer comparison, because its plot is very similar to Ice Age's: grumpy large beast, minding his own business, finds himself saddled with (i) a quest he really doesn't want (ii) and a wisecracking small beast he really doesn't want. Havoc ensues. Happy ending.This time, instead of an ogre, we have a mammoth. Instead of a donkey, a sloth. A quick witted, fast talking sloth, at that (ever hear of such a thing?). But, alas, not half quick witted enough.Here's the difference: Ice Age's Sid the Sloth is played by a session man, a professional voice-over artist, clearly reading verbatim from a rough house script, in a lisping Elmer Fudd voice. Shrek's Donkey is played by one of the funniest stand-up comedians on the planet, and while he must, one presumes, be looking at some sort of script, he sounds like he's ad-libbing every line.And that, in Ice Age, is pretty much all you get for dramatic activity: a smart-arsed Sloth. But added to that - or subtracted, more like - Ice Age has nothing of the multi-layered humour or visual complexity that makes Toy Story and Shrek such a pleasure to watch again and again. Instead of a babbling, teeming mass of hysterical bit-parts and cameos (a characteristic of both Shrek and Toy Story is that there is always something going on in the background) Ice Age features a background of ICE. Fairly easy to animate that, you'd think.It's a reheating of the classic western the Three Godfathers, apparently. This is meant to make it somehow all the more worthy. But it just means the plot is that much less original than it already seems.To sum: little of the wit, none of the warmth or appeal, and a fraction of the technical wizardry of its illustrious predecessors. The only thing it does have in common is the jokes. The SAME jokes.Avoid.Olly Buxton",1,"The stale aroma?

They are given a baby human by its mother to take care of it. The three set out to find the human tribe so that the rightful owners of it can teach it their ways, but Diego has to bring the baby to his herd master so they can kill it for revenge. Will Diego bring it to his herd so that they can kill it or well he help his friends take the baby back to its tribe?""Ice Age"" is a great film. I really like it. I remember watching this film awhile back and I still like it. The script is well written by Michael J. Wilson and flows smoothly. The colors are vibrant throughout the film. The background music really enhances the specific mood of the scenes and makes it more enjoyable. My favorite character is Sid because he is extremely funny and never hesitates to speak his mind. My favorite scene is in the very beginning when Scrat (Chris Wedge-voice) desperately tries to find a place to hide his acorn from the cold harsh wind. On one of his tries he pushes it too far into the ice and cracks the ground, then a huge wall of ice comes down and almost kills him.This film keeps me laughing and also produces many lessons to teach kids. One lesson is that you should help people and animals as much as you can, because it can result in a good ending.""Ice Age"" is rated PG with Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha directing it. It also stars the voice talents of the hilarious Cedric the Entertainer (Carl), Goran Visnjic (Soto) and Jack Black (Zeke.)I recommend ""Ice Age"" for ages 6 to 13. The genre of this film is adventure and comedy. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. It is great for kids, is very entertaining and has a great climax.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Brianna B.

it deserved.The start of a now on-going franchise(three so far),it stars the voice talents of Ray Romano as Manny the Mammoth,John Leguizamo as Sid the Sloth and Denis Leary as the saber tooth tiger Diego.While the plot meanders at times it always manages to find its way back and the pay off of the film is wonderful.The story involves a loner mammoth by the name of Manny or Manfred,and as a myriad of dinosaurs are walking in one direction in a giant migration Manny is walking against them.Two Brontops(rhino-like creatures)have discovered a lone dandelion and just as they are about to eat it Sid the Sloth comes upon them and unhesitatingly eats it.The Brontops go in hot pursuit of this gate crasher until Sid finds and hides behind Manny.Manny puts the Brontops on the run but they dog the pair throughout much of the movie,trying to get revenge they never can have.Meanwhile a local human tribe comes under attack by a group of saber toothed tigers,their object being the infant son of the chief.They manage to separate the mother and baby who,in desperation,jump over a large waterfall to escape the tigers.Down below she comes upon Manny and Sid whom she gives the infant to,as she slips away in the water in exhaustion.The tigers send Diego,one of their own,to get the infant and deliver it to them to eat.Diego tries his best to act like a friend and even says he will lead them all to a certain pass to meet up with the humans and return the baby;which is a set up as the tigers will kill them all.At first Diego is met with cynicism but over time the pair begin to trust him.And over time Diego goes from predator and liar to actually becoming attached to them and a real friend.The attitude change comes about through a few trials they go through as a group bonding them together.When they reach the pass Diego cannot watch his friends go to slaughter and warns them,even going so far as to step in to battle his own pride.After the dust settles Manny and Sid still stand while it appears Diego is fatally injured.They leave him behind in order to catch the human hunting party before it crosses through the pass.This they do and it is a tearful reunion with father and son and a tearful goodbye with Manny and Sid.Just at the last minute Diego appears over the hill to give a farewell gesture to the baby.It's another happy reunion and the trio head off into the wilderness.The film certainly received good reviews on its release and was rewarded amply at the box office.I hadn't seen it since that time and I must say it still holds up quite well.The plot meanders as much as the films protagonists but there are alot of cute and sentimental moments in it and the ending will have you in tears,guaranteed.Of course Scrat,the half rat,half squirrel appears as a running gag throughout the film and is always funny to watch.The Tae-Kwon Dodos were also a great""kick"" to watch.Diego's catch-phrase""Where's the baby?"" is as cute as cute can be.Technically the film is in both widescreen (1:85:1 a/r)and fullscreen and the picture is quite crisp and clear.Extras include commentary,three games and trailers.All in all a highly recommended family

His older sister still likes it, but is putting up with it really, as she is beginning to seek more sophisticated themes (at 11, we encourage this). I, the parent, can no longer sit through it because I get very tired of clomped heads, wacky well-meaning clods, evil hungry bumblers, and the cute child that is supposed to pull at our heartstrings. I think that our reactions reflect how different viewers will feel about this. I feel it is strung together rather haphazardly, with pretty stereotypical themes thrown in for political correctness (inter-species comraderie, etc etc.) Thus, this is an unoriginal formula film, not terrible by any means, but undistinguished.

712064,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00006CXHU,Roland E. Zwick,"[10, 13]","""Ice Age"" emerges as one of the better animated films of recent years, cleverly designed and even more cleverly written.  Scenarists Michael Berg, Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman have devised a story set 20,000 years ago about an unlikely trio of companions who find themselves making a long trek through a harsh environment in an effort, ostensibly, to return a baby human to the tribe from which he has become separated.  The triumvirate is made up of a deadpan, cynical mammoth, a wisecracking, over-the-top sloth (whose mile-a-minute mouth more than makes up for his legendary slowness) and a malevolent saber-tooth tiger, who learns a thing or two about friendship and teamwork before the adventure is over.""Ice Age"" is at its most amusing in those scenes in which the characters make prescient jokes about their own place in the evolutionary scheme of things.  One particularly clever scene involves the three travelers discovering what looks like an underground museum of natural history encased in ice, replete with ancient creatures caught in naturally occurring, chain-of-life exhibits.  Like most animated films set in the past, ""Ice Age"" derives much of its humor through the use of anachronism.  We chuckle to hear these creatures applying modern, scientific knowledge to the pre-scientific era in which they are living.The animators and designers have done a beautiful job in achieving just the right look for this tale.  The backgrounds have a colorful, clean, streamlined look to them, and the animals themselves, in their appearance and design, provide a witty commentary on evolutionary history.  Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary do superb voiceover work, each achieving just the right tone for the character he has been assigned to play.  One could wish, perhaps, for a bit less sentimentality at the end, but that is a minor quibble in a film that works so well for both children and adults.  The kids will revel in the cuteness of the animals and the clever action sequences, while adults will savor the sly knowingness of the evolutionary and historical in-jokes.  Not bad in an era when most films can't find a way to please even ONE audience demographic.",3,"cute, fun, enjoyable",1038441600,"11 28, 2002",2002,2193,"['Ice', 'Age', 'one', 'better', 'animated', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'cleverly', 'designed', 'even', 'more', 'cleverly', 'written', 'Scenarists', 'Michael', 'Berg', 'Michael', 'J.', 'Wilson', 'Peter', 'Ackerman', 'have', 'devised', 'story', 'set', '20,000', 'years', 'ago', 'unlikely', 'trio', 'companions', 'who', 'find', 'making', 'long', 'trek', 'harsh', 'environment', 'effort', 'ostensibly', 'return', 'baby', 'human', 'tribe', 'become', 'separated', 'triumvirate', 'made', 'deadpan', 'cynical', 'mammoth', 'wisecracking', 'over-the-top', 'sloth', 'mile-a-minute', 'mouth', 'more', 'up', 'legendary', 'slowness', 'malevolent', 'saber-tooth', 'tiger', 'who', 'thing', 'two', 'friendship', 'teamwork', 'adventure', 'Ice', 'Age', 'most', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'characters', 'make', 'prescient', 'jokes', 'own', 'place', 'evolutionary', 'scheme', 'things', 'One', 'particularly', 'clever', 'scene', 'three', 'travelers', 'discovering', 'what', 'underground', 'museum', 'natural', 'history', 'encased', 'ice', 'replete', 'ancient', 'creatures', 'caught', 'naturally', 'occurring', 'chain-of-life', 'exhibits', 'most', 'animated', 'films', 'set', 'past', 'Ice', 'Age', 'much', 'humor', 'use', 'anachronism', 'chuckle', 'hear', 'creatures', 'applying', 'modern', 'scientific', 'knowledge', 'pre-scientific', 'era', 'are', 'living.The', 'animators', 'designers', 'have', 'done', 'beautiful', 'job', 'achieving', 'just', 'right', 'look', 'tale', 'backgrounds', 'have', 'colorful', 'clean', 'streamlined', 'look', 'animals', 'appearance', 'design', 'provide', 'witty', 'commentary', 'evolutionary', 'history', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'do', 'superb', 'voiceover', 'work', 'achieving', 'just', 'right', 'tone', 'character', 'been', 'assigned', 'play', 'One', 'could', 'wish', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'less', 'sentimentality', 'end', 'minor', 'quibble', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'children', 'adults', 'kids', 'will', 'revel', 'cuteness', 'animals', 'clever', 'action', 'sequences', 'adults', 'will', 'savor', 'sly', 'knowingness', 'evolutionary', 'historical', 'in-jokes', 'Not', 'bad', 'era', 'when', 'most', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'way', 'please', 'even', 'ONE', 'audience', 'demographic']",N/A

Many have criticized it as being derivative of the other pictures, particularly Shrek, but I disagree.  The characters are well-developed and somewhat more interesting in Shrek, and the story is slightly more entertaining.  The animation is superb, and the Scrat character appears from time to time to keep this movie from taking itself too seriously or becoming monotonous.The characters are well-voiced, with Ray Romano providing the voice of Manny the Mammoth, John Leguizamo doing Sid the Sloth, and Denis Leary voicing Diego the Sabre Toothed Tiger.  Leguizamo, whose comedy I've never particularly cared for, does a first rate job with his character.  Romano sounds like he's going through the motions, but I suspect that's what his character is supposed to be doing.For those who need some basis of comparison, I would rate Ice Age as slightly better than Shrek and definitely on par with Monster's Inc.  The humor occasionally might seem to be a bit of a reach for younger viewers but this is what gives the movie staying power with audiences of all ages.  One or two have criticized its ""bad humans"" message, which is nothing more than a one time reference to hunting.

While the movie looks fantastic, there's plenty of humor and a darn good story to boot -- contrary to some early reviews, this is a good movie from top to bottom rather than a mere technical exercise.""Ice Age"" tells an interesting story of survival and comradery during, you guessed it, the Ice Age.  Prehistoric mammals are migrating south to escape the looming glaciers, but three unlikely partners, Manfred the Mammoth (Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo, complete with hilarious lisp), and Diego the Sabretooth Tiger (Denis Leary), join forces to reunite a baby boy with his human tribe after the death of his mother.  But not everyone wishes to see the baby's safe return . . . a competing agenda of revenge darkens the story considerably.""Ice Age"" mercifully has an edgy sense of humor, which makes the movie enjoyable for the adults who will be forced to watch the movie at least a dozen times by their persistent kids.  This humor manifests itself in unexpected ways that may require adults to make some complicated explanations to their kids, including when some juvenile mammals ""play extinction"" in a tar pit while on migration, or when a flock of ""Tae Kwon"" Dodos meet various grisly fates.  While these scenes are undeniably funny, they may be harder for younger viewers to understand or accept.  (This isn't a criticism, just something to be aware of.)""Ice Age"" takes an interesting step in having the animals speak English, but the humans communicate in grunts.  Fortunately, given the talents of the cast, we want to hear more from these animals.  Ray Romano is surprisingly good as Manfred the Mammoth, who is quite grumpy for most of the movie . . . until a very powerful scene involving animated cave drawings shows us that Manfred is entitled to be as grumpy as he wants to be.Perhaps the funniest aspect of ""Ice Age"" is a parallel story of Scrat, a frantic squirrel-type creature who is forever being foiled in his quest for acorns.  Scrat is also the subject of a separate short film that is a bonus feature on the DVD, and is equally hilarious.Long on laughs, complete with some tear-jerking, and blessedly free from any Elton John/Phil Collins-style tunes, ""Ice Age"" is an excellent family movie that will keep both kids and parents entertained on repeated viewings.

As an adult I can say I did not hate this film. It failed the ultimate goal of providing entertainment to both children and their parents via over the kid's heads humor and references. Films such as Toy Story, Shrek and Monsters, Inc. achieved this lofty goal and their commercial success is the result.The plot is pretty standard: a sloth, woolly mammoth and saber tooth tiger band together during the last ice age to return a baby human to the father. While the combination of characters is unique, the formula is very common. This is essentially an animated buddy road trip movie with three divergent characters who clash at first but eventually form friendships after spending enough forced time together.Romano does a fine job as the giant with a heart of gold wooly mammoth. The always insane Leguizamo stuffs cotton balls in his cheeks to voice the clueless and defenseless misfit sloth. And finally Denis Leary is the cunning and scheming tiger with a hidden agenda.The look of Ice Age is in the vein of a classic animated film, as opposed to a film like Shrek that achieves a near photorealistic level of detail. Although I doubt many of the kids who see these films could care one way or another.Ultimately from a viewer perspective Ice Age fails to achieve much in the way of originality. Its plot is painfully obvious from start to finish. The eventual turnaround from good to evil by Diego is a forgone conclusion. A return from a seemingly fatal attack by Diego in the final scene was an obvious ploy for a little unearned emotion and drama.I was bothered through the entire film by a nagging question. Why were these tigers so obsessed with this baby? The pack plans this whole elaborate attack on a human settlement just to get at this tiny baby. As a meal, this hardly seems worth it. The story alludes to an attempt at revenge and to ""send a message"" to the humans. I wasn't buying it.Finally there is a little bit of a left wing, harmony of nature, can't we all just get along undertone to several scenes. Nothing as overt or ridiculous as say Disney's The Lion King but there nonetheless.

I enjoyed them both very much, but if I had to choose one, it would be Monsters, Inc.  As you can see from my reviews, I don't watch many movies/DVDs, so when I do, it's a special occasion.One thing this movie has in common with Monsters Inc is the tender loving care that the &quot;big guys&quot; have for the &quot;little guys&quot;.  In Monsters, Sully (the big monster) becomes very fond of &quot;Boo&quot; who he protects from the ill-intentioned characters.  In Ice Age, it's Manfred taking care of a human baby and trying to return him to his &quot;tribe&quot;.Ice Age has a lot of very funny moments - some that only the adults will get, but plenty for the kids to enjoy.  Having viewed it shortly after Monsters Inc, I give it 4 Stars because I don't feel it was quite as brilliant or quite as creative as Monsters.However, it's great to see another movie company besides Disney able to make these excellent animated movies!

It does not have the technical polish or strong characterizations of ""Toy Story"" or ""Monsters, Inc."" but it is still a strong endeavor that doesn't embarrass anyone associated with it.  If anything, ""Ice Age"" is proof that quality animated entertainment is not the sole domain of Disney.While traveling south on a migratory trek, Manfred the Mammoth (Ray Romano) and Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) come upon a human child.  Determined to reunite the child with his ""herd"" of humans, the odd duo is joined by Diego the Sabertooth (Denis Leary).  Diego, unbeknownst to his traveling companions, actually wants to find the humans for his fellow tigers.  The threesome start to bond with each other as they overcome one peril after another and Diego is ultimately forced to decide whether his loyalty remains with the predatory tigers or with his newfound family.Animated films have become more intelligent to keep up with the increased sophistication of today's younger audiences.  This means that the animated fare of recent years now have enough substance to keep adults interested in them also.  The clever discourse in ""Ice Age"" that addresses the topics of evolution, extinction, and the implications of humankind's changing relationship with the other creatures on the planet is definitely headier than what is usually seen on Saturday morning cartons.  Yet, the intellectual dialogue is still subtle enough as to not thwart very young children who are only interested in seeing some cute and funny animals.  The voice talent shines with Romano being a particular stand-out.  ""Ice Age"" may not the most accurate representation of the far past but it sure is an amusing one.",3,"""I'm not fat.

712098,A123FC8GL7US1O,B00006CXHU,Troy,"[0, 5]","THE computer-animated feature ""Ice Age"" was advertised by one of the best trailers of the past decade.Wordlessly, it told the story of a small rat-faced, squirrel-like creature trying to bury an acorn, inadvertently setting off a gigantic avalanche of ice, and racing to escape destruction along with its prize.This wonderfully witty sequence, with its deft evocation of nature's power, turns out to be the opening sequence of the movie - and all too unrepresentative.Almost everything about ""Ice Age"" proves to be disappointingly generic. It probably features enough slapstick humor to entertain small children, but little of the inspired visual artistry or clever dialogue that made ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" such a pleasure for adult viewers.All the prehistoric animals are migrating south to avoid the oncoming cold. Sid the Sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo) oversleeps and is left behind by his family. Ambling after the animal procession, he irritates a pair of (apparently homosexual) rhinos (Cedric ""The Entertainer"" and Stephen Root) and has to be rescued by Manfred the Mammoth (Ray Romano).A gruff loner, Manfred is traveling in the opposite direction to the other animals. Sid needs protection and insists on going along with him.Not far away, a pack of saber-toothed tigers attacks a human village. A fleeing mother and child end up in the river and the baby is rescued by Manfred.He and Sid then resolve to return the infant to its father. They are soon joined by a saber-toothed tiger, Diego (Denis Leary), who claims to want the same thing, but has his own more sinister agenda.Catching up with the humans who have moved on from their camp turns out to be a tricky business. As the three squabbling animals and their infant charge follow the humans' trail into the hills, the challenges they face create a bond among them and they end up forming an unlikely herd.Along the way, there are a couple of decent jokes about evolution, an inspired roller-coasterish sequence in some ice caves and some long, slow stretches.A plodding script gives the voice talent little chance to shine. Romano as Manfred seems particularly muffled. Leary sounds oddly like George Clooney.With the exception of Sid, the faces of the animal characters are surprisingly inelastic and uncommunicative: Manfred, at least, furrows his brows into a kind of frown, but Diego is all but expressionless. The human characters look heavy and blocky, as if they were made of wood.",2,Highly Dissapointing,1069632000,"11 24, 2003",2003,2464,"['computer-animated', 'feature', 'Ice', 'Age', 'was', 'advertised', 'one', 'best', 'trailers', 'past', 'decade.Wordlessly', 'told', 'story', 'small', 'rat-faced', 'squirrel-like', 'creature', 'trying', 'bury', 'acorn', 'inadvertently', 'setting', 'off', 'gigantic', 'avalanche', 'ice', 'racing', 'escape', 'destruction', 'prize.This', 'wonderfully', 'witty', 'sequence', 'deft', 'evocation', 'nature', 'power', 'out', 'be', 'opening', 'sequence', 'movie', 'too', 'unrepresentative.Almost', 'everything', 'Ice', 'Age', 'be', 'disappointingly', 'generic', 'probably', 'enough', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'entertain', 'small', 'children', 'little', 'inspired', 'visual', 'artistry', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'made', 'Shrek', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'such', 'pleasure', 'adult', 'prehistoric', 'animals', 'are', 'migrating', 'south', 'avoid', 'oncoming', 'cold', 'Sid', 'Sloth', 'voiced', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'oversleeps', 'left', 'behind', 'family', 'Ambling', 'animal', 'procession', 'pair', 'apparently', 'homosexual', 'rhinos', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'be', 'rescued', 'Manfred', 'Mammoth', 'Ray', 'Romano', '.A', 'gruff', 'loner', 'Manfred', 'traveling', 'opposite', 'direction', 'other', 'animals', 'Sid', 'protection', 'insists', 'going', 'him.Not', 'far', 'away', 'pack', 'saber-toothed', 'tigers', 'human', 'village', 'fleeing', 'mother', 'child', 'end', 'up', 'river', 'baby', 'rescued', 'Manfred.He', 'Sid', 'then', 'resolve', 'return', 'infant', 'father', 'are', 'soon', 'joined', 'saber-toothed', 'tiger', 'Diego', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'who', 'want', 'same', 'thing', 'own', 'more', 'sinister', 'agenda.Catching', 'up', 'humans', 'who', 'have', 'moved', 'camp', 'out', 'be', 'tricky', 'business', 'three', 'squabbling', 'animals', 'infant', 'charge', 'follow', 'humans', 'trail', 'hills', 'challenges', 'face', 'create', 'bond', 'end', 'up', 'forming', 'unlikely', 'herd.Along', 'way', 'are', 'couple', 'decent', 'jokes', 'evolution', 'inspired', 'roller-coasterish', 'sequence', 'ice', 'caves', 'long', 'slow', 'stretches.A', 'plodding', 'script', 'voice', 'talent', 'little', 'chance', 'shine', 'Romano', 'Manfred', 'particularly', 'muffled', 'Leary', 'sounds', 'oddly', 'George', 'Clooney.With', 'exception', 'Sid', 'animal', 'characters', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'inelastic', 'uncommunicative', 'Manfred', 'least', 'brows', 'kind', 'frown', 'Diego', 'expressionless', 'human', 'characters', 'look', 'heavy', 'blocky', 'were', 'made', 'wood']",N/A

It probably wouldn't have the same impact hands down.  CGI simply enhances this story and it's characters a hundred-fold. The story is ingeniously a remake or variation of the John Ford/John Wayne classic THE THREE GODFATHERS. A mastodon (Manny/voiced by Ray Romano), a sloth (Sid/John Leguizamo) and a saber-tooth tiger (Diego/Denis Leary) become surrogate fathers to a lost neandertal child. The adventure begins as they take it upon themselves to take the child back to his tribe and must pass through the prehistoric ice age landscape (which further enhances the story as it becomes a character upon itself due to the great cgi background work) and run into a host of problems and obstacles.
