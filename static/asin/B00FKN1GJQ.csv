Great for family viewing or just wholesome entertainment.  The drawbacks include a weak script, very limited production skills, a message that was way too obvious from the start, and acting that was mediocre.  The whole film could have been less than 30 minutes in length with no loss of story value.

1671840,A10H47FMW8NHII,B00FKN1GJQ,"Jay B. Lane ""professional audience member""","[16, 16]","This presents a quandary, it's sappy and predictable, there are no surprises, the characters are pleasant and the movie, directed by Marcus Markou, is mildly diverting. Our 2013 Seattle International Film Festival audience was a bit testy after sitting through such a non-artistic entry from the UK. On the other hand, Yours Truly had a very nice time. I LIKE sappy and predictable, so I was happy.We start in a gorgeous white-on-white mansion, with a widower, his housekeeper and his three children, two are teenagers and one is nine. Their life is one of entitlement and ease. His lawyer's office is in the green glass building fondly called ""The Gherkin"" in London. (It really DOES look like a pickle!)Here are the actors and their characters:* Stephen Dillane (""Game of Thrones"") is Harry Papadopoulos, a phenomenally successful businessman, ready to build a shopping center in London when the bottom falls out of international banking.* Georgia Groome (""The Holding"") is his daughter Katie, forced to re-write her requirements for friends.* Frank Dillane (""Harry Potter"") plays his son James, who wants to be a botanist, NOT a businessman, and yes, he really IS Stephen Dillane's son.* Thomas Underhill (""Mother's Milk"") is his son Theo, who can see patterns and trends, loves to create order from chaos, and would LOVE to go into business with his father.* Georges Corraface (""Without Borders"") is Spiros, his ebullient brother, who never holds a grudge, is always upbeat and a little overdue to make amends for his past shortcomings, per the ninth step of his AA program. He had been in the fish-and-chip business with his brother back ""in the day.""* Cosima Shaw (Lots of TV) is Sophie, a lovely legal assistant assigned to negotiate a new mortgage which will allow Harry to reclaim his empire.Can you see where this is going? No bad guys, no sweaty bodies, no gunplay or vehicular mayhem, just decent people trying to sort out their lives with no blowie uppie stuff. And YES, I found it pleasing.

I loved the description, so gave it a try - and less then two hours later, still sniffling and swiping tears from my eyes, this became one of my favorite films of the year.A British film about a wealthy Greek widower in England who loses it all in a banking disaster, the film stars Stephen Dillane as Harry Papadopoulos, a food industry giant who suddenly finds himself broke ... then forced to move himself and his three kids both out of their mansion and their affluent lifestyle. With nowhere else to go, Harry turns to his estranged brother, the flighty vagabond Spiros (Georges Corraface) for help. The boys grew up, before their father died, helping to run the Three Brothers Fish & Chip Shop, which in recent years Spiros allowed to run into the ground until forced to close it. With nowhere else to go, Harry moves his family into the apartment above the restaurant, and tries to help Spiros get the restaurant going again, for the income (Harry wants no part of the family business anymore; he's above that now).The film is funny, heartwarming (yeah, I know, a corny term - but it's true), and ultimately about how the choices we make are nothing compared to the choices that choose us. I LOVED IT, and also got a quote from it that goes through my mind to this day, weeks later: ""Success is the joy you feel."" A truly wonderful, touching film about life, and how when life DOES force us to make lemons into lemonade ... sometimes the lemonade is better. If I could hug a movie, this would be the one.",5,"A hidden gem that may redefine your own definition of ""success""",1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,1672,"['Surfing', 'list', 'four', 'billion', 'titles', 'Netflix', 'streaming', 'queue', 'one', 'night', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'looking', ""'Papadopoulos"", 'Sons', 'crossed', 'eye', 'loved', 'description', 'so', 'gave', 'try', 'less', 'then', 'two', 'hours', 'later', 'still', 'sniffling', 'swiping', 'tears', 'eyes', 'became', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'year.A', 'British', 'film', 'wealthy', 'Greek', 'widower', 'England', 'who', 'banking', 'disaster', 'film', 'stars', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'Harry', 'Papadopoulos', 'food', 'industry', 'giant', 'who', 'suddenly', 'broke', 'then', 'forced', 'move', 'three', 'kids', 'mansion', 'affluent', 'lifestyle', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go', 'Harry', 'estranged', 'brother', 'flighty', 'vagabond', 'Spiros', 'Georges', 'Corraface', 'help', 'boys', 'grew', 'up', 'father', 'died', 'helping', 'run', 'Three', 'Brothers', 'Fish', 'Chip', 'Shop', 'recent', 'years', 'Spiros', 'allowed', 'run', 'ground', 'forced', 'close', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go', 'Harry', 'family', 'apartment', 'restaurant', 'tries', 'help', 'Spiros', 'get', 'restaurant', 'going', 'again', 'income', 'Harry', 'part', 'family', 'business', 'anymore', 'now', '.The', 'film', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'yeah', 'know', 'corny', 'term', 'true', 'ultimately', 'how', 'choices', 'make', 'are', 'nothing', 'compared', 'choices', 'choose', 'LOVED', 'IT', 'also', 'got', 'quote', 'mind', 'day', 'weeks', 'later', 'Success', 'joy', 'feel', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'touching', 'film', 'life', 'how', 'when', 'life', 'DOES', 'force', 'make', 'lemons', 'lemonade', 'sometimes', 'lemonade', 'better', 'could', 'hug', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'one']",Papadopoulos & Sons
