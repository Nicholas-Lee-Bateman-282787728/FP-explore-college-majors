What you get almost defies categorization.  We open with a glimpse of a recent concert, then a group interview where the Beach Boys discuss the reunion, then reflect on their past.  From there, this is almost a documentary of the history of the band.  But not quite.  There are discussions of the formation of the band, their first recordings, a few partial vintage TV clips, chat about the progression of the band to California girls and Pet sounds, recently discovered original footage of the band recording Good vibrations, and then we wrap it up with another glimpse of a recent concert.  If you didn't know any better, this would seem the imply that the band broke up in 1966, and reunited in 2012.Some of the discussion is interesting. But the problem is, it's too short for what it is.  Actually, I'm not quite sure what it is.  It's not a complete documentary of the band's history, it's not a documentary of the reunion, and it's definately not a music or concert video.What WOULD have been nice is if they did a 4 DVD package: 1)  2 hour Documentary of the history of the band 2) A DVD of vintage TV performances/videos etc. 3) Documentary of the reunion and recording of the new album and preparation for reunion tour 4) Full recent concert.This DVD is a little of each of those ideas combined and condenced into 50 minutes.  So, like I said in my review title, this is better than nothing.

It is not even close to a full concert. There is alot of talking and if you're a big fan, you already know most of their story. There is more studio footage of good vibrations than of their new album. I actually saw more studio footage of the new album before it was released. The bottom line is, I did watch it and I did enjoy it. It may be just worth buying it to see Brian singing ""Sail On, Sailor"".

1569399,AQ81L25HHHB18,B008KJZJTK,S.W.,"[5, 5]","As much of a Beach Boys fan as I am, I don't quite ""get"" this DVD. Unlike the title implies, it is not entirely a concert video feauring performances from the group's 2012 reunion.Although it focuses on their reunion somewhat, it seems to be more of a documentary on the early history of the band, from their formation to ""Good Vibrations"" in '66. There are a couple of problems with this, one of them being that most if not all of the group's longtime fans (especially ones who have been following them right from the beginning) probably already know their early history as well as their post-'66 history. Thus, a documentary --- or whatever this truly is --- on the group's early history (or for that matter, ANY of their history) probably isn't going to shed much if any new light on that history for  longtime fans.Also, for the folks who are just getting into the Beach Boys and don't know their history (or at least not their later history) and are unfamiliar with much (or most) of their music (especially their post-'60s material), this DVD simply doesn't provide enough information on the group's career overall. It would seem to say, ""After 'Good Vibrations,' The Beach Boys fell off the face of the Earth, and didn't reappear until this year.""The group's history from the latter part of the '60s onward, is ignored except for their 2012 activites --- that's the thing that I don't get about the DVD. It's under an hour long; it isn't like they couldn't have fit more onto it.For the group's newer fans, the DVD may be informative enough to make it worth buying for 10 bucks or less, but otherwise, I personally wouldn't recommend it. The footage of the group recording ""Good Vibrations"" may be cool, but in my opinion that's not enough to warrant buying the DVD.",3,"I don't quite ""get"" it",1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,1773,"['much', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'fan', 'am', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'DVD', 'title', 'implies', 'not', 'entirely', 'concert', 'video', 'feauring', 'performances', 'group', '2012', 'reunion', 'somewhat', 'be', 'more', 'documentary', 'early', 'history', 'band', 'formation', 'Good', 'Vibrations', 'are', 'couple', 'problems', 'one', 'being', 'most', 'not', 'group', 'longtime', 'fans', 'especially', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'right', 'beginning', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'early', 'history', 'as', 'well', ""post-'66"", 'history', 'Thus', 'documentary', 'whatever', 'truly', 'group', 'early', 'history', 'matter', 'ANY', 'history', 'probably', ""n't"", 'going', 'shed', 'much', 'new', 'light', 'history', 'longtime', 'fans.Also', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'getting', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'history', 'least', 'not', 'later', 'history', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'much', 'most', 'music', 'especially', ""post-'60s"", 'material', 'DVD', 'simply', ""n't"", 'provide', 'enough', 'information', 'group', 'career', 'overall', 'would', 'seem', 'say', ""'Good"", 'Vibrations', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'fell', 'off', 'face', 'Earth', 'did', ""n't"", 'reappear', 'year', 'group', 'history', 'latter', 'part', ""'60s"", 'onward', 'ignored', '2012', 'activites', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'DVD', 'hour', 'long', ""n't"", 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'fit', 'more', 'group', 'newer', 'fans', 'DVD', 'may', 'be', 'informative', 'enough', 'make', 'worth', 'buying', '10', 'bucks', 'less', 'otherwise', 'personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'footage', 'group', 'recording', 'Good', 'Vibrations', 'may', 'be', 'cool', 'opinion', 'not', 'enough', 'warrant', 'buying', 'DVD']",N/A
