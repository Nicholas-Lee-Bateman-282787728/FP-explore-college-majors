And there's nothing more that I'd like to do than enjoy a film like `P.S. I Love You'.  The previews show everything inviting:  A widow woman on the mend, a mystery with chain letters sent posthumously, the comic return of Lisa Kudrow, a heart-warming story about learning to live and love again after a loved one's death.  There's even a performance by Kathy Bates.The movie starts with a likable premise:  Gerry (Gerard Butler), a fun-loving pub singer and Irish immigrant dies of brain cancer and leaves his wife, Holly (Hillary Swank) to grieve immobile in her Brooklyn apartment.  Sounds good so far.  I came into the story thinking I might get the female flick (or male sensitive movie) version of `The Ultimate Gift'.  There were some problems with that movie, but the aspect of mystery with a heart is a real draw.Holly mourns for weeks, letting her apartment go.  Her mother (Bates) and her best friend (Kudrow) try to snap her out of it.  On her thirtieth birthday, balloons and a cake are delivered, complete with a tape recorder with Gerry's voice intact, telling her she's to follow the instructions from a series of letters meant to ease her grieving and move on in life.At Irish Teddy's Bar where he used to sing, bartender, Daniel (Harry Connick, Jr.) is the kind of jerk women love to hate, but tries to make a move while Holly's on the mend.  She goes out on the town and takes a trip to Ireland and connects with Gerry's family, but the film mostly falters.  The trouble is time is needed for these wounds, and the movie almost makes the four seasons of her grieving in real time.Unfortunately the movie didn't live up to the previews.  Here's why:  If the film were nearly as well edited as the trailor, it would flown better.  There's one speed they know best and that's slow.  Sometimes it's essential; at others it's deadly.  The material is drawn out; it's spotty for mirth and warmth.  There's a joke here, a letdown there.  The movie lingers over every development.  The flashbacks don't help the film much, either.  The delivery mainly feels forced.Swank gives a heartfelt performance that clearly identifies our sympathies for her plight, and Bates is as believable as ever as the hard-boiled mother, who underneath her exterior shines a true and loving heart.  Lisa Kudrow still has a likable return, even if the movie's timing gives her short shrift.  In comparison to his role in 'Bug,' Harry Connick, Jr. shows a real acting range.  Similarly, Gerard Butler shows his repertoire from feisty sword and sandal king in '300' to a likable character, worthy of grieving about.Despite good performances and a good premise, 'P.S. I Love You' fails to connect with the audience.  Unlike movies such as 'The Notebook,' and `Ghost' it fails to deliver the emotional depth one would expect from the subject matter with a script and direction that need to be lively at the times the characters and audience need it most.",2,Holiday Confection Falls Flat,1198627200,"12 26, 2007",2007,3011,"['nothing', 'good', 'confection', 'go', 'along', 'holidays', 'nothing', 'more', ""'d"", 'like', 'do', 'enjoy', 'film', 'P.S', 'Love', 'previews', 'show', 'everything', 'inviting', 'widow', 'woman', 'mend', 'mystery', 'chain', 'letters', 'sent', 'posthumously', 'comic', 'return', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'heart-warming', 'story', 'learning', 'live', 'love', 'again', 'loved', 'one', 'death', 'even', 'performance', 'Kathy', 'Bates.The', 'movie', 'likable', 'premise', 'Gerry', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'fun-loving', 'pub', 'singer', 'Irish', 'immigrant', 'dies', 'brain', 'cancer', 'wife', 'Holly', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'grieve', 'immobile', 'Brooklyn', 'apartment', 'good', 'so', 'far', 'came', 'story', 'thinking', 'might', 'get', 'female', 'flick', 'male', 'sensitive', 'movie', 'version', 'Ultimate', 'Gift', 'were', 'problems', 'movie', 'aspect', 'mystery', 'heart', 'real', 'draw.Holly', 'mourns', 'weeks', 'letting', 'apartment', 'go', 'mother', 'Bates', 'best', 'friend', 'Kudrow', 'try', 'snap', 'thirtieth', 'birthday', 'balloons', 'cake', 'are', 'delivered', 'complete', 'tape', 'recorder', 'Gerry', 'voice', 'intact', 'telling', 'follow', 'instructions', 'series', 'letters', 'meant', 'ease', 'grieving', 'move', 'life.At', 'Irish', 'Teddy', 'Bar', 'where', 'used', 'sing', 'bartender', 'Daniel', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'kind', 'jerk', 'women', 'love', 'hate', 'make', 'move', 'Holly', 'mend', 'out', 'town', 'trip', 'Ireland', 'connects', 'Gerry', 'family', 'film', 'mostly', 'trouble', 'time', 'needed', 'wounds', 'movie', 'almost', 'four', 'seasons', 'grieving', 'real', 'time.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'previews', 'Here', 'why', 'film', 'were', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'edited', 'trailor', 'would', 'flown', 'better', 'one', 'speed', 'know', 'best', 'slow', 'essential', 'others', 'deadly', 'material', 'drawn', 'out', 'spotty', 'mirth', 'warmth', 'joke', 'here', 'letdown', 'there', 'movie', 'lingers', 'development', 'flashbacks', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'film', 'much', 'either', 'delivery', 'mainly', 'forced.Swank', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'clearly', 'sympathies', 'plight', 'Bates', 'as', 'believable', 'ever', 'hard-boiled', 'mother', 'who', 'exterior', 'shines', 'true', 'loving', 'heart', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'still', 'likable', 'return', 'even', 'movie', 'timing', 'short', 'shrift', 'comparison', 'role', ""'Bug"", 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'real', 'acting', 'range', 'Similarly', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'repertoire', 'feisty', 'sword', 'sandal', 'king', ""'300"", 'likable', 'character', 'worthy', 'grieving', 'about.Despite', 'good', 'performances', 'good', 'premise', 'P.S', 'Love', 'fails', 'connect', 'audience', 'movies', 'such', ""'The"", 'Notebook', 'Ghost', 'deliver', 'emotional', 'depth', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'subject', 'matter', 'script', 'direction', 'need', 'be', 'lively', 'times', 'characters', 'audience', 'need', 'most']",P.S.

1116757,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,B000YAA68C,A. Boston,"[8, 9]","I found the book to be slow and depressing, and to me the movie was the complete opposite! Seeing the previews I was excited to see Gerard Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan and that alone almost sold me. But I thought maybe if they improved on it and made it more about...picking yourself back up then the book did that I would enjoy it more. I was right thankfully! I'll also say that I'm a big fan of movies like the notebook and a walk to remember, and this seemed to fall into the same caliber of movie for me.It really got you to understand the main characters' relationship and also kept the main elements of the book in my opinion. I usually don't really like Hilary Swank but she was charming and engaging(though, really shouldn't sing along with Judy Garland, that was painful). My only complaint was that I cried so much it gave me a headache, though, it would redeem itself by giving you a good laugh immediately following a really sad part. So I deducted just one star because by the end, I was mentally BEGGING them not to go thru another letter, I didn't think my poor tear ducts could handle it. I would also say, though I considered dragging my boyfriend(who apparently had no clue about the premise to begin with and would have been going in blindly!) it was much better to go with my best friend who had also read the book(though she said I cried too much). Its a chick flick in my opinion, though I have heard other guys didn't mind it. =) I would happily recommend it as a really fun movie that I absolutely loved.

1116760,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B000YAA68C,AIROLF,"[29, 39]","Unfortunately, this movie was poorly cast. The storyline is there, the idea is exciting and genuinely romantic. The cast, principals in particular is really off. there is no chemistry between Gerrard Butler and Hilary Swank. It comes down to Hilary Swank's inability to be a romantic leading lady. It's hard to imagine her romantically with anyone and Gerard Butler doesn't come through for both of them. Harry Connick Jr., who used to be a gorgeous crooner, from Hope Floats to a reoccurring role on Will and Grace has now turned into an overweight guy who is getting second-hand roles. Gina Gershon, who is usually great in each of her performances, is plagued by bad face impressions. James Marsters is extremely underused. Lisa Kudrow, the comedic light of the film, shows promise but could be a lot funnier and is generally a lot funnier in all her other roles. The only interaction that makes sense is that between Kathy Bates' character and Hilary Swank's. Their mother-daughter relationship is shaky but gets the much-needed boost at the end. The admirable features of the movie are all due to what must be genuinely good source material, i.e. the novel it is based on. The idea that the heroine isn't dependant on the guy for her salvation, but, in fact, looses herself in him is gutsy. The fact that her involvement with the love of her life stunts her ability to find herself and that it's his death that releases her is so fascinating to see on the screen and so real, that's it's scary. I only wished they would focus more on this and develop it. If they had only embraced it! Still, as far as romantic comedies go, it's refreshing to see that every once in a while there comes a movie that doesn't end with a happily ever union.",2,"great idea, bad execution",1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,1742,"['Unfortunately', 'movie', 'was', 'poorly', 'cast', 'storyline', 'there', 'idea', 'exciting', 'genuinely', 'romantic', 'cast', 'principals', 'particular', 'really', 'off', 'chemistry', 'Gerrard', 'Butler', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'down', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'inability', 'be', 'romantic', 'leading', 'lady', 'hard', 'imagine', 'romantically', 'anyone', 'Gerard', 'Butler', ""n't"", 'come', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'gorgeous', 'crooner', 'Hope', 'Floats', 'reoccurring', 'role', 'Will', 'Grace', 'now', 'turned', 'overweight', 'guy', 'who', 'getting', 'second-hand', 'roles', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'who', 'usually', 'great', 'performances', 'plagued', 'bad', 'face', 'impressions', 'James', 'Marsters', 'extremely', 'underused', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'comedic', 'light', 'film', 'promise', 'could', 'be', 'lot', 'funnier', 'generally', 'lot', 'funnier', 'other', 'roles', 'only', 'interaction', 'sense', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'character', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'mother-daughter', 'relationship', 'shaky', 'much-needed', 'boost', 'end', 'admirable', 'features', 'movie', 'are', 'due', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'genuinely', 'good', 'source', 'material', 'i.e', 'novel', 'based', 'idea', 'heroine', ""n't"", 'dependant', 'guy', 'salvation', 'fact', 'gutsy', 'fact', 'involvement', 'love', 'life', 'ability', 'find', 'death', 'so', 'fascinating', 'see', 'screen', 'so', 'real', 'scary', 'only', 'wished', 'would', 'focus', 'more', 'develop', 'had', 'only', 'embraced', 'Still', 'as', 'far', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'go', 'refreshing', 'see', 'once', 'while', 'there', 'movie', ""n't"", 'end', 'happily', 'ever', 'union']",P.S.

1116769,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000YAA68C,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","I never thought that I would say this, but `P.S. I Love You' is one of those movies that changed the way I viewed an actress, for the better.  Don't get me wrong; when Hilary Swank is on point she is ON POINT.  Just watch her stunning work in `Boys Don't Cry' or `Million Dollar Baby', both films garnered her Oscars.  The thing is, when you strip away the strength of the script or the power of the genre you have a substantial loss of talent.  Her performances in films like `Freedom Writers' or `The Core' and even `Insomnia' prove that she is not always `on point'.  That said, I was a little worried about how she'd fare with a romantic comedy (dramedy really).  I really thought she'd blow this one.She nailed it.I sat down to watch this movie with my wife because we are both fans of Gerard Butler (not because he's especially talented but more or less because he's nice to look at and or listen to) and we both adore the comedic talents of Lisa Kudrow.  We didn't expect too much, but what we got was a very nicely crafted tale of true love and the tragedy that is grief.Holly and Gerry are a feisty married couple who obviously adore one another despite their differences.  This is seen in the opening scene (which lasts for like ten minutes) where they fight and then make up in a rather realistic manner.  That was my initial thought going into the movie; that it seemed real, and I wasn't expecting that at all.  Next we learn that due to a bran tumor Gerry has passed on.  Holly has a very hard time dealing with this, obviously, but she has friends and relatives intent of helping her through it.  It appears though, that the only one who can save her is Gerry, who comes back into her life through a series of letters he'd written and arranged to have delivered to her over the course of the next year.  With the help of these letters Holly learns to let go and find herself again, find that nave teenager Gerry first met and fell in love with; the girl with dreams and ambitions and a bright future.Be forewarned, `P.S. I Love You' will most likely make you cry; or at least come very close.The acting is very well done across the board.  Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon are both wonderful as Holly's closest friends.  I only wish that they had a little more screen time.  Kathy Bates is always wonderful, and her portrayal of Holly's protective mother is very genuine and moving.  I am not a huge fan of Harry Connick Jr., but he manages to be entertaining here.  I feel that his character was a little insensitive and rather unlikable at times, but it was what they were going for and he nailed it.The stars of the show here are Swank and Butler who just ooze forth with chemistry that I didn't see coming.  We all know that Gerard Butler is a major dreamboat complete with a nice physic, an accent and loads of charm; but who would have thought that he was such a compelling actor?  He really nails his character inside and out and makes Gerry one of the most appealing men on screen.  I'm sure most any woman would love to have a husband like Gerry.  Swank blew me away with her mastery of her characters emotional fluctuations.  Holly is feisty one minute, giddy the next, defensive the next, heartbroken the next.  She's inspired and confused and aggravated and filled with adoration and she nails every shift, every feeling.  She gets every part of this woman right and delivers to us a complete and whole character, a person we can love and feel for.Another thing I really appreciated about the film is that, as much as it is warm and sentimental, it never shies away from the harsh realities of grief.  Even the way that some of her friends deal with Holly, the way her mother almost resents her grieving at times, the way that Daniel can't seem to get passed the fact that there was a Gerry; the way that Denise and Sharon want to move on with their lives regardless of how that hurts Holly.  It makes for a much more realistic venture into the life of someone who has lost a loved one.The world keeps on moving and eventually you have to catch up.In the end I highly recommend this movie.  It is a truly above average film that understands how to make a romantic comedy that has the right amounts of dramatic tension and realism to make it more than just another genre film.  As far as these types of films go, this is truly one of the best.  This is a film that could easily get passed over by those who consider it just another one of many, but it rises to the challenge and becomes something much better than expected.",5,P.S.

I was also mixed about Gerard Butler as a romantic lead...thought he was borderline cartoonish in the Katherine Heigl vehicleThe Ugly Truth (Widescreen Edition)but very effective as 'The Stranger' in the underratedDear Frankie.With that backdrop, I was very pleasantly surprised by this film.  I underestimated the impact of the Hillary Swank Likability Quotient.  [Her inherent likability being one of the big factors in her two Oscar wins.]  The opening scene of the movie is a revelation - a very well done 10-minute or so extended dialogue between Swank and Butler that presents the current state of their relationship about 11 years in.  The movie then goes forwards and backwards in time from there.  The quality of the acting is set in that first scene though - Hillary Swank's uncommon attractiveness and standout acting together with Gerard Butler's charm and ease of manner make for real chemistry.  As compared to, say, the fairly dreadfulDid You Hear About the Morgans?where I wouldn't have imagined Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant's characters together in a thousand years, you could fully envisage these two as a couple.  LaGravenese only strengthens that by providing you the back story of their relationship as the movie progresses.  When you finally get back to when the two characters first meet, you can see how and why Butler was immediately smitten.One casting note: Gerard Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan - a Scot and Yank respectively - are the two leading Irishmen.  Seriously?  They're both good, but not a single Irishman could be rounded up for either of these roles?The DVD Extras were a bit disappointing - no ""making of"" vignette (a little odd - usually a sign of people disassociating themselves from a film of questionable quality, which can't be the case here).  But kudos for a neat little (and kitschy) primer on ""The Name of the Game is Snaps.""I also have to make a snarky comment about the summary of the movie on the DVD sleeve found inside my red envelope (hint, hint).  The first line of the summary states that Swank's character is Dublin-based.  Huh?

1116775,A2WCNYAF5HR0PB,B000YAA68C,a reader,"[2, 3]","The best parts of this film were the scenes with Butler and Swank together -- both before his death and afterward via flashback.  Especially fresh was the scene when they first meet in Ireland (via flashback), and when Swank meets Butler's parents.  I would have liked to see the couple's relationship develop from the beginning, rather than using a contrived death and the business with the constant letters, which to me, got in the way of how these characters actually felt toward each other.  When one tells a story it is usually recommended as being more effective when one shows how, rather than tells how.....and the letters made it into a story that is told rather than one that is shown...the flashbacks SHOW how their romance began, and that is why they are so appealing and interesting.  Butler and Swank have plenty of star power, sex appeal, and certainly the acting chops for these roles.  The contrived letters took up so much time that I finished the film wishing it had had a more conventional plot.....if she had gone over to Ireland to see him before their marriage, meet his family, and so on, the actors had enough skill to make that fresh and new, but perhaps that has been done to death; at least they did not make the Irish look like yokels or buffoons; Gerry's parents seemed incredibly real, open, considerate, and sweet, and it would have been interesting to see Gerry with his parents, but we are not given that chance.  And Swank's delight in realizing that they did not hate her for ""taking Gerry away from them"" to live stateside was quite nice and refreshing.  None of the ""Meet the Fokkers"" stale stupidity in these scenes whatsoever.  Also the ending, where Swank and Bates arrive in Ireland was nifty.  Why did they not do more of that, develop that?  Instead we got the usual ditsy Lisa Kudrow (not my favorite) doing her usual innane thing -- who wants to watch Kudrow when you have Swank and Butler?  They only acted together for about 15 minutes at the beginning and end.  I just felt the plot was contrived to squeeze as many tears out of the audience as possible and I was hoping for more showing how their relationship developed.  Hope to see Butler in many more romantic comedies.  His comedic, romantic skills are SO appealing and his talents wasted in action flicks (300?  DOH!!  So ridiculous.)  I thought Swank was credible in a feminine lead, however, except in the flashback scene in Ireland at the end where they first meet, she seems mostly cranky in her scenes with Butler, which makes one wonder why his character would put up with her, since she seems to spend most of her time complaining and picking fights.  Why would such a happy-go-lucky guy like Gerry even stay with someone who constantly finds fault?  She was so sweet and open when they first met in Ireland, and willing to go along with the mad-dog story Gerry was giving her even though she knew the sheep dog was tame.....it would have been cute to go more with that lightness.  I would also have loved to see how her shoe designs grew out of her life with Gerry and her delight in him....  Kathy Bates was terrific; Harry Connick creepy -- a weird character who one minute was acting logically, and loaded with self-respect and a clear view of himself, and the next blurting innanities and acting depressed and self-defeating.  Why was his character even IN the film?  I cannot see how his character moved the plot forward at all.

1116782,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000YAA68C,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","I don't even know how to tackle THIS movie.It was like part comedy, romance, and drama all rolled into one.In the beginning a woman and her boyfriend argue over and over again, to the point where you think they're going to split up and go their separate ways.  The arguing wouldn't STOP!!Then, once the guy leaves the apartment room, he comes back in with a look of forgiveness on his face, and the woman comes running up to him and hugging him, and everything is all right again.So the first 10 minutes of film were nothing but typical relationship arguing, and then things go back to normal.NOW the weirdness comes in.The boyfriend supposedly dies, but for some reason, nobody was upset about that.  None of the friends, or even the girlfriend herself, were nearly as upset as you'd expect.It was at THIS point I was wondering if maybe I was watching a comedy and all that arguing in the beginning was just something not related to the main story in the least bit.  At the funeral they played a song for the boyfriend, and it had disturbing lyrics and everyone was singing along to the words, and even laughing while doing so.  I was VERY confused.Then one of the friends of the girlfriend kept running up to random men and asking them a few short questions, and if she didn't like the answer, she'd walk away from the men disappointed.  This was a good part, though why hit on someone after her friends boyfriend just died?  Talk about ignorant.Then, it gets even MORE bizarre.  Apparently the boyfriend wrote a series of letters to her girlfriend before he died.  Every couple of days (or weeks) a new letter would appear to the girlfriend, and I guess the letters were written as a way for the girlfriend to cope with his death, because the letters would lead the woman to a new (many times daring) adventure, such as going to Ireland and meeting another guy.I just didn't understand who kept sending the letters to the girlfriend if the boyfriend was dead.  He obviously knew he was going to die and knew what would be best for his girlfriend as far as happiness and moving on is concerned.  So who was sending the letters?Also, the character who played the mom was good because she was very serious all the time, and knew all the right answers.",3,bizarre movie,1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,2251,"['do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'tackle', 'THIS', 'movie.It', 'was', 'part', 'comedy', 'romance', 'drama', 'rolled', 'beginning', 'woman', 'boyfriend', 'argue', 'over', 'again', 'point', 'where', 'think', ""'re"", 'going', 'split', 'up', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'arguing', 'would', ""n't"", 'STOP', 'Then', 'once', 'guy', 'apartment', 'room', 'back', 'look', 'forgiveness', 'face', 'woman', 'running', 'up', 'hugging', 'everything', 'right', 'again.So', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'were', 'nothing', 'typical', 'relationship', 'arguing', 'then', 'things', 'go', 'back', 'normal.NOW', 'weirdness', 'in.The', 'boyfriend', 'supposedly', 'reason', 'nobody', 'was', 'upset', 'None', 'friends', 'even', 'girlfriend', 'were', 'nearly', 'as', 'upset', ""'d"", 'expect.It', 'was', 'THIS', 'point', 'was', 'wondering', 'maybe', 'was', 'watching', 'comedy', 'arguing', 'beginning', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'not', 'related', 'main', 'story', 'least', 'bit', 'funeral', 'played', 'song', 'boyfriend', 'had', 'disturbing', 'lyrics', 'everyone', 'was', 'singing', 'along', 'words', 'even', 'laughing', 'doing', 'so', 'was', 'VERY', 'confused.Then', 'one', 'friends', 'girlfriend', 'kept', 'running', 'up', 'random', 'men', 'asking', 'few', 'short', 'questions', 'did', ""n't"", 'answer', ""'d"", 'walk', 'away', 'men', 'disappointed', 'was', 'good', 'part', 'why', 'hit', 'someone', 'friends', 'boyfriend', 'just', 'died', 'Talk', 'ignorant.Then', 'even', 'MORE', 'bizarre', 'Apparently', 'boyfriend', 'wrote', 'series', 'letters', 'girlfriend', 'died', 'Every', 'couple', 'days', 'weeks', 'new', 'letter', 'would', 'appear', 'girlfriend', 'guess', 'letters', 'were', 'written', 'way', 'girlfriend', 'cope', 'death', 'letters', 'would', 'lead', 'woman', 'new', 'many', 'times', 'daring', 'adventure', 'such', 'going', 'Ireland', 'meeting', 'guy.I', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'who', 'kept', 'sending', 'letters', 'girlfriend', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'dead', 'obviously', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'knew', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'girlfriend', 'as', 'far', 'happiness', 'moving', 'concerned', 'who', 'was', 'sending', 'letters', 'Also', 'character', 'who', 'played', 'mom', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'very', 'serious', 'time', 'knew', 'right', 'answers']",P.S.

It was a story of a mother and daughter gaining a better understanding of each other.  That was so touching.

1116789,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000YAA68C,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 2]","***CONTAINS SPOILERS***P.S. I LOVE YOU is one of those films that falls firmly into the ""chick-flick"" category. The story surrounds the grieving widow, her mother, and her friends, and how they all come together to help heal after the death of the studly husband. Sound schmaltzy for you guys out there? It might be.But it is unique for a couple of reasons...First is that one of the main characters, Gerry (Gerard Butler,300) is dead. Although we meet him for a brief moment early on and during a series of flashbacks, he is, in essence, not there. We also don't get to watch him die. The death is startlingly quick, and it jerks the viewer to full attention because it is this sudden loss we see and feel via Gerry's wife, Holly (Hillary Swank,Freedom Writers), who also senses the loss of Gerry as extremely sudden -- due to a brain tumor, or so we're told.The other interesting thing is that Holly learns more about her husband after his death than during their short marriage. She travels to Ireland (where they initially met) at the behest of Gerry who, during his illness, arranged for Holly to have a life after his demise. He does this post-mortem trickery by arranging for messages to be dropped off to her at various times and from various people around New York. Initially seeming to be macabre, the story rapidly evolves into ...something more. Holly's trip to Ireland with her two best friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) reveal to Holly that there's a lot more life out there after losing your soul-mate. And she finds it in unique and disturbing places.Another unique quality was that Holly's mother, Patricia (Kathy Bates,The Golden Compass) turned out to be an accomplice within the entire story's machinations, something that took even me by surprise. Pleasantly. I also enjoyed the eventual dead-end relationship Holly ended up having with Daniel (Harry Connick Jr.,The Iron Giant) that I thought would turn out very differently. And Holly's Ireland love interest, William (the hunky Jeffrey Dean Morgan,Weeds) figures heavily in Holly's past and, possibly, her future.But even with all of this uniqueness, the story as a whole turns out fairly predictable. The grieving widow heals (albeit unusually), friends help her, mother helps her, and new friends and lovers make her grope for reason and what her life now means. It is schmaltzy, so just be prepared for that. Your wives and girlfriends will probably love it if you rent it for them, though.",3,Uniquely Formulated Chick-Flick,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,2488,"['***CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS***P.S', 'LOVE', 'one', 'films', 'firmly', 'chick-flick', 'category', 'story', 'grieving', 'widow', 'mother', 'friends', 'how', 'come', 'together', 'help', 'heal', 'death', 'studly', 'husband', 'Sound', 'schmaltzy', 'guys', 'there', 'might', 'be.But', 'unique', 'couple', 'reasons', 'First', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Gerry', 'Gerard', 'Butler,300', 'dead', 'meet', 'brief', 'moment', 'early', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'essence', 'not', 'there', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'die', 'death', 'startlingly', 'quick', 'viewer', 'full', 'attention', 'sudden', 'loss', 'see', 'feel', 'Gerry', 'wife', 'Holly', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'Freedom', 'Writers', 'who', 'also', 'loss', 'Gerry', 'extremely', 'sudden', 'due', 'brain', 'tumor', 'so', ""'re"", 'told.The', 'other', 'interesting', 'thing', 'Holly', 'more', 'husband', 'death', 'short', 'marriage', 'Ireland', 'where', 'initially', 'met', 'behest', 'Gerry', 'who', 'illness', 'arranged', 'Holly', 'have', 'life', 'demise', 'post-mortem', 'trickery', 'arranging', 'messages', 'be', 'dropped', 'various', 'times', 'various', 'people', 'New', 'York', 'Initially', 'seeming', 'be', 'macabre', 'story', 'rapidly', 'something', 'more', 'Holly', 'trip', 'Ireland', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'Denise', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Sharon', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'reveal', 'Holly', 'lot', 'more', 'life', 'there', 'losing', 'soul-mate', 'unique', 'disturbing', 'places.Another', 'unique', 'quality', 'was', 'Holly', 'mother', 'Patricia', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'accomplice', 'entire', 'story', 'machinations', 'something', 'took', 'even', 'surprise', 'Pleasantly', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'eventual', 'dead-end', 'relationship', 'Holly', 'ended', 'up', 'having', 'Daniel', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'thought', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'very', 'differently', 'Holly', 'Ireland', 'love', 'interest', 'William', 'hunky', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'Weeds', 'heavily', 'Holly', 'past', 'possibly', 'future.But', 'even', 'uniqueness', 'story', 'whole', 'out', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'grieving', 'widow', 'heals', 'unusually', 'help', 'mother', 'new', 'friends', 'lovers', 'make', 'grope', 'reason', 'what', 'life', 'now', 'schmaltzy', 'so', 'just', 'be', 'prepared', 'wives', 'girlfriends', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'rent', 'though']",P.S.

The #2 reason - Hilary Swank (2 time Academy Award Winner), who's good in everything.  I figured that if they ""signed on"" then it's got to be a good show.  It was.  I was apprehensive at first in regard to the plot, a dead guy who wrote letters to be sent to his widow after he dies.  I thought it would be lame.  It is such a great show.  Hilary is such a good actress, right away I felt like I was in her shoes, she made you feel like YOU were the widow experiencing the denial, anger, etc.  Gerard no doubt scored major ""chick points"" with his charming performance.  However I don't think he really even had to try too hard as he's very talented.  He got to use his natural accent and real first name for his character.  The ""Gerry"" in the movie wasn't too much of a stretch for Gerard as in real life he seems to be a very unique, energetic/lively, fun-loving guy.  Oh and the bonus was his smile & those eyes.  They will melt you every time.  I doubt there was any woman that didn't completely fall in love with him during his few appearances in the movie.  It was all very believable, nothing was far-fetched.  Thank you Hilary & Gerard for such an emotionally-charged movie; denial, anger, love, comedy, etc.  Absolutely worth watching again & again.  The music is great also.  All I know is that I left the theater crying and thought seriously about life being too short & to make the most of the time we do have!

1116799,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000YAA68C,Chris Pandolfi,"[35, 38]","As hopelessly contrived and predictable as ""P.S. I Love You"" is, it's still a charming, touching romantic comedy. The most surprising thing about it is Hilary Swank, whose resume of serious films has made a humorous role seem an unlikely choice. She makes full use of her softer, sillier side, playing a character that's loveable and irritating at the same time. I say this in spite of the fact that serious undertones run through the film, as they always do in romantic comedies; after losing her husband to cancer, Swank's character spends the rest of the film trying to find herself (for lack of a non-clich&eacute;d term). The twist is that her husband is posthumously guiding her with a series of handwritten letters, all of which were so strategically located that only a well-executed plan could see it through. A sweet but nonetheless baffling idea: How could a terminally ill man carry off something this elaborate in such a short period of time?Never mind--I was still moved by the light-hearted sentimentality of the story, so I have to give credit where credit is due. The film opens in wintertime New York City with Holly Kennedy (Swank) storming home, absolutely furious. Right behind her is her Irish husband, Jerry (Gerard Butler), who knows he's said something to offend Holly but doesn't know what. It isn't until they enter their apartment that they really let loose: Holly is offended because Jerry commented on her waiting to have children. Now back in their apartment, everything he says gets misconstrued in some way, and a full-blown fight ensues. It isn't long before they make up, however, and by the time they do, Jerry promises his wife that he isn't going anywhere, despite their financial troubles, despite their current job situations. After nine years, he still loves her. He'll always love her, no matter what.Naturally, the very next scene takes place at his memorial service. The audience is thankfully spared the unnecessary melodrama of his failing health and eventual death; no such scenes are included in this film. The filmmakers wisely chose to focus on what happens afterwards with Holly, who--as you might have guessed--is so grief-stricken that she shuts herself off and lets herself go. It isn't until her thirtieth birthday that things begin to change; as her worried family and friends sit by her side, a birthday cake is delivered with a mini cassette recorder taped to the inside of the box. Holly presses the Play button and hears Jerry's voice explaining that he wrote her a series of letters as he was dying. Holly will receive them all over a period of time, and each one will instruct her to do something bold and adventurous. Basically, his words will push her into living her life without focusing so much on his death.The rest of the film is all about Holly fulfilling her husband's last requests, from singing in a karaoke bar to meeting his parents back in his native Ireland (where--you guessed it--another letter waits). Her friends and family offer as much support as they can, all while engaged in their own minor subplots. Her best friend, Denise (Lisa Kudrow), is desperate to find Mr. Right, so desperate that she openly asks potential dates about their relationship status, their financial status, and their sexual orientation. Holly's mother, Patricia (Kathy Bates), loves her daughter but has trouble accepting Jerry's postmortem plan. She was never fully accepting of him to begin with; he and Holly married at young ages, meaning that a lot could have gone wrong. And Patricia definitely understands the pain of losing a husband (albeit under much different circumstances).The most interesting side character is Daniel (Harry Connick, Jr.), who works for Holly's mother at a local bar. He claims to have a syndrome: his social filter is defective, meaning he'll say anything to anyone at anytime. He openly tells Holly that she's hot, that she's a terrible singer, and that he's getting sick of hearing about Jerry all the time. Part of the truth is obvious--he has feelings for Holly. The rest of the truth is not so clear-cut--he, too, has been deeply wounded by a past relationship. From this alone, the two are emotional matches. That doesn't necessarily mean that they would work as a couple, especially with the inclusion of William (Jeffery Dean Morgan), the man Holly meets on her trip to Ireland. So the question is raised: Will Holly and Daniel find romance in the midst of tragedy? Will Holly allow herself to love again, or even to let her life go in a new direction?As fresh and exciting as I'm making this sound, the reality is that ""P.S. I Love You"" is a fairly routine story of love, loss, and emotional rebirth. That doesn't make it a bad movie by any means; in all honesty, I found it quite satisfying. Most of this has to do with Hilary Swank, who impressed me with her ability to transcend the heavy-handed, solemn movie roles she's known for. But the rest of the cast does a decent job, as well, doing justice to a well-established cinematic formula. I also appreciated the letter-writing plot point, simply because it was cleverly (if strangely) executed. Some may feel that Jerry's letter writing is a method of control, but do you honestly think that a romantic comedy would go that far? It's not control so much as it's a way to nudge Holly in the right direction--I believe that, were it not for his letters, she would mourn the rest of her life. And is it any coincidence that he ends every letter with the film's title?",4,"She Gets Letters, She Gets Letters",1198454400,"12 24, 2007",2007,5518,"['hopelessly', 'contrived', 'predictable', 'P.S',

I am the type of female moviegoer who didn't see any problem with Sean Connery playing the Mufti in The Wind and the Lion because he looked so good doing it.  Gerard Butler in this role is just as mesmerizing and intoxicating and is able to muster an Irish accent part of the time. There is also more eye candy.  Not since Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands have I felt guilty at having fun watching a movie about a grieving widow.  It is a comedy, isn't it.It is not a perfect film, but it is enjoyable for all the emotional buttons it push and how it tickles the mind.  I loved the casting. Hilary Swank should do more comedy.  Her voice is suited to it.  It was fun to James Marsters being human and American. Nellie McKay is wonderful. The line --There is no such thing as a vampire slayer - might not be the funniest line but it tickled. The production value is high.  I enjoyed most of the sound track. A couple of married men saw it with their wives and each recommended it to me on separate occasions.  The message of holistic love about life is fruit for thought.  Yes, I did cry a little.  Also, I am giving the game of Snaps a try as a party game. Oh, this movie introduced me to the beautiful songs of Laura Izibor.If you needed a theme to match other movies with this, I would pick some of the old ones Holly watches.  You could have a letter theme and watch it with The Love Letter.  For an Irish theme In America and Into the West both havie a theme of bereavement.

It's a story of a flawed woman who despite her flaws, is truly loved. About a man who reaches beyond the grave and helps her to deal with life again.There's realism to this movie--not just a smooth, easily flowing, wrap it all up by the end type of movie, although there is a bit of that too.

Hillary Swank plays such a high-pressure female always flying off the handle and finding it hard to relax. It was hard for me to see any chemistry between her and Butler or anyone else for that matter. There are some beautiful shots of Ireland in the Blu-Ray transfer, and the sound is quite nice. The story line is based on a very comprehensive plot that Butler concocts, that I find difficult to believe he could have forseen or even afforded to pull the scheme off. The whole magilla kind of peters out in the last reel and ends fortuitously for all (almost as if the studio had to call it quits on the film and end it happily).

1116828,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000YAA68C,Ed Uyeshima,"[15, 20]","Grief can be a painfully long process, but does that mean a movie needs to capture that experience in real time? Actually a year elapses in this marathon 126-minute film, but director Richard LaGravenese's episodic treatment is so sluggish that the end didn't come soon enough for me. This is the first of several problems with this 2007 romantic dramedy co-written by LaGravenese and Steven Rogers and actually not the biggest. That dubious distinction belongs to star Hilary Swank as Holly Kennedy, a high-strung Manhattan real estate agent closing in on thirty and married nearly a decade to Gerry, a hunky, free-wheeling Irish musician. Physically angular with a performance pitched between severely pinched and gawkily awkward, Swank lacks the innate malleability to carry off the role. It's the type that Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock can do in their sleep, but obviously the torch has to be passed. Despite moments of genuine likeability and vulnerability, Swank lets it drop.The movie opens with a lengthy and extremely contrived marital squabble between Holly and Gerry and then wastes no time in flashing forward months later to Gerry's wake at the Irish bar that Holly's mother runs. Throughout the rest of the movie, Holly grieves by having frequent flashbacks to the happier days with Gerry, that is, when she is not fantasizing about Gerry still being alive. The plot turns on the conceit that he wrote a series of letters before his death that he intends to be delivered to Holly at key moments during her first year without him, and Holly's responses to the letters make up what constitutes the impetus of the storyline. There are some poorly developed turns, but there are some good moments primarily courtesy of an unusually stellar supporting cast starting with Kathy Bates as Holly's straight-shooting mother whose own husband left her in a less tragic manner; Gina Gershon as Sharon, one of Holly's best friends; and Lisa Kudrow as her other friend, the more hedonistic Denise. In fact, Kudrow's crack comedy timing is such a contrast to Swank's tentative, redundant manner that it upsets the balance of the film.The men fare somewhat better. A genuinely charismatic actor, Gerard Butler plays Gerry with such unfettered joy that it really is a wonder why he is attracted to Holly in the first place. Their ""cute"" first encounter on an isolated Irish road is painful to watch not because of Gerry's impending doom but because Swank overdoes her impersonation of a nave college student. As potential paramour Billy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, an American actor who actually does a better Irish accent than Butler (a Scotsman) lends the necessary smoldering presence, but he is painted too ideally to be that compelling. Harry Connick, Jr., on the other hand, plays a genuinely idiosyncratic suitor, Daniel, a somewhat off-kilter bartender who may have Asperger's Syndrome. It's an oddly discomforting ploy, but at least it's different, and Connick shows he still has a good comedy sense. Rural Ireland certainly looks idyllic thanks to Terry Stacey's cinematography, although I have to say the musical soundtrack comes across as too predictably coy to help complement scenes. I recommend skipping this one for more worthwhile treatments on grieving like Anthony Minghella'sTruly Madly Deeplyor even Jerry Zucker'sGhost.",2,"Overlong, Episodic Look at the Grieving Process Spotlighting an Uncharacteristically Miscast Swank",1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,3330,"['Grief', 'can', 'be', 'painfully', 'long', 'process', 'mean', 'movie', 'capture', 'experience', 'real', 'time', 'Actually', 'year', 'marathon', '126-minute', 'film', 'director', 'Richard', 'LaGravenese', 'episodic', 'treatment', 'so', 'sluggish', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'soon', 'enough', 'first', 'several', 'problems', '2007', 'romantic', 'dramedy', 'co-written', 'LaGravenese', 'Steven', 'Rogers', 'actually', 'not', 'biggest', 'dubious', 'distinction', 'belongs', 'star', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Holly', 'Kennedy', 'high-strung', 'Manhattan', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'closing', 'thirty', 'married', 'nearly', 'decade', 'Gerry', 'hunky', 'free-wheeling', 'Irish', 'musician', 'Physically', 'angular', 'performance', 'pitched', 'severely', 'pinched', 'gawkily', 'awkward', 'Swank', 'innate', 'malleability', 'carry', 'off', 'role', 'type', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'can', 'do', 'sleep', 'obviously', 'torch', 'be', 'passed', 'moments', 'genuine', 'likeability', 'vulnerability', 'Swank', 'drop.The', 'movie', 'lengthy', 'extremely', 'contrived', 'marital', 'squabble', 'Holly', 'Gerry', 'then', 'time', 'flashing', 'forward', 'months', 'later', 'Gerry', 'wake', 'Irish', 'bar', 'Holly', 'mother', 'rest', 'movie', 'Holly', 'having', 'frequent', 'flashbacks', 'happier', 'days', 'Gerry', 'when', 'not', 'fantasizing', 'Gerry', 'still', 'being', 'alive', 'plot', 'conceit', 'wrote', 'series', 'letters', 'death', 'be', 'delivered', 'Holly', 'key', 'moments', 'first', 'year', 'Holly', 'responses', 'letters', 'make', 'up', 'what', 'impetus', 'storyline', 'are', 'poorly', 'developed', 'turns', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'primarily', 'courtesy', 'unusually', 'stellar', 'supporting', 'cast', 'starting', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Holly', 'straight-shooting', 'mother', 'own', 'husband', 'left', 'less', 'tragic', 'manner', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'Sharon', 'one', 'Holly', 'best', 'friends', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'other', 'friend', 'more', 'hedonistic', 'Denise', 'fact', 'Kudrow', 'crack', 'comedy', 'timing', 'such', 'contrast', 'Swank', 'tentative', 'redundant', 'manner', 'balance', 'film.The', 'men', 'fare', 'somewhat', 'better', 'A', 'genuinely', 'charismatic', 'actor', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Gerry', 'such', 'unfettered', 'joy', 'really', 'wonder', 'why', 'attracted', 'Holly', 'first', 'place', 'cute', 'first', 'encounter', 'isolated', 'Irish', 'road', 'painful', 'watch', 'not', 'Gerry', 'impending', 'doom', 'Swank', 'impersonation', 'nave', 'college', 'student', 'potential', 'paramour', 'Billy', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'American', 'actor', 'who', 'actually', 'better', 'Irish', 'accent', 'Butler', 'Scotsman', 'necessary', 'smoldering', 'presence', 'painted', 'too', 'ideally', 'be', 'compelling', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'other', 'hand', 'genuinely', 'idiosyncratic', 'suitor', 'Daniel', 'somewhat', 'off-kilter', 'bartender', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'oddly', 'discomforting', 'ploy', 'least', 'different', 'Connick', 'still', 'good', 'comedy', 'sense', 'Rural', 'Ireland', 'certainly', 'idyllic', 'thanks', 'Terry', 'Stacey', 'cinematography', 'have', 'say', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'predictably', 'coy', 'help', 'complement', 'scenes', 'recommend', 'skipping', 'one', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'treatments', 'grieving', 'Anthony', ""Minghella'sTruly"", 'Madly', 'Deeplyor', 'even', 'Jerry', ""Zucker'sGhost""]",P.S.

Also awkward was the one-night stand Swank has with Billy Gallagher. That just did not seem in keeping with her personality throughout the movie. How odd.The kareoke scenes were TORTURE.Literally two-hours of self-pity for a young woman who's lost her husband.

Their give-and-take marriage of nine years, could have been much more successful for Holly and Geery. After their numerous battles and continual make-ups, I became caught-up in a greatly improved story-plot.My favorite personality was Holly played by Hilary Swank! Quite a uniquely romantic role after The Million Dollar Baby.  As this story developed, I became more enamored by Kathy Bates as Mother and the bar-tender William played by Harry Connick,Jr. After Geery's hysterical Memorial Service, the movie evolved into one great, compelling, fascinating Romantic Comedy!The next uniquely interesting character was the Irishman, William! When Geery's carefully planned letters came to Holly, one was a suggested trip for her to travel to Ireland. There she came upon the deceased's former friend from childhood, William. Those letters continued for the first year's absence of her Beloved. Her three close girl friends insisted she was overdue for another sexually stimulating experience! For me it was a close tie between the romantic escapade and the beauty of the Irish country side.All-in-all this was the most compelling, entertaining, and fascinating romantic comedy yet for me.

The general trailer and the billboards seem to set the audience up for a sappy tearjerker. But happily what happens in this film is not the expected 'widowed person communicating with the dead love out of failure to get on with life' tale, but instead a look into the importance of friendship, family, and adjusting to the incomparable loss. Credit the original novel by Cecelia Ahern as adapted for the screen by Steven Rogers writer/director Richard LaGravenese for making what so easily have been a sappy, maudlin, whining tale into a  touching one of human emotions with a sense of reality mixed with a mildly implausible situation, and a  series of character studies that emphasize the importance of support in the time of grief.Holly (Hilary Swank) and Gerry (Gerard Butler) Kennedy are a married couple with goals and frustrations and a huge dollop of passionate love, surrounded by friends and family. The tragedy happens just as the movie starts: Gerry has died of a brain tumor leaving the copeless Holly alone with her memories and self-inflicted regrets.  But Gerry, knowing he was a terminal patient, devised his own plan to help Holly through that first year of grief: he left letters in various forms and places, advising Holly how to learn about his family and how to get on with life. Holly's mother (Kathy Bates) owns a bar and has supported her little family since Holly's father deserted his family years ago.  In the bar is another injured soul named Daniel (Harry Connick  Jr.) who fancies Holly but realizes she is far from ready to think about dating. Holly's friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) accompany Holly to Gerry's pre-planned trip to his home in Ireland to meet the in-laws Holly never knew.  While in Ireland Holly reminisces  on the magic of first meeting Gerry, meets Gerry's parents as well as Gerry's best friend William (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and through it all manages to appreciate the gift of PS I Love You letters and reminders Gerry has left for her.  And she ultimately finds closure to her loss.The cast is strong and makes these at times strained characters into lovable people: Hilary Swank has made a successful entrance into the feminine lead role and is balanced to perfection by Butler, Morgan, Connick, Bates, Kudrow and  Gershon.  They make the implausible plausible and deliver a love story that goes beyond the level of superficial to join the ranks of warm and tender memorable slices of life.  It is surprisingly good!

Experiencing it in 1080i made me convinced that 1080p would be spectacular and I was not disappointed.The Irish scenes in particular, with their fields of wildflowers and greening meadows, are almost dreamlike.

1116849,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B000YAA68C,Hikari,"[4, 6]","Rarely (like, almost never) has a film come along with such a gulf between its critical reviews (ie, professionally-considered notions of 'quality') and its popular reception.  The professional film critics universally say this stinks worse than a boiled cabbage and corned beef dinner left in the sun.  Yet the reviews I received from enthusiastic friends were the polar opposite.  They laughed, they cried, they hadn't seen such a touching and memorable movie for years, they were definitely going to buy this for their own.  Letting friendship win out over criticism I rented it.  Sadly, I have to side with the critics, whose judgement about the many flaws in this film is spot-on.  Not since ""Love, Actually""  has there been such a talented cast of A-list actors put to such superficial, sitcommy use.  This often plays like an extended episode of ""Friends Go to Ireland"" and would have done even without the presence of Lisa Kudrow as one of Swank's neglected BFFs. Though there are many pretty views of Ireland and New York respectively, they are as glossy, flat and uninhabited as a postcard.  Hillary Swank is a gifted actress in tough roles, but she decidedly lacks softer qualities of vulnerablity or self-parody, both of which are pretty much obligatory for romantic dramedy heroines.  She tries very, very hard, though and is to be given credit for trying.  She also displays a very passable voice doing Judy Garland and a scene of her doing karaoke shows something of a flair for physical comedy.  The script is unsure whether to lean more heavily toward rom-com fluffiness ala ""13 Going on 30"" or pathos and winds up being an uncomfortable mish-mash of neither.  This film suffers from the same problem that hobbles all From-Beyond-the-Grave love stories: it's impossible to plug the dead spouse into the movie in any way other than flashbacks or contrived sequences where the bereaved talks to a figment in an otherwise empty room.  Though the device of daily letters from beyond the grave could be effective, the fact that they come from a free-wheeling soul who was not known to put pen to paper while he was living is a tad problematic.  Surely footloose musician Gerry might have devised other methods to communicate with his wife . . .songs, perhaps.  The problem for the audience is that we get exactly one scene with Gerry before his abrupt departure, so it's hard to really know What Would Gerry Do?  Director LaGravanese attempts to answer this question with a series of flashbacks that go chronologically backwards, so that near the end of the movie, we have come to the very beginning of Gerry and Holly's relationship.  Unfortunately at this point, LaGravanese commits a Fatal Movie Faux Pas previously seen in ""Laws of Attraction"" by having his protaganists collide in an utterly fantastical Meet Cute on the Roadside in Ireland.  Since such Meet Cutes on the Irish Roadside must hardly ever happen to actual Irish people, what are the chances that every American woman in Ireland on a tourist visa would have a Meet Cute with the likes of Gerard Butler or Pierce Brosnan?  Alas, I had already lost my ability to suspend my disbelief in this film long before this Meet Cute happened.  After a fairly promising start, ""P.S."" falls flatter than an Irish soda bread without the soda.  I give this movie two stars for the gorgeous views of Ireland and the equally gorgeous views of Gerard Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, as well as some great soundtrack numbers.

Some of Gerry's messages force her to go out and spend time with her friends, thereby taking her out of mourning and letting her enjoy everything beautiful about life that she had forgotten about.Indeed, I thought it was a beautiful story. I know some reviewers said it was very predictable, and while you do get the idea that Holly is slowly moving on to bigger and better things, the story is not that obvious otherwise. At times, Holly feels like relapsing and going back to depression; at other times, we find out a surprise about herself or one of her friends.

It was not the romantic comedy that the trailers and reviews led me to believe; it was too dark and depressing.  Instead, ""P.S. I Love You"" is a romantic drama that chronicles the year-long struggle of Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank of ""Million Dollar Baby"") to overcome the death of her husband Gerry (Gerard Butler of ""300"").Holly is constantly complaining and whining that life isn't good enough for her.  Her husband dies of a brain tumor and she's plunged into depression.  Then the letters from Gerry begin arriving.  They urge Holly to continue living her life, pursuing her dreams.  Instead, Holly clings to her dead husband even more.  When the letters finally cease arriving, it is as though he has died again.  All the while I keep hoping she will fall in love with someone, anyone, even the grungy Harry Connick, Jr.  It never happens.  In the last minute of the film, the viewer receives a glimmer of hope that she might have a lasting relationship with a handsome musician living in Ireland.Lisa Kudrow of ""Friends"" and Kathy Bates of ""Titanic"" help round out a great cast.  Kudrow's comic relief was depleted too soon into the movie when she found her beau.  Bates' sour faced character was stern and pious; most of the time, she was dishing out motherly advice.  She never approved of Holly's marriage.  Swank and Butler were too muscular for their roles.  It's quite obvious that they spend a lot of time working out at the gym.Beautiful New York skylines and Irish farmland and a great soundtrack were not enough to hold my interest.  I found myself getting bored.  ""P.S. I Love You"" dragged on and on.  One-hundred and twenty-seven minutes is too long for a romantic comedy.  When Holly received her last letter, I thought, ""Thank the Lord.  It's finally over.""  But her whining and complaining began anew.

1116861,APZC5PRJVM0PY,B000YAA68C,JD,"[4, 4]","I'll start off by saying I do not enjoy melodrama or Hilary Swank in particular very much.  So, I was surprised twice by this movie, which I've watched several times with my wife.The story focuses on Holly (Swank) as she is trying to move past her loss but is still receiving reminders of him that he had arranged to send her before his death from a tumor.  We don't see much of Gerry (Butler) while alive, but we do see him through Holly's memories and in her imagination here and there.  In the course of the movie Holly does come to terms with her loss though it never really resolves if the after-death reminders from him were a help or not.  In the end, you get the impression that they did help her, but in watching the film you can see that there is obvious pain resurrected in her each time she is confronted with them and the places they lead her.As the lead, Hilary Swank completely delivers as Holly.  I found myself laughing and grieving with her and she brings real substance and emotion to the character of Holly.  Gerry isn't present as much, but Gerard Butler gives a solid performance as the sometimes cocky and over-sure Gerry but gives the character charm and sweetness to.  Some of the moments of chemistry between the two were some of the best I've seen in film in a while.  I don't know how they work together when the cameras weren't rolling but they delivered a solid image of your typical married couple here.The supporting characters run the usual gambit of good and bad.  Sometimes necessary to further the plot or breath new life to the story and at other times out of place and jarring with the theme of the story.  I found a few moments where the humor they deliver is hard to take in after the sad tension of the previous scene.  However, the casting was well done with many likable actors.P.S. I Love You ends as you would expect it to and does a fairly good job at resolving Holly and giving her a chance at future happiness.  Although, there is a sadness to the film as well, as the impression you have of Holly and Gerry together is hard to move beyond.  If you have parallels to this scenario in your own lives then I imagine this to be quite touching - for good and bad.Ultimately, I have to recommend the film despite my previous acknowledgment that romantic drama stuff usually isn't my game.  If your girl is in for a sappy flick then you could do worse than P.S.

The story was mostly about Holly and Gerry, and was not the context of her next relationship.2. I worried that his letters would only cause her to hold to his memory all the more, but was pleased to see how they freed her to continue her life.3. Her grieving process was real. At the risk of sounding morbid, I have to say it pleased me to see her go through intense grief. It made her character more real and likable and also gave credit to the strength of their marriage.This is why I only gave it three stars (if I could have given it a rating of 3.5, I would have):1.

Gerard Butler is one of my favorite actors of all time. Actually because of The Phantom of the Opera, he is my favorite actor of all time.  This was one of very few of his that I never seen before so I had to see it.This film is a very, very sad film and it made me cry actually.  The very beginning of the film, you see that Gerard Butler has died and I couldn't believe how quick it was into the film.  Not even ten minutes and he's gone.  I really loved how it showed her grief for him and you could tell how much she really loved him.  He obviously really loved her too to go through the act of having her mother send her all the letters from him which you don't learn it's from her until the end of the film.  I loved all the flashbacks and I really started to cry from that moment when she returns from Ireland and go to her mother and cries and they go to the park and she gets the last letter and has Connick Jr.  read aloud the last letter.  What's written in the last letter is so sad and emotional.To be honest, I never knew before I saw this film that Gerard dies in the beginning.  I never knew the plot and obviously never read the book.  So I was really expecting a romantic comedy and thought they would be together in the end.  But I was wrong and even though it's not what I expected, the fact that this film was able to move me, make me cry and I could relate to how she was in the grieving sense, I highly recommend at least a rental.

Hilary Swank and the rest of the cast were so annoying. The story was stupid, the characters were lame. How could anybody love a chick like Hilary Swank played in this movie? She was annoying and insipid (like she got punched too many times in the head while making that boxing movie). At first I was wondering if maybe her husband was making pretend he was dead just to get away from her, which would have been a smart move on his part and would have made for a much better movie. Even with everything I love included in this movie (Guinness, Ireland, Kathy Bates, The Yankees, Death) it was still so bad that I couldn't wait for it to end. If I wasted my money on this DVD I would use it as a coaster. I hope I never see this movie again. It is the prime example of a chick flick that I hate... and trust me, there are many chick flicks that I do like. Read my reviews if you don't believe me. I gave this movie a fair chance and it failed miserably. It follows the format that really annoys me about these kinds of movies: it throws in some guy stuff to make it seem like it's cool, but it's really just a chick flick trying to keep the men in the audience from running out of the theater.

From the neurotic main character, the crass best friend, to the unreasonable but ultimately loving mom, all the women in this movie are really hard to relate to.

They try to imply complex relationships but in the arguments I always end up siding with the guys because the women ""don't know what they want"" (as stated by female protagonist).

You know why I don't want children yet, Gerry, she screams, it's because I don't want to bring them up in this tiny lower east side apartment, where I would be having to change their diapers on the windowsills because this place is so small there's not even room to turn around.  In this opening scene I lost all faith in the movie, since the apartment they are fighting in is a fantastically large 3,500 square feet place with views on every wall of every room and plus, it's decorated like she's a staging contest winner.  I know it's a convention of the movies that every New York apartment, no matter how opulent and grand, is supposed to be tiny and unfit for humans, but this really takes the cake.  If you're going to make your PLOT TURN on how awful and small a LES apartment is, why don't you show one?  Don't show something that looks like Krystle and Alexis could both live there and never bump into each other for a week.  How idiotic, how far removed from real life.  Basically you'd have to have an income of $750,000 yearly to afford the apartment that most of the action takes place in.  And yet Swank and Butler, appealing actors of course, are supposed to be barely making ends meet.The script does manage (barely) to explain away why Swank is always dressed in fabulous Marc Jacobs originals.  She buys them on EBAY, she claims, as though that means they would cost only pennies.I'm sure much of the movie ended up on the cutting room floor.  All of James Marsters' scenes for example, and most of the scenes that inveigled Lisa Kudrow enough to sign on, for the movie we have makes her look to be a one dimensional tease.  She does look exquisite in a Marc Jacobs wedding dress, posed high on a grey carpeted revolving disk in the middle of a bridal salon.You could sort of see where the movie was going, and that's okay, but there came a time where I longed for one more twist.  Here are a few that I dreamed up.  At the end it would be revealed that Hilary Swank had also died of a brain tumor quite early on, too; or another ending where it was revealed that she had actually been married to Jeffrey Dean Morgan and that Gerard Butler was alive and singing ""Fairytale of New York"" to her in real time.Who was the actress playing Swank's sister who came from Australia?

1116882,AJLYAY1G5Z8GE,B000YAA68C,"Khaled Altaher ""Khaled""","[4, 4]","Great film by all means. Very romantic and sad at the same time.Its about an American girl who was married to an Irish guy (Jerry) and they were both so much in love. Then, at the age of 35 he passed away from brain tumor.Their relationship didn't end at that point. Before he died he prepared to her many letters that were planned to be sent in future dates. Letters asking her to sing at the Karoake (which she feared), reminding her of their beautiful moments together, planning trips for her with her friends, bringing her back to the place where they first met, and asking her to move on and fall in love with someone else.She couldn't move on because she can't love anyone besides Jerry. She felt lonely many times. Her father left her and her mom at the age of 14, which made her promise herself to not be with any guy ever. Then she met Jerry who was a great man, but unfrotunately he died. She kept asking her self, why? What's the point?In the end after facing the sad reality, she decided to move on. Actually, she probably will fall in love with that Irish singer (another guy) she met after Jerry died. We don't really know because the movie ended when she met him again in Ireland.Quite a great film. I like it so much because at last I see a romantic movie that glorifies love between two married couple. All the other films describe love of unrelated couple, but this one was different.Even though its sad, it teaches us the importance of being able to go one. People don't need to collapse when they lose someone they love. They need to know that this is life, and even if their loved ones have died, they are still alive in their hearts.Wonderful movie, thumbs up",5,A lot of respect for this movie..,1234396800,"02 12, 2009",2009,1681,"['Great', 'film', 'means', 'Very', 'romantic', 'sad', 'same', 'time.Its', 'American', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'Irish', 'guy', 'Jerry', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'Then', 'age', '35', 'passed', 'away', 'brain', 'tumor.Their', 'relationship', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'point', 'died', 'prepared', 'many', 'letters', 'were', 'planned', 'be', 'sent', 'future', 'dates', 'Letters', 'asking', 'sing', 'Karoake', 'feared', 'reminding', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'together', 'planning', 'trips', 'friends', 'bringing', 'back', 'place', 'where', 'first', 'met', 'asking', 'move', 'fall', 'love', 'someone', 'else.She', 'could', ""n't"", 'move', 'ca', ""n't"", 'love', 'anyone', 'Jerry', 'felt', 'lonely', 'many', 'times', 'father', 'left', 'mom', 'age', '14', 'made', 'promise', 'not', 'be', 'guy', 'ever', 'Then', 'met', 'Jerry', 'who', 'was', 'great', 'man', 'unfrotunately', 'died', 'kept', 'asking', 'self', 'why', 'What', 'point', 'end', 'facing', 'sad', 'reality', 'decided', 'move', 'Actually', 'probably', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'Irish', 'singer', 'guy', 'met', 'Jerry', 'died', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'movie', 'ended', 'when', 'met', 'again', 'Ireland.Quite', 'great', 'film', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'last', 'see', 'romantic', 'movie', 'glorifies', 'love', 'two', 'married', 'couple', 'other', 'films', 'describe', 'love', 'unrelated', 'couple', 'one', 'was', 'different.Even', 'sad', 'importance', 'being', 'able', 'go', 'one', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'collapse', 'when', 'lose', 'someone', 'love', 'need', 'know', 'life', 'even', 'loved', 'ones', 'have', 'died', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'hearts.Wonderful', 'movie', 'up']",P.S.

1116883,A1H6P9THIMDJOS,B000YAA68C,"kristin724 ""kristin724""","[4, 5]","I really need to stop watching romantic comedies at 3 a.m. My last gander was the 2007 chick flick P.S. I Love You, starring Oscar winner Hillary Swank and 300 hunk Gerard Butler. Why do I bother?Holly (Swank) and Gerry (Butler) live in a small New York apartment and argue like normal couples, but they truly have a great life and love at heart. When Gerry dies from a brain tumor, Holly struggles with his death despite help from her family and friends. Shortly thereafter, on her 30th birthday, Holly begins to receive predated letters from Gerry. These treasures help her remember the good times, make new experiences, and find herself again.She has had many an out there role, from The Next Karate Kid to Boys Don't Cry, but I wonder what it was that drew Hillary Swank to this role. Holly is by no means a pretty part. For some reason the character dresses like an idiot, and there's a lot of crying and why questions ala Nancy Kerrigan and the whole knee bashing thing. I can see the emotion in the grief and overcoming the death of a loved one, but for personal reasons alone, not from Swank's trying. I don't know what I'd do without my husband. Do I care if Holly gets over Gerry? Not really. She's given plenty of opportunity to do so, and after chance after chance, not only did I not care, but I wanted to smack Holly to her senses. Why Hillary, why?P.S. I Love You was hyped largely as the next big thing after Gerard Butler's success in 300. I understand his not wanting to be typecast, and his work prior to 300 was quite diverse, from Dracula 2000 to The Phantom of the Opera. I just find this film of all the choices, to be so...weird. Some girls may be charmed by all the romance and such, yadda yadda, but otherwise, this is a very unflattering role. His singing is wrong here, and there isn't an Irish actor out there to fill our Irish onscreen Gerry's shoes? Not only is the whole `dead Gerry' and Gerry Butler vibe a little creepy, but he disappears halfway through the film-before the last letter arrives. I don't get it. Butler has one scene before the opening credits, then spends the rest of the film in flashbacks or as figments of Holly's imagination. It's as if the performance technically doesn't exist. Star Trek fans complain if an entire episode is a dream or a big reset button. It's not as if the ghost of Holly's dead husband is really haunting her, that would be worthwhile I think, ala The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. It would have to be funny, not serious, Ghost cornered that. I just don't see the appeal of a film that turned out to be a complete misstep for both leads. Why Gerry why?Not only have the two leads been unfortunately miscast, but the absolutely stunning supporting cast of P.S. I Love You has been completely wasted. Oscar winner Kathy Bates (Misery) receives her token obligatory weepy scenes as Holly's mom Patricia, and Gina Gershon (Bound) and James Marsters (Spike, People! Spike!) disappear from the film with no explanation whatsoever. We get a tacked on reunion with Lisa Kudrow (Friends) and a cop out at Yankee Stadium with Harry Connick, Jr.(Copycat). I found myself more interested in these fine supporting players and their complex relationships, but their trials and troubles are dropped in favor of Holly's obvious and typical story. The eclectic mix has the comedic and dramatic-and heck musical-talent needed, but it's never used by writer Steven Rogers (Hope Floats) and director Richard LaGravenese (The Fisher King, Freedom Writers, and The Bridges of Madison County).It's not woeful leads and misused support, however, that undoes P.S. I Love You- it's the whole dang story from author Cecelia Ahem. Maybe the movie took its liberties from the source novel, but I'm certainly not rushing down the street to Borders to get the book, that's for damn sure. The bemoaning of Holly just goes on and on. As I said, grief is something everyone can relate to, but enough with the letters already. They are too obvious and convenient. The first message is on a tape recorder. Why aren't all the others? In this day and age, Gerry couldn't videotape himself and email it to Holly everyday? How is she really expected to get over her dead husband if new information and good memories of him are technically coming from him after death?Gerry and Holly are so poor, but he can plan elaborate bar trips and vacays to Ireland? And all this while dying of a brain tumor over the course of one year? The soul searching of what grief can do to one person is undone by the unrealistic nature of the story's plan. Never mind the horrid soundtrack and all that omigod chick stuff about turning thirty, marriage, divorce, babies, and looks. And after all this, how does Holly get on with her life? By designing shoes! Could you alienate the male audience more? I can't believe guys wrote and directed this.Fans of the cast will tune in for P.S. I Love You, but I don't think it will be a Gerry dream for the ladies or a tour de force for Swank fans. The DVD supposedly has more scenes and interviews with Ahern-something I would normally find interesting, but I don't think its worth the full price of the disc. Unless you are a big chick flick fan, please avoid. Fans of the individual cast are better off finding clips on youtube.",2,Don't love you,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,5281,"['really', 'need', 'stop', 'watching', 'romantic', 'comedies', '3', 'a.m.',

It was a nice departure from the regular happy-ever-after tear jerkers we normally get from the studios these days.  Unfortunately, there really wasn't a story. Well, not a believable one, anyway.Hillary Swank was horribly miscast.  She is not the least bit feminine, and I think the movie makers realized this because they spent far too much time having her prance around in her undergarments trying to convince us otherwise.  She needs to eat a meal or two!  Her lisp (or overbite) was very distracting and it was an awkward performance.  Most of the time her character was whining and complaining. It was very hard to believe that her husband Jerry (the gorgeous Mr. Butler) would have ever been attracted to her.There was a secondary story involving Harry Connick, Jr. that showed some promise.  He did a fine job of portraying a cynic, burned one too many times by the opposite sex.  His love connection with Swank's character is painfully wasted in the end.  There was a very disappointing scene in which they kiss and decide it feels like they were kissing their respective siblings.

To help Holly deal with her grief, Gerry arranges for a series of special gifts and letters to be delivered to Holly after his death. With the help of her family and a few girlfriends, Holly begin to lift herself out of her depression and embrace the chapters of her life that have yet to come.This is a sweet story that's romantic and incredibly bittersweet. The movie includes many flashbacks that depict the life Holly and Gerry shared together, which are touching and allow the audience to connect with Holly and feel her pain. There are also several beautiful sequences shot in Ireland and a strong group of supporting cast members. Obviously, so much of the film's events are incredibly unrealistic, and I also didn't care at all for Holly's relationship with the oddball David (Harry Connick, Jr.), but fortunately the film resolved that subplot very well toward the end of the film.

1116908,A3APPKALUGB2GT,B000YAA68C,Michelle888,"[5, 5]","Gerry and Holly married while they were young and free of worries. Years later they feel the pressure as the reality of marriage and all it entails kicks in. The scene starts off with Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hillary Swank) emerging from the subway walking towards their home. The couple is arguing about their different views on life with emphasis on children, money and getting their dream home. The argument heats up to the point where Gerry storms out and quickly rushes back in and they fell in each other's arms and make wild, passionate love.The credit rolls in and the next scene is that of Gerry's wake. The viewers are told that he has died of brain tumour at the young age of 35. The next three weeks see a decline in Holly as we see her spiralling down, crying and watching black and white movies, suffering from hallucinations of her late husband. Then as she sings along to Judy Garland, her mother (Kathy Bates) and best friends (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon) walk in reminding her that it was her 30th birthday. They open a cake from Gerry and Holly thinks it's a prank until they play the accompanying tape recorder where Gerry tells her of his plan for her, how he has written letters which will arrive on various occasions. Those letters become a source of strength for her as she follows his advice and finds herself doing things she would never have thought herself. While Gerry has planned for the letters to serve as a guide for Holly to figure out what she wants in life, they serve as a way for the viewers to find out more about the couple and their beginnings.The tasks include a trip to Ireland where we are treated to a spectacular view of the countryside and Ireland's splendor come to life. Here we see Holly meet another Irishman who turns out to be an old friend of Gerry's. We find out about her first meeting with Gerry and it is one of those moments that make a romantic movie truly heartmelting. Hillary Swank portrays the grieving and lost widow quite well and the supporting characters were good and added some much needed laughter.  The highlight for me though was Gerard Butler who was just truly charming. I think I am now officially a drooling fan. That smile is enough to weaken any woman's knees and any woman would understand how Holly could have fallen in love with a perfect stranger. I thought he was great as King Leonidas in300 (Full Screen Edition)yelling out ""This is Sparta!"" in his almost naked glory. But now he has been elevated to real sweetheart material after seeing him in this movie. And God I love a man who can sing.P.S. I LOVE YOU, while far from perfect, is more than your average run-of-the-mill romantic movie.  While I find that the whole letters after death thing lacked plausibility (the cynical may even find it creepy), the idea is simply clever. It provided the sentimentalism that is certain to leave many readers teary and satisfied with the film.",4,P.S.

Ever sincethat first viewing, I've been hooked. I laugh every time, I cry everytime, I sit in awe every time, and enjoy each and every minute of thislovely film, which I have since purchased on DVD.What's to love? The movie seamlessly blends the story of the maincharacters and their past with little confusion. The editing is almostperfect. The cast is brilliant. Highest marks go to Gerard Butler andJeffrey Dean Morgan for their mastery of the dialect and their unbelievablegood looks and charm, as well as Harry Connick Jr., who nails the part ofthe goofy, socially-challenged bartender. Though not a ravishing beauty,Hillary Swank's performance is sympathetic and convincing, and LisaKudrow and Gina Gershon are superb as her supportive sidekicks. KathyBates also delivers a seamless performance as the grieving widow's mother.What else is there to love? The movie's beautiful scenery. New York and gloriousIreland are themselves characters in this lovely tale. I am also very partialto the movie's soundtrack, the theme of which is bittersweet and romantic. Mostof all, you will love the film's whimsical and lighthearted approach to themesthat universally touch us all:  themes of love and loss, anger and confusion,friendship and family, hope and despair. The storyline may be somewhatimplausible and there may be no husband on earth as charming and quiescent asGerard Butler's Gerry, but the mere suggestion that a man like he exists and thatthe love he shares with Holly trancends his tragic death is worth the price of admission.You don't have to be a ""chick"" or a sentimental sap to enjoy this movie.

In the beginning, I felt bad for Gerard Butler's character who was engaging and adorable but who had to deal with a bitchy, self-centered, unreasonable wife.  Then for the rest of the movie the grief process was so painful to watch.  Anyone that has suffered through a painful loss in the past will identify with the wife's pain.  The efforts of friends and family to help were relatively useless and not that enjoyable to watch either.  I disliked the twist at the end, and the assumption that William was the guy for her because he had a nice body was sort of disgusting.  Here she had just gone through a profound grief experience and she is supposed to be all happy again because she falls into bed with a nice-looking guy.  Please.

I don't watch many regular television programs sohave never seen some of the supporting cast and their trademark 'acts.'I have never read the novel, P.S, I Love You. Or any other Ahernwritings. Never have seen any of the actors except Hilary Swank, GerardButler and Kathy Bates. I don't know anything about walk-up apartmentsin New York. (Seemed to bug some people.) I'm not an 'expert' on Irishaccents.I caught the film for the second time 12/30 at the 10:35 a.m. showing;there was an amazing crowd for a Sunday morning. The projection wasperfect. No microphones (complaints on some boards) on view. The soundwas great. That end song over the credits is a winner! And I loved itmore that I did the first time on the opening Friday morn, the 21st.Holly is a real person, imperfect and annoying at times. Hilary Swankis perfect. Those who want a 'babyface"" child/woman to play Holly arenot living in the real world. There are more look-a-likes for Hilarythan the usual cookie-cutter cute young things Hollywood usually casts.And Hilary has the chops to make us understand this childish woman andhow she starts the healing and growing up, with her Gerry's memory tohelp.I loved Lisa Kudrows questions to potentials. Very funny. I lovedHolly's quirky sister and thought she brought energy and sunshine toher scenes. The boat scene is clich&eacute;' but funny all the same.I still say the ballpark scene was not needed. They could have cut itand the expense, and had the reading of the letter as voice-over.Daniel and Holly 'were over' in the restaurant, and the audience knowsit. Daniel is an interesting ""other man"" and a new type. Moreinteresting than usual. But did anyone really think they would end uptogether? Not me.Bates is always good, but I just don't see that her part is 'wonderful'as others keep saying. It's a part Bates can do in her sleep. TheMother had never reconciled to the marriage and seemed waspish. Hollyhad to overlook her disapproval while trying to find her way with herhusband.I wonder how many scenes with James Marstars and Gina Gershon were lefton the cutting room floor. They were hardly in the film.And Jeffrey Dean Morgan, although good looking in a grinny-goofy way,hardly has any lines to say. And they are one-note. So not a greatimpression.The cinematography is gorgeous, from the streets of New York to theIrish countryside.Our audience today clapped when the 'Mustang Sally"" scene started. Moreenergy and excitement there than in all the rest of the film. GerryButler is Mr. Wonderful. Singing, flirting, great body language, and adelicious deep kiss, at last. *sigh* I've upgraded my rating to a 9from a 7.Postcript: I didn't read this book and I have promised myself that Iwill never buy a book thinking I will see it on film. Never happens. Ihave promised myself I will not see every preview and teaser of a filmbefore I go to the theater.The previews of PSILY were clips chopped up from 5 to 10 seconds anddid not show what the scenes they were from were about. I went thinkingI was seeing quite a different film, just from all the clips we wereable to see online and on TV. My first viewing was clouded by thatfact. I did not see what the preview seemed to say I should be seeing.From now on I will go in like I did for ""Phantom Of The Opera"" -knowing nothing, never having seen a preview. But I knew I loved themusic.Or last years ""The Departed."" I had never even heard of it and wentbecause I wanted to see the ""300"" preview on a big screen. But I lovedit.This has taught me a lesson. I've seen one preview of ""Nims Island"" -the next Butler film, out in April, and love what I see. Don't want toread the book. I'll not be watching or reading about the film. Don'twant any more information than I have right now. That way, it is justme and what's on the screen - and that's what it's all about.

1116917,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B000YAA68C,mk,"[7, 9]","Ok, I like Hilary, Gerard, Kathy, Lisa, and Harry.  These are great, watchable actors, and I was so excited to see this movie.  That's problem number one- too much hype and expectations.  My little voice kept saying: ""There's something amiss when the main actor(Gerard Butler) is essentially dead.""  Especially for a kind of romantic comedy.  My little voice was somewhat right, but thank goodness for Gerard!  The first half of the movie drags, and you wait and wait only for him to return, and when he does, it's great!The second problem is I read the reviews beforehand, and it was so up and down in opinions that the voice yelled at me again, ""Something's afoul.""  It turns out there's an edge to the movie's demeanor.  For example, Harry Connick, who should star as a wonderful lead and potential romantic type, is made into a bit of a buffoon, and you're suppose to love him for it?  In one scene, Hilary pulls him into a closet.  He tells her that he has this 'rude syndrome', that he can't filter his words, and that his girlfriend ran away with another woman, and that he was reduced to seeing hookers but now the money's run out.  Ok.  Gosh, I hope you've got enough dough leftover for your HIV tests.Frankly, the best part of the movie takes place in Ireland.  The scenes with her girlfriends are hilarious, especially in the boat.  Now that's more like the fun escapism one expects in a 'romantic comedy'; however, *SPOILER ALERT* she quickly jumps in bed with another Irishman.  Well, her friends urged her on, and besides, she's lonely and horny and hasn't been with a man for a little while.  He turns out to have been ""Best mates"" with Gerard's character.  ""Hey, we share everything,"" the new guy says to her after the fact.  Adding, ""Oh,I didn't mean it like that.""  Well, how did you mean it?  And gee, I hope you used good American condoms.*END ALERT*She returns home to New York and the finale is definitely more satisfying, but to get there has, at times, been a sour process.Gerard Butler shines in any movie, anytime; Hilary Swank is fine; although, here she must portray a difficult character, who's scattered, flighty and plain annoying at times(Why does she hate her apartment? Her designer E-BAY clothes?  Her all loving, adoring man?) and also, she deals with a script that flounders.  Harry Connick just needs a decent role.  The supporting cast deliver their usual, typical performances.Whew, so did I enjoy the flick?  I don't know.  I'm not eager to see it again.  I guess I could jump through, and play the scenes I like.  Or not.My third problem is that I keep imaging a story about a somewhat immature, insecure and opinionated American woman who travels to Ireland and meets a freewheeling Gerard Butler-type and sparks fly, good and bad, but she's not sure what she wants and then a handsome, stud of a Harry Connick-type Amercian shows up and really confuses the whole mess.  And it all plays out to the background of the Emerald Isle and the Big Apple.  Gimmie.

I read the book that this movie was based on a few years ago, and though the movie differed significantly from the book in some key areas, I found myself enjoying it.Here's the skinny: Young Holly is married to Gerry, an Irish musician. The two live in a cramped walk-up apartment in New York, and they are trying to save some money and ""make a plan"" to start their family.Reality intervenes. Gerry is diagnosed with a brain tumor and passes away. Holly is adrift in grief. Then, on her 30th birthday, a cake and a small tape recorder arrive at her doorstep. It's a message from Gerry. Apparently, Gerry planned these occasional messages to her for the first year after his death.Each message gives Holly an assignment - buy a bedside lamp, go out with her girlfriends, take a vacation, find a better job. The assignments are Gerry's way of making sure that Holly's life goes on without him. (Sweet, no?)I thought that Swank did a good job in this film, making a sometimes inscrutable character likable and warm. Butler was wonderful as Gerry, and there was a fabulous (all too brief) performance by Jeffrey Dean Morgan that practically had me weak in the knees. Harry Connick Jr. played Daniel, Holly's long-suffering friend, pretty well, too. (Oh, and Holly's clothes were really fun! Kudos to the costumer on that one.)To recap - this is not a tour de force. This movie will not change your life or even make you think about it that much. But it will entertain you, and you may have to grab a Kleenex for some of the scenes.

But, in a film where she doesn't die by the end, Swank shines as always as she plays a woman who, in the wake of her beloved husband's sudden death, must learn to pick up the pieces and move on in her life.  As I've said, Swank did as great as ever here and this change of genre was surprising but ultimately welcome.  Did anyone beside me see Phoebe from ""Friends?  Yes, I know Lisa Kudrow was in the movie, but unfortunately, she's Phoebe.  So seeing her as a female version of Joey was just weird...and sometimes a bit forced.  But she and the rest of the cast were still pretty good throughout the film.  Even Harry Connick, Jr. showed some life here and there.  And Gerard Butler left us with a memorable performance as Swank's now-dead husband, making us miss him all the more.  My only wish is that we'd seen more of Kathy Bates on the grounds that she's just awesome.  My biggest praise goes for the ending as it did not go the way we all thought it would.  Oh, there were plenty of hints towards the ending every one of these movies moves towards, but there's a nice, and completely believable, twist at the end that leaves us with as much, if not a bit more, satisfaction as if a stereotypical ending had been chosen.  This is a fine film.  Enjoy.

1116939,A2VTUTUTT5SO0Z,B000YAA68C,"Rai Aren ""co-author of Secret of the Sands & ...","[3, 3]","I actually had low expectations for this movie, and I will admit that I was mainly interested in it because of Gerard Butler - he is beee-yooo-ti-ful... :)Also, Hilary Swank is a wonderful actress, very talented, a double Oscar winner, so I figured, I would check this movie out. I am also not usually much of a chick flick watcher (even though I am a chick), I'm usually a big action adventure movie fan, intense dramas, that type of thing. I expected to have this movie on in the background, not really pay attention to it, work on other things, and only look up when Gerard Butler was on screen. So, from that perspective, this movie was a very big, very pleasant surprise.Pretty much from the get-go, this movie grabbed my attention and lo and behold I didn't do any work at all while it was on (I tried a couple of times, but then I just had to rewind something I missed, so I happily gave up). A big part of this was the fact that I expected predictable dialogue, and a predictable story-line. A big credit to this movie belongs in the fact that it had very sharp writing, it actually dealt with things that seemed real-life. Of course there are lines here & there in the movie that are ""hollywood"", but for the most part, this movie has a lot of heart.HUGE, HUGE, HUGE credit for this movie's heart & soul must go to Hilary Swank & Kathy Bates. These two ladies do an INCREDIBLE job in their roles, they imbue them with so much authenticity, I was really taken aback. In fact so much so, this movie actually had me crying repeatedly through it (thank heavens I didn't see this movie in public, that would have been very embarrassing & I would have most certainly run out of kleenex). Plus, it had me laughing in between! What an emotional ride this movie was, and I was somewhat prepared for ""heart-string pulling"" because I knew the premise of the movie.In fact, it has been days since I watched this movie, and I keep thinking about it. It moved me, not only with the emotional journey of Hilary's character, what she learned, how she grew, but because it also makes you think about your own life. I find myself reflecting on my own relationships, appreciating them more, it really touched me. It also has a secondary theme about Hilary's character trying to find happiness in what she does for a living - lessons in finding your passion, and stop doing what doesn't make you happy, what you may hate, for a living.This movie also has a measure of unexpected outcomes, which is a breath of fresh air. So many times we can predict what is going to happen, then when a movie doesn't do that, it's such a delight. This movie has lovely journeys of forgiveness, selfishness, confusion, what are our lives all about, who knows, but we keep putting one foot in front of the other.I highly recommend this movie as a worthy watch. I loved it. And I want to visit Ireland soooo bad now!!! My heart is still tender, from the highs, the lows, the questions this movie raised. Hilary - wow, you are amazing in this role...I hope you will get the recognition you deserve for it.Rai Aren",5,A really wonderful movie,1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,3082,"['actually', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'movie', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'mainly', 'interested', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'beee-yooo-ti-ful', 'Also', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'very', 'talented', 'double', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'figured', 'would', 'check', 'movie', 'am', 'also', 'not', 'usually', 'much', 'chick', 'flick', 'watcher', 'even', 'am', 'chick', ""'m"", 'usually', 'big', 'action', 'adventure', 'movie', 'fan', 'intense', 'dramas', 'type', 'thing', 'expected', 'have', 'movie', 'background', 'not', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'work', 'other', 'things', 'only', 'look', 'up', 'when', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'was', 'screen', 'So', 'perspective', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'big', 'very', 'pleasant', 'surprise.Pretty', 'much', 'get-go', 'movie', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'lo', 'behold', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'work', 'was', 'tried', 'couple', 'times', 'then', 'just', 'had', 'rewind', 'something', 'missed', 'happily', 'gave', 'up', 'big', 'part', 'was', 'fact', 'expected', 'predictable', 'dialogue', 'predictable', 'story-line', 'big', 'credit', 'movie', 'fact', 'had', 'very', 'sharp', 'writing', 'actually', 'things', 'seemed', 'real-life', 'course', 'are', 'lines', 'here', 'there', 'movie', 'are', 'hollywood', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart.HUGE', 'HUGE', 'HUGE', 'credit', 'movie', 'heart', 'soul', 'must', 'go', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'two', 'ladies', 'do', 'INCREDIBLE', 'job', 'roles', 'imbue', 'so', 'much', 'authenticity', 'was', 'really', 'taken', 'aback', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'movie', 'actually', 'had', 'crying', 'repeatedly', 'thank', 'heavens', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'public', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'embarrassing', 'would', 'have', 'most', 'certainly', 'run', 'out', 'kleenex', 'had', 'laughing', 'What', 'emotional', 'ride', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'somewhat', 'prepared', 'heart-string', 'pulling', 'knew', 'premise', 'movie.In', 'fact', 'been', 'days', 'watched', 'movie', 'keep', 'thinking', 'moved', 'not', 'only', 'emotional', 'journey', 'Hilary', 'character', 'what', 'learned', 'how', 'grew', 'also', 'think', 'own', 'life', 'find', 'reflecting', 'own', 'relationships', 'appreciating', 'more', 'really', 'touched', 'also', 'secondary', 'theme', 'Hilary', 'character', 'trying', 'find', 'happiness', 'what', 'living', 'lessons', 'finding', 'passion', 'stop', 'doing', 'what', ""n't"", 'make', 'happy', 'what', 'may', 'hate', 'living.This', 'movie', 'also', 'measure', 'unexpected', 'outcomes', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'So', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'predict', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'then', 'when', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'such', 'delight', 'movie', 'lovely', 'journeys', 'forgiveness', 'selfishness', 'confusion', 'what', 'are', 'lives', 'who', 'keep', 'putting', 'one', 'foot', 'front', 'other.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'worthy', 'watch', 'loved', 'want', 'visit', 'Ireland', 'soooo', 'bad', 'now', 'heart', 'still', 'tender', 'highs', 'lows', 'questions', 'movie', 'raised', 'Hilary', 'wow', 'are', 'amazing', 'role', 'hope', 'will', 'get', 'recognition', 'deserve', 'it.Rai', 'Aren']",P.S.

1116947,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B000YAA68C,R. Kyle,"[135, 142]","The story begins with a fight. Holly (Swank) is running up a seemingly endless  flight of stairs with Gerry (Butler) in hot pursuit.  He's apologizing, but like a typical male, he's really not quite sure what he did wrong--he just wants to make up and not sleep in the bathtub.Nine years' marriage and they don't have a lot to show--no kids, no careers, and only a five flight walkup.  But, it's obvious that Holly and Gerry love each other very much.The next scene is Gerry's wake.  It's a bittersweet affair--and I confess to laughing when I heard the ironic ""Fairytale of New York"" (Gerry's favorite song) played and sung to by his priest.A few weeks' later, the letters begin.  While the film only shows Gerry's life and Holly's impressions of his 'ghost', we realize he'd understood his cancer would take him and planned to help Holly get through it past the grave.  His letters encourage her to get out, sing Karaoke, even go to Ireland.  Those missives literally help her find her dreams and go on with her life.""PS I love you"" is what I expected--and more. The cast, scenery, and especially the music all fit well together to elicit tears--and yes, occasional laughter.Gerard Butler is fabulous as always.  He's one of the best new actors around and I hope to see him for many years to come. I didn't expect that he could sing--and he does an excellent job on ""Galway Girls.""In my opinion, Hillary Swank is the best part of the film.  She's not your typical Hollywood ingenue.  She's sometimes awkward, she doesn't always look perfect, and yet her ability to convey emotions from the highs to the lows very impressive.  When she comes home from the funeral alone, picks up her cell phone and just keeps calling her home phone to hear Gerry's voice over and over on the answering machine literally brought me to tears.Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the big teddy bear Billy Gallagher was also great.  You've seen him before if you watched ""Grey's Anatomy"" playing Denny Duquette. I'm very glad to see him getting silver screen roles.

1116950,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000YAA68C,Robert Moore,"[4, 6]","This film is all about having your emotions manipulated.  If you want a good cry, if you want a film to unabashedly try to fill you with very specific emotions, then this is the film for you.  While I will acknowledge that any film is going to try to provoke a response, not many will be as unsubtle and as unapolegetic as this one.  In fact, this is all about the feeling, not at all about the story.  The only point of the story is to make the viewer experience and engage in certain emotions.  If you don't want to go along, then many parts of the film are going to be agonizing.  And you could well believe that this is one of the least artful, most clumsily produced films of recent years.  To be honest, I'm definitely not among the former.  This film simply didn't move me.  All its tactics were too obvious and heavy-handed for me to want to go along.  On the other hand, it wasn't an utter piece of crap either.  If we could give half stars I would give it 2.5.  All in all, I don't regret having seen it, but neither do I feel that it has in any way enriched my life.I know this was based on a popular book.  I'm an obsessive reader, but quite frankly my reading all goes int other directions.  So I couldn't care less whether it does or does not remain faithful to a book that I will never read.  What are the movie's pluses and minuses?  The minuses first.  As I said above, it really doesn't have much of a story.  Or rather, the story isn't the point.  This is a mush fest.  I just didn't feel the mush.  Most of the film left me cold and disinterested.  The artifice was too obvious, the attempts to manipulate too blatant, the nuances pretty much nonexistent.  In other words, at the very heart of the film there was pretty much nothing.  The whole film struck me as hollow.The pluses, however, are many.  Even in an age of great film soundtracks, this one stood out.  Over the opening credits they played my favorite song off the great Camera Obscura album LET'S GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY, ""Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken.""  Then at the wake that opened the post-credits they played the great Pogues song from IF I SHOULD FALL FROM GRACE WITH GOD, ""Fairytale of New York.""  And the music stayed interested after that.  OK, the soundtrack is superficial compared with the main story, but suferficialities can keep a film interesting even when it is at core a failure.Visually the film was eye candy throughout, especially when it got to the scenes in Ireland.  Again, this won't substitute for a good story, but it gives you something to do when the story fails to show up.  I defy anyone not to be impressed by the verdant landscapes show in the scene where Gerry and Holly meet for the first time.Finally, while the story isn't up to their talents, the film features a strong and interesting cast.  I've always wondered why Hillary Swank hasn't had a more interesting career than she has had.  She's had a couple of Oscar quality roles, but the quality drops off sharply after that.  Perhaps she has been hurt by the fact that in her two biggest films she played a female transsexual trying to pass for male and a boxer.  Hopefully a girlie role like this one will expand the range of roles made available to her.  Gerard Butler plays Gerry.  His career is an interesting one as well.  He's been in a surprising variety of films, but big stardom has eluded him.  He seems poised to make a leap to the A list, especially after the success of 300.  I was delighted to see James Marsters as Gerry's business partner (though it was interesting that later, when Gerry's letter was telling Holly that she needed a job that she could love, but that ""vampire slayer"" was one of them, that in her Slayer poster there were no BUFFY references -- still it was nice to see Marsters in a non-SF or fantasy role).  Kathy Bates, Dean Winters, Lisa Kudrow, Gina Gershon, Harry Connick Jr., and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.So, the conjunction of a lot of nice surface elements results in a watchable film.  Mind you, a lot of people are going to love this.  They won't object to the emotional manipulation and the cloying sentimentality that is this film's raison d'etre.  I did object, so as a result it had very minimal appeal.  But it did have a little.  And as yet another vampire on BUFFY put it (not James Marster's Spike, but The Master), ""Sometimes a little is enough.""",2,Not awful (2.5 stars) but cloyingly sentimental and manipulative,1210464000,"05 11, 2008",2008,4371,"['film', 'having', 'emotions', 'manipulated', 'want', 'good', 'cry', 'want', 'film', 'unabashedly', 'try', 'fill', 'very', 'specific', 'emotions', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'acknowledge', 'film', 'going', 'try', 'provoke', 'response', 'not', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'unsubtle', 'as', 'unapolegetic', 'one', 'fact', 'feeling', 'not', 'story', 'only', 'point', 'story', 'make', 'viewer', 'experience', 'engage', 'certain', 'emotions', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'along', 'then', 'many', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'agonizing', 'could', 'well', 'believe', 'one', 'least', 'artful', 'most', 'clumsily', 'produced', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'be', 'honest', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'not', 'former', 'film', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'tactics', 'were', 'too', 'obvious', 'heavy-handed', 'want', 'go', 'along', 'other', 'hand', 'was', ""n't"", 'utter', 'piece', 'crap', 'could', 'give', 'half', 'stars', 'would', 'give', '2.5', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'having', 'seen', 'do', 'feel', 'way', 'enriched', 'life.I', 'know', 'was', 'based', 'popular', 'book', ""'m"", 'obsessive', 'reader', 'quite', 'frankly', 'reading', 'int', 'other', 'directions', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'not', 'remain', 'faithful', 'book', 'will', 'never', 'read', 'What', 'are', 'movie', 'pluses', 'minuses', 'minuses', 'first', 'said', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'story', 'rather', 'story', ""n't"", 'point', 'mush', 'fest', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'mush', 'Most', 'film', 'left', 'cold', 'disinterested', 'artifice', 'was', 'too', 'obvious', 'attempts', 'manipulate', 'too', 'blatant', 'nuances', 'pretty', 'much', 'nonexistent', 'other', 'words', 'very', 'heart', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'whole', 'film', 'struck', 'hollow.The', 'pluses', 'however', 'are', 'many', 'Even', 'age', 'great', 'film', 'soundtracks', 'one', 'stood', 'out', 'opening', 'credits', 'played', 'favorite', 'song', 'great', 'Camera', 'Obscura', 'album', 'LET', 'GET', 'OUT', 'THE', 'COUNTRY', 'Lloyd', ""'m"", 'Ready', 'Be', 'Heartbroken', 'Then', 'wake', 'opened', 'post-credits', 'played', 'great', 'Pogues', 'song', 'IF', 'SHOULD', 'FALL', 'FROM', 'GRACE', 'WITH', 'GOD', 'Fairytale', 'New', 'York', 'music', 'stayed', 'interested', 'OK', 'soundtrack', 'superficial', 'compared', 'main', 'story', 'suferficialities', 'can', 'keep', 'film', 'interesting', 'even', 'when', 'core', 'failure.Visually', 'film', 'was', 'eye', 'candy', 'especially', 'when', 'got', 'scenes', 'Ireland', 'Again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'substitute', 'good', 'story', 'something', 'do', 'when', 'story', 'show', 'up', 'defy', 'anyone', 'not', 'be', 'impressed', 'verdant', 'show', 'scene', 'where', 'Gerry', 'Holly', 'meet', 'first', 'time.Finally', 'story', ""n't"", 'up', 'talents', 'film', 'strong', 'interesting', 'cast', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wondered', 'why', 'Hillary', 'Swank', ""n't"", 'had', 'more', 'interesting', 'career', 'had', 'had', 'couple', 'Oscar', 'quality', 'roles', 'quality', 'sharply', 'Perhaps', 'been', 'hurt', 'fact', 'two', 'biggest', 'films', 'played', 'female', 'transsexual', 'trying', 'pass', 'male', 'boxer', 'Hopefully', 'girlie', 'role', 'one', 'will', 'expand', 'range', 'roles', 'made', 'available', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Gerry', 'career', 'interesting', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'been', 'surprising', 'variety', 'films', 'big', 'stardom', 'eluded', 'poised', 'make', 'leap', 'A', 'list', 'especially', 'success', '300', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Gerry', 'business', 'partner', 'was', 'interesting', 'later', 'when', 'Gerry', 'letter', 'was', 'telling', 'Holly', 'needed', 'job', 'could', 'love', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'was', 'one', 'Slayer', 'poster', 'were', 'BUFFY', 'references', 'still', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Marsters', 'non-SF', 'fantasy', 'role', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Dean', 'Winters', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan.So', 'conjunction', 'lot', 'nice', 'surface', 'elements', 'results', 'watchable', 'film', 'Mind', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'wo', ""n't"", 'object', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'cloying', 'sentimentality', 'film', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'did', 'object', 'so', 'result', 'had', 'very', 'minimal', 'appeal', 'did', 'have', 'little', 'yet', 'vampire', 'BUFFY', 'put', 'not', 'James', 'Marster', 'Spike', 'Master', 'Sometimes', 'little', 'enough']",P.S.

1116953,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000YAA68C,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","**1/2Before he dies, Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler) - the pluckiest victim of a brain tumor since the stiff-upper-lipped Bette Davis faced-down a similar fate in ""Dark Victory"" - comes up with an ingenious way to continue giving Holly (Hilary Swank), his soon-to-be widow, advice from beyond the grave.  He composes a series of upbeat letters to be delivered to her at regular intervals after he`s gone - missives that contain specific instructions on how to pick up the pieces of her shattered world and move on with her life.  You see, Holly was kind of an uptight stick-in-the-mud when they were married, and now the too-good-to-be-true, happy-go-lucky Irishman wants to loosen her up by getting her to perform karaoke, sending her on an all-expenses-paid trip to the place of his birth, and encouraging her to become a cobbler (I kid you not).  But will Gerry's continued presence in his widow's life actually retard her ability to let go of the past and start anew?  And does this ""Ghost"" knockoff stand a ghost of a chance of becoming as universally beloved as that earlier husband-hanging-around-after-death romantic classic?Beyond the cringe-inducing creepiness of its premise, ""P.S. I Love You,"" based on the novel by Cecilia Ahern, is one of those annoying romantic comedies in which the women get all goofy, frisky and/or tongue-tied the moment some good-looking guy so much as steps into their line of vision.  Moreover, Gerry is portrayed as such a saintly figure, both before his demise and most definitely thereafter, that we never get to know him as a real, flesh-and-blood person in his own right; instead, in order to make all the ladies in the audience swoon over his magnificent romantic spirit - one, I might add, that no man in the real world has the slightest hope of ever living up to - writer/director Richard LaGravenese has seen fit to deprive Gerry of all those flaws each of us is entitled to just for being a member of the human race - and which are truly the only things that make a character interesting in the end.  And with that crucial dimension missing from the couple's relationship, we soon lose interest in Holly as well.  And, of course, the movie cheats by having Gerry's illness take place entirely off-camera, so as not to disturb the light romantic tone of the piece, but it does little to make us care about the couple.  The movie finally hits on some honest sentiment round about the 115-minute mark, and the story does avoid going down one painfully obvious narrative pathway towards the end, but, by that time, it's much too late to undo the damage.A large cast of well-known and talented actors - Kathy Bates, Lisa Kudrow, Harry Connick Jr., among them - do yeomen work with poorly written parts, but it's an uphill slog against bathos, pratfalls and contrivance all the way.

1116964,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B000YAA68C,Spider Monkey,"[1, 1]","`P.S. I Love You' is a strange film in that it manages to be both funny and sad at the same time.When Holly loses her husband, Gerry, to a brain tumour she really struggles to come to terms with her loss.  Then on her 30th birthday she receives the first of many letters from Gerry that he wrote before he died.  These comfort and guide her through her grief and set her back on the path of her life again.This film has some genuinely funny moments, some of which come from Lisa Kudrow, and one minute you will be feeling choked up from a particular scene, only to be laughing in the next.  Swank is ok as Holly and Gerard Butler is good as Gerry, but I have to say one of the stronger performances comes from Kathy Bates, which is no surprise whatsoever as she always is a class actress.This has some wonderful flash backs of Holly and Gerry's early relationship and some of the surprise's he springs on her in the letters are poignant and heartfelt.  This is a bit of a `chick flick' (which is no criticism, more an observation), but it is done very well and despite being a little over-long, it is a touching enough film with an original storyline to keep you interested.  Some parts of this film are superfluous (like Harry Connick Jr's character who could easily be cut with no loss to the film), but I guess they add an extra dimension that would otherwise be lacking.All in all this is an engaging and reasonably emotional film and it's gentleness is offset by it's humour, which makes for an entertaining combination.  This is worth a viewing at some point and makes a nice way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",4,P.S.

(Well, that's one answer, there are others too, like the film Reign Over Me, with Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle doing a male perspective of similar themes.)P.S. I love you is a film about grief.  Grieving over the loss of a loved one, in this case Hilary Swank plays Holly who we'll see remembering her husband Gerry who has passed away from a brain tumor.  Gerry apparently had time to make plans before his death and those plans revolve around leaving behind letters to Holly providing her instructions on things she must do as she moves on from her loss.The film opens with a brief glimpse into Holly and Gerry's happy life, though at that point we're watching a lover's quarrel over discussion of their future together.  The little glimpse gives us a bit of insight into the fact that Gerry never seemed to have a plan while Holly was trying to be incredibly organized and work towards goals she had laid out for herself and them as a couple.  Seeing that initial glimpse of their relationship and that status makes Gerry's letters and the planning he has done all the more poignant.The movie flows fairly quickly over it's just over 2 hour running time and actually does a pretty good job of not dwelling on sadness.  Yes we know that Holly is unhappy about her loss, and yes she has issues adjusting to being alone and without the love of her life, but there isn't the depression and sadness that would drag a viewer down and leave you feeling like you just wanted the movie to end.Along the way Holly gets instructions to journey to Ireland.  We find out there, as if we didn't know from Gerry's accent in the scenes where he appears, that the couple had met in Ireland back when Holly was a student touring the world a bit as she was trying to determine what she wanted to be in life.  Apparently they fell in love at first sight, and were destined to be together always, or at least until death parted them.Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as Holly's mother, and other cast members perform well as Holly's sisters and friends.  The story is good, not great, but good, and the original writing shines through fairly well.  Adapted from a novel and somewhat Americanized (set in New York, rather than in Ireland), we do benefit from several beautiful scenes of the Irish countryside.Some sexual dialogue and sparing use of language that would cause the film to earn a more adult rating, but no nudity, and little objectionable content for those concerned about such things.Worth a rental at least.  Some may love the film and feel compelled to buy their own copy.  If you go with a disc-based copy, take a few minutes to check out the extras including a few deleted/extended scenes.  Unfortunately the deleted scenes are without introduction so viewers are left wondering where exactly they fit in the sequence of the film, but most are fairly obvious.  An introduction for each would have been nice, and one scene in particular (at the travel agency) really should have been included in some way.  Perhaps running next to the credits.  Most of the rest (outside of a reunion scene with Gina Gershon's character) are not really noticable, though that scene (with Gershon's character) probably should have made the final cut.",3,Where I have seen this all before?,1210550400,"05 12, 2008",2008,3255,"['Answer', 'Ghost', 'Well', 'one', 'answer', 'are', 'others', 'too', 'film', 'Reign', 'Me', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'doing', 'male', 'perspective', 'similar', 'themes.', 'P.S', 'love', 'film', 'grief', 'Grieving', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'case', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Holly', 'who', ""'ll"", 'see', 'remembering', 'husband', 'Gerry', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'brain', 'tumor', 'Gerry', 'apparently', 'had', 'time', 'make', 'plans', 'death', 'plans', 'revolve', 'leaving', 'letters', 'Holly', 'providing', 'instructions', 'things', 'must', 'do', 'loss.The', 'film', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'Holly', 'Gerry', 'happy', 'life', 'though', 'point', ""'re"", 'watching', 'lover', 'quarrel', 'discussion', 'future', 'together', 'little', 'glimpse', 'bit', 'insight', 'fact', 'Gerry', 'never', 'seemed', 'have', 'plan', 'Holly', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'incredibly', 'organized', 'work', 'towards', 'goals', 'had', 'laid', 'out', 'herself', 'couple', 'Seeing', 'initial', 'glimpse', 'relationship', 'status', 'Gerry', 'letters', 'planning', 'done', 'more', 'poignant.The', 'movie', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'just', '2', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'dwelling', 'sadness', 'Yes', 'know', 'Holly', 'unhappy', 'loss', 'yes', 'issues', 'adjusting', 'being', 'alone', 'love', 'life', ""n't"", 'depression', 'sadness', 'would', 'drag', 'viewer', 'down', 'leave', 'feeling', 'just', 'wanted', 'movie', 'end.Along', 'way', 'Holly', 'instructions', 'journey', 'Ireland', 'find', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Gerry', 'accent', 'scenes', 'where', 'couple', 'had', 'met', 'Ireland', 'back', 'when', 'Holly', 'was', 'student', 'touring', 'world', 'bit', 'was', 'trying', 'determine', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'life', 'Apparently', 'fell', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'were', 'destined', 'be', 'together', 'always', 'least', 'death', 'parted', 'them.Kathy', 'Bates', 'decent', 'performance', 'Holly', 'mother', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'perform', 'well', 'Holly', 'sisters', 'friends', 'story', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'original', 'writing', 'shines', 'fairly', 'well', 'Adapted', 'novel', 'somewhat', 'Americanized', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'rather', 'Ireland', 'do', 'benefit', 'several', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'Irish', 'countryside.Some', 'sexual', 'dialogue', 'sparing', 'use', 'language', 'would', 'cause', 'film', 'earn', 'more', 'adult', 'rating', 'nudity', 'little', 'objectionable', 'content', 'concerned', 'such', 'things.Worth', 'rental', 'least', 'may', 'love', 'film', 'feel', 'compelled', 'buy', 'own', 'copy', 'go', 'disc-based', 'copy', 'take', 'few', 'minutes', 'check', 'out', 'extras', 'including', 'few', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', 'Unfortunately', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'introduction', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'where', 'exactly', 'fit', 'sequence', 'film', 'most', 'are', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'introduction', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'travel', 'agency', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'way', 'Perhaps', 'running', 'next', 'credits', 'Most', 'rest', 'reunion', 'scene', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'character', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'noticable', 'scene', 'Gershon', 'character', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'final', 'cut']",P.S.

They urge her on to do stuff she normally wouldn't do - like attempt karaoke again after a disastrous past try; go on a trip with the girls; and he even encourages her to not close herself off, but to open herself up to the possiblility of falling in love again.Lacking a simple thing as chemistry between the two lead characters (or the potential new love interests for that matter), the movie version of ""PS I Love You"" falls flat and never really takes off. From the first ten minutes - one of their many arguments designed to show what a ""real"" couple they are - to the cheesy flashbacks to highlight their initial meeting. It just made me wonder how the heck they got together. And Swank's attempts at displaying her grief in a prolonged arc just didn't work - it was too contrived and unbelievable. She was channeling Diane Keaton in her annoyingly infamous crying scene in ""Something's Gotta Give."" I could not be more disappointed in the movie. I was expecting a romantic comedy-drama in the vein of ""Ghost,"" but instead it was just a mediocre story. The only time I shed a tear was when she kept calling his phone just to hear his voice - it seemed really natural, unlike the majority of her performance.

1116980,A1XOQOW2HJSOIV,B000YAA68C,"Trekkintheplains ""Take a sad song and make it...","[4, 5]","I simply ADORE this movie!  The fight that begins the film is what I label the perfect fight.  Holly is upset, Gerry doesn't know why, they get into an argument where both sides are coming from completely different directions with Gerry attempting to subvert Holly's anger with humor.  Which, of course as most women know, only makes her more upset.  They end up slamming doors then re-emerging to affirm how much they love each other and acknowledge the problems they have.  The most shocking part of the movie is in the next scene where Holly, her mother, sister, and friends are all at Gerry's wake.3 of my friends went with me to see this movie on New Year's Day and we all cried through the whole film.  When we walked out of the theatre, we had plans to immediately drive to the airport and book tickets for Ireland.First of all, being the red-blooded female that I am, Gerard Butler's character Gerry and his charming Irish accent and wonderful, sexy, sweet personality is enough to keep me interested for the 2 hours this film takes.  Second, being a fan of Grey's Anatomy, I couldn't help loving the naked rear view of Jeffrey Dean Morgan and his own charming Irish character.But mostly what is to be loved about this film is the love Gerry had for Holly, so strong and so pure that, knowing he would die, he crafted a plan to keep Holly's life going for a year until she was able to move on on her own.  Unselfish, everlasting love.  Every couple fights, and none of them are perfect, every relationship has stresses and issues.  But, as the movie reveals, they were in love from the moment they set eyes on each other.  A love that never ended after they found the kiss that would ""end the world as they knew it forever.""  A love that wanted her to find love again and tried to make her view herself through his eyes - not seeing her flaws but the reasons for his devotion and why he wanted her life to be full for as long as she continued to be alive.And, it's a comfort to know we don't lose Gerard Butler but continue to see clips of him throughout the film - Holly's memories played across the screen as she tries to move on with a life she felt hadn't started yet and now no longer includes the man she kept trying to start it with.I enjoyed the acting as well.  I think Hilary Swank was very believable and her supporting cast of characters were dynamic enough to give the film the impression of a real life and what happens as lives move on and tragedies happen.  The plot was engaging throughout - I found myself anticipating Gerry's letters just as much as Holly and grieving along with her just as though I had lost my perfect, caring, charismatic soulmate too.And I felt hope.  So many movies come along telling us stories of soulmates and second chances and following our hearts.  Some may call it clich&eacute;d and overdone to the point of exhaustion.  But I say there are real-life examples of these fairytale movies, and exemplary examples such as P.S. I Love You need to be made to remind us of the hopes and emotions we experience in our everyday lives - hopes that shouldn't be abandoned because we are told to be ""realistic"" and settle for something less than we deserve.  True happiness is to be achieved by continuing our dreams, there is a reason why different people are drawn to different things.  These types of movies - disgustingly called ""Chick flicks"" - don't bring false hope, they bring out what we already feel inside and keep us motivated for the time it takes for us to figure out and pursue what we need in our lives.This movie is sad, heartbreaking at points, but also humerous, engaging, sexy, romantic, hopeful, and realistic!  Holly can be stubborn, awkward, shy, dorky - and she's all the more human for the range of emotions and setbacks she goes through.  It's a movie of growth not just for Holly but for her family and friends as well.  People would do well to watch not for a gush of sentimentality and cathartic tears, but as a reminder of our flaws, our feelings and our dreams.Oh, and the music is GREAT!  I bought the soundtrack just for ""Love You Till the End"" by the Pogues and ended up loving several other songs.  The Irish ""If I Leave this World Alive"" and the first track ""Everything We Had"" AND the last track ""My Sweet Song"" are lovely!  I have some new favorite music to compliment my classic 60's and 70's songs, alternative, Indie, rock, selective pop, etc.",5,P.S. - Add this to my favorites list!,1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,4429,"['simply', 'ADORE', 'movie', 'fight', 'film', 'what', 'label', 'perfect', 'fight', 'Holly', 'upset', 'Gerry', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'get', 'argument', 'where', 'sides', 'are', 'coming', 'completely', 'different', 'directions', 'Gerry', 'attempting', 'subvert', 'Holly', 'anger', 'humor', 'Which', 'course', 'most', 'women', 'know', 'only', 'more', 'upset', 'end', 'up', 'slamming', 'doors', 'then', 're-emerging', 'affirm', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'other', 'problems', 'have', 'most', 'shocking', 'part', 'movie', 'next', 'scene', 'where', 'Holly', 'mother', 'sister', 'friends', 'are', 'Gerry', 'wake.3', 'friends', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'New', 'Year', 'Day', 'cried', 'whole', 'film', 'When', 'walked', 'theatre', 'had', 'plans', 'immediately', 'drive', 'airport', 'book', 'tickets', 'Ireland.First', 'being', 'red-blooded', 'female', 'am', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'character', 'Gerry', 'charming', 'Irish', 'accent', 'wonderful', 'sexy', 'sweet', 'personality', 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', '2', 'hours', 'film', 'Second', 'being', 'fan', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'loving', 'naked', 'rear', 'view', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'own', 'charming', 'Irish', 'character.But', 'mostly', 'what', 'be', 'loved', 'film', 'love', 'Gerry', 'had', 'Holly', 'so', 'strong', 'so', 'pure', 'knowing', 'would', 'die', 'crafted', 'plan', 'keep', 'Holly', 'life', 'going', 'year', 'was', 'able', 'move', 'own', 'Unselfish', 'everlasting', 'love', 'Every', 'couple', 'fights', 'none', 'are', 'perfect', 'relationship', 'stresses', 'issues', 'movie', 'reveals', 'were', 'love', 'moment', 'set', 'eyes', 'other', 'love', 'never', 'ended', 'found', 'kiss', 'would', 'end', 'world', 'knew', 'forever', 'love', 'wanted', 'find', 'love', 'again', 'tried', 'make', 'view', 'eyes', 'not', 'seeing', 'flaws', 'reasons', 'devotion', 'why', 'wanted', 'life', 'be', 'full', 'as', 'long', 'continued', 'be', 'alive.And', 'comfort', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'lose', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'continue', 'see', 'clips', 'film', 'Holly', 'memories', 'played', 'screen', 'move', 'life', 'felt', 'had', ""n't"", 'started', 'yet', 'now', 'no', 'longer', 'man', 'kept', 'trying', 'start', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'supporting', 'cast', 'characters', 'were', 'dynamic', 'enough', 'give', 'film', 'impression', 'real', 'life', 'what', 'lives', 'move', 'tragedies', 'happen', 'plot', 'was', 'engaging', 'found', 'anticipating', 'Gerry', 'letters', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Holly', 'grieving', 'along', 'just', 'had', 'lost', 'perfect', 'caring', 'charismatic', 'soulmate', 'too.And', 'felt', 'hope', 'So', 'many', 'movies', 'come', 'telling', 'stories', 'soulmates', 'second', 'chances', 'following', 'hearts', 'may', 'call', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'overdone', 'point', 'exhaustion', 'say', 'are', 'real-life', 'examples', 'fairytale', 'movies', 'exemplary', 'examples', 'such', 'P.S', 'Love', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'remind', 'hopes', 'emotions', 'experience', 'everyday', 'hopes', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'abandoned', 'are', 'told', 'be', 'realistic', 'settle', 'something', 'less', 'deserve', 'True', 'happiness', 'be', 'achieved', 'continuing', 'dreams', 'reason', 'why', 'different', 'people', 'are', 'drawn', 'different', 'things', 'types', 'movies', 'disgustingly', 'called', 'Chick', 'flicks', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'false', 'hope', 'bring', 'out', 'what', 'already', 'feel', 'inside', 'keep', 'motivated', 'time', 'figure', 'out', 'pursue', 'what', 'need', 'lives.This', 'movie', 'sad', 'heartbreaking', 'points', 'also', 'humerous', 'engaging', 'sexy', 'romantic', 'hopeful', 'realistic', 'Holly', 'can', 'be', 'stubborn', 'awkward', 'shy', 'dorky', 'more', 'human', 'range', 'emotions', 'setbacks', 'movie', 'growth', 'not', 'just', 'Holly', 'family', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'People', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'watch', 'not', 'gush', 'sentimentality', 'cathartic', 'tears', 'reminder', 'flaws', 'feelings', 'dreams.Oh', 'music', 'GREAT', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'just', 'Love', 'Till', 'End', 'Pogues', 'ended', 'up', 'loving', 'several', 'other', 'songs', 'Irish', 'Leave', 'World', 'Alive', 'first', 'track', 'Everything', 'Had', 'last', 'track', 'Sweet', 'Song', 'are', 'lovely', 'have', 'new', 'favorite', 'music', 'compliment', 'classic', '60', '70', 'songs', 'alternative', 'Indie', 'rock', 'selective', 'pop', 'etc']",P.S.

1116984,A1C80B497LCYKA,B000YAA68C,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[2, 2]","P.S.: I Love You is a good love story. I know, it's a chick flick. Well, it's a chick flick that has something to offer guys. Gerard Butler (300) is not exactly your soap-opera-idol type, nor is Hilary Swank (Million Dollar Baby). It's an interesting match, and makes for enjoyable interaction, both playful and feisty. Oh, did I mention that one of the couple dies in the first act?Hold on. I didn't just ruin the movie for you. That's the main point: Gerry (Gerard Butler) is dying, so he clandestinely writes a stack of letters to his wife, Holly, each ending with, ""P.S.: I love you."" Then he has someone send them to her one-at-a-time over the course of a year. The letters guide Holly into a new life. And they provide writer-director Richard LaGravenese (Freedom Writers, Horse Whisperer) with a vehicle for doing a ton of flashbacks between Gerry and Holly. It's quite effective.This is a comedy, and it is very funny. For the most part, Gerry's the funny man and Holly's the straight person. Gerry's a sly Irishman that knows how to wheedle; and Holly's a determined career woman that doesn't have a clue what she wants. As a matter of fact, Gerry asks her point-blank: ""What do you want?"" It is a poignant question that permeates the film. As Gerry holds his discontented wife in his arms, he says, "" I know what I want, 'cause I'm holding it in my hands. Do you?"" She doesn't. And it takes Gerry's death for her to figure that out.Using post mortem love letters to reveal Gerry and Holly's relationship is quite clever. It is fun getting to know this off-the-wall couple: Gerry, an Irish musician, who is the life of the party and brings humor even to his own death; and Holly, the cautious and pensive artist, questioning everything and offering pithy observations. We see that they love each other very much; but, like many of us, Holly doesn't appreciate what she has until he's gone. Fortunately, she gets a second chance with Gerry's letters; and, predictably, over the course of the film, Holly realizes what she is missing and what she now wants.The journey that Holly takes is painful for her, but fun for us. Most women will find it difficult to hold back the tears. But woven throughout are funny, even hilarious, moments, especially because of Holly's two wacky friends, played by Lisa Kudrow (Friends) and Gina Gershon (Rescue Me). Also, Harry Connick, Jr. plays an utter dork - but a philosophical one; Kathy Bates is Holly's practical mother - but a kind-hearted one; and Jeffrey Dean Morgan becomes Holly's new love interest - all entertaining performances.Obviously, this isn't the first time the subject of what women want has been breached. Back in 2000, a film by that title, starring Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt, made a half-hearted though entertaining effort at answering that question. Advertising creative Mel Gibson miraculously acquires the ability to read women's minds, which leads him to believe he now knows what they want, and can turn that knowledge to his advantage. However, he is mistaken because - as Holly points out to Harry Connick's character in P.S.: I Love You - even women themselves don't know what they want. So, even if men could read their minds - as many women seem to think we should - that still wouldn't help. No, like women's handbags of generations past, women's minds will always and forever remain mysteries, and rightly so; until God chooses to reveal them, which, I predict, will leave a lot of guys with perplexing looks on their faces and uttering, ""You've got to be kidding."" I'm sure I will be one of them.Gerard Butler and Hilary Swank are wonderful in P.S.: I Love You. Butler, who typically switches between action hero (300, Beowulf And Grendel, Tomb Raider: Cradle Of Life) and romantic lead (Phantom Of The Opera, Dear Frankie), has his best romantic role to date in this film. This is also the first time since Phantom that he has been able to show off his musical abilities. And, even though he's from Scotland, he is really Irish, so he has that going for him as well. But, don't expect him to have those abs from 300 - they are long gone.Swank is a two-time Academy Award-Winning Best Actress: Boys Don't Cry (1999) and Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby (2004). She loves the outdoors (sky diving, river rafting and skiing), which makes her perfect for the scenes in Ireland - a very outdoorsy country and my favorite part of the movie, especially her scenes with Gerry. Swank is honey and vinegar personified - exactly what the good-natured Gerry needs and, between the two of them, the right chemistry for this romantic comedy.If someone were to ask me, ""What do women want,"" I would say, ""I know what they need: a good pair of practical shoes. What they probably want is the most impractical, outrageous pair of designer shoes out there."" I would have said that before watching P.S.: I Love You. Now that I've seen it, it is extremely interesting to me that shoes do play an important role in this film, and in Holly's figuring out what she wants. If women ever did discover the joys and comforts of practical footwear, there would be a revolution. Suddenly, they would know exactly what they wanted, and there would no longer be a need for Hollywood, New York or Paris. I don't think that's going to happen in my lifetime.Waitsel Smith",4,DISCOVERING WHAT WOMEN WANT,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,5321,"['P.S', 'Love', 'good', 'love', 'story', 'know', 'chick', 'flick',

There were a few scenes that were hilarious, and the script was nicely written.  The 'funny stuff' flowed well into the more touching scenes, and none of the actors 'tried too hard.'  I am a fan of James Marsters, and it was great to see him in a more adult role.  Gina Gershon was toned down from her usual sex pot roles, and I loved her in this movie.  Lisa Kudrow was a hoot, and Kathy Bates had the right amount of concern for her hurting daughter.  I was pleasantly surprised that Swank carried off the comedy as well as she did, and her Karaoke scene was hilarious!  But I admit it, I watched for Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who was not in it as much as I would have liked.And let's not forget Harry Connick Jr.  He stole every scene he was in.Great movie.",4,Four and a Half stars if you want the truth (spoilers),1211500800,"05 23, 2008",2008,945,"['was', 'simple', 'love', 'story', 'nothing', 'necessarily', 'unique', 'here', 'loved', 'it.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'Butler', 'Swank', 'relationship', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'great', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'hilarious', 'script', 'was', 'nicely', 'written', ""'funny"", 'stuff', 'flowed', 'well', 'more', 'touching', 'scenes', 'none', 'actors', ""'tried"", 'too', 'hard', 'am', 'fan', 'James', 'Marsters', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'more', 'adult', 'role', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'was', 'toned', 'down', 'usual', 'sex', 'pot', 'roles', 'loved', 'movie', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'was', 'hoot', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'had', 'right', 'amount', 'concern', 'hurting', 'daughter', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Swank', 'carried', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'Karaoke', 'scene', 'was', 'hilarious', 'admit', 'watched', 'Butler', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'liked.And', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'in.Great', 'movie']",P.S.
