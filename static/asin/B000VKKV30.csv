1102201,A1Y09QLADQYQJG,B000VKKV30,&#34;T=H=E --- 'Older Than Dirt' --- Time Tra...,"[3, 3]","This 2006 theatrical moviehas an enjoyable*2.0 stereo soundtrack*Spanish subtitles*English Closed Captions*TrailersJenny McCarthy plays (800-year-old) Santa Claus's daughter that goes by the [abbreviated]name of Mary Cla's. There is no mention of HER age, but with parents' ages approaching onethousand, she's probably [what?] 400 herself.Well, anyway, THAT said, being IN a fantasy-mode, living on another continent, I foundthis movie to be a refreshing twist on a familiar plot: ""Great God! Santa is missing/sick/amnesiastic.""Where was I?Oh yeah, I'm an old guy living in Bavaria.I didn't recognize anyone's face but GEORGE ""Norm!"" WENDT from TV's CHEERS.A lot of money was spent on set design, location shots, and make up... and, it shows.George's Santa wig looks great. His beard looks real as well, maybe TOO real. Less than MY ideal, more like the ""real"" MIRACLE ON 34th STREET' one.There are PLENTY of reviews, on this site, for this movie.My review is probably repetative, but I'll echo the fact that this is a family movie without onesingle child on-screen, but DOES have plenty of child-like elves that even Scrooge would findentertaining for comic-relief.I bought this, and put it into a double disc box with the sequel (which has only Jenny McCarthyand three elves returning to repeat their roles). Different boyfriend, Santa, etc.Since I'm a rather ""tall and rotund"" fellow myself --- my wife is a foot shorter --- I found the most interesting, new, character in SANTA BABY TWO to be the female elf that is probably about 4'10""... and just TOO ""hot"" for The North Pole!Be a completist and buy BOTH, but the original is best!""
