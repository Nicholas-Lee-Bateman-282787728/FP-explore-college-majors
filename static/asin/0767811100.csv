Now I must tell you that I went in to see this movie with a poor attitude, because I don't like Jack Nicholson movies (except for &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; and &quot;Wolf&quot;). Ever  since I saw Jack in the &quot;Shining&quot;, I have thought the guy was  just too psycho. Well sure enough, I found that I now like a third Jack  Nicholson movie and yes...this should be known as a &quot;Jack  Nicholson&quot; movie. Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear were great in their  respective parts, but Jack carried the day. The movie was funny in a most  offensive way, serious in a very sad way, and bizarre in a Jack Nicholson  way. Jack plays a guy who is just rude and offensive to everyone he meets,  you feel sorry for him every so often, but those brief milliseconds pass  and you go back to thinking he is just a jerk....but then even jerks have  the potential for changing. Now any one of you who like to rip on others or  those of you who all know a person like that, then this film is for you,  but if any of you are on the receiving end of a person like this, then  you'll even appreciate this film, because guess what...he does begin to  change for the better...so maybe there is hope. It is not surprising that  Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Golden Globe awards for this film.  You will definitely be glad you saw it, even if you are sitting there right  now saying no way, well stop talking to yourself and go see it....you will  like it.

All of these characters have major issues, making the plot a bit too oppressive for much comic relief. Most of that was provided by Nicholson's character's expressions when confronted by the Helen Hunt character on a tear. She became more of a pitbull than he was; as his behavior improved, we were treated to more of her tempermental instability. I'm surprised that other viewers haven't much mentioned this.

Don't ask me why it interests me, but I definitely think everyone has a little obsessiveness in them somewhere - I know I certainly do.Instead, what did I get? A film that was stretched so thinly just over 2 hours, that I was getting bored, and lower in my seat as time ticked slowly by. It could have easily been cut down to 2 hours, if not less, and still told the same story. It's really badly edited, there's entire scenes in which nothing happens. And there's not many references to Jack Nicholson's obsessive compulsiveness in this. Instead, we get the odd wee bit, and that's it. Washing his hands with a new soap under very hot water and then throwing it in the bin; covering his food in clingfilm; eating with plastic cutlery; sitting at the same table in a restaurant; walking sideways and over the cracks in the pavement; not letting people touch him; being OTT organised ... But all the obsessive compulsiveness is only given brief screen time, and the film lacks because of it.Also along came a film a few years later, called Something's Gotta Give, which was a much better, and much more thrilling movie. It also funnily enough starred Jack Nicholson, and was basically the same plot & same characters - just better. Simon the gay guy was remade into a doctor played by Keanu Reeves; Helen Hunt became Diane Keaton. HELLO?! Am I the only one who sees this? Or just the only one who's seen Something's Gotta Give? :)However, apart from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest & Something's Gotta Give, this is one of the best performances I've seen from Jack Nicholson.

10683,A2NBHXFEDLV1W2,0767811100,,"[2, 7]","I feel two ways about this film... I rather liked all of the actors, especially Nicholson.  I thought, however, that some of the writing was inconsistent, especially in the case of Kinnear's character, meaning I think some of his actions weren't consistent with his overall behaviour... I'd have to watch it again to tell you exactly what.  Their portrayal of OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder), as well, wasn't terribly convincing.  Again, the consistency... he recovered too easily from his phobias; the washing of the hands multiple times was ignored after the first time... later, his degree of fear of being dirty was downplayed.  My nitpicking is probably due to being the son of a psychology major.One other thing struck me about it: the theme becomes &quot;OCs can change themselves through force of will, through having to conform to other people's expectations... all they need is the right motivation,&quot; which I disagree with.  Nicholson overcomes his fear because he's in love... it's a nice idea, but it oversimplifies OCD.  Hunt's character never acknowledges that she might have to account, somwhat, for Melvin's disorder.

10684,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,0767811100,,"[3, 3]","Nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, As Good As It Gets became one of the surprise blockbusters of 1997. Jack Nicholson dispenses insults with his one-in-a-billion sense of delivery, and if you like serious comedies, this is the film for you. Helen Hunt is masterful in her portrayal of a hard-luck single mother who befriends Nicholson's oddball character, and Greg Kinnear does well as the neighbor who faces hard times himself. Home to a well-written screenplay exhibiting superb direction from James L. Brooks, As Good As It Gets makes a place for itself in the annals of movie history...Jack Nicholson stars as cranky, bitter, semi-shut-in novelist Melvin Udall who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder. Everyday, like clockwork, Melvin eats breakfast at the same diner where he brings his own utensils and is waited on by the same waitress (the only one who will agree to serve him), Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt). Despite his eccentricities, the two form a sort of unspoken understanding of each other. Meanwhile, Melvin's neighbor, Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), a homosexual artist who is often the object of Melvin's bigoted comments, entertains the elite art circles of New York. Simon's dog forms a further divide between the two when Simon drops him down the trash chute to stop his barking.When Simon is attacked in his home and left beaten and unable to create his art, all of his friends abandon him and the bills are left unpaid. Melvin, having reluctantly agreed to take care of the dog in Simon's absence, develops an attachment for the dog. Meanwhile, Carol Connelly leaves the diner in order to better take care of her sick son. Distraught, Melvin offers to pay for treatments in order to have Carol back as his waitress once again. With each character struggling with personal tragedies, the three slowly develop a respect for each other and a friendship which only grows...Co-stars Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt swept the leading role Oscars for the male and female categories, and their onscreen relationship is one of the more memorable in cinema history. Forming a love/hate relationship and bonding through their various travails, Melvin Udall and Carol Connelly are one of the true odd couples of tinsel town. In fact, if a cast of lesser abilities had played the roles, the film would have been a drastic failure because such relationships would simply be unbelievable. Playing the role of Melvin's gay neighbor Simon, Greg Kinnear made a name for himself and entered into the hallowed halls of the who's who of Hollywood.With an all-star cast that includes several Academy Award winners (Cuba Gooding, Jr. won for Jerry Maguire), As Good As It Gets rests its fortunes on the backs of its quirky and sometimes neurotic band of characters. More than able to meet the task, Nicholson, Hunt, and Kinnear strike gold with this Best Picture candidate which combines drama and comedy into a unique, one-of-a-kind experience. With one-liners zinging from Nicholson in almost every scene, you'll be hard pressed not to laugh out loud. And with Kinnear and Hunt to bring a serious note to Nicholson's strange character, As Good As It Gets breaks into the ranks of a short list of all-time great films. It's one you definitely won't want to miss...The DVD Report",5,Critically acclaimed and outright hilarious!,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,3305,"['Nominated', 'seven', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'As', 'Good', 'became', 'one', 'surprise', 'blockbusters', '1997', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'insults', 'one-in-a-billion', 'sense', 'delivery', 'like', 'serious', 'comedies', 'film', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'masterful', 'portrayal', 'hard-luck', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'Nicholson', 'oddball', 'character', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'well', 'neighbor', 'who', 'hard', 'times', 'Home', 'well-written', 'screenplay', 'exhibiting', 'superb', 'direction', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'As', 'Good', 'place', 'annals', 'movie', 'history', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'cranky', 'bitter', 'semi-shut-in', 'novelist', 'Melvin', 'Udall', 'who', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'Everyday', 'clockwork', 'Melvin', 'breakfast', 'same', 'diner', 'where', 'own', 'utensils', 'waited', 'same', 'waitress', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'agree', 'serve', 'Carol', 'Connelly', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'eccentricities', 'two', 'form', 'sort', 'unspoken', 'understanding', 'other', 'Meanwhile', 'Melvin', 'neighbor', 'Simon', 'Bishop', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'homosexual', 'artist', 'who', 'often', 'object', 'Melvin', 'bigoted', 'comments', 'elite', 'art', 'circles', 'New', 'York', 'Simon', 'dog', 'further', 'divide', 'two', 'when', 'Simon', 'down', 'trash', 'chute', 'stop', 'barking.When', 'Simon', 'attacked', 'home', 'left', 'beaten', 'unable', 'create', 'art', 'friends', 'abandon', 'bills', 'are', 'left', 'unpaid', 'Melvin', 'having', 'reluctantly', 'agreed', 'take', 'care', 'dog', 'Simon', 'absence', 'attachment', 'dog', 'Meanwhile', 'Carol', 'Connelly', 'diner', 'order', 'better', 'take', 'care', 'sick', 'son', 'Distraught', 'Melvin', 'pay', 'treatments', 'order', 'have', 'Carol', 'back', 'waitress', 'once', 'again', 'character', 'struggling', 'personal', 'tragedies', 'three', 'slowly', 'develop', 'respect', 'other', 'friendship', 'only', 'Co-stars', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'swept', 'leading', 'role', 'Oscars', 'male', 'female', 'categories', 'onscreen', 'relationship', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'cinema', 'history', 'Forming', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'bonding', 'various', 'travails', 'Melvin', 'Udall', 'Carol', 'Connelly', 'are', 'one', 'true', 'odd', 'couples', 'tinsel', 'town', 'fact', 'cast', 'lesser', 'abilities', 'had', 'played', 'roles', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'drastic', 'failure', 'such', 'relationships', 'would', 'simply', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'Playing', 'role', 'Melvin', 'gay', 'neighbor', 'Simon', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'made', 'name', 'entered', 'hallowed', 'halls', 'who', 'who', 'Hollywood.With', 'all-star', 'cast', 'several', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winners', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'won', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'As', 'Good', 'fortunes', 'backs', 'quirky', 'sometimes', 'neurotic', 'band', 'characters', 'More', 'able', 'meet', 'task', 'Nicholson', 'Hunt', 'Kinnear', 'strike', 'gold', 'Best', 'Picture', 'candidate', 'drama', 'comedy', 'unique', 'one-of-a-kind', 'experience', 'one-liners', 'zinging', 'Nicholson', 'almost', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'not', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'Kinnear', 'Hunt', 'bring', 'serious', 'note', 'Nicholson', 'strange', 'character', 'As', 'Good', 'breaks', 'ranks', 'short', 'list', 'all-time', 'great', 'films', 'one', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

Maybe it was the fact that I had a lot on my mind, or that my homophobic parents were in the living  room, but I definitely expected more from it. Don't get me wrong; I thought  that it was a really great film, with a lot of witty dialogue, superbly  talented actors, and a touching storyline. I can't exactly pinpoint what  was missing for me, though. But with a movie like this, who cares? Greg  Kinnear's performance of Simon, the gay man whose assault throws Melvin's  life into a frenzy, will definitely strike a chord with many gay adults as  well as children who have experienced similar experiences with homophobic  parents. I think that the director, James Brooks, did a wonderful job of  casting Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson as the two love leads. The love  relationship in this movie was not about chemistry between the actors; it  is about the human heart and its ability to love any and all.

Because I like it so much, I would like the reader to know what a fun ride to expect.Jack Nicholson is an aging, obsessive-compulsive man who is basically content to tolerate the world around him long enough so that he can write his romance novels and die.  He hopes the rest of the world will lead the way, though.  One thoughtless comment to a woman whom is the closest thing he has to a friend causes him to make a few subtle changes in his life that lead to bigger changes.As his character slowly grows up, the audience gets to enjoy his interactions with all the people you would think a man like this would spend his entire life running from as they slowly become his family.It's possibly a fair statement to say that the theme of this movie is that wounded people can help to heal each other in ways no healthy person ever could but the point of the movie is simply to follow the main character as he learns how to love, something he constantly writes about but knows nothing of.The script is filled with emotion and will take you from lauging out loud to crying in whimpers (hopefully not REALLY crying, but the point is made).The comedy in this film is hilarious.  There is pretty much every type of comedy represented, but a great deal of it stems from sarcasm.Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance is my favorite here because he's just so hard to figure out.  His motivations are obvious, but his character's attitudes change frequently, which I imagine is likely for a dealer who has to deal with multiple artists and a crazy man such as Mr. Nicholson.DVD extras are skimpy but do include a commentary with Jack and Helen among others.

10701,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767811100,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I'm thinking about making today `Jack Nicholson Friday', but now that I say that, watch this be the only review of a Nicholson film I write today.I've been thinking a lot about this film this past week.  My friends and I were discussing the 97 Oscar race, especially the Best Actress race (which always brings heated debate).  This year holds one of those lineups that many people look back on with either love or hate.  You had Bonham-Carter, Christie, Dench, Hunt and Winslet.  Most of my friends firmly believe that Hunt stole Dench's Oscar.  A few consider Winslet's turn to be the rightful winner, while the majority find her nomination horrendous.  Christie remains mostly an afterthought in our group (not her finest moment), and Bonham-Carter is consistently considered great but not the best.  One thing is for certain though, the majority of my cinephile friends consider Helen Hunts win to be one of the worst in the History of Oscar.  Personally I find Dench to be overrated, Christie to be an afterthought (I often forget she was a contender), Winslet to be beautifully effective, Bonham-Carter to be utterly entrancing and Helen Hunt to be, quite simply, PERFECTION.Yes, to much of my friend's dismay (aside from a few smart people), I am a Hunt Fan, and proud of it.For me, this film works because of her delicate yet earnest performance.  She really captures everything that her character is experiencing, as a mother, as a woman.  She exposes her character's brittle emotional composure without losing the strength that she has to maintain.  She only allows her character to fold, to break, in small increments (that scene with her mother is just utterly magnificent) before drawing her back out of her fragile state and placing the mask of stability back over her face.  Her character's yearning to find peace, pleasure and companionship is so believable, and so sincere; to the point where a relationship with the vile Melvin Udall seems almost realistic.  Sure, she has her moments where you can tell she is `trying', but it is saved by her genuine approach to the character's entire persona.  She embraces the flaws, for it is those flaws that make Carol Connelly a real person.Enough about Hunt though.The film, for me, is great, but much like `Good Will Hunting' (which was released the same year), this film is not complete.  The script is generic at best (it is better than `Good Will Hunting's script, but that isn't saying much), but it is the earnest performances that really carry the film.  Hunt and Kinnear (such a layered and heartfelt performance) are fantastic, and while Nicholson is undoubtedly phoning this in (as many have mentioned, he could do this in his sleep), his chemistry with Hunt is sensational.  This `relationship' really shouldn't make sense, and yet the sell if flawlessly.Ha, so since this is `Jack Nicholson Friday', maybe I should talk about him.  I love Nicholson.  I consider him one of the finest actors to ever grace the screen, and I devour almost every film he's in.  For me, he is the weakest link here, but that isn't because he doesn't give a good performance.  This is too easy for Nicholson.  He has given this performance in a slew of films.  He's `comfortable'.  I prefer him when he's broken out of his mold (watch him in the stellar `About Schmidt'!) and so, while he is effective, his performance is far from noteworthy.  His Oscar win was a bit too much, especially since Duvall, Damon and Hoffman were all better in their respective roles.Alas, I still heart him.So, I really like this film.  Sure, it could have used a better script, one with more layers and more depth, but Hunt is too good to ignore here (I really abhor the hate she receives from so-called cinephiles).  This may not be as good as it gets, but it's still very good.",4,Thank god for Helen Hunt!,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,3809,"[""'m"", 'thinking', 'making', 'today', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Friday', 'now', 'say', 'watch', 'be', 'only', 'review', 'Nicholson', 'film', 'write', 'today.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'thinking', 'lot', 'film', 'past', 'week', 'friends', 'were', 'discussing', '97', 'Oscar', 'race', 'especially', 'Best', 'Actress', 'race', 'always', 'heated', 'debate', 'year', 'one', 'lineups', 'many', 'people', 'look', 'back', 'love', 'hate', 'had', 'Bonham-Carter', 'Christie', 'Dench', 'Hunt', 'Winslet', 'Most', 'friends', 'firmly', 'believe', 'Hunt', 'stole', 'Dench', 'Oscar', 'A', 'few', 'consider', 'Winslet', 'turn', 'be', 'rightful', 'winner', 'majority', 'find', 'nomination', 'horrendous', 'Christie', 'mostly', 'afterthought', 'group', 'not', 'finest', 'moment', 'Bonham-Carter', 'consistently', 'considered', 'great', 'not', 'best', 'One', 'thing', 'certain', 'majority', 'cinephile', 'friends', 'consider', 'Helen', 'Hunts', 'win', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'History', 'Oscar', 'Personally', 'find', 'Dench', 'be', 'overrated', 'Christie', 'be', 'afterthought', 'often', 'forget', 'was', 'contender', 'Winslet', 'be', 'beautifully', 'effective', 'Bonham-Carter', 'be', 'utterly', 'entrancing', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'be', 'quite', 'simply', 'PERFECTION.Yes', 'much', 'friend', 'dismay', 'aside', 'few', 'smart', 'people', 'am', 'Hunt', 'Fan', 'proud', 'it.For', 'film', 'delicate', 'yet', 'earnest', 'performance', 'really', 'everything', 'character', 'experiencing', 'mother', 'woman', 'character', 'brittle', 'emotional', 'composure', 'losing', 'strength', 'maintain', 'only', 'character', 'fold', 'break', 'small', 'increments', 'scene', 'mother', 'just', 'utterly', 'magnificent', 'drawing', 'back', 'fragile', 'state', 'placing', 'mask', 'stability', 'back', 'face', 'character', 'yearning', 'find', 'peace', 'pleasure', 'companionship', 'so', 'believable', 'so', 'sincere', 'point', 'where', 'relationship', 'vile', 'Melvin', 'Udall', 'almost', 'realistic', 'Sure', 'moments', 'where', 'can', 'tell', 'trying', 'saved', 'genuine', 'approach', 'character', 'entire', 'persona', 'flaws', 'flaws', 'make', 'Carol', 'Connelly', 'real', 'person.Enough', 'Hunt', 'though.The', 'film', 'great', 'much', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'film', 'not', 'complete', 'script', 'generic', 'best', 'better', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'script', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'earnest', 'performances', 'really', 'carry', 'film', 'Hunt', 'Kinnear', 'such', 'layered', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Nicholson', 'undoubtedly', 'phoning', 'many', 'have', 'mentioned', 'could', 'do', 'sleep', 'chemistry', 'Hunt', 'sensational', 'relationship', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'yet', 'sell', 'flawlessly.Ha', 'so', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Friday', 'maybe', 'should', 'talk', 'love', 'Nicholson', 'consider', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'devour', 'almost', 'film', 'weakest', 'link', 'here', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'give', 'good', 'performance', 'too', 'easy', 'Nicholson', 'given', 'performance', 'slew', 'films', 'comfortable', 'prefer', 'when', 'broken', 'mold', 'watch', 'stellar', 'Schmidt', 'so', 'effective', 'performance', 'far', 'noteworthy', 'Oscar', 'win', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'especially', 'Duvall', 'Damon', 'Hoffman', 'were', 'better', 'respective', 'roles.Alas', 'still', 'heart', 'him.So', 'really', 'film', 'Sure', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'better', 'script', 'one', 'more', 'layers', 'more', 'depth', 'Hunt', 'too', 'good', 'ignore', 'here', 'really', 'abhor', 'hate', 'so-called', 'cinephiles', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'still', 'very', 'good']",N/A

10703,AK6UVFSU07NXH,0767811100,Anthony Hinde,"[2, 2]","The first time I saw &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot; an unusual thing happened. I was sitting in the cinema and the film was a little over half  way through. The thought was running through my head, &quot;I have to see  this film again&quot;. Even at that point I had laughed more and cried more  than I do in the bulk of films and besides which, I was having a brilliant  time.The dialogue is so witty that you want to hear most of it  again immediately. The characters are all so real that it felt like I was  living in their neighborhood. Of course the story was also a good one but  to my mind it wasn't the driving force behind the film. It must also be  said that the casting was inspired.Jack Nicholson is not always  my first choice for roles since he can't seem to play  quiet characters. In  this case however, quiet is the last thing that is needed for the character  of Melvin Udall. He is an obsessive compulsive writer of romance novels  whose command of language is only exceeded by his willingness to hurt  anyone who comes too close. His journey through the film shows us the inner  man who really wants to love and be loved but is crippled by overwhelming  fears. It is only fate and the love of a woman that enables him to start  lowering his shield of obnoxiousness.His love is a not so young  waitress at Melvin's breakfast restaurant of choice. Carol Connerly, played  skillfully by Helen Hunt, is a martyr to her son's asthma. She lives with  her mother, Beverly, and only child, Spencer, in a very small apartment in,  what I suppose is, New Jersey. Living with regular trips to the hospital,  along with endemic malpractice by underage interns, seems to have prepared  her sufficiently to deal with Melvin's perverse behaviour at the  restaurant. In fact she is the only waitress who is prepared to serve him.But this morning relationship(?) has been going on for a long time  and we can see it  has reached a plateau. So a catalyst is introduced in  the form of Melvin's gay neighbor, Simon Bishop, his art agent, Frank  Sachs, and his impossibly sensitive dog Verdell. It is clear from the start  that Melvin wants to have as little as possible to do with all three of  them. But a sex worker turned model and his two associates have different  ideas when they rob Simon and brutally beat him senseless.Luckily  Melvin is able to be intimidated by Frank, (which is fun for the audience),  into taking care of Verdell while Simon is in the hospital. We are then  treated to a wonderful time watching Verdell seduce Melvin. He is the  perfect pet for a meticulous, antisocial writer like Melvin. This small dog  is quiet, polite, sensitive and cute. And he slowly builds a small bridge  between Melvin and Simon which in turn leads to a road trip in search of  parental funding.Melvin is asked to drive Simon to his parents  town and is further encouraged by Carol. What better excuse to get to know  her than to drag Carol along. I loved his reasoning. &quot;I need you as  chaperone in case he pulls out the stiff one eye on me&quot;. None of us  believe him, not even Carol.So without giving away the whole  story I will sum up by saying &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot; is a very  special film. It will touch you and make your life better, if only for a  couple of hours. Don't miss your chance to see it.",5,Madly in love,957398400,"05 4, 2000",2000,3331,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'quot', 'As', 'Good', 'Gets', 'quot', 'unusual', 'thing', 'happened', 'was', 'sitting', 'cinema', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'way', 'thought', 'was', 'running', 'head', 'quot', 'have', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'quot', 'Even', 'point', 'had', 'laughed', 'more', 'cried', 'more', 'do', 'bulk', 'films', 'besides', 'was', 'having', 'brilliant', 'time.The', 'dialogue', 'so', 'witty', 'want', 'hear', 'most', 'again', 'immediately', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'real', 'felt', 'was', 'living', 'neighborhood', 'course', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'one', 'mind', 'was', ""n't"", 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'casting', 'was', 'inspired.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'not', 'always', 'first', 'choice', 'roles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'play', 'quiet', 'characters', 'case', 'however', 'quiet', 'last', 'thing', 'needed', 'character', 'Melvin', 'Udall', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'writer', 'romance', 'novels', 'command', 'language', 'only', 'exceeded', 'willingness', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'who', 'too', 'close', 'journey', 'film', 'inner', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'love', 'be', 'loved', 'crippled', 'overwhelming', 'fears', 'only', 'fate', 'love', 'woman', 'start', 'lowering', 'shield', 'obnoxiousness.His', 'love', 'not', 'so', 'young', 'waitress', 'Melvin', 'breakfast', 'restaurant', 'choice', 'Carol', 'Connerly', 'played', 'skillfully', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'martyr', 'son', 'asthma', 'mother', 'Beverly', 'only', 'child', 'Spencer', 'very', 'small', 'apartment', 'what', 'suppose', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Living', 'regular', 'trips', 'hospital', 'endemic', 'malpractice', 'underage', 'interns', 'have', 'prepared', 'sufficiently', 'deal', 'Melvin', 'perverse', 'behaviour', 'restaurant', 'fact', 'only', 'waitress', 'who', 'prepared', 'serve', 'him.But', 'morning', 'relationship', 'been', 'going', 'long', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'reached', 'plateau', 'catalyst', 'introduced', 'form', 'Melvin', 'gay', 'neighbor', 'Simon', 'Bishop', 'art', 'agent', 'Frank', 'Sachs', 'impossibly', 'sensitive', 'dog', 'Verdell', 'clear', 'start', 'Melvin', 'have', 'as', 'little', 'possible', 'do', 'three', 'sex', 'worker', 'turned', 'model', 'two', 'associates', 'have', 'different', 'ideas', 'when', 'rob', 'Simon', 'brutally', 'beat', 'senseless.Luckily', 'Melvin', 'able', 'be', 'intimidated', 'Frank', 'fun', 'audience', 'taking', 'care', 'Verdell', 'Simon', 'hospital', 'are', 'then', 'treated', 'wonderful', 'time', 'watching', 'Verdell', 'seduce', 'Melvin', 'perfect', 'pet', 'meticulous', 'antisocial', 'writer', 'Melvin', 'small', 'dog', 'quiet', 'polite', 'sensitive', 'cute', 'slowly', 'small', 'bridge', 'Melvin', 'Simon', 'turn', 'road', 'trip', 'search', 'parental', 'funding.Melvin', 'asked', 'drive', 'Simon', 'parents', 'town', 'further', 'encouraged', 'Carol', 'What', 'better', 'excuse', 'get', 'know', 'drag', 'Carol', 'loved', 'reasoning', 'quot', 'need', 'chaperone', 'case', 'out', 'stiff', 'one', 'eye', 'quot', 'None', 'believe', 'not', 'even', 'Carol.So', 'giving', 'away', 'whole', 'story', 'will', 'sum', 'up', 'saying', 'quot', 'As', 'Good', 'Gets', 'quot', 'very', 'special', 'film', 'will', 'touch', 'make', 'life', 'better', 'only', 'couple', 'hours', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'chance', 'see']",N/A
10704,A1534MBU6VJXYN,0767811100,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[2, 2]","Looking back on the 1997 Academy Awards, it still makes me sick that ""Titanic"" won best picture. That was box office hype at its worst, as the film only won because it was this gargantuan box office hit. Had this film flopped, then there's no doubt in my mind that either ""Good Will Hunting"" or this brilliant comedy would have won Best Picture. Far better than that film that should have sank like the ship it was named for, ""As Good As It Gets"" is wihtout a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Of course, since it was written by comedy mastermind James L. Brooks (""Terms Of Endearment"", ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", ""The Simpsons""), you can't expect anything less than a comedic work of art (though ""Spanglish"" was little underwhelming).Jack Nicholson quite possibly the finest performance of his career as novelist Melvin Udall, a rude (to put it mildly), middle aged man with an extreme case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder who's going through a serious writer's block/mid-life crisis. He is the most unlikable man in New York City, with no compssion for animals, women or his homosexual neighbor (a perfectly cast Greg Kinear) and his art dealer friend Frank (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). He bring hiw own silverwear to his favorite restaurant in town, where he must be served by his favorite waitress, Carol (Helen Hunt), who even he treats rudely. However, something changes. When his neighbor is beaten up by vicious thugs, Melvin is forced to watch his beloved dog. Though uneasy at first, Melvin and the dog become great friends. In fact, when his real owner comes home, the dog prefers to stay with Melvin (the scene where Kinear impersonates Nicholson is priceless). Melvin is starting to develope feelings for Carol as well. The problem is, she's too busy caring for her son to take notice - plus she doesn't like him anyway.

The writing is on the money, the directing is excellent and all the performances were top notch (Nicholson and Hunt deserved their Oscars, and Kinear and Gooding were great as well).

That's more reason to treasure a movie gem like this one. Jack Nicholson stars as a grumpy romance book author with obsessive compulsive disorder. He has taken a liking to a single waitress who is the mother of an asthmatic boy. He also starts a friendship(at first unwillingly)with his gay artist neighbor and the man's little dog. Jack begins to try to change his ways to impress the lovely waitress(Helen Hunt). The film goes through different stages of their love/hate relationship. His artist neighbor is horribly beaten up and Jack sort of takes to him, creating an odd friendship. The romance that eventually blossoms between Jack and Helen is a little questionable. Could this really happen?. The two performers are so perfect and believeable in these performances that they make you think that it is possible. Greg Kinnear as the neighbor is fantastic. He is not just the former host of ""Talk Soup"". What can you say about Jack?. He's the best. He deserved the Oscar he won for this. So did Helen Hunt. Her scenes crying to her mother were classic.

I usually don't even bother to watch the awards show because it's very rare that there is anyone I really want to win.  1998 was one of those rare exceptions...and it was because of this movie.There is something about Helen Hunt that fascinates me.  Not only is she able to display believable emotions but more importantly she always comes across as someone whom the viewer truly, deeply cares about.  I am not embarrassed to admit that I cried on more than one occasion during this film.  It was at times heartbreaking to watch her character suffer through so many difficult situations.""As Good As It Gets"" features the talents of Helen Hunt, Jack Nicholson, Cuba Gooding Jr., Greg Kinnear and the underrated Shirley Knight.  There is, of course, a plot to the film but it seems secondary to what this movie really is about...human interaction.  Jack Nicholson plays Melvin, a completely neurotic person who won't step on cracks in the sidewalk and actually brings his own silverware to the only restaurant he'll eat at.  Helen Hunt plays Carol, a waitress with whom Melvin becomes quite smitten with.  Simon (Greg Kinnear) is a gay tenant in Melvin's building and Kevin (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is his lover.Circumstances come about which send Melvin, Carol and Simon on a road trip to remember.  I would usually go more into detail about the plot mechanics but they seem almost trivial in a movie of this caliber.  The true enjoyment is watching some of the finest actors of our time doing what they do best.  You really want to see these characters find true happiness.  If you are one of the few people who have yet to see this film then please, please go out and rent it...or better yet, buy a copy.

I'm new to the 'As Good as it Gets' fanclub sort-a-speak since I, for the first time, saw it last night despite the fact that my wife HATES the movie and was pissed I rented it.  I have always been a fan of Jack Nicholson for he has been on top of his game for YEARS and doesn't show any sign of letting up anytime soon (I mean, he's won 3 oscars and has been nominated 12 times).  I've also always enjoyed Hunt and Kinnear so it's a shoe-in for me to enjoy this film right?  I just for some reason have never had the desire to see it, and then there I was walking through the local blockbuster thinking, you know what, I'll just go for it, and I'm so glad I did.  Right off the bat Nicholson is at his best playing the grumpy old man, but he always adds just the right amount of class and confidence to lift him from Walter Matthau status and place him in the Michael Caine league.  Nicholson plays Melvin, an obsesive compulsive racist bigot sexist grump of a man who is hated by everyone and very well may like it that way.  He lives in the same apartment complex as Simon (Kinnear) a gay painter who is the subject of Melvin's vented anger (which is displayed by his constant verbal battery of poor Simon and the abuse he inflicts of Simon's dog) but after Simon is beaten and injured Melvin is pusuaded (a bit forcfully) to take care of Simon's dog.  Unexpectedly Melvin forms an attachment to the dog and is somehow changed by his experience and moved to be a nicer, better person.  He starts by helping a local waitress Carol (Hunt) who may just be the only person who tolerates him.  Carol & Melvin & Simon throughout the remander of the film form a bond that is both unexpected and remarkably beautiful.  Helen Hunt is wonderful in this film, as is Kinnear, but it's Nicholson's show and there isn't a better man for the show.  I have never watched a performance that made me more anxious then watching Nicholson say the WRONG thing everytime, but as Carol realizes, he has his moments, and those moments are about as good as it gets.",5,I'm speachless,1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,2077,"['friends', 'rarity', ""'m"", 'new', ""'As"", 'Good', 'fanclub', 'sort-a-speak', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'last', 'night', 'fact', 'wife', 'movie', 'was', 'pissed', 'rented', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'been', 'top', 'game', 'YEARS', ""n't"", 'show', 'sign', 'letting', 'up', 'anytime', 'soon', 'mean', 'won', '3', 'oscars', 'been', 'nominated', '12', 'times', ""'ve"", 'also', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Hunt', 'Kinnear', 'shoe-in', 'enjoy', 'film', 'right', 'just', 'reason', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'desire', 'see', 'then', 'was', 'walking', 'local', 'blockbuster', 'thinking', 'know', 'what', ""'ll"", 'just', 'go', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'Right', 'bat', 'Nicholson', 'best', 'playing', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'always', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'class', 'confidence', 'lift', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'status', 'place', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'league', 'Nicholson', 'Melvin', 'obsesive', 'compulsive', 'racist', 'bigot', 'sexist', 'grump', 'man', 'who', 'hated', 'everyone', 'very', 'well', 'may', 'like', 'way', 'same', 'apartment', 'complex', 'Simon', 'Kinnear', 'gay', 'painter', 'who', 'subject', 'Melvin', 'vented', 'anger', 'displayed', 'constant', 'verbal', 'battery', 'poor', 'Simon', 'abuse', 'Simon', 'dog', 'Simon', 'beaten', 'injured', 'Melvin', 'pusuaded', 'bit', 'forcfully', 'take', 'care', 'Simon', 'dog', 'Unexpectedly', 'Melvin', 'attachment', 'dog', 'somehow', 'changed', 'experience', 'moved', 'be', 'nicer', 'better', 'person', 'helping', 'local', 'waitress', 'Carol', 'Hunt', 'who', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'Carol', 'Melvin', 'Simon', 'remander', 'film', 'form', 'bond', 'unexpected', 'remarkably', 'beautiful', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Kinnear', 'Nicholson', 'show', ""n't"", 'better', 'man', 'show', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'performance', 'made', 'more', 'anxious', 'then', 'watching', 'Nicholson', 'say', 'WRONG', 'thing', 'everytime', 'Carol', 'moments', 'moments', 'are', 'as', 'good']",N/A

You feel that saddness because you know you will no longer be able to enjoy any more of their work.  Luckily when that person has made some films you can look back at them at the prime of their careers.  Harold Ramis first came into my life on the SCTV TV series out of Canada.  The show was much like Saturday Night Live but because it was only a half hour long it moved from sketch to sketch quilkly and didn't need to be dragged out like a live show requires.  It was our favorite half hour of the week for years. But Ramis was not merely a performer he was a great writer and director.  Films like Animal House, Caddy Shack, Stripes, Ghost Busters, and Groundhog's Day were among the biggest hits of their time.  Films like the National Lampoon Vacations are a staple for most holidays in our home. But if you want to see the true mark of this man's sweetness  there are two small roles in other peoples pictures that I love.  In Knocked Up he plays the perfect dad to his son Seth Rogan showing him that despite his screw ups he is still very much loved.  And in the movie here As Good As It Gets he plays the ""gift Doctor"" who changes the life of a sick childs family.  When he appears at their apartment you feel vicariously their relief and happiness.  Ramis perfectly portrays a man who is shy and embarassed by the attention but you trust he will make their lives ""much better from now on"".  It was a perfect role for him because he made our lives much better bringing laughter into the life of millions.

The plot of a man with OCD and a struggling waitress builds brilliantly as the movie continues.  As much as many may dislike the lead man, he is highly laughable.  Such comedy combines well with drama at the right places to give it the added flavor.  It combines attitude, laughter, romance, and family.  This movie rightfully earned seven Oscar nominations including Best Picture.Two of those nominations became winners: Jack Nicholson for Best Actor and Helen Hunt for Best Actress.  Nicholson's role has the intensity that gives this film the added comedy.  His research into his character's disease and his characteristics showcase very well.  As always, no words can express how terrific his acting is.  Helen Hunt's role gives the film the drama it needs without removing the comedy.  Her performance is enough to make an audience cry.  Greg Kinnear's Oscar nominated role as a depressed gay man is one of the best performances of his career.  All the other actors also performed wonderfully: Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich, Cuba Gooding Jr., and many more(even the dog).""As Good As It Gets"" is a great movie for those who are looking for a unique comedy.

I also bring this up because Nicholson won the Oscar for this role when he didn't bring home the gold for better work, but that's the nature of the beast.  Helen Hunt, on the other hand, gave the best screen performance of her career as the struggling waitress who relunctantly allows herself to fall in love with Nicholson's headcase.  I remember when this film came out that I found it implausible that Hunt could fall for Nicholson's character.  The women I related this to who had seen the film were emphatic that she could, that woman are not as superficial as men in that regard.  Such is my knowledge of the opposite sex.  It should also be noted that good work is delivered by Greg Kinnear as a gay artist, a change of pace for him from the usual cads he plays as well as Cuba Gooding Jr. as an art dealer.

The issue is whether Jack Nicholson is best actor or whether the award is for best performance by an actor.The award is, in fact given for best performance. With Jack Nicholson, you get the same person in every movie but wow, he sure plays that person well. What I mean is that John Wayne played a certain type of personality, so did James Stewart and many others. They were great actors but their range was limited. They could not affect accents and play personalities far beyond those for which they were generally cast. So to with Nicholson, you are always aware that it is Nicholson playing the role and, in effect, he is bigger than the role he is playing. You never truly believe that he is the character he is playing because you can never become unaware that he is Jack Nicholson. I would contrast this with someone like Tim Robbins who can play an emotionally empty victim of childhood sexual abuse in Mystic River, an entirely different role than he played as the cocky pitcher in Bull Durham. You forget that it is Robbins and believe you are seeing the incarnation of the character he is playing.In this movie, Nicholson is an offbeat crumudgeon (hmmm, has he ever done that before?). He is a writer named Melvin who spends most of his time in his apartment working. He lives near a gay artist and has an obsessive/compulsive need to eat at the same restaurant and be served by the same waitress every day. He is nothing short of nasty to his neighbor and he is callous and demanding to the waitress (played by Helen Hunt who also wins an Oscar). A set of circumstances arises which gets him dragooned into taking care of his neighbor's dog when the neighbor is hospitalized. He grows fond of the dog, thus gets drawn into this neighbor's life. He also get's drawn into the waitress's life when he needs to resort to extraordinary efforts to keep her working at the restaurant to satisfy his compulsion to be served at the same table, every day, by the same waitress.Predictably enough, being drawn into the lives of others mellows Melvin. The three end up in an adventure in which they travel together to Maryland and the relationship between Melvin and the waitress devolves into a romatic comedy. Anyway, Nicholson is great as Melvin. Nicholson is perfect for the role and there's the rub. Just as John Wayne was perfect for the role of a gunslinger out west, so to Nicholson is perfect for this offbeat role. Thus, I reprise my question about an Oscar for a role that the actor is almost typecast for. Nicholson won a previous best actor Oscar for One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest. As incredibly good as he is in his roles, does he deserve a second Oscar for playing his persona spectacularly well yet again?

10738,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0767811100,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 2]","Brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and cleanly directed, this strange and wonderful tale is one of the best romantic comedies ever to hit the silver screen. Helen Hunt, as an unmarried thirtysomething waitress with a asthmatic five-year-old boy, is exquisite. Jack Nicholson, as a weird and mean obsessive/compulsive writer named Melvin Udall, is even better than he usually is, and he is one of the great actors of our time, and even Greg Kinnear in a supporting role as the sensitive gay guy next door is outstanding.Of course I love impossible love, unrequited love, love that takes decades to culmination. This is a case of impossible love come true. Eat your heart out Nora Ephron! And you too Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. But I couldn't help but think, considering the principals, how impossible it really is on another level. But never mind, in fact, all the better.James L. Brooks, who directed and who, along with Mark Andrus (from his story) wrote the script, is to be highly commended. The concept of an obsessive/compulsive, self-centered (almost autistic) older guy, set in his ways beyond anything normal finding love is just wondrous strange. And a patient and caring, under-achieving, under-appreciated Manhattan waitress in a house dress, finding not just love but somebody who really knows who she is and what she's worth is also just wonderful.Wonderful, yes. A wonderful movie to lift the spirit. But As Good As It Gets is more than that. The dialogue is sharp and witty and big-city sophisticated and sometimes laugh out loud funny. The underlying statements about relationships and love in urban America are subtle and thought-provoking. So much is said beside the point. Yes, off to the side we find some street hustlers juxtaposed with someone sensitive, and we see how irrelevant they are and how he overcomes them and this brutal thing they have done to him. And off to the side we see again how irrelevant is the homophobia of a man lost in prejudice and self-hatred, and how it changes when he becomes aware and when he learns to love.The ancient rule in comedy, from the Greeks to Shakespeare to the musical comedy of the stage to the romantic comedies of the silver screen, has been young and attractive principals overcome obstacles and live happily ever after. Here we have obstacles of the most tiring sort, obstacles not of class or race or family, but of psychological problems, stuff straight out of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders--although to be technical, the symptoms of Melvin Udall are a cornucopia of psychiatric delight. The bitter, cutting, hateful insults that he showers on everyone, even his most devoted admirers, seem more characteristic of Tourette's Syndrome than of a obsessive/compulsive disorder. But never mind. It works. In fact everything works in this movie, from the adorable little dog whom Melvin loves (&quot;A dog...a blanky-blanky dog!&quot; [who has captured his heart] he tells us in amazement), to Greg Kinnear's character's friend (Cuba Gooding) trying to act tough, to Shirley Knight in a bit part as Helen Hunt's character's mother, to the cute little boy with asthma.However--and this is a big however--this movie is not for everybody, which accounts for some of the nasty reviews below. But ignore them. Trust me.

10739,AZ1H3VLCDR298,0767811100,Derrick Thomas,"[4, 4]","This movie is absolutely one of the best movies to come around in a long time. It goes down to the deepest levels of the human spirit, and triumphs. Jack Nicholson gives his best performance since &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; and really shows us that anybody can become a better person. He plays a romance novelist who has Obessesive Compulsive Disorder with an attitude less than human at times. People around him think he is just another jerk, but with his disorder he is usually not aware he is offending people, until it is too late. I have OCD myself, and after having seen this movie with my family, I have been compared to him in many ways. I can control it most of the time now, but this Nicholson's character Melvin Yudall does not realize he is affecting people negatively (or even cares) until late in his life. He is really just a lonely man with no friends, who isolates himself in his apartment when he writes, and has very little social skills. Greg Kinnear plays his neighbor who dislikes him greatly, for reasons shown in the film.(Kinnear gives an outstanding performance and should have won the Oscar for best supporting actor that year) He plays a man who after a brutal attack directed at him must come to grips with himself again and regain his self-worth. Also featured is Helen Hunt, who gives a wonderful performance as the waitress who waits on Nicholson at his favorite diner. The character development grows between Nicholson and Hunt and Kinnear and Nicholson until eventually all three story lines intersect. Some of you may not have seen this film yet, so I won't give away any of the details. But let me tell you as someone who has been there, and has felt the same feelings and desires as Melvin, that this movie gave me a lot of inspiration and hope that I pray will be felt by many others with the same situation. This is a feel-good movie, with rich, detailed characters portrayed by actors who fit into the roles like a glove. This movie was nominated for many oscars, but this was the Year of Titanic, and pulled away with best actor and actress nods for Nicholson and Hunt. When you watch this movie, you actually feel for these 3 people, and you want them to be happy with their lives, which is what's missing from many movies these days. James L. Brooks, who is at his finest, co-wrote and directed this movie with such spirit.

This is as true of his role as Melvin, a misanthrope with a severe case of OCD, in ""As Good as it Gets,"" as it is of any of his other starring roles.At the start we find Melvin, a highly reclusive though extremely successful author, living alone in an apartment. His one real problem (beyond his OCD) is Simon (Greg Kinnear), his gay neighbor who has an annoying little dog whom Melvin hates. Melvin's only meaningful activity outside his apartment is to eat breakfast at a local cafe, where he insists on being served by Carol (Helen Hunt), a single mom who is eking out a living on her wages and tips.Over time Melvin finds himself increasingly attracted to Carol, and when she leaves her job at the cafe he tracks her down. Eventually he becomes romantically involved with her, despite the extreme discomfort this causes him because of his OCD.Although the movie is billed as a comedy and does have its funny moments, it is far more profound and poignant than is the typical comedy.

Since that time story tellers have repeated the tale with many variations, but it remains basically the same: Love Conquers All.

The whole idea that Helen Hunt's character, a tough-minded single mom and waitress, would fall for Jack Nicholson's vitriolic author thirty years her elder really stretches the bounds of believeability.  Maybe hooking up with a wealthy but pathetic and lonely old man would be in the short-term interest of her sickly son, but there's no other visible reason for her to be interested in him.  The movie tries to give her the motivation of redeeming him when he wows her with &quot;You make me want to be a better man&quot;, but it seems contrived that she would even bother with this jerk who has been bitter and rude to people for longer than she has been alive.I know the age difference is supposed to be secondary to the idea that these are two lost souls who might be able to lean on each other; maybe I would have believed the romance if Helen Hunt's character would have been developed more fully.On the other hand, Nicholson's obsessive-compulsive Archie-Bunker-esque character was the most entertaining part of the movie for me.  Sure, you know he's going to get his comeuppance at some point, and show that he's got a heart of gold underneath, but he was so unlikeable, I had to like him.  Some of these other reviewers are claiming that it's no big deal for Nicholson to play this part, since it's just like his real life persona, but even if this is true I still think it takes some guts to portray a racist, sexist, homophobic freakazoid, and talent to make the character waver between knee-jerk rudeness and lonely humanity.",2,Implausibility ruined it for me,1011052800,"01 15, 2002",2002,1696,"[""'d"", 'heard', 'lots', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'saw', 'was', 'disappointed', 'never', 'believed', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'whole', 'idea', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'character', 'tough-minded', 'single', 'mom', 'waitress', 'would', 'fall', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'vitriolic', 'author', 'thirty', 'years', 'elder', 'really', 'bounds', 'believeability', 'Maybe', 'hooking', 'up', 'wealthy', 'pathetic', 'lonely', 'old', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'short-term', 'interest', 'sickly', 'son', 'other', 'visible', 'reason', 'be', 'interested', 'movie', 'give', 'motivation', 'redeeming', 'when', 'quot', 'make', 'want', 'be', 'better', 'man', 'quot', 'contrived', 'would', 'even', 'bother', 'jerk', 'who', 'been', 'bitter', 'rude', 'people', 'longer', 'been', 'alive.I', 'know', 'age', 'difference', 'supposed', 'be', 'secondary', 'idea', 'are', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'lean', 'other', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'believed', 'romance', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'more', 'fully.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Nicholson', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'Archie-Bunker-esque', 'character', 'was', 'most', 'entertaining', 'part', 'movie', 'Sure', 'know', 'going', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'point', 'show', 'got', 'heart', 'gold', 'underneath', 'was', 'so', 'unlikeable', 'had', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'claiming', 'big', 'deal', 'Nicholson', 'play', 'part', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'persona', 'even', 'true', 'still', 'think', 'guts', 'portray', 'racist', 'sexist', 'homophobic', 'freakazoid', 'talent', 'make', 'character', 'waver', 'knee-jerk', 'rudeness', 'lonely', 'humanity']",N/A

It is a story of human relationships, of love and friendship, of new beginnings, and of how people can conquer their fears,  how people can change.  taking place in New York city in a fairly trendy  part of town, this story concerns Melvin (Jack Nicholson), an  obsessive-compulsive, foul-mouthed and successful author; Carol (Helen  Hunt), a kind, burnt-out waitress whose life literally revolves around her  devastatingly allergic son; and Melvin's neighbor, Simon (Greg Kinnear), a  brilliant and sensitive painter who, after being beaten during a burglary  in his house, loses everything he has, including his self-confidence.  How  these people meet, connect and react to each other is a stroke of  screenwriting genius, producing a hilarious and touching story that I feel  should have won best picture over Titanic.  Nicholson and Hunt readily  deserved their Oscars for their exceptional performances, and I believe  that Kinnear also deserved a win.

Cuba Gooding, Jr (Jerry MaGuire), Greg Kinnear (Nurse Betty) and Shirley Knight (The Group) supply some good supporting acting. The script and direction by James L.

But it's Helen Hunt's performance that raises this film yet another notch.

In this film he's a screwball obsessive-compulsive who hates everyone except his waitress, Helen Hunt. They barely tolerate each other. This misanthrope hates his gay neighbor Greg Kinnear and the guy's little pooch who nearly steals the movie. Jack drops the dog in the garbage shoot of their apartment building.Jack mugs, sulks, gloats, and turns his face into a myriad of reactions. He has plenty of money so he is able to manipulate people. When Kinnear gets badly beaten up, Jack ends up taking care of the mutt which is the beginning of his conversion. It is the story of how he rejoins the human race by helping out Helen and Greg who infuse humanity into this creep.It's a movie with a lot of laughs brought on by one of the biggest hams in the business. This flick, without him, let's say with Robin Williams, could have turned into a saccharine, schmaltzy, gooey mess.

10785,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,0767811100,"John ""MovieAddict""","[3, 5]","""How do you rate women so well?"" asks a flattered young lady after reading one of the man's sappy romantic paperback novels and recognizing his face on the street. He turns around, looks at her and says, ""I think of a man, and I take away reason and accountability.""The secret of ""As Good As It Gets"" is its unconventional, and often times irreverent, view of the entire romance scene. It is centered solely on two people, Melvin (Jack Nicholson) and Carol (Helen Hunt). Melvin writes those corny romance novels you always manage to find tucked in between the fiction and non-fiction area of your local bookstore. You know, the kind that little old ladies like to read through at an incredible speed in an ill-fated hope to re-live moments of their past.Melvin is a bit like Paul Sheldon, from Rob Reiner's ""Misery,"" although I'm sure if he had been found by a murderous fan he would have been killed early on--he's incredibly blunt and annoying. He probably would have told Annie Wilkes what he thought of her from the get-go, not hesitating any more than he has to.Melvin has obsessive-compulsive disorder, which basically means he goes through strange routines every time he does something, whether it means locking a door twice or not stepping on the cracks of a sidewalk (we all do that, sometimes). I recently read a new Steve Martin novella about a man with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and it reminded me very much of ""As Good As It Gets"" and the Melvin character. Melvin is such a wacko that he pushes his gay neighbor's dog down the laundry chute after he finds it wandering around the hallway.The gay man is played by Greg Kinnear. His name is Simon, and he has a small little dog he likes to call ""precious."" Simon is an artist, but when a band of kids wreck his apartment and beat him up, he is left with the realization that he hasn't enough money to keep his flat, and his boyfriend (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) may break up with him.But the biggest worry of all is...what to do with his precious?Frank, played by Gooding Jr., decides to give the dog to Melvin--who refuses at first but is left without any option but to obey. He soon achieves a certain subtle love for the beast, and when Simon has healed and comes back for the dog, it doesn't even want to leave. It even starts to develop nasty habits--like avoiding cracks in the sidewalk.Meanwhile, a troubled single mother and a part-time waitress, Carol is constantly nagged by Melvin. Only she can deliver him food. Only she can take his order. Only she can kick him out of the restaurant. Mistaking this for some sort of sexual craving, she tells Melvin flat-out that she will never sleep with him. He doesn't seem to care. That had never even crossed his mind.The fact is that Melvin is insufferably lonely. He likes to act as though he likes to be lonely, but the truth is that his loneliness is something he loathes. He would love to reach out and gain some friends--but he's too proud to humble himself in such a way. We all know people like Melvin--he just takes himself to a new extreme.Melvin is surely one of the great screen characters of all time, ranking up there with Raymond ""Rain Man"" Babbitt and Forrest Gump as some of the most unique and likable inventions to ever grace the big screen. Nicholson presents his character in an especially effective way--at first he seems gruff, then he seems strange, then his soft side is revealed, and he slowly becomes the likable mean guy who lives upstairs and likes to try and kill neighbors' dogs.Hunt won the Oscar for her work in ""As Good As It Gets,"" but it was truly Nicholson who deserved it.Regardless of all this, ""As Good As It Gets"" still stands alone as one of the cleverest romantic comedies of all time, and certainly one that both sexes can agree on. The film features some of the most memorable lines ever written on paper, the majority of them all coming from the lips of Melvin Udall, perfectly spoken by a typical gruff Jack Nicholson. They all come off as utterly hilarious and convincing. (Nicholson: ""How old are you? If I would guess by your eyes, I'd say you're fifty."" Hunt: ""If I went by your eyes I'd say you were kind."")This is the type of new-age romantic comedy that rivals the greatness of ""When Harry Met Sally"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle."" It's founded in its characters, their lives, their interaction, and how they learn to overcome their own personal obstacles and moral obligations. This film carries all the Autumn-time sweetness and cleverness of a Rob Reiner comedy, and all the lightness of a Frank Capra movie. It's a delightful blend of comedy and romance, and the type of redefining genre motion picture that ""When Harry Met Sally"" was eight years prior.What a perfect, delightful movie.",5,Delightfully perfect!,1075852800,"02 4, 2004",2004,4750,"['How', 'do', 'rate', 'women', 'so', 'well', 'flattered', 'young', 'lady', 'reading', 'one', 'man', 'sappy', 'romantic', 'paperback', 'novels', 'recognizing', 'face', 'street', 'around', 'think', 'man', 'take', 'away', 'reason', 'accountability', 'secret', 'As', 'Good', 'Gets', 'unconventional', 'often', 'times', 'irreverent', 'view', 'entire', 'romance', 'scene', 'centered', 'solely', 'two', 'people', 'Melvin', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Carol', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Melvin', 'corny', 'romance', 'novels', 'always', 'manage', 'find', 'tucked', 'fiction', 'non-fiction', 'area', 'local', 'bookstore', 'know', 'kind', 'little', 'old', 'ladies', 'read', 'incredible', 'speed', 'ill-fated', 'hope', 're-live', 'moments', 'past.Melvin', 'bit', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Misery', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'been', 'found', 'murderous', 'fan', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'early', 'incredibly', 'blunt', 'annoying', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'what', 'thought', 'get-go', 'not', 'hesitating', 'more', 'to.Melvin', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'basically', 'strange', 'routines', 'time', 'something', 'locking', 'door', 'twice', 'not', 'stepping', 'cracks', 'sidewalk', 'do', 'sometimes', 'recently', 'read', 'new', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'novella', 'man', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'reminded', 'very', 'much', 'As', 'Good', 'Melvin', 'character', 'Melvin', 'such', 'wacko', 'gay', 'neighbor', 'dog', 'laundry', 'chute', 'wandering', 'hallway.The', 'gay', 'man', 'played', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'name', 'Simon', 'small', 'little', 'dog', 'call', 'precious', 'Simon', 'artist', 'when', 'band', 'kids', 'wreck', 'apartment', 'beat', 'up', 'left', 'realization', ""n't"", 'enough', 'money', 'keep', 'flat', 'boyfriend', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'may', 'break', 'up', 'biggest', 'worry', 'what', 'do', 'precious', 'Frank', 'played', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'give', 'dog', 'Melvin', 'who', 'first', 'left', 'option', 'obey', 'soon', 'certain', 'subtle', 'love', 'beast', 'when', 'Simon', 'healed', 'back', 'dog', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'leave', 'even', 'develop', 'nasty', 'habits', 'avoiding', 'cracks', 'sidewalk.Meanwhile', 'troubled', 'single', 'mother', 'part-time', 'waitress', 'Carol', 'constantly', 'nagged', 'Melvin', 'Only', 'can', 'deliver', 'food', 'Only', 'can', 'take', 'order', 'Only', 'can', 'kick', 'restaurant', 'Mistaking', 'sort', 'sexual', 'craving', 'Melvin', 'flat-out', 'will', 'never', 'sleep', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'crossed', 'mind.The', 'fact', 'Melvin', 'insufferably', 'lonely', 'act', 'be', 'lonely', 'truth', 'loneliness', 'something', 'would', 'love', 'reach', 'out', 'gain', 'friends', 'too', 'proud', 'humble', 'way', 'know', 'people', 'Melvin', 'just', 'new', 'extreme.Melvin', 'surely', 'one', 'great', 'screen', 'characters', 'time', 'ranking', 'up', 'there', 'Raymond', 'Rain', 'Man', 'Babbitt', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'most', 'unique', 'likable', 'inventions', 'ever', 'grace', 'big', 'screen', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'especially', 'effective', 'way', 'first', 'gruff', 'then', 'strange', 'then', 'soft', 'side', 'revealed', 'slowly', 'likable', 'mean', 'guy', 'who', 'upstairs', 'likes', 'try', 'kill', 'neighbors', 'dogs.Hunt', 'won', 'Oscar', 'work', 'As', 'Good', 'was', 'truly', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'deserved', 'it.Regardless', 'As', 'Good', 'still', 'alone', 'one', 'cleverest', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'time', 'certainly', 'one', 'sexes', 'can', 'agree', 'film', 'most', 'memorable', 'lines', 'ever', 'written', 'paper', 'majority', 'coming', 'lips', 'Melvin', 'Udall', 'perfectly', 'spoken', 'typical', 'gruff', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'come', 'off', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'convincing', 'Nicholson', 'How', 'old', 'are', 'would', 'guess', 'eyes', ""'d"", 'say', ""'re"", 'fifty', 'Hunt', 'went', 'eyes', ""'d"", 'say', 'were', 'kind', 'type', 'new-age', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'greatness', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'founded', 'characters', 'lives', 'interaction', 'how', 'learn', 'overcome', 'own', 'personal', 'obstacles', 'moral', 'obligations', 'film', 'Autumn-time', 'sweetness', 'cleverness', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'comedy', 'lightness', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'movie', 'delightful', 'blend', 'comedy', 'romance', 'type', 'redefining', 'genre', 'motion', 'picture', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'was', 'eight', 'years', 'perfect', 'delightful', 'movie']",N/A

The cast is mismatched, to be sure:  placing a heavyweight like Jack Nocholson alongside Helen (who?) Hunt and Greg Kinnear would seem funny itself if it wasn't exactly what they did.  And the writing is much, much better than OK.My reflection, though, is on how media portry OCD.  ""Monk"" has given tv viewers a sense of the disease as played out by the title character.  It almost seems as though Monk's OCD helps him solve cases and is better at his job.This film focuses more on OCD as a disease, which is what it is.  Nicholson is successful and productive, but deeply unhappy and chained to his disorder. The ""salvation"" depicted in this movie is how personal relationships can help an enslaved person escape the bonds of OCD.It's a great movie with great performances, and was drenched with Oscars as a result.

It is sometimes called a romantic comedy and it certainly has its share of both laughs and romance.  It is also a disturbing drama focusing on an obsessive compulsive (Jack Nicholson) and his attempt to improve his lot in life.  But whatever you choose to call it, this is one excellent film.  The script features dialog that is so well done it should be mandatory to study it in film schools across the country.  The cast is outstanding from top to bottom.  All the actors involve give performances that are at least equal to and probably better than anything else they've ever done.  I would suspect that they all recognized how exceptional the script was and wanted to do it justice.The story is fairly involved but focuses primarily on Jack Nicholson and his neighbor (Greg Kinnear).  While Nicholson starts off highly antagonistic toward Kinnear, this begins to change after the latter is viciously beaten and injured.  Nicholson also pursues a romance with Helen Hunt's character.  All of this may seem straightforward but Nicholson portrays one of the rudest, most unlikable men ever to play leading man... yet somehow infuses him with enough humanity that we can't help but root for him.  He may be mean and selfish but he's trying to be less mean and selfish and that counts for a lot as the story moves forward.  I won't give any more of the plot away but suffice to say that it is fascinating to watch all of this unfold on screen.As Good As It Gets is much more demanding of its audience than a typical film.

Directed by James L Brooks yes the same guy from The Simpsons movie he also directed Terms Of Enderment. It stars Jack Nicholson as Melvin, Helen Hunt as Carol Connelly, Greg Kinnar as Simon Bishop,  Cuba Gooding jr as Frank & Jesse James as Spencer Connelly.  Story is Melvin is obsessive compulsive novelist he doesn't get along with his neighbors in his apartment & he also hates his G  a  y neighbor Simon's dog & throws it down a shute into the garbage. When he's confronted on it Jack Nicholson gets some hilarious verbal ownage in "" Never interrupt me again ok? Not if there is a fire not even if you hear the sound of a thud & ! week later there is a stench so bad that you have to hold a hanky over your face cause the stench is  from a decaying body. Even if it's election night & some fudge pa  c  k  er you date has been elected the 1st qu  e  e  r President of The US & he's on his way to Camp David & you want someone to share the moment with. Even then don't come knocking. Not for ANY reason. Do you get that sweetheart."" It's like they wrote it for Jack Nicholson inn mind. He eats breakfast at the same restaurant every morning at the same table he has an interest in this waitress Carol Connelly she's the only 1 that tolerates him eventually she finds out what kind of man he is. His neighbor Simon was robbed by these thugs & beaten up pretty bad & has to go to the hospital his agent Frank forces him to take care of his dog.  Melvin becomes attached to the dog. Carol has a son Spencer he's acutely asthmatic Carol decides to get a job closer to home he can't adjust to the new waitress. He actually pays for the medical bills to get him the treatment he needs. Simon who is recuperating has lost his artistic will & close to being evicted. Frank asks Melvin to drive Simon to Baltimore to ask his parents for money. Melvin invites Carol to go she reluctantly agrees to go. From there we get some good character development & these people aren't perfect the portrayal is real. Melvin & Simon have a great back & forth. Like when Simon talks about his troubled childhood Melvin responds "" Some of us have great stories pretty stories that take place on lakes & boats & Noodle Salad. Just no one in this car. But a lot of people that's their story good times noodle salad. What makes it so hard is not that you had it so bad but so many others had it good."" You know I could go on & on but the performances are really good Jack Nicholson was great. Helen Hunt could be b  it  c  h  ybut she was still pretty good.

10809,A3B90F5YX0SU0N,0767811100,L. Johnson,"[4, 5]","First and foremost, the best thing about this movie...Melvin Udall.  Not Jack Nicholson, but Melvin Udall, the main character.  Nicholson is brilliant, and his performance in this movie was no different, but the  character of Melvin is pure genius and is clearly the biggest reason for  the success of this movie.  He has some of the best one-liners I've ever  heard, but his character also has incredible depth, and can be analyzed  over and over again.  Very well-rounded, and just so I don't take anything  away from Nicholson...very well-acted.Some liked Helen Hunt in this  movie, some apparently didn't.  I thought she did a great job.  In As Good  As It Gets, she masters the actor's art of making it seem like she wasn't  acting at all.  I have no objection at all for the fact that she won the  Oscar; I found it well-deserved.Greg Kinnear rounds out the &quot;big  3&quot; by putting in a great performance as well.  Playing the gay  neighbor of the main character isn't exactly an easy role to pull off; add  to that the fact that he also has to undergo a subtle character  transformation during this movie, and I think Kinnear deserves a lot of  credit.If there is one knock on this movie that I agree with, it's the  complaint that the romance isn't believable.  Melvin is an extremely  likeable character, but as you will discover if you haven't seen this movie  yet, most of his humor stems from his crass and tactless nature...aside  from a couple of nice romantic lines, I personally was left scratching my  head as to how Carol (Helen Hunt) could fall in love with this  man.Still, the positives of this movie far outweigh the negatives...it  is hilarious as a comedy, and touching and thought-provoking as a drama.  If you haven't seen it yet, see it immediately...if you have seen it and  liked it, don't hesitate to buy it.

10816,A129YBX5BVNW2,0767811100,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 0]","Melvin is a bit of a boor. And that's not even taking into account that he's full of crap too. Ensconced in his plush 5th Avenue apartment  - famous and wealthy author Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) sits in front of his beautifully lit computer. Speaking softly and eloquently to himself as he composes the revelatory ending of his 62nd book - he types warm words about love and deep relationships. The only problem is that in the real world Melvin sucks at both with the ferocity of a gummy budgie on several uppers.Then there's the compulsive behaviour he indulges in privately and publicly because he's a bank account that afford it - foil-wrapped bars of soap he uses only once (tapping the cabinet mirror each time he opens a new one) and leather gloves he bins after one outing. Mountains of expensive LPs all lined up in perfect alphabetical order - luxurious foot platters in the fridge in shrinkwrap that he won't eat. In fact compulsion dominates his every action - locks on his door that have to be turned back and forth five times followed by the light switches. He can't cross cracks in paving stones when he's out on the New York streets and can't abide anyone touching him (""get a life"" one pedestrian cries). He carries plastic knives and forks with him in sealed bags because eating off immaculate silverware is a ""judgement call"". But these rituals are small beer to his motor mouth - that more often than not - would make an open drain seem fragrant.""I've got Jews on my table!"" Melvin protests when a man and a woman are found sitting where he always sits (early roles for Peter Jacobson and Lisa Edelstein - Dr. Taub and Dr. Cuddy in Hugh Laurie's ""House""). He calls gay men ""fudge-packers"" while a coloured Art Agent has an ""accent thick with molasses..."" ""Sell crazy some place else!"" he tells the cleaning lady who wishes him God in his life. He calls an overweight waitress ""elephant girl"" and screams ""Now!"" at her to get his food - finally getting himself barred for life from his favourite eating hole to the applause of every single patron. But worse than his uncontrollable verbal diarrhoea is his persistent obnoxious behaviour - acts so unfeeling - they'd make The Hitler Youth tremble with pride.There's his gay neighbour Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear) - an idealistic painter who obsessively worships his small fluffy dog Verdell - so Melvin chucks the tiny Brussels Griffin down the garbage chute for urinating on the hall radiator (""wizzed for the last time you dirty dog!""). On a visit to his publisher a worshiping secretary foolishly asks, ""How do you write women so well?"" Unable to resist Melvin replies, ""I think of a man - and take away all reason and accountability..."" Even the warm-hearted waitress Carol Connolly (Helen Hunt) who works at CAF&Eacute; (the only restaurant he'll use in Manhattan) - the one person in the whole wide world who will put up with his God awful mannerisms and impatience - is having a hard time not poking his eyes with a red hot poker after a staggeringly offhand and cold remark about her sick Asthmatic son.Both Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt won the Oscar for 1997's ""As Good As It Gets"" - and not without reason. They're simply fabulous in their roles as polar opposite people - weary souls who long for release from their respective personal prisons. But for my money the writing of Mark Andrus and Director James L. Brooks should have pulled a statue too. The movie has a ballbreakingly funny script that relishes in the attack - but also knows when to turn on the heart. Melvin shouts as a cackle of school kids on the sidewalk - ""Children Stop!"" - and all do in abject terror. When Dr. Bettes (the wonderful Harold Ramis) tells working-mum Carol that her sick son Spencer will now suffer less from his breathing problems and allergies because Melvin has stumped up $61,000 in medical bills to get her back to work and waiting on him - it's funny, moving and beautiful. It drew tears in our house.The CAF&Eacute; scene where Carol tries to explain her gratitude for the miracle of life Melvin has given her son - is tender and awkward and genuinely touching - and his response of ""lovely"" (when he just wants her to stop) is so utterly on the money for his character's inner demons. When they do finally have dinner together on a car trip to Baltimore to raise cash from Simon's rich parents (he's broke and needs to keep his apartment) - Melvin pays Carol a real compliment for the first time (dialogue above) and a softer better person emerges.Even as a seasoned watcher - you forget just how good Jack Nicholson really is. In full flight - he's an awesome thing to see and his character's awfulness towards all of humanity is a wonder to behold. And yet you love him - monumental prick that he is - he gives his Melvin a beating heart. Not to be outdone on the robbed-of-an-Oscar front - I'd also state that another statue should have been handed out to Greg Kinnear as sensitive Simon in what has to be a career-best performance from him. Having been beaten to a facial pulp by a model that cased his soft touch place for a robbery (Skeet Ulrich) - the scene where he's out of hospital and breaks down in front of Nicholson in his apartment is stupendous - and was shown at the Oscar ceremonies. It took real boots to go up against a consummate scene-stealer like JN and our Greg pulled it off convincingly. Look closely too and you'll catch a few lines by the author of Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back (and the new one too), Raiders Of The Lost Ark and The Big Chill - Lawrence Kasdan - making an appearance as Dr. Green in Melvin's Fifth Avenue Psychiatric Group.Defaulted to Aspect Ratio 1.85:1 - the picture fills the entire screen and is gorgeous throughout. Only on a very few occasions do faces go slightly out of focus - mostly it just looks like quality all the way. I bought the German Region B version (Besser Geht's Nicht on Barcode 4030521707481) that has the Region ABC Logo on the rear - meaning it's all regions or region free. A very real let down however is the complete absence of any Extras - not even a Trailer for God's sake. I say this because I've long raved about the commentary that accompanies the whole film on the DVD release where Nicholson gives it some seriously informative and funny raconteur throughout ""I'm upstaged by a f***ing dog!"" What a shame it isn't on here. Subtitles are extensive too.There are some Directors I will seek out - Terry Gilliam, Wes Anderson, Nadine Labaki, Peter Howitt, John Borman, Peter Chelsom, Mira Nair, Paul Haggis, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, Paul Greengrass, Nadine Lahti and James L. Brooks are among them. They produce movies of depth, wit and hope - and the brill ""As Good As It Gets"" is right up there.""You make me want to be a better person..."" Melvin says to Carol in a rare moment of genuine breakthrough.Make your home a sweeter place too by adding this dysfunctional nugget of love to your shopping basket...",5,"""...A Better Person..."" -

Never one of my favorites, I always felt Nicholson just kept playing the same roles over and over.  But in his awesome performance in A FEW GOOD MEN, I finally saw what the critics and Oscar voters had already seen:  the man is an incredibly gifted actor.  In AS GOOD AS IT GETS, for which he won a Best Actor award, Nicholson parlays all of his usual tics and gestures into a superb portrait of an obsessive-compulsive man afraid of living life, and most definitely afraid of becoming involved with other people.  He is overtly nasty and one would never believe there was a real human being underneath all that venom.  However, once he ""babysits"" his neighbors precious pooch, we see a side of Melvin that lets us know there IS a real person beneat that cynically oppressive facade.  It's to Nicholson's credit that as he goes through the movie making mistake after mistake, we really hope he gets the girl in the end.  Helen Hunt in her Oscar winning performance is marvelous; she exudes an everyday commonality and a warmth rare in many of our actresses today.  While it's hard to believe she and Nicholson would ever hook up, Hunt's performance is so astutely controlled, we forget she's acting.  And Greg Kinnear (so good in Nurse Betty) is a revelation as the homosexual neighbor, Simon.  While not totally eschewing the stereotypical effeminance of homsexuality, Kinner displays a leading man swagger with the vulnerability of a lifestyle that can be challenging to say the least.  Kinnear was nominated for a supporting actor award, and he is definitely worthy of that nomination in this superbly nuanced performance.

10827,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,0767811100,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","Jack Nicholson is at the top of his game as Melvin Udall, a successful romance novelist.  Melvin lives in an exclusive apartment in New York's Manhattan and is the scourge of the neighborhood.  He is afflicted with obsessive compulsive disorder but unlike many with the malady he acts out his self-centered narcissism with mean and cruel verbiage.  His across-the-hall neighbor is a gay contemporary artist named Simon (Greg Kinnear) who is a primary receiver of Melvin's hurtful jabs.  The only other person Melvin can relate to is a single mother of an asthmatic boy who is also the only waitress at a nearby diner that will wait on him.This unlikely trio come together thanks for a cute and well trained little dog named Verdell.  Melvin reluctantly cares for the pooch after his owner Simon is severely beaten by burglars.  He falls for the dog which gives him the opportunity to become friendly with his neighbor.  Melvin agrees to drive Simon to Baltimore to see his parents for money, as his art work isn't selling.  Melvin asks waitress Carol (nice work from Helen Hunt) to go along.  She feels obligated since Melvin had given her access to a top doctor who is now treating her son.  The trip doesn't go all that well for Melvin and Carol.  Both need companionship and more but Melvin's dickish personality continually gets in the way.  One of the great lines in the movie is when Carol fishes for a complement from Melvin at dinner.  She had gotten dressed up and was expecting something along the lines of how nice she looked.  Instead after minutes of deflection, Melvin says to her ""You make me want to be a better man.""  He then crushes the moment with something about her wearing a housedress after he bought a new suit.  Carol does strike up a nice relationship with Simon back at the hotel, even agreeing to pose nude for him.  Simon's energy and creativity returns.  But...well, he's still gay.This film won a Golden Globe for Best Picture in 1997 in addition to awards for Nicholson and Hunt.  The acting is complemented by Shirley Knight as Carol's mom, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Simon's agent and Skeet Ulrich as a model for Simon who eventually turns on him.  It is well written and directed by James L. Brooks with writing help from Mark Andrus.  The movie could have easily turned sappy as Melvin becomes nicer.  He never quite makes it but the ending gives us hope.

I was pleasantly surprised.Jack Nicholson plays Melvin Udell, a compulsive obsessive writer.  Everything in is live is constant from how he locks his door to having the same table at his corner restaurant.  This is a typical quirky Nicholson role but the difference is that this character grows throughout the film.Helen Hunt plays Carol Connelly, the only waitress that Melvin will allow to wait on him.  Everything in her live is chaos from her job to her chronically ill son.  This is a tour de force performance.  She gets to show the gamut of emotion during this film.Greg Kinnear plays Nicholson's neighbor Simon Bishop.  Melvin shows no restraint in his distaste of Simon's lifestyle.  This is Kinnear's breakout performance.When Simon is beaten up, Melvin is forced into his life.  Melvin forces his way intoCarol's life when her son condition worsens.  In the end, Melvin uses Simon's need to visit his parents to get Carol to come on the road trip.  This road trip is the best part of the film.  Each character is forced to grow a little and has some of the best one liners.The only problem with this film is to accurately classify it.  It starts out as a social comedy but develops into a romantic comedy.

Originally, I was rooting for Robert Duvall to win the best actor award, but after seeing this three times and analyzing the performance, I definitely agree with Jack Nicholson's win.  He is such a model of a miserable, despicable person, and yet you see little flicks of expression that reveal the real person within, the person he is trying to repress because he is more comfortable with people wanting nothing to do with him than he would be if he were liked.However, you can not fool a dog, even if you try to dump him down the chute for the trash.  And the dog is definitely one of the major factors enabling the good person within the Nicholson character to surface.There's a lot to be said for this film, but basically, it's been said.  I will say that I've watched it four times now and each time, find something I missed before.  I am not a Jack Nicholson fan, but he really shines here.  He has you quite despising him at first, and by the last half hour, you're rooting for him to succeed in redeeming himself.This is considered a comedy, but there is a very serious undertone to it which is quite well brought out by the acting of the three principle characters (and the dog!).I hope you don't let any dislike of Jack Nicholson keep you from seeing this.

First time through the superb black comedy of this story of Melvin Udall - ""a truly awful human being"" - dominates your reactions. His incredible rudeness to everyone around him is unexpected, shocking and very, very funny and the tension & laughs it generates grab your immediate and undivided attention but mean you miss a lot on the way.Second time through the sheer excellence of the acting really hits home. Nicholson's interpretation of Udall's incredibly complex character is superb while Helen Hunt's portrayal of a desperately lonely waitress who's inextricably drawn to him and Greg Kinnear's portrayal of a gay artist struggling to come to terms with his sexuality and Udall's incessant verbal abuse are believable and beautifully touching. And then there's the gay artist's dog... putting in an Oscar level tour de force in the ""Best Supporting Canine"" section, plus excellent cameo performances from just about everyone else involved. Still very funny but, devoid of the shock of it all, you've got time to fully appreciate the quality of what's on offer and how the characters combine to produce a genuinely moving, multi-layered story about people's need for love and affection.And then... well there's more to come because as you go back and explore it once again you'll still be laughing - which is some feat for any comedy film - but you may also start to realise that things are not quite as straightforward as you thought. Udall gets the girl he wants but at no time during their relationship does he do anything that isn't based on total self-interest - in fact the only genuine tenderness he shows is towards the dog and, in the end, to the gay artist, leaving you wondering whether in addition to being a suppressed dog lover he may also be a suppressed gay, or indeed whether self interest isn't such a bad thing if it also gives other people what they want, or... maybe not? One thing's for certain: it's getting much deeper, more complex and more thought-provoking than it all seemed to be.

Melvin is bigoted, cranky, moody, and often times outright nasty.  His morning routine consists of things done in methodical order, immaculate routines.  One of these rituals includes his daily breakfast at the local diner, served by the one and only waitress who will tolerate him and his odd demands.Her name is Carol Connelly and she's a single mother to an asthmatic young son.  Hospital bills, as well as life's other expenses, have skyrocketed.  Carol is having difficulty making ends meet and struggles on a daily basis.  She temporarily leaves work to take care of her child.Therefore, Melvin can't eat his breakfast.Greg Kinnear plays Simon Bishop, Melvin's out-and-proud gay neighbor.  When he's brutally beaten and left for dead, his trusty little pup is left in Melvin's care, despite the fact that the two men despise each other.  Melvin's new babysitting job, along with Carol's absence from the diner, means that life is changing - and for the worst, he believes.  Melvin's ordered, hermetic world is falling apart due to these conflicts.These three entirely different people form a friendship and are soon able to see ""the sunny side"" of life, so to speak, due to the weaving and intersecting of their lives with each other's.AS GOOD AS IT GETS is an enlightening comedy that the majority of critics agreed with.  It is not a typical screwball comedy; it is instead a thought-provoking, earnest look at the lives of 3 people who at first seem to face normal hardships and tribulations.  But, as this film progresses, we find that the characters, played by each of the actors with such grace and such astounding skill, are anything but ordinary.  This fine film deserved every bit of praise it received from the critics and audiences alike.  I've watched it countless times and it never grows tedious or boring, even when I memorize the dialogue.AS GOOD AS IT GETS is one of those scarce treasures that finds the perfect and ideally comfortable balance between seriousness and humor.

10851,A16QODENBJVUI1,0767811100,Robert Moore,"[1, 2]","This is essentially a good movie that is graced by an absolutely stellar performance by one of America's great film actors.  Jack Nicholson has had several performances as memorable as this one, but he has never had one that was appreciably better.  As the child of an intensely obsessive-compulsive father, his performance especially hit home with me (as I was watching this movie with my daughter, I asked her, ""Does Jack Nicholson remind you of anyone?"" and she immediately shouted, ""Grandpa!--out of the mouth of babes).The brilliant thing about this movie is that it doesn't just stop with a character with a serious social-psychological problem, but deals with his attempts to break out of his mental prison to engage in normal relationships.  Partly this is done through his unexpected relationship with a neighbor's small dog.  Partly this is achieved by what is initially a selfish concern with the difficulties of a waitress with a son with serious health problems (selfish because her absence from the restaurant to deal with her son's health problems upsets his dining routine; he would rather pay out money to help her son than have her miss taking his order for his meal).  Gradually, however, he develops a concern for the waitress (Helen Hunt) not merely as the woman who takes his orders, but as a human being.  Eventually, in his own highly limited way, he sorta, kinda falls in love, to a degree that he is able to utter one of the most romantic lines I have heard in a film:  ""You make me wish I was a better man.""  He isn't a better man; he isn't even an especially desirable match.  But she is able to accept his affection, with all his limitations as a person.  It isn't the Disney version, but it is all rather lovely.The cast is by and large excellent.  Both Nicholson and Helen Hunt won Oscars for their performances.  I didn't care for Cuba Gooding Jr.'s rather campy gay character, though I suspect the problem was more in the way his part was written than in his performance.  I thought Greg Kinnear was OK as a gay artist and neighbor to Nicholson (in addition to being the owner of the dog), but like Gooding, I could never really accept him as being gay.

10852,A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,0767811100,Rocco Dormarunno,"[2, 3]","During times when it seems like you can't make a comedy without exploiting the handicapped or having bodily fluids fly around (like the Farrelly Brothers movies) or when having intercourse with American Pies is considered witty, and when everything else is a re-hash of the juvenile ""Porky's"" films of the '80s, ""As Good as it Gets"" stands out as one better comedies of the last 20 years. It is a genuine attempt to derive humor out of genuine human emotions and situations, and it succeeds most of the time.There are dozens of other reviews here that will tell you the plot, so I won't go over it again. What's worth going over is the job the actors have done. Nicholson, who has basically been playing parodies of himself since ""The Shining"", actually reveals a human side to his maniacal persona. Helen Hunt is endearing, outraged and hilarious, all at the same time. My favorite moment is when she curses out her HMO. Greg Kinnear's eyes are so full of tears most of the time, that you are urged to throw Kleenex at the screen, yet this makes his more humorous moments all the more funny. But it's Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s moments that make you laugh out loud, especially when he interacts with Nicholson. James Brooks' direction is near flawless.My only reason for holding back the fifth star is that the film really doesn't hold up to repeated viewings. You watch it once or twice, and then you have to put it away for a while. The happy ending is a little too neat, but I guess that should be okay. But my chief complaint is that the DVD version really doesn't offer much more than a few interviews with Brooks and the cast that are mildly amusing, but nothing more than what you would see on E! or Entertainment Tonight.Still, the title of ""As Good as it Gets"" is very modest.

10864,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,0767811100,Stephen A. Haines,"[4, 6]","If this isn't the best film ever made, it's at least among the top ten.  However, classifying this a &quot;romantic comedy&quot; applies a grievous misnomer to a film of great import.  Only superficially humorous, this film is rather a tragedy in the finest Sophoclean tradition.  The &quot;professional&quot; critics, uneasy with the power of the story and Nicholson's performance, have mis-categorized this film in almost every way.  It's a story of hubris, an inflated ego and intelligence, challenged by an envious world concerned only with its daily survival.The story concerns a professional writer [Nicholson] living alone in a New York apartment.  His gay neighbour dotes on one of those yappy, scruffy dogs &quot;cliff-house&quot; dwellers seem to favour.  Melvin Udall, the writer, suffers almost countless compulsive disorders, exacerbated by his urban life.  He avoids cracks in the sidewalk, is obsessive about cleanliness and, cloistered by his work, incapable of everyday discourse with other people.  Opening with him disposing of the dog, Nicholson sets the tone of the film in its first moments.  What seems cruel and inhuman is simply the expression of a man easily perturbed by minor irritations.  Which is crueler, disposing of the dog, or keeping one in urban confinement?Although the dog, Verdell, is rescued [to go on to stunning visuals later in the film], Udall is confronted by his neighbour and blurts his aversion to Simon's homosexuality.  As a writer who's set himself apart from the world surrounding him, it's not an unexpected attitude.  His vehemence is an almost predictable reaction.  Offending people, even when he doesn't intend it, keeps that world at bay and protects his own ego.  This isn't a particularly unusual condition among creative people, who are usually viewed by suspicious envy by the rest of the world.  The models for Melvin Udall are legion.  Patrick White and Xavier Herbert of Australia, George Bernard Shaw in the UK, J.D. Salinger in the US are but examples.  Aloof, detached from society, they rarely expressed what are commonly termed &quot;human emotions&quot; to their contemporaries.  Udall is following an all too-common pattern.What is different, but not unique, is Udall's being forced to come to grips with the aptness of his viewpoints.  That this realization comes through waitress Helen Hunt is what gives this film an additional fillip of humanity.  Hunt [Carol] chastises him, disciplines him, harries him, but in the last analysis, talks to him - as an equal.  She refuses to submit to his overbearing demeanor which gains his grudging respect.  Learning of her son Spencer's asthmatic condition, he provides help with the only resource he can give - money.  He doesn't do it for altruistic reasons - he's being selfish, wanting her to return to wait on him at the restaurant.  But the act opens his world which he tentatively, grudgingly begins to explore.  The exploration is fraught with feints, mis-steps and errors, but he continues the effort.  He's reluctant; it's a massive challenge for someone who's held himself intact alone for so long.Classifying this film as a comedy is due mainly to Nicholson's ability to deliver stinging one-liners a viper would envy.  No-one else in Hollywood could have entered this part with a finer track record in delivering the scathing character assassination, the piercing insult, the scornful rebuke.  One can envision other &quot;romantic comedy&quot; couples [to remain unnamed] who might have been cast in these parts.  The image is hollow and flat.  Nicholson is unmatched at biting wit delivered with facial expressions that a Falstaff couldn't convey.It is, of course, Helen Hunt who emerges as the wonderful surprise as an unexpected talent as the single mother struggling for survival.  Caught for years in a stultifying TV sitcom, Hunt became visible to movie audiences through some simplistic roles - until this one.  From this film, one can hear the grinding teeth of envious peers who will be hard pressed to match this performance.  Suffused with grace even in adversity, she achieves complete mastery of what was needed for the role.  One scene alone will reside in your memory.  The pressure overwhelms her and she breaks down in a storm tears.  &quot;Women's tears&quot; have long been a mainstay of Hollywood gender allotment.  Hunt, however, fights the breakdown every step of the way, her conflicting emotions flashing across her face as the camera moves to close-up.  Could you do it?  Can any other actress match it?  Possibly, but not likely.  Her Academy Award was richly deserved.  She's not been given a proper occasion to display these talents since AGAIG, but we can only hope another opportunity will arise soon.Those who've criticised this film on these pages and elsewhere should sit down in front of their screens quietly and undisturbed and look again.  If you're prejudiced by the label &quot;romantic comedy&quot; [which is understandable given how many such films are issued by Hollywood], strip the label from your mind and view this film again.  You may join me in saying it will be a long time before the quality of this film is matched.",5,An epic tragedy,1011571200,"01 21, 2002",2002,5195,"[""n't"", 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'least',

BrooksStarring Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg KinnearAs Good as It Gets blends drama, comedy and romance so well that it's hard to decide which category the movie falls into. Nominated for seven Oscars, Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt took home the leading actor honors. It was a competitive year with Titanic, L.A. Confidential and Good Will Hunting also in the running.It's hard to choose pinpoint Nicholson's top performance with so many candidates to choose from, but this has to rank among his best and he thoroughly deserved his third Oscar win. Nicholson plays author Melvin Udall. He lives alone and seems to hate most of the world around him. One of his least favorite people is his homosexual neighbor, Simon (Kinnear). In contrast, one of his favorite people is Carol (Hunt). From Melvin's point of view she's the only competent waitress at his local diner.As the story unfolds, we learn more about these three people. Melvin has OCD and we see him avoiding cracks in the pavement. He's severely messed up in a number of other ways too. Carol puts on a brave face at work, but she has to deal with her sick son on a daily basis and it's a heavy burden. Simon is an artist and seems to be intimidated by Melvin's attitude toward him.Nicholson is such a good actor and has incredible range. Think back to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for an example of how he can inject comedy into serious drama. I think his ability to make people laugh is often overlooked. As Melvin, he highlights that ability. Melvin isn't a very nice human being, but Nicholson actually makes us root for him. Carol is a positive influence and is the main reason he tries to change. Melvin does care about people, but it's buried beneath the surface.Nicholson makes us believe that a 60-year-old man with psychological problems is capable of attracting a woman in her early 30s. Kinnear plays Simon just about perfectly and was nominated for the performance. He also shows plenty of comedic ability and times everything well. The interplay between the three characters is fascinating and comes to a head when they take a trip together.The film contains some of the best dialogue I have heard. Some scenes will bring you close to tears while others will make you laugh. It's a shame that Nicholson and Hunt weren't given more opportunities to make films such as this.",5,You make me want to be a better man,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,2434,"['As', 'Good', '1997', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', '139', 'minutesDirected', 'James', 'L.', 'BrooksStarring', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Greg', 'KinnearAs', 'Good', 'drama', 'comedy', 'romance', 'so', 'well', 'hard', 'decide', 'category', 'movie', 'Nominated', 'seven', 'Oscars', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'took', 'home', 'leading', 'actor', 'honors', 'was', 'competitive', 'year', 'Titanic', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'also', 'running.It', 'hard', 'choose', 'pinpoint', 'Nicholson', 'top', 'performance', 'so', 'many', 'candidates', 'choose', 'rank', 'best', 'thoroughly', 'deserved', 'third', 'Oscar', 'win', 'Nicholson', 'author', 'Melvin', 'Udall', 'alone', 'hate', 'most', 'world', 'One', 'least', 'favorite', 'people', 'homosexual', 'neighbor', 'Simon', 'Kinnear', 'contrast', 'one', 'favorite', 'people', 'Carol', 'Hunt', 'Melvin', 'point', 'view', 'only', 'competent', 'waitress', 'local', 'diner.As', 'story', 'unfolds', 'learn', 'more', 'three', 'people', 'Melvin', 'OCD', 'see', 'avoiding', 'cracks', 'pavement', 'severely', 'messed', 'up', 'number', 'other', 'ways', 'too', 'Carol', 'brave', 'face', 'work', 'deal', 'sick', 'son', 'daily', 'basis', 'heavy', 'burden', 'Simon', 'artist', 'be', 'intimidated', 'Melvin', 'attitude', 'him.Nicholson', 'such', 'good', 'actor', 'incredible', 'range', 'Think', 'back', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'example', 'how', 'can', 'inject', 'comedy', 'serious', 'drama', 'think', 'ability', 'make', 'people', 'laugh', 'often', 'overlooked', 'Melvin', 'ability', 'Melvin', ""n't"", 'very', 'nice', 'human', 'being', 'Nicholson', 'actually', 'root', 'Carol', 'positive', 'influence', 'main', 'reason', 'change', 'Melvin', 'care', 'people', 'buried', 'surface.Nicholson', 'believe', '60-year-old', 'man', 'psychological', 'problems', 'capable', 'attracting', 'woman', 'early', '30s', 'Kinnear', 'Simon', 'just', 'about', 'perfectly', 'was', 'nominated', 'performance', 'also', 'plenty', 'comedic', 'ability', 'times', 'everything', 'well', 'interplay', 'three', 'characters', 'fascinating', 'head', 'when', 'take', 'trip', 'together.The', 'film', 'best', 'dialogue', 'have', 'heard', 'scenes', 'will', 'bring', 'close', 'tears', 'others', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'shame', 'Nicholson', 'Hunt', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'more', 'opportunities', 'make', 'films', 'such']",N/A

This is the kind of film that can be watched multiple times and one still finds things to enjoy in it.  The Amazon review and synopsis really cover the basics of this film, but the heart of this film belongs to one line said by Nicholson, ""You make me want to be a better man.""We are all victims of our circumstances and idiosyncracies at times, but we need to strive to get past them.  This is typified in Nicholson's line quoted above to Helen Hunt's character and in his later lines when he barges into his psychologist's office unannounced and where he complains about such conduct until Jack cuts him off with, ""You can't treat me for obssessive complusive disorders and then complain about when I committ such actions like I have a choice in the matter.""  Hysterical and all too true.This is a truly moving film with real life like characters that we grow to appreciate if not love.  I just love pulling this film down off my shelf to watch every so often.  My wife and I love it every time we watch it.  It's the kind of film that never gets old.  Nicholson is reliable and believable as always, and Helen Hunt is so much better than she's often given credit for being.  She is smart, beautiful, relatable, and enormously talented.

That protagonist is Melvin, played with relish by Jack Nicholson. Melvin is a highly successful novelist who is also an abrasive misanthrope suffering from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Not your typical hero for sure!)As one would expect, Melvin is a recluse and resistant to any changes in his life until he is forced to interact with a down-on-his-luck gay neighbor, Simon, portrayed by Greg Kinnear, and Simon's perky little pet pooch, Verdell. Melvin also becomes reluctantly involved with the pretty and patient waitress Carol, played by Helen Hunt, who serves him breakfast every day at a local cafe. Other than Carol, none of the other cafe's employees will deal with the impossible Melvin.When Carol abruptly quits her job, Melvin tracks her down and offers her financial incentives to return to her post. Melvin increasingly finds himself drawn into Carol's personal life, and he eventually falls for the plucky single mom.&quot;As Good As It Gets&quot; is a quirky update of the fable &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. Gifted writer-director James L. Brooks has assembled a superb cast to re-tell this classic tale. Besides the pitch perfect lead performances by Nicholson, Hunt, and Kinnear, there are sparkling supporting performances by Cuba Gooding Jr., Shirley Knight and others.Too many of today's so-called comedies are mindless, uninspired concoctions profuse with sophomoric vulgarities and sexual obscenities. &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot; reminds us that there are still a few determined filmmakers willing to bring qualities such as intelligence, inventiveness, sophistication, and charm back to the silver screen.

BrooksCast:  Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, Cuba Gooding Jr., Skeet Ulrich, Shirley Knight, Yeardling Smith.Running Time:  139 minutesRated PG-13 on appeal for strong language, thematic elements, nudity and a beating.""As Good As It Gets"" is a superb portrayal of a man, Melvin Udall (played marvelously by Jack Nicholson) with a debilitating condition that restricts his daily life and interactions. From the beginning of the movie we can tell that Melvin is somewhat off; he uses a brand new bar of soap every time he washes his hands, he won't step on cracks when walking down the street, he brings his own silverware to restaurants and he is obsessed with cleanliness. Also, Melvin lacks any control over social grace and tact, such as being very self-entered and blurting out rude comments that most people would refrain from. He compulsively engages in these activities. He is bound to his daily routine, which include going to a certain restaurant, being waited on by a certain waitress Carol (played by Helen Hunt), and ordering the same meal. The movie starts to take shape when his routine is disrupted when ""his"" waitress does not show up for work one day.  He becomes very rude to the new waitress and rudely tells her to get Carol so he can eat his food and go along with his routine. Melvin attempts to contact Carol at her home and even pays for her sick son's medical treatment just so she can get back to work and Melvin can get his routine back, all the way dog-sitting for his incredibly inconvenient gay artist neighbor (Greg Kinnear in a superb supporting role).As Good As It Gets"" boasts a splendid, delightful combination of wonderful, zesty acting and a remarkably bright and effective screenplay. Jack Nicholson is pitch-perfect as the obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon Melvin Udall, who possesses some of the strangest and most curious tendencies ever concocted by screenwriters; his Udall is so human, so heartfelt, so genuine, and so whimsical and Nicholson perfects him to such a degree that not a moment of his screen time is unwanted or uninteresting: in my valid opinion, this is Nicholson's best performance of his career, and one of the most reverent performances in film history. What an engaging, enthralling story: an troubled, insecure man helps a troubled, insecure waitress (troubled and insecure in different respects), and the two form an unlikely relationship from being distant acquaintances (Hunt even exclaims that Nicholson is crazy in their most uncomfortable moment in the film) to practical soul mates (Nicholson to Hunt: ""I feel that I'm the only person that knows that you are the greatest woman alive""), through a series of misfortunes, self-explorations, and mutual bondings.  Kinnear's character Simon has the distinct purpose in being both the bridge and the divider of Nicholson and Hunt's relationship, and he identifies with his character with compassion and understanding, as he has frequently been wronged throughout his existence. The most curious aspect to a story such as this, involving such unduly, diverse characters: a miserable recluse, a zesty, yet insecure waitress, and a sensitive and insightful, yet wronged homosexual, is that in their distinct differences, they share many of the same problems, and these problems eventually bring them all together, although hardly in a civilized manner.  Director James L. Brooks splendidly created this delightful masterpiece of exemplary romantic comedy, in its indelible acting (Oscars well deserved), its whimsical, touching screenplay (which arguably surpasses ""Good Will Hunting"" quality) and its comforting morale, that despite all of the great odds in life which prevent us from being happy, we can perhaps find it within ourselves to take that one important step in reversing our fortunes, in ""stopping with taking pills"" and to allow our lives, and our desires to shine and be realized, as this story depicts life. The best romantic comedy, certainly one of the best films of 1997, ""As Good As It Gets"" succeeds in practically every entertaining and endearing cinematic respect.",5,As Good As It Gets  (1997),1142035200,"03 11, 2006",2006,4127,"['Director', 'James', 'L.', 'BrooksCast', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'Yeardling', 'Smith.Running', 'Time', '139', 'minutesRated', 'PG-13', 'appeal', 'strong', 'language', 'thematic', 'elements', 'nudity', 'beating', 'As', 'Good', 'Gets', 'superb', 'portrayal', 'man', 'Melvin', 'Udall', 'played', 'marvelously', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'debilitating', 'condition', 'daily', 'life', 'interactions', 'beginning', 'movie', 'can', 'tell', 'Melvin', 'somewhat', 'off', 'brand', 'new', 'bar', 'soap', 'time', 'hands', 'wo', ""n't"", 'step', 'cracks', 'when', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'own', 'silverware', 'restaurants', 'obsessed', 'cleanliness', 'Also', 'Melvin', 'control', 'social', 'grace', 'tact', 'such', 'being', 'very', 'self-entered', 'blurting', 'out', 'rude', 'comments', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'refrain', 'compulsively', 'activities', 'bound', 'daily', 'routine', 'include', 'going', 'certain', 'restaurant', 'being', 'waited', 'certain', 'waitress', 'Carol', 'played', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'ordering', 'same', 'meal', 'movie', 'take', 'shape', 'when', 'routine', 'disrupted', 'when', 'waitress', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'work', 'one', 'day', 'very', 'rude', 'new', 'waitress', 'rudely', 'get', 'Carol', 'can', 'eat', 'food', 'go', 'along', 'routine', 'Melvin', 'contact', 'Carol', 'home', 'even', 'pays', 'sick', 'son', 'medical', 'treatment', 'just', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'work', 'Melvin', 'can', 'get', 'routine', 'back', 'way', 'dog-sitting', 'incredibly', 'inconvenient', 'gay', 'artist', 'neighbor', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'superb', 'supporting', 'role', '.As', 'Good', 'splendid', 'delightful', 'combination', 'wonderful', 'zesty', 'acting', 'remarkably', 'bright', 'effective', 'screenplay', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'pitch-perfect', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'curmudgeon', 'Melvin', 'Udall', 'who', 'strangest', 'most', 'curious', 'tendencies', 'ever', 'concocted', 'screenwriters', 'Udall', 'so', 'human', 'so', 'heartfelt', 'so', 'genuine', 'so', 'whimsical', 'Nicholson', 'degree', 'not', 'moment', 'screen', 'time', 'unwanted', 'uninteresting', 'valid', 'opinion', 'Nicholson', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'one', 'most', 'reverent', 'performances', 'film', 'history', 'What', 'engaging', 'enthralling', 'story', 'troubled', 'insecure', 'man', 'troubled', 'insecure', 'waitress', 'troubled', 'insecure', 'different', 'respects', 'two', 'form', 'unlikely', 'relationship', 'being', 'distant', 'acquaintances', 'Hunt', 'even', 'Nicholson', 'crazy', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'moment', 'film', 'practical', 'soul', 'mates', 'Nicholson', 'Hunt', 'feel', ""'m"", 'only', 'person', 'are', 'greatest', 'woman', 'alive', 'series', 'misfortunes', 'self-explorations', 'mutual', 'bondings', 'Kinnear', 'character', 'Simon', 'distinct', 'purpose', 'being', 'bridge', 'divider', 'Nicholson', 'Hunt', 'relationship', 'character', 'compassion', 'understanding', 'frequently', 'been', 'wronged', 'existence', 'most', 'curious', 'aspect', 'story', 'such', 'involving', 'such', 'unduly', 'diverse', 'characters', 'miserable', 'recluse', 'zesty', 'yet', 'insecure', 'waitress', 'sensitive', 'insightful', 'yet', 'wronged', 'homosexual', 'distinct', 'differences', 'share', 'many', 'same', 'problems', 'problems', 'eventually', 'bring', 'together', 'hardly', 'civilized', 'manner', 'Director', 'James', 'L.', 'Brooks', 'splendidly', 'created', 'delightful', 'masterpiece', 'exemplary', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'indelible', 'acting', 'Oscars', 'well', 'deserved', 'whimsical', 'touching', 'screenplay', 'arguably', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'quality', 'comforting', 'morale', 'great', 'odds', 'life', 'prevent', 'being', 'happy', 'can', 'perhaps', 'find', 'take', 'one', 'important', 'step', 'reversing', 'fortunes', 'stopping', 'taking', 'pills', 'allow', 'lives', 'desires', 'shine', 'be', 'realized', 'story', 'life', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'films', '1997', 'As', 'Good', 'practically', 'entertaining', 'endearing', 'cinematic', 'respect']",N/A

Often very offensive things, but he just can't help himself. Well, no disresepct to Nicholson, he is perfect for the part. He looks mad, yet intelligent, he's elequent, yet abuusive. The Oscar he won was deserving. Anyway, he meets this waitress (Helen Hunt) in his favourite restaurant (again, has his own table which only he can sit at, brings his own plastic cutlery). Hunt's son is sick and in desperate need of medical attention, something he can't get without money (Mmmm...sounds familiar). You sense a connection between Nicholson and Hunt. She later comments 'when I first saw you I thought you were hansome, then you opened your mouth' Greg Kinnear plays Nicholson's gay neighbour, and you can imagine some of the names he has to call him. Kinnear puts in a fine performance, in my opinion worthy of an Oscar.As the film progresses, the bond between Hunt and Nicholson seems to get stronger. Both are fragile people, and in the end find strength in each other. Despite Nicholson's mouth.This is a truly remarkable film.

In fact, each time I watched it, I found something new that I missed, that made the story even better.We have a rude, obsessive, compulsive romance writer (of all things) portrayed by Jack Nicholson.  A single mother raising a son who is a chronical ashmatic portrayed by Helen Hunt and a gay artist for a neighbor who owns a small dog whose care gets foisted  on Jack.It is so hilarious and yet portrays the sad and emotional conflicts that people face when they are different from others and desire acceptance of those differences among those around them.  It is not easy being different in this world.Even though Jack doesn't want anyone to know how attached he has gotten to the little dog that was foisted on him, the love and care he gives the dog is endearing.  The dog clearly loves him back and even imitates Jack's act of not stepping on the cracks in the sidewalk.Helen is a compassionate waitress who has become a necessity to Jack's feeling of well-being.  He has to have her be his waitress, much to the relief of the other waitresses.  She is the only one who can put up with his behavior and when she isn't at work because of her son's asthma he gets a specialist to treat him just so she can wait on him.The interaction between the cast of characters and the budding romance between Jack and Helen make this an endearing movie that will remain in our thoughts and hearts for years to come.

On the contrary, this is a film where the central character, an obsessive-compulsive bigot, is human from the start: We just don't realize it. A key moment in the film is when Simon, Melvin's gay neighbour (Greg Kinnear), is telling the young male prostitute, Vincent (Skeet Ulrich), about his art, and comments that he likes to watch people because sometimes, when you look at someone long enough, ""you see their humanity."" At that point Vincent is momentarily enabled to see something beyond the seedy world of male prostitution; at the same time Simon gives us the interpretive key to the whole movie. It is a film about three very different people who discover their common humanity.Melvin is a hateful and insensitive recluse with a debilitating mental disorder; Carol (Helen Hunt), a Manhattan waitress struggling with her son's chronic illness and finding her identity swallowed up in the process; Simon, a gay artist who loses everything when he is attacked and robbed in his own home. One by one they must learn to see the humanity in each other and, as importantly, in themselves (""Where'd I go?"" asks Simon as he looks at the reflection of his battered face in the mirror). We, too, must learn to see the human being underneath the spiteful and vicious (if somewhat the ""loveable rogue"") in Melvin.The theme is developed sensitively and beautifully throughout the course of the film (perhaps only slightly overlong at more than two hours), with help coming from a fourth character, Verdelle, a dog, whose pivotal role in the narrative is easily overlooked (standing in the same cinematic tradition as Toto of ""The Wizard of Oz""). By the end of the film, we are aware that the big issues in the character's lives are still to be totally overcome, but the process of resolution has begun as it should, with the characters each recognizing the dignity and worth of the others (and themselves).James L. Brook's delicate direction carefully avoids excessive sentimentalism and saccharine sweetness (though admittedly, it teeters perilously close to the edge at times), and results in one of the most charming and profound comedies of recent years.",5,One of the '90s most beautiful comedies,1038355200,"11 27, 2002",2002,2280,"['reviewer', 'comments', 'events', 'film', 'conspire', 'make', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'rather', 'Melvyn', 'Udall', 'human', 'being', 'contrary', 'film', 'where', 'central', 'character', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'bigot', 'human', 'start', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'key', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'Simon', 'Melvin', 'gay', 'neighbour', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'telling', 'young', 'male', 'prostitute', 'Vincent', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'art', 'comments', 'watch', 'people', 'sometimes', 'when', 'look', 'someone', 'long', 'enough', 'see', 'humanity', 'point', 'Vincent', 'momentarily', 'enabled', 'see', 'something', 'seedy', 'world', 'male', 'prostitution', 'same', 'time', 'Simon', 'interpretive', 'key', 'whole', 'movie', 'film', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'who', 'discover', 'common', 'humanity.Melvin', 'hateful', 'insensitive', 'recluse', 'debilitating', 'mental', 'disorder', 'Carol', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Manhattan', 'waitress', 'struggling', 'son', 'chronic', 'illness', 'finding', 'identity', 'swallowed', 'up', 'process', 'Simon', 'gay', 'artist', 'who', 'everything', 'when', 'attacked', 'robbed', 'own', 'home', 'One', 'one', 'must', 'learn', 'see', 'humanity', 'other', 'importantly', 'Where', ""'d"", 'go', 'Simon', 'reflection', 'battered', 'face', 'mirror', 'too', 'must', 'learn', 'see', 'human', 'being', 'spiteful', 'vicious', 'somewhat', 'loveable', 'rogue', 'Melvin.The', 'theme', 'developed', 'sensitively', 'beautifully', 'course', 'film', 'perhaps', 'only', 'slightly', 'overlong', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'help', 'coming', 'fourth', 'character', 'Verdelle', 'dog', 'pivotal', 'role', 'narrative', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'standing', 'same', 'cinematic', 'tradition', 'Toto', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'aware', 'big', 'issues', 'character', 'lives', 'are', 'still', 'be', 'totally', 'overcome', 'process', 'resolution', 'begun', 'should', 'characters', 'recognizing', 'dignity', 'worth', 'others', 'L.', 'Brook', 'delicate', 'direction', 'carefully', 'avoids', 'excessive', 'sentimentalism', 'saccharine', 'sweetness', 'admittedly', 'perilously', 'close', 'edge', 'times', 'results', 'one', 'most', 'charming', 'profound', 'comedies', 'recent', 'years']",N/A

After this  one, Jack Nicholson can safely retire, because his role in  &quot;AGAIG&quot; is...well...as good as it gets...I don't think that an  actor of his age and his caliber would get another chance like this one.
