1304157,A2CKO47KWC90A0,B002ZG97YM,"10-yr-old Movie Critic ""Perry's Previews""","[3, 4]","The Following review was published on Rancho Santa Fe Review, Carmel Valley News, We Chinese in America, and:featured on NPR (National Public Radio):[...]Animation World Network (my press junket photo, Dragon drawing):[...]Perry's Previews:[...]----------------How could a wimpy kid who is so different form everyone else defy others' expectation and become a true hero and leader?In the new DreamWorks animation action-adventure thriller ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" Hiccup, an eccentric adolescent with a weak build but a strong sense of humor, lives on the Island of Berk, a bustling place full of imposing, muscular Vikings, led by ""Stoick the Vast,"" the Viking Chief and the father of Hiccup, who could not hide his disappointment for his only son.In Berk, fighting swarms of nightmarish dragons is a way of life for centuries.  Gobber, the comical blacksmith and dragon fighting coach, is one of Hiccup's few true friends.  Gobber lost his arm and leg from earlier dragon fighting.  He has a unique ""no-nonsense"" style of training, making his apprentices ""throw themselves at the dragons.""  He figures that the ones who survive will surly survive on the battlefield.Another genuine friend of Hiccup's turns out to be one of a different kind: a ""Night Fury"" dragon, the most intelligent and mysterious kind that nobody else had ever seen before.  One dark night, Hiccup captured an unseen creature with his own flying net.  The next day, he saw the Night Fury dragon: pitch black, fierce, but also injured and helpless.  Seeing the fear in its eyes, Hiccup set it free, a crime against the Viking's code of conduct!  Hiccup repaired the injured dragon's tail which he had shot off, and gave him his favorite food: fish.  In return, the dragon (whom Hiccup named ""Toothless"") took him on many thrilling flights and revealed to him the deepest secrets of dragons.The secrets of dragons gave Hiccup a surprising edge in his dragon training, which shocked the formerly most promising Viking teen, Astrid, a new character absent from the original book.  Astrid, a hardworking and super-competitive girl, gradually warmed up to Hiccup as he shared his hidden world.The problem is that Viking's sworn enemies are dragons, and with that risk, Hiccup cannot keep Toothless a secret forever...In the end, Hiccup became an unexpected hero, using his hidden power, ultimately redeeming himself and changing the lives of every Viking villagers, forever.My favorite part of the film is how Hiccup tamed Toothless.  The scene when Hiccup reached out his hand for Toothless to touch for the first time, is the most magical scene in the film.  My favorite character is obviously Hiccup, who seemed wimpy and different at first, but is the one with true power inside.  Hiccup and I also share a passion for dragon and drawing.  I was born in 2000, the year of the Dragon, and consider myself a ""Dragonologist,"" one of my favorite books that I own is ""How to raise and keep a dragon.""  I have drawn so many different kinds of dragons and made tin-foiled animal sculptures of dragon.More importantly, Hiccup and I share a gentleness, innocence, and kindness towards other living creatures which enabled us to tame wild animals: dragons for him and a deer for me.  I still remember vividly how a beautiful deer approached me and licked my hand and head at the San Diego Wild Animal Park when I was three years old and just moved to San Diego from San Francisco.  I noticed that the deer did not lick any other kids even when they petted her.  It is easier to tame an animal when it has no fear for you.""How to Train Your Dragons"" is an epic tale packed with adventure, action, humor, stunning 3D visuals and beautiful music.  I give it 4.5 starfish, it is as good as Up!  It is a film that I think every child and parent will love to experience.  The movie is about friendship, connection, redemption, and the hidden power of ""being different.""This is the first time that I am invited to a film's press junket, held at the luxurious 5-star and 5-diamond rated Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills on March 20, 2010.  What an experience!  I gave it 5 starfish rating myself: I got to pick TWO favorite toys in the gift basket the moment my mom and I arrived, and another gift when we were checking out!  The fragrant air smelled like orchids and cinnamon, the food is amazing, and the service is even better.  Stacy, the nice waitress and I became instant friends.  I had a blast at the swimming pool with two boys from New York and London.The coolest part of the press junket was interviewing directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, voice talents Jay Baruchel (Hiccup), America Ferguson (Astrid), and Craig Ferguson (Gobber).When I shared my 4.5 starfish rating, the directors and actors were all curious about the missing half starfish.  I asked them: How could Hiccup survive flying on the back of Toothless at 50,000 feet in the air, without suffocating or freezing to death?  Directors Sanders and DeBlois laughed and joked that they would make sure to prepare oxygen tank and protective gear for Hiccup next time.America Ferguson laughed so hard when I said, ""I guess it's poetic license,"" and became my instant fan!  America thought Astrid added a lot to the story because ""she was the best and always challenged Hiccup to be the person he should be.""  Craig Ferguson, who played Gobber, challenged me to take flying lessons.  He said the best part of his role in the film was not having to dress up for work!Unlike ""Hideous Zippleback,"" the two-headed dragon in the film whose two heads fight all the time, directors Sanders and DeBlois have a warm friendship since their ""Mulan"" collaboration and share similar tastes in the kind of movies they like to make.  What happens when you disagree?  I asked.  ""Usually we make coupons for each other, so that if one of us wins this argument, the other can use the coupon to win the next one,"" said DeBlois.  Asked about the stunning designs of various dragons in the film, Sanders said, ""We worked with a terrific artist who designed over a thousand different dragons, some from the book, others from his own imagination.  Some of them are as good as yours!""  He was referring to my Chinese Imperial dragon I drew last year at Disney D23 expo.Jay Baruchel and I shared thoughts about being different as I asked him how he drew his own life experiences to play Hiccup.  ""I remember all the other kids outside playing soccer or hockey when I was growing up, but all I wanted to do was reading comic books, watching cartoons, or write stories.  I was different just like Hiccup, and I always think of myself as the one with true power inside,"" said Jay, ""You need to be proud of how different you are, because difference is what makes the world interesting.  The people who have everything come easy, who don't have to fight for anything, who are everyone's favorite all the time, they don't have anything interesting to say.""  I couldn't agree more!""How to Train Your Dragon"" is not only a thrilling action adventure, but also a tale with deep emotion and strong morale: Friends are more powerful than foes.  Being different empowers you to see what others cannot see.Liane Hansen, National Public Radio (NPR) host of Weekend Edition Sunday interviewed me about ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" on Sunday, March 28, 2010. NPR is the leading national radio program with over 30 million listeners worldwide.

The water scenes are so real visually it is hard to register in one's mind they aren't actually IN, UNDER OR ON water. The texture of the clothing, hair, skin on the people characters is amazing as is the skin and scales of the dragons. The story is essentially a father/son relationship tale with ""coming of age"" scenario of a young man trying to communicate his character and worth to a father who is locked in a mindset of his son being inept and more of a village liability than an asset.

1304167,A2R1R907SMOJHD,B002ZG97YM,Alastair G. Stell,"[1, 1]","This is an actual review of the product. I saw the film at the theatre, and bought the disk on the strength of the 3D cinema version. I should add that I've seen EVERY 3D movie as I'm actively involved in developing 3D solutions. A few comments on the film first.This is one of the best 3D films currently produced. Where others disappoint or add nothing to the viewer's experience, the 3D in this film is used to great effect. Flying sequences do bring out the best in 3D it seems! To-date the only 3D film to rival this one is Avatar (of course). In general animation lends itself to 3D because the creative opportunities are greater. Also, live action Directors seem to have a problem leveraging 3D at present. We need a new generation of Directors, better cameras and processing, and better screenplay before we see 3D achieve its true potential.But enough of that. At least 17% of the public can't see 3D so lets get to the 2D BluRay disk. First, the 2D disk seems noticeably longer than the 3D version I watched. I don't have figures on this, but the flying sequences seem longer. Maybe not, but subjectively it felt that way. In any case, I enjoyed the second viewing almost as much as the first. This is one of those rare disks that merits many plays. Of course humor and action lend themselves to repeat plays, but what distinguishes this film is the attention to detail and the endearing characters. I won't bother repeating the positive reviews which abound for this film. Just enough to say I adore the dragons, the people... everything about this film is good or great.The extra material is a bit of a let down. The deleted scenes are storyboards for the most part; I was hoping for some genuine animation. Trawling through the rest of the material, there is a BD-Live connection which was momentarily interesting. It is clear the studios need to work at understanding what the internet savvy user finds entertaining.

1304181,AW85VDASDM8VU,B002ZG97YM,Amazon Customer,"[0, 1]","A dragon will always, always go for the kill.This is the Isle of Berk, home of some Vikings.  They are led by Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler) a bulky dragon-killing warrior.  His son, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), hasn't inherited many (or any) of his old man's attributes.  He's weak, brainy, and a bit sensitive.  Instead, he works in the smithy with Gobber the Belch (Craig Ferguson).  During the opening battle/dragon raid, Hiccup pulls out one of his contraptions and pulls down the most mysterious dragon kind of known and nobody believes him.  When he comes face to face with the dragon, he can't bring himself to kill it and sets it free.  He then has to start up his dragon-killing training (with the regular kids, including hottie, Astrid (America Ferrera)).  Well, as he becomes better acquainted with Toothless, his pet dragon, he finds that his Viking brethren don't really understand the dragons.How to Train Your Dragon (2010) is a (rather loose) adaptation of the book of the same name (published in 2003).  I've not read it.  I imagine it's quite nice.  Apparently, the central story is completely different.  Just thought you'd like to know.It's a really good story.  It's not completely outside our experience as the would-be killer changes their views about the enemy once they actually meet one.  But that totally works in the hands of people who know when to play the right music, which these people seem to do.That's not quite fair to How to Train Your Dragon because the movie actually performs the task much better than most.  In a movie like Avatar (2009), the main character runs around with the ""enemy"" for a bit and then comes to love them.  In this movie, Hiccup's inquisitiveness and sensitivity is what brings him closer to the dragon(s) and that takes time.He slowly learns about Toothless (crap name, by the way) and applies those lessons one at a time.  He grows in confidence and becomes his own man.  It's very well done and it makes this movie well worth the time.Now I'll get into slagging it off.A little too preoccupied with giving us a RPG-style description of the dozens of dragons they've got.  If you don't know role-playing games, I'm guessing the ""level 5 shield"" was complete nonsense to you.  I liked some of the latter, but not so much of the former.  Am I supposed to remember all of these kinds of dragons?  Is that going to be important?  No?  Then chill.It cuts both ways, of course, because Hiccup's learning about the dragons helps him to deal non-lethally with the dragons.  We need to understand both the dragons and the Vikings' views of them to make sense of things.  So, there's a balance to be set here, but they probably could have done it more elegantly.  Much less at the very start, for one thing.I wasn't a huge fan of the animation style.  The humans look like Bratz while the dragons seem to be inspired by Puff.  Obviously, this is a kids movie primarily, so there's no reason to expect Beowulf (2007), and a good thing too, but they could have added some texture.  It keeps things playful.The playfulness, though, is also a bit of a problem.  They talk about killing dragons (thousands in fact), but we never see them do it.  Of course we don't, that would break up the BAM, SMASH comic fighting with too much reality.  And yet, when they've got to [Spoiler] the [Spoiler] [Spoiler], when it comes time to finish it, they've got to change gears on that theme.Another time, during dragon slayer training, Hiccup seems to come within an inch of being blasted to death.  But that fire gets completely absorbed by the shield and nobody gets hurt.  I'm saying there's some mixed messages there.  When should we get nervous?I'm not sure what a director does in these kinds of films, but Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders directed.  They also wrote along with William Davies.  For writing credits, it went both ways, as I mentioned, but I'm willing to allow a little over-zealous exposition when it's got well-paced development on the back end (at least as far as Hiccup is concerned).  Outside of Hiccup, characters are pretty functional, but that's to be expected.I'd put the voice acting at about par.  They weren't asked to get very deep, but they didn't seem to try very hard.One of the few animated films that doesn't rely on a relentless barrage of zingers, but relies entirely on its charming plot.  You've got to respect that.  Personally, I prefer a movie like Rango (2011) that gives you both, but I prefer How to Train Your Dragon to the one-liners-only movies that were the sequels to Shrek (2001).",4,Prof. Ratigan Reviews,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,4565,"['dragon', 'will', 'always', 'always', 'go', 'kill.This', 'Isle', 'Berk', 'home', 'Vikings', 'are', 'led', 'Stoick', 'Vast', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'bulky', 'dragon-killing', 'warrior', 'son', 'Hiccup', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', ""n't"", 'inherited', 'many', 'old', 'man', 'attributes', 'weak', 'brainy', 'bit', 'sensitive', 'Instead', 'smithy', 'Gobber', 'Belch', 'Craig', 'Ferguson', 'opening', 'battle/dragon', 'raid', 'Hiccup', 'out', 'one', 'contraptions', 'pulls', 'down', 'most', 'mysterious', 'dragon', 'kind', 'known', 'nobody', 'When', 'face', 'face', 'dragon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'kill', 'free', 'then', 'start', 'up', 'dragon-killing', 'training', 'regular', 'kids', 'including', 'hottie', 'Astrid', 'America', 'Ferrera', 'Well', 'better', 'acquainted', 'Toothless', 'pet', 'dragon', 'Viking', 'brethren', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'dragons.How', 'Train', 'Dragon', '2010', 'rather', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'published', '2003', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'imagine', 'quite', 'nice', 'Apparently', 'central', 'story', 'completely', 'different', 'Just', 'thought', ""'d"", 'like', 'know.It', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'not', 'completely', 'experience', 'would-be', 'killer', 'changes', 'views', 'enemy', 'actually', 'meet', 'one', 'totally', 'hands', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'when', 'play', 'right', 'music', 'people', 'seem', 'do.That', 'not', 'quite', 'fair', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'movie', 'actually', 'task', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'movie', 'Avatar', '2009', 'main', 'character', 'enemy', 'bit', 'then', 'love', 'movie', 'Hiccup', 'inquisitiveness', 'sensitivity', 'what', 'closer', 'dragon', 's', 'time.He', 'slowly', 'Toothless', 'crap', 'name', 'way', 'applies', 'lessons', 'one', 'time', 'confidence', 'own', 'man', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'well', 'time.Now', ""'ll"", 'get', 'slagging', 'off.A', 'little', 'too', 'preoccupied', 'giving', 'RPG-style', 'description', 'dozens', 'dragons', ""'ve"", 'got', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'role-playing', 'games', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'level', '5', 'shield', 'was', 'complete', 'nonsense', 'liked', 'latter', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'former', 'Am', 'supposed', 'remember', 'kinds', 'dragons', 'going', 'be', 'important', 'Then', 'chill.It', 'cuts', 'ways', 'course', 'Hiccup', 'learning', 'dragons', 'deal', 'non-lethally', 'dragons', 'need', 'understand', 'dragons', 'Vikings', 'views', 'make', 'sense', 'things', 'So', 'balance', 'be', 'set', 'here', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'elegantly', 'Much', 'less', 'very', 'start', 'one', 'thing.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'fan', 'animation', 'style', 'humans', 'look', 'Bratz', 'dragons', 'seem', 'be', 'inspired', 'Puff', 'Obviously', 'kids', 'movie', 'primarily', 'reason', 'expect', 'Beowulf', '2007', 'good', 'thing', 'too', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'texture', 'things', 'playful.The', 'playfulness', 'also', 'bit', 'problem', 'talk', 'killing', 'dragons', 'thousands', 'fact', 'never', 'see', 'do', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'would', 'break', 'up', 'BAM', 'SMASH', 'comic', 'fighting', 'too', 'much', 'reality', 'yet', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', '[', 'Spoiler', ']', '[', 'Spoiler', ']', '[', 'Spoiler', ']', 'when', 'time', 'finish', ""'ve"", 'got', 'change', 'gears', 'theme.Another', 'time', 'dragon', 'slayer', 'training', 'Hiccup', 'come', 'inch', 'being', 'blasted', 'death', 'fire', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'shield', 'nobody', 'hurt', ""'m"", 'saying', 'mixed', 'messages', 'there', 'When', 'should', 'get', 'nervous', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'director', 'kinds', 'films', 'Dean', 'DeBlois', 'Chris', 'Sanders', 'directed', 'also', 'wrote', 'William', 'Davies', 'writing', 'credits', 'went', 'ways', 'mentioned', ""'m"", 'willing', 'allow', 'little', 'over-zealous', 'exposition', 'when', 'got', 'well-paced', 'development', 'back', 'end', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'Hiccup', 'concerned', 'Hiccup', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'functional', 'be', 'expected.I', ""'d"", 'put', 'voice', 'acting', 'par', 'were', ""n't"", 'asked', 'get', 'very', 'deep', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'try', 'very', 'hard.One', 'few', 'animated', 'films', ""n't"", 'rely', 'relentless', 'barrage', 'zingers', 'entirely', 'charming', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'got', 'respect', 'Personally', 'prefer', 'movie', 'Rango', '2011', 'prefer', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'one-liners-only', 'movies', 'were', 'sequels', 'Shrek', '2001']",N/A

1304192,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG97YM,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`How to Train our Dragon' has such charming buoyancy about it, a delightful air of warmth that sucks you in and keeps you glued to every frame.  Taking the source material and using it as a mere foundation for a far more accessible story, `How to Train Your Dragon' is one of those rare films that gets the clich&eacute;s just right.  I'm certainly a skeptic when it comes to clich&eacute;s, but certain films underscore them in a way that makes them feel pertinent to the story, and that is the case here.  Instead of transferring the oddly uninspired prose developed in the children's book to the big screen, `How to Train Your Dragon' is something completely different and far more effective thanks to the sharp changes made to the story itself.The film follows an unlikely hero, Hiccup.  Hiccup is a Viking, son to the chief and yet he is, well, not very Viking-like.  He's small and scrawny and peaceable, as opposed to big and brawny and violent.  When all of Hiccup's fellow villagers are waging war against the dragons, slaying them left and right and training their hardest to defend their livelihoods, Hiccup is befriending them.  Soon it becomes apparent to Hiccup that the misconception surrounding these winged beasts needs to be addressed, and changed for the betterment of the Viking people and for the dragons themselves.  With his newfound friend, a rare and dangerous dragon he names Toothless, Hiccup attempts to change the minds of his people, but that is easier said than done.One thing of note regarding this film; it is visually arresting.  The CGI animation is superb, truly.  The character details are wonderful (Toothless himself being a wonder to the eyes) and the editing is as sharp as they come; splicing through scenes with marvelous effect.The story, one of acceptance and love and growth, is exemplified by the simplistic approach to the script.  Like I said, it is one of those films that takes advantage of the clich&eacute;s it possesses.  Having read the source material (and not caring for it much at all), it is nice to see the themes presented in a much farer fashion in this splendid film.  The humor is subtle, yet effective, never beating the audience over the head with manipulated gags and one-liners.  Instead, the film allows the softness of the story to transcend.The themes of loyalty and love are given a nice touch with each passing frame.With tons of excitement and charm to boot, with a story that will appease both kid and adults, `How to Train Your Dragon' is yet another notch in the animation belt of 2010 (god, what a great year for animated films).  Don't worry too much about the thrills here either, as the action is presented in a way that the humor can shine and the scares don't last.  You'll little ones won't be hiding under the blanket or complaining of nightmares here.This one is all fun and games!",5,This one soars!,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,2867,"['How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'such', 'charming', 'buoyancy', 'delightful', 'air', 'warmth', 'keeps', 'glued', 'frame', 'Taking', 'source', 'material', 'using', 'mere', 'foundation', 'far', 'more', 'accessible', 'story', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'clich', 'eacute', 'just', 'right', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'skeptic', 'when', 'clich', 'eacute', 'certain', 'films', 'underscore', 'way', 'feel', 'pertinent', 'story', 'case', 'here', 'Instead', 'transferring', 'oddly', 'uninspired', 'prose', 'developed', 'children', 'book', 'big', 'screen', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'thanks', 'sharp', 'changes', 'made', 'story', 'itself.The', 'film', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'Hiccup', 'Hiccup', 'Viking', 'son', 'chief', 'yet', 'well', 'not', 'very', 'Viking-like', 'small', 'scrawny', 'peaceable', 'opposed', 'big', 'brawny', 'violent', 'When', 'Hiccup', 'fellow', 'villagers', 'are', 'waging', 'war', 'dragons', 'slaying', 'left', 'right', 'training', 'hardest', 'defend', 'livelihoods', 'Hiccup', 'befriending', 'Soon', 'apparent', 'Hiccup', 'misconception', 'surrounding', 'winged', 'beasts', 'needs', 'be', 'addressed', 'changed', 'betterment', 'Viking', 'people', 'dragons', 'newfound', 'friend', 'rare', 'dangerous', 'dragon', 'Toothless', 'Hiccup', 'change', 'minds', 'people', 'easier', 'said', 'done.One', 'thing', 'note', 'regarding', 'film', 'visually', 'arresting', 'CGI', 'animation', 'superb', 'truly', 'character', 'details', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Toothless', 'being', 'wonder', 'eyes', 'editing', 'as', 'sharp', 'come', 'splicing', 'scenes', 'marvelous', 'effect.The', 'story', 'one', 'acceptance', 'love', 'growth', 'exemplified', 'simplistic', 'approach', 'script', 'said', 'one', 'films', 'advantage', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'Having', 'read', 'source', 'material', 'not', 'caring', 'much', 'nice', 'see', 'themes', 'presented', 'much', 'farer', 'fashion', 'splendid', 'film', 'humor', 'subtle', 'yet', 'effective', 'never', 'beating', 'audience', 'head', 'manipulated', 'gags', 'one-liners', 'Instead', 'film', 'softness', 'story', 'transcend.The', 'themes', 'loyalty', 'love', 'are', 'given', 'nice', 'touch', 'passing', 'frame.With', 'tons', 'excitement', 'charm', 'boot', 'story', 'will', 'appease', 'kid', 'adults', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'yet', 'notch', 'animation', 'belt', '2010', 'god', 'what', 'great', 'year', 'animated', 'films', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'too', 'much', 'thrills', 'here', 'either', 'action', 'presented', 'way', 'humor', 'can', 'shine', 'scares', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', ""'ll"", 'little', 'ones', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'hiding', 'blanket', 'complaining', 'nightmares', 'here.This', 'one', 'fun', 'games']",N/A
1304193,A13NM1PES9OXVN,B002ZG97YM,"Angela Mitchell ""Angela Mitchell""","[3, 3]","(Don't worry, no spoilers!) I was, first off, flabbergasted by this beautiful film. That looked, frankly, in the ads, like a forgettable animated throwaway. The dragons looked ugly. The clips emphasized the pop culture references of 'Madagascar' and 'Shrek' in ways that didn't look BAD, just shallow. I'd seen it before. So I stayed away.Boy, was I dumb. Meet one of the year's best films, animated or no. A beautiful and moving journey that addresses war and peace, man and animal, love and hate, and even disability and wholeness. The dragons are not ugly, but are more like birds and bats (with a dash of cat!)--squat and weird on the ground, yet gorgeous and graceful in flight. Toothless's flights make the flights in 'Avatar' look clumsy, honestly (and I'm not dissing 'Avatar,' I totally enjoyed it).The flying sequences are gorgeous, poignant, joyful and moving. These scenes are something special. When a character runs a hand through the air above them, blissfully, feeling the feathery cool, previously untouchable, clouds against their fingertips, it's almost impossible not to feel their joy.""How to Train Your Dragon"" is, in fact, an utter delight, a moving and witty and incredibly deep exploration of people and animals, no less, who dare to envision a different outcome for themselves. (Yeah. I cried.)The growing friendship between the misfit boy Hiccup and his dragon friend Toothless is eerie, quiet (nearly wordless) and gorgeously depicted--helped enormously by John Powell's lovely score. It will remind many, in fact, of the quietly humorous scenes in Carroll Ballard's classic ""The Black Stallion"" over three decades ago.I found myself so invested that I held my breath more than once. And did I cry at other scenes? Heck yeah. And filled with wonder, at some of the eeriest and most beautiful moments I've ever seen in an animated film.What I loved about the writing for HTTYD, along with so many other animated favorites of mine, as well, was that there was this obvious care taken with the script and story. Because every animated moment costs so much, every moment matters. Everything comes together in a satisfying and literate way. Watching it made me wish more live-action filmmakers took half as much care with the stories and scripts they create. (I love movies in general -- always have -- but honestly, the past 4-5 years, I'm lucky if I like even 2 or 3 a year anymore.)Two other things that really struck me in the film:1. The repeated refrain of ""I did this."" It's said several times throughout the film, in happiness, regret, disappointment, etc., and it's a really subtle way of empowering the characters. They take responsibility for what they do, for good or ill. I really like that.2. The fact that Toothless and Hiccup are a mutual support system -- friends whose challenges mirror each other's. That's all I'll say. But the last 5 minutes of the film I found incredibly unique for a kid's film. And really moving and poignant. There is a deep love between boy and dragon that will resonate for anyone who's ever had a much-loved pet. Sometimes that bond can seem like mind-reading. They simply know what you need, and provide it.All I'll say, remaining vague, is that I was in tears for the final 5 minutes of the film, and the emotions were too complex to name. There's regret, joy, love, and acceptance. That's enough for me.And best of all, [the ending of this film] really packs a wallop yet is utterly unpreachy. It's just the satisfying culmination of a really well-told story. And for a cute little animated movie that I kind of expected to forget almost as soon as I watched it, that totally knocks me out. There's a lot of depth to this story, and I found myself thinking about it even the next day. It's awesome when that happens.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",5,A delight that allows all ages to soar with the dragons...,1290384000,"11 22, 2010",2010,3824,"['Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'spoilers', 'was', 'first', 'flabbergasted', 'beautiful', 'film', 'looked', 'frankly', 'ads', 'forgettable', 'animated', 'throwaway', 'dragons', 'looked', 'ugly', 'clips', 'emphasized', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', ""'Madagascar"", ""'Shrek"", 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'BAD', 'just', 'shallow', ""'d"", 'seen', 'stayed', 'away.Boy', 'was', 'dumb', 'Meet', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'films', 'animated', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'journey', 'war', 'peace', 'man', 'animal', 'love', 'hate', 'even', 'disability', 'wholeness', 'dragons', 'are', 'not', 'ugly', 'are', 'more', 'birds', 'bats', 'dash', 'cat', 'squat', 'weird', 'ground', 'yet', 'gorgeous', 'graceful', 'flight', 'Toothless', 'flights', 'make', 'flights', ""'Avatar"", 'look', 'clumsy', 'honestly', ""'m"", 'not', 'dissing', 'totally', 'enjoyed', 'flying', 'sequences', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'poignant', 'joyful', 'moving', 'scenes', 'are', 'something', 'special', 'When', 'character', 'hand', 'air', 'blissfully', 'feeling', 'feathery', 'cool', 'previously', 'untouchable', 'clouds', 'fingertips', 'almost', 'impossible', 'not', 'feel', 'joy', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'fact', 'utter', 'delight', 'moving', 'witty', 'incredibly', 'deep', 'exploration', 'people', 'animals', 'less', 'who', 'dare', 'envision', 'different', 'outcome', 'Yeah', 'cried', 'growing', 'friendship', 'misfit', 'boy', 'Hiccup', 'dragon', 'friend', 'Toothless', 'eerie', 'quiet', 'nearly', 'wordless', 'gorgeously', 'depicted', 'helped', 'enormously', 'John', 'Powell', 'lovely', 'score', 'will', 'remind', 'many', 'fact', 'quietly', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'Carroll', 'Ballard', 'classic', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'three', 'decades', 'ago.I', 'found', 'so', 'invested', 'held', 'breath', 'more', 'once', 'did', 'cry', 'other', 'scenes', 'Heck', 'yeah', 'filled', 'wonder', 'eeriest', 'most', 'beautiful', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'animated', 'film.What', 'loved', 'writing', 'HTTYD', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'animated', 'favorites', 'mine', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'was', 'obvious', 'care', 'taken', 'script', 'story', 'animated', 'moment', 'costs', 'so', 'much', 'moment', 'matters', 'Everything', 'together', 'satisfying', 'literate', 'way', 'Watching', 'made', 'wish', 'more', 'live-action', 'filmmakers', 'took', 'half', 'much', 'care', 'stories', 'scripts', 'create', 'love', 'movies', 'general', 'always', 'have', 'honestly', 'past', '4-5', 'years', ""'m"", 'lucky', 'like', 'even', '2', '3', 'year', 'anymore', 'Two', 'other', 'things', 'really', 'struck', 'film:1', 'repeated', 'refrain', 'did', 'said', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'happiness', 'regret', 'disappointment', 'etc.', 'really', 'subtle', 'way', 'empowering', 'characters', 'take', 'responsibility', 'what', 'do', 'good', 'ill', 'really', 'that.2', 'fact', 'Toothless', 'Hiccup', 'are', 'mutual', 'support', 'system', 'friends', 'challenges', 'mirror', 'other', ""'ll"", 'say', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'film', 'found', 'incredibly', 'unique', 'kid', 'film', 'really', 'moving', 'poignant', 'deep', 'love', 'boy', 'dragon', 'will', 'resonate', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'much-loved', 'pet', 'bond', 'can', 'seem', 'mind-reading', 'simply', 'know', 'what', 'need', 'provide', 'it.All', ""'ll"", 'say', 'remaining', 'vague', 'was', 'tears', 'final', '5', 'minutes', 'film', 'emotions', 'were', 'too', 'complex', 'name', 'regret', 'joy', 'love', 'acceptance', 'enough', 'me.And', 'best', 'ending', 'film', ']', 'really', 'wallop', 'yet', 'utterly', 'unpreachy', 'just', 'satisfying', 'culmination', 'really', 'well-told', 'story', 'cute', 'little', 'animated', 'movie', 'kind', 'expected', 'forget', 'almost', 'as', 'soon', 'watched', 'totally', 'knocks', 'out', 'lot', 'depth', 'story', 'found', 'thinking', 'even', 'next', 'day', 'awesome', 'when', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did']",N/A

When he confronts his Viking ways he must decide for himself weather to dispatch his prey or will he come to an understanding of the true nature of the beast.  If you own cats you can see the dilemma and the conflict. Not that any feline is in danger of being dispatched.There is nothing unique about this movie.  The story is old as the hills. The animation while not intrusive to the message is not unique either. There are no news truths or insights or anything.  There is the standard minus and a boy coming of age with others attempting to do so also. It is refreshing to find the single family parent is the father however it is the old single parent family conflict. The one big flaw in the story is that the only dragon that could use befriending was targeted for dispatching by everyone including fellow dragons; what kind of message does that send?  I have to admit I did not read the book so I cannot compare the book/movie.On the positive side they picked some good voices (see the DVD extras) for the individual characters.

The actors are perfect, though it is not clear why the Vikings (played by Scotsmen Craig Ferguson and Gerard Butler) speak with a Scots accent while the kids (Jay Baruchel, America Ferrara) sound as if the stepped off a California beach. But it works. The story has been changed from the book series by Cressida Cowell on which the film is based in that the many types of dragons that frequent the Island of Berk start as protagonists. The slightly built Hiccup decides to capture a dragon with his cannon/net invention and surprises himself by knocking the dreaded Toothless out of the night sky, injuring him in the process. With another invention Hiccup fixes Toothless's problem and gains his trust, but he fears the reaction of the adults as well as his peers if they discover his pet dragon -- which, of course, they do.How to Train Your Dragon was nominated for two Oscars (best animated film, best original score) and to my mind it should have won BOTH. The score by John Powell is epic in its scope, and uses Celtic themes that play off the Scots accents. I rarely buy CDs of a film score, but I bought this one. The track ""Test Drive,"" accompanying the scene where Hiccup takes Toothless out for a spin, literally, is as good as many a John Williams classic and is stunning in its emotional ride. (The track by Jonsi (of the Icelandic group Sigur Ros) that plays over the credits is great in its own way but unnecessary.)My only complaint with Dragon is that the 3D screen ratio is 2.35:1 -- very wide screen. I have to agree with James Cameron in his decision to released Avatar at 1.78:1 because, he stated, the extra visible picture (rather than black bars) top and bottom on a wide-screen TV results in an enhanced 3D effect -- a greater sense of depth. I wish there were a bit more Dragon.But that is a small complaint relative to the grandeur of this animated film and its story and score.

1304228,A3FNQG7QWNP0RC,B002ZG97YM,Bob the Skull,"[0, 0]","Going into HtTYD, I was quite skeptical about the whole affair.  Being more of a Horror-Movie buff than anything else, I don't really expect much out of other genres - although, to be fair, I don't expect much out of Horror either.  Few movies have the kind of insight; synthesis of talent; and stellar presentation to win me over; and if you compound this general statement of artistic scarcity with a marked lack of even the most petty of scares, I'm usually ready to not watch and say that I did.  Well, this happens to be one of the occasions where I'm glad I was talked into watching.  Despite a silly, somewhat childish approach to the topic (although this was almost necessary, and actually lent the movie its charm), HtTYD does what few movies manage to do: it engaged me on an emotional level.  Indeed, even having watched this movie once before, I still found myself reacting as if I'd never seen it before - an unusual event for any artistic endeavor.Story-wise, from the standpoint of the generally accepted &#34;NO SPOILERS&#34; rule, there's not much to tell: Vikings kill dragons (like they do); boy meets dragon; boy saves everyone because of dragon.  But this simplicity does nothing to detract from the experience, as it's character interaction and dedication to the roles that wins the day on this venture.  Despite humor that ranges from goofy to pre-adolescent, never once did I feel myself becoming disengaged from the spectacle.  No one character is overbearing or underwhelming; and all of the actors manage to pull their roles together in a way that does nothing but show this gem for what it really is.  In short, and without being too mushy (which I doubt I could stand for more than a picosecond), the film does so much right as to make me promote it as a family classic.For those of you with a serous case of TLDR: good presentation and good acting turn a silly movie into a charming one that managed to make my day without even one drop of blood spilled - impressive for a bunch of Vikings.

1304242,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B002ZG97YM,buru buru piggu,"[1, 1]","How to Train Your Dragon is simply superb. It's a wonderfully heart-warming and beautifully animated film that's not only fun for kids, but also for adults. Of course, kids will love the big smashy Vikings and dragons, but for parents, grown-up kids and animation fans, there's plenty of other things to love: a kooky cast of characters, some witty and sarcastic dialog, and the lush and lovingly-rendered CG visuals. Dreamworks grows by leaps and bounds with each successive film in terms of animation technology, and this is their best work yet, looking even better than the fantasticKung Fu Panda [Blu-ray]. But besides that, it's got an entertaining story that audiences of all ages can appreciate.This is the story of a scrawny, wimpy boy named Hiccup, who lives in the village of Berk. The film begins with him introducing us to his miserable island ""twelve days north of Hopeless and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death"" and its pest problem-- dragons! Here's where the dragons come in and the scene quickly changes to one of comic chaos. As the Vikings run around fending off the fire-breathing raiders, Hiccup is told by everyone to get out of the way and get back inside. He desperately wants to impress the people of his village and earn their respect, especially his father, Stoick the Vast, the leader of their tribe and a brave Viking, who sees his son as a nuisance at best and a disappointment. During the raid, he makes a mess trying to help, but not without shooting down a rare and mysterious Night Fury first (the fiercest of them all). Problem is, no one believes him because he's such a bungler.Afterwards, Hiccup sneaks off to the woods to find the injured dragon with the intent of finishing the job and proving his Vikingness. He is unable to and over time, he befriends the dragon, who he names Toothless. He uses his blacksmithing skills to create a tail fin for his injured buddy and through Toothless, he learns a lot about taming and training dragons (hence the film's title). Hiccup eventually becomes proud of who he is and earns the respect of all his friends and villagers. At the end, we are treated to a spectacular fight in gorgeous 3D CG and he returns home a hero. Everyone is happy. Village is safe, father-son issues resolved, boy gets girl.It's all very wholesome entertainment with a good, positive story for kids and adults. Amusingly, the Viking characters all have Scottish accents, which is a stroke of genius. Many of the funnier, sarcastic lines are delivered by Gobbler (voiced by comedian Craig Ferguson), the one armed, one legged blacksmith, Stoick's 2nd in command, and Hiccup's mentor. Stoick himself is voiced by Gerard Butler (another Scot), who has played a Norse warrior before in the excellentBeowulf & Grendel [Blu-ray]. Stoick's animated mannerisms and gestures are perfectly captured! They look exactly like Butler's movements and facial expressions from other films and the animators did an excellent job bringing all the nuances to life onscreen. Ferguson and Butler's voices add a lot of personality to the film. The only thing I found annoying was Hiccup's voice (Jay Baruchel), who speaks in a nasal monotone and self-deprecating deadpan most of the time. I also didn't care for any of the other kid characters in the film.

To his father's dismay, he builds sophisticated devices to shoot at them. And this time, he succeeds. He shoots a mighty dragon out of the sky. And not any dragon, but a Night Fury, the fastest and deadliest of them all. But when the time comes to kill it, Hiccup hesitates, and a friendship is born between dragon and human.That summer, while the Viking warriors go into yet another quest to find the dragon's legendary nest and Hiccup and his peers learn how to fight against captured dragons, Hiccup trains his dragon.The return of the defeated warriors and a timely discovery sets humans against dragons in a final battle that will destroy them both unless Hiccup finds a way to stop it.How to Train Your Dragon is, no doubt meant for children, but it has a lot of charm and a strong story, not to mention a sympathetic protagonist, a cute dragon, and a girl with the coolest outfit (check her boots) this side of animation.

1304263,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG97YM,Chris Pandolfi,"[6, 9]","In the tradition of some of our better animated films, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" establishes a thoroughly engaging friendship between a boy and an animal -- so engaging that we do in fact hurt when it appears that one or both is in grave danger. Animated films have always had that kind of power over audiences, maybe because an animal gives the filmmaker the perfect opportunity to convey emotions at their most fundamental. When they're happy, they're completely happy. When they're sad, they're completely sad. When they suffer, they express themselves so clearly that we suffer right along with them. It matters not that, in this case, the animal is a dragon, which doesn't exist; in the world of an animated film, entertainment tends to take precedence over reality.The boy is a Viking teenager named Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel), an outcast amongst his people for being too short, too skinny, too clumsy, and too nonviolent in a village where dragon slaying is practically a religion. He thinks he wants nothing more than to be a mighty warrior, and for a good portion of time, he tries to get by in training, in which he's pitted against caged dragons in an arena of sorts. But after injuring and ensnaring a dragon all on his own -- an elusive and (supposedly) lethal kind, classified as Night Fury -- he finds he doesn't have the heart to kill it. He then befriends it, humorously dubbing it Toothless, and quickly realizes that his people have it all wrong: Dragons are not evil beasts that must be destroyed, but merely frightened creatures who are provoked into violence.Toothless, who hides in a clearing beyond a waterfall, is large, graceful, majestic, and ever so slightly cute. This is good, not only for the children in the audience, but also because we need to care for him just as much as Hiccup does. And speaking of Hiccup, he's now faced with the task of leading a double life. To everyone else, including his crotchety trainer Gobber the Belch (voiced by Craig Ferguson), he seems to have transformed himself from a village disgrace into one of the best dragon fighters the people have ever seen. This doesn't sit too well with the tough, athletic, determined Astrid (voiced by America Ferrera), Hiccup's secret crush; she becomes increasingly suspicious of him, especially since his methods of subduing the dragons are not exactly what one would call violent.Matters are further complicated by Hiccup's father, the brawny Stoick the Vast (voiced by Gerard Butler), who up until now has always been disappointed in his son. Unfortunately, he has become proud for all the wrong reasons. He has yet to find out about Toothless, and he still doesn't understand that Hiccup has absolutely no intention of ever killing a dragon in battle. It's a classic case of the reluctant parent struggling to understand his child, of never listening to the child when he's trying to say something he feels is important.Indeed, the general plot is a classic case, relying on themes of friendship, acceptance, and courage to get its point across. But what this movie lacks in original ideas it more than makes up for in heart, humor, and sheer visual spectacle, made stronger by its presentation in 3-D. Some of the film's most impressive scenes involve Hiccup riding on Toothless' back as he soars triumphantly above clouds, through craggy peaks, and over the sea; they're not merely stunning examples of camerawork and computer imagery, they're also exhilarating. And yes, there are a number of frenetic battle scenes, especially in the latter half of the film, at which point the Vikings are pitted against a monstrosity the likes of which no one has ever seen.All this is in good fun. But for my money, the strongest element of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" was the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless, who against all odds became the best of friends. There is nothing here we haven't seen before, but can you honestly say you weren't touched at some level? The moment when Toothless is finally trusting enough to butt his head against Hiccup's hand made my heart glad. Maybe I'm too sentimental, but there you have it. There are also some genuinely funny moments involving Hiccup's attempts to feed Toothless, one of them ending in a less than appetizing way.One could easily fault the minor details. Could any Viking, however muscular and well armed, physically defeat a gigantic winged reptile capable of breathing fire? Could anyone keep a large, noisy dragon a secret for as long as Hiccup did? Would no one have discovered the secret dragon nest long ago? If you think these questions are worth asking, you'd probably be better off seeing a different movie. ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" adapted from Cressida Cowell's book, is terrific family entertainment -- fun, heartfelt, and a pleasure to look at. Its greatest achievement is its ability to resonate emotionally, something all stories about unlikely friendships need in order to work. Without it, you'd have nothing more than a mindless action piece, with plenty to see but little to identify with.",4,"A Viking, a Dragon, an Unlikely Friendship",1269561600,"03 26,

Miller and Kristen WiigWRITTEN BY: William Davies, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders; based on the novel by Cressida CowellDIRECTED BY: Dean DeBlois and Chris SandersRated: PGGenre: Animation / FantasyRelease Date: 26 March 2010Review Date: 27 May 2010It's amazing how far animation has come; literally milestones from where it originated. It allows us to go on adventures no real life characters or actual movie sets could take us to. There are virtually no limitations in its magical world and How to Train Your Dragon dabbles in this splendid availability relentlessly.There's a reason movies like this and Avatar and Alice in Wonderland are raking in all the profits of consumers; they are the most fun to see in theaters. While I still remain a loyal patron to an abundance of movie stars, the days of an actor's name alone, filling seats are long gone for the majority of moviegoers. They want to be dazzled visually more than anything; thus the recent big to-do over 3-D and IMAX presentations. Bigger, brighter, and louder has now become better.The animation style is something we haven't seen very much of. The characters are all generated to look slightly less perfect than we know they could. Big eyes, obscure heads and hairdos, and their personalities are all modernized while the film has them placed back in the Viking era.Our hero is a boy named Hiccup and is ideally voiced by Jay Baruchel. Hiccups Dad is a massive burly Viking played by Gerard Butler and Hiccup may never live up to his manly expectations. His dad slays dragons and expects the same from him, and Hiccup just doesn't have the ambition to do this.That is lessened even more, when he befriends a dragon in the forest. The two meet when no one is around and soon begin meeting in secret on a regularly basis. Of course the dragon has a wounded wing, and Hiccup tends to it and earns the beast's trust.But what else would you have happen between a boy and a dragon? The film does not disappoint in making their connection enduring and fun-filled as the two take to the skies and bring us along for the ride.

I can't fairly judge foreign animated movies so I put the ""American"" disclaimer in front.  Watching this movie with my daughter was an absolute delight.  As I watched the story of Hiccup the Viking and his beloved dragon unfold, I became more engrossed in the story and found it very emotional and touching.  Points in the movie where you expect cliche things to happen they didn't, and I found the experience original and refreshing.Shrek was a nice and creative Dreamworks movie, but I didn't feel it competed with Pixars' best.  Kung Fu Panda was fine, but very formulaic.  This animated movie (I won't call it a kids movie because ANYONE can love this) I found to be one of the most original things I had seen since the original Lilo & Stitch (a movie that I would also put on said top 10 list) and there was a good reason why I kept thinking of Lilo & Stich.  As the credits popped up on the screen, there appeared the names of Chris Sanders & Dean DeBlois, the directors and creators of the original masterpiece.Believe the hype, this is 1 amazing movie and I can't recommend it highly enough.  Enjoy it once, twice, or 20+ times, this is a rare classic that comes around only once in a rare time, and Dreamworks has its magnum opus finally when it comes to animated films.***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION",5,Top 10 Animated Movie Of All Time,1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,1545,"['Animated', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'subjective', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'get', 'haters', 'lashing', 'out', 'statement', 'stand', 'opinion', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'one', 'top', '10', 'animated', 'movies', 'American', 'history', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fairly', 'judge', 'foreign', 'animated', 'movies', 'so', 'put', 'American', 'disclaimer', 'front', 'Watching', 'movie', 'daughter', 'was', 'absolute', 'delight', 'watched', 'story', 'Hiccup', 'Viking', 'beloved', 'dragon', 'unfold', 'became', 'more', 'engrossed', 'story', 'found', 'very', 'emotional', 'touching', 'Points', 'movie', 'where', 'expect', 'cliche', 'things', 'happen', 'did', ""n't"", 'found', 'experience', 'original', 'refreshing.Shrek', 'was', 'nice', 'creative', 'Dreamworks', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'competed', 'Pixars', 'best', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', 'was', 'fine', 'very', 'formulaic', 'animated', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'call', 'kids', 'movie', 'ANYONE', 'can', 'love', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'things', 'had', 'seen', 'original', 'Lilo', 'Stitch', 'movie', 'would', 'also', 'put', 'said', 'top', '10', 'list', 'was', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Lilo', 'Stich', 'credits', 'popped', 'up', 'screen', 'appeared', 'names', 'Chris', 'Sanders', 'Dean', 'DeBlois', 'directors', 'creators', 'original', 'masterpiece.Believe', 'hype', '1', 'amazing', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'Enjoy', 'once', 'twice', '20+', 'times', 'rare', 'classic', 'only', 'once', 'rare', 'time', 'Dreamworks', 'magnum', 'opus', 'finally', 'when', 'animated', 'films', '*****', 'HIGHEST', 'POSSIBLE', 'RECOMMENDATION']",N/A

It's almost as if standards are getting lower and what is mediocre is now great and what is actually great is nearly non-existent.  This is a poignant example.How to Train Your Dragon has an abundance of good reviews so, statistically, you might find yourself in that bucket and be reasonably pleased.  All hype aside, HTTYD is a pretty uninspiring story. You can guess the entire plot within the first few minutes.  Boy is an outcast, boy finds dragon, boy trains dragon, boy saves the day and becomes a hero.  The end.Now maybe this movie won't break ground in originality, but the execution is pretty poor too.  Nothing exceptional happens.  For anyone who has already seen this movie, I would ask &#34;What were some memorable lines?&#34; and &#34;Who were some memorable characters?&#34;.  The responses, I suspect, would be depressingly lackluster.I judge a movie by how much you retain after seeing it--whether there was some profound, emotional scene, a clever joke, or an enchanting musical score.

I wasn't at all interested in this film when it came out until some trusted associates began telling me how much they enjoyed the film. My curiosity was peaked and I rented the film and watched it with somewhat low expectations.The story is about a group of rising vikings that are being trained on how to kill a dragon. When scraggly, odd Hiccup manages to injure a dragon outside of school, he finds that he is unable to kill it as taught. He instead becomes determined to help the dragon recover and fly once more.This was a very good movie, and I'm not saying that because I had low expectations. DreamWorks seems to be a real hit-or-miss company with their animated films and this was the best one I've seen sinceKung Fu Panda. The story was a lot more interesting than expected and the blend of humor and action was very well played. The characters were likable and had believable personalities and development, and that goes for the dragons as well. The animation style was a bit different and I heard some people say that it was too much of a video-game look to be enjoyed, but there were still some stunning visuals in the film and some very creative moments. The voice acting was very well done and the musical score for the film was amazing!

From my point of view, they aim mostly for cheap laughs with mediocre stories. However, sometimes they do hit the right string and deliver a throughfully entertaining film with great visuals, characters and story. So far, from the 20-plus films that Dreamworks had released since its foundation, I found only five worth seeing and owning (Shrek, Shrek 2, Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit and Kung Fu Panda). When I walked to a Dreamworks film I never have high hopes like when I enter a Pixar film (all of which are excellent). This year was not the exception and when I saw trailers for How to Train Your Dragon, I never got too much excited about it. All I have to say is that I couldn't be more wrong!!For the first time, I feel that Dreamworks did a film that can be up there with the Pixar catalogue. I haven't seen such a great film produced by Dreamworks since the first Shrek was released. This movie is an instant classic!!Instead of aiming for sitcom-esque jokes like most of his films, HTTYD has what all Pixar films have: a wide appeal. This film can be enjoyed by every member of the family and has a good quality humor and most important of all, a heart (a thing that is usually missing from Dreamworks). Add breathtaking visuals, a magnificent score, action, great characters and you have one of the most compelling animated films of all time. I still think Pixar is better and in fact I think Toy Story 3 is better than this one but without a doubt with HTTYD, Dreamworks make a huge step formward and became closer to Pixar (a step that may have gone backwards again with the fourth and hopefully last Shrek). Do I have more confidence in Dreamworks films? Not really, we'll have to see how Megamind and future films stand. But even if is the beginning of a new era for Dreamworks or an isolated success, HTTYD is a masterpiece.The Blu-Ray transfer is gorgoeus.You can see every detail in the screen, absolutely magnificent. The 5.1 dolby true HD is equally impressive. The are many nice bonus features (including a new short). Most of them are short but they are fun to watch nontheless.The DVD provided here also looks great for SD but is no match for the BD quality.How To Train Your Dragon is an excellent film that is completely recommended (even if you don have kids like myself). Congratulations to Dreamworks for showing us that when they want to, they can do great things.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON (2010) is a delightful and beautifully animated fantasy-themed story, the story of Viking teen Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) and his endeavors to fit in with his village. Also, they have the usual nasty dragon infestation and that turns out being the key to Hiccup's success.This is one of the most beautifully finished, well-shot animated features I've seen since THE INCREDIBLES and SURF'S UP. While it is slightly lacking in vocal talent (the best they could do was Jay Baruchel and America Ferrara as their lead voices??) it certainly isn't lacking in story, humor, charm or pure animation accomplishment. While I will not spoil anything further, I have to skewer the animators on one point: why is the most important dragon in this film made to look like Stitch from LILO AND STITCH?The details, though, make that well worth enduring; I loved all the different funny dragons and the Runic book which Hiccup is studying intently during his dragonslayer training. Saying which, though this film does borrow a bit too liberally from DRAGONHEART, young viewers won't notice - and won't care.All I can add is this film brought a sorely needed smile to my face, and is one of the best animated features I've seen in years.

As a person who has read Cressida Cowell's series, I will be the first to admit this has not a single thing to do with its source book, but wow, this is an animated movie of heart among animated movies.  It's wonderfully simple while still boasting plenty of emotion. It's funny.  It's snappy.  The animation and music are gorgeous.  And hey, who doesn't love dragons?The story is of a Viking boy named Hiccup who is the worst Viking of his tribe. He's shrimpy, too smart-alecky for his own good, and he happens to be the over-protected son of the chief.  The tribe has been waging a centuries-old war with the dragons who prey on the same food suppy, so Hiccup believes that if he kills a dragon he will finally earn some respect.  So he invents a machine to shoot down a dragon, accomplishes the conceptual goal, and sets about killing it.  Only he is unable to.  Instead, he winds up making a pet out of the dragon he names Toothless.This movie is, by all definitions, adorable.  The kids will love the cute dragons, the teen set will love the hint of teen romance and all the action, and as an adult I was intrigued by both the relationships in the movie as well as the pure movie-making art.  Truly, there is something for everyone.The blu-ray/dvd is standard and suitable blu-ray/dvd entertainment, though it seemed most of the good stuff was added to the blu-ray, leaving the dvd itself with very little.  Still, we get the commentary (I love commentary), a pop-up fact track (lots of fun), deleted scenes (always interesting) as well as a fun little Viking personality quiz.  Not to mention the short movie, which I found quite enjoyable.  Nothing terribly special, but certainly worthy.Still, the reason to buy anything is the movie itself.

How To Train Your Dragon is simply stupendous, a must-see, and worth every penny you might spend on it.A young boy named Hiccup doesn't quite fit in with his Viking brethren considering his size, his affinity for clumsiness, and its destructive outcomes.  With a father called Stoic who leads the island home and community, Hiccup is determined to continually prove himself.  This desire manifests itself in the wish to kill a dragon, the pests that steal the food of the Vikings and burn down their village more often than not.  When Hiccup manages to shoot down a Night Fury, the dragon that nobody ever sees and never misses its target, his entire life changes along with his understanding of the creatures that are so very dangerous.The story is about friendship, trust, beauty, sacrifice, and understanding.  It's so well done that you instantly fall in love with Hiccup's demeanor and the Night Fury, Toothless.  Not only is the story stupendous, but the animation is something to applaud as well.

1304342,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B002ZG97YM,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[391, 417]","How to Train Your Dragon is the latest from the stable of Dreamworks, but apart from the animation style, you'd never know it.How to Train Your Dragon is the story of Hiccup, a Viking who feels out of place since he's not a fan of killing the dragons the Viking's world so revolves around in. But, when Hiccup captures the rare Night Fury Dragon and inadvertently injures it, the two become fast friends and attempt to bridge the gap of understanding between the Dragons & the Vikings. It may not sound like much, but things are deeper than they may seem here, and they are 3 reasons you need to go out and watch this movie right now.1: Casting: Having seen Jay Baruchel as a geeky character in the film Fanboys, this film only solidifies for me the fact that Baruchel makes cliched characters feel real & brings traits out they wouldn't have otherwise, and this fact is very evident here. The same is true for the rest of the cast. In Shrek 2, Larry King was wasted in a long-running and painful transvestite joke. Here, Craig Ferguson is perfect in the role not only because he's Scottish, but he brings the appropriate mix of eccentric leadership needed for the right-hand man of Gerard Butler's character, who is also well cast. The same goes for the rest of the cast with the possible exception of Jonah Hill, who always feels out of place in almost every movie he's in.2: Visual Effects & 3D: Now this may because the Viking environment hasn't been portrayed much on screen before, but the film is stunningly beautiful, and that's only reinforced by the 3D which is used better than Avatar in some cases, especially in the case of the flying sequences.3: The Emotion/Uniqueness of the Film in Animation Today: The story gives way to many emotional moments in the film, all of which are played perfectly. And, not to give too much away, but at the end of the film something happens the to main character that was not only shocking to me, since I'd never seen something of its magnitude done in animation period, but to me it was also one of the most tear-jerking moments, especially in relation to what it does to the relationships & similarities between Hiccup & his dragon in the movie.Overall, how do you train your dragon? With charm, love, understanding, amazing visuals & stunning 3-D flying sequences. This film ranks up there with Pixar's best, and if I had any criticism towards the movie, it would be the fact that it's made by Dreamworks, and with their quality lately, you don't have high expectation entering this film.

Sometimes it drove me nuts.Unfortunately, this film was pretty unfunny.  I can only remember one joke that I chuckled at, but it was a potty joke, go figure.The way the movie ended was dumb.  I'm sorry, but it bothers me when two kids start falling for each other so early.  Not to mention, the ending felt way too good to be true for the character.  Think about Toy Story 3 or Despicable Me where, while the endings are happy happy joy joy, it actually gives off some good emotion for the characters that makes us happy for them.  Here, the ending just felt too good to be true for the character, I mean, it's not like all of the character's troubles will be gone forever, and I expect an ending that isn't SOOO happy, sorry, maybe i'm a killjoy here, and it's not like I don't like happy endings, but I expect happy endings that has some emotion for the character.So wrapping up here, I enjoyed Rango more.

It takes you on a virtual ride on the back of a dragon and the film is a thrill ride in more ways than one.The story centers around a youth called Hiccup (Jay Baruchel also of Sorcerer's Apprentice) who is an under-achiever as far as the ways of the Vikings go. Unlike his father Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler also of The Ugly Truth) who is a much accomplished fighter and dragon killer, Hiccup is more of a brains than brawn type of guy.With his technical skills his is able to construct a device that is able to capture the mysterious Night Fury dragon (that no-one have ever been able to capture or kill). However, the device damages the dragon's tail, and he is no longer able to fly properly. Hiccup soon constructs an artificial tail piece for the dragon, and then he also makes a harness for the dragon and learns to ride it.Each time he goes for a ride on the dragon, it is like a surreal adventure in the skies. The adventure element of this film is pretty high, but there is also a lot of action sequences as the story develops.The voice acting is superb, and Jay's voice of uncertainty/frustration adds depth to his character and conveys his odd situations quite well, Gerard also does a very good job.The underlying message of this movie is not to judge anyone too quickly without knowing the full circumstances under which they are making their decisions.",4,"Putting aside Prejudice, Pests turn into Pets",1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,1509,"['graphics', 'feast', 'eyes', 'lot', 'breath', 'taking', 'wide', 'shots', 'meticulously', 'created', 'seaside', 'mountain', 'top', 'scenes', 'virtual', 'ride', 'back', 'dragon', 'film', 'thrill', 'ride', 'more', 'ways', 'one.The', 'story', 'centers', 'youth', 'called', 'Hiccup', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'also', 'Sorcerer', 'Apprentice', 'who', 'under-achiever', 'as', 'far', 'ways', 'Vikings', 'go', 'father', 'Stoick', 'Vast', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'also', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'who', 'much', 'accomplished', 'fighter', 'dragon', 'killer', 'Hiccup', 'more', 'brains', 'brawn', 'type', 'guy.With', 'technical', 'skills', 'able', 'construct', 'device', 'able', 'capture', 'mysterious', 'Night', 'Fury', 'dragon', 'no-one', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'able', 'capture', 'kill', 'However', 'device', 'damages', 'dragon', 'tail', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'fly', 'properly', 'Hiccup', 'soon', 'artificial', 'tail', 'piece', 'dragon', 'then', 'also', 'harness', 'dragon', 'ride', 'it.Each', 'time', 'ride', 'dragon', 'surreal', 'adventure', 'skies', 'adventure', 'element', 'film', 'pretty', 'high', 'also', 'lot', 'action', 'sequences', 'story', 'develops.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'superb', 'Jay', 'voice', 'uncertainty/frustration', 'depth', 'character', 'conveys', 'odd', 'situations', 'quite', 'well', 'Gerard', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'job.The', 'underlying', 'message', 'movie', 'not', 'judge', 'anyone', 'too', 'quickly', 'knowing', 'full', 'circumstances', 'are', 'making', 'decisions']",N/A

1304373,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002ZG97YM,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[30, 31]","Vikings are by all accounts burly, hairy, looming, and fierce, and that's probably just the womenfolk. Hiccup, the movie's sometime narrator, isn't your average tough and brawly Viking. Hiccup happens to be a hapless, noodly-figured, often scorned Viking teenager, and that his father is the intimidating village chief is maybe the sole reason why he isn't kicked more to the curb. Hiccup spends most of his days trying to prove himself to the warrior community. He only keeps on embarrassing himself. He's often relegated to the smithy, indoors and safe as the blacksmith's lowly apprentice.Hiccup's village sits on a desolate island, and it's a bleak living, made even more arduous by frequent encroachments of ravaging, fire-breathing dragons. Hundreds of years have seen these battle-craving Vikings hunting down these dragons, and Hiccup is expected to step into this manly habit. Except that Hiccup, an outsider and more introspective than most, will sort of accidentally topsy turvy that age-old tradition. But that's only if he makes it thru dragon slaying school. And if he survives his efforts to befriend the elusive Night Fury dragon.DreamWorks Animation still lags behind Pixar, but HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON goes a ways in garnering street cred for DreamWorks. It's real easy to get behind the story, its themes and philosophies, and the likable central character. The best things - or, rather, my favorite bits - about this film all have to do with Hiccup hanging out with his dragon and incidentally picking up invaluable insights in dealing with dragons. Toothless the Night Fury dragon is awesome and wonderfully expressive. Whenever Toothless springs into action, the film pulses with an exhilarating sense of adventure. These moments are when we're reminded that Toothless may be adorable but he's still very much a formidable presence. The message of tolerance and open-mindedness is naturally integrated into the story, so thankfully this doesn't at all feel like one of those very special Blossom episodes.The animation is really excellent, with the CG artists opting for more playful, more exaggerated renditions of the human characters and the dragons. The most realistically rendered elements turn out to be the atmospheric land-, sea-, and skyscapes. The dragon flights in this film are as breathtaking as those we saw in AVATAR. It makes me wish I'd seen this in 3D. I don't know why these Vikings have burry Scottish accents, but it does give us a chance to listen to the always funny Craig Ferguson (Gobber), so it's all good. Gerard Butler, who plays Hiccup's bullish father, channels his roaring persona from 300.So I've got the 2-DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature presentation and the following bonus stuff:- Audio commentary with Filmmakers Chris Sanders, Dean DeBlois, and Bonnie Arnold- ""Viking-Sized Cast"" has interviews with the voice actors (00:11:44 minutes long)- ""The Technical Artistry of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON"" - a focus on the film's state-of-the-art CG technology (00:10:13)- ""Get Your Game On"" previews the HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON and KUNG FU PANDA WORLD video games- Trailers to SHREK FOREVER AFTER, THE PENGUINS OF MADAGASCAR, THE LAST AIRBENDER, and the upcoming MEGAMIND- The trailer to and a Behind the Scenes segment on SHREK THE MUSICALThe second DVD offers the fun animated short, LEGEND OF THE BONEKNAPPER DRAGON. It runs at around 16 minutes long. Taking place some time after the events in the film, this one tells of how the blacksmith Gobber, Hiccup and his young Viking friends embark on a quest across the icy seas for the mythical Boneknapper dragon. But they end up stranded on a barren rock formation. This short also features moments of old school 2D animation (whenever Gobber is flashing back to one of his rather far-fetched stories). My biggest beef with this short: Toothless is barely in this one.Bonus material for this second DVD:- 3 Deleted Scenes from the feature film, done in rough storyboard sketches, with intros from Director/Co-Writer Dean DeBlois (total running time: 00:07:34 minutes)- ""The Story Behind the Story"" presents an interview with HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON author Cressida Cowell (00:07:40 minutes)- """"Racing for the Gold"" is a fun, quick, animated peek into four categories within the Viking Winter Games (bobsledding, speed skating, ski jumping, and snowboarding) and also the medal ceremony for that greatest of Viking sports, Dragon Training (the top medal is made out of ham)- Animator Gabe Hordos instructs on ""How to Draw Toothless"" (00:10:57)- ""Take the Viking Personality Test"" - Take a multiple-choice survey to learn which of the characters in the film you're most like- ""DreamWorks Animation Video Jukebox"" allows you to click on songs from previous DreamWorks animated flicks: ""I'm a Believer"" (SHREK), ""I Like To Move It, Move It"" (MADAGASCAR), ""Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting"" (KUNG FU PANDA), ""Rockin' the Suburbs"" (OVER THE HEDGE), and ""Here Comes the Sun"" (BEE MOVIE)- ""Dragon Activity Center"" - Insert this DVD into your PC and access the following DVD-ROM activities: ""Build Your Own Dragons"" (construct a life-size Toothless, a 3D Gronckle, a 3D Terrible Terror, and a 3D Night Fury) and ""Viking Zone"" (a peek at Viking Accessories, Viking & Dragon Masks, Flashlight Patterns, Growth Chart, Coloring Pages, and Stickers)",5,"""We're Vikings.

Despite his efforts, he usually failed to the chagrin of the town and the man (his father) who was its leader. Hiccup (a quite apt and funny name for this lad) one night decides to prove himself by launching a trap for the nefarious ""Night Fury"" dragon, and surprise, he snags one. Finding it wounded in the forest, the boy learns not only how to care for and train his dragon, but also, how to find his own unique footing in his life. Such is the tale of the heart warming and wonderfully vivid family family, ""How to Train Your Dragon.""Created by Dreamworks, which always seems to be in the shadows of the superstar Pixar, has finally come into its own with this cinematic experience. One of the first things you might notice is the spectacular flying sequences between Hiccup and Toothless. The magic of the animation is spotless, and what even makes it more breathtaking is the fact that there is little to no dialogue in these scenes. That adds to the splendor of seeing Hiccup fly, both literally and symbolically, over his village and life.Dreamworks concentrated on the usual Pixar strengths, of story, of character, of heart. This movie has all three, and all three in spades. The ending of the movie, which shant be revealed here, is one worthy of a few Kleenex. I, a somewhat cynical and hardened viewer to sentimental scenes, was totally taken off kilter by the enchanting surprise of emotion embedded in the context of the film. Dreamworks nailed it.Parents, be wary of very young kids seeing this film. I would have no problems having my second grader on up seeing this film, but anyone younger may have trouble with some scary dragon scenes, especially towards the end, warranting the PG rating.However, what lingers with me after seeing this movie is the strong relationship threaded throughout, esepcially between our hapless hero Hiccup and his man-killing dragon Toothless. For ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is in itself a wonderful metaphor, for never judging people too harshly before one gets to know them a little bit, and the benefits reaped when one does.

1304403,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B002ZG97YM,Jason,"[7, 8]","DreamWorks has hit an absolute homerun with How to Train Your Dragon.  Holding its own against anything from Pixar, the animation is nearly unparalleled.  The story of Hiccup (Baruchel), a gangly Viking teen with pipe-cleaner arms, is one of courage, understanding, and acceptance.  When all other Vikings are learning to engage in war or actually battling the evil dragons alongside Hiccup's conspicuously-named father Stoick (Butler), young Hiccup must ignore his fears and unfortunate name to show the others a more delicate and ultimately superior approach toward winning over the dragons.The primary draw of HTTYD is of course the animation.  One scene in particular shows multiple characters flying over an ocean that literally made me want to dive in.  The waves, the colors, the breakers, the motion, it was all perfect.  The water itself could have been replaced in any non-animated movie and not a sole would have noticed.  The rest of the animation came in a close second, with amazing detail in every blade of grass, every eyebrow raise, every gust of wind.  Stunning.Not simply a movie for the kids, this is perfect for all ages.  It's truly wonderful, with all facets of comparably good films represented.  The score is magnificent, allowing a viewer to be absorbed into the action.  The characters are well developed, diverse, interesting, and heartwarming; they blend perfectly.  The story itself is a classic tale of underdog winning by unorthodox methods to save the day, become famous, and get the girl.  Nearly everything works together seamlessly.In my opinion, there are only minor negatives of the film.  First and foremost, Jay Baruchel's nasally, whining voice fits the character, but comes across as fingernails on a chalkboard.  The other flaw as I see it, and it is admittedly minor, is the grayed moral relativism.

1304412,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B002ZG97YM,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[3, 3]","Dreamworks has scored a major hit with this fun movie that the entire family will enjoy.Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a young viking-in-training.  Pressured by his father Stoick the Great (Gerard Butler), Hiccup is supposed to learn how to slay dragons like all vikings do. Hiccup has been led to believe that all dragons are evil and must be killed before the dragons kill them.  Believing what he's been hearing, Hiccup makes a special weapon of his own to bring down one of the feared dragons.Hiccup manages to bring down a night fury; the most feared dragon of all.  But instead of being excited for his deed, Hiccup feels bad for the injured dragon.  Soon, the two have become close friends, and Hiccup has named him Toothless.  In no time, Hiccup has fashioned a saddle and is soaring high in the sky on Toothless' back.But, Hiccup still has his father to deal with.  Stoick, thrilled at Hiccup's bringing down the dragon, has insisted that he begin formal dragon training.  The only thing that Hiccup likes about it is that he gets to be near Astrid (America Ferrera).  During the course of his training, Hiccup begins to learn that the dragons aren't really evil at all; they are just like the vikings, hoping to survive.  However, convincing his father will be another matter.  Hiccup and Toothless soon discover that the dragons are merely pawns in a larger game controlled by a huge, menacing creature.  Will Hiccup, Astrid, and the others be able to save the dragons, or will the creature destroy both the dragons and the vikings?I've seen numerous animated movies with my children, and I have to rate ""How to Train Your Dragon"" as one of the best.  The special effects are excellent, and the story is good, too.  I enjoyed watching the relationship develop between Hiccup and Toothless, and the comedy left me laughing out loud.

1304413,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B002ZG97YM,Jem,"[4, 12]","I've been recommended this film many times since it was released, and it has tons of glowing reviews, so I expected to love it.  I'm obviously in the minority, but I do not think this even comes close to rivaling a Pixar film for quality.  My husband and my mom watched this with me (no kids).  We have enjoyed many Pixar films, but all agreed this was disappointing.  Yes, this is an excellent film for kids, but not for adults.  I did love that the dragons had cat-like characteristics.  It was an interesting take on them that brought some humor to the story.  Plus, the graphics were top notch.  Visually, the movie is great.  However, it is the story that falls short.This felt like a 30 minute film had been stretched to an hour and a half.  The entire first hour was very slow, even boring at times.  It's almost 45 minutes in before Hiccup even starts training the dragon.  And the story has a ""been there, done that"" feel.  Scrawny kid that no one respects, bullied by his peers, uses intelligence to save the day.  A great lesson sure, but lacking originality.  Plus, none of the characters stand out besides Hiccup.  After watching the film, I cannot recall the name of any other character besides him and Toothless!  What saved the film for me, and the reason I gave it 3 stars, is that the last 20-25 minutes were fantastic.  It was a very exciting, action-packed happily-ever-after conclusion. I would watch that part again.  Overall I am glad I did not pay theatre prices to see this.  I understand that a sequel has already been green-lit. I might give it a try if it has a more original storyline.

1304428,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,B002ZG97YM,J. Munyon,"[2, 3]","Craig Ferguson's voice is a perfect natural for this 2010 release Viking based, animation film, ""How To Train Your Dragon.""  Yes you need to bring your imagination and let go of being too much of an adult as you view this 2010 release.  Dreamworks gets a big kudos from me for their efforts sharing the epic story of Hiccup (Viking young lad) befriending a dangerously lethal, special forces dragon he names ""Toothless"" (retractable teeth).We all have a sentimental romantic concept of what and who the Vikings were back there in the Dark Ages from 800 A.D. to 1000 A.D. with their two handed battle axes that could split armor and shields with ease, arriving by longboats in or around regions such as Constantinople, Iceland, Russia, Greenland, Newfoundland, Ireland, Britain and other parts of Europe known as Scandinavian (Norse) savages, explorers, warriors, merchants, and pirates, and one of my favorite depictions of those rough hewn enduring epic folklore people was brought to the screen in a 2005 film named ""Beowulf & Grendel"" starring (pay attention) Stellan Skarsgard, Ingvar Eggert Sigurdsson, Gunnar Eyjolfsson, Philip Whitchurch, Ronan Vibert, Rory McCann, Hring ur Ingvarsson, Elva Osk Olafsdottir, Olafur Darri Olafsson, Steinunn Olina Persteinsdottir, (I'm not kidding) and one other name that helped make this earlier epic saga film authentic and believable, which of course was the outstanding actor Gerard Butler.Well, heed my warning about that 2005 version of ""Beowulf & Grendel"" being not for the squeamish or easily-given-nightmares type viewer.  THAT film isn't animation, it uses real people, with real places, and realistic terror.  Although not as terrifying as the 1999 release of ""The 13th Warrior"" with Antonio Banderas (also an epic saga about Vikings), ""Beowulf & Grendel"" (2005 release with Gerard Butler) still has its moments.On the other hand, ""How To Train Your Dragon"" is animated.  Therefore it by default isn't intended to be as frightening to the point of heart stopping dread and intrepidation.  It still can be pretty scary at times though for any child under 10 years of age.  The ancient dragon king that comes out of the abyss can be interpreted by impressionable minds as equivalent to the devil out of hell (which is terrifying for the deeply religious).  I'm just giving you a heads up for that potential, I'm not saying it was intentional by the makers of ""How To Train Your Dragon.""Gerard Butler is the voice of a main character (the dad) in this 2010 animated film, and has obviously studied the Viking culture.  Whereas I will readily agree you can't help but fall in love with the dragon dubbed ""Toothless"" I also have to add my perspective that it isn't only the weak, frail, timid, and outcast kid (who fails at almost everything else) who can and does have wisdom and empathy enough to consider sentient life worth respect and having a charitable ""live and let live"" objectivity as a good way of discovering that everybody else's enemy isn't necessarily your enemy too.  But putting aside the idea that a fierce, deadly, gruesome ""night fury"" dragon can be trusted unconditionally to love a helpless boy enough to team up with an otherwise useless failure personality and become heroes (which has a spectrum of connotations that almost gave me an aneurysm), if you can overlook how a father who disowns his son and gives up on mentoring him to be equipped for survival and acceptance among his own people, then later on after the son does the most rebellious, against-the-grain thing imaginable, the dad tells him how he's proud of him, well then if you can overlook those details, then yes this is a good movie.The point I'm trying to make is you can over analyze anything.  This movie is supposed to be an escape from reality, softening and conquering what frightens us, overcoming brutal ignorance from those who would barricade our dreams, and making friends out of otherwise potentially deadly enemies.  Come away with Hiccup to an island called Berk, where he wins the heart of his overly macho village champion father by making friends with a few of the dragon creatures who make a habit of destroying their homes and food supplies, and maim their fellow villagers who manage to survive.  Try to forget the psychological impetus possibilities off on whatever tangent, and just enjoy the awesome depiction of camaraderie that you don't have in your own reality.  It is a cartoon for crying out loud.  Let go of logic, and step into fantasy.  You know, like believing your boss knows how valuable you are on your real life job.Very enjoyable, fun, and I wish I had a dragon friend like ""Toothless.""  Buy this DVD movie and enjoy it over and over with the family (except kids under 10 who might have nightmares).

To start off, the movie is virtually nothing like the books, in that the story revolves around Hiccup, a klutzy Viking boy, his father, village chief Stoick the Vast, and a girl he likes, Astrid and most importantly Toothless, a dragon he attempts to kill and later befriends.This animated movie begins with a narration by Hiccup about his village, and about how dreadful life is there, especially due to the pest problem - dragons! It seems the only reason these Vikings haven't abandoned this gloomy area is because of their stubbornness issues. As the story evolves, the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless (who doesn't quite live up to that name!) becomes stronger, and they both discover the truth about dragons and why they are such big nuisance, and they both team up to keep the village safe and to free the dragons.The Legend of the BoneKnapper Dragon is a short movie that's very funny that's a good short to see after seeing the main movie.Overall this is a great story that will appeal to all age groups, and the animation is superb, with wonderful music throughout!

1304435,A9TG2NFA614S9,B002ZG97YM,John F. Rooney,"[1, 1]","""How to Train Your Dragon"" -- I saw this animated film on an Imax screen in 3D, and it was a delightful experience. The setting is a Viking village where the men are big, brawny, husky warriors, and the wives are pretty imposing as well. The village is besieged by dragons in all sizes, shapes and colors who swoop down and take away livestock and anything else edible. Hiccup is a nerdy kid whose father does not have faith in him as a dragon-slayer. The kid does bring down a dragon, but no one believes him.He goes hunting for the downed dragon and finds that he has only wounded it, shot off one of its tail fins so it is unable to fly. The kid miraculously befriends the dragon, and clever boy that he is makes a new rudder-operated tailfin for the dragon. The boy learns that dragons are basically friendly, and they can be tamed and made into pets.The scenes where the boy on his home-made saddle goes soaring through the air on the back of the dragon are worthy of scenes in ""Avatar."" He wins over a girlfriend by showing her his prowess with dragons. The boy is clever, resourceful, a good artist, and compassionate.Most animated films made primarily for children have worthy lessons to impart which are embedded in the story. They don't preach but they do teach. Hiccup's super-macho father comes to admire and respect the boy's skills, and they are brought closer together.The movie is a mixture of daredevil action sequences, comedy, pathos, and the need for empathy between man and natural creatures. Kids, I think, will learn a lot about Viking ships, costumes, customs, food, and the world of the early Norse society where men were men, and the women were hefty too.The movie becomes somewhat cutesy in the old Disney style when the dragon becomes endearing and coy.

Hiccup was on a search mission for th Night Fury. He found it and was going to kill it, but he couldn't because the dragon was scared. He keeps visiting the wounded dragon, and forms a friendship with the dragon. He start to learn how to fly and becomes somewhat of an expert, He starts to call the dragon, Toothless.

A truly fresh take on an ages-old plot, with probably the finest computer animation to date.  Although somewhat predictable, the plot, action, and emotional involvement only get better throughout the picture; no anticlimaxes or lame ending here.  Hiccup's warm sarcasm, hard-working character, and take-it-on-the chin attitude are very constantly likeable.  Toothless the Night Fury is a CGI masterpiece, and his unique and spellbinding 'performance' makes him one of the most immediately loveable characters invented for the screen - ever.  He is a rare piece of truly original and beautiful design in a time of re-hashed, copy-cat, crass, run-of-the mill animation.  The relationship that develops between the main characters happily surpasses the medium of 3D animation and stamped plastic DVD and his truly well written and heart warming.  The humor is also well timed and appropriate, understandable to children and adults alike (The 'breastplate' gag is real winner and tactfully presented).  But, best of all, this one readily endures repeated viewing as it is not too long, the plot moves along quite well, and the CGI work is enthralling - especially the final scenes.

Lord knows that they have their work cut out for them.But, they're learning, and it's not necessarily from flattering imitation that Dreamworks is quickly becoming a worthy challenger to Disney's powerhouse.  Nope; they deserve more credit than that.It began with Shrek, cemented itself with Kung Fu Panda, and now comes to fruition with Peter Hastings' Dragons.  And, although not everything it throws at us accompanies its soaring to the heavens, this is still something very special.There's an innocent majesty present here that not even Pixar replicates on a regular basis.  Some could say that this is hollow alternative wording for a movie that simply knows how to present itself, but it goes beyond that.  Here is finally an animated film that strikes the perfect core with 3D cinema.It exhilarates without overplaying, without shamelessly capitalizing upon the gimmicks that can accompany this new breed of filmmaking.  Rather, this film flexes its engine with grace, and the results are quite awesome, particularly during the flying sequences.From a structural standpoint, the plot stretches itself thin over the course of an hour and forty minutes.  It's timely and developed without an ounce of sagging or clumsiness, but the charming nature owes its strengths largely to the loving craft that the tech artists have put into the characters and their chemistry with one another.  The dragons, especially, affix themselves to our adoration with their quirks and oddly feline idiosyncrasies.Predictably enough, these reptiles are the undisputed stars of the show, and they make every scene worthwhile, even when the pacing drags at the midpoint.  Still, you cant criticize the team from taking a methodical approach to the character development, and it eventually pays off in the long run.The film gets another massive boost from its two lead performances, perhaps forming one of the most unlikely effective pairs yet seen in Dreamworks Animation.  Both Butler and Baruchel couldn't be better as father and son, making their plays off of one another sound easy.  It goes a long way towards making the drama effectively moving.All of this aside, I suppose I must admit that this is a film about dragons flying around, through and through.  Everything stems from this strength and, taking this solely into consideration, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a staggering success.  Neither vikings nor dragons have been very successful at the box office, and it takes a lot of work for an animation team to rise from the shadows of their establishes superiors.

I am not a big fan of Dreamworks (excluding Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, Over The Hedge, and now this) but I must admit, this movie really took me by surprise.Jay Baruchel plays the main character Hiccup;the funny thing is, I can relate to his character. I myself know what it is like to feel like you can't make the people closest to you or the people around you proud. Gerard Butler brings the mighty force he had in 300 to voice Hiccup's father Stoick who is ruler over the vikings, he did a good job. America Ferrera plays Astrid the fearless girl who Hiccup has a crush on, Jonah Hill stars as Snotlout, Hiccup's cousin, Craig Ferguson portrays Gobber, and Christopher Mintz Plasse stars as the know it all about dragons, Fishlegs. The Cast was excellentAnother thing I happen to find surprising and worth mentioning is the film itself is really deep for a kid's movie, no I mean SERIOUSLY it is. Maybe I feel that way because the title character is more relatable for myself; I do not know. Toy Story 3 is the only animated film I can remember actually crying at, and although this movie does not exactly bring tears, it does have just as much emotion and a strong positive influence behind it.How To Train Your Dragon is not only smart, but is one of the more visually impressive, creative movies I have seen when it comes to animation.

I'm a sucker for animation movies, so this was on my list to check it out. Which I did and I got to say, I loved it. When I watched the whole thing my first thought was this movie seemed a lot less generic like most movies are of today. That and well, dragons are cool no matter what age you are! The movie had almost no cliches that I can think of and felt like someone really did put some thought into this rather than basing the movie on pop culture and recycled ideas (see Shrek- I'm a Shrek fan as well, but that's what they do). There's really not a bland moment and I have a serious case of jitters where if something remotely bores me I got to go and do something else. This movie, however, achieves my attention. I can watch the movie from beginning to end without any problems.Movie Overview(In a Nutshell):I hate people giving me spoilers on the movies I'm about to watch, so I like to spare people of that myself, but here's just a little overview of the movie. Hiccup is the son of a viking leader who can't seem to impress anyone, including his father. After he takes down the baddest and fastest dragon (a Night Fury), they laugh at him, and he's sent home. Hiccup, however, has a problem with obeying and slips out the back door (literally) to check out his catch. He finds out he does catch it, but also finds out that the fear the dragons put into them is a mutual feeling amongst those they despise the most. After seeing he damaged the dragon's flying abilities, he decides to help him out, but can dragons and humans co-exist?The Likes:Hiccup is great for a few laughs, but in my opinion the comedy comes from the main dragon, Toothless. At first glance he looks like he could rip your head off, but then you will realize that he's as gentle as a cat (which is what he reminds me of). He's spunky, got's attitude, and is very intelligent. The plot is great and feels new, which is a major plus with me. I HATE generic movies and this doesn't feel like that. The ending is also pretty good as well.The Dislikes:Well, I can't really think of any to be honest, but I guess if I was to pick one it would be, I think it needs a cliffhanger. There's a planned sequel for 2014, so why not put a cliffhanger in there? Other than that, I can't think of any.Animation Domination or Animation Abomination?: Definitely Domination.

My husband, 13 and 5 year old daughters, and I selected this movie for family movie night a few weeks ago, and we all liked it very much.  HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is a sweet, adorable movie, beautifully rendered, with a kind-hearted messages.DreamWorks really did a nice job with HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON.  In HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, we meet Hiccup, the son of a Viking chief.  Hiccup is, well, different that the other Viking kids; he is skinny, smart, and not particularly interesting in killing things.  Unfortunately, their village is constantly under attack by dragons, and all children must learn to become dragon hunters.  Hiccup does try to kill dragons, but he always fails, often times making things worse for his village.  Finally, through a stroke of pure luck, Hiccup manages to bring down a dreaded Night Fury dragon; but, of course, no one sees it happen.  Not even his father believes his story.  Tenderhearted Hiccup cannot bring himself to kill the dragon, who he names Toothless.  Instead the two bond and form a fast friendship, Hiccup learns how to tame dragons without killing them, and in the end, saves his village and his people from an even worse threat.The plot of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is story we have all heard before, countless times, but, quite frankly, we didn't care at all.  The animation is gorgeous, the voice actors are quite talented, and the tale is very charmingly told.  My 5 year old loved it (and wants repeated viewings), the 13 year old declared it okay (which at this age is EXTREMELY high praise), and my husband and I enjoyed ourselves.  The messages are clear and kid appropriate:  1. Don't do things just because they've always been done that way.  2.  Think for yourself.  3.  Get to know your enemy.  If you can't remember why you are fighting, it might be time to stop.HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is good family entertainment, perfect for a quiet evening at home.  My kids now want pet dragons.

It's a kid movie with enough stuff to draw in the adults and keep their attention, too, but they took it beyond dragons. There is a mini makeout scene. And the tough girl love interest throws out some very realistic stand-in ""cuss"" words during a temper tantrum. Not needed.

1304465,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B002ZG97YM,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","I begin this review with a disclaimer -- I have not read the ""How To Train Your Dragon"" books.  Normally I will pass on a movie until I have read the book it is based on (such as ""Holes""), or will hunt down and read the book once I learn a particular movie is an adaptation (such as ""The Never-Ending Story"" or ""The Last Unicorn"").  And in most cases I find the book superior.  However, I'm also a HUGE dragon enthusiast, and so I opted to watch the movie in theaters before reading the books.  I already knew that the movie would probably be very different from the books, but I figured even if the movie bombed, it would still be fun to watch the dragons in action.I still haven't read the books... but the movie remains one of my favorite animated movies of all time, and I eagerly await the sequel.Hiccup is a scrawny blacksmith's assistant in the village of Berk, a Viking town that's frequently besieged by fire-breathing dragons who burn down houses, steal livestock, and otherwise make life difficult for the inhabitants.  While Hiccup's father, Chief Stoick the Vast, plans an attack that should keep the dragons away from Berk forever, Hiccup tries to improve his miserable standing in the village by killing a dragon of his own.  His efforts go awry, and he instead ends up befriending an injured dragon, a mysterious Night Fury named Toothless.  Over time he comes to learn and understand more about his reptilian friend and others of his kind, and learns that much of what the Vikings think they know about dragons is wrong.  But when the village plans an assault against the dragons' home, one that could have devastating consequences for Viking and dragon alike, it's up to Hiccup, Toothless, and the rough-and-tumble Viking girl Astrid to stop the attack and unite humankind and dragonkind... before an even worse threat than the dragons is set free.DreamWorks has been somewhat infamous for making films that rely too much on pop culture references, gross-out humor, and cheap slapstick -- the ""Shrek"" films, ""Madagascar"" films, and ""Shark Tale"" were particularly infamous in this regard.  ""How To Train Your Dragon"" does have some slapstick and bodily-function humor (with the infamous ""hat scene"" being the most notable), but for the most part it draws much of its humor from snarky wit and situational humor, and it doesn't fall back on quickly-dated pop culture references to be funny or to appeal to adults.  This is a refreshing turn for DreamWorks, and a trend they seem to be continuing with in their more recent films, such as ""Kung Fu Panda"" and ""Rise of the Guardians.""The characters are fun bunch as well.  Many kids will identify with Hiccup's quest to fit in, and his fascination with the world around him and his willingness to learn and adapt are great character traits.  The other Viking kids and teens are a varied bunch -- obnoxiously arrogant Snoutlout, nerdy and scaredy-cat Fishlegs, warrior girl Astrid, and the rude and ever-bickering twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut -- but help provide some memorably funny scenes.  Stoick and Gobber are the only notable adults in the film, but they're strong and even sympathetic characters, and its hard not to like them.  And Toothless, despite having no actual dialogue, is a great character all his own, the right mix of awesome and adorable and with some of the best facial expressions in the film.The animation in this film is spectacular as well, right up there with Pixar's best.  The dragons are all imaginatively designed, some spiky and toothy, some streamlined and sleek, and some chubby and knobbly.  Someone had a LOT of fun designing these beasties, and many of them look to be direct homages to the illustrations from the original books.  And the flight scenes in the movie are incredibly done, with fantastic visuals and amazing camera tricks.  This movie must have been a blast to see in 3D...One of DreamWorks' best films, this is an amazing movie, and even if it's vastly different from the books it's still well worth your time.  I just hope the sequel is good too...

1304474,A3LZBOBV9H1HDV,B002ZG97YM,"Kris King ""Kristopher""","[2, 3]","""How To Train Your Dragon"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: A Viking teenager named Hiccup lives on the island of Berk, where fighting dragons is a way of life. The teen's smarts and offbeat sense of humor don't sit too well with his tribe or its chief... who just happens to be Hiccup's father. However, when Hiccup is included in Dragon Training with the other Viking teens, he sees his chance to prove he has what it takes to be a fighter. But when he encounters (and ultimately befriends) an injured dragon, his world is flipped upside down, and what started out as Hiccup's one shot to prove himself turns into an opportunity to set a new course for the future of the entire tribe.The voice cast led by Jay Baruchel (as Hiccup) & Gerard Butler (as Stoick) is excellent! The directing by Chris Sanders (he also did the stories to ""Beauty And The Beast"" (1991), ""Aladdin"" (1992) & ""The Lion King"" (1994, also did the production design) & Dean DeBlois (both of them also wrote & directed ""Lilo & Stitch"" (2002) is brilliant!

The production design by Kathy Altieri (who also did the production design to ""Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron"" (2002), ""Over The Hedge"" (2006), she also did the art direction to ""The Prince Of Egypt"" (1998) is brilliant!

I simply can't think of anything that would make it better.I'm pretty conservative with giving movies 5 stars.

(With the exception of Toy Story 3.)BUT this one hit the right mark and goes straight into my Favorite Movies of All Time list.  It manages to be exciting, subtle, endearing, hilarious, awe-inspiring, poignant and thrilling.  The beginning, the middle, the end and everything in-between are all just right.  So, so rare to find that.  Need I mention the animation and graphics?  Jaw-dropping.  The soundtrack?  The production design? The script? The voice-acting? The story itself?  And ohhhhh, the dragons!  Can't resist.  Have to go with awesome!

Awesome animation, great story line, extremely entertaining & suitable for family viewing ... almost. The exception being very, very young children. Albeit this movie is animated & most certainly suitable for children, it contains scenes in which dragons are growling, baring their teeth & attacking children which may frighten the very youngest among us. I enjoyed How To Train Your Dragon immensely & I highly recommend it for family viewing at the PARENTS DISCRETION. Parents know their children. What may frighten one four year old may not frighten another. As we have both a DVD player & a Blu-Ray player, it is nice having this movie available on both DVD & Blu-Ray discs. Most especially in the event either player should break down or eventually become obsolete. Price point is always a consideration. However, Amazon priced this Duo just right. Both the DVD & Blu-Ray Versions are in Widescreen format & of course, both are in Color. The Blu-Ray is 1080p HD in English 5.1 Dolby True HD. Other languages include French, Spanish & Portuguese all of which are in 5.1 Dolby Digital. Subtitles include English, English SDH, French, Spanish & Portuguese.

1304498,A204UDH31JJ5ZW,B002ZG97YM,Logan Stewart,"[1, 1]","Call me a sucker for animated films, but I can't help it.  They're almost always a win in my book, as I usually find myself engrossed in the world of CGI.  DreamWorks new feature, How to Train Your Dragon, fits great into the scads of computer-animated films that I like to say I enjoy.The story takes place on the island of Berk.  Young Hiccup, the Viking chief's son, is a walking disaster.  Everything he touches breaks.  Even venturing outdoors often invokes fear and awe in the villagers.  Hiccup is a scrawny lad, lacking all the rugged muscle and bulk all the other Viking's have.  His father is the most famous of all dragon slayers, and though Hiccup longs to be like everyone else, he's hampered by his physique.But Hiccup has more than just daddy issues to work on.  His village is constantly attacked by dragons.  They come in the night and steal their livestock, burning down the homes as they fight the mighty Vikings.  One night, during an attack, the dreaded Night Fury, a dragon so mysterious and dangerous that no one's ever even seen one, shows up.  Hiccup, in an effort to prove himself, decides that he will capture and kill the Night Fury, thus earning his father's respect, the admiration of the town, and the heart of the cute little blond Astrid he's had his eyes on.  While the village is occupied with the dragons, Hiccup sneaks away and launches his plan, and things will never be the same...As I mentioned, I really like animated films.  They seem to pack more of a punch than many live-action movies.  Mayhap this is because we feel a little safer when dealing with imaginary situations.  Maybe it's because we see them as children's movies and we let our guard down.  Whatever the case is, many of the computer-animated films deal with heavy issues (see Up if you don't believe me).  How to Train Your Dragon was no different, dealing with daddy issues, self-confidence, and moral objection of societal views to name a few.  And while movies like this often have ""feel good,"" happy endings, I don't feel cheated or mislead when I see them.  No, I cheer.  Our lives have too many problems as it is.  If I can see achievement and accomplishment in someone else, even if that someone is a computer-animated Hiccup, then I can find meaning and apply it to my life as well.This movie is different from other CGI films, too.  I was expecting a lot more comedy (like Shrek) thrown in with the adventure, but instead it was the other way around.  The worldbuilding is massive and creative, filled with possibilities for adventure, and our hero finds himself on one.  The movie does succeed in delivering funny jokes/scenes, but honestly I was more excited about the plot.My favorite thing of the film, however, was definitely the dragons.  (What fantasy reader can resist dragons when they're done right?)  The writers have imagined many different kinds of dragons.  Some are small and dorky looking.  Some are fierce monsters as large as a building.  Some have thick scales.  Some have multiple heads.  All of them were visually stunning and beautiful.  Yes, there are plenty of dragons in the movie, and my favorite was definitely the Night Fury.  This dragon reminded me of my pet dog Stella.  Some of the mannerisms and actions were identical, so it was hard for me not to like the Night Fury.  In addition, the relationship between the dragon and Hiccup was endearing and heartfelt, harkening up familiar feelings to anyone that's ever owned and loved a pet.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.  I watched it in 3D (as we had my 8-yr-old brother-in-law with us), and it was impressive, but plain-ole 2D would have easily sufficed.  DreamWorks has some failed movies in its past, but How to Train Your Dragon isn't one of them.  I can easily recommend the movie for anyone who wants to be thrilled and entertained.  To me, it was worth the full-price of the movie ticket(s) on a weeknight, so that's saying something",5,"A Beautiful, Funny Animated Adventure",1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,3944,"['Call', 'sucker', 'animated', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', ""'re"", 'almost', 'always', 'win', 'book', 'usually', 'find', 'engrossed', 'world', 'CGI', 'DreamWorks', 'new', 'feature', 'How', 'Train', 'Your', 'Dragon', 'great', 'scads', 'computer-animated', 'films', 'like', 'say', 'enjoy.The', 'story', 'place', 'island', 'Berk', 'Young', 'Hiccup', 'Viking', 'chief', 'son', 'walking', 'disaster', 'Everything', 'breaks', 'Even', 'venturing', 'outdoors', 'often', 'invokes', 'fear', 'awe', 'villagers', 'Hiccup', 'scrawny', 'lad', 'lacking', 'rugged', 'muscle', 'bulk', 'other', 'Viking', 'have', 'father', 'most', 'famous', 'dragon', 'slayers', 'Hiccup', 'longs', 'be', 'everyone', 'else', 'hampered', 'physique.But', 'Hiccup', 'more', 'just', 'daddy', 'issues', 'work', 'village', 'constantly', 'attacked', 'dragons', 'come', 'night', 'steal', 'livestock', 'burning', 'down', 'homes', 'fight', 'mighty', 'Vikings', 'One', 'night', 'attack', 'dreaded', 'Night', 'Fury', 'dragon', 'so', 'mysterious', 'dangerous', 'one', 'ever', 'even', 'seen', 'one', 'up', 'Hiccup', 'effort', 'prove', 'will', 'capture', 'kill', 'Night', 'Fury', 'thus', 'earning', 'father', 'respect', 'admiration', 'town', 'heart', 'cute', 'little', 'blond', 'Astrid', 'had', 'eyes', 'village', 'occupied', 'dragons', 'Hiccup', 'away', 'plan', 'things', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'mentioned', 'really', 'animated', 'films', 'seem', 'pack', 'more', 'punch', 'many', 'live-action', 'movies', 'Mayhap', 'feel', 'little', 'safer', 'when', 'dealing', 'imaginary', 'situations', 'Maybe', 'see', 'children', 'movies', 'let', 'guard', 'down', 'Whatever', 'case', 'many', 'computer-animated', 'films', 'deal', 'heavy', 'issues', 'see', 'Up', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'was', 'different', 'dealing', 'daddy', 'issues', 'self-confidence', 'moral', 'objection', 'societal', 'views', 'name', 'few', 'movies', 'often', 'have', 'feel', 'good', 'happy', 'endings', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cheated', 'mislead', 'when', 'see', 'No', 'cheer', 'lives', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'problems', 'can', 'see', 'achievement', 'accomplishment', 'someone', 'else', 'even', 'someone', 'computer-animated', 'Hiccup', 'then', 'can', 'find', 'meaning', 'apply', 'life', 'well.This', 'movie', 'different', 'other', 'CGI', 'films', 'too', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'more', 'comedy', 'Shrek', 'thrown', 'adventure', 'instead', 'was', 'other', 'way', 'worldbuilding', 'massive', 'creative', 'filled', 'possibilities', 'adventure', 'hero', 'one', 'movie', 'succeed', 'delivering', 'funny', 'jokes/scenes', 'honestly', 'was', 'more', 'excited', 'plot.My', 'favorite', 'thing', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'definitely', 'dragons', 'What', 'reader', 'can', 'resist', 'dragons', 'when', ""'re"", 'done', 'right', 'writers', 'have', 'imagined', 'many', 'different', 'kinds', 'dragons', 'are', 'small', 'dorky', 'looking', 'are', 'fierce', 'monsters', 'as', 'large', 'building', 'have', 'thick', 'scales', 'have', 'multiple', 'heads', 'were', 'visually', 'stunning', 'beautiful', 'Yes', 'are', 'plenty', 'dragons', 'movie', 'favorite', 'was', 'definitely', 'Night', 'Fury', 'dragon', 'reminded', 'pet', 'dog', 'Stella', 'mannerisms', 'actions', 'were', 'identical', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'Night', 'Fury', 'addition', 'relationship', 'dragon', 'Hiccup', 'was', 'endearing', 'heartfelt', 'harkening', 'up', 'familiar', 'feelings', 'anyone', 'ever', 'owned', 'loved', 'pet.Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'watched', '3D', 'had', '8-yr-old', 'brother-in-law', 'was', 'impressive', 'plain-ole', '2D', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'sufficed', 'DreamWorks', 'failed', 'movies', 'past', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', ""n't"", 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'be', 'thrilled', 'entertained', 'was', 'worth', 'full-price', 'movie', 'ticket', 'weeknight', 'saying', 'something']",N/A

As part of Viking culture he must kill a dragon to prove he has warrior qualities and will be able to succeed his hero father in the Viking kingdom.

The story shows how the kingdom has dragons of every ilk and many of them to boot!  It keeps you interested as the tide of opinion turns and a fantastic ending.

From the first moments of the film it is simply impossible to not like, at least a little, a young boy named Hiccup the Useless (a.k.a Hiccup the Horrendous), son of Stoic the Vast, of the tribe of Hairy Hooligans, from the land of Berk...))) Living amongst possibly the proudest and fiercest tribe of all the Vikings, Hiccup has problems to fit in, as he has less muscles and natural born ferocity than his kinsmen.Having suffered from social isolation for most of his life, he developped a very sarcastic and bitter sense of humour, a solid complex of inferiority and a taste for staying away from others, in the safe haven of the workshop of the blacksmith Gobber, of whom he is the only apprentice.It would be however difficult to see him as a loser, as he spend most of his time since early childhood working very hard and also intensely studying - which made him into the chief tinkerer of the whole Viking village and a very promising future blacksmith. However, his love for extravagant contraptions put him in a lot of trouble many times and many Vikings of Berk consider him almost as a threat to the public safety...)))Now, the Vikings of Berk are tough customers, because since 300 years they wage a desperate war against the local dragons. The land of Berk is poor in natural resources and dragons try daily to steal every scrap of food they can find in Viking village - sheep, fish and even chicken are stolen at the first opportunity. Unwilling to starve, the Vikings developped weapons and tactics to fight the various dragons and until now managed to survive. But the fight is getting tougher and tougher and when the story begins the food supplies are running exceptionally low - and the long and cruel winter will be coming soon... In such hard times everybody is needed to fight to the best of his abilities and Hiccup is send finally into military training together with other youths of his age: Fishlegs, Snotlout, twins Tuffnut and Ruffnut and especially Astrid, the girl with whom he is hopelessly in love like since always - and who despises him openly and comes even to hate him passionately...Now, Hiccup, although being weaker and less bloodthirsty than other Vikings, is definitely not a peacenik. He certainly likes tinkering - but what he builds are war engines! He is also all in favour of waging the war - but as the story develops he will realise that it is crucial that his tribe starts waging the RIGHT KIND of war... And ultimately it will become clear that far from being a loser, he is in fact the greatest warrior of his tribe as he will face, defeat and slay the most powerful, terrifying and evil creature that his tribe has ever met! And there are some moments in the story, in which he displays a steel strong determination and he even can be a little bit ruthless... Combined with wits, humour, honor, courage and generous heart, all this makes him a very likeable and exceptionnal hero of a movie for kids... Small wonder that he finally manages to tame the (lovely and clever) shrew whom he loved from the first sight when they were both barely out of their diapers...2. The First Contact with an alien intelligence. Of all the dragons the Vikings of Berk ever faced, there is one, which even the most ferocious warriors fear - the Night Fury! Nobody ever saw the Night Fury and lived to tell the tale, so even after 300 years of war, nobody has any idea how this dragon looks like... But it exists, that much is certain and it is an absolutely deadly creature. The Night Fury is so fast, that it is impossible to see it clearly in the night sky (it comes out of its secret lair only after sunset) and it creates supersonic blasts when it accelerates! Also, its flame blast is exceptionally powerful - so hot, that it is white-blue and so fast, that it hits the target before even people on the ground realise that they are being shot at. And the Night Fury is also more clever than other dragons, always avoiding traps and always attacking in the weak spots of Viking defences. In one word, Night Fury is death.But because of his intelligence and courage (and also a little bit of luck) Hiccup will manage to see this particular dragon - and even better than just see... During the film the teenager and the deadly but intelligent alien creature will establish a truce, then an understanding, then an alliance - and finally a very deep and sincere friendship. This gradual process is shown with a breathtking perfection, a great intelligence and attention to details and tons of humour - and it is very, very touching...3. The PERFECT first date. I will not enter into details here, because it is important that you discover this great moment of cinema unspoiled, but this is one of the most beautiful scenes I saw in a film ever. I am now a married man and a father of two children (so not really a teenager anymore) but the PERFECT first date from this film very pleasantly reminded me of this time in life when the world seems to smile to us, when the sky is singing, when nothing else counts that this magic moment and when everything is good, pure, beautiful and exactly as it should be... Allow yourself to open your heart beginning with the scene in which Astrid beats Hiccup with her fists and the handle of her battleaxe (definitely a required thing for the PERFECT first date) and let yourself be seduced by the magic of everything that follows. Believe me, you will not regret it...4. The perfection of the scenario. The film makes a full circle and the ending of the story connects perfectly with its beginning (including a very clever use of words ""pest"" and ""pet""). There is not even one moment of weakness. There is absolutely no one scene which could be deleted without harming the film and I can hardly imagine what else could have been added. The dialogues are simply perfect - full of wit and humour, they all have their importance. All characters are very well developped - other than Hiccup, Astrid and the Night Fury, those who are the most crucial are Stoic the Vast and Gobber. A good thing is that the film doesn't bash any characters - there is no ""bad guys"" amongst the Vikings and even when Stoic the Vast makes a huge mistake of judgment we can actually very well understand his reasons - and also there is no doubt that although pigheaded and very conservative, he is nevertheless a very brave and absolutely selfless man, entirely dedicated to the survival of his tribe. A very succesful character is Fishlegs, a somehow obese young Viking who clearly played too much ""Dungeons and Dragons"", as he knows all the dragon statistics by heart... As a long time ADD player myself I laughed out loud during all his nerdy comments and interventions...)))The story gets quite serious towards the end, by showing that the real evil (with capital E, V, I, L and an exclamation mark) can not be ignored, escaped or appeased - it must be faced, fought, defeated and mercilessly eraditcated. But when there is a fight there are casualties on both sides and there is no blodless victories - and so even the greatest triumph brings its part of grief, loss and sorrow. The great thing about ""How to train your dragon"" is that although there is a happy ending, it is not precisely an eezy peezy pink candy sweet kind of happy ending - it is a surprisingly serious happy ending in which relief, happiness and cheerfulness are mixed with just a tiny little bit of sadness (not enough to make little kids cry though).Bottom line, this film is a treasure and a pleasure. If you didn't see it, go get it. It will make you laugh a lot, cheer you up no matter how bad was your day. And the PERFECT first date scene will mend many wounds that time unavoidably inflicted to your heart (as it did to all of us) and certainly make you smile with just the right kind of nostalgy (if you are a fully grown up adult) ot just the right kind of expectation (if you are still in your early teens). ENJOY!",5,"A boy and his dragon, or how to befriend an alien intelligent creature, live the PERFECT first date and end a 300 years old war",1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,8685,"['film', 'masterpiece',

The storyline was great but I subtracted a star for the less then stellar 3D effects.  Technically, it met the requirements as it added depth to the movie but it lacked the gotcha factor of having something coming right out at you.  It has flying dragons people!  The 3D felt like it was added as an afterthought.As for the movie itself, sit back and enjoy this tale of a thin young viking boy, Hiccup, who just doesn't fit in and it doesn't help that his father is the ruler of this Viking village.  It starts out with the villagers fighting off dragon attacks.  Hiccup has come up with a contraption to that shoots ropes and rocks to tangle dragons up and is determined to try it out on the deadliest dragon of all - the Night Fury.  To his surprise it works and he manages to capture a dragon but cannot find it in himself to kill the beast; instead, he finds a friend.  One who teaches him valuable lessons about dragons and himself.  Suddenly, the least likely to succeed ends up being the winner at Dragon Training School.  Having Astrid, a girl that Hiccup liked, becoming a side kick made for a few ""eewwws"" when she pecked Hiccup on the cheek but that's about it.Hiccup tries to show his fellow Vikings that dragons are not the enemy and that there are bigger meaner beasts to fight.  He is not successful and his beloved dragon ends up being captured by the Vikings. Hiccup does his best to help his dragon friend with the help of other friends from Dragon School.At the heart of this story is the question - are dragons good or bad?  We learn that some dragons are good and some are bad, just like everything else.  More important is the lesson that one should never prejudge.  This is proven when Hiccup is judged to be less ""Viking"" by his father and yet it is Hiccup who ends up determining their fate and not the strong leader.As a parent, I enjoyed this movie and I know my kids did too.  The movie flew by at 98 minutes.  This movie is based on the popular book series with the same name.

There is not I can say that hasn't been said by others. I especially like the idea of a isolated colony of Vikings on a remote island where they set up their own community and traditions. The idea of the nerdy screw up outcast becoming a hero is a cliche done too often, but the idea of a dragon being a pet and a workhorse for the settlement is interesting. The whole settlement learns better and not to fear and hunt dragons, but to use as pets and transportation. I especially enjoyed the character of Astrid as a brave warrior-to-be, who first is contemptuous of Hiccup, but after some time grows to love him. Also her outfit, including the belt of skulls hints at a fierceness within her that is appealing. No passive women in this film. This heroic fantasy film creates a new breakthrough in high quality animation and a strong story that is enchanting, exciting, and rewarding. The setting of the film is also very interesting and different from other films. I also note that the dragon Hiccup captures is given cats' eyes, in fact the dragon seems to me to be a playful flying cat that resembles a reptile in appearance.

I suggest you watch it, all three short movies, and the entire TV show before you see the second movie on June 20, 2014. It is so worth.Plot:The plot is fantastic. It never gets dry; it never gets boring. I've watched it three nights in a row. They drop a couple of one-liners that really make me happy. (i.e. &#34;First to ride one though.&#34;) I love how the adults all have Scottish accents and the kids don't. They symbolization is uncanny.Casting:Whereas Jay Baruchel's voice is perfect for the main protagonist, I could help but notice that it did not quite fit Hiccup's demeanor. I don't think they should have recasted Baruchel, but possibly redesigned Hiccup? That being said, the cast was fantastic, perfect even. There were a couple that were much better than expected. America Ferrera played the blonde-haired, feisty heartthrob very well; I did not expect this because she is the opposite. (Not that she's ugly, but she's not, looks or personality, anything like Astrid.) Jonah Hill had my favorite line of the movie. He was hilarious! And getting Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson was genius. The only two famous Scots in America being in this movie was really the only thing they could have done.So if you're wondering if you should buy this movie, do it.  I promise you will not regret it.

This is a thoroughly charming tale of a boy and his dragon in a society that (to say the least) doesn't exactly like dragons.  Unlike so many animated films, it never dumbs down the story to reach a wider audience, it doesn't have hip pop culture references, it doesn't have poop jokes, and in general, it treats you like an adult while still being great for children.  The story is engaging and frequently moving (I found myself wiping away tears more than once), and the arc of the story, while not profoundly original, is very well handled.  Visually, the movie is absolutely gorgeous, with rich and vibrant colors that will take your breath away.  The movie is perfectly cast, and the characters are interesting and intelligent.  I have to particularly single out Jay Baruchel as Hiccup; his sardonic, self-deprecating wit really breathes life into his character.  The 3-D animation is absolutely fantastic; the dragon-riding scenes are just as exciting as similar scenes in Avatar.  As an ex-skydiver myself, these reminded me a lot of my own experiences in the air; the scene where Hiccup is falling from a great height astounded me, as he positions his body in a perfect skydiver's arch to give himself maximum control!I've left the best for last.  This movie is full of great messages that are worth teaching to any child (and worth relearning if you've forgotten them as an adult), and this gives the movie an emotional core that sets it apart from other animated movies.  These messages include: kindness to animals, looking behind surface appearances for deeper truths, not blindly trusting authority, and being yourself even if it means you will be rejected by your peers.  We've seen all of these messages before in other films, but they are so integral to this movie and are so well integrated with the story that they give the film real depth.  I can't wait until my son is old enough for me to watch this movie with him!",5,My favorite animated movie.

For me, their appeal has always been in their comedy. The few more serious movies of that style usually bored me and I couldn't really get into them. But the title of this one was, naturally, appealing to a fantasy lover such as as myself. I had kept the movie in the back of my mind and finally saw it not too long ago when a friend of mine recommended it.What a cute and lovely film! The story is so sweet and in a lot of ways, pretty original. If you're anything like me, you were probably expecting some sort of ""Eragon"" rip-off (which would be kind of strange as ""Eragon"" itself could be considered a rip-off anyway). But that isn't the case. The story is not one of a revival of ancient magic or of defeating an ancient enemy to return to the old way of doing things - there is no magic other than the existence of dragons (which I suppose could be considered magical in some ways), and until Hiccup and Toothless a human's friendship with a dragon is a completely unheard-of thing in Berk. The focus of the story isn't on some great enemy that must be defeated, but on the main character's journey to discover himself and find acceptance as he is.Another unique aspect is the way the dragons were designed; none of them look even remotely like most people imagine or depict dragons at all, and each species was very different from the others. I enjoyed that. It's fun to see something different. All of the animation was great, some of it even a bit jaw-dropping for me because of how real it looked.The score is epic and beautiful, with a celtic sound to it. The acting is also great, and despite having a more serious plot, there are actually a lot of funny moments in the film.I don't dislike every Disney film, but the more animated movies I watch from other companies, the more I realize how much Disney's usually fall short.

The animation is very high in detail, especially in IMAX 3-D, and the characters are not only likeable, but memorable. The main dragon, Toothless, is one of the greatest animated characters in a long time, and like Wall-E, he doesn't even talk. All of the other species of dragons also have unique looks and personalities. The flying sequences here really show the power of 3-D as a tool to put the viewer in the movie, not just a gimmick. I would say it's second only to Avatar when viewed through those funny looking glasses.This film is more serious in tone than laugh out loud funny, much like the latest from Pixar (UP, Wall-E, etc.), but it does have quite a few laughs that come naturally, not forced. I'm so glad they stayed away from pop culture references. Both kids and parents will love How to Train Your Dragon equally and probably for much different reasons. The only thing that I didn't care for were the first 10 minutes or so. Not that they are bad in any way, but it felt a little rushed. Once the film settles and Hiccup (the boy viking) meets the dragon, everything begins to click. The only other negative is that every kid is going to want a pet dragon for their birthday.

Unfortunately none of those traits are in demand among the Vikings ... and, as it turns out, he's a young Viking.  They pride themselves on brawn, rather than brain.  They value the ruthless and courageous, the dragon killers, rather than the clever and kind and empathetic.  Of course, since he's the star of the movie, we know he's going to show that what he has is what they need, and that he'll save his village and prove himself to his father along the way.  It's the same tried and true formula that has formed the emotional core of so many animated films, about an out-of-place young person who proves himself to his people and his parent(s) by being completely different from them and doing just what they would never do.  It's what madeRudolph'snose bright, what made Remy's nose sensitive (inRatatouille), and what made Flik so clever (inA Bug's Life).  What keeps folks following the formula is that it works.  We all root for the under-appreciated underdog, because, at bottom, we all think we are one, but what we really want for the outsider is that he or she (and we) be accepted by the insiders.  The formula, though, feels fresh enough here to work quite well.With this film andKung Fu Panda, it seems the Dreamworks folks have finally learned that the the easy laughs that come with the endless pop cultural references (of shows likeShark Tale) just make a movie seem stale on a second or third viewing.  While that one was amusing enough the first time in theaters, by the time it came out on dvd it just felt lame.  Kung Fu Panda, though, feels fresh after a few viewings, and I'm certain this one will too.  The range of personalities among the Vikings makes them all consistently interesting, the dragons, especially in flight, are delightfully rendered; there are moments of awe and there are slow moments where you can really connect with the characters.  While I wouldn't consider this a flawless film - the final showdown and the final revelations about the dragons that came with it seemed a bit too easy and contrived - it is nevertheless a beautifully animated and very enjoyable film.

Previous releases include Beowulf, Pathfinder, The 13th Warrior among others.  All these previous movies shared one result; bad reviews.  Now Dreamworks takes a stab at the genre with an animated comedy, and scores one of the biggest hits of 2010; How to Train Your Dragon.  Unlike Shrek, Over the Hedge, Antz and Dreamwork's previous animated films, this one focuses primarily on human characters and their relationships, with only one key non-human involved, the dragon Toothless.  And interestingly, Toothless does not talk, which is rare in animated films.  Yet the combination works out.  The movie is funny, the storyline is extremely original, and the characters have depth and create empathy among the audience.  Most of the comedy is either slapstick action comedy involving the dragons, or humorous dialogue between the viking characters; all of which is appropriate for even the youngest children.I consider this one of the best movies of 2010.  This would have been the best animated film of 2010 if Toy Story 3 was not around.  But since both films came out this year, we might see 2 animated nominations for the Best Picture at the Academy Awards come February.  Both the Blu-Ray and regular DVD come with an additional short film featuring most of the main, human characters from the main movie.  This short film is quite entertaining, though it is pure comedy and lacks some of the heart of the feature film.  There are no additional scenes in the movie, just the standard features that come with a DVD, such as interviews with cast members, and a history of the effort it took to go from book to film.

1304586,AHF97M45JFCB,B002ZG97YM,ONENEO,"[3, 3]","With a review title as ambitious as mine, some justification is definitely in order.  See unlike Pixar (with a little help of the Disney promotion machine), animated hits with the potential to become pop culture icons aren't a given for DreamWorks.  Sure they've had Shrek but ask anyone and you'll discover that 4 feature films and a variety of spin-offs have milked the franchise past its worth.  Kung-Fu Panda came next with signs of brilliance.  Proponents however were quick to point out the fact that marital-arts references simply aren't universal enough (however hilarious) to challenge the clever-ness of your average Pixar piece.Enter How to Train Your Dragon, a 2010 animated work based loosely on a 2003 children's book by Cressida Cowell of the same name.  Coming in at a runtime of 98-minutes, Dragon gained enough critical acclaim to warrant a video game series, a sequel planned for release sometime in the summer of 2013, a Cartoon Network animated weekly series beginning in 2012, plans for a live-tour, and the Blu-ray earning a spot in Samsung's Home 3D Starter Kit.I was vaguely aware of the hype surrounding this one going in, and even so came away absolutely dazzled with the end result.  But before digging into what it is that makes this motion picture a crowning achievement, let's assemble a small summary of the plot, shall we?The story takes place in a mythical Norse world called Berk and follows the exploits of a skinny Viking teenager named Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel).  Residing in a land torn by constant threat of brutal dragon invasion, Hiccup finds himself struggling to gain the approval of his gruff father Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler).Insisting on entering into battle (to prove his valor), Hiccup ends up using one of his inventions to take down a mysterious and highly feared Night Fury class dragon but is seen by the villagers as only the cause of unnecessary destruction.The next day, after tracking his fallen prey, Hiccup is faced with the fact that he can't bring himself to kill the beast (and hence instantly gain the respect he wants most out of life).Instead, Hiccup and the black dragon, whom, thanks to retractable teeth he dubs Toothless, forge a friendship that leads to his discovering that humans have misjudged the entire species.Further complicating the relationship is the fact that Hiccup finds himself enrolled in Dragon Training; a gamut of human versus captive dragon barbarism that ends with one of the students having to slay a dragon before the blood-hungry town.It turns out that in Berk, just like in reality, a better understanding of one's enemy can often prove more impactual than centuries of doing battle with them.So if right now you're thinking this all sounds cute and clich&eacute;, rest assured that there is charm in this one no summary will be able to capture accurately.  The direction and pacing are absolutely spot-on here, so much so in fact that it often becomes difficult to even remember that this is an animated film (often considered the ultimate compliment to any animator).The characters and corresponding cast is marvelous with enough passion and range to keep the viewer's attention precisely where it should be (on the story).Visuals, as one might expect on a film that cost an estimated $165 million, are stunning- especially the fire effects and flight sequences (that look amazing on the home screen in hi-def even without the much ballyhooed 3D).Additionally noteworthy is the fact that overly expressive animal eyes and the development of the bond between Hiccup and Toothless is conveyed here virtually without dialogue, which suggests that DreamWorks has been paying close attention to Pixar's mastery of the medium.John Powell's score adds to the delicious flavor with its heart-thumping tension on down to heart wrenching intimateness and everything in between.In all, even a film as hyped as this one can stand to have a bit more praise heaped upon it simply because it delivers in just about every conceivable level.  Truly the business-model driven DreamWorks has its masterpiece that even the nerd-farm that is Pixar need be envious of.

1304606,A8G9GETA2OLMZ,B002ZG97YM,P. Schumacher,"[3, 7]","I wanted to like this movie.And it does have engaging things.The Night Fury dragon, Toothless, that Hiccup adopts is cute and likable.  In the commentary, the animators talk a long time about how hard they had to work to fashion a cute, yet still scary, face.One look at ""Stitch"" from ""Lilo and Stitch"" will show that they needn't have worked so hard.  They could have stolen Stitch's (maybe they did).Likewise, the moral is engaging: better to understand and befriend than demonize and kill.Also, Astrid is cute, and the love-story is humorously un-romantic.But still, I had a hard time liking it.One reason was Jay Baruchel's voice for Hiccup.  In the commentary, Baruchel becomes effusive with what a super, great, life-changing and world-changing movie this was.  But it isn't.  I can't tell if Baruchel actually believes this, or is just protesting too much.  Baruchel gets the ""Christian-Slater-Talk-Alike"" award, but his whinyness gets old fast.Another reason is the static appearance of Stoick, Hiccup's father.  Yes, he is mildly engaging, but only mildly.  The animators talk at length about what a breakthrough he is, but his braided beard and furry coat look merely painted on, and his body moves like a robot.The dragons are uniformly cute and interesting, but the human characters are uniformly monotonous.Despite the raves of all the people who worked on the movie (in the commentary), really it is nothing special to look at.

1304608,AQR22MPF45M3P,B002ZG97YM,Rachel Ford,"[1, 1]","I first heard about this film from my coworkers with kids, who were really surprised at how much they liked the movie when they took their kids. I ended up seeing it because my sister, who works in child care, tries to watch all the popular kids movies so she knows what the kids are talking about when they talk about them. She rented the dvd one evening and, since I was pretty bored, I started watching it.The introduction had me hooked (growing up in Wisconsin, Hiccup's description of the Island of Burke sounded like ""Home Sweet Home""), and, five minutes in, I knew I loved the movie. That was before we even saw Toothless.The story (mild spoilers) follows Hiccup, a young, nerdy Viking as he proves himself to his fellow Vikings -- and the Dragons. The outline of the story really sounds like it could be just about any other teen story out there, but this movie stands heads-and-shoulders above the rest for a combination of reasons. First of all, the characters are great. Hiccup is not just your average annoying, whiny teen-goof-who-must-prove-himself (or, worse, an annoying, whiny teen-nongoof-who-fancies-him/herself-a-goof-who-must-prove-him/herself, ala Bella from Twilight). Instead of whining or denying his shortcomings, he tries to combat them. Ok, so he can't lift heavy hammers or pop off a dragon's head with his hands...but he eagerly runs into battle with his ""cannon"" to shoot what he can't. No one believes that he took down a dragon; does he throw a temper tantrum or sulk for hours? No, he tries to find the dragon and bring back proof. He's harder on himself than he should be (like, considering himself a coward because he won't kill a defenseless, bound animal), but he's judging himself by his community's standards; and he acknowledges his shortcomings and tries to figure out how to go on despite them. A character that could have come out very cliche, but didn't.Toothless is...hilarious! The animators * had * to know animals, because they made the actions and expressions of this dragon so believable it's uncanny! He had a very likable ""personality"" (Dragon-ality?), and was a perfect ""pet"". The scenes where Hiccup and Toothless get to know each other are incredible...there was so much potential for this to end up cheesy or otherwise to go wrong, but it was all great stuff. Toothless is my favorite character in the whole movie, but I love Hiccup too (followed by the twins).Astrid, Rough and Tough, Fishlegs, Snotlout (?), Stoic, Gobber, etc. were also fantastic. They all had their own personalities -- and, again, so much potential to go wrong if done wrong...but were instead great -- and part to play in the story.The voice acting was superb. Hiccup's voice was outrageously good...the twins were absolutely convincing nerds and troublemakers...Astrid was strong but not obnoxious...etc., etc. The voice actors really were crucial here...any of the lines that are hilarious in this film could have been awful if the wrong voice actor attempted them.The animation was great as well. Watching the final fight scene, I found myself thinking, ""Wow, that would be an EPIC battle to witness."" And the animators got ""body language"" down quite well...like the ""now we finally have something to talk about"" scene. You could feel Stoic's anticipation for the good stories his boy would share.Another thing I loved about this movie was that, despite the fact that the story was, in essence, a ""lesson"" story (the Vikings and dragons had misunderstood one another, and ended up ""BFF""; the nerdy kid ended up a hero -- and disabled as well [a nice tribute, I think, particularly when we have wounded veterans coming home every day]), it wasn't ""preachy"" at all. So, kids could take good lessons from the story, but it wasn't a ""teaching"" movie.And, as an adult, I loved it. It's one of the best movies to come out in a long time, IMHO. I don't have kids, but I bought this movie anyway. :P",5,"Hillarious, well-executed, and a lot of fun...a new favorite film",1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,3924,"['first', 'heard', 'film', 'coworkers', 'kids', 'who', 'were', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'movie', 'when', 'took', 'kids', 'ended', 'up', 'seeing', 'sister', 'who', 'child', 'care', 'tries', 'watch', 'popular', 'kids', 'movies', 'what', 'kids', 'are', 'talking', 'when', 'talk', 'rented', 'dvd', 'one', 'evening', 'was', 'pretty', 'bored', 'started', 'watching', 'it.The', 'introduction', 'had', 'hooked', 'growing', 'up', 'Wisconsin', 'Hiccup', 'description', 'Island', 'Burke', 'sounded', 'Home', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'five', 'minutes', 'knew', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'saw', 'Toothless.The', 'story', 'mild', 'spoilers', 'Hiccup', 'young', 'nerdy', 'Viking', 'fellow', 'Vikings', 'Dragons', 'outline', 'story', 'really', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'other', 'teen', 'story', 'there', 'movie', 'heads-and-shoulders', 'rest', 'combination', 'reasons', 'First', 'all', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'Hiccup', 'not', 'just', 'average', 'annoying', 'whiny', 'teen-goof-who-must-prove-himself', 'worse', 'annoying', 'whiny', 'teen-nongoof-who-fancies-him/herself-a-goof-who-must-prove-him/herself', 'ala', 'Bella', 'Twilight', 'Instead', 'whining', 'denying', 'shortcomings', 'combat', 'Ok', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lift', 'heavy', 'hammers', 'pop', 'off', 'dragon', 'head', 'hands', 'eagerly', 'battle', 'cannon', 'shoot', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'No', 'one', 'took', 'down', 'dragon', 'throw', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'sulk', 'hours', 'No', 'find', 'dragon', 'bring', 'back', 'proof', 'harder', 'should', 'be', 'considering', 'coward', 'wo', ""n't"", 'kill', 'defenseless', 'animal', 'judging', 'community', 'standards', 'shortcomings', 'tries', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'go', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'very', 'cliche', ""didn't.Toothless"", 'hilarious', 'animators', '*', 'had', '*', 'know', 'animals', 'made', 'actions', 'expressions', 'dragon', 'so', 'believable', 'uncanny', 'had', 'very', 'likable', 'personality', 'Dragon-ality', 'was', 'perfect', 'pet', 'scenes', 'where', 'Hiccup', 'Toothless', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'are', 'incredible', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'end', 'up', 'cheesy', 'otherwise', 'go', 'wrong', 'was', 'great', 'stuff', 'Toothless', 'favorite', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'love', 'Hiccup', 'too', 'followed', 'twins', '.Astrid', 'Rough', 'Tough', 'Fishlegs', 'Snotlout', 'Stoic', 'Gobber', 'etc', 'were', 'also', 'fantastic', 'had', 'own', 'personalities', 'again', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'go', 'wrong', 'done', 'wrong', 'were', 'instead', 'great', 'part', 'play', 'story.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'Hiccup', 'voice', 'was', 'outrageously', 'good', 'twins', 'were', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'nerds', 'troublemakers', 'Astrid', 'was', 'strong', 'not', 'obnoxious', 'etc.', 'etc', 'voice', 'actors', 'really', 'were', 'crucial', 'here', 'lines', 'are', 'hilarious', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'awful', 'wrong', 'voice', 'actor', 'attempted', 'them.The', 'animation', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'Watching', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'found', 'thinking', 'Wow', 'would', 'be', 'EPIC', 'battle', 'witness', 'animators', 'got', 'body', 'language', 'down', 'quite', 'well', 'now', 'finally', 'have', 'something', 'talk', 'scene', 'could', 'feel', 'Stoic', 'anticipation', 'good', 'stories', 'boy', 'would', 'share.Another', 'thing', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'fact', 'story', 'was', 'essence', 'lesson', 'story', 'Vikings', 'dragons', 'had', 'misunderstood', 'one', 'ended', 'up', 'BFF', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'ended', 'up', 'hero', 'disabled', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'tribute', 'think', 'particularly', 'when', 'have', 'wounded', 'veterans', 'coming', 'home', 'day', ']', 'was', ""n't"", 'preachy', 'So', 'kids', 'could', 'take', 'good', 'lessons', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'teaching', 'movie.And', 'adult', 'loved', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'long', 'time', 'IMHO', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'bought', 'movie', 'anyway', 'P']",N/A

Afterwards he discovers the Dragon stuck in a canyon unable to escape after being injured. He then befriends the Dragon slowly and discovers the battle the Vikings have with the Dragons for years is not what it appears to be. The Dragon is terriably adorable, makes me want to have him at home :) They do a great job with giving him lovable personality you would not expect from a Dragon.

In the small island of Berk, a scrawny but inventive teenage Viking named Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) hopes of earning the respect of his father (Gerard Butler) and the rest of the village by slaying his first dragon, but when he stumbles upon a frightened and injured beast, he can't bring himself to kill it. Hiccup defies centuries of tradition by befriending the dragon he calls Toothless and learns that he must convince his village the errors of their ways. ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is an interesting and utterly charming family spectacle from the creators of ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"". Though the story is pretty straightforward, the animated film is a heartfelt mix of adventure and comedy. The characters are amusing and well developed. The computer animation is certainly stunning.

Thankfully, the brilliant animation, characters, and a pleasant variation on the traditional &#8220;a boy and his dog&#8221; plot keep that attention.HTTYD quickly brings you in with its main character, Hiccup, voiced by Jay Baruchel. He is a nerd/outcast archetype, something Baruchel seems to have found himself typecast as, but there is something of a sincerity to his voice and identifiability to his problem of not living up his father&#8217;s expectations. These are things that we&#8217;ve all seem before, but they are still welcome here because there is a genuineness to the performances in this film. Hiccup has a great sarcastic sense of humor, and the other teen characters help give the film authenticity, in spite of all the flying fire-breathing reptiles. There&#8217;s Astrid (America Ferrera), Snoutlout (Jonah Hill), Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), twins Ruffnut (Kristin Wiig) and Tuffnut (T.J. Miller). The bit of the Appatow gang that&#8217;s present here lend their improv skills to some the humorous conversations, and it works to the film&#8217;s benefit. Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson also work great as the village chief and Hiccup&#8217;s dad Stoick and blacksmith Gobber respectively.Where this film really shines, other than the characters, are the visuals. The seas and skies are painted wonderfully. This is especially evident in the scenes where the characters are riding the dragons as mounts. The filmmakers knew that this would be the highpoint in the film, and special care was taken to beautifully and artfully depict the sensation of flight, as well as the creatures&#8217; agility and speed.The plot can follow some predictable turns, as the archetype here is &#8220;a boy and his dog&#8221; but the twist that keeps this film going the fact this is a pretty cool dog. A dragon. And yes, the little boy in me screams &#8220;awesome!&#8221; at riding a dragon. It really is something that simple that drives this film, how awesome it would be to have a dragon as a pet. What propels this film to being great is the seriousness of the conflicts and the identifiable characters. A great one from DreamWorks, whose reputation is slowly approaching Pixar-like proportions.

Zwick,"[0, 0]","****1/2In this day and age when quality animated features are the rule rather than the exception, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" still manages to beat all comers with its charm, imagination and honest sentiment.Based on the story by Cressida Cowell, the movie focuses on Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III (Jay Baruchel), the scrawny young son of a Viking leader (Gerard Butler) who worries that his boy may not possess the mettle a true Viking warrior must have to smite the many dragons that periodically swoop in on the village to steal its food.  It's not that Hiccup doesn't WANT to be a dragon-slayer; heck, he's even enrolled in a dragon-slaying course replete with real dragons for the students to practice their moves on.  No, the problem is that Hiccup has met and made friends with an injured dragon in the wild (a beast he calls Toothless) and the lad soon discovers that dragons are not the natural-born enemies to Man that he and the other Vikings thought they were.Beyond its glorious visuals, eye-popping action sequences, and terrific voiceover work, ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" written and directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, emerges as a surprisingly compelling human tale of a boy who wants desperately to live up to the high standards his demanding father has set for him, but who just can't betray his new-found best friend in order to do so.  Without getting sappy about it, the movie provides fine moral lessons for the youngsters - though, one should point out that the intensity of the action scenes may prove a tad disturbing for the very littlest in the audience.  Its soaring flight scenes are some of the best we've ever encountered in an animated movie, and its canny combination of humor, adventure and sentiment catapult it to the head of the class among recent animated films (along with ""Toy Story 3,"" that is).",4,Superb on every level,1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,1845,"['****1/2In', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'quality', 'animated', 'features', 'are', 'rule', 'rather', 'exception', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'still', 'beat', 'comers', 'charm', 'imagination', 'honest', 'sentiment.Based', 'story', 'Cressida', 'Cowell', 'movie', 'Hiccup', 'Horrendous', 'Haddock', 'III', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'scrawny', 'young', 'son', 'Viking', 'leader', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'who', 'boy', 'may', 'not', 'possess', 'mettle', 'true', 'Viking', 'warrior', 'must', 'have', 'smite', 'many', 'dragons', 'periodically', 'swoop', 'village', 'steal', 'food', 'not', 'Hiccup', ""n't"", 'WANT', 'be', 'dragon-slayer', 'heck', 'even', 'enrolled', 'dragon-slaying', 'course', 'replete', 'real', 'dragons', 'students', 'practice', 'moves', 'No', 'problem', 'Hiccup', 'met', 'made', 'friends', 'injured', 'dragon', 'wild', 'beast', 'Toothless', 'lad', 'soon', 'discovers', 'dragons', 'are', 'not', 'natural-born', 'enemies', 'Man', 'other', 'Vikings', 'thought', 'were.Beyond', 'glorious', 'visuals', 'eye-popping', 'action', 'sequences', 'terrific', 'voiceover', 'work', 'How', 'Train', 'Your', 'Dragon', 'written', 'directed', 'Dean', 'DeBlois', 'Chris', 'Sanders', 'surprisingly', 'compelling', 'human', 'tale', 'boy', 'who', 'desperately', 'live', 'up', 'high', 'standards', 'demanding', 'father', 'set', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'betray', 'new-found', 'best', 'friend', 'order', 'do', 'so', 'getting', 'sappy', 'movie', 'fine', 'moral', 'lessons', 'youngsters', 'one', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'intensity', 'action', 'scenes', 'may', 'prove', 'tad', 'disturbing', 'very', 'littlest', 'audience', 'soaring', 'flight', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'animated', 'movie', 'canny', 'combination', 'humor', 'adventure', 'sentiment', 'catapult', 'head', 'class', 'recent', 'animated', 'films', 'Toy', 'Story', '3']",N/A

Lucado ""I'm the other author named L...","[5, 5]","All year long I've waited for a movie that would be fun to watch, exciting, suitable for families, and have a sense of decency about it.  The wait is over.  ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is solid entertainment that doesn't try to preach to, gross out, or insult the intelligence of the audience.The story involves a young Viking, named Hiccup, who's...well...different.  For whatever reason, he's not into a hack-and-slash approach to defending his village from the marauding dragons that for seven generations have shown up to grab livestock and burn everything in sight.  He's not exactly a super-macho dude, being scrawny of limb but with plenty of intellectual muscle, which he demonstrates by creating clever devices and being sensitive to his surroundings.Combine raiding dragons with an outcast inventor and you get an unexpected encounter between Hiccup and a dreaded ""Night Fury"" dragon, and after this reptilian meet-cute we get a bonding that Anne McCaffrey would approve of.In the meantime, Hiccup has to keep his new friend a secret from his fellow Vikings, who have an ingrained impulse to destroy every dragon on sight.  Well, who can blame them?  Life is tough in the Viking world, and losing your home and livestock to airborne flamethrowers would make you a little belligerent.  But as Hiccup learns, there's more to the story--a lot more.The film has a truly gripping climactic battle that I won't spoil by giving too much detail, but is clearly inspired by a famous science fiction movie from 1977.  Well, original it may not be, but it's terrific, if a little too intense for very young children (a toddler behind me in the theater was howling in terror).Overall, a real pleasure to watch.

This script is brilliant in such a way that most of the reviewers here utterly miss it.  Let me explain.You have a complicated fantasy world, with its own spin on Vikings and all different kinds of dragons.  Each kind of dragon has important strengths and weaknesses that are at times critical to the story.  The movie almost seamlessly gives you a lecture in Dragons 101 and the life of these Vikings, without being irritating or boring.  If you cannot understand the dragon side of the movie, you never should have watched it because you were determined to be bored anyway.  Plus the initial voice-over explaining all of this ties into action, and visuals, that both kick-start the narrative in high gear and mixes it with action sequences that both show what's being explained, and keep it fascinating and funny.  I wish my workplace training videos had 1/10th the effort put into them.The story is fairly basic, but it's been claimed there are only seven main plots in literature (depending on whom you read, of course).  The fun is how you get there.  Yes, you have the outsider kid who is not interested in what all the other kids are into.  He makes good, and becomes the hero.  There's a girl involved too but anything else would be a plot spoiler - however, since you see her in her armor with skull decorations (small) in her first scene, I can safely reveal that she's definitely no shrinking violet. There is the plot line of maybe looking at why the other side is doing what it is doing, and the main character's (named Hiccup) questioning that is what provides for the story and much of the conflict.  Contrary to some other people's spin on it, there is a truly evil nemesis, and no amount of understanding is going to change this bad guy.  Understanding gains allies who had been adversaries, and the chance to win the final conflict.  But final conflict there is, and boy it's a doozy.I wish I'd seen it in 3-D.  We saw it at home on blu-ray, and the video quality and sound-track are superb.  My seven year old daugher has declared it her favorite movie, and both my wife and I, who often take 20 minutes to agree on a movie, both love it and will watch it again.  Instead of trying to be pseudo-realistic the animation revels in being just that, and the movie is the better for it.  I am happy I do not have to vote on best Animated Film this year.

I mean my wife and I we're shocked when the credits rolled and saw that the lead voice of Hiccup was played by Jay, um, uh, Barawho and not Slater. Anyway....How to Train Your Dragon is a great family movie and it came recommended to me by several friends that don't even have kids. Now, I've seen some animated features (likeThe Incredibles) that could potentially make my all time list of favorite movies, but I'd have to think hard about any animated movie that would make it into my top 20 of all time. And of my top 20 favorite movies half would likely only get 4 versus 5 stars. Dragon would land on a separate list somewhere only in about the middle of the pack of just my favorite ""animated"" movies. It's a good movie...but classic? Nah.Against his father's will, the timid Hiccup sneaks out with a new weapon he designed. Turns out the weapon works pretty well and he brings down the most feared dragon in the land with it. The weapon doesn't kill the beast, and as the title of the movie might suggest, Hiccup instead forms a friendship with the monster that could change human/dragon relations forever.I was thoroughly entertained. My wife thought it was okay. My kids...they liked it. No one was wowed. Perhaps I've spoiled my family with my liberal stance of letting them watch pretty much anything they want (within reason). Or maybe we've all just overdosed on reruns of the earlySpongeBob Episodeson DVD. Cuz, I'll tell ya what, if you said to me that Nick is running a marathon of the first 50 SpongeBob episodes or Cartoon Network is premiering How to Train Your Dragon, I'd been tuning into Nick.Toy Storyis a 5 star animated movie.Shrekis a 5 star animated movie. EvenA Bug's Lifeis a 5 star animated movie. How to Train Your Dragon is a really good animated feature that will soon be forgotten by all who watched on my TV set. Don't get me wrong...Dragon is definitely a worthy rental at minimum. It's just not a classic.

1304661,AMGGZCWY3VNZC,B002ZG97YM,S. Morales,"[0, 0]","How To Train Your Dragon is most definitely one of the biggest sleeper hits in recent memory. While the film got great reviews from critics, audiences never really paid it much mind, forgetting it quickly in exchange for more ""toddler"" oriented animated movies, such as Tangled, Rio, or 3D remade family classics such as The Lion King, and Beauty and the Beast. 'Dragon' being a PG animated film tailors towards older kids, but will be just as adored by adults for its epic action and deep and heartfelt characters. So no, this is a not a film made for 3 and 4 year old toddlers who just wanna go and see a cute animals make funny faces. Some dragons can be a bit scary for them, not to also mention the fiery action, so I'd recommend this for at least 6 years and up.The story takes place during the Viking era and stars Hiccup, a small and skinny Viking son of a much bigger, manlier, and grander dragon-slaying father. Hiccup must compete with other kids his age in order to train to be dragon killers, yet this is the classic story of a kid who simply feels different from the others, and figures out a truth about the dragons that no one else knows - that they can live in a good peaceful coexistence. Hiccup stumbles upon a dragon himself, trains with him and soon learns many life lessons using his brain instead of his brawn in order to humble the dragons, in the hopes of proving all the others wrong.The best thing about 'Dragon' is its attention to the characters - there is much time taken to build up the relationship between Hiccup and his black sheep dragon named Toothless. Lots of quiet moments are granted to us making this a very unique film about characters and how relationships grow despite cultural obstacles, really making this a parallel on society in a strange way. This is way different than the usual loud and obnoxious animated family films that rely way too much on impressing the audience with crazy special effects instead of giving them a good story. 'Dragon' does have much action and great effects on its own, but what makes this film work is that the effects are used to guide the story, not tell it. Hence, we get a great character story ALONG WITH all the great epic action to accompany it. 2 for 1, can't go wrong with it. 'Dragon' does not disappoint in all regards; it's definitely apparent the filmmakers put lots of effort into a well-told story as well as good special effects and animation. Moreover, we must understand that this story is not anything we haven't already seen before in a different setting, but the simplicity of the story and its reliance on character actions instead of constant monologues and dialogues granted by movies that simply talk too much and do very little.Some people may be disappointed that the comedy aspect of this film isn't at the forefront. This is more of an action/adventure with some comedic elements simply SPRINKLED upon the film, but the movie is not made to be a comedy. The beauty here is that the story is so good, it doesn't ever matter to the viewer. You'll be too busy ""whoah'ing to ever care to chuckle a cheap 'haha.' So no, 'Dragon' won't pull out any dumb and overused pop culture trendy lines in order to be loved by the latest Entertainment Weekly subscriber a la Shrek, nor will you find any sort of product placement nonsense. The filmmakers are here to give you an epic adventure, and on honing in on this goal it is then done incredibly well, you won't really care about anything else. The story may be simple, but since it's told so fantastically, you appreciate it anyhow.This all leads up to an epic dragon battle finale which contains some of the best special effects editing and shot in recent animated film history, and I would have to say on a personal note that seeing action this intense and well directed is not something you'll probably find in any other family film out there. So if you're tired of just being fed little kiddie stories about cute animals walking around in colorful little worlds, check out 'Dragon' for some more intense action that dares to walk on a slightly grittier terrain. With a story full of dragons, Vikings and epic longships, you will not be disappointed.On a technical side, and this is a pretty big point and one of the main reasons that make the Blu-ray copy of this film so appealing. That the film, in a nutshell, looks ABSOLUTELY IMMACULATE. The detail found on this Blu-ray transfer is simply stunning and jaw-droppingly GORGEOUS to any fan of High Definition video. Landscapes are clean and fully detailed, edges are sharp, colors are extravagant, smoke and light are eye-poppingly smooth, motion is flawless. Out of my collection of 130 Blu-ray titles, this would have to be on my top three in terms of visual detail, perhaps tying first place with Tron:Legacy, another epically gorgeous-looking film. I simply cannot say enough good things about how incredibly perfect the video detail looks on this blu-ray, and is way ahead of the visuals I saw in the movie theaters for this film.Now to make matters even better, the film also contains one of the crispest, cleanest, most flawless audio soundtracks I've ever heard. The film runs on the latest TrueHD Dolby sound, and it is well noticed (even though other soundtracks that run on the same system don't sound nearly as good). Every sound is not only audible, from the voices to wind and fire battles, but every single sound is even, smooth and incredibly clean. The music in the film itself ever even borders on overtaking the film, and while the soundtrack score to the movie is great, the general volume level of it is kept at a respectable distance, guiding the film's entire feel, giving the viewer an almost subconscious trip into the world of the Vikings because it never boasts saying ""hey, listen to me, i sound really good at the expense of the voices and other things."" No, the soundtrack knows its place, as well as all the other sounds; nothing is ever too loud or too low, but there's other way to say it - it's juuuuust right. So just as the video is one of the absolute best I've ever seen, the audio soundtrack is one of the absolute best I've ever heard. It amazes me just how much work was put into making this blu-ray transfer this good.In closing, in terms of blu-ray performance, I believe 'Dragon' should be playing on all retail store tv displays, if only to show the absolute maximum capacity of every television unit they are selling. Yup, it looks THAT good. My hat goes off to the transfer team to showing us exactly what the power of blu-ray can do. Hence a great story, great characters, and stunning presentation make this an easy pick for any movie fan.",5,A Fantastic Epic Viking Adventure,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,6689,"['How', 'Train',

Not only is it visually amazing, the cast is fantastic(Jay Baruchel as Hiccup, Gerard Butler as Stoick, Jonah Hill as Snotlout, Craig Ferguson as Gobber, and America Ferrara as Astrid). But awesome cast aside, in this movie, even the dragons had personality!The story is simple. Hiccup, a scrawny Viking boy who can't seem to fit in, unknowingly shoots down and injures a feared Night Fury dragon. The dragon has lost part of his tail wing, and can't fly. However the compassionate Hiccup can't bring himself to kill it. Instead Hiccup befriends the dragon, naming him Toothless, and invents a contraption that allows Toothless to finally fly free. Hiccup's friendship with Toothless helps him to view dragons and his world differently, and to challenge everything that he's been taught.How to Train Your Dragon is a heartwarming story of trust and friendship, and carving new paths for yourself even when you've been trained to follow old ones. There are lots of laughs and great dialogue, and I have to admit there were one or two emotional moments too. Great film for grown-ups and kids.

Daniel ""Alex""","[1, 1]","Dreamworks' HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is an excellent movie -- I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie, and I went in with moderately high anticipation.  The movie is about a Nordic village that is constantly under attack by dragons and the one unlikely hero that discovers a way to save it.  Here are three (hopefully solid) reasons why I would recommend this movie to everyone:1)  It's great for both adults and children.It's hard to do right, but HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON uses a great blend of entertainment for all ages.  This movie will appeal to adults -- there's plenty of higher-brow comedy that doesn't rely on simple slapstick pratfalls.  For kids (even the youngest of them), there's plenty of nice slapstick comedy and jokes that don't rely on much language (thanks to the speechless dragons).  And really, who doesn't think dragons are at least a little bit cool?2)  The visuals are stunning.Unfortunately, this movie misses out with the absence of IMAX or 3D cinema.  There are some seriously spectacular visuals in HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON -- some of the flight scenes are top-notch.  Don't be fooled by the cartoony character designs -- the animation here is done really well.  There are a few scenes towards the ending that I would rate among my favorite 3D-Animated/CG shots.  Like most movies though, the biggest screen you can get, the better.3)  The story is a lot of fun.As a jaded and cynical adult, I found myself rooting for the good guys, booing the bad guys, and grinning through the flight scenes.  The movie is pretty light-hearted, and while it does tread some familiar ground, its personality is enough to hide any of these narrative cliches.  The main characters, Hiccup is very likeable, and the dragon Toothless is downright adorable.I saw HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON via Amazon's Instant Video and there were no defective points at all.  It worked flawlessly -- no stutters in framerate compared to the animation.  I would recommend this movie to most people that I know -- there's not much here to not like aside from the title.

The Dreamworks Animated Studios did a perfect job with this movie and putting it together like a sculpture full of beauty. My favorite character is Toothless. Toothless is a lovable and storng dragon who reminds me of a Pokemon and Stitch from ""Lilo and Stitch"". Toothless was also cute and he is one of my favorite movie animals of all time (even if he is a 3D character).One of my favorite scenes in this movie is where Hiccup comes back for Toothless and both characters draw on the ground. After Hiccup draws Toothless on the ground, Toothless the dragon ended up creating his own drawing (which is in the form of a neat scribble). Before Toothless honors Hiccup with trust, Hiccup was able to dance around Toothless' drawing without stepping on the lines (which would cause Hiccup to get himself harmed if he did it more than three times). This scene was truly original and creative, and I made me tear and feel joyful.My other favorite scenes involve Toothless flying in the air with Hiccup and Astrid during the afternoon, and Toothless takes on a mean, gigantic dragon near the movie's end.This movie is a treat for all who like dragons and this is by far Dreamwork Animated Studios' best movie yet.

It is a funny, charming, well-animated film using 3-D to enhance everything about it.A small Viking village constantly battles a number of dragons that repeatedly attack their small seaside hamlet. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel, ""She's Out of My League"", ""Knocked Up"") is the thin, slight young man who wants to play a bigger part in his town's defenses. But every time he steps outside of the family cottage, he ends up causing trouble. His dad, Stoic (Gerard Butler), a big, commanding Viking who is in charge of the town, wants him to remain at the blacksmith shop, under the watchful eye of his friend, Bogger (Craig Ferguson). But the dragons continue to attack and they need to train new recruits, so Stoic sneaks into a new training class and meets Astrid (America Ferrera, TV's ""Ugly Betty"") and they form a rivalry. Bogger throws every species of dragon at them and Astrid handily beats them while Stoic has to pay attention to keep from tripping over his own feet. One night, during an attack, Stoic tests an invention and seems to strike one of the infamous black Night Flyer dragons, hard to see when they attack at night. The next day, he escapes to the forest and finds the felled beast. They form a friendship, naming his new friend Toothless, and Hiccup begins to learn how to handle the beasts that have plagued his village for so long.Directed by Dean Debois and Chris Sanders (the team behind ""Lilo & Stitch""), ""Dragon"" takes a welcome step back. Instead of trying to make everything super-realistic, the film is designed to look cartoonish. The male Vikings are big, but top heavy with broad chests and full beards. Hiccup is a tiny, gangly kid. Each of the types of dragons is different with a personality of their own.When Hiccup meets the Night Flyer dragon he has injured, he first tries to kill the beast, but he is unable to. Dubbing his new friend Toothless, they start to form a friendship and Hiccup learns about the other dragons his friend knows too well, using this knowledge to impress Astrid, Bogger and ultimately his father, Stoic.As their friendship grows, Hiccup learns the dragons are really just trying to protect themselves. In fact, they would rather just fly and play and cavort through the skies and forest. Just as this happens, his dad, Stoic, leads a group to infiltrate the hidden dragon lair, they have finally learned of the location. Hiccup tries to intervene, but his dad is determined to put a stop to the attacks.As Hiccup and Toothless become more familiar with one another, they become friends, and eventually play with one another. These scenes are the most endearing to me because Toothless (and the other dragons for that matter) have the characteristics or kittens and puppies. Toothless' behaviors and mannerisms could have been modeled on my cat; he prances around and pretends to hide, playfully waiting to attack Hiccup, a sly grin on his face, ready to roll around and play. The animators have done a great job of capturing this look and feel and translating it to these creatures, making them appear more familiar to us.Jay Baruchel does a great job providing the voice for Hiccup; he perfectly captures the pre-adolescent gravely voice reinforcing the fact he is barely a teenager, yet he lives in a society forcing these kids to become men before their time. Despite his scratchy voice, he is eager and willing to become a Viking, to fight the dragons, to use his inventions to help his father and their fellow villagers battle these beasts. Later, when he meets Toothless, he realizes he has something he never had before. A friend. Also, his friendship with Toothless provides him with an empowering freedom he has never enjoyed. As Hiccup rides his new friend, they fly through the skies. Initially, Hiccup is terrified, but he quickly learns to appreciate this newfound freedom. In fact, he seems to savor the new freedom.Gerard Butler's gravelly voice is perfect for Stoic, the leader of the Viking village. At times, his voice is so 'Scottish', you might mistake it for Mike Meyers doing a riff on his ""Shrek"" voice. In fact, I initially thought it was Meyers, as I watched the trailer the first few times. Later, when I learned it was Butler, it seemed odd two animated films from the same studio would have such similar voices. But watching the film, I quickly forgot these initial thoughts and went along with Butler. Butler's voice is so thick he seems the perfect choice to play the leader of this Viking kingdom. His character is exaggerated in the right places (overly broad torso, tiny waist, big arms), giving him the most complete feel of a cartoon character I have seen in some time.Craig Ferguson is also good as Bogger. Honestly, I didn't realize it was Craig Ferguson providing the voice for this character until I read the credits. Often, movie and television stars appear in animated films and simply retain their own speaking voice. When this happens, you have to ask, ""what's the point?"" If they aren't going to add anything to the character, couldn't anyone play the part? In Ferguson's case, he does a great job building a character and hiding himself behind the faade of this Viking's voice.America Ferrera plays Astrid. Astrid is a fun character; a woman in a male-dominated society, she constantly wants to prove herself and make everyone realize how tough she is. As she has a reputation among her classmates, she is confident she will be able to excel at the dragon taming classes. She knows everything and is fearless enough. But Hiccup begins to use his newly acquired knowledge and quickly becomes the star pupil. Astrid becomes jealous and inquisitive and sets out to find his secret.Jonah Hill, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse play the other two students in the class. They are OK, but don't really have enough time to create very memorable characters.""Dragon"" combines a lot of elements typical to animated films, even some things that could be considered stereotypical or overdone. The beauty of this effort is these same elements are handled with a great deal of skill, making them seem interesting, seamless and believable. At the heart of the film is a fairly standard story about a boy trying to prove to his dad he isn't a loser. We've seen this a million times, but in this film, it seems more endearing somehow. Perhaps because the characters are so un-realistic and ""animated"", the film reminds us we are watching an animated movie, we are basically watching a moving picture book. And because of this, I found myself remembering simpler, more magical times.",4,"A Charming, Endearing Work of Art",1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,6664,"['How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'may', 'be', 'best',

Someone your parents and peers think of as an anchor dragging the rest of them down or as a mere inconvenience? How do you get past that?Berk is a small, Viking village located near the Arctic Circle. At least, that's an assumption I made based on the main character's statement that ""it snows nine months of the year and hails the other three"". That main character, Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is the only son of the village chief, Stoick the Vast (voiced by Gerard Butler). The village is under near-constant siege by outside forces. Those outside forces being dragons. Hiccup (Baruchel) is short, slim, and in no way strong. The one trade all villagers learn in their lifetime is the art of hunting and killing dragons. Gobber (Hiccup's employer and the proprietor of the village armory, voiced by Craig Ferguson) suggests that Hiccup stop all of ""this"" while gesturing to all of him. Gobber (Ferguson) is a man who has lost several limbs over the years, all during encounters with dragons. Hiccup, being seriously lacking in physical strength, designs and constructs a machine to propel the weapons that the other villagers simply throw by hand. Of course, during a trial run in front of Gobber, the machine strikes a villager. Hiccup takes that same apparatus to a mountaintop, fires on one of the few species of dragon that's never been captured or seen and, miraculously, causes that dragon to fall to earth. Overjoyed by this victory, Hiccup shouts in triumph but is soon set upon by a species of dragon that can breathe fire and produce fire throughout its entire body. He's rescued by his father who expresses disappointment in his son and disbelief in Hiccup's claim to have landed a blow against a Night Fury. He treks through the woods the next day, determined to find proof of his accomplishment, but finds something far more significant.Now, unlike a lot of ""adults"" I maintain my affection for ""children's"" movies. This is not to say that I like all, or even most, children's movies. For example, Despicable Me, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and Eight Crazy Nights disappointed me to a degree that I cannot express in words. But, in spite of its flaws or maybe because of them, I loved How to Train Your Dragon. Casting Baruchel as Hiccup was genius. Hiccup's peers, voiced by Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, America Ferrara and others, fit the roles they're given perfectly.

1304707,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002ZG97YM,Tsuyoshi,"[11, 12]","""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a fantasy adventure film from DreamWorks Animation. Unlike hilarious ""Shrek"" (I'm talking about the first one), the company's new computer animated film does not rearrange or subvert the genre's conventions much. Instead, with the straightforward narrative suitable for the material, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" tells a good story in a compelling way; in short, thrilling actions, likable characters and great animation.Set in the Viking village of Berk, the story begins with a young boy Hiccup (voice by Jay Baruchel, ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice""), who wants to be a real warrior, despite his obvious lack of skills, if not courage. One night, during the dragons' attacks on his village, Hiccup sets out to fight on his own with a weapon of his own making though his father and village leader Stoick (Gerard Butler) orders him to stay inside. Hiccup's reckless action results in the friendship between him and a wounded dragon the Night Fury or ""Toothless.""The story takes an unexpected turn when Hiccup realizes that dragons ""have to"" raid the village.

1304708,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B002ZG97YM,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[0, 0]","I haven't read the books by the same title, so I can't compare the movie to them, and I also did not see the film in 3-D so I can't address that aspect.What I can say is that on its own, and in a simple 2D environment, I felt this film was entertaining and inspiring. I think it can be appealing to both adults and children. However, I do have a few questions which I will point out below.Plot:The plot is not something new, it's basically a story about overcoming misunderstanding and prejudice, coupled with parents and kids not listening to each other. We've seen that before, treated many different ways. The film tends to lean more to the kid's side of the issue.  Kids are the main audience, so that makes sense.I won't belabor the plot points or the message the movie makes, it is better to catch them and decide for yourself (especially if you are a parent). Everyone will have a different take on these. Personally, it resonated with me and gave me reason to consider how I interact with those in my world.Animation/Character Look:It's not the standard stuff one would expect from Dreamworks, a-la ""Shrek"" and ""Toy Story"".The CGI characters are exaggerated in their appearance, making them more like a traditional cartoon. This, I think, adds to the fantasy aspect of the film and may be more familiar to the kid audience than the adult one, with a question.The kids in the movie are pretty much scrawny and look undernourished, yet the adults are so over inflated that they look distorted and in serious need of a diet. Not sure why they chose to differentiate the two groups visually so much. But they do work as characters thanks to the good script and the voice actors, as well as the animators, who do an excellent job.Another question is that although this is a movie about vikings, the adults speak in a Scottish accent, and the kids (including the hero and heroine) speak like Americans. I have no idea why they chose to do this.Animals:The dragons are of course the stars of the film, and here we see creature design unlike anything one might expect.Toothless, the ""hero dragon"" looks more like a large black cat than a dragon. This of course adds a curious appeal.Cats are wonderfully mysterious creatures, with hugely expressive eyes and ears. Toothless also has large expressive cat like eyes and ears, and no real horns to speak of.There is a lot of superstition about black cats (as a cat lover, I find that black cats are some of the most endearing members of the species) and an undertone in this movie may have been to make Toothless so black cat-like to underscore the danger of blindly following superstitious feelings, or of taking things at face value, when the true value lies underneath, as it does with Toothless and his loving heart.The other dragons are of all shapes and sizes and do not look like anything in traditional Western or Asian dragon art. Sure, they have spikes and horns and some incredibly long teeth. Their body style and sinewy shapes are graceful and elegant as well as fantastic. I found them fascinating, although it took two viewings of the movie to catch the incredible detail the designers and animators  put into them. They remind me of some of the characters in some 1950's educational Disney movies -- the ones about outer space and how life evolved on Earth (I think UPA had something to do with those old cartoons). Nevertheless, I felt as dragons they were very original and in many ways endearing, sometimes in a silly way.Scenery:It's just plain beautiful. They did such a good job with the forest scenes and even the interiors of the viking homes. Nice job, a treat for the eyes.Music:Very nice and appropriate ""epic/fantasy"" style music that supports the story very well. None of the themes are so large as to be truly memorable, (unlike ""Star Wars"", where so many themes stand out on their own), but it does the job of supporting the action and story very well and quite seamlessly.Flying Sequences:If you're going to have flying anything in a movie (let alone dragons) you've got to have great aerobatic flying sequences. This film has them with much of the exciting flavor of a WWII aerial dog fight or a camera set up on a roller coaster. At times the flying is sweeping and acrobatic, at other times, majestic. It's all fantasy of course, so much of the impossible stunts work because the film never tries to suggest anything is reality. This is a fantasy flight of fancy all the way through. Quite a lot of fun.Emotions:A good story can tug at the heart strings, but it has to be careful not to overdo it. This approach has been a staple of Disney movies throughout and this film shares that legacy. The difficult relations between Hiccup (the hero) and his father are touching, the exuberance of Hiccup as he flies on the back of Toothless, the touching way Toothless treats Hiccup and many more scenes are very emotional, but not overly so. There is appropriate tension and suspense during the fighting scenes.Conclusion:I give this movie 5 stars because it is everything a fantasy adventure is supposed to be, done in fine style. Although it is a 21st century film, it follows the legacy of fine fantasy films from the 1950's and 60's. It's not a blockbuster by any means, neither is it a waste of time.It's a fun and diverting couple of hours and it may give some members of the audience (adults mostly) pause for thought.I think it is definitely worth a rental -- for the animation and the story. Can't say if the discs are worth it, or how the 3-D works out however.",5,A Delightful Fantasy with All the Right Stuff,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,5546,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'same',

1304709,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002ZG97YM,Turfseer,"[1, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Who knew? Fire-breathing dragons deep down inside are really touchy-feely creatures as long as you know how to train them right. That essentially is the premise of the much-acclaimed Dreamworks animated film, 'How to Train Your Dragon'. Of course there's a deeper message here (quoting the late Rodney King): ""Why can't we all get along?"".This is perhaps the first film I can remember where the great pillaging clan of Vikings are not pitted against human opponents and hence their reputation as a group of sadistic, murderous thugs is tempered by the aggression of their dragon antagonists. Leave it to the film's protagonist, Hiccup, the young nerdy son of the Viking leader, Stoick the Vast (curiously voiced by Gerard Butler, with a Scottish accent!), to teach his community an important lesson: it's better to use your brains instead of brawn.It takes a while for 'Dragon' to get going as the break into the second act doesn't occur until Hiccup begins nursing 'Toothless', the cute but hyperactive dragon (that he's responsible for injuring), back to health. Toothless looks like a leopard with wings but appears to have the temperament of a lovable canine. It turns out that the dragons have an excuse for all their bad behavior: they're beholden to a giant 'killer' dragon who the Vikings fear but who have never seen. Hiccup uncovers the mystery of this frightening behemoth when he flies into its lair after figuring out how to pilot Toothless, without falling off of him, in the air.Meanwhile back at the Viking village, Hiccup, much to his chagrin, is forced to participate in dragon training school with a coterie of fellow young misfits. Voiced by such comic luminaries as Jonah Hill and Kirsten Wiig, Hiccup's 'associates' all follow the 'macho' Viking line: kill the unpleasant dragons at any cost. Much of the antics of the youngsters are rather one-note, as they parrot the macho posturing of the community at large. Finally, Hiccup, through his sensitive handling of the out of control creatures, turns his colleagues around and trains them how to calm the dragons down, without killing them.The stakes are raised when Hiccup refuses to kill a dragon at the end of the training and his father disowns him. Stoick, raises an armada of his heavily armed Vikings, and with Toothless in tow (now chained on board the lead vessel), head out to the island where the big, bad monster awaits them. Leave it to Hiccup and his buddies to save the day by flying out to the island on board the formerly imprisoned dragons (back at the training school) and eliminate the monster in a rousing fight to the finish.With the bad dragon eliminated, the dragon population 'understands' that the Vikings are really on their side and are now quite amenable to being house trained. And of course, even macho Stoick, sees the light and ends up apologizing to his son. I suppose all this is an acceptable children's story but adults will feel a little less satisfied. If underneath, this is a tale about how humans treat animals, it's a rather fanciful conceit that leopards or tigers (which the dragons seemingly represent), can so easily be domesticated. If on the other hand, if the dragons represent a misunderstood group of humans (demonized by the Vikings who lack the insight into their nature), the fact that they ALL suddenly become peaceful (because they're now treated with 'sensitivity' by humans), hardly seems to reflect the reality of true human-to-human interactions. Throughout history, attempts to mollify belligerent peoples through appeasement, have resulted in disastrous consequences.In short, 'How to Train Your Dragon', is a feel-good tale, politically correct tale, best suited for children. Adults, however, will still be much impressed by the excellent, sumptuous animation, painstakingly created over a number of years by a group of highly talented animators. Whether the animation is enough for the viewer to overlook the rather lackluster story, is a matter of personal taste. For me, 'How to Train Your Dragon' is worth a look, decidedly for its impressive technical achievements, as opposed to its rather predictable narrative.",3,Worth looking at more for its impressive animation than politically correct narrative,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,4194,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Who', 'knew', 'Fire-breathing', 'dragons', 'deep', 'inside', 'are', 'really', 'touchy-feely', 'creatures', 'as', 'long', 'know', 'how', 'train', 'right', 'essentially', 'premise', 'much-acclaimed', 'Dreamworks', 'animated', 'film', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'course', 'deeper', 'message', 'here', 'quoting', 'late', 'Rodney', 'King', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', '.This', 'perhaps', 'first', 'film', 'can', 'remember', 'where', 'great', 'pillaging', 'clan', 'Vikings', 'are', 'not', 'pitted', 'human', 'opponents', 'hence', 'reputation', 'group', 'sadistic', 'murderous', 'thugs', 'tempered', 'aggression', 'dragon', 'antagonists', 'Leave', 'film', 'protagonist', 'Hiccup', 'young', 'nerdy', 'son', 'Viking', 'leader', 'Stoick', 'Vast', 'curiously', 'voiced', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'teach', 'community', 'important', 'lesson', 'better', 'use', 'brains', 'instead', 'brawn.It', 'while', ""'Dragon"", 'get', 'going', 'break', 'second', 'act', ""n't"", 'occur', 'Hiccup', 'nursing', ""'Toothless"", 'cute', 'hyperactive', 'dragon', 'responsible', 'injuring', 'back', 'health', 'Toothless', 'leopard', 'wings', 'have', 'temperament', 'lovable', 'canine', 'out', 'dragons', 'have', 'excuse', 'bad', 'behavior', ""'re"", 'beholden', 'giant', ""'killer"", 'dragon', 'who', 'Vikings', 'fear', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Hiccup', 'mystery', 'frightening', 'behemoth', 'when', 'lair', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'pilot', 'Toothless', 'falling', 'air.Meanwhile', 'back', 'Viking', 'village', 'Hiccup', 'much', 'chagrin', 'forced', 'participate', 'dragon', 'training', 'school', 'coterie', 'fellow', 'young', 'misfits', 'Voiced', 'such', 'comic', 'luminaries', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Kirsten', 'Wiig', 'Hiccup', ""'associates"", 'follow', ""'macho"", 'Viking', 'line', 'kill', 'unpleasant', 'dragons', 'cost', 'Much', 'antics', 'youngsters', 'are', 'rather', 'one-note', 'parrot', 'macho', 'posturing', 'community', 'large', 'Finally', 'Hiccup', 'sensitive', 'handling', 'out', 'control', 'creatures', 'colleagues', 'how', 'calm', 'dragons', 'down', 'killing', 'them.The', 'stakes', 'are', 'raised', 'when', 'Hiccup', 'kill', 'dragon', 'end', 'training', 'father', 'disowns', 'Stoick', 'armada', 'heavily', 'armed', 'Vikings', 'Toothless', 'tow', 'now', 'chained', 'board', 'lead', 'vessel', 'head', 'island', 'where', 'big', 'bad', 'monster', 'Leave', 'Hiccup', 'buddies', 'save', 'day', 'flying', 'out', 'island', 'board', 'formerly', 'imprisoned', 'dragons', 'back', 'training', 'school', 'eliminate', 'monster', 'rousing', 'fight', 'finish.With', 'bad', 'dragon', 'eliminated', 'dragon', 'population', 'Vikings', 'are', 'really', 'side', 'are', 'now', 'quite', 'amenable', 'being', 'house', 'trained', 'course', 'even', 'macho', 'Stoick', 'light', 'up', 'apologizing', 'son', 'suppose', 'acceptable', 'children', 'story', 'adults', 'will', 'feel', 'little', 'less', 'satisfied', 'underneath', 'tale', 'how', 'humans', 'treat', 'animals', 'rather', 'fanciful', 'conceit', 'tigers', 'dragons', 'seemingly', 'represent', 'can', 'so', 'easily', 'be', 'domesticated', 'other', 'hand', 'dragons', 'represent', 'misunderstood', 'group', 'humans', 'demonized', 'Vikings', 'who', 'lack', 'insight', 'nature', 'fact', 'suddenly', 'become', 'peaceful', ""'re"", 'now', 'treated', ""'sensitivity"", 'humans', 'hardly', 'reflect', 'reality', 'true', 'human-to-human', 'interactions', 'history', 'attempts', 'mollify', 'belligerent', 'peoples', 'appeasement', 'have', 'resulted', 'disastrous', 'consequences.In', 'short', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'feel-good', 'tale', 'politically', 'correct', 'tale', 'best', 'suited', 'children', 'Adults', 'however', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'much', 'impressed', 'excellent', 'sumptuous', 'animation', 'painstakingly', 'created', 'over', 'number', 'years', 'group', 'highly', 'talented', 'animators', 'animation', 'enough', 'viewer', 'overlook', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'story', 'matter', 'personal', 'taste', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'look', 'decidedly', 'impressive', 'technical', 'achievements', 'opposed', 'rather', 'predictable', 'narrative']",N/A

First, the animation: Superb, as always, and things like hair and fur just get better at every turn of technology. Second, the plot: inept boy makes good despite the wrong-headed grownups, and the cute girl likes him in the end (as does everyone else).  Third, the misfits who just happen to fit together very well. You'll find out about that when you see it. Like a great chef making wonderful pastry from ordinary ingredients, Dreamworks cooks up these common elements into a delectable treat.So much for the big things, which all come together well. The little things really make this movie. For instance, there's the grizzled old wardog explaining that he lost his leg to a dragon because he's delicious, but that's just one moment in the ongoing banter. The fearsomely capable girl is good too, even if that role has become a commonplace. She'd whomp our hero at any known skill, so he comes out ahead using unknown skills. The awkwardness between dad and teen son has warmth enough, in a way that might bring the viewer's own past awkwardness back to life for just a moment. The dragons have as much personality as the humans, if not more, together with a few charming feline traits. And the hat ... again, you'll have to see that one for yourself.Art, story, characters: it all comes together in a great family entertainment.

1304723,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002ZG97YM,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","This film endeared itself to me from the moment I heard the name of the young hero - Hiccup! Yes, apparently, in Viking lore, the more unpleasant one's name, the greater the chances of avoiding trolls and all manner of unpleasantness. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is a young Viking lad, who lives in an isolated Viking village far from the rest of civilization, and where most of the population is engaged in defending their village from marauding dragons of all kinds. Hiccup feels he is a disappointment to his father, Viking leader Stoick (voiced by Scotsman Gerard Butler) whose sole purpose in life is to kill dragons. Hiccup initially believes the way to his father's heart and that of a comely Viking lass, Astrid (America Ferrara), is to prove himself by killing a dragon. Since he possesses a small build, his only hope of killing a dragon is through ingenious means, and Hiccup invents a contraption that elicits derision from others, but one night, during a fierce dragon attack, Hiccup actually manages to catch a dragon. Unfortunately for Hiccup, the dragon disappears into the forest and no one believes him.Later, Hiccup who has already been labeled a hopeless case by his peers and fellow villagers is compelled to enter dragon-fighting training - with fellow trainees Astrid, Fishlegs (Christopher Mintze-Plasse), Snotlout (Jonah Hill), and twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut (Kristen Wiig and T.J. MIller). This is also the time Hiccup discovers the missing dragon, which turns out to be of the Night Fury variety of dragon - so swift that never has one been captured and nothing is known of it.The story moves along at a suitable pace and never lags - nor is it paced too fast. The story is allowed to develop as well as the characters- especially of the dragon ""Toothless"" and the boy Hiccup. The evolving relationship between dragon and boy is one of the sweetest highlights of the movie. The viewer gets to witness the slow progression from mistrust and suspicion (on the part of the dragon) and fear (on Hiccup's side) to gradual friendship, trust, and a deep, abiding sense of loyalty. The dragons featured in this film do not speak, which to me is a bonus - they convey their emotions through their eyes (and boy, does Toothless have a pair of expressive ones) and actions.The dragons are a joy to watch - there are all sorts of varieties, from the clumsy, stocky ones to the long-necked, elegant ones, and truly ferocious, mean-looking ones. The twist halfway through the story kept the plot interesting and fresh. There's also a startling twist towards the end that challenges the traditional manner of approaching kid's movies (to say more would constitute a spoiler).The humor is pitched at an appropriate level - kids will get most of it, and adults will find some amusing bits as well, though this is very much a kids' movie (no pop culture references here) and a movie for the kids in all of us. I loved the messages conveyed in this movie - that it's okay to be different, in fact marching to the beat of a different drum (as portrayed by Hiccup's character) is something desirable and not to be mocked at or belittled. The movie also provides educational insights - Hiccup's methods in gaining Toothless' trust and obedience is reminiscent of how humans train dogs/horses, and his various experiments in determining what repels dragons will encourage inquiry thinking in young children (great discussion point for parents and children here).The concept of hands-on learning is prevalent throughout the movie. The themes of friendship, loyalty, and communication between parent and child are also strongly emphasized to good effect.The effects are amazing - watching dragons in flight, especially in 3-D is pure poetry and the battle scenes are well done, without going over the top on the violent bits. The movie is rated PG for sequences of intense action and some scary scenes, and brief mild language. I did not find anything in this movie which was offensive, and we (husband and I) took our 5-year-old to watch it - all three of us enjoyed it immensely. The movie runs about 98 minutes. Final verdict - fun and wonderful entertainment for the entire family, and certainly worth splurging on the 3-D.",5,Be careful with that dragon!,1269648000,"03 27, 2010",2010,4232,"['film', 'endeared', 'moment', 'heard', 'name', 'young', 'hero', 'Hiccup', 'Yes', 'apparently', 'Viking', 'lore', 'more', 'unpleasant', 'one', 'name', 'greater', 'chances', 'avoiding', 'trolls', 'manner', 'unpleasantness', 'Hiccup', 'voiced', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'young', 'Viking', 'lad', 'who', 'isolated', 'Viking', 'village', 'far', 'rest', 'civilization', 'where', 'most', 'population', 'engaged', 'defending', 'village', 'marauding', 'dragons', 'kinds', 'Hiccup', 'feels', 'disappointment', 'father', 'Viking', 'leader', 'Stoick', 'voiced', 'Scotsman', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'sole', 'purpose', 'life', 'kill', 'dragons', 'Hiccup', 'initially', 'way', 'father', 'heart', 'comely', 'Viking', 'lass', 'Astrid', 'America', 'Ferrara', 'prove', 'killing', 'dragon', 'small', 'build', 'only', 'hope', 'killing', 'dragon', 'ingenious', 'means', 'Hiccup', 'contraption', 'derision', 'others', 'one', 'night', 'fierce', 'dragon', 'attack', 'Hiccup', 'actually', 'catch', 'dragon', 'Unfortunately', 'Hiccup', 'dragon', 'forest', 'one', 'him.Later', 'Hiccup', 'who', 'already', 'been', 'labeled', 'hopeless', 'case', 'peers', 'fellow', 'villagers', 'compelled', 'enter', 'dragon-fighting', 'training', 'fellow', 'trainees', 'Astrid', 'Fishlegs', 'Christopher', 'Mintze-Plasse', 'Snotlout', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'twins', 'Ruffnut', 'Tuffnut', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'T.J.', 'MIller', 'also', 'time', 'Hiccup', 'missing', 'dragon', 'out', 'be', 'Night', 'Fury', 'variety', 'dragon', 'so', 'swift', 'never', 'one', 'been', 'captured', 'nothing', 'known', 'it.The', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'suitable', 'pace', 'never', 'paced', 'too', 'fast', 'story', 'allowed', 'develop', 'as', 'well', 'characters-', 'especially', 'dragon', 'Toothless', 'boy', 'Hiccup', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'dragon', 'boy', 'one', 'sweetest', 'highlights', 'movie', 'viewer', 'witness', 'slow', 'progression', 'mistrust', 'suspicion', 'part', 'dragon', 'fear', 'Hiccup', 'side', 'gradual', 'friendship', 'trust', 'deep', 'abiding', 'sense', 'loyalty', 'dragons', 'featured', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'bonus', 'convey', 'emotions', 'eyes', 'boy', 'Toothless', 'have', 'pair', 'expressive', 'ones', 'actions.The', 'dragons', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'are', 'sorts', 'varieties', 'clumsy', 'stocky', 'ones', 'long-necked', 'elegant', 'ones', 'truly', 'ferocious', 'mean-looking', 'ones', 'twist', 'halfway', 'story', 'kept', 'plot', 'interesting', 'fresh', 'also', 'startling', 'twist', 'end', 'traditional', 'manner', 'approaching', 'kid', 'movies', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'constitute', 'spoiler', '.The', 'humor', 'pitched', 'appropriate', 'level', 'kids', 'will', 'get', 'most', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'amusing', 'bits', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'much', 'kids', 'movie', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'here', 'movie', 'kids', 'loved', 'messages', 'conveyed', 'movie', 'okay', 'be', 'different', 'fact', 'marching', 'beat', 'different', 'drum', 'portrayed', 'Hiccup', 'character', 'something', 'desirable', 'not', 'be', 'mocked', 'belittled', 'movie', 'also', 'educational', 'insights', 'Hiccup', 'methods', 'gaining', 'Toothless', 'trust', 'obedience', 'reminiscent', 'how', 'humans', 'train', 'dogs/horses', 'various', 'experiments', 'determining', 'what', 'repels', 'dragons', 'will', 'encourage', 'inquiry', 'thinking', 'young', 'children', 'great', 'discussion', 'point', 'parents', 'children', 'here', '.The', 'concept', 'hands-on', 'learning', 'prevalent', 'movie', 'themes', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'communication', 'parent', 'child', 'are', 'also', 'strongly', 'emphasized', 'good', 'effect.The', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'watching', 'dragons', 'flight', 'especially', '3-D', 'pure', 'poetry', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'going', 'top', 'violent', 'bits', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'sequences', 'intense', 'action', 'scary', 'scenes', 'brief', 'mild', 'language', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'anything', 'movie', 'was', 'offensive', 'husband', 'took', '5-year-old', 'watch', 'three', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'movie', '98', 'minutes', 'Final', 'verdict', 'fun', 'wonderful', 'entertainment', 'entire', 'family', 'certainly', 'worth', 'splurging', '3-D']",N/A
