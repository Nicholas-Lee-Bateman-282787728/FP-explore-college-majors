The quality of the sets, the writing, the costumes, etc.... all seem to have grown for the third season.They introduce a new character, the annoying and bratty Jool.  A long time cast member finally dies.  They explore more around them and actually explain some of what is going on.  The previous two seasons they were running and escaping so much nothing was explained in any sort of detail.  You finally see the interaction of D'argo and Jothee.  The reasons behind Scorpius's obsession for wormhole technology.  Crais is accepted as being Talyn's protector and shows why he feels a bond with him.The characters themselves also seem more mature.  D'argo is more trusting and not as bull headed as before.  John isn't as whiny as before, and keeping his knowlege secret is his duty.  Aeryn is evolving emotionally, and not as filled with rage as before.  Even Rygel shows more human qualities while still remaining the bastard we have grown to love.Highlights includeThe Season Of Death:  Aeryn is pulled from the land of the dead by Zhann, with dire consequences.  John is restored to his old self.Suns and Lovers:  The ship lands on a merchant station to restock their supplies.  But the station is being targetted by a group of religious fanatics that believe it is on holy ground and must be destroyed, so the crew helps out rescuing people in the broken base.

The aliens want to abandon Moya and leave in their ship, while the crew wants to try to save their friend.  A crew member dies and another is introduced.Different Destinations:  The crew is somehow pulled back in time to a group of missionaries besieged by an overwhelming enemy.  They find that they can alter time, but want to return before they change things for the worse.Eat Me:  They are in a pod and encounter a disaster, so they land on a seemingly deserted leviathon to make repairs.  The ship is full of strange inbred peacekeepers and an even stranger maniac.  A strange new character is introduced.Thanks for Sharing:  Talyn is badly wounded and they are trying to find resources to help out on the planet, inhabated by sci fi goths.  But there is strange resistance, and they think there is a conspiracy against them.  Possibly by the same Peacekeeper squad that attacked Talyn.Green Eyed Monster:  The crew was seperated, half on talyn and half on moya.  Talyn is swallowed by the biggest creature in the galaxy, a budong.Relativity:  Talyn lands on a jungle planet to assist in healing.  Aeryns mother turns out to be charge of the squad to capture Talyn, and is deadly efficient.Incubator:  Scorpius tries to show the clone of john created on the chip his reasons for hating the Scarrans and obsession with wormholes.  So we get to see his disturbing history.Scratch and Sniff:  Farscape on acid, on a 70's style beach planet.  The crew is put off Moya so pilot and Moya can have some silence.  They are waylayed by a drug dealer who wants Jool and Chiana for a drug made from sentient creatures pheramones.Infinite Possibilites I&II;:  John and Aeryn are contacted by the Ancients to find why someone is using wormhole tech.  Turns out that the odd mechanic Furlow created a prototype, and is being hunted by Scarran allies for the working model.Fractures:  The crew is reunited, and find another group of prisoners on run from the Peacekeepers, including a Nebari, a Scarran, a Hynerian, and a captured Peacekeeper.I Yensch you Yensch:  Scorpius is willing to cut a deal with the crew for wormhole tech.  They introduce a Yensch bracelet, what one feels, the other feels, and plan on putting on on Scorpius, the other on John to insure they keep their bargain.  Talyn shows his paranoia and aggressive behavoir and attacks Moya, then agrees to be shut off.Into the Lions Den I&II;:  The crew is now on a Peackeeper command carrier, and working with the enemy.  But John secretly wants to sabotage the project but walks on eggshells to keep Scorpius from discovering this.  We get to see more of the Peacekeepers and how they function internally.  Including the sultry new Commandant Grayza.Dog With Two Bones:  The crew goes to bury Talyn and prepare to part ways.  John makes a shocking discovery about Aeryn.",5,The series continues to evolve,1095379200,"09 17, 2004",2004,4472,"['show', 'getting', 'better', 'matures', 'yet', 'season', 'excellence', 'quality', 'sets', 'writing', 'costumes', 'etc', 'seem', 'have', 'grown', 'third', 'season.They', 'introduce', 'new', 'character', 'annoying', 'bratty', 'Jool', 'A', 'long', 'time', 'cast', 'member', 'finally', 'explore', 'more', 'actually', 'explain', 'what', 'going', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'running', 'escaping', 'so', 'much', 'nothing', 'was', 'explained', 'sort', 'detail', 'finally', 'see', 'interaction', ""D'argo"", 'Jothee', 'reasons', 'Scorpius', 'obsession', 'wormhole', 'technology', 'Crais', 'accepted', 'being', 'Talyn', 'protector', 'why', 'bond', 'him.The', 'characters', 'also', 'seem', 'more', 'mature', ""D'argo"", 'more', 'trusting', 'not', 'bull', 'headed', 'before', 'John', ""n't"", 'as', 'whiny', 'keeping', 'knowlege', 'secret', 'duty', 'Aeryn', 'evolving', 'emotionally', 'not', 'filled', 'rage', 'Even', 'Rygel', 'more', 'human', 'qualities', 'still', 'remaining', 'bastard', 'have', 'grown', 'love.Highlights', 'includeThe', 'Season', 'Death', 'Aeryn', 'pulled', 'land', 'dead', 'Zhann', 'dire', 'consequences', 'John', 'restored', 'old', 'self.Suns', 'Lovers', 'ship', 'merchant', 'station', 'restock', 'supplies', 'station', 'being', 'targetted', 'group', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'believe', 'holy', 'ground', 'must', 'be', 'destroyed', 'crew', 'out', 'rescuing', 'people', 'broken', 'base', 'Chian', 'Jothee', 'make', 'bad', 'choices.Self', 'Inflicted', 'Wounds', '1', '2', 'ship', 'group', 'strange', 'alien', 'scientists', 'Moya', 'damaged', 'are', 'caught', 'space', 'wormholes', 'aliens', 'want', 'abandon', 'Moya', 'leave', 'ship', 'crew', 'try', 'save', 'friend', 'crew', 'member', 'dies', 'introduced.Different', 'Destinations', 'crew', 'somehow', 'pulled', 'back', 'time', 'group', 'missionaries', 'besieged', 'overwhelming', 'enemy', 'find', 'can', 'alter', 'time', 'want', 'return', 'change', 'things', 'worse.Eat', 'Me', 'are', 'pod', 'encounter', 'disaster', 'land', 'seemingly', 'deserted', 'leviathon', 'make', 'repairs', 'ship', 'full', 'strange', 'inbred', 'peacekeepers', 'even', 'stranger', 'maniac', 'strange', 'new', 'character', 'introduced.Thanks', 'Sharing', 'Talyn', 'badly', 'wounded', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'resources', 'help', 'out', 'planet', 'inhabated', 'sci', 'fi', 'goths', 'strange', 'resistance', 'think', 'conspiracy', 'Possibly', 'same', 'Peacekeeper', 'squad', 'attacked', 'Talyn.Green', 'Eyed', 'Monster', 'crew', 'was', 'seperated', 'half', 'talyn', 'half', 'moya', 'Talyn', 'swallowed', 'biggest', 'creature', 'galaxy', 'budong.Relativity', 'Talyn', 'jungle', 'planet', 'assist', 'healing', 'Aeryns', 'mother', 'out', 'be', 'charge', 'squad', 'capture', 'Talyn', 'deadly', 'efficient.Incubator', 'Scorpius', 'show', 'clone', 'john', 'created', 'chip', 'reasons', 'hating', 'Scarrans', 'obsession', 'wormholes', 'get', 'see', 'disturbing', 'history.Scratch', 'Sniff', 'Farscape', 'acid', '70', 'style', 'beach', 'planet', 'crew', 'put', 'off', 'Moya', 'pilot', 'Moya', 'can', 'have', 'silence', 'are', 'waylayed', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'Jool', 'Chiana', 'drug', 'made', 'sentient', 'creatures', 'pheramones.Infinite', 'Possibilites', 'II', 'John', 'Aeryn', 'are', 'contacted', 'Ancients', 'find', 'why', 'someone', 'using', 'wormhole', 'tech', 'out', 'odd', 'mechanic', 'Furlow', 'created', 'prototype', 'being', 'hunted', 'Scarran', 'allies', 'working', 'model.Fractures', 'crew', 'reunited', 'find', 'group', 'prisoners', 'run', 'Peacekeepers', 'including', 'Nebari', 'Scarran', 'Hynerian', 'captured', 'Peacekeeper.I', 'Yensch', 'Yensch', 'Scorpius', 'willing', 'cut', 'deal', 'crew', 'wormhole', 'tech', 'introduce', 'Yensch', 'bracelet', 'what', 'one', 'feels', 'other', 'feels', 'plan', 'putting', 'Scorpius', 'other', 'John', 'insure', 'keep', 'bargain', 'Talyn', 'paranoia', 'aggressive', 'behavoir', 'attacks', 'Moya', 'then', 'be', 'shut', 'Lions', 'Den', 'II', 'crew', 'now', 'Peackeeper', 'command', 'carrier', 'working', 'enemy', 'John', 'secretly', 'sabotage', 'project', 'walks', 'eggshells', 'keep', 'Scorpius', 'discovering', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'Peacekeepers', 'how', 'function', 'internally', 'Including', 'sultry', 'new', 'Commandant', 'Grayza.Dog', 'Two', 'Bones', 'crew', 'bury', 'Talyn', 'prepare', 'part', 'ways', 'John', 'shocking', 'discovery', 'Aeryn']",N/A

When i finally finished season three i recalled how naive i was to the plight of some wimpy scientist named John Chichton. My wife tried to rag on me until i sat her down and made her watch.

I enjoyed the first two seasons of Farscape, but the third left me with a strong desire to cut myself and possibly thinking that maybe I should simply do away with my loved ones so that they wouldn't have to face the dark reality of life. I can understand and see the value of a little angst in a storyline, but to lay hour after hour onto the screen and still demonstrate a voracious hunger for more darkness is beyond me. I wanted a little of the fun of the first two seasons back. I see why they couldn't get the backing for a 5th season.

Obviously this show was not cheap to produce, but with knowledge of releases to DVD seasons (which by 2004 were becomming more and more popular) you would likely have movie deals, and advertisng rights on that alone could have made gobs of money. Well enough ranting let me tell you about sseson 3.\I earlier called this season the greatest, and let me explain why, the show at this point has built a tension between the characters (most notably John and Aeryn, this one is tangible, and at the end of season 2, John is mildly responsible  (at least in his head) for Aeryn's death. I am a guy and most of the times do not go for the overly romantic story arc's shows ride. But in Season 3, I am rooting for them, really pulling that somehow it will all work, and for a while it does...kinda. They have 2 John's not a cloned John, but literally 2, same thoughts backrounds, lives, feelings, and the sequences on board Talyn are some of the most emotionally gripping Television, movie, book, story, etc ever in history. Your heart is grabbed by them and then smashed and destroyed by the end. This season does more than tell a story, amd invite you for a ride. It grabs you from the first episode and pulls you on board Moya and Talyn.So you think this season is just the John and Aeryn show, not even close. The stories behind Crais, Scorpious, the loss of a character, the addition of others. D'Argo, and Chiana. This season is mind numbingly good. I feel get a few people with financial backing to watch this season, and you could have had many more seasons, movies, and so on.Maybe its a dream, and as we hear from another new character (not all dreams are realized) but there has to be a way. Funding from bake sales, collections from fans, studios, Henson, there has to be something to give us one more shot.

I think the show is interesting as a view into a descent to madness.  The protagonist John Crichton starts the series as a diplomatic non-violent and anti-violence character yet by season 3 he's packin' heat and embracing violence but as he adopts violence throughout the series the character develops more and more unstable behaviours breaking down into manic states in the middle of chaotic violent situations.  Overall the show is very well made using Jim Henson puppets and limited use of CGI effects.  It really stands out in the sci-fi world.  The women are strong lead characters and create well portrayed non-objectified role models which are severely lacking in 90% of not just sci-fi but media as a whole.

With a much darker tone, and the major arc that would shape the series until it's end taking shape, it is clear that this is sci-fi TV at it's best.  Crichton (Ben Browder) returns to his old self, while Aeryn's (Claudia Black) life hangs in the balance.  Scorpius' (Wayne Pygram) obsession with wormhole technology is revealed in it's entirity, while Dargo (Anthony Simcoe) and Chiana's (Gigi Edgely) relationship takes a turn for the worst when Chiana begins an affair with Dargo's son Jothee.  The third season of Farscape also the sacrifice of a character who has been here since the beginning, as well as the tragic losses of a few others while introducing new heroes and villains; culminating in a clone of Crichton and Aeryn consumating their relationship with tragic results.  Like the above Amazon review says, this is when Farscape really becomes a more mature show, as we witness our favorite characters go to hell and back, with one heck of a cliffhanger ending.

835690,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0002IQFG8,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[2, 2]","The third season of Farscape is easily my favorite out of the four seasons and one miniseries. Though it suffers the loss of a beloved original character whose absence is keenly felt throughout the rest of the show's run, it fires on all cylinders as it races through great episode after great episode, cutting out surplus filler and concentrating on tightly-written character arcs and storylines that culminate in one of the best season finales ever to air on television.For the uninitiated, a brief run-down: ""Farscape"" is a quintessential space opera surrounding the exploits of a group of escaped prisoners and one lost American astronaut (our protagonist, John Crichton). Aboard a living ship called Moya, a sentient vessel who communicates with her passengers through an alien known as Pilot, and having recently given birth to a dangerous young warship named Talyn, the crew of fugitives flees from the military arm of the government known as Peacekeepers.The crew of Moya (who include D'Argo, a warrior framed for the murder of his wife, Chiana, a vivacious thief, Zhaan, a mystical priestess, and Rygel, the dispossessed ruler of an empire) are able to keep one step ahead thanks to the presence of Aeryn Sun, an ex-officer who was exiled after being deemed contaminated by prolonged exposure to the escaped criminals.Season Twoended with Aeryn's tragic death, but begins with her resurrection thanks to the efforts of Zhaan. This sacrifice however, will come with a hefty price.John Crichton is still struggling with the presence of a neural chip in his head, one that manifests in the form of the hybrid Peacekeeper Scorpias (and which allows for some of the craziest scenes in the show, including animation sequences in which John imagines himself chased like something out of a Wile E. Coyote across outer space) who is desperate to get his hands on the information John possesses pertaining to wormhole technology. Along with renegade Peacekeeper Crais, who commands Moya's tempestuous son Talyn, the crew decides to take matters into their own hands to prevent wormholes from being used as weapons in an increasingly volatile galaxy.There are other problems too. In the season's most innovative plotline, Crichton is divided into two identical copies of himself. Doesn't sound like anything you haven't seen a thousand times before I hear you say, but in this case, it's what the writers do with this development that sets ""Farscape"" apart from the usual science-fiction conventions. Forced to split up for their own survival, one Crichton finds himself on board Talyn with Crais, Aeryn, Rygel and Stark, whilst the other remains on Moya with D'Argo, Chiana and Jool. The next few episodes alternate between these two groups, with Aeryn and (one) Crichton finally admitting and consummating their feelings on board Talyn, whilst (the other) Crichton grapples with ongoing disasters aboard Moya.When another tragedy strikes, confusion reigns as the ships reunite and Aeryn tries to sort out just which John she loved, and to whom her heart is owned. We also get some fascinating back-story on Scorpias as to his birth and upbringing, which explains who and what he is without excusing the terrible crimes he's committed, and (in a perfect parallel) learn more about Aeryn's parents and her childhood, brought to the fore when her mother is sent as part of a Peacekeeper retrieval squad.It's not all perfect. Zhaan's absence is sorely felt, and despite their best efforts, the writers never truly manage to replace her. The consensus on Virginia Hey's departure was that it was due to the health problems she faced with the extensive makeup her character required. One cannot blame her for wanting out under such conditions, and she is given a heroic and poignant sendoff. The problems however, were in the writers' attempts to fill the void left in her wake. Along with strong characterization of her own, Zhaan provided spiritual guidance and medical care to the crew, roles that were divided between reoccurring character Stark and the newly introduced Jool, a young woman who was awakened from one of the cryogenic chambers found last season.Though the writers were intelligent enough to realize that an audience would balk at anyone brought in to immediately replace Zhaan, they are a little too self-aware in making Jool antagonistic and obnoxious, to avoid the pit-falls of creating an instantly adored Mary Sue character. It was the writers' way of reassuring the audience that Jool wasn't *meant* to be a likeable addition, particularly since the crew of Moya find her just as irritating, but the situation is compounded by Jool not really being necessary at all. Though she gradually improves over time (the writers' intent was surely to ease the audience into accepting her presence), neither she nor Stark ever really fit in with the group dynamic. They are not particularly endearing characters, and perhaps it would have been wiser to simply forego both of them in favor of working with the ones they already had.Still, in a show with this much scope it's inevitable that not everything will work, and for the most part the tour de force of the season as a whole more than makes up for a couple of missteps. Season three brings back past characters such as Furlow (an engineer played by Australian comedian Magda Szubanski), and newcomer Commandant Grayzer, (played by Rebecca Riggs) a frighteningly cool and detached Peacekeeper official who will have a bigger part to play in the forth season. The two-part season finale in particular is a gripping conclusion to the events that have taken place over the course of the season, combining action, suspense and sacrifice, and providing a fitting send-off to two main characters. The season concludes with a quiet, introspective episode that creates further tension between the core cast and a revelation that will have you scrambling forSeason Four.For my money, series three is the best season of ""Farscape,"" providing the perfect balance between one-shot stories and overarching plots, light-hearted comedy and grandiose drama, character development and shocking change. As the central season between the first half of the show and the final season and concluding mini-series, season three is the lynchpin upon which the entire ""Farscape"" story hangs.",5,"Look Upward,

835691,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002IQFG8,Robert Moore,"[22, 25]","Warning:  Spoilers galore!  Free roaming discussion of the season story arcs!First, before proceeding to heap excessive amounts of praise on this extraordinary season, I have to express my extreme anger at the ongoing refusal of the owner's of the series copyright to make it available to the public at a reasonable or even affordable price.  I do not own this set on DVD and do not plan on doing so as long as they continue pricing it as such absurd levels.  I'll struggle along with my tapes for now.  I'm not angry only because their price means I can't afford it; I am angry because the price keeps a host of would-be fans from discovering this remarkable series.  There is simply no excuse for the way they have gone about the DVD releases for FARSCAPE.  I thoroughly encourage anyone who loves Sci-fi or quality TV to explore this series-I promise you will be delighted with it-but I also encourage everyone to avoid purchasing this set at this price.  As consumers we need to let the companies know that they have a responsibility to make their products available at a reasonable price.Season One of FARSCAPE saw the debut of a new and superb Sci-Fi series.  Season Two saw a marvelous development of all of the main characters, increasingly complex relationships between them, and the expansion of the many story arcs.  But absolutely nothing in either Season One or Season Two prepared viewers for how extraordinary the show would become in Season Three.  This season is unquestionably one of the greatest seasons any series has enjoyed in the history of television, and is in my opinion the greatest season any Sci-fi show has ever enjoyed.  What makes the season so spectacular is that they take a huge number of extraordinary risks, and manage to pull all of them off.  To cover merely some of the highlights, how many shows will begin a season by raising one character from the dead, killing off one of the main characters for good, savagely end a romance between two of the principal characters, create a clone of the show's main character, have the other main character embark on a torrid love affair with one of the clones, kill that clone off, and then savage the potential romance she might have with the other clone?  Then, to make matters even more interesting, kill off two more major characters in the season finale while suddenly and inexplicably inserting a new character from nowhere?  Sound complex?  It is!  But complex can be great when you assemble a team of great writers, great producers, great designers, and great actors.  This was an exceptionally ambitious season, and the miracle was that their ambitions were all realized.Season Two ended with the death of Aeryn Sun and the removal of the implant that Scorpius inserted into John Crichton's brain.  Towards the end of Season Two, John and Aeryn seemed finally to be moving towards the fulfilled romance for which they seemed destined.  In a way, the challenge facing the writers in regard to John and Aeryn reminds me of the famous Monty Python cheese shop sketch.  In that skit, John Cleese enters a cheese shop to buy some cheese.  As he asks for each kind of cheese, none of which the shop possesses, the shop owner tries to concoct a new excuse for why they do not have that particular kind.  The game is to continually invent new excuses for why they don't have any cheese.  Similarly, the writers over nearly four seasons had to create a host of reasons for why Aeryn Sun and John Crichton weren't a couple, all while creating an overwhelming desire in all the show's viewers that they end up with each other.  So, each season presents a series of hurdles for John and Aeryn to leap over, all while maintaining a high degree of interest in one another.  The first hurdle is, of course, Aeryn's death in Season Two, just after she has declared her love for John and at the hand's of John, though temporarily possessed by the personality of Scorpius via the implant.  Aeryn is saved by Zhan, which eventually leads to her own death a few episodes into the season.  I have read varying accounts of the reason why Virginia Hey left the show, though all agree that it was her decision.  The essence seems to be that she was tired of the physical demands that the role made on her.  She not only had to put on blue body make up that generated allergic reactions, but she had to wear contacts that bothered her eyes, and had to shave both her head and her eyebrows.  Zhan leaves the show after a double sacrifice, first saving Aeryn's life but leaving herself in a condition that will eventually lead to death and later in intervening in a situation that costs her life immediately.Shortly after Zhan's death, our heroes encounter a villain who clones individuals to produce food for consumption, leading to our seeing both D'Argo's and Chianna's clones being killed, but John's survives, which sets off a chain of events that colors everything else that happens this season.  After a couple of episodes in which the two Johns make everyone feel exceedingly awkward with their presence, Moya's crew gets splits for several episodes, a few going with Crais on Talon, and the rest on Moya.  Most significantly, the two Johns are split, and Aeryn goes with one of them onto Talon.  Of course, this John and Aeryn finally allow themselves to fall passionately in love, and give it the fullest possible expression, to the extent of the two of them talking of staying together even if John can get back to earth.  Unfortunately, this John dies after extensive exposure to radioactive material, which leaves Aeryn devastated.  When she eventually returns, she finds it impossible to face the other John.  The situation is unprecedented in Sci-fi, in that the man that Aeryn loves has both died and is yet still alive.  It is an impossible situation emotionally, and one can both sympathize with her pain and agonize over John's heart break as he realizes that the woman he loves has given her heart to him, but not this particular ""him"" but the ""other"" him.  The season ends shockingly with an emotional confrontation between John and Aeryn, with their flipping a coin to determine whether she is going to stay on the ship or leave, her departure when the coin doesn't bounce John's way, and finally the shocking revelation that she is pregnant, presumably with the other John's child.  It could have been a terribly silly story arc, but instead it was handled magnificently.  In my opinion, it was one of the truly great seasons in the history of TV.  For my money, during the 2001-2002 television season-with apologies to BUFFY, ANGEL, 24, and ALIAS-it was the best show on TV.There was much, much more to the season.  John's struggle with Scorpius reached epic proportions.  Crais, a villain in Season One and a grudging ally in Seasons Two and Three, dies along with Talon in a heroic death.  D'Argo and Chianna fall apart as lovers.  There are a host of spectacular single episodes.  All in all, it was a remarkable season.  By all means see it, but rent it, borrow it, watch it in rerun.  Just don't encourage the DVD industry by buying it at such absurd prices.",5,As great a season as any in the history of television,1095292800,"09 16, 2004",2004,7148,"['Warning', 'Spoilers', 'galore',

If you are a science fiction fan at all, you will love Farscape.  I am a huge fan of them all, Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Doctor Who, Firefly, if you can name it I've seen it, and loved it.  Farscape surprised me by taking the genre in a new direction.  A ship with no weapons, that was alive, totally rad.  Characters that not only didn't get along, but in some cases, actively  hated each other.  The plot twists and turns were awe inspiring, as was the acting.  Long before BSG was using frak, Farscape had their own slang cuss words.  You can see, in some places, where shows like Firefly got there ideas, and or camera shots.  Farscape is totally underrated, and unheralded as far as I can tell, and you should do all you can to change that!!Season three continues to be all that the first two seasons were, and more.  I think maybe the budget got bigger, because the space battle scenes, and planetary landscapes, as well as the Intro to the show all got better.  The tension between the Peace Keepers, and the Crew of Moya continues to escalate, and the addition of the Scarrans, really makes things boil!!

835706,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0002IQFG8,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[23, 25]","The third season of ""Farscape"" captures the show in its prime; the various story arcs developed here are better than anything that came before. The writing and character development is, for the most part, top notch. Season three features the unusual episode ""Revenging Angel"" where the bulk of the episode occurs in a Looney Tunes Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote type of cartoon with Crichton and D'Argo. ""Infinite Possibilities"" another two parter features one of the Ancients appearing in the form of John's dad. They unlock the secrets of wormhole technology in Crichton's mind to prevent the Scarrans from escaping with a dangerous new weapon.The stand out episodes in my mind that signify this development is the two part """"Into the Lion's Den"" from the conclusion of the season. Crichton agrees in this episode to help Scorpious achieve his dream of wormhole technology. Scorpious plans on using it to develop a weapon of mass destruction that can be used against the Scarions. In return, Crichton and the crew of Moya will receive diplomatic immunity. Things sour very quickly when Crichton realizes what will become of this new found weapon.Picture quality is pretty sharp throughout most of the discs. To answer one question--why isn't this in widescreen? Because it was shot in fullscreen format. It is, however, a high definition transfer. The usual extras are included such as commentary tracks, deleted scenes,interviews with the various actors and behind-the-scenes glimpses of props, the creation of various villains, etc. The only thing missing here is any extra discs or information. ADV essentially took the fans twice here--buying the individual titles cost more than this boxed set does. If you purchased this expecting extras not on those discs, you'd be disappointed.A terrific season of ""Farscape"" only surpassed by season four and the conclusion chapter ""Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars"".",5,Farscape comes into its prime,1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,1906,"['third', 'season', 'Farscape', 'show', 'prime', 'various', 'story', 'arcs', 'developed', 'here', 'are', 'better', 'anything', 'came', 'before', 'writing', 'character', 'development', 'most', 'part', 'top', 'notch', 'Season', 'three', 'unusual', 'episode', 'Revenging', 'Angel', 'where', 'bulk', 'episode', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'Road', 'Runner/Wile', 'E.', 'Coyote', 'type', 'cartoon', 'Crichton', ""D'Argo"", 'Infinite', 'Possibilities', 'two', 'parter', 'one', 'Ancients', 'appearing', 'form', 'John', 'dad', 'unlock', 'secrets', 'wormhole', 'technology', 'Crichton', 'mind', 'prevent', 'Scarrans', 'escaping', 'dangerous', 'new', 'weapon.The', 'stand', 'out', 'episodes', 'mind', 'development', 'two', 'part', 'Lion', 'Den', 'conclusion', 'season', 'Crichton', 'episode', 'help', 'Scorpious', 'achieve', 'dream', 'wormhole', 'technology', 'Scorpious', 'plans', 'using', 'develop', 'weapon', 'mass', 'destruction', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'Scarions', 'return', 'Crichton', 'crew', 'Moya', 'will', 'receive', 'diplomatic', 'immunity', 'Things', 'sour', 'very', 'quickly', 'when', 'Crichton', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'new', 'found', 'weapon.Picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'sharp', 'most', 'discs', 'answer', 'one', 'question', 'why', ""n't"", 'widescreen', 'was', 'shot', 'fullscreen', 'format', 'however', 'high', 'definition', 'transfer', 'usual', 'extras', 'are', 'included', 'such', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'various', 'actors', 'behind-the-scenes', 'glimpses', 'props', 'creation', 'various', 'villains', 'etc', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'here', 'extra', 'discs', 'information', 'ADV', 'essentially', 'took', 'fans', 'twice', 'here', 'buying', 'individual', 'titles', 'cost', 'more', 'boxed', 'set', 'purchased', 'expecting', 'extras', 'not', 'discs', ""'d"", 'be', 'disappointed.A', 'terrific', 'season', 'Farscape', 'only', 'surpassed', 'season', 'four', 'conclusion', 'chapter', 'Farscape', 'Peacekeeper', 'Wars']",N/A
