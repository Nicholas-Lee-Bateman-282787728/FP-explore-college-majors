Normally, it doesn't take much to create a watchable movie around this idea, but not so much here. The acting and dialogue are utterly ridiculous. The first 10 minutes or so of the movie involve a family in a car, with a young (16 y/o-ish) boy almost nonstop harassing another male passenger about him being gay.  About 5 minutes later, that same annoying boy ends up masturbating in the woods. Seriously, who writes this garbage?

There's a hint of dark comedy, the ""Twilight Zone"" feel that pervades almost all the reviews here at Amazon.com, and a clich&eacute;-riddled film that actually works if you set back and enjoy. Apparently given a pretty limited budget, first time co-directors Jean-Baptiste Andrea and Fabrice Canepa have pulled together a horror film that pays homage to a mixture of films in the vein of the Twilight Zone meets Rosemary's Baby. You might also blend in a little ""CHRISTINE"" (ala Stephen King) and then you'll have the general idea.The film stars Ray Wise (SAVANNAH) as Frank Harrington. He's driving his family (wife, two kids - one a punk teenage boy and the other a young adult psychiatrist - and a boyfriend of their daughter's) to a Christmas gathering at his mother-in-law's house. Along the way, though, Frank decides to take a detour, a shortcut, down an old country road, and he does this while everyone else in the car is asleep. And when they awaken, the road seems to go on forever and ever and ever. Hmm. Strange, too, that all of their watches have stopped at 7:30pm.Soon they discover a pretty young lady dressed all in white standing alongside this endless road, and she's cradling a well-swathed baby in her arms. And when they stop to see if she needs help, all hell breaks loose. Their daughter's boyfriend vanishes, and soon a hearse comes slowly trundling by and, as it passes, everyone sees the boyfriend pounding his bloody hands on the rear window. The family jumps back into their car and races after the hearse, only to hit a big speed bump a few miles down the road. Or was that a speed bump? Uh-oh. It was the boyfriend, and he's nearly mangled beyond recognition.Soon the car's occupants/family begin to disappear, almost always after spotting the lady in white. Why doesn't the road ever end? Why are they all being forced into this hearse? Why is this lady in white attached to them somehow? Why does time seemed to have stopped?Like I said earlier, lot's of clich&eacute;-style answer await you, but that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of watching this dark, dark, mildly comedic horror tale.

808818,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B0001K2L4M,Carl Manes,"[3, 3]","DEAD END is an excellent and under appreciated independent Horror film that slipped through the cracks in 2003. It follows a family down an isolated back woods road on Christmas Eve while on their way to their grandmother's house. After a near collision, they continue traveling for hours without passing any other cars or towns. Each time they stop to check the map or use the phone, another member befalls a terrible fate as they continue down the road to no where. Though the reveal is entirely predictable from the beginning of the film, it is the path getting there that is the most enjoyable. The bickering family members reveal multiple layers of emotion and intimate secrets as their predicament grows from bad to worse, establishing rich dialog and rounded characters. Ray Wise and Lin Shaye both provide stellar performances as the parents in what should be considered each of their best roles to date. The dark and desolate setting mixed with chilling sound FX sets a sinister tone as the family's calm demeanor begins to slip away. While there isn't much gore, there are several brilliantly crafted moments of suspense and true horror that are both shocking and unnerving. Considering the majority of the film takes place within the confines of the family vehicle, DEAD END must rely on the strength of its characters to draw the audience in.

I wasn't sure what to expect with this when I rented it, and to be honest I was hoping it would be similar to ""Wrong Turn"", but I wasn't expecting to chuckle throughout the movie. I see plenty of reviews here that are willing to spell out the entire story for you if you want, but I always prefer knowing as little about a movie as possible and just letting the story unfold. So while the story is neat, it's not original. This is just a basic reworking of an old script from the ""Suspense"" radio show that was turned into a ""Twilight Zone"" episode called ""The Hitchhiker"". And the story is done well, but the black humor really carries the film. The bickering family at first is kind of annoying, but as things progress, you find yourself laughing at the comments from the characters, and as their actions continue getting more absurd, you can't help but smile through the last half of the film. And that is not by accident, it's not like watching a horrible B-movie and pulling an MST3K, I am sure the humor was done intentionally. I don't know if I would recommend this film, I know I wouldn't recommend buying it, but it may be worth a rental.

You don't expect a lot from such B movies and then you're pleasantly delighted. The film jumps right into the main thrust of the story without any preliminary introductions. Five people in a car... a father, mother, brother, sister and the sister's boyfriend on a drive to the relatives for Christmas dinner. The father, played in a screen chewing performance by Ray Wise, decides to take a short cut through the woods on a long desolate road that runs for what seems like an eternity. One by one the characters are killed in one bizarre incident after another. The film isn't gory or violent. The horror is more suggested than shown, a wise decision on the part of the filmmakers.What makes this little genre exploitation film stand out is the wild, over the top performances by everyone in the cast and the goofy sensibility of the story. It's really a horror comedy, a strange mixture that rarely works in other movies of this ilk but plays to this film's advantage. It's difficult to take the proceedings seriously and yet the interactions between the actors are funny and casual enough that you can believe these people are a real family along for one of those car trips where you want to strangle each other. As the strange situations and circumstances continue to escalate and the characters lose their lives, we get the big conclusion with a twisted ending that can be interpreted in several ways. I won't spoil it here for anyone of course. This is fun late night entertainment if you're looking for some laughs, cheap scares and an atmosphere replete with dread in the best B movie horror tradition.",3,Truly goofy horror schlock.

I do agree with some of the other reviewers in that Lion's Gate could have done a MUCH better job with this DVD - like giving the US viewers the extras the UK viewers have.  Here, it's straight movie and chapter selections - a directors' commentary would have been at least ONE nice touch!  Could we try it again Lion's Gate and MAYBE get it right.  Just because the directors are unknown Frenchmen doesn't mean we Americans don't want their insight!Anyway, this is a creepy little film about a typically, and at times hilariously, dysfunctional family, the Harringtons (mom, dad, older sister and boyfriend and younger brother), on their way to visit Mrs. Harrington's family on Christmas Eve.  For some reason, the father (the wonderful Ray Wise) decides he's ""bored"" with taking the interstate, as they have done for the past 20 years, and takes the back road.  HUGE mistake, GIGANTIC!!  Strange things start happening - the discovery of a lost woman in white, several deaths, a mysterious hearse that roams the lonely road, the road itself, which never seems to end and the eerie woods.  As Mrs. Harrington (the great Lin Shaye) says, chillingly, at one point, ""Who are all those people in the woods?"".  Made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  As there is no one on this road but this family...and the hearse...and the woman in white.Not an overabundance of gore - this is one of those films that what you THINK you're seeing is much more frightening - but a lot of suspense and ""What the hell...??"".  AND let's not forget the double twist at the end.  But you'll need to watch the movie to see what I mean.It's sad when garbage like the Chucky movies are given wide releases theatrically and little gems like ""Dead End"", which, by the way, has been languishing around since 2002, are sent straight-to-DVD and with little fanfare at that.  If it hadn't been for ""Fangoria"" or ""Rue Morgue"", I never would have known about this movie and enjoyed it so much I now own it.

Though not a bad film, ""Dead End"" just misses the mark.Here's the scoop. Frank Harrington (Ray Wise) is heading to a Christmas Eve dinner at his in-laws house with his wife, son, daughter and her boyfriend. He wanders off the interstate onto a side road he figures might get them there faster. Not only is he wrong, they run into some very odd circumstances that end up causing all of them loads of trouble.This is a really good idea that borrows it's core concept from the movie ""Stay."" There are some great overhead shots of the car riding down this seemingly endless, forested road. It gives the proceedings a very other worldly feel. And as each succeeding incident occurred I became more curious as to what was actually happening. There was a thread there but the film makers didn't show their hand until the very end. The acting was decent enough. Ray Wise is a veteran and he was the best of the lot but I didn't like the way his character was written. He was kind of a nasty guy so I found little to root for. And when he began to unravel it was in an ugly way, so again, who could care. That, and the post script, kept it from gaining the bit more it needed to be a real contender. There were some other parts of the script that added nothing to the overall so they seemed more like filler.This is by no means a bad watch. There is a decent creep factor and things move at a good clip.

Dad is disillusioned and frustrated and sick to death of Christmas Eve at his mother-in-law's house.  He has probably fallen out of love with his wife for many years  now, but stays with her because of the children.  When he snaps at his wife, he immediately feels remorse and most times his apologies take the form of just changing the subject to something else.  Brad, the boyfriend, is new to this family and tries his best to be upbeat and pleasant, after all, he is very much in love with Marian, and he even takes Richard's gay remarks with a grin, at first.  Things soon quiet down, and as they drive through the star filled sky everyone begins to doze off , everyone - including Dad.  He closes his eyes for a moment but that is all it takes.  Suddenly a car horn goes off, his daughter screams, and he awakes abruptly to oncoming head lights.  He barely misses colliding with the oncoming  car.  Or does he?The world doesn't make sense after their near collision.  They are continually confounded by the never ending road, strange noises coming from their radio, cries for help from the cell phone, abandoned ranger's shacks, the appearance of a baby carriage in the road, and the inexplicable black car that seemingly kidnaps one family member after another.  And the woman in white.I have watched this movie several times now and it seems to be like the movie ""A Christmas Story"", only if it was written by Stephen King.  The humor is wicked and brilliant, and the chilling moments are truly creepy.  It took several viewings to really listen to the dialogue in the beginning and realize how it relates to the revelations of each family member by the end of the movie.  Intelligent stuff.  One of my favorite lines:""Darling, is the phone not working?""""No, Laura, I forgot the number for 9-1-1.""The mother is played by Lin Shaye, who is incredibly funny and talented and versatile in this.  The father is played perfectly by Ray Wise.  Richard is played by the hilarious and cute, Mick Cain.  Marian is played by Alexandra Holden, and Brad is portrayed by Billy Asher.  Great performances by everyone, great screen writing, and truly chilling.  I recommend this one highly.",4,Great movie up ahead,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,2998,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'kids', 'case', 'brother', 'sister', 'Richard', 'Marian', 'boyfriend', 'Brad', 'get', 'car', 'head', 'Grandma', 'Mom', 'obligatory', 'chocolate', 'pumpkin', 'pie', 'smells', 'ass', 'Richard', 'Mom', 'likes', 'sing', 'songs', 'car', 'trips', 'offer', 'coffee', 'husband', 'who', 'let', 'anyone', 'else', 'drive', 'Richard', 'stage', 'where', 'everything', 'parents', 'do', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'CD', 'chance', 'one', 'Richard', 'wrath', 'especially', 'sister', 'boyfriend', 'Brad', 'whom', 'Richard', 'convinced', 'gay', 'Marian', 'sister', 'not', 'mouthy', 'disillusioned', 'brother', 'can', 'still', 'find', 'fun', 'sing', 'songs', 'car', 'parents', 'Dad', 'Richard', '30', 'years', 'Dad', 'disillusioned', 'frustrated', 'sick', 'death', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'mother-in-law', 'house', 'probably', 'fallen', 'love', 'wife', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'because', 'children', 'When', 'wife', 'immediately', 'remorse', 'most', 'times', 'apologies', 'take', 'form', 'just', 'changing', 'subject', 'something', 'else', 'Brad', 'boyfriend', 'new', 'family', 'best', 'be', 'upbeat', 'pleasant', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'Marian', 'even', 'Richard', 'gay', 'remarks', 'grin', 'first', 'Things', 'soon', 'quiet', 'down', 'drive', 'star', 'filled', 'sky', 'everyone', 'doze', 'off', 'everyone', 'including', 'Dad', 'eyes', 'moment', 'Suddenly', 'car', 'horn', 'off', 'daughter', 'screams', 'abruptly', 'oncoming', 'head', 'lights', 'barely', 'colliding', 'oncoming', 'car', 'world', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'near', 'collision', 'are', 'continually', 'confounded', 'never', 'ending', 'road', 'strange', 'noises', 'coming', 'radio', 'cries', 'help', 'cell', 'phone', 'abandoned', 'ranger', 'shacks', 'appearance', 'baby', 'carriage', 'road', 'inexplicable', 'black', 'car', 'seemingly', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'woman', 'white.I', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'now', 'be', 'movie', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'only', 'was', 'written', 'Stephen', 'King', 'humor', 'wicked', 'brilliant', 'chilling', 'moments', 'are', 'truly', 'creepy', 'took', 'several', 'viewings', 'really', 'listen', 'dialogue', 'beginning', 'realize', 'how', 'revelations', 'family', 'member', 'end', 'movie', 'Intelligent', 'stuff', 'One', 'favorite', 'lines', 'Darling', 'phone', 'not', 'working', 'No', 'Laura', 'forgot', 'number', '9-1-1', 'mother', 'played', 'Lin', 'Shaye', 'who', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'talented', 'versatile', 'father', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'Richard', 'played', 'hilarious', 'cute', 'Mick', 'Cain', 'Marian', 'played', 'Alexandra', 'Holden', 'Brad', 'portrayed', 'Billy', 'Asher', 'Great', 'performances', 'everyone', 'great', 'screen', 'writing', 'truly', 'chilling', 'recommend', 'one', 'highly']",N/A

I gave this U.S. DVD release only 3 stars because Lion's Gate (whom I had high hopes for) seemed to not care about this release at all.  This is a full-frame, no-frills release and at the time of this review, a $24.98 retail price??? That's ridiculous.In the U.K. they get a widescreen edition, with a 30-minute ""making of"" featurette, deleted scenes, and trailers.  This U.S. edition is a joke, and insults those that put together an amazingly trippy film about a family's Christmas Eve drive through an otherworldly scenic route.  Lion's Gate has also insulted those of us that appreciate a film as it was meant to be seen, even if it's not a classy drama but rather a wonderfully intense, scary, and funny thriller.This is not your typical ""horror"" film.  Thanks to the European talent behind the writing and direction, this transcends the genre.  Anyone could make a film about a family facing death and strangers on an isolated road, but Jean-Baptiste Andrea and Fabrice Canepa have come up with something you'll be thoroughly entertained by.  Plenty of suspense, some grossness, and humor blend quite well.Too bad Lion's Gate just chucked this one out without a care...looks like I'll have to get my hands on a European copy and get an all-regions DVD player.Sure, get this DVD if it's the only way you can get to see this film, but it's only a taste of what the whole experience COULD be!",3,"Excellent film, but it seems Lion's Gate didn't give a darn.",1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,1515,"['Dead', 'End', 'one', 'films', 'joy', 'discover', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', '5-star', 'one', 'gave', 'U.S.', 'DVD', 'release', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'whom', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'seemed', 'not', 'care', 'release', 'full-frame', 'no-frills', 'release', 'time', 'review', '24.98', 'retail', 'price', 'ridiculous.In', 'U.K.', 'get', 'widescreen', 'edition', '30-minute', 'making', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailers', 'U.S.', 'edition', 'joke', 'insults', 'put', 'together', 'amazingly', 'trippy', 'film', 'family', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'drive', 'otherworldly', 'scenic', 'route', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'also', 'insulted', 'appreciate', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'even', 'not', 'classy', 'drama', 'rather', 'wonderfully', 'intense', 'scary', 'funny', 'thriller.This', 'not', 'typical', 'horror', 'film', 'Thanks', 'European', 'talent', 'writing', 'direction', 'genre', 'Anyone', 'could', 'make', 'film', 'family', 'facing', 'death', 'strangers', 'isolated', 'road', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Andrea', 'Fabrice', 'Canepa', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'something', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'Plenty', 'suspense', 'grossness', 'humor', 'blend', 'quite', 'well.Too', 'bad', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'just', 'chucked', 'one', 'out', 'care', ""'ll"", 'have', 'get', 'hands', 'European', 'copy', 'get', 'all-regions', 'DVD', 'player.Sure', 'get', 'DVD', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'see', 'film', 'only', 'taste', 'what', 'whole', 'experience', 'COULD', 'be']",N/A
808833,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B0001K2L4M,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[4, 9]","The movie ""Dead End"" is aptly named, but not for the reason the filmmakers envisioned.  ""Dead End"" is about a family driving to a relative's house for Christmas on Christmas Eve and the Father of the family takes an ill-advised shortcut and strange things start happening.  The acting is sufficient for the first half of the film, but once terrible things start happening to the family, the ineptitude of the acting shows as well.There is no doubt about it that ""Dead End"" starts off very well and the creators of this film were clearly on to something good here.  For that reason, this movie deserves some credit.  However, that being said, the screenwriter pretty much ruins the film with the ending.  I agree with some of the other reviewers regarding this flick and that is that the movie is effective as a horror movie and really keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat, but the movie ends at a ""dead end"" that pretty much destroys all of the horror and suspense the movie built up.  The element of mystery, the unknown, evil and the supernatural were all present in this movie and this created horror, but when you basically trash the foundation of the horror, you destroy the movie's credibility...that's what the audience gets here in this movie.""Dead End"" reminds me of modern day horror films that fail to follow up on and/or sustain the horror from the movie's beginning to the end...such is the case with ""Dead End"".  In conclusion, ""Dead End"" starts out great and builds suspense and horror but crashes into a ""dead end"" which elminates and erases any elements of horror, mystery and suspense the movie was able to sustain and create.  You could not create a worse ending to this movie.  Why did they do this???  I'm sure I don't know, but my gut feeling is that this is just part and parcel of today's intrinsically flawed modern horror films.  Still, for all its faults, ""Dead End"" is a very dark movie about death that I recommend with some trepidation.  What the hell?  It's a helluva lot better than ""Reeker"".",2,"2.5 STARS: When you've got something good, go with it for Pete's sake!!!!",1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,2028,"['movie', 'Dead', 'End', 'aptly', 'named', 'not', 'reason', 'filmmakers', 'envisioned', 'Dead', 'End', 'family', 'driving', 'relative', 'house', 'Christmas', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Father', 'family', 'ill-advised', 'shortcut', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'acting', 'sufficient', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'once', 'terrible', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'family', 'ineptitude', 'acting', 'doubt', 'Dead', 'End', 'very', 'well', 'creators', 'film', 'were', 'clearly', 'something', 'good', 'here', 'reason', 'movie', 'credit', 'However', 'being', 'said', 'screenwriter', 'pretty', 'much', 'film', 'ending', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'regarding', 'flick', 'movie', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie', 'really', 'keeps', 'viewer', 'edge', 'seat', 'movie', 'dead', 'end', 'pretty', 'much', 'horror', 'suspense', 'movie', 'built', 'up', 'element', 'mystery', 'unknown', 'evil', 'supernatural', 'were', 'present', 'movie', 'created', 'horror', 'when', 'basically', 'trash', 'foundation', 'horror', 'destroy', 'movie', 'credibility', 'what', 'audience', 'here', 'movie', 'Dead', 'End', 'modern', 'day', 'horror', 'films', 'fail', 'follow', 'up', 'and/or', 'sustain', 'horror', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', 'such', 'case', 'Dead', 'End', 'conclusion', 'Dead', 'End', 'out', 'great', 'builds', 'suspense', 'horror', 'crashes', 'dead', 'end', 'elements', 'horror', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'sustain', 'create', 'could', 'not', 'create', 'worse', 'ending', 'movie', 'Why', 'did', 'do', ""'m"", 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'gut', 'feeling', 'just', 'part', 'parcel', 'today', 'intrinsically', 'flawed', 'modern', 'horror', 'films', 'Still', 'faults', 'Dead', 'End', 'very', 'dark', 'movie', 'death', 'recommend', 'trepidation', 'What', 'hell', 'helluva', 'lot', 'better', 'Reeker']",N/A

It is now Christmas Eve and it is very dark out there driving on the road.  It's a trip they take every year, but this year will be different.  Traditionally, they travel on the Interstate, but Frank has decided to take a backroad as a shortcut.  he won't let anyone else drive and he is getting very sleepy.  He nods off and a car is coming right towards them.  Marion screams and the father wakes up just in time.  No one is injured and the car is all right, but the family has no idea where they are now. The film takes another weird turn when Frank sees a woman in white by the road.  he stops to pick her up.  She has a laceration on her forehead and she is in shock.  marion with an attitude decides to get out of the car and walk the rest of the way.  The woman in white enters the car while she is in shock.This is just the first 10 minutes of the film.  This film has many twists and turns like the road itself.This film is very engrossing.

Dad has taken a short cut off the highway and falls asleep at the wheel. He wakes up just in time to avoid a collision... or does he? At this point, strange things start to happen and the road seems to go on endlessly no matter how far they drive. Members of their little party start to die and the tension mounts, but you'll have to see what happens for yourself, I won't give away any more of the plot.Modern horror movies often try to scare us by murdering as many people as possible in the most grisly fashion imaginable, displayed in loving detail on the screen. Thankfully, the makers of Dead End took a radically different approach. Put a family in a car at night. Mix lots of dysfunctional family humor with a series of bizarre events, a road that literally never ends, and some simple but creepy atmosphere, and then watch what happens.  The result is a movie that is laugh out loud funny more times than most comedies and provides some genuinely creepy scares.It's pretty clear that there was not much of a budget to work with.  Ray Wise, as the father, was the only actor I recognized but the entire cast did a great job.  The writing, especially the funny dialog, is razor sharp.  This movie also makes excellent use of few scary audio effects to get scares... again this was probably dictated by the budget due to the expense of visual effects but it is very effective.  Many directors end up making a cheap looking bad film when confronted with a limited budget.  Here, we get a movie that chose to limit its scope but does everything it attempts very well.Watching Dead End is definitely a pleasure. I've shown it to a half dozen other people so far and every one of them has loved it.

Indeed, before you can say what's that thing in the dark, the Harringtons are thrust forward into Twilight Zone territory where the consequences are deadly.

Apparently that world premiere of the film had people gasping in awe and speculating about the ending way after the final credits rolled.  I'm glad Lions Gate has chosen to release this on DVD and yes indeed it is an excellent little indie film although I am a little disappointed at the absolute lack of features.  Nothing, zilch, nada.  You get the movie, chapter selections and that's all folks.  Then again maybe it's best that we don't get special features or commentary explaining the movie's meanings and its ending; it's a lot of fun trying to figure out and philosophize on our own.The premise is way simple: A married couple and their teenaged children hit the road to attend a family Christmas party.  They make the trip every year but this time they're running a little late and the father chooses to take a short-cut.  Big mistake.  They find themselves on a never-ending road where time has stopped, there are no other cars anywhere, and horrific things keep occurring at every juncture.  And the end of the road is nowhere in sight...""Dead End"" is low-budget stuff and it shows.  The music score consists of a generic little techno-ish beat; the cinematography consists of a dark road; the acting is not particularly good nor are any of the characters likeable or developed sufficiently.  Yet somehow despite all this we still have a good movie.  The strength of this film is the taking of a very simplistic premise and finding creative ways to sustain interest throughout.  As the movie rolls on, we can't wait to see what atrocity/absurdity awaits on the road and as viewers we are enveloped in the claustrophobic nightmare that the director is creating.There is no wasted time here as the movie's opening scene is of the family in the car and from then on the action barely lets go, making the most of the 83-minute run time.  Unfortunately I didn't understand the ending but then again I guess a strange nonsensical ending is to be expected in such a weird picture.

What starts off as any other Christmas family road trip, ends up as a night of pure terror.  The Harringtons seem like a typical family, a husband (Frank), wife (Laura), and their two children (Richard and Marion) on a typical family vacation.  The Harringtons spend every Christmas at their maternal grandmother's home and spend hours traveling to her home on an annual basis, but this year's journey is not the same as their past ones.  The trip starts off different in the first place, since Frank (the father, played by Ray Wise) decided to take a different route.  This route is supposed to greatly cut down on their travel time, but instead it ends up being a route that they should have never traveled.The problems begin when Frank falls asleep at the wheel, almost driving head on into another vehicle on the opposite lane of the highway.  Immediately afterward, Frank notices a woman dressed in white holding a baby on the side of the street.  The Harringtons offer the woman assistance by giving the woman a ride.  Unfortunately, there is not enough room in the vehicle for all of them, so the daughter (Marion) offers to walk.  The family stops at a station to call for assistance, but to no avail, seeing as the building is abandoned.  During this time, Brad (Marion's boyfriend) is left alone with the woman and her baby.  The events that follow are sure to shock the audience beyond belief.  One by one the family is being killed off, each time a black vehicle is seen carrying off the victim as they scream helplessly.  Their bodies later turn up mangled beyond recognition.The audience begins to witness how slowly each member of the family loses their sanity as the road they are traveling on appears to have no end in sight.  Driving for hours on end is getting the family nowhere, but each time they stop the car someone ends up dead.  It's a predicament that is deadly either way.  The suspense builds every time the vehicle stops, giving the audience the feeling of the upcoming events that are bound to unfold.  The film does a great job of implying who will be next on the list through the subtle hints provided with the characters' action and slow loss of sanity.  Each time it seems like the most vulnerable is the one to go.The pacing is incredible, never having the scares too far about, and never having them too close together either.  The story is given plenty of time to develop, giving insight on the family's personal matters such as affairs, and other family secrets that have long been hidden.  The ending is a true shocker, leaving the audience asking several questions.  Did these events even occur, or were they all imagined?  The last scene alone makes you question the events of the entire film, leaving you cringing in terror, sending goosebumps down your spine.  Truly remarkable.

I was totally caught off guard by the humor.  Most horror movies either have no humor, or the humor is poorly executed.  I expected the same here, until I found myself busting out laughing at several scenes.  The ""do you have to suck on the bottle like that?"" line starting things rolling and there were several others that elicited more than just a chuckle.But a horror movie's main task is to frighten and scare you.  This does that as well.  Driving down a deserted road late at night makes for a nice setting.  And as the events start happening to this family you can't help but feel their despair.  Another thing I like is how they slowly start breaking down psychologically and turn on each other (some of the funniest lines come out here).  And then you get the ending, which didn't turn me off like it did so many others.Overall an enjoyable ride that I'd gladly take again and again.",5,Dead End is no dead end.,1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,990,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'flick', 'very', 'deftly', 'combined', 'comedy', 'horror', 'easy', 'task', 'was', 'totally', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'humor', 'Most', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'humor', 'humor', 'poorly', 'executed', 'expected', 'same', 'here', 'found', 'busting', 'out', 'laughing', 'several', 'scenes', 'do', 'have', 'suck', 'bottle', 'line', 'starting', 'things', 'rolling', 'were', 'several', 'others', 'elicited', 'more', 'just', 'chuckle.But', 'horror', 'movie', 'main', 'task', 'frighten', 'scare', 'as', 'well', 'Driving', 'down', 'deserted', 'road', 'late', 'night', 'nice', 'setting', 'events', 'start', 'happening', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'despair', 'thing', 'like', 'how', 'slowly', 'start', 'breaking', 'down', 'psychologically', 'turn', 'other', 'funniest', 'lines', 'come', 'out', 'here', 'then', 'get', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'others.Overall', 'enjoyable', 'ride', ""'d"", 'gladly', 'take', 'again', 'again']",N/A

Dead End plays a somewhat of an extended episode of Twilight Zone or Night Gallery.  This is on the surface a horror film but at its core a clever black comedy aimed at dysfunctional families.The Harrington family is on their way to a Christmas eve gathering at a relative's home.  The father, Frank, (Ray Wise) decides to take a short cut down a lonely, deserted forest road much to the annoyance of his prim and proper wife Laura (Lin Shaye).  In the back is pot-smoking, smart-ass son Richard (Mick Cain) Daughter Marion (Alexandra Holden) and her boyfriend Brad (Billy Asher).Soon they see a woman in white wandering the road carrying a baby.  They stop to pick her up and see if they can help.  she disappears when they stop at small roadside shack along with boyfriend Brad.  Brad is then seen screaming in the back of a slow moving, 50's era black car.  Soon afterward Brad's body is found mutilated in the road.Panic ensues in the Harrington family as they try to find help but they pass no other cars and reach no towns along the seemingly endless road.  At every point they stop, someone else disappers only to be seen in the black car and then dead afterwards.  Panic sets as the stress brings out buried secrets in a darkly humorous way from the various family members.  Marion reveals she's pregnant, Richard that he smokes pot, and wife laura that she had an affair and Richard is not her husband's son.  Things escalate as mom Laura descends into madness and begins to see people along the road causing her to leap from the speeding car.Dead End is a nice little direct-to-video film.  Certainly a cut above others of its ilk.  Director jean-Baptiste Andrea does a deft job at slowly building the tension between family members and having all of their dark secrets revealed on what's supposed to be a happy night of celebration.  The comedic elements are subtle but quite funny such as when Marion reveals she's pregnant to her stunned parents, son Richard blurts out of the blue, ""I smoke pot!""There's a lot of nice little touchs like that in this movie.

The Harrington's, father Frank (Ray Wise), mother Laura (Lin Shaye), son Richard (Mick Cain), daughter Marion (Alexandra Holden) and her boyfriend Brad (Billy Asher), are onboard the family SUV headed to a relative's for Christmas.  Darkness has fallen, and Frank has taken a detour onto an unfamiliar road, when he dozes off at the wheel.  Waking up in a panic, Frank swerves and brings the car to a stop, having apparently just avoided a head on crash with another car that fades into the night.Shaken but apparently unhurt, the group resumes their journey travelling through the lonely woods, until Frank sees a woman in a white dress and pulls over.  Carrying a baby, the woman (Amber Smith) is taken into the car, and for some strange reason, Marion decides to get out and walk, while her family continues ahead.  There is no cell phone service (surprise!), and Frank stops at a shack, looking for a phone.  While the group is separated, they hear Brad scream.  Up the road, Marion sees Brad trying to escape from the rear of a black hearse, as it drives by.  The mysterious woman in white has vanished, and with Marion back onboard, the group makes a gruesome discovery.  In a panic, they continue driving through the endless wilderness, looking for the next town, some kind of help, or perhaps their destiny.Situated on what becomes a very familiar road, Dead End works in part, because it successfully establishes a connection with the Harrington family.  The connection grows stronger over time, as you begin to relate to the characters. Written and directed by Jean Baptiste Andrea (The Big Nothing) and Fabrice Canepa, the film is nicely paced, as the uneasy atmosphere and tension that occurs once bad things start happening, is sustained by the weird and violent events that follow.  The characters have few options but to continue on, and the story flows along smoothly, weaving in dark wicked humor, and some intimate character elements, that adds to the perception that these are real people.  The dialog sounds natural, and the acting is very believable.  Ray Wise (Twin Peaks), Alexandra Holden (Wishcraft), and Lin Shaye, are particularly outstanding.Saying much more would deprive first time viewers of the opportunity to enjoy the film properly, as Dead End ends with a twist.  While probably making its strongest impact the first time around, it is a well-crafted tale with solid performances that stands up well to repeated viewings.  There are no big scares, but the spooky atmosphere and dark humor make for an unusual and grim ride.

You might not think that a low-budget picture with Lin Shaye, `Magda' of `There's Something About Mary,' could be scary in the true sense of the term - I didn't either - but it really is.It is Christmas Eve, and one family with a boyfriend of their sister are on the ride to their in-laws. It's cold and dark outside, and the road is `the short-cut,' a deserted road where they can see nothing but the forest surrounding the rushing car. But soon the father behind the wheel finds someone is walking in the woods, and he pulls over the car. What he found is a lady in white holding something in her arms.Naturally he should ask the question, to which she doesn't answer. Consequently he gives her a lift, which is a big mistake, well, but you know it is Christmas Eve. However, since that moment, many unaccountable and horrible things start to happen to the travelers, who are totally lost in the middle of nowhere. An old black car silently vanishing into the dark, mutilated dead body, and the long road that must lead to `Marcott.' But this road seems very long. Actually it might have no end.Jean-Baptiste Andrea and Fabrice Canepa, writer and director team from France must be David Lynch fans - the star is Ray Wise (`Twin Peaks' ) and some images remind us of Lynch's `Lost Highway' and even `The Elephant Man.' But the entire film is made according to the rules of traditional horrors with truly atmospheric images. The directors refuse to use now familiar tricks of horror films such as sudden big noises, and when they use sound, its effect is very creepy.`Dead End' has some darkly funny scenes, without which the film could be still good, or even better. Some viewers say that the screenplay is rather clich&eacute;d, and right, when someone takes a short-cut instead of highway, it means a trouble, like many other previously made horrors implied. When he encounters someone on the darkly-lit lane and stops the car, it only worsens the situation. No American drivers would not stop and give `The Lady in White' (that's the name of her role) a lift while traveling at night on the lonely road. Ray Wise does all these things, to which we must turn a blind eye.Luckily, the visual flair of the directors makes up for those improbable scenes and corny dialogues. And when they make good use of the visuals, the film offers very macabre feeling and really scary moments that few horror films can do these days. Despite its too familiar story, 'Dead End' is worth watching for these moments.",3,(3.5 STARS) Lost in the Dark: Well-Made Horror with Some Genuinely Creepy Moments,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,2647,"['find', 'nothing', 'new', 'Dead', 'End', 'what', 'find', 'still', 'superbly-directed', 'mostly', 'thrilling', 'horror', 'film', 'brooding', 'images', 'might', 'not', 'think', 'low-budget', 'picture', 'Lin', 'Shaye', 'Magda', 'Something', 'Mary', 'could', 'be', 'scary', 'true', 'sense', 'term', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'one', 'family', 'boyfriend', 'sister', 'are', 'ride', 'in-laws', 'cold', 'dark', 'outside', 'road', 'short-cut', 'deserted', 'road', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'nothing', 'forest', 'surrounding', 'rushing', 'car', 'soon', 'father', 'wheel', 'someone', 'walking', 'woods', 'car', 'What', 'found', 'lady', 'white', 'holding', 'something', 'arms.Naturally', 'should', 'ask', 'question', ""n't"", 'answer', 'Consequently', 'lift', 'big', 'mistake', 'well', 'know', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'However', 'moment', 'many', 'unaccountable', 'horrible', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'travelers', 'who', 'are', 'totally', 'lost', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'old', 'black', 'car', 'silently', 'vanishing', 'dark', 'mutilated', 'dead', 'body', 'long', 'road', 'must', 'lead', 'Marcott', 'road', 'very', 'long', 'Actually', 'might', 'have', 'end.Jean-Baptiste', 'Andrea', 'Fabrice', 'Canepa', 'writer', 'director', 'team', 'France', 'must', 'be', 'David', 'Lynch', 'fans', 'star', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'images', 'remind', 'Lynch', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'even', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'entire', 'film', 'made', 'according', 'rules', 'traditional', 'horrors', 'truly', 'atmospheric', 'images', 'directors', 'refuse', 'use', 'now', 'familiar', 'tricks', 'horror', 'films', 'such', 'sudden', 'big', 'noises', 'when', 'use', 'sound', 'effect', 'very', 'creepy.', 'Dead', 'End', 'darkly', 'funny', 'scenes', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'still', 'good', 'even', 'better', 'viewers', 'say', 'screenplay', 'rather', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'right', 'when', 'someone', 'short-cut', 'instead', 'highway', 'trouble', 'many', 'other', 'previously', 'made', 'horrors', 'implied', 'When', 'someone', 'darkly-lit', 'lane', 'car', 'only', 'situation', 'American', 'drivers', 'would', 'not', 'stop', 'give', 'Lady', 'White', 'name', 'role', 'lift', 'traveling', 'night', 'lonely', 'road', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'things', 'must', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye.Luckily', 'visual', 'flair', 'directors', 'up', 'improbable', 'scenes', 'corny', 'dialogues', 'when', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'visuals', 'film', 'very', 'macabre', 'feeling', 'really', 'scary', 'moments', 'few', 'horror', 'films', 'can', 'do', 'days', 'too', 'familiar', 'story', ""'Dead"", 'End', 'worth', 'watching', 'moments']",N/A

Every attempt to escape from the road ends in failure as one of the family members is captured by some unseen assailant and carried off in a black hearse.The movie is surprisingly stylish, and does a great job creating tension without explicitly showing gore.  The acting in the movie was excellent.  Alexandra Holden especially shines as Marion Harrington, the psychologist daughter, but the entire caste does a great job.Attention to subtle details helps increase the creepiness factor, as, for example, the windows of the car become increasingly fogged through the movie.  This creates a claustrophobic feel in which the characters become increasingly isolated from the world outside and any possible salvation.  There are many such subtle factors that are well throughout and executed.Over all, this movie was entertaining, but it does drag at times as inane dialogue acts as filler before the film's action sequences.  The dialogue is really not too bad, and quite possibly reflects the sorts of things that a dysfunctional family might say to each other in the implausible case that they found themselves in this situation.  However, the characters aren't really strong enough the make the dialogue interesting.

The cover seemed creepy and the description interesting so i brought it home. I've seen literally hundreds of horror films, it's my favorite genre. As of late films in genre are not aging well. The idea of more gore, more violence, more special effects are consuming the idea of film maker's instead of actually making an effort to SCARE the audience. There is a big difference between a movie being disturbing and gory and actually SCARY(which should be the intent of EVERY horror director/writer).I won't go into the story of the plot as there are several discriptions for you to read here. But, I will tell you that the film is ALITTLE slow. And not much happens, but trust me when I tell you...you don't need it to. This film is moody, creepy, dark, and most of all contains its fair share of decent scares. Also the screen writer did a fantastic job. The plot is a little predictable but the subplots are utterly fantastic. It's amazing what these people did with an obviously low budget. Even the performances are really something special. Lin Shaye in particular gives a simply wonderful performance as the mother. Also, I'm not a fan IN THE LEAST of horror films that try to mix in comedy. It rarely works. Very rarely. And if you're like me...you believe that comedy really has no place in horror unless you're trying to cheese it up even further than most directors today are doing. This film is a slight exception...it's comedy is based within its story line (people going crazy and saying crazy things that to us is pretty funny but to the characters isn't at all.) Anyway, it works. The ending is...interesting...it does come together nicely but its a bit less than you would have expected. Nevertheless that doesn't prevent this from being one of the best independant horror films I've seen in literally years. I do have to say that the price is a little high...Is it perfect? No. But it's close. The most important thing is you'll actually get to see a movie that has some scares and decent storyline. Don't miss this film. You shouldn't be disappointed.",4,"The ""almost perfect"" horror film...",1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,2157,"['randomly', 'found', 'little', 'gem', 'movie', 'casually', 'searching', 'video', 'store', 'cover', 'seemed', 'creepy', 'description', 'interesting', 'so', 'i', 'brought', 'home', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'horror', 'films', 'favorite', 'genre', 'late', 'films', 'genre', 'are', 'not', 'aging', 'well', 'idea', 'more', 'gore', 'more', 'violence', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'consuming', 'idea', 'film', 'maker', 'instead', 'actually', 'making', 'effort', 'SCARE', 'audience', 'big', 'difference', 'movie', 'being', 'disturbing', 'gory', 'actually', 'SCARY', 'should', 'be', 'intent', 'EVERY', 'horror', 'director/writer', '.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'story', 'plot', 'are', 'several', 'discriptions', 'read', 'here', 'will', 'tell', 'film', 'ALITTLE', 'slow', 'not', 'much', 'happens', 'trust', 'when', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'film', 'moody', 'creepy', 'dark', 'most', 'fair', 'share', 'decent', 'scares', 'Also', 'screen', 'writer', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'plot', 'little', 'predictable', 'subplots', 'are', 'utterly', 'fantastic', 'amazing', 'what', 'people', 'did', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'Even', 'performances', 'are', 'really', 'something', 'special', 'Lin', 'Shaye', 'particular', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'mother', 'Also', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'IN', 'THE', 'LEAST', 'horror', 'films', 'try', 'mix', 'comedy', 'rarely', 'Very', 'rarely', ""'re"", 'believe', 'comedy', 'really', 'place', 'horror', ""'re"", 'trying', 'cheese', 'up', 'even', 'further', 'most', 'directors', 'today', 'are', 'doing', 'film', 'slight', 'exception', 'comedy', 'based', 'story', 'line', 'people', 'going', 'crazy', 'saying', 'crazy', 'things', 'pretty', 'funny', 'characters', ""n't"", 'Anyway', 'ending', 'interesting', 'come', 'together', 'nicely', 'bit', 'less', 'would', 'have', 'expected', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'independant', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'literally', 'years', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'price', 'little', 'high', 'perfect', 'No', 'close', 'most', 'important', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'get', 'see', 'movie', 'scares', 'decent', 'storyline', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

808883,A34HYQ9BQZPE78,B0001K2L4M,William Dorfer,"[0, 0]","The French are well-known for making great horror films such as ""Inside"" and ""High Tension."". However, ""Dead End"", also from French directors, is a different affair altogether. Weaving together dark and yet hilarious humor with supernatural horror, ""Dead End"" will take you in a ride into darkness. The movie stars a family on the way to their relatives for Christmas, and are traveling alone in the dark. Classic isolation? Check. Although the film can generally be considered a supernatural horror movie, the film generally doesn't utilize a tremendous supply of special effects. A lot of the terror is based around the characters, the situation and the surroundings, all of which get more tightly knit as the movie progresses. Things get creepier and creepier with a mysterious lady and her dead baby, the family getting picked off one by one, and a mysterious car that appears after a death.I've always said a lot about the movie so I don't want to say much more. However, I will say that the ending twist was excellent; brilliantly done and it made a lot of sense, unlike some horror movies that seem to try to force an ending. Altogether, there isn't all that much gore in this movie, but the acting, script and atmosphere are all excellent. This is definitely the type of film to watch alone at night, so enjoy! Thanks for the time, and peace.",5,Dead End will take you down a dark and chilling road,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,1350,"['French', 'are', 'well-known', 'making', 'great', 'horror', 'films', 'such', 'Inside', 'High', 'Tension.', 'However', 'Dead', 'End', 'also', 'French', 'directors', 'different', 'affair', 'altogether', 'Weaving', 'together', 'dark', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'humor', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'Dead', 'End', 'will', 'take', 'ride', 'darkness', 'movie', 'family', 'way', 'relatives', 'Christmas', 'are', 'traveling', 'alone', 'dark', 'Classic', 'isolation', 'Check', 'film', 'can', 'generally', 'be', 'considered', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'movie', 'film', 'generally', ""n't"", 'utilize', 'tremendous', 'supply', 'special', 'effects', 'lot', 'terror', 'based', 'characters', 'situation', 'surroundings', 'get', 'more', 'tightly', 'knit', 'movie', 'Things', 'get', 'creepier', 'creepier', 'mysterious', 'lady', 'dead', 'baby', 'family', 'getting', 'picked', 'one', 'one', 'mysterious', 'car', 'death.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'said', 'lot', 'movie', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'ending', 'twist', 'was', 'excellent', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'made', 'lot', 'sense', 'horror', 'movies', 'seem', 'try', 'force', 'ending', 'Altogether', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'gore', 'movie', 'acting', 'script', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'excellent', 'definitely', 'type', 'film', 'watch', 'alone', 'night', 'so', 'enjoy', 'Thanks', 'time', 'peace']",N/A

My review is based on the Australian DVD release of 6 October.DEAD END focusses on a family who are travelling on christmas eve to visit their family.  They have been taking the same route for 20 years, but on this occassion, the father decides to take a different route.  Big mistake!  From then on, nothing goes right.  It's hard to take the characters seriously as they seem to overeact to everything, but by the end of the film you will understand why.  The film contains an interesting twist that I cannot give away.Worth seeing if you enjoy films with a bit of tension and horror thrown in.  I was a tad disappointed in the film overall, it just got too annoying for its own good in parts.DEAD END Region 4 DVD contains talent profiles, trailers for other movies, and a 16:9 widescreen transfer.",3,An interesting twist,1097280000,"10 9, 2004",2004,882,"['DEAD', 'END', 'film', 'seemed', 'skip', 'cinemas', 'head', 'straight', 'video', 'review', 'based', 'Australian', 'DVD', 'release', '6', 'October.DEAD', 'END', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'travelling', 'christmas', 'eve', 'visit', 'family', 'have', 'been', 'taking', 'same', 'route', '20', 'years', 'occassion', 'father', 'take', 'different', 'route', 'Big', 'mistake', 'then', 'nothing', 'right', 'hard', 'take', 'characters', 'seriously', 'seem', 'overeact', 'everything', 'end', 'film', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'interesting', 'twist', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'away.Worth', 'seeing', 'enjoy', 'films', 'bit', 'tension', 'horror', 'thrown', 'was', 'tad', 'disappointed', 'film', 'overall', 'just', 'got', 'too', 'annoying', 'own', 'good', 'parts.DEAD', 'END', 'Region', '4', 'DVD', 'contains', 'talent', 'profiles', 'trailers', 'other', 'movies', '16:9', 'widescreen', 'transfer']",N/A
