Smith ""Movies N' Music""","[0, 0]","I got this Monarch of the Glen series 5 & 6 for my Wife's birthday this year ( it started in Mid February and will come to a close Mid March when her last gift arrives).She has been a LONG TIME FAN of this series on PBS. I have found myself getting involved in some of the episodes ( which for a guy that likes to have at least one car chase, one car flip, and some kind of irish-Kung fu brawl per movie is saying alot!)Great series, I am amazed at the quality and writing and casting of some of this British stuff. It really goes down well!  I  would recommend this to those that like reasonable melodrama, something for all ages, and breathtaking scenery!",4,If the Laird can't do it-who will????,1236902400,"03 13, 2009",2009,657,"['got', 'Monarch', 'Glen', 'series', '5', '6', 'Wife', 'birthday', 'year', 'started', 'Mid', 'February', 'will', 'come', 'close', 'Mid', 'March', 'when', 'last', 'gift', 'arrives', '.She', 'been', 'LONG', 'TIME', 'FAN', 'series', 'PBS', 'have', 'found', 'getting', 'involved', 'episodes', 'guy', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'car', 'chase', 'one', 'car', 'flip', 'kind', 'irish-Kung', 'fu', 'brawl', 'movie', 'saying', 'alot', 'Great', 'series', 'am', 'amazed', 'quality', 'writing', 'casting', 'British', 'stuff', 'really', 'down', 'well', 'would', 'recommend', 'like', 'reasonable', 'melodrama', 'something', 'ages', 'breathtaking', 'scenery']",Monarch of the Glen - The Complete Series 5 & 6

Some may miss the energy that existed between earlier characters but the newcomers keep things lively. If there is any criticism it might be that too many characters leave the series in short succession leaving little time for the writers to evolve the replacements. But overall the new characters work quite well.Some reviewers label this series a ""soap opera"",  a characterization with which I strongly disagree. The series revolves around personal relationships, but what truly engaging story doesn't? In American soap operas the relationships center around jealousy, lust, and betrayal. Monarch of the Glen is sprinkled with humor, pathos, and uniquely, people who ultimately show a lot of character. Hardly a formula for soap opera.The scenery is marvelous but is by no means the main point. Good writing and acting consistently steal the scene.",5,Great Entertainment,1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,918,"['great', 'series', 'continually', 'over', 'seven', 'seasons', 'may', 'miss', 'energy', 'existed', 'earlier', 'characters', 'newcomers', 'keep', 'things', 'lively', 'criticism', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'leave', 'series', 'short', 'succession', 'leaving', 'little', 'time', 'writers', 'evolve', 'replacements', 'new', 'characters', 'work', 'quite', 'well.Some', 'reviewers', 'label', 'series', 'soap', 'opera', 'characterization', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'series', 'personal', 'relationships', 'what', 'truly', 'engaging', 'story', ""n't"", 'American', 'soap', 'relationships', 'center', 'jealousy', 'lust', 'betrayal', 'Monarch', 'Glen', 'sprinkled', 'humor', 'pathos', 'uniquely', 'people', 'who', 'ultimately', 'show', 'lot', 'character', 'Hardly', 'formula', 'soap', 'opera.The', 'scenery', 'marvelous', 'main', 'point', 'Good', 'writing', 'acting', 'consistently', 'steal', 'scene']",Monarch of the Glen - The Complete Series 5 & 6
