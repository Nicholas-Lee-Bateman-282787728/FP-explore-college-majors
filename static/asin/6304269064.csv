Because in these type of movies, all the guys look the same- some exaggerated pretty boy look that most women out there think are good looking.  From a guys point of view, no, they are not attractive, and they act like typical dorks who don't know how to react towards their girlfriend, or how to react period.  They are just ""grown men who have trouble taking a hint"".Anyway, storyline-wise it's what you'd expect- guys sleeping with women, and women sleeping with men, and then they talk about all the problems with relationships throughout the film.  It's just a romance drama that's intended for adults.  My problem with these kind of movies is how they like to make being involved in a relationship look like the worst thing a human being could do.

I would just love to have a conversation with those who rated this film highly (first question: How many romatic comedies have you seen?). If romantic comedies were in short supply, then maybe you could kill two hours just to get a RC fix. But they're not, are they?""She's the One"" appears to be written by someone who just really really wanted to write a RC and drew together a bunch of elements that a film of this genre should have. But the end product is not all that funny, not at all satisfying, not particulary romantic, and the dramas the couples get into are not particularly believable.Of special note is the relationship between the couple that got married a day after meeting each other. Of all the scenerios, this was the most potentially compelling, because we are all interested in how such a spontaneous lifetime commitment works out. You have a cab driver scoring a ""trophy"" wife (Maxine Bahns, who is arguably even better looking than Cameron Diaz) for no good reason that's ever revealed to the audience. Why is this fox hanging out with this beer drinking near-do-well? We never find out. All we know is that after dumping him a few weeks into the marriage, she changes her mind and takes him back at the end of the film, just because he told her co-worker to tell her that he missed her. Give me a break. Pretty, famous faces and a Tom Petty sound track don't redeem this film.ps - If you want to see Edward Burns direct a well done New York based story of people with inter-locking lives, check out ""Sidewalks of New York"".",2,This little one's not worth the trouble,1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,1618,"['other', 'reviews', 'regarding', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'are', 'dead', 'would', 'just', 'love', 'have', 'conversation', 'who', 'rated', 'film', 'highly', 'first', 'question', 'How', 'many', 'romatic', 'comedies', 'have', 'seen', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'were', 'short', 'supply', 'then', 'maybe', 'could', 'kill', 'two', 'hours', 'just', 'get', 'RC', 'fix', ""'re"", 'not', 'are', 'One', 'be', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'really', 'really', 'wanted', 'write', 'RC', 'drew', 'together', 'bunch', 'elements', 'film', 'genre', 'should', 'have', 'end', 'product', 'not', 'funny', 'not', 'satisfying', 'not', 'particulary', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'couples', 'get', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'believable.Of', 'special', 'note', 'relationship', 'couple', 'got', 'married', 'day', 'meeting', 'other', 'scenerios', 'was', 'most', 'potentially', 'compelling', 'are', 'interested', 'how', 'such', 'spontaneous', 'lifetime', 'commitment', 'out', 'have', 'cab', 'driver', 'scoring', 'trophy', 'wife', 'Maxine', 'Bahns', 'who', 'arguably', 'even', 'better', 'looking', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'good', 'reason', 'ever', 'revealed', 'audience', 'Why', 'fox', 'hanging', 'out', 'beer', 'drinking', 'near-do-well', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'know', 'dumping', 'few', 'weeks', 'marriage', 'mind', 'back', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'told', 'co-worker', 'tell', 'missed', 'Give', 'break', 'Pretty', 'famous', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'sound', 'track', 'do', ""n't"", 'redeem', 'film.ps', 'want', 'see', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'direct', 'well', 'done', 'New', 'York', 'based', 'story', 'people', 'inter-locking', 'lives', 'check', 'Sidewalks', 'New', 'York']",She's the One

Enter Hope, the girl he would meet as he was giving her a cab ride to the airport, and he would marry the same day, much to the dismay of his older brother. His older brother is a rich man working wall street, married to Jennifer Aniston, many things make him lucky, yet he competes with Mickey the entire movie. The father of the two irish boys has his own problems, like he doesnt allow women on his boat. The major problem between the two is the older more successful brother is cheating on his wife with Cameron Diaz, who turns out to be Mickey's old fiancee who cheated on him.Not giving anything away, we realize all of this within the first little bit of the movie, but the brothers take awhile to put all the pieces together.

This was a very different movie about two brothers and their father who they like to go fishing with.  One brother (Francis) seems to have it all (a successful Wall Street career with Jennifer Anniston as a wife) while the other brother (Mickey)lives in a dump of an apartment with no tv (his ex-girlfriend Cameron Diaz didn't give it back to him when she ended their relationship by cheating on him) and drives a New York cab for a living.  Francis doesn't seem to be satisfied and is constantly jealous of his poorer brother because his brother is the happier of the two.  He is also carrying on affair with Heather (Cameron Diaz, who he doesn't realize was Mickey's ex).One day Mickey picks up Hope (Michelle Bahns) in his taxi, who is late to catch a flight to Tennessee or some state closeby.  There is a mutual attraction between the two right away and Hope is afraid to just let Mickey drive her to the airport so instead offers that he drive her all the way to her southern destination.  The two end up getting married on the trip.When Mickey and Hope get back, Hope's friend reminds her that she is supposed to move to Paris and did she mention that to Mickey before getting married?  Hope says that she is waiting for the right time to let him know.Things get dicey as Mickey meets up with Heather one more time.  She thinks it is to re-kindle what they had.  His only purpose is to get his tv back.After Mickey get his tv his brother starts to figure out that Heather was in fact Mickey's ex-girlfriend and this makes him boil.The story then has to resolve all the strained relationships if they can be.  The story seems to break down some towards the end and that is why I did not rate it higher.

Despite clich&eacute;d pauses, hand movements and contrived facial double takes, Eddie does give a credible performance as a reasonably convincing character who brings common sense to the story. Micky's father, played by John Mahoney, is an original and delightful character ably portrayed.The one very pleasant surprise is Maxine Bahns (Hope), who skilfully plays the major role of Mickey's wife. Her name isn't even mentioned in the DVD's Selected Features despite Diaz and Anniston being referred to ad-nauseam. Perhaps  Bahns just hasn't grown up in the TV sitcom school of over-acting and double takes. By contrast, Bahns' emotional responses are understated but nevertheless beautifully and meaningfully implied. She's a subtle and quiet delight and makes the film worthwhile despite its otherwise so called ""star cast"". The script does have some clever moments but suffers from the overuse of bad language.
