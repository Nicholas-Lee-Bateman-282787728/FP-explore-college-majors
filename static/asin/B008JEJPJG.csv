1554513,AHUHQKC55W48I,B008JEJPJG,David C. McMunn,"[3, 3]","The Last Challenge is another of Glen Ford's movies you'll truely enjoy watching.  Chad Everett is a young pistolero named Lot McGuire, who meets up with the older gun Marshal Dan Blaine (played by Glen Ford) on the open trail for a little relaxing conversation; a snort of whiskey; and some good fried fish.  What starts out as a friendly exchange of dialogue between the two men, abruptly comes to a screeching halt when the pistolero speaks of a man named Blaine he plans to challenge to a gunfight, only to find the man he wants to kill, is also the man he has been sitting face to face with the whole time.  Glen has a real liking for his young friend...and dreads the thought of having to kill him.  Angie Dickinson(Glen's girlfriend Lisa)fears the marshal is not up to the challenge; and tries to help him out in her own way.  Her interference only makes things worse!The Last Challenge is a top notch western...and a great addition to your video collection!",4,"The Last Challenge ""Great Acting-Great Movie!""",1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,965,"['Last', 'Challenge', 'Glen', 'Ford', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'truely', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'young', 'pistolero', 'named', 'Lot', 'McGuire', 'who', 'up', 'older', 'gun', 'Marshal', 'Dan', 'Blaine', 'played', 'Glen', 'Ford', 'open', 'trail', 'little', 'relaxing', 'conversation', 'snort', 'whiskey', 'good', 'fried', 'fish', 'What', 'out', 'friendly', 'exchange', 'dialogue', 'two', 'men', 'abruptly', 'screeching', 'halt', 'when', 'pistolero', 'speaks', 'man', 'named', 'Blaine', 'challenge', 'gunfight', 'only', 'find', 'man', 'kill', 'also', 'man', 'been', 'sitting', 'face', 'face', 'whole', 'time', 'Glen', 'real', 'liking', 'young', 'friend', 'thought', 'having', 'kill', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'Glen', 'girlfriend', 'Lisa', 'marshal', 'not', 'up', 'challenge', 'tries', 'help', 'out', 'own', 'way', 'interference', 'only', 'things', 'worse', 'Last', 'Challenge', 'top', 'notch', 'western', 'great', 'addition', 'video', 'collection']",N/A

1554518,A3ADLA0JPIICCO,B008JEJPJG,M.Lois,"[2, 5]","The Last Challenge is a 1967 western starring Glenn Ford, Angie Dickinson and Chad Everett and was written into a screen play by Albert Maltz. Maltz was one of the Hollywood 10, a list of screenwriters who found themselves blacklisted in the 1950s by HUAC, the House Un-American Activities Committee. The plot is an old one - a young gunslinger Lot McGuire (Chad Everett) wants to challenge the experienced older veteran, Marshall Dan Blaine, played by Glenn Ford. Miss Lisa Denton (Angie Dickinson) is Blaine's love interest and the owner of the local ""sporting house"". Lot and Dan meet outside of town without an exchange of who they are, and a bond is forged. This theme appears throughout the movie, even tho' Lot is determined to go through with his challenge. Of course, as in every western the inevitable happens and Lot is killed in a high noon moment.(Poor Chad Everett,certainly a handsome dead young gunslinger). Marshall Blaine rides off into the sunset, saddened by his deed and Lisa Denton is left bereft. The Last Challenge was well acted, and although I thoroughly enjoyed it, it was not a great movie, but...
