560955,A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y,B00004Z4SE,Ben Adam,"[6, 10]","The Rodgers and Hammerstein musical has an excellent score, and when it was premiered in 1957, both Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show to promote their musical, explaining that it was a ""traditional retelling"" of the classic story of Cinderella. Fortunately for them, they did not live to see this production, for they would surely have died had they seen it. Somehow even the score was not left intact, as a song from No Strings invaded the score, and the result was something short of catastrophic.While the performers in the cast are great singers, their acting ability leaves MUCH to be desired. Brandy, who plays Cinderella, is no actress. Whoopi Goldberg and Jason Alexander, while beloved to audiences for what they do well, hardly seemed right for this story. Whitney Houston may be a great singer, but the suggestion of her being Cinderella's fairy godmother just makes no sense at all. There are some funny sequences here and there, but the whole production comes across as bombastic and unconvincing. For all the money that went into making this fiasco, the audience deserved a lot more than it gets. The original 1957 version is by far the best, and the 1965 version, while not nearly as good as the original, still greatly outshines this turkey. Had the various performers just been gathered to sing the score on a recording, it would have been far better than to have made this rather garish attempt at a production that falls far short of its predecessors, because while the vocal talents are excellent, quite simply, they just can't act!",2,"An Excellent Musical, but Why This Production?",1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,1589,"['Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'musical', 'excellent', 'score', 'when', 'was', 'premiered', '1957', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'Oscar', 'Hammerstein', 'appeared', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Show', 'promote', 'musical', 'explaining', 'was', 'traditional', 'retelling', 'classic', 'story', 'Cinderella', 'Fortunately', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'see', 'production', 'would', 'surely', 'have', 'died', 'had', 'seen', 'Somehow', 'even', 'score', 'was', 'not', 'left', 'intact', 'song', 'No', 'Strings', 'invaded', 'score', 'result', 'was', 'something', 'short', 'catastrophic.While', 'performers', 'cast', 'are', 'great', 'singers', 'acting', 'ability', 'MUCH', 'be', 'desired', 'Brandy', 'who', 'Cinderella', 'actress', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'beloved', 'audiences', 'what', 'do', 'well', 'hardly', 'seemed', 'right', 'story', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'singer', 'suggestion', 'being', 'Cinderella', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'just', 'sense', 'are', 'funny', 'sequences', 'here', 'there', 'whole', 'production', 'bombastic', 'unconvincing', 'money', 'went', 'making', 'fiasco', 'audience', 'deserved', 'lot', 'more', 'original', '1957', 'version', 'far', 'best', '1965', 'version', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'still', 'greatly', 'turkey', 'Had', 'various', 'performers', 'just', 'been', 'gathered', 'sing', 'score', 'recording', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'have', 'made', 'rather', 'garish', 'attempt', 'production', 'far', 'short', 'predecessors', 'vocal', 'talents', 'are', 'excellent', 'quite', 'simply', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act']",Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella

No pun intended; the multiracial cast does add flair, a lot of flair. But somehow this version is just more interesting all around. The characters are more rounded out (take Paolo Montalban as the Prince, for example,) seeming less like two-dimensional stock fairytale characters, more like real personalities. There are more little details, more things going on, such as the marketplace puppet show and the stepsisters shopping for (and quarreling over) clothes in the first scene.As a child I'd loved the 1964 televison broadcast, which everyone got to view about once a year. After seeing this one, however, I felt the 1964 show was a bit tame by comparison...I didn't notice that Brandi ""couldn't act."" To me, it seemed she was just playing a quieter, stronger, more serious, perhaps even a bit more cynical Cinderella (could it be that she learned to be more reserved in order to protect herself emotionally, after all those years of scolding?) than Lesley Ann Warren's timid, wide-eyed and very-easily-hurt character (I always identified with the stepsister who notes ominously, ""And with very little trouble, I could break her little arm..."")

I've nothing against interracial relationships whatsoever, its just that I was confused as to how a Caucasian king and a black queen ended up with an Asian son.  But this is a fairy tale and fairy tales are fantasies that don't make sense and aren't supposed to.  Besides, if Disney made an all black Cinderella, chances are no one would have seen or bought it (have you noticed that they've never made an animated fairy/hero tale centered around black people? Lion King doesn't count - those were lions not people). Anyway, this was a fun movie.  Brandy was a wonderfully, beautiful Cinderella.  Her prince was handsome.  Her stepmother was appropriately evil and her stepsisters sufficiently obnoxious.  Whoopie was the Whoopie I love and after seeing this movie I still can't stand Jason Alexander.  For me there were only two weak links in this movie.  The worst character was Whitney Houston as the fairy godmother.  I just wanted to rip her cape or whatever off of her because her twirling around with it was so annoying.  And she came off as just too full of herself to really be caring about Cinderella.  The second weakness was the Broadway type song they added for Bernadette Peters to sing.  It was a totally different style of song and didn't fit with the other songs in the movie.

But it was rather disappointing, overall; having now seen all three televised versions, I have to say that this is my least favourite of the lot.Oh, it has its good points (the prince is very likeable, for instance) but the production is marred by poor casting.  I can't believe that a more charismatic actress (and better singer) couldn't be found for the title role.  In addition, there are several other primary cast members that I really don't care for (and whom, in a few instances, I actively dislike).  I know, that's a pretty subjective statement, but heck, I found both Whoopi Goldberg and Jason Alexander pretty darn annoying in their roles.While this is certainly a more polished production than the earlier attempts, what on earth were they thinking with the set design?  I suppose a whimsical look was being attempted, to depict a fairy-tale type of world.  But honestly, the sets are so ugly in many cases as to be distracting to the eye.But perhaps my main disappointment was with the orchestrations.  I didn't see any need whatsoever to give an updated pop sound to the instrumentals.  Rogers and Hammerstein musicals have a very distinctive, classic sound, and I found I missed it terribly; it was a big mistake, in my opinion, to change the music.So... what did I like, you are probably wondering!

Too many stars, too many settings, costumes, effects. There is no subtletly suggesting a fairy-tale-like, magical story: watching it you almost get the impression ""Hey, this could happen to me!"" (Maybe this was the filmmakers' aim, who knows.)What I really found annoying was the pseudo-psychological morals applied, in particular during the dialogues between Cinderella and the Fairy Godmother. While the original fairy tale has female virtue for its topic (a girl wanting a guy to search for her, to ensure that he really has serious intentions and that he doesn't mind her being just a poor girl), as well as the fact that the really important things in life are gifts, this film's bottom line seems to be ""follow your dreams"".I don't want to suggest that this attitude is absolutely wrong, but it did get on my nerves how e.g. Fairy Godmother insisted that Cinderella was only standing in her own way not going to the ball: she had to be reminded that the girl had no way to get there. I mean, wasn't it obvious enough? What is this supposed to tell the viewers - just wish hard enough, and the laws of judgment and physics will just disappear for you, and there will be absolutely no consequences to bear, neither for you nor anyone else?

561001,A3C4I8X6V1RRGC,B00004Z4SE,Steven Capsuto,"[2, 2]","Each of the three TV productions of Rodgers & Hammerstein's ""Cinderella"" has something to recommend it: The original has Julie Andrews' gorgeous singing and gentle charm, and a great supporting cast. The 1960s remake is a classic, romantic example of that decade's stage-like video musicals. This 1997 version has the slickest production values of the three and - by far - the best script and character development.For example, it's the only version where I believed that Cinderella and the Prince had anything in common and could conceivably fall in love that quickly. And (spoiler alert:) I love that in this production, he recognizes her *before* putting the shoe on her foot. I always wondered why Cinderella would want to marry a guy who couldn't recognize her except by her shoe size. Here he clearly likes her in many ways. The Stepmother and other supporting roles also get more character development here than the previous 75-minute versions allowed.Brandy is immensely likable in the title role. Paolo Montalb&aacute;n looks, sounds and acts every bit the Prince. Whitney Houston makes a strong fairy godmother, and Bernadette Peters is fantastic as the bitter, scenery-chewing stepmother.I like most of Rob Marshall's choreography. The waltzes are danced beautifully, and the staging of other numbers shows wit and grace. However, the elaborate dance break in the middle of Jason Alexander's song ""The Prince is Giving a Ball"" is interminable, derivative and adds nothing to the film.In short, although the tone is different from the previous productions, this remake holds up well on its own terms.",4,A charming remake with a strong script,1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,1610,"['three', 'TV', 'productions', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'Cinderella', 'something', 'recommend', 'original', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'gorgeous', 'singing', 'gentle', 'charm', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', '1960s', 'remake', 'classic', 'romantic', 'example', 'decade', 'stage-like', 'video', 'musicals', '1997', 'version', 'slickest', 'production', 'values', 'three', 'far', 'best', 'script', 'character', 'development.For', 'example', 'only', 'version', 'where', 'believed', 'Cinderella', 'Prince', 'had', 'anything', 'common', 'could', 'conceivably', 'fall', 'love', 'quickly', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'love', 'production', '*before*', 'putting', 'shoe', 'foot', 'always', 'wondered', 'why', 'Cinderella', 'would', 'want', 'marry', 'guy', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'except', 'shoe', 'size', 'Here', 'clearly', 'many', 'ways', 'Stepmother', 'other', 'supporting', 'roles', 'also', 'get', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'here', 'previous', '75-minute', 'versions', 'allowed.Brandy', 'immensely', 'likable', 'title', 'role', 'Paolo', 'Montalb', 'aacute', 'bit', 'Prince', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'strong', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'fantastic', 'bitter', 'scenery-chewing', 'stepmother.I', 'most', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'choreography', 'waltzes', 'are', 'danced', 'beautifully', 'staging', 'other', 'numbers', 'wit', 'grace', 'However', 'elaborate', 'dance', 'break', 'middle', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'song', 'Prince', 'Giving', 'Ball', 'interminable', 'derivative', 'nothing', 'film.In', 'short', 'tone', 'different', 'previous', 'productions', 'remake', 'up', 'well', 'own', 'terms']",Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella
561002,A37NL9EDUT23IV,B00004Z4SE,"takemehome ""Joey""","[2, 3]","In 1997, forty years after Julie Andrews performed the title role LIVE in Rodgers and Hammerstein's TV production of Cinderella, R&B; singer Brandy brought the role to life in TV's third incarnation of this musical classic, produced by The Wonderful World of Disney and Whitney Houston, who played the fairy godmother. Ratings were huge for the program, and it even won an Emmy.This new production is different from the previous two in several ways. For one, this one is a made-for-TV movie, whereas the previous two were shot as if they were televising a play. This new version also has three new songs - The Sweetest Sounds, written by Richard Rodgers, The Music's In You, and Falling In Love With Love, written by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. Updated special effects, more modern vernacular, a more empowered Cinderella, and a color-blind casting approach lend a freshness to the classic fairy tale. And I'm not too thrilled with all the complaints about the mixed cast. I, for one, am thrilled that little girls and little boys can watch this and see themselves represented, no matter what race they are. It's nice that for once, a little African American girl can see herself as the object of desire. And yes, the black queen and white king have an Asian son. Families like that are not uncommon today. Funny that people don't have a problem with a pumpkin becoming a carriage or mice becoming horses, but they have a problem with this.A few flaws exist in the film. The CGI effects are sometimes a little TOO obvious, such as in the pumpkin transformation sequence. And although Brandy is sweet and lovely as Cinderella, she's no Julie Andrews. These flaws do not detract from the general charm of this production, and don't put me off at all. I love Brandy's performance, and her more modern feminist approach to the character of Cinderella.However, Disney needs to release a new DVD version. This DVD is one of the first Disney DVDs ever - in fact, this DVD predates the ""Disney DVD"" brand and logo. The bonus features include a home video release trailer and ""A Cinderella Story"" featurette. I think it's time to update this DVD release. The transfer is very good, but could possibly use a bit of remastering. Maybe some retrospective bonus materials. And, since an official soundtrack was never released, a music-only track would also be a nice idea. Maybe some audio commentary from the actors and producers and such.Despite all the flaws of this DVD treatment and the flaws of the production itself, it's definitely a DVD I was thrilled to find for $10 at a local drug store, because I've loved this production ever since it first aired in November of 1997 on ABC. It's definitely worth buying.",4,"Another winner, but could use a new DVD treatment.",1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,2710,"['1997', 'forty', 'years', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'performed', 'title', 'role', 'LIVE', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'TV', 'production', 'Cinderella', 'R', 'B', 'singer', 'Brandy', 'brought', 'role', 'life', 'TV', 'third', 'incarnation', 'musical', 'classic', 'produced', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'who', 'played', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'Ratings', 'were', 'huge', 'program', 'even', 'won', 'Emmy.This', 'new', 'production', 'different', 'previous', 'two', 'several', 'ways', 'one', 'one', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'previous', 'two', 'were', 'shot', 'were', 'televising', 'play', 'new', 'version', 'also', 'three', 'new', 'songs', 'Sweetest', 'Sounds', 'written', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'Music', 'Falling', 'Love', 'Love', 'written', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'Lorenz', 'Hart', 'Updated', 'special', 'effects', 'more', 'modern', 'vernacular', 'more', 'empowered', 'Cinderella', 'color-blind', 'casting', 'approach', 'lend', 'freshness', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tale', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'thrilled', 'complaints', 'mixed', 'cast', 'one', 'am', 'thrilled', 'little', 'girls', 'little', 'boys', 'can', 'watch', 'see', 'represented', 'matter', 'what', 'race', 'are', 'nice', 'once', 'little', 'African', 'American', 'girl', 'can', 'see', 'object', 'desire', 'yes', 'black', 'queen', 'white', 'king', 'have', 'Asian', 'son', 'Families', 'are', 'not', 'uncommon', 'today', 'Funny', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'pumpkin', 'becoming', 'carriage', 'mice', 'becoming', 'horses', 'have', 'problem', 'this.A', 'few', 'flaws', 'exist', 'film', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'sometimes', 'little', 'TOO', 'obvious', 'such', 'pumpkin', 'transformation', 'sequence', 'Brandy', 'sweet', 'lovely', 'Cinderella', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'flaws', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'general', 'charm', 'production', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'off', 'love', 'Brandy', 'performance', 'more', 'modern', 'feminist', 'approach', 'character', 'Cinderella.However', 'Disney', 'release', 'new', 'DVD', 'version', 'DVD', 'one', 'first', 'Disney', 'DVDs', 'ever', 'fact', 'DVD', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'brand', 'logo', 'bonus', 'include', 'home', 'video', 'release', 'trailer', 'A', 'Cinderella', 'Story', 'featurette', 'think', 'time', 'update', 'DVD', 'release', 'transfer', 'very', 'good', 'could', 'possibly', 'use', 'bit', 'remastering', 'Maybe', 'retrospective', 'bonus', 'materials', 'official', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'music-only', 'track', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'nice', 'idea', 'Maybe', 'audio', 'commentary', 'actors', 'producers', 'such.Despite', 'flaws', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'flaws', 'production', 'definitely', 'DVD', 'was', 'thrilled', 'find', '10', 'local', 'drug', 'store', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'production', 'ever', 'first', 'aired', 'November', '1997', 'ABC', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buying']",Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella

The songs are all enchanting and engrossing, sure to get the attention of all. A great job was done on improving the libretto, the one thing that always flawed this show, despite its wonderful score.Most of the performances are great, excluding a few. I've probably made it clear that Brandy did not do a great job as the title character. She seems overly stiff and, though a proven singer, cannot handle the glorious R&H; songs. One of the best songs from this show ""In My Own Little Corner"" is still entertaining, but not nearly as much as it should have been. It surprised me when Whitney Houston popped up as the fairy godmother. When I first realized that she was playing the part, I got sort of frustrated. However, she actually does an excellent job, making the character her own. She, of course, puts a lot of her own personality into the character, but it seems to work. Her intertpretaion of the character was new and fresh, and her rendetion of ""Impossible"" is super. I'm a fan of Jason Alexander and he does a good job portraying the prince's steward. His theater experience shows in his performance. I must ask though- why the accent? He did not need it at all and it was very distracting! Whoopi Goldberg and Victor Garber are exceptional as the King and Queen, despite their limited screen time. It was nice to have these two veterans show up. The two stepsisters are hysterical. Their rendetion of ""Step-sister's Lament"" was priceless, it had me howling!However, the performer who steal the show is the great Broadway veteran Bernadette Peters. Her performance and interpretation of the wicked step-mother was fresh and original. She could have easily just made her a typical villan, but gives humane qualities. She is absolutely fabulous, a Broadway legend. I loved her solo ""Falling in Love with Love""! A great added Rodgers and Hart song from ""The Boys from Syracuse""! It amazed how that song so easily flowed into the score. (The remake also added the Rodgers and, well, Rodgers song ""The Sweetest Sounds"" as the opening number, to great effect I might add!)The sets and costumes seem a little bit much, but they contribute to the enchanting qualities of this remake. It is a great film that your family will love and fall in love with. A great film! Despite the one poor casting decision! Hope you enjoy it.*******If your family bought and enjoyed this, you might also enjoy the ABC productions of ""Annie"" and ""The Music Man"".
