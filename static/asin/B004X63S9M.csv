1431485,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B004X63S9M,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 0]","Ken Russell's biopic of sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska is breathtaking. Scott Antony stars as the impassioned sculptor, who goes from copying the works of others to making groundbreaking sculpture of his own, based on primitive art. His Muse is the much older Sophie Brzeska, who is 2 decades his senior (Dorothy Tutin) Their relationship is complex&fraught.; She is maternal towards him, nurtures his art, while his own mother rejects him. Sometimes he calls her his sister, or his housekeeper. In a scene like something fromLike Water For Chocolate, Sophie infuses passion in her cooking as she tells her life story. At times, he acts like he is interested in other men, from flirting with a fellow male student in Paris, to taking on an androgynous Englishman as his patron in London. Henri proudly wields his phallic drill, worships a totem from Easter Island that thrusts forth in an art gallery, and fondles the bosom of a statue as he creates it. Helen Mirren stars as a suffragette who bares all for Henri, she is as seductive in leading Henri to fighting in the First World War as she later was as Sofia Tolstoy opposite Leo inThe Last Stationor as Ayn Rand as she seduces a young student inThe Passion of Ayn Rand.""Savage Messiah"" ends with a beautiful montage of Gaudier-Brzeska's sculptures set to classical music;it is Sophie's vision in their bare London flat. Sophie Brzeska spent her final years, maddened, in an insane asylum;her contribution to Henri's art is often dismissed, but Ken Russell showed how much she influenced&nurtured; him. Like Sofia Tolstoy, her final years were spent in a hysteria of sorts, mourning the man who was her Muse&whom; she had inspired, and battling over his legacy. Like Sofia Tolstoy, she kept his art alive. Gaudier-Brzeska died young, prematurely, in the First World War, but Russell shows that true art is immortal.",5,"""Art is revolution!""",1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,1869,"['Ken', 'Russell', 'biopic', 'sculptor', 'Henri', 'Gaudier-Brzeska', 'breathtaking', 'Scott', 'Antony', 'impassioned', 'sculptor', 'who', 'copying', 'works', 'others', 'making', 'groundbreaking', 'sculpture', 'own', 'based', 'primitive', 'art', 'Muse', 'much', 'older', 'Sophie', 'Brzeska', 'who', '2', 'decades', 'senior', 'Dorothy', 'Tutin', 'relationship', 'complex', 'fraught', 'maternal', 'towards', 'art', 'own', 'mother', 'Sometimes', 'sister', 'housekeeper', 'scene', 'something', 'fromLike', 'Water', 'Chocolate', 'Sophie', 'passion', 'cooking', 'life', 'story', 'times', 'interested', 'other', 'men', 'flirting', 'fellow', 'male', 'student', 'Paris', 'taking', 'androgynous', 'Englishman', 'patron', 'London', 'Henri', 'proudly', 'wields', 'phallic', 'drill', 'totem', 'Easter', 'Island', 'forth', 'art', 'gallery', 'bosom', 'statue', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'suffragette', 'who', 'Henri', 'as', 'seductive', 'leading', 'Henri', 'fighting', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'later', 'was', 'Sofia', 'Tolstoy', 'opposite', 'Leo', 'inThe', 'Last', 'Stationor', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'young', 'student', 'inThe', 'Passion', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'Savage', 'Messiah', 'beautiful', 'montage', 'Gaudier-Brzeska', 'sculptures', 'set', 'classical', 'music', 'Sophie', 'vision', 'bare', 'London', 'flat', 'Sophie', 'Brzeska', 'spent', 'final', 'years', 'maddened', 'insane', 'asylum', 'contribution', 'Henri', 'art', 'often', 'dismissed', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'showed', 'how', 'much', 'influenced', 'nurtured', 'Sofia', 'Tolstoy', 'final', 'years', 'were', 'spent', 'hysteria', 'sorts', 'mourning', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'Muse', 'whom', 'had', 'inspired', 'battling', 'legacy', 'Sofia', 'Tolstoy', 'kept', 'art', 'alive', 'Gaudier-Brzeska', 'died', 'young', 'prematurely', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'Russell', 'true', 'art', 'immortal']",N/A

Wishing to keep him warm until his mother can retrieve him, the farmer places the little bird in the warm smoking center of fresh cow dung. After the little fellow warms up, he sticks his head out of the dung and begins to chirp for his mother. He is unfortunately seen by a hungry fox who runs over and bites off his head.

Not a great film, but it burned itself into a deep place in my psyche.  Perhaps it's because of the searingly intense portrayal of the innate need of true artists (and madmen?) to be creative.  Gaudier-Brzeska fought in WW I; he received a decoration for bravery, but was killed in the trenches at Neuville-Saint-Vaast. During his time in the Army, he sculpted a figure out of the butt of a rifle taken from a German soldier.  I will always remember that primitive carving.  Even Helen Mirren's brave full frontal nudity takes a back seat -- well, almost -- to the art of Gaudier-Brzeska.

1431494,A13KD7LRYNAEX5,B004X63S9M,tuatara,"[3, 3]","I was shocked but very happy to see that Warner Archives finally got around to releasing Russell's early 1970s biographical film on French sculptor Henri Gaudier. This is one of Russell's less strident works and is quite effective in showing the rather odd platonic relationship between the artist and Sophie Brzeska, a Polish woman twenty years older than Gaudier. The performances are good, especially Dorothy Tutin as Sophie. Scott Antony as the artist Gaudier has his moments though some would say Russell's portrayal of him as a hyperactive bohemian is a little excessive. But what would a Ken Russell film be without a little excess!! Theres also a flamboyant performance from Helen Mirren as a radical suffragette and a scene of her descending a flight of stairs that might surprise current admirers.(of course, this was a very early role for her). A nice touch comes at the end of the film where Russell has managed to collect actual works of the artist for a posthumous exhibition.(Gaudier was killed in a WWI battle in France and was only in his early 20s).The scene, intercutting images of a grieving Sophie with the impressive sculptors underlines the artist's loss, both personally for her and the art world in general.  As for the dvd this is a very barebones affair. It is a DVD-R and there are no subtitles nor chapters. The film has been remastered and is widescreen(16x9)1:85.1 ratio. Though not flawless, its the best quality I've seen of this film and for admirers of this particular film I would recommend it. I'm afraid this might be as good as we'll ever see for this film.
