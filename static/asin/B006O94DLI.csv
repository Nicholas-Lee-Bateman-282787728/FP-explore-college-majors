Go watch season one if you don't know the what the story is about by now.But as story telling goes, this is the most insane roller coaster ride I have ever watched, much more than the first season. There is gleefull delight with writers of this story constantly turning situations upside down, & inside out, with almost every episode revealing one of those, ""Oh wow, I can't believe that just happened"" plot twists (often more than one of those events in one short 25 minute episode). All the way to final scene, you are left guessing who is playing who? Who is really the chessmaster & who are really the pawns? What the hell is Lelouch's final end game? Double crosses, and double-double crosses keep things inventively twisted & compelling to the very end. All the while done in a very over the top theatrical style, and for the biggest stakes - world domination. The style comes accross as if our animated actors are performing to a live audience on a stage, and not subtly played to a camera. Everything about this show is done in grand style, and it makes for an epic experience in my opinion.My head was seriously spinning after watching this series...not in a bad way, because it all makes sense within it's own strange reality, and the story progresses masterfully. But watching it all unfold is quite the twisty rollercoaster of a ride.",5,Deliciously devilish story telling,1333929600,"04 9, 2012",2012,1418,"['need', 'talk', 'basic', 'plot', 'are', 'talking', 'season', 'two', 'Go', 'watch', 'season', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'story', 'now.But', 'story', 'telling', 'most', 'insane', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'much', 'more', 'first', 'season', 'gleefull', 'delight', 'writers', 'story', 'constantly', 'turning', 'situations', 'upside', 'down', 'out', 'almost', 'episode', 'revealing', 'one', 'Oh', 'wow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'just', 'happened', 'plot', 'twists', 'often', 'more', 'one', 'events', 'one', 'short', '25', 'minute', 'episode', 'way', 'final', 'scene', 'are', 'left', 'guessing', 'who', 'playing', 'who', 'Who', 'really', 'chessmaster', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'pawns', 'What', 'hell', 'Lelouch', 'final', 'end', 'game', 'Double', 'crosses', 'double-double', 'crosses', 'keep', 'things', 'inventively', 'twisted', 'compelling', 'very', 'end', 'while', 'done', 'very', 'top', 'theatrical', 'style', 'biggest', 'stakes', 'world', 'domination', 'style', 'accross', 'animated', 'actors', 'are', 'performing', 'live', 'audience', 'stage', 'not', 'subtly', 'played', 'camera', 'Everything', 'show', 'done', 'grand', 'style', 'epic', 'experience', 'opinion.My', 'head', 'was', 'seriously', 'spinning', 'watching', 'series', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'sense', 'own', 'strange', 'reality', 'story', 'masterfully', 'watching', 'unfold', 'quite', 'twisty', 'rollercoaster', 'ride']",Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion
1517865,A1ZGOZCYNZYXUG,B006O94DLI,Ghost,"[4, 4]","First off, I will say that I love this series, but it is not a review of the show but rather for the product and trying to bring awareness of the product's availability and bootleg problems plaguing the marketplace. This is not a seller problem, but these will be found at conventions, online retailers, and brick and mortar stores that don't know better.In 2012 Bandai Entertainment USA went out of business. Since then many bootlegs have hit the market, especially for the popular shows.These bootlegs typically come in a clear case and are nearly indistinguishable between the retail copy. These bootlegs are using the same disc count, disc art, and are copying the DVD sleeves art and information as you would see with the official retail release  1:1. The DVDs they're using for these are DVD-5's, meaning that the max they can put on the disc is about 4.75 Gigs while the official retail releases use DVD-9's. Due to the fact it's impossible to tell by looking at the DVD set, the only way to know for sure if you have a bootleg or retail copy is to check the disc's properties in your computer.The only way you will know for sure that you got an official retail copy, will be:1. If you buy *directly* from Amazon or Rightstuf. Their warehouse stock comes directly from the publisher.2. If you buy new it will come with a security sticker.3. The final test to see if it is legit is to put it into your computer and see if the disc is less than or greater than 4.75 Gigs. If it's greater than that, then you should be good.Example: [...](note: the bootleg on the right was not an Anime Legends bootleg, so they may have copied the disc file name for these as well)I hope you found this information useful. There's not many people who know about this and I'd hate for people to continue falling prey to buying bootlegs.Not only is this happening to Bandai's Anime Legends sets, but it's also happening to Discotek Media's sets as well.Sources of information:1.

1517868,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B006O94DLI,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","Code Geass is a story about a young man named Lelouch. Lelouch is a genius, and the son of the King. Japan is ruled by a foreign and tyrannical emperor. There is a poorly organized resistance group that is trying to take back their homeland. Lelouch decides to become their leader and to take revenge on his father for his sisters poor condition. He gains the power of Geass. His power allows him to make anyone he wants do exactly as he says; but he can only use it on each person once. The story tells of his rise to power and all of the tragedy that befalls him and those close to him.This 2nd season continues the story and is as good as the 1st. It's very tragic though. Lelouch did everything to protect his beloved little sister, but he suffers terribly b/c of his Geass and his desire to take revenge for her. The people around him also suffer immensely as well. The drama of this story is even more heavy in this chapter of the story.This anime has everything. Great story, animation, voicing, music, and lots of great characters.

1517869,A23Y7C8U1JZ20G,B006O94DLI,Ray,"[34, 37]","First I want to start off by saying for some weird reason Amazon doesn't have it in stock and some of the other sellers want over $100 dollars to buy it from them... Don't make me laugh. Head on over to Rightstuf and pay no more than $29.99 just like I did to get this amazing series finale of Code Geass.Onto the review -As one of Bandai's final releases I feel it was very well done, the packaging was a good sized case just like what they released Wolf's Rain Perfect Collection in. It held all 8 discs nicely without scratching up anything, although it had no inserts which doesn't really matter to me, it did get the job done and that's really all you can ask for if you ask me. This seasons box set is bigger than the first seasons as well, I'm not sure why season 1's set is smaller but it is if you don't already own it like I do.This is the final season of Code Geass at the moment (a third season is planned in Japan but that's a completely different topic) and it finishes things up nicely with amazing animation, more character development, good DVD extras (Audio Commentaries, Key Animation Galleries, Prize Announcements, Extra Flash: Baba Theater Redux, Textless Openings, Textless Endings, Extra Prologues and Previews). I loved the final episode, it was pretty touching and I don't want to give much away in this review, so no spoilers but there is a pretty major character death too, along with others of course but yep just to say that without giving away names or anything for those who haven't seen R2 (lol).Basically if you are looking for this set at this point in time head on over to Rightstuf or Anime Corner Store to pick it up for under $37.98 from either of those online shops I also use, the prices on Amazon are crazy.. literally.Another thing is pick this and season 1 up quick while you still can. For those who didn't know, Bandai is done releasing anymore DVDs/Blurays as of January 2012 so what they have now is all they have until their licenses expire and once that happen its all over and the DVD sets you might want will be gone and out of print.
