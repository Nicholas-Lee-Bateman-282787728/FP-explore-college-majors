Some of the prints used look pretty good considering that they are low budget largely independent productions from the 1930s. Transfers are superior to Alpha's and other PD releases. As with other Firecake collections, the British titles have the superior transfers. THE GHOUL is a knockout transfer. Surprising to see CHARLIE CHAN'S SECRET here, as it is not in the public domain and is available from Fox, but it is a most welcome addition to the collection. Highly recommended disc!",5,agree with all,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,569,"['transfers', 'are', 'SD', 'great', 'collection', 'transfers', 'are', 'great', 'prints', 'used', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'considering', 'are', 'low', 'budget', 'largely', 'independent', 'productions', '1930s', 'Transfers', 'are', 'superior', 'Alpha', 'other', 'PD', 'releases', 'other', 'Firecake', 'collections', 'British', 'titles', 'have', 'superior', 'transfers', 'GHOUL', 'knockout', 'transfer', 'Surprising', 'see', 'CHARLIE', 'CHAN', 'SECRET', 'here', 'not', 'public', 'domain', 'available', 'Fox', 'most', 'welcome', 'addition', 'collection', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'disc']",The Old Dark House Mystery Collection: (Cat and the Canary / One Frightened Night / Then There Were None / Bat / House on Haunted Hill / and more)

I had it out and in the player over the last few days and it is not being recognized by my player.  It says ""No disc"" every time I try to play it.It's not defective because it plays fine on my Maxmade portable Blu-Ray player.  I can also play it on my computer with Power DVD 13 and a Samsung Blu Ray drive.I have every film in this collection in other DVD editions.Of course I was not expecting this to look great, but I wanted to have all these films in one place and I thought that it was a good thing using a Blu Ray blank to store them.  There are even a few films here that look to be upgrades from other copies I have.But not being able to play this on my big screen TV is a problem.Another thing that was disappointing was that CAT AND THE CANARY and THE BAT, two silent films, seem not to have intertitles but they are sub titled instead!  I have only spot checked these two and was surprised to see all these subtitles while the actors are speaking.  Not sure if intertitles are totally missing or not.  I found this to be rather annoying.And NO folks, THE GHOUL is nowhere near the quality of the MGM DVD as some posters here and other places are thinking.  It's not as good as the UK DVD either.  I have both.  The UK DVD has a good audio commentary also so DON'T even think of replacing that with this copy!Some of the titles spot checked slightly better than their Alpha, etc counterparts, but not all that much.MURDER BY INVITATION, one of my favorites, has a phony title card that is lifted from the trailer and I noticed a few other instances of burned on monkey business during opening and end credits also.Sorry this is only my first impression of this set and its not very detailed as I have not yet done any serious watching, but I wanted to get this warning out to everyone first.Bottom line:  Don't get rid of your older copies of these films before you buy this as there is the possibility it won't play at all!  If you don't have a lot of these films, you will get a good buy if you can play it.If I actually do play many of these and find any plus or minus features I will try to remember to add to this post.",2,Old Dark House films.

Kling,"[4, 4]","The fact that these movies are not 1080i is of no consequence, I would love to have them all in better transfers, But that is never going to happen, so just love the ones you're given. The price for these is probably the sticking point for most people,  You get 24 movies for $24.99 That's less than $1.04 per movie and most are real good transfers some are bad but much better than what youl'd get in some of those multi pack movies.

1683419,A3ICVJQMZAGQV5,B00H3GQEEK,wisdomstar,"[4, 4]","Although this is a blu-ray, notice that you are not going to get the high resolution most blu-rays are capable of (1080p). If watched on a large screen (I have a 46&#34;) one movie (And Then There Were None) is pretty blurry and jerky. However, on a small screen (a blu-ray portable with a 9&#34; screen) it looks pretty good. In comparison with the VCI Entertainment blu of the same movie, I couldn't see any difference between the two, which means that they are probably the same transfer. But I paid more than half of this collection's for the VCI blu by itself. Other movies I have watched so far are comparable to what I have on DVD such as Charlie Chan's Secret or the Thirteenth Guest. But the plus is the movies I don't have and 23 movies for a low price. Topper 2 is one of my favorites (Billie Burke and Patsy Kelly together are very funny). So I would highly recommend this set because there are many gems in it.
