It's 2 hours long but seeing how it was released straight to DVD, why not make it 4 hours long?The orignal Woodstock film was 3 hours long (directors cut 40 more mins added) but the also used a double screen alot to get more in the movie, I wish this epic even was given the same treatment.You had sych historical recordings....The Doors......Jim Morrison's last libe stage peformance and he sounded great!  Jim didnt want the spot lights in the band, so they are shown playing in almost total darkness and when they do ""The End"" it just has that great feeling to the song, I wish they showed more of the Doors or release the complete performance of them.One thing  I like about this film was the realism, I get so sick of hearing about ""wooodstock"" that it was 3 days of Peace and LOve....BS!  The hippies crashed the fences and didnt give a crap about the promoters and other men and and women who put the festival on. Feeling they can just storm in and not have to pay for an event and just stiff the promoters to have to dig in their own pockets to pay the artists and everything else,  With Woodstock, the promoters already had a film and record deal signed and wasnt too concernd about tickets but they still took a huge financial hit, but Isle of Wight, same crap, young punks tearing down the fences to get in, too cheap tom pay 3 pounds, it wouldnt kill them, but them all crashing the fences cost the promoters their asses!Great documentary about the so called ""love child"" generation that were just as selfish and spoiled as the ME generation, same crap, different title.Wish the film were longer but it is what it is.",4,"good film, has last Jim Morrison performance",1250553600,"08 18, 2009",2009,1748,"['DVD', 'box', 'film', 'highlights', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'eing', 'said', 'good', 'highlights', 'film', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'seeing', 'how', 'was', 'released', 'straight', 'DVD', 'why', 'not', 'make', '4', 'hours', 'long', 'orignal', 'Woodstock', 'film', 'was', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'directors', 'cut', '40', 'more', 'mins', 'added', 'also', 'used', 'double', 'screen', 'alot', 'get', 'more', 'movie', 'wish', 'epic', 'even', 'was', 'given', 'same', 'treatment.You', 'had', 'sych', 'historical', 'recordings', 'Doors', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'last', 'libe', 'stage', 'peformance', 'sounded', 'great', 'Jim', 'didnt', 'want', 'spot', 'lights', 'band', 'are', 'shown', 'playing', 'almost', 'total', 'darkness', 'when', 'do', 'End', 'just', 'great', 'feeling', 'song', 'wish', 'showed', 'more', 'Doors', 'release', 'complete', 'performance', 'them.One', 'thing', 'like', 'film', 'was', 'realism', 'get', 'so', 'sick', 'hearing', 'wooodstock', 'was', '3', 'days', 'Peace', 'LOve', '.BS', 'hippies', 'crashed', 'fences', 'didnt', 'give', 'crap', 'promoters', 'other', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'put', 'festival', 'Feeling', 'can', 'just', 'storm', 'not', 'have', 'pay', 'event', 'just', 'stiff', 'promoters', 'have', 'dig', 'own', 'pockets', 'pay', 'artists', 'everything', 'else', 'Woodstock', 'promoters', 'already', 'had', 'film', 'record', 'deal', 'signed', 'wasnt', 'too', 'concernd', 'tickets', 'still', 'took', 'huge', 'financial', 'hit', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'same', 'crap', 'young', 'punks', 'tearing', 'down', 'fences', 'get', 'too', 'cheap', 'tom', 'pay', '3', 'pounds', 'kill', 'crashing', 'fences', 'cost', 'promoters', 'asses', 'Great', 'documentary', 'so', 'called', 'love', 'child', 'generation', 'were', 'just', 'selfish', 'spoiled', 'ME', 'generation', 'same', 'crap', 'different', 'title.Wish', 'film', 'were', 'longer', 'what']",Message to Love - The Isle of Wight Festival
188687,A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,1573306932,"Bill Your 'Free Form FM Print DJ ""bill nicholas""","[0, 1]","Certain short moments change everything. One was when the promoters of Woodstock declared the massive concert a free show. Some say that August 1969 weekend was the apex of the hippie dream: a communal and no cost weekend of peace, love, flowers, and music.People tend to forget that Woodstock was declared a disaster area and that the New York State National Guard was called in to distribute food. The promoters of the festival took an absolute money bath. The Who almost didn't get paid, and it was not until the film and album came out in 1970 that Wooodstock made money.You know what else can change everything? Hell. That is how Jerry Garcia described what happened  four months later, when in December, the Rolling Stones asked the Hell's Angels to provide security at their festival at the Altamont Speedway, which they hoped would be Woodstock West. Every creepo in Calafornia seemed to show up that weekend-I love the imbecile whining outside the Stones  trailer like a three-year-old ""I wanna see Mick Jagger, G-dammit""- and were beaten with pool cues by the Angels. Paul Kantner of Jefforson Airplane got knocked out, and a fan with a gun, Maradith Hunter, was killed. To see this mess, getGimme ShelterYet somehow, promoters in England sought to try it all again in 1970, and thus held the Isle Of Wight Festival. This show had sets by The Who, Jimi Hendrix,The Doors, Jethro Tull, and Family, among a lot of other rock and folk royalty of the era.These sets are documented on this  DVD, along with the behind the scenes workings of this massive undertaking.Message To Love is a fascinating look at why the Woodstock Dream did not and could not make it past the 1960s. Not even past December 1969. Even in the counterculture days of 1970, rock royalty expected to be paid. Paid well.The problem: fans who came to Isle of White did not seem to get that putting on a massive rock concert was a massive financial and logistical undertaking. They wanted Woodstock In England.  They wanted communal utopia. They didn't understand why they had to pay to get in.'Can you blame them. Maybe. Maybe not. In 1970, rock was politics, money was politics, and rock festivals were, most absolutely politics. Massive showings of hippie potential set to music. It seems laughable in 2010, but there was a real tension between hippies, capitalists, and hippie capitalists. This is best shown when Joni Mitchel sits on stage, tries to calm the crowd, make sense of what was going on.No one was killed at Isle of Wight. There was no riot. Despite the anxiety about potential disaster that seems to run through the film, the disaster never came. Isle of Wight was unfortunately no Woodstock, and blessedly, no Altamont.But if you enjoy the music, or if you enjoy the story, Message To Love works either way. A movie about  when rock and youth thought they could change the world, and why they actually couldn't, so very long ago.",5,Classic,1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,2921,"['Certain', 'short', 'moments', 'change', 'everything', 'One', 'was', 'when', 'promoters', 'Woodstock', 'declared', 'massive', 'concert', 'free', 'show', 'say', 'August', '1969', 'weekend', 'was', 'apex', 'hippie', 'dream', 'communal', 'cost', 'weekend', 'peace', 'love', 'flowers', 'music.People', 'tend', 'forget', 'Woodstock', 'was', 'declared', 'disaster', 'area', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'National', 'Guard', 'was', 'called', 'distribute', 'food', 'promoters', 'festival', 'took', 'absolute', 'money', 'bath', 'Who', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'paid', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'album', 'came', 'out', '1970', 'Wooodstock', 'made', 'money.You', 'know', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'change', 'everything', 'Hell', 'how', 'Jerry', 'Garcia', 'described', 'what', 'happened', 'four', 'months', 'later', 'when', 'December', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'asked', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'provide', 'security', 'festival', 'Altamont', 'Speedway', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'Woodstock', 'West', 'Every', 'creepo', 'Calafornia', 'seemed', 'show', 'up', 'weekend-I', 'imbecile', 'whining', 'Stones', 'trailer', 'three-year-old', 'wan', 'see', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'G-dammit', 'were', 'beaten', 'pool', 'cues', 'Angels', 'Paul', 'Kantner', 'Jefforson', 'Airplane', 'got', 'knocked', 'out', 'fan', 'gun', 'Maradith', 'Hunter', 'was', 'killed', 'see', 'mess', 'getGimme', 'ShelterYet', 'somehow', 'promoters', 'England', 'sought', 'try', 'again', '1970', 'thus', 'held', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'Festival', 'show', 'had', 'sets', 'Who', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Doors', 'Jethro', 'Tull', 'Family', 'lot', 'other', 'rock', 'folk', 'royalty', 'era.These', 'sets', 'are', 'documented', 'DVD', 'scenes', 'workings', 'massive', 'undertaking.Message', 'Love', 'fascinating', 'look', 'why', 'Woodstock', 'Dream', 'did', 'not', 'could', 'not', 'make', '1960s', 'Not', 'even', 'December', '1969', 'Even', 'counterculture', 'days', '1970', 'rock', 'royalty', 'expected', 'be', 'paid', 'Paid', 'well.The', 'problem', 'fans', 'who', 'came', 'Isle', 'White', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'get', 'putting', 'massive', 'rock', 'concert', 'was', 'massive', 'financial', 'logistical', 'undertaking', 'wanted', 'Woodstock', 'England', 'wanted', 'communal', 'utopia', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'had', 'pay', 'get', 'blame', 'Maybe', 'Maybe', 'not', '1970', 'rock', 'was', 'politics', 'money', 'was', 'politics', 'rock', 'festivals', 'were', 'most', 'absolutely', 'politics', 'Massive', 'showings', 'hippie', 'potential', 'set', 'music', 'laughable', '2010', 'there', 'was', 'real', 'tension', 'hippies', 'capitalists', 'hippie', 'capitalists', 'best', 'shown', 'when', 'Joni', 'Mitchel', 'stage', 'calm', 'crowd', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'one', 'was', 'killed', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'was', 'riot', 'anxiety', 'potential', 'disaster', 'run', 'film', 'disaster', 'never', 'came', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'Woodstock', 'blessedly', 'Altamont.But', 'enjoy', 'music', 'enjoy', 'story', 'Message', 'Love', 'works', 'way', 'movie', 'when', 'rock', 'youth', 'thought', 'could', 'change', 'world', 'why', 'actually', 'could', ""n't"", 'so', 'very', 'long', 'ago']",Message to Love - The Isle of Wight Festival
188688,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,1573306932,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 1]","Due to numerous issues, ""Message To Love: The Isle of Wight Festival"" didn't reach theaters until 1997. Not sure if it was worth the wait. The 1970 multi-day concert it covers was so gargantuan that it would have been better served with a three-hour running time. Clocking in at 127 minutes, ""Message To Love"" feels incomplete, with multiple performers making rushed cameo appearances. Additional footage (and perhaps modern day interviews) is needed to fully detail the complex chaos of this festival.The 1960's concert documentary first appeared on the scene withMonterey Pop - Criterion Collectionin 1968. Multi-day concerts were a phenomenon of the 60s, emerging from the well of youth, music and anti-Vietnam War rebellion during the Summer of Love 1967. What began with Monterey Pop arguably ended in England at this Isle of Wight Fest three years later. ""Message To Love"" is an intentional contrast toWoodstock - 3 Days of Peace & Music (The Director's Cut), the documentary of an equally gigantic fest held a year before in New York. By the end of that brilliant film, which runs three-plus hours, one is blissfully exhausted with the unique feeling of having been a part of those famous days. ""Message To Love"" does not capture a similar, overall essence of its event.The film intentionally details the ugliness of what these festivals became. Promoters hoped to turn a profit, with the event attracting an astounding 600,000 British and American fans for five days of music on the island off the coast of England. Promoters designed an ill-fated system of fences, manned by guards and dogs, in an attempt to force attendees to pay admission. ""Message To Love"" accurately shows the hippie's efforts at tearing down these fences (it's always the fences). According to them, this was their ""festival"" and they were not going to participate in ""evil"" capitalism. Ironically, the bands would not perform unless paid in advance, and eventually promoter Rikki Farr (a true character) throws up his hands in frustration, accepting financial loss.The lineup was perhaps the most interesting in history, including Jimi HendrixIsle of Wight '70(just days before his death), The DoorsThe Doors Collection (Collector's Edition)(with one of Jim Morrison's final performances), The WhoLive At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970 (Special Edition), Miles Davis, Donovan, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Kris Kristofferson, John Sebastian and Ten Years After. Young acts on the verge of becoming 70's staples included Tiny Tim, Free (with a young Paul Rodgers), The Moody Blues, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Leonard Cohen and Jethro Tull. Additional performers, including Chicago, Melanie, Supertramp, Richie Havens and Sly & The Family Stone are sadly (and unwisely) left on the cutting room floor. With few exceptions, none of the acts are documented particularly well, and the coverage provided Davis, Donovan and Baez is criminally short. This concert was a unique musical bridge connecting the 60s to the 70s, though this is only hinted at.The camera weaves through the audience on occasion (though not enough), mainly to the caravan of gypsy-hippies camped on the hill overlooking the festival. Most fans interviewed are British, having adopted the aura of rebellion from the States. The most violent protesters are, interestingly, the Americans. They are a rough mob threatening the guards while contemplating their own drug use (and shockingly that of their children) next to damp campfires.With the exception of The Moody Blues'Classic Moody Bluesperformance of ""Nights In White Satin,"" the live acts are surprisingly uninspiring, owing much to the odd pillbox-like stage they were forced to perform in. Contrasted with the sweeping, outdoor stage of Woodstock, it's no wonder fans became restless. The Who and Ten Years AfterAnthology 1967-1971are fine as usual. Even Jim Morrison, now adorned in the long beard of his later career, has an animated moment as he smiles at Robby Krieger during ""The End."" Still, there's a rushed feeling to ""Message To Love."" The scene of the elderly hippie interrupting Joni Mitchell'sBig Yellow Taxiperformance to rant on stage about the fences is a highlight. The incident reduces Mitchell to tears while backstage, in what is one of the film's most extraordinary scenes, the manic hippie, eyes dilated, spouts nonsense in an apparent acid-induced frenzy. With much trouble, he his forcefully escorted away, arms and legs flailing about.""Message To Love"" is missing similar intimate detail to properly flesh out these closing, final days of acid and roses. There was an opportunity here for historical greatness. The great abundance of magic and misery could have been better conveyed.",3,The Magic and the Misery,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,4708,"['Due', 'numerous', 'issues', 'Message', 'Love', 'Isle',

188691,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,1573306932,drkhimxz,"[0, 1]","As is true of some, or many, of the previous Amazon reviewers of this film, if  you expected it to be focused on the music being played, as he did in his films on the Who, Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan (the last named at Newport), you will quite justifiably be disappointed. This is a story of an event, the gathering of 600,000, mostly young people, on an island off the coast of England, to attend a Rock Concert. It is not a filming of a Rock Concert. To my perception, there is minimal attention to that aspect of the Happening, save as it  showed something about the totality of the event. That may not be to your liking, it may be a weaker film than if it had taken the focus many potential viewers prefer, but, there you are. He made the film he set out to make (whatever may be the unexplained reasons for doing so) and forbore making the film that  he has shown  he can create with excellence.While I, too, expected a film similar to the one on Dylan, which I saw recently, the real purpose became evident within a short time after the scene setting opening. For me the shift in direction of my attention did not frustrate me, since it gave me a chance to see what his raw materials allowed him to show about crowd events, differences in reactions among performers,and differences between performers and management. Unfortunately. he was limited by the obvious fact that it is not possible to add footage after 20 years lag (the period in which the raw film was simmering before Lerner was able to get a commission to do the job). What he had on hand was what he had to work with(and, happily, he did not interview participants twenty years after the fact which can often be an exercise in collecting distorted memories). How good is the end product. Quite good for a television special, quite inadequate for an in-depth study of interesting hypotheses which emerge from what is shown in the film. I give it an above average rating because it should be of considerable interest to viewers who have read and seen interviews and remembrances of the events, without having a chance to see any part of these events themselves.If you want to see the largest event of its kind in Rock history, Isle of Wright had fifty percent more people than Woodstock, this is probably the best (non-fiction) film you are going to see on the subject. If you expect in-depth analysis, you will have to search the academic literature (as I have not).

Here we get a fascinating clash between dopeheads, anarchists and hippies demanding a free concert, whereas their pop music heroes are demanding to be paid before they perform.Tiny Tim comes off particularly badly, saying to camera that he thinks a free concert is a great idea. But then the concert organiser admits that Tiny Tim won't pick up his ukulele until he gets paid. Joan Baez is more honest and less two-faced about it, but she has no solution to the financial problem. She does expect to get paid.Eventually the rabble wins and, after clashes with police dogs etc, tears down the corrugated metal fences. Even the concert promoter's spokesman finally admits defeat and says everyone can come in, now that they know they'll never break even.Sociologists may well wince along with most viewers when one dopehead admits that he gives his young son (who looks about five) marijuana and LSD.But what a fantastic concert it was. Quite apart from this providing the last ever appearances by Hendrix and Jim Morrison, there were also some superb performances, particularly by the Who. (The interplay between drummer Keith Moon and guitarist Pete Townshend is telepathic.) Free are OK, but they are not well-miked. There is also the humdrum: Rory Gallagher with a very mediocre song, an extended Miles Davis band (which included Chick Corea and possibly Keith Jarrett) providing an excerpt which was all too brief. Joni Mitchell deserved gets two songs on this DVD, after telling the crowd that they are behaving like tourists.There is the nudity and unscripted on-stage behaviour that you might expect from crowds of the period. But what this film does so well is focus not just on the dirtiness of attending an outdoor concert for several days, but also on the problems of managing the event.

For example,  I am a disappointed Miles Davis fan (his segment lasts about a minute),  while the footage of another of my musical favorites (Joni Mitchell) is  preoccupied with her tearful reaction to an impatient crowd rather than her  music.Too many of the featured artists (Tull, Miles, Joni, etc.) have  loyal followings that would warrant an alternative multi-volume edition  featuring their complete performances (this has already happened with sets  by Hendrix and The Who).  That would release this movie from the inflated  expectations of fans who've waited up to a quarter-century to hopefully see  significant chunks of the artists' sets.

The Isle of Wight Festival is important for several reasons, among which is that it was among the last performances of both Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix. Further, the festival was, like Woodstock and the Festival Train, an odd mix of success and failure.  Financially, these were all a failure.  In terms of demonstrating the ideals of the late '60s - that music and emotion could create something beautiful - these festivals were also (to varying degrees) a failure.  Yet, the music was fantastic and the events became living things, as important in terms of history as in art.  As this film shows, any attempt at orchestrating and scripting the event was thwarted by the ""event"" itself.  We see people appropriating the stage, tearing down walls, dancing, etc.  We see artists leave the stage in disgust and we see others plead with the audience.  We see the behind-the scenes, the organizers frustrated with artists and with the crowd.  Ultimately, we see resolution as a large number of individuals brought together finally learn to accept each other.  This is a movie without the sugar-coating and it borders on shocking at times.In terms of the selection of artists, there are some great performances here and no single artist is really spotlighted.  I wish that there was additional footage, even as special features.  Further, the transition between the performances and the crowd (something handled very well in Woodstock - though a different director) is sometimes a bit abrupt, giving the film a bit of a choppy feel.There are (at present) two companion films available separately, presenting the complete performances of The Who and Jimi Hendrix.  In these films, the director (Murray Lerner) likewise includes some behind-the-scenes footage of the organizers, providing some nice context, though the full meaning of these snippets is really gained after watching Message To Love.  Thus, these companion films extend Message to Love.  I would love to see more of these complete performances (Jethro Tull springs to mind, and I saw that a cd of their performance was recently released).  Further, I would like to see a box set of the Isle of Wight material - Message To Love + the complete performance materials.Anyway, despite a bit of choppiness, I recommend this disc.  Mr. Lerner included a fine mix of major and minor (retrospectively speaking) artists and a good bit of context via the behind-the-scenes transitions.  Whereas this disc doesn't have the smoothness of Woodstock or Monterey Pop, for example, the inclusion of overlooked artists and ""the ugly side"" perhaps make this a more truthful documentary.  There are enough fine performances to please the music fan and enough context for the historian alike.",4,"Great music, great selection, but choppy presentation",1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,2773,"['documentary', 'dvd', 'excellent', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'Festival', 'important', 'several', 'reasons', 'was', 'last', 'performances', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Further', 'festival', 'was', 'Woodstock', 'Festival', 'Train', 'odd', 'mix', 'success', 'failure', 'Financially', 'were', 'failure', 'terms', 'demonstrating', 'ideals', 'late', ""'60s"", 'music', 'emotion', 'could', 'create', 'something', 'beautiful', 'festivals', 'were', 'also', 'varying', 'degrees', 'failure', 'music', 'was', 'fantastic', 'events', 'became', 'living', 'things', 'important', 'terms', 'history', 'art', 'film', 'attempt', 'orchestrating', 'scripting', 'event', 'was', 'thwarted', 'event', 'see', 'people', 'appropriating', 'stage', 'tearing', 'down', 'walls', 'dancing', 'etc', 'see', 'artists', 'leave', 'stage', 'disgust', 'see', 'others', 'plead', 'audience', 'see', 'behind-the', 'scenes', 'organizers', 'frustrated', 'artists', 'crowd', 'Ultimately', 'see', 'resolution', 'large', 'number', 'individuals', 'brought', 'together', 'finally', 'learn', 'accept', 'other', 'movie', 'sugar-coating', 'shocking', 'times.In', 'terms', 'selection', 'artists', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'here', 'single', 'artist', 'really', 'spotlighted', 'wish', 'was', 'additional', 'footage', 'even', 'special', 'features', 'Further', 'transition', 'performances', 'crowd', 'something', 'handled', 'very', 'well', 'Woodstock', 'different', 'director', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'abrupt', 'giving', 'film', 'bit', 'choppy', 'feel.There', 'are', 'present', 'two', 'companion', 'films', 'available', 'separately', 'presenting', 'complete', 'performances', 'Who', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'films', 'director', 'Murray', 'Lerner', 'likewise', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'organizers', 'providing', 'nice', 'context', 'full', 'meaning', 'snippets', 'really', 'gained', 'watching', 'Message', 'Love', 'Thus', 'companion', 'films', 'extend', 'Message', 'Love', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'complete', 'performances', 'Jethro', 'Tull', 'springs', 'mind', 'saw', 'cd', 'performance', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'Further', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'box', 'set', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'material', 'Message', 'Love', 'complete', 'performance', 'materials.Anyway', 'bit', 'choppiness', 'recommend', 'disc', 'Mr.', 'Lerner', 'included', 'fine', 'mix', 'major', 'minor', 'retrospectively', 'speaking', 'artists', 'good', 'bit', 'context', 'behind-the-scenes', 'transitions', 'disc', ""n't"", 'have', 'smoothness', 'Woodstock', 'Monterey', 'Pop', 'example', 'inclusion', 'overlooked', 'artists', 'ugly', 'side', 'perhaps', 'make', 'more', 'truthful', 'documentary', 'are', 'enough', 'fine', 'performances', 'please', 'music', 'fan', 'enough', 'context', 'historian', 'alike']",Message to Love - The Isle of Wight Festival
188704,A20Q1ROFHUY91A,1573306932,Sandoz,"[1, 1]","OK, there's no denying this documentary does a good job of capturing the spirit of the time in which the festival occurred--we get plenty of interviews with scraggly hippies in the crowd voicing their opinions about how the concert should be free to the people and how their love for the music is being exploited by the man--yet when it comes to respectfully showcasing that very music what do we end up with? Abbreviated, often truncated versions of timeless, classic performances that I'm positive was the reason the majority of the buyers of this DVD purchased the disc in the first place.From a bit of research, it appears this first turned up on VHS tape back in the mid-90's so its two hour length makes sense when considering the limitations of that medium (a two-hour, SP speed videotape was considered about the maximum length to get good video/audio reproduction without causing undue stress on the tape). However, when it came time to put this on DVD, it seems there was no extra effort to put out a proper release of this event, one that should have necessitated at the very least restoring the FULL-LENGTH versions of the majority of songs that appear in this movie. With all the great musical performers at this show, there is definitely a guaranteed market to return this minor investment and probably negate the very criticisms that I'm mentioning here.Not only that, but the DVD is two-sided with each side only running an hour in length. Um, wtf? Why double-side it when a single side of a DVD can easily hold 2 hours worth of material? I know this DVD has been marked-down for sale at under $10 at most sites, so it's not a tremendous burden to purchase if you absolutely must obtain it, but still it's sad the missed opportunity they had here to release something that could have joined Gimme Shelter and Woodstock as a great document of a key musical and cultural event that was presented with the best modern technology can offer.To quote the very words that someone voices during the film, ""we blew it.""",3,Shoddy DVD,1293235200,"12 25, 2010",2010,2026,"['OK', 'denying', 'documentary', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'time', 'festival', 'occurred', 'get', 'plenty', 'interviews', 'scraggly', 'hippies', 'crowd', 'voicing', 'opinions', 'how', 'concert', 'should', 'be', 'free', 'people', 'how', 'love', 'music', 'being', 'exploited', 'man', 'yet', 'when', 'respectfully', 'showcasing', 'very', 'music', 'what', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'Abbreviated', 'often', 'truncated', 'versions', 'timeless', 'classic', 'performances', ""'m"", 'positive', 'was', 'reason', 'majority', 'buyers', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'disc', 'first', 'place.From', 'bit', 'research', 'first', 'turned', 'up', 'VHS', 'tape', 'back', 'mid-90', 'two', 'hour', 'length', 'sense', 'when', 'considering', 'limitations', 'medium', 'two-hour', 'SP', 'speed', 'videotape', 'was', 'considered', 'maximum', 'length', 'get', 'good', 'video/audio', 'reproduction', 'causing', 'undue', 'stress', 'tape', 'However', 'when', 'came', 'time', 'put', 'DVD', 'was', 'extra', 'effort', 'put', 'out', 'proper', 'release', 'event', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'necessitated', 'very', 'least', 'restoring', 'FULL-LENGTH', 'versions', 'majority', 'songs', 'appear', 'movie', 'great', 'musical', 'performers', 'show', 'definitely', 'guaranteed', 'market', 'return', 'minor', 'investment', 'probably', 'negate', 'very', 'criticisms', ""'m"", 'mentioning', 'here.Not', 'only', 'DVD', 'two-sided', 'side', 'only', 'running', 'hour', 'length', 'Um', 'wtf', 'Why', 'double-side', 'when', 'single', 'side', 'DVD', 'can', 'easily', 'hold', '2', 'hours', 'worth', 'material', 'know', 'DVD', 'been', 'marked-down', 'sale', '10', 'most', 'sites', 'not', 'tremendous', 'burden', 'purchase', 'absolutely', 'must', 'obtain', 'still', 'sad', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'had', 'here', 'release', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'joined', 'Gim', 'Shelter', 'Woodstock', 'great', 'document', 'key', 'musical', 'cultural', 'event', 'was', 'presented', 'best', 'modern', 'technology', 'can', 'offer.To', 'quote', 'very', 'words', 'someone', 'voices', 'film', 'blew']",Message to Love - The Isle of Wight Festival

The Isle of Wight festival and the one later with the Rolling Stones (for which Hells Angels were hired as bouncers) certainly fed that iconoclasm.As to the production quality of this film, it was quite well done. I regret slightly that the musical performances were broken up. For instance, I think there were two of Hendrix and two of The Who. That's instead of a section for each performer, as I assume the show proceeded. But I'll survive that.And they were well photographed. (The split-screen in Woodstock was a little disconcerting, expecially if you're trying to describe to someone who knows nothing of how to make a film that there are NOT twin Alvin Lees! That was not an issue in this film.) The ones who stick out for me are Ten Years After, Jethro Tull and The Who--and even Hendrix, in his performance 18 days before he died. Sorry, by the way, for Doors fans. They did little more for me in this film than they did any other time. (I'm afraid I find them the most overrated band of the era!)As a documentary it echoed my cynicism of an era of which I was part: People spending probably somewhere between $600 and $1000 to fly to United Kingdom, and all the paperwork, passport, etc., that it all involved, then not being willing to pay 3 pounds for a concert ticket.Yeah, sure. It was all part of the ""revolution,"" when performers even in those days made thousands a gig (and ten times that now!)Yeah, rock festivals WERE products of youth culture, which means a lot of sanctimony, being caught in the symbols of the revolution, etc. (Don't worry, folks. (1) I'm including myself in that criticism and (2) I haven't reacted by becoming a right-wing demagogue like some former members of the ""culture""!)It certainly offers a balance to those of us who fantasize ""The 60s"" as if it were a golden age. Yes, it DID have its weaknesses, as do any human endeavors.Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the old guy, apparently retired MI5 or something, who talks about how this is how communism strikes. Variations on that theme have pervaded modern music, or the youth culture since its beginning--probably since before recorded history. But that guy added a little color the film needed.Overall I recommend this as an example of the darker side of an era of which we still can be proud, keeping what I've said in context.",4,"Good, but a little depressing",1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,2436,"['being', 'Woodstock', 'fan', 'i.e.', 'fantasy', 'nice', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'little', 'iconoclast', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'festival', 'one', 'later', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Hells', 'Angels', 'were', 'hired', 'bouncers', 'certainly', 'fed', 'iconoclasm.As', 'production', 'quality', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'regret', 'slightly', 'musical', 'performances', 'were', 'broken', 'up', 'instance', 'think', 'were', 'two', 'Hendrix', 'two', 'Who', 'instead', 'section', 'performer', 'assume', 'show', 'proceeded', ""'ll"", 'survive', 'that.And', 'were', 'well', 'photographed', 'split-screen', 'Woodstock', 'was', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'expecially', ""'re"", 'trying', 'describe', 'someone', 'who', 'nothing', 'how', 'make', 'film', 'are', 'NOT', 'twin', 'Alvin', 'Lees', 'was', 'not', 'issue', 'film', 'ones', 'who', 'stick', 'out', 'are', 'Ten', 'Years', 'Jethro', 'Tull', 'Who', 'even', 'Hendrix', 'performance', '18', 'days', 'died', 'Sorry', 'way', 'Doors', 'fans', 'did', 'little', 'more', 'film', 'did', 'other', 'time', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'find', 'most', 'overrated', 'band', 'era', 'documentary', 'echoed', 'cynicism', 'era', 'was', 'part', 'People', 'spending', 'probably', 'somewhere', '600', '1000', 'fly', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'paperwork', 'passport', 'etc.', 'involved', 'then', 'not', 'being', 'willing', 'pay', '3', 'pounds', 'concert', 'ticket.Yeah', 'sure', 'was', 'part', 'revolution', 'when', 'performers', 'even', 'days', 'made', 'thousands', 'gig', 'ten', 'times', 'now', 'Yeah', 'rock', 'festivals', 'WERE', 'products', 'youth', 'culture', 'lot', 'sanctimony', 'being', 'caught', 'symbols', 'revolution', 'etc', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'folks', '1', ""'m"", 'including', 'criticism', '2', 'have', ""n't"", 'reacted', 'becoming', 'right-wing', 'demagogue', 'former', 'members', 'culture', 'certainly', 'balance', 'who', 'fantasize', '60s', 'were', 'golden', 'age', 'Yes', 'DID', 'have', 'weaknesses', 'do', 'human', 'endeavors.Oh', 'almost', 'forgot', 'mention', 'old', 'guy', 'apparently', 'retired', 'MI5', 'something', 'who', 'how', 'how', 'communism', 'Variations', 'theme', 'have', 'pervaded', 'modern', 'music', 'youth', 'culture', 'beginning', 'probably', 'before', 'recorded', 'history', 'guy', 'added', 'little', 'color', 'film', 'needed.Overall', 'recommend', 'example', 'darker', 'side', 'era', 'still', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'keeping', 'what', ""'ve"", 'said', 'context']",Message to Love - The Isle of Wight Festival

Langan ""take403""","[49, 55]","Most of the performances are good, although a little too brief (and some songs are probably edited), which is why I had to dock this review one star.  This is more of a documentary of the event than anything else.  You'll see the promoters and the crowd get almost as much time on the camera as the performers.  The Isle of Wight wasn't exactly Britain's answer to Woodstock (Altamont ended the Woodstock spirit and this is Hippydom's last true hurrah), but still a great festival.This has poignant moments, like Jimi Hendrix' final performance featuring ""Message to Love,"" ""Machine Gun"" and ""Voodoo Chile (Slight Return),"" one of the Doors' final performances (Jim Morrison looks sad and out of it) featuring ""When the Music's Over"" and ""The End"" and Joni Mitchell bursting out in tears after one rambunctious hippie interrupts her set while playing ""Woodstock"" (he's lucky he didn't try interrupting the Who's set!).  She carries on singing ""Big Yellow Taxi.""  After instances like Altamont, the promoters add security like a metal fence dividing the young teens and adults (some English, some American) who've paid admission and those who haven't and police dogs.  So, naturally, there's plenty of arguments between the promoters and the music fans.  Due to the war between them, Kris Kristoferson is unduly booed onstage.  Folks are too busy trying to get in to listen to the original ""Me and Bobbie McGee.""  Joan Baez, after her performance of ""Let It Be"" is interviewed.  She's honest and says ""This is my job, so naturally, I expect to be paid.""  A humorous moment is Tiny Tim singing via megaphone ""There'll Always Be An England.""  A sad moment is when one hippie says he's given his young son LSD (nowadays, a social worker would probably take the son away from him). It's amusing to see a young thin Ian Anderson perform with Jethro Tull (""Whoever said we wouldn't perform tonight is full of..."") on ""My Sunday Feeeling"" and a young thin Paul Rogers perform ""All Right Now"" with Free.  This is also Emerson, Lake and Palmer's debut performance (each of them celebrates in full flamboyance by Emerson nearly destroying his organ, Lake setting off a cannon and Palmer removing his shirt while performing ""Pictures at an Exhibition/Blue Rondo a la Turk"").  It's also one of the Moody Blues' 1st performances live.  Fortunately for the freeloaders (nowadays one would find it extraordinary that they would spend a lot of money on crossing the boat to the Isle and not schill out 3 English pounds), the fence is taken down and all hold hands in peace, while a guitar plays ""Amazing Grace.""  You really sympathize with Rikki (one of the emcees), as he bears his heart with the audience that he and the other promoters will have lots of fees to pay for this decision.  As the festival comes to end, Rikki later sums it all up when he says ""This is the last great event.""  One of the carpenters looks a little like Jerry Garcia!An edition with more complete performances would be great in the future.  In the meantime, this will have to do.  By the way, this is a 2 sided disk (at least my copy is) and if it ends with Joni Mitchell singing ""Big Yellow Taxi,"" turn the disk over and you'll get Miles Davis and the rest of the program.",4,"""Whoever knocks down the fence gets a free ball!""",1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,3236,"['Most', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'little', 'too', 'brief', 'songs', 'are', 'probably', 'edited', 'why', 'had', 'dock', 'review', 'one', 'star', 'more', 'documentary', 'event', 'anything', 'else', ""'ll"", 'see', 'promoters', 'crowd', 'get', 'almost', 'much', 'time', 'camera', 'performers', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'Britain', 'answer', 'Woodstock', 'Altamont', 'ended', 'Woodstock', 'spirit', 'Hippydom', 'last', 'true', 'hurrah', 'still', 'great', 'festival.This', 'poignant', 'moments', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'final', 'performance', 'featuring', 'Message', 'Love', 'Machine', 'Gun', 'Voodoo', 'Chile', 'Slight', 'Return', 'one', 'Doors', 'final', 'performances', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'sad', 'featuring', 'When', 'Music', 'Over', 'End', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'bursting', 'out', 'tears', 'one', 'rambunctious', 'hippie', 'set', 'playing', 'Woodstock', 'lucky', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'interrupting', 'Who', 'set', 'singing', 'Big', 'Yellow', 'Taxi', 'instances', 'Altamont', 'promoters', 'add', 'security', 'metal', 'fence', 'dividing', 'young', 'teens', 'adults', 'English', 'American', 'who', ""'ve"", 'paid', 'admission', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'police', 'dogs', 'So', 'naturally', 'plenty', 'arguments', 'promoters', 'music', 'fans', 'Due', 'war', 'Kris', 'Kristoferson', 'unduly', 'booed', 'onstage', 'Folks', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'trying', 'get', 'listen', 'original', 'Me', 'Bobbie', 'McGee', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'performance', 'Let', 'Be', 'interviewed', 'honest', 'job', 'so', 'naturally', 'expect', 'be', 'paid', 'humorous', 'moment', 'Tiny', 'Tim', 'singing', 'megaphone', ""'ll"", 'Always', 'Be', 'England', 'sad', 'moment', 'when', 'one', 'hippie', 'given', 'young', 'son', 'LSD', 'nowadays', 'social', 'worker', 'would', 'probably', 'take', 'son', 'away', 'amusing', 'see', 'young', 'thin', 'Ian', 'Anderson', 'perform', 'Jethro', 'Tull', 'Whoever', 'said', 'would', ""n't"", 'perform', 'tonight', 'full', 'Sunday', 'Feeeling', 'young', 'thin', 'Paul', 'Rogers', 'perform', 'Right', 'Now', 'Free', 'also', 'Emerson', 'Lake', 'Palmer', 'debut', 'performance', 'celebrates', 'full', 'flamboyance', 'Emerson', 'nearly', 'destroying', 'organ', 'Lake', 'setting', 'off', 'cannon', 'Palmer', 'removing', 'shirt', 'performing', 'Pictures', 'Exhibition/Blue', 'Rondo', 'la', 'Turk', 'also', 'one', 'Moody', 'Blues', '1st', 'performances', 'live', 'Fortunately', 'freeloaders', 'one', 'would', 'find', 'extraordinary', 'would', 'spend', 'lot', 'money', 'crossing', 'boat', 'Isle', 'not', 'schill', 'out', '3', 'English', 'pounds', 'fence', 'taken', 'down', 'hold', 'hands', 'peace', 'guitar', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'really', 'sympathize', 'Rikki', 'one', 'emcees', 'heart', 'audience', 'other', 'promoters', 'will', 'have', 'lots', 'fees', 'pay', 'decision', 'festival', 'end', 'Rikki', 'later', 'sums', 'up', 'when', 'last', 'great', 'event', 'One', 'carpenters', 'little', 'Jerry', 'Garcia', 'edition', 'more', 'complete', 'performances', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'future', 'meantime', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'way', '2', 'sided', 'disk', 'least', 'copy', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'singing', 'Big', 'Yellow', 'Taxi', 'turn', 'disk', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'rest', 'program']",Message to Love - The Isle of Wight Festival
