1289443,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B002U4F5W2,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[8, 10]","Bliss is a story, and based on a novel, where the theme is honor killing.  Although not nearly as frightening asThe Stoning of Soraya M,  Bliss carries the intensity, fear and suspense.  The opening scenes are saddened;  Meryem, 17, is raped in the village, and she will not reveal the killer, only indicating saying she does not remember.  Traditionally, in Turkey, it is assumed to her fault and in order to stop further gossiping and disgrace upon the family, she is encouraged to kill herself.  When that doesn't happen, her father sets out to have her killed.Bliss demonstrates the strength and conviction of a girl adamantly against Turkish traditions, defiant that she can not and will not kill herself.  It is the conflict between the old and the young.It is her cousin Cemal, who is to take the girl to Istanbul to do the job.  From here on, the tension starts mounting, as we fear for the girl who is in the hands of the one to kill her.  Their journey is tense, unpredictable, through a beautiful Turkish backdrop.  However, as they move on Cemal's feelings have shifted.  During their journey, Cemal and Meryem become entangled in the life of a professor whose boat they take refuge.  We learn why he is adrift and involved in a marital dispute.  Meanwhile, the dramatic action continues as  her family remains on the lookout.Prepare for a shocking twist.....

1289445,A17VSVIHLVFOC6,B002U4F5W2,ateo,"[1, 1]","Wow, this movie really moved me and left me with a feeling of bliss, especially after watching THE STONING OF SORAYA M. which was also powerful and good but a downer. I loved everything about this movie, the story telling, the characters, the actors, the cinematography. A work of cinematic art for humanity.I can see how ignorant people with prejudice against muslims can see a movie like this (or another movie like THE STONING OF SORAYA M., which was based on actual events which took place in a small rural village in Iran) and use it to demonize muslims, but I don't think that was the motive of the filmmaker, or  Traditional Turks: BAAAD! ; Modern Turks: GOOOD! It looks to me the filmmaker was just trying to bring awareness and outrage of the particular atrocity of HONOR KILLINGS. Although I'm sure most islamic villagers are decent people, the fact of the matter is, honor killings do occur in the muslim world, it is a phenomenon, I'm sure it happens in other cultures and religions too, and when it does happen, its more likely to happen in the more backward under developed rural areas, where semi feudal social relations and patriarchy remain stronger and police authority has little presence.And I don't think any socially conscious rational sober individual would watch this and believe that females aren't raped, brutalized, or degraded in different forms in modern western culture as well. And I must say that if christian fundamentalists ever create a full blown christian theocracy it would look very similar to afghanistan under Taliban rule or as it was depicted in the fictional novel/movie ""THE HANDMAID'S TALE"".In conclusion, I think the writer and director did a good job creating this powerful and moving story. Particularly the aspect of a young man overcoming  his backward feudalistic patriarchal, what Mao Zedong called the four olds, Old Customs, Old Culture, Old Habits, and Old Ideas. And I'm pretty sure theres many men in modern western culture with similar backward views towards females as the young man, particularly christian fundamentalists.",5,Beautiful powerful moving uplifting story for humanity,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,2083,"['Wow', 'movie', 'really', 'moved', 'left', 'feeling', 'bliss', 'especially', 'watching', 'THE', 'STONING', 'OF', 'SORAYA', 'M.', 'was', 'also', 'powerful', 'good', 'downer', 'loved', 'everything', 'movie', 'story', 'telling', 'characters', 'actors', 'cinematography', 'work', 'cinematic', 'art', 'humanity.I', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'ignorant', 'people', 'prejudice', 'muslims', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'movie', 'THE', 'STONING', 'OF', 'SORAYA', 'M.', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'small', 'rural', 'village', 'Iran', 'use', 'demonize', 'muslims', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'motive', 'filmmaker', 'Traditional', 'Turks', 'BAAAD', 'Modern', 'Turks', 'GOOOD', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'bring', 'awareness', 'outrage', 'particular', 'atrocity', 'HONOR', 'KILLINGS', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'islamic', 'villagers', 'are', 'decent', 'people', 'fact', 'matter', 'honor', 'killings', 'do', 'occur', 'muslim', 'world', 'phenomenon', ""'m"", 'sure', 'other', 'cultures', 'religions', 'too', 'when', 'happen', 'more', 'likely', 'happen', 'more', 'backward', 'developed', 'rural', 'areas', 'where', 'semi', 'feudal', 'social', 'relations', 'patriarchy', 'remain', 'stronger', 'police', 'authority', 'little', 'presence.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'socially', 'conscious', 'rational', 'sober', 'individual', 'would', 'watch', 'believe', 'females', 'are', ""n't"", 'raped', 'brutalized', 'degraded', 'different', 'forms', 'modern', 'western', 'culture', 'well', 'must', 'say', 'christian', 'fundamentalists', 'ever', 'create', 'full', 'blown', 'christian', 'theocracy', 'would', 'look', 'very', 'similar', 'afghanistan', 'Taliban', 'rule', 'was', 'depicted', 'fictional', 'novel/movie', 'THE', 'HANDMAID', 'TALE', '.In', 'conclusion', 'think', 'writer', 'director', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'creating', 'powerful', 'moving', 'story', 'Particularly', 'aspect', 'young', 'man', 'overcoming', 'backward', 'feudalistic', 'patriarchal', 'what', 'Mao', 'Zedong', 'called', 'four', 'olds', 'Old', 'Customs', 'Old', 'Culture', 'Old', 'Habits', 'Old', 'Ideas', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'many', 'men', 'modern', 'western', 'culture', 'similar', 'backward', 'views', 'towards', 'females', 'young', 'man', 'particularly', 'christian', 'fundamentalists']",Bliss
1289446,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B002U4F5W2,Brian E. Erland,"[7, 8]","Note: Presented in Turkish with English subtitles.Introduction: The 2007 release `Bliss' is a fictional tale of a too often acted out reality. This is not a film geared towards a carefree night of family theater, it deals with the serious matter of honor killing as practiced within some sectors of the Muslim culture. The unfortunate target in this story is an attractive young 17 year old village girl named Meryem played expertly by Ozgu Namal.Synopsis: Meryem is a victim of rape perpetrated by an assailant known only to her. Because of the inferior status held by women she is obviously the one at fault and is quickly branded as ""tainted"" and locked away in a room to pray to Allah for forgiveness and hopefully hang herself with the rope so generously provided by her family.When she refuses to kill herself her Father and a village elder decide to assign a young man, Cemal (Murat Han) to escort her to the city and live with friends to alleviate the family from any further shame. Unknown to Merymem the real reason for her journey is not to find a new home, but to be killed by her traveling companion somewhere along the way.As the journey progresses Cemal undergoes an internal struggle between his duty to carry out his mission, his cultural beliefs that condone such a horrible deed as honor killing and his feelings for his vulnerable, innocent girl. Will Cemal be able to convince Meryem to trust him and reveal the truth about what happened and if she does will he believe her story and take her to safety? Or, will he adhere to his cultural tradition and kill her whether he believes her or not?Critique: This is a beautifully produced film. The camera work is superior, the soundtrack haunting and exotic and the storyline solid from beginning to end.  I was also impressed with the acting, the cast was believable and fully engaged in the storyline.In my mind the film is a success if for no other reason than the producer and directors' willingness to deal with such a contemporary and important human rights issue all the while knowing that there would probably be limited audience appeal. What does that say about society-at-large?However that being said, I would also deem the film an artistic success as well, particularly so due to the performance of Ozgu Namal in the role of Meryem. Not only is her physical appearance enough to keep the viewers eyes focused on the screen, but her ability to establish an emotional connection with the audience, hence the storyline, keeps everyone involved and engaged until the very end. And isn't that what any good movie is supposed to do, engage the audience?",5,"""People Get Used To Anything"" ~ At What Cost Honor?",1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,2626,"['Note', 'Presented', 'Turkish', 'English', 'subtitles.Introduction', '2007', 'release', 'Bliss', 'fictional', 'tale', 'too', 'often', 'acted', 'out', 'reality', 'not', 'film', 'geared', 'carefree', 'night', 'family', 'theater', 'serious', 'matter', 'honor', 'killing', 'practiced', 'sectors', 'Muslim', 'culture', 'unfortunate', 'target', 'story', 'attractive', 'young', '17', 'year', 'old', 'village', 'girl', 'named', 'Meryem', 'played', 'expertly', 'Ozgu', 'Namal.Synopsis', 'Meryem', 'victim', 'rape', 'perpetrated', 'assailant', 'known', 'only', 'inferior', 'status', 'held', 'women', 'obviously', 'one', 'fault', 'quickly', 'branded', 'tainted', 'locked', 'away', 'room', 'pray', 'Allah', 'forgiveness', 'hopefully', 'hang', 'rope', 'so', 'generously', 'provided', 'family.When', 'kill', 'Father', 'village', 'elder', 'decide', 'assign', 'young', 'man', 'Cemal', 'Murat', 'Han', 'escort', 'city', 'live', 'friends', 'alleviate', 'family', 'further', 'shame', 'Merymem', 'real', 'reason', 'journey', 'not', 'find', 'new', 'home', 'be', 'killed', 'traveling', 'companion', 'somewhere', 'way.As', 'journey', 'Cemal', 'undergoes', 'internal', 'struggle', 'duty', 'carry', 'out', 'mission', 'cultural', 'beliefs', 'condone', 'horrible', 'deed', 'honor', 'killing', 'feelings', 'vulnerable', 'innocent', 'girl', 'Will', 'Cemal', 'be', 'able', 'convince', 'Meryem', 'trust', 'reveal', 'truth', 'what', 'happened', 'will', 'believe', 'story', 'take', 'safety', 'will', 'adhere', 'cultural', 'tradition', 'kill', 'not', 'Critique', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'film', 'camera', 'work', 'superior', 'soundtrack', 'haunting', 'exotic', 'storyline', 'solid', 'beginning', 'end', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'acting', 'cast', 'was', 'believable', 'fully', 'engaged', 'storyline.In', 'mind', 'film', 'success', 'other', 'reason', 'producer', 'directors', 'willingness', 'deal', 'contemporary', 'important', 'human', 'rights', 'issue', 'while', 'knowing', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'limited', 'audience', 'appeal', 'What', 'say', 'society-at-large', 'However', 'being', 'said', 'would', 'also', 'deem', 'film', 'artistic', 'success', 'as', 'well', 'particularly', 'so', 'due', 'performance', 'Ozgu', 'Namal', 'role', 'Meryem', 'Not', 'only', 'physical', 'appearance', 'enough', 'keep', 'viewers', 'eyes', 'focused', 'screen', 'ability', 'establish', 'emotional', 'connection', 'audience', 'hence', 'storyline', 'everyone', 'involved', 'engaged', 'very', 'end', ""n't"", 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'supposed', 'do', 'engage', 'audience']",Bliss
1289447,ARK5SAGVLW3FY,B002U4F5W2,bunnyrabbit4,"[48, 51]","Bliss is a film about the status and symbolic value of a woman in some Moslem cultures. It is a status so low that they can be murdered by their family if someone rapes them. Meryam is such a woman. After being viciously raped and lacking the money or education to flee her fate, she is forced to follow the son of her father's cousin, Cermal, to Istanbul, where he has been ordered to kill her. This could have easily turned into a bash Islam movie, instead, it becomes a character study of people caught between the modern Islamic world of Istanbul and the brutal rural customs of the remote countryside.Though Meryam is the central figure in the story and we certainly feel her anguish, the story focuses as much if not more on Cermal. She has already been tested by emotional adversity and forced to break with her culture as the story opens. Cermal's journey is just beginning. The ruse designed to hide the real intention behind the trip is going to visit their relatives in Istanbul. The couple they visit have fled the village and its harsh authoritarian relationship between parent and child. They understand what Cermel is being asked to do, but their view of honor killing is at least tempered by whether the woman was guilty of putting herself ""at risk"" to be raped. While Cermal is still caught in the throes of his culture's black and white thinking, they can see the gray. What makes the film most interesting is not the plot, it is the growth and struggle of the characters as they are forced to adjust to a new culture that lacks rigid scripts. It is the careful unfolding of these characters and the baring of a humanity, hidden beneath layers of prescribed attitudes and behaviors, that takes this film from good to great.",5,A Complex Look at Honor Killings,1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,1741,"['Bliss', 'film', 'status', 'symbolic', 'value', 'woman', 'Moslem', 'cultures', 'status', 'so', 'low', 'can', 'be', 'murdered', 'family', 'someone', 'Meryam', 'such', 'woman', 'being', 'viciously', 'raped', 'lacking', 'money', 'education', 'flee', 'fate', 'forced', 'follow', 'son', 'father', 'cousin', 'Cermal', 'Istanbul', 'where', 'been', 'ordered', 'kill', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'turned', 'bash', 'Islam', 'movie', 'instead', 'character', 'study', 'people', 'caught', 'modern', 'Islamic', 'world', 'Istanbul', 'brutal', 'rural', 'customs', 'remote', 'countryside.Though', 'Meryam', 'central', 'figure', 'story', 'certainly', 'feel', 'anguish', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'Cermal', 'already', 'been', 'tested', 'emotional', 'adversity', 'forced', 'break', 'culture', 'story', 'Cermal', 'journey', 'just', 'beginning', 'ruse', 'designed', 'hide', 'real', 'intention', 'trip', 'going', 'visit', 'relatives', 'Istanbul', 'couple', 'visit', 'have', 'fled', 'village', 'harsh', 'authoritarian', 'relationship', 'parent', 'child', 'understand', 'what', 'Cermel', 'being', 'asked', 'do', 'view', 'honor', 'killing', 'least', 'tempered', 'woman', 'was', 'guilty', 'putting', 'risk', 'be', 'raped', 'Cermal', 'still', 'caught', 'throes', 'culture', 'black', 'white', 'thinking', 'can', 'see', 'gray', 'What', 'film', 'most', 'interesting', 'not', 'plot', 'growth', 'struggle', 'characters', 'are', 'forced', 'adjust', 'new', 'culture', 'rigid', 'scripts', 'careful', 'unfolding', 'characters', 'baring', 'humanity', 'hidden', 'beneath', 'layers', 'prescribed', 'attitudes', 'behaviors', 'film', 'good', 'great']",Bliss

After all, it opens with the aftermath of a rape scene.Indeed, I stumbled on this 2007 movie masterfully acted by Ozgu Namal at the accidental nexus of another movie favorite of mine by the same title, Bliss, released in 1997.  Accidentally both have a somewhat connected theme.  More on that later.  By the way, I don't get the title at all here at all in this Turkish language film.  But I guess the movie marketers passed on ""Now here's an honor killing story you can relate to.""  No matter.This Bliss is about the fallout of a whack job version of Islam that embraces honor killings, which have made their way to western Europe and even the states; albeit to a lessor degree, thankfully.  Yes, thankfully.  For example, not quite the level we saw in Pakistan last month where a father murdered all six of his daughters while his wife watched, because two had boyfriends he was told, four siblings had colluded I guess.  He made his wife, their mother watch.  As the police carted him off, Arif Mubashir said he'd do it again in a heartbeat.  Yes, honor killings have not quite taken off in this country, still popular in the immigrant rich Netherlands that have logged a dozen or more of these executions.  The updated trick there: have her younger brother whack the lady.  The law goes easy on minors.This Bliss is a horse of a different color for sure, although it, too, deals with healing and hope.  This one is about the fallout of a versions of Islam happening near Turkey.  And, no secret that these honor killings have made their way to the states of course.  The stateside count, said USA Today, holds at at six as of mid 2009.There's an odd connection, actually, between these two movies which I gave 5 stars each.  The other Bliss, also a daring film, is the one by writer/director Lance Young where Terrance Stamp plays Baltazar, an off beat sex therapist Tantra guru in the 1997 movie Bliss becomes a quiet hero.  Both movies are about family and sexual trauma and healing and sexual dysfunction and the fear we have around talking about this stuff.I first heard of this this foreign language film on honor killings--takes place in Turkey--at the adjunct crossroad of another No Popcorn Here flick that is a true story:  The Stoning of Soraya M. --also not in English--which drove me to buy/read/review the book while touring the Holy Land in fact.Watch this movie which takes place around Istanbul.  Even if you don't like flicks with sub-titles.  It's about far more than junk religion and family values and misguided patriarchal so called honor.  It's a love story.  It's about three people who buck the tide and think for themselves.  Nice.And oh, I'm told Gloria Steinem is 77 this month.  So here's another reason to watch this flick: because if you didn't, your daughter did...forgot half of what Steinem tried to wake us up to back in the day.

1289451,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B002U4F5W2,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[9, 10]","""Bliss"" is the very best new movie I've seen in years, an enthralling, exquisite, moving, important film. Given current trends, I can't imagine a mainstream American film being this brave, this engaging, and this pertinent. If you are a thinking, feeling movie fan, see ""Bliss."" You won't regret it.Some reviews make ""Bliss"" sound like a National Geographic documentary about exotic foreigners, or an essay about honor killing, or a stab at Muslim-Western clashes, or a slide show of exotic Turkish locales. ""Bliss"" is none of those things. It is a movie-movie, a film that sucked me into its world and made me forget my surroundings; ""Bliss"" made me love and care about the characters onscreen from its opening shots. I was, at times, on the edge of my seat; I cried; I shouted at the screen; my palms sweat. After the film was over, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I wanted to grab all my movie fan friends and demand that they see it and that we sit up all night talking about it.That I loved the characters is testimony to how powerful this film is. Cemal (Murat Han), the main character, is a returning Turkish solider who's been off fighting terrorists. (The terrorists in question may be Kurds pressing for an independent Kurdish state, but the film never names them.) Cemal broods much, smiles little, carries a gun, suffers from PTSD, and is plagued by nightmares. He slavishly accepts, from his father, the all-powerful headman of his village, the job of honor killing his distant cousin, Meryem (Ozgu Namal), a nave village girl who has been raped. Cemal is a genuinely scary guy. He curses at Meryem, denouncing her as a ""whore"" and a ""bitch."" He slaps her. In some very tense scenes, he reveals himself quite ready to, and capable of, killing several people. And yet ""Bliss"" made me love Cemal, care about his fate, and see the world through his eyes. In fact, when Cemal fails at his first attempt to kill Meryem, and squats in shame, I felt sorry for him. That is powerful filmmaking. Murat Han is completely natural in the role. You never catch him acting. He just is Cemal.Ozgu Namal, as Meryem, gives an equally miraculous performance. Again, I felt, when watching this, as if I were watching real people. I've lived in pre-modern, traditional villages, and Namal and the other actors expertly capture the cringing, downtrodden posture that subservient people assume in the presence of their superiors in the village hierarchy. Men like Cemal cast their eyes down and say ""Yes, sir,"" when ordered around by the village headman; girls like Meryem, with no status whatsoever, cringe at all times, scuttling through life, struggling to assure their continued existence by continuously pleasing those above them - and those above them include everyone. Meryem cringes and looks away and plasters herself to a train seat when handing Cemal a pita bread sandwich she has made for him; he must eat and be satisfied before she can eat. Even when she gets a fish bone stuck in her throat her hands flutter and her eyes grow wide with anxiety as Cemal tries to keep her from choking - ironic given that his job is to kill her. She doesn't want to demand too much. Her body language says, ""Don't worry; I'll just choke to death. I don't want to be a bother."" Namal conveys the complex inner life of a girl who has been denied any identity or individuality by her crushing, loveless surroundings. In one scene, she talks about her relationship with her grandmother, and it is so poignant only a stonehearted filmgoer could avoid crying.But Turkey is not just traditional villages; it also has a coast where Western tourists and modernized Turks lounge in bikinis. Cemal and Meryem encounter Irfan (Talat Bulut), a renegade professor cruising the coast in his yacht. Irfan smiles and enjoys life; his hair is snowy white. He is bright opposite to brooding, dark, Cemal. But Irfan's life isn't perfect, either. He doesn't quite know how to fit his modern, sunny mentality into traditional Turkish culture.All scenes, even lighthearted ones, are shadowed by menace. The law is ironclad: Meryem must be killed by a member of her family. She has been raped; she is ""tainted,"" as Cemal puts it. There is a knife, a gun, a pair of strangling hands, hiding around every corner of every shot, even those on the professor's yacht. You know that no matter how far Meryem gets from her village, she is not going to find safety within the confines of this world, or this movie.Because this film caused me to care so much about Cemal, Meryem, and Irfan, I struggled with the questions they faced. How can a raped girl survive in a traditional Muslim village? If she escapes her village, where can she make a life for herself? Can she, ever? Can a girl who has been trained to cringe and serve and hide behind her veil ever fit in with Westernized Turkish girls, who, clad only in bikinis, visit Prof. Irfan's yacht? And what about Cemal? Will he always only be a man who responds with frightening rage when asked to set a table because that is ""women's work,"" who feels duty-bound to beat down any woman who questions his absolute, masculine authority? And who is to say which world is better, the village, with its tradition, or the professor's world, where he does seem truly without anchors?",5,"Enthralling, Exquisite, Must-See for Thinking, Feeling

It's an eye-opener.This film is totally engrossing, and even with the issue of the treatment of women in the horrific practice of ""honor"" killings, the story doesn't leave out the better side of human relationships: friendship and love.  This makes it very watchable and, in the end, leaves us feeling good, as well as informed.I can't help wondering if this trip away from the home village to complete the killing is an unlikely occurrence, and without this premise of the journey to another place, the movie could not have happened.

1289462,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002U4F5W2,Z Hayes,"[17, 19]","I would have missed this amazing film if not for it popping up as a suggested title on a movie rental website to which I subscribe. This movie (in Turkish with English subtitles) had such a profound impact on me that I am going to purchase it and try and get as many of my friends to watch it. The subject matter in ""Bliss"" or ""Mutluluk"" (it's Turkish title) is the practice of honor killing. This cruel and inhuman practice is prevalent in Middle Eastern countries, South Asian countries such as Pakistan, and yes, in Turkey. It is commonly practiced in traditional and fundamentalist Muslim societies, where a daughter's dishonor is regarded as one of the worst possible misfortune to befall a family - no matter if the daughter's dishonor was through no fault of her own, e.g. rape, molest, etc. The verdict in such cases is often a death sentence, not upon the perpetrator, but upon the daughter. I have read of young girls being beaten to death, drowned in the family pool, stoned to death, strangled, etc. A good read on this subject, amongst others is [[ASIN:0452283779 Price of Honor: Muslim Women Lift the Veil of Silence on the Islamic World, Newly updated].The movie focuses on 17-year-old Meryem (a brilliant Ozgu Namal) who is found  unconscious by the lake shore one morning in a state of dishevelment. Meryem lives in a small village in the Turkish countryside with her father, stepmother, and several other family members. Unable/unwilling to name her attacker, Meryem's father is convinced by a respected and notable village elder, Ali (Mustafa Avkiran) that the only way to put an end to gossip and to restore his family's good name is to have Meryem killed (for of course, the girl is considered at fault, this being a male-dominated society where females are expected to keep silent and remain submissive). The man chosen to carry out the murder (euphemistically referred to as honor killing) is Ali's son Cemal who has just returned from military service in the commando unit.Cemal (Murat Han)is at first reluctant  but is given no choice in the matter and he takes Meryem to Istanbul. Once there, Cemal's brother Yakub who has long since left the village and it's outdated and inhuman practices behind him, cautions Cemal against acting in haste. Cemal however has no choice since he cannot return to his village without having killed Meryem. Well, at the last moment, Cemal has a change of heart and both Cemal and Meryem go on the run. They eventually meet an ex-professor and liberated soul, Irfan Abi (Talat Bulut) who himself is escaping a bad marriage and the pair end up working on his boat as his crew. Unknown to the pair, Ali is now desperate to find his son and bent on seeing Meryem dead.I loved how the movie captures Meryem's journey from darkness into light. In the capable hands of actress Ozgu Namal, Meryem's character blossoms/matures from a naive young girl, unaccustomed to the sophisticated ways of the world outside her village to a young woman who truly finds a voice and refuses to let her bitter experience scar her forever. Irfan Abi as played by Talat Bunut effectively captures the older, more experienced sophisticate who acts as the pair's mentor whilst struggling to make peace with his own personal demons. Then there's the lead actor Murat Han as the young man Cemal who dares defy his father's wishes and listen to his own heart, as conflicted as that heart may be.This movie has all the elements of a good human drama - a compelling subject matter (which is never sensationalized, a true credit to the director), romance, and credible, heartfelt acting. Highly recommended!",5,"Gorgeously filmed, credibly acted human drama centering on a young woman's journey of hope",1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,3631,"['would', 'have', 'missed', 'amazing', 'film', 'not', 'popping', 'up', 'suggested', 'title', 'movie', 'rental', 'website', 'subscribe', 'movie', 'Turkish', 'English', 'subtitles', 'had', 'such', 'profound', 'impact', 'am', 'going', 'purchase', 'try', 'get', 'many', 'friends', 'watch', 'subject', 'matter', 'Bliss', 'Mutluluk', 'Turkish', 'title', 'practice', 'honor', 'killing', 'cruel', 'inhuman', 'practice', 'prevalent', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'countries', 'South', 'Asian', 'countries', 'such', 'Pakistan', 'yes', 'Turkey', 'commonly', 'practiced', 'traditional', 'fundamentalist', 'Muslim', 'societies', 'where', 'daughter', 'dishonor', 'regarded', 'one', 'worst', 'possible', 'misfortune', 'befall', 'family', 'matter', 'daughter', 'dishonor', 'was', 'fault', 'own', 'e.g', 'rape', 'molest', 'etc', 'verdict', 'such', 'cases', 'often', 'death', 'sentence', 'not', 'perpetrator', 'daughter', 'have', 'read', 'young', 'girls', 'being', 'beaten', 'death', 'drowned', 'family', 'pool', 'stoned', 'death', 'strangled', 'etc', 'good', 'read', 'subject', 'amongst', 'others', '[', '[', 'ASIN:0452283779', 'Price', 'Honor', 'Muslim', 'Women', 'Lift', 'Veil', 'Silence', 'Islamic', 'World', 'Newly', 'updated', ']', '.The', 'movie', '17-year-old', 'Meryem', 'brilliant', 'Ozgu', 'Namal', 'who', 'found', 'unconscious', 'lake', 'shore', 'one', 'morning', 'state', 'dishevelment', 'Meryem', 'small', 'village', 'Turkish', 'countryside', 'father', 'stepmother', 'several', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'Unable/unwilling', 'name', 'attacker', 'Meryem', 'father', 'convinced', 'respected', 'notable', 'village', 'elder', 'Ali', 'Mustafa', 'Avkiran', 'only', 'way', 'put', 'end', 'gossip', 'restore', 'family', 'good', 'name', 'have', 'Meryem', 'killed', 'course', 'girl', 'considered', 'fault', 'being', 'male-dominated', 'society', 'where', 'females', 'are', 'expected', 'keep', 'silent', 'remain', 'submissive', 'man', 'chosen', 'carry', 'out', 'murder', 'euphemistically', 'referred', 'honor', 'killing', 'Ali', 'son', 'Cemal', 'who', 'just', 'returned', 'military', 'service', 'commando', 'unit.Cemal', 'Murat', 'Han', 'first', 'reluctant', 'given', 'choice', 'matter', 'Meryem', 'Istanbul', 'Once', 'there', 'Cemal', 'brother', 'Yakub', 'who', 'long', 'left', 'village', 'outdated', 'inhuman', 'practices', 'cautions', 'Cemal', 'acting', 'haste', 'Cemal', 'however', 'choice', 'can', 'not', 'return', 'village', 'having', 'killed', 'Meryem', 'Well', 'last', 'moment', 'Cemal', 'change', 'heart', 'Cemal', 'Meryem', 'go', 'run', 'eventually', 'meet', 'ex-professor', 'liberated', 'soul', 'Irfan', 'Abi', 'Talat', 'Bulut', 'who', 'escaping', 'bad', 'marriage', 'pair', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'boat', 'crew', 'pair', 'Ali', 'now', 'desperate', 'find', 'son', 'bent', 'seeing', 'Meryem', 'dead.I', 'loved', 'how', 'movie', 'Meryem', 'journey', 'darkness', 'light', 'capable', 'hands', 'actress', 'Ozgu', 'Namal', 'Meryem', 'character', 'blossoms/matures', 'naive', 'young', 'girl', 'unaccustomed', 'sophisticated', 'ways', 'world', 'village', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'truly', 'voice', 'let', 'bitter', 'experience', 'scar', 'forever', 'Irfan', 'Abi', 'played', 'Talat', 'Bunut', 'effectively', 'older', 'more', 'experienced', 'sophisticate', 'who', 'pair', 'mentor', 'whilst', 'struggling', 'make', 'peace', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'Then', 'lead', 'actor', 'Murat', 'Han', 'young', 'man', 'Cemal', 'who', 'defy', 'father', 'wishes', 'listen', 'own', 'heart', 'as', 'conflicted', 'heart', 'may', 'be.This', 'movie', 'elements', 'good', 'human', 'drama', 'compelling', 'subject', 'matter', 'never', 'sensationalized', 'true', 'credit', 'director', 'romance', 'credible', 'heartfelt', 'acting', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Bliss
