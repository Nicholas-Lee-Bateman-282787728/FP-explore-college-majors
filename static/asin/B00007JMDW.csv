Although the plots are quite different, both involve a wacky portrayal of camping in the wilderness... so wacky as to seem almost completely random or incoherent in terms of how people actually deal with real outdoor situations. Both movies are ridiculous in this regards, but they are comedies and so it's possible, although at times difficult, to forgive their extravagence in this regards. What holds the movies together are the characters, plots, and, most of all, the humor. ""Bushwacked"" wins out over ""Without A Paddle"" in the humor department. There are several routines that are over-the-top (almost reminiscent of something you might see in a ""South Park"" episode), and which might be considered inappropriate by some since child actors are involved, but I say to heck with the prudes. ""Bushwacked"" is a fun movie with lots of good gags and very nearly worth each and every one of the four stars I rated it at!",4,Random Camping,1157673600,"09 8, 2006",2006,1021,"['were', 'compare', 'movie', 'other', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'recent', 'Paddle', 'plots', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'involve', 'wacky', 'portrayal', 'camping', 'wilderness', 'so', 'wacky', 'seem', 'almost', 'completely', 'random', 'incoherent', 'terms', 'how', 'people', 'actually', 'deal', 'real', 'outdoor', 'situations', 'movies', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'regards', 'are', 'comedies', 'possible', 'times', 'difficult', 'forgive', 'extravagence', 'regards', 'What', 'movies', 'together', 'are', 'characters', 'plots', 'most', 'humor', 'Bushwacked', 'out', 'Paddle', 'humor', 'department', 'are', 'several', 'routines', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'almost', 'reminiscent', 'something', 'might', 'see', 'South', 'Park', 'episode', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'inappropriate', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'involved', 'say', 'heck', 'prudes', 'Bushwacked', 'fun', 'movie', 'lots', 'good', 'gags', 'very', 'nearly', 'worth', 'one', 'four', 'stars', 'rated']",N/A

He struts his way down the street to Bee Gees tunes and behaves like Disco Stu from The Simpsons. He's got a little con going on after working hours in which he delivers clandestine packages to some rich guy (a weak Anthony Heald) for big tips. He needs escapism and the mystery of the con makes him feel like a spy. Until that is, when Max is framed for murder and has to run for his life.While trying to intercept the last in the series of suspicious packages (located in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest) in order to clear his name, Max is mistaken for a world famous Scout Leader and has to lead a bunch of adventure-hungry kids into the wilderness and shake off the pursuing FBI.Daniel Stern's physical comedy is just plain hilarious and his comic timing is perfect. For anyone who liked him in Home Alone 1 and 2 you'll love him in this also. The kids are surprisingly not that annoying. Usually I hate kids in movies (Jurassic Park, Hook, The awful Von Trapp children) but they had enough character and laughs among them to make it okay.I only ever had a problem with the ending. It was just too tame for a PG-13 rated movie. Instead of Gordy's far-fetched fall into the ravine I would have preferred that the entire balcony of the cabin to collapse and the bad guy fall to his death. Plus the bad guy is kind of weak, his accent is just plain odd and he has this strange sort of campness and not scariness about him. Too bad since Anthony Heald has played some true scumbags in his time.These 2 complains aside Bushwhacked is great adventure movie with a lively score by Bill Conti (why is there no soundtrack CD?). It's probably best enjoyed in Spring/Summer and is perfect for the whole family. An admirable amount of laughs indeed.The DVD is a godsend for anyone who had to suffer the terrible pan-and-scan video (like me), which half the picture missing. Now Bushwhacked is presented in full 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and it looks just fine. The sound is simple Dolby 2.0 but it's more than adequate. Extras are thin, consisting of just a Bushwhacked trailer (quite good) and couple of other Fox family movie trailers.But for the price, Bushwhacked is a must, regardless of extras or not.

When he's alone, he's just not that terrific. Plus, the blurb on the back of the case didn't really tell me what to expect from the movie. The blurb could have been re-written, to make it sound more appealing. Predictably, there's also a few Home Alone references thrown in there.Playing a hapless delivery man, with awful hair, he gets framed for murder, which leads him into all kinds of hi-jinx, including adopting the identity of Cub Scout leader. A kid hater at its worst, he becomes almost a Pied Piper type, as he leads the kids on a rowdy trek. Although Stern plays the loveable idiot quite well, it's painful to watch sometimes, as he's so OTT.The scenery, is a bonus about the movie, filmed around the Lake Tahoe area. A lot of the movie has taken its inspiration from other movies, particularly, I felt, the Honey I Shrunk The Kids series.I just wasn't sure about this movie.

729484,A1RZ1KIP4LJYDZ,B00007JMDW,"moviefreak ""moviefreak2003""","[2, 5]","Before I begin this review, let me make something clear.  This is not a good film, it is not a bad film, it is different.  Although the story line is unrealistic and the acting is below the level of good, Bushwhacked manages to squeeze past the realm of boring and stupid films into just being a plain average film worth renting but not buying.  Daniel Stern's downfall was probably after Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.  After the Home Alones success, it seemed that Stern had just retired or disappeared.  Now seen on the ABC show Regular Joe (which is probably going to be canceled), Stern has proven that he has lost his touch when he became the stupid hero instead of the guy who we wanted to get hurt.  Bushwhacked is not a big-budget film and it wasn't a box office blowout either but the vast array of child stars once again turns it into one of those Disney films where good always wins and gets rewards while evil is severely punished for lying and stealing.  DVD is barely worth it since it doesn't contain many extra features.  Bushwhacked is long forgotten if just never known because it was just nothing, a film that had no good stuff but no bad either.Stern stars at Max Grabelski, a wild and rude delivery man who after getting caught up in a web of lies, crooked F.B.I. agents, and money travels to Devil's Peak disguised as a forest ranger with several kids to find out what has happened.  No super actors or acting in this film and no spectacular effects either.Once again, Bushwhacked is a plain family film.  Rent it when you have nothing to do or nothing good is on TV.  As for buying, Bushwhacked will probably lie under a large pile of dust for years  to come.",3,Feels like a Disney film but jokes keep it from failing,1051660800,"04 30, 2003",2003,1684,"['begin', 'review', 'let', 'make', 'something', 'clear', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'different', 'story', 'line', 'unrealistic', 'acting', 'level', 'good', 'Bushwhacked', 'manages', 'squeeze', 'realm', 'boring', 'stupid', 'films', 'just', 'being', 'plain', 'average', 'film', 'worth', 'renting', 'not', 'buying', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'downfall', 'was', 'probably', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'Lost', 'New', 'York', 'Home', 'Alones', 'success', 'seemed', 'Stern', 'had', 'just', 'retired', 'disappeared', 'Now', 'seen', 'ABC', 'show', 'Regular', 'Joe', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'canceled', 'Stern', 'proven', 'lost', 'touch', 'when', 'became', 'stupid', 'hero', 'instead', 'guy', 'who', 'wanted', 'get', 'hurt', 'Bushwhacked', 'not', 'big-budget', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'box', 'office', 'blowout', 'vast', 'array', 'child', 'stars', 'once', 'again', 'one', 'Disney', 'films', 'where', 'good', 'always', 'wins', 'rewards', 'evil', 'severely', 'punished', 'lying', 'stealing', 'DVD', 'barely', 'worth', ""n't"", 'contain', 'many', 'extra', 'features', 'Bushwhacked', 'long', 'forgotten', 'just', 'never', 'known', 'was', 'just', 'nothing', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'stuff', 'bad', 'either.Stern', 'stars', 'Max', 'Grabelski', 'wild', 'rude', 'delivery', 'man', 'who', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'web', 'lies', 'crooked', 'F.B.I', 'agents', 'money', 'travels', 'Devil', 'Peak', 'disguised', 'forest', 'ranger', 'several', 'kids', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'super', 'actors', 'acting', 'film', 'spectacular', 'effects', 'either.Once', 'again', 'Bushwhacked', 'plain', 'family', 'film', 'Rent', 'when', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'nothing', 'good', 'TV', 'buying', 'Bushwhacked', 'will', 'probably', 'lie', 'large', 'pile', 'dust', 'years', 'come']",N/A
