828387,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B00029NLLO,Artist & Author,"[23, 27]","There is one aspect of this movie that I haven't seen mentioned anywhere, and I am surprised because it really is central to the story.  This movie shows only one Japanese soldier who was executed as a result of the trial.  (There were actually six executed by the time the trials were over; 85 went free.)  What is interesting about the man who was executed is that he was a Christian, a Roman Catholic.  He had already gone home to Japan, and was free.  We aren't told if he was a Christian before he went to the island where the prisoner of war camp was located, or if he converted while there, or after he went back home to Japan.However, he knew that he had executed one of the Australian airmen by beheading so he voluntarily went back to stand trial and to testify.  It is subtle, but very clear that he went back because of his Christian faith; that he had to tell the truth and face whatever the consequences may be.  While all the other Japanese on trial were lying about the execution of over 300 Australians, this one Christian Japanese soldier told the truth.  He could tell the truth because his faith was stronger than his human fear of death.  That encouraged one or two others to start to tell the truth.  The officer who actually ordered the killings was so angry he tore the cross necklace from this Christian Japanese's neck.I won't give the outcome of the movie for those who don't know it.  However, I will say that the movie ends with the camera focused on this Christian soldier's Rosary/crucifix held in his hands.  I would say that without this aspect of the movie, it never would have been made.  Who would want to watch a movie where 85 out of 91 brutal, heartless soldiers, killers, on trial went free because of their lying and the politics of the post-WWII period?",5,One Soldier's Faith,1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,1795,"['one', 'aspect', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'mentioned', 'anywhere', 'am', 'surprised', 'really', 'central', 'story', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'who', 'was', 'executed', 'result', 'trial', 'were', 'actually', 'six', 'executed', 'time', 'trials', 'were', 'over', '85', 'went', 'free', 'What', 'interesting', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'executed', 'was', 'Christian', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'had', 'already', 'gone', 'home', 'Japan', 'was', 'free', 'are', ""n't"", 'told', 'was', 'Christian', 'went', 'island', 'where', 'prisoner', 'war', 'camp', 'was', 'located', 'converted', 'there', 'went', 'back', 'home', 'Japan.However', 'knew', 'had', 'executed', 'one', 'Australian', 'airmen', 'beheading', 'so', 'voluntarily', 'went', 'back', 'stand', 'trial', 'testify', 'subtle', 'very', 'clear', 'went', 'back', 'Christian', 'faith', 'had', 'tell', 'truth', 'face', 'whatever', 'consequences', 'may', 'be', 'other', 'Japanese', 'trial', 'were', 'lying', 'execution', '300', 'Australians', 'one', 'Christian', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'told', 'truth', 'could', 'tell', 'truth', 'faith', 'was', 'stronger', 'human', 'fear', 'death', 'encouraged', 'one', 'two', 'others', 'start', 'tell', 'truth', 'officer', 'who', 'actually', 'ordered', 'killings', 'was', 'so', 'angry', 'tore', 'cross', 'necklace', 'Christian', 'Japanese', 'neck.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'outcome', 'movie', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'camera', 'focused', 'Christian', 'soldier', 'Rosary/crucifix', 'held', 'hands', 'would', 'say', 'aspect', 'movie', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Who', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'where', '85', '91', 'brutal', 'heartless', 'soldiers', 'killers', 'trial', 'went', 'free', 'lying', 'politics', 'post-WWII', 'period']",N/A
828388,A2809U2S14N0K1,B00029NLLO,BernardZ,"[6, 6]","I am not a great fan of Australian movies but this one is good.The story itself is of a small war crimes tribunal of major significance to Australians but no-one else. In February 1942, about 1000 soldiers mainly Australians were taken by the Japanese to a camp. When the camp was liberated in 1945, only 139 Allied POWs survived.  The film focus on the trial after the war mainly from the prosecution trying to pursue a case the public demanded but the Allied leaders found inconvenient and messy.  To do this they follow two events that occurred at the camp the mass killing of 300 Australian soldiers and execution of 4 Australian airmen. The tragedy at the end is the man who was executed by the court I think probably should not have been.  Even the prosecution did not want him executed. It is a common problem that it is harder in law to convict the person who ordered the event then the one who did it.The acting, I thought was good.The big problem when filming such an event is few actors would let themselves become skeletons, which is what the survivors are. So it is going to lack realism and there is nothing anyone can do about that. Even big budget movies have this problem. The filming was interesting mainly because it was done so cheaply. Check out the directors commentary, as he has some interesting comments on this topic.",5,In war often justice is not sweet,1199491200,"01 5, 2008",2008,1343,"['am', 'not', 'great', 'fan', 'Australian', 'movies', 'one', 'good.The', 'story', 'small', 'war', 'crimes', 'tribunal', 'major', 'significance', 'Australians', 'no-one', 'else', 'February', '1942', '1000', 'soldiers', 'mainly', 'Australians', 'were', 'taken', 'Japanese', 'camp', 'When', 'camp', 'was', 'liberated', '1945', 'only', '139', 'Allied', 'POWs', 'survived', 'film', 'focus', 'trial', 'war', 'mainly', 'prosecution', 'trying', 'pursue', 'case', 'public', 'demanded', 'Allied', 'leaders', 'found', 'inconvenient', 'messy', 'do', 'follow', 'two', 'events', 'occurred', 'camp', 'mass', 'killing', '300', 'Australian', 'soldiers', 'execution', '4', 'Australian', 'airmen', 'tragedy', 'end', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'executed', 'court', 'think', 'probably', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'Even', 'prosecution', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'executed', 'common', 'problem', 'harder', 'law', 'convict', 'person', 'who', 'ordered', 'event', 'then', 'one', 'who', 'did', 'it.The', 'acting', 'thought', 'was', 'good.The', 'big', 'problem', 'when', 'filming', 'event', 'few', 'actors', 'would', 'let', 'become', 'skeletons', 'what', 'survivors', 'are', 'going', 'lack', 'realism', 'nothing', 'anyone', 'can', 'do', 'Even', 'big', 'budget', 'movies', 'have', 'problem', 'filming', 'was', 'interesting', 'mainly', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'cheaply', 'Check', 'directors', 'commentary', 'interesting', 'comments', 'topic']",N/A
828389,A84TOOCIEF6FX,B00029NLLO,David Webb,"[1, 1]","Bryan Brown is the star of this film which deals with an Australian military trial of Japanese soldiers who were responsible for a WWII prison camp on a small island. The focus is on the trial and the aftermath of harsh treatment of Australian POWs by the Japanese. The ambiguities involved in bringing the miscreants to justice, and the political undertones involved in the trial are explored with potent dramatic effect. Russell Crowe has a small supporting role. The special feature interview with Crowe and Brown indicate that this was Russell's first film, and that he gained a lot of experience from interacting with Brown. Don't buy this if you expect to see a full blown Russell Crowe performance. However, his fans may treasure this initial sojourn by RC. George Takai has an important role as the senior Japanese officer who was in charge of the entire island. War crimes against the prisoners are revealed through flashbacks. This film was far better than I had imagined. It could have been just another prison camp drama but instead it dealt with the legal and moral dilemmas of bringing justice to war criminals. These are extremely important considerations especially now when it is clear that torture was used against prisoners held by the USA. I never thought I would live to see the day when senior American government officials would admit to torturing prisoners, and even promote the continued use of torture as an official policy of the USA. It is easy to pass judgement on what others did, especially when their acts were so odious. However, it is apparently difficult to turn the mirror on ourselves when we are in the position of authority over those we revile.
