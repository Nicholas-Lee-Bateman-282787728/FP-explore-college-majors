As a joke writer for artists (Bette, Whoopi, Billy, Robin), events (Academy Awards), and in his earlier days, TV (Brady Bunch Variety Show, Donny &amp; Marie), Vilanche is one of a few select go-to guys in Hollywood.The documentary mixes interviews with his clients, footage of his featured work, snippets of Vilanche himself speaking at awards ceremoies (he won an Emmy for his Oscar work) and rare performances, and, most interestingly, some work sessions. The last is the most interesting, as it provides some insight as to how Vilanche goes about creating his jokes.  His description of writing for different individuals - creating jokes and then voicing them appropriately, is fascinating.  The peek into the working process of different comedians (Midler, Crystal, Williams) is revealing both of Vilanche and his clients.What really makes this film work is that  Vilanche is as interesting as the stars he writes for - something that cannot be said of all comedy writers.",4,Great peek at the man behind the jokes,979516800,"01 15, 2001",2001,1155,"['now', 'fairly', 'widely', 'known', 'appearances', 'New', 'Hollywood', 'Squares', 'Bruce', 'Vilanche', 'work', 'been', 'heard', 'laughed', 'millions', 'people', 'worldwide', 'joke', 'writer', 'artists', 'Bette', 'Whoopi', 'Billy', 'Robin', 'events', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'earlier', 'days', 'TV', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Variety', 'Show', 'Donny', 'amp', 'Marie', 'Vilanche', 'one', 'few', 'select', 'go-to', 'guys', 'Hollywood.The', 'documentary', 'mixes', 'interviews', 'clients', 'footage', 'featured', 'work', 'snippets', 'Vilanche', 'speaking', 'awards', 'ceremoies', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Oscar', 'work', 'rare', 'performances', 'most', 'interestingly', 'work', 'sessions', 'last', 'most', 'interesting', 'insight', 'how', 'Vilanche', 'creating', 'jokes', 'description', 'writing', 'different', 'individuals', 'creating', 'jokes', 'then', 'voicing', 'appropriately', 'fascinating', 'peek', 'working', 'process', 'different', 'comedians', 'Midler', 'Crystal', 'Williams', 'revealing', 'Vilanche', 'clients.What', 'really', 'film', 'work', 'Vilanche', 'as', 'interesting', 'stars', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'comedy', 'writers']",Get Bruce VHS
